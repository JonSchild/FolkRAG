# Vector Stores Directory

This directory was initially intended to store vector stores for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. However, due to the large size of these files, keeping some of them in the repository is impractical.

## Storage
Vector stores should be loaded into this repository.
  - Use a **virtual machine (VM)** or **local machine** for storage and processing for large vector stores.

The Git repo already houses two smaller vector stores based on a small subset of the data, originally intended for testing.
