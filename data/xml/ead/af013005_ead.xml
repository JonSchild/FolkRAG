    On May 12, 2009, the U.S. Congress authorized a national initiative by passing The Civil
            Rights History Project Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-19). The law directed the Library of
            Congress (LOC) and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American
            History and Culture (NMAAHC) to conduct a survey of existing oral history collections
            with relevance to the civil rights movement, and to record new interviews with people
            who participated in the movement.
   </p>
   <p>
    The American Folklore Society (AFS) oversaw a research team of four scholars who
            gathered information for the survey in 2010. The information was compiled into the
    <ref actuate="onrequest" href="https://www.loc.gov/folklife/civilrights/survey/index.php" show="embed">
     CRHP National Survey
               Database of Civil Rights Collections
    </ref>
    in 2011 by Washington State University's
            Center for Digital Scholarship and Curation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The NMAAHC sponsored six initial interviews in late 2010. The NMAAHC contracted with the
            University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Southern Oral History Program to conduct
            50 more interviews in 2011, recorded by Media Generation. An additional 52 interviews
            were conducted in 2013; and 37 interviews conducted in 2016. Videography and tech
            support was provided by the UNC Southern Oral History Program, Smithsonian Center for
            Folklife and Cultural Heritage, and Future View Inc.
   </p>
   <p>
    Curation, preservation, and access to the interviews is a joint undertaking of the
            American Folklife Center and the NMAAHC.

    Scope and Content
   </head>
   <p>
    The collection contains 145 filmed oral history interviews of 175 participants in the
            United States civil rights movement and their family members. Also includes interview
            transcripts and photographs. The oral histories were conducted by historians Julian
            Bond, Taylor Branch, David P. Cline, Emilye Crosby, John Dittmer, Will Griffin, Hasan
            Kwame Jeffries, Joseph Mosnier, LaFleur Paysour, Dwandalyn Reece, Patricia Sullivan, and
            Kieran Walsh Taylor. Most of the interviews were filmed by John Bishop.
   </p>
   <p>
    The interviews were conducted with activists who were also lawyers, judges, doctors,
            farmers, journalists, professors, union organizers, teachers, and musicians, among other
            occupations. The interviews cover a wide variety of topics within the civil rights
            movement, such as the influence of the labor movement, nonviolence and self-defense,
            religious faith, music, and the experiences of young activists. Most interviewees
            belonged to national organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement
            of Colored People (NAACP), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), or the Student
            Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). They also belonged to specialized and local
            groups including the Medical Committee for Human Rights (MCHR), the Deacons for Defense
            and Justice, the Cambridge (Maryland) Nonviolent Action Committee, Law Students Civil
            Rights Research Council (LSCRRC), the National Student Association (NSA), the Nonviolent
            Action Group (NAG), and the Newark Community Union Project. Some interviews were
            conducted in groups with families, couples, or participants of the same event. Several
            of the interviews were conducted with the children of civil rights leaders including
            Clara Luper, Robert Hicks, Gayle Jenkins, Ralph Abernathy and Oliver Hill, Sr.
            Interviews were also conducted with activists who worked in cities that are not
            well-known for their civil rights movement history, including Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;
            Saint Augustine, Florida; Seattle, Washington; and Bogalusa, Louisiana. Major civil
            rights movement events discussed in the interviews include the Albany Movement, the
            Selma to Montgomery Rights March, the Orangeburg Massacre, the March on Washington, the
            Freedom Rides, Mississippi Freedom Summer, the riots of 1968, and the murder of Emmett
            Till.

                     involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, the harassment they faced from white
                     supremacists, and their role in registering black voters.

       Grace Hall Miller (mother of activist
                     Shirley Sherrod) describes her childhood in Baker County, Georgia, her
                     education in segregated schools, her marriage to Hosie Miller, and their early
                     involvement in the Civil Rights Movement. Grace Hall Miller's commitment to the
                     Baker County Movement grew following the murder of her husband by a white
                     neighbor in 1965. She describes how her house became headquarters for the local
                     movement and how the community rallied to support her and her children.
                     Miller's children were among the black students who integrated white schools,
                     and because of their experience, she dedicated much of her life to improving

       Mary Jenkins describes Albany, Georgia,
                     during her childhood and discusses moments when she encountered racial
                     prejudice. She describes her education in all-black schools, her decision to
                     attend Fisk University, and her longing to become a teacher. Around the time of
                     Brown v. Board of Education, she began teaching in Georgia and witnessed
                     negative reactions of white administrators to the decision. Jenkins describes
                     her decision to join the Albany Movement, and she shares memories of working
                     with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

       Julia Matilda Burns describes her
                     experience in segregated schools in Humphreys County, Mississippi, where she
                     grew up. After becoming a teacher at Marshall High School in Belzoni,
                     Mississippi, she began to take notice of the Civil Rights Movement, but her
                     involvement was limited because she did not want to lose her job. Burns
                     describes protests by whites against school desegregation in Tchula,
                     Mississippi, and her experiences as a teacher in Tchula. She also discusses her
                     successful election for a position on the school board and the work she
                     accomplished during her tenure.

       </emph>
       Rosie Head describes her early life in
                     Greenwood, Mississippi, where her family lived and worked on a plantation. She
                     discusses how her parents faced racial discrimination in their work and how
                     they were cheated by the plantation owner and then blacklisted. In 1964, Head
                     joined the Civil Rights Movement in Tchula, Mississippi, where her family had
                     relocated. Head recounts the various ways she was involved in the movement:
                     registering voters, working with Freedom Summer volunteers, helping to
                     establish the Child Development Group of Mississippi, and campaigning for black
                     candidates for political office.

       Dr. Jack Geiger discusses his early life
                     experiences and how he came to be a leading figure in the Medical Committee for
                     Human Rights. He describes his childhood in New York City, where he found a

                     grew, especially after a trip to South Africa. He eventually volunteered as a

                     white supremacist and Ku Klux Klan meetings. After being driven out of
                     Mississippi by threats, he joined the Chatham County Crusade for Voters in

                     end to segregation at private clubs and participated in the anti-apartheid

       Martha Prescod Norman Noonan describes her
                     childhood in Providence, Rhode Island, and being one of the few black families
                     in the neighborhood. Her parents urged her to attend the University of

                     about the Civil Rights Movement in the South. She eventually made her way to
                     Albany, Georgia, where she worked with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
                     Committee. She also worked in the Movement in Mississippi and later in Alabama.
                     Noonan describes the March on Washington, her perception of Mississippi Freedom
                     Summer, and the early iterations of Black Power.

                     childhood experiences informed his later activism and identity. Baseball was

                     SCOPE during his first year at UCLA, after Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., visited

       speech, which King delivered at the March on Washington in 1963. Jones
                     also describes his early life living in a Philadelphia home for indigent black
                     orphans and foster children, because his parents, who were both domestic
                     workers, could not afford to provide for him. Jones talks about his education
                     at Columbia University, his training as a classical clarinetist, and some of
                     his early encounters with leftist politics while in New York. Jones discusses

                     University Law School, and his move to California to become an entertainment

        Summary:
       </emph>
       Charles Siler remembers his early life in
                     Louisiana, including a penchant for drawing that began before the age of two,
                     quitting the Boy Scouts when his troop made black Scouts walk behind the horses
                     in a local parade, and picketing Louisiana's segregated State Library as a
                     senior in high school. He was eventually expelled from Southern University
                     because of his activism. He joined the National Association for the Advancement
                     of Colored People (NAACP) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He was drafted in 1967 and
                     served in the military in the Vietnam War. He continued his civil rights
                     advocacy as he took a variety of positions at cultural institutions and began a
                     career as a cartoonist. The interview closes with Siler's reflections on
                     identity and the process of learning from those who are ideologically
                     different.

       Basketball player Bill Russell remembers
                     his childhood in Louisiana and Oakland, California, in the 1940s. After winning
                     two Final Fours with the University of San Francisco, he won an Olympic gold

                     Russell would win, including eight in a row. Russell had a difficult
                     relationship with the sports media in Boston, but a better one with his Celtics
                     teammates. He defends the organization as progressive on racial matters (as
                     opposed to the Red Sox) and describes a post-retirement reconciliation with
                     Boston that resulted in considerable Red Sox support for his mentoring
                     organization and a statue of him, erected in 2013.

                     Millard Fuller were inspired to start Habitat for Humanity. She describes her

                     the organization as well as linking it to the Civil Rights Movement.

       Lonnie C. King shares his memories of
                     growing up in Atlanta, where he attended Ebenezer Baptist Church and was close
                     with Martin Luther King, Jr.'s family. He recalls his stint in the U.S. Navy,
                     his years as a student at Morehouse College, and the Student Nonviolent
                     Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Atlanta in the 1960s. He also remembers his
                     relationships with older African American leaders in Atlanta, including Martin
                     Luther King, Sr., Benjamin Mays, and Rufus Clement, and the various boycotts
                     and protests staged by the Atlanta Student Movement while he was its
                     director.

       The interviewees in this group interview
                     were students who staged a walkout in 1951 at the all black, segregated Adkin
                     High School in Kinston, North Carolina, to protest unequal conditions. The
                     interviewees describe their family backgrounds, life in segregated Kinston, and
                     Adkin High School. They remember learning that their school was unequal to the
                     all-white school from which they were barred, and planning and staging a
                     school-wide walkout and march without the assistance of any adults. They also
                     discuss their lives since high school.

       Cecilia Suyat Marshall, a
                     Filipino born in Hawaii, came to the United States in 1948. She worked as a
                     secretary for the NAACP before marrying civil rights lawyer Thurgood

        Summary:
       </emph>
       Cecilia Suyat Marshall recalls moving from
                     Hawaii to New York where she found a job as a secretary with the National
                     Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1948. Marshall
                     notes some of the highlights of her experiences at the NAACP offices, including
                     the organization's victory in the Brown v. Board case, traveling the South with
                     NAACP staff, and attending conferences. There she met the many local people who
                     gave the Civil Rights Movement strength. She left the organization after her
                     marriage to Thurgood Marshall, and with that departure became more of a mother
                     and wife than an activist, but retained her activist spirit with membership on
                     the boards of progressive organizations.

                     College and became a research analyst for the Department of Justice's Civil
                     Rights Division. John grew up in Gastonia, North Carolina, where FBI agents
                     kept tabs on his family, attended Duke University, served in the Air Force, and
                     attended the University of North Carolina School of Law. He became an attorney
                     with the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, which became effective
                     after reorganization by John Doar. Much of this interview concerns Jean and
                     John's work with the Civil Rights Division, including support for voter
                     registration efforts in Georgia and Alabama, the investigation of the Hartman
                     Turnbow case, in which a black activist was arrested for an arson attempt on
                     his own home, and an effort to address a murder in Mississippi. John also
                     addresses the effects of the Voting Rights Act in the South, the role of the
                     lawyers in the Civil Rights Division in relation to the FBI and local law
                     enforcement, and a variety of other cases and issues he dealt with. After
                     retirement, the Rosenbergs founded the Appalachian Citizens Law Center.

        Summary:
       </emph>
       Robert Brown describes his childhood in
                     High Point, North Carolina, the poverty and segregation that defined his
                     childhood, and how his grandmother influenced him by telling stories about his
                     family's history during slavery. Brown became one of the first black policemen
                     in High Point and later transitioned to a position as a federal agent in New
                     York. He returned to North Carolina in 1960 to start a public relations firm, B
                     &amp; C Associates, Inc., which advised companies about how to change policies
                     on race and segregation. Brown also shares stories about serving as a special
                     assistant to President Richard Nixon and his role in bringing attention to
                     apartheid in South Africa through his relationship with Nelson Mandela and his
                     family.

       The Reverend Doctor Harry Blake discusses

       </emph>
       Donzaleigh Abernathy, Juandalynn Abernathy,
                     and Ralph Abernathy, III, recall their father, Ralph David Abernathy and their
                     own experiences as children in the Civil Rights Movement. The Abernathy
                     children spent much of their childhoods with the children of Martin Luther
                     King, Jr. Unlike the King children, the Abernathy siblings actively
                     participated in direct action, including the Poor People's Campaign. All three
                     children felt palpably the fear of violence in their everyday lives. This
                     interview offers an intimate portrait of the home of a civil rights icon and of
                     the intense friendship between Abernathy and King.

        Summary:
       </emph>
       Charles McLaurin discusses his work as a
                     Civil Rights activist in the 1950's and 60's. He begins by discussing the
                     racism he experienced growing up and how this shaped his personal and political
                     values. McLaurin mainly describes working with African American voter
                     registration rights issues, SNCC, and the Freedom Riders. He describes how he
                     became a congressional officer for a number of years in Mississippi, working
                     closely with Fannie Lou Hamer as her congressional campaign manager. McLaurin
                     describes his involvement in a range of Mississippi-based protests, as well as
                     his experiences with the judicial system and his personal arrests.

        Biographical History:
       </emph>
       Dorothy "Dottie" Zellner was
                     born on January 14th, 1938 in New York City. She joined the NAACP in high
                     school, and later went to Miami, Florida to enroll in a CORE workshop, training
                     in non-violent organizing. Under CORE, she moved to New Orleans and was
                     involved with "casing" sites for sit-ins and outreach to the white community.
                     Dotty left CORE and was hired by the Southern Regional Council and moved to
                     Atlanta in June of 1961. Later that year, she became involved with SNCC,
                     organizing a Civil Liberties Workshop in the spring of 1963, and later marrying
                     her husband Bob Zellner the following August. In 1964 she moved to Boston with
                     her husband forming a Northeast Regional Office of SNCC while recruiting and
                     interviewing prospective volunteers for the Freedom Summer Project. In 1965,
                     Dottie had a daughter, and moved back to Atlanta with her new child and
                     husband. She and her husband wrote a Grassroots Organizing Work (GROW) proposal
                     to SNCC, to stay a part of the organization. She later moved to New Orleans to
                     work with Anne and Carl Braden of the Southern Conference Education Fund (SCEF)
                     for five years. Zellner worked as a nurse for several years before joining the
                     Center for Constitutional Rights in 1984. In 1998, she became director of
                     publications and development for the Queens College School of Law. She lectures
                     and writes frequently about the civil rights movement and co-edited Hands on

        Summary:
       </emph>
       Dorothy Zellner reflects on her experience
                     as one of the early organizers in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
                     (SNCC). Offering a unique perspective as a white woman in a black-led
                     organization, she sheds light on the dynamics of race and gender in the Civil
                     Rights Movement. Detailing the efforts of her and her then husband Bob Zellner,
                     she discusses her involvement in organizing civil liberties workshops, forming
                     a Northeast Regional Office of SNCC, and her role in recruiting Northern
                     volunteers for the 1964 Freedom Summer Project. She discusses SNCC's decision
                     to exclude white workers by the late 1960s and reflects on the complexities of
                     this consensus. Emphasizing how SNCC was dynamic in its ability to function as
                     a non-racial community, she considers its deterioration an endured loss for
                     American society. She continues to pride SNCC as her life's work, to this
                     day.

       Timothy Jenkins was born in
                     Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on December 30, 1938, and was raised in a family
                     invested in education. He received full tuition funding from a scholarship to
                     Howard University in 1956. He stayed connected to the university after he
                     graduated through his position as the National Affairs Vice President for the
                     United States National Student Association. This position is also how he got
                     involved with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). He later
                     went to law school at Yale, which was integral to his contributions to the
                     Civil Rights Movement. Jenkins' role in the SNCC summer meeting of 1961 was
                     particularly important in deciding to create Freedom Schools. He also attended
                     and helped organize the Greenwood Folk Festival, and other folk festivals. He
                     continues his involvement with law and racial justice.

        Summary:

       Timothy Jones discusses his personal
                     experiences growing up in Philadelphia and in particular his experiences in
                     integrated school. He describes at length his experience attending Howard
                     University, and why Howard was so important to the Civil Rights Movement. He
                     describes how he became a lawyer, and his political involvement with the Civil
                     Rights Movement as an African American lawyer. Jenkins discusses some of the
                     nuances of the political climate of the 1960s, and how that influenced SNCC's
                     decision-making process. Jenkins concludes the interview by recalling the three
                     events that he felt he directly affected the course of history.

       Juadine Henderson was born in
                     Batesville, Mississippi and attended church regularly growing up. She learned
                     about the NAACP, SNCC, and the Freedom Songs through her church. In June of
                     1963 she went to Greenwood, Mississippi with John Smith of SNCC to attend a one
                     week voter registration workshop, and shortly after decided to join the
                     movement and began work with voter registration programs. Henderson was
                     arrested on multiple occasions because of her involvement with the Civil Rights
                     Movement. She attended Bishop College, George Washington University, and

       Freddie Greene was born in Greenwood,

       </emph>
       Reginald Robinson was born in
                     Baltimore, Maryland in 1939. After leaving high school during the eleventh
                     grade to work, he eventually attended Cortez Peters Business College, where he
                     first got involved in civil rights through the student organization, Civic
                     Interest Group. He quickly became involved with the Student Nonviolent
                     Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1961. Working for SNCC as a field secretary,
                     his duties focused on supporting voter registration in McComb, Mississippi and
                     Cambridge, Maryland. After SNCC, he worked multiple jobs around the country
                     before finally settling in Washington, DC, where he eventually retired in
                     2001.

       Reginald "Reg" Robinson shares his
                     experience of working for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)
                     and how he became known as an "advance man" throughout the Civil Rights
                     Movement. Beginning with his involvement with the student-led Civic Interest
                     Group in Baltimore, Maryland, he discusses how his involvement with the
                     Cambridge Movement led him to becoming a field secretary for SNCC. He recalls
                     how Voter Education Programs and various recruitment activities of SNCC
                     epitomized the rule of "building and growing" and prides himself for remaining
                     committed to ensuring civil rights today.

        Biographical History:
       </emph>
       Jennifer Lawson was born in
                     June of 1946, in Fairfield, Alabama and encountered racial segregation as a
                     young child. Lawson later attended Tuskegee College. In the summer of 1963 she
                     moved to New York City to pursue an internship at Sloan Kettering Center and in
                     the summer of 1964 pursued a Research Aide role, meanwhile attending
                     demonstrations to protest Martin Luther King in Birmingham Jail. While at
                     Tuskegee she was involved with the student group that worked on desegregating
                     Macon County and mobilizing voting registration. After Freedom Summer 1964, she
                     went to Jackson, Mississippi to work on voter registration, and later left
                     school in the Spring of 1966 to join SNCC and work in Wilcox County. After she
                     left SNCC, she worked at the National Council of Negro Women and worked with
                     Dorothy Height and Fanny Lou Hamer. She was involved with designing the symbol
                     of the Black Panther for the Lowndes County Party, and created political
                     education material through art. Lawson was elected to the central coordinating
                     committee of SNCC, and then moved to Atlanta. At the time when SNCC began to
                     adopt racial separatism, she left the organization. She attended Columbia
                     University to pursue art in formal education, and studied film, working in
                     public television for the last thirty years. Lawson is active in volunteering
                     with the SNCC Legacy Project today.

        Summary:
       </emph>
       Jennifer Lawson shares her experience
                     throughout the Civil Rights Movement. She discusses her decision to leave
                     college to join the movement, and her involvement with voter registration
                     activities in Mississippi. She joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

                     coordinating committee. She shares her role in designing the Black Panther
                     symbol and campaign materials for the Lowndes Country Freedom Organization
                     (later the Black Panther Party). She reflects on the issues surrounding racial
                     separatism and her decision to leave organizational efforts in search of other
                     activist work, including joining the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW).
                     She recalls going to Cuba and being involved with art programs that celebrated
                     African and Cuban heritage and moved to Tanzania from 1970-1972 and became part
                     of a writer's group with Walter Rodney. She later attended Columbia University
                     to merge her interest in civil rights activism and art, and pursued a film
                     degree.

        Summary:
       </emph>
       Joseph and Embry Howell recall the summer
                     of 1966 in Southern Georgia. Recruited by Charlie Sherrod of the Student
                     Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) they discuss the complexities they
                     encountered from embodying a white identity, most significantly through their
                     experience of living with a black family in the South. They emphasize how
                     changing racial perception and power influenced a shift in SNCC's tactic of
                     nonviolence, ultimately leading to greater forms of militancy under ideologies
                     of Black Power. In spite of the complicated nature of navigating racial
                     tension, they remained committed to working with voting registration
                     activities, organizing efforts, and the Head Start program and were guided by
                     the belief of helping others.

        Biographical History:
       </emph>
       Reverend E. Maynard Moore was
                     born in Petersburg, Virginia in 1938. In his youth, he was generally unaware of
                     the segregation in his community. As a teenager, he participated in the
                     Methodist Student Movement and began to interact with black students in other
                     Methodist groups and became aware of civil rights issues. After attending
                     undergraduate college at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia, he went
                     to seminary school at Southern Methodist University in 1959. He participated in
                     sit-ins in the Dallas area and worked with migrant communities during summer
                     breaks. In 1964, he was accepted to the University of Chicago Divinity School
                     to do doctoral work. During this time, he and classmates drove from Chicago to
                     join the march to Montgomery for the last few miles. In 1966, he became the
                     national coordinator for Student Interracial Ministry. For most of his career,
                     he has focused on urban ministry projects.

        Summary:
       </emph>
       Maynard E. Moore shares his experience in
                     the Civil Rights Movement as a minister and how the intersection of religion
                     and education provided an opportunity for racial integration. He recalls his
                     involvement in the Methodist Student Movement from his early career as a
                     migrant camp worker, to later pursuits in doctoral education, up to his
                     participation in the Selma march. Emphasizing the commitment to non-violence,
                     he discusses how religion grounded the efforts of Civil Rights activists, was
                     used as a tactic to navigate racial tension in the South, and inspired the
                     growth and mobilization of student-led action groups.

       Lieutenant General Julius W.
                     Becton, Jr., United States Army, retired, was born in 1926 in Bryn Mawr,
                     Pennsylvania. He joined the Army Air Corps in July 1944 and graduated from
                     Infantry Officer Candidate School in 1945. Becton originally separated from the
                     Army in 1946, but he returned to active duty in 1948 when the Army was
                     officially desegregated. Eventually, rising to the rank of Lieutenant General,
                     he served during both the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and retired from the
                     U.S. Army in 1983 after nearly 40 years of service. After retirement, he has
                     held numerous positions including: Director of Disaster Assistance for the
                     Agency for International Development (AID), the director of the Federal

       Gloria Arellanes was born in
                     East Los Angeles in 1946. As a child, her family purchased a home in El Monte,
                     California, where she experienced racism. Her father was a Mexican immigrant
                     and her mother was Tongva Indian, but her parents encouraged her to identify as
                     Chicana in school. After graduating high school, Gloria became involved in
                     community work with Youth Temporary Employment Project (YTEP) and Neighborhood
                     Adult Participation Project (NAPP). In 1967, she became involved with the Brown
                     Berets and the Chicano movement, running the Brown Beret free clinic. After
                     leaving the Brown Berets, she has focused on her indigenous roots and has been
                     an active member of her tribe.

       Michael D. "Mac" McCarty was
                     born in 1950 in Chicago. As a young man, he attended St. Ignatius College Prep,
                     where he started a Black Student Union, and he was subsequently expelled for
                     his involvement in protests. In 1968, he joined the Black Panther Party as part
                     of the education cadre. He left the party after the assassination of Fred
                     Hampton. He joined the Army in 1972 to avoid being a target of the FBI. After
                     leaving the military, he became an acupuncturist. Since 1992, he has been a

       Carlos Montes was born in 1947
                     in El Paso, Texas. He was raised in Juarez, Mexico for part of his childhood,
                     and moved to Los Angeles in 1956. While attending East L.A. Community College,
                     he became involved with various Chicano organizations and eventually co-founded
                     the Brown Berets. He was an organizer of the Chicano Blowouts in East L.A., and
                     he participated in numerous protests including the Poor People's Campaign. In
                     1970 he fled the country and lived underground for several years in both Juarez
                     and El Paso. Since returning to L.A. in 1980, he has been involved with
                     immigration reform, Chicano rights, freeing political prisoners, and community
                     organizing.

        Summary:
       </emph>
       Carlos Montes, founding member of the Brown
                     Berets, talks about his decades-long involvement and activism in the Brown
                     Berets, the Brown Power movement, MEChA, the East L.A. blowouts, the Chicano
                     moratorium against the Vietnam War, the anti-Iraq war protests, his political
                     persecution at the hands of federal and local authorities. He recounts
                     participating in the inter-racial coalition that occupied the Mall in
                     Washington, DC, for the Poor People's Campaign (1968), and the ways in which
                     that experience opened up the consciousness of the Brown Berets to the global
                     struggle against class oppression and imperialism. He talks about the
                     circumstances of his arrest on arson charges in 1969, and having to flee the
                     country in the face of relentless, racist persecution of himself and other
                     Chicano activists. He recalls community action programs and events that
                     challenged the Brown Power movement.

       Maria Varela was born in 1940
                     in Newell, Pennsylvania. She attended college at Alverno College in Milwaukee,
                     where she was student body president and became aware of Student Nonviolent
                     Coordinating Committee (SNCC) while attending the National Student Association
                     Congress. She later joined SNCC and worked in Selma, Alabama and Mississippi as
                     a photographer and media creator. In 1968, she moved to New Mexico where she
                     worked with the Land Grant Movement and the Chicano Press Association. Varela
                     received her M.A. from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst in 1982. She
                     later became a visiting professor at Colorado College and then adjunct
                     professor at University of New Mexico. She helped organize rural development
                     and founded Los Ganados del Valle and helped found Tierra Wools co-op, which
                     re-introduced native sheep stock to Hispano and Native American land-holders
                     and small ranchers.

       Activist and MacArthur fellow, Maria
                     Varela, recalls her role in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
                     (SNCC), discussing her work in organizing adult literacy programs in

                     SNCC embraced multiculturalism, extending its activism to include the Chicano

        Biographical History:
       </emph>
       Ericka Huggins was born Ericka
                     Jenkins in 1948 in Washington, D.C. Huggins was the youngest of three. After
                     graduating high school in 1966, she attended Cheyney State College and from
                     there enrolled at Lincoln University, an HBCU in Philadelphia, where she met
                     her husband, Vietnam veteran John Huggins. Both moved to California after
                     reading about the Black Panther Party in Ramparts magazine, and joined the BPP
                     in 1967. After her husband's assassination in 1969, she became a leader in the
                     Los Angeles chapter and later led the Black Panther Party chapter in New Haven,
                     CT. She was the Director of the Black Panther Party's Oakland Community School
                     from 1973-1981. Huggins was a Professor of Sociology at Laney College in
                     Oakland and at Berkeley City College. In addition, she has lectured at

        Summary:
       </emph>
       Ericka Huggins discusses joining the Los
                     Angeles Chapter of the Blank Panther Party in 1967. She shares her involvement
                     with community survival programs such as the People's Free Medical Clinics and
                     Breakfast Programs. Sharing how these programs were often undervalued and
                     overlooked by the suspicions of the police and the FBI, she sheds considerable
                     light on the turbulent experience of being a Panther woman. In spite of the
                     assassination of her husband and being imprisoned multiple times on conspiracy
                     charges, she emphasizes the importance of remaining resilient and committed to
                     issues of racial injustice and remains active in civic organizations today.

        Biographical History:
       </emph>
       Elbert "Big Man" Howard was
                     born in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1938. After serving four years in the
                     military, he enrolled in Merritt College in Oakland, where he met Bobby Seale
                     and Huey P. Newton. Together they founded the Black Panther Party. As one of
                     the Party's early organizers, he played a key role in creating the Ten-Point
                     Program, organizing defense committees and developing programs and
                     opportunities for activism. After leaving the party in the 1970s, he returned
                     to the South and worked in retail in various locations for several years.
                     Eventually he returned to California where he wrote, lectured, and was a jazz
                     disc jockey.

        Summary:
       </emph>
       Elbert "Big Man" Howard founded the Black
                     Panther Party in Oakland with Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale and others in 1965.
                     Howard speaks of the Party's accomplishments in establishing the free community
                     food programs, free medical clinics, and other service initiatives. He recounts
                     the harassment by the FBI's COINTELPRO initiative, and recounts instances of
                     everyday racist oppression by the state and local officials. Howard talks about
                     the failed attempt by the Panthers to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the
                     Attica Prison Uprising (NY) in 1971. Howard talks of his leaving the
                     organization due to various pressures and internal conflicts that eventually
                     led to the demise of the Party.
