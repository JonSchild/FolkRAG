   <p>
    Collection of 328 video interviews and supporting photographs, videos, and
                manuscripts. Also included are Dr. Luft's related published materials. The
                interviews, which are in Series 1, are primarily first-person narratives told by
                World Trade Center site disaster workers: police officers, firefighters,
                construction workers, demolition specialists, ironworkers, veterinarians,
                paramedics, and other volunteers at the site. The interviews were conducted by Dr.
                Luft and his associates. Some individuals' full names have been redacted - please
                see Access and Restrictions note for more information. The recordings vary in
                length, but generally run from thirty minutes to 2 hours. The supporting images,
                videos, and manuscripts were given to Dr. Luft by interviewees. These supporting
                records, which are primarily visual materials, document events immediately following
                the attack on the World Trade Center through the cleanup of the site. Dr. Luft's
                published materials in Series 2 include the feature-length documentary he produced,
    <title render="italic">
     <part>
      9/11: An American Requiem

    Interviews number 188, 228, and 271 and their accompanying documentation were
                destroyed by Dr. Luft at the request of the interviewees. These deletions occurred

       John, demolition foreman and presently an advocate, was in Nanuet, NY in
                            charge of a large demolition job on September 11, 2001. When he heard of
                            the attacks, he shut down the job and returned to the New York City
                            immediately. In the first few days of the clean-up work, a steel beam
                            landed on his foot. After 10 days in the hospital, he developed
                            gangrene, and eventually, he lost half of his foot. He spent a total of
                            11 weeks in a hospital bed, but complete recovery took much longer. John
                            reveals his mental struggle after this injury and how the experience
                            altered his perception of his life and what is important to him as a
                            person. Between 2001 and 2006, John underwent multiple surgeries and
                            spent this extended period in a cast and on crutches. He would not be
                            able to work at his job again, but his injury inspired him to advocate
                            for other responders, and he founded the FealGood Foundation. In his
                            work as an advocate, he always found those who were worse off than him
                            and he learned the best way to deal with the many tragedies of September
                            11, 2001 disaster was to focus on the positive and the unity of the
                            human spirit that he witnessed as a responder.

       In September, 2001, Anthony lived in Oakdale, NY and commuted into the
                            city where he was an NYPD officer assigned to highway patrol. He and his
                            wife, Wendy, were expecting their first child. That morning he was
                            assigned to Queens Boulevard for speeding violations. As he opened his
                            newspaper, he heard over the radio about a small plane that hit the WTC
                            and he waited for further direction. He was directed to return to the
                            station and partner up. Not knowing what to expect, Anthony and his
                            partner grabbed shotguns and ammunition before heading downtown. As they
                            approached the midtown tunnel, they could see the towers on fire and
                            smoke filling the sky. At the site, Anthony was assigned to be an
                            escort. He had just returned from escorting nurses to the side when the
                            first tower fell. He and his partner ran. He recalls the tower falling
                            sounded like a freight train magnified by 5,000 and from here his memory
                            is a blur. Throughout the day, he remembers setting up a command post,
                            evacuating from a gas main break, searching for radios, and more
                            escorts. Altogether, Anthony worked a little over 200 hours between the
                            morgue and escorts of important persons, workers, and the families of
                            deceased police officers. He really began to feel the weight of the
                            event when escorting the families. The excitement of his first child
                            brought some positive but for the most part he ran on auto-pilot with
                            little time to cope. In December of 2001, he was called in for a small
                            village police job on Long Island and as he settled in he began to feel
                            off but attributed the feeling to the change of environment. He noticed
                            his health decline gradually until after an incident in February of 2007
                            when he was forced to retire. Now Anthony and his wife, Wendy, are
                            working to get him better and as a family, understand what PTSD is and
                            what it does to responders. They both agree there is still a lot of
                            healing ahead of them. Anthony says responders are a different breed and
                            if asked to respond again, he would do it in a heartbeat.

       Glen worked as a NYPD officer in the Emergency Medical Services unit on
                            9/11/2001. He worked in the S.W.A.T /Rescue unit for 109 Precinct in
                            Flushing, Queens. Glen states, “We were the guys police officers called
                            when they needed help.” Glen was at home when he got a call from a
                            friend who told him one of the towers was hit by a plane. He initially
                            thought his friend was playing a prank on him. He turned on the T.V. and
                            saw the damage. He prepared to rush to work, taking a direct route on
                            the Long Island Northern State Parkway to his precinct in Flushing,
                            Queens. He states he was driving “about a 100 miles an hour” when he saw
                            a police officer telling him to pull over. To save time, Glen flashed
                            his badge at the police officer and the officer, who had probably heard
                            the news, gave him a direct escort into Queens. At the precinct, he and
                            his fellow officers loaded up their vehicles in about 15 minutes,
                            forming a caravan of about six vehicles, and drove along Northern
                            Boulevard into the city. He recalls, “People were actually stepping out
                            from the middle of the street and clapping for us, which was really
                            nice.” The second tower had already collapsed when they entered
                            Manhattan. Near the site, he recalls seeing an injured police officer
                            who was “choking from inhaling all that garbage” (dust &amp; debris). He
                            and his team treated the officer with oxygen and eventually got him into
                            an ambulance. He remembers it took him a long time to connect with his
                            supervisor because of the amount of traffic or “static” on the radio.
                            His supervisor later told them that they lost two teams of about seven
                            people in the collapse of the towers. On 9/11, his main duties were
                            search and rescue around the perimeter of Ground Zero. He states, “I
                            remember finding a foot still in a shoe […] but not much more.” Later,
                            they formed teams to find their vehicles that were not covered with
                            dust, in order to recover larger weapons and more special equipment. He
                            was at Ground Zero till 2 a.m. on 9/12/2001. Glen continued working at
                            Ground Zero from 9/11/2001 to early January 2002. He was put on 16 hour
                            tours, 7 days a week doing recovery work. He remembers taking breaks in
                            temporary headquarters located at Stuyvesant High School off of Chambers
                            and West Street. He remembers one day the E.P.A. did an air quality
                            check in the area and said the air quality was “Ok.” However, Glen
                            states, “I knew the air quality wasn’t good […] I didn’t know it was as
                            toxic as it turned out to be.” He states, “We inhaled and ate
                            contaminated air.” He remembers eating from a buffet with open trays of
                            food and responders forming a line and taking a spoonful of whatever
                            they wanted to eat. He recalls that they had extra socks, underwear and
                            boots, eyewash stations and medical teams to treat small wounds. During
                            his work he states, “We bagged what we thought were body parts, bone
                            fragments, pieces of skin covered with dust […] it got to the point
                            where if you found a bone or piece of flesh you were happy because you
                            knew that they would test it with DNA and the family member of the
                            victim would have a little closure.” Glen particularly felt the loss of
                            his fellow officers after 9/11. He describes, “To me it was like someone
                            coming in and wiping out my family […] I took it really, really hard.
                            "Glen recalls that while working long hours at Ground Zero he did not
                            get to see his kids quite as much. Glen retired from the NYPD in 2003.
                            He missed the camaraderie from the police force, and describes his
                            struggles with PTSD. He mentions this had an impact on his family until
                            he sought help from counseling. He is thankful for the WTC program and
                            the help it offers him.

                            call on the morning of September 11th, 2001 wasn’t too unusual until
                            they left the subway a saw the plane sticking out of one of the towers.
                            They quickly confirmed the incident and went to evacuate people from the
                            area. Before the second plane hit, an FBI agent said to Carol “You’re
                            not cowards if you want to leave, there are more planes coming… You’re
                            going to die if you stay here.” Carol responded saying they would not
                            leave; this was her job. Carol proceeded to help and when Tower 2 fell,
                            she was inside holding on for her life. After it fell, she heard the
                            voice of an NYPD traffic officer near her and together they crawled out
                            of the building. It was completely dark and eerily silent. At this point
                            and for years later Carol understand that the towers collapsed around
                            her. In January of 2003, Carol was awarded the Medal of Valor for her
                            efforts on September 11th, 2001. She did not want to accept this medal
                            because she felt defeated. She felt that what she did was not enough but
                            she was forced to go. The ceremony was held at the Winter Garden, right
                            next to the WTC site and when she looked up she remember what had
                            happened to her and finally realized she was caught in the collapse.
                            Carol did not return to do recovery work. She was put on light duty work
                            at her precinct on Canal Street and each day she left work, her car was
                            covered in an inch of dust. She blew out a rotator cuff, had back
                            damage, lung injuries and needed two both knees to be reconstructed. She
                            was forced to retire and she hurts every day. From this interview, Carol
                            hope people remember to live each day to if fullest and to remember why
                            there are so many security measures.

       Jon, a union ironworker with Local 361, and a group of about 60-80 others
                            arrived at the site on the morning of September 12th with their heavy
                            equipment. They received a police escort through the Battery Tunnel into
                            lower Manhattan. He recalls the first thing many of the ironworkers did
                            after reaching the end of the tunnel was say a prayer. Many of them had
                            never seen a disaster that was an act of war. Despite the police escort,
                            National Guardsmen would not allow them into the job site. But this was
                            a job meant for ironworkers so they pushed their way through, using the
                            heavy machinery to make a trail for other emergency equipment to make
                            their way up West Street. They quickly proved their worth using their
                            heavy equipment to move massive pieces of iron and concrete that the
                            bucket brigade could not move. At the site, Jon recalls the devastation,
                            sirens, jets, and most of all, the blow horns to warn the thousands of
                            responders about the potential for other buildings to fall. He also
                            remembers thinking, someone stuck in the pile won’t last long between
                            the fires and the firemen’s hoses water soaking the area. The first four
                            days, Jon was there as a volunteer with others from his job site in
                            Brooklyn which closed after the attacks. After four days the job
                            reopened, Jon and a few others continued to go down to the pile after
                            their shift until the morning when the returned to work for about a
                            month. He states that he and others were not there to get paid. They
                            were there to try to save lives. Jon blames the government and
                            administration for misleading the public about the hazards at the site
                            and for not having an emergency disaster plan despite the 1993 bombing
                            and the knowledge that an attack would happen again. He is very
                            discouraged by government. He recalls President Bush saying “We will not
                            forget”. But the government has forgotten about the responders’ health.
                            Jon has been disabled since August 4, 2004. He is a strong supporter of
                            unions and without the healthcare provided through the union and the WTC
                            medical monitoring program, he is not so sure he would be alive today.
                            He is no longer working as a result of his 9/11 related illnesses which
                            include PTSD and a 37% reduction in lung capacity. Jon may not be in the
                            best of heath but he would do it again.

       Donna worked as an Electrician for the Local 3 on 9-11-2001. She was one
                            of 50 women in the industry, and is a third-generation electrician. In
                            her 20 years as an electrician she has worked in major construction
                            sites in schools, tunnels, and on bridges. She worked as a fiber splicer
                            and was the first female forewoman at Ground Zero. On 9-11-2001, Donna
                            was at home watching the events on T.V. She knew she would try to go to
                            Ground Zero the next day. She said, “I knew it would be the worst
                            construction site I’d ever seen.” On 9-12-2001, she was working over the
                            59th St. Bridge and saw there was a bus with volunteer ironworkers
                            heading to Ground Zero. For insurance reasons, electricians had to be
                            “hired” in order to work at Ground Zero, however Donna managed to get on
                            the bus with her apprentice. She remembers carrying her vest and pocket
                            tools on the bus. She recalls that everyone was in a good frame of mind,
                            and that “there was standing room only” on the bus. She saw a lot of
                            chaos at the site. She mentions the lack of equipment, lack of
                            masks—they only had dust masks—but said, “At that moment, it was about
                            saving lives, not equipment.” Donna worked periodically for 24 days at
                            Ground Zero as a Fiber Splicer, and returned again in February 2002 in a
                            hired position. However she mentions her company S&amp;J didn’t like
                            women being down at the site. Donna mentions that she had some PTSD from
                            her experience at Ground Zero. In the future, she advises that people
                            should think about their families before volunteering for experiences
                            like that. (Donna recalls how her own family was upset that she went
                            down to the site). Donna found her job as an electrician very fulfilling
                            and is very proud of the things she has accomplished in life. She is now
                            a grandmother, and was present at this interview with her baby
                            granddaughter.

       On the morning of September 11th, Marion was at the Brooklyn Criminal
                            Court where she worked as a court officer. The court house was located
                            just across the river from the World Trade Center and in the building,
                            she could smell burning. Not long after she heard about the attacks from
                            a warrant officer’s radio. She was frightened and disoriented. With all
                            the knowledge and security we have in America, how did someone manage to
                            attack? She was directed to evacuate the court house and lock it down.
                            Marion went to the site on September 12th. She was astonished by what
                            she saw. She remembers thinking this is what war looks like; 360 degrees
                            of devastation. There she helped to unload supplies from incoming
                            trucks. She remembers the workers at the site were all numb and it was
                            eerily silent. Everyone pushed aside emotions to get their job done.
                            Adrenaline kept her going. At home, Marion was frightened but at work
                            she felt a sense of relief; it felt cathartic to be a part of the
                            solution. Marion has some health problems and she remembers believing
                            the president when he said we’ll take care of the responders but the
                            responders have been forgotten. She is still concerned that there is
                            another attack whenever she hears sirens. Marion hopes that people
                            remain vigilant and keep their eyes open for more terrorist
                            activity.

                            Association, which was involved with the Red Cross in caring for animals
                            in disaster situations (including devising plans to care for animals
                            whose owners couldn’t evacuate with them). When 9/11 happened, this
                            plan, called “Pet Safe” went into action on Long Island, but it turned
                            out not to be needed. Therefore, he turned his efforts to organizing
                            veterinarians from Long Island to go to the WTC sites and work with
                            Suffolk County Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).
                            Howard first went to the WTC site on the Thursday following 9/11, his
                            truck loaded with supplies, a portable x-ray machine, and an ultra-sound
                            machine. Some firefighters hitched a ride with him. His role at the site
                            was to organize the veterinarians who were assessing and treating the
                            search and rescue dogs. They worked out of the SCPA spay and neuter
                            truck and adjacent tents that were set up just inside the perimeter.
                            Howard describes the scenes in great detail, including the respite
                            center that was set up at Stuyvesant High School. He talked about the
                            important role played by massage therapists in helping relieve stress
                            and aches and pains; the work that the dogs were expected to do; and the
                            outreach extended to the dogs from people all over the states, who sent
                            things like knitted booties to protect their feet. He stated that the
                            handlers and their dogs came from all over (Michigan, Toronto, and Ohio,
                            to name a few) and had all arrived in NYC within the first few days. He
                            pointed out that all kinds of people came, even a Chippewa Native
                            American from Michigan (where Howard was originally from). They came
                            prepared, lived in their cars, had brought their own food and supplies.
                            Howard discussed the dangerous work environment, emphasizing the dust
                            and soot. However, prior to responding, he had contemplated the danger
                            and rationalized that he was over 50 and lived most of his life, so was
                            willing to accept the consequences. He felt that everyone there was
                            cognizant of the dangers but were helping regardless. The challenges he
                            confronted were personnel issues and coordinating veterinarians who were
                            used to running their own practices. One of his biggest jobs was making
                            sure that everyone followed protocol, including wearing the protective
                            equipment. He acknowledged that by the time the respirators came, the
                            responders already had a lot of exposure to the dust and he admits that
                            his ongoing cough may be the result of this exposure. Howard reported
                            that he wasn’t exposed to the emotional trauma that many responders were
                            and that his interactions with other responders were positive. He states
                            he has a new respect for firefighters and for former NYC mayor Rudolph
                            Giuliani. Overall, he feels fortunate to have been able to help and work
                            with so many who wanted to be down there. He described, with a lot of
                            emotion, the support from ordinary people and the countless crowds who
                            applauded the responders near the site. Even 10 years later, he is
                            overwhelmed by the gratitude shown for the responders by the community.

       Glenn, a Nassau Marine officer, remembers the picture perfect morning of
                            September 11th, 2001. At work he heard about the first plane and thought
                            it was an accident but when he heard about the second plane, he knew it
                            was an attack. He and the other Marine officers were called in to
                            respond. They established themselves at North Cove Marina located at the
                            base of Battery Park. Glenn remembers seeing a police officer, with a
                            bandana over his mouth, calming a crowd of panicked people waiting for a
                            boat to transport them to safety. This image is one of the few positives
                            he is able to pull away. They spent the day filling the boats with
                            people and transporting them across the river. On the boats they would
                            document the people they were transporting and attempt to contact their
                            families to let them know the person was safe. After there were no more
                            people to transport they started to transport supplies or would work on
                            the pile. On the pile, Glenn questioned where are the computers, phones,
                            and desks? Paper was the sole survivor. This experience strongly
                            impacted Glenn’s family and he can’t go a day without thinking about it.
                            It is hard to heal from and he just can’t forget. Glenn received federal
                            recognition when he received the highest civilian award from the
                            Department of Transportations for his supportive role on and after
                            September 11th.

       Jack was the director of EMS for New York Presbyterian Hospital. On 9/11,
                            he arrived early at work, as was part of his regular routine, convened a
                            staff huddle, and returned to his office to check emails. He was soon
                            notified by the dispatcher at the communication center about the first
                            plane crashing into the WTC. He responded immediately, trying to gather
                            information. The hospital began preparing for mass casualties and Jack
                            began prepping his units for a disaster response. However, things
                            quickly changed when Jack’s unit were told to respond down at the site.
                            Having arrived just after the second plane hit, Jack led his team to an
                            area where he thought they could safely set up. But the building was
                            about to collapse: “Run for your life!” Large pieces of steel came down
                            as they ran. A woman running beside him was decapitated. He was able to
                            dive under stairs of an overpass and he laid there with his some of his
                            staff while the debris showered down. For a moment, he believed he was
                            dying; his pulse in the low 40s and he was not able to breathe. He just
                            felt numb. After lifting his head above the concrete dust, he was able
                            to get a breath. Jack crawled into an open area and found one of his
                            men. By the time the 2nd tower collapsed, they had found shelter in a
                            nearby bank building. He felt compelled to go back for his staff, who
                            had been scattered, but he wanted to account for each one. Located his
                            23 staff members, 13 of whom, including himself, were taken by skiff to
                            Liberty Park, New Jersey for triage. He returned to the site and was put
                            in charge of a section by the fire chief, but his injuries forced him to
                            leave the pile and go to the hospital. Insistent on returning to work,
                            Jack was released and began contacting the families of two of his men
                            who were missing and he believed were possibly dead. His story goes into
                            detail about the personal difficulty in notifying the families of the
                            deceased and dealing with staff who didn’t want to give up hope. He
                            describes the loss of their families and differences in how people dealt
                            with the tragedy. In addition, he underlined the importance of community
                            and camaraderie and the impact of death on the entire “family” unit.
                            Other topics he discussed include finding closure for families of those
                            who perished; the role of the government; and informing the workers
                            about the air quality at Ground Zero. This topic in particular is what
                            he thinks about daily as he reflects on 9/11 and what we should learn
                            from it.

       Richard is an NYPD detective in the forensics division. He lives on Long
                            Island with his family. On the morning of September 11th he received a
                            call from his brother, also an NYPD officer, alerting him of the
                            attacks. As he watched the T.V., he quickly suspected terrorism and
                            began to think of how difficult it would be for the fire fighters to
                            contain the fires. He did not think the towers would collapse. Shortly
                            after he was called into his command post and eventually to the site.
                            The fire burning at the site reminded Richard of a volcano. It was very
                            loud and very chaotic. NYPD’s resources were maxed out and each officer
                            was doing several jobs at once. He split his time between the bucket
                            brigade and helping civilians. Altogether, Richard spent about six
                            months at the site. He felt it was important to do his part. Richard
                            lost a friend of his in the Emergency Service Unit and several work
                            acquaintances. He attended several funerals and although he only knew
                            the people casually, he could strongly relate to them and sympathize
                            with their families. From this experience, Richard really counts his
                            blessings. He takes the time to express how to his family how much he
                            loves them. He is proud to be an American and holds on the spirit of
                            those coming together to help during tragedy. He questions what is
                            really important in life and what will bring him happiness. But he also
                            questions what created so much hatred in the terrorists. The hatred is
                            not temporary and until we change it or understand it, terrorism is
                            still a threat.

       Bill was a corrections officer in Nassau County. He lived on Long Island
                            with his wife and 5 year old son. He had the day off on 9/11 and was
                            home going about his business until a friend called and told him to turn
                            on the TV. As the events unfolded before his eyes, he stared at the
                            television in shock. He was overcome by feelings of confusion and fear.
                            He and his wife went into a sort of survival mode to prepare for the
                            worst. He loaded his gun, went to the grocery store to stock up on
                            food…there was a great feeling of uncertainty about what the future
                            held. Two days later, he was one of many county officials who went into
                            the city with the local Red Cross and Salvation Army to bring supplies.
                            He describes the numbing he felt as he first witnessed the destruction
                            at Ground Zero. There was no time to process the level of destruction.
                            Bill was immediately assigned to provide security at a FDNY firehouse,
                            Rescue 1, near Ground Zero. The Rescue 1 firefighters had been deployed
                            to the WTC Center buildings soon after the first plane hit and now many
                            were missing. Bill and his fellow officers pulled up to the firehouse
                            and were greeted warmly by the firefighters’ spouses, who welcomed them
                            and fed them. Bill shares some poignant stories of generosity and
                            courage displayed by these women, who focused on keeping the community
                            together, despite none knew if their husbands had survived. In true NYC
                            fashion, where the firehouse is central to the community, neighbors
                            began bringing flowers, signs, food and even donating money. One woman
                            brought her paycheck, stating she wanted to donate it to the firemen.
                            Bill recalled these events with great emotion and expresses that he felt
                            guilty for being the receiver of support from the community (hugs, words
                            of thanks). Beneath the brave exterior there was so much hurt and
                            turmoil. One wife broke down and begged him to bring her to the site so
                            she could dig with her hands, anything to find her husband. Eventually,
                            he was no longer needed at the firehouse and volunteered to work at the
                            Bereavement Center at Chelsea Pier. He describes the methodical way that
                            families were processed. They brought brown lunch bags with items
                            containing DNA of their lost loved one and went through a series of
                            stations, eventually leaving with the same message: it was unlikely
                            their family member survived. He felt very numb to everything at this
                            point, but recalls returning home at a 15-hour shift and watching his
                            son, asleep, thinking how lucky he was. Despite his wife’s concern over
                            his safety, he continued to volunteer and felt that he had to be there.
                            Bill feels strongly that Ground Zero is hallowed ground and expressed
                            that the site needs to be preserved. Today, he feels he is still chasing
                            the post-9/11 feeling, when the country came together—complete strangers
                            united in charity and giving. In his words, it was a time when people
                            were kinder to each other. There was so much destruction and so many
                            funerals, but it is this positivity and sense of community that he holds
                            onto. And yet, a sense of guilt stays with him. He often reflects on
                            9/11 and although time has moved on, he hasn’t. The memory is always
                            there.

       On 9/11 Joseph worked for the Board of Education in the school safety
                            division of the NYPD. His job was to provide school security for a
                            school in Flushing, Queens. On the day of the attacks, he was told about
                            it from a coworker and viewed it from the roof of the school in Queens.
                            He called his supervisor and was instructed to evacuate the school. He
                            was stunned. He says, “I thought it was a dream.” People were crying and
                            a few fainted. He stayed at work to secure the building till around 7 or
                            8 PM that night and went home to watch the events on TV. Both Joseph and
                            his partner went to Ground Zero the first week in October as
                            volunteers—he went as often as he could—after work and on days off. He
                            worked 12-hour shifts on weekends. On his first day at the site, he said
                            it looked way different than on TV, more like a “movie set.” He was
                            assigned to one area on the pile doing search and recovery. He described
                            it as tough work and felt he was not prepared. The most difficult part
                            was finding body parts, and he recalls getting upset when he came across
                            a baby stroller. He said it was scary and strenuous working on the
                            rubble. He smelled dead bodies, burning plastic, paper, and metal. His
                            main motivation for working at the site was to help family members of
                            deceased victims. The event opened up his eyes and he is now always
                            aware of his surroundings. It has changed his life dramatically and he
                            now lives life to the fullest. Joseph stopped participating in his
                            family, which he said affected them negatively. He does not consider
                            himself a hero and would do it again because he just wants to help. He
                            feels he has been taken care of very well and hopes the Zadroga Bill
                            passes, and that people never forget.

       William was working as an NYPD officer in the Emergency Services Unit on
                            9-11-2001. He was the 13th member in his family to serve as a police
                            officer. He saw the planes hit the Twin Towers on T.V., and went to his
                            Brooklyn police station to check in. William and his fellow E.S.U.
                            officers commandeered a city bus into the city through the Battery
                            Tunnel. William worked at the site until about 3:30 in the afternoon of
                            9-11-2001. At Ground Zero, he worked in rescue &amp; recovery, and
                            helped rescue Officer John McLoughlin, who was trapped in the debris. He
                            recalls being aware that other buildings such as hotels and banks near
                            Ground Zero could have fallen due to the aftershock of the Twin Tower
                            collapse, and there were people with whistles nearby to warn responders
                            in case these buildings crumbled. William mentions there were fighter
                            planes flying overhead to respond to any other plane attacks that day.
                            After his first shift, he went home to wash up and recalls, “My hair was
                            so matted with this crap (dust), it was in (my) eyes and ears.” He
                            continued to work on the site until January 2002. His days at the site
                            were spent teaming up with fellow officers, being assigned a “grid” to
                            work in the WTC site for about 4-5 hours. During breaks, they ate under
                            a Red Cross tent in the open air. William recalls that dust was all over
                            the food they ate, and on their clothes. He remembers that their cars
                            were washed so that they wouldn’t “contaminate” the city after work, but
                            their clothes were still covered with the dust. He believes nobody had
                            any regrets about going there, but sometimes he said, “You got burnt
                            out, guys turned on each other (but) you just got to keep going.”
                            William said he does not want to see footage of the 9-11-2001 WTC
                            attacks. He lost 13 fellow officers in the E.S.U. on that day. William
                            has seen numerous dangerous activities in his 16 years in the E.S.U such
                            as shootouts, stabbings, and suicides, and the Far Rockaway plane crash,
                            but said 9-11-2001 was the “coup de grace.” William retired from NYPD in
                            2006, and now works as a park ranger. He believes from prior experience
                            in the Intelligence unit that the United States should still be vigilant
                            for underground terrorist activities.

                            After his first shift, he went home to wash up and recalls, “My hair was
                            so matted with this crap (dust), it was in (my) eyes and ears.” He
                            continued to work on the site until January 2002. His days at the site
                            were spent teaming up with fellow officers, being assigned a “grid” to
                            work in the WTC site for about 4-5 hours. During breaks, they ate under
                            a Red Cross tent in the open air. William recalls that dust was all over
                            the food they ate, and on their clothes. He remembers that their cars
                            were washed so that they wouldn’t “contaminate” the city after work, but
                            their clothes were still covered with the dust. He believes nobody had
                            any regrets about going there, but sometimes he said, “You got burnt
                            out, guys turned on each other (but) you just got to keep going.”
                            William said he does not want to see footage of the 9-11-2001 WTC
                            attacks. He lost 13 fellow officers in the E.S.U. on that day. William
                            has seen numerous dangerous activities in his 16 years in the E.S.U such
                            as shootouts, stabbings, and suicides, and the Far Rockaway plane crash,
                            but said 9-11-2001 was the “coup de grace.” William retired from NYPD in
                            2006, and now works as a park ranger. He believes from prior experience
                            in the Intelligence unit that the United States should still be vigilant
                            for underground terrorist activities.

       Kenneth is a landscape contractor who lives in the East
                            Northport/Huntington area on Long Island. He’s married with three
                            daughters. On 9/11, he was at home cleaning his garage. His wife alerted
                            him to the plane crash and they watched the events unfold on TV as they
                            continued to work. It didn’t occur to him that the buildings could ever
                            fall. Kenneth first arrived at the WTC site on the evening of 9/12.
                            Another contractor had asked him to come and help survey the situation;
                            he wasn’t intending to work there. It was dark, and he describes it as
                            “mind-boggling.” They had been escorted from Nassau County to the Javits
                            Center, and from there they were able to go down to Ground Zero. When
                            Kenneth turned the corner into the area, there were large machines
                            pulling debris from the pile and firemen with tools roaming in packs.
                            “They were numb, and you were about to become numb.” He noticed there
                            didn’t seem to be any restrictions; there was freedom to walk around.
                            Kenneth remembers walking through the American Express building, which
                            was still standing but “trashed,” in total darkness to reach the pile.
                            There was a burnt escalator by Building 5 that people were walking up
                            (it wasn’t running). He went up as well, when he heard someone scream,
                            “It’s going! It’s going!” and they thought it was caving in, so all the
                            people on this escalator stampeded to get off. This was when he realized
                            the true danger he was in. On Thursday, he took a front-end loader and
                            joined a convoy that was escorted back into the city along with a
                            demolition expert (the man who had first asked him to come in). Kenneth
                            was there for about two weeks. He was assigned with his payloader at
                            Building 7. He first worked Thursday evening through Friday, and was
                            relieved on Saturday, when the city started to make the site more secure
                            and started sending people home for rest. On his second night there, an
                            I-beam rolled onto the foot of a man he was working with—their
                            supervisor called for help via walkie-talkie and he was taken very
                            quickly to an ambulance headed for Bellevue. Kenneth remembers seeing
                            people pushing wheelbarrows filled with ice and drinks, others handing
                            out hot dogs, others asking if they needed water or anything
                            else—seemingly civilians who just wanted to be there to help. He also
                            mentioned the Salvation Army and their willingness to get the responders
                            what they wanted or needed. At Church and Vesey, there was a half-block
                            of donated materials piled up, from boots to gloves, to bottled water
                            and more. From the very first day, there were people standing along the
                            highway and street corners, cheering and holding up signs for the
                            responders, which was really meaningful. The equipment needed to really
                            do the job was “days and months” from being provided, so great was the
                            magnitude. Kenneth’s interviews gives some insight into the details of
                            the work construction/heavy machinery workers did at the site. He also
                            mentioned the working dogs; the area might shut down for two or three
                            hours if the dog smelled something. Working at night was much harder
                            psychologically. It was easier to be there during the day. He’ll always
                            remember the image of the bucket trucks at night, spraying water down
                            onto the burning pile—he couldn’t even see the firemen through the thick
                            smoke. When Kenneth was leaving, he saw the large scale demolition
                            equipment arriving, which signaled to him that this was definitively
                            turning into a recovery mission. Although he was ultimately paid,
                            Kenneth didn’t do this for the money, and talk of pay wasn’t brought up
                            until later. “To me, it was a freebie.” Kenneth’s family checked in via
                            phone daily when he was working at the site. He shared photos with them.
                            He doesn’t think they worried, because they didn’t know what it was like
                            to be there. While he was working there, he generally went home only to
                            sleep. He was often asked if he found anyone, and he would have to
                            explain the reality. Kenneth rarely thinks about his experience now. He
                            doesn’t feel upset, and isn’t remorseful. He doesn’t volunteer for many
                            things, but seeing “how people can take care of people” made him feel
                            good. Kenneth dislikes that civilians are rarely mentioned in the rescue
                            and recovery efforts. Kenneth does feel that the government has become
                            too involved in its citizens’ lives: “We’re not going in the right
                            direction.”

       Mike proudly states that he has never missed a day of work as a union
                            ironworker. By 9 AM on September 11th, he was watching TV on his coffee
                            break when he hear about the attacks and noticed the sirens throughout
                            the city. The foreman of the job site instructed everyone to wrap up and
                            head home. That night Mike received a call from a co-worker at ground
                            zero who heard Mayor Giuliani’s request for the help of ironworkers.
                            After watching the events unfold on TV throughout the day, he did not
                            know what to expect but headed in to help. Mike described the site as
                            dark and smoky. He noticed several people forming groups and attempting
                            to organize the chaos. He helped by using a torch to burn steal. At one
                            point in the night he helped some firefighters to get cameras through
                            rubble searching people who were trapped. This is where he found a
                            victim sitting upright in the rubble. The man had a wedding band on and
                            Mike couldn’t help but think about the man’s life and family. This
                            experience was like no other work experience for Mike. He says it is
                            embarrassing nearly a decade later we still haven’t rebuild and Bin
                            Laden is still out there. But as a country, this event has made us
                            stronger and more cautious. Mike tries to remember the positives, like
                            how so many people teamed up together.

       John, a police sergeant for Nassau County, was working at the Far
                            Rockaway Marina on September 11th. After hearing about the attacks he
                            knew it was terrorism; two planes is no accident. Not knowing what to
                            expect, he quickly organized crews to supply and board four police
                            boats. They left the respirators behind. John says that if he could have
                            seen into the future he would have grabbed them. Around noon, they
                            docked at North Cove Marina which pulls up just next to the World Trade
                            Center. Vehicles had limited access because of the amount of debris. The
                            boats had an advantage. For three days they transported injured people
                            and fatigued workers to be triaged across the river in New Jersey. From
                            New Jersey they picked up supplies and brought it back to Manhattan.
                            They collected phone numbers and names of those they were transporting
                            to quickly call their families and let them know their loved ones are
                            okay. On breaks they either napped or worked on the bucket brigade. John
                            kept himself motivated by hoping every day they would save someone from
                            the wreckage. He would wake up and tell himself “today’s the day I am
                            going to pull someone out,” but this never happened. Since 9/11, John’s
                            health has worsened. He is winded after getting up to answer the phone.
                            If this happened again, physically, he would not be able to do it but he
                            would find some other way to help. John wants people to remember that
                            those who responded were selfless. He also wants people to remember the
                            patriotism that followed the attacks. Although it was short-lived, we
                            are one country that stuck together through tragedy.

                            9/11/2001. When the attacks occurred all the communications in the Lower
                            Manhattan area were wiped out. Steven volunteered to go to the WTC site
                            to fix the communication systems. He got the system up and running by
                            overseeing the installation of new telephone cables from point A to
                            point B. He was also responsible for managing machines that pumped
                            compressed air into the cables –which kept them dry and in good
                            operating condition. He worked 15 hour shifts at the site for 15 days
                            after 9/11/2001. Steven particularly remembers the efforts of
                            firefighters, and says of them, “I felt like I was in the presence of
                            true heroes.” He recalls how, “Every once in a while they would blow a
                            horn, everybody would stop working and all the firemen and police
                            officers would all line up…they would remove a police officer or
                            fireman’s (body) and drape an American flag over the stretcher and take
                            it to the morgue.” He recalls an atmosphere of camaraderie, charity, and
                            patriotism in New York City after 9/11, and was compelled to keep a
                            journal as evidence to this spirit. In his interview, Steven recites a
                            few famous lines from Walt Whitman’s “City of the World”, which he found
                            inscribed into a railing by the WTC site: City of the world! For all
                            races are here/All the lands of the earth make contributions here./Proud
                            and passionate city--mettlesome, mad, extravagant city!/Spring up O
                            city--not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself, warlike!" Steven was
                            born and raised in Manhattan. He is retired from the telephone company
                            and now works as a part-time security guard for a local Long Island high
                            school. He says hopes that 9/11 is a day that “people never forget.”

       In 2001, Jonathan was a very health man living on 32nd Street in
                            Manhattan. He own a successful sub-contracting business downtown and
                            most of his work was in Battery City. On his way to work on September
                            11th, he noticed the flames on the top of tower one and thought the air
                            conditioner caught fire. From his office window, he could see the second
                            plane flying low and headed north. He did not see it hit the second
                            tower but he felt it. Initially, he thought the fire he noticed driving
                            into work interfered with the air traffic control and caused the second
                            plan to go off route and into the tower. Shortly after, he heard over a
                            Nextel radio that it was actually an attack. Motivated to help, Jonathan
                            headed to the WTC and along the way helped to direct some lost firemen.
                            As others were running away from the towers, Jonathan the firemen were
                            the only people running towards the towers. He was just north of the
                            buildings when the first one collapsed and following the collapse was an
                            eerie silence. He walked away with just a few lacerations. Jonathan
                            spend about three hundred hours at the site doing whatever he saw was
                            needed. The first victim Jonathan came across was a woman holding a
                            Matchbox racecar with the number 43 on it. He held on to it knowing that
                            this must have had some significance to the woman for her to be
                            clutching it just before she died. He felt attached to the car marked
                            with the number 43 because there were 343 firemen who died on 9/11 and
                            although he was not a fireman, he felt connected to the brotherhood at
                            Ground Zero. With some encouragement on the year anniversary, he gave
                            away the car and the story to put on display. Jonathan hopes that the
                            family and friends of victims realize that the responders selflessly did
                            everything they possibly could have done. He responded not because he
                            knew someone in the building but because he was hopeful that he could
                            help a stranger.

       September 11th destroyed Mark both physically and emotionally. Prior to
                            the event he was engaged, ready to start a family, and working as a
                            Ballistic and Integrity specialist with NYPD. He was responsible for
                            testing officer’s equipment to ensure their safety. Now, nearly ten
                            years later, he is single, living with his parents, and disabled. He
                            suffers from PTSD, severe depression, obstructive lung disease,
                            migraines and more all as a result of his time at ground zero. Although
                            he doesn’t remember much, Mark knows he was caught in the collapse and
                            recalls the dust and confusion. He worked at the site for 6 months
                            primarily transporting fuel and diesel to other agencies. A few days
                            after the event, he remembers hearing what sounded like gun shots. He is
                            bothered by the fact that he will never know if this sound was the fire
                            getting to the bullets hidden in the debris or if it was trapped
                            officers giving up. Mark was uneasy about the thoughts and feelings he
                            was having so he began to self-medicate with alcohol. He lost his fiancé
                            and friends because he is not emotionally available to others. Around
                            anniversaries he is self-destructive and his family worries. His only
                            solace is martial arts. Although he is physically unable to do most
                            things, he says his dojo instructor is helpful. His instructor listens
                            to him and is able to calm him down. Mark feels the government is doing
                            a good job at preventing other incidents from happening. But Mark hopes
                            people don’t forget the responders dying every day from their exposure
                            at 9/11 or the soldiers who stepped up after the attacks.

       Gaddy was very disturbed about his time spent at Ground Zero. He still
                            wears a rock that was found embedded in Verizon equipment around his
                            neck. He mentioned his late grandfather's last words: "Never forget
                            Pearl Harbor" and he feels same about Ground Zero. He feels as though
                            9/11 could have been avoided, had the government paid more attention.

                            worked nights in the South Tower before attack. After 9/11 he moved to a
                            building on West Street (near Ground Zero) until his retirement 3 years

                            responders digging at the site. He says responding to 9/11 was "part of
                            my job." Kelly is now retired from NYPD.

       Michael worked in Brooklyn as a NYPD Homicide Detective on 9/11/2001. He
                            in Bedford-Stuyvesant saw the towers fall from a housing project. He and
                            his partners cleared a busy intersection by the LIRR Flatbush and
                            Atlantic Avenue station to let EMS personnel through. He describes
                            seeing a flood of commuters cross over the Brooklyn Bridge to make their
                            way home. On the evening of 9/11 he went to the WTC site. He worked 12
                            hour tours clearing the site plus his regular job as a homicide
                            detective which made it seem like a "20 hour day." After Ground Zero

                            at the Staten Island Fresh Kills landfill raking through debris dumped
                            by pay loaders to recover body parts and personal effects. He describes
                            seeing people who lost their loved ones standing outside the landfill
                            hoping to find their personal effects. He also lost a neighborhood
                            firefighter "Mattie" in the towers.

       Robert worked as a Verizon Field Technician on 9/11/2001. He worked under
                            rubble in manholes checking wires at Ground Zero. He was factual and
                            seemed happy that he was able to help. He was impressed by the teamwork,
                            patriotism, and camaraderie he witnessed. He is retired now but would go
                            again if a similar catastrophe occurred.

       Gerard worked as a union laborer for Local 1175 on 9/11/2001. He is
                            originally from Brooklyn and grew up across the river from WTC. Many of
                            his family members worked on WTC building and docks. He felt as if he
                            "had to go" and volunteered. He said Ground Zero was like "heaven and
                            hell at the same time." Said "little angels" were everywhere offering
                            food, drinks etc. The experience has changed his life in a positive
                            direction--he became more involved in his daughter's life. He said he
                            drove around for a year with equipment (respirator, etc.) in his car, so
                            in case of another attack he would be ready. He cried every night on his
                            way home from work, when he looked in rear view mirror and saw the
                            buildings gone. Gerard wishes the recovery effort had been done more
                            slowly and safely, and that the government had been more honest about
                            the air quality.

       Michael was working as a NYPD officer patrolling Canal Street to the
                            South Ferry areas with his rookie partner, Eric. He was in the bottom of
                            the North Tower when he heard a “big bang” and the building shook. He
                            first thought it might be the wind, but then he saw dust and debris
                            falling along with a man fall from above and hit the concrete. His arms
                            kept “flapping like a duck” before he stopped moving. He saw firemen
                            from Beekman Street Engine Company 6, who were friends of his, climb the
                            stairs to rescue people. None of them came back alive. He still has
                            trouble visiting the Company Six firehouse. Michael was given the
                            responsibility of evacuating the people out of the North Tower, away
                            from the WTC area and into the subways. He sustained some injuries and
                            was treated at St. Vincent’s hospital. As these were on the job
                            injuries, he was relieved of duty for some time. He later returned to
                            the site with his partner to give relief and deliver food to the men and
                            women who were working at Ground Zero. Michael is unhappy with the way
                            the NYPD treated his case. The NYPD sergeants lacked the skills to
                            emotionally care for their officers after the attack. They have also
                            refused to give him disability for his emotional state after going
                            through the horrible experiences of this attack.

       Christine worked for NYPD on 9/11/2001. She arrived at Ground Zero at 4
                            a.m. on 9/12/2001 after spending 8 hours on a "war bus" on September
                            11th. The first thing she did was pull a body from the rubble. She then
                            found another body embedded in the rebar (metal supports inside concrete
                            slabs used for building). She describes finding what she thought was a
                            pocketbook, but as she lifted it up she saw it was part of a burnt human
                            head. She entered the site for the first time with other policemen and
                            was frightened by those leaving the scene--the "empty" look in the eyes
                            of the fireman and cops, and the "crazy" atmosphere. She said she hopes
                            to never see large groups of men cry like that again. She explained that
                            police officers do not cry and they had to make "hiding places" in the
                            rubble so that they could cry unobserved. After many hours working on
                            the pile, she went in search of food with a rookie police officer. She
                            found food, water, and juice in various places and found a seat from a
                            police van. She loaded the goods onto the seat and she and her coworker
                            carried the seat back to the other policemen. A captain and her sergeant
                            saw them approach carrying the seat. She said police officers never
                            approach a captain, but there was no rank at Ground Zero--everyone was
                            the same. She walked right up to them and they congratulated her on her
                            work. For most of her career, Christine worked in Jamaica, Queens where
                            the neighborhood was at odds with the police force. Everything changed
                            after 9/11: people brought food and letters from children to the
                            precinct, and then the responders exited the bus one day, all traffic
                            stopped and people got out of their cars and clapped. Christine said she
                            can now relate to her parents, who were "World War II heroes." He mother
                            was a nurse and her father worked for the Coast Guard, driving a landing
                            craft that drove General McArthur ashore. She said she grew up with
                            parents who were prepared for any emergency and she has become the same
                            way. Christine lost a sergeant and two other friends at the WTC and said
                            you could "never understand unless you were standing in the middle of
                            chaos." Her best friend's brother, who attended a breakfast once a year
                            a the WTC, was killed. She hopes people remember how bad it was. People
                            who she hadn't heard from in many years left messages on her phone to
                            see if she was okay and others asked if she could find their loved ones
                            for them. She did not know how to explain that no one there was alive.
                            The experience changed her into a "crier" and she is now a little
                            "jumpy." She said the response of the NYPD and FDNY and whole country
                            was so motivating; the incredible thoughtfulness kept her going. She
                            feels the NYPD is now much more prepared and is very proud of America's
                            response to the tragedy.

       Louis was a NYPD Homicide detective on 9/11/2001. He arrived on the
                            evening of 9/11 at Ground Zero. He said it seemed worse the next day
                            when he saw it in the daylight and that the ash was "ankle deep." He
                            spent most of his time working at the morgue, opening body bags to
                            identify victims and check for identification such as a license, etc. If
                            a body was intact, he sent it for fingerprints and x-rays. Louis was
                            happy when he could identify a body for a family and was glad to help in
                            order to get the job done. Since Louis was a homicide detective for 32
                            years in Brooklyn, he saw many murders and was accustomed to seeing dead
                            bodies. He would do it again if he was able. He saw half of a face
                            locked in a frozen scream and compared it with the painting of Edward
                            Munch. He saw a fireman that was baked in his suit, whose skin was
                            "cooked." He saw a man with his arms through his stomach and said he was
                            like a "pretzel." He lost a close friend named Brian at Ground Zero and
                            spent time looking for his remains. He was never found. He said in the
                            beginning of the clean up, the body bags were large and became smaller
                            as time went on, and smaller pieces of bodies were found. After his work
                            at the morgue, he worked at the landfill, which he said was eerie
                            because of the stacks of burnt fire and police vehicles. The ground at
                            the landfill bubbled and smoked, and he sifted through the debris with a
                            rake to find body parts and bones. He said the sunsets a the landfill
                            were beautiful. Louis experiences flashbacks when he smells concrete and
                            is unhappy with the current government. He feels another attack will
                            happen again---it is just a matter of time. He believes Americans have
                            become too complacent and they will never understand. The only way you
                            understand was to "open up a bag."

       Hanson was a teacher for the Department of Transportation; he instructed
                            students to drive heavy equipment. Hanson arrived at Ground Zero on
                            9/11/01 and spoke of a conflict between the Long Island Department of
                            Transportation and the NYC Department of Transportation. He said the
                            conflict was resolved fairly quickly as each department set up their own
                            command post. He did not go home for three days and did not sleep for
                            two nights. He was in charge of nine pieces of equipment (cranes,
                            payloaders and state vehicles) and eight tractor trailers. Hanson did
                            not work on the pile; he checked the identification of heavy equipment
                            operators entering the site. He was previously trained for about six
                            months for Y2K and said that the training help him a great deal with the
                            9/11 disaster. At the time he was at Ground Zero, his son, who was in
                            the military, was at the Pentagon counseling family members. Hanson
                            quickly developed some medical issues, sneezing, coughing and itching
                            around the ankles but said it has since improved. He did not sleep well
                            for a few months, but is happy he was able to help and would do it
                            again. He did have a cousin who died at the WTC, but they were not
                            close. He felt the Salvation Army and the Red Cross did an amazing job
                            and kept everyone going with food, water, etc. He said the American
                            people did a “great job.”

       Rafael was working as a NYPD detective in Brooklyn on 9/11/2001. He also
                            owned a vending machine business in the WTC area. He starts off his
                            interview by mentioning that the day before 9/11 he was at the South
                            Street Seaport with his son, who wanted to visit the World Trade Center.
                            He recalls seeing “ominous” clouds over the WTC towers. On 9/11, Mr.
                            Orozco was assigned to work with fellow detective Phil and saw the first
                            plane hit the tower as their police van was being serviced at a Brooklyn
                            car wash. He said, “It seemed as if the plane was going in slow motion.”
                            His first thought was that this was an act of terrorism. He and his
                            partner reported to their Brooklyn North central communications post,
                            where they changed into uniform. Mr. Orozco and fellow officers Phil,
                            Eddie, and Andy took the police van over the Brooklyn Bridge. He said he
                            was, “surprised to see the traffic was still going over the three
                            bridges into the city.” Over the radio, he “heard officers from the
                            towers calling for help,” and says “it was one of the most helpless
                            moments of my life.” He parked the police van by South Street and
                            Beekman Hospital, borrowed some paper masks from the hospital and went
                            to the site. He said the sky was orange over the site. Rafael and his
                            fellow officers were called back to Brooklyn command for a mandatory
                            roll call. The first night he slept in the precinct in a chair. The next
                            day, he went back to the site as there was no relief for the officers
                            for 72 hours. He mentions the military had invoked “a quasi-martial law”
                            from Houston Street to Battery Park. During this period, Mr. Orozco also
                            had to take leave to drive his son to report to a Navy base in Florida.
                            He went to the base and came straight back to the precinct within 36
                            hours. At the site he was assigned to an area by St. Paul’s Church. St.
                            Paul’s became “a home away from home” where family members of victims
                            and working responders came to rest and pray. At St. Paul’s, Rafael
                            escorted family members to and from the site to the church. He remembers
                            that police officers often used humor to battle the sadness they felt
                            from the tragedy. Rafael also worked on the pier near South Street
                            Seaport, and he gave information and became a Spanish language
                            translator for visitors. He remembers that the wall by the pier was
                            turned into a memorial for the victims with teddy bears, pictures, and
                            comments. He was ok being there for the first couple of days, but then
                            it became difficult to stay. Rafael also recalls a time when a five-year
                            old girl came to visit the site with her family, and he walked her over
                            to the edge of the pit to show her the site. Rafael recalls that two
                            weeks after 9/11, the work stopped being a rescue mission and started
                            becoming a salvage mission. He remembers that up to two weeks after
                            9/11, the crime in the area was very low. He remembers that there was
                            great camaraderie between police officers and fireman as they both are
                            in the “hero business.” He believes that though the two groups have
                            their disagreements they are still like “two peas in a pod.” After
                            retiring from the force he continued to keep in touch with his coworkers
                            and they talk all the time. His final message is that, “Unless you were
                            there, you do not know what [they] went through."

       Martin was working as an NYPD narcotics detective in Queens on 9-11-2001.
                            On the morning of 9-11-2001, he reported to the city. He remembers first
                            visiting the site with his supervisor. Martin remembers that he was only
                            wearing a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. He remembers that it “smelled
                            bad” and “nothing echoed.” They grabbed a bucket and started work with
                            the bucket brigade. He remembers that on the bucket brigade there was a
                            line of people just passing buckets trying to find body parts. There was
                            no protective gear for the first few days. He recalls that they made a
                            triage out of a Burger King near Ground Zero. They were involved in
                            clean-up and were put on rotations at the site. He remembers eating a
                            lot and gaining a lot of weight during his time at the site, and
                            remembers at some point he thought, “I don’t know what the hell we were
                            looking for anymore…you found nothing, just dust.” He saw volunteers
                            from the Salvation Army and all over the country when they were working
                            at the pit. He also mentions seeing unity and patriotism among people,
                            and said “There were people holding signs (for responders) on the West
                            Side Highway.” Martin also did rotations down at the NYC morgue for 12
                            hour shifts, and worked at the Fresh Kills landfill where he and his
                            partner, Mike, found “socks with bones in it.” If he found any remains
                            he was responsible for informing family members. It was a difficult
                            time, because on top of this job there were his regular job
                            responsibilities. Martin worked on the WTC site for about 9 months.
                            Martin said of the WTC Clinic: “This is the only place that’s taken care
                            of me.” Martin mentioned his post 9/11 PTSD symptoms, which make it
                            difficult for him to move in crowds or to enjoy small things. Martin
                            said his experiences at Ground Zero, “Made me want to leave a legacy,
                            which are my children.”

       Jerry Vasquez worked as a NYPD police officer with the 73rd precinct in
                            Brooklyn on 9/11/2001. On the morning of 9/11, he was on desk duty
                            processing arrests. He heard from officers that a plane hit one of the
                            Twin Towers. He initially thought it was an accident. As the officers
                            watched T.V. from the lounge in the precinct, they saw the second plane
                            hit the tower. Jerry states, “Then many officers suspected this was an
                            act of terrorism.” He states, “There was a major adrenaline rush in the
                            atmosphere (of the precinct)”. Each precinct mobilized the first wave of
                            police officers and supervisors to send to the WTC site. He states that,
                            “The second wave of officers was on standby…we were all anxious to get
                            over there and help out.” While getting ready to ship out, the first
                            tower fell, and he states “The (police) radio was going crazy.” Jerry
                            and his fellow officers were bussed on the second wave over the Brooklyn
                            Bridge and into Canal Street. He states, “(On the bus) it was very
                            quiet, we talked about the events and listened to the (police) radio
                            which was very hectic.” He states, “We could smell the burning from
                            where my precinct was.” When they arrived, they got assignments from
                            their supervisors to secure the perimeter around the WTC area. He
                            states, “We didn’t want people to go into dangerous situations if they
                            weren’t trained.” On the first day, he spent about 12-13 hours securing
                            the site, and this went on for about two weeks. Then he was assigned to
                            rotations at the landfill. He also did his regular job in addition to
                            the rotations. He recalls, “The first day, I barely got any sleep…I
                            called my wife to let her know I was ok.” The day after 9/11, Jerry
                            drove from his home on Long Island to his precinct. He states, “The
                            Expressway was closed off… only the HOV lane was open for responders…we
                            had to show our badges at checkpoints.” Jerry recalls that, “The amount
                            of support was amazing…you saw people holding up signs thanking the NYPD
                            and firefighters.” He recalls that, “Civilians took it upon themselves
                            to bring food and water to responders…it was out of this world,” and
                            that, “People think New Yorkers are rude, but we’re not…when something
                            major happens we come together.” Jerry also noted the great
                            participation of NYPD, FDNY, federal agencies, and military. He mentions
                            that at this time there was great solidarity between NYPD and FDNY,
                            despite efforts by the public to label them as competitors. Jerry states
                            that the whole experience made him, “Proud to be an American, proud to
                            be a New Yorker.” He believes the NYPD and FDNY are a lot more prepared
                            with resources to deal with a situation like 9/11 in the future.

       Thomas was a NYC transit police officer for five years until becoming a
                            Suffolk County Police Officer in 1989. He was asleep at this home on the
                            morning of 9/11/01 and was awakened by a frantic neighbor asking for his
                            help in locating her husband, an air traffic controller. Thomas was a
                            part of the K-9 Unit of the SCPD. His dog was trained for both bomb
                            detection and to locate people. He and his dog met with other police
                            officers on 9/11 at MacArthur Airport for the purpose of bomb detection.
                            He mentioned there was nothing he could do at Ground Zero on 9/11 as it
                            was too hot for his dog to search. He arrived on the pile on 9/12 and
                            worked there for two weeks. He worked twelve hour shifts on the pile
                            with his dog and a group of firefighters. When the dog would find body
                            parts, they were placed in body bags. He did not find any intact bodies
                            and did not save anyone but was glad he was able to “bring closure.” He
                            spoke of difficulties with the dogs--their feet were blistered from the
                            intense heat, and after four hours on the pile, they were given IV
                            fluids for dehydration. He mentioned his dog seemed depressed after
                            being on the pile. Thomas expressed that he went back to the pile each
                            day because it was important and he wanted to help. He had a friend who
                            was killed and many of his friends and colleagues in NYC were
                            traumatized. He has learned to appreciate life a little more from his
                            experience at Ground Zero and has not lost faith in the U.S. Government.

       Donald was a Department of Transportation heavy equipment mechanic who
                            was sent to Ground Zero on 9/12/01. He worked at the site for six months
                            doing 12-hour shifts. He spoke of the division of Ground Zero into four
                            construction sites, his amazement at the amount of debris, and the tight
                            security after the first few days. Donald was stationed at a baseball
                            field nearby repairing trucks and heavy equipment. He said the ball
                            field eventually had to be paved as it became too muddy from all the
                            heavy equipment. The equipment frequently broke down and there were many
                            flat tires from being on the pile. He said it was “heartbreaking” to see
                            people search for loved ones, and it was hard to explain to his family.
                            His motivation was to do the best that he could and would do it again if
                            asked. Donald knew the air was bad because of the “haze and cloud for
                            days.” He thought the clean up went quick and whoever was in charge did
                            a “good job.” He is disappointed in the US government and said they are
                            very slow to respond to things. He tries not to think about 9/11 but
                            feels he handled it pretty well and hopes he never sees anything like
                            that again.

       John worked as a crane operating engineer on 9/11/2001. He was on a
                            coffee break on the morning of 9/11 when he heard news over the radio
                            that a plane hit the World Trade Center. When he turned on the T.V. he
                            saw the second plane hit the tower. John recalls that, "Immediately
                            everybody stopped work," and he reported to his local union office hall.
                            He worked on one of three mobile cranes that were conveyed to the WTC
                            site. He arrived at the site around 11 am on 9/11 and he recalls, "(I)
                            saw a dust cloud, papers all over the ground." John recalls, "(I) saw
                            the wheels from the airplane on the ground," and that, "They put cones
                            wherever they found a body part (so you wouldn't step on them)." He
                            mentions, "When running a crane, you're only supposed to get directions
                            from the signal man, but (that day) everyone was giving directions."
                            John remembers that, "Whoever needed you, you went to work for." He
                            particularly recalls the heroic efforts of ironworkers, stating, "Those
                            ironworkers were fantastic, they would work their way under the steel
                            looking for bodies and show up some 50 feet away." He worked at the site
                            from 11 am on 9/11 to 8 pm on 9/12/2001. He remembers sleeping on
                            makeshift cots that he and his co-workers took turns sharing. John
                            remembers, "[We got] peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to eat...we had
                            to eat them fast, or they would be covered with dust." He also remembers
                            seeing "a line right where that building [WTC Towers] stood, it was very
                            eerie." When he left the site, he recalls, "There was no transportation
                            out, we hitched a ride with a fire truck over the Brooklyn Bridge."
                            Afterwards, he states, “I got calls from family members thanking me, but
                            I didn't think I did anything special." He mentions that, "They [his
                            job] insisted on paying us, but I gave the money to my nephew [an Iraqi
                            war vet], I didn't feel comfortable keeping it." He adds the experience
                            made him learn that, "There are things (in life) that will never be
                            acceptable, but you learn to live with them." John retired as a crane
                            operating engineer in 2007 after he was diagnosed with Parkinson's
                            disease.

       Christopher was a contractor working for the Home Depot chain stores on
                            9/11. On that day, he was at home, when his cell phone and pager started
                            to go off. His friends called him to say that a small plane had hit the
                            World Trade Center tower. He turned on the T.V. and saw the second plane
                            hit. Christopher said, “(I) was waiting for it to be a movie.” He called
                            the Bellmore Fire Department and went to help as a volunteer
                            firefighter. Christopher mentions that he lied to his parents, telling
                            them he was in Connecticut. He didn’t want them to worry about him, and
                            also asked his brother-in-law, Carl, never to tell his parents where he
                            was going. He remembers driving down on the L.I.E. and seeing the plume
                            of smoke from the towers. He went with his band of fire trucks down the
                            Westside Highway, and remembers that, “It went from a clear blue sky, to
                            dark dirt and debris.” He remembers that everything was covered and it
                            was getting difficult to breathe. He worked in the bucket brigade with
                            the FBI and firefighters---the “core people.” Christopher remembers it
                            was a joy to work with them, but that changed over time as people wanted
                            to control things. Christopher remembers probably one of the most
                            powerful things was when someone yelled “Quiet!” to signify the
                            discovery of a body or a trapped person. He recalls finding his first
                            victim underneath a cross bar. He couldn’t find anybody alive,
                            recalling, “Even the cadaver dogs were having problems.” He remembers
                            when they found a police officer crushed under his patrol car, and
                            fellow police officers came to take the body away. Christopher said the
                            firefighters did the same for their fellow fighter victims. He recalls
                            when he needed a break and went up the Westside Highway and seeing a
                            line of people. At first he thought they were protestors, but they
                            pulled him out of his car and started hugging him. They were holding up
                            signs of gratitude, and Christopher recalls, ‘’they were phenomenal…I
                            still keep in touch with some of them.” He calls them the “Thank you
                            people” and said that “Without them I probably would never have made
                            it.” He specifically recalls the charity of people and companies like
                            Brockport, who donated new clothes and shoes to the responders. He
                            remembers there was a hotel by the Irish museum north of the site that
                            allowed responders in on a rotational basis to get some rest. He also
                            remembers that when responders sat for a meal at some NYC restaurants,
                            their bill would be paid. One fancy restaurant also had a sign up saying
                            they served “WTC responders only.” Christopher states, “My life began at
                            9/11, it drove me in a certain direction.” He remembers that “like
                            everybody else I ended up a single person out of 9/11.” He continued his
                            life by forming the advocacy group “Cops Helping Cops” which evolved
                            from his services as a responder in the Hurricane Katrina disaster.
                            Christopher draws some parallels between Hurricane Katrina and the 9/11
                            terrorist attacks. He concludes with, “I try to stay focused on the good
                            things…money is not the object…its about helping.”

       Kerry was a self-employed carpenter and volunteer firefighter on 9/11. He
                            was very anxious to go to Ground Zero to help. He waited for a call at
                            his firehouse on Long Island until Friday, 9/14/01, when he was asked to
                            go. He went to Ground Zero for one day with other volunteer firefighters
                            in a van loaded with supplies. They drove there on the LIE on the
                            morning of 9/14/01, and the closer he got to the site, the more surreal
                            it became. The ash was like snow. At some point he was in a cemetery
                            near Ground Zero and the tombstones were almost completely covered in
                            ash. He was in awe-- shocked and astounded by the carnage and
                            destruction. He got to the pile at noon but it looked like night.
                            Helicopters and military jets were flying overhead and he noticed the
                            rescue dogs had boots on and their eyes were caked with debris. He was
                            impressed with the amount of supplies--the sidewalks were lined with
                            thousands of cases of water, eyewash for dogs, food, clothing, etc.
                            Kerry buries his emotions and does not talk about 9/11 much, although he
                            will never get the images out of his mind. He had strange dreams after
                            9/11 and went to many funerals although he personally did not lose
                            anyone. He thinks the WTC Programs are “fantastic.” He said his mental
                            state since the event has gotten worse. He mentioned not long after the
                            event, he went to Disney World and at the airport, the metal in his
                            lungs set off the metal detector. He told his son, “The world will never
                            be the same.” Kerry is so glad he got had the opportunity to go to
                            Ground Zero and said he really enjoys doing such work. If another
                            disaster happened he would want to go and would hope to be a bigger part
                            of it. He now follows world events and the wars we are fighting much
                            more closely. He is much more on guard and feels a “lack of security”
                            since 9/11. He is also much more prepared for another event and expects
                            one to happen. He feels people have “forgotten” 9/11.

       Tyree Bacon oral history
                            interview conducted by Melodie Guerrera,

       Tyree was working as a senior court officer and Emergency Medical
                            Technician on 9-11-2001. As a senior court officer he worked at 100
                            Centre Street in Manhattan. His wife was serving as a police officer in
                            Greenwich Village at that time. He was in the 14th floor locker room of
                            the building when he heard the first plane fly by. He ran to the roof of
                            the building and saw the gaping hole on the side of one of the WTC
                            towers. He remembers being “awestruck” by the devastation. Tyree knew
                            the Emergency Medical Services system would be overwhelmed, so he
                            grabbed oxygen masks and ran to the vicinity of the World Trade Center.
                            He partnered with his colleague, Tommy, and went to grab air packs from
                            his EMT truck. Tyree recalls going to Church Street and saw wreckage
                            from the plane, some of which was debris and some human remains. He saw
                            injured people such as one woman “clearly having a heart attack” and a
                            gentleman with a “severe head laceration.” Tyree and his fellow
                            responders (firefighters) Tommy, Captain Harry, and Mitch (EMS) went
                            into Building 5 of the Trade Center, going against a stream of evacuees,
                            and ended up in the mall under Tower Two. Within the tower, Tyree speaks
                            of a harrowing experience rescuing a woman named Doris, a 32-year old
                            woman from the 78th floor of Tower Two. She had severe burns on more
                            than 50% of her body. He separated from his colleagues at that time, and
                            got Doris in a chair stretcher. When the tower collapsed, he was trapped
                            with Doris in the rubble below street level, and ultimately found his
                            way to a stairwell by feeling along the wall and dragging Doris with
                            him--they were then rescued. He recalls that when he came out
                            “Everything was gray, like the end scene in (the movie) Saving Private
                            Ryan.” Tyree believes that if he didn’t have Doris to rescue he would
                            have suffered the same fate as Tommy, Harry and Mitch. He remembers that
                            they eventually found Harry’s body---he was uniform and still had his
                            shield pinned to him. Doris was brought to a local hospital, but passed
                            away from severe burns. Tyree keeps in touch with Doris’ sister, who
                            takes only his phone call on the yearly anniversary of September 11th.
                            After working as a responder, Tyree did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
                            He got the Department of Defense Heroism award presented to him and
                            three other firefighters by the Pentagon. He believes some positives to
                            come out his experience were that “there were many random acts of
                            kindness” and that it “renewed my belief in God.”

       John was a member of the NYPD as a crime scene detective at the 111th
                            Precinct before 9/11. He was at home on the morning of 9/11 (out sick)
                            and recalled a “gorgeous day—picture perfect.” As soon as he heard of
                            the attack, he went to Ground Zero. When he arrived, he realized right
                            away that there would not be a lot of survivors. He saw vast amounts of
                            women’s shoes everywhere and a lot of papers in the surrounding areas.
                            He became concerned about his brother who worked on Wall Street and his
                            family. He went home after four hours at the site to be with his wife
                            and daughter. John returned to Ground Zero and worked at the pile, the
                            morgue and eventually at the Fresh Kills Landfill for a few months until
                            he retired in June of 2002. He thought he was immune to death after
                            working in the Crime Scene Unit for so many years but was unprepared and
                            awed by the devastation he witnessed at Ground Zero. John described the
                            landfill as gruesome and tough work; human remains were mixed in with
                            cement. He was amazed to find a Christmas ornament in the rubble and
                            giant cow bones from the restaurant at the WTC. When there was rain, the
                            ground would bubble from methane. He worked 12-hour shifts at the
                            landfill with a four hour commute leaving him exhausted. After a time,
                            he did not want to go to work anymore. He feels the clean up was too
                            rushed with a lack of safety gear and very little protection against
                            toxins. Masks with respirators did not come until a month or two later
                            and did not fit properly. He said it was impossible to do manual labor
                            with the mask, and it was windy at the landfill. He owned a gym at the
                            time of the attacks and had planned to work there in his retirement but
                            was forced to sell it because he was “burned out” after his work at the
                            landfill. He believes the government knew the air was toxic and Mayor
                            Giuliani rode his career on the backs of the NYPD and relished the
                            limelight. He feels the NYPD did their jobs and knew the event would be
                            forgotten when the first responders were being called “heroes.” Mr.
                            Palmer had a few close friends who died at the site and now has friends
                            dying “slow, painful deaths of rare cancers.” This saddens him and is a
                            constant reminder of the attack. He did not realize the effect the event
                            had on him but did become paranoid waiting for another event to happen.
                            He is convinced it is just a matter of time and there will be more
                            attacks in New York. He believes a dirty bomb is coming.

       Kenneth was working as a civil servant for the City of New York Highway
                            Department on 9-11-2001. He was working at Douglaston Parkway and was
                            told to report to his dockyard. The next day, his crew was taken by bus
                            to Canal Street and then they walked to the site. He was on the bucket
                            brigade and search and rescue teams doing tunnel work. He recalls, “I
                            was never trained for stuff like this.” Kenneth remembers that he knew a
                            couple of the cops and firemen working with him, as he had gone to
                            school with them. Kenneth remembers that for the first three days they
                            did not provide any specialized protective gear. Afterwards, they got a
                            pair of gloves and a jumpsuit to wear while working at the site. He
                            remembers that, “People gave us pictures to find their kids,” and said
                            that, “To find anyone would be a miracle from God.” Kenneth worked a 16
                            hour day for his first shift. He remembers that his union hall became a
                            command center for WTC responders. He recalls having to show his badge
                            to state troopers and CIA agents as proof that he could work on the
                            site. He recalls that first night at the site, food was available on the
                            street corner, and that everyone would eat quickly because of all the
                            dust in the air. Kenneth recalls that dump trucks were used to carry
                            away body parts found at the site. He went home the third morning, and
                            his clothes were so full of debris and ash that he had to throw them all
                            away. Afterwards, he took a shower and lay in his room, and didn’t say
                            anything to anyone for weeks. Kenneth worked at the site from September
                            2001 through Feb 2002. He was primarily motivated to return to the site
                            by his friends and “to give people closure.” Kenneth also experienced
                            health issues such as bronchitis, asthma and the “WTC cough,” and was
                            diagnosed with Reactive Airways Disease and PTSD. He recalls there being
                            a green smoke, maybe Freon, in the air one particular November day when
                            he worked at the site. In retrospect, Kenneth said he would think twice
                            before going back to work at the site. Due to his ill health following
                            his WTC work, he had to give up his job and now wonders who is going to
                            take care of his family if something happens to him. He mentions how his
                            son also got sick, after constantly seeing him sick. Kenneth said on a
                            positive note from his WTC response: “I met a lot of good
                            people…interesting people.”

       John was a sergeant in the Brooklyn Supreme Court at the time of 9/11
                            attacks. He spent two days on the pile starting on 9/12 and one day a
                            week later. He was awed at the complete destruction he witnessed and the
                            energy people had in dealing with the rescue and recovery. They worked
                            until they passed out. He had a total sense of disorientation while at
                            the site and it made him think of the old films of Pearl Harbor. He said
                            that day the totality of what happened did not hit him. John saw areas
                            in the wreckage where there were hundreds of pairs of shoes, but the
                            only thing he found intact was an old beer can. He said the respirators
                            made it hard to work, and he couldn’t breathe. He was angry and
                            frustrated at the event and felt it was unfair to fireman as they now
                            had to become both a cop and fireman and the event made their jobs much
                            tougher. On the first day he was more hopeful but said a week later was
                            much grimmer. He said everyone sensed they were being part of history
                            that day. He thought Mayor Giuliani was the right man for the job, but
                            he wishes that more information was given out about the air quality. He
                            feels the federal government tends to throw money at things instead of
                            expertise, which does more harm than good, and that the war on terror is
                            not focused enough. He believes something will happen again, and he is
                            relieved he is retiring soon. Despite his cynicism, he saw many nice
                            things people tried to do--good decent people doing the right thing. The
                            event has made him a little more afraid and aware.

       Joseph worked for NYC Department of Environmental Protection as a pipe
                            corker on 9/11/2001. He was at work installing two wet connections
                            underground when his helper told him a plane had crashed into the Trade
                            Center. Soon after, he heard over the work radio that all crews should
                            report to the local office on Pike Street in Lower Manhattan. He
                            remembers that “Traffic was mayhem, it was crazy getting downtown.”
                            Joseph also remembers the initial chaos, that “They locked the city
                            down, you couldn’t get a car in or out, you had to walk over the
                            bridges…cell phones weren’t working, nothing was working.” Joseph’s
                            local office was on 30 Pike Street, about a mile away from the WTC
                            towers. He remembers that “It was disorganized at first, it took a good
                            seven hours before we got word from our higher ups.” While they were
                            waiting at their local office, he remembers seeing people walking away
                            from the WTC area covered in dust and said, “It looked like the movie,
                            the Night of the Living Dead.” Once they got crews assembled, Joseph
                            mentions that, “The plan was to set a perimeter up and just cap all the
                            water mains that were going into the Trade Center.” He said, “A crew
                            would be myself and three laborers digging up, exposing the main,
                            cutting it, capping it and that would stop the water from traveling in
                            that direction.” Joseph worked around the clock on 12 hour shifts for as
                            long as three days stopping the water from blowing up. They had to
                            coordinate with other trades like the ironworkers during this process.
                            He remembers that the work was dangerous, and relates this experience:
                            “We were fixing a valve…I think it was 7 World Trade Center. It was
                            wobbly and the fire department put some kind of laser on it to tell when
                            it was going down, so my boss said if you hear a whistle or horn going
                            off, just get out of where you are as quickly as possible.” Joseph
                            continues to work at the site on the new construction. He put new valves
                            and wet connections to supply the new building that is being constructed
                            at the site. He said, “It’s coming back, its going to be better than
                            ever and if it was me that was doing the design, I would make it at
                            least one story higher than each of those two towers…to make a
                            point.”

       Patrick is a union laborer for a general contractor. At the time of the
                            attack he was in Queens and saw the event from the rooftop of the
                            building he was working in. He initially thought it was an accident
                            until he saw the second plane hit. He arrived at the site on 9/12 and
                            did not expect to see what he saw. He said the site was in chaos and the
                            overall destruction was shocking. His job was to clear debris and fine
                            soot by hosing down one area at a time at the Verizon area on West
                            Street. He didn’t know where to start and said the work was hard labor.
                            He was at Ground Zero for one month and slept in a truck for 2-3 hours a
                            night. He had a hard time sleeping. He was disappointed that the Red
                            Cross would not give him a mask; they were only given to firefighters
                            and police. He never saw such devastation. He tries not to think about
                            the event and not to let it bother him emotionally. He is disheartened
                            that nine years later the people responsible were not found. He probably
                            would not do it again due to health issues and he doesn’t think people
                            would respond in the same way. He feels government is not in the best
                            interest of the people.

       Thomas grew up in the Bronx and now lives in North Babylon on Long
                            Island. He worked locally as a teacher for thirty years, and then became
                            a reinforcing ironworker. He handles rebar all day, which is a
                            reinforcement material that is mixed with concrete. On 9/11/2001 he was
                            in his office on 76th Street and 3rd Avenue when a call came in that the
                            World Trade Center had been damaged. Then all of the phones in the
                            office went dead, and he decided to listen to reports the rest of the
                            day. On 9/12/2001, a bus carrying Thomas and “a whole bunch of people
                            from the union” went to the Trade Center and worked all day on the pile
                            cutting up steel and getting rid of it through a bucket brigade. Paper
                            masks were provided for them. One of the men was cut badly on his finger
                            by a piece of falling steel. Thomas returned as a volunteer for the next
                            few days and worked 10 hours a day. “It seemed like it was endless.” It
                            became a job to him and he decided not to go back. He noted that it was
                            only the cops and firemen who are getting the credit now. Thomas’s son
                            also worked as a volunteer. “It was like a patriotic duty.” Thomas
                            complained that the trains were not running on schedule and the days
                            were too long. He noted that most people who work in construction are
                            supposed to be prepared for the job. Thomas says “I can still sleep at
                            night knowing we did the right thing” and “I give credit to all the
                            people who volunteered.”

       Allan is a retired Police Captain and a forty year veteran with the New
                            York City Police Department (1962-2002). On 9/11/2001 his wife called
                            him with the news that an airplane had hit the World Trade Center. His
                            immediate thought was that it was a terrorist attack as there was no
                            reason for a large airplane to hit a building. It was Primary day and he
                            was leaving early, because the polls were open. After getting the news,
                            he drove at high speed, in an unmarked police car, with flashing lights
                            and a siren into the city, through the Midtown Tunnel and up to his
                            office at 21st Street. He had a driver take him down to the site,
                            unaware that the South Tower had collapsed. The driver took a wrong
                            turn, fortunately, delaying them on their route to where temporary
                            headquarters had been set up. He took the driver back to the office and
                            approached the site on a different route, walking down Vesey and Church.
                            Vesey, Church and West Streets were in total confusion. Allan heard a
                            tremendous noise and witnessed the North Tower crumbling. His instinct
                            told him to start running. He got a block away and the debris and
                            compressing air knocked him down. The atmosphere turned black. “I
                            inhaled all the black gas. I was breathing black gas and dust and pieces
                            of oxygen.” He thought he was being asphyxiated. He remained prone,
                            regulating his breath, holding it and breathing in until he could get up
                            and start to walk again. “An EMS worker grabbed me and cleaned my eyes
                            out.” By now Allan was filthy with soot and went in search of the
                            headquarters. Allan’s department had been having “dry practice runs for
                            things like this”, since the 1993 incident where Allan had worked during
                            the first bombing. He had stated then, that there was no way that the
                            buildings could be damaged enough to come down. In practice the initial
                            thing was to rescue people, and to protect property. Since he did not
                            believe that the buildings would collapse, he believed that “there was
                            time for the first responders to go in and do what was practiced.” Now,
                            in light of the collapse, and terrible traffic jams, this all had to
                            change. A vendor came up to Allan and offered him a chain link fence to
                            encircle the site, if he could put his company name on it at 100 foot
                            intervals. It was accepted and soon the “red Zone” was confined and
                            protected from looters and the public. Having the fence was critical, as
                            there were two dozen arrests before it went up. To set up security and
                            prevent looting, the chiefs came in from all the different boroughs.
                            They worked 16 hours a day, interacting with heads of all the agencies
                            including the Office of Emergency Management (O.E.M.). They assigned
                            workers in two 12 hour shifts at all sites except Staten Island. The
                            whole country worked to help. Allan said, “The city came together like
                            never before. They brought and unloaded clothing, underwear, tee shirts,
                            and boots at the thirteenth precinct station house. People from all
                            around the country were cooking and donating food. Everyone wanted to do
                            something to help. Thousands of law enforcement people and National
                            Guard came from all over the country and pitched in as they were
                            trained, and did random patrols to keep order. Allan said that all in
                            all “the response was excellent… we set up everything very quickly.”
                            Allan also mentioned that this disaster unified all of the different
                            cultures in the city. There were definite problems with family members
                            looking for their loved ones by placing pictures around the area that
                            asked "Have you seen this person?" Manhattan South was disorderly with
                            parades. People were trying to adapt to the confusion and trying to
                            return home in the area. The out-of-towners were very distracting, and
                            some were looting. It was a difficult task restricting them. There was
                            smoke and fires burning “every color of the rainbow.” With the implosion
                            everything was vaporized and only debris was left. Initially there was
                            little concern about the air quality because of the chaos. Unfortunately
                            there were problems and in hind sight, Allan would advise more caution.
                            An out of town medical group came in to examine people two weeks later.
                            They heard “crackle” in the lungs, a condition where the lungs of
                            non-smokers try to get rid of foreign matter. The air quality was not as
                            good as they had been promised and the future was to be riddled with
                            cancer deaths. Allan himself lost a friend who died of cancer at age 40.
                            Fluid zones were put in place to allow those who lived or worked in the
                            area to enter it. They were to move on quickly to their destination. The
                            NYPD did an excellent job in setting perimeters and helping people in
                            and out of the area. All of these maneuvers resulted in good management
                            training and are now used by the city in times of high volume people
                            control such as New Year’s Eve. Allan had one son who came and helped
                            him in all areas of the zone looking for miscreants. He caught two
                            security officers steeling computers from the building they were hired
                            to protect. In his early 40s he died of lung cancer, leaving a wife and
                            three small sons. His other son caught the last train out of the city
                            after seeing people jumping out of the towers, and never returned. Allan
                            concluded by saying that “There are people in the world bent on
                            destruction,” and “You have to be on the alert at any time.” Old war
                            strategies no longer work. There must be restrictions now, which are at
                            odds with the rights of people, such as searches, and crowd control to
                            protect people so that they can be safe.

       Ronald is an immigrant from Guyana who came to the United States when he
                            was 20 years old. He was a construction supervisor at the time of the
                            attack and felt compelled to help in any way he could. He feels a great
                            sense of gratitude toward the United States. His father died when Ronald
                            was eight years old, and he recalled his time as child in Guyana when
                            the only food his family had was from the United States. He clearly
                            remembered seeing the bags of cornmeal and milk marked “USA—Not to be
                            Sold.” He believes without this food from the United States, his family
                            would have starved. He was on the pile with only a bucket, hook, gloves,
                            and paper mask. He spoke of the three emotions he felt when he initially
                            got to Ground Zero—his stomach in knots, anger, and uncertainty. Ronald
                            was part of the bucket brigade and said his lasting memory is the body
                            bags. He could not comprehend another human being doing this act and
                            would not wish it on his worst enemy. He thanks God everyday for the
                            privilege of being in the United States and said there is no other city
                            he would prefer to live in. He felt unprepared for the event but wanted
                            to be there. He became angry and withdrawn after 9/11 and said he is
                            still angry. He could not talk or go anywhere. He said he was one of the
                            recipients of compassion of this country and he would do it again in a
                            second.

       Chris was a general manager and co-owner of an environmental cleanup
                            company that cleaned buildings for insurance companies. He did not start
                            work near Ground Zero until he was called by an insurance company in
                            early October to give an estimate on cleaning condominiums near the WTC.
                            He had previously done work at the WTC removing asbestos and knew of the
                            danger of toxins. Chris worked long days in the beginning of his time at
                            Ground Zero-- from 5 AM to 1 AM. He spent the first six months staying
                            at the Marriott in midtown Manhattan to avoid commuting to his home in
                            Sayville. At the time he was at the hotel, there were only 6 or 7 rooms
                            taken, and he did not hear a taxi beep for three months. The first time
                            he went to Ground Zero, he said Penn Station was like a “ghost town” and
                            flyers were all over the walls from people looking for their loved ones.
                            Adrenaline drove him and he was focused to get the job done. Since it
                            was such a “gorgeous day” on 9/11, many people had their windows open,
                            and the dust in the buildings was about 1-2 inches thick. He knew the
                            dust was silicate (concrete) dust, but it was “impossible to protect
                            yourself all of the time.” Chris supervised cleaning projects. His
                            company was a union shop with a stop steward on all jobs and hired union
                            workers rather than day laborers. According to Chris, there were 500-600
                            day laborers lined up on Broadway every day. He said the clean-up
                            process was deregulated and thought it was understandable since the
                            government could not shut down the stock exchange. There was still dust
                            in the buildings in November of 2001, and he cleaned many buildings in
                            many places. Chris had a few friends that worked at the WTC but all were
                            unharmed. He was in buildings adjacent to Ground Zero for 18 months and
                            now has serious health issues. He has gained a lot of weight as a result
                            of being sedentary due to his illness. Since 9/11, he has gotten
                            divorced and has become antisocial. He feels the tragedy completely
                            changed his life and he lives in the shadow of what he used to be.

       Bonnie was an EMT for Flushing Hospital Medical Center. On 9/11 she
                            arrived at work where she and her partner prepared an ambulance for the
                            day. Over the radio, they heard there was a MCI (mass casualty incident)
                            at the WTC and drove toward Ground Zero. As they were coming out of the
                            tunnel, they saw the second plane hit. They arrived in the surrounding
                            area of Ground Zero and were told by a captain to go into the South
                            Tower. Bonnie entered the South Tower and began to try to help others
                            evacuate. It never occurred to her that the buildings would fall until
                            she heard, “It's going to blow” and started to run. A huge fireball came
                            out of the South Tower and entombed Bonnie in Financial 1 from her
                            ankles to her hips. She was sealed in the rubble with 30 other people in
                            the pitch black. The air became thinner and thinner and they all thought
                            they would die. A policeman who was trapped with them shot through a
                            window three times creating an escape. All 30 people went out through
                            the hole in the window into the dark. She and her partner then walked
                            north to a deli and began triaging people but were forced to leave as
                            they were afraid the deli would collapse. She heard another explosion
                            when the second tower fell and ran to a parking garage. She managed to
                            dig out of the parking garage and get to water and where she could see
                            the light of day. She helped load people on boats until she felt sick
                            and suffered an asthma attack. She was given oxygen on a boat headed to
                            New Jersey. Bonnie felt there was no more she could do. She was a
                            caretaker for her grandmother and was worried about her. She and her
                            partner were admitted to a hospital in Bayonne, NJ. She signed herself
                            out of the hospital and went to Jamaica Hospital where she remained for
                            two and a half days and was discharged. She had multiple injuries and
                            was out of work for two and a half months. Bonnie completed her
                            interview with us in two parts. She spoke about 9/11 advocacy and the
                            organizations she established and joined to help meet the needs of first
                            responders. She joined “Heroes Helping Heroes” and has been on many
                            boards since 9/11. She was chosen as a 9/11 survivor delegate to go to
                            Oklahoma City for an exchange program. She was impressed by the Oklahoma
                            City memorial and saw the impact on families there. She felt
                            acknowledgement in Oklahoma City much more than in New York. At present,
                            she is not as involved in advocacy as she once was. Bonnie became ill in
                            2004 and said it was “the beginning of the end” for her. She was forced
                            to stop working at this point as a result of asthma, bronchitis and
                            sinusitis. In addition, she had to battle with Workers’ Compensation to
                            cover many reconstructive surgeries on her thumb, wrist and elbow. Her
                            surgery was finally authorized after her arm and hand turned blue. She
                            felt she had to beg for what she was entitled to and said it was a
                            tedious process. Bonnie believes people went back to who they were a few
                            weeks after 9/11, shaking her spirituality and changing her concept of
                            God. She entered the seminary looking for an answer and graduated in
                            2004. She presided over her friend Tim’s funeral, an EMT who died as a
                            result of complications from 9/11 illness. She said there is no reason
                            “we should be dying at this rate.” Half the people she was buried alive
                            with are now deceased. She believes firemen and policemen received
                            preferential treatment and EMS was in the background. She said, “Firemen
                            are portrayed as angels and Gods” and no one wants to hear about EMS.
                            “Firemen get citations and meet the mayor and EMS gets pins.” Bonnie
                            would love to have 9/10/01 back; she feels she has become a different
                            person as a result of her involvement in 9/11.

       David is a former Marine and Ensign in the US Coast Guard. On 9/11, he
                            was a mate (officer) on the Staten Island Ferry on 9/11 on the 5:30 AM
                            to 1:30 PM shift. The first plane hit the trade center when he was
                            ferrying 5,000 people towards Manhattan. The ferry turned around and
                            brought the passengers back to Staten Island. He returned to Manhattan
                            many times that day to pick up passengers and bring them back to Staten
                            Island, about a 20 minute ride. There was no visibility due to the dust
                            in the air and radar had to be used to navigate to Staten Island. David
                            said the ferry was carrying double the amount of passengers allowed on
                            the boat-- approximately 10,000 people covered in dust and debris. He
                            said strangers were holding hands and praying, but there was no panic.
                            He explained that because the subways and tunnels were closed so many
                            people escaped via the waters surrounding NYC. After his shift on the
                            ferry ended at 1:30 PM, David went to the pile and joined the bucket
                            brigade. He had only a cloth mask which he said was useless. He
                            described the pile as unstable and smoky. He was impressed by everyone
                            wanting to “do something” and said there were all sorts of people on the
                            pile in addition to cops and firemen. He was shocked at the devastation
                            he witnessed and worked both on the ferry and the bucket brigade for two
                            weeks until he came down with pneumonia. David would go back to another
                            disaster if he was needed. He is retired as of the time of his
                            interview.

       William is a former security officer who worked for the Summit Security
                            Company on 9/11/2001. He said he knew a lot of people in Summit Security
                            who didn’t make it out of the building. He went down to Ground Zero as a
                            volunteer medic with the NYFD. He said he helped firemen by talking to
                            them after they engaged in rescue and recovery operations. William
                            talked in great detail about his role in consoling firefighters, and the
                            lack of protective equipment provided to inspectors and volunteers who
                            served at Ground Zero. He said after this experience he was not able to
                            see any movies made about the 9-11-2001 terrorist attacks. William
                            mentions he would serve as a volunteer if such an attack happened again.
                            He suggests other people volunteer too, but recommends that they should
                            look out for their own welfare and that of their families before jumping
                            in to help. He also mentions that the U.S. government has not been
                            committed to providing continuing care for those who served down at
                            Ground Zero, and believes that people were mislead about the air quality
                            down at the site.

       Demetrius was a sheet metal worker for Local 28 on 9/11. He was working
                            in Manhattan when the planes hit the towers. He immediately realized we
                            were under attack and went home. It took him six hours to get to his
                            home in Holtsville. Demetrius is a certified welder and steel cutter and
                            knew his skills would be useful at the site. On 9/12 he went to his job
                            and picked up his tools and headed to the 59th Street Armory where
                            badges and assignments were given out. He received his assignment and
                            went with two of his coworkers by bus escorted by the police to Ground
                            Zero. On the way, he was very nervous and expected the worst. When he
                            entered the site, he described those leaving the scene as “beat up.”
                            They were covered in dust and debris--some were injured and some were
                            crying. There was carnage and smoke and destroyed vehicles being hauled
                            away to make room for responders to get into the site. He was assigned
                            to the “the big crater” where fires were still burning and there was a
                            great deal of smoke--he described it as very deep and dangerous. He had
                            no protective equipment except for a dust mask, but was motivated to
                            find people alive. He said the horn would blow frequently, creating a
                            dangerous situation because everyone would run off the pile, causing
                            people to be cut by steel and trampled. He learned to just stay still as
                            some of the firemen did when the horn blew since it seemed more
                            dangerous to run. He cut steel into small pieces and was aware of the
                            bodies beneath him. The hardest part for him was not finding anyone
                            alive. During the three days he spent at Ground Zero, he found six
                            bodies. He was upset people were taking pictures and taking personal
                            belongings from the deceased. He spent three days at Ground Zero as a
                            volunteer. The high point for him was being interviewed by Mike Sheehan
                            of Channel 5 News. Demetrius moved to Florida for a few years after 9/11
                            and was upset people outside of New York forgot 9/11. He went to his
                            daughter’s school and complained to the principal and was promised there
                            would be a “moment of silence” the next year on 9/11. He wishes that
                            9/11 was a national holiday and would give up another holiday for it.
                            His family was very proud of his efforts and had a party for him. He now
                            lives back in New York and said he would do it all over again but would
                            not go without a respirator.

       Philip was a building inspector for the city of New York on 9-11-2001. He
                            was at a meeting on the 14th floor of a building that was seven blocks
                            away from the World Trade Center. After the planes hit, he and his
                            coworker, Ivan, went to the roof of the building. He recalls his
                            coworker commented, “This ain’t no little plane—something big happened
                            here.” Then they saw another plane hit the second tower. He recalls
                            seeing through binoculars, that there were people jumping out the
                            windows of the tower. Philip and his co-worker drove their car to the
                            World Trade Center. They were on the corner of Barclay Street by the
                            towers when they saw the cloud. He said, “It was swirling and coming at
                            us…we all started running… the only way to get out was on foot.” Philip
                            and his partner ran to get away from the crowd. He remembers that his
                            partner, Ivan, decided to stop and pray. Philip continued running from
                            Barclay Street to Church Street. He recalls, “I was so disoriented…I
                            didn’t know east from west, north from south…I got lost.” He eventually
                            got to Queens, and remembers that he didn’t take the subway because he
                            didn’t think it was going to be safe. He also remembers that, “Nobody
                            knew anything…everybody was in shock.” He remembers that he never
                            thought they were under attack, and said, “That was the first time I
                            heard of bin Laden…Al Qaeda.” On Philip’s next workday, everybody was
                            put in groups—inspectors, engineers, architects, and building
                            inspectors. Their task was to assess the damage in the surrounding
                            buildings by Ground Zero. He recalls that they were equipped with white
                            dust masks and Tyvek suits. They didn’t get respirators for two weeks.
                            He also mentions that, “Nobody did the inspections themselves, it was
                            always in a group.” There was also a lack of facilities for his staff.
                            He recalls sleeping on the floor and eating Big Macs, and only later
                            found out that there was a Nino’s restaurant nearby that was offering
                            free meals to WTC responders. He felt there was a disparity in equipment
                            and facilities and recognition between emergency WTC responders and
                            other types of responders. Philip also spoke of his physical and mental
                            health problems that emerged after his time as a WTC responder. He
                            reveals that he experienced anxiety attacks, and was diagnosed with PTSD
                            and sleep apnea after serving as a 9/11 responder.

       Fred, a volunteer firefighter, worked in the communications sector for
                            Cablevision on 9-11-2001. He was also involved in restoring some of the
                            communications equipment after the 1993 World Trade Center fire bomb.
                            After 9-11-2001, Fred got a call from the fire department asking if he
                            wanted to assist in the WTC attacks recovery effort. He felt it was his
                            responsibility to go. They used light trucks from the Department of
                            Suffolk County. Fred arrived at the WTC site on 9-15-2001, and recalls
                            “it was pitch dark and you couldn’t see anything” and “the whole area
                            was filled with dust…like powder.” He spent 5 hours at Ground Zero
                            providing lighting to the area so that workers could clean up the site.”
                            He remembers that “civilians weren’t allowed in.” The area was mostly
                            full of construction workers and welders. The sanitation department had
                            giant vacuum trucks to aid with the recovery and clean-up process. On
                            reflection, Fred believes that “I believe we all lived through 9/11…the
                            whole country did,” but said that “The problem with American society is
                            that we have short-term memory…we forget.”

       Arthur has been a podiatrist in Queens for 50 years. He heard about the
                            first plane hitting the towers on his way to vote in a primary. He
                            returned to his office and watched the events unfold on the television
                            in the waiting room of his office. He knew right away he had to do
                            something. With the College of Podiatry and the Podiatry Association, he
                            coordinated an effort of podiatrists working 6-8 hour shifts for eight
                            months to treat foot injuries at Ground Zero. Podiatrists came from all
                            over the country donating their time and effort to the cause. An area in
                            St. Paul's Chapel was designated as a podiatry office. A pew where
                            George Washington prayed was converted into the podiatry office. There
                            was also a chiropractic office and massage therapy in the chapel. All
                            supplies were donated. For the first 2-3 months, there were many
                            injuries, sprains, blisters, etc., to treat. Arthur said the mood in the
                            chapel was emotional but uplifting. The entire chapel was decorated with
                            banners and posters from children around the county, and became a refuge
                            for first responders where they could rest and have their injuries
                            treated. There were cots set up for sleeping and musicians played
                            soothing music. During the first three months, Arthur said the air was
                            heavy and musty and he knew it was toxic. The smell never dissipated and
                            the chapel was filled with dust. He has health issues as a result of his
                            time spent at Ground Zero and goes to the Mt. Sinai Clinic three times a
                            month. Arthur has a wall in his office dedicated to 9/11. His daughter
                            is an artist and did a painting entitled “Repairing the World” which
                            hangs there. He bonded with many of the people he worked with at St.
                            Paul's and attends reunions. He keeps in contact with many of the people
                            he met there. He is also involved with the Zadroga bill and has gone to
                            Washington with the FealGood Foundation to lobby for it. He is upset
                            that the bill wasn’t passed yet and hopes it will be soon.

       Thomas was a Port Authority Police Officer on 9/11. He is now an NYPD
                            officer with the K-9 Unit and lives in Lindenhurst, NY. His wife was
                            walking into the South Tower when it was hit-- vertebrae in her neck
                            were crushed, and her neck was broken. While he was in the car
                            approximately 5-6 blocks away, the second plane flew over his car. He
                            saw the second plane hit the tower and explode. He said it sounded like
                            a firecracker and a giant fireball shot out of the building. Thomas was
                            initially assigned to the temporary morgue at the Staten Island Ferry
                            terminal for a few days where he felt “useless” until it was realized
                            there were no survivors of the attack. He then spent two weeks on the
                            bucket brigade and did not leave Manhattan for two weeks. He compared
                            the surface of the pile to walking on the moon. There were giant holes
                            and it was hard to dig because of the amount of all the steel. He said
                            he was in awe of the whole magnitude of the event. He spoke of the 2-3
                            inches of dust on the sidewalk and how his first impression was that “it
                            looked like a Terminator movie.” He said the mall at the Trade Center
                            was empty and seemed like a horror movie. He recalled the heat from the
                            pile and felt he was unprepared for this kind of work. He found
                            postcards from the observation deck in the pile but said steel was the
                            most recognizable thing. He was then assigned to secure the subways from
                            looters, and worked in the surrounding area until 2006. Thomas said
                            there were 23 Port Authority police officers killed and his cousin, a
                            firefighter, was also killed. His body was never found but there was a
                            funeral with an empty casket that he said “didn’t seem real.” He also
                            noted that in the first attack on the WTC five people died and on 9/11
                            only five people survived. Thomas just wanted to find survivors and to
                            give people closure. He said not a day goes by that he doesn’t think
                            about it and it hardened him in a way and that it “froze” him. He spoke
                            of the refuge of St. Paul's Chapel and how people bent over backwards to
                            help responders. He said “whatever you needed, someone was there.”

       Joseph is a Long Island native and former Marine who on 9/11 was a
                            lieutenant with the New York State Park Police. He was upstate in
                            Syracuse at the New York State Park Police Academy on the day of the
                            attacks and watched the event unfold on television. He felt he needed to
                            be there and could not get there fast enough. He arrived at Ground Zero
                            on 9/12. Joseph recalled the lack of skyline while driving into the city
                            and was told it was a “war zone” and was told by other officers that he
                            was “going into hell.” When he arrived in the city he was amazed by the
                            quiet. On the pile, it was hard to get his bearings and there was
                            “crunching” underfoot from the debris. He was eventually stationed at
                            Pier 26 until July of 2002 where the debris was unloaded onto barges and
                            brought to the Staten Island Landfill. To Joseph, it seemed as though
                            the job would never end. On his first day at Pier 26, families came with
                            coffee cans to bring ashes home. His motivation to work at the Pier was
                            to preserve remains for the families. As a boss, he found it difficult
                            to keep his emotions in check. Joseph feels the event changed many
                            people. Some found spirituality and one friend became an alcoholic. It
                            is something he doesn’t talk about much, but he will never forget. The
                            event put his life in perspective and has mellowed him out. Joseph
                            believes 9/11 was an event that changed how Americans think but thinks
                            New York City is a resilient place and is now back to normal. He found
                            the cheering of the public heartwarming and patriotic but thinks they
                            have a short memory. He sees the country as vulnerable and is always
                            looking for risk. He said he would respond again to another disaster but
                            this time “only faster.”

       Joseph was a retired/disabled nurse/volunteer firefighter/EMT on 9/11. He
                            saw the attacks on TV and since he had medical training, he felt he
                            should go and help. He was angry and felt we were at war and he “had to
                            be there.” He was dropped off at the Red Cross in Yaphank and went with
                            the National Guard in a Humvee over the Brooklyn Bridge to reach the
                            site. They parked three blocks away and walked through debris he
                            described as like “snow.” He saw dust everywhere: burned papers,
                            vehicles crushed and many shoes. He said it was eerie and quiet. He was
                            directed to go to Stuyvesant High School where he performed first aid in
                            the lobby. He was asked to coordinate a small medical unit. He organized
                            supplies and created areas for cardiology, respiratory, and psych. He
                            took names of volunteers. It was quiet the first night and he mostly
                            cleaned the debris from eyes. Joseph was unable to sleep and stayed up
                            for three days until Friday morning when he went home to DJ for a
                            wedding. An ambulance took him to Penn Station. When he came out into
                            the world he saw signs and people cheering. He returned to the makeshift
                            clinic on Sunday morning to find that FEMA had shut it down. He was
                            commended by FEMA for setting up the unit. Joseph also joined the bucket
                            brigade for a few days. He believes many people have lost perspective
                            now. He is disappointed he never received an award or a thank you for
                            his efforts at Ground Zero.

       Robert works as a detective with the NYPD in Astoria, Queens. He has
                            worked in the police force for 16 1/2 years. On 9/11/2001, his wife
                            called to say the Twin Towers had been hit. Robert got a second call
                            from work to report in. He recalls that the Long Island Expressway was
                            shut down, and only cops, firemen, and emergency personnel were allowed
                            to use the Expressway. Robert said, “The five boroughs were basically
                            locked down.” He states, “Everybody had to be in uniform, no matter what
                            your rank was.” He remembers going from his precinct to Mt. Sinai
                            Hospital to interview anybody who was hit by debris. Robert remembers,
                            “It was 10 or 11’o’clock at night, (and) Manhattan was aglow.” He worked
                            day and night shifts from 4 a.m. to 4 p.m. on 9/12/2010 at the Staten
                            Island landfill. He saw four stories of the World Trade Center impacted
                            and recalls “there was smoke everywhere.” Robert said, “Manhattan looked
                            like Beirut, a war zone.” He recalls that an alarm system was setup in
                            case any beams fell at the WTC site. Robert remembers that day the
                            clothes he wore were the ones he came home with. Robert remembers that
                            he started wearing Tyvek suits and masks once he started working in the
                            landfill. In the landfill, he worked through sifting the debris from
                            Ground Zero and recalls finding watches and a mangled police shield. At
                            home, he recalls that he kept things bottled up and recalls that there
                            was difficulty keeping work and home boundaries. Robert worked at the
                            landfill and morgue for 12 hour shifts. He remembers that the landfill
                            smelled like burnt flesh. He recalls that on Christmas Eve, he was at
                            the morgue from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and found 27 bodies that day.

       Robert was a volunteer firefighter and an accountant for a financial
                            software firm across the street from the World Trade Center on 9/11. He
                            had just gotten off the C train when the first plane hit. The explosion
                            rocked the platform and threw passengers down the stairs. He dropped
                            everything but his wallet and cell phone and ran toward the firehouse on
                            Liberty Street and offered his help. The firehouse was chaos: Dazed
                            people milling about, injured ones being carried in by coworkers. There
                            were cuts and bruises, a dislocated shoulder and a woman had been
                            severely burned. There was also a man named Fu with a fractured hip and
                            a briefcase he would not let go of . Two firefighters arrived, Brian
                            Gordon and Brian Smith, who helped with first aid. While they were in
                            the firehouse, the second tower was hit and then fell. The blast rolled
                            in and Robert was caught standing up, swept up in a crush toward the
                            rear exit. When it was finally quiet, there was panic and people were
                            trying to find a way out. People were injured and bleeding. A company of
                            firefighters arrived and they passed the injured out of a window. They
                            evacuated the firehouse and then the second tower fell. They all walked
                            to an office building a few blocks south on Rector Street carrying Fu
                            who could not walk and would not drop his briefcase. It was later
                            discovered the briefcase was packed with cash--a loan from the Chinese
                            government. The survivors washed their eyes and breathed fresh air in
                            the office building and proceed to walk single file down Broadway to
                            find buses to take them out of the city. A man in a fishing boat offered
                            to take him to New Jersey where a friend who lived in Hoboken met him
                            and took him to his apartment. The FBI came knocking at the apartment
                            door around midnight to investigate reports of people cheering on the
                            roof when the planes hit. Robert finally went home on Wednesday morning
                            via the Path train and the LIRR. Robert went to four funerals in one day
                            and became afraid of the dark. He volunteered at St. Paul’s Chapel,
                            helping with food prep once a week until 5/31/02. He made many friends
                            there, and keeps in touch with the two Brian's. Fu comes to his holiday
                            parties. He ended up getting really “burnt out” and was consumed by the
                            event. He has since done training with Homeland Security and taken
                            terrorist classes. He tries to keep things in perspective.

       Christopher was a college student at St. John's University and a member
                            of the Army National Guard at the time of the attacks on 9/11. He was
                            getting ready to go to class on 9/11 when a friend called him to tell
                            him the US was under attack. Christopher was a ROTC Platoon Leader and
                            immediately headed for the Armory on Kingsbridge Road in the Bronx.
                            Because of the chaos at Ground Zero, his platoon was ordered not to go
                            to the site until 9/12. Christopher arrived on a bus from the Bronx at 9
                            AM on 9/12 and described the area as desolate. He saw papers all over
                            the place and although he did have a respirator, he said there was a
                            “heavy chemical smell in the air.” He knew after a half hour that no one
                            was alive. Christopher’s job at Ground Zero was security on the east
                            side of the pile to stop people, photographers, etc. from entering the
                            site. While walking to the east side of Ground Zero, he was approached
                            by family members asking him to look for their loved ones. Trying to
                            instill confidence in the family members was the most difficult part of
                            his time at the site. He also tried to instill confidence in his Platoon
                            and said everyone under his command handled the situation well. He
                            described a huge “influx of materials” that were stored in the Javits
                            Center. Eventually his platoon was ordered to move the materials from
                            the Javits Center to a warehouse in Westbury, Long Island. Christopher
                            felt there was a stark difference in the treatment of the responders in
                            Westbury than in New York City. He feels they were treated much better
                            in NYC and was disappointed in the lack of patriotism in both the Bronx
                            and Westbury. He thinks the “feeling is lost now.” Christopher went to
                            Iraq in 2004 and became a specialist in supplies and logistics. He
                            outfitted 14,000 Iraqi police with uniforms in two months and then did
                            security inspecting vehicles and people. He remained in Iraq for 11
                            months and 20 days, and cites his sense of patriotism as his main
                            motivation for going. Christopher believes politicians had a very
                            different response than the military to the attacks and was disappointed
                            that it took George Bush a few days to get to the site. He believes the
                            toll of human impact is rising everyday and he may reenlist in the
                            National Guard. He would go again to another disaster if needed.

       Michael was a second generation NYC detective on 9/11. He worked seven
                            years undercover in Manhattan before working at Ground Zero on the
                            bucket brigade and at the Fresh Kills Landfill. He retired in 2007. On
                            9/12, Michael traveled from his home in Ronkonkoma to the 7th Precinct
                            in Manhattan. He described the LIE like a “horror flick,” with no
                            traffic and many accidents. He travelled over the Williamsburg Bridge to
                            his precinct and saw people in shock and firemen on their knees crying.
                            He walked with his lieutenant to the site and could not believe the
                            carnage and chaos. He went to the WTC Building Seven, which was burning
                            inside and eventually collapsed at 5:30 PM. He was covered in dust and
                            debris and slept in a car until the next day. He described fear of
                            another attack in the voices on the radio and the “nightmare of locator
                            beacons going off,” knowing there were human remains underneath him. His
                            children were affected by his absence and he had no contact with his
                            family for 2-3 days. Michael said all investigative units were needed at
                            Ground Zero and the resources on the pile were NYC detectives. Their
                            jobs included recovering body parts on rooftops, escorting people from
                            out of state, and the bucket brigade. While on the bucket brigade,
                            Michael had no mask and used a bandanna to cover his mouth. He found the
                            most difficult part of digging in the pile were when he found photos of
                            people in the rubble. His sergeant lost his father in the attacks.
                            Michael says, “We all knew somebody.” He described the event as “a
                            living hell” and horrific. According to Michael, OSHA was removed from
                            the site and NYC took over. There was dust everywhere, on the cars, on
                            the food served to the responders. He knew in his heart the air was bad.
                            Michael believes this to be the cause of many of the responders’ GI
                            problems. In his unit, five detectives were diagnosed with Hodgkin’s
                            lymphoma and there are others with different types of cancer. He is
                            saddened by the loss of 179 police and 46 suicides of police officers
                            since the attacks. He claims over 1,000 people have died since the
                            attacks-- some from out of state. Michael attended many funerals—his
                            lieutenant, age 45, had a massive heart attack while eating dinner with
                            his family. He said his faith was tested that day, until he was brought
                            to a cavern in a parking garage 150 feet below Ground Zero, where he saw
                            a ray of sunshine coming through the wall and fallen steel beams that
                            had formed three crosses. The event changed his life and restored his
                            faith in God. Michael became very sick in November of 2001 and again in
                            2004. He said he put his family through hell and became sick and
                            cynical. He is thankful for the WTC Program and credits it with saving
                            his life. He has PTSD but did not realize it until he retired. He spent
                            2008 starting the Police Aid Foundation, an organization for police
                            officers who are sick as a result of their time at Ground Zero. He
                            travels the county to advocate for the organization. He is disappointed
                            in the mindset of some people who feel responders should “get over it”
                            and believes the event had an everlasting effect on peoples’ lives. He
                            thinks there should be some kind of national education program because
                            he believes it will happen again. Michael has a lot of disdain for the
                            Bush administration and feels they “used us as a political pawn.” He has
                            been an advocate for the Zadroga Bill for six years and said after Pearl
                            Harbor, all Hawaiians were covered for any illnesses. He thinks
                            “cowards” are in position and some people think it is a “New York
                            problem.” He thinks Pataki did a good job as governor at the time of the
                            attacks, but the current administration has “no time for it.” He said
                            “nine years later there is still a hole in the ground due to corruption
                            and greed.” Michael said he absolutely would do it again if needed.

       Robert grew up in the Bronx and moved to Long Island in 1968. He was in
                            the Air Force for four years, the NYPD for 26 years, and was a fire
                            safety director of a 60-story building. On 9/11 he was the security
                            supervisor of the JP Morgan Complex in the NYC downtown area
                            approximately 2-3 blocks from Ground Zero. He was responsible for 4-5
                            buildings that were interconnected and a 60-story building on Wall
                            Street. He retired from JP Morgan in 2003. On the day of the attacks,
                            Robert went to work on the LIRR and took the No. 2 train downtown to his
                            office. He was informed by a coworker that the towers were hit and went
                            up to a higher floor in the building, where he saw the smoke and flames
                            billowing from the towers. He called his security team together and
                            instructed then to bring all employees down from the higher floors and
                            check the buildings for anything suspicious. Outside of the building, he
                            saw people walking around aimlessly in shock. He looked up to see a
                            “tidal wave of black coming down the street.” The smoke engulfed him; he
                            did not know what it was. He said it felt like “a sledge hammer.” He was
                            hit by rocks and soot and it was black as night. Breathing became
                            difficult and everything was covered with gray cement. Someone said the
                            tower fell. He went back to the building and tried to get people off the
                            street. He was outside again when the second tower fell and another
                            black wall came down the street. It was “gritty, dirty and dark and
                            stuff was flying around in the air.” When he went back into the building
                            people were beginning to panic. He had spoken to a few policemen and
                            knew the area had been sealed off and the ferries and subways were
                            closed. People were crying. He tried to calm people by telling them they
                            had food and water in the building, and there was no way to leave the
                            city. The television was still working and added to the trauma with the
                            news playing the scene over and over again. He was worried about his
                            family and discovered one phone line in his office still working. He
                            called his wife and told her he was ok and did not know when he would be
                            home. Robert periodically sent security officers out into the street to
                            assess the situation and get information. By mid afternoon, he was told
                            the Staten Island Ferry and Brooklyn Bridge were going to open as soon
                            as they were deemed “safe.” He sent a few security officers with small
                            groups to the ferry and the bridge until only he and his fellow security
                            workers were left. He stayed four days in order to secure all the JP
                            Morgan buildings and was sent home for a few hours only to return later
                            that day. He walked from Wall Street to 34th Street to Penn Station to
                            get home. During his four days in the building, Robert made sure the
                            premises were secure and arranged for food and water to be brought in.
                            He walked to the pile and was approximately 150-200 yards from the
                            towers. He was amazed that 200 stories became 3-4 stories high and that
                            concrete, glass, computers had vaporized. Robert credits his upbringing
                            and his religious beliefs for his ability to cope with the stress of the
                            attacks. He was unconcerned with his own safety, and his number one
                            priority was to protect the people wandering in the street. He does not
                            feel like a hero; he was only doing what he was trained to do. He
                            believes the heroes were the ones in the immediate area. “Not just the
                            first responders, all the people in the area.” The scariest part of the
                            event was when he saw a US military tank riding down Wall Street with a
                            soldier manning the turret. It took one to two weeks for the buildings
                            to reopen. The soot had to be cleaned and the rooftops checked for human
                            remains. “Secure zones” in the buildings were created for people to
                            work. It was difficult for employees to return to work and those on the
                            upper floors were afraid. Robert said it took a long time for all
                            personnel, including security, to feel safe. Robert became more
                            understanding after the event because he saw all people helping and
                            coming together. The event made him respect life a little more. He fears
                            that the feeling will fade the further we get from 9/11. He believes the
                            event happened because of our way of life and freedoms, and we cannot
                            allow anybody, anywhere to take them from us. Robert hopes in the future
                            that people learn that, “freedom cannot be infringed upon” and people
                            should not try to impose their will on others. He said, “as long as
                            civilized people have love and morals, there is hope.” He hopes people
                            will “never forget.”

       Albert was an NYPD detective on 9/11. After learning of the attacks, he
                            drove to his office at the 75th precinct in Brooklyn, where he was told
                            to stay put. The policemen stood on the roof of the precinct and watched
                            the towers burn. On 9/13/01, he volunteered to go to the Freshkills
                            landfill, which he described as disorganized. He had only a paper mask
                            and a Tyvek suit. His job was to try to locate human remains. He was at
                            the site for only one day and was sent back to the 75th precinct to his
                            regular job. Albert grew tired of sitting in the office watching TV. He
                            volunteered to go to the morgue. On 9/18/01, he was assigned to mortuary
                            operations. His duties were fingerprinting remains for six days a week,
                            12 hours a day. He learned the different ways in which fingerprinting
                            was done depending on the condition of the finger. Eventually there were
                            too many officers assigned to fingerprinting. He asked what else he
                            could do and was assigned to the triage area in the morgue where bodies
                            were sent for identification. At this area, body parts were removed from
                            bags, labeled and separated to try to get a positive identification.
                            Because many of the remains had no face; it helped him stay detached. He
                            said the process evolved and became more efficient each day. The area
                            was a “no camera zone” and the remains were treated with the utmost
                            respect, however, he regrets that the process (not the remains) was not
                            filmed for use at a future disaster. A team of experts in the fields of
                            victim identification and mortuary services called DMORT (Disaster
                            Mortuary Operational Response Team) arrived to provide assistance. After
                            the separation of remains, the medical examiner would attempt an autopsy
                            to extract DNA. There were 26 refrigerated trailers to hold the remains.
                            If identified, the remains would be released to the family. He described
                            the group at the morgue as cohesive, and they would vent to each other.
                            Albert worked there from 4PM to 4 AM for 70 days. He felt he had a
                            mission. He would go home after his shift and sleep, wake up, and return
                            to work. He was barely home, and when he was, he became “robotic.” The
                            volume at the morgue began to decrease. On 11/11/01, a plane crashed in
                            the Rockaways (255 people, died according to Albert) and he processed
                            these bodies as well. He described this tragedy as more difficult, as
                            there were many children in the crash and everyone had a face. He was
                            assigned to work at the Fresh Kills landfill after his work at the
                            morgue and did 12 tours there until he retired in January of 2002. The
                            landfill had changed since he was there on 9/13/01, and was now dirt.
                            His work at the morgue helped him identify remains at the landfill. He
                            said that by this point he knew what he was looking for. The process was
                            very difficult; sometimes a firefighter would have other firemen’s gear
                            on, making it hard to make an identification.

       John was in the FDNY for 34 years. He retired as a captain in February
                            2002. He has two sons, one a NYC firefighter and the other NYPD. John
                            said it took him most of the day to get to Ground Zero. He led 20 heavy
                            rescue vehicles to the site on 9/11 at about 4 PM, going over the
                            Brooklyn Bridge into the darkness. You could not see lower Manhattan as
                            it was shrouded in dust. He helped set up lights for triage and headed
                            for the pile and began to dig. He described the atmosphere that day on
                            the pile as very quiet--everyone was on their hands and knees. He was
                            taken aback at the scope of the destruction and was in disbelief but
                            felt prepared due to his many years of training in the FDNY. John did
                            not sleep for 30+ hours after arriving there. He spent three months at
                            the site and said “very few bodies were found intact.” He found many
                            shoes with feet in them and could not understand where the rest of the
                            body was. He said after a few days you only needed your sense of smell
                            to locate bodies. He said, “it felt like a reward when remains were
                            found.” He described 6-7 stories of flooring compacted into about a
                            foot. On the pile, there was dust, instability, smoke and remains. There
                            was “some danger in everything you did.” For the first few days he said
                            it was the most organized chaos he had ever seen. Only paper masks were
                            used for the first two weeks before the FDNY were given respirators. He
                            described the respirators as uncomfortable and ineffective because they
                            did not have the proper filters, etc. He did expect side effects from
                            the air but rescue and recovery were his main concerns. John was unable
                            to go to many funerals. He thought his time would be better spent on the
                            pile. Psychologically he could not do both. He found the most difficult
                            part of his time on the pile was not being able to find a whole body. He
                            does not view the world any more dangerous than it was on 9/10/01, but
                            before the attack, he was a little more forgiving. He believes there
                            have been no major changes that will prevent another 9/11. “It is when,
                            not if, we will get hit again.” He does not feel like a hero and
                            believes that he “did the right thing and did his job.” He feels the
                            people lost in the attack were the “heroes.” John was diagnosed with
                            pulmonary fibrosis in 2007. If an event like this were to happen again,
                            he would love to say no, but feels he could not, and would do it again.
                            He sees no positives in this disaster. He said we will put up our
                            monuments but “most people will forget—it is human nature.” He is
                            disillusioned and does not have a lot of faith in mankind. He believes
                            there is little support for 9/11 issues and is hoping there is enough
                            support to the Zadroga Bill passed.

       Mindy worked for the NYPD in Manhattan criminal court on 9/11/01. On the
                            morning of 9/11, she was at her dentist’s office across the street from
                            the World Trade Center when the planes hit the buildings. She went to
                            the window and saw the silhouette of the plane in the tower. She
                            returned to her office in the criminal court building, and because of
                            the uncertainty of the situation, she brought about five or six
                            prisoners uptown to the 17th precinct in a paddywagon. As she was
                            driving uptown, she saw people running and crying like in a “King Kong
                            movie". She arrived back at the courthouse at about 7 PM, drove to her
                            home in Levittown, slept for a few hours, and returned to the
                            courthouse. The Manhattan criminal court building was in the “red zone”
                            and was about five minutes from Ground Zero. Mindy walked to the site
                            and described the scene as “The most devastating thing I ever saw in my
                            life.” She spoke of the sadness and the quiet—“You could hear a pin
                            drop.” She was assigned to the pile and was about 15 stories up on the
                            bucket brigade. She went under beams looking for survivors and could
                            feel the heat rising and smell the bodies. Mindy was at the site every
                            day, alternating between the morgue and the pile. At the morgue, she was
                            responsible for vouchering bodies and property—keys, wallets, etc. The
                            enormity of the event hit her when she saw the thousands of pictures of
                            victims in the morgue. After clean up at the site was complete, Mindy
                            was assigned to the perimeter, where she did security. People came and
                            said they could “feel souls” there. The event changed her spiritually
                            and she said “you can feel it in you all the time.” She did not attend
                            any funerals, but instead went to St. Paul’s Chapel which she described
                            as “warm and comforting.” She felt there was something magical about
                            that church. Since 9/11, Mindy has had breast and thyroid cancer and has
                            learned to take one day at a time. The event has raised her good
                            thoughts about society, made communities come together, and renewed her
                            faith in people. She would do the same thing again if needed but would
                            not go without a mask.

       Richard was working as a Nassau County Police Officer in the Emergency
                            Medical Services unit on 9/11/2001. He saw the planes hit the Twin
                            Towers while watching television at home. He reported to the Bellmore,
                            Nassau County Police Department. Richard and his fellow E.M.S. officers
                            were escorted to Floyd Bennett Field where they mobilized equipment such
                            as hard hats, work gloves, gun belts, and heavy extrication tools such
                            as ropes, and sledgehammers. Richard and his unit were taken by bus down
                            to Stuyvesant High School in the city, which was the main staging area
                            for all E.M.S. workers. At about 11 p.m. on 9-11-2001 they arrived at
                            Ground Zero carrying their equipment and tools on shopping carts.
                            Richard started working with the bucket brigade, and then delved into
                            rescue work by searching through crevices in piles of debris. Richard
                            and other NYPD officers rescued a fellow officer named John who was
                            trapped under the debris. The rescue operation went on from 3:30 to 6:30
                            a.m. on 9/12/2001. He also lost a fellow officer, Ronnie, at the WTC
                            site. Richard continued to work for two weeks after 9/11, until the
                            rescue efforts ended and turned to one of recovery and clean-up. Richard
                            mentioned that the rescue and recovery efforts were possible only due to
                            the efforts of ironworkers, heavy equipment operators, and the teamwork
                            between police officers and firefighters. He hopes people don’t forget
                            about 9/11, and believes his experience at the site made him spiritual.
                            He now attends Sunday mass to remember Ronnie and pray for his son, who
                            serves as a Marine in Afghanistan.

       Robert was a teamster in Local 282 who operated heavy equipment and did
                            road work. on 9/11, Robert was working in Montauk, NY, repaving about 30
                            miles of road. He went to a deli during his morning break and it was
                            there he heard of the attacks. The job in Montauk was shut down early.
                            He remembered his son was on his boat somewhere off City Island, and so
                            he focused on getting to the Bronx to make sure his son was safe.
                            Because of road closures and security, it took him from 10 AM to 1 AM on
                            9/12/01 to reach the Bronx. On 9/12/01, he drove his employer’s truck
                            into the city to try and reach the site. He was unable to get there
                            until a day or two later due to all the chaos blocking the area-- fire
                            trucks, equipment, and dazed people. Robert was not upset or anxious
                            about going to Ground Zero, as he is an experienced diver (has done
                            diving for the police) and former volunteer firefighter who has
                            witnessed many accidents and deaths. Robert operated a dump truck on the
                            pile, and his job for the first few weeks after the attack was to bring
                            debris to the Staten Island landfill. At that time, there were no rules
                            and regulations and the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel was closed except for
                            trucks. After a few weeks, the site became more organized and the debris
                            was removed by barge. He didn’t like the bureaucracy at the site as time
                            went on. Truckers were given tickets, etc. He was unable to wear any
                            safety equipment because it blocked his vision while backing up into a
                            hole and he feared he would run someone over. Memories that stayed with
                            him are the fires that burned for close to a year and witnessing the
                            discovery of body parts. He worked 12 hours a day and stayed and the
                            Marriott Hotel. He remained at Ground Zero for approximately two years.
                            Robert is unsure why he is not sick after spending so much time at the
                            site. He went to bars at night with his coworkers and thinks perhaps all
                            the alcohol he consumed protected him from becoming sick. He did not
                            talk about the event with his family and friends--he is able to let
                            things go and is not haunted by the event. He just tries not to think
                            about it. When he slept at the Marriott, every morning he awoke to a
                            small stuffed animal. He recycled the stuffed animals by throwing them
                            out of his truck at children near the site. Cards poured in from all
                            over the world stating the responders were heroes and thanking them for
                            their efforts. he recalls the movie stars who helped serve food and he
                            appreciated the “Spirit of America” ship that provided medical help and
                            food. He felt these things helped the morale of the responders. 9/11
                            made him appreciate living in the United States, and he hopes more
                            people appreciate what they have. He thinks it’s the “big guys” that
                            create these problems but they are not the people who end up in the
                            graveyard. Robert is retired from the Teamsters and drives a school bus
                            as of this date.

       Joseph is currently Executive Director for the Institute for Rational
                            Counseling, and served as an early intervention unit specialist for the
                            NYPD after 9/11. After that, he started working as a psychiatric social
                            worker for the County of Suffolk Law Enforcement Agency and was also an
                            associate dean of students at Southampton College. On 9/11, Joseph was
                            sitting in a living room with a patient during a home visit and saw the
                            planes strike the Twin Towers on TV. Two of Joseph’s sons worked as
                            police officers in the city and his third son was an ironworker. After
                            the incident, he closed his office and contacted his sons, finding out
                            that both of his sons had not gone to work that day. Then, he got a call
                            from the early intervention program to come into work. Joseph mentions
                            he was stopped at the entrance of the Long Island Expressway by a police
                            car and asked to provide identification. He recalls that it was
                            “surreal” as there were no cars on the expressway. He drove through the
                            Midtown Tunnel to the 1st precinct. He says, “I remember ash in the air,
                            I remember it bothering my eyes.” He remembers walking to the site and
                            said, “I’ve never been exposed to anything like that before.” He worked
                            with police officers at the NYC morgue and property bureau, and by the
                            Staten Island landfill with police officers who sifted through debris to
                            recover body parts. He worked as part of the early intervention unit
                            through December 2001, and also facilitated debriefing sessions for
                            police officers who worked at the WTC site. Joseph believes the police
                            response should be lauded as they responded to a “war scene.” He also
                            worked with the property bureau, cataloging bone fragments and worked
                            with police officers who experienced trauma. Joseph was “very much into
                            rolling up his sleeves and getting involved.” He said he worked at the
                            site because two of his sons worked for the NYPD and he was, “happy to
                            be there for them.” He also mentioned that the fire department did not
                            have anybody of equal caliber to assist with debriefing firefighters,
                            and that this was surprising as the FD lost nearly a tenth of their
                            force in the World Trade Center attacks. Joseph mentioned how very
                            accommodating NYC hotels were to firefighters and police officers,
                            giving them a place to stay, since many times they couldn’t go home
                            between shifts. He said the people who coped better were those who had
                            realistic expectations, and he noticed that those who suffered the most
                            had unrealistically driven guilt as if “they could handle anything.” He
                            said that the first six weeks at the pile were “absolutely surrealistic
                            for anyone down there,” but noted that everybody had an incredible sense
                            of purpose for their work. Joseph said it made him very proud of his
                            sons’ choice to be police officers. He notes that for many police
                            officers, there was some resistance at home, as families often asked why
                            they were down at the site. Joseph talks a little about the debriefing
                            process and explains that debriefing is an educational tool to help
                            responders understand what their experience was about, what sorts of
                            reactions they might have, and where to go for help if their symptoms
                            get out of control. He commends the efforts of Commissioner Ray Kelly
                            and Chief Esposito for telling responders to get treatment if needed. He
                            says his experience of working with these responders makes him aware of
                            the importance of “here and now.” Joseph says this experience made him
                            more dedicated to his patients. For the future, Joseph hopes that the
                            memory of 9/11 is preserved well for future generations, and will help
                            people realize that “Human beings can rise to significant heights when
                            faced with overwhelming disaster."

       Kevin has worked as a police officer for NYC for the past 17 years. On
                            the morning of 9/11, he was listening to the radio at home and heard of
                            the plane crashes. He called work and was told to come in. He recalls
                            that traffic on the Meadowbrook was closed to all traffic except for
                            first responders. He raced to his work site in Jamaica in the warrant
                            unit. He was told to “suit up” along with co-workers and head to
                            Chambers Street to begin search and rescue. He recalls going into
                            Building Five, walking into the darkness, over debris and smoldering
                            piles, feeling around for anything. He stated that shortly after leaving
                            this building, it collapsed. He remembers always waiting for
                            instructions on where to go next and being anxious about not doing
                            enough. His main motivation to keep going was to find someone alive, but
                            he never did. He said his frustration was shared with a group of search
                            and rescue German Shepherds that were brought in. The dogs would get
                            frustrated and suffer from depression because they too, could not find
                            anyone. After a while, responders would be deliberately placed under
                            debris so the dogs would be able to find them and get rejuvenated by
                            their efforts. Kevin stated that he was always moving closer to Ground
                            Zero in the hopes of finding someone, but he never did. In the beginning
                            he worked 16 hour shifts and eventually went to 12 hour shifts. He
                            worked on the bucket brigade a few times and remembers that one of the
                            buildings was nicknamed “Pringles” because it was standing like a potato
                            chip. He recalls being knee deep in debris on Broadway and says it was
                            always “surreal, like a movie scene”. He remembers the Greek priest that
                            he escorted in and out of Ground Zero so that he could say prayers with
                            groups of people. He recalls taking a picture of a construction worker
                            wearing a bandana and the raising of a flag as everyone saluted it, and
                            the emotions that followed.

       Edward is a NYC Department of Transportation worker with 26 years of
                            service. On 9/11, he was working in his present job and had taken an
                            annual day off from work to go fishing on the Jersey Shore with his
                            friend Tommy. They heard over 1010 Wins about a plane that hit the
                            towers, and when they stopped to take out their binoculars, they saw the
                            second plane hit the tower. Right away, he thought “We're under attack.”
                            He rushed home via Ocean Parkway over the Robert Moses Bridge and went
                            to work. He remembers there was mandatory overtime and everyone was on
                            emergency standby. After his shift, he packed his gloves, vest, and
                            helmet and proceeded to the site. He remembers, “I couldn’t breathe, my
                            nose was clogged, my eyes were burning.” He got an id tag and walked
                            four blocks to the site. He said, “Standing there, I thought I was on
                            another planet.” He was ready to jump in and do anything and so went
                            around asking cops, ironworkers and firemen what he could do. He was
                            amazed at how people came together “naturally” and how people
                            concentrated on what they did. He remembers, “It didn’t matter whether
                            you had a uniform on…there was no rank,” and that it was different from
                            standard New York attitudes. He worked on the bucket brigade as a
                            volunteer, leaving his job at 5:30 PM and driving into the city to
                            volunteer from 6:30 PM to 2 A.M. He recalls that “There was no night or
                            day.” He got fatigued by working there. He gradually accepted that they
                            wouldn’t find survivors and did not go into detail about work at the
                            site. When he came home he couldn’t eat his supper, and couldn’t explain
                            to his wife or kids what he heard or saw. He says however that he would
                            do this experience again as “It was a good feeling knowing you’re trying
                            to make a difference in this world.”

       Anthony was a sergeant in the NYPD. He was at his Brooklyn precinct on
                            9-11-2001, and heard transmission over the radio about the towers being
                            attacked. He actually saw the second plane hit the tower. He asked his
                            superior at the precinct if he could take 10-15 officers to help out at
                            the site, but he was required to secure the perimeter around his
                            precinct first. He remembers that he wanted very much to be at the site
                            rescuing people, and states, “We were (all) there for that…we had an
                            army.” Anthony went to Ground Zero the next day. All parkways were
                            closed on 9-12-2001 and travel to his precinct was quick. He proceeded
                            to start working twelve hour shifts, from 6 a.m. to 6p.m. He remembers
                            that all roadways south of Canal Street were closed to traffic, and that
                            there were dust plumes in the air and people’s faces were pasted with
                            soot and dust. He said the main danger for responders at the time was
                            loose debris, and not toxins. Anthony was also in law school at this
                            time, and mentions how he had to juggle his work as a sergeant, his
                            family commitments, and school. He attended about 10-15 funerals. Two of
                            his close buddies in the Emergency Services Unit passed away. Anthony
                            describes the police officer funerals in detail, and said afterwards
                            that the experience was both desensitizing and patriotic. Anthony states
                            for the most part he does not feel he did anything heroic at the site,
                            but “Those people who went above and beyond the call of duty deserve to
                            be called heroes.”

       John was a police officer in Rochester, New York on 9-11-2001. He was
                            driving alone in his patrol car, when he heard on the radio that the
                            World Trade Center Tower was hit by a plane. He went to his headquarters
                            and asked to sign up on a waitlist to see if they needed responders at
                            the site. He had also previously worked in the NYPD for 6 years, and
                            called up his former partner, John, in Brooklyn to see if they needed
                            help. He took vacation time and traveled 5 ½ hours down to Manhattan to
                            see if he could help. As he approached the Westside Highway, he recalled
                            smelling burning flesh. John went to the Javits Center and was bussed to
                            the site with a group of NYPD officers from the Manhattan area. He says
                            he was the odd in his Rochester Police uniform. He came into the site
                            through Vesey Street and recalled seeing just rubble, smoke, and
                            dust—and had only a painter’s mask on. He felt it was unorganized that
                            first day, and relied mostly on Lieutenant Ortiz, who took roll call and
                            delegated tasks to other responders. John worked on the bucket brigade
                            and was told to tag body parts or “anything of substantial value”. He
                            had never done anything like that before, but still felt it was part of
                            his job. He stayed at the site for 15-16 hours, and by the end of the
                            day drove back to Long Island with his former NYPD partner to get some
                            rest. He slept for 3-4 hours and drove back to the Brooklyn precinct and
                            was taken again to the Vesey Street area. He recalls how female officers
                            were more expressive with their emotions than male officers, but how
                            everyone comforted each other when needed. He felt the second day was
                            more organized than the first and by the third day they had organized
                            trucks bringing in blue jeans and Timberland boots that responders could
                            use and dispose of. He recalls that he never ate so many granola bars in
                            his life. For bathrooms they had port-a-potties and resources got better
                            as time went on. His friend Paul from upstate New York also managed to
                            arrange rooms at upscale New York hotels after working at the site. John
                            recalls that this experience was tough on his family and his wife would
                            ask him why he volunteered. He remembers that around two months after
                            this experience he received a magazine in the mail that had pictures of
                            responders who died on 9-11, and this made him breakdown a little bit.
                            His wife was there to comfort him, and sometimes his kids still ask
                            questions. He also mentioned that he had brought a disposable camera
                            with him to take some pictures of the site, and has some pictures
                            mounted on his wall at home. He feels the positives to come out of this
                            tragedy was that people learned to work together in times of crisis.

       Greta is the widow of Robert (Rob) who was a police officer. They were
                            married in 1998 and had 2 children. Greta stated that her husband loved
                            his job and followed in his father’s footsteps. They both grew up in
                            Merrick, Long Island and met in their late 20s. Robert graduated from
                            the police academy in 1995 and was assigned to the medical division in
                            Queens. Greta was a buyer for Fortunoff's (she has worked as a buyer for
                            20 years and has travelled to many places around the world). At the time
                            of 9/11, they were young and just starting their lives and planning for
                            the future. That morning, they were on vacation in Canada and Greta was
                            pregnant with their first child. When they heard the news, Rob
                            immediately said, “We have to go back”. There was no convincing him to
                            remain on vacation. They drove all night, approximately 10 hours to get
                            home. Greta stated that even in Canada things were shut down because no
                            one exactly knew what had happened. They drove in silent shock pretty
                            much the entire ride home. Rob left for work as soon as they got back
                            home and he was assigned to the security perimeter at the WTC. The next
                            few months were a blur; at times Rob slept at work, and when home, he
                            didn’t talk much about what was happening. Their first child, a son, was
                            born in March, just a few months after 9/11. Greta states that Rob had
                            changed. He began to lose weight, slept a lot, and was just “never quite
                            right”. He always had dark circles under his eyes and despite several
                            doctor visits and tests, nothing was diagnosed except anemia. By the
                            time they finally discovered that he had a rare form of intestinal
                            cancer, it was stage 4 and incurable. He had a series of operations and
                            lengthy hospital stays trying to prolong his life but nothing worked.
                            She watched her husband wither from 180 pounds to under 100 before he
                            passed away. Her daughter, their 2nd child, was only 3 when Rob passed
                            away. Greta states that it was difficult having 2 children but she had
                            support from friends and neighbors. Her father had been a deacon and
                            they had a lot of people from the church that were available to help as
                            well. Greta states that her husband was proud of what he did and his
                            contribution to 9/11. She uses the word "hero" only when speaking to her
                            children about her their father, otherwise, she said that Rob, like many
                            others, was just doing his job didn't consider himself to be a hero.
                            They had no regrets but did ask why. They were young, newly married and
                            just starting out in life. They had so little time together. Greta is
                            sometimes angry but mostly accepting, doing what she needs to do to keep
                            her family together. Greta says that life can be very lonely, but she
                            has bonded with others in similar situations and has recently joined
                            John Feal in creating a project for 9/11 responders and their families.
                            She has also been to Washington to speak on the healthcare bill and to
                            help keep the memories alive. She is and will always be proud of her
                            husband and what he did and will kept telling her story. She will ‘never
                            forget’ and she wants others to do the same.

       Jim moved to Long Island in 1985 from the island of Jamaica. He became a
                            volunteer firefighter because he wanted to serve his community, and
                            later became an EMT as well. He is married and has 2 grown sons. At the
                            time of 9/11, he was living in Bellport and said that there was a great
                            ‘sense of community’ in the area. Jim managed the fire alarm systems at
                            Brookhaven National Labs and also did fire rescue training at the fire
                            academy. On 9/11, Jim was at work at Brookhaven Labs. He heard what
                            happened on the news but wasn’t sure what had really happened until the
                            2nd plane hit. Then he knew it was an act of terrorism. He and his
                            co-workers, other volunteer firefighters, wanted to go to the site
                            immediately. Jim was the 2nd assistant chief at the time at the
                            Brookhaven firehouse. He had to follow the rules and procedures and was
                            told that he and his co-workers could not go, so he and 5 of his
                            co-workers sat and waited. On 9/12, Jim and some of his co-workers
                            realized that one of their team was missing. His name was Link and he
                            was Jim’s best friend and like a brother. They called his home and were
                            told by his wife that Link went to work. It only took a few minutes for
                            them to realize that Link went on his own to the World Trade Center
                            site. So at that moment, tired of waiting for orders, Jim and 4 others
                            gathered some gear, piled into one car and headed into the city. They
                            didn’t care what happened to them, they only knew they had to go and
                            find their brother. Jim told his wife and sons that they were leaving,
                            that they had to do what they had to do. Since they had identification
                            as firefighters, they weren’t questioned on the way into the city. His
                            co-worker, nicknamed Chicken Legs, drove the car on the expressway and
                            they headed to Ladder 24 in midtown. They picked up more gear, drove as
                            close as they could and then walked to the site. When they arrived at
                            the site, Jim couldn’t believe the scene. He said he will never forget
                            the vision of no color, only gray dust. Street signs couldn’t be read
                            but because he knew the city, he guided the others in. As they
                            approached the site it started raining. They saw lights and the skeleton
                            of buildings. He said, “Wow, how could this happen? Why would anyone
                            want to bring a giant to its knees?" This made him angry. They went to
                            Engine 10 at the base of the WTC, where they were welcomed and sent to
                            work on the pile. Once there, they tried to figure out where their
                            friend might be. They said that Link would go to where the action was,
                            probably at the top of the building. Since the building had collapsed,
                            they started looking through the smoldering rubble at the base of one of
                            the towers. They wedged in between and through any openings they could
                            find. Jim said they were like gophers and moles just crawling and
                            winding their way through any hole going further into the rubble trying
                            to find Link. After many hours and finding nothing, they came out. They
                            were wet, dirty, and tired but then found dry clothes and food. Jim and
                            another co-worker nicknamed Maggot worked on the bucket brigade for a
                            few days. He said it was organized chaos on the pile--manual labor
                            searching for anything, sifting for life. After a week, Jim and his
                            co-workers had to leave. Since they were technically never officially
                            sent there to work, they were not getting paid from their regular jobs.
                            He said it was heartbreaking to leave without having found his friend or
                            anyone else. They headed home. Jim had helped Link get certified in
                            scuba diving. Their plan was to eventually open a scuba/dive shop in the
                            Cayman Islands when they retired. Link got his nickname because he
                            always wore shorts no matter how cold out it was and he had skinny legs
                            like links. A month after 9/11, another group of firefighters found
                            Link. In memory of his fallen brother, Jim wears shorts to all events
                            now and has a beer in honor of his friend. Jim said lessons learned are
                            to be aware and cautious, that we are vulnerable. He also said that
                            terrorists should know that we are one nation under God, we are a strong
                            nation, we will prevail and we will fight for our freedom.

       Thomas is a 37-year old disabled NYPD detective retired since March 2010
                            due to his 9/11 injuries. He worked at the 106th Precinct in Ozone Park,
                            Queens, and also worked for the anti-crime unit investigating violent
                            felonies, street crimes, and doing undercover work. He had worked the
                            evening of 9/10 and was home on the morning of 9/11, when he received a
                            phone call from his aunt asking him to try and locate his uncle, a
                            senior vice president at Marsh and McLennan. Thomas felt unaffected
                            emotionally and went into “fight or flight” mode, packed up some clothes
                            and raced to his precinct in Queens. He said he could see the smoke from
                            the Southern State Parkway as he was driving into the city and it was
                            “eerily” quiet. When he arrived at the precinct it was “utter chaos.”
                            Eventually groups were organized to go to Ground Zero. Later that day,
                            he travelled on a city bus to the site and saw crowds walking out of
                            Manhattan. He travelled with about 40 cops on the bus and said it was
                            “dead quiet.” Thomas had previously witnessed gruesome sights, but
                            nothing compared to this disaster: “No one could have been prepared for
                            this.” He described the site when he first arrived as very disorganized
                            with poor visibility, debris everywhere, and it was getting dark. Thomas
                            went to Deutsche Bank where there was a temporary morgue and unzipped
                            the body bags to try and locate his uncle. Outside of the morgue there
                            was a big box of wallets with credit cards, etc. and pocketbooks. It was
                            then that the gravity of the situation hit him. He was at Ground Zero
                            for about 2-3 days straight and spent time on the bucket brigade. The
                            smells were distinctive—flesh, human hair, and plastic. He called his
                            aunt and told her what he knew. He hung a picture of his uncle in the
                            hospital, even though he knew it was fruitless since his uncle was on
                            one of the higher floors in the Trade Center. He witnessed fights
                            between firemen and the NYPD and met with an officer he went to the
                            academy with who was posted in front of four refrigerator trucks whose
                            job it was to log in body parts. “We were all like zombies,” he said.
                            His eyes, nose, and mouth were constantly filled with dust. He felt numb
                            the whole time and was frustrated with the lack of urgency, but now
                            understands why. He does not feel like a hero, he was just doing his
                            job. After the event, Thomas was proud to be a NYC police officer. One
                            month after 9/11 his family had a memorial for his uncle. A year later,
                            two state troopers and a priest knocked on his aunt’s door with a one
                            centimeter piece of bone. He described that as a setback for his aunt
                            and his family since they were just beginning to recover from the
                            passing of his uncle. Thomas knew two police officers and three firemen
                            killed in the attacks. He tried to go to as many funerals as he could
                            and tried not to become emotional. The whole event did not hit him until
                            about five years after 9/11. He had delayed feelings and couldn’t talk
                            about it for the first five years but now he finally can. He said media
                            images trigger it and “it seems like everyone forgets.” Thomas thinks we
                            have to look out and protect ourselves and be vigilant because they are
                            “going to get us again.” He had no protection for the first three days
                            at Ground Zero and received only a paper mask on the fourth day. A week
                            later respirators were given to only lieutenants and higher ranking
                            personnel. He did, however, mention at the end of his interview that he
                            spent some time at the landfill where he was provided with a Tyvek suit
                            and a respirator. He got the “9/11 cough" and now suffers from COPD,
                            asthma, and rhinitis. He feels no one had the right protection and the
                            event was very costly to him. He is disappointed that the event ruined
                            his good career. He can no longer physically do his job and became out
                            of breath just teaching his daughter how to ride a bike. Thomas
                            originally wanted to be an architect but chose to be a police officer in
                            order to help people. He loves to cook and is now pursuing a career as a
                            chef.

       On 9/11 Hadyn was a rookie for the NYPD at the 111th Precinct in Bayside,
                            Queens. He had graduated from the Police Academy at age 25 in June of
                            2001. He was home on the morning of the attacks and saw the event unfold
                            on TV. His initial reaction was shock. Hadyn was called to work on 9/11
                            and was assigned to an entrance ramp on the LIE to check IDs and make
                            sure only authorized personnel were driving on the LIE. He was on the
                            ramp alone from noon to about midnight until someone came and picked him
                            up. He arrived at Ground Zero on 9/13/01 and didn’t know what to
                            expect—he was scared. He travelled on an MTA bus and said it was quiet
                            on the bus and he could see a “big cloud” over downtown. The bus took
                            him near the Brooklyn Bridge which he described as a “ghost town, like
                            something out of a movie.” He had a paper mask and he could only see a
                            few feet in front of him. There were no civilians there, just policemen,
                            FDNY, and the military. He did 12-hour shifts at the Federal Reserve
                            Bank and for about 2-3 months he was assigned to perimeter security.
                            Once he arrived at the site, his fear vanished. He saw the pile—a mound
                            of metal stories high. It was like nothing he’d ever seen before. He
                            worked for two weeks straight, getting only about four hours of sleep a
                            night. He thought people were on edge. A childhood friend named Deborah
                            was missing, and he later found out she had been killed in the attacks.
                            He volunteered on the bucket brigade because he felt the need to help,
                            but only did it twice. He did not see any body parts, but did see
                            families sitting waiting for the recovery of a body. Haydn was angry
                            about the attacks and had a hatred of the terrorists. He was frustrated
                            that the terrorists had no rules, yet we did. As a rookie, he said the
                            attacks had a “desensitizing” effect on him. He never felt like a hero,
                            but the appreciation felt good. He would do it again and he was glad to
                            see the “community unity” and how the event brought people together. He
                            feels the feeling went away in a few months and “people had already
                            forgotten.” He says he definitely appreciates things more, and said you
                            “should take the opportunity when you have it-- it might not always be
                            there.”

       Danielle was a transformer mechanic for ConEd on 9/11. She was home that
                            morning and watched the events unfold on TV. She felt a “pulling” to go
                            to the site and drove there at 11PM that night. She did not know how to
                            get there, but just followed the smoke and the burning smell. When she
                            arrived at Ground Zero, she saw soot, smoke, and fires and said there
                            were “papers flying everywhere.” In the chaos, she didn’t know what to
                            do once she arrived. She left and returned with her video camera the
                            next morning, feeling the need to document the site. She saw firemen
                            sleeping in the street, and hoped to rescue someone. While on the bucket
                            brigade, she found an intact teddy bear in mounds of soot with the
                            inscription “Top of the World, World Trade Center, New York City.” She
                            brought the teddy bear, still covered in dust, to this interview.
                            Danielle says she was on a mission to help someone. She assisted some
                            nurses she met at McDonalds, which was set up as NYPD headquarters, to
                            set up supplies. The most difficult part for her is that after a few
                            days she wasn’t allowed to help. She does not feel like a “hero,” but
                            the event inspired her to join the volunteer fire department for five
                            years. Recently, Danielle went to the site and said it was very
                            emotional. “My life has been forever changed and the innocence is gone.
                            You don’t feel safe anymore.” She is now very suspicious of people and
                            finds it hard to trust others. She cherishes her family and doesn’t take
                            things for granted, and believes so many more people have been affected
                            by the attacks than just those who passed. She lives every day in their
                            honor. Danielle is haunted by the event and hopes that we never forget
                            all the lives that were affected. She believes we have to look at what
                            happened so we can make it better, and is proud to be an American.
                            Danielle stated she would do it again in a heartbeat, and that it was
                            painful not to go to Katrina. She has a compulsion to go to disasters to
                            help. As a result of the few days she spent at Ground Zero, she has
                            nasal problems, sleep apnea, and GERD. She is glad she came to the WTC
                            Program for help and feels she has been treated gently and with
                            compassion.

       Ronald was born in 1941 in the Bronx. He went to public school, worked
                            for Mad magazine, and then joined the Navy (1958-1962 on the U.S.S.
                            Canberra). He became a steamfitter apprentice in 1963 and worked in the
                            industry until his retirement in 2003. Ronald was working as a
                            steamfitter foreman on 9/11. He was in charge of twenty steamfitters
                            that day and had started work at 6:30 a.m. on one of the buildings in
                            the lower Manhattan area. He saw the first plane hit the tower, saw
                            flames and people leaping. Ronald saw the second plane hit the
                            tower--the plane’s engine fell by Church and Murray Street, hitting some
                            pedestrians on the street. He sent his workers home and started walk up
                            to West Broadway, and saw FBI agents who asked him where he was going.
                            They escorted him and four other steamfitters across the Brooklyn Bridge
                            from Manhattan. While they were on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway they
                            saw the towers fall. It took Ronald four hours to get to the LIE, and
                            when he got home his wife was still at work at Stony Brook University
                            Hospital (as it was turned into a triage center for WTC victims). He
                            remembers that he couldn’t sleep that night. On 9/12, Ronald decided to
                            volunteer and went by himself to the pier on the west side to meet up
                            with other steamfitters. They moved beams and columns and worked with
                            burning steel. Ronald recalls seeing human body parts fused in the steel
                            and remembers the fumes were outrageous—a combination of burning
                            plastic, paper, and human remains. He wore his own clothes, and
                            initially was given a paper mask and later a filtered breathing mask. He
                            worked for three days through 9-15-2001, and believes that his Navy
                            training prepared him for this kind of work. Ronald thinks everybody
                            should go into the service because it builds patriotic values and
                            “teaches you a different kind of discipline.” Ronald says that he became
                            more guarded and protective after 9/11. He believes that the WTC site is
                            sacred ground, and disagrees with the building of a mosque near the
                            site. He says, “you have to draw a radius and that radius is sacred.” He
                            also believes that this disaster led people to “listen to what other
                            people are saying.” He said, “The United States…cannot go back to the
                            way it was before 9-11…the world cannot be naïve.” His final message to
                            future audiences is, “please try to get along.”

       Terese was a licensed massage therapist who worked in Colorado in the
                            winter and in the Hamptons on Long Island in the summers. After the 9/11
                            attacks, she never returned to Colorado. On the morning of 9/11, she saw
                            the attacks on TV and was worried about her brothers, one a NYC fireman
                            and the other an electrician who was at the site. Her father is a
                            retired battalion chief for the FDNY. She knew she had to help, and so
                            she packed up her massage table and went to the site. She arrived at
                            Ground Zero and said it was “surreal—like being on a movie set.” All her
                            senses were heightened tenfold. She did not expect the devastation she
                            saw—the smells, smoke, and collapsed buildings. Men and women were
                            already on the pile; everyone pitched in to do something. Terese set up
                            on a corner for the first few days and treated workers. When the Spirit
                            of New York cruise ship arrived, she was assigned to a respite office
                            with chiropractors, physical therapists, and massage therapists. She
                            eventually became a Red Cross coordinator in charge of organizing
                            treatment by these specialists, and created a list of 400 chiropractors,
                            physical therapists, and massage therapists who volunteered to help. She
                            gave medical massages to treat responders' aches and pains, and give
                            them some relief so they could go back to the pile. Terese had an
                            emotional moment when describing how she was worried if she left the
                            site, she would not be able to get back in. A soldier she had given a
                            massage recognized her and gave her his badge since he would no longer
                            need it, he was heading off to Afghanistan. She described her time at
                            Ground Zero as a “city within a city” and generally had no idea if it
                            was day or night. During these months, she stayed with her brother in
                            Greenwich Village, as she was working 18 hours a day, 7 days a week
                            until November of 2001. She contracted a lung infection. The responders
                            called her group of professionals “the real heroes” and said they
                            couldn’t do what they did without their help. Terese saw the sadness and
                            devastation on their faces, and she made herself hold back her
                            emotions--they were all so thankful. Terese attended three funerals to
                            support her brother, but that was all she could take. She got up every
                            day because she knew the responders needed her help. She met a lot of
                            nice people at the site and received awards and letters although that is
                            not why she was there. She formed an instant bond with the people there
                            and would do it again even though she still has lasting effects. The
                            event didn’t hit her and her family until she left the site in November.
                            It took her about a year to get back to reality. Even nine years later,
                            she finds it hard to talk about. She had nothing left and was “empty
                            inside.” She is not the same person she was before the attacks. She does
                            not like crowds or trains, and takes martial arts in order to protect
                            herself. Terese found it hard to go back to regular work and could not
                            be in a small room. She had a cough and couldn’t breathe. She no longer
                            talks about the event. She believes “one person can make a difference”
                            and is very proud to be a part of the “most devastating, catastrophic
                            event in our history.” Terese is still a massage therapist and exercise
                            instructor.

       Gerard (Gerry) worked as an engineer for Lucent Technologies, installing
                            phone systems in offices. On 9/11, he was working from his home in
                            Pennsylvania, troubleshooting on the phone with co-workers at the phone
                            company’s central office on Vesey Street in Manhattan. He saw the planes
                            hit the towers on T.V. and was worried about his co-workers and told
                            them to get out of the area. On 9/12, Gerry called his boss and told him
                            he wanted to go to the Manhattan. He felt he could help as he knew that
                            area of the city. He took a rental car from Pennsylvania and crossed the
                            George Washington Bridge with the help of two state troopers. He was the
                            only person to cross the bridge and said it felt “spooky.” When he got
                            into the city, he remembers seeing the National Guard and recalls the
                            dust as a feeling of being “in a cloud within a cloud.” He got down to
                            the site around 2 p.m. and eventually got to the phone building. He
                            remembers that there was equipment hanging all over the place. He went
                            up to the 16th floor and looked out the south windows and could see the
                            Deutsche Bank---something he could’ve never seen before as the towers
                            would’ve blocked that view. He found it “mind boggling” how so much
                            debris from the towers ended up being such a “small hill.” Gerry worked
                            at the phone building assessing and recovering the status of two main
                            switches that funneled communications to the downtown area. He knew what
                            had to be done as he had 40 years of experience in his field. Battery
                            Park and Wall Street didn’t have phone systems and his job was to get
                            the two main switches up and running so that they could get back to work
                            again. Jerry describes some of the politics from higher-ups which made
                            it difficult for him to get the job done. He finally got both switches
                            up and running by the 18th of September, and mentioned he was just about
                            the only person who thought the switches were re-operable and not
                            defunct. He said, “Thankfully we had the right people” and he had
                            already worked with most of the other workers before. Gerry emphasized
                            the close-knit atmosphere and how well people worked with each other
                            without talking too much. He said that “Everybody worked together
                            regardless of trade…because everybody had one goal…to clean it up as
                            fast as we could.” Gerry worked at the WTC site restoring
                            telecommunications through early December 2001. He worked about 700
                            hours, and put in about a 16-20 hour day. He did not feel the effects of
                            his work until a year later, when he met with other responders for the
                            first reunion. He and other responders started having breathing
                            problems, and a constant cough “a.k.a. WTC cough.” He mentioned he used
                            to be an avid long distance runner, but after working at the site he
                            would get tired just walking to his car. Gerry is now focusing on
                            getting his health back, and is beginning to run again. He feels
                            disappointed with current politicians for not getting the 9/11 health
                            bill passed through the Senate. He says he would work again at the site
                            despite his health setbacks. He believes “Life is a circle” and that if
                            you help someone, you may receive help in return. His message to future
                            audiences is: “If you believe you can help, then do it” despite feeling
                            scared about your decision.

       Anthony was a carpenter on 9/11. He was on the Interboro Parkway and saw
                            one of the towers fall. He drove to the Red Cross office in Queens,
                            where he was informed that no volunteers were being accepted but that
                            they were taking volunteers in New Jersey. He went home and his wife
                            dropped him off at the Babylon train station. He travelled to New Jersey
                            to volunteer his help. They too said they didn’t need any volunteers,
                            but Anthony insisted he was not going home. He was assigned to loading
                            tugboats with food to be brought to Manhattan, and rode in one of the
                            boats across the Hudson to Manhattan. Anthony was amazed at the
                            destruction and said it was “like being in a war zone.” He saw people
                            cutting steel and digging in the pile. He got on the pile and began to
                            dig. At one point he fell and was taken to a triage center, where
                            someone from Russia gave him a coat. Anthony remembers being traumatized
                            by finding a glove with a hand in it, and at one point, he fell into a
                            torso. He lost a friend in the attacks, a firefighter, who was only
                            identified by his leg. Anthony says he was numbed out from this
                            experience and it was tough. He was on the bucket brigade for four
                            days—about 80 hours in total. He does not remember sleeping and was
                            exhausted and angry. He found some relief in a bar near the site
                            briefly. After four days, he had to get home to his family. He took the
                            train home which he said was like a “ghost town” and saw barricades with
                            soldiers. After the event, work slowed down in Manhattan and he was laid
                            off. He almost lost his house three times and it was hard to make ends
                            meet. He was helped by the WTC Program and the FealGood Foundation, who
                            he feels are like family. Anthony went to Washington, DC last week and
                            was amazed at the senators and disappointed in their response to 9/11.
                            In 2008 and 2009 he was in a major depression and drank a lot; he has
                            now been sober for ten months. He was always patriotic; his father is a
                            Vietnam Vet. He felt proud that he had helped. Patriotism and “just
                            being human” made him stay at Ground Zero. He is disappointed he did not
                            get to see George Bush at the site and is very upset that the US still
                            has not caught Osama bin Laden. He prays to calm down and is grateful he
                            is not as sick as others. He now has many health problems and is trying
                            to accept whatever happens. He does not need any more sadness in his
                            life. He has some peace from the WTC Program, the FealGood Foundation,
                            AA, and God. He is now not as scared and prays that everything will be
                            okay.

       Thomas was a union electrician working on the 22nd floor facing the North
                            Tower at the newly constructed Ritz Carlton in Battery Park on 9/11/01.
                            The Ritz was about two and a half blocks away from the World Trade
                            Center. At around 9:00 AM, he saw fire coming out of the North Tower.
                            Shortly after he heard a loud rumbling noise, “like a freight train” and
                            saw the second plane hit the South Tower. He saw a lot of people jumping
                            from the towers, and said “it looked like ragdolls falling out of a
                            building.” He was in shock. He rushed down the stairs and met at a
                            central location with other construction workers. Attendance was taken,
                            and he was told to leave and get out of the city. He had been a
                            volunteer firefighter for 20 years on Long Island and wanted to help but
                            since his wife was nine months pregnant and due any day, he decided to
                            go home. Thomas described the scene in the streets while trying to get
                            to a subway as “chaos.” He said he was a “wreck” by the time he reached
                            Penn Station, where he was waiting for a train home when it was
                            evacuated. He walked up to the street and received a phone call from his
                            brother-in-law who worked in Brooklyn. His brother in law told him to
                            come to his office, so he walked over the Brooklyn Bridge and safely
                            arrived there. He was happy he got out of the city. He got home to Long
                            Island at about 4:30 PM in his brother-in-law’s car via the
                            Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to the Long Island Expressway. When he
                            arrived at home, he watched the news, which he described as eerie, since
                            he had been so close to the towers at the time of the attacks. That
                            night he went to the Hauppauge Firehouse, where he was a volunteer, and
                            discovered two of their members were missing. One of the missing
                            firefighters was a very good friend. Both of these men were never found.
                            At the firehouse, they were asking for volunteers to go to Ground Zero.
                            Thomas did not go because of the imminent birth of his son, who was born
                            on 9/15/01. Two weeks later, he was sent back to work at the Ritz
                            Carlton. He said it “smelled like death” and described the building as
                            horrible--dust everywhere. Asbestos was found on one of the floors. He
                            only worked there for a few days before he was transferred to another
                            job on the Upper West Side. Thomas has a weird feeling at Ground Zero
                            and would not want to go back to rebuild the towers. He mentioned that
                            it is eerie that the Deutsche Bank Building is still there and needs to
                            be demolished. He remembers when the electricians used to look up at the
                            towers and discuss how the light bulb would be changed on the on the
                            antennae on the roof of one of the towers. He also remembers going to a
                            Christmas party at Windows on the World in December of 2000, the year
                            before the attacks. He remembers “every single aspect” of what happened
                            to him on 9/11/01. He is now working right next to Ground Zero and is
                            unhappy there. Even though the area has changed so much, he does not
                            want to be there. He has asked for a transfer as soon as possible. He
                            feels the event was the same as Pearl Harbor and thinks government and
                            society did what they thought was best.

       On 9/11 James was an unmarried NYPD captain and commanding officer for
                            Transit District 20 in Queens. That day, he had volunteered to be the
                            designated duty captain. His parents were traveling out of state so he
                            dropped them off at the airport, and then headed to his office to assume
                            his normal routine of grabbing some tea and reading crime reports. A
                            co-officer told him a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center, so
                            he went to the cafeteria to see it on TV. He remembered there were two
                            or three other cops around. His office was located underground and they
                            were only connected to a TV and a citywide radio. When James heard that
                            there was a Level 1 mobile alert, and that a second plane had hit, he
                            called up NYPD operations, as he knew his forces would be needed for
                            assistance. Then the mobile alert went up to level 4, and he started
                            calling in plainclothes officers, supervisors, and other “key people” to
                            get into uniform and come to the precinct. James followed a control and
                            mobilization plan. He had been captain for 3 years, and had never done
                            anything of this magnitude before. James and his team of fellow officers
                            took their bus into Manhattan around 9:30 that morning. His team
                            consisted of twenty cops, a lieutenant, and two sergeants. James
                            remembers that a “sense of a team” and being “part of a family” were the
                            main motivating forces for his response. The FBI office was down the
                            block and three agents asked for a ride with them. They also picked up
                            some firemen on the way down. James says that he saw the first tower
                            collapse and “the plume of smoke” as they were approaching the Midtown
                            tunnel. They parked by West Broadway and Canal Street and he gave his
                            team a pep talk. He remembers seeing a fire chief who was crying because
                            he thought his son was in one of the towers. The chief later found out
                            the son had survived. By now the city had been shut down except for
                            emergency vehicles, and James and his team set up a command post by
                            Building 7. He mentioned that he remembers thinking about what he was
                            breathing in. James related this experience to a memory his grandfather
                            related to him about being in a WWII bunker. James remained commanding
                            officer of his transit police all day deploying people to sensitive
                            locations such as schools, shopping centers, transit stations, and
                            highly populated areas. This was a disorder control plan to try to
                            control the fear of more targets in the city. The uncertainty was
                            psychologically and emotionally draining, and it showed when his men
                            went through debriefing. Later that afternoon, James took his car and
                            the bus back to his office in Queens, leaving his lieutenant in charge
                            at the site to keep track of the men and a log of where everyone was.
                            His job became mostly management of resources. He had time to catch his
                            breath and realize how overwhelming and surreal all of the day had been.
                            He decided now to work in two twelve hour shifts from four to four. He
                            dispatched cops arriving to the precinct to the site. Around one in the
                            morning, after all men were accounted for, he went to his parent’s house
                            to sleep, as it was closer than his own home on Long Island. That
                            morning, his parents had been on a plane that passed the towers at 8:30
                            and left the air space safely (which he found out earlier in the day).
                            James arose early the next day to a phone call from his cousin in
                            Denmark. In conversation he found that most of Europe thought all of New
                            York was gone. On day two, things started to feel more routine; plans
                            had been modified, and he knew his men were alright. He recalls that a
                            friend who owned a hotel in Queens reported two suspicious Middle
                            Eastern men there, and the FBI responded and took them away. James was
                            able to take a few days off at the end of October. He went to Washington
                            D.C. and the realization that this was a national and not just a New
                            York event became very apparent to him. The National Guard came to New
                            York to help mostly in the “frozen zone” which and was much needed, but
                            NYPD ran the show. Funerals were the hardest thing to attend. They made
                            the surreal real when you saw widows crying. James lost two people on
                            his list, and the NYPD lost 23 members--the full effect of this loss did
                            not hit him until he went to their funerals, which were in general
                            always fully attended by the force, but now the men were on the job and
                            few were able to be there. James regrets not attending his best friend’s
                            funeral; it was his only time off and he desperately needed to sleep. He
                            saw families' devastation of months of sacrifice, working fourteen hour
                            shifts. He unsuccessfully requested that his men be given time off to
                            rest but was denied, and felt angry at the police for not caring for the
                            physical and mental health of the men still working. A friend of his
                            attempted suicide shortly after retirement, suffering from exhaustion,
                            stress on the family, and a new baby to care for while his wife was at
                            work. He survived, but became blind from his injuries. James ended up
                            retiring a year later, and started giving lectures on 9/11. He married
                            at age 47 and now has a two year old. He realizes now how important
                            family is and asks his friends often about theirs. He has reprioritized
                            his life to "family first, work second." James says that sacrifices are
                            still being made, referring to mental and physical illnesses. He had to
                            be tougher then, but is more emotionally distressed now. The experience
                            impacted him strongly and he must talk about it. It has been ten years
                            now and the memories are carried with him. It's hard for him to watch
                            9/11-related TV shows and documentaries, and the presentations he gives
                            are hard to do. He misses the camaraderie of his team and feels cold and
                            alone in his pain. James states that first responders should be well
                            equipped with emotional and physical care for all rescue efforts. If an
                            attack were to happen again, James would still respond, but pay more
                            attention to families, trying to call them more and try to relieve their
                            worries. He hopes for history’s sake that there is much more
                            appreciation for those men and women who protect our lives and the
                            sacrifices that they make for us.

       Kevin was born and lived in Manhattan until the age of six when his
                            family moved to Long Island. His father was a firefighter and his mother
                            a nurse. His parents instilled in him a desire to help society and do
                            what he could do give back. He is a former Boy Scout and Marine. He was
                            a corrections officer in the 1980’s at Rikers Island but due to a back
                            injury in 1992, he left ended his career as a corrections officer and
                            went back to school. As a member of the Bellmore Fire Department, he
                            also became a paramedic and an EMT. He also went to school to be a
                            social worker. Kevin was in school at the time of the attacks. When he
                            heard about the event, he left his class and picked up his children at
                            school. He headed to New York City. He travelled with another EMT to
                            Shea Stadium and felt adrenaline as if he were again in the Marine
                            Corps. He arrived at Ground Zero on 9/11 and was in shock (he didn’t
                            realize how affected he was until years later) at the complete and utter
                            devastation. He saw a melted ambulance and was amazed at the perfect
                            window blinds hanging from a window in the Trade Center and how the
                            blinds could survive, but people didn’t. He arrived in the early
                            afternoon and spent much of his time cleaning eyes. He saw
                            unrecognizable body parts and described a scene where firemen asked him
                            to run a line under the rubble. Only he realized everyone under the
                            rubble was dead. Kevin said “New York City means so much to me.” He
                            called it “my city.” He loves the city and spent weekends there as a
                            child staying with his grandmother. The emotional effects of Mr. Kelly’s
                            time at Ground Zero did not hit until four years later. He said when it
                            hit him, it hit hard. He described on the second or third day he
                            received a rudimentary respirator. He became frustrated at not having
                            the proper equipment. He was stationed at One Liberty Plaza and did not
                            leave for three days. At one point, he saw a man on the ground with
                            symptoms of a heart attack and treated him. His parents and wife saw him
                            on TV. His wife was proud. His father, a former NYC firefighter, lost
                            many friends. He was disappointed at the lack of injuries to treat and
                            felt guilty going home. He wanted to go back and follow through; he felt
                            it was his duty to help people. He worked at the site for a little over
                            a week until he had to go back to work at his job at St. Francis
                            Hospital nursing department. He viewed Ground Zero as “Dante-esque” at
                            night; with the lights on, it seemed like a movie. He did not go to
                            funerals. He feels guilty that he did not follow in his father’s
                            footsteps and become a firefighter. He feels a sense of connection and a
                            sense of loss because more “Kellys” died on 9/11 than any other surname.
                            Old movies with scenes of the Trade Center are disturbing to him and he
                            once was treated for PTSD in a doctor’s office with a picture of the
                            towers which upset him. He spoke of being proud of himself and his
                            fellow Americans.” He was impressed with the outpouring of food and
                            cards from children around the county. He said, “It’s a great country.”
                            Kevin now has difficulty with the Muslim community and feels there was
                            not enough of an outcry from them. He fears for his wife and kids. He
                            lives life differently now and is no longer at ease while in the city.
                            He thinks Americans “tend to forget.” He remembers thinking of “the
                            horror” of what it would take for people to jump from the buildings. He
                            doesn’t want people to be paranoid, but instead learn from their
                            mistakes. He does not feel like a hero, he was just doing his job and
                            feels like “a braggart” if he talks about his time at Ground Zero. He
                            considers the attacks a violation of America and hopes this country does
                            not end up like Israel. He feels we are letting immigrants in for the
                            wrong reasons and we should be more selective of who we let in the USA.
                            He hopes the America will still be intact in 100 years.

       On 9/11, Kenneth was working as a HAZMAT supervisor for ConEd. His days
                            began at 6am. That morning, he had been dispatched to Astoria, Queens to
                            clean up spills and accumulated debris in the tunnels. The 20 foot wide
                            tunnels needed general maintenance every year, a project that took a
                            month to accomplish. While working he was alerted to the WTC attacks and
                            was instructed to leave the equipment, leave the tunnel, and drive home.
                            It took him an hour and a half to get home and on the way he noted all
                            kinds of emergency equipment going into the city. Following the attacks
                            Kenneth was positioned at Floyd Bennett Field with the FBI. He helped
                            set up equipment including Tyvek suits for responders going to the WTC
                            site. He continued to work his regular job at the same time. A few weeks
                            later, Kenneth went to work on the pile, where he set up wash stations
                            and HEPA vacs. During Kenneth's 14 hour shifts, he washed down
                            equipment, responder’s hands and feet, and recalls that the environment
                            was “upbeat and cool.” After a while Kenneth was transferred to Vesey
                            and West streets, where he restocked all of the cleaning stations with
                            needed items, including red, white and blue hard hats for the workers.
                            He mentioned that the Red Cross was also there doing a great job, but he
                            noted a lot of waste. Kenneth remembers that the first night that he
                            returned home from the pile, the bottom of his shoes were burned. He
                            considers himself to have an upbeat personality, and always included a
                            little prayer each day before starting work. He met a number of
                            dignitaries as he worked. The mayor of Baton Rouge, Louisiana came by.
                            He noticed a lot of people from out of state helping out, including some
                            celebrities, such as Cheech Moran, Marisa Tomei, and Jesse Jackson, and
                            other actors and actresses who were helping on the Spirit of New York
                            cruise ship, which was set up as a servicing station for the responders.
                            He noted the spirit of encouragement among the people and he noted the
                            vast number of donations coming in. There were items of clothing, lots
                            of bottled water, and dog food, to name a few. Kenneth said “I don’t
                            think we are heroes. We did a job we had to do,” and “I try to treat
                            people the way I like to be treated.” Finally he said “It shouldn’t take
                            an emergency like 9/11 to bring people together.”

       Brian was a ConEd worker on 9/11/01. He has now been retired for five
                            years. On 9/11, he was having breakfast at a diner when he heard of the
                            attacks, and arrived at Ground Zero on 9/12/01 to help restore
                            electricity to the area. He described the first few days as chaotic and
                            mentioned over and over again the smell in the air which at times made
                            him nauseous. To Brian, Ground Zero looked as if it were in black and
                            white, like a dark movie. His job was to go into manholes to restore
                            electricity to the area. In the manholes, the debris was knee deep. He
                            also operated a backhoe to remove debris in order to reach the manholes.
                            There was constant dirt and grit in his mouth—eating was difficult.
                            Brian was glad he could help but felt a need to return home each night
                            to see his wife and check on his two daughters who were away at college
                            at Albany and Stony Brook. He was proud to be there but said he had a
                            few arguments with coworkers because he wanted to leave after long
                            16-hour days. He felt he could not stay there all night. He worked at
                            Ground Zero for 18 days straight. He felt ConEd workers were not
                            mentioned much in the media. This upset him as he and his coworkers
                            worked very hard. He spoke highly of the Red Cross and recounted a nice
                            memory of Chinese people up and down Canal Street clapping. He said the
                            whole event is a blur. Brian remembers that one official at the site
                            said it was safe to breathe on one side of the street but not the other.
                            He mentioned the person saying this had a full respirator on. He felt
                            misled. For the first three days he moved debris around just to be able
                            to reach the manholes. He was proud of the ConEd workers and felt
                            camaraderie with people from other states. He liked the feeling of
                            patriotism. Brian feels things went back to normal pretty quickly and
                            people forgot, but he will never forget. His brother, who has since gone
                            blind, worked at the site as well and he talks to him about it
                            sometimes, but he never discusses the event with his family. He would go
                            back again if needed, but he would be better equipped.

       Reverend Terry is a Jamaican immigrant who arrived in the United States
                            in 1989. He operates a street ministry and started the first mobile
                            church in the metropolitan area. His church is based in Brooklyn, but he
                            also serves Queens, the Bronx, and New Jersey. His ministry serves many
                            functions—as a liaison with police, outreach for immigrants, and he also
                            works with the DA’s office and Homeland Security. Reverend Terry arrived
                            at Ground Zero a few days after the attacks as a clergy liaison for the
                            NYPD. He wondered why people commit an attack like this; it was the
                            first time in his life he witnessed such a disaster. He saw people
                            crying, and was impressed by all the people who came from many states in
                            the US. There were many “angels” at Ground Zero and it was dangerous. A
                            good friend, a police chief, lost his nephew and gave the Reverend roses
                            to bring to the site. Terry takes “his hat off to the NYPD.” After a few
                            weeks he volunteered to work for the Office of Emergency Management, and
                            brought his jacket and hat from the OEM to this interview. The Reverend
                            had only a white paper mask for most of the time he spent at the site.
                            He described people from every walk of life, every faith and every age
                            all looking for people under the rubble. He was at Ground Zero on and
                            off for approximately two years praying and blessing bodies at the
                            morgue. He described the morgue as “unbearable,” but felt someone had to
                            be there to bless the bodies. He looked forward to being there every day
                            and attends the memorial service each 9/11. His wife was very
                            supportive, yet terrified, and would wash his clothes each day when he
                            came home. He feels the disaster has changed him as a person. When he
                            looks back and sees all the 9/11-related illnesses now, he is concerned.
                            His health is always in question. He has gone to Washington to support
                            the Zadroga Bill with the friends he had met at Ground Zero. Revered
                            Terry relied on his faith to get him through each day. He believed Jesus
                            was there and the beams in the shape of a cross helped to bring about
                            spirituality and healing. As a result of his time spent at Ground Zero,
                            the Reverend founded the organization IRTC (Immigrants Responding to
                            Crisis). Both he and his wife were illegal aliens on 9/11. He believes
                            God sends him where he is needed. He still carries images in his mind of
                            his time at the site. He would respond again to a similar disaster if
                            needed.

       Gary has been married for 26 years, has 3 children, and lives on Long
                            Island. At the time of 9/11 he worked for Hewlett Packard, where he is
                            still employed. At that time he was an IT project manager and worked in
                            Manhattan. He had previously worked all over the world doing this type
                            of work and was very used to travelling. On the morning of 9/11, he was
                            already on his way downtown to Liberty Plaza to meet a colleague when
                            the first plane hit. Gary had just gotten off the 7th avenue train and
                            he called the person he was meeting to find out where he wanted to meet.
                            He could see smoke billowing out of the WTC area but didn’t know what
                            was happening and thought it was perhaps something electrical. His
                            colleague told him that something happened but he wasn’t sure what was
                            going on. They met up and got some coffee in a diner on 34th street and
                            just sat and waited. The subways and trains were all shut down as well
                            as any traffic into the area. They sat watching TV in the diner as
                            others poured in and watched and wondered like everyone else. Then the
                            2nd plane hit and they knew it was something bad. The city outside was
                            closed and now the phone lines were down, no connection to the outside.
                            He recalls that people started to panic, but he stayed in the diner for
                            another 3.5 hours. There was a lot of commotion after the 2nd building
                            was hit and collapsed. Gary knew the city like the back of his hand
                            because he had worked there since 1980, and realized with the subways
                            and trains not running that the only way out was to walk across the 59th
                            Street Bridge, find a subway in Queens, and then make his way to Jamaica
                            and get a train home. So that’s exactly what he did, along with many
                            others. The next day he received a phone call from one of his bosses
                            stating that they were reassessing all projects from a financial
                            prospective. This would be a huge loss for Hewlett Packard. He and a
                            senior manager reached out to a restoration service for IT related
                            issues and HP formed a partnership with this company. The first job was
                            2 days after the attack, when he was sent in to assess a job at a
                            Staples in lower Manhattan. He took a train to Fulton street and headed
                            to Staples, seeing the twisted concrete, steel, and smoke. “I’ll never
                            forget the smell, people burning,” he said. There was chaos and first
                            responders everywhere; everyone converging in one area. It was a
                            nightmare. The Staples store was a disaster and only a block from the
                            WTC site. His job was to assess the computer situation to see if
                            anything was salvageable. If not, the company would file insurance
                            claims for new equipment. Gary did this type of work for many companies
                            in the area after 9/11. Outside there was chaos, particles floating in
                            the air, dust, and dirt. No one was wearing a mask, no one had direction
                            and areas were blocked off. The next day he went to Moody’s Investments,
                            which was even closer to Ground Zero. When he stepped into the building,
                            he was up to his knees in dust and debris. It was hanging on the ceiling
                            and on the walls. His next job was in the Merrill Lynch building. He
                            went into the city 4 days a week, spending 4-5 hours a day checking on
                            the men he supervised and the projects they were working on. He did this
                            without hesitation, concern, or fear. He thought nothing of it. The
                            destruction didn’t faze him; he was matter-of-fact about everything. He
                            stated that he was pretty much numb and after the first few days and
                            worked in a robotic fashion. Gary went back and forth into the city
                            around the WTC site and Ground Zero many times. He never wore a mask and
                            never even changed his clothes when he got home, even though he was
                            covered in dust and particles. He didn’t realize until much later the
                            damage this could be causing. One day he noticed that trucks leaving the
                            area were being hosed off, and he began to think about this. Another
                            day, he was going to the Deutsche Bank building and he was told he
                            couldn’t enter unless he had medical clearance, wore a mask, and took a
                            course. Baseline tests were also required. He was also required to don
                            Hazmat gear. This was 2-3 months after 9/11--two to three months of
                            never wearing a mask or not washing his clothes because he didn’t think
                            there was anything wrong with the air quality. Now he knew something was
                            up. Gary says that he never suffered any after effects from going back
                            and forth. He never saw any carnage and the only health effects he has
                            suffered is severe GERD. Because he worked for a private company as a
                            contractor, he would not have received any compensation from any WTC
                            related fund. He ate in delis around the corner from the site and
                            nothing thought anything of it. Gary said people got used to the dust
                            and debris after a while. He knew a few people who had died in the
                            Cantor Fitzgerald building and one very distant cousin was lost. Gary
                            said that even though he wasn’t a first responder, he felt like he was a
                            part of it. He had a sense of patriotism with conflicting feelings
                            because he was there to make money for his company, even though this was
                            a necessary job. He certified equipment for Dow Jones and Merrill Lynch
                            and he was there sporadically for approximately 9 months after the
                            disaster. He said if it happened again, he might not be so quick to go
                            back. After all, he’s not so young anymore. He feels a sense of
                            deception with regard to the air quality situation. Gary states he did
                            not feel like a hero at all, but was a contributor. He said it was a
                            collective act of all humankind toward the cleanup, and that people
                            galvanized in the short term but that it didn’t last long, and the
                            country was split after that. Gary is not spiritual, but a realist. He
                            said he wanted to get the job done and then get out. He will never
                            forget the collapse of the buildings, the smell, darkness and disbelief
                            that this could happen to our city. We are no longer safe from the
                            world; this can happen again in our country. We have now been put on
                            guard; it’s a bad world out there.

       Robert was a laborer working for an electricians union who worked on
                            pipes feeding traffic signals near the WTC site. He was working off
                            McDonald Avenue in Brooklyn when he heard the news from a guy in a taxi
                            cab. He went to his office in Long Island City, and recalls there being
                            silence. He remembers that it was eerie and no one was on the streets.
                            The next day, he and a few coworkers decided to take a van into the
                            city. Robert remembers that, “It looked like an atomic bomb went off,
                            everything was grey.” He distinctly remembers the smell. Robert went to
                            work straight to the pit on the “pile.” He recalls being afraid that
                            other buildings were going to fall, and that they had lasers pointed at
                            buildings to detect any movement of the buildings. He remembers trying
                            to find people alive, and this thought kept him working at the pile. He
                            worked next to units from the FBI and DEA. Robert recalled one
                            particular moment in which he found a raggedy doll in the rubble. He
                            could not explain this to his wife, and said he has only recently been
                            sharing these memories with a counselor. Robert’s WTC experiences
                            impacted his family life, and for awhile he was more irritable with his
                            family. He says it is getting better now, and that he would definitely
                            go out on the pile to help again.

       Steven is a professor of psychiatry at Stony Brook Hospital with 25 years
                            of experience. He is currently a psychiatrist working for the WTC
                            program. In this interview, Steven spoke of the mental health symptoms
                            that WTC responders face ten years after the WTC attacks, and describes
                            the tri-component model (TCM) implemented at the Long Island WTC clinic.
                            The TCM model allows the clinical psychiatrist, social workers, and
                            primary medical doctors to develop a structured and integrated approach
                            to treating responders with physical and mental health comorbidities.
                            Steven mentioned that a majority of responders who worked at the WTC
                            site are highly functional men and women who benefit greatly from this
                            combination of treatment and support services. Steven described some of
                            the types of PTSD symptoms seen at the clinic such as ‘psychic numbing’
                            which is characterized by flat affect and avoidance of contact with
                            other people. Another rare PTSD symptom is dissociative reaction, in
                            which a responder forgets details of a traumatic event. He also
                            described the survivor guilt experienced by many WTC responders; those
                            who felt they did not do enough to help out after the attacks.
                            Responders who worked at the landfill experienced the particular trauma
                            of sifting through debris for identifying body parts and personal items.
                            Steven mentioned that once a certain amount of trauma is experienced, a
                            person’s neurobiology can be altered almost irreversibly. Medications
                            and support services can help reconstitute a person’s health.

       Marvin worked as a paramedic at the time of 9/11. He was on staff for St.
                            Vincent’s Hospital as well as several other area hospitals. Marvin
                            trained at a young age and always loved his job. He told us that he was
                            an EMT for the US Open several times and met many famous people
                            including Paul McCarthy and his wife at the time, Heather Mills. On the
                            day of 9/11, Marvin was stationed in Queens with his partner and a
                            student. A call came over the radio that said "single 40" which means a
                            plane crash. They were hungry and had finished the call they were on so
                            they didn’t pay much attention to the radio call. Shortly after that,
                            another call came over the radio: "46 willie." This call came over on
                            the city wide broadcast so they knew it was something serious. It was
                            meant for all emergency vehicles to respond so they raced across the
                            59th Street Bridge and were one of the first EMT teams on the scene. It
                            was a little after 9:00am. They heard the 2nd plane hit and knew it was
                            terrorism. Marvin has a vivid memory arriving at the scene. He said
                            people were frozen on the streets looking towards the towers and
                            watching a caravan of 30 plus emergency vehicles with sirens blaring
                            heading downtown…it was total chaos. He ended up parking on Chambers
                            street around by the Millennium Hilton Hotel. He parked on the sidewalk
                            and started walking down Vesey Street. His ran into a friend, Carlos,
                            who was going into one of the building where his wife worked to try and
                            find her. His wife was later found but Carlos was killed in the process
                            of trying to find her. Another friend, named Tommy, who was part of an
                            elite police unit, was killed. In all, 16 people Marvin knew died.
                            Marvin ended up going inside a Chase Bank to assist some people that
                            were crying and injured. He stepped outside and heard someone yell, "The
                            tower, the tower!" All of a sudden if went from day to night, glass
                            breaking, people screaming. You couldn’t see the hand in front of your
                            own face. Then the dust. After the first tower went down everything
                            turned black and time stood still. Marvin thought he was dead. Moments
                            went by and with his years of training, he realized that he had to get
                            the people out of the bank in case it collapsed. So he started to get
                            everyone out and told them to keep moving away from the scene. Marvin
                            started to head back to the Hilton Hotel to find his partner and the
                            student that he had arrived with. He found his partner but the student
                            somehow got separated and they both thought he had died. It was a very
                            sad moment, but again, they had to jump to action and help the injured.
                            When the ambulance was full to capacity, his partner left for the
                            nearest hospital. Marvin stayed behind to help others and it was shortly
                            after this that Marvin heard another rumble. He knew right away that
                            this was the 2nd tower falling. He grabbed a woman that was close to him
                            and they dove into the Hilton entrance. Within seconds, everything
                            crashed and they were covered in smoke, ash, and debris. Again, Marvin
                            thought he was dead. It was so dark and the woman next to him was
                            crying. He realized that he had to get up and get moving. Some of the
                            staff of the hotel were assisting people and Marvin left the woman in
                            their care. Marvin asked how he could get out of the building because
                            the front entrance had been completely closed off with debris. The works
                            took Marvin to a side entrance where there was a large garage door type
                            of closure. The pried the door open a few feet and Marvin rolled under
                            it to get to the outside. Once there, he thought that the world was gone
                            and he was alone. There was dead silence and it looked like a war zone.
                            He thought for sure his partner didn’t make it out in time and that the
                            ambulance he was driving must have been crushed. He had no radio and no
                            cell phone. Time stood still; Marvin wasn’t sure where to go from there.
                            He thought he was starting to hallucinate. He started to hear sounds
                            again and in the distance, he thought he saw something moving towards
                            him. He didn’t know what it was…it was moving closer and closer but with
                            all the debris, he couldn’t see 5 five in front of himself. The noise
                            got louder and louder and the object got closer and closer until all of
                            a sudden, it stopped right in from of Marvin. It was his partner in the
                            ambulance! They ran and hugged each other, glad to be alive. They
                            decided at that point to stay together and headed into a subway to look
                            for survivors but found no one. Marvin spent some time down by the
                            waterfront working in a makeshift hospital. They waited for the injured
                            but none came...they were all killed. Marvin stated that any masks that
                            they had been given out to the public and that he never wore one. There
                            were fires everywhere and rescuers needed to be rescued and body parts
                            were in the streets. Fighter jets were flying above. He was deployed to
                            work on the pile for a brief time and said he went home every night but
                            was never able to sleep alone. He suffers from depression and PTSD and
                            severe asthma. Marvin remembers seeing many responders leave the site
                            and return the later in the day to donate blood to help those that
                            needed it. Marvin returned 3 days later and took a picture of the garage
                            door at the Hilton that he had squeezed under. He then worked as a
                            volunteer on the pile for a few days. He states his motivation was just
                            to find someone alive, that was what he was trained for and it’s what he
                            loved doing. Marvin said he lived alone and cried every night for a long
                            time. He stayed with a girlfriend so he didn’t have to be alone. Marvin
                            ended up suffering a small stroke after the onset of numbness in his
                            hands, leg and then face. It was a day off but he happened to be with
                            his partner in the same Chase Bank he was in when one the first tower
                            fell. He was rushed to the hospital but when he arrived, all sensation
                            came back; he sat up on the stretcher and said he was ok. Within
                            seconds, he suffered a major stroke and spent months rehabilitating. He
                            now stays out of Chase Banks and states that if he can survive 2 fallen
                            towers, he can survive a stroke. He pretty much fully recovered from the
                            stroke and 3 months later he returned to full duty. In 2003 he was
                            diagnosed with severe asthma and PTSD and major depression. In January
                            of 2004, his asthma had become so severe that he had to stop working,
                            doing what he loved all of his life. Marvin now struggles to get the
                            benefits he feels he and others deserve. He feels that the responders
                            are treated badly. That they went from hero to zero. He says that people
                            quickly forget and he gets angry. He states that people need health
                            care, compensation and respect but that everything now has become
                            political. Marvin says that if knew how things would have turned out, he
                            doesn’t know if he would do it again. To this day he is traumatized by
                            9/11.

       William is from West Islip, NY and has been a NYC firefighter since 1987.
                            He is a Sergeant-at-Arms and a Health and Safety Officer. He was always
                            interested in helping people and became a firefighter because he could
                            both help people, and get paid for it, which he thought was a good idea.
                            On the morning of 9/11, he was alerted to the attacks by his
                            sister-in-law and knew immediately it was not an accident. He arrived at
                            his firehouse between 10:30-11:00 AM. On the way to the firehouse, he
                            heard about the second plane. He thought resources would be “stretched”
                            and was worried about manpower. There was chaos once he reached the
                            firehouse but there was a lieutenant in charge, and William followed his
                            direction. The radio traffic was “insane” and the things he heard gave
                            him an urgency to respond. He arrived in Manhattan at about 11:20 AM via
                            the Brooklyn Bridge. He encountered a mass exodus of people covered with
                            soot trying to leave the city. Dust was 6-8 inches deep in the street.
                            His emotions switched from anger to thinking about what he could do to
                            help. He was initially assigned to Building #7 but then was not allowed
                            to enter the building because it was not structurally sound. He heard
                            that a jumper had landed on a friend of his and the friend was killed,
                            yet he could not allow his mind to process it. At about 3:00 AM the
                            events of the day hit the firefighters and people began to cry. William
                            was a part of Engine 238 and was on a mission to “find our guys.” He
                            knew his lieutenant was missing. It was difficult to find water to put
                            out the fires; he tried many fire trucks until one finally worked. When
                            he got on the pile, he realized there would be no survivors. He looked
                            for pockets as planes flew overhead. Gas fed fires could not be put out,
                            the situation was unstable. When it got dark, the men were ordered off
                            the pile. He went to a hotel and was told someone found his lieutenant
                            under the rubble. Ironworkers came to help remove the lieutenant. A beam
                            was lifted to get him out, yet his arm was stuck under another beam.
                            Finally at 2:30 AM they managed to get his arm from under the beam. He
                            described the lieutenant as 6’3” and 260 lbs., yet he was a “bowl of
                            jelly.” William was sure every bone in his body was broken. William went
                            back to the firehouse and the lieutenant’s brother from Boston was
                            there. They travelled to the lieutenant’s house to inform his wife, and
                            William became the family liaison. The Fire Dept. has a deep tradition
                            of taking care of their own and different widows had different needs. It
                            was like a second family. There were 343 firefighters lost on 9/11.
                            William attended many wakes and funerals.

       Frank is a psychiatrist who works for the WTC Medical Monitoring and
                            Treatment Program. He is also an advisor for P.O.P.P.A. (Police
                            Organization Providing Peer Assistance). On 9/11, he was doing
                            psychiatry rounds at St. Catherine’s Hospital. He knew the magnitude of
                            the police response would require extensive mental health support and
                            reached out to Bill Genet, a former police officer and head of POPPA.
                            Frank grew up in an Irish Catholic family with a history of working in
                            the police force. He always wanted to be a doctor but did not know what
                            specialty he wanted to be practice. When he took a clerkship in the VA
                            he decided on psychiatry and became especially interested in working
                            with police officers and veterans due to his own family history in the
                            police force. Frank also provided some background information on POPPA
                            in his interview. In this organization, trained volunteer cops serve as
                            peer advisers to other cops requiring confidential counseling or mental
                            health services. There is a great need for this type of confidential
                            counseling service as cops are at a greater risk of experiencing mental
                            health symptoms of PTSD, and depression due to greater exposure to
                            stress-related events. The person chosen to be a peer responder is often
                            more able to handle traumatic events and learn from how to best to adapt
                            in stressful situations. Since the formation of POPPA, the suicide rate
                            among police officers is 40% lower. POPPA changed the police culture as
                            it provided a venue for police officers to reach out for confidential
                            support in times of stress. Dr. Frank also spoke a little bit about the
                            police culture that is often necessary to understand when treating
                            police officers. He describes the police force as often serving as a
                            second family, in a sense that they often paired in dangerous situations
                            and continuously watch out for each other. Frank described PTSD as a
                            very common mental health problem faced by WTC responders. According to
                            him, a minute of exposure to a very traumatic event is enough to cause
                            lasting PTSD symptoms. Frank explained that during the time of traumatic
                            exposure, the body is in a state of heightened alert. In the case of
                            9/11, responders and civilians witnessed a number of traumatic events
                            ranging from the plane attacks, people jumping from the towers, the
                            fires, the collapse of the towers, and the dangers and uncertainty of
                            working on the “pile.” In cases of PTSD, smells, sights and sounds are
                            enough to trigger symptoms. These memories are situated in the limbic
                            system, the emotional center of the body. Frank described his own PTSD
                            symptoms from 9/11 as triggered by the smell of dead bodies and fires at
                            the site. Dr. Frank believes that for many in the police force, “9/11
                            was the straw that broke the camel’s back.” He is concerned that there
                            are many more officers that have not yet reached out for help after the
                            trauma they’ve experienced on 9/11 and as are yet undiagnosed and
                            untreated for PTSD.

       Father Mike grew up on Long Island and is originally from the Whitestone,
                            Queens area. He is currently Pastor of Our Lady of Lords Church in
                            Islip. Father Mike also teaches at Stony Brook University and is
                            assisting the WTC group doing first responder interviews for the Oral
                            History Project. Although Father Mike was not at Ground Zero, his
                            interview offers another perspective and describes how his parishioners
                            dealt with this tragedy. Father Mike had only been in the Lady of Our
                            Lords Parish in Islip for about a year when 9/11 occurred. He was off
                            that day and had arrived at his gym, where people were talking about
                            what was going on. He watched this unfold on TV with many others. At
                            first, he thought this was an accident but then he and everyone else
                            realized it was not. He headed back to the rectory in Islip where he
                            immediately started receiving phone calls from families. One call was
                            from friends that had a son that was a firefighter and they knew he had
                            gone into the tower. They presumed he had died. Father Mike drove to
                            their house to console them. Before Father Mike arrived, the family
                            found out that their son had managed to get out of the building and was
                            ok. He had assisted others in getting out of the building. Father Mike
                            returned to the rectory because there were 300 kids in Catholic school
                            that were waiting for families to pick them up at the end of the day.
                            Some of the kids left very upset; some kids were left there waiting for
                            someone to come and get them because the parents couldn’t get there
                            right away. The teachers prayed with the children and were there to help
                            and give guidance. It was a difficult situation. Later that day, people
                            were calling the parish to ask how they were going to respond to this
                            attack. What should they do? That night, a mass was arranged and church
                            was jammed, mostly by word of mouth. The atmosphere ran the gamut of
                            emotions. People knew police officers, firefighters and business people
                            that worked in the towers. Other people were waiting to hear about
                            survivors; they knew that some people could not get back home so quickly
                            and so they were just waiting to hear. There was overwhelming anxiety of
                            the unknown. People were brought together by God. The next day many
                            people were calling the church for help. Father Mike and his staff
                            printed out maps of all the people that had called and he went and sat
                            with the families. Some of these people were just waiting for a call
                            from their loves ones. Some people would find closure within a few days;
                            some people never would. Others could not comprehend how to have a
                            funeral when there was no body to bury. What should they do? Some people
                            held out for hope, hope that their loved one had been trapped, would be
                            found and make their way home. For many this never happened. Father Mike
                            said that some people had services quickly and some not until a year
                            later. For Catholics, the absence of a body made closure a very
                            difficult thing. One family put the personal belongings of their loved
                            one into the coffin because that is all they had. In this way, they
                            formed a type of remembrance. Stories of the deceased became immensely
                            important and the survivors would just talk and tell stories about their
                            loved ones. Father Mike attended many funerals, many of which were
                            different because public figures would be in attendance. Father Mike
                            spent a lot of time with families and the Church would gather food,
                            clothing, and even dog food for responders and rescue dogs at Ground
                            Zero. The school children would participate as well. Some children lost
                            the own loved ones and when asked how they dealt with this, Father Mike
                            got emotional and said, sometimes school had to stop. Everything would
                            just stop and the child would be attended to. He said it was very
                            difficult. People wanted to move on, they wanted closure. Father Mike
                            feels that in his experience, grief is a process of maturity and
                            everyone is different. Some people are irrevocably damaged by tragedy.
                            People find connections to God in times of tragedy, and some people feel
                            a sense of abandonment. Ten years later, over time, pain becomes a
                            tender memory, a memory with love. With this some people have been able
                            to move on, but 9/11 is a part of all of us, and we still relate to it.
                            9/11 will always be a powerful part of everyone’s memory.

       Gregg worked in the Criminal Intelligence Division of the NYPD on 9/11.
                            He was going to Manhattan that day for training when someone at his
                            precinct told him to turn on the TV. The events of that morning brought
                            him back to 1993 when the WTC was attacked, and he thought “here we go
                            again.” He and his fellow officers went in their cars to Ground Zero. He
                            was struck by the lack of traffic and the emptiness of the left lane—he
                            knew the US was under attack. He got to City Hall and saw the first
                            tower fall. Gregg arrived at the site and started to help injured
                            people. At one point, he looked up and saw the blue sky and noticed the
                            second tower did not look straight. He told his partner “it is time to
                            run.” He heard what he thought were explosions, but it was the sound of
                            the floors hitting one another as they collapsed. He ran a few blocks
                            away and then became overcome by smoke. He waited until it passed and
                            continued to help people. He was dressed in a suit and gave his tie to a
                            woman with an injured arm. There were no triage areas yet set up. It was
                            hot and dusty, Building #7 was burning. He started digging through the
                            rubble on the bucket brigade. He was in disbelief. He knew numerous
                            people were killed and was in shock that we were at war in the US. He
                            felt he did what he had to do and it was great to see everyone come
                            together working as one. He doesn't remember seeing chaos or mass
                            hysteria. He was at the site until 7 or 8 PM. He then went to the city
                            morgue—detectives were paired with doctors to identify remains. After 1
                            AM, it was determined that there would not be many intact remains. There
                            was no outside communication and the responders had no idea if more
                            planes were coming. He was told to leave at 3 AM. He spoke to his wife
                            and she told him of the attack on the Pentagon. He arrived home at 5 AM
                            took a shower, changed his clothes and went back to work. Terrorism
                            leads were coming in and it was realized who was responsible for the
                            attacks. Gregg investigated leads and worked on the bucket brigade. He
                            worked 12-hours shifts, and had only dug for a few days when his role
                            was shifted back to terrorism. He is still active in the Intelligence
                            Division of the NYPD and still investigating terrorism as of this date.
                            On the Westside Highway, TV stations and reporters with satellites were
                            on one side of the street, and on the other side of the street, there
                            were people cheering. He remembers the constant applause. “The US was
                            one.” Everyone did what they had to do. Gregg feels there is too much
                            division these days and we will be attacked again. He believes, “our
                            goal is divided on keeping the country safe.” He doesn’t want another
                            9/11 to refresh people’s memories. “This was our Pearl Harbor—this was
                            our wake up call.” He knew from that day forward his life and the life
                            of his children would never be the same. He teaches his children about
                            safety and the dangers of the internet. He explains that there are
                            people who do not like the way we live. He talks openly with his
                            children about 9/11. Gregg does not feel like a hero. “It wasn’t a day
                            to be a hero; it was a day to be human.” The event has made him
                            appreciate his family and friends and who he is. He has no medical
                            issues at present and no lasting bad memories although he never wants to
                            forget or lose focus. If the events were to happen again, he would not
                            change a thing. He though Mayor Giuliani did a “remarkable job” and kept
                            the city together.

       Edward was a clergyman on 9/11 who is currently retired. He is married
                            and lives in Huntington. On the morning of 9/11, Edward was working at
                            Huntington Hospital and was called to the first aid squad. He arrived at
                            Ground Zero an hour after the buildings came down. As a part of FEMA, he
                            was at the site for 30 days. He was part of a Critical Stress Management
                            Team and a Roman Catholic deacon. Edward recalled driving to the site in
                            an ambulance that was entirely gray from the soot and with the air
                            conditioning on, everyone in the ambulance turned gray as well. He
                            describes noticing a sweet, pungent odor after a few days at the site.
                            The red glowing steel rods are something that he will always carry with
                            him. He could not stop and think or he never would have survived. Edward
                            worked on the pile with the FDNY. He attended 44 funerals. He recalled a
                            wedding he officiated on 8/22/01, for a fireman and on 9/11/01 that same
                            fireman perished. His wife had a baby that October—on the day his
                            remains were found. If asked to go to a similar event, Edward would do
                            the same, but he would stay longer. Edward believes people responded the
                            way they should and were just there to help one another.

       Lyndon was hired to develop a jazz mass at St. Paul’s Episcopal Chapel,
                            the oldest church in NYC, in April of 2001. On the morning of 9/11, he
                            was at Trinity Church (three blocks south of the towers) on Wall Street
                            for a taping of a presentation of “A Holy Life” with other clergy
                            members. He heard a sound he described as a “crack” and from the window
                            he saw papers flying by. He had no idea what was going on. He and the
                            Director of Communications of the Church left the building to see what
                            they could do to help. It was then the second plane hit with a terrible
                            sound and smell. He saw a giant fireball, it was overwhelming. They ran
                            for their lives. He went into the American Stock Exchange for shelter
                            where he described a subdued scene with no panic. He realized this was
                            more than an accident. He had an ominous feeling and was petrified and
                            full of adrenaline. He returned to the Trinity Church building, which
                            housed a preschool. He and other staff members evacuated about 60-70
                            children from the third floor to the basement. They stayed in the
                            basement hearing windows shattering outside and did not understand what
                            was going on. Teachers were courageous and followed safety procedures.
                            When the first tower collapsed, the ground shook, Lyndon described it as
                            a “sonic boom.” There was a noise and smoke began to enter the basement
                            through the air conditioning vents. Lyndon and other staff wet paper
                            towels and put them over the mouths of the children. They took the
                            children to the street where they ran south toward the Staten Island
                            Ferry. They were all running when the second tower fell. A massive wave
                            of dust came down on them. They were covered in dust from head to toe.
                            Everyone scattered--women were losing shoes. Lyndon was carrying a
                            little girl named Jasmine and felt he had a mission to make sure she was
                            safe. He never saw her again after that day. They arrived at the Staten
                            Island Ferry terminal with all the children. Every child was reunited
                            with their parents that night. He wondered how many of these children’s
                            parents were killed in the attacks, as many of them worked in the
                            towers. Later, Lyndon got on a bus headed to the east side of 34th
                            Street. He lived on 8th and Broadway. He said he was covered in dust and
                            looked like an “alien intruder.” He watched every bit of news--he was
                            obsessed with finding out if people were okay and if St. Paul’s was
                            still standing. He was certain it had been demolished. His primary
                            motivation was to help but he was not sure how he could. On 9/12, Lyndon
                            walked to St. Paul’s--he described seeing debris, burned cars and
                            computers. He had two goals: To help victims and to rescue a special
                            painting of a turkey (national bird before the eagle) that hung in St.
                            Paul’s. When he reached City Hall, he saw the spire of St. Paul’s and
                            burst into tears. He feels that St. Paul’s might have been spared
                            because “we had a big job to do.” There were no broken windows in the
                            Chapel and about ¼ inch of dust everywhere. The Chapel became a symbol
                            of hope. Lyndon says, “Tragedies cannot be fixed but can be healed.” An
                            industry was set up to empower the people who were digging. He was very
                            proud that, during a time of crisis, the church stood up and people were
                            on site 24/7 until the job was finished eight and a half months later.
                            Five million meals were served at St. Paul’s and chiropractors,
                            podiatrists, and massage therapists treated the responders at all times.
                            The meals grew from hamburgers grilled on the street to five star meals.
                            Lyndon walked through Ground Zero every day and did blessings on body
                            bags. It was an amazing experience that changed his life. He was brought
                            to St. Paul’s to start a new congregation and didn’t know caring for
                            responders would be his new job. He feels it was a “season of love where
                            people showed kindness and courage.” Lyndon feels both he and many
                            responders put personal issues on a shelf that would later come back to
                            haunt them. St. Paul’s became an “oasis for healing” for responders. He
                            feels the grieving was extenuated due to the way in which the remains
                            were found and “it is very difficult to process that kind of grief.”
                            Every night about 100 people slept at St. Paul’s. It was a challenge to
                            make meaning out of this tragedy. People had more problems at home and
                            “couldn’t relate.” “We lost our way.” Eventually, “the season of love
                            came to an end due to the economy and two wars.” Lyndon started what he
                            calls “The Garden of Forgiveness” after 9/11.” It keeps him driven to
                            think about ways people can heal with resilience, transformation and
                            hope. He hopes the tenth anniversary is a new beginning. He said the
                            nation is “stagnant, apathetic and cynical.” He is writing a book on how
                            congregations can get through tragedies. He was very upset on the
                            decision to go to war with Iraq and still believes Saddam Hussein had no
                            connection to 9/11. Lyndon has had a difficult time moving on—he has
                            health issues, lost his home and his marriage and became bitter. He
                            believes it is a danger to fetishize 9/11 and is trying to help
                            communities move beyond grief and not to forget it, but let it go and
                            embrace the future. Lyndon carries many memories with him-- he remembers
                            all the boots of the firefighters hanging on a fence and one firefighter
                            saying, “they won’t be coming back.” He remembers birds nesting in a
                            tree at St. Paul’s when spring came, the rescue dogs lying on the marble
                            floors to cool themselves, Christmas Eve at the Chapel, and mostly, the
                            generosity of people. The experience Lyndon had at St. Paul’s was “the
                            privilege of a lifetime..."

       Monica helped organize the first United Religious Initiative (URI)
                            gathering in New York in 1997, and signed the URI Charter in June 2000
                            at the United Nations garden. She has been at the UN since 1991,
                            representing The Ribbon International and Pathways to Peace before
                            representing the URI in 2002. Monica chaired the annual Department of
                            Public Information NGO Conference in 1996, and continues to work with
                            the Department of Public Information on the annual International Day of
                            Peace Youth Observance. Since 2005, Monica has worked with member states
                            and the UN system agencies to promote interfaith dialogue and
                            cooperation for peace. As the URI NGO representative, her current
                            projects include the International Day of Peace on Sept. 21 and the
                            Tripartite Forum, a partnership with member states, UN system agencies
                            and religious non-government organizations (NGOs) to promote inter-faith
                            cooperation for peace. On September 10, Monica was in NYC with NGOs
                            preparing for Cultural Peace Week. A special service was being prepared
                            to celebrate a decade of peace. She was working with ambassadors and
                            interfaith leaders. It was her job to coordinate the special “Blessing
                            of the Children” event that took place on Sept. 13. She was walking to
                            St. Bartholomew’s when the 2nd plane hit. Monica remembers seeing people
                            handing out tennis shoes so others could walk across the bridge. She was
                            living on Long Island at the time and went home that night. The event
                            she was preparing for included many children from all over the world,
                            and some were left stranded due to 9/11. Monica ended up taking 2 kids
                            home after the 9/11 attacks; one from Hungary and one from Romania,
                            until flights were arranged for them to get back home. On the morning of
                            9/11, people were gathering at the Peace Bell when the planes hit. The
                            bell was supposed to be rung in honor of World Peace Day. She and others
                            went to pray; security was heightened. She said she felt safe inside the
                            church. Monica was remembering back on the 10th, when she was having
                            dinner in the UN dining room. She remembers seeing lightening without
                            thunder. She said it was a light show. A friend commented that the light
                            show was like being in a war zone, death. The next day, the smell of
                            smoke is something she will never forget. She said it was almost like a
                            foreboding of what was to come. Monica is not angry and was not afraid
                            to travel. She believes peace can be attained. Monica ends all her
                            e-mails by saying “May Peace Prevail on Earth.”

       Jennifer is the widow of John. She was born and raised in Brooklyn and
                            spent summers on the east end of Long Island. Her husband worked for Fed
                            Ex and they met in Sept. of 2000 through mutual friends. They were
                            married in Oct. 2002 and moved to Long Island in 2003. At 6 months
                            pregnant in 2006, Jennifer’s husband was diagnosed with stage 4 colon
                            cancer and 3 months later their son Jack was born. On the morning of
                            Sept. 11, Jennifer was at work at a law firm on Rector Street. Her
                            husband was off that day. He was a volunteer firefighter and she was
                            also very involved with the fire department. Jennifer and some
                            co-workers left their office to see what was going on. She remembers
                            clutching her cup of coffee. They knew it wasn’t good. They were
                            stepping over body parts trying to find their way around. She remembers
                            seeing bones, a severed foot, and other body parts in the street. She
                            was standing south of the towers and heard the 2nd plane hit. Her
                            building was being evacuated and she finally ditched her coffee
                            realizing that it was unimportant. By the time all her co-workers left
                            the building, it was too late for her to leave and cross the bridge so
                            she went into a nearby restaurant, Moran's. She was able to find out
                            that her husband’s ladder company was waiting to be deployed but she
                            still had not been able to reach him. She went outside and people were
                            screaming and just then, the 1st building fell. They ran back into the
                            restaurant. People were praying. Jennifer says she blacked out for a
                            minute. She went back outside and snow was falling…it was like a movie
                            scene; quiet, dust falling everywhere. One of the co-workers that had
                            stayed behind with her was not dealing with this very well and they
                            tried to find their way out. They started walking south and walked over
                            the Brooklyn Bridge. She went to her parents home and they told her that
                            they had heard from John and he was at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge.
                            She heard from him at 11:00pm that night. He was working for Ladder 123.
                            He went home that first night and he returned to the site the next
                            morning. When they married, they placed an ad in the NY Times wedding
                            section. It said ‘If we can get through this we can get through
                            anything’. Jennifer describes her husband as very honor bound, loyal,
                            honorable. They both lost a lot of people in 9/11 and in the days to
                            come but Jennifer says she wasn’t angry. John was. He ended up spending
                            over 500 hours at the site and did someone else’s’ shift as well because
                            he was having trouble coping. When Jennifer returned to work, she would
                            meet John at the site and he would take her and show her different
                            things that he had found. She never thought of the physical consequences
                            only the emotional ones. After time, John became exhausted but he was
                            incredibly strong. He said he would stay until the job was done; he
                            wanted to bring closure to families. He was very serious about the ‘no
                            man left behind’ statement. They went to many funeral and wakes and once
                            John was no longer able to, Jennifer went alone. In 2006 when John was
                            diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, toxins had already invaded other
                            organs, his stomach and liver. For the next 3-1/2 years, he underwent
                            chemotherapy every 2 weeks. He had several major surgeries and never
                            gave up. To this day Jennifer is still sad but considers herself lucky
                            for all the help and support she receives from friends, family, the
                            FealGood Foundation, other widows and local firefighter organizations.
                            She is grateful that her son Jack had 2-1/2 years to get to know his
                            father. She feels her son is well adjusted and has an inner light just
                            like his father. Jennifer says she hasn’t dealt with the loss yet; she
                            fills her time with her son and work and says that some nights she
                            sleeps and other nights she doesn’t. She says that most of the time, she
                            is exhausted. It was John's duty and honor to bring people home and if
                            called upon, he would do it again. Her husband was selfless and didn’t
                            consider himself to be a hero. Jennifer says that maybe someday, she’ll
                            be happy again, but not yet.

       Nancy and Eric came into for an interview to talk about her deceased
                            husband and his father a sergeant in the NYPD for 18 years at the time
                            of 9/11. They had been married for 17 years. Nancy described her husband
                            as someone who loved his job. He also was an avid long distance marathon
                            runner. On 9/11 he was working for Manhattan South’s task force. He
                            spent time on the pit (12 hours a day) and was at the morgue for four
                            months. Her husband had just got home from work about a half hour before
                            the first plane hit. He went back to work as soon as he heard the news.
                            Nancy was upset that her husband was not told of any of the risks and
                            had no respiratory mask. She described her husband as a quiet man who
                            lost several friends on 9/11. It was a difficult time for their family,
                            she felt isolated as her husband was at work much of the time. Being a
                            police officer’s wife was difficult. They continued life as best they
                            could during the time after the attacks. Nancy said her husband was very
                            upset about an event that happened during the first week after 9/11. He
                            was told to climb a rope in Building No. 5 to retrieve bonds. She thinks
                            this may have something to do with his death. Her husband became
                            concerned about his lungs and in 2003 went to Mt. Sinai for monitoring.
                            The report came back with a high white blood count, rhinitis, bad cough,
                            and blood in his urine. In 2004, he put in for retirement and planned to
                            move to Florida. A few months later he changed his mind and went back to
                            work as part of the NYPD. On 4/06/2004, police officers knocked on their
                            door and said her husband had committed suicide by a gunshot to the
                            stomach. He was found in his car in a gas station parking lot in Nassau
                            County. There was no note, and Nancy believes he would have never shot
                            himself in the stomach. He lived in Suffolk and worked in New York City
                            so it seemed strange that he was found in Nassau County. At the time he
                            was found, he had been missing for 14 hours. Nancy believes her husband
                            did not commit suicide, but was murdered. There was no blood in the car
                            and a lack of evidence. Many people entered her home at the time of his
                            death and in her grief; she had no idea who they were. She believes her
                            husband never would have committed suicide and left his children. He was
                            a good father. Nancy has spent a great deal of money trying to uncover
                            the mystery surrounding her husband’s death with no success. Her
                            husband’s medical records have mysteriously disappeared. His date and
                            time of death is undetermined. She feels the NYPD treated her and her
                            family with cruelty. Nancy received a lump sum at the time of her
                            husband’s death. She is running out of money and searching for closure
                            for her and her children. She finds it hard to move on.

       Roberto was a Department of Corrections officer working in the Emergency
                            Services Unit at Rikers Island. On the morning of 9/11/2001, he heard
                            about the attacks. He gathered all of his equipment for search and
                            rescue and headed to work at Rikers Island to mobilize for the search
                            and rescue effort. He was told to report to the Stuyvesant High School,
                            two blocks away from the World Trade Center. He knew he was going to
                            look for people in a confined space, so he had prepared and brought his
                            equipment such as Ajax and Hirsch tools used for excavations. In the
                            beginning it was a little overwhelming to him. He recalls there were K-9
                            units searching for bodies at the site. Embers from the towers were
                            burning and he reminisced knowing that they were still burning 4 to 5
                            weeks later. His workload through January of 2002 consisted of 16 hour
                            shifts at Rikers Island and 12 hour shifts either on the “Pile” or at
                            the landfill on Staten Island. “This was one of those times,” Roberto
                            said, “that all of the law enforcement operations came together smoothly
                            to assist with the rescue and recovery process.” Roberto sacrificed his
                            time, as did “everybody who worked down there.” His motivation in
                            continuing the work at Ground Zero was to help family members and
                            victims of the disaster find some closure. Roberto does not feel like a
                            hero. He says it was part of his job as Corrections officer in the
                            E.S.U. at Rikers. He does believe that the more the training there is in
                            these situations, the better it is for everyone. He feels that his
                            experience was a positive one and “as a fellow American “would respond
                            again if another such emergent disaster were to happen here. Since his
                            experience working at the site he no longer likes to be in crowded
                            places and has lost his desire for going into the city. Roberto feels
                            that unfortunately people are “reactive” to their environment and not
                            “proactive. He closed his interview by urging everyone to observe their
                            surroundings and report anything out of the ordinary. Roberto says he
                            was “born and raised an American” and is very proud of it.

       Anthony was an NYPD detective for 20 years. He worked as a police officer
                            in the beginning of his career at the 115th Precinct in Jackson Heights,
                            spent three years as a NARC, five years in the Impersonation Squad and
                            finished his career in Internal Affairs. He is now retired and owns a
                            tow truck company. Anthony was on his way to a training session in
                            Chelsea (lower Manhattan) and was scheduled to be there by 9:00 AM. He
                            was almost to the Midtown Tunnel when the first plane hit. He heard it
                            on the radio and wondered why the plane did not fly into the Hudson
                            River. He thought maybe it was due to a computer glitch with air
                            traffic. He assumed the training he was due to attend was cancelled so
                            he travelled to his office in Long Island City. At the time of the first
                            collapse, he was in his office. At the time of the second collapse, he
                            was on the Brooklyn Bridge. He was afraid of what was coming next. A sea
                            of people was heading toward him when he was trying to get over the
                            Brooklyn Bridge. He got over the bridge and was directed to go to the
                            police academy which was set up as a temporary command post. Rumors were
                            flying, F16 jets flying over NYC, it was surreal. Anthony was sent to
                            hospitals to see what he could find out about the attacks by
                            interviewing victims. He interviewed 5-6 people at the hospital that
                            day. He was glad to get home at the end of the day and did not want to
                            return to the city. He felt his home during this time became his
                            sanctuary. He has guilt that he did not want to go back and feels he
                            didn’t do enough, but it was not what he signed up to do. He returned to
                            his office on 9/12 and families started to demanding to know the
                            whereabouts of their loved ones. He described 9/12 as a “total blur.” On
                            9/13/01, his unit was chosen to set up a bereavement center. The first
                            was set up at Bellevue then it was moved to the Armory. He described the
                            lines of people as surreal—“there were so many people it looked as if
                            they were lined up to go on a roller coaster.” It was an extremely
                            difficult job and Anthony had to ask intimate details in order to help
                            identify body parts. Every person asked if he thought their person was
                            alive. He held their hand and told them he hoped so but he knew after a
                            few days that there was no hope. The NYPD saw this job was wearing on
                            the officers, and counselors were brought it. Some people knew the
                            truth; some were in denial. He spent two weeks there and every day it
                            was packed with people, some waiting all day. He was not experienced in
                            delivering bad news to families and it was overwhelming. He went home
                            like a “zombie,” and did not talk about it. After working at the
                            Bereavement Center, Anthony was sent to the Staten Island Landfill once
                            or twice a week. He felt numb and was on autopilot. Through therapy, he
                            has learned a lot about his experience there. It was depressing to dig
                            for bodies in a garbage dump. He would like the landfill to be hallowed
                            ground and not be called “a garbage dump.” People were turned to dust.
                            He had no protective equipment for two days. He sifted through debris
                            with garden tools and put any remains he found in five gallon buckets.
                            There was no pressure to keep going at the landfill--you could rest if
                            needed and there were many volunteers—FBI, DEA, and the Red Cross. As
                            time went on a tent was put up so people could eat there. Anthony has
                            lots of memories, many of people thanking the responders. He recalled a
                            man from Alabama who scrubbed his boots. The events of 9/11 changed his
                            view on Americans—he is angry about the proposed mosque in NYC and said
                            he is now the only guy on his block that flies a flag. He believes we
                            are back at 09/10/01 and there is no patriotism in the country. He has
                            now learned what is important to him through five years of intensive
                            therapy and drugs. In 2004 he had a massive panic attack which prompted
                            him to enter a program through the NYPD. He is much better now although
                            he can never say he is cured. He feels it will never go away. He no
                            longer suffers from panic attacks and hasn’t for three years. He is
                            afraid of future medical problems, and the politics of the Zadroga Bill
                            makes him sour. Anthony feels he has served in a war and people should
                            remember 9/11 and not forget how they felt on 9/12. He thinks we need to
                            identify the enemy and have the Middle East identify them also. He is
                            proud of what he did and proud of the people who served at Ground
                            Zero.

       In Eileen's interview, she spoke about her deceased husband, Michael, a
                            sergeant in the NYPD. On 9/11, Michael was stationed on the Brooklyn
                            Bridge to help evacuate victims. He was gone for 15 hours when he came
                            home. He was stationed at the morgue on 9/12. On 9/13 he was sent to the
                            Staten Island Landfill for 12 hour shifts, which continued until the
                            spring of 2003. He was at the landfill 2-3 times a week. When he would
                            come home after work, he would get undressed in the garage. His comment
                            to his wife when he returned from the landfill was, “it was
                            smoldering—nothing good is going to come out of this.” Eileen said she
                            thought he was talking about himself when he made this comment. At this
                            time, they had three children. Michael seemed very sad, mentally drained
                            and moody. He was always tired and gained weight. He complained of the
                            smell and the constant taste of sulfur in his mouth. After a few years,
                            the longer time away from 9/11, the more things went back to normal.
                            They had a fourth child in 2003. In April of 2006, Michael had a sore
                            throat. He took antibiotics and then stronger antibiotics. A lump in his
                            neck appeared and was biopsied at Stony Brook Hospital with a diagnosis
                            of small lymphatic lymphoma. They were shocked; they never expected the
                            lump to be cancerous. Michael started chemotherapy within a week. After
                            a while, a large mass appeared under his armpit (large B-Cell lymphoma).
                            The doctors were perplexed; he was only 40 years old. He began more
                            aggressive treatment for eight weeks and became bloated and lost his
                            hair. Finally, a third lymphoma appeared, mantle cell lymphoma, which
                            was the most deadly of the three cancers. Michael needed a bone marrow
                            transplant. They began the process of getting treatment at Sloan
                            Kettering which took a few months. Michael’s oldest sister was an exact
                            match. On April 15, 2007, Michael had a bone marrow transplant and
                            remained in the hospital for four weeks. His first PET scan came back
                            clean, they were very happy. In August, 2007, a repeat PET scan came
                            back positive for cancer. Michael died in November 2007—he had been sick
                            for 18 months. Eileen said he fought an amazing fight and feels his
                            involvement in 9/11 rescue and recovery is the reason he got sick, but
                            still thinks he should have went. Eileen said people do tend to forget
                            and life goes on but it is always there for her. She recalled the great
                            nurses and doctors she met during her husband’s illness and does
                            appreciate life and people more now. She believes that her husband
                            should not have had to fight to get treatment at Sloan; it should have
                            been a given. Michael would have been eligible for retirement in April
                            of 2007. She didn’t know what he would say if he was asked if he would
                            respond again in the same way. Her four children, ages 15, 13, 10 and 7
                            keep her busy and focused.

       Stephen is the father of Robert, a deceased NYC Police Officer. Stephen
                            wanted to come and share his story about his son. His interview took
                            place on what would have been his son’s 43rd birthday. Stephen wanted to
                            do the interview on this date because he felt it had more meaning for
                            his son’s memory. Stephen is a retired NYC school teacher, avid golfer
                            and actor in community theater. His son, Robert, joined the academy in
                            1994; his precinct was located in West Harlem. He describes his son as
                            bigger than life and very affectionate. Father and son were very close.
                            Robert loved fishing, was good-natured and always there for friends. He
                            was over 200 pounds, a strong man, body builder and weight lifter but
                            soft in temperament. He has a wife, Carla and a son, Noah. On 9/11,
                            Robert was in West Harlem at his regular job site, but headed down to
                            Ground Zero. Robert didn’t contact his father for a few days to let him
                            know he was ok, and Stephen only got bits and pieces from his son or his
                            daughter-in-law. He knew that things were bad, that his son had to
                            undress in the garage and hose himself off before he even went into the
                            house. He told his father that all the workers were courageous even
                            though they knew it was dangerous. Stephen refers to these people as
                            courageous heroes. Stephen said his son always retained his sense of
                            humor and sense of humanity while others were breaking down. Robert
                            worked in and around the site for a number of weeks before returning to
                            his regular job in West Harlem. Meanwhile, he had started coughing up
                            things. Stephen was angry at the politicians because they said the air
                            was ok...he knew it wasn’t. How could it be? In April of 2006, Robert
                            began to have health problems. It was discovered that he had a tumor in
                            his brain stem that was inoperable. This was a very rare tumor in
                            adults. He went through months of chemo and at one point almost started
                            to feel better. The doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering told them that
                            the tumor was not 9/11-related but they knew that was not true. Then the
                            tumor progressed quickly. In October of 2009 he passed away in hospice
                            at St. Charles in Port Jefferson. Some days Stephen feels his son’s
                            presence very strongly. He has depressing moments but tries to focus on
                            his family, his acting and golf. He is also on a memorial committee for
                            9/11 responders helping them get proper recognition. “He was a damn good
                            cop, damn good person, I’m very proud of him and I miss him."

       Oliver was a transit cop for District 32. He was on vacation on 9/11, and
                            reported in the following Saturday, and began 12 hour shifts on the
                            pile. He also worked at the Staten Island landfill, which was a "toxic
                            waste dump." He remarks that the mask filters only lasted about half an
                            hour and that there was no supervision despite the site's toxic
                            environment, and that now HAZMAT rules are much more strict. He felt
                            they were very unprepared for this work. Oliver recalls the smell of
                            burning concrete, eating in the mess tent in the middle of the waste
                            dump, and masks being clotted with dust. He worked on the conveyor belt,
                            using a paint bucket to look through debris for body parts. Oliver never
                            found any. When he went home at the end of his shifts, he had a burning
                            aftertaste in the back of his throat. He did this work because it was
                            his duty to do so. Oliver lost a good friend, Joe Vigiano, a firefighter
                            in 75th precinct. Oliver himself got sick with lung disease and he now
                            wears a pacemaker. He feels like he has a 2nd chance at life. He suffers
                            from PTSD: the smell of fire, burning concrete, and paper remind him of
                            9/11. If it happened again, he would make sure to get better protective
                            equipment. He notes that the country came together and that "We stuck
                            together, and nothing will take us down.” Oliver feels that the passing
                            of the Zadroga Bill resurrected his faith in government, but that
                            everything has changed – we’re always on alert now. Oliver is looking
                            forward to the birth of his child, and believes that everything has a
                            reason.

       John was born and raised on Long Island. He had an Irish father, and an
                            Indian and Hungarian mother. He grew up in Bethpage and has siblings.
                            John was working for Local 15 as an operating engineer when 9/11
                            occurred. A union tradesman, he was called to remove heavy debris by
                            operating Bobcats, bulldozers, and excavators. On 9/11, he was off work
                            because he was scheduled for foot surgery, which was ultimately
                            canceled. John was home watching TV and saw the 2nd plane hit. He
                            arrived at the site on 9/12 via train to Queens. He and 2 friends packed
                            survival kits with them because they didn’t know how it was going to be
                            once they arrived. There was chaos at Penn Station and people were
                            scared. He headed to Ground Zero by getting rides on construction
                            vehicles that were heading in that direction. He and his friends would
                            hitch a ride until the vehicle stopped then jump on another vehicle,
                            trying to get as close as they could. Once there, he realized the
                            magnitude of the devastation. City blocks were gone; there was no
                            organization. Eighteen hours after his initial arrival, he was sitting
                            on beam resting with some other workers. Yellow smoke was rising and
                            there was that smell. He said it looked like the souls going to heaven.
                            He said "This is going to kill us," but he knew if he didn’t help in the
                            massive rescue and clean-up, that no one else would. John worked doing
                            clean-up around the perimeter and he remembers that they had a fancy
                            brass metal rack that the hotels use for moving luggage around. They
                            used it to hang body parts until they were identified. He was there to
                            find survivors but quickly realized that there were none. John worked 7
                            days a week from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., 12 hours a day for 9-1/2 months…over
                            2,000 hours. He did this to help bring closure to families. He remembers
                            seeing fireman burned into the walls of the buildings. John said that
                            sometimes they would find body parts by smell or by seeing where the
                            flies were. They would shake and scrape through debris to find anything.
                            He said he didn’t think about what he was doing, he just did it. He said
                            he didn’t like to sleep much because it was that down time, the quiet
                            time, that started to make you a little crazy. That’s when you started
                            to think about what you were actually doing and what had actually
                            happened. He was angry at the people that did this to us. John said that
                            many people that died on 9/11 died painlessly and quickly but that the
                            responders are dying slowly, every day. It was only 2 weeks after being
                            at the site that he started coughing up green and yellow stuff. There
                            were no masks in the beginning and when they did come, it was already
                            too late for those that were there from the beginning. He said they were
                            working in a "blender of chemicals, a toxic cesspool." John has stage 4
                            throat cancer, has had 4 operations, endless rounds of chemo and
                            radiation. He has no salivary glands. The last time his feeding tube
                            fell out, he left it out. Six months ago he learned how to speak again
                            and in March 2011, he will be having a 5th surgery to try to enlarge and
                            lengthen his esophagus so he can eat solid food again. John has no
                            money. He cannot work, is on disability, and pays child support. He
                            didn’t ask for cancer. He just wants some help...he wants the government
                            to do the right thing for the responders. He considers himself and the
                            others that responded to this terror attack as patriots, not heroes.
                            Even though every day is a struggle for John, he says that he would do
                            it again for the people but not for the politicians or government. He
                            would do it for his brothers and sisters. John says that he has a few
                            questions for God that he would like answered. Living on earth can be a
                            cruel, cruel world but life is still better than the alternative.

       Ronald was born in Ridgewood, Queens. he is of German descent: his
                            parents immigrated to the States in 1929 (his father) and 1930 (his
                            mother). As an adult, Ron served in the US Navy; he was also a Vietnam
                            veteran. Ron then got a job as a conductor for the Long Island Railroad.
                            He had some experience in fire service and became an instructor in the
                            NYC fire department. On the morning of 9/11, Ron was at home. The City
                            of New York called him after the attack to see if he could send some
                            firefighters to help and he did so. At age 57 Ron became a WTC first
                            responder by working on the pile for eight to ten hours. He recalled
                            that the steel on the pile was a crumpled mess, and that there was a lot
                            of dust, and he was rubbing his eyes and they were irritated. He
                            received goggles and a mask, and continued to work with his hands and a
                            shovel. He worked in a building by the pile, removing broken window
                            glass as there was a danger of the pieces hurting people in the area.
                            Chase Manhattan Bank gave them use of bathroom facilities during their
                            time there. When he went home, his daughters took care of him. He later
                            learned that 7 firefighters from his township had passed away at the WTC
                            site. He was very angry, but his philosophy was to accept life as it
                            goes. This was what motivated him to work on the pile and find someone.
                            He wants “generations to remember this.” During this time, Ron had to
                            deal with the death of two friends from a firehouse next to the one that
                            he worked for. He also mentioned that the City of New York had lost 343
                            firefighters. Ron attended numerous funerals after the disaster of 9/11.
                            He noticed that a greater brotherhood has also developed between the
                            Nassau and Suffolk County fire departments after the WTC attacks. Ron
                            has become an advocate for firefighters with cancer. He is more
                            spiritual and more reconciled with his Roman Catholic faith. This helps
                            him through his fears. He has also become an advocate for FEMA (Federal
                            Emergency Management Association) and said in his interview, “You have
                            to live for the living”. Ron mentioned that the layperson has no idea of
                            what it was like down there--only the firemen, the policemen and the
                            utility workers knew what happened. Ron does not want anyone to feel
                            what he feels and he wants to reassure people that they don’t have to
                            face their health issues alone. The final words in Ron’s interview were
                            “Why do people fight among themselves? They should live and let
                            live.”

       Richard was asleep at home when his stepfather called him about the
                            attacks on 9/11. Richard worked as a NYPD officer and was soon called
                            into his precinct in Brooklyn, New York. At the time, he lived on
                            Roosevelt Island. He hitched a ride on a truck and was questioning
                            whether he should go to Ground Zero or to the precinct. He decided to go
                            to the precinct, and he was one of the first officers to arrive. When he
                            arrived he was told the towers had just collapsed. Over the radio, he
                            could hear the cops calling for help. He has guilt that he chose to go
                            to the precinct rather than straight to the site, and that if he had
                            been there, maybe he could have saved someone. At the time he assumed
                            that the PD had lost hundreds of officers. The husband of one of the
                            officers at his precinct was ESU, and he was killed. There were several
                            officers from his precinct missing. For a time that first day he
                            directed traffic by the highway in Brooklyn, and remembers feeling
                            terrible that he had to turn away all the civilian cars because streets
                            were open only to emergency personnel. Richard had no information for
                            those people, either, as he was there without a radio. He got into a
                            physical altercation with one person, who had expressed a wish that more
                            cops would have died that day. He recalls that while they were getting
                            ready to mobilize, a sergeant shot and killed a dog that hung out near
                            the station, claiming that it had tried to attack him. Richard suspects
                            he did this to get out of going to the site. Eventually they loaded into
                            buses to go there--no one knew what to expect. Once there, Richard
                            remarks it was like a "science fiction movie." Richard recounts a story
                            of lending his flashlight to someone who claimed there were firemen
                            trapped in a hole, and when he didn't return, they consulted nearby
                            workers, to find out it was untrue and that the person might have been
                            mentally ill. They were also told of a copy who had been trapped and
                            injured, and when found, it was discovered that he had taken his own
                            life. He says now that it was too hard to grasp what was happening, and
                            that, "When I think about it now I felt like I was there, but I wasn’t
                            there, but I was there." Eventually he stopped leaving the pile when the
                            collapse alarms would sound, figuring that there was nothing he could
                            really do. At the time he believed there were people alive and trapped.
                            The first time he went home, he was driving on the LIE on his motorcycle
                            and was rear-ended. Richard also talked about POPPA and International
                            Critical Incident Stress Foundation; with their guidance he helped set
                            up debriefing for officers, which was met with resistance. They
                            counseled many officers and oversaw daily self-care activities, and
                            overcame many hurdles to do so, and it's something he's very proud of.
                            He worked particularly hard to get services for officers at the
                            landfill. Richard recalls the many strange things that happened on and
                            around the pile, including people who seemed to make up stories about
                            who they were. Two months before this interview, one of Richard's
                            friends died of 9/11-related cancer. He knew a few others who have also
                            died of 9/11-related illness. Richard says that his work with POPPA gave
                            him a lot of tools that have helped him cope over time. He worries that
                            people and the government haven't learned enough from 9/11.

       Stacey is a teacher. Her parents divorced when she was a child, and she
                            split her time between Oregon and New York. When she got older, she
                            wanted to teach in New York and found a position in Chinatown. At
                            present, she teaches 8th grade in the East Village of New York and has
                            three children. On the morning of 9/11, Stacey had her students working
                            on a project. She was in a classroom with no direct view of the towers
                            when they heard a tremendous bang. She was unsure of what the noise was.
                            The teacher across the hall came over and said there was some kind of
                            explosion. She crossed the hall to a room where she could see the WTC
                            and saw a jagged hole, huge flames with black smoke. She became weak in
                            the knees. The teachers decided to bring all the children (13 and 14
                            year olds) together in one classroom where the view was. In the end this
                            decision tortured and haunted her because the students saw the second
                            plane hit. The students screamed and they saw people jumping from the
                            buildings. The children jumped on tables and chairs—it seemed to be a
                            weird physical reaction. Stacy went back to her classroom and listened
                            to the radio. She recalled the students asking if the towers would fall
                            on them. She told the students the towers could not fall down. She then
                            heard a terrible rumbling that felt like an earthquake. Someone came in
                            and told her the buildings fell. Stacy felt she made bad decisions by
                            making promises to the children. The teachers were waiting for direction
                            and none came. The teachers did not know how to act: they were anxious
                            and did not want to send students out of the building. The students were
                            crying. Stacy didn’t know whether it was “done” or there was more to
                            come. Stacy kept the students in the classroom for the whole day and
                            gave them paper and watercolors to distract them and help time pass.
                            Stacy’s husband, Brian, came to the school. The school was at the foot
                            of the Manhattan Bridge. The principal came in at the end of the day and
                            thanked everyone. The principal told the teachers no child was to be
                            released; their parents were coming to get them. There were three
                            students left at the end of the day. Stacey and her husband walked them
                            home. Stacey and her husband eventually reached their home. They heard
                            NYC public schools were closed until that Friday. The anxiety was
                            building. Their apartment was close to Houston Street. They had to show
                            ID to get to their building. On either Thursday or Friday, they walked
                            uptown through police barricades. Stacey recalled the awful smells in
                            their neighborhood. Stacey returned to work on Monday. The school
                            building was a shocking sight, in the atrium of the school a huge
                            communications center had been created. There were tables and wires
                            everywhere. The Red Cross was there. It felt like a war zone. The
                            responders took showers in the locker room. The principal advised the
                            teachers to just “make the children feel safe.” Stacey felt none of them
                            should be there. She continued to teach and it was “a year not like any
                            other year.” The eighth graders were kind and sensitive. Chinatown was
                            impacted by the events. The tourism and restaurant jobs were gone; they
                            were economically devastated by 9/11. Neighborhood police presence
                            caused anxiety over undocumented aliens. Stacey became worried about
                            students. The Chinese way was to not ask for help. The experience was
                            intense both living and working downtown during this time. Stacey and
                            her family left lower Manhattan last spring and moved to Brooklyn. She
                            became a literacy coach. It took her ten years to “be in charge again.”
                            9/11 impacted Stacey personally. It sped her decision to start a family
                            and she had twins. It gave her perspective on life.

       William and his wife used to go to the Winter Garden overlooking the
                            Hudson on Sundays. After 9/11 all he saw was broken glass and beams. He
                            wanted to jump out of his skin and beat someone, he was so angry. He
                            doesn’t go there anymore...he stays away. William lives on 36th street
                            in NYC. On the morning of 9/11, he heard the sirens. He turned on the TV
                            in time to see the 2nd plane hit. His office was only a few blocks away
                            so he hurried in. People were in panic mode. He had a corner office
                            facing Water Street. He could see throngs of people trudging down the
                            street covered in dust. It was like Night of the Living Dead. He will
                            never forget the sight. He worked through the day and went to the site.
                            How could this happen? How could someone have this much anger towards
                            us? The energy of Law Enforcement was incredible. We’re going to
                            overtake this windmill, he said. Technically, William was still a police
                            officer even though he was retired and running the POPPA organization.
                            POPPA, which stands for Police Officers Providing Peer Assistance, was
                            designed to assist police officers in crisis. It was set up because
                            William realized how many officers committed suicide due to depression,
                            stress, and other mental health issues, and felt there was a way to help
                            those suffering. William went home the first night but he couldn’t
                            sleep. He knew there was a lot to be done. Because his office had been
                            damaged, he was offered space in the Federal Reserve Building. A mini
                            crisis office was set up on the 2nd day. It was filled with boxes and
                            orange crates. It was new and exciting but crazy. He worked 4 days
                            straight trying to get ready for the demand he knew would be coming. He
                            ended up being forced to take a day off because he realized that he
                            himself was in need of mental health counseling. He was beginning to
                            have a meltdown. Self-care is something that is required and mandatory
                            for every POPPA counselor. Mental health coordinators and crisis
                            intervention counselors were ready for the incoming forces. Many were to
                            come. When asked what drove him to work 4 days straight, William said
                            “9/11 was evil against humanity”. Over 5,000 officers were seen in a 10
                            month period after 9/11. A good friend named John Coughlin lost his life
                            due 9/11. Coughlin was an inspiration to him. William says he’s a better
                            person since 9/11. He stands up for what he believes in and he is more
                            sensitive to the needs of others. The world is filled with humanity,
                            good, and evil. This was a wakeup call. It was the epitome of evil.

       Donald lives in Stony Brook and has been with the Suffolk County Police
                            Department Emergency Service Unit—Bomb Squad and Hazardous Material--for
                            26 years. On 9/11, Donald was at MacArthur Airport on Long Island at
                            training when he saw the event unfold on TV. He called his wife and
                            headed to the city. About 10-12 officers and a sergeant packed gear and
                            went to the staging area at Floyd Bennett Field. While driving there, he
                            heard the towers had collapsed. He assumed it was a rescue mission—he
                            had done trainings in the WTC many times. He felt anxious and when the
                            group arrived at Floyd Bennett, he could see the smoke and dust. At 2 PM
                            they got the ok to go to the site via the Brooklyn Bridge. Donald
                            described crushed rescue vehicles; vehicles and people covered in gray
                            soot, dazed and exhausted both physically and emotionally. He reached
                            the pile. The debris was 10-15 stories high with no place to start.
                            There was a fire burning in the mound of debris; it was impossible to
                            approach. People were on the pile with no direction—it was mass
                            confusion. On 9/12 he was assigned to a certain area on the pile. Once
                            he was on the pile, he felt there was no chance of anyone being rescued
                            and that it was a hopeless cause. He recovered numerous bodies. His
                            friend, a fellow police officer, was rescued and had numerous operations
                            so that he could walk again. He was on the pile on 9/11, 9/12, and 9/13.
                            At one point while carrying a body he slipped into a void. The body fell
                            on him, causing an injury to his right hip. The pile was treacherous.
                            Because of his injury, he was forced to go home. The most difficult part
                            of working on the pile was finding mementos and police and firemen
                            apparatus. His main motivation for working at Ground Zero was
                            patriotism. He arrived at the Fresh Kills landfill via helicopter on
                            9/22/01. Conveyer belts were set up, it was a crime scene. There were
                            people going through debris. A fellow officer found two people in a car.
                            Donald stayed at the landfill on and off for three months until the end
                            of December. He became tired towards the end of his time at the
                            landfill, where he worked 12-14 hour days. Donald explained that police
                            training has changed as a result of 9/11. The training has gone from
                            minimal to large catastrophes. He feels an attack could happen again. A
                            neighbor, a captain in the FDNY, perished at Ground Zero. Donald
                            described the funeral and the tremendous outpouring of support. After
                            9/11, Donald travelled extensively throughout the US. He feels the event
                            was lost to people outside of the tristate area. Donald thinks the
                            cleanup of Ground Zero could have been more organized and the approval
                            of air quality was a lie. The government did not give out proper
                            equipment. He feels a lot of lessons were learned and the only heroes of
                            9/11 were the people who went into buildings for rescue. Donald would
                            definitely do it again if needed. He said he is not a hero; he was just
                            doing his job. “We are rescue workers—part of what we do.” He believes
                            9/11 was an eye-opener for the government not to stick its head in the
                            sand.

       Audrey and Dan are married. They both come from law enforcement families.
                            Audrey had been married to firefighter Jack Fanning for 18 years until
                            they divorced. Jack was a well known fireman who died on 9/11. They had
                            3 children together, Ryan, Jeremy, and Jacqueline, all in law
                            enforcement in one way or the other. Although this interview was given
                            by Audrey and Dan, it was also very much about Jack and the children he
                            had with Audrey. Some background on Jack Fanning that was obtained from
                            the Jack Fanning Memorial Foundation website: When Jack was 31, he was
                            promoted to Lieutenant and just 5 years later he was promoted to
                            Captain. In 1992 he was again promoted to Executive Officer/Technical
                            Services. Two years later he was promoted to Battalion Chief of Fleet
                            and Technical Services. In 1996 Jack was named Battalion Chief of
                            Hazardous Operations for the entire FDNY. Jack’s final heroic act took
                            place on September 11, 2001, when he first responded to the call at the
                            World Trade Center. Jack arrived on the scene as the 2nd hijacked plane
                            piloted itself into Tower Two. He was last seen at the command post in
                            the South Tower and had sent a member of the NYC Office of Emergency
                            Management to locate medical personnel to provide assistance to victims
                            coming down from the upper levels. Tower Two collapsed less than 1 hour
                            after he arrived on that horrific scene. Only his charred white helmet
                            was found in the rubble in March 2002. On the morning of 9/11, Dan had
                            just finished the night shift. Audrey called him at home and told him to
                            turn on the TV, where he saw the 2nd plane hit. On 9/12, Dan, along with
                            his 2 stepsons who worked for the Sheriff’s Department, went to search
                            for Jack. Because Jack was so well know, Dan and his stepsons were
                            escorted by the fire department into Ground Zero to assist with search
                            and rescue. A crane actually picked them up and dropped them in the
                            center of the pile. Dan recalls walking across beams, it was like an
                            inferno and their shoes were melting. It was like the end of the world;
                            a movie set. He was in shock about how this could have happened to his
                            city. Dan's stepson Jeremy was only there for a few days because his
                            young daughter had kidney cancer and he was dealing with that. Dan
                            returned for about a month until he was asked to leave by the fire and
                            police departments who were controlling the pile at that time. Dan’s
                            other stepson, Ryan, stayed to continue looking for his father. Because
                            there was conflict with the sheriff’s department, where Ryan worked, he
                            dressed in a fire uniform so he would go unnoticed and he remained
                            searching for his father for several months. There was always a power
                            struggle between the two forces. Audrey states that when Dan returned
                            home from being at Ground Zero, his clothes smelled of death. Audrey
                            also says that she will never be whole again, that she has been living
                            outside her body and nothing will ever be the same. Ryan has been ill
                            since 9/11 and can no longer work. Dan has some health issues as well
                            but copes as best as he can. Dan says that no one is immune to the evil,
                            that society should be aware because there is evil out there.

       Micki is the Health and Safety Director of the CWA (Communications
                            Workers of America) and lives in Queens, NY. Her role is to make sure
                            workers are protected. On 9/11, she took a 6 AM flight to LaGuardia from
                            Buffalo, NY and went directly to her office four blocks east of the WTC.
                            At the time of the attack, she was on a city bus headed to a meeting
                            when she heard someone say, “it’s a war—we’re under attack.” She could
                            see the tower and smoke from the bus. She exited the bus and went into a
                            court building, which was evacuated shortly after she entered. She found
                            another bus and got on and tried to reach her husband on the phone.
                            There were rumors on the bus—she reached her sister on the phone and her
                            sister said the towers were gone. Micki was shocked and worried for her
                            husband and for all the workers. Micki did not return to her office
                            until the Monday after 9/11. She rode on a silent subway; the streets
                            were white from the dust and deserted. Windows were broken and the
                            towers were gone. The first few weeks were chaotic—communication was not
                            good. The Verizon workers, part of CWA, were responsible for getting the
                            Stock Exchange up and running. Questions were raised about dust,
                            asbestos, etc. Health concerns were less in the beginning because of the
                            tragedy of the event. Things changed rapidly, government agencies became
                            involved: EPA, OSHA, etc., and deemed the air ok. Micki’s role was to
                            determine if this information was accurate. The government agencies
                            allowed companies to be less protective than they should have
                            been—respirators were voluntary—there was no training and no fit
                            testing. In early October, Micki went to Ground Zero to meet with the
                            Verizon Health and Safety Director. Her role was to check on CWA members
                            which include a large variety of workers—Verizon, Lucent, ATT, traffic
                            enforcement, sanitation workers, nurses at NYU Hospital, Port Authority
                            workers, and broadcast and engineer techs. Local union leadership dealt
                            with many of the issues. Health and safety concerns changed to health
                            concerns; there was much conflicting information. These concerns grew in
                            October of 2001. Micki feels things are “still not being done with the
                            way it should be done.” She spent time on and off the site over the next
                            few months until mid-December. At the time, other 9/11 issues were
                            raised—people asking if they could return to their offices, and Anthrax
                            scares. Micki had to fight against the Bush Administration’s demand that
                            workers get the smallpox vaccine (no purpose). Micki believes 9/11
                            continues to this day. There has never been an assessment of
                            contamination in workplaces or residences surrounding Ground Zero. The
                            issues were blatantly ignored—science was trusted to validate one
                            viewpoint and has come back to haunt us. She battled the EPA. Senator
                            Hillary Clinton got the EPA to set up an Expert Review Panel to review
                            unmet health needs of workers and Micki was the liaison. The Panel did
                            nothing and ended prematurely. She was angry, and still is. Politicians,
                            i.e., Bush and Giuliani, said “go back to work and go shopping.” Micki
                            feels we will never know the extent of health exposures due to financial
                            interests. “It all happened again after Katrina and the Deep Water
                            Horizon Spill.” Because issues have not been resolved, it provides Micki
                            with motivation. “There needs to be a better formulation for a response
                            from the government. The government does not take a pro-active
                            approach.” Some positives were gained as a result of the event:
                            Community advocates came together to fight issues and would do things
                            differently in the future. There are still people suffering, so Micki
                            cannot stop in her quest to create a safer workplace. 9/11 changed her
                            life and how she views information from the government—she is much more
                            cynical. Events are short-term but health is long-term. The needs of
                            workers are important to do this kind of work—financial, physical and
                            mental. “9/11 for each person will never end.” Micki hopes there is a
                            willingness to do the right thing in the future.

       Joseph was a firefighter stationed in Midtown Manhattan in Fire Patrol
                            #1. He lives in Lindenhurst on Long Island. While listening to the radio
                            on the morning of 9/11, Joseph heard that an airplane had hit the World
                            Trade Center. He jumped on the departing rig of the fire truck, as it
                            left for the site, travelling the distance down Seventh Avenue. He could
                            see the main fuselage of the plane sticking out of the WTC tower as they
                            drove and ended up by the site at Broadway and Vesey streets. He waited
                            with his company for instructions. After the second plane hit the other
                            tower, he and the patrol received instructions to head in for rescue. As
                            Joseph approached the building he saw a person fall to his death and
                            land 10 feet away from him. Joseph then turned toward his lieutenant and
                            stated that he did not think he could climb 60 flights of stairs during
                            the rescue attempts. Joseph had been a carpenter before his firefighting
                            career and he had the feeling that the buildings were going to collapse.
                            He watched helplessly and prayed as he watched over 50 people jumped to
                            their deaths. To this day Joseph experiences PTSD symptoms when he hears
                            loud noises. All of the members of the patrol did not have enough time
                            to deal with the situation, but tried as best as they could. They were
                            given masks for protection but the intense smoke and fumes caused some
                            of the men to regurgitate. Then the building started to collapse, as
                            Joseph had thought it would. He talked about how one of his patrol
                            buddies never made it out of the building; of how he thought he would
                            never see his family again, although he did eventually manage to drive
                            home to Lindenhurst. During the time he spent on the rescue and recovery
                            process, Joseph witnessed people come from the Chicago Fire Department
                            and other places around the country to help out. Joseph worked on the
                            bucket brigade on “The Pile.” These events and experiences of 9/11
                            changed him. He became more alert and emotional because of the sights
                            and smells he experienced at Ground Zero. Joseph sometimes shares his
                            stories with other responders because it is easier to talk to cops, fire
                            fighters, and people who have been through similar experiences. Joseph
                            also lost some residents of his hometown on 9/11. Joseph feels that the
                            city has turned its back on his fire patrol since 9/11. After nearly 150
                            years of operation they shut the patrol down. In his reflections, Joseph
                            believes he would have gone into the building if he had had more
                            training in high rise rescues. He says, in retrospect, “You are always
                            going to have doubts.” He also believes that when the worst happens,
                            “Humanity steps up,” that generally people are good, but sometimes the
                            feeling just does not last long enough.

       Glenn has been a Local 3 Union Electrician for 28 years. He is still
                            working in NYC. On 9/11, Glenn had taken the LIRR to Penn Station and
                            sat with his friend, Ralph. He then took a subway to the downtown area.
                            He was across the highway from the WTC working in a building on the 20th
                            floor at the time of the attacks. At 8:45 AM he heard a giant noise and
                            saw two carpenters jumped from a scaffold. He looked down to the street
                            and described it as “unrecognizable with lots of paper flying around.”
                            He recalled being at the WTC for the first bombing when he was having
                            lunch and his chair came off the ground. He was working with about 100
                            men, and they all evacuated the building. When he got to the street, the
                            sights were overwhelming--people jumping to their death and crawling
                            from the debris. He headed to the highway and saw body parts everywhere.
                            He could not comprehend what he was seeing. He heard an extremely loud
                            sound – the second plane hitting. He both saw and felt the fireball one
                            block away. He felt the heat and saw terror he will never forget on an
                            Asian girl’s face. He went into survival mode; he thought more planes
                            were coming. He and his partner headed toward the Hudson River in an
                            attempt to get to Penn Station. A police officer tried to prevent him
                            and he pushed him out of the way. He wanted to go north and fought his
                            way through throngs of people. He thought of jumping in the river to
                            escape. He was amazed at the amount of women’s shoes in the streets—100s
                            of them and laptops scattered about. He saw the hole in the north tower.
                            He worked his way north and saw a fellow electrician, a woman, crying.
                            He grabbed her and got on a bus. Glenn recalled that he was supposed to
                            be on the 99th floor of the WTC on 9/11, until a last minute change in
                            his work schedule. He finally reached Penn Station and said it was like
                            WWII. It was dead silent and surreal—people were standing around
                            listening to car radios. F-16s were flying overhead. He could not get
                            home because Penn Station was closed. Four hours later, it reopened and
                            he was able to get a train to Long Island. He fell apart when he got
                            home. For days he watched the events unfold on TV. He discovered his
                            friend, Ralph, who he travelled with each day on the LIRR, had been
                            killed. He lost a total of eight friends on 9/11. He feels fortunate to
                            have survived but later became very angry. Glenn went back to work the
                            following Monday--a few blocks from Ground Zero putting microwave dishes
                            on the top of a building. Debris covered the top of the building. He was
                            shocked that his company sent him back to the area. He was sent to
                            Ground Zero to pick up other electricians’ tools. The smell was
                            horrendous—“the smell of construction and death.” He worked for a few
                            days in the downtown area and then did not return until February. The
                            pile of debris had lessened, but there were electrical cables all over
                            the ground—it was dangerous. Oil tanks and generators were everywhere.
                            In February, he was sent to work at the Winter Garden, a building that
                            was mostly glass and was totally destroyed during the attacks. Glenn was
                            happy to be there and help to rebuild. He was there 10 hours a day, 7
                            days a week. He spoke of amazing people from the Salvation Army with
                            supplies of boots, gloves, food, counseling, etc. His motivation to work
                            in the area was pride and “to do the right thing.” He believes
                            responders risked both their physical and mental health and “we should
                            not be forgotten.” He felt it was more important to help the country
                            than his own health. He said, “A lot of selfless people were down
                            there.” He felt patriotic. Glenn began to have problems about 4-5 years
                            after 9/11. Initially he thought he was over it, but he became very
                            angry until he hit rock bottom. His girlfriend and his children
                            suffered. He feels better now due to counseling, etc., and is now
                            getting back “in the groove.” He feels he has finally dealt with it and
                            is feeling very good lately. He now realizes what is important and has
                            become a very thoughtful person. He believes the event will never be
                            over for any New Yorker and it is still fresh in their minds. There were
                            no positives he gained from his experience and believes we will be
                            attacked again although he has begun to let his guard down a little bit.
                            He still goes to NYC each day and thinks it is not good for him mentally
                            as it causes flashbacks. He feels some Muslims knew of the attacks, and
                            mentioned there were no coffee carts in the area on 9/11 and he saw
                            people celebrating at a mosque in Queens.

       Steven was born in the Brooklyn Projects in 1959. At age 19 he obtained a
                            job as an EMS and was stationed permanently at Coney Island Hospital. He
                            went on to become a court officer as well as an EMS. He started taking
                            photographs in 1977 for the department. With this background he
                            volunteered in 1989 for the fire department and started shooting videos
                            for them. Danielle, Steven’s daughter, was born on September 7, 2001,
                            while he was working in the Brooklyn County Court as senior court clerk.
                            The morning of September 11, Steven was at home. Around 9 AM he started
                            hearing about a plane crashing into the tower, so he grabbed his camera
                            equipment and headed to the scene via the Triborough Bridge. He shot
                            many pictures including people watching the scene, the collapse of
                            Building 7 next to the WTC, and the sites adjacent to the World Trade
                            Center. He also took graphic pictures of smoldering fires and smoke
                            spreading across the WTC sites. He mentions the story of Ladder Six
                            being a miracle. Due to the air conditions, he needed his eyes washed
                            out by the treatment center there. As a photographer for the fire
                            department, he witnessed a lot and was able to maintain equilibrium, but
                            this was very traumatic for him. He worried that his wife knew that he
                            was there. Steven’s passion as a child for firefighting grew into an
                            equal passion for his photography as an adult. He returned to the site
                            for more pictures on September 29, 2001. Much work had been done since
                            he had been there, but he still saw fires and smoke rising. He saw boot
                            washing stations and in talking to the workers learned most of them were
                            from FEMA, the FDNY, and the police department. He remarked that “too
                            many were killed for nothing.” The thought of all of those families who
                            were affected by the tragedy motivated him to return to the site this
                            day. By documenting his story, Steven feels that the public will be more
                            understanding of what took place that morning. He feels that the real
                            heroes were those responders who are normally involved in the public
                            services such as firefighters and police officers. Steven now suffers
                            with RADS (reactive airways disease syndrome), sinus infections, and
                            GERD. He also has PTSD which makes him anxious and jumpy. He states “God
                            does things for different reasons we don’t understand why.” He says his
                            life has been divided into two; pre-9/11 and post-9/11.

        The "Ground Zero Video" is Mr. Spak's footage of responders working
                                to recover bodies at Ground Zero. Note that the Ground Zero Video

       Eddie was raised in the projects and later moved to the Bushwick section
                            of Brooklyn. His mother was Puerto Rican and his father was American
                            Indian and Scottish. He attended public schools and many members of his
                            extended family were public servants. When Eddie was younger, he went
                            through a period feeling lost. He didn’t know what he wanted to do with
                            his life. His dad told him to take all the civil service exams he could
                            and see which ones he did well on. He had thought at one time, he would
                            like to be a marine biologist but he ended up being a police officer,
                            like his father. Eddie worked as a foot patrolman for the 83rd precinct.
                            One of the areas he covered was Hope Gardens, an area that his father
                            helped to build. Everyone in the area knew Eddie, and he was very proud
                            to have grown up in the projects and then work in an area where he knew
                            so many people. He felt he was a role model for the younger kids. Eddie
                            was a beat officer for 10 years. On the morning of 9/11, his wife was at
                            school and he was at a local deli with his daughter in Greenpoint. His
                            daughter, who was 4 years old at the time said, “Daddy, look at the
                            plane.” He looked up and saw the belly of the plane overhead. It was the
                            clearest day ever and he could see the towers. He saw the plane heading
                            for the tower and knew something was wrong. The plane disappeared behind
                            a building and just then the 2nd tower exploded. Eddie took his daughter
                            home, and he waited for his wife who was down by 7th avenue at the
                            Swedish School for Massage. She walked over the 59th Street Bridge into
                            Long Island City, before she could find her way home to Greenpoint.
                            Eddie left as soon as she got home and reported for duty. He arrived at
                            the precinct and was given flares, lights, batteries, gloves (no masks),
                            and then he headed to Ground Zero. He was feeling numb and frustrated.
                            Why would anyone do this to us? He drove around and it was like all of
                            Manhattan had been evacuated. Everything was covered in dust; it was
                            eerie, scary, and gloomy, like one of those plague movies. The smell was
                            indescribable. It was a combination of jet fuel and bodies. He was
                            assigned to take away cameras from anyone in the surrounding area who
                            took pictures, whether it was the media or tourists. He rode around the
                            perimeter trying to get closer to the center, but he was nervous. He
                            also patrolled the surrounding areas and said that looting was a
                            problem. The firemen worked really hard and the steelworkers were
                            phenomenal. They had to perform delicate removal of steel beams; cutting
                            and moving them on barges. Things were more organized as time went on.
                            He remembers stopping at a Burger King that was feeding anyone in need.
                            He had a frozen pie in one hand and he was smoking a cigarette in the
                            other. His partners laughed at him. Eddie found no one, dead or alive.
                            At one point he realized that other responders were wearing masks and so
                            he found one. He went back to the precinct that night to clean up and he
                            slept there the first night. The next day he was assigned to assisting
                            the firemen and patrolling the roads. He said the firemen worked very
                            hard. He knew they lost a lot of people. Eddie said he went back every
                            day because he had a sense of duty. He took a sworn oath and he had an
                            obligation to help others. At one point, volunteers were sought after to
                            go to Fresh Kills landfill, so Eddie went. For about 2 months on the
                            weekends he went; suited in a Tyvek suit and mask with his arms and legs
                            duct taped to keep the debris out of the openings. Names of the workers
                            were written into their boots, so they could be identified if anything
                            happened. Cars were hosed down when they left. Cranes would dump debris
                            from barges and then the task would be to sift and if you found
                            anything, put it in the bucket for later identification. The ground was
                            bubbling under him; it was what he expected Mars to be like. Eddie
                            believes that the love of mankind existed on 9/11; that everyone
                            answered the call to duty on that day. He said there was togetherness
                            and camaraderie. The Red Cross and restaurants that stayed open were
                            phenomenal. Eddie believes that people involved in 9/11 used each other
                            for strength and that was inspiring to him. He is happy and proud to
                            have been a part of that. His advice to others is to "Enjoy your life,
                            live righteously and with respect towards others. Always be at your best
                            even when others are at their worst." After 9/11, Eddie left the city
                            and moved to Long Island because he was afraid for his family. In 2006,
                            after putting in his 10 years, he retired. He loves being out east in
                            what he calls "farm country." When he wakes up he sees rabbits and deer
                            and at night he sees the raccoons. He loves music and plays a guitar. He
                            spends his time by the water soaking in life and the nature that
                            surrounds him. For Eddie, this may have been a necessary part of his
                            healing. He lives with his wife and young daughter.

       George worked as an elevator mechanic for the NYPD on 9/11. He was
                            working at One Police Plaza within sight of the WTC towers. One Police
                            Plaza served as a communication hub for the NYPD. On the morning of
                            9/11, he recalled feeling his building shake, and hearing sirens from
                            fire engines and rescue vehicles from all over the place. One Police
                            Plaza later became a triage center for the American Red Cross. It was
                            set up with cots, eyewash stations, and other medical equipment. George
                            was involved in keeping the communication system up and running. His
                            orders to work came from the chief of the department. He worked out a
                            schedule with other staff at the building, and stayed at his post for
                            more than a week at One Police Plaza. He was fitted by NIOSH with a
                            respirator. He worked eight hour shifts. George also did the piping for
                            the electricity to run the power washes, so they could clean up rescue
                            vehicles and radiators covered with fine dust from the debris. He
                            observed that the camaraderie of the workers was “exceptional” and that
                            “no one discussed their paycheck.” While performing his duties, George
                            was motivated most by memory of the people lost in the towers.

       Emanuel was a Verizon field technician on 9/11/2001. Around 9/20/2001 he
                            went down to the site, near Canal Street. He worked in the surrounding
                            buildings, restoring communications. He describes the scene as
                            ‘organized chaos.’ There were various enforcement agencies such as FBI,
                            CIA, Secret Service, and federal marshals that had set up tents in the
                            area. He remembers that everything was covered with dust, and that there
                            was a distinct odor in the area. Trucks would come by at 5-6 A.M. to
                            wash the streets, but otherwise everything was covered with gray mud. He
                            also remembers the cars parked along the West Side Highway were covered
                            with dust from the collapse. Emanuel and his crew stayed at a midtown
                            Manhattan hotel surveying and repairing communications around the WTC
                            area by Vesey Street and Canal Street. They commuted by van to the WTC
                            site. Emanuel remembers checkpoints with law enforcement personnel at
                            every corner. As it was a high security area, Emanuel and his crew had
                            to show identification badges to get near the site. During the first two
                            weeks, they were surveying the area, and Emanuel remembers that no one
                            was allowed by the South Street Seaport area---except them. Emanuel
                            worked at the site from about 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. through mid-October 2001.
                            It was a 24-hour operation. He remembers that he got up at 5:30 am
                            everyday to get to work by the South Street Seaport area, and by the
                            Federal Court Building. He worked primarily on digital and high capacity
                            communication lines. Duty compelled him to return to the site for work
                            every day. He felt that people came together after the WTC attacks and
                            states, “ You have to do what you can do, the best you can do.” Emanuel
                            retired June of 2010 after 40 years of service. He commends the WTC
                            Monitoring Program and feels that people here are very helpful.

       Tony was out on medical leave when 9/11 occurred. He had been stationed
                            in Brooklyn to Rescue 2. He turned on the TV and saw what was happening.
                            He put on his uniform and told his wife that he had to go. He remembers
                            it being a beautiful sunny day when he headed on. There was a caravan of
                            cars in the HOV lane heading to Ground Zero. He remembers as he got
                            closer to the center, people were running towards him trying to leave
                            the area. He arrived just after the 2nd building went down. There was a
                            cloud of smoke, dust, and debris everywhere. He parked his car and went
                            on foot. He immediately saw part of a person on the ground and part of a
                            plane wheel on the ground. He began to think about other fireman and a
                            command structure. He made his way to the pile, where things were
                            hectic. Firemen were looking for their brothers. There was an
                            overwhelming feeling of "Where do I start?" At one point he remembers
                            the command center telling everyone to turn off their radios so they
                            could hear if anyone was calling for help. The silence was eerie. No one
                            was heard. He came upon a fire truck that had been crushed with all its
                            men inside, all dead. He found no one alive. He stayed until 2:00am on
                            the first day and went back the next day. There were fires and debris
                            everywhere. He returned for 2 months, going home every night and calling
                            his wife every day during the day. It was a deal he made with her. After
                            the 2 months, his wife was diagnosed with cancer and he stopped going to
                            stay home and take care of his wife. He was tired, discouraged and
                            determined to find someone alive but he never did. He said he went back
                            every day to try and find the missing because he knew they would do the
                            same for him. There was a brotherhood and they were all special. He went
                            to countless funerals and on some days he went to three in a row It was
                            a tough time for everyone. He has a vivid memory from that first day. He
                            was sitting on debris looking toward the sky. A dust cloud moved and the
                            sun peaked through. He saw a military helicopter overhead. It was flying
                            so low that he could see the men sitting on the edge of the copter with
                            their machine guns propped up ready to fire. Military were on the ground
                            as well. In 1993, Tony was stationed on Staten Island when the 1st Trade
                            Center attack occurred. He knew at that time that this could happen
                            again. 9/11 took the best of the best. People are more alert now; more
                            aware of their surrounds. If physically able, he claims he would do it
                            again. For now, Tony says you should live your life; be vigilant and
                            alert.

       Raymond was a field technician for Verizon on 9-11-2001. He went to
                            Ground Zero on 9/13/2001 to volunteer to splice cables. He and 26 of his
                            co-workers went down by city bus and he remembered people cheering and
                            clapping for them. Raymond recalls the presence of Army and National
                            Guard troops along the way to the site. Raymond arrived at the site and
                            was given a red card, which indicated that had permission to be at
                            Ground Zero. He reported to the Verizon building downtown and was in the
                            vault within the building to fix up all the cables. At first, he wasn’t
                            provided with the right filters for a respirator, and the respirator did
                            not protect him from the diesel vapors in the air. Raymond worked 12-16
                            hour shifts, 7 days a week for 21 days straight before he could take a
                            day off. He was involved in restoring communications, pulling cables up
                            to adjacent high rise buildings and splicing these cables. Raymond’s
                            main job was to get the Stock Exchange communications back up and
                            running. Raymond recalled seeing several helpers from the American Red
                            Cross and America Cares organizations. He was “amazed” at the
                            coordination of the Red Cross. At St. Paul’s Church, he remembers that
                            they had podiatrists giving foot massages. He stated, “People did
                            everything they could to accommodate the workers.” Raymond felt he was
                            lied to about regarding the air quality. He remembers coming home, and
                            when he blew his nose, the mucus came out black because of the soot and
                            pollution in the air. Raymond considers members of the rescue and
                            recovery teams as the real heroes of the time. After his experience,
                            Raymond realizes that, “Some people suffer more than others in this
                            world.”

       Carl is married and has 2 adopted daughters. He has PTSD and has been
                            undergoing treatment at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital for virtual
                            reality desensitizing. It took him 1-1/2 years after 9/11 before he
                            could go back into the E train subway under the WTC. Carl was working at
                            195 Broadway behind the Millennium Hotel when 9/11 occurred. He was a
                            supervising mechanical engineer with a 7 man crew. That morning of 9/11
                            he had just come off the E train with a box of Krispy Kreme donuts for
                            his crew. He went into his building and shortly thereafter, he heard a
                            loud explosion. He looked out the window and saw papers flying and
                            sparks everywhere. He went to the Fulton Street side of the building and
                            saw the black outline across the tower. He was told it was a plane. When
                            the 2nd plane hit, he saw the fireball come down onto the street. People
                            started running everywhere but mostly they ran into his building. His
                            building at 195 Broadway and the Millennium Hotel connected. He walked
                            through to the lobby and people were everywhere. A wide screen TV was
                            showing the plane as it hit. He realized then that it was no accident.
                            He said, “Oh my God.” He found his co-worker Rubin and then went to
                            check the floors for damage. Most all of the employees had already left
                            the building. Up on the 8th floor he heard hail. He lifted a shade and
                            saw the tower coming down. There was rumbling and shaking.. he ran like
                            hell and then all of a sudden all the air conditioning alarms went off
                            due to the heat. He went back down to the lobby and it was covered with
                            dust, debris, and smoke. The OTIS elevator workman had been working on
                            the elevators and they saw him standing outside. Rubin and Carl ran out
                            and grabbed him. He couldn’t see. He was completely covered in dust.
                            They took him down several levels in the building to find a place where
                            they could clean out his eyes and then they returned to the lobby. As he
                            entered the lobby, he saw a fire fighter come crashing through the
                            glass. Just then the 2nd building fell. Another fire storm of dust,
                            debris, and glass came gushing into the hotel lobby. People’s faces were
                            pressed against the windows. When he went outside, it was like a scene
                            from Universal Studios. It was a snow storm, white/gray ash; fire trucks
                            on fire. His first breath of air was burning his eyes and lungs. A
                            policeman ran by and Carl heard him say “I lost him, I lost my rookie.”
                            He left the area with another worker that had a heart condition. Carl
                            wanted to make sure his friend got home safely. They started walking
                            towards Greenwich Village and in that area, it was like nothing
                            happened. People were sitting outside eating, watching TV. He met
                            someone who had been working on the 80th floor of the tower that made it
                            out alive. They talked for a while then Carl made his way to the LIRR
                            and took a train to Westbury to take his friend home, then he went to
                            his own home. Carl said when he got home; he took off his clothes, took
                            a shower and sat with his cat Buster till his wife came home. He had no
                            cable or info at home for a few days. He went back to work on Saturday
                            and started checking areas for damage. He went up to the roof where he
                            found personal belongings. He remembers that later he had to clean out
                            the cubicles of co-workers that had been killed so the items could be
                            returned to the family. This was very difficult. He developed sinusitis,
                            headaches, and watery eyes. This was a chronic condition. He remembers
                            Christine Todd Whitman saying the air quality was safe. Carl says this
                            was an act of war; a deliberate act of war; a personal attack on him. By
                            2005, he developed phobias and after 9/11 he was always on guard. He
                            then started having panic attacks and couldn’t concentrate. In 2007 he
                            went to VR therapy. This is where images are shown of the actual
                            traumatic events. Carl has a lot of repressed issues and has survivor’s
                            guilt. He has to wear earplugs outside because loud noises such as
                            planes bring on bad memories. He feels as a whole Americans were very
                            supportive. Lessons learned: anything can happen at any time; you do the
                            best you can. He says, “Learn from the past, try not to repeat the
                            mistakes.” When asked if he had any final comments to make, Carl said,
                            “I breathed and felt 3000 people that day; it’s in my DNA; it’s a part
                            of me now. It’s something you will never forget.”

       Stacey is a detective and 17-year veteran of Suffolk Police Department.
                            At the time of 9/11 she was a Suffolk County Patrol Officer and a
                            volunteer member of the Department of Health and Human Services. 9/11
                            was her day off from work. She was listening to her car radio when she
                            heard about the WTC attacks. Stacey was called in as a volunteer by the
                            Department of Health and Human Services, which operated under the
                            auspices of the federal government. She was put up at a hotel in
                            Manhattan and worked a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift at a makeshift morgue site
                            located by One World Financial Center. She worked mostly in the
                            logistics, security and in preliminary identifications assisting the
                            medical examiner. Her first visit to Ground Zero was on the night of
                            September 13th, 2001. Stacey recalls coming up through the Battery
                            Tunnel and seeing the site, which “looked like a movie set.” She
                            remembers that the federal government provided them with respirators and
                            others were charitable in donating hard hats and gloves. There were also
                            clergy of different faiths to provide support to rescue/recovery
                            workers. Stacey recalls the particular instance of a Red Cross volunteer
                            who slept on a cot, and maintained an orderly and well-stocked bathroom
                            for workers at the site. Stacey worked with the medical examiner in
                            makeshift morgue located in tents outside One World Financial Center.
                            Stacey states, “It’s a total bombardment of your senses.” She remembers
                            the three firefighters looking for their lost firefighter brother in the
                            morgue. She was there when the body was recovered, and assisted one of
                            the firefighters in draping the U.S. flag over his brothers’ body.
                            Stacey mentioned these particular instances of camaraderie and unity
                            moved her right after 9/11, and that there was greater respect for
                            police and authority after 9/11. Stacey worked at the site for about 23
                            days, and describes coming home and spending nearly 2 hours in the
                            shower trying to get the dust off. She was proud to serve and feels her
                            life has been a “blessing.” She feels that “People don’t get how lucky
                            they are to be here,” and that people should be, “grateful for this
                            country, grateful for the freedoms we have, and never take it for
                            granted.”

       James was working in fleet management for a rental company in 2001, and
                            was also a volunteer firefighter with the Manorville Fire Department.
                            His wife was an air traffic controller on 9/11. She called him up on the
                            morning of 9/11, and asked him to turn on the T.V. to see the attacks on
                            the towers. At around 5 a.m. on 9/12/2001, he was activated by his fire
                            department and was told they would be reporting to Ground Zero. Their
                            unit met up at the county firehouse in Yaphank. In his group, there were
                            8-10 firefighters, and they were given a full police escort into
                            Manhattan. James recalls there was not a lot of conversation on the
                            truck going in, and that they were mostly mentally preparing themselves
                            for what to expect at the site. James’ unit was staged on the FDR Drive,
                            along with 40-50 other firefighting units from Suffolk County. He
                            performed a multitude of support based jobs, which included providing
                            lighting for the site using the heavy equipment trucks. James vividly
                            describes the sight, and smells from the site and recollected a similar
                            experience when he responded to the TWA Flight 800 air crash. James
                            remembers the sense of hopelessness in the air, and felt this experience
                            was unlike any other he encountered as a firefighter, because of the
                            lack of control and the massive amount of wreckage at the site. James
                            felt this experience made a major change in his life. He was in the
                            corporate industry and didn’t have enough time for his family. After
                            2001, James purchased a winery and has more time for his kids and wife.
                            The experience made him realize “how short life can be,” and is glad he
                            has changed his lifestyle.

       Roy was working as the Chief of the Department for Suffolk County SPCA

                            when he got a phone call about the attacks on the twin towers. His
                            agency was equipped with a state-of-the-art mobile hospital that they
                            had recently received in August 2001. They contacted the NYPD to see if
                            they required SPCA expertise/machinery to help out with the search and
                            rescue dogs at Ground Zero. Their services were needed, and Roy arrived
                            with other members of the SPCA to Ground Zero at about 6 p.m. on
                            9-11-2001. The SPCA, Office of Emergency Management, FEMA, and NYPD
                            coordinated their efforts for search, rescue, and recovery by setting up
                            tents around Chambers and West Street. Roy coordinated the efforts of
                            the SPCA chapter by contacting veterinarians to administer to the
                            medical needs of search and rescue dogs. Roy and other members worked a
                            minimum of 12 hour shifts for nearly two months. He mentioned that they
                            were given respirators, but weren't shown how to use them and each
                            respirator came with only one filter. They were told the air quality was
                            “okay” even though it was not. Roy was responsible for making sure that
                            the dogs who searched the pile wore booties so their paws would not get
                            cut up with the sharp debris. He also ensured that the dogs periodically
                            had their eyes irrigated with water due to the heavy presence of dust
                            around the site, and that they were well hydrated and provided IV if
                            they so needed. Roy also mentioned that sometimes the dogs would get
                            depressed because they could not find anybody alive. Roy brought his own
                            golden retriever, Cody, to the site to serve as a therapy dog for the
                            rescue workers. Roy felt that the generosity and charity of the people
                            of NYC gave him strength to keep working at the site. Roy values his
                            life differently after 9/11. He felt that the people really pulled
                            together and that the courageous K-9s truly proved that they were “man’s
                            best friend.” Roy ended his story by showing clips of himself and his
                            dog at the pile, letters from school children in North Carolina thanking
                            the SPCA for its efforts, and a Dickin Medal he received for gallantry
                            with animals presented by the British Consulate General.

       Alan is a radiologist who practices in Long Beach, New York. On 9/11, he
                            was home and heard the news of the event on TV. It felt like “the end of
                            the world.” On CBS news, there was a call for doctors and nurses to
                            volunteer for rescue. He knew he had valuable skills and was compelled
                            to go to the city. He met with other volunteers at a park and ride. He
                            was driven to Lefrak City Police Headquarters where he was asked for
                            personal information and next of kin information. At that point, he
                            realized the severity of the situation. He travelled in a van to One
                            Police Plaza in NYC. He could see the debris all over the
                            Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and was worried and nervous. When Alan
                            arrived at One Police Plaza there was “organized chaos.” He was brought
                            to the Command Center in the building and assigned to Beekman Hospital
                            downtown. He walked to the hospital through the smoke and thick dust. He
                            could not see the street signs and just followed the bright lights.
                            Ambulances brought doctors to One Liberty Plaza and set up operating
                            rooms and respiratory therapy. There were no survivors to be treated--
                            just injured responders. He stayed all night and described it as “the
                            longest night he ever had.” He met many firemen and remembers helping
                            one load a cart with body bags, oxygen tanks, and other supplies. A
                            ConEd worker took his hat off and put it on Alan’s head and said, “Doc,
                            there is glass flying everywhere.” He finally returned to One Police
                            Plaza and was told the next day that there were no survivors. He was
                            driven back to Long Island by an a police officer from Floyd Bennett
                            Field and was told his services were no longer needed. Alan felt a sense
                            of pride since there weren’t many doctors that volunteered. He was
                            frustrated and angry that the nation was violated and felt obligated to
                            readjust his priorities after 9/11. Alan believes strongly in community
                            service and volunteered to go to Haiti for a week. He feels every
                            individual has an obligation to give back to their communities. Both
                            events taught him a good lesson. He described the worst part of 9/11 was
                            that there were no victims to treat. After the attacks, his two children
                            collected $800 by running a lemonade stand, and Alan matched every
                            dollar. After going to Haiti to help with the earthquake relief, he had
                            a feeling of accomplishment and said it was very gratifying. He was
                            amazed at the reactions of families of 9/11 victims: complete grief,
                            others had a sense of pride, and everything in between. Alan still sees
                            plenty of opportunity for terrorism. He believes another event is
                            inevitable. He is very disappointed in the US allies since the US
                            assumes the cost to protect the world. Alan believed the time right
                            after 9/11 was very special—a defining moment when the “US was one.”
                            Alan said there is no better feeling in the world than giving. However,
                            a few things bothered him after 9/11. That there was no thank you to
                            volunteers (although he said that is not why he went). He did receive a
                            thank you in 2006. Alan felt the heroes were the ones who were not paid
                            to be there. They were the people that were there because they felt the
                            need to help. He would do it again if needed. The police and firefighter
                            lawsuits make him angry and he thinks patriotism in the country has
                            faded. “People in this country focus on differences rather than
                            similarities.”

       Richard was working as a narcotics detective for the NYPD on 9-11-2001.
                            He was at home when his mother called him up and told him about a plane
                            hitting one of the Twin Towers. He watched a bit on T.V. and was also
                            listening to the police scanner. He reported to his precinct in Queens
                            to mobilize and prepare his team to go down to the site. The first day
                            they were posted by Pier 40 and mostly did crowd control. His team was
                            there for 19 hours. For the first three weeks, he worked at the site for
                            an average of 16 hours a day. Richard recalled that the site reminded
                            him of a war zone. During the first three weeks, his unit worked in the
                            bucket brigade, did perimeter security, and performed searches in
                            buildings adjacent to the site. Richard also worked at the landfill
                            through June 2002. He knew four people who were lost due to their rescue
                            efforts on 9-11, including a volunteer fire fighter named Brian Hickey.
                            He went to about 4 or 5 police/firefighter funerals, but generally tried
                            to stay away from attending too many of them. He was able to speak to
                            his parents who were particularly supportive when he relayed his
                            experiences of working at the site. He felt that most of his work at the
                            site was just about doing his job, as opposed to being a hero. After
                            9-11, Richard joined a new unit in the NYPD called the joint-terrorism
                            task force and worked with them for about eight years. He feels people
                            were a lot more patriotic right after the attacks and also treated the
                            police officers with more courtesy and respect. Richard particularly
                            commended the efforts of people who came on behalf of agencies from all
                            over the country. He feels the government is doing a lot better with
                            sharing information between agencies now than prior to 9/11. He feels it
                            is possible that an event like this can happen again, and that it is
                            important for people to be “really, really aware” of events that are
                            going on in this country and around the world.

       Gerry is a retired superintendent of schools for Levittown, Elmont, and
                            South Huntington School District. He has done work with the Suffolk
                            County Society for Prevention of cruelty to Animals (SPCA). Currently he
                            is working on a project for financial literacy. He lives on Long Island
                            with his wife and two stepchildren. On 9/11/2001 Gerry was driving into
                            the city via the Whitestone Bridge. His wife called his cell phone and
                            told him that a plane had hit the World Trade Center. He pulled over,
                            and saw the second plane hit the other tower. He knew it was a terror
                            attack and he decided to return home. He picked his stepson up from
                            school on the way. The Office of Emergency Management of New York City
                            was on his beeper to mobilize the provision of animal protection and K-9
                            rescue. Suffolk County had just given their SPCA a “MASH” unit bus out
                            fitted with all veterinary ambulance equipment. A call to his friend,
                            Roy, brought the unit to the city. The next morning there were four
                            stations set up at West Street, each one with a veterinarian and a
                            technician. Gerry noted the environment was very subdued, quiet and
                            eerie. No cell phones worked. There was ash all over and people were
                            running out of their shoes, just leaving them behind. As his team
                            arrived, Gerry was stunned at the scene of the collapsed towers. They
                            were greatly received by the workers there. Calm and relief prevailed as
                            the rescue dogs began their work. Their teams grew to ten vets and techs
                            and they added dogs to sniff out explosives. By evening the next day, no
                            survivors were found as the buildings were so badly demolished and the
                            dogs were tired. Pictures of families had been blown out of the windows
                            and were strewn out in the street. An assessment of needed supplies,
                            protocols and types of dogs was ongoing during the day. Vet Med
                            responded with dogs from all over the country. Dogs have a psychological
                            component and need to be retrained and rested upon exhaustion. The dogs
                            felt very sad when no one was found alive, so to keep them upbeat the
                            firemen would wrap themselves in blankets and hide in the pile. The dogs
                            would then feel happy when they found them alive. The level of
                            cooperation between all teams of responders was good. They worked hard
                            and felt helpful. They also documented the responses and protocols that
                            worked for any future incident. There was a certification problem with
                            veterinarians coming from other states. There was plenty of food in the
                            service areas. Pet supplies and dog food were plentiful. Because of the
                            hot metal on the pile, the dogs required booties. PETCO was a major
                            donor and General Electric donated two x-ray machines. A collective
                            depression set in as the days went by and the organized bedlam
                            continued. Gerry said that the government was lying about the toxicity
                            at the site. The dangers were just not realized. His handlers and team
                            were assigned to Stuyvesant High School and would come into the building
                            covered in soot and other contaminants. He decided to test the air there
                            and found it more toxic than out of doors. Then the respirators were
                            mandatory for his teams and exhaust systems were installed. The wind was
                            blowing west most of the time so his workers did not get as much bad
                            air. Gerry had recently been to Israel. He noted the population as a
                            whole was more diligent in recognizing potential danger. They had
                            protocols in place and were trained to know what to do. Our country
                            needs to learn this quickly. At the beginning Gerry’s wife was very
                            frightened. She worried constantly. He took her into the site after a
                            few days to show her it was calm and OK. One of the alarm whistles
                            sounded and she started running. When he sauntered up to her she relaxed
                            and started showing him her support for this project. There were mixed
                            motivations for people there. One was a sense of patriotism. Firemen
                            rushed in to help, knowing they were going to their death but went
                            anyway. The other angered him. There was theft of small things such as
                            dog food and medications. He was aggravated that the ASPCA advertised
                            and raised money and took the Suffolk county chapters’ credit. Gerry
                            worked forty 12 hour days. In his slow wind down he experienced weird
                            dreams, an emotional edge and some mental shock. He did what he did, and
                            did not consider himself a hero. In his ability to mentally
                            compartmentalize he was able to use the experience wisely. He has many
                            memories of people he met, of dogs he met. Some were real and some were
                            phony, the best and the worst in human nature. He definitely would
                            respond again and knows his team has great protocols in place to do so.
                            Gerry would like to see our government do the right thing. He feels that
                            we are in jeopardy because of our overbearing political correctness. It
                            endangers our population. Our country is not in great shape, but we need
                            to work toward world harmony.

       John was born in Brooklyn, NY. He was raised on Long Island by an Italian
                            family. He was employed as a NYC Corrections Officer – he worked in
                            arson investigations. He was assigned to Rikers Island between Queens
                            and Manhattan Island on the East River. He worked as a corrections
                            officer for 16 ½ years. He had been a volunteer firefighter before this
                            and was also a paid firefighter. On 9/11 he was at work. He was
                            listening to the radio when he heard about the towers – he was listening
                            to public and police radio. He went to his parking lot, and the last
                            thing he thought was that the buildings would collapse. He reported back
                            to his office and waited for instructions from his supervisors. He
                            loaded all the equipment to a staging area on Rikers in a convoy. He had
                            all tools ready for excavating. He arrived after the 2nd tower had
                            collapsed. The units were all pulling in. He went over by Building 1.
                            There was confusion at the scene. There were a lot of agencies trying to
                            coordinate. It became apparent that there were too many people. He was
                            in contact with OEM. It was just a bug pile of rubble smoldering.
                            Everything was pulverized. He was assigned to Search and Rescue Team,
                            and finally on day 2 they got paper masks. Working on the pile was
                            “tedious”. There were small pockets of fires and electrical wires. He
                            had firefighter friends and wondered if they were ok. He recalls the Red
                            Cross – people were lining the West Side Highway, some were throwing
                            cartons of cigarettes to them. There was a tremendous outpouring of
                            public support – they hadn’t seen anything of this magnitude. It started
                            to drag on since they found very few bodies. The main motivation was
                            that this was his job. It’s amazing how people fought. His parents were
                            very worried that he was there. His mother refused to get on a plane
                            after. He didn’t know anybody who died. After 9/11, he moved further
                            east and married his girlfriend. It is important to people not to get
                            too lax. He didn’t think people were capable of doing something and
                            succeeding, but that thought changed. Heroes were people who didn’t do
                            this as part of their duty. John said, “Innocent victims should not be
                            forgotten,” and, “It takes a disaster to show the generosity of New
                            York.”

       Robert is from a large family on Long Island and was a volunteer fireman
                            for the Huntington Fire Department on 9/11. He currently owns a tent
                            rental company. He was awakened by his father on the morning of the
                            attacks and went to the firehouse immediately. It was there he watched
                            the events unfold and the buildings collapse on TV. He wanted to go and
                            help-- he took his gear from the firehouse and went home and packed a
                            bag. He headed toward NYC on the LIE and parked at a friend’s who lived
                            in the city. He took a taxi to 74th Street and walked the rest of the
                            way to Ground Zero. He bought a camera on the way. A fire truck from
                            Queens picked him up and he signed into the command center. He arrived
                            at the site at 8:00 PM. Shoes were hanging from the trees near the
                            command post and it was smoky and very dusty. Robert worked on the
                            bucket brigade and described the pile as unstable and smoldering. The
                            smell intensified on the second day. It was eerie and hard to describe.
                            He didn’t realize what he was getting into but still felt the need to
                            help save lives. Robert is proud that he volunteered and said everyone
                            at the site worked as a team. He left the site in the mid afternoon of
                            9/12 and laid down to rest at a fire house nearby. Robert returned to
                            the pile and his hopes of finding any survivors diminished as time
                            passed. He never gave up hope that he could find someone alive and
                            worked with a camera deep in the holes of the pile. He yelled and banged
                            on pipes but there was no response. Robert was at Ground Zero for 72
                            hours straight. He “threw caution to the wind.” He could not contact his
                            family. He left the site in a step van. They proceeded down the West
                            Side Highway covered in dust and dirt. People lined up and applauded; it
                            was the most recognition he got for his efforts. He believes his
                            experience on 9/11 has made him a better person and knows “there is
                            always something you can do.” He felt his deceased brother watched over
                            him while at the site. He was happy to get home to see his family and
                            slept for 14-15 hours. His father was proud of him, and he was proud of
                            himself. When he returned to the Huntington Fire Department he was
                            suspended for ten days due to “misuse of district gear.” He was hurt by
                            the action taken against him. He was never called a hero and never given
                            any recognition for his work. He said all his fellow firefighters
                            received 9/11 pins except for him. A friend took his pin off and gave it
                            to Robert. Robert stayed in the Huntington Fire Department until last
                            year and has never returned to Ground Zero.

       Brian lived in Smithtown on 9/11 and was in the academy class of the
                            NYPD. On that day, he started class training at 7 AM on 20th Street
                            between 2nd and 3rd Avenues. He was in the class when he heard a plane
                            fly over the building. A lieutenant came in and said a plane had hit the
                            tower. A little while later, a sergeant came in to the class and said a
                            2nd plane had hit, and they told the recruits they would be mobilized.
                            Brian’s father worked for Customs at 6 WTC and his brother and uncle
                            were both policemen. He was worried about all of them. Groups of
                            recruits were taken out on buses near Ground Zero for triage, crowd and
                            traffic control. Brian directed traffic outside Bellevue on 1st Avenue
                            most of the day. He reached his mother by phone at 5:30 PM and found out
                            his family members were all okay. While on traffic duty, people and cars
                            were coming up 1st Avenue covered in dust. It was chaos. People did not
                            know where to turn and said they could not get out of Manhattan. Brian
                            had no answers to all the questions he was asked. He heard on a cab
                            radio that the towers collapsed. He tried to keep people and traffic
                            flowing, it was all he could do. People looked shocked and were covered
                            in dust and debris. It was surreal. Brian did traffic duty until 8:30
                            PM. On the days following 9/11, he worked 12-hours shifts from 4 AM to
                            4PM. On 9/12, Brian took an empty LIRR train from Deer Park with only a
                            few hours sleep. Manhattan was deserted—he could smell and see smoke.
                            Each night Brian got closer to the site; for weeks he could see smoke.
                            He did security around the site and brought people into surrounding
                            apartments to get their personal effects. There was dust and dirt all
                            over the apartments. No one knew how to react. Brian never worked on the
                            pile. No NYPD recruits were permitted. He was sad, angry, and
                            disappointed that the event happened. He took it personally that NYC was
                            hit. He still gets angry at times. Brian felt the removal of bodies was
                            done very respectfully. It gave him chills to think of the outpouring of
                            patriotism and support. Brian did know a few people (not personally) who
                            died in the attacks--a police officer from the NYPD video unit and a
                            police academy instructor’s wife. He attended both of their funerals.
                            There were children lined up along the Westside Highway singing the
                            national anthem. It was very emotional. Brian took it one day at a time.
                            Some cops broke down but had to hide it from the public. They all
                            sustained each other. His class was known as the “9/11” class and he was
                            proud to be a part of it. He was glad he was able to help and glad he
                            remained on the job. Some recruits left the academy after the attacks.
                            He feels the event changed him. He internalizes things more and gets
                            angry. He has become more spiritual. He is disappointed in the
                            government that the event happened. Brian is patriotic—he flies the US
                            flag every day and his father is a Vietnam vet. He thinks all responders
                            deserve special recognition and that some people have already forgotten.

       Jim lives in Nassau County on long Island and worked as a sergeant for
                            the NYPD. His office was on the Nassau County border with Queens. Jim
                            was in the narcotics division. On 9/11/2001 he was scheduled to work at
                            3:00pm, so he was busy loading sheet rock that morning. It was a
                            beautiful day with a blue sky that he later called his 9/11 sky. His
                            phone started ringing like crazy around the time that the first airplane
                            hit the World Trade Center tower. At first Jim thought it was an
                            accident. Jim got in his car and headed into Manhattan on the Long
                            Island Expressway. He said that anybody holding any kind of shield was
                            headed in and/or directing traffic and helping anyway that they could.
                            The moment that he saw fire and smoke, as he approached his office, the
                            disaster became very real to him. He could hear yells and screams in his
                            radio’s background. He started making a mental list of the supplies and
                            equipment he would need. He was not sure if he should “bring everything
                            or bring nothing”. Jim was supervisor to the detectives in his precinct
                            and known as the “helicopter mother” to the other guys in his division.
                            At the office he counted heads. Everyone was there waiting for orders.
                            Jim supervised “the cream of the crop”. His guys worked as a well-oiled
                            team “an unbroken circle”. They knew that there was no hierarchy today
                            and they just had to go and make orders up on the way. They were part of
                            a larger effort, would work as a team and watch each other’s back. Jim
                            and his colleagues rushed to get there. Roadblocks were everywhere. Both
                            towers had collapsed by now and the people were covered with dust and
                            smoke. “You could just taste it”. They bailed out of their jeep
                            somewhere around City Hall and started running to the site. One side of
                            the street was sunny, the other black. There was no thought of the
                            toxicity. Opportunities to help just started presenting themselves. His
                            men had to be accountable to him and check in every ten minutes. He was
                            den mother, had no answers, and there was chaos and disorder all over.
                            They went into the subway to help people trapped there. They then
                            started toward the pile. Jim said” you never saw metal the way it was
                            wrapped up down there”. It was hot. He saw a firefighter panicking “all
                            messed up and dragging a buddy’s coat by the sleeve”. Jim grabbed him by
                            force and took him to his men. Jim, himself, remembers panicking a few
                            times when he lost track of his guys. This firefighter, looking for his
                            buddy, was one. He knew that you can’t be afraid at the time; you waited
                            to throw up until later. Building 7 of the WTC was on fire. As an
                            engineer, Jim knew that it would collapse, so they started running from
                            it. Jim said that it “sighed before it came down”. He thought it was the
                            end of the world. Many rumors had started flying about another hit, but
                            they never thought about leaving. "Our job is to stay because someone
                            has to be here." This is not a job, but a career. Jim is second
                            generation Irish American with a strong work ethic. Humanity, at its
                            worst, calls the police to resolve problems. He had been in many tense
                            situations as part of his job and it was these moments that “hook you”.
                            Helping people hook you to the profession. This is my country, this is
                            my city. My whole family has lived and worked here in the police
                            department.

       Anthony “Tony” is a retired court officer, volunteer EMS member, and a
                            city councilman in Glen Cove, Long Island. On 9/11 he had the day off as
                            he was assisting Tom Suozzi in the primaries. The town of Glen Cove had
                            a deal with a local ferry boat company to transport people back and
                            forth from Glen Cove to Manhattan in times of emergency. He joined a
                            group of EMS personnel as a volunteer to go down to assist anyone in
                            Manhattan using the ferry boat services. When they arrived in lower
                            Manhattan he and his response team treated many of the walk and wounded.
                            There were many people caught in the blast from the collapse. That night
                            he came home, he changed his clothes in the garage as his wife would not
                            let him in the house with the dust-covered clothes he had on. He still
                            has some of these clothes in that condition in his car. He returned to
                            the site for a couple of days through mid-September and worked on the
                            “pile” as part of the Bucket Brigade. There was no time to feel tired,
                            but when he arrived at home he was “ready to collapse.” Anthony
                            mentioned some clear memories from the few days he worked on the pile.
                            He remembers taking body fragments and bagging them into a red bag, and
                            accidentally standing on a piece of person. Anthony is also a Vietnam
                            veteran and his memories of the war are compounded by the memories he
                            has working on the pile. On the pile, Anthony was given a respirator on
                            the first day, and was provided a filter the second day. He recalled
                            there was a Salvation Army setup nearby that was distributing these
                            items. He also remembers generous responses of people who distributed
                            iced tea from stands. He remembers also going into a five and dime store
                            one day wearing his court officer uniform and a pin from serving down at
                            the WTC site. The store owner came up to him and said he could take
                            whatever he needed for the site for free. Anthony believes that as
                            Americans we should be “careful and vigilant” to prevent such attacks
                            from happening again.

       Alex was 16 and a senior at the Bronx High School of Science on
                            9/11/2001. He remembers it was a beautiful day, “absolutely stunning”
                            and he wore sandals that day as he took the train from his home in
                            Queens to the Bronx, where his school was. When Alex was in English
                            class, a PA announcement was made about the plane attack on the towers.
                            Alex remembers his first reaction was, “So what?” He thought the plane
                            was very small, probably a two-seater and that it was an accident. Soon,
                            the principals dismissed the students. Alex mentioned that several of
                            the students’ parents were possibly working in the Financial District.
                            As a senior, he was asked to escort some of the freshmen home. He
                            remembers that there were several rumors going around school about the
                            attacks. Alex took the 7 train home to Queens. From the train he could
                            see the Twin Towers burning. On the subway, everybody was quiet and it
                            was “eerie.” When Alex arrived home, his parents were there. They were
                            supposed to work in the city that day as well. Alex knew something had
                            changed, but he did not know how that change would impact him. He
                            remembers on there was no other programming on tv except coverage of the
                            Twin Tower attacks. Alex wanted to help and did not feel it was right
                            for him to be sitting at home doing nothing. He took the train to the
                            Salvation Army HQ at 14th and 6th streets in Manhattan to ask if they
                            needed help. He did not tell his parents where he was going or what he
                            was planning to do. Alex managed to obtain a fake volunteer badge and
                            got onto the Salvation Army truck, which went past heavy security check
                            points around the WTC site. He recalls that there was “tons of paper”
                            strewn on the ground and things were covered in dust. The roads in the
                            area were “choked up” with rescue vehicles. Alex and other volunteers
                            distributed bottled water to police and firefighters who were “so
                            grateful.” Alex described his actions as an “urge to do something” and
                            that he was more at peace down at the site than at home. Alex continued
                            to work closely with 3 college students on the pile. He described dogs
                            searching on the pile and fires burning beneath the rubble, and the
                            danger of adjacent buildings falling. The first day, Alex was there for
                            14 hours. Then a fresh crew from the Salvation Army took over. Alex
                            felt, “I had a responsibility to New York to be there.” Alex was there
                            for about 10 days and was part of the recovery process. He remembers
                            that it became more and more like work. He remembers receiving a lot of
                            support from his family and particularly his girlfriend at the time who
                            was just fifteen. Alex states, “For the first time in my life, I saw
                            life for what it was, fragile and bare,” and stated, “It made me an
                            adult.” Alex also worked as a caseworker in December of 2001 for the
                            Salvation Army. He distributed money to families of victims of the WTC
                            disaster. He talked about some instances in which people were trying to
                            scam the Salvation Army of some of this money by pretending to be family
                            members of victims, and thought this was very sad. Alex feels if
                            anything 9/11 was a uniting event…it united people of all ages and
                            colors.

       John owns a network of animal hospitals in Queens/LI. He got inspired to
                            be a vet by a cousin. He has lived in other areas of the country, and
                            had been in NY for 10 years on 9/11/2001. He remembers Howard Stern on
                            the radio at home talking about the plane attacks and turned on the TV.
                            He lives in Valley Stream – roughly 13-14 miles from the city. He
                            arrived at the site 5 or 6 AM on 9/12/2001 after contacting members of
                            the Suffolk SPCA looking for vets to help with the dogs. He loaded up on
                            supplies and parked by Stuyvesant high school. He knew the dogs would be
                            working overtime in the first 96 hours. He recalls a lot of ash and dust
                            as he walked through the pile. He remembers pictures and paper floating
                            down. He realized they needed to find water sources, food sources –
                            there were a lot of challenges, but Suffolk SPCA had a lot of
                            credentials. The challenges were who to bring in (vets). There are
                            cadaver dogs, search and rescue dogs – each with its own
                            handler/trainer. The dog search was high anxiety. There is a very close
                            relationship between dogs and their handlers. Another challenge was
                            washing the dogs and having to do so without hot water. They improvised
                            by using a fire hydrant hose to create a reservoir of water. Most of the
                            problems were in the first 72-90 hours. The dogs would fall into
                            crevices or “fingers” on the pile. He took care of some of the minor
                            injuries sustained by the bucket brigade, and provided dogs with fluids
                            and antibiotics. He recalled one man in particular who had driven all
                            the way from CA to help. John and his colleagues had more freedom
                            because they were private units. He remembers seeing the bucket brigade
                            working, and watching Building 2 come down. After the first night, he
                            showered 7 times, to get the smell out. John says he would respond again
                            if it were local. O.E.M. coordinated with them, and now shelters are
                            equipped with animal rooms. He says, "Everybody in every department did
                            pull together,” and that, “Dogs were not put in any situation that the
                            handler wasn’t."

       Felix has lived in Myrtle Beach for the past 5-1/2 years with his wife of
                            7 years and their 2 daughters, Madison (6) and Cameron (4). He works as
                            a police officer in Horry, a town in Myrtle Beach. He also teaches.
                            Felix was an NYPD officer from 1999-2003, then he worked for the federal
                            government from 2003-2006 in Washington. He moved to Myrtle Beach in
                            2006. He stated that his decision to leave New York had nothing to do
                            with 9/11, he just had an opportunity. Felix was 29 years old when 9/11
                            happened, and had only been an officer for 2 years. That day he was
                            assigned to voting booths in Rockaway, Queens. As soon as the first
                            plane hit, he and others were notified that they would be boarding a bus
                            that would take them into the city. He didn’t know what to expect or
                            what the plan was, he just knew he had to go. A bus came and took him to
                            Greenpoint. He stayed at the precinct for the first few days; he said it
                            was very stressful and scary. There was no phone contact, which made
                            things even worse. On the morning of 9/12, he went back on the bus and
                            headed into the area where he was assigned to secure the area and help
                            people in the area. Upon arrival at the site, it looked like a bomb hit
                            Manhattan...something you see in the movies. Shattered buildings, plane
                            debris, buildings were down...it was scary. Felix worked 15-16 hour days
                            for the first few weeks. It was a long process and there was always a
                            lack of sleep. Felix said he did what he had to do. Every day was a
                            different assignment but mostly he was assigned to barricade where he
                            had to keep people out, or sometimes he had to transport people around.
                            He was never on the bucket brigade. He was able to take breaks, and
                            would sleep on a cot somewhere or on a pew in a church. The Hilton hotel
                            had some recliners and food was available. Vendors brought food to
                            responders and everyone pulled together as Americans. He was exhausted
                            most of the time, but keeping people safe was first and foremost
                            priority. This was his duty. After the first few weeks, he was on 12
                            hour shifts. He didn’t go home until 2 or 3 days after his initial
                            arrival. His family members had been very concerned, but they couldn’t
                            reach him. Felix wasn’t married at the time and he lived alone. One of
                            his memories of 9/11 was the sound of the alarms. When a building was
                            about to fall, someone would yell, “Run, run!” and everyone would start
                            running. The one time this happened, Felix thought he was going to die.
                            He thought to himself, "I’m only 29, I’m not married and I haven’t had
                            kids yet." He was glad he survived. Another memory is one of people
                            holding pictures of loved ones. They would just walk around holding
                            pictures asking if anyone had seen the person. Looking at their faces
                            was the hardest part. But that is what gave him and others the strength
                            to go on. They had to find survivors or at least help people get
                            closure. It never got easier and he said anyone that was there, will
                            never forget…you will carry this for the rest of your life. Felix went
                            to many funerals but he remembers one in particular. His law professor’s
                            wife was killed on 9/11. They had a 3 year old daughter at that time.
                            She was given a medal in honor of her mother. It was like losing a
                            family member for Felix. He remembers his law professor telling him,
                            “Make sure you go home the same way you got to work.” That didn’t happen
                            to many on 9/11. Two months later Felix was called to the Queens Harbor
                            when Flight 587 went down. He doesn’t feel like a hero; he took an oath
                            to protect others and that’s what he tried to do. His retiring sergeant
                            told him that a hero is a sandwich...remember that. Felix doesn’t feel
                            he changed very much since 9/11; maybe he became a better officer. He
                            would do it all again in a heartbeat. His final words to us were,
                            “Remember the history of 9/11, (and) stand guard. We’re not going to let
                            anyone harm us, not here, not anywhere”.

       Sean is an NYPD officer. On September 11th he was on the 10:00 to 4:00
                            detail for Election Day at Pratt University to open up the polls for
                            primaries. He remembers it was a hot day and that he was only in charge
                            of two machines. He had his own vehicle that day since he was only there
                            to monitor the election, and did not have his police radio on him. He
                            realized what was going on when a Pratt officer was hysterical and
                            screaming. There were many elderly people at the polls and he remembers
                            speaking to an elderly woman who told him about “a freaky accident.” He
                            never thought the building would come down. Then he realized the
                            Pentagon had been hit as well. The kids were dismissed from their
                            classes, and he was just staying there to keep people calm. Terraces
                            filled up with people watching in fear. Sean switched back and forth
                            from the city-wide radio to the regular radio. There was “chaos” on the
                            radio. He tried to call the precinct but the lines busy. He finally got
                            a 10-2 (call to report) after the second tower collapsed. He knew it was
                            coming down when the kids were screaming. He felt helpless, despondent.
                            The thumping of the bodies stuck with him. He was told this was his
                            post; he was on patrol the rest of the day but he wanted to go to Ground
                            Zero. There was an accident on the Brooklyn Bridge but he couldn’t get
                            to it because of everyone pooling out of the city. The city was shut
                            down. At eight o’clock that night he reported back to his precinct. All
                            off-duty officers were told to go to their command, and he got dismissed
                            after 12:00 a.m. Sean was assigned to security detail and used to get
                            home late, working 16 hour days. His ex-wife temporarily moved into the
                            house, which improved their relationship. For a brief time Sean mentions
                            that “the cops were liked” in the city. Sean talked about terrorism; he
                            said the problem is “here” now--(in the U.S. now) and we need to deal
                            with it. While working at Ground Zero, Sean pulled out six firemen,
                            three of whom were only ashes. He also pulled out nine people that were
                            dismembered. Sean spoke warmly of his now-grown son’s service in the
                            Navy and his son’s reflection on the attacks ten years later in a letter
                            he wrote to his father.

       Robert lives in Bellport; he is married with one child. He recalls that
                            on 9/11 he was an active NYPD detective in Queens at the 107th precinct.
                            He was working the polls for the precinct. He was called by a security
                            guard to go up on the roof where they had a clear view of the city
                            skyline. The second plane hit the tower as he watched. He called his
                            wife who was an accountant for the school district via cellphone to tell
                            her he loved her and he was going to the city. His sergeant organized
                            small groups to head into the city. In the polling place it was absolute
                            chaos. They were worried for themselves and worried about other police
                            officers. Robert describes it as “organized chaos” and having to put his
                            “game face on” to go in. Robert describes how the officers tried to cope
                            by laughing a lot and trying to make light of the situation because they
                            have a job to do. They organized themselves at an undisclosed location.
                            In the van there was dead silence. It took them down the LIE, through
                            the tunnel, and down the Westside highway. They were all supposed to
                            meet on West and Broadway. There were people lined up on the Westside
                            Highway cheering them. For the first time in a long time, Robert says,
                            “I felt it to be life altering.” Describing the bucket brigade, Robert
                            says, “There was no time for the emotional aspect,” when being a cop,
                            but that, “You’re looking at it almost like it’s a theme park.” He
                            worked 15-16 hours at the pile and remembers that Outback Steakhouse
                            delivered food to them. He described how the buildings around the WTC
                            site were guarded by lasers to see if they were swaying. The fire would
                            blare from under the pit. He describes heat and dust on the pile, saying
                            it was kind of “like a movie set.” At night, he stopped at a downtown
                            7-11 although he was covered in dust. When he went home, his wife also
                            put her game face on. Then he would go back to the site to do recovery
                            work. Robert spoke in detail about the scenes in the landfill, the
                            skeletons and hair that he found. The responders told jokes to feel
                            better. He felt responsible to provide body parts so that families could
                            have some closure. If the pile was like a movie set, the landfill was
                            more like a grim reality. All the hype went away at the landfill, which
                            had the smell of death. A sheet made by two little girls which said,
                            “Thank You!” was one of the things that helped sustain him. It made
                            Robert feel like he was helping, and this kept him going. Robert
                            de-stressed at the bar; he says the loss of his friends Joe Viggian and
                            Billy Holfester (who passed away from cancer) “eats away at you”. When
                            Hillary Clinton came to the landfill they wore protective Tyvek suits.
                            Robert says he is a bit disillusioned with the political game - the
                            responders did not have protective equipment all the time. Now he has
                            re-prioritized his life. It doesn’t matter anymore that he has to pay
                            bills, cut the lawn, it all seems insignificant. “I just don’t want the
                            government to forget about the little people like me.” He also said, "In
                            50-100 years a free society is the only society we should have.”

       On 9/11/2001, Tracy worked as a surgical technician in the operating room
                            of a New Jersey hospital. On that day they heard breaking news about the
                            plane crashing into the WTC tower over the radio in the operating
                            theater. Initially, Tracy remembers that most people thought this was an
                            accident—perhaps a small plane that mistakenly hit the tower. Later,
                            they heard about the second plane attack and saw the towers fall on
                            television. Tracy described that people in the operating room felt
                            shocked and scared. Eventually, the managers at the hospital mobilized
                            their operating room staff and equipment in order to accommodate the
                            possible influx of patients from the attack. At this time, Tracy was
                            single and lived on Staten Island. On 9/11, she could not get back to
                            Staten Island because the bridges were closed, so she ended up staying
                            with a friend in New Jersey. When she later arrived home on Staten
                            Island, she remembers the smell of burnt electrical wiring drafting from
                            the WTC site in southern Manhattan. She also recalled driving to work
                            and seeing the hubbub of activity at the Staten Island landfill, which
                            served as a host for the remains of the fallen towers. She also lost a
                            high school friend, Monica, who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald. Tracy
                            observed that right after 9/11, people were much kinder to each other
                            and expressed a greater feeling of unity and patriotism. Tracy met her
                            future husband, Robert, at a family barbecue in June 2002. Robert was a
                            transit police officer who had worked in District 3 in Coney Island
                            since 1993. Tracy remembers asking Robert about his experiences at the
                            WTC site as she was very curious to know about it. Robert told her about
                            working on the pile and with the Bucket Brigade. At the time, he had
                            frequent urinary tract infections and Tracy urged him to join the WTC
                            Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program at Mt. Sinai Hospital in
                            Manhattan. Robert was later diagnosed with GERD, sinusitis, and other
                            health ailments from his exposure to toxins at the WTC site. Tracy and
                            Robert had a son, Bobby, in 2005. When they later went on vacation to
                            Florida, Robert complained of a sudden sharp back pain. They thought
                            nothing of it, and resumed their normal routines upon returning home.
                            Then, one day, Robert called her from her work to say that he just spit
                            up blood. They went immediately to get an X-Ray and then a CAT scan.
                            Tracy recalls the exact day when her life changed—January 17, 2007.
                            Robert was diagnosed with Stage 4 renal cell carcinoma, a very rare type
                            of kidney cancer. Robert was eventually scheduled for an operation at
                            Columbia Presbyterian for a four hour surgery to remove the tumor on his
                            kidney, which they later found out weighed almost four pounds. Tracy
                            mentioned that his job and coworkers were very supportive while Robert
                            was on medical leave for his recovery from the surgery. This was a very
                            stressful time for Tracy and her family. There was much shock and anger
                            over the fact that this condition may have been caused by Robert’s
                            exposure to toxins at the WTC site. Robert continued to reflect on his
                            post 9/11 work experiences at the site. He recollected his experiences
                            of working at the WTC site using clogged and ill-fitting respirators. In
                            the meantime, Tracy continued her new work as an insurance adjuster.
                            There were mortgage bills and other household expenses to be paid.
                            Robert received disability payments from the police force, and Tracy had
                            to work to cover the rest of the expenses. However, she was glad for the
                            busy work-- she did not have time to think about how she felt about all
                            the life-changing events she was going through. At this time, she was
                            also pregnant with her second child, Abigail. Robert’s cancer spread and
                            he soon became addicted to the painkillers he was prescribed by the
                            doctors. He also began to prepare for his passing by making sure his
                            family was financially taken care of through his job. In the meantime,
                            Tracy continued to work, visit him in the hospital, and hoped that he
                            would get better. She needed him to stay strong and healthy for his
                            family. On May 12th, 2002, Robert passed away at St. Catherine’s
                            Hospital. Tracy said “his body gave out.” Tracy’s daughter was only a
                            month old when her father passed away. At the end, Robert went from a
                            healthy 43-year old man weighing 193 pounds, to losing nearly 40 pounds
                            due to the cancer that had spread to his bones, brain, and even his
                            mouth. In the last days, Tracy recalled that Robert loved to play Texas
                            Hold Em’ with his friends—which he would often win. Tracy now gets her
                            strength from three very close friends, and her two children. She
                            remembers that Robert told her to “move on” if he should pass away.
                            Tracy wants people to know that 9/11 has affected a number of families.
                            She experiences moments of loneliness, anger, and depression but tries
                            to keep busy with her kids. She spoke a little bit of the estrangement
                            she now feels from Robert’s family. Tracy also spoke about the Zadroga
                            Bill and does not understand why this bill does not cover cancer [at the
                            time of this interview]. Tracy ended her interview by saying, “I always
                            try to look at the positive things in life---you have to move on---and
                            make the best of everyday.”

       Raymond has been a police detective for 22.5 years. He was working
                            narcotics at Brooklyn North and on September 11th he had a training for
                            law enforcement officers in the tristate area at Brooklyn Army Terminal.
                            He was driving on the Belt Parkway when he heard about the plane
                            attacks. They all watched the events on the news together, and saw the
                            towers fall. Raymond decided to leave the training to try and help. He
                            went to a police supply store to purchase police jackets and supplies he
                            thought he would need. From there he went to the site with a few
                            colleagues. They arrived about 11:00 am and found “complete
                            pandemonium.” They had borrowed a couple of shovels and were by 7 WTC
                            when they heard a strange sound: the building “turned very gently” and
                            windows popped out of their frames as the building came down. Raymond
                            was very scared, and remembers hiding behind parked cars to get away
                            from the collapse. While Raymond was shoveling, he came across a hand
                            with red nail polish, quite intact, and “beautiful.” The hand had a
                            Claddagh ring on her finger with the heart pointing inward, suggesting
                            she was married. Ray was very much moved by this memory. What drove him
                            to go to the site, more of a “compulsion”, was he felt he wasn’t doing
                            his part on the Brooklyn side – everyone thought there would be
                            survivors in the rubble. Raymond doesn’t even remember eating that day.
                            He lay down, fell asleep, and woke up with debris all over him “like a
                            glazed donut.” He worked until dusk and later stayed at a police
                            precinct overnight. Raymond’s wife was pregnant with their second son at
                            this time. It was difficult when he worked at the site. People came with
                            photos of loved ones, asking if they could find anyone. This was the
                            biggest disappointment - that they couldn’t find anyone alive. He felt
                            no joy or satisfaction at the work, but he would do it again. He lost a
                            police officer friend and went to 15 or 20 funerals. Ten years later he
                            didn’t realize the stuff he had been breathing was dangerous, but was
                            warned by a friend who works construction. He “wore breathing equipment
                            that did not work – three different types” and then literally did not
                            wear anything. Raymond expressed hope that the hard lessons learned from
                            the breakdown in procedures and communication will be remembered, and
                            hopes that FEMA remembers the heroism and gallantry of the first
                            responders who were “doing more than the average man, putting yourself
                            on the line.”

       Ray recalls being at a dental appointment on the morning of 9/11. While
                            his teeth were being cleaned, he saw the second plane hit the tower on
                            TV. He realized it was no accident and told the dentist he had to leave.
                            Ray was a retired fireman. He was a lieutenant in special operations and
                            was FEMA trained in fires, scuba diving and all special tactics. He was
                            still active in the Marine Corps. Ray had retired one month prior to
                            9/11 due to knee surgery. He did not want to retire. He quickly headed
                            home to get his gear and called some friends along the way. He had a
                            boat at his home in Massapequa and once there, he started loading it up.
                            He took tools, a rifle and some other supplies. His daughter was 16 and
                            asked him why he was going since he was retired. He said he had to go.
                            He headed out and noticed that the boat was low on gas. He was a little
                            annoyed at his son who had used the boat last and didn’t fill it up. As
                            it turned out, the extra stop to get gas may have saved his life. He
                            raced through Reynolds Channel in E. Rockaway because it was a faster
                            route and he knew the waterways. He could see the billowing smoke from
                            the trade centers. His daughter called to tell him that the buildings
                            were collapsing; she was crying. He told her that it would be ok. He had
                            no experience with building collapses and couldn’t understand how this
                            happened. He continued on going under the Verrazano Bridge. There was a
                            lot of smoke and he thought that was probably from the 2nd building.
                            When asked what pushed him on, he said “This is what I was trained for”,
                            he was in the Marine Corps, coast guard and fire department. This is
                            what he does. His family had many firemen and policemen. He got to the
                            marina by the WTC, there was smoke everywhere. He didn’t know what he
                            would do he just wanted to try to find the command post. He saw a friend
                            on a fire boat and helped them stretch the line to get more water
                            through the lines. He left there and looked for the command post again
                            and asked for Chief Downey. He was told he was gone…that he was in the
                            collapse with the others. These were people he used to work with and
                            they were all gone. He saw some friends and they went into the Pfister
                            Hotel. He found a mask and a search rope and maneuvered his way into the
                            hotel with some others. People were digging everywhere. Tommy, a friend,
                            was there. Someone else with a dog was there. The dog found a boot and
                            attached to the boot was the Chief. They called for a body bag, saluted
                            him and moved on. This is happened in the first 1-1/2 hrs. The Assistant
                            Commissioner was found as well as many other Chiefs…people that Ray knew
                            very well. Ray was then sent into a void, lowered into a small hole to
                            look for survivors. He saw a young girl, no legs, just part of a body,
                            stuck on a piece of rebar. He had to take her off. They called for
                            another body bag. The soles of the sneakers he was wearing burned up so
                            he got some boots from someone. He had no mask until 3-4 days later. The
                            2nd day he got a FEMA radio. He ran into his brother and they stayed
                            together for a while and then decided that it would be better if they
                            split up just in case something happened they didn’t want to both be
                            killed. He already felt guilty that the person that replaced him had
                            been killed. He was a great guy. He didn’t find anyone alive. He said
                            the ironworkers were great at moving the large pieces and the carpenters
                            were also great. He felt guilty that the fire and policemen received so
                            much credit when there so many others doing such a great job. The first
                            night he slept on a yacht in the marina. His boat was filled with debris
                            and the yacht was more appealing. It also had running water. He stayed 4
                            straight days and then on Saturday he took his boat home. He found out
                            that all the people in his old company had perished in the building
                            collapse. They were up on the 50th floor when the building collapsed. At
                            times his nose would bleed and his throat would close up. A constant
                            electrical smell was in the air. EMS worked retrieving bodies and
                            everyone did as much as they could. Ray got involved with a FEMA team.
                            He would mark cars that had bodies in them and then they would go back
                            later to retrieve them. At one point he fell and broke a tooth and also
                            got a piece of steel in his eye. He went to see a doctor and then
                            continued on. The third day cranes came in to expose stairways so they
                            were able to go back in to search. He worked for 1 day on and 1 day off
                            for 3 months, never finding anyone alive. He wanted to give some
                            families a sense of closure, something to bury. He went to many
                            funerals. When not working, he attended funerals and ended up escorting
                            families to and from funerals. He didn’t see his own family for months
                            and he never had time to grieve. Some families would ask him what
                            happened and he would always tell them the truth. He told them the same
                            thing that he would want people to tell his family if he had perished.
                            He answered all their questions. Ray recalls riding home on that 4th day
                            on this boat. He was alone on the boat, debris everywhere that had been
                            scattered by the wind. He enjoyed the peace for a moment and thoughts of
                            his friends, co-workers, families would creep back in and he would drive
                            faster. He didn’t want to think about it. He kept in touch with his
                            family while at the Ground Zero and contacted others as well. He let
                            people use his phone because it was one of the only ones that worked. He
                            didn’t see his brother after that first day but he was ok. His own son
                            was around 13 at the time and Ray felt guilty that he was able to spend
                            much time with him because he was with other grieving families. His wife
                            kept all the newspaper clippings for him. He didn’t talk to his family
                            much about what was going on and he realized later that his family was
                            suffering as well. Some guys were better at working on the pile but Ray
                            wasn’t interested in recovering bodies, he wanted to find people alive
                            so after a month, he lost interest and that’s when he began to help the
                            other families. Ray kept in touch with many other families. Some of his
                            friends that perished had been to his home 6 weeks earlier for his
                            retirement party. He felt a strong obligation to help anyone he could.
                            One year after 9/11 Ray was divorced. He thinks it might have something
                            to do with 9/11. His father passed away shortly after that and they had
                            a close relationship. He didn’t realize that his dad was getting so sick
                            and he wasn’t there for him as much as he should have been. Ray feels
                            very guilty about that. Sometimes Ray gets angry with those that ran
                            from the burning buildings while others ran into them. He is remarried
                            now and happy although his health isn’t that great. He is colder now,
                            more direct and to the point. Thanksgiving brings bad memories. One
                            Thanksgiving he was taking the turkey out of the oven and it reminded
                            him of the young girl he took off the rebar. It hurts him that he can’t
                            be a firefighter anymore and sometimes now, it hurts him that no one
                            calls him to ask how he’s feeling, after helping so many others.

       Dennis was born in Brooklyn and moved to Plainview, Long Island when he
                            was in junior high. His father passed away when he was 18 months old so
                            he was raised by his mother; there were no other siblings. His mother
                            remarried later in life. Dennis received a master’s degree in mechanical
                            engineering, and in 1973 he got a job working for the city as the Chief
                            Information Officer, Human Resources Administration, New York City
                            (HRA). Dennis commuted to work every day, taking the 7:06am train from
                            Hicksville until he retired in late 2002. On the morning of 9/11, Dennis
                            was already hard at work when the attacks happened. He was on the phone
                            with a colleague when he heard of the 1st plane attack. His office is
                            about 2 minutes from the site. He looked out the window just in time to
                            see the 2nd plane attack. He knew it was no accident. Shortly after that
                            he received a call from the Mayor’s office. 7 World Trade Center was the
                            first building to go down. This building housed the communication center
                            for all of New York. This was part of the reason there was so much
                            chaos. This building housed the LAN (Local Area Network) system that
                            controlled all the services for the entire city. Dennis and his company
                            were contacted to set up a new command center for communications. Pier
                            92 was designated as the site. Within 24 hours, the cruise ship pier was
                            completely renovated and set up with over 300 PCs, 400 telephones and
                            whatever else was needed for a new central command post. Many vendors
                            volunteered supplies, parts, and time to assist in this huge endeavor.
                            Parts were trucked overnight from out-of-state to assist in the new
                            building site as the Office of Emergency Management. This included
                            clothing and food for the workers. One local restaurant sent 200 dinners
                            the first night, and Krispy Kreme sent hundreds of donuts every day for
                            weeks. By 6am on the morning of Sept. 13, the bunker site was up and
                            running. Dennis felt extremely proud that when the computers were turned
                            on, the HRA logo was in the center of the screen. He spent the first few
                            nights sleeping at the Pier and after that he worked 16 hour days. Pier
                            92, the new Office of Emergency Management, was now the place where
                            people could go to get information on their loved ones. They could bring
                            items for DNA testing. A computer system with digital photos was created
                            overnight by 1 employee, which became the new source to search for
                            missing persons. Dennis worked for 4 months straight, continually
                            assisting with moving phones or computers or new programs as they were
                            needed and as they were revised or updated. This office also housed the
                            Family Assistance Program for WTC victims and their families. If you
                            needed free legal assistance, food stamps, or housing, that's where you
                            could go. One company in Oklahoma donated 10,000 stuffed animals for the
                            children when they came to the center. Thousands of origami doves were
                            donated from Japan. Thousands of homemade cookies were donated from
                            Ohio, and had attached notes and letters thanking responders for their
                            hard work. Dennis felt honored and proud that he was able to do this and
                            he said that his employees never complained or had excuses. He made a
                            note of saying that he had some civil servants that worked for him and
                            they did an outstanding job. Everyone did their job, did what they could
                            and then some. Dennis feels that the police and firemen that ran up into
                            the buildings were heroes; everyone else was just doing their jobs. At
                            some point later in time, the Pier 92 OEM office was dismantled and a
                            new site was set up at an undisclosed location. His memories are of the
                            generosity of others and the work ethic of his crew. He remembers seeing
                            athletes assisting and Susan Sarandon was helping as well. He is
                            appalled that there are people out there that hate Americans so much
                            that they would do this. It was a dark time but he was glad he was there
                            to help.

       On the morning of 9/11, Mark kept thinking what a beautiful day it was,
                            such a blue sky. He had only been on the NYPD police force for 1 year
                            and usually worked the night shift but had a court appearance and had
                            had to change his work schedule. He went to the 7th precinct that
                            morning and remembers seeing people gathering and phones began ringing
                            off the hook. The TV was on and everyone was watching as they were
                            putting on riot gear. He was told to suit up as well and was loaded into
                            a van with 12-13 others. He called his parents from the van because he
                            didn’t know how serious this was going to get. Once they arrived at
                            Ground Zero, there was chaos everywhere. One building was hollowed out;
                            papers were flying everywhere. He looked up and saw a knapsack falling
                            from one of the building. As it got closer, he realized it was a person
                            and he was alive. He was dressed as a construction worker and he was
                            trying to gain momentum, trying to balance himself. He fell right in
                            front of Mark, exploded onto the ground. Mark saw at least 20 others
                            falling, he could see the look of death on their faces. These people
                            knew they were going to die. He had such a helpless feeling. As people
                            fell, Mark said “God Loves You” or “Jesus Loves You”. A chief came by
                            and told Mark that he was needed to do a rescue inside a building. He
                            and others questioned this. People were falling from the building and he
                            was being asked to go into it. The building started crumbling from top
                            to bottom. If he and his co-workers had gone into the building when
                            asked to, they would have all perished. Someone else fell and
                            disintegrated into a cloud of smoke half way down. There was chaos and
                            people running everywhere. Fire trucks were flying around like Tonka
                            toys. Mark felt that God spoke to him and told him not to go into the
                            building. He feels his life was spared. Mark recalls seeing someone hit
                            the ground 10 feet in front of him. Another person looked like they were
                            trying to land on an awning. He did but his head detached and flew
                            across the street. Mark could see their faces as they were falling. Mark
                            worked at Ground Zero for approximately 10 months, 4 days a week. He
                            worked on the bucket brigade for a night and then he was assigned to
                            maintain the perimeter to safeguard the area. He remembers the stench
                            and the smell of death and decay. He had trouble sleeping and developed
                            rashes on his body. He had bad dreams, became paranoid and had panic
                            attacks. Before 9/11, Mark had been serving in Iraq. He had a job in
                            logistics and intelligence, a job that was very important. He was also a
                            volunteer firefighter. He felt it was his duty to serve and he was
                            honored to do it. He wanted to make a difference. He has a family now
                            and teaches his kids values and to contribute to society--- to make a
                            difference.

       Diane worked on the 69th floor of the Port Authority Building. She
                            arrived at work at approximately 8:30 am and went to the café to get
                            coffee. Everything happened very quickly. All of a sudden she thought
                            there was an earthquake and people started running. She felt suffocated
                            but ran with her co-workers down the stairs. When she got to the
                            mezzanine, she was in water up to her knees. She made her way outside
                            and someone yelled, “Don’t look out the window!” Of course, everyone
                            looked and there, hanging over the window frame, was a bloodied body.
                            Someone directed them to the elevator that went to the street. "Run as
                            fast as you can," was what she and her friend Cathy heard. They ended up
                            in front of the Millennium Hotel. They heard people screaming and a
                            building started to fall. She was outside, people were screaming and
                            running and all of a sudden, Diane was knocked down. She lay in the
                            street and people ran over her. Five people stepped on her...she
                            fractured her ribs. This ended up not being so terrible because in the
                            seconds that followed, someone fell on top of her. It was a body and she
                            knew the person was dead. She couldn’t move; she thought she would die
                            right there. She got hit in the head with something and black smoke
                            started to surround her. She was choking and getting claustrophobic. She
                            tried to get the body off her but she couldn’t. That body was actually
                            saving Diane’s life because as the building was collapsing, it was
                            sending debris everywhere. That debris was hitting the man on top of
                            her. She tried again to move him off of her and managed to wiggle out
                            from under him. She became fixated on finding her purse, she was in
                            shock. The surrounding area was like the Twilight Zone, fire trucks were
                            everywhere. Smoke and ash filled the air. Two police officers, Richie
                            Vitale and Carol Paulkner, found her and helped her. There is a photo of
                            them leading her out of the area--Diane is in the middle, completely
                            covered in ash. It is one of the many famous photos that was printed in
                            Newsday. Her eyes were burning and she was still in shock. Another
                            person said she would take Diane home to New Jersey and she remembers
                            that they stopped at Lincoln Center to use the ladies room to wash out
                            their eyes out. Diane remembers seeing a sign that said “NYC Closed”…she
                            will never forget that. Diane remembers co-workers trying to help a
                            wheelchair bound person out of the building. Many didn’t make it out.
                            She remembers firefighters and police officers rushing up the stairs as
                            others were trying to get down them. She lost some of her friends; her
                            faith gave her solace. To this day Diane feels guilty that she couldn’t
                            help the person on top of her because it was he who saved her life. To
                            this day she keeps in touch with a psychologist that had been very
                            helpful to her in getting through the ordeal. She also remembers seeing
                            all the debris falling from the upper floors of the building only to
                            find out later that the debris was people. It took her 7 hair washings
                            to get the smoke and debris out of her hair. Debris was embedded under
                            her fingernails and was inside her pantyhose. She found out later that
                            after she had gone across the Tappan Zee Bridge, the building she worked
                            in had collapsed. On every 9/11 anniversary she thinks of the man on top
                            of her and wonders who he was and at the same time, grateful that he
                            saved her life. On every 9/11 Diane replays the events that happened
                            that day in her head. She’ll never forget the building falling…it was
                            her home, it was her place.

       Cathy was born and raised in the Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn in a
                            mostly Irish, Polish and Italian neighborhood. As an adult she moved
                            just three blocks from where she lived as a child, and raised her two
                            sons in Brooklyn as well. By 2001, Cathy had worked in the World Trade
                            Center for 28 years. She loved working at the WTC, she loved the
                            vibrancy and pace of the business district. She used to commute to the
                            city by subway or express bus daily. On 9-11-2001, she was working as a
                            financial county supervisor for the Port Authority on the 69th floor of
                            One World Trade Center. She worked from 8-4 every weekday, but usually
                            got to work a little bit earlier to settle in and chat with her
                            coworkers. On that morning, she decided to go to St. Peter’s Church
                            later to light a candle, because for some reason she was feeling a bit
                            uneasy. She was talking to some of her coworkers, when she suddenly felt
                            the building shake. She did not know what was going on, and later she
                            found out that a plane had hit the building. She thought it was a small
                            plane that accidentally crashed into the building. Cathy had previously
                            survived the first bombing of the WTC in 1993. She knew that she had to
                            evacuate the building immediately in case of such an emergency. She took
                            the stairs down with other coworkers, and recalls that the stairs were
                            packed with people and that it was very dark. As they went down, the
                            lights went out; by the time they came to the 40th floor they could
                            smell the overpowering smell of gasoline from the plane. Cathy tried to
                            keep people lighthearted with her sense of humor. As she walked down,
                            Cathy saw young firefighters climbing up the stairs with heavy
                            equipment—she didn’t know if they survived. When she reached the
                            mezzanine floor, she saw that some of the water pipes had broken, and
                            they had to wade through knee deep water to go to the entrance of the
                            building. She also clearly remembers seeing bodies of people on the
                            street –those that jumped from the top floors of the tower because of
                            the incredible heat and fire. She saw the second WTC tower on fire and
                            spoke with a firefighter who told her that these were terrorist attacks
                            by two large planes. Cathy walked away from the WTC, as she was a few
                            blocks away, the first tower came down. By the time she walked through
                            Chinatown to the Manhattan Bridge, the second tower had come down. She
                            was still with one co-worker and they saw a church after crossing the
                            bridge. The pastor was giving out food and water to people who were
                            escaping from the city. She had walked several miles, and recalled
                            feeling grateful that she was still wearing her sneakers from her
                            commute to work that morning. Cathy finally found a payphone --as there
                            was no cell phone coverage for miles--and called up her husband to let
                            him know she was safe. She got home at around 4:30 that afternoon. Cathy
                            remembers that there was much unity and patriotism displayed months
                            after the attacks. She lost some coworkers in the operations department
                            and a neighbor’s son who was working at Cantor Fitzgerald. She also knew
                            9 people in her parish who died on 9-11. The neighborhood came together;
                            they had candlelight vigils for those who died that day, and they grew
                            closer because of their common loss. The WTC attacks have left an
                            indelible impression on Cathy. As the yearly anniversary of September
                            11, 2001 approaches, she reports that she has nightmares about the plane
                            attacks. She also reports feeling some survivors’ guilt over her
                            fortunate escape, and wonders about people in the towers who did not
                            survive that fateful day.

       John was raised by his mother in a six story building in the Bronx. John
                            had retired from the FDNY in 1999. He responded on 9/11 as a volunteer
                            for the FDNY. He wanted to do this interview to keep the memory alive:
                            “This was America’s second Pearl Harbor." On 9/11, he was having body
                            work done on his car. He was watching TV at the car shop and saw the
                            attacks live. He was stunned. He wondered how many people would die.
                            Once at home, he saw the second plane hit. He called his fire house in
                            the Bronx. John says, "It was a situation of disbelief.” He had
                            previously retired due to a back injury, but still wanted to help out.
                            He believes this kind of reaction is in you, or it’s not. He had his
                            helmet and bunker gear at home, and his wife pulled it out of the closet
                            and prepared it for him. He loaded up the car, went to the firehouse in
                            the South Bronx, Hunterspoint. John was on the 111 truck. He describes
                            the firehouse as very active. It is affiliated with a nearby church, and
                            the firehouse participated in Christmas dinners, Easter ceremonies,
                            baseball games, and senior citizen activities. John described the WTC as
                            the Grand Canyon. It was so mind-boggling that he had to stop to take it
                            in. He needed time to digest it. He felt very helpless and small in the
                            face of the whole situation. He still remembers the smell of diesel fuel
                            and wet, hot, concrete. There was a white powder everywhere. Still, John
                            hoped to find people. His shoes were melting because of the heat. He
                            feels that it was the grace of God that kept the pile from moving.
                            People got some burns from the generators. They were wearing paper masks
                            but they were useless because of the sweat. Later, John was diagnosed
                            with polyps in his larynx. But he would still do it again. John knew
                            people from other firehouses who had been lost. The neighborhood had a
                            whole memorial of candles at the firehouse for weeks. There was a great
                            unity in the city a lot of compassion for each other. “It’s a shame it
                            couldn’t prevail." “It should be memorialized; you can’t let it go” cops
                            are cousins. He decided to become a fireman after high school got right
                            into construction. John is an avid church goer. John now gets treatment
                            at the WTC Health Program.

       Bob is 52 years old. He was born in Queens, and is married to Diane, with
                            two daughters, named Stephanie and Brittany. He was an executive vice
                            president at a coffee distribution company. He traveled a lot. Now he
                            doesn’t due to WTC related illnesses: COPD, RADS. Now he spends most of
                            his time at home with his family. He doesn’t like what has happened to
                            his health, he has been declared totally disabled by several doctors.
                            Bob speaks about 9/11 experiences at schools such as in New Mexico and
                            Maine. He wants to recount his tale for posterity for his grandkids and
                            future generations. Bob had been in the coffee business for over 30
                            years. He loves to cook all kinds of food and would like to have a
                            cooking show. In his career, he started delivering coffee to different
                            vendors and through the years he moved up the ranks to become the
                            executive vice president. He is the type of person that likes to help
                            people. On 9/11, he was taking a shower when his wife told him what was
                            happening. He talked to a friend on the phone who was in Florida, who
                            said, “The New York landscape will never be the same. “He thought of his
                            kids in Catholic school, and thought that he had to help. He grabbed a
                            bag with some extra clothes and hugged his wife, filled up on gas, and
                            went to a King Kullen grocery store and loaded up with water bottles
                            donated by the store. He met two doctors who also had supplies, and
                            ended up being escorted on the LIE by emergency vehicles. Bob had
                            several disposable cameras in his bag from the previous Saturday, when
                            he was at the US open. As they entered the Midtown Tunnel, they
                            documented their journey. As they entered the area, the second tower
                            collapsed, making it look like they were in a snowstorm. They were near
                            Pace University when Bob parked his car. He was wearing his friend’s FBI
                            cap and a military jacket. He kept running up and down the street with
                            water bottles, distributing them. He took photos of shoes in the trees.
                            Papers everywhere, he went through a cornucopia of beliefs. Bob called
                            his wife on a cell phone to say he was ok. In the pit, he helped a
                            fireman, Vince, who was trying to find his friends and co-firemen. Bob
                            took a bunch of pictures, one of a rag doll. Bob was in the pit for
                            quite a while. He heard a horrendous screeching noise. The heat was
                            unbearable; thank God he was wearing good shoes. He was in the pit when
                            Building 7 collapsed. There was a triage at a local Starbucks. They got
                            treated with some saline solution to wash out their eyes. Bob felt you
                            had to have common sense to survive this. He was there for the first
                            four days working intensely, helping out the other first responders. The
                            first night, he stayed at the number 10 firehouse. Bob helped take
                            fireman John McLoughlin out of the pile. He also took a decapitated
                            woman out of the debris. Afterward, he experienced phobia about flying,
                            so he got some professional help, which was the best thing he did. He
                            feels anybody who experiences a trauma should talk about it. Bob says he
                            has become more appreciative and enjoys every sunrise. He tries to be a
                            better person after receiving a diagnosis of PTSD. He talks about his
                            experiences with kids at school. He appreciates his family and friends
                            more. He is appreciative of the medical services he receives at the WTC
                            Health Program, and the way people treat him here. Bob went home after
                            4-5 days at the site, attended a candlelight vigil, and he was featured
                            on the cover of the community newspaper. He feels people on the east
                            coast understand what he went through, as do the people In Oklahoma
                            (where he was treated with honor as a first responder). He was very
                            moved by the Oklahoma City bombing memorial. Bob is thankful for the
                            people he has encountered after 9/11. He has a host of health problems:
                            spots on his lungs, COPD, RADS, PTSD, side effects from the medications,
                            such as massive nose bleeds. Bob experiences chronic sinus infections,
                            has the WTC Cough, night sweats, RADS. He is worried about his kids'
                            reactions. He would serve again, and hasn't lost faith in the
                            government. He is appreciative of the charity and advocacy for WTC
                            responders. His 9/11 volunteer work has affected his family as well; he
                            is not as active or healthy as he used to be. Final words: “Take the
                            good out of this” and help other people. Don’t think about yourself,
                            think about others.

       Frank recalls a clear, sunny day on the morning of 9/11. A police
                            officer, he had worked the night before on his regular shift and made an
                            arrest at 8:30 pm. On the morning of 9/11, he was heading to the East
                            side to file his arrest paperwork. During that time he began to hear of
                            the plane hitting a tower. He drove across the 59th Street Bridge and
                            saw smoke. When he got to his precinct, he was told to gear up and stand
                            by. The second plane hit and he didn’t realize it was terrorism until
                            much later. He felt unprepared for this type of situation. He headed
                            down 2nd Avenue with his partner and the adrenaline was flowing. Many
                            other emergency vehicles headed down 2nd Avenue also. Frank remembers
                            that even civilians were directing traffic so that the ER vehicles could
                            make their way through. He feels that this moment was the beginning of
                            the unification of people. He headed towards Park Row with a few other
                            units and just then the first tower fell. He was swallowed in a cloud of
                            smoke, trapped and helpless. His car was completely engulfed in debris
                            and powder; he couldn’t see anything and didn’t know what was happening.
                            He felt like he was swallowed alive and said that this is when he began
                            to get claustrophobic. To this day, he remains extremely claustrophobic
                            and cannot go into an MRI machine. He waited a few minutes for the smoke
                            to clear so he could drive further and regroup. There was 4-5 inches of
                            debris on his car and he had to wipe the car down with his hands so he
                            could get the windshield clear. He could hear people screaming and
                            crying, and he had to contain a man that came running up that wanted to
                            enter the building because his wife worked inside. Frank had to refuse
                            him entry and stop the man from entering. His called his supervisor and
                            was told to contain the perimeter. He could hear noises and was now
                            worried that another building would collapse. He had heard over the
                            radio that the Pentagon was hit and now knew that this was an act of
                            terrorism. He helped a few people get out of the building and then
                            headed towards Vesey Street. It was like a Twilight Zone movie; it
                            looked like the end of the world. He looked up and saw smoke and dust
                            and thought to himself, “This is how it ends”. He began to think of his
                            wife and daughter but knew he just had to stay in survival mode. He
                            thanks his blessings that he was spared that day. At some point he found
                            a deli that was open and was able to call his wife to let her know he
                            was ok. She had been working on 2nd Avenue and was scared but safe. Over
                            the first 3 days, Frank worked 58 hours. He mostly worked on securing
                            the perimeter and then he worked as an escort for families. He would
                            drive them to the Port Authority so they could identify their loved
                            ones. He would also have to drive people to the morgue. People would ask
                            him questions and he answered as best as he could. There was no rhyme or
                            reason why some people lived and some did not. After the first 28 hours
                            of working, Frank went home to see his family and rest for a few hours.
                            His daughter was only 9 years old at the time. Frank recalls that on
                            every 9/11 anniversary he was part of the circle ceremony. This was
                            extremely difficult and he said this is where you could see grown men
                            crying. It was very intense and after a few years, Frank couldn’t do it
                            anymore. It was too difficult. After that, every year he would watch the
                            ceremony on T.V. He watched because it reminded him that he was alive
                            when it could have easily been a different outcome. It wasn’t his time
                            to die and he feels very lucky. Frank said that he did what he had to
                            do. That as a 1st responder, it was his job to protect the people and
                            assist them in any way he could. He hopes that this would never happen
                            again but if it did, he would do the same thing. He also recalls that
                            his co-workers forgave any issues that they had between each other.
                            Nothing else mattered after that, just forgive, forget and move on with
                            your life. Frank worked in the area until April of 2002 and did various
                            things such as bringing people to the family center. There he would see
                            many people in constant need of many services that were being offered.
                            His group of 125 select NYC sheriffs, held down the fort. Frank felt
                            that sometimes the sheriffs didn’t get enough credit for what they did
                            or were not recognized as being a part of the rescue effort. They had
                            responded just as the police, firemen, and many other first responders
                            did and yet they were barely ever mentioned. At one point at a ceremony,
                            Frank got to meet President Bush and shook his hand. He was thanked by
                            the President and said that this meant a great deal to him. He feels
                            that the leaders at the time acted appropriately and that the community
                            was supportive. He also feels that the responders were not treated as
                            they should have been with regard to medical benefits. He doesn’t feel
                            that they should have had to go to Washington to fight for what they
                            believe they should have had. They should have received benefits without
                            asking for it. These benefits should have been provided as a service to
                            those that responded to a crisis situation. It was a slap in the face to
                            have to go and fight for what they believed should have been given to
                            them without question. Frank’s final words: “Life is short, forget the
                            pettiness and enjoy life. Make the best of what you have.

       Terrence “Terry” was a Port Authority Police Officer in the Emergency
                            Services Unit on 9/11/2001. He is now retired from the force after
                            serving 22 years. He is married and lives on Long Island. The Port
                            Authority Police is a bi-state organization that has jurisdiction over
                            the Hudson River crossing, airports in NYC area, and any crossings
                            between New York and New Jersey. As a part of the Emergency Services
                            Unit, Terry would handle anything above the scope of a regular patrol
                            officer-particularly any operations involving hazardous materials or
                            spills. The Port Authority Emergency Services Unit is a small command
                            unit of 30-40 people. A typical day on the job with the Port Authority
                            ESU involved checking and maintaining equipment, and waiting for
                            calls—mostly involving chemical spills. On 9/11/2001, Terry had just
                            finished working the midnight shift at his post in JFK airport. He was
                            at home drinking coffee, when a friend called and asked him if he was
                            doing well. He did not know what his friend was talking about, and then
                            he was told about the first plane attack on the WTC tower. Terry turned
                            on the T.V. to see the first tower on fire. Terry’s father, who was a
                            retired police officer, was at home with him during this time. Terry
                            immediately called up work and asked what the next course of action
                            would be. When the sergeant who picked up the phone told him they did
                            not have any orders from command yet, he was very surprised. When the
                            second plane hit the tower, Terry took his father to his brother’s
                            house, and drove on the Southern State Expressway to his precinct by JFK
                            airport. The Southern State was empty and Terry said, “It felt like a
                            movie.” He stayed overnight at the precinct—no one had gone to the site
                            because there were too many reports of officers who were missing or
                            presumed dead. Terry’s fellow police officers were experiencing a “range
                            of emotions.” People were in shock and they did not have a lot of
                            information about the situation, which was a major problem. Terry went
                            to the pile a few days after 9/11 and worked the night shift. He had
                            never seen anything on that scale. He worked on the bucket brigade, and
                            felt “it was a complete waste of time.” Basically, the bucket brigade
                            was a long line of responders who handed debris in a bucket from one
                            person to another. Terry wondered where the debris ended up a times, and
                            how they would ever get through the pile. They worked 12 hour shifts, 7
                            days a week. Terry worked on and off for approximately 8 months through
                            mid-2002. On the pile, they found a lot of money, merchandise and human
                            remains. When they found human remains they called this area
                            “productive” and would request the machine workers to dig in that area.
                            They worked primarily on the smells that certain areas emitted to find
                            bodies or body parts. Terry found a hand with a ring on its finger on
                            the top of a mountain of debris. He worked on the pile, in crevices and
                            wore a respirator because they dealt with all sorts of gases that
                            emanated from the rubble. Terry also emotionally recalls the time he
                            recognized a fellow officer’s body. This officer had his gun belt around
                            his ankles. He could not officially identify his body, because there was
                            a strict protocol to be followed when identifying bodies or body parts.
                            He and his partner made sure the police officer’s body was properly
                            covered before calling in other people to assist with the body removal.
                            Terry eventually felt “burnt out” from all the time he spent working on
                            the pile. His wife noticed major changes in him and wanted him to see a
                            counselor. He valued her opinion but was afraid at the same time that if
                            he saw anyone professionally, then he would be told to stop working.
                            Terry went to several police officers’ funerals-sometimes two funerals
                            in a day-but he became so burnt out that his wife advised him not to
                            attend any more funerals. Terry shared some of his experiences at Ground
                            Zero with his wife, but now regrets sharing them. There were days where
                            he did not want to work or deal with the debris. He described how
                            conflicted a fellow Chinese-American police officer felt about handling
                            body parts and bagging bodies. Terry often went to St. Paul’s chapel
                            near the WTC site, to get some peace and rest. He is also a history
                            buff, and liked to spend time there during his breaks because St. Paul’s
                            chapel was so historically significant. Terry also bonded with many of
                            the people he worked with at the site. He has become more spiritual
                            since 9/11. He regrets not being more assertive in working with various
                            people on the site and navigating the politics of working with different
                            organizations at the pile. He noted that it was humbling to see the
                            outpouring of support and charity he witnessed after 9/11.

       On 9/11/2001, Marty was working in the NYC DDC (Department of Design and
                            Construction) office headquarters in Long Island City, Queens. He
                            typically got to work at 8 a.m. His work involved traveling to buildings
                            in all five boroughs of the city, and he became familiar with all the
                            different neighborhoods. He was at work when the first plane hit, and
                            saw smoke coming out from the first tower from his office. He had gone
                            to get his camera to take some pictures when he heard gasps from other
                            onlookers as a second plane crashed into the second tower. He knew they
                            were under attack. He was in shock as they watched the buildings
                            collapse and turned to the guy next to him and said, “I think we just
                            saw 5,000 people just die.” The subways were shut down, but the Long
                            Island Railroad was running—but with several delays. He was on his way
                            home on the LIRR and was at the Hunterspoint Station. When he got home,
                            he watched the events of the day unfold on television with his wife and
                            was stunned. The next day, 9/12, he went back to work. The NYC DDC
                            executive deputy commissioner started making calls to get the DDC
                            involved in the rescue and recovery process. The heavy machinery
                            company, Caterpillar, was brought in to get heavy machinery equipment to
                            start cleaning up the site. A small group of staff members from the NYC
                            DDC went over to the WTC site on 9/13 for a preliminary inspection of
                            what services the city would need from the DDC. Marty was with this
                            group and took several pictures of the wreckage at the site. Marty felt
                            very strongly that he should volunteer at the site, and that this was
                            his patriotic duty. On Friday, 9/14, Marty went down to the Jacob Javits
                            Center to commandeer the lobby and to help organize people who were
                            working at the site into different trades and positions. He helped
                            create a “badging system” to organize the different trades. He also saw
                            the hospital ship “Hope” dock near the Javits Center to help with the
                            rescue efforts at Ground Zero. That was also the day that President Bush
                            came to visit the site for the first time since the attack. By Sunday,
                            things were more organized. Marty worked at the site for the first time
                            on the afternoon shift, from 4 p.m. to 12 p.m. Then he switched with a
                            co-worker to the “graveyard shift,” 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. Marty drove every
                            night to Long Island City, and then took a shuttle bus along with the
                            rest of his shift crew. As responders to the WTC disaster, their shuttle
                            bus received a full police escort to the site. Their crew was debriefed
                            for about an hour by the previous shift managers. Marty and his crew
                            worked at Sector 4 by the Plaza Turner building, which included WTC
                            buildings 5, 6, and 7. Marty describes that there was a “sense of
                            urgency in their mission,” and they were “desperate to find people
                            alive.” Marty recalls that first night at the site was “eerie.” They
                            were housed at an elementary school opposite Stuyvesant High School of
                            Science. Marty’s job was to solve problems, and organize things. The DDC
                            hired other construction management companies, who hired contractors—who
                            in turn hired the construction workers. The DDC was in charge of
                            managing the construction management companies and paid their salary.
                            They also brought in structural engineers to inspect areas underneath
                            Vesey Street because “safety was a big responsibility.” Part of Marty’s
                            job was to inspect building foundations, especially that of Building 7.
                            The pile was “2,000 degrees hot” in some areas, and they were pulling
                            out white hot rebar. There were FBI personnel were on site to view any
                            “interesting” materials that came out of the pile. In one instance, they
                            found a safe that was difficult to open, and there was a lot of loose
                            ammunition, guns, and missiles that were confiscated by the FBI. Marty
                            relayed a story of a very skilled machine operator who was very tired
                            after working a long number of hours, and had some difficulty with
                            picking up a large beam from the pile. Everyone was tired, but they gave
                            everything they could, because they knew it meant a lot to the whole
                            country. While working on the pile, Marty remembers the horror of seeing
                            a piece of a victim’s body stuck to one of the beams. Marty also recalls
                            how the steel oozed out of the pile like lava. He brought in one of
                            these lava rocks that were formed out of the intense heat, pressure, and
                            fusion of steel and other materials on the pile. Marty is very
                            appreciative of the firemen. He felt the police officers were just
                            “yahoos,” and did not follow the safety instructions at the pile. He
                            mentioned that the National Guard did a great job as well—they mainly
                            guarded the perimeter around the pile. Marty wore a respirator while
                            working on the pile. In spite of this, he still inhaled bits and pieces
                            of glass into his lungs. Marty later developed esophageal cancer, and
                            went through chemotherapy. He is now feeling better and is cancer-free.
                            He remembers that they were working in an intensely smoke filled
                            environment. One night there was no wind, and the smoke was so terrible
                            that it “engulfed them like snow.” He remembers that people and groups
                            were very charitable to responders and volunteers who worked at the
                            site. Once, a well-dressed woman in high heels came with her bodyguard
                            to the site, without a respirator, and served all of them hot chocolate.
                            In another instance, the Salvation Army set up a table spread of cookies
                            and drinks. On another night, celebrities such as Alanis Morissette and
                            Sigourney Weaver treated the responders to dinner. Marty felt these
                            “lovely little moments” made them believe in the urgency of their
                            mission. Marty did not want to leave the site; nobody wanted to
                            leave—there was a feeling of unity at the time. Marty worked as a
                            volunteer through mid-November 2001 at the site. Marty also remembers
                            that people came from different parts of the country to help out. One
                            family-run heavy machinery company called M.C.M. from Detroit, Michigan
                            traveled in a sort of “caravan” to the site about a week after 9/11;
                            with some of the biggest pieces of machinery Marty had ever seen. They
                            were “very patriotic people” and Marty reaffirms that everyone who
                            worked there was “selfless” in their actions. They were all initially on
                            a “rescue mission,” and were disappointed every day that they did not
                            find anybody alive. They did find the remains of a firefighter, who was
                            identified by his jacket. Marty observed the solemn ritual of carrying
                            the firefighter’s body out of the pile. The full effects of their work
                            at the pile did not hit the responders till much later. Marty recalled
                            how a heavy machinery operator reacted when he witnessed a head roll
                            down from the top of one of the piles. The machine operator later broke
                            down and cried. Marty encountered some symptoms of PTSD about three
                            years later when he went for the honor guard ceremony down at the site.
                            He saw the family members of the WTC victims at the ceremony, and the
                            entire scope of this disaster came back to him. After volunteering at
                            the site, Marty became involved with the FealGood Foundation and
                            traveled with them to Washington D.C., to advocate for the Zadroga Bill.
                            Marty thanked his wife, Dorothy, for her tremendous support during this
                            whole time. Marty has a very supportive family that originally hails
                            from Sicily. He feels that the site that they worked on is “sacred,” and
                            that his experience as a WTC volunteer was a very spiritual one. His
                            final words to his audience are, “There is room for everybody, when
                            there is a need.”

       On 9/11, Michael was a Senior Port Captain and Director of Operations for
                            New York Waterway. He transported passengers via ferry from Hoboken to
                            lower Manhattan. New York Waterway operated 12 different runs from New
                            Jersey into lower Manhattan. They operated from ports in Weehawken,
                            Hoboken, Colgate, Port Liberty, and South Jersey. As a Senior Port
                            Captain, Michael oversaw 21 boats in his fleet and was in charge of
                            vessel deployment. Their typical workday started at 4:30 a.m. They
                            transported people from New Jersey to lower Manhattan; many of their
                            customers worked in the World Financial Center. They were just wrapping
                            up one of their rush-hour trips into Manhattan on the World Financial
                            Center boat, when, at 8:47 a.m. one of the deck hands informed Captain
                            Michael that a plane had hit the World Trade Center. Captain Michael
                            went into “evacuation mode,” because he suspected the PATH train system
                            would be delayed, and their ridership would triple. They were in lower
                            Manhattan and for the first 15 minutes, everything was organized. Then,
                            the injured victims started coming in—many were burnt, with their
                            clothes melted into their skin, “walking around like zombies.” Some
                            people jumped into the water because of their burns. Captain Michael
                            switched over from the World Financial Center boat to the Frank Sinatra.
                            He oversaw the loading process, gave instructions to captains of other
                            boats in the fleet, and directed them on where to go to pick up
                            passengers. He had two mechanics on board who served as deckhands. When
                            the people started filing in from the towers, many were burnt and
                            bleeding. Captain Michael set up a first aid station on the boat, and
                            called in to Colgate and Newport via VHF radio to set up triage centers
                            there as well. The boat worked a triangular route from lower Manhattan
                            to Colgate and to Newport. The burn victims were transported to Colgate
                            and the bleeding victims were transported to Newport. Captain Michael
                            upped the boat load from 500 people per boat to 700 people per
                            boat—which was maximum capacity. The other passengers on the boat were
                            “incredible,” many helped out when people needed first aid treatment on
                            the boat. During this time, Captain Michael was frustrated because he
                            was not able to reach upper management for instructions, and much of the
                            responsibility fell on his shoulders. He fell back to his training he
                            had gained from Operation Sail 2000, when there were several fleets of
                            ships on the harbor. As the towers came down, he thought they were going
                            to tip over into the harbor, and ordered the boats to scale back to
                            mid-river. The dust cloud that emanated was so intense that “You
                            couldn’t even see your hand in front of your face.” Captain Michael did
                            not have time to be scared; he just did his job. At 9:15, Captain
                            Michael stopped all service from New Jersey into New York, because he
                            did not want passengers or reporters coming into the lower Manhattan
                            area. He was busy communicating with the captains of the other 20 boats
                            to tell them where to go to pick up passengers. There was moment in this
                            hectic time, when he just shut down for 3 minutes; he regrets that
                            moment because he could have helped out more. On 9/11/2001, the New York
                            Waterway transported roughly 500,000 people from New York to New Jersey
                            within a span of 9 to 12 hours. It was the largest marine evacuation
                            they had ever conducted. On that day, the NY Waterway also collaborated
                            with other fleets to set up various evacuation routes from New York to
                            New Jersey. They also set up a decontamination pit in Hoboken for
                            passengers coming in from the city. Captain Michael felt that his whole
                            crew just “stepped up” in this crisis. He particularly remembers certain
                            groups of passengers he transported: a group of children from the
                            daycare center at the World Financial Center, and 350-400 firefighters
                            from midtown to the World Financial Center. He wonders now how the
                            children who lost their parents fared, and if the firefighters got out
                            from the WTC towers alive. That night, Captain Michael got home at 11
                            p.m. His son, James was very relieved to see him. The next day Captain
                            Michael received a call from a Major in the New York National Guard. He
                            needed NY Waterway’s assistance in transporting National Guard personnel
                            into the WTC site. He remembers firefighters coming to the New Jersey
                            ports from all over the tri-state area to help out at Ground Zero. NY
                            Waterway also teamed up with Spirit Cruises—Captain Michael remembers
                            that the cruise ship “Spirit of New York,” generously set up a cafeteria
                            on board to provide meals to WTC responders. After 9/11, Captain Michael
                            worked a nearly 18 hour workday, 7 days a week, for the next 12 months.
                            They transported roughly 200-300 families who had lost their loved ones
                            in the towers to the site. On the ferries, they had grief counselors for
                            the families on board, although, no grief counseling was available for
                            the staff on board. Captain Michael only took time off for a week that
                            year, when he got pneumonia, in late December 2001 and early January
                            2002. Captain Michael has vivid memories of the disaster to this day—he
                            particularly remembers seeing a guy wearing a white shirt and black
                            pants with the clothing that had melted into his skin. He cannot
                            remember how he got the strength to do what he did. It has been ten
                            years, and he has been in and out of therapy to deal with the memories
                            from 9/11. His 9/11 and post 9/11 experiences also impacted his family.
                            He was working long hours after 9/11 and did not have time for his wife
                            or his two sons. He lost his first marriage, and in 2004 he was
                            diagnosed with end stage liver disease. He is now remarried, and is
                            involved with the FealGood Foundation to advocate for WTC responders who
                            have cancer from their work at the WTC site. Captain Michael wishes that
                            more people in NYC and the country knew what NY Waterways did on
                            9-11-2001, and how extensively the maritime staff worked on that day and
                            the days after.

       Linda works as a Lieutenant Captain for the U.S. Postal Police. On 9/11,
                            she reported to work at 7:30 a.m. She was a little tired from attending
                            a Yankee game on the previous night. She reported to the U.S. Postal
                            Service Division Headquarters at the James A. Farley building across
                            Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. They had just finished roll call,
                            when an officer monitoring radio communications heard some news from a
                            sergeant posted at their satellite facility in downtown Manhattan, on 90
                            Church Street, near the World Trade Center. The sergeant was stating
                            that a plane had struck one of the WTC towers. Linda ran to inform her
                            supervisor, Colonel Minnelli. The colonel, Linda, and another employee
                            named Officer Simmons headed out to assist with the evacuation of U.S.
                            Postal Service employee at 90 Church Street. Their main goal was to
                            ensure the safety of postal service officers, and secure the post office
                            building at 90 Church Street. In the car, they were discussing how best
                            to evacuate the post office building. The traffic down by the Holland
                            Tunnel was at a “crawl pace.”While they were driving down, another plane
                            had struck the second tower. At that point, Linda glanced at Captain
                            Minnelli, and they knew they were under attack. Linda vividly recalls
                            the sight of the burning towers as they turned into the WTC area, saying
                            that it was like a tv program. As they got closer to the site, the
                            traffic was so slow that Captain Minnelli ordered Officer Simmons to
                            drive the car—he and Linda would walk down to the post office building
                            on 90 Church Street. As they were running towards the building, crowds
                            were running away from the area. The only thing Linda was thinking about
                            was her job, which was to protect the other postal service employees and
                            secure the post office building site. As she was running, she recalled
                            seeing someone’s breakfast scattered on the street along with a shoe.
                            She thought about how frightened that person must have been – so
                            frightened that s/he dropped their breakfast, left behind their shoe,
                            and just ran away. They entered the post office building on 90 Church
                            Street. Most employees had evacuated and Linda and Captain Minnelli
                            stationed themselves by the building. There were police officers around
                            them in full riot gear. Captain Minnelli informed Linda not to walk up
                            the street closer to the site, as there were body parts in the area.
                            They stationed themselves by the post office building and made sure no
                            one else entered the secured premises. They heard a rumbling soon
                            afterwards, and Linda heard people screaming “Run, run!” One of the
                            towers was collapsing. They were engulfed by a cloud of dust. Linda
                            helped to guide people out of the area. She recalled that she had to
                            keep going and to “keep strong.” She remembered what Captain Minnelli
                            had advised her once before, that, “You have to be tough to do this
                            job.” There were inspectors and people around her covered with white
                            dust. At some point, Linda was informed through postal police
                            communications that her girlfriend, who was working nearby, was all
                            right. Her girlfriend had managed to contact the postal police and ask
                            them to communicate this information to Linda. Linda believed that
                            during all this turmoil, her guardian angels were “working overtime.”
                            Linda and the other postal inspectors started walking north—away from
                            site. The second building had collapsed. She met her girlfriend in one
                            of the buildings along the way, and she helped Linda and the people who
                            were with her to get themselves cleaned up and provided them with some
                            food. At the end of the day, Linda took the Long Island Railroad home.
                            On the ride home, she saw the new Manhattan skyline and knew that things
                            would never be the same. She wrote some of these thoughts on a piece of
                            paper while riding the train back home. Linda could not talk about the
                            WTC attacks until a long time had passed. She never sees movies or
                            pictures about the attacks, and cannot believe it when some people ask
                            her if she will ever “get over” the attacks. The next day, on 9/12,
                            Linda went back to work. She and some of coworkers were assigned to work
                            down by the WTC site. She was fitted with a respirator at an East
                            Village health clinic and worked for a few days. She was responsible for
                            escorting trucks that were delivering relief operations cargo across
                            various barricades and checkpoints that were set up along the route to
                            the WTC site. Linda continues to work for USPS; she presently works at
                            their 29th street center in downtown Manhattan, near the new Freedom
                            Tower. After 9/11, she attended several services by St. Patrick’s
                            Cathedral and also received a “purple and black” medal of honor. Linda
                            does not like to talk about the attacks. At times, she feels guilty that
                            she is alive and so many others died. She now feels the need to talk
                            about the attacks and relate her experiences to people. The disaster has
                            made Linda appreciate her life more. She wonders why people cannot be
                            more kind to each other—as they were for a few months after the attacks.
                            She particularly remembers that wonderful sense of unity which existed
                            for a few months after 9/11.

       Joseph worked as an NYPD police officer in the Criminal Justice Bureau.
                            His precinct was by 100 Centre Street, about five blocks from the WTC
                            site. On 9/11, he was driving his wife to work in Garden City, when he
                            heard about the plane attacks over the radio. He tried to establish
                            contact with his precinct when he remembered that the plan for emergency
                            situations was to meet up at the 105th precinct in Queens. He drove his
                            car to that location. He had to show his shield to get by some
                            checkpoints set up along the way. Once at the precinct, he was informed
                            that he would need to go to Floyd Bennett Field, where they would be
                            mobilizing police units to head into the city. Joseph arrived at Floyd
                            Bennett Field at about 2:30 p.m. It took him a long time—nearly an hour
                            and a half to 2 hours from the precinct. On the way, he saw National
                            Guard troops and their Humvees. At Floyd Bennett they mobilized their
                            unit, and took a command bus through the Belt Parkway, by the Verrazano
                            Bridge. Joseph remembered the image of the burning towers ---it was an
                            image he couldn’t turn off, because this was not an image from a
                            television set. Joseph thought about all the training he received in the
                            police academy. He did not know what was going to happen next, and how
                            they would handle that situation. Their command bus crossed over the
                            Brooklyn Bridge and stopped at One Police Plaza. He had all of his gear
                            in a backpack with him. There were news reports that some police
                            officers were missing. People around him were dazed and covered with
                            dust, which looked like “crystal snow,” which he thought later was most
                            likely a mixture of asbestos and glass. He remembers that it seemed like
                            it was the longest day of his life. At about 10 p.m., they mobilized
                            their units to go to 33rd street by the NYC morgue. Joseph remembers
                            that trucks came to the site and delivered orange body bags to the
                            morgue. Joseph remembers thinking that it sort of looked like the movie,
                            “Hamburger Hill.” A police officer, with whom he was working with on
                            that day, broke down and cried. At the morgue, they were mostly
                            responsible for vouchering personal items or identification of bodies
                            that were brought in from the site. He remembers seeing the body of a
                            firefighter, whose face was very badly burnt. There were law enforcement
                            officials taking pictures at the morgue because it was part of the crime
                            scene. Joseph spent the whole night there, and on 9/12 around 7 a.m., he
                            was sent back to his precinct. He spent the day at the precinct—there
                            was no electricity. At the end of the day, he took the LIRR from Penn
                            Station to return home. On the ride home, he noticed that the train
                            station parking lots were still full of cars—a sign that many people
                            were unable to return home. He was relieved to finally be home. The next
                            day, on 9/13, Joseph was sent to the NYC morgue, where he continued to
                            voucher personal items of victims. He remembered body bags coming in the
                            size of “pizza delivery bags” --- that was the size of some of the
                            remnants of victims’ bodies that were found at the WTC site. He began 12
                            hour tours at the site, policing the perimeter. He worked through
                            Christmas 2001, he even missed his son’s 1st birthday that year—but he
                            understood that this was part of his job. Joseph became very sick from
                            working at the site. He had to be taken to SUNY Downstate Medical Center
                            in Brooklyn. Two officers watched over him as he recuperated in the
                            hospital. He heard about other responders who became sick from working
                            long hours at the WTC site. Joe worked through March 2002 at the site,
                            and remembers that they found the body of his field officer/trainer from
                            the 13th precinct. He felt terrible upon hearing the news; the other
                            police officers supported him and told him to “hang in there.” It came
                            to a point that he had to take a night off—he needed a break from
                            working at the site. He also attended the closing ceremonies at the
                            site. Years later, Joseph still finds himself reacting to sudden loud
                            noises, such as plane flying overhead. Sometime his family will ask him
                            what happened. Joseph talked about his experiences to his father, who
                            was a former auxiliary police officer and a Vietnam War veteran. His dad
                            told him, “This is what war is like.” He always worried about a second
                            attack. He does not watch anything on television related to 9/11. Other
                            police officers helped him get through these moments and he appreciates
                            their support. Joseph managed to get into the WTC responder screening
                            program to monitor his health, after he heard about it through his PBA
                            officer. Joseph had formerly worked as an EMT for the Hunter Ambulance
                            Corps, which was led by Mark Schwartz. Mark died on 9/11 trying to
                            rescue people as Tower 2 collapsed. He remembered that Mark was a guy
                            who worked 7 days a week for his family. He once told Joseph that if
                            something did not work out with the police force, Joseph would always
                            have a job with the Hunter Ambulance Corps. Joseph had nightmares after
                            he learned that Mark had passed away. Joseph is grateful for the
                            community support he received after 9/11. Even to this day, when people
                            see him in parades, they thank him. His son, who is now 11 years old,
                            knows a lot about 9/11. Once, his son’s teacher even thanked him for his
                            service at the WTC site. Each year, on the anniversary of 9/11, Joseph
                            tries to remember the day in a quiet way. He goes for a run, or spends
                            time with his family. He recently completed the Town of Hempstead
                            Triathlon—involving running, swimming, and biking. At the triathlon he
                            carried the U.S. flag for a stretch of the journey, and was greatly
                            moved by the amount of support he received from bystanders. His parting
                            words are, “You’ve got make people remember who you are—so they won’t
                            forget.”

       On 9/11/2001, Leo was employed as a sergeant with the Oakland, New Jersey
                            Police Department. He had served as a police officer for 16 years with
                            the NJ police. On that day, he was working a side job in Ridgefield
                            Park, NJ with the public service employees, who were doing some roadway
                            construction near the town center. Leo was monitoring traffic for them
                            while they worked on construction when reports started to filter in that
                            a small plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. People were
                            talking about the incident and were bewildered by the news. When he
                            heard about the second plane crash, he instinctively knew that it was an
                            attack—as he was formerly in the U.S. military. He felt a strong kinship
                            for the law enforcement officials across the river in Manhattan. As a
                            first responder, his immediate thoughts reverted to how they should
                            respond to such an event. He knew he had to be there, “in harm’s way”
                            and immediately thought about what resources his forces would need and
                            how they could best help out. As a police officer, Leo had “sworn an
                            oath not only to protect the U.S. constitution, but also to protect its
                            people,”and he knew that “fear did not take part in this decision.” Leo
                            knew that police officers and other first responders possessed an
                            ingrained “fight” response to such adversity. Leo called his wife of 27
                            years on the cell phone, and told her to get their daughters back from
                            school. His wife understood that he may be called to action, and asked
                            him to keep her posted and to take care. He knew his family was safe, so
                            the next call he made was to the mayor of a town in New Jersey, where he
                            served as a Councilman. Then, he spoke with the lieutenant in his police
                            department about the next course of action. He did not know if there was
                            going to be a nuclear attack, and they were not prepared for
                            bioterrorism. Their town was only twenty miles from the city, and
                            located on top of a hill. They could see the towers burning. The WTC
                            tower had a special significance to Leo—he had proposed to his wife on
                            the top of the towers at the Windows of the World. The towers were part
                            of the NYC landscape, similar to Mt. Rushmore. Leo felt a strong call to
                            respond to the WTC disaster. He knew he had to help. He knew that
                            responders from “all over the world were cut from the same cloth.” His
                            police department was waiting to assess the situation. Leo wanted to put
                            some boots on the ground, to save people and to assist the NYPD. He
                            called up his head office and asked if he could get a patrol car with
                            some officers to go down to the site and assist. His request was denied
                            and he was told go home. Leo went home, but felt emasculated because as
                            a person of action, he knew he had to be at the site helping people. He
                            felt it was shameful that they were not doing anything, and regardless
                            of the “practicality and pragmatism” of the decision, he felt it was
                            wrong not to respond right away. Leo went home and remembered that he
                            saw two F-16 fighter jets flying over his neighborhood towards the WTC
                            site. He recalls that he felt, “very proud to be an American” at that
                            moment. Leo spent the rest of the day watching television coverage of
                            the attacks, with his family --- his wife, his two young daughters, and
                            his mother-in-law and father in law. Ten years later, Leo felt that
                            letting his daughters watch the coverage was the right thing to do. At
                            the tenth anniversary of the attacks, he brought his eldest daughter,
                            now a teenager, to lead a procession of U.K. responders in a march
                            across the Brooklyn Bridge towards the WTC site. He was glad he took his
                            daughter to witness this historical moment. A few days after 9/11, Leo
                            and a small contingent of officers gathered together after work, and
                            went down to Jersey City in hopes of helping out at the WTC site. They
                            wore their badges, brought their guns and walkie-talkies, and boarded an
                            Army Corps of Engineers boat that traveled across the Hudson River to
                            the WTC site. Their squad arrived at the site at about 12 AM. It was
                            foggy, dusty, and the sky was lit up with two large rectangles in memory
                            of the fallen towers. There were supply trucks near the site with all
                            sorts of supplies—gloves, helmets, glasses. There were 30-40 stories of
                            debris, and he saw the “exoskeleton” of the towers. There was a trailer
                            providing hot stew for responders, and he recalls that the responders
                            had to eat while they worked on the pile. New Jersey State Police was
                            there, as well as the FDNY who were very concerned about their
                            “brothers” who were buried in the pile. They walked by the Brooks
                            Brothers store, which was converted to a temporary morgue. Their squad
                            walked around the perimeter of the pile, looking for ways to help, but
                            they felt dejected because there wasn’t much they could do to save
                            people. Leonard Hatton, an FBI agent from Ridgefield Park, New Jersey
                            lost his life on 9/11 while trying to rescue victims from the tower. Leo
                            attended an honor guard ceremony as the Bergen County Sheriff; which was
                            a tribute Mr. Hatton and others from Bergen County who lost their lives
                            on 9/11/2001. Leo is now retired after 25 years of public service. After
                            9/11, he is a firm believer that as Americans, “We will not be stopped
                            from preserving our freedom—our way of life.”

       David, an amateur photographer, was living in Hackensack, NJ at the time
                            of the attacks on September 11th. His photography work always focused on
                            the emotion and spirit of people. Feeling very connected to New York
                            City and recognizing the importance of documenting a historic event, he
                            reached out to several fire departments offering to take pictures and
                            donate the proceeds to the department. Around October, a fire department
                            captain invited David to document his department’s recovery efforts at
                            Ground Zero. His job was to capture the recovery while remaining
                            respectful to the workers and victims. He did not want to
                            sensationalize. The captain who invited David to the site was taking a
                            chance and David did not want to violate his trust. Over the next year,
                            David volunteered by taking over ten-thousand photos to hand out to the
                            responders and donate for fundraisers. The fire fighters accepted David
                            as one of them and as a result he felt a strong sense of purpose. As his
                            health continues to decline along with the other volunteers and
                            responders, he hopes that we can focus on honoring the living through
                            preventative medicine and 9/11 advocacy.

       In April 2000, Joseph was promoted to lieutenant and put in charge of
                            safety and training for the Englewood, New Jersey Fire Department. On
                            the morning of 9/11, he reported to the chief as part of his usual
                            routine and began paperwork. When he heard a plane hit the WTC, he did
                            not pay too much attention, thinking that it was a terrible accident.
                            His thoughts were with the people in the building and with his brethren
                            FDNY firefighters, who would have challenging tasks ahead of them. He
                            gathered with his comrades and watched the news on television. When he
                            watched the 2nd plane hit the building, he was at first confused,
                            thinking that it was an instant replay. It took a moment to sink in, but
                            he was primarily in shock and disbelief. The firefighters in the room
                            were very quiet; they believed it was an act of war, but also believed
                            that the FDNY could handle it. He said simply, “We were like the rest of
                            the country--worried spectators.” He was in the truck room when someone
                            came to tell him that the building collapsed. He thought it would be
                            impossible and that the guy was kidding. He said to him, “That is not
                            something to joke about…” But at that point he knew the FDNY would need
                            them. He then went to check their equipment and figure out which pieces
                            could be converted easily and sent to the effort. The chief, who was
                            involved with urban search and rescue, left for NYC, and the deputy
                            chief, now in charge, recalled all firefighters to the house. He was
                            first assigned to the ferry terminal in Hoboken, NJ. As part of the
                            HAZMAT team, they organized washing stations for a mass detoxification
                            of the people fleeing Manhattan. It was unknown at the time if there was
                            anthrax or any other dangerous chemicals in the planes. He pointed out
                            that the people he saw were just so relieved to be in safe place. They
                            didn’t mind bathing in front of strangers and colleagues. During this
                            time, communication was poor and rumors of the devastation were rampant.
                            At some point, he heard that 25,000 people were killed. His role was to
                            comfort people coming through the washing station, and explain the
                            purpose and help people feel safer. Later that night, he returned home.
                            The next few weeks he went with the team to the pile for search and
                            rescue. Although practically speaking, he knew that on Sept 12th the
                            rescue mission was futile, he still hoped for a miracle. He described
                            coming into the city over the George Washington Bridge and the crowds
                            lining the Westside Highway. He felt it was nice that people came out to
                            support them, but it was also awkward because they hadn’t done anything
                            yet. They were processed through a center that was also a makeshift
                            morgue, with burnt bodies piled on each other. He recalled seeing a
                            burnt fire truck and feared the instability of the buildings. He felt
                            that he was in a dangerous situation and he recalls seeing particulates
                            in the air and thinking it was not healthy. However, the desire to find
                            survivors took precedence over these fears, and the camaraderie among
                            the workers helped too. He recalled seeing a priest, rabbi, and minister
                            walking around the site, passing out chicken nuggets, cigarettes, and
                            bottled water. He recalled the unity of all and this provided the
                            workers with a sense of strength. Joe was then assigned to the Military
                            Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, NJ, to identify using excavation and other
                            tools and to send them to the pile. Overall, Joe didn’t feel that this
                            work impacted him personally. He felt strong support from his wife and
                            colleagues and felt the camaraderie helped. However, he did mention that
                            one day he came home and cried in the car, before he put on his brave
                            face to show his wife and kids. He avoids watching 9/11 commemorative
                            events and television shows. He hopes that he has closed that door and
                            moved on with his life. He chooses not to dwell on the past.

       On the morning of September 11th, 2001, Tito, the EMS supervisor for Fort
                            Lee, NJ Port Authority, was admiring the beautiful day when he heard his
                            house phone, pager, and cell all go off simultaneously to alert him of
                            the attacks. Based on his experience with the 1993 WTC bombing, he knew
                            he should pack for a few days because New Jersey might be called in for
                            assistance. Tito arrived that the Port Authority, at the George
                            Washington bridge just twenty minutes before the towers fell. The area
                            was chaotic with plenty of people all ready to help. Tito began to
                            organize strike teams each with a radio to respond to West Street as
                            needed. This was not a pre-planned procedure but after the attacks, this
                            procedure became the foundations for a new system. These strike teams
                            would go in and report back to Tito what was needed. Throughout the day
                            more nurses, doctors, and ambulances from surrounding states began to
                            arrive eager to help and frustrated to be held back by Tito. Tito, also
                            eager to respond said to them “from what we’re hearing they’re not
                            pulling a lot of people out and the sad reality is that we don’t know
                            what tomorrow will bring.” There was a feeling of helplessness among
                            medical personnel because there was no one to treat. On Saturday, Tito
                            went down to the site with one of the strike teams. He remembers seeing
                            a bar stopped in time with tables set for customers. Seeing the
                            devastation in person was surreal. He quickly noticed the poor air
                            quality and calls this the “tragedy after the tragedy” recognizing that
                            there would be long lasting effects on those who survived and involved
                            in the recovery. After this experience Tito says he appreciates the
                            people he has in his life. Life is precious and so full of chance.

       Michael was in his law firm's office in Manhattan on 9/11 when he saw
                            from his office that the World Trade Towers were on fire. Michael worked
                            as an immigration lawyer, and is a former federal prosecutor and also an
                            EMT with the Jewish Ambulance Corps ‘Hatzolah,’ the largest
                            volunteer-drive ambulance corps in the world. As a federal prosecutor,
                            Michael had testified before Congress on an anti-terrorism bill. He was
                            also a father of four children and feared for his children’s safety upon
                            learning of the WTC attacks. Michael remembered the chaos and lack of
                            communication following the attacks. As a part of the ambulance corps he
                            was able to drive down to Ground Zero and remembers seeing “severe and
                            heart wrenching” images. There were photo frames from office buildings
                            shattered on the ground, body parts, and personal effects of people. He
                            was surprised that he could get so close to the site with unfettered
                            access. He participated in the Bucket Brigade for some hours and recalls
                            that there were some M.A.S.H. (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) units set
                            up.

       Philip, ‘Phil’, is currently retired from the FDNY where he worked for 40
                            years. He lives on Long Island. September 10th, 2001 was Phil’s
                            birthday, on which he worked the 6pm to 6am shift that day. He had a
                            good friend that had told him he should get a different job, that he was
                            getting too old to do this anymore. They parted ways and said goodbye
                            that day, but Phil was never again to see his good friend. 343 men were
                            lost from the NYC fire department, 54 were in Phil’s department. On
                            9/10, Phil had just finished working his shift, and was driving home to
                            Southold, Long Island. He went to band practice and then a retirement
                            party for a colleague, and then he went home. He got home at 2am and
                            woke up at 8:30am and turned on the T.V. to Channel 5. He remembers
                            seeing Dave Price reporting on the WTC attacks. Phil knew right away
                            that this was an act of terrorism. He rushed out and went back to the
                            city to where his unit was. He arrived just as the 1st tower was coming
                            down. He was asked along with other chiefs and ironworkers to clear West
                            Street. He worked through the night and the next day and remembers that
                            he did not wear a mask. The North Bridge had collapsed on one side and
                            there were 10 stories of rubble on the other side. He went under the
                            North Bridge along with some newbie firefighters to do search and
                            rescue. They found the body of a jumper. He remembers looking around and
                            the newbies said they didn’t see anything. Phil said “look closer.” They
                            looked again, and saw nothing. Phil told them to look at the collapsed
                            railing. Attached to the railing were 5 fingers and that is how they
                            found the body. The corpse was taken to the morgue. They found other
                            bodies that were identified as jumpers, but no survivors. He remembered
                            that when a body was found, it was first placed on a stretcher, then in
                            a Stokes basket, and then in a body bag. A chaplain, GPS, and EMS all
                            saluted the Stokes basket as the body was transported out of the rubble.
                            For the first few days, Phil worked continuously from 7am to 7pm. When
                            he was not at the site, he worked his regular tour. He would sleep in a
                            chair or trailer. At funerals, he played the drums. He said that he
                            pretty much worked 24 hours a day for a few weeks. He couldn’t wear a
                            respirator because it interfered with talking over the walkie-talkies.
                            After 7 to 10 days, he found victims based on the decaying smell of
                            bodies--that was another reason why they didn’t wear respirators. Even
                            though the EPA said the air quality was ok, he knew it wasn’t.
                            Pulverized glass…that was what was left--- not shards, but just
                            pulverized glass and the smell of deceased victims. That was what filled
                            the air at Ground Zero. Phil remembers one good thing, which happened
                            after he attended a funeral in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. After the service,
                            he went outside. People lined the street and they all applauded for the
                            responders as they left the church. He remembers feeling survivor’s
                            guilt. He lost over 200 friends and that was very difficult. He
                            remembers going to a local joint called 10and10 for something to eat at
                            3am. He went in, and there were people serving food to the responders.
                            Bernadette Peters and Harrison Ford were some of the famous people
                            serving food. He remembers that they had tears in their eyes. Every year
                            he goes for physical check-ups, and in 2006, he started having lower
                            lung capacity problems. In 2008, he had cancer in his right lung, which
                            was removed. He was told it was due to exposure to the toxins at Ground
                            Zero, because the biopsy showed a result that had never been seen
                            before. When asked if he would do anything differently knowing what the
                            results would be, he said “no.” He would do the same thing. He said that
                            being in the FDNY is the best job in the world despite the tears. He
                            feels that 9/11 made people more aware, but he hopes they do not forget.
                            He is afraid for our country and fears it will happen again. He said
                            that during the Clinton administration, we were attacked 5 times. The
                            last attack was on the U.S.S. Cole, when 19 sailors died a horrible
                            death. He said that Clinton was concerned about his legacy, and not with
                            the terrorists. Osama bin Ladin said "American Soldiers Are Paper
                            Tigers” and Clinton did nothing except… Monica Lewinsky. Firefighters
                            are not unique, they just do their jobs. He does not feel he is a hero.
                            The guys who died on 9/11 were the real heroes. To this day, Phil wears
                            his FDNY shirt or a hat, so that people remember 9/11. He thinks people
                            forget that this country is still under attack. Phil has also written
                            several books “Laughter, Tears and Muffled Drums”, and “Bringing
                            Everybody Home” and has a 3rd book in the works.

       Gerard (Jerry) is the eldest of 6 siblings. He was married in July 2001
                            and now has three children, including twins. He is originally from
                            Smithtown, Long Island and then he moved to the St. James area. Jerry
                            has worked as a special agent for the Treasury Department since 1991,
                            working primarily on narcotics investigations and crimes against the
                            United States. At the time of 9/11, he was working for the El Dorado
                            Task Force as a Special Agent. His office was located at Number Four
                            World Trade Center, one of the smaller buildings adjacent to the World
                            Trade Center towers. Jerry was commuting from St. James every day, and
                            each day at work was different. On the morning of 9/11, he had two new
                            recruits that were starting. He had taken the train to work that day,
                            but normally he would have driven to work. If he had driven, he would
                            have parked beneath one of the towers and we probably wouldn’t have this
                            story. Instead, he took the train to Penn Station and then got on the
                            subway. He heard a muffled eruption and as he got off the subway people
                            were running towards him. He heard someone say it was a car bomb but he
                            didn’t see anything that looked like that. He could see a hole in the
                            North Tower; paper, metal and glass were falling from the sky. He headed
                            towards his office and started helping people as they were going down
                            the escalator. Everyone was dirty, some bleeding. He saw one woman whose
                            lip was hanging off so he helped her to an ambulance. He kept hearing
                            things hitting the ground but didn’t know what it was coming from. Later
                            he learned, it was jumpers hitting the ground or the overpass trying to
                            escape the flames. They had no choice, either burn to death or jump.
                            Emergency vehicles started showing up more and more and then the 2nd
                            plane hit but he didn’t see it; he was under the South Tower. An engine
                            that was on fire flew over his head and crashed into a nearby Burger
                            King. A ball of fire flew in his direction and he jumped under a
                            sanitation truck for protection. There was a lady on the other side of
                            the truck who wanted to get out, but he told her she had to stay for
                            safety. There was debris everywhere. He ended up grabbing her hair so
                            she wouldn’t leave. He said he went into survival mode. He saw his four
                            month old son Connor’s face flash before him. Jerry said he just wanted
                            to be able to see his son again. He finally let go of the woman’s hair
                            and doesn’t know where she went. Shortly after that he also left the
                            safety of the sanitation truck and ended up jumping over a fence,
                            landing on people as they were running towards a subway. He ran north
                            and went into a tunnel and hugged a pole underground as a train was
                            coming. Through all this, he clung to his briefcase. He got on a subway
                            and went just a few stops before getting off. He saw jets overhead and
                            didn’t know if they were under attack. He headed towards the Empire
                            State Building. Cell phones were down. He got on a train leaving NY and
                            he could see the smoke as the train was heading east. He heard people
                            talking on the train, saying that the Pentagon had been hit as well. All
                            his emergency equipment was in his car. His wife picked him up at the
                            train station in Huntington and then he went to Hauppauge where his car
                            was and headed back to the city. By that time the buildings had
                            collapsed and he knew the goal now would be to find people. He recalls
                            the smell, dust and dirt. It permeated everything. He headquarters was
                            temporarily placed on the Intrepid. He would send agents out to do
                            interviews. His other office was one of the smaller buildings in the
                            Trade Center. Damage was done to parts of the building but not all of
                            it. He would go there 2 or 3 times a day trying to get in and find
                            evidence. The glass was gone on his side of the building and he could
                            sit in his chair and look down into the giant hole. He took the flag
                            that was on his desk and loaded his duffel bag with evidence from past
                            cases, as well as his computer. From the promenade he would climb the
                            piles of debris. He would go through a hole and be in the basement of
                            his building. He would do this for weeks. He remembers EPA started
                            showing up so he knew things were going on with the air quality. He
                            remembers seeing Christie Todd Whitman wearing a large full face mask.
                            He did not work on the pile or in the pit; he would safeguard criminal
                            evidence of cases prior to 911 and now. That was his assignment. He
                            remembers seeing George Bush speaking on the pile and he remembers that
                            when horns blew, everyone ran for cover. He remembers sometimes sleeping
                            on the Intrepid. When he did go home, he would leave all his clothes
                            outside. He knows what was on them, the smell, dust, and powder. Jerry
                            made a shadow box of some things. He remembers people lining the
                            highways cheering; he thought that was weird. Bystanders would give out
                            water, socks, gloves, and hard hats. The only thing he took was water
                            because he thought that the other things were for the responders and he
                            didn’t feel he was entitled to any of those items. He even felt guilty
                            taking the water. He doesn’t go back to the site and doesn’t care about
                            the memorial. He doesn’t feel like a hero. He was lucky that day. He
                            remembers always clinging to his briefcase and feels that whatever he
                            did was just part of his job. When he was on the train he heard one
                            person say, "Our lives will be totally different from here on; we need
                            to be aware and cautious." He was an agent for 10 years before 9/11 and
                            feels his training helped him survive. He didn’t lose anyone close to
                            him and didn’t go to any funerals…but he always clung to his briefcase.

       Daniel, ‘Dan’ was a retired New York City firefighter and was working as
                            a registered nurse at Rikers Island at the time of 9/11. He was asleep
                            that morning in his house, when his daughter called to inform him that a
                            plane had hit one of the WTC towers. He thought it may have been a small
                            plane, and most likely an accident. Then, the second plane hit the other
                            tower, and soon after he got a phone call that his son, a New York City
                            firefighter, had responded to the attacks. Dan was very worried about
                            his son, as he watched the events unfold on T.V. and the towers
                            collapse. He met his wife, who was playing a game of golf that morning
                            at a local golf course. When his wife found out that their son had
                            responded to the attacks, she broke down. Dan was able to contact his
                            daughter-in-law, who took care of his wife, and then he decided to go
                            down to Ground Zero to find his son. He stopped at a few local volunteer
                            firehouses to explain his situation, and to try to get an extra
                            “turnout” coat (firefighting gear) from them. He had difficulty
                            obtaining the gear, but took his car anyway and drove on the LIE and
                            over the FDR Bridge to Ground Zero. He was stopped a couple of times on
                            the way, but was able to show his retired firefighter badge and got
                            through the security. Dan parked his car near a firehouse by South
                            Street Seaport about a mile away from Ground Zero, and walked towards
                            the site. He was wearing only civilian clothing and there was dust
                            everywhere. He went down to a couple of firehouses to find out about his
                            son, but no one had any information about him. He was 4 or 5 blocks
                            away, when WTC building 7 collapsed. He borrowed a cell phone from a
                            civilian and called his wife, who told him that their son had contacted
                            her, and that he was okay. Dan was happy and relieved that his son was
                            alive. He went back to his car, which was covered in dust, and drove
                            home. The next day, he found out that his friend and fellow firefighter,
                            Frank, had perished in the attacks. He decided to help out in the rescue
                            and recovery process and for the next 20 days, he traveled to Ground
                            Zero by himself to assist in the rescue, recovery, and clean-up process.
                            Dan remembers the deep camaraderie he experienced with the other workers
                            on the pile. He particularly recalls working with Department of
                            Transportation workers. He remembers that people were very charitable,
                            giving out free gloves for responders. Nurses came around and offered to
                            provide eye-washes for responders, who spent several hours on the dusty
                            pile. Dan remembers seeing body parts, “arms and hands.” He was a
                            firefighter for 25 years, and had seen many bodies before, so he was
                            hardened to this experience. Dan recalls that while exploring one of the
                            tunnels in the pile, he came across a golf ball. He used to play golf
                            with Frank and he thought it was eerie that he should find something
                            that reminded him of Frank in these tunnels. He later took the golf ball
                            and buried it in a memorial that he built for Frank in his hometown.
                            While working on the pile, Dan was wearing firefighter gear from the
                            1980s. He was questioned a few times because of his outdated apparel. He
                            wanted to stay longer than the time he actually spent on the pile, but
                            was told that the situation was under control by professional
                            responders. After 9/11, he contacted Frank’s wife and decided to build a
                            monument for Frank and other firefighters and civilians who perished in
                            the towers. He managed to get donations and permission from the Town of
                            Brookhaven and built these memorials for Frank and other fallen 9/11
                            firefighters in the harbor town of Port Jefferson, Long Island. Dan
                            attended approximately 25 funerals after 9/11 in honor of fallen
                            firefighters and police officers. He remembers that the saddest moment
                            of his experience was watching people jumping out of the burning towers
                            on television. Dan feels that this young generation of Americans is
                            exceptional, especially those firefighters who went into the burning
                            towers without hesitation to rescue people. It was terribly unfortunate
                            that so many of them never returned home to their families. Dan also
                            remembers the deep camaraderie he felt with other responders, and one
                            particularly “happy” experience at Ground Zero: “I was coming out of
                            this tunnel, and there were all these people with pails who were passing
                            (stuff) down. I came out of the tunnel and had black soot on my face…and
                            these people started cheering for me. I felt pretty good about that.
                            Later on, somebody took a picture with all the black soot on my face,
                            which I still have.”

       On 9/11/2001, Michael was a NYPD officer working in the Harbor Unit based
                            in Brooklyn. He had worked for the NYPD for 14 years. On that Tuesday
                            morning, he was scheduled to monitor the primary elections at a school
                            near the 69th precinct in Brooklyn. A voter at the polling booth told
                            him that a plane had struck one of the World Trade Center buildings. He
                            thought it was most likely a mistake, until he heard a scream and saw
                            the TV coverage of the attack on the building. He called over his radio
                            into the 69th precinct for a ride into his regular post at the Harbor
                            Unit. He arrived to the post to see the smoke and flames emerging from
                            the towers over the skyline of Manhattan. He took a police boat with
                            five other officers and a sergeant into the North Cove Marina. On the
                            way, the towers collapsed and when they arrived at the Marina, there
                            were people looking to evacuate. Michael and the others started to load
                            up the boats to bring people to safety. Michael also managed to get his
                            brother, who worked in the area, over to Brooklyn. Michael remembered
                            one situation where small boat broke the security zone on the East
                            River. It turned out to be a man who was trying to find his uncle.
                            Michael felt this man was extremely lucky he was harmed by law
                            enforcement officers, since everyone was on heightened alert during this
                            time. Michael ferried nearly a thousand people out of the area. He was
                            there until about three or four in the morning. Michael also discussed
                            his experiences responding other major disasters such as the Flight 800
                            disaster and the Far Rockaway crash. For him, the Far Rockaway crash was
                            by far one of the most macabre.

       On 9/11/2001, Kevin was a recent transfer to the Emergency Management
                            Services division within the New Jersey State Police. He had been in law
                            enforcement for 15 years. His transfer was in effect for 9-11-2001 but
                            he had contracted meningitis and was on leave from work. Kevin watched
                            the events unfold on television and wanted to get back to work to assist
                            with the NJ law enforcement response. He went back early to get
                            clearance for work from his doctor, and on September 22, 2001 he started
                            working at the Family Assistance Center in Liberty State Park, which was
                            set up to provide counseling and assistance to families of WTC victims
                            from New Jersey. New Jersey lost 746 victims to the WTC attacks. The
                            Family Assistance Center provided various resources for family members
                            of NJ WTC victims including mental health and grief counseling services,
                            bereavement counseling services, FEMA aid, Small Business Administration
                            (SBA) aid, Salvation Army and American Red Cross counselors, Department
                            of Motor Vehicle assistance, and issuance of death certificates. The
                            center also had a memory board for families to post pictures of their
                            loved ones who died in the attacks. One of Kevin’s first assignments was
                            to attend a meeting at the Family Assistance Center and make
                            arrangements for NJ family members to visit the WTC site by boat over
                            the NY Waterway. Over the next few months, they provided two shuttle
                            runs per week to the WTC site. The NJ state troopers brought over nearly
                            100 families per trip to the WTC site. The troopers would conduct
                            security sweeps of the boats with dogs prior to departure and checked
                            identification of those on board. Kevin recalled that the troopers
                            formed strong bonds with many of the family members and even with the
                            mental health counselors who travelled with the families to assist them
                            through the grieving process. They troopers felt good about the
                            providing those services also knew that the family members appreciated
                            and needed their assistance. They also learned how to prepare for
                            reactions that families would have to seeing the WTC site, and how to
                            guide them during a tour of the site. Many of the moments that Kevin and
                            other NJ state troopers experienced with the families of WTC victims
                            were outside the realm of what they were taught at the police academy.
                            They worked long days, sometimes from 6 a.m. to 11 pm. at the Family
                            Assistance Center without any time off. Especially considering the type
                            of work he did at the Family Assistance Center, Kevin realized that he
                            needed to spend time with his family and, on Halloween 2001, he asked
                            his boss for some time off to go trick-or-treating with his daughter.
                            Kevin also developed a bond with some of the other people he worked
                            with, and he is still friends with many of them to this day. Kevin also
                            mentioned the summer before 9/11; he had taken his children to the top
                            of the WTC towers. His son was in fourth grade at the time of 9/11 and
                            was very upset that the people who worked at the top of the towers were
                            killed. His son later wrote a poem titled “The Internal Red Fire” about
                            9/11 responders, for which he was awarded a scholarship from a family
                            member of a WTC victim. As a result of his work, Kevin formed valuable
                            friendships with those people he worked with at the Family Assistance
                            Center and some of the family members of WTC victims. He worked at the
                            Family Assistance Center through March 2002, and still attends WTC
                            victims’ family reunions each 9/11 anniversary at Liberty State Park,
                            New Jersey.

       Stephen worked for the Department of Emergency Management in New Jersey
                            as part of the State Troopers office. He was off work on 9/11 for a
                            doctor’s appointment and was on the phone when someone told him that the
                            first plane hit. He headed to the NJ Port Authority Center to see what
                            he could do to help. National response cellular and radio communications
                            were cut when the 2nd plane hit. He would get information regarding
                            coordinating certain things, but said it all seemed surreal, especially
                            when he heard the fighter jets overhead. Stephen said that many people
                            tried to find safe haven in New Jersey and took whatever boats they
                            could to cross the Hudson River. He said that the adrenaline kept people
                            going. It was a day or 2 before he had the chance to get to Ground Zero,
                            where everything was just pulverized. There were no chairs, desks or
                            computers, only steel beams. The smell was overwhelming. Stephen has 20
                            years of Emergency Medical Services training and knew he would see many
                            people die from the health effects of the WTC disaster in the years to
                            come. People would line the streets holding flags and cheering; others
                            held pictures of their lost loved ones. Liberty State Park in New Jersey
                            was set up as a Family Assistance Center. Every day Stephen would have
                            to walk past a bulletin board that had pictures of missing people; notes
                            that said ‘In memory of’ or ‘Have you seen this person?'. It was
                            overwhelming. He would work 16-18 hour days at the center, and soon
                            gained weight from the inactivity of just sitting all the time. His wife
                            has a strong educational background in psychology, so he took her to
                            Ground Zero so she could see the devastation and understand what he was
                            going through. She ended up volunteering for a while. Stephen went to
                            the Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island once or twice and saw the
                            conveyors that were used to sift through the debris searching for body
                            parts or anything that could be used to identify someone. The responders
                            working here were looking for friends and neighbors. Part of Stephen's
                            job was to take people on the boats from NJ to NY to see the
                            devastation. He felt honored to help these people and felt it was his
                            duty. Initially, he was assigned to the emergency management area and
                            then in mid-October he went to work in the Governor’s office, helping to
                            set up programs and resources that were badly needed to help families.
                            Stephen said that geographically and chronologically, the further away
                            people were from the WTC disaster, the more he noticed that they would
                            forget or did not care about the tragedy. After 2 or 3 years, people who
                            lived in Battery Park City did not want tourists visiting and looking
                            around. They were done with disaster and wanted to move on. Stephen said
                            that we were a complacent country before 9/11, but not anymore. He said
                            that while many died on that day, an amazing number of people lived and
                            were saved by first responders. He hopes our society allows this event
                            to be taught in schools as part of history, so that children will learn
                            and remember about that day. Stephen says there are no guarantees in
                            life and no promises for a future. If not for his wife, he would have
                            had a nervous breakdown. He said this was the darkest time of his life
                            and he expressed gratitude to his wife for helping him through this
                            time, and understanding what he was going through. Now when they talk
                            about taking a trip, they do it. They make plans and follow through.
                            They do not take anything for granted.

       James was working a job at a school in Islip doing ironwork on 9/11. His
                            boss came and told him that planes had flown into the towers and James
                            thought, "How horrible," and immediately became emotional. He felt the
                            need to go; his dad was an iron worker as well, so the profession was in
                            his blood. James said that for some unknown reason prior to 9/11, he had
                            begun taking supplies and equipment from the company he was working for.
                            It was just small amounts, but enough to start a decent stockpile. He
                            took torches and oxygen and other cutting equipment. He didn’t know why
                            he was taking it; he said he just knew he had to. So when James heard of
                            the disaster, he decided on his own to go to Ground Zero. He called his
                            good friend, Lance, to go with him. He felt this was his opportunity to
                            do something good, something he could be proud of. For once in his life
                            he had something to offer so he loaded up his Dodge Ram and headed down
                            the expressway. He felt that everything that happened was for a
                            reason--this was something he learned while in AA. He ended up around
                            the Jacob Javits center and followed a bus into Ground Zero. The scene
                            was like the movie "Planet of the Apes"--everything was covered in a
                            snowy dust. He and Lance fudged their way around a restricted area and
                            ended up on an empty street. He went to work by the American Express
                            building, cutting and burning steel using the tools he had taken from
                            his job. He felt guilty about that, but said that he realized that this
                            was the reason he took those tools from work. James says he has his
                            demons but at that moment when he was working at Ground Zero, for the
                            first time in his life he felt "110%." He felt completely focused for
                            the first time in his life, and this had never happened to him before or
                            after 9/11. At one point, while working by the pile, James went through
                            a walkway that had collapsed and he saw the leg of a fireman sticking
                            up. Firemen would put a glow stick in an area, and then the iron workers
                            would go in and dig. James had hoped to find some survivors-- but he
                            never did. James spoke about a letter he received from a fourth grade
                            student that was in a box of cookies sent to thank the WTC responders.
                            He said that made him feel so good and so appreciated. He remembers
                            walking around St. Mark’s Church, and passed a restaurant where the
                            tables were set. It was as if the place were frozen in time but covered
                            in dust. The cars in the parking lot were covered with dust and debris.
                            James said that he just walked around and found places to work. Fires
                            would spontaneously erupt; it was scary. James doesn’t even like to
                            watch TV anymore. He doesn’t like scenes where cars are racing down the
                            road. It brings back very bad memories. The enormity and finality of
                            all, the insanity, he doesn’t have the words to describe how he felt.
                            Someone had said to him “(It) smells like death kid, worse than
                            Vietnam”. James said that he felt bad because he felt good about working
                            at Ground Zero. He felt guilty that this was the first time in his life
                            that he felt “110%.” James felt like he was part of a family-- a
                            brotherhood. He worked 14-18 hour days for about 2 weeks. He wore no
                            face mask or protective equipment while working Ground Zero. After a
                            while, when he realized that he was not going to find any survivors, it
                            became more like a business and like a regular job, and then he didn’t
                            feel any satisfaction from the work. So then he left and got a job with
                            a union as an ironworker. James spoke about how the ironworkers write
                            the floor number in soapstone on the front of the beams when a building
                            is being built. When he was at Ground Zero, he saw some of these numbers
                            on the fallen beams. In 2003, James had a fall on a work site and was
                            badly injured. He has had over 14 surgeries since that time and has been
                            mostly on disability. He is 41 years old and said “life is just a bag of
                            minutes”. He is grateful that righteousness prevailed. His faith became
                            stronger and he feels closer to God. He told us that he felt it was God
                            that was asking him to take that equipment, because he would need it to
                            help when he went to dig at Ground Zero. He said there are no
                            coincidences in life. There is no place he would rather have been at the
                            time.

       Scott was a fire department paramedic who also worked part-time as a
                            voluntary hospital paramedic until 2000, when he left the FD and started
                            working for the hospital full-time, based in Brooklyn. He’s married with
                            three kids; at the time of 9/11 one was school-aged and the others 11
                            months and 2 years old. On 9/11, he was in the middle of a double shift
                            that had started at 11pm on 9/10. He was out with the ambulance, and
                            someone came up and asked if they had heard about the plane hitting the
                            WTC tower. They drove back to their base, and saw that the second plane
                            had hit—which made him realize it was terrorism. Scott was then
                            dispatched to go to the WTC with his partner Joe and a 3 others,
                            including a student. When they emerged from the Battery Tunnel, they
                            could see the gaping holes in the towers. His first thought was that he
                            hoped they weren’t setting up triage on the 23rd floor, as they had done
                            in the 1993 attack. But then they started to see jumpers. Knowing
                            something bad was happening, he took out his cell and called a friend.
                            Scott couldn’t remember his wife’s work number, so he asked this friend
                            to let his wife know he was going in. He thinks now that he did this
                            because he thought he might not survive what was ahead. In that moment,
                            Scott remembered that in the terrorism training he’d had, they had
                            talked about secondary attacks, which were meant to harm the first
                            responders. All sorts of thoughts came to him: “First dead cop I see,
                            I’m going to take his gun,” for protection. Everyone in the ambulance
                            was quiet, hearing rumors flying over the radio. The ambulance parked on
                            West St. and Scott said that it didn’t seem real, as they watched people
                            jumping from the buildings, one after the other. He saw two people
                            holding hands as they fell, and another who seemed to glide across
                            Liberty St. He was fixating on them, and his partner told him to snap
                            out of it. As they crossed the street, they had to avoid debris and
                            jumpers. He saw his friend Rick who was also on the job, who joined
                            them. As they crossed the street, Scott was hit by a piece of falling
                            sheet metal, which he deflected with his arm. They went into the
                            Marriott, where his partner insisted on bandaging the hand that had just
                            been hit. Rick left to find the triage, and Scott was left with only his
                            partner and student. As they approached the doors of the South Tower,
                            they heard a rumbling. Scott pushed the student, telling him to “Run,
                            just run.” They all began to run in the direction from which they had
                            come, making it maybe 15 steps before the atrium began to implode with
                            the building. He dove behind a large marble planter and covered his neck
                            and head as everything went black. He couldn’t breathe, and thought he
                            would die. He realized his mouth was filled with debris. He tried to
                            call for help, and as he lay there covered in debris, he thought of his
                            children and realized, “You have to get out.” He got up and found a
                            fireman who was also trying to make his way out—he grabbed one another,
                            and got to a clearing. They found other survivors, and hesitated when
                            they wanted to descend a staircase that led to ground level, but went
                            because he realized, “I wasn’t scared to die. I was scared to die
                            alone.” They found a loading dock and ran out, while debris still fell
                            around them. Scott stopped to help a pair of EMTs, one of whom was
                            injured, and ran into his old partner. They loaded the EMT into a stair
                            chair they grabbed from a crushed ambulance, and headed to the North
                            Tower, then to a building across the street to finish helping her. Then
                            that tower began to fall, and they ran with her stretcher down the hall.
                            Again, Scott tried to take cover as the explosion came through the
                            building. A number of people took refuge in a perfume store, and he
                            recalls many men calling their wives, crying. They exited through the
                            back of the building and were directed on where to take the stretcher by
                            some cops. He found his partner Joe, and they found some gear and went
                            to find more injured people on West St. A fire hydrant was open and many
                            were trying to wash themselves. They began to rinse everyone’s eyes with
                            saline. For a time they sat, and Scott remembers hundreds of people on
                            the street, a woman coming out of her apartment building to hand the
                            responders bottled water, and then firefighters and police officers from
                            other areas start to make their way in. Scott realizes now that he was
                            in shock, and operating on auto pilot, so much so that he didn’t even
                            really think about the fact that the buildings has collapsed. Scott and
                            Joe ended up at St. Vincent’s, where he saw 50-100 nurses and doctors
                            standing at the ready, with no patients. Scott’s wounds were treated
                            there. While there, he found a phone and his wife’s number and called
                            her. It turned out that he hadn’t told his friend where she worked, so
                            she hadn’t known he was at the WTC. Eventually Scott began to walk to
                            Beekman Hospital to try and find his colleague Pete, and met a cop he
                            knew, who later told him he was “talking gibberish.” He hitched a ride
                            to Brooklyn and found out that Pete was in surgery. He showered and got
                            gear together, ate lunch. He was then ordered to get evaluated at their
                            hospital—Scott got a physical exam and a psych eval, and was given
                            Ativan and told to go home. He got home at 11pm, where his brother and
                            wife were waiting. “Greatest hug I ever got in my life.” His brother
                            mentioned concerns about asbestos and told him he needed to get checked
                            out. He remembers feeling confused and wondering why he was home. The
                            next day, he cried often, and checked in with a number of friends. He
                            found out Rick hadn’t checked in with his wife yet, and eventually had
                            him put on the missing list. A week later he was still missing, and they
                            spoke again and Scott informed her of the benefits she’d be due. They
                            found Rick’s body in January 2002. Scott was debriefed in a group
                            setting about two weeks after 9/11; there he spoke with his partner and
                            student and together they pieced together the entire story of what had
                            happened, filling in blanks for each other. Scott returned to work at
                            the end of September, and recalls that he was having trouble coping, as
                            was his boss. He was called to respond to the plane crash in the
                            Rockaways, and a colleague recommended that he stay behind, and he
                            agreed. In January he decided to take a month’s leave, and then decided
                            he needed another month. Then—he knew his career was over. He had lost
                            his edge. He has guilt about the death of Rick; he blamed himself for a
                            long time. He says the most horrible thing is to be “so aware of the
                            things you’re doing, but you can’t stop” in reference to his resulting
                            anger, depression, anxiety, etc. He would melt down while caring for his
                            kids; it was a rough time and he thinks now he might have been suicidal.
                            Scott remembers thinking, “I can’t let this be the sum of my life.” He
                            had to work through it all; he says his family was understanding, but
                            many people he knew never knew he had been through it because Scott
                            never brought it up. Within a few months, be began to withdraw from
                            friends, feeling no one understood and he didn’t want to hear others
                            talk about the day. Scott felt underappreciated, and that EMT/paramedics
                            were not recognized. He used to attend therapy at South Nassau Hospital,
                            where he had one-on-one therapy and a group with others who had
                            responded on 9/11. This was the first place his PTSD was diagnosed, and
                            he has lasting friendships from that setting. He’s also had a number of
                            surgeries, including 4 on his hand. He doesn’t like to read or watch
                            things about 9/11. Scott loved being a paramedic and misses belonging to
                            a community at work. He feels like an outsider now. Scott says that in
                            many ways, he wakes up every morning and has to remember to “become me
                            again.” Only now is he able to do things like have a catch with his son.
                            He wants to belong to society.

       Mary lives in a small town in Pennsylvania. She worked at Lucent
                            Technologies and Kraft Foods in Lehigh Valley in 2001. She lost both
                            jobs within a couple of weeks after 9/11, and didn’t find work again
                            until close to the official end of the recovery work at the WTC site.
                            She had worked the night shift the day prior to 9/11, and she woke up to
                            the reports of the first plane crash on the television. She was home
                            alone until she had to go back to work at about 2pm, feeling quite
                            lonely. When she got home, she watched more news reports, and saw a
                            number listed for those who wanted to help—unable to get it out of her
                            mind, she called. The Chapel of the Four Chaplains in Philadelphia was
                            looking for drivers to take chaplains to the WTC site. Mary’s first ride
                            was in early October, when she drove a chaplain to the Salvation Army
                            HQ. In general, they would check in with the SA, get badges, and then
                            get bussed down to the site, where she would help in the tents while the
                            chaplains went out around the site. Mary helped set up the Salvation
                            Army tent. She says that so many different people came there, looking
                            for gloves, food, masks, even cigarettes. “I just thought it was
                            something I had to do. Somebody’s gotta do it.” Mary recalls watching
                            Boris Yeltsin in the pit, surrounded by his guards. Of the site, she
                            says, “It was sacred ground.” When riding the subway, she would notice
                            that people were different: “It was a different kind of city.” Mary
                            didn’t share what she was feeling with the chaplains she drove, figuring
                            they were carrying enough baggage.” Mary and the chaplains went to the
                            ceremonies marking the end of the recovery work on May 30, 2002. She
                            recalls the silence of attendees gathered around the pit as the
                            bagpipers played ‘Taps.’ She saw a dove fly out of the pit and began
                            crying, but none of the people with her saw it. At the time, she didn’t
                            think it was really impacting her, she sees now that it did. In the
                            interview, she mentions that her husband left her, saying that she was
                            no longer the same person. She cries a lot more now, and thinks about
                            the families who were left behind, especially the children. She really
                            only talks to her family about her 9/11 experience. Mary doesn’t know if
                            she could do it again; she says that the impulse to help was “like a
                            tapping on the shoulder.” Mary doesn’t agree with the wars. She says
                            that people need to love one another and take care of each other. Mary
                            felt she was working for something much bigger than herself, and
                            believed that all the responders felt that way.

       William ‘Bill’ was born and raised in Bronx, N. Y. He met his wife in the
                            Bronx and in 1978 he moved out to Long Island and bought a home. He now
                            lives on LI near his three grown-up children and young grandchildren.
                            Bill joined the police department in 1973 and retired ten years ago
                            after nearly 33 years on the force and three promotions. In 1995, Bill
                            joined the NYPD Technical Assistance Response Unit (T.A.R.U.) and
                            commuted regularly to work from his home on eastern Long Island to the
                            NYPD T.A.R.U. Fort Totten precinct in Queens. The T.A.R.U. unit and is
                            comprised of a group of highly trained technical experts who assist in
                            retrieving information from electronic equipment, perform wiretapping,
                            lock-picking, and other technical aspects of surveillance operations.
                            The T.A.R.U. unit also collaborates with other NYPD units, such as the
                            Emergency Services Unit (E.S.U) and is involved in several types of
                            tasks. Many of these tasks require the processing of official legal
                            paperwork before they were carried out. In the T.A.R.U. unit, Bill
                            worked on grant writing and securing funding for training field
                            officers, and buying high-tech equipment for surveillance purposes.
                            Prior to joining the NYPD, Bill had several years of experience in the
                            railroad, as a firefighter and for 27 years he was a member of the Army
                            Reserves. On 9/11, Bill was working as a training officer in the NYPD
                            T.A.R.U. Fort Totten precinct, when he heard about a plane hitting the
                            WTC towers. When he heard about the second attack, he knew it was
                            terrorism. Several members of the Emergency Response Unit (ESU) in his
                            precinct were deployed to the WTC site and never returned. The T.A.R.U.
                            core group, consisting of Bill, his lieutenant, sergeant, and other
                            detectives drove a van containing all the necessary equipment
                            (batteries, gloves, boots, tapes, etc.) on the Long Island Expressway to
                            the WTC site. Bill remembers that the LIE was almost completely empty of
                            traffic. They parked by West Murray Street near the site, and Bill
                            started taking pictures of the burning towers. When the buildings
                            collapsed, Bill and his colleagues took shelter by a utility trailer
                            parked near the site. They were covered in thick, hot, and dusty debris
                            and had difficulty breathing. Bill and one his colleagues managed to
                            make their way out of the dust cloud into the North Cove Marina. Bill
                            remembers there was no communications except for his beeper sounding
                            off. His wife was trying to contact him. Their priority was to try to
                            get the communications system up and running. The NYPD set up a command
                            post in a phone company building near the site. Bill and other members
                            of the T.A.R.U. unit started documenting all the rescue and recovery
                            work at Ground Zero. They set up tiny cameras and microphones into
                            crevices in the pile wherever they thought there might be survivors.
                            This also helped them to retrieve items for DNA identification of
                            victims. They also set up a remote-controlled pan and tilt cameras in
                            various areas around the pile to monitor work activity. He recalls that
                            Goldman Sachs also requested the NYPD provide video surveillance on a
                            stash of $60 million dollars in gold bars they had in area. The T.A.R.U.
                            unit fulfilled a variety of job requests for the Police Commissioner’s
                            office, including taking aerial photos of the site and documenting
                            official events such as the President Bush’s official visit to the site
                            and family members’ commemoration services. He took several official
                            T.A.R.U. photos of the debris pile and the plane parts, which later
                            ended up as evidence against one of the masterminds of the 9/11 attacks,
                            Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. He also took the iconic photo of WTC responders
                            hoisting the first U.S. flag over Ground Zero. Bill remembers the
                            outpouring of charity in the forms of volunteers coming from all parts
                            of the U.S. to respond to the disaster. He remembers a cruise
                            boat—Spirit of St. Louis—that docked by the WTC site and provided free
                            meals to WTC responders. Actors such as the Baldwin brothers and Marisa
                            Tomei arrived at the site to boost morale and express their solidarity
                            and support. He remembers that there were times he need a break from
                            working at the site, and one day he took a break by walking on the beach
                            near his home on LI. He remembers the silence he heard at the beach was
                            in great contrast to the busy and noisy atmosphere at Ground Zero. Their
                            work had become automated and he observed that others were also working
                            like “ants” on the pile. He vividly describes how the intense heat on
                            the pile bent even the thickest steel girders, and the toxic air which
                            contributed to so many responders suffering from the chronic ‘WTC
                            cough.’

       Lawrence, “Larry”, was born in Queens, New York. He is the son of a New
                            York City firefighter and decided to become a firefighter when he
                            stopped by his father’s firehouse and saw the camaraderie that existed
                            between members. He took the FDNY entrance exam in 1979 and started
                            working in a Harlem firehouse. It was one of the toughest neighborhoods
                            to work in, and during this time he said that “Harlem was burning,”
                            which refers to the many landlords who were reportedly burning down
                            vacant and abandoned apartments, hoping to collect insurance money.
                            Larry felt that he learned quite a bit about firefighting being
                            stationed here, and as a probationary officer he encountered several
                            different types of fires. In 1991, Larry was promoted to Lieutenant and
                            left the Harlem firehouse. It was tough to leave since it was like a
                            second family. He moved around from firehouse to firehouse in various
                            boroughs in the city, and encountered several more types of fire
                            emergencies. Larry eventually landed in the Research and Development
                            wing of the FDNY, which was involved in making innovative firefighting
                            gear for FDNY members. The Research and Development quarters were
                            located in Greenpoint, Brooklyn and Larry worked with a great bunch of
                            guys. On 9/11, Larry got a call on the radio from the Special Operation
                            command about a plane attack on the WTC towers. He and four men from his
                            unit geared up, bringing emergency lights and rebar cutters with them.
                            They traveled through the incoming lane of the Midtown Tunnel since all
                            lanes were closed. They were able to get fairly close to the site,
                            parking at Church and Vesey Street. Larry didn’t know what to expect
                            since he had thought it was a small plane that hit the tower – until he
                            saw it. As soon as he opened the car door, he could feel the heat from
                            the building and saw the jumpers. They were making their way to the
                            command center when the building came down. He braced himself, and as a
                            religious man prayed a few Hail Marys. It got blacker and blacker, and
                            there was a lot of debris. They ran east of the buildings and survived
                            the first collapse – they could see the building "pancaking” and they
                            were not sure if would fall over or continue to fold inwards. They
                            managed to get masks from their car and made their way to the command
                            center. The Chief was suggesting they should form a line of men – but
                            then the second building came down. Larry was now by himself and the
                            lobby was filling up with dust, making it difficult to breathe. Larry
                            prayed the Our Father and Hail Mary many times, thinking about his kids
                            and waiting for the back draft of heat. As other survivors came in,
                            police officers and civilians, he shared his oxygen mask with them. He
                            couldn’t find his associate firefighters and thought the worst as he
                            called them on the radio. Finally he saw others who had taken refuge at
                            a church. They went down to the subway; dust was everywhere and they
                            were surprised and shocked to find people down there who didn’t know
                            what had happened. Things began to get more organized. There was a
                            temporary command post set up. They formed a perimeter around the site,
                            and started hearing reports that the White House and Pentagon had also
                            been hit. Larry found a shoe with a foot in it, and didn’t know what to
                            do with it. They made their way into a basement where they found a
                            lieutenant with a broken leg; they were able to get him on a stretcher
                            and to the dock where the wounded were being taken. Their eyes were
                            closing because of all the dust; they found a pool and dunked their
                            heads in the water, which relieved and revitalized them. They met up
                            with their boss who was in charge of search and rescue – he was in shock
                            and tried to give directions as best he could. Finally Larry got to call
                            his wife at home. She was ecstatic and relieved to know he was ok. He
                            hitched a ride with a couple back to Greenpoint. The next day he went
                            back to work at 6 A.M. A Texas fire company came and donated to the fire
                            house. Another donor provided a liquid additive so the water would cool
                            the steel beams quicker. Larry went to fifty or sixty funerals. This was
                            a difficult time for Larry, it was challenging to work without proper
                            management. It took about 2 months for things to settle down. His duty
                            as a firefighter kept him going, it’s in his blood. His 78 year old
                            father, a retired firefighter, also helped at the pile. Larry did seek
                            counseling at the fire department, which helped him to resurrect his
                            memories and file them back appropriately. He feels that God has given
                            him a new lease on life. He was recognized by FDNY for his creation of
                            the “Radio Project”, which enables fire fighters to communicate during
                            fires. During this time, neighbors contributed tools, shovels, eye
                            wipes, and cooked meals – everyone’s generosity and charity was evident.
                            When Larry went to the 9/11 First Responder Tribute, people were
                            clapping and cheering for them. Larry has taken the advice of a
                            counselor he saw – on the anniversary he has created a routine where he
                            attends church and spends time at Eisenhower Park. He feels it is time
                            to move on; not to forget but to move forward. He feels the Oral History
                            Project is a great way to pay tribute to the 9/11 efforts as it is a
                            part of history and he is happy to be a part of it. Larry does not think
                            of himself as a hero, he did what he was trained to do – other people
                            are the heroes if they are fearless. He worked as a fire fighter for
                            over 27 years and did not want to leave. “The WTC Program takes good
                            care of me.” Currently Larry owns a family restaurant. The kids help out
                            a lot and he gets to spend time with his son, who is 12 years old. He
                            doesn’t know if his son will be a fire fighter; his two older daughters
                            are in college. He still keeps in touch with other fire fighters, he has
                            their company. He has some trouble going into Manhattan. He says, “My
                            father brings me through.” Larry’s closing comments were, “Even the
                            worst of times brings the good out in people.”

       Bill was employed as structural ironworker for New York City at the time
                            of 9/11. He started work as an ironworker at 18, after he took an
                            apprenticeship test and came in 7th place on the roster. Two weeks later
                            he started working on top a building. He worked on a number of buildings
                            near Battery Park by the WTC site. He began working for the city because
                            it provided steady work and income, and he joined the Local Ironworkers
                            Union 361 located in Brooklyn, New York. Bill has a younger brother and
                            older sister. His father was a New York City sanitation worker and his
                            mother was a nurse. On 9/11, Bill’s headquarters was located in
                            Brooklyn, near the Williamsburg Bridge. They were in direct view of the
                            WTC towers. That morning, he came out of the building and saw that the
                            first WTC tower was on fire from a plane attack. Most people thought it
                            was a small plane. Then, Bill saw another plane aim for the second
                            tower. Ten seconds later he felt the aftershock of the blast. They heard
                            over the radio that the Pentagon had also been attacked. Bill remembers
                            that people were in shock; one guy just “sort of freaked out.” He
                            watched as debris came out of the buildings and felt that the towers
                            were going to come down when the fire melted the steel beams. The towers
                            came down, and Bill first thought about his family. He drove his
                            motorcycle and went back home to his ex-wife and cried a little but then
                            felt he had to go back and help out in some way. He tried to drive back
                            to his headquarters in Brooklyn but the city had virtually shut down, so
                            he had to show his city employee badge to a state trooper in order to
                            continue driving into the city limits. Bill went to his headquarters and
                            got some equipment onto a big boom truck and drove over the FDR Bridge
                            into the city. He came into Lower Manhattan by West Street and noticed
                            the thick powder and paper covering everything. He said that it reminded
                            him of snow on a winter night. There were cars on fire nearby and he saw
                            a set of one of the plane’s wheels on West Street. It did not take long
                            before it became difficult to breathe. As an ironworker, he was used to
                            working with a respirator of some sort, and even then, he had to
                            sometimes take it off because it would become too hot to wear it and
                            work optimally. Bill remembers seeing firefighters on the pile working
                            on the Bucket Brigade and digging out debris by hand. He remembers
                            seeing only dust, twisted steel, electrical wires. All the computers,
                            chairs, and desks were pulverized in the collapse. Bill knew he had to
                            help out somehow. By working at the pile, Bill ran into some ironworkers
                            that he had not seen in quite a while. He remembers that the
                            firefighters were glad that the ironworkers were there as they provided
                            the “know-how” and equipment to remove debris from the pile. Eventually,
                            the city divided the pile up into 4 sections and hired contractors to
                            work each section. Bill was already on the NYC payroll, but he saw some
                            things he did not like—for example—he related a situation in which
                            people were paid by two different contractors for working on the pile.
                            He also related examples of generosity, where people were donating
                            supplies and equipment to workers at the site. Bill worked 4-5 hours
                            days on the pile for about 2 months. At one point, he was assigned to
                            the Vessey Street subway station which was severely damaged during the
                            attacks. He had to wield the steel gates shut, so that no one would
                            enter the station. Bill felt the work he did at the site was natural to
                            him. He mainly worked on cutting steel, using standard ironworker
                            equipment such as blowtorches. Bill’s experience as a responder left him
                            “a little traumatized.” He suffers from PTSD. After the attacks,
                            whenever he heard a jet go by overhead, he thought it might be coming
                            for him. In 2007, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. This illness
                            changed the way he looked at life. He now sees life as “very precious,
                            and very short.” He is spiritual person and believes that there is “as
                            much good as there is evil in this world.”

       Meta worked as a VP in communications for a Business and Development
                            company. The day before 9/11, she had headed to Atlantic City for a big
                            conference that she had organized for her job. She remembers that it was
                            cloudy that day, but low clouds and she could see the tops of the towers
                            and the Statue of Liberty on her way to NJ. She said they were like
                            cotton balls in the sky. On the morning of the 11th, she was in a
                            conference room during orientation with many people that she knew. There
                            was no TV in the room but word was trickling in about the disaster and
                            so she and another colleague went out into the casino and headed to her
                            room to put on a TV just in time to see the 2nd plane hit. She was
                            frozen, felt helpless, and didn’t know what to do. She remembered that
                            her mother had planned on going to NY on that day so she was very
                            concerned about that. Meta’s office is located behind the Empire State
                            Building and she contacted her colleagues and told them to leave and go
                            home. Meanwhile, at the conference, there were people from NYC,
                            Brooklyn, New Jersey and many other locations. The conference quickly
                            broke up and people began to make plans. Meta heard about the Pentagon
                            attack and PA but didn’t know how bad it was. Again, she just felt
                            helpless. Meta stated that when the towers fell, it was like a part of
                            her fell also; they were her beacon, her anchor. The casino became a
                            ghost town and people were wandering the beach, stunned and
                            disconnected. She left the casino, went outside, found a church and
                            prayed. The next day she checked out. She logged her speed at 90mph, and
                            there were only 2-3 other cars on the parkway. When she got to the toll
                            gates, they were up. Like the other cars in front of her, she hesitated
                            and then gunned it. The enormity of what happened was starting to hit
                            her. It had been such a beautiful day, how could something so
                            devastating have happened? She just wanted to get home. By the time she
                            hit the Staten Island freeway, traffic was bumper to bumper. It took her
                            8 hours to get from Atlantic City to Roosevelt, 4 of those hours were
                            spent sitting on the bridge. She can still see the plumes and spaces
                            where the buildings stood; sitting on a bed of clouds – now gone. She
                            rolled up her windows and put the air on. It was a bitter taste and bad
                            smell. She got home and found her mom was ok. On the 13th, Meta took the
                            train to her office. She hadn’t slept much the night before. She said
                            that people were walking around as if nothing happened. There was an
                            acrid taste in her mouth and a smell in the air. She was filled with
                            sadness. She spent most of the day organizing clients and where they
                            would go. She walked from the train station to Canal Street. She could
                            see the burning buildings, the barricades, and masses of people
                            everywhere. She crawled under a barricade and offered her help. She was
                            put to work right away putting bottled water on ice. She also helped at
                            tables handing out socks, gloves, or whatever was needed. At one point
                            she was asked to take care of a German Shepherd that needed a break from
                            being on the pile. She was asked to just hold him and rub his head while
                            someone cleaned his feet and cleared his eyes. This was her city and she
                            wanted to be there. She felt guilty that on the first day of the
                            disaster, she was stuck in Atlantic City. There were signs of missing
                            people hung everywhere. It was a bright, sunny day but that smell was in
                            the air. New Yorkers are resilient; she wasn’t afraid. At one point she
                            even handed the Governor bottled water. She was part of a supportive
                            bunch that covered a large area. She worked 9-4 at her regular job every
                            day and then went to Ground Zero to volunteer. She never told her family
                            or friends what she was doing, even though she came from a family of
                            service workers. Meta saw the positive aspects in human beings. She felt
                            no anger, just eagerness to help people. When someone was found,
                            everything stopped and a caravan led the way with whatever was found.
                            She remembered at one point a large, long piece of shiny silver was
                            recovered. She realized it was fire truck that had been burned and
                            flattened. She recalls the first time she saw the pile close up, it was
                            huge and overwhelming. After a while she got used to the smell. When the
                            ironworkers came in, she knew it had gone from rescue to recovery mode.
                            Meta remembers Regis Philbin doing a story on the site. He was in the
                            area with his crew filming and Meta was in a few of the background
                            shots. It wasn’t until this was shown on TV that Meta’s friends saw her
                            and questioned her. She then told them that she had been spending all
                            her free time volunteering at the site. Later Meta helped out at Trinity
                            Church assisting families of survivors. It wasn’t until around the third
                            week in October that she stopped volunteering. Around Christmas she
                            realized the enormity of it all. Meta was born on Christmas. She was
                            watching a movie on TV and the towers were shown...this really got to
                            her. She continued to work her regular job all this time and says she
                            got her strength from faith, family, and friends. She had strong role
                            models. At night she would go to St. Patrick’s at night to light candles
                            and she also began to keep a diary. She currently works with the Hands
                            of Hope organization and interacts with families daily helping in any
                            way she can. Meta stated that at one time, her company was going to take
                            space in Tower 1. Because she is afraid of heights and due to some
                            logistical issues, they decided to take space elsewhere. If it weren’t
                            for that, chances are pretty good that Meta would have been in the tower
                            when they fell. She has survivor guilt over this. After the first
                            anniversary, Meta didn’t want to get out of bed. She doesn’t do well in
                            elevators or bridges, has panic attacks easily, and cries at the drop of
                            a hat. She recently visited the 9/11 Memorial in NYC and said that she
                            didn’t really approve of the way that it was done. She thought it should
                            have been kept as a sacred place; a place for healing and reflection.
                            Looking back, she knows that life can change in a second. She is more
                            attuned to the needs of others. She will always remember the smell and
                            the burned fire truck. She’ll never forget the community spirit,
                            everyone coming together to help. Each person has something to
                            contribute and they should never feel limited. Meta says she tries to
                            focus on people doing good things. She says, "Make your ripple a
                            positive ripple on that pond of life."

       Peter, his wife and five children had just gotten back from vacation. His
                            wife was a nursing supervisor working the midnight shift and arrived
                            home at 8:00 a.m. He got a phone call from his wife’s friend who told
                            them about the attacks. He switched the television from Nickelodeon to
                            CNN to see the plane attacks. He was still on vacation, so his beeper
                            was not working. Peter is in the ESU unit of the NYC Corrections
                            Department and the National Guard, so he called the National Guard for
                            additional information. He knew at this point that he would be going
                            into the city, and from watching the news he knew the towers would fall.
                            When the plane hit the Pentagon, he called the Armory and was activated.
                            He had to pick up his children at school, and they were a little
                            baffled. He dropped them off at home, packed an overnight kit, kissed
                            his family good bye and headed to the Armory on Lexington Avenue in
                            Bayshore. Many people in the Guard are cops, fireman, and medical
                            personnel. They sat around and waited until the evening of 9/11 as other
                            companies arrived and got organized. He was assigned to drive the
                            company commanding officer to the Southwest Quadrant of the site.
                            Arriving at the site, he remembers seeing the dust and the paper; the
                            dust came through the Humvee’s canvas doors. They established a
                            perimeter and worked on the bucket brigade. Looking at the whole area
                            was apocalyptic. He did reconnaissance – he focused on his job of trying
                            to find people and this helped him not become overwhelmed. While they
                            worked on the pile, they would hear sirens to warn the responders of
                            collapsing debris. He wore a paper mask daily at first, and later on he
                            got the respirator mask. A lot of the younger guardsmen forgot to bring
                            extra clothing and supplies, so Peter ended up organizing this for them.
                            He worked at the pile for 12 hour shifts and went back to the Armory for
                            rest. He stayed in the armory for a week until he was relieved by the
                            101st Calvary from upstate New York. He had a very tough day at the site
                            when he received a letter from a young lady named Christine Garcia,
                            which made him a bit emotional. Peter released stress by talking to his
                            colleagues as he tried to “keep everybody’s spirits up.” He found it to
                            be very helpful to be within a platoon. On the pile, he was able to walk
                            around to see people that he knew; when he ran into somebody he knew he
                            was elated. He met several of his correction officer colleagues: "It
                            felt so good to see people that you know.” He found out later that two
                            firefighter friends of his had died during the attacks. Peter was
                            sitting at the Humvee, resting by the inside perimeter when two
                            detectives came up with a big U.S. flag for them. A rabbi from the
                            National Guard said a prayer and they walked up 60 flights of stairs to
                            hang the flag by a building . A week after 9/11, Peter took the Humvee
                            to the Bayshore post. He went home and “tried to decompress a little
                            bit.” Peter’s wife was very helpful; he spoke to her about the events
                            that may be coming their way. She also made him an album of all his WTC
                            experiences. He took Wednesday off. Thursday he reported to ESU and with
                            the corrections unit reported again to the WTC. They kept a rapid
                            response team on Rikers Island, and officers were stationed to guard the
                            bridge. He felt obligated to be down there. On Thursday, they first went
                            to the Stuyvescent High School staging area and took turns in shifts to
                            go down to the WTC site. He transported responders who were injured to
                            the hospital by a gator. They worked 12 hour shifts, 5 to 6 days a week;
                            sometimes at HQ and sometimes posted to security on bridges but mostly
                            on the pile working with their hands sorting through dust piles for body
                            parts. There were people cheering him on, handing out water bottles. He
                            worked this way until February, 2002. Peter lost a medic in his unit
                            named Tommy. Tommy’s oldest son was in the Army and was stationed in
                            Iraq. His younger son went to Afghanistan as a part of the Marines.
                            Peter closed his interview by saying, “Life is short – don’t sweat the
                            small stuff.”

       Joseph was the Chief of St. James Fire Department on 9/11. He had the day
                            off and was scheduled to go to Wisconsin to view a new fire truck. He
                            was at LaGuardia Airport but the flight was cancelled due to the attack.
                            Joseph noticed a tremendous plume of black smoke from the city while he
                            was on the plane at LaGuardia. They evacuated and closed the airport.
                            Joseph’s daughters were 2 and 5 at the time. He wanted to get home to
                            let them know he was ok. Nassau and Suffolk County firefighters were
                            relocated to Queens (Engine 314 by JFK) to cover the firehouse since all
                            their firefighters were in the city. They were also supplied with
                            additional resources. Joseph opened up their Emergency Operations Center
                            to coordinate with NYC Fire Departments. He went into the city on Friday
                            as part of Emergency Management and coordinated resources for the Fire
                            Department. Joseph recalls that the traffic was quite heavy that
                            morning. They set up a temporary HQ at the 19th Street Police Academy.
                            Joseph described it as "organized chaos - people were just doing what
                            they had to do." They had training on how to handle emergency
                            situations; to be able to focus on the tasks at hand and get things
                            accomplished. Then they worked at Temporary OEM at Pier 96. Joseph was
                            very much involved in the coordination of resources – communications
                            with NYC FD and OEM. Joseph wanted to go down to the site to see his
                            partner, who was working there. They took their county vehicle to One
                            Police Plaza by the World Trade Center, and parked and walked up to the
                            site. Everything was covered in dust, even the walls. Two weeks prior,
                            Joseph had been to the World Trade Center to addend a conference; one
                            session was about 'Aviation Disasters in NYC.' The building was now a
                            pile of rubble and firefighters were still putting out the fires on the
                            pile. Joseph wanted to be on the pile helping the firefighters but he
                            was more involved getting materials to help them – such as milling for
                            the road,”situating cranes, and providing repairmen for machines that
                            needed reconstruction. They had people from across the country offering
                            resources. Joseph was there for 6 weeks, working 12 hour days, 7 days a
                            week. He remembers that they had some school children who put up banners
                            of support by the site. His family was very supportive and his wife made
                            sure everything was running smoothly. Since 9/11 Joseph has become more
                            cognizant of what is going on. He has learned how “fragile life is, how
                            short it can be.” “Everybody set their differences aside, and it helped
                            pull all of us together. All gave some, some gave all.”

       Patrick was raised in the Bronx. After he got married, he moved to
                            Lynbrook, Long Island. He has grown children. He was an ironworker for
                            Local 580, but has been on disability and has had numerous surgeries on
                            his foot and lungs since 2003. On the morning of 9/11, he was getting a
                            haircut in the neighborhood when he heard of the attacks. It was a
                            clear, beautiful day. He initially thought it was an accident and he
                            could see smoke coming out of the building and then saw the 2nd plane
                            hit the South Tower. People in the barbershop were running around
                            nervously and Patrick recalls that the barber almost cut his throat
                            shaving him. He went home that night in shock and just sat on the edge
                            of his bed thinking of the horror. On Sept. 12, he went to North Bergen
                            to donate blood for survivors. He then took public transportation to his
                            NYC union and waited for permission to go to the disaster site and help.
                            On Thursday, he went back to the city with 15 other volunteers with
                            picks and shovels. They got as far as 14th Street when they were stopped
                            by police, so he went back to his union hall. They sent him to the Jacob
                            Javits Center where he had to show his license to burn steel to get
                            clearance. Finally, by Friday of that week, he got permission and took a
                            bus to the area. He said it was just shock and horror. There were 12-15
                            floors of mangled steel and stuff flying around everywhere. There were
                            thousands of people in those buildings and now they were gone. He
                            remembers seeing a pile of shoes that had been gathered from all over.
                            There were hundreds of shoes --some bloody, some burned, all empty. All
                            those people were gone. When shoes were found anywhere in the area, they
                            were added to a huge pile to help in identification later. The image of
                            the shoes came up several times in the interview. Patrick also made of
                            point of saying that the buildings were filled with books, desks, light
                            bulbs, dust, bathrooms, lamps, and concrete. Everything was pulverized
                            and the dust from it all was in his lungs. He recalls seeing dogs
                            walking around the pile and buckets being passed down long lines.
                            Everyone worked together; it was organized and coordinated as much as it
                            could be. All the iron workers from the city came in on that Friday.

       On 9/11 Tom was employed by Northeast Steel as a welder with heavy
                            equipment. He was at home on Long Island to celebrate his wedding
                            anniversary when a neighbor called him to turn on the TV. The first
                            tower was on fire and then he watched the plane hit the second tower. He
                            wanted to be there to help. He was so worried and agitated that he
                            cancelled the plans to celebrate his anniversary and went to the city
                            with his neighbor’s friend, who was going to work. He wore a grey shirt
                            with “ENGINEERING” written on it and carried his yellow hard hat. They
                            took the train from Ronkonkoma to Penn Station. Tom had no prior
                            experience in disaster work, but his shirt and yellow hat got them
                            through several roadblocks as they walked down the Westside Highway. His
                            friend left for work and Tom then made his way down to the American
                            Express Building. There was “fine, grey dust everywhere” and he felt
                            like he was "the last person on earth.” A Red Cross ambulance needed a
                            light fixed, so he did that and then started helping load and unload
                            supplies. The Red Cross was stationed at the corner of Vesey St. and the
                            Westside Highway. Tom remembers the constant flow of ash, heat, and a
                            lack of sound. The Red Cross needed more space and started constructing
                            a makeshift room by the school. Tom helped out by recruiting volunteers.
                            They split the room in half and laid out medical supplies and equipment.
                            A medical specialist named BJ took control of things. Policemen and
                            firemen were among the volunteers. BJ sent them to Modell’s Department
                            store nearby for shoes and socks plus other supplies. The manager
                            donated all of it to the cause. Tom was there three days, transporting
                            supplies and volunteers to and from the pile. A doctor volunteer
                            mentioned a number of good deeds done by all and felt that Tom was like
                            his own son. Tom stayed to work on the pile then and said of it,
                            “Everybody looked the same, grey”. One day Tom found a body part on the
                            pile. He decided to take some time off. When Tom got home that day he
                            told his wife he intended to work for a construction company and a
                            company of union guys. They cried and had dinner together. Tom then got
                            all of his welding equipment together and kissed the family good bye. He
                            worked on the pile cutting steel and filling up the dump trucks for 8 to
                            12 hours a day with a group of day laborers. Tom remembers many
                            onlookers lined up the street cheering and clapping for the responders.
                            That work continued for about eight weeks and the site started to become
                            more ordered and controlled. They had water, food, provisions, and cell
                            phones from Verizon donated. He was then able to call his wife and keep
                            in touch. He went on to work on Building Seven and the pile. All the
                            while he had blisters all over his hands. Throughout the ten months Tom
                            was there he met “amazing people.” There was BJ, the young doctor,
                            ironworker Pat, and Al. Tom felt that “there was a reason to be there”
                            and “the hardest part of the job was leaving there.” On June 10, Tom
                            fell down an elevator shaft and broke his back. Tom felt that it was
                            “actually the first time in my life that my training meant something.”
                            Tom was in bed for months. He developed bronchitis and lung disease. He
                            gained eighty pounds due to the steroid medication he was taking. He
                            said “working is part of who I am” and felt ashamed he had no job. Tom
                            was out of work for five years and then lost his medical benefits. This
                            has greatly affected his family. Tom would still have gone today, even
                            knowing all the health complications from being on the site. He is proud
                            as he looks down his street and sees an American flag on every house. He
                            was asked to join the FealGood Foundation and helps out when he can. He
                            is also in the ‘Heroes Helping Heroes’ program. Tom asks, “Why can’t our
                            government take care of those who help us?" He tried to get a bill
                            passed to help injured construction workers, but that fell through
                            because it was too straightforward and simple. He has been to Washington
                            twenty five times and saw the government “in action.” He says “even the
                            little people make a difference.”

       Michael was born and raised in Bayside, Queens. A lifelong New Yorker, he
                            has always loved NY. He’s a physician specializing in internal medicine
                            and geriatrics, and is married with a daughter, born exactly ten years
                            after 9/11. Growing up in the 70's in Bayside, it was a different world.
                            It was a great childhood. His family is from Greece and they would spend
                            summers there. At the time of 9/11, he was still single and getting
                            ready to start his own practice. That morning, his brother called to
                            tell him what was happening, and he met up with him and they watched the
                            events unfold on TV. Michael felt panicked; they got in the car and
                            headed toward Long Island City. They saw huge lines of people evacuating
                            on foot via the bridges from Manhattan. Police were already closing the
                            streets, so they turned back. As they did, they heard a call on the
                            radio for doctors and medical personnel to report to local precincts. He
                            figured that if he went and his brother didn’t, then at least one of
                            them would survive if something more happened. Michael reported to the
                            111th precinct and was put into a room with others. He was transported
                            to Shea Stadium with an EMT named Charlie. The stadium lot was filled
                            with fire trucks, police vehicles, and more. A DEA agent escorted them
                            into the city; it was deserted. Michael recalls that he was wearing his
                            lab coat; both of them had brought medical supplies. They were directed
                            toward Stuyvesant high school on foot, and Michael noticed the half-foot
                            of dust on the street and the smell in the air. “I couldn’t believe the
                            destruction I saw.” They were some of the first medical personal to
                            arrive at the school, and the scene was chaotic. With other medical
                            staff, they set up three different triage zones: for medicine, light
                            surgical issues, and major surgical problems—those needing more care
                            would be routed to St. Vincent’s Hospital. At that time, they didn’t
                            know there really wouldn’t be survivors coming in. When they realized
                            people weren’t coming, they set out into the area for hours, looking for
                            survivors who needed medical attention. They treated responders with
                            minor injuries, irrigated their eyes. It felt like they “were in Dante’s
                            Inferno.” Michael recalls trying to make firefighters battling fires
                            leave the area for their safety. Michael had participated in mock
                            disaster drills, but had never responded to a real large scale disaster.
                            He was near Building 7 went it collapsed, and they ran into a nearby
                            building. He didn’t know what was going to happen, and said “God, if
                            you’re going to take me, just take me now.” Eventually they made it back
                            to Stuyvesant that day, and went back out a few times. While at the
                            school, they rested in shifts, shared food, and continued to treat the
                            responders who came in. ultimately, Michael was there for about 36 hours
                            straight. At one point, a firefighter with a bone sticking out of his
                            leg came in to be treated, and refused to be taken to the hospital,
                            saying he wouldn’t leave his brothers. He asked to be patched up and
                            sent back out, and the next thing Michael knew, he had left with the
                            colleagues who brought him in. Michael never knew what became of him.
                            Michael caught a ride back to Queens with an undercover cop. Once home,
                            he took a long shower, ate, spoke with his brother, and then went to bed
                            for about 14 hours. He wanted to go back, but the reports made it seem
                            like there was no need. Michael and Charlie would meet occasionally for
                            a few years after, but then they lost touch. Michael talked about the
                            trust he felt with Charlie on that day. He does feel like he’s more
                            detached from the event now, given the passage of time and healing that
                            has occurred. When talking about how it affected people in a positive
                            way, he said, “Sometimes out of these tragic events, goodness comes out
                            like a flood.” That day, he saw people coming together from all walks of
                            life. He tries to be more tolerant now—after this experience, he learned
                            that life is truly fleeting. Michael believes it’s important to give
                            back, and he’s continued to donate his medical services in various ways.
                            He also collected supplies to be sent to Haiti after the earthquake.
                            Michael says that continuing to find ways to help others helped him heal
                            emotionally. His life has changed dramatically in the 10 years after
                            9/11. Michael also talked about the lessons he’d like to pass to his
                            daughter.

       Timothy grew up in Jamaica, Queens. He attended a Catholic high school,
                            then college, and while there he joined the Coast Guard Reserves where
                            he performed various rescue operations. He graduated from college with a
                            teaching degree and then joined the police academy where he was
                            stationed in the old 41st precinct in the Bronx as patrol officer. His
                            career took him into narcotics and soon he was promoted to detective.
                            Four years later he married and now has three children. The family
                            settled in Nassau County on Long Island. Tim is the youngest of five
                            siblings. One elder brother, Jack, is with the NYPD transit police. Tim
                            has always liked helping people. He was good at following orders and had
                            many good leaders that helped him throughout his life. On 9/11, Tim was
                            working in the Brooklyn North narcotics division as a detective assigned
                            to a team investigating local areas for narcotics based on complaints by
                            the citizens. He took the Long Island Rail Road into Penn Station that
                            morning, and walked over to Federal Plaza to attend his class. The agent
                            in charge of the class came in and announced that the class was
                            cancelled and for them to return to their command or go down to the
                            World Trade Center to help out with the disaster. A marathon runner, Tim
                            ran to the site to help out. Tim had dressed in a suit that day and as
                            he approached Church and Vesey Streets, he asked a Port Authority cop
                            directing traffic where all the police officers were meeting up. It was
                            like a “battlefield.” There were all kinds of debris falling, “Some of
                            it was people." He went into the WTC Plaza and the second plane hit.
                            Shards of glass and airplane parts were raining down with the debris. He
                            managed to get some tools from other police and joined their band of
                            officers. He used a coffee table as an umbrella. They climbed to the
                            twentieth floor of the North Tower, tried to calm the people evacuating,
                            took his tie off, and met a team of firefighters. They were helping them
                            to adjust their masks as the South Tower imploded. The dust and debris
                            was blown up the stairs and then the lieutenant present got a radio call
                            to get out of the tower. At the bottom they all dispersed as the North
                            Tower came down. He mentioned there was, “A sea of debris and ash behind
                            me.” Tim did not have a mask, so he breathed into his armpit. He was
                            worried about secondary devices exploding. The lieutenant was injured so
                            Tim took him to the hospital. At some point, he also met with Mayor
                            Giuliani, who thanked him for his efforts. Tim believed that good
                            leadership was very, very important, for without it they would not be
                            alive. He was hot and covered in soot so he decided to go back to the
                            police academy and take a shower and “deloused.” He was interviewed by a
                            few cops who were interviewing everyone who had been down there. He got
                            a ride home to his wife, who cried when they were reunited. Tim took 30
                            days off and went to the doctor, who diagnosed him with partial airway
                            obstruction. He decided to return to the site and did escorts to Ground
                            Zero. He worked on the pile and found bones and body parts in the
                            rubble. In March of 2002 he started breaking down and was told by his
                            sergeant to go take care of himself. Tim decided to return to active
                            duty in the Coast Guard. He turned in his guns and retired from the
                            police department. He was stationed at Sandy Hook, New Jersey. This move
                            produced a smaller salary and put a financial burden on the family.
                            After a month with the Coast Guard, Tim felt guilty and wanted to help
                            out more. He volunteered to do escorts at Ground Zero and also worked at
                            the landfill, and at the same time he worked his regular shift with the
                            US Coast Guard. He remembers the smell of burned ash and bodies at the
                            site. After two years, Tim’s health was still not right. He had more
                            tests and they found high levels of heavy metals in his bloodstream. He
                            started having seizures and had to retire from the Coast Guard. He is
                            now under the care of a neurologist at Long Island Jewish hospital.
                            Tim’s wife and family are a good source of support and he gets help
                            through medical facilities. He is more spiritual now in his retirement.
                            He tries to stay busy and be helpful to the family but every day is not
                            perfect. He tries to “show up and suit up.” Tim volunteers with religion
                            class at his kids’ school. He goes over with them what it is to be alive
                            and focuses on acts of kindness while remembering all that he is
                            thankful for. Every anniversary of 9/11 Tim goes back for the memorial
                            service. He participates in 9/11 projects, such as this one. He believes
                            that “God has a mission for all of us,” and for him to be a good father
                            and husband is important. He feels disconnected from work and a social
                            life, but he still has the feeling that “I want to give more than I
                            receive.” Asked how he would respond to 9/11 if it occurred again, he
                            said he would probably think about it first. He does not want to think
                            of that situation now that he is retired from the police department and
                            the Coast Guard. His reaction may not be the same. He says “I want to
                            grow old with my wife and kids, one day at a time.”

       James is a retired police officer from Brooklyn. He's originally from
                            Queens. He was an NYPD patrol officer in the 107th precinct, which
                            covered Jamaica, Flushing, and Queens Village. He enjoyed the many
                            details that he went on from 1984 through June of 2003, a total of
                            nineteen and a half years. James recalled that 9/11 was an election day.
                            He was with his partner in the patrol car working the 7am to 3:30pm
                            shift. They heard about the attack of the radio in the car. A number of
                            men jumped into a van and headed for Manhattan. At first he thought it
                            was a disaster drill, but they saw the second plane and knew it was the
                            real thing. He and his partner, Evan,drove into the city and as they
                            approached the first tower collapsed. One of the patrolmen was very
                            upset as he knew his brother was in the building. As the second plane
                            crashed into the second tower, people came to them and kept asking
                            questions. James and the other cops them to get out of the area. James
                            felt numb as he heard each floor crash and said, “It didn’t really sink
                            in.” His patrol wound up at Church and Vesey Streets, where Building 7
                            and surrounding buildings were on fire. When they got to the assigned
                            post, firefighters were at each building furiously fighting the fires.
                            James’ patrol unit put in a full day of work from 9am that day until 1am
                            the next morning. They were assigned to secure the perimeter of the area
                            and to keep people out of danger. His memories of that night were of
                            snowy dust everywhere; there was devastation all around them. He recalls
                            a policewoman screaming in to the city wide radio frequency and then
                            there was silence. He managed to drive home, and the next day, James
                            worked at his precinct a while and then volunteered to go back to the
                            site and work on the bucket brigade with follow policemen. The firemen
                            had a line and the policemen had a line responsible for removing debris
                            on the “Bucket Brigade.” There was a great sense of respect between the
                            two forces working side by side. They used this method for removal
                            because the many stories of the building pile prohibited removal by
                            heavy machinery. James recalled looking down from the top of the broken
                            dome of the Winter Garden Theatre atrium through the five stories
                            underneath. He described the scene as “controlled chaos.” Close by there
                            was a cruise ship set up where volunteers were designated to distribute
                            boots and gloves, and Outback Steakhouse was serving food. James said,
                            “It was nice to get a hot meal and sit down for a few minutes.” James
                            volunteered intermittently for about a year. At first, on the pile, they
                            were issued only a paper masks, but respirators were there for the men
                            soon. After three times on the pile, James was assigned security at the
                            Westside highway, the Lincoln Tunnel, and the pier. James has not talked
                            with his family about this experience; however he was honored in his
                            son’s class at school for his work. His kids were too young at the time
                            to realize the enormity of what had happened. In the time after 9/11,
                            James was working twelve hour shifts, seven days a week, and hardly
                            home. He also avoided discussing things with his coworkers. He still
                            remembers the sound of the firemen’s Scott packs. Once while eating at
                            McDonald’s, the sound of their fryers reminded him of the Scott packs
                            and he had to leave. He has become a bit more spiritual and appreciates
                            life more. James’ values come from his father, who was a police officer.
                            He was told that volunteering was “the right thing to do.” James does
                            not believe that he is a hero; he was just doing his job. James wonders
                            how people in the rest of the country remember 9/11. He wants viewers of
                            his interview to remember in these final words, “Just don’t
                            forget--don’t forget all the people that we lost.”

       Neil, 44, grew up in Astoria, Queens and now lives on Long Island. He
                            comes from a large family, as does his wife. Together, they have four
                            children. Both sides are from Queens and Brooklyn. Neil was mentored by
                            his father and started out in a marketing career. He was later
                            encouraged by his sister’s friend to join the NYPD, and started the
                            academy in 1993. He was assigned to Chelsea at Seventh Avenue and
                            Westside Highway. He made an abundance of friends and one of them
                            recommended that he should join the NYPD Organized Crime Bureau. The
                            city is a “melting pot”, and the experience he has had has made him
                            grow. He has had many challenges and unexpected obstacles in this line
                            of work. Neil worked as an undercover cop in narcotics and dealt with
                            “the beast” personally in his work. He did what nobody else wanted to
                            do. Police officers are “not made of cast iron” but also cannot take
                            things (bad experiences) home with them. There is a “safety net” with
                            other police officers away from their social life where they can develop
                            a dry sense of humor due to their type of work. Neil was planning to
                            work a double shift on 9/11. He had to be in court at 100 Centre Street,
                            which was just blocks away from the World Trade Center, to testify on a
                            case that morning. He rode the E- train to Penn Station and emerged at
                            Chambers Street at 8:41 in the morning. He reported in to his supervisor
                            and sat down with his newspaper and coffee. He looked in the direction
                            of the towers and saw the “blimp” of the first airplane and continued to
                            watch in disbelief as it hit the tower. He perceived it as a very
                            serious accident. Neil approached a street vendor, identified himself,
                            and gave him a list of contacts at his job. He asked the vendor to
                            contact all on the list if he did not return. He walked to the foot of
                            the North Tower and called his sister. He told her that he loved her and
                            the family, and then does not remember exactly what happened. As he
                            entered the tower, he saw many injured people and helped a number of
                            them out toward the Westside Highway. He felt the impact of the second
                            plane as it hit the South Tower. There were shards of metal slicing the
                            air as they fell. Bodies were falling too. Neil felt helpless, as there
                            was nothing he could do for any of them. Neil’s wife was pregnant and,
                            upon hearing where he was, went into pre-labor. Meanwhile, he was in a
                            fight or flight moment as he heard screams of people and rumors of other
                            plane attacks. Neil just kept helping people out of the building,
                            including one very heavy man that he carried out on his shoulder. Neil
                            mused, “He must‘ve been at least 300 pounds.” Most of his memories of
                            this time are starting to fade. The South Tower started to collapse and
                            he heard distress calls from the firefighters. He took a picture of his
                            daughter from his wallet and worried as he watched rescuers still going
                            into the North Tower. They never came back out. Neil thought that this
                            was the end for him. He rushed one more gentleman out of the building,
                            turned to go back in, and then decided not to. Then the North Tower
                            collapsed and the wind force blew him a few yards away. He hid in a box
                            truck that was shelter for several other people. He could feel their
                            breath. His heart was pounding. The people turned to him and asked if he
                            was burned, but what they thought were burns turned out not to be his
                            skin, but the skin of other people that had rubbed off on him. A
                            firefighter took him for a pair of boots and triage at a station. He
                            then walked out toward the American Express building and decided that he
                            could not go back. Neil found a police friend, Anthony and they
                            commandeered a taxi cab to take them to their precinct, where they
                            observed a great sense of urgency and fellow cops in riot gear. During
                            the following days people from his precinct were stationed by the
                            American Express building and were working in shifts on the pile. As
                            they worked, there were the sounds of horns signaling the possible
                            unsteadiness and collapse of the buildings in the area they were working
                            on. When the horns sounded, they had to leave the pile until they were
                            assured that it was safe to return. Neil worked on the pile for several
                            weeks in addition to his to his regular hours. He was feeling most
                            inspired when he saw the sun shining on the Statue of Liberty in the
                            early morning hours as he worked at the site. He was pleased later when
                            he saw a picture of himself working on the bucket brigade. It was taken
                            by an amateur photographer for the 'Here is New York' exhibit. Neil
                            continued to be inspired as he worked on the pile with his fellow men.
                            They were the people behind him, in front of him, and next to him
                            working unselfishly on the pile. After those days of 9/11 intensity, he
                            needed a bit of normalcy in his life. Spending time with his friends,
                            and the touch of his mother’s hand kept him feeling human. Neil still
                            made a point to spend time at the site, sometimes with his
                            brother-in-law, who was also a police officer. He remembers the
                            appreciation given to him by civilians. They hugged him in gratitude and
                            he thought it was nice to have their support. Neil had the unfortunate
                            experience of carrying over a dozen body bags down from the site each
                            day. His regular job ceased while he helped out. He had an ID problem
                            being admitted to the pile, as he had changed his appearance for his
                            undercover narcotics role. Then he was transferred to the Fresh Kills
                            landfill, working 12 to 14 hour shifts. The ground at the landfill was
                            bubbling. Everyone had different jobs to do. Some splayed out the debris
                            from the pile, some combed through it to find personal items. He found
                            body parts burned into rebar. Neil knew it was a job he had to do with
                            dignity. He feels that those experiences at the landfill were an untold
                            story of a cold, lonely world of waste and loss of life. The landfill
                            was the only time he remembers crying and feeling helpless. He worked
                            there until 2/28/2002. According to his wife, he would have nightmares
                            about the work. She gave birth to triplets in that time, but Neil was
                            not happy. He had a loss of self-worth. He felt detached and lacked
                            emotional connection. He fell ill and developed a bad cough and upper
                            respiratory problems. After he had been on antibiotics for several
                            months, he was told that he was a liability to the police department due
                            to his illness. He was referred to the medical board for police officers
                            for early retirement. It was recommended that he get more help after
                            retirement in 2003. He continued to get sick and developed an autoimmune
                            disease. He also started to suffer with guilt, often thinking that he
                            could have done more to save lives and he second guessed himself. He
                            went for help and his psychologist said he had survivor’s guilt. He
                            wanted the sadness to end. His friends and family did their best to
                            help. He was not completely honest in therapy either, but he was able to
                            reach out to a fellow police officer who was able to remind him of his
                            helpful actions. Neil has now made it a point to start his own
                            rehabilitation. He went to visit the WTC on 2/28/2012, his own
                            anniversary of recovery and took his kids with him. He is now a stay at
                            home dad and glad to see his kids growing up and spend time with them.
                            In retrospect, Neil felt that the people in charge should have been more
                            thoughtful of the air quality. When they were eating they had to remove
                            their protective gear exposing them more to the poor air dust and
                            debris. Neil states, “I am one small story of many."

       John was a K-9 sergeant and supervisor. On 9/11 he was assigned to the
                            NYPD. It was his day off and he was at home with his 2 year old daughter
                            and 4 year old son while his wife was at work. She called him from
                            school and told him about the plane crash into the World Trade Center
                            tower. He thought it was an accident, but when the second plane hit he
                            knew that he had to respond, as was his duty as a police officer. He
                            called his mother-in-law to come and care for the kids and called his
                            wife to tell her he was responding to the emergency. He drove to his
                            office at Fort Totten in Queens, listening on the way to the radio. Dogs
                            in the K-9 division were cross-trained to work with the search and
                            rescue unit or patrol units, which apprehended suspects. They were
                            primarily German Shepherds. Each dog lived with its trainer to develop a
                            bond and strong relationship for the work required of them. John’s
                            department used a staggered approach to assigning the work. There were
                            25 officers and dogs in his unit. As supervisor, John stayed for 16
                            hours the first day, went home and returned the following morning. He
                            rarely saw his family as they were asleep when he got home and he left
                            early the next morning. John said that the dogs were perfect employees.
                            They always wanted to go to work and never called in sick. It took great
                            coordination and transportation to service the site. The SPCA had a
                            fully equipped mobile unit on site to care for the dogs that needed
                            physical as well as mental care. John felt that he was well trained for
                            a case such as this and did not feel overwhelmed. He worked in teams to
                            cover the different components of the pile. He had to make sure that the
                            environment was safe for the men as well as the dogs. There were many
                            places that were too hot for the dog’s feet. They also needed to be well
                            hydrated, sometimes with intravenous fluids at the mobile unit. The dogs
                            needed to be rewarded by finding a person alive to rescue, as there were
                            only body parts on the pile. To raise the dogs’ spirits with positive
                            reinforcement, responders on the pile would wrap themselves up in
                            blankets to be “rescued.” The teams consisted of two dogs, two handlers,
                            a spotter, an EMT officer and a search team. At the end of each shift
                            the teams would be debriefed by the supervisor and another team would
                            take over. After working ten days straight, John needed a day off. He
                            felt good about working at the site and was well prepared mentally and
                            physically. The camaraderie with the others working there was rewarding.
                            He did say that the disaster was 16 times greater than what was shown on
                            TV. He also did not feel the need to tell his wife the details of his
                            experience. He feels that people are beginning to forget 9/11, but that
                            the NYPD is even more prepared for another such disaster. John is now
                            retired after 23 years on the NYPD bomb squad.

       Anne Marie says of her life before 9/11: “I had a good, good thing
                            going.” But her existence as she knew it ended that day. The wife of an
                            NYPD patrol officer who was delivering summonses near the World Trade
                            Center on the morning of September 11 and was injured while he was
                            helping evacuate people from the area, Anne Marie’s resilience and spark
                            come through her narrative in spades. She was running errands when the
                            Towers were hit, and rushed home to find a message from her husband
                            Chris saying goodbye, in the event that he didn’t survive. She
                            eventually made contact with his precinct, calling the dispatchers back
                            throughout the day to ask if they heard him on the CB radio. After
                            sustaining an injury, Chris managed to return to their home on Long
                            Island, where he was almost immediately summoned back to Manhattan by
                            the NYPD to offer proof that he was hurt. Unbeknownst to the Baumanns,
                            this was only the first flash of the difficulties they would encounter
                            during Chris’ protracted recovery. The next day, he woke up blind, the
                            result of improperly treated burns and contamination to his eyes. Anne
                            Marie’s story is important for many reasons: not only does she provide
                            the essential perspective of the spouse of a responder who was injured
                            and traumatized, but she talks about the impact on their children; how
                            she found purpose in building a community of 9/11 responders and their
                            families; and the shocking lack of institutional support with which they
                            were confronted. Speaking about her work with the Feal Good Foundation
                            and other 9/11 wives, she says, “It empowered me. It did. It did. I felt
                            understood better. It’s different when you aren’t alone, swimming up
                            that stream.”

       Thomas was a chief executive officer for the Patrol Services Bureau of
                            the NYPD on 9/11. It was a primary day, and he was in charge of the
                            morning shift to oversee officers providing security at the polls. He
                            was working at his desk, when a few officers came in and told him that
                            the WTC tower was on fire. Tom looked out his window and saw that one of
                            the towers was on fire. He ordered his police officers to put on their
                            uniforms and accompany him to the site to see if they could help out.
                            They were within walking distance, so they decided to walk down there
                            because they knew that the traffic in the area would be congested and
                            they would have a difficult time getting there in their cars. Tom walked
                            with his subordinates towards Church and Vesey and saw the North Tower
                            on fire. There were people coming in from the opposite direction, trying
                            to get away from the chaos. As they moved towards the site, they were
                            focused on directing people away from the site and re-routing traffic.
                            When he got near the site, an officer told him that a plane had hit the
                            building. Tom could not believe it, and thought it was a horrible
                            mistake, when he noticed the second plane pass low overhead like a large
                            “black object” towards the South Tower. When he saw the second plane hit
                            he knew that they were under attack. As this plane hit the tower, the
                            impact caused shrapnel and debris to fall all around, and they ran to
                            avoid it. Tom knew that the next step had to be to set up a command post
                            somewhere nearby to get everyone organized. He ordered two officers to
                            be assigned to him and they took an abandoned post office nearby and set
                            it up as their primary command post. Then they started mapping out where
                            to put the officers to set up the perimeter. They went back out to help
                            people near the site and he noticed that people were jumping from the
                            burning towers. This was a scary experience, and Tom and his officers
                            tried to stay away from the jumpers and falling debris but at the same
                            time tried to help those to who needed to get to safety. During this
                            time, Tom, noticed a police chief he knew helping people get out of the
                            nearby subway. They made another makeshift command post at the nearby
                            American Express building, but as they got into the second floor, they
                            noticed that the building was starting to shake. The nearby South Tower
                            was starting to come down, and this caused the American Express building
                            to become unsteady. They ran out of the American Express building and
                            down the street in an attempt to get away from the plume of smoke
                            chasing them from the collapsing tower. Tom said he had “never run so
                            fast in his life.” They ran to nearby Stuyvesant High School and entered
                            just in time to escape from the avalanche of dust, smoke, and
                            suffocating debris. Tom described that during this time, his adrenaline
                            was pumping through his body at an all-time high. Tom also talked about
                            the leadership of the NYPD, and how the upper bosses took pride in being
                            in the thick of action with their subordinates. He also mentioned that
                            he didn’t seem to find that officers were afraid, he “was sure there was
                            fear…but he did not see it.” There was a female police officer with him
                            who was nervous because one of her family members worked in the towers,
                            and Tom ordered her to go back to the precinct and find out about her
                            family. They set up a permanent command post at Stuyvesant High School.
                            In setting up the command post, they looked for a room within the
                            building that had a chair, a phone, electrical outlet, desks and a
                            chalkboard. They could arrange the room however they wanted, as long as
                            the room had these essential components. They got all the students out
                            of the building, and Tom “had 100% faith that any order he gave was
                            done.” Tom and his group of officers went back out on the street after
                            setting up the command post. Outside he could see fire trucks covered
                            with debris, a gas line was broken up. The air was so thick with dust
                            that he could not see what was in front of him. Then the North Tower
                            started coming down and they had to run away from the falling debris.
                            The plume of smoke from the falling tower engulfed them, and Thomas
                            recalled that the “air was thick with crap.” Overhead he could hear
                            F-16s passing by, and he thought, “It is about time.” In the crowd of
                            people, Tom noticed a man taking pictures. He reprimanded him and took
                            away his camera. After the North Tower fell, they regrouped at Pier 16
                            and setup up a backup command post at the Pier. They created a roster of
                            all the people coming to the command post and during this time they also
                            divided “the pile” into separate sectors to be covered by police
                            personnel. They also set up a triage unit. Things were so stressful that
                            day that Tom actually resumed his smoking habit after having quit for a
                            long time. He said it was “the only vice” he went back to during this
                            time. Tom also spoke about the strong sense of charity and unity he
                            noticed during this period. They received free sandwiches and drinks
                            from Michael Bloomberg’s offices in lower Manhattan and Tom also
                            requested his brother who worked for Pepsi Co. to help during the
                            ensuing water supply shortage. Tom’s brother was able to get two trucks
                            full of water to be delivered to the WTC site to replenish the dwindling
                            water supply. There was also a strong sense of support from civilians,
                            who held signs up thanking the officers for their services. These signs
                            of unity and support greatly uplifted everyone’s spirits. On a side
                            note, during this chaos of 9/11, Tom also relayed a story of how his
                            wife called him up and asked him where their son (also a NYPD officer)
                            was stationed. Out of maternal instinct she wanted Tom to find his
                            whereabouts and get him back home. Tom replied that he could not do
                            that, and even if he tried, his son would refuse to abandon his duties
                            and return home. Tom managed and organized the operation from 9/11-9/15.
                            He went home that Saturday evening and before he got into bed, his wife
                            asked him how he was doing. It was the only time that he really got
                            emotional about the events of the past week, but he was so tired from
                            all the activity that he went to sleep. Tom continued to organize and
                            manage various NYPD department activities over the course of the few
                            months into November of 2001. He worked 12 hour shifts like other NYPD
                            officers. He worked primarily at the pile and was heavily involved in
                            communicating and coordinating patrol services with the National Guard.
                            Every day would start out with meetings in Mayor Giuliani’s office and
                            these meetings involved all the organizations helping out at the WTC
                            site. Tom was proud of all of his officers who were eager to help. Tom
                            attended several funerals of police officers, particularly from the Port
                            Authority, who perished on 9/11. At the time, he was a 20 year veteran
                            of the NYPD and had attended several police funerals in his tenure. Tom
                            credits a combination of family, his strong Catholic faith, and friends
                            to help him deal with the losses and stress he encountered during and
                            after 9/11. Tom’s family has been in the NYPD since 1920 and being a
                            part of the police is almost in the genes. Tom particularly recalls the
                            strong sense of unity in the few months following 9/11 and wished it
                            could have endured to the present day. He wished he could have saved a
                            lot more people, but being a boss in the police department since 1982,
                            he knows that, If you keep second-guessing yourself, you’ll never be a
                            good manager or a good boss. He reminds everyone, “Don’t forget what
                            happened here.” He is doing this oral history project to make sure
                            others remember what happened that day and, most especially, for his
                            grandchildren to remember.

       On 9/11 2001 Richard, an NYPD investigator for the Attorney General’s
                            office, took a train to his place of work at 120 Broadway and arrived
                            there just three minutes before the World Trade Center attack. He heard
                            a huge boom. When he arrived at the twelfth floor of his building, his
                            wife was calling his phone. He thought it was about their thirtieth
                            wedding anniversary and when she asked him if he was OK, he was baffled.
                            Then he looked out of the window and saw that one of the World Trade
                            Center towers were on fire. He and several other workers decided to go
                            over to the tower area. As they approached, they saw the second plane
                            hit. Richard knew then that it was not a missed approach to the airport
                            and started screaming at the airplane “You’re too low!” By now people
                            were running and screaming. He saw a fellow investigator and at One
                            Liberty Plaza and they decided to get back to their building. On the
                            twelfth floor he told the others that this was not an accident, it was
                            an attack and he changed into his police jacket which gave him a look of
                            authority. There were investigators coming up the stairs covered in dust
                            debris and glass. They advised everyone to evacuate the building. They
                            started helping people down the stairs as the elevators had stopped
                            working. As they reached the lobby, the first tower collapsed. Debris,
                            glass, and a huge dust cloud entered the lobby at 120 Broadway, and it
                            became hard to breathe as the cloud was infiltrating the building. They
                            managed to turn on the radio and heard that there were more hijacked
                            planes coming into the area, “at least a dozen.” Richard wet some
                            blankets to use as masks on the way down to get out of the building. He
                            also had two walkie talkies from home, which helped with communication
                            as all other means of communication were not working. Richard got
                            everyone together. There were other investigators and at least ten
                            civilians. As they made their way down and out of the building the other
                            WTC tower collapsed. This brought more dust and debris. It was hard to
                            see so they made a “daisy chain” to get through. Richard met up with a
                            firefighter who was having trouble breathing and was very upset, as he
                            had lost his entire group of firefighters. Richard could not see his
                            hand in front of his face, but took the lead and helped the distressed
                            firefighter. They headed out of the area to the South Street Seaport.
                            They were lucky and were able to hitch a ride there in a pickup truck.
                            Richard returned to 120 Broadway. He said, “When somebody needed help, I
                            automatically helped. It is part of my nature, it is part of my job.”
                            There was ash everywhere and eight to ten inches of debris in places.
                            The cars were covered with ash and debris. The Broadway building was
                            destroyed. There was broken glass and twisted metal all over, so they
                            called the Albany headquarters to report the situation and that they
                            were all OK. The street was littered with shoes. It looked people had
                            been blown right out of them. Richard looked like a ghost as he was
                            covered in grey white soot. He managed to get an agency car out of the
                            debris leave through the Midtown Tunnel. His wife worked at a restaurant
                            close to home and he found her. His older son, a sanitation worker, was
                            there. It was a very emotional reunion. His wife and son cried when they
                            saw him covered in soot and debris. That night at home he saw his
                            younger son, a Suffolk County police officer with EMT training, and his
                            eighteen month old granddaughter. During the next two weeks Richard
                            suffered from coughing up dirt and toxic debris. He went back to the
                            site and worked next to the pile on and off for several weeks, assisting
                            responders on the pile. He was assigned to view the dump truck loading
                            debris from the site to sift through it for human remains that were cast
                            aside with the debris. Richard needed a vacation and went to Hawaii
                            where he visited Pearl Harbor. This memorial had a strong emotional
                            impact on him. It brought back his memories of 9/11 and he said that he
                            now has a heightened sense of awareness wherever he is.

       Boomer is a retired NFL quarterback and current sports commentator.
                            Cantor Fitzgerald ( 101st floor of the North Tower) housed Boomer's
                            foundation for cystic fibrosis. He had 5 employees in his foundation and
                            over the years became very close with many of the Cantor Fitzgerald
                            employees sharing the space. One of the employees, Timothy, was a very
                            close friend On September 11th, Boomer sat in the Denver airport waiting
                            to return to New York after working as a Monday night analyst for the
                            football game between the Broncos and the Giants. Boomer was horrified
                            and heartbroken as he watched the attacks unfold. His foundation was
                            housed just above where the plane had hit. After the towers fell he
                            began to make calls to his wife, Timothy’s wife, and to Howard Lutnik,
                            the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. Howard answered the phone describing the
                            collapse and kept telling Boomer “They’re all dead. If they were at work
                            today, they are not coming home.” He was right, two thirds of the
                            company perished in the collapse, including Timothy. The flight to NY
                            was suspended and it took Boomer two and half days to find a private
                            flight to return home. As the plane flew over Manhattan he saw the
                            flashing of rescue workers vehicles and the flood lights, lighting up
                            the mess left by the collapse. It was a surreal moment filled with a
                            tremendous amount of grief. He couldn’t help but think of the horror so
                            many friends went through before they died. All he could do was hope and
                            pray it was quick and painless. Outback Steak House reached out to
                            Boomer to serve food to rescue workers at the site for a few weeks.
                            There was a metallic smell you could taste. All around was pain. For
                            Boomer, the experience was therapeutic. Being there and talking was the
                            right thing to do. Throughout this time he continued to make appearances
                            on TV related to sports but many discussions turned to the attacks and
                            the impact on him. Boomer say sports had a powerful impact when they
                            resumed. They gathered thousands of people and touched on the American
                            pride and patriotism in all the spectators. For Boomer, the aftermath of
                            the attacks was remarkable and should be remembered. People came
                            together to showed that we are a country of great, strong people.

       At the time of 9/11, Arthur lived on Long Island and owned a company
                            called Three Jay’s Restoration Incorporated, which restored exterior
                            building facades. Arthur said, “I tell everybody I’m a plastic surgeon
                            of buildings.” That morning, he and about a dozen employees were working
                            a job about two blocks from the World Trade Center. An old friend who
                            Arthur had recently had a big argument with called him to make amends,
                            and they made lunch plans. The friend was working in the North Tower.
                            Arthur headed up to the roof of the building where he was working, just
                            in time to hear and then see the first plan flying toward the WTC. He
                            watched in disbelief as it crashed through the tower, and immediately
                            started calling his friend back to tell him to get to the roof and use
                            the window washer scaffold equipment to try and save himself. Then the
                            second plane crashed into the South Tower and a fireball and debris came
                            right at the roof they were standing on. Arthur dove behind a bulkhead
                            and then put the fire out and then began taking pictures, knowing that
                            this was no accident. He saw countless police and firefighters rushing
                            towards the buildings. They stayed on the roof until the first building
                            began to fall, when they ran inside and ended up with employees of an
                            electrical engineering firm. Arthur recalled that they were panicked and
                            many wanted to leave but he convinced the manager to ask everyone to
                            stay put until the dust cleared. Once they reached the street, he
                            approached some men wearing FBI jackets and asked what they could do to
                            help. He moved a few vehicles and then people began to ask for rides out
                            of the area; Arthur spent the rest of the day taking people home, and
                            that evening actually drove through a closed toll lane on the Throgs
                            Neck. After getting home, he found a police officer’s hat in the back of
                            his truck with a business card inside—he called the person’s number many
                            times. When he didn’t hear back for some time, he assumed that she had
                            died—until she called him one day out of the blue. They became friends
                            after that, and it turned out that she, Nancy, had never even been in
                            his truck. When Nancy wanted to donate the hat to the Museum, she asked
                            for Arthur’s opinion and he insisted that it was her story, not his, to
                            tell. Even at the anniversaries, he didn’t feel he had a place there,
                            but that rather the ceremonies and recognition should be for the
                            “blues”: the cops and firefighters. Arthur returned to the city and the
                            building he had been working on a couple of days later at the request of
                            the FBI, who wanted the negatives from the photos he took and any
                            evidence. Arthur struggled seeing people trying to profit off 9/11, and
                            even with people around the site that he took to be for onlookers having
                            a “tourist experience.” Arthur has been affected by 9/11: he has health
                            concerns and also stated that it changed him as a person, affecting his
                            marriage. He’s much more closed off as a person now. He’s survived a
                            massive heart attack, and also sees a shrink regularly but doesn’t
                            discuss his feelings, and says, “Have I seen uh marriage counselors and
                            sex therapist of counseling and all this kind of stuff? Yes. Have I done
                            anything about it? No. I don’t want to get touchy feely anymore. It’s
                            over. I just want to finish out my years on this earth.” Arthur
                            acknowledged that he and his family are lucky—they are well-off
                            financially, and he should be happy.

       Robert was teaching a nutrition class in the Suffolk County Community
                            College when he heard of the first plane crashing into the World Trade
                            Center in the early morning of September 11, 2001. When his class ended,
                            Robert drove to the South Country Ambulance, where he volunteered as a
                            paramedic. From there, he and his colleagues headed in to respond to the
                            needs of the city. Robert recalls on the way to the World Trade Center,
                            he and his colleagues did not realize how serious the situation was
                            until they saw the closure of the Long Island Expressway and the smoke
                            building up in downtown Manhattan. When they arrived in Manhattan,
                            Robert witnessed thousands of people running, walking, and bicycling
                            away from the area. Robert clearly remembers a sergeant warning him and
                            his colleagues not to enter the area. “You don’t want to go down there,”
                            the distress sergeant warned Robert. “It’s the gate of hell.” Robert
                            emphasizes how impressed he was by the city’s organized emergency
                            response system. He saw “an entire office of FBI agents, desks,
                            computers, satellite dishes, telephones, fax machines, in the street,”
                            as well as ambulances and fire apparatus from the surrounding states on
                            the scene. As one of the FBI agents pulled up his car, the car was
                            “piled with dust…it looked like it had gone through a volcano ash fall.”
                            Everyone at the site was aware of the unforeseeable risks or a
                            possibility of further attacks, but they were all focused on one
                            important goal – to respond and save lives. After several hours of
                            watching and waiting at the staging area, Robert returned back to the
                            ambulance. It was there that he noticed that he had contact dermatitis
                            from his wrist to the elbow resulting from the dust in the air. It was
                            in that moment that he started to think about the toxicity of those
                            smoke and dust. Around three or four o’clock in the afternoon, the
                            response changed from a rescue to recovery. Robert was asked to help
                            with the recovery work, but he refused because he felt disheartened
                            knowing that they would rarely find anyone alive. After the events of
                            9/11, Robert turned from a very healthy to an extremely sick individual.
                            He was diagnosed with stage four laryngeal cancer, a direct result from
                            his experience at Ground Zero. This diagnosis was very emotional for
                            Robert. The political arguments surrounding the tenth anniversary of
                            9/11 was very upsetting and triggered him to seek mental health help for
                            his emotional well-being. Robert is thankful for programs like the World
                            Trade Center Health Program, which helped him to feel better and
                            healthier. In the future, he wishes the city to educate more of the
                            general public about mental health intervention in order to reduce the
                            stigma for those who need mental health assistance. Most importantly, he
                            hopes that these experiences can be recorded and become part of the
                            history that no one can change.

       James is a retired corrections officer for Nassau County Sheriff’s
                            Department. He is married with a daughter and son (who was born in
                            February 2001). On the morning of 9/11, James was sleeping; his wife
                            woke him to tell him what happened. He saw the second plane hit on TV.
                            In disbelief, he called his job to find out if they had any information.
                            His wife was hysterical. He left to pick his daughter up from school,
                            knowing it was no accident. Many other parents were there for the same
                            reason; the scene was chaotic. James’ sister-in-law worked at the
                            Pentagon and was there (she lost many colleagues). They wouldn’t hear
                            from her until the next day, and the family was frantic. James called
                            work and said he would stay on standby if needed. They knew they would
                            be needed. James had been to a couple of larger-scale emergencies, but
                            nothing of this magnitude. Through the day, he was in touch with
                            colleagues via phone. Eventually he stopped watching the news; he knew
                            that it wouldn’t give him the full picture. It upset him to think about
                            who would conceive of doing this. He felt angry. The next afternoon, his
                            sister-in-law called. She was a Lt. Colonel and had been debriefed on
                            the attacks. James was also debriefed once at work that day. He was
                            called in to speak with a lieutenant; they were looking for volunteers
                            and knew he was familiar with the city. Many of the guys he worked with
                            had already gone in on 9/11 within hours of the attack; several were
                            volunteer firefighters. James reported in uniform on the morning of
                            9/14; they were sent in five person groups by van and were scheduled for
                            12-hour shifts. There was a kind of excitement in the air, but as they
                            approached the city, they could see the dust cloud. It became more
                            serious. “It was like a Godzilla movie.” It took them only ten minutes
                            to drive all the way across town to the Javits Center, where they were
                            directed by a high-ranking NYPD official to do transports to Ground
                            Zero. They drove to the site, bringing down “fresh guys”—medical
                            personnel, other responders, etc., who needed to get to the site. They
                            also would make trips from the site to the morgue and wherever else was
                            needed. James recalls seeing law enforcement and responders from so many
                            different states—and there was camaraderie unlike ever before. James
                            felt very angry about the events, which only increased when he saw the
                            destruction in person. He didn’t think the city could come back from it.
                            It was shocking, but he noticed that everyone tended to snap into their
                            “training.” James talked about seeing a McDonald’s set up in a mobile
                            unit, but also noted that the food was being cooked and eaten in the
                            middle of the dust. James talked in some detail about how the morgue was
                            set up. He didn’t leave after his first 12-hour shift was meant to be
                            over; he and others slept in their vans. Friends who lived in Manhattan
                            would bring him food. James also noted that the city recovered on
                            different timelines—uptown NYC was back to normal really quickly. “They
                            felt it, but they didn’t see it.” He also talked about the sheer number
                            of civilians who responded to the attacks and aftermath—not just people
                            who were trained for such a thing. James was there the entire weekend,
                            but still feels he didn’t do enough to help. He feels it was a privilege
                            to help, and he still thinks about how many people were lost, or lost
                            someone. When he finally went home, he stood in the driveway to remove
                            his uniform and bagged it, standing there in his underwear. Before doing
                            anything else, he showered for a long time. He felt the juxtaposition of
                            being safe at home after having left a destroyed city. He felt guilty.
                            Although his family asked many questions, he didn’t want to discuss it
                            for a few months afterward. His daughter was always intrigued by Ground
                            Zero, and James would take her into the city every year. Once when she
                            was doing a school report on the subject, they went and she was able to
                            interview workers rebuilding the site. He has talked to his children
                            about 9/11 and emergency situations in general, teaching them
                            preparedness. In his interview, James talked about not wanting to
                            discuss the events, but then realizing how lucky he turned out to be
                            after coming to the Program, and how important it is to talk about it,
                            and keep doing so. He also mentioned the importance of talking to
                            children, especially those who lost family in the events, about what
                            happened so they truly understand. He emphasized the importance of not
                            lumping ethnic or religious groups into one. Remembrance is critical.
                            James also talked about his memories of Battery Park City and the
                            community there, and how welcoming they had always been in the past. He
                            remembers being invited onto strangers’ houseboats. Even though they’ve
                            rebuilt, it’s no longer the same for him. James doesn’t believe the
                            government has responded correctly as far as caring for the responders.
                            It’s not about money necessarily, but about healthcare.

       On 9/11/2001, Steven was working as a paramedic with New York
                            Presbyterian Hospital. He started his day early that morning at 7:30 am
                            with his partner Tony, as they prepared for a 12 hour shift. They
                            stopped at a coffee shop where he bought coffee, breakfast and his usual
                            draw of lottery tickets. They were in the ambulance and turned on the
                            radio when they heard an associate screaming about a plane hitting the
                            WTC. They self-dispatched, hit their sirens, and drove through the FDR
                            drive where they could see smoke over the horizon. They were hearing
                            over the dispatch radios that a small plane had crashed into the WTC.
                            Steven thought it was a computer flight simulation exercise that went
                            horribly wrong. Later reports confirmed it was not a small plane. They
                            were over the Brooklyn Bridge when the second plane hit, but they did
                            not see it as they were on the east side by Beekman Hospital by City
                            Hall. They saw smoke and shards of office paper in the sky. Steven’s
                            partner had more training in WMDs and knew it was a terrorist attack. As
                            they approached the WTC area, they saw a huge fireball and plume of
                            smoke from the top of each tower. Up to this event, the protocol for
                            high building fires was to set up a triage center downstairs by the
                            lobby of the building. For some reason they did decided not to set up
                            the triage within the buildings. This was a wise decision as the
                            buildings later collapsed. Instead, Steven and Tony backed their
                            ambulance into a building a few blocks away and started work on setting
                            up a triage for people who came in with burns, cuts, bruises, shock, and
                            more serious injuries. Steven recalled an Asian woman who came into the
                            unit with 1st and 2nd degree burns and was in a panic state. She wanted
                            to get home to her family, but they convinced her to stay for a bit
                            while they dressed her wounds. She soon left the triage to go back home.
                            Steven realized many people were coming in with wounds and a panicked
                            state of mind. He knew from years of paramedical experience that panic
                            was counterproductive to action. He had always instructed his family
                            members to have a plan and keep their composure in times of crisis and
                            to keep the panic at bay. Even in spite of 25 years of paramedical
                            experience, adrenaline was coursing through Steven’s body and his hands
                            shook with adrenaline and fear. This was an event unlike any other. When
                            he looked up he saw fires pouring out of the upper stories of the
                            towers. They kept two radios in their ambulance—a radio for emergency
                            communications and a private radio. Streams of communication and
                            requests for assistance were coming through these radios. When Tower 2
                            collapsed first, Steven yelled over the radio to his supervisor that the
                            tower came down. No one on the other side of the transmission initially
                            believed him. People were in a state of shock. They noticed a man who
                            simply stared transfixed as the towers came down and was oblivious to
                            the debris falling around him. Steven’s partner, Tony, who was
                            powerfully built, picked up the man and brought him to a safer location.
                            Later, at the triage unit, they met a firefighter with a shard of
                            aluminum in his eye. It had penetrated quite deep, so they irrigated the
                            eye with some eyewash and suggested he should go to the hospital. At the
                            hospital they were able to get the aluminum out and provided him with
                            some antibiotics. The firefighter later returned to the triage center to
                            thank Steven and his partners for their foresight and advice. The rest
                            of their time at the site was “anti-climactic.” They worked on and
                            around the site for two weeks and worked with different agencies,
                            especially the Office of Emergency Management (OEM), which had a command
                            center by the Pier. Steven noticed that people who encountered this
                            disaster had three different types of responses. The first group were
                            people who mechanically did their job at the site and went home
                            afterwards; the second group were people who were deeply and outwardly
                            affected by the disaster and incapacitated to help; and the third group
                            worked assiduously on the required help needed and came back to put in
                            more hours at the site when required. This last group was most dedicated
                            to their mission. At the conclusion of the interview, Steven talked
                            about terrorism and the reaction to terrorism around the world. He
                            mentioned that it is only one percent of people in the world who commit
                            acts of terrorism and act on evil intentions. The rest of the world
                            consists of people from many different cultures and faiths, and
                            irrespective of these different backgrounds, they all want the same
                            thing—the very best for their children and the future generation. He
                            lauds the courageous efforts of the firefighters and other emergency
                            responders who braved the worst of environments and risked their lives
                            to save people in the towers. Steven feels it would be nice if more of
                            these responders got the credit and respect for what do on a day-to-day
                            basis. He also recalled how nice he felt when people in Manhattan
                            thanked him and other responders for how they came to their aid. Steven
                            is glad for this opportunity to share this story of his 9/11/2001 rescue
                            and recovery efforts and to keep it for posterity.

       Ann worked as Dean of Student Affairs at the United States Merchant
                            Marine Academy (USMMA) in Kings Point, NY on 9/11. She is now an
                            associate professor at the same institution. Her father made a career in
                            the Navy, and she grew up loving the Navy and loving ships. Her father
                            served during WWII on an aircraft carrier and also during the Korean
                            War. Ann’s interview gave interesting insight into the experiences
                            (sometimes “brutal”) of a woman in mariner/military capacities and how
                            things have changed. The morning of 9/11, she was in the Dean’s office,
                            where there are big windows that look directly over the Long Island
                            Sound to Manhattan. She was sitting with her back facing the windows,
                            and suddenly the Dean said that a plane went into the World Trade
                            Center. The USMMC was originally told that they would act as triage
                            transport due to their proximity to North Shore Long Island Jewish
                            Hospital in Manhasset, NY. However, after realizing that there weren’t
                            any people to triage, they were transitioned into a temporary morgue.
                            Later, they utilized their resources in other aspects of the effort.
                            USMMC had various resources of cadets, ships, and even a volunteer EMS
                            squad at the Academy. One of the EMS students was only 15—she was the
                            commandant’s daughter—and Ann speculates that she was likely the
                            youngest responder. Ann was so proud of the students and their
                            incredible way that they handled the entire situation. Students lined up
                            to help, even volunteering for “toe tag” duty. She remembers that many
                            of the students had family working at the Pentagon and WTC, which was
                            difficult. Ann noted that mariners are under legal obligation to render
                            aid to those in need, but even before that became law, they had a moral
                            obligation. She notes that when the attacks occurred, every ship,
                            commercial boat, private boat, etc. that was on the water stopped and
                            gave aid, including transport across the rivers. While in the waterways
                            surrounding Manhattan, the USMMC and their volunteer crews along with
                            Ann performed many duties, utilizing their expertise. They used their
                            ships to transport people, necessary materials, and supplies. Using
                            boats for this meant responders and materials could reach Manhattan in a
                            matter of minutes rather than having to drive in and out. Ann worried
                            that the responding crew was going to get burnt out quickly, and sure
                            enough, she was called that night to come relieve people on duty. She
                            had gone to bed at midnight and remembers that the dean got a call
                            around 3:30am to respond and called her—she pulled on her clothes and
                            ran down to the water, afraid they would leave her behind. Ann talked
                            about how she had to instill confidence in the crew working under
                            her—they were smart and capable but inexperienced. There were no mental
                            health services for the student responders after the fact, and because
                            they were not yet commissioned or licensed, she suspected they feared
                            being penalized if diagnosed with PTSD or some other issue. Their
                            response effort lasted for nine days, and theirs was the only service
                            academy that responded. Ann had been offered the chance to go see Ground
                            Zero (which couldn’t be seen from the water), but she declined, feeling
                            it was disrespectful to do that. She remarked on the calm and focus of
                            the responders. Despite being so close to the area, they had to watch
                            the news to find out what was going on; she comments that the press gave
                            the impression that everything was such chaos, and Ann disagrees based
                            on her observations. Choking up, Ann said, “This was thousands of people
                            who stopped their lives and said ‘My life is less important,’ and
                            stopped to help.” People would have done anything in the hope that they
                            would find survivors, and the fact that there were so few was very
                            difficult. Ann talked about how the mariners were instrumental in
                            getting various donations, like fuel and water. Ann worked about 16
                            hours that first shift. She was determined to send her crew, many of
                            whom were essentially high school kids, “home to their mothers.” In an
                            instant, they had become adults. When she got back to her community, she
                            saw that almost every home had an American flag out front. The first
                            thing she did at home was email her family and let them know she was
                            alright. She later found out that in those first hours before she made
                            contact, her mother was worried and her father said in response, “She’s
                            busy…she is down working in Manhattan. She’ll contact us when she can.”
                            Ann says, “He knew. He was the only person who knew.” Ann’s father is
                            the only person who ever asked her if she was ok—she says that no one
                            else ever contacted her, unlike many of the male mariners. She
                            attributes this to the idea that while people assumed that the men were
                            responding, it seemed that no one believed that women would be
                            responding. Ann is proud that there was no gender-based discrimination
                            toward mariners who wanted to respond. She tells an anecdote about how
                            Canadians were flying American flags and they became so highly in demand
                            that people would steal them off others’ porches. She remarked on a
                            misunderstanding held by people outside the country (she was referring
                            to her cousin’s daughter’s class in Canada) that Manhattan was wiped
                            out. She also told a story about Windows on the World: she had attended
                            an event there in dress uniform and checked her hat in the coat check.
                            When she came out, one of the coat check women said “I hope you don’t
                            mind, but we’ve been having a lot of fun trying your hat on!” Ann
                            thought it was very funny. It turned out, however, that when the Port
                            Authority released the tapes of the restaurant calling for help on 9/11,
                            Ann recognized one of the voices as belonging to that woman. She says
                            that the woman was “So calm, and focused. The only thing she cared about
                            was taking care of the patrons.” She died in the attacks. Ann says, “The
                            stunning presence and maturity of our students was amazing….We don’t
                            give our younger people enough credit for their intelligence and
                            presence.”

       Christopher was an NYPD detective on 9/11. He had been with the force for
                            3 years at that point. He currently is still on the job and has lived in
                            Long Island for the past 8 years. At the time of 9/11, Christopher was
                            living in Queens and was stationed at the 71st precinct in Brooklyn. He
                            was off from work the entire week preceding 9/11, and was scheduled to
                            return to command the afternoon of 9/11. When the first plane hit the
                            first tower, he was sleeping. He woke up shortly afterwards, turned on
                            his small black-and-white TV and watched the news through the static
                            showing up on his screen. He got ready and ended up getting to the 71st
                            precinct between 12pm and 1pm. Everything was a mass scramble at the
                            precinct. At about 10pm, he went down to the WTC site, as directed, with
                            fellow officers and their sergeant. Adrenaline was pumping as all the
                            officers boarded the bus, and Christopher was wide awake due to his
                            adrenaline and blood rushing throughout his body. There was a lot of
                            camaraderie between his fellow officers at this point, followed by
                            feelings of sorrow as they were on board the police bus bound for the
                            WTC site; they were not exactly sure what to expect. When they were near
                            the WTC site, they filled a parking lot that had generators going as
                            they waited for further direction. Christopher explains that, "It was a
                            waiting game," and they, "Weren’t thinking about the air quality."
                            Christopher explains how as time went on the officers reported straight
                            to their normal precinct before each shift, for the most part. They only
                            reported straight to the WTC site about 1-2 times. He typically worked
                            during the night shifts and dug in the pile a number of times throughout
                            his time on-site. More confusion came up when they were given paper
                            masks; they laughed. They were given better masks, but kept getting
                            conflicting directions on which to use. To this day, Christopher isn’t
                            sure what they should have been using since there was never a straight
                            answer. Once while digging in the pile, he saw something that looked
                            like a human bone. He notified the proper personnel that would
                            investigate it and handle it properly, which was the protocol. He never
                            found out if it was actually a human bone since he was then moved to a
                            different spot. He was involved in the bucket brigade lines, and
                            Christopher states that there were many bucket brigade lines going on at
                            the same time. He was also doing a lot of traffic control in the
                            surrounding area. Christopher recalls the Campbell’s Soup truck came
                            down to serve food and they were relatively close to the pile and during
                            breaks respirators typically came off. The NYPD shifts were structured
                            for 12 hours, but they actually ended up being 16-17 hours; he became
                            fatigued and often just went into "auto-pilot." His mother was proud of
                            him for helping with the WTC disaster. She continues to be proud of him
                            for his current job duties with the NYPD. Even though Christopher had
                            only been on the job for 3 years, he was still familiar with some NYPD
                            officers that perished that day. In particular, he knew Sergeant Tim
                            Roy, who was previously in the 71st precinct, and who passed away that
                            day. Christopher continued to work at the WTC site until January or
                            February 2002. He feels proud of the work that he did and being able to
                            help. He was in the military before going into the NYPD and he’s always
                            had the desire to help others. He states that he would do it again if he
                            had to, but he would like to be better prepared with necessary
                            equipment. Due to his time on the site, he has suffered from kidney
                            cancer and other smaller stomach issues. Taking care of his health is a
                            time consuming thing since he has to attend many medical appointments
                            (i.e. diagnostic, blood work, etc.) when he’s off-duty. He still feels
                            disappointed in how things were handled and says that we shouldn’t take
                            anything for granted, especially our freedoms and our liberty.

       Bruce was born in Bethpage, NY, where he grew up in a family of IBEW
                            Local 3 electricians. His grandfather, father, and brother were all
                            Local 3 Electricians as well as other family members. His father helped
                            build the WTC Towers and also worked on the towers in the ’70s with
                            Bruce’s brother. This is why the towers were special to Bruce; there was
                            a personal connection with the WTC Towers. On the day of 9/11, Bruce was
                            working in Queens and went up on the roof of that building and saw
                            first-hand what was taking place. Bruce and his colleagues knew other
                            workers who work in the buildings. Bruce and his friend, Jerry, knew
                            they needed to get down there and they contacted their union to see how
                            they can help and utilize their skills. Since Bruce worked quite
                            frequently with Verizon and their electrician needs, he was very
                            valuable to the current situation. He states that pretty much all of
                            downtown was affected by the collapse of the towers. The CEO of Verizon
                            got a call from President Bush urging him to get the NY Stock Exchange
                            back up and running. On the Friday morning following the WTC disaster,
                            Bruce and his 7 colleagues came into Canal Street in Manhattan then were
                            had a police escort to their work destination. The conditions were hard
                            to endure, there was dust everywhere. The first day they got there
                            wasn’t that bad, due to rainfall, which kept the dust controlled a
                            little bit. Verizon picked out the key elements that they needed powered
                            and they worked on this. Bruce and his colleagues worked to get the
                            Stock Exchange up-and-running again as quickly as possible and it ended
                            up opening Monday morning. When he was first down at the WTC disaster
                            area there was no real food around during their breaks, and they had to
                            go off-site to get something to eat. In addition to this, when his
                            shifts were over, he only went home for an hour or two to clean up and
                            quickly rest. His wife was worried about Bruce’s work at this point, but
                            understood that it was "more than just a job." Compared to what Bruce
                            has done in the past, his WTC disaster duties were a lot more dangerous.
                            Bruce worked a lot with Tishman Construction Company and also had a lot
                            of duties ensure that generators were working properly. Bruce really
                            felt proud of what he was able to do. He had 2 children at the time, in
                            middle school and high school and they asked questions about their dad’s
                            work and what had happened. Bruce states that he answered them as
                            truthful as possible without being too depressing. He’s since retired,
                            but continues to stay active in the 9/11 community and among advocate
                            groups. He recalls going to 9/11 memorials as well as taking a bus trip
                            to Washington, DC, with the FealGood Foundation to lobby to pass the
                            Zadroga Bill. He felt that attending this DC trip was empowering and has
                            heightened his political awareness. Looking back, Bruce doesn’t “regret”
                            the decision to work at the WTC Site. He’s unsure if he would do it any
                            differently. Bruce was working down in that area until November 2002.
                            Bruce and some of his colleagues he was with contracted serious illness,
                            including Bruce himself, who battled stage 4 lymphoma for 2 years. It
                            angers him that his illness was originally not covered by the WTC Health
                            Program. One of the good things coming out of all this is that he was
                            one of the IBEW Local 3 representatives at the Stock Exchange closing
                            bell ceremony after it was operating again. He feels that he performed a
                            very patriotic duty with his colleagues in going to the WTC disaster
                            area and helping repair the damaged infrastructure.

       Edward came from a family of blue-collar workers, but he was the first to
                            be an IBEW Local 3 electrician. He recalls the gorgeous blue sky the
                            morning of 9/11, before the attacks. Edward just started a job at the
                            WTC on Monday, September 10th. On 9/11 (his second day on this job), he
                            was working on the 57th floor of the WTC South Tower (Tower 2) with 9
                            other colleagues. He never enjoyed working in the towers because they
                            were so big and it was difficult to get to various areas in the
                            buildings. He and his colleagues heard a big explosion; they weren’t
                            quite sure what had happened. They thought that maybe a transformer blew
                            up. They also noticed papers flying outside and a bunch of smoke filling
                            the outside air. Six of the 10 guys left the job site once they heard
                            the first explosion. After speaking with his wife on the phone and
                            hearing an announcement over the P.A. system in the South Tower, they
                            knew that a plane had hit the North Tower. The remaining four guys in
                            his group, including himself, decided to leave the building, but were in
                            no rush or panic. They were informed at that point that the South Tower
                            was secure. Edward chuckles now when he thinks back at them putting
                            their tools away and locking them up before proceeding down the stairs.
                            They even waited a little until the stairs weren’t as crowded. Edward
                            recalls the crowded stairways, but stated that the people weren’t
                            panicked. He also remembers seeing the firefighters going up the stairs
                            as they were going down. They got out of the towers and started walking
                            up Broadway. He never thought that they buildings were going to come
                            down. He was right on the outside rings of the dust that spread across
                            much of the area. He ended up going to the Nancy Whiskey Pub with his
                            colleagues, where they met some ironworkers. He ended up catching his
                            normal train and getting home at his normal time that day. When he got
                            home, his wife and kids were so happy that he was home safe. He
                            continually shared his experiences with his family. The following
                            Monday, he went to 120 Broadway and continued doing some electrician
                            work there for a while until he went to work at 1 World Financial Center
                            around Thanksgiving 2001. The building was still damaged at this point,
                            and he continued to work here for 4-5 months at this location. According
                            to Edward, IBEW Local 3 lost about 18 guys, a couple of whom he knew. In
                            addition, his friend Vito, one of the four that was with him that day,
                            just passed away this Thanksgiving (2013). He has been retired since
                            2007, when he was 60 years old. He currently suffers from sinusitis
                            related to his work down at the WTC disaster area.

       Michael worked as a worldwide security officer for Merrill Lynch on 9/11
                            and previously was a lieutenant for the NYPD. He remembers the morning
                            of 9/11 being a beautiful day; he took the LIRR into the city and then
                            the E train to the end of the line, the WTC stop, to get to his office.
                            When he got out of the subway station, he saw a girl running and
                            screaming. He noticed that the stores on the lower level of the WTC were
                            open, but didn’t have any people inside, not even staff. The fountain at
                            the WTC had very little water pressure and lots of debris was in the
                            area. Michael started to look for any injured people, scanning the area
                            as his emergency training taught him. He then went outside and actually
                            saw the tail of the second plane going into the second tower,
                            immediately followed by a fireball. Michael was confused as to what was
                            happening, but proceeded to start evacuating the Merrill Lynch staff
                            from their offices at the World Financial Center Buildings. The
                            executive board members were hesitant at first, and figured that they
                            would be fine staying put, but they eventually listened to Michael and
                            his team and relocated at the condo of one of the board members. While
                            in the area around the WTC, Michael heard a number of gunshots on the
                            street and realized that it was cops shooting out storefronts to seek
                            refuge from the dust and falling debris. Once the people were out of the
                            Merrill Lynch offices, Michael had to go back with a few people to
                            obtain vital files from their offices. Michael states that they didn’t
                            really have back-ups in those days so they had to retrieve their only
                            copies of these important documents. He recalls the building being so
                            hot that they had to strip off their clothes and break open windows to
                            cool down. They drank water from any available water bottles left on
                            people’s desks. They continued almost daily to go back to the offices
                            and obtain more files until early December. Merrill Lynch moved their
                            staff to their Washington Street address for the time being. His friend
                            who was “high-up” in the FDNY was in command of the FDNY response to the
                            North Tower. He ordered the firefighters to evacuate over the radios,
                            which many of the guys couldn’t hear and didn’t make it out of the tower
                            before its collapse. Michael states that communication (and the
                            technology they were using to communicate) was a big issue that day.
                            Later in the day, Michael recalls seeing actor James Gandolfini at an
                            area drug store as Michael was picking up supplies. He also recalls the
                            dichotomy between the disaster area and upper Manhattan. When traveling
                            in upper Manhattan, he saw people sitting at outdoor café tables, having
                            meals and cocktails. It didn’t seem like they were impacted at all by
                            what had just happened. Michael came home late that night and didn’t
                            really understand what had happened until later in the day. Throughout
                            the day, he was zoned in on evacuating people and getting them safely
                            away from the disaster area. Michael continued to work 12 hour days, 6
                            days per week until early December 2001, going back-and-forth between
                            their World Financial Center buildings and their other offices on
                            Washington Street to get necessary files and documents. Merrill lost 2
                            people that day. Michael also lost his nephew, Keith, who was in the
                            South Tower when it collapsed. Michael brought his son to the area
                            shortly afterwards and his son mentioned how interesting it was how all
                            the papers flying around were so important the day before 9/11, and now
                            they were just debris; it’s an interesting look at priorities and
                            knowing what’s really important in life. He recalls many of the Merrill
                            Lynch employees (many of whom he didn’t even know) thanking him for his
                            duties on 9/11 and getting them out of their building safely. He states
                            that people were all equal that day, there was no prejudice, and
                            everyone was working together.

       Brian was the Operations Manager of the New York Presbyterian Hospital
                            EMS during 9/11. He currently works at North Shore LIJ with their EMS
                            unit. NY Presbyterian EMS had a huge scope of work and location to cover
                            on a daily basis. On the morning of 9/11, Brian received a call from his
                            boss notifying him that a plane went into the Trade Center. He started
                            to pair up their EMS personnel and got them ready in case they were
                            needed. To find out more detailed information, Brian went into the
                            communications center and from there saw the 2nd plane go into the 2nd
                            tower. The fire department said to send whatever they had, so they made
                            a convoy of ambulances, and other cars with supplies, etc. Brian
                            responded with them in his own vehicle. Brian states that it probably
                            only took them about 5 minutes to get through, but it felt like forever.
                            As he was driving, he started to take some pictures using a disposable
                            camera that he carried with him while on the job. When they arrived at
                            the WTC site, he saw people running toward him and screaming. He was
                            under his truck, laying on West Street when the tower fell. Brian
                            equates the force and wind to a tornado. The convoy parked under a
                            pedestrian bridge in the area. The sound was deafening. They were
                            approaching on foot but were turned back to go to the medical staging
                            area. Then they heard a noise—Brian looked up West St. and watched what
                            looked like a wave receding from one of the towers. A man in a full run
                            was headed toward them and was screaming for them to get down. He tried
                            to get under his car, and then the wave hit. Something took a chunk out
                            of his helmet. For a time he thought all his guys were dead because no
                            one responded to his roll call over the radio. Brian helped a
                            firefighter free a man from under a truck and helped evacuate some
                            injured people. He found the medical staging area and helped take some
                            more injured people to the marina to evacuate. They watched the second
                            tower come down and the wave make its way to them again. He ended up
                            going to Cornell Medical Center; everyone got patched up there. At about
                            4pm, he learned a crew from his team was missing. They found their
                            ambulance—and learned they had been one of the first crews into respond.
                            Instead of loading the ambulance and leaving, they kept treating people
                            and handing them off to be transported. This crew then went into the
                            South Tower to evacuate people. Brian was eventually sent home by his
                            boss, and didn’t go back to work in the area. He’s had feelings of
                            survivor guilt to this day, and feels someone was looking out for him
                            that day. The experience really made him reassess the importance of his
                            family, etc. Brian also mentioned the difficulties of having to rebuild
                            their department and their vehicles, etc.

       Daniel was born in Brooklyn, NY and grew up in Hicksville on Long Island.
                            He worked for 18 years in the Harbor Unit in Brooklyn. His daily
                            activities included rescue and recovery, suicides, drownings, plane
                            crashes, and many other things as part of the dive team. Daniel says
                            there are always a lot of things in the water that shouldn’t be, for
                            numerous reasons. While in the Bronx for riot and crowd control training
                            on September 11th, Daniel heard that a plane had hit one of the Twin
                            Towers, and he and his partner left the training to head back to their
                            own unit. They could see the towers burning in the distance as they
                            returned to Brooklyn. When they arrived, everyone had already left so
                            they took the last boat and headed downtown. They spent the next week
                            working 24 hour shifts, ferrying people from Manhattan to New Jersey.
                            The maritime community has their own communication system that does not
                            rely on the antenna on top of the towers so they were not impacted the
                            way the police and firefighter communities were. They remained on the
                            water in the area for the next year offering support services to the
                            rescue and recovery effort. They ferried rescue workers and supplies in
                            and out, as many of the roads were closed or jammed and the quickest way
                            to the site was via water. Daniel doesn’t feel that he was impacted
                            personally by the events; he states that this type of thing is so common
                            in world affairs that it almost seemed like it was our turn to become
                            embroiled in it. He found the loss of life and destruction very sad, but
                            death is such a common part of his job that it is "just a given." Daniel
                            remains healthy and has not really focused on the aftermath, but he
                            believes that it is important for the kids to learn about the events
                            that led up to that day. He hopes they learn from the aftermath and
                            embrace diversity.

                            On the morning of September 11th, Robert was at work in the city and had
                            stopped to get breakfast at a deli when he saw the Twin Tower burning on
                            the television. He watched the events for a little while and then went
                            to the shop, where everyone was talking about it. They went to the site
                            that afternoon to help as they could – shoring up cement that was
                            falling, clearing out subway entrances and sidewalks. Robert was very
                            upset that they weren’t allowed to go to the pile to help look for
                            survivors. They stayed until the middle of the night, and were able to
                            go home. The walk back was very hard; Robert describes people cheering
                            for them, saying thank you – this upset him because he felt they didn’t
                            do anything heroic. Robert describes the guilt he felt for being with
                            the clean-up crew as a part of his normal job, not as a volunteer like
                            so many workers at the site. He would not permit any of his men to take
                            the boots that they were offered, stating that his men were going home
                            tonight and could clean up, take a shower – these were supplies for the
                            volunteers who were staying overnight and not getting paid time and a
                            half for their efforts. Making money off the tragedy didn’t sit well
                            with Robert. Once he made it home, his oldest daughter was waiting up
                            for him. She had been watching the news and drew a picture of the towers
                            burning. Robert describes the disturbing image, and the impact that the
                            event had on her at nine years old. Many years later, she also
                            incorporated 9/11 into an essay written for college applications. He
                            finds it very upsetting that she still thinks about it, as he puts quite
                            a bit of effort into not thinking about it at all. Robert speaks about
                            the importance never forgetting, because maybe something similar will
                            happen 50 years from now; always be aware. He surprised himself by
                            getting choked up a few times and hopes that he hasn’t "opened up a can
                            of worms" by speaking about his experiences. His heart goes out to those
                            who lost loved ones on that day and wonders how they deal with it – “It
                            wasn’t an accident, wasn’t God’s will, wasn’t their choice.”

       Bob grew up in Centereach, NY. He is a carpenter and lives in Shirley;
                            he’s married with two young kids, and is now retired on disability. He
                            met his wife while renovating a house—she lived next door. At time of
                            9/11 he was working on Long Island as a union carpenter, and also did
                            heavy construction and concrete work, etc. That day, he was working in
                            Nassau County, and was getting coffee when he was told a plane had hit
                            Tower One. Most of the workers left the site—he went home and turned on
                            the TV. The next day, he returned to work and could smell the dust and
                            smoke. He and his coworkers began to organize to respond together. They
                            arrived at the site Friday morning, a mix of carpenters and laborers.
                            They went into a firehouse and were given equipment, then consolidated
                            everything to be driven to the site. Eventually he got together with a
                            few others and grabbed more equipment so they could work on the pile
                            itself. They were told to always stay in pairs. They dug and cut through
                            debris with torches. He recalls that when they stopped work to listen in
                            the pile for survivors, you could hear a pin drop. They were moved a
                            couple of times for safety reasons. Becoming emotional as he spoke, Bob
                            marveled at the amount of donated equipment, and how accessible it was
                            to them, as well as the people on the bucket brigade itself. He
                            remembered being given a flimsy mask and goggles, but that they weren’t
                            useful because it was so hot that they goggles would fog up and the
                            masks did nothing. They found some personal effects and human remains.
                            Bob remembered seeing a fireman from Georgia digging with his hat. Bob
                            recalled the sight of cars abandoned on the street, and tables with
                            papers and coffee cups still on them. His interview also touched upon
                            the respite areas, which had food and other supplies. They worked until
                            4am that day and stopped with others at a topless bar on the way home.
                            Once home, Bob threw away his clothes and showered before going to bed.
                            He remembers that he continued to cough a lot after returning home and
                            thought about what must have been burning on the pile in addition to the
                            dust. As soon as the WTC Medical Monitoring program began, he joined,
                            and encouraged others to do so, but none of his friends did. He does
                            continue to have breathing issues. The generosity of the people who
                            helped both on the pile and off is something that has stayed with him.

       Heather grew up in Colorado Springs, CO, and moved to Long Island, when
                            she was younger. She has two children who are now teenagers. Growing up,
                            Heather always wanted to be involved in law enforcement. At the time,
                            she had family members that were a judge and a police officer. When
                            Heather first got on the NYPD, it was quite unusual for woman to be
                            police officers. There was a real divide between her and her male
                            colleagues. She was immediately placed on the night shifts and faced
                            many challenges in getting her respect from her fellow police officers
                            and the department. However, she had a strong motivation to be the best
                            she could be and wanted to be an inspiration to other women. Her husband
                            at the time was also a NYPD police officer and he was honest with her
                            about what it would be like to be a female police officer in the NYPD.
                            Heather mentions that she really likes the NYPD and it’s a lot more
                            female friendly now than when she first joined the force. On 9/11, she
                            went to take her children out of school, coordinated their care, and
                            then went back into work. For the first twenty-four hours, they weren’t
                            allowed to go down to the Trade Center because of the unknown
                            possibility of future dangers. She recalls seeing the officers that were
                            coming back from the WTC (the first responders), covered in dust and not
                            saying a word. Throughout her time working at the WTC site, she had a
                            dichotomy of feelings – feeling hopeless meanwhile being motivated by
                            the families of the victims and trying to find something from their
                            loved ones. When Heather saw destruction, she also saw the showing of
                            support. Heather speaks about her reactions to 9/11 and how it was such
                            an “inhumane” thing that was done. There is no way that they could have
                            prepared for such a disaster. During the rescue effort, she couldn’t
                            feel like a hero because they weren’t finding anyone. Heroes are seen
                            for saving people and they weren’t able to really do that during this
                            disaster. For a while after 9/11, Heather walked around “in a fog”. She
                            had sent her kids to stay with their grandparents in Pennsylvania for a
                            couple of weeks since she was so busy working her shifts. Heather
                            recalls, vividly, that one of hardest things that she had to do was
                            telling her kids “I don’t know when I’ll be back” when she dropped them
                            off. This is the horrifying truth for a police officer; they put
                            themselves in harm’s way so often. They can never expect what is going
                            to happen on their upcoming shift. Heather realizes that it’s important
                            for the younger generation to know what happened and how the responders
                            were affected by 9/11. She’s worried about long-term health effects from
                            the toxins in the air. She’s starting to have some health issues like
                            bronchitis, pneumonia, and sinus infections. Her children are now
                            worried about her being sick as well. Heather would never take back
                            anything that she did during her time working at the WTC site, but she
                            still doesn’t want to be sick.

       David was a Project Executive with IBM Corporation, taking over and
                            managing the IT work flow and networking for major corporations. On
                            September 11th, David and his wife were in West Palm Beach Florida
                            caring for his dad, and helping to get him back into his own home after
                            surgery. They were told about the events by a friend of his fathers, and
                            turned on the television just after the first plane had hit. He felt
                            totally alone and was afraid for his children, two of whom were in
                            Manhattan. He wanted to be a positive force as part of the rebuilding.
                            He was brought up to be a caring person. He could smell the smoke at his
                            home all the way out in Bellmore, NY, and couldn’t sit doing nothing. He
                            felt strongly that he would roll up his sleeves and participate, to do
                            what was right in his gut. He first volunteered with the Salvation Army
                            at the end of October helping children who had lost a parent in the
                            disaster. The kids broke his heart. The sadness on the kid’s faces was
                            overwhelming; their emotions far exceeded anything he could have done
                            for them. The kids did eventually smile, when given a gift, and this
                            touched his heart. He felt close to the kids, it felt good to give them
                            a glimmer of joy. When David’s time working with the kids came to an
                            end, he signed up to go to Ground Zero. He would drive to Manhattan on
                            Friday nights, arriving at Ground Zero between 9 and 10pm and staying
                            overnight until 7 or 8am – this was his routine every Friday for six
                            months. It was surreal approaching Ground Zero the first time. He drove
                            his own car, taking the route he would usually take to Manhattan, and
                            there were police on the Brooklyn Bridge, patrols watching the cars.
                            Generators, spot lights, police barricades, rubble – it no longer felt
                            like Manhattan. It felt like a bombed out war zone. Everything was grey,
                            ash covered everything. He saw trucks, police cars, firefighter trucks
                            all smashed like toy trucks. His job at Ground Zero was to take care of
                            the firefighters, police, and National Guard who were guarding the
                            perimeter. They would bring candy and hot chocolate to the responders,
                            making sure they were comfortable. He had a hard hat that he asked the
                            responders he worked with to sign. He is very proud of this hat, and has
                            it on display in his home till this day. David and his wife were given
                            tickets to attend the 9/11 Memorial. When approaching the Memorial,
                            there appeared to be protesters and he wondered why anyone would
                            protest. As they got closer, they realized that the crowds of people
                            were not protesting - they were thanking the responders for their work
                            at Ground Zero. He became emotional, and said it was the best gift he
                            could have ever been given.

       On 9/11/2001, John was employed by a large printer company, and worked as
                            technician installing and servicing their equipment. He had previous
                            training with the Red Cross, and volunteered as a Disaster Assistance
                            Technician for five weeks during the Rescue and Recovery efforts post
                            9/11. As he recalled all the events, his vivid memories still made him
                            emotional, but he is proud of his time served. His only regret was not
                            wearing his respirator “at all times”. That morning, John was in
                            Northport on his way to a job site, when he heard on the radio that a
                            plane hit one of the towers. He found that to be odd because of his
                            aviation knowledge and knew that it was an “impossible feat for two
                            planes, to hit two buildings within minutes of each other”. After seeing
                            the footage on a portable TV, he knew it was no accident. John’s
                            employer allowed him to leave work early, and he returned home where he
                            lived alone with his dog in Huntington, LI. He can still remember the
                            burnt scent in the air, even though he was 40 miles away from Ground
                            Zero. He was also able to see the plume of smoke that emerged from the
                            site. John’s immediate response to this catastrophe was being compelled
                            to do whatever he could to help. He learned that due to Red Cross
                            politics, because his local chapter (Nassau-Suffolk) wasn’t “invited” to
                            go to Ground Zero, then he could not serve there, so he went on his own
                            with his Red Cross ID. On 9/13/11, he took the LIRR and subway to Canal
                            Street, and preceded on foot the “Dead Zone”. His first visual memory
                            coming up the stairs of the subway station is a black car covered with
                            gray dust with “Bin Laden Die” written by finger (of which he has a
                            picture of). He describes the first few days of the rescue effort as
                            “organized chaos”. He would work at his day job, then volunteer from 4pm
                            to sunrise, return home to sleep for a few hours and return the next
                            day, and continued this schedule for five weeks. Only police, fire,
                            ironworkers and special agencies were allowed on “the pile,” so John was
                            only allowed to work the perimeter. He stationed himself with the local
                            Red Cross truck that was parked at the South Tower. One of the most
                            important jobs he had, being a dog lover, was helping the “Sniffer
                            Dogs”. Their paws needed protection from the heat of the pile, eyewash
                            from the gray dust and food and water. If the workers or dogs thought
                            they found any signs of life, they would blow the air horn three times,
                            then all equipment would shut down and they would wait to hopefully hear
                            something. When Rescue changed to Recovery, John assisted the workers
                            who were on the extension ladder trucks spraying water on Building 7,
                            because it was a “hot spot”. John would also retrieve cigarettes for the
                            ironworkers who would request specific brands (i.e.: Marlboro, Pall
                            Mall, Winston). While John was volunteering, he managed to fracture his
                            foot. Then in February of 2002, John was diagnosed with severe GERD,
                            which affected his singing voice. Then in 2013, was diagnosed with lung
                            cancer. Since he has lived his life as a vegetarian for the past 40
                            years, is a non-smoker, non-drinker, and is a physically fit runner, he
                            and his doctors are convinced that his diagnoses are directly associated
                            with the grey and black dust that surrounded him while he volunteered.
                            He knew the EPA was constantly monitoring the air, and although the
                            authorities stated the air quality was “adequate”, there was also an
                            “array of chemicals that could not be identified”. Luckily, he has been
                            able to successfully be treated for both conditions, and is doing well.
                            John’s entire experience has showed him “how well humans work together
                            under duress”. He did not make any long term friendships from his time
                            there, but was proud of the comradery that everyone displayed. He
                            realizes that many people in the world do not like the United States,
                            and we should “practice what we preach”.

       Glenn was a NYPD Officer on 9/11 and is currently with Suffolk County PD.
                            Even though he was the first in his family to become a police officer,
                            he has two brothers who are police officers and another brother who was
                            a firefighter. All of them were in these positions during 9/11. On the
                            day of the attacks, Glenn was called into work. Before leaving his home
                            in Nesconset, Long Island, he gathered all his important documents that
                            he had locked up and gave them to his wife, not knowing what he was
                            getting himself into. As he was driving in towards NYC, he saw the cloud
                            of smoke from the Long Island Expressway in Melville (Route 110). One of
                            the things that he always remembered when getting to his precinct was
                            seeing the officers coming off the previous shift. There weren’t as many
                            guys that day coming off their shift. Glenn and his fellow officers were
                            transported to the South Street Seaport. He wasn’t too familiar downtown
                            Manhattan, and as he was by the WTC area, he saw a building that was
                            about 6 stories high at that point, which kind of had the outside peeled
                            off. He originally thought that this was one of the towers, but found
                            out that this was really 7 WTC. The whole area was like a “movie set”.
                            While at Ground Zero, when they sounded the horns three times, it meant
                            that there was there was an adjacent building that was unstable and may
                            collapse. The horns meant they were supposed to run away from the area
                            due to the possibility of the nearby building coming down, and Glenn
                            recalls his colleague running so fast that his shoes literally came off.
                            He was part of the bucket brigade lines, trying to find body parts. He
                            was there when they found the last person alive; the person was filled
                            with dust and everyone clapped as he was lifted out. This gave Glenn a
                            sense of purpose to his work down there. Any body parts that were found
                            were treated with dignity. As the effort changed to recovery, there were
                            tons of photos of loved ones posted on the security fences for the
                            responders to try and find. They would try to find anything, body parts
                            or material belongings, to bring some type of closure for loved ones;
                            there was a lot riding on what they were doing there in terms of
                            recovery. He once found a note “Son’s Little League Game at 7 O'clock”.
                            He personalized this, not knowing if the person was alive or not, and
                            imagined the father going to the kids baseball game with his tie and
                            suite jacket off after a long day of work or not showing up. He knew
                            personalizing these things was a dangerous thing to do, but it’s what he
                            did. Glenn says that it was difficult to see that many body part; he’s
                            never seen so many and hopes he never does again. There was a change in
                            viewpoint towards NYPD Officers during this time by the public. This was
                            nice because people actually respected them as police officers and this
                            also pushed him during this time. Three years prior to 9/11, Glenn
                            studied Criminal Justice and minored in Psychology in college. That gave
                            him the education to be part of POPPA (Police Officers Providing Peer
                            Assistance) and MAP (Members Assistance Program). He talked with fellow
                            officers about their experiences for therapeutic purposes. This was
                            difficult but helped many officers tremendously. Glenn lost a friend of
                            his from work, Tommy Langone, from NYPD ESU, and his Glenn’s brother,
                            FDNY Firefighter, just recently passed away from 9/11 related
                            illness(es). Today, Glenn appreciates the little things in life like the
                            changing of seasons and doesn’t worry about the things that are out of
                            his control. Glenn ends off by saying, “Mean what you say and say what
                            you mean.”

       Joseph was a Verizon Field Engineer on 9/11/2001 and worked the midtown
                            Manhattan area. He wasn’t with Verizon for too long and was only 26
                            years old but worked his way up the organization quickly and held this
                            supervising position. Joseph recalls that Tuesday morning being a clear
                            day and hearing a news reporter saying, “It was a good day to fly” early
                            in the morning before the towers were hit. Later in the morning (still
                            early), they were listening to the Howard Stern Show on the radio and he
                            heard tons of sirens out his window. He eventually heard something in
                            regards to what was happening at the WTC, and he went up to the roof of
                            his midtown Manhattan building with a colleague to get a first-hand look
                            at what was happening. Joseph got up to the roof after the 1st plane hit
                            and witnessed the first tower collapsing. When they went back
                            downstairs, it was very chaotic as people were finding out what was
                            happening. He was initially advised to help with setting up a triage
                            center at Bryant Park, but they quickly realized that there wouldn’t be
                            much use for the triage center. He got asked if he would stay the night
                            to help with whatever was needed in terms of communications. He agreed
                            to do it. Later in the day on 9/11/2001, he took a Verizon Van with his
                            colleague (which he would never be allowed to do if it weren’t a
                            disaster of this magnitude) and drove down to the Verizon building at
                            140 West Street. Joseph says it was like a movie scene down by the WTC
                            area. No one was around, which was very atypical of the area and
                            Manhattan in general. The building they were staying at, 140 West
                            Street, was completely damaged since it was adjacent to the towers. They
                            had a bunch of underground equipment at this location that was all
                            damaged. There was a layer of dust covering everything and they didn’t
                            have any respirators or masks to wear. Joseph snagged a piece of paper
                            that was within all the debris. It was part of a Stock Broker’s Manual
                            and was page number “9-11”. He still has this paper to this day (see
                            picture attached to Joseph’s interview). Joseph stayed the night with an
                            impromptu bed that they rigged up. At times, he wasn’t sure exactly what
                            he was supposed to be doing down there. Eventually, Joseph worked on
                            getting the stock market back up and running. He drew the plans for the
                            fiber optic wiring that the stock market needed. He understood the
                            importance of this for the economy but was still a little discouraged
                            that this was such a priority. Joseph also setup a command post at the
                            front of FDNY 10 Engine – 10 Truck. At this point, he was wearing a
                            white Tyvek suit, but still no respirator. Joseph is now an FDNY
                            Firefighter and has been for 10 years now. He talks about the decision
                            of leaving his job at Verizon to be a firefighter with the FDNY; he saw
                            all that the firefighters did on 9/11 and probably wouldn’t have decided
                            to become a firefighter if he not had this experience at the WTC site
                            during 9/11.

       Marcelo Gallina oral history

       Marcelo was an officer with the NYPD working in midtown Manhattan on
                            9/11/2001, on what he calls a beautiful morning. At the time of the
                            attacks, he was writing a traffic ticket for a minor infraction when he
                            heard on the radio that a plane had crashed downtown. As it turns out,
                            he was writing the ticket at the exact moment the first plane hit; he
                            keeps that ticket as a memento to this day. Although his first instinct
                            was to rush to the scene, his partner convinced him to stay and wait for
                            orders. They were soon recalled to the station, where Marcelo was
                            assigned to assist in the evacuation of the Empire State Building, one
                            of many public landmarks located within the precinct. During this job,
                            he recalls hearing the voice of officer Morris Smith calling for help
                            from within the towers: “She was basically dying on the radio… She did
                            what we all wanted to do, and she paid with her life.” Although he was
                            not at the World Trade Center on 9/11, he watched one of the towers fall
                            from the steps of the New York City Post Office. The next day, he was
                            assigned to site security detail, stopping passersby and onlookers from
                            getting too near to the pile. At the site, there were several buildings
                            that were still standing but could fall at any moment. If they were
                            going to fall, a horn would sound, and anyone in the area had to run for
                            their lives. Marcelo recalls being more scared than he had ever been
                            before when he heard one of those horns sound and he began to run; to
                            this day he hasn’t been as scared as in that moment. Marcelo worked at
                            Ground Zero every few days; on the other days, he rotated between other
                            site security details, protecting religious institutions and other
                            sensitive areas. For him, it’s the memories of the little things that
                            stick with him the most. For instance, he remembers seeing fighter jets
                            flying over Manhattan in the days following the attacks, and entering
                            the wrong tent at Ground Zero and seeing firefighters’ oxygen tanks
                            completely melted and burned. He still keeps in touch with several
                            people whom he worked with at the site, and they rarely talk about 9/11
                            anymore. For them, it’s also about the little things, like the comfort
                            centers that were set up at St. John’s and a nearby Marriott. Marcelo
                            also explicitly mentions that one of his closest friends passed away in
                            2005 due to 9/11-related illness. He also singles out culture of police
                            officers and firefighters to “put on a tough exterior” despite their
                            anguish as something that is changing and must continue to change.
                            Marcelo believes the world has been changed by the attacks, especially
                            the United States. “Just go to an airport and tell me things aren’t
                            different now,” he says. He sees himself as having been a very small
                            part of a world-changing event, and hopes that the world will become a
                            better place as we learn lessons from the attacks and their aftermath.

       Robert, a veteran of the Vietnam War, was working in his office in
                            midtown Manhattan on 9/11/2001. When the first plane hit, he didn’t
                            think much of it, believing it to be a small plane accident. Once he
                            realized that it was an attack, he made sure that everyone who depended
                            on him would be safe and taken care of. He and his company made
                            arrangements for their employees to stay in hotels, then he made his way
                            uptown to take his daughter out of school. A coworker was able to take
                            them via back roads out of New York City to their home in Westchester
                            County. The next morning, Robert saw Mayor Giuliani’s call for
                            volunteers who knew first aid and went into the city to volunteer. On
                            his way to the Javits Center, he saw a sign for the Salvation Army
                            requesting volunteers and signed up with them instead. When they arrived
                            at Ground Zero, he was immediately struck by the odor in the air, which
                            he likened to the poison gas the US Army would use to flush out Viet
                            Cong members before he and his men would drop into the jungles. During
                            those operations, they wore full gas masks, so the paper painter’s masks
                            that they were issued were simply not good enough in his view. He
                            received a full gas mask from a departing federal agent, which he wore
                            the whole time he was there. Robert spent two full days on site, handing
                            out water, ice, and food to responders who needed them. During that
                            time, he never stopped to sleep, although he did take breaks every so
                            often. He felt his training in the armed forces prepared him for the
                            stress of being among the wreckage, and was disturbed not merely because
                            such a heinous act had occurred, but because it had occurred in the
                            United States. Robert empathizes with and respects the first responders
                            that are now suffering from health problems simply from doing their
                            jobs, because he himself contracted cancer from the Agent Orange
                            chemical agent during his time in Vietnam. He doesn’t see himself as a
                            hero for responding to the events of 9/11 as he did, but rather sees
                            that response as a “natural instinct of helping.” He believes that, in
                            the future, the safety of civil servants should be a higher priority for
                            the government, should such an event befall the country again.

       Joseph was a captain in the New York Department of Corrections, working
                            at headquarters at 60 Hudson Street, on 9/11/2001. He was at work when
                            one of his co-workers told him that a plane had flown into the World
                            Trade Center. At that time, he notes, nobody was really sure what had
                            happened or why; it wasn’t until much later that he became aware that
                            the events were part of an attack. Joseph is one of the only members of
                            his family who is involved in law enforcement, and believes that his
                            training as a correctional officer is how he was able to run to the site
                            of the attacks and suppress his fear to offer help to people who needed
                            him. When an alarm is sounded in a prison, he said, correctional
                            officers must run toward the alarm, not away, and be prepared to face
                            whatever they find, no matter how dangerous or frightening. On the day
                            of the attacks, Joseph, his boss, and two of his subordinates made their
                            way to the towers. Joseph remembers the “white noise” of people
                            screaming and the sight of people jumping from the windows as the towers
                            burned. Although one of his officers told him to not look up, Joseph
                            couldn’t help but watch. In his own words, “how could [I] not?” Even
                            today, if he closes his eyes, he can still see the image of those people
                            falling from the windows. After a little time had passed, the first
                            tower began to fall. That moment, he recalls, was one where he truly
                            felt afraid for his life, because he couldn’t see the tower and was
                            afraid that it might crush him and everyone he was with. Additionally,
                            although he does not remember many sounds from that day besides “white
                            noise,” he does recall one specific sound from that tower collapsing: a
                            sound akin to a metal pot being dropped onto the floor. He suggests that
                            the sound was the sound of the top of the building hitting the ground.
                            He and his colleagues ducked into an elementary school soon thereafter,
                            where the children were lined in up rows of two by the teachers, whom he
                            recalled were “scared” but “extraordinary.” They helped evacuate the
                            school, then made their way back outside and moved closer to where the
                            towers stood. They then assisted with the evacuation of a brick building
                            next to 5 World Trade Center, collaborating with the FDNY to clear out
                            people on the upper floors who had broken out their windows. After this,
                            two of his colleagues went back to 60 Hudson, and he remained with one
                            of his officers. They then ran across a man on the street and helped
                            evacuate him and his family from their nearby second-floor apartment. He
                            also recalls a man who was trying to cross the police line and enter the
                            enclosed area on West Broadway to find his wife. The man was insistent
                            that he must enter the fray to look for her, despite Joseph telling him
                            that he was not allowed through. Eventually, Joseph told him, “Nobody’s
                            down there. We got everybody out. Your wife is somewhere, on her way
                            home. I know she is.” To this day, he still wonders if that man went
                            home to his wife. Another aspect that he will always remember is the
                            “smell of death” that lingered in the air throughout the day, a smell
                            which he first experienced as a 16-year-old. Joseph does not
                            characterize himself as a “talking” kind of person, so he has spent a
                            lot of time trying to come to grips with the events of 9/11 on his own.
                            That day, on his way back to HQ after the events described above, he sat
                            in a park just above the Hudson/W Broadway split for 10 minutes “just to
                            get a grip on what happened.” In the years since, he has kept a journal
                            that he only shared with one other person in thirteen years. His last
                            entry was on the tenth anniversary of the attacks, three years ago.
                            Today, he is grateful for and more appreciative of what he has than he
                            was before the attacks, and wishes more of the world would take the same
                            perspective – as they did, in his eyes, in the days and months
                            immediately following the attacks. That, he says, would be his message
                            to the world in the aftermath of 9/11/2001.

       Donald was a reporter for Bloomberg News Radio assigned to the New York
                            Stock Exchange on 9/11/2001. Every morning, on his way to work, he would
                            pass the World Trade Center and look up to the sky near the south tower.
                            He remembers that it was a beautiful, cloudless day when he passed the
                            towers, and had no sense of what was to come. When the first plane hit,
                            he was told to leave his post at NYSE and investigate the “fire” that
                            was happening at the north tower. As soon as he left NYSE, Donald
                            noticed sheets of paper raining down from the sky, and pigeons lying
                            dead all along the sidewalk. He was watching the World Trade Center when
                            a loud crack – the loudest noise he had ever heard – heralded a second
                            explosion in the south tower. He still did not realize that a plane had
                            hit either building, and was just trying to make sense of the situation.
                            Some time later, while he was continuing to observe the scene, the south
                            tower began to fall. Donald was swept along in the herd of people
                            running away from the collapsing tower, and ended up in the cellar of a
                            building at 2 Wall Street, where the janitorial staff was shepherding
                            the confused and chaotic crowd. He calls these janitors “unsung heroes”
                            of 9/11. He also recalls several women who had fallen in their high
                            heels as they were running, and the men who stopped to pick them up and
                            take their shoes off so they could continue running. Two memories from
                            that day continue to haunt Donald: suggesting that everyone in the north
                            tower was “probably dead” to a colleague and friend whose brother worked
                            in the building, and coming across and kicking a dead body from the
                            wreckage of the plane because it was covered in dust and he didn’t know
                            what it was. Aside from these two memories, he chooses to put all
                            memories of that day and its aftermath out of his head. The next day, he
                            was assigned to report from the piers; however, he instead snuck past
                            the security checkpoints to report from Ground Zero. For the next ten
                            days, he reported from the area, before being recalled to the newsroom.
                            About a week later, he lost his voice due to damage to his throat from
                            breathing the toxic air at Ground Zero. Still, he would do it all again
                            if he had to, because he sees 9/11 as the biggest and most important
                            story of his career. Donald does not see many positives in the events of
                            9/11, although he does speak positively about the compassion and unity
                            that he perceived in people immediately following the attacks. He
                            believes that New York City handled the recovery well, but is somewhat
                            critical of state and federal responses to the attacks and their roles
                            in rebuilding and memorializing the event. He says he has no idea how
                            9/11 will be remembered, but hopes that will never be forgotten

       Daniel was an Emergency Manager for Con Edison on 9/11/2001. He was
                            called to the World Trade Center shortly after the first plane had hit,
                            tasked with assessing the situation and restoring the power that had
                            been lost to the North Tower. He vividly describes the mass chaos on the
                            scene when he arrived. He decided to enter the North Tower and attempt
                            to isolate its power from the rest of the area to get about restoring
                            it, but firemen were preventing people from nearing the building. Daniel
                            recalls, to this day, the faces of those who were jumping from the
                            building at the time. Whenever he thinks of the event, he recalls a
                            couple holding hands and jumping; he remembers the man’s tie in such
                            great detail that he can still picture it. While he was standing,
                            helpless, the second plane hit, and he knew that they were under attack.
                            During the confusion of that moment, he remembers seeing the towers
                            burning “white,” and thinking that nobody was going to be able to get up
                            there to save anybody. He was in the midst of both towers when they
                            fell, and both times he recalls running faster and farther than he ever
                            had in his life. When a third building began to collapse, he was unable
                            to run, so he was picked up by an ambulance and whisked away. Only a few
                            hours later, he was back on the scene surveying the damage and looking
                            to help however he could. For the next three days, Daniel worked without
                            rest to supervise his teams in isolating Ground Zero from the power grid
                            and getting the New York Stock Exchange back up and running. He
                            continued working 16-hour days until March 2002 to restore power to the
                            area; he recalls that they used all of the materials that were available
                            in the entire country during this effort, and had to import supplies
                            from around the world just to get the job done. Daniel says he counts
                            his blessings every day that he’s still alive, because of all the people
                            that were lost in the 9/11 attacks. One person whom he particularly
                            remembers is Jimmy Jones, a fellow ConEd worker who died of Hammond
                            Ricks Syndrome as a result of exposure to toxic air during the 9/11
                            restoration efforts. Daniel wishes that the utility workers who were
                            there every day after the attacks, such as his friend Jimmy, could be
                            remembered with the same respect as is afforded to other first
                            responders. Although he has some physical health issues because of his
                            response, Daniel says he would do everything exactly the same if he had
                            to go through it again. He says that compassion for people is what
                            drives him to do what he does. After 9/11, Daniel helped with the
                            restoration efforts after two other major catastrophes: Hurricane
                            Katrina in New Orleans, and Hurricane Sandy in New York. Despite the
                            magnitude of destruction and loss from both of these disasters, the
                            events of 9/11 still stand alone in his memory. Daniel believes that
                            every American should always remember the attacks on 9/11. He was very
                            moved by the way New Yorkers rallied in the aftermath of the attacks to
                            support the first responders, but worries that people have forgotten the
                            attacks because of how far away the fighting is today. He wishes that
                            every American would think more about how the country acts in the world,
                            and believes that every civilian life lost in both the US and in the
                            Middle East is a tragedy deserving of respect.

       Peter was a member of the US Air Force Reserve on 9/11/2001. Immediately
                            upon seeing the footage of the World Trade Center after the first plane
                            hit, he felt that there was something wrong. After the second impact, he
                            knew that the events of that morning were an “act of something.” He
                            immediately knew that he would be called upon to serve in some capacity,
                            and by 9:30 he had received a call that he was needed. He and his
                            executive officer (an Air Force term for an administrative assistant to
                            a senior officer) drove into the city in what Peter called a “silence of
                            war” to meet up with FEMA at 26 Federal Plaza. En route, he saw the
                            towers collapse. Later that day, when Building 7 collapsed, he was in
                            the city and saw that collapse as well. Peter describes the military’s
                            role in FEMA as providing support to the civilian members of the
                            organization, who take the lead on emergency response. His job, he says,
                            was to provide support until things could go back to normal – what he
                            calls “providing continuity” of government and administration. However,
                            at the time of the attack, there was a FEMA conference that all the
                            civilian officials were attending, leaving only the military officers to
                            take the lead on the emergency response. Peter’s tour at Ground Zero was
                            seven consecutive days, the first three of which he spent on his feet.
                            During this time, he helped re-establish communications with Washington,
                            assess the situation on the ground – how much of the operation was
                            search and rescue, how much was recovery – and anticipate and fulfill
                            the needs of emergency responders and government officials at the site.
                            On Thursday, 9/13, Peter was tasked with securing the president, who was
                            on his way to Ground Zero by helicopter. He recalls standing with the
                            president after his arrival, and seeing that the leader’s presence was a
                            great inspiration for everyone. Another leader whom he admires for her
                            presence at that time was then-Senator Hillary Clinton. He describes her
                            as being a very comforting and respectable presence on the work site,
                            inspiring and easing the minds of the men and women working there. His
                            final day responding was 9/17, when he went to the FEMA office and was
                            asked if he had a temporary badge. When he saw that bureaucracy had
                            returned, he believed that things had returned back to normal. Because
                            of that, he said that his job responding to 9/11 was done. Peter calls
                            himself apolitical. For him, the story of the September 11th attacks and
                            their aftermath is a story of the beauty of humanity. He tells the story
                            of a Saudi cab driver that drove him and two of his colleagues from a
                            hotel down to 14th Street on one of the nights immediately following the
                            attacks. The driver, upon seeing the three of them in uniform, began to
                            cry and apologize for the acts of his countrymen. The three of them, in
                            turn, reassured him that it was OK. That drive left an indelible mark in
                            his mind, because the four men, despite their wildly different
                            backgrounds, could all sit together and tell each other, sincerely, that
                            things would be OK. Watching the response effort, he says, showed him
                            the beauty of humanity even more clearly. Peter is a spiritual man who
                            believes that God provides every human with free will. Sometimes, he
                            says, people use that free will to hurt others. For him, what defines
                            everyone is what happens next: “how we handle after someone exerts their
                            free will” to inflict pain. What he saw at Ground Zero – people of all
                            backgrounds, races, religions, and political beliefs helping to save
                            what lives they could and provide closure for the lives they couldn’t –
                            was enough to support the belief in humanity that he carries with him to
                            this day. Peter was a member of the US Air Force Reserve on 9/11/2001.
                            Immediately upon seeing the footage of the World Trade Center after the
                            first plane hit, he felt that there was something wrong. After the
                            second impact, he knew that the events of that morning were an “act of
                            something.” He immediately knew that he would be called upon to serve in
                            some capacity, and by 9:30 he had received a call that he was needed. He

                            assistant to a senior officer) drove into the city in what Peter called

       Barry started work, as normal on that day at 7:30am. He worked for the
                            MTA NYC Transit Environmental Engineering Department. While he was at
                            his desk on the 2nd floor of 2 Broadway, he heard that a plane had hit
                            one of the towers. Upon further investigation, he was informed that a
                            Piper Cub plane had crashed into the North Tower. He wondered. “How much
                            damage could a small plane do to that huge building?” A short while
                            later he heard that the North Tower was on fire. From his floor, he
                            listened. “All you could hear were the Fire and Police sirens.” He was
                            curious, so he and many of his co-workers went outside, across the
                            street to Battery Park to see what was really going on. He could see
                            that the North Tower was in fact, on fire. “You could see the North
                            Tower on fire and papers floating in the air. The building was burning
                            really bad and we knew right then that it was not a Piper Cub plane that
                            hit this huge building but rather a large plane,” he said. While
                            watching the building from Battery Park, he heard the second plane
                            flying over the water by the Castle Clinton Nation Monument and the
                            Statue of Liberty boat dock. It was the second American Airlines plane.
                            “It was flying really low and slow,” he noted. “As I watched the plane
                            go by, I could see the people in the plane looking at us on the ground,
                            not knowing what was about to happen. As the plane’s engines roared, the
                            plane lifted up and banked right towards the World Trade Center’s South
                            Tower, he remembered. “I will never forget that sight and sound as long
                            as I live.” “Then I saw something fall. It was a person,” he recalled.
                            Then he saw another, and another still. “They just could not hold on.
                            More and more people had no choice but to jump to their deaths or burn
                            alive.” Barry and his co-workers tried to direct the mobs of people
                            running to the Bowling Green Subway Station. He could see the large
                            cloud of white smoke and dust approaching them. Barry returned to his
                            office at 2 Broadway. He had a working cell phone which he shared with
                            the Firefighters so that they could call home to tell their loved ones
                            that they were alive. He stayed and handed out water. When Barry
                            returned the next morning, he worked on the “pile,” looking for
                            survivors. He would work on that “pile” for 16 to 18 hours a day. There
                            were scary moments,” Barry remembers. The buildings and the grounds were
                            unstable. There were alarms sounding every time a body was found. “This
                            will haunt me until the day I die” he said.

       John was working for the New York City Department of Investigation on
                            9/11/2001, although he was not at work at the time of the attacks. He
                            first heard of the first plane on the Howard Stern show, at which point
                            officials were still reporting the incident as an accident involving a
                            small plane. Once he knew it was something more, though, he felt an urge
                            to go down to the World Trade Center and help however he could. He
                            recalls walking along Worth Street towards Broadway; the streets were
                            empty, and he was literally alone as he walked. He began the day
                            standing by at a triage center, waiting to transport people to the
                            hospital. When news came that hospitals weren’t accepting any more
                            patients, he left. Eventually, he made his way to the 13th precinct, and
                            he went down to Ground Zero shortly thereafter. That day, however, he
                            did not get a chance to help at the site. On his way home, he saw his
                            father-in-law walking toward the Brooklyn Bridge; he picked him up and
                            took him home. The next day, John remained home and awaited orders. On
                            Thursday, he went with some NYPD colleagues to an impromptu headquarters
                            located in a Burger King to receive protective equipment. He was
                            assigned to work the bucket brigade, a job which entailed 12-hour shifts
                            with few breaks. John was on the bucket brigade for two weeks before he
                            summoned back to the Department of Investigation to get back to work. At
                            that time, he still wanted to stay and help. For the next two years at
                            DOI, he was able to continue focusing on the attacks: he investigated
                            city workers who had applied for compensation for losing their jobs as a
                            result of the attacks to catch fraudulent claims. For John, the urge to
                            help in the aftermath of the attacks was so strong and so innate that he
                            struggles to explain it. He is grateful for the job he was assigned
                            after returning to his regular job, because he couldn’t have seen
                            himself doing any work that didn’t somehow help the 9/11 recovery
                            efforts. In his mind, every single responder – and every one of their
                            supporters – went “above and beyond” in the days following the attacks.
                            These days, John doesn’t think about or discuss the attacks very much.
                            He recalls the feelings of his father, who had served in Vietnam but
                            rarely discussed it, when describing his desire to “put away” the
                            memories of the attacks and his service instead of reliving them.

       On 9/11/2001, Ulysses, who prefers the name Peter, was a social worker
                            splitting his time between the John Heuss House homeless shelter and the
                            Stanton Street transitional house for the mentally ill. Both of these
                            locations were very close to Ground Zero, so the people he served were
                            very acutely affected by the attacks and their aftermath. Peter
                            remembers an atmosphere of foreboding and panic in the neighborhood
                            immediately following the attacks. Many people left either voluntarily
                            or as a result of evacuation, but Peter knew that he wouldn’t leave the
                            people at John Heuss and Stanton houses behind. “These are my people,”
                            he says. “If they’re not going, I’m not going.” Because nobody from the
                            outer boroughs could come into work for many days following 9/11, he and
                            a few other colleagues kept the facilities up and running. In the
                            ensuing weeks, he recalls that many of the people in these houses broke
                            down from the stress of the attack. For instance, he tells a story of a
                            young man who attacked a Muslim person whom he encountered on the
                            street; Peter and his colleagues had to take him aside and explain that
                            such behavior was unacceptable and misguided. Aside from incidents like
                            these, it was mostly business as usual for Peter. John Heuss House took
                            in many homeless people who had been set up around Ground Zero. Peter
                            speaks very highly of these individuals’ strength and fortitude in the
                            face of such terrible tragedy. Many of them were right next to the
                            building at the time of the attack, and had to watch as people jumping
                            from the windows above landed right in front of them. He specifically
                            recalls five homeless residents who volunteered at Ground Zero, using
                            their previously learned skills to reintegrate into a society that had
                            left them behind for a brief time. Peter believes that the homeless in
                            New York are often forgotten when considering the aftermath of the
                            attacks, and tells their stories in hopes that it can get them the care
                            that they need. Peter has experienced a number of health problems since
                            9/11, although he isn’t certain that they are a direct result of his
                            working in the area after the attacks. He is now out of work on
                            disability, after 9 years of worsening respiratory problems and
                            infections throughout his body. Today, he suffers from GERD and
                            sometimes throws up blood. Peter recalls the days after 9/11 being a
                            time when “the best of New York came out.” For him, the kindness people
                            showed toward one another and the respect they showed for life were
                            beautiful and important. Although he has no desire to see another
                            tragedy like 9/11, he wishes the city could turn back the clock toward
                            that mentality.

       Carol was born in Massachusetts but always wanted to come and live in
                            NYC. She came to Columbia University for graduate school and settled in
                            Greenwich Village in 1967. Her first job was as a Medical Social Worker.
                            She went into private practice in 1990 and is still practicing. She
                            trained with FEMA for Critical Incident work and has worked with all
                            populations, from gang members to high level philanthropic persons. She
                            never thought she’d use the FEMA training to the extent that she has. On
                            September 11, she was up at 8:45 getting ready for work. She heard the
                            impact and smelled the smoke, but thought it was an accident. As the
                            towers were going down, she and her neighbors went out into the street,
                            terrified that there would be more attacks. Slowly they learned of
                            neighbors who were hurt and as the day went on, people didn’t come home.
                            Carol was asked to work as close to the pile as they would let her, to
                            be accessible to the First Responders and to assess their ability to
                            keep working. Some would come voluntarily to see the councilors, and
                            some would be ordered in by supervisors. She assessed the responders for
                            mania, panic, and breakdowns. Although it is the nature of the
                            responders to stay and work, it was such a military atmosphere that
                            there was no question: if your supervisor told you to go home to rest,
                            you went. The responders were trying to keep themselves strong and Carol
                            didn’t want to take down their defenses. They didn’t want to talk about
                            it. The councilors were treating them ‘in the moment’, reduced to basics
                            – food, medical needs – and letting the future take care of itself.
                            Hundreds passed through the tents, either to talk or to just rest. There
                            were around the clock social workers, medical staff and first aid
                            available. After a week or two, she was transferred to the Saint Vincent
                            Family Center where there was a huge auditorium set up with two tables.
                            One table was for anyone who came in to get help, and the other table
                            was for people looking for loved ones. Her job was counselling people
                            for anxiety and grief counseling. It was like the Book of Job: There
                            wasn’t anything you could do for them, you couldn’t fix it, no words
                            were smart enough; you just had to be with them. The Family Center
                            stayed open a long time. Dust permeated everywhere, even in the
                            Greenwich area. Dust was in her apartment, it sneaks in everywhere. The
                            government offered air filters and air conditioners. Carol remembers
                            that first weekend when it rained for the first time since the attack.
                            All the pictures were swept away and they realized there was no more
                            hope for survivors.

       Richard was a mental health trainer in 2001. On 9/11, he was teaching a
                            class to veteran police officers in New Jersey at the time of the
                            attacks. At the time, they knew that two planes had hit the towers, but
                            knew nothing about the severity of the attacks. It was only after a few
                            police officers had checked on their families and learned that the
                            Pentagon had also been hit that the magnitude of the 9/11 attacks became
                            clear. He canceled the class and began to drive home. Richard has two
                            children; at the time, one was in elementary school and one was in high
                            school. While the latter had learned of the attacks at school, the
                            former was completely in the dark about it. He describes the difficulty
                            of explaining the attacks to a young child, of making sure to find words
                            that could explain the situation without being too graphic or upsetting.
                            As a member of a crisis response network, Richard knew he would be
                            called upon to help. In the ensuing days, he provided debriefing and
                            counseling for individuals who witnessed the attacks and to families of
                            those who had died. He undertook this latter role at the New Jersey
                            Family Assistance Center at Liberty State Park. At first, there were
                            very few people who sought counseling; it was only after death
                            certificates were issued that he began seeing many people. Richard
                            engaged in what he calls “compassionate lurking” during his time at the
                            Family Assistance Center. Rather than waiting for individuals to come to
                            him seeking counseling, he would walk around the area and seek those
                            individuals himself. In addition to this on-the-ground counseling work,
                            he coordinated new counselors who arrived disoriented and confused. He
                            knew he wanted to help as much as he could, for as long as he could. The
                            only thing he didn’t want to do was actually go to see Ground Zero.
                            Despite this, Richard was on the very first boat to take families across
                            the river to the site. When he arrived, he found a world almost entirely
                            devoid of color; the only parts that were not grey were the construction
                            equipment and the hazmat suits. Although he still did not want to see
                            Ground Zero, he pressed on because he felt it was his job: he was there
                            to help and support the families, and that’s what he would do. In total,
                            Richard went on 16 of these boat trips. He realized that there was a
                            healing quality to them. On the rides back, there was sometimes even
                            laughter among the family members, and that sustained him. Knowing that
                            there was a positive result to the work that he and his colleagues were
                            doing was enough to keep him going. He stayed on at the Family
                            Assistance Center until the end of October, at which point he went back
                            to work. The events of 9/11 still affect him today. Occasionally, he
                            experiences flashbacks to his time at the Family Assistance Center, and
                            he maintains close personal relationships with several people he met at
                            the time. His experiences, especially the experiences on the boat trips,
                            had a huge impact on him, both temporally – he describes with pride the
                            camaraderie he felt with his fellow responders – and spiritually. He
                            believes that the way people came together after 9/11 is special and
                            should always be remembered long after the events have faded into
                            history.

       Kathryn was working as a bureaucrat with the New Jersey Mental Health
                            Administration on 9/11/01. That day, however, she was on vacation,
                            planning to have lunch at Windows on the World, a restaurant atop the
                            World Trade Center. When she saw the news that a plane had hit the World
                            Trade Center, she immediately knew that she would be there in some
                            capacity. In her words, “it was just a question of when.” She worked at
                            Liberty State Park starting on 9/13, picking up whatever odd jobs were
                            needed of her – she gives the examples of corralling therapy dogs and
                            changing toilet paper in the portable toilets. She was quickly tasked,
                            however, with coordinating boat trips for New Jersey-based family
                            members and survivors of the attack to go to Manhattan and see the site.
                            Every day between 10/6 and 12/2, she coordinated 200 family members and
                            50 volunteers to go across the river. After 12/2, trips continued
                            sporadically until 3/22/02. According to her, these trips provided
                            much-needed closure for many people because of an innate need to share
                            in the last place that a loved one had been. Kathryn gives a voice to
                            many different groups whose 9/11 stories are untold. For instance, she
                            tells the story of the Liberty State Park staff who pulled many
                            distraught New Yorkers from the river on the day of the attacks. These
                            people had jumped to escape the chaos near the towers during the attack,
                            and the Park staff stole boats from the marina to save them. Kathryn
                            also talks at length about the volunteer mental health counselors, whose
                            training could not have adequately prepared them to deal with the pain
                            of disaster recovery. According to her account, the counselors’ clinical
                            backgrounds made them desire more than anything to “fix” the pain that
                            the survivors and family members were feeling. However, because “you
                            can’t change the disaster,” they could only stand by and provide
                            companionship for those who were grieving. The stress of these moments
                            took its toll on her, as it did for everyone who was there. She says,
                            “Whoever I was when I went to Manhattan [for the first time after the
                            attacks] is not who I was when I came home.” That was particularly
                            difficult to cope with because many of her friends and family – who had
                            not been involved in the response to 9/11 – did not want to talk to her
                            about her experience at all. Despite this pain, she says she would do it
                            all again if she had to, without changing anything. For her, as for most
                            responders, there was an inexplicable drive to remain and help until
                            they were “done.” In her words, she “couldn’t not stay.” In times like
                            those, she found that everyone had to put their self-preservation
                            instinct aside, even if they couldn’t be rid of their feelings. She
                            recalls watching first responders digging through the pile until their
                            hands bled, crying all the while. Those people “knew it wouldn’t be
                            pretty afterward” for themselves, but they kept helping anyway. Kathryn
                            has since been diagnosed with PTSD, a diagnosis she shares with her
                            brother, a veteran of the Vietnam War. She has vivid memories of the
                            first time she stepped foot in Manhattan: the sight of emergency workers
                            lined up along the street crying, as well as the smell of melting
                            plastic, burning rubber, and death that surrounded her. Although the
                            experience lasted two minutes, she says it feels “like years” in her
                            mind, and to this day the smell of rain on hot cement takes her back to
                            that moment. Still, she chooses to take a positive outlook when
                            considering the impact and the lesson of her experience. She believes
                            that it demonstrates how precious life is and how beautiful humanity can
                            be when they come together to heal after a tragedy, and she wishes that
                            we as a society could focus on that bringing that beauty into the world
                            more often.

       On September 11, 2001, Rafael was living in Manhattan and working for
                            Verizon in Brooklyn. He was at the garage for a union/management meeting
                            when they were interrupted by a coworker telling them that the Towers
                            had been struck by a plane. They thought it was an accident, a Cessna or
                            small propeller plane. They could see the towers from the parking lot;
                            they saw the smoke and watched the second plane hit. At this point they
                            knew it was not an accident, not with a jet. He was convinced it was an
                            attack. The Verizon workers were told by the boss to just go to work,
                            since there was nothing that they could do. They went to their normal
                            coffee shop to get a cup and although they had never noticed it before,
                            the shop was run by people of Middle Eastern decent. While they spoke
                            English to the customers, the owners spoke their native language to each
                            other. It started to get ugly – the customers were saying, “Why are you
                            laughing, are you happy?” It was the stereotypical Middle East prejudice
                            – that these men must have known or been involved, and they left the
                            shop quickly. There was a lot of anger. Back at the garage, bosses were
                            asking who would be willing to volunteer if they were needed, and Rafael
                            agreed to go. The next day, those chosen to go were sent for safety
                            instruction and to be fitted for full face respirators. Verizon had
                            never trained for this type of response, and they had literally put this
                            together overnight. Danger or long term health issues didn’t play a part
                            in his decision to go, “if this was the only thing that I could do, then
                            I was going to do it.” Rafael would not have been able to sleep, would
                            have no peace if he didn’t help – it was the Christian thing to do, and
                            he would not be able to meet his Maker some day and say he hadn’t done
                            anything to help. They knew they would be doing restoration work but not
                            where or what hours. Although the group was made up of 100 different
                            Verizon workers, Rafael knew a lot of them from having worked in
                            different areas through the years. On the first bus ride in, the guys
                            were really ribbing each other, telling “Yo Momma” jokes, busting each
                            other’s chops, calling themselves “Brooklyn Bad Boys”. When the bus
                            exited the Manhattan side of the Battery Tunnel, every last one of them
                            was crying. It was horrific. The bus was quiet, filled with shock,
                            horror, anger, frustration. Then the feeling was – ok, now we know,
                            let’s do what we have to do. The initial shock made them realize how
                            vulnerable and ignorant of our own security we are. “It knocked us all
                            out; we didn’t feel so tough anymore”. Rafael was assigned to do
                            restoration at 140 West Street. An antenna from the building had pierced
                            through the cable vault and they had to verify what could be salvaged.
                            This building supplied communication to Wall Street, the Court systems,
                            and many businesses so it was a critical building to repair. The cables
                            were on multiple floors in the building, including the 8th floor. With
                            the power out there were many trips up and down the stairs with helmets,
                            Tyvek uniforms, respirators, steel toe boots, equipment – it all got
                            heavy; it was hot, tiring work. They would be interrupted every time a
                            siren went off – an eerie sound indicating they had to get out of the
                            building because it was unsafe. They were afraid, and some of the men
                            didn’t return to the site, saying they had families and were not willing
                            to die there. Rafael was scared, but kept coming back – he says, “Sirens
                            were always going off when I was on the 8th floor, why couldn’t they go
                            off when I was on the ground floor?” He was always running, panicked,
                            down eight flights of stairs to get out. Building Seven was called
                            “God’s House” because of the I-beams that remained standing like
                            crosses. Mass was held there every Sunday, and one Sunday Rafael
                            attended. There was an eerie quietness and his faith was shaken; he was
                            afraid to be there. The thought came to him – how could this happen, how
                            could so many people die? He felt an absence of God there. He stayed two
                            or three minutes and left quickly. He found a priest a few days later
                            and went to confession. The priest made him feel better but he still
                            never went back. He recently saw that same cross at the museum, and it
                            made him feel good to see it – it gave him a feeling of pride and
                            accomplishment, “I’m glad I was a part of this.” Rafael was working at
                            the site for 364 days, from 9/13/2001thru 9/12/2002 and watched the
                            transformation of the site. In July you could still smell the smoke and
                            ash down in the manholes and smelling it always brought back the first
                            day. They were splicing cables down the manhole in front of the
                            firehouse that had lost everyone, remembering their first day at the
                            site – “I can always bring back that smell”. Rafael feels that unless
                            you were there, you just can’t know. TV, stories, and novels – they
                            soften it all up, make you numb to it. “Seeing it face to face, this
                            wasn’t on the news, this is real – the magnitude, scale, smell, heat,
                            fire – days and weeks after, still fires – it can’t be put on video or
                            on paper”. It changed him as a person, giving him a drive that he didn’t
                            have before. He was comfortable previously, but this drive made him want
                            more for himself and his family. He bought a home in the suburbs, became
                            a manager, completed his MBA and got promoted. This path lead from dirty
                            jeans and a helmet to a collared shirt; union side to management side –
                            “Things can change just like that”, his expectations for himself
                            changed. “No matter how minimal your skill set or ability, every little
                            bit of effort counts; don’t let anyone minimize your part”.

       Paul was a NYPD patrol officer at the 104th Precinct in Queens. On
                            9-11-2001, he began his day routinely and reported to work as usual. He
                            and the other officers watched the footage on TV. The police radio was
                            blowing up calling for more units to help with traffic and evacuation.
                            His boss told them to suit up, and so he along with his Sergeant and
                            eight other officers were sent to the North Tower. Paul and the officers
                            loaded up in a van and headed to the WTC site. As they crossed over the
                            Brooklyn Bridge, they witnessed the explosion of the South Tower. He
                            knew then it was an act of terrorism. The mood was solemn, and they all
                            knew that it was no longer going to be routine. They arrived at their
                            muster point at the Pathmark food store. During roll call, he heard the
                            roaring thunder of the South Tower collapsing, along with people
                            screaming over the radios. The sky had turned black. It was then that he
                            knew the world had changed. Even today, thirteen years later, he can
                            still recall that thunderous sound vividly. There was no longer the need
                            for directing traffic or evacuating, so the Chief sent Paul and the crew
                            to secure the airshaft at the Holland Tunnel. While on the pier, he saw
                            the North Tower collapse and realized, that had he stayed at his
                            previous post, he would have died. Paul still thinks of this every day
                            of his life. Since the Holland Tunnel was secure, the officers would
                            rotate going to the site to see if there was anything else that they can
                            assist. There was a possible gas leak in a school across from the North
                            Tower. Paul helped escort the children quickly out and northward away
                            from the area. The children and teachers were very orderly, and free
                            from any hysteria. Paul’s most difficult recollections of 9/11 are that
                            of the sights and sounds of the jumpers. He would hear a distinct thud
                            and then remembers seeing body parts, mixed with grey mud. He knew that
                            if someone had opted to jump, being it that building had to be so much
                            worse. The piles of fire and dust where the buildings had once stood
                            made him sad and angry. He wanted revenge, because these innocent lives
                            were destroyed for no reason. Initially at The Pile, Fire Temper
                            Headquarters was chaotic, there was no cohesion and everyone was doing
                            what they felt was right. Paul had worked 24 hours straight, with no
                            food and very few breaks before his relief came. When he returned to the
                            precinct, his chief sent all of the officers to Cabrini Medical Center
                            to get checked out because he was covered with dust. He had his eyes
                            washed out and he was able to nap for a few hours. No one thought the
                            dust was toxic at that time and no one wore protective gear or masks, or
                            were encouraged to do so. He wasn’t able to return home because he had
                            to report back to work in 2 hours, which didn’t leave enough time to
                            drive home and back. Paul was able to contact his family via a CBS
                            satellite phone. He wasn’t able to reach his wife, but he was able to
                            speak to his mother to let him know that he was safe. It was three days
                            until he was able to return to home. He was lucky that he did not lose
                            anyone close to him. Since 1991, Paul has been the bugler for NYPD and
                            FDNY funerals and memorials. Throughout the years, he has played TAPS
                            countless times. Immediately after 9/11 he was playing it every day for
                            months. And now, due to the increase of deaths from diseases from 9/11,
                            he is in demand to play all over again. Despite all the horrific sights
                            and sounds that Paul experienced that day, he did not allow it to affect
                            him or his family in a negative way. He never discusses the events or
                            details with anyone or watches documentaries on 9/11. He keeps his
                            personal life separate from “the bad”. He appreciated the patriotism
                            that was displayed and the oneness that Americans had immediately
                            following 9/11. Everyone was nicer to each other and even the crime rate
                            and murders had declined. He found it heartwarming when people lined up
                            along the highway and clapped and cheered for the police and firemen as
                            they drove by. Paul is a prostate cancer survivor. He was diagnosed in
                            October 2013. He has known many people that have lost their lives due to
                            post 9/11 illnesses and cancer. He considers himself very fortunate that
                            he was spared, and is mindful that life is short. He is not as
                            optimistic as he used to be, and is scared for his family because the
                            world is getting worse, especially because his son is now a US Marine.
                            He is more protective of his family and admits to carrying his gun
                            everywhere. He knows that there are terrorist cells that are unknown to
                            us and it’s only a matter of time that it can happen again.

       On 9/11/2001, Steve was the Assistant Director of Emergency Services for
                            the Salvation Army. His office was located across the street from the
                            World Trade Center, but he was not there that day. Instead, he was en
                            route to a meeting at the NYC Fire Academy when he started picking up
                            ominous chatter on the FDNY two-way radio he had in his car. He says he
                            knew that something was wrong just from the tone of the firefighters’
                            voices, and began heading to the World Trade Center site before he even
                            knew what had happened. It was on the way to the World Trade Center that
                            he found out, from his wife on the phone, that a plane had hit the North
                            Tower. He also recalls seeing the destruction firsthand from the road,
                            as well as hearing firefighters calling for help over the radio. He was
                            on the road when the second plane hit, still en route to the disaster
                            site. By the time he arrived, the South Tower had already collapsed.
                            Upon arrival, Steve began helping to set up a staging area at the World
                            Financial Center while the North Tower was still standing. After this,
                            he began to walk toward the North Tower to assess the situation with his
                            colleague and close personal friend; before he got there, he decided to
                            turn back and get more batteries for his radio. At the exact moment he
                            opened his car door, the North Tower began to fall. He was pushed into
                            his car by a police officer and told to drive or die. His friend did not
                            survive the collapse. Steve describes the following hour as the worst
                            moments of his life. He describes the attack area – a two-block radius
                            covered by dust and bereft of radio communication or any contact with
                            the outside world – as an “island” where he was all alone. Only
                            adrenaline and his training kept him going through that time, during
                            which he didn’t know what was coming or if he would even make it out
                            alive. It was only after he was able to talk to his wife on the phone
                            that he felt some glimmer of hope, that things were at least OK in the
                            outside world. The first three days, which he spent at the site, were
                            “hell”: the air was dangerous and there was not enough equipment for all
                            of the volunteers and responders who needed it. Although Steve himself
                            did not get very sick from this, he knows many people who did. In his
                            time working for the Salvation Army, he had built up a network of
                            friends and acquaintances throughout the NYPD and FDNY hierarchies. He
                            says that, on that day, all of that camaraderie he had built came apart.
                            Above all, Steve hopes that all that loss and sacrifice will not be in
                            vain. He says that the tragedy has, overall, made him a gentler person,
                            but he still holds onto some anger toward the people who carried out the
                            attacks. He wishes that, throughout the world, people and governments
                            would stop using violence and start using words to express their
                            grievances and address their disagreements. On 9/11, and in its
                            aftermath, he saw that the world could come together in the wake of
                            disaster, bringing out the best of people at the worst of times. He
                            hopes that people can learn, from these events, to come together without
                            disaster, and be the best they can be at all times.

       Donald Anderson was a NYPD officer at the Manhattan Traffic Control
                            Building on W 30th Street and 7th Avenue. He had worked the previous
                            8-12 shift prior to 9/11, so that morning he was home, but his wife and
                            friends had left very early for NYC to see the Regis and Kelly Show. He
                            first learned of the attack on TV. When he saw the footage, he was
                            shocked, but didn’t think anything alarming until the second plane hit.
                            He wasn’t able to get in contact with his wife because all communication
                            was down. He made childcare arrangements and proceeded to his building.
                            His orders were to stay at their building and direct traffic, which was
                            mainly incoming. From his location he was not able to see the Towers,
                            but he was able to see and smell the smoke. The distinct smell of
                            burning flesh, to this day, he still has not forgotten. Donald’s wife
                            and friends made their way to his precinct, so unexpectedly he was able
                            to see his wife. At the same time, two businessmen entered the building
                            needing first aid; one man had a fractured leg. They were both dressed
                            in suits and totally covered with gray dust. Since Donald’s wife and her
                            friends were nurses, they were able to assist the businessmen
                            immediately. Donald worked 14 hr. shifts for a week, with no breaks, and
                            didn’t go home in between shifts. He slept wherever he could find a spot
                            because initially sleeping quarters hadn’t been set up. The officers
                            were assigned to groups of 8 with one Sergeant, and they remained with
                            the same group until the mandatory shifts were lifted. On the second
                            day, Donald and his group were sent down to a half block from Ground
                            Zero. He was assigned crowd control and secured the perimeter around the
                            site. When needed, he would escort any remains found up to the morgue.
                            Every time remains were found, no matter who it was, they were saluted
                            and draped with a US flag. Donald did suffer bilateral vision loss and
                            eye pain from all the debris he was exposed to. He also developed a
                            rash. He was sent home and received emergency treatment. Eventually his
                            sight was restored and his skin cleared. He did try to utilize a
                            respirator that he found in a box, but it proved to be useless when it
                            got clogged with dust. He said that the rubber on the respirator got
                            “burnt” from the debris, and it was impossible to communicate with it
                            on. Donald suffered one loss, his childhood friend, Lincoln Quappe, who
                            was “Rescue II” NYFD. He was grateful that he had a chance to see him
                            before he perished. Lincoln was the only funeral Donald attended. He
                            does not discuss the events with his family or coworkers, and never did.
                            He coped with 9/11 and its anniversaries by becoming withdrawn and
                            quiet. His family knows to give him his space and he retreats to that
                            place of isolation. Donald feels that he has become prejudice towards
                            Middle Eastern people because of 9/11. He is less prejudice today, but
                            still has no trust. He was disappointed with the city’s position to
                            rebuild on Ground Zero. He feels that it is sacred ground and the
                            Freedom Tower and Museum is just a way for people to make money. When
                            asked if he felt there was anything positive that came out of such a
                            horrific event, his reply was “no”. When asked if there was anything he
                            would want future generations to know, Donald said that there wasn’t,
                            but he had hoped it never happens again.

       “It all seemed so surreal…I will never forget the smell…the smell of
                            death.” Roberta lived and worked in Manhattan, five blocks from Ground
                            Zero. On the fateful morning of September 11, she was home. “I heard a
                            huge boom,” she recalled. “I thought it was a truck hitting a big
                            pothole.” She looked out off of her terrace and saw nothing; no truck,
                            no obvious cause of the boom. Her phone rang. It was her brother. “Turn
                            on the TV,” he instructed her. She followed his direction and then
                            turned and went back out to the terrace. The moment she stepped onto the
                            terrace, she witnessed the second plane impacting the second tower.
                            “Surreal”. Immediately, she thought “sabotage”. She knew it. Roberta
                            gathered her camera and tried to document what was occurring, but she
                            was unable to. Her knees “turned to water.” She was witnessing the
                            unimaginable. “The people, the people…look what’s happening…” she
                            exclaimed as she watched people jumping from the burning buildings.
                            “Surreal”. Roberta lost electricity in the apartment and at around 3:00
                            pm she decided that she could no longer stay in the apartment; her
                            “curiosity” had gotten the best of her. She grabbed her camera and
                            ventured outside. “It was a ghost town,” she remembers. As she wandered
                            the vacant streets, taking photos, she realized how bad the environment
                            was. Everywhere she looked was white. “The smell…the smell of death.”
                            “It all seemed like a dream…” She kept walking, curious about what had
                            occurred. “Does anybody need help? Anybody?” she asked. She realized how
                            bad the air was; it was thick. So, Roberta placed a bandana across her
                            nose and mouth, as a makeshift mask, in an effort to protect herself.
                            When she returned to her apartment, she was still without electricity,
                            and night had fallen. Having no electricity in the darkened city, she
                            stayed with her brother for a few days. She stayed with her brother in
                            Brooklyn, but still needed to go “home”. Roberta jokingly stated, “I
                            felt like Dorothy.” A few days after 9/11, Roberta went “home”. The day
                            after she returned to her apartment, she ventured down to the “site”.
                            Roberta was eager to help, but did not know how to go about it. As she
                            walked to the site, she came upon St. Seaman’s Church where she met a
                            local restaurant owner. As they discussed the dire conditions, he
                            invited her to accompany him to the local Pathmark to get food and bring
                            it to Ground Zero. “I was thrilled to be helping,” she recalls fondly.
                            In hindsight, Roberta believes that she was suffering a certain degree
                            of survivor’s guilt. As she helped, she recalls that she set up table
                            after table on Fulton Street where they handed out supplies: among other
                            things, socks, T-shirts, hammer, water and masks. “The supplies went so
                            fast,” she remembers. “They never seemed to have enough.” Roberta has a
                            vivid recollection that she and all of the volunteers had to wear masks
                            while manning the supply tables. She was hurt that the supplies ran out
                            so quickly, especially the masks. Feeling so badly that there were no
                            masks left for these men working on the pile, she gave hers away to
                            them. She would give away her “skimpy mask” to someone who needed it
                            more than me.” Her recollection of the workers who took supplies:
                            “humble and grateful.” When we ran out of supplies there were constant
                            reassurances from them of “don’t worry, it’s ok,” and they would
                            continue on their way to work on the pile. Roberta spent three months on
                            Fulton Street handing out supplies to the workers. During this time, she
                            was able to recruit many others who were more than willing to lend a
                            hand. She also went into the church at St. Seaman’s to chat with the men
                            who came in for a moment of peace. “I listened, “she said. “I gave them
                            a chance to be heard and take their mind off of it; if for only a
                            minute.” But, around Thanksgiving, she didn’t feel needed there anymore,
                            and ultimately, stopped going. When questioned as to who she looked to
                            for support during this time, Roberta naturally cited family and
                            friends, but also mentioned the guilt she felt as a survivor and that
                            the only thing that could alleviate this feeling, was contributing and
                            helping to the recovery process of others. Finally Roberta thoughtfully
                            offers this: “Whatever happens in life is your choice. Never put blame,
                            everyone is the same…always live and love.” Roberta is still helping in
                            other ways; she is currently a “Life Coach”.

       Fay is the mother of six children, and has several grandchildren and
                            great grandchildren, and the wife of an Orthodox Rabi. She is a retired
                            Early Childhood Intervention teacher. She has spent her life
                            volunteering for various causes and being active with her congregation.
                            On the morning of 9/11, she had just retired and heard about the first
                            plane crash from her friend who was in EMS. She turned on her TV, and
                            then she learned of the second plane crash, and then she knew it was no
                            accident. Fay was living in Forest Hills, Queens. The first thing she
                            did was contact all of her children who worked in NYC to make sure they
                            were all safe. Her one daughter was 9 months pregnant and been on her
                            way to the OB/GYN in Manhattan. Her daughter was one of the last people
                            to cross the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, and even saw the smoke from the
                            building collapse in her rearview mirror as she drove north on the FDR
                            Drive. Thankfully, all Fay’s loved ones were fine. Fay felt the very
                            least she could do to help would be to donate blood, which is something
                            that she did routinely throughout her life. She immediately went up to
                            Booth Memorial Hospital in Flushing, Queens to donate. By the next
                            morning, she knew that blood was no longer needed but still wanted to do
                            something to help. She decided to contact the Salvation Army and Red
                            Cross. Within a few weeks the Salvation Army called her back and asked
                            to help serve hot meals to the First Responders. She would work full
                            days twice a week for almost a year, until the tent was finally stopped
                            serving meals and was closed. Fay traveled the subway to Manhattan to
                            serve food at the tent dubbed the “Taj Majal”. The first time she came
                            out of the subway, her first vision was the nightmarish sight of
                            everything destroyed. She said it look like a scene in a bad movie. Fire
                            trucks and ambulances were crushed by fallen debris. She can still
                            remember all of the Missing Person signs and the many memorials that
                            were posted throughout the city. Fay commended the Salvation Army’s
                            efforts in organizing and providing food and a break room for the First
                            Responders. She said they did an amazing job. The food came in from
                            various restaurants and they even had a chef. People from all over the
                            world and of all ages would come to volunteer and serve in any way
                            possible. The air in the tent was filtered, so she never had any
                            breathing issues or was exposed to the toxic dust from Ground Zero. One
                            of Fay’s most painful memories was all of the FDNY, dressed in their
                            brown coveralls, who would finally sit down to get a bite to eat, and
                            when they would hear crackling noises over the radio, all of them would
                            stand up and leave their meals; for they knew that they had found
                            another FDNY’s body. Fay recalled the thousands of letters and artwork
                            that came from children from all over the country to express their
                            thanks for the bravery of the First Responders. The cards and pictures
                            were displayed on the tables for everyone to look over while they were
                            eating and taking a break. Some of the sentiments would make you cry and
                            others would make you laugh or smile. She felt it was a good way for the
                            children to express themselves, because even young children knew
                            something terrible was going on. All of the events of 9/11 have been
                            permanently engraved in Fay’s heart. She feels that just like the
                            Holocaust, we have to remind the new generations of the horrors of this
                            history to keep the memory alive and hopefully prevent it from happening
                            again. She believes we must preserve what our Founding Fathers did and
                            make them proud. She wants the US to remain a “beacon of freedom” and a
                            “light to the world”.

       Jesse was born in Brooklyn and attended Syracuse University and then
                            Columbia Law School. He met and his wife Elaine and in his senior year
                            of law school they married. He practiced law privately from 1962 to
                            1965, and then went to work for the City of New York in the Law
                            Department. He liked working in the city law department, but felt he
                            couldn’t raise a family on that salary and so went back into private
                            practice until 1994. At this point his children were grown, and he went
                            back to the law department, relocating to Manhattan. On September 11th,
                            he was the Assistant Commissioner for Real Estate Services in the city’s
                            Department of Citywide Administrative Services. When the first plane
                            hit, Jesse was working in the Municipal Building on 23rd Street, which
                            is about a thousand yards from the World Trade Center. Senior staff
                            decided to evacuate the building, and gathered what meagre medical
                            supplies they had and headed to the east side of City Hall Park where
                            the ambulances were stationed. With a hand truck, they brought all the
                            water cooler jugs they could to the corner of Chambers and Centre
                            Street. At this time, this area was the mustering point for the NYPD and
                            FDNY so they gave out water to the soot covered responders. The next
                            day, he was told to report to the Police Academy on 21st Street to get
                            credentials and began working 19 hour shifts providing logistical
                            support. Jesse recalls with great detail the complications of
                            orchestrating such an immense project – from where to locate the
                            mountains of donations, the removal of tons of debris, to the delivery
                            and maintenance of portable toilets. He states they were coordinating
                            approximately a fifth of the 250,000 person city work force. He worked
                            directly at the site in this capacity until November. In the summer of
                            2002, the Law Department formed a World Trade Center Unit in the torts
                            division of the Law Department. Jesse applied for and became the
                            Assistant Chief of the WTC Unit. His main responsibility was defense of
                            property damage litigation. He goes on to describe the work this
                            involved, including preparing witnesses for the 9-11 Commission. Being
                            responsible for screening all the audio tapes of the events of the day
                            was horrible; he had to listen to each recording of the people who had
                            been trapped in the buildings and decide what needed to be redacted
                            prior to publication. Jesse states this was the worst thing he had to
                            do, even though it was two years later. Jesse says the ability to be
                            involved constructively helped him to deal with the situation as a
                            whole. When asked what future generations should learn from this
                            experience or take away from his interview, Jesse states that the world
                            is so interconnected and nobody is safe, nobody is separate. There are
                            limits to political and military power. “Exercise of political and
                            military power invariably results in a counter-response. And innocent
                            people get killed.”

       Stephen has been a police officer for twenty-nine years, and has
                            experienced a lot of things, but nothing could have prepared him for the
                            events of September 11th. It was the early morning on September 11th ,
                            and Stephen was spending time with a friend. He was lying in bed when
                            his friend called to him “come and watch this on TV”. The first plane
                            had just hit the North Tower. “How could this be?” he thought. “I had
                            the look of a deer in the headlights.” He immediately got dressed and
                            into his car, and drove straight into Manhattan. As he drove along the
                            West Side Highway, he recalls seeing people with signs saying “please
                            help.” “This was all so surreal”. As he got closer to the Towers, he
                            could see people running; running everywhere. “What was going on?” he
                            wondered. He then saw some of his colleagues, and together, they jumped
                            into a van and drove closer toward the Towers. Once he arrived at the
                            site, he just thought, “Where do I being, where do I start?” He
                            remembers looking down and seeing a lone shoe amongst all of the debris.
                            Reality was setting in. He didn’t realize it then, but that shoe would
                            be something that would haunt and follow him forever. Stephen had been
                            an electrician before joining the Police Department, and as such, his
                            expertise was welcomed. He was assigned to man the generators, making
                            sure that they were running, especially at dark so that the rescue
                            efforts could continue through the night. The conditions were dangerous
                            everywhere. The first few nights that he was there, he would sleep
                            against a wall in the vestibule of a building that was blown up. He
                            finally felt some comfort when the ship “Spirit of New York” arrived. It
                            allowed the rescuers to come aboard to shower, get a bite to eat, and
                            rest. “How happy they were for this”. Through it all, Stephen remembers
                            how people just “came together”. Everyone wanted to help; everyone
                            wanted to donate. He will never forget the bag lunches that were sent
                            from school children in the Midwest with notes of thanks to the
                            volunteers, and seeing police cars from every state of the nation, there
                            just to lend a helping hand. He cannot forget the charity of the manager
                            of Home Depot telling him to take “whatever it is you need,” or the
                            woman in the airport who “hugged him so tight” when she saw his NYPD
                            T-shirt. Among all the horror that he witnessed, these were the images
                            that kept him going: from seeing such hatred, to seeing such good in
                            people. Stephen would like people to always remember that day. That day,
                            when so many innocent people died, and how that changed this country
                            forever. The difficult sites and the horrible smells that he witnessed,
                            and that “lone shoe,” that single shoe that belonged to someone he will
                            never know. These things will forever remain etched in his mind, but so
                            too, will the way that this nation pulled together. “All for one,”
                            Stephen says, “we became family”.

       On the morning of September 11th, Vincent Gonzalez was at work at his job
                            in security for the government. He was on the corner of Dwayne and
                            Broadway when he and a fellow co-worker heard the sound of a roaring
                            engine. They looked up; it was the first plane hitting the North Tower.
                            “What is going on”? “This feels like I’m in a movie, “he recalls
                            thinking. They began walking toward the Tower. People were running in
                            every direction. As he got closer, the building collapsed. He remembers
                            just surveying the situation and feeling so “helpless”. “It looked like
                            a war zone”. He walked back to his building on Broadway and just
                            listened to the radio reports, as did so many that morning. Vincente was
                            assigned to work security at a make shift morgue on the West Side
                            Highway. He recalls how many people would come looking for loved ones.
                            He will never forget their desperate faces and how difficult it was to
                            turn them away. Vincente would work at this morgue for six months, but
                            for as hard as this was for him to witness, he knew this was where he
                            had to be. He will always remember how the people of New York rallied
                            together in a common cause. There were always so many signs thanking
                            him, and his fellow responders, every day. The support was overwhelming.
                            Vincente will always remember when President George Bush visited Ground
                            Zero. “This really helped the morale of so many,” said Vincente.
                            Vincente found that taking small trips out of the city, from time to
                            time, would help him in his healing process. He needed to “leave it
                            behind” and be with his family, who means the world to him. Like so many
                            others who helped so selflessly, Vincente, would like all future
                            generations to remember, “Freedom is not free; always support your armed
                            forces. Live your life; you never know what tomorrow brings.

       Anthony grew up in Elmont, NY, by the Belmont Racetrack and started
                            working in the printing business since this is what his father did for a
                            living. Shortly after taking the sanitation exam, in 1984, he was called
                            to work for the Department of Sanitation of New York (DSNY). On the
                            morning of 9/11, when his local garage in Inwood, Manhattan (215th
                            Street) realized what was going on, they were ordered back and were sent
                            home shortly thereafter. At this time, Anthony was living in New Jersey
                            and was going to be taking the George Washington Bridge home. Just as he
                            came up to the bridge, they closed it. As he was hopefully waiting for
                            the bridge to reopen, four strangers came up to his car asking for rides
                            back to the Jersey side of the bridge. Anthony was originally worried to
                            let them in due to the circumstances of the day, but ended up allowing
                            them in. Shortly after the bridge reopened and the car packed with 5
                            adults made its way to the New Jersey side of the Hudson River. This is
                            when Anthony felt safe again. He looks back and he’s very glad that he
                            ended up doing this. These people just wanted to get back to their
                            homes, their families, where they would feel safe and comfortable.
                            Anthony was a volunteer firefighter in New Jersey and kept thinking
                            about what the FDNY firefighters were going through. He went to his
                            firehouse on 9/11/2001 and the next day. He Looking back, he was very
                            happy with his decision and retired in 2007

       Barbara was born in Switzerland and moved to New York as a young child.
                            She moved often, from Manhattan to upstate New York, and settled on the
                            North Shore of Long Island when she was in 6th grade. She began her
                            career in Social Work after finding her work in fashion and art to be
                            ridiculous and vapid. She graduated from Columbia in 1994. During the
                            9/11 timeframe, she was working with a Mobile Crisis Team who received
                            referrals from the New York City Mental Health Hotline. She was living
                            on Reid Street in lower Manhattan with a daughter in High School and a
                            son in second grade. On the morning of 9/11, Barbara dropped her son
                            Jack off at school and heard the first plane fly overhead – it was a
                            huge noise, the largest noise she had ever heard. She saw the tail of
                            the plane protruding from the side of the building but didn’t think of
                            terrorism; she was reminded of the small propeller plane that had struck
                            the buildings in the 1940’s or 1950’s. She didn’t know what to do – so
                            she proceeded to run errands, buying cat food and toilet paper. Upon
                            reflection, she believes she must have been in shock because her actions
                            seem odd to her. She questions why her first thoughts were not to get
                            her kids to safety, why her ‘motherly instincts’ did not kick in. The
                            second plane hit while she was on her way home and at this point she
                            realized that she would not be going to work. She went onto the roof of
                            her building with other tenants she was friends with. They had a
                            straight view to the burning towers, being only six blocks away. She saw
                            people jumping, and thought it was debris. She felt like she was on
                            auto-pilot, the events were too shocking and she couldn’t absorb the
                            horror. One image in particular she feels she has PTSD about: a small
                            man falling with his necktie fluttering in the wind. A friend on the
                            roof said the towers was falling; it seemed in slow motion, the breaking
                            glass looked like crystal moving towards you in huge clouds of smoke.
                            When she went to get her son Jack, all the children were in the basement
                            of the school. The two of them went to find her daughter, moving aside
                            police barriers to get through – they were running by the time the
                            second tower collapsed. They watched it fall, but kept running. By the
                            time they arrived at the High School, it had already been evacuated.
                            Because she was walking with a child, other parents stopped her and
                            asked where the students had been brought, but she didn’t know; there
                            are many schools in the area. They stopped on 22nd Street to eat Jack’s
                            box lunch, and people were taking turns using the bar’s land line. She
                            remembers there being a lot of bees, which she is allergic to, and
                            thought, “Oh please don’t let me get stung on top of everything else!”
                            It was surreal. She dropped Jack off at a friend’s and proceeded to
                            register with the Red Cross. She signed up for a shift the next day and
                            passed a sleepless night at home. She was at Shea Stadium where rescue
                            vehicles were being stocked. It was teeming with Red Cross volunteers,
                            donations, food, and blankets. The social workers were conducting small
                            interventions with police and soldiers who came in. After a day’s work
                            organizing and dispersing supplies, a Red Cross truck drove her home
                            where she saw lines of idling trucks that were being used as morgues.
                            The next day, her second assignment was at FIT (Fashion Institute of
                            Technology) where facilities were set up for people that were stranded
                            in the city. There was a group of fanatic Michael Jackson fans from
                            Germany who had come for a concert – it was surreal. She spent the night
                            here helping in any way she could. The next day, she was turned away as
                            a volunteer because there was such an influx of willing helpers; it was
                            chaos. She felt this was her darkest hour - she realized she only felt
                            in control because she was staying busy and helping. She spoke to a
                            wonderful older female therapist to debrief, and the therapist helped
                            her see that she was both a victim and a helper. She went home and got
                            cleaned up. She came up with a plan to be able to help – she opened up
                            her home to rescue workers who might need rest or a shower. She left her
                            house key on a board with the Salvation Army truck on her corner, but no
                            one came. She began helping the volunteers at this truck, providing
                            food, painkillers, Visine, mouthwash and clothing. She became close with
                            these people, and is still in contact with some of them. She gave an ice
                            pack from her house to a firefighter with a burnt face – this was as
                            close as she got to anyone with a real injury. She wanted her kids to
                            come home but she realized it was a bad idea, so they stayed with their
                            father. It was like living in a war zone; you always had to have photo
                            ID on you and find alternative travel routes. Schools were not up and
                            running for months, and the children were transferred to other schools.
                            “Life was strange for months.” Many years later, her son Jack admitted
                            to being terrified for years after the attack. “It impacted us all
                            forever.” She has “very specific PTSD”: images can make her cry in an
                            instant, she would never be able to visit the museum. She remembers
                            vividly what she was wearing, the grapefruit scented candle that was
                            burning the night she was all alone in her dark building, being so
                            grateful for having running water. She states she is a single mom – she
                            can’t fall apart. Just move forward and do what you need to do. The war
                            has become mundane, almost narcissistic – “…it sounds horrible, but
                            let’s get over it and move on. It’s horrible every day, everywhere.
                            Things just don’t have that much meaning.” Her personal philosophy is
                            that good things and bad things happen; you never know what’s going to
                            happen. If the subject of 9/11 comes up, she feels fragile, but people
                            have always lived through horrible things. “Shocking, sad…but in terms
                            of the specifics of my life it has done no harm except emotionally.”

       Carmen was born in Eastern Cuba. She is a part of an old traditional
                            family that lived in the countryside with chickens and horses; at 5:00pm
                            all work would stop, and everyone would shower and dress formally for
                            dinner. Carmen is what she called a “Peter Pan Child” – during the Cuban
                            revolution she was sent out of the country without her parents. She was
                            sent to Miami, Florida to live with a great aunt. She remembers vividly,
                            on July 15, 1961 her father gave her a paper bag with holes in it. It
                            contained a zun-zun (a miniature hummingbird). Her father told her she
                            had to let it go – “Some birds cannot live in a cage.” This was her
                            father’s way of teaching her the hard choices of letting go; she was her
                            parent’s zun-zun. She waited five years for the return of her parents,
                            and when her father died early at 55 years of age they moved to New
                            York. Carmen’s background is in international broadcasting, and she
                            works for the United Nations reporting on international politics. On
                            September 11th, Carmen was scheduled for a vacation day but went into
                            work anyway. She would normally take the 8:00am ferry, but today she
                            took the 8:30am saying, “I am always rushing, why do I always rush?” She
                            remembers vividly her black skirt, auburn top, silk jacket with a beige
                            and red rose, and her morning coffee in one hand, newspaper in the
                            other. She was enjoying the beautiful clear blue skies when she heard a
                            man scream, “Oh my God!” She looked up, and flames were coming out of
                            the World Trade building. She called a friend on her cell phone and told
                            him “an idiot just flew into the World Trade Center”. Walking down the
                            ferry ramp, the second plane hit. She had seen the plane go by overhead,
                            and saw the American Flag – she thought they were safe because of the
                            flag, which had always represented safety to her. She saw silhouettes
                            pressed against the windows of the plane, and saw that the plane was
                            flying over the ferry terminal sideways “to maximize impact: they would
                            kill more people this way, more floors of the building would be covered
                            in the carnage.” She didn’t see it hit because other buildings in the
                            area blocking her view, but she heard the impact. People on the ferry
                            ramp literally froze. Carmen screamed, “You have just witnessed a
                            terrorist attack! Get back on the boat!” This snapped people out of
                            their stupor. The ferry captain brought the boat back, and told people
                            to put on life jackets in case a third plane attacked. She had to decide
                            to get on the ferry or to stay – but she had once had to leave paradise
                            [Cuba] and she decided she was not leaving Manhattan. Cell phones ceased
                            to work. Walking up Broadway, she heard the collapse. It was time to
                            “run to the water” [save herself]; people were becoming “vertical
                            ovens”. The whole of southern Manhattan had tremors. She could feel the
                            first collapse and was engulfed in the cloud. “Fast planes were flying
                            on top of us” which she later learned were Air Force Fighter jets sent
                            to shoot down any additional incoming planes. At the time she just
                            thought “we are going to get hit again”. The second collapse was worse,
                            adding more debris and dust to the air. She couldn’t breathe; wet paper
                            towels over her mouth didn’t help as they would almost instantly dry.
                            People were running for their lives over the Brooklyn Bridge; no movie
                            by Spielberg could have captured what she saw – it was like she was at a
                            Concentration Camp. She saw a man in Jewish garb, and screamed at him,
                            “You have to pray!” which he immediately did….she saw this man four
                            years later on the Staten Island Ferry, and said to him, “I don’t
                            normally speak to men I don’t know but I once screamed at you – “ and he
                            turned to her and said, “ OH! That was you?!” They have been friends
                            ever since. She witnessed a mother holding her small child up over her
                            head, saying – look at this, never forget this. She started transmitting
                            on a military phone; she found a Mexican man and told him to start
                            speaking into the phone, she brought people into her “Coast Guard
                            broadcasting booth” to interview. She did this until 5:00, when she went
                            home. She went back to work the next day. The first Red Cross organizer
                            was a fellow Peter Pan Child, and she had to find him, needed to hear
                            his story. “A kid who came alone [to this country], without parents, was
                            the first to arrive to help.” Walking through the streets, the debris
                            was up to the middle of her leg. She was looking for him to make sure
                            the listeners knew that in all this horror there were people sharing
                            their love and concern – she wanted to “balance the story”. Doing the
                            interview with this man gave her strength, “we will not allow them to
                            win”; it was a sense of empowerment. September 11th was a defining
                            moment in journalism. For the first time it was acceptable to cry on the
                            air. She states that the journalist should try to give the information
                            free of their personal feeling – but this severity could not be
                            downplayed. Carmen worries about her health. A good friend is going into
                            surgery the day after this taping; another who was with her on 9/11 died
                            11 months ago. She states she didn’t choose it; she chose to stay, but
                            there is a lesson to be learned. “We all come to give back and not just
                            to take – a community of people [survivors and volunteers] who witnessed
                            horror”. “I am glad my parents weren’t alive to see 9/11. God was
                            merciful to take them. To future generations, I would say: Do unto
                            others as you would have others do unto you. Remember that.”

       Cecilia grew up in Huntington and Buffalo New York. She attended college
                            in Portland Oregon, and returned to New York to go to film school. She
                            is a television Production Manager. Like a lot of people, on 9/12/2001
                            Celia reported to the Jacob Javits Center to volunteer. After spending
                            several hours on line, they took her name and number. She felt this was
                            futile, and knew they would never call her back. Cecilia got a contact
                            name and number for the Red Cross, and went there to volunteer. She
                            reported to Saint Johns respite center, but there was not much happening
                            there. She walked around the center and found the logistics station – it
                            was swamped, so she jumped behind the table to help give out boots,
                            shampoo, etc. She did this two days per week, from about 4:00 pm to
                            midnight until around Thanksgiving when the respite center was shut
                            down. She felt good about volunteering; it was upsetting to be there but
                            she felt she was contributing and making a difference. Volunteers were
                            supposed to only stay for three weeks, but she managed to get an ‘open
                            ended’ pass, which entitled her to continue working. She stayed in
                            logistics where she was needed most. In the beginning, everyone who came
                            in was either FDNY or NYPD doing recovery – they always needed new boots
                            because they would get burned. The responders would talk to the people
                            behind the tables; it seemed to Cecilia that the social workers who were
                            available were not as ‘visible’ as those behind the table with the
                            boots. The responders told them stories of friends who had died; she
                            felt it was important to listen to their stories; she felt one step
                            removed because she had not lost anyone. Cecilia’s friends were not
                            interested in hearing her stories, they were not empathetic. She stopped
                            talking to her ‘civilian friends’ and relied on other volunteers. She
                            didn’t even really speak to her mom about it, although she had lived
                            through the Blitz in London. She has friends on the west coast who were
                            impressed that she was volunteering and wanted to hear about it, but her
                            New York friends did not. She became friendly with a NYPD officer who
                            worked at the precinct across the street from the logistics center, and
                            one day he drove them around in an SUV. They were just a couple of
                            blocks away from the site, a place that was never covered on the news,
                            and the destruction opened her eyes. One night they jumped the fence and
                            went right into the pit – it was amazing to see how deep it was. She
                            asked, “What is that yellow smoke?” and the answer was, “Oh, poison and
                            shit.” It was enormous. That December, she went to Los Angeles to
                            celebrate Christmas, and once she was there she realized she had a
                            constant cough. After leaving the city, she had time to process and
                            think things through; it was like living in a war zone. “It seems
                            incredible that people can create such destruction [and] devastation.
                            And that people can come together and cope, and help.”

       Joseph grew up in foster care in the town of Holbrook, New York. He moved
                            to the Bronx at 11 years of age after his parents fought to get custody
                            of him. It was a tough transition to go from Holbrook to the Projects,
                            and he missed his foster parents terribly. He loves his parents for
                            fighting for him but it was tough. Joe married in 1995 and moved back to
                            Holbrook – he states it was great to get back there. He served in the
                            NYPD for 20 years and retired in 2006. Currently he is an armed guard
                            for a jewelry company in Manhattan, supplying jewelry to photo shoots
                            and movies. On September 11th, Joe was assigned to the 106 squad in
                            Queens as a detective. He was home with his wife when a neighbor told
                            them the towers were hit. He turned on the TV and knew it was a
                            terrorist attack. He waited for the phone to ring and call him into
                            work. They watched the towers fall, and he told his wife, “Do you know
                            how many cops and firemen were in that building?!” Then the phone rang
                            and he was called in. His squad was cleared to go to Ground Zero after
                            three days. The first day they were on the bucket brigade – just in
                            jeans, t-shirts and jackets, he and his partner Brian were supposed to
                            work only a twelve hour shift but they were there for at least 20. They
                            lost track of where their supervisor and other cops from the precinct
                            were. Going in this first time was terrifying, but he knew it was going
                            to be okay because he was with the police department. The devastation
                            was horrible – when they got to the ledge of the pit, there was a priest
                            blessing each and every person going down into it. This made him realize
                            how dangerous it was; there was debris still falling, “Tons and tons of
                            debris, tons of cops, just everyone – PD, FD, union workers” filling
                            buckets with debris using their bare hands, passing the buckets down the
                            line to be emptied. “It was bad; I knew the country was in trouble.”
                            After working like this for three days, they were distributed paper face
                            masks. Once Joe was assigned to fresh kills, he was given a Tyvek suit
                            and a good mask to sift through debris. They raked through the debris,
                            finding elevator cables that seemed to go on for miles, lots of metal:
                            they were looking for the black box flight recorder. They would see
                            computer towers and think they found it, but as far as Joe knows they
                            were never recovered. It was horrible at the morgue. “I’ve seen dead
                            bodies, dead babies in the street. These bodies looked like dirty grey
                            carpets. They were trying to get DNA and here I am in my Tyvek suit…”
                            Whenever a firefighter body was brought in, they would all line up
                            outside and the ambulance would drive slowly by while they saluted. One
                            time, the back of the ambulance opened, and the bag was so flat – it was
                            just a glove with a hand in it. This made him think of how bad it truly
                            was, “Everyone was just smithereens.” Joe remembers everything at Ground
                            Zero being pulverized – no desks, chairs, but there were tons of metal
                            flush handles from the urinals. Shoes were everywhere. At Fresh Kills
                            Landfill on Staten Island, they would sift through the debris on the
                            conveyor belts, and they thought they saw a police shield. They stopped
                            the belt, and looked through the huge pile until they found it. Joe
                            remembers it was Moira Smith’s shield. But, “you’d never know there were
                            human remains. Fresh Kills should be a holy spot; there are just too
                            many remains there still.” The first few days at the land fill, the Red
                            Cross was in small tents on dirt; the ground would bubble underneath
                            your feet. To enter the tents, you would first take off your boots and
                            Tyvek suits; the boots would be cleaned while you ate. The Red Cross
                            volunteers would always be smiling, and it amazed Joe that these people
                            would leave their homes and come to this “pile of debris and death” to
                            help. It is a great memory. He remembers them handing out boots, jeans,
                            Home Depot work gloves - whole blocks of skids filled with water, a 40
                            foot trailer that was actually a McDonald’s restaurant handing out fresh
                            hot burgers and fries; he reflects now that it probably wasn’t a good
                            idea to be preparing food, having food exposed to the bad air. Years
                            later, he thinks, “Maybe that food was contaminated, people walking
                            around [at the landfill, in the pit] with Outback Steak cheeseburgers,
                            exposed to that air.” Joe acknowledges his longtime partner, Brian Mann
                            – the best partner, would do anything for you. “When I was tired and
                            cold, he said Joe go sit down; great, great man. I trust him with my
                            life – I am married to my wife, but I am ‘married’ to Brian too. So
                            happy he was there with me.” This was his ‘biggest experience’ as a
                            police officer – down in “this huge hole, beams over our heads, but I’m
                            a cop, I’m here to help”. He states he had a job to do, and it was an
                            honor to be there.

       On 9/11/2001, Robert was a NYPD patrol officer in the Emergency Services
                            Unit, one of two sector trucks, named “Boy 9”. He began his career in
                            1984, went to the emergency unit in 1988, and retired in 2004. He was
                            living in Deer Park, Long Island with his wife and two children at the
                            time of the attacks. On that morning, Robert was with his partner in the
                            garage at the 113th Precinct in Queens, when they first heard that a
                            “plane” hit the tower, but they thought it was a small plane. Then over
                            the radio, they called for all city wide units to respond. They drove
                            via the Belt Pkwy and the tunnel to lower Manhattan. The radio became
                            increasing busier and louder and learned it was a bigger plane, so he
                            got himself mentally prepared for a bigger disaster. When he came out of
                            the tunnel, the 2nd plane hit and his truck was being pelted with body
                            parts and all kinds of debris. It was total chaos but he stayed in his
                            truck and made his way it to the pier, because that’s what he did for
                            the first WTC bombing in 1993. Robert suited up with rescue equipment
                            and headed on foot towards the towers. It was raining paper and the
                            buildings were on fire. When the first tower came down, he started to
                            run down West St. He swallowed so much gray dust, it chunked up in his
                            throat and he couldn’t breathe. He was put in an ambulance. He turned
                            out to be fine, so he went back. Then the second tower fell, and he
                            blacked out. When he woke up he was put in an ambulance and was brought
                            to St Luke’s hospital. Again, he turned out to be fine, so he left and
                            returned to the scene again. When he did, the windows from Building 7
                            were popping out, so he knew that building was about to come down too,
                            and had everyone get out and run. Robert wasn’t able to contact his
                            family until that evening because the cell phones and communication was
                            down. His unit’s mobilization point was at the Stuyvesant High School.
                            He was able to use a landline phone to call home to let everyone know he
                            was fine. It turned out that his family already knew because they had
                            already seen the news footage of him being put on an ambulance. Robert
                            sought no other medical attention and didn’t return home until 4 am. He
                            tried to get a few hours of sleep then returned. He worked 20 hr. days
                            during the first week. During that week, it was very difficult to find a
                            bathroom, food or any area to rest. When the Salvation Army and Red
                            Cross were able to set up their tents, things got a lot better. They
                            provided them with food, water, socks, and anything else they needed. He
                            met many good people from all over the world. He was nicely surprised
                            that they got help so quickly from Miami Dade, the Gun Runners from
                            LAPD, and the FBI. Robert’s most vivid memories were how his boots
                            melted from being on the pile in the Bucket Brigade from the smoldering
                            steel beams. He remembers the first body he found was FDNY. When he had
                            found a young woman’s torso, he couldn’t sleep for weeks. Robert
                            continued to work at Ground Zero until June 2002, when the last pieces
                            were brought to the museum. He felt guilty going home because he knew
                            that his fallen comrades would have never gone home. Robert’s life has
                            been greatly affected by PTSD. He doesn’t have any closure and feels
                            that he will never have that because “it wasn’t meant to be”. He doesn’t
                            talk to his family about the events. It took him until June 2002 before
                            he was able to cry because he had been so numb. He describes the pain
                            from PTSD being worse than the surgery he had on his arm. Robert does
                            not feel like a hero. He feels that he ran away from the falling
                            buildings while others ran inside. He was trained for disasters and he
                            does what he has to do. He has bagged over 2000 bodies in his career,
                            and would respond again if he had to.

       Reverend Parish grew up in Knoxville, TN. He was interested in the
                            Ministry while in High School but at the time was a Baptist, and decided
                            that was not the way to go. He loved science and earned a PhD from
                            Harvard Medical School. He discovered the current treatment for
                            Parkinson Disease; “I didn’t get the patent (smiling) so there’s no
                            money, but I helped hundreds of thousands of people.” He also attended
                            Harvard Business School, where he met his wife. He has a love of
                            creativity, and received a Creativity Award while at Harvard for the
                            writing the parody “Cheap Gas”, which is still in production today. In
                            1972 his life changed dramatically when his father died tragically in a
                            house fire. His mother was pulled out of the fire, but weather dead or
                            alive he didn’t know. He arrived at the hospital to find her sitting up
                            and smiling; a pastor came and prayed with them and he felt a tremendous
                            spiritual energy – “like lightening had struck” and his life was changed
                            forever. Reverend Parish then went on a journey to figure out what had
                            happened and to figure out what to do. He became involved with pastoral
                            care at the church next door to where he worked. He loved ‘active
                            listening’ and eventually went to Union Seminary to become an Episcopal
                            Priest. Reverend Parish then went on a journey to figure out what had

                            Priest. During his first shift at a hospital caring for terminal
                            patients, he had five deaths in one night – a real “trial by fire”. He
                            seemed to “always have the tough stuff” during his ministry, and having
                            been a research scientist was always surrounded by intellectuals,
                            researchers, doctors, etc. - he needed to find a place to become a “real
                            Priest”. He became involved with a homeless program at Saint
                            Bartholomew’s church. The church had the” most beautiful entryway in the
                            city with heavenly mosaic tiles on the ceiling” and this space was
                            filled with cots every night to become a homeless shelter. On September
                            11th, Reverend Parish was driving to his job as a Federal Chaplain in
                            Elizabeth New Jersey when he heard the first plane had struck, and then
                            watched the second plane approaching. He saw thousands and thousands of
                            people walking. He his wife home, and received an email from his Bishop
                            to volunteer as a chaplain in a hospital. He went to Bellevue at 5:30pm
                            but they didn’t need any help. He began to think, where would the
                            injured be taken? He walked to Trauma One at St. Vincent’s and the
                            police let him through the barriers because of his priest garb. He
                            couldn’t find the Chaplain’s office – every flat surface was covered
                            with sheets to be ready for the expected injured, but no one came in. He
                            didn’t really grasp it yet – it was all or none; either you got out and
                            were fine or you died. He found the Chaplain and was given a list of the
                            “most traumatized people” to help – which in turn traumatized him:
                            people burned head to toe; an elevator repair man who had free-fallen 12
                            stories when the cable snapped and survived; a fireman who was the only
                            survivor in his company. He worked one day on, one day off in order to
                            have time to decompress and heal. He stayed at St. Vincent’s for about
                            three weeks until all his patients were able to cope and were
                            discharged. Reverend Parish was involved with 9/11 for another nine
                            months, and it became incorporated into his weekly sermons. It toughened
                            him; he saw such gruesome things and had an intimate view of what
                            happened. He got ID from the Air Force command at Pier 49 or 50 and was
                            asked to “get things organized”. He thought this was a weird thing to
                            ask of a chaplain, but having been a research scientist, he has an
                            innate ability to put things in order; and so he did. He walked the
                            perimeter of the whole site to get an idea of what was going on and to
                            orient himself. While he was circling the site, a body was being
                            extracted and he blessed the body. There was a temporary morgue where
                            the priests blessed the bodies before they were taken to the Medical
                            Examiners – he found out who this first body was but it was a mistake to
                            cross the line from Disaster Care to Family Care; he learned the man’s
                            name and a little bit about his family. He never asked again for
                            identifications of bodies found. He helped found Disaster Chaplaincy
                            Services to assist the Red Cross since they are not a religious group.
                            They found many body parts, but mostly bones. The fires were constantly
                            smoldering and there was a strong smell of decay. This, Joe says, was
                            not as traumatic because “the people were no longer suffering”. What
                            does remain with him to this day is the sound of the SCUD packs beeping,
                            representing all the FDNY who did not get out. Reverend Parish was
                            debriefed many months after the fact, and “cried for the first lump” he
                            had blessed. 9/11 has changed the way EMS and Police are treated, how
                            they are debriefed – they try to get as many chaplains as possible to
                            help. It made us more aware of the consequences of trauma, “people
                            working on the edge of life and death – how do they debrief and go on?”
                            The helpers need to be helped, can’t just slough it off. Joe states we
                            must do what we can for each other, to actively listen and to be
                            compassionate. “Think locally but act globally. As long as we have the
                            Haves and the Have Nots this can happen again; the pass/fail mentality
                            must come to an end, we’re all the same.” Joe states we need to be more
                            sensitized to the needs of others, to be considerate During his first
                            shift at a hospital caring for terminal patients, he had five deaths in
                            one night – a real “trial by fire”. He seemed to “always have the tough
                            stuff” during his ministry, and having been a research scientist was

                            hospital. He went to Bellevue at 5:30pm but they didn’t need any help.
                            He began to think, where would the injured be taken? He walked to Trauma
                            One at St. Vincent’s and the police let him through the barriers because
                            of his priest garb. He couldn’t find the Chaplain’s office – every flat
                            surface was covered with sheets to be ready for the expected injured,
                            but no one came in. He didn’t really grasp it yet – it was all or none;
                            either you got out and were fine or you died. He found the Chaplain and
                            was given a list of the “most traumatized people” to help – which in
                            turn traumatized him: people burned head to toe; an elevator repair man
                            who had free-fallen 12 stories when the cable snapped and survived; a
                            fireman who was the only survivor in his company. He worked one day on,
                            one day off in order to have time to decompress and heal. He stayed at
                            St. Vincent’s for about three weeks until all his patients were able to
                            cope and were discharged. Reverend Parish was involved with 9/11 for
                            another nine months, and it became incorporated into his weekly sermons.
                            It toughened him; he saw such gruesome things and had an intimate view
                            of what happened. He got ID from the Air Force command at Pier 49 or 50
                            and was asked to “get things organized”. He thought this was a weird
                            thing to ask of a chaplain, but having been a research scientist, he has
                            an innate ability to put things in order; and so he did. He walked the
                            perimeter of the whole site to get an idea of what was going on and to
                            orient himself. While he was circling the site, a body was being
                            extracted and he blessed the body. There was a temporary morgue where
                            the priests blessed the bodies before they were taken to the Medical
                            Examiners – he found out who this first body was but it was a mistake to
                            cross the line from Disaster Care to Family Care; he learned the man’s
                            name and a little bit about his family. He never asked again for
                            identifications of bodies found. He helped found Disaster Chaplaincy
                            Services to assist the Red Cross since they are not a religious group.
                            They found many body parts, but mostly bones. The fires were constantly
                            smoldering and there was a strong smell of decay. This, Joe says, was
                            not as traumatic because “the people were no longer suffering”. What
                            does remain with him to this day is the sound of the SCUD packs beeping,
                            representing all the FDNY who did not get out. Reverend Parish was
                            debriefed many months after the fact, and “cried for the first lump” he
                            had blessed. 9/11 has changed the way EMS and Police are treated, how
                            they are debriefed – they try to get as many chaplains as possible to
                            help. It made us more aware of the consequences of trauma, “people
                            working on the edge of life and death – how do they debrief and go on?”
                            The helpers need to be helped, can’t just slough it off. Joe states we
                            must do what we can for each other, to actively listen and to be
                            compassionate. “Think locally but act globally. As long as we have the
                            Haves and the Have Nots this can happen again; the pass/fail mentality
                            must come to an end, we’re all the same.” Joe states we need to be more
                            sensitized to the needs of others, to be considerate Reverend Parish
                            grew up in Knoxville, TN. He was interested in the Ministry while in
                            High School but at the time was a Baptist, and decided that was not the
                            way to go. He loved science and earned a PhD from Harvard Medical
                            School. He discovered the current treatment for Parkinson Disease; “I
                            didn’t get the patent (smiling) so there’s no money, but I helped
                            hundreds of thousands of people.” He also attended Harvard Business
                            School, where he met his wife. He has a love of creativity, and received
                            a Creativity Award while at Harvard for the writing the parody “Cheap
                            Gas”, which is still in production today. In 1972 his life changed
                            dramatically when his father died tragically in a house fire. His mother
                            was pulled out of the fire, but weather dead or alive he didn’t know. He
                            arrived at the hospital to find her sitting up and smiling; a pastor
                            came and prayed with them and he felt a tremendous spiritual energy –
                            “like lightening had struck” and his life was changed forever.

       The responder is a resident of Fair Haven, N.J. who was involved in the
                            volunteer first aid response in New York and New Jersey, and the bucket
                            brigade on the debris pile at Ground Zero. She and her squad were
                            deployed on the day of the attack to the Highlands Docks in New Jersey,
                            but the following day they arrived at the site itself. Since she was not
                            professionally trained in medicine beyond first aid, and she comments
                            that first aid injuries were relatively uncommon, she actually spent the
                            majority of her time in the bucket brigade rather than the medical
                            center. She also performed “morgue runs,” transferring human remains for
                            identification. She fixates on a couple of particular items found at the
                            site, including shoes, stuffed animals, and a pristine business card.
                            All of these items seem to have had an effect on her psyche both
                            on-site, and at home. She relates the story of how after finding the WTC
                            nursery in the rubble, the bucket brigade was pulling beanie babies out
                            of the ash and debris, and after going how that day she broke down and
                            cried for hours at the thought that so many children might have lost
                            their lives. Ultimately, she did not return to the site after the Friday
                            following the attack, after being emotionally and physically overwhelmed
                            that day by the smell of decomposing human remains. She relates that her
                            spirituality has waxed since then, and that she tries to do what is
                            right, even if it is sometimes a struggle for her. In particular, she
                            states that she has a hard time interacting with Middle Eastern and
                            Muslim individuals, despite recognizing that neither group is inherently
                            dangerous. She says she is working on her prejudices, but that it is an
                            ongoing process.

       Alan was born in the Bronx, but grew up here on Long Island in Levittown
                            from 1954. His father worked in television as a radio technician for
                            WNYC and his mother was a homemaker. Alan enjoyed his childhood in the
                            50’s and 60’s with just him and his brother. He graduated high school in
                            1968 and went to college for a year before joining the Army Reserves.
                            After the Army, Alan joined the post office while waiting to be admitted
                            to FDNY. He worked with them for 7 years before transitioning to Nassau
                            Corrections for an additional 3 years. Alan was then finally allotted a
                            position within the New York Fire Department. He stated, “all little
                            boys wanna be firemen”, and in March of 1979 he achieved his dream.
                            Within FDNY, Alan started at Flatbrush, transferred to Hazardous
                            Materials for 3 years, and finished the remainder of his career (an
                            additional 13-14 years) in Time Square. He retired in 2002. On September
                            11, 2001, Alan was on vacation. He was listening to the radio when news
                            of the attacks were first released. He turned on the television just in
                            time to see the second plane hit the tower. At the time he thought to
                            himself, “this is not good”. He called Dan Callahan within the FDNY and
                            took the train into the city. The only other people on the LIRR were
                            other firemen, policemen, and health care workers. Before admittance
                            into the city, they were held in the train station in order for squads
                            to first clear the tunnels of potential bombs. When he finally reached
                            the city, he noted fire, damage, and chaos. “Absolute chaos.” In the
                            months following the attacks, he played as part of a bagpipe band along
                            with other firemen. Together, they played funerals and other receptions.
                            One of his most fond memories was of a few men, “derelicts”. Alan
                            noticed from his firehouse that these men managed to pick up a large
                            replica of the Statue of Liberty and carried it over to his firehouse.
                            They then put a flag on it and saluted. He recalls it was a nice sight
                            to see. Since 9/11, Alan has worked part-time as a docent for the
                            Tribute Center where he started in the information center but has since
                            graduated to walking tours. He tells his own personal stories of what
                            happened that day. He finished by saying that he doesn’t want people to
                            forget about what happened. “We want it to live on in history”.

                            of 7 in a blended family and has worked for the last 9 years as a
                            paramedic for Stony Brook Hospital. She is also a volunteer with the

                            in her dorm when her mom called and told her to put on the television.
                            She watched the first tower collapse. At the time, she was a volunteer
                            for the Setauket Fire Department, so she called them to see if anything
                            was happening. Then she called the ambulance company she worked with and
                            they said they would be going in. Kathryn finally went in the next
                            Sunday, 9/16/2001, after many false starts. They went from Holbrook to
                            Chelsea Pier. They took a wrong turn somewhere and the pile ended up
                            being directly ahead of them. She remembers it looked like an enormous
                            pile of garbage, literally stories high. Lower Manhattan was a mess,
                            absolute chaos. People were running around everywhere trying to do
                            stuff, vehicles with lights everywhere, dust everywhere, and just a huge
                            pile of rubble. It was like a scene out of a movie. The rest of
                            Manhattan was almost normal, “so you’re just driving and then all of a
                            sudden there’s this ginormous pile of rubble.” As a very young
                            responder, only 19 years old, the fact that people were just going to
                            work like it was any other day, but just didn’t come home. She remembers
                            thinking, “I don’t have anything.” She married within a year and a half,
                            and had a child a few years later. “I just kind of like got on this
                            accelerated lifecycle” because she was very aware of how quickly
                            everything could be taken away. She feels that she “went from being,
                            like, a 19 year old, to being a 30 year old, within a couple hours.”
                            Kathryn explains how training has changed and evolved since 9/11. Prior,
                            they would be trained almost jokingly to “watch out for unruly family
                            members” and now there is an emphasis on protecting themselves and
                            looking out for anything suspicious and weapons of mass destruction. She
                            says the perception has moved from – oh be careful, someone might punch
                            you or something, to “you think it’s a normal call and everything’s
                            gonna explode.” She said they were all paranoid for a while. When asked
                            what she would like future generations to take away from her story,
                            Kathryn states that she’d like them to remember that the people who died
                            were just going to work, they do it every single day, and that day they
                            didn’t get to go home.

       Ken was born in Lake Ronkonkoma, New York. His father and grandfather
                            were also born in Lake Ronkonkoma, and his family has served as
                            volunteer firefighters in the Ronkonkoma department since 1923. Ken
                            works for the Teamsters Local 282, and married his high school
                            sweetheart. Ken says he had a perfect life until 9/11 – “pretty good
                            life going on.” On September 11th, Ken was working for an industrial
                            plumbing company and heard about the attacks on the radio. The boss
                            called all the big trucks back to the yard, and they could see the smoke
                            from the Long Island Expressway. When they got back, he heard from
                            Nassau County Fire Department that they were preparing to go to the
                            city, and his boss told him to go home. Ken was nervous to pick up his
                            kids from school, everyone was acting crazy. He arranged for them to be
                            picked up at the bus stop and reported to the Ronkonkoma fire house. The
                            Heavy Rescue Truck was called to go into the city. Only experienced men
                            went; he let his wife know he was going, and the last thing she said to
                            him was, “Don’t go.” Around Exit 49 westbound on the Long Island
                            Expressway, the fire trucks started lining up. A Deer Park Water truck
                            pulled up next to them, and they took all the water they could fit in
                            the truck. They made their way to Brooklyn, and he was able to call his
                            wife on a pay phone. She said, “I really asked you not to go” and his
                            reply was placating, oh it will be ok, they’ll keep us here. They were
                            dispatched to the site, and by the time they reached Soho they started
                            seeing people walking. It looked like a war zone. The truck was stopped
                            by a man looking for security documentation, and Ken saw the rooftops
                            were lined with snipers. It was starting to hit him – “What the heck is
                            going on?” – He couldn’t wrap his head around it. Guys were completely
                            covered in grey dust. Six members of their crew were sent to the pile by
                            Lord and Taylor. He helped unload the trucks, and thought it looked like
                            a nuclear winter. They “put a cop on my truck [for security]” and they
                            were told to search: “Search? Search for what?! … Bodies.” They didn’t
                            find anything at first, but all of a sudden they found a pile with red
                            blood pouring out of the dust. Ken almost got sick; it looked like fresh
                            snow, and he saw a random red Sharpie pen in the dust – it was crazy, he
                            couldn’t tell the difference between the red blood and the red pen,
                            everything was so completely out of place. “This is the most effed up
                            thing I’ve ever seen – couldn’t fathom it.” They proceeded to the pile
                            with the Stokes basked filled with hand tools and equipment. It was like
                            entering a junk pile. Ladder 134 was out in the middle of the pile
                            trying to work; “It looked like something out of a Transformer Movie.”
                            They kept searching and still didn’t see anything. Around 1:00am they
                            were served lunch: a roll with lettuce on it. “Oh well, we were happy to
                            get it!” They sat on the front bumper of his truck and he thought he
                            might have fallen asleep, because out of nowhere a priest walks up to
                            him with two guys next to him and says, ”Bless you son, you’re doing
                            God’s work.” Ken kind of rubbed his face with his hands, and when he
                            looked up they were gone. They were sent to the pile by the morgue,
                            where it was horrible, worse than the worst horror movie. After about a
                            day, the NYFD released them. They were covered in dust. They dropped
                            some firefighters off, treating one with a broken arm. At the fire
                            house, families ran towards the truck yelling, “Who’s on the truck?”
                            They were looking for their husbands. Ken thought, “So sad, oh shit.”
                            They arrived back at Exit 49 Eastbound on the Long Island Expressway
                            where a coffee truck fed them. The coffee guy said they smelled really
                            bad. When he got home, the kids ran towards him but said, “Eeew you
                            smell really bad!” His wife says to this day she will never forget that
                            smell. New Year’s Eve 2006 Ken began coughing up blood and black mucus.
                            He ended up in the Emergency Room and was told it was pneumonia, but it
                            kept happening. Since then, he has been hospitalized at Stony Brook
                            University Hospital 43 times. There was a spongy mass on top of his lung
                            that they couldn’t identify. At 46 years of age he was diagnosed with
                            Prostate Cancer and he asked the doctors if it could be World Trade
                            Center related; the doctors said no. One doctor finally said it might be
                            9/11 related, and he once heard an MRI tech say “Holy shit!” when
                            looking at his results. After that exclamation, he saw the doctors who
                            told him his thyroid was enlarged. Ken acknowledged he already knew
                            this. The doctor’s reply was, “No, no – it’s GIGANTIC.” He had his
                            thyroid removed. What should have been a three hour surgery ended up
                            taking eight: his thyroid was the size of a baby’s head – “How did
                            nobody see this?!” The mass surrounding the thyroid was benign, but the
                            thyroid itself was cancerous and Ken began radiation treatment. Finally
                            on February 14, 2013 he came to the World Trade Center Health Program
                            after he had spoken to [Senior Member Outreach and Education Specialist]
                            Sonia Fore at the Union Hall. “This place is a Godsend.” Since coming he
                            feels so much better, feels that everyone cares for him; “Dr. Karnik is
                            outstanding beyond belief, and [Social Worker] Nancy Campo always
                            answers my calls.” Ken states that prior to coming to the program, he
                            spent between $350.00 and $400.00 a month on copays, and now it’s all
                            taken care of for him. On April 23rd Ken had an asthma attack that kept
                            him in ICU for five days. He was discharged, and ended up back in two
                            days. Finally returning to work, he began spitting up blood and was
                            hospitalized another 14 days; the doctors finally told him he has 9/11
                            Lung Disease because they couldn’t figure out what is wrong with him.
                            His wife kept saying, “We gotta figure this out!” He had the worst
                            asthma attack yet, was uncontrollably shaking, and was in the hospital
                            for five days. He had “bad doctors who wouldn’t listen” and he began to
                            get upset. A Hospital Advocate came to talk to him – Ken had been
                            pretending to sleep, and opened his eyes to find a Pastor standing
                            there. Ken was astonished: “I know you – were you at 9/11? Did you have,
                            like, two guys with you? Walking around blessing guys?” This was Pastor
                            Steve, the man who had blessed Ken when he fell asleep on the bumper of
                            his fire truck down on the pile on September 11th. They cried together,
                            and Pastor Steve said, “Come with me and we’ll go to a place where they
                            know us [fellow responders].” Thirteen years later, he had always
                            thought it was a dream but it was Pastor Steve. Ken finally began to
                            feel hope. Ken began to speak with Dr. Sharma for mental health therapy,
                            and he highly recommends it. “You think you’re rough and tough; you
                            gotta go. Home is so much better now – no more walking on eggshells
                            around Daddy.” His wife said 9/11 was a marriage changer and she could
                            have divorced him many times over the years, but after seeing Dr. Sharma
                            he is finally back to “the old me”. “Thank God for the program – where
                            would I be? Everything I need is handed to me.” Ken says there is good,
                            there is bad; he witnessed looting and saw pure humanity. Every time
                            something goes wrong with him, he remembers his wife’s words to him:
                            “Please don’t go.” But Ken says, “I’m a fireman, that’s what I do, I had
                            to go.” “This 9/11 stuff is rough. I hope down the years it’s not like a
                            Labor Day Sale; the 9/11 stickers on cars are faded. We need a voice,
                            guys are dying left and right - at least I’m walking and talking”. There
                            is a memorial wall in the town of Nesconset close to Ken’s home, and he
                            won’t drive by it. “I don’t want to be a name on a wall.”

       Terrence is retired from the New York City Department of Corrections and
                            lives in New Hide Park, New York. On the morning of September 11th,
                            Terrance was the commanding officer of the New York Justice Bureau in
                            the Department of Corrections. He had just come out of a meeting, and
                            heard on the radio that a plane had hit one of the towers. His son was
                            an auxiliary police officer at the time, and his daughter worked in the
                            World Financial Center across the street from the towers. Thankfully,
                            his daughter had not reported to work yet and his son had called in
                            sick, but Terrence describes the initial instinct to go directly there
                            to try and find him because he was unable to reach his son by phone. At
                            the time they didn’t realize just how fortunate they were. When Terrance
                            reported to the site, he was asked to work in the Medical Examiner’s
                            Office, to help bring the bodies to the doctors for forensic
                            examinations. He describes in vivid detail the emotional stress of
                            dealing with this task. He was able to arrange for counselors to come
                            and mingle with the officers, offering them the opportunity to talk if
                            they wanted to. He also arranged for this to be ‘off the record’ so
                            there would be no professional repercussions. Terrance realizes now,
                            looking back, that they were all affected much more than they knew at
                            the time. The events of September 11th have given Terrance a new
                            perspective and clarity on family and the blessing of family time. He
                            states that the most important thing you can do is to forget all the
                            nonsense and focus on family time.

       Richard is a second generation FDNY firefighter, his father is a retired
                            FDNY Captain. On 9/11/2001, he had already retired from FDNY because he
                            had sustained severe injuries from a collapsed burning building. After
                            retirement, Richard went back to school and earned his Master’s Degree
                            in Mental Health. He became a licensed Mental Health Counselor. At the
                            time of the attacks, he was working as a volunteer Grief Counselor,
                            which was organized through Suffolk County. Richard’s experience with
                            major crises included Flight 800 and the 1993 WTC bombing, and his 22
                            years served as a NYC Firefighter. Richard first learned of the attack
                            while at work in the Lee Dennison Bldg in Hauppauge. He saw the footage
                            on TV. It reminded him of when the Empire State Bldg was hit by a Bomber
                            plane in the 1940’s. When he saw the Tower was hit by a jet, he knew it
                            was a terrorist attack. He expected fiery destruction, and thought the
                            top of the building would topple over and fall, but he never expected
                            the towers to implode and collapse. Richard’s first clients were family
                            members who came in hoping to get information on their loved ones who
                            were FDNY/NYPD, but they didn’t have any information to give them.
                            Everything was chaotic. Then the Port Authority Medical Division called
                            Richard and his partner to NYC. Richard didn’t want to go, he had
                            already worked major traumatic events, so he felt he had “been there,
                            done that”. Richard was on “auto-pilot” and initially worked 24 hrs.
                            straight. He made himself available to anyone who needed him. He was one
                            of them, and knew the only thing the First Responders needed to do was
                            get back to the site and find their coworkers. He didn’t give anyone
                            “psycho-babble,” only practical checks to ensure that they operating in
                            the correct state of mind. Richard was eventually transferred to the
                            tents that were set up for the morgue. He walked around all day, back
                            and forth, and waited for First Responders to “invite him in” before he
                            began to give any advice or counseling. He feels to appropriately
                            counsel, you need to not be intrusive, but get permission first. In
                            April of 2002, he was asked to work with NYPD and lead groups meetings,
                            which was nicknamed “tissue patrol.” He educated the officers on
                            critical incidents, symptoms of PTSD and stress management. Even though
                            Richard was good at helping others with their trauma, he was not good
                            taking care of himself. He allowed himself to get burnt out and suffers
                            from PTSD. He has isolated himself from everyone around him except for
                            his dog. He has lost interest in work and connecting with people. He has
                            sought counseling and is being treated for his PTSD, which also has
                            physical components. He recognized his worse symptoms around 2006 and is
                            still working on getting better. The message that he offers to everyone
                            is that we need to understand First Responders. Know your place. Don’t
                            ask how they feel, don’t get in their face, and don’t touch them. Just
                            be a presence, and be trusted.

       Shermayne was born in New York but moved to Portsmouth Virginia when she
                            was six years old. Her mom and stepfather owned a supermarket and flea
                            market, and owned a modest home. Her stepfather was abusive towards her
                            mother and in 1983, not wanting another child raised in that situation,
                            her mom packed up the kids and moved back to Manhattan. The stepfather
                            tried to gain custody of her two brothers, but was unsuccessful and it
                            took him a while to accept that. In the end, “karma came back” and he
                            spent 10 years in jail. On September 11th, Shermayne was working for the
                            New York City Police Transit Department in District 2. She was living in
                            an apartment in Manhattan, and was at home watching a DVD when her
                            partner called to tell her of the attacks. Her reaction was, “Yeah,
                            right!” but she turned on the news and was shocked. She was very fearful
                            because her sister worked in a building right across from the Trade
                            Center. She was afraid for her co-workers and friends, as District 2
                            covered the area including the Trade Center. She was hysterical as she
                            watched the towers fall. Shermayne’s brother committed suicide at 18
                            years of age and she had identified the body; she was a nervous wreck
                            until her sister made it back to her apartment – she didn’t feel she
                            could take another loss. Her sister had forgotten something and was
                            running late so she was not at the site. Whenever Shermayne took a cab
                            to work, she always knew when she was close because she could see the
                            towers. But they were not there and reality set in – “They really are
                            not there anymore.” She was still hoping and praying that no one had
                            lost their lives; “I knew it was bad but hopefully not too
                            many….hopefully not too many that I know…” She was full of fear. Once
                            she was sure the family was all okay, she was able to focus and get
                            ready for what had to be done at work. Her partner lived on Long Island
                            and came to pick her up. They checked in at command and were told to get
                            a pair of gloves and bag all the grey dust-covered clothing that the
                            returning officers were wearing – they didn’t know what the clothing
                            might have been contaminated with. Shermayne walked to where the mangled
                            center of the pile was. There were so many fires and people digging,
                            sifting; so many people working that she didn’t even know who to ask
                            what needed to be done. She tried to find a high ranking officer to find
                            out what to do and was assigned to security by the National Guard to
                            stop the looting and secure the crime scene. The smells were bad and
                            they wore masks for a short while. They got masks on 9/12; after they
                            had worn those masks for two weeks they were told “those masks are no
                            good!” and they got better masks. But the smell was still there for
                            months. There were still hot spots, and alarms would sound regularly – a
                            co-worker of hers broke his leg running when an alarm went off. In 2002,
                            Shermayne was feeling sick and went to the doctor because of pain in her
                            back. She was diagnosed with sarcoidosis and lung nodules in July of
                            that year. She had to go on hormones and gained a lot of weight. She was
                            taken off the streets for health reasons. Shermayne had been told that
                            she would never have children. In 2006 she went to a normal
                            gynecological visit. She was very irritated with the staff, because
                            things seemed to be taking so long, but it turned out they had a
                            surprise for her: she was pregnant. She was unbelievably happy. At her
                            sixth month visit, she went for a sonogram and could see from the
                            doctor’s face that something was wrong. The doctor couldn’t see a
                            heartbeat and there was no movement. She just screamed hysterically. She
                            had to be dilated to deliver the child, a little girl. Everything was
                            just “blah, blah blah…” she couldn’t comprehend anything and just wanted
                            to go home. It took hours to deliver, and was just so hard. The doctor
                            called, and said they had performed an autopsy; the sarcoidosis had
                            formed clots in the placenta and this caused the baby’s death. “When
                            everyone tells you it’s God’s will, it’s hard to hear and find out there
                            was something that would have prevented it (blood thinners). Why would
                            God give me this gift and then take it away? It was 9/11 that took away
                            my gift.” Looking back, she was very depressed. Because of her brother’s
                            suicide, she never considered that; but she would see drug users on the
                            street who were pregnant, “Why do they get to keep their baby?” She
                            began drinking heavily until her boyfriend told her to channel the grief
                            away from the alcohol or she would lose him too. She tried to get a
                            handle on it. Eventually she decided to try and have another baby. She
                            brought ovulation kits, but never got a positive reading. About a year
                            later, she set a date at a fertility clinic to have a procedure done. A
                            week before that appointment, she went on a Lobster Fest trip – but she
                            ate so much she felt sick, which was unusual, “I’m a pro!” On a whim she
                            took a pregnancy test, and she was pregnant. Shermayne's new doctor knew
                            her conditions, and the first thing she did was begin a regiment of baby
                            aspirin with her prenatal vitamin. It was such a blessing, “all it took
                            was a baby aspirin and I have my angel now.” Even now, she gets sad
                            sometimes, frustrated that her daughter should have had a big sister.
                            The way the smoke was always burning, she just doesn’t know if a better
                            mask would have helped. A lot of guys she worked with have developed
                            asthma and Zadroga graduated in the same academy class with her. She
                            states it makes her wonder, but 9/11 is over “and people don’t
                            understand that it’s still going on – look at me, lung disease and a
                            lost pregnancy.” She is always anxious, “on point” – 9/11 has
                            contributed to these things. It’s also a cop thing, but she’s more
                            cautious, fearful; she has to be able to see the door when sitting in a
                            restaurant. She retired in 2012 for her daughter. She and her partner
                            were always in and out, passing each other and changing shifts. “I don’t
                            know why God took so many lives but spared mine, but I know it was to be
                            her mommy.” Shermayne was diagnosed with thyroid cancer when her
                            daughter was three years old. She thought, “Now I have 9/11 related
                            cancer, here we go again…I can’t win, when it is going to stop?” Her
                            thyroid was removed and she now will take medicine for the rest of her
                            life. She has had breast and bladder cancer scares, “Ok, what’s going to
                            be next?!” It’s always in the back of her mind that something else could
                            happen. On September 11th, everyone went to work like it was any other
                            day, but you just never know. She tries not to take everything to heart.
                            “Life is too short, why hold on to the bad?” She has a different kind of
                            work now with her daughter, and to see the smile on her daughters face
                            when Shermayne can participate at her school makes it all worth it.

       Marta Moya-Goldenberg is an immigrant from Ecuador who came to the US in
                            1968. She was unable to get her education in her homeland, but when she
                            came to America, she continued her education and earned her Master’s
                            Degree and became a clinical social worker. Marta was widowed twice and
                            has two daughters and five grandchildren. On the day of 9/11, Marta was
                            living in Plymouth, MA working as a social worker at a dialysis center.
                            She had a nephew who was NYPD and she feared for his safety. She was on
                            the phone wishing her brother a happy birthday when she saw the TV
                            footage of the first plane crash. Her love for America runs so deep that
                            her heart was broken and she needed to come to NY to help in some way.
                            Marta headed to NYC on 9/12/01, directly to the Salvation Army and Red
                            Cross to serve as a bilingual social worker. She wanted to be there for
                            the Spanish speaking people who would be grieving and needing support.
                            Marta continued to volunteer for several months Wednesday through Sunday
                            in NYC and then returned to Plymouth to work her job on Monday and
                            Tuesday. Marta did get the good news that her nephew was safe. Her
                            family supported her efforts and knew that her faith in God and her
                            dedication to serving humanity could not keep her from the site. She
                            felt she would have lost her mind if she couldn’t help in some capacity.
                            She was also assigned to help out in special financial centers that
                            provided assistance to those in need. Marta’s various stories were about
                            different individuals who suffered losses. Their losses ranged from
                            missing/losing their loved ones to losing their business and livelihood,
                            and those who were ridden with guilt because they survived. She felt
                            especially bad for the workers in the pit who despite the danger, were
                            earning money for their families, which kept them working long hours and
                            subjecting themselves to the toxic fumes and debris. She saw many acts
                            of heroism and heard so many stories of people helping each other. Marta
                            did not used protective equipment because she was told that since they
                            worked inside it would not be necessary because the air quality was fine
                            indoors. Eventually, she did get chest pain and asthma symptoms. Marta’s
                            faith allows her to remain optimistic for our society. She does feel
                            that we have now, so many years later, we have become laissez faire. She
                            hopes the future generations will learn to talk and not destroy each
                            other.

       Michael is a volunteer Captain in the Nesconset, New York fire department
                            and is also a sworn Deputy Sheriff. He owned two magazine publications,
                            and is currently retired living on Long Island. Michael had heard that
                            two planes crashed into the towers while he was at a business breakfast.
                            Two hours his pager (for the fire department) began going off, but he
                            missed going to the site with the first rig, so he went on September
                            12th using his press and Sheriff credentials to travel to the site. He
                            took the Safety Officer of the Nesconset FD with him. Driving in was
                            “really bad”, they could start smelling the site when they reached the
                            Midtown Tunnel. Security was tight, they were repeatedly asked to show
                            their credentials and it was chaotic. The scene was mind boggling.
                            People were running all over, some handing out small paper masks. A girl
                            gave Michael a regulator mask, saying the paper masks were useless.
                            After about an hour he changed the filter and it was covered in half an
                            inch of dust. Michael was sent to go on the line to take down debris.
                            While doing this, two bodies were discovered and they were carried down
                            the pile hand to hand. He recalls it felt “weird…not a casket, just a
                            body – I could feel the bones, there was no flesh left.” It was like
                            nothing he had ever faced before. He was on the bucket brigade all day,
                            and it was scary walking on the hot steamy terrain. All around the
                            perimeter of the site there were about 25 tripods with cameras to check
                            the stability of the surrounding buildings. An alarm would trigger if
                            the buildings shifted, and it was scary to try and get off the mound
                            because it would take about fifteen minutes to get to safety. The first
                            and second days at the site Michael worked 11 to 12 hour shifts, taking
                            a lot of photographs to document history; when he looks at them now he
                            feels like he’s there again. By the fourth day, things were starting to
                            get organized and the FBI came in to set up a command post. He got FBI
                            clearance so his movements could be tracked and so he could have access
                            to the whole site. The days became redundant and he became aware how bad
                            it was – trucks were being washed before they were permitted to leave
                            the site, but “dust goes down the drain, drain goes to the ground, where
                            is all this dust going? Everything filters down the drain, down the
                            line.” This experience changed his whole life – Michael states 9/11
                            either saved his life or could have taken his life. The World Trade
                            Center Monitoring Program saved his life. He was getting headaches and
                            had ringing in his ears. He went to doctors and ENT specialists, all
                            saying it was nothing, they couldn’t find anything wrong with him. After
                            a year of seeing specialists, he came into the Islandia clinic for a
                            monitoring appointment and told the doctor about the ringing in his
                            ears. The doctor at the clinic sent him for an MRI, and by 9:30 the next
                            day Stony Brook was on the phone telling him to come to the hospital
                            right away. There was a tumor on his ear drum the size of a golf ball.
                            “The WTC doc saw me for 20 minutes and found it.” It didn’t look
                            cancerous, but needed to come out so that it didn’t grow into his brain.
                            A three inch diameter hole was cut into his skull to remove it; there
                            were complications during the surgery and his wife gave the go-ahead to
                            take his ear drum out despite possible nerve damage. Three nerves were
                            ruptured during the surgery and he now has Bell’s palsy. “Looks
                            terrible, just a mess.” Michael was in the hospital for 7-8 days, had
                            rehabilitation to learn to walk, talk, eat, see; his entire face had to
                            be rebuilt. His ninth (and last) operation was on 9/2/2014 so that he
                            can blink his eye again, and evened out his face so the wrinkles are the
                            same on each side. He states emphatically, everyone is a hero in their
                            own way. Everyone who helped, anyone who donated – they’re back up for
                            the 40,000 fire fighters. They’re the heroes; one football player
                            doesn’t win the game. Anyone who made an effort to help is a hero. “I’m
                            just a little pea in the pod.” Michael states that the government is not
                            protecting the 9/11 responders. Guys are getting sicker, no one is
                            getting financial help, many conditions are not covered and disability
                            is not offered. “This changed my life, I was done after my operation
                            (unable to work).” Michael feels that approving and disapproving
                            benefits needs to be looked at. “This is the start of terrorism in the
                            United States – will it ever stop? In my opinion, NO. Only a matter of
                            time before they do it again. We’re doing the best we can to stop it.”

                            after the event, his fire department was slated to bring in ten
                            volunteers, so ten men plus the chief went down at 4:00 pm. They arrived
                            at the site around 8:30 that night, after waiting for a liaison from
                            NYFD to bring them to their staging site. Joseph describes in vivid
                            detail the rubble, mind-boggling devastation and the smell permeating
                            the site. His team’s job was to assist with two fired department teams
                            who had Search and Rescue dogs. Joe briefly describes the tasks of the
                            dogs and the differences between a ‘live’ dog and a ‘cadaver’ dog. Joe
                            recounts the emotional numbness and shock of being at the site, and
                            compares the process of dealing with this to his time serving in
                            Vietnam. He speaks of forgiveness, and the necessity of choosing to be a
                            positive, happy person and not giving in to the anger and depression
                            that surrounds the memories. He speaks about how the experience has
                            changed his life for the better, and he hopes that the people who
                            adversely affected find ‘a way out’.

       Teddy begins his interview by stating, “We need to have history tell the
                            truth.” Ted was born in Puerto Rico, and the Imbasciani family moved to
                            New York in 1974. He grew up in the town of Huntington, and was a Marine
                            before joining the New York City Police Department. On September 11th,
                            he was attending a class to take the Sargent’s test. They received
                            reports of planes hitting the buildings, but Teddy thought “oh the
                            Manhattan guys will take care of it.” Someone brought a television into
                            the room, and then they began to see and understand how bad it was.
                            Eventually the class was dismissed and everyone made their way to their
                            own commands; Ted’s was Brooklyn North (79th Precinct). By the time they
                            arrived at the site that evening, both towers were down and it was
                            chaotic and surreal – he felt that the world has changed. He remembers
                            thinking – is this what the moon’s surface looks like? “It looked like
                            Beirut in 1983 after the bombings; but no…this was worse. Just the
                            destruction and loss of civilians.” Teddy spent some time trying to find
                            direction. He finally met a Captain and linked up with some guys from
                            emergency services; eventually they became separated. Around midnight, a
                            Port Authority officer was found alive so the workers began to have some
                            hope. The officer was placed on a back board and the hands reached up
                            one by one to get him out. There was a sense of hope that they would
                            begin to find more, but he was the only person found alive; after that
                            there was just body parts and pieces of people. When the sun came up,
                            the black became grey. Teddy went to the temporary Headquarters at a
                            Burger King where guys were eating cheese on buns among the filth. This
                            was the first thing he got to eat so far – he was always thirsty and
                            stick. A PBA (Police Benevolence Association) truck came by and Teddy
                            was recognized as a union rep – he told them they needed masks and
                            water. He was given a mask, “Not a good one, but it was something.”
                            Eleven days straight, Teddy would go with his precinct, come home…go
                            back as a volunteer fire fighter (out of Lakeland, Ronkonkoma), come
                            home…go back with his precinct, etc. He was friends with many
                            firefighters and volunteer firefighters who were missing. Callousness
                            began to set in now; people were just throwing body parts, passing off
                            body parts one to the next. Everyone was desensitized. Teddy felt
                            prepared to deal with this as a Marine, a police officer and a volunteer
                            fire fighter, but still gets upset “when it’s all lumped together.” His
                            wife is also a police officer and came to all the funerals and memorials
                            with him – that became a job in itself. Sometimes he would attend two in
                            one day and it took a toll on a lot of people. The last funeral he
                            remembers attending was for his friend Robbie; Robbie’s mom delayed
                            having the funeral until they had something to bury. What eventually was
                            found was DNA on the gun slide of his police issued 45mm handgun. It
                            never occurred to him to take pictures; he has his memo book and
                            newspaper articles. While at the site, he was always looking down; he
                            has no memories of the iconic skeletal buildings that are pictured
                            everywhere. He says the smell of wet concrete and fire was unique and
                            will always stay with him. When asked if he would go back to help if
                            something like this ever happened again, he replied, “Absolutely!” He
                            believes, looking back, that he should have taken more precautions,
                            maybe covering up more, “but I don’t know, you’re there just doing the
                            work and you can’t’ help people if you can’t get to them.” When asked
                            what he would like future generations to remember, he states that people
                            need to remember. Don’t forget history; we’ve learned a lot from this:
                            first responder programs, how to control a command center,
                            communications lessons learned – but, be careful: other countries
                            already knew this but we had to learn. Don’t be complacent and let your
                            guard down, “there is evil everywhere, keep it in your rear view
                            mirror.”

       Terrence Legrady is currently a Suffolk County Police officer at Shelter
                            Island. On 9/11/01, he was a rookie NYPD at the 102nd Precinct in
                            Queens. He had only been on the force for 1.5 years. He was engaged at
                            that time and his fiancé was a school teacher. His father is also
                            retired NYPD, and has two cousins that are FDNY. The morning of the
                            attacks, Terrence was driving home on the LIE because he worked the
                            night shift. When he got home, his commander called him back in. Being a
                            rookie, he did not really know what to expect, but due to the magnitude
                            of this tragedy, there is no way that anyone could know. He drove back
                            to Manhattan via the LIE HOV lane. There were checkpoints along the way,
                            and then they drove over lawns to get to the precinct. It was strange to
                            Terrence to see everyone in the locker rooms and in the building at one
                            time because he was used to seeing only his platoon. The atmosphere was
                            slightly chaotic, but he was glad to see so many retired cops
                            volunteering, even if it was just to answer the phone. They were
                            assigned their orders according to “levels of mobilization.” His first
                            assignment was security in front of a synagogue in Queens. The community
                            and rabbis were grateful for his presence. He stayed there until the
                            threat was gone. On 9/12/11, their shifts were changed to 16hr (instead
                            of 12hr). He stayed on for his night shift and was assigned to Ground
                            Zero. NYPD buses would transport him from the 107th Precinct. Terrence
                            had worked for two days before he finally was able to go home and see
                            his fiancé and get some sleep. Terrence will never forget and has never
                            experienced anything like it since, the tremendous sense of unity. He
                            and his fellow officers worked in very rough neighborhoods. He was used
                            to being hated and spit on and had dirty diapers thrown at him, but
                            people would come up to him and offer to buy him coffee, people lined up
                            along the FDR Drive clapping and cheering for them. Even the computer
                            surveillance cameras in the patrol cars were quiet because the community
                            had all come together in this time of crisis. Terrence was assigned to
                            “the Pit”. He stated that he has a terrible memory, but everything
                            related to 9/11 has been “etched into his brain”. His first vivid memory
                            was of Trinity Church with all the Missing Person’s flyers. They were
                            allowed to take meal breaks, but mostly everyone forfeited them and
                            helped search for survivors. The enormity of the pit was indescribable.
                            When they blew the horn, everyone had to stop what they were doing,
                            engines turned off, and everything was silenced. They would wait to hear
                            for signs of life. If the horn blew twice, you had to run because
                            another building or structure was going down. Terrence had seen a man
                            climbing a telephone pole so he approached him to assess the situation.
                            The man was from the EPA who was testing the air. The EPA told him that
                            the air was fine, so everyone removed their masks. Terrence saw
                            thousands of rescue workers and no one was wearing masks. Since he
                            worked nights, he was unable to really see how bad it was. After several
                            days, there was a distinct decaying body smell mixed with burnt rubber
                            and metal. Terrence commended the efforts of the Red Cross volunteers.
                            The Red Cross had made a nearby school into a hotel for the rescue
                            workers to rest and eats. They gave him a clean cot with bedding and a
                            mint on the pillow, along with a care package of toiletries; they even
                            provided them with wake up calls. Terrence worked side by side with
                            someone who is just a year younger than him who now has a rare stomach
                            cancer that is attributed to his exposure at 9/11. Terrence is now
                            getting yearly monitoring even though he does not have any major
                            symptoms. He commended the WTC Health and Monitoring Program with having
                            great workers and feels it’s a great program for the First Responders.
                            In 2005, Terrence left NYPD and went to “the County”. His last post as a
                            NYPD officer was at a teacher’s protest on Church and Vesey. It was the
                            first time he had been back since 9/11. It was an odd experience to see
                            everything cleaned up, rebuilt and functioning anew. It was very
                            symbolic for him as he exited and moved on to a better job. Terrence has
                            certain visual, audio and scent “triggers” that bring back vivid
                            memories of 9/11. He does discuss 9/11 with other officers when they are
                            socializing. At each anniversary, he does what he can to commemorate
                            that time in history. He honors those who ran into the burning,
                            collapsing buildings as heroes.

       Ernest grew up in the Bronx and started working for his brother-in-law’s
                            contracting company at the age of 13. From there he started working in
                            construction for NYC at various places, including the New York Public
                            Library, the Museum of Natural History, the NYC transit authority, and
                            the NYC housing authority. On the day of 9/11 Ernest was working for the
                            housing authority in an apartment close to the World Trade Center
                            buildings. A woman in the apartment building told Ernest and his
                            coworkers what had just happened and they rushed to another building
                            they had worked in the past to get a better view of the towers from the
                            building roof. At that time the only form of communication that was
                            still working were their walkie-talkies, where they were hearing a lot
                            of misinformation about other attacks at places like the Mall of America
                            and Washington, D.C. The day after the attacks Ernest went to work,
                            where they received a phone call from the emergency services of NYC
                            saying they needed five carpenters to come to ground zero to build ramps
                            on site, so that the debris trucks would not crush the fire hoses.
                            Ernest and a few of his coworkers first went to buy disposable cameras
                            so that they could document what they were going to see, and then headed
                            to the site, which he described as a “landscape of a nightmare”. Ernest
                            worked at ground zero for two days; while there he could not help but
                            notice how organized it was, and how so many people came together to
                            help. The most memorable moment for him was when he walked past a line
                            of firefighters and caught eyes with each one of them and saw the
                            horrible looks on their faces. After a 14 hour work day, Ernest went
                            home and did not want to go back to the site to work again. Two weeks
                            later he returned to the site with his 9 year old son to see the
                            progress because he thought it was important for his son to see what was
                            going on. Another notable memory of his was that he noticed the FBI
                            agents were wearing gas masks and Tyvec suits, while the responders and
                            other workers were wearing only paper masks. He believed the FBI
                            probably knew something that they didn’t about the hazardous
                            environment. The number of people he knows who have been diagnosed with
                            a health issue after working at ground zero has doubled in recent years.
                            Since 9/11, Ernest is still reminded of the attacks when he sees pieces
                            of the building displayed as memorials, and when he hears fighter jets
                            flying low over Yankee Stadium during opening day. He states “everything
                            has changed”.

       Danny was born and raised in Queens, NY, but now lives with his family in
                            Long Island, NY. His parents emigrated to NY from Italy in their early
                            20s, and had five sons—who all became NYPD officers and 9/11 responders.
                            Danny is the youngest. He was in the NYPD for twenty years; he retired a
                            couple of years ago. Danny credits his lifelong love of soccer with
                            helping to instill values that no group of people is all bad or all
                            good, but that each person must be judged on their own merit. Soccer
                            allowed him to meet and befriend people of all different creeds and
                            races, and he says he even picked up foreign languages on the field. He
                            continued playing throughout adulthood, finding that his knowledge of
                            the game helped him in investigations when trying to build trust with
                            potential informants. After 9/11, the NYPD soccer team he played with
                            collected donations and went on humanitarian trips to places like South
                            America and Korea. An undercover detective in the narcotics division,
                            Danny was asked to join the NYPD intelligence division when it was
                            formed in March 2001. He remarks that it essentially changed over to an
                            anti-terrorism unit after 9/11 occurred, and that the NYPD overall was
                            forever changed. On the morning of 9/11, Danny dropped his infant son
                            off with his caretaker in Queens, where he was still living, and decided
                            to drive his wife to her office in midtown Manhattan, which he didn’t
                            normally do because it made him late to work. As he drove south, he
                            noticed a police car racing by and assumed there had been an incident at
                            the Empire State Building. When the squad car continued downtown, Danny
                            realized his mistake and also noticed the crowd waiting for the bus all
                            looking south instead of (as would be typical) looking in the direction
                            from which the bus would approach. He turned on 1010 WINS and heard the
                            report that planes had crashed into the Towers. When Danny got to his
                            office, only one sergeant was there. They drove to City Hall Park
                            together and found about ten other officers from their precinct. There
                            was chaos around them, and while they waited for word on what to do,
                            they helped bleeding, dust-covered people to ambulances. While they were
                            stationed at the park, the first tower fell, which they couldn’t see
                            because they were too close. The ground vibrated as if there were an
                            earthquake or the street was caving in, and they ran, helping others
                            along the way. He remarks upon the irony of going from running toward
                            the buildings to running away from them and recalls feeling very numb
                            and thinking that the situation was surreal, a word he usually hates.
                            The group of cops felt great frustration at having to stand around when
                            they could have been helping, especially because some of them were
                            trained EMTs. While they were waiting, he walked to Chambers Street to
                            see if he could find a phone. At this point, he says, he seemed to
                            understand that this was a terrorist attack, and he felt incredible
                            urgency to get in touch with his wife and tell her to leave Manhattan as
                            soon as possible, not knowing if more attacks were to come. Despite
                            feelings of helplessness and numbness, Danny felt like he had to act.
                            Although they were told not to go to the Pile, he and another officer
                            joined the bucket brigade in their dress clothes, working for hours. He
                            says that it felt useful in the moment but in retrospect he wonders how
                            much of a difference it made. He says, “It’s like being a lifeguard and
                            there are all these people drowning—who do you help first?” He remembers
                            the endless lines of responders—EMTs, firemen, cops, and civilians. At
                            one point, a man came up to him and fed him a slice of pizza, which is
                            one of the most arresting memories he has of that day. After a few hours
                            on the brigade, they rejoined their squad. The intelligence division
                            made temporary offices in the Intrepid, while the FBI camped out in an
                            adjacent parking structure. Danny’s division was responsible for
                            following up and investigating anything that came through the tip lines,
                            and he recalls how frustrating it was to investigate fruitlessly. They
                            went to the site daily to perform grid searches, looking for any
                            evidence or relevant clues in the rubble. One some days, they had
                            painter’s masks, but often wore no protective covering—only on the day
                            the FBI joined them were they given Tyvek suits. He has little memory of
                            going home or being with his family during this time. After a couple of
                            years of doing this work, he was asked to join a task force to
                            investigate/infiltrate mosques in Harlem, during which time he ran Hamas
                            investigations for 5-6 years and even learned some Arabic. Danny retired
                            spontaneously one day, going to One Police Plaza to file his paperwork,
                            where he met Commissioner Kelly. Although he misses the work, which was
                            a huge part of his identity, he does not miss the frustrations and
                            feeling at times like he cared more than the department did. Despite all
                            being responders, he and his brothers didn’t discuss 9/11 for many
                            years, even when they started becoming ill. He knows now that two
                            brothers have cancer, and he also has health issues and suffers from
                            insomnia. Certain things—like news of what is happening in Gaza—trigger
                            memories for him. He says 9/11 totally reshaped who he is; he has more
                            negative feelings toward the government and feels that in these
                            situations it’s always the regular people who suffer. Danny’s interview
                            had very present themes of equality and cooperation. He insists that he
                            is not a hero, and was raised not to take glory, but simply do his part,
                            which is what he wants his kids and the next generation to do as well.

       Elias Jimenez is an Environmental Engineer for the MTA, and worked on 2
                            Broadway on 9/11/2001. He is a Vietnam Veteran and served as a combat
                            medic. He is a husband, father of two daughters and grandfather. He was
                            raised in CT but graduated in Puerto Rico. He earned his degree at
                            Queens College. He began his career in pharmaceutical sales and then
                            crossed over to engineering. On the morning of the attacks, “Eli” worked
                            on the second floor of his office building across from Liberty Park and
                            the Wall Street Bull. He had heard a faint rumble and then saw paper
                            falling all around when he looked out the window. It looked like
                            confetti, but it wasn’t because the papers were full sheets. He heard
                            that a plane had struck one of the towers, so since he had emergency
                            training, he went outside to see if he could help. He walked to the
                            corner of Vesey and Greenwich and saw a crowd of people. He saw building
                            in flames but the damaged seemed to be contained and there was no real
                            panic. While Eli was standing there, he heard engines overhead, he
                            looked up and saw the under carriage of the second plane. He heard the
                            engines rev just before impact. His thoughts were with the passengers,
                            he had hoped that they weren’t frightened; he knew that they didn’t
                            suffer. It was obvious to him that this was a terrorist attack. He knelt
                            down, cried and was in shock. Silica and debris was falling all around
                            from the disintegrated building and plane. Then Eli felt the earth
                            quake, and then he saw a swarm of people trying to out run a tsunami of
                            greyish white debris. He was blinded by the dust and silica. He was
                            being bombarded by running people as he tried to stand his ground. He
                            had seen many horrific things in Vietnam, but none compared to this
                            destruction of so many innocent lives. It was evident to him that there
                            were no survivors. Eli walked over the Brooklyn Bridge to where his
                            brother-in-law lived. It was a mass exodus over the bridges. He cannot
                            forget the sight of looking over the bridge and seeing the remains of
                            the buildings. It had been reduced to fire and smoke. It took him 3-4
                            hours to get to his brother-in-law’s house. He doesn’t remember how he
                            got home to LI, but when he did, his wife was crying. Eli reported to
                            work the next day, but his building on Broadway was closed. His office
                            relocated on Livingston St, but he convinced his boss that he wouldn’t
                            be productive there, and he would best be served in a triage center. He
                            proved first aid to the workers with callouses and bruises. He worked
                            five days straight for 8-10 hours each day. Then he continued to work
                            the weekends for 6 months after. The Saturday following the attacks, it
                            rained. Eli found a picture of a flag floating down a stream of water
                            down the subway track at the Fulton St station. I was a replica of the
                            US flag with children’s sentiments and signatures all over it. They made
                            it to honor the First Responders. Eli didn’t use his respirator all the
                            time, and the face masks were not helpful and it was difficult to
                            communicate with them on. He saw EPA workers use cassettes to measure
                            the asbestos, but he knew they were ineffective because they would
                            become overloaded due to the amount of silica in the air. Thirteen years
                            later, Eli continues to be affected by the tragedy. He has difficulty
                            sleeping, and has no tolerance for nonsense and stupid things. He still
                            works downtown and sees how everyone’s lives went back to normal as if
                            nothing had happened. He is grateful to have had the opportunity to
                            volunteer.

       Alan grew up in Brooklyn, New York. He has been married for thirty-five
                            years and has two kids. Alan currently lives in Plainview, New York. He
                            attended Brooklyn College for his undergraduate and graduate degrees. At
                            first, Alan was a Pre-med major but later switched to television and
                            radio production. Alan worked at Corporate TV and ABC TV for seven
                            years. The majority of Alan’s career was with Credit Swiss First Boston
                            where he served as a Vice President for training. He currently works for
                            a pharmaceutical company that produces generic pharmaceuticals in
                            Hauppauge, New York. During 9/11, Alan was working in building 5 at the
                            World Trade Center. His job at the time was a director of training for
                            Credit Swiss First Boston. Alan’s job function was to move people around
                            from office to office. He started the day in the company’s Madison
                            Avenue office. Alan went there that morning and noticed that everything
                            was perfectly in place. He felt relieved because he usually had to fix
                            the layout of the office. After Alan viewed the office at Madison
                            Avenue, he took the M-train to the main office which was at the World
                            Trade. However, on his way to the office the M-train had stopped at
                            Cortland Street for a very long time. Alan had to be re-directed to
                            Rector Street. The reason for the re-direction was due to a smoke
                            condition. At first, Alan didn’t think too much about being re-directed
                            because it did happen before. On the other hand, once Alan got off the
                            train at Rector Street he saw people running, papers blowing everywhere
                            and saw smoke in the air. Alan noticed a bunch of firemen standing
                            around and approached them in order to find out answers. The firemen
                            believed that a small plane had crashed into the tower. However, as Alan
                            was standing around he and the firemen had heard the second plane’s
                            engine rumbling. Alan saw the second plane go right into the tower. When
                            Alan saw the second plane hit he asked the firemen to help him search
                            for anyone who was at the building where he had worked. Alan was a Fire
                            Warden and believed it was his duty to help rescue people from building
                            five. He and the firefighters started walking towards Alan’s office. As
                            Alan was walking he noticed the destruction, the debris and the amount
                            of body parts that consumed the area around the World Trade. Alan
                            witnessed the debris and people falling from the towers. He went into
                            building five and saw a jet engine in the cafeteria of the building.
                            Alan searched all nine floors of the building to find anyone who was in
                            distress. Alan left the building and noticed that people were going into
                            nearby stores to consume necessities that were needed to help the
                            wounded. He and a bunch of firemen opened up a cooler at one of the
                            street kiosks located near the sight. Alan helped handout juice and
                            soda. He noticed that people were covered in jet fuel. Alan was about to
                            leave until one of the towers came down. There was a loud rumble and
                            huge gust of wind from the collapsing tower. Alan hid underneath an
                            ambulance. No one believed that the towers were going to fall down.
                            There was a huge dust cloud that consumed the area around the World
                            Trade. Alan got knocked out by the falling debris and later woke up
                            inside of the same ambulance that he was hiding underneath. Alan had a
                            hard time breathing and was covered head to toe in a thick layer of dust
                            and dirt. Alan described the World Trade site as a warzone. Everything
                            was in black and white due to the dust and the towers falling. Alan left
                            the chaotic scene and was trying to make his way back to the Madison
                            Avenue office. On his way to the office, Alan sat down on a curb and
                            broke down crying. A woman approached Alan and invited him into her
                            apartment in order for him to clean up. When he got to the woman’s
                            apartment the phone lines were down and the television was on showing
                            the event that had just occurred at the World Trade. Alan left the
                            woman’s apartment and made it to the Madison office where he was greeted
                            by his fellow workers and was sent to the medical center in the
                            building. Here, Alan received new clothes and started making plans to go
                            home. Alan doesn’t remember how he made it back home. However, Alan
                            distinctively remembers that people were eating meals at cafes and
                            enjoying life while the towers were collapsing. Later that night, Alan’s
                            community got together and said prayers for the victims. Alan had to
                            start back at work right away because it was his job to make sure people
                            had a place for them to work. The railroads were up and running. Alan
                            was shocked about the amount of people who had returned to work the next
                            day. However, some workers never showed up at their jobs ever again and
                            Alan noticed that everyone had this looming atmosphere over their heads
                            while they were working. When Alan returned home to his family his
                            daughter had trouble coping with the 9/11 events. Alan’s daughter
                            realized that she almost lost her father which resulted in her having
                            difficulties sleeping. Alan went back to the site a couple of weeks
                            later and the site still had a stench in the air. The events of 9/11 has
                            made Alan become more aware of his surroundings. He keeps a watchful
                            eye-out for anything that may seem suspicious. In addition, Alan
                            mentioned that there was a huge shift in the mentality of New Yorkers
                            after 9/11. People became more forgiving of one another after the
                            event.

       Tim worked as a Captain for the NYPD on September 11, 2011. Tim described
                            that day as a “beautiful clear day”. On the morning of 9/11 Tim was
                            finishing up his 7am shift by going over assignments with his officers,
                            and started his drive home from Queens to Ronkonkoma. As Tim started his
                            drive to Ronkonkoma, where he had lived since 1983, he heard on the
                            radio that a plane had crashed. Tim, who came from a large civil servant
                            family, continued his drive and turned on the TV when he got home. It
                            was at that point he saw the first building had fallen. Without
                            hesitation, Tim changed into his uniform, and started his journey back
                            to the city. Tim’s sister called him to make sure he was ok. This was
                            the only family member of 7 that he would speak to that morning to relay
                            that he was safe. Tim described the drive back as “surreal” and reported
                            to the Brooklyn Navy Yard which had been established at the muster
                            station. It was there that Tim used his years of experience and
                            management skills to direct his fellow officers, even though “it was
                            very confusing, what they wanted us to do”. Earlier that day, Tim had
                            assigned members of his squad down to Battery Park. It would be 2 days
                            before Tim would know if they were safe or not. That stress weighed on
                            him heavily, as he felt as though he had directed them to an area that
                            would later become so dangerous. As Tim and his officers waiting for
                            directions, the amount of frustration continued to build as they waited.
                            “You could smell it, you could see it, but there was nothing you could
                            do”. It wouldn’t be until 3am the next day, after not sleeping for 24-36
                            hours, that Tim would finally view the devastation first hand. On 9/12,
                            Tim, along with other member of his team were able to get down to Ground
                            Zero. Tim clearly remembers the setting as it was “hazy” and that he
                            could “taste the lime from the concrete dust”. Tim remembers that the
                            “only thing to survive the fall was paper”. Tim kept looking for a
                            command center, a way to “find a purpose” but at that time he was unable
                            to, so he returned to his office. “I didn’t take the time to think about
                            the other aspects. We were hopeful for people that could be helped. We
                            didn’t want to think about it for what it was”. As the days went on, Tim
                            helped in all the ways that he could. During the day he would help
                            organize and direct his officers. He would attend funerals and check in
                            with his fellow officers at the West Side Pier and other locations to
                            see if he could help. At night he would dedicate himself to the bucket
                            brigade. Joining the line, regardless of his ranking, to help move the
                            debris. Although they were given masks, gloves and flashlights, Tim
                            explained that even with the mask they never had “full protection”. Tim
                            stated that it was necessary to remove the mask to rest, eat, and drink
                            thus exposing him to the toxic air. When asked why Time worked so
                            tirelessly, day and night he responded by explaining how “it’s who I am,
                            and how I was raised.” As early 2002 approached, Tim stopped going down
                            to the site. At that point he had lost many people close to him,
                            including two friends that had died, and would later lose a close friend
                            and colleague, Eddie. Although Tim had just made 20 years in the NYPD,
                            after 9/11 he explained how he wasn’t able to retire. He felt as though
                            “There is a bond among the people who were there” and that “police have
                            a fraternal link”. He was so impressed and “proud of the city” and he
                            just wasn’t ready to leave. Tim now works as a Deputy Investigator with
                            the Emergency Planning division. He feels as though he has found his
                            niche and that he is inspired by the “big changes in how people
                            perceived us”. Tim hopes that in the future the people who responded are
                            remembered. Tim does not perceive himself as a hero. He “did it because
                            it was the right thing to do” and I’d do it again”. “A lot of good
                            people did it because it was the right thing to do. If it happens again,
                            I hope you run south”

       Teresa was born in the Bronx, New York to an Irish Catholic family. There
                            are four boys and four girls in her family, and they grew up a
                            neighborhood in Rockland County that was full of other Bronx families.
                            On September 11th Teresa was supposed to be in lower Manhattan for
                            Domestic Liaison Training, but it had been cancelled so she was in route
                            to work in Orangeburg (Rockland County, NY). Dribs and drabs of the
                            story were on the radio. She works as part of a Rescue and Disaster
                            Relief program, and they thought there would be a lot of people who
                            needed help medically – not critical or life threatening, but they
                            formed a plan where victims with minor wounds could come to Orangeburg
                            on the train. As it turned out, there was no need for this service, so
                            the space was used to house students and people who were stranded in
                            Rockland County and couldn’t get home to the city. It was a very high
                            stress, tense scenario. There was a lot of disbelief, and Teresa had a
                            “quiet, panicky feeling” - everyone was worrying about people they knew,
                            was everyone all right; a co-worker’s wife was a New York City Police
                            Officer, and this heightened the anxiety for everyone. Teresa had been
                            listening to the news all day at work, but had not seen any images of
                            the site until she got home. She states that in times of stress she
                            shuts down – she suffers from PTSD due to an unrelated childhood
                            incident; “It’s a blessing or a curse” in that it allows her to shut
                            down and focus on what needs to be done. She was asked by a friend to
                            help serve food on Westside Canal (she is uncertain of the location) –
                            Teresa states that she tried to recollect events chronologically the day
                            before this interview, but it’s like “going down the rabbit hole”. She
                            worked at a water station on Murphy Street because no one was permitted
                            in lower Manhattan unless they had clearance. She also went to a bakery
                            to help prepare food, and eventually went to the Salvation Army in late
                            September to get identification. Because of her background in social
                            services, she was called to help with benefits eligibility and
                            determination. She states it’s a curse to be in government eligibility –
                            because of her regular work, she asked too many questions of those
                            seeking benefits; “not a good trait in a volunteer!” She helped in this
                            capacity for three weeks, but wanted to be doing more physical help; she
                            wanted to be around “the guys” (the first responders) to get more of a
                            feeling of accomplishment. While helping with the Salvation Army, she
                            saw workers coming in to get water or soda, for respite, food or a
                            massage; there were ministers and counselors there too but her
                            assignment was to keep the coolers filled with liquids. OSHA came in and
                            said to keep the dust out of the coolers and this kept the volunteers
                            busy. When asked how she was feeling at this time, Teresa responded that
                            so much was really intense, “if you can call intense a feeling – it’s
                            hokey but it was like we were all in it together.” There was a great
                            feeling of camaraderie. It was so weird to drive on the roads when no
                            one was there but the soldiers. She recalls one day coming over the
                            bridge and being surprised that the soldiers were gone - “Oh no, where
                            are they? I got used to them being there.” She remembers being told the
                            air quality was fine, but her son is an engineer and so for Christmas
                            the kids gave her a self-contained respirator mask. It had not occurred
                            to her – the whole city smelled like fire, but she never really
                            considered the dust and toxins in the air. Teresa laughs, and says she
                            feels like the non-smokers got sicker than the smokers, because they
                            already breathe better. The masks were obstructive, so even those who
                            had them never really wore them. Teresa stayed on as a volunteer until
                            May when she stated that weird things began to go on and she knew it was
                            time to end her service there. People were arguing about weird things,
                            wanting to know where the volunteers were at all times, kind of driving
                            them out. She felt it was a ‘sign’ that it was the end. There were odd
                            power struggles, and she thought she was losing the purpose of being
                            there. She “kind of faded out of it”. Before she left, she rode the
                            Gator down into the site, but she saw the whole pit as “a construction
                            site” but with a solemn feel. “I’m really good at shutting off and I’m
                            sure that’s what I did…” – she didn’t think about the specifics of what
                            was going on. Things bothered her more when she was out of the site
                            because she would be less guarded, less “turned off”. Seeing an
                            ambulance mad her cry in the street; sirens would produce a panic, but
                            the closer to Ground Zero she got the calmer she felt. She would fall
                            into her role: to help – she would wake up at night weeping, but when
                            she was at the site she was ok. Teresa now has breathing issues and has
                            been diagnosed with COPD. This gets worse when she is upset, so “you can
                            be calm or you can’t breathe”. She has groups of friends she talks to
                            and a spiritual practice to be self-aware. She didn’t deliberately not
                            talk about it at home, but she had a network of supportive people. She
                            states, you can imagine but can’t imagine it. Just thinking that all
                            those people would be found, and were not – people were shell-shocked.
                            There was a lot of ‘non-work’ going on at work, everyone talking about
                            the event. She didn’t stay home and speculate, she got right in and got
                            involved. Teresa has no regrets that she did this work despite her
                            health issues. She hopes it never happens again, but it did make new
                            Yorkers appreciate each other. “Terrible event, but so many positive
                            things happened – people coming together in a crisis.”

       Nadia had been working in the New York tourism industry for six years
                            when the 9/11 attacks occurred. Throughout her career as a tour guide,
                            she spent a lot of time exploring Lower Manhattan, coming to thoroughly
                            know all of its ins and outs. On 9/11, she was the tour manager for New
                            York Waterways. She was off that day, but when she saw on the news that
                            planes had crashed into the World Trade Center, she immediately went to
                            work to help however she could. As she was driving toward Manhattan on
                            the New Jersey Turnpike, she could see the smoke from the burning
                            towers. When she arrived at the World Financial Center to rendezvous
                            with the boats, the first tower had already fallen. She recalls a
                            “surreal” atmosphere of “doom” at that moment, “like an action movie.”
                            She got on one of the boats and moved to midtown; while she was on the
                            water, the second tower fell. At that time, throughout the rest of that
                            day, and for the majority of the next nine months, Nadia recalls feeling
                            very little grief, just a drive to keep doing whatever she could to
                            help. Her job that day was to help evacuate Manhattan by boat. She
                            recalls thousands of people lined up from 38th St. to 42nd St. waiting
                            to go home. She was there until 1 am that day helping people to get
                            home; in the ensuing months, ferries transported about 54,000 people per
                            day, double their usual capacity. The next day, Nadia worked at the
                            World Financial Center to give food to first responders working the
                            site. That night, she walked Ground Zero; even today, she struggles to
                            find words to adequately describe her overwhelming feelings. For the
                            next three months, she worked at the Wall Street port coordinating the
                            commuter ferries, and would see the pile more than once a week. During
                            this time, she became friendly with many of the recovery workers, even
                            meeting her husband on September 21. She continued coordinating commuter
                            ferries until May 2002, although she relocated to the Battery after
                            three months at Wall Street. After those nine months, she was removed
                            from that job and was diagnosed with PTSD from the events. Nadia
                            underwent six months of therapy for this, which was the first time she
                            had discussed what she had seen and experienced. She recalls it being
                            easier to talk about her experiences then than it is today; after her
                            therapy, she says she “detached herself” from those memories. While she
                            was coordinating the ferries, Nadia preferred to listen to the radio
                            than to watch TV, because she didn’t want to see the imagery of planes
                            crashing into the towers and the towers collapsing. Even today, she
                            almost never watches any 9/11 media; when she sees the planes hitting
                            the building, she can still smell the burning bodies from the pile.
                            Nadia feels she has changed very much as a result of the 9/11 attacks.
                            Whenever she is in a public place, she feels that she can’t relax;
                            instead, she is constantly vigilant so she can protect her family if she
                            must. She also feels that the attacks and the days following them were
                            her first experiences with hatred, which she now sees all around the
                            world. She hopes that, someday, people will take the following as a
                            lesson from 9/11: that anyone who seeks justice and freedom can do so
                            with love and words, not hatred and violence.

       Born in Jamaica, Queens, Bob moved to Wyandanch with his family at 3
                            years of age. In 1948 his dad became a volunteer fire fighter, and in
                            1963 they moved to Saint James. In 1968, his father joined the Saint
                            James Volunteer Fire Department. Currently Bob lives and volunteers in
                            Selden NY. His service record spans 25 years as an EMT, he is an
                            ex-Captain, was the Commissioner of the Selden Fire Department in 2009,
                            and is the Vice President of the Fireman’s Association in the State of
                            New York. But Bob states that his greatest accomplishment is that he is
                            currently the President of the Suffolk County Emerald Society. He has
                            responded to the wildfires on Long Island in 1995, and in 1996 to the
                            crash of flight 800 on Long Island. Bob has always been community
                            oriented and the fire department is a focal point of the community. “I
                            don’t have a hobby; I don’t play golf – my hobby is the fire
                            department.” Bob has been a civilian employee in the Suffolk County
                            Quartermaster’s office in Yaphank, NY for 20 years. On September 11th,
                            Bob had taken a vacation day to get some things done, and went to the
                            fire department for morning coffee and to listen to [the radio show]
                            Imus in the Morning. It was then that he heard a plane had crashed into
                            the towers, and they turned on the television. “We thought it was kind
                            of an accident” but when the second plane hit they knew it was more than
                            that. They checked on fellow firefighters who worked in Manhattan, and
                            one, Nick, was on duty in lower Manhattan. They began to make plans, not
                            knowing if they would be asked to respond. ‘Attacks’ were not a normal
                            part of conversation, “back then we just didn’t think like that.” As the
                            day progressed, more guys came in – glued to the television, some just
                            watching, some getting ready. They got the heavy rescue truck ready. By
                            late afternoon, Suffolk County had started getting organized. Bob drove
                            the truck; at 54 years of age he was considered an exterior firefighter.
                            They packed a bag – Bob, the Captain, and 6 guys – got some water and
                            went to Yaphank with 20 other engines to travel together to Manhattan.
                            There was a convoy of trucks driving down the Long Island Expressway;
                            there was no other traffic. They were diverted to Brooklyn to fill in
                            for houses who had already responded. They didn’t really have a true
                            conception of what was going on, “we were responding like it was a
                            ‘normal’ call”. Another wave of trucks came in, so they left Brooklyn to
                            go to Ground Zero. There was very little communication coming out of the
                            site – “we didn’t have cell phones like we do now, we just did our job:
                            to respond.” There was devastation as far as you could see – there were
                            no visible street signs and they weren’t really sure where they were.
                            They were instructed to go “two lefts and a right, and park on the
                            corner.” They just “kinda sat in the truck, surrounded by 12 inches of
                            dust” and they didn’t really want to get out of the truck. The guys they
                            could see all looked like Pigpen [from Charlie Brown] with puffs of dirt
                            and dust billowing up when they walked. They became concerned how they
                            were going to stay clean and safe. Bob watched the men pick up the
                            debris and disturb the dust, creating huge clouds of dust, and this
                            scenario kept repeating. While he was alone watching the truck, Bob
                            gathered food for the responders and kept the truck clean so the men
                            would have a clean place to eat and rest. The guys would come back from
                            the pile “kind of in shock, young guys [in their] late 20’s and early
                            30’s, all a little disoriented and shocked.” They would go out, come
                            back to eat and rest, and this went on for about 18 hours that first
                            night. It “became a pretty well organized situation” but Bob kept his
                            eye on Building 7 because if it came down it would have hit the truck.
                            Every time they surveyed, if the building moved they would blow a siren
                            and everyone would run away from the site. He thought he would get
                            trampled, so when he heard the siren he would climb up and sit on the
                            roof of the truck. A major concern was to get power so that the
                            responders could speak to family; “They needed to know it was possible
                            even if they couldn’t actually call.” Around Wednesday or Thursday
                            trucks came with generators to provide lights and power. The lights were
                            needed to secure the site but there were not enough resources to do so –
                            Bob states that many mutual aid rules and regulations were changed for
                            9/11. Nick, his fellow volunteer firefighter who was on duty that day,
                            never came home. It isn’t clear what exactly happened to him. The guys
                            from the Selden FD looked for Nick, “dug, looked, dug – if we had let
                            them, the guys would still be digging.” Three or four months later they
                            had a memorial and named a street after him. Nick’s gear is on display
                            in Selden and the clock is stopped at the time the towers fell. “It was
                            a saving grace that he died on FDNY’s watch and not on our watch – seems
                            like it was meant to be – nothing we did wrong or anything we could have
                            done.” Bob states that this kind of thing happens, and you just have to
                            accept it and move on. After the initial 18 hours at the site they drove
                            home to Selden, cleaned the truck, and threw out 8 sets of turn-out gear
                            since they were unsure what they might be contaminated with. All the
                            guys ate together and “kind of talked about it.” Suffolk County let him
                            have some time off and he dreaded going back to work; he didn’t want to
                            face a million questions. Bob recalls he considered just making a sign
                            and telling everyone to just read the sign – but since he worked for the
                            SCPD, they “were pretty good, didn’t ask too many questions.” They
                            responded for 3 or 4 more weeks, and Bob says he hates to say it but it
                            was great training for responding to Hurricane Sandy. “We learned a lot
                            about coordination, put us ahead of the curve for future disasters.” Bob
                            recalls that he was “just not really ready to see what I saw, still
                            don’t believe sometimes that I saw it”, that it’s something that you’d
                            never forget. On top of thousands of responses as a volunteer, “the
                            immensity of it is overwhelming sometimes” but they have to go on.
                            “There is still the community and citizens of Selden to serve and
                            protect”. It’s not something he likes to reflect on; many people don’t
                            even know he was there. “Just trying to help and be part of the
                            solution.”

       David Sharinn is a retired electrician and was working as an electrician
                            on 9/11/2001. David was raised in Brooklyn, but resided in Suffolk
                            County on the day of the attacks. He lived at home with his wife, and
                            had two grown children and two grandchildren at that time. David was
                            working on the 50th floor on 140 Broadway and his wife had called him to
                            tell him a plane crashed into the tower. Being on the 50th floor, he had
                            the view of the city, so he went to look out the window and he saw the
                            second plane hit the building. He and his coworkers “ran like hell”.
                            They headed for the 59th Street Bridge and crossed over to Queens.
                            Everyone was covered in white dust. “Everyone was holding onto someone”
                            to console and support each other. David returned to work about one week
                            later, and lower Manhattan looked like a war zone. Restaurants were
                            gone. Everything was abandoned. He felt great animosity towards the
                            terrorists. His first jobs were to restore power to the schools in the
                            area, so he rewired the buildings and installed new electrical poles. He
                            would commute on the LIRR then subway until the last stop available, and
                            then walk the rest of the way downtown. On his commute home, fellow
                            commuters would discuss their 9/11 events. This allowed him to
                            decompress by the time he got home. David retired in January 2003. The
                            events of 9/11 have made David appreciate life more. He feels life is
                            too short so you should do what you want to do: go fishing, go on
                            vacation, etc. He still gets goose bumps when talking of his memories,
                            and vividly remembers “the Jumpers”. He has coughing and breathing
                            problems and wishes the authorities were more forthcoming with the truth
                            about the air quality, but “you do what you gotta do”. He does not
                            consider himself a hero because he ran away while NYPD and FDNY ran
                            towards the danger. He hasn’t visited the memorial yet, but is glad that
                            it was built so that no one forgets.

       Hal grew up in the South Bronx and is from a middle class background.
                            After graduating high school in 1979, he attended John Jay College for 2
                            ½ years and then joined NYPD. He did go back to John Jay and took 7 ½
                            years to complete his Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. On September
                            10th, Hal had worked his normal shift of noon to 6am. At 9:14am
                            September 11th, he was woken by a phone call: had he seen the towers? He
                            immediately packed a duffel bag with clothing and toiletries. He left a
                            note for his wife, who was seven months pregnant, “Going to the towers,
                            love you, bye”. He says his wife was kind of “on auto pilot” – she knew
                            it wasn’t going to be a picnic but “she’s a cop’s wife and knows it’s
                            not 9-5.” As a crime scene detective, he knew his role would be to find
                            and recover human remains. Driving in, all the cars were firefighters
                            and police officers with their shields displayed in their windshields –
                            all of them zig-zagging and driving like lunatics to get into the city.
                            He got in to work at 9:59 as the tower was collapsing, and there was “a
                            lot of waiting around to go in”. It was frustrating to have to wait, “we
                            were trained for this, we wanted to go!” but some colleagues who had
                            gone in early were caught in the collapse; thankfully they all survived.
                            He ended up going to the site on September 12th. They bulked up on
                            gloves, lights, film, cameras, personal protective gear – everything we
                            would need to preserve a crime scene. “The masks that we had were not
                            the right ones.” They drove the van to central command – this crime
                            scene was blocks and blocks; where do you start? It was surreal – smell
                            of smoke, construction material, looked like the moon landscape. There
                            were no computers, couches or doors [in the debris] – there was just
                            lots of rebar, rubble, chunks of concrete and airplane [parts].
                            Chalkboards and magnetic boards were set up; from the beginning they
                            were making sure a strong foundation was built to have a successful
                            investigation. They did a walk-through to get an idea of the area. They
                            had photographs and blueprints and formed a grid search, looking in
                            quadrants. The grid was in the pit and Hal was there for about 7 weeks,
                            climbing in and under the debris and in garages. In the beginning they
                            were hopeful they would find people, but it was sad and disappointing.
                            Hal was not thinking about the totality of the situation, he was just
                            focusing on his job. At one point there was a commotion, and he went
                            over to either document it or be of assistance: there was a hand and it
                            was waving. “Wow – it was someone alive, maybe injured!” All equipment
                            was shut down to be able to hear a voice; everyone was coming and the
                            hand was waving even more - it was such an adrenaline rush. But it was
                            just an arm affixed to the girder, and every time they stepped on the
                            girder the hand would move. It was painful, devastating, frustrating;
                            the wind was knocked out of their sails. Hal states that there was not a
                            lot of chatting about the job; there were lots of clergy to speak to –
                            no shortage of ministers, rabbis, imams – there was a lot of interaction
                            with them. “I thought they needed my more then I needed their help. I
                            was ok, not to sound like a horrible person” but it “took all sorts of
                            people to get the job done.” It was different at home. Hal’s wife was
                            very supportive, she was available if he wanted to talk. His son was 2 ½
                            years old when he finally had a day off, and he approached his son to
                            say “Hey buddy, how’s it going, how ya doing” and his son put up his
                            hand and said “Daddy lives at work.” Hal attended the museum opening.
                            “Didn’t want to go, the wife and kids wanted to go. I didn’t want to go.
                            Did I mention I didn’t want to go?” But he says it was tastefully done,
                            there was “no big Oh My God moment”. But “I was there: I lived, worked
                            and ate there, breathed in people parts, computer parts” but he feels
                            the museum was a true representation. After his 7 week stint at the
                            site, Hal was transferred to the Bio Terrorism unit for the anthrax
                            investigation. He thought between the Trade Center and the anthrax, it
                            was the end of the world as he knew it. He says you have to isolate and
                            compartmentalize yourself, you can’t “act like a sad sack all the time.
                            I’ve worked over 1700 homicides, if I cried for every dead body my eyes
                            would be as big as your fists.” Hal states that you can’t save
                            everybody; there’s work time, home time and play time. You can fool
                            yourself into thinking you can handle it. He has “some bad thoughts,
                            some demons”: he went on the rooftops nearby to look for evidence. There
                            was a lot of debris, and he tripped; he looked down and it was the right
                            arm of a little girl, “I could tell from the size” – he picked her up
                            and saw nail polish, “maybe she was a passenger, maybe on vacation”. He
                            wrapped up the arm and cradled it, wouldn’t give it to anyone else.
                            “This [memory] stays with me.” He does not, even to this day, speak to
                            his family about it; he tells them to watch PBS or go to the museum. He
                            retired in April of 2002 after 20 years of service. “Game plan was
                            pretty much always to do 20; it gets depressing after a while, all these
                            dead people.” Hal states that in the 1990’s he had worked 6 murders a
                            day – it was “time to flip the page and go to the next chapter.” If this
                            happened again, Hal would do the same exact thing. He might do things a
                            little differently, but he’d still do his “super small part” – but would
                            have taken more precautions, health-wise. “All the dust contained
                            silica, computer parts, asbestos.” He would have instilled upon people
                            to take care of themselves.

       Mark’s dad and two uncles were police officers, so it kind of ran in the
                            family. He has been married for 26 years and has two children; he lives
                            in Bellport NY and loves the beach and hockey. He retired from the NYPD
                            in 2004 and currently works in fashion photography which takes him all
                            over the world. On September 11th, Mark was working in Manhattan South.
                            He came in at 5:00am for Primary Day and was at a 9:00 meeting at
                            headquarters when they heard the tower had been hit. They went to the
                            towers but were on the opposite side so he didn’t see the impact of the
                            second plane, but heard the explosion. They tried to set up a command
                            center but it was too chaotic. The initial call was that a helicopter
                            had hit the tower but once they were there it was apparent that this
                            information was incorrect. It was so much worse than they believed – he
                            saw a woman’s shoe, a tire from one of the planes, jumpers. Things were
                            crazy. Mark recalls seeing the Emergency Services guys suiting up –
                            “It’s eerie to think of those guys now.” The extent of the damage was
                            shocking . They went to a conference room in the American Express
                            building to set up and try to figure out what to do next. A woman ran in
                            and said to get out because the south tower was falling (right across
                            the street). They ran out, but it was as dark as night; he couldn’t see
                            anything but though he was running toward the river. He ended up about
                            five blocks away in Stuyvesant High School when the North tower fell. It
                            was hours before they could step outside and see anything; the school
                            had dust and debris but you could function. To this day he has no idea
                            where it came from, but he had a wet cloth for his face. A temporary
                            morgue was set up in the American Express building. Anything found in
                            the search and recovery had to be logged in, and all the cops came there
                            to check in and get an assignment. Inventory was taken - bodies, body
                            parts, plane pieces, guns, gold, money from 7 WTC – and it was noted if
                            police, fire or ironworks found the item. “Seeing pieces of the plane –
                            thinking of those poor people, they took off and should have landed.”
                            Mark believes the whole mentality of the world changed after 9/11. Empty
                            suitcases, abandoned packages - before 9/11 this was no big deal, but
                            not anymore. He says that 9/11 has affected him but he doesn’t dwell on
                            it and doesn’t let it hold him back. He watches the news, “I can’t feel
                            bad for people getting water boarded – what about all those moms and
                            dads who jumped? You can’t make me feel bad.” He’s turned into an “eye
                            for an eye, tooth for a tooth kind of guy. How many kids grew up without
                            a parent – because why, they went into work that morning? It makes me
                            mad, that’s how it affects me.” To future generations, Mark would say –
                            when something like 9/11 happens, the people will come together and do
                            anything for anyone; so many people came to help, even to just hand out
                            a bottle of water. People should know: there are people out there who
                            have your back when they don’t have to, not to be a hero but just to
                            help.

       Kevin was a Detective Squad Supervisor with the NYPD on 9/11/2001,
                            although he was not at work when the planes hit the towers. In fact, he
                            was asleep when the first plane hit; the first thing he saw of the
                            attacks was a shot of the first tower on fire on TV. He was watching
                            when the second plane hit, and it was at that moment the he knew the
                            city was under attack. Kevin, also a volunteer firefighter in Smithtown,
                            went to prepare his firehouse before driving into Queens. He was at the
                            precinct for three days straight, until Thursday evening, trying to keep
                            it going during the crisis. In the days following the attacks, NYPD
                            detectives were expected to run down every tip and lead related to the
                            attacks, no matter how ridiculous they seemed. In addition to this
                            responsibility, the detectives were also considered a “mobile force” to
                            be deployed if something else were to happen at this time. On Thursday
                            evening, when he was finally told to go home, Kevin and a few of his
                            colleagues went to Ground Zero with the intention of helping. He says
                            the scene was “mayhem” where everyone had a job to do. They couldn’t
                            find much to do except take in the “surreal” sights of the night, and
                            they left without doing much. The next day, the recovery efforts fully
                            began: detectives were dispatched to Fresh Kills Landfill, as well as
                            morgues and the Ground Zero site, to salvage whatever they could and
                            close as many missing persons cases as possible. Kevin went to the
                            landfill, where he remained until April 2002. He says this experience is
                            filled with lots of bad memories, and to this day he avoids driving on
                            Route 440 as a result. He recalls the sight of job-hardened detectives –
                            men and women who had “seen it all” – crying and digging through piles
                            of debris with their bare hands trying to find anything they could on
                            the first day of the job. Because he was a supervising Sergeant at the
                            time, Kevin dealt with many behind-the-scenes aspects of the recovery
                            effort that most officers didn’t see. He recalls butting heads with
                            several FBI agents who were running the recovery effort at Fresh Kills,
                            but also speaks highly of the agents who joined him and his men on the
                            job. He also recalls driving all over Queens to find dual-canister
                            respirators to outfit his men with, because he believed the paper masks
                            that they were provided with to be inadequate. Kevin says the full
                            magnitude of the disaster didn’t hit him until about a week of working
                            at the landfill, when he realized that the amount of debris he and his
                            colleagues were combing through was “staggering” and overwhelming. He
                            continued to do this work until April 2002, when the landfill was
                            finally shut down to recovery efforts. He retired in December of that
                            same year – not as a result of his time in the recovery efforts, he says
                            – and currently works as a registered nurse at a local hospital. Kevin
                            does not like to see or read anything about the 9/11 attacks, and has no
                            interest in seeing the memorial. He also doesn’t like going into the
                            city anymore because he doesn’t like the crowds. He says he still goes
                            to funerals for men and women who died either during the recovery or as
                            a result of their participation in it. For him, the lesson that needs to
                            be taken from the 9/11 attacks is that law enforcement agencies need to
                            talk to each other; they had all the pieces that were needed to prevent
                            this tragedy, they just couldn’t put them together. He also strongly
                            believes that we as a country need to be able to protect ourselves, and
                            hopes that people never lose sight of that fact.

       John grew up in Astoria, Queens and there were two things he always
                            wanted to be: a cop, or an actor. He took every civil service test he
                            could until he got called by NYPD – growing up with [TV shows] Starsky
                            and Hutch and Baretta; he always wanted to help. His brother was also a
                            cop and he enjoyed it; plus there were perks: young retirement, the
                            salary would be comfortable and he could make a career of it. On
                            September 11th, John was in the office and the phone started ringing –
                            the staff Sargent said a Cesena had crashed into the tower. His unit
                            would set up road blocks, keep civilians out, etc., so they geared up to
                            go. Traveling south, they could see the smoke. His partner, Kramer,
                            heard a jet fly by and within moments they heard the second tower had
                            been hit. Everyone was awestruck – concerned but not afraid yet, just
                            thinking about a game plan, where to meet their commanding officer. They
                            were going into “training mode” – get a plan in place and move forward.
                            It was organized chaos. Kramer was EMS before he came to the police
                            department, and that training was kicking in – he felt the ambulance
                            triage was too close to the buildings and told the commanding officer.
                            They were told to go to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel to create a free
                            flowing traffic pattern. They were looking up, and something impacted
                            the top of the truck – he saw what appeared to be intestine and said,
                            “We gotta get out of here.” The towers were still standing and there was
                            a lot of radio chatter and civilians standing around. A civilian asked
                            him if they could use a bus to transport all the bystanders out of the
                            area, and John replied, “All due respect sir, you have legs – use them –
                            you choose to be here.” Then they heard a cracking sound and the top of
                            the south tower started to go over. There was a sea of humanity running
                            toward him, he was yelling “Run, run!” and the tower “just imploded”.
                            There was a huge wall of debris and smoke rolling like the sea, coming
                            straight towards him. He had an epiphany - why am I standing here?! He
                            lost track of Kramer and a cloud pushed him over – it was pitch black,
                            thick smoke, he couldn’t see or breathe. John pulled his shirt up over
                            his face and tried to take shallow breaths. He began walking south and
                            hit a chain link fence, then walked east. It was like a snowfall – calm
                            and quiet, but not white: it was brown. His radio was silent, and he was
                            thinking the worst. He got to a building and tried to administer first
                            aid; he and a security guard found the bathrooms and people washed and
                            got a drink. Everyone was pretty much ok, just very afraid. Radio
                            chatter started back up and he wanted to find his partner. He went back
                            out and there was still thick clouds of smoke; he heard another cracking
                            sound and the thunder of the building – he stopped, turned around, and
                            just as he got back inside the building he had just left, the second
                            tower fell. “Oh my goodness, BOTH towers.” John told the other people in
                            the building to stay there, and tried to leave again. He went towards
                            what would be known as the pile. He could hear familiar voices from his
                            unit on the radio, and he started to make his way towards them. They
                            were told to regroup at Battery Park for a head count and to re-post
                            wherever they were needed. One Sargent was missing and they tried to
                            figure out who had seen him last. It was hard to keep a head count; cops
                            on duty and of duty were coming in. EMS gave them oxygen and water.
                            About 6 hours later, the evening shift was coming in “all clean” and the
                            second in command wanted them to all go back, but the CO said no, the
                            fresh personnel would take over their positions. He finally found his
                            partner Kramer, and said [laughing], “What the hell, you left me!” He
                            was able to call his wife but service was bad; Kramer finally got
                            through and his wife Lisa thought the worst [hearing Kramer’s voice
                            instead of John’s] but Kramer said, “Oh your idiot husband just doesn’t
                            know how to use my phone.” At 11:00pm, he asked if he could go home – he
                            could, but had to be back by 4:00am. He showered, changed his uniform
                            and reported right back. His unit was back-up for search and rescue;
                            they still hadn’t found their missing Sargent, Timothy Roy. He was
                            trying to make sense of it all. The burning [fires], acrid smell – “this
                            can’t be good, but we had a job to do.” John was there every day for two
                            months. On Saint Patrick’s Day, they found Sgt. Roy’s body. Another
                            officer from his unit had been at One Police Plaza putting in his
                            retirement papers on 9/11; he responded to the towers and perished
                            there. John recalls Christine Whitman of the EPA stating that the air
                            quality was fine: “Oh right, it’s all about the money, get Wall Street
                            back up and running.” He was able to get one box (a dozen) good masks –
                            “What gives?! Give us two boxes!” But “the higher ups said NO.” They
                            would try to take care of the guys on foot patrol, getting them
                            protective eyewear. Early November, John was coughing, “coughing and
                            spitting up God knows what” and he went to see a pulmonologist. He took
                            a couple of days off sick, but “I’m not a banker, this is what I do.” By
                            2012 John diagnosed with sludge in his gallbladder, and had an enlarged
                            spleen. He was referred to a hematologist and on April 1st, “April
                            Fool’s Day, of all days!” he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
                            “My daughters are still young, what the hell?!” And so began his 10 year
                            odyssey of chemotherapy and treatment. When the chemo stopped working,
                            he did stem cell transplants. He says he gets emotional sometimes,
                            driving back and forth to Slone Kettering [hospital]. John has mixed
                            feelings about the new tower. “There’s still people there that weren’t
                            recovered. It doesn’t sit well with me.”

       On September 11, 2001, John Farrell was the Security Manager for the
                            Deutsche Bank on 130 Liberty Avenue, adjacent to the World Trade Center.
                            He was a retired NYPD and then worked in this position since 1997. He
                            was divorced, and living alone in Bethpage, LI. He commuted daily on the
                            LIRR, and that day began like every other, arriving at work at 8am. The
                            main lobby of the Deutsche Bank Building had the normal hustle and
                            bustle. He was with his partner and they were both greeting the other
                            personnel and talking to their coworkers when they heard a loud cracking
                            noise. Through the lobby windows they saw people running through the
                            street. A woman came into the building bleeding. John went outside to
                            try to figure out what the commotion was. He saw debris flying around,
                            and saw smoke. He also saw tons of paper flying around everywhere. He
                            saw a piece of engine on the street. Seeing the large engine, he then
                            knew a jet had crashed into the tower. He saw various body parts land on
                            the street and they were still steaming. Within 10-15 minutes John heard
                            the emergency vehicles driving by. John and his partner began to seal
                            off the area and began to evacuate the building on the rear of the
                            building. The smoke had increased so much that they could not see above
                            them. The streets were now a foot deep in debris. Cars were on fire.
                            FDNY began to use their lobby entrance for command post. Then John heard
                            the roaring sound of a speeding locomotive, and the ground was shaking,
                            the plate glass windows were breaking and John held onto a column that
                            was a support beam. A piece of the WTC fell on the lobby and everything
                            went black. He could not see anything in front of him and even when he
                            worked his way to an exit, even outside was black. In broad daylight, it
                            was total darkness. He was much disoriented but he continued to lead
                            people outside the building. They were all are frozen in terror because
                            they still didn’t know what was going on. Once he finally felt normal,
                            the second tower collapsed. John was one of the “Dust People” who walked
                            across the Manhattan Bridge. Walking across the bridge, he was still
                            disoriented and he still thought he saw the Twin Towers as he walked
                            over the bridge. He headed to Forest Hills, Queens where his sister
                            lived. He had finally come across a payphone and waited on the line and
                            called his sister. She told him that the Towers collapsed. John’s son
                            worked on the 80th floor, and she was able to give John the good news
                            that his son was safe. John continued to work security around the
                            building after the attacks. His company provided him Tyvek suits and
                            respirators, so he was protected head to toe, but city agencies
                            controlled most of the area. The Deutsche Bank had other office
                            buildings so eventually he reported to work on 52nd Street, and then on
                            Wall Street. They found a coworker’s remains 6 months later. Eventually
                            the building was dismantled, and John retired in 2005. John has lasting
                            effects from this tragedy. He avoids 9/11 conversations and TV footage.
                            He suffers from mini-flashbacks and living so close to JFK airport, the
                            low flying planes make relive the events. He also has survivors’ guilt
                            because he sees the FDNY/NYPD rushing into the building to their deaths.
                            John is grateful that he survived and he doesn’t want anyone to forget
                            the 343 fireman and the 60 NYPD that perished. He is glad that he was
                            down there and saw what really went on instead of getting his
                            information from the TV.

       Chuck has been a Suffolk County Police Officer for 33 years. He began his
                            career with Port Authority and currently is the Commanding Officer for
                            the SCPD District Attorney’s Squad. Born and raised in Smithtown, New
                            York, he has a wife and four grown sons. On September 11th, Chuck was in
                            the Police Intelligence Squad, detailed to the FBI Joint Terrorist Task
                            Force. For the most part, his squad dealt with ALF (Animal Liberation
                            Front) and ELF (Earth Liberation Front), which are domestic terrorism
                            groups. That morning, he took an early train from the Ronkonkoma
                            station, intending to arrive in Manhattan at 8:30 for a meeting at 290
                            Broadway, which is the FBI building. The train got hung up outside the
                            tunnel to go into Penn Station. They thought it was regular train
                            traffic, but looking out the window, Chuck could see smoke in the
                            direction of the towers. Shortly after, he got a call not to go to
                            Broadway, but to go to a command center on Church Street because there
                            had been a terrorist attack at the Trade Center. Having always worked
                            with ALF and ELF, he was surprised that everyone was talking about OBL.
                            “OBL? What is OBL?!” and this was his first introduction to Osama Bin
                            Laden. But no one was really putting two and two together yet; it was
                            not registering yet that a commercial airline could be used in this way.
                            At the command post it occurred to him that there was more chaos than
                            order: people were still streaming in waiting for direction. They were
                            told to stand by and wait for instructions. There was a sense of
                            disbelief, now realizing that those planes were commercial airlines and
                            it was just inconceivable, unconscionable – Chuck was learning exactly
                            who Osama Bin Laden was. There was about 100 people assembled, but he
                            couldn’t keep his eyes off the towers, and saw that the upper portion
                            seemed to be tilting a little and no one was paying attention. He
                            yelled, “Run!” because the thought the building was coming down. “I’ve
                            never run so fast, before or since” to get out of the way of this
                            disaster. He ran about 30 or 50 yards and saw a plume – like a tsunami
                            of dust and debris and there was no way to out run it. He ducked in
                            between two buildings to get out of its immediate path – the dust was
                            really dense; so dense that you couldn’t see the guy standing next to
                            you. He thought to himself, “Wow, this is really bad, running and
                            breathing heavy, breathing this in” – he tried to wrap his tie around
                            his face to act as a filter but this was not effective. He saw a NYC
                            police officer who was so covered in dust that he couldn’t open his
                            eyes; the dust had almost an adhesive quality to it, it stuck to and
                            covered everything. Chuck got the officer to an EMT, the man was
                            coughing and throwing up. The EMT gave him a mask, but they were not
                            very effective, “flash forward to today and I can tell you they were NOT
                            effective.” Shortly after deciding to try and regroup back at the FBI
                            building they were caught in the plume of the second tower falling.
                            Chuck states that he doesn’t have any stories of heroism or saving
                            people, there were not a lot of people who needed saving. The
                            destruction was complete, all you had to do was look at the site to know
                            it. The site was massive, “looking out to this huge heap of burning
                            material – even if you heard someone calling for help, you couldn’t do
                            anything to help”. He says it wasn’t going to be a big robust rescue;
                            who could move a piece of cement that weighed 5,000 pounds, “and if I
                            could, to what end? It was unimaginable that anyone could have
                            survived.” That first day, Chuck was there until 12:30 or 1:00am and
                            things started to get some form and structure. A supervisor from the FBI
                            squad said to come back tomorrow and report to the FBI’s parking garage,
                            which was being transformed into a huge command post. On the way home,
                            he stopped in to the emergency room at Saint Catherine’s hospital in
                            Smithtown because it felt like there was a blow torch in his lungs. The
                            doctors couldn’t really do anything for him; they flushed his eyes but
                            said his lungs would have to heal on their own. He left there “not
                            feeling too good about that explanation”. The next day, at the new
                            location, they began to peruse leads and start the investigation. He was
                            assigned to the “lead desk” in the I44 Squad (domestic terrorism) where
                            he fielded phone calls from all over the country – taking leads and
                            disseminating the information for people to act on. One night Chuck got
                            to work for his normal 10pm – 10am shift and was catching up on some
                            paperwork when they were told not to leave, that something had happened
                            and they would need all of them available. “Oh no, what now?” One of the
                            big studios (ABC or NBC, he can’t remember which) had a small child
                            contract anthrax while in the studio. They teamed up with doctors from
                            the CDC to conduct interviews. He finished up around 4:00am and went
                            home. His wife got up at 6:00am and put on the news like she always did,
                            and there’s “men in space suits” entering the building he just left with
                            the reporters talking about anthrax exposure, “Oh my God I was just
                            there.” He was more angry then panicked, and went to work. When he got
                            to work, his supervisor said “Oh before you get settled in…” he had to
                            go get screened for anthrax, and had to take prophylactic antibiotics to
                            be sure he was ok. By December it became clear to Chuck that this was
                            not the normal criminal entity he was working with, and he couldn’t
                            really help any more. “Let the Marines and the SEALs take care of it.”
                            He told his supervisors that he wanted to transfer back to SCPD and they
                            were ok with that. He states that 9/11 had no real effect on what he
                            feels every day, but if he thinks about it or sees anything from that
                            time it brings him right back like it was yesterday. His sense of
                            humanity – of good and evil – has been shaped in a very real way. He has
                            “very strong opinions about Islam, the so called religion of peace”, but
                            says there are bad people in the world, it’s always been like this. To
                            future generations, he would say: Be prepared. Just when you think you
                            are safe, you probably aren’t.

       On September 11, 2001, Ronald Stoever was a Suffolk County Police
                            Officer. His career began in 1983 as an NYPD officer and then in 1986
                            moved to SCPD, and retired in 2012. Ronald has lived on LI all of his
                            life, and is married with 4 children and 6 grandchildren. Ronald was on
                            a 9-5 tour and he heard about the attacks over the radio and saw the
                            footage on TV. His brother was NYPD and remained at Ground Zero until
                            Dec 2001. Ronald immediately wanted to help, so he contacted the local
                            radio station, WBAB, who had been collecting donations. He offered to
                            drive the goods to the site and since he was SCPD, he had the
                            credentials to get the donations all the way downtown. He had contacts
                            that supplied him with box trucks for transporting the goods, and he
                            assisted with collecting, separating and organizing the collection
                            efforts. His first delivery was on 9/12/01. He would continue to make
                            these trips on his days off for months. On occasion, his older children
                            would accompany him on the trip. The attacks on WTC had a profound
                            effect on Ronald because he is one of the very few people who know
                            exactly how the passengers on the planes felt before they perished. In
                            1970, when Ronald was just 12 years old, he was on Pan Am Flight 93,
                            from Amsterdam to NYC, which was hijacked by the PLO (Palestine
                            Liberation Organization) and brought to Beirut, Lebanon. The plane took
                            off again and made an emergency landing in Beirut, Lebanon. Ronald
                            explained the grueling events in detail, from the hijackers
                            interrogating passengers, searching for US Military and people of Jewish
                            decent to sliding off the emergency slide without shoes, and looking
                            back seeing the plane explode as he ran away as fast as he could (as per
                            his father’s instructions). Eventually he was reunited with his father
                            and returned to the US via a flight from Rome, where he then was
                            reunited with his mother and siblings. Ronald feels even 44 years later,
                            the destruction hasn’t ended for senseless beliefs. His brother still
                            suffers mentally and physically from ailments directly related to 9/11.
                            He knows that he was given a second chance after his hijacking and being
                            to give the little that he did for the First Responders does give him
                            some satisfaction, but he does think about and wonder, what is going to
                            happen next?

       Currently working as a Bioengineer, Eric was interning in his senior year
                            of college in New Jersey when 9/11 took place. While he was driving into
                            work, he heard about what had happened on the local radio show, Z100,
                            and knew that he would volunteer to help in any way possible. Eric, a
                            volunteer EMT in North Jersey, went into lower Manhattan later that
                            evening on his own. Eventually meeting up with his squadron, he stayed
                            mainly at Stuyvesant High School helping with the triage center.
                            Preparing meals for the firefighters and helping them wash out their
                            eyes. He stayed volunteering downtown for 18 hours straight, helping as
                            much as he could. Emotionally drained and physically exhausted, he made
                            his way home to North Jersey. Looking back on his experience
                            volunteering down at Ground Zero, it had pushed his future into a
                            medical career. Eric continues to volunteer all over the world and he
                            attributes his strength and courage on the strong impact 9/11 had on his
                            life. A positive aspect of the events, according to Eric, was watching
                            everyone come together in a time of need. Putting all their best feet
                            forward and offering their expertise to work as a cohesive unit.

       Robert began his interview by stating it was easy to prepare for today,
                            because “these thoughts and feelings have never gone away – will never
                            disappear.” Robert will be 78 years old next month. He was raised in the
                            South Bronx and graduated from college in 1958. He served in the Army,
                            and in 1960 he moved to the West Village. His a clinical social worker,
                            and has practiced psychotherapy for many years. In 1970 he formed the
                            Psychological Consulting Group; he retired early in 1992 and currently
                            works 2-3 days per week. Robert and his wife Barbara live on Morton
                            Street, and could see the World Trade Center out their windows – they
                            watched it being built and saw the Twin Towers daily until 9/11. For
                            many, many years it was part of their landscape, “very much a part of
                            our neighborhood and the West Village.” On September 11th, Robert had
                            gone to the subway at 8:45am, and as he was about to descend into the
                            tunnel he heard a huge plane go by. As he reached the turnstile, he
                            heard a noise but didn’t think much of it, it was just “a city noise”.
                            He walked 2 blocks to his first appointment, and at 10:30 or 11:00 he
                            was expecting a phone call at home, so he called his voicemail. The
                            first message was from a friend who lived in Australia, “Are you
                            alright? Please call me!” – Robert’s reaction was, “What?” The next
                            message was from his daughter in California, then a message from
                            Barbara. He finds it very ironic that he heard about an event happening
                            in his own backyard via a phone call from Australia. Barbara came to his
                            office, and they listened to the radio. When he heard about the Trade
                            Center being struck, he realized that the noise he had heard was the
                            plane hitting the tower. They were able to take the subway home, and
                            immediately there was an indescribable smell – people all over the city
                            could smell it depending on the wind, but they could smell it all the
                            time. “That memory, that smell – it will never go away.” They were not
                            as conscious then of the environment as they are now, but they knew it
                            had to be bad. Robert knew there would be a need for what he did, and as
                            a New Yorker he could relate to what people were experiencing. At this
                            point the New York Red Cross was “running the show” and because of his
                            background with the war on poverty he was asked to work with the
                            residents of Battery Park who had been displaced. They “lost neighbors,
                            relatives, friends; their jobs disappeared…many, many people who were
                            traumatized.” His primary duty was to the residents, but did talk to
                            some “diggers” and recovery workers. “Here’s some black humor for
                            you...” Most of the volunteers who came had experience with natural
                            disasters, but no experience in an urban area. The usually slept in
                            tents with mud, and these “brave, good hearted people were staying at
                            The Waldorf Astoria, The Plaza – staying at the finest places and eating
                            at the finest restaurants [for free].” Some became ambivalent and had a
                            lot of guilty or uncomfortable feelings about being there and being
                            treated that way. Robert became a “tour guide and councilor” to these
                            volunteers also. Even though Robert had access to the entire site, he
                            often averted his eyes. He didn’t need to look: the scene was indelibly
                            imprinted in his mind. He hadn’t been back to the site until the museum
                            opened. He found the museum to be disturbing but “appropriately so”, he
                            had expected it to be. What he felt to be much more disturbing was the
                            crowds of people around the memory pools acting so disrespectfully -
                            taking “selfies” with funny poses, completely disconnected from the
                            event. He states it was not just an occasional person, it was a
                            significant number of people acting this way, “like they were at Disney
                            Land.” Early in the timeline of the event, there was tremendous love,
                            support and respect. “That’s changed now – the level of feelings that
                            exist in the United States – we have dumbed things down and lowered our
                            standards. We’ve become immune to death.” He states we don’t see footage
                            of drones, there is no draft, and people are more and more distant. The
                            New York Red Cross was terrific, but Robert feels the American Red Cross
                            was terrible: he states they came in and tried to impose a template at
                            the site, “that was probably good if the Mississippi overflowed” but
                            didn’t work here. It wasn’t the same after they took over, there were
                            “turf wars” and the culture at the site changed. He left the site before
                            the holiday season with a sense of relief. He was angry that the
                            American Red Cross made him want to leave, but “the anger was softened
                            by the relief.” To future generations, Robert would say, “I hope that
                            they pay attention.” He states when he went to high school and college,
                            they studied history: “I knew the authors, the music, the athletes [of
                            the past] – it’s part of becoming educated and growing – knowing how
                            things started.” This is not how things are now and “I hope to God there
                            are enough young people who are interested enough and connected enough
                            that they want to know – and are open to ‘knowing’.”

       At the time of 9/11, Chris was a narcotics detective in the NYPD. He’s
                            now on the anti-terrorism unit and has been on the force for 23 years.
                            He was born in Brooklyn but moved to Babylon as child. On 9/11, after
                            the attacks happened, he picked up his father-in-law, who was stranded
                            at a Path subway station. He took him home, went to Home Depot to load
                            up on supplies, and got to the site around noon. That first day, he
                            worked until about 2 or 3am, and was schedule to return by 7am the next
                            morning. He went home and undressed in the yard so he didn’t bring his
                            clothes in the house. For the first month, he worked 16 hours days,
                            seven days a week, and then moved to twelve hour shifts. In all, he did
                            56 working tours, including a few at the morgue and Freshkills landfill.
                            He worked the Bucket Brigade until Thanksgiving, then moved to more
                            security-like work around the area. Chris recalls that in the beginning,
                            the responders didn’t think of their personal safety or how it was
                            affecting them. He shared some things with his wife, who was also the
                            daughter of a cop. His kids now know what he did, but they were very
                            young at the time. Chris marveled at how quickly an infrastructure and
                            resources like the Red Cross were established, and talked about the
                            destruction. He also touched upon the credit he feels is due to local
                            law enforcement and officials, rather than national agencies, and that
                            he believes NY’s response to 9/11 has shaped subsequent disaster
                            responses. Chris worked the 1993 bombing, and believes that the
                            terrorists had been planning 9/11 since that foiled attack. Chris has
                            been to the doctor for respiratory issues several times since 9/11. He
                            believes it’s his job to keep his family safe and make sure he comes
                            home every day. He says, “It was my job, and I’d do it again.”

       John also known as Jack, grew up in the Bronx and later moved to
                            Sayville. It took John awhile to adapt to the slower pace of the
                            suburbs. While John lived in Sayville he worked at a public school in
                            maintenance. John took many civil service exams and when he was
                            twenty-six he took the police civil service exam. He always looked up to
                            police officers, however, he never wanted to become one. John started
                            working for the New York City Transit Police in 1986. His job was to
                            monitor the trains during the peak times of when crimes would occur.
                            However, John re-took the police civil service exam because he wanted to
                            become a regular city officer. At the time 9/11, John worked for the
                            court system. John generated the rap sheets for criminals and made sure
                            the prisoners were arraigned within twenty-four hours. On the day of
                            9/11, John had received a phone call from one of his friends saying that
                            he should turn on the television. John was working a shift that day and
                            arrived to work an hour early. On his way to work John discussed how his
                            vehicle was the only car on the road. John’s court was eight blocks away
                            from the World Trade Center. When he arrived at work John recognized a
                            distinct smell in the air. He said the area around the World Trade
                            Center smelt like gun powder and death. The City hired a surveyor to
                            look at the towers. The surveyor realized that the tower was going to
                            fall and ordered everyone to evacuate. As John was leaving the site, he
                            looked back and described the scene as something out of a movie. He
                            noticed some of his coworkers who started their shift earlier that day
                            and saw how they were all dusted up. Most of them were picking up dead
                            bodies and one of the female officers began to cry because of the
                            gruesomeness of the job. When building Number 7 of the World Trade
                            collapsed there was only one hose pumping water. All of the water mains
                            broke that day and the firetruck had to get the water from the river.
                            John had worked till six that morning and couldn’t return to the courts
                            until the communication system was live again. After 9/11, John had two
                            jobs. One job was to go to the morgue and the other was to help secure
                            the area around the World Trade Center. When John was stationed at the
                            morgue it left a lasting image of the brutality of the events that had
                            occurred in 9/11. Many of the bodies were cut in half by steel. John
                            retired in 2003 and people were still reclaiming property left from
                            9/11. After the events of 9/11, John had suffered from vivid nightmares
                            and heart palpitations. While at the site John was only wearing a paper
                            mask. Today, John suffers from throat tightness. Back in 2012, John had
                            a heart attack due to his nightmares of 9/11.

       At the time of 9/11/2001, Timmy was employed by National Grid. Aside from
                            his employment with National grid, Timmy was also a volunteer fire
                            fighter and served four years in the Marine Corp. When he first heard
                            the news about the 9/11 attacks he was working at the National Grid
                            facility in Far Rockaway. During this time he was finishing his job and
                            preparing to leave. Although the facility where he worked were
                            barricading the entrances and exits for security purposes, Timmy was
                            able to return to the yard and then proceed home. Timmy arrived at the
                            site on Thursday, September 13, 2001. Upon arrival, Timmy described the
                            scene before him like something out of the movies. It was not the
                            Manhattan that he knew. The streets were all but deserted except for
                            debris, dust and papers. During his time at the World Trade Center site,
                            which lasted until May of 2002, Timmy was responsible for distributing
                            supplies to various staging areas as well decontaminating vehicles that
                            were leaving the site. Out of all of the negativity surrounding that
                            horrific day, Timmy chooses to remember the positives. He says “out of
                            the worst situations you can always find something good.” There were
                            many positive examples of humanity that Timmy had witnessed. While
                            riding his quad through the site, he recalls meeting a man he refers to
                            as “Bob“. He gave Bob a ride on his quad and discovered that Bob lived
                            nearby and wanted to come to the site and see what he could do to help.
                            He recalls saying to Bob that “as long as you are here, I’m here.” Along
                            the way they came across a group of firefighters who were in need of a
                            ride. Attached to his quad was a trailer so he was able to take the
                            firefighters as well. Timmy was surprised to find out that the fire
                            fighters weren’t directing him to head to the fire house but rather to a
                            pickup truck with Florida plates. They wanted to return to the truck so
                            they could get some rest. Timmy also remembers seeing a limping woman
                            while he was making his rounds to the staging areas. Prior to seeing
                            this woman, he had stocked up on donated Dr. Scholl’s shoe inserts. He
                            remembers putting them into his glove box. When he saw the limping woman
                            he pulled out of the inserts and told her to use these. He later ran
                            into the same woman and saw her still limping. He asked what had
                            happened and she said that she gave it to a firefighter that was in
                            need. Timmy then gave her some additional inserts for her to use. He
                            says you saw a lot of that day, people helping each other and working
                            together he said it was “amazing.” These days Timmy says that he is more
                            optimistic. He says “it could be worse because I’ve seen the worst.” As
                            a first responder, he says that he is proud of the fact that he was able
                            to do his part but does not consider himself a hero. He says he was
                            there to do his job. He says the heroes from 9/11 are people like Bob
                            and the other volunteers. From this horrific event, Timmy says that “the
                            world should remember what hate did, but it should also remember what
                            happened when people came together and worked together.”

       Bill is a self-described “war baby” who grew up in Hempstead. It was a
                            wonderful place to grow up and he had friends from all walks of life. He
                            worked in the Nassau Police Department for 25 years and currently lives
                            on Long Island in Kings Park. On September 11th, he was retired and
                            working a seasonal position with the Park Police at Sunken Meadow State
                            Park. When they heard the first tower had been hit, he thought it was
                            unlikely that they would be called in. Then the second plane hit, and
                            they had to lock down the park. The Park Police were not called in right
                            away, other younger “regulars” went in first and they arrived on
                            September 14th. Bill didn’t know what to expect, but generally speaking
                            was not afraid; he knew this would be a long term assignment. He states
                            that they were a police presence because people were afraid there was
                            going to be another attack. It was a pleasant surprise that people were
                            happy to see them – “as a cop, no one is ever happy to see you”; it was
                            a surprising show of support. Bill lost a friend named Wally in the
                            attacks. They found his gun, but never did recover a body. The gun is
                            now in the National Firearms Museum, and Bill believes this would make
                            Wally happy. Bill states that George W. Bush had it right when he said
                            we would be in a war like no other war. There is no real battle ground –
                            they “get you where they get you – these people are crazy.” Bill
                            believes that “they hate us, want to kill us – the more the better.”
                            When asked what he would tell future generations about the events of
                            September 11th, Bill wants people to know that this generation did the
                            best they could. They responded immediately and did over and above.
                            “This is not a cut and dry kind of warfare – it’s not anything anyone in
                            this country would ever think of.”

       Mario came to this country from Italy in 1968 when he was 10 years old.
                            His father is a widower, and he came to Chicago to visit family; they
                            stayed in Chicago for 3 years and then settled in Brooklyn, NY. When he
                            was 15, Mario started working in a bakery in Manhattan. He also worked
                            in construction with his older brother for about 6 years and got into
                            the carpenters union at 24 or 25 years old. He married in 1986 and moved
                            to Franklin Square. Mario worked in the World Trade Center since 1987 as
                            a sub-contractor. In 2000, they moved upstate and about a year into it
                            decided it wasn’t for him – he missed the city and Brooklyn. He moved
                            back to NYC and his old boss took him back at the WTC where his duties
                            included maintenance, sheet rocking, framing rooms to new lease
                            specifications, etc. On September 11th, Mario was at work on the 101st
                            floor in Building 1, the North Tower, outside the Canter Fitzgerald
                            offices. This is where he would get coffee every morning and eat
                            breakfast; he was friends with a lot of the Canter Fitzgerald security
                            guards and employees since he did a lot of work for them in their
                            offices. Mario recalls that the sub-contractor that he worked for had
                            the maintenance contract with the WTC but their contract was up, so he
                            figured “oh well!” and broke the rules, taking the regular elevator car
                            down. This small act of defiance saved his life: if he had waited for
                            the much slower service elevator, he would have been standing outside
                            Canter Fitzgerald when the first plane hit. Down on floor B4, he was
                            talking to his friend Vito and they heard a huge BOOM and the weights
                            from the elevators were coming down the shaft. They didn’t know if a
                            boiler had exploded or what. The lights started flickering on and off,
                            and it became chaotic. “It was like an earthquake.” Some of the
                            secretaries from Turner [building maintenance] were injured when duct
                            work smashed into them – one girl had her teeth knocked out and another
                            had a filing cabinet fall on her. There were tremendous vibrations and
                            shaking. Steam was bellowing out of the boilers, blocking their way out
                            – they would have been burned if they tried to go through it. They were
                            able to make their way to the B5 stairway. Mario’s eyes were burning
                            from the carbon monoxide in the air, and they kept going up the stairs.
                            They were by the pay phones in the lobby when the second plane hit. He
                            was able to phone his sister, and she screamed at him to get out – it
                            was chaos, people had started to jump out of the building and the cops
                            had to tell them which exit to use so they would not be injured by the
                            falling bodies. “Thank God I didn’t see any jumpers.” He exited the
                            building on Church Street, and there was an inch high of debris – paper,
                            glass, shoes, and personal things. Mario felt like he was in shock, he
                            had to be careful where he walked because there were human remains
                            everywhere. They were heading to the South Overpass and things were
                            still falling; they began to joke about how they were all set because
                            there would be so much work for them to do – then, they heard a
                            crackling sound, and the building began pancaking: they heard boom,
                            boom, boom slowly at first, then really fast [as the building
                            collapsed]. He started running – he lost track of his friend – and ended
                            up by Albany Street with a tsunami of debris and smoke coming at him. He
                            dove into a large car, and Impala “probably a cop car” and was cursing
                            himself for not leaving sooner. He kept hearing the fire department
                            alarms going off. When he could, he started walking again and found a
                            man named Sean; he said, “Sean, we’re dead.” He couldn’t catch his
                            breath, his shirt over his face was ineffectual as a filter. They were
                            heading north, and got to Battery Park City by the water. Eventually,
                            Mario ended up in Little Italy, where no one knew what to do. He started
                            walking again towards the Manhattan Bridge to go to Brooklyn. He was
                            able to make contact with his nephew, and he got Mario to Brooklyn. He
                            recalls being so angry, if there had been a place to enlist he would
                            have. He knew it was a terrorist attack, but no one knew who did it and
                            they were scared that there might be another attack. Mario said that the
                            dust that was in his hair was like cement: he couldn’t get his hands
                            through it. The next day, he went to a clinic because he couldn’t blink,
                            and was told his eyes were lacerated from debris. They gave him drops,
                            but for a week he couldn’t open them when he woke up without washing
                            them with water. Breathing was ok, but mentally was a little strange and
                            he spoke to a psychologist for about a week via phone. He was told he
                            had survivor’s guilt; so many people he knew were lost. He also became
                            paranoid and hated to hear a plane fly by. Everything seemed different;
                            now he will only sit on the isle where he can see an exit and knows at
                            all times “what’s the best way to get outta here.” After a week, Mario
                            went back to work as a carpenter. He worked a 12 hour shift, but
                            couldn’t do it – he was shaky, thought the buildings would fall.
                            “Watching the fire and police carry out body parts – couldn’t do it.” He
                            stayed home for a month, but life goes on and the bills keep showing up.
                            When he returned, he worked at the Pit for seven months, ten hour days,
                            6-7 days a week. It helped to work with some people he knew setting up
                            the trailers and ramps; they were working in ash up to their ankles in
                            the basement. He couldn’t stand to be in a confined place, and his
                            supervisor got him a spot working outside with the trailers. “The
                            smell…the smell…breathing in all the guys I knew who died.” Mario’s wife
                            says he has changed, that he ‘snaps’ easily. His oldest kids refuse to
                            talk about it; they were in school during the event and the schools
                            handled it badly. “They’d like to blank it out.” Mario says that losing
                            people he worked with for so many years is like the Twilight Zone – he
                            lost over 100 people that he knew and was friends with: “[the WTC] was a
                            community, its own little world. “ He was friends with everyone from all
                            areas of the towers and the Port Authority. Anniversaries bring up the
                            wounds “especially if I’m at home and listen to the names since I knew
                            them.” To future generations, Mario would say: Situations come about and
                            you have to deal with them no matter what; don’t lose track that you are
                            a human being. He hopes we can live in harmony, but “I love history, and
                            history shows us we never live in harmony. Do what you have to do to get
                            along, time waits for nobody.” Mario came to this country from Italy in
                            1968 when he was 10 years old. His father is a widower, and he came to
                            Chicago to visit family; they stayed in Chicago for 3 years and then
                            settled in Brooklyn, NY. When he was 15, Mario started working in a
                            bakery in Manhattan. He also worked in construction with his older
                            brother for about 6 years and got into the carpenters union at 24 or 25
                            years old. He married in 1986 and moved to Franklin Square. Mario worked
                            in the World Trade Center since 1987 as a sub-contractor. In 2000, they
                            moved upstate and about a year into it decided it wasn’t for him – he
                            missed the city and Brooklyn. He moved back to NYC and his old boss took
                            him back at the WTC where his duties included maintenance, sheet
                            rocking, framing rooms to new lease specifications, etc. On September
                            11th, Mario was at work on the 101st floor in Building 1, the North
                            Tower, outside the Canter Fitzgerald offices. This is where he would get
                            coffee every morning and eat breakfast; he was friends with a lot of the
                            Canter Fitzgerald security guards and employees since he did a lot of
                            work for them in their offices. Mario recalls that the sub-contractor
                            that he worked for had the maintenance contract with the WTC but their
                            contract was up, so he figured “oh well!” and broke the rules, taking
                            the regular elevator car down. This small act of defiance saved his
                            life: if he had waited for the much slower service elevator, he would
                            have been standing outside Canter Fitzgerald when the first plane hit.
                            Down on floor B4, he was talking to his friend Vito and they heard a
                            huge BOOM and the weights from the elevators were coming down the shaft.
                            They didn’t know if a boiler had exploded or what. The lights started
                            flickering on and off, and it became chaotic. “It was like an
                            earthquake.” Some of the secretaries from Turner [building maintenance]
                            were injured when duct work smashed into them – one girl had her teeth
                            knocked out and another had a filing cabinet fall on her. There were
                            tremendous vibrations and shaking. Steam was bellowing out of the
                            boilers, blocking their way out – they would have been burned if they
                            tried to go through it. They were able to make their way to the B5
                            stairway. Mario’s eyes were burning from the carbon monoxide in the air,
                            and they kept going up the stairs. They were by the pay phones in the
                            lobby when the second plane hit. He was able to phone his sister, and
                            she screamed at him to get out – it was chaos, people had started to
                            jump out of the building and the cops had to tell them which exit to use
                            so they would not be injured by the falling bodies. “Thank God I didn’t
                            see any jumpers.” He exited the building on Church Street, and there was
                            an inch high of debris – paper, glass, shoes, and personal things. Mario
                            felt like he was in shock, he had to be careful where he walked because
                            there were human remains everywhere. They were heading to the South
                            Overpass and things were still falling; they began to joke about how
                            they were all set because there would be so much work for them to do –
                            then, they heard a crackling sound, and the building began pancaking:
                            they heard boom, boom, boom slowly at first, then really fast [as the
                            building collapsed]. He started running – he lost track of his friend –
                            and ended up by Albany Street with a tsunami of debris and smoke coming
                            at him. He dove into a large car, and Impala “probably a cop car” and
                            was cursing himself for not leaving sooner. He kept hearing the fire
                            department alarms going off. When he could, he started walking again and

                            Eventually, Mario ended up in Little Italy, where no one knew what to
                            do. He started walking again towards the Manhattan Bridge to go to
                            Brooklyn. He was able to make contact with his nephew, and he got Mario
                            to Brooklyn. He recalls being so angry, if there had been a place to

       Charlie was born in Connecticut, and moved to Long Island when he was
                            seven years old. He is married with one daughter and a granddaughter. He
                            became a police officer in 1982, wanting the action and to be able to
                            help people. September 11th was his first day at work after vacation. He
                            reported in at 3:00am because he was the sergeant in charge of setting
                            up for the election that day. He had a lot of police in the Times Square
                            area, so he gathered them all and went straight to the site. There was
                            chaos on the streets – they were trying to organize the people and get
                            them on rosters so that there would be documentation who was with him.
                            As they got closer to the site, they began to see wounded people. They
                            had to park their van and proceed on foot – there were a lot of people
                            walking in a daze; they were burned, wearing suits, and still holding
                            their briefcases. Charlie and his men were right outside the second
                            tower when the second plane hit – it was a huge noise. They took cover
                            under scaffolding, and an [airplane] engine landed half a block from
                            where they were. Charlie recalls that people were in shock, not knowing
                            what was going on; they were very disoriented and seemed to not be
                            thinking properly. One woman he met wanted to go back into the tower
                            because she forgot her purse. Around this time they were ordered to
                            Vesey Street to make a secure spot and started to see jumpers. They had
                            to take cover to avoid getting hit [by the bodies]. They were trying to
                            get organized and keep it together, but it was starting to sink in how
                            bad it was. One officer was trying to say a prayer for each jumper, and
                            Charlie had to tell him to stop – it was too much. He had to be stern,
                            and remembers feeling badly about that, but it was just too much to keep
                            hearing. Charlie worked until 2am, slept at the precinct for two hours
                            and then went back. It was a war zone – there were two inches of dust,
                            paper and debris to walk through. He was climbing through metal and
                            searching the pile, knowing there were people under there and just
                            hoping for the best. Charlie says his family was, and is, very close –
                            but it was a burden to take care of him. When the buildings came down
                            and he was caught in the plume, it “felt like you were body surfing in
                            the ocean” and it was a month before he realized he had broken his back.
                            He was in pain, a constant ache, and didn’t think too much about it. He
                            finally got checked out and two years later had surgery to fuse his
                            spine. He doesn’t talk to his family and friends too often about his
                            time at ground zero; he knew Moira Smith and it was hard to hear her
                            call for help and fade away. He remembers her daughter is 15 years old
                            now. It bothers Charlie to be defined as a 9/11 responder. “Maybe
                            because I made it out and so many others didn’t.” When asked what he
                            would like future generations to remember, he says that we can’t forget.
                            He remembers that when he was young, he thought Pearl Harbor was no big
                            deal, and is ashamed of that feeling now. “That’s why I’m doing this
                            [interview] – people can’t forget, don’t let it fade away.”

       Andrew was born in Manhattan. Before he turned ten years old, Andrew
                            moved out from New York City to Lake Ronkonkoma. Andrew is currently
                            still living in Lake Ronkonkoma with his three sons. He is a spiritual
                            person but wouldn’t call himself religious. He believes that God is for
                            everyone. Andrew worked in law enforcement. After he graduated high
                            school, Andrew tried to get into the Marines. However, Andrew suffered
                            from a leg injury and his application for the Marines was turned down.
                            After his application was turned down, Andrew took two civil service
                            exams. One exam was for PD and the other exam was to qualify as a
                            corrections officer. Andrew took the corrections officer position
                            because they were the first ones to call him back. He worked as a
                            corrections officer for twenty years. On the day of 9/11, he was working
                            as a corrections officer. Andrew’s shift began at five in the morning at
                            Rikers Island. Smoke from the World Trade Center had been visible for
                            miles and Andrew saw the smoke from Rikers. Andrew didn’t think much of
                            it at first. He went to his unit’s home base and saw the catastrophe
                            going on at the World Trade on the television. As a precaution, Rikers
                            Island was put into lockdown. No one knew exactly about the events that
                            were occurring at the time and as a preventative measure the jail made
                            sure all inmates were in their cells. During the mid to late afternoon
                            hours the facility began to cut officers loose in order to avoid
                            overtime pay. Andrew got cut from his shift and went down to the World
                            Trade Center to help out. Before Andrew went to the World Trade on 9/11,
                            he had called his family on his Verizon phone. He doesn’t remember the
                            drive into the City. Andrew got to the towers quick and easy because
                            roadblocks were being set up. He remembers the walk approaching the
                            World Trade. There were ashes everywhere and it was very dark and dusty.
                            When he arrived at the site he had seen that people were already working
                            on controlling the situation. Andrew joined with a firemen crew and went
                            to go search for anyone that was in distress. He noticed the amount of
                            physical damage and destruction. Numerous vehicles were crushed by
                            debris. Andrew tried to digest the situation. He left early that morning
                            and went home. Andrew slept for a limited number of hours and returned
                            to work at five in the morning the next day. When he got to work they
                            sent him back to the World Trade Center. Andrew wanted to go back to the
                            site to help. He worked twelve hour shifts. Andrew was working down at
                            the site till February. His job made it mandatory to give the workers at
                            least a day off during the clean-up efforts. Later on the days off
                            helped Andrew refresh his mind. When he arrived at the site he was given
                            no protective gear. Andrew wasn’t concerned with the air at first but
                            then he was given a paper mask. He was focused on work and didn’t
                            account for the future health concerns that may arise. Andrew knew that
                            he wasn’t going to find any live bodies and realized that this situation
                            went from a rescue mission to a recovery effort. The work was tedious
                            but it was something that had to be done. At the site, Andrew worked
                            with different police officers every day. When Andrew arrived to his
                            house after his shifts he tried to keep work events separate from home
                            life. After the events of 9/11 Andrew became more aware of his
                            surroundings. He hasn’t returned to Ground Zero since 9/11. During the
                            clean-up, the iron workers and welders made crosses out of the buildings
                            steel beams. Because Andrew is a spiritual person, it helped him cope
                            while responding. Andrew would have done nothing differently during the
                            response effort on 9/11. He doesn’t like being called a hero for his
                            work during 9/11. Andrew believes that the true heroes are military
                            personnel. After responding to 9/11, Andrew states that there is always
                            something that brings you back to these events. Andrew goes to the gym
                            in order to help cope with stress. In the future, Andrew may want to
                            seek out more therapy to aid him in reflecting about the events of 9/11.

       Paul was born in Haiti and moved to Brooklyn, New York in 1968 when he
                            was 14 years old. He recalls it being quite a culture shock, and
                            learning to speak English from the kids who lived next door. His mother
                            became ill and he and his siblings were split up; Paul moved to Indiana
                            and stayed there until 1989 when he moved back to New York. Having
                            always had a dream to become an actor, Paul met some teamsters backstage
                            at an audition and ended up being hired into Local 52, Theatrical
                            Lighting. For the last 16 years he has worked on the television show Law
                            and Order. The morning of September 11th, Paul received a phone call
                            from his brother telling him that a plane had flown into the towers. His
                            first reaction was disbelief, but he immediately began making phone
                            calls to try and find out how he could help. The following day he spoke
                            to someone in his union and found that they were going in to volunteer,
                            so he went with them. Paul says his motivation for wanting to volunteer
                            was because so many lives had been lost. He states he is naturally a
                            kindhearted person and felt that if he could save someone by searching
                            through the rubble, he would be completely content. The volunteer’s from
                            Local 52 had the task to illuminate the area, just as they do for movie
                            sets. Paul says that the disaster looked very much like a movie set, but
                            there was no one filming; this was ‘the real deal.’ And although they
                            were there to light the area, when workers needed a break from the
                            bucket brigade Paul would jump in and take their place. He recalls
                            picking through the rubble with his bare hands, and passing the buckets
                            back and forth. He recalls the area beneath where they were standing was
                            hollow and there were many opportunities for workers to get hurt. Paul
                            describes the physical and emotional toll the work has taken on him. He
                            has breathing and sinus issues, as well as difficulty recalling his time
                            down there as becoming upset when he talks about or recalls that time
                            period. He was advised by a psychiatrist to confront the issue. Paul
                            also states that God tells us to forgive, but he has a hard time
                            forgiving Osama Bin Laden; if he could give his life to bring back all
                            those who died, he would. In closing, Paul says he is a simple man who
                            saw people in need and wanted to help.

       Growing up, Bob described himself as being from a typical family. He was
                            born in the Bronx but grew up in the Rockaways. Ironically, his wife was
                            born in the same hospital in the Bronx. In 1965, Bob and his wife moved
                            to New Jersey. Bob said that it was a move he made “kicking and
                            screaming”. Together they have three daughters and three grandchildren.
                            Bob is a writer and editor who has worked for various magazines in New
                            York City. He and his wife bought a weekly newspaper and published it
                            for twenty two years. During the time of September 11th 2001, Bob worked
                            for the Bergen County Sheriff’s Department specializing in
                            communications. Some of his responsibilities included handling
                            communications with the public, and coordinating press releases. He was
                            also a volunteer for the SPCA. On the day of September 11th, Bob was
                            heading into the Bergen county court office when he heard the news about
                            a plane hitting the World Trade Center. His initial thoughts went back
                            to the year 1945 when a B-25 Mitchell had hit the Empire State Building.
                            Upon learning about the second plane hitting the towers he said that
                            there was no doubt as to what it was. Immediately he had placed a call
                            to his wife who then expressed her concerns about their niece who works
                            on the 80th floor of the trade center. He later learned that his niece
                            was running late for work that day and was commuting by boat when the
                            news broke. The captain had quickly turned the boat around. Bob said his
                            niece was usually always early to work but she decided to sleep in that
                            morning. As a green Barrett and scout master in both New York and New
                            Jersey, Bob is very involved in the community. He says “give back and do
                            what you can.” He once stopped someone from committing suicide as well
                            as prevented muggings that were occurring in front of him. His wife said
                            to him “why is it always you?” He says that if it was one of his family
                            members he would hope that someone would do the same for them. He also
                            says “help, put your hand out, you never know when your hand is going to
                            be out reaching for help.” While going to the trade center, his middle
                            daughter pleaded with him not to go in. In order to keep her from
                            worrying about him, he had to lie. It was until later that evening that
                            Bob arrived at the site. Due to rumors about possible trucks carrying
                            explosives, bridges were closed. Rumors were flying “fast and furious”
                            and you had to always be on your toes. On the way there people jumped
                            out onto the west highway holding up signs saying “God Bless you, you
                            are our heroes.” It was moments like this that could bring a grown man
                            to tears. It was until he arrived did he realize the gravity of the
                            situation. Ambulances were backed in alongside the Javitz center and his
                            brother who is a doctor was sent away because there were no victims to
                            treat. He remembers the dust being so thick that you couldn’t see
                            anything and he was given a paper mask that didn’t amount to anything.
                            He recalls the time he worked on the pile stating that “it was a surreal
                            thing knowing that there were bodies in there.” Bob recalls the
                            camaraderie that he witnessed during his time at ground zero. He
                            remembers seeing tents from as far away as Israel and recalled people
                            driving down from Canada. Seeing people come together and help each
                            other out made him feel fantastic. Bob says that there is “inherent
                            goodness in people that come together.” One night while working
                            security, Bob noticed a woman pushing a boy in a stroller. While Bob
                            knelt down to see the boy the woman said “I just wanted him to see you.”
                            Everyone acted as one. There was no pulling of rank, everyone was doing
                            what they could. In the months to follow, he remembers Manhattan being
                            deserted which bothered him. He remembers you could get a ticket to any
                            show and you didn’t have to worry about looking both ways before
                            crossing the street. His wife was hesitant to go to dinner and a show in
                            Manhattan but Bob reminded her that “if we don’t go they’ve won.” Bob
                            recounts the consequences of working down at ground zero when he speaks
                            about his friend Jimmy Zadroga. Jimmy worked countless hours on the pile
                            against the pleading of his wife. He remembers seeing Jimmy pushing his
                            daughter in the stroller and seeing his oxygen tank laying in the back.
                            Jimmy passed away at the age of 32, leaving behind his young daughter.
                            Bob says the city had turned their back on Jimmy and didn’t give him and
                            his family what they deserved. “They would run him ragged, which was no
                            way to treat someone who was sick on the job.” Bob’s grandson Matt, who
                            is 17 years old has accompanied his grandfather to the oral history
                            project. During the grand opening of the Plaza, Matt created a unique
                            video capturing the event. Upon arrival, Bob was taken aback by seeing
                            people lined up with signs smiling and waving. It reminded him of the
                            sight he saw on the West Side Highway. His grandson Matt grabbed his
                            grandfather’s camera and seized the opportunity to film. Because the
                            grand opening of the Plaza was invitation only, Matt wanted to film what
                            was happening as a way to give people insight into what was going on.
                            Bob says “the video captures the humanity of those who died, those who
                            helped and the inhumanity of those that celebrated.” Through his
                            grandfather, Matt has gained a better and deeper understanding of the
                            events of 9/11. A link to Matt’s video can be located below. For future
                            generations, Bob stresses the importance of tolerance and learning to
                            live together and it starts with our children. He said that “children
                            need to be taught that they don’t have to love everyone but they do have
                            to respect one another.”

       Donald grew up in Brooklyn, born to immigrants who owned a bar and grill
                            until 1968. He went to vocational school and then served in the Marines.
                            He always looked up to the NYPD and took the test in 1977, and was
                            called in 1980. He worked in South Brooklyn and then Manhattan and the
                            UN. Then he was offered a dream job as a bomb tech. Donald worked on the
                            first WTC bombing in 1993. He was able to lead the FBI to the person
                            responsible for bringing the bomb into the building in the van. He
                            worked on the Bomb Squad for 16 years and then retired. Donald has a
                            wife and two children, who were in elementary at the time of the
                            attacks. On 9/11, Donald worked as a Security Supervisor at Merrill
                            Lynch. He happened to be at a seminar when the attack occurred, but then
                            he was paged and he reported to the building. He had the experience and
                            still had a report with his previous coworkers, so they all began to
                            work together: the Port Authority, NYPD, engineers, elevator mechanics,
                            and the NYFD. He helped evacuate the buildings. He was able to see the
                            damage to the building. His nostrils and lungs were burning from the
                            fumes, and he was having trouble breathing. The stairs were slippery
                            from the water from the fire systems. Donald watched Father Michael
                            Judge say the rosary as the “Jumpers” landed to their death. That is
                            when he was impacted on how severe the situation was. He saw some of the
                            FDNY crew for the last time as they ran up to try to save those who were
                            perishing above on the top floors. He began to hear the sounds of “metal
                            screaming” which was the frame and beams twisting. He knew the area was
                            no longer safe and began to seek shelter, making his way to the West
                            Side Highway. But as he tried to make his way there, a wave of debris
                            and dust started coming toward him, which sounded like a freight train.
                            The massive cloud swallowed everything in its path and he dove under a
                            fire truck and covered himself with his jacket. He thought he was blind
                            because everything was black. He couldn’t see his hands. He was having
                            difficulty breathing. Donald’s ribs and hip was injured, and he was
                            praying. Then the second building collapsed. Donald became unconscious.
                            He had on his NYPD retirement ring which had his badge number so he knew
                            he could be identified. He prayed again, he really thought he was going
                            to die. A fellow worker named Ray O’Hagan recognized him and helped
                            Donald get shelter. Ray got him water and eventually got him to Merrily
                            Lynch’s second location on Washington St. It was there that he was able
                            to shower and get a change of clothes. He was finally able to call home
                            on a satellite phone. He cried when he heard his kids’ and wife’s
                            voices. Donald made it home the following day via train and buses. When
                            he got home he slept and then sought medical treatment. Donald returned
                            to work even though he was injured. He had to be there even though he
                            may not have been useful. He got around in a golf cart and a cane. He
                            worked 6 days/week; 12 hrs/day for several months. He just felt that he
                            had to be there. During this time he began to see a chiropractor, who
                            offered free treatment when he expressed worry about being able to
                            afford the medical attention. Donald took a medical leave from his job
                            in 2002 and got a job with the US Marshals., but then failed their
                            medical exam after eight years on the job, he’s had six surgeries, some
                            cancer-related. Donald began to suffer from panic attacks and felt like
                            he was losing his mind. His wife didn’t know what to do for him. A
                            Vietnam vet at work got Donald to go to counseling, where he dealt with
                            all the traumas from his life and career and began to heal. It helped
                            him get his life back.

       Nick Acampora is an environmental inspector for the Dept of Environmental
                            Conservation. He has worked there since 1983. He responds to all
                            emergencies in his region (Region 2) which included Long Island and NYC
                            areas. He reports directly to the EPA the conditions of hazardous spills
                            and their holding tanks. Nick has a wife and three daughters. His
                            daughters were young at the time of 9/11 ranging from 1 year to middle
                            school age. On the morning of 9/11, Nick was driving on the NYS Thruway
                            to Lake Placid to a 3 day NY State meeting. He first learned of the
                            planes hitting on the radio. He had to stay upstate for the three days,
                            but he was lucky to not have anyone close who could have been affected
                            by the attacks. He knew his family was safe in Port Jefferson, LI. He
                            also learned that the few family members that worked in the city were
                            all fine. He was assigned to Ground Zero a month after 9/11, and worked
                            with a partner. Many of the structures surrounding the towers suffered
                            structural damage and he had to inspect and survey the petroleum,
                            hydraulic and hazardous spills resulting from the damage. On the first
                            day of reporting, Nick drove down to lower Manhattan and had to park his
                            car in Stuyvesant High School and walk the rest of the way to the site.
                            He got to the site via the Winter Garden Atrium which was severely
                            damaged. The pile that used to be WTC was so immense that words can’t
                            describe it. Nick believes the “Hard Hats” (Union Laborers, Con Ed,
                            Verizon and Red Cross workers) did not get enough recognition in their
                            recovery efforts. All of the buildings he had to go into looked like a
                            “freeze frame in time”. Nothing was touched but had a layer of dust on
                            it. Nick has a hard time understanding how people can be so filled with
                            hatred that they would want to destroy innocent people. He was happy to
                            know that we are doing this project because he wants everyone to know
                            what it was really like and not learn it from text books. He wants
                            everyone to know how hard everyone worked, and how all agencies worked
                            together to get the city running again. He is proud of how the nation
                            reacted at that time, but is saddened by how everyone has forgotten
                            about it thirteen years later. Nick does wish the government was upfront
                            regarding the air quality. He was able to see how terrible it was
                            because he was in the dark buildings without power and through the use
                            of his flashlight he was able to see all the debris floating in the air.
                            He wore a mask inside the buildings, but outside he didn’t because he
                            was told it wasn’t necessary, he was in the “open air”. He is hopeful
                            for the future, but at the same time he is skeptical and fears that the
                            terrorism will continue.

       Born in North Carolina, Jim moved to Baltimore with his family when he
                            was 5 or 6 years old. When he turned 19, he joined the Air Force and
                            served in Germany. His parents couldn’t afford college for him, and he
                            thought that the service was a good way to get away. He enjoyed it a
                            lot. He has served 40 years in active duty, Air Force Reserves, and Air
                            National Guard. He moved to New York and married; while in New York he
                            held multiple jobs and considers New York more his home than Baltimore.
                            He has two boys. Jim explains that the Air National Guard is a part-time
                            military career. He was part of their Critical Incident Stress
                            Management (CISM) team, and they were deployed to the disaster site on
                            September 11th to work with the Air Guard and help them deal with the
                            stress and pain of being at the site. Most National Guard members are
                            young people 18 – 25 years old who join for education and training. They
                            were not prepared to be engaged in a situation like 9/11. “For all
                            intents and purposes, they were civilians.” The CISM team’s duty is what
                            Jim calls “a talking process – private or in groups” that is voluntary
                            for the Air Guardsmen. Anyone who wanted to come and talk had the
                            opportunity to do so. They would speak to the team about what they were
                            going through and although the team is not made up of trained
                            psychologists, this is the “first level opportunity” for the soldiers to
                            speak about their feelings. If CISM felt it was necessary, they would
                            refer to psychologists or recommend a transfer for the person. Jim
                            recalls a large percentage of personnel not wanting to talk – they were
                            seeing things they had never seen in their lives, “bodies, buildings
                            crashing”. When he arrived himself, seeing whole buildings crumbled
                            reminded him of a World War II movie, “but this was in Manhattan, right
                            here at home.” There was some confusion and concern over the air
                            quality, but they were told it was safe so they didn’t take any
                            precautions. Although it was chaotic, it was clear to Jim what they
                            needed to do, they just needed to find where to do it. The CISM team
                            ended up working out of a few rooms at a local college. The National
                            Guard was there primarily to secure the area and stayed about 6 months,
                            Jim says. CISM was on site for 3 months but continued counseling on
                            bases such as West Point and Stuart Air Force Base. “We were not trained
                            or talked to about our own personal emotional feelings”, it was all
                            about helping others. But they ended up needing help too – this was “a
                            new twist”. The upper ranks felt that the CISM team was removed from the
                            hands-on work and therefore didn’t need help. However, the consequences
                            to the team were just as acute as the workers themselves. “PTSD, COPD -
                            maybe we weren’t affected as emotionally as those who were digging for
                            bodies, but we were affected. It was an unseen consequence.” Jim suffers
                            from COPD as a result of his time at the disaster site. Jim describes
                            some of the reactions of the people CISM was there to help: increased
                            alcohol drinking, being irritated with their families, no appetite. The
                            team would listen with empathy and try to suggest that these were normal
                            reactions to a very abnormal situation. “Not to suggest that it was ok
                            to drink heavily, but that these strange feelings were very normal”.
                            They would try to help the individual reduce their stress and recognize
                            this was indeed a very stressful situation and of course they would have
                            these reactions. “Don’t internalize it, recognize where it’s coming from
                            – it doesn’t make you a bad person.” There was a feeling of relief when
                            Jim’s time at the site ended. He was glad to be away from the stress
                            that he was hearing about. “Not that I didn’t want to help people but it
                            was a relief to be away.” Although, since he lived in Manhattan, the
                            reminder was always there because of the physical location. Situations
                            like these “brings your humanity closer in focus – brings death closer –
                            usually it’s abstract, but it opens a whole different world of how you
                            look at things and appreciate things.” When asked what he would like
                            future generations to remember about the disaster, Jim states that
                            national disasters are going to happen: war, bombing, floods – “I think
                            the message is that generally we get through these things and we
                            survive. The human spirit will survive; survival is not fragile, it is
                            very real and we do survive.”

       Philip grew up in Massapequa, NY. His father was a plumber and beginning
                            at the age 12 he would help his father out after school and on weekends.
                            He started out in plumbing but then became a police officer to satisfy
                            his mother and his Irish heritage. He always kept his union card and
                            after he retired from the police force he returned to plumbing. He has a
                            wife and three sons. On September 11th, he began his daily work ritual
                            which included meeting with coworkers in battery, drinking coffee,
                            feeding the squirrels, and admiring the beautiful day before heading to
                            the 13th floor of the unfinished Ritz Carlton to report for work.
                            Shortly after he got to work, a coworker rushed in to say the World
                            Trade Center was on fire. When Philip looked out the window, he saw the
                            second plane overhead and thought to himself- “This is no regular fire!
                            Oh boy, we are in trouble.” He evacuated the building headed up West
                            Street towards the World Trade Center. A triage center was set up at the
                            Winter Garden Atrium for those who made it down the stairs of the
                            towers. A firefighter at the triage mentioned they were running low on
                            oxygen. Philip knew there were some tanks back at the Ritz Carlton used
                            for cutting metal. He ran back to go grab the oxygen tanks just the
                            South tower fell. Philip escaped the dust cloud from each tower as he
                            ran back and forth from the Ritz Carlton grabbing tanks, hard hats,
                            cutting tools, and masks. He immediately began to help and at some point
                            throughout the course of the day he squeezed in a phone call with his
                            wife. She let him know their neighbor was in one of the towers and no
                            one has heard from him yet. When asked about the air quality, Philip
                            said he fortunately missed the dust clouds, but there were odd smells
                            and fires- “We knew it was dangerous. Dust is not good for you. In
                            construction, dust is a problem.” This was two towers worth of dust. The
                            collapsing towers were hard for many of his coworkers. Most of them left
                            and found odd routes to head back home. But as a former police officer,
                            Philp had seen a lot more than his coworkers. He was used to approaching
                            a scene and making quick decisions to help others. He spent three days
                            working with fire fighters on the South Bridge with a torch in his hand
                            waiting for someone to request his help. He occasionally asked about his
                            neighbor- had any one at the site seen him or heard from him? On the
                            third day, iron workers arrived at the site and he saw an opportunity to
                            head home, catching a ride with a police officer headed to Long Island.
                            At home, he discovered his neighbor was still missing. All the
                            neighbor’s relatives were at the house waiting, like a big wake. He
                            immediately grabbed some red, white, and blue Christmas lights and hung
                            them up outside along with a flag. The neighbor’s family thanked him. He
                            still has these lights hanging, waiting for the next disaster. Since
                            9/11, Philip has become more watchful and alert. He advises others to be
                            more aware of what is going on around the world and believes something
                            has got to be done about the issues in the Middle East and, more
                            recently, with ISIS. His solution is to go back to the Roosevelt days.
                            “Speak softly and carry a big stick, be proactive before it is too late,
                            and handle it before it is an issue.”

       Ray grew up in the Bronx, on Eagle Avenue. He attended high school in the
                            south Bronx, saying it was a lot of fun with a lot of different
                            nationalities. He has four brothers and one sister and is the baby of
                            the family. Ray worked around automotive equipment all his life and
                            progressed to heavy equipment. Ray moved to White Plains, New York after
                            high school, and the father of a girl he was dating owned a gas station
                            so he started working there. He met his wife after he was self-employed
                            and owned several ‘rigs’. They married in 1972 and they have two
                            children. After working for Penn Central (now called Metro North) for 12
                            years, he went to the Transit Authority. On September 11th, Ray was a
                            superintendent in the Heavy Equipment Department with the Transit
                            Authority. He was working in the Brooklyn shop when he heard the plane
                            had crashed into the towers. Some people working in the upper yard had
                            seen the crash. All their equipment was assembled at the Atlantic Street
                            yard, and it was a five mile long convoy. They took all the equipment to
                            the Trade Center (cranes, etc.) and it was difficult keeping the convoy
                            together. There were approximately 70 men reporting to the site, and
                            none of them knew what to think; they just knew they had to get there to
                            help. When they finally arrived, it was total chaos. Dump trucks were
                            lining the streets, 40 on each side, it was “hard to believe”. People
                            were walking, covered in dust. They could see desks and file cabinets
                            hanging; it was sad and unexplainable. “We were there to clean up” –
                            they brought front loaders, flat beds, fork lifts, dump trucks. To get
                            into the area they were ordered to crush police cars, unmarked cars,
                            “just get them out of the way.” Ray couldn’t put it all together; he saw
                            boots, scud packs – “Where did they all go? They disintegrated. So,
                            where are they? In Heaven, that’s where.” It started to hit him that
                            there had been bodies in all those boots and scud packs, and he began to
                            cry. Ray went home that night in a transit truck so he could get back in
                            the next day. His wife was panicky, but he went back to work around 5am;
                            he got “just a little break” because we “have to help when we’re needed,
                            gotta do what you gotta do.” That next day there was less chaos, and
                            more control. His job was to make sure all the men were placed in time –
                            who’s coming and going, who’s hurt, “keeping track of everyone”. He had
                            to make sure there was fuel, and that all the equipment was up and
                            running. Where each truck was, where it was going – “then the paperwork
                            starts.” Ray recalls finding a desk ornament, a golf putter, and
                            thinking, “This was on someone’s desk…man, what I am doing on this pile?
                            This is your job, just do it!” He also remembers seeing piles of brand
                            new work boots and socks, so much food: one guy with 15 pizza pies and
                            soda, so many people coming together. “I hope we stay this way for a
                            long time – it was like the sky opened up and rained down all these
                            helpers.” Ray and his men stayed there 5 days until the contractors
                            came. He felt like the contractors were like wolves; “It was greed,
                            money…we’re already here, why do we have to leave?” But once they did
                            leave, they went back to their regular routine. Ray now has prostate
                            cancer, and has no family history of cancer. Ironically, the surgery to
                            remove his prostate was on September 11th, the doctor told him no one
                            ever wants to have surgery on that day. But Ray said, “I’ll take it!” so
                            he will never forget it; he remembers every day and hopes that nothing
                            else comes up. His wife worries, and “looks at me like – are you
                            breathing ok?!” Ray states that he hopes nothing like this ever happens
                            again. He wants everyone to remember that the transit workers were
                            there, “I’m proud of us! Best ride, biggest system in the world!” When
                            asked to make a final statement, Ray says, “Stick together as one, help
                            one another and nothing like this will break us apart.”

       Joseph Pironti comes from a close Italian family. He has three children
                            and is married to his second wife. He has been an auto mechanic for most
                            of his life and owned a shop for 20 years. On 9/11 he was going through
                            a divorce and was living in a studio apartment in Dix Hills, and his
                            children were young. He was asked to work for an environmental cleaning
                            company because he had the mechanical expertise to maintain the
                            equipment and welding skills needed for the dismantling of the wreckage
                            at Ground Zero. Joseph is no longer able to work because ten years after
                            the attacks, he became ill. He was diagnosed with Chronic Lymphocytic
                            Leukemia. He lives his life in chronic pain and the abnormal white blood
                            cells accumulate in his lymph nodes and joints. His wife takes care of
                            him, so it has affected them financially because they cannot work as
                            much. Joseph arrived at Ground Zero a few days after the attacks and
                            stayed in Manhattan in a hotel because he worked 6 days a week/twelve
                            hours a day until January 2002. He described in detail of the whole
                            operation of how the steel columns are broken up and dismantled by
                            cranes and welders, then towed away on a flatbed truck to the barge that
                            brought the debris to Staten Island. Seven huge truck washes were set up
                            to decontaminate the trucks before they drove away with the rubble. Most
                            workers were dressed in a hazmat suits, but he only wore coveralls to
                            power wash the trucks to remove the remaining hot ciders and dust.
                            Joseph also spoke of how respectful the workers were when a body part
                            was found. If it was NYPD or FDNY, an American flag would be draped on
                            the gurney and everyone would take time to pay their last respect. This
                            would occur ten to twenty times a day. Joseph praised the Salvation Army
                            for their wondrous efforts. He said he has so much respect for them now
                            that he never did before. Their volunteers from all over the country
                            were there to serve food, to get clothing or supplies and to just sit
                            and listen to the workers would express their feelings. The Salvation
                            Army also had letters from children from everywhere expressing their
                            gratitude and love for the First Responders, which was especially
                            heart-warming to Joseph. Joseph believes that if the WTC workers had
                            evacuated immediately, we wouldn’t have had so many perish. He also
                            wishes that he had been fitted and worn a respirator, but since he
                            wasn’t working directly on the pile, he was told it wasn’t necessary.
                            Dust was everywhere and was several inches thick. He was able to take
                            hundreds of tasteful pictures that displayed the magnitude of how many
                            structures were affected. He brought them in to share with us and use
                            for documentation if we choose to. Joseph had the opportunity to meet
                            several celebrities and sports stars that visited Ground Zero. He also
                            was served dinner by Rudy Giuliani on Christmas Day, which was posted in
                            the LI Newsday, which he brought in for us to see and keep if we wanted.
                            Joseph now understands why the WWII Veterans were unable to talk about
                            the horrific experiences of war. He feels that Veterans are real heroes
                            because they volunteered to be shot at, whereas, most First Responders
                            were doing their daily job. However, he feels as an American citizen,
                            everyone should volunteer to serve their country. He helped out his
                            neighbors in the aftermath of Super Storm Sandy and his wife was a
                            volunteer EMT. He would do it all over again if needed, even though his
                            efforts left him with a chronic terminal disease.

       James was born in Flushing and currently lives in East Meadow, Long
                            Island. He works for NYC Department of Sanitation. On September 11th,
                            James was assigned to operate the truck called Easy Pack. They started
                            picking up cans with the forks of the truck, and heard a crash – James
                            thought he dropped the container. Then his partner pointed out the smoke
                            and flames. They kept working, and heard a larger explosion – they
                            thought it was time to get the hell out! Cars were abandoned, they saw
                            the Fire and Police departments coming in droves. James remembers with
                            vivid detail the people he saw hanging out of the windows and jumping.
                            No one knew what was going on, no one knew what to do; it was like
                            everything was going in slow motion and people were in shock. They got
                            into their truck, rammed some cars out of the way and got out of there.
                            They drove on roads they normally would be allowed on, and managed to
                            get under the overpasses. The smell of burning metal was very bad, and
                            the smoke was bad. About a week later they were organized to go in, and
                            anyone front loader qualified got called din to run the heavy equipment.
                            They sifted through all the debris in Building 7, which was drug
                            evidence, and then began on building removal. James states it looked
                            like a war zone, but all the people were very friendly and everyone was
                            giving away food. It was depressing for James to be there for his 12
                            hour shifts; the chaos and feeling of being in a war zone was crazy. No
                            one had masks; when they were finally issued masks with canisters, no
                            one had filter refills. James now has a sinus condition and is a patient
                            at the Mineola clinic of the World Trade Center Monitoring Program where
                            they are trying to figure out his health issues. “I worked at all the
                            ‘places of interest’” – Manhattan, at the landfill, on the pile – “and
                            saw all sorts of guys with equipment – why don’t I have any of that
                            equipment?” James wanted the city to get back to normal and let the
                            terrorists know that they didn’t win. He is proud of the fact that he
                            helped; “I don’t want anything for it, the guys running towards the
                            buildings should get all the credit.” To future generations, James says
                            he hops they are in a lot better state that we are in today. “Seems like
                            religion is always the root of the problems, and I hope they are all
                            past this by then and see how stupid it all is.” He hopes people will
                            remember, there could be peace but he doesn’t see that coming. “I can’t
                            describe the devastation well enough – this was BAD – and it wasn’t that
                            long ago.”

       Michael was born in Queens and moved to Long Island after being with the
                            NYPD for one year. He currently lives in Massapequa on the south shore
                            of Long Island, and has been there for 16 years. He is married and has
                            two daughters, ages 12 and 14. Michael worked 20 years with the NYPD,
                            and retired as the Operation Coordinator of the Detective Bureau. He
                            really enjoyed his time with the police department, and when he retired
                            his career path was not over; currently he is the Director of Security
                            for a private security company. On September 11th, he was the Robbery
                            Sergeant in Queens. He heard about the attacks as he was driving with
                            his one year old daughter strapped into her car seat, listening to the
                            traffic report on the radio. The reporter was saying a plane had hit the
                            World Trade Center. There were big changes to the report as he drove
                            from Long Island to New York City. He knew it was a terror attack, and
                            kind of froze – is this real? He was now approaching Queens in a panic,
                            he knew it was going to be one hell of a day. He dropped his daughter to
                            his mother-in-laws house, “Ma, put on the TV I have no idea when I will
                            be home!” Michael’s wife is a CPA and her office was in the WTC. That
                            day she was in training down south; she hadn’t wanted to go to the
                            training because she felt the baby was too young and it was a last
                            minute decision that she would go. She would have been there, and that
                            morning Mike was thinking Oh My God, she would have been at work right
                            now. It was surreal to see the smoke, again thinking, “Is this really
                            happening?!” What was running through his mind was, “OK, you’re NYPD,
                            you have a job to do, go do it.” Once he got to the 110th precinct, the
                            Citiwide radio was on and there was an overwhelming feeling of
                            helplessness. Hearing cops, their brothers and sisters, screaming
                            “10-13, 10-13”, the code for ‘I need immediate help’ – “It felt like we
                            were listening to them take their last breath and there’s nothing we can
                            do to help them.” Then, Mike experienced crushing chest pain and
                            collapsed. They took him to the hospital, but he thought he shouldn’t be
                            there - they would be flooded with patients soon. He was sedated and
                            discharged, and was cleared to go back to work the next day. It still
                            bothers him to this day, no matter how much he talks about it, that he
                            didn’t respond with his men that first day. They worked 12 hour shifts
                            in the landfill and had to create death notifications. He and another
                            detective would have to notify the families that remains had been
                            identified as their loved ones. He will never forget the smell; the
                            enormity of the event hit him as he saw the barges come filled with
                            debris and human remains. The dump trucks would empty and backhoes would
                            spread the debris. It was hot and sometimes still on fire, they would
                            have to wait for it to cool off. Mike describes rebar bent in all
                            different directions, dust that was more like thick sandy dirt in the
                            air, and the distress of finding personal belongings. Mike says that
                            cops develop ‘tunnel vision’ to be able to perform their jobs and focus
                            on what they’re doing: raking through the debris looking for human
                            remains, which would be put into a bucket. “Horrible, terrible, I found
                            a piece of scalp: perfectly parted silver hair.” This impacted him, but
                            it was also part of the routine. “My faith in God was shaken. How does
                            God allow something like this to happen?” One day, a dim and dismal day
                            at the landfill, Mike saw a Catholic priest walking towards him out of
                            the corner of his eye. He was handing out little green New Testament
                            Bibles. The priest said, “Would you pray with me?” and Mike thought –
                            here comes this priest out of NOWHERE and says will you pray with me, is
                            this a message? “A reminder that God is still here, to know that He knew
                            what was going on with me, a message specifically to me – Michael, I
                            know what’s going on with you and I’m still here with you.” There were
                            meal tents for the responders to take a break and eat their meals, but
                            Mike remembers thinking, how can I eat in this place? Supply trucks
                            finally came with canister masks, but this was after they had been told
                            the air was fine – “Obviously it was not.” Mike goes on to say that in
                            his opinion, 9/11 is still happening today, “even right here in this
                            clinic” because although so many died at the event, so many are dying
                            subsequently, and so may responders are being diagnosed with aggressive
                            cancers. A friend of his was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, “I just saw
                            him at a school function and now all of a sudden he has stage 4?! The
                            cancer took him in six months.” Mike has been suffering from PTSD for
                            many years now and has flashbacks and nightmares. NYPD put him on
                            restricted duty and sent him for a psychological evaluation. He says he
                            still feels guilty, feels that he didn’t do enough. But he states there
                            is a tremendous amount of support available to responders if you seek it
                            out. On the heels of this thought, Mike recalls one family he notified
                            of their loved ones death “just collapsed – they KNEW, but this was the
                            confirmation. They wanted to know which piece was found.” Mike says he
                            was in a very dark place and knew he needed help. He thinks it’s funny
                            that he can sit here now, so many years later, and still see “frame by
                            frame” what happened that day. When asked what he would like future
                            generations to take away from the event and his interview, Mike states
                            that the responders were all human beings. Despite the overwhelming
                            event, the first responders did their jobs – they ran to the site as
                            everyone else ran away; remember the human aspect: the courage, resolve,
                            commitment and selflessness. “That we have a job to do and we won’t stop
                            doing it.” Never forget; he feels that history will write it and it will
                            never be forgotten, but he would ask that people take the time to read
                            it not as a history lesson – “pause and reflect, think of the people,
                            the human aspect, the families.”

       James is from Ronkonkoma, where he has always lived. When he was growing
                            up, many people in his community were fire or police department. James
                            didn’t have money for college, so he took the NYPD entrance exam and was
                            hire; he became a homicide detective in 1996. James has several
                            children, one of whom is a junior firefighter with a local department.
                            He wants to be a career firefighter. His family history is
                            interesting—very long line of people in service. The week before 9/11,
                            James had been promoted into a special robbery task force. That morning,
                            he was late to work and heard of the first place crash on the radio—from
                            where he was in his car, he could see a little black mark on the tower.
                            He raced to his precinct, where the lieutenant, who had come in early,
                            prevented the officers from rushing down to the WTC, likely saving their
                            lives. Eventually, he reported to help people across the Brooklyn Bridge
                            and ultimately ended up down at the site. He recalls the “dead,
                            disgusting silence” and not knowing where to begin. James got himself on
                            work rosters and kept returning to the site until Saturday, when orders
                            came down and he was sent to the morgue. The PD wanted their detectives
                            doing detective work, not digging on the pile. James remembered being at
                            the landfill and thinking he had found human remains—but they turned out
                            to be raw chicken from Windows on the World. He remembers finding some
                            bones, shoes, and lots of IDS—he never looked at the names on them. He
                            thinks now of hos stupid it was for the responders to stand around
                            eating free food in the middle of a toxic wasteland. James does feel
                            that the higher-ups tried to “make chicken salad out of chicken shit”
                            when finding remains of first responders; he just wanted to make sure
                            they got the respects they were due. James was a robot during that time,
                            and began drinking to excess to cope with PTSD. He was diagnosed with
                            stage 4 Hodgkin’s in June 2010 and went through chemo and radiation,
                            which ruined his thyroid and precipitated the onset of panic attacks.
                            The combination of prescription anti-anxiety meds and alcohol
                            necessitated his entry into rehab, where he was for 30 days. He checked
                            out on 9/11 of 2013. He is currently in cancer remission, but has many
                            friends who have died. James spoke about the ways in which this has
                            affected his family, his thoughts on post-9/11 politics, and more recent
                            events. He does believe there have been positives to come out of it, but
                            that people are generally more concerned about the cost of gas and war
                            than that people are still dying. He hopes people in the future
                            understand the gravity of 9/11.

       As a third generation police officer, John was proud to wear the same
                            shield number as his father and grandfather before him. He didn’t plan
                            on becoming a police officer but after taking the exam he left St.
                            John’s University where he was studying computer science. After 7 years
                            as a police officer he got married and currently has a 20 year old son
                            and a 17 year old daughter. John, a Detective Sargent, was at work the
                            morning of 9/11 when he received a call from the Bureau of Manhattan
                            requesting his team and him make it to the 1st Precinct, just past Canal
                            Street, because a plane flew into the World Trade Center. When he turned
                            on the TV he thought “it didn’t look that bad, it must have been a small
                            plane.” His team of eleven piled into three unmarked cars. When they got
                            the 1st Precinct, John asked them to remain in the cars as he checked
                            in. John found the building empty because the meeting location was
                            changed to the south side near Battery Park. When he got back to the
                            cars, he found some members of his team arguing before a distress call
                            came in over the radio. The call was asking for someone to call the
                            Pentagon because there is a second plane and we’re under attack. John
                            was in the lead car, approaching the WTC as they headed to the south
                            side, when they saw swarms of people running away. He looked over the
                            dashboard, up at the building tops, and saw what looked like glitter
                            (windows) and toothpicks (steel beams) followed by a massive a cloud of
                            dust as the building was beginning to collapse. Fortunately, the
                            detectives in the cars following him realized and were already gone. The
                            driver backed up the car trying to escape the cloud before it engulfed
                            the car. Once they were safe, John found out the detectives were arguing
                            earlier over who was going to drive. Someone in the back seat was
                            complaining the driver was too slow and he thought they should switch.
                            They didn’t switch before John came out the 1st Precinct. But John can’t
                            help but think, had the two switched they would have made it much closer
                            to the buildings and things would have worked out drastically different.
                            This was by far the closest he had ever been to being killed even when
                            compared to a shootout he was involved with several years back. He says
                            “it’s odd when you think of all the things that happened that could have
                            changed…all the ‘what ifs.’” John and his team were stationed at St.
                            Luke’s hospital for a while and then they made their way to the pile. He
                            remembers hearing the chips from the fire fighters PASS devices and
                            seeing an unbelievable amount of paper. Everything else was
                            unrecognizable. He compared the bucket brigade to taking a bucket of
                            water out of the ocean, but something needed to be done. John continued
                            to describe the system used at the Fresh Kills landfill. At first there
                            was nothing there, but as government and civilian agencies joined
                            together housing was built, port-a-potties, and supplies arrived. Barges
                            would bring over the debris from lower Manhattan and a crane would fill
                            a dump truck. The dump truck would spread the debris across designated
                            football sized field where 20-30 detectives would search through looking
                            for body parts, personal items, and the black boxes from the planes.
                            After this search a bulldozer would push aside the larger pieces and
                            collect the smaller materials. The smaller materials were brought to a
                            sifter which would remove anything smaller than a softball. These
                            materials were then placed on a conveyer belt and searched through one
                            final time. Out of the eleven detectives John supervised, seven have
                            severe health issues, one of which has passed. He says 9/11 is a distant
                            memory for most but the general public doesn’t realize how sick people
                            really are because of their exposure on 9/11 and in the clean-up. He
                            believes 9/11 woke the nation up from the horrible things going on in
                            other parts of the word but we are going back. He hopes that from his
                            story people can learn from the 9/11 and other events going on around
                            the world to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Also, remember those who
                            died heading to work and going on with their daily lives. It could have
                            been anyone.

       Joe grew up in Brooklyn. He took the Police and Fire tests when his
                            friend Mark got into the NYPD – that made him go for it. His married to
                            his wife Kelly for 20 years and has two children. They moved to Long
                            Island ten years ago, and he is currently an active duty Detective
                            working with COMSTAT data bases at One Police Plaza. On the morning of
                            September 11th, Joe was working at the Brooklyn South Task Force. It was
                            a beautiful crisp morning. They saw on the television that a plane had
                            hit the towers and the Commanding Officer came in and said – suit up,
                            we’re going to go in. Citiwide One was on the radio and they heard
                            another plane hit, “Holy shit, what’s happening?” Joe said the towers
                            looked like two candles burning as they approached. It was very quiet in
                            the van, which was very unlike them. They were diverted en route by
                            someone directing traffic. They heard what they thought was another
                            plane hitting, but it was the first tower crumbling. They were only two
                            blocks away, and they got out of the vans and ran. Joe couldn’t find
                            anyone from this unit – the radios were not working, cell phone were not
                            working. There was four to five inches of ash on the ground around him.
                            He couldn’t get in touch with anyone until he hear the Tribeca Hotel had
                            a land line and then he was finally able to get in touch with his wife.
                            Because his unit had not gone to their original rendezvous location,
                            their dispatcher thought that all of Brooklyn South’s day tour was dead.
                            If they hadn’t been diverted by that random man, they would have been
                            crushed by the falling building. When he finally called his wife, he got
                            goose bumps because she thought he was dead. The site looked like a
                            nuclear holocaust, like something from a Hollywood movie. It was unreal,
                            and Joe said he felt numb – “Totally numb.” It didn’t really hit him
                            until he got home – he lived close to the city so he had a two hour
                            window where he was able to go home – he watched it on the television
                            and saw the plane hit for the first time. His wife and kids were waiting
                            for him – he couldn’t wait to get home and hug his family, “How many
                            people would never be going home?” He doesn’t recall speaking to Kelly
                            about it, but a couple of days after a group of elementary kids came to
                            sing for them and call them heroes. “The ones who died were the heroes,
                            I was just a police officer doing my job.” Joe has vivid recollections
                            for the dust, rubble and fear of the unknown. He remembers hearing
                            Officer Kelly’s final transition on Citiwide One. People “thought they
                            (the cops) could do no wrong. Everyone was proud to be an American, it
                            was not a black/white issue, and finally everyone was just an American.”
                            There was a tremendous amount of patriotism. Joe is bothered that his
                            daughters High School only had a moment of silence in observance of 9/11
                            and nothing else. It bothers him that she isn’t taught. When asked what
                            he would like future generations to remember, Joe says, “Just never
                            forget.”

       Arturo grew up in the Patterson projects in the South Bronx. Had a great
                            childhood. He has an older sister. Arturo and his sister are very close.
                            He was raised in a Hispanic household. Arturo’s father was a custodian
                            and his mom worked at the Cardinal Hayes High School. Her job was to
                            take care of the priests. After high school, Arturo got drafted to play
                            basketball. He first went to the New York City Community College and
                            then he transferred to the Connecticut College for Women. He was one of
                            twenty-five men in an all-girl school. Arturo was an early childhood
                            development major. He began his career by teaching kindergarten. After
                            he graduated the Connecticut College for Women, Arturo received a
                            scholarship to attend the George Williams College and then later went to
                            earn a doctorate at the University of Maryland. Arturo loves to learn
                            and would go back to school in a heartbeat if he had the chance. When he
                            left the University of Maryland he worked at the Wild Cliff Children’s
                            Museum as an interpreter. After this work experience, Arturo went to
                            work for the Catholic school system. He taught first and sixth grade
                            then eighth grade. He later made the jump to high school. On 9/11 he was
                            teaching at the Sacred Heart High School in Yonkers. From the parking
                            lot at the high school there was an unobstructed view of the World Trade
                            Center. He saw the second plane hit. Many of the students’ parents
                            worked at the World Trade. Arturo discusses a story about his niece’s
                            two friends. His niece’s two friends worked at the World Trade Center.
                            They were in the second building that got hit by the second plane. After
                            the first plane hit the tower they called their parents on the phone and
                            their conversation ended abruptly due to the second tower being hit by
                            the other plane. At first, schools didn’t know what to do. After two
                            days the school sent in clinicians. Parents ran in to get their kids
                            out. Most schools shut down for a couple of days in order to get a
                            support system ready for the students. Everyone went to the gym and
                            listened to a priest. Arturo was a chaplain who assisted with disasters.
                            Priests began to do confessions. The school followed through the ritual
                            of the Catholic Church. Arturo believes that the best form of healing
                            was by the students forming peer groups. One student couldn’t get into
                            contact with his father for four to five days. It turned out that the
                            father was in the hospital and suffered severe burns from the events of
                            9/11. Arturo worked at the armory and then the pier. There was a gunboat
                            that took people to the 9/11 site to see the devastation. They did this
                            in order for family members to understand the tragedy. Anthropologists
                            analyzed the human remains. Arturo went to the site on the first day
                            after school with Red Cross. The Family Assistance Shelter provided
                            people with comfort. Celebrities went there to comfort kids. Disney
                            donated stuffed animals. As a chaplain Arturo debriefed police officers
                            and firemen. In addition, not only did chaplains debrief police officers
                            and firemen, but they also debriefed themselves after their shifts.
                            Arturo first worked at the Family Assistance Shelter then worked at the
                            morgue. Only worked there a month because he couldn’t handle the scene
                            at the morgue. When Arturo worked at the pier his car had to be searched
                            by police officers. Many police officers at the time were former
                            students of Arturo’s. He discussed how sometimes after their shifts
                            ended they would meet with Arturo to clear their minds. Many of the
                            police cadets weren’t ready for the chaotic events of 9/11 and left the
                            police force. Shifts at the Family Assistance area were twenty-four/
                            seven. There were different types of religious chaplains in order to
                            accommodate everyone who came in that needed relief. The kids were being
                            entertained at the family center while their parents were consulting
                            with workers. Arturo worked with the Salvation Army and other groups.
                            This helped the workers bond with one another. Trinity Church severed as
                            a hospice for firefighters, police officers and others while they were
                            working. There were podiatrists, and massage therapists to help these
                            workers relax. Firehouses began preparing food. Arturo was part of the
                            Red Cross and a member of a disaster response team. While working at the
                            site, Arturo had to keep the clothes he was wearing outside of the house
                            because the clothes had to be washed separately. At Trinity Church, they
                            had little wooden vases that were filled with the soil from the World
                            Trade and these vases were presented to family members. Arturo went down
                            to the morgue on First Avenue. There were fifteen to twenty trailers of
                            unknown personal belongings. Family members and friends brought down
                            photos of items. One of Arturo’s sons also volunteered to help at the
                            hospice. When Arturo returned to the school system after a month at the
                            site he noticed that the students began forming peer groups that met in
                            the cafeteria or the gymnasium before and during school to help cope
                            with the events of 9/11. Students became closer with one another. Today,
                            Arturo’s school discusses the events of September eleventh on every
                            9/11. After 9/11, Arturo discusses how priests and ministers began to
                            leave the church. Those who left began to question why God let this
                            tragic event occur. Arturo was part of thirteen disaster deployments
                            with the Red Cross. He helped run a food drive on Thanksgiving. Arturo’s
                            primary focus is to help community members. He assisted in setting-up
                            food kitchens, buses, housing and made sure shelters were properly in
                            order. Arturo would like everyone to acknowledge that people from all
                            different backgrounds came together to support others that were in need.

       Tara Bianco is a retired NYPD Officer who began her career as a single
                            mother of two daughters in January 1982. Her father was also a police
                            officer in Nassau County, which is where she grew up and went to private
                            schools. She went to college for Social Work, but life brought her in a
                            different direction. She chose to join the NYPD for the security and
                            benefits and also because she wanted to help people. Tara’s first
                            patrols were in Queens at the 110th, 114th and 115th Precincts as a
                            “Beat Cop” and would eventually be assigned to a Community Affairs task
                            force. She worked closely with the community, forming Neighborhood
                            Watches, and was their liaison to the cops. She was the Captain’s right
                            hand person and had an office in the precinct. On the morning of 9/11,
                            Tara was home. She received a phone call from her friend who told her
                            that “America was under attack”. Tara was in disbelief but then she got
                            the orders to report to work. She packed an overnight bag and drove on
                            the shoulder of the Southern State Parkway all the way to Queens. She
                            made it to the precinct by 11:00 am, and when she arrived, it was just
                            chaos because no one knew anything. It was all so surreal for her and
                            all of the officers kept their eye on the TV for updates. Finally, her
                            Captain briefed them after a meeting he had just attended, and his first
                            statement was, “A lot of people have died.” Tara’s first assignment was
                            to evacuate families from the buildings adjacent to Ground Zero. There
                            were many families who stayed in their homes despite the mounds of dust
                            that had accumulated everywhere. The dust was mixed with water so
                            everyone was walking around in grey sludge. Families didn’t know where
                            to go and fear had kept them inside because their homes were their “safe
                            place”. There were many animals left behind too. NYPD and the Red Cross
                            worked together to find temporary housing and transport families to
                            shelters. After a week, when officials changed the efforts from rescue
                            to recovery, Mayor Giuliani formed a Task Force that would try to give
                            the victim’s families closure. At Pier 94, loved ones would be able to
                            drop off toothbrushes for DNA evidence to help identify the remains. The
                            Task Force was a “Mental Health Team” which included NYPD, NYS Troopers,
                            EMT’s, Clergy, petting dogs, psychologists and volunteers from families
                            of the Oklahoma Bombings. The ferry would bring the families over to
                            Ground Zero three times a day in an effort to try to give them closure.
                            An observation deck was built especially for the families to view the
                            site. Tara would escort them and be there for emotional support. Donated
                            flowers and stuffed animals were available for the families to leave at
                            a designated memorial wall. Afterwards, Tara would present the families
                            with an urn and a folded US flag on behalf of NYC the Mayor. Tara did
                            many things to help her cope through the six weeks that she worked on
                            this Task Force. She would keep a journal for a few weeks and sought
                            psychotherapy immediately. NYPD would also be “debriefed” daily. Tara
                            did feel like she fell into a “black hole” of depression. She had a good
                            support system with her fellow officers and family, especially her
                            father, who is very proud of her. Tara now has a tunnel and bridge
                            phobia and frequently has anxiety and doesn’t feel “safe”. Despite all
                            of this, Tara loved her job because she liked helping people, and feels
                            she did a job that she can be proud of. She is now saddened because she
                            feels that 9/11 has been forgotten, and history tends to repeat itself,
                            so she wants everyone to stay vigilant. She is still a hopeful person,
                            and truly believes that the U.S. is the greatest country in the world.

       Anthony grew up in Canarsie, Brooklyn NY. Growing up, he was 1 of 6 kids,
                            2 brothers and 3 sisters. Both of his brothers are both retired FDNY
                            firemen and one of his sisters is a New York State Trooper. Anthony’s
                            father was a retired lieutenant FDNY and his mom was a stay at home mom.
                            Anthony dropped out of school in the 10th grade and his father got him a
                            job with the fire department. He thought about opening up a pizzeria but
                            decided to become a cop after his brother-in-law was killed when an
                            undercover operation went bad when he was a State Trooper. Anthony
                            started working in the Narcotics division and met his wife, who is a
                            court officer, at a nightclub on Long Island while working undercover
                            from 1994-2002. On the morning of 9/11, Anthony was opening up a tattoo
                            shop in Copiague, NY when the news rang out that the planes hit the
                            towers. After 9/11 Newsday (Long Island Newspaper) did a write up on the
                            tattoo shop which helped them stay in business, dealing a lot with the
                            responder clientele. Anthony describes what he was witnessing once he
                            got into Manhattan, being a part of narcotics they just stood around for
                            a while because they’ve never dealt with anything like this type of
                            situation before. He also ran into a neighbor from Long Island that told
                            him both of his brothers that were FDNY firemen were okay, which was a
                            huge relief for him. Anthony stated that the destruction was
                            unbelievable and they didn’t know what the effects would be after the
                            fall out, they were given little paper masks. He was a smoker and even
                            though a few individuals were warning them about the smoke coming up
                            from the Pile, they didn’t think that 10-15 years down the road people
                            would be dealing with the effects of that stuff. He was upset that no
                            one told them what could happen to them after they were done with the
                            clean-up. Especially seeing friends die from 9/11 related cancers; “but
                            those people shouldn’t have to expect to get sick over the actions of…
                            some politics.” Anthony deals with the guilt of still being alive and
                            having a healthy family when there were moms and dads that died in 9/11.
                            Initially, he spent a lot of time at the site (a couple of weeks) and
                            then got bussed to Freshkills Landfill to sift through piles brought in
                            from Ground Zero looking for human remains. He can’t garden his own
                            house without having those memories brought back up. Once retired,
                            Anthony thought that he would start to feel better. Not realizing that
                            the worst was yet to come. Being at home and not being a cop was
                            something he hasn’t thought about for 20 years and the PTSD hit him hard
                            after retirement. He mentions how he understands how drinking has always
                            been a lifeline for cops to self-medicate. He discusses deep depression
                            and how he understands why people commit suicide. Trying to get away
                            from all the noise and light that’s bringing back all these memories.
                            Anthony speaks openly about his mental health, being on medication and
                            how therapy helped transform his life post 9/11. He wants people to take
                            care of each other and their mental health. Take the sigma out of mental
                            health issues and being a cop and making it okay, giving them help for
                            PTSD. In 50 years from now, he hopes that people learn compassion for
                            each other. Help those who need helping and who need money.

       On the morning of 9/11, Anthony was opening up a tattoo shop in Copiague,
                            NY when the news rang out that the planes hit the towers. After 9/11
                            Newsday (Long Island Newspaper) did a write up on the tattoo shop which
                            helped them stay in business, dealing a lot with the responder
                            clientele. Anthony describes what he was witnessing once he got into
                            Manhattan, being a part of narcotics they just stood around for a while
                            because they’ve never dealt with anything like this type of situation
                            before. He also ran into a neighbor from Long Island that told him both
                            of his brothers that were FDNY firemen were okay, which was a huge
                            relief for him. Anthony stated that the destruction was unbelievable and
                            they didn’t know what the effects would be after the fall out, they were
                            given little paper masks. He was a smoker and even though a few
                            individuals were warning them about the smoke coming up from the Pile,
                            they didn’t think that 10-15 years down the road people would be dealing
                            with the effects of that stuff. He was upset that no one told them what
                            could happen to them after they were done with the clean-up. Especially
                            seeing friends die from 9/11 related cancers; “but those people
                            shouldn’t have to expect to get sick over the actions of… some
                            politics.”

       Anthony deals with the guilt of still being alive and having a healthy
                            family when there were moms and dads that died in 9/11. Initially, he
                            spent a lot of time at the site (a couple of weeks) and then got bussed
                            to Freshkills Landfill to sift through piles brought in from Ground Zero
                            looking for human remains. He can’t garden his own house without having
                            those memories brought back up. Once retired, Anthony thought that he
                            would start to feel better. Not realizing that the worst was yet to
                            come. Being at home and not being a cop was something he hasn’t thought
                            about for 20 years and the PTSD hit him hard after retirement. He
                            mentions how he understands how drinking has always been a lifeline for
                            cops to self-medicate. He discusses deep depression and how he
                            understands why people commit suicide. Trying to get away from all the
                            noise and light that’s bringing back all these memories. Anthony speaks
                            openly about his mental health, being on medication and how therapy
                            helped transform his life post 9/11. He wants people to take care of
                            each other and their mental health. Take the sigma out of mental health
                            issues and being a cop and making it okay, giving them help for PTSD. In
                            50 years from now, he hopes that people learn compassion for each other.
                            Help those who need helping and who need money.

       K.C. Rondello oral history

      <p>
       September 11th 2001, was K.C.’s first day as a physician executive at a
                            hospital in Valley Stream, NY. He was expecting the usual first day
                            ritual of paperwork and Human Resources. Nevertheless, was going to be
                            an exciting day at a new job. On his way in he heard about a small plane
                            hitting the World Trade Center broadcast over the radio and by the time
                            he arrived at the hospital, the second plane had hit. He immediately
                            recognized there would be casualties and he joined some colleagues who
                            were headed into Manhattan. K.C. recalls snapshot pictures of the day
                            that bring back the stories. He vividly remembers the choked lanes of
                            traffic headed east with the pillars of black smoke in the skyline
                            behind them. No one was driving west, towards the city. The car ride was
                            silent and fear was his predominant emotion. He thought to himself “what
                            am I running into that thousands are running from?” At the site K.C.
                            felt as though he was looking at the world through a black and white
                            lens. He saw a vending cart and could visualize the cart vendor in
                            mid-transaction before dropping everything and running north. The images
                            he has of the site are like dull paintings of grey ash. K.C. and his
                            colleagues were sent to Chelsea Piers where they set up a triage center.
                            K.C. says it was a surreal experience. He periodically had to leave to
                            take an emotional break but he would be bombarded with the media waiting
                            outside. As the days passed, there were fewer and fewer injuries. It
                            shifted from a rescue effort to a recovery effort, and he was no longer
                            needed. While working at the Piers, he wrote an email to friends and
                            family to let them know he was okay. He signed off the email by saying
                            he knows life will forever be different. Over a decade later, he
                            believes we are still trying to understand these differences. He says
                            something always happens to keep this experience fresh in his memory. He
                            has triggers like the smell of burning fuel. This interview is one of
                            those triggers but K.C. feels it is worth revisiting the experience for
                            documenting his piece of history. K.C.’s experience with September 11th
                            encouraged him to become more involved with disasters around the world.
                            In 2002, K.C. became a member of DMAT (Disaster Medical Assistance
                            Team), a federal organization that restores medical infrastructure after
                            a disaster. He also co-developed a graduate program in Emergency
                            Management at Adelphi University. Since 9/11, he has responded in a
                            number of disasters both nationally and internationally. Through his
                            experience he has noticed that as a whole we are still reactive to
                            disasters, despite the best of intentions to be proactive. He points to
                            Hurricane Sandy as an example. Hurricane Sandy plunged the same area
                            affected by 9/11 into powerlessness. No electric, no gas, and
                            devastation. He says we have learned some lessons but it is clear that
                            there are many more to learn when it comes to disaster response. K.C.
                            says his continuous response in rescue efforts around the world brings
                            closure to his experience with the attacks on September 11th, 2001.
                            Through his work, he regains the positives from the experience and feels
                            a sense of purpose and reward. He recognizes the value of time and wants
                            to make his time count. He concludes his interview by saying “it is easy
                            to look at the magnitude of a crisis of that nature and feel powerless.
                            But you’re not. You are key in bringing things back together and I can’t
                            have a big impact but together we can accomplish seemingly inhuman
                            things. “

       Joe is married with three daughters and one son, ranging in ages from
                            20-32. He was born in Brooklyn and moved to Centereach, Long Island as a
                            child. His father worked at Republic Aviation and his mother was a
                            seamstress; Joe has three brothers. Joe went to community college and
                            then joined the Air Force, but was medically discharged during training
                            due to an adverse reaction to an injection. He returned to college and
                            got a biology degree; after working in pharmaceuticals, he took the
                            civil service exam to become an industrial hygienist and was hired by
                            Health and Safety. In his work, he conducted surveys to determine what
                            harmful substances employees in various fields are exposed to and then
                            make recommendations on what kinds of protective gear they should have.
                            On 9/11, he was on his way to work when he heard about the planes on the
                            radio. Eventually, he was notified to report to the site on Wednesday at
                            5pm at the request of OSHA. Joe recalls seeing people rollerblading
                            around 14th St. as if nothing had happened, but then once near the site,
                            the area looked like the site of a nuclear war. Joe and his colleagues
                            were stationed at a school and took over the fitting and distribution of
                            respirators for responders, which had been disorganized until that time.
                            There were many obstacles: cartridges for the respirators would be
                            donated, but they’d be the wrong size; City hall told them there was no
                            time to do actual fittings, so they hurried along in their tasks; the
                            fire department didn’t want to wear them. He recalls that if the fire
                            chiefs wore them, the rest of the squads would, and that cops tended to
                            be more compliant, but that they couldn’t force anyone to adhere. Joe
                            remembers that a Salvation Army captain asked how he could help—Joe told
                            him they needed more donated respirators, and later he saw an
                            announcement about it on the news. He remarked that when the Salvation
                            Army and Red Cross got together, they made a huge tent that people
                            referred to as the Taj Mahal. Joe showed many young RC volunteers how to
                            do fit check on the masks. He remembers being upset at responders who
                            discarded their masks, or others who would poke a hole in theirs so they
                            could smoke a cigarette while still technically wearing it. There were
                            tensions between NYS Dept. of Labor and OSHA during all this. Joe wasn’t
                            able to get credentials to test for harmful matter until October, but he
                            did eventually take air samples. Some other details: there was a huge
                            rat problem in the area, and Joe remembered one firefighter suggesting
                            that they put GPS on the rats as a means of finding human remains;
                            eventually NYC hotels put up many of the responders, which made things a
                            little easier; he remembers seeing clothes caught in fences. He tried to
                            stay busy because it kept him from having time to think about what was
                            going on. He would find himself looking at the families searching for
                            loved ones and wondering what their last conversation had been. Joe
                            believes that sheltering in place was the wrong decision, and that so
                            many more people could have been saved if not for that. Joe worried
                            about the dangers, especially because he had more knowledge about the
                            environmental hazards; he does have the 9/11 cough and worries about
                            further health issues. Joe still worries about terrorist attacks,
                            especially with recent world events.

       Donny has lived on Long Island his entire life growing up and currently
                            living in the town of West Islip. After graduating college in 1976 he
                            joined the Army as a Military Police officer and was stationed in San
                            Francisco, CA for 2 years and West Berlin, Germany for 2 years. Donny
                            saw East Germany when the Berlin wall was still standing and seeing life
                            behind the Iron Curtain made him thankful to be an American. While he
                            was active for 4 years, reservist for 8 years, he was able to see the
                            world, visiting Jordan and Egypt in 1986. In 1981 he was ready to serve
                            his country by becoming a New York City Police Officer and took the
                            test. Due to his active service in the military, Donny was seen as a
                            desirable candidate and was on the force within a year. Donny was
                            married to his wife while he was still enlisted in the service, when he
                            decided to become an NYPD officer, she wasn’t thrilled about it but
                            since her father was an officer, she supported him and his decision.
                            They have one son together who was born in 1987 who later joined the
                            military, being deployed to Afghanistan twice, fighting the war against
                            terrorism. The day of 9/11, Donny was scheduled to work 8AM-4PM shift,
                            he remembers what a beautiful day it was, not a cloud in the sky. While
                            out on patrol they could hear over the radio that the task force was
                            being mobilized to head downtown. His partner and him drove over to the
                            FDR and looked downtown, they were able to see the entire top of Tower 1
                            on fire. They were called back to the station house where they had
                            emergency operations starting to be set up. While they were all getting
                            ready to head back out, they watched the second plane hit Tower 2 and it
                            was at that moment Donny knew they were under attack. They were sent
                            back over to the FDR were they were tasked on diverting traffic and not
                            allowing anyone downtown. Local news stations set up their mobile
                            vehicles in the intersection they were working on so they were able to
                            go into the vans and watch what was happening downtown and saw the
                            buildings fall. Shortly after Donny remembers an eerie sight, watching
                            thousands of people walking up the FDR in silence, coming from downtown.
                            Some of the people were covered in dust but they were all walking
                            towards the 59th Street Bridge to try and get off Manhattan. They were
                            relieved of their security duty by Highway Patrol and were reassigned to
                            convoy duty, escorting Emergency response equipment from Queens Mid-Town
                            tunnel to downtown. They went back and forth, escorting vehicles, until
                            10-11PM and were told they were being put on 12 hour shifts, AM or PM.
                            For the first 3 days, Donny slept in the city, anywhere he could find.
                            He was assigned to help with the bucket brigade and remembers walking
                            into Ground Zero, they were ankle to calf deep in dust and paper.
                            “Amazon sized rain forest of paper.” They saw no office debris, no
                            chairs, tables, fax machines, everything was crushed and vaporized. They
                            searched the buildings for remains and plane parts, noticing an office
                            door that took off the tops of cars because the force was that strong.
                            Donny was moved over to Morgue detail, having to collect body parts, bag
                            then tag the remains, delivering them to the morgue. He only worked
                            there for 3 days and noticed how the bags continuously got smaller until
                            it would be a bucket with flesh in it. Donny was mad and frustrated
                            during the whole process of 9/11 and the days after. Working at Ground
                            Zero until December of 2001, going back to regular shifts at the
                            prescient. Prior to 9/11 he was living in the bubble like everyone else
                            living a great life and then everything changed. He has become more
                            vigilant, re-enforcing the capabilities of people in the world today.
                            Always expect the unexpected. Police works prepares you for the worst
                            but nothing can prepare you to deal with people vanishing into thin air.
                            As a police officer you put your head down and deal with the feelings
                            later. Though he had a hard time sleeping, Donny is not letting this
                            become his life, it was a part of his life.

       Mike grew up as an only child in Brooklyn. He married and moved to Long
                            Island in 1983. He has four children, two biological and two adopted. He
                            says he enjoyed moving to the suburbs and buying is first lawn mower and
                            being able to have many pets. On September 11th, Mike was at work in the
                            city when his wife told him that a plane had hit the Twin Towers. He
                            recalls traffic was crazy while he was trying to get home, and he looked
                            back and saw that the towers were gone. The next day Mike reported to
                            work, but the job site was shut down. He felt that he had to go and help
                            at the disaster site, and a few of them took a golf cart down to see
                            what they could do. He describes the heart wrenching debris littering
                            Vesey Street – wallets and personal items which they gathered and gave
                            to the police. The site was still being doused with water and there was
                            smoke everywhere. He stayed until 7:00 that evening, attempting to
                            shovel out Vesey Street. Mike went back that weekend to volunteer as a
                            surveyor. He describes in detail the scene which created the optical
                            illusion that the buildings were leaning, and he and his crew were able
                            to give the ‘ok’ that the surrounding buildings were safe to enter to
                            look for bodies. He feels that this experience has made him a different
                            person. Mike states that he can overcome problems now by using this
                            changed perspective, and that he has a new appreciation for life and the
                            quality of his life. Mike has a great deal of pride in the fact that he
                            worked on the new Trade Center. He laid the floors and on the 30th to
                            90th floors and also laid out the new reflecting pools. But, he finds it
                            distressing that people are beginning to forget and the event is
                            becoming just another part in the history books. When asked what he
                            would like future generations to remember, he states that everyone must
                            help. “If you can help, help. If you can make a difference, then make a
                            difference.”

       Chris was born in Brooklyn and moved upstate to Monroe, NY at the age of
                            five. He has six children and is currently retired from FDNY. The spring
                            and summer prior to September 11th were tough ones for him. Chris
                            recalls the two line of duty deaths the FDNY suffered, as well as his
                            own ongoing struggles with knee reconstruction surgery that was fraught
                            with complications and infections. He was at the medical center for a
                            checkup when he learned the first tower had been hit, and immediately
                            left to respond. Being a firefighter and knowing how the FDNY worked,
                            Chris was very aware that he would lose friends and coworkers who were
                            in the buildings. The situation was quickly becoming overwhelming, and
                            when he arrived at his firehouse everyone seemed in shock but ready to
                            do something. There was a computer generated list of about 500 names
                            that were listed as missing in action – this made him feel empty; it
                            didn’t seem possible that so many could be missing already. Chris
                            recalls the many hours he spent on the bucket brigade, trying to be as
                            respectful as possible when remains were found and yet being hampered by
                            the sheer volume of debris, fire and smoke. The heat was coming up
                            through the beams heating up his boots, and the smell was terrible. He
                            was issued a dust mask to wear and he knew he was in trouble when he saw
                            a bus of workers who came to clean up the inside of the phone building
                            in complete hazmat gear. “And I’m here in a t-shirt and a painters mask
                            on the pile.” After about two and a half weeks, cranes, dump trucks and
                            back hoes started coming in. Chris remembers sitting on a beam and
                            crying because he realized than that there were no survivors and that
                            his self-imposed mission was done – “There was no one left to find.” He
                            speaks of the hope that so many responders had that someone would be
                            found alive. Chris was compelled to attend as many funerals and
                            memorials as he could, and went to more than 50 funerals – sometimes
                            four in one day. One funeral that remains very clear in his memory was
                            for a co-workers son and son-in-law who died together in the towers.
                            Forced into retirement because of a heart issue, Chris began going to
                            church daily and writing in a notebook every morning. This was his
                            routine for two and a half years, and he believes that his faith in God
                            got him through this tough time. During his retirement, he volunteered
                            with the Red Cross and responded to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He feels
                            that volunteering has brought him back to life and has given him renewed
                            hope. “It’s all about giving back.” He had a very personal, spiritual
                            journey which brings him back full circle to 9/11. When asked what he
                            would like future generations to remember, he states to never give up;
                            it doesn’t matter how hard it gets, never give up and always have hope.
                            Make a positive difference in someone’s life.

       Lorraine has lived on Long Island all her life. She comes from a close
                            Italian family and has two nephews and one great-nephew. The boys were
                            teenagers on September 11th so she never really spoke to them about it,
                            although she recalls the great impact it has on the family and the whole
                            community – from the constant television coverage to the oddly silent
                            skies. On the morning of the disaster, Lorraine was at work. A chef came
                            in to tell her the towers had been hit, but she ignored him. Once she
                            saw it on TV, she began to make phone calls to see how they could help.
                            They partnered with the Red Cross to help feed the rescue workers, and
                            with the help of Whitson’s Food Service all preparations were made
                            overnight and they were able to go to the site the next day. Lorraine
                            remembers the drive in being very emotional. They were excited to be
                            going – to help and make a difference – but once they were there and saw
                            the people, it was very sad. The total devastation was surreal. She felt
                            unnerved, but pushed her feelings and emotions aside and got to work.
                            The prep area for the food was in a nearby school, so she would travel
                            back and forth. It was exhausting work, but after a while she didn’t
                            think about it. Anything they could find with wheels was used to
                            transport the food – push carts, baby carriages, even a convection oven
                            that was on wheels. Lorraine began using the time in the truck to have a
                            quiet moment, to close her eyes and cry. She remembers trying to lighten
                            the mood for the responders as she watched their enthusiasm for the task
                            dip – she would say things like, “Come on, who wants a belly-bomb burger
                            from White Castle?” People always wanted simple food – hamburgers,
                            peanut butter and jelly – fast, good, eat-and-go food. She remembers
                            having to turn away donated food that was too elaborate since no one
                            would eat it. When you work in hospitality, Lorraine states, you want to
                            impact people on a positive level. Sometimes it takes a crisis to bring
                            out the best in people, but “things slip back and become disgruntled
                            again.” When asked what she would like future generations to remember,
                            she says that these New Yorkers were amazing – people coming to help,
                            walking in while everyone else was running out. She would like people to
                            remember how “we came together, a gallant effort to find survivors” and
                            that everyone had a common goal to work together as a team. “Such loss
                            should never be forgotten.”

       The responder was a freelance videographer who came to the WTC site in
                            order to document the goings-on there so they would not be forgotten. He
                            lost his sister and her son in a Soviet misfire on a commercial airliner
                            in 1983, and has searched tirelessly for them as he believes they may
                            have survived the crash and were simply never returned home.
                            Nonetheless, he understands the loss many victims of 9/11 families
                            experienced. He came to the site a day after the attack, and began
                            capturing images of the rescue and recovery efforts there. He says that
                            at least initially he was treated with extreme hostility by the first
                            responders despite having the right permits to film at the site. They
                            saw him as a voyeur looking to make a buck off the evident suffering all
                            over the site. They wouldn’t let him near them for awhile, and he had to
                            capture a fireman’s body being recovered and memorialized with a zoom
                            lens because otherwise the firemen would have driven him off. He feels
                            that he served as important a role as the responders themselves—that
                            someone had to document the horror at the site for future generations to
                            vicariously examine and learn from. He says that while he was there he
                            felt a sense of emotional distance from what he was seeing, and that he
                            was just there to document it. He even brought his young daughter to the
                            site to help him take pictures, and comments that her naïve eye captured
                            some of the most stunning images he’s ever seen from the site. To him:
                            “There’s a strange beauty in horror.” Since then he feels that what he
                            saw has come home to roost though, he has had nightmares about the
                            scene. Despite his initial dispassion, he feels that whatever mechanism
                            that helped him hold off his emotions has since weakened. He now feels
                            that rapes, murder, robbery all are extensions of terrorism—using power
                            to frighten and oppress people. He also feels that despite the effort to
                            remember, the event will eventually be forgotten to the mists of
                            time.

       Thomas Dugan is a NYPD Patrol Officer in Far Rockaway, Queens at the
                            101st Precinct and has been since 8/31/1998. He grew up in Malverne in
                            Nassau County and is third generation NYPD. Thomas grew up always being
                            a part of NYPD and being a part of that circle, participating in parades
                            and various events that it was just a normal decision to become a police
                            officer. Thomas got married while he was still in the Police Academy and
                            has three children, who are now teenagers. On 9/10/01, Thomas was
                            working the 6pm-2am shift and didn’t get home until 5:30am on the day of
                            9/11. He went right to bed after his shift. His wife had gone to work
                            and the children went to day care. At 9:00am, his wife called him from
                            work and woke him up. She told him to put on the TV. His first response
                            was, “Really? You woke me up to watch TV?” It was the footage of the
                            burning towers and then the plane strike. Initially he thought it was a
                            freak accident, but when the second plane struck he knew it was an
                            attack, and he immediately headed back to work. He was amazed at how the
                            Southern State Parkway was empty. He showed his badge out his car window
                            to Nassau County PD who waived him on, all the way through to his
                            precinct. When he got to Peninsula Blvd he was able to see the plume of
                            smoke and noticed how the Manhattan skyline was now changed forever.
                            Thomas’s first assignment was to guard the Wall Street Bull because
                            there was a bomb threat against it. He also had to do security patrol at
                            the Bowling Green (park in lower Manhattan) and direct traffic on the
                            Westside Hwy. His muster point was Battery Park. They asked for
                            volunteers to help on The Pile and he did volunteer to so. That was
                            short lived after he saw his first body part. His most vivid memories of
                            the day after the attacks are the hip-high pile of women’s shoes, the
                            ankle deep layer of gray dust that looked like “the landscape of the
                            moon” and the terrible burnt smell and taste of chemicals, burnt bodies
                            and debris. Until this day, Thomas cannot handle the smell of burnt meat
                            because it reminds him of 9/11. He would cough up balls of black dust
                            and phlegm. It was also heartbreaking for him when relatives would come
                            up to him with the Missing Person photo and was asked if he had seen
                            them. He would always have to reply, “No”. On the lighter side, Thomas
                            did get to meet celebrity volunteers: Loretta Swift and Susan Sarandon,
                            who served him meals. He also had the opportunity to eat dinner on the
                            fancy boat, Spirit of NY. He also remembers a Red Cross volunteer
                            insisting on changing into clean socks and giving him and his unit brand
                            new socks to change into. Thomas attributes his family being the reason
                            why he is able to be grounded, just knowing that he had a family and a
                            stable place to go home anchored him mentally. He continues to have
                            bronchitis/asthma problems that he uses medication to control, but
                            doesn’t regret his time spent at Ground Zero. He would do it again if he
                            had to, and did assist in consecutive disasters: Flight 587 over the
                            Rockaways, Steam pipe explosion in Manhattan and Hurricane Sandy. Thomas
                            wishes that we would have rid the world of Al-Qaeda when we could have,
                            and believes we didn’t pay attention to the warning signs. He also
                            thinks we are still not paying attention because when terrorists say
                            “Death to America”, they mean what they say. He feels like a shepherd to
                            a flock of sheep. The wolves are circling the innocent sheep waiting to
                            devour them. The wolves are just waiting for the chance to attack. He is
                            hoping that those in positions above him are paying attention and being
                            a good shepherd. Thomas’s message to the future is “Don’t ever forget”.
                            He encourages everyone to never stop talking about 9/11 and to visit the
                            Memorial. He also thought this Oral History project was a good idea.
                            Thomas does not consider himself a hero; he was just doing his job, and
                            did what he needed to do to help.

       The responder is a detective with the NYPD who was present for the first
                            day in the debris of the twin towers. He describes his background with
                            the police department as a detective and investigator in the narcotic
                            division. He was mobilized, along with the rest of his division,
                            immediately following the attack. He relates that though they were sent
                            to the WTC site to muster, they were not given standing orders for what
                            to do when they arrived at the site, nor did they receive any orders for
                            some time afterwards. Consequently, they did whatever they felt was
                            useful, which predominately seems to have been search and rescue and
                            clearing the top layer of ash in bucket brigades. He describes the
                            initial response as frantic, as responders were hoping to find survivors
                            trapped in the rubble; unfortunately, there were very few and the effort
                            moved into a more mechanized and slower-paced effort after 1-2 weeks. He
                            feels the site was extremely unsafe, citing that he was unwilling to eat
                            the food for fear of it being contaminated, and that there was initially
                            very little actual safety equipment for people digging through the
                            rubble. He was transferred to the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island
                            after several weeks at ground zero, where he and other detectives sifted
                            through debris from ground zero for human remains and personal effects.
                            He describes the total absence of life and in the landfill, where the
                            best they could hope for was to find confirmation of death for the
                            families of the deceased. He considered the site unpleasant in the
                            extreme, even having been around bodies before in the course of his
                            occupation. He left the site in late October in order to be present at
                            home for the birth of his first child. He feels that recovery from the
                            event has not been completed, and may never be. He also fears that a
                            major terrorist attack is not only likely, but inevitable. He holds out
                            some hope that with increased communication between federal and local
                            agencies that the next time could be averted, or at least ameliorated by
                            vigilant law enforcement.

       Bill grew up in East Rockaway and has five brothers and one sister. He
                            retired from the NYPD after 20 years of service, and is currently
                            completing his Bachelor’s degree in Human Services. He is divorced with
                            three children. Bill started his career with the NYPD in the Housing
                            division. He was a patrolman in the south Bronx, which he found to be
                            shocking after growing up on Long Island. He was promoted to detective
                            after four years and transferred to Manhattan. In 1995, he moved to the
                            Crime Scene Unit. On September 11th, he was working a 7:00AM to 3:00PM
                            tour and was waiting to go to court. Dispatch said that the tower had
                            been hit, and they began getting supplies together and loading the cars
                            to leave. Because he was the ‘extra’ man on the shift – due to his court
                            date – he went to pick up the Inspector. The first tower came down, and
                            the tunnel was clogged with cars, dust and debris. It took a while to
                            get the tunnel cleared, and by then the second tower had fallen. If they
                            hadn’t been stuck on the other side of the tunnel, Bill states that they
                            would have been right at the foot of the towers, since the inspector was
                            the Commanding Officer of his team. The Crime Scene Unit was involved
                            with search and rescue, although Bill didn’t see anyone come out alive.
                            They were working side by side with FDNY, police officers and
                            construction workers. Eventually it turned into a recovery effort, and
                            the detectives began documenting and collecting evidence. As workers
                            found evidence or body parts, he would photograph it, try and identify
                            what it was, and tag it. Eventually the Medical Examiner came to work
                            with them, and it became much easier to identify the body parts.
                            Everything was kept in refrigerated trailers. They began a four day
                            rotation: one day at the site, one with the Medical Examiner, one at the
                            Staten Island Land Fill, and one day working their own crime scene case
                            load. This routine was followed for the next three months; Bill was
                            approaching his 20 year anniversary and began to think about retirement.
                            Then, a plane crashed in the Rockaways and this pushed him to fill out
                            his paperwork to retire. Working again with the Medical Examiner and the
                            FBI took its toll, and Bill felt “overloaded with dead people.” Bill is
                            unable to pull anything positive from his experience with the 9/11
                            disaster. He states that people don’t understand it, that they look at
                            the memorials and don’t get it. He avoids watching the shows that come
                            on the television every anniversary, and doesn’t speak about it. In
                            February of 2002, Bill started getting sick. He was coughing, had
                            frequent bloody noses and sinus issues despite the fact that he wore a
                            respirator. He feels he has no serious issues yet, but symptoms of what
                            is to come. He has asthma and borderline COPD.

       On 9/11/01, the responder was a retired NYFD firefighter enrolled in the
                            Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART). He was called to the scene on
                            the day of the attack, and his duties included transport to and from the
                            site, as well as digging through the debris as part of the
                            rescue/recovery effort. He worked at the site for three months. After
                            his time at the site, he developed respiratory infections in both lungs
                            due to inhalation of particulate bird feces from the collapsed
                            buildings, which has left him less vital than before his involvement at
                            the site. He also stresses the importance he places on volunteerism, and
                            that he intends to continue working as a volunteer firefighter for as
                            long as he is able. He encourages future generations to try and avoid
                            the conflict which made 9/11 possible, and work together towards a more
                            cooperative future for humankind.

       Bernard Hardy is now retired from NYPD and works as a Private
                            Investigator. He grew up in the Bushwick Section of Brooklyn with his
                            six siblings. He always wanted to become a cop to help people and so
                            became a Patrol Officer for nine years and then as a detective for
                            another 11 years. On the day of 9/11, Bernard was off from work and he
                            was on his way to the barber to get his hair cut. He had been working
                            undercover in a special Narcotics/Organized Crime Unit in plain clothing
                            in the worst areas of Brooklyn. He had received a call on his cell phone
                            that he all emergency personnel had to report to work. He drove on the
                            shoulder with his badge out the window all the way to the precinct. He
                            had to suit up—possibly losing his cover on the case that he had been
                            working on for the past several months. A van took him and other NYPD
                            officers over the Brooklyn Bridge to Ground Zero. He saw masses of dust
                            covered pedestrians walking over the Brooklyn Bridge. Everyone else was
                            leaving Manhattan but they were headed back in. Destruction was all
                            around him. Police cars were on fire. The dust that coated the streets
                            was knee deep and the remaining debris fell like snow. Stores were
                            deserted with everything left in its place. It was so quiet, abnormally
                            quiet for NYC. He knew the situation was bad, he thought he was going to
                            die. His cell phone didn’t work and wasn’t able to call home. He had a
                            wife and three children. His son would eventually become obsessed with
                            watching the news coverage of the attack in hopes to catch a glimpse of
                            father on TV. Bernard worked at Ground Zero securing the perimeter;
                            making sure that only authorized personnel entered the area. He was
                            functioning on pure adrenaline, working 16-17 hour days with only 1-2
                            hours’ sleep. He felt guilty if he rested too long. He was given paper
                            face masks to wear to protect him from the dust but they got dirty so
                            fast that it didn’t make a difference. Bernard worked at Ground Zero for
                            approximately one month. He could have left sooner to return to his
                            undercover case, but he opted to stay. Bernard loved the way the people
                            came together to support one another. He remembers the free food and
                            clothing items that were donated from people around the country. Even
                            McDonalds and Timberline were generous and donated food and boots to the
                            First Responders. Bernard currently lives in Westbury. He feels he is on
                            “borrowed time” because he survived 9/11. He is more cautious nowadays,
                            but he believes the government is doing a good job protecting us from
                            terrorism. He has great trust in our military. He knows many military
                            men personally and knows that they are dedicated to keeping our country
                            safe. He fears are of the “Lone Wolf” terrorists attacking the US more
                            than ISIS and their threats. Bernard would do it all over again if he
                            had to and hopes that our future generations will never have to endure
                            the same tragedy.

                            grandparents. While growing up, Al’s grandfather was an Assistant
                            Attorney General. He had an affluent upbringing with a lot of travel,
                            but he spent most of his time in New York. At age 18, he began to work
                            with a neighbor as a painter and in 1995 he joined the International
                            Union of Painters and Allied Trades, Local 1486. Al is very proud of his
                            work history and has been very active in the union, holding several
                            positions throughout his membership. For Al, September 11th, 2001 was a
                            normal work day. He was assigned to 125 Barclay Street, located just
                            north of the World Trade Center. Shortly after his day began, he became
                            aware of the attacks and could see where the plane had hit. He began to
                            head home, realizing that if he waited too long, he wouldn’t be able to
                            get out safely. At this point, he still thought it was an accident. The
                            next day, he was asked by the union to help clean up 125 Barclay Street.
                            This building became the morgue and a command center. Al recalls that
                            his experience put him in contact with a lot of remarkable people but he
                            was exposed to so much debris and toxins. He suffers from PTSD, sleep
                            apnea, and GERD. After 9/11, the company he worked for dissolved from
                            all the lawsuits that followed, leaving him out of a job. He wound up
                            homeless for a while, fishing for jobs. Fourteen years later, finances
                            are still tight and he has difficulty finding employment. As his health
                            declines, work becomes more and more difficult. Al hopes that people
                            remember the construction guys who were just as involved with the event
                            as the fire fighters and police officers. He finds it even more
                            frustrating that he was just laid off a job working at the memorial. He
                            wishes that the people who sacrificed and worked during the tough times
                            could be put back to work. The camaraderie of the union was broken on
                            9/11 and he hasn’t felt it since. September 11th, 2001 has affected
                            every aspect of his life. It has been a continuous burden. He describes
                            his involvement with the cleanup as very laborious, messy, and
                            exhausting. He has “tragic, fond, memories” of his experience.

       Robert lives in Suffolk County, Long Island. He grew up in Howard Beach,
                            Queens, and moved around for a few years teaching math and history. In
                            1983 he began working for the court systems. He spent five years in
                            Family Court and then was promoted to Manhattan Supreme Court. When he
                            retired, he was a Sergeant in the Manhattan Supreme Court. On September
                            11th, Robert was reporting to work and saw the smoke coming from the
                            towers – he thought a small plane must have hit one of the buildings.
                            Some of the officers went out to the court house roof to watch and they
                            saw the second plane hit. Robert could see the Trade Center from his
                            office window, and witnessed the first tower collapse. The court
                            officers closed the courthouse, and brought their water cooler out to
                            the sidewalk, where they witnessed a man having a heart attack. The
                            managed to get him to an ambulance, but Robert never learned if the man
                            lived or died. People were walking out of a wall of dust, covered in
                            white concrete dust. Knowing he was too old to run to the sight, and
                            lacking a gas mask, Robert nevertheless stayed on site to help as best
                            he could. Robert was temporarily assigned to OEM, the Office of
                            Emergency Management. He saw the hospital ships come into port with
                            Marines lining the deck, all carrying guns. There were many crazy
                            stories being circulated, and most of them were not true – one rumor was
                            that the military was ordered to shoot on site, so if you saw military
                            personnel you should hide. The first chaotic day, Robert worked 24 hours
                            straight. For the rest of his time he worked 24 hour shifts, with eight
                            hours off in between shifts, through Thanksgiving. The first night he
                            was able to go home, there were so many cars still in the train station
                            parking lot – it struck him that the owners of these cars all took the
                            train to work but died there. Robert remembers fondly the three court
                            officers who perished on 9/11; he worked with all of them and knew them
                            well. He remembers Mayor Giuliani speaking at their memorials, and found
                            his speeches touching. He felt the mayor went out of his way to know
                            personal details about the person, and therefor made the memorial more
                            meaningful. Things and people remind him of 9/11. Robert visits the
                            memorial in Washington DC every year, and has met numerous people that
                            he has befriended. He has made many positive connections and has great
                            camaraderie with these people, all of whom he would not know if not for
                            9/11. “We tried to do the best we could.” Robert hopes it doesn’t happen
                            again, but states we can’t hide away in a closet – we must be aware.
                            “The people who died were good people. We lost good people.”

       Belen is a New Yorker with a deep love for the city, living many years in
                            Manhattan. On the day of 9/11, she was working as a nurse in the
                            ophthalmology department of an area hospital. After watching the
                            unfolding drama on lobby televisions, Belen volunteered, with one other
                            coworker, to accompany the ophthalmologist to the WTC site to provide
                            emergency eye care. Arriving after the towers had collapsed, they set up
                            an eye-care and eye-wash station for first responders. Belen provided
                            care for a large number of people, especially responders, for the first
                            two days of search and rescue. Belen reminds viewers that we can all
                            “make a difference” if even in a small, but important way.

       Stephen Marsar grew up in Wantagh, a small town located in Nassau County
                            on Long Island. He is the youngest of 6 and had a fun childhood and a
                            great life. Mr. Marsar first attended college at Nassau Community
                            College and then attended Berkley in Massachusetts for music. Upon
                            graduating, Stephen moved down to Fairfax County in Virginia and joined
                            the fire department while he waited to be called for the FDNY test. To
                            Stephen being a part of the FDNY wasn’t just about a job. It was all
                            about helping people, the bond of a brotherhood. In August of 1990,
                            Stephen was hired by the FDNY and as of August 2015 he will be 25 years
                            on the job. On the morning of September 11th, Stephen actually had begun
                            the first day of his vacation from work. Although he was on vacation he
                            was on a promotional list to become a lieutenant, and had to report on
                            primary day at Randall’s Island to make sure everyone got promoted. As
                            he was driving into the city on the LIE, he heard on the radio that a
                            plane had hit one of the towers. Mr. Marsar knew this was a mistake
                            because it was a crystal clear day, no clouds, just a clear blue sky.
                            Stephen had a scanner in his car and connected to the dispatch
                            frequency. Just as he connected, news came over from the harbor that
                            another plane had crashed into the towers. Upon hearing about the second
                            tower, he pulled out his blue light indicating he was a first responder
                            and raced toward his firehouse. Within minutes of his arrival, he knew
                            that he had to get down to the scene. However, the captain was keeping
                            all of the firefighters at the firehouse from going downtown. Stephen
                            felt very frustrated, just like he had during the 93 bombings on the
                            Trade Center. So while the firefighters were forced to wait, everyone
                            just started to contemplate how to attack the fire. While the pieces of
                            the building started to fall faster, the firefighters found a bus driver
                            who would take them down to the WTC. As they were driving and separating
                            into groups, the tower collapsed and what everyone realized was that
                            they just lost 200 firefighters. The building had collapsed so suddenly
                            that the comprehension of it was hard to imagine. All that Stephen and
                            the rest of the firefighters that he was with knew was that a lot of
                            people needed to be saved. Arriving at the destroyed remains, it looked
                            like something out of a movie. From the destroyed towers to the defining
                            silence to the distant ringing of the missing firefighters radios, it
                            was a complete war zone. Although there was little to no communication
                            and no radios due to the system being down, little groups began to
                            organize to start to either fight the fires throughout Ground Zero or
                            begin the rescue effort. Stephen and his group went to World Trade
                            Center 7 to try to fight the fire that was raging inside. But
                            unfortunately, they couldn’t find a water line to hook up to. So, they
                            just let the fire burn and just started to look for people. As the
                            rescue effort went on and the realization that people weren’t going to
                            walk out of the towers alive, the rescue effort soon turned into finding
                            the bodies for the families. Tuesday turned in Wednesday and Wednesday
                            turned into Thursday, which was when Stephen finally was able to get
                            home to his family. The only reason he went home was when he received a
                            call from his ex wife saying his daughter was asking “Is Dad truly
                            okay?” That was when he knew he had to go home. But for Stephen, he only
                            went home for a short time. He had to get back to the Trade Center to
                            keep working. And he would work there until 2002.

       The responder is a retired NYPD detective who was present at the WTC site
                            on 9/11. He saw the attacks on the news, and assembled with his cohort
                            at 8th Avenue to change and go downtown. He recalls witnessing the
                            residents of Manhattan fleeing the city, and recalls the irony that he
                            was going into the mouth of hell while everyone else was fleeing. They
                            managed to get to the site just as the first tower collapsed, and for a
                            time he was presumed KIA before getting in contact with his unit again.
                            He saw people jumping from the tower and recalls seeing—and hearing—them
                            hit the ground in waves of thuds. He was taken to the ER after the
                            collapse and soon afterwards he realized that no one could have survived
                            the collapse of the towers. He describes the WTC site as “the largest
                            crime scene in US history,” a commentary on the magnitude and scope of
                            the destruction. After they began clearing the site and he was released
                            from the ER, he was assigned to the Fresh Kills landfill site. He and
                            other detectives sorted through mounds of debris to find personal
                            effects and body parts for analysis. He and his fellows were responsible
                            for investigating the attacks as a crime, as well as identifying the
                            dead. He doesn’t talk much about 9/11 with people very much; he doesn’t
                            want to frighten them with the gory details. He is currently a volunteer
                            at the tribute center as an orator, but it helps him feel better about
                            his involvement. He is fearful that what has happened before will happen
                            again almost inevitably. He just hopes that the lessons once learned
                            will remain in effect when it does. He hopes that good people, who he
                            believes are the overwhelming majority, will be able to keep disasters
                            like this from happening again.

       Tom grew up in Queens New York and attended Saint John’s University and
                            Nassau County Community College to earn a degree in Accounting. After
                            working in the field, he realized that he hated being in an office and
                            started his own landscaping company. He currently lives just eight
                            blocks from where he and his wife both grew up. On September 11th, Tom
                            was working close to home giving a customer an estimate when he saw the
                            news on her television. He went to a golf course where he knew he could
                            see the Manhattan skyline and saw all the smoke; then drove to a gun
                            shop where he knew the owner and purchased a shot gun and ammo. Knowing
                            that the police were going to be busy, he felt the need to protect his
                            own family and property. On September 12th Tom went to Tech Services in
                            Long Island City (FDNY supplies division) to help out by repairing
                            damaged fire trucks. Then he was asked to take a truck to the site to
                            deliver water so that the toilets could be flushed. After he arrived and
                            set up the hoses to create working toilets, he stepped outside the
                            supplies staging area and couldn’t believe what he saw. He stated it was
                            like being on a movie set, surreal. It seemed as though stuff was
                            everywhere, but not a single computer or keyboard: this image stays with
                            him because he thought that with so many businesses in the towers he
                            would have seen some evidence of them – but “everything was pulverized.”
                            After having seen an accident as a child and having terrible nightmares
                            from it, he promised himself that he would keep away from anything too
                            graphic. At times it was overwhelming but Tom could see that his help
                            was needed. He was given a tee shirt that said FDNY and put some
                            stickers on his own hard hat to try and blend in. He didn’t want to be
                            “some guy wandering around”, he wanted to blend in. He states even
                            without an official uniform he was never stopped because he was always
                            driving the FDNY van from Tech Services to the site. Tom recalls seeing
                            a large, burly contractor standing and crying; he was touched by this
                            and the two hugged for a little while but then went their separate ways.
                            “It was kind of an understanding” between the workers. Another time Tom
                            was stuck in a traffic jam filled with police officers and EMT’s, and
                            the crowds surrounding them were coming up to the cars to say thank you;
                            Tom felt he was an imposter, they thought he was a firefighter because
                            of his vehicle but “I’m just helping”. Avoidance helps Tom deal with the
                            traumas of 9/11 –he will not visit the site, and is frustrated that his
                            neighborhood is now predominantly people of Middle Eastern decent. “I’m
                            ready to move to the Mid-West and get away from it all.” Tom closes his
                            interview stating how his perspective has changed; enjoy life and live
                            while you can, because people were just doing their jobs and they died.
                            Live while you can.

       Stephen is a career truck driver, working for the Teamsters Union Local
                            during 9/11. On the day of the attacks, he was working his normal shift,
                            as part of a construction crew working on the Long Island Expressway.
                            Returning home later that day, he watched television in shock as the
                            events unfolded. After 2 weeks of inaction, and eager to contribute, he
                            went to work for a NYC-area trucking company. Stephen would then be part
                            of a large number of truck drivers ferrying WTC debris away from site,
                            to the Staten Island landfill. Stephen offers details on this part of
                            the cleanup process. Although not present during the attacks, Stephen
                            offers a perspective often overshadowed by the heroism of first
                            responders; that of the skilled labor present at the WTC site during the
                            aftermath and cleanup.

       Irma was born in Puerto Rico but was raised in Brooklyn, NY. She has a
                            degree in Social Science from Saint Joseph’s University in Brooklyn and
                            has worked in foster care, social services, and as a Probationary
                            Officer. She states that she has always wanted to help people, and was
                            one of the oldest recruits in her NYPD academy class. She retired from
                            the force in 2004. She is married and has no children. On September
                            11th, Irma was at the academy participating in role play. Someone came
                            in and asked that if anyone had family working in the towers to step out
                            with them. They didn’t know yet that the towers had been hit; she had
                            many missed phone calls from her husband, and when she called him back
                            he told her. She recalls the chaotic atmosphere and the buildings
                            falling. Being bilingual, Irma was given the task to call the Spanish
                            speaking families of police officers who were unaccounted for. She
                            became a liaison for the NYPD families who were looking for their
                            missing loved ones; she would take them to the site, listen to their
                            stories and look at their pictures. She recalls being on the pile with a
                            family and the soles of her boots began to melt from the heat of the
                            fires under the rubble. She attended many memorial services with the
                            families, often with an empty casket which made it even more difficult.
                            Irma states she had a role to play, to “keep it together” and be strong
                            for the families, but it was very emotionally draining. As a newlywed,
                            her husband kept asking her when she would be home, when was she coming
                            home – and she would reply, “Just be thankful I’m able to come home.”
                            She became very appreciative of life and was very thankful for the
                            support she received from her husband and mother. Irma remembers being
                            told it was ok to wear a small paper mask because the air quality was
                            safe, but she didn’t wear it around the families since they were not
                            given anything to wear and she didn’t want to add to the distress they
                            were already going through. She now suffers from asthma and has many
                            friends who have died, and another recently diagnosed with cancer. She
                            is also still quite vigilant – she always knows where the exits are and
                            can’t seem to “take my ‘cop hat’ off”. Having a very strong faith in God
                            helps Irma believe that everything happens for a reason. She would like
                            people to remember that we survived this day in history, that we’ve come
                            a long way but there is still far to go. She urges everyone to
                            appreciate what they have today, good bad or indifferent, because
                            “tomorrow is promised to no one.”

       Warner grew up in East Northport, Long Island. He attended Stony Brook
                            University, and has a Law degree from Saint John’s University. He became
                            a police officer with the NYPD in 1992 and responded to both terror
                            attacks on the Twin Towers, 1993 and 2001. He feels it is very important
                            for future generations to remember this has happened two times. In 1993
                            Warner was 22 years old and new to the NYPD, assigned to the 77th
                            Precinct in Brooklyn. He responded to the 2/26/93 car bombing at One
                            World Trade and describes the devastation in the garage; he states he
                            was surprised that the tower didn’t fall then because there was so much
                            damage. He recalls the acrid smell at the site in 1993, and states it
                            was the same in 2001. “New York City has a target on it.” He always
                            thought something would happen again, and feels very vulnerable. In
                            2001, Warner was a Lieutenant working in Forrest Hills Queens at the
                            112th Precincts. September 11th was the mayoral primaries, and he had
                            election duty in Rego Park until the polls closed. He had seen the
                            attacks on television at home and called the desk to say he was coming
                            in early. He recalls the beauty of the day and the tremendous amount of
                            traffic on the Long Island Expressway; he had to show his police
                            credentials to be allowed through. A Sergeant and eight police officers
                            had been dispatched to the site and all contact with them was lost. It
                            was later learned that the Sergeant driving the van had backed away just
                            in time as the first tower began to fall; the sergeant ended up in the
                            water and was picked up by Harbor Patrol. Warner reported to the site
                            for the first time on September 13th. He recalls that the National
                            Guardsman were everywhere with rifles, and the whole place was on
                            lockdown. He describes the dust, heat and soot – he states that every
                            time a big piece of debris would be moved, oxygen would rush into the
                            space resulting in a plume of fire. He goes on to describe in detail the
                            sights and smells of the early chaotic days at the pile. Feeling bitter,
                            “proud, but with a taste of bitterness,” Warner wonders if we learned
                            anything. He recalls the conflicting information from the politicians
                            that the air was fine; yet they would see EPA workers running around
                            franticly trying to get everyone to wear masks. He feels like he is
                            being “stalked by cancer” and wonders how all the volunteers’ health is,
                            and the steel workers – people who were there but he feels tend to be
                            overlooked. Warner concludes his interview by saying we all need to
                            protect ourselves, despite what we may be told. “Maintain vigilance.”
                            And he would like everyone to remember that it was ordinary Americans
                            who stepped up to help when they were needed most.

       Lisa was born in Brooklyn, NY and moved to Santa Cruz, CA at 10 days old.
                            Her parents were form the East Coast and she has one younger brother.
                            Lisa left California to attend college at Cornell University in Upstate
                            New York, which then brought her to Israel for a fellowship after
                            college. Post fellowship, she moved to Ohio then onto New York, where
                            she has stayed since. Her parents still live in California but visit New
                            York frequently, while her brother and his family live in Arizona. Lisa
                            currently lives in Westchester, NY right on the Hudson River with her
                            husband and two girls. Her fellowship in Israel was working for the
                            Israeli President, which brought her into jobs in politics in the United
                            States. She moved back to NYC and started working campaigns for the
                            Mayor of NYC in 1997. She then started working for current Senator,
                            Chuck Schumer in 1998. Senator Schumer’s wife, Iris, worked for the
                            Department of Citywide Administrative Services, so after Lisa got her
                            Master’s in Public Administration at Columbia University, she started an
                            internship working for DCAS. Starting her career in City Government
                            eventually becoming the Assistant Commissioner for Operations and
                            Strategic Planning. Her division was involved with other outside
                            agencies, since they were the behind the scenes people. They had a seat
                            on the Office of Emergency Management that dealt with hurricanes and
                            snowstorms. The morning of 9/11, she voted then got to work, earlier
                            than normal at the municipal building on the 17th floor, which is
                            located right next to city hall. She heard a loud boom and saw
                            “confetti” in the air and she didn’t understand, since her division
                            would put on the parades, she didn’t understand why there was confetti
                            at 8-9AM. They saw the second planes explosion into the second tower and
                            since Lisa has spent a lot of time in Israel she knew that this was a
                            terrorist attack and called her father in California. Lisa and her
                            coworker Tim were supposed to be heading down to OEM headquarters at 7
                            World Trade when they ran into the commissioner and stuck with him.
                            Which then led them to be with the Mayor and everyone trying to get in
                            touch with the government in D.C. Knowing they weren’t supposed to be in
                            that room, they started to make their way to 7 World Trade to meet with
                            OEM. While standing there waiting to help others, she could hear the
                            jumpers falling and hitting the ground. Then the ground began to shake
                            and they were ushered into a safer place. They were able to get out of
                            the building, after is collapsed and crumbled around them, after 20
                            minutes. At this point, only one of the towers had fallen and she was
                            standing on Greenwich Street, looking at Tower 1. Heading back to the
                            municipal building they reunited with all the main government officials
                            while she tried to understand what just happened. After the buildings
                            fell, they were ushered up North on Manhattan Island just trying to get
                            in touch with their families and she wound up being able to go back to
                            her coworker Tim’s girlfriend’s apartment. She recalls how Mid-town
                            Manhattan was acting like nothing happened downtown, it was business as
                            usual. She managed to get to her apartment on the Upper West Side and
                            her friends joined her and her now husband to watch the news that
                            evening. The next morning she was called into work to the make shift OEM
                            office being set up at the Police Academy, which was close to Ground
                            Zero. By the third day, all operations have moved to the pier and that
                            is where she was able to get her work done. Since 9/11 Lisa’s compassion
                            has grown tremendously. She began going to seminary to become a Rabbi
                            and continue to help others. Hoping that people will eventually come to
                            and understanding that not everyone wants the same thing and handles
                            situations differently.

       Terry grew up with a strong circle of childhood friends, all of which
                            shared the common goal of becoming a part of FDNY or becoming a police
                            officer. They all took a civil service test and waited for a call from
                            FDNY. In the meantime, Terry took a job as a corrections officer, then a
                            bay constable, and finally was offered a job with the Suffolk Country
                            Police Department. When he received a call from FDNY, he decided to stay
                            with the SCPD and turned down the offer. His friends went into the city
                            fire department but through the years they all remained close. On
                            September 10th, 2001, Terry was promoted to Sargent and transferred to
                            the K-9 unit. He was assigned to a cadaver dog named Joker and began
                            learning how to be a dog handler. On September 11th, 2001, half of the
                            SCPD K-9 unit dogs were brought in immediately to assist with the rescue
                            efforts. Terry and Joker went to the site very late that night. Terry
                            had received several phone calls during the day from the wives of his
                            missing friends who were FDNY fire fighters. When he arrived to the
                            site, he was confronted with the enormity of the disaster and knew they
                            were unable to make it out. The dogs were very well trained and worked
                            great under the pressure. Terry quickly learned how to be a K-9
                            instructor. As a sergeant he was also responsible for other police
                            officers. He was very concerned about their safety in such a hazardous
                            environment. After about 3 weeks, they began to scale back as site
                            transitioned into a recovery effort. All together Terry lost ten
                            friends, four of which were very close friends. Terry knows his friends
                            went into the towers to try and save people. He knows they did the right
                            thing. They approached the scene probably thinking “I don’t want to do
                            this” but they were brave and courageous. They did the best they could.
                            He still sees some of the wives and children of those friends who lost
                            their lives in the attacks. They have moved forward in their lives but
                            Terry remains very supportive of the children who lost their fathers-
                            especially with big moments in their lives like proms and graduation.
                            Once a year he takes some of them on family vacations. Terry avoids the
                            site. It is a painful memory. About a year after the attacks, he moved
                            out of the house he was living in. In the past his friends had helped
                            him with so many projects throughout the house. His home became a
                            painful reminder. He recalls that working so much after the attacks was
                            a good distraction but in the back of his mind was the tremendous
                            personal loss. He had a solid group of childhood friends that were all
                            taken from him in one day.

       John grew up in Queens, and because of an early fascination with the fire
                            department, became a junior fireman. Living only a block from his
                            neighborhood fire house, he spent a lot of time there, and in his words
                            “grew up in the firehouse.” These early influences certainly inculcated
                            a strong sense of duty and service. Later he served in the Army, but was
                            injured, and suffered a TBI. John also had to overcome a lifelong
                            stuttering problem, an issue he still struggles with. Despite these
                            handicaps, John was present at the WTC site, through his local fire
                            station, and helped with the bucket brigade. Later he would serve with
                            the Red Cross, working tirelessly in their warehouse. John tells viewers
                            that there is a job for everybody, and even people with a handicap
                            deserve a chance. John embodies this devotion to duty, and his actions
                            and perseverance are a model for us all.

       Freeman was a long-term employee of the New York State Department of
                            Transportation, working first as a traffic agent, and then later as a
                            bus driver. He considers himself a Manhattanite, even though he now
                            lives on Long Island. Freeman is the father of 5 children. On the
                            morning of 9/11 Freeman was working his usual shift as a bus driver,
                            driving the express route in Manhattan. As he sees the same people every
                            day, he came to see them like members of his family. Saw second plane
                            hit on television set at dispatcher’s office. Freeman was driving his
                            route after collapse of towers, and states main roads like a “ghost
                            town” but police allowing buses to pass through. Freeman is a licensed
                            minister, and as some of his regular passengers know this, they had
                            conversations about nature and cause of attack. How could this have
                            happened? Why? Freeman relates, poignantly, a story of a passenger’s
                            spouse who died on 9/11. Every day Freeman would see a devoted husband
                            put his wife on the bus, each morning, before going to work at the WTC.
                            The man died in one of the buildings. Freeman tells listeners how
                            strange it is not to see this man every day. Freeman also explains his
                            persistent unease and insecurity following the attacks. On the Saturday
                            after 9/11 attacks, Freeman was tasked with the job of ferrying NYPD and
                            FDNY workers at WTC site. Describes WTC site, debris and smoke and ash.
                            On second Saturday, Freeman was nearby when workers pulled out steel
                            I-beams shaped like a cross. When right up to it and stared, captivated
                            by the view. But soon after 9/11 Freeman opted for early retirement, his
                            sense of trust and security now broken. But despite this Freeman feels
                            God is holding onto him, and this is a profound source of comfort.

       The responder was a paramedic on site, and had recently graduated from
                            paramedic training. She had previous experience being an EMT, but had
                            never responded to a disaster on this scale before. She was responsible
                            for check-ups and physicals on the workers in the pit, but was not in it
                            herself. She was struck by the magnitude of the response, with
                            donations, volunteerism, and sympathy from the community vastly
                            outstripping her expectations. She was amazed by the scope of the
                            debris, and relates that on the first night she was there(9/14) dust was
                            falling out of the sky with the rain, bathing the site and making it
                            seem like an active warzone. She feels her term as an EMT desensitized
                            her to the horror at the site, so she wasn’t too emotionally affected by
                            it. She was particularly struck by the Police and firemen assemblage
                            when they recovered the bodies of one of their own. Her final takeaway
                            was her pride to be there, an American citizen, and to be a New
                            Yorker.

       Michael was a member of NYPD’s Technical Assistance Response Unit (TARU)
                            and was involved with search and rescue at WTC site, as well as taking
                            videos and still photos as part of his responsibilities. Michael is a
                            NYC native, growing up in Brooklyn. He entered police academy on 1990,
                            graduating in 1991. Worked in various capacities, but transferred to
                            TARU in 1999. On day of 9/11 was on duty, working a day shift. Heard
                            radio call of small plane striking first tower, and assumed it was a
                            small plane. Headed to site, heard report of second plane strike while
                            still in car. Parked 1 one block away. Michael describes scene of
                            falling debris, streets littered with pieces from planes, as well as
                            human body parts. Was at One World Financial Center when he heard
                            rumbling noise, and saw first tower collapse. Located and helped other
                            police officers get out of building, and immediately covered in dust.
                            Started moving towards other tower to render aid, and saw second tower
                            implode. Moved away from site, regrouped with fellow officers, and
                            returned to site to aid in search and rescue/recovery. During his time
                            at WTC site his team lowered microphones down into debris to listen for
                            trapped survivors. Also, captured WTC site with videos and photos as
                            part of his job. Was present at this site for 2-3 months, on a daily
                            basis, working 12 hour shifts. Sometime even longer. Michael also
                            expresses concern about levels of contamination during his time at WTC
                            site. Michael also worked at other sites, including landfill. Soon after
                            9/11 Michael developed significant health problems, including cancer and
                            respiratory problems. Medically retied from NYPD. Respiratory problems a
                            daily reminder of 9/11: just climbing a flight of stairs renders him
                            breathless. Michael offers a vivid account of the collapse of the
                            towers, and chaos on the streets surrounding the WTC. Importantly,
                            Michael captures the health-related concerns of first responders, and
                            their ongoing efforts to maintain a normal quality of life.

       Richard grew up with a very mixed background compared to other kids his
                            age in the 60s and 70s. He was born in Floral Park (Queens) and his
                            grandparents whom he frequently visited lived in Springfield Gardens.
                            Richard came from a very mixed ethnic background of all races with his
                            grandparents being of European descent as well as Native American as
                            well. This largely affected him in life because he was different then
                            most kid his age. Also, seeing as his parents divorced right before high
                            school, he had to deal with two very distinct social classes of friends.
                            In Nassau where he originally lived, he had all white friends but where
                            he moved to in Queens with his mom, it was all African American. So for
                            Richard, growing up as the only white person in a black neighborhood was
                            rough but what was harder was having those two different types of friend
                            groups. But things got better for him as following his high school
                            graduation; Richard immediately flew down to South Carolina to begin his
                            Marine Core training. This brought a sense of pride for him as his
                            entire family on both sides had been apart of the armed forces and he
                            was following right in their footsteps. Unfortunately for Richard, his
                            military career was cut short upon his arrival in North Carolina when
                            the doctors found high levels of protein in his kidneys and the doctors
                            weren’t sure if it was fatal or not hence his release from the armed
                            forces. Upon his return home he kept busy earning himself a volunteer
                            firefighter position as well as other numerous jobs until he gained a
                            job with the New York Transit Authority. This job maintained his true
                            connection to 9/11 and how he became involved on that tragic day. On the
                            morning of 9/11, Richard was working as a Bus Operator whose bus ran
                            right through the Battery Park tunnel. On September 11th though, he was
                            working in the bus depot going over inventory, making sure buses had
                            fuel etc. Someone else was driving his route and his bus was there when
                            the towers hit. He will never forget the bus operator of that bus
                            because said bus operator was a coward according to Richard. The bus
                            driver stopped the bus full of people on Cortland Street, told them to
                            “get out” and then he himself ran out of the bus. Thankfully they all
                            ran out but to this day, Richard still holds contempt over him. While
                            this was happening in the Battery Park area, Richard was watching the
                            towers slowly decimate before his eyes. Upon the second tower get hit by
                            the second plane he just knew that something was truly wrong. So, he
                            turned to his head to his head of union and depot and just pointed to
                            the towers. All they said to him were “Be careful, call home” He
                            immediately drove to Ladder 168 and Engine 245 where he met Chief
                            McCormack who looked at him and said “I need a bus.” So, Richard drove
                            back to the bus depot, pretty much stole a bus, and drove back to the
                            firehouse. He loaded up 30 firefighters both from the house and
                            volunteers and off they went to the towers. On the way they picked up
                            medical supplies and firefighters finally arriving at Ground Zero. When
                            they got there, anywhere Richard could be, he went. It was complete
                            chaos everywhere you looked. For him, he couldn’t think about the lives
                            lost, he just had to keep working. As he continued to work, he compared
                            it to Death Valley due to the stillness at times and the dust. Finally,
                            someone came up to Richard and asked him if he had gotten in touch with
                            his wife. When he replied with a no, someone told him to contact his
                            wife. Truly the only reason he went home was because of his daughter. He
                            had found a picture of a baby and realized that baby was missing their
                            parent now. That picture reminded him of his daughter which gave him a
                            reason to go home and to work even harder when he was down at the sight.
                            For Richard, 9/11 was a time of loss, reminders, and of realization. He
                            learned so much from this tragic day and now has so much to share to
                            others because of it. 9/11 is the reason Richard went on to gain his
                            masters and join FEMA as part of his own recovery from what he saw that
                            day. It gave him hope, and a new look at life but like many others it
                            still left him with questions and a hole in his heart that has yet to be
                            filled.

       The responder is a retired police officer who was mobilized on 9/11,
                            along with her firefighter husband. The majority of the interview
                            focuses on family and loss, since both of Eileen’s sisters worked in the
                            World Trade Center towers when they were hit. One survived, but only
                            because she was late to work on that particular day. Eileen relates that
                            she and her sister refused to believe their third sister had been
                            killed, and had survived in a caveat within the superstructure of the
                            building. They only gave up after over two weeks of fruitlessly
                            searching for her. Their deceased sister’s remains were positively
                            identified more than two years later. Eileen relates that the event has
                            had a profound effect on her life, and the lives of her loved ones and
                            comrades. She and her sister both fell into depression after the
                            attacks; though Eileen says she has escaped it, her sister still feels
                            survivor’s guilt from being one of only a handful of her cohort who
                            survived. Her husband refuses to talk about the attacks still, and
                            prefers to bottle up his emotions. Both Eileen and her husband have lost
                            many friends to cancer after the hazardous cleanup effort, and Eileen
                            herself has suffered from tumors. Her ultimate take away from the event
                            is that it made people band together and help one another, and she hopes
                            that spirit can be maintained without the need for a major tragedy.

       Andrew grew up in a small town in Upstate New York with his parents and
                            an older brother. Going to College at SUNY Plattsburgh post high school
                            to receive a Bachelor’s Degree in Criminal Justice with a minor in
                            Sociology. His parents retired down to North Carolina but his brother
                            stayed in Upstate New York and currently works for West Point. Andrew
                            always knew that he wanted to be a cop, thought it was so interesting
                            and wanted to catch the bad guys. His parents were always very
                            supportive of him and his brother going into the law enforcement and
                            military fields. Andrew started his career off in law enforcement
                            working for the Bureau of Prisons then moved onto Immigration and
                            Naturalization Services which then lead him to work for Alcohol, Tobacco
                            and Firearms, which is where he is till this day. Andrew met his wife
                            while working a case with her for ATF, as she is a Federal Prosecutor
                            and they now have two young children together. Andrew’s office was
                            located in Lower Manhattan at 6 World Trade Center, so the morning of
                            9/11 he was leaving his house in Upstate New York to head into the city.
                            Right as he was leaving, he heard on the news that a small plane had hit
                            the tower, right then he knew that he would be working a long day
                            because his division worked with explosions and they were very close to
                            the North tower. On his way into the city, his partner called him and
                            gave him the update that a second plane had hit the South tower and
                            that’s when Andrew put his lights on and headed full speed into the
                            city. He felt this sense of urgency that he needed, wanted and had to
                            get downtown to be there to help. By the time he had gotten downtown,
                            the South tower had already fallen. He recalls getting his equipment out
                            of his trunk and hearing the jumpers. Andrew and a few of his colleagues
                            were waiting to meet with their other co-workers and they saw a
                            firefighter running around the corner yelling “the tower’s falling”.
                            They ran for their lives towards the Hudson River, trying to get away
                            from the smoke and debris funneling towards them. After the towers had
                            fallen, there was a sense of calm in the air, like what else could
                            happen? Andrew was able to get in touch with his co-workers via a radio
                            and they were told to meet up at Chelsea Pier. Before heading to the
                            pier, the ATF agents that were able to muster together paired of in
                            teams of two to walk around lower Manhattan in search of other agents.
                            They made their way back to Chelsea Pier and they were brought over to
                            Brooklyn so they could get cars to go back home. Andrew headed home for
                            the night, only to be back in Brooklyn by 4AM the following day.
                            Starting the next day, they were tasked to set up and start the rescue
                            efforts. Andrew and his team were on the bucket brigade for about three
                            weeks plus. He describes his time down on the pile being horrible and
                            putting a lot of things into perspective, especially understanding what
                            they were pulling out of the pile and realizing its human remains. At
                            the time they didn’t take being around all that smoke seriously but
                            looking back on it, he realizes they should have been more careful. He
                            wound up working down at the site for about three weeks before they were
                            switched over to Fresh Kills landfill. He spent time working the
                            conveyer belts, removing essential items from the belts and recalls it
                            being a very sad necessary place. After 9/11 Andrew volunteered to work
                            security at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. Being out there, he
                            realized the change in how everyone views have changed and how outsiders
                            can be very compassionate. They also sent agents down to Louisiana to
                            help with Hurricane Katrina efforts. Andrew doesn’t want the terrorist
                            attacks to be absorbed with the rest of history. He believes that the
                            more people that are looking out for the bad guys, the more likely they
                            can stop something else on this scale from happening again.

       The responder is a retired member of NYPD precinct 10 who was present at
                            ground zero just after the collapse of the twin towers. He describes
                            that he was involved in a similar disaster, the Hyatt hotel collapse in
                            Kansas City in 1981. Though not intentionally made disaster, he says the
                            response among volunteers was similarly touching. After his experience
                            in Kansas City, he returned to New York and joined the NYPD in 1984. He
                            retired early in 1994 due to a personal injury, and went back to school
                            for nursing—which is how he experienced 9/11. He remembers being stunned
                            at the horror of watching the second plane hit the tower, and watching
                            people leap from the tower to escape the inferno. He was called as a
                            responder a few days after the attack, and was an ambassador to a
                            “Management Support Team,” who were unfamiliar with the city but needed
                            a way to plan logistical support. He also recalls the delivery of bodies
                            to the city morgues, including the family members who lined up to see if
                            their loved ones were among the dead. He feels that firefighters and
                            other responders were not adequately protected from hazards at the site,
                            and that they have since received far less assistance than they
                            deserve.

       Bob grew up in New Jersey but always wanted to be a New Yorker. After
                            traveling the world, Bob finally settled in Battery Park City in the
                            late eighties. He recalls the building of the World Trade Center, when
                            the excavations started to take place, they were putting all the dirt
                            and gravel removed into the Hudson River, essentially adding acreage
                            onto the end of Manhattan. People used to go out there and use it like a
                            beach since it was just open landscape. Bob worked for a company called
                            Aon as a Media Inventor and worked on the 102 floor of the World Trade
                            Center before moving to another company called Willis before 9/11. From
                            his office windows on the 102nd floor, Bob could see his apartment. He
                            had a longer vertical commute then he did horizontal. On the morning of
                            9/11, Bob and his wife Cora went to the World Financial Center to vote
                            in the primary election, which was right across the street from World
                            Trade. While standing in line, they felt the tension of the room change
                            and when they looked outside and saw what they thought was confetti
                            coming down. Bob and Cora walked outside, noticing chunks of concrete
                            were falling down, looked up to see the hole in the side of the
                            building. Bob, an amateur photographer, had a camera with him and
                            started to take pictures within two minutes of the first plane hitting
                            Tower 1. They went back to their apartment to get Cora a camera they
                            were over on the North Side of World Trade Center and they could see an
                            American commercial jet fly over buildings and into the side of Tower 2.
                            Bob knew while watching the plane hit the tower that it couldn’t have
                            been an American Airlines pilot flying the plane. He knew at that moment
                            the world had changed. Bob immediately started to think of his old
                            coworkers and if they were in the building. They went looking for all
                            the people they knew but they were gone. While the buildings collapsed,
                            they were trapped within all the smoke and debris circulating downtown.
                            While trying to make it back to their apartment in Battery Park City,
                            Cora and Bob were stopped by National Guardsmen and were shuffled onto a
                            police boat headed towards New Jersey. They had no choice but to leave
                            the area. After receiving medical clearance in New Jersey, they took an
                            Amtrak train down to Philadelphia, where they had friends they could
                            stay with. Bob and his wife Cora dealt with breathing problems post
                            9/11. Cora was effected immediately and Bob was effected later on. He
                            speaks heavily on the health issues that surrounded the smoke and the
                            air everyone was breathing in. When the government was telling everyone
                            the air was safe, Bob knew something was wrong. For about a month or two
                            after the attack, Bob’s friend let them use his apartment in Greenwich
                            Village and they were able to commute downtown to their jobs. While they
                            were displaced, they were given a group number of when they were allowed
                            back into their apartments. They were allowed about five minutes, two or
                            three times over the course of a month, to grab their belongings
                            (though, they weren’t supposed to remove anything) and were escorted by
                            the National Guard before they opened the building back up. Bob went
                            back into the apartment without his wife and said it was covered in what
                            he called it “crematorium dust”. He took a couple of pictures of his
                            apartment, describes how it looked and how long it took to clean all the
                            dust off of the complex surfaces. They weren’t given any breathing
                            protection when they were allowed back into their apartment building.
                            They used breathing masks for about a year or more after 9/11 while
                            walking to and from work, being able to see the remanence of dust all
                            over the buildings and streets. Bob is now a Community Board Member and
                            a member of the Survivor Steering Committee. He wants to make sure that
                            the survivors, residents, undocumented workers, any one effected is
                            taken care of. That they are provided with the medical care that they
                            need and to make sure that these types of programs don’t disappear with
                            time.

       Andrew was born in Brooklyn, but was raised in New Hyde Park, LI with his
                            two older sisters. He studied Criminal Justice at St. John’s University
                            for 2 years and then worked for the Thoroughbred Racing Protective
                            Bureau (TRPB) tattooing race horses with identification numbers. He
                            eventually took the NYPD exam just to see how he’d do, not really
                            planning on becoming a police officer, but was offered a position in the
                            NYPD and accepted it. Andrew started in Queens on the “mounted unit”,
                            where he worked for a couple of years, then was promoted to a precinct
                            in Brooklyn, and then promoted again to a “plain clothes unit” and
                            eventually to a detective squad in 1989. He worked in the anti-crime
                            unit and the robbery identification program (RIP). Andrew was living on
                            Long Island with his wife and two sons at the time of the September 11th
                            attacks. That morning he had just finished his night shift in Crown
                            Heights, Brooklyn and was scheduled to start work again at 8AM. Another
                            officer told Andrew what was happening and the two of them went up to
                            the roof of their building to get a better view of the World Trade
                            Center, where they watched as the second plane hit. They went downstairs
                            with the rest of the officers to turn on the city-wide radio, where they
                            could hear other officers who were in the buildings calling for help. At
                            first, Andrew’s unit was assigned to an area hospital to assist with
                            injuries, but once they realized there would be no survivors with
                            injuries they worked their way closer to the site. For one week Andrew
                            worked at the Medical Examiner’s station to help coordinate the incoming
                            victims’ remains and helped with identification. He recalls the memory
                            of the emotions and tension that broke out whenever remains were found
                            wrapped in a fireman’s jacket. After that, he arrived to work at Arthur
                            Kills landfill, where he described the scene as “surreal”. There, he
                            helped separate and organize the debris from the attacks. Wearing only a
                            paper mask to cover his face, Andrew was concerned about the “toxic
                            brew” that he was breathing in. Eventually, the location became more
                            sophisticated with food, filtered air, and a decontamination area for
                            the workers. In the 8 months that Andrew worked at the landfill he
                            noticed they weren’t finding any of the typical debris you would find in
                            an office, like computers or desks, but instead found personal items
                            like photos, wallets, jewelry, and dolls. He said that everyone working
                            at the site had a sort of “quiet rage” about what had happened and the
                            devastation. Andrew retired in 2002, shortly after 9/11, believing that
                            his involvement with the clean-up may have pushed him to do so. He
                            doesn’t talk much to his family about his work during 9/11, unless they
                            ask him questions. Today, he feels that this experience has changed him
                            as a person and how he views society, and he hopes that people won’t
                            forget this historic event. He wants future generations to remember the
                            human part of the attacks and remember the real people involved. He
                            believes that they’re all victims; those who worked in the World Trade
                            Center buildings, who responded to the attacks, who helped clean-up, and
                            those who are now getting sick with illnesses related to their work at
                            ground zero.

       Joseph “Joe” served 30 years with the NYPD, retiring in 2008. He worked
                            for many years as a detective, and most importantly, as Crime Scene
                            Supervisor, processing over 2,300 crime scenes and 1,000 homicides.
                            Transferred to the Forensics Lab, Joe played a key role in the
                            development of the DNA database, now so important to police
                            investigatory work. Joe graduated from St. John’s University in 1976,
                            and after a brief stint with the FBI, was hired by NYPD in 1979. Joe
                            started as a patrol officer (foot patrol), with an eventual promotion to
                            detective. Later transferred to forensics, gaining expertise in
                            evidence/DNA/crime scene processing. On 9/11 Joseph was in his office,
                            finishing a double shift. Learns of plane strike, followed by the
                            second, and drives to site with colleagues. Arrives to find Emergency
                            Services Unit on site, as well as NYPD. Soon after, hears radio chatter
                            warning of imminent collapse, and climbs under truck for protection.
                            Afterwards, assists fellow officers and FDNY with search and recovery
                            efforts. Joe provides vivid descriptions of the Ground Zero, before and
                            after tower collapses. Reminds viewers that this has to be treated like
                            any other crime scene, albeit on a larger scale, and provides insights
                            on this matter. This interview also contains powerful moments, as when
                            Joe describes the steps rescue workers took after finding a body (or
                            body part) in the rubble- whistle sounds, work stops, body is covered
                            with flag, and everyone salutes as it is carried past. Joe’s
                            professionalism and dedication is clear. This video is a must-watch.

       Victoria grew up in an Irish/German area of Brooklyn, New York. Growing
                            up she wanted to be a Veterinarian but ultimately went into Engineering
                            at City College. When she graduated, there were few female engineers so
                            there were many jobs. Sometime after the field began to slump and jobs
                            got smaller while the benefits were less. Vicky knew she needed
                            stability and wanted a union pension so she started working for the New
                            York Transit Authority. She dealt with some tensions of being a woman
                            but pushed through four years of working the night shift to finally
                            getting transferred to run hardware, software and technical writing in
                            Manhattan. The morning of 9/11, Vicky was working in Manhattan near
                            Trinity Church, sitting on a bench outside doing paperwork. She heard a
                            muffled crash and a turbine engine winding down. Watching people looking
                            up, Vicky walked over and saw the plume of debris coming from the World
                            Trade Center. She saw paper on the ground, the edges were burnt and it
                            smelt like diesel fuel. Vicky heard on the radio that a second plane had
                            hit tower 2 and she started walking towards the towers to make sure the
                            clerks were out of the booths. She was able to get the clerks out of the
                            booth and check in with her shop, who told her to go back up to Wall
                            Street. While she was walking uptown, she saw lights flash and she
                            thought it was an advanced shock wave of a bomb, next thing she knew
                            Vicky was running down stairs to get away from the cloud of debris that
                            was funneling toward her. At the bottom of the stairs she was banging on
                            a locked door and a hairdresser let her in. Shortly after when the dust
                            was settled a bit, Vicky went back out into the streets, she saw three
                            cops walking towards her covered in dust and debris, she was able to get
                            them into the hair shop and they were able to clean their faces. Once
                            they were all ok, they went back out into the streets and she remembers
                            it being like Nuclear winter, everything was white and quiet. Vicky
                            remembers walking around a lot that afternoon, going into a church to
                            get cleaned up and just needing to get back to her shop. Once she
                            arrived there, she signed up for a double shift to repair the metro card
                            machines. Transit was allowing passengers to ride for free and she
                            remembers no one wanted to walk through the open gates, people were too
                            used to paying. She remembers the unity of the people, how everyone came
                            together to help one another. The feeling of camaraderie and how
                            everyone was acting selflessly. She had no fear for herself, Vicky just
                            wanted to help who she could and everyone came together that day. Vicky
                            still works for Transit, dealing with a lot of ups and downs after the
                            attacks. The one thing Vicky would like to come out of her story is
                            human nature. How everyone cooperated and helped one another. It showed
                            such a beautiful side of human nature and commonality. She wishes that
                            good positive side of human nature was shown everyday by people. Vicky
                            lives at home on Long Island with her fur babies.

       Seymour was born in 1926 and grew up in New York City. He grew up next to
                            a Fire house and was a runner for the Firemen, getting them their beer
                            and sandwiches. He knew all this life that he wanted to be a Fireman and
                            thought that he was put on this Earth for a purpose. He believed he got
                            his warm heart from his mother, who always took care of everyone.
                            Seymour joined the Navy in 1943 during WWII as a gunner on a torpedo
                            bomber in the South Pacific. After spending time being stationed in
                            Hawaii, Seymour knew it was time to come home. In 1952, he became a New
                            York City Fireman. He was stationed in Brownsville, Engine 231 Watkins
                            Street, which was rated at the time, the worst firehouse in the world
                            for the number of fires responded to. They were called to as many as 35
                            fires a night, but the men loved what they did. He helped deliver two
                            babies and saved countless people’s lives. While he was in the FDNY he
                            drove a Chief, so he got to know a lot of the Firemen across NYC and the
                            boroughs. Seymour also worked 3 jobs at the time, including being a
                            fireman, an exterminator and an air conditioner repair man. The
                            exterminator business stuck and his son still runs that business till
                            this day. Seymour retired from FDNY in 1989 and moved down to Florida
                            for a brief time before coming back up to New York. Now Seymour helps
                            take care of people within his community by bringing them to the doctors
                            and to other appointments, giving him a sense of purpose well into his
                            90s. The morning of 9/11, his wife Shelia told him about a plane hitting
                            the tower so they turned on the TV. They watched the second plane hit
                            and he knew that this was an attack on American soil. He told his wife
                            that he was going in and headed into the city and at his age, he didn’t
                            think twice. So at 75 years old, he traveled into his old station in
                            Brownsville and reported down to Ground Zero. Once he arrived downtown
                            at Ground Zero his mindset went from anger to the need to find a body,
                            the need to find something. While down at the pit, Seymour wanted to
                            work but with his age and knowledge of the city, they teamed him up with
                            an FBI agent named Debby and they went around looking for plane parts,
                            which they found multiple affects. The FBI was staged at Chamber Street,
                            so they brought whatever they found over to them. When he wasn’t working
                            with the FBI, he helped with the bucket brigade, sleeping downtown 2
                            nights on then head back home for a day before turning around and going
                            right back. Seymour worked down at Ground Zero about 10 days recalling
                            the unity and bond that responders and civilians were sharing. He
                            recalls how close firemen are and how they were able to continue on,
                            working for months because they had to. One of Seymour’s grandchildren,
                            Robbie, joined the service and followed in his grandfather’s footsteps.
                            He served in Afghanistan and received multiple medals for his heroism.
                            He now works as a Suffolk County Police Officer, continuing the family
                            line of service to the community. Though Seymour and his family have
                            given a lot to their communities, they are a very proud family of their
                            service and the need to help others. Although Seymour may never come to
                            peace with 9/11, he recalls how he never came to peace with flying over
                            Pearl Harbor and seeing the Arizona fuel still leaking into the harbor.
                            He never was able to forgive the Japanese for Pearl Harbor and he will
                            never be able to forgive the people that orchestrated and carried out
                            the attacks on 9/11.

       Chris is from Fairfield Connecticut. He was born in 1960. His family
                            owned a trucking business for one-hundred years in Bridgeport. Chris
                            went to college in the eighties. While attending college Chris was a
                            part of a band and did a nine country tour through Europe. He has two
                            sisters who are both working in the healthcare field. Chris went to
                            Central Connecticut State University where he earned his biology degree.
                            A friend of Chris’s sent him a catalogue about a chiropractic degree
                            from one of Oregon’s leading universities. Chris pursued this career
                            path and became a chiropractor. A week before the events of 9/11 had
                            occurred, Chris went into New York City but didn’t have enough time to
                            visit the Twin Towers. On the day of 9/11, Chris heard the news on the
                            radio while he was heading to work. At first, Chris thought it was an
                            accident. It wasn’t until he saw the second plane hit the other Tower on
                            the news that he knew something serious had occurred. Chris went down
                            two days after 9/11 and was overwhelmed by the devastation. He discussed
                            how the streets around the area were very desolate and all you could
                            hear were sirens and firetrucks. When Chris was walking down Canal
                            Street there was a debris cloud overhead and there was a distinct smell
                            like a stale campfire surrounding the area. A friend of Chris’s notified
                            him that chiropractors were being sent to St. Paul’s Chapel to do relief
                            work. There were two chiropractors working per shift. In order to get to
                            the site there were police checkpoints. At these checkpoints Chris had
                            to show proper ID, and the police searched his car as part of the
                            security measures. Chris arrived to St. Paul’s Chapel and noticed that
                            it was untouched. However, the building next door had its windows blown
                            out from the event. When Chris was at the Chapel a lot of people didn’t
                            know that chiropractors were there. While Chris was working at the site
                            he had heard stories about the Mob hijacking debris trucks in order to
                            make a profit off of the debris especially steal. Chris had numerous
                            stories about how many people were able to relax and breakdown after the
                            chiropractors and massage therapists had treated them. As the clean-up
                            crews were removing the debris Chris noticed that many of the bodies
                            were fused to their seats. A friend of Chris’s who was living across
                            from the Verizon Building saw people jump to avoid from being burned to
                            death. While at St. Paul’s Chapel there was music playing to ease and
                            calm down people there. St. Pauls was the only place where people who
                            working continuously had a place to sleep and rest. Chris was very
                            motivated to help with the aftermath of 9/11. He worked at the site from
                            October 4, 2001 till June.

       Greg grew up on the North Shore of Long Island in Kings Park. His father
                            was a Navy commander and later worked on the New York Stock Exchange.
                            Growing up in a large Irish family with 5 siblings, they spent a lot of
                            time on the water fishing. Greg has four children, 2 girls with his
                            first wife and 2 sons with his second wife and have 4 grandchildren.
                            Greg owned a repair shop with his brother on Long Island and after they
                            decided to close down the shop, his brother went into the Ironworkers
                            union and Greg began working for Century Petroleum in Manhattan working
                            on construction equipment. The morning of 9/11, Greg had only been
                            working in the city for a year. He worked with heavy construction
                            equipment, which had a contract with Con Edison to fuel their needs.
                            While standing on the Williamsburg Bridge they could see the fire
                            billowing from Tower 1. They couldn’t see the second plane hit Tower 2
                            but they could see it come out the other side. Right after they got the
                            call to get all trucks off the bridge and head back to the yard to get
                            ready to start fueling Emergency equipment when the call came in. Greg,
                            along with his coworkers, watched both towers fall and he remembers they
                            went down in the blink of an eye. The morning after they went downtown
                            to start filling the fuel for the emergency machines. The feeling of
                            disbelief, bewilderment and anger overcame them. When first seeing the
                            site, it was gut wrenching so they focused on getting the job done. They
                            spent the first couple of days just cycling through the big generators
                            making sure they were fueled. Greg spent 21 days down at Ground Zero
                            before he finally went home. Con Edison needed to provide power to the
                            buildings in lower Manhattan, which had them laying power lines in the
                            street. Keeping these power lines up and running was one of the most
                            important fueling projects they had while being tasked downtown. Another
                            big project that had to be taken care of was making sure that the slurry
                            wall, which was holding back the Hudson River, didn’t cave in and
                            completely flood the Ground Zero site. Greg and his team worked around
                            the clock to make sure that all the machines that were involved in the
                            multiple projects going on at once downtown were fueled and running.
                            Another large concern was making sure that Wall Street, Mercantile
                            Exchange and Cantor Fitzgerald stayed up and running. Greg made sure
                            that one of his fueling trucks was parked on Wall Street 24/7, allowing
                            them to refuel the generators when needed to keep those companies up and
                            running. Greg worked at the World Trade Center site until November 26,
                            2014. He watched the entire transition from recovery, to clean-up, to
                            the rebuild. Greg and his team of drivers were the life blood of keeping
                            everything working and running via fuel, day in and day out. Everyone
                            down at the World Trade Center sites became one big family, always
                            helping one another when they needed it, no questions asked. He
                            recognized the comradery that brought everyone together. One of the
                            biggest things that Greg wants people to know is that he never wants to
                            see this type of thing happen again. He’s worried about his children and
                            grandchildren living in a world where they’re waiting for something like
                            this to happen again. Greg is now retired and living in Delaware with
                            his wife Abby.

       Every story holds a new piece to the puzzle and Stan is one of those
                            missing pieces. For him, 9/11 is a time of loss like so many others but
                            it’s also a time of questions. Before that dreaded day though, let’s
                            back up to happier times. Stan grew up in East Meadow, which is located
                            on Long Island with his twin brother along with two brothers and two
                            sisters as well. They all lived that typical American life in the 60’s
                            and 70’s of loving families, athletic fun, and laughter in the
                            household. In 1973, Stan’s family moved to South Florida where Stan
                            attended the local college but soon moved back up to Long Island with
                            his grandparents, as Florida wasn’t for him. He soon became involved
                            with the Fire Department through his uncle with whom he worked for. Said
                            Uncle whom was also a fireman told him to take the test, so in between
                            working at his other uncles deli and the construction business he took
                            the physical and test for the department. On January 10th of 81 he was
                            hired and was placed in 90 Engine in the Bronx during Probie School. As
                            most firemen say “Welcome to the life you love” that’s exactly what
                            happened to Stan. He loved everything about being a firefighter. From
                            being transferred to Brooklyn which was a busy area until he was
                            transferred over in August of 91, every single second he loved his job.
                            That August, he was given order to go and cover Hazmat, which is the
                            hazardous waste products firehouse unit. Following his transfer, he
                            would stay in that firehouse until he retired, working with the Chief of
                            HAZMAT Operations Jack Fanning until the day Chief Fanning passed away.
                            On 9/11, Stan had just completed his 20th year on the job and had
                            decided that he was going to go on for 25 years, as his kids would have
                            finished college by the time that he would be out. On that tragic day,
                            he still remembers the clear blue sky as he reported in for his shift at
                            Randall’s Island, which the firefighters located, there nicknamed “Hells
                            Gate.” Upon his arrival at the firehouse, he overheard on the radio the
                            broadcasters questioning what had happened. So, Chief Fanning and Stan
                            responded in to check it out. Before they left the house, they told
                            their crew to stay behind, as they had no idea what they were responding
                            to yet. One major point that Stan emphasized was that Chief Fanning
                            wanted to drive because he had his gear in his car. As they drove across
                            the Triborough Bridge and down the FDR, they saw the second explosion.
                            Stan describes it as a bubble but a fire bubble. At the time they didn’t
                            know that the second plane had hit the South Tower. Upon arriving at
                            Vesey Street and truly viewing the scene, Stan turns to Chief Fanning
                            and goes “ It’s going to be a long day” All around him, it was lot to
                            take it from the burning towers above, to the people running away from
                            the towers to the first responders rushing in. You would see one
                            firefighter and the next moment they would be gone and that’s exactly
                            what happened to chief fanning. Stan and Chief Fanning got separated and
                            unfortunately that drive to the Trade Center would be their last drive
                            together. As Stan tried to look for Chief Fanning, he ran into other
                            chiefs and firefighters who were asking him questions and giving him
                            directions. But for Stan what truly stuck out was when firefighters
                            asked him “ What do you want me to do?” He felt so useless at that time
                            when the firefighters asked him that because he didn’t know what they
                            should do at all. As the time clock for the towers slowly was ticking
                            down, Stan headed back in the direction of the Towers to see if he could
                            a. Find Chief Fanning and b. See if he could do anything. The only
                            reason why Stan didn’t rush into the tower in the first place was
                            because he didn’t have his bunker gear with him leaving him outside the
                            towers hearing the bodies of those trapped above jump to their deaths.
                            Now as he recalls it years later, right before the tower fell, more and
                            more bodies seemed to be hitting the ground before the mushroom tunnel
                            began which the last attempt for those trapped. As he looked above when
                            the sound of the crash began and saw the “mushroom tunnel” coming for
                            him, he sprinted for the World Financial Center. At first he couldn’t
                            open the glass doors because the pressure was so great from what was
                            coming on above, but finally he able to pry it open with both hands and
                            make it inside. Due to the force of the collapse, like so many of the
                            buildings on the site, all of the glass windows were completely blown
                            out which sent Stan flying into a wall. When he finally came to, he
                            thought he was dead because he was in total darkness. The only thing
                            that kept him sane was that there was a red light flashing indicating he
                            was in the basement. As he got up and started walking around, he heard a
                            voice calling for 217, and it happened to be the lieutenant of the house
                            Tom McGuff searching for his guys. Unfortunately, he couldn’t find any
                            of them, but he did find Stan. Finding his way out of the center, his
                            main focus became finding survivors, whether it is civilians or first
                            responders. But, he didn’t find any. Fortunately for him, his crew
                            finally arrived with his bunker gear giving him more protection as the
                            North Tower was due to collapse any moment. When the rumbling started
                            again, he started running but was pulled behind a concrete wall by
                            Charlie Wells who had a breathing mask which came in handy as to Stan,
                            the second collapse seemed to be a lot hotter then the first. Following
                            both towers falling, Stan realized how hard he was thrown into the wall
                            when his head began pounding and the adrenaline rush wore off. Finally
                            receiving treatment and care, he began to process what truly just
                            happened. With the realization of what happened, Stan and the FEMA team
                            along with the rest of the Hazmat unit set up their emergency unit at
                            the school across the street from Ground Zero. For the next few weeks,
                            this is all Stan would know. Besides seeing “The Pile” as the remnants
                            of the World Trade Center became known to be, Stan also unfortunately
                            saw funerals for those next few months of his life as well. 19 guys from
                            his firehouses that he previously bounced around in before Hazmat had
                            been killed but his Chief and friend Jack Fanning had been killed as
                            well. With 343 firefighters killed, there were at least 2-3 funerals a
                            day once the bodies were found. The widows and families either planned
                            the funerals with the departments or with other families based on
                            friendships and relationships, so not only the exhaustion from working
                            on the pile overcame those still alive but burying those lost added onto
                            the grief as well. We look at Stan’s story 15 years later as a lesson,
                            especially from someone who went through it all. But for Stan who still
                            grieves for those lost, the questions of the unknown still linger on his
                            mind. If all he could get are answers then he will feel more at peace.
                            Especially for him, he needs to know that no one will ever forget.

       Michael “Mike” grew up on Long Island in Massapequa. He grew up with 2
                            older siblings and still lives in that same town with his wife and
                            daughter. Mike’s grandfather and uncle were New York City police
                            officers and he knew he always wanted to follow in their footsteps,
                            becoming the 3rd generation in the NYPD. He joined the force in the
                            1980s, during the height of organized crime in New York City. Lead to a
                            very exciting and fast paced job. Mike started workings with the
                            Narcotics division, eventually becoming Captain for Organized Crime. The
                            morning of 9/11, Mike was on his way into his command at the Brooklyn
                            Army Terminal. His boss called him while he was driving and told him
                            that a plane had hit Tower 1, shortly after he received the call that
                            the tower fell. As soon as he arrived he put his Captain’s hat on and
                            started to formulate a response team and plan. He recalls it being mass
                            chaos, with officers showing up who were self-activating. Mike put
                            together a plan for 50-70 officers, all from different commands and put
                            some of them on a boat to head over to downtown Manhattan. Mike led the
                            rest of the officers over to the city and immediately went into rescue
                            mode by the time they reached the World Trade Center. They were all
                            downtown once the towers fell and it was controlled chaos and a surreal
                            experience. Mike was then placed in charge of 60-70 cops, with 4 to 6
                            stories high of rubble they began to formulate a strategy to rescue
                            people. He was amazed at how brave all the police officers and fire
                            fighters were that took it upon themselves to help, even though they
                            weren’t required to or being paid to. Mike spent the first few days
                            organizing the cops and fire fighters coming in on their own time,
                            giving them tasks to do, not wanting them to get hurt. After the first
                            few days, Mike went back to his headquarters and came up with a plan and
                            set up a detail for Ground Zero. He set up his command center downtown
                            at the High School, creating two 12 hour shifts for working. There was
                            about 500-700 cops that reported per shift and Mike lived downtown, at
                            various places, for a total of 54 days before going back home. They
                            realized after a couple weeks they weren’t going to be able to find any
                            survivors and the objective turned to the recovery of body parts. The
                            events on 9/11 changed Michael’s professional career for the rest of his
                            life. Once he was able to go home, he wrote a white paper, outlining how
                            they needed to retrain their city officers in Counter Terrorism. Which
                            then pushed his career into being the Inspector of the Counter Terrorism
                            Unit of the NYPD for the 7 years following. He’s gone all over the world
                            to train people in how to be an active member of society and to be ready
                            for when another attack happens. Mike wants people to know to always let
                            law enforcement know if you have a bad feeling about someone or
                            something. Think about what you’d do in that situation if you knew you
                            were going to die? Would you help the cause or would you stay silent and
                            possibly let something happen. Michael retired from the NYPD in 2009 and
                            started working for a private security firm that also deals with
                            terrorism. He chose to step away from the force when he realized his
                            daughter was growing up too fast in front of his eyes.

       John grew up in Middle Village which is located in Queens. In John’s
                            community everyone is close to one another. John experienced a
                            traditional type of an Irish-Italian lifestyle. His Father was a funeral
                            director and later became a deacon in a Catholic church while John’s
                            Mother was a stay at home mom. John has three boys and is married to his
                            wife Sheila. Religion is very important to John. John attended a
                            religious high school in Brooklyn called the Most Holy Trinity and later
                            went to earn his college degree at St. Johns University and his master’s
                            degree at Iona College. John’s first career was being an accountant but
                            then he got tired of dealing with the numbers associated with the job
                            that he switched his field to healthcare administration. John was
                            working at the Floating Hospital as a controller on the day of 9/11.
                            John’s main job while working at the Floating Hospital was to be in
                            charge of the flow of money and to track business expenses. John suffers
                            from Crohn’s Disease. When the events of 9/11 occurred it was his first
                            day back on the job because his doctor had asked him to take a couple of
                            days off. John got off of the M-train and realized that smoke was coming
                            from the tower. At first, John thought it was an accident due to a plane
                            malfunctioning. While John was at the Floating Hospital an explosion of
                            some sort rocked the gangway of the boat. John didn’t know that it was
                            the second plane hitting the tower that caused this type of eruption. A
                            worker saw the incident on the television and then told John of the
                            news. John was very critical of the role the Floating Hospital played
                            during this chaotic time. The Floating Hospital was at the center of the
                            catastrophe. People were running away from the incident and heading
                            towards the pier. John wanted the Floating Hospital to put up the
                            gangway this way people could run onto the boat and start rescuing
                            people from the devastation. However, people shut this proposition of
                            John’s down and the Floating Hospital closed its doors. The reason this
                            plan of John’s got shutdown was due to insurance liability issues. The
                            workers left the boat and headed uptown. John walked the FDR drive and
                            noticed the eeriness of the place. In addition, John walked down Fifth
                            Avenue and saw the smoke and realized at this moment that he was living
                            a part of history. John tasted the dust from the towers falling. John
                            finally got into contact with a bunch of family members who were also in
                            the City during this time. John and his family arranged to meet at his
                            Brother-in-Law’s office in order to travel home. While John and his
                            family members were traveling home through the tunnel, John noticed that
                            his car was the only one on the road at this time. After the event, John
                            suffers from lung damage and having vivid recollections of 9/11 within
                            his dreams. Many people within John’s community worked in the City and
                            pasted away during 9/11. John stated that many of his neighbors became
                            closer due to this event. During the time of the 9/11 anniversary the
                            Middle Village Park holds a vigil for the people taken away in 9/11. On
                            the other hand, the Floating Hospital was moved to a different pier
                            location following 9/11 and John believed this had occurred because of
                            the Floating Hospitals actions during 9/11. John believes that 9/11
                            should be a day of remembrance.

       In this video, Brian shares his experiences as a veterinarian responding
                            to 9/11 to support the search and rescue (SAR) dogs. Brian, a
                            veterinarian on Long Island, was called to respond to the 9/11 disaster
                            due to his affiliation with the SPCA and voluntary association with
                            their local emergency response unit. From his explanation, this team is
                            comprised of veterinarians, vet techs, and other animal professionals
                            who respond to emergency situations to help and support other responders
                            when dealing with injured or lost animals, as well as to assist and
                            support animals working with responders, such as the SAR dogs. Following
                            his story of responding to 9/11, he talks about the uncertainty of
                            traveling to Manhattan from Long Island following the disaster on 9/13,
                            the chaos he and his colleagues found at Ground Zero, and how his role
                            changed from not only providing medical support for the SAR dogs, but
                            also to supporting and aiding their handlers and, eventually,
                            firefighters as well. As he explains, the SPCA set up aid stations for
                            the SAR dogs to be checked over by veterinarians, as well as to wash
                            them (especially their eyes and feet), which eventually extended to
                            include SAR handlers and firefighters using the eyewash stations as
                            well. This experience brought him into more contact with responders
                            working the pile and surrounding area. Through this experience he also
                            gives examples of the uncertainty in action, for example being told to
                            keep an eye out for signs of biological warfare, or the lack of
                            information about what was specifically happening on the pile at a given
                            time. Later, he talks about the aftermath of 9/11 on himself, and his
                            coworkers who went with him to the site, as well as how his family has
                            responded to the event after the fact (especially his children). For
                            example, his daughter encouraged him to participate in the oral history
                            interview process because his experiences and story were, in her
                            approximation, important to share with others. Alternatively, one of his
                            colleagues who went with him to the site all but refuses to discuss it,
                            and has experienced more negative outcomes from the event. He shares how
                            this has changed his working relationship over time, and how he has
                            worked to try and help his colleague. Content is presented in a detailed
                            and easy to follow manner, presents a relatively hopeful message for the
                            future, and is free of bad language, making it very accessible to
                            viewers of most ages and sensibilities.
