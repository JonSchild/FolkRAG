       Interview location: Emilio Díaz Valcárcel Municipal Library of Trujillo
                            Alto. Elba discusses her experiences with her family around the time of
                            the disaster. She lists damage to her home and her future music school
                            for cuatro guitar. She also describes the destruction she saw in her
                            hometown of Utuado, where she traveled to after the hurricane passed.
                            She mentions rural people like her adapted better to the post-hurricane
                            conditions than did the rest of Puerto Rico. She discusses the
                            importance of spirtual music in lifting people's moods after tragedy and
                            disaster. She gives an overview of the cuatro guitar tradition and its
                            role in Christmas songs and rural spirituality. At various points in the
                            interview she criticizes Puerto Rican's lack of preparedness and the
                            influence of modern culture. She wishes the public were more in tune
                            with nature. She has harsh words for the current Puerto Rican government
                            and its austerity policies. She discusses her work for an indigenous
                            rights society she founded (Consejo General de Taínos Borincanos). She
                            decries social and economic inequality in Puerto Rico and states the
                            hurricane was a God sent event to teach Puerto Ricans to learn how to
                            use nature's bounty and their old traditions to take care of their own
                            selves. She speaks favorably to environmentalism and social activism.
                            Elba names a song, "Oubao Moin" by Puerto Rican folk musician Roy Brown,
                            that hopes and celebrates the different Puerto Rican peoples coming
                            together and working to preserve the island’s nature and unique
                            identity. Additional notes: Elba Lugo is a Taíno indigenous rights
                            activist, as well as a cuatro guitar player and teacher. She lives in
                            Trujillo Alto. In September 8, 2018 she will be in New York City at the
                            American Indian Museum Heye Center to talk about the Taíno movement.

       Interview location: Dr. Carlos Hernández Library, Carolina. Javier
                            discusses the damage the hurricane did to his property. He recounts
                            helping neighbors clear out debris. He describes how his active
                            disposition helped him overcome the discomfort of not having access to
                            water or electricity. Javier explains playing music on his guitar with
                            the local church to lift spirits up, including traveling around his
                            neighborhood (Santa Cruz) with the church musicians playing at people's
                            doorsteps. Javier goes over how the disaster limited his time and
                            ability to paint. Javier also mentions he makes wooden frames for a
                            family business in Bayamón. He gives some thought unto how the hurricane
                            led to him working with smaller canvasses and focusing more on birds as
                            subjects. Additional notes: Javier Alzerreca is a painter living in
                            Carolina. He also homeschools his three daughters and two sons along
                            with his wife.

       Interview location: Centro Communal de la Quinta Extención de Villa
                            Carolina, Carolina. Anonymous interviewee talks about being able to make four dresses in
                            the style of Taíno Indians thanks to her neighbor’s generator. These
                            dresses were a commission from a school unable to purchase the product
                            in stores following the hurricane and needing it for an event on
                            cultural awareness. Anonymous interviewee describes her neighborhood's
                            struggle after the hurricane as well as leaving for the U.S. mainland.
                            She tells how the Carolina government for months cancelled the
                            clothes-making classes she held at the local community center. She
                            discusses the situation in Loíza, Puerto Rico, before and after the
                            hurricane. She compliments the work of the new Loíza mayor in promoting
                            cultural events. She is critical of the Puerto Rican and U.S. federal
                            government response to the disaster. She sees the response as clueless
                            and inefficient. She also criticizes the Puerto Rican Junta, a federally
                            created oversight board meant to fix Puerto Rico’s debt problem, for its
                            fiscal control and austerity measures. She discusses discrimination in
                            Puerto Rico towards black people and other marginalized groups. She
                            tells the story of a local black girl discriminated against by her
                            school in a bullying case. She emphasizes the importance of the Turban
                            in black women's fashion, but laments its limited use by Puerto Ricans.
                            She tells stories of people fetishizing or being puzzled by her and
                            other Puerto Rican black women's dress and appearance. She also includes
                            a story about making a dress for a young lady that goes on to win a
                            local fashion contest. Additional notes: The anonymous interviewee is a
                            clothes maker who specializes in Ghanan attire for women. She is also a
                            racial activist on behalf of Puerto Rico's black community. The

       Interview location: El Batey de los Hermanos Ayala, Loíza. Raúl discusses
                            flooding and water damage in his home caused by Hurricane Maria. He
                            describes the damage to El Batey, specifically the workshop from which
                            he sells masks and his sister's house, which is part of El Batey. He
                            explains how local mayors are helping rebuild the workshop. A phone call
                            interrupts and stops the interview six minutes in. Additional notes:
                            Raúl Ayala is a retired economist and the son of Castor Ayala, famous
                            mask maker and musician from Loíza. Raúl still operates out of his
                            father's workshop making masks like his father did.

       Interview location: El Batey de los Hermanos Ayala, Loíza. Raúl says he
                            is working on dozens of masks for when the workshop, from which he sells
                            them, reopens. He discusses the scarcity of coconuts, which used to make
                            the masks, in the island. He also talks about the current the demand for
                            his masks, whose supply is lacking, and how that affects his work. Raúl
                            makes some critical remarks about the inconsistent and inefficient work
                            of FEMA. Raúl talks about the enthusiasm for the coming yearly Festival
                            Santiago Apóstol of Loíza. He explains some of the characters people
                            dress up as for the festival and what each represents. Heavy rain and
                            wind forces open the doors of the rebuilt workshop, which is where the
                            interview is taking place, interrupting it at 20:30. Raúl assures that
                            the people of Loíza will be fine, and expresses gratefulness for all the
                            help they have received. Additional notes: Raúl Ayala is a retired
                            economist and the son of Castor Ayala, famous mask maker and musician
                            from Loíza. Raúl still operates out of his father's workshop making

       Interview location: Carolina, Carlos' home. Carlos describes the damage
                            to his property and the suffering from stress due to Hurricane Maria. He
                            explains the distinction between people who participate in cockfights
                            for a living and those who simply do it to entertain themselves. He goes
                            over the damage the hurricane inflicted to his birdcages and breeding
                            grounds. He explains some of the changes he has made to his pen for
                            raising fighting roosters. Carlos briefly addresses and gives his
                            opinion on the interactions between Puerto Ricans and FEMA. Additional
                            notes: Carlos Rojas lives in the municipality of Carolina working as a
                            paint salesman. He breeds and raises cockfighting roosters as a
                            hobby.

       Interview location: José's home in the neighborhood of Martorell,
                            Yabucoa. José, also known as Toco, recounts how he and his brother
                            started breeding and raising roosters, following in the footsteps of
                            their father. Toco talks about the extent of his interest in the sport.
                            He lists some of the places throughout the island where he likes to
                            attend cockfights. He mentions having taught local kids about
                            cockfighting and selling them young chickens and roosters for them to
                            entertain themselves with. Toco says as long as Puerto Rico doesn't
                            become the fifty-first state, there will always be cockfighting in
                            Puerto Rico. Additional notes: José Román, more commonly known by his
                            nickname Toco, works as a handyman in Yabucoa. He also breeds fighting
                            roosters along the street he lives in.

       Interview location: In the backyard of David's home in the neighborhood
                            of Martorell, Yabucoa. Throughout the interview, one can hear David's
                            roosters loudly crowing. David describes the destruction he witnessed in
                            his neighborhood and people cleaning up the streets afterwards. David
                            talks about a childhood friend he shared his cockfighting hobby with. He
                            explains how they helped each other out during Hurricane Maria’s
                            aftermath and how they take care of each other's birds when they are
                            away from home. He goes over the damage to his breeding set-up, or
                            rancho, which consists of a wire and zinc plating structure where young
                            birds are kept and mated. He explains how he learned about cockfighting
                            as a child by attending cockfighting arenas and assisting in the
                            preparation that takes place before cockfights. He discusses government
                            attempts to make cockfighting illegal in Puerto Rico. Additional notes:
                            David Sostre Rivera lives in Yabucoa. He breeds and raises cockfighting
                            birds in his property as a hobby.

       This interview takes place while both Kike elder and the younger Kike
                            give me a tour of their property. Most of the interview is filled with
                            the noise of shrieking birds. They start off explaining the purpose of
                            keeping certain birds in cages as opposed to roaming free. They give an
                            overview of why they raise the types of birds they keep. They go over
                            breeding, the culinary uses of guinea fowls, and "padrotes," or roosters
                            kept alive through old age for breeding. Additional notes: José E.
                            Santiago lives by the hills in Martorell, Yabucoa with his son, also
                            named José (Santiago Vásquez). They go by the same nickname as well,
                            Kike, although the elder calls the younger "Kikito." Son and father live
                            in the same property, which consists of two small houses and whatever
                            they can salvage from the steep surrounding land. They raise birds
                            amongst other occupations. They make money off of breeding cockfighting
                            birds, and occasionally gambling on fights.

       After a brief interruption, father and son showcase their two pigs, kept
                            for christmas dinner. They explain young roosters are kept in cages due
                            to their uncontrollable aggressiveness. At one point the elder kike
                            takes a young rooster out of a cage, opens another cage containing a
                            separate rooster, and, holding one rooster in his arms, thrusts it
                            towards the caged rooster. Both roosters' plumage flares and they swipe
                            at each other with their spurs and beaks. This demonstration is meant to
                            show the turn to aggression when two young roosters come near each
                            other. Later on, the two of them walk through where they keep their
                            adult fighting roosters. They explain and give demonstrations of the
                            training techniques and tools they use on roosters. They also show and
                            explain how roosters were trained before the advent of some of these
                            tools. The two also discuss how the metrics of cockfights, the length
                            and frequency of fights, affects how their roosters are trained and
                            kept. The two discuss the importance of an effective fighting rooster in
                            breeding for superior cockfighting birds, as well as a chicken’s role in
                            the transference of genes. Elder kike shows how they label their
                            chickens with a tag to keep track of them. Father and son say interest
                            and expertise in cockfighting came to them from their childhood
                            experiences. They describe cockfighting as part of Puerto Rico's
                            idiosyncrasies. They also discuss how both the rich and poor gamble in
                            cockfighting at their corresponding price ranges. The interviewer
                            recounts going to a cockfighting arena in Yabucoa. The discussion turns
                            to the state of Puerto Rico's cockfighting venues. They discuss taxation
                            and the cockfighting federation. Younger kike describes the destruction
                            Hurricane Maria brought to their property. Younger kike shows and talks
                            about their horse. He also discusses the importance of having faith when
                            recovering from disasters like the hurricane. Additional notes: José E.
                            Santiago lives by the hills in Martorell, Yabucoa with his son, also
                            named José (Santiago Vásquez). They go by the same nickname as well,
                            Kike, although the elder calls the younger "Kikito." Son and father live
                            in the same property, which consists of two small houses and whatever
                            they can salvage from the steep surrounding land. They raise birds
                            amongst other occupations. They make money off of breeding cockfighting
                            birds, and occasionally gambling on fights.

                        my cellphone (Camera on LG Android Phone (VS835). The photos were mostly of
                        poor quality in both their resolution and how well they were taken.
                        Nevertheless, I think they are quite usable, especially those of
