   <p>
    The Maine Acadian Cultural Survey Project was conducted in 1991 as a joint project of
            the American Folklife Center and the North Atlantic Regional Office of the National Park
            Service. In 1990 the U.S. Congress passed the Maine Acadian Culture Preservation Act
            (P.L.101-543), mandating that a study of Acadian culture in Maine be conducted for the
            purpose of providing data to be used in planning an Acadian Cultural Center in Maine. As
            a result of this act, the Park Service invited the Center to join them in undertaking
            such a study. The Maine Acadian Cultural Survey Project is the fifth major collaborative
            project between the Park Service and the Center, and the design and execution of the
            project were largely based on knowledge gained through earlier projects.
   </p>
   <p>
    Under the terms of the cooperative agreement between the Park Service and the Center,
            the Center developed and administered a study of Acadian culture in Maine, produced a
            draft report with findings of the study and recommendations for future research and
            cultural programming, and provided the Park Service with a reference copy of the field
            data.
   </p>
   <p>
    Eight weeks of field research by five researchers, interviewing residents and
            documenting aspects of traditional culture in context, in the St. John Valley yielded an
            ethnographic collection consisting of 5,081 photographic images, 3,600 pages of print
            materials, fieldnotes, manuscripts and catalogs, 42 computer discs, 40 hours of audio
            recordings, 50 pages of sketches, and an assortment of ephemeral material. These data
            were used to compile a 199-page report, titled
    <title>
     <part>
      <emph render="italic">
       The Maine Acadian Cultural Survey
      </emph>
     </part>
    </title>
    , that was submitted to the National Park Service. The report contains the
            findings of the survey of Acadian culture in Maine as well as recommendations for the
            development of a Maine Acadian Cultural Center. Following a review by National Park
            Service officials, the report was published by the Park Service and submitted to
            Congress, and is expected to be used as a planning document by the Maine Acadian Culture
            Preservation Commission.
   </p>
   <p>
    The ethnographic collection of the project has been added to the Archive of Folk
            Culture, Library of Congress. A reference copy of the collection was donated to the
            Archive acadiennes at the University of Maine at Fort Kent, where it is readily
            available to the residents of the study area.
   </p>
   <p>
    The project also proved to be a successful vehicle for creating or strengthening ties
            between the Center and cultural agencies and individual researchers in Maine. Project
            personnel worked closely with the Archives acadiennes, the Maine Arts Commission, the
            Maine Historic Preservation Commission, the Northeast Archives of Folklore and Oral
            History, and the University of Maine at Fort Kent. In addition, researchers had
            considerable contact with a large number of local historical societies and other
            cultural organizations based in the study area.

        1-7, Scenes from annual Fish River Canoe Race, taken near Fish River Falls
                        in Fort Kent, a portage for racers (frames #2 and 3 show the only racers
                        who, to my knowledge, shot the falls); 8, Trophies awarded to contestants in
                        the canoe race; 9-12, The Fort Kent Hotel on Main Street in downtown Fort
                        Kent; it no longer operates as a hotel, but does have an operating
                        restaurant (The Brass Lantern) and bar; one of two places in Fort Kent which
                        regularly feature live music; 13-15, Fieldworker Ray Brassieur examines
                        various pieces of a demolished barn in Eagle Lake, ME; the barn, which
                        belonged to Ethel Gagnon (who lived in a house on the property), was
                        estimated by her to be approximately 100 years old, and was partially
                        constructed of hewn timbers and square-cut nails; 16-17, Brassieur talks to
                        Ethel Gagnon at the back door of her house; 18, Outbuilding behind the
                        Gagnon house, which she called the "tool shed;" many of the residences in
                        the study area have one or more outbuildings, reflecting the agricultural
                        base of the original settlement; 19, View of the Gagnon house from the rear;
                        the addition which runs the length of the house is typical of the study
                        area, and often results from the enclosure of what was once an outdoor
                        "summer kitchen"; 20, Gagnon house and tool shed.

                        Gagnon property, located on land donated by the Gagnon family; as in many
                        parts of the country, there is widespread use of plastic flowers to decorate
                        graves; 9-14, Scenes inside the home of Ethel Gagnon; liberal use of family
                        pictures as a decorative element is found in the majority of homes in the
                        study area; 15, Ethel Gagnon's desk; the presence of the Catholic pamphlet
                        next to the budgetary calculations and the calculator hint at the importance
                        of Catholicism in the study area; 16, Calendar featuring the Pope's picture;
                        religious motifs often adorn the walls of houses; 17-18, Plate with wedding

                        but lamenting that there are few opportunities to play that part of his

                        the study area; religious statuary, such as that in frames #19-20, is

        These images document a visit with potato farmer Herman Deprey at his farm
                        in New Canada, ME, and a visit to the home of retired potato farmer Paul
                        Freeman in Wallagrass, ME; 1-3, Field coordinator Ray Brassieur talks with
                        Herman in on of the barns located on Herman's farm; 4-5, Herman's son Darcey
                        joins the conversation; 6, Door to the storage compartment for seed
                        potatoes, which are particularly susceptible to contamination, hence the
                        warning sign; 7-8, Potato barrels; Herman, like almost all farmers in the
                        study area, has abandoned the use of barrels in harvesting his crop, but
                        uses those he still has for storing other things (tools, trash, etc.); 9,
                        Herman's grandson Danny riding his all-terrain vehicle. These ATVs are quite
                        common in the study area, and are used for both pleasure riding and work;
                        Danny sometimes helps out around the farm with his, hitching up a small
                        trailer and clearing rocks out of the fields; 10, Newly planted potato
                        fields on Herman's farm; 11, The Deprey farmstead; the house is occupied by
                        Herman's father Mac and mother Blanche; 12, Barn on Paul Freeman's property
                        on State Highway 11 in Wallagrass, ME; the long curve of this barn's
                        roofline, which Freeman says he designed himself, is atypical; 13, Freeman's
                        house and barn; 14-15, Freeman's house, probably built in the late
                        nineteenth century; Freeman termed the construction madrier. which could
                        mean either log or plank. The proportions and roofline of this house are
                        quite typical of the study area, as is the outside cellar entrance. The
                        small arch over the front door, while not common, is found on houses
                        throughout the region; 16, Potato barrels in Freeman's barn; 17, Brassieur,
                        Herman Deprey, Paul Freeman, and Freeman's daughter Angela talk in one of
                        the doorways to the barn; 18, Doorway to the barn, with large tire chains on
                        the ground in front; 19-20, Interior detail of the roof of Freeman's barn;
                        while the absence of a ridgepole is typical, the continuous curve in which
                        the rafters are sawn is not. Also unusual is the horizontal sandwich
                        construction of the rafters.

        These images document the interior roof structure of Paul Freeman's barn on
                        State Highway 11, Wallagrass, ME. Freeman designed the barn himself; 1, Roof
                        supporting trusses, unusual in the length they run perpendicular to the
                        rafters; 2-7, Various photos of rafters and supports; see MAP-DW-C007 for
                        more information about rafters; 8, Basketball backboard and hoop on second
                        floor of barn; These images are of various buildings in Fort Kent, ME; 9,
                        Office of Eagle Oil in downtown Fort Kent. Eagles are a common decorative
                        motif in the study area. The Daigle family was one of the original Acadian
                        families to settle in the area, and Daigle remains one of the more common
                        names (French d'aiale translates as of the eaglet. See #12-13 below; 10, The
                        rear of some of the buildings on the south side of Main Street, downtown
                        Fort Kent (taken by Ray Brassieur); 11, House near downtown Fort Kent (taken
                        by Brassieur); 12-13, House with decorative eagles in the village of Daigle,
                        ME. This house is next to the store of Conrad Daigle, who is the only person
                        in the study area whom I heard say that there was a connection between such
                        eagles and the name Daigle; 14-16, Grave markers in the cemetery in Daigle.
                        Flowers and religious statuary are quite commonly used to decorate graves;
                        17, Looking toward the village of Daigle from the cemetery; These images
                        document structures in the Village Acadien, which has a National Register of
                        Historic Places designation as a collection of buildings, in Van Buren, ME.
                        All of the buildings have been moved to the site; 18-19, The Roy house, an
                        eighteenth century log house; this house was disassembled, moved to the
                        Village Acadien, and reassembled. However, it appears that the
                        reconstruction is not precise; the house was built using piece-sur-piece
                        logs with dovetail joinery, and the dovetails may have been sawn off during
                        disassembly; 20, The Morneault house, typical of mid-nineteenth century
                        houses of the study area; not visible is a small addition of the far side of
                        the house.

        These images document structures at the Village Acadien in Van Buren, ME;
                        1-2, Morneault house; small addition on the right side served as a post
                        office at one point; 3, Back of Morneault house; 4-5, Ouellette house, also
                        typical of nineteenth century construction; 6, Replica of nineteenth century
                        log church, Notre Dame de 1 'Assumption; 7, Sirois house; this style, with
                        the door in the gable end and a porch spanning the width of the house, seems
                        less common than that of the Morneault and Ouellette houses; 8-9, Restored
                        schoolhouse; 10, This small building was once a store and a barber shop;
                        11-12, Village Acadien; 13, Recently constructed museum/gallery; 14, Gift
                        shop; 15-16, Field coordinator Ray Brassieur talks with Albert Michaud of
                        Van Buren, who makes wooden birdhouses modelled after lighthouses; Michaud
                        sells the birdhouses in the parking lot of the Village Acadien; These images
                        document a visit to Roland Perrault at his home in Wallagrass, ME; 17-19,
                        Restored tractor (vintage unknown) belonging to Perrault; 20, Brassieur
                        talks to Perrault.

        These images document a house and barn on the property of Roland Perrault in
                        Wallagrass, ME; 1, Mr. Perrault (left) and field coordinator Ray Brassieur
                        (right) in front of Perrault's barn (identity of third person in center
                        unknown); 2, View of Perrault's barn from the northwest corner. The form of
                        this barn— relatively small, no side pens, and a simple gabled roof— was
                        probably used in barns constructed early in the French settlement of the
                        study area. However, the materials in this barn (e.g. millsawn lumber and
                        round machine-made nails) mark it as an early twentieth (or possibly late
                        nineteenth) century example; 3, View of the barn from the west side, towards
                        the main road (State Highway 11); the small window near the peak of the roof
                        would have been used for loading/unloading; 4, Sliding doors in the side of
                        the barn through which equipment and livestock could be moved; there is also
                        a set of doors in the opposite side, and arrangement common in the study
                        area; 5-6, Sliding mechanism on barn door; each door had four small iron
                        wheels, two per side, which rolled across the iron guide piece; 7, View of
                        barn from the southeast corner. Note the use of shakes on the bottom half of
                        this wall, which is on the side enclosing the livestock pen; the shakes were
                        used here due to their superior insulating qualities; 8, The rear portion of
                        the house, which is of late nineteenth century construction; the wide door
                        was used for a carriage. This attachment of a garage of sorts directly to
                        the house, using the same wall and roof lines, seems unusual; the garage was
                        converted to part of the living space of the house during a renovation. The
                        house is now owned by Mr. Perrault's daughter Phyllis, who uses it as a
                        part-time residence. 9 View up the hill to the north toward Mr. Perrault's
                        current residence; 10, Barn being re-shaked along State Highway 11 in
                        Wallagrass, ME. The shape and gambrel roof of this barn are typical of the
                        study area, but it is rare to find a barn sided entirely in shakes [The job
                        was finished and this section was painted to match the rest of the barn just
                        before we left the area in late July]; 11-16, An assortment of views from
                        State Highway 11 in Wallagrass, ME; a good portion of the land now in forest
                        was at one time agricultural; 17-19, Views of the Perrault house and barn
                        from State Highway 11; the long, narrow shape of the house is atypical; 20,
                        A twin barn in Frenchville, ME. Many variations of this type are found in
                        the study area; see MAP-DW-C011 for more photographs and information.

        These images document various structures observed while on a tour of the
                        study area conducted by Julie Bayly and Patrick Ouellette; 1-4, A twin barn
                        in Frenchville, ME. Several examples of this style, with its connected
                        simple gable roofs, exist in the study area; however, it is unusual for such
                        barns to have additions on two sides as this one does. Note the several wide
                        doorways; this barn is still being used for equipment storage; 5-7, A twin
                        barn in Hamlin, ME. Note the gambrel (locally termed colm-casse) roof,
                        which, while common in barns of the study area, is found less frequently in
                        twin barns than the simple gabled roof. It is currently not in use [This
                        barn burnt to the ground in July, 1991]; 8-10, Looking down the St. John
                        River from inside the Hamlin twin barn. The arched windows, used throughout
                        this barn (see also slides 5-7, 11-12, and 14-15 on this page) are an
                        unusual decorative feature; 11-12, Interior views of the Hamlin twin barn.
                        This fairly large barn was divided into several compartments; note the three
                        arched windows over the wide doorway, echoing those of the exterior wall;
                        13, Interior roof construction of Hamlin twin barn; this type of supporting
                        truss structure, although more elaborate in this barn, is commonly used in
                        the study area. Also typical is the absence of a ridgepole; 14-15, Side wall
                        of Hamlin twin barn; this is the exterior of the wall through which slides
                        8-10 were taken. The front (left) part of the barn was separated by a wall
                        from the rear, hence the side-by-side doorways; 16-18, The unoccupied house
                        across the road (U.S. Highway 1) from the Hamlin twin barn. We presume, but
                        do not know for certain, that the house and barn were (and may still be)
                        part of the same property. The form of the house is not uncommon; its size
                        and orientation, with the gabled side facing the road, suggest twentieth
                        century construction; 19-20, The Catholic church and cemetery in St-Basile,
                        New Brunswick. The white crosses toward the foreground represent the
                        founding families, the first Acadian settlers of the study area.

        These images document various scenes in New Brunswick, Canada; 1, Entrance
                        to the cemetery at the Catholic church in St. Basile; 2, Cemetery at St.
                        Basile? the building in the background was used to store bodies in the
                        winter, when the ground was too frozen to dig graves; 3, Three Feathers gift
                        shop on the Malecite reserve in Iroquois, New Brunswick, just east of
                        Edmunston. Note the totem pole, an artifact generally associated with
                        peoples of the Pacific northwest; 4, IGA grocery store in Clair, New
                        Brunswick. Much of the signage is in French; while the province of New
                        Brunswick is officially bilingual, French is the primary language in the
                        upper St. John River valley; 5-6, A type of convenience store called a
                        depanner; these stores are distinct from others in that they open later in
                        the day and stay open later at night than others. They are numerous on the
                        New Brunswick side of the river; 7-8, Bi-lingual traffic sign along Highway
                        120 east of Clair; 9, Street sign in New Brunswick, the majority of which
                        (at least in the upper St. John River valley) are in French; 10, School bus
                        parked next to a home, presumably that of the driver, near Clair. New
                        Brunswick has separate school systems for English and French speakers; this
                        bus is used in the French system, which enrolls many more pupils than the
                        English; 11, The hills of Maine as seen from New Brunswick; the hedgerows
                        may mark property division lines of the earliest land grants, which were
                        measured in arpent and laid out in the French long lot fashion; 12-13, A
                        bilingual sign near Edmunston; 14, Sign on a plumber's place of business in
                        Edmunston; business signs in this part of New Brunswick are generally either
                        bilingual or French only, although a few English only signs can be found.
                        The following images were taken in St. David Village, in the town of
                        Madawaska, ME; 15-18, A woven mat, thought to be of Native American
                        manufacture, which was purportedly found hidden in the walls of the Fred
                        Albert house in St. David when it was moved to the property of the Madawaska
                        historical society. The mat is currently kept in a glass display case in the
                        Albert house; 19-20, The home of Geraldine and Ernie Chasse in St. David,
                        ME. This fairly large house is of mid-nineteenth century log construction,
                        and has been enlarged several times; the roof has been raised and the former
                        summer kitchen enclosed. Twentieth century re-modeling includes the addition
                        of a second floor over the former kitchen, the rearrangement of interior
                        walls, and the brick facade.

        These images document the house of Geraldine and Ernie Chasse in St. David
                        Village, town of Madawaska, ME; 1-3, Exterior of Chasse house; see MAP
                        DW-C012 for more information about the house; 4, Fieldworker Howard Marshall
                        takes a photo of Gerry and Ernie in front of their house; 5, View of St.
                        David Catholic Church from Chasse house; 6, The Chasses' garden; These
                        images document the Fort Kent Blockhouse; 7-8, Fort Kent Blockhouse, 1839
                        log blockhouse at the confluence of the Fish and St. John River, built by a
                        Maine civil posse as a result of the Maine-New Burnswick boundary dispute;
                        These images document the Maison Daigle-St-Jean in Clair, New Brunswick;
                        9-19, Exterior of the Maison Daigle-St-Jean, a restored midnineteenth
                        century house; 20, Interior of the Maison Daigle-St-Jean; this type of
                        ceiling was commonly used in Acadian houses. The blue woodwork above the
                        molding appears to have been carved to resemble a rope.

        These images document the Maison Daigle-St-Jean, a restored mid-nineteenth
                        century house in Clair, New Brunswick; 1-5, Interior of the house; the fine
                        carpentry and decorative woodwork attest to the skills of Acadian builders;
                        These images document the Fred Albert house, a mid-nineteenth Acadian house
                        which has been moved from its original location to a site on property owned
                        by the Madawaska Historical Society in St. David Village, ME; 6-7, Loom;
                        8-15, Furniture and artifacts in the house, including a typical Acadian
                        cupboard and chairs, a churn, and a cast-iron stove; 16-17, Fieldworker
                        Howard Marshall examines a ship's knee in the attic; 18-20, Ship's knee in
                        the attic. Ship's knees, a device used primarily in boat building, are a
                        single piece of wood carved from the part of the tree where the root
                        naturally curves upward into the trunk. Found in a variety of buildings in
                        the study area, they were apparently used in construction until near the end
                        of the nineteenth century (and possibly into the twentieth).

        These images document the Fred Albert house, a restored mid-nineteenth
                        century house in St. David, ME; 1, Top half of ship's knee in the attic,
                        showing the heads of the drift pins used to fasten the knee to the top plate
                        of the house. See MAP-DW-C014 for more slides and information; 2-3, Door
                        from the house currently stored in the attic; the chamfered panels are a
                        typical feature of Acadian woodworking; 4-5, Corner joinery and rafters in
                        the attic. Most of the joinery is done with mortises and tenons and secured
                        with wooden pegs. The large timbers forming the frame of the house are
                        hand-hewn; 6-10, Door frame on the main floor; fine woodworking is a
                        hallmark of Acadian construction; 11, Decorative painting on a wall; 12-14,
                        First floor ceiling; this type of ceiling construction was often used by
                        Acadian builders; These images are of scenes in Edmunston, New Brunswick;
                        15-16, Small market on the outskirts of the city; 17-18, Centre
                        universitaire St-Louis-Maillet, a branch campus of the University of
                        Moncton. The water in the foreground is the Madawaska River; 19-20, Carpet
                        store in Edmunston; the sign, like many in this part of Canada, is in
                        English and French.

        Except for #1-2, these images document the Fred Albert house, located on the
                        property of the Madawaska Historical Society in St. David, ME; 1-2,
                        Welcoming signs at the western edge of Madawaska on U.S. Highway 1; the
                        larger sign in the foreground is permanent, while the smaller sign for the
                        Acadian Festival is temporary; 3-7, Various views of the exterior of the
                        house; the size, shape, and proportion of this house (excluding the porch, a
                        later addition) are representative of a particular style of mid-nineteenth
                        century houses in the study area, many of which are still in use. Typically,
                        these houses have been enlarged and often moved from their original
                        location; this particular house has been moved more than once; 8-15, Details
                        of the porch and railings; it is probable that the porch was a later
                        addition, most likely added when the house was moved and enlarged. Field
                        coordinator Ray Brassieur suggests that the posts and railings are
                        stylistically quite nautical; 16-17, Rear door, with chamfered panels
                        typical of Acadian woodwork; 18, Wildflowers on the grounds outside the
                        house; 19-20, Artifacts in the house; the cupboard and chairs are typical
                        Acadian furniture.

                        owned by the Madawaska Historical Society in St. David, ME; 1-3, Fieldworker
                        Howard Marshall examines and photographs a cupboard in the Albert house;
                        this cupboard, with chamfered panels on the inside of the doors, is a

                        mid-nineteenth century Acadian house in Clair, New Brunswick, which has been

                        century house in Clair, New Brunswick; 1-6, Various interior scenes on the
                        main floor of the house; 7-11, Collection of artifacts in the attic; also

                        handle; 13-14, Stairs leading from the attic to a small loft; this loft was
                        probably added during a period when the house was being enlarged to
                        accommodate the family's growth; 15-16, Interior roof construction. It is
                        difficult to tell if these rafters are lapped or joined with mortise and
                        tenon; both methods were common in the houses built at this time; These
                        images document the talent show held as a part of the annual Acadian
                        Festival in Madawaska, ME; 17-19, Opening ceremony, including a prayer and
                        recitation of the statement "Je suis fier d'etre Acadien" (I am proud to be

                        representative of traditional Acadian garb. Note the four flags on the left—
                        America, Canada, New Brunswick, and Acadia— as well as the large Acadian
                        flag which serves as a backdrop; 20, Talent show MC Beurmond Banville.

        These images document a variety of buildings, mostly houses, and other
                        scenes in Madawaska, ME. Specific structures were chosen to photograph based
                        on color— in particular, the use of vivid greens and blues, and the use of a
                        slightly varying shade of red-brown which is often called oxblood (or sang
                        de boeuf in French); 1-6, Various houses; 7-8, Fire hydrant; the use of the
                        bright green echoes a color often used in painting buildings; 9-17, Various
                        houses; 18, A rural scene in Madawaska; the long, narrow field traversing
                        the hill reminds one of the French long lot style of land grants; 19, Some
                        sort of municipal building along a stream which is painted with the same
                        sort of green often seen on houses; 20, House in Madawaska; the butterflies
                        on the exterior wall are a commonly used decorative device in the study
                        area.

        These images document several different houses in Madawaska, ME; these
                        houses were chosen to photograph to typify certain decorative aspects common

                        oats. Most farmers plant some sort of grain, often oats, along with
                        potatoes; sometimes these are used as rotation crops; 3, Produce storage
                        barn called a potato house; often, these are partially buried as an
                        insulating technique; 4-5, Small garden on the farm; note that the plants
                        are still covered for protection against possible frost, although it is late
                        June; 6, Another view of the fields; 7, Notice on door to potato house,
                        warning against contamination of seed potatoes; 8, Field of young potato
                        plants, probably planted about three weeks ago; 9, Handmade wooden potato
                        barrels, seldom used in modern harvesting; 10, Barn and shed. Note the
                        custom painted sign with MPG (Maine Potato Growers) logo; these are found on
                        many farms in the study area; The following images are of a variety of
                        scenes in Madawaska, ME; 11-12, Sign at gas station on Main St. announcing
                        aspects of Acadian Festival; 13, Sirois Sharpening Service truck; 14-16,
                        Barn on a farm on Beaulieu Rd. ; the connected in-line barns are an unusual
                        type. It is unknown if the barns are currently in use; 17, Potato field
                        (foreground) and view of the St. John River Valley; 18-20, Former house now
                        used as storage on a farm; the smaller section is probably an addition to
                        the original house.

                        1-3, House with trim painted in widely-used red-brown color. #3, note the
                        pelican on the steps; pelicans are not native fauna, but pelican statues are
                        frequently used as decorative items; 4, Truck with bright blue/green paint,
                        echoing shades often used to paint houses; 5, Houses painted with bright
                        blue/green colors; 6, House using a gray and red-brown color combination;
                        this combination is often used in the study area; 7, Store in Lavertu

                        area, but the addition which wraps around nearly three-quarters of the barn
                        is not; 17-18, Houses using bright blue/green colors; 19, Old bus parked
                        behind a house; the gray and red color scheme echoes that use in many
                        houses; 20, Handmade wooden potato barrels.

                        bright blue/green, a common color choice; 2, Shrine in a yard; a great
                        number of houses in the study area have such shrines, primarily to the

                        one is on Eagle Lake; 13-20, Wooden strip canoe being built by Jerry White
                        and Mark Jallbert at White's home in Frenchville.

                        helps solve the problem; 17, House painted a bright blue/green; many houses
                        in the study area are painted with similar shades; 18-19, A type of

                        Tardiff sawmill on the Fish River; 2-3, Two similar houses on State Highway
                        11. The smaller sections are probably additions; such lateral additions are
                        one of the most common types in the study area; 4, House painted bright
                        blue, a common color choice; 5, House with lateral addition; 6, Replica of
                        Eiffel Tower, said to be built by the resident of the house; 7, Decorative
                        eagle on house; eagles are commonly used as a decoration; 8, See #6; 9,
                        Another house with a lateral addition; 10, Shed with a gambrel roof, a style
                        used on a variety of buildings in the study area; 11, A vegetable garden;
                        12, Farmland as seen from State Highway 11; the hedgerows running up the
                        hill may mark lines of original property division; 13, Shrine at the end of
                        a driveway; 14, Beauty salon in a house on State Highway 11; the
                        incorporation of business and residence is common; 15-16, Wheeled docks,
                        locally called quay for email; the wheels enable the docks to be pulled from
                        the water before the winter freeze, thus averting ice damage; 17, Two houses
                        which use colors commonly seen in the study area— bright blue/green and gray
                        and red; 18, Decorative butterflies on a house; these are seen throughout
                        the study area, but a concentration of them is on State Highway 11 between
                        Fort Kent and Eagle Lake; not surprisingly, there is a maker of the
                        butterflies on this road; 19, Another example of a residence/business
                        combination, this one an auto repair shop; 20, A house with a lateral
                        addition.

        These images document a variety of buildings and scenes; 1, Decorative eagle
                        on house; 2, Abandoned and collapsing barn; many farmers in the area have
                        quit farming, and abandoned agricultural buildings are found throughout the
                        study area; 3-4, Decorative butterflies; see #18; 5, Decorative eagle; 6,
                        The Saucier Store on State Highway 11. The combination of house and store
                        common; there are three such stores along the twelve mile stretch of Highway
                        11 between Eagle Lake and Fort Kent; 7, Mailbox set back from road to avoid
                        snow and snowplow damage; 8, Rectangular clothesline, a type common in the
                        area; 9-11, Collapsing farm buildings; 12-13, Eagle Lake as seen from a hill
                        on State Highway 11; much of the land now forested was at one time
                        agricultural; 14, House incorporating gambrel roofline as a decorative
                        element; 15, Wildflowers; 16, Farm buildings no longer in use; 17, Another
                        rectangular clothesline; most are made with wooden posts, but these are
                        metal; 18, Decorative butterflies, made from a wide variety of scrap wood
                        (including leftover paneling) and hand-painted are seen on houses throughout
                        the study area; a maker of the butterflies (name unknown) lives in this
                        house; 19, A beauty salon in a residence; a number of these can be found in
                        the study area; 20, Logging truck parked at a house on State Highway 11;
                        independent trucking is an occupation of importance in the study area.

        These images document a variety of buildings and scenes; 1-2, Wooden
                        "running potato" in a yard; this is a fairly common type of yard ornament;
                        3, Sign at Aroostook Creations, a craft shop on State Highway 11; 4,
                        Rectangular clothesline, a common type in the area; 5, House with a lateral
                        addition; this type of addition is one of the most common types in the study
                        area; 6, Forest and grassland; some of this was probably once farmland; 7,
                        An abandoned house along a stream west of State Highway 11. The materials
                        used indicate that this was built in the 20th century, but birch bark was
                        still used as insulation; 8, A wheeled dock (quay); the wheels enable the
                        dock to be pulled from the water before the winter freeze, thus averting ice
                        damage; 9, Looking east toward Brown's Point from the west side of Eagle
                        Lake; the gray and red house of Katherine Brown is visible, as is the red
                        house belonging to Phil Brown which served as home to fieldworkers Ray
                        Brassieur and David Whitman during the survey; 10, Quay; see #8; 11, An
                        island in Eagle Lake; 12, Quay; see #8; 13, See #9; 14, House of Fort Kent
                        artist George Roy; 15, Shrine at a house in Fort Kent; many houses in the
                        study area have such shrines; 6, 16 Windmill made by George Roy, who claims
                        it can generate electricity if properly hooked up; 17, Artist George Roy
                        with a chainsaw carving which he made; 18, Potato fields and a small herd of
                        cattle on a farm along U.S. Route 1 in Frenchville; 19-20, Downtown

                        a house on U.S. Highway 1; these shrines are common at houses in the study
                        area, but only a few are lit at night like this one; These images document
                        an event called Tintamarre, which was held during the annual Grande Riviere
                        Festival in Van Buren. A Tintamarre is apparently some type of celebratory
                        noisemaking; at this event, Americans contested against Canadians to see
                        which side could make the most noise; 5-20, People gather in parking lots
                        prior to a procession to the international bridge between Van Buren, ME, and
                        StLeonard, New Brunswick, the site of the contest. The assorted pots, pans,
                        washboards, etc., are used for noisemaking.

        These images document the Tintamarre and the tug-of war at the annual Grande

                        Ste-Ouenne, France; a group from that town visits each year to take part in
                        the Grande Riviere Festival. Early settlers of the Van Buren— Ste-Leonard
                        area, at one time called Grande Riviere, were from Ste-Ouenne; 9, Looking up
                        the St. John River from the international bridge; a canoe can be seen on the
                        river, but in general boating on the St. John was uncommon; 10, Various
                        dignitaries address the crowd; 11, Canoe on the St. John; 12-13, See #10;

                        International tug-of-war, Van Buren v. St-Leonard, on the bridge;
                        incredibly, traffic was allowed to pass despite the crowd of participants
                        and spectators, and it seemed a dangerous situation.

                        study area; 11, Custom sign with MPG (Maine Potato Growers) logo; such sings

        These images document a variety of buildings and scenes in Van Buren, ME; 1,
                        Perfect Ponies, a business on U.S. Highway 1 in the village of Keegan; many
                        residences in the study area incorporate some type of commercial activity;
                        2, Judy's Beauty Salon on U.S. 1, Keegan; such salons are one of the most
                        commonly found types of residence/business combinations; 3, Wrought iron
                        wayside cross, U.S. 1, Keegan; 4, A variety of lawn decoration, including a
                        shrine to the Virgin Mary; such shrines are widespread in the area; 5-6,
                        Al's Neighborhood Store, U.S. 1, Van Buren; the combination of residence
                        with convenience/grocery store is found throughout the study area; 7, House
                        painted a vivid blue/green, a popular color choice; 8, Shed under
                        construction in Van Buren. The gambrel roof is a style used on many
                        different types of buildings in the study area; many small sheds with this
                        roof type appear to be made from kits, but this example is being built from
                        scratch by the carpenter who lives on the property; 9-10, Small wooden
                        handmade boat in Van Buren; this boat was said to have been built by a
                        one-armed carpenter from St. Agatha, ME, who built approximately eight such
                        boats; 11-13, Seagulls on a dock on Long Lake near the Van Buren public
                        beach area; 14-15, Wildflowers in a field in Van Buren; 16-20, Sunset from a

        These images document a variety of buildings and scenes; 1-2, Sunset from a
                        hilltop in Van Buren; 3-6, Spraying potato fields; local growers describe
                        potato farming as input intensive; 7, Partially buried potato house in
                        Hamlin. This structure combines a construction method long used in building
                        such barns, earth contact, with a relatively modern material, corrugated
                        steel; 8, Trucks on a farm in Hamlin; many area farmers are also shippers of
                        both their own produce and goods produced by others; 9, St. Joseph Catholic
                        Church in Hamlin; 10-11, Barn with old farming machinery; the growth in
                        front of the doorways suggests that this machinery has been idle for some
                        time; 12, House and garage painted bright green; similar colors are widely
                        and often used, especially on houses. The facade on the garage is normally
                        associated with commercial buildings. See MAP-DW-C050, #8; 13, Medical
                        facility in Van Buren called L'Acadie; 14, Banner over U.S. Highway 1
                        announcing annual Grande Riviere Festival; 15, "Parking to see Indians" sign
                        at Village Acadien in Van Buren; Native American Day was held at the Village
                        on the previous day; 16, Large storage facilities called potato houses, in
                        which the produce would be stored just prior to shipment. Many, like these,
                        are no longer in use; 17-18, Wayside cross near the Village Acadien on U.S.
                        Highway 1 in Keegan; 19, Loading bundles of shakes at a small sawmill in
                        Keegan. Milling, formerly an industry of importance in the area, has
                        declined greatly; few sawmills are still operating; 20, Custom sign on a
                        potato farm; most farms in the study area have such signs. The sign
                        indicates that this enterprise combines growing and shipping; many, though
                        not all, farmers ship their own produce, and some ship other commodities as
                        well.

        These images document a variety of buildings and scenes; 1, Large L-shaped
                        house, a type found throughout the study area. There are usually at least
                        one or two examples of this type or a similar type in each town; one is
                        often the presbytery at the Catholic church; 2, Cattle in a field in Van
                        Buren; small herds of livestock are occasionally seen in the study area; 3,
                        House with a lateral addition; this type of addition is a widely used method
                        of enlarging houses; 4, Catholic church in Ste-Anne-du-Madawaska, New
                        Brunswick, photographed from U.S. 1 in Maine; 5, Barn with double gambrel
                        roof in Grand Isle; 6, House with lateral addition; see #3; 7, L-shaped
                        house; see #1; 8, The Gun Hospital, Grand Isle, an example of the
                        incorporation of business into residence; a wide variety of such businesses
                        are found in the study area; 9, House with lateral addition; see #3; 10-11,
                        St. Gerard Catholic Church in Grand Isle; 12, House with lateral addition;
                        see #3; 13, Shrine in a yard in Grand Isle; these shrines are a common sight
                        throughout the study area; 14, Recently constructed shed with an unusual
                        variation on the frequently seen gambrel roof; 15, L-shaped house; see #1;
                        16, House with lateral addition; see #3; 17, Variation on the L-shaped
                        house, this one with a gabledminstead of hipped roof; 18-20, L-shaped
                        houses; see #3. The facade on the garage in #19-20 is also interesting, as
                        such facades are often associated with commercial buildings.

        These images document a variety of buildings and scenes; 1, Two small
                        buildings with facades on a residential property in St. David, ME; such
                        facades are usually associated with commercial activity; 2-3, St. David
                        Catholic Church; 4, Large elm tree used by former railroad engineer Bob
                        Labonte to mark the approach to Madawaska; 5, Centre universiatire
                        St-Louis-Maillet in Edmunston, New Brunswick, photographed from U.S. Highway
                        1 in Madawaska, ME; 6, Bob's Neighborhood Store in Madawaska; the type of
                        lawn ornaments sold here, particularly those with a religious theme, are
                        widely popular in the study area; 7, Shrine in a yard in Madawaska; 8-9, St.
                        Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in Madawaska; 10, Street sign in Madawaska;

                        farm; the use of the term "grower-shipper" and the presence of the
                        semi-trailer exemplify the combination of functions performed by many
                        farmers in the study area; 16, Abandoned starch factory in Frenchville; 17,
                        See #15; 18, A variety of trucks belonging to C.L. Roy and Sons of

        These images document a variety of buildings and scenes; 1, Custom sign on a
                        potato farm in Frenchville; 2, Tractor-trailer on the C &amp; P Morin farm
                        in Frenchville; the presence of this truck and the use of the term
                        "grower-shipper" (sign, #1) are evidence of the combined activity performed
                        by many farmers in the study area; 3, Classic Casuals, a clothing store in a
                        home on U.S. Highway 1 in Frenchville; the combination of residence and
                        business is common, although a clothing store is unusual in this context;
                        4-5, St. Luce Catholic Church in Frenchville; 6-10, Various views of
                        downtown Fort Kent; 11, Rock's Motel, Main St., Fort Kent; 12-14, Sign
                        proclaiming Fort Kent as northern terminus of U.S. Route 1; the Maine end of
                        the international bridge between Fort Kent and Clair, New Brunswick is
                        visible in; 12-13, and the white building behind the sign in #14 is a
                        duty-free store; 15-16, A beauty salon in a home in Fort Kent; one of the
                        most common types of residential/commercial combinations, the number of
                        beauty salons in the area seems out of proportion to the population; 17-18,
                        Gene's Electronics, a new business in downtown Fort Kent; bright blue is a
                        popular color on a variety of buildings in the study area; 19-20, A train
                        car being loaded with logs in Fort Kent; while large-scale logging has
                        diminished in importance, a number of small logging operations still
                        exist.

        These images document a variety of buildings and scenes; 1, Pelican lawn
                        ornament, St, John; 2, St. John Catholic Church; there is no resident priest
                        here, but weekly services are held by a priest who also services other
                        parishes; 3-4, Presbytery across the road from St. John Church; note the
                        real estate agent's sign. The building is unoccupied; 5-6, Northern Maine
                        Tree Farm in a typical partially buried potato house; many of these have
                        been abandoned but only a few have been adapted to new uses like this one;
                        7, Catholic church in Wallagrass; 8, Beaver pond west of State Highway 11 in
                        Wallagrass; These images are aerial photographs of various parts of the
                        study area. The flight began at the airport in Frenchville, ME, headed east
                        to Van Buren, proceeded north and west along the St. John River to Fort
                        Kent, then south to Soldier Pond, and finally east over St. Agatha and back
                        to the Frenchville airport; 9-10, Farmland and forest near Long Lake; much
                        of what is now forest was once farm; 11-12, A small settlement in the town
                        of Madawaska known as Lavertu Settlement; 13-20, Looking north toward and
                        across the St. John River as the flight heads east to Van Buren; the pattern
                        of roads and fields shows evidence of the original long lot pattern of land
                        grants.

                        Frenchville airport; 1-4, Farmland and forest on both the Maine (near) and
                        New Brunswick sides of the St. John River; 5-6, Van Buren, ME, on the near
                        side of the St. John River, and St-Leonard, New Brunswick; 7, Van Buren

                        Van Buren; 10-15, The Val Violette house in Van Buren; originally built by
                        Belonie Violette, this was one of the original houses of Violette
                        Settlement. The house is a two-story house with a light gray gabled roof,
                        set back from the main street (U.S. Highway 1), near the center of each
                        frame; 16-20, Upriver from Van Buren; note the railroad tracks paralleling
                        the river, and the large commercial buildings along the tracks. The railroad
                        has been replaced by the highway as the prime mover of goods, and many of
                        these buildings have fallen into disuse.

                        roads and fields is suggestive of long lot land division, and much of this
                        forest was probably once in farms; 3-8, Soldier Pond, ME; the large

        An assortment of miscellaneous scenes on Eagle Lake; 1-4, Sunset on Eagle
                        Lake, photographed from the deck of the camp occupied by fieldworkers Ray

                        images document the Eloi Daigle house on U.S. Highway 1, Fort Kent, ME. This
                        house has apparently been continuously occupied since its construction in
                        the mid-nineteenth century; it is one of the oldest still standing in the
                        area; 16-20, Eloi Daigle house; the unpainted section and garage represent
                        much later additions.

                        document a ship's knee in the Fred Albert house in St. David, ME. Other
                        photo logs and field notes from this project contain a good deal of

        These images document a variety of buildings and scenes; 1, Sign warning of

                        in Fort Kent with a type of facade which is also found on residential

                        the fresh coat of bright blue paint may indicate that bright greens and

                        Brunswick. This house (Maison Daigle St. Jean) is an important historic
                        Acadian house that has been reconstructed as a museum site by the Clair
                        Historical Society, Inc. See Marshall's fieldnotes for June 26; 1-7, Eagle

                        This is a piece-sur-piece en colombage Acadian log house of the first
                        quality. SEE fieldnotes. Note its massing, its ornament, and the front door
                        area; 17, Brassier on the front porch; 18-20, Views of interior: kitchen.
                        Note built-in cupboard and the niche for various religious statues

                        a pair of Acadian type barns placed one behind the other with the interstice
                        framed in with a transverse roof; note that the exterior walls are shingled;
                        interior views suggest the framing (documented in Marshall fieldnotes).

                        stored until shipped via rail to the market; the potato house (a kind of
                        twolevel barn) has thickly insulated walls and is very dark; it is partly
                        built into the side of the hill to provide access for loading the potato
                        house from the top down.

                        Eagle Lake, ME; 26-27, Brassieur and Ornstein examine the demolished barn
                        belonging to Ethel Gagnon in Eagle Lake, ME. Old barns are often torn down
                        and the wood salvaged; often the large frame timbers are used to construct a
                        new barn. In frame #27, Mrs. Gagnon's house and tool shed are visible in the
                        background; 28-29, Ethel Gagnon; 30-31, An outbuilding behind the house
                        which Mrs. Gagnon called the "tool shed;" outbuildings are typical in the
                        study area, and this appears to be one of the oldest in Eagle Lake. Design
                        features of the outbuildings often echo those used in house construction;
                        note the Greek Revival cornices on this shed; 32-33, Remains of the sill of
                        the barn, typically constructed with large hewn timbers; 34, Brassieur
                        measures one of the barn timbers; 35, Ornstein examines the remains of the
                        barn; 36, Ground-level view of a large hewn timber used to construct the
                        sill of the barn; this type of construction was apparently common in the
                        19th century, and lasted into the early 20th century; 36a, Remains of the
                        barn.

        1-2, Bernette Albert gives her talk on the history of the first Acadians to
                        populate the St. John Valley at the memorial marking the spot where the
                        Acadians first landed; 4-8, Looking south from the memorial; note the
                        hedgerows traversing the hillsides, which may mark property line divisions
                        of the early land grants. These grants were done in the typically French
                        "long lots" and measured in arpents; 9, Front view of the Albert house,
                        which has been moved from its original location to the property owned by the
                        Madawaska Historical Society in St. David Village. The house is a typical
                        type built in the study area in the mid-18th century; the balustrade was
                        likely a later addtition; 10, Side view of the Albert house; 11, Fieldworker
                        Ray Brassieur and Madawaska Chamber of Commerce director Cathie Corey inside
                        the Albert house; 12, Fieldworker Lisa Ornstein examines a loom; 13,
                        Artifacts in the Albert house; 14-16, One of the looms; 17-18, A hinge on
                        the door of an armoire; the hand-made nails indicate this piece was probably
                        made in the early 18th century; 19-20, A woven mat which was purportedly
                        found in the walls of the Albert house; it appears to be of Native American
                        origin; 21-25, A part of the mat and a birch bark container which was also
                        found in the walls of the house; 26-27, A "ship's knee" in the attic of the
                        Albert house; these pieces were cut from the root and trunk of a hardwood
                        tree, maintaining the natural curve of the wood.Originally a maritime
                        construction method, these pieces were apparently used fairly often as roof
                        supports in 18th century houses in the study area; 28-29, A section of the
                        Albert house roof; note the ship's knee, the compound rafters, and the large
                        timbers which form the top plate, all typical of houses in the study area;
                        30, Ship's knee; these were attached to the framing timbers with drift pins;
                        31, Another view of a roof section showing rafters and a ship's knee; 32,
                        Brassieur and Claude "Blackie" Cyr of Madawaska examine the roof
                        construction in the Albert house; 33, Roof construction in the Albert house;
                        the absence of a ridgepole seems to have been universal in the constuction
                        of buildings in the study area; 34, Another view of the rafters and the peak
                        of the roof; 35-36, Joinery of rafters at the peak of the roof; as in many
                        houses in the study area, the rafters are joined with a mortise and tenon
                        and secured by a wooden peg.

                        Depreys discuss potato farming; 23-25, Wooden potato barrels. Such barrels,
                        which hold 165 pounds of potatoes, were once the standard storage container
                        when the harvest was done by hand; 26-27, Barn at Deprey Farm; many growers

                        "pit-sawn madrier," indicating that it is wood construction which may or may
                        not be log; 32-36a, Scenes inside Freeman's barn; note the picture of Saint
                        Therese and the rameaux ("blessed palm") hanging on the post. Such religious
                        objects can be found in every type of structure in the study area; their
                        function is to protect the building and occupants from disasters such as
                        lightning and fire.

        These images document a visit to the Village Acadien, a collection of
                        buildings which has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places.
                        All of the historic buildings have been moved to the site from elsewhere in
                        the study area; 2-4, Roy house, piece-sur-piece log construction; apparently
                        the corner joints of this house were partially sawn through so that it could
                        be moved, and it was then reconstructed. Detail of the joinery is probably
                        not historically accurate; 7-9, Maison Morneault, a typical Acadian house of
                        midnineteenth century construction; the current house probably represents an
                        enlargement of the original structure. The small addition on the far side
                        once served as a post office; 10-19, Other buildings at the Village,
                        including a house (11-12), a barn (13-14), a reconstruction of a log church
                        (15-16), and a schoolhouse (17); 20-21, Field coordinator Ray Brassieur
                        talks with birdhouse maker Albert Michaud, who sells his birdhouses from
                        this truck parked in the lot at the Village Acadien; These images document a
                        house and barn on the property of Gilbert Perrault in Wallagrass, ME; 22-23,
                        Exterior of barn; Perrault (left) points out features of the barn to
                        Brassieur; 24-28, Exterior of the house; the long and narrow proportions of
                        this house are unusual for the study area. The large door at the rear
                        provided carriage access; 29-30, Interior of the barn; 31-33, Sliding double
                        doors on the barn; there is a set of double doors on each side; 34-35,
                        Sliding mechanism on barn doors; small grooved iron wheels slid along an
                        iron guide rail. 3 6-36a Exterior of the barn. Note that part of the lower
                        half is sided with shakes, which provided superior insulation for the
                        livestock kept in this section of the barn.

                        made them obsolete. They are used in smaller quantities for storage in many
                        farms.

                        began in the Depression of the 1930s. This photograph was taken at
                        Rosette's, a restaurant in Frenchville, ME, where an informal count showed
                        nearly half the cars to have out-of-state license plates; 34-36, Tractor in

        These images document a reunion of the Lavertu family held on Edgar
                        Lavertu's farm in Lavertu Settlement, ME. The reunion drew family members
                        from as far away as Florida, as well as many people from closer states like
                        Massachusetts and Connecticut. A whole pig was barbecued for the reunion
                        meal, and there were displays of memorabilia and souvenirs and a family
                        history book compiled by Roger Lavertu offered for sale. A monument to the
                        first Lavertu settlers of the area was unveiled and Roger Lavertu gave a
                        brief oral family history; 1-11, Cars with a variety of out-of-state license
                        plates; 12, Sign on one of Lavertu's barns; 13-21, More out-of-state cars;
                        22, Large quonset hut barn served as the location for the barbecue, souvenir
                        and memorabilia displays, and entertainment; 23-24, One of the family
                        members served as emcee (name unknown); 25-26, Wooden potato barrels in the

                        popular activity; 35-36, The crew in charge of the pig roast. The pig was
                        purchased through Jess' Market in Frenchville; preparing pigs for roasts is
                        one of Jess' specialties. Gerald Ouellette (white hat, mustache) of St.
                        David, ME, was said to be the expert pig roaster.

        These images document a variety of buildings and scenes; 1, Rectangular
                        clothesline; this is a common type in the area; 2-3, House of decorative
                        butterfly maker, State Highway 11, Wallagrass, ME. These decorative
                        butterflies were displayed on the exterior of many houses in the study area;
                        most appear to be made from scrap wood and handpainted a variety of colors;
                        4-5, Magic Shears Salon in Wallagrass; many residents have opened businesses
                        in their houses, and beauty salons are one of the most often seen types; 6,
                        Logging truck at a house in Wallagrass; independent trucking seems to be an
                        important economic activity in the area; 7, Wooden "running potato" lawn
                        decoration; potatoes are the primary crop in the study area, and these lawn
                        decorations are fairly common; 8-9, Rectangular clothesline; 10-11, Forest
                        and farmland, Wallagrass; a great deal of land in the area has gone out of
                        agricultural production and is returning to forest; 13-15, Abandoned and
                        decaying house in an area called the "back settlements." This house is of
                        twentieth century construction judging by the materials, but it had birch
                        bark insulation; 16-20, Wheeled dock called a quay on the western side of
                        Eagle Lake. The wheels enable the dock to be removed from the water before
                        the winter freeze, thus averting ice damage. Such docks are found on every
                        lake in the study area; this one is longer than most, and has four wheels
                        instead of the usual two. It seems to be in need of repair; 21-23, Another
                        quay near Eagle Lake; the fenders are a most unusual feature; 24-25, Home
                        and studio of Fort Kent sculptor and painter George Roy; the small statue of
                        a logger near the door was made by Roy using a chainsaw; 26-27, The Forever
                        Young Club, Madawaska, ME; a group of senior citizens holds a Saturday night
                        dance here.

        These images document a variety of scenes; 2, Set-back mailbox with
                        reflector, strategies to mark the box's location when the deep winter snows
                        pile up, and try to avoid snowplow damage; 3-4, Mobile home with added
                        gambrel roof. This roof style is popular on a variety of buildings in the
                        study area, sometimes for functional but often for purely decorative
                        reasons; 5-7, Decorative eagles on a house in Fort Kent; these are found
                        throughout the study area; 8-14, Wheeled dock, locally called a quay. on
                        Eagle Lake, ME; the wheels enable the dock to be removed from the water
                        before the winter freeze, thus averting ice damage. The small motor boat is
                        a type of craft often used on area lakes; These images document a visit to
                        the home of Jerry and Jean White in Frenchville, ME, to see a wooden strip
                        canoe being built by Jerry and Mark Jalbert of St. Agatha, ME. Canoes are
                        common in the study area, but most are mass-produced fiberglass or ABS
                        types; 15-30, Various views of the canoe under construction; 31-end, Jalbert
                        (cap) and White work on the canoe.

                        function was to store the produce prior to shipping by rail. Most, although
                        not all, of them are no longer used for their original purpose. Some stand
                        empty; this one, on Market St. in Fort Kent, has been converted to
                        commercial/retail space; 23-24, Monique's Hair Salon, Fort Kent; area
                        residents often operate small business endeavors from their homes; salons
                        are quite common in this arrangement; 25-27, Shrine in a yard in Fort Kent;
                        such shrines are a common sight in the study area; 28-30, Eagles used as

                        snowplows; 33-36, Rectangular clothesline, a common type in the area; 37,

                        throughout the study area; the wheels enable them to be pulled from the
                        water before the winter freeze, thus averting ice damage; 6-7, Another quay,
                        in Eagle Lake; 8-9, Butterflies, most of which seem to be hand-made and

                        barn with collapsing roof; as agriculture declines in importance, more farm
                        buildings are being abandoned. Some simply stand and decay, but a great many

        These images document a Saturday night dance at the Forever Young Club in
                        Madawaska, ME. This dance is apparently part of a circuit of such dances
                        held at various locations in the upper St. John river valley, in both the
                        Maine and New Brunswick. The music for this dance was provided by a
                        father/son team, ??????? (fiddle and guitar); there was also synthesized
                        percussion. The most popular dance was a mixer called "Lady of the Lake,"
                        which was danced several times during the evening to a variety of
                        reel/hornpipe tunes. Some of the dances, including the "Lady of the Lake,"
                        were called; there were also couples dances that were not called. There were
                        tables set up on both sides of the dance floor, and people would sit at
                        these tables and socialize between dances; 2-14, A series of photographs
                        taken during one of the early dances; 15-16, Field coordinator Ray Brassieur

        These images document a variety of buildings and scenes; 2-6, The
                        Farrell-Michaud House, an early twentieth century house in Van Buren, ME,
                        which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house is
                        currently operated as a bed-and-breakfast; 8-9, Custom painted sign on a
                        farm in New Canada; most farms in the study area have such signs; 10-14,
                        Buildings with facades, New Canada, ME. This type of facade is often
                        associated with commercial buildings, but many garages and other buildings
                        on residential property have these facades; 15-16, A typical partially
                        buried potato house in New Canada; the earth provides insulation for the
                        produce; 17, Fieldworker David Whitman's truck is up to the axles in weeds;
                        18-19, Abandoned agricultural equipment, not an uncommon sight; 20, Mailbox
                        set back (way back) from the road; this helps prevent damage from snow and
                        snowplow; 21, Abandoned and collapsing potato house; 22-23, A man tins the
                        roof on a farm building in New Canada. Tin was once a common roofing
                        material but is used less today; 24, Scooter Helper, a repair business on
                        State Highway 161 in Fort Kent, ME; many area residents operate small
                        businesses from their homes; 25-26, Another garage with facade; 27-28,
                        Rectangular clothesline, a common type in the area; 29, Shed with gambrel
                        roof, locally called colm-casse; this roof style is used on a wide variety
                        of buildings throughout the study area; 30-31, Trucks parked on a farm in
                        Fort Kent; trucking is an important economic activity in the region, and
                        many farmers are also shippers; 32-33, An independent trucker in Fort Kent;
                        34, A collection of farm buildings in Fort Kent; 35-36, Sign on a barn on
                        the Daigle Bros, farm in Fort Kent; note the inclusion of shipping and
                        trucking; 36a, Another garage with a facade in Fort Kent.

        1-2, Sign on a barn south of Van Bur en on U.S. Highway 1; quite a few of
                        the farmers in the study area combine trucking/shipping with farming; These
                        images document an event called Native American Day, held at the Village
                        Acadien in Van Buren, ME, as part of the annual Grande Riviere Festival;
                        3-4, A group of participants, most of whom are Mic-Mac from various reserves
                        in New Brunswick, rehearse a song before the event. Event coordinator Guy
                        Frigon (black hat) of Frenchville, ME, is one of the singer/drummers; 5-7,
                        Participants rehearse in front of a tipi set up especially for this event;
                        10-11, This object hung over the door of the tipi; I collected no
                        information about it; 12-14, Headdress hanging on a fence post; Frigon said
                        that this is not a true Mic-Mac style, but more of a western or plains
                        Indian style. They use this headdress for events like this because it
                        represents what "white folks" expect to see; 15-16, Two of the participants
                        talk with a spectator; 17-22, Guy Frigon and Kenny Cloud of the Red Bank
                        Reserve in New Brunswick perform a ceremony in which the drum is blessed
                        with tobacco; 23, A sweetgrass braid is lit; the smoldering braid will be
                        used to purify both participants and spectators; 24-26, Participants are
                        purified with smoke from the braid, fanned with feathers; 27, Birdhouse
                        maker Albert Michaud watches the ceremony; 28-29, Participants sing and drum
                        while Cloud circulates through the crowd with the sweetgrass braid; 30-32,
                        Cloud purifies spectators; 33-34, Small wooden canoe carved by Kenny Cloud;

        These images document Tardiff sawmill in Fort Kent, ME; see MAP-DWB050 for
                        more information; 2-3, Exterior view of the mill; 4-7, Logs and sawdust pile
                        up outside the mill; 8, Saw sharpening device fabricated by Raoul Tardiff;
                        these can be purchased commercially, but are expensive; 9, Spare parts,
                        storage, and repair room in the mill; 10-12, Office; the object on the top
                        of the desk is a windpowered model of loggers made by Raoul Tardiff. It is
                        usually kept on a shelf in the office; 13, Planer, bought second-hand and
                        refurbished by Raoul; 14-15, Danny Tardiff saws boards; 16-18, Spare parts,
                        storage, and repair room; 19-20, Succession of mill ownership written in
                        concrete at the door to the mill office. "Corriveau 1948" refers to the
                        mill's builder, Joseph Corriveau. Raoul Tardiff bought the mill in 1961;
                        These images document a collection of musical instruments which belonged to
                        the late Theodore Brown of Wallagrass, ME. They are currently in the
                        possession of his widow, Katherine; 21-22, An instrument called a
                        "mandolin-guitar harp" by its manufacturer, The Home Educational Co. of
                        Concord, North Carolina; the instrument has 4 6 strings; 23-24, Open-backed
                        5-string banjo made by S. S. Stewart, Philadelphia, PA. This banjo, as well
                        as the two described below, are probably of late 1920s or early 1930s
                        manufacture; 25-26, Long-necked Vega tenor banjo; 26-27, Another Vega tenor
                        banjo, this one with the more usual shorter neck. Both Vega banjos had maple
                        resonators and chrome tone rings; 29-30, Harmony tenor guitar, mahogany body
                        and spruce top; vintage unknown. Tenor guitars enjoyed a brief surge in
                        popularity during the "folk revival" of the 1960s, and this instrument may
                        date from that period; These images document a series of maps photographed
                        at the Registry of Deeds in Fort Kent, ME. Local historian Guy Dubay
                        assisted me by finding relevant maps; 31-33, Madawaska; from an 1843 map by
                        Philip Eastman, John W. Dana, and Henry M. Cunningham. Three tiers, or rang,
                        of long lots can be seen extending back from the St. John River. This map
                        contains the original site of the Fred Albert house, lot #138; 34-36, Van
                        Buren; a composite map done in 1933 by Henry J. Pelletier using 1846 and
                        1860 maps. Notice how the long lots of the original grants given to the
                        French meet the square plots granted later by the United States government.
                        This area of later grants is often referred to as the concession; 37, Van
                        Buren, from the Atlas of Aroostook County, Maine, by F. B. Roe and N. Geo.
                        Colby, 1877. This map contains the sites of the house presently owned by Val
                        Violette, and the Maison Heritage, a National Register of Historic Places
                        house which is currently disassembled and under a tarp behind the house of
                        Don Cyr in Lille, ME.

                        area; 4-5, Corriveau buckwheat mill, Frenchville. This mill no longer
                        operates; in fact, there is no currently operating buckwheat mill in the

                        Corriveau mill; 15-20, Loons on Eagle Lake, photographed from the deck of

                        from Massachusetts. He chose this name for his business for its identity
                        value; 29-30, Temporary bridge over the St. John River in Allagash, ME; the
                        former bridge was destroyed in the spring, 1990 flood; 31-32, Farmstead in
                        St. Francis, ME; the barn is an interesting one, and the house has an

                        storage, St. Francis; there were apparently a number of schoolhouses of this

                        buildings collapsing or being torn down, but this is one of the few we saw

                        shipping. Many of these in the study area are still standing but not
                        currently in use; 19, Pickup truck with wooden potato barrels in the bed;
                        these barrels were at one time widely used in the handharvesting of
                        potatoes, but mechanical harvesting has rendered them obsolete. Some have
                        been adapted to other purposes; 20, Gift shop at the Village Acadien These
                        images document a visit to the Long Lake home of Claude "Blackie" Cyr in St.
