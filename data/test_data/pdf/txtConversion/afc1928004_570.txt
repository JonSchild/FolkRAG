I'm Major Skipp, of the 75th, 
A 
gay and dashing fellah; 
My togs are neat, my style's complete, 
I'm a 
Regular Army swell, ah. 
When at the ball, the ladies all, 
To waltz with me are crazy; 
At me they smile, they like my style, 
And say that I'm a 
daisy. 
Cuouns: 
I 
dance, I 
prance, 
The music's time obeying. 
I 
reel, I 
feel, 
So jolly when its playing. 
My whiskers are the pink of style, 
I 
look like Lord Dundreary, 
The pretty gills with giddy curls, 
Say the major is a 
deary. 
Up to my throat, my blue frock coat 
Is buttoned very tightly. 
My legs are thin, my waist is slim,. 
But still I'm gay and sprightly. 
I 
am not tall, my cap is small, 
A 
short cane I 
do carry. 
A_ countess yet I'll mash, you bet,. 
And then, by Jove, I'll marry..

THE ELDERLY COUPLE. 
A.s sung by the DAYTON'S with great success 
We're an elderly couple, quite gay and contented, 
Two old century plants, my old wife and me; 
For troubles gone by, we're never tormented, 
At all times you'll find us quite happy and free. 
Though our hair has turned gray, we try to be jolly, 
For money or riches, we never do cry; 
We throw cares to the wind, for sorrow is folly, 
So while we both live, we will never say die. 
CHORUS. 
So never say die, don't give way to sorrow, 
If trouble should come, look it square in the eyes; 
And when you grow old, you still will be jolly, 
So cheer up my boys, and never say die. 
The night may be dark, and the world may look dreary, 
But to-worrow the sun will shine bright and clear; 
On the roadside of life, don't ever get weary, 
For when night is the darkest, the sunshine is near. 
In the journey of life, let us help one another, 
And you'll meet vvith good luck, like my old wife and I; 
Be honest and true, and help each as a 
brother, 
And when you get old, don't ever say die.

I 
know a 
little soldier, and on drill or dress parade 
lie walks so firm and stately to the. music that is played; 
lie looks so neat and dashing, he marches straight and 
stiff, 
I 
love this little soldier, his name is Major Skiff. 
I 
admire this major, he's the prince of army swells; 
Flirts with all the ladies, he's admired by all the belles. 
'Tis true he's rather foppish, and he marches rather stiff, 
But if ever I 
should marry I 
will marry Major Skiff. 
In 
his coat my little major wears a 
button- hole bouquet, 
:‘..nd glances at the ladies as he marches on so gay; 
'Tis true he's not a 
giant, but surely I 
don't care a 
whiff, 
I 
love this military swell, my gallant Major Skiff. 
When the ladies are on hand the major marches grand, 
la his uniform so handsome his men he does command. 
;Moulder arms, men march forward, and the music then 
does play, 
And the battalion marches briskly on a 
bright and sunny 
day.

rm troubled and vexed, the reason why— 
I'll now explain to you. 
I'm so forgetful all the time— 
I 
know not what to do, 
When— but a 
little boy of ten— 
If mother sent me out, 
To buy the stuff for baby's pap, 
I 
brought home sourtraut! 
SPOKEN.—It'S an actual fact, ever since I 
came into this 
great and glorious world, I 
have been absent minded. I 
am not sure that I 
was evcr born. 
Perhaps I 
was hatched 
by sham! I 
will swear I 
do not know who my father was 
—eh I—why—swipes T 
Cuortus: 
I'm an absent minded man, 
Have been so since my birth, 
And have done naught but silly things, 
Since I've been on this earth. 
The many foolish things I 
do, 
Are hard to understand; 
I've often hunted for my glove, 
When it was on my band. 
While riding in a 
Broadway stage, 
I 
met with a 
sad mishap; 
I 
pulled my left hand neighbor's nose, 
Instead of the driver's strap.

SPoKEN-.—Yes, I 
was out riding yesterday in a stage; a 
lady asked me to put her fare in the box, I 
took it and 
placed it in my owl, pocket. 
I 
couldn't help it—I'm so 
ab8ent landed. 
Last evening as I 
was returning from the 
Laundry, smoking a 
tior de rank a 
peedie segar, I 
felt 
weary, and concluded to mtire for the night. 
Well, I 
took 
off my clothes, placed my segar in bed, chucked my

Air.—Empty Cradle. 
Little empty pig pen smells so nice and sweet, 
how the precious burden used to squeal; 
-We can have some roast pork and pickled pig's feet, 
And some fresh spare ribs every meal. 
We killed him with a 
knife at the right time of the moor, 
And scrubbed him till the break of dawn; 
Now he's in the barrel, salted for evermore, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy'-4 
gone. 
CHORUS: 
Piggy's 1..4t the swill-trough to eat from it no more, 
O'er the briny water he has flown; 
Gone to join the Boers on Africa's shore, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone. 
Near the cellar door stands a 
barrel now, 
Overhead the cob-webs are thick; 
It always makes us sad when we think of him now, 
And the many times we scratched him with a 
stick. 
He could play seven up, and draw poker too. 
And sing all the latest songs; 
Now he's in a 
barrel packed forever more, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone. (Chorus)..

DANCE ME ON YOUE, 
Sung with great success by Miss Minnie Leg 
When I 
was very young how fond 14as of childish joys; 
I 
loved to play among the girls, but better with the boys: 
It was pussy in the corner, tag and ineminie, 
And when my ma put me in bed I 
would steel out on the 
sly. 
I 
dared not make the slightest noise when getting back in 
bed, 
The biggest boy would boost me in my window overhead; 
I 
would go to sleep and dream I 
was a 
lady young and 
gay, 
And when my ma would take me up to her I 
used to sar. 
CHORUS— 
Dance me on your knee, mother, dance me on your knee; 
Clasp your arms around my waist, it wont hurt me. 
Hold me tight, don't let me fall, I 
won't be afraid at all, 
Dance me, mother, dance me on your knee. 
16 
DANCE ME 
ON YOUR KNEE.—Concluded. 
But when I 
wore long dresses first the little boys I 
shook, 
As my ideas developed the bigger ones I 
took. 
Instead of childish games it was parties, social balls and 
drives, 
Where'er I 
went I 
had my favorite escort by my side. 
But when. I 
tire of one young man, another soon I 
take, 
For there's a 
way of knowing bow to give the boys a 
quiet 
shake. 
And when I 
wish to call one back a 
smile would win the 
day— 
I 
need but look upon his face and coaxingly this say: 
Dance me on your knee, &c. 
I 
want to find a 
lover that will undertake the task, 
And understand just what I 
want, and never have to ask. 
If such can recommend himself I 
pray don't backward be, 
But be sure you're brave and strong enough to dance me 
on your knee. 
There's many a 
wish a 
young girl has she don't like to 
express. 
There's many a 
time we answer no, and heartily mean 
yes. 
I 
always warn the fellows when we are sitting all alone, 
Be sure don't rumple up my clothes, when you dance me 
on your knee. 
Dance me on your knee, Sze.

Oh! It's Awfully Wrong To Be Poor. 
A* sung by America's own Vocalist, TONIC "'Aaron, with great 
success, His latest hit. 
I 
am a 
dreadful character, in vice I 
go the pace, 
I'll give a 
start to any man„ and win an easy race; 
I've galloped helter-skelter through the catalogue of 
crimes, 
Committed theft and perjury at least a 
dozen times; 
I've had my fling at forgery, at felony and fraud, 
And when I 
go marauding, you can bet I 
do maraud ; 
But I 
mver condescended, though of crime I've made 
a 
tour. 
To the greatest crime in Christendom—the crime of 
being poor. 
CHORUS: 
And that 
how I 
keep from detection, 
If you give it a 
moment's reflection 
You all will agree 
In this precept with me, 
That it's awfully wrong to be poor; 
For the rich oft may sin, 
While the poor get run in, 
Ohl its awful' wrong to be poor. 
Fv:_: been a 
bank director, and the bank it went to 
smash, 
For we played at speculation with a 
lot of poor folk's 
cash; 
I've got up little swindles in the shape of silver mines, 
And sold the juice of cabbage stalks as port and sherry 
11.10:e • 
(CONTINUED) 
I've manufactured butter out of railway grease and 
fat, 
But I 
go to church on Sundays, and I 
always smell 
my hat; 
My balance at my bankers makes my dodges safe and 
sure. 
The safest sort of roguery is to rob and cheat the poor. 
OHOYIUS: 
And that's how I 
keep from detection, 
If you give it a 
moment's reflection 
You all will agree 
In this precept with me, 
That it's safest to swindle the poor; 
For the rich make a 
row, 
But the poor folks we cow, 
So it's safest to swindle the poor. 
If my little game were murder, still I'd keep my maw-
leys clean, 
I 
could bribe my poorer brothers—monarchs do the 
same, I 
ween ; 
When their neighbor's land kings covet, what's about 
the price they pay? 
Don't they send men out to rob him at a 
bob a 
bead a 
day? 
Bother guilt upon your conscience, if you've gold 
inside your purse, 
You can be as bad as I 
am, and, in fact, a 
little worse; 
Wealth can make the wicked honored, and give beauty 
to the boor, 
But you mustn't be a 
villain if you happen to be poor. 
And that's how I 
keep, etc.

You will miss me, darling Chloe, when I 
sleep beneath the 
sod, 
When the Summer winds are murmuring o'er the lea; 
You will think of me in kindness as life's weary road you 
plod, 
When my spirit rests from pain and sorrows free. 
For the sands of life are slowly ebbing, darling, with the 
tide, 
And soon these bones will mingle with the clay; 
In the winter of your sorrow you will think of how I 
died. 
And you'll miss me, Chloe, when I 
am laid away. 
CHORUS: 
For old Uncle Tom is feeble and old age has bent him low, 
Old master calls, he can no longer stay; . 
His limbs are getting weary and his eyes are growing dim, 
But you'll miss me, Chloe, when I 
am laid away. 
You must tell our little children that. their father dwells 
above, 
With the angels now he walks the golden stai:; 
You must tell them how I 
kissed them with a 
fond and 
sacred love, 
They must try and meet their poor old father there. 
And when the Judge his trumpet sounds from realms of 
bliss on high, 
And the morning of the great day comes at last, 
I 
will meet you, darling Chloe, and together you and 
Nivr ••o 
longer dread December's Wint'ry blast.

We are two gallant soldier boys 
That you very seldom meet; 
And though we never refuse a

We were never known to treat. 
We work the lunch routes every day, 
And get taffy on a

From the fellows that's fly, they give as the guy, 
But we're never known to kick. 
CHORUS. 
Major Magoozlum, just from Jerusalem, 
Where we've been training the Turks how to fight; 
They call us two guagers, the Judge and the Major, . 
But still we go mashing the girls all night. 
We never get cranky, for Moody and Sankey 
Told us it was a 
sin; 
'We never do fight, if ever v. e're tight, 
But at our work we begin. 
We draws the cans from under our coats, 
And drain the kegs for beer; 
We drink it quite sly, and wink our left eye.

CUMBERLAND'S CREW. 
Sung with great success by Devlin & Tracy. 
Oh ! shipmates, come, gather and join in My ditty, 
It's of a 
terrible battle that happened of late ; 
Let each good Union-Tar shed a 
sad tear of pity, 
When he thinks of the once gallant Cumberland'. fate. 
The eighth day of March told a 
terrible story, 
And many a 
brave tar to this world bid Adieu! 
Yet our Flag it was wrapt in a 
mantle of glory, 
By the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's crew. 
On that ill-fated day about ten in the morning. 
The sky it was clear, and bright shone the sun; 
The drums of the Cumberland sounded a 
warning 
That told every seaman to stand by his gun. 
An Iron- clad Frigate down on us came bearing, 
And high in the air the Rebel Flag flew; 
The Pennant of Treason she proudly was waving. 
Determined to conquer the Cumberland's crew. 
Then up spoke our Captain with stern resolution, 
Saying: my boys, of this monster now don't be dismayed. 
We swore to maintain our beloved Constitution, 
And to die for our country we are not afraid ! 
We fight for the Union, our cause it is glorious, 
to the Stars and Stripes we will stand ever true; 
'We'll sink at our quarters, or conquer victorious ! 
Was answered,with cheers,from the Cumberland's crelA 
Now our gallant ship fired her guns' dreadful thunder, 
Her broad-side, like hail, on the Rebel did pour. 
The people gazed on, struck with terror and wonder, 
The shots struck her sides and glanced harmless o'er; 
CUM BERLAND'S CREW. -
--Continued. 
But the pride of our Navy could never be daunted, 
Tho' the dead and the wounded her deck they did strew; 
And the Flag of the Union, how proudly it flaunted, 
Sustained by the blood of the Cumberland's crew. 
Slowly they sunk beneath Virginia's waters, 
Their voices on earth will ne'er be heard more--
They'll be wept by Columbia's brave sons and fair daughters 
May their blood be avenged on Virginia's shore !— 
In that battle stained grave they are silently lying— 
Their souls have forever to earth bid Adieu !— 
But the Star-Spangled Banner above them is flying, 
it was nailed to the mast by the Cumberland's crew. 
They fought us three hours, with stern resolution, 
Till those Rebels found cannon would never avail them. 
For the Flag of Secession has no power to gall them, 
Tho' the blood from their scuppers it crimsoned the tide; 
She struck us amid- ship, our planks she did sever, 
Her sharp iron-prong pierced our noble ship through; 
And still, as they sank on that dark rolling river, 
We'll die at our guns ! cried the Cumberland's crew. 
Columbia's sweet birth- right of Freedom's communion, 
Thy Flag never floated so proudly before; 
l'or the spirits of those that died for our Union, 
Above its broad folds now exaltingly soar!— 
And when our sailors in battle assemble, 
God bless our dear Banner: the Red, White and Blue! 
Beneath its bright Stars we'll cause tyrants to tremble. 
Or sink at our guns, like the Cumberland's crew,

JAMES O'NEIL'S PARODY ON 
Grandmother's Chair. 
Revised and sung by JAMES O'NEIL, & JOHN CONROY, in all the-
leading Variety Theatres in the United States. 
My Grandfather he, at the age of 1,000 and- 3;-
He worked upon a 
farm catching bees; 
It was him discovered pie, and he had- a 
leather eye, 
And his necktie was a 
boardingh6use for fleas; 
His lungs was made of wood, and he never was any 
good, 
He could walk upon the water and never sink; 
His nose was very long, and his breath was very strong, 
He'd chew up porous plasters, soap and ink.-
Cuonus: 
'But now he has departed, he bought a 
pair of wings to fly,. 
Now he's painting clouds and frescoing the sky; 
He'd never refuse a 
drink, and he always had blues, 
And when he died he left Dr. Tanner his old pair of shoes. 
When he grew up to be a 
man, he had five toes upon 
each hand, 
And he married a 
girl called .Arrabella Green; 
They were married just one year, and don't you think 
it queer, 
They had a 
family the finest ever seen; 
While smoking a 
clay pipe, his eldest boy named Mike. 
Was playing with a 
puzzle made of blocks; 
When seven million dollars and 3,000 paper collars, 
Fell out of my Grandfather's socks. 
(Chorus). 
He was never known to eat, he had 14 set of teeth. 
And he never wore pants in all his life; 
He was crossed in his thumbs, he had whiskers on his 
gums, 
And with lee cream he tried to choke his wife; 
One day he pawned his eye for to buy some rock and rye, 
He got wrestling with a 
brick and broke his head; 
He slept upon a 
box, he never changed his socks, 
And now I'm told the poor old man is dead. 
(Chorus).

THE OLD FASHIONED HOME. 
Sang by Nn BARRY at HARRIGAN 4,4: HART'S Theatre Comique. 
Broadway, New York. 
There's an old fashioned house in the old country. 
There's an old fashioned couple live there; 
There's an old fashioned gate by the old country road 
And an old fashioned man near the chair; 
An old fashioned woman is sitting there, 
Darning an old pair of hose; 
With her old fashioned cap on her old fashioned head 
And she's dressed in her old fashioned clothes. 
CHORUS: 
Bear those bells, those merry bells, 
And they fill my soul with a 
thrill; 
'Tis the old fashioned sound from them old fashioned bells, 
In that old fashioned church on the hill. 
There's an old fashioned clock on that old whitewashed 
With its old fashioned pendulum and hands; 
There's an old wooden bench by that old fireplace. 
With its bright copper kettles and pans; 
An old fashioned man is sitting there, 
Smoking his old fashioned clay; 
With his old favorite dog sitting close by his side, 
Watching the children at play. 
Heaven bless that dear old pair, may they live for many 
years, 
In that dear, little house in the lane; 
May they never know a 
care, but all happiness`to share 
And think of the dear, old happy days; 
The same I 
wish to you, with a 
heart of conscience true 
May you live, yes, for many, many years; 
May you never want for wealth, but enjoy the best of 
health, 
It is the earliest wish I 
;
sire to you.

THE COMMERCIAL DRUMMER. 
As represented in Mr. Curtis' great play of " Samuel of Posen," 
published by permission of and copyrighted, 1881. by '• Bruns

Kaufmann," N. Y. The great sensation of the season. 
Price, Words and Music. 40 cents. 
The happiest man you ever met, 
Is the drummer on the road; 
His words are gay to all you bet, 
In spinning yarns he's great; 
He sweetly smiles " Good day, Sir," 
And offers a 
cigar, 
But when that part is over, oh, 
Then begins the war. 
CtOrttS. — Machshovis he has plenty, 
And lots of stuff that's bad; 
But if you speak against his goods, 
Oh don't he then get mad. 
He travels east, north, south and west, 
In weather bad or fair; 
The smoking car he likes the best, 
For there he's free from care; 
He sells his goods, enjoys himself, 
And takes in every town, 
And if he's caught in telling fibs. 
He's sure to laugh it down. 
,uspenders gay and garters bright, 
And collars large and small; 
And other goods of many styles, 
To suit the short and tall; 
" 
halven" dollar he calls cheap, 
When an offer he does make, 
But if a " quavdter " you should bid, 
The bid he's sure to take, 
He dresses well and with good taste, 
Is always on the mash; 
And socially he is " immense," 
As the firm puts up the cash; 
In every town he has a 
girl, 
With whom he's dead in love, 
And taffy by the barrel he gives, 
This charming turtle dove,

GOD BLESS OUR DEAR OLD FLAG. 
Dedicated to my esteemed friend Miss C. E. DE 
SHEPPARD, 
with best wishes. 
Original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS, at 
the New National Theatre, Philadelphia. 
IN this glorious land of freedom, exciting times have been, 
I 
often picture in my mind, each great and stirring scene. 
I 
never looked upon the place, where our starry flag did fly, 
But the great events of by-gone days, to picture them I'd try. 
'Twas a 
noble sight at Yorktown. when Washington did stand. 
And took the sword from that great lord, who did invade our 
native land. 
He tried his best to win the fight, and low our banner drag. 
But the Yankee boys rose in their might, and saved our den' 
old flag. 
Again when shot and heit they flew, like hailstones thick awl 
fast, 
A 
gallant youth he braved them all as he clung to the mast. 
He seized our country's emblem, which had been shot away, 
And waved it in the foeman's face, way down in Mobile bay, 
A Yankee cheer it then went up, in triumph from our fleet, 
And soon the enteny gave way, defeated, cowed and beat, 
The boy descended to the deck, of Farragut we brag, 
And every brave tar with joy cried out, " God bless our dear 
own old flag." 
Again when trouble came us o'er, and darkest was the licur. 
A 
noble general staunch and brave, he proved his mighty pcArer. 
He stood upon the battle plain, as thousands did him fight, 
His emblem was our Stars and Stripes, his motto " Truth and 
Right." 
Though treated bad by friends at borne, he scorned the fight to 
yield, 
He swore he'd win the victory, or perish on the field. 
He led his columns manfully, repelled each fierce attack, 
The battle was Antietam boys, the hero, Little Mac. 
And when the great Centennial came, each nation in this world, 
Did bless our glittering emblem, when its bunting wa.sirtfurrd. 
They eCtITIO from Asia's sandy plains, from Afric's burninelirne, 
From far Australia's lonely wilds, from Europe's sunny Rhine. 
They came to see the poor man's home, where the Sun sinks in 
the West, 
Where every wanderer finds a 
bed, and is with plenty blest. 
And when our banner bright went up, no tyrants flaunting rag, 
The =Atolls all with joy they cried, Siod bless that dear old flag!

I've been thinking to-day of the happy years ago, 
And the tears quickly gathered in my eyes; 
As I 
held within my hand a 
portrait and a 
flower. 
Tokens bound to me by many sacred ties. 
The picture is my mothers, and she sent it cross the

And a 
blessing to her wandering son she gave; 
Au4 this little faded flower blossomed on the grassy

For they sent me a 
rose from gLotiva's grave.

Wt,e.fa you kneel down in prayer near the spot where 
she's laid, 
Remember this favor that I 
crave; 
Oh! take from the holy ground a 
blossom from the 
mound, 
And send me a 
rose from mothers grave. 
I 
would give all this world if it were mine to give, 
If my mother could return to me again; 
I 
would strive then to repay her many acts of love, 
For my heart is calling, and it calls in vain. 
Never more to feel her kisses and her words of bright-
est cheer; 
When she bid me hope, be patient, true and brave, 
And I 
keep my little flower ever near where e'er I 
go, 
For it blossomed on my angel mother's grave.

friends always bless us, 
When golden success p-,ilds our way, 
How they smile as they softly address us 
So cordial, good humor'd and gay. 
But, oh I 
if the sun ( 1' prosperity 
has set, then how quickly they frown, 
And cry out in tones of severity, 
Kick the man, don't you see he is down?

So let all your hearts be hone..t and true, 
And do unto others as yoq'd have them to do; 
Sickness and sorrow n•ay a1l unto you, 
So lift up a

What if, when you had not a

Your heart was as even as day, 
Your friends when they want . d

You'd oblige, and ne'er ask them to pay 
What, if then, a

You wander about through the town 
Your friend became very near sighted 
And don't seem to see you when down.

" 
I 
am papa's baby boy," thus said a 
little child 
As he toddled about on the floor, 
-While on his sunny face a mi 
did brightly shine 
As those words he repcatA1 o'er and o'er; 
They sounded sweet and pretty as they fell from his lips, 
Each word was full of love and joy, 
And I 
prayed in my heart that God would spare the life 
Of papa's lithe baby boy. 
C
_:/10:11US. 
Oh, bow map" ihings the children may do 
If their little hands they rightly employ, 
And how much joy and :- unshine there is in a 
nome 
Where thcre's a 
little baby boy. 
When the great Master was here upon earth, 
The ehildrcu he loved to behold; 
lie took tin in Luderiy up in his arms, 
And called them th lambs of his fold. 
Oh, may our IT.;:r:v;:rily Father watch o'er papa's baby boy, 
And keep Ent I:oin harm every day; 
And as from childhood to manhood he grows, 
he walk in the blessed narrow way. ( Chorus). 
Written for and sung by MR. Wm. 31cALoozi with great success. 
Eileen, sweet Eileen, oh cruel the fate, 
Sweet maiden, that tore us apart; 
Sadly I 
watch for you, early and late, 
Come back to me, star of my heart; 
No one can love you so fondly as I, 
Or no one so faithful can be; 
Life I 
would give for a 
glance of your eye, 
Oh come back my darling to me. 
Cuonts: 
No one can love you so fondly as I, 
Or no one so faithful can be; 
Life I 
would give for a 
glance of your eye, 
Oh come back my darling to me. 
Cruel the parents that caused us to part, 
Sweet Eileen, because I 
was poor; 
But richer than gold was the love of my heart, 
And brighter than jewels, asthore; 
Do not forget me, my darling Eileen, 
In that far off land of the free; 
Faithful and true to yottr memory I've been, 
Oh come back swect Eileen to me.

Some folks in this wide world are never content, 
With a 
nice little wife and no money; 
But love can't be bought, it will go where 'tis sent, 
Love and poverty, kisses and honey. 
So we must abide by the decrees of fate, 
Dame Fortune is tending the switch; 
I 
trust she'll be kind to the unfortunate, 
But I'd sooner be lucky than rich. 
I'd sooner be lucky than rich. 
I'd sooner be lucky than rich, 
Though it's nice to have wealth, 
I'd rather have health, 
So I'd sooner be lucky than rich. 
I 
know a 
young man who has plentfi of gold, 
And he loves a 
young girl to distraction; 
He offered his fortune to her I 
am told, 
For her pretty face was the attraction. 
Another young fellow who has not a 
cent, 
This charming young lass does bewitch; 
They live upon love in a 
cheap tenement, 
Oh, I'd sooner be lucky than rich.

Written by Jerry Cohan and sung with great success by

The secret order of old bums, for gall will take the cake, 
They recognize the pass word, it's " What'll you have to 
take ?" 
We likes to drink, we likes to eat, and don't waste drops 
or crumbs, 
Cops and rounders all are on to the order of old bums. 
CHORUS. 
The first degree— charge it to me—then your eye you 
wink. 
"rhe bottle tip, the glass you grip— password—What Wye 
drink? 
For the hack of your neck and the seat of your pants. 
The landlord gently comes, 
And lands you on the sidewalk in the order of old bums. 
When the little cop is staying, in some door way for 
snooze. 
The " Bums - are on the war- path laying, 
For a 
lunch, a 
grasshopper, or booze, booze, booze. 
The watermelon season for a 
change will sometimes suit; 
An when we can't get soft shell crabs why then we'll 
tackle fruit. 
We work the bar for all it's worth till the landlord for UR 
comes, 
We furnish politicians from the order of old bums; 
In the spring time and the summer, 
To the green fields and hen roosts off we goes,, 
But in the winter the poor bummer, 
Must hustle in the jail for feed and clothes. I 
suppose. 
The object of this order is to walk when we can't ride, 
.Nnd fill ourselves with lager from the empty keg outside, 
We smoke the best Havana buts, and share ' em with our 
chums. 
And an unprotected clothesline is a Christmas for thee 
bums. 
THIRD DEGREE sET TO. 
At election time it is our oyster— 
To the polls we gently, gently stray,

DAN DORkINS." 
[Burlesque Poem.] 
As delivered by PAT ROONEY, the peoples' favorite, with rounds of 
applause. 
The theatre was full, and so was the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
bare-footed slack wire clog, 
For he was the pompey round here. 
The bar-room was perfectly crowded with beats, 
Who waited a 
pleasant surprise; [ out, 
For they knew they would eat when the lunch was set 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose and so did the people, 
Who commenced for to shout and hurrah; 
Dan Dorkins cam - out with young Oliver Twist, 
And they give him the laugh and " Yah, yahr 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure; 
"He's away oil his base," says old Joe Jewell, 
Who never went back on the poor. 
A 
brick! yes, it was! I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark-red for two; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
And continually dropping his cue. 
He says: 
I'm a 
king!" when a woman jumped up 
And says: " You lie, vou are one of the gang!" 
It knocked Dorkins cola, he owed her for washing, 
And his head on his breast he did hang. 
At length to the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
lf I 
have not drank enough Bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer; 
When O'Leary and I 
walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish ould ' Sam Satidford' was here. 
You insult me to-night, and say I 
am sober, 
Let Tony Pastor play Hamlet alone;

know you won't laugh, 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead drunk at home,"

On a

pursued my way, 
As happy as a

That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest,' and concluding with her 
name. 
Such a 
pretty letter, with its perfume sweet, 
Cupid's with their arrows loving hearts to meet, 
Lots of blots for kisses, and a 
seal of blue, 
Meaning that my love is true to you.

That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with litr

Now who the letter came from I 
of course must tell, 
A 
charming little maiden, and her name is Belle, 
She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea. 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand 
The feelings of my heart, when loving letters reach your hand, 
How 
you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart she has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
For on a 
bright summer, S:c. 
Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a 
ship that's sailing o'er the dark blue sea. 
Will bring me such a 
letter, from my sweetheart it will be. 
Then when we are married, I 
will write you all the news, 
Tell you how we get along, and never have the blues, 
What a 
little treasure wife I 
got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L-0-V- E.

On nature's bosom fall,

Copyrighted by A. J. Fistiga, 1831. 
I 
came to-night to see my girl, 
Oh, she is such a 
sweet dove; 
Her wool is straight, her lips do curl, 
Sue Sanders is this coon's love. 
Her form is like a 
cask of ale. 
Such a 
beauty is this dear dove; 
She weighs a 
ton, she's very pale, 
She's all mine, she's my own love.

Oh, this daisy is my own love, 
A 
sweet dove, a

There's no wench like this coon's love, 
She's the girl I 
came to see. 
Come before it is too late. 
To the ball we both will go, love; 
Our style will make excitement great. 
We'll take the cake when there, love. 
Oh, won't we have a 
jolly time, 
You bet we'll have some fun, love; 
We darkies there will cut a 
shine, 
We beat them all on style, love. 
CHORUS: 
We'll cut the pigeon wing, love, 
sing love, well swing, love. 
When the darkies see us there, love 
There will be music in the air.

Mrs. McNally had sixteen shirts upon a 
clothes line, 
And a 
brand new suit of dresses from the store, 
Young Kelly's son he stole them and he pawned them, 
You can bet . she chased the young kid from the door. 
Last night her daughter Mary Ann the speeler, 
Was standing with a 
young matt she met before, 
some one dropped out a 
scuttle full of cinders, 
To chase the dizzy lovers from the door, 
The milk is left up in the hallway every morning, 
From Jacob McCarthy's german grocery store, 
When he tries to collect his bill they give him warning, 
And chase the poor old milkman from the door.

To shut he p!ayhouse doors;

Oh, her name it is Matilda Awful Gaul, 
She was decorated with two black eyes; 
She worked in a 
German brewery shoving froth 
lager beer, 
And in a 
tenement she was muzzling 
CHORUS: 
Then it's lovely, cross-eyed Cinder Ella, 
Just as fat as a 
one dollar umbrella; 
You have won my heart, and stole my watch and chain. 
You have swelled my pocketbook for bottles of wine; 
I 
will meet you in the gutter outside the slaughter house. 
About twenty minutes after half-past nine, 
We met her bottling fog upon the river, 
And received an invitation to have a 
dinner; 
Her breath it was so stron *; 
it turned ice into hot water, 
And her noe was red from being a 
terrible ginner. 
She lived seven flights upstairs in an alley, 
We took the cars anri soon got to the top; 
She collared all my money and stabbed me in the neck, 
And then was going to shoot me with a 
pop. 
(Chorus).

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is .a Pao simile of a Trick practiced by celt 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged SO Systematically, and is 4cconi-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
_Matt what a 
leading Journat says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordeo 
has been sent us, called licar.Pric DMIPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
mice of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap. 
pear to be filled with copies of only ono picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tessellated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Biding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A 
little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at,home in the hand-
ling of it."-"Phila. Evening Bulletin.'
