HOLCOMB, TERRY 
Interviewed by Christopher Sims 
September 29, 2017 
 
SIMS: 
00:00:05 
I've got a couple going here. Just basically backups.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:00:09 
Okay.  
SIMS: 
00:00:09 
Of course, now you can do everything on your phone too.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:00:15 
Oh, yeah. Who else have you talked to? Is Tommy the first one? 
SIMS: 
00:00:27 
Brenda Wineland. She does media on the battlefield. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:00:32 
Oh, okay. Yeah.  
SIMS: 
00:00:34 
And then I'm talking to Brenda Tabor, I think her name is, 
tomorrow and- 
HOLCOMB: 
00:00:40 
Belinda Tabor?  
SIMS: 
00:00:41 
Yeah.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:00:42 
Yeah.  
SIMS: 
00:00:42 
And then on Monday, it's Gary Downs? Terry Downs. He's a 
retired Colonel, I think. It seems like a lot of people know him.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:00:53 
Yeah. I'm trying to think. Did you say you were talking to Buck? 
SIMS: 
00:01:04 
Buck Halley? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:01:04 
Yeah.  
SIMS: 
00:01:05 
Yeah. We haven't connected. We haven't met up yet.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:01:07 
Okay.  
SIMS: 
00:01:07 
So, I'm hoping to [crosstalk 00:01:09]. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:01:08 
Yeah. Buck's a good guy.  
SIMS: 
00:01:10 
He's all the way down in Lake Charles, I think.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:01:12 
Mm-hmm (affirmative).  
SIMS: 
00:01:17 
So, the first question is just to get the levels out.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:01:20 
Okay.  
SIMS: 
00:01:20 
If you could just tell me what you had for breakfast? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:01:21 
What I had for breakfast this morning? 
SIMS: 
00:01:24 
Yeah.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:01:24 
A cherry snack pie.  
SIMS: 
00:01:29 
One of those Hostess ones? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:01:31 
Right.  
SIMS: 
00:01:34 
What about lunch? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:01:36 
Lunch I had a corned beef sandwich.  
SIMS: 
00:01:40 
From Arby's? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:01:41 
No. From out of my dinner bucket. I made it myself.  
SIMS: 
00:01:47 
All right. I think we're good to go. If we could start, if you could 
say and then spell your name? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:01:55 
Okay. Terry D. Holcomb. T-E-R-R-Y, Holcomb, H-O- L-C-O-M-B. 
Everyone knows me by T.D. I go by my first two initials.  
SIMS: 
00:02:07 
And tell me about where you grew up and if your family had any 
connection to the military.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:02:15 
Yes. I grew up in a small town in southeastern Oklahoma called 
Heavener. It's about 45 miles from Fort Chaffee. My dad was in 
World War II and Korea and I joined the service and when I got 
out of the service, I was 45 miles from JRTC, went right to work 
for JRTC and thought I was never going to move again. I had a 
good job right at home, and then ended up a couple of years 
later, I was in Fort Polk, Louisiana.  
SIMS: 
00:02:43 
So, what was your MOS for your job? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:02:45 
I was a glorified grunt. I was an airborne infantryman.  
SIMS: 
00:02:49 
Okay. And how long were you in for? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:02:52 
Seven years.  
SIMS: 
00:02:57 
And why did you decide to leave after seven years? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:03:00 
I blew a knee out on a jump and I didn't like the real leg army. 
So, the airborne army, we were always deployed, always gone. 
It was a lot more fun and exciting than the regular garrison type 
army.  
SIMS: 
00:03:17 
Right. So, when you were in the army, did you have any training 
that was like what soldiers do at Fort Polk? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:03:30 
We would do a little bit of O.P.F.O.R. training. We had 
absolutely no civilians on the battlefield type training. 
Everything was one platoon out of a company were the 
aggressors and it was all ... There was no such thing as civilians 
on the battlefield or no one even cared about collateral damage 
back then.  
SIMS: 
00:03:53 
So, what time period is this, the seven years you were in? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:03:57 
'79 to '86.  
SIMS: 
00:04:02 
And then, what did you do right after the army? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:04:09 
When I came out of the army, I worked for the Corps of 
Engineers for a while and then Fort Polk, or excuse me, Fort 
Chaffee started recruiting people for this new thing called JRTC 
and I went to work at JRTC as a firemarker at first.  
SIMS: 
00:04:25 
And was JRTC at Fort- 
HOLCOMB: 
00:04:28 
Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, yeah.  
SIMS: 
00:04:29 
Okay. So, how long had it been there? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:04:32 
It started very, very small in 1986 and it grew in baby steps. But 
actually it was kind of baby steps until it got down here to Fort 
Polk in 1993. I mean, the rotations were tiny compared to even 
a normal rotation on Fort Polk there. We were training 
battalions there where we started out training brigades here, 
so.  
SIMS: 
00:05:00 
And what was the thinking when they set that up? What was 
the need they felt they needed to do? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:05:08 
Well, there was nowhere for the light fighters to train. Even 
back then, you had JOTC, which was in Fort Sherman, Panama, 
the Jungle Operations training center, and then NTC was already 
up and running, but as far as the light infantrymen or airborne 
infantrymen, the light fighters, non-MEC people, there was no 
place fort them to go to train. You could go to NTC and on the 
big mass tank battle, no matter how many helicopters you had, 
no matter what, the tanks are going to run right through you. 
You just can't kill them fast enough. And there was just no place 
for the light fighters to train, so there needed to be a light 
fighter training center.  
SIMS: 
00:05:52 
And what was your specific job there? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:05:54 
I started out as a firemarker. They replicate all the indirect fires, 
the mortar fire, artillery fire. Nowadays, they do mostly IED type 
things, but back then it was mortar fire, artillery fire, aircraft 
bombs. Even the scenario at the time, the island scenario, they 
even had naval gunfire they would ...  
SIMS: 
00:06:18 
And did they have physical structures, like for buildings and 
stuff? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:06:23 
At Fort Chaffee? 
SIMS: 
00:06:23 
Yeah.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:06:24 
We had two small villages. One was named Carnis just like the 
one here. We brought that name with us.  
SIMS: 
00:06:30 
What's the name? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:06:31 
Carnis.  
SIMS: 
00:06:33 
C-A-R-N [crosstalk 00:06:34]. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:06:34 
C-A-R-N-I-S, yeah. And the other was called Lone Star because 
that was the name of the little area on the post it was, so.  
SIMS: 
00:06:43 
And are those villages still there? Do you know? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:06:46 
I really don't know. I'm almost positive they are because 
Arkansas National Guard uses that to train, so I'm sure they 
probably use it in their training and stuff and Fort Chaffee itself 
trains some of the new transports stuff, so.  
SIMS: 
00:07:06 
And did they have basically role players or [crosstalk 00:07:13] 
HOLCOMB: 
00:07:12 
Not in the beginning. In the beginning they had army 
augmentees and that's one of the reasons that the army looked 
for a professional role player, if you will, is because they would 
bring a battalion down and just like home station training, they 
would make a company out of that battalion role players or a 
company out of a sister battalion. They would be the role 
players in the villages.  
SIMS: 
00:07:38 
Okay.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:07:38 
Well, you know, if you're a young SPC 4 or E5 and you're the 
mayor of a village and your battalion commander comes in, 
you're not going to be upset with him because in two weeks 
you're going to go back and he's going to bring [inaudible 
00:07:54] on you. So, it didn't matter what the units did, it was 
all good. So, the army realized there was a need for someone 
who wasn't cowled down by the senior leadership of whatever 
unit was in there training, so. And we actually started role play 
in January of 1992. That was the first official civilians on the 
battlefield. Actually, we still had army augmentees out there, 
but we portrayed the key characters and there was a whopping 
12 of us.  
SIMS: 
00:08:29 
And you were one of the 12? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:08:32 
One of the 12. Myself, there were 12 of us, three of us full-time, 
nine part-time, and the three of us were the nuclei of what ...  
SIMS: 
00:08:43 
Right. So, what were some of the things ... I'm sure with all this 
it got better as you did more and more. What were some of the 
initial obstacles that came up that you had to figure out how to 
do better? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:08:58 
It was mainly learning the island scenario. Staying in character 
was really kind of hard because you almost had to relearn 
where you had ... Are you from North Carolina originally?  
SIMS: 
00:09:19 
No.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:09:21 
Okay. Whatever state you're from, you probably had that state 
history. 
SIMS: 
00:09:24 
Right.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:09:24 
I had Oklahoma history and down here you have Louisiana 
history, so you almost had to have Cortina history where you 
could talk about back in 19-whatever, this happened, and that 
was one of the key things that we really had to work on and 
stress was you really had to live to where when you were 
talking, something didn't come out that happened ...  
SIMS: 
00:09:52 
Right. So, it's a lot of acting basically.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:09:52 
Right.  
SIMS: 
00:09:52 
... was a big part of it, which is probably not something that ... 
HOLCOMB: 
00:09:55 
Right. And for those of us that had been in the military and 
there was two or three of us that had gotten out fairly recently, 
about our third rotation there, the major, the S3, the training 
officer of the unit that we were training was my old platoon 
leader. So, he looks at me and I look at him, and he understood 
and when it was all over, we got together and ...  
SIMS: 
00:10:26 
Well, was there still ... Either still in that case, you knew the 
actual person, but even if not, you weren't that far removed 
from the military.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:10:36 
Right.  
SIMS: 
00:10:36 
Was it difficult to be mad at people who used to be your senior? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:10:44 
If they were really doing something stupid, you learn not to get 
mad, you learn to more to be disappointed that you're thinking 
they know better than that. Over the years, you would see the 
same units come through and some units progressed greatly 
from one rotation to the next, even with new people and some 
just kind of did the same silly things over and over it seemed 
like.  
SIMS: 
00:11:15 
So, what would you attribute that to? Are there qualities in the 
leaders that you noticed that would make the fighting force 
more effective to train? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:11:30 
Yeah and it's like a civilian job. If you have a good boss, you 
want to come to work, you want to do a good job. And you 
could tell a lot by the way the unit would act from down to the 
lowest man, how some of their leadership was and I'm sure it's 
still the same way today. You can tell a unit that's got some 
good leadership. They stand out.  
SIMS: 
00:12:01 
Right. I think in big organizations. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:12:04 
Right.  
SIMS: 
00:12:06 
Right. So, early ... This is just my guess, so correct me if I'm 
wrong. Now, there's OCs and there's probably other cultural 
people who advise. My guess is there wasn't all that human 
infrastructure early on? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:12:24 
We had a major that was ... He was our mentor, if you will. He 
was PSYOPS, a civil affairs PSYOPS, belonged to [inaudible 
00:12:39], which was headquartered at Bragg. He belonged to 
that outfit, which Civil Affairs deals mainly with COB, so he was 
their senior type OC type guy on the ground and he worked 
with us and he was the one that would tell us, "Okay, the unit 
came in yesterday. They drove through your garden. They did 
this, they did that. So, you were happy to see them. They did 
that, so today, you're mad."  
HOLCOMB: 
00:13:10 
So, we were getting our guidance and in the early days, it was 
almost all, we called it freeplay. You had a basic, this is what's 
happening, and you had certain events that you made happen 
on certain days, but your reaction was all based on how the unit 
treated you. So, if you're welcoming them with open arms and 
they kick your doors in and shoot your goat and tear up your 
garden, well now your open arms are not open anymore. So 
when they would have their AAR, they would say, "Look, this 
town, they welcomed you, they had all this intel to give up. 
When you came in, treated them like this, you've got none of 
this intel, which would have made life so much easier for you. 
So, that was their learning tool, so.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:14:06 
And vice versa, if they come in to a red village, which is a hostile 
village and they work stern with us or whatever, then we would 
throw grenades at them and stuff like that when they turned 
their back, so.  
SIMS: 
00:14:26 
Did they have M.I.L.E.S. gear back then? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:14:27 
Oh, yeah. It was the legacy M.I.L.E., the old M.I.L.E., but yes, we 
did.  
SIMS: 
00:14:34 
Can you describe what the island scenario was? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:14:41 
The island was called The Island of Atlantica. Cortina was the 
friendly country, Atlantica was the unfriendly, hostile aggressor 
country, and then there was a neutral country called Victoria. 
Okay. And it took up, notionally on the map when you saw it, it 
was a big slice of eastern Oklahoma, big slice of western 
Arkansas, dipped down to like Texarkana, and went up into 
northern Arkansas pretty good. And they did that because even 
back then as you're actually playing physically in the Box, they 
have a wrap around scenario that things are happening to your 
sister units on either side of you, so they had to have a big 
picture for that to play.  
SIMS: 
00:15:37 
Were there actually units in those areas? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:15:40 
They are CPX units, Command Post Exercise, which is now called 
... God, I can't remember the name of it now. Anyway, it's still 
basically, it's computer games. Those units, their commanders 
and stuff are there, but they're playing board games on the 
computer with the troops. The scenario was that the Atlanticans 
were massed on the border, threatening to cross the border, 
the US sends troops in to the friendly Cortina. Well, once they 
get to Cortina, well then the Atlanticans, they finally crossed the 
border and the battle's on.  
SIMS: 
00:16:23 
Do you know what real-world country it was supposed to be? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:16:30 
There was no real-world country for Cortina. It was purely 
fictional. We could twist it to whatever ... We didn't have all the 
Hollywood stuff like they did here for Iraq and Afghani 
scenarios, the villages and stuff, but we could twist a scenario to 
whatever we wanted it to be. So, not too long ... '94 I guess it 
was, we were still doing the Cortina rotations even down here. 
We just took the Island of Atlantica and superimposed it on the 
terrain down here. But when the second ACR that used to be on 
Fort Polk went to Haiti, we transformed everything into Haiti. 
We put up fruit signs and everything. So, the JRTC Box can be 
manipulated to fit whatever the need may be.  
SIMS: 
00:17:35 
So, why did the JRTC move from Arkansas to here? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:17:45 
I'm guessing political concern. There was more land down here, 
but the land was limited use land, a lot of it were, where we 
were the only game in town. At Fort Chaffee we could use 
everything, nothing was off-limits. You didn't have some land 
you could use, some land couldn't dig on, some land ... So, I 
mean, honest to God, I don't know. It was part of the base 
realignment and closure. But I do know we had more accidental 
contacts trying to get people in position to have the war games 
here than we ever did at Chaffee. But now that it's here, it's a 
lot better. We've got more land now and it's a whole lot better 
now, but back then, who knows?  
HOLCOMB: 
00:18:34 
Everyone figured it was probably political because Fort Smith, 
Arkansas didn't fight to keep JRTC up there because they 
wanted the land. Fort Smith's a growing town, so they didn't 
really fight for anything. Fort Polk was losing pretty much 
everything they had in the base realignment and closure so they 
were begging for JRTC to come down here. So, it was a win/ win 
for everyone, so.  
SIMS: 
00:19:02 
So, what was in what is now the Fort Polk Box before the JRTC 
moved? What did they use that for? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:19:11 
It was training. Just standard army training. All the ranges and 
units could have a field training exercise and it just wasn't the 
Box then, it was just like any other army base. You had training 
land. So, there was no specific training area or anything. You 
went and signed for the land and that was your land while your 
unit was in there.  
SIMS: 
00:19:39 
Now, do you remember seeing some World War II era 
clapboard houses at Fort Polk? And I know there was something 
called Tigerland? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:19:51 
Tigerland, that was during the Vietnam War. Tigerland was for 
... And it was called that because it was a mock Vietnamese 
village and it was up on Peason. Now, they actually trained out 
of North Fort and they still, the combat advisors the we had out 
there, and we still have a small footprint of them, but they call 
that Tigerland because that's where the units that were going to 
Vietnam were all training out of North Fort, but the actual 
Tigerland village was up on Peason up there, the mock village.  
SIMS: 
00:20:29 
And was there any of it left when you got here? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:20:33 
It's up there, but it's just, there's nothing standing. It's a couple 
of basic foundations and stuff. There's not really anything up 
there from my understanding.  
SIMS: 
00:20:46 
So, tell me a little bit about when it moved. Basically, since you 
were employed there, you came with? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:20:53 
Yeah. We actually came down. We did the first site survey in 
January of '93, myself, my supply guy ... I was trying to think, 
one other, I think my admin person. We came down on a site 
survey to see the buildings they were going to put us in that we 
were going to be housed in when we got down here, our offices 
and stuff. We went downrange and Carnis had just been 
completed in January of '93. Jettertown, which was the second 
village, was nothing but stacks of lumber. The lumber was there 
but nothing had been done with it and that was the only thing 
that was built. Geronimo Drop Zone, they still had dozers out 
there clearing it off. It was an old tank range, so they were 
clearing it off to get it ready.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:21:47 
The first rotation we did was ... I want to say August of '93. We 
finished up June of '93 at Chaffee. By that time I was coming 
down here out of rotation at Chaffee, staying down here until 
rotation started again. I would go back up there, finish rotation 
up there. Then July we had our ... I think I brought nine guys 
down with me, is what we ended up, nine people. We were up 
to 20-something, I think, 22 at that time from up there and I 
think nine of them came down and I used those nine. We hired 
25 in addition to that, was our first training class and we had 
that in July. Painted the villages, tried to get the two villages 
looking like something, and August we had our first rotation 
August of '93 down here.  
SIMS: 
00:22:50 
I'm really interested in how the construction started and all of 
that. Who decides where in the Box the villages are, what's in a 
village, and then at what point do you all take over and add 
details? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:23:11 
The Fort Polk engineers, the engineer liaison at that time, a guy 
named C.J. McCann, he was the one that ramrodded all the 
building and everything. He was a great guy. He was over 
everything from what villages went where. Of course, he went 
along with the COG, the Chief of Ops Group, the Commander of 
Ops Group and everything, but not only that, but where our 
offices were going to be, he was the engineer liaison for JRTC to 
the Missions Fort contract and he was a great guy and he 
retired here a few years back and they've got someone doing 
his job, but they have not replaced him, I'll put it that way. He 
was a great guy. He could keep more in his head than I could 
keep in a laptop. He didn't forget. You could tell him 20 things 
and he could spit 20 things back at you. You know what I mean? 
He was just very good at his job.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:24:12 
But the army planners, they would look at it and they had their 
long-range picture of what they wanted it to look like and they 
had to put the villages to where it would make more sense to 
where you actually had to where you could make a border that 
these villages were on the bad side, these villages were on the 
friendly side. And so tons of planning went in to where 
everything is.  
SIMS: 
00:24:40 
Was there a certain minimum mix of things in each village? I'm 
just guessing. Like a certain number of structures or a church or 
a mosque or ... ? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:24:53 
In the early days, there wasn't. The bigger villages had a church 
because that was one of the Sunday activities is the smaller 
villages came to the bigger villages to ... Sunday religious 
services. When we first started doing Iraqi/Afghani rotations, 
that's when every village pretty much had to have a mosque. 
But back in the old days, even when we had some smaller 
villages built, everyone still either went to Carnis or Jettertown 
on Sunday for church and that gave what they wanted. The 
picture of actual traffic moving back and forth and people going 
and coming, which one of the things they want out of role 
players is them moving, not just going ... Sit in a village and sit 
and wait for something to happen. They want, especially if the 
unit is kind of frozen in place not doing anything, well then you 
start sending role players through the unit to make them react.  
SIMS: 
00:25:57 
Where did the name Jettertown come from? What does that 
mean? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:26:00 
There were some people that was actually ... Have you heard of 
the heritage families here? 
SIMS: 
00:26:08 
I think I know what that is, but maybe you could explain it. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:26:10 
The people that were displaced when Camp Polk was built, the 
actual Jetter family lived in that area, so it become Jettertown. 
My wife is actually part of a heritage family. Her great-
grandfather was displaced.  
SIMS: 
00:26:28 
And Carnis I know came from [crosstalk 00:26:34]. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:26:34 
Yeah. Cortina, it's tied in to the history of Fort Smith, Arkansas. 
Do you know who William O'Darby was? 
SIMS: 
00:26:42 
No. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:26:43 
Darby's Rangers? They were the second rangers back in World 
War II.  
SIMS: 
00:26:43 
Mm-hmm (affirmative).  
HOLCOMB: 
00:26:48 
Okay. He was born and raised in Fort Smith, Arkansas.  
SIMS: 
00:26:50 
Is that paraglide? Didn't they do something with the 
paragliding?  
HOLCOMB: 
00:26:55 
I'm sure the paraglide did something with him in it, yeah, but he 
died in World War II. Anyway, he was born and raised in Fort 
Smith, Arkansas. He had the second rangers all the way through 
the Italian Campaign and all that. Well, there is a region of Italy 
called Cortina and that's where Darby spent a lot of his time 
during World War II was in that region, so that's where they got 
the Cortina from because of Darby having been born and raised 
there in Fort Smith, so.  
SIMS: 
00:27:30 
Right. And now it's used ...  
HOLCOMB: 
00:27:31 
Yeah. The flag, the Cortinian flag, is actually, it's a light Carolina 
blue. Since you're from Carolina, it's a Carolina blue. Not a Duke 
blue, but a Carolina blue, with a big white star. Okay. That is 
actually the flag of Somalia. When we went to Somalia, we're 
like, "Okay." But when they actually picked that flag, it was the 
Bonnie Blue flag- 
HOLCOMB: 
00:28:00 
... they picked that flag, it was the Bonnie Blue Flag from the 
Civil War, and they thought no one would ... At that time it was 
not a big deal, so they picked the Bonnie Blue Flag. It turns out 
we go to Somalia a few years later, and we're flying the Somali 
flag, because it's the exact same flag. 
SIMS: 
00:28:18 
That's confusing. Tell me a little bit about the heritage families. 
Like, how resonant, how strong, if any, is there any feeling left 
from, like, descendants? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:28:39 
Not so much. I mean, here just recently, they've had a big land 
purchase. They didn't force anyone off their land, like they kind 
of did in World War II, the eminent domain, and "This is a fair 
price. You have x days to take it." From what I understand, the 
last batch, if you were in the middle of it, and you didn't want to 
move, they just kept shoving money at you till you finally said, 
"Okay, I'm moving."  
HOLCOMB: 
00:29:16 
Yeah, they didn't, to the best of my knowledge, force it, which 
I'm sure there would have been a lot of uproar if they had tried 
to force someone. I think they just made it worth their while. 
Even though they might have been there a while, I guess the 
almighty green won out in the end. As far as I know, there 
weren't anyone that just said, "Hell, no, I'm not going." But, 
yeah, it was nothing like it was in World War II.  
SIMS: 
00:29:47 
Now, when they're buying more land, do they have specific 
ideas of what they're going to do for it, or is it just they're 
assuming that things will grow, and it's always good to have a 
buffer?  
HOLCOMB: 
00:30:03 
Well, that, and you need more room. The Army's a lot more 
mobile than it was ... Well, even the light fighters are more 
mobile than they were, even just a few years back, so you need 
more room to maneuver, even though the box was close to a 
100,000 acres, you had some that was limited use and you 
couldn't do this and you couldn't do that.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:30:28 
It needed to be a little bigger. Plus, it's all along the line of what 
they call the Yellow Brick Road, which is the tank trail, that goes 
up to Peason, so it's all tied together now. It makes one big 
continuous training area, so it's really good.  
SIMS: 
00:30:47 
So the limited use areas, why are they limited use? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:30:51 
Forest service land, government land, the government can use 
the government land, but we can't go in there and dig tank 
traps or stuff like that. They want to keep it ... You can train in it. 
You can drive through it. You can have a firefight in it, but they 
don't want permanent structures in it and or digging or anything 
like that in there. 
SIMS: 
00:31:14 
Is that on the like eastern side of the box? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:31:20 
It's actually the southern end, down here is what they call LUA, 
limited use area, and then up next to Peason is the Horse's 
Head limited use area up there.  
SIMS: 
00:31:33 
But the new land they're buying, that wouldn't be limited use?  
HOLCOMB: 
00:31:37 
To the best of my knowledge, it's not going to be because it's ... 
That was bought for the purpose of training.  
SIMS: 
00:31:46 
Going back to when you are ... the early days of being here, so 
maybe let's talk about prior to 9/11, with how ... What were the 
trainings like and the different scenarios, how did [crosstalk 
00:32:07] ... 
HOLCOMB: 
00:32:06 
We pretty much all ... Before 9/11, the scenarios were all almost 
the same. It went off of the old LIC, MIC, HIC, army model, light-
intensity conflict, medium-intensity conflict, heavy-intensity. It 
ramped up. The start of the rotation, there was just cross-
boarder excursions of the Atlanticans and just kind of guerrilla 
warfare stuff. Then it kind of ramped up to more intense, and 
then during the heavy intensity is when the tanks rolled across 
the border.  
SIMS: 
00:32:45 
Why do they do it in that order? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:32:48 
That was, I guess, the way the Army College, that most of our 
conflicts have progressed, I guess. We really haven't, other since 
World War II, when we jumped in, were forced in it, they've 
kind of gradually ramped up. You'd have to ask someone way 
senior to me.  
SIMS: 
00:33:12 
Now, so in the 90s, is there already a dedicated O.P.F.O.R.? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:33:16 
Yes, there's been a dedicated O.P.F.O.R. since day one. 
SIMS: 
00:33:19 
Okay, has that always been a 509th ... 
HOLCOMB: 
00:33:19 
509th, ...  
SIMS: 
00:33:28 
Then was there already a 509th here or was that part of ... 
HOLCOMB: 
00:33:32 
The actual 509, they came from Vicenza, Italy. That was where 
the 509th was. They were re-flagged to be the O.P.F.O.R. here, 
and Vicenza, they stood up the old 3rd [inaudible 00:33:55], 
173rd Airborne. They uncased their colors that had been cased 
since right after Vietnam to ... made them the 173rd. The 509th 
had a long heritage, so they wanted to keep it alive, so they 
made O.P.F.O.R. the 509th. Yeah, they've been O.P.F.O.R. since 
day one.  
SIMS: 
00:34:19 
Was there a ... like in the 90s, a sense ... Did it stay about the 
same size, or was it constantly growing? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:34:28 
It grew. Like I say, it grew a little bit at Chaffee, not a lot, 
because even when we started role playing in 92, there was 
already rumblings of base realignment, what's going to happen, 
so they didn't want to just really ... It was really strung out up 
there.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:34:48 
The intermediate staging base, which they use Alexandria now 
for that, they're actually building that on North Fort now as we 
speak. It was at Camp Gruber, Oklahoma. So they would land at 
Camp Gruber, at the field there, and then have to convoy down 
I40 to Fort Chaffee, so same thing here. They land at Alexandria, 
and then have to convoy on 28 down here.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:35:15 
So they're actually going to make it onto North Folk, so they can 
land here ... It's a cost savings. But up there everything was so 
spread out, the rumblings of what's the BRAC going to bring? 
Are we going to stay here? Are we going to move? Are we even 
going to exist? So they didn't really ... 
HOLCOMB: 
00:35:35 
We grew a little bit, but when we first got down here, like I say, 
we started out pretty small. I think we ended up, like I say, I had 
nine. We hired 25 more in the first training class. Less than six 
months we were up to 75. Then it just kind of grew. Our first 
huge rotation we did ... I want to say we did maybe 90, around 
95 or 96, I believe. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:36:09 
It was the First Partnership for Peace rotation. That's when the 
former Soviet block countries came over. We had a company 
from every country in the former Soviet block come in. We 
hired up a bunch of role players just for that specific ... Then we 
had another one of those. Then after 9/11 things escalated 
quickly, so we got big quick.  
SIMS: 
00:36:37 
Let me make sure I understand the Partnership for Peace, you 
would have an American training unit come in, and they would 
partner with like a [crosstalk 00:36:45] ...  
HOLCOMB: 
00:36:44 
Yeah, it was teaching the former Soviet block countries. We had 
what were called STIX lanes, Situational Training Exercises, so 
you would train say one of it ... One was a family squabble, a 
man supposedly has beaten his wife. The villages are all up in 
arms about it. What do you do? Well some of the ... It was 
almost comical. Some of the Soviet block countries come in 
there, shoot the husband, that's it, or shoot the wife even. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:37:20 
We'd train them what our version of what they should do. Then 
once all the units had gone through all these different 
situational training exercises, then they would have a rotation, 
and they would see all these things, these scenarios that they've 
seen during the situation exercises, we would interject them 
into the rotation. It was basically just showing them hey this is 
how NATO does it.  
SIMS: 
00:37:51 
Yeah, that reminds me of a story I heard from somebody at Fort 
Bragg. I think it was somebody from South America that was 
training. There was an insurgency in the village, what do you 
do? He was like, "You find two people, chop their heads off, and 
put them on a stake outside."  
HOLCOMB: 
00:38:10 
Right.  
SIMS: 
00:38:13 
Which he thought was the real answer.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:38:14 
Right, yeah, and we- 
SIMS: 
00:38:14 
[crosstalk 00:38:17] ... 
HOLCOMB: 
00:38:18 
Some of the Soviet block, their version of that was pretty close. 
You could tell it was ... They didn't play around very much at all.  
SIMS: 
00:38:35 
I don't know if you were on post on 9/11, but what happened? 
What was the experience that day or soon after? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:38:45 
We were actually ... I'm trying to think. That was Cubic had just 
got the contract. They were going to ... I'm trying to ... I believe 
that was the time period Cubic had got the contract, a company 
called TRW had had it. Cubic had one it. I was the first person to 
go over from TRW to the Cubic side, because the role play piece 
was ... It had so many moving parts.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:39:29 
TRW, they wanted ... I'm trying to remember now. They had a 
bunch of people for some reason or another weren't going to 
work. I think the army, that particular rotation, wanted say 
maybe 250 people. TRW was going to be like a 100 short, so I 
got wind of it, got a whole to the Cubic folks and said, "Hey, 
they're going to be short." We can pick up the slack here and 
jump right in. We actually had a 100 Cubic role players in with 
the TRW role players.  
SIMS: 
00:40:10 
This is during the transition of the contract? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:40:11 
It was during the transition. It was not supposed to ... One 
October was supposed to be the actual assumption day of 
Cubic, but this was obviously in September, and we were in a 
rotation. I remember the main thing was getting on post had 
become a lot harder. Before that it was ... It wasn't really an 
open post, but it was very basic, kind of high five as you went 
through the gate.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:40:44 
Getting on post was a lot harder. Everyone took their job a lot 
more seriously. Everyone knew that hey we're fixing to get busy 
and stuff's going to get real. Then it took a little while. It wasn't 
as fast as we thought it would probably ... We kind of stayed 
even keel and really didn't do a whole lot.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:41:15 
It was several months before we actually kicked in and started 
getting just the ... what they call the GWOT money, the Global 
War on Terrorism money started rolling in, more role players, 
more this, more that, more vehicles, more everything. There 
was several rotations after that we would have 300 foreign 
language speakers come in.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:41:42 
We would have ... Okay, good. We would have up to 800 role 
players in the box. Plus we would get three to 400 army 
augmentees down just for more people for rights and what 
have you. We would have well over a 1,000 people in the box 
every day.  
SIMS: 
00:42:04 
Did they ... What was this scenario saying like 2002? I mean was 
it ... I'm assuming it's Afghanistan.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:42:21 
It was, but it wasn't really to the level that it got. We didn't get 
really ... I want to say it was 2004 before we really, really got 
huge. It was bigger. It was more flavored towards the Middle 
East, but it was still not full blown like it got. Like I say, I want to 
say 2000.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:42:50 
I've slipped since then. I want to say 2004 was the first of our 
really ... early 2004 was the first of our really, really, really big 
rotations where the army came to us and said, "This is how 
many we want." We're like, "Good ... You're kidding." You 
know? That's when we started hiring two and 300 people at a 
time.  
SIMS: 
00:43:14 
That's a pretty good amount of time. Why did you think that 
took a while for everything to kick in? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:43:22 
We were meeting the need at the time. We were having two 
and 300 out there. They were giving us more army augmentees, 
so we were giving them everything they wanted. Why it took 
that long to get huge, I don't know, I really don't, but we were 
giving them all the training that they asked for, so that was 
somewhere up in the upper echelon.  
SIMS: 
00:43:56 
Back when they switched from TRW to Cubic, do most of ... Did 
like a whole bunch of brand new people come in or is it... 
HOLCOMB: 
00:44:10 
No, we kept ... This probably isn't proprietary, but the proposals 
are all, or the requests for proposals are all written to where if 
it's not the incumbent wins the contract, the new contractor 
will keep x% of current personnel, not just role players, but 
across the board.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:44:34 
That way the army's not liable for here we have a brand new 
company, now then we're starting this rotation and you've got 
eight zillion people that haven't got a clue of what they're 
doing. So it's mostly the senior leadership changes and a few 
people here and there that maybe were not doing enough to 
maybe lose their job, but weren't really doing a good job either. 
You can just kind of ease them out and get better people in 
there. 
SIMS: 
00:45:11 
During this whole time, you're not employed by the army as a 
civilian. You're employed by TRW ... 
HOLCOMB: 
00:45:18 
Yeah, the contractor, yeah.  
SIMS: 
00:45:20 
Right. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:45:20 
This is the first time I've actually ever had a civil service job. I've 
been a contractor all this time.  
SIMS: 
00:45:33 
Is it a noticeable difference between contractors and/or now 
like as a civilian job, like in terms of when you go to work each 
day, like what's different potentially, if anything? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:45:48 
Contractors there's a lot of different ... It's like we were talking 
about earlier, it's who your program manager is. If you've got a 
great program manager and a great deputy, then it's a great job. 
If you've got a bad one, then like I say, we got a new deputy 
program manager in 2011, and by 2012 I'd been hauled out of 
there with ... They thought I was having a heart attack twice 
from stress, so that's ...  
HOLCOMB: 
00:46:21 
I had had enough. It was simply him. Like I say, I'm hoping CACI 
gets the contract, because I'd love to go back, because I miss 
the people and I miss the job, but it just I was either going to 
have a heart attack ... That guy didn't like me, and I didn't like 
him. He was a ... It was just a bad situation. He accused me of 
everything under the sun. I had had enough.  
SIMS: 
00:46:53 
How often do the contracts change? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:46:57 
The one that Cubic's on right now, they called it a 10-year 
contract, it's actually a one-year contract with nine option 
years, so you've got a year, and if you're not anywhere after 
that one year, you're not doing what the army wants, they can 
... I'm guessing this next one, I don't know if it'll be for that or 
not. I didn't even mess with the full thing. I just messed with the 
role play part.  
SIMS: 
00:47:29 
If you can give me an overall picture of ... It sounds like it gets 
really ... it starts to get big in 2004, 2005. What's the biggest 
point, and then when and why does- 
HOLCOMB: 
00:47:46 
It taper down? 
SIMS: 
00:47:46 
Yeah, it taper down? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:47:47 
Like I say, from 93, when we got here, up until 9/11, it had got 
up to ... stayed around 75 to 100 role players. After 9/11, we got 
up to 200, 300 on some rotations, but they weren't all MREs yet 
either. They were all ... After 2004, early 2004, I want to say 
April, maybe March 2004, everything was an MRE, wham, 
wham, wham, wham, wham. Before that- 
SIMS: 
00:48:19 
I'm sorry what's MRE? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:48:20 
Mission rehearsal exercise, you actual specific, go into a specific 
country. Now before that we had some bigger ones for Bosnia, 
Bosnia and Kosovo. We had rotation for that. That's where we'd 
have two or 300 in there for that, so we had the capability to 
give an MRE, but we had to hire up to make the huge numbers.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:48:47 
I want to say the highest number we had, of actual role players, 
and this was day and night operation, 24-hour ops, total 
number for a day, I want to say it was close to 900 role players, 
300 foreign language speakers, the FLS, the translators. We had 
I want to say between three and 400 army augmentees.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:49:14 
Then we would have some of the O.P.F.O.R. At that time, they 
would come and integrate themselves into the village. They 
would ride out with our people and everything, so they would 
blend in more. Then I'm not sure now, on standard rotation, I'm 
really not sure how many people they're putting in the box now. 
You'd have to ask some of these folks that are current. Actually, 
I see them, but I don't talk shop with ... 
SIMS: 
00:49:42 
It seems a lot less. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:49:45 
Yeah, well Cubic knows that I'm helping another company, so 
they've threatened everyone, "Hey, don't talk," not just to me, 
but, "Don't talk to anybody about what we're doing."  
SIMS: 
00:50:06 
But it's not like the ... what the army would say, like have x 
number of role players, or is this sort of left up to a contractor 
to... 
HOLCOMB: 
00:50:14 
No, you get a ... The army sends out a clear, concise what they 
want every month, so you know. They have the ICB, Initial 
Concept Brief, so that's when the army and the contractor, the 
JRTC, the contractor, usually go to the home station of whatever 
unit's coming here. They sit down and okay, Colonel so and so, 
and do you want to train on? Colonel so and so says this is what 
I want. So JRTC planners, and the Cubic folks, sit down, and they 
come up with a plan.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:50:57 
After that, they have the IPRs. They've have two or three IPRs, 
In Progress Review, so they'll go back, okay this is what we've 
got. The colonel says, "Well I like it, except I don't like this." So 
they'll change this. They'll have two or three of those. Then 
finally when everybody's happy with it, then it's a finished 
product.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:51:21 
You'll get the ... four months out, you'll say, okay, this is what 
we're going to have to have out here. You start planning for if 
it's something outside of what you currently have equipment 
wise or personnel wise, then you have time to react to it. 
There's only been a couple times when we had ... haven't had 
enough time to really ...  
HOLCOMB: 
00:51:44 
We did two away rotations, spur of the moment. We did one in 
Fort Hood, and one in Fort Lewis Washington. We had like 
literally maybe two weeks notice for both of them that we were 
going to move JRTC to ... It got pretty wild for a while. 
SIMS: 
00:52:03 
Yeah, Tommy, I think went on those.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:52:04 
Right. 
SIMS: 
00:52:06 
When, like let's say you go to a colonel in New Jersey, he's going 
to bring his unit here, like is his unit paying for it? I know I'm 
sure it's like...  
HOLCOMB: 
00:52:22 
To a point, the army has set aside x number of dollars. It's JRTC's 
setup for 10 rotations a year. The units that are going ... The 
units know. They'll have a three-year calendar of who's coming 
through JRTC or whatever. So they know x number of months 
out.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:52:47 
They're rehearsing at home. They're training. They know what's 
going to happen at JRTC, so they're doing their rehearsals. The 
money, if it's an MRE, they get extra funds for an MRE. I'm not 
sure if the money is the actual unit's training money or if most 
of the units that come through here are tasked to deploy 
somewhere coming up, if big army pays for it. I'm not sure 
where the ... It's probably a combination of both.  
SIMS: 
00:53:18 
I assume there's a bunch of people that's...that's their job to 
figure all that out? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:53:19 
Yeah, there's a JRTC budget people. We used to laugh about it 
here. The Marines have no money. Everyone knows that. 
Marines have zero dollars. They never have anything. Their 
equipment, they beg, borrow their equipment from whoever. 
But there was a Marine colonel came down a few years back, 
and the story went around that I guess he thought he had all 
the money in the world to play with, because he thought he had 
a big checkbook.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:53:51 
They wrote an ICB. They were talking and talking. He said, 
"Well, I've got a $100,000 to spend. What'll that get me?" The 
JRTC planner said, at the time, said, "Well about three 
documents and a handshake, what more do you want?" So 
yeah, they are budget people. They MIPER the money, which is 
the move all the time. They take it out of this pot, put it in that 
pot. Yeah, there's a lot of bean counting, as we call it, that goes 
on.  
SIMS: 
00:54:27 
How does it work, like big picture, to know? Let's say you're 
here in Michigan, does your unit come every two years for Fort 
Polk, and [inaudible 00:54:39] Fort Polk, and others never go to 
JRTC, [crosstalk 00:54:44]? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:54:43 
If you're a light fighter, like I say, if you're a light unit, this is 
where you come. Every now and then a light unit will go to 
MTC, and every now and then a heavy unit will come here, just 
to mix things up. 101st, 82nd, 10th Mountain, 25th out of 
Hawaii, those were the main units. There used to be four 
brigades.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:55:09 
The army constantly changing, Bush Two increased, supposedly 
33,000 men in the army. All they did was more jobs to 
contractors, take the guys that were already there doing other 
jobs, put them back to doing what they were supposed to be 
doing. But they made a fourth brigade in every infantry unit and 
infantry division, where there used to be only three, so that put 
more units coming through here.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:55:40 
Now then it's back to three brigades again, so 10th Mountain, 
25th, 101st, 82nd, there's four units for sure, with three, that's 
12, so there's 10 rotations a year, so you're not coming through 
every year, but it's fairly ... Then like I say, they'll add units in, a 
heavy unit in every now and then.  
HOLCOMB: 
00:56:00 
They'll add units in, heavy unit in every now and then. 
Historically, in the summer months, either one or two months in 
the summer, the National Guard units now. Each state obviously 
has its own National Guard still, but some of them are oiled 
pigs, some are more equal than others. The Oklahoma National 
Guard, the 45th Separate Infantry Brigade, it's designed to go as 
a brigade to combat. They've come through here fairly every 
three or four years. North Carolina happens to have one, if I'm 
not mistaken and it's North Carolina, Georgia, and somebody 
else I think, make up that brigade. There's four or five National 
Guard units that come through in the summer. They would go 
before other guard units would go. The Louisiana Guard, after 
the crippled women and children's home, will go the Louisiana 
Guard will go. There are a lot of guard units that are designed to 
go before. The Louisiana Guard got a bad black eye during the 
first Gulf War. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:57:23 
They had a brigade that basically didn't want to deploy, so they 
got a bad black eye there. So I don't think the Army's forgiven 
them yet. 
SIMS: 
00:57:34 
They'll have to eventually. So is it somebody in the Pentagon 
who sits there with the calendar? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:57:42 
Oh, yeah. The master guys in the Pentagon G3X, G3 training sat 
down. Third Brigade, 101st, you're going through JRTC rotation 
blah blah next year. So now you know between now and then, 
they'll do twenty exercises on Fort Campbell to get ready to 
come down here.  
SIMS: 
00:58:15 
If you're a role player, or just involved with the training, do you 
notice a difference in terms of from where in the country 
people come from? Obviously they may have different 
specialties in terms of a military mission. But is it different to 
have a New York Unit versus Hawaii? 
HOLCOMB: 
00:58:37 
Not so much. The Hawaii units, they do it to get them 
acclimated. Invariably, Hawaii will come through in the winter, 
and Alaska will come through, the brigade from Alaska that's 
part of the 25th, will come through in the summer. You notice 
them dying out there from the temperature. The guard units 
that come through, you see a difference sometimes in the guard 
units just from the parts of the country. 
SIMS: 
00:59:21 
So they're less consistent in terms. 
HOLCOMB: 
00:59:21 
They're training is generally pretty good, but generally act 
towards things like the units from up in the northeastern part of 
the country, they don't put up with as much BS from the role 
players, the normal daily. They're a little more strict, if you will 
than some of the southern units, which they're sometimes a 
little more laid back. Overall, it's generally cookie cutter. It all 
falls back to the commanders and the NCO. 
SIMS: 
00:59:58 
Right. That makes sense. Can you tell me about some of the 
more interesting things you've seen or heard during the role 
play in terms of the interactions? Tommy was telling me this 
story this morning about a goat named Strawberry. 
HOLCOMB: 
01:00:23 
Yeah, we used to have a scenario. I don't know what the 
politically correct term is nowadays, but the person portrayed, 
we had the crazy lady and the crazy guy. And the crazy lady, she 
would go out there and she would just lose it over anything and 
they had to try to calm her down and try to get a female medic 
to come and help with her. And the crazy guy, he was always 
running around trying to chain himself to a vehicle, trying to 
find a vehicle that was unlocked or whatever, and he'd try to 
steal the vehicle, or he'd take the chain that they secure the 
vehicle with and chain himself to the vehicle. We used to have a 
lot of fun with that. That was always crazy. There used to be in 
the Cortina scenario, we had the Area Coordination Center. The 
ACC, and that's where the governor of the region of Cortina 
portrayed met with the brigade commander. A lot of the 
brigade commanders that have come through here have gone 
to have several stars on their shoulder.  
HOLCOMB: 
01:01:38 
We've had some interesting quotes, we had one the governor, 
told him, you said this, and you said that, and you said you were 
gonna do this? None of it's happened. He said, well governor, 
the truth changes. Over the years, there's been a lot of strange 
and fun things that's happened out there. It was more crazy 
things that happened when we did have the free play. During 
MREs, the mission rehearsal exercises, you're basically scripted 
what you do every day, because they want certain events to 
happen at certain times. If this happens here at this time, it 
affects something that happens over there. You're kind of 
relegated, you don't get the chance to free play. If the unit 
comes in and does something bad, well they don't feel the heat 
like they do in the free play days. 
HOLCOMB: 
01:02:43 
They'll get talked through it at the AAR, but they don't actually 
feel the consequences of a whole village being angry with you at 
one time.  
SIMS: 
01:02:54 
Do you remember anything from the free play that seemed wild 
compared to what they would do today? 
HOLCOMB: 
01:03:01 
A lot of it would be things of that nature. They would come in, 
we're a blue village, we're supposed to be completely pro-
American. They would come into town, and say maybe you had 
an aggressive lieutenant that'd come in and started treating 
people badly. Before long, he finds himself surrounded, the 
crowd has moved around him, he's pushed away from the rest 
of his unit and he's there and he's on the radio frantically trying 
to get somebody to get him. It doesn't take too many times to 
learn a lesson.  
SIMS: 
01:03:56 
Has it become more professional and more scripted? Is there 
anything lost in your opinion, in terms of what the soldiers get 
out of it? 
HOLCOMB: 
01:04:10 
Just from what I've seen since I've worked at range, and part of 
our job is to keep the villages maintained and talking with role 
players. And this has nothing to do with the Army at all. It's an 
internal Cubic thing. Another reason I hope that CACI gets it is 
Cubic kind of puts so many artificial internal constraints, safety 
constraints, all the constraints. The folks go to the village, they 
basically just sit on the porch and wait for something to happen. 
We had people out, they were gardening, they were doing this, 
it looked like a village. I said, this has nothing to do with JRTC, 
it's strictly a contractor problem, is they've made it so hard for 
those people to do their job. Because if you're out there, if you 
wanna run a teller to plant your garden, you've gotta have 
enough PPE on, personal protective equipment, to do battle 
with a dragon or whatever. 
HOLCOMB: 
01:05:21 
You have to have your joint safety assessment, your joint hazard 
assessment. Is the ground uneven? Is the ground this? Safety 
assessment, don't get your fingers in the tiller. And they made it 
so hard to do anything that people just sit on the porch, they 
don't do nothing. To me, it's not what role play is about. Role 
play, you're supposed to be in a village, you're supposed to be 
doing village things, not sitting on the porch. 
SIMS: 
01:05:54 
I hadn't really thought about it, but I guess I did notice over time 
from 05 to last year, not just a number of people, but things 
seem less alive. That's the way I would put it. 
HOLCOMB: 
01:06:08 
Right. I talked to one of the guys out there. It's terrible and it's 
totally a lick on me, but there when it got so big, unless you 
were Superman or the world's biggest dud, I'd recognize your 
face but I may not know your name. Because there was just so 
many people out there. I would see your name when you signed 
your time sheet. But if you did a really great job, after the end 
of rotation, we'd have an award ceremony, I would see you 
then and present you with something. Or if you really messed 
up bad. But if you just came to work and you were a good role 
player and did your job, I never saw it. There was too many 
people. I would try to make it through the village as much as I 
could. But I don't remember the gentleman's name, I'd run into 
him out at Houghton.  
HOLCOMB: 
01:07:06 
He was out there and he had a hoe, and he's raking up the 
garden with a hoe. Which is fine, third world country, they don't 
all have tillers, but I happen to know that role play has tillers. 
And he's out there beating on the hard ground with a hoe, and 
this is an 85 year old man. I'm guessing he's a lot older than I 
am, and he's out there with a hoe and it's hot. And he looks up 
and sees who I am, he shakes my hand, puts his arm around me. 
I said, why aren't you using the tiller? Too much trouble. What 
do you mean? I'd have to wear all of this, I'd have to sign all of 
this, I'd have to have all of this. He said, I'd just rather do it with 
the hoe. I'm thinking, I'd rather have a heart attack than put up 
with the BS. 
HOLCOMB: 
01:07:58 
I don't know CSCI, I've never worked for them a day. They may 
be just as bad, but I'm gonna fight real hard if they get it to not 
have it that way. To make it where it can be a village again. It 
may be a losing battle, I may be out of a job again, but I'm 
gonna fight for it.  
SIMS: 
01:08:16 
Something I noticed in '05, '06, is there were a lot of paintings 
and drawings, which I don't see as much now. 
HOLCOMB: 
01:08:27 
I'm not kidding you a lick when I'm telling you this past year. We 
came off of Christmas leave in January until right around June, 
we worked every weekend in the villages. That's all we did is 
work in the villages. We rebuilt staircases, the decks, all the 
safety things that were wrong. Every rotation, we'd be in a 
different village, and I'd BS with the role players. I would watch 
them. Other than to walk to the latrine, they're sitting on the 
porch, they're sitting inside a building. They're not doing 
anything. Carnis, you drive right through Carnis. You've got a 
market on either side of the road. That's the reason they built 
that market there, where people would be out there trying to 
sell stuff. They'd have the stuff out there, but everybody's in the 
kitchen just sitting there. What training's the unit getting? Just 
driving by, yup there's all that stuff and they keep driving.  
SIMS: 
01:09:41 
So tell me what you know about the paintings. They weren't 
professional but they were better than what I could do. Who 
were the people who made those murals? 
HOLCOMB: 
01:10:02 
We had a bunch of them. We had several women who were 
good, and they would sit out there and they would paint a piece 
of scrap wood or a rock, whatever they would find. We were 
talking earlier about when we had church services. Carnis we 
had a donated organ, and it's still out there. I saw it one of the 
days I was working out there. It's trashed out now, but we had a 
donated organ. On Sunday, we had a lady that could really, 
really play and she was a church organist here in town. They 
would have singings, of course it wouldn't fit for a Muslim 
rotation, but for a Cortina rotation it was great. You could pull 
up and you could hear a church service going. We had a guy 
here, he had actually been the pastor of the biggest church in 
Clarkesville, Tennessee, where Fort Campbell is. 
HOLCOMB: 
01:11:10 
And I'd driven by that church a million times. He ended up here 
because his son was stationed here. I said, we have a church 
here. I said, Bill, we have a church here. He said, no, I don't. I 
said, are you gonna get one? I said I would love to have you give 
our church services on Sunday here. And we were using him as 
an NGO, non-governmental organization guy. He said, well I'm 
not gonna have a church here, but I guess I could do a church 
service out there as long as you realize it's not really my thing. I 
said, Bill, I know the church you pastored at. I've driven by there 
a million times, it was huge. He said, but me and the Lord kind 
of had a falling out. Never questioned him after that, didn't 
want to know. He was the pastor and we had the lady, she 
would be on the organ and we'd have the singing. 
SIMS: 
01:12:10 
Did they go Wednesday night too? 
HOLCOMB: 
01:12:11 
No, they were just Sunday morning, but it was very realistic. 
Every village had a big garden. In the wintertime, we had the 
fire pits. People would be out gathering firewood and stuff like 
that. It was always something, somebody going somewhere out 
of the village doing something. They just didn't go to the village 
and pop a squat and sit. The marketplaces, there'd be women, 
you'd have some crocheting rugs, they'd be painting. We'd get 
them all the supplies they needed to do this stuff. My wife just 
happened to be the Cubic procurement person. I would tell her 
what I needed, especially for MREs, you got extra money for 
stuff like that. They'd knit a rug or whatever and they'd put it in 
the market. You'd just become props at the market to sell. 
SIMS: 
01:13:08 
So would a group of women come to you and say, hey can you 
get us these supplies because we have this idea? And you would 
make a decision, you had the budget to do that kind of thing? 
HOLCOMB: 
01:13:26 
Right, yeah.  
SIMS: 
01:13:29 
But it wasn't kind of like you would go around and say, okay, we 
need this wall painted, we need that wall painted? 
HOLCOMB: 
01:13:41 
That's what kills me to see the villages now, grass is growing up, 
the Hollywood stuff is falling off. The villages look terrible. It 
doesn't look like anyone's lived in them, they just look bad. They 
would come and say, hey can we paint the walls in the such and 
such? Sure, no problem. Hey, can we do this? Can we make 
this? Not a problem. I'd tell Yvonne Polleg was my supply 
person's name. Tell Yvonne what you need, I'll sign it. She'd 
come say, hey they want to get this. I'd sign off on it, Yvonne 
would carry it up the hill to Joe Cleary, our head supply person 
over cubic. He'd initial it, hand it to my wife, my wife would 
order it, we'd get it. It worked well, but I guess they've lost sight 
of the realism out there. 
SIMS: 
01:14:34 
To me, I don't want to make it sound more dramatic than it is, 
but it seems like you had more Hollywood stuff, but there's less 
soul.  
HOLCOMB: 
01:14:50 
Right. That's very true. Even when we first got the Hollywood 
stuff, it was great because it looked good, we wanted it to be 
good. If you go through Carnis when the Hollywood stuff was 
first there, it was a gauntlet going through town, because 
people were selling stuff either side of the road and stepping 
out in front of the vehicle, want you to buy this and that. Now. 
SIMS: 
01:15:18 
It just seems like a dusty old set. 
HOLCOMB: 
01:15:23 
Yeah, exactly. The Army never put any money to the upkeep of 
the Hollywood stuff. So it was a great idea and it worked, but 
now it's kind of a forgotten thing and it's just part of the 
landscape.  
SIMS: 
01:15:42 
Now some villages, it seems like they've been taken down. Why 
is that? 
HOLCOMB: 
01:15:49 
They just got so bad. The villages that we're taking down, the 
main two were Sangari and Sengan. The Sangari outside the 
main wall of what was the old original mount site, it's gone. And 
then Sengan is gone completely. They were all built completely 
Hollywood. There was no original structure in any of it. And a lot 
of it was done on portable buildings that they just put stuff 
around. Say there was never any money in there for the upkeep 
of them. So as time and weather ravages, they basically got 
unsafe. The portable buildings, the floors would just rot out of 
them. The stuff worked great at NTC, that's where they did it 
first and that's one of the things that JRTC and NTC, it's like two 
brothers. If you get this, I gotta have that. If I get it, well you've 
gotta have it. NTC got the Hollywood stuff first. That stuff works 
great in the high desert where there is zero moisture. We get 
more dew in a morning here than they get rainfall in a year 
there. So all the stuff, the seams where it was joined together 
and everything, rainwater got in there. They used very little 
treated material. It was nice, but it was never designed for this 
part of the world.  
SIMS: 
01:17:33 
It was there in '05, '06, and I think it's Sangari, just Shughart 
Gordon, there was a three or four story mosque that was red 
blue and white, built out of shipping containers.  
HOLCOMB: 
01:17:49 
Yup.  
SIMS: 
01:17:54 
Can you tell me the history of that building as you know it? 
When did it go up and did it come down because of the reasons 
that you're talking about? 
HOLCOMB: 
01:18:02 
Yeah. Even the buildings that were shipping container buildings. 
The floors on them were wooden, all they are is mill bands with 
window holes cut in them, then they attach the foam. It looked 
good, it worked really well, the floors rotted out in them, all the 
foam was coming off of them. I'm sure it would've cost a 
fortune, I should say, to try to do the upkeep. If somehow they 
could've started from the beginning as the first little bit started 
happening, there was some preventative maintenance there, 
some of it could've been mitigated. But they all just finally got 
so bad. 
SIMS: 
01:18:52 
Yeah, that one I have to say did seem a little unsafe when I went 
in. 
HOLCOMB: 
01:18:59 
In Jettertown now, there's one down there that's off limits. We 
ask if they want to try to fix it, and it's only a two story one. 
Everything's falling off the sides of it, it was open courtyard 
interior with big thick foam sheets of lattice work, with brick 
work that was inside. It's all falling down, floors are all 
completely rotten.  
SIMS: 
01:19:25 
What's the other name for Jetterburg? 
HOLCOMB: 
01:19:25 
Tufani. 
SIMS: 
01:19:36 
And is that near the Dara Lam, near the airfield?  
HOLCOMB: 
01:19:44 
If you go Dara Lam's on your right, if you turn left, and then 
keep going, the first one you pass through is Jenon, which is 
Huffton, and then the next one you get to is Tefani. That's 
Jettertown.  
SIMS: 
01:19:56 
Okay. 
HOLCOMB: 
01:19:59 
It's in the far southeastern corner of the box. 
SIMS: 
01:20:00 
Okay. We've covered a whole lot. Is there anything you feel like 
you would want people to know that we didn't touch on? 
HOLCOMB: 
01:20:20 
Not that I know of, I just hope I answered your questions. I had 
several people call me, and then my wife saw it on Facebook. 
She sent what you had put on Facebook and she said, hey you 
might want to call this guy. A bunch of role players had already 
called me, and I thought, well I know I'm the only person down 
here that came from Fort Chaffee that was role play. I was there 
twenty years at role play as branch chief, and hope to go back. I 
love the people, I love the job. Just one of them things of life 
came along there. 
SIMS: 
01:21:11 
I understand that. All right. 
[INTERVIEW ENDS 01:21:16]
