I would like to begin with a bit  of an apology.  I am
 
still getting the hang of being retired,  and there are  some
 
parts of it that  I hadn't quite anticipated.  For one thing,
 
I keep on and on being invited to make speeches.
 
Now,  in the old days  I used to give kind of workmanlike
 
talks about how the Folk Arts Program operated at the
 
National Endowment  for the Arts,  where  I was working,  and
 
about what  I thought  could be done within its limitations.
 
But now that  I' m retired,  the sky is the limit,  and I find,  a
 
bit to my dismay,  that  I have only a few things to say,
 
really.  I think that's true of most people;  it takes a long
  
time to get pretty sure about anything.  So as we get older we
 
tend to take our one or two or three little ideas that we' ve
 
spent our lives getting to feel kind of convinced of,  and we
 
dress them up differently every other day and we try to make
 
them look smart and fashionable,  and then here we come again
 
with another speech or another article.  Admittedly,  one model
 
might be  just a bit more useful  for one audience than
 
another,  and you hope you'll guess right,  but after a while
 
you begin to realize you' re  just making that  same old speech
 
and telling that  same three or four good stories.  Well,  how
 
many good stories do most of us know?
 
I need to tell you too that this  is really my first trip
 
to Boone  (
though I' ve known a lot of people -
-
 many of them
 
marvellous artists -
-
 who were born and raised within
 
spitting distance of this very spot) .
 But  I do not claim to
 
be any kind of expert on Appalachia or Appalachian-ness.  i do
 
know,  without ever having met you,  that as a group you are
 
very sensitive and your feelings are easily hurt.  I know this
 
because  I have never yet  spoken in all these years to an
 
audience,  from Seattle to New Orleans,  whose  feelings were
 
not  exquisitely sensitive,  and I have come to believe that
 
this  is not because of my audiences but because of what  I

always talk about -
-
 the crucial  importance of the arts that
 
are traditional to the particular people I find myself among.
 
That's what  I always talk 
1about wherever I go.  And,
 
sadly,  wherever  I go  I find that almost everybody listening
 
has  extremely mixed feelings about their own traditional art
 
forms.  Sometimes they are even downright ashamed of them,
 
almost always a little bit embarrassed by them.  "That old
 
stuff? Art? Nah.  Art  is pure white stone statues,  or it's
 
something Shakespeare  said,  or it's a lady dancing on her
 
toes.  It's not that old by-goner sitting on the back porch
 
playing that screechy old fiddle.
 It's not old lady Whoozis
 
forever making those popcorn bedspreads."
 
You know,  the first time  I ever visited Hawaii,  the nice
 
people  from the arts  council who met me at the airplane told
 
me that they had fixed up tickets for me to go to the
 
Honolulu opera house that evening to hear La Traviata so that
 
I would understand right away that Hawaii had real art,  not
 
just hulas and ukeleles and the most magnificent quilts that
 
anybody in the world ever made.
 
But  still,  everywhere  I go,  I keep on and on talking
 
about the  local art  forms and the home-based artists and why
 
I truly believe they are not only important but essential to
 
the quality of life in that place.  I' m not being sentimental
 
about this.  I' m a tough-minded old lady,  and I believe deeply
 
in what  I am saying.  Let me try to explain what  I mean in
 
more concrete terms,  and I think  I'll  start by talking about
 
how it was  for me when I was a little girl.
 
That was more than seventy years ago  (I was born in
 
1921),  and my family lived in east Texas out  in the
 
countryside.  Where we  lived is now a suburb of Dallas,  but
 
then it was pretty remote,  and so my mother decided to teach
 
me at home.  She taught me Latin and piano and medieval
 
history and lots of unusual things,  but  she also taught me
 
the day-to-day things.  She taught me how to sew,  for example.

of material  from all the clothes mother had made  for us,  and
 
sort of folding doll clothes out of them.
 
But then  I had to learn how to do it right.  My mother
 
was  a great believer in doing things right.  She gave me a
 
Latin motto  (she gave all of us  children different mottos)
 
Mine was  "Faciendo ediscere  facere" which means  "By doing you
 
learn to do" and she would tell me  "By reading you learn to
 
read",  "by dancing you learn to dance",  "
 by sewing you learn
 
to sew".  So I learned how to work her old foot-treadle Singer
 
sewing machine.  She would give me the  front page of the
 
Dallas Morning News after she and father had finished with
 
it,  and -
-
 with the machine unthreaded--  I would sew up and
 
down the newsprint columns and around the photographs until  I
 
learned just how to sew a straight line and turn a neat
 
corner.  And then I had to  learn how to embroider -
-
 because
 
that's what all the little girls did in my part of the
 
country -
-
 at  least  little Anglo girls  like me.
 
Because every November,  my mother and I would go to the
 
dime store downtown and I would get to pick out the presents
 
I was going to make  for Christmas,  secretly,  when nobody was
 
looking.  In those days you could buy dresser scarves or table
 
napkins or bridge table covers that had designs stencilled on
 
them with blue dots.  And embroidering was to cover those blue
 
dots with French knots and lazy daisies and outline stitches
 
in different colors  so that  it would turn out to be a special
 
present that you yourself had a hand in.
 
So after  I had picked out the things  I wanted to
 
embioider for my sister or my mother or my aunts,  I would go
 
to the embroidery thread counter and pick out the colors.
 
That was the best part.  There was always white embroidery
 
thread there,  I remember,  and lots of pastels -
-
 pale green,
 
pink,  lavender,  yellow,  pale blue,  and sometimes black and
 
sometimes  red and sometimes bright green.  I agonized.  I never
 
had enough money for all the colors  I wanted.  One year  I
 
remember coming home with red and black and light green and
 
pink and lavender,  and my older sister  said,  "Honey,  you

don't want to use that  red and black.  They won't blend.  You
 
want  it to blend and be pretty."
 And I thought  it might be
 
pretty,  but  I tried it,  and it wasn't.  It didn't blend,  and I
 
had to pick it all out and start again.
 
Now when  I
 
from my dresses
 
for the others,
 
remember what was  in our ragbag -
-
 scraps
 
and from the shirts and blouses mother made
 
and her own dresses and aprons and good
 
pieces  from father's old business  shirts -
-
 those pieces of
 
cloth weren't  scarlet or magenta or bright green or black.
 
They were  lavender and pink and light blue,  and they were
 
solid colors or small prints.  I guess you could say we were
 
conservative.
 
And every once  in a while my mother would load the
 
ragbag up into the car and we would go to see the quilt  lady
 
who lived about two miles  from us outside of Dallas,  in east
 
Texas.  Now this was during the depression and everybody did
 
what they knew how to do to make a few cents,  and this  lady
 
really did know how to make quilts.  Mother and she would look
 
over all the scraps,  and she would get out all her patterns
 
she had cut out of the newspapers,  and they would decide
 
which pattern would look best with the material we had.  The
 
idea was,  you see,  not to have to buy material;  nobody could
 
afford that  in those days.  But this  lady could take all our
 
old bits and pieces and make absolutely beautiful quilts out
 
of them.  Mother always said she was a real artist at her
 
work.
 
So all the quilts on our beds that we  slept under every
 
night turned out to be blendy.  They were made out of the
 
clothes we wore and the colors we had chosen and the
 
aesthetic principles we had learned -
-
 neat corners,  straight
 
lines,  balanced curves,  precise workmanship,  unemphasized
 
dividing lines,  subtle color gradations.  It's actually a
 
wonderful aesthetic system -
-
 around the world it has
 
produced beautiful effects  from 19th century Italian
 
paintings to British flower gardens to Chinese porcelains to
 
east Texas quilts,

But  although the quilt  lady,  as everybody I knew called
 
her,  was an artist,  according to my mother,  it gradually
 
became clear that  I wasn't.  Sewing just didn't really
 
interest me.  I learned those things that an east Texas Anglo
 
little girl needed to know,  but that was  it.  I didn't become
 
an artist.  On the other hand those aesthetic principles  I
 
learned as a child have never left me.  At home at this moment
 
there is a basket by my chair full of woven squares  I have
 
been putting together for years  for a baby blanket,  and I
 
smile sometimes over them,
 because with the world of color
 
and gaiety to choose  from I have picked out white and pale
 
green and the sweetest pale yellow to make those squares out
 
of,  because  I thought they would just work up so pretty.
 
Now this  is a very homely example,  and I hope that some
 
of you recognize it and understand its understated power.  You
 
see,  nobody told me  I was  learning an aesthetic system;
 
nobody ever thought about  it that way at all -
-
 I was  just
 
learning how to do things the right way.  And you and I have
 
still
 explored what was happening to me fully yet.  Notice,
 
for example,  that although my mother considered it essential
 
for me to learn the principles of sewing,  she did not
 
consider it especially important to show me the rudiments of
 
basketry or of pottery.  Indeed I doubt that  she knew them
 
herself.
 
Now,  what  you do not  learn or experience as a child
 
marks you as distinctively as what you do.  I am sorry to say
 
that as a child I didn't know any Mexican or Black or Indian
 
children who were neighbors to me  in east Texas,  but  I can
 
assure you it  is  likely they would have had instruction in
 
other aesthetic activities as well as  sewing.  A recent
 
research project  in the county of Mount Pleasant,  South
 
Carolina,  where the ancient African basketry tradition
 
connected with rice growing still thrives,  tells us that
 
every single African-American man,  woman and child in that
 
county past the  lap baby stage can make a basket.  They can
 
Notice they all don't,  but they can.  And I can't.  I don't

all night with a bale of straw to weave like the princess in
 
the  fairy tale and you would have to chop my head off the
 
next morning because  I wouldn't have even begun.  Basket
 
making was not part of the artistic tradition in which I was
 
brought up.  Some might even say I was  culturally deprived -
-
even though I could play the piano,  the poor little thing,
 
she  couldn't even make a basket bottom!
 
And then consider the various color palettes that are in
 
use around the world.  American Indians often emphasize
 
primary colors -
-
 blue,  red,  yellow -
-
 each of which can
 
represent a different direction -
-
 east,  north,  south,  we t,
 
up,  down.
 They point a way and make distinctions between
 
elements  rather than shading things together.  African-
American quilters often emphasize movement and energy,  with
 
brilliant  color-soaked contrasts that almost vibrate to the
 
eye:  magenta and lime green and sulphur yellow and lots of
 
black to set  it all off.  The colorful visual playfulness of
 
many Mexican-American traditions depends on the use of
 
shocking pink and scarlet and peacock blues.
 
A few years back in the state of Arizona,  Jim Griffith,
 
the  state  folklorist,  noted that the very hottest,  most
 
creative pinata maker in town had been turning out awfully
 
uncharacteristic pinatas -
-
 all white and baby blue and pale
 
pale pink.  Now,  this artist was  so highly thought of in
 
Tucson that the University of Arizona football team had
 
several times commissioned him to make mammoth pinatas of the
 
Wildcats or the Roadrunners -
-
 whatever their emblem was -
-
and those pinatas had ridden in honor in the victory parades.
 
Jim became  increasingly disturbed by this apparent shift
 
in aesthetic sensibilities of the Mexican-American community,
 
for it turned out that other local pinata makers were also
 
abandoning their usual palettes of electric blue,  scarlet,
 
lime green and shocking pink.  Everybody was going absolutely
 
and uncharacteristically pastel all of a sudden,  and Jim got
 
really curious  as to what  on earth was going on,  what  factors

first things we all think of to do when something
 
unimaginable happens.
 
I understand that the broadcast
 
stations of the nation were flooded with poems written by

had stimulated this really major aesthetic change.  Was  it a
 
kind of art nouveau idea coming up north from Mexico? Was  it
 
some sort of attempt to imitate another possibly more
 
glamorous aesthetic?
 Had the art teachers with their color
 
wheels gotten in there and persuaded the pinata makers to
 
work for gentler,  more mel
ing effects  instead of looking
 
across the color spectrum for brilliance and contrast?
 
The answer turned out to be pretty simple -
-
 awful,  but
 
simple.  The wholesale paper company that  serviced almost all
 
of the state of Arizona had determined
 hat the major tissue
 
papers that were being bought in bulk across the entire  state
 
were light-colored;  department and gift  stores everywhere
 
used white,  pale blue,  or pale pink tissues to wrap their
 
merchandise in,  and they were the big-time quantity
 
consumers.  The  sales of burnt orange,  emerald,  crimson,
 
aquamarine,  royal purple tissue papers were negligible by
 
contrast,  so -
-
 well,  it was a good hard business problem and
 
a good hard business decision got made.  No more bright
 
colored tissue paper;  we can't afford it;  it doesn't make a
 
dime.  Now,  just  for a moment,  let us together look privately
 
into our own silent,  art-loving and profit-loving hearts and
 
think -

 if I were a big-time paper manufacturer in that part
 
of the country,  and times were hard,  what would I do?
 
Well,  what Jim did,  not being a paper manufacturer but a
 
practical man and a first-class  folklorist,  was to stockpile
 
in his own private closet  in his own private  living room a
 
number of industrial-sized rolls of a full range of
 
brilliant,  color-soaked tissue papers.  And any pinata maker
 
in southern Arizona could come by and quietly take off a yard
 
or a mile as needed of any or all of the colors,  according to
 
his own aesthetic taste.  And what do you know -
-
 things  just
 
began to  sort of subside back to normal;  there were fewer and
 
fewer white or pastel pinatas and more and more lively multi-
colored ones,  and pretty soon everybody had forgotten about
 
the great  southern Arizona color change.
 
But what  I learned from it was that our cultural  system
 
is a very powerfully integrated system,  and it tends to work
 
all of a piece,  and what happens here affects what happer
 
there.  And I kept and keep on thinking of how many thousar
.
 
of  similar tiny dramas are being acted out every day in
 
thousands of different  subtly injurious ways  in thousands of
 
American places.  An .I began to believe we must reflect
 
together more frequently and in greater depth on how we might
 
mitigate the massive  forces  in our nation that grind away
 
steadily and often quite unconsciously towards artistic
 
conformity and cultural uniformity.
 
So  far I have been trying to demonstrate what  folk arts
 
are and how they quietly emerge  from the aesthetic patterns
 
expressive of particular folk groups.  (You may not have
 
noticed it,  but that was really what  I was doing.)  And what
 
are  folk groups? They are  simply groups that define
 
themselves as themselves by virtue of sharing one or more
 
common factors -
-
 ethnicity,  occupation,  location,  language,
 
or religion,  perhaps.  (
It's easier sometimes to think about
 
this  if you recall how you might choose to remember a person
 
you  just met -
-
 by virtue of where he  lives,  what  she does,
 
what church he attends or what  language she  speaks.  Most of
 
us belong at one time or another to more than one folk
 
group.)
 
And every person who  is a member of a folk group is
 
exposed to  (or you might  say "learns")  its particular
 
aesthetic pattern and carries  it with him as a point of
 
aesthetic reference for the rest of her life.  This  is why the
 
current emphasis on "multi-culturalism"  in the educational
 
agenda,  as badly defined and confusing as the discussion so
 
often is,  is of  such vital  importance.  Every person,
 
especially every schoolchild,  regardless of the aesthetic
 
system of his or her  family or community,  needs to see that
 
system treated with respect and appreciation and genuine
 
understanding.  When this happens,  individuals can allow
 
themselves to be open to other aesthetic experiences and

become gladdened by variety rather than frightened or
 
angeredor bored.  Each new aesthetic exposure then serves to
 
broaden and deepen our personalities,  making us more wise,
 
more humane,  more subtle.
 
It  is astonishing how deep these early experiences  lie
 
and how potent they are.
 bme years ago I was attending a
 
concert that presented a sampling of the musicians  scheduled
 
to appear at a large multi-ethnic festival in Los Angeles.
 
It was quite a show.  There were  scores of musical
 
performances  from all around the world;  kilted Scots
 
bagpipers marched down the center aisle;  African drummers
 
thundered from the stage,  mariachi orchestras blazed and
 
trumpeted,  gospel choirs  filled the enormous hail with
 
sonorities.  I was  in my element,  making knowledgable remarks
 
to my companions,  (showing off,  frankly),  thrilling to each
 
extraordinary set of sounds.  The whole thing went on for
 
hours,  each performance more special than the last,  until
 
almost at the end three slightly bedraggled looking men
 
carrying a banjo,  a guitar and a string bass  shambled out on
 
the  stage,  fussed around rather unprofessionally for a minute
 
or two and then struck up --"Red Wing".
 
"Red Wing!" The corniest of all  songs,  the one you never
 
know whether you should sing in public or not,  it's text  is
 
so ultimately silly.  But they played "Red Wing",  and my heart
 
absolutely melted.  The most extraordinary sense of total
 
well-being came over me,  I was comforted,  I was secure,  I was
 
home,  that was my song.  And you know what -
-
 I was
 
embarrassed about  it!  I had to admit to myself that  if  I had
 
seen a copy of the program ahead of time,  "Red Wing" would
 
have been the last on my list of possible favorites.  I had
 
moved so far away from my East Texas roots,  I had forgotten
 
where they lay.  But my roots hadn't forgotten.  There they
 
were,  ready to remind me who I am and where  I come from.
 
So that,  ultimately is what this thing called multi-
cultural education and multi-cultural entertainment that  so
 
many people worry over is  really about.  It's about making

sure that everybody on the one hand gets to check back to his
 
own roots every once  in a while  for comfort and dignity and
 
presence and on the other hand gets a chance to revel in the
 
glories of the  inventiveness that other cultures have to
 
share with us.
 
It all reminds me of my dear old friend Dewey Balfa,  the
 
great Cajun fiddler from Lafayette,  Louisiana.  Ever since  I
 
knew him,  when  I asked him what he would most  like to be
 
doing,  he used to say,  "Oh,  what  I really want to do is to
 
teach the children in the  schools how Cajun music works and
 
show them how beautiful it  is".  And then he would tell me all
 
over again how he used to get whippings  for speaking Cajun
 
(which is a dialect of French)  in the  schoolyard when he was
 
a little boy and how he would read in the paper that Cajun
 
music sounded like the yowling of cats.  And his eyes would
 
fill with tears.
 
Many people  from France,  Canada,  and even a few terrible
 
bureaucrats  from the terrible federal government  like Ralph
 
Rinzler and me -
 joined in a major campaign some twenty years
 
ago not  just to have Cajun music presented in the  schools but
 
to have the  language and the arts and the aesthetic system of
 
Cajun culture  included in the base-line materials that Cajun
 
children were given to learn and study in the schools that
 
their Cajun parents were supporting with their Cajun taxes.
 
And after a year or so of this,  one great day when I called
 
Dewey on the long-distance telephone to ask how things were
 
going,  he  said,  "Oh,  it's  just wonderful.  They' re  letting me
 
bring my Cajun band into the music classes right across the
 
state,  and I can show how each instrument plays a rhythm
 
that's different to the others and how the different voices
 
of the instruments  sing high and low,  and the children  just
 
love it and the music teachers  love it  .
 .
 .
 But,  Ms.  Bess,  I
 
have to say I' m beginning to worry about  something."
 
And I said,  "Mr.  Dewey,  what are you worrying about
 
now?" And he said,  "You know,  Ms Bess,  I look at these Cajun
 
children and I think how they oughtn't  just to learn about

Cajun music.  There's  lots of other kinds of music in
 
Louisiana -
-
 there's  Italian music and symphony music and
 
South American music and our Cajun children o ght to have the
 
chance to learn about all of them.  Don't you think so?"
 And
 
I said,  "Yes,  Mr.  Dewey,  you're right.  That's the next thing
 
we have to start to work on."
 
You  see how it works?
 There's a kind of playground
 
justice and sense of order here.  What we have to keep doing
 
is  just  seeing to it that everybody gets their turn and
 
nobody gets much more than their share.  But the pinch comes
 
when we discover that that may mean giving up  just a bit of
 
the prime  
time on the media and in the  schools,  time that  is
 
typically reserved for popular music  (that makes a lot of
 
people a lot of money),  advertising art  (
that does the same),
 
and classical European art  forms  (
that makes most people feel
 
high-toned and properly educated.)  And that  is and will
 
continue to be a really tough battle;  don't ever under-
estimate  it.
 
For,  as  long as  I can remember,  the real problem facing
 
the  folk and traditional arts of all peoples  is what has been
 
called in another context,  the triviality barrier.  It  is
 
truly a stunner.  You see,  no matter how delicate the color
 
palettes,  how refined the weaving techniques,  how imaginative
 
the designs of a Paiute  Indian coiled tray weaver -

notice  I don't  call her a basket-maker -

 her work still
 
carries with it the stigma of being an artistic pursuit that
 
many people feel is  really only appropriate  for small
 
children,  though I doubt any of them ever tried to do it.
 
Indeed "Basket Making 101" has become a synonym for a snap
 
college course  for boneheads.
 
And of course,  "everybody"  knows that nobody paid any
 
real attention to country music until a "real symphony
 
composer"  like Aaron Copland,  came along and wrote that
 
wonderful  "Rodeo" ballet music based on some old banjo tunes
 
he  found in the Archive of American Folk Songs at the Library
 
of Congress.

The triviality barrier is higher and,  I do believe,  even
 
more impervious to attack than the Berlin wall.  At  least,
 
I' ve been scratching away at  it my whole lifetime and I don't
 
see a lot of marks on  it.  But  I can tell you that there's a
 
new and very interesting development -
-
 some young people are
 
beginning intentionally and deliberately to select careers  in
 
the traditional arts over the other options they could
 
perfectly well pursue.  They do not  feel themselves doomed by
 
virtue of birth to practice a traditional art -
 they choose
 
to pursue the arts of their ancestors over a host of other
 
good possibilities.  For example,  in Arizona,  a young Native
 
American graduate music student  I know has decided to explore
 
further the Woodland flute tradition he learned as a boy
 
rather than undertake addditional conventional training in
 
music composition.  Maybe he will return and get his Music Ed
 
degree eventually,  maybe not,  but he had an option to go
 
another way and he chose it.  In South Carolina an African-
American low country basket weaver and mother of three has
 
decided to forgo further graduate classes  in education in
 
order to pursue her weaving career full time.  Examples of her
 
work have been purchased by art museums around the world;  she
 
is an extraordinary artist.  Maybe such decisions  represent
 
not  just a scratch but even a tiny crack in that wall that
 
has  loomed so high for so long.
 
For there are riches to be  found on both sides of the
 
triviality barrier.  I' ve always  liked "Rodeo" and I' ve also
 
delighted in the original  recording by a Virginia banjo
 
picker that Copland drew from in his remarkable score.  In
 
fact,  on the day he came to the Library of Congress to
 
listen,  I helped Mr.Copland find the tunes he eventually
 
used.  And so to me "Rodeo"  is  just another version of "Hop
 
Up,  My Ladies" or "Miss McCloud's Reel" if you prefer to call
 
it that.  -

Let me bring to your attention an essay prirz
ited
 in this
 
month's Harpers Magazine by a professor of arts and
 
humanities at the University of Texas named Frederick Turner.
 
It's titled "The Freedoms of the Past" and he begins with the
 
sentence  "What  is today more boring than the up-to-date?"
 
and goes on later to point out  "the civilizations that have
 
set themselves to imitate the past have always been the most
 
creative and truly innovative ones.  The brilliance of
 
Japanese culture follows  from its devotion to classical
 
Chinese culture,  to the extent that one of its three scripts
 
(kanji)  and two of its three major religious traditions
 
(Buddhism and Confucianism)  were  imported from China.  The
 
European Renaissance was  fired by the ambition to recapture
 
the art and thought of ancient Greece and Rome;  pictorial
 
perspective was discovered by Brunelleschi in 1420 under the
 
mistaken belief that he merely was recovering a lost Roman
 
technique,  and opera was  invented in Florence by Pen ,
 
Caccini and Monteverdi in an attempt to re-create the effects
 
of Greek tragedy.  .
.
 More  recently one can cite the surge of
 
creativity that was released by the Romantic neomedievalists
 
of the nineteenth century,  and the conscious use of classical
 
European models by the writers of the American Renaissaince -
 
-
 Melville,  Hawthorne,  Thoreau,  Emerson,  and even Dickenson
 
and Whitman.. .
 .Our cultural myth is one of liberation,  of the
 
present breaking the shackles of the past.  But what  if it  is
 
the past that breaks the shackles of the present?
 Tradition,
 
Professor Turner says  firmly,  is the realm of true freedom.
 
Well,  poor Professor Turner.  I' m botching up his
 
extremely cogent and yeasty essay when you really should give
 
it a separate read on your own;  it's short but awfully fully
 
packed.  Let's get back to what we all  can do about all this.
