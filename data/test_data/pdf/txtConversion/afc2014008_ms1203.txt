Director
 
Office of Hawaiian Affairs
 
1600 Kapiolani Boulevard,  #1500
 
Honolulu,  HI

Dear Kamaki:
 
I very much enjoyed seeing you in your new surroundings.
 You
 
have an enormous job, and we wish you good fortune in the period
 
ahead.
 Needless to say, we would be happy to talk with you as
 
your plans become more clear.
 I would be happy to see you when
 
you are in Washington and when our respective schedules can gibe
 
Your call to Eni Hunkin had an extraordinary effect.
 Eni could
 
not have been more attentive.
 He was also a most interesting
 
person to get to know in American Samoa.
 He thinks the world of
 
you.
 There should be more exchange between Hawaii and the
 
Territories.
 
Well,  Kamaki,  it seems to me that the Office of Hawaiian Affairs
 
provides a place in which your talents can thrive.
 I
t was thus
 
a great pleasure to see you in your new position.
 
Best regards.
 
Sincerely,
 
.

Belatedly,  this is to thank you for hosting a breakfast with
 
your deans and the faculty during my visit to Hawaii.
 I
 
sympathize with your most particular problems with your
 
legislature, and I enjoyed getting the chance to talk with you.
 
You have a fine faculty in the arts areas;  it was most
 
informative for me to become aware of their activities and
 
concerns.

Dear George:
 
Belatedly,  this is to thank you for the very pleasant lunch and
 
tour of your Academy.
 I was most impressed.
 You have a very
 
fine museum indeed,  and we at the Endowment look forward to
 
helping you where we can in the years ahead.
 I particularly
 
wish you good fortune in the restoration of the new building
 
which you so urgently need.
 
I was also most impressed,  George, by your own personal sense of
 
direction for the Academy.
 It seems to me you have both the
 
v
ision and the practical "smarts" to make progress towards it.
 
The Academy is lucky to have you as its Director.
 
Best regards.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Henry:
 
This is just a brief note to let you know how much I enjoyed
 
meeting you during my visit to Hawaii.
 Your dedication to all
 
of the arts in Hawaii was evidenced by your repeated "showing
 
up" at all those Hodsoll events.
 That took stamina
 
On a serious note,  I want you to know that I think the Academy
 
is a very fine institution indeed.
 In addition to its historic
 
excellence,  it clearly benefits today from your and George
 
Ellis'  leadership.
 We at the Endowment will do what we can to
 
help.
 I would also like to add to your own conviction that
 
George Ellis is a very fine Director of the Academy.
 You are
 
lucky to have him.
 
I hope our paths cross again.
 
Best regards.
 
Sincerely,
