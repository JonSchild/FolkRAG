TIRED OF SINGLE LIFE. 
Copyright Secured 1880. 
Written expressly for and sung with great success by Muss Lon= 
GRANT. 
You see before you a 
nice young girl, 
Whose heart is nearly breaking; 
Who wants a 
bean to love her so, 
All other girls forsaking. 
Now do me take, for goodness sake, 
You'll never find another 
Who'll be more true than I 
to you, 
If you'll take me from my mother. 
CHORUS. 
tired of single life, 
It's misery and strife; 
I'm looking for a 
nice young man, 
To be his little wife. 
To marry is my plan, 
So take me while you can, 
Don't sit there and at me stare, 
But speak out like a 
man. 
Now there's a 
young man sitting there, 
You see he's at me -winking, 
Oh, yes you were, for I 
could see 
Your eyes they were a 
blinking. 
Now, kind sir, don't angry. get, 
At my bold advances; 
We'll married be to-morrow if 
You'll only take the chances. 
I'm tired of single lifei etc. 
REMEMBER THE POOR. 
Sung with great success by LOTTIE GRANT. 
Now winter has come with his cold, chilly breath, 
And the verdure has dropped from the trees; 
All nature seems touched with the finger of death, 
And the streams are beginning to freeze. 
When wanton young lads o'er the river can slide, 
And Florin, attends us no more; 
When in plenty you sit by a 
good fireside, 
Sure you ought to remember the pcor. 
When the cold feathered snow does in plentv descend, 
And whiten the prospects around: 
When the keen cutting wind from the north .
511[01 '
at-
tend. 
Hard, chilling and freezing the ground. 
When the hills and the dales are all covered 
white. 
When the rivers congeal to the shore; 
When the bright twinkling stars shall proclaim a 
cold 
night, 
Then remember the state of the poor. 
When the poor, harmless hare may be traced to the 
woods, 
By her footsteps indented in snow; 
When the lips and the fingers are standing in blood, 
When the marksman a 
game-shooting go. 
When the poor robin redbreast approaches the cot, 
When the icicles hag at the door; 
When the bowl smokes with something reviving and 
hot, 
That's the time to remember the poor 
Soon the day will be here when a 
SaviorXdigibOin; 
All the world shall agree as one race 
All nations unite to salute the blest morn, 
All ends of the earth shall rejoice. 
Grim death is deprived of his all-killing sting, 
And the grave is triumphant no more ; 
saints, angels and men hallelujah shall sing, 
And the rich shall remember the poor,

Ladies and gentlemen, how do you do, how do you 
do, 
I've a 
few little pictures to sell unto you, unto you, 
Some heroes, some gentlemen, noble and fine, 
I 
will show you their photographs one at a 
time, 
And a 
choice from among them I'm sure you will buy, 
To sell you them all I 
am going to try. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
The first is a 
man whom every one knows, will you 
buy? 
A 
friend to the laboring man staunch and true, will 
you buy? 
But a 
murderer's shot sent him far from this shore, 
His beneficient hand we shall never grasp more; 
(raises picture) 
Colonel Jim Fisk, to sell him I'll try, 
Here is the picture, come now, will you buy? 
The next is a 
man of a 
great nation's choice, will you 
buy? 
Who ended the war and made millions rejoice, will 
you buy? 
He drew his sabre in freedom's great cause, 
He's the magistrate now who o'ersees our laws, 
General Grant, a 
nature's nobleman bold, 
Come buy this nice picture, it soon must be solc14 
PLEASE BUY MY PICTURES.. 
(Concluded.) 
The last is a 
name we shall ever revere, will you buy? 
I 
mention his name to memory dear, will you buy? 
Virginia's hero, CoMinh:Ws son, 
He was first in the hearts of his own countrymen, 
General George Washington, now will you buy? 
To sell you this picture I'm going to try. 
(Do not repeat these last two lines, but let the orchestra 
play " Star Spangled Banner" for the artist's exit.) 
The next is a 
patriot warrior so kind, will you buy? 
Who was honored and loved for his generous mind, 
will you buy? 
He was noble" and kind, he was honest and brave, 
And a 
nation's tears moisten the grass o'er his grave; 
Robert E. Lee, noble, great, good, and true 
Here is the picture, come buy it, now do. 
Now here is a 
hero with heart true as- steel, will you 
buy? 
Who never was known to go back or to yield, will 
you buy? 
He was true to the core, he was staunch to his trust, 
He was upright and noble, right, honest and just, 
Brave Stonewall Jackson, come now, will you buy, 
To sell you this picture I'm going to try.

BEN'S ELECTRIC LIGHT.* 
Written by Wm.:WATrs, expressly for Lox= GROS 
You've heard of the electric light, which upon us 
soon will shine, 
But what I 
now will sing to you does knock it out of 
time; 
The dollar of our daddies which John Sherman lately 
wrought, 
You will find it worth but eighty cents—the balance 
it is short. 
We have got specie payment now, but gold we never 
see, 
And Grant is corning back to us, he's done his little 
spree; 
He learned the can can while in France, winked at a 
girl one night, 
Till Mrs. Grant with passion pat out his electric light. 
CHORUS. 
Each king did give him welcome, 
With Queen Vic got jolly tight; 
Courted all the Sultan's beauties, 
Did this great electric light. 
Old Beecher goes to Canada! his great regiment to 
please, 
But that's too thin, he goes to win the sweet Princess 
Louise; 
Friend Talmage is on trial and I'm sure you won't 
him blame, 
If his brother parsons he does beat, and play out 
" 
common fame."

BEN'S ELECTRIC LIGHT. 
(Concluded.) 
Ben Butler's near the witness box, the widows there 
to cheat, 
Who tickle up our senators, these darlings on the 
beat; 
Old Simon Cameron he saved, with his one eye so 
bright, 
He bulldozed all the widows with that one electric 
light. 
CHORTTS. 
When Ben one eye goes on them, 
They do back out with affright; 
There is no chance for grass widow 
Beneath Ben's electric light. 
The darkies all to Kansas go, poor John Bull IS 
in the 
hole, 
Since Lorillard to England sent his great race horse 
" 
Parole ;" 
Each girl is gone on walking, we can't keep them off 
the track, 
And plucky Ennis he has swore the belt he will bring 
back. 
They preach against the actors all, but in the Lone 
Star State, 
A 
gallant man they shot him down when Porter met, 
his fate; 
None like those actors whom I 
sing, so free did givf 
his mite, 
Their deeds more bright do glitter than the new elec-
tric light. 
CHORUS-
; 
Then blame no more the actors, 
In such things they take delight, 
For their kindness shines more clearer 
Wiltan the new electric light.

MEDLEY FLAG SONG. 
HE NEVER MISSED A MEAL. 
Composed and arranged expressly for Lamm GRaz.r. 
Fyn just come to call your attention, 
To a 
few words that I 
have to say. 
Some facts I 
am geing to mention, 
I 
happened to think of to-day. 
I 
thought of our glorious banner. 
The beautiful red, white and blue, 
And so wrote a 
song about emblems, 
And come here to sing it to you. 
It s 
a 
song about the different flags of nations, 
'That heroes have fought for and have won; 
And the first one I 
will show you is old England's, 
it was fought for by the Duke of Wellington. 
(Shows English flag.) 
Oh. I've a 
glorious emblem here 
That all of you know well, 
And many a 
hero for its sake 
On the battle field has fell: 
The Shamrock round the Harp entwined 
In beauty here is seen. 
And every Irish heart will love 
Old Erin's flag of green. 
(Shows Irish flag.) 
The Germans are famous for drinking their beer, 
For music and painting, lots of good cheer, 
And most of you know the flag I 
have here. 
The flag of our own Dietcherland. 
'Tis true a 
republic has no use for kings, 
With songs of our freedom our universe rings, 
While every good ship now emigrants brings 
Far away from our own Faderland. 
(Shows German flag.) 
There's a 
flag known throughout this great nation, 
And it's worshipped wherever it flies. 
It's the pride and the boast of our country, 
It's a 
nation that never will die. 
It is formed of the stars up in Heaven. 
And the stripes of the glorious emblems here; 
It's the pride and the boast of our country, I 
It's the glorious red, white and blue. 
Three cheers for the red, white and blue. 
Three cheers for the red, white and blue; 
It's the pride and the boast of our country, 
It's the glorious red, white and blue. 
(Shows American flag.)

Of would-be-high-toned style; 
You can find me in my seat at twelve,

You should see me make a 
leap 
Prom off the stool I'm sitting on, 
And swallow up the meat. 
When my mother turns her back to me, 
The plum duff I 
then steal, 
For the old man swears he'll throw me out, 
But then I 
never miss a 
meal. 
I'm always in my seat, etc. 
Now all you bummers do like me, 
Don't let your lips hang down, 
And don't go too far away 
To hear the dinner sound. 
Should the old man make a 
bluff at you., 
Be as slippery as an eel, 
Tell him, old man, you'll never stand 
To miss a 
good square meal. 
I'm always in my seat, etc.

Sung with great success by Loran GRA:iT. 
SOME ladies love the sailor bold, 
Who plows the angry ocean; 
While others love the heavy swell. 
While I 
still love the grand. 
Some ladies do not love at all, 
- But my heart's in a 
commotion, 
I 
love to see the darling fellows 
Marching with the band. 
CHORUS. 
As they march along so grand, 
Is there one girl in this land, 
Who to her gallant soldier, 
Would not give their heart and hand. 
With pleasure and with pride, 
I'll be a 
soldier's bride, 
I 
love to see those darling fellows 
Marching with the band, 
He's joinel the ranks with martial air, 
As you can plainly see, 
And when he does prove colonel, 
How happy I 
will be. 
At small sword exercise he's great, 
But then I 
say he's grand. 
I

Marching with the band.

I'm leaving now the old folks, to go I

I'm leaving them in sorrow, grief, and care, 
They're poor and almost helpless, 
They're old and feeble, too, 
So I

My mother's heart will nearly break, 
When I

And father lie will bow his head 
And say " I'm left aleee;" 
God knows I

But what am I

I

STYLES OF . 
THE DAY. 
Copyright Secured 1880. 
Written by JACK Erwax, Respectfully dedicated to JAS. M. 
MURPHY. 
I 
know you would all like to hear something sweet, 
Well now, I'll describe all the styles that I 
meet; 
The first on the list is the ladies " Chapeau," 
A hat I 
am towld that is now all the go. 
It's a 
round little di-doe just two fingers tall, 
With a 
bandage of ribbon called spotted Bengal; 
On the side there's a 
cuckoo, who if looked at would 
say: 
Cuckoo—ta-ta, it's the style of the day. 
Cnonts. 
Oh, the daisies and darlings you meet on the street, 
I'll sit down and swear they're to 'tony to eat; 
Believe me, dear friends. I 
mean all what I 
say, 
Sure they'd rather waltz out with the styles of the 
day. 
Cleopatra my daughter, wears a 
dress called a "Kilt," 
Which looks to me like an old box plaited quilt; 
She has a 
strap and a 
bag which is tied to her side, 
And her hair tied in platters just two inches wide. 
On her heels she has clappers, made of pig iron brass, 
So the Charleys can hear her whenever they pass; 
When at home I 
make game of her, to me she will say: 
Never mind, Hercules, its the style of the day. 
Oh, the daisies, etc. 
Now the style of the gents are quite funny to me, 
And I 
can't help but laugh at some chaos that I 
sea; 
They have a 
new coat called the ' Revarsabill," 
Which is cut with a 
hammer, and it's made of Chin-
Chill. 
The wear a 
new collar called the Rassie and Fail, 
And when it gets dirty, just rub it, that's all, 
My son he wears samples he gets on T3roady.ety, 
Where of course you will see all the styles nf the day. 
Oh, the da6ies, etc.

She was fairer than the fairest, 
Ever faithful, fond and true, 
And she wore beneath a 
bonnet 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
Ere the summer days departed, 
We had made a 
solemn vow, 
And I 
never, never wearied 
Kissing her sweet cheek and brow; 
She was dearer than the clearest, 
Pure as drops of morning dew, 
And adown her neck was hanging, 
amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fairer, etc. 
'Was decreed that fate should part us 
Ere the leaves of autumn fell, 
And two loving hearts were severed 
That had loved each other well; 
She was all I 
had to cherish, 
She has bade a 
last adieu, 
And I 
see in ev'ry vision 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fairer, etc.

AN AWFITL TATA,* 
Written for the N. Y. Clipper. 
Solomon Briggs a 
fisherman wail 
Who sailed the ocean blue; 
He owned a 
schooner-rigger midway', 
And was captain, cook and crew. 
He scoured the " wet " for mackerel, 
Cod, sculpin and. lamper-eels--
Porgies on toast and whiskey straight 
Served for his daily meals. 
He had a 
wife and four young Briggs 
Whom he left at their Cape Cod home, 
To live on clams and pork and beans, 
While he wandered o'er the foam. 
A 
run on the banks he'd often take 
In his schooner the " Sally Glue," 
And he'd sail away nor'east-by-nor', 
Till land was lost to view. 
One day, when off the bluenose coast, 
Away on his starboard bow, 
He spied what seemed to be a 
wreck, 
With the water o'er the prow; 
He took his whiskey glass aloft 
And viewed the vessel's deck, 
Then quickly changed his schooner's course 
To overhaul the wreck.

Oh, would that I 
were sleeping, there, 
Beside my love, in Greenwood fair ! 
I 
know that he would turn once more, 
To bless and kiss me, as of yore. 
Yes, the birds will sing in the happy spring. 
In spite of sadness that grief doth bring ; 
The hurrying throng will pass heedless by 
Without a 
tear or e'en a

.For me no more the world is bright, 
The sun seems shorn of its radiant ihrh; 
My heart was torn from my aching bre.4A,

Look at us well now, do we look green ? 
We have an eye that would capture a

With our handsome figure we make their heads swim, 
And with our Dundreary cut, neat and trim.

A. LEAN banana, decayed to the core, 
E'er since I 
slipped on thy peel I've been so sore, 
On my back I 
lingered just where I 
fell, 
The sweet words I 
uttered would ne'er do to tell, 
If I 
could have caught then the dizzy looking gawk, 
Who threw thit banana peel out on the walk, 
It made me see stars that I 
ne'er saw before,

lean banana

Lightly I'll tread on the sidewalk evermore, 
A. lean banana rotten to the core, 
I 
slipped on thy peel, I'll be careful evermore, 
A

A 
lean banana you've caused many a 
roar, 
I 
slipped on thy ped and you turned me o'c r 
and o'er, 
And young girls have blushed so when thrown off their 
pegs, 
S!ipping on a 
banana and showing their denr legs, 
Numerous are the pedestrains that you have caused to 
fall, 
Great big and little, lean, lank and tall, 
The seats of fat men's pants you've busted and you've 
tore, 
A ken banana, how they have swore.

Watchful I 
am from the time I 
leave my door,

As the merry birds that warble in the trees, 
Or the wild flowers that scent the summer breeze, 
As I 
wander here rind there, without a 
thought of care, 
My hsvpiness does every hour increase. 
How sweet to love and be loved in return, 
When modest maiden cheeks begin to burn, 
And eyes of diamond light outshine the glare at night 
To wake from blissful dreams at early dawn. 
Oh dear ! the tender passion love, 
How beautiful bewildering you seem 
Like a 
boon descending from above, 
Elisium the rapture of a 
dream. 
Oh! blight and merry pass the hours away, 
And time but makes the moments glad and gay, 
As I 
wonder through the grove to sing of her I 
lova. 
And like the birds I 
carrol forth my lay.

Beautiful pink and white roses,

BOSTON FIRE. 
As sung by Wrrietim SCANLAN. 
Air :— Pat Won't Go Home till Morning 
L. was only on the Tenth of last November, 
That we heard the news we ever shall remember, 
That the fire-king had cast its burning embers 
O'er another fated city in our land. 
As the woeful tidings flashed along the wire, 
Of this other sad catastrophe so dire, 
That Boston, beauteous city was on fire, 
And sinking 'neath the fiend's relentless hand. 
Fire! fire! was heard the cry, 
In every breeze that passed us by, 
All the world did heave a 
sigh of pity; 
Strong men in anguish pray'd. 
Fervent prayers to Heaven to aid, 
Before the fire in ruins laid, 
'?air Boston, beauteous city. 
Aad all through the terrible commotion, 
The wind blew a 
gale from off the ocean, 
The brave firemen worked with all devotion, 
To laugh at their efforts yet it 139e1P'cli

And soared with fiery prayer still higher. 
O'er chimney top, steeple and church spire, 
Till all was one vast flame of fire, 
And the light around the horizon gleamed.

But who saved the city from a 
panic, 
From the rule of the fire king too tyranic, 
But the brave-hearted fireman and mechanic. 
The best and the noblest in the land; 
Far brighter than the soldier's record of glory, 
Are the names of those who live in song and story, 
Who'll rebuild the city to its former glory, 
And build her up, if possible, more grand. 
CHORUS. 
And soon will no trace remain, 
Of that vast sea of flame, 
Beston will rise again, remember; 
Brave men will be found, 
Who will build a 
fairer town, 
Like Chicago, from the ground, 
Before the next November. 
THE BROOKLYN FIRE. 
Written by Tim ML`RRAYS, ED. and ALICE, and sung by GEO. Muitztey 
Oh I 
sad and dismal is the tale 
I 
will relate to you : 
'Tis of the Brooklyn Fire, and 
The souls that perished, too. 
You all ,lave heard their awful fate, 
The old, no young, and gay ; 
That ill-starved band, by Heaven's command, 
Are dead and passed away. 
They le', their homes so gay and free, 
With joy on every lip. 
and in their blithest 'moment, ah, 
There came that fatal slip, 
the demon fire raged around, 
Not one to cheek its sway ; 
11 fear and strife once full of life, 
Are dead and passed away. 
But blame to none, it was Heaven's shaft 
That struck that Liappy throng ; 
The king of terrors wakened where 
He slept so deep and long. 
The poor souls in the gallery, who 
Enjoyed that fatal play. 
They little thought their lives were sought 
They are dead and passed away. 
There are sorrr4 el those departed ones 
Are w‘Al iinown to you all : 
Harry Iturlock and his partner 
Met death within those halls, 
In years to come we'll not forget, 
Though feeble, old, and gray, 
Their souls bereft they would have left, 
They are dead and passed away.

Sung by J
OHN D. Gummi'. 
O, ladies and gentlemen listen to nie, 
And whip you have heard me I'm sure you'll agree 
That I'm much abused, though I 
can't tell why, 
And to tell you my troubles I'm going to try. 
On the corner beyond there's gang of young roughs. 
They insult decent people and call themselves toughs, 
And ivwy day at me their slang they do toss, 
And they say I 
resemble the lost Charley R093. 
They always do give me their slang and abuse, 
They cry out " Gilhooly, your collar is loose," 
At Mulligan's wake sure they filled me with snuff, 
And told me to go out and get meself stuffed. 
Snre, one of thim said, if I 
wanted a 
job, 
To go to the river and shovel off fog! 
But to understand thim I'm greatly at loss, 
Whin they say, " Pipe him off—there goes young 
Charley Ross!" 
'Twas only last night sure, they gave me a 
call, 
To deliver a 
lecture at Hibernia Hall, 
I 
put on a 
biled shirt and hasten'd there quick, 
INt the blackguards did serve me the divil's own 
trick, 
Whin I 
what in they put a 
big bag on my head, 
And rolled me around 'till I 
thcught I 
was dead; 
Then they threw me down stairs with a 
terrible toss, 
A.nd tould the police they had found Charley Ross.

Singing as we go out to the field, 
Picking cotton, or else forgotton, 
Except to see how much de ground do yield.

The theatre was fu'l—ir was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny! why he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Run down yhur face like rain; 
And every time he came on the stage, 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A 
family ? yes, he'd a 
family, 
An he loved them as dear as his life; 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife, 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot, 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one night, and I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise ; 
For they would laugh ' till their sides would ache 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began—each_neck was stretched forth, 
And eakerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi I

For Dorkins to make his first entrance and then

DORKINS' 
NIGHT. 
Continued. 
At last he appeared, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see : 
Why, Dorkins is playing quite badly to-night I 
The people said sitting ' round me. 
A 
hiss! yes, it was ; I 
saw Dorkins start, 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang ; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all ' round, 
While his head on his breast he would hang. 
He's drunk! someone said, and I 
thought so myself, 
For to Ire it was awful at times, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said— 
" 
If I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The fault's not the heart, but the head. 
There's many a 
night l've made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well stand ; 
And every effort was plain to me then, 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to- night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came 
sob and a 
moan; 
" 
I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh-

Words by 31ORCLIN. 
Music by J. R. ThomAB. 
As sung by JENNzr. Mono.k.N. 
Music to be had of OLIVER DrrsoN & Co., Poston, Mass., Price oats. 
You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me; 
But, ah! There comes another day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked with thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle power 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ali! no, 1 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me, 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not :Fret me; 
Ali! no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me,.

Just give me your attention and I

A 
ballad new and beautiful—they call it " Nancy Lee." 
It was written in 1812, and copied with a 
feather, 
And the composer dies a 
horrible death for saying " Hardly Ever." 
To his grave goes little Buttertub, her mutton feet she drags, 
And drops her anchor on the grass to study up old gags; 
When at last the lightning strikes her, and puts her into motion, 
Then she rises up with " Baby Mine," and sails across the ocean. 
Cnortusi. 
Brittertub and Josephine have doubled up together, 
Singing " Daisy Dean" and " Lottie Lee" and sometimes "Hard-
ly Ever;' 
Rise, Butter, rise, for you are as strong as ever, 
With Josephine of the horse-marine, and sometimes " Hardly 
Ever." 
On walking down Main street, one sunny afternoon, 
I 
saw the daisy Josephine a-clearing the spittoon, 
And as I 
passed her by her face to me she there did raise, 
In the key of X 
she loudly bawled, " Seldom, hardly always." 
When along came Mr. Crosseye, and she threw him in a 
ditch, 
To Join bold Captain Corcoran, the maiden and the pitch; 
Then comes his cousins and his aunts, all armed with baseball bats; 
From the window stuck Sir Joseph's head. crying " Heavens, ' tis the 
cats." 
Buttertub and Josephine, etc. 
Twelve years ago. Crosseye was sick from eating bulwark stew— 
He raised the gallant topsail, and heaved up the anchor too, 
When Sir Joseph was a 
cabin-boy and polished up the brass, 
And Rackstraw with a 
ran " tin-spike the captain's daughter mashed. 
While sailing o'er the sea one day the ship she strnek a 
rock. 
And all bands were called up on deck to sing " Grandfather's Clock." 
Mow, if yon want to leave this world, get all your aunts together, 
Walk out some day among the gang, and cry out Hardly ever."

drame; 
She is thoroughly ccn -
rersant with the art of etiquette, 
And at cards she'd beat old Hoyle himself a 
game. 
Oh, she'd play you whist or cribbage, forty-fives or 
casino, 
And she'll dale the cards just like a 
gamblin? man, 
poker or peaknuckle, or Sanky oh Pedro. 
Such an education has my Mary Ann. 
She's a 
darling. eta 
My Mary Ann's a 
dancer in the art of terpsichore, 
You should see her forward four and alamandi; 
She'd break up all the lumber that you'd put down or 
the floor, 
Such a 
heavy stepper is my Mary Ann. 
Oh, she'd dance you the mazourka, a 
polka or quadrille, 
Reel or jig or shuffle in the sand, schottishe or the Ger. 
man yo .. couldn't keep her still, 
SuCh an education has my Mary Ann. 
She's a 
darling, etc.

SUMMER groves may lose their gladness; 
Wint'ry winds may wander by, 
Cares may come and weary sadness, 
Must we then forever sigh? 
Brave the storm with firm endeavor, 
Let your vin repinings go ! 
Hopeful hearts will find forever— 
Roses underneath the snow. 
CHORUS. 
Brave the storm with endeavor, 
Let your vain repinings go ! 
Hopeful hearts will find forever— 
Roses undeaneath the snow. 
One by one the links that bind us, 
May be severed here on earth ; 
But the Sun will surely find us 
Thro' the Winter's gloomy dearth! 
Cheerful hearts around us beating, 
Wearing ever Summer's glow 
Ah! we know you're always meeting— 
Roses underneath the snow. 
Brave th: storm, del 
Never joy that earth can send us 
Can torever leave us here! 
Ev'ry flower that Spring can lend us 
Blooms again another year! 
Cares may come, but never mind them, 
Joys may come and joys may go 
e. 
Look around and ycu will find them— 
Roses underneath the snow. 
Brave the storm, etc.

A 
COMPLETE AMATEUR'S GUIDE. 
This volume has been compiled with the greatest 
care, and is considered by far the most complete 
and comprehensive work on skating that has, up to 
the present day, been put before the public. 
The 
practical details relating to skating in all its branches 
are minutely given; the beginner is progressively 
led from the simplest elements to the most difficult 
combinations. 
Especial attention has been paid to 
the proper position of the body and its parts, for 
the execution of movements with grace, the greatest 
care has been taken to describe the figures perfectly 
and clearly, and many cuts are added to ' illustrate 
the subjects. 
This is the only authorized book on this subject 
that is used by the leading noted skating profes-
sionals, and by all the leading dealers in skaters' 
outfits.

Introduced so elegant and entertaining as the " BERLIN PERFORA-
TED-BOARD PATTERNS" now offered to the public. Among the 
points to reccommend these patterns to favorable attention are that

the recreation which they afford with a 
pleasureeble tasking of the 
imagination and ingenuity of the embroiderer. Through them the 
worker can enjoy the pleasureable pride of seeing her home embel-
lished by " things of beauty "—the product of her own hands, or of 
(blighting her friends by presents which, however me- ensive, are 
.4 delicate and acceptable. 
Tho designs are ingenius and correct, and 
the pieces when embroidered and cut, fit to a 
charm. The colors are 
brilliant and artistically contrasted.

suggestive as innumerable variations will occur to the fancy in the 
course of working-, 
and thus every taste can be suited.
