The Rhetorical Feminine  
 
 
Gliding from the confluence of Battery Rock  
to the Devil’s Backbone inside the Shawnee  
 
National Forest makes a sound I cannot  
duplicate in English. With one finger tracing  
 
the route on an atlas, my tongue wet  
with nostalgia—a waterlogged migration  
 
by touch. I seek the cities without the words.  
As late somebody’s 1810 there were headwater  
 
communities of women for the express purpose of healing,  
birthing, governing shared territory—crouched  
 
in the frog-legged stance of delivery and defense. 
Linguistic evidence suggests a pattern of feminization  
 
in Shawnee rhetoric. Nation of women,  
bellowed strangers even as river city  
 
dialects mouthed spells that cured war like hides  
and curved breech births veiled in water 
 
to the banks of living territory. Gliding from the confluence  
of Battery Rock to the Devil’s Backbone  
 
inside the Shawnee National Forest  
makes a sound I cannot duplicate in English.
