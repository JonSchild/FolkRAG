Little Sweetheart come and kiss me. 
As sung by D. S. WAAIBOLD. 
Little sweetheart come and kiss me 
Just once more before I 
go; 
Tell me truly will you miss me, 
As I 
wander too and fro ? 
Let me feel the tender pressing 
Of your ruby lips to mine 
With your dimpled hands compressing, 
And your snowy arms entwine. 
CHORUS. 
Ah! Little sweetheart come and kiss me 
Come and whisper soft and low; 
That your heart will sadly miss me, 
As I 
wander too and fro. 
Little sweetheart come and kiss me, 
We may never meet again! 
We may never roam together 
Down the dear old. shady lane, 
Future years may bring us sorrow, 
That our hearts but _ little know, 
Still of care we should not borrow; 
Come and kiss me ere I 
go.

As sung by the great RICARDO. 
I 
know a 
maiden fair to see 
Take care! take care! take care! take care! 
She can both false and friendly be 
Beware! beware! beware! 
She is fooling thee, 
Trust her not, Oh trust her not. 
She has two eyes so soft and brown 
Take care! take care! beware! beware! 
She gives a 
side glance and looks down 
Trust her not, oh! trust her not. 
Oh bewarei! beware! beware 
She is fooling thee, 
Trust her not, oh! trust her not. 
And she has hair of golden hue 
And what she says it is not true 
Beware! beware 
For she has hair of a 
golden hue 
Oh trust her not! 
And what she says it is not true, 
She gives thee a 
garland fair 
'Tis a 
fools cap for thee to wear, 
Oh! she's fooling thee 
Trust her not, oh! trust her not. 
RING THE BELL SOFTLY. 
As sung by BEAUMONT READ. 
Some one has gone from this strange world of ours, 
No more to gather its thorns with its flowers; 
No more to linger where sunbeams must fade, 
Where, on all beauty, death's fingers are laid; 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet, 
Some one has gone to the bright, golden shore; 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door— 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Some one is resting from sorrow and sin, 
Happy where earth's conflicts enter not in; 
Joyous as birds, when the morning is bright, 
When the sweet sunbeams have brought us their 
light. 
Weary with sowing and never to reap, 
Weary with labor, and welcoming sleep, 
Some one's departed to Heaven's bright shore, 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door— 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Angels were anxiously longing to meet, 
One who walks with them in heaven's bright street; 
Loved ones who whispered that some one is blest,— 
Free from earth's trials and taking sweet rest. 
Yes! there is one more angelic bliss,— 
One less to cherish, and one less to kiss; 
One more departed to Heaven's bright shore. 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door— 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door.

DONT GO MOLLIE DARLING. 
As sung by C S. FREDERICKS. 
Oh Mollie my darling the anchor is weighed, 
The ship is now ready to sail o'er the sea, 
Each moment is precious, and time will not wait, 
Oh, Mollie my treasure, do listen to me. 
You're going far away from kindred and friends, 
Off to the land that is far o'er the foam 
We've no one but you, to gladden our hearts, 
Don't leave us Mollie, sweet light of our home. 
CHORUS. 
Don't cross the sea Mollie, and leave us alone, 
For dreary our beautiful home then will be, 
We've no one to care for but you Mollie darling, 
Don't leave us Mollie, Oh! listen to me. 
Oh. Mollie my darling, your Father is ill, 
But still he has come down to see you depart, 
He stands by your side in our sorrow and pain 
And tears tell the anguish that lies in his heart. 
Oh, come to my arms let me fold you again 
Close to my heart that is throbbing for thee, 
Remember the days when I 
sang you to sleep, 
Don't leave us Mollie to cross the blue sea.

Sunny Days Will Come Again. 
As sung by MR. JOE NORME. 
Though to-day be dark and dreary 
And black clouds around us rise, 
Let us halt not nor be weary 
Light is looming in the skies! 
Aid and cheer each fellow creature 
Gainst the storms that round us lour, 
Soon they'll wear a 
brighter feature. 
And the sunshine come with pow'r. 
CHORUS 
Never boys, give way to sorrow, 
But be up and act like men 
Look with hope for joy to-morrow 
Sunny days will come again !-
Let us throw aside all sadness, 
Better times are on the wing; 
Who can tell what joy and gladness 
Providence to us may bring. 
Nerve then every manly feeling, 
And with courage, meet the storm, 
Let us wounded hearts be healing 
And our duty still perform. 
Never boys, & c. 
We should not be always sighing, 
Nor indulge in wild dismay! 
Bear in mind " old Time" is flying 
Therefore wisdom more display.. 
If our prospects be not shining 
And our hearts be bowed with care 
Where's the good in our repining; 
Still look up and ne'er despair. 
Never boys, & c.

And whispered softly "keep my child," 
And then they told me she was dead. 
Come sister come, & c. 
Dear sister come and hear my prayer. 
Now e're I 
lay me down to sleep; 
Within my Heavenly Father's care, 
While angels bright their vigils keep.

To keep my soul in paths of light 
Oh! let me thank Him for His love, 
E're I 
do say my last good night. 
Come sister come, eze._

Mother bear me to the Window. 
As sung by BEAUMONT READ. 
Mother bear me to the window, 
Now the birds begin to sing, 
For I 
love to hear their music 
And inhale the breath of spring. 
For I 
feel the time is coming 
Feel that it will not be long 
When the joyous little minstrels 
Can not wake me with their song. 
CHORUS. 
Hark'tis the angels whisp'ring, 
They wait to waft her spirit home. 
Never more among the flowers 
Shall you darling Nelly roam.

Now the rose begins to bloom; . 
For I 
love to see them thriving. 
And to breathe their sweet perfume. 
Yes! I

Once more growing round my home, 
Never more among the flow'rs 
Will you darling Nellie roam. 
Mother I

SLEIGHING SONG. 
As sung by CHARLES BACKUS. 
Come, jump into the sleigh boys, 
Come, burry now and start; 
The horses mad are foaming, 
Impatient to depart. 
There's Kate and Sue, and Nelly too 
Already at the gate; 
And pretty girls in plenty now, 
The merry Sleigh await. 
Cllosus—Jingle, jingle, jing, 
The bells so merry ring, 
Of sleigh bells, and pretty belles, 
Oh! gaily we will sing. 
Away! the wind is sharp and cold, 
The snow is falling fast; 
Our horses dashing gaily on, 
The town will soon be past. 
Our robes are warm, our hearts are light, 
We've pretty girls beside; 
We'll shout and sing, there's no such thing, 
As danger where we ride. 
And now the pelting snow balls, 
Alight with heavy crack; 
Thrown from another passing sleigh, 
Behind, upon our track. 
What care we, our journey's end, 
Will soon be here we know; 
Then hey! for merry dances. 
The fiddle and banjo.

THE MOCKING BIRD. 
As sung by Mr. JOE NORR1E. 
ONLY A 
WITHERED ROSE. 
As sung by C. S. FREDERICKS• 
Only a 
withered rose it seems to thee, 
Yet day by day it grows dearer to me, 
I 
know its beauty fled long months ago, 
I 
know its petals red turned white as snow 
Yet dear it is to me as when it grew 
Fresh dearest one from thee 
Breathing thy name. 
I 
know its beauty tied long, long ago, 
I 
know that flowers beside more beauteous grow 
Yet I 
still cherish this one gift from thee, 
Symbol of' earthly bliss, thy love for me. 
Oh, though the rose may fade or bloom decay 
My love shall e'er be made 
Brighter' each day.

Thou art so Near and yet so Far. 
As sung by the great RICARDO. 
I 
know an eye so softly bright, 
It glistens like a 
star at night; 
My soul it draws with glances kind, 
To Heaven's blue vault, and there I 
find 
Another star as pure and clear, 
As that which mildly sparkles here. 
Beloved eye, beloved star, 
Thou art so near and yet so far. 
That eye so soft like violets blue, 
A 
treasure bears of morning dew; 
And when its light entranced I 
see, 
What joy, what pain possesses me. 
A world where I 
would gladly dwell 
Is that bright orb I 
love so well. 
Beloved eye, beloved star, 
Thou art so near and yet so far. 
If closed at last that radiant eye should be, 
No more the day would dawn for me; 
If death should dim its laughing light, 
Oh, then for ever, ever 'twould be night. 
Those eyes that brightly, softly shine, 
For me the sun and moon combine. 
Beloved eye, beloved star, 
Thou art so near and yet so fin%

SEEING NELLY HOME. 
As sung by D. S. WAMBOLD. 
In the sky the bright stars glittered, 
On the grass the moonlight fell, 
Hushed the sound of daylight's bustle, 
Closed the pink-eyed pimpernell. 
As down the moss-grown wood path, 
Where the cattle love to roam, 
From Aunt Patty's quilting party 
I 
was seeing Nelly home. 
Cnones—When I 
saw sweet Nelly home, 
When I 
saw sweet Nelly home, 
How I 
bless the August evening 
When I 
saw sweet Nelly home. 
When the Autumn tinged the greenwood, 
Turning all the leaves to gold, 
In the lawn by alders shaded, 
I 
my love to Nelly told; 
As we stood together gazing, 
On the star-bespangled. dome, 
How I 
blessed the August evening 
When I 
saw sweet Nelly home. 
When I 
saw, etc. 
White hairs mingle with my tresses, 
Furrows steql upon my brow, 
For a 
love-smile cheers and blesses 
Life's declining moments now.

As sung by C. S. FREDERICKS. 
When the whippoorwill is calling, I 
will meet thee Mattic 
darling 
Yes, I'll meet thee at the elder near the tree, 
For your heart to me is so true, I 
am longing to caress you 
As in Spring time when we used to cross the lea. 
The pale moon so full and swelling, it will light you from 
your dwelling, 
So remember Mattie dearest meet me there 
And a 
shower of loving kisses will help constitute our 
blisses, 
While I 
nestle beds of roses in your hair. 
When the whippoorwill is calling and the dew is softly 
I 
will press thee to my bosom Made dear, 
For your flowing golden tresses, and your loving warm 
caresses 
I 
do cherish so, and long to have them near. 
Then the tiny stars will twinkle, and the dew the grass 
will sprinkle, 
While the firefly shows at intervals its light. 
So remember Mattie darling when the whippoorwill is 
You must meet me with your smilling face so bright. 
CHORUS. 
When the whippoorwill is calling, sweetly calling Mattie 
darling, 
When the whippoorwill is calling—whippoorwill. 
When the stars begin to twinkle and the dews begin to 
sprinkle, 
I 
will meet thee at the call of Whippoorwill.

SWEET GENEVIEVE. 
As sung by BEAUMONT READ. 
Sweet Genevieve I'd give the world 
To live again the lovely past; 
The rose of youth was dew impearled, 
But now it withers in the blast. 
I 
see thy face in every dream, 
My waking thoughts are full of thee, 
Thy glance is in the starry beam, 
That falls along the summer sea. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Genevieve, dear Genevieve 
The days may come, the days may go, 
But still the hand of mem'ry weays 
The blissful dreams of years ago. 
Oh! Genevieve my early love, 
The years but make thee dearer far, 
My heart from thee shall never rove, 
Thou art my only guiding star, 
For me the past has no regrets, 
Whatever the years may bring to me, 
I 
bless the hour when first we met, 
The hour that gave me love and thee. 
Thou art my own my hearts delight.

Thy presence alone can cheer, 
Thine eyes they shine like diamonds bright. 
Thou art my own my hearts delight. 
Without thy smile life would be drear, 
Thy presence 'tis alone can cheer, 
My own sweet dear, my heart's first love, 
Thou art my own my peerless dove. 
Thine eyes they shine like diamonds bright, 
Thou art my own my heart's delight. 
And should a 
storm-cloud rise to chill our love, 
I 
pray to him who rules above 
To lead thee to the realms of light, 
And dwell with thee where all is bright. 
Without thy smile life would bo drear, 
Thy presence ' tis alone can cheer, 
My own sweet dear, my heart's first love.

KILLARNEY. 
As sung by BEAUMONT READ. 
By Killarneys lakes and fells, 
Em'rald isles and winding bays, 
Mountain paths and woodland dells, 
Mem'ry ever fondly strays. 
- 
Bounteous nature loves all lands 
Beauty wanders every where, 
Foot- prints leaves on many strands, 
But her home is surely there, 
Angels fold their wings and rest 
In that Eden of the -west, 
Beautious home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders, or besprints, 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Ev'ry morn Spring's natal day; 
Bright hued berries daff the snows 
Smiling winters frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair. 
Beautious home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

LITTLE DAISY. 
As sung by D. S. WAMBOLD. 
There's a 
light hearted maiden that lives in the vale, 
And they call her the charming little Daisy ; 
When my work is done, to see her I 
ne'er fail, 
Though her beauty it nearly drives me crazy, 
By day or night wher'er I 
go, her bright eyes on me 
beam, 
Laughing like the dancing moon- light beaming on the 
running stream. 
CHORUS. 
Oh darling Daisy, ' tis of thee I 
dream 
With thy blue eyes beaming. 
Brighter ne'er was seen; 
Sweet darling Daisy still of thee I 
dream. 
Laughing like the dancing. moonlight 
On the running stream. 
When away from my love all the weary long day, 
Thro' the hours oft I 
feel sad and lonly ; 
But when Daisy I 
see, all my fears pass away, 
For she whispers she loves me only. 
By day or night, where'er I 
go, her bright eyes on me 
beam, 
Laughing like the dancing moonlight beaming on the 
running stream.
