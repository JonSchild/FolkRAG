On a 
cold winter's ev'ning, when bus'ness is done, 
And to youc home riu retire, 
What a 
plcAsure it is to have a 
bright bouncing boy, 
One whom you love to admire; 
You hug him, ant kiss him, yon press him to your heart, 
What joy to your bosom ' twid bring; 
Thet you place him on the carpet, 
And you'll hide behin 1 
the chair, 
And to please him you'll co.nmence to sing:

Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo 
Co:ne from behind the chair! 
Peek a-boo! peek-a-boo . 
I 
see you hiding there ; 
Oh! you rascal. 
There. 
Oh, my heart's always light when at home whh my wife, 
There joy and peace eve! reign ; 
With my boy on my knee I'm as happy as can be, 
I 
never knew care or pain ; 
lie's pretty, he's gentle, he's kind and he is good. 
Anti ev'ry thing nice, hint I 
bring; 
Oh, if he attempts to cry 
When I am standing by, 
Just to please him I 
commence to sing; 
reek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! &c. 
When the sunshine of Fond- eade.5, and age bends us low,-/ 
iike the birds, flown away ; 
Then the smiles or our children ever brighten the path, 
Leading where loved ones do strly. 
The music and laughter we ever love to hear, 
Will beam like a 
rain- bow in tlaing; 
By the fire-side at night. 
With our hearts so free and light, 
Vlio will liatou wlgic ont: olaildren sing:

Sweet music you will hear,

Wherever it may be,

They have such melody.

I

love singing; 
I

They're all the world to me. 
The Irish songs are soft and sweet, 
They harmonize so well,

The meeting of the waters," 
Or the " Emigrant's farewell," 
There's Bobby Burns. the Scottish hard, 
Whose memory shall reign, 
In Scotland where be lived and died, 
And honor'd was his name. 
In speaking of our poets great, 
There's one now whom I'll name, 
His praise is sung both far and near, 
He's well known for his fame. 
'Tis William Cullen Bryant, 
Whom Americans adore, 
His works are read throughout the world,

spoke to her 
Of young love's sweetest dream,

While whisp'ring words of love.

Only To See Thee, Darling.

Only to see you, darling, 
Only to hear your voice, 
Even it's faintest whisper 
Would make my hear*, rejoice. 
Vainly I 
crave the sunshine 
Thy love would e'er impart, 
Longing once more to see thee, 
Once more before we part 
Cflontre. 
Only to see 3 
ou, darling, 
Only to hear your voice, 
Even it's faintest whisper 
Would make my heart rejoice. 
Gone is the sunlit future, 
Vision of joy so bright, 
Now every gleam bath faded, 
Vanished in darkest night. 
Too late, alas I 
I 
knew thee, 
Ah I 
could my poor heart tell, 
Breathe out it's bitter anguish 
In that sad word, farewell.

I'll tell you of a 
party, at Mrs. Reilly's hall, 
Attended by the quality, who one and all did call, 
They came from tar and near, to sing, dance and play, 
To hear them shout with laughter, would make your heatt feel 
gay. 
I'll now describe their actions, if attention you will pay, 
Show you how they sang and danced, from night till the break 
of day, 
I'll try and ape their movements, in their peculiar style 
Especially the dancing of Lynch and Biddy Doyle. 
At last the party ended, and some commenced to go, 
They looked for Quinn, the fiddler, in corners high and low, 
At last they found him sleeping, his head between the 
or, 
And when they woke him up, at Cregan he did roar: 
Oh 
Come and pay the fiddler, that play'd for ye all night, 
Show me Lynch the wrestler, with him I 
want to fight, 
He 'inked at Biddy Gra ly, while I 
for him did play, 
lie's no man if he leaves roe, he stole my love away. 
There was Mrs. Regan, Mrs. Crean, Mrs. Kane and Doyle, 
Mrs. Leary, Mrs. Cleary, Mrs. Walsh and Boyle, 
Airs. Dooly, Mrs. Hooly, Kelly and O'Brien. 
And big Tom Quinn the tiddler, a

In the summer time when all is fine, 
And the trees and grass are green, 
When the boys arc drinking lager beer, 
And everything's serene. 
On Toin McDonnell's old tin roof, 
The boys do dance at night, 
With Kitty Malone and Mary Shea, 
Who sing with all their might, 
They have a 
big aceordeon, the music it is grand. 
You'll hear them shout for miles away, 
Faith they never will go home, 
While they can have a 
tune 
And " Tracy ' on his instruments will play. 
It's polkas, waltzes, quadrille s'na
ul
sl
. night, ' tis finer 
than the op'ra bouffe; 
If you don't believe I'm right, call around there any night, 
And you'll find us ou McDonnell's old tin roof! 
They call themselves the midnight owls, 
They dance by light of moon, 
To start for home at two o'clock, 
They said it was too soon. 
They keep the folks awake at night, 
Th y 
never have their rest, 
'To sing their songs and play their tunes, 
They do their level best. 
The music it is charming, it really is divine, 
"l'is finer than the opera, when they do the Boston dip, 
Frctli the house rocks like a 
ship; 
On ! there's no place like McDonnell's old tin roof, 
Across the street from where I 
live, a 
German keeps a 
store, 
lie's a 
baket roan by trade, he's worth a 
thousand or more. 
Ile keeps about rive men at work of course they're up all night 
But when they hear the music play they shout with delight, 
About the rime the brea,1 is bak'd the boys and girls e.escend, 
They don't stop till they've reached the door then they'll 
skip across the street. 
And the bread they'll nip so neat, 
Oh 1 
you ought to hear the bakers how they roar.

I've got a

But the devil a

Sometimes she cannot be found. 
If I 
say stay at home, begorra she'll get mad, 
She'll call me an ould tad, say I've got them bail

To a

CHORUS. 
Ah, but if I

The la-de-da dance, the trade-la dance, 
On the top of his nose I'll make my fist prance, 
And twist off the both of his legs, ha, ha I

At night she'll put on her fol-de-lol-lols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand calls. 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll wear my coderie pants, 
My chin-chilly vest, or anything by chance: 
But if I

THERE'S 
ALWAYS A 
SEAT 
IN THE PAR-
LOR FOR YOU. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, and performed by the great 
SCANLAN & CRONIN. 
Ifusie published by F. W. HELMICK, 
No. 50 Fourth Street, Cineinnatti, Ohio. 
The subject to- night of my song is love, 
Somc,thing quite heavy to bear ; 
When that being you love to you prover 
For none else in the world do you care. 
The lady I : cve is an angel divine, 
And w:th her my life I 
would share: 
But whene'e: I 
go to her house her to see, 
There is alwais somebody there. 
SPOKEN.— I 
explaio.ed the matter to her the other evening, 
ai.d when I 
had tinished, ,,
he looked into my Lee this way, and 
said, that's nothing— 
Cmonus. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for yon, 
No matter hew many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A. sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair; 
I 
went to her house one evening last weed, 
You may easily judge my surprise; 
I 
was just going to enter the hallway when 
I 
met that which opened my eyes. 
For there stood a 
man both tall and stout, 
Who said what do you wish here ? 
Grabbed me by the neck, threw me out on the walk, 
And the last words I 
could hear while there was--
Po N ot Leave M e, Darling. 
Written and composed by Wm. J. Scanlon. 
You say you're going to leave me, love 
Farewell if we must part; 
To see my darling go from me, 
I 
know ' twill break my heart. 
God knows I 
loved you better than life, 
For what is life to me 
When you. are gone and I'm alone, 
A poor outcast I'll be. 
CHORUS. 
•Do not leave me, darling, 
Do not leave me here, 
We've happy been, we'll happy be, 
Su do not leave me here. 
(Repeat.) 
When I 
fail to see your face, 
My heart will ache with pain, 
From mine eyes the tears will drop 
Like the heavy falling- rain. 
And when you cease to thing of those 
Whose love for you did burn, 
There will come a 
day that you'll repent, 
Then to me you'll return.

POuR 
BUT A 
GENTLEMAN STILL 
By Wm 
J. ;- ca hlan. 
Sang by Scanlan & Cronin. 
The Irishmen are out to- day, all dressed up in the style, 
With blooming shamrocks in their bats, and faces 
boin to smile; 
Old Erin's flag is flying with Columbia's starry gem, 
And our friends are out to cheer and shout for 
the gallant Irishmen, 
C
HORUS., 
Then Irishmen to the front hurrah I 
The fife and drum we hear, 
With step so gay we march away, 
While all the people cheer, 
The ladies, too, with hearts so true, 
Appiand llti now and then, 
And on St. Patrick's Day they love to see 
The gallant Irishmen. 
We march the streA so graceful, with the 
marshall in advance, 
The band plays up an irish tune, and it almost 
makes us dance; 
There's such delight it brings us back to wild 
Ireland once again, 
With banners proudly floating o'er the gallant Irishmen, 
Chorus. 
At night we're ready to join the fun and take 
a 
social glass, 
We talk of dear ould Ireland, the shamrock 
and the grass, 
We laugh and sing and our feet we fling, like 
Trishmen so trm:r, 
And if there's a 
fight, why, ft's our delight to 
show what we can '-o-

I've gone and begged from door to door 
To keep out the hunger and cold;

Oh, Willie, , ear Willie, our mother is dead, 
Our mother whom we loved so dear; 
She's sleeping to- night in her cold, cold grave, 
No more will she be with us here. 
How happy we were when by the fireside, 
With mother we'd sit all alone; 
And what stories she'd tell to both you and I, 
laut now she has left our dear home.

Yes, mother has gone to Heaven above, 
And there's one thing of you I 
would crave; 
As children should do for a 
mother so true— 
Put a 
headstone o'er her beloved grave. 
How often, when sickness icept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
Half so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to us be so gentle and kind. 
Yes, morning and night, she'd watch our sick brows, 
Never thinking of rest; 
But now she has left us alone here to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest.

When e'er I

And the haypy times we had, 
At home in dear old Ireland, 
It makes my heart feel glad. 
When I

That sweet recollection is to me, 
How 1 
wish that they were here,

But now I'm old and my life is quickly passing, 
Soon I'll be laid away cold in my wave, 
And my mother and my father's blessing I'll 
remember, 
That blessing to me which they fondly gave. 
I 
was but, a 
boy fifteen years old 
When I 
was left alone, 
To wander through this wild world 
Without a 
friend or home. 
I 
had to ern my living, 
And that I 
did quite well, 
So when I 
meet with good old friends, 
Those things I 
love to tell.

Anew a

Mulberry Street Policeman." . 
My name is Olfalleran, and fron Ireland I 
came, 
And since I 
came here I've gained great fame; 
The captains and aldermen all know me well, 
And my herosim and bravery tney can easily tell; 
If at ni.-1)t, on my beat 
walk to and fro. 
The blackguards they see me, arrah from rue they'll go, 
To an alleyway or har-rooln they'll run if they can, 
For they all know well fm a 
brave policeman. 
CHORUS. 
For as I 
promenade my beat at night through the street 
I'm admired by even young lady I 
meet; 
You'll hear them all shrli as haril us they can, 
For they're all deep in love with this brave policeman. 
When I 
first came crom Ireland I 
was rather green, of cour3e1 
But I 
very soon got Stuart when I 
went on the force; 
'Twits then I 
picked up. and my couragt.di,1 show, 
And was greeted no matter where'er I 
did go; 
As we led the parade on Saha Patrick's day, 
You can bet we looked grand as we all marched away;

And respected no matter wherefer E 
inhdtt be; 
They put sthripes on my arms to heo

For they knew I 
was a 
hero from dear Paddy s

But it's very strange, my friends, if f

For there's not a

RIVAL JUNK MEN. 
Originally performed by S
CANLAN & C
RONIN, the most ped.aq 
Representatives of Irish Character now on the 
American Stage. 
Have ye's any ould rags or ould bottles, my friends, 
That ye's want to sell ? 
I'm " Paddy -Welsh," of the Fourth Ward, 
And of me ye've all heard tell. 
I'm known by every chick and child 
As a 
man of great exploit, 
And to be mayor or alderman, 
If I 
said the word I 
moight. 
I'm twenty long years in this land, 
For politicians I 
have no use. 
I 
neither ax nor borrow their aid, 
And as for me they can go to the deuce. 
As up the street I 
go each day, 
They know who's corning, well. 
With my bag on my back, I 
shout, 
Any ould rags or ould bottles to sell. 
(dance.) 
ENTER RIVA.L. 
Good evening to ye's, one and all. 
I 
see ye're looking well. 
I 
suppose ye all will be surprised 
At what I'm going to tell. 
I've been travelling about the Ward all day, 
Not a 
pound of rags can I 
buy, 
Because that blackguard, " Paddy Welsh." 
Has been there on the sly. 
But I'll take my oath that I'm a 
bloat. 
If I 
don't make him sick. 
The first time I 
clap my eyes on him 
I'll paralyze him with a 
brie; 
It11 twist his nose till the blood it flows, 
And ma he'll remember, well. - 
To come no more in the Sixth Ward, hollering 
Any ould rags or ould bottles to sell 
Now what's the use of all this fuss? 
Our reputation I'm sure we'd spoil 
To see us quarreling here like dogs, 
Two sous of the Emerald Islo; 
So let us shake hands and be good friends, 
This rivalry let us stop, and to bind the bargalt! 
Let us go and of whisky take a 
drop. 
But there's one thing we must bear in mind, 
That our rules are sobriety. 
Sure if they found out we drank rum 
We'd be kielied out of the Society. 
So say no more but on we'll go, 
Or some one they might tell; 
And we'll go about our business, hollering. [What 11
