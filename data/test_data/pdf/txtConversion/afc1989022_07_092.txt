Also has work to do in Hollywood, at an art museum. 
GP's uncle was a famous artist in Italy. 
GP went to the Academy 
of Art in Naples. 
GP's uncle was also named Giovanni Palomba. 
When GP was a little boy, he went with his uncle all over Europe. 
Then he came here and 'built up his own name,' doing the same type 
of work. 
He painted Saint_ 
Peter's Catholic church in Los Angeles •

from San Diego to San Francisco. 
Paint, paint, paint. 
Rih"o-•; 
GP used to live near the Dodger Stadium, then when his wife passed 
away he sold their house. 
He had a friend in Palos Verdes, and he 
fell in love with the area, with the ocean, because Torre del Greco 
is near the ocean. 
He has lived here for about nine years. 
[Sounds of GP's wife making espresso in the background.) 
GP did 'restaurant work' all over the United States. 
GP hasn't 
done much work in San Pedro, only in a few houses. 
His work is 
too expensive, 
only found in million-dollar homes. 
They can't 
afford it here. 
He must have high ceilings to see the paintings 
well. 
He just painted the ceiling in his apartment to show 
prospective clients. 
It's better if the ceilings are twenty-feet 
high. 
GP has a few friends in the San Pedro Italian community, not much. 
He's better-known in Los Angeles.

GP asks Doug DeNatale how long the project will be in San Pedro. 
DD explains project. 
?• -Cameo carving: 
GP was teaching it an art center in Torrance, but 
in this kind of area , people only want to work for two days. 
You 
need patience , love. 
It might take two years to sculpt a cameo. 
GP thinks that people in an area like New York appreciate that type 
of art better , here, there is so much Indian jewelry. 
DD asks whether this is true for the whole population , or whether 
the Italian community has a better appreciation of cameo carving. 
GP: No, they 're all fishermen here. 
But GP doesn't know that much 
about it, he 's just here because he loves the ocean. 
GP got involved with the Traditions Festival because he did some 
work for the City Museum in Los Angeles. 
He demonstrated cameo 
carving at_the museum in Los.Angeles,_and they 
fold -the organizers 
of the San Pedro festival . They were looking for all the artists 
in San Pedro. 
GP learned the cameo carving at a school in Torre del Greco, named 
after Maria Piemonte , the queen of Italy. 
Then GP studied in 
Venice, where most of his family was located . This was fifty years 
ago, before GP went into the army in 1937. 
GP has done cameo 
carving all his life, because he loves it. 
Sometimes he sells a 
cameo, but very few. 
[GP's wife shows DD a newspaper article on GP from the Torrance 
Daily Breeze , November 3, 
1983, 
"Italian Artist Plays a Cameo 
Role."]

Cameo is a type of conch shell. 
GP also carves in ivory and 
malachite. 
The cameo shell comes from the Carribean and from 
Madagascar. 
'Over here we have diamonds, over there they have &ucr 
cameo, in Italy.' 
GP can do portraits as cameos. 
He just did one for a couple in 
Illinois . The man saw GP demonstrating in San Pedro, and sent a 
picture 
of 
his 
wife 
for 
a 
cameo 
for 
the 
couple's 
fiftieth-wedding -anniversary. 
Mural painting: people sometimes request particular scenes, and 
sometimes they let GP create a scene. 
Sometimes they want a scene 
from their own country. 
American people want scenes from America. 
The man in Appleton , Wisconsin, will let Palomba paint his own 
creations.

impressions 
of 
Italian 
community 
in 
San 
Pedro: 
most 
Sicilian and Ischian, most belong to Mary Star of the Sea Church 
-- GP didn't do any of the work in the church. 
They have a 
community here, but GP is too involved in his work. 
Hasn't done 
much work here, only one or two homes. 
GP and his wife usually 
eat at home. 
GP and his wife do go dancing at the Alpine Village, 
ballroom style dancing. 
They have a big orchestra there. 
GP and 
his wife have many friends over there, 
Italian people, 
German -
people, all mixed. 
They love dancing. 
GP and his wife belong to Saint Peter's Church in Los Angeles, the 
main Italian Catholic church in California.

GP doesn't know how did the tile work at Mary Star of the Sea 
Church. 
It's a beautiful church. 
GP and his wife like to go to 
an Italian Mass. 
GP has one married daughter. 
His son-in-law is "vice-director" of 
Los Angeles 
library. 
He has two grandchildren. 
Talk about 
children's artistic abilities. 
Talk about difficulties in visiting 
grandchildren. 
Does GP have much contact with other Italian communities in the 
U.S.? 
Talk about man who has a chain of fifty Italian restaurants W.4o 
throughout the U.S., GP has decorated many of them. 
The one he is 
decorating in Appleton, Wisconsin, belongs to this man. 
Talk about 
this company. 
Owns a restaurant in Beverley Hills called "Vive La 
C-Fr 
Pasta." 
GP went to South America while he was in the Italian Navy. 
School for cameo-carving in Torre del Greco -- named "Maria di 
Piemonte." 
They teach sculpture and art. 
Cameo art was the art 
of the king years ago. 
GP started going to this school at age 
thirteen. 
GP doesn't know when the school was founded. 
The school 
has a big exhibition building where the tourists can go. 
They have 
people that work in the studios. 
GP demonstrates cameo carving. 
Cameo shells are like glass, you 
have to use sharp cutting tools. 
If GP works at cameo carving 
regularly, he can cut one in two or three hours, now it takes him 
about a day. 
Profiles take less time than full-face portraits. 
The depth of the relief and the size of the cameo affects the 
amount of time. 
The shell itself is called cameo in English. 
In Italy they are 
called corneola (sp?). 
Another type of shell is sardonica (sp?). 
The sardonica shells come from Tahiti, the cameo shells come from 
Madagascar. _ 
First you examine the shell with candlelight to determine the 
translucency, then cut a blank. 
Then you smooth the blank. 
The 
blank is glued to a holder to make carving easier.

months of the year, 
then during the grape harvest, 
in August, 
September, and October, the shop is open seven days a week. 
T.M's fafhPr camp from Sicily  when he was 18. 
First he settled in 
Colorado, then he came to this area. 
TM was born in Los Angeles 
in 1924, so his father must have come sometime before the 1920s. 
TM's father was a bar Pr,_ worked as a barber in Colorado, probably 
in an Italian community there, TM thinks. 
TM married into the wine business, married in 1950, then became a 
partner with his father-in-law. 
Has been in the business for 
thirty-seven years. 
1 TM's father was a barber in San Pedro, had a shop on Seventh 
'Street. 
The neighborhood around the winery was the Italian neighborhood. 
These were all fishermen in this area -- they didn't have cars, so 
they lived within walking distance of the docks. 
The Italians were 
ninety percent of the neighborhood. 
The neighborhood went up to 
Gaffey. 
Now they have cars, 
so the Italians moved up into 
"P.V."--Palos Verdes. 
They used to say that beyond Gaffey there 
was rabbits.

Now the neighborhood is mixed, Yugoslays came in, then they got 
ofok, 11< into fishing. 
Now the old timers have died off, and the younger 
\ generation, a few are still here, but they kind of got out of town. 
k 
s 
• 
r TM's father had no family connections in San Pedro. 
He came from 
Palermo. 
TM has traced his name back to Sicily. 
Back in the 
seventeenth century, Sicily was a melting pot, just like California 
is today. 
People didn't have last names, they picked their names 
from the place they came from. 
Marbella is a town in Spain, so TM 
probably has Spanish blood. 
That's why we're darker -- also a lot 
of Greek people went to Sicily. 
TM has a photo of Marbella from a magazine. 
TM compares it to San 
Pedro -- lots of fishing boats. 
TM's family stuck an "a" into their name for some reason. 
A lot 
of guys couldn't speak English real fluently, so they mispronounce -
their name and someone writes it down. 
TM's father had his barber shop until he died about thirty years 
ago. 
The family lived in Los Angeles, and his father had the shop 
in San Pedro. 
Eventually they moved to San Pedro. 
In Los Angeles

they lived at 50th and Central Avenue, that was the Italian area 
at that time, there were all Italians in that area. 
TM's wife's family came from Ischia. 
His mother-in-law is still 
living, age 91. 
The brother of TM's father-in-law started the winery in 1932, then 
the father-in-law took it over. 
The business supplied the local 
community with grapes and juice. 
During Prohibition you could make 
wine, and the Italian people, 'that's their food. ' So the business 
supplied

r Riverside area. 
butforthepast 
In 
ten 
years, TM has done his own farming. 
That's why he's only here two 
days a week. 
TM knows all of his customers, most of them now are old Yugoslays. 
TM joined the business in the 1950s, before then he was in the 
used-car business. 
TM's family didn't make home wine. 
People aren't making wine now like they used to. 
People don't 
drink 
wine 
like 
they 
used 
to. 
People 
used 
to 
drink 
a 
half-a-gallon, gallon of wine a day. 
The whole family drank wine, 
the kids too. 
Now the people who were brought up on that wine 
don't care for it, so people don't make it any more. 
What happened 
is that during Prohibition you had to drink homemade wine because 
you couldn't drink winery wine. 
The old timers got used to 
homemade wine, they couldn't drink commercial wine because it had 
preservatives in it. 
Sometimes it affects your stomach. 
So they 
continued to make their own wine. 
But the younger generation for 
some reason don't like. 
It's gotten so bad that TM has three boys, 
and none of them are going to take over the business, they see what 
TM has put up with -- long hours and low pay. 
There are a few old 
timers left who make wine, and a few younger ones, but not much. 
Now the market is more dispersed -- TM has to go to San Diego, San 
Fernando, Palm Springs, delivering 
juice. 
They crush grapes and 
deliver the juice in tank trucks. 
Years ago they never got out of 
town, now it's the other way around, everything's out of town, and 
there's hardly anything left in San Pedro. 
TM has been selling equipment for home beer-brewing for only the 
last ten years. 
The wine is about two-thirds of the business. 
It's mostly young people who are home brewing--they come from all 
over. 
San Pedro's a small town, strictly a residential place, not very 
good for business. 
TM started farming about ten years ago. 
He got fed up with dealing 
with the farmers, they'd lie to you all the time, they don't do 
what they say they're doing to do. 
TM contracted with the farmers

before 
then. 
TM 
farms 
about 
150 
or 
160 
acres, 
about 
an 
hour-and-a-half away. 
TM lives about three miles from San Pedro. 
It's getting to be a real drag to go back and forth because of the 
freeway. 
TM has two men who work year-round for him and they hire 
more during the harvest. 
TM has been selling his own wine only in recent years. 
Saw the 
rest of the business slowing down, so he got in the wine business, 
about five or six years ago. 
People came in asking for "Dago Red," they remembered it from years 
­'back, lots of old-timers made the Dago Red, the dark, heavy wines, 
so TM just put the name on the wine. 
TM grows all his own grapes. 
TM doesn't know how many tons he crushes, less than a 100 tons. 
The press in back holds two tons of grapes at a time. 
Have a big 
crusher-stemmer. 
That's always been part of the business. 
TM's father-in-law's family made wine in the old country for their 
own personal use. 
TM doesn't know how they got into it here. 
'I 
guess money drove them, because in those days there wasn't any.' 
It's a hard business. 
TM's sons think he's crazy. 
Today you don't 
have to work hard. 
One of TM's son is a draftsman, one is a diesel 
mechanic, does injection work, and a third does maintenance. 
They 
all work with their hands. 
This one here (son working in the shop) 
is a draftsmen, but he doesn't like it, he wants a job working with 
his hands. 
TM tries talking him out of it. 
There must be 
something in them that makes them want to do it. 
They can tell 
there's no money in it, you can only make so much working with your 
hands. 
You get some satisfaction out of it, that's all. 
What's kept TM in the business? 
He enjoys it. 
A guy's got to have 
a place away from home to go to. 
TM's just about retirement age, 
but he's not even thinking of retirement. 
Thirty-seven years, and 
he's never hated to go to work. 
Sometimes on Sunday, he's down 
here. 
It just relaxes him. 
There were other people in San Pedro in the same business, but they 
d 
all got out of it. 
Thirty years ago there were two others. 
Now 
N!, 
TM's the only one within a hundred miles. 
The Italians and a few 
Yugoslays make wine, but the other nationalities don't seem to make 
j wine. 
People don't grow their own grapes, 
there's not enough wine. 
People made 50 to 200 gallons per family. 
That takes a lot of " 
grapes. 
They always got their grapes somewhere else. 
TM has always sold grapes and juice. 
Years ago it was mostly 
grapes, nowadays it's mostly juice. 
As the old timers got older, 
they didn't want to do the work and switched to juice. 
DOUG 2 \

Years ago making wine was a big thing. 
Families used to help each 
other . One family would make wine and the other families would 
t l come to help them , 
have a big party, barbecue, and everything. 
Not 
any more. 
Now you have to go out and hunt for help. 
People were 
, 
f4 
closer years ago than th ey are to day . Every Sunday you spent at 
•• 
someone's house . TM's cousins lived in Los Angeles , and they used 
to spent one Sunday in San Pedro, one Sunday in Los Angeles That's 
why people drank a lot of wine, because they had more company. 
It 
was an all -day job to press wine . It took two or more men.

/Process of winemaking: crush the grapes; check the sugar and see 
if there's enough, if not, you have to add sugar ; check the acids, 
make sure the acid balance is right; and then you let it ferment. 
To test the sugar you use a hydrometer, to test the acid you use 
an acid-test kit. 
The old timers did it all by feel. 
They'd feel 
the grapes, they'd crush the grapes , and when the grape became 
I sticky there was enough sugar. 
Some of the old timers would come 
in here a dozen times , check the grapes every day, and when the 
grapes pleased them , that's when they made the wine. 
When they got 
! ready, that's when they bought. 
They were very particular about 
their grapes. 
Years ago, 
people made a hundred gallons , up to two hundred. 
That's very rare today . They used fifty-gallon barrels. 
You let it ferment four days of so, in a big tank, and then you 
press it, put it in a press to separate the juice from the pulp. 
Whatever comes out of the press goes into a barrel, and then it 
ages in there . You can start drinking it in about three months. 
A hundred gallons is not very much wine , even two hundred gallons 
isn't a gallon a day. 
The old timers would blend different types of grapes to get the 
flavor they like. 
The Italians like darker wines, the Yugoslays 
like lighter wines . That's why you made homemade wine, to get the 
taste that you like. 
You have no control over the taste of wine 
you buy in a store. 
TM has eight or ten different varieties of grapes. 
People buy the 
grapes that they want, or they buy the juice and TM blends it for" 
them. 
Have tastes in home winemaking changed? 
They used to make much 
better wines in years back. 
They were real finicky with their 
wines. 
DOUG 2 \ 
9 
Were there people who had a reputation for their wines in the 
community? 
Oh yeah, some people make better wines than others. 
TM can't remember who. 
He's been in a lot of homes. 
[Talk with a customer.] 
The ones that worked harder at it made the better wines. 
You have 
to work with the wines, racking the wines more often. 
It's work. 
You can't get something for nothing. 
You can tell right away when 
you taste a person's wine whether he worked at it. 
The ones that drank a lot drank from the barrel. 
What would be the difference between the wines back then and now? 
Flavor-wise, wines were more natural back then. 
Everything is 
pasteurized now, you take away all the homemade flavor. 
Once you 
put something in to clean it, you're taking away the flavor. 
Young 
people today don't know what true flavor is. 
They want clean wine. 
It preserves better if you haven't got any sediment in it. 
If it 
has 
sediment, 
it 
could 
actually 
ferment. 
again. 
TM 
puts 
preservatives in his wine. 
'You don't want any come-backs.' 
Once 
a bottle is on a shelf, the temperature is no longer cold, and if 
you don't have any preservatives in it it will turn. 
When people 
had the wine in their cellars, they didn't have to worry about the 
temperature. 
PEI &K 
Wines that TM makes: Dago Red, Burgundy, Rose, Chablis, Sauterne, 
Riesling, Chardonnay. 
TM's wine is made at a winery in Mira Loma. 
He brings them the 
grapes and they make the wine for him. 
He's in the wrong zone to 
make wine in San Pedro. 
Everything here has to move out fresh. 
This is a commercial zone, not a manufacturing zone. 
Winemaking is a big business today. 
You have a lot of competition. 
TM only sells out of his shop. 
[TM answers phone -- someone asking for advice on winemaking.] 
Sulphur is used for fumigating the wine barrels, but people also 
buy them to fumigate homes. 
The community is changing quite a bit. 
You used to be able to walk 
down the street and know everybody. 
Now you don't know anyone. 
It's depressing. 
In the last two years. 
[Talk with customer.] 
This neighborhood is changing bad. 
Italians and Hispanics get along all right. 
TM hires Hispanics 
DOUG 2 \ 10 
for grape harvesting. 
Not much contact unless you're working with 
them 
(Hispanics.) 
Used to be Italians around here, 
now it's 
Hispanics. 
TM doesn't think the town is booming. 
It's strictly 
a residential town. 
(Talk with customer, bargaining over price.] 
TM comments that all the customers that have come in have been 
Yugoslavian. 
The Italians were here first, then the Yugoslays came 
in. 
They did real good, took over the fishing, got bigger boats. 
They're real ambitious people. 
TM has never had a chance to go to Italy. 'I've been raising kids 
all my life, it makes it hard to get away.' 
One of TM's sons is still home, and comes in every weekend to help 
out. 
San Pedro is getting more commercialized, more apartments have 
moved in, 
it's not what it was before. 
It's going to become 
strictly a residential community, 
too expensive. 
It's a good 
community as far as weather, you can't beat the weather.

When TM's father-in-law owned the company they called it the 
Southern California Fruit Company, TM doesn't know why. 
He changed 
the name ten years ago. 
TM sells concentrate for fruit wines. 
The Italian community never 
made wines out of fruits, strictly out of grapes. 
Fruit wines have 
come in only in the last ten years or so. 
DD asks whether TM can recommend any winemakers for the project to 
talk to. 
TM suggests that DD speak to a man (Frank Pontillo) from 
Los Angeles who comes in every Saturday. 
He goes to Italy every 
year; and he makes wine.

Recorded on Marantz PMD-430, lavaliere microphones. 
TAPE 1 OF 2 
SIDE A 
Tony Pirozzi (TP) arrived in San Pedro on April 5, 1956. 
He came 
with his parents and his sister . One of his aunts invited to come 
to San Pedro. 
San Pedro was not like it is today, there was not 
much work, only fishing. 
TP ended up fishing. 
He had fished in 
Italy with his father. 
TP is from Ischia. 
TP 's father had stomach 
problems, had to have an operation , so he ended up working in the 
cannery . 
TP didn't have any friends , didn't know any of the 
Italian people here. 
But after a few weeks he started making 
friends. 
He would ask people, 
'Do you know the scores of the soccer games 
in Italy ?' 
TP was a great soccer fan. 
They told him that they 
sometimes got the scores in the Italian paper published in Los 
Angeles, got the scores a week or two after the games. 
So TP 
didn't know what to do -- in Italy he listened to the soccer games 
every Sunday. 
So he wrote a letter to the Italian Radio and 
Television System in Rome, and the wrote back that they broadcast 
the games every Sunday on shortwave. 
So TP saved, and after he had 
been here for six months he bought his first shortwave radio. 
At 
six o'clock in the morning he would tune in. 
Sometimes the 
reception was bad, but he was able to get the scores the same day. 
TP had a friend, Johnny Lauro , who had a radio program. 
TP told 
him that he was getting these scores from Italy. 
TP gave Lauro 
the scores, 
and he broadcast them over the air. 
Got a big , 
response . After that , they started giving some Italian news, that 
TP was getting over the shortwave. 
Lauro invited TP to read the 
news over the radio . TP was afraid of the microphone. 
A few 
months later , Lauro couldn 't go to the radio station, so TP had to 
fill in for him. 
The show was live -- this was in 1957. 
The show 
AD 0 
4' 
DOUG 2 \ 13 
is still on, on KTYM in Inglewood. 
The engineer told TP to get in 
front of the microphone, and he would give him the signal. 
TP was 
shaking, but didn't make any mistakes. 
Afterward, everyone called 
him at the house. 
Since that time, TP has been doing the show. 
Lauro's program was a music program, popular songs. 
That's what 
they do today -- they're still doing the same thing. 
The program 
is two hours every Sunday. 
The show goes from 12:30 to 2:30 in 
the afternoon. 
TP has done other things. 
Have done television shows, but it's 
too expensive. 
TV show has gone as long as six months, but there 
was not enough support so it folded. 
This was on Channel 22 and 
Channel 40. 
This was in 1960. 
here was a need for a soccer team. 
In 1960 they formed the first 
Italian soccer team in the area, and at the same time they formed 
the Italian-American Club. 
They haven't had the soccer team for 
the past four or five years, it got to be too complicated, so they 
just quit. 
Now, TP is involved with Dominic Manghisi in bringing 
groups of singers from Italy twice a year since . 1987. 
That's part 
of our tradition, we have to have something going all the time., 
It takes a lot of enthusiasm to do this. 
They've had over a 
thousand people at the concerts, last one was about seven hundred. 
Also have an Italian Festival, at the Alpine Village in Torrance, 
on August 19. 
This is separate from the Feast of Giovan Giuseppe. 
They are having the number one singer from Italy, Toto (?), coming 
in October. 
/
The Feast of Saint John Joseph: that's a saint that was born on 
the island of Ischia. 
Before TP came here in 1956, there were a 
few things where people would get together to observe the feast, 
they had a Mass in the church. 
But in 1960, when they formed the 
soccer team, they had a meeting at Mary Star of the Sea Church, 
and TP was the chairman of the first Feast they had, and they had 
c' 4C 
a dinner dance. 
So every last Saturday in August they have a day 
•0 •
40'%V 
of feast for the saint. 
In the morning they have a mass, and in 
6K '/ 
t• `V 
the evening they have a barbecue and a dance. 
This is part of the 
tradition that people brought from Ischia. 
In Ischia they have a 
three-day feast. 
In San Pedro they also celebrate the Sicilian 
Feast of Saint Joseph on the 19th of March. 
In Los Angeles they 
celebrate other saints' feasts. 
(•TP has never read a book about Saint John Joseph. 
He was born in 
1
 Ischia and always cared for sick people. 
He was in Naples for many 
years, that's where he died. 
He got very sick by taking care of 
people, that's the way he died. 
TP doesn't know the date when he 
died. 
TP remembers that they had a special feast in 1954, when 
they brought the saint's body to the island. 
TP was 17 years old. 
People were crying and clapping when the ship came in to the 
harbor. 
People really love him. 
Everyone believes in him. 
So we 
are keeping this tradition with the Mass for the saint, and we 
DOUG 2 \ 14 
honor him with the dinner-dance. 
K 
In Ischia the feast goes from Friday to Sunday. 
TP was there for 
the feast in 1975. 
He understands that they have a four-day feast 
now. 
They have booths in the street where they sell things, they 
have bands that they bring from the mainland . They have something 
they call the tritium, every night they pray to the saint. 
They 
do the same thing here: Thursday , Friday, and Saturday morning 
concluding with the Mass. 
They don't have home altars -- that's a different custom that they 
don't have in Ischia. 
First time TP saw that was here, with people 
from Sicily -- it's beautiful . For Saint John Joseph they say the 
rosary, and the priest talks about the saint's life. 
Don't have 
a procession. 
The Sicilians do have a procession for Saint Joseph. 
TP doesn't 
-get to see it because it's the time that he 's doing the radio show. 
ATP has a studio in his home . Years ago he did it live from the 
radio station . Now he does it in his home and transmits it over 
?I 
\•, the phone. 
ti 
The festival in August, they're bringing in singers from New York, 
some local singers, they're going to have two bands , 
dancing, food. 
This started about three years ago. 
'We found a way to lose some 
money .' 
It's hard. 
The community is not very supportive some 
times, but it's okay. 
It's good to mention to us. 
Some of us came here and really kept 
the traditions , even though we're living in a different society. 
And some people came here and changed . 
They put all 
those 
traditions behind them , like they don't exist any more. 
It's 
really sad to say that there are a lot of Italians that have done 
this . TP can't go on without those things , without the way he was 
brought up , they are very important to him . That 's why sometimes 
when they do these things , out of all the thousands of Italians in 
the area, only a minor percentage support these things. 
"Dominic Manghisi came to San Pedro about ten years ago. 
He had 
been in England , had worked on ships . He came to TP to ask him to 
do an advertisement on the radio -- he was doing something with 
another group, and asked TP to be the master of ceremonies. 
The 
last time TP had been an emcee was in 1958 , when he had done it for 
another friend , Johnny Lauro. 
Brought 'the number one singer of 
all time, Claudio Ville (sp?), to a concert in Los Angeles. 
They -
had 4700 people and the ticket was five dollars at that time. 
Lauro asked TP to introduce him. 
TP went on stage and said in 
Italian, 
'Ladies and Gentlemen, Good Evening .' 
It was the first 
time they had heard someone talking Italian on stage, and they went 
crazy. 
TP was nineteen. 
DOUG 2 \ 15 
Then Dominic Manghisi came along in 1987 and insisted that TP 
emcee. 
They had a full house that night at the theater here in 
San Pedro. 
Since then they've been doing these things together. 
They 've done six or seven shows together. 
At the program they did last spring, The Songs of Spring, they had 
two groups from Italy, and two from New York. 
They always bring 
a main attraction and put some local talent with them. 
But in this 
case the group from Italy brought their own people. 
They don't 
just come here, they tour the United States. 
They do this twice 
a year. 
They book the groups through an agent. 
People have always praised them for what they've done. 
It's a lot 
of work, but they do, always find the time. 
They do it to keep 
their traditions, their culture going. 
If we don't do it, someone 
else has to do it. 
Once people come to this country, they lose 
everything they were born with . Our traditions are washed away. 
All these things are done because we love where we come from. 
A lot of people lose their traditions, even the Italian people. 
When they hear that something is going on, they don't care. 
When 
something bad happens in Italy, like the flood in Florence in the 
1970s, they try to raise money, but some people refuse to give 
money. 
Lately, with television and the satellites, they have two 
hours of Italian programs a day. 
They're trying to have a school 
to teach the Italian language, which they've never had before. 
What has happened in the last five years, a lot of people are 
coming back. 
The people that have turned their back to the 
traditions are coming back. 
Because today Italy is one of the most 
progressive nations in Europe, it's done a lot. 
You see with the 
Italian restaurants , the 
Italian 
foods, 
the 
Italian names 
--
everyone uses them . You see 'gelato,' when TP came in 1956 if he 
said gelato, people would laugh at him. 
But today, 
instead of 
saying ice cream they say gelato. 
Those things are making people 
realize what Italy's about, all the culture, the lifestyle. 
That's 
changed. 
It was very hard before to talk Italian to someone. 
Friends from Ischia who came a few years before TP, he started 
talking Italian to them, and they started using a lot of words in \ 
English. 
He said, 
'I don't understand you, I just cam e .' 
They'd 
LANG AGC-
say, 
'I forgot .' 
They didn 't want to do it. 
People speak broken,/ 
English, but they won't talk to you in Italian. 
TP had some education in Italy, elementary and three years in high 
school. 
But a lot of people who came abroad, not just Italian, at 
the time it was the way of life, the parents couldn't afford to 
send them to school . A lot of these people have never gone to 
school. 
TP 's mother never went to school, she didn't know how to 
write her own name -- TP had to do it for her. 
TP's father had 
three years of elementary school. 
So, by not going to school, 
people from Ischia only know how to go to work. 
For th em , nothing\ BU•• 
else exists but to go to work and make a be tt er lif e for yourself.-/ W••a 
DOUG 2 \ 16 
V 
'00 
That's why a lot of them turned, because of not knowing anything 
about their culture, their tradition. 
But now their children go 
to high school, college, it's different. 
It wasn't a problem of people looking down on Italian. 
But TP 
remembers going to a dance at the Sons of Italy in Long Beach when 
he first came, and he had on an Italian suit, and everyone was 
looking at him. 
They just looked at him and knew he had just come 
from Italy. 
In New York a lot of bad things happened between the Irish and the 
Italians, but we never had anything like that here. 
To be Italian, or to say a word in Italian is exciting. 
When they 
do their shows, it's all in Italian. 
TP's kids say to him, 
'why 
didn't you teach us,' and he tells them that it's all up to them, 
it they want to study he has lessons and tapes at home. 
They 
\ didn't speak Italian at home because TP 's wife was born here. 
She 
was the one who taught TP to speak English. 
Three months after TP 
arrived here he met her. 
Her father was from Ischia, but her 
mother spoke English to them all the time. 
TAPE 1 OF 2 
SIDE B 
Differences between Ischians and Sicilians : 
The dialect is a 
little different . Sometimes they make fun of each other's words, 
but it's always in good taste . The only difference is religious 
customs, but if you really study it, it's all the same. 
They have 
a different type of food in Ischia -- the pasta is all made with 
tomatoes in Ischia. 
In Sicily they make pasta with all sorts of 
things. 
For holidays, like Easter, the Ischians make different 
types of cookies and cakes. 
Sicilians make things with sugar, just 
sugar. 
Ischian foods: pasta pomidoro -- it's very popular, you put 
it together in fifteen, twenty minutes: fresh tomatoes, oregano, 
garlic cooked just a little. 
Sicilians use a lot of fish, too --
TP doesn't know the names . Ischian foods : 
on Sunday they have just 
macaroni 
and 
sauce , on 
other 
days 
they have 
spaghetti with 
something else. 
If they don't have the macaroni and go to church, 
it's not Sunday. 
The macaroni are mostaciolli and tagliatelli. 
[Dominic Mangisi talks about other types of pasta and sauce.) 
The older people used to make their own pasta -- now it's very 
popular. 
Vegetables : tomatoes , fava beans , lima beans, 
peas, 
broccoli, 
chickoria (sp?). 
Talk about community garden where people grow 
vegetables. 
Some people bring seeds from Italy -- it's illegal,-- D0'1,•6rr,9 
but they put them in their pockets. 
They bring their own things, 
lT""Q"' 
and they have their own foods. 
Even fruits, like kumquats, figs. 
DOUG 2 \ 17 
There's 
something, 
wherever you 
come 
from, 
you 
always 
bring 
something from your land. 
TP gets very excited when he goes into 
a delicatessen and sees foods from Italy. 
His wife says, 
'don't 
you see the prices?' 
TP doesn't care about the prices. 
He might 
just buy a little bit, but he gets really excited. 
Now we may soon 
have prosciutto from Italy, because there was a ban for many years. 
American people have gotten used to Italian foods. 
There was a 
time when people didn't know what finocchio, fennel, was. 
Today, 
in the market it's the most expensive vegetable you can buy. 
TP 
had it in his backyard. 
There was a Sicilian guy who owned it 
before, and when they moved in fifteen years ago, TP's kids used 
to pull it from the ground. 
TP's wife had never seen it, so they 
threw it away. 
One day, TP saw it and asked his wife where they 
got it, she said, 'in the corner over there, there's a lot of them, 
the kids have been throwing them away. 
TP said, 'No! We eat those 
things!' 
Another fruit that is in the markets now is figi d'india, cactus 
fruit. 
In Italy it's very popular, now it's a gourmet food -- you 
pay two dollars each. 
In Italy they throw them away. 
Talk about eating fresh vegetables, like radish, with pasta, to 
'clean the stomach.' 
other things important to Italian identity: what's really important 
to the people, we always try to improve ourselves, to do better 
things. 
We might not help the next-door neighbor the way we 
should, but we like to be at peace with each other, not to make bad 
names for ourselves, if we don't have the possibility of buying a 
house, we work harder and harder, and try to make it. 
Our image 
is very important. 
When you walk down the street, you walk with 
your head up. 
When we hear about the mob, on television they talk 
about the Italian people going to the mob -- that doesn't bother 
TP. 
The Mafia came from Italy, but also a lot of good, working 
people, a lot of culture. 
The majority is for better things. 
We 
are very proud of what we are and where we came from. 
Even the 
ones w o a k about how they made their money here, that they're 
American, if you talk bad about the land, they're very patriotic., 
Any race is probably that way. 
The soccer team was connected with the Italian-American Club. 
Originally it was the Italian Sports Association. 
The original 
idea was not to just have soccer, but to get involved with American 
sports like baseball. 
But they couldn't get people interested in 
that, so they based everything on soccer. 
The idea was to bring 
people together. 
On Sunday, when they had a game, they had three 
or four hundred people. 
DOUG 2 \ 18 
[Talk with customer. 
DD talks with Dominic Manghisi about World 
Cup Soccer. 
Manghisi coming to San Pedro, starting a food supply 
business for the cruise ships.] 
DM: singing in Italy is very important, everyone sings. 
When DM 
first came to the U.S., he worked in a restaurant, and everyone 
wanted him to sing -- if you don't sing, you're not Italian. 
TP: Not everything is always perfect at the shows that TP and DM, 
but so far they've been lucky. 
DM: In the past, people were just trying to make money from the 
Italian community. 
We want to make a profit, but we also want to 
give people what they pay for. 
TP: 
[Shows picture of exterior of store during a celebration in 
1982.] 
Since TP got out of the soccer team, 
it has folded. 
There's a group of young people, but they just get together to play 
on Sunday, don't belong to a league. 
Today, people don't care as 
much to go to a soccer game, because they can watch soccer games 
on cable TV. 
TP started showing soccer games_ 
on TV. 
When the 
satellite began beaming soccer games from Italy fifteen years ago, 
they started showing the games in New York at the Felt Forum. 
TP 
called I1 Progresso, the Italian newspaper in New York, and they 
gave him the number of the producer, it was the man who was behind 
Muhammed Ali. 
TP asked him how much it would cost to get the tapes 
of the soccer games. 
He told TP that he was only the technician, 
and gave him the name of the real producer, who agreed to sell TP 
the tape for three hundred dollars. 
TP rented a videotape machine 
from Channel 34 to show the tapes, and they got a projector. 
TP 
rented the Warner Theater. 
They had about 100 people, 
and TP 
charged ten dollars each, made a thousand dollars. 
It cost him 
$850 dollars, so he made $150. 
A year later, Sony came out with 
the first Betamax. 
Frank Briguglio got one for TP for $1275, cash. 
Had to convert the tapes from 3/4 inch to 1/2 inch to use it on the 
player. 
Went to Disneyland to do the conversion. 
Did this for two 
years. 
Showed them first at the Italian-American Club, then at the 
store -- used to have fifty people here every Sunday. 
TP bought 
the first satellite dish, cost him $4700, eight years ago.

SIDE A 
Tony Pirozzi (TP) always had to do something. 
'When they put me 
in the box, I'll stop.' 
TP doesn't drink, sometimes he goes to 
Las Vegas--
Dominic Manghisi (DM): It's his hobby, it's the Italian feeling ,p.VC(G 
TP: some people like to stay home and watch TV. 
Outside his work 
and his responsibility to his 
family, 
he wants to always do 
something for the community. 
What he has always done was something 
that was missing in the community. 
Now he doesn't show the soccer 
game any more because anyone can have a satellite dish. 
What he 
does is something that no one else is doing, something that is 
missing in the community. 
He always finds something to do. 
Once 
they stop with putting on Italian musical programs, they'll find 
something else. 
It makes you want to live, it makes you stronger. 
TP doesn't want to be recognized for it, he's just doing it because 
it's in him. 
It's just something that he wants to do. 
His kids 
look at him, he's the only one in the family like this. 
He has 
three sons and a daughter, and only one son, Anthony, is like him, 
he wants to do things. 
TP came over because he had an aunt here. 
If you had someone in 
the family here, they could fix the paper for you. 
His aunt called 
his mother. 
She could come with his father and two kids. 
So they 
came and left the other four over there, but after a few years the 
other ones came, and now the whole family's here. 
TP went fishing for three years. 
It was a bad time, no money or 
nothing. 
His father was working at the cannery. 
The first few 
years were really bad, they had to tighten their belts. 
Then TP 
went to the cannery -- he didn't like it. 
If it hadn't been for 
the fact that his parents were here, he would have gone to work in 
a restaurant washing dishes until he had made enough money to go 
back to Italy. 
But little by little you get used to it. 
TP didn't have the time to go to school, so he used to buy Teen 
Magazine -- that's where he learned to read and write English. 
He 
went to National Technical School in Los Angeles. 
They said, 'You 
never went to school -- can you read and write English.' 
TP said 
yes. 
They asked him where he'd gone to school, he told them in 
Italy. 
So they gave him a test. 
TP passed it, and right away he 
quit fishing, and went to technical school to learn about radios 
and televisions. 
It was fascinating to him. 
He graduated in" 
eighteen months, he did everything at night. 
In the meantime he 
worked for a company in Long Beach cutting steel and aluminum. 
When TP was working there, he saw something that other people 
didn't see -- the foreman would bring him a blueprint showing him 
what to cut, and he couldn't read it, so they'd have to tell him 
DOUG 2 \ 20 
Me rc 
how long to cut the pieces. 
So without telling anybody, TP went 
to Harbor College and took a class in blueprint reading. 
He used 
to go from five to seven. 
In three months he learned blueprint 
reading. 
Right away, they gave him a raise in pay and promoted 
him. 
TP graduated from technical school in 1964, and opened this 
store in 1965, and has been here ever since. 
In 1982, TP said on the radio, 'On Sunday, if we beat Brazil, we'll 
be world champions, you all come to San Pedro and we'll have a 
celebration. 
But if we lose, you stay home -- and I don't want to 
see or hear anyone for a few days.' 
That's what TP said right on 
the radio. 
That Sunday, everybody came. 
And in 1987, TP is from 
the province of Naples -- they have a very strong soccer team, but 
they've never won the championship. 
But on May 10, 1987, TP told 
his wife, 
'This is my team, this is my town, I want to be there 
when they win the championship.' 
With a couple of friends, TP took 
a flight on Thursday at 9:00 a.m., 
went to the stadium, 
saw { 
everything, and that Sunday he had a telephone connection from 
Naples for his radio program. 
Then on Monday he came back. 
Four 
days--he went to Naples just to see, because he loved it. 
TP's 
father was crazy about this game -- he told TP, 
'I cannot go -- 
this year Napoli is going to make it -- you go.' 
That's why TPJ 
went. 
In 1976, the national team of Italy came here for the bicentennial 
of the United States, in Washington, New York, and Connecticut. 
TP and his father went for five days. 
Saw a game in Yankee 
Stadium, went to New Haven, Connecticut. 
TP began the radio program in 1957, six months after he came to 
the U.S. 
Sports news was the main thing. 
TP only does half-an-hour during the two-hour Italian show. 
Does 
music, Italian news and sports. 
Today, TP can call a special phone 
number and record the news from the Italian news service. 
[Talk with Dominic Manghisi about possibility of photographing on 
cruise ships.] 
TP always gets the newspapers from Italy. 
He is in daily contact 
with Italy. 
They never found out through the Italian government 
what happened to the money they raised as 
aid after Italian 
disasters. 
Someone has to go there. 
This was done after the 
earthquake 
near 
Naples. 
In 
the 
early 
1960s, 
there 
was 
an 
earthquake in Sicily, and people are still living in tents -- with 
all the money. 
TP received a letter, he has some cousins, they 
wrote a letter to TP's father, they organized, they got big trucks, 
they were going to Avelino -- the Comorra stopped them-'you leave 
the stuff here, we'll give it to the people.' 
They were selling 
the stuff on the black market. 
These things happen. 
TP wants to 
see it with his eyes -- he wants to give a hundred dollars, but he 
wants to see that the person really needs the money. 
Soc<C4 
DOUG 2 \ 21 
But you can't solve everything, but it's good to talk about it. 
TP is from Ischia Ponte. 
That's where Saint John Joseph was born. 
They have a little chapel there. 
The Italian priests at Mary Star of the Sea are not from San Pedro. 
Things will get better with the Italian community in San Pedro as 
time goes on. 
Most of the community is well-off financially. 
TP 
thinks things will get better and better. 
He expects more support 
for what they are doing, more members in the Italian-American Club. 
It's true that most of the membership of the Italian-American Club 
is Sicilian and the membership of the Italian-Catholic Federation 
is Ischian. 
It's not that there's any friction. 
It's healthy to 
blend together. 
A lot of times there's a little misunderstanding. 
TP has made a lot of Sicilian friends. 
The majority of people 
raising money for the soccer team was from Sicily. 
The majority 
of the Sicilian people took over the club after the Ischian people 
left 
for other things. 
The club identifies 
itself with the 
majority, but there are a lot of members from other parts, so it 
won't hurt anything. 
TP knows that whatever he does, they will 
support him. 
This used to be a soccer shop, it was TV and Radio and Soccer, a 
good combination. 
There was a book of odd names that had a picture 
of the shop. 
Someone took a picture from the parking lot across 
the street. 
Under the picture it said, 'What a combination!' 
It 
didn't work out, because soccer is seasonal, and TP needed the 
space for something else, office space.

Commentary, 
calls of encouragement, 
judgement calls: mostly in 
Italian with occasional English interjections. 
(Occasional wind 
noise.) 
Frank Pontillo (FP): When you concentrate on the game, it works 
out better for you. 
Fred Arduini (FA): started playing when he was eight years old. 
FP: Started playing when he was about twelve or fifteen, back in 
Batavia, New York. 
In those days the Italians played amongst 
themselves for wine. 
They didn't use much beer in those days. 
After they played, the winners would pay for the wine, so to speak. 
They'd play, they'd have to put eight glasses of wine up there. 
Now, you have to figure out whose going to drink this wine. 
They 
had a game they played they called _ r-oone et Soutre (sp?) -- Boss--- Gtlo"`e 
and Underboss. 
They would throw out fingers here, get around in 
a circle. 
Then they'd count the fingers. 
Let's say there's 
twenty-four. 
They'd start with me and count around to twenty-four. 
Twenty-four would come to me, I would be boss. And you're next to 
me, so you'd be underboss. 
Chances are, you're on the opposite 
team from me. 
So now what you're going to do, you're going to try 
to get all your teammates to get a drink, you're going to make sure 
that I don't invite my teammate and give him a drink without your 
teammate getting one. 
So this is where the action starts. 
I've 
got to figure out how I'm going to get those drinks away from you 
-- because you're the second boss, but you have the last say. 
So 
what I would do, I'd take a drink of wine, and I'd invite Freddie, 
because he's my partner, and you would say to me, 
'legitime(?).' 
That means that I've got to let you give that drink to anyone you 
want, not that I want. 
Now if I felt like, maybe I'm thirsty, and 
the glasses are only this big, and it's the first game, I know that 
you're going to give that drink to one of your partners, and I 
don't particularly want to give him a drink. 
So I take this glass 
of wine and drink it myself. 
Now I can drink all the wine I want, 
you can't say nothing to me about it. 
So then I say to you, 
'I 
want to give two glasses of wine, 
one to Freddie and one to 
Pasquale, because they are my partners.' 
I'm going to give one 
glass to your partner. 
I'm going to give my guy twice and him one. 
You have to say, 'okay. 
In that case, I've got two of my partners 
have drinks, and you only have one, you still have three guys going 
dry. 
And I've already drunk, so I only have one guy going dry. 
Now everything starts to boil -- these guys are saying, 'what the 
hell did you give him two drinks for to my one?' 
Now they're 
giving you hell. 
You say, 
'don't worry about it, I'll get him.' 
So then I'll say to you, 
'Okay, there's three glasses left over 
here, I want to give one to your partner, and one to my partner 
over here.' 
Cause I've only got one guy left who didn't drink. 
And in that case you're likely to say, nope, 'legitime' again. 
So 
now I have to make up my mind if I want to give you the glass 
legitime, meaning that I'm going to give them to you to do whatever 
you want to do with, or whether I'm thirsty enough to drink two 
DOUG 2 \ 23 
more glasses of wine. 
If I'm in good shape, I'll say, 'well, why 
not,' and I'll drink it. 
I'll say, 
'how about this last glass 
here, can I give it to Tony?' 'Nope.' 
So I drink that glass, too. 
So I've had three glasses of wine, I'm half-crocked, all of my 
partners 
drank 
except 
one 
-- 
I'm 
pretty 
happy 
about 
that. 
Meantime, you have only one guy to drink and three that didn't, 
including you. 
Now the plot thickens. 
Now we're going to play a second game. 
In 
this case the losers, now you're the guys that lost, and you've 
only had one guy to drink, so my side did pretty good I say. 
So 
we play the same game again to see who's going to drink. 
In that 
case, you might become boss, and then your partner could become 
second boss. 
So you could get it all if you want. 
Now you've got 
us right by the cojones. 
FA: You could play all night and not have a drink. 
FP: As long as you're in this game you're not allowed to leave it, 
or you're out for good. 
They still play that game in Italy. 
You 
don't see it over here much anymore because there isn't much 
[bocce] playing. 
In this club we didn't do it very much, because we played loser 
pays for the beer and everyone has a beer. 
At the Sons of Italy 
Club they used to play it, that's been fifteen years. 
FA: We played morra (sp?). 
Ga.• 
FP: This finger game, what I want to do is guess what he's going 
to throw, plus what I'm going to throw. 
We throw until one of us 
gets the right number. 
We're going to play for three points, and 
the 
winner 
gets 
a beer 
and 
the 
other 
has 
to 
pay 
for 
it. 
[Demonstrates game with FA.) 
Played in teams, five on each team. 
If I'm playing and I beat the first guy, I have to go down to the 
second one, right down the line. 
And I might beat all fifteen if 
I'm real good at, but we're more likely to be neck and neck. 
And 
we'll play three rounds, and then those guys pay because they lost. 
And then we get this game going, Padrone and Soutre. 
This was before television days. 
What the hell are you going to 
do, go home and talk to your wife and kids? 
You went out with the 
boys, had a little fun. 
FA: Then you had the Italian card games, briscola (sp?), tres sept \ 
(sp?), and scoba (sp?). 
> 
FP: You could play with three, four, or five players. 
You played 
with  Italian,-cai•1p, there's only forty cards in a deck, and there's 
no numbers on the cards, every card has got an insignia, and that 
tells you what the card is. 
They're widely played today. 
They 
have them at A-1 grocery, next to the cash register. 
They have 
M,n AILS 
DOUG 2 \ 24 
three different types of cards: Napolitan are this kind. 
There are 
four suits: bastone, Spada, cope, and dineiro (sp?). 
The King is 
the highest, the Queen is the next, and then the Jack in American 
cards; well, in Italian cards it's the opposite: King is high, Jack 
is next, and Queen is on the bottom. 
The Queen is never above a 
\ 
man in the old way of thinking -- they always put them on the }s 
bottom, for more reasons than one. 
FP is first-generation Italian-American, but he learned so much 
because he enjoyed hanging around with the older generation. 
He 
used to listen to everything they had to say, it was fascinating 
to him. He just can't wait to go visit Italy. 
FA was born in Pennsylvania. 
When he went in the house he spoke 
Italian, if he spoke English he got kicked out of the house. 
He 
was born in McIntyre, Pennsylvania, fifty miles from Pittsburgh. 
FP: We used to call that three-foot coal country. 
FA: 
Started working in the mines when he was seven years-old, 
shovelling coal.

SIDE A 
Andrea Briguglio (AB) came to San Pedro in 1979. 
He was born in 
1960. 
'When I came here I used to cry.' 
He couldn't speak any 
English. 
He was over here with his parents and his brother. 
His 
brother spoke a little bit of English, because he was in England. 
for four years. 
'We have parents (relatives) but, they just make 
a fiesta for a few days, party for three days and then you don't 
see them for months.' 
AB was living at his Uncle's house. 
/ 
AB came from Cinise (sp?) near Palermo, in Sicily. 
The family came 
here for a 'vacation,' and when they got here, they stopped here. 
\ 
REcE

DOUG 2 \ 25 
AB's father died five years ago. 
When he got here he said, 
'the`. 
hills are like in Sicily, we'll like it here, the weather's good.' 
So they stayed a few months, then AB's father went back to Sicily/  
and didn't come back. 
AB met his wife and got married in the first year, and then his 
father went back to Sicily. 
His mother stayed here with his 
brother. 
Then his brother decided to get married, and moved to 
Detroit. 
Now AB's the only one here. 
'I've got parents: an aunt, 
cousins.' 
But AB doesn't want anything to do with them. 
Frank 
Briguglio 
is 
AB's 
cousin. 
They've 
got 
money. 
They're 
millionaires. 
AB doesn't want anything to do with them. 
If he 
sees them he says hello, but other than that, they don't get along 
at all. 
AB's family stayed with his 
a house. 
After AB was here 
at a grocery store. 
They

He said, 
to get out.'

AB has two children, a boy and girl. 
AB was working for his relatives in Los Angeles. 
They used to pay 
him $3.50. 
After one year, when they wouldn't give him a raise, 
he couldn't work with them any more. 
He quit and went to work in 
the fish market. 
Frank 
Briguglio 
owns 
a market 
in 
Los 
Angeles 
with 
his 
brother-in-law, 
Galletti 
Brothers. 
Al 
Galletti 
is 
his 
brother-in-law. 
G lletti 
is AB's cousin. 
Frank Briguglio's 
sister, Sarah, married Al Galletti. 
AB's brother's name is Joe. 
He lives in Detroit. 
AB's parents 
are Francesco and Giovanna. 
AB's mother is still alive, in Sicily. 
She doesn't want to come to San Pedro. 
She said, 'What am I going 
to do there? 
It will be like a jail.' 
AB told her she could do 
anything she wanted here, but no way. 
It's better for her. 
AB has 
tried to bring her here for vacation, but no way. 
She came a 
couple of years ago before AB bought the house, and then she went 
back. 
[AB's daughter, Joanna, enters.] 
AB named her after his mother; 
Giovanna. 
He has a Francesco and Giovanna -- Frankie and Joanna. 
Frankie is seven-and-a-half, and Joanna is five. 
AB's brother, Joe, was here in San Pedro, but was dependent on his 
cousins. 
AB's mother had to clean their house--she didn't come 
here to clean house, she never wanted to do that. So Joe Briguglio 
saw the picture of a friend's cousin at the friend's house. 
The 
cousin came here for vacation at Easter, and AB's brother met her, 
Q 
uor r 
/,"..  ",I& 
DOUG 2 \ 26 
and they got engaged. 
For Christmas he went to Detroit, they got 
engaged, his mother went there too, and then after two or three 
months they got married. 
Then she came and lived here, they used 
to live on Fifteenth Street. 
But after a couple of years they went 
back to Detroit, because she didn't have anybody here, except AB's 
parents (relatives). 
AB's brother works for the government (?). 
You know those cement blocks on the floor when you park your car? 
He does those. 
And he does those cement blocks that separate the 
freeway. 
He makes good money. 
AB didn't work for the Galletti Brothers long, one year and then 
he quit. 
Then he worked for State Fish Company for five years. 
After he quit Galletti, he was out of a job, and a friend told him 
that State Fish was looking for a driver. 
They told him no. 
The 
friend told him to go back, they might take him. 
So he went back 
there, his wife was with her -- he didn't speak English at the 
time. 
So when the owner saw Frank [AB's baby son], 
she said, 
'okay, don't worry about it, we're going to have to have some food 
for this baby.' 
So he told AB to go home, he'd call him. 
So the 
next day he called him. 
AB worked there for five years. 
The owner 
used to sit in the office and look at AB, how he was doing -- AB 
knew how to work there because he learned it from his parents 
(relatives). 
AB started at $5.00, and he raised him to $7.00, 
$8.00. 
Then AB went to the union, and he put AB at union pay, 
$10.25 an hour. 
AB was making filet, and packing fish. 
He wasn't 
driving -- didn't know how to drive at all, drove a car, not a 
truck. 
After a month-and-a-half they put you in the union. 
They called 
AB and asked him whether he wanted to go in the union or not. 
AB 
said he didn't no anything about unions -- when AB worked for his 
parents (relatives) they didn't have any union. 
They told him if 
he joined the union he'd have benefits, so he said okay. 
He was 
working like a salary. 
If he worked five hours a day, they still 
paid him for eight hours. 
Sometimes they call you at night, the 
boat comes in and they have to unload the boat -- they're working 
for free, they don't pay them. 
And AB didn't like it, he didn't 
want to work for free. 
And after five years he quit. 
When AB's father died, when he came back [to San Pedro], AB found 
a new boss. 
Then they started to argue, and AB quit work. 
Then AB bought this business [fish truck]. 
Bought it about two 
years ago. 
Then he bought the house. 
AB bought the business from Vic [last name?]. 
Vic wanted to 
retire, his wife wanted him to retire, he didn't want to. 
He was 
kind of a cheap guy. 
His wife liked to go on vacation a lot. 
He 
didn't want to spend the money, he said he had to work. 
His 
brother, that one down there [Nick] is different. 
Before this, AB bought a truck, but he didn't have any customers. 
DOUG 2 \ 27 
He went for a week, bought the fish, and had to throw it away 
because he didn't have any customers. 
The guys in the market 
wanted their money. 
So what are you going to do? 
AB just decided 
to go out where there was a lot of people -- nobody bought nothing. 
Then Vic decided to retire. 
So AB bought his truck, too. 
AB went 
with him for a couple of months -- Vic didn't pay him. 
After two 
months he told AB he could go by himself. 
And AB started on his 
home. 
Vic had the route for thirty-seven years. 
His brother 
doesn't want to retire yet. 
It makes a lot of difference with an established route -- you know 
where to go. 
AB gets up in the morning and goes out -- he knows 
where to go. 
In the summertime it's slow, a lot of people are on 
vacation. 
When school starts again and they come back, it will 
start to go up again. 
Nick has a different route. 
AB took over Vic's route. 
Nick used 
to work four days. 
Vic gave one of his days to Nick. 
So AB works 
four days and Nick works five days. 
AB asked Nick to give him back 
a day, and Nick said not right now, he wants to wait a little bit 
because he has one son at home, and he wants to help him. 
Nick is 
about sixty-five. 
The job is not too hard. 
The job is just driving. 
AB gets up at 
6:20, 6:30 in the morning, goes down to the market and gets ice, 
buys the fish and puts it on the truck, and comes home for coffee, 
then he goes out. 
AB buys whatever he needs, then pays at the end 
of the week, on Saturday when they wash their trucks. 
They get the 
bill on Friday, pay on Saturday. 
Right now it's real slow. 
It's like going out for nothing. 
They buy different kinds of fish, four or five hundred pounds a 
week. 
They buy more in the wintertime. 
Right now people want 
halibut, salmon, and swordfish, that's all they want. 
In winter, 
they buy something else to broil or fry. 
Right now they want 
something to barbecue outside. 
Right now they don't want shrimp 
or clams, but in the wintertime those people will buy anything. 
AB comes back to the house for coffee, then goes out to Fontana, 
San Bernadino, Pomona, Ontario. 
Gets where he's going by about 
eleven o'clock. 
Not much work -- he finishes six o'clock when he 
goes up there, it's about seven o'clock when he gets home. 
But 
most of the time he sits down, talks with the people. 
A lot of 
the people come after five o'clock from work. 
In one hour AB can 
make more than he does in the whole morning, from five o'clock to 
six o'clock. 
The mornings are slow. 
You take care of offices, 
beauty shops, 
things like that. 
In the afternoon, 
after four 
o'clock, it starts to catch up again. 
AB goes to a different area each day. 
Monday, he doesn't work. 
On Tuesday he goes to Fontana, Pomona, Upland, and Claremont --
DOUG 2 \ 28 
four towns in one day. 
On Wednesday, AB goes to Whittier and works 
all day there. 
Thursday, AB works in San Bernadino. 
Friday in San 
Pedro. 
On Friday he comes home three or four times, if he has an 
hour he comes home and watches television. 
It's fun. 
In Whittier, AB stays one place for one hour, then he goes out 
again. 
It's a school. 
AB stays there from 3:00 to 4:00. 
People 
from the school buy fish, and then another seven or eight people 
come there. 
Sometimes only one or two. 
Then AB goes out on his 
regular route to the homes. 
He drives down the street and blows 
his horn, the people come out and buy fish. 
Sometimes there's five 
or six customers in one block, sometimes he has to drive five or 
six miles to get one customer. 
Sometimes people move -- right now 
AB has three or four customers -- one worked at a beauty shop, one 
worked at a doctor -- they moved five or six miles. 
AB has to go 
up and deliver fish to them. 
AB goes by and blows his horn, if they don't come out, he goes on. 
Some people have a sign that they put in a window. 
Some people put 
a stick out on the grass with a little fish like a balloon, so AB 
knows and stops by there. 
Margherita Briguglio (MB): Some people leave their ice chest out, 
too. 
AB: They leave a note of whatever they want, AB leaves the fish, 
takes the money and goes. 
Some people leave their doors open, so 
AB goes in, sees the sign on the refrigerator of what they want, 
leaves the fish and goes. 
When he goes back the next week, they 
leave the money and say, 
'next week I want this-and-this.' 
So AB 
puts it in the refrigerator with a note of how much they owe him. 
It's a kind of trusting. 
After so many years -- he used to have 
it for thirty-seven years -- and nothing's changed with AB. 
Only 
a few people who move someplace else -- you lose a few customers, 
that's all. 
Sometime you get a new one, they see you on the street 
and they want your phone number. 
If it's not too far, AB goes. 
You have to schedule -- you have to have a time you have to be 
there. 
People have to go out -- if you're early or late, they say 
something. 
It's better that you don't schedule too much so it goes 
smoothly. 
Sometimes they go out of their way for you before 
they're going out. 
MB: A lot of them call, too. 
For instance, they'll say, 'can your 
husband come right now, because I'm going out.' 
And he'll go. 
[DD gives MB project handout.] 
AB: American people believe in time. 
Italian people don't care. 
If we have to go someplace -- five minutes early or late, 
it 
doesn't matter. 
But those people, they mean it. 
If you have to 
be here at four o'clock, 
if you go at four-fifteen, 
sometimes 
hey're gone already, and you lose it. 
They wait for you. 
Time 
DOUG 2 \ 29 
is time, that's it. 
So you have to be there, you have to do 
whatever they want . AB can't depend on himself , he has to depend 
on them, 
whatever they say, 
you do , no argument , no nothing. 
Sometimes they're wrong and you're right, you have to shut up --
'Oh, you're right .' 
It's better to say nothing . Even if AB is a 
hundred-percent right, he's wrong. 
Otherwise you lose a customer. 
And if you do like that to everybody , you're going to lose all of 
them . If they say next week they want you to save some kind of 
fish, 
you have to save it for them, 
otherwise you're in big 
trouble. 
That 's the way they are . And that's what we do. 
Nick's route goes to Orange County, Long Beach, and Whittier. 
He 
goes twice to Orange County and Long Beach. 
AB goes to Whittier 
on Wednesday and Nick goes on Thursday . AB takes east Whittier, 
and Nick takes west Whittier . AB has a longer route, but Nick has 
more customers , because Vic gave half of the Whittier customers to 
Nick. 
TAPE 1 OF 2 
SIDE B 
t'l 
When AB bought the route from Vic, he bought the truck, too, with 
everything on the truck. 
When AB first rode with Vic, he made a 
map: right , left, the number of the house -- AB still has it in 
r
• 
the truck. 
After Vic told him that he could go by himself, AB` 
`didn't know where to go, even though he had the map. 
The first 
couple of weeks by himself was rough . He missed turns and was late 
on the schedule , had to tell people to take it easy on him because 
he was new. 
MB: Vic also introduced AB as a cousin, so the customers could 
trust AB just like it was Vic. 
AB: No, a nephew , AB was Vic's nephew . He told the customers that 
nothing was going to change. 
MB: 
He didn 't really lose any customers until 
the Whittier 
earthquake. 
AB: AB lost about twenty customers from the earthquake , because 
they moved . Those people got scared and moved away. 
AB has not 
yet built the route back up again yet. 
Sometimes you find one or 
two customers . 
Sometimes you try a new customer, and after a 
couple of times when they tell you to come back next week, you give 
up on them . 
The old customers buy fish every week. 
The new" 
customers , if they don 't buy for a couple of weeks, they're not 
interested , what 's the use of going there. 
The customers are American people, a few Mexican people, but mostly 
American . No Phillipine or oriental. 
Nick has a few Oriental 
customers in Long Beach . Some customers are old and you have to 
DOUG 2 \ 30 
bring it to the house for them. 
Some can't walk at all. 
It's a 
kind of trusting. 
AB has been doing it for over two years. 
No 
problem -- AB likes it, work outside, talk to people. 
When AB 
worked in 'this business' [Galletti's?] he didn't talk English at 
all, 
'talked like a chicken.' 
He didn't get any help from his 
wife, just learned to talk on his own. 
When he worked for his 
parents [relatives], no English at all, only Spanish. 
Then when 
AB worked for the State Fish Company he started speaking a little 
English because it was American people working there -- no choice. 
Now that AB works 'at home,' no problem at all. 
Some people want 
to talk. AB hates that because they keep him five, ten minutes, 
they don't do anything, they just want to talk. 
Some people don't 
want to talk at all, just buy the fish. 
Some people like to talk. 
MB: That's the only way you'll have communication, though. 
AB: You have to talk, otherwise, if you say, 
'I got to go, I got 
to go.' 
For them, that's a disappointment. 
So you've got to talk. 
Sometimes you don't answer, whatever they say, 
then they say, 
'okay, okay, we've got to go.' 
Then they go. 
Otherwise, if you 
talk to them, they continue all day long, talking, talking. 
If you 
don't say anything, you might lose a customer. 
You have all kinds 
of customers, crazy, good people. 
AB has one customer that gives 
him trouble. 
They even called Vic one time, because he used to 
sell one kind of fish for another kind of fish. One customer was 
across the street, and both came out to buy fish. 
One wanted one 
kind of fish, the other wanted the same kind of fish, but Vic 
called it another name. 
So AB didn't know what to do. 
So he went 
to the other side of the truck (like he was getting another kind 
of fish). 
One called it Calico Bass, the other called it Orange 
Roughy. 
So that one she said, 
'no, that one is Calico Bass.' 
AB 
said, 
'no, that's Orange Roughy.' So they started to argue. 
That 
night she called Vic and told him that AB sold one kind of fish for 
another. 
So Vic called AB and asked him why
-he was selling one 
kind of fish for another, and AB said, 'I'm selling? 
You sell one 
kind of fish for another, so I'm in trouble.' 
Even the shark, he 
used to sell it for Wahoo -- Wahoo is a kind of Mexican fish. 
So 
sometimes two people come at the same time and one wanted shark and 
one wanted Wahoo. 
So he told one that he didn't have shark. 
So 
you learn, you keep one piece on one side of the truck and one on 
the other in case they both come out. 
Experience. 
Otherwise you 
lose a customer because she won't want anything. 
AB keeps ten or eleven different types of fish on the truck during . 
the winter. 
Right now, AB isn't selling much red snapper, used to 
sell forty to fifty pounds a week. 
People don't want to fry right 
now. 
Vic gave Nick the extra day before AB took over the route. 
Eventually AB will buy the extra day from Nick -- he'll buy Friday 
from Nick. 
A lot of people go out to eat on Friday, but they buy 
DOUG 2 \ 31 
the fish for Saturday. 
Last week, AB didn't sell much fish on 
Friday because of the Mary Star of the Sea Fiesta. 
On Saturday, they sell the leftover fish at the market. 
Yesterday 
was good, because they sold everything. 
But they have to sell at 
the same price that they do in the market, sometimes even less to 
get rid of them. 
Sometimes you can keep the fish for the next 
week. 
Yesterday, AB had to sell red snapper for $1.50 a pound that 
he had bought for $2.00 a pound. 
There's another fish truck that has just started, 
a man from 
Ischia, who sells in San Diego. 
He sells whole fish, not filet. 
He can only go when the boats come in. 
AB sold his old truck to 
another guy. 
AB doesn't know what he does. 
AB's customers will only buy from him, they won't even buy fish 
from the store. 
Some of them will buy fish for two or three days. 
The man who sells whole fish works for the State Fish Company --
when the boat comes in, he doesn't work that day. 
There are only three fish trucks in the area. 
There's another guy 
who comes from San Diego and buys squid. 
But those people don't 
work at it regularly like AB and Nick. 
Talk about health department regulations and problems with these. 
The only stationary place that AB works is at Whittier College, 
all the rest of his business is in homes. 
AB would love to take on the extra day's route. 
In the winter time 
you make pretty good money, but one more day wouldn't hurt you. 
Right now you're young and you want to work. 
You run out of things 
to do around the house. 
But it's not worth it to go out and try 
to develop a new route. 
AB has a total of about twelve hundred 
customers 
in two days. 
When everyone shows up he has about 
thirteen hundred. 
Right now he has about seven or eight hundred 
people, because every one is on vacation. 
Then he's really busy. 
It starts getting dark early. 
AB hates it when it gets dark, he 
wants to get home early, but you can't do that, you have to wait. 
AB's customers tell him when they're going on vacation. 
It puts 
him ahead on his schedule. 
Sometimes he forgets when someone is' 
on vacation. 
From week to week, you forget. 
You have to use your 
brain. 
MB: 
AB is always singing. 
AB: AB sings old style in Italian, like when he used to live there. 
DOUG 2 \ 32 
AB used to work in construction in Italy. 
So you work in town, you 
sing all the time, radio, a girl passes by and you whistle, happy 
all the time. 
You don't know the whole song. 
AB sings with Nick 
in the morning. 
When AB's happy, he sings in the truck, the people 
come out and say, 'Oh Andy, you're happy.' 
You say, 'how beautiful 
you are today.' 
And those people are happy. 
If you don't say 
nothing to her, forget it, you're dead. 
Sometimes they come out, 
they have a piece of shit, the dress, you tell them, 
'oh, you've 
got a nice dress today, where do you have to go?' 
They say, 'You 
like it, Andy? Beautiful, huh?' 
And they dance a little. 
That's 
when you make a customer happy. 
If you don't say nothing --
MB: They feel comfortable with you. 
AB: 
You keep them happy. 
Some people you don't have to say 
nothing. 
They buy the fish and that's it, goodbye. 
Some people 
you have to tell, 
'how beautiful you are,' even if they're ugly 
like a monkey. 
That's when she's happy. 
AB bought this house in September, 1987. 
He bought it from Vic. 
Vic used to live here. 
Vic built the house for $3700 thirty-five 
years ago.

TAPE 2 OF 2 
SIDE A 
Andrea Briguglio (AB): When they bought their house, there was 
carpeting and wallpaper, outside there were bushes all around. 
Margherita Briguglio (MB): It was Christmas all year round -- there 
was red carpeting and green carpeting. 
AB: AB took everything out. 
He didn't like it. He doesn't even 
like this marble. 
MB wanted this marble, so they put it on. 
This 
isn't the kind of marble you can use here -- it's easy to break. 
But it was cheap -- $2.50 a square. 
So if it lasts six or seven 
years, AB doesn't care. 
It's easy to keep clean -- carpet is dirty 
all the time. 
AB wanted marble, but not this kind. 
AB wanted a 
DOUG 2 \ 33 
more expensive kind. 
This was on sale. 
MB: MB had furniture in storage, and this color matched all her 
furniture. 
AB: Talk about installation of marble. 
It's wood underneath -- in 
the old country it's cement underneath. 
So here it moves around, 
and cracks. 
Floor isn't level. 
People in Sicily use marble or 
tile. 
A lot of people use marble in the dining room and living 
room, and tile in the bedroom. 
The construction business in Italy is entirely different. 
AB tried 
to work construction here, but couldn't do it. 
Here they have 
cinder block -- everything has to be straight -- AB hates that. 
In Sicily, they cover it with stucco, so everything doesn't have 
to be straight. 
In Sicily they don't use a level, just use a line. 
When they bought the house, they painted, redid the ceilings to 
give them a rough texture. 
Talk about former owners of home. 
AB wants to take out the wood panelling in the den and paint it 
white. 
He likes it light, a little more air. 
MB: 
It's good for the kids now while they're small. 
AB: AB hired someone to build the wall around the house. 
Frankie 
Briguglio got his hand caught in a cement mixer, so AB stopped 
trying to do that kind of work. 
But he did rent a cement mixer to 
build the forno in the backyard, but it outside the wall so it 
would be away from the kids. 
Building the forno: 
AB was thinking of what he could do-with his 
spare time, and thought he would do something that nobody had in 
San Pedro. 
AB had built seven fornos in Italy. 
Built some for 
other people, and one on a piece of land that his father owned. 
Here it's different, AB doesn't know what to call the materials 
that he needed to build the forno. 
Compares it to the process of 
putting in the marble floor -- one man wanted $3500 to put in the 
floor, just for labor. 
AB built the 
forno 
faster than he thought. 
When he starts 
something, he wants to finish it. 
He'll finish it tomorrow, then 
next week they'll make bread and pizza. 
MB: MB has never baked in a forno, but she bakes bread. 
AB: Bread is different when baked in an electric oven, that's why 
AB wants to make the forno. 
DOUG 2 \ 34 
MB: The bread will be round loaves. 
AB: It's going to be interesting. 
MB: For the first time it will be interesting. 
[A
AB: AB's aunt, his father's sister, is here. 
She's happy, because 
B told her that she'd be the first to make bread. 
MB: [Invites fieldworkers to first firing of forno.] 
r 
/
AB: AB is happy because he's going to have something different. 
A lot of people in San Pedro work in construction -- AB wants to 
be the first one to build a forno, thinks he'll start a trend. 
i 
AB's family used to have a forno upstairs in the house. 
Then they 
remodeled the house and took it down. 
But AB's father kept saying 
that he wanted one -- he loved pizza with onions and anchovies, 
they call it facia del'vecchia -- like a focacia. 
It means 'old 
face.' 
A lot of people like it that way. 
You can also make pizza with the sauce on. 
AB's mother made 
another kind they call 'sfincione.' 
MB: You put the sauce on, and then at the end you add bread crumbs 
with grated cheese and oregano. 
AB: AB likes sfincione better than pizza. 
It's thicker than pizza. 
AB used to love to eat the corners because they were crunchier. 
If you make it too think, all you eat is the dough. 
AB's mother went back to Sicily before his father died. 
They kept 
their house in Sicily. 
They just brought a few clothes with them. 
AB's relatives here told them not to bring much, just to bring 
cheese. 
They brought 130 kilo. 
When AB's father went back, he 
took their winter clothes back with them. 
Winter in Sicily is 
cold. 
When they left Sicily, it was November and cold. 
Talk about taking photographs of forno, going on route in San Pedro 
with AB. 
Talk about Italian-American Club -- on Friday night they have 
family night. AB doesn't like to go to the club because they play 
cards there. 
Talk about Fishermen's Fiesta in September, with booths and a 
parade, rides on the fishing boats. 
MB: MB was born in Italy, came to San Pedro in 1968. 
Attended 
school in San Pedro from third grade to twelfth grade. 
She met AB 
at the store where she worked. 
Neither knew the other was Italian. 
He'd come in and buy cigarettes and point at the cigarettes. 
Then

one day, MB spoke in Italian to a woman with a crying baby, and AB 
came up and said, 
'Here you're Italian and you're making me 
suffer.' 
AB asked her if she was married, and she told him no. 
Then he started coming to the store. 
As soon as she figured out 
why he was coming to the store, 
she wanted to hide. 
She was 
embarrassed. 
AB: AB ate so many chocolates you couldn't believe it. 
Every day 
he went three or four times to the store, just to speak to MB. On 
weekends he'd go up and down to the store. 
TAPE 2 OF 2 
,SIDE B 
l 
MB: MB told AB that she couldn't talk to him at the store. 
He 
asked her how they were going to get together , and she told him she 
didn't know. 
Then a mutual friend said to AB, 
'I want you to meet 
a very nice girl.' 
AB said he didn't want to meet anybody, because 
he already had somebody . The woman told AB that she was going to 
invite the girl to her house. 
AB told the woman that if it was who 
he thought it was, and he saw her car outside, then he'd come in. 
So MB went over there with her mother -- she didn't know she was 
supposed to meet AB . And then the doorbell rang and it was him. 
MB's mother knew, but didn 't know it was AB. 
AB: MB's mother is very traditional and doesn't speak English. 
AB 
was fresh from Italy, so when MB's mother saw him, they talked, and 
that was it. 
When AB lived with his uncle, they would bring girls in. 
MB: They wanted them to be married right away. 
They'd be sitting 
on the couch: 'well, is this one good?' 
AB: On weekends they'd sit in there, and AB's uncle would invite 
people over because they wanted them to get married. 
When AB 
figured out what those women were coming there for, he said, 
'I 
don't want to get married, I didn't come here to get married.' 
AB 
was nineteen years old . AB's uncle brought about ten girls over. 
AB told him that he wanted to look for himself. 
So they finally 
quit. 
After the girls would leave, AB's uncle would ask, 'Did you 
like her? 
If you like her, we'll talk.' 
Finally, after two months , AB and MB got engaged. 
MB: He had to come to the house and propose, the old-fashioned way. 
AB and MB got married on March 18th by a Justice of the Peace, 
because AB was not here legally . But they wanted to get married 
in a church, so they each stayed with their own parents -- until 
the night they got married, they still had a chaperone. 
Everywhere 
they went, MB's mother or sister had to come with them. 
They 
DOUG 2 \ 36 
couldn't even go to the movies. 
They went one time, and when they 
came home MB's father started yelling at them. 
AB: It was good for AB, he saved money. 
One time he ordered five 
or six pizzas and his MB's father started yelling that they could 
make pizza at home. 
AB said, 'Don't worry, I'm not going to do it 
any more, I'll save money.' 
He just brought flowers to MB, sat on 
the couch and watched television. 
MB: 
Up till the night they got married in church, 
they had a 
chaperone. 
They were married at Mary Star of the Sea Church. 
The 
old-fashioned people think that way, but the new-fashioned people, 
they don't care. 
AB: AB told his in -laws that things were different now. 
They said 
they didn't care, that's they way they were. 
MB: They married them all that way 
there are eight kids in MB's 
family. 
AB: Everything is changed now, except for them -- _they're hard like 
rocks. — 
MB: MB wants her kids to have some freedom. 
She couldn't go out 
-- even when she went to work. 
MB started work when she was nine 
years old, didn't speak any English. 
When she was working, they'd 
check up on her, call the store. 
MB doesn't want to do that with 
her kids. 
There's a limit. 
AB: When AB picked MB up at the store, MB's sister had to come with 
him. 
AB didn't have a driver's license, he walked to the store to 
pick her up, and MB's sister had to come with him. 
He would stay 
at her home with her for about ten minutes, then he had to go to 
work -- he was working nights. 
Sometimes he would fall asleep on 
the couch, and hardly see her. 
This was .when AB was working for 
his relatives, he worked from ten o'clock to one in the morning. 
When AB came home, MB was going to work. 
MB: That's the way it was the first year AB and MB were married. 
Sometimes they'd see each other ten minutes -- hey, no arguments. 
AB: It was bad, the first year. 
MB: MB's family was from Terasini in Sicily. 
AB: It was about three or four miles from AB's town. 
There are a 
lot of people from Terasini in San Pedro, none from AB's town, only 
one or two. 
People from AB's town went to Detroit. 
A few from 
Terasini went to Detroit, but most came here because they are 
fishermen. 
In AB's town they aren't fishermen, it's about three 
or four miles from the beach. 
Terasini is right on the beach. 
DOUG 2 \ 37 
MB: MB's mother had eight kids, and she always wanted to come to 
America because MB's aunt was in San Pedro and she would sent them 
big packages with clothes. 
Her aunt told her that people just 
threw out their clothes here -- so MB's mother always wanted to 
come here. 
It took MB's aunt thirteen years to get them here. 
Now, 
if you send for someone over there, they come right away. 
MB's father didn't want to come here, but her mother did. 
She had 
to get up at five o'clock in the morning to get them all dressed 
and sent them to school, had to wash everything by hand, had no 
washer or television. 
MB's aunt always told her that there were 
washing machines here. 
They could have bought it over there, but 
MB's mother's mind was that she wanted to come to the U.S., and she 
didn't want to buy anything that she'd have to give away. 
MB's 
mother is happy here, but MB's father isn't--he'd like to go back. 
He was a fisherman. 
He retired about five years ago. 
AB: The poor old man, AB agrees with him, he doesn't do anything 
here. 
He just goes around the house. 
MB: They would go down to the wharf, there were no cars over there, 
everybody would walk. 
Here you have to depend on a car. 
He 
doesn't drive, he's got to depend on the kids -- one says, 
'I'll 
be there in ten minutes,' and doesn't show up till three hours from 
now. 
By that time he's restless and doesn't want to go. 
AB: In the old country there was the English. 
Here he doesn't 
speak English. 
He stays around the house. 
MB: If he drove he would drive himself down to the wharf, and then 
come home when he wants. 
And then he doesn't like to socialize 
with other people. 
He's always been close to himself. 
He doesn't 
like talking with people because they start talking about someone's 
daughter, or someone's wife. 
We don't like that -- nobody looks 
at their back when they're talking about someone else. 
AB: AB's the same way, that's why he doesn't want to join the club. 
A lot of Italian people, they talk about somebody else's wife, 
somebody else's kids. 
We've got a wife, too, we've got kids. 
AB 
doesn't like that. 
Why don't you do your own business. 
AB can't 
fight every moment, that's why he wants to stay home and not bother 
those people. 
That's the way Italian people are, jealous. 
If you 
buy a car -- 
NC1c,HtC3,1 6  
MB: They say, 'you didn't buy it because you had money -- you were 
dealing with cocaine,' or something. 
They're very evil, that's the 
way they think. 
i 
AB: If you buy a car, like if you want to buy a BMW, a fancy car, 
a Mercedes? 
Oh, if you buy a BMW, I'm going to buy a Ferrari.' 
If they buy a Ferrari, they want to buy an airplane. 
They want to 
be bigger than you. 
Sometimes they can't do it, but they force 
DOUG 2 \ 38 
themselves to, because they want to show off. 
If you can't do it,•, 
don't do it. 
MB: The better-off people don't help others, they're very selfish 
people. 
AB: 
They're jealous. 
AB isn't jealous of somebody else. 
If 
somebody else buys a car, AB isn't jealous of them, it means they 
can do it. 
If AB can't do it, he doesn't do it. 
In this country, 
AB is living better than he was in the old country, so he doesn't 
care if a guy buys a Mercedes or an airplane, AB is living better 
than he was in the old country, he has kids and a family, so he 
doesn't care what they do. 
If somebody says something to AB, he's 
going to tell them what he has on his mind. 
Because everybody 
comes from the old country. Everybody comes here poor, like AB was 
when he was there. 
Those people are stupid. 
You have to see what 
you've got inside. 
MB: That's the way some of the Italian people are. 
Sometimes they 
don't 
have 
money 
to 
buy 
food, 
but 
if 
they 
want 
something 
extravagant, they go out of their way. 
AB: Whatever AB has for himself, that's enough. 
Whatever AB can do for his children he will. 
They don't have to 
be big shots. 
MB: MB wants her kids to have something better than her. 
They put 
money aside for the kids every month. 
That way, when they start, 
they can have something to start with. 
MB wants her kids to have 
the best, better than what we had. 
We started with nothing. 
AB: AB's parents gave him nothing. 
MB: We have worked six days a week, every day. 
MB is home now 
because she's on disability, but she has worked all weekends, all 
holidays, on New Years Eve, because at a grocery you can't say, 'I 
want this schedule.' 
'Here's the door.' 
MB has worked for this 
company since 1969. 
MB doesn't want her kids to be like us, she wants them to have 
something. 
If they want to go to college at eighteen, they're 
going to help them. 
MB isn't going to be like her parents and 
say, 
'no, 
you're not going to college, it's going to be out of 
town, blah, blah, blab.' 
None of MB's brothers or sisters went to college. 
The only one 
that did anything wrong was MB's little sister. 
They all got 
married. 
MB's brother got married October 23rd -- November 1st 
she took off. 
She ran off with an older guy. 
She didn't care who 
she ran off with, she didn't want to go through the same thing that 
MB's sisters had gone, have a chaperone , be checked on. 
They 
i 
DOUG 2 \ 39 
didn't hear from her for three years. 
They knew who she had ru 
off with, they didn't know where she had gone. 
Everyone else had 
a chaperone and were married in church. 
MB's sister was eighteen 
when she ran off. 
She was five when they came from Italy. 
She was 
closer to MB's parents than any of them. 
If she wanted a car, she 
got a brand, new car. 
Nobody else got a car but MB and her oldest 
brother. 
Everybody else, whatever they had they worked for it. 
One of MB's brothers still doesn't drive, and he's forty-three. 
MB's youngest sister has settled down, has gotten married and has 
a son. She lived with the guy, but they were separated after two 
months. 
It's not like they were married -- just to get out of the 
house. 
Not too many Italian people do that any more, because when 
they do it ends up just like MB's family did, the younger one runs 
away because they don't want to put up with what the other brothers 
and sister have gone through. 
MB wants to give her children 
freedom, not a hundred percent, but she's not going to say, 
'you, 
can't go to the show with your friend, I have to come with you. 
You have to give them some freedom. 
AB: When AB was working for the Gallettis, he was working for 
nothing. 
Then when MB was pregnant with Frankie, AB asked them to 
put him in the union so he could have some insurance for the 
hospital, and he didn't have enough money. He told AB, 'right now 
you work, and then we'll figure it out later on.' 
AB told them, 
'later on, my wife is ready now.' 
MB: They said, 
'you have the baby, and after you have the baby, 
we'll see.' 
AB: AB couldn't take it anymore. 
One day he fought with his 
cousin, and called up MB to come pick him up. 
He got out of there 
and stayed home for a month-and-a-half, and then went to work for 
the State Fish Company. 
They wanted AB to do everything their way. 
MB: When MB and AB got married, they were telling them where to 
get married, what kind of hall, who was going to be the priest. 
Because they were big shots here, and yet they didn't want to pay 
it all. 
Because AB didn't have any money, MB didn't have any 
money. 
MB could only get married with what she could afford. 
They 
wanted her to.invite four hundred people, she only had 165 people. 
She called MB's mother one night and asked, 'Is my cousin there?' 
When AB got to the house, he called his cousin, and she asked him 
to change the date of the wedding because she was going on a 
cruise. 
She told him that the hall they were getting married, it's 
small and the food's not that great. 
AB told her she could change 
their plans if she paid for it, and she said, no way. 
She didn't 
appreciate that he said that. 
AB: AB said to her, 
'you've got the money. 
If you want to, you 
IJAU"0 
A
T, Ir, *,01-
DOUG 2 \ 40 
can bring people from Italy.' 
AB couldn't pay for it because he 
didn't have the money. 
MB: She wanted the Hilton Hotel. 
AB: AB told her, 
if you pay for it, I'll go.' 
Then she had to go 
on vacation and asked them to change the date. 
She had to change 
the time of her vacation, and she told AB that she had already lost 
$600. 
He said, 
'what's $600 to you? 
For you it's nothing.' 
AB 
told her they couldn't change everything now, because it was going 
to take place in two weeks. 
So she didn't come to the wedding. 
Everybody else was there. 
AB can't do whatever they want.

TAPE 1 OF 1 
SIDE A 
Tony Marabella (TM): Today they're tying up the grapes to get them 
off the ground. 
All these vineyards were planted in the twenties, none of these 
vineyards have been planted in years. 
There used to be vineyards 
everywhere, up to the mountains. 
Not any more. 
TM has been 
farming for only ten years, before that he bought his grapes. 
These are Zinfandel grapes. 
Those are Mission grapes. 
Those were 
the first grapes here, those and Zinfandel. 
Mission grapes have 
thick skins, 
Zinfandel are more delicate. 
All these are old 
grapes, from back in the twenties. 
An old man named Mossi (sp?) used to own all these vineyards. 
He 
owned all of this, even on the other side of the winery. 
The 
original winery was those old shacks (pointing), then he built the 
one near the road. 
Now it's used as a bar. 
There's hardly any 
wineries here any more. 
There's one that makes vinegar. 
There's 
only two small wineries in this whole valley. 
Mossi made his own wine and sold it under his own label. 
The Guasti vineyards were farther down. 
He owned a lot of land. 
DOUG 2 \ 41 
Route 10 demolished the old Brookside Winery, that was Guasti. 
It 
was an old winery, Guasti built it himself, and then Brookside took 
it over. 
It was beautiful. 
TM bought some of the tanks from it. 
The oval tank in front of TM's building is from Brookside. 
This has been an exceptionally abundant year for grapes, 
even 
though there's been a drought. 
There was very little rain, but it 
must have rained at the right time, because it made a bumper crop 
of these varieties. 
Some varieties didn't make very good. 
Usually 
TM doesn't irrigate, but he irrigated these because of the drought. 
You can dry farm here without irrigating. 
[Digs down about eight 
inches to show the moisture.] 
This sand holds the moisture. 
The 
vines' roots go down fifty feet to the water table. 
Usually TM runs a tractor between the rows to keep them clean. 
This year he irrigated too late, and then after he irrigated it 
was too late to run a tractor through because it would do too much 
damage. 
If you touch the grapes with a tractor, they rot. 
So 
rather than lose the grapes, TM has just let the weeds come up. 
TM will pick the grapes in two or three weeks. 
You can lose a ton 
of grapes in one row with the tractor -- that's too much, so TM 
just lets the weeds grow up. 
TM tests the grapes' sugar content to know when to pick them. 
The 
ideal is 24 percent sugar. 
TM will probably sell some of these 
grapes to a winery up north that makes White Zinfandel -- has too 
many grapes for his winery. 
They want theirs about 16 to make 
White Zinfandel, so they'll start picking those early. 
For San 
Pedro, they want 24, so they have to wait a little later. 
To make 
White Zinfandel you want a low sugar, high acid grape. 
They don't 
have much color in them. 
If you leave them in the sun, they get 
real dark, the sun burns them and then the juice becomes red. 
They 
want the wines on the light side so they don't have to bleach them, 
so they pick them early. 
TM doesn't make any White Zinfandel. 
Now Gallo has come out with 
White Grenache -- that's going to be a popular wine. 
The 24 percent sugar content makes a 12 percent wine. 
That's when 
the grapes are ideal, 
that's when the acid and sugar are just 
right. 
If the sugar goes higher, the acid drops down and you have 
to add acid to balance out. 
24 is ideal. 
It's the most perfect 
grape. 
If you crush it and press it right away, it becomes a white 
wine. 
If you ferment it on the skins it picks up color from the 
skins, becomes a burgundy. 
Same grape. 
These grapes are late. 
TM can pick them in November, 
up to 
Christmas sometimes if it doesn't rain. 
The sugar content will be 
26, 27, 28 percent. 
For homemade wine, the higher sugar you have, 
the better it will stay. 
A lot of people don't have cellars. 
Like 
Andy [Briguglio] doesn't have a cellar, he's got a garage, it gets 
pretty hot. 
So if the alcohol isn't up high enough, if it doesn't 
DOUG 2 \ 42 
have high sugar and make high alcohol, 
it won't preserve. 
It 
depends on where you keep it. 
These grapes here [Mission] have real thick skins. 
It can rain on 
those two or three inches, and it doesn't bother them. 
Because 
they're loose bunches and they'll dry out. 
These here [Zinfandel] 
have tight bunches, and if it rains, the water gets inside there 
and it can't dry out and gets rotten. 
Nobody plants new vines any more. 
It's just a matter of time 
there won't be any more grapes here in four or five years [because 
of land development.] 
TM also has grapes down in Mira Loma. 
He 
leases the land. 
He has white and Mission, some Latarra (sp?) and 
some Zinfandel there. 
Has some Latarra here, too, about thirty 
acres on the other side of the road, and about fifteen over here 
on the other side of the wash. 
TM comes out here starting the first of the year for two or three 
days a week. 
And then he's got these fellows [Isidro Guerra and 
Gustine Garcia] working. 
At that time of year they do pruning, 
tractor work, dusting. 
TM used to come out five days a week, but 
as he got older, the freeway bothered him, fighting the traffic. 
The pollution from the freeway affects the grapes: the leaves turn 
yellow and the grapes don't breath. 
The bunches are smaller. 
Years ago, the old timers said the bunches used to like that [10-12 
inches in diameter]. 
But the vines are getting older now, too. 
Now the bunches are 4-5 inches in diameter. 
Points out white grapes, Bergers 
(?), 
that they make champagne 
from. 
The old timers mixed everything up. 
This was all Zinfandel, but 
as the plants died, they had cuttings from other plants, but they 
didn't know what they were, so they went ahead and planted them. 
They mixed them up. 
In those days, grapes were grapes, who cared 
what they were. 
In years back, 
they did a lot of shipping grapes out of this 
valley. 
Years ago the grapes all went back east. 
Now they've all 
moved up north because there's more water available up north, 
that's where you can farm. 
The first grapes that were planted in 
California started here. 
They couldn't make wine during prohibition. 
[John Williams reviews 
history.] 
Guasti sold out, TM remembers he had a son and a daughter, and they 
weren't interested in the winery, so he sold to Brookside. 
After pruning, they irrigate. TM finished irrigating three weeks 
DOUG 2 \ 43 
ago. 
You don't want to irrigate now because the bunches will get 
wet and run. 
You can irrigate when the bunches are still green, 
but not now. 
TM has two men who work for him year-round. 
Isidro Guerra has been 
working for TM for five years. 
He drives the truck with grapes to 
San Pedro. 
They harvest two ways -- for San Pedro and for the wineries. 
TM 
has two dump trucks -- they pick a dump truck and send it up north. 
Then they wait for the sugar to come up and pick for San Pedro. 
The wineries send a semi down to collect the grapes. 
You can put 
twenty tons in a semi. 
They pick particular fields for the wineries. 
This field goes to 
the wineries. 
Better grapes don't have a heavy crop. 
TM wouldn't 
take these to San Pedro because he wants a better crop. 
If though 
they look beautiful, the quality's not there because the crop's too 
heavy. 
All these will go to wineries, 
except for some white 
grape's that TM is saving for San Pedro. 
Which fields go the 
wineries changes from year to year, 
it depends on the crop. TM 
sells to whatever winery is in the market. 
TM thinks white zinfandel is going to fade away. 
The last two 
years there was a real demand, this year the price dropped down on 
them. 
They were selling too much of that. 
It was a fad. 
Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon are still good. 
The White 
Grenache may be good, Gallo is pushing that. 
They didn't grow the older Italian grapes like Grignolino and 
Barbera in this valley. 
Talk about wineries in Temecula. 
They had twenty-seven workers picking grapes last-year. 
They just\ 
come -- they know when it's picking time. 
They have their own 
places to stay, they may stay with a friend. 
They're all Hispanic. 
If it wasn't for them there wouldn't be any grapes around -- no one 
else wants to work. 
The men who work full-time for TM have been 
here a long time. 
Isidro Guerra pretty much runs every thing. 
He 
married a girl here. 
He was working for one of the other farmers 
and then started working for TM. 
TM's sons don't get involved with this part of the operation. 
It's 
not a prosperous business. 
TM's sons think he's nuts. 
One son 
told TM the other day, 'Why are you doing this, you don't have to - 
•,s• 
work that hard.' 
Young kids don't believe in working. 
But 
•C{ 
somebody's 
of to do it -- if the 
didn't 
' 
y 
g 
y 
you wouldn't eat. 
You 
see a lot of satisfaction when you grow things, TM does. 
All you 
have to do is help the vine along, and it grows by itself. 
God 
just puts it there for you. 
DOUG 2 \ 44 
TM has a brother who has a purse seiner in San Pedro. 
TM said to 
him, 
'God, 
if I could catch grapes like you catch fish -- God 
raises the fish for you, if you catch them they're yours.' 
You 
can't do that with grapes, you have to sit there and baby these 
vines all year round to make a crop. 
But fishing, God raises them 
for you, you don't have to feed them or anything. 
So you can't 
help but make money. 
John Williams: 
If you find the fish. 
You can't lose the grapes. 
TM: 
You can lose the grapes , yeah, you can lose the grapes. 
TM 
lost a whole crop one year, it rained about this time of year, a 
little later, and all the grapes turned rotten, just turned to 
vinegar. 
TM had to find grapes somewhere else up north. 
You have 
to supply the customers, or you lose them. 
TM has about 250 customers who regularly make wine. 
TM never buys juice, he does all the pressing.. 
People that make 
wine from TM, it's all custom wines. 
There might be two or three 
grapes in one wine, to get flavor. 
They mix white and red grapes 
together. 
When you mix grapes you have better wines, more flavor. 
It's all custom wines -- people say what they want, and TM makes 
it. 
TM's operation is pretty much unique now. 
There used to be a few 
other in San Pedro. 
Most of them bought their grapes. 
TM's uncle 
had his own vineyards, not the same land TM is working now. 
He was 
•• 
C 
also leasing. 
He owned a lot of property in Riverside, but its 
wasn't farm land. 
V•L`StN X55 
TM leases all his land, works on a percentage of the crop. 
That 7 
•, 
way, if you lose the whole crop, you don't have to pay. 
TM keeps 
track -- he picks the grapes and weighs them. 
J 
TM thinks a vine will stay in production indefinitely as long as 
you keep pruning it. 
You can't judge how old a vine is by the 
thickness of the trunk, some grow faster than others. 
You don't just let anybody prune. 
If they don't prune right, 
they'll take the fruit right off, and you won't have a crop. 
You 
can prune, and determine what kind of crop you want. 
You don't 
want too much grapes or the vine will suffer. 
You try to keep a 
happy medium every year. 
This year it made a heavy crop by itself, 
but usually it won't. 
You can force a vine like a human being, but 
if you force it every year, it'll die. 
It gets weaker and weaker, 
and eventually dies off. 
If varies on how much work you put into 
it. 
If you put water and fertilizer, you can prune to get a 
heavier crop. 
It becomes a healthier vine and you can prune 
heavier to bring on more grapes. 
DOUG 2 \ 45 
TM learned to prune by watching. 
Not from his uncle, he wasn't 
farming when TM was in the business. 
Just learning, and hiring 
these fellows that already knew how. 
There isn't much to it. 
You 
learn which is the fruit wood and which isn't. 
It's real easy. 
[Demonstrates on a vine.] 
TAPE 1 OF 1 
SIDE B 
TM can trust the man who works for him, doesn't have to come out 
and watch him. 
Just leave him here and he prunes the whole thing. 
The vines touching the ground all rot, you have to tie them up. 
It's pretty unusual, you usually don't have to tie it up like this, 
this year the crop's so heavy. 
The vine is not too strong, and 
they lie down on the ground. 
The vines on the other side of the road are staked. 
You can tie 
them and train them. 
One of the reasons for keeping the fruit close in is to bring the 
tractor through. 
One disadvantage of training the vines is that 
you can't weed with a tractor. 
What they have now is a tractor 
with a weed killer. 
Put you couldn't use a weed killer on 
something like this, you'd kill the vine because it's not high 
enough. 
This is easier farming because you don't have to do much 
hand work. 
The tool they use on the tractor comes within six 
inches of the vine. 
When the vines are trained on a wire, you can 
use weed killer, which is probably good, because you still have to 
shovel here. 
The tool doesn't get any closer. 
You have to shovel 
the vines for San Pedro, otherwise when they pickers put the box 
down, the weeds get in and it doesn't look good. 
For they wineries 
they don't have to shovel. 
If you want the grapes to look good, 
you shovel all around the vines to get the grass out. 
[Shows damage that rabbits and squirrels have done.] 
They kill 
the roots. 
They dig holes down and start sucking on the roots when 
there's no more moisture left. 
It's a big problem, you have to 
keep after them all the time. 
It's the squirrels that do this. 
TM uses commercial fertilizer, sulfate ammonia. 
You dig it in the 
ground, every other row. 
All this land is for sale, it's all going to be developed. 
There' 
was nothing here a few years ago. 
You can see the houses along 
the foothills, TM used to farm up there, hated to go through with 
his tractor because of the rocks. 
He said, 
'they'll never put 
homes up here.' 
And they've got beautiful homes, too. 
You do have frost down here. 
TM lost some grapes this year. 
Down 
DOUG 2 \ 46 
toward Mira Loma you get frost quite a bit around April. 
The low 
spots get hit by the frost. 
This is all commercial land in here, the houses are all across the 
road. 
TM will retire when they develop this land, or go up north to get 
grapes, or to Temecula. 
Temecula is a new area where they're 
planting. 
So is an area near Monterey. 
TM was in Salinas in the 
(yaC, 
army, and doesn't know how they grow grapes around there, sometimes 
you go for days without seeing the sun. 
As long as TM can grow enough grapes for himself, he doesn't care. 
TM only sells fresh juice, without the skins in it. 
With rose, 
you just crush it and press it. 
With the reds you leave it in the 
skins for a day or two. 
Or you can use really dark grapes that 
have juice like ink. 
You mix that with the grapes and make a red 
wine that way, grapes like aligante- (sp?). 
TM destems when he crushes the grapes, has a(big crusher/ stemmer,•- RQ-z 1•• 
People that buy grapes use stems in their wines. 
Years ago, 
L Ura 
everybody used stems 
in their wines, 
and TM has tasted some 
delicious wines. 
TM throws the residue from pressing away. 
Too much labor to bring 
it back to the vineyard for fertilizing. 
This winery over here has 
a distillery for the residue to make brandy to fortify their wines. 
Years ago, they used to make chicken feed from the pulp. 
Haul it 
to L.A. and mix it with the feed. 
You can feed the cows with it, 
they love it. 
There used to be a dairy on Western Avenue [in San 
Pedro), and years ago, TM used to haul the pulp up there, and he 
used to feed the dry cows that weren't giving any milk. 
Then he 
started giving 
it 
to the milk cows, 
and he 
started getting 
complaints on the milk, cause it tasted like wine. 
So he cut that 
out. 
Talk about making vinegar. 
Description of process at Regina 
Vinegar Company across the road. 
TM doesn't use any particular 
\ImE6,1•? 
grapes for vinegar. 
TM doesn't use the electric pump in the field for irrigating any 
more, because the electric company charges a 
monthly fee regardless 
of whether you use it. 
It's cheaper to get the water out of a fire 
hydrant and pay for it by the cubic foot. 
TM owns his own 
irrigation equipment, stores it in Mira Loma. 
All the pipes are 
on a trailer. 
[Doug DeNatale transfers tape recorder to John Williams.] 
Talk about raising grapes on the East Coast. 
[Wind noise.] 
DOUG 2 \ 47 
Drive to label wines doesn't bother TM. 
Most of the people who buy from TM are home wine makers. 
They make 
wine because they're allergic to sulfites. 
If you keep the wine 
cool, you don't need the sulfites. 
TM likes to put sulfites in to 
protect himself. 
[Breakup of sound from wind throughout here.] 
With some wines, you can smell the sulfites on the cork. 
It takes a week to tie up this one field. 
END OF INTERVIEW 
TIAW-DD-A010=Interview with John Royal, San Pedro, CA 
July 25, 1989 
Doug DeNatale, interviewer 
Recorded with Marantz PMD-430, Sennheiser cardiod microphones in 
coincident tip configuration. 
TAPE 1 OF 2 
SIDE A 
Introduction 
John Royal (JR): 
When JR's father came over from the old country, 
his name was Achille Reale. 
JR's uncles finally convinced him to 
Americanize his name, and told him that literal translation would 
be Archie Royal. 
He had trouble with that over the years, but JR 
grew up with the name of Royal instead of Reale. 
JR's father came 
from the province of Regio Mila (sp?) , from a small town called 
Valbona (sp?). 
It's way up in the mountains above Genoa. 
His 
father was a stonemason, and Archie Royal worked for his father as 
a sheepherder. 
Then he ran away and went down to work in the 
marble quarries in Carrara. 
His father didn't like that. 
So, 
Archie Royal had a brother working in the coal mines in Pueblo, 
Colorado. 
So his father told him, 'if you don't want to stay here, 
you better go to America and find your brother.' 
So he landed in 
Pueblo, Colorado in 1913 and found his brother. 
And then a few 
years later, his brother married and went back to Italy, and never 
returned, so JR's father became the only member of the family that 
stayed in this country. 
JR doesn't know how the brother came to Pueblo, Colorado. 
He had 
been there for seven or eight years, he was older than JR's father. 
In those days, they came over to work and send money home to the 
family and help. 
If it wasn't for the fact that he had a brother 
in Pueblo, Colorado, he probably never would have come over. 
His 
father suggested to him that if he wasn't happy he better go to 
DOUG 2 \ 48 
America and find his brother. 
JR's father told him that when he came through Ellis Island, they 
came through and sold him a sack of food for a dollar that had 
apples, oranges, bread, and salami, and he lived off of that for, 
three days on the train going from New York to Pueblo. 
He landed N 
in Pueblo on July 4th, 
and that was always important to him, 
because that was a celebration day. 
rnMtgP_. 
In Carrara, JR's father's job was to scale the cliffs on a rope 
and knock down the loose chips so they wouldn't fall down and kill 
the workers. 
They had to communicate with him by flags, and heal 
swing from one cliff to another on the ledges. 
And his father, 
found him down there the next spring, what he was doing, and his 
father fainted, he said, 
'My God, you're going to kill yourself.' 
And JR's father said he didn't want to go back up in the mountains) 
and freeze in the wintertime and herd sheep. 
So his old man told,, 
him to go to America and find his brother. 
J 
Things were very bad in Colorado. 
Most of the.men were bachelors_ 
and they lived in tents and makeshift huts. 
They worked for the 
company and got paid in company scrip and you had to shop at the 
company store. 
It was like slave-labor conditions. 
As he got more 
and more 
active 
in 
the coal 
mines, 
they tried to 
form the 
mineworkers' union. 
They had a big strike and practically ended 
up in a civil war for eighteen months around Pueblo and Trinidad, 
Colorado. 
It was called the Ludlow_ Massacre. He went through that 
whole thing. 
That's where they burned down the company camp and 7 
uNior► 
killed thirteen women and kids, and all that. 
So he went through 
LA F4 2 
that whole era, and it was a very, very bad time. 
They had the 
militia, the Pinkertons, the sheriff, the guards on them. 
And in 
a lot of cases they just shot them on sight. 
There were lynchings, 
and dragging people through town with a rope behind a horse. 
It 
was a real bad time. 
JR read as he got older and was going to 
Washington, DC, that it's written up in the Congressional Record 
as some of the darkest days in American labor. 
He went through 
that whole thing as a young man and worked in the coal mines. 
And 
later, in 1928, they moved to California. 
He talked about it rather extensively. 
Until the day he died he 
hated any star or symbol that gave recognition of authority such 
as a sheriff, a ranger, or a Pinkerton, because he had such brutal 
,off 
memories of them. 
He respected the law, but he, he told where 
0t 
these miners were forced literally in self-defense, 
they were 
forced up into the hills, and out of desparation they'd come down 
at night and they' d break into stores and things and steal blankets 
and food to survive with. 
And they were fighting the scabs and 
militia, 
and they were involved in stuff like sabotaging coal 
mines, coal cars. 
It was basically like a war. 
R has a book by the son of the doctor who used to crawl under the 
••` `barb wire fences and searchlights to administer to the women and 
DOUG 2 \ 49 
kids, under the cover of darkness. 
And his son wrote a book 
called, 
,rQP. !y. 
OutA
f  
o Th- 
Depths. 
Even if you weren't for labor, that 
book would make your blood boil to read the atrocities that took 
place 
there. 
JR's 
father 
told 
him 
that 
he 
experienced 
discrimination as a kid. 
He'd be standing in front of a th eater , 
looking at pictures of Charlie Chaplin, cause he couldn't read or 
write English, and he'd be standing there on the outside looking 
at the show, minding his own business, thinking whether to go in 
or not, and people would attack him and beat him up because he was 
a foreigner. 
That was just part of the whole thing. 
JR guesses 
every ethnic group had its turn in the barrel like this, there was 
a lot of Czechoslovakians and Irish and Polacks that worked in the 
mines at that time, but they exploited these people to no end. 
As a result of that strike they went on to get better conditions 
eventually. 
JR's father worked in several mines. 
One was the Victor Mining 
and Fuel Company. 
At that time they worked in the minefields all 
over. 
There were some down in Arizona and Utah, and then the 
southern minefields of Colorado. 
They'd go where mines were 
hiring. 
JR's father told him that at that time they'd hold back thirty days 
of your pay -- it was nothing anyhow, it was less than a dollar a 
day, and they'd hold that over your head so you wouldn't quit and 
leave. 
It was probably a very controlled situation. 
When JR was a kid about six years old, his father had a homestead 
out at Mount Harris, Colorado, in Wolf Creek Canyon, and they came 
up one night, the Ku-Klux -Klan,- and they built a big, wooden cros s 
up on the rimrock behind the farm there, and they sent word down 
that they weren't going to tolerate any Eye-talian  
people and/or 
Catholics in the area, and that they were going to burn that out. 
If JR remembers correctly, the old man got the rifle and probably 
threw a lot of shots up there and chased them off. 
He said he knew 
who they were, most of them were business people and merchants in 
the little town there. 
But he lived with that kind of stuff all 
those years. 
Any one who was a foreigner or a Catholic, in this 
case an Italian, they didn't want them around, they discriminated 
against 
them, 
they 
abused 
them, 
they 
prosecuted 
them, 
they 
exploited them. 
So it was very, very rough in those days for these 
type 
of 
people 
to 
survive. 
And you 
couldn't 
look 
to 
the 
authorities, because if the truth was known, probably some of them 
were involved in the Ku Klux Klan themselves. 
But he became very 
militant for unions. 
And he was a big man, strong man, and he was 
looked up to by most of the Italians in the mines at that time, 
because he was large _in stature. 
They nicknamed him "Jumbo," 
`because 
he"had put 
the largest single piece of coal in a coal car 
that had ever been done. 
Because of his phenomenal strength and 
what he had done, they kidded him and nicknamed him "Jumbo." 
Until 
the day he died, if you asked anyone on the waterfront here if they•

knew Archie Royal, and they wouldn't know who in the hell Archie 
Royal was, but if you asked them for Jumbo, right away they knew 
who Jumbo was. 
He became•a totally dedicated man of labor. 
He wasn't able to read 
or write, but what he lacked there he sure in the hell made up for 
it on the picket line, and in supporting the union 's activities to 
organize the working people and help them get a bigger piece of 
bread. 
It was 1913 when he landed in Pueblo . The massacre was around 1917 
or 1919. 
He was right in the union from the beginning. 
The 
governor finally had to step in and put a stop to it because it 
got totally out of hand. 
JR's father homesteaded after he married . Her family lived around 
Mount Harris . At that time you could homestead a hundred-and-sixty 
acres of land. 
So he'd try to homestead this land , 
and then they'd 
work in the coal mines . And then when the coal mines closed down, 
he' d try to work the land, or simultaneously , 
. 
but it was tough, 
because wages were very bad and conditions were bad, and he tried 
that for a few years , and then after that he decided there was a 
better way to go. 
If the truth were known, he probably had to 
leave Colorado because he got blackballed for his union activities 
in a lot of ways, so they had the law on him all the time, they 
were always after him . So he finally came to California. 
He was headed for Canada, but JR's mother had a sister who lived 
in Wilmington, and so she said, 
'let's stop and visit with her.' 
The family landed in Wilmington on Christmas Eve of 1928, JR's 
father, mother, three sisters , 
and himself . JR was six years old, 
he was born in Colorado. 
They stuck around for a few days, then 
JR's father got a job, they were building the Don (?) Hotel in 
Wilmington , 
and he got a job doing something on the breakwater down 
here , and then he got a job working on the waterfront. 
-JR's uncle 
convinced him to stay here instead of going to Canada. 
In 1933 and 1934, he got involved in another big strike when they 
formed the International Longshoremen and Warehousemen's Union 
under Harry Bridges. 
And he even went to jail over a big fight 
they had down at the waterfront at that time. 
But it didn't last 
that long. 
And he saw the birth of the International Longshemen 
and Warehousmen 's Union, and all the abuses they had for all those 
years up to them . And they saw all this change and come about for 
the better , and subsequently went to retire in the sixties with a 
pension from the Longshoremen 's Union, and had the satisfaction of 
knowing that he had probably done some good for the guys on the 
waterfront as well as the guys to follow. 
JR was born June 24, 1922. 
His grandmother and aunt were midwives, 
not only for himself but for all his sisters up in that homestead. 
They had no record of their birth. 
When World War II came on, JR 
J" -)N 
r 
vw•o• 
DOUG 2 \ 51 
signed up for the military, and they had no record . He had to go 
back to Colorado and find people who knew his parents at the time, 
and they had to sign affidavits that they knew his mother had given 
birth to him and his sisters . JR found out that when he was two 
years old they had taken him to Steamboat Springs and had him 
baptized in the Catholic church. 
But when they got the baptismal 
certificate , instead of being John Joseph Royal, it was Giovanni 
Giuseppe Reale. 
So he had to prove he was born, he finally proved 
to the government that he was born. 
Then finally, in 1940, JR went 
to a law firm in San Pedro , 
and had the name officially changed for 
the whole family, because it had never been changed officially. 
By then, JR and his sisters had all gone through school by the name 
of Royal, his social security number, everything was under Royal. 
Looking back , JR wishes it had never happened , because he'd much 
rather grown up under the name of "Johnnie Reale" rather than 
"Johnny Royal ," because everybody keeps telling him that the name 
implies that he's English, 
and he has to explain that he's a 
paisan, and go through the whole thing. 
In those days, there 
weren't doctors in the Rocky Mountains, unless you went miles and 
miles. 
When the Longshoremen 's Union was organized , JR was eleven years 
old. He was going to Barton Hill School, and came home from school 
one afternoon at three or four o'clock , and his old man had a wine 
cellar under the house , 
and JR went down in the cellar, and he was 
there with a bunch of guys, and they were having a meeting and 
making weapons and things like that, homemade blackjacks and billy 
clubs, and stuff. 
The steamship companies and the employers had 
built what they call a bullpen over here at 145 and Wilmington, and 
they brought in a lot of scabs by truck and rail, and they had them 
living in there, and they had Chinese cooks, and they had tents, 
and 
these 
guys 
were 
doing 
the 
longshoremen's 
work 
on 
the 
waterfront . It got real nasty . They brought the police in and it 
got real bad. 
It was sort of a repeat of what the old man had gone 
through in Colorado . This one night they decided that they had 
enough, so they all got together and decided that they were going 
to go over and raid that bull pen and knock the hell out of those 
scabs and burn the camp down. 
So they did , they raided the camp 
about midnight , and a kid who lived across the alley from JR's 
family, named Dick Parker , 
he got shot and killed. 
And JR's father 
contended that the detective who was in the bullpen, a guy named 
Hackey , was the one that shot Dick Parker. 
So he and JR's father 
got into it physically . They set fire to the tents and threw a 
lot of the scabs into the bay, and things like that. 
The fire 
department was turning the fire hoses on them , 
and some of the guys 
was 
chopping 
the 
fire 
hoses , other 
guys 
were 
breaking 
the 
searchlights , and all that kind of stuff. 
JR's family lived over 
on Santz Cruz and Mason Streets, and at five o'clock the next 
morning, about four or five big touring cars pulled up at the 
house . JR was sleeping on the cot in the front room, and his 
mother went to open the door, and they just knocked her down and 
came charging in, 
about ten of them came charging through the 
`•RMC 
DOUG 2 \ 52 
house, and went in the bedroom and grabbed the old man who was in 
bed, and they didn't even give him a change to get dressed, he had 
long underwear. 
They just handcuffed him and dragged him out and 
put him in the touring car and away they went. 
It took them a 
couple of days to find out that they had him up in Lincoln Heights 
Jail in Los Angeles. 
JR's father told him at that time that in the 
cell, he didn't talk much about it, but he said they didn't have 
any facilities, they had a hole in the corner that they used as a 
toilet, and they had him shackled to a pad. 
He never did tell JR 
what really happened, but they probably worked him over pretty good 
for a couple of days and nights, and then he finally got out. 
But 
some guy during that strike disappeared and they never did find 
them. 
In the Ludlow Massacre they used to put them in boxcars and run 
them out of town, and a lot of them they took them out in rural 
areas and just killed them. 
But 
he 
stayed 
with 
it, 
and 
they 
eventually 
formed 
the 
Longshoremen's Union on the West Coast and got better working 
conditions. 
When JR was a kid, before they did that, he used to 
sell newspapers at the Navy Landing at the waterfront depot where 
the streetcars come in. 
The Navy was stationed down here, and 
thousands and thousands of sailors would come ashore each day on 
the motor launches. 
Beacon Street was wide open, they had Chinese 
gambling joints downstairs, and gin mills and bars on street level, 
and upstairs was houses of ill repute. 
They'd sell newspapers for 
three cents, and JR would get a half a cent. 
He used to carry a 
shoeshine kit and shine the sailors' shoes. 
And there used to be a little ferry that went across the bay from 
here to Terminal Island, and it took five cents to ride the ferry. 
And JR's mother used to give him five cents and a lunch, and he'd 
go across to Terminal Island and go down to the docks and find what 
ship his dad was working on, because before they had the union; 
once they started a ship they had to stay there, whether it was two 
days and nights, three days and nights, they had to stay. 
If they 
collapsed or couldn't work, they'd never get hired again, because 
they were hired off the dock like animals. 
The chief mate or 
company guy would come down the dock and they'd line these guys up 
and hire them. 
There was no such thing as an eight-hour day, they 
just worked them around the clock. 
If they took too long when they 
went to the toilet, they'd fire them, and it was very, very bad. 
That's why JR's mother used to give him food to bring to his 
father. 
That's where the name longshoreman came from, they used 
to yell, 
'men along the shore,' looking for workers to come work., 
It was pretty bad. 
And they had a blackball system. 
If a guy 
caused trouble, or didn't work hard enough, if they felt he was 
militant, he couldn't get any work. 
It wasn't as bad as the Ludlow 
Massacre, but it was bad enough. 
There was a lot of sympathy for the longshoremen at the time. 
The 
DOUG 2 \ 53 
local merchants helped them out, gave them credit, these little mom 
and pop stores. 
The Japanese-Americans around here who had truck 
farms around here gave them food. 
The formed a couple of soup 
kitchens, they had one up here on Seventh Street. 
And what they'd 
do, 
they would give food to the seamen and the longshoremen, 
because the seamen were involved in the strike with them. 
And they 
would feed the single men in these kitchens, and the married men 
they'd give them some food to bring home for their families. 
There 
was one man named Erikson, had a fish boat, so JR's dad and some 
of these guys went out to Santa Cruz Island, and they used to shoot 
goat and sheep, 
and then they'd clean them and bring twenty, 
thirty, 
forty head of goats and sheep down here. 
And at night 
time, after midnight, they had a little automobile ferry that would 
stop running, so JR's dad had a 1926 Chrysler with an old wooden 
trailer, and JR would go down there with them and they'd back that 
trailer on the ramp and they'd load it with these goats and sheep 
carcasses off the fish boat, and then put a tarpaulin over it and 
take it over here to the soup kitchen. 
And they'd cook for the 
single men there, and the married men, give them a few vegetables 
that were donated and the fishermen donated fish, and they'd give 
them fish and maybe a piece of goat or sheep to take home. JR 
remembers that all very well. 
It was pretty tough. 
JR's father got a pretty good indoctrination in the labor movement 
and the abuses the employers could put upon working people. 
Today, 
one finds it hard to imagine that some of the things that happened 
really happened. 
JR never thought he'd get involved in the labor movement. 
He went 
to sea with the Merchant Marine in World War II, and then when he 
got back he went fishing. 
He was a navigator on a tuna boat here, 
and then fished sardines in the forties out of San Francisco, 
Monterey, Moss Landing, and down here, and then went to Mexico 
fishing tuna. 
Then he joined the Fishermen's Union, and it was 
predominantly a Yugoslav union. 
There were two unions in town. 
One was predominantly Yugoslav and the other was Italian fishermen. 
The Yugoslays were distant-water fishermen. 
Because JR was a 
navigator, he got a job on a Yugoslav boat, and joined the union. 
He attended union meetings, and didn't like some of the abuses that 
were taking place, and started voicing his opinion. 
Little by 
little the members pushed him into office. 
It wasn't his ambition, 
he was looking to get into or buy a fish boat of his own. 
So he 
thought he'd try it for a year, and that was 1957 and they've kept 
him in office ever since. 
There was quite a lot of problems with the et•inic 
gr-Qups_at that' 
time in the fishing industry. 
We ran into the same problem all 
over again where the 
fish canners where just 
like the mine 
companies, they had heavy mortgages on the fish boats, and the boat 
owner owed the cannery a lot of money, and when they'd catch fish 
they'd deduct so much of it for the payment on the boat. 
And the 
crew members were brought over from the old country, and a lot of 
DOUG 2 \ 54 
them had a pretty rough time of it, too. 
So trying to organize 
them into the Fishermen's Union was pretty tough, 
because the 
cannery told the boat owner that if the guys went into the union 
it was going to kill the industry, and that the union was a bunch 
of communists, and that they would have to foreclose on the boat 
and take the boat away from him. 
And his crew and family would 
lose their jobs. 
JR worked for two years trying to get them all 
into the union, 
and then they went before the National Labor 
Relations Board. 
And a day or two before the election, all the 
boat owners were having the crews come up to their houses and 
having barbecues, and telling these guys that they had to vote 
against the union, because if they voted for the union, the cannery 
was going to foreclose, take the boats away from them, and they'd 
lose their jobs. 
They put the fear in them, and they lost by a 
very small margin, 75 votes. 
JR was very disappointed because he 
had put two years of thirty hour days trying to do this. 
In some cases the cannery owned the boat, in some cases half the 
boat, in some cases they had heavy mortgages. 
The cannery pretty 
much dictated the price. 
The fishermen were captive victims. 
If 
two or three fishermen got together and decided they wanted to 
build a boat or buy a boat, they'd go to the cannery and say, 'we 
want to get our own boat,' and the cannery would say, 'okay, we'll 
finance you, or you go to the bank and the bank will give you the 
money but we'll cosign it. ' Then they had a yoke around their neck 
from then on. 
They caught them stealing weight on the scales and robbing them. 
They went to court for years and finally won. 
JR got blackballed 
out of the industry for leading that fight. 
It was a repeat of 
what JR's father told him had happened in the coal mines. 
So JR 
told the men they had to get together, 
and they did and they 
assessed themselves, and put a union man on the scales to watch 
the company men. 
And when they did that, they found the fishing 
boats increased their carrying capacity by anywhere from fifteen 
to twenty-five percent per load. 
So then [the canneries] took them 
to court, including JR, and said they were a bunch of communists 
and it was restraint of trade and collusion. 
And we argued that 
we were right and they were wrong. 
Our lawyers kept saying, 
'if 
this is really hurting you, open up your books.' 
So finally the 
judge said that he was going to give the union ten days to look at 
the books. 
So they went to San Francisco and got an economist, a 
pretty sharp guy named Paul Pinsky, brought him down here. 
There 
was a hundred-and-fifty boats here, 
and in the heyday of the 
sardine fishing, boats would come down from Oregon and Washington, 
and there'd be 
four-hundred-and-fifty boats here, 
and 
it was' 
impossible to check the weights of this whole thing. 
They found 
on the spot checks, they figured that over the years they had 
stolen something like ten million dollars or more of fish. 
So when 
that came out, the canneries all dropped their suits all at once 
against the union, and said that they weren't communists, they were 
good, God-fearing people. 
DOUG 2 \ 55 
TAPE 1 OF 2 
SIDE B 
When the election was over and JR was unsuccessful in forming one 
fishermen's union in San Pedro, he became persona non grata because 
guys would tell him, 
'John, we need two guys on the boat,' and JR 
was a navigator, he could splice wire rope, do everything.' 
He'd 
go to the captain and say, 
'I understand you need two men,' and 
he'd tell JR, 'no.' 
Nobody would hire him. 
The men liked him, but 
the owners were scared to hire him. 
So JR went over and started working as an extra longshoreman, and 
eventually got into the longshoremen's union, and got active in 
the union, got on the executive board. 
Then this union got into 
trouble, got in a big dispute with another union, AFL-CIO, at the 
time, and there were jurisdictional wars. 
So they went to San 
Francisco and talked to Harry Bridges. 
In 1950, the original name 
of this outfit was the International Fishermen and Allied Workers 
Union, they were from here all the way to Alaska. 
And they merged 
in 
1950 
with the 
Longshoremen's Union, 
which gave them more 
strength. 
So they went to San Francisco and talked to Harry 
Bridges and said, 
'we need some more help down here, we're being 
raided by the AFL-CIO, and we've got trouble with the canneries.' 
And they didn't have anybody in the International up there who was 
qualified to give them the assistance, so he told them to look 
around, and they came over and asked JR if he wanted to come back. 
And he told them the things he wanted to do he couldn't do, and he 
was blackballed and it didn't make any sense for him to go back 
now. 
So Bridges came down from Frisco and came to see JR with 
other guys in the union, and they convinced him to go over and try 
to 
help 
the 
fishermen 
out. 
JR worked 
as 
an 
International 
representative for one year, 
and subsequently they put him in 
office, they basically drafted him. 
He thought he'd try it for a 
year and then go back to the Longshoremen, and he never did go 
back. 
Since then, they've got them a pension plan, which they 
never had, a health and welfare plan, which they never had, and 
they got better conditions, and better weights and measures because 
they have a union man on the scales to police the unloading. 
The 
cannery used to say and still does if they don't watch them, that 
the fish was bad fish and wasn't suitable for canning, and they 
refused to pay for it, and then they turned around after the boat 
left and can it anyhow. 
All kinds of tricks. 
In the industry they were doing pretty good, but in the last few 
years the industry's died because all the canners moved overseas. 
The tuna canners moved to American Samoa and Puerto Rico. 
There's 
one tuna cannery left in all of the United States, here on Terminal 
Island -- and the tuna industry started around the turn of the 
century right here in San Pedro. 
DOUG 2 \ 56 
There's two canneries. 
The mackerel cannery used to go by Starkist 
Tuna, which is Heinz. 
The boat owners, and JR was instrumental in 
that 
for 
seven years, 
pushing them, 
and the boat owners got 
together and bought that cannery for 1.6 million dollars. 
Because 
if they didn't buy, it would have been torn down and they would 
have been parking Japanese cars or containers on the dock there. 
They've been in business for two years now. 
JR suggests we talk to Frank Iacona. 
Then Pan-Pacific Fisheries, which recently sold to International 
Protein, a British outfit, cans tuna and mackerel, but mainly tuna. 
And it's the last tuna cannery in the United States. 
JR's house wasn't the center for organizing the longshoremen's 
union, but it was one of them. 
There were a lot of Italians that 
worked on the waterfront at that time, 
and JR's dad became a 
spokesman 
or 
leader, 
because 
of 
his 
militancy, 
among 
that 
particular ethnic group. 
And then at that time there were some 
Mexican-Americans that worked in the lumber yard, and some were 
longshoremen, 
too. 
There different ethnic groups, 
there were 
Finns, and Norwegians, and Swedes. 
Among the Italians, JR's father 
was considered one of the leaders. 
They would come to the house 
and have meetings in the house, and downstairs in the wine cellar, 
and discuss. 
And they did picket duty day and night. 
There was 
always some activity going on -- some was legal and some wasn't, 
but it was a battle of survival. 
They'd find ways of camouflaging their meetings, 
because the 
detectives were always coming around to harass them. 
If they saw 
them in groups they'd bust them up and take them down and throw 
them in jail. 
They'd have meetings in cellars, or they'd meet in 
a park like they were having a picnic or a family gathering. 
But 
the majority of the meeting was under cover. 
They were already 
exposed as being radicals and militants, and the police had all-
their names. 
The police used to follow JR's father in the car, 
even if they were just going to take a ride around town. 
You'd 
get up in the morning and look across the street, and there'd be 
two of them sitting in a touring car over there watching the house. 
They always had you under surveillance. 
And for the slightest 
excuse they pull you over, manufacture some excuse to harass you, 
maybe take you down to jail and give you a hard time, then release 
you. 
During the strike, a lot of the guys were so long on the strike 
that they decided to break ranks. 
And JR and his friends had to' 
stay down here at the ferry building and convince them one way or 
another that they should break ranks and break the strike. 
They 
had some problems there, but they finally did manage to hang on 
and win that strike. 
uMCI,•5

Then when they settled the longshoremen's strike, Bridges refused 
DOUG 2 \ 57 
to go back to work until they settled for the seamen, and the 
seamen never did forget that. 
And as a result the seamen 's union 
got a tremendous shot in the arm. 
They became very good allies. 
The Italians in the old country fished with lampara_ -nets. 
When 
the Yugoslays came, they came across Canada and came down into 
Bellingham, Tacoma, Washington. 
And in 1917, 
18, a lot of the 
Yugoslays came down to San Pedro 
and the 
devel oped 
 
g 
y 
p 
purse seine— • 
fishing. 
And the Italians, who were in a minority at 
the 
mtie, 
they had their own boats and their own fleet, they called them the 
Federated Boat Owners Association, and they fished with lampara 
nets, and later they went to purse seining also. 
They all fished 
on the coast here for sardines and mackerel and squid and stuff 
like that. 
And in the summer months, bluefin tuna would come out 
of Mexico and come up the coast , but the Yugoslays were the first 
to start going down into Mexico with purse seiners, fishing for 
tuna. 
In those days they had ice boats, and ten, twelve men in the 
same foc 'sle, and they used to have to ice the fish by hand, had 
no fresh water, had to take a bath with salt water. 
You had to go 
in every thirty days to some Mexican port and buy vegetables and 
fuel. 
It's strange how the ethnic groups gravitated to the same` 
latitudes that they came from in the old country. 
All of the 
Norwegians, Danes , and Swedes, gravitated to Alaska and Canada ,•sr'N•' 
Seattle, Washington, cold climates. 
The Italians gravitated from 
the east coast into San Francisco , Monterey, and down here and in 
San Diego. 
And then the Portuguese came in from the old country, 
and they were heavy in Massachusetts , and then they came out here 
to San Pedro and then gravitated to San Diego. 
The makeup was 
Scandinavians in the north, and in the sardine days almost totally 
Italian in San Francisco and Monterey . And then in San Pedro it 
eventually got to be about a fifty-fifty mixture of the Italians 
and the Yugoslays . 
San Diego was about seventy-five percent 
Portuguese and twenty-five percent Italian. 
-11 
The Portuguese fished with pole and line. 
They stood at a rack 
and used poles with artificial lures, catch the tuna that way. 
Then in 1957 they found that our purse seiners were making five 
trips a year compared to their two , so they started to convert 
their bait boats over to purse seining. 
And they hired the Italian 
and Yugoslav fishermen of San Pedro to teach them how to use purse 
seiners and how to be mast men, how to spot fish and all that 
there. 
And then when they learned, they no longer needed these 
guys up here, and they went on to built bigger and better purse 
seiners. 
And today, 
the biggest purse seiners cost about 15 
million dollars. 
At that time the boats here were probably 50, 75" 
ton boats. 
And they they started building 200, 
then 500, 
700 
tonners in San Diego.

Then the guy who invented the power block, Mario Purteic 
DOUG 2 \ 58 
(sp?), JR knew him and fished with him. 
He invented the  power 
block , instead of fifteen guys on the rail pulling the net and--\ 
-brae k ing their backs. 
He used to cuss like hell and say, 'there's 
got to be a better way than breaking your back,' and he developed 
the power block, which is used all over the world. 
He's still 
alive -- JR saw him up in Seattle two or three years ago. 
JR 
fished with him before he invented the power block. 
He had good 
hands, he was a good rigger , and he had a lot of good ideas. 
He 
was always trying to figure things out. 
He protected himself to,-
some extent with patents, but he later lost out.

the 
development of the hydraulic system. The development of all these 
things , timewise , made it easier for the Portuguese to go on and 
build these big, modern vessels . A lot of the stuff was tried 
earlier by the Italians and Yugoslays. 
They went from cotton nets 
to nylon nets. 
A lot of it was timing. 
The Portuguese 
are 
the 
really 
long-distance 
fishermen. 
The 
Yugoslays are second . The Italians, JR isn't sure why, whether 
they 're more inclined to family life, they were mostly coastal 
fishermen, go out for two or three days at a time. 
They didn't 
like those 90 and 120 day trips. 
The Portuguese by far were the 
real high-seas fishermen. 
JR was very unusual in fishing with the Yugoslays. 
He was one of--
the first to break the ethnic barrier . Prior to World War II, 
there were three ethnic groups in the San Pedro fishing fleet: 
Japanese -Americans , Italians , and Yugoslays. 
If you were of 
Italian background, you fished with the Italians . After World War 
II, only two or three of the Japanese families came back, most of 
them settled in other industries . But one of the problems JR had 
in organizing the union at that time was the strong ethnic hatred 
between the Yugoslays and the Italians over the Battle of Trieste. 
You'd go down to the docks and talk to a Yugoslav, and he'd show 
you a scar and say, 
'The dagos did that to me.' 
And then you'd 
talk to an Italian, he 'd say, 'I don 't want to get along with those 
slays, look at what they did to me.' 
JR had a hell of a time. 
He 
said, 
'I 
don't understand you guys .' 
The Italians were more 
religious and more Catholic -minded. 
Most of the Yugoslays were 
Catholic , but they didn 't go to church as much as the Italians did 
--they let their wives did. 
JR told them , 'you live as neighbors, 
you're all American, or becoming American, your kids go to the same 
schools together ,' and little by little they broke that barrier of 
intermarriage. 
For years and years if you come from an Italian 
family and try to date a Yugoslav girl, forget it. 
After World War 
II it broke wide open, they started to intermarry. 
JR told them, 
'what's the matter with you people? 
Why shouldn't you have one 
union to protect yourselves.' 
They've started mixing up the crews-

DOUG 2 \ 59 
on the boats today -- we have everything from American Indians to 
Mexican-Americans 
to 
Italian-Americans, 
Polacks, 
plus 
American -Americans. 
Before it was all strictly one ethnic group 
After Okinawa, 
JR had been sailing second mate with Waterman' 
Steamship . He was living with his parents , and one day a friend 
called him up and asked him if he wanted to go fishing . JR thought 
he meant sport fishing, so he said, sure. 
So he got JR on a boat.,, 
with his brother-in -law, the Claremont , and it was Yugoslay. JR 
X. 
took a hell of a beating because every time something went wrong s r6\\1G•— 
on the boat, they would blame JR. 
They'd tell the skipper in 
Yugoslav, 
'you're crazy -- when you bring an Italian on the boat,, 
you've got a Jonah , you've got a jinx . JR had a lot of problemsJ' 
but he was the first to break that barrier. 
Subsequently he wound up being the head man of a predominantly 
Yugoslav union , and even today people think that JR is Yugoslavian. 
As those generations died out, that hatred has died out. 
In recent-] 
tSrl+nG 
years there's been a second migration from Sicily, starting maybe 
twenty years ago. 
Now there's two Yugoslav skippers left in San fi 
Pedro, where it was once predominantly Yugoslay. 
Now it's all 
J 
Sicilians and Ischiatans. 
 
The canneries exploited ethnic hatred . They aided and abetted the 
AFL-CIO, which we classified as a company union. 
They favored the 
boat owners who brought people from the old country over here, and 
they'd 
join 
the 
AFL-CIO, 
because 
that 
supposed-union 
was 
cooperating with the canneries. 
And the Yugoslays were more 
militant than the Italians , they were tougher. 
It 's ironic how it 
turned around in JR's case. 
Though JR learned about labor from the 
time he was old enough to sit at the kitchen table and have a bowl 
of soup with the old man , and was raised in a strong union home, 
but he never thought he'd end up in the labor movement, but water 
seeks 
its 
level. 
When JR got up at the union meetings and 
complained , 
he was speaking about how he felt, and he was surprised 
that the others felt the same way but were afraid to speak out. 
A lot of the stuff that JR found here was a repeat of what his 
father had told him had gone on in the coal mines . JR got the idea 
of putting a union man on the scales here because that's what they 
did in the coal mines. 
When they brought a carload of coal out of 
the mine , it weighed two thousand pounds. 
If they put four 
thousand pounds of coal in it, 
it still weighed two thousand 
pounds. 
They found that they had put railroad ties under the 
scale, so the car would only come down to two thousand pounds and 
stop. 
So they figured out the square footage of coal that had been 
taken out , and what should have been paid the guys. 
But we can't 
measure the ocean , how much fish we took out of the ocean. 
But JR 
got the idea of putting a union man on the scale at the cannery 
DOUG 2 \ 60 
from the story his old man had told him about the mines. 
A lot of 
that stuff came in handy for JR. 
JR had been raised to be cognizant of the rights of working people, 
and objecting to the abuses and exploitation of working people. 
JR was looking for better conditions, not for a leadership role. 
As a kid, JR wanted to back to Colorado and have a cattle ranch. 
He used to go back in the summers and visit his uncles and cousins 
as a kid. 
There was nothing greater than the Rocky Mountains, and 
hunting and fishing. JR's life ambition was to go back and have 
ranch, but it never materialized. 
It's crazy how things work out. 
.7 
A lot of guys kid JR to this day, how does a goddamn dago from Wolf ,
 , 
Creek, Colorado, wind out in the goddamn ocean, fishing tuna and 
sardines, and then ends up the head of the union.' 
It just didn't 
fit. 
There were a lot of problems between the ethnic groups in the early 
days, and the employers exploited it to the hilt. 
They played one 
against the other to their own benefit. 
They would play favortism. 
The boats that cooperated with them would get better financial 
terms. 
Even though they were stealing from them, they would give 
them Christmas bonuses, or help them get a new engine for their 
boat. 
Then when they got more brazen about it, they got to the 
point where they were giving them a car as a Christmas bonus, and 
stuff like that. 
They spent years in court about that. 
They won, 
but it was stuff. 
The contracts now spell everything out. And we still have problems 
today. 
When they make settlements, they bring the settlements in 
here with the crews' sheets, and they scrutinize it and make sure 
everything is legitimate. 
And they still find people trying to 
cheat today. 
They used to have to tie the boat up and keep them 
from going out, which didn't make JR pretty popular. 
Now they're in a dying industry. 
Trying to keep these thirty 
mackerel boats alive. 
Looking for a resurgence of sardines, 
they're coming back. 
JR is fighting for good legislation, fighting 
the sports fishermen who are trying to put the commercial fishermen 
out of business. 
JR has gotten on a lot of committees and 
commissions, 
going 
to 
Washington, 
DC 
to 
fight Japanese 
tuna 
imports, became an advisor to the State Department on international 
fisheries. 
JR got involved with the Inter-American Tropical_ Tuna 
Commission, 
the International Commission_n A 
otlantic Tuna, 
the 
Pacific Fishery Development Foundation in Hawaii -- JR has been' 
vice=president of 
that for the past fifteen years. 
JR was the 
first labor representative to the Los Angeles Harbor Commission. 
Then he was the first guy out of the fish industry to get a 
presidential appointment, by President Nixon, and JR wasn't even 
a goddamn Republican. 
All of JR's appointments have come from 
Republicans, and he's a lifelong Democrat. 
JR's guesses he was the 
DOUG 2 \ 61 
token Democrat. 
A lot of these guys were political appointees but 
didn't have experience. 
JR was worried in the early days because 
he felt like he was out of water.

INTERVIEW CONTINUES ON IAW-DD-A011 
TIAW-DD-A011=Interview with John Royal, San Pedro, CA

Recorded with Marantz PMD-430, Sennheiser cardiod microphones in

TAPE 2 OF 2 
SIDE A 
John Royal (JR) : 
When fishermen are on the fishing grounds, whether 
they're in coastal waters or on the high seas, there's always a 
battle over the fish, who gets there first to catch it. In the old 
days these guys would actually take out shotguns and shoot at each 
other because they said they got on that school of fish first. But 
those problems were not because of ethnic group. 
The Yugoslays fished sardines until the season was over, 
then 
they'd put tuna nets on the boats and go to Mexico, while the 
Italians would continue to fish in coastal waters. And then later, 
some of the Italians went fishing long-distance, too. 
JR has been fighting with the Fish and Game people for five years 
to allow sardine fishing again. They've given them a thousand ton 
quota that begins January 1st. In the first week or ten days, that 
quota's filled up. They're arguing that the Fish and Game is too 
conservative, and they want to harvest more sardines. The industry 
has engaged a research outfit that's known worldwide, Living Marine 
Resources in LaHoya, to check the Fish and Game's statistics --
they're running about seven years behind. They used that to prove 
to the California Legislature and the California Fish and Game 
Commission at one time that they should have been getting more 
mackerel. They did the same with anchovies. Now they have to do the 
same thing with sardines. 
Sardines were always used for human 
consumption. Anchovies were used for fish meal, poultry feed, and 
for fish hatcheries. With the resurgence of sardines, it would be 
a tremendous economic shot in the arm for this fleet. 
In its heyday, they used to take about 750,000 tons of sardines a 
year. You could go over to Fish Harbor, and the decks would be 
covered with sardines. You could walk across the whole harbor, boat 
to boat, waiting for them to unload. In those days you unloaded by 
hand. Today you have suction pumps, they'll take the fish out of 
a boat in forty minutes, where they used to shovel fish for hours. 
1 
DOUG 2 \ 62 
But 
they're 
looking 
forward to 
getting back 
in 
the 
sardine 
industry. The biologists have always been ultraconservative. In the 
mackerel business, 
they took their own statistics, 
and using 
outside biologists they showed where the Fish and Game was 700 
percent off on their data, being ultra-conservative. They'll have 
to repeat that procedure with the sardines. 
There was a big argument in the fifties when the sardines started 
to disappear. They said the fishermen had overutilized the resource 
and 
ruined. 
But 
Dr. 
John 
Isaacs 
at 
Scripps 
Institute 
of 
Oceanography had a hypothesis that it was a migratory thing. It 
happened off of Japan, 
it happened off of South Africa. 
The 
sardines started up in Washington, worked into Oregon, then San 
Francisco was king for years, and Monterey was king for years, then 
the fish moved down here, and in 1946, 47, they started showing up 
in Mexican waters. So he contented it was a cyclic thing. 
Then they performed a project in LaHoya Canyon, called MoHole, and 
they core-drilled through the earth's crust from the ocean floor 
down. And when they brought these cores up and analyzed them, they 
found that for years and years there was a tremendous layer of 
sardine scales, but no anchovies or other species. And then they'd 
see where there was a lot of anchovies and no sardines. Since the 
early fifties, the sardines have been coming back more and more. 
After the 1000 tons are taken, which is nothing, they're allowed 
to take fifteen percent sardines with the mackerel without being 
given a citation by the Fish and Game. They got them to raise that 
up to thirty-five percent, and it still isn't enough, because they 
have to make a set on a hundred tons of fish out here at nighttime, 
and half is sardines and half is mackerel, and they have to dump 
it. And they're arguing it's a waste of the resource. 
JR was successful in getting $200,000 from the California State 
Environmental 
Affairs 
Agency, 
that 
gets 
money 
from 
offshore 
drilling, where fisheries have been impacted by offshore drilling, 
they've been able to get this money to continue the research on the 
sardines, and the Fish and Game is going to get $40,000 of that to 
put some of their technicians to work, because they didn't have the 
money. They've got a backlog of about seven years. Now maybe they 
can do it in a year or two. 
There used to be 150 boats here in San Pedro, that were mostly?• ,,

*+[)SAT 
•}+PYP arA ahoLt '•0 of them left. But when the. 
sardines moved down here, 
the season used to open two months 
earlier in San Francisco than in Monterey, when the season moved 
down here, 
the Monterey fleet and the fleets from Oregon and 
Washington would come all the way down here, and they'd have 400 
a` 
boats here. 
It was a 
_•h_bbub of activity, ten, twelve canner'-- 
`• working day and night, 15, 000 cannery w• • 
- 
is was all through 
the late thirties into the early fifties. 
DOUG 2 \ 63 
The fleet here tends to be thpsecond wave of Sicilian immigration. 
A lot of people will disagree with JR, but he would tend to say so. 
If you look at the people who are running the boats, as far as the 
Italian ethnic group goes, their mostly people who 
amP nea r frnm 
Sici 
d Ischia. We don't have the 
influx we once had of 
Yugoslays. Right After World War II they had a tremendous influx 
of Yugoslavians. To beat the military regime over there, they fled 
to Eqypt, and from Egypt to South America, and worked their way up 
through Mexico to here. They had a big influx of young Yugoslavians 
at that time. It didn't last. They stayed in fishing to make a few 
bucks, then they got involved in liquor stores and apartments, then 
they got involved in businesses and things of that nature, and they 
spread out into society. At one time it was strictly a father and 
son tradition 
,,•., g  
,_,,,,all of the fathers
— ,— both Yugosaav__arid`Italian, and 
the Portuguese just as well, told their_kidi', 'it's ya better way 
make a life 
go to 
scho•l';"become 
a_ 
doctor, a lawyer,,become an 
engineer, become something. ' And a lot of them did that. If the 
demise of the industry hadn't come about with the assistance of our 
government chasing them overseas with all the incentives, JR thinks 
they would have still had a strong fishing fleet here, but they saw 
that there was no real future to it, so they told their kids to gel 
the hell out and get an education. 
A lot of them went into restaurant businesses in town. In the old 
days you had maybe one or two Italian restaurants in town, today 
you've got pizza parlors on every corner, and Italian restaurants 
all over here. A lot of these people actually came from fishing 
families. Guys JR fished with went into real estate and have done 
very good. Now their sons and daughters are in it, and some of them 
have done very well that went into real estate early, here in San 
Pedro, like Libby DiBernardo and Tony Marino, and Tony Califano, 
and Frank Lauro. 
The Italian  community hangs together more than most communities. 
One problem the  a ad here is, like they have the 
ugoslav Club, 
the Italians never had a club of their own. In the early days, JR 
joined the Mazzini Club, and was a me mb  for years and years, and 
eventually became president o -the club. And then eventually the 
club just disintegrated, the old timers died off and nobody was 
playinq bocce no more, and the family gatherings, picnics, and 
dances fell-by  the wayside because the youngsters were going their, 
own way. 
The Mazzini 
Club was 
named after a guy who helped bring a 
cohesiveness into Italy years ago when it was all fragmented, his' 
name was Giuseppe Mazzini. The club started long before JR's time, 
and then it died out. It was reactivated by the old timers and it 
was passed on to their sons, and JR got involved at that time. But 
four or five years ago the club just closed up. 
They had a problem, the Filia d' Italia, the Sons of _Italy, then 
lv/ 
Gw•= 
DOUG 2 \ 64 
they had the Colombo Club, then they formed the Italian-American "t•-
Cub. JR tried very hard to raise that to them, he said, 'this is m
 •a•-ra 
crazy. You don't need ten different goddamn Italian-American clubs. 
Make one strong club, and the hell with it whether you call it the 
Sons of Italy or the Colombo Club.' In San Pedro you have the Sons 
of Italy, they have a little lodge house they bought of their own 
up here, the Mazzini Club went by the Wayside. JR doesn't know 
whether the Italian-American Club is still in existence or not. 
But you don't have that strong, well the Spaniards have it--JR 
knows because his wife is from Madrid--but the Yugoslav Club is by 
far 
the 
predominant 
club 
in 
town, 
with 
the 
biggest 
social 
functions. The Italians have them, but they're sort of fragmented. 
They used to have tremendous picnics and barbecues with the Mazzini 
Club, and then the Sons of Italy would have theirs. Each club 
would go to the other's. But if these guys would get together and 
just form a good Italian-American Club, 
and get rid of this 
difference between dialects, they could do, they have the money, 
there's several Italian families here, not only here but on the 
whole coast of California, that are very well off over the years, 
maybe started in fishing but got involved in other activities. So 
it's not that the Italian community is poverty-ridden. With the 
right people and the right leadership, you could start a march and 
put together a hell of a coalition, and really do a good job, to 
give them the political clout to preserve their way of life and 
culture, and to keep identity to their ethnic background. 
The Mazzini Club rented the Knights of Columbus Hall. JR kept 
telling them that they should get a place of their own, but they 
never did. The Sons of Italy bought the old Yugoslav Women's Club 
on the corner of 19th and Cabrillo. They have that now, but it's 
not very large. Over the years the Italians never did get together, 
and they should have, because they had the money and the manpower, 
but they never got together enough to buy some land and built 
themselves a good clubhouse. In most cities, they do have it. 
JR is the current president of the DB CLub. It's a social club that 
startg- 
up in Santa Barbara. These guys got 
together and—were 
socializing. They go all over and have dinners  and play bocce and 
play 
of ,
f 
, and awl tha . e; s 
Wrsre  for "Dago Bastard.!' It's funny 
as hell. The way JR thinks it started was that when these guys 
would go around and have their dinner parties, they're all good 
spenders, 
and 
somebody said, 
'Oh, 
here comes 
all 
those dago 
bastards again.' In the old days, if somebody called you a dago 
bastard, they wound up with a broken nose. Anyway, Tony Marino's 
brother and the guys in Santa Barbara -- our guys would go up there 
to the picnics first, 
so they got a charter from them, and JR 
became a charter member down here, it's been twenty years ago. They 
have their charter down here, and they get busloads of guys and go 
up to their picnics and dances, and then they come down here, and 
then they play golf and they raise a lot of money for cancer and 
the 
kidney 
foundation, 
and 
stuff 
like 
that, 
through 
golf 
ctv;:5 
DOUG 2 \ 65 
tournaments here and Las Vegas . It's a social club. People say — 
"Dago Bastards!" but it's a mixture. First of all you had to be, 
through marriage in order to get in. Now they have Judges in it and 
other people who are neither Italian or Yugo -- they're everything 
but Italian . It's a fun club , it's a good club. 
So JR is the k'P k 
current president. When they installed JR last January, he said, rG 
, 
'I have mixed emotions. All my life I grew up, and I got my nose 
broke fourteen times when someone called me a 'dago bastard' or a•`• 
'foreign-extraction son-of-a-bitch, ' or something like that. And 
now I'm up here taking bows and consider it a great honor to become 
the president of the Dago Bastards . I don't know how to rationalize 
it.' And they laughed like hell . But it's a good club. 
They have a picnic every August out at the Police pistol range, 
and they must get 400 people out there, women and kids, and they 
have games for the kids . It goes on all day, and you get all you 
want to eat, whether it 's swordfish , 
steak, sausage, and everything 
goes with it. Everything is covered , 
the booze, the wine, the games 
for the kids, the prizes . They just have a ball . More and more 
people want to attend that picnic. 
They 
just 
finished a 
olf 
tournament 
this 
weekend 
in 
Ojai, 
California . In September 
w•ter•e's going 
to 
be one for three days in , 
Las Vegas , a rivalry between the Dago Bastards of Santa Barbara and 
the Dago Bastards of San_Pedro over a cup 
they have All 
of"them 
kibbitz each other, " and they all cheat on their handicap. JR 
doesn't play golf, but he listens to that stuff. 
Where they really do a lot of good, they'll go to the Dunes or one 
of the big hotels in Las Vegas, 
and they'll have a big golf 
tournament. And people come from all over hell and participate, 
whether it costs five hundred or six hundred bucks or whatever. 
And this money all goes to a charity. For years it was cancer 
research . This year it's going to be for the Kidney Foundation. 
Last year they had a massive one , and the money went to the widows 
and dependents of the Marine Corps. They had four or five retired 
generals, and the marine corps band, and they had dignitaries from 
all over the country. 
The point is they have a lot of fun doing it, and all the profits 
go to a charitable organization. 
The San Pedro Chapter board of directors has bimonthly meetings, 
and membership meetings once a month . It's a dinner meeting at 
night time, and the guys come in, they can bring a guest in. If 
they don't wear their shirt they get fined, and if they get out of 
line they get fined. (They have 
e_hirts with_a"DB -logo pn it, and if 
a guy shows up without a shirt, 'o-kay collect two bucks from him.' 
If the guy argues , 'okay, 
get five bucks from that bastard.' 
They've got judges, doctors, lawyers in the club, and all their 
guests, they have a lot of fun.

Spent three hundred dollars. 
And 
they were having the party during the week. 
'Can you bring it to

Oh sure, no problem! 
For two or three hundred dollars you 
go out of your way. 
In the winter time there are more parties. 
From Christmas to 
Easter, AB sells a lot of fish. 
Right now AB doesn't sell ten 
pounds of shrimp a week. 
At Christmas, you sell a hundred pounds

People buy for Christmas. 
And then from Christmas to 
Easter, everybody eats fish, no meat. 
That's good for AB.

Up there it's busy. 
There's no ocean up there. 
Here, people are a lot closer to the

Some people get it 
for free, too. 
Those Yugoslav people, Italian people, they go 
there and get it for free. 
That's the way they want it.

Customer consults with AB on a dish he is making that night. 
AB: Can I come for dinner tonight? 
Customer responds, 'It's going to be a romantic dinner, Andy.' 
AB: Okay, I don't want to be there. 
Or you can make the romantic 
dinner another day. 
AB asks if customer is going to make 'like a cioppino.' 
Customer 
is making a dish called 'Seafood Vera Cruz, ' 
with tomatoes, capers, 
olives. 
'Sounds like a cross between Spanish and Italian.' 
AB: 
Yeah, 
it's going to be like a cioppino, with the fish all 
mixed. 
So you have to have something that doesn't fall apart. 
You can put in shark or swordfish. 
Customer objects because girlfriend doesn't like either, 'it's too 
much like real meat.' 
AB: Salmon? No. 
Red snapper. 
Or you can put halibut. 
Customer decides on red snapper. 
AB gets snapper, and asks if 
anything else, suggests salmon. 
Customer decides salmon would be 
good. 
Customer points to another type of fish.

Goes out again at one o'clock. 
If everyone is at home, AB can finish quickly. 
But sometimes a few 
people keep you all day. 
Tonight there are four people who come 
after four o'clock. 
AB goes to his aunt's house for coffee at 
three, and stays until four. 
From two to 2:45, AB returns home. 
Then he goes out again. 
Stays at his aunt's house for an hour,

TAPE 1 OF 1 
SIDE A 
GianVittorio Perniciaro (GP) was born in Bari, on the mainland of 
Italy, 
in the region of Apulia. 
His family is Sicilian. 
His 
father was a high-ranking official of the military department 
attached to customs, and he was transferred throughout Italy. 
Both 
of GP's parents are Sicilian. 
GP moved to Sicily shortly after his 
birth, and lived all his life in Sicily. 
Attended schools in 
DOUG 2 \ 81 
Palermo, attended the University of Palermo. 
Beginning in college, GP started working for the United States 
Consulate General in Palermo. 
He worked for them for nearly ten 
years. 
Developed a "Dr.-Jekyll-Mr.-Hyde Syndrome." He was working 
for eight hours a day "in the United States of America," in the 
consulate, then sixteen hours a day in Italy. 
You can only do that 
for so many years. 
You wonder which country you work for. 
GP grew 
fond of the way Americans ran business, and found himself a fish 
out of water in Italy. 
So he emigrated to the United States, and 
has never regretted. 
GP came to the United States in 1968. 
He originally settled in 
New York City, lived there only one winter. 
That convinced him it 
was 
not the place to be 
for 
someone 
from Sicily where the 
temperature 
was 
seventy 
year-round. 
Though he 
enjoyed 
the 
nightlife and misses it. 
So GP came to the West Coast and came to Southern California, which 
is a climate closer to the one he left in Italy. 
GP was born in 1940. 
GP settled in Oakland first, and stayed there for a couple of 
years. 
Then they moved back to New York because of a family 
situation that had to be resolved. 
Moved back for a year, then in 
1972 they moved back to the West Coast and settled in San Pedro. 
GP was working in the shipping business. 
He was working with the 
shipping companies on the West Coast, and became executive vice 
president for a company in Los Angeles. 
Then in 1984, GP had 
always loved motorcycling, and in 1984 GP and his wife went for a 
cycle tour of Europe, 
and GP decided he should start his own 
business. 
In 1985, GP started Bike Tours Unlimited, the company 
he runs today. 
Has an agreement with Alitalia to take American 
motorcyclists to Italy. 
Leave from Los Angeles, and put their 
machines in the cargo hold of the same 747 they are flying in. 
Fly to Milan, eleven hours nonstop. 
When they land, they get their 
motorcycles, fuel them up and go. 
GP shows them the beauty of 
Italy, from the Alps to the Italian Riviera, Liguria. 
Then, since 
GP has always been a humanist, has always loved the gift that Italy 
has given to the world, takes them to medieval Italy, to Florence, 
Pisa. 
Then down along the Chianti road to show them the wineries 
of Italy -- a far cry from the sophisticated wineries of California 
-- we still make the wines the old way. 
Then to eternal Rome, to' 
the Vatican and the beauties of the eternal city. 
Then southward 
to the abbey of Montecassino, destroyed and rebuilt four times in 
its history. 
Then further down to the Amalfi coastline, the pearl 
of Italy. 
Spend five days in Positano, in a grand hotel perched 
three hundred feet above the Mediterranean. A very beautiful place 
-- it's a very classy tour. 
And then to Capri island, and then 
DOUG 2 \ 82 
back to Pompeii, and then back to Rome and fly back here, 
for 
fifteen days. 
GP does this several times each year. 
As people come back and talk with their friends about the beauty 
and the art and the sheer love that Italy and Italians can give to 
you, the word passes around, and GP does very little advertising. 
He only places a small ad in a major motorcycling magazine. 
GP usually takes eight or nine couples, a maximum of nine to ten 
motorcycles including GP's. 
GP tows a trailer with the luggage of 
his customers. 
This throws off Italians, because they're not 
allowed to tow trailers in Italy, but foreigners are, whatever is 
legal in your country. 
So there is a combination of awe and envy 
when they see us rolling down the road. 
GP varies the tour depending on the requests of the customers, as 
long as they're all in agreement. 
Customers are free to do what 
they want in Italy. 
If they want to spend fifteen days in Venice 
while the group goes to Amalfi, that's fine with GP. 
They will 
meet in Rome and fly back. 
The last group wanted to go to Paris 
-- you can get to Paris in eight or nine hours. 
Voila, nous 
allons. 
GP speaks French, so there was no problem. 
But they were 
disappointed -- GP warned them that it would be crowded in France, 
and it was. 
GP has only had one Italian-American customer, a second-generation 
Italian. 
These are American people. 
As GP goes to motorcycle 
clubs and gives them his twenty-minute slide presentation, they get 
so interested and enthusiastic, they want to emulate. 
Most of GP's 
customers are Americans, middle- and upper-class Americans. 
While Bike Tours Unlimited has been feeding GP's pocked, it hasn't 
fed his mind. 
He needed something else that would appease his 
desire for keeping his culture in touch with Italy. 
When GP was 
working for the American Foreign Service in Italy, he came in touch 
with a segment of the population called immigrants. 
These were 
people who would come back to Italy either to retire or to get 
married. 
These were Italians who had emigrated to the United 
States. 
When they talked to GP, he realized that they were talking 
a very strange language. 
They would come to get married and take 
a wife, and they'd refer to the wife as "spousa," not "mulia" (sp?) 
as it is in Italian. 
There were words that intriqued GP. 
But he 
was not aware that it was a language, thought that it was just 
colloquialisms that Italian-Americans would use because they were 
not educated in Italy. 
Then when GP came to American in 1968, he 
became aware of the fact that there was such a language. 
Contrary 
to the dialects in America, American Italian is consistent whether 
you're living in Queens, New York, or on Columbus Avenue in San 
Francisco. 
They use the same type of language. 
A few years ago GP decided to analyze this language. 
He went on 
a research/business trip that took him from the East Coast, to the 
DOUG 2 \ 83 
Southeast, to the West Coast. 
He was gone for over two months. 
Spent times in Queens, the Bronx, Connecticut, Chicago, Miami, Los 
Angeles, San Francisco. 
What came out was tape, as you are taping 
me. 
GP took a tape recorder, did a few interviews, but mostly went 
to Italian bars in Italian sections, settled down with a glass of 
wine, and let the tape recorder. 
Then went to the hotel, and took 
out excerpts of words, here and there, and started working on a 
dictionary. 
And finally, GP put together a dictionary which is 300 
pages, 
and 
gives 
a broad 
spectrum 
of 
this 
language 
that 
Italian-Americans speak. 
For the purpose of making the reader 
understand the language better, GP translated, actually it's a 
three-way dictionary. 
It will have a word that is spoken in this 
language 
here 
by 
Italian-Americans, 
and 
then 
the 
same 
word 
translated into proper Italian, and into American language. 
And 
a cross-reference in each of these languages. 
Then GP went ahead and founded the company, The Heritage of Italy 
in America, and started marketing the dictionary through it. 
The 
dictionary has an appendix that translates American names into 
Italian, and vice versa. 
Indicates Italian foods and other Italian 
peculiarities, Italian idiomatic phrases and American idiomatic 
phrases, how they translate a phrase into another. 
It's been 
pretty successful. 
GP has been selling the dictionary for the past 
year-and-a-half or so. 
One of the beauties of Italy is that you have different dialects 
throughout the land. 
It is a beauty because it gives each region 
its own individualism. 
It is a different shade of the tricolor 
that makes the Italian flag. 
You have people that live in the 
Piedmont, whose dialect is affected by their neighboring France. 
You have people living in the Friuli region of Italy, 
whose 
language is affected by the neighboring Austria. 
In Sicily the 
language has been affected by influx and domination, starting with 
the Phoenicians down to the Spanish and the Moors. 
So these 
dialects are all different. 
The common denominator, taught in the 
schools, is the Italian language. 
When you come to America, you have to see what affected the idiom 
spoken by Italian-Americans to bring it about. 
You have to look 
at the quality of the education of the people who emigrated to this 
country. 
It was not very high, and this is not derogatory. 
These 
are people without whom this country would not be what it is today. 
America should be grateful to immigrants from all nations for 
coming here and giving their input. 
But nevertheless you had 
people who could barely read and write in their own language. 
These people only spoke their dialects, 
and faced a language -
totally different to what they were accustomed to, a cacaphony of 
sound, very few vowels, a lot of consonants, some vowels you don't 
pronounce. 
Faced with a language like this they had either to swim 
or drown, to find something they could communicate with. 
So they 
decided to go ahead and adjust these words as if they were of an 
Italian format. 
So you have words like "store," it's very easy, 
lri 
DOUG 2 \ 84 
you put an "o" on the end and it becomes "storro." 
Now you can 
pronounce it. 
It's difficult for an Italian to say store. 
You 
take a word such as "to drive a car." 
"To drive" is not a word an 
Italian can pronounce. 
It becomes "drivare," the verb. 
In Italian 
you say "guidare," here you say, "drivare." 
And on and on. 
This language spoken by the first immigrants to this country, as 
they attempted to communicate and be understood, was the language 
their children heard. 
So to them, to take the car and go for a 
ride was "drivare" when they spoke to their parents. 
And they, in 
turn, 
taught their 
children, 
not taught 
formally, 
but their 
children heard them. 
And so this language continued. 
And as they 
spoke with their neighbors, their friends, so they communicate in 
this language. 
And all of a sudden you have a third language, 
which is not Italian, is not American, but it's a hybrid language 
which is a mixture of both of them. 
And it's uniform throughout 
this country. 
GP didn't find any variation from community to community. 
He did 
find words that were unknown in certain parts of the country, due 
to environment and situation. 
For instance, in the Chicago area, 
GP found a word that is unheard on the West Coast. 
The word is 
"shovelare." 
What does "shovelare" mean? 
When you were snowed in 
and you wanted to get out of the house, you have to get the shovel, 
and you have to shovel out. 
So shovel became "shovelare," "to 
remove the snow." 
of course, in the Los Angeles and San Francisco 
area, they never heard the word "shovelare." 
But you go to the 
Chicago and Michigan area, in the Italian communities it's a very 
popular word. 
You have kids here who go to the beach surfing. 
"Surfare" is a 
word common in the Italian communities here. 
Mama tells Tony, 
"Tony, where you going?" 
"Ma, I'm going to surfare." 
You will 
not find this in Alaska, if there's an Italian community there. 
Other than these difference in variation due to environment, GP 
found no differential in the language spoken in the east and west 
coasts of the United States. 
GP researched this in Queens, Brooklyn, Hartford, Chicago, Miami, 
Fort Lauderdale, San Pedro, San Francisco. 
In San Francisco, GP 
worked exclusively on Columbus Avenue. 
You could spend a lifetime 
on Columbus Avenue and meet all sorts of people of Italian descent. 
There is a common language spoken in San Pedro spoken by both the 
Sicilians and Ischians. 
Both Sicily and Ischia are islands. 
It' 
is a fact of life that on islands that the main source of work is 
fishing. 
The people from Ischia are mostly fishermen, and so are 
the people from Sicily who are here in San Pedro. 
While the 
Sicilian community is not a large community in relation to Sicily, 
there are more people from Ischia in San Pedro than there are in 
Ischia itself. Every second person in San Pedro is from Ischia, and 
DOUG 2 \ 85 
they don't call it Ischia, they call it "Ishchia," because they use 
their own dialect where the "s" is not sibilant, but becomes "shh," 
like "she." 
But if you have a person from Ischia, an Ischitano, 
talk his dialect, he will talk a Neopolitan dialect. 
And a person 
from Sicily, depending on where in Sicily he's from, he will speak 
a dialect that is maybe a Trapanese or Palermitano or a Catanese. 
These three dialects are different, one from another, even though 
they're from the same island. 
So if an Ischitano and a Sicilian 
were to engage in a conversation in their own dialect, they would 
not be able to communicate. 
Because they came to San Pedro without 
a formal education, with a few exceptions, they would not be able 
to communicate in Italian, either. 
Depending on the degree of 
culture they had in this country, the degree of education, they 
might not be able to communicate in American either. 
So that 
leaves what? 
That leaves this other language. 
If you go to a bar, 
it's interesting to hear these people communicate in this language. 
It would drive an Italian crazy, completely crazy. 
If you were to 
sit there and listen to a person from Ischia talk to a person from 
Sicily in a language that is neither Ischitano, nor Neapolitan, 
nor Sicilian, nor American, nor Italian. 
My God, what is it? 
And 
yet these people talk to each other and they communicate, and it's 
wonderful, absolutely marvelous. 
They found a way to communicate. 
TAPE 1 OF 1 
SIDE B 
GP hasn't noticed any social class difference between Sicilians 
and Ischitani in San Pedro. 
First of all, you have to look at what 
San Pedro has to offer in terms of jobs. 
This community is not a 
very developed one in terms of mechanization and production and 
business. 
You have one very large employer, the shipyard, which 
is closing down. 
And then you have the fishing industry. 
What you 
have here because there-is not much to offer in employment, is 
people working in all segments of the activities in town. 
The 
third 
largest 
employer 
is 
the 
International 
Longhoremen 
and 
Warehousemen Union, the dockers. 
When GP worked in the shipping 
industry, 
he was very much exposed to the dockers, 
and the 
longshoremen, you will find they are Sicilians, Ischians, all kinds 
of people of Italian descent and other nationalities. 
But the 
[Sicilians] and Ischitani work shoulder to shoulder. 
In the matter 
of type of work, there is no differentiation. 
Where there is a little differentiation is in white-collar type of . 
work. 
The Ischitani have pursued careers in real estate, and they 
have been fairly successful. 
The Sicilians have pursued interests 
in investing in the fishing industry. 
There, one segment of the 
Italian community is going toward something non-tangible such as 
selling and buying homes for people, while the others pursued 
tangible interests like buying boats and putting people to work for 
them. 
DOUG 2 \ 86 
GP doesn't know whether this 
difference 
relates 
to 
time 
of 
migration. 
He has to relate it to his experience working for the 
American Foreign Service. 
In the consulate visa section, between 
1960 and early 1970, the American Consulate General in Palermo 
handled the visa applications for Sicily and the province of Reggio 
di Calabria, 
not all Calabria, 
just Reggio di Calabria. 
The 
majority of the people trying to emigrate to the United States was 
from the province of Trapani, the westernmost part of Sicily where 
the economic conditions were the worst 
in the whole 
island, 
immediately followed by the province of [?] in the south of Sicily. 
Out of these two main immigration points to the United States, the 
majority going to the west coast, to San Diego, San Francisco, Los 
Angeles, were from Trapani, people especially from the area of 
Marsala and Marsalavalo [?]. 
And these were fishermen. 
If you go 
into the fishing community of San Diego, most of the fishermen are 
Sicilian, and most are from the city of Marsalavalo. 
Just like 
everybody from Ischia came to San Pedro, everybody from Marsala 
came to San Diego. 
The period of immigration, 
in the early 
sixties, 1960, Public Law 86-363 was put through. 
And there was 
a tremendous influx, there was forty thousand visa numbers, and a 
tremendous number of Sicilians came to the west coast. 
GP knows 
Marsalavalo quite well because his parents were born there, though 
they 
lived 
in 
Palermo, 
their 
roots 
were 
in 
Marsalavalo. 
Marsalavalo got completely bled of young people between the years 
1960 and 1963. 
GP has no data on when the people from Ischia moved 
here. 
Judging from conversations, GP gets the impression that the 
Ischians immigrated here before the Sicilians did, 
in the late 
fifties. 
He also gets the impression that they didn't come 
directly to San Pedro, but immigrated either via Canada or from 
South America. 
There's a lot of people from Ischia who did not 
come straight to San Pedro, but came via some other place. GP gives 
examples. 
There was an -in-between stop of a few-months or years. 
There has 
always been an intermediate stop -- even in GP's case. 
There is 
always a period of adjustment. 
People stop as if a bird would when 
it's migrating, stops en route and rests, and then continues the 
journey. 
A large proportion of San Pedro's Sicilian population is from 
Terasini. 
Terasini 
is 
a port 
city 
just 
north 
of 
Palermo, 
thirty-five to forty kilometers north of Palermo. 
Terasini had 
the largest fishing fleet in the north part of Sicily. 
The largest 
fleet in the southern part was in Marsalavalo. 
So it goes without 
saying that the people here who are from Terasini are fishermen, 
or if not directly, those who immigrated here were fishermen. 
They 
immigrated to San Pedro to go into the fishing industry. 
If you 
go to the docks and look at the boats' names, they are names that 
are typically Sicilian on the boats. 
GP knows quite a few people 
from Terasini. 
For example, 
Matteo Logrande, 
he's a retired 
fisherman, ninety-one years old, and this man came here when he was 
DOUG 2 \ 87 
sixteen or fifteen years old from Terasini. 
And he spend all his 
life pulling nets here in San Pedro, sailing from San Pedro to 
Alaska. 
The thing that is amazing is how even third-generation -- these 
people are not even Italians, they were born in this country, they 
were reared in this country, they were educated in this country, 
they have nothing Italian -- and yet they are so proud of being 
Italian. 
The moment they meet GP, they say, 
'oh, you're Italian! 
So am I!' 
And you can see how proud they are. 
That's on the positive side. 
On the negative side is the fact that 
they don't speak one word of Italian. 
As strong as they feel about 
being Italians, they do not feel the impelling need to read and 
study what Italy is all about, what Italy has given to the world. 
They could care less. 
GP has found that Italian-Americans here, 
as long as they can spend money to prove that they are Italians, 
they can buy the fifteen-dollar t-shirt that says, "I'm Proud of 
Being Italian," or the twenty-dollar licence-plate frame that says, 
"I'm Italian," that's okay. 
But the moment that they have to put 
personal involvement, go into a library, sitting down, reading, 
studying, learning to love what Italy, this country that they don't 
even know, is about, they drop the ball. 
And that's the negative 
side of it. 
That's what GP is trying to promote with The Heritage 
of Italy in America, that's what he's trying to promote with the 
Dictionary of Italian-American Immigrants, is that these people go 
beyond just saying, 'I'm Italian,' and understand what the meaning 
is. 
There's a lot of meaning. 
The little word, "Italy," there is 
so much in it that so few other countries in the world have. 
That's what GP wants people to understand. 
You have to look at what prompts an individual, a man or a woman, 
to leave his own land, to leave what he loves, to leave his closest 
friends, to abandon his home, to go someplace else, to make a jump 
in the dark for the sake of improving himself and his family. 
What 
makes this happen is in small percentage a spirit of adventure, a 
very small percentage. 
This you find in recent generations where 
you find young Italians coming to America on an immigrant visitor 
visa for a spirit of adventure, and then for a spirit of adventure 
they stay, they marry an American and they stay. 
But in the old 
times, people emigrated because they needed to, especially in the 
post-war ravaged Italy. 
Jobs were scare, the economy was not what 
it is today, the economic boom of Italy didn't start until the 
mid-fifties. 
So between 1945 and 1955 you had a tremendous amount 
of people who left Italy to come to the United States. 
And then 
when the economy cooled again in the sixties, then you had a second' 
wave of immigrants to this country. 
In both cases, you had a 
problem in Italy, you had people that could not afford to go to 
school, they had to go to the fields and work, children as young 
as four and five. 
It destroys a person's ability to read and write 
and build some kind of an education and improve themselves. 
DOUG 2 \ 88 
Then the economy dictated a change, 
and so they came to this 
country. 
So what you have is a wave of immigration of people who 
are not formally educated, and they get into the infrastructure of 
the American labor force, and they try to make a living the best 
they can. 
They're not educated, and they can't go to school in 
this country, they just have to work. 
So the first people to 
benefit are not them, but their children. 
These are the people 
that came here and deprived themselves of food so they could spend 
money on their children's education. 
They were very aware that 
they had to send them to school, and they deprived themselves of 
clothing, the necessities of life, so they could spend a penny on 
their children's education. 
And the children went to school in 
this country. 
And of course a brain is a brain, if you feed a 
brain, you get something out of it, so as the children went to 
school 
and 
learned, 
they 
improved themselves. 
By 
improving 
themselves, they improved the whole family and helped the parents. 
Both GP and his wife write for the Long Beach Press-Telegram, a 
local newspaper, occasionally. 
GP's wife wrote a letter to the 
Press-Telegram about immigration, which is so soul-searching. What 
she says is basically this: that the children helped the parents 
improve themselves, as they went to school and learned, they tried 
and did what they could to improve the station of the parents. 
Language-wise, they had very little to learn from their parents, 
very little as far language is concerned. 
What they learned from 
their parents was the wrong language to begin with. 
But when they 
learned it, the parents didn't know it was wrong, how could the 
children know? So they perpetrated this diction which is improper, 
and involuntarily transmitted it to the third generation. 
And yet 
you had this desire to succeed, desire to improve themselves, 
desire to be different, in a society that seems to adopt itself on 
staying at a certain level, and not aim for anything more than you 
can get daily, live day to day. 
If you look at American society 
today, it's living one day to another, there are no long-term plans 
on the average. 
You find that Italians, 
and probably other 
immigrants, too, Italians aimed high. 
They tried, they earned, 
they pushed, to try and succeed. 
Their success became their family 
success. 
In this town, you have a few families that have taken that pattern. 
Their names are known, of the families that have succeeded in this 
town. 
The same thing, 
if you go back to Sicily, a couple of 
families succeeded and they went ahead, and put their people in the 
best places. 
And so it happened here. 
But it is a fact that, 
Italians tried hard through two or three generations in the United 
States, to build an image, and they succeeded on the average. 
And 
it is very gratifying to see this, because unfortunately, take GP's 
case. 
He's Sicilian, spent his whole life and was educated there. 
It bothers GP no end when they ask him, 
and he says, 
'I'm a 
Sicilian.' 
Oh my God, here we go -- Mafia. 
The word Mafia comes 
up again. 
It bothers GP to no end because the Mafia is a dot 
DOUG 2 \ 89 
spanning only about fifty years, 
in a fulgent history of five 
thousand years, where Sicily has spearheaded art in the basin of 
the Mediterranean. 
The most beautiful coins in the world are the 
Greek coins of Sicily. 
And in 
the court of Roger II in Palermo 
the language of Italian was born officially. 
And yet people look 
at Sicily and remember only the last fifty years because of this 
blotch called Mafia, that has been putting a cloud over our head. 
And they forget the four-thousand-nine-hundred-and-fifty years 
before. 
[GP tells his wife to get the letter she wrote.] 
It is terrible. 
It would be like saying to a person who is from 
Los Angeles, "oh, you're a gang member." 
It is the same parallel. 
There's a population in Los Angeles of millions of people that are 
good law-abiding citizens, 
and a handful of bastards that are 
making the others look bad. 
[GP reads letter by his wife, Liliana.]: 
"The Good Old Days 
How dare people knock down the police department for failing to 
supply an interpreter to a Spanish-speaking man. 
I am an American 
citizen. 
But I was an alien first, having immigrated to this 
country with my parents as a young girl in the late fifties. 
Both 
my sister and I went to school immediately after our arrival here. 
We did not expect to be taught in our native tongue. When we went 
to the supermarket or to some other public place, we did not speak 
Italian to the people around us and expect them to make the effort 
to understand us. We attempted, as best we could, to make ourselves 
understood, using what little English we knew, and where we could 
not, we took along someone who could speak for us. I admit that it 
was hard the first year, going to school day after day without 
understanding a thing that was being said in the classrooms. It was 
frustrating 
not 
being 
able 
to 
communicate 
with 
anyone, 
or 
participate in any of the school activities. But, if-nothing else, 
this made us want to learn faster and work harder toward mastering 
the language of our new home. We cried a lot that year. And we 
missed our homeland terribly. 
But we hung 
in there, 
and we 
survived. We learned the language and taught our parents what we 
could. We asked for nothing other than a chance to make this 
country our home, and received so much more in return. A lot has 
changed since then it seems, as evidenced by all the services aimed 
at the non-English-speaking immigrant. 
When we, and millions of 
others, came to America long ago, we had to learn or do without. 
That was our incentive. 
What incentive do aliens of today have?_ 
Where is it all leading? Where is it going to stop?" 
This is a letter that is soul-searching. 
In a few lines you have 
the story of a young girl who comes to the United States and goes 
to school. She cannot speak English, but she is not trying to speak 
in Italian to people. 
She is trying to learn the language. 
And 
when 
she 
cannot 
communicate 
she 
will 
ask 
someone 
who 
can 
DOUG 2 \ 90 
communicate for her to come along and help. 
And as she learns she 
goes back and teaches her parents. 
Now this is something really 
touching. 
And then you have another thing about this which is really typical 
of the Italians who immigrated to this country. And it's just one 
line that says that: 
'We asked for nothing other than a chance to 
make this country our home, and received so much more in return." 
This is an acknowledgment that a lot of immigrants don't have, a 
lot of Italian immigrants do. 
They come to this country and fall 
in love with it, and work hard to make this country better. Yet, 
they never forget where they came from. 
Mrs. Perniciaro. 
Article is dated, Sunday, May 15, 1983, Long Beach Press-Telegram. 
GP has also written for the paper. 
There's a whole wall of 
editorials that GP has written for the Press-Telegram, but he 
writes about subjects that are not about immigration. He writes 
about how people should be proud of what they have in this country. 
It should not take an Italian to go public and write that people 
should love America, it should take an American. GP is very proud 
of being an Italian-America. 
It makes sense. 
What GP has today 
is what his country gave him, his education, trying to improve 
himself, wanting to come to this country. 
Once he came here, this 
is the country that has given him a living, put the roof over his 
head, this is the country that is making his children what they 
are. 
GP has to be grateful for that. 
He can never forget what he 
comes from, he will never forget what has come to him. 
GP is proud of all phases of his life. 
If you look at his 
motorcycles, each motorcycle has a plaque on it, 
in bronze, and 
this plaque says, "I'm Proud to be an Italian-American." 
There 
are the flags of the United States and Italy, right next to each 
other. 
And that's the way it should be.
