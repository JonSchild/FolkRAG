Dr. Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music Library of Congress Washington, D. C.
My dear Dr. Spivacke:
The majority of the field work for a recording of Florida folk songs was done in preparation
for the visit of Herbert Halpert of the Federal Theatre Project in June of this year. His
trip was cut short so that only a few of these recordings were made. Zora Neale Hurston
completed contacts for Negro recordings at the turpentine camp in Cross City and in
Tampa before she was called to Philadelphia.
A report on the types of songs and locations was submitted to the WPA Folk Arts
Coordinating Committee in Washington, copies of which are enclosed. One of these
reports is by Stetson Kennedy now with the Florida Music Project, whose reports on
Florida folklore were especially commended by the Folk Arts Committee. His opportunity
to study Cuban folklore is good due to his wife's family connections in the Latin colony
at Tampa. It is our plan to give him responsibility for explanatory matter and for such
supplementary information as should accompany the songs.
Bob Cook, with the Federal Writers' Project, is a radio technician, and has operated such
machines. He is to run the machine and assist in the interviews. He was present when Mr.

Halpert made the recordings in Jacksonville, and took notes on the types of questions to
ask the singers.
As to the selection of songs, we are using Mr. Alton Morris, editor of Southern Folklore
Quarterly, as consultant on songs by native whites; Zora Hurston will continue to act as
our consultant on Negro songs. We are forwarding to her check lists of any Negro songs
we find, so that she may make the selections.
As you surmised, we were confused by Presto labels on the packages of records which
were from the Library of Congress. Attached 2 is copy of shipping order on the needles.
Regarding continuation of the Florida Writers' Project, our project proposal has been
signed by the State WPA Administrator and is now in Washington. As soon as I know
it has been approved, in accordance with your suggestion, I will make the request for
extension of time limit on the use of the machine through the proper WPA channels.
I trust this information will reassure you as to the precautions we are taking on use of the
machine and records. However, if there are any instructions you wish to give us, we will be
very glad to comply with them.
Sincerely yours, Carita Doggett Corse Carita Doggett Corse State Director Federal Writers'

P. S. Due to the bulkiness of the reports to the WPA Folk Arts Coordinating Committee in
Washington, we are mailing these separately.
