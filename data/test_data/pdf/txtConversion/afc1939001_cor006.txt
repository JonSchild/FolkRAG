Dear Mr. Spivacke:
Please get from Mr. Putnam a general letter explaining and commending my purpose in
asking favors of Governor and others as I travel through the South. I need these character
testimonials to save my face with people who do not think highly of folk song collectors.
With high regards always.
Sincerely yours, John A. Lomax
