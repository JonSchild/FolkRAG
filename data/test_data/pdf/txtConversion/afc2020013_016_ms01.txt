Biographical Info and Early Memories Racing 
 
 
Growing up in Lancaster / Depew area (east of Buffalo) 
First experience racing at Lancaster Speedway (which is an asphalt track), with 
an Uncle who ran hot rods that took him to a stock car program when he was 
seven or 8 years old, sometime around 1970/71 
First Dirt track racing experience was actually watching the dirt racing at the Erie 
County Fair – Buffalo Raceway at the Hamburg Fairgrounds: which is used for 
horses throughout the year, but for the erie county fair they would have races 
Story of how he first got involved with racing as an adult, a friend met through 
an adult softball league (Charlie Hoddick), whose brothers both raced at 
Lancaster: became best friends with Chuck, who then asked him to be on his Pit 
Crew around the late 1980s 
Would watch at Ransomville but race at Lancaster (street stock): Alex Friesen 
developed an asphalt sportsman class, and they were the first champions of that 
class 
 
[5:00]  
Early Track Official Experience and Career 
Charlie stopped racing in 1997 
In 2000, Chuck became Race Director at Lancaster Speedway, and asked John to 
become an on track official on a part time basis. 
2001-2008, full time on track official (assistant starter), and in 2008/9-2010, 
became the Race Director at Lancaster Speedway 
2010, stepped down from Race Director at Lancaster Speedway to takeup a 
position with DIRTcar Northeast Organization as 358 Series director, still with 
them since in a series director and race director role 
End of 2018 and in 2019, helped out as Race Director at Ransomville Speedway, 
before being appointed as Race Director in 2020 – although 2020 didn’t run, was 
technically his first year 
Going back to Lancaster Speedway and his first experiences as a track official, 
started out as a turn official before becoming an assistant starter 
Story from 2013, being a full-time starter, during a race in Holland – and cars 
collided with the flagstand he was on, destroying it: luckily he escaped major 
injuries 
 
[8:45] 
Being a Race Director for a Series instead of at a Weekly Track and Differences 
between Asphalt and Dirt Racing 
Going to and traveling around to racetracks everywhere, primarily throughout 
New York State, but also through Ontario and Quebec 
Taking the same ‘program’ and racing at different places throughout at other 
tracks, and that being really  
Multiple race directors, as there’s also the other jobs they have, so usually 
balanced between the schedules of those four race directors 
Discussion of differences in drivers and driving styles on asphalt and dirt, 
including practice time leading up to it 
Traveled to Ransomville as part of the series from 2010 on, but in terms of the 
weekly Friday night officiating as a Race Director at Ransomville, wasn’t until 
2018/19 
 
[11:55]  
Responsibilities of a Race Director 
Discussion of the different responsibilities of a race director – being in charge of 
the ‘racing program’, at Ransomville it being setup almost as a ‘triangle’ between 
himself, Jeff, and the general manager 
Communicating with on track and off track officials 
Use of radios as the race director 
Work of a race director primarily takes place in the tower, but before a race 
heads over to the pits and also after a race to help answer any questions 
Keeping an eye on the drivers during the race and making calls and responding 
to incidents or accidents on the track 
Discussion of differences between working at a weekly track and working for a 
series (that travels around to different tracks) 
 
 
Importance of the ‘run of show’ being really important 
 
 
 
 
[16:40]  
Learning the Skills of a Race Director & Common Calls as a Race Director 
Mention of the different people who he learned from as Race Director, some 
specific to race directing but also working alongside in different track official 
positions 
Discussion of different calls might have to make during a race, including 
purposeful contact, purposeful spinning, etc.: including the different penalties 
that might go along with them 
DIRTcar Northeast has a rulebook for all divisions which Race Director’s abide 
by, and Ransomville Speedway does as well – both available to driver’s to 
reference online or in paper form 
Safety changes are the only major things that change in the rulebooks, not many 
procedural changes especially on the equipment side over the years, as 
equipment is expensive and don’t want to make a racer ‘outspend’ their budget 
 
[20:00]  
Changes in Race Director Over Time 
Impact of Technology – the AMB Scoring – on the Race Director role was really 
major, but some technology like things going on the Jumbotron or replay or that 
kind of stuff, usually know the call ahead of time it is up there, but the replays 
help to check those calls against it 
Race Director role thinking about entertainment also during downtime, so with 
the Jumbotron that might look like putting up a replay of something that just 
happened while cleaning up an accident 
Hand scoring still continues, but as a supplement to the electronic scoring now 
where it used to be just hand scoring 
Importance of one way radios to improving safety on the track 
Being Race Director both at Ransomville and continuing his race director role 
with DIRTcar Northeast 
 
[23:45]  
Walkthrough of Race Week and Race Day 
Discussion of walkthrough of race week, including any special events like a 
memorial race and doing a driver’s lineups, fireworks, etc., coordinated with 
General manager who’d send it out as an agenda memo 
Discussion of Race Day, starting with arrival at the track and heading over to the 
pits, making sure everyone’s where they need to be, taking a look at the track 
and all things are working and in good condition (e.g. lights, etc.) through to 
what goes on during the race, to post-race follow-ups in the pit area 
 
[26:35]  
Walkthrough of Skills as a Race Director During a Race 
Getting into a pattern in terms of what you are looking for in a race: looking 
especially for cars that are running two or three wide, or people that seem to not 
be handling well, i.e. mechanical issues, etc. 
 
 
Coordinating with on track officials too if they noticed anything 
Scanning from the front of the field to the back, then back to front: but as get 
closer to end of race, try to focus more towards the front 
But as race director you cannot focus on only one spot or car – you have to 
multitask – being able to listen to radio, someone talking to you in person, and 
also looking at what’s going on the track and thinking about what’s going next 
Environment changes constantly – whether its weather, timing, drivers, track etc. 
– so have to be able to make split second decisions: but that’s why it’s important 
to have a good base or benchmark, so you’re reacting to a ‘curveball’ instead of 
something that regularly happens 
 
[30:45] 
Out of Season Activities and Continued Discussion of Challenges of Being a 
Series Race Director 
General review of policy and procedures, facility upgrades, proposals, ideas, etc. 
in the off season 
Participating in car shows, mall shows, etc.  
Description of challenges of being a series race director including having to 
adapt to different track lengths, widths, and ones that are flat or high banked 
(e.g. flat track somewhat lower speed, so little more leeway in terms of being able 
to wiggle to see about a caution) 
Deferring to safety and making call for caution in a high bank track all the time, 
where little more leeway for flat track 
Challenge of going to different tracks and working with promoters at different 
tracks in a collaborative way, and being able to bring in your ‘program’ as it 
might be slightly different from  
Challenge of traveling series also going in and you are kind of ‘taking someone’s 
position’ for that one night re: track officials, so it’s important to blend into the 
staff and officials already at the track rather than steamrolling or overpowering 
anything 
 
[35:00]  
Challenges at a Weekly Track & Enjoyment in the Weekly Track 
 
 
Weather can be one of the big challenges in being race director at weekly track 
 
 
Outside series coming in too can be difficult 
Less challenges though at a weekly track, as you have your base established 
week in week out, unlike with series where it’s always different as always at 
different tracks 
Pride in being able to run an entertaining, enjoyable, and efficient show every 
week is where you find enjoyment as race director: and being able to sense that 
excitement and entertainment in fans and as a staff 
Drivers and teams, and working with them, is what keeps him going as a race 
director in terms of enjoyment 
Reflections on difference between Dirt and Asphalt – if you go see 10 races, you’ll 
probably get at least 8 out of 10 quality races on Dirt, but with Asphalt you’ll 
only see 2 out of 10 quality races, but that might be the best race you’ve ever 
seen: so in John’s opinion Dirt Tracks are more consistent in being entertaining 
Difference in asphalt and dirt teams, with the ‘haves and have-nots’ – that 
especially on asphalt, feels that inequality is more prevalent than in dirt 
23 Tracks are member tracks of DIRTcar Northeast so follow those rules, but 
weekly tracks can do some stuff slightly different but then with the DIRTcar 
Northeast comes through that takes precedence in terms of rules 
 
[41:05]  
Advice for Prospective Track Officials 
Get involved with the team in someway, whether it’s a pit team or a track 
official, and just listen and absorb everything and get that feel for knowing 
what’s going to happen next, at that local weekly level 
Move up through the local weekly track 
Reflection on dirt tracks not being a ‘not for profit’ – at the end of the day they 
are a business to make the owner / promoter in the black when they leave: so 
some decisions influence that too 
Example of a question about difference in question between if a track can run, 
and if it can run and make its money back that night (e.g. being able to cover all 
operations / facility / staffing costs), and trying to make that call ahead of time 
and not when people are showing up to the track 
Description of how there are three ‘points’ to a race track – that there are 
 
[44:25]  
Closing Reflections 
 
 
Being thankful for being able to work in something that he loves (motorsports) 
Description of the nickname ‘Left Turn Johnny’ and its origins in Lancaster, with 
John growing up around drag racers who used to rib him that the oval track 
racing he liked (dirt and asphalt) was boring because it was always “left, left, 
left” and his ‘counter’ to that ribbing
