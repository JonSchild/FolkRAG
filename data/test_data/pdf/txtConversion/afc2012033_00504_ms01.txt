HH: Okay. It’s April 3rd, 2013. This is Hannah Harvester with TAUNY and I’m in the home of Doug Moser. 
Patty Beyer is also here. We will be speaking about their farm operation. Could we start, could both of 
you just give a little personal history, where you grew up, and then we’ll talk about the current 
configuration of this farm. Just a little personal history, maybe your education. 
PB: You go first and I’ll go after you. 
DM: I’m Doug Moser and my education is just through high school. I came back to the farm, in fact I 
lived here all my life in this same house. I was married in 1976, no longer married anymore but have five 
children, which one of them is with me on the farm.  
PB:  And I’m Patty Beyer and I grew up outside of Rochester, New York. Let’s see, went to Canton 
College for two years then the University of Georgia. Then I worked for the Farm Service Agency for a 
short period of time. Then was employed with Cornell Cooperative Extension for 15 years. Then left 
extension to dairy farm.  
HH: Okay. And when was that that you left Extension?  
PB: 1999. 
(0:01:52)  
HH: Doug, could you tell me a little bit of the history of this farm? 
DM: Okay. My grandfather purchased it in 1923 with his wife Emma. He owned it by himself until 1954 
and my father who was Ellis and my mother Joyce and his wife Joyce went into partnership with their 
brother Elton and there was a three-way partnership from 1954-1960. Then my father’s brother left in 
1960 and my dad and my grandfather Andrew were in partnership until 1962. Then in 1981, I purchased 
it with my wife Sandy at that time, ‘til 1991 we were in partnership with my father and my mother 
Joyce. It was until 1991, yeah. Then I owned it by myself after my divorce in 2000—2009. Then Patty and 
my son Andrew and myself from 2009—the present. That’s the dates. Tell me what more you want to 
know. 
(0:03:28)  
HH: Can you talk about— so you grew up here on the farm. What year were you born?  
DM: ’55. 
HH: Can you talk about how you decided to—did you always know you were going to work on the farm? 
How did you come back to the farm?  
DM: I just really loved farming, animals, dairy cattle. And I just never thought that I would want to do 
anything else. It was just in my love for animals. 
HH: Okay. When you were growing up, how large was the farm? 
DM: It was 100 milk cows when I was growing up. 
HH: Okay. So how old were you when you purchased the farm in 1981? Had you been working on it prior 
to that? 
DM: Yup. I was here all my life. 
HH: Okay. So you never left. 
DM: Never left. 
HH: Okay, well that’s great because one of the things we’re interested in hearing about is changes on 
farms. So you’ll really be able to talk about that, I think. 
DM: So from 1955 when I was born to ’81, I guess when I went into partnership, owner how many years 
is that? 
PB: 26. 
DM: 26. Probably I was 26 years old when I went into partnership. 
PB: (laughs) You better do the math. 
(0:05:04)  
HH: So how did you come to join the partnership, Patty? 
PB: I had worked with Cooperative Extension and with Doug and Sandy years ago. I have always had a 
love for farming ever since I was a kid, been involved with agriculture since I was about eight years old. 
Decided to make the change. 
HH: Did you actually grow up on a farm? 
PB: No, I didn’t actually grow up on a farm, but I worked on one. Started with horses when I was eight, 
then dairy cattle when I was 13. 
HH: Did you grow up in an agricultural area? 
PB: I did from 13 on. Previous to that we lived in the city and my parents would take me out to places 
where there were horses that I could ride and work with. And then we moved out to the country when I 
was 13. And that’s when I got involved with dairy farming.  
HH: Okay. So you sort of made a decision that you wanted to go into farming and you knew Doug 
already. It just sort of worked out. 
PB: I knew I always wanted to dairy farm. And then just when I met up with Doug and Sandy they 
provided an opportunity to make that happen.  
HH: Okay. So do you live nearby? 
PB: About ten miles away. 
(0:06:25)  
HH: Just so we get this for the record can you describe what your farm looks like today in terms of 
number of animals, what systems you use for milking, for manure all that kind of stuff? 
DM: Presently we have 600 dairy milk cows. And approximately 600 animals that are not milking. Some 
of them animals that are not milking are located at— Andrew has a different location, lives at a different 
place. Four miles away. Some of them are there and some of them are at Patty Beyer’s place. She has 
some of the younger animals also. 
PB: The main herd, all the milking animals are here and all the young stock are housed at Andrew’s or 
my place.  
HH: Okay. And this is, by the way, this is the Town of Denmark, is that right? 
DM: Yeah. Actually the house is in the Town of Harrisburg and the barn is in Denmark. 
HH: Okay, so you have the milking animals here. 
DM: Then as far as— we grow all of our own crops but don’t grow any of our own grain. We rent 
probably a third of our acres. We’re milking in a milking parlor, where cows come to you. Manure is in a 
lagoon, it’s liquid.  
PB: Cows and young stock are housed in free stalls. 
HH: So all your animals are in free stalls. 
PB: Yeah, for the most part. 
(0:08:33)  
HH: And what crops do you grow? 
DM: Grass and alfalfa. And corn. Silage I guess I should say. 
HH: So are you purchasing grain, then? 
DM: Yes, we purchase grain. 
HH: Okay so you have— what kind of silo do you have?  
DM: We just have a silo for grain at the present.  
PB: And we have bunker silos for the forage. 
HH: And so your cows are in the barns year-round. They’re not going out to pasture. 
DM: Correct. 
(0:09:30)  
HH: And are all the acres together that you’re growing or are you renting in different parts of the— 
DM: Renting in different parts. Some next to Patty’s, some next to Andrew’s. So probably within in a ten 
mile radius.  
PB: That’s what I was going to say. 
HH: How many acres would you say you have? 
DM: Owning and renting are 1,200.  
(0:10:00)  
HH: Could you talk a little, Doug about how you, since you grew up on this farm, how you learned— 
what chores you started out with and maybe when you knew that you wanted to be a farmer. How you 
learned how to be a farmer. 
DM: I guess I remember when, this is when I was really little when they did all dry little square bales of 
hay. And they would roll the bales—I wasn’t very old—into a row so they could be picked up with a 
hayloader, which would be fastened on the side of a truck. And it would go along and the bales would go 
up the hayloader and someone would stand on the truck and place them to bring them to the barn. 
Then I remember corn silage was— a small amount of corn silage took a couple wooden silos. That was 
put in them silos. And I guess as far as why, I just really enjoyed being around. Probably more than the 
crop part of it, I enjoyed being around cows. And as I grew older I was able to get a— I don’t know how 
old I was— I was able to get a calf to show at the fair. And that just got me started. And I really enjoyed, 
I was just just proud that I was able to recognize an animal and remember her if she was missing or 
something—they were out to pasture back then, so. It was a whole different, it was more of a grazing, 
all but in the wintertime. 
(0:12:00) 
HH: Were you showing— was that through 4H? 
DM: Yes, yes. It just got me interested in higher quality, caliber of animals. Not that it was any better 
financially for us but it just interests me. 
HH: Did you have Holsteins? 
DML: Yes, all Holsteins. 
HH: And what is your stock today. Is it from the original Holsteins or have you been buying other 
animals? 
PB: You think there are any originals here? Maybe daughters way way back when. 
DM: I guess as we expanded we had to buy animals from other places, yes. And at this point we don’t 
have to purchase any, we can raise our own replacements.  
HH: Are you still— when it comes to breeding— are you still taking that care and thought or is it too 
many animals? 
DM: We still obviously artificially inseminate total. We have no bulls. But I would say that the integrity, 
with the numbers we’re more geared towards production of milk rather than pretty looking animals, I 
guess. 
HH: So when you were showing as a boy, that’s what the judging was done based on appearance. Not 
necessarily the qualities that would make a good production animal. 
DM: More so, yes. And we did some embryo transplanting. Different things that…we just couldn’t keep 
up with all the expenses in that area so we went towards milk production and doing better at that. 
(0:14:08)  
HH: Okay. Can you talk about some of the major changes that have occurred on the farm in your time.  
And I’m particularly— was there a moment, maybe when you realized when you had to really expand. 
When did that expansion start and what changes did that bring with it? 
DM: I guess we struggled financially soon after I got into partnership in ’81. I guess that’s when Patty 
started to help us. Cause she was working with Cooperative Extension in the business part of it.  
PB: That was in the mid to late nineties. It wasn’t soon after ’81.  
HH: Okay. 
DM: It was a little later than that. I think because there were two families we were supporting, 100 cows 
was not enough in our situation to financially— none of us worked off the farm. My mother and my wife 
both worked on the farm, therefore there was no income but from the cows. So that was a big— I would 
say the most difficult time for us. 
HH: Okay. And so it was working with Cornell that you determined that you needed to expand. 
DM: Yes. Patty, I think, sent us to Western New York to look at different types— we were in a tie stall 
barn at that time— look at different types of housing and milking parlor. And being able to move from 
tie stall to free stall. We drew up a plan that we could do that. Then we increased to probably 200 cows 
in our free stall. But it’s really been much better since we went from 400 to 600 cows. It was still a 
struggle at 200 cows. But now we’ve got so we can be more independent, and doing our own cropping. 
PB: It was the whole economies of size as time went on and your cost of production stayed the same, or 
went up, and your price of milk is always status quo. It didn’t follow in similar balance as to what it cost 
to produce a hundredweight of milk. Part of that has driven this farm and a lot of other farms in Lewis 
County or the dairy industry in general to go away from the tie stalls, and the handle-free stalls now with 
more animals and you gain in the economies of scale because you’re so much more efficient. What used 
to take you 2 and a half hours to milk 110 cows or three hours you can do that in what, 40 minutes or 
less? 
DM: Probably. 
PB: So there’s a whole efficiency thing that comes from going from the way farms used to be years ago 
as to where they are today. 
DM: The milk price hasn’t increased comparable with expenses.  
PB: And some of the things I think that, at least I’ve seen over the years, was back in the mid ‘90s when 
he first went to Western New York, western New York has been doing this, or probably other parts of 
the United States, housing cattle in free stall and handling more animals, Lewis County was kind of 
behind the times or slower to change. And that of course has changed here in the last 15-20 years.  
(0:18:00)  
HH: So is the main reason that you go to free stall space? Is it that you can house more or is it— okay 
your animals are here and then you can move them to the parlor for milking and that increases 
efficiency? 
PB: It’s the whole— the animals are able to come to be milked and you have a setup where you can milk 
thirty cows at once or one person can do it. You could never do that in a tie stall because you always had 
to individually go to the animals.  
DM: And feeding the cows. I can drive through the barn with a tractor and a big mixer wagon and feed a 
lot of cows within a few minutes. It’s just so much more efficient. Rather than using wheelbarrows, 
which we used to use. Or small cart or some sort. And silos were, this is my opinion, are slower to get 
forage out of a silo it takes a while. But silo unloaders with a big bucket on a big pay loader, you can load 
really fast and get a lot of silage fast to feed the cows. 
PB: There’s just some things I can think of. Like when you, we used to let cows here every day just to 
watch, let ‘em out on the pads and watch them for heat and that was letting, how many cows out that 
you had to manually unlatch and let them out. Stand there and watch them for a little bit and then— 
DM: To see if they were timing up for insemination. And now they’re walking around all the time, you 
can visually see them without doing anything, just walking through the barn. And just the whole way we 
handle that too. The animals are somewhat synchronized to monitor to breed them at the appropriate 
time. 
HH: Are you doing that by medication or is that just— 
DM: Medications. 
HH: So you are doing that hormonally, okay. All of them or? You said they were pretty much 
synchronized, so it’s not an exact— 
PB: Oh, it’s exact. There’s a timeframe that they have to have their shots given and— 
DM: —They’re inseminated at a certain time. 
HH: Okay so you have it so you have a certain number calving each month so it’s evenly spread out. 
DM: Yup. You have to be really efficient about— if a cow isn’t— if you can’t get cows to calve 
consistently, obviously production drops down. If they’re not calving within every 13 months or so, the 
cow obviously doesn’t give as much milk over that period time. Am I saying that right, I think so. 
(0:21:11)  
HH: So you have one free stall barn here on this property and then two others on the other two 
properties? Is that right? 
PB: Yeah. 
HH: So when did you put in the free stall? 
DM: The first one was 2000. For 200 cows. And then we added on— 
PB: 2009. 
DM: —in 2009. I guess it would have been 400 more. 
HH: Okay. And your milking parlor is— 
DM: You want to know how big it is? It started out as a double eight, which means eight on each side. 
And then we expanded it to a double eleven, maybe two years ago. Now we’re in the process of 
expanding it to a double 15.  
PB: So they’ll come in a 30 cows will get milked at once.  
HH: For your milking, are you milking three times a day? 
DM: Yes. 
HH: And how long is each— 
DM: At the present time they’re milking around the clock, two twelve hour shifts. And that should be 
more efficient because that gives us the opportunity if we want to milk more cows we can within a 24 
hour we can, with a double 15.  
HH: So there are two twelve hour shifts, that’s— 
DM: Two people. For each twelve hours. 
HH: So you have four milkers? 
DM: Yes. 
HH: And are the milkers primarily milkers or do they— 
DM: Primarily milkers. That’s all they do. And I have one more Hispanic. 
HH: So all your milkers are Hispanic? 
DM: Yes.  
HH: Okay. Go ahead, sorry. 
DM: One more Hispanic that does a lot of tractor driving and is very efficient. He can milk cows if we 
happen to need him. He can do anything, I guess. 
PB: He’s an all-around kind of a guy. 
DM: Then we have Patty’s son, David does a lot of the work at her place. Takes care of the heifers and 
he has another side job at the present. And maybe a little other part—time help, a few hours once in a 
while. 
HH: And what does Andrew’s— Can you sort of talk about the division of labor between the three 
owners? How is that all— how is the work divvied up? 
DM: You go ahead. 
PB: I’ll start with myself. I take care of feeding the baby calves. I take care of our fresh heifers and our 
fresh cows. I do all the financial work here, the bookkeeping. The statements and stuff for the bank and 
work with the lenders. And I help with fieldwork when it gets that time or year and where ever else I’m 
needed. 
DM: I guess I don’t know what I do (laughs). I feed all the cows, I guess that’s the biggest thing. And the 
heifers at my son’s farm, I go out there and feed them. And I guess I do quite a bit of planting and 
whatever else needs to be done, odds and ends.  
HH: Okay. And what does Andrew do? 
PB: He’s pretty well responsible for the dairy herd, the reproduction, working with the vet, the feed and 
nutrition, developing the rations. 
DM: The computer work out in the barn. 
PB: Yeah, he takes care of all the dairy record keeping. We have a Dairy Comp 305 program. He does all 
of that. Does all the data and runs the reports for us. He’s the computer guru guy. 
HH: Okay. So what is your computer system, is it— Do the cows have those bracelets— 
PB: Oh no. Not yet. 
DM: They will have a thing in your ear. What do you call them? 
PB: RFID tags. 
DM: And that will be in the new system in a couple months. 
HH: Okay. 
PB: So we’ll have daily milk weights on those animals. 
DM: Not yet, but we will have. 
HH: So right now he’s entering that stuff manually.  
PB: We have Dairy One come and do our testing once a month. And they’ll come and test once a month 
and then they’ll enter that weight into the computer for us. And then any herd health issues, like vet 
checks or sick cows or mastitis, calvings, Andrew does all that. 
DM: He enters them individually, right? 
PB: Yup. He keeps track of inventory, he knows where every cow is at. 
DM: He does the CAFO part of it too. If we have another person that helps, obviously he gives them the 
records.  
PB: Andrew does our— he’s our fixit guy. 
HH: He works on the machinery. 
PB: If something breaks, we call Andrew.  
HH: Okay. 
PB: He helps with planning and crop work too. We all kind of do. 
DM: Don’t give him too much—! (laughs) 
PB: All three partake in decision making. We all share equally in what happens around here. 
(0:26:51)  
HH: Hoes does that work? Is it basically by consensus? Do you generally feel like you see eye to eye on 
things? 
PB: Yeah, for the most part. 
DM: We work on it ‘til we do and make a decision. I would pretty much say consensus. 
PB: I think we’re similar all three of us, I think we’re all of us pretty conservative about how conservative 
or risky we would want to be on some things. I think we all come together and are very similar in that 
regard. And I think that probably Andrew might be, because he’s younger, might want to push harder 
and be more aggressive at something, but as we explore and talk about it and get advice from some 
other folks, it always seems we come to a mutual agreement between the three of us. 
( 0:27:35)  
HH: How old is Andrew? 
DM: He was born in ’78. 
HH: So early thirties. 
PB: 35 or something like that, isn’t he? 
HH: Does he have a family? 
DM: Yup, he has a wife and two children.  
HH: And so is she, is she involved in the farm at all? 
DM: No. 
HH: Does she have another job? 
DM: Not at the present. 
HH: Raising the children. 
DM: Just taking care of the children. 
HH: And did he— has he been working on the farm his whole life? 
DM: He went to college. He went to Cobleskill then Cornell for two years at the end. He worked off the 
farm for a year or so and he wanted to come back. 
HH: Were you expecting that? 
DM: Not really, no. I didn’t know for sure, but I’m happy he did. 
HH: So when did he join up? Maybe you already told me that. 
DM: No, I didn’t. Do you know what year he came back? 
PB: What’s thirteen minus ten. 
HH: Three. 
PB: (whispers) 2003. 
DM: Yeah, probably it was some where’s around 2003. I think he’s been— that sounds close. 
(0:29:05)  
HH: So how would you say— let me ask this first. Can you talk through season by season what the main 
tasks are on the farm? Or if season by season doesn’t work, maybe month by month, however you 
envision it. 
PB: Season by season might be better. Shall we start with winter? There’s never a dull moment, how’s 
that. You’d think winter we’d have it easier. Winter’s about feeding cows and getting chores done.  
DM: Planning for the spring.  
PB: We do a lot of financial stuff. The first of the year we have a financial consultant that meets with us 
and the bankers we meet with at least twice a year. Just to keep them abreast of what we have planned. 
Meetings. There’s a lot of meetings in the wintertime that we attend. To keep us updated and see 
what’s new. That kind of thing. 
HH: Meetings with other farmers or with Cornell kind of stuff? 
PB: It might be sponsored by Cornell or by an agribusiness but with other farmers. Then we have a 
managers discussion group that we seem to meet with more in the wintertime. That’s a group of 
farmers that get together. We might have a couple topics of interest that we talk about.  
DM: I think we make sure equipment is ready to go for the spring. We work on some of that or have 
somebody else work on it. Then spring, obviously we have to prepare ground for planting. Some grass 
seed, roughly 100 acres of grass seed, probably 600 acres of corn silage. Then I guess next is harvesting 
your hay; alfalfa grass.  
HH: You have a spring harvest? 
DM: It starts about the 25th of May. It probably takes four or five days. Really intense because you want 
to get the quality. And that’s every— what is it, four weeks after that? Another two times after that. So 
three times and once in a while you get some fourth. And the corn obviously isn’t harvested until 
probably middle of September. And that probably takes three weeks.  
PB: And then if we do anything with high-moisture shelled corn, that will take all the way through 
middle of November, if not later. 
DM: We do buy in our grain. Shelled corn. We have to truck that from wherever we get it from. We have 
the trucks but that takes time then too. That happens after that, for a month or so after October 1st. 
October to November.  
PB: And in between all this we have our, I don’t want to call it daily, but we have bedded packs that have 
to be cleaned, cows that have to be bedded, calves that have to be moved, dehorned, where they stay 
cleaned out, that kind of thing. So there’s always something rolling every day. 
DM: So I guess that brings us back to winter. After fall, that’s when the harvesting of the corn is, in the 
fall.  
(0:32:55)  
HH: How would you say the knowledge and skills that you’re using, throughout the year, how would you 
say those have changed over time as your operation has changed? Or have they? 
DM: I think the biggest thing that I’m not up on is the computer. To me anyways, everything’s kept track 
of on computers, where all the time I was in charge it was a sheet of paper. Keep track of all the cows on 
a sheet of paper and notebook or something, you know? And even the finances are all computerized 
now, that Patty takes care— 
PB: And then the whole decision making process seems quicker. There’s never a dull moment where you 
have to figure something out. If it isn’t finances or whether you can afford to buy a new— there’s hardly 
a day where there isn’t some sort of decision that has to be made. You know what I’m trying to say? It 
seems like it is faster and quicker and all the more important that the decision is right ‘cause the cards 
are so much higher now that what they used to be. 
DM: I would agree. 
PB: And we have, we got people issues that we never had to deal with. That as one of the biggest 
changes that I remember when we went from the 110 cows into the free stall and started having more 
people around. Now there’s more people management then there ever used to be.  
HH: Do you mean in terms of workers on the farm or also with different people you’re consulting? 
DM: Workers on the farm. 
PB: And just agribusiness in general. There’s just more of it, more of ‘em. 
HH: You mean like, machinery sales... When you say agribusiness are you talking about the grain people 
and the machinery people? 
PB: Feed salesman, machinery, financial consultants, the bankers. 
DM: We have a consulting firm— what is the right word for feeding cows? 
PB: A nutritionist. 
DM: A nutritionist that comes very frequently. 
PB: Our veterinarian who is here at least once a week. So there always seems to be something. And I 
think you have to be in tune to it and stay abreast of it, otherwise I think you can fall back farther than 
you could have 20 or 30 years ago, ‘cause it just seems everything is so much faster, rapid change.  
HH: Do you find it stressful? 
DM: Yes. 
PB: Oh yes. I said this past winter, there’s just not a day when we can just farm.  
DM: It’s changed, yeah. 
HH: But you sort of felt like you had— did you foresee the stress increasing when you chose to increase 
your numbers? Or is it just sort of— 
DM: I think it’s probably like that even if you didn’t have the numbers. Even if you had smaller. It’s just 
that everything has to progress. Production has to be more. Everything has to click in order for you to 
survive anymore. 
HH: So it comes back to the milk prices. 
PB: The industry. It’s just how the industry is. 
DM: I think it probably like that with a lot of industry. You have to perform or you’re not there. 
Performance, however you rate that in whatever business you’re in. In farming it has to be production, 
in dairy cows. And the expenses have to be regulated. You can’t get too high on expenses. 
PB: I wonder if the margin is so much different than what it was in the ‘70’s and ‘80s, it’s so much 
smaller. 
DM: That’s true. 
(37:00) HH: So if I’m prying too much you don’t have to answer, but I’m curious how you’re— all the 
mention of bankers and the financial consultants, how tight are things? Are you carrying a lot of debt? 
How does that all— when you’re talking about all these upgrades when you’re upgrading the systems, 
clearly you’re making calculations. 
DM: You can tell her that. 
PB: Well, this updating thing and we’re making calculations, anything that we do here, we run the 
numbers on to see if it makes sense, if we can pay for it or not. And if we’re going to get a pound or two 
more of milk. And then as far as like, are we carrying a lot of debt, we’re probably average.  
DM: What’s the proportion of equity to debt? 
PB: For us, we own maybe 50% of the business that we own. And we have debt per cow, 3,700 at this 
point. And I think industry average is like 25-35 they like it. Per cow. 
(0:38:11)  
HH: So is the idea that, I apologize for my ignorance, this is something I’ve just never quite understood, 
perhaps it’s because I don’t have a firm grasp on economics. So you’re carrying this debt per cow but the 
idea is that you’re building wealth? How does it work that you can carry this debt? 
PB: We generate enough revenue minus our expenses to cover the debt. We’re at a place where we can 
handle it. And there’s parameters that if we feel like we get up to like 4 or $5,000 debt per cow then it’s 
all the more difficult and the more aggressive we have to be to perform to be able to cover that debt. So 
with that debt structure that we have right now, we’re able to pay our operating expenses and our living 
and pay principal off on our debt payments which allows us to grow. Then if we have to borrow back— 
we have the ability to borrow to continue to grow to build the business all the greater. (to Doug) Right? 
Is that how it works? Don’t you think? 
DM: Yeah. That’s your expertise. 
PB: But you know all it takes is a year where the price of milk— like in 2009, you could have been in 
2008 functioning okay in the dairy industry with 3,700 debt per cow, and then 2009 the price of milk just 
tanked really, really bad and you had to go back to the bank and say, “I can’t even pay my operating 
expenses now.” And there was many dairies that did that. And I think for us we ended up borrowing 
$300,000 that year just to pay our bills. Whatever we gained, we lost. Now you try and earn it back and 
continue to hope that the price of milk and the cost of production would stay in line to allow you to do 
that. 
DM: So in that one year we went behind $300,000. 
PB: Yeah, and I forget how much, a thousand dollar a cow loss was like average for the United States 
that year, in 2009. So anyways, it’s the ups and the downs. 
DM: And you hope that there’s more ups than downs. 
HH: Uhuh. Sounds very stressful to me, but what keeps you— clearly you’re planning to stay in it and 
keep moving forward and keep growing the business. So you do have hope that it will— 
DM: But I think as a whole each one of us have set aside money for retirement because we have grown 
enough that our equity is more. Correct? 
PB: Yes, we’ve done well since the second expansion, 2009. We got it right, who knows about the 
economy or what, but that’s a nice fit for us right now. 
(0:41:13)  
HH: Can you talk a little bit about how as you’ve brought in new technology, like the new milking parlor 
or maybe other machinery that I haven’t really asked specifically about, your machinery that you use for 
cropping and things like that. Would you say these changes you’ve made have changed the nature of 
work on the farm? What it feels like to work on the farm, especially for you having been here your 
whole life.  
DM: I think where it used to take us to harvest hay a month to do one cutting, now it takes five days 
because the equipment is so much bigger and so fast. And you use trucks to haul it with and it’s faster 
that way. Yeah, it’s important to get it in within a period of time so the quality is right. So if the quality is 
good then cows obviously produce better. So that’s a huge change for me and what I’m accustomed to. 
Then also the keeping track of the— that cows have to calve every twelve or thirteen months and the 
programs they have to make sure that you do your best making that happen. That’s one of the changes. 
Equipment is obviously a lot bigger. And faster. You have anything to add? 
HH: I mean we’ve been sort of talking about that. You were talking about that you really like the animals 
and working with the animals and sounds like you’re caring for the young stock and some of the animals 
that are in the dry or— 
DM: Fresh. 
HH:—the fresh heifers and cows. For each of you, how would you describe your relationship to your 
animals? 
DM: Mostly one of the kids. 
PB: I say, I love ‘em. 
DM: For some reason you get really attached if one dies or something happens to one, it’s painful. But 
obviously it does happen. I would say that’s the way I feel. You grow attached. 
PB: You don’t want to call ‘em pets. 
DM: They’re really not pets. 
PB: Not pets, but it’s inherent in you, I think. 
HH: Do you have particular animals that you’re especially fond of? Are there ones that are more like 
almost pets. 
PB: Mhm. Yup. 
DM: I would say that for me it’s a number now than it used to be. Each cow. I don’t know each cow 
individually anymore. You just, right or wrong that’s what’s happened I guess. 
(0:44:34)  
HH: It’s interesting that you say, “Right or wrong that’s what happened.” Because my next question is 
looking at the changes that we’ve talked about, do you see you know, things that are positive or 
negative about the changes? What is your sort of attitude towards the changes, towards the changes 
that have been taking place? 
PB: From an animal standpoint, the changes have been more positive, don’t you think? 
DM: Mhm. 
PB: The health of the animal. They have better, more comfort, better ventilation. I think they were taken 
very well care of before and they’re taken extremely good care of now. The facilities allowed it. The 
people that we have around here that work with them are excellent with them. 
DM: They sleep on water beds, if that interests you (laughs). Everything, you have to make sure they’re 
comfortable, make sure there’s food in front of them all the time. 
PB: In the summertime we have a barn full of fans for ‘em. They get a shower to come out of the parlor 
to cool them off. They have it pretty good here. So that’s been definitely one of the positive changes. 
The case of the animals. And we see it I think, we’re three years coming around now, are we? In the 
barn? And we can see the difference. In the ones that were heifers when they freshened and they’ve 
come back around now a couple times now as cows. I think their longevity is better for us. That was 
certainly one positive thing, right? 
HH: How long— what is the normal lifespan of a milking cow? How long are they with you? 
PB: Five, maybe. 
DM: At the most, I would say. Four to five years. There’s a person that comes every other week to do 
their feet. I have certain programs that tell which ones, or even if we notice some that are not walking 
right. So there’s— 
(0:46:43)  
HH: Are any of these jobs where people are coming in, and any of them jobs where you actually did 
yourself or that —when it comes to hoof trimming or something. Was your father doing that or your 
grandfather or was it always a vet coming in or a hoof trimmer. 
DM: I guess I don’t remember that we did it too much anymore. Now we sense the importance of it, you 
know. That’s my inclination. Maybe one, once in a while but I don’t remember when I was young that 
they did it very much. 
HH: Okay. So it’s part of just maintaining their care. 
DM: It’s part of production, that, yeah. 
PB: Same with the vet coming. The vet used to come once a month. 
DM: Right. Now we do it every week. Examine them, see if they’re pregnant. And they do ultrasounds, 
they can do it so much quicker.  
(0:47:38)  
HH: I’d like to ask you a little bit about your Hispanic workers. Do you have other— you said there was 
people who maybe do odd things. 
DM: Her son, some. 
HH: How did you come to hire these workers? Did you have local labor before that? How did you come 
to hire on these workers? 
DM: Go ahead. 
PB: We had local. We had lots of part-time. 
DM: School. 
PB: School kids. 
DM: They were really good. They did well.  
PB: They did good. For the most part. 
DM: But they, I don’t know— 
PB: They might not be so consistent when we needed them to be. 
DM: And obviously it didn’t last very long and they were off to their own careers. 
PB: But they were good kids, when they were here. 
HH: But that was when you had fewer cows. 
(0:48:38) 
DM: Yes. Why did we go to— I guess, I don’t know why we did. Why did we get the first guy? 
PB: Probably some of those kids we got, they left or we were shorthanded and that’s when Dr. Thomas 
said, “Well, we don’t you try a Hispanic.” And we wound up with two instead of one. 
DM: That was really an experience. I remember picking— going to a farm to pick the first two up and 
obviously I couldn’t talk Spanish and they couldn’t talk English and they didn’t know where they were 
going when they got in the vehicle with me. It’s been really really good. One is still with us yet today, it’s 
been eight years. He went home once in between. I think he’s ready to go back again. Now we have— 
it’s worked the best for us that we’ve had, they find their own replacements kind of. Because they know 
who… they have family or friends that they know. 
PB: This was the first two that came. And how many years ago, you said eight? 
DM: Yeah, I think it’s eight 
PM: Yeah, Adolfo and Cosme. 
DM: Adolfo’s still here. 
PB: He’s phenomenal. He is unbelievable; he’s just smarter than a whip.  
DM: He just cares about each one of us, too. He’ll help us. He just never gets upset. None of them do, 
that I’ve seen. They just are happy. 
PB: So here’s gone and come back, once or twice? 
DM: Once. 
HH: Is he— where is he from Mexico or Guatemala— 
DM: Mexico. 
PB: Mexico.  
DM: They all are. 
PB: He left and Cosme came back once, right?  
DM: Not here, no. We didn’t have room for him.   
PB: (showing photos) This fella’s still with us, Alfonso. This was Juan. Good guys. 
DM: I don’t know if that answers what you were looking for but— 
HH: Yeah, yeah. And you said they live here in the house?  
DM: We have an apartment that we’re getting ready for them. It’s not ready yet. I sense that they would 
like to be by themselves some. And that would give us privacy here. And they would have a little more 
privacy. But we haven’t had any problems. They do the dishes every night for us. 
HH: So are you eating together? 
DM: No. Well, we do sometimes, but they make their own food and I make my own food or we do. It’s 
too hot for me to eat, their stuff. (laughs) 
HH: Are they— you mentioned that there’s two twelve hour shifts. Is that something that you all agreed 
on together. Are they happy with that? 
DM: Yeah, they’re happy with that. 
HH: To me it’s like oooh, a twelve hour shift. 
PB: I know, that’s what I say. 
DM: That’s what they wanted. They wanted to work twelve hour shifts. 
PB: We’ve asked before if they wanted to get someone else to give them a little bit of time off. And they 
said no. 
DM: I think they’re here to make money and send it home. And it’s amazing that the two or three of 
them have built some really nice houses back home. Both of them that I know haven’t seen their house, 
they’ve seen pictures of it. It’s amazing what it was before and what it is now. It makes me feel good 
that they spend it in a responsible way. They take care of grandma and their brothers and sisters. That’s 
something that maybe we don’t do here, I don’t do so well.  (to employees who’ve walked in) Youse guys 
gonna wanna talk here in a minute, Julio! That’s not his real name, what is his name? 
PB: Uriel. 
DM: Ur— 
PB: Uriel. 
HH: Uriel. 
PB: Can you speak Spanish? 
HH: Yes. 
PB: Oh good. 
DM: So that’s gonna be good for her. 
(0:52:34)  
HH: So how do you communicate with them? 
DM: Andrew speaks quite a bit of Spanish. 
PB: Between us all a little bit of Spanish for us and a little bit of English for some of them. And Andrew 
can speak. 
DM: (getting up) I don’t want those guys to get away, sometimes they— 
PB: This guy Adolfo speaks pretty good English and so does Alfonso. Enough to get us all by. And then 
there might be two others, like this young fella here, doesn’t speak very much English. And Abel he was 
learning— that’s Adolfo that just came in— taking English lessons and stuff here a while ago. 
HH: So are they in the same situation as others that I’ve talked to that they can’t leave the farm because 
they might get picked up. 
PB: There’s that risk, but these fellas do go to Wal-Mart in Lowville and they’ll go get Chinese in 
Carthage. They have a lady that drives them around, so they go back and forth a little bit. 
HH: And they haven’t run into any problems. 
PB: No problems yet. 
HH: That’s good. 
PB: Maybe we won’t have to worry about it here, shortly.  
HH: Yeah. 
PB: I’m hoping. So are they all done then?  Adolfo done for the day? 
DM: I told them they had to send them in. 
PB: Oh, okay. 
DM: I thought they might be in before this,  but. 
(0:53:59)  
HH: How do you get your milk to market? Are you with a co-op? 
DM: Yeah.  Lowville producers. It goes to Kraft, most of it. 
PB: For cream cheese. 
(0:54:20)  
HH: For both of you, what’s the most challenging thing about dairy farming? 
DM: I guess I would say, you’re responsible, maybe it is with any business you own yourself, but you’re 
responsible every day, seven days a week kind of. I like it and when you have time off you’re kind of 
anxious to get back. 
PB: The most challenging is just, everybody getting along. When you have so many different parameters 
going here. That’s a chore. You have to work at that.  
DM: It’s not fun when you don’t like each other. (all laugh) For a day or two. But it’s been good, I would 
say, as a whole. Once in a while there’s some yelling (Doug laughs) 
HH: What’s the most enjoyable or satisfying aspect? 
PB: I think part of it’s, the whole working with the animals. I mean I just find lots of, I like the animals. I 
like the baby calves. I like to pet them, I like to feed them, I like to take care of my fresh cows, I like to 
see a sick cow that starts to come along and ends up being okay. And then just to watch the business 
grow. Watch us work so hard and see where it’s been and where it’s coming to and where it might go. 
DM: You said it good.  
PB: You like to see the corn grow in the springtime. 
DM: Yeah, it is nice to see the crops grow. It’s nice to stand outside and look across the fields. 
PB: It’s nice to pull in and have it look pretty. (Patty and Doug laugh) I guess that’s why we do it.  
DM: Mow the lawn and stuff, just like anybody’s house I guess. 
HH: Do either of you have a favorite season on the farm? 
PB: Certainly not winter. Spring and summer, fall. All three of them. Probably more summer and fall than 
spring. For me. What about for you? 
DM: I kind of like winter a bit just because I like it when it slows down a little bit. It just doesn’t seem to 
be so tense. 
(0:56:57)  
HH: Do you feel proud to be dairy farmers? 
PB: Absolutely. 
DM: Yeah, I’m happy to be. Maybe you’ll want to come back! (laughs) 
(0:57:20)  
HH: Maybe. What do you see the role of your farm in the larger community?  
PB: I think it’s pretty important. Not just us individually but all the other farmers— the whole agriculture 
industry right here in Lewis County. We all play a pretty important part in making the county is what it is. 
Because it’s the predominant industry in Lewis County. 
HH: Have you seen that change or do you think it’s still— would you say agriculture is still as strong as it 
was when you were growing up? Or as important? 
(0:58:00) 
DM: I think, I don’t know that it’s changed; I think it was important when I was young and I think it still 
is. I feel that way. The importance of it is still very similar. 
HH: For either of you, I’ve been asking this of everyone and if it’s too private you can let me know. I’m 
just curious about whether you’re religious people and if so, if your faith plays any role in your decision 
to be farmers or the outlook that you take towards farming. 
DM: Yeah, for me it does. I like to— that’s why our employees we have, I like to make sure they are 
treated fairly and taken well care of. And that they enjoy life also. As far as animals, I don’t know how 
that— I think it all related somewhat that you’re blessed with the responsibility to take care of what you 
have. That’s the way I feel. Can you go next? 
PB: I think the same way. I think it goes beyond that in how we deal with other farmers, the land we rent 
from, agribusiness. 
DM: Honesty. 
PN: To be treated fairly, honestly. 
HH: What is your religion, for both of you? 
DM: I’m a Mennonite. 
PB: Catholic. 
DM: This is where Rosanna’s mother grew up, this house. 
HH: Yeah, she mentioned that to me when we— 
DM: Whether that interests you. 
(1:00:00) 
HH: Yeah. I think that’s all the sort of specific questions I have. Did I leave out anything important? Are 
there other things you’d like to mention for the record? Anything about your farm or your thoughts 
about farming in general in Lewis County or anything like that? 
DM: I think you did well with the questions. Hopefully it was helpful for you. 
HH: Yeah, yeah very much. 
DM: I think there was a— I don’t even know if I should say— there was a time when we didn’t know if 
we were going to be successful. It was kind of, I’m not sure what year that was. 
PB: In the early 2000s.  
DM: That was really scary, to know that I might be a failure. I guess it was more me. (to Patty) Youse 
were all helping me. 
HH: That was— was that after you had made the first expansion? 
DM: Yes. 
HH: So there was like a time of uncertainty. 
DM: With the help of everybody, I guess. And there was agribusinesses that worked with us. It wasn’t 
just on our own. They let us— extended credit to us and worked with us really hard to see that we 
would, hoping that it would turn out okay. 
PB: And we had FarmNet, out of Cornell. I don’t know if you’re familiar with that? 
HH: No. FarmNet. What is it? 
PB: They have like advisers that help with financial and personnel matters. Then they have a whole 
network of resources and people and attorneys and accountants to help you through when you’ve got 
some issues going on. 
DM: I don’t know how it’s paid for but it doesn’t cost us anything. And they still stop in and we got to 
even talk at one point at a meeting when all the agribusinesses must help support them.  
PB: They were real helpful. 
DM: Yup. They’re older men, at least in our situation.  
PB: They’ve helped us all the way up through. From the finances to personnel for the last ten or twelve 
years.  He just called us the other day to see how it’s going.  That was really good resource to use.  
DM: They’re out of— 
PB: Cornell. They’re housed at Cornell, funded by New York State and maybe agribusinesses. 
HH: I know you’re making some— you have some new changes coming in with new technology, what 
are your— do you plan to expand more? Do you have a long term plan or are you sort of taking it year 
by year. 
(1:03:16) 
PB: I think we’re gonna grow. We’ll grow again, but we’ve got some things to get in order, like getting 
the parlor updated. We’ve got some young stock housing issues down the road. 
DM: Everything snowballs. You have to make sure it’s— first financially, then it’s then you have to make 
sure you have enough land to, acres to feed the animals, labor, you have to make sure your labor is 
working well together.  
PB: It’s all got to come together or it won’t happen. 
HH: Do you—sorry  I said I had no more questions and I’m asking a couple more. Do you, I mean thinking 
back to when it was a hundred milkers and now— if the finances weren’t an issue and you could have it 
any way, do you prefer it like this on the bigger scale or did the smaller scale suit you better or is it just, 
it is what it is. 
DM: Yeah. I guess I wouldn’t want to go back t the way it was. I think this is probably more stressful 
mentally but physically the labor and stuff is so much easier. That’s the way I feel. 
PB: I feel the same way. Physically it’s not as tough. 
HH: Okay. I think that’s it for me. Thank you. 
DM: So you’re ready for them guys?
