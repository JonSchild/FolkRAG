THE MIRACULOUS OAK
In the month of April in the year 1895 near Leca do Balio an oak treewas uprooted during a violent
storm and carried to the middle of a fieldwhere it remained standing upright close to a stream.
This was taken bythe simple folk if the village for a miracle. Pilgrimages were organizedand the oak
reverenced as a Saint and the water of the nearby stream consideredmiraculous. The news of the
phenomenon spread rapidly and evenmany superstitious people from the city of Oporto joined
in the pilgrimagesto the village. So great was the gathering of the curious at thisspot that on one
day the crowd was estimated at eighty thousand. So greatwas the enthusiasm of the people that
they wanted to build a chapel on thespot and upon being stopped from doing so by the ecolesiastic
authoritiessome of them became hysterical and cut down parts of the tree to be preservedas relics.
It was said that when this was done blood ran from thetree and it was heard to cry out in a loud
voice: "Oh! you have crippledme". All this was the cause for much scoffing and derision among
the unbelieversand among the more educated and intelligent classes, and thefollowing song,
"THE MIRACULOUS OAK", was improvised (with all sort ofsuggestive verses), and sung through the
streets in mock pilgimages. Itbecame very popular and is still one of the most popular songs of
northernPortugal and is known and sung by the Portuguese in California.
