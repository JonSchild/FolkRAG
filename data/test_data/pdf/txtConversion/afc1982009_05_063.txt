Carl and I drove to the Kibler Valley to tape record and photograph Will 
and Ruth Ellen Barnard. I had talked to them previously and wanted to 
get his witch meliorates and legends on tape. We made five reels of tape 
on them today. The first two contain the witch legends, folk beliefs, 
and family history. The atmosphere was relaxed and informal as we sat 
in their living room and talked. Edgar Cassell, a Primitive Baptist 
preacher and friend and relative of the Barnards, came by for a visit, 
and we moved the microphones out to the front porch and continued taping 
the conversation. They talked mainly about religion, and Cassell told 
about his own religious conversion. These stories were very sincere and 
effective in evoking the sense of spiritualism of the experiences. After 
he left, a son-in-law of the Barnards came by, but we didn't get him on 
tape. He gave me a lead to a backwoodanan, Harrison Hensley, who lives 
off hiway 103. Hensley knows woods lore, herbs, and saw mill affairs. 
We recorded more of Will's family history and reminiscences about life 
when he was growing up. Off the tape, he mentioned the Devil's Footprint, 
a mark on Busted Rock near Meadows of Dan, and the Devil1 s Den below. 
Carl and I walked up the hill behind the house, and he took photos of 
the house, the valley, and the family cemetary. We then had supper 
with the Barnards, hone-cured ham, green beans, com, biscuits, tonatoes, 
cucumbers, and milk. We talked about foodways for awhile. Before 
supper, Carl took pictures of Ruth's quilts and crocheted covers. The 
order of photos is 1) "Trip Around the World" made of Ig" or 2" squares 
of polyester by Ella Collins, mother of Ruth Barnard; it was stitched 
by hand and made in rounds (rows). She started with 9" in the center. 
It was given to Ruth for her birthday. 2) "Grannie's Squares". Ella 
Collins made this one also by crocheting 65 or ?2 squares and then 
sewing the squares together. Again, it waa a birthday present. Mrs. 
Collins was in her 80's when these two were made. 3) Ruth had no name 
for this one; she made it in 1977 by crocheting 172 seven inch squares 
which were then sewed together. 4) She doesn't know the name of this 
design. It was hand woven by Will Barnard's aunt on her own loan; his 
mother spun the cloth for it. Will's mother gave it to him when he was 
15 or 16, which makes it about 70 years old.

I attended worship services at the Clark's Creek Progressive 
Primitive Baptist Church today. I arrived at 11 a.m., and 
bunday School lessons_were in progress in the basement of the 
uncompleted church building. I sat in on the adult class 
which was taught by Fred Brim who is also choir director. The 
class was discussing ways of relating to non-church members 
without offending them. The discussion was very open with 
several men and women making comments and some disagreement 
arising. The class ended a little before 11*30, and most of 
the people remained because the main service was also held in 
??ti:L the.comPletion of the upstairs chapel. More 
people gradually came in even after the service started. The 
first part of the service was conducted by an elder, Mr. Brim 
an uncle of Fred's, who led the opening player. There ^ere 
interjections from the congrgation during the prayer, amen, 
yes Lord, and.so forth. A hymn number was announced by Fred 
Iheir were only a few hymbooks available and most 
people sang without one. I never had the opportunity to look 
+iL?n®f.Ci?r;ely* The songs and singing style were similar to 
hat cu other olack Baptist'churches, Missionary and Regular 
which I have attended in Ohio cities. There was a caUand 
response pattern with a solo singer singing a line and the 
congregation responding^with a refrain. A gospel style piano 
played by Fred Brim's sister Doris accompanied the the singing. 
Fred also played at.times or they both played togethe?. ?wo & 
men and two women singers were featured soloists during the 
part of the service when the choir sang. The whole congregation 
a5d a member from the group would start them 
of-L. This seemed spontaneous and democratic; anyone, man or 
andadidnUdfeeirthatS°nf ‘ been placed near the front 
J^d.+ ? t feel note taking was appropriate so that I 
don t have any of the names of the songs. They sounded like 
cS?pW0Snd bL°ngS f°- th? m?St Part’ and the^ was muchhand 
clapping and body swaying to the music. Several songs were 
+hpeTH?-|the ?rntlre conSregation, and then Elder Brii/read from 
the Bible.# More songs were sung, and then there was a period 
of testifying. The first one to testify was Doris Brim, and 
as she spoke of the way Christ had helped her in a time of 
sh3 decame very emotional, crying and swaying back 
and forth. Other men and.women testified, rising spontaneouslv 
from where they were sitting, some were emotional and others 
Ve^'e>,n0+^, -^ter this there was more singing and another praver 
y t'16 Pa®tor, Elder James Strickland, who wore a long black 
robe and a metal cross on a chain around his neck. He came from 
v-MaCkT3r°°m at a p01nt ^ the service where he took over fror/ 
Elder Brim. He read a verse from the Bible and requested a song 
from the choir who were seated behing^him to his left; the 
piano was against the wall to his left. He read another 
Bible verse and started into his sermon. His voice would rise 
to emotional peaks at various points, but his style was 
generally not emotional nor especially rhythmic. The congre¬ 
gation responded with amens and yes Lord at various points. 
Throughout the service, during songs, prayers, sermon, testifying, 
the congregation was verbally expressive and very much involved. 
At the end of the sermon, he called for those who wished to be 
saved or reinstated in the church to come forward during the 
singing of a song, but no one came forward. Announcements were 
then.made.by Fred and Doris Brim about those who were sick, 
meetings in the area, church committee meetings, etc. Then 
Fred Brim introduced me and I said a few words about the project 
and our desire to photograph and record a church service. 
Fred in introducing me mentioned some work I had done in 
integrating schools, and there were amens to that. A few more 
songs were sung, and then there was a closing prayer. People 
began to talk and visit with one another as they slowly left 
the church. Several people came over to shake my hand and 
welcome me and invite me back. I met many of the elders and 
deacons and mothers of the church, and stood around outside and 
talked for about 15 minutes. The service was over at 1;30 
so that it took two hours altogether. As I drove away, many 
people were still standing in the church yard talking. 
I drove up to Meadows of Dan for lunch, and then drove back to 
Galax on side roads near the parkway looking at houses and 
looking for people who I might stop and talk to. It was a hot 
day and most people were in their houses.

I went on an exploratory drive along the eastern slope of 
the Blue Ridge in North Carolina. I went down Highway 89 into 
Surry County and then onto 1338. I noticed a bait shop on this 
road which I might return to to get fishing lore. I passed 
the Mitchell's River Primitive Baptist Church on 1330 on the 
way to Devotion. I stopped at the caretaker's house at the 
entrance to the Reynold's estate which is a game preserve no w. 
I talked to the caretaker’s wife, but she was not very helpful; 
she didn't really want to talk to me. I drove over into Wilkes 
County and up Highway 21 to 1002 and over to Traphill. I 
noticed a sign "quilts for sale" as I came into Traphill on 
1002 and stopped to talk to Florence E. Cheek (Star Route, Box 
9, Traphill, N.C., 28685; 957-2356). She makes quilts to 
supplement her social security income. Her husband, D.C., is 
retired and I also talked to him. She is 73 years old and has 
been quilting since she got married, and she says she makes 
them "old style." She was born and raised in Wilkes County 
and is a member of the Traphill Missionary Baptist Church. 
She showed me five quilts she made which ranged in price from 
$35 to $75 depending on how much time she spent of them. 
She identified the following designs« log cabin, fence row, 
bow tie, and x>ne that she said was similar to around the world. 
She said it took two weeks and ten yards of cloth to make the 
bow tie. We talked bbout religion for awhile, and she recounted 
her own born again experience in which she was praying in a 
tobacco barn and the barn lifted av/ay revealing a golden light 
which was heaven. Her belief is that baptism is not enough 
to be saved, you have to have the born again experience. When 
you are baptised without feeling the spirit, "You just go in a 
dry sinner and come out a wet one." I drove up 1737 and 1736 
which is a rugged, fairly isolated area at the foot of Doughton 
Park. The people looked at me suspiciously as I drove by. 
I got stuck in the mud, and went up to a house for help. The 
woman wouldn't talk very long and kept the door.locked. I 
went to another house where they lef me use their phone to call 
a tow truck. No one I talked to was very helpful. People 
did mention the name of Claude Kennedy who runs a craft shop in 
Traphill. The tow truck driver said Kennedy would be the best 
one to talk to. After getting the car out, I drvoe up 1730 
where I noticed a logging operation going on. Also, in the 
Traphill area there are many poultry farms. I drove back along 
the Blue Ridge Parkway and stopped at the craft shop and cabin 
in Doughton Park, no leads came from this. I took some scenic 
photographs from the Blue Ridge looking east into North Carolina.

Rusty and I drove out to the John Weatherman I-house on 6l4 
near Ararat in Patrick County, Va. We told Adam Clement that 
v/e would he documenting the house, and then we proceeded to 
measure and photograph it. Rusty explained the measuring 
techniques and what was important to measure. We did all of 
the rooms upstairs and down and then the two rooms in the 
addition in hack. We then measured the out buildings including 
the well house, the corn crih and the harn. Rusty also 
explained some techniques for dating buildings and for determining 
the tradition they come from. We also noted several interesting 
buildings on the ride out and back, especially on Highway 58 
between Hillsville and Laurel Fork. 
8/16/78 Pat Mullen 
My wife, Roseanne Rini, joined me on today's field trip. We 
drove down to Alleghany County, N.C. to see the Choates, a 
"black family that Gerri had talked to previously. We 
contacted the Choates at their home, and I filled out an 
interview form on Sabe Choate. His wife's name is Donna Greer 
Choate. Mr. Choate was born and brought up in this area and 
owns his own farm which he still runs at age 68. They are 
members of the Macedonia New Covenant Baptist Church where 
Reverend G.P. Gentry is pastor and his assistant is E.R. Young. 
They have a piano and gongregational singing, and the choir 
directors name is Juanita Bryan. He also recommended that I 
talk to Deacon Walter Brown about church history. Mr. Choate 
heard his father talk about the Civil War and his grand father 
talk about slavery, but he doesn't remember apy of it. Both 
his grandfathers were Slaves. His mother was a Thompson, and 
they were from Surry County. The Choates and Thompsons got 
together at the New Home Baptist Church which is near the county 
line. He talked about the Choate family graveyard at the 
crossroads near has house; his grandfather was the first to be 
buried there in 1917. He built his own house in 1937 with no 
plans. He got his first tractor 20 years ago and before that 
used horses. He uses planting signs which he gets off a 
calendar which he bought at the hardware store in Sparta. He 
mentioned corn shuching, music, and said he had heard of witches 
but didn't want anything to do with that. He said that 
relations with whites were "nice". "We get along good." He 
did complain about the fact that black children used to have to 
walk miles to school while the white children rode buses. 
I took photographs of him on the front porch and working on his 
tractor mowing one of his pastures. 
We drove into Sparta for lunch, and I looked for the planting 
signs calendar at two stores, but they were sold out. We then 
went by Juanita Bryans place to see about attending a church 
service at Macedonia. She was leaving and didn't have time to 
talk, but she said we would be welcome at the church service. 
She also sold me a copy of a book on the New Covenant church 
history: Mark Sexton, The Chalice and the Covenant. Hunter 
Publishing Co., Winston-Salem, N.C., 1976. I got her phone 
number and will call to make an appointment to see her later. 
We went to Walter Brown's house and talked to him and his wife 
Vivian for several hours. They have ten children only one of 
whom js living at home. He is a deacon of the Macedonia church 
and said that it is the second oldest of the New Covenant. His 
parents and grandparents were also members. Walter is a retired 
coal miner; he lived for 30 years in West Virginia working in 
the mines and then came back home to Alleghany County to retire. 
He now runs his own small farm. He has the old minutes of the 
church going back to the 1890's. I took photographs of several 
of these. I filled out interview forms on him and his wife. 
He recommended that I talk to Dean Gambill who is in his 80's 
and knows the history of the area. Walter remembers the old 
people talking^about slavery; the slaves were driven up and down 
the mountain like cattle. A baby was crying and bothering the 
whites and they took the baby and killed it. His aunt used to 
tell him about slavery. He said that they have foot washing at 
his church, and that we would be welcome to attend. He said 
race relations were generally good, but he mentioned that the 
barber shop in Sparta will not cut black people's hair and that 
he has to go to a barber shop run by blacks in Galax. He showed 
me a copy of the History of Alleghany County which can be 
purchased at the court house in Sparta, He and his wife gave 
us some corn, squassh, tomatoes, and peppers out of his garden, 
and I took photographs of them picking and cutting vegatables 
in their garden. He then took us down to his hog pen, and I 
took pictures of him slopping the hogs. I t gave him great delight 
to think that pictures of him slopping hogs would be in the 
Library of Congress. 
After we left the Browns, we drove to the Macedonia Church and 
took pictures of the graveyard and surrounding scenery.

Blanton, Harley Jolly, a Park Service intern, and I went to 
check out a storyteller, Herbert Fulk in Toast, N.C., who 
Blanton had heard some men talking about as a charcter and 
storyteller. After a search of the area we finally found his 
house, a run-down double pen house with junk piled in the 
yard and inside. The house was dirty and so was Herbert Hoover 
Fulk, but he was friendly and willing to talk to us. He started 
right in with a story of how he owned Charlie Lawson's gun 
and^gramophone. Charlie Lawson was a man who murdered his 
family and the^subject of a ballad. Herbert showed us the gun 
with marks on it where Charlie hit his wife and the gramaphone 
with her blood stains on it. We took photos of Herbert, the 
gun, the gramophone and his house. We started up the tape 
recorder shortly after we arrived because we realized he was a 
good talker and story teller; we did three reels of tape and 
filled out an interview form on him. He is a strange man, 
and it was easy to see why he had built up a reputation as a 
character; he said that the sheriff had come out to take him 
to the insane asylum, but he had talked him out of it. Herbert 
told a whole series of personal experience stories about his 
encounters with ghosts, and he told them with conviction and 
sincerity. He is a good story teller; he dramatizes the situa¬ 
tions and does sound effects and imitates different people's 
voices. 
We drove up to Mabry Mill and got there about 3 p.m. to watch 
the video-taping of local dancers and musicians. Then Carl, 
Harley, two people from a Greensboro, N.C. television station, 
and I went to J.L. Hatchers house near Ararat to film him for 
t.V. and to make tape recordings of him for the project. 
We sat on his front porch for most of the recording, but at one 
point we walked around the house and he pointed out and 
explained various medicinal plants in the yard. He talked' 
about church history, slavery times, religion, and cures on 
the three reels of tape we made, Carl took pictures of him 
during the interview.

Roseanne, Arnold Scofield, and I went to the Traphill, N.C. 
area for the day. We first stopped at the Florence Cheek house 
where her grandson and his wife from Winston-Salem were visiting 
and canning beans and tomatoes. They were cooking outdoors in 
a washtub over a charcoal fire. Arnold took detailed notes on 
this process which are included. I took photos of the storage 
shed where they kept their canned goods and another shed where 
green beans (leather britches) were strung up to dry. I also 
took photos of Florence Cheek's quilts i 1) Log Cabin, 2) Log 
Cabin, 3) Fence Row (Called Rail Fence in Ladies Home Journal 
pattern which she showed to us), 4) Trip Around the World or 
"on that order", 5) Trip Around the World without the backing, 
6) Bow Tie. I made two reels of tape of Mrs. Cheek describing 
her quilting process, talking about her childhood, and telling 
of her religious conversion experience. We next went to the 
Stone Mountain Craft Shop where we interviewed Ruth Holbrook 
who manages the shop. This is a cooperative with 30 members 
who place ther crafts in the store on consignment. She gave 
us the names of several craftspeople in the areas Elva Hayes, 
chair caner and split bottom maker; Ethel Smith; Rozella Shores; 
Dorothy Norman; Lester Bird, woodcarver. Ruth Holbrook is a 
good talker and knows local legends and history. She told 
stories about how she had hoaxed outsiders with "hill shoes" 
and jokes @h outdoor toilets. She told about famous Siamese 
twins who were from Traphill and lived in the house that is 
now used for the craftshop (built before 186?). She also gave 
the story of how Traphill got its name. I plan to return and 
record her later. We bought some preserves and a split oak 
basket from^the shop. We next went to the home of Claude Kennedy 
who is a knife maker. He makes them from spring steel and hack¬ 
saw blades and uses wood, brass, aluminum and deer antlers for 
the handles. Many of his knives are decorative and for show, but 
he also^makes functional knives. Both kinds are very popular with 
people in the area, and the stores sell them as fast as he makes 
them. He^started making them after he got sick and had to retire 
from farming. He lives in a brick home, but he moved his old 
two room saddlebag house in back and uses it as his shop. I 
took pictures of him, his knives, tools, and shop. Arnold and 
I plan to return and record him. 
8/20/78 Pat Mullen 
Roseanne, Terry, Wes Leishman, and I went to the Laurel Glenn 
Regular BaptistChurch in Alleghany County near Sparta for 
worship services. We met the pastor, Millard Pruitt, at the 
front and asked him if we could take pictures and record, and 
he agreed. We had come in Terry's car and the reel-to-reel 
tapes were in my car so that we had to settle for cassette tapes 
of the service. Terry took photographs and I made the recording. 
Facing the pulpit, the women sat on the left and the men of the 
right. The pastor and the song leader (Ray Caudell, a frequent 
visitor from the Mt. Carmel Union Baptist Church) stood in front, 
and the pastor's brother who was to lead the opening prayer sat 
behind the pulpit. There were 30 people prsent including these 
three and five children. Four hymns were sung from one book 
(R.E. Winsett, Best of All)i #113» The Great Reaping Day; #112, 
Will You Meet Me Over Yonder; #109, I Feel Like Traveling On; 
#101, Anywhere is Home. The fifth hymn was from another book 
(Benjamin Lloyd, The Primitive Hymns)» #352, Now in Thy Praise 
Eternal Come. The sixth hymn was from D.H. Goble, Primitive 
Baptist Hymn Books #277, A Home in Heaven. After this hymn, 
the pastors brother read and made brief comments on a passage 
from scripture and then he lead the prayer which was chanted 
with several emotional wails in it. The congregation then sang 
Amazing Grace, and Pastor Pruit began the sermon. The sermon 
was chanted, very emotional, and very effective. It lasted 
about a half hour at which time #148 in Winsert An Empty 
Mansion was sung. Then a short closing prayer was said, and 
the congregation sang as they walked around the church shaking 
hands and embracing. The women came over to the men's side for 
this and then returned. After the service was over and people 
were visiting with each other a spontaneous hymn singing took 
place for a.few minutes. We met and talked to several people 
afterwards including a young man who was a recent convert, 
T.J. Worthington and Jane McCrae, a librarian from Elkin, N.C. 
The pastor invited us to his house for dinner and we drove the 
short distance to his farm. His wife and Roseanne stayed in 
the kitchen cooking the meal while the men sat in the living 
room and talked. The subject matter was usually religion and 
Mr. Pruit dominated the conversation with his religious, politi¬ 
cal and racial views. He also played fiddle and banjo and sang 
which we recorded! fiddle-- l)Lonely Tombs, 2) Jesus is Coming 
Soon, 3) I Remember the Time; banjo—1 )A Low Wind Sweeping, 
2) Will the Circle be Unbroken. Mr. Pruit believes in separation 
of the races; he is a conservative Republican whose favorite 
presidents are Hoover and Nixon. He also voted for George Wallace 
and Strom Thurmond. He also believes in the traditional role 
for women in the kitchen and behind the man in social situations. 
We had the following for dinnert chicken'(frozen store bought), 
home-grown beans, carrots, okra, and potatoes, and tomatoes. 
Additional notes on church service: all of the mean knealt 
during the long first prayer; a woman recommended we talk to 
Bessie Brooks, and old church member from Sparta. 
8/21/78 Pat Mullen 
Today Harley and I went to the home of Fred Clifton in Vesta♦ 
Va. He was working in his wood shop in the basement when we 
got there, and he showed us around his work area, his tools, 
and some of the things he has madei gavels, plaques, stools, 
and beds. He showed us his wood storage area in sheds in back 
of his house where he has many different kinds and sizes of 
wood. He then showed us his artifacts which he has on display 
in his study and in a special relic room upstairs. He has 
acc umulated historical items--shoes, clothes, gramophones, 
records, nails, tools, farm equipment, etc.—which he has used 
to make a museum in his own home. He has also donated many 
items to the Patrick County Historical Society in Stuart which 
has created a museum with them. Mr. Clifton started his 
collection because he was a school teacher and principal and 
saw a need to preserve historical artifacts for his students 
to study and learn. We made three reels of tape with Harley 
doing most of the interviewing. Most of the material was 
historical both regional and personal family focusing on such 
topics as chesnuts in the economy, 4th of July celebrations, 
how his ancestors came from England, one-room school experiences 
and a place name legend. He is a very rational man and refused 
to talk about superstitions on the tape. Cff the tape he told 
about a belief that when someone planted a buckeye tree, they 
would die before the first buckeyes were produced and thatthis 
had actually happened, but he added that this was nonsense. 
After the first tape reel was made, we drove around Meadows of 
Dan and Vesta, and he pointed out things of historical interest 
to us, and I photographed them. We went to the church where 
he has been a lifetime member, the Mountain View Methodist 
Church, and he pointed out the 19th Century hand-made benches 
inside. We drove to the graveyard where his family is buried 
and^he.showed us his grandfathers stone which has models of 
quail in it, and his own marker which is made out of native 
stone as opposed to all the rest which are made from stones from 
other regions. He then took us to a place overlooking the 
Piedmont on the edge of the Blue Ridge which was owned by an 
old doctor friend of his where they used to come for picnics 
and social gatherings. He pointed out Cloudbreak Rock and 
later told us a legend of how it got its name which we recorded. 
We next went to a house which had belonged to is great- 
uncle which is the oldest house in Vesta that has been kept 
up. We took photographs of the house, and then returned to his 
home where we completed the tape recording. On the way out 
of his house as we left *he pointed out trees and shrubs in 
his yard. He is also interested in geology and rock collecting. 
8/22/78 Pat Mullen 
Wes Leishman and I went to the Sparta area with the idea of 
contacting and interviewing black people. We first went to the 
house of Dean Gambill who had been recommended by Walter Brown. 
Mr. Gambill was sitting in the door of the granery behind his 
house cleaning green beans for his wife to can. He gave us 
information about Walter Brown's father, Zeb, who had grown up 
on the New River in Nile, Ya. near Baywood where Mr. Gambill 
had been brought up. Mr. Gambill's mother and father had 
separated when he was eight years old and he had been raised by 
a white man, Jack Willey, who he had been very close to, called 
him "Daddy", slept with him and the white children, went to 
a white school until he was 13. Dean Gambill went to work in 
the coal mines of West Virginia at the age of 16 and spent 8 
years there. He spoke of the wild life at the mines, drinking, 
cussing, fighting, killings, that he was not used to and did 
not take part in because of his religious background. He also 
worked building the Parkway, carried the mail for 5 years, and 
worked as a clerk in hardware and general stores in Sparta for 
30 years. During all this time he also farmed a few acres in 
his spare time. The people who run the hardware store are 
descendents of slave owners, and"they still have a feeling for 
colored people" meaning they were good to them and took care of 
them. Some whites objected to a black man clerking in the store, 
but his employers backed him up. He learned how to be a clerk 
by observing whites, and he commented, "I had a head just like 
they had." He bought his own farm with money he saved from his 
work in the coal mines j he lived on $2 to $3 a week while he 
"batched" at the coal mines. His family remained in North 
Carolina. In 1951 on Easter Sunday his house burned down, and 
some of his children perished. He commented on how his white 
neighbors took care of him, donated money, and helped build a 
new house. Juanita Bryan, the pianist at the Macedonia Church, 
is Gambill's daughter, but he has maintained membership in the 
Primitive Baptist Church. Mr. Gambill farmed until two years 
ago, but now he just keeps up his garden because of failing 
health. We also met and talked to his wife who was cooking 
on a wood stove (the only stove she had and which whe prefers 
over any other kind) and canning green beans. She used to 
make quilts but doesn't anymore. She worked as an assistant 
dietician at a hospital for 18 years and is now retired. I 
took photos of the wood stove and of Mrs. Gambill preparing 
green beans for canning. Mr. Gambill showed us around the 
farm--his garden, shed where canned goods are stored, out 
buildings including work shop and barn which he built himself. 
He told us a story of how he got control of a stubborn mule. 
I took photos of him in the garden and of the barn and out 
buildings. He also talked about how he first met his wife and 
of his religious conversion experience. We made an appointment 
to come back next week to record the Gambill's when they are 
not as busy. We filled out an interview form on Mr. Gambill 
before we left.

After lunch, Wes and I went to the home of Leonard Bryan who 
had been recommended by Dean Gambill. Mr. Bryan was mowing 
his yard when we came up; he stopped and we sat on his back 
porch and talked. He is 8? years old and was born in Alleghany 
County. He worked in the West Virginia coal mines for 32 years 
because he was in debt on his farm and couldn't make enough 
money farming to keep up the payments. He has black lung and 
gets payments which along with social security supports him 
and his wife my now. When he first went to W.Va. he stayed a 
year, but then for the rest of the time he was there, he drove 
back and forth to his home in N.C. every two weeks. His wife 
and children stayed in N.C. He worked at #9 mine above Gary, 
W.Va. White and black people communted to the mines from N.C., 
and 2 or 3 whites rode with him. He lived in a company house 
and "batched" in order to save money. He joined the Macedonia 
New Covenant Baptist Church when he was 22 and has been a member 
since. He married in and he told us the story of his 
courtship and marriage; he first saw his wife when she was nine 
years old and made arrangements with her mother to marry her 
when she was older, and they were married when whe was 14. 
He also told about his religious conversion experience. He 
talked more about the mines; has seen men killed in the mines, 
started before unions came in, saw the first strikes. He left 
the mines permanently in 195^ when he was 5^ years old. He 
worked his own farm after that and also plowed gardens for 
white people in Sparta. His wife plants by the signs and uses 
Blum's Alamanac. We didn't talk to his wife; she seemed very 
suspicious of us. She has told him not to dig potatoes on the 
new of the moon because they'll rot. His wife still does 
canning. I took some photographs of Mr. Bryan and filled out 
an interview form on him. I plan to return to record him. 
8/23/7® Pat Mullen 
Today I took Terry and Lyntha to photograph the John Weather¬ 
man I-house, out buildings, barn, and the owner, Adam Clement. 
Arnold and Roseanne went along. Terry and Lyntha photographed 
the house inside and out as well as all the out buildings. They 
then took pictures of Adam Clement and g got some additional 
information about the house. The house next door which Mr. 
Clement lives in was built after the I house by his father. His 
father and John Weatherman married sisters which is why they 
lived next door to each other. The well house was jsed for 
storing preserves and canned goods and had sawdust in the walls. 
It was built the same time as the I-house as far as he knows. 
The barn was built when he was a boy of 10 or 12. The corn 
crib was built 30 years ago. John Weatherman built the barn, 
but two other men built the corn crib and well house. It 
has been 20 years since anyone has lived in the I-house. 
In talking about Wilkes County, N.C., Mr. Clement said, 
"They're a whole lot meaner down there." He said they still 
make moonshine in Wilkes Co., and that they also grow 
marijuana. He also mentioned that Roy Epperson still farms 
with mules, but he also uses tractors. 
We next went up to Jesse Hatcher's house where Terry and 
Lyntha photographed Mr. Hatcher, his house, barn, an old 
fro and other tools. He showed us where he was drying apples 
and we took pictures of that. He gave me some additional 
information he hadn't mentioned on my previous visits. He 
worked in the W.Va. coal mines for 5 years, 1910-1915, His 
uncle got killed in the mines. The Hatcher house is over 
90 years old and was built by a white man, W.W. Spangler who 
sold the house to Mr. Hatcher's parents. He showed us many 
old artifacts around his house including a cow bell which belonged 
to his wife's grandmother who was 103 when she died. 
8/25/78 Pat Mullen 
Harley, Wes, and I drove over to Ararat to see McKinley Brim, 
the father of Fred Brim, and one of the older black men in 
the community. He was curing tobacco when we got there, and 
he showed us the tobacco barn he had built himself out of logs 
ten years ago. It had been a communal affair since family and 
neighbors helped to build it. He had been chinking the barn 
with red mud dug nearby, and he was tending the fire. I took 
photos of the tobacco inside, the fire, the chinked places, 
the place where he dug the chinking, his tools for chopping 
fire wood, and the barn itself as well as pictures of Mr. Brim. 
He also showed us his cane press and molasses evaporator and 
explained them to us. We left when he went to lunch, and we 
v/ent into Ararat and ate at Boyd's diner where Mr. Boyd gave us 
the name of several leads. We then went to Epperson's store 
and talked to Mr. Epperson and one of the customers. They also 
recommended several people to contact including Roy Epperson 
who still farms.with mules. We went out to Roy Epperson's farm 
and talked to him. He also uses tractors and keeps the mules 
because several of his employees prefer plowing with mules or els 
don't know how to operate a tractor. I also think he keeps the 
mules mor nostalgic reasons. He agreed to let us come back and 
photograph them. We went back to McKinley Brim's house and 
interviewed and made three reels of tape. He talked about 
traditional methods of farming, family history, church and 
religion. I interviewed him on one tape, Harley did the nest 
ano then .Ves did the last. We walked down to the tobacco barn 
with him at one point to tend the fire. We drove back through 
the apple and peach orachards of western Patrick County on the 
slopes of the Blue Ridge. We stopped and bought a bushel of 
peaches and talked to Ernest Harrell whose father owns a large 
orchard and trucking operation. Ernest agreed to talk to one 
of the researchers at a later date. 
8/27/78 Pat Mullen 
We took five people to the Macedonia New Covenant Baptist 
Church this morning with the hope of recording and photographing 
the service; unfortunately the deacons had met yesterday and 
decided not to let us in for this purpose but they did invite 
us to attend. This was their annual Communion and Homecoming 
service, and they didn't want any disruption on a special day. 
Harley, Wes, and I stayed for the services and dinner. Singing 
started at 10;30 with Leonard Bryan and a woman member leading. 
We didn't catch the name of the first song, but the second one 
was "Oh, Lord I Want You to Move". There were no song books, 
but most of the people seemed to know the words. Most of the 
songs were gospel with repeated refrains every other line; the 
leader would sing a line and the congregation would sing the 
refrain. The woman leader kept time with a tamborine, and Mr. 
Bryan clapped his hands.Sabe Choate led the first prayer and 
there was congrgational response throughoutj "Thank you, Jesus" 
"Ch, yes" "Have mercy" along with moaning. The third song was 
"Heaven Belongs to You" and a piano was added with a young woman 
playing. The piano continued with every song throughout the service. 
The next prayer was chanted by Walter Brown with similar 
response to the first prayer. Mr. Bryan said a few words of 
thanks, and then lined out a hymn. The woman song leader read 
from scripture, the New Testament passage about except a man 
be born again he can't enter the kingdom of heaven; she then 
testified emotionally about what Jesus has done for her. Another 
woman led the next prayer, also chanted with response. The 
next song was "Lord Lift Me Up" after which Mr. Bryan called on 
the congregation to be lively in their worship. "I Feel Like 
Pressing My Way" was sung with more hand clapping and swaying 
and.a few people standing up. There were four preachers seated 
behind the pulpits the two regular preachers, the old semi- 
retired Rev. Gentry, the younger regular, Rev. Young, the 
Moderator of the New Covenant Baptist Association, Rev. McMillan, 
and a young visiting Holiness preacher wearing a clerical 
collar. Rev. Gentry began the preaching, and by this time the 
church was full and extra chairs were brought in. Rev. Gentry's 
sermon was chanted and built up to an emotional peak within 
10 minutes; as he chanted the intensity of the congregational 
response increased. He used repeated phrases which seem to be 
formulaic and the congregation repeated some of them. Rev. 
Young then got up and introduced the Moderator for the main 
sermon. He also built up the intensity of the response but more 
slwoly than Rev. Gentry had; McMillan's sermon lasted about a 
half hour. When he concluded the congregation sang "Til I 
Die" in a more spirited fashion with hand clapping, standing, 
and more rhythmic emphsis. Sabe Choate and Walter Brown both 
said a few words of thanks, and the congregation filed past the 
front to place money in the collection plates while they sang 
8/27/78 Fat Mullen (continued) 
"Are You Washed in the Blood of the Lamb" and "Its Another 
Days Journey and I'm So Glad". While the money was being 
counted by the Deacons, the congregation sand "The Road Gets 
Rough and Rocky" "Tell the Angels I'm on My Way" and "I've 
Got a Feeling Everythings Going to be Alright". During the 
las song an emotional peak was reached and people continued to 
talk, moan, and yell after the song was over. Walter Brown 
repeated some of the words of the song to response from the 
group. $132 was collected for the pastors, and $143 for the 
church. Announcements of upcoming meetings were made and 
the service was over at 12i30. 
We went outside where people were standing around talking, and 
we talked to two of the deacons! Mr. Bryan invited us to stay 
for the dinner which was being served in the basement. We 
were served chicken, ham, potato salad, macaroni salad, green 
beans, bread, German choclate cake, and orange pop. Some of 
the people ate at tables in the basement and others went out 
under the trees and by their cars. Mr. Brown told me it would 
be alright to take pictures outside. I took photos of people 
visiting with one another and of George McCoy Hampton, a 94 
year old man, and his daughter Mrs. Viola Carter of Woodlawn, 
Va., and of a group of children standing on the steps of the 
church including Robyn Price of Elkin, N.C. 
The singing started up again inside about 1»30, and we went 
back in during a prayer at about 1s45. After the prayer, the 
congregation sang "I Shall Not be Edved". Mr. Brown said a 
few words of welcome and turned the pulpit over to Rev. Young 
who started his sermon. After saying that he couldn't preach 
because the morning sermons had been so fine, he proceeded to 
preach the best, most intense, most involving sermon of the 
day. He chanted it, and he moved all over the front of the 
church, down the aisle, sometimes .sitting, turning his back to 
make a point, weeping, shouting, kneeling, and finally ending 
speaking very quietly to make his final points. The congregation 
then sang "That's All Right" with the line "One of thses mornings 
and it won't be long, look for me, and I’ll be gone." The 
visiting Holiness preacher said the blessing at the beginning 
of the communion, and the congregation sang "I'm Going Back with 
Jesus When He Comes" while the bread was being passed around. 
Another blessing was said before the drinking of the communion 
wine (probably grape juice), and they sang "I Know it was the 
Blood" and "Nobody but You, Lord". Rev. Young mentioned that 
wine and bread was being taken to a member who couldn't attend. 
They then sang "Just a Few More Days", "Tell the Angels", and 
Started the foot washing ceremonies. Two basins were brought 
out (plastic, I think), and two long towels which were wrapped 
around the waist of one man (Rev. Young) and one woman. The 
women washed other women's feet and men washed men. The towel 
was passed from one person to another. It appeared that only 
deacons and mothers of the church took part in this ceremony, 
about 10-12 people in all. The congregation then san^ the final 
song, "Search Me, Lord" and people started becoming more emotional 
HwBBBHH 
8/27/78 Fat Mullen (continued) 
until finally a woman went into a spirit possession trance, 
turning around, yelling "Glory, Lord", until she collapsed 
and had to be caught by people standing by. Two more women 
started into trances, then it died down, and picked up again. 
Many peole stood around and watched and embraced and shook 
hands, and cried. Others went outside; some of the deacons 
and the preacher left before the trances were over. We left 
and talked to Deacon Brown, Deacon Choate, Mr. Bryan, Rev. 
Young, Rev..McMillan, and thanked them all for having us. I 
also took pictures of all these gentlemen as well as one of 
Rev. Gentry.earlier. I then took photos of people visiting with 
each other in the church yard and of the cemetary. The services 
were overeat 3, and when we left at 3*30 people were still 
standing and talking around the church. Many children were 
present throughout the morning and afternoon, and during the 
afternoon service they could be heard playing outside. 
8/28/78 Pat Mullen 
Arnold and I went to Traphill, N.C. to interview and Ruth 
Holbrook and Clyde Kennedy. Ruth Holbrook had already been 
recorded by Gerri with the concentration on quilting, and 
I wanted to tape her as a storyteller. We set up the recorder 
in a room at the Stone Mountain Craft Shop across the road 
from her house. She seemed relaxed and eager to talk to us. 
We did two reels of tape in which she told family anecdotes, 
local character anecdotes, place name legends, and stories of 
her hoaxes on outsiders. After we had packed up the equipment 
she remembered some additional family stories, and we may go back 
and record her again. We recorded Claude Kennedy in his shop 
where he makes his knives. Arnold did the major part of the 
interview. Kennedy talked about knife making, saw mill 
experiences, and moonshining. He was arrested for making liquor 
illegally in 1938 and spent a year in prison. He told some 
personal stories about moonshining off the tape, but refused 
to tell them on the tape. I took pictures of him during the 
recording. We also took photos of Mrs. Holbrook outside the 
craft shop. We went by the home of Marvin Lyons who had been 
recommended by Ruth Holbrook, but he wasn't at home. 
Claude Kennedy told some stories about the Siamese twins and 
mentioned that his wife had read a recent book on them where 
he got some of his information on them. 
8/29/78 Pat Mullen 
Harley, Wes and I went to Meadows of Dan to interview Ben MJr" 
Harris who is known in the area as a storyteller. When I first 
met him, I didn*t mention the term storyteller, but he refered 
to himself that way. He readily agreed to be taped and we set 
up in his living room with his wife in the kitchen fixing dinner 
and listening to him talk. He told many local character 
anecdotes, a few jokes, and several personal experience stories. 
After one reel of tape, we ate dinner consisting of chfiken and 
noodle casserole, green and October beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, 
iced tea, and peaches. His wife prepared the meal, watched the 
men eat it, and didn't eat until we were through and had returned 
to the living room. I took photos of Jr., of the group at 
dinner, and of Jr. and his dog Mac who does a trick* Jr. runs 
a garage that services cars, he will open the hood of a car and 
ask Mac to diagnose the trouble, Mac jumps up on the engine 
and barks on one side or the other. 
After leaving Jr.'s we drove to Matt Burnett's house. He 
demonstrated his toys and tricks for Wes and Harley who had not 
seen them before. Wes bought one of his toys which needed a 
slight adjustment, and we accompanied Matt to his workshop 
and watched him repair the toy. He also gave us a sample of 
his auctioneering style which I plan to tape later. There is 
a possibility that the will be auctioning off a household 
before the project is over, and if this comes about, we will 
tape record it. He also mentioned that he carries an Irish 
potato in his pocket for rheumatism* the potato shrinks to the 
size of a marble in 3 weeks, and he showed us a couple of these. 
As we were leaving, he mentioned that he had some more hunting 
stories for me. I plan to return 
8/30/78 Pat Mullen 
I took Terry to the Walter Brown's near Sparta, N.C. so that 
he could spend the day photographing the Brown's everyday 
activities. We got there at about oi!5 a.m.j later in the 
morning Harley, Wes and I went to record Dean and Estelle 
Gambill at thier home. We recorded four reels of tape which 
included slave stories, mining experience stories, courtship 
stories, and a discussion of planting signs. I took picture 
of Mrs. and Mr. Gambill before we left. 
I interviewed Juanita Bryan, choir director of Macedonia 
NewCovenant Baptist Church who also plays piano in the church, 
in the afternoon at her home. She said there were three kinds 
of songs that were sung at her church, gospel* spirituals, and 
hymns. Spirituals she identifies as being black and going 
back to slavery time; they are usually spirited and up tempo. 
Gospel songs are similarly black and spirited, but are more 
recently composed. Hymns are essentially white and come out 
of the Baptist hymnals. Both gospel and spirituals she said 
express black people's feelings toward God and other people. 
At her church they mainly sing songs by black composers. The 
younger people in the church want change, they want to add 
electric guitars and drums to the service., but older people 
want to maintains the tradition of voices with piano or organ. 
The selction of songs in the service is spontaneous and 
determined by any member who wants to select a song. They 
believe in freedom of choice; anyone who wants to can take 
part in foot washing and in communion but no * one is required 
to take part either. Baptism is required. She said that they 
believe in "one God, One faith, and one baptism." She spoke 
at length about the personal feeling of getting caught up 
in the spirit of God during the service. She said she couldn't 
describe it adequately that a person had to experience for them¬ 
selves. She told us of their upcoming Association meeting 
which we plan to attend. 
9/2/?8 Pat Mullen 
I delivered Terry and Lyntha to the Brim farm where they spent 
part of the day taking pictures of family activities. I then 
looked for Harry Epperson to see about getting him and J.L. 
Hatcher togeter to reminisce about their bi-racial childhoodt 
I found that Mr. Epperson had just gone into the hospital. He 
is supposed to be okay and perhaps I can get them together 
within the next two weeks. 
I next went to Harrison Hensley's house where I talked to him, 
his wife, his wife's mother and brother. Harrison was recommended 
as a mountain man who knew the woods and herbs and roots. He 
talked about his father Ben Hensley who was a mountain man and 
how he had learned a lot from him. However Harrison says he 
doesn't practice too much of the old mountain lore any more. 
Harrison and his wife are very poor; they live in a small 
cinder block house which is provided for them by the man who 
owns it and the surrounding farm land. They keep a large garden 
and give some of the produce to their landlord; the rest they 
sell as their major source of income and can much of it to 
get them through the winter. Harrason used to work in the 
saw mills, but he has been in bad health for ? years and not 
able to work. He doesn't qualify for any kind of welfare or 
social security. They also hunt coons to eat and sell the hides. 
I spent the day with them in order to talk to them and observe 
their lifestyle. They showed me several hand-made tools they 
had made, and Minnie,Harrison's wife, showed me her canned 
vegatables and her wood burning stove. I took photos of all 
this and of Harrison, his wife, the mother, and the brother. 
Harrison gave me the names of several old-timers in the area. 
We discussed cures at length* a combination of several roots 
called bitters and used for swelling, rat vein used for back 
painsiphotos of rat vein which Minnie dug up). Harrison was 
raised at Busted Rock on top of the mountain near Meadows of 
Dan. He talked about Devil's Footprint on Busted Rock. He 
had several stories about supernatural experiences* hearing 
a wagon and horses which weren't there, noises in the woods 
like a baby crying, eyes shining in the dark, Isam Peck who 
was supposed to be awitch and who aarned a woman not to go 
to Dark Hollow, she does and is chased out by a mand with a 
pitchfork. He talked about Sam Carter, a black man who buys 
vegatable from him and how much he respects him. Harrison 
worked at a sawmill in Tennessee for two years, where he 
worked with Indians. He said Indians didn't want anybody to 
touch them. He told the story of a man who fell 350 feet 
and survived, but Harrison didn't believe him. Many people 
in the area make their own chewing tobacco by rolling it up 
with honey, sugar or molasses and chew it "straight cured." 
Harrison's father used to make illegal liquor and so did 
Harrison. He believes men landed on the moon because you 
can see they chunk they took out of it. He didn't want to 
be recorded, but indicated that he might on another day. 
9/4/78 Pat Mullen 
Blanton and I went to seek out Marvin Lyon near Roaring Gap* 
N.C. right near the line between Alleghany and Wilkes County. 
He wasn't at home, and we learned from aneighbor that he was 
out on a wagon train with some people who had camped out at 
his place. We went back in to Sparta for lunch, and after 
lunch went to the home of Houston Caudell in Sparta. Blanton 
and Hous talked about fidstle music, and t talked to him about 
fishing. His fishing lore on bait and how to catch fish did 
not seem to be distinctive to this region} I've heard similar 
things in Ohio and Texas: catching carp with dough bait flavored 
with beer and strawberry extract. We drove back to Lyon's 
and he still wasn't home. We talked to a man who was drilling 
for water on property bought from Marvin Lyon for a summer 
house, and Blanton took pictures of the drilling operation, 
which was a home-made rig. 
About 3*30 in the afternoon, Marvin returned home, and we began 
to record him. As he started, a friend Mrs. Thomas Evans dropped 
by, and she talked about her travel experiences, her childhood 
in Texas, and her religious and political beliefs for the first 
reel of tape. After she left, we recorded three more reels of 
tape on Marvin. He talked about his antique collecting, his 
leather work, his experiences with children from a nearby 
summer camp, and the variety of visitors he gets at his place. 
We didn't ask many questions since he is a good talker,and 
we just let him talk about what he wanted to. We got an idea 
of areas of interest that he might have stories about. After 
the recording, he gave us a tour of his house which is like 
a museum with tools, saddles, furniture, pottery, and other 
historical artifacts all over the place• He seemed to have a 
structured way of presenting this material, going from one 
room to another, selecting out objects of special interest to 
describe and explain in detail. We left about 9:00 with plans 
to return to tape and photograph. I took some pictures of him 
and his leather tools, as well as the stone chimney on his house. 
9/5/78 Pat Mullen 
The Ellers and I went to Marvin Lyon’s to photograph and do 
more recording. Again he wasn't at home when we got there, 
so we drove down to Traphil to photograph Ruth Holbrook. While 
they were taking pictures of her, she told me some more home 
remediesi euversy is an herb for the kidneys, thunderbolt or 
nerveayine is good for the nerves, willow has the same thing in 
it asvipirin, boil willow bark and wash fciour hair in it for 
dandruff, swamp alder is good for the liver. She recently 
bought a new herb book to learn more cures. Some other cures 
arei wild indigo for swelling, bears paw an herb is good for 
rheumatism; and she has heard of the Irish potato cure for 
rheumatism and agrees that they shrivel up. She said that 
water witching was practiced in the area, that they used a 
peach tree limb and a silver dime on the end. Walter Thompson 
found water where geologists had failed. She also mentioned 
some telephone pranks* "Is your refrigerator running?" "Yes.” 
"You better close the door before it gets out." "Have you got 
Prince Albert in a can?" "Yes" "Let him out before he smothers 
to death." She told of a time someone called her pretending to 
be a radio quiz show, if she answered a question, she'd get 
a prize, she answered it and they said her prize would be a 110 
pounds of horse manure, she said to send it on. 
We next went on the Claude Kennedy's house where the Eilers 
took pictures of him at work making a knife, pf his tools, 
his shop and many of his knives. 
After lunch, we returned to Marvin Lyon's and found him at 
home. He gave the tour of the house to the Eilers, and they 
took pictures of every room and many individual items in each 
room. Marvin showed me a copy of the Biography of Jacob Lyon 
byKermit L. Lyon (Rt. 1, Box 42?, Ronda, N.C.i 286?0, $5) 
which has information on Lyon family history. Jacob Lyon came 
to Wilkes County after the Civil War and was granted 100 acres 
by the state of North Carolina. Kwrmit's grandfather and 
Marvin's grandfather were brothers. Marvin commented on the 
furniture stacked all over his house, "I ain't got no wife so 
I can go ahaed and do what I want to." There seems to be some 
connection between his bachelor status and his collecting 
interests. I made three reels of tape of Marvin telling 
stories* hant tales (told to disprove ghosts and the super¬ 
natural, they involve a person who is scared by what they 
think is a ghost which later turns out to be a flying squirrel, 
cat on the roof, owl, cow, etc.), superstitions (which Marvin 
doesn't believe), place name legends, a hoax story, character 
stories, and moonshine stories (encounters with the law, getting 
drunk on white liquor, and one joke). We left about 8j30. 
9/6/?8 Pat Mullen 
In the afternoon, I took Boris Weintraub, a reporter from the 
Washington Star, along on a trip to interview and tape record 
Leonard Bryan near Sparta. When we arrived Mr. Bryan and his 
wife Mamie were sitting on the front porch, and we taped both 
of them. They talked about their courtship and wedding, home 
remedies, planting signs, his experiences in the West Virginia 
mines, his conversion experience, singing traditions in the 
Macedonia Church, and slave stories. I took pictures of them 
and oftheir house and flower garden. 
9/7/78 Pat Mullen 
Charles and I spent an hour in The House of Music, a record 
and tape shop in Galax, looking for old records and new ones 
from the area* Charles found and purchased several local 
gospel records for the Folklife Center. 
We went to record Walter Brown in Alleghany County. Charles 
wanted to meet Mr. Brown since Charles will be recording the 
Macedonia Church service next Sunday. We made two reels of 
tape on Mr. Brown which included* slavery experiences, family 
history, church history, mining experiences, planting signs, 
home cures, and church and secular music. As a deacon, he 
agreed to taping and photographing in the church on Sunday. 
I took several photos of his mining hat and of his house from 
the road. 
We checked out the Macedonia Church for recording problems and 
then went by Leonard and Mamie Bryans to ask for old photographs 
and discuss the taping on Sunday. They didn't have any old 
mme photographs but they had many family photographs which 
we took pictures of. These included* an oval picture of Mamie 
S grandmother, Bella Parks, mother, Mary Parks, sister, 
Bella McKinley, and herself as a young woman; the Bryan's 
wedding picture with her brother, Jeeter Parks, a friend Fred 
Edwards, her sister Kinney Parks, and Mamie and Leonard; and 
one of Leonard's grandmother Mrs. Goins. I also photographed 
hold^ their wedding picture, her canned glods, 
and contents, an9 °ne corner of the living room 
Ch^Ilstn!as ribbon decorations and the oval photograph on 
wall. we also found out that Mrs. Bryan has many old 
quilts in her attic. 
9/9/78 Pat Mullen 
Gerri and I drove to Alleghany County to the farm of Quincy Higgins and 
spent the day with him. When we arrived he was in his pick up truck near 
the bam, and he said he prefered being recorded there. We set up the 
tape recorder and made two reels of tape there. He talked about religion 
and told his conversion experience story and a story about a funeral in 
which he sang "Amazing Grace" as part of the story. He wanted to take us 
to the top af a mountain on his farm, and we got in the pick up and went 
with him recording all the way and part of the time on top of the mountain. 
He talked about his land and showed us the views frcm the top and jcked 
around and kidded us a lot. We did a total of four reels of tape before we 
left him to go into Sparta for lunch. Upon our return we found Mrs, 
Higgins and her sister at hhe house and talked to them for awhile. Mr. 
Hig|P-ns returned and we set up the tape recorder in the kitchen and 
recorded four more reels of tape, mostly of Quincy telling stories but 
also with several contributions from Mrs. Higgins and her sister. We 
talked about planting signs and cures, and the stories included Civil 
War legends, with witch tales, and personal exoerience stories. We tock 
photographs of the Higgins at the house, in the kitchen , and of Quincy 
around the farm. We noticed a competition between Mr. and Mrs. Higgins 
which led to them talking at the same time on the tape, and whichvas 
orobably the reason Mr. Higgins keot us away frcm the house during the 
first oart of the day. Higgins is a first-rate story teller and an 
interesting personality. We spent the entire day with him and didn't begin 
to exhaust his repertoire.

Wally Macnow of the National Park Service wksR went with me on a trip to 
Patrick County. We first went to the Blue Ridge Elementary school to see 
about getting permission to record and video tape children's games and 
rhymes. The principal Erie Perry was very cooperative, but he couldn't 
give permission without the approval of the superendident of the Patrick 
County shools. We drove to Stuart and waited until th.-Mr. Moye finished 
a school board meeting. He gave us permission to record at the school. 
We went to Harrison Hensley's farm to record hiin. I made two reels of 
tape of Harrison talking about his father as an herb doctor, roots and 
cures, witch stories, planting by the signs, and personal experiences. 
We recorded him sitting on the dog house in his front yard.

I took two friends from Columbus, Ohio, Annie Bertinolli and Dennis Aig , 
with me to record children"s rhymes at Blue Ridge Elementary School. We 
stopped at the principals office first and he took us to the cafeteria and 
introduced us to two 4th Grade teachers, Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Currier, 
who agreed to let us taoe record in their rooms. We started in Mrs. 
Currier’s roan because she had three black students and I was interested 
in observing black white interaction. Race relations seemed to be very 
good. One black girl was the best performer in the class, and her best 
friend was a white girl, and they performed several hand clapping rhymes 
together. The other black girl also chose to do a rhyme with a white friend. 
The black boy did a rhyme with a white boy. This mixture was voluntary 
on theri part. They did jump rope rhymes, hand clapping rhymes, and sang 
songs. Mrs. Hollands class was all white and they told two racist jokes 
which mentioned "nigger" and everyone laughed. They also toldd Polack 
jokes and sane riddles as well as the same jump rope and hand clap rhymes 
as the other class. There was only one rhyme which I would classify as 
black or African American, and it was done by the black girl who was the 
best performer, and she had learned it frcm a cousing fron New York City. 
After we left the school we went to see Mckinly Brim but he wasn't feeling 
well and couldn't visit with us. We next went to see Will Barnard, but 
he and his wife weren't hone. We drove up to Mayberry store and visited 
briefly with Addie Wood before driving the Parkway back to Galax

stories, church and family history. There daughter and grand great- 
grand daughter came over and I took pictures of all of them.

Ton, George Price, an intern, and I went to video tape the 4th grade 
classes at.Blue Ridge Elementary School. The children were waiting for 
us and excited about being on t.v. They did the same rhymes, songs and 
jckes which I had recorded cm 9/12, plus we has a panel discussion about 
play activities which led to a story telling session of ghost stories 
and humorous anti-legends. We video taped both Mrs. Holland's and Mrs. 
Currier's classes with the same sort of black white interaction in one 
class, and displays of racism in the other. The children watched the 
video tape we made along with the teachers and the principal. They seemed 
pleased with it. 
We went by the hone of Nora Reynolds the oldest wanan member of the Clarks 
Creek Progressive Primitive Baptist Church, but she wasn't feeling well, 
and we came on back to Galax

Tan and I surveyed 804 in Flqyd County. We drove fran one end to the 
other noting significant houses and buildings, gences, bams, and marking 
the mileage where they are located. We stopped at the house of Roy and 
Malissa Weddle (77 and 67) who have lived in the valley of Rush Fork since 
they were bom, and in their present house since 1931 shortly after they 
married. Roy Weddle is of German descent and is a member of the Church of 
the Brethren (Dunkards). His oarents and grandparents were also Brethren. 
Roy is a wood carver and has made sppons, ax and hoe handles, rolling pins, 
and he also makes knives. We took pictures of him and his wife, the farm 
and house, tools and hand made objects. We did three reels of tape with 
them talking about family and church history, planting signs, traditional 
ways of butchering hogs, and his wood crafts. Tan also took pictures of 
seme of the old photos of family and Brethren. After we left we took pictures 
of a stake and rider fence and a log bridge. 
After a late lunch we drove 804 fran the other direction, and shortly after 
we left it stopped at the old Keith hone where we took pictures of the 
I house and sane old mule ear chairs. We met D.J. Keith and his wife who 
both teach at Riyaot Floyd Co. H.S. and also run a farm. I tock pxrHxkx 
pictures of Mrs. Keith driving a tractor packing dillage. Whe gave us 
leads to an old-timey string band, the Kom Kutters, in which her father 
plays guitar and to her uncle Roger Slusher who lives on 804, and another 
Uncle George Slusher who has a barn built by the original German settlers 
who came down from Pennsylvania; the bam has wooden pegs. While we were 
talking with Mrs. Keiths, her husband's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Dewey Keith 
came by and we talked to them for awhile about local history, the Brethren 
Church near their house and the Primitive Baotist church tovhich they belong. 
Mrs. D.J. Keith asked us to speak to a folklore class at Floyd H.S. and 
we agreed. She is supposed to call to make arrangements.

The entire crew went to an auction near Woolwine. George Price went-;- 
with me to pick up Matt Burnett who told us about the auction, and 
When we arrived at the farm where the auction was being held, many people 
were already there looking over the household items to be auctioned. 
We made two reels of tape of Bob Gilbert auctioneering; he turned the 
auction over to Matt Burnett and we made two reels of Matt with an 
interview bh k with Matt on the end of his auction tape. The auction was 
crcwddd and refreshments were being sold. Seme of the items sold were: 
glass ware, china, dishes, furniture, musical instruments, farm tools, etc. 
We all took pictures of items, of people and of the auctioneers. The auction 
started at 11 in the morning and was still going when we left at 3; Matt 
said it would probably go until dark. The crowd seemed to be a mixture of 
local residents and antique dealers frem outside. 
We went back to Matt's house and made a reel and a half of tape of Matt 
telling how he got started in auctioneering, and how auctions have changed 
through the years, and hew the apprentice system works. He also told 
sane hunting stories, talked about children's games, and told seme personal 
experience stories.

Charles, Gerri, Gerri's husband Jim, Rich McCamant (intern), and I went to 
tape record and photograph the New Covenant Baptist Church annual Association 
meeting at the Redmond Creek New Covenant Baptist Church near Galax. The 
church is very small and there were three times as many people there as 
could fit into the church; many stood outside and listened, others gave up 
and visited with friends and relatives on the church grounds. There was 
both congregational and choir singing. The sermon was by the moderator 
of the Association, Rev. M. M. MacMillan. We recorded the entire service, 
a is total of 5 reels of tape. I took pictures inside during the service, 
and Gerri and I took pictures on the outside before and after the service. 
A dinner was served after the service and people visited with one another. 
A second service was scheduled for the afternoon, but we left before it 
started. I talked to Walter Brown, Delmar Bryan, Sabe Choate, Leonard 
Bryan, and Dean Gambill from the Macedonia Church. I gave Leonard Bryan 
and Dean Gambill conies of the Washington Star which had their nictures 
in it. They seemed pleased.
