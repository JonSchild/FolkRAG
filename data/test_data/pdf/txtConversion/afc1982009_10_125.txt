took meals with CliftonS and got introduced to Clifton’s museum of old 
mountain artifacts. 
Dr. Arthur, President of Ferrum , visited and asked Clifton to attend 
meeting to see if his^Ciifton's collection could be used as display in 
a new library at Ferrum. 
Ferrum borrowed much of Clifton’s collection. Done on loan until local 
Patrick county folk could establish a musuem of their own, using his material. 
Later Patrick County folk did establish a historical society and museum. 
"People have taken a great interest in it...” (He mentions stacks of

Conversation between Pat Mullen and Carl Fleiscchauer on McKinley Brim. 
•gRg' 'PM- 
Conversation with Pat Mullen and Carl Fleischhauer on McKinley Brim 
July 31, 1979 
Carl: Am I correct to think that all of the families that live in that 
community where for sure at one time slaves. 
Mullen: Yesi They are descendants of slaves. 
Carl: Your sense of it is that fcha after Emancipation, atleat the one^s hkh 
that are today their ancestors or the older generation didn't feel any real 
ambition to get out. 
Pat: Nearly all of them stayed from what people told me. It wasn't really 
until Fred Brim generation that any of them left. And when that started some 
of them moved back and brought spouses with them from the Piedmont usually. 
Carl: Does Fred have a Masters, from a school of education. 
Pat: Yes. 
Cairl: Is he more than a teacher? 
Pat: Yes! He is some kind of Administrator, Director of some Educational 
also 
Program. He's more than a teacher, he's^some kind of Administrator. 
Carl: Is that a secondary school or elementary. 
Pat: Secondary! A high school. 
-2- 
Carl: What do we call the community? 
Pat: They don't call it Carter's Mill^they say they live in Ararat and that's 
their mailing address. The Church is called Clark's Creek but I usually hear 
them refer-to their community as Ararat. 
Carl: We are talking about McKinley Brim and if we say he's from Ararat that 
would sit well with him. , 
Pat: Right! That's his mailing address and that's where they go into buy 
every day things. 
Carl: RHKtX I noticed in your fieldnotes there where something about him 
carrying or move cross ties with oxen, did I remember that right. 
Pat: I think so, its been a^ong time sine I've heard that particular tape. 
Carl: "Fred's father carried cross ties by oxen over the mountains'.' (from 
fieldnotes) 
Pat: I think Fred told me that. I don't remember whether I followed that up 
with McKinley or not. 
Carl: Using the word "cross ties" implies that would have been when the rail' 
roads where being built. The railroad must have started^coming in that area 
even before McKinley was born. 
-3- 
Carl: Terry had this impression of him and work. He felt that he got great 
A. \ 
enjoyment out of work and dj^'t mind hard work; irifact he felt that he rewarded 
himself with breakfast after early morning working in the tobacco fields. 
Pat: I agree with that. He is a worker! Mb That's his whole life, his working. 
He's not one of those people who is tied up in the church or even in his family 
He gets up and he works all day longhand what ever there is to do around thei^ 
if there's nothing to do he makes up something. He is a very work-oriented 
person and that comes out very strongly in the interview. 
Carl: BidxixifiiixyBHXHKxelHXKKilafixi* Maybe I told you that we where going to 
do a spread on Brim. Let me tell you the details, some of it pertains to the 
church and his family and maybe you will have some ideas there. 
This is sandwich in between Carrie Seavert and the Keith's. The first spread 
is sort of an intro to Brim. And there is a shot of him in the tobacco fields 
and a close up of his face. He's out there looking at the bright leaf and I 
gathered that at that moment it probably wasn't quite ready to pick. Or had 
he begun picking or do you no. 
Pat: I think he had begun, because one day when we down there towards the 
end he had it in the tobacco barn smoking it, or curing it. 
Carl: It stands to reason because they were picking itx elsewhere in the 
-4- 
pM-ci' 
bright leaf. It is the BrightJ_eaf for sure, 
Pat: Is that the Bright Leaf region. 
Carl: Its flue^cured and flue-cured is Bright Leaf. Bandy So that is sort 
/> /y 
of the first spread. Is ^meet Brim and here he is and haw he relates to 
tobacco. Then you turn the page and there's a group of four pictures^and 
these start to get more into the family domestic scene. There is a shot 
that Terry made of him and Birdie on both sides of what looks to be a 
'V 
burning stove in their living room. And there is a shot of her taking a 
|Q_v\ 
bucket of stuff out to the chickens. And a shot of her at that little^+ft.^ 
for the chickens. And a shot of McKinley at the breakfast table where he's 
poured some coffee into a saucer and blows across the saucer to cool it. 
Which Terry says is after working. So that's the only part that we run into 
Birdie. TBaxRaxixpaKixixxxwh That's followed by a spread in which he is leading 
i 
the cow. The Questions I have^ ^what's to be said about Birdie^ She is 
from the community. She's the sister of one of the women you talked to. 
Pat: Was she a Carter? That's the other old family;the Carter's and^riniH «. 
\ 
They are two of the prominent black families that have been there for generations 
So there has been this kind of link in the Brim family between the Carters and 
the BRims between McKinley and Birdie. That kind of solidify the community in 
-5- 
Cb 
terms of there being a limited number of families there. 
Carl: Her sister is Minerva Carter that you visited first. The other 
sister that's living in the are you wrote down as Orie Strickland. 
Pat: She's very old. I went by there and she was to weak to even talk to 
me. But I think there was two sisters. No^the other one married into the 
family and the other was a sister of Birdie. 
KamxxMmmxmMm 
Minyerva Stewart is her sister and there is another Carter that ! took pictures 
of who married into the family. 
Carl: Birdie is the wife and mother in the usual Sirree^ 
Pat: I think she is the link with the church. She is more active in the church. 
She is probably the one who influenced Fred and Doris ir^erms of religion. 
Brim didn't talk much about religion. Birdie kHpixihexfamiity influenced the 
kids. 
Carl: I have this impression from the Ei ler^e that she was shy with visitors 
i lerV 
and we don't have much on her. 
Pat: She was always shy. She was shy with me from the beginning. He is shy. 
XXKHilXXft The interview was not an easy interview. He is not a talker and we 
had to squeeze everything out of him. And Fred looked at things from an 
Educated point and understood why we where there.

6v>W v ^ 
Carl: You dont anticipate any uncomfortness if this comes outT^o you* 
Pat: They are so shy, but they understood that. From the beginning they 
understood that what those pictures where for. I told them that. There could 
pt1-’ _v)'cvT'^y 
be some uncomfortableness. But I think it could be outby there feelings 
of family pride. 
Carl: Do you remoter anything about that Cow. XIX Terry said that McKinley 
told him "that this old cow I had her for sixteen years, she doesnlt give-milk 
anymore but I keep her anyway. 
Rid: Does that that sound plausible1? 
Pat: Sure! People get attach^to thetr cows. He's got some old mules there 
to that he is attached to. 
r\ 
Carl: He does have mules. One pair or do you remember exactly. 
Pat: Seems like there is a pair. He don't use them much. He just kind of 
same \ 
kept them s the XX# way. MXXX The only person that still usesmules is that 
N \ 
white farmer. 
,Vjo> >1 
Carl: Did yau McKinley and his wife have a vegetable garden? Would they have 
used the mules to plow the vegetable garden? 
Pat: I doubt it. 
Carl: The next spread gets'Hjs^us to the church. Here the pictures all give us

Fred and Doris. It wasn't clear if McKinley and Birdie comes to church. 
Pat: Birdie was there but McKinley wasn't. The day I took the pictures 
I was trying to get a conversion story out of McKinley. He changed^but it 
wasn't like a big thing like with a lot of other people. IxwaxxiKying 
Carl: The pictues we have I don't know who took them. Theres a picture of 
Fred playing the piano and Doris standing with a group of people singing. 
Another takwg on a different occasion of Fred. A picture of the exterior 
A 
of the church building under construction. Carl mentioned that he would use 
some of the notes on the old church building and the construction of the new 
building. 
Pat: Hatcher's tapes give' more history of the Church. 
Carl: The pictures lead up to the next generation of BrimV They show 
who McKinley and Birdie's children are. This very old-fashio :ss didn't

Carl: Is Fred Married, Is Doris Married?* Where do they live? 
Pat: Lives at home and Fred has a housej just down the road. 
They are all Bri 5 down that road, a little gravel road. Four other houses 
with Brim brother's. They are McKinleyfcsxbothers, One is a deacon in the church,

Carl: Does Doris workV 
Pat: Yes! She was also shy about being interviewed. 
Carl: Doris is our contact for permission on the phonograph record. 
Is she younger than Fred? 
Pat: They have a phone. 
TU Pwn,. 
Carl: ^inal spread is on the tobacco &eB=d-. It shows the building from the 
h A 
non-working end, the whole building. And Terry has some pictures of McKinley 
firing up the burners at the door end. We have your notes on the thing being 
built ten years ago. About ten years ago with neighbors and friends in the 
RHtXX traditional style. And that is where he cures his tobacco. BaxyaM 
Where does he market his tobacco? 
Pat: No! I never understood like Blanton did. 
Check the form for the phone numbers, for Fred. 
Pat's impressions of the since of the extended family all of them living down 
there together and being on the same land since before the Civil War, and the 
church and the family connection. 
Carl: How was there land obtained? 
Pat: See the Hatcher interview.

a nice to say. You get from the pictures'.tobacco farmer, black guy with wife

Pat: When will it be out. 
Carl: Next year 1981.
