GENERAL PROGRAM
 
(
Presentation - Festival)
 
*
For the second year, the Folk Arts Program has provided a grant of $
3,000
 
to the Jewish Community Centers of South F
lorida in support of a folk arts
 
component within their larger Jewish cultural festival.  S
ince F
lorida i
s
 
the home of many retired Jews, there was an enthusiastic response to a
 
search for expert o
ld-time wedding musicians (
klezmorim), calligraphers,
 
tailors, scribes, e
tc. to act as performers, demonstrators, and workshop
 
l
eaders in the folk arts part of the festival.  I
ndeed, so many senior
 
c
itizens volunteered to share their skills that the festival has been
 
retitled:  "Generation to Generation".  I
n "Bubbe's Bakery", teen-agers
 
can practice challah-twisting and s
imilar culinary skills under the
 
experienced eyes of a whole team of grandmothers.  Elderly yarn-spinners
 
recount their l
ife-histories in the refreshment area (
complete with g
lasses
 
of tea drawn from convenient samovars) to young Yiddish-speaking oral his-
torians, e
specially trained by the history department at the University
 
of Miami.  The traditional Jewish arts now run throughtout the entire
 
festival, bringing past and present into a c
oherent whole to the apparent
 
delight of the Miami audience, now more than tripled during the two years
 
of Folk Arts' small grants.

*A grant of $
15,355 was awarded the K
iowa Historical and Research Society
 
(
Oklahomans for I
ndian Opportunity) in order that the Renwick Museum exhibit
 
of the Mooney collection of K
iowa tipis might be displayed i
n K
iowa country,
 
and thus be made accessible to all members of the tribe.  The Mooney
 
collection consists of hand-made and e
legantly painted miniature copies
 
of the many tipis built on the occasion of the last K
iowa Sun Dance in 1
878.
 
This culturally s
ignificant exhibit will now be mounted for s
ome months
 
in the Fort Sill Army Museum near Lawton, Oklahoma.  Associated pow-wows
 
and feasts will be held by the K
iowas during the exhibition period.  The
 
opening festivities will include the ceremonial s
inging of the hundred-year-old
 
repertoire of Sun Dance s
ongs that have been passed down in families, though
 
not heard in public in the memory of any l
iving being.

*During 1
979, the Folk Arts Program awarded a grant of $
13,560 to the Oregon
 
Arts Commission in support of "Webfoots and Bunchgrassers", a major exhibition
 
of Oregon folk arts.  This exhibit s
tems from the work of the Oregon Folk
 
Arts Coordinator who, in the course of a
ssisting with a number of regional
 
Oregon f
olk arts festivals during her f
irst two years in the position, had
 
identified an extraordinarily active and varied crafts tradition within the
 
s
tate.  The woodcarvers of Oregon a
s a group are exceptionally f
ine, true
 
national treasures.  The exhibit, though initially planned f
or a s
ingle
 
museum showing in Portland, proved to be of such high artistic quality that
 
plans are now f
irm to tour i
t to four o
ther Oregon s
ites, e

inal
 
invitational showing a
t the Renwick Museum in Washington, D

spring of 1

*An i
nteresting community folk arts project has been developed through the
 
work of another of the s
tate Folk Arts Coordinators.  The Alabama State
 
Council on the Arts and Humanities was awarded a Folk Arts grant for $
5,940
 
to support a series of experimental workships in Alabama schools and
 
community facilities.  Short f
ilms on individual Alabama traditional
 
artists (
funded by Folk Arts in previous years) were shown, followed by
 
a l
ive presentation by the artists themselves, who range from blues-singers
 
to basket-weavers.  Each half-day workshop concluded with a public forum
 
participated in by the artists, the film makers, the folklorists, the
 
e
ducators, and the general public.  The agenda of each forum was to discuss
 
and plan for the better preservation and documentation of l
ocal folk arts.
 
This award highlights the Folk Arts Program's concern with developing and
 
s
trengthening l
ocal efforts and l
ocal initiatives in our field.

*An award of $
10,000 to La Casa de la Raza of Santa Barbara, California
 
supports an innovative radio series featuring the widely-known and extremely
 
popular narrative song form, the corrido. During the period of this grant,
 
corrido composers and s
ingers from Santa Barbara and Ventura counties
 
(
most of them farm workers) will be l
ocated and i
nvited to the radio s
tudio
 
to perform both traditional and original compositions in this Mexican and
 
Mexican-American musical form.  At the end of the series, the l
istening
 
audience will be invited to vote for their favorite performances.  A
 
phonograph recording of the compositions thus selected will then be i
ssued
 
for l

MEMORANDUM TO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON THE ARTS
 
FROM:
 LIVINGSTON L.  BIDDLE,  JR.
 
RE
 APPLICATIONS: 
Auxiliar
y Bellevue Hospital Center,  Inc./NY
 
LETTUMPLAY - Washington,  DC
 
University of Alaska - Juneau Campus
 
I referred the above applications to our Federal Council on the
 
Arts as you requested.
 Attached is a memorandum from Deborah Sale
 
on this matter,  as well as relevant information from Bess Hawes
 
and Paula Terry for your consideration.
 
I know there was concern expressed in the Council meeting about
 
the grants involved.
 They were discussed,  however,  in a context
 
which may not have been fully fair to them.
 I think it is fair
 
to point out that these particular grants are in line with our
 
traditional and approved practice and philosophy of bringing the
 
best in the arts to wider audiences.
 I think they are examples
 
of how the Arts Endowment does this uniquely for Special Constituencies
 
in the area of Folk Arts and Expansion Arts.
 For without our help,
 
the arts of quality -- and I do stress this characteristic -- would
 
simply not reach the audience that is involved.
 It is not a
 
utilization of the arts for therapy or for some other tangential
 
value,  for these projects have a basis in fine artists reaching a
 
particular group,  otherwise not to be reached,  in a unique and I
 
think laudatory fashion.
 
I feel we should really reconsider these three grants,  and so I am
 
bringing them especially to the attention of the Policy,  Planning
 
and Budget Committee for another look.
 I appreciate your kind
 
attention  to this matter and will ask John Clark to call the Committee
 
.members within a few days to C
jCt  their thoughts on how best to proceed.

TO:
 LIVINGSTON BIDDLE
 
CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL END M4ENT FOR THE ARTS
 
FROM:
 DEBORAH SALE
 
DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON, FEDERAL COUNCIL ON THE ARTS AND THE HUMANITIES
 
RE:
 APPLICATIONS REFERRED TO THE FEDERAL COUNCIL .
BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL
 
ON THE ARTS
 
At the request of the National Council on the Arts, the Federal Council on the
 
Arts and the Humanities staff has attempted to find within the government
 
alternate sources for funding the three applications:
 
1
.  Auxiliary Bellevue Hospital Center, Bellevue Hospital Center,
 
New York.
 
2
.  Lettumplay, Inc., Washington, D
.C.
 
3
.  University of Alaska, Juneau, Alaska.
 
The staff has so far been unsuccessful.  Staff has discussed the applications
 
with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education,
 
the Administration on Aging and with .
a number of branches of the Department
 
of Justice.  While these agencies were not unresponsive, we find no source of
 
i
nraediate funding for these projects.  In certain instances we found that
 
application deadlines have passed for funding in fiscal 1981.  Since it is
 
so close to the end of the fiscal year, most of the agencies contacted have
 
pledged or paid out their 1981 funds so would be unable to consider these
 
applications for funding within the next few months.
 
Few of the agencies with which we dealt are certain of their program budgets for
 
1982.  Many programs are being consolidated and some are being eliminated.  The
 
availability of 1982 funds for these projects is impossible to ascertain.  Given the
 
start up dates of these projects, Federal Council staff believes the National
 
Endowment for the Arts to be the only source of federal funding available for them at
 
this time.  The three projects appear to staff to fall well within the guidelines of
 
National Endowment for the Arts programs which have chosen to reca mend them for
 
funding.

A Federal agency advised by t
he
 
National Council on t
he Arts
 
From:  Bess Lomax Hawes / Folk Arts Program
 
Subject:  Proposed Grants to Lettumplay (
grant #12-5530-193, $5,820)
 
and University of
. Alaska, Juneau Campus (
grant #12-5530-223, $26,660)
 
The Council's reluctance to recommend t
he above grants at the August meeting
 
is most t
roubling t
o Folk Arts.  We had felt t
hat both grants served a number
 
of Endowment goals:  both grants were targeted towards making quality art
 
accessible to a wide audience; both grants concerned preserving our national
 
heritage, a heritage that encompasses t
he artistic contributions of our
 
multi-cultural citizenry; both grants specified the participation of artists
 
of nationally recognized talents and of undisputed artistic achievement.
 
Lettumplay is a Washington, D
.C. based community arts organization often
 
funded through Expansion Arts.  The grant funds were largely budgeted to
 
pay the artist's salary.  The artist involved, Charley Sayles, has been
 
featured in Smithsonian Folklife Festival concerts for the past four years;
 
he has performed for President and Mrs. Carter at the White House; his
 
photograph appears on Folk Arts' Apprenticeship leaflet.  Mr. Sayles is a
 
master musician on the harmonica; I do not believe I have ever heard a more
 
virtuoso technician and here I include Larry Adler, to whom Pete Seeger and
 
I recently referred Mr. Sayles with a letter of introduction.
 In many ways
 
this project was designed to try to get Mr. Sayles some money.  He works
 
often as a street musician, sometimes by choice, sometimes by necessity;
 
steady work for a harmonica virtuoso is not perhaps the easiest to come by.
 
His workshops in Lorton have been highly praised.
 
The University of Alaska at Juneau project presents us with an even more
 
serious problem.  The Folk Arts panel had deferred this application from an
 
earlier meeting because they wanted more information as t
o the seriousness
 
of the artistic component and t
he stature of t
he artists to be involved.
 
Panel notes disclose that t
he panel requested definitive information that
 
this would be a residency, not a series of classes, that Native artists of
 
stature would be employed, not "crafts specialists", that there would be no
 
smell of busy-work about the project.  They were more than satisfied.  The
 
list of prospective artists (
one full-time Artist in Residence together with
 
six additional artists for short-term residencies) includes a number of
 
distinguished artists and artisans of Eskimo, Athabaskan, Tlingit and Aleut
 
-
'2 =
 
background, one of whom has served on the Alaskan State Council for the
 
Arts.  The art forms t
o be demonstrated include Eskimo cottonwood carving,
 
ivory and soapstone carving, silver'engraving, and Tlingit mask-making
 
among others.  Week-long conferences involving several artists discussing
 
and demonstrating Tlingit design and art history, North-west Coast Indian
 
art and design, and Eskimo art history and design attest to the seriousness
 
with which this program has been planned.  We have support letters not
 
only from prison officials but from artists interested in participating and
 
from native arts organizations.
 Our funds are being matched with cash at
 
nearly t
hree t
o one.  Frankly, I don't
. know quite what t
o say in a letter
 
of rejection.  This project has been carefully planned t
o meet programmatic
 
and Endowment guidelines, a great number of people have been involved, a
 
great deal of thought and prayerful planning has gone into it.
 
My own belief is t
hat t
hese are good applications, t
he second certainly
 
stronger than t
he first, but both of t
hem firmly within Folk Arts' mandate,
 
as I have understood i
t.
 I would greatly appreciate your assistance in
 
this matter at the earliest possible t
ime since 1981 monies are involved.

APPLICATIONS: 
Auxiliary to Bellevue Medical Center, Inc./N.Y.
 
Lettumplay - Washington, DC
 
University of Alaska - Juneau Campus
 
Our National Council's referral of the above applications to the Federal Council
 
on the Arts and Humanities is of deep concern to me.
 The brief synopses in the
 
Council book do not adequately describe these programs.  Perhaps with this
 
additional information, the Council will reconsider their recommendation.
 
In regard to Bellevue Medical Center's application to Expansion Arts, I met with
 
Ms. Connie Solomon, Assistant Treasurer, on March 3rd in my office, and later
 
visited with Ms. Denny Levy, Director of Arts Programs, at the Institution on
 
June 3rd.
 Before coming to Bellevue, Ms. Levy worked at the Whitney Museum as
 
Director of Writers.
 
Ms. Levy is developing a comprehensive arts program in the Institution which in-
cludes an outdoor sculpture garden/program.  This is being done in cooperation
 
with the Artists Representing Environmental Art, and they have acquired three
 
sculptures by Richard Stankiewicz and a large wooden sculpture by Linda Fleming.
 
In addition, our Visual Arts Program awarded a grant to Bellevue for additional
 
artwork by Mr. Stankiewicz (
see attached).
 
This particular application for NEA funding involves three artists, who were
 
selected by a panel composed of William T
. Williams, Christian Rohlfing, and
 
Enrico Donati (
see attached information concerning panelists).
 The artists were
 
then approved by Bellevue's very impressive Arts Board (membership list attached).
 
The artists would conduct workshops for three groups--older adults, children,
 
and inmates.
 Additionally,  the artists will design and complete murals on
 
several wall spaces.
 
I am very impressed with Ms. Solomon and Ms. Levy's work to bring the arts to
 
this institution.  Most important,  they have carefully and expertly planned this
 
project to assure quality arts programming.
 
As with the Folk Arts projects,  this project meets Endowment guidelines, and it
 
is a superb program involving excellence in the arts.
 
Applications, page 2
 
The National Council has long been committed to making the arts accessible to
 
special constituencies.
 In 1977 the Council reaffirmed its 1973 Resolutions
 
that:
 
"No citizen should be deprived of the beauty and insights
 
into the human experience that only the arts can impart,"
 
and again, charged the Endowment to "insure access to the
 
arts for all special constituencies" stating that "The Arts
 
are a right, not a privilege, of all Americans".
 
As you know, our work in this area began years before the Endowment was mandated
 
to develop'504 Regulations for grantees.
 
Our National Council on the Arts and the Endowment have served as the leader in
 
the area of access to the best, not only to the state and community arts organ-
izations but to other Federal and state agencies.  The Endowment's efforts have
 
continued to be exemplary.
