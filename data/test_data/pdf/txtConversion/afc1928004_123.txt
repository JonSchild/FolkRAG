HARK! HARK! THROUGH 'THE WILD WOOD. 
Tyrolese war song,—Sung hyMADA3m VKsTats. 
They conic through the wild wood, 
I 
hear their warrior strain ; 
The haunts of their childhood 
Allure their steps again. 
I 
see their glittering spears afar, 
I 
hail the glorious voice of war, 
The sunbeams on their motions glance 
And quiver o'er each sparkling lance, 
I 
see their glittering spears afar, 
I 
hear the glorious voice of war, 
hark ! hark ! through the wild wood, 
I 
hear the martial strain. 
Oh I 
let not tears our welcome speak, 
Or cloud affection's brow; 
Tears genun'd at parting every cheek, 
But smiles should greet them now. 
Twine round their heart your spells of power, 
Home, peace, and love I 
Through weary life's long future hour, 
No more, no more to rove. 
I 
see their glittering spears afar, 
I 
hail the glorious voice of war, 
Hark ! hark I 
through the wild wood, 
hesounds the martial qrain. 
EVANGELINE. 
She is lost to us for ever, 
And we look for her in vain, 
She is gone and we shall Dever 
See that angel face again. 
Alas, that one so lovely, 
Should perish like the flowers, 
Yet now she brooms unfailing, 
In a brighter land than ours. 
Site was lovelier than the glowing, 
Of the morning's rosy beam, 
A d light seemed round her flowincY 
Like the radiance of a 
dream. 
Se faded from our vision. 
Like a 
calm sweet slimmer day, 
But the itnagv of her beauty, 
Shall never pass away. 
0331 GIVE 'ME WINGS TO FLY AWAY,, 
Oh I 
Give tne wings to fly away, 
To the tlear-old southern land, 
Where fire-flies flit like roving stars, 
In many a 
glittering band, 
For there I 
see.the faces 
Of those that love me well, 
And hear the good old music, 
From friendly voices swell. 
-CHORUS. 
1011! give me wings to fix away 
Where the humming- birds are singing, 
Where time sun shines bright and the hearts are light, 
And the merry tones are ringing. 
I 
wander therein hours of sleep, 
So real each vision seems, 
I 
wake, alas with breaking heart, 
To mourn my beauteous dreams. 
And wonder while I'm weeping, 
If the world holds a 
wind, 
Will once more waft me back, 
When my heart is left behind. 
Oh I 
give me wings, &c.

FAME. 
By S. TROAVBRIDGE. 
As we journey on in life, through this world of care and strife, 
How many we see try to gain renown, 
But ' tis very oft the case, the undeserving win the race, 
And fortune on the hest will sometimes frown. 
Men gifted you will find, very seldom, bear in mind, 
'Tis no easy task to gain an honest name, 
Pure talent may abound, bat perseverance must be found, 
If you wish to reach the height of ladder's fame. 
Then on, boys, on, but keep a 
steady pace, 
If you wish to gain a 
true and honest name, 
Pure talent may abound, but perseverance must be found, 
To reach the topmost round of ladder's fame-
How many men we see an ornament would be, 
To England if they only persevere, 
With gifts possessed by few, but courage not quite true, 
They give way directly obstacles appear; 
But other men we see, less talented will be, 
Trying hard a 
high position to obtain; 
bride 
They make bright hope their guide, turn their back on foolish 
'Till at hat they reach the top of ladder's fame. 
Then on, boys. on, & c, 
Now it you would gain fanye and a 
thorough honest name, 
Do that which is.done by very few, 
If you first attempt in vain, persevere and try again, 
have courage and determination too, 
Always be an upright man,and do all the good you can, 
And if a 
rival you should have do not fear, 
If you keep a 
steady pace you've a 
chance to win the race,,_ 
So always do your best, and persevere. 
Theo, on boys on„&c. 
GIVE ME BACK MY CHANGE: 
Ant--"Portant Par La Sync." 
Oh deep old file of Saffron Bill, 
The coat I 
bought-of thee ; 
And which you charged me ten bob for 
A Quid, I 
gave to thee. 
You say 'twas only half a 
soy., 
But I 
don't act so strange ; 
Ten in your pocket dip your paw, 
And give um back ills change. 
You shrewd old Israelite come tip 
The cash that's to me due ; 
I 
have not come 'from Yorkshire now, 
To chizzled be by you. 
You say " Pon honor, Sar " to me, 
A nd qleem my language strange; 
But in your pocket tip your paw, 
And give me back my change. 
You call your thieving sect around, 
But Moses that won't do; 
I 
won't believe a 
word they'll say, 
They're liars all, like you; 
I'll have my cash or have your beard, 
Nay do not deem it strange, 
'Tis well that with that wizen'd paw, 
You give me back my ehange-
ALL'S WELL. 
Deserted by the waning moon, 
When skies proclaim night's cheerless noon, 
On tower, fort. or tented ground. 
The sentry walks his lonely round. 
And should some loot- step haply stray, 
'Where can ion marks the guarded way, 
Who goes there / 
Stranger, quickly tell— 
A friend!— 
Good night I 
All, all's well. 
Or. sailing 03 the midnight deep, 
While weary messmates soundly sleeping, 
The careful watch patrols the deck 
To gnarl the ship from foes or wreck ; 
And, while his thoughts oft homeward veer, 
Some ffiendlv voice salutes his ear— 
What cheer I Brother, quickly tell, 
Above— 
Below— 
Good night 
All, all's well:

'HE 11IG WALL-FLOWER, 
There was a 
sort of kind of grace, 
About a 
girl I 
met, 
She wore a 
shawl of oritnge lace, 
Her hair was in a 
net. 
I 
met her in a 
railway train, 
When going down to Kew; 
If I 
don't see that girl again, 
Whate'er shall I 
do.—Oh. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
felt just as happy as a 
big wallflower, 
Or any plant you like to show me, 
But ever since that day, I've fallen so away, 
That my shadow would never know me, 
I 
spoke to her, she spoke to me, 
And blushed a 
lovely yellow, 
"Oh,—go along, you are," said she 
'An impudent young fellow." 
I 
treated her to shrimps and tea, 
And paid without demur, 
And cruelly she treated time, 
When 1 
had treated her—Oh. 
For I 
felt just as happy, ctc. 
Oh, 'twas in an arbor quite apart, 
I 
went down on my knees, 
And offered her my hand and heart 
And said, " Oh, have me please; 
She let me stay toy knees upon 
That cruellest of Belles_ 
She knew that I 
was kneeling on 
Sharp periwinkle shells— Oh. 
For I 
felt just as happy, ttc. 
At last she stid, " it cannot was, 
Oh, no it must not be." 
I 
asked her why ? she said, " Because, 
I'm married, don't you see.' 
I 
fled away and since that day, 
I've grown so thin, I 
fear 
If I 
keep shrinking in this way, 
I 
soon shall disappear— Oh. 
For I 
felt just as happy, &c.

HULL'S VICTORY.: 
It oftimes has been told, 
That the British seamen bold, 
Could beat the tars of France, neat and handy, 0 
r 
But they never found iheir match. 
Till the Yankees did them catch, 
For the Yankee tars for fightiug are the dandy, 0 
t 
0, the Guerriere so bold, 
On the foaming ocean roli'd, 
Commanded by Dacres the grandee, 0 
I 
With as choice a 
British crew 
As a 
rammer ever drew, 
They could beat the Freenhmen two to one, so handy, 0 
When this frigate hove in view, 
" 
0," says Dacres to his crew, 
" 
Prepare ye for action, and be bandy, 0: 
On the weather-guage we'll get her, 
And to make the men fight better, 
We will give to them gunpowder and good brandy, 0." 
Now this boasting Briton cries, 
" lake that Yankee ship your prize; 
You can, in thirty minutes, do it handy, 0 
r 
Or in twenty-five. I'm sure ; 
If you'll do it in a 
score, 
give you a 
double Flare of good brandy, 0 
" 
When prisoners we've made them,

OUR UNION, RIGHT OR WRONG." 
Words by S. S. STEEL. 
Music by FREDERICK BUCK, JR. 
Rouse, hearts of Freedom's only home I 
Bark to disunion's cry, 
Dear liberty beneath her dome. 
Proclaims that danger's nigh ; 
Come let your noble shouts ring forth, 
In trumpet voices strong 
"We know no South, we know no North, 
Our Union right or wrong." 
We know no South, we know no North, 
Our Union right or wrong." 
The temple our brave Father's made 
The wonder of the world, 
Shall they behold their sons dismay'd 
When treason's flag's unfurled ; 
Oh, Never, by the glorious stars 
Which on our banner throng; 
Rouse, sons of three victorious wars, 
For Union right or wrong. 
Our patriot Father's shades, 
With Washington on high 
Point to their blood-anointed blades 
And to their children cry, 
Rouse, freemen by your Fathers' scars, 
On to the rescue throng; 
Defend our flag and sacred stars, 
The Union right or wrong. 
Sons of the press proclaim its worth, 
In telegraphic fires, 
Bid young America stand forth, 
And emulate their sires; 
Wake sister states and hand in hand, 
Round Freedom's Temple throng, 
Come shout in one united band, 
Our Union right or wrong. 
MAGGIE BY MY SIDE. 
By S. 
C. FOSTKR-
The land of my home is Dting, 
Flitting from my vi,w, 
A 
gale in the sail is sitting, 
r1'115 the merry crew; 
Byre let my home be, 
On the waters wide, 
I 
roam with a 
proud heart, 
Maggie's by my side, 
CHORUS. 
My own love, Maggie dear, 
Sitting by in 
side, 
Maggie dear, in 
own love, 
Sitting by my side. 
The wind howling o'er the billow, 
From the distant lea, 
The storm raging round my pillow, 
Brings no care to me; 
Roll on, ye dark waves, 
O'er the troubled tide, 
I 
heed not your anger, 
Maggie's by my side. 
My own love, Sr 
Storms can appal me never, 
While her brow is clear, 
Fair weather lingers ever, 
Where her smiles appear; 
When sorrow's breakers, 
'Round my heart shall bide, 
Still may I 
find her, 
Sitting by my side. 
My own love, &a 
HEARTS AND HOMES. 
By BLOCK LEY. 
Hearts and homes, sweet words of pleasure, 
Music breathing as ye fall: 
Making each the other's treasure, 
Repeat. 
Once divided, losing all. 
Homes, ye may be high or lowly, 
Hearts alone can make you holy, 
Be the dwelling e'er so small— 
Having love, it buasteth all. 
Hearts and Homes, sweet words revealing, 
All most good and fair to see, 
Fitting shrines of purest feeling, 
Temples meet to bend the knee, 
Infant hands bright garlands wreathing, 
happy voices incense breathing, 
Emblems fair of realms above, 
" 
For love is Ilea v'n. and lleav'n is love." 
Hearts and Homes, sweet words, &C. 
LULA IS OUR DARLING PRIDE. 
Lula is our darling pride, 
Lula bright. Lula gay; 
Dancing lightly at our side, 
All the livelong day. 
Not a 
bird that wings the air, 
Soaring to the sun, 
Freer is from every care, 
Than our darling one. 
As the flowers of early spring, 
Seemed more gay, seemed more bright, 
As their perfume first they fling, 
Fragrant at our feet ; 
So though others loved there be, 
Blooming in our bower, 
Lulu wins our heart, for she 
is our loveliest flower. 
When the clouds of trouble come, 
Lulu soothes all our care ; 
Ah I 
how dark would be our homa, 
Were not Lulu there 
Lulu, with her sunny 
Cheering every heart, 
Till each trouble she beguiles, 
And the clouds depart. 
GENTLE JENNY GRAY,. 
My heart is sad, I'll tell you why, 
If you'll listen to my lay, 
It makes me weep when I 
sing, 
Of my gentle Jenny Gray ; 
But I 
never can forget the day, 
When, with Jenny by my side, 
We talked of love and happiness, 
When she would be my bride.

Hush the banjo, toll the knell, 
I 
am very sad to-day, 
I 
cannot work, so let inc weep, 
For gentle Jenny Gray. 
My Jenny had the sweetest face, 
With eyes of sparkling jet. 
Her lips were like the full-blown rose, 
She was my darling pet; 
But death it came while she was sleeping, 
And stole my love away, 
And left me here so lonely weeping, 
For gentle Jenny Gray. 
Hush the banjo, dm. 
Down in the ground they laid her, 
Close by my cabin door, 
A simple stone now marks the spot, 
Where she sleeps to wake no more; 
While at her grave I'm lonely weeping, 
At the close of every day,

fancy that my love's bst sleeping, 
And not dead my Jenny Gray. 
Hush the banjo, dm.

CHARGE THE CAN CHEERILY. 
Now coil up your nonsense 'bout England's great navy, 
And take in your slack about oak hearted tars ; 
For frigates as stout, and as gallant crews have we, 
Or how came her Macedon deck d 
with our stars? 
Yes, how came her Guerriere, her Peacock and Java, 
All sent broken ribb'd to Old Davy of late ? 
How came it ? why, split me ! than Britons we're braver, 
And that shall they feel, too, wherever we meet. 
CHORUS. 
Then charge the can cheerily, 
Send it round merrily ; 
Here's to our country and captains commanding ! 
To all who inherit of Lawrence the spirit, 
"Disdaining to strike while a 
stick is left standing." 
Nay, if unawares we should run (a 
fresh gale in) 
Close in with a 
squadron, we'd laugh at 'ern all ; 
We'd tip master Bull such a 
sample of sailing, 
As should cause him to fret like a 
pig in a 
squall. 
We'd show the vain boaster, of numbers superior, 
Though he and his slaves at the notion may sneer; 
In skill, as in courage, to us they're inferior— 
For the longer they chase us, the less we've to fear. 
Then charge the can, & c. 
But should a 
razes be espied ahead nearly, 
To fetch her we'd crowd every stich we could make ; 
Down chests and up hammocks, would heave away cheerly, 
And ready for action would be in a 
shake. 
For her swaggering cut, though, and metal not caring, 
Till up with her close should our tire be withheld ; 
Then pour'd in so hot, that her mangled crew, fearing 
A trip to the bottom, should speedily yield. 
Then charge the can, &c. 
Britannia, although she beleaguers our coast, now, 
The dread of our wives and our sweethearts as well; 
Of " ruling the waves," has less reason to boast, now, 
As Dacres, and Carden, and Whinvates can tell. 
Enroll'd in our annals, live Hull and D-catur, 
Jones, Lawrence, and Bainbridge, Columbia's pride; 
The pride of our navy, which, sooner or later, 
Shall on the wide ocean triumphantly ride. 
Then charge the can, ctc.

Like the ocean tides, at our head he rides, 
The fearless Mad Anthony Wayne!

Down falls the starthd foe ; 
And many a

Shall never meet the blaze of the broad sunlight,

CHORUS. 
And many a 
red coat here to- night, 
The Continentals scorning, 
Shall never meet the blaze of the broad sunlight, 
That shines on the morrow morning. 
Was there e'er a 
chief, of his speech so brief, 
Who utters his wishes so plain ? 
Ere he speaks a 
word, the orders are heard 
From the eyes of Mad Anthony Wayne ! 
Aim ! tire I 
exclaim his eyes ; 
Bang 1 
bang ! each gun replies. 
And many a

It is best to fall at our country's call. 
If we must leave this life-time of pain; 
And who would shrink from the perilous brink, 
When led by Mad Anthony WayLe? 
Ran I

the bugles sound ; 
Our forces till the ground. 
And many a 
red coat, &s. 
Let them form their ranks in afirm phalanx— 
It will melt at our rifle-ball rain; 
Every shot must tell on a 
red coat well, 
Or we anger Mad Anthony Wayne.

Now retreats the beaten foe. 
And many a

Shall never meet the blaze of the broad sunlight, 
That shines on the morrow morning, 
BOUNDING BILLOWS. 
Bounding billows, cease your motion,. 
Bear me not so swiftly o'er ; 
Cease thy roaring, foamy ocean, 
I 
will tempt thy rage no more. 
Au I 
within my bosom beating, 
Varying passions wildly reign; 
Love, with proud resentment meeting, 
Throbs by turns with joy and pain. 
Proud has been my fatal passion, 
Proud my injured heart shall be ; 
'While each thought and inclination, 
&LI shall prove me worthy thee. 
Yet, believe, no servile passion 
Seeks to charm thy vagrant mind; 
Well I 
know thy 
Way'ring as the passing wind. 
Far I 
go, where fate may lead me, 
Far across the troubled deep ; 
Where no stranger's ear can heed me. 
Where no eye for me shall weep. 
Not one sigh shall tell my story, 
Not one tear my cheek shall stain ; 
Silent grief shall be my glory— 
Grief that stoops not to complain. 
When with thee, what ill could harm? 
Thou couldst every pang assuage; 
But, when absent, nought could charm— 
Every moment seem'd an age.

To gentle dames I

In briefest time, to those who were 
Some thousand miles away. 
"My father, comrade. you will tell 
About this bloody fray— 
My country's standard, say to him, 
\Vas safe with me to-day ! 
I've made a 
pillow of it now, 
On which to lay my head—

When I 
am with the dead. 
"I know ' twill grieve his inmost soul 
To think, that never more 
I'll sit with hint beneath the oak 
That shades his cottage door. 
But tell the time- worn patriot, 
That, mindful of his fame ; 
Upon this bloody battle- field 
I 
sullied not his name. 
"My mother's form is with me now, 
Her wail is on mine ear; 
And drop by drop as flows my blood, 
So drops from her the tear. 
Then, 0! when you shall tell to her 
The tidings of this day ; 
Speak softly, comrade, softly speak 
What you may have to say. 
"Speak not to her in hurried words 
The blighting news yen bear ; 
The cords of li e might snap too soon— 
So comrade have a 
care. 
I 
am her only, cherish'd child, 
But, tell her that I 
died; 
Rejoicing that she taught me young 
To take icy country's side. 
"But, comrade, there is one, I 
fain 
Once more would look upon; 
She lives upon the sloping hill 
That overlooks the lawn— 
The lawn, where I shall never more, 
In spring time's pleasant honrs; 
Go forth with her in merry mood 
To gather wood and flow ers. 
" 
Tell her, when death was on my brow, 
And life re ceding fast; 
Her voice, her form, her parting words, 
Were with me to the last.

Tell her I

Do they sit me a 
chair near the table, 
When ev'oing's home pleasures are nigh, 
s 
When the candles are lit in the parlor, 
And the stars in the calm azure sky? 
And when the " good nights" are repeated, 
And all lay them down to their sleep, 
Do they think of the absent, and waft me 
A whispered " good night," while they weep, 
A whispered " good night," while they weep? 
Do they miss me at home, do they miss me 
At morning, at noon, or at night? 
And lingers one gloomy shade around then, 
That only my presence can light? 
Are joys less invitingly welcome, 
And pleasures less hale than before, 
Because one is missed from the circle, 
Because I 
am with them no more, 
Because I 
am with them no more ?

THE HUNTER'S HORN. 
Swift from the covert the merry pack fled, 
While hounding, there sprang, over valley and mead, 
Vide spreading his antlers, erected his head, 
The stag, his enemies scorning. 
Oh, had you seen then through torrent, through brake, 
Each sportsman, right gallant, his rival race take, 
'Twould please beauty's ear to have heard echo wake, 
To the hunter's horn in the morning. 
Clear'd was the fOrest, the mountain pass'd o'er, 
Yet freshly their riders the willing steeds bore; 
The river rod ii deep where the stag spnrti'd the shore, 
Yet own'd no timorous warning. 
Si close was be fi)llow'd, the foam where he sprung 
Encircled and sparkled the coursers among, 
While the dogs of the chase their rude melody rung 
To the hunter's horn in the morning. 
IN EVERY FERTILE VALLEY. 
In every fertile valley, 
Where nature spreads the grass; 
Her silly conduct rally 
To every lad and lass. 
Where weary reapers labor, 
With Sylvia gay be seen, 
Or to the pipe and tabor, 
Light tripping o'er the green. 
When coivslips, sweetly smiling, 
Bedeck the verdant shade; 
Appear, the hours Leguiling, 
Or head some gay parade. 
Pursue these methods boldly, 
Nor sink in hopeless grief— 
The fair, once treated coldly, 
Will quickly grat.t relief,

Scenes that are brightest,

Hearts ‘‘ Iiich are lhddest, 
And eves that smile : 
Yet o'er them, above us, 
Tho' nature beam, 
With none to love us, 
How sad they seem, 
With none to love us, 
How sad they seem. 
Words cannot scatter, 
The thoughts we fear, 
For though they flatter, 
They mock the ear. 
Hopes will s

With fearful cost, 
And when they leave us,7 
The heart is lost.

THE SAILOR'S RETURN. 
A 
SEQUEL TO 
BLACK-EYED SUSAN. 
The moon had burst the clouds of heaven, 
When Susan sought the wreck-strewn 
By grief and woe 11(.1. bosom riven, 
Her 
sbipwreck'd William to deplore. 
While gazing, on the watery waste, 
A floating form her eve descried, 
And the next heaving billow [ laced 
Her lover by the maiden's side. 
"Susan, for thee the storm I 
braved, 
While angry surges round me roar'd, 
And see, by bounteous mercy saved, 
Thy sailor to thine arms restored !" 
Hi s we ll_k i,,, wn yoke bee fears beguiled, 
his glowing kiss her sorrows dried ; 
And the next mornine-'s sunbeams smiled 
On Susan as her William's bride

THE PLAIN GOLD RING. 
He was a 
chief of low degree, 
A lady high and fair was she! 
She dropp'd a 
ring,— he raised the gem, 
'Twas rich as eastern diadem ! 
'Nay, as your mistress' trophy, take 
The toy, when next a 
lance you break.' 
He to the tourney rode away, 
And bore off glory's wreath ti it day. 
How did his artKeit bosom heat 
Wh.:n, hastening to that lady's feet, 
The wreath and ring he proudly laid, 
But, ` Keep them, youth.' that lady said, 
'Nay, gem so rich I 
mav not wear, 
Howe'er return a 
gift so rare,' 
'Dear youth, a 
plain gold ring,' she sigli'd 
'From you were worth the world beside!"

To chat and talk she took a

A rocky cliff with Ally, 
Alas she fell, he could not save, 
And she now sleeps in the valley; 
She now sleeps, itc.

Where stru-gled Jane O'Malley; 
Where the rock was cleft, her veil was left, 
And she now sleeps in the valley.

I 
should fall in love, 
But at last my heart is won, 
By a

She's the daughter of a

Lives thirty miles away, 
Where I 
met this little charmer, 
In the month of May.

Then I'm in love with Alice, 
She's such a

I 
really think that Alice, boys, 
is fit for any Earl; 
Yes, I'm in love with Alice, 
From hey I'll never part, 
I 
feel so very happy since„ 
She stole away my heart 
Now of all the girls I've seen, 
And that's not very few, 
My charmer is the queen, 
She is so kind and true; 
I'm sure there is not many girls, 
With quality so rare, 
Blue eyes with teeth like pearls, 
And rich auburn hair. 
Then I'm in love, &c. 
If you search- I 
will be bound, 
There's not another lass, 
For twenty miles around, 
My Alice to surpass:: 
If necessary I 
would give, 
The best part of my life, 
If the rest I 
could but live, 
With Alice for my wife.

And the cue I'll mention in my song, is the honest workingman. 
For we are not Toffs nor Immensicoffs, 
Nor one of the upper ten, 
But we belong to the glorious band,, 
That is called the working men. 
Seine pride themselves upon their Wealth, and. station high fn.

A monied match they always hatch wheneeer they take a 
wife, 
But if true love and virtue should be recorded in the plan, 
As good as any countess, boys, is the wife of a 
working man-. 
For we are not, dre. 
If misfortune should at any time, bring the rich man down,

Then wh:.t Lord or Duke, to speak the truth, can equal the

I'm wounded and sorrowful, far from my home, 
'Sick among strangers, uncared for, unknown,

Are silent, aud swiftly are taking their wing; 
No one but mother can cheer me to-day, 
No one for me can so fervently pray, 
None to console me, no !dui friend is neclr, 
Mother would comfort me if she were here. 
Gently her hand on my forehead she'd press, 
frying to free me from pain and distress ; 
Kindly she'd say to me, " Be of good cheer, 
Mother will comfort you, mother is bore." 
Cheerfully, faithfully, mother would stay, 
Always beside me, by night or by day, 
If I 
should murmur or wish to complain, 
Tier gentle voice would soon calm Inc again. 
Sweetly a 
mother's love shines like a 
star, 
Brightest in darkness, when daylight's afar, 
In clouds or in sunshine, in pleasure or pain, 
A mother's affection is always the same. 
Gently her hand,

If she were with me, I 
should forget 
My pains and my sadness, no more would I 
fret,

Gently her hand on my forehead she'd press, 
Trying to free me from pain and distress, 
Kindly she'd any to me, " Be of good cheer," 
Mother would comfort me, mother is here,

Though changed yet constant still,

And sorrow marks my brow, 
Though years have passed and gons,

Though shame be on thy brow, 
And fortune favors ill, 
Though all forget thee now, 
Thy mother loves thee still. 
At the old tree in the lane, 
Methinks I

The broken vows proclaim, 
The grandeur I 
should share; 
Forgotten all alone, 
The one I 
loved has flown, 
And left me and the child, 
To face the cold world's frown. 
Though shame, ctc. 
In life's short rough career, 
Throu 411 folly and through vice,

And when fortune favors ill, 
When all would on us frown, 
Then a 
mother loves us still.

And outside she quickly got; 
She asked him bow he said his ware, 
He walked and mailed at her,

And I

was some hot ashes, which seemed to say  
All, hot, all hot. tt c.

For I

Just so, you know, or how we should 
When we feel as if as how we could. 
I 
met my fair one at a 
Ball, 
With her ( lanced till spooney grew, 
And squeezed her hand just so, you knows" 
But found out it was number two. 
For when I'd danced till out of breath, 
To sup it was just time to go, 
A chap walks up she takes his arm 
And off they go kis:, so, you know. 
And I 
felt, dtc. 
An old girl to the Supper Room, 
I 
had to take and on her wait, 
'While her spouse the Major stood

jealous state, 
So when the Ladies had retired, 
The tIftjorS face seetn'd in a 
glow, 
He said, 
you've made love to my wife, 
And down I 
went, just so, you know. 
And I 
felt, cEc. 
I 
found he'd blaclend both my eyes, 
So ran down stairs into the street 
And never stopp'd till I 
found out 
I'd knocked a 
Bobby off his beat: 
Who in a 
rage then said to me, 
For this assault, with me you'llgo 
Then took me to the Station House 
And locked me up just so, you know. And I 
felt, cl;c. 
The Magistrate next morning said, 
It was a 
very grievous fault, 
To have black eyes, and run so fast, 
And the policeman to assault; 
Five pounds is what you'll huye to pay, 
And hope that now you'll wiser grow, 
I

When home to bed just so, you know.

tell you of my Willie, stICli a 
jolly chap is he, 
I 
am so fond of Willie, and he's as fond of me ! 
We're going to be married that's if all thin o-4 go on right, 
And I 
shall be so happy when I 
am Mrs. White. 
He tells me that he loves me, and I 
believe it too, 
For I 
know my darling Willie, would never be untrue, 
That he will e'er deceive Inc. I'm not at all afraid, 
For he's a 
dashing fellow in the Fire Brigade! 
CI10111:S. 
Oh ! he's such a 
jolly fellow is my Willie White, 
With his hatchet by his side, and his helmet all so bright, 
Whene'er his duty calls him, he never is a 
fraicl, 
Like all the dashing fellows in the Fire Brigade I 
Some girls may like a 
soldier, or sailor, or marine, 
And some with a 
policeman may think themselves a 
queen. 
While some may say they'll only have a 
fellow with a 
trade, 
And some will say they'd rather live and the an old maid. 
But, I 
know this I 
can say, and I 
always speak my mind, 
A braver set of fellows I 
know you'll never find, 
In fact I 
mean to say, they throw all others in the shade, 
Those brave and dashing fellows in the Fire Brigade ! 
Ohl he's such a 
jolly fellow, cfre. 
But 'pon my word, sometimes, you know, l'm in a dreadful 
fright, 
To see the engines rushing by—it's a 
most alarming sight, 
I 
tremble for my Willie, and feel dreadfully afraid, 
For they run so many dangers in the Fire Brigade ! 
But then how dreadful it would be, when there are lives to save 
If there no one could be found who would the dangers brave, 
I 
think you must agree with me, they can't be too well paid, 
For they risk their lives for others in the Fire Brigade ! 
Oh I 
he's such a 
jolly fellow, dm. 
Then, may my Willie and his mates be. ready night and day, 
I'm sure when duty calls them, the call they 
vill obey, 
I'll ne'er believe the cry for help will e'er be^made in vain, 
They've proved themselves brave ledows, and so they will again. 
Then let us give them all a 
cheer— it's nothing more than right 
There's one I know deserves it 
well, and that's my Willie 
White. 
To go thro' fire arid water they never are afraid, 
Then hurra I 
for those brave fellows in the Fire Brigade I 
Oh 1

LIZZIE, THE POLISHER' DAUGHTER. 
Some time ago there used to dwell 
Some 
near Seabright St., 
Such a 
good tempered dear little girl, 
As in a 
days' walk you could meet. 
Her father he was a 
Polislier, by trade, 
And she worked at. the polishing too, 
I'm told seine money they made, 
But I 
tell this in secret now to you. 
cuorxs. 
Oh, my Lizzie dear, I 
love sincere, 
And that's the reason why I 
court 
She's a 
pretty girl you see, and she's very fond of me, 
Is Lizzie the Polisher's Daughter. 
Day after day I 
passed by the shop 
On purpose this charming girl to see, 
And sometimes at the window I'd make a 
full stop, 
For she had quite enraptured 111(4, 
How gently she varnished the carving I 
saw, 
And work her rubber with such ease and grace, 
There was never a 
time that I 
passed her door, 
But there was always a 
smile upon her face. 
Oh, my Lizzie dear, tEc. 
It so happened that I 
was a 
Polisher too, 
And went to work for her own father, 
So as 1 
could be near this dear girl it's true, 
For didn't I 
love her, 0 
rather. 
I'd laugh and I'd talk to her all the day long, 
For she seemed so happy and gay 
And sometimes I'd sing her a 
nice little song, 
Just to while the time away. 
Oh, my Lizzie dear, &e. 
One day when her father and mother was out, 
And there was no one at work in the shop, 
I 
scarcely knew what I 
was about, 
So the question at last 1 
ventured to pop. 
She blushed and she smiled, and hung down her head, 
When I 
asked her if she'd be my wife, 
The very next moment these words she said, 
"Ask Pa's consent, I'm yours for life." 
(Spoken.)—Well I 
got her father's consent, and we are going 
to be married at South Hackney Church next Monday morning. 
Oh, my Lizzie dear, dm 
her, 
SHE'D A DELICATE SORT OF WAY. 
Now I'm in love with a 
pretty little dove, 
Her name's Matilda Green, 
Her hair it, hangs in ringlets, 
And she's o 
ly seventeen. 
I 
met her out one summer's morn, 
When for a 
trip one day. 
Admired her because she had 
Such a 
delicate sort, of way. 
CIIORI7S. 
I 
raised my hat, her thus address'a, 
The morning's very fine. 
She raised her head and sweetly smiled, 
As I 
drew her arm in mine. 
We walked or talked for an hour or more, 
And found such lots to say, 
And 1 
felt quite enchanted with 
Her delicate sort of way-. 
She told the she was staying at 
A grand Hotel close by, 
Invited me to step inside, 
Says she, " you won't deny." 
Well in I 
went for Dinner there, 
And wine I 
had to pay, 
But how could I 
resist tier, 
And her delicate sort of way. [0h,such a 
pet,Acc,1 
I 
asked her to meet me the very next day, 
Says she" Indeed I 
will," 
And though she cruelly did deceive, 
I 
feel I 
love her still. 
Next day I 
went she was not there, 
But judge of my dismay, 
When I 
saw her out with another swell, 
In her delicate sort of way. [Oh, such a 
pet,ctc.] 
As I 
passed by she smiled and bowed, 
The fellow gave a 
grin, 
Then laughing very plainly proved 
How I'd been taken in. 
So now some other girl I'll find, 
And her addresses pay, 
But. I 
will have one who has not mot 
Such a 
delicate sort of way. [Oh, such a 
pet, Arc.]

LIFE'S LIKE E. SHIP. 
Life's like a 
ship in constant mot:on, 
Sometimes high and sometimes low, 
Where every one must brave the ocean, 
Whatsoever winds do blow ; 
If unassailed by squall or shower, 
Wafted by the gentle gales, 
Let's not lose the favoring hour, 
While success attends our sails. 
Or if the \vayward winds should bluster, 
Let us not give way to fear, 
But let us all our patience muster, 
And learn by reason how to steer; 
Let judgment keep you ever steady, 
'Tis a 
ballast never fails : 
Should dangers rise, be ever ready, 
To manage well the swelling sails. 
Trust not too much your own opinion, 
While your vessel's under weigh, 
Let good example bear dominion, 
That's a 
compass will not stray ; 
When thundering tempests make you shudder, 
or Bore as on the surface rails, 
Let good discretion guide the rudder, 
And Providence attend the sails. 
Then, when you're safe from danger riding, 
in some welcome port or bay, 
Hope be the anchor you confide in, 
And care a ,vhile to slumber lay ; 
Or when each can with liquor's flowing, 
And good fellowship prevails, 
Let each true heart, ‘‘ itli rapture glowing, 
Drink succe:ss unto our sails.

THE REASON ,WHY. 
Written by C. G. Anzgrr. 
I'll tell you how that fascinating ' Captain in the Blues," 
To me came wooing in a 
way no maiden could refuse— 
Ile swore I 
was " an angel," and he praised me to the sky, 
And if I 
half believed him, perhaps you know the reason why 
He'd fair Dundreary whiskers, large moustache, and auburn 
curls, 
And a 
wheedling sort of manner, vastly " taking" with the 
girls; 
ills family were very grand (he used to say) and I 
Looked kindly on the Captain ere I 
knew the reason why. 
And then he talked of marriage, and his " very large estate," 
His hounds, his horses, carriages, his opera- box and plate, 
lie pressed me hard to name the day and he the ring would 
buy. 
I 
straight complied but scarcely like to tell the reason why. 
It's very true, yet very strange that some who " cut a 
dash." 
Are often very singularly short of " ready cash"— 
This was the handsome Captain's case— Le hinted, on the s/y 
That he was " out of ready cash," But he didn't tell me why. 
He asked me for " a 
thousand—just to purchase the trousseau." 
I 
nibbled at the tempting bait—And let my money go; 
And front that moment to the present I 
have not set eye 
On those fair Dundreary whiskers and I 
guess the reason why,— 
I've seen a 
bill stuck on the walls, " One Hundred Pounds 
Reward." 
For that fascinating Captain who was to have been my lord, 
It seems ,that he has swindled other folks as well as I. 
So I 
still remain in single bliss and—you know thereason why,

By FREDERIC MACCAIIR, 
Of all the sources of delight, I'll tell, with pour permission,

It is to be the constant theme of ladies' conversation, 
And know that they have given him this flatt'riug appellation. 
Fine fellow I 
great swell ! 01 fascinating fellow I 
It is delightful to be called a 
fascinating fellow. 
I 
don't care what the men may think of me, to love or hate me, 
It all depends upon the term by which they designate me ; 
Among us modern, fashionable fellows, there are no men 
Who would object to such a 
complimentary cognomen. 
Fine fellow I 
great swell, &c. 
A man may be quite handsome, and yet not fascinating, 
It's in my style and winning ways I'm so insinuating; 
Of course I'm sometimes sneer'd at by the stupid, grave and 
serious, 
But to my reputation, that's in no way deleterious. 
Fine fellow! great swell, ckc. 
It's pleasing to n 
fellow's pride to be call'd " Lady-killer," 
And ' tis my greatest triumph, as a 
fascinating fellow, 
To see the ladies & tap their eyes, and watch them softly sighing. 
By jingo! that to me, is really very gratifying.

BATTLE OF THE KEGS. 
Gallants, attend, and hear a 
friend, 
Trill forth harmonious ditty— 
Strange things I'll tell which late befel 
In Philadelphia City. 
'Twas early day, as poets say, 
Just when the sun was rising; 
A soldier stood on lo 
of wood, 
And saw a 
sight surprising. 
As, in amaze, he stood to gaze, 
The truth can't be denied, sirs; 
He spied a 
score—of kegs, or more, 
Come floating down the tide, sirs. 
A sailor, too, in jerkin blue, 
The strange appearance viewing; 
First damn'd his eyes, in great surprise, 
Then said, " Some mischief's brewing. 
"These kegs now hold the rebels bold 
Packed up like pickled herring; 
And they're come down to attack the town, 
In this new way of ferrying." 
The soldier flew, the sailor, too, 
And, scared almost to death, sirs, 
Wore out their shoes to spread the news, 
And ran till out of breath, sirs. 
Now up and down, throughout the town, 
Most frantic scenes were acted; 
And some ran here, and some ran there, 
Like men almost distracted. 
Some fire cried, which some denied, 
But, said the earth had quaked; 
And girls a 
id boys, with hideous noise, 
Ran through the town half- naked.

Lay all this time a

Nor dream'd of harm, as he lay warm, 
Old Morpheus imploring. 
Now, in a 
fright he starts upright, 
Awaked by such a 
clatter; 
He rubs both eyes, and boldly cries,

For God's sake, what's the matter 
At his bedside he then espied

Upon one foot be had one boot, 
And t'other in his bands, sirs. 
"Arise I 
arise !" Sir Erskine cries: 
" 
The rebels—more's the pity— 
Without a 
boat, are all on float, 
And ranged before the city. 
"The motley crew, in vessels new, 
With Satan for their guide, sir ; 
Pack'd up in bags, or wooden kegs, 
Come driving down the tide, sir. 
Therefore, prepare for bloody war I 
These kegs must all be routed ; 
Or surely we despised shall be 
And British courage doubted."

All ranged in dread array, sirs;

The cannons roar from shore to shore, 
The small arms make a 
rattle; 
Since wars be--an, I'm sure no man 
E'er saw so strange a 
battle. 
The rebelf vales, the rebel dales, 
With rebel trees surrounded; 
The distant woods, the hills and floods, 
With rebel echoes sounded. 
The fish below swain to and fro, 
Attack'd from every quarter ;

Why, sure," thought they, " the devil's to pay

The kegs, 'tis said, though strongly mada 
Of rebel staves and hoops, sirs; 
Could not oppos e their powt,rful foes,

From morn to night these men of might, 
Displayed tunaEing courage; 
And when the sun was fairly down, 
Retired to sup their porridge. 
A hundred men, with each a

Or more— upon my word, sirs; 
It is most true— would be too few, 
Their valor to record, sirs. 
Such feats did they .perfortn that day

time, and it furnishes examples of every style worthy of imitation, or of being 
copied. 
It is fast superseding all the antiquated Letter-Writers that have 
long outlived their usefulness. 
So great is the sale of this excellent book that 
it may truly be said that since its publication, 
" 
Those write now who never wrote before, 
And those who always wrote, now write the more."
