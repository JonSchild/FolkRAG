bratodComedian, :‘ T. Fred Rob rts. 
It happened one afternoon, 
'Twas in the month of May; 
While walking with a 
pretty girl, 
1 
twits to her did say; 
Now ui 11 you go out for a 
row, 
The river to explore, 
She said she would, ' twould do her good, 
As she'd not been there before. 
Spoken. — And like a 
fool I 
hired a boat but, di-
rectly we got on the water, she made a 
grab at me and 
said 
Cnoans. 
Oh ! Fred, the boat is turning over, 
Oh ! Fred ! you naughty man, she cried; 
Oh ! Fred, I 
wish l'd thrown 
or over, 
Ere 1 
ever took her up the river for a 
ride, 
I 
pulled away with all my might, 
But we bad not gone far, 
pefore unit girl began to scream, 
And said she'd tell her 111d. 
THE BOAT IS ,. URNINO OVER. 
CONTINUED 
And as these words escaped her lips, 
A 
steamer came close by, 
Which caused our boat to pitch and toss, 
sad har again to cry — . Chorus. 
I 
felt uneasy in my mind, 
I 
scarce knew what to do; 
I 
thought that girl would die of fright, 
And so would all of you. 
She said, dear Fred, oh ! take me home, 
Here I 
cannot remain; 
And then there came another wave, 
Which made her shout again. 
Spoken.— Shout. " Well I 
should obliterate, to pro-
crastinate, shout." Chat was no:name for it, just imagine 
the horrible possition I 
was in, with my hands engaged 
with the two scullg of the-boat, and the one skull of an 
agitated and sea- sick younglady reclining on my manly 
chest, and nc chance for one to,obtain even a platonic 
hug without risking a 
cold water bath.--- She said, oh ! 
my, what would mamma_say if she knew I. was al, alone 
on these turbulent and tumultuous billows. 
I 
thonght 
that was pretty good for a 
girl that wasn't feeling well, 
so I 
tired her into the bottom of the boat, and made all 
steam for laud, and every time I 
felt inclined to weaken 
on the s 
roke, I 
heard a 
small puny voice that said— 
Ch orus. 
I'd Like to Make That Little Girl 
My Own. 
By E. C. Dunbar, 
Sold by him to Fred Roberts. 
I'm fond of pretty flowers that decorate the earth, 
And pread their sweetest of perfume far and near, 
I'm fond of pretty music that cheers the sad of heart, 
And pleases with softest charm the ear. 
I'm fond of pretty jewels,I don't care what they are, 
The diamond, the ruby or the pearl 
But I'll tell you what I'm fonder of, yes, fonder of by far, 
And that's a 
very pretty, pretty girl, 
And I 
have got a 
very pretty girl. 
She's as pretty as a 
bunch of early violets in the spring, 
As happy as a 
skylark singing on the wing, 
She's as fair as any fairy, and if I 
was a 
king, 
I'd like to make that little girl my own. 
In a 
pretty little cottage just underneath the hill, 
With roses and clematis all around, 
Beside the running brooklet that turns the water wheel, 
My pretty little violet's to be found. 
As artless as a 
maiden of sweet seventeen should be, 
i
Ter eyes as blue as heaven's sky alone. 
Her hair is bright and shining like a 
casket of gold, 
And the color of her cheek is all her own, 
The color's not laid an but nature's own. 
Chorus.

Something Rather Dangerous' 
Sung y 
the Lion Comic, Fred Roberts, up-wards of 300 times 
in New York City with great success. 
To while away' the time I 
will endeavor, 
Ily singing of a 
subject rather old, 
Alt hough upon the whole I .ITnow yyu never 
Are tired of hearing all that can be told. 
A1)out that very interesting matter 
Which poets all declare is heavenly bliss, 
And if you 11 not interrupt me with your chatter, 
I'll give my definition of a 
kiss, it is this— 
CHORUS. 
Something rather dangerous, something rather nice, 
Something very naughty, but it can't be called a 
vice, 
Many say it's nonsense, ethers think it's wrong, 
All agree it's jolly but it don't last long. 
WIH ,n 
first you go to court your little charmer, 
Vim fall upon your mats of bones and swear, 
That nothing in this world can ever harm her, 
II she'll consent your little home to share. 
Of course you vow you love her to distraction, 
But nothing gives such happiness as this. 
When you vedge your love with most appropriate 
action, 
She'll greet your fond affection with a, kiss, 
oh I 
what bliss, 
Spoken.—Kiss, bliss, bliss, kiss, I 
remember waiting 
for a 
girl in a 
field four hours once, for a 
kiss, but I 
did 
not get it. 
I 
got left, she didn't come. I wasn't long 
without a 
companion though, for something else came 
along in the shape of a 
mad bull, I 
looked at the bull, 
and as he wore horns I 
thought it advisable to ask him 
who was going over the fence first, him or me, he 
seemed to say I'll toss you for it, he tossed and won, it 
came down a head— my head— and after that it's a 
wonder that I 
am here to tell my own tale, ( tail) but 
I 
don't think I'll risk it any more even for the sake of--
Chorus.

Cerrdi 
This popular song was composed by G. w. Hunt of Low ion, 
England. Rewritten, and sung with unbounded applause 
by the peoples favorite Fred Roberts. 
To Brighton Beach races a 
short time ago, 
I 
took a 
young lady who called me her beau; 
Now she was a 
blonde, or at least she'd blonde hair, 
And lived with her grandma on Madison Square. 
Her hair must be false, for it seemed very s range, 
Every week from a 
blonde to a 
brunette she'd change, 
in spite of that fact, I 
still thought her divine, 
For in looks and in style she was quite superfine. 
CHORUS. 
Cortina was beautiful, Cerulia was fair, 
And lived with her grandma on Madison square, 
She was once my hunkydoodledum. but now, alas. she 
Plays the kissey-kissey with an officer in the U. S. Navy 
One night to a 
party this girl I 
did take, 
And quite a 
sensation Cerulia did make, 
A 
U. S. sea captain with her fell in love, 
I 
called her an angel a 
duck and a 
dove, 
I 
asked her to waltz but she gave me no chance, 
And with this jack tar all night she did dance, 
With envy my poor brain did whirl, 
For the sea- captain captured this false hearted girl. 
CERUL1A. 
CONTINUED. 
Spoken.—Bnd yet, notwithstanding her treachery, I 
had to admit that 
Chorus. 
And when with her captain she walks down the street, 
As bad luck will have it, we oft chance to meet, 
Through the eye-glass I 
bought her at me she will stare, 
While the c 
ptain assumes a 
most elegant air, 
With the fin ers I 
loaded with jewels and rings, 
She th naps the piano for the captain and sings, 
I 
asked when I 
met her out wrIking one day, 
Why like a 
squeezed lemon you threw me away. 
Spoken. -- In answer to.my question as to why she 
gave me the grand bounce, she said she felt.o. little fresh 
and took an old salt to cure her. 
I 
asked her when the 
captain went to sea, if I 
might call and see her, 
She 
said she'd see about it as the captain was an old tar, 
and if she didn't stick he'd pitch her overboard. 
I 
said, 
our great American Navy is slightly uncertain, and the 
washtub your noble captain commands might run up 
against a 
straw and sink. 
She said, well, the captain's 
life is insured for $50,000. and if the ship wants to sink, 
let her sink. 
I 
rushed from the place intending never 
to look on the face of woman again, but when I 
got home 
and calmly reflected over the matter, I 
had to acknowl-
edge that despite her very many faults—

Run For The Doctor, Charlie Dear. 
As sung by Fred Robert a. 
When I 
got married my wife she said, 
Mamma will live with us, 
I 
felt a 
strong objection, 
But I 
feared to make a 
fuss. 
But still he mother came alas ! 
I 
fear she'll never go, 
And the worst, oh ! dear, she's always queer, 
For evrey day or so. 
It's run for the Doctor, Charley dear, 
Mother's taken very queer, 
Go for your life for Dr. Crupp, 
If you fall down don't stop to get up 
Tell him she's got the old attack, 
Thingamy up and clown her back, 
Make haste, dear, or else I 
fear, 
She never will live till morning. 
My married life's a 
swindle, 
And my house a 
doctor's shop,

RUN FOR THE DOCTOR, CHARLIE DEAR. 
CONTINUED. 
There's nothing but bottles and nasty smells, 
Of physic from bottom to top. 
She's twenty bottles of physic a 
week, 
She's always taking pills, 
The Doctors pay her visits, 
And I 
pay the doctor's bills. 
sl,o1;en. — When I remonstrate with the old lady 
itbout the amount of money she costs for Dr,. medicine 
(•te, may wife rings all the bells, and shouts all over the 
Louse— 
Chorus. 
Since she's been in our house, 
I've been a 
wretched bachelor, quite, 
I 
only see my wife of a 
day, 
She's with her mother all the night, 
Sometimes I 
go to sleep and dream, 
I'm settled in paradise, 
But the wife soon comes and pulls me oat, 
And the weather's cold as ice, 
Spoken.- 
Ves, my wife pulls me out on the cold floor 
and shouts in my ear---
Waiting to Meet Pretty Mart. 
Written and sung by Fred Roberta. 
My appearance no doubt, will denote that I 
am 
A 
genuine upper ten swell; 
And off from the city in summer I 
go, 
And in some country village to dwell. 
I've met many beauties at home and abro id, 
But the fairest that yet I've seen, 
'Twas a 
young country belle who all girls did excel, 
' 
iwas Mary, My sweet village queen. 
CHORUS. 
I 
call her my own pretty Mary, 
And she is the pride of the dairy 
The fairest e'er seen is my own village queen, 
And soon she'll belong .0 
me. 
I 
ye traveled through Italy and sweet sunny France, 
I've seen the fair daughters of Spain, 
On the banks of the Rhine l've drank German wine, 
When weary returned home again. 
Fair women I've met in all foreign lauds, • 
WhoSe beauty a 
hermit would charm. 
But none had the grace or the sweet pretty face, 
Of Mary the pride of the farm. 
Chorus. 
With eyes full of sunshine and red rosy cheeks, 
And teeth like a 
pearlet so rare, 
Her charms come from nature without aid of art, 
With my Mary ther.-•'s none can c 
mpare. 
So tired of he beauties whose charms men deceive, 
I 
said that no longer I'd ro 
SO 
away from the to n 
I've now settled down 
With my sweet Mary t

When the Bird8 Have Gone to Sleep. 
Over the Neighbors Fence. 
'Composed and sung by WiwAst A. 
HUNTLEY. 
Writ ten and sung by Fred Roberts. 
A 
farmer's daughter I 
used to spark, 
Over the neighbor's fence: 
But when I'd go ! hero it was always dark, 
Over the neighbor's fence. 
For the farmer owned a 
loaded gun, 
And the bull dog after mo did run, 
Bitmg my pantoloons till I 
had none, 
Over the neighbor's fence. 
Cuoints. 
Over the farmer's wall I 
went like a 
cannon ball, 
With a 
sort of a 
thud I 
fell in the mud, 
But the bull dog had the call. 
Over the nelghbor's fence, 
It cast me just eighty cents 
My pants to repair I 
saw half of them thero 
On top of the neighbor's fence 
I 
h•llered " police," and I 
shouted for help, 
Over the neighbors fence, 
But the canine answered with a 
yelp. 
Over the neighbor's fence. 
I 
was all hit tp from my head to my heels, 
I 
cannot well tell yon how badly it feels, 
But I 
have to stand up to etv, my meals, 
Since climbing the neighbors fence. 
I'll lay for that do< , both night and day, 
Over the neighbor's fence, 
I'd like to kill him if I 
get him away 
Over the neighbor's fence, 
But while he's there and full of fight, 
With big long teeth that lon{, to bite, 
You'll never catch me out late at night, 
Climbing the neighbor's fence. 
Chorus, 
Over the neighbor's fence, 
The bull dog looks immense, 
I 
w- s 
bit up :Jo much I 
walked on a 
crutch, 
And cussed the neighbo:s fence, 
Over the neiglibors fence, 
it taught me a 
little sense. 
l'm plastered and sewed like a " c.nduroy " ii eel 
Damn the old fartner's fence. 
Chorus. 
Chorus. 
When the roses bud and blossom 
By the rippling river side, 
'Where they gently nod and listen 
To the music of the tide : 
While the early stars are shining, 
In the far-off azure deep, 
Come to meet me, dearest darling, 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
CHORUS. 
Come to meet me, dearest darling, 
Where the shadows softly creep, 
in the calm and peaceful twilight, 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
How I 
long to hear von whisper 
All the story of our love, 
With nobody very near us 
Save the leaflets up above. 
Sweetest words to thee addressing. 
Loving arms around me creep, 
Could we evermore thus linger 
When the birds have gone to sleep.

Is 
Sophia-phia-phia. 
Insult it, " Who Dare." 
written and sung with tremendous succees by the ee. 
brated Comedian, Mr. Fred Roberts. 
There is a 
very pretty girl whom I 
admire, 
.t.nd her name's Sophia, she's sweet as briar, 
I 
only wish at present too, that I 
was nigh her, 
For my heart always is with Sophia. 
CuoRus. 
So-phi-a- phi-a- phi-a, 
Is the girl that I 
zel m 
ire, 
For her love I 
do aspire, 
And if it I 
could acquire. 
A piano 1
. would buy lo. r, 
On the three years system hire, 
Or on the battlefie:d xpire, 
For So-phia-phia-phia 
tihe's very shy in fact I 
never saw one shyer, 
For when I 
stand by her she will blush like fire, 
With every luxury in life by jove I'd supply her, 
if I 
had but the love of Sophia. 
Ifer father made his money as a 
cleaner and dyer, 
And is going to retire with his wife and Sophia, 
I 
hear he's bought a 
villa down in Gloucestershire, 
I 
shall die if I 
lose my Sophia. 
If any one had told me that a girl like Sophia. 
Would such love inspire, I'd have called him a 
her, 
Ill kill myself or else end my days as a 
friar, 
If I 
can't gain the love of Sophia. 
THE GlIEAT PATRIOTIC SONG 
Written and sung with success by Fred RobertS. 
America, 'tis of thy glories I 
sing, 
Let the cannon bilch forth, and joyous bells ring, 
May each patriot join in the strength of my voice, 
And each heart in its freedom and power rejoice. 
George Washington rescued the laud we adore, 
From the hand of the tyrant, brought peace to 
our shore, 
And its riches and beauty, its greatness and power, 
Outstrip all the world and are growing each hour. 
CHORUs. 
Our watchword is honor, our pride is our land. 
Our flag once unfurled, who its power can withstand, 
When freedom demands its protection and care, 
Our rifles are ready, insult it, " who dare." 
We care not for conquest, a 
world is our own, 
Which the splendors of Europe has never outshone, 
We ask but for peace, still we know how to fight, 
And bleed o'er again for our country and right, 
For the Stars and Stril'es, for the land of the free, 
Our soldiers and sailors, by land and on sea, 
Hand to hand in the contest would fight to the death. 
And cry Hail Columbia with their last breath.

Clarence McGraw. 
Composed by John T. Kelly, Sung by the great—the Inimita-
ble Mr. Fred Roberts. 
Though I 
am it married man I 
like a 
bit of fun. 
I 
often go to Coney Isle after my work is done, 
One pleasant day last summer an old friend says to me, 
" 
Let's take a 
skip down to the beach and have D. jolly 
spree." 
says he, " We'll have a 
jolly lark and stay out after dark—" 
My darling wife, j 
st coming in, had heard this last remark 
" 
Where are you going, dear, dressed in your best so gay ?" 
" 
I'm going to a 
funeral," then slyly she did say. 
Cuoitus. 
Clarence McGraw, Clarence McGraw, 
You're giving me taffy, you rasca', you know you are, 
Clarence McGraw, Clarence McGraw, 
You are at it again with your tra-la-la-la. 
Down on the Iron Pier I 
met a 
little dear, 
I 
treated her to dry champagne and German lager beer, 
I 
squeezed her little hand and said she was a 
dove, 
I 
vowed I 
was it bachelor and her I'd always love. 
If she was only willing to go bathing in the sea; 
She says, " I 
don't object, 'twould please me much I 
know," 
So then we joined the bathers and into the surf did go. 
SrOkell.—It WIIS all very well while we were in. 
While 
in the watery embrace of Neptune we sported and rolled 
about like two young porpoises. 
But a 
wave carried off her 
back hair and I 
told her I'd swim to Ireland after it. 
She 
says—

t'LABENCE IN,IcGRANT: 
ootinsIIED. 
We strolled along the beach and listened to the band, 
When Levy played his cornet we thought that it was grand, 
In courting by the sea the hours soon stole away, 
I 
placed my anti around her waist and there she let it stay. 
Then from the little miss I 
tried to steal a 
kiss, 
Site said that it was naughty, but I 
did not care for this, 
I 
whispered vows of love, just then I 
raised my head, 
And then I 
saw my angry wife and this is what she said 
Spoken.— Well, I 
was so astonished that I 
hardly know 
what I 
did say. 
I introduced the girl to my wife as my 
niece, Miss Pinchpot. 
Then Maud says, " Is that your 
wife?" 
My wife, who is one of those three hundred pound

Dear Little Innocent Things. 
Sung by the Gri-at E glish swell Singer and Art istic Comlque 
Fred T. Roberts, at the Academy of Music, Chicago, 
with great sticre,.8 
Woman, lovely woman, 
Was sent to us for this, 
To cheer our life, to be a 
wife, 
To fondle and to kiss. 
For some of them are beautiful, 
And oft our hearts entrance; 
And others are a 
different kind, 
So you ii,ust take the chance. • 
Spoken.—Early in life I 
adored the sex, and I 
used to 
say— 
CHORUS.' 
Oh ! they're dear little innocent things, they are, 
They're angels without any wings, they are, 
My love is so hot, I 
could kiss the whole lot 
Of the dear little innocent things—What things? 
The wedding ove*r, we enjoy 
The glorious honeymoon, 
In blissful skies the clouds arise, 
We weary of it soon. 
For ills begin, and bills come in— 
A thousand dollars clear, 
Your wife will sa2,-, ‘• Do kiss me pray 
You know I 
am so dear." 
, 
say— 
DEAR LITTLE INNOCENT THINGS. 
CONTTNLJED. 
Spoken.—Dear! Well I 
should say they are dear. But 
they're a 
sort of necessary evil, and it's best to smile and 
Oh ! the dear little, etc. 
Yo 11 often wonde how it is 
I 
know so much, though young; 
We'll you see my wife's a 
woman, 
And she's got her share of tongue. 
Before she wed she looled as though 
She could not hurt a 
fly, 
But the other day I 
saw a 
sight 
That nearly made me sigh. 
Spoken.—I 
got home from business an hour or two 
earlier than usual. 
I tried to get in the parlor, but the 
door was locked. 
I 
knocked, and after pounding about five 
minutes I 
was let in. 
I 
thought that I 
saw something that 
looked like a 
coat-tail dissapper at the back parlor. I 
asked, 
Who was here ?" 
She said a 
lady friend, 
I 
went over to 
the mantle piece and picked up a 
lighted cigar. 
Says I, 
" 
Do your lady friends smoke?" She then began to cry, 
and now I 
say— 
Cnonns, 
"What dear little innocent things they are, 
They're devils without any horns they are, 
If I 
was hung on the spot I 
could shoot the whole lot 
Of the dear little innocent things—Wbat things?

Now did you? No, I

At least I

And then, perhaps on the other baud. 
You might have done-- but 
You seldom see or hardly find, 
A 
loan

Advance and sing a 
comic song 
But they would all say this: 
Did you ever— ever • -- ever ? 
What ! 
ever—never-- never ? 
No ! well, hardly ever— ever— ever ! 
Well I 
really Mil surprised. 
Did you ever take a 
friend with you 
On wash- day home to dine, 
And introduce bin. to your wife--
Of course for the first time ? 
'Your wife she emiles 
you know the smile— 
Quite far from all that's neat, 
And then she whispers in .vour ear, 
"

Your friend, pernaps. may be a 
Jew, 
And pork woul

But still he says " It's very nice," 
To Mrs. G. your dear good wife. 
He says that he is fond of it, 
Then your child he does embrace; 
She streaks him with molasses 
All over his poor face. 
'Jr did you ever quarrel 
With your wife's dear mania. 
And hear the tales she tells of you— 
The horrid brute you are. 
She says be ore you inairied her,

And you had ot got a

A 
Quiet Little Home. 
Originally sung at Harrigan & Hart's Theatre Comique Broadway 
by EDWIN BARRY. 
I 
lead a 
very homely life in a 
quiet sort of way, 
1 
like well to enjoy, and not feel over gay; 
Fast life does not agree with me at any time or place, 
I've traveled nearly through this world at quite a 
quiet pacf 
CHORUS. 
A 
quiet little home in a 
quiet little way, 
A 
quiet little wife sitting quiet all the day, 
A 
quiet little parlor, a 
quiet cup of tea, 
A 
life of peace and quietness. that's the life for me. 
like to have my social sing, I 
like my pipe and glass, 
/ 
love my wife, I 
love my friends with whom the time to pass 
A 
reasonable hour to rest, an early hour to rise, 
'1 will make a 
man both healthy, wealthy, prosperous and wise. 
A 
quiet little home, &c. 
So now, my friends, take my advice, and do the best you gal 
To earn a 
name that will become an honest working man; 
Study the comforts of your home, and very soon you'll find 
life of peace and quietness is best suited to the mind. 
A 
quiet little home, &c. 
CUR AT MY HEELS.

As sung by AribmAms & SULLY to many smiles/ 
dislike to trust men who hang on to the truth, 
And haven't the nerve to tell lies; 
I 
like to hear a 
man say he killed fifty bears, 
When he knows in his heart they were flies. 
It may not be pleasant to have five thousand dollar? 
Given you by each tramp you meet, 
But it's better to find your mother-in-law drunk 
Than to judge a 
poor girl by her feet. 
CHORUS: 
For I 
do like a 
Tom cat with a 
high tenor voice, 
A Maria that can kick, fight and steal; 
like a 
spitz poodle with all kinds of fleas, 
But I 
don't like a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to see a 
chambermaid in a 
hotel 
Go through every new boarder's trunk, 
I 
like to see a 
preacher on Sunday in church, 
And on Monday in debt or on a 
drunk; 
I 
don't iike a 
maiden of sweet sixty-four 
To tell me she's just seventeen, 
But give me the girl from old Boston town 
Who can wrestle with baked pork and beans. 
CHORUS: 
For I 
do like boiled eggs that have seen better days, 
I 
can paralyze all kinds of veal; 
I 
can battle successfully with all kinds of soup. 
But I 
don't care to miss a 
square meal.

OH! FRED, TELL THEM TO STOP. 
Written and composed hy GEORGE ME. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY . IliS latest hit. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement, I'd take my girl there 
To pass a 
dull hour away; 
We went in you must know, and saw Baritum's show, 
Van Amburgh's menagerie, as well; 
There were round-about swings, and all kinds of thing-
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
DIALOGUE.— Yes! when we got in the fair, my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride in the swing. 
I 
said, all right, my 
darling; but directly the swing went a 
little too high, sne' 
lustily cried — 
CHORUS 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop, 
That was the cry of Maria; 
The more she said whoa, they said, let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit high; r. 
The people that stood round of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said, stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in boats beside us, 
Saying, master don't do such a 
thing; 
Then four or five ,roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knees; 
And one of them said, the young man's getting red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
DIALOGUE.—And Maria still cried out at the top of her 
voice— ( Chorus). 
They soon stopped the swing, Maria jumped out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her"some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
The girl I 
now do adore; 
Should you ever go there, to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing; 
Of the great round-about, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
DIALOGUE. — And when you take a 
girl with you, make 
her promise she won't call out— (Chorus).

MARY ANN, I'LL TELL YOUR MA. 
Written and Composed by GEOFFREY THORN. Sung with treat success

song is published by permission of E. H. 
HARDING,

:0:-
I 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half-pence, and a 
precious deal of love; 
She's living with her mother, as a 
maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to 
know; 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
Some heads pop round the corner and a 
vulgar voice will 
shout— 
CHORUS: 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your Ma, 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far; 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, fie! for shame, Tali! yah! yah! Oh! yah! 
We went last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the rail. 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail, 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not bear the sun; 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go, 
A 
head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
(Chorus). 
MARY ANN, I'LL TELL YOUR MA.—CoNTINtEo. 
We wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be, 
We thought from vulgar people there, we should at least 
be free; 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows 
could hear, 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so 
dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and 
kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
(Chorus). 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd 
roam; 
My Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must know her way about; 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
A. voice came down the staircase, and her little brother 
cried— 
SOREN.—Oh! oh! oh! 
(Chorus)

Why turn away when I

Why cold to-day? once I

Then thy heart stirred and flushed thy brow 
Never a 
word comes to me now— 
Now thy hand lies listless in mine ; 
Once its replies spake love divine; 
Cold as if we never hact met ; 
can it then be hearts can forget? 
CHORUS. 
Speak to me, speak— 
Be my heart heard, or it will break, 
For one kind word; 
No vows to bind, no pledge I 
seek 
Only be kind—speak to me, speak 
One idle day thou did'st deplore 
Some castaway, on desert shore- ; 
'Twas but a 
tale, by poet feigned, 
Yet thou did'st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan cad, sad to be 
Utterly lone, by the bleak sea; 
My life is drear, 1 
cast away— 
ciive me the tear moti shed'st that day

COMPLAINTS. 
Banjo solo as sung by BILLY RAY. 
THERE never can so strange a 
time as this to me appear, 
Once more be settled in my mind I 
never can, 
For everything that's taken place seems to me so very queer, 
Scarce I 
know if I'm myself at all or some other ancient 
man; 
All these affairs have caused so much anxiety, 
That I 
have suffered from a 
series of complaints. 
Numerous afflictions I 
have had a 
great variety, 
I'll tell you all about them, for my tongue knows no 
restraints. 
First, I've had the gout, the asthma, and lumbago, 
Diptheria, sciatica, and rheumatism too, 
Brownchitis, bluechitis, I've been a 
martyr to the ague, 
old-ralgia, hoop-de-doo-den-doo; 
I've also had the toothache, corns, warts, and bunions, 
Scarlatina, constantina. and tightness of the chest, 
Pains in the knee-joints, oh, such very funny ones, 
My suffering from the measles too, is hard to be expressed. 
I've had several more complaints that I've forgot to mention, 
But as you seem to smpathizc, why them I 
will relate, 
Catalespia, dogalespia, please to pay attention, 
St. VittE,'' dance and influenza in my ancient pate; 
I've also had the quinzy, chilblains, and whooping-cough, 
2pinal complaints and velocipede on the breast, 
Knock-knees, bow-legs, gumboils, emcnsicoff, 
lowdrophobia., you know how it Is yourself. 
Some Girls Do and Some Girls Don't. 
Of all the strangest girls on earth, 
I 
think my girl's the one ; 
You know she has peculiar ways, 
And quite devoid of fun. 
She never sees a 
joke of mine, 
Whenever humor flows, 
But gives me a 
disdainful look 
And quite turns up her nose. 
SPoKEN—Some girls like a 
little joke, you know, but min,. 
don't, she turns her nose up at it. 
I 
think she works it eiri 
tfAe same principle as this (turning up nose withjinger). 
CHORUS. 
Some girls do, and some girls don't, 
Soma  
girls will, but my girl won't ; 
tri,..1 ye./ 1 ,-(1 
to see if she would, 
She said she really couldn't, and I 
don't think she coF 
I 
to:Jk my love to see the 'play, 
As other fellahs dc ; 
And thought that she'd enjoy herself, 
She cried the whole night th:cugh. 
And when we reached the streeL 
Some oysters I 
propo.,ed, 
But she said, " No, not me, young man," 
Still turning up her nose. 
SPOKEN—Up 
it went again at three dozen of fht,bes 
Saddle Rocks, just think of that. 
To see a 
girl turn up hei 
nose at five cents a 
time. 
I 
said, " Well, my love, if yo• 
El 5 
won't have any supper, we will have a 
cab and go home." 
She replied, " No, young man, no four-wheeled cabs for me 
.Nt this time of night." 
Some girls do, &e. 
We met one Sunday afternoon, 
For a 
day in Central Park; 
And when we mounted " One tree hill" 
We had, well, say a 
lark ! 
Georgina said, " You know, young man, 
Some girls prefer a 
stroll ; 
Not me, when I'm in Central Park 
I 
dearly love a 
roll r 
SPOKEN—Now, there's an extraordinary girl for you. 
Ot 
course, I 
wanted to take her for a 
nice quiet lover's walk in 
some shady lane, but she said she'd prefer a 
roll. 
Then I 
wanted to talk to her of love, romance, and poetry, but no, 
she said she'd " sooner have a 
good dinner." 
Well, 
Some girls do, &c. 
Not long ago my uncle died 
And left me fifty pounds ; 
As soon as I 
received the news 
My joy it knew no bounds. 
I 
thought, well, I 
will marry now, 
So I 
at once proposed; 
But when I 
mentioned the amount 
Up went 
lovely nose. 
SPOKEN—The bad girl, she said she ought to have five 
hundred v.-iTh such a 
man 
me. 
I 
thought she would have 
;Limped at me, you know, for, 
Some girls do„,

THE OLD VILLAGE SCHOOL ON THE 
GREEN, 
Written by FRANK VAN HESS for ED. BURTON, and sung by him 
with great success. 
Oh! I 
love the bright days of my youth to review, 
And fancy again I'm a 
boy, 
With my merry companions so faithful and true, 
And friendship that knows no ahoy, 
Oh ! the thoughts I 
review as I 
ponder the past, 
Itecading each dear youthful scene ; 
The one I 
most prize, and will love to the last, 
Is the c,ld village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Near the old village school the cottage still stands, 
Where I 
first saw the dawn of light ; 
And now over its porch in rich clustering bands, 
The roses are blooming as bright 
As ' twas when with garlands and wreaths of wild flowers, 
We joyously crowned our May Queen, 
And told childish love tales in neat little bowers, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
I 
have left many dear and some loved ones behind 
To rest as I've journeyed along; 
There are others remain just as faithful and kind, 
To join in the laugh and the song; 
And when I 
am caded by grim death to prepare, 
I 
will answer with spirit serene, 
J.Uhey'hlla1 me to rest when I 
breathe my last prayer, 
tear the old village school on the green.

You'll Never Run the - Engine Unless 
You have the Steam. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, with :great success, throughout the 
States. 
There's many maxims in this world, 
And practice makes them true; 
But the one that I've invented, 
You'll find it good and new •, 
Man may be likened to a 
boat, 
Afloat on life's great stream, 
But he'll never run the engine 
Unless he has the steam. 
CHORUS. 
Then keep the fires a 
burning, boys, 
You'll find the wheel will turn, 
You'll seldom meet with accidents 
If the motive power you learn. 
Upon life's steam gauge keep an eye, 
Don't fall asleep and dream, 
For you'll never run the engine 
Unless you keep up steam. 
Look at the home where rich sunshine 
Makes every thing so bright, 
Then gaze upon that poor man's hut, 
'Where all is dark- 2-t night, 
DLI'LL NEVER RUN THE LN.,'INE UNLESS YOU 
HAVE THE STEAM. 
Continued. 
His wife lies dying on the straw, 
For bread his children scream, 
'Tis hard to run life's engine far, 
If he hasn't got much steam. 
Then keep the fires, &c. 
Columbus many years ago, 
Did ask the Queen of Spain, 
To fit him out with men and ships, 
To sail the unknown main; 
Some instinct told him there was land 
That never had been seen; 
Now we run America, for 
Columbus gave us steam. 
Then keep the fires, &c. 
Then haughty England made a 
yoke, 
And brought it to this land, 
But soon found out ' twould never fit 
That brave and fearless band. 
For the engine was commanded 
By Washington and Greene, 
And we owe our independence to 
Their patriotic steam.

Only the Way on the Stage. 
Comp'used by FRLD. J. MACKLEY and sung by HENRY GRAHAM. 
If you will listen to me, some facts I 
will mention, 
Concerning the past and the present strange age, 
ad in them, my friends, to you I'll relate 
Some things I 
saw one night and played on the stage: 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And went for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
le/hen we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new drama was played on the stage. 
'I he first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
.There a 
poor woman begging, she quite old in age, 
hose sad means she tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson of life's book a 
page ; 
Tint a 
policeman -passed by, his face seemed all smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages, 
b
end he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
'file scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
e'd murdered a 
man, by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed. 
The jury looked stern, and the judge in a 
rage, 
And they hung that,rich man for the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
In the next scene I 
saw a 
clergyman _ rom Brooklyn, 
Who was dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one from Jersey was playing the violin, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed ; 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine sermon on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that they practiced each sermon they preached, 
But it wa5 only the way it wtes .played on the stage. 
NORAH IS DREAMING OF YOU! 
41s Sung la; ALICE M URRAY, in their Sketch Terry's Return, 
Sweetly, the stars up above us are dnaming„ 
The birds they are dreamikr4 of morn ; 
Sad is the moon, though in radiance beaming, 
She is dreaming, alone and forlorn ; 
Roses and lilies, so gentle and loving, 
\.re dreaming, I 
know, in the dew ; 
So, when afar you are thoughtlessly roving, 
Your Norah is dreaming of you. 
Still I 
am waiting, so sadly and 
0, tell me, if still you are true? 
Dream of me, darling, for one moment, 
While Norah, your N , nib, is dreaming of you. 
Tho' you forget me, when far you are miming, 
I 
shall not believe it, my own ; 
Don't you remember you said in the gloaming, 
That I 
was your darling, alone ? 
Come to my heart, like a 
bird that is weary, 
0 
conic to your Norala so true ; 
Linger not long, for the days they are dreary, 
While Norah is dreaming of you. 
Still I 
am waiting. so sadly and lonely, 
0, tell me, if still you are true ; 
Dream of me, derliner, 
or one moment only, 
For Norah, your Norah. is dreaming of you..

Sweet maiden, that tore us apart;

Cruel the parents that caused us to part, 
Sweet Eileen, because I

But richer than gold was the love of my heart; 
And brighter than jewels, asthore; 
Do not forget me, my darling Eileen, 
In that far off land of the free; 
Faithful and true to your memory I've been, 
Oh come back sweet Eileen to me.

OLD SAVANNAH HOME. 
Written and sung by the HAYLES, WILL and LOX. 
Where the balmy air was blowing and the roses catch the 
dew, 
The mocking bird was singing in the trees; 
There's a 
lovely little city and I 
will ever hold it true, 
I 
was born among the butterflies and bees. 
Through them pastures and them fields I 
lived the whole 
day 13ng., 
From them I've been obliged to roam; [song, 
When I 
think of merry times and the good old dance and 
I 
long to see my old Savannah home. 
Cuonts: 
I 
long to see you once again and feel your scented breeze, 
Through your sunny streets I 
long to roam; 
I 
long to hear the mocking birds a 
singing in the trees, 
That bloom around my old Savannah home. 
Where the sweet magnolia blossoms that am blooming in 
the lane, 
.Those gardens that am laden with perfume; 
All am dearer to this darlie,y than the long and level plain, 
For there we had room enough to roam. [skies, 
The shining moon at night that came peeping through the 
Our flatboats along the beautiful river shore; 
And down the rippling water where Fort Pulaski lies, 
Our merry dancing party soon was o'er. (Chorus). . 
'them good old days am past and gone, the boys they have 
gone too, 
The pretty girls are scattered o'er the land; [say, 
And times ain't like they used to was when massa had his 
And each plantation had its darkey band. 
There's a 
handsome little spot, the place where I 
was born,

lovely little cot 1

'Twas there they laid my mother down one quiet, pleasant 
morn, 
The songsters sang then: sad and plaintive glee

Why did we ever roam from our dear old Irish home, 
The dear old home that was so bright and gay; 
And the friends we left behind to us were good and kind, 
When we left old Ireland for America. 
They kindly cheered us on that bright summer's morn, 
As we parted from our loved ones at the shore; 
We are never free from care for our hearts are ever there, 
In our pretty mountain home in dear old Erin. 
CHORUS. 
Our hearts are never glad, for our thoughts do make us 
sad, 
And it's for our sweet-hearts now that we are caring; 
We do regret the day that we went so far away, 
From our sunny mountain home in dear oid Erin. 
We have traveled through this land, and saw places that 
were grand, 
But there's sights to see in Ireland all the same; 
These dear familiar scenes, we can see them in our dream:-
Around that dear old home from where we came. 
Where the lads are gay and witty, and the girls so sweet 
and pretty, 
The day that we shall see them it is nearing; 
But we do regret the day that we went so far away, 
From our pretty mountain home in dear old Erin, 
(Chorus). 
Paddle Your Boat Along. 
Sung with great success by EnwIN BARRY. 
This world we live in is just like the sea, 
Travelers over its waters are we ; 
Try to be happy where'er you may be, 
If the wind should blow steady and strong. 
It's no use to grumble, to growl or complain, 
You can't stop the wind nor you can't stop the rain, 
After a 
storm we have sunshine again— 
So paddle your boat along. 
CHORUS. 
Always try to be happy and gay. 
Let this world jog on as it may; 
Always do right and never do wrong, 
As you paddle your boat along. 
There are people we meet who always seem glad, 
Others who always seem solemn and sad. 
They want all the good but won't share the bad; 
Now I 
think that decidedly wrong. 
There are good things enough in this world for us all, 
If we be content with a 
share of the small, 
Tho' little our lot, some have nothing at all, 
So paddle your own boat along. 
Always try to be happy, &c. 
Don't be down-hearted, though breakers may roar, 
Or if your boat be cast on the shore; 
You are sure to get into smooth water once more 
If you pull steady and strong. 
Don't pull too slow nor yet pull too fast, 
But always make way for a 
friend to get past. 
The harbor of safety you'll reach well at last, 
If you paddle your boat along. 
Always try to be happy, &c.

Far away in the South, among the cotton

ever long to see, 
Oh! the dear sunny clime where I 
was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me;

In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home.

When I

And my heart grows so sad I 
long to return, 
Oh 1

And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
'Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
Oh! I 
will go back again, back to them cotton fields, 
In that old cabin home there let me die. 
Then give me, etc. 
THE MINSTREL'S DREAM. 
An original song, as sung by PRASE: LEWIS with immense 
success. 
One eve while sitting in my chair before my fire so brignt, 
Its rays dispelled the midnight gloom, and lightened up the 
night, 
My thoughts reverted to the past, and brought before my gaze, 
The shadowed forms of minstrels great, the kings of by-gone 
days; 
I 
saw the people laugh and cry, as alternately they gave— 
The merry pun, the mirthful joke, the ballad sweet and grave, 
They formed a 
quaint procession, as they passed before my 
sight, 
The minstrels of our former days, thus conjured from the night. 
I 
saw George Christy shako the bones, sweet mnsic from them 
drag, 
And how the audience it would roar, as he told each merry gag, 
Saw - Daddy " Rice in ecstacy, those legs of his to throw 
The father of the minstrels—he who danced the first " Jim 
Crow 
Heard Mulligan, with towering form, pathetic ballads sing, 
When Long John opened once his mouth, 'twas down the house 
he'd bring, 
Stevie Rogers gave his excelsior clog, the greatest ever seen, 
And. other well-known faces came to fill my minstrel's dream. 
Nel
,
:; Seymour showed his giant form, and passed me by and 
miled, 
A. friend to every one in need the minstrel's favorite child, 
42 
How oft I've heard his merry laugh, as he made the night pass 
o'er, 
Give out the joke which ever set the audience in a 
roar , 
He scarcely disappeared when came the minstrel king and 
man, 
The glory of the boys in black—the merrplaughing Dan, 
As Bryant passed me by, his face with radiance seemed to 
beam, 
Se cast a 
brilliant halo upon my minstrel's dream. 
Young Jerry, of the 13ryants, too, with bones and tamborine, 
Recounted every great success in minstrelsy he'd seen, 
Billy Manning, of Chicago fame, then passed me swiftly by, 
And Unsworth gave his great stump speech, in which he the 
world defied; 
Jimmy Bradley danced his unequalled jig, familiar to us all, 
Billy Pastor sang his comic songs, and was many times recalled, 
Eph Horn, the last bright face I 
saw, he threw a 
radiant gleam 
Upon the spirits who had gone to fill my minstrel's dream.

Don't laugh or giggle for shame ; 
Don't notice such men, but pass on your way, 
If you don't you will be much to blame. 
CHORUS. 
For a 
man will invariably pass a 
remark 
On a

Now just move along, no encouragement give, 
Then about you they never can talk. 
Go into a 
ball room, be happy and gay 
With a 
handsome young man by your side, 
There he tells you he loves you, and at some future day 
He would be happy to make you his bride. 
But if he should pinch you or hug you a 
bit, 
Give him to understand there and then, 
And just tell him plainly he had better behave, 
As you never encourage such men. 
For a 
man will, & c. 
Now if you have a 
sweetheart, and by chance he gets broke, 
lie will not hesitate to tell you, 
Then he will say to you, " Darling, 
Will you be so good as to lend me a 
dollar or two ?" 
If von lend him a

If to-morrow he will not want ten.

THE SPORTING MAN, 
Written by HARRY Basic= expressly for JAMES O'NEIL, of O'NEIL

I'm something of a 
sporting man, I 
often make a 
bet, 
1 
stand a 
chance of loosing, but I 
have not done it yet; 
I'm something of a 
wrestler, I 
often take it in, 
But when I 
take a 
thoroughbred, my chances are but slim 
A 
little bit of pleasantry oecui red the other night, 
1 
went to see a 
wrestling match which ended in a 
fight; 
A 
Dutchman, a 
Scotehman, a 
Frenchman and a 
Mick, 
And poor Johnny Reilly got plugged with a 
brick. 
eitortus: 
Nobody knows what trouble was there, 
Nobody knows I 
do declare; 
Nobody knows what fun I 
did see; 
Nobody knows indeed but me. 
Now the cause of all the trouble I 
couldn't keep it mum, 
Some one called Jerry McIntyre a 
bum; 
Jerry jumped up, struck out with his hand, 
And swore he could whip any cripple in the land; 
Big John :\ ronahan standing in the dock, 
He caught hold of :McIntyre, and threw him on the floor; 
He went for little Brady, and hit him such a 
whack, 
That he busted his undershirt plum off of his back. 
Oh when Brady he got up, he was a 
terrible looking sight, 
He looked as if he slept with the pigs all night; 
lie looked at his undershirt and then he dropped a 
tear, 
And then he flew for Monahan and chewed off his ear; 
Ile made one brace and landed at the bar, 
lie called for a 
hummer, and they gave him a 
cigar; 
He took a 
match to light it, and what do you suppose, 
It was chock full of powder, and it blew off his nose. 
Then they fought in the hallway, they fought in a 
room, 
And the things they used for boxing gloves was the bat 
room spittoons; 
They couldn't see each other they welted so hard, 
They set fire to the house and fought out in the yard. 
The police all came down in big platoons, 
And quick gathered up every fighting gossoon; 
Six months on the Island sine they all have to stay, 
For setting fire to the house on St. Patrick's Day,

SOMETHING TO TICKLE THE GIRLS. 
Written by A. W. FRENCH. 
Sang by EDWIN Baum: at the Theatre Comique. 
Music by T. B. KELLEY. 
The pet of the girls ev'ry where, 
Society calls ine a 
wit; 
For nothing gets on unless there, 
I 
drop in to please them a 
bit; 
I've stories not few, and jokes that are new, 
As brilliant they tell me as pearls; 
Nonsense now and then is liked by all men, 
Of course it will tickle the girls. 
Someth_ng to tickle the girls, 
Laughing and shaking their curls; 
You'll not go amiss, I 
promise you this, 
With something to tickle the girls. 
Some chaps they are terrible bores, 
Some spoony and dull as a 
hoe; 
No kind that a 
gay girl adores, 
She favors no one who is slow; 
I
siome fellows are shy, and others they try, 
To please when as crabbid as churls; 
I'm not either one, I 
can revel in fun, 
And can always tickle the girls. 
(Chorus) 
Then take my advice ev'ry one, 
And put it at once to the test; 
Go in with the girls and have fun, 
For that is just what suits them best; 
They like a 
gay heart, who does well his part, 
To cheer them as life swiftly whirls; 
You're always their friend, to love and commend 
With something to tickle the girls. 
(Chorus).

I 
love my love in de morning, 
I 
love my love at night, 
I 
love my love the whole day long, 
For she's my beauty bright. 
(
Repeat.) 
First when I

Business seemed to hop; 
My wife she took in whitewashing, 
And I

Oh, when I's ten years married, 
How happy I

We'll all gef Tory as the Niglit Wears oZ9 
I 
don't like a 
fellow who's stingy and close, 
And can't bear to part with a 
crown, 
Nor yet do I 
like him who's stern and morose, 
And looks on the world with a 
frown ; 
But give me the fellow whoe'er he may be, 
Who cares not for peasant or king, 
Who likes a 
good spree, that's the fellow for me, 
And with him I'll merrily sing— 
CHORUS. 
Drink, boys, drink, and let your glasses jingle, 
Drink, boys, drink, and bid dull care be gone, 
Shout, boys, shoul, and let your voices mingle, 
We'll all get jolly as the night wears on. 
'Tis fine of an evening when business is done, 
And the toils of the day have gone past, 
To sit in the parlor of some cosy pub. 
And drown all your cares in a 
glass; 
Let squeamish teetot'lers drInk coffee and tea, 
And prate of the coppers they save, 
I 
laugh at their cant, and tho' they may rant, 
I'll sing till I'm laid in my grave— 
Drink, boys, drink, &a. 
Of friends I've a 
few, such a 
rollicking crew, 
And trouble assails us in vain, 
We meet every night and often get tight, 
On brandy or glorious champagne ; 
For frolic and noise faith we are the boys, 
And then as the hours speed along, 
We call in the host, who gives us a 
toast, 
Or sings us this right jovial song— 
Drink, boys, drink, &C. 
To fall deep in love with a 
sweet turtle dove, 
Very fine for some fellows may be, 
But the exquisite bliss of a 
woman's sweet kiss, 
Has no great attraction for me ; 
At young Cupid's shrine to kneel I 
decline, 
To Bacchus I'll stick hard and fast, 
With a 
dollar to spend and another to lend, 
And gaily I'll sing to the last— 
Drink, boys, drink, &c.

We sat b: the river, you and I ! 
In the sweet summer time long ago. 
So smoothly the water glided by, 
Making music in its tranquil flow; 
We threw two leaflets, you and I, 
To the river, as it wander'd on, 
And one was rent and left to die, 
And the other floated forward all alone, 
And oh ! we were sadden'd, you and I! 
For we felt that our youth's golden dream 
Might fade, and our lives be sever'd soon, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream ! 
'Tis years since we parted, you and I! 
In that sweet summer time, long ago. 
And I 
smile as I 
pass the river by, 
And I 
gaze into the shadow depths below. 
I 
look on the grass and bending reeds, 
And I 
listen to the soothing song, 
And I 
envy the calm and happy life 
Of the river, as it sings and flows along, 
For oh! how its song brings back to me 
The shade of our youth's golden dream! 
In the days ere we parted, you and I,

."Inicrican Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widley known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q, for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing- is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under • 
standing. 
Many professional Furtune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
uclosed in handsome case 
Price 25 Cents. 
Courting' Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
t. meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too difd-
dentu.too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
quation. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence', which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fisumt's, No. 21

mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would 
only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunatly, there Is 
enough of it 
one without any further necessity of explaining "how, 
when and where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called `flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book, bound in Morrocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt." published by A. J. FisitEn, No. 24 Vesey Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan glove and parasol. 
As there 
.s nothing at all objectionable in the vOlume, and its contents might 
afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
