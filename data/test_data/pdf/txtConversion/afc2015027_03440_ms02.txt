DOMESTIC WORKERS UNITED 
Interview afc2015027_03440_ms02 
Christine Lewis interviews Rosemaire Primo. 
 
 
Christine Lewis: 
Hi, my name is Christine Lewis and we're archiving the voices of domestic 
workers under the Archie Green Grant that was given to chronicle or archive the 
voices of the women in the Library of Congress. You can look at me, you don't 
have to look at the ... yeah. 
 
What is your name, or what name you'll be using for this interview? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
This interview, my name is Rosemarie and my African name [00:00:30] is Kalifa. 
Christine Lewis: 
Kalifa, wow.  
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
How you come about Kalifa? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
My grandparents, they come from Madagascar, my great-grandparents and 
they used to call me Cauliflower before but really they say Kalifa means a 
person that is stepping up after someone passes, taking over the realm and the 
reigns. That's how we come up with Kalifa, [00:01:00] which is a name I seldom 
used. It's like a private name. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see, what is your current occupation? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I am a home care aide. Previously I was a teacher for quite a number of years in 
my country. I love education and I think it's such a big stream to paddle in with 
education because it opens so many doors [00:01:30] and I just love to be in 
there. Even now, I can combine both my educative skills with my skills looking 
after ill people. 
Christine Lewis: 
We'll come to that. I like the fact that you talk about skills. We have so much to 
talk about. You said your country, where are you from originally? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I am from Trinidad and Tobago but I grew up in a district called Curepe, Santa 
Margarita, [00:02:00] which in the early years in Curepe was more Spanish-
oriented. Then it diverse change where the populous now became Indians and 
the Negroes, but we all live as one. All live as one. 
Christine Lewis: 
What borough do you live in, or neighborhood that you live in right now? You're 
living in the States right, so what borough? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I live in Brooklyn, New York. [00:02:30] It has been a good neighborhood to me 
for the number of years. I have seen the changes over the years where now it

has become where people want to live. It's becoming difficult to get apartments 
in this area because of the changes, because of the various stores and the 
accessibility to what you need. It has [00:03:00] changed in its dynamics totally. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. How did you become a domestic worker? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
From- 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me stop you, because the genre of work that we do and we do it in the 
home is domestic work. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Domestic work, yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Some people have a really hard time, again, we talk from whence we come but 
we're here now. Any work that is done in the home, the Hispanic women would 
say, [00:03:30] they don't like the word domestic. When we convene in 
Washington, D.C. they would say they don't like the word domestic because 
domestic indicates to them, dogs and cats, chickens, domesticated. For us now, 
we came up with Domestic Workers United, is work done in the home. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
In the home yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
How did you become a domestic worker? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
First let me clear this point. We have to now, in this society, remove the stigma 
of being in the [00:04:00] cage, "domesticated". We have to look at it as a great 
input into society and is bringing in money to pay bills.  
Christine Lewis: 
Suffice it to be so, it's true. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
We have to remove that stigma that the "domesticated" does not conform to 
society's likeness. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. When you say- 
Rosemarie Primo: 
When I came into this country, [00:04:30] I came and taught in the daycare. It 
was some excellent years. I still meet with my students who have gone on to do 
very well and after that, I got into ... When the daycare folded up because of 
other day cares coming in and I was introduced to the healthcare system. I 
[00:05:00] got into that and my love for children and for babies, I got into the 
healthcare system. I had my state board, I graduated, so I found it to be a very 
challenging area, but very rewarding. 
Christine Lewis: 
You say child care, what areas ... Apart from child care, you do any other ... As 
[00:05:30] you talk about health, and that can be vague, what other areas are 
you in? That could lead us to the next question. How many positions have you 
had? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Rosemarie Primo: 
Numerous. 
Christine Lewis: 
We'll get into that because- 
Rosemarie Primo: 
In my country, I was a cook, a teacher, a student advisor counsellor. Then I 
became a part, very active in my church, so I was [00:06:00] a Sunday school 
teacher and when I came up here I continued into teaching, into healthcare, 
into church work. I assisted my community as much as I can, so I wear a number 
of hats. As it comes along, I wear a number of hats. Nothing is too big for me to 
undergo once I have to time and once I am given the opportunity [00:06:30] to 
do it, I take up the challenge and do it. 
Christine Lewis: 
How long have you been doing the work? As you talk about the health sector. 
Break it down. Break it down as to ... or compartmentalize it. The health system 
is, as you talk about kids. Who again you work with and how long altogether? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I worked with ... Most of my healthcare now, the daycare was mostly with the 
kids, from babies [00:07:00] to kindergarten through those years, formative 
years. After I left that, I went into the healthcare system with adults. I took care 
of elderly people, basically, elderly people. People that has all sorts of illnesses 
and try to encourage them in their illnesses and to support them because a lot 
of them too, they don't [00:07:30] have the family support and you, the 
healthcare provider, becomes like that daughter, becomes like that mother, for 
these sick people. The healthcare is good for me. 
Christine Lewis: 
Have you also morphed into childcare as well, a nanny now ... Does- 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Now, I am just basically into the healthcare. 
Christine Lewis: 
How long have you been doing it for? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
The healthcare, [00:08:00] I've been doing this like, let me see, about 11, 12 
years. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes, about 11 or 12 years, 
Christine Lewis: 
Please walk me through a typical daily routine. What are your day-to-day 
responsibility with your elderly folks that you work with? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
My daily responsibilities, first of all, I pray before I get there. 
Christine Lewis: 
Why? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
You need [00:08:30] that spirituality because when you look at these elderly and 
what they are going through, you can be lost with them, mentally and 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

physically. You have to pray and ask God guidance that when you leave your 
home and arrive to their place, or where they are, you would be able to sustain 
yourself and give of your best to [00:09:00] them. Sometimes you leave them 
one way and by the time you get back to the next, it's a different person. They 
may become ill during the course of the night, they have to go into the hospital. 
They become in pain and you have to know how to shift. You're always shifting 
the lanes with them.  
 
My protégé is I pray first and [00:09:30] when I get there, I check the 
environment. I check them to see that they're okay. I question them and then I 
offer them to see if they have their breakfast done, if they remember to do 
what they have to do, if they are allowed to do certain things for themselves. 
We just communicate and play, walk with them, keep them clean, keep them 
safe until you are ready to leave document and [00:10:00] what you're ready to 
leave. If something is extraordinary or unusual, I would call in the coordinator or 
the case manager and let them know that I find this unusual and if they can 
send someone to investigate it. Usually, my day is quite active. 
Christine Lewis: 
When you say question them, what does that question entails? What would you 
question them about? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I would question them, "How was your night? Where did you go?" because 
sometimes they leave them [00:10:30] with other relatives. The objective of 
doing that is to find out if they are being treated nicely, because sometimes 
they can be abused and you don't know it. Abuse is not something you always 
see physically, it could be on the inside so when I go in there I say, "How was 
your night? Did you go to a family function? Did you enjoy ..." If they have a 
wedding to go to, "Did you go to the wedding? [00:11:00] Did you do this, did 
you do that?" I get them to talk. The objective is to get them to discuss and to 
talk so you know when something is not in line, you, the caregiver, can pick it up 
right away. 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. What skills do you need to be a domestic worker? What skills do you have 
to have? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
You have to have a good communicative skills, number one. [00:11:30] You have 
to have patience, because not all ways is going to be the way you want it and 
you must be able to pick up the challenge without questioning. It's there and it 
has to be done. You just put yourself in place and get it done. 
 
Some people want to choose, in healthcare, the type of patients they want to 
[00:12:00] look at and you can't be so ... What's the word ... you can't be so 
choosing, because healthcare incorporates a lot of things. Some people don't 
want to work with Alzheimer's, they don't want to work with this, but you can't 
have it smooth all the time. I don't pick and choose what I want. I just give a 
patient, [00:12:30] I get the outline and I go towards and just do what I have to 
do.

Christine Lewis: 
Is there a training that is necessary to be a successful domestic worker? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Sure there is. In order to be successful, you have to go through training on a 
global scale, and training within yourself, because sometimes you have to make 
changes [00:13:00] for yourself so that you will have a balance. You would have 
to know, "How much I can put out with this particular work field." To be 
domesticated, it takes a lot, especially if you are running a home away from 
home like I have here now. 
Christine Lewis: 
What does that do? What is that home away from home? Let me touch that. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Home away from home could be sad. [00:13:30] It can be a sad place. It can be a 
dark spot, in the sense that you are ... you feel I am here alone, "My husband is 
not with me but yet still, I have to take up the challenges and move on."  
Christine Lewis: 
Why he is not with you? You don't have to answer. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
My husband is not home. He has chronic illnesses that does not permit 
[00:14:00] him to be home. He is housed in a facility so I am here alone and I am 
taking care of my job running this home and also taking care of him at the 
facility. 
Christine Lewis: 
And running that home. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
And running that home. It can be a dark spot but you have to have balance. How 
do I get balance? I pray and meditate, I do a lot of things outside, [00:14:30] I 
meet people, I laugh and I talk. When I come in here, this is my sanctuary. I have 
to keep it clean, I have to keep it in line because is you come in, you leave 
conflicts and stuff at home and when you come home, you don't want to do 
that now. This is your- 
Christine Lewis: 
You mean conflict at work. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
At work, right. 
Christine Lewis: 
This is your sanctuary. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
When I come here, this is my sanctuary. [00:15:00] This is my peace. This is 
where the walls speak to me and say, "Hello, I miss you." There's no voice to say 
it but my house speaks to me. When I enter, it is safe and it is comfortable and it 
is clean. 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. Is there some specialty or expertise that you have, and I think you did say 
it. [00:15:30] You align so many, you're a teacher, you did it say it in the 
beginning, which was good. You talk about where you come from, teacher, 
[inaudible 00:15:39] remind me again. What is that specialty? That thing in your 
multitude of special things that you do. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Rosemarie Primo: 
My specialty is the children because I believe that when you have the child, and 
you mold that child [00:16:00] and you put out your expertise to that child and 
you watch that child grow, grow into a good individual, nothing can [inaudible 
00:16:20]. That's my specialty. It gives me a great pleasure [00:16:30] when the 
children comes and say "Hi" ... They call me Aunty Rosemarie, and I look, "Who 
are you?" "I'm so and so from daycare. I'm so and so from kindergarten." I have 
a student live in my building now. I cannot open the door- 
Christine Lewis: 
You mean this building? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
This building, right across the hall ... He told the guys, no one is to interfere with 
me and when they see me coming in, they are [00:17:00] to get up and give me 
assistance, in the building. I have- 
Christine Lewis: 
You're the mayor.  
Rosemarie Primo: 
I'm the mayor, I don't know what [inaudible 00:17:08].  
Christine Lewis: 
That's good though.   
Rosemarie Primo: 
This is the kind of outcomes that ... It's a good feeling. You know what it is to 
plant a seed and wet it and put it in good soil and see it grow and bear fruits. 
Christine Lewis: 
Tell me, when caring for the elders in [00:17:30] your field of domestic work, 
your field is the elderlies, what are some of the tactics that you have for them to 
fall asleep or to do things that they normally ... Because you have all types of 
patients that you deal with, especially with sleeping and habits, food. Sleeping, 
food, what tricks you use? What is that thing that drives you to work with them, 
especially when they stubborn? I know because my aunt has Alzheimer's and 
she really is not the easiest person. I dread [00:18:00] for my mother on the 
island, I really dread. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
First of all, I observe and try to depict what she wants or what he wants. What is 
he telling me, because some of them don't verbalize, by speech. They verbalize 
through their eyes and through their body motion so you have to ... I have to 
pick up what it is you expressing. What is that [00:18:30] feeling inside that you 
cannot speak.  
 
Once I can determine that, then I would said, "You like this?" I would take the 
person to the place that I perceive that that's where she wants to go or what 
she wants to eat and then we will take it from there. If I see that she's still being 
... not cooperating, I just leave her for a little while. I step [00:19:00] out the 
room but she's still in my sight. Rather than pulling wounds or power-struggling 
with her and it's not going to solve the problem, I just exit myself away from 
her, but I can still see her and just let that bad motion passes then we can come 
back to [inaudible 00:19:23].

Sometimes it can be a medication that they took. It can be a new medication 
[00:19:30] that they eat. It can be an onset of something else happening in the 
body and you don't know. Rather than struggling with her to eat and to ... We 
just leave it- 
Christine Lewis: 
Allow it. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
... allow it to flow its course and most time you find that they are sleepy because 
they have disruptive sleep because of incontinence, mostly and they have to get 
up so often [00:20:00] in the night and stuff, so their sleep is not a straight 
sleep. At times, they sleep so much in the day, then the night times is shorter so 
you got to know the client and how they work and how they operate and then 
you just fall into it, but I never, never power struggled with them. I never forced 
them to do anything. If they don't want to [00:20:30] eat, I would tell them, 
remind them, that I'm not here all the time and, "I'm interested in you eating 
because your diet is important and it helps you from going into hospital." Some 
of them would say, "No hospital, no hospital. No hospital, don't say that word," 
those who can speak, "No hospital, no hospital Rosie," they call me Rosie, 
"Don't speak that word." 
 
I have one [00:21:00] here, my patient, because right now I am jostling two 
patients. I work Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with one and if you 
want to see her, tell her about a hospital, "No, no, no, no Rosie. No hospital." 
She can be sick, ailing, no hospital. I had her on bed and I worked [00:21:30] at 
her ambulation exercises and now she's on to the rollator and the wheelchair 
and she's doing pretty okay. 
Christine Lewis: 
She doesn't have Alzheimer? We talk about Alzheimer but she doesn't have 
Alzheimer? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
She doesn't have. It's not an Alzheimer, it's just that she goes in now to ... Plus 
she's 91 ... in a forgetful state so you have to be ... I am not the doctor. We are 
not doctors [00:22:00] to diagnose but we still have to record and pay attention 
to see where it is going but she has a lot of her faculties still on. Trust me, trust 
me. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see. Is there any kind of food that she likes? That you prepare and she really 
likes? 
Chris Mule: 
I just need to move your mic really quick. I'm sorry, I just need to  [inaudible 
00:22:24]. 
Christine Lewis: 
You want to put it here? 
Chris Mule: 
Yeah. Do you mind? 
Domestic Workers United

That was a great answer. That was [00:22:30] really interesting. I think many 
things she said but the hospital, one of the things that we've been ... That's a 
tactic that you use, bringing up the hospital and things like that. Unfortunately 
it's ... They don't like to go to the hospital. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
They don't like to go in the hospital. 
Chris Mule: 
Anyway, I'm sorry [crosstalk 00:22:49]. 
Christine Lewis: 
She is a storyteller, I tell you this woman here. Yes. 
 
Is there a food that she likes that you might have problems giving [00:23:00] 
her, or she would tell you ... because I believe she must be a little sassy, you 
know old ... You know what somebody said to me? You could clarify this for me, 
"We assume that when they attain a certain age, you take them to doctors, 
right? Like you are the caregiver. You take her to the doctor and the doctor is 
asking questions and you answering for her." Somebody reminded me that they 
are a person in the room who could articulate for themselves. Most time we 
speak for them. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
For them, [00:23:30] yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
I'm thinking around that way with food. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
First, her food is quite different because of her cultural and ethics. 
Christine Lewis: 
Which is? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
She's Jewish, so through the years, that I've been working with her, for seven 
years now, I have learnt a lot of their Jewish food.  
Christine Lewis: 
Well, excuse me. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
[00:24:00] It was a privilege that I was given permission even to prepare it- 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me stop you- 
Rosemarie Primo: 
... because they are- 
Christine Lewis: 
... not to interrupt you but you're an honorary Jew. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I'm an honorary Jew. Another cap. Another hat. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Rosemarie Primo: 
They are very particular with their Jewish rules when it pertains to their home 
and their [00:24:30] books and their food, so it's a privilege that I am given that 
leeway to prepare some of the food. 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I cannot lit the stove. 
Christine Lewis: 
You can't light the stove.  
Rosemarie Primo: 
No, she has to do that but once it is ... Just ignore it ... once it is lit, I can cook 
the soup, [00:25:00] I can prepare whatever she wants and then- 
Chris Mule: 
I'm sorry. I'll just pause for once second so I could fix your mic. 
Christine Lewis: 
You can't light the stove. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
No, we are not [00:25:30] allowed. 
Christine Lewis: 
Why? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Because that's one of their Jewish customs. 
Christine Lewis: 
Because you're a woman. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
It's not because I'm a woman, it's just that I am not Jewish. 
Christine Lewis: 
Interesting, okay. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I'm not Jewish so we are not permitted to light the stove. We are not permitted 
to put anything ... As they call our food, trayf, that's the word they use for food 
that is not kosher. Another word for it is [00:26:00] trayf so we cannot put trayf 
food in her fridge. If you buy it in their community, it's kosher food, you can put 
it in the fridge but other than that, you cannot. 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me ask you, is that confusing? For you, is that [crosstalk 00:26:19] 
Rosemarie Primo: 
In the beginning it was confusing but it's about acceptance. It's about 
acceptance. Would it be confusing? Yes, but you just have [00:26:30] to learn ... 
It's like going to a class to learn engineering. You have to learn the principles 
and healthcare is like that. You go into someone's home and you have to learn 
their principles and accept it. If not, you just leave, if you can't work with it, but 
it's better to work with it. It makes your day better because then, you are able 
to communicate better with [00:27:00] the client and then it's making your day 
easier.

We have three things to differentiate when the person is in the home, in a 
facility, he or she is a resident. When she's in the hospital, he or she is called a 
patient, and when she's serviced in her home, they are called clients, not 
patients, not residents, [00:27:30] but clients. It's easy once you get to fall in line 
and after seven years, it's like I've passed it with degree. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, so coming back to the food, is there anything that she likes or you enjoy 
making for her? Walk me through that or things that order in ... and more so, as 
the custom. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Right, as [00:28:00] custom, she does not like the meat food, food that contains 
meat. Food that doesn't contains meat, they call it [dairy 00:28:08], so she 
would more have food without meat. She'll have pasta, she'll have spinach, 
she'll have cottage cheese, yogurt, she prefers that kind of food. She like her 
cereal and milk. Sometime [00:28:30] for a whole two months that stove don't 
light because everything is just already there, precooked and everything and put 
there. Her salad, she love. I encourage her to eat her salad, to drink her water, 
she likes her coffee. 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me dig deeper. These things come in cans or packages or ... Because you 
don't have to light the stove. I'm just intrigued about all of this, there are so 
much genres to the job. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
When I don't light the stove, [00:29:00] they have an availability of a microwave 
and there's a grill, like a George Foreman grill that the food can be hot there, 
between there, the toaster, and a microwave. In general, is only if I have to cook 
an egg, then she will have to light the stove. If I have to cook an egg, I cannot 
crack the egg. She have to get up [00:29:30] and crack the egg and I can cook it. 
It's a whole new game over there. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, I'm thinking about this Trinidadian woman, working with this Jewish 
woman and having to go ... God bless you heart. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Like having to go a college to learn all aspects of their religion and custom so 
that I wouldn't defile their platform [00:30:00] because if you don't do it 
according to them, it's like a big sin, you defile what they believe in and their 
customs. 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me reiterate. She's the only person allowed to light her stove. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
If she needs this egg, she lights the stove her for the egg. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
And crack the egg. 
Christine Lewis: 
And crack the egg, you couldn't crack the egg? 
Domestic Workers United

Rosemarie Primo: 
No. If she wants it boiled- 
Christine Lewis: 
Is that recorded Chris? 
Chris Mule: 
[inaudible 00:30:26] 
Rosemarie Primo: 
If she wants it boiled, it's okay, but if she wants [00:30:30] it cooked otherwise, 
she has to crack the egg. 
Christine Lewis: 
Not you. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Not me, but I can complete the cooking. That's indenture for your money. I told 
you come with it. 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:31:00] Oh God, Father forgive us for we do not know what we do. Wow. You 
can't crack this egg. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
No I cannot. 
Christine Lewis: 
In all seriousness. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Serious, truth. In all seriousness, because one day I did it, and then she was very 
upset and she didn't hide it, "You're not supposed to. Our customs, Jewish 
customs ..." They're Hasidic Jews so there's even more [00:31:30] the religious 
Jews. They are the ones that has the religious curls, the payots, and wear the 
black so it's a different type of challenge. 
Christine Lewis: 
I like the fact that you said patience because it really does require patience. 
That's a skill that's a ... Not everybody ... You've worked there for seven years. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Seven years. 
Christine Lewis: 
I call you an honorary Jew, I really do. God bless your heart. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Seven years, mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I even, on the Shabbat, because [00:32:00] their prayer begins on Friday, so I 
prepare the table. 
Christine Lewis: 
What does that entail? Tell me. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
The Shabbat begins ... They say Shabbat, we Christians say Sabbath and it begins 
sundown, at different times on a Friday and ends at different times on a 
Saturday. A Friday for me there is seeing about her, getting [00:32:30] the meals 
for the Sabbath in place, and then setting the table for the Sabbath prayer on 
Domestic Workers United

Friday, which is getting the tablecloth, getting the candelabra, putting the 
challah, the bread, putting the salt. All the tabernacles, as we would call it, is 
placed on the table in preparation for [00:33:00] kaddish. 
Christine Lewis: 
Which is the next day. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Which is the next day. On a Friday when the [inaudible 00:33:06] blows, she 
goes to the candelabra, I assist her with lighting the candles and she gives her 
prayer. Then she would sit and pray, then on Saturdays, if the family are coming, 
then they say their kaddish and then visitors comes and she eats and whatever. 
[00:33:30] Then in the afternoon, if I am still on, she does the [havdalah 
00:33:36] which is the closing off of the Shabbat. 
 
It's a bit to learn. You're learning another part of how a person reside around 
their religion and it's okay. She's happy with me. 
Christine Lewis: 
That's what you call culture. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Culture. 
Christine Lewis: 
Interesting. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
She's happy with me and I'm happy [00:34:00] with her. She knows that I'm a 
Christian. I'm allowed to bring my bible to read. I can sit on the table with her 
and eat. Not the main dining table, but her kitchen has a table where we can sit 
and eat. She say I can eat anything in the place and I've seen a lot of their 
customs. Some I would keep private for the simple reason that it's [00:34:30] 
their religious ...  
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Why you can't sit at the big dining table? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
We are not allowed.  
Christine Lewis: 
Religious purpose. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Religious purpose. 
Christine Lewis: 
Tell me, when she gets cranky, and at 91 ... They say once a man, twice a child ... 
when she gets cranky, and she does, I believe she does, how you deal with it? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
When she gets cranky, first I ask what is wrong because [00:35:00] she has 
chronic physical pain. I have to determine if her crankiness is the pain, if she's 
hungry, or she just thinking of something happen to the family and she's upset.

She's a worrier, she worries about everything and like I tell her, "You worry 
about everything and you not fixing it because you didn't bring your hammer, 
you didn't bring your nails, you didn't bring your saw, [00:35:30] you didn't bring 
your hacksaw, you didn't bring a piece of rope, so how you going to fix this 
thing?" Then she say, "You're right Rosie." She would laugh like that and then 
she- 
Christine Lewis: 
She'd laugh. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yeah. I say, "You're worrying about everything and you didn't bring your nails, 
you didn't bring your hammer, you didn't bring a saw, you didn't bring your 
tapeline to measure how much of the worries you going to fix, [00:36:00] so 
how you going to fix this thing?" Then she would laugh and say, "You're right 
Rosie, you're right, but I'm just a worrier." I say, "You need to stop worrying 
because worry affects your stomach, because you can't eat and your mobility is 
slower," because she had a fractured hip fixed it so, she has a deep impede 
[00:36:30] walking. I say "Then you just have to relax, you got to relax." She 
don't sleep day and she don't sleep night. 
Christine Lewis: 
They say the older you become, you sleep less at nights, right? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
How is that? How does that impact you though, if you stay over? I know your 
job is from a certain time to a certain time. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yeah but I think her sleep pattern is convenience, if I should say so, because if I 
work at night, she sleeps. 
Christine Lewis: 
Interesting. [00:37:00] You think it's the different charisma? I'm just interjecting 
but ... 
Rosemarie Primo: 
It's not that. You see when the city changed her plan into shared hours, when I 
started with her, it was one work in the day and one work in the night. 
Christine Lewis: 
One worker. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Then they split it into two. Two in the daytime, two in 
the night [00:37:30] time. The night time would come in and do their own thing. 
They'd never followed what was laid. 
Christine Lewis: 
In the daytime. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
In the daytime. She became totally off-guard. When I started with her, 10 
o'clock she's in her bed. 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
13
Rosemarie Primo: 
This is something too, indentured workers have to put up with because when 
you place the client on a schedule [00:38:00] and the others come in and they 
take her off the schedule and they ... It's like if you're working and you have ... 
It's a power struggle for you because now this patient is totally off schedule. 
Christine Lewis: 
So you have to do it again. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I have to do it again. Like one night I worked, she's going to bed with a bottle of 
water, candy, a notebook with pencil, she has her radio, she has a phone that 
plays music all the [00:38:30] time. I tell her, "You're not going to sleep, you're 
going on a picnic," These are things you are going to- 
Christine Lewis: 
She writes? She actually writes in this book? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
She gets up and look at it. I say, "These are things we take on a picnic to the 
park when we relaxing so you not going to sleep. These are things that you put 
your mind on and it's keeping you awake." Whenever I have to work a night, she 
knows she's not getting those [00:39:00] things. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
She knows she's not getting those things so it makes my job and her nights 
better. She's not getting these things.  
 
I sort of have her in a time because you get up ... "I know you have the urinary 
problems so I time you. Every two hours, I'm going to assist you to what you 
need to do, and other than [00:39:30] that, you're okay." With the others it's 
not that. 
Christine Lewis: 
Which brings me to the next question. You talk about chronic pain and then the 
urinary thing that she's got. Is there any [inaudible 00:39:41] that you bring 
from ... I know they go to the doctor and the western medicine, but is there 
anything that you use from where you come from, homeopathic, that you give 
to her, or suggest, as you may. You know everything for the western world is 
doctor, [00:40:00] doctor, and we have these little things, these little tinctures 
that we use for whatever it is that is. Does that ever come into play with you 
working there? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
The thing is that this particular client would not eat anything from me because it 
is non-Jewish and even though I may suggest something, they're not going to 
use it because it's out of their religious phenomena, [00:40:30] so they would 
not use it, so I wouldn't even suggest it. I cannot being any food from me for her 
to eat. It's not going to work, so that is ... 
Christine Lewis: 
What it is, just what it is. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
It is what it is, yes. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
14
Christine Lewis: 
We talk about your patient but we haven't talked about the family. What is your 
relationship with the family and do you bring anything to that family, as 
religious as they are? [00:41:00] Is there something that you taught them? As 
religious, a-religious as they are, what you bring to that ... yeah. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Sure. They have accepted me as a Christian because normally they would not do 
that. 
Christine Lewis: 
They wouldn't hire somebody like you to take care of their mother. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
No, they would not. That was a A plus in itself [00:41:30] and they have 
accepted who I am and my religious belief and through certain celebrations that 
they celebrate like Purim and Hanukkah and ... I explained to them that the 
celebration comes, like Kwanzaa, Christmas, [00:42:00] Hanukkah, but what is 
important in all three, it has lights and we are not sitting in darkness. I have 
brought that sort of knowledge to them. It is not so much we worshiping a Santa 
Claus or a man in a red suit, because they don't observe Christmas. I want to 
instill in them it is not really all the materialistic [00:42:30] things of the holiday. 
What we should be focusing on, all three religious thing comprises of lights and 
God said, when he created the light, he examined the light, God said, and he 
said that the light is good, so I brought that to them. 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow, how they take that teaching? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Very well. They was like, "Oh, Rosie, oh, [00:43:00] that is something new," 
because they thinking of more the materialistic things because they don't 
observe Christmas. They don't hold the concept that God has his son. They don't 
hold that. Their Messiah is God coming back. We as Christians, we know that 
God sent his son [00:43:30] and he said his son is coming back, but they do not 
hold ... They don't call Jesus the Messiah. They look as God as the Messiah.  
 
Then you have to respect their belief. As domesticated workers, the client's 
home is not yours, so you cannot go and force your religious belief or choke it 
down her throat or tell [00:44:00] her what she's doing is wrong and call down 
"Hail Mary" on her. You can't do that. You can't do that. You have to accept 
what she is, give her the respect what she is, and when you see something 
where they're practicing, if I am there, I just leave the room, the area, go for a 
walk and give them [00:44:30] their privacy. Even in that kind of a catalyst, you 
have to always remember it is not your home. Some indentured workers come 
in and is like they want to take over the lady's home and tell her about the 
religion and it's wrong. I don't do that. 
Christine Lewis: 
Tell me, what is the best part of the job? Give me an example. What is the 
[00:45:00] best part of this job? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
The best part of this job is listening to her stories from Europe, because she 
came here to America from Hungary. She was one of those on the ship escaping 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
15
the renaissance of Hitler. They came as free [00:45:30] to America, more or less. 
Quite recently, I was saying "How the time goes," and she said to me, her father 
would always say ... "Rosie, time is the biggest stealer." That is one of her 
common phrases, "Time is the biggest stealer." I said why, because she says "It 
goes so fast and it doesn't wait for you, it steals everything." [00:46:00] She 
reminded me, when she was having one of her sons and he got ill, she had to 
travel so far from Hungary on the back of a train and she had to hide because if 
the soldiers see her, they would have killed her and she had to go to a far place 
to have the baby in a special hospital. 
 
The best part of my job is when we sit and reminisce on these ... my stories and 
her stories. [00:46:30] She would always say to me, "Rosie, you are not black." 
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
"Why would you say that?" "You are not black, look at the inside of your hands. 
You have white Rosie." She say, "Yeah, look at the inside of your hands. The 
other girl's hands not like yours Rosie." That's her interpretation, what 
[00:47:00] can I say. That's her interpretation. 
Christine Lewis: 
Interesting. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yeah and she has given me, as a religious person, a Hasidic Jew, a lot of 
openness, where the other workers wouldn't do it, cannot do it, I am given that 
opportunity to do it, so I am blessed. 
Christine Lewis: 
Amen. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I am blessed. 
Christine Lewis: 
Tell me now, what [00:47:30] is the worst part of your job? You know Aurora I 
do ... you know I do Purim with the Jews right?  
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Just for racial and economic justice, and Aurora Levins Morales said, she's a 
Jewish Puerto Rican writer, she was part of the conversation, she said, "Our 
stories are our medicines." It's interesting when you said that, that part that she 
gives you, and you were able to tell her and that story is kind of what, post the 
Holocaust right? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Right. Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Not pre-Holocaust, [00:48:00] post-Holocaust right. Here it is this Caribbean 
woman sitting in this woman's home listening to this story from way back, when 
you didn't even dream to be born, as a matter of fact, to hear this woman talk 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
16
about. You telling her your stories from whence you come. That is liberating and 
that's medicine right there. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes and she has a tape, she has a special ... As a matter of fact, my great-
grandfather used to sing that song. 
Christine Lewis: 
What is the song? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
It's called Mama [00:48:30] Lee 00:48:29]. It's a man speaking about his mother 
and how he love his mother. The daughter bought a cd for her and that song 
was on it. I started to sing it and she was like- 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me hear a verse of it nah? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
She was like "Oh Rosie, I didn't know this. This is in Hungary." I say, "You know 
something, music ... You can pick up music once you get the rhythm. I may not 
be able to speak Hungarian, [00:49:00] but I know what he was saying." Every 
time she play the cd, Rosie, come and hear [Mama Lee 00:49:07]." 
Christine Lewis: 
Music is universal so- 
Rosemarie Primo: 
It's universal so she likes the idea that I have a little of the music that ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Give me a refrain from [Mama Lee 00:49:23]. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
It talked about, [00:49:30] (singing). 
Christine Lewis: 
Nice Rosie! Rosie you could sing! 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
You sing it to her too? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
[00:50:00] Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. What she says when you sing it? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
She called all their Jewish [00:50:30] people, rabbi, assistant rabbi- 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes, to hear you sing it. I hope they give you more [00:51:00] money for that.  
Chris Mule: 
Yep. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah right. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Rosemarie Primo: 
The son acknowledging his mother so every time the mother lights the Shabbat 
candle and she whisper her prayer, he knows that the the mother loves him and 
he knows that the prayer is good so ... she talked about- 
Christine Lewis: 
Interestingly enough, your grandfather sang it, your great grandfather. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). My great grandfather and my grandfather used 
[00:51:30] to sing it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow.  
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yep. Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Christine Lewis: 
See, our stories are our medicine. Aurora Levins Morales, let me give it props to 
who it belongs. 
 
Tell me, what is the worst part of your job and you tell me ... What is the worst 
part of your job? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Should I discuss that incident? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yes, yes! 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Is it going to be edited? 
Christine Lewis: 
Tell it. That is why we storytelling. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Okay, we had an encounter [00:52:00] with two of her grandsons. It wasn't very 
pleasant but it was the Shabbat and they came close to me and then he asked 
me to display my body to him to see if my oracles or my breasts is the same 
color as his. [00:52:30] These are teenagers. 
Christine Lewis: 
Little boys. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Little boys, so I said to them, "This is not Sabbath appropriate, and I'm adult." 
One of the boys said to me, "Well Rosie, ladies walk with their self exposed." I 
said, "But I'm a Christian and we have to cover." I say, "Have you ever seen me 
come into you grandmother's house like this?" He said, [00:53:00] "No," but 
they insisting." Then he came close to me and I said, "It's going too far," so I 
asked them to go back to the table with their grandparents. Then I told ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Could we take it off? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
Or put it on low so [00:53:30] that ... 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
18
Rosemarie Primo: 
Once it takes off ... Okay. Let me take it off [inaudible 00:53:34]. Okay, so my- 
Christine Lewis: 
We could start again? 
Chris Mule: 
Go ahead. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
So I told the- 
Christine Lewis: 
To go back to the table. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
To table and [00:54:00] I thought of it and I said, "If I don't discuss it with their 
parents, it would probably re-occur again." I waited a day, I didn't tell the client, 
I didn't tell any other person. I went and lodged the complaint with the relative, 
their parents, and lo and behold, a couple weeks after, they brought a rabbi 
[00:54:30] to speak to me. 
Christine Lewis: 
You talked to the parents and the parents bring the rabbi. Why? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Because he is of the opinion that ... Like I am turning on these boys. I said to 
him, "First you have to know my personality. You cannot just come in here to 
discuss anything with me and the boys said a statement, [00:55:00] his sister 
shows his father. That struck me [inaudible 00:55:07] and I told them- 
Christine Lewis: 
Hold up. The sister shows ... 
Rosemarie Primo: 
The father- 
Christine Lewis: 
Her breasts. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
The sister shows the father, I don't know what she shows. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, but she shows the father. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I don't know if is something that he saw. I do not know if is something that is 
continuing and he got threatened and [00:55:30] he come to tell it to me. I don't 
know how to take it.  
 
When the rabbi came, I said, "The problem is not with me and I know that at 
times, you all tend to blame the black women and this is not about color, this is 
about respect and dignity," because they wouldn't watch one of their women 
and make that [00:56:00] comment. "I am telling you now, you go back to the 
home and fix it. There is certainly a problem within that home that you need to 
have addressed." Then he turned to me and he said, "They are boys." No, they 
are not boys. Boys will grow into men looking at women, whether we are 
dressed or not [00:56:30] and disrespect them if you don't correct it right then 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
19
and there. I said, "I don't want to speak with you," and I end the conversation 
there, so that was the worst part of it.  
Christine Lewis: 
Did the boys ever come around again? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yeah they came. Yes they come and I don't know what took place in their home, 
I have been to [00:57:00] their home several times and it's not ... It's okay but- 
Christine Lewis: 
I mean to say that they give you the respect now.  
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes, they gave me the respect. 
Christine Lewis: 
They fall back. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
They fall back. They gave me the respect and now they're more older- 
Christine Lewis: 
They were testing you a minute. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Exactly, they are older so ... But the conceptualization of that is, because they 
don't see me as the perfect pure Jewish woman, they [00:57:30] think they can 
say and do whatever they want because that's the training they get. They get a 
training only to respect the women of their culture and their religious status. I 
even have to say, "You may see someone naked on the road but you are not to 
condemn them because you don't know what that person went through even to 
get to that point. You don't know. 
Christine Lewis: 
Out of order. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
[00:58:00] Then he looked at me like, "Okay, we can't break Rosie so we just 
have to secede and just leave it like that." 
Christine Lewis: 
What is the relationship with you and their parents? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
It's okay. It's all right. They know I don't take any nonsense. I don't. I don't and 
the client knows it, [00:58:30] they know it, because sometimes you work with a 
client and their relatives feel you work with them too and they can come in and 
they will belittle you and order you and I tell them, "If you want to do my job, 
you're free to do it. You are free to do it."  
 
Leave it. 
Chris Mule: 
You sure? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yeah. "You are free to do it." From day one, I put the [00:59:00] line how far you 
can go with me.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
20
Christine Lewis: 
I'm curious as we talk about that, because you're right. The inferiority-
superiority raised its head, so what's curious about the relationship because to 
me, the rabbi passes it off as they're just boys, it's nothing because ... Is it the 
color of your skin? I hate to say that, as women here, the domesticated women 
and women of color, let's be real. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Christine Lewis: 
You're right. Here it is this conversation of this indecent [00:59:30] thing that 
they're coming with you. They wouldn't do it with anybody else. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
No they wouldn't do it. 
Christine Lewis: 
You're right. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
They wouldn't do it. 
Christine Lewis: 
They're so a-religious, but here it is, you're the black woman in the home. It's so 
subtle though and you don't want to call it that, but it's really what some of us 
go through. They feel they could get ... You're a much older woman to these 
women ... As a matter of fact, you woulda give them a licking on they bottom as 
we get in Trinidad for just being out of order. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
Here it is they have to call the rabbi to pacify this. It's so wrong. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
The boy is asking me, "Why you don't [01:00:00] show it?" I said, "Because it's 
wrong, that's why. It is-" 
Christine Lewis: 
But the rabbi- 
Rosemarie Primo: 
The son, before the rabbi came in, he's insisting, "But why?" I say, "Because you 
don't understand it's wrong. You don't expose your bodies to people. It is 
wrong." He couldn't- 
Christine Lewis: 
The way the rabbi pacifies it though- 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Is like "Ah, nothing." What he's telling me is they [01:00:30] are right because 
they does see it everyday on the street with black women. 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow, and they're boys. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
And they're boys, so he is giving them more justification over me. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes, that's my point. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
21
Rosemarie Primo: 
No, you don't do that. "Rabbi I am a Christian woman." You know what I told 
him? I said, "I am Israel. I am Israel and we as Israels speak a different language, 
walk [01:01:00] a different walk, behave in a different way and dress a different 
way. If you don't see it rabbi, something is wrong with you." 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. 
Chris Mule: 
You're dealing with a very conservative mindset and one thing you bring to this 
is your religious understanding, multicultural understanding, but unfortunately 
the orthodox [01:01:30] community can be very conservative and arrogant- 
Christine Lewis: 
Patriarchal. 
Chris Mule: 
Very arrogant. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Very arrogant, yeah. 
Chris Mule: 
I don't mean to say that but I mean- 
Christine Lewis: 
It is though. 
Chris Mule: 
Yeah, but I mean you address someone approaching you to ask you to expose 
yourself but you approached it ... You tapped into your religious understanding. 
They might be thinking their curiosity is based on their lack of exposure to other 
people and maybe an understanding that [01:02:00] the purity aspect of the 
way they treat women [crosstalk 01:02:05] all of that. Its very interesting. 
Christine Lewis: 
Let's be real. If it was even a white woman who wasn't orthodox, they would 
know their limits. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
They would not do it. 
Christine Lewis: 
They wouldn't do it.  
Rosemarie Primo: 
They would not do it. 
Christine Lewis: 
If it was a regular woman who is not orthodox who comes in to see their 
grandparents, oh no, they might have looked at her with longing eyes, but they 
wouldn't go [01:02:30] to make that ascertation to want to touch or feel. Out of 
order. I'm just curious how the ... Look at the things that we have to work 
through, as women of color. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
These are all the task. These are all the insipidness that women of color- 
Christine Lewis: 
Today. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
... in today's world- 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
22
Christine Lewis: 
It brings me back to defy that ... The segue of domestic work from [01:03:00] 
now, from when and when I enter, from now to back then in the fifties or even 
in 1935 before the new deal. Think about women who are working in the 
backwoods of Alabama, Mississippi being touched and manhandled and here 
we talking about it in 2016. You understand? Still fighting to get what is ours. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
What I think about, there are domesticated women that don't have the strong 
voice as you and I, [01:03:30] even in now, and they are stuffed in a box. They 
can't speak what is wrong. Their employers brutalize them, their relatives brutal 
... and they don't have a voice. I told them ... We iron it out, rabbi was whatever 
and I just like, "Okay, that's it." 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me cut to the chase. How does that make you feel? [01:04:00] What are 
your emotional ... How do you manage in the advent of that? How do you 
manage your emotional feelings with the family? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
At first I was angry because I think they didn't take a realistic approach. It's a 
problem that needed to be dealt with. I was angry, to the extent that they 
brought in the rabbi and ... I find, as parents, this happen [01:04:30] in your 
home, you can fix it without the intervention of someone else, but I guess that's 
the protocol that they take. Then after, I felt empathy because I am sure I am 
not the first and I'm not the last person that has experienced something 
distasteful from other religious person or non-religious person, while [01:05:00] 
working in their home.  
 
As a matter of fact, this is my second encounter. When I came here in '89/'90, I 
was working with another set of Jewish people and they were renovating a 
house and they had this Russian guy who attacked me and stuff in there. Like 
I'm prone to the bees but in time, you get [01:05:30] over it. 
Christine Lewis: 
What, he touched you? When you say attacked, what ... 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I had a newborn baby, she had a newborn baby and she went for her post-
checkup and he came. He was doing repairs and he said he needed to get down 
in the basement to get something and I am there trying to- 
Christine Lewis: 
Pacify the baby. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
... feed this newborn and he just came and start choking me in my neck. I 
[01:06:00] was much younger and very agile and he wouldn't get off of me so ... 
Before that, I accidentally took a knife and cut the wrong food. The knife was for 
dairy and I cut a piece of meat with the knife so she told me I had to throw away 
the knife.  
 
This religion, if you only put something in the stove that you not supposed to, 
you have to throw away the stove, [01:06:30] so it's very costly if you make a 
mistake, to them, because they have to put things out. She told me to throw 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
23
away the knife. I came around, put it in the garbage and then something say, 
"You better take that knife out, you probably would need it. You could have it." I 
took it and I hid it in a cupboard that they don't frequently use but on top. 
[01:07:00] That day, I was sitting close the ... feeding the baby when he choked 
me. He pass around my neck and he start choking me. 
Christine Lewis: 
Just so? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Christine Lewis: 
Nothing provoked that. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes, and he's big. I looked around, I turned the tap away and I put the newborn 
in the kitchen sink. Then that was the number. We just start fighting, I broke up 
a chair. 
Christine Lewis: 
[01:07:30] Really? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yeah, in 1989. 
Christine Lewis: 
What, he just didn't like you? What ... 
Rosemarie Primo: 
They say he brings all kind of women ... He is a sex-crazed man. 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh. He was working for her. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
He was working for her. 
Christine Lewis: 
When you reported that, what became of that though? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
When she came, I called her, I told her what took place. He had a bicycle, she 
tow the bicycle. Her mother came, this person came, and then she say, "My 
husband will investigate [01:08:00] it and so forth and so forth." At that time 
now, my status wasn't straight. I didn't know my rights. I didn't have anybody to 
guide me through that, so I had to just suck it up, so to speak. I realize now 
that's abuse and they could have been charged. 
Christine Lewis: 
An assault. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
An assault, but anything it went and after that I left, because [01:08:30] they 
didn't want to get rid of him, he's going cheap labor on this house and then I 
just left after a year. 
Christine Lewis: 
Again, the domesticated woman lives matters nothing. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Nothing, yes, to some people. To some people. Now, other women are raising 
the barrier of that. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
24
Christine Lewis: 
Right. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Right, we are raising the barrier of that and we are putting a voice out there that 
we need you and you need us. It's equal scale, because in fact, [01:09:00] they 
don't take care of their relatives so they have to depend on an outside source. 
They take care of the relative by come sitting but when to feed them and bathe 
them, they depend on an outside source to do that. 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me go back to emotional feeling as we talk about those boys, those horrible 
boys who did this horrible thing to you. You manage your feeling as you talk 
about your husband not being here and I know you gave a tip of it at the 
beginning, you kind of answer, you went in and out, even [01:09:30] these 
questionnaires that we have here, to tell you the truth. Some, you really a 
painted a picture of all your situation, but how do you deal with ... You're so 
strong though and I know you rely on your faith and you said it before, but how 
do you manage? 
 
Your husband isn't here, he's in a living facility with complexities of illnesses, 
then you have this woman who you have to be really excellent with too because 
that takes a toll, you have to administer that medicine then deal with the people 
[01:10:00] who ... The agency, blah, blah, blah. It's a lot. You said it before, when 
you come in, you could be lonely but your faith informs. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
How do you manage your emotional feelings, with all that you're giving care to? 
Your husband, that family then you have another patient because it's three in 
all. You have your husband, you have that job there ... 
Rosemarie Primo: 
And another patient. 
Christine Lewis: 
And another patient, [01:10:30] my Lord.  
Rosemarie Primo: 
Like I say, I pick the peas and leave the corns. The reason for that is, when I'm 
finished my day's work, I don't think about my job. I don't bring my job home. 
When I'm here, it's all about my prayer, it's all about my meditation. I don't 
even think about a bill. [01:11:00] I take like three hours. Sometimes I come in, I 
shower, I go on the bed, I sleep. If I get up one o'clock in the morning, I get up 
one o'clock, I do whatever I had to do. I don't practice bringing my job into my 
home. I told a friend and she say, "You know Rose, I must start doing that." 
When my sister call, I don't talk about my job. We talk about other things. I 
don't bring my [01:11:30] work home because it's like you wouldn't get a 
window of escape in your mind. 
Christine Lewis: 
Tell me, do you feel that the amount of hours you work and your holiday 
schedules have been respected? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
25
Rosemarie Primo: 
My amount of hours I worked. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah and your holiday schedules, are they being respected? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes, yeah, pretty much. 
Christine Lewis: 
You don't have a issue with ... 
Rosemarie Primo: 
No, I don't have an issue with [01:12:00] holidays. 
Christine Lewis: 
Your hours, you're pretty much ... 
Rosemarie Primo: 
My hours are ... I still say I am blessed because I am still working more than 
what the city stipulates because they have downsized a lot on the amount of 
hours and thank God I am doing much more than that and it's remaining there, 
thank God so I ... 
Christine Lewis: 
[01:12:30] You're blessed. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I am blessed. 
Christine Lewis: 
You're going 40 hours a week. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I am doing more than 40 hours a week. 
Christine Lewis: 
That works for you. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
That works for me, yes, I am blessed. 
Christine Lewis: 
Why I ask because you know we have ... But you get paid because you know 
that's with the Bill of Rights, after 40 hours is overtime and 44, if you're live-in, is 
overtime. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. You're savoriness and your [01:13:00] charisma works for you and you're 
right, some people don't have that certain type of je ne sais quoi or voice that 
you talk about, to talk back or say this is right. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Would you say that, and I heard you mention it in some part of your speech, 
being undocumented when you came and being used to that form of abuse and 
you did not knowing any your rights, would you say that you or any worker that 
you know has been exploited due to immigration status? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Sure.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
26
Christine Lewis: 
You could name [01:13:30] one of- 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Sure, like I had ... We met on the train and we would speak and like me, when 
we first came here, we- 
Christine Lewis: 
Undocumented. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
... undocumented and she tried to get hooked up by marriage and it didn't work. 
It was supposed to be a business marriage but then the guy [01:14:00] didn't 
want to leave her and he stuck around until it became abusive. She married an 
Indian guy from Pakistan and she went to Pakistan with him and she said she 
didn't like it, so she came back and when they went into the immigration and 
they started discuss with her, the answers weren't adding up, only to find out he 
married in Pakistan but he's really using her as [01:14:30] a scapegoat to bring 
his wife over here.  
 
These kind of stories we hear. It's sad because we are only trying to put a place 
in a strange world, because when I came to America it felt strange to me and we 
just trying to make it do, make it happen, make [01:15:00] our dreams- 
Christine Lewis: 
The American dream, whatever that is. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Whatever that is. 
Christine Lewis: 
What that does like though? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
The American dream wasn't ... I have to say, again, God has been merciful to me 
because I didn't have it ... Besides the incident ... but to say I had a struggling 
time or a hard time in this country, even in my years being undocumented, I've 
been blessed. When I heard some stories that people had to go [01:15:30] 
through, I've not come across that. 
Christine Lewis: 
I know we went through half of these things already, but do you share any 
cultural thing from your heritage with your family that you work for, for 
example ... Food you say that's off limit. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Off limit, yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
I know you talk about the folk tales. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes we talk- 
Christine Lewis: 
Like how you take to her story, how does she take to your story, I'm curious. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
As a matter of fact, some of the things that we speak about, she do it in Europe 
and Hungary. [01:16:00] They might just call it a different name but they do it 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
27
the same way. Like we used to cook in the tin pan oven, bake the bread on the 
plait and they do it the same way. We linkup to a certain ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Extent. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
... extent, with some things- 
Christine Lewis: 
Cultures. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
... with culture. We had backyard garden, she said they used to plant all the 
squash and that's what we do also. She say they used to go and [01:16:30] had 
to wash with ... They didn't have all these ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Technology. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
... technology and machine and everything. You had the blue soap. I say "We 
used to do the same thing too." A lot of her young, growing up days assimilated 
to my growing up days so we had a link, we had a connection. You see. 
Christine Lewis: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). What is your overall relationship with everybody within 
that family network? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Very good. 
Christine Lewis: 
Very [01:17:00] good. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Very good. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Very good. They call me Rosie, so everything, "Rosie knows." They ask me what 
time Shabbat begins, that's to tell you. They asking me, Rosie the Christian 
woman, what time Shabbat begins. 
Christine Lewis: 
Interesting. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
It's interesting. 
Christine Lewis: 
What memorable time that conjures up in your mind that you have done that 
made you ... that [01:17:30] stands out? Whether it's with kids that you work 
with or even this elderly woman, what memorable would you take? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
What memory I would take. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. Are there relationships with previous children you have cared for that are 
particularly memorable in a good or bad way? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
28
Rosemarie Primo: 
It is so much. 
Christine Lewis: 
You talk about the boy, but give me something that's memorable because you 
talk about a- 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I loved ... My memory was with this child I used to tutor in Manhattan, 
Alexandra. I call her "Sweet [01:18:00] pea" and she would never say "Rosie", 
she always say, "My Rosie," and I said to her, "Why do you say My Rosie?" She 
say "Because my mom said when she was looking for a babysitter, and you 
came, she say, 'Alexandra I got a Rosie for you. Your Rosie' so you are my Rosie." 
Christine Lewis: 
That's so cute. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
All so cute, so we have good memories. We still [01:18:30] keep in 
communication, she's into medicine and she still calls me "My Rosie," I still call 
her my "Sweet pea". I have her picture in my bible and she ... Sometime when 
we call, she say, "Rosie, did you pray for me today?" I said "Yes." 
Christine Lewis: 
How old is she now? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
She's 20, 20/21. I made her promise to me when she going to college, she 
wouldn't get into bad things, do drugs [01:19:00] and all of that. She say, "Rosie, 
I miss you, I love you," and I said, "I hope you will remember what I did." 
Somewhere I saw ... This week I saw a little thing that she wrote a day when she 
was nine years old, for me, in camp.  
 
My best memory is working with that child. It was working with that child. 
Christine Lewis: 
Something to remember. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
Tell me now, how do you manage your personal [01:19:30] life, family life, and 
your ... She kind of touched that, right? Did she? 
Chris Mule: 
Yeah, mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Christine Lewis: 
So we could go on? 
Chris Mule: 
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, sure. That's fine. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
How I manage that? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah but how you manage, yeah, because your husband ... I know you come 
home in the night, I know it's ... You know sometimes- 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
29
Rosemarie Primo: 
I set a schedule for myself and I stick to that schedule. I have my time to church. 
I have my time to be alone, play my music. I have my [01:20:00] time when I 
would go out and shop and just walk. It's about a schedule and I try not to let 
one schedule overlaps into the next because to me, when I do that, it collapse 
my whole rhythm.  
Christine Lewis: 
Let me bring you back to a place because I call you pastor too and I'll tell you 
something, we're talking about pastors but back in the days, that's [01:20:30] 
what this woman used to do. You bring women together in a ... how? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Impromptu way. 
Christine Lewis: 
No, no, no. In your prayer breakfast. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Oh yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
On top of doing all that she does- 
Chris Mule: 
Wow. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
We didn't even talk about that- 
Christine Lewis: 
That's why I ask you. She bring women together in her prayer breakfast. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
She cares for the elderly, she cares for her husband, who is in a home, who she 
has to visit everyday, and she cares for this other patient- 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Two other patient, two patients. I have two clients. 
Christine Lewis: 
And goes to church, [01:21:00] and plan a prayer breakfast. This woman does 
this. 
Chris Mule: 
Amazing. Can I just use your restroom [crosstalk 01:21:05]?  
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes. 
Chris Mule: 
You can keep talking. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Right door, just there, that small door and the light on the wall. Yes Christine. 
Christine Lewis: 
How you do it? That's why I'm curious. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Like is said, it's schedule.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
30
Christine Lewis: 
I look at you and I say, "This woman planning this thing and how she does this 
and ..." 
Rosemarie Primo: 
It's not temporariness. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, yeah, that's the word.  
Rosemarie Primo: 
It's not- 
Christine Lewis: 
And go to see your husband. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Right and [01:21:30] you know something- 
Christine Lewis: 
And go to work. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yeah, and you know something, we have to identify our storm, and why I say 
that, storm comes with warning but these storms of life don't come with 
warnings. You just get up and you in a turmoil. No job, can't [01:22:00] meet 
your rent, husband gone leave you with kids. Sometimes these storms don't give 
you warning, but I have learn to be truthful to myself and to identify your storm. 
You have to tell God exactly what your storm is. Once you do that and 
[01:22:30] he gives you the mechanism to toil with those storms, then you are 
able to maneuver other things. You can't ask God, "I'm in a storm, help me," but 
you're not specifically stating to him the name of the storms you are in. I tend 
now, to identify my storm.  
 
My husband wants to come back home here, [01:23:00] but they said based on 
his health and everything, the apartment is too small. It's not crowded, but it's 
too small and twice a person came and walked through and she looked at it and 
because he'd be coming home with wheelchair and thing, it's not too small, it's 
not wheelchair bound, it doesn't have handrails. It doesn't have things that he 
would need now. I am on the prayer line with [01:23:30] God ...  
Christine Lewis: 
About this.  
Rosemarie Primo: 
About this. I identify, "This is a storm. He wants to come home and he has a 
right to those feelings. He has been away from his home almost two years. He 
has a right to those feelings and I am asking God, this storm, and I identify it. I 
think when I do that, I feel better. I may not see the answer now, [01:24:00] I 
may see the prospective of moving or anything but just the consolation within 
that I was able to speak it, makes me feel better. I am not sitting in a 
temporariness mode. That's not for me. 
Christine Lewis: 
That was your preaching mantra right? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
31
Christine Lewis: 
Temporariness. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes, no more temporariness. 
Christine Lewis: 
You- 
Chris Mule: 
I [01:24:30] just have a question, I'm sorry to interrupt. Does it influence the 
way you care for your clients, having care for your husband? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes, very much so. It works both ways because sometimes when I go to see my 
husband and he's sad or depressed or something, I say, "I leave work, I leave my 
client in [01:25:00] this manner and you have so much to be thankful for." I said, 
"She has chronic pain, she has a bad hip, she has two broken ..." and I start to 
list, identify. I start to identify the things that I have to work with, with this 
client, "So when I come to you, I'm not saying I'm pushing you aside, I'm not 
saying you're not suffering, but ..." Then he would turn and say "You know 
[01:25:30] I ain't that bad, I don't have all that," and he start to perk up. It work 
both ways. 
 
Sometimes when my clients start and I say, "Don't forget Rosie has a husband in 
a home" and then she would say, "Oh yes, oh my god, in a home to go every 
night is very tiring." Then she kinds of mellow down.  
 
It's both sides of the spectrum. It's connected by [01:26:00] a rainbow, but it's 
both sides of the spectrum. 
Christine Lewis: 
Like that. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. Resilience girl, resilience. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
There is a rainbow between but it's both sides of the spectrum so I have to 
juggle it and you have to give yourself space. 
Christine Lewis: 
Within all that you do, are you a part of an organization? I know that DWU is 
difficult for you because of the way you work, your church, the Saturdays that 
you work, you really can't come but I know your heart [01:26:30] really- 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Is there. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. It's for womanhood and the upliftment of womanhood, but besides that, is 
there any other organization that you belong to? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I wish I could have been in an organization but as you stated, my time schedule 
don't belong so most time I'm just doing in-house activities with my church. I 
want to do something more, I hope that my prayer breakfast would be an 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
32
organization in itself, [01:27:00] around the prayer breakfast where I can do 
more stuff with the women and stuff like that.  
 
Like this year, one of the ladies say, "Miss Rose, I didn't know you were so 
religious" and she say, "I came and I prayed and I got a job." It was 18 months, 
she didn't work so I wanted to reach out to as many people, not women in 
specific, [01:27:30] but people, because when we heal the people, we have a 
good nation. 
Christine Lewis: 
I know you hear about DWU and you hear it from me. What are your thoughts 
in hearing it from me? What do you think about when I talk about DWU? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I think it is fantastic, it's eccentric, it's needed because it's an outlet where 
women know that someone is on the other side [01:28:00] and creating a space 
for them to come in and to voice their approval. What I would like to see is 
more publication of the DWU. On the TV, because, I know everybody have their 
Facebook but not everybody, like me, I don't have a computer, can't afford it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Right. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Right, so I would like to see pamphlets and booklets handing out on the train, to 
... 
Christine Lewis: 
[01:28:30] Advocate. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
... to advocate this sort of things. Like when you have a rally or something so 
more people can know of the DWU and what their work is. 
Christine Lewis: 
We got a Bill of Rights passed in 2010, you know that right? You also know that. 
What are your thoughts on that though? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I think it's great- 
Christine Lewis: 
What does it mean to you? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
It means that we [01:29:00] are being recognized. As the old people would say, 
"We are becoming a force to be reckoned with," so look out women, for black 
women. We have come a long way.  
 
Like the other day I was doing something and this girl says, "Rose, the sky is the 
limit." I say "Not for me. Don't tell me the sky [01:29:30] is the limit when we 
have footprints on the moon." Again, don't you put yourself in temporariness, 
you always keep reaching. If you're saying the sky is the limit, that means you 
cut off from going further and that's just a period of temporariness. 
Christine Lewis: 
Let's assume that a legislator is [01:30:00] listening or you go to our meeting. 
What you want them to know on the heels of the Bill of Rights? The Bill of Rights 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
33
mandate 40 hours, after 40 hours work overtime. You work 40 hours, after that 
is overtime, 44 hours if you're live-in, overtime. For those who live-in, three 
days off per year, that you work and discrimination against ... 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Your religion and- 
Christine Lewis: 
Religion, sexual abuse [01:30:30] and all of that. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
You could create ... On the heels of that, we got three things. What would you 
want a legislator to know? 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I would like them to advocate ... I would like them to know too, in depth, the 
finances, because I think that is a major core. Even though the Bill [01:31:00] of 
Rights are in place, there is still going to be some unscrupulous employer that 
would not want to meet the standard of that, and who is above to investigate 
that? The captain have to have another captain over, so to speak.  
 
The legislators are there but they cannot go to every place to see that what they 
put on paper is [01:31:30] straight across the board because women are going 
to be always coming to this side of the globe, whether they come legally or 
illegally and they are going to be abused financially. Even though that is in place, 
I know some girls, they still are not getting what is right to due for them and 
they do not know that this avenue [01:32:00] is available to them so the 
legislators cannot always sit on the inside and talk. They have to get out more 
and let the people know that this is what is available. 
Christine Lewis: 
What area of education or skills are you looking to gain? I like the fact that you 
say the sky is not the limit because there's footprints on the moon, I love that. 
Rosemarie Primo: 
I would want to [01:32:30] acquire the highest status in religious studies. I like 
to do religious studies and I think it's a good embodiment to incorporate your 
spirituality, your spiritual life, with your carnal life. 
Christine Lewis: 
Beautiful. Any last words? Anything you want to put out there? What is your 
parting words? [01:33:00] What would My Rosie say?

Rosemarie Primo: 
There is so much on my repertoire but I like this phrase from the Psalms David. 
[01:33:30] Psalm 91, that states, "He shall bring forth fruits in full season and 
they shall be fat and nourishing. He shall bring fruits in all age ..." I subject to 
correct, let me say it over again. "He shall bring forth fruits in all age and they 
shall be fat and nourishing," [01:34:00] which surmises me. In my old age, I want 
to be remembered, not so much by the carnal, worldly things, but my spiritual 
work with the nation. That's my parting words.
