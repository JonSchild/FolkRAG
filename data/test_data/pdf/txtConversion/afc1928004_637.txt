specialty, Character and Swell Singing, to the highest 
degree of perfection, avoiding vulgarity, or any word or 
phrase that would bring a

do, that originality and 
refinement in comic singing will be appreciated.

HOW IS YOUR SISTER MARY? 
-:

A 
comic song, adapted and sung by the celebrated comic vocalist, 
CHAS. H . 
DUNCAN. 
— 
0 
:— 
Can you tell why men are contrary; 
Why is it that every young elf, 
Will fancy my fat sister Mary, 
And leave Jane to fancy herself? 
Should I 
meet with Torn, Dick or Harry, 
No matter how pressing the task, 
They manage a 
moment to tarry, 
And surely ' tis simply to ask: 
CHORUS. 
How is your sister Mary; 
I 
hope her health is fair; 
How is her pet canary; 
Does she still dye her hair? 
Last night we were set in a 
flutter 
By rappings we ne'er heard before, 
But Mary's too utterly utter 
To answer a 
knock at the door. 
Jane flew through the hall in a 
hurry, 
Queer notions were crowding her head, 
She opened the door in a 
flurry 
When a 
la-de-da fellow he said: 
I 
last week went out promenading 
And met such a 
stylish young girl, 
I 
knew she was out la-de-da-ing 
Because of her too " too too" whirl. 
She approached me so graceful and lightly, 
Her curling nice hair it was red, 
She waved her hand, oh, so politely, 
And whispering softly she said; 
(Spoken.)

The Isle That's Crowned With Shamrock 
—:0:-----
Sang to great applause all over America by the refined and excel-
lent Motto and Swell Comic Vocalist, CHAS. H . 
DUNCAN. 
France has got the Fleur-de-lis, 
And England's got the Rose; 
And Scotland for her Ensign, 
The Heather Thistle shows. 
But Ireland's got the Shamrock, 
In all her valley's seen; 
And ever wears upon her breast, 
The triple leaf of green. 
CHORUS: 
Then Irishmen remember, 
Wherever you may roam; 
The Isle that's crowned with Shamrock, 
Is still your native home. ( Repeat). 
On many a 
foreign battle-field, 
It cheered the Irish boy; 
And won the brighest laurels, 
• At glorious Fontenoy. 
Go where you will, from pole to pole, 
Where'er the Celt may be: 
You'll find he loves that dear old Isle, 
That sparkles in the sea.

Coney Island Down the Bay. 
COMIC SONG AND CHORUS. 
Written and sung to great applause by CHARLES H. DuNcAN. 
Music published by GEO. D . 
NEWHALL, Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Price 40 cents. 
One summer's morn I 
went for a 
sail to Coney Island, 
As through the bay we steamed away a 
charming girl I 
spied, 
Loving glances she sent, the weary hours beguiling, 
She ate clam soup and caught the croup while floating with 
the tide. 
CHORUS. 
She sang so nice and sweetly that lovely summer's day, 
I'm glad I 
went, it was pleasantly spent at Coney Island 
down the bay. (Repeat.) 
When we landed at the Isle she quickly took my arm, 
We chatted and talked as on we walked toward the crowded 
beach, 
Would she bathe ? yes, with a 
smile, she thought 'twould do 
no harm, 
She looked so cute in a 
bathing suit, I 
stuck to her like a 
leech. 
She sang so nice, & c. 
She battled with he surf and then played with the water, 
She grabbed the rope and tried to float, but got ducked for 
her pains. 
While dining at the Brighton, a 
tall man he did halt her, 
He called her wife, then grabbed a 
knife, and spoiled our 
little games. 
SPOKEN.—Imagine my position, taking a 
girl in bathing, 
buying her pretzels, beer, and other costly refreshments like 
that, then have a 
tall man step up and say, " It seems to me 
you're making yourself rather fresh with my wife." 
Still I 
can't forget that— 
She sang so nice, &c.

Close the Blinds Gently, do Dear. 
COMIC SONG AND CHORUS. 
Written and sung with great success by CHARLES H . 
D UNCAN. 
Set to music by J. Q. H OYT, JR. 
• 
I've a 
lady acquaintance, her name is McGee, 
She lives on the east side of town, 
As fair a 
young creature as e'er you did see, 
Her family's one of renown. 
I 
called to see her a 
short time ago, 
Her affections to win I 
did try, 
When I 
begged that she'd give me one sweet little kiss, 
The darling made me this reply: 
CHORUS. 
Close the blinds gently, do, dear, 
Close the blinds gently, do, dear; 
Oh the neighbors are queer, 
I 
trust you will hear, 
So close the blinds gently, do, dear. 
She wears her hair very peculiar indeed, 
In a 
knot on the top of her head; 
She declared no man ever could fool her and vow'd 
That no giddy man would she wed. 
She curled up her lip like a 
duchess at court, 
When my arm it encircled her waist, 
And yelled with a 
terrible falsetto voice 
As her sweet ruby lips I 
did taste— 
Close the blinds, & c. 
A silence came o'er us, a 
shrill voice was heard, 
" 
Matilda!" it yelled, " Ten o'clock!" 
I 
grabbed coat and hat, then I 
rushed for the door, 
But oh I 
received such a 
shock. 
I 
met her last Sunday, we're married, and now 
Together through life we will glide ; 
But the very first night, when I 
put out the light, 
Charlie, my darling, she cried— 
Close the blinds, & c.

Down by the Old Water Mill. 
COMIC SONG AND CHORUS. 
Written, composed and sung by CHAS. H. 
D UNCAN, the hit of the season 
at the Metropolitan Theatre, Louisville, Ky. 
Music copyrighted and published by R. A. SAALFIELD, 839 B'way, N. V. 
Some think that life the most jolly 
Is found in a 
smoky town, 
But give me the glorious country; 
Where one can get healthy and brown. 
I 
like it now better than ever, 
I'll tell you the reason why— 
If you think I'm blind, perhaps I 
am, 
For I've got a 
sweet girl in my eye. 
CHORUS. 
Down, down by the old water mill, 
Close by the side oi a 
rippling rill, 
In a 
dear little cottage just under the hill, 
That's where I 
met with my darling. 
• 
She showed me the ducks and the drakes, 
She showed me the cocks and the hens, 
She showed me the shovels and rakes, 
And the dear little ba's in their pens. 
She showed me the birds and the bees, 
And likewise the pigs and the sows, 
She showed me the butter and cheese, 
And also the bulls and thc cows. 
Down, down, &c. 
The ducks they would waddle to greet her, 
The geese made a 
terrible row, 
The cocks and the hens raced to meet her, 
And merrily grunted the sow. 
She feeds them from out of her apron. 
Her kindness to all never fails, 
Whenever she passes a 
bull or a 
cow 
They're sure to waggle their tails. 
Down, down, &c.

Don't Blame nip for I 
Didn't Do it, 
COMIC SONG AND CHORUS. 
Written, composed and sung by CHAS. H . 
D UNCAN. 
Published in sheet music by R. A. SAALFIELD, 839 Broadway, N. 
Some time ago, as you must know, 
I 
met a 
charming girl, 
She looked so very pretty 
That my brain got in a 
whirl. 
She wore a 
small shell bonnet, 
That became her well indeed, 
But when she slipped down on the ice, 
My heart for her did bleed. 
CHORUS. 
Don't blame me for I 
didn't do it, 
Don't blame me for I 
didn't d.) it, 
Don't blame me for I 
didn't do it, 
I 
am not to blame. 
She begged that I'd excuse her, 
Which of course I 
quickly done, 
She handed me a 
scented card, 
The charmer I 
had won, 
She stated that her father was 
A 
very peculiar man, 
Was training for a 
prize fight, 
And his name was Reckless Dan. 
[Repeat, 
Don't blame me, &c. 
I 
stuck to her just like a 
leech, 
We're married most a 
year, 
On good terms with her father, 
And have nothing now to fear. 
We've got a 
baby, it's a 
girl, 
She is her mother's joy, 
But I'm not fond of girls at ail— 
I'd rather have a 
boy. 
Don't blame me. &c.

Johanna Louisa McGuire. 
IRISH COMIC SONG. 
Written and sung with great success by CHARLES H. 
DUNCAN. 
Published by GEO. D. 
NEWHALL, Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Price 40 cents. 
There's a 
girl of high degree upon whom I 
am awfully stuck, 
She dances in the ballet, while her father drives a 
truck ; 
Her mother she peddles lemonade, her brother he slings hash, 
Yet the neighbors say most every day, Johanna's on the mash. 
CHORUS. 
Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Is a 
girl that you all could admire 
She's a 
voice like a 
bell, 
Though I 
never could tell 
Where she got it or how, 
Yet you all do allow 
That Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Has something that you all would desire, 
For she's awfully gay on St. Patrick's day, 
Is Johanna Louisa McGuire. 
She inhabits a 
little sky parlor up an alley where everything's 
snug, 
er furniture's very antique, a 
table, three chairs and a 
jug. 
I 
One evening at the window sat as her invited guest. 
From the alley below some young devil did throw a 
cud of 
Jackson's best. 
SPOKEN.— It 
struck the girl bang in the eye, the old yellow 
Jack molasses tobacco. 
I 
was about to sympathize with her, 
when one of those young devils yelled— 
Johanna Louisa McGuire, Sze.

PETERS, 599 Broadway, New York. 
As sung by ALICE BENN.ETT. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead, 
Whom we loved so dear— 
Like a 
dream his spirit fled 
From our home, now sad and drear; 
When the spring-time flowers were blooming, 
And the happy birds sung sweet, 
Angels called him to their home, 
Up in Heaven where we shall meet. 
CHORDS. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead 
Hope with him has fled 
From our home, now sad and ion') , 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead; 
Gone in childhood's bloom— 
rillow'd now his little head 
In the cold and silent tomb. 
O'er his grave the daisies blossom, 
Where his little form is laid; 
And the murm'ring streamlet plays 
'Neath the willow's quiet shade. 
Close the shutters, elm 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead; 
Death has claimed him now; 
Never more his smile will shed 
Sunshine on poor mother's brow. 
She is almost broken-hearted, 
And our home is sad to-day; 
Life has lost its nope and joy, 
Since our Willie's gone away. 
,Close the shutters, Icc.

I'm Waltzingham McSweeney, 
A man well known to fame, 
I'm a 
shining light at all the clubs, 
I'm a 
man of pluck and game. 
I'm the best known man on Broadway, 
On account of my form and face, 
And the stylish way I 
carry myself, 
With a 
walk of air and grace, 
I'm the one you can't help notice, 
Pm a 
man of splendid parts, 
I've a 
high-born education, 
I'm decomplished in all the arts 
I 
can swim like Captain Boynton, 
I 
can walk a 
Highland fling, 
I

boat with Hanlon, 
I'm a 
crack shot on the wing.

CHORUS. 
Waltzingham McSweeney, 
That's the cognomen I 
bear, 
The ladies admire my pretty shape 
And aristocratic air, 
The swells they all get jealous, 
When the dashing girls at me lear, 
For my graceful glide in the ball-room, 
I'm called the gay cavalier. 
I'm a 
great pedestrian walker, 
My record dates far back, 
I'd be sure to beat O'Leary, 
If they'd let me on the track, 
I'm known at all the races, 
My bets are all the boast, 
I 
can always name the winning horse, 
Before he leaves the post, 
All politicians seem to know me, 
They shake my hand with pride, 
.For they know my great influence 
In elections turn the tide. 
All the Congressmen and Senators, 
Admire me everywhere, 
And Waltzingham McSweeney, 
Some say will be your Mayor.

COLLEGE DAY'S. 
Words by EDWARD HARRIMAN. 
Music by G. W. H. GRIFFIN. 
Sung iv EDWARD HARRIGAN'S great play of " Old Lavencfer.” 
Oh, many moons have passed and gone, 
Since first I 
went to school, 
At Harvard, dear old Harvard, friends, 
I 
learned the Golden Rule; 
My classmates scattered here and there, 
All trod their different ways, 
I 
love to think and ponder o'er 
My youthful college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
I 
remember when a 
Freshman there, 
My age just twenty-four, 
In the Yale and Harvard race, my friends, 
I 
always rowed stroke oar,i, 
Our colors—handsome scarlet bright— 
First led the van always, 
Admired by the ladies all, 
Was I 
in college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Oh, the day when I 
did graduate, 
I 
was my parents pride, 
Fitted for the bar or bench, 
A 
linguist, too, beside; 
Socially I'd always meet 
My colleagues bright and gay, 
And toss a 
merry social glass, 
To our commencement day. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Culture and intelligence, 
Are qualities quite fine, 
They help constitute the gentleman, 
In every worldly clime; 
You may crush them down unto the ground, 
With poverty's cold ways, 
They'll rise again, assert their claims, 
As taught in college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
THE TRAMP. 
15 
Written and sung by BEN COTTON, JR. 
A. poor fellow am I, 
I'm what you call a 
tramp 
Daily I 
trudge along the street ; 
My feet are very sore, 
My clothes they are all tore, 
No one seems to know me, for I'm down! 
Once I'd money plenty, 
And friends too, by the score ! 
But they have all passed away ; 
If I 
meet them on the street, 
They call me Beggar, and a 
Beat— 
And do not seem to know me, for I'm down! 
CHORUS. 
Now, remember what I 
say, 
Your wealth may pass away ; 
And perhaps you will be forced to beg— 
Then your friends will pass you by— 
With scorn in their eye ; 
And will not recognize you, for you're down 
I'm weary and footsore, 
I'm hungry and weak; 
I 
have got no place to lay my head, 
Except in a 
wagon, in the street ! 
Then some Policeman on his Beat, 
Will drive me out, saying, that's no place to sleep ; 
And so I 
trudge along, 
And pass many a 
happy throng 
Of people a 
walking on the street ; 
Looking at me, they've lots of fun, 
Saying, oh ain't he a 
Bum 
Ain't he a 
wreck ! you bet he's broken down ! 
Now, remember, ke.

The Tar's Farewell. 
Sung by EDWIN BARRY. 
When forced to bid farewell to Loo, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away, 
I 
did not know what I 
should do, 
Pull away, pull away. 
I 
left her weeping on the quay, 
She said she would be true to me, 
As we sailed away to the Southern sea ; 
Pull away, my boys, pull away. 
CHORUS. 
For the wind must blow, and the ship must go, 
And loving souls must part, 
For the ship will tack, and the tar come back 
To the first love of his heart. 
(Repeaz,} 
But then, if false should prove my fair, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away, 
I'd burn this little lock of hair, 
Pull away, pull away. 
If she be false and I 
be free, 
I'll sail again to the Southern sea, 
Where there are plenty as good as she, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away. 
For the wind must blow, &c. 
THE TWO IRISH BOYS. 
Music can be had at " Bruns & Kaufmann," 791 Broadway, near lath 
Street. 
Written by M URPHY 8‘, M ILES, whose new Songs and 
Dances never fail to please. 
Oh, here we are from Ireland. 
As you can plainly see; 
We took a 
trip on a 
great big ship, 
To sail to America. 
We landed at Castle Garden, 
Sure three weeks ago to-day; 
We'll drink suecess to the Irish boys, 
That's in old Ireland. 
CHORIJS. 
Oh, yes we are two Irish boys, 
That came across the sea; 
For singing or for dancing, 
I 
think that we'll please ye. 
We landed at Castle Garden, 
Sure three weeks ago to-day; 
We'll drink success to the Irish boys, 
That's in old Ireland. 
When we landed in America, 
Sure we hadn't no place to go; 
We had no friends to harbor us, 
We didn't know what to do. 
We wandered along through Broadway, 
When a 
man took us by the hand; 
Says he, my boys, I 
can tell by your face, 
Your from old Ireland. 
(Chorus).

Our club is always noted for its larking and sparkin' 
Such dancin' and singin' and jolly sport have we; 
Our picnics bate them all without denial, a

Would set you wild with pleasure at the Twilight Coterie. 
It's dance and prance, and catch the motion easy, 
And in a 
whirl, swing your girl, now we're off in style 
you see. 
And still the fiddle and the 
boundin' 
Are all the merry spielers of 
horns are soundin' while 
the Twilight Coterie. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's on a 
summer's night in the park, my boys, 
Where the merry girls are singin' light and free, 
Hands around and round, and round, oh! what a 
lark, my 
boys, 
How the spielers prance, at the moonlight dance, of the 
Twilight Coterie. 
There's honored delegations from . the " Starlights" and 
"Skylights," 
The " Ours" and " Yours" and other coteries, 
Together with their friends and their ladies, the daisies, 
Invited guest whose hearts are blessed with all the beer 
they please; 
It's skip and dip, and sachez round in glory, 
Oh, Kate asthorel bang the floor, that's the style of girl 
for me, 
And so around we balance, and each daisy is crazy 
Wid great hilarity, all at the Twilight Coterie. 
(Chorus.)

MY HEART IS BENT UPON A SAILOR. 
BY EDWARD HARRIGAN. 
Oh, I 
love to see the ships 
Sail in from foreign trips, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
mermaid in the water, 
Or else a 
little pearl, 
Or the darling little girl 
That the sailors call jolly neptune's daughter. 
Then when a 
ship would wreck 
I 
would jump upon the deck, 
Or through a 
golden horn I 
would hail her; 
I 
pick out from the crew 
Some jolly tar in blue, 
For my heart is 
fways on a 
sailor. 
I'd be as constant as the dove 
To my bonny own true love, 
If he left me the seas to go a 
roamin'; 
I 
would dream at night of him, 
Aloft in a 
gale of wind 
You'd never catch me sighing or a 
moaning. 
Saying " I'll meet my darling boy 
With his jolly ship ahoy; 
Who'd be a 
lawyer or a 
tailor, 
I 
never will get wed 
Unless my husband tread 
The deck of a 
vessel as a 
sailor.

Prier

Oh! we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er, 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future evermore, 
Our once tender love is buried in tne past 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would Pall, 
In spite of all that I 
could do, 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again. 
CHORUS. 
?Ay dream of love is o'er, 
I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain; 
But the memory of the past comes up before 
Me like a 
dream, for the darling one I 
ne'er shall awl 
again. 
Ohl they say you love another, . 
Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget; 
All the vows we pledged together, 
By the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my pet. 
Ahl the heart is like the tides, 
That flow and ebb at will, 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could; 
So, thro' all the future years, 
I'll love thee fondly, dearly, darling! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would. 
My dream of love is o'er . lc

MY ELDEST DAUGHTER CLARA,

Written by James Richmond for Pat Rooney and suet% 
by him with great success. 
• 
Sure I 
have a 
lovely daughter, 
On the stage she cuts a 
dash, 
She wears blonde wigs and powders her face, 
To try and catch a 
mash. 
She can dance a 
tailor's hornpipe, 
She tells the old woman that she is fine, 
She wears flesh colored pants when sh.: comes 
out to dance, 
And gets drunk on German wine. 
CHORUS. 
She wears dizzy diamonds and wings on her back, [break 
in the ballet dance she is like a 
jumping jack, [break. 
She has a 
barrel of paint on her face, 
Like a 
fairy from Conamarra, 
The pride of the McCormick family, 
Is my eldest daughter Clara. 
• 
You should see her in the can-can, 
She is the dead picture of her ma, 
She has a 
foot as big as a 
telegraph pole, 
Her features are like her pa. 
She has all the swells near crazy, 
An engagement for life she has signed, 
She is hitched to a 
man named Freddie McCan, 
He has a 
million dollars in his mind.

In all the festive glory 
Of gay flags and banners bright 
The merry picnic barge is drifting, 
Thro' the starry night ; 
And borne across the waters 
Come sounds of music sweet, 
And merry laugh, and joyous shout 
And pat of tripping feet, oh! 
CHORUS. 
On the picnic barge they dance, 
In the moonlight, soft they dance, 
Down the river gliding free, 
To rich music's melody ; 
'Round the deck the merry feet, 
In a 
jolly measure beat, 
Whirl and glide, as down with the tide, 
On the barge they lightly dance. 
A 
vision of rare beauty, 
Floating gently down the stream, 
Thro' plashing waters silvered 
By each brilliant moonlight beam. 
A time for joy and pleasure, 
For merry dance and song, 
A time to tell love's sweetest story, 
While we drift along.

'Twas a 
beautiful day but a 
short time ago, 
I 
met a 
young friend named McKay; 
Says he if you'll come, we'll have lots of fun, 
At our picnic that's-going down the bay; 
I 
refused first to go, but he'd not accept no, 
On my going he insisted quite hearty; 
Saying please come along, you can sing us a 
song, 
And help entertain our small party. 
CHORUS: 
Dancing with the girls and boys, 
Schottische, and waltzing so gay; 
I 
danced so much I 
was really tired, 
At the picnic down the bay. 
The gents were all dressed in suits of the best, 
And the ladies looked happy and light; 
As the boat left the pier, we loudly did cheer, 
It was really a 
beautiful sight; 
Both the old and young had plenty of fun, 
To hear the girls laughing and singing; 
Our joy to enhance, we'd each other outdance, 
While the band its sweet music kept ringing.

Our name is Pat and Kittle Car, 
From Castle Bar we came; 
Two Irish dancers sure we are, 
And for it we've gained great fame; 
The boys and girls when work was done, 
They would come from near and far; 
All bent on dancii,g reels and jigs, 
With the pair from Castle Bar. 
CHORUS: 
At a 
jig or a 
reel on toe or heel, 
We're unequaled near or far; 
Arrah by night or day there's none so gay 
As the pair from Castle Bar. 
Of champion dancers we've a 
lot, 
Who dance with clogs or skates; 
Prize belts and silver medals 
They have got on their breasts as large as plates. 
When eh 
comes on the stage to dance, 
Sure he thinks himself a 
star; 
With their fancy touches they stand no chance 
With the pair from Castle Bar.

LIFE is full of toil and trouble; 
Care and sorrow hover near; 
Gloomy thoughts by day oppress us, 
All our nights are pass'd in fear. 
Still a 
brighter day is coming, 
But tow'rd earth our heads are bow'd, 
And we cannot see the sunlight, 
Hid, just now, behind a 
cloud.. 
CHORUS. 
Laugh at fate and scorn her arrows, 
Ne'er be by misfortune cowed; 
You can see, by gazing upward, 
Sunlight hid behind a 
cloud. 
Laugh at fate and scorn her arrows, 
Ne'er be by misfortune cowed; 
You can see, by gazing upward, 
Sunlight hid behind a 
cloud. 
Ne'er despair, tho' life seem weary, 
All the bitter cup must quaff; 
Weeping will not mend the matter, 
Better far at care to laugh. 
Life's a 
farce in which your acting. 
Should be careless, gay and proud, 
Like to his who sees the sunlight, 
E'en tho' hid behind a 
cloud. 
Laugh at fate, etc. 
Laugh with scorn an 
d 
defiance 
To the ills that life can bring; 
Trouble flees when met undaunted, 
Grief is robbed of half its sting. 
Firmly stand, erect and manly, 
Bend not like the pliant crowd, 
Light will beam in time upon you, 
Litho' now hid behind a 
cloud.

Will you Hearken to my Footsteps'? 
Sung by FRED. It RALPH, of BAIRD'S M INSTRELS, 
0:-
Will you hearken for my footsteps?. 
Call me now, my darling, to thee; 
While the purple shades of twilight, 
And the stars in beauty we see; 
Will you gladly wait my coming, 
At the hour of the day's decline; 
When I 
hasten o'er the meadow, 
Will you whisper darling " I 
am thine?. 
CHORUS: 
Will you hearken for my footsteps, 
When the stars of evening are bright; 
And the calm, pale moon is shining, 
Through the purple shadows of night? 
Will you hearken for my footsteps, 
When the night is blissful -
and fair; 
'Neath the lovely stars I 
am waiting, 
Will you come and welcome me there? 
Will you whisper words as loving, 
As the sweet vow you pledged before; 
While I'm waiting in the gloaming, 
Will you answer kindly once more?

Sweet visions of childhood, how bright they appear 
When our lives are o'erclouded with care; 
How fondly we dream of them year after year, 
And how lovely they are and how fair. 
Oh, bless'd are the scenes I 
ne'er can forget: 
Dearest mother so kind and so true; 
Sweet home that I 
left with the saddest regret, 
How my heart fondly turns unto you. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet visions of childhood return to me now, 
And I 
weep for the days that are past; 
My fond mother's kiss and her hand on my brow, 
In the days that were too bright to last. 
Sweet visions of childhood, how dear to each heart, 
Once again by a 
fair mother's knee 
I 
linger while fast welling tears fondly start, 
And the past comes in beauty to me. 
Oh, time may destroy all the bright joy of life, 
But this bosom will ever retain 
Lovely visions of thee, 'mid the world's busy strile, 
Bringing bliss to this fond heart again.

Sung with immense success by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
Music of this song can be obtained from SPEAR St DEHNHOFY, 
717 Broadway, N. Y. 
I've jest arrived in town you see, to spend a 
week or two, 
But I've been so vexed since I've been here, I 
don't know what, 
to do, 
For everybody says to me no 'Latter where I 
be, 
And whatever I 
am doing this is what they say to me, 
CHORUS. 
At it again, at it again, 
You rascal I'm looking your at it again, 
You're a 
naughty young man, I 
see very plain, 
You rascal I'm looking, your at it again. 
I 
took a 
cab when I 
arrived, and drove at once up town, 
And because I'd not pay double fare the "cabby" then did frown. 
He said he'd take me to the Mayor, and of me he'd complain, 
Then the crowd said I 
was cheating, and cried out " you're at 
it again." 
At it again, etc. 
I 
paid him then to go away, and sneaked off very soon, 
And being as it were upset, I 
entered a 
saloon, 
I 
drank three brandies right clean off to ease my troubled brain 
When a 
youngster poked his head in the door, and cried out 
" 
you're at it again." 
At it again, etc. 
When evening camel took a 
stroll, the sights in town to see, 
And I 
met a 
lovely creature, who seemed pleased at meeting 
m 
e. 
We 
walked awhile, and bye- and-bye, in a 
restaurant we went, 
Arid in a 
cozy little supper room, we soon were quite content. 
Spoken.—We had a 
nice supper together, and after supper, I 
asked the young lady for a 
kiss, and just as she got her dear 
little mouth all puckered up for that delightful sensation, the

A SMILE WAS ALL .1;.1_11._: GAVE ME. 
Written and sung by Bobby Newcomb. 
Not long ago, I 
was the beau 
Of a 
pretty girl, named Mary; 
With a 
face so sweet, and a 
style so neat 
And a 
step just like a 
fairy. 
We courted long, our love was strong: 
How I 
wished that she would have me! 
But when I 
did the question pop: 
A 
smile was all he gave me. 
CHORUS. 
And she was so fair, I 
do declare, 
How I 
wished that she would have tiler 
But when I 
did the question pop:. 
A 
smile was all she gave me. 
I 
sent her notes, I 
sent her dowers, 
I 
took her out a- riding: 
tIow quick time flies when love and sighs 
Are with the hours gliding! 
A 
rival was my only fear : 
And I 
couldn't think, to save mc, 
That when I 
asked her who he Was, 
A 
smile was all she gave me. 
Cheru.s.. 
At last, a 
note, I 
got one day, 
And dreadful news it carried, 
Inviting me to come and see— 
Herself and rival married! 
Now off I 
went, on death was bent, 
Resolved that none should save me— 
But I 
am not dead, though she got wed, 
And a 
smile was all she gave me.

Good evening to you all,

I'm leader of the style, 
That's plain enough to see, 
So if you want the fashion, 
Get pinned back just like me. 
CHORUS. 
All pinned back I 
all pinned back! 
It's the style, you see; 
All pinned back all pinned back! 
That's the style for me. 
Some people don't like it, 
And say you cannot walk, 
While dressed in a 
pinned-back, 
But that is foolish talk; 
They are only jealous, 
And to that you agree, 
So if you like the fashion, 
Get pinned back just like me.

AIN'T YOU GOT A CHEEK. 
i)y ROBERT M CKAY. 
sung 
TotcY PASTOR. 
Oh, I 
love a 
maiden, she's fair as can be, 
Her hair is nut brown and her boot No. 3, 
her cheeks are as red as the blossoming rose, 
Joy follows her footsteps wherever she goes, 
In her is all happiness earth can bestow, 
I 
can't understand why she teases me so, 
For when I 
would kiss her, this sly little puss, 
On ter lips puts her finger and answers me- thus— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, ain't you naughty, to talk to me so, 
No, I 
won't let you, now please let me go, 
I'll be " mad" and to you I'll never speak, 
You're " horrid," you're " awful," ain't you got 
a 
cheek! 
It's awful, when for a 
caress you're inclined, 
A maiden should act so unjust and unkind, 
This motive alone she can have I 
am sure, 
The cower received will be valued the more, 
And thus they're so artful and cunning the elves, 
When we know they would " like to" as well as 
ourselves, 
And so I'm perplexed and the point I 
can't see, 
When covered with blushes she cries out to me— 
Cnouus.—Oh, ain't you naughty, to talk to me so, etc. 
Some day we'll be married, Oh, thrice happy day 
Then all affectation will be cast away, 
Then I 
shall enfold her in these loving arms, 
And shield her forever from earth's wild alarms, 
Joy, joy then shall reign in this bosom supreme, 
Life then will be real, not a 
delusive dream, 
I'll kiss her, caress her, do just as I 
please, 
And will not be amazed by such words as these— 
CHORLS.—Oh, ain't you naughty, to talk to meso, etc.

I'm a 
dacent Irish woman, Ann O'Hoolahan is my name, 
And I've a 
daughter, a 
big street- walker, and Mary.is her 
name; 
She wears a 
big waterfall, she calls it a 
catcher in her slang, 
She been out all night with that blackguard Terry that lately 
joinecIthe gang. 
CHORUS. 
She comes creeping up stairs at 3 
P. X., 
With her hat and shoes in her hand, 
She's been out all night to a 
Pic-nic Park 
With Terry that joined the gang. 
When she came home last Tuesday night, oh, this is what I 
said: 
" 
Mary Ann, my dear, you're doing very wrong," when she 
says, 
Go soak your head." 
The old man hit her with a 
great big stick, knocked her hat 
into the frying-pan; 
She's been out all night with that blackguard Terry, the fellow 
that joined the gang. 
She comes creeping, &c. 
She got up last Monday morning and put on all her good 
clothes; 
I 
says, " Mary Ann, where are you going?" when at me she 
stuck up her nose. 
She stands upon the corner, you should see her, yes, you 
should, 
I'll bet she's up with Terry and the gang, a 
spieling at Jones' 
Wood. 
She comes creeping, &c.

THE COMMERCIAL DRUMMER. 
As represented in Mr. Curtis' great play of " Samuel of Posen,'' 
Published by permission of and copyrighted, 1881. by `• Bruns 
& Kaufmann," N. Y. The great sensation of the seasan. 
Price, Words and Music, 40 cents. 
The happiest man you ever met, 
Is the drummer on the road; 
- 
His words are gay to all you bet, 
In spinning yarns he's great; 
He sweetly smiles " Good day, Sir," 
And offers a 
cigar, 
But when that part is over, oh, 
Then begins the war. 
C.'orqm..—Machshovis he has plenty, 
And lots of stuff that's bad; 
But if you speak against his goods, 
Oh don't he then get mad. 
He travels east, north, south and west, 
In weather bad or fair; 
The smoking car he likes the best, 
For there he's free from care; 
He sells his goods, enjoys himself, 
And takes in every town, 
And if he's caught in telling fibs, 
He's sure to laugh it down. 
Suspenders gay and garters bright, 
And collars large and small; 
And other goods of many styles, 
To suit the short and tall; 
A " halven " dollar he calls cheap, 
When an offer he does make, 
But if a " quavdter " you should bid, 
The bid he's sure to take 
He dresses well and with good taste, 
Is always on the mash; 
And socially he is " immense," 
As the firm puts up the cash; 
In every town he has a 
girl, 
With whoth he's dead in love, 
And taffy by the barrel he gives, 
This charming turtle dove.

With knapsacks full we'll march along,

We will soon be in Jerusalem 
When we're past Jericho. 
When we come to the Holy Land 
And we've got Palestine,

With green shutters painted white; 
There's a 
family of cats lives in the rear, 
They play " Pinafore " every night. 
They sing something about Maria, 
And the times are very hard; 
Oh, they'll chew tobacco and spit ill your eye, 
The cats in our back yard. 
CHORUS.

They have walking matches an the fence, 
Have picnics in the cellar; 
I

You ought to hear them beller. 
They sing alto, base, and tenor, 
Oh, they ought to be feathered and tarred! 
Oh, they are worse than Haverley's Minstrels, 
Yes, the cats in our back yard.

GOD BLESS OUR DEAR OLD FLAG. 
Dedicated to my esteemed friend Miss C. 
E. 
DE 
SHEPPARD, 
with best wishes. 
Original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS, at 
the New National Theatre, Philadelphia. 
IN this glorious land of freedom, exciting times have been, 
I 
often picture in my mind, each great and stirring scene. 
I 
never looked upon the place, where our starry flag did fly, 
But the great events of by-gone days, to picture them I'd try. 
'Twas a 
noble sight at Yorktown, when Washington did stand, 
And took the sword from that great lord, who did invade our 
native land. 
He tried his best to win the fight, and low our banner drag, 
But the Yankee boys rose in their might, and saved our deaf 
old flag. 
Again when shot and shell they flew, like hailstones thick and 
fast, 
A 
gallant youth he braved them all, as he clung to the mast. 
He seized our country's emblem, which had been shot away, 
And waved it in the foeman's face, way down in Mobile bay, 
A Yankee cheer it then went up, in triumph from our fleet, 
And soon the enemy gave way, defeated, cowed and beat. 
The boy descended to the deck, of Farragut we brag, 
And every brave tar with joy cried out, " God bless our dear 
own old flag." 
Again when trouble came us o'er, and darkest was the hew., 
A 
noble general staunch and brave, he proved his mighty power. 
He stood upon the battle plain, as thousands did him fight, 
his emblem was our Stars and Stripes, his motto " Truth and 
Right." 
Though treated bad by friends at home, he scorned the fight to 
yield, 
He swore he'd win the victory, or perish on the field. 
He led his columns manfully, repelled each fierce attack, 
The battle was Antietam boys, the hero, Little Mac. 
And when the great Centennial came, each nation in this world, 
Did bless our glittering emblem, when its bunting wasc\furl'd. 
They came from Asia's sandy plains, from Afric's burninrclime, 
From far Australia's lonely wilds, from Europe's sunny Rhine. 
They came to see the poor man's home, where the Sun sinks in 
the West, 
Where every wanderer finds a 
bed, and is with plenty blest. 
And when our banner bright went up, no tyrants flaunting rag, 
The nations all with joy theyr,ied, God bless that dear old flag I

GEM OF THE EMERALD ISLE. 
ords and Music by PAT FEENEY, and dedicated and sung by 
JOHN W ALSH, the Great Irish Vocalist, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, N. Y. 
I'll sing now in praise of the gem of old Ireland, 
Whose names are respected by friend and by foe; 
Of the men who proud to acknowledge their sireland, 
Of men who gained fame by word and by blow; 
Their hearts brave and true, never knew any danger, 
As cheerfully they for their country did toil; 
it must be acknowledged by friend and by stranger, 
That they were bright gems from the Emeral Isle. 
First is Brian Borue, the great King whose example 
If followed by Monarchs of this present day; 
A 
blessing would prove, for his wisdom was ample, 
lie knew how to rule in a 
true Kingly way; 
Brave Patrick Sarsfield, exiled from his sireland, 
Exclaimed as he died on a 
foreigner's soil; 
Oh, may heaven grant freedom for old Ireland, 
Then died a 
bright gem of the Emerald Isle. 
if we boast of our gems, surely no one can blame 
When we've produced men like those I 
will name; 
Balfe Wallace and Tom Moore who made themselves, 
famous, 
With music and poetry they gained their fame; 
There's Sherridan, Goldsmith and Swift, three more 
great men, 
What nation on earth ever equaled their styl,, 
There's Davitt, Daily and Killen, three more great 
Statesmen, 
All these are bright gems of the Emerald Isle.

CUMBERLAND'S CREW. 
Sung with great success by Devlin & Tracy. 
! 
shipmates, come, gather and join in my ditty, 
It's of a 
terrible battle that happened of late; 
Let each good Union-Tar shed a 
sad tear of pity, 
When he thinks of the once gallant Cumberland's fate. 
The eighth day of March told a 
terrible story, 
And many a 
brave tar to this world bid Adieu! 
Vet our Flag it was wrapt in a 
mantle of glory, 
By the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's crew. 
On that ill-fated day about ten in the morning, 
The sky it was clear, and bright shone the sun; 
The drums of the Cumberland sounded a 
warning 
That told every seaman to stand by his gun. 
An Iron-clad Frigate down on us came bearing, 
And high in the air the Rebel Flag flew; 
The Pennant of Treason she proudly was waving, 
Determined to conquer the Cumberland's crew. 
Then up spoke our Captain with stern resolution, 
Saying: my boys, of this monster now don't be dismayed 
We swore to maintain our beloved Constitution, 
And to die for our country we are not afraid! 
We fight for the Union, our cause it is glorious, 
To the Stars and Stripes we will stand ever true ; 
We'll sink at our quarters, or conquer victorious! 
\Vas answered,with cheers,from the Cumberland's creNk 
Now our gallant ship fired her guns' dreadful thunder, 
Her broad-side, like hail, on the Rebel did pour. 
The people gazed on, struck with terror and wonder, 
The shots struck her sides and glanced harmless o'er; 
CUMBERLAND'S CREW.—Continued. 
• 
But the pride of our Navy could never be daunted, 
• 
Tho' the dead and the wounded her deck they did strew; 
And the Flag of the Union, how proudly it flaunted, 
Sustained by the blood of the Cumberland's crew. 
Slowly they sunk beneath Virginia's waters, 
Their voices on earth will ne'er be heard more— 
They'll be wept by Columbia's brave sons and fair daughters 
May their blood be avenged on Virginia's shore 
In that battle stained grave they are silently lying— 
Their souls have forever to earth bid Adieu !— 
But the Star-Spangled Banner above them is flying, 
It was nailed to the mast by the Cumberland's crew. 
They fought us three hours, with stern resolution, 
Till those Rebels found cannon would never avail them -
For the Flag of Secession has no power to gall them, 
Tho' the blood from their scuppers it crimsoned the tide; 
She struck us amid- ship, our planks she did sever, 
Her sharp iron-prong pierced our noble ship through: 
And still, as they sank on that dark rolling river, 
We'll die at our guns ! cried the Cumberland's crew. 
Columbia's sweet birth- right of Freedom's communion, 
Thy Flag never floated so proudly before; 
l''or the spirits of those that died for our Union, 
- Above its broad folds now exaltingly soar 
And when our sailors in battle assemble, 
God bless our dear Banner: the Red, White and Blue! 
Beneath its bright Stars we'll cause tyrants to tremble, 
Or sink at our guns, like the Cumberland's crew.

CRUEL DAYS BEFORE .THE WAR. 
Written by JERRY KENNEY, and sung by HARRY W OODSON, at 
Harrigan & Hart's Theatre, N. Y. 
Oh, listen to the words 
Of a 
poor old colored man, 
Whose heart am filled with misery and woe; 
And a 
story I 
will tell. 
That you all do know full well, 
Of them cruel, cruel days of long ago. 
In dear old Tennessee, 
I 
lived so happily, 
The thoughts do make my old heart fuel sore; 
When I 
think of days gone by, 
The tears come to my eyes, 
Them tyrannizing days before the war. 
C 
IT OR 
L'S. 
Them cruel days am gone, 
Let us pray both night and-morn, 
That they again may never come no more; 
In my memory it am new, 
The sufferings we went through, 
In them tyrannizing days before the war. 
I 
remember wel!, I 
know, 
It am very long ago, 
When I 
used to sit around my cabin home; 
With my children around my knee, 
They would play so merrily, 
Until that woeful bitter day did come. 
The white man came one day, 
Took my little ones away, 
Oh I 
can it be I'll never see them any more? 
It's taken then were we, 
And sold into slavery, 
In thosc tyrannizing days before the war. 
Them cruel days, etc. 
My companions are no more, 
They have gone unto that shore, 
And their journey through this life now am done; 
They will find that all am love, 
In that happy land above, 
in that bright and blessed peaceful happy home. 
But always we will pray— 
Yes, every night and day, 
That them cruel times may come no more; 
For our sufferings they were great, 
How terrible our fate, 
in those tyrannizing days before the war.

FROM our home the loved are going 
Out upon life's stormy sea, 
And our hearts itre sad in knowing 
We shall ever parted be ; 
They are seeking other pleasures 
Far across the ocean's foam, 
Finding other hearts and treasures, 
Loved ones going from our home.

From our home the loved are going 
One by one like leaves that fall ; 
Ever going, softly going, 
Far away from our recall. 
From our home the loved are going, 
Leaving us alone to sigh, 
And our eyes are dimmed with weeping, 
As we bid them all good-bye; 
Laughing eyes ami sunny faces 
From us evermore depart— 
Loving lips and warm embraces— 
How we miss them from our heart. 
From our home the loved, etc.

01HAVE you heard the news, my boys, 
That glorious news to-day; 
Those gallant sons, with pikes and guns, 
Are girding for the fray. 
The exiles are returning, 
Their dear old land to see; 
And you and me, must ready be, 
To strike for liberty. 
CHORUS. 
We'll tear that British banner down, 
And we'll every foe destroy ; 
Till we trample in the bloody dust 
Of an Irish Pontenoy. 
The green flag shall wave over us, 
As it did in days of yore; 
And the dear old harp of Tara's Hall, 
Shall strike its chords once more. 
And the tune we'll play, shall be Patrick's day 
And we'll play it o'er and o'er, 
And soon you'll see, old Ireland free, 
And the exiles home once more.

But now we'll beg no more ; 
No more like prowling hounds we'll crawl,

And soon we'll strike the blow ; 
That will raise up poor old Ireland, 
And lay the tyrant low.

It is only a

In my hand that I 
tenderly hold, 
From the one who is dearer and better

For this mark of affection to see, 
So then now there is no use denying 
I'm as happy as happy can be.

It is only a

It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
But its pages are fill'd with kind worth, 
Whose affection is dearer, yes better, 
Than sweet music or carols of birds. 
Oh, they waken glad mem'ries to cheer me, 
As I 
wander afar on life's sea, 
While the sweetest of thoughts linger near me, 
I'm as happy as happy can be. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, &c. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
But it tells of a 
heart that is true, 
Of a 
love that grows brighter and better 
As the days fade away from my view. 
Yes, it breathes of the fondest devotion, 
That will cling now and ever to me, 
And my heart in its tend'rest emotion, 
I'm as happy as happy can be.

MUSIC BY DANE BRAITAM. 
Written by ED. HARRIGAN, as sung with great success 
by him in sketch, " Terrible Exaniple." 
The snow was a 
falling, 
One cold Winter morning; 
A 
man stood a 
begging 
On a 
corner, alone. 
Policemen patrolling, 
Look'd at him scorning---
They turned a 
deaf ear 
To his piteous moan. 
In his tatter'd old rags 
He stood, wan and trembling; 
A 
poor human creature, 
With death in his eyes. 
Please give me charity--
I'm not dissembling ? 
He's only a 
vagrant, 
Oh ! let him alone. 
Alone and forsaken I 
Never complaining, 
He stood like a 
statue 
Of hard marble stone. 
The wind shrilly moaning, 
• 
AS 
if t'were condoning 
The poor sadden'd outcast 
From society thrown. 
In the world, he sighed, 
I'm a 
wreck of humanity; 
They deny me existence; 
I 
ask myself why ? 
Have I 
fallen so low, 
That e'en christianity 
Calls me a 
vagrant, 
And says—let him die! 
Unconsciously strolling, 
Toward the dark river, 
Where he watch'd the mad river 
Flowing swift on; 
He raurmux'd, I'd better 
Go back to my Giver, 
Pleading for mercy— 
I'd no right to be born. 
Since the days of my childhood, 
I've fought destitution, 
Suffered starvation, 
No sunshine e'er nigh. 
A 
whisper came to him, 
from the dark rolling water, 
You're only a 
vagrant, 
Come here and die

There Never was a 
Coward Where the Shamrock 
Grows. 
Respectfully dedicated to Fayette Welsh, and sung with great 
success by Edwin Talbot in his Parlor entertainments. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they may, 
Against the dear land of my birth; 
But I 
will maintain in spite of all foes, 
It's the dearest green spot on this earth. 
Some say we are cowards and fit for naught else 
But drinking our home-made potheen 
But I'll throw back the villainous lie in their face, 
We're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat 
got a 
temper which don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity as everybody knows. 
But there never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
Tho' oppress'd and insulted for hundreds of years 
By the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefather's had— 
For that they cannot take away. 
They kept learning from us, stole all we hold dear, 
And crushed us till others cried shame; 
But in spite of it all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same.

St. Patrick's Morn. 
57 
Written and sung with great success by H ENRY CARNEY, at Tony Pastor's 
Theatre, New York. 
There's a 
clay that comes but once a 
year—the 17th of March, 
And upon it every Irishman is drinking; 
All the girls are dressed so gay, and the pipers—how they 
play! 
And the boys at all the pretty girls are winking. 
Then we all put on the green, and we just feel all serene, 
While the shamrock in our button holes adorning; 
And every mother's son makes his mind up for some fun 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
Then shout Hurrah for Erin, the land that gave me birth, 
And the darling little shamrock don't be scorning; 
Such a 
sight ye've never seen as the wearing of the green 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
Upon St. Patrick's eve, when our daily work we leave, 
Every Irishman is frolicsome and frisky ; 
He's a 
coin or two to spend, and another for to lend, 
And at home he's got a 
stinging taste of whiskey. 
At night he goes to I 
ed feeling quare about the head, 
And he snores until the day is gently dawning ; 
Then he wakes and rubs his eyes, and then " 13edad," he cries, 
" 
It's St. Patrick's day in the morning." 
Then shout Hurrah, &c 
And when parade begins, och, it's murther for our shins, 
7 
Such hustling and bustling and squeezing; 
Then of drink there's such a 
lot, and it's always thundering 
hot, 
there's little chance of anybody freezing. 
Then the band and pipes are blowin' to the chune of " Garry 
Owen," 
For to have another chune we would be scorning • 
It's the finest bit of spree that ever you did see 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
Then shout Hurrah, &c.

There's As Dear One Waiting For Me, 
Words and Musit by J. L. 
FEENEY. Copyrighted, 1880, by 
B. W. IirrcueecK, 166 Nassau Street. 
Sung by 
MISE'KITTY COLEMAN. 
I'm far away from the home I 
love, 
And my heart is sad and forlorn; 
I 
often think of my boyhood hours, 
Also the place where I 
was born. 
But Nellie my darling: awaits my return, 
Her sweet face I'm rouging to see; 
There's a 
sighing in my heart which keeps. 
whispering, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me., 
CHORUS: 
I'll soon return to my home again, 
How happy then I 
will be; 
When I'm welcomed back by my Nellie, 
For my darling is waiting for me. 
I've traveled across the ocean wide, 
And in strange countries have I 
been; 
I've been among people of all kinds, 
But no place like home have I 
seen. 
I'm longing to be back with my little dear, 
To my home across the wide sea; 
Oh, I'm weary and sad since we parted, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
While thinking about my childhood's days, 
When I 
used to play on the green; 
How oft I've roamed with my Nellie dear, 
I 
love to recall those bright scenes. 
Remembered and cherished are those childish 
hours, 
A wander no longer I'll be; 
For my darling is waiting and watching, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me.

"ANTI-FAT TWINS." 
AS 
performed by J
OHNSON le P
OWERS, of the S
AN F
RANCISCO MIN-
STELS, with great success. 
We're full of joy and glee to-day, 
And as frisky as a 
mule; 
We heard the bell—now don't you tell— 
We ran away from school. 
Our A B 
C's we know with ease, 
And c-a-t 
spells cat; 
We are so stout we waddle about, 
And we're taking Anti-Fat. 
CHORUS: 
We float around like big balloons, 
But yet we never will complain; 
We dance and sing, and then we swing 
All day in the shady lane. 
The neighbors all do loudly bawl 
When we climb their fences no matter how tall; 
And down the apples and peaches do fall, 
When into their orchards we make a 
call. 
We never study so very hard, 
For a 
dunce we'd rather be; 
And on a 
stool we stand in school— 
No books for him and me. 
We are too fat to learn to spell, 
We never will be wise; 
We 
sit all day in the sun and play 
At baking and making mud pies, 
(Chorus).

The Greatest Trick Book of the Ages 
HilliPTY DIMPTY., 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
ft is a Lao simile of a Trick practiced by ai 
the Professors of Magic. 
PirrikAiftWel","". 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
- , 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordea 
has been sent us, called 
ilTIMPTY DumpTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear. 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking if 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only.one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at.home in the handtii 
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.'
