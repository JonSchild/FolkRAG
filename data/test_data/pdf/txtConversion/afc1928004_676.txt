THE MULE THAT LIVES IN OUR BARN. 
(Parody on Jenny the Flower of Kildare.) 
Written and sung by ?Am. DRESSER. 
I've a 
mule that is lonely to-night, 
Because he can't eat a 
carload of hay, 
He wants the very finest of grub, 
And expects oyster stews every day; 
If you would only go near him I'm sure you'd not fear him 
You would think he could do you no harm, 
But he would kick you so high into the sweet by-and- bye, 
That you'd not forget the mule in our barn. 
Citonus: 
When this mule he would kick, he'd make the neighbor-
hood sick, 
He laid a 
fence out to dry on our farm, 
He was troubled with mumps, Christmas bunions and 
humps, 
You should see the trick mule in our barn. 
He tried to kick off the late comet's tail, 
Just to show the bohemians a 
trick; 
And if he'd get hungry you can bet your sweet life, 
He'd eat butter when spread on a 
brick. 
He was jack of all trades, how he loved lemonades, 
He made a 
noise like a 
fire alarm, 
He was used as a 
plot in the opera Mascotte, 
Was this mule that we had in our barn. 
CHORUS : 
He was death on school teachers, Lord how he loved 
preachers, 
For his family he did not give a 
darn; ' 
He'd blow in every cent of the Revised Testament 
Would this mule that we had la our barn, 
CAN YOU SKATE?

In walking 
walking through the streets each day, 
Expressions you will hear; 
And when they come back to your mind, 
No doubt they sound right queer. 
But a 
new one that I 
worked last night, 
I 
surely must relate; 
A 
fellow yelled as I 
passed by, 
Say, old boy, can you skate? 
CHORUS. 
Can you skate? 
No, I 
can't skate, 
But my sister, Kate, can skate; 
Sometimes cuts the figure eight, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
Can you skate? 
No, I 
can't skate, 
But my sister, Kate, can skate; 
Sometimes cuts the figure eight, 
Well, I 
should ejaculate. 
I 
wandered on a 
little ways, 
Two maidens then I 
met; 
They were so really lovely, 
That those two I 
can' t 
forget. 
Oh, yes, they looked so charming, 
Just like some little tease; 
But imagine my astonishment, 
When one says, can you 81WM 1 
et. 
CAN YOU SKA.
TE ?—Co.Nurrum. 
CHORUS 
Can you sneeze? No, I 
can sneeze, 
But my sister, Louise, can sneeze; 
Sometimes proves an awful tease, 
When she eats, it's a 
go as you please. 
Can you sneeze? 
No, I 
can't sneeze, 
But my sister, Louise, can sneeze; 
Sometimes proves an awful tease, 
When she eats, it's a 
go as you please. 
To show you how expressions go, 
I 
went to a 
fancy ball; 
And there, you bet, your :bottom dollar, 
I 
heard the worst of all. 
A 
maiden fair, with golden hair, 
Who caught me at a 
glance; 
Walked over to me, and remarked, 
Say, Slobsy, can you dance? 
CHORUS: 
Can you dance? No, I 
can't dance, 
But my sister, Nance, can dance; 
Sometimes makes a 
pair of pants, 
For my sister, and my cousins and my aunts. 
Can you dance? No, I 
ean't dance, 
But my sister, Nance, can dance; 
Sometimes makes a 
pair of pants, 
For my sister, and my cousins and my aunts.

PARODY ON SCOTCH, LASSIE JEAN. 
Written and sung by PAUL DRESSER. 
In the little town of Ishkosh, not very far from here, 
I 
think its in the State of Kalamazoo; 
Lives my little darling girl, and she works in a 
slaughter 
house, 
Her father and her mother live on glue; 
No matter where I 
roam, I 
hear her singing home-sweet-
home, 
And also when the swallows homeward fly; 
)3ut she paralyzes me, when she sings I 
think of thee, 
She's my cerebro-spinal meningitis Lize. 
CEIORIIS: 
Oh, Lize, Oh, Lize,you've been eating custard pie, 
And your breath would kill the angels in the skies; 
Oh, they say you wear false teeth, but I 
think it is untrue, 
You are my web-foot, big-mouthed, knock-kneed, cross-
eyed Lize. 
When first I 
saw your smiling face, you were buying ten 
cent lace, 
And you also bought a 
bees-wax colored shawl; 
You tried to stand them off a 
week, but you did not have 
the cheek, 
So you went and borrowed your oldest brother's gall; 
You were stuck on Henry Ward Beecher, Roscoe Conkling 
was your teacher, 
And you also smoked a 
five cent cigarette; 
You got a 
dollar for moulding grass, and two cents for 
bottling gas, 
And sixty days for whistling Olivette,

PARODY ON SCOTCH LASSIE JEAN—Cowrawn. 
Now, there's your brother Jake, he takes the onions and 
the steak, 
Especially when he gets on a 
tear; 
It's then he gets quite frisky, and loads up on five cent 
whiskey, 
Till a 
policeman takes him in his kindly care. 
He is a 
gay deceiver, and he's had the yellow fever, 
He peddles sandwich life preservers on a 
boat; 
You will see him everywhere, busy crystallizing air, 
For his mother-in-law he'd pawn his overcoat. 
Cnonus: 
Oh, Jane, oh, Jane, I 
will surely go insane, 
If you will only come near me once again; 
Oh, I 
hate to cause you pain, but your brother James G. 
Blaine, 
Says your my speckled, freckled, henpecked Liza Jane.

A 
BOOZER AND A 
LOSER. 
Parody on Mary Ann. 
Written by PAUL DRESSER, and sung by him with great success. 
--: 0 :— 
A new expression that caught me, 
I 
heard it first last night, 
While walking through the busy streets, 
Gazing at the sights; 
A 
friend of mine came passing bye, 
His face with smiles was beaming, 
But I 
saw the twinkle in his eye, 
When he says to me good evening. 
CHORUS: 
Then when this girl would talk to me, 
I 
really felt so clever, 
I 
do not think that two lamp-posts, 
Our plighted love, could sever; 
Have you seen Olivette? not yet, my pet, 
No, no, never; 
Are you going to the ball this evening, baby? 
Well, hardly ever. 
I 
know not what it really meant, 
They were shouting in my ear; 
But everywhere I'd wander, 
This expression I 
would hear; 
But I 
got on when a 
fellow said, 
Are you going to the ball this evening? 
For I 
fell down two flights of stairs, 
For saying not this evening.

A BOOZER AND A LOSER— CONTINUED. 
The babies on our block got drunk, t 
With a 
lot of other coons; 
My sister, she went on a 
tear, 
With the order of full moons; 
When Christmas comes, the babies will 
Be hanging up their socks; 
Mother-in-law will go on a 
tear, 
With old grandfather's clock. 
CHORUS: 
Then it's boozer here, boozer there, 
Everywhere it's boozer; 
If you get in among that gang, 
They'll play you till you're a 
loser; 
They'll work you up in elegant style, 
I 
tell you it is true, sir; 
You will find out what it is to be, 
A 
boozer and a 
loser.

PARODY ON NEVER TAKE THE HORSE-
SHOE FROM THE DOOR. 
: 
0:— 
Written and sung by PAUL DRESSER. 
-: 
0 :— 
There's a 
little sausage factory round the corner, 
Where you get the little weenies by the pound, . 
And you ought to see the butcher on the watch, my boys, 
If he sees a 
first-class poodle dog around. 
CHORUS: 
They will gather up the canines every morning, 
And throw them out behind the butcher's door; 
To one and all I 
give you timely warning, 
Never eat the weenies any more. 
There are yellow dogs and terriers in the sausages. 
And they do them up in any style you wish. 
And if you go in to a 
fine saloon, my boys, 
You will find that weenies is the leading dish. 
CHORUS: 
Now I 
like to eat as well as anybody, 
But, people, don't you think it is a 
sin 
To pay them fifteen cents for their poor whiskey, 
And have a 
yellow homeless dog thrown in. 
PARODY ON NEVER TARE THE HORSESHOE 
FROM THE 
DOOR—CONTINUED. 
Now the actors they all like to eat the sausages, 
Especially when they are on the mash; 
And if you go into a 
five cent boarding house, 
You will hear the people call them actor's hash. 
CHORUS: 
Just let an actor see an eight day poodle, 
Then right for a 
saloon his nobs will steer; 
And very soon you'll see the actor loaded 
In bull tarriers and second handed beer. 
For the benefit of suffering humanity, 
And all my friends who usually guzzle; 
In the future you can get all the sausages you want, 
If they find a 
dog around'without a 
muzzle. 
CHORUS: 
Then call the police around you every evening. 
Tell them they must not eat a 
hog; 
But have the superintendent to notify the butchers 
Every time they kill a 
yellow dog.

Parody on Eldest Daughter Clara, 
Composed and sling by PAUL pair-sax& 
o,--
I've a 
beautiful mother-in-law, 
She looks like a 
butcher shop sign; 
She always looks neat and such beautiful feet, 
And her shoe is a 
small number nine; 
When she does the coffee-pot act, 
And powders herself with a 
broom; 
If you'd see her face, be heavens you'd swear 
That her breath would keep up a 
balloon. 
CHORUS: 
She waltzes me round upon my nose,—(Break.) 
She kicks the buttons all off my clothes,—(Break.) 
When she makes her appearance boys, 
Like Tom cats, we fight and we claw; 
Tom Allen, he never would stand a 
chance, 
In front of my mother-in-law. 
She had a 
desire to go on the stage, 
And be an actress of fame; 
She wanted to call herself Madam Loosecheese, 
When McGuinness that was her right name; 
You could hear her shout for four blocks away, 
This beautiful lemonade star; 
Three neighbors of ours went to the asylum, 
On account of my mother-in-law. 
She gave imitations of Sarah Bernhardt, 
On the clarionet she tried to spiel; 
One night she threw up a 
pair of suspenders, 
In the death scene of the play called Camille. 
Her style was very much like Miss Morris, 
In her acting you'd not find a 
flaw; 
Jack Haverly offered her a 
dollar a 
night, 
So that croaked my poor mother-in-law.

BOARthNG HOUSE BUTTER. 
Written, composed and sung by Penn DRESEISPL 
I 
like to see things as they're represented, 
But they're not always just as they seem; 
Go into a 
four dollar hash house, 
There you see the bright side of life's dream. 
But the subject that I'm going to sing about now 
Is something that will make your heart flutter, 
If you want to enjoy yourself, 
Tackle some ancient boarding house butter. 
CHORUS.—Butter with wrinkles on it, 
Butter that oft takes a 
fit, 
Bald-headed butter too utterly utter, 
Butter that has seen better days; 
Butter that's almost worn out, 
Butter that will give you the gout, 
Oleomargarine made out of benzine, 
Strong butter, well, I 
should shout. 
SECOND CHORUS. 
Hash that's been on many drunks, 
Hash made from the hinges of trunks; 
flash made of onions, 
Hash frescoed with bunions, 
Hash that they sleep on for bunks. 
Hash that would make a 
lamp flicker, 
Hash that is worse than bad liquor; 
Hash neuter gender, made out of suspenders, 
Good hash, well, I 
should snicker. 
THIRD CHORUS. 
Cheese that could walk every mile 
In 2, well, I 
should smile; 
Cheese for your breakfast, 
Cheese 'way from Texas, 
Cheese as strong as a 
big William goat. 
Cheese that's been thrown in the gutter, 
Cheese that's worse than the butter; 
Cheese that's got speckles 
And red-headed freckles, 
Cheese it, well, I 
should stutter, 
CUR AT MY REELS. 
As sung by W ILLIAMS & SULLY to many smiles. 
0 :---
I 
dislike to trust men who hang on to the truth,. 
And haven't the nerve to tell lies; 
I 
like to hear a 
man say he killed fifty bears, 
When he knows in his heart they were flies., 
It may not be pleasant to have five thousand dollars 
Given you by each tramp you meet, 
But it's better to find your mother-in-law drunk 
Than to judge a 
poor girl by her feet. 
CHORUS: 
For I 
do like a 
Tom cat with a 
high tenor voice, 
A Maria that can kick, fight and steal; 
I 
like a 
spitz poodle with all kinds of fleas, 
But I 
don't like a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to see a 
chambermaid in a 
hotel 
Go through every new boarder's trunk, 
I 
like to see a 
preacher on Sunday in church, 
And on Monday in debt or on a 
drunk; 
I 
don't like a 
maiden of sweet sixty-four 
To tell me she's just seventeen, 
But give me the girl from old Boston town 
Who can wrestle with baked pork and beans. 
CHORUS: 
For I 
do like boiled eggs that have seen better days, 
I 
can paralyze all kinds of veal; 
I 
can battle successfully with all kinds of soup, 
But I 
don't care to miss a 
square meal.

Far away in the South, among the cotton fields, 
is the place I

was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me; 
Oh I

While far from the spot I 
now roam, 
In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go,. 
There is no place like the dear old home.

love is sleeping in the ground, 
When I 
am passing so fast away, 
And my heart grows so sad I 
long to return, 
Oh! the old man ain't what he used to be; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
'Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
Okrtj will go back again, back to them cotton

A. VIOLET FROM MOTHER'S GRAVE, 
Words and Music by W ILL H. Fox. 
Sung by Wu. McALooN in all the principal Theatres in America, and 
by O'NEIL & CONROY. 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days; 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant has 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
How well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
AlWays knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing 
retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave.

Empty Is The Stable, -navy's Gone. 
Written by BEN COLLINS. COPYRIGHTED, 1881, by A. J. Funsiut 
bung with great success by LESTER & W ILL/AIM 
I 
used to own a 
donkey, a 
bob-tail stubborn mule, 
He was born about the year of '49; 
His head was full of scars from stopping Railroad cars, 
He was ring-boned, spavined, deaf and blind; 
He could kick a 
steam engine, and raise you through 
the roof, 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs; 
He died at half past four, he's gone to that beautifu' 
shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
GnoRus: 
Gone to join the angels with spit-curls on his hair, 
Died with epizootic in the head; 
He might have gone to Congress if he only lived, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
His hoof was like a 
slungshot, he could raise you 
through the roof, 
He'd come into the house and kick you out of bed; 
His feet was full of bunions, he could eat a 
barrel of 
onions, 
And go to sleep a 
standing on his head; 
He'd go to a 
saloon, shove his hoof through a 
spittoon 
And kick the bar into the gutter for a 
joke, 
When he laid down and died, every mule in Jersey died 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Davy's left the stable for the promised land, 
His overshoes and saddle are in pawn; 
No more hay he'll ever chew, they've turned him into 
glue, 
Empty is the stable Davy's gone.

None but buffaloes will be there, 
At Casey's Tin Pan Wedding. 
There will be ale, stale beer and whisky. 
Goose chowder and cat pie; 
And when Casey he gets tipsy, 
He will slug Riley in the eye; 
Old Pat Shay and Tim Maloney, 
From the town of Donnegal; 
Danced a 
reel for stale bologna, • 
On the top of Casey's wall.

was sent to jail; 
My friends found that it was in vain 
To get me out on bail; 
The jury found me guilty, 
The Clerk he wrote it down, 
The Judge then passed my sentence—. 
I 
was sent to Charlestown. 
To see my aged father 
A 
standing at the bar, 
Likewise my aged mother 
A 
tearing of her hair— 
The tearing of her old gray locks, 
While the tears came rolling down, 
Baying: " Son, dear son, what have you done, 
That you are sent to Charlestown."

THE BOSTON BURGLAR—CoNmuED. 
I 
was put on board an eastern train, 
That cold December day, 
And every station that we passed, 
I'd hear the people say: 
There goes that Boston burglar, 
In strong chains he'll be bound; 
For some crime or another, 
He is off to Charlestown. 
There is a 
girl in Boston, 
A 
girl that I 
love well, 
And if ever I 
get my liberty, 
Along with her I'll dwell; 
And if ever I 
get my liberty, 
Bad company I'll shun, 
Likewise night walking, gambling, 
And also drinking rum. 
All you who have your liberty, 
Pray keep it if you can, 
And don't go 'round the streets at night 
To break the laws of man, 
For if you do you'll surely rue, 
And find yourself like me, 
'Who am serving out my twenty-one years 
In the penitentiary.

As sung by LESTER & Wnor.T4ms. 
o:— 
Such a 
lot of dizzy fairies every day you'll meet, 
Forty-five cent switches on their heads, no stockings 
on their feet; 
Living on free lunches and clam chowder, 
Their cheeks and faces disfigured with common paint 
and powder. 
CHORUS: 
You're a 
brick, whist, whist, 
You make me sick, whist, whist, 
Oh, pull up your skirts and run around the 
park; 
Give him a 
brace, whist, whist, 
Poison face, whist, whist, 
Is what those dizzy maidens all remark. 
While seated with a 
fairy and enjoying the breeze, 
Of the kidney stew and liver and limburger cheese, 
When in a 
bruiser came and said, young fellow, this 
looks queer, 
If you don't let my girl alone, I'll bite your ear. 
CHORUS: 
Up I 
got, whist, whist, 
Away I 
shot, whist, whist, 
And they sat down at the table with a 
whist, 
whist, whist; 
So if you're flip, whist, whist, 
Always skip, whist, whist, 
When a 
bruiser comes to claim his girl, get 
up and get.

In My Backyard there Dwells a 
Cat.

0: 
Sung with success by ANDY COLLOK. 
In my backyard there dwells a 
cat, 
In my backyard there dwells a 
cat. 
And his nibs is very fat; 
He watched four years for a 
bobtail rat, 
He tore in two my high silk hat. 
He is lazy, he is crazy, lazy, crazy, 
He is a 
tramp. 
He is husky, is musty, 
His ears they are musty, 
His name is McClusky, 
lie is very fond of beer. 
He is a 
snoozer, a 
boozer, 
All night he is a 
cruiser, 
The butchers they are losers, 
Who live both far and near. 
In the daytime he sleeps in the sun, 
In the daytime he sleeps in the sun, 
And you can bet he is full of fun; 
His teeth is loose from chewing gum, 
His nose is blue from drinking rum. 
He is a 
howler, 
A 
prowler, and a 
me-owler, 
Lives on clam chowder, paint and powder, 
He is a 
bum. 
When the stars are beaming, 
This Tomcat is screaming, 
The neighbors they are dreaming, 
And pull their hair with fright. 
Bootjacks and pistols, 
Policemen's clubs and missiles, 
This cat does always whistle 
As he flies through the air.

Flower From My Angel Mother's Grave.

Sung with great success by the German emperor, Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my. angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my mem'ry, &c.

Written by JAMES RICHMOND. 
Recited by PAT Roorrey with great success. 
McCormick had a 
Jack-ass, 
Blind in the teeth, lame in one eye; 
He had a 
celebrated record, 
For eating water and drinking pie; 
This Jack-ass was a 
high kicker, 
He won many an undisputed prize; 
He kicked out seven rows of Mrs. Murphy's teeth, 
And jabbed out both her eyes. 
McCormick's Mule 
This mule was born in Ireland, 
He wears the Shamrock on his nose; 
At the Centennial he stole an iron safe, 
And dressed himself in a 
suit of clothes; 
He broke into a 
Jewelry store, 
Stabbed the proprietor with a 
nail; 
Chased four Policeman into the river, 
And set fire to the Jail. 
McCormick's Mu 
McCormick was arrested, and produced the mule, 
For him all the neighbors had a 
grudge; 
He slapped the Jury in the mouth with his tail, 
And kicked the neck-tie off the Judge; 
The mule escaped, and they held McCormick, 
For the doings of the mule he was tried; 
He was just getting ten years' sentence, 
When a 
telegram came the mule had died.

Papa's chest protector's faded, 
Lost the color on his chest; 
Faded now for once and ever,

Oh, the many years he's worn it, 
Never has it seen a

How our bull-pup slept upon it, 
And from it he's caught the mange. 
CHORUS: 
Papa, papa, darling papa, 
Don't spread your mug at me with wrath; 
For it's true that you've grown lighter, 
Since you took that Turkish bath. 
Think of when you had the jira-jams, 
How I 
never left your bed; 
How I 
hired Tom Jones, the Cooper, 
To put a 
hoop around your head; 
Oh, my gall, how you do flutter, 
For, of chest protectors, when I 
think 
How you've oft protected papa, 
When he's braced men for a 
drink.

Pap, you darling, old brace, papa, 
At hoisting schooners you're the boss; 
But your nose is growing brighter, 
Since you've beeu budging at O'Rourke&

PARODY ON BABIES ON OUR BLOCK.---CoYrnrugn. 
There's an Italian kid just two years old, 
With eyes in the back of his head, 
You can guess how the daddy feels 
When the young one's hair is red; 
Some have got no eyes, and some have got no nose, 
And a 
black and tan kid 
With an elephant hoof 
And fortyileven toes; 
Some's draniatic, some's lunatic, 
One kid has a 
wooden ear, 
Another one, they call Napoleon, 
Drinks his barrel of lager beer. 
They'll rear and tare, 
And pull their hair, 
Until your nerves they shock, 
They'll scream and yell, 
And raise old fun, 
The babies on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Fabseteeth, 
Sitting in a 
custard pie, 
A 
crying 'cause her little brother 
Slugged her in the eye. 
Rise, Sally, rise, knock his eye out with a 
rook, 
For there's a 
hundred times more babies 
Than there's daddies on our block.

'See that my Grave is Whitewashed 
Every Summer. 
Written by Js. McAyoy expressly for the SPARKS BROTHERS' and sung 
by them with tremendous success. 
When I've cashed in my checks, little Rosebud, 
When I 
am six foot under the turf, 
I 
forgive you, but you played me for a 
gilly, 
You worked me for every nickel I 
was worth. 
Oh, you said I 
could look, but mustn't touch, 
And you put me in such a 
dilemma .; 
But there is one little snap I 
want to fake up between us— 
That is, see that my gt ave is whitewashed every summer. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to your poison face. 
Think of how you backcapped me when I 
was living. 
Clean the snow off, when I'm planted, with a 
shovel, 
darling, 
And decorate my grave with turkeys' breasts, Thanks-
giving. 
Don't get cranky when I 
ask you to remember, 
When you used to give me taffy on the stick, 
And with your funny gags you paralyzed ,me— 
But, my darling, you can't say I 
ever kicked. 
I 
will meet you in the happy land of Canaan, 
Tra-la-lee, skip the sewer, for you are my baby; 
Plant huckleberry trees in the next lot to where I'm 
planted, darling, 
And see that my grave is kept shady. 
Oh the days w ill come, &

crazy daughter, she's foolish in her head; 
She never minds me in anything I

She's always reading song books, never goes to bed, 
For her schooling every month I 
have to pay. 
She's stuck on the profession—on actors she is mashed— 
She's crazy for to work in Harry Hill's. 
She has challenged Murphy and Rowell to win O'Leary's belt, 
She is the laughing stock for all the gills. 
CHORUS. 
Eileen banana, sweet Louisiana, 
Slobbery days, baby mine. 
Flaherty's frisky from drinking whiskey, 
What an education has Miss Rubenstein. 
I 
sent her to the country to benefit her health, 
For the people on our block are mighty glad. 
Ever since she's been away she's never been herself, 
And the folks they say she's raving staving mad. 
She walks the streets barefooted, wears her sister's clothes, 
Rings the door bells on our block each day; 
She's milking all the chickens, feeding corn to cows, 
And scares the people when they hear her say— 
Eileen banana, &c.

CUMBERLAND'S CREW. 
Sung with great success by Devlin & Tracy. 
Oh! shipmates, come, gather and join in my ditty, 
It's of a 
terrible battle that happened of late; 
Let each good Union-Tar shed a 
sad tear of pity, 
When he thinks of the once gallant Cumberland's fate. 
The eighth day of March told a 
terrible story, 
And many a 
brave tar to this world bid Adieu 
Yet our Flag it was wrapt in a 
mantle of glory, 
By the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's crew. 
On that ill-fated day about ten in the morning, 
The sky it was clear, and bright shone the sun; 
The drums of the Cumberland sounded a 
warning 
That told every seaman to stand by his gun. 
An Iron-clad Frigate down on us came bearing, 
And high in the air the Rebel Flag flew; 
The Pennant of Treason she proudly was waving, 
Determined to conquer the Cumberland's crew. 
Then up spoke our Captain with stern resolution, 
Saying: my boys, of this monster now don't be dismayed. 
We swore to maintain our beloved Constitution, 
And to die for our country we are not afraid! 
We fight for the Union, our cause it is glorious, 
To the Stars and Stripes we will stand ever true; 
We'll sink at our quarters, or conquer victorious! 
Was answered,with cheers,from the Cumberland's crew, 
Now our gallant ship fired her guns' dreadful thunder, 
Her broad- side, like hail, on the Rebel did pour. 
The people gazed on, struck with terror and wonder, 
The shots struck her sides and glanced harmless o'er; 
89 
CUMEERLA__ND'S CREW.—Continued. 
But the pride of our Navy could never be daunted, 
Tho' the dead and the wounded her deck they did strew; 
And the Flag of the Union, how proudly it flaunted, 
Sustained by the blood of the Cumberland's crew. 
Slowly they sunk beneath Virginia's waters, 
Their voices on earth will ne'er be heard more— 
They'll be wept by Columbia's brave sons and fair daughters 
May their blood be avenged on Virginia's shore !— 
In that battle stained grave they are silently lying— 
Their souls have forever to earth bid Adieu !— 
But the Star-Spangled Banner above them is flying, 
It was nailed to the mast by the Cumberland's crew. 
They fought us three hours, with stern resolution, 
Till those Rebels found cannon would never avail them' 
For the Flag of Secession has no power to gall them, 
Tho' the blood from their scuppers it crimsoned the tide; 
She struck us amid-ship, our planks she did sever, 
Her sharp iron-prong pierced our noble ship through; 
And still, as they sank on that dark rolling river, 
We'll die at our guns! cried the Cumberland's crew. 
Columbia's sweet birth- right of Freedom's communion, 
Thy Flag never floated so proudly before; 
For the spirits of those that died for our Union, 
Above its broad folds now exaltingly soar !— 
And when our sailors in battle assemble, 
God bless our dear Banner: the Red, White and Blue! 
Beneath its bright Stars we'll cause tyrants to tremble, 
Or sink at our guns, like the Cumberland's crew.

My grandfather, he, at the age of eighty-three, 
One day he took a 
notion he would die; 
And after he was dead, of course the will was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all were passing by; 
Unto my brother Bill, he left an old saw mill, 
To my sister he bequeated our gray mare, NanceN 
But when it came to me, the lawyer then, said he 
Has left to you his old brown pants. 
CHORUS: 
But how they giggled, how they yelled, 
Even my sister, my dear Isabel; 
Gave me the laugh whene'er she had the chance, 
When grandpa only left to me his old brown pants. 
My brother Bill one day, just to pass the time away, 
In the river, why he thought he'd take a 
swim; 
When a 
stray goat showed his nose, and he eat up 
poor Bill's clothes, 
, It was Summer, and his garments they were thin; 
Now Bill he kicked and swore, when he couldn't 
leave the shore, 
And I 
saw his situation at a 
glance; 
I 
give one laugh and yell, I 
said now brothel., Bill, 
Don't you wish you had the old brown pants.

et her I'll have to marry, for I'm Scarface Susan's beau. 
She's a 
colored angel, you ought to see her feet, 
Standing on the side-walk, they reach across the street; 
Her tongue would make an ulster, and it's always on 
the go, 
Yet still I 
dearly love her, for I'm Scarface Susan's 
beau. 
CHORUS. 
4,3arface Susan Johnson, ain't she got a 
craw, 
3fle'd chew an iron fence-rail if she got it in her jaw; 
'-ler mouth would make a 
cellar, where a 
ton of coal could 
go, 
till1 think her handsome, for I'm Scarface Susan's beau. 
Scarface Susan Johnson, ain't she got a 
gaul, 
She waltzes on her eye-brow at every colored ball; 
When they see her stockings, the ladies cry oh! oh! 
And say I 
ought to wash them, for I'm Scarface 
Susan's beau. 
Cross-eyed scarface Susan, she sometimes makes me cry, 
She often has erected a 
French flat on my eye; 
sometimes try to shake her, but she will not let me go, 
Though I'd rather be a 
quaker, or a 
german bretzel baker, 
)r a 
hook-nosed sheeny baker, or a 
chinese undertaker, 
let my wife I'll have to make her, 
'for I'm Scarface Susan's beau.

OUR SAILORS ON THE SEA, 
Sang at HAnnicust & HIRT'S Theatre Comique by 
Mx EDWIN BARRY. 
Music published and copyrighted by I', W. Thrtarpar, 
Cincinnati, Ohio. 
At night when we are lying on 
Our beds, secure and warm, 
We hear the mourning winds that tell, 
The coming of the storm; 
The lightning flashed, the thunder roared 
Around its childish glee, 
On such a 
night may God protect 
Our sailors on the sea. 
On such a 
night may God protect 
• 
Our sailors on the sea. 
Cnonvs: 
Amidst the raging of the storm, 
We humbly ask of thee, 
Oh! Father, in thy mercy save 
Our sailors on the sea. 
Oh! Father, in thy mercy save 
Our sailors on the sea. 
The sailor little thinks; when he 
• Lets out upon the wave, 
The worn-out ship in which he sails, 
May bear him to his grave; 
Should storm arise, her rotten planks 
To pieces soon may go; 
Yet ships like this are sent to sea, 
That man may richer grow. 
Yet ships like this are sent to sea, 
That man may richer grow. 
(Chorus)

HOG PEN'S EMPTY, PIGGY'S GONE. 
[Parody.] 
Composed by LON HAYLIL 
Air.—Empty Cradle. 
Little empty pig pen smells so nice and sweet, 
How the precious burden used to squeal;' 
We can have some roast pork and pickled pig's feet, 
And some fresh spare ribs every meal. 
We killed him with a 
knife at the right time of the moor, 
And scrubbed him till the break of dawn; 
Now he's in the barrel, salted for evermore, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone. 
Cnonts: 
Piggy's left the swill-trough to eat from it no , more, 
O'er the briny water he has flown; 
Gone to join the Boers on Africa's shore, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone. 
Near the cellar door stands a 
barrel now, 
Overhead the cob-webs are thick; 
It always makes us sad when we think of him now, 
And the many times we scratched him with a 
stick. 
He could play seven up, and draw poker too, 
And sing all the latest songs; 
Now lies in a 
barrel packed forever more, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone, (Chorus).

Man You Don't Meet Every Day. 
0:--
Written and Sung with great success by DAN Commute. 
I've a 
neat little cabin that's built out of mud, 
Not far from the County Kildare; 
I've an acre or two where I 
grow my own spuds, 
I've enough and a 
little to spare; 
Sure I've not come over here seeking your jobs, 
But a 
short little visit to pay; 
So be aisy and free while you're drinking with me, 
I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
I've a 
neat little colleen that dwells in my cot, 
Oh, happy, contented is she; 
I've a 
thumping big lad that will say to his dad, 
There's a 
man you don't meet every day; 
And when for my leisure I'm out for a 
walk, 
The boys they all stop and they stare; 
And they say to each other as I'm passing by, 
There's a 
man you don't meet every day.

SINGING ON TUE ROOF. 
Words and Music by J. P. SSELLT. SunKby O'NEIL and CONROT. 
Copyrighted, 1879, and published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bower,. 
The Music of this song will be sent to any address, post 
paid, on receipt of price, 10 cents. 
There's sixteen dacent families 
In the house where I 
reside; 
On summer nights to cheer ourselves 
All pleasures we have tried, 
But on the roof it's best of all, 
To hear us would be proof, 
We make the neighborhood resound, 
All singing on the roof. 
Singing on the roof, the boys and girls together. 
We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo, 
The Murphys and O'Neils come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms, 
With pleasant conversation then, 
Sure every one she charms. 
There's Rosy Dunn and Reiley's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud, they join the crowd, 
All singing on the roof. 
Singiva 
etc. 
Young Roger Flynn got up to dance, 
With a 
lady from next door, 
"Come welt the tin," says Roger Flyrrn, 
"It's like a 
ball-room toor." 
Then one by one they joined the fun, 
Sure, none could hold aloof, 
It was a 
sight that summer night, 
To see them on the roof. 
Singing, ate. 
Now that's the place to spend the night, 
And feel that pleasant breeze, 
Take up your pipe and stretch yourself 
In an attitude of ease. 
The boys and girls will gather round, 
And fill the air with glee, 
When singing on the roof at night, 
As happy as can be. 
Singing, eto. 
The Order of Old Bums. 
Written by Jerry Cohan and sung with great 8uccess by 
Billy Carter. 
The secret order of old bums, for gall will take the cake, 
They recognize the pass word, it's " What'll you have to 
take ?" 
We likes to drink, we likes to eat, and don't waste drops 
or crumbs, 
Cops and rounders all are on to the order of old bums. 
CHORUS. 
The first degree—charge it to me—then your eye you 
wink, 
The bottle tip, the glass you grip—password—What de 
drink? 
• 
For the back 
of 
your 
neck 
and 
the 
seat 
of 
your 
pants, 
The landlord gently comes, 
And lands you on the sidewalk in the order of old bums, 
When the little cop is staying, in some door way for a 
snooze. 
he " Bums" are on the war-path laying, 
For a 
lunch, a 
grasshopper, or booze, boo, booze.

THE ORDER 01' OLD BUMS.—Continued. 
The watermelon season for a 
change will sometimes suit, 
And when we can't get soft shell crabs why then we'll 
tackle fruit. 
We work the bar for all it's worth till the landlord for us 
comes, 
We furnish politicians from the order of old bums. 
FIRST DEGREE SET TO. 
in the spring time and the summer, 
To the green fields and hen roosts off we goes, 
But in the winter the poor bummer, 
Must hustle in the jail for feed and clothes. I 
suppose. 
SECOND DEGREE SET TO. 
The object of this order is to walk when we can't ride, 
And fill ourselves with lager from the empty keg outside, 
We smoke the best Havana buts, and share 'em with our 
chums. 
And an unprotected clothesline is a Christmas for the 
bums. 
THIRD DEGREE SET TO. 
At election time it is our oyster— 
To the polls we gently, gently stray, 
And of schooners the burn is then a 
hoister, 
As he samples with the keg election day. 
What d'ye say. 
MACKEREL ROW. 
Parody on Gossip Row. Written by JAS. DREW, and sung with great 
success by DONNELLY & DREW. 
Our names is John and Thomas Ryan, 
We hail from the 17th ward, 
There's an alley way in 11th Street, 
Where we both live and board. 
The trials and tribulations there, 
We will tell it to you now ; 
The neighbors fight, both day and night, 
Way up in Mackerel Row. 
CHORUS: 
Good morning, Mr. Dogface, 
And did you hear the news, 
Skinny Dick went broke last night, 
To-day he has got the blues— 
He says he never gamble, 
At the game they call faro, 
They use him for a 
billiard cue; 
Way up in Mackerel Row. 
Oh whisper Mr, Pieface, 
To what I 
have to say, 
You threw a 
dirty tom cat, 
In my fine pot of tay; 
You are bloated up with whiskey, 
You remind me of a 
sow— 
Its in Blackwell's Isle you ought to be,. 
Instead of Mackerel Row. 
MACKEREL ROW—CONTINUED. 
Now listen toothless Riely, 
I've a 
mind to break your jaw, 
Did you go tell the neighbors, 
That I 
killed my mother-in-law; 
When you know she's -a 
daizy,' 
Well I'll tell it to you now, 
She's big and stout and got the gouts 
Way up in Mackerel Row. 
CHORUS: 
There's little Owney Geoghegan, 
He lost his coat and pants, 
He soaked them to his uncles, 
His cousin's and his aunts; 
Now he is singing comic songs, 
In Canada, Ioho; 
And an Italian junk, he lost his monk, 
Way up in Mackerel Row. 
Now listen cranky Clooney, 
What I 
have for your ear— 
1 
hear that politicians 
Are doing something queer; 
John Kelly has got the nightmare, 
And Hancock stole a 
cow, 
Mayor Grace he run a 
race, 
With a 
burn in Mackerel Row.

ME 
OLD FASHIONED HOME. 
Sang by NED BARRY at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre Comique, 
Broadway, New York. 
There's an old fashioned house in the old country, 
There's an old fashioned couple live there; 
There's an old fashioned gate by the old country road; 
And an old fashioned man near the chair; 
An old fashioned woman is sitting there, 
Darning an old pair of hose; 
With her old fashioned cap on her old fashioned head 
And she's dressed in her old fashioned clothes. 
near those bells, those merry bells, 
And they fill my soul with a 
thrill; 
'Tis the old fashioned sound from them old fashioned bells, 
In that old fashioned church on the hill. 
There's an old fashioned clock on that old whitewashed 
wall, 
With its old fashioned pendulum and hands; 
There's an old wooden bench by that old fireplace, 
With its bright copper kettles and pans; 
An old fashioned man is sitting there, - 
Smoking his old fashioned clay; 
With his old favorite dog sitting close by his side, 
Watching the children at play. 
Heaven bless that dear old pair, may they live for many 
years, 
In that dear, little house in the lane; 
May they never know a 
care, but all happiness to share 
And think of the dear, old happy days; 
The same I 
wish to you, with a 
heart of conscience true 
May you live, yes, for many. many years; 
May you never want for wealth, but enjoy the best of 
health, 
It is the earnest wish I 
give to you. 
Great Grandma Sarah jane.

AIR—Fire in the Grate. 
Grandma has tendered her resignation, 
From this wicked world of sin; 
She packed her valise and departed, 
It contained a 
pack of cigarettes and some nigger gin. 
She left her false teeth to Cousin Minnie, 
She gave pa the price of a 
shave, 
They put Dennis Kearney's picture on her tombstone, 
To keep the crows from off her grave. 
CHORUS— 
Her mind was always mashing, 
She was too fresh and awful shrewd; 
She weighed ninety pounds when in fighting condition, 
And she never smoked or chewed. 
She used to go fishing with Christopher Columbus, 
And shooting shadows till she went insane, 
For a 
curiosity she took the prize, 
My great grandma, Sarah Jane. 
She tried to sing bass and swallowed her teeth, 
Her lungs from eating snuff were sore; 
She was so bashful if there was a 
man in her room, 
She'd get up and shut the door. 
She willed her voice to her uncle's nephew, 
When she died she was one hundred and eighty-seven, 
They say she is cook in a 
five-cent restaurant, 
Four miles and a 
half from Heaven. 
Her mind was always, etc.

Here She Goes and There She Goes. 
Originally sung by EDWIN BARRY, at Harrigan dz Hart's Theatre Coraique 
Broadway, N. Y. 
When Tom declared his ardent love for Miss Amelia Brown, 
They asked papa to give consent, but he only gave a 
frown; 
Now Tom and his Amelia said that they'd elope to town, 
And married be, although it was against the wish of Brown; 
The very morning of their flight, old Brown at home would stay, 
I 
know they only wished for some good chance to run away. 
SPOKEN—I 
knew the boy loved the girl, and the old man 
didn't love the girl worth a 
cent. 
The old man was a 
kind 
of sporting man, and so I 
says, Brown, old boy, I 
want to lay 
you a 
wager. 
What is it ? says Brown. I 
want to bet you 
five dollars you can't swing your arm with the pendulum of 
that clock five minutes. Done ! says he, I 
take the bet. What 
have I 
got to do? 
All you have got to do is to follow me and 
go like this— 
- 
CHORUS. 
Here she goes and there she goes, 
Bib-a-de-bob, bib- a- de-bob, 
Here she goes and there she goes, 
And that is the way to do it. 
Old Brown he set to work at once and soon began to puff, 
I 
cried old Brown, I 
think you'll soon say you've had enough; 
I 
never laid a 
bet, said he, but what I 
mean to win, 
I 
bet another ten, said he, that I 
will not give in. 
57 
HERE SHE GOES AND THERE SHE GOES. 
Continued. 
Old Brown was fat, the weather warm, and never once he 
stopped, 
And there upon his heated face there stood the shining drops. 
SPOKEN—And I 
stood in the corner laughing; and old 
Brown still kept up the same old game— 
Here she goes, &c. 
Mrs. Brown who heard me laugh, came into the room to see; 
Oh goodness gracious, Brown, said she, what can the mat-
ter be ? 
Why, Brown, you must be going mad, of that there is no doubt, 
To stand in front of that old clock and swing your arms about; 
I'll go and fetch the doctor, Brown, if you go on this way, 
But all they could get out of Brown, and this is what he'd 
hay— 
Here she goes, &c. 
Old Brown he won the wager, but lost his daughter by the 
game, 
She married Tom in town that day, and back for forgiveness 
came; 
'Twas useless when the job was done for Brown to then 
say nay, 
So he took the joke, my friends, in quite a 
jolly way ; 
He gave a 
party to his friends and oftimes tells with glee, 
While sounds of laughter echo from the jolly company. 
SPOKEN— Yes, says the old man, I 
shall never forget the 
time I 
went— 
Here she goes, &c.

THE $5 
NOTE. 
A. 
Comic Song sung by FRANK Lzwis, EsQ., with tremendous success 
everywhere through the country. Written by FRED SHAW. 
One night as I 
was out with the boys to have a 
spree, 
Thro' drinking whisky punches, I 
was drunk as I 
could be; 
My cash it quickly flew, I 
very soon was broke, 
So I 
borrowed from a 
friend a $5 
note, 
CHORUS: 
If you listen to my song, while the funny things I'll quote, 
I'll tell you how I 
spent that $5 
note. 
As soon as I 
was fixed, I 
asked the boys to have a 
bowl, 
Which into my note made a 
very big hole; 
We had a 
round of punches, and then cigars to boot, 
Up went the first dollar of the $5 
note. 
The boys feeling hungry after drinking so much punch, 
We walked around the corner and we had a 
little lunch; 
They tackled oyster stews ' till I 
thought the boys would 
choke, 
And they soon eat up a 
dollar of the e5 note. 
Then we went to the Theatre to see the ladies prance, 
And to hear the comic songs, and the funny song and dance; 
One of the girls says I 
feel thirsty, and brandy would suit 
my throat, 
And she soon drank a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then we walked around the town called in a 
saloon or two, 
Then we went to see the ladies as the young men often do; 
One said she loved me, with her arms around my throat, 
And she soon got a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then as I 
was going home, just as drunk as I 
could be, 
A poor laboring man came slowly up to me; 
His family they were starving, and ragged was his coat, 
And he got the last dollar of the $5 
note.

Vile dinking of my younger days, 
Vich yos some years ago, 
I 
dought 0: many boyhood tricks 
Vich do not happen now; 
Of games ye played, of fun ye had, 
Vich now has passed away, 
Of sentences they used to give, 
So difficult to say. 
SPOKEN—De sentences vos— 
CHORUS. 
She stood at the gate welcoming him in, 
She stood at the gate welcoming him in, 
She stood at the gate welcoming him in, 
I 
dink you'll find it difficult to say. 
" 
The-op-ohs This-tie," it was hard, 
And " Peder Piper," too, 
De road de ragged ruffian ran," 
• 
Time tries tricks tough and true," 
But dese I 
overcome mit ease, 
As older I 
became, 
And many harder vones I 
fought, 
But it remained de same. 
SPOKEN—Somehow or anoder, I 
never could say, " She 
stood at de gate welcoming him in ;" any oder sentence vos 
easy; und so I 
suppose I 
viii go all my lifetime trying to say— 
She stood at the gate, &c.

BIG FOOT MARY ANN. 
Written by Wm. W ELSH expressly for BARNEY FERGUSON, and 
sung only by him with great success. 
I'm in love with a 
pretty girl, 
She's a 
darling to me sure; 
For style I'll bet she can't be beat, 
Sweet Mary Ann McClure. 
Oh, that's the cognomen of her, 
The one I 
love so dear; 
And as we walk along the street, 
The boys yell out: " She's queer." 
Cnottus: 
She has a 
turn-up nose, 
And on it is a 
dimple; 
Hump-backed, cross-eyed, with warts upon her hands, 
Bow-legged as she goes, 
Lob- sided, and she's simple, 
Oh, isn't she a 
handsome girl, my Big-foot Mary Ann. 
I 
took her up to see the show 
Last Wednesday afternoon; 
A 
young man for to sweep the stage 
Stepped out there with a 
broom; 
A 
little boy cried out, " You supe 
o " 
Oh, Mike, is it soup?" says she; 
• 
I'm dead with hunger, now look out, 
And order enough for three." (Chorus). 
I 
took her up the other night, 
To get some oyster stew; 
I 
asked her if she'd have some raw, 
When she ordered twenty-two dozen. 
Three dozen more upon half shell, 
I 
heard her loudly bawl, 
And before we left sure divil the bit 
But she eat up shells and all. (Chorus).

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
rt is a Pao simile of a Trick Practiced by 
ai 
the -Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is aceom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
t • " An ingertions little book of the thaumaturgic ordee 
has been sent us, °ailed Humpry DUMPTY, and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appean 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap• 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, ' 
in his tosselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing ut Pantaloon, or Hiding Hood, or Mephisto• 
pheles.

with the book will make anybody at home in the hand,
