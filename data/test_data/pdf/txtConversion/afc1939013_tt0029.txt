RECORD 10
(Made in Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, August 24, 1939. Stetson Kennedy, Intermediary,
interviewer; Robert Cook, operator, photographer.)
Item:
1) Ziomara Andux, age 13, and her sister, Evelia Andux, age 11, describe a game played
by the Cuban children in Ybor City, called “Amambrocha To.” To play the game, a group
of children line up, with the exception of one who faces the line and sing the first two lines
of the song; all the children in the line sing together in response. The game continues until
each of the children has been offered some agreeable “work” and have been adopted
by the original singer, who takes them and forms a line opposite. When all but one of the
children have been “adopted,” the game begins again.
As played for the recording, the name “Orbito” is used, because Orbito Andux was playing
the game with his two sisters. The work offered him is “cowboy,” which is said in English
because they could not think of the word for cowboy in Spanish. They say that they often
use English words in the game, such as cowboy, G-man, etc.

Miss Martinez Cockroach and Mr. Perez Mouse.
Once upon a time Miss Martinez Cockroach was sweeping the floor of her house when
she found a nickel. “What can I do with this nickel?”, she said. “If I buy candy, I will soon

eat it and when I will have no more,” “If I buy bread, I will soon eat it,” “If I buy a cake, I will
soon eat it. Oh my, what will I do? I know, I will buy me some flour.”
So she went to the grocery store and bought herself some flour. Then she dug herself into
the flour and came out white all over. Then she seated herself on the porch. Pretty soon
Mr. Goat came along. “How beautiful you are, Miss Martinez Cockroach: Do you want to
marry me?” “Yes”, said Miss Martinez Cockroach, But how do you do”? ”Baa 'Baa”, said
Mr. Goat. “Oh no: you frighten me”. So Mr. Goat went away.
Pretty soon Mr. Cow passed by. “How beautiful you are, Miss Martinez Cockroach: Do
you want to marry me?” “Yes said Miss Martinez Cockroach, “but how do you do?” “Moo—
Moo” said Mr. Cow. “Oh no: you frighten me”. So Mr. Cow went away.
Pretty soon Mr. Dog passed by. “How beautiful you are: Do you want to marry me?” “Yes”,
said Miss Martinez Cockroach, “But how do you do”? “Bow-wow” said Mr. Dog. “Oh no you
frighten me”. So Mr. Dog went away.

Pretty soon Mr. Perez Mouse passed by. “How beautiful you are, Miss Martinez
Cockroach: Do you want to marry me?” “Yes” said Miss Martinez Cockroach, “but how
do you do”? “Wee—Wee” said Mr. Perez Mouse. “Oh how good:” said Miss Martinez
Cockroach. “I will marry you”. So they were married.
One day Miss Miss Martinez Cockroach had to go shopping, so she told Mr. Perez Mouse
to watch the stew, but to be very careful and not look inside the pot as he might fall in.
When she had left, Mr. Perez decided he would take just one little peep. When he looked
inside, the stew smelled so good that he decided he would take one little sip. But when he
was going to put in his nose, he fell over and was killed.
After a while Miss Martinez Cockroach came to the house. “Toon, Toon” she knocked at
the door, but Mr. Perez Mouse did not come to open the door. Toon toon, she knocked

again, but still no answer. She was getting frightened. TOON, TOON, she knocked louder,
but still the door did not open. So she called Mr. Carpenter to open the door. Mr. Carpenter
came along with his hammer and crowbar, and crashed the door down. She ran to the
kitchen, and when she looked into the pot, she saw poor Mr. Perez Mouse dead in the
stew.

So she seated herself on the porch, and commenced to sing:
“Pobre ratoncito Perez Cayo en la olla Por la gelocina De una cebella”.
Poor little rat Perez Fell in the stew For the greediness Of an onion.
