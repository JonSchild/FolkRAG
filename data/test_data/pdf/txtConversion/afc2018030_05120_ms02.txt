Note: Dick and his son were processing venison on the day that I visited. The cold space was ideal for their 
purposes (in winter, Dick only heats the studio while he is working). However, it was not a good day to take many 
photos around the studio, since raw meat, bone saws, and the like had taken the place of Dick’s usual tools and 
clay.

This image shows part of Dick Lehman’s studio, including his wheel and utility sink. After working for years in a 
combined studio and retail facility at the Old Bag Factory, Dick designed and built this studio on the same 
property as his home.

A display of cups and tea bowls made by Dick Lehman. He has hung a sign below them that says “…a few of my 
favorite things…” These items are made in a substantially different style than the wares Dick made in previous 
years when he was running a production pottery at the Old Bag Factory.

The large sign toward the center of this photo, which features a line drawing of Dick throwing a pot, was once

The front of one of Dick Lehman’s business cards, which shows a line drawing of Dick throwing a pot. This same 
image was once used on a billboard in the early days of his business; the original sign still hangs in his studio.

The back of one of Dick Lehman’s business cards, which is written in Japanese. Dick has many friends who are 
potters in Japan and has travelled there many times. From top to bottom, the card gives the name of his business, 
his name, his phone number, email, and then website.
