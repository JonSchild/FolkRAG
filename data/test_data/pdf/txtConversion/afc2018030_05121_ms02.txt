To make the pots, casting slip is poured into plaster molds such as these. A shell of clay hardens to a certain 
thickness, and then the extra slip is poured out. The pot is then removed, cleaned, and smoothed. On some pieces, 
handles are cut out or added.

This photo shows a finished mug alongside the plaster blank that was used to create its mold. Since the clay 
shrinks some in the drying and firing process, the finished pot is slightly smaller than the original mold.

Shelves of unfinished, drying pots line the studio. After they are dry and their surfaces have been cleaned up, 
these will be bisque fired before they are glazed and then fired a final time.

These pieces have come out of the mold but aren’t ready to be bisqued yet; the edges will be smoothed and the 
mold marks visible on the handles will be fettled off.

This piece has come out of the mold but aren’t ready to be bisqued yet; the lip needs rounded and the holes that 
were drilled still need to be smoothed.

participate in. Nowadays, most of this information can be found online.
