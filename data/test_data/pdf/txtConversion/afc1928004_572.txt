Don't sh-jt out the moonlight, mother, 
Let each silver- lighted beam 
Softly on my dying pillow, 
In a 
flood of beauty stream, 
Let it shed its radiant lustre, 
On my feeble fluttering breast, 
Let it bathe me in its brightness, 
Ere I 
pass away to rest. 
CHORUS. 
Don't shut out the moonlight, motile, 
Let each siker lighted beam, 
Softly o'er lily dying pillow, 
LI

flood of beauty stream. 
Don't shut out the moonlight, inothet, 
I !lave ever loved that light, 
And have gazed for hours together, 
In some still andisolemn night. 
On the pale moon slowly floating, 
O'er the starry home on high. 
VPreatning of that land of plenty, 
Far beyond the azure sky. 
Don't Ant out the molnlight mother, 
Let it beam on tre once mole, 
Let it light me through the valley, 
To that far off peaceful shore. 
And when I 
am coldly lying 
In that last long dreanile-s 
Lay me where the silver moonbeams 
Softly o'er my 6rove will creep.

O'er the deep blue sea, 
When I 
breath the perfume of magnolias. 
Happy I

Side promised me her hand,

Soon will I 
be with her never more to part, 
Anxiously I'm waiting for the promised time, 
Then she'll be forever mine. 
When the magnolias bloom, 
When the magnolias bloom, 
Come back to me from o'er the sea, 
Dispel all my sorrow and gloom, 
When the magnolias bloom, 
Come back to me from o'er the sea, 
When the nvgnolias bloom. 
(Dante.) 
We'll live together in a 
cozy cottage, 
Love shall there abide, 
Surrounded by the sweetest of magnolias, 
Emblem of my bride. 
Oh ! happy joyous time, 
When blessed we will be, 
haste, oh ! haste the day when she will marry Me, 
Come, oh ! come, bright spring and open up 
the flowers, 
Bliss will be forever ours.

When I 
was a 
lad about sixteen, 
I 
travelled with a 
circus and sold ice cream; 
I 
polished up the handle of the elephants trunk, 
iind slept in a 
cage with a 
big sick monk. (Bre.tk, ) 
I 
done my work in such a 
rage, 
They made me ruler of the monkey's cage; 
I 
fed them on the European plan, 
And they got so weak they could not stand. 
When the show would commence, I'd watch for beats, 
With a 
club I'd sail round under the seats; 
My legs got crooked and my back got bent., 
Watching for kids sneaking under the tent. ( Break. 
I 
said " what, never," to a 
mule in fun, 
And got kicked through the roof of the big bass drum, 
It wasn't the fall that made me kick, 
But stopping quite so sudden made me sick. 
They brought me to, with a 
kerosene pump, 
And the doctor said I 
was off my chump, 
They laid me out on the trick mule's back, 
And I 
went through the roof when he took up 
the slack. (Break.) 
Came down head first, and went clean through a 
dray, 
The horse got frightened and he ran away; 
My voice got broke and my face got scarred. 
And now I'm door-tender in a 
big grave yard.

In the Fourth Ward I

My influence is wonderful, 
My grip is awful strong. 
I 
carry the ward in my pocket, 
I

On election day won't I 
look gay, 
When I'm running for Alderman. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I'm your candidate, (Break) 
And me sure you'll try to elect; (Break) 
There'll be no corn beef or cabbage, 
But fat turkey in the pan; 
Clam chowder will be at a 
discount, 
When O'Brieia's the Alderman. 
Dance. 
Ill have the seats all cushioned, 
For the lovers in the Park; 
I'll put fly net over the tunnels, 
To give them a 
chance to spark. 
I'll have the big lake white-washed, 
The tramps must leave the land, 
For it's then they'll know they'll stand no show, 
When O'Brien's the Alderman. 
Chorus. 
Now when I 
am elected, 
Such wonderful things I'll do; 
Ill have a 
telophone from the Brooklyn Bridge, 
Way out to Kalamazoo. 
I'll haue Chinese for rat catchers, 
Dr. Tanner fasting on roast lamb, 
I'll have three tnousand a 
year for drinking beer, 
When I'm the Alderman.

Your picture's near my heart. 
The little birds have gone to rest, 
And the moon is bright, my love, 
And the pretty stars are shining,

And from it they won't part, 
For they know that you love me, 
Your picture near my heart.

DON'T GO TO YOUR RELATIONS. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY FRANK LUM. 
We all hfet e 
our shares of ups and downs 
In every rank and station; 
We are sure to get more kicks and frowns, 
If we depend on kind relations. 
It's all very well once or twice to drop in, 
And ask for a 
lit.le in favor, 
But if by chance you go a 
third time, 
They'll construe it to your bad behavior 
CHORUS. 
So my advice take one and all, 
In every rank and station, 
And if you want a 
favor done, 
Don't go to your relations. 
I 
speak from experience, and some you'll find 
how often they'll invite you, 
But when poverty comes close behind, 
They will soon begin to slight you. 
It's clear away, there's a 
knock at the door, 
Don't open the door too wide John, 
I'm afraid it's that hungry brother of mine, 
Say I'm gone out for a 
ride, John. 
Choru& 
I 
thought ray sister would prove a 
friend, 
But soon she did deceive me, 
She said these times were not times to lend, 
She would if she could relieve me, 
A 
trifle sister, would keep me afloat. 
I 
shall sink if you don't arrange it. 
She said she'd no less than a 
five dollar note, 
And she hadn't time to change it. 
Chorus. 
I 
lost my goods but found that day, 
Though against me they had sinned all; 
Death called a 
rich old friend of mine, 
Who left me a 
handsome wind-fall. 
But how they altered what they said, 
Their ways were so provoking, 
To hear them say as they hung their heads, 
Why Frank we were only joking. 
Chorus 
There is none in this world so blessed as I, 
With so many kind relations, 
I 
am invited to breakfast, dinner, and tea, 
I've a 
hundred invitations. 
I 
refuse them all though my heart it burns, 
Their friendship I 
don't heed it, 
Por I 
hate the cold heart that in poverty spurns, 
!We only gives to those that don't need it. _Cho..

WHICH OF THE TWO. 
BY JERRY COHAN. 
SUNG BY ADA BURNETT. 
Copyright 1SS1 by Mrs. Pauline LIAM 
All rights reserved. 
Which of the two, rich or the poor, 
Will win in this race of life? 
When fortune leaves wealth at one man's door, 
At his neighbor's bestows toil and strife. 
Yet contentment may be the rich fruit of toil, 
While the wealth, yield but grief and dismay. 
And the bundle of riches we strive so to gain, 
May be gone in a 
single day. 
There are two pathways open for all men to tread, 
By the crooked and straight we must go; 
Choose early, choose right, ere your chances are dead, 
Choose carefully, which of the two. 
The beggar was sitting one day in the street, 
The day our Redeemer was born; 
Merry Christmas bells ringing, he'd nothing to eat 
For his family since yesterday morn. 
A 
woman of sin, passing, emptied her purse, 
Dropped her vail, to hide sympathy's tear; 
The next woman, a 
rich lady, passed into the church, 
Looking scorn on the miserable pair; 
I 
could not help thinking how our Saviour had died, 
To transform sinful sons, bright and new; 
The gilded, and real, stood exposed to me then, 
"Great Lord 1" I 
cried, which oi the two ?

Mary had a 
little corn, 
Upon her little toe, 
And everywhere that Nary went, 
That corn was sure to go. 
It followed her to jail, one day, 
For Mary she drank rum; 
And now she'll have a 
chance to pare her corn 
For thirty days to come. 
LITTLE WILLIE, 
Little Willie would read novels, 
And play hunter all the day; 
He wanted to be an Indian scout, 
No matter what you'd say. 
He bought him a 
little pistol, 
And put on his father's boots, 
And started for the western wild*, 
To hunt the savage Utes, 
No more he'll need the pistol, 
There's a 
wreath upon his brow; 
The Indian's went to his funeral, 
Little pants are vacant now.

When I 
was but sixteen, I 
thought, 
I'd no longer remain single, 
But take for better or for worse, 
A 
pan by the name of Jingle. 
Be was handsome, only twenty-one, 
With blue eyes and raven hair, 
I 
thought I'd done the thing, in fact, 
I 
was so happy I 
do declare. 
CHCRUS. 
It's all very well to married be, 
And think you'll live in clover; 
But it all depends on your husband dear, 
When the honeymoon is over, 
My husband he has put a ,stop 
To all joys that may be; 
While he flies out to visit round, 
I'm left, to nurse the baby. 
He thinks it is a 
woman's duty, 
To slave from morn till night, 
While he enjoys the pleasures of life, 
In a 
manner he thinks quite right. 
Chorus. 
Now sooner than be wnat I 
am, 
With every day a 
wrangle, 
By jove, I'd sooner single 
By turning round a 
mangle. 
So now, I've told you ladies all 
If you would live in clover, 
Pray get a 
husband who'll treat you right 
When the honeymoon is over.

bite of bread. 
Some tramps they beg from door to door, 
And they ask for charity. 
They say they've children ten at home, 
And they can't tupport their family, 
but place a 
nickle in their band, 
'10 some grog shop they will run, 
poor man's money they will tt.ke, 
And spend it all for ruin 
CHORUS. 
Now that's the kind that want, no work, 
For they're weak arid sick is their plea, 
When they get bread they'll thr,w it away 
From a 
wotkinginatC5 poor family. 
•Twas at an humble cot I 
called, 
And I 
rapded at the back door; 
A man asked me what would I 
have, 
I 
told him I 
was hungry and poor 
Said he come in and take a 
seat, 
" 
And he gave me bread and tea, 
Be wa a 
son of Erin's Isle, 
Toiling for his hinny. 
Cm:taus 
I 
shook his hand so hard and tough, 
And the tears rolled fast down my face, 
May Heaven protect his good family, 
For you're welcome always at hie plikoe,

THAT'S HOW YOU GET SERVED

One day in the street, I 
just happened to meet, 
An old friend whom I'd not seen for years, 
The old man was sad tho' to meet me was glad, 
And his eyes as we spoke filled with tears. 
I 
said, John, be brief, what's the cause of your grief ? 
To me your misfortunes unfold; 
Said he, in poor me, you a 
sample may see, 
Of how a 
man gets served when he's old. 
CHORUS. 
Each day growing older, I 
get the cold shoulder, 
By youngsters thrust out in the cold, 
Who jeeringly say, that I'm in the way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
When young I 
was praised, and my wages was raised, 
No labor then I 
evfar did shirk; 
And my master would then point me out to the men, 
As the one who best stuck to his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak, 
Unless it's to grumble or scold; 
They simply make fun of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you'ae old. 
Chorus. 
My wife poor soul she is nearly seventy-three, 
How to keep her from want I 
don't know; 
If I 
beg, I 
intrude, and by police are pursued, 
And if to the Commissioners of Charities we go, 
To seek for relief they but add to our grief, 
You must go to the Island we are told, 
Part husband from wife, to be paupers for life, 
Tilts how you get served when you're old. 
Chorus.

On that bright and shining shore, 
Just beyond the waters dark ; 
Watch for me, sweet angel ma, 
When the boatman lands his bark. 
Watch for me, for soon I'll come, 
With tha boatman pale and cold ; 
Watch to catch the first pale gleam 
Of the sails white fluttering fold! 
Bright and lovely is that land,

There upon that shining shore,

Wilt thou be so dazzling bright,

As we walk thro' the streets how often we meet, 
Some poor old man who's life is naught but woe; 
With age his form is bent, in his pockets not a 
cent, 
And for shelter he knows not where to go. 
With relations by the score who drive him from the door, 
And meet him on the street they pass him by, 
If you ask him why it's done, he will answer 
you and say, 
I 
am poor and old and only in the way. 
CHORUS. 
So let us cheer them on, they won't be with us long, 
Don't let us sneer because they're old and gray; 
And remember while we are young the days to 
us may Coma, 
When we'll pe old and only in the way. 
There was a 
time I 
hear when the young were 
not so queer, 
But since that time there's came an awful change, 
Young men in health and might, their old 
parents they will strike, 
It happens every day, it's nothing strange. 
When he his bread can't earn, his children do 
him spurs. 
For death I 
am sure he oftentimes does pray, 
Himself and faithful wife after toiling all their life, 
When old they find they're only in the way. 
Chic 
My little song I'm sure is for rich as well as poor, 
For take a 
rich man when he's growing old, 
His friends will shake his hand, his relations 
round him stand, 
Awaiting for him to die they want his gold. 
Then let us from this hour, do all that's in our power. 
To make the road for the old folks light and gay, 
And if they trouble on us cast, why let us be the last, 
To say when old that they are only in the way. 
Chorus.

Sure I 
thought I'd make a

So I 
am here to greet you all, 
And to thank ye for yere welcome to a 
stranger; 
I 
got a 
job of work, 
Since I 
landed in New York, 
But my work is attended with great danger, 
For a 
mason's clerk am I, 
One whose always climbing high, 
And the hod and ladder is my occupation; 
But for politics I'm bound, 
And I'm bound to get around, 
To assist in making laws for this great nation.

Paddy Duffy is my name,

Of a 
self-made, high-toned gentleman, you see! 
(Dance.) 
One day while on tile ladder, 
Oh! I 
never yet got madder, 
Then I 
did upon that very same occasion; 
Some bricks fell from my hod, 
And lit upon the nob 
Of a 
German peddlar of the Jew persuasion; 
Sheeney called hard names to Pat, 
For the bricks had broke his hat; 
I 
was angry, and the truth I 
had to tell, 
Oh ! sez I, you dirty Jew, 
But for your ancestors, like you, 
The Lord would be ali ye to-day, and doing well.

The old fashioned cottage, the place I 
loved so well, 
The spot where my mother and my father used to dwell, 
Oh! how often I 
have strolled thro' the fields of 
growing corn, 
near the old fashioned cottage, the place I 
was born. 
I 
remember the garden, the grove and the mill, 
And the little frame school house that 'stood on the hill, 
But with all its surroundings I 
loved none so well, 
As the old fashioned cottage where I 
once used to dwell. 
CHORUS. 
The old fashioned cottage, the place I 
was born, 
My home once so happy, has grown so forlorn, 
how I 
long to return to the home I 
love so well, 
The old fashioned cottage where I 
once used to dwell. 
I 
long to return to the cottage once again, 
To think of it fills my heart with sorrow and with pain, 
Many years now have passed since I 
left 
my dear old home, 
wander abroad thro this wide world to roam. 
ine spot has grown lonely that once was so bright, 
Where oft mother kissed her dear children good-nig 
Oh ! how merry the birds sang their sweet songs 
of yore, 
Asi they perch'd on the maple near the old cottage door.

jolly old woman from Ireland, 
My name it is Mrs. Magraw; 
I'm as happy as a

And for troubles I 
don't care a 
straw. 
From morning till night I

And so happy this minute I 
feel, 
If you'll just keep your seat for a 
minute, 
I'll dance you a 
bit of a 
reel.

And so happy this minute I

When first I 
came out to this country, 
Divil a 
one did I 
know; 
Without any friends or acquaintance, 
I 
had no idea where I 
should go. 
But I 
never let trifles annoy me, 
That's why I'm so happy and gay, 
And if you are in for amusement, 
You can bet I

Deep sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
For on this day my infant died, 
This day one year ago 
A tender bud so beautiful, 
So fragile pure and fair, 
Its fragrance for too s ea to waste 
On earth's bin-tain!ed air. 
Through many sad long hours of pais, 
My precious darling lay ; 
Then God in sweA compassion took, 
My little one away. 
As cold and rigid in my arms, 
His lifeless form was placed, 
Small agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced.

Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died one yell' ago, to-day,

bowed, 
To God's all- wise decree, 
He only took unto Himself 
The one lie gave to me. 
And yet I 
never sees babe, 
But sca'difig tears will start, 
And longly I 
crave to clasp 
My lost one to my heart. 
If I 
my f 
tture borne could choose, 
In realms where glory reigns, 
I'd ask to dwell with angel babes, 
Ever singing heavenly strains ; 
For sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
boron this day my baby died;

Blossom in the meadows, where I 
often stray 
To meet that little fairy that conies at close of day. 
How I

That my heart adores her, loves her more and more; 
I 
could ne'er deceive her, never cause her pain; 
Shades of evening hasten the meeting hour again.

Meet me in the twilight, close beside the rill, 
Tell me, little darling, that you love me still ! 
If you'll only promise, ever to be true, 
I'll pass the pleasant hours in happy dreams of you. 
And I 
love her fondly, more than words can tell, 
And I 
often linger in the quiet dell; 
Then my little fairy, like a 
brilliant beam, 
Will dawn upon my vision, just like a 
pleasant dream. 
In the rosy twilight, we often then will stray, 
And she listens to me, to each word I 
say; - 
And my vows are sacred, ever firm and true, 
Day and night I 
se thee, in happy dreams of you!

While jolly tars their love songs sing. 
The waves are calm, the sky is blue, 
We idly wait for foam capped swells, 
Ill comes the call of weary crew,

And then the merry tars we wake, 
Last watch on deck, eight bells, eight bells.

And bi ings us safe o'er foam- capped waves,

Come, oh 1 
eome to my home by the deep rolling sea, 
Where the fairest of pearls strew the shore, 
And the tides ebb and flow in their beauty and pride, 
While I 
wait for my bonnie Lenore. 
Then, oh! come to me, on the sands of the sea, 
Where the music of waves thrill the soul, 
I 
have built me a 
home where the foam caps may come, 
And the tempests grow fierce round my goal. 
CHORIN. 
Will you come to my home by the deep rolling sea, 
Where the fairest of shells strew the shore, 
I 
have built me a 
borne, where the foam caps may come, 
Will you come to my home by the sea. 
Come, oh ! come to my home by the deep rolling sea, 
Where the sunshine of life is so fair, 
And the waves throb with oain, then as calm as the heart, 
That would win thee such true love to share. 
Then come.at the dawn of the morning so bright, 
Or when sunbeams grow dim in the west, 
When the sweet strains are heard, as old ocean is stirred, 
By the tempest grown fierce on its breast. 
Chorus. 
Come, oh! come to my home By the deep rolling sea, 
11 here the pleasures of life may be found ; 
We will pick up the sbells which are strewn on the shoreq 
And we'll bathe in the waves dancing round. 
We'll speak words of love on the sands of the sea, 
And my home shall be thine evermore, 
When old ocean is stirred and sweet music is heard,

There is a 
little fellow, who no doubt you all have seen. 
And Charley is the charmer's Christian name; 
fle dresses in the fashion, with a 
bright neck-tie 
of green, 
And to tell the truth he never looks the same. 
jfis hair he curls quite nobby, and his moustache 
waxed to kill 
He's gotten up expressly for the day; 
lie stands upon the corners, but really can't keep still, 
And should you chance to meet him I 
am sure 
you'd say— 
CHORUS. 
Charley he's a 
masher, Charley he's a 
pet, 
harley he's a 
darling, he's a 
dandy you can bet; 
no's the object of attention from all the ladies fair, 
And when he's out on promenade you should 
see them at him stare. 
He attends all the theatres, and seems perfectly at home, 
Has invitations to the parties, balls, and fairs, 
He's a 
sort of privileged character and is always 
seen alone, 
He seems to run the gauntlet everywhere, 
lie's polished in his manner, in a 
la-de-da sort of way, 
But how he lives I'll leave it all to you, 
Yon couldn't help but notice him he always looks so gay, 
It's a 
mystery how they do it but they do.

Behold the Killarney Musketeers a 
walking 
down Broadway, 
With bayonets brightly glistening, and the band 
so gaily play,, 
They're the finest soldiers in the land, and of 
battle not afraid, 
And they show the people how they shine, 
when out on grand parade. 
See the stalwart officers, and privates in the rear, 
The captain he is urging on the men that know no fear; 
So let us join together now and give three hearty cheers, 
And raise it, too, for the boys in blue, the 
Killarney Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
All face about, all turn around, and raise your 
muskets from the ground, 
They marched away, so light and gay, with 
hearts that knew no fear, 
Three hundred solid Irish boys to protect their 
homes so dear; 
So let its join together now and give three hearty cheers, 
And raise it, too, for the boys in blue, the 
Killarney Musketeers. 
To-night, my boys, they're going to give a 
dashing fancy ball, 
Representing the American style up in McClellan Hall; 
The Skidmore's in full uniform, along with 
Brannigan's Band, 
The Sixty-Ninth and Musketeers will parade 
on the grand stand. 
The ladies waving American flags, 'twill be a 
grand display, 
Idingling with the dreamy waltz, enjoying a 
holiday; 
With boys so true, dressed up in blue, well 
give three hearty cheers, 
Yor the best parade that ever was made by the 
Killarney Musketeers.'

See how fast from Heaven, mother, 
Falls the feathery flakes of snow; 
Wearing white, and pure, a 
mantle 
For the fruitful earth below. 
Ere they melt, I 
leave you, mother, 
Leave for ever, this world of pain; 
For, something tells me, I 
shall never 
See the buttercups again. 
CHORUS. 
Do not weep, dear loving mother, 
Sad am I 
to cause you pain; 
But something tells me, I 
shall never 
See the buttercups again. 
How I 
loved alone to wander 
In the happy days long flown, 
O'er fields and meadows fair, to gather 
Bright-hued blossoms, freshly blown, 
Soon beyond the rippling river, 
Winding onwards o'er the plain; 
The buds may burst, but, I 
shall never 
Gather them for you again.

He don't seem to mind us at all; 
He says we're excited wid nothin' to fear, 
And takes the whole thing very small, 
If he don't drive that divil from out of the house, 
To give us some comfort instid, 
Some night in his shirt-tail we'll run him a

The man that lives ovei th e head.

THE DYING MINSTREL, 
COMPOSED AND RECITED BY WALTER mACX..

The curtain is up on the last act brother, 
I'm dying, I 
feel it here; 
We've had many a 
jaunt together, dear boy, 
But my next jaunt will be on a 
bier. 
Do you remember the night we opened in York, 
'Tis twelve years now or more; 
It was then I 
first saw her angel face, 
Since then my poor heart has grown sore. 
The overture passed off nightly, 
And our jokes were spicy and new, 
But I 
stuck that night in my. end song, 
For her eyes seemed to pierce me through; 
I 
was not in the after piece, so when I'd finished 
I 
washed up and went out in front, (my dam.; 
To see if I 
could again catch that glance, 
Well it was the same old story; 
You've been there I 
know it, dear boy, 
But you were accepted and happy, 
While I 
was forbidden that joy. 
A 
father, in the case " I 
should say so," 
lie called me a 
worthless adventurer, 
Said his daughter was high in the world, 
I 
only a 
poor nigger singer with unknown connecticeir 
Well, perhaps he was right, brother, 
But God will not make that distinctiou, 
I 
might have played the roll of Othello, 
Extolled my virtues and with eloquence won, 
But I 
did not tell that I 
once belonged to the ton. 
Raise the pillow a 
little higher, brother, 
That's better, I 
breath with more ease, 
I'm almost glad death is so near,, 
I 
almost welcome disease; 
Shakespeare says the whole world's a 
stage, 
I 
hope I've played my part well. 
The exit is near, the curtain is falling, 
I 
hear the prompters last bell, • 
Only a 
nigger minstrel, 
! 
how the words grate on my ear; 
Will the angels say them, too, and— 
For my sins not drop one tear; 
No, I'm sure they will not, 
I 
feel it here in my heart; 
I 
shall there meet my old friends, 
The minstrel boys ne'er again will peat

THE MAN THAT LIVES OVER MY HEAD 
RECITATION. 
BY WM. HARDMAN. 
oopyrigla 1881 by Mrs. Pauline Lir:der. 
I'm not much at singin' or makin' a 
speech, 
But seeing your faces so gay; 
And being requested I'll do what I 
can 
Before I 
have gone on me way. 
Of where I 
am livin' I'm goin' to speak, 
Or rather a 
neighbor instid; 
Who has the whole house in a 
terrible state, 
The man that lives over me head. 
I'm told that he sings for a 
livin' at night, 
In a big free and easy up town, 
To see him come home. I've watched many times, 
But always give up wid a 
frown, 
At three in the morning surrounded by friends, 
As weary I 
roll in me bed, 
He'll stand near the whadee and bawl like a 
cow, 
The man that lives over me head. 
Last night the whole house it was tilled full 
of smoke, 
I jumped from my bed like a 
deer: 
And found that the tenents were runnin' about, 
And raisin' the divil wid fear. 
I 
took matters easy and searched for the fire. 
Along wid a 
friend they call Red. 
And what do you think sure he upset the stove, 
Tke man that lives over in

On me to cast love's only shade;

She who promised that she'd ne'er forget me, 
Now claims another as her own.

Since childhood it has been my fortune, 
To always find my fondest hopes decay, 
ne'er met with any hope or treasure, 
But it would fade and pass away. 
Tho' twas hard to hear that she had wronged rae, 
Still my lot in life I

O'er the waves %, e

Down on Coney Island Beach.

O'er the waves we speed Away, 
Till we reach that isle of gladness, 
Which is just within our teach, 
Where we banish all our sadness, 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
In the chilling surf we shiver, 
But off hearts are light and free, 
While the wavelets dance and quiver, 
Rolling in from depths of sea. 
And the breeze is softly blowing, 
All our lonely ones tdiould teach, 
That the wise much bliss are knowing,

SAVE MY CHILD 
• 
Words by Dr. Theo. D. C. Miller, Music by W. Warren Bentley. 
When the Steamer Seawanhaka was burning, a 
mother steed 
amid the flames, clasping her little child with a 
dying grasp, and 
holding it over the vessels side as far from the flames as possible, 
though fatally burned and exhausted, and knowing that her last 
hour had come, she held her darling one, and in pleading accents 
cried, " Save my child !" 
One of tue heroes of that hour, and one 
whose deeds will not soon be forgotten. 
MR. JOHN HENRY 13IISH, of 
Harlem, N. Y. went to the relief of that agonized mother. Rowing 
his boat close to the vessels side, he succeeded in taking the child 
alive, from the dying grasp of the mother. 
His own person was 
Severely burned, and although suffering,- intensely, was able to res-
cue twenty-one others. 
The mother died immediately after her 
rescue, and her darling one in two weeks. 
What wonderful love 1.1 
& 
mother's love ! 
Copyright 1880 and published by Mrs Pauline Lieder. 
Save my child, for I 
am dying. 
Cried a 
mother, soft and low, 
Where the young and old were lying 
In that hour of gloom and woe. 
When Seawanhaka was burning, 
Drove its hundreds to the waves ; 
And that mother's heart was yearning

er the child her deep love saves 
CHORUS. 
Save my child, so low and thrilling, 
Came that plaintive cry again, 
As a 
hero brave and willing, 
Sought her side through fire and pain. 
As a

Sought her side through fire and pain, 
At the vessel's side she lingers, 
Robed in fierce and cruel flames,

Firmly all he fond heart claims. 
" 
Save lily child 1" if I 
must perish, 
For toy hour has come I 
know, 
But th's dear one you will cherish, 
Tell time, stranger, ere I

Fast the stringers boat is nearing,

Through the flames he r )ws naming, 
Though it seems an act so wild.

We're both growing aged together, 
And Jennie has left the old farm ; 
To walk by the side of another, 
As on in lifo's journey they roam, 
And John who was tender and loving, 
Has gone in the pathwhy to harm; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the tarm. 
CHORUS. 
It's sad to he aged and feeble, 
And know that this life has no charms. 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm. 
We thought John would be our proteetion, 
For he was so kind when a 
boy; 
And Betsey so gentle a: d 
Would call him a mother's fond joy. 
But he was led off by companions. 
In ways that bring evil and harm ; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
It's hard to he kveless and childless, 
When wrinkles are deep on the brow; 
And hairs has grown aged and whiten, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and helpless, 
With none to protect us from harm 
We only can suffer in silence, 
or 
tmirfuity mortgage the farm.

We never can contented be, 
With our own lot in life; 
We've always trouble on our mind, 
Some new born care or strife. 
Why not travel through the world 
With sunshine on your brow, 
For you'll never know the difference 
In a 
thousand years from now. 
CHORUS. 
Don't try to read the future, then, 
For this, and that, and how; 
For you'll never know the difference, 
In a 
thousand years from now. 
'Twon't do to be too proud these days, 
Because you have your wealth; 
You may some time the wrong man meet, 
And thereby lose your health. 
Don't scorn to earn your living, 
By the hoe, the spade, or plow; 
For you'll never know the difference 
In a 
thousand years from now. 
Chorus. 
Because your parents are well off, 
Don't scorn to learn a 
trade; 
Remember when the sun is warm, 
You can't always find the shade. 
Don't scorn to do a 
little work, 
Though sweat •tdorn your brow, 
For you'll never know the difference 
In a

As through life we journey onward, 
Queer sayings one hears, when traveling about; 
Some are odd, peculiar expressions, 
As " Put away the cradle baby's out." 
So now with your kind attention, 
I'll sing of the latest one to you; 
One that's sure to catch the fancy, 
And also become a 
popular one, too. 
Spoken.—You have heard all the expressions, 
" 
You're too fresh," " You're too new," etc, but 
the latest is— 
Cnouus. 
"Tie him up, my friend," tie him up, 
Tie him up, now mind what I 
say; 
You'll be sorry when you're sober, 
And your little spree is over, 
Tie him up, without any delay. 
This world is composed of all sorts of people, 
Who occupy different stations in life, 
The rich and the poor are mingled together, 
A 
living to gain in this sea of strife. 
It matters not where fortune may bring you, 
Slang phrases one hears from day to day; 
The old and the young the same it both pleases, 
As " I 
should remark," and " Nay, Gussie, nay." 
Spoken—Yes, one hears some very odd, peculiar 
expressions through travelling about, bicithI

I'm the maid that knows my business,

That in fashion's ways and flirting, 
Daughter had a

Was to be a 
star of fashion, 
And the charming up-town belle.-

I'm the star of fashion,

I'm a 
dashing maid of fashion, 
And for fortune's smiles Pgrieve; 
Only dresses that are finest, 
Doth my aching heart relieve. 
And to go to balls and parties, 
With the robes once worn before, 
Would be a 
gloom to all my sunshine, 
I 
could be a 
belle no more. 
I'm n

Just the maid who knows her place, 
Yon will find me kind and loving,

She will call my style perfection,

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worm soft is sleeping, 
And the blight stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the deli, 
Hushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rides the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
Blithely in the early morning, 
Summer (1(v is gently dawning, 
Lifting night's be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one bestowing, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life be pure, 
slay her sweetness never fade, 
May grim sorrow ne'er secure, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
Bear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing, 
Little roguish eyes.

Yon may think that I 
am mad, 
But I 
only feel so sad, 
The reason I 
will tell you every one ; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, 
Whose name was Peggy Doyle, 
And j 
brought her to Coney Isle to have some fink. 
She is from the County Down, 
And she weighed two hundred pound, 
And I 
thought that she'd be true to um all the was. 
But if I 
had to do it again, 
Sims would never go to swim 
Along with me down to Coney Isle. 
CHORUS. 
She had salt water sure, galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile, 
They all did wave their hats, 
And shouted ".aoat her pat," 
The day I 
brought my Peg to Coney Isle. 
Fow its when we reached the pier, 
We went and had some beer, 
And after that we went and had a 
bathe, 
You may talk about your fat woman 
That traveled with liarnum'a show, 
But you ought to see my Peg upon the waves. 
The gang c 
Immenced to guy us, 
My bosom was on fire, 
When the gang gave to me a 
grand hurray, 
W 
hen a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth, 
, 
" 
Beheave us" shouted out, (
Chorus 
There's one of the sea lions that escaped the other day. 
Of course I 
did feel mad, after listening to that lad, 
Of course he thought that he was awful smart, 
But if I 
had him in New York 
Up near the Central Park, 
You tau bet your life that I 
would break his heart, 
I 
don't say I'm a 
fighter, a 
cutter qr a 
biter 
but I 
can talc.) my own part all the while. 
Arrah-tnusha bad luck to Peg, she will stand 
upon her head, 
Badore I 
bring her again to Coney Isle.
