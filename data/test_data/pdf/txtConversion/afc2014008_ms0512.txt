A Few Personal Thoughts on Public Sector I
'olklile Work
 
The entire field f
lf public sector folklife has grown by leaps
 
and bounds during the last decade.
 The most visible growth has
 
occurred at the federal  level  (NEA,  NhII,  Smithsonian,  Library of
 
Congress)  and in the proliferation of state folk cultural  programs
 
(which will soon number over forty),  but municipal agencies,
 
museums,  libraries,  historical societies and other public institutions
 
have also experienced new and increased public folklife programming.
 
This past decade might be called the "Legitimizing" decade.
 
With emphasis on products and presentation, we have all tried,  and
 
succeeded by-and-large,  to legitimize folk cultural expression
 
within that larger realm of cultural expression.
 The films,
 
festivals,  and exhibits have been directed primarily,  though not
 
exclusively,  at  audiences whose cultural backgrounds are different
 
than those of the cultures being presented.
 With aims of
 
legitimizing minority cultural expressions, we have brought these
 
expressions,  in attractive gift-wrapped packages,  to ,mainstream
 
America.  [Perhaps we'll reverse that process at some point and
 
present the Dothan Country Club's Tuesday afternoon Iridge club
 
to the members of the Greater Old Salem Baptist Church in Rocky
 
Head,  Alabama on a fifth Sunday afternoon  (fifth Sunday,  of
 
course, because nothing else will be going on).)
 
All these films,  festivals,  exhibits and other pretty packages
 
have served, and,  indeed shall continue to serve,  a very  important
 
function.
 When presented with sensitivity and dignity, these
 
packages do serve to legitimize cultural expressions of great
 
beauty and power.
 
1
 
2
 
M
 
During this decade of presentation and legitimizaLlon we have
 
struggled with questions of cultural manipulation.
 Of course we
 
are manipulating culture,  as is McDonalds,  cable television, welfare,
 
and the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway.
 We are supposedly trained
 
(indeed, more highly trained, on the average, than most_cultural
 
workers) to locate,  identify,  and work with traditional  cultural
 
expressions.
 We are cultural brokers.
 
As we enter this next decade I would hope that we take this
 
duty of cultural brokering in all its implicit seriousness.
 
As the field of public sector folklife continues to grow and
 
mature,  I feel we need to redirect our attention away from the
 
product and the presentation toward the community and individual
 
(the constituents).
 
I see a real problem with conferences and workshops that
 
address themselves to such topics as "Archiving," "Regional Folklife
 
Projects," "Media Production."
 I
'm afraid public sector folklife
 
has become too product oriented;  indeed we seem to place more
 
emphasis and attention on the product  (film,  festival,  exhibit)
 
than we do on the community or individual.
 I fear that we too
 
often view the product as an end goal rather than as a tool toward
 
achieving a more abstract goal.
 
As public sector folklorists our constituency is defined
 
quite clearly as those folk practitioners from diverse cultural
 
and ethnic backgrounds whose cultural expressions help define
 
their community's worldview.
 Our function should be,  quite
 
simply, to service the needs of that constituent group.
 Our
 
primary role should be neither documentation nor preservation,
 
but rather advocacy.
 
3.
 
I
' m afraid public sector folklorists have been too timid in
 
pursuit of an activist-
.role.
 Other arts administrators have not.
 
The visual arts administrator,  for instance,  does not limit his
 
work to documenting and presenting the visual arts of his region.
 
He,  instead,  acts as a visual artists advocate,  providing services,
 
exhibition opportunities,  facililating commissions,  helping
 
provide legal services,  economic opportunities,  and all the while
 
trying to educate the public -'
toward an understanding of the artist
 
and his work while allowing the artist to maintain his creative
 
integrity.
 Similar is the case of the dance administrator, media
 
arts administrator,  etc.
 They work to help provide a social,
 
cultural,  and economic atmosphere that will  allow artists to
 
work,  create,  and evolve.
 
Such,  perhaps,  should be the role of the public sector
 
folklorist.
 The difference between the folk arts administrator
 
and the visual arts administrator is that one deals with community
 
aesthetic expression where the other deals with individual aesthetic
 
expression.
 But that  is the only difference.
 The folk arts
 
administrator can still pursue a constituent-oriented program,
 
acting as advocate to traditional communities helping to provide
 
those communities with the same access to public money and services
 
that is provided to other arts constituencies,  and facilitating
 
the creation of a social,  cultural,  and economic atmosphere that
 
will allow traditional expression to thrive,  change, or disappear
 
according to the needs, will,  and desires of the community.
 
Legitimization must be a continuing process,  and products
 
(films, festivals,  exhibits,  etc.)  are often the most effective
 
-
services we can provide to traditional communities;  but,  at the
 
same time,  with the degree of legitimization we have thusfar
 
1
1
 
a chieved,  I feel its'  time for us to shed that certain self-consciousness
 
and timidity that has characterized much of our work and assume a bolder
 
posture of cultural activism as advocates to traditional communities.

Introduction 
In  1966 the first state folklorist position was created in Pennsylvania.
 
There were no additional positions created for the next eight years.
 
In 1974, National Endowment for the Arts-supported positions were created
 
in Maryland and Tennessee,  and,  since that time,  there has been a rapid
 
growth in state folk cultural programs.
 
At present there are state folk cultural programs  in over forty states,
 
with another half dozen or so states at various stages  in the development
 
of such programs.
 The vast majority of those programs were initially
 
established through matching funds provided by the Folk Arts Program of
 
the National Endowment for the Arts.
 
In 1978 Charles Camp,  of the Maryland Arts Council,  conducted a survey
 
of the eight state folk cultural programs that were then  in existence.
 
There was no follow-up survey until  1984 when the Public Programs
 
Section of the American Folklore Society conducted a survey of the
 
thirty-five programs that were  in existence  in that year.
 This survey
 
is  intended as a follow-up to the 1984  study,  and is designed to provide
 
basic data on funding,  programming activities and evaluation of current
 
state folk cultural programs to the National Endowment for the Arts,
 
the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies,  the American Folklore
 
Society,  arts administrators and folklorists.
 
Summary Report 
4
 
In the last decade the number of state folk cultural programs has grown
 
from less than half a dozen to over forty.
 With few exceptions these
 
programs have become an  integral and permanent component of their host
 
agencies'  total range of programs.
 The state arts agency is the typical
 
home for a state folk cultural program,  but other agencies of state
 
government,  including state historical commissions and state universities,
 
have also sustained state folk cultural programs.
 
Despite the rapid growth in the number of programs,  the calibre of
 
professional training remains high.
 The average coordinator has
 
completed coursework toward the Ph.D.
 Nearly 94% of the coordinators
 
hold advanced degrees;  nearly 44% hold Ph.Ds.
 
Most coordinators have been on the job for a relatively short period
 
of time,  the average 3.3 years,  up from 2.5 years  in 1983.
 There does
 
not appear to be much job movement,  and the low rate of longevity un-
doubtedly reflects the fact that many of the programs are new.
 
Average salary for state folk cultural coordinators  is between $22,500.
 
and $25,000.  per year,  up $2,500.  in two years.
 
The average coordinator  is assisted by less than one  (
.75)  employee
 
and one  intern/volunteer  in an agency that averages 24 employees,
 
meaning that the average state folk cultural program makes up 7% of
 
its agency's total workforce.
 
The positions are supported with combinations of federal and state funds.
 
At present 26% of position support comes from federal sources,  69%  from
 
state sources.
 For those positions  in existence since 1981 their position
 
support from federal sources has declined from 39%  in 1981 to 7%  in 1985.
 
Those agencies which have state folk cultural programs devoted an average
 
of  12% of their total budgets,  or approximately $4,000,000.  to their folk
 
cultural programs.
 Of that $4,000,000.,  approximately half that amount
 
was awarded  in grants to other  local organizations/individuals.
 17% of
 
that money awarded in grants came from federal sources,  80%  from state
 
sources.
 17% of those grants were awarded to individual  folk artists,
 
83% to organizations,  as compared to their host agencies'  total grant
 
activity with 5% going to individuals and 95% to organizations.
 
The average folk cultural coordinator devotes  18% of his time toward
 
grants administration,  41% toward projects,  20%  toward technical services
 
and 19% toward non-folk cultural activities.
 
There  is a wide range of folk cultural activities with which folk
 
cultural coordinators  involve themselves.
 Most typical are apprenticeship
 
programs,  concerts production,  exhibitions,  festivals production,  folk
 
artists-in-education programs,  public lectures,  archives,  exhibition
 
catalog production,  field research,  audio and video productions,  con-
sultation,  curriculum development,  publications and field surveys.
 
Although state folk cultural programs remain a relatively small component
 
within their agencies'  total range of programs,  it appears that they are
 
becoming a permanent and sustained part of the agencies'  total cultural
 
mission.
 Since  1981,  those state agencies which maintain folk cultural
 
Irograms are demonstrating an  increasing commitment of state resources
 
toward providing a vast array of programs and services to their states'
 
traditional folk cultures.

questionnaire,  twenty-five are attached to state arts agencies.
 Of
 
the remaining nine,  two are attached to state universities,  three to
 
state historical agencies,  one to a state center for the arts,  one  is

cultural programs,  these programs are maintaining a high level of
 
academic training.
 Among the thirty-two state folk cultural program
 
coordinators responding,  fourteen hold Ph.D.  degrees.

Among those same thirty-two respondents,  the average number of years
 
on the job is 3.3 years,  up from 2.5 years in a similar survey conducted
 
in 1984.
 Three respondents have been in their positions for more than
 
seven years,  while nine have been in their current position two years
 
or less.
 
The average salary of state folk cultural programs coordinators is
 
between $22,500.  and $25,000.  per year.
 The salaries range from just
 
over $15,000./year to over $35,000./year.

The average number of employees  in those agencies to which state
 
folk cultural programs are attached is twenty-four.
 The average
 
state folk cultural program coordinator  is assisted by less than
 
one  (
.75)  employee and one intern/volunteer.
 
Positions Funding
  
While eleven of twenty-nine state folk cultural coordinator positions
 
received no federal funding in  1984,  the majority of the positions were
 
funded with a combination of state and federal funds.
 Significantly,
 
the percent of position support coming from federal sources declined
 
from 34%  in 1983* to 26%  in  1984,  while the percent of position support
 
from state sources rose from 64% to 69%.
 Private sources of position
 
support rose from 2% to 5%.
 For those programs  in existence in 1981,
 
their percentage of federal support has dropped from 39%  in 1981 to 7%
 
in 1984,  while state support has risen from 60% to 89%.
 State agencies
 
are continuing to assume  increasing financial responsibility for their
 
state folk cultural programs.

Thirty-one state folk cultural programs spent a total amount of $3,918,615.
 
on folk cultural programming  in 1984.
 That amount represented 3.5% of
 
their agencies'  total expenditures of $111,220,717.
 However,  when one
 
accounts for some larger agencies spending a smaller percentage of budget
 
on folk cultural programming and some smaller agencies spending a larger
 
percentage on such programming,  the average agency spent  12% of  its total
 
budget on folk cultural programming.
 When one considers only those folk
 
cultural programs based in state arts agencies,  the average percentage
 
of budget devoted to folk cultural programming is  5.7%.

They were then asked to indicate how they would  ideally like to divide
 
their work time.
 The responses indicate that folk cultural coordinators
 
are
 spending an increasing amount of time on non-folk cultural activities
 
while they would like to be spending less time on such activities.
 There
 
seems to be an  indication that they would like to be devoting more time
 
to projects and technical services.

Some programs devote most of their energies toward grants to local organizations i

state.  Others devote all their e
fforts toward projects administered by t
