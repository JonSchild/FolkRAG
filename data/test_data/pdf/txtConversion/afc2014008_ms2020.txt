Some years ago when I was teaching in a west coast university
 
I had the pleasure of having in one of my c
lasses a woman exchange student
 
from Swaziland.  Swaziland is a tiny independent kingdom in the far northeast
 
quadrant of South Africa, actually entirely surrounded by South Africa, without
 
even an outlet to the nearby Indian Ocean.  One can only marvel over the
 
steadfast social solidarity that must have developed over the centuries in order
 
to preserve and protect this tiny gleam of hope, this small i
sland of independence

Did you wear it perhaps in your hair?  Sew it on to a skirt?  Hang it on the

I suddenly realized I didn't really know if Swazis mostly
 
2
 
l
ived in huts without exactly having walls, or even if they generally used
 
tables on which objects might be displayed.  I am forever being confronted
 
by my own profound ignorance.)  Anyway, she said, "Oh no.  We make these to
 
put over the tops of water or milk jars to keep the f
lies and l
ittle bugs
 
out.  But I think theytre
 pretty too."
 
And I thought the one she gave me was beautiful.  And I thought
 
it was also humbling and worthy of great respect.  It made me marvel all over
 
again at the universality of the human impulse to go -
-
 as the title of a
 
famoii2s art folk art exhibit once put it -
-
 "beyond necessity".  Keeping the
 
flies out of a milk jug, after all, is a goal that can reasonably be accomplished
 
by any number of available objects -
-
 a leaf, a palm frond, a wood chip, a piece
 
of bark, even a stone.  Or, moving to man-made objects, a scrap of cloth, a
 
saucer or a pot l
id -
-
 any-1 number  of things would do.  If that was all you
 
wanted to do.  Keep out the flies.
 
Really, something e
lse must have been going on here.  The Swazi
 
lady or gentleman who knotted that web of green thread and white beads together
 
so precisely and so neatly
 I don't believe was thinking about flies, or even
 
sanitation, as noble a cause as that is anywhere in the world.  He or she was
 
making a thing of beauty -
-
 a special thing, by the way, of Swazi beauty as
 
opposed to Roumanian beauty or Afrikaans beauty.  But I doubt they were thinking
 
in those terms either.  What they were doing -
-
 those Swazi makers -
-
 wa 4laking
 
their l
ives more beautiful, more l
iveable, more Sw zi-like.  They were making
 
their surroundings more apprèpriate for a proper Swazi to exist in, and,
 
incidentally, they were taking good care that the flies didn't get into the milk.
 
Most of us, I believe, tend to think of the decorative impulse
 
as frivolous, something you allow only after the t
03L hard, real problems have
 
been met; indeed, we actually think of,it as 1
1beyo
 necessity".  We might do
 
well to consider the possibility that decoration, the creation of beauty 
)*NO W

itself i
s anecessity, that i
t is one of the ways, indeed, of meeting the
 
I
 
tough, hard,real problems that beset us.
 
f
i4  d
.
., 1i 'e ubiquity of decoration
 
and display amongst all the peoples of the world, no matter how hard-pressed
 
or impoverished, suggests that the decorative impulse may well be actually
 
l
ife-preserving, e
ssential to human survival.
 
I myself tend to believe that decoration has profoundly to do
 
with morale, and that morale i
s e
ssential for human movement of any kind, and
 
that that's the way it all works together.  You have to have your mzxmz nerve up
 
to create anything, to make anything happen.  Even just to get through the day
 
in one piece, you have to have somewhere to start from, some center of calm,
 
a conviction that this i
s what you do first and then that, and you do it this way
 
because i
t i
s the proper way or the best way or just the way.  That's what morale
 
i
s:  as Websters puts i
t -
-
 the mental or emotional condition of confidence, enthusia l
 
or l
oyalty with regard to the function or tasks at hand.
 
My morale is high this morning because I have just seen this
 
beautiful exhibit of Craft and Community: Traditional Arts in Contemporary Spciety;
 
and I am in the presence of many other people who, l
ike me, care for and revere
 
the work of the human hand; and so the morale of everybody here,- I expect, is
 
pretty high th13
 
m
o
i
-iing.  Consider, on the other hand, how we would feel if the
 
exhibit had not been carefully conceived and beautifully mounted, if the objects
 
displayed had been carelessly or unskillfully made, if the catalogue had not
 
contained such splendid photographs and interesting e
ssays -
-
 if the proper
 
decoration of the total effort had not taken place, if the condition of beyond  
necessity had not been reached.
 
So you see, though I thought it might be amusing for you to
 
imagine yourself in Swaziland for a few minutes this morning, what I really have
 
been talking about all along surrounds us in the Balch Institute today, and through-
out the state of Pennsylvania, yesterday, today, and tomorrow.  It i
s a common
 
4
 
condition.  Some think of handicr
s a
s just sentimental l
umber from the past.
 
On the c
ontrary, they are absolutely of the present.  They are l
ively and
 
v
ibrant and changing, and they are s
ocially e
ncouraged i
n a
ll k
inds of interesting
 
and d
ifferent ways.

F
or the critical factor a
bout the tiditional crafts we see i
n
 
this e
xhibit (
just l
ike the Swazi f jar cover) i
s t
rat the work of beauty goes
 
on within a s
hared concept of a particular kind of beauty, s
o that the knowledgable
 
and talented maker knows she i
s not only pleasing herself but a
ll t
he o
ther
 
count
 
people who "
truly
 sj*, the other people l
ike her, the people who prize the
 
particular tradition within which she works.  There are many beautiful ways to
 
cover a jar, but the Swaziway i
s outstanding partly i
n i
ts difference from the
 
E
skimo way or t
he Appalachian way.
 
I
t i
s the aesthetic philosophy, the s
tyle, that endures -
-
 the
 
palette of c
olors, the range of possible shapes, the choice of materials, the
 
desire f
or precision or perhaps for spontaneity, for weightiness or perhaps f
or
 
weightlessness -
-
 a
ll the myriad decisions that have been made for us by earlier
 
generations of makers and doers, s
o that we can devote ourselves t
o the mastery
 
5
 
of the particular: the UkranIan Hutsul egg writing perhaps, or Puerto Rican
 
cuatros.  Don't rely on function -
-
 that changes all the time.  Note, for example,
 
that my Swazi jar cover was presented to me not as a jar cover but as a
 
ceremonial gift and that its function has changed once more since I received it.
 
It's now an object of household decor, and it l
ies on top of a l
ow bookcase where
 
I can admire it often.
 
I
,
 
 
u &
 
Of course I have to qualify that.  You have to watch out for
 
function, you can't real y ignore it.  It is one of the important factors that
 
come to bear on the processes of making things.  A major change tkzx in function
 
that endures through time may e entua1ly be reflected in changes in the !ualities
 
of an object.  If you can easily and cheaply get hold of a bucket, for example, you
 
may no longer need to weave baskets out of such finely split fibers and with
 
such extreme tightness that they can actually hold water, as many Alaskan Americans
 
used to do.  But the beauty of Tlingit basketry i
s still expressed through the
 
aesthetic stability of their weaving style: that it emphasizes tightness of weave,
 
fineness of materials and symmetry of design.  It will take a long l
ong time for
 
those qualities to change, even though the circumstances that made them necessary
 
no longer pxzx pertain.  And I
'm glad &
L* LU
 There is a delicate balance that
 
needs to prevail in aesthetic matters so that, with some people pushing for
 
change and others hooraying for stability, the future sort of wobbles towards us
 
*kther than coming on l
ike a speeding bullet.  Thank goodness.  Let some of the
 
other people in the world make lacy baskets all full of holes and airiness.  There
 
is no single language of beauty.
 •
 
And this is, I believe, one of the most important lessons we can
 
learn from a careful and serious inspection of this exhibit.  Not only are there
 
many kinds of beauty expressed in the different objects displayed here, it i
s
 
1
'
 
plain that they co-exist in a kind of friendly neutrality and that they have
 
SO CO-existed for a long time,  They have been neighbors, and, l
ike neighbors,

they are d

the single work of beauty and affection
 
by a single maker working within an established tradition he cared about carries
 
a real balm for the over-taxed spirit.
 
For the critical factor about the traditional crafts we see in
 
this exhibit (
just l

s
 
plain that they co-exist in a kind of friendly neutrality and that they have
 
so co-existed for a l
ong time.  They have been neighbors, and, l
ike neighbors,
 
6
 
they are different one from the other.  You know, we do l
earn from our neighbors
 
and we even borrow our neighbors' ideas if we l
ike them, but another big part
 
of what we learn over time i
s what our neighbors are l
ike, what and who they are,
 
how they differ from us, how nice it must be to be them, how nice it i
s not to
 
be them too.  In a period when we are continually bombarded by conscience-less
 
market-driven images designed to do only one thing: sell everybody on the same
 
commodity, whether it be a new president or a used car, we must strive with all
 
our might to retain and preserve the honest humanity of honest human differences.
 
I
'd l
ike to c
lose by congratulating the many many people who
 
organized this exhibition, who did the preliminary field work, chose the objects,
 
arranged for their display here, who went through all the a izing details of
 
setting up the cases, agreeing to the order of display, writing the labels, putting
 
together the catalogue, calling the conference, arranging for the speakers -
-
 I
 
know some of them personally but I don't know everybody, so I will mention no names,
 
lest I inadvertently leave someone out.  I congratulate them all and I thank them
 
all.  I thank also the artists, those who are here this morning and those who are

A number of years ago when  I was teaching in a west
 
coast university,  I had the pleasure of having in one of my
 
classes a woman exchange student  from Swaziland.  Swaziland is
 
a tiny independent kingdom in the far northeast quadrant of
 
the Union of South Africa,  actually entirely surrounded by
 
South Africa,  without even an outlet to the  Indian Ocean.  One
 
can only marvel at the steadfast  social solidarity that must
 
have developed over the centuries  in order that this small
 
island of independence and cultural autonomy could survive
 
inside the bleak and oppressive political landscape of the
 
surrounding Union of South Africa.
 
My Swazi  student told me many things about her country,  but
 
one of the most wonderful  seemed to me how they crown
 a new
 
king -
-
 and this had occurred when she was  in residence there
 
a couple of years before.  Before the ceremony,  every single
 
Swazi  in the entire nation-- and there are some 800,000 of
 
them  : men,  women,  children,  babes in arms -
-
 contributes a
 
small article of clothing that they have worn or touched:
 a
 
handerchief,  a sock,  a bit of ribbon,  something like that.
 
All these bits  of garments are then gathered into an enormous
 
bundle -
-
 remember,  one from every person in the entire
 
country -
-
 and placed on and around the throne.  And when the
 
King is crowned,  he
 sits on his throne for the rest of the
 
ceremonies  literally supported and buoyed up and cushioned by
 
all his people.  It must make him feel absolutely wonderful.
 
What a symbol;  no wonder they' ve been able to hold together.
 
Now before she  left to return to her homeland,  my Swazi
 
friend gave me a little present -
-
 a sort of round lacy
 
object made of thin bright green cord and white seed beads
 
woven together in interlocking flower-like shapes.  It is
 
perhaps  5 or  6 inches  in diameter,  about the size of a large
 
saucer -
-
 very delicate,  fresh and original.  In the United
 
States,  one might call it  something like a doily,  but the
 
beads seemed to take  it out of that category,  and I didn't
 
know quite what  it was.
 
Anyway,  I admired it and somewhat hesitantly finally asked
 
her what you did with such a delightful bit of cobweb in
 
Swaziland.  Did you perhaps wear it in your hair? Sew it on to
 
a skirt?
 Hang it on the wall or lay it on a table for a
 
decoration?  (
I  suddenly realized I didn't really know if
 
Swazis mostly lived in huts these days without exactly having
 
walls,  or even if tables where objects might be displayed
 
were in wide use.  I am forever being confronted by my own
 
profound ignorance.)  She said,  "Oh no,  We make these to put
 
over the tops of water or milk  jars to keep the flies and
 
little bugs out.  But  I think they' re pretty too."
 
And I thought the one  she gave me was beautiful.
 And I
 
thought  it was also humbling and worthy of great  respect.  It
 
made me marvel all over again at the universality of the
 
human impulse to go -
-
 as the title of a famous  folk art
 
exhibit once put  it -
-
 "beyond necessity".  Keeping the  flies
 
out of a milk  jar,  after all,  is a goal that can reasonably
 
be accomplished by any number of easily available objects -
 a
 
leaf,  a palm frond,  a wood chip,  a piece of bark,  even a
 
stone.  Or -
-
 moving to man-made objects -
-
 a scrap of cloth,
 
a saucer or a pot  lid -
-
 any number of things would do.  If
 
that was all you wanted to do.  Keep out the  flies.
 
Really,  something else must have been going on here.  The
 
Swazi lady or gentleman who knotted that web of green thread
 
and white beads together so precisely and so neatly I don't
 
believe was thinking about  flies,  or even sanitation,  as
 
noble a cause as that  is anywhere in the world.  He or she was
 
making a thing of beauty -
-
 a special thing,  by the way,  of
 
Swazi beauty as distinct  from Roumanian or Navajo beauty.
 
But personally I don't even know if they were thinking in
 
those terms either.  What they were doing -
-
 those Swazi
 
makers -
-
 was making their lives more beautiful,  more
 
liveable,  more Swazi-like.  They were making their
 
surroundings more appropriate for a proper Swazi to exist  in;
 
and,  incidentally,  they were taking good care that the  flies
 
didn't get  into the milk.
 
Most of us,  I believe,  tend to think of the decorative
 
impulse as  something you can allow to surface only after the
 
tough,  hard,  rcal problems have been taken care of;  in terms
 
of our Puritain heritage the making of art  is
 a sadly
 
frivolous activity.  But this also implies that there is an
 
intrinsic two-step process  for creation:  you get your thing
 
or idea or proposal to take care of an ongoing problem all
 
laid out and then you slather art on and around it like
 
frosting on a cake.  "Just a spoonful of sugar makes the
 
medicine go down."  I am exaggerating here,  of course,  to make
 
my point but not really all that much.  Art,  in American
 
society does  seem to be thought of as existing independently
 
of anything else,  not  relating to anything else -
-
 certainly
 
not to government or economics or anything really important.
 
But although most of us think of art this way,  as operating
 
outside and independent  from other parts of our society most
 
of the time when we look closely our systems turn out to be
 
all of a piece.  Let me give you an example;  I
' ve told it
 
before,  but  it's  still useful.
 
Just over to the west of here in the state of Arizona a few
 
years back,  Jim Griffith,  a local folklorist,  noted that the
 
very hottest,  most creative pinata maker in town had been
 
turning out awfully uncharacteristic pinatas -
-
 all white and
 
baby blue and pale pale pink.  Now this artist was  so highly
 
thought of in Tucson that the University of Arizona football
 
team had several times commissioned him to make mammoth
 
pinatas of the Wildcats or the Roadrunners--whatever their
 
emblem was-- and those pinatas had ridden in honor in the
 
victory parades.
 
Now Jim was a bit disturbed by this shift in aesthetic
 
sensibilities  for it turned out that other local pinata
 
makers were also abandoning their usual palettes of electric
 
blue,  scarlet,  lime green,  and t
-  ---
-cjal  shade
.
  
-that 4
48
emba ra
 xy youth as
 
 
 pink"
 be
 
Anyway,
 
everybody was going absolutely and uncharacteristically
 
pastel all of a sudden,  and Jim got really curious as to what
 
on earth was going on,  what  factors had stimulated this
 
really major aesthetic shift-- was  it a kind of art nouveau
 
idea coming up north from Mexico,  was  it some sort of attempt
 
to imitate another possibly more glamorous aesthetic,  had the
 
art teachers with their color wheels gotten in there and
 
persuaded the pinata makers to work for gentler more melding
 
effects  instead of looking across the color spectrum for
 
brilliance and contrast?
 
The answer turned out to be pretty simple -
-
 awful,  but
 
simple.  The paper company that serviced almost all of the
 
state of Arizona had determined that the major tissue papers
 
that were being bought  in bulk across the state were light-
colored;  department and gift stores everywhere
 
pale blue,  and pale pink tissues to wrap their
 
and they were the big-time quantity consumers.
 
used white,
 
merchandise in
 
The sales of
 
burnt orange,  emerald,  crimson,  aquamarine,  royal purple
 
tissue papers were negligible by contrast,  so-- well,  it was
 
a good hard business problem and a good hard business
 
decision got made.  No more bright colored tissue paper;  we
 
can't afford it;  it doesn't make a dime.  Now,  just for a
 
moment,  let us together look privately into our own silent
 
art-loving and profit-loving hearts and think,  if I were a
 
big-time paper manufacturer, and times were hard,  what would I
 
have done?
 
Weill,  what Jim Griffith did,  not being a paper manufacturer
 
but a practical man and a first-class folklorist was to
 
stockpile in his own private closet in his own private
 
living room a number of industrial sized rolls of a full
 
range of brilliant color-soaked tissue papers. And any pinata
 
maker in southern Arizona could come by and quietly take off
 
a yard or a mile or two as needed of any of the colors
 
according to his own aesthetic taste.And what do you know -
-
things  just began to sort of subside back to normal;  there
 
were
 fewer and fewer white or pastel pinatas and more and
 
more lively multi-colored one and pretty soon everybody had
 
forgotten about the great southern Arizona color change.  But
 
what I
. learned from it is that our system is a very powerful
 
and integrated system
 and it works all of a piece and what
 
happens here affects what
 
how many thousand similar
 
every day in thousands of
 
happens there.  And I thought of
 
tiny dramas are being acted out
 
different subtly injurious ways in
 
thousands of American places.  And I began to believe we of
 
the arts world must reflect together more frequently and in
 
greater depth on how we might mitigate the massive forces in
 
our nation that grind away steadily and often unconsciously
 
towards towards artistic conformity and cultural uniformity

And I am glad it will take a long time.
There is a
 
delicate balance that needs to maintain in aesthetic matters
 
L.
iWl
- with some people on one side  (
usually the young
 
ones)  pushing for change and other people on the other side
 
(usually the older ones)  hooraying for stability,  the future
 
kind of wobbles towards us rather than coming on like a
 
speeding bullet.
 Thank goodness.  Let  some of the other
 
people in the world go make lacy baskets all  full of holes
 
and airiness.
 Let  some others make kind of middle-of-the-
road weaves,  even and regular and stout.
 
And let some people do like  I saw a Samoan lady do at a
 
farmers market  in Pago Pago once.  She had two toddlerw with
 
her and she had finished her shopping,  putting her vegetables
 
and fish into a bag she carried over her shoulder.
 Her last
 
purchase was  four coconuts,  and her bag was  full.
 She picked
 
them up and balanced them in her arms,  but one of the
 
children wanted his hand held and the other began to wail to
 
be carried.  So she went over to the side of the road,  put
 
everything down,  got the children started digging holes with
 
a stick,  pulled a green frond off a nearby palmetto,  sat
 
down,  and made herself a basket,  It took her six,  maybe seven
 
minutes.  I don't know if it was the most elegant basket  in
 
the world but  it was even and it had a handle she coule put
 
over her arm and it was  strong and it held four coconuts and
 
off she went.  And I was thunderstruck -
 there simply could
 
not have been a more appropriate,  more sensitively conceived,
 
more Samoan,  more all-round just right basket for the moment.
 
And in that  sense it was perfectly beautiful,  There is no
 
single language of beauty.
 
For art  isn't an extra bit of decoration you tack on to
 
something else.  It  is an intrinsic part of every culture
 
group,  moving and changing with the times,  and it  is a
  
universal. Think about what that might mean:  that the
 
creation of art might of itself be a necessity,  that  it may
 
well be one of the most thoroughly-tested,  pan-human ways of
 
addressing the tough,  hard,  real problems that beset us.  The
 
simple universality of decoration and display amongst all the
 
peoples of the world suggests that the aesthetic  impulse may
 
well be actually life-preserving,  essential to human survival
 
for there are simply no known peoples who do not make art.  In
 
the most unforgiving of environments  from the frozen arctic
 
to the waterless desert,  peoples whose every waking moment  is
 
concerned with the basic necessities of life still go on
 
using up their precious calories carving little statues out
 
of rocks or composing songs or reciting poetry.  How can
 
anyone assume that  such activities are  inconsequential or
 
trivial?
 
We do know that a people's overall artistic style at
 
least  in part  is a form of self-identification,  an
 
annoucement to the world and to themselves of their
 
existence,  and their particularity.  That's why people usually
 
like to show you their art -
-
 it's almost always designed for
 
public consumption -
-
 unlike perhaps other more private parts
 
of their lives.  They like showing who and what they are;  it
 
builds morale and morale is key to human movement of any
 
kind.
 
You have to have your nerve up to make anything happen,
 
to face any problem.  Even  just to get through the day in one
 
piece,  you have to have somewhere to start  from,  some central
 
calm conviction that this  is what you do first and then that,
 
and you do it this way because it  is the proper way or the
 
best way or  just  simply the way.  That's what morale is about:
 
I looked the word up in Websters once and he  says  it  is the
 
mental or emotional condition of confidence,  enthusiasm or
 
loyalty with regard to the  function or tasks at hand.  Think
 
about that the next time you start a fund-raising drive.
 
And think back to my little  story about the  crowning of the
 
Swazi king -
-
 how elegantly that enormous people-made
 
cushion,  that assembled mass of individual trivia must work
 
for the king,  to smother his  fears,  to embody comfort and

cowboy poetry,  the  independence of voicing and contrary
 
movement  in a Bach motet.
 
There is no single language of beauty.  I
' ll bet you have
 
heard that a million times.  I know I have,  and I know I' ve
 
probably said it a million times -
-
 thinking how profound I
 
was being,  But no matter how often we repeat  it  somehow we
 
hardly ever really believe  it,  do we?
 We think we do,  and we
 
try hard to,  because we think it's right,  but  somehow or
 
other,  day after day,  some aesthetic systems  just do turn out
 
to be more equal than others.  Those of us who run the local
 
concert  series  just do put on more string quartets than
 
mariachis or gamelan orchestras.  The art museum just does
 
show more  19th century American landscapes than Navajo sand
 
paintings.  It's the same right across the country --  not  just
 
here in Colorado.  You can tell it by looking at the overall
 
budgets all the way from the federal to the state to the
 
local agencies--the proportions betwee n the
 elite
 (classical
 
Euro
pean -
-
 whatever you want to call  it)
 and other
 
traditional
 art forms remain roughly -
-
 about  8 or maybe 10
 
to  1.  It's pretty heavy.
 
And we simply have to do better.  We have to be fairer.  We are
 
often spending public moneys,  and we must continually remind
 
ourselves of what that public consists.  Having a strong
 
multi-cultural policy means a lot more than busing Hispanic
 
children to the opera or putting an American Indian on the
 
art museum board.  That may sound ridiculous to you,  but  I
 
have visited arts groups for whom such actions were
 
considered both exceptional and sufficient.
 
Think back about what  I have been saying about morale and the
 
importance of having the very niftiest parts of your own
 
particular aesthetic system present,  part of the action,
 
recognized,  there.  Now,  I put this to you in terms of such
 
exotic folks as  Swazis  so to make it a bit  easier to swallow
 
but  it applies to everyone.  I realize that as your guest  I am
 
being perhaps a bit offensive here but what's the point of
 
being retired if you can't occasionally call things the way
 
you see them?
 Let me quote from an essay that recently
 
appeared in -
-
 of all improbable publications,  TIME magazine,
 
by Robert Hughes.
 He  said
 
"America is a place  filled with diversity,  unsettled
 
histories,  images  impinging on one another and spawning
 
unexpected shapes
 Its polyphony of voices,  its constant
 
eddying of claims to identity is one of the things that make
 
America America.  This gigantic,  riven,  hybridized,
 
multiracial republic each year receives a major share of the
 
world's emigration,  legal or illegal.
 
"To put the argument  for multiculturalism in merely practical
 
terms of self-interest:  though elites are never going to go
 
away,  the composition of those elites  is not necessarily
 
static.  The future of American ones,  in a globalized economy
 
without a cold war,  will rest with people who can think and
 
act with informed grace across ethnic,  cultural,  linguistic
 
lines.  And the  first  step in becoming such a person lies in
 
acknowledging that we are not one big world family,  or ever
 
likely to be;  that the differences among races,  nations,
 
cultures and their various histories are at  least as profound
 
and as durable as the similarities;  that these differences
 
are not divagations from a European norm but  structures
 
eminently worth knowing about  for their own sake.  In the
 
world that  is  coming,  if you can't navigate differences,
 
you' ve had it."
 
Let me try to give you some practical  steps that might help
 
in Mr. Hughes'  "navigation of differences"
 
a.  Everyone of us needs to do more homework.  We need to
 
be better  informed,  we need to learn more about the

I occasionally suggest that people imagine they
 
themselves were political refugees in Ethiopia perhaps, -- to
 
spend the rest of their lives there -- or Ecuador maybe, and
 
that a loca
l mu lti-cultural festival director asked them to
 
identify "real American music" and explain why some folks do
 
the Texas two-step and what relation that form of dance has
 
to the square dance that other pe��ple say is especially
 
American,  and why does the banjo sometimes have 4 strings and
 
sometimes  5.  It doesn't help here  just to be an "American".
 
This  is when you need expertise and we must all face the fact
 
that  it  is totally possible that an Ethiopian or an
 
Ecuadorian scholar under these circumstances might know more
 
about these points than most of the people in this room do.
 
c.  We all have to be more particular;  we have to try
 
harder to keep standards  impeccable.  Every culture has  its
 
standards and they differ,  one to another;  and every culture
 
has  its relative everyday-nesses and its real elegancies  for
 
which different  standards of excellence pertain.  It is not
 
only fair but essential to demand the very highest standards
 
of every level of art you deal with,  bearing in mind always
 
that  some  is the whoopsy-over-the-moon,  carnival,  circus kind
 
of art and some of it  is the stable,  demanding,  subtle,
 
reverential kind of art.  It is fair to demand the very
 
highest  standards appropriate to every art form you deal
 
with,  and it  is good for the artists as well.  One of the
 
worst things you can do,  I believe,  is to settle for low-
level art of any type -
-
 there can be worthy and unworthy
 
childrens art;  there can be worthy and unworthy popular art.
 
Everybody knows  it  in every culture when low level art
 
happens;  everybody finds it uncomfortable and everybody
 
hates the circumstances  in which it became prominent.
 
There  is much more  I could say,  but  I have talked long
 
enough.  I would like to close by congratulating the many
 
people who organized this meeting and the instructive and
 
fascinating events we have  shared together;  thank you for
 
inviting me.  I thank and congratulate also the many attendees
 
of this conference who have spoken up and shared your wisdom
 
and experience with the rest of us.  I congratulate and thank
 
also the artists whose work we have seen and heard;  it  is you
 
who we celebrate.  You must  let your many friends know what
 
you need in order to be able to continue your work.  It  is the
 
work of the  spirit.  It raises the morale of our people and
 
our nation.  It must not only continue but thrive.
 
If there  is time,  I would be happy to answer any questions
 
you might have.
 
Remembe
 that moat cultures produce several kinds of art.

But get well-informed culturally sophisticated help.  As my
 
Filip /ino-American colleague Yr.  Ricardo Trimillos pi1t  it,  it
 
is a'fallacy to1
'think that  simple bloodlines assume cultural
 
knowing,  cultural propensity,  or cultural entitlement.  Inside
 
and outside the cultural group one must continually search
 
fo r
 
advisors among those individuals who care enough to have
