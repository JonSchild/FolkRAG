Enclosed you will find your own personal copy of Folk Arts' new 1984 guidelines,
 
hot off the press.  Your office should be receiving a bulk mailing in the
 
reasonably near future, but I wanted to send you an advance copy so that you
 
would have extra time to consider the pilot category announced at the top of
 
page 9.
 
If you recall, I first wrote you about the general idea almost two years ago.
 
Since then I
've had the opportunity to discuss this plan with a number of you,
 
and we indeed have three experimental pre-pilot apprenticeship projects underway
 
in Mississippi, New York and Florida.
 However, we're about to start the actual
 
program for which there will be only one deadline during this fiscal y ear:
 
October 1
, 1983. 
Be sure to note that you can apply for sums up to $30,000.  We
 
hope some will apply for less than that amount, as we would like to see this
 
action spread around as far as possible within our allocated budget of $300,000.
 
Some directors have enquired whether  having a folk arts coordinator on the staff
 
is an essential step in order to set up a successful pilot apprenticeship program.
 
The answer is no.
 The panel will, however, be looking for the kind of profession-
alism that a qualified on-board folk arts coordinator and associated advisory
 
committee can provide.
 I shall enclose a copy of my letter of September 10,  1982
 
in which I discussed these and similar issues in case you need to refresh your
 
memories.
 
I hope that a number of you will want to apply and be able to meet the 10/1/83
 
deadline, and that you will be coming up with some really experimental and
 
imatinative ideas.
 Please call (202-682-5449)  if I or any of the Folk Arts
 
staff can be helpful.  We are looking forward to this new program.
 
Cordially,

At a recent NCA-NASAA Joint Policy Committee meeting in Washington D.C.,  the
 
Folk Arts Program presented,  to a generally favorable reaction,  the possibility
 
of a change in its fiscal 84 guidelines.
 Folk Arts has for some years maintained
 
an Apprenticeship Category; small, non-matching grants to individuals who wished
 
to commit for a substantial period of study with a master traditional musician
 
or artisan.
 A flyer describing the category in both Spanish and English is
 
enclosed.
 
The Apprenticeship category has always seemed a good idea,  appealing from many
 
points of view, but it has never flourished in the way we had hoped.
 Applications
 
are discouragingly infrequent and too often inappropriate.
 Monitoring of projects
 
has been excessively difficult.
 Finally,  it has begun to be clear that many of
 
the most successful projects were those that had been arranged on the site by
 
state folk arts coordinators, panelists, or other professionals who knew of-the
 
apprenticeship program and could bring together interested masters and students._
 
This suggested the possibility that we were supporting the category at the wrong
 
l
evel, t
hat perhaps it could be more effective if supported by state rather than
 
federal monies and personnel.  We therefore suggested t
o Chairman Hodsoll and
 
the NCA-NASAA Committee the possibility of a pilot program designed to develop
 
state-based and state-administered apprenticeship programs through special federal
 
grants for which only state arts agencies could apply on a competitive basis.  We
 
are currently t
hinking of reserving $300,000 of 1
984 program funds for the purpose
 
and soliciting grant requests up to $30,000 each, thus enabling us to fund perhaps
 
ten state-based and supervised programs during that trial year.
 
A number of issues arise:
 
a
.  Match. Our current thinking is that 50-50 match would not be required
 
but encouraged and partial match would be strongly encouraged.  Soft match such
 
as administrative expenses would of course be allowable.  We would hope, if the
 
program i
s successful, that cash match could eventually become the order of the
 
day, as t
his i
s not really an expensive program in dollar terms.
 
- 2 -
 
b
.  Quality control. State proposals must observe t
he basic definitions
 
established in t
he Folk Arts guidelines; though variation might become possible
 
in time, t
his program should not be planned t
o include, for example, studio
 
crafts artisans and the like.  State proposals should also take into account
 
the need for expert selection and evaluation of both masters and apprentices;
 
the need for training to be on a reasonably advanced level (
ruling out beginners);
 
a time frame t
hat will allow for flexible learning -- long enough to be productive
 
but varying according to the different requirements for mastering a musical
 
instrument, or a repertoire, or a craft.  In order to prevent confusion of this
 
category with community arts projects, it might be helpful to think of the
 
category as more of a scholarship than an apprenticeship -- a special period for
 
advanced mastery and refinement of skills, set up so as to maximize in each case
 
the best use of time of both master and student.
 
c
.  Administrative costs. Like many folk arts activities, the category will
 
probably be staff-intensive.  Arts agencies with full-time professionally trained
 
folk arts coordinators will still need to include additional travel within their
 
budgets, for example.  All agencies will want to establish some reviewing
 
mechanism both for selection and evaluation; this may require the establishment
 
of a new panel.  Your plan should fit your needs.
 
Although the Program has found satisfactory the funding of apprentices after
 
approval of their agreement to pay the master artisan  rather than simply
 
channeling the grant to the master in the first place; other arrangements
 
might well be proposed.  The question of a stipend for the apprentice is a
 
moot question also.  Some agencies might be interested in inquiring of Suzi Jones,
 
the Native Arts Coordinator at the Alaska S
tate Arts Agency; the ASAA has run
 
their own apprenticeship program for some time now and reports t
hat they have
 
found no special need t
o give apprentices a stipend over and above material
 
and travel costs.  Other areas can, of course, be different.
 
A master teacher, we have found, often knows just exactly who he would prefer
 
to pass his skill on to; if this can be ascertained in advance, an apprenticeship
 
often works much more smoothly.  Another idea that has worked well on the federal
 
level i
s to inquire whether or not a master can handle several students at the
 
same time.  On one occasion we funded up to five apprentices to work with a
 
single master artisan; t
his gave the master a period of considerable economic
 
freedom t
o pursue his own craft and worked out very well.
 
I am going into t
his much detail in order t
o suggest t
o you that this is an
 
opportunity for a SAA, if you are interested, to develop your own program which
 
can be tailored to fit local conditions.  I could see, for example, a proposal
 
to fund apprenticeships in just one major craft -- instrument making, pottery --
for one year, to be followed by a different craft in another year.
 
But even if you as a SAA director do not feel this is an appropriate time for
 
your agency to develop a folk arts apprenticeship program, perhaps you'd still
 
give us the benefit of your reactions to the ideas contained in this mercilessly
 
long letter.  We hope to hear from you before we put this in print.  Here is
 
our schedule.  We would like (
assuming enough states are interested) to include
 
this as a pilot in our 1984 guidelines.  The overall plan must be approved by
 
a December panel in order t
o go to February Council f
or final debate and June
 
publication.  Therefore, if at all possible, I
'd l
ike to get your reactions to
 
t
he overall idea and to any of its features you'd care to comment on within the
 
3
 
next two months, by November 1 at the very latest.  Letters or phone calls
 
would be welcome; if Z am not in the office, Dan Sheehy or Bob Teske would be
 
happy to discuss your ideas or answer any questions.  And finally, if you'd
 
like to work up a pre-pilot application for 1983, we'd be happy to entertain
 
that as well!
 
Thank you in advance for your serious consideration of this idea.

FELLOWSHIP GRANT # 2

 FINAL REPORT
 
One hour after I arrived at their homestead in Kingston, Ontario,
 
Mrs.  Tamos
"
'aitis had me sitting at a loom beginning to weave.  I learned
 
on the loom . I would be given pieces of a sleeve , for example , or pictures
 
of patterns from a particular region and would have to look and look
 
and then create my own . Similar but different .   
1
>   What exactly does
 
that mean? Understanding the spirit,  then creating within that spirit,  a
 
unique design . Which are the elements that must remain , and which can be
 
altered ? An exercize in seeing and seeing more and more and looking again
 
for what you have not seen . What in these twelve aprons from Dzukija makes
 
them clearly identifiable as aprons from Dzukija and how do I translate
 
this information into an original yet authentic apron from Dzukija of my
 
own? Copying is out of the question.  So I look...  What do I see? Narrow bands
 
of color with thinner bands of color separating them, with some little
 
patterns interspersed with a larger pattern.  I begin to weave and I have done
 
it all wrong. My color sense is off.  I must leave my current western sense
 
of color out of this and look again. What Mrs.  Tamolgaitis tells me about
 
using colors that contrast reminds me of Pointilism.  Blue then red then green_
 
But how much? Sometimes a band , sometimes merely one thread . And all of
 
a sudden,  the weaving is vibrating.
 
Such was my process every day for 3 months,  8-10 hours a day , 5-6 days
 
a week . Mrs.  Tamo�;aitis would leave me with problems to solve,  projects to
 
work on,  and go to her own looms.  I,
 would constantly be running to her
 
with questions.  For an hour or two "Mr.  Tamo'gaitis,  an accomplished weaver
 
himself, would teach me theory,  bu  most of the time I spent at the loom.
 
Among the things I learned were the traditional methods of throwing
 
a very fine and long warp(72 yards long and 1360 threads wide), winding this
 
very long warp into the loom,  making string heddles,  one for each of the 1360
 
threads(a task that took much longer than the grant time),  beginning to
 
look at the regional differences in garment design and construction,  and then
 
the regional differences of pattern and color use in the cloth used for
 
each different costume piece,  and finally,  a task of finally constructing
 
a garment : choosing the elements of the pattern,  finishing the hand woven
 
cloth to keep it from falling apart in the process of making the garment or
 
later,  learning regional stitch variations to sew the pieces together,  and
 
learning the various crocheted edgings,  buttons,  and various other finishing
 
touches that reveal a garment to be truly hand made.
 
Although I grew up with these costumes around me,  I really grew to see
 
and understand their complexity only through learning to make them.  More
 
than anything else,  the summer's work with Mrs.  Tamo6aitis taught me to
 
not only make,  but to see what I look at with an expanded vision.  Before,
 
I would look at a Lithuanian apron and I would be awed at its beauty,  but not
 
be able to see much more than that.  Now I can look at the elements from 10
 
feet away and see,  for example,  bands of ever narrowing horizontal stripes
 
at such and such a distance from each other . From four feet , I begin to
 
see the particular types of weave and color used in each of the bands.  From
 
two feet,  I study the colors in the patterns in relation to each other,  and
 
finally, with a magnifying glass,  study the thread by thread variation
 
of color and the actual geometrical pattern weave design.
 
My studies also revolutionized my sense of color and pattern combining
 
I had never understood why my parents' and grandparents' generations /
-)
 
wore those embarrassing combinations of Dlaids and plaids,  stripes apd plaids
 
r
 
and stripes and stripes of seemingly unrelated colors . After my studies
 
however,  I realized that in Lithuanian folk culture as in many traditional
 
cultures , color and pattern combining os much more complex and sophisti-
cated than our wearing of a beige shirt with a brown skirt. e)
 
The work I did with Mrs.  Tamosaitis and her husband, excited me and
 
left me with tremendous enthusiasm . The Lithuanian community was also very
 
excited . I have been invited to speak several times and to write articles.
 
There is a definate need in the community not only for the younger
 
generations to take on and carry on the traditions, but also to gather and
 
collect and protect the remaining artifacts and document the information and
 
the processes of making them . My grant was invaluable for this.  It would be
 
even better if there were possibilities - financially and socially, to
 
assist people doing and interested in this work with some more regularity
 
so that it could continue and prosper.

This past Tuesday I had lunch here with Michael Clark,
 
President of the Anthracite Industry Association.  Clark has
 
solicited his membership for a contribution of a ton of an-
thracite coal.  He said he expects several companies to offer
 
the coal; when responses are in he will select the best and
 
let us know who the contributor is. At that point we can ar-
range package and transportation to Joaquin Lujan,  P.O.  Box
 
22894,  G.M.F.,  Guam 96921  (
671-734-3032).  I told Clark that
 
Murray We1Bh will negotiate the logistics for us, with Clark's
 
help.
 
When the transfer is ready,  Clark would like to have you
 
go with him to the contributing company's site in northeast-
ern Pennsylvania for a press event.  Besides yourselves and a
 
company representative,  Clark would like to involve Sondra
 
Myers, who has been such a leader of both arts and humanities -
advocacy groups,  and possibly Congressman Joe McDade  (although
 
the Congressional District might not be McDade's).  Both Myers
 
and McDade are friends of Clark.  Ideally,  this might occur ei-
ther Friday, May 29th, or Friday,  June 5th  (
both days are clea r
 
at this point).  Bernie Lopez is sending press material on Lujan
 
for use in this connection.
 
At Bess Hawes'  request,  I gave Clark information on Philip
 
Simmons,  the blacksmith in South Carolina who received a Nation-
al Heritage Award and whose problem concerning coal is similar
 
to that of Lujan.  I think that once the Lujan matter is worked
 
out,  a similar arrangement might be made for Simmons.
 
Clark is very enthusiastic about helping us. Whether we
 
can work the whole thing out- in the next couple of weeks how-
ever,  I' m not sure.

. What impact would t

I
n a couple o
f i

oordinators pointed out t
hat t

lready self-funded, and c

t

The answer t

Exactly half o
