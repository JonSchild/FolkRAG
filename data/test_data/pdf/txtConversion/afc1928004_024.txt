I 
DREAMED MY BOY WAS HOME 
AGAIN. 
[By permission of Messrs. Sawyer & Thompson, Music Publishers.] 
LONELY, weary, broken-hearted, 
As I 
laid me down to sleep, 
Thinking of the day we parted, 
When you told me not to weep, — 
Soon I 
dreamed that peaceful angels 
Hovered o'er the battle- plain, 
Singing songs of joy and sadness, 
And my boy was home again! 
Cflonus. 
How well I 
know such thoughts of joy, 
Such dreams of bliss, are vain; 
My heart is sad, my tears will flow, 
Until my boy is home again. 
Tears were changed to loud rejoicings, 
Night was turned to endless day, 
Lovely birds were sweetly singing, 
Flowers bloomed in light array; 
Old and young seemed light and cheerful, 
Peace seemed every where to reign, 
My poor heart forgot its sorrow, 
For my boy was home again! 
CHORUS. 
How well I 
know, ezc. 
But the dream is past, and with it 
All my happiness is gone; 
Cheerful thoughts of joy have vanished, 
I 
must still in sorrow mourn. 
Soon may peace with all its blessings 
Our unhappy land reclaim; 
Then my tears will cease their flowing, 
And my boy be home again! 
CHORUS.; — How well I 
know, &e.

HOPPITY, ICICICITY, HIGH 
AND LOW. 
0 DEAR! 0 my! how queer I 
feel, 
I 
don't know what to do, 
For I'm in love with Polly Peel, 
Wot lives at Number Two. 
My heart goes bump, my legs go jump, 
I'm lost, I 
know, for sure; 
I 
shall dance ' till worn down to a 
stump, 
0, won't that be a 
cure ? 
A cure, a 
cure; 0, yes, a 
cure, 
'Twill be indeed a 
cure; 
With my hoppity, kickity, high and low, 
I 
am a 
reg'lar cure. 
I 
dance around her day and night, 
And find I 
cannot cease; 
But she's got another chap all right, 
And he's in the police. 
His dress is blue, his letter, Q, 
He treats me like a 
boor; 
His number it is Onety-One, 
And he says that I'm a 
cure. 
A cure, a 
cure; 0, yes, a 
cure, 
He says that I'm a 
cure; 
With my hoppity, kickity, high and low, 
I 
am a 
reg'lar cure. 
I 
went Miss Polly Peel to meet, 
But the man who brought the coal 
Left wide the opening in the street, 
So I 
tumbled down the hole; 
As black as soot, poor me they put 
In water most impure, 
By way of giving me a 
wash,— 
Now wasn't that a 
cure ? 
A cure, a 
cure; 0, yes, a 
cure, 
0, wasn't that a 
cure ? 
With my hoppity, kickity, high and low, 
I 
am a 
reg'lar cure, 
One day she gave me sich a 
smile, 
0, how my heart did beat! 
When, after walking near a 
mile, 
She asked me to stand treat. 
Kickity — Concluded, 
She broke a 
glass, and then did say, 
" 
This young mun, so demure, 
The damage I 
have done will pay! "-
0, wasn't that a 
cure ? 
A cure, a 
cure; 0, yes, a 
cure; 
0, wasn't that a 
cure ? 
With my hoppity, kickity, high and low, 
I 
am a 
reg'lar cure. 
I 
told them I 
had got no cash: 
, 
Said they, " That's rather odd; 
But as the glass has gone to smash, 
Why you must go to 
uod." 
In vain I 
said to Onety- ne 
That I 
was awful poor; 
So I 
tipped for what I 
hadn't done,— 
My eyes! that was a 
cure; 
A cure, a 
cure; 0, yes, a 
cure, 
0, yes, it was a 
cure. 
With my hoppity, kickity, high and low, 
I 
am a 
reg'lar cure. 
You'll ask me why it is my plan 
To dance, and not be stopping; 
I 
was bit by a 
mad Fiddler Man, 
That's why I 
keep on hopping. 
But I 
have got no more to say 
That you could now endure, 
Except, before I 
dance away, 
That I'm a 
grateful cure. 
A cure, a 
cure; 0, yes, a 
cure; 
I 
am a 
grateful cure. 
With my hoppity, kickity, high and low, 
I 
am a 
reg'lar cure. 
6 WE'LL FIGHT FOR UNCLE ,
ABE. 
W AY down in Old Varginny, 
I 
suppose you all do know, 
They have tried to bust the Union, 
But they find it is no go; 
The Yankee boys are starting out 
De Union for to sabe, 
And we're gwine down to Washington 
To fight for Uncle Abe. 
Cnonus. 
Rip, rap; flip, flap; 
Strap your knapsacks on your back, 
For we're gwine down to Washington 
To fight for Uncle Abe. 
There is Gen'ral Grant at Vicksburg, 
Just see what he has done, — 
He has taken sixty cannon, 
And made the rebels run 
And next he will take R. 
I'll bet you half 
And if he catch 
0, won't h 
chmand, 
dollar; 
es Gen'ral Johnson — 
e 
make him holler ? 
ORLI& — Rip, rap, &c. 
The season now is coming 
When the roads begin to dry, 
Soon the Army of the Potomac 
Will make the rebels fly; 
For General McClellan he's the man 
The Union for to sabe; 
0, hail Columbia's right side up, 
And so's your Uncle Abe. 
CHORUS. — Rip, rap, & c. 
You may talk of Southern chivalry, 
And cotton being king, 
But I 
guess before the war is done 
You'll think another thing; 
They say that recognition 
Will the rebel country sabe, 
But Johnny Bull and Mister France 
Are afraid of Uncle Abe. 
Clionts. — Rip, rap, & c.

SPRINGTIME'S SIM was softl 
O'er hill, and plain, 
Verdure fringed th 
Gentle br 
Birds 
shining 
nd brake; 
e 
streamlet's lining, 
eezes fanned the lake; 
sang gayly ' neath their bowers, 
Softly flowed the rippling rill, 
Brightly bloomed the early flowers, 
When I 
met svveet Minnie Dill. 
CHORUS. 
Eyes will moisten, lips will quiver, 
And for her the tears will flow; 
Minnie Dill of Maumee River, 
Far away in Ohio. 
When the tassell'd corn was waving 
'Neath the passing summer's breath; 
When the lake its shores was laving, 
And the bloom was on the heath; 
When the ivy vines were creeping 
O'er the sloping sombre hill, 
And the swain the sheafs was reaping, 
Then I 
wooed fair Minnie Dill. 
Cnouus.—Eyes will moisten, &c. 
Autumn came; the wind was wailing 
Mournful accents as it passed; 
Frostwork glistened o'er the paling, — 
Minnie did not heed the blast: 
Near the hill's broad base she's sleeping, 
O'er her spreads the pure, white snow, 
Where the Maumee River's creeping, 
Far away in Ohio. 
CHORUS. — Eyes will moisten, &c. 
8 THY MOTHER WILL ROCS Trrg  
TO SLEEP . 
[Answer to "Rocx ME TO SLEEP, MOTHER."] 
HAS the cold, cold world, my darling, 
Left its imprint on thy heart ? 
Has the memory of thy mother 
E'er been suffered to depart ? 
Though thy heart is warm and loving, 
Let the future its wealth keep, 
Till, when life's sad dream is over, 
I 
shall rock my child to sleep. 
Do the sweet thoughts of thy childhood 
Tempt thy lone heart to rebel, 
And with memories of life's freshness, 
Ask thy tears of grief to swell ? 
Think of scenes where joy eternal 
Gleams with beauty undefiled; 
Where sweet happiness dwells ever, — 
I 
shall rock to sleep my child. 
Wreathe thy face in smiles so rosy 
That the noonday sun shall pale, 
And let tears of woe and sorrow 
On thy bright face tell no tale. 
Though thy path be hard and thorny, 
Do not stay to fear or weep, 
For, when thou shalt cross death's river, 
I 
will rock my child to sleep. 
Let no shadows e'er dismay thee, 
Let no grief thy heart annoy; 
Think of realms where I 
am waiting 
For thee with a 
smile of joy. 
Angels' arms shall bear thee upward, 
Angels shall their vigils keep, 
When, in lands of bliss unfading, 
I 
shall rock my child to sleep.

DEAR MOTHER; 
I'VE COME HOME 
TO DIE. 
[By permission of the Publishers, Messrs. Firth, Son, & Co.] 
DEAR mother, I 
remember well 
The parting kiss you gave to me, 
When merry rang the village bell ;— 
My heart was full of joy and glee. 
I 
did not dream that one short year 
Would crush the hopes that soared so high! 
0, Mother, dear, draw near to me; 
Dear mother, I've come home to die. 
Cnottcrs. 
Call sister — brother-- to my side, 
And take your soldier's last good-by; 
0, mother, dear, draw near to me; 
Dear mother, I've come home to die. 
Hark! mother, ' tis the village hell; 
I 
can no longer with thee stay: 
My country calls: To arms! to arms! 
The foe advance in fierce array! 
The vision's past — I 
feel that now 
For country I 
can only sigh; 
0, mother, dear, draw near to me, 
Dear mother, I've come home to die. 
CHORUS. — Call sister, & c. 
Dear mother, sister, brother, all 
One parting kiss, — to all good-by; 
Weep not, but clasp your hand in mine, 
And let me like a 
soldier die! 
I've met the foe upon the field 
Where kindred fiercely did defy; 
I 
fought for right— God bless the flag! 
Dear mother, I've come home to die. 
CHORUS. — Call sister, & c.

LITTLE MAUD.

0, WHERE is our dainty, our darling, 
The daintiest darling of all ? 
0, where is the voice on the stairway, 
0, where is the voice in the hall ? 
The little, short steps on the entry, 
The silvery laugh in the hall ? 
0, where is our dainty, our darling, 
The daintiest darling of all ? 
CHORUS. 
Little Maud, little Maud, 
0, the daintiest darling of all. 
Little Maud, little Maud, 
0, the daintiest darling of all. 
The peaches are ripe in the garden, 
The apricots ready to fall; 
The blue grapes are dripping their honey 
In sunshine upon the white wall. 
0, where are the lips full and melting, 
That looked up so pouting and red, 
When we dangled the sun-purpled bunches 
Of Isabells over her head ? 
0, Maud! little Maud! say, where are you ? 
(She never replies to our call) 
0, where is our dainty, our darling, 
The daintiest darling of all ? 
CHORUS. — Little Maud, & c. 
LULA'S GONE. 
(By perm-lesion of the Publishers, Messrs. Firth, Son, & Co.) 
THE birds are singing sweet as ever, 
On the banks of Elon's river; 
Bright the sun is shining clear, 
Painting many a 
rainbow there. 
But Lula's gone, far, far away, 
Joining in the angels' lay; 
In the clear, fair, azure sky, 
There she lives, no more to die. 
Lula Lee, 0, Lula Lee, 
Dost thou ever think of me ? 
CHORUS. 
Lula Lee, 0, Lula Lee, 
Dost thou ever think of me ? 
When her cheek grew like the lily, 
White and pure as beings heavenly, 
Dark forebodings rung a 
knell, 
More sorrowful than tongue can tell. 
On our heart-strings, day by day, 
As she faded, slow away, 
0, then bitter tears were shed, 
Wrung from hearts to sorrow wed. 
Lula Lee, 0, Lula Lee, 
Thou wilt ne'er come back to me. 
CHortus. 
Lula Lee, 0, Lula Lee, 
Thou wilt ne'er come back to me. 
Day by day these flowers she tended, 
Day by day these paths she wended, 
Now, alas! her fairy form 
Is seen no more these paths to roam; 
0, how we loved the gentle one, 
0, h.w to hope we fondly clung, 
As day by day our Lula grew 
Paler than the winter's snow. 
Lula Lee, 0, Lula Lee, 
Would that I 
could go to thee. 
Cnoitus. 
Lula Lee, 0, Lula Lee, 
1Vould that I 
could go to thee.

GOOD-BY, good-by to summer, 
For summer's nearly gone, 
The garden smiling faintly 
Cool breezes in the sun;

And scarlet breast-knot gay.

The leathery pears and apples

Hang russet on the bough; 
It's autumn, autumn, autumn, late,

And moan all round the house; 
The frosty ways like iron, 
The branches plumed with snow, 
Alas! in winter dead and dark, 
Where can poor Robin go ?

SINGING THROUGH THE RAIN. 
THEY said the spring was coming, 
The dreary days were past, 
The bee for honey roaming 
Would meet the flowers at last; 
Though still the cloud was flinging. 
Its shadows o'er the plain, 
A 
little bird kept singing, 
Singing through the rain ; 
A 
bird kept singing, singing, 
Singing through the rain. 
The little bird sang gayly, 
While beating showers went by, 
And waited, waited, daily, 
For blue lightin the sky ; 
Till merry May was bringing 
The bright days back again, 
That little bird kept singing, 
Singing through the rain ; 
That bird kept singing, singing, 
Singing through the rain ! 
With voice of hope in sadness, 
That song-bird seemed to say 
how hearts may beat in gladness, 
Though shadows dim the way; 
As if a 
lesson bringing, 
Where drooping hearts complain, 
That little bird kept singing, 
Singing through the rain ; 
That little bird kept singing, 
Singing through the- rain 
14 BROTHER'S FAINTING AT THE 
DOOR. 
[By permission of the Publishers, Messrs. Firth, Son, & Co.] 
YONDER comes a 
weary soldier 
With faltering steps across the moor, 
Memories of the past steal o'er me; 
He totters to the cottage door. 
Look! my heart cannot deceive me; 
'Tis one we deemed on earth no more! 
Call mother, haste, do not tarry, 
For brother's fainting at the door. 
Call mother, haste, do not tarry, 
For brother's fainting at the door. 
CHontis. 
Kindly greet the weary soldier; 
Words of comfort may restore; 
You may have an absent brother 
Fainting at a 
stranger's dpor; 
You may have an absent brother 
Fainting at a 
stranger's door. 
Tell us, brother, of the battle, 
Why you were numbered with the slain; 
We, who thought you lost forever, 
Now clasp you to our arms again! 
0, may others share the blessing

I 
was wounded and a 
prisoner; 
Our ranks were broken, forced to fly, 
Thrown within a 
gloomy dungeon, 
Away from friends, alone to die. 
Still the hope was strong within me, — 
A cherished hope that would restore,— 
I 
have lived, by Heaven's blessing, 
To meet my loved one's at the door; 
I 
have lived, by Heaven's blessing, 
To meet my loy-ed ones at the door.

PEOPLE WILL TALK. 
[By permission of the Publishers, Messrs. Firth, Son, & Co.] 
Wn may get through the world, but 'twill be very slow 
If we listen to all that is said as we go; 
We'll be worried, and fretted, and kept in a 
stew, 
For meddlesome tongues must have something to do. 
CHORUS. 
For people will talk you know, . 
People will talk; 0, yes, they must talk you know. 
If quiet and modest,.you'll have it presumed 
That your humble position is only assumed; 
You're a 
wolf in sheep's clothing, or else you're a 
fool, 
But don't get excited, — keep perfectly cool. 
Citonus. — For people will talk, & c. 
If generous and noble, they'll vent out their spleen; 
You'll hear some loud hints that you're selfish and mean; 
If upright, and honest, and fair as the day, 
They'll call you a 
rogue, in a 
sly, sneaking way. 
CHORUS — For people will talk„ & c. 
And then if you show the least boldness of heart, 
Or a 
slight inclination to take your own part, 
They will call you an upstart, conceited, and vain; 
But keep straight ahead— don't stop to explain. 
CHORUS. — For people will talk, & c. 
If threadbare your coat, or old fashioned your hat, 
Some one, of course, will take notice of that, 
And hint rather strong that you can't pay your way; 
But don't get excited, whatever they say. 
CHORUS. — For people will talk, &c. 
If you dress in the fashion, don't think to escape, 
For they criticise then in a 
different shape; 
You're ahead of your means, or your tailor's unpaid; 
But mind your own business, there's nought to be made.

MonrEn, is the battle over ? 
Thousands have been killed, they say; 
Is my father coming ? Tell me,

Is he well ? or is he wounded ? 
Mother, do you think he's slain ? 
If you know' I pray you, tell me 
Will my father come again? 
Mother, dear, you're always sighing 
Since you last the paper read; 
Tell me why you now are crying ? 
WhY that cap upon your head-? 
Ah! I 
see you cannot tell me: 
Father's one among the slain. 
Although he loved us very dearly, 
He will never come again.

34 I'M HOME, 
AND MY RAMBLINGS 
ARE O'ER. 
FROM my own native village I 
went on my rambles; 
Being weary of travelling, I 
sat down to rest 
Near the foot of a 
mountain, where sprang a 
clear foun-
tain, 
With bread and spring water myself to refresh. 
I 
heard a 
voice crying, lamenting, and sighing, — 
" 
0, come to thy home, and thy ramblings give o'er! 
0, think of the hearts that are breaking for thee! 
So come to thy home, and thy ramblings give o'er." 
• 
CHORUS. — I 
heard a 
voice, &c. 
I 
was not fondly dreaming; I'm sure I 
was sane; 
But still that fond voice it seemed hovering near; 
'Twas,my wife's, 'twas my Emma's; so iweetly it came, 
Saying, " Thy children's fond prattle dost thou not 
hear ?" 
But still she kept crying, lamenting, &C. 
CHORUS. - I 
heard a 
voice, &c. 
lj 
I picked up my knapsack, raised my hand to the skies, 
And vowed in my heart I 
would wander no more; 
I 
reached my lone cabin, wiped tears from my eyes, 
Saw my Emma and children welcome me to the door. 
Now my ramblings are over, I'll be no more a 
rover; 
For Plenty is smiling round my cabin door; 
No more shall their hearts break in sorrow for me; 
I'm home! I'm home! and my ramblings are o'er. 
CHORUS. — Now my ramblings, & c. 
COME, rally, brothers, rally! around the stripes and stars; 
Fighting the odious rebel flag, that flaunts its triple bars; 
A 
banner foul, dishonored, no emblem for the free; 
For this, the bonnie Red, White, and Blue forever more 
must be. 
Cironus. 
Hurrah! hurrah! For a 
nation's rights, hurrah! 
They shall not harm our beautiful flag, nor quench a 
single star. 
We're all a 
band of brothers; we mourn this civil strife; 
Still will we smite the rebel hand that seeks our nation's 
life. 
0, men of sunny Georgia! 
Brave hearts of Tennessee! 
Ye Texas Rovers ! — raise again the banner of the free! 
CEMET'S. — Hurrah, & c. 
Now down with South Carolina! that haughty, treacherous 
State; 
Humble her tyrants in the dust! (forever ignobly great); 
But up with the Southern poor man! strike off the cap-
( 
tive's chain! 
Rally around the starry flag, and sing in loud refrain. 
CHORUS. — 
Hurrah, & c. 
0, no! the " Bonnie Blue Flag," with one white, ghastly 
star, 
Never shall float before our ranks to lead the brave afar; 
But blend the hues of sunset, the bonnie " Red, White, 
and Blue," 
Shall fire our hearts with patriot zeal, with hope and 
courage true. 
CISORES. — Hurrah, & c. 
FLOATING On the wind, 
Songs of other years 
Freshly come to mind, 
Melting me to tears; 
Every breeze that blows 
Seems a 
haunted tone, 
Whispering words like those 
But to spirits known, 
Stealing o'er my mind, 
Melting me to tears, 
Floating on the wind, 
Come songs of other years. 
0, ye mystic songs, 
Blending with the air, 
flow my spirit longs 
In your joy to share; 
Where, from harps unseen, 
Music of the mind, 
Earth and heaven between, 
Floats upon the wind. 
Stealing o'er my mind, 
Melting me to tears, 
Floating on the wind, 
Come songs of other years. 
FROM THE RED BATTLE-FIELD. 
SILENTLY, tenderly, mournfully home, 
From the red battle-field, volunteers come; 
Not with a 
loud hurrah, nor with a 
wild eclat, 
Not with the trump of war, come our brave sons from far 
Gently and noiselessly bear them along; 
flushed be the battle-hymn, music, and song. 
Silently, tenderly, mournfully home, 
Not as they marched away volunteers come; 
Not with the sword and gun, not with the stirring drum, 
Comes our dead hero home now all his work is done: 
Thoughtfully, prayerfully, bear ye the dead, 
Pillow it softly, the volunteer's head. 
Silently, tenderly, mournfully home; 
Where should the fallen brave volunteer come 
But to his native hills, where the bright, gushing rills, 
Freedom's sweet music fills, and her soft dew distils ? 
Peacefully, prayerfully, lay our brave friend 
Close by the home that he fought to defend. 
Silently, tearfully, welcome the brave; 
Glory encircles the patriot's grave: 
Here let affection swell, here let the marble tell 
How the brave hero fell, loving his country well! 
Silently, tenderly, mournfully home, 
Welcome the volunteers, one by one. 
IS THAT MOTHER BENDING O'ER 
ME 
? 
Is 
that mother bending o'er me, 
As she sang my cradle hymn, 
Kneeling there in tears before me? 
Say! my sight is growing dim. 
Comes she from the old home lowly, 
Out among the Northern hills, 
To her pet boy, dying slowly 
Of War's battle-wounds and ills ? 
Mother! 0, we bravely battled 
Battled ' till the day was done; 
While the leaden hail-storm rattled,— 
Man to man, and gun to gun. 
But we failed, and I 
am dying, 
Dying in my boyhood's years. 
There, — no weeping, self-denying, — 
Noble deaths demand no tears. 
Fold your arms again around me; 
Press again my aching head; 
• 
Sing the lullaby you sang me; 
Kiss me, mother, ere I'm dead.

HANNAH'S AT THE , 
W INDOW 
BINDING SHOES. 
POOR, lone Hannah! sitting at the window binding shoes, 
Faded, wrinkled, sitting, stitching, in a 
mournful muse. 
Bright-eyed beauty once was she, 
When the bloom was on the tree. 
Spring and winter 
Hannah's at the window binding shoes. 
Not a 
neighbor passing, nod or answer will refuse 
To her whisper, " Is there from the fishers any news ? " 
0, her heart's adrift with one, 
On an endless voyage gone. 
Night and morning • 
Hannah's at the window binding shoes. 
Fair young Hannah, Ben, the sunburnt fisher, gayly wooes, 
Tall and clever, for a 
willing heart and hand he sues. 
May-day skies are all aglow, 
And the waves are laughing se ! 
For her wedding, 
Hannah leaves her window and her shoes. 
May is passing. 'Along the apple boughs a 
pigeon cooes 
Hannah shudders; for the wild sou'wester mischief brews 
Round the rocks of Marblehead, 
Outward bound, a 
schooner sped. 
Silent, lonesome, 
Hannah's at the window binding shoes. 
'Tis November; now no tear her cheek bedews; 
From Newfoundland, not a 
sail returning will she lose: 
Whispering hoarsely, " 0 fishermen, have ye 
heard of Ben ? 
0 
fishermen, have ye heard of Ben?" 
Old with watching, 
Hannah's at the window binding shoes. 
Twenty winters wear and tear the jugged shore she views 
Twenty summers — never one has brought her any news. 
Still her dim eyes silently 
Chase the white sails o'er the sea. 
Hapless, faithful, 
Hannah's at the window binding shoes, 
I'M LONELY SINCE MY 31101..u.hlt 39 
DIED. 
I'm lonely since my mother died, 
Though friends and kindred gather near; 
I 
cannot check the rising sigh, 
Or stay the silent, heartfelt tear. 
Of earthly friends she was the best, 
My erring youthful steps to guide; 
0, do not smile because I 
weep; 
I'm lonely since my mother died. 
CHOI:ars. 
I'm lonely since my mother died, 
Though friends and kindred gather near; 
I 
cannot check the rising sigh, 
Or stay the silent, heartfelt tear. 
You may not deem it brave or strong 
To let these tears so often flow, 
But those who've lost a 
mother's love 
Can tell the pain of thy sad woe. 
Could I 
but call her back again, 
And kneel once more down by her side, 
I'd love her better than before; 
I'm lonely since my mother died. 
CHORUS. —  
lonely, &c. 
0, you who have a 
mother dear, 
Let not a 
word or act give pain, 
But cherish, love her as your life, 
You ne'er can have her like again. 
Then, when she's called from you away, 
Across Death's dark and troubled tide, 
In vain, with me, you need not say, 
I'm lonely since my mother died. 
CHORUS. — I'm lonely, &e. 
4CE SPEED AWAY! SPEED' AWAY! - 
SPEED away! Speed away! on thine errand of light, 
There's a 
young heart gwaiting thy coming to-night; 
She will fondle thee close, she will ask for the loved, 
Who pine upon earth since the " Day-star " has roved; 
She will ask if we miss her, so long is her stay, 
Speed away! Speed away! Speed away! 
Wilt thou tell her, bright songster, the old chief i lone, 
That he sits all the day by his cheerless hearthstone; 
That his tomahawk lies all unnoted the while, 
And his thin lips wreathe ever in one sunless smile; 
That the old chieftain mourns her, and why will she stay ? 
Speed away! Speed away! Speed away! 
And 0, wilt thou tell her, blest bird on the Wing, 
That her mother hath ever a 
sad song to sing; 
That she standeth alone, in the still, quiet night, 
And her fond heart goes forth for the being of light, 
Who had slept in her bosom, but who would not stay. 
Speed away! Speed away! Speed away! 
Go, bird of the silver wing! fetterless now; 
Stoop not thy bright pinions on you mountain's brow; 
But hie thee away, o'er rock, river and glen 
And find our young " Day- star" ere night dose again; 
Up! onward! let nothing thy mission delay, 
Speed away r 
Speed away! Speed away! 
MARION LEE. 
COME to me love, for here I 
am waiting, 
Sadly and lone, by the dark swelling sea; 
Cold winds are blowing, and strange voices moaning, 
And fast flow the tears of thy Marion Lee. 
0, why dost thou tarry so long on the ocean ? 
My poor heart is breaking in sorrow for thee; 
Come to me, love, for here I

Peaceful he sleeps where the sea-flowers are blooming, 
And mermaids are watching his bright coral pillow. 
Long have I 
watched through the night's gloomy shadows, 
Gazing far out o'er the dark troubled sea; 
Striving in vain, through the mists that are hovering, 
To catch but one glance of thy proud bark and thee. 
0, why dost thou tarry, & e. 
COME WITH THY SW EET VOICE 
AGAIN. 
iBy permlision of the Publishers, Messrs. Firth, Son, & Coa 
COME with thy sweet voice again, 
To my heart still dear, 
Laden with soft, soothing pain, 
Like a 
tear, like a 
tear. 
Bright visions, long vanished, 
Round thy melodies beam; — 
Dined in the lap Of thy Sighs, 
Let me dream, let me dream. 
Come again! 
Come with thy sweet voice again! 
Come, 0, come again! 
Come with thy sweet voice again! 
Bring not a 
language that tells 
How the light hours roll; 
Come with the music that wells 
From thy soul, from thy soul. 
Come not with bright offerings, 
Cold, unhallowed, and new. 
Bring but thine own gentle heart, 
Ever true, ever true. 
Come aghin! 
Come with thy sweet voice again! 
Come, 0, come again! 
Come with thy sweet voice again! 
42 BELLA'S GOOD NIGHT TO THE 
FLOWERS. 
Ix a 
lovely garden darling Bella stood, 
Gazing at the pretty flowers in childish, happy mood; 
Sweet the roses blossomed with the sun's bright ray, 
And the velvet dahlias with the dew-drops play. 
Skipping round from flower to flower my 
little one did go, 
Clasping with her tiny hands those pure and white as snow. 
CHORUS. 
Nestled in her little bed, I 
watched her dimpled light, 
As in her seeming dreams she said, 
" 
Good night, pretty flowers, good night." 
Now the morning sunbeams of my life have passed, 
Lessons from those pretty flowers I'll cherish to the last; 
Though they bloom to die, they blossom yet again, 
Emblems of bright heaven, free from care and pain. 
In the troubles of my life my darling child I 
see, [glee. 
Watching o'er those beauteous flowers in youthful, happy 
"Pretty flowers," still hear her say, " the sun has gone 
away; [day." 
Good night, dear ones, I'll think of you, and come another 
CHoftus. — Nestled, & c. 
ANGELS LISTEN WHILE SHE 
SPEAKS. 
Low her voice is, soft and kind; 
Sorrow ne'er appeals in vain; 
,She can soothe the troubled mind, 
Bid despair to hope again. 
She is good, and kind, and true; 
Her the weeping mourner seeks; 
Holy words her lips bedew, 
Angels listen when she speaks. 
From her lips but words of truth 
Fall like manna from above, 
All the innocence of youth, 
All the strength of perfect love; 
Ne'er a 
thought, unkind, unjust, 
Brings the rose-tint to her cheeks, 
Still she bids us hope and trust; 
Angels listen when she speaks. 
LULEANNA.* 
43 
I 
KNOW a 
little cot, that is humble as can be, •" 
It stands on the bank of Susquehanna, [play, 
When the wild-flowers blow, and the humming-birds 
And there lives my sweet Luleanna. 
She's mild as the eve, she's fair as the dawn, 
She's graceful as the flow of Susquehanna, 
She's my idea of angel on earth, 
The idol of my heart, Luleanna. 
CHORUS.— She's mild as the eve, & c. 
If I 
were a 
fish, I 
would swim by her side, 
When she sails on the bold Susquehanna; 
If I 
were the wind, I 
would whistle through the sails, 
And play with the curls of Luleanna. 
If I 
were any thing else than myself, 
I 
would live nowhere but beside her, 
I 
would dream of her by night, and sing to her by day, 
Till I 
won the heart of sweet Luleanna. 
CHORUS. 
She's mild as the eve, & c. 
She bathes her cheeks in the morning dew, 
The placid stream is her mirror, 
The pebbles are the jewels she wears in her hair, 
And her carriage is her boat on the river. 
CHORUS. — She's mild as the eve, & c. 
KATE O'SHANE. 
THm cold winds of autumn wave mournfully here, 
The leaves round me falling are faded and sere, 
But chill though the breeze be, and threatening the storm 
My heart, full of fondness, beats kindly and warm. 
0 Dennis, dear, come back to me! 
I 
count the hours away from thee. 
Return, 0

From thy own darling, Kate O'Shane! 
'Twas here we last parted, 'twas here we first met, 
And ne'er has he caused me one tear of regret; 
Though seasons may alter, their change I 
defy; 
My heart's one glad summer when Dennis is by. 
0 Dennis, dear, come back to me!

THE PICKET GUARD. 
"ALL quiet along the Potomac!" they say, 
Except, now and then, a 
stray picket 
Is shot, as he walks on his beat to and fro, 
By a 
rifleman, hid in a 
thicket. 
'Tis nothing,— a 
private or two, now and then, 
Will not count in the news of the battle; 
Not an officer lost, only one of the men, 
Moaning out, all alone, the death rattle. 
CHORUS. — 'Tis nothing, & c. 
" 
All quiet along the Potomac!" to-night, 
Where the soldiers lie, peacefully dreaming; 
Their tents in the rays of the cold autumn moon, 
Or the light of the watchfires are gleaming. 
A tremulous sigh, as the gentle night wind 
Through the forest leaves softly is creeping, 
While the stars up above, with their glittering eyes, 
Keep watch, while the army is sleeping. 
Cnonrs. 
All quiet, all quiet, all silent to-night, 
Where the soldiers are peacefully dreaming, 
And their tents in the ray of the clear autumn moon, 
Or the the light of the watchfires are gleaming. 
There's only the sound of the lone sentry's tread, 
As he tramps from the rock to the fountain, 
And thinks of the two in the low trundle-bed, 
Far away in his cot on the mountain. 
His musket falls slack, and his face dark and grim, 
Grows gentle with memories tender, 
As he mutters a 
prayer for the children asleep, 
For their mother; — may Heaven defend her! 
CHonus.— All quiet, & c. 
The moon seems to shine just as brightly as then, 
That night, when the love, yet unspoken, 
Leaped up to his lips, when low murmured vows 
"Were exchanged, to be ever unbroken; 
Then, drawing his sleeve roughly over his face, 
He dashes off tears that are welling, 
And gathers his gun closer up to its place, 
As if to keep down the heart swelling. 
Cuortus.—All quiet, & c. 
The Picket Guard— Concluded. 
45 
He passes the fountain, — the blasted pine-tree, — 
His footstep is lagging and weary, 
Yet onward he goes, through the broad belt of light, 
To the shade of the forest so dreary. 
Hark! was it the night wind that rustled the leaves ? 
Was it moonlight, so wondrously flashing ? 
It looked like a 
rifle! Ha! Mary, good-by! 
And the life-blood was ebbing and plashing. 
" 
All quiet along the Potomac! 
to-night, 
No sound, save the rush of the river; 
While soft falls the dew on the face of the dead, 
The picket's off duty, forever. 
CHORUS. 
" 
All quiet alcing the Potomac!" to-night, 
No sound, save, & c.

Soothe life's toil, and calm each fear.

COXING HOME TO DIE. 47 
-UNWELCOME winds are sighing 
Within the distant west, 
And wrapped in pain I'm lying, 
With vision-broken rest. 
I 
often dream thy bosom 
Is pillowing my head, 
And wake to find illusion 
Has gathered round my bed. 
But, starting from my dreaming, 
I 
check the rising sigh, 
For I'm coming home to die, mother, 
I'm coming home to die. 
I 
long to see thee, mother, 
And kiss thy dear old cheek; 
I 
feel there is no other 
With whom I 
wish to speak. 
No heart has half such kindness, 
No voice such music's flow; 
Why did I, in my blindness, 
Cause you a 
moment's woe ? 
I 
know you've mourned full often, 
But wipe the glistening eye, 
For I'm coming home to die, mother, 
I'm coming home to die. 
My memory is clinging 
To childhood's sunny hours, 
And sister's voice seems ringing 
Amid the garden flowers. 
The moments seem to lengthen 
As starting hour draws near, 
And hope begins to strengthen 
With thoughts of leaving here; 
So let the heart be gladdened, 
Our meeting hour is nigh; 
For I'm coming home to die, mother, 
I'm coming home to die. 
48 TONY PASTOR'S COMBINATION 
SONG. 
As you walk through the town on a 
fine summer's day, 
The subject of my song you have met on your way, 
On railings and on fences, wherever you may go, 
You will see the penny ballads stuck up in a 
row. 
The titles for to read, you may stop for a 
while, 
And some are so odd they will cause you to smile; 
I've noted them down, as I 
read them along, 
And I've put them all together, to make up my song. 
There was " Abraham's Daughter," " Going out ort a 
Spree," 
With " Old Uncle Snow," " In the Cottage by the Sea;" 
" 
If your foot is pretty, show it " at " Larnigan's Ball," 
And " Why did she leave him" " On the Raging Canawl ?" 
There was " Bonnie Annie Laurie," " With a 
Jockey Hat 
and Feather," 
"I don't think much of you," " We were Boys and Girls 
together ; " 
"Do they think of me at Home ? " " I'll be Gay and Happy 
still," 
"Take your time, Miss Lucy Long," with " The Sword of 
Bunker Hill." 
" 
When this Cruel War is over," " No Irish need apply,"I 
" 
For every thing is lovely," and " The Goose hangs high ; " 
"That Young Girl from New Jersey," " 0, wilt thou be 
my Bride ?" 
And " Oft in the stilly Night," " We'll all take a 
ride; " 
"Let me kiss him for his Mother," " He's a 
gay young 
Gambolier," 
"I am going to fight mit Sigel," and " De bully Lager 
Beer; " 
RALLY RO urin THE FLAG. 
33 
RALLY round the flag, boys! give it to the breeze! 
That's the banner we love, on the land and seas; 
Brave hearts are under ours; let the traitors brag; 
Gallant boys, fire away! and fight for the flag! 
Rally round the flag, boys! give it to the breeze! 
That's the banner we love, on the land and seas. 
Let our colors fly, boys; guard them day and night; 
For victory is liberty; and God bless the right! 
Then rally round the flag, boys! rally round the flag! 
CHORUS. - Rally round the flag, boys, & c. 
Their flag is but a 
rag; ours is the true one! 
Up with the stars and stripes! down with the new one I 
Urave hearts are under ours; let the traitors brag, 
gallant boys, fire away! and fight for the flag! 
Rally round the flag, boys! give it to the breeze, & C. 
CHORUS. — Rally round the flag, boys, & c. 
MOTHER , 
IS THE BATTLE OVER 
P 
M OTHER, is the battle over ? 
Thousands have been killed, they say; 
Is my father coming ? Tell me, 
Have our soldiers gained the day ? 
Is he well ? or is he wounded ? 
Mother, do you think he's slain ? 
If you know, I 
pray you, tell me 
Will my father come again ? 
Mother, dear, you're always sighing 
Since you last the paper read; 
Tell me why you now are crying ? 
Why that cap upon your head? 
Ah! I 
see you cannot tell me; 
Father's one among the slain. 
Although he loved us very dearly, 
He will never come again.

34 I'M 1103IE, 
AND KY RAMBLINGS 
ARE O'ER. 
nom my own native village I 
went on my rambles; 
Being weary of travelling, I 
sat down to rest 
Near the foot of a 
mountain, where sprang a 
clear foun-
tain, 
With bread and spring water myself to refresh. 
I 
heard a 
voice crying, lamenting, and sighing, — 
"0, come to thy home, and thy ramblings give o'er! 
0, think of the hearts that are breaking for thee! 
So come to thy home, and thy ramblings give o'er." 
Cnonus. — I 
heard a 
voice, &c. 
I 
was not fondly dreaming; I'm sure I 
was sane; 
But still that fond voice it seemed hovering near; 
'Twas my wife's, 'twas my Emma's; so sweetly it came, 
Saying, " Thy children's fond prattle dost thou not 
hear ?" 
But still she kept crying, lamenting, S
ze. 
Cuonus. — I 
heard a 
voice, &c. 
I 
picked up my knapsack, raised my hand to the skies, 
And vowed in my heart I 
would wander no more; 
I 
reached my lone cabin, wiped tears from my eyes, 
Saw my Emma and children welcome me to the door. 
Now my ramblings are over, I'll be no more a 
rover; 
For Plenty is smiling round my cabin door; 
No more shall their hearts break in sorrow for me; 
I'm home! I'm home! and my ramblings are o'er. 
CHORUS. 
Now my ramblings, tice. 
OUR BEAUTIFUL FLAG." 
36 
COME, rally, brothers, rally! around the stripes and stars; 
Fighting the odious rebel flag, that flaunts its triple bars; 
A 
banner foul, dishonored, no emblem for the free; 
For this, the bonnie Red, White, and Blue forever more 
must be. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah! hurrah! For a 
nation's rights, hurrah! 
They shall not harm our beautiful flag, nor quench a 
single star. 
We're all a 
band of brothers; we mourn this civil strife; 
Still will we smite the rebel hand that seeks our nation's 
life. 
0, men of sunny Georgia! Brave hearts of Tennessee! 
Ye Texas Rovers ! — raise again the banner of the free! 
CHORUS. — Hurrah, & c. 
Now down with South Carolina! that haughty, treacherous 
State; 
Humble her tyrants in the dust! (forever ignobly great); 
But up with the Southern poor man! strike off the cap-
tive's chain! 
Rally around the starry flag, and sing in loud refrain. 
Cuonus. — Hurrah, &c. 
0, no! the " Bonnie Blue Flag," with one white, 'ghastly 
star, 
Never shall float before our ranks to lead the brave afar; 
But blend the hues of sunset, the bonnie " Red, White, 
and Blue," 
Shall fire our hearts with patriot zeal, with hope and 
courage true. 
CHORUS. — Hurrah, &c.

FLOATING ON THE WIND. 
FLOATING on the wind, 
Songs of other years 
Freshly come to mind, 
Melting me to tears; 
Every breeze that blows 
Seems a 
haunted tone, 
Whispering words like those 
But to spirits known, 
Stealing o'er my mind, 
Melting me to tears, 
Floating on the wind, 
Come songs of other years. 
0, ye mystic songs, 
Blending with the air, 
how my spirit longs 
In your joy to share; 
Where, from harps unseen, 
Music of the mind, 
Earth and heaven between, 
Floats upon the wind. 
Stealing o'er my mind, 
Melting me to tears, 
Floating on the wind, 
Come songs of other years. 
FROM THE RED BATTLE-FIELD. 
SILENTLY, tenderly, mournfully home, 
From the red battle-field, volunteers come; 
Not with a 
loud hurrah, nor with a 
wild eclat, 
Not with the trump of war, come our brave sons from far: 
Gently and noiselessly bear them along; 
Hushed be the battle-hymn, music, and song. 
Silently, tenderly, mournfully home, 
Not as they marched away volunteers come; 
Not with the sword and gun, not with the stirring drum, 
Comes our dead hero home now all his work is done: 
Thoughtfully, prayerfully, bear ye the dead, 
Pillow it softly, the volunteer's J,iead. 
From the Red. &c.— Concluded. 
37 
Silently, tenderly, mOurnfully home; 
Where should the fallen brave volunteer come 
But to his native hills, where the bright, gushing rills, 
Freedom's sweet music fills, and her soft dew distils ? 
Peacefully, prayerfully, lay our brave friend 
Close by the home that he fought to defend. 
Silently, tearfully, welcome the brave; 
Glory encircles the patriot's grave: 
Here let affection swell, here let the marble tell 
How the brave hero fell, loving his country well! 
Silently, tenderly, mournfully home, 
Welcome the volunteers, one by one. 
Is THAT MOTHER BENDING O'ER 
ME ? 
Is that mother bending o'er me, 
As she sang my cradle hymn, 
Kneeling there in tears before me ? 
Say! my sight is growing dim. 
Comes she from the old home lowly, 
Out among the Northern hills, 
To her pet boy, dying slowly 
Of War's battle-wounds and ills ? 
Mother! 0, we bravely battled— 
Battled ' till the day was done; 
While the leaden hail- storm rattled,— 
Man to man, and gun to gun. 
But we failed, and I 
am dying, 
Dying in my boyhood's years. 
There, — no weeping, self-denying, — 
Noble deaths demand no tears. 
Fold your arms again around me; 
Press again my aching head; 
Sing the lullaby you sang me; 
Kiss me, mother, ere I'm dead.

HANNAH'S AT TITF1 WINDOW 
BINDING SHOES. 
Peon, lone Hannah! sitting at the window binding shoes, 
Faded, wrinkled, sitting, stitching, in a 
mournful muse. 
Bright-eyed beauty once was she, 
When the bloom was on the tree. 
Spring and winter 
Hannah's at the window binding shoes. 
Not a 
neighbor passing, nod or answer will refuse 
To her whisper, " Is there from the fishers any news ?" 
0, her heart's adrift with one, • 
On an endless voyage gone. 
Night and morning 
Hannah's at the window binding shoes. 
Fair young Hannah, Ben, the sunburnt fisher, gayly wooes, 
Tall and clever, for a 
willing heart and hand he sues. 
May-day skies are all aglow, 
And the waves are laughing so! 
For her wedding, 
Hannah leaves her window and her shoes. 
May is passing. 'Mong,, the apple boughs a 
pigeon cooes 
Hannah shudders; for the wild sou'wester mischief brews 
Round the rocks of Marblehead, 
Outward bound, a 
schooner sped. 
Silent, lonesome, 
Hannah's at the window binding shoes. 
'Tis November; now no tear her cheek bedews; 
From Newfoundland, not a 
sail returning will she lose: 
Whispering hoarsely, " 0 fishermen, have ye 
heard of Ben ? 
0 
fishermen, have ye heard of Ben?" 
Old with watching, 
Hannah's at the window binding shoes. 
Twenty winters wear and tear the rugged shore she views 
Twenty summers — never one has brought her any news. 
Still her dim eyes silently 
Chase the white sails o'er the sea. 
Hapless, faithful, 
Hannah's at the window binding shoes. 
I'M LONELY SINCE ICY NEOTIIER 
DIED. 
I'M lonely since my mother died, 
Though friends and kindred gather near; 
I 
cannot check the rising sigh, 
Or stay the silent, heartfelt tear. 
Of earthly friends she was the best, 
My erring youthful steps to guide; 
0, do not smile because I 
weep; 
I'm lonely since my mother died. 
• Cmon.us. 
I'm lonely since my mother died, 
Though friends and kindred gather near; 
I 
cannot check the rising sigh, 
Or stay the silent, heartfelt tear. 
You may not deem it brave or strong 
To let these tears so often flow, 
But those who've lost a 
mother's love 
Can tell the pain of thy sad woe. 
Could I 
but call her back again, 
And kneel once more down by her side, 
I'd love her better than before; 
I'm lonely since my mother died. 
CHonus.— I'm lonely, &c. 
0, you who have a 
mother dear, 
Let not a 
word or act give pain, 
But cherish, love her as your life, 
You ne'er can have her like again. 
Then, when she's called from you away, 
Across Death's dark and troubled tide, 
In vain, with me, you need not say, 
I'm lonely since my mother died. 
CHORUS. -
I'm lonely, &c. 
40 SPEED AWAY ! SPEED AWAY ! 
SPEED away! Speed away! on thine errand of light, 
There's a 
young heart awaiting thy coming to- night; 
She will fondle thee close, she will ask for the loved, 
Who pine upon earth since the " Day-star " has roved; 
She will ask if we miss her, so long is her stay, 
Speed away! Speed away! Speed away! 
Wilt thou tell her, bright songster, the old chief is lone, 
That he sits all the day by his cheerless hearthstone; 
That his tomahawk lies all unnoted the while, 
And his thin lips wreathe ever in one sunless smile; - 
That the old chieftain mourns her, and why will she stay ? 
Speed away! Speed away! Speed away! 
And 0, wilt thou tell her, blest bird on the wing, 
That her mother hath ever a 
sad song to sins; 
That she standeth alone, in the still, quiet night, 
And her fond heart goes forth for the being of light, 
Who had slept in her bosom, but who would not stay. 
Speed away! Speed away! Speed away! 
Go, bird of the silver wing! fetterless now; 
Stoop not thy bright pinions on you mountain's brow; 
But hie thee away, o'er rock, river and glen, . 
And find our young " Day- star" ere night close again; 
! 
onward! let nothing thy mission delay, 
Speed away! Speed away! Speed away! 
COME to me love, for here I 
am waiting, 
Sadly and lone, by the dark swelling sea; 
Cold winds are blowing, and strange voices moaning, 
And fast flow the tears of thy Marion Lee. 
0, why dost thou tarry so long on the ocean ? 
My poor heart is breaking in sorrow for thee; 
Come to me, love, for here I 
am waiting, 
And fast flow the tears of thy Marion Lee.

CHORUS. 
Marion Lee! Marion Lee, 
Never again shall his bark ride the billow; 
Marion Lee —  
Concluded. 
41* 
Peaceful he sleeps where the sea-flowers are blooming, 
And mermaids are watching his bright coral pillow. 
Long have I 
watched through the night's gloomy shadows, 
Gazing far out o'er the dark troubled sea; 
Striving in vain, through the mists that are hovering, 
To catch but one glance of thy proud bark and thee. 
0, why dost thou tarry, & e. 
COME WITH THY SWEET VOICE 
AGAIN. 
(By permission of the Publishers, Messrs. Firth, Son, & Co.) 
COME with thy sweet voice again, 
To my heart still dear, 
Laden with soft, soothing pain, 
Like a 
tear, like a 
tear. 
Bright visions, long vanished, 
Round thy melodies beam ;— 
Lulled in the lap of thy sighs, 
Let me dream, let me dream. 
Come again! 
Come with thy sweet voice again! 
Come, 0, come again! 
Come with thy sweet voice again! 
Bring not a 
language that tells 
How the light hours roll; 
Come with the music that wells 
From thy soul, from thy soul. 
Come not with bright offerings, 
Cold, unhallowed, and new. 
Bring but thine own gentle heart, 
Ever true, ever true. 
Come again ! 
Come with thy sweet voice again 
Come, 0, come again ! 
Come with thy sweet voice again!

42 BELLA'S GOOD NIGHT TO THE 
FLOWERS. 
Ix a 
lovely garden darling Bella stood, 
Gazing at the pretty flowers in childish, happy mood; 
Sweet the roses blossomed with the sun's bright ray, 
And the velvet dahlias with the dew-drops play. 
Skipping round from flower to flower my little one did go, 
Clasping with her tiny hands those pure and white as snow. 
CHORUS. 
Nestled in her little bed, I 
watched her dimpled light, 
As in her seeming dreams she said, • 
" 
Good night, pretty flowers, good night." 
Now the morning sunbeams of my life have passed, 
Lessons from those pretty flowers I'll cherish to the last; 
Though they bloom to die, they blossom yet again, 
Emblems of bright heaven, free from care and pain. 
In the troubles of my life my darling childl see, [glee. 
Watching o'er those beauteous flowers in youthful, happy 
"Pretty flowers," still hear her say, " the sun has gone 
away; 
[day." 
Good night, dear ones, I'll think of you, and come another 
CHORUS. — Nestled, &c. 
ANGELS LISTEN WHILE SHE 
SPEAKS. 
Low her voice is, soft and kind; 
Sorrow ne'er appeals in vain; 
She can soothe the troubled mind, 
Bid despair to hope again. 
She is good, and kind, and true; 
Her the weeping mourner seeks; 
Holy words her lips bedew, 
Angels listen when she speaks. 
From her lips but words of truth 
Fanlike manna from above, 
All the innocence of youth, 
All the strength of perfect love; 
Ne'er a 
thought, unkind, unjust, 
Brings the rose-tint to her cheeks, 
Still she bids us hope and trust; 
Angels listen when she speaks.

LIILEANNA. 
I 
KNOW a 
little cot, that is humble as can be, • 
It stands on the bank of Susquehanna, 
When the wild-flowers blow, and the humming-birds 
And them lives my sweet Luleanna. 
She's mild as the eve, she's fair as the dawn, 
She's graceful as the flow of Susquehanna, 
She's my idea of angel on earth, 
The idol of my heart, Luleanna. 
CHORUS.— She's mild as the eve, &c. 
If I 
were a 
fish, I 
would swim by her side, 
When she sails on the bold Susquehanna; 
If I 
were the wind, I 
would whistle through the sails, 
And play with the curls of Luleanna. 
If I 
were any thing else than myself, 
I 
would live nowhere but beside her, 
I 
would dream of her by night, and sing to her by day, 
Till I 
won the heart of sweet Luleanna. 
CHORUS. — 
She's mild as the eve, &c. 
She bathes her cheeks in the morning dew, 
The placid stream is her mirror, 
The pebbles are the jewels she wears in her hair, 
And her carriage is her boat on the river. 
CHonus. — She's mild as the eve, & c. 
KATE O'SHANE. 
THE cold winds of autumn wave mournfully here, 
The leaves round me falling are faded and sere, 
But chill though the breeze be, and threatening the storm 
My heart, full of fondness, beats kindly and warm. 
0 Dennis, dear, come back to me! 
I 
count the hours away from thee. 
Return, 0 
never part again, 
From thy own darling, Kate O'Shane! 
*Twas here we last parted, 'twas here we first met, 
And ne'er has he caused me one tear of regret; 
Though seasons may alter, their change I 
defy; 
My heart's one glad summer when Dennis is by. 
0 Dennis, dear, come back to me! 
I 
count the hours away from thee. 
Return, 0 
never part again, 
From thy own darling, Kate O'Shane!

THE PICKET GUARD. 
" 
ALL quiet along the Potomac!" they say, 
Except, now and then, a 
stray picket 
Is shot, as he walks on his beat to and fro, 
By a 
rifleman, hid in a 
thicket. 
'Tis nothing, — a 
private or two, now and then, 
Will not count in the news of the battle; 
Not an officer lost, only one of the men, 
Moaning out, all alone, the death rattle. 
CHonus. — 'Tis nothing, & c. 
" 
All quiet along the Potomac!" to-night, 
Where the soldiers lie, peacefully dreaming; 
Their tents in the rays of the cold autumn moon, 
Or the light of the watchfires are gleaming. 
A tremulous sigh, as the gentle night wind 
Through the forest leaves softly is creeping, 
While the stars up above, with their glittering eyes, 
Keep watch, while the arfny is sleeping. 
CHORUS. 
All quiet, all quiet, all silent to-night, 
Where the soldiers are peacefully dreaming, 
And their tents in the ray of the clear autumn moon, 
Or the the light of the watehfires are gleaming. 
There's only the sound of the lone §entry's tread, 
As he tramps from the rock to the fountain, 
And thinks of the two in the low trundle-bed, 
Far away in his cot on the mountain. 
His musket falls slack, and his face dark and grim, 
Grows gentle with memories tender, 
As he mutters a 
prayer for the children asleep, 
For their mother; — may Heaven defend her! 
CHonts.— All quiet, &c. 
The moon seems to shine just as brightly as then, 
That night, when the love, yet unspoken, 
Leaped up to his lips, when low murmured vows 
Were exchanged, to be ever unbroken; 
Then, drawing his sleeve roughly over his face, 
He dashes off tears that are welling, 
And gathers his gun closer up to its place, 
As if to keep down the heart swelling. 
CHORUS. — All quiet, & c. 
The Picket Guard— Concluded. 
46 
He passes the fountain, — the blasted pine-tree, — 
His footstep is lagging and weary, 
Yet onward he goes, through the broad belt of light, 
To the shade of the forest so dreary. 
Hark! was it the night wind that rustled the leaves ? 
Was it moonlight, so wondrously flashing ? 
It looked like a 
rifle! Ha ! Mary, good- by! 
And the life-blood was ebbing and plashing. 
"All quiet along the Potomac!" to-night, 
No sound, save the rush of the river; 
While soft falls the dew on the face of the dead, 
The picket's off duty, forever. 
CHORUS. —" All quiet along the Potomac ! " to-night, 
No sound, save, & c.

HOME DELIGHTS. 
HOME delights! Home delights! 
Jewels in Memory's own; 
The sweet little valley, beside the old cottage, 
Made sunshine to brighten my home. 
True, life's changes cross our path; 
True, dear friends have passed away; 
But those happy scenes of youth, 
Cheer each heart, and bless each day.

Caskets of happy spent years. [ace, 
Through seasons of trouble, this gleam of sweet 801-
To youthful remembrance endears. 
Hearts beat warmly with true love, 
Hearts then from deceit were free ; 
The good old fireside scenes of youth, 
Never can forgotten be. 
CHORUS. — Home delights, &e.

Treasures of love-lasting worth; 
The old homestead cottage, and sweet little valley,

Brothers and sisters most dear; 
But those early days of youth 
Soothe life's toil, and calm each fear.

.eld COMING HOME TO DIE. 
UNWELCOME winds are sighing 
Within the distant west, 
And wrapped in pain I'm lying, 
With vision-broken rest. 
I 
often dream thy bosom 
Is pillowing my head, 
And wake to find illusion 
Has gathered round my bed. 
But, starting from my dreaming, 
I 
check the rising sigh, 
For I'm coming home to die, mother, 
I'm coming home to die. 
I 
long to see thee, mother, 
And kiss thy dear old cheek; 
I 
feel there is no other 
With whom I 
wish to speak. 
No heart has half such kindness, 
No voice such music's flow; 
Why did I, in my blindness, 
Cause you a 
moment's woe ? 
I 
know you've mourned full often, 
But wipe the glistening eye, 
Fpr I'm coming home to die, mother, 
I'm coming home to die. 
My memory is clinging 
To childhood's sunny hours, 
And sister's voice seems ringing 
Amid the garden flowers. 
The moments seem to lengthen 
As starting hour draws near, 
And hope begins to strengthen 
With thoughts of leaving here; 
So let the heart be gladdened, 
Our meeting hour is nigh; 
For I'm coming home to die, mother, 
I'm coming home to die.

SONG. 
As you walk through the town on a

On railings and on fences, wherever you may go, 
You will see the penny ballads stuck up in a

The titles for to read, you may stop for a 
while, 
And some are so odd they will cause you to smile; 
I've noted them down, as I 
read them along, 
And I've put them all together, to make up my song.

"Take your time, Miss Lucy Long," with " The Sword of 
Bunker Hill."

When this Cruel War is over," " No Irish need apply,"1 
" 
For every thing is lovely," and " The Goose hangs high ; " 
" 
That Young Girl from New Jersey," " 0, wilt thou be 
my Bride ?" 
And " Oft in the stilly Night," " We'll all take a 
ride; " 
"Let me kiss him for his Mother," " He's a 
gay young 
Gambolier," 
"I am going to fight mit Sigel," and " De bully Lager

THE BANTfER OF l'HE SEA. 
OP 
all the flags that float aloft 
O'er Neptune's gallant tars, 
That wave on high in victory 
Above the sons of Mars, 
Give us the flag, Columbia's flag, 
The emblem of the Free, 
Whose flashing stars blazed through the wars, 
For Truth and Liberty. 
CHORUS. 
Then dip it, lads, in ocean's brine, 
And give it three times three; 
And fling it out, 'mid song and shout, 
The banner of the sea. 
Beneath its folds we fear no fop; 
Our hearts shall never quail; 
With bosoms bare the storm we'll dare, 
And brave the battle gale. 
And, though the cannon plough ouedecks, 
The planks run red with gore, 
Still through the fray all shall obey 
That flag forevermore. 
CHORUS. — Then clip it, lads, & c. 
On every wave, on every shore, 
Columbia's flag shall go; 
And through all time, its fame sublime, 
With brighter hues shall glow. 
For Freedom's standard is our flag, 
Its guardians, Freedom's sons, 
And woe betide the insulter's pride, 
When we unloose our guns. 
CHORUS. — Then dip it, lads, &e. 
Its enemies our own shall be, 
Upon the land or main, 
Its starry light shall gild the fight, 
And guide its iron rain. • 
Nor foreign power, nor treason's arts, 
Shall shake our patriot love, 
While with our life, in peace or strife, 
We'll keep that flag above. 
CHORUS. — Then dip it, lads, &c.

WHEN THE BOYS COME HOME. 61 
[By permission of the Publishers, Messrs. Sawyer & Thompson.] 
THE boys are coming home again; 
This war will soon be o'er; 
The North and South again will stand 
United, as of yore. 
Yes, hand in hand, and arm in arm, 
Together we will roam ; 
0, won't we have a 
happy time 
When all the boys come home! 
Cironus. 
We'll hoist the good old flag again 
Oa Freedom's lofty dome; 
And live in peace and happiness, 
When all the boys come home. 
We'll have no more false hopes and fears; 
No more heart-rending sighs; 
The messenger of peace will dry 
The weary mourner's eyes. 
'We'll laugh and sing, we'll dance and play! 
Ah, wait until they come, 
And joy will 'crown the happy day 
When all the boys come home. 
CHORUS. — We'll hoist, & c. 
How proud our nation then will stand! 
United evermore, 
We'll bid defiance to the foe 
That dare approach our shore. 
We'll.hoist the good old flag again 
On Freedom's lofty dome, 
And live in peace and happiness, 
When all the boys come home. 
CHORUS. — We'll hoist, &c. 
[By permission of the Publishers, Messrs 4 
Firth, Son, & Co.] 
W HEN battle's music greets our ear, 
Our guns are sighted on the foe; 
Then nerve the arm and banish fear, 
And, comrades, touch the elbow! 
CHORUS. 
Touch the elbow now, my boys, 
Comrades, touch the elbow! 
Nerve the arm and banish fear, 
And, comrades, touch the elbow. 
For home and country patriot's fire 
Kindle our souls with fervid glow, 
And Southern traitors shall retire 
When Northmen touch the elbow! 
CHORUS. — Touch the elbow, & c. 
Though many brave men bite the sod, 
And crimson heart's blood freely flow, 
Shout as our spirit soars above, — 
On comrades! touch the elbow! 
CHORUS. —
Touch the elbow, & c. 
Though cannon ball may plough the rank, 
And though it cast a 
deadly glow, 
Fill up the space the ball made blank, 
And, comrades, touch the elbow! 
Cnonts.— Touch the elbow, & c. 
Now show the stuff of which you're made, 
The general signal, " March" Hallo! 
Double the quickstep, Third Brigade! 
Charge! Comrades, touch the elbow! 
CHORUS.— Touch the elbow, & c. 
[By permission of the Publishers, Messrs. Sawyer & Thompson.] 
W OUNDED and sorrowful, far from my home, 
Sick, among strangers, uncared for, unknown, 
Even the birds that used sweetly to sing 
Are silent, and swiftly have taken the wing. 
No one but mother can cheer me to-day; 
No one for me could so fervently pray; 
None to console me, no kind friend is near; 
Mother would comfort me if she were here. 
CHORUS. 
Gently her hand o'er my forehead she'd press, 
Trying to free me from pain and distress; 
Kindly she'd say to me, " Be of good cheer, 
Mother will comfort you, mother is here." 
If she were here with me, I 
soon would forget 
My pain and my sorrow; no more would I 
fret. 
One kiss from her lips, or one look from her eye, 
Would make me contented, and willing to die. 
Gently her hand o'er my forehead she'd press, 
Trying to free me from pain and distress; 
Kindly she'd say to me, " Be of good cheer, 
Mother will comfort you, mother is here." 
CHORUS. — Gently her hand, & c. 
Cheerfully, faithfully, mother would stay 
Always beside me, by night and by day; 
If I 
should murmur or wish to complain, 
Her gentle voice would soon calm me again. 
Sweetly a 
mother's love shines like a 
star, 
Brightest in darkness, when daylight's afar; 
In clouds or in sunshine, pleasures or pain, 
Mothers' affection is ever the same. 
CHORUS. — Gently her hand, &c.

LWi NTYYEARs AGO. 
rVE wandered to the village, Tom, I've sat beneath the 
tree, 
Upon the school-house playground, which sheltered you 
and me; 
But none were there to greet me, Tom, and few were left 
to know, 
That played with us upon the grass, some twenty years ago. 
The grass is just as green, Tom; barefooted boys at play, 
Were sporting as we did then, with spirits just as gay. 
But the master sleeps upon the hill, which, coated o'er 
with snow, 
Afforded us a 
sliding place just twenty years ago. 
The river's running just as still, the willows on its side 
Are larger than they were, dear Tom, the stream appears 
less wide; 
The grape-vine swing is ruined now, where, once we played 
the beau, 
And swung our sweethearts, " pretty girls," just twenty 
years ago. 
The spring that bubbled 'neath the hill, close by the spread-
ing beech, 
Is very low; 'twas once so high that we could almost reach. 
And, kneeling down to get a 
drink, dear Tom, I even 
started so, 
To 
see how much that I 
was changed, since twenty years 
ago. 
Near by the spring, upon an elm, you know I 
cut your 
name, 
Your sweetheart's just beneath it, Tom, and you did mine 
the same ; 
Some heartless wretch has peeled the bark — ' twas dying, 
sure but slow, 
Just as that one whose name was cut, died twenty years 
ago. 
My lids have long been dry, Tom, but tears came to my 
eyes ; 
I 
thought of her I 
loved so well, those early-broken ties; 
I 
visited the old church-yard, and took some flowers to 
strew 
Upon the graves of those we loved some twenty years ago. 
it 
Twenty ;Years Ago — Concluded. 
55 
„ 
Some are in the church-yard laid, some sleep beneath the 
sea, 
But few are left of our old class, excepting you and me; 
But when our time shall come, dear Tom, and we are called 
to go, 
I 
hope they'll lay us where we played, just twenty years 
ago.

DOWN in the canebrake, close by the mill, 
There lived a 
yellow girl, her name was Nancy Till; 
She knew that I 
loved her, she knew it long; 
I'm going to serenade her, and I'll sing this song. 
CHORUS. 
Come, love, come, the boat lies low, 
She lies high and dry on the Ohio; 
Come, love, come, won't you go along with me ? 
I'll take you down to Tennessee. 
Open the window, love, 0, do, 
And listen to the music I'm playing for you! 
The whisperings of love, so soft and low, 
Harmonize my voice with the old banjo. 
CHORUS.— Come, love, come, &c

CHARMING LIZZIE CLAY. 
57 
0 
HAREEMS, come and listen to what I 
have to say: 
Old massa owned a 
purty gal, they called her Lizzie Clay; 
She worked in the house from morn till close of day; 
And every one that knew her, loved my charming Lizzie 
Clay. 
One night we went out walking, to tell our tales of love ; 
She paused, and pointing upward, said, " Just see the stars 
above! 
Says I, " I 
do, my love; why do you ask, I 
pray ? " 
" 
0 
Sam," said she, " I 
hope that we will journey on their 
way." 
CHORUS. 
0, sweet Lizzie Clay, from us you've passed away, 
And left old Sam on earth alone, to weep for Lizzie Clay. 
She went out in the fields one day, and seemed to feel so 
well; 
But soon she was taken sick, the cause we could not tell. 
We brought her to the cabin, the doctor came, 'tis true, 
But she only said, " Farewell, dear Sam; good-by, good-by 
to you." 
The doctor tried his best, but alas, 'twas all in vain, 
For all that he could do would not bring her back again; 
She died without a 
struggle, just at the close of day, 
With all the darkies weeping round the bed of Lizzie Clay. 
CHORUS. — 0, sweet Lizzie Clay, &c. 
We took her from the cabin and laid her in the ground, 
Under the chestnut-tree, beneath the grassy mound; 
We 
raised a 
slab of pine, which stands until this day, 
And on the slab we wrote the name of charming Lizzie 
Clay. 
But now she's gone to heaven, where the angels live, they 
say, 
And left poor Sam on earth alone, to wear this life away. 
But hark, I 
hear a 
voice, which, as it whispers, seems to say, 
" 
Welcome, welcome, poor old Sam, ' tis your long-lost 
Lizzie Clay." 
CHORUS. — 0, sweet Lizzie Clay, & c.

,VESTA MOORE. 
W HEN the golden sun had passed adown the 'west, 
And shadows crept along the shore, 
I 
sat beside the wasted, failing form 
Of my own loved darling, Vesta Moore. 
Her pale cheek rested on her snow-white hand, 
And a 
strange fire lit her deep blue eye, 
And the quiver of the pale and bloodless lip 
Told the sad tale, Vesta Moore must die! 
CIIORTJS. 
Bring flowers, wild flowers, sweet flowers, 
That she loved in days of yore, 
Let them bloom in fragrance round the resting-place 
Of my loved, my sainted Vesta: Moore. 
When I'm gone, and you are wandering here alone, 
0, think of this, our last sad hour, 
And promise me to seek that blessed rest, 
Made by our Father's love and power. 
Then I 
will meet you in that happy land, 
When you reach that peaceful, flowering shore, 
For I 
feel the hour is quickly drawing near 
When you'll lose poor, weary Vesta Moore. 
CHORUS. — Bring flowers, &c. 
When the vesper bell shall toll its holy chime, 
My poor tired spirit will be free; 
The last of earth my sinking mind shall fill, 
Shall be sweet thoughts of thee. 
Take now my dying last farewell, and think 
That I 
am only gone a 
while before; 
That you'll be united in our Father's home, 
With your own loved, happy Vesta Moore. •

THE IRISH JAUNTING CAR. .63 
Do you want a 
car, your honor? Och! sure that's the 
one for you, 
It's an outside, Irish jaunting car, just painted green and 
blue. • 
It belongs to Larry Doolan, and you'll have to travel far 
To find a 
better driver of an Irish jaunting car. 
The fare is fifteen pence, but as the distance isn't far, 
I'll just say one-and-threepence, ma'am, so jump on the 
car. 
If you want to drive round Dublin, sure you'll find me on 
the stand; 
I'll take you to Raheny, to pick cockles on the strand. 
To the Phoenix Bank, to Nancy Hand's, the Monument, 
and then 
I'll take you to the Strawberry Beds, and back to town 
again. 
Get some bread, and beef, and porter, and some whiskey 
in a 
jar, 
That's the way to take your pleasure on an Irish jaunting 
car. 
0, then, if that car should speak, sir, sure a 
moral 'tvrould 
. disclose ; 
It has carried Whigs and Tories, Repealers and their 
foes. 
Yet it looks well by obliging all, and keeps me better far, 
With my whip, my pipe, my pony, and my Irish jaunting 
car.
• 
So, if you want to hire me, call in to Mr. Mahar, 
• 
And he'll send for Larry Doolan, and his Irish jaunting 
car.

PUTTING ON AIRS. 
(By permission of the Publisher, Mr. B. M. Higgins.] 
KIND hearers, will you listen, 
While a 
closing song I 
sing ? 
I've hit upon a 
happy theme--
I 
think the very thing. 
I 
do not wish to mix at all 
In any one's affairs, 
But my opinion is, just now, 
That some folks put on airs. 
There's no use talking, no use talking, 
The truth itself declares, 
If you do as folks of fashion do, 
You've got to put on airs. 
CHonus. 
There's no use talking, no use talking, 
The truth itself declares, 
If you do as folks 
of
,f
ashion 
do, 
You've got to put on airs. 
Now, when a 
girl is " coming out," 
She really thinks she's some; 
A " foreign beau," with a 
big mustache, 
She always welcomes home; 
Two hours before her looking-glass 
To catch him she prepares, 
And when she gets her " fix ups" on, 
0, don't she put on airs! 
Cuonus. 
There's no use talking, &c. 
0, when a 
boy is nearly grown, 
Although he's " nary red," 
'With neither beard upon his face, 
Nor brains within his head, 
He'll patronize the tailor's shop, 
On tick buy all he wears, 
But when he gets among the girls, 
0, don't he put on airs! 
Cnonus.— There's no use talking, & c. 
The politician at the polls, 
Election day will stand, 
And bow, and smile, and wire-pull, 
And shake each voter's hand. 
Putting on Airs— Concluded. - 65 
But when he gets into office, 
Why, that is all he cares; 
He thinks himself important then, 
And don't he put on airs? 
CHORUS. — There's no use talking, &c. 
Then since ' tis -found, the world around, 
All parties think they're right, 
For free men, free speech, and free homes, 
Let North and South unite. 
Then will all foreign powers know 
They can't with us hold shares; 
Our colors true, red, white, and blue, 
Will stop this putting on airs. 
CHORUS. 
There's no use talking, &c. 
CASTLES IN THE AIR. 
THE bonnie, bonnie bairn, who sits poking in the ase, 
Glowering in the fire wi' his wee, round face, 
Laughing at the puffin lowe, what sees he there ? 
Ha! the young dreamer's bigging castles in the air. 
His wee, chubby face, and his towzie, curly pow, 
Are laughing and nodding to the dancing lowe. 
He'll brown his rosy cheeks, and singe his sunny hair, 
Glowering at the imps, with their castles in the air. 
He sees muckle castles, towering to the moon, 
He sees little sodgers pu'ing them all down; 
'Worlds whonabling up and down, bleezing wi' a 
flare,— 
See how he loups as they glimmer in the air! 
For a' sae sage he looks, what can the laddie ken ? 
He's thinking upon naething, like mony mighty men. 
A 
wee thing maks us think, a 
sma' thing maks us stare; 
There are mair folks than him bigging castles in the air; 
ic a 
night in winter may well mak' him cauld; 
His chin upon his huffy hand will soon mak' him auld; 
.His brow is brent sae braid; 0, pray that Daddy Care 
Would let the wean alone wi' his castles in the air. 
He'll glower at the fire, and he'll keek at the light, 
But mony sparkling stars are swallowed up 
by ni

Aulder e'en than his are glamoured by a

Hearts are broken, heads are turned, with castles in the air.

Sleep forever and forever.

IN DE LOUISIANA LOWLANDS . 
W AY down in Louisiana, not many years ago, 
There lived a 
colored gemblum, his name was Pompey 
Snow; 
He played upon de banjo, and on de tambourine, 
And for rattling ob de bones, he was de greatest eber seen, 
In de Louisiana lowlands, low. 
CHORUS. 
In de Louisiana lowlands, low, 
In de Louisiana lowlands, low. 
One night ole Pompey started off to play for Cwsar Clum, 
But afore he went he fortified wid a 
god, stout glass ob 
rum ; 
When on de road he thought he saw a 
darkey tall and grim, 
So Pompey laid de banjo down, to break de darkey's shin, 
In de Louisiana lowlands, low. 
CHORUS. — In de Louisiana lowlands, low. 
Says he, " Ole chap, jus' move along, or else I'll spoil your 
face !" 
But dis darkey didn't seem to move from out his hiding-
place; 
So, drawing back, he crooked his head, and down at him 
cachunk; 
But Pompey made a 
sad mistake ; — 'twas nothing but a 
stump! 
In the Louisiana lowlands, low. 
CHORUS. — In de Louisiana lowlands, low. 
The stump, it proved a 
little hard, — too hard for Pompey's 
wool, 
For when he struck, the hickory knot went through the 
darkey's sktill; 
They found his banjo by his side, and Pompey lying dead, 
(Spoken.— And, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first 
time it was ever known of a 
darkey's coming to an end,) 
By breaking ob his head, 
And dey buried him in de lowlands, 1019.

THE IRISHMAN. 
The Irishman —  
Concluded. 
73 
THERE was a 
lady lived at Leith, 
A 
lady very stylish, man, 
And yet, in spite of all her teeth, 
She fell in love with an Irishman; 
A 
wild, tremendous Irishman; 
A 
great, red-headed Irishman; 
A 
tearing, swearing, thumping, bumping, 
Ramping, roaring Irishman. 
His face was no ways beautiful, 
For with small-pox ' twas scarred across, 
And the shoulders of the ugly dog 
Were almost double a 
yard across: 
0, the lump of an Irishman! 
The whiskey-devouring Irishman! 
The great he-rogue, with his wonderful brogue, 
The fighting, rioting Irishman. 
One of his eyes was bottle-green, 
And the other was out, my dear; 
And the calves of his wicked-looking legs 
Were more than two feet about, my dear. 
0, the great big Irishman! 
The rattling, battling Irishman ! 
The storming, ramping, swaggering, staggering, 
Leathering swosh of an Irishman. 
He took so much of Lundy Foot 
That he used to snort and snuffle, 0, 
And in shape and size the fellow's neck • 
Was as bad. as the neck of a 
buffalo. 
0, the horrible Irishman! 
The thundering, blundering Irishman! 
The slashing, dashing, smashing, lashing, 
Thrashing, hashing Irishman. 
His name was a 
terrible name indeed, 
Being Timothy Thady 
And whenever he emptied his tumbler of punch, 
He'd not rest till herd filled it full again. 
The boozing, bruising Irishman! 
The 'toxicated Irishman! 
The whisky, frisky, rummy, grummy, 
brandy, no-dandy Irishman. 
This was the lad that the lady loved, 
Like all the girls of quality; 
And he broke the skulls of the men of Leith, 
Just by the way of jollity. 
0, the leathering Irishman ! 
The barbarous, savage Irishman! 
The hearts of the maids, and the gentlemen's heads, 
Were bothered, I'm sure, by this Irishman. 
THE JOCKEY HAT AND FEATHER. 
As I 
was walking out one day, 
Thinking of the weather, 
I 
saw a 
pair of roguish eyes 
Beneath a 
hat and feather. 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
It made my heart pit-pat; 
Then, turning round, she said to me, 
"How do you like my hat ?" 
CHORUS. 
"0," I 
said, " it's gay and pretty, too, 
They look so well together, 
Those glossy curls and jockey hat, 
With a 
rooster's feather." 
She wore a 
handsome broadcloth basque, 
Cut of the latest fashion, 
And flounces all around her dress, 
Made her look quite dashing. 
Her high-heeled boots, as she walked on 
The pavement, went pit-pat. 
I'll ne'er forget the smile I 
saw 
Beneath that jockey hat. 
(Spoken.) 
She kissed her hand, said " au revoir," 
- Then I 
was a 
goner; 
Before I'd time to say " good-by," 
She was round the corner. 
I 
tried that night, but could not sleep, 
So up in bed I 
sat '•  
And right before my face, I

THE MUSICAL HUSBAND. 
How I 
wish that my husband would let me alone, 
And not want me always to play; 
0, I've never a 
minute to call my own, 
I'm playing and singing all day. 
How well I 
remember the night we first met 
At Lord Mornington's concert and ball, 
When he asked me to join in his Lordship's quartette, 
With himself and Sir William McHall. 
When I 
think of the concerts to come, I 
despair ; 
0, ladies, of musical husbands beware! 
"Now' Harry, my love, let me fini
sh 
this 
screen 
I've begun for my sister's bazaar." 
"Impossible, Mary! for Parry I've seen,' 
And he begs you will learn Hope's Bright Star.' 
I've invited a 
few here for Wednesday night, 
And Lord Francis will join you with me 
In singing ' Sweet Evening' and ' Beautiful Sprite,' 
His second's so good in a 
glee." 
When I 
think, & c. 
I 
seldom can get to the nursery now, 
For practising fills every hour; 
I've never seen Susan or Willy, I 
vow, 
Since Wednesday evening at four; 
For if ever I 
enter the school-room, to hear 
How much they have pleased Madame Lisle, 
; 
My husband comes in with, " Now, Mary, my dear, 
Come and practise Herz's newest quadrille.' 
When I 
think, & c. 
He says that it's time for Louisa to play, 
Though she's yet only four years old! 
He'll take her to Kialmark's concert to-day, 
And she's got such a 
dreadful bad cold. 
She went to hear Grisi on Saturday night, 
And was frightened to death at Lablache; 
She told me this morning she hated the sight 
Of Ivanholl's horrid mustache. 
When I 
think, & e. 
Last June, on my birthday, his cadeau he gave 
Another new harp and guitar, 
Though I •hinted before, that I 
wanted to have 
A 
tiara like Madame St. Maur; 
But, alas! no tiara I'm likely to see 
If this taste of my husband remain; 
The money he spent in reprinting his glee, 
Makes me fancy he's really insane.

THE MISSUS TOOK A SLY GLANCE 77 
AT ME . 
Mx friend and neighbor Johnson called on me some time 
ago, 
If I 
to Brighton for a 
week would go, he wished to know. 
As town was getting dull just now, the trip would do us 
good; 
I 
needed no persuasion, so I 
promised that I 
would. 
At that moment, in the room my good lady chanced to 
come, 
And, judging from her features, she'd no wish to stay at 
home. 
" 
It's agreed, old boy," said he, " for a 
week we'll have a 
spree ;" 
But just then the missus took a 
sly glance at me. 
As soon as he had left, I 
racked my brain for an excuse 
For keeping her at home, but I 
found it was no use. 
At every invention, ingenuity, or wile, 
I'd Brighton but to mention, and she checked me with a 
" 
I'd some business to do." " How lucky! I'll go too — 
Apartments that would do for one, would be enough for 
two." 
" 
But there's Johnson, he'll make three." " Let him take 
his wife," said she; 
And just then the missus took a 
sly glance at me. 
For fear she'd be suspicious, I 
gave her my consent, 
And off to Mrs. Johnson in a 
hurry then she went. 
They both persuaded Johnson, and thus about it came, 
That we took our wives to Brighton, to watch our little 
game. 
But we gave them both the slip, when we took our morn-
ing dip, 
And looked at bathers through a 
glass instead of a 
ship. 
I 
little thought that she so close to me could be; 
I 
turned, and found the missus took a 
sly glance at me. 
Men may think that they are clever, and I 
verily believe 
That half of them imagine women easy to deceive. 
But in overweening confidence, if one imagines that 
lie's a 
match for any woman, he is certainly a 
flat. 
Now, I 
know my way about, of that there's not a 
doubt; 
But there's no one like a 
woman to worm a 
secret out. 
If I'm bent upon a 
spree, how cautious I 
should be, 
For I'm " done" if once the missus gets a 
sly glance at me.

HEAVILY falls the rain, 
Wild are the breezes to-night, 
But 'neath the roof, the hours, as they fly, 
Are happy, and calm, and bright; 
Gathering round our fireside, 
Though it be summer-time, 
We sit and talk of brothers abroad, 
Forgetting the midnight chime. 
CHORUS. 
Brave boys are they! 
Gone at their country's call; 
And yet, and yet, we cannot forget 
That many brave boys must fall. 
Under the homestead roof, 
Nestled so cozy and warm, 
While soldiers sleep with little or nought 
To shelter them from the storm, 
Resting on grassy couches, 
Pillowed on hillocks damp; 
Of martial fare, how little we know, 
'Till brothers are in the camp. 
CHORUS. 
Brave boys, & c. 
Thinking no less of them, 
Loving our country the more, 
We sent them forth to fight for the flag 
Their fathers before them bore. 
Though the great tear-drops started, 
This was our parting trust, — 
"God bless you, boys! we'll welcome you home 
When rebels are in the dust." 
CHORUS. — Brave boys, &c.

May the bright wings of love 
Guard them wherever they roam; 
The time has come when brothers must fight, 
And sisters must pray at home.

Soon to be strown with graves! 
If brothers fall, then bury them where 
Our banner in triumph waves. 
CHORUS. — Brave boys, & c. 
"Youm blessing, dear mother, ere I 
fall asleep, — 
It may be my last, where your loving watch keep,— 
The angels around me seem hovering near 
Whenever your blessing falls sweet on mine ear; 
With morning's first dawn I 
must up and away 
To scenes where stern duty is pointing the way. 
When it leads me in danger, in hours of distress, 
I 
shall think of this hour; and thy tenderness 
Will linger in memory to brighten the day 
That cheerless will seem when from thee far away; 
But the soft wind of evening, when the stars glimmer 
bright, 
May waft me your blessing, your sweet good night. 
Awaking at morning, should you call in vain 
For me, who would spare thee one moment of pain, — 
Remember I 
could not part, seeing you weep, 
And, early departing, I 
kissed you asleep. 
My mother, my country, for thee will I 
fight; 
I 
know that in time God will prosper the right. 
Be cheerful, be hopeful, and calm, should you hear 
I 
fell on the battle-field; others as near 
Will fall there; but then, 0 
remember this night! 
Your blessing will linger in memory as bright. 
Now once more your blessing, so sweet to my ear, 
And then, may God bless you, my mother, dear!

I'M TURNING GRAY, 
DEAR

KATE .

TIME'S hand iS even there, sweet Kate, 
Yet let the sign remain ; 
It gives me no regretful throb, 
Nor should it yield thee pain. 
'Tis very white, I 
grant thee, Kate, 
Yet pluck it not, I 
pray ; 
'Why should thy loving heart regret 
That I 
am turning gray ? 
Ypur lustres, too, have ta'en their flight, 
Since thou and I 
first met, 
And darkened moons have sped since then,, 
And murky suns have set; 
Yet light from that warm heart of thine 
Has been around my way, 
And with so dear a 
guide and friend 
I 
would again turn gray.

Why should thy loving heart regret 
That I

The wife may view with unconcern 
Time's signet on the brow, 
Who never gave the wearer's heart 
A 
single throb of woe; 
And if angelic worth, sweet Kate, 
Might keep the curl at bay, 
Time ne'er had placed in triumph there 
His banneret of gray. 
Then let the stranger live, sweet Kate, 
Amid its neighbors dark, 
Until they too, in time, shall pale 
Beneath the spoiler's mark, 
'Tis very white, I 
grant thee, Kate,

pray;

That I

DOWN BY THE RIVER SIDE I 
STRAY. 
[By permission of the Publishers, Messrs. Firth; Son, & 
DOWN by the river side I 
stray 
As twilight shadows close, 
And the soft music of the spray 
Lulls Nature to repose: 
Beside the stream a 
maiden dwells, 
My star of eventide, 
Pure as the water-lily bells, 
Pure as the water- lily bells, 
Pure as the water- lily bells, 
Down by the river side. 
Down by the river side I 
own 
A 
treasure worth the sea, 
In one, to all the world unknown, 
Who's all the world to me. 
Soon, in her early bloom and grow, 
She is to be my bride, 
Where the sweet water- lilies grow, 
Where the sweet water-lilies grow, 
Where the sweet water-lilies grow, 
Down by the river side. 
THE BLIND GIRL. 
THEY say the world is beautiful, 
More fair than thoughts of love; 
And nightly comes an angel hand, 
That writes in gold above; 
But, ah ! ' tis viewless all to me 
As the softly breathing wind: 
cannot see those beauteous scenes, 
For I 
am blind; I'm blind! 
I 
never saw the bird that sings 
So sweetly to my ear, 
Nor snowy shroud that winter weaves 
Around the dying year. 
All Nature is a 
sealed book, 
'Whose clasp I 
cannot find; 
'Twas never meant for me to read, 
For I 
am blind; I'm blind!

But, ah! they tell me, far away, 
In bright eternity, 
There is a 
land o'-erspread with flowers, 
Which every eye can see; 
Where skies are ever soft and blue, 
And silver streamlets wind. 
Oh! when I 
reach that holy shore, 
I 
shall no more be blind. 
WE ARE GROWING OLD 
TOGETHER. 
[By permission of the Publishers, Messrs. Firth, Son, Sc CO.] 
WE 
are growing old together, thou dearest of the dear; 
The morning of our life is past, and evening shades appear; 
Some friends we loved are in their graves, and many are 
estranged, 
But, in sunshine or in shadow, our hearts have never 
changed. 
We are growing old together, thou dearest of the dear; 
The morning of our life is past, and evening shades appear. 
We are growing old together; the ivy and the tree 
A 
fitting emble,m tis, dear, of the love 'twixt you and me; 
To be worthy of each other in the past was all our aim, 
And ' tis pleasant now to know, dear, our hearts are still 
the same. 
We are growing old together, thou dearest of the dear; 
The morning of our life is past, and evening shades appear. 
We are growing old together, together may we die; 
Together may our spirits soar to our home beyond the sky; 
For we loved as few can love, dear, when life's flowery 
paths we ranged, 
And though we've wandered long here, our hearts have 
never changed. 
We are growing old together, thou dearest of the dear; 
The morning of our life is past, and evening shades appear.

THE earth has many treasures rare 
In gems and golden ore; 
My heart hath one, more precious far, — 
The ring my mother wore. 
I 
saw it first when I, a 
child, 
Was playing by her side; 
She told me then 'twas father's gift 
When she became his bride. 
I 
saw it oft in Sorrow's hours, . 
Which marked the after years, 
When, shining on the soft, white hand 
That wiped away my tears. 
And, 0! I 
saw it once again, 
When, on her dying bed, • 
She lifted up her hand in prayer, 
And laid it on my head. 
Beside that bed, where fell my tears, 
The ring to me was given; 
She placed it on my hand, and said, 
" 
We'll meet again in heaven!" 
I 
kissed the cheek I 
oft had pressed, 
From which the rose had fled, 
And, bowed with grief, stood motherless, 
Alone, beside the dead. 
Among the blessed, in realms above, 
Where sorrows are unknown, 
0, may I 
meet my mother dear, 
No more to weep alone. 
Her dying words of love and faith 
I'll cherish evermore 
Within the heart which holds so dear 
The ring my mother wore.

Dm you ever go into an Irishman's shanty ? 
Ah, there boys you'll find the whiskey so plenty! 
With a 
pipe in his mouth, there sits Paddy so free, 
No king in his palace is prouder than he. 
(Chorus.)— Hurrah, my honey! 
(Spoken.)— Now, boys, one for Paddy! 
(Sung.)— Whack! Paddy's the boy. 
There's a 
three legged stool, and a 
table to match, 
And the door of the shanty is locked with a 
latch; 
There's a 
nate feather mattress, all bursting with straw; 
For the want of a 
bedstead, it lies on the floor. 
(Chorus.)— Hurrah ! my honey; 
(Spoken.)— Now then, boys, one for the mattress! 
(Sung.)— Whack ! Paddy's the boy. 
There's a 
neat little bureau, without paint or gilt, 
Made of boards that were left when the shanty was built; 
And a 
three-cornered mirror that hangs on the wall, 
But divil a 
picture's been in it at all. 
(Chorus.)— Hurrah ! 
my honey; 
(Spoken.)— Now then, boys, one for the picture! 
(Sung) — Whack! Paddy's the boy. 
He has three rooms in one 
kitchen, bedroom, and hall; 
And his chest— it is three wooden pegs on the wall; 
He's two suits of old clothes, ' tis a 
wardrobe complete, 
One to wear in the shanty, the same in the street.

(Spoken.)— Now then, boys, one for the old clothes! 
(Sung.) - -Whack! Paddy's the boy. 
He's a 
pig in the sty, and a 
cow in the stable, 
And feeds them on scraps that's left from the table; 
They get sick if confined, so they roam at their ease, 
And go into the shanty whenever they please.

(Spoken.) — Now then, boys, one for the pig! 
(Sung.) — Whack I 
Paddy's the boy. 
There is one who partakes of hi § sorrows and joys; 
Who attends to the shanty, the girls, and boys;

On the willow tree, 
Sat and rocked, I -heard him sing: 
Singing, Aura Lee,

Maid of golden hair, 
Sunshine came along with thee, 
And swallows in the air. 
CHORUS. 
Aura Lee, Aura Lee, 
Maid of golden hair, 
Sunshine came along with thee, 
And swallows in the air. 
In thy blush the rose was born, 
Music' when you spake, 
Through thine azure eye, the morn, 
Sparkling, seemed to break. 
Aura Lee, Aura Lee, 
Birds of crimson wing 
Never song have sung to me 
As in that sweet spring. 
CHORUS. — Aura Lee, &c. 
Aura Lee! the bird may flee, 
The willow's golden hair 
Swing through winter fitfully, 
On the stormy air; 
Yet if thy blue eyes I 
see, 
Gloom will soon depart, 
For to me, sweet Aura Lee, 
Is sunshine through the heart. 
CHORUS. — Aura Lee, &c. 
When the mistletoe was green, 
'Midst the winter's snows, 
Sunshine in thy face was seen, 
Kissing lips of rose. 
Aura Lee, Aura Lee 
Take my golden ring! 
Love and light return with thee, 
And swallows with the spring.

The winters come and go, 
The wind sweeps past with mournful cry, dear Paul, 
And pelts my face with snow; 
But there's no snow upon the heart, dear Paul, 
'Tis summer always there; 
Those early loves throw sunshine over all, 
And sweeten memories dear. 
I 
thought it easy to forget, dear Paul, 
Life glowed with youthful hope; 
The glorious future gleamed yet, dear Paul, 
And bade us clamber up. 
They, frowning, said, " It must not, cannot be; 
Break now the hopeless bands ! " 
And, Paul, you know how well that bitter day 
I 
bent to their commands. 
I've kept you ever in my heart, dear Paul, 
Through years of good and ill; 
Our soils could not be torn apart, dear Paul, 
They're bound together still. 
I 
never knew how dear you were to me 
'Till I 
was left alone; 
I 
thought my poor, poor heart would break the day 
They told me you was gone. 
Perhaps we'll never, never meet, dear Paul, 
Upon this earth again, 
But there, where happy angels greet, dear Paul, 
You'll meet Lorena there. 
Together up the ever-shining way 
We'll press with hoping heart; 
Together through the bright, eternal day, 
,,And never more to part.

Where Afric's sunny fountains roll down their golden sand; 
From many an ancient river, from many a

They call us to deliver their land from Error's chain. 
What though the spicy breezes blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle, 
Though every prospect pleases, and only man is vile ?
