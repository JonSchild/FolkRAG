Thought 
“Thought is like a cloud 
You can see through shadow to see nothing 
But you can see shadow 
When it touches something you know, 
Like that cloud’s shadow 
Touching the Wolf Teeth Mountains. 
When the clouds touch the mountain’s top 
Or where it is high 
The wind is good 
When you’re among the clouds 
Blurred ground among fog, 
You are close to He Who First Did Everything,” 
Said my Grandfather Owns Painted Horse. 
We are but nomads asking for nothing 
But the blessings upon our Mother Earth. 
We are born as someone new 
So then 
We have to be taught 
The good from the bad. 
What is good, we want you to know. 
What is good, we want you to use, 
In the way that you are a person.
