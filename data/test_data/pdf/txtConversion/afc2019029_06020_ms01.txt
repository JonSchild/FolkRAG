[00:00:00] Brief introduction; Beau James Ferguson (“Handsome Beau James,” “Beau James”) 
describes basic personal background information including his date of birth, his hometown of 
Kingsport, Tennessee and his current place of residence in Fall Branch, Tennessee.  
 
[00:02:19] Ferguson begins by explaining his own personal connection to the world of 
professional wrestling. “There’s not a time that I do not remember it.” Ferguson’s grandparents, 
parents, and cousins had deep ties with the local wrestling scene as referees and wrestlers. 
Ferguson mentions that a love for wrestling is often referred to as “being born with the sickness.” 
He shares a short story about telling his kindergarten class that he wanted to be a wrestler when 
he grew up.  
 
Ferguson remembers attending a number of live events starting at an early age. Ferguson offers 
an extremely detailed history of the formation of wrestling territories, promotions, and notable 
wrestlers throughout the south. The United States was originally divided into several smaller 
wrestling “territories,” which belonged to a promoter or booking office. Ferguson grew up 
attending matches hosted by the Knoxville (Tennessee) territory and the Charlotte (North 
Carolina) territory. He also watched televised programming from the Memphis (Tennessee) 
territory and the Lexington (Kentucky) territory.  
 
Territory programs were used as fundraising arms for local organizations. Ferguson notes that 
the parks and recreation departments in Kingsport and Johnson City, Tennessee were almost 
entirely funded by money raised through wrestling events. Similarly, funding for police 
department equipment was also raised by local promotions. “Pro wrestling is interwove into 
central Appalachia.”  
 
[00:09:01] As territories began to disappear, independent professional wrestling promotions 
began to form. Ferguson mentions that until the mid-1990s indie wrestling was “looked down 
upon from other people in the business.” Its association with “outlaw” wrestling (i.e. promotions 
that existed outside the governing body of the National Wrestling Alliance). “The business was a 
closed society until the late-80s, early ‘90s.” Ferguson blames the questionable quality of indie 
promotions during this time on the lack of proper training and business management. Ferguson 
compares indie promotions to a VHS tape that has been copied multiple times.  
 
Ferguson discusses the “revolution” that happened on the independent scene during the 1990s as 
a result of wrestlers who had wrestled for both the NWA and the indies. These more experienced 
wrestlers began offering assistance to struggling promotions.  
 
[00:12:22] Ferguson describes his career path towards becoming a professional wrestler. In the 
1980s, Walmart opened a store in east Tennessee. Ferguson’s mother worked at Walmart, and 
Ferguson’s older cousin, who was also a wrestler, sold his brand of candy at Walmart. As 
Walmart began to expand across the state, Ferguson’s mother was responsible for setting up 
grand opening celebrations, which ultimately booking famous local wrestlers for appearances.

As a result, Ferguson’s family got into wrestling shows for free, which allowed him to become 
acquainted with the wrestlers.  
 
[00:15:27] Ferguson tells the story of meeting Ronnie West, a “world-class, world-famous 
referee” and territory general manager, who encouraged Ferguson to start wrestling. West calls 
Ferguson’s mother and asks if he can hire Ferguson to help promote the territory, set up the ring, 
hang posters, and sell merchandise. “So wrassling’s the only thing I’ve ever done, ever known.”  
 
[00:18:44] Ferguson clarifies that very few reputable training schools existed when he first 
became a professional wrestler. Most “schools” only sought to make a quick profit or discourage 
interested parties. He provides an example of how one of these sessions would be run by 
promoters. Ferguson once again stresses that the industry was a closed society with workers who 
wanted to “protect the business.” “You had to be born into the business or recruited into the 
business.” Gaining trust was important. Wrestlers spoke openly around Ferguson.  
 
Ferguson describes working for “Big Al Bass,” another local independent promoter, at a show in 
McPheeters Bend, Tennessee. Ferguson was tapped to be a last-minute referee. “I was terrified, 
but the Lord opened the door right there.” Ferguson became a full-time referee. Within months, 
“Big Al” recommended that Ferguson, who was 16 at the time, takes over as manager for the 
promotion. Ferguson continued taking referee bookings but felt he could run a stronger 
promotion. “So in January of ‘91, we planned to run our first wrassling event. February 16th, 
1991.” Ferguson had no intentions of running this promotion full-time, but soon he was booking 
well-known indie stars. “I knew they were people who could teach me the business.” Ferguson 
refers to them as “professors.” 
 
[00:28:58] Ferguson discusses a particularly terrible match, which led him to wrestling in-ring 
for the first time. “Wrassling schools are a new thing.” Ferguson recommends several trustworth 
training schools in the central Appalachian region.  
 
[00:31:51] Ferguson takes issue with the term “character” in reference to who he is in the 
wrestling ring. He makes little to no distinction between who he is in everyday life and who he is 
as a professional wrestler. “I come from a time and place where we were real. And we sell real.” 
“The term ‘character’ implies we are playing.” He likens that ideology to a rehearsed Broadway 
play. “I’m Beau James 24/7.” Ferguson laments that this approach has created issues in his 
personal relationships, but he also credits his immense success to his dedication to this practice.  
 
[00:34:18] “I can’t convince you that wrassling’s real, but I can convince you I’m real.” 
Ferguson explains how he forms relationships with fans both in and out of the ring. “If you’re the 
realest person in the room, you have the most attention.” Ferguson values authenticity and 
keeping his word. Characters and “play-wrestlers” lack truth. Ferguson thinks that audiences also 
form connections with people they “believe in.” 
 
[00:37:19] Ferguson muses on what makes Appalachian wrestling fans unique. “Violence. It’s in 
our DNA. It’s in our make-up.” Ferguson provides a social, cultural, and historical commentary 
on the Appalachian region’s perceived predilection towards riot and revolt. “They’re violent

people. They’re good people, but there’s a point you don’t cross ‘em.” Insider versus outsider 
mentality. Ferguson tells the story of beloved Tennessean wrestler Ron Wright, “the greatest 
Appalachian heel of all time. Bar none.” Wright was stabbed at a riot after an intense match and 
had to be taken to the hospital. Ferguson tells several additional stories of violence perpetrated 
by southern crowds. “I’ve had fans come at me with mop handles, pocket knives, tasers, 
blackjacks, chairs, anything they can pick up.” The resiliency of the Appalachian spirit.  
 
[00:44:40] Ferguson charts the evolution of his wrestling promotion, Southern States Wrestling. 
“It was set up to be one night, and after I got through that night I thought, ‘You know what? I 
can do this.’” Ferguson’s prior knowledge allowed him to start booking events as fundraisers. 
Word spread about Fergusion’s promotion. He continued to learn from his “professors,” and the 
promotion eventually expanded running shows in several surrounding states. Ferguson touches 
on the oversaturation of the wrestling market. SSW ran full-time from 1991-2004 (i.e. several 
live shows and television tapings per week/month). “It’s harder now to make money at wrassling 
than it ever was.” Now SSW operates as a fair and festival promotion. Thanksgiving and 
Christmas event to benefit homelessness.  
 
[00:49:58] Ferguson talks about the process of piecing together a card (i.e. event line-up). “I go 
from the ending to the beginning.” Ferguson provides several examples of concurrent storylines 
that ultimately culminate in a championship match. Programs are shaped in a pyramid. “Personal 
issues draw money.” Ferguson loves seeing his creative vision come to fruition. He expounds on 
the different types of bookers and promoters, and Ferguson likens himself to a “puppetmaster.” 
There is a formula for crafting a successful event at a fair or festival. “The babyface (i.e. “good 
guy”) wins. Period.” 
 
[00:57:36] Ferguson offers insight into both the challenging and rewarding aspects of running a 
promotion. “The grind. It’s mentally, physically, emotionally draining.”  Ferguson takes issue 
with the term “show day.” Finding a respectful “crew” that understands Ferguson’s vision has 
been difficult. Philanthropic rewards and being able to support community efforts. He uses his 
wrestling promotion as a religious ministry.  
 
[01:02:30] Ferguson outlines traditions, vocabularies, and rituals found throughout the world of 
professional wrestling. “Speaking wrassler” in reference to specialized coded language. Ferguson 
lists wrestling terms. “It takes years to learn how to speak wrassler.” Ferguson refers to it as a 
“dying artform.” Relatedly, “kizarny” is another type of language. Unspoken rules for making 
towns. Ferguson struggles with adhering to the strict rules of wrestling on which he was raised 
and allowing time for personal relationships. Ferguson missed both his older sister’s and younger 
sister’s weddings. “Luckily, my family understands it.” 
 
[01:07:27] Ferguson discusses building a brand around Beau James and Southern States 
Wrestling. “King of Kingsport” is Ferguson’s brand. “Everywhere I go, people know who I am.” 
He tells a story of being recognized in Portland, Oregon. Ring jackets with Beau James’ name. 
Social media as overcrowded platforms. The pressure to come up with creative ideas. Ferguson 
building an empire to pass along to his great-nephew.

[01:10:18] Ferguson draws comparisons between the current independent scene and the Wild 
West. “Anybody can do anything right now.” He hopes the coronavirus pandemic will force 
wrestlers and promoters to reevaluate what matters most to them. Contemporary promotions as 
too fixated on pageantry and silliness, which obscures the true nature of professional wrestling. 
“My dead friends went to their graves protecting this business. My heroes are either dead, or 
they’re broken down because they protected this business.” 
 
Ferguson returns to the impact the coronavirus has had on the wrestling industry. “It’s crippled 
us. It’s put us out of business.” Promotions brainstorming new ways to run promotions in unique 
venues.  
 
[01:15:40] Ferguson reminisces on his strongest matches and those he used as learning 
opportunities. “I’m proud that I’ve wrestled my heroes.” Selling out events and performing in 
front of his hometown. He also mentions the neverending struggles and heartache. “The Lord has 
blessed me with a tremendous, crazy, stupid life.” 
 
[01:21:23] Ferguson gives advice to those interested in becoming professional wrestlers or 
promoters. “Do not do it.” Ferguson recommends having another career or hobby to fall back on 
if wrestling doesn’t pan out. He touches on the dedication of fans throughout the Appalachian 
region. “You can call yourself a wrassler, but if you can’t pay the bills with it, you’re not a 
wrassler.” Using gifts as an entertainer to help people in the community. Total dedication to the 
sport means “sacrificing your life.”  
 
[01:33:42] Closing remarks. Ferguson thanks those who have offered support over the last 30 
years. “Without you, I would have never had it.”
