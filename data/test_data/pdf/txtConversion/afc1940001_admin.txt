CALIFORNIA FOLK MUSIC PROJECT COLLECTION OF TRADITIONAL MUSIC IN
CALIFORNIAInstructions to Workers
The purpose of this undertaking is to collect and preserve the old-time music now in circulation in
California, particularly the songs which are fast disappearing and which, for the most part, have
never been printed or even written down, but have been passed on from one perer to another by
rote. "California" folk music is understood to mean any traditional music, -- song or dance tune, --
now current in California; items from other states which deal with California life or history may be
included. The investigation is not of course to be limited to perers whose native language is English.
The minority groups in California have much to add that is of great interest.
We want to preserve a song:1) If it was widely current at an time, known to and sung by many
people;2) If it has been known to several generations in a family;3) If it is an account of a true
happening, with local details and place names, even if it was not known widely; or if it tells about the
early days in general (lumber camps mining camps, the crossing of the plains; crimes, catastrophes;
any local trade;)4) If it is a special favorite and particularly good fun to sing.
We want to know what instruments are found in this region, and where any unusual ones may
be examined; also names and addresses of perers on any folk instrument, particularly fiddlers
who play for dances in the old fashion, and 5-string (not tenor) banjo players. Please note general
type of instrument, and mention any odd feature about construction or perance which struck you
particularly.
Local pride in the preservation of the cultural things that belong to the old days should be stimulated
wherever possible, particularly in the minority groups. Remember that the Anglo-Saxon music which
we are inclined to think of as the only "American" kind is a relatively recent importation on this
continent, exactly as the Hungarian, Finnish and Armenian folk musics are. The Portuguese and
Spanish have been in California three times as long as the "Americans".
It is a good idea to spend much time making friends among the older people who are likely to know
songs or to have friends who know them. Don't feel that time spent in conversation about things
apparently quite unconnected with songs is wasted, for it will make you seem less a stranger. A few
AFCCC-ADMIN http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_admin
minutes of general conversation (don't scorn the weather as a topic!) should 9 always precede any
explanation of the reason for your visit. A casual friendly, unhurried manner is disarming; a busy,
efficient one creates suspicion.
When yo find someone who knows a few songs, explain that the University of California is interested
in seeing that they aren't lost, and ask him if he'd feel like making out a list of the titles, just to see
how many songs he can remember, and which ones. If he will dictate the words to you, tell him you'll
make up a typewritten booklet of them and give him a copy. Do not menton recording on disks until
specifically told to do this by the Supervisor.
Never judge a folk-singer by the tonal beauty of his singing. If the tune is fairly definite and the words
reasonably clear that is all that is necessary for our purposes. Often the singing that sounds most
curious to our ears is the oldest and most valuable to preserve. It is important for the collector to
realize that in the mind of a true folk-singer the song is of every importance, the singer of none at all.
Never admire a perance, only the story of the song or the line of the melody.
Sometimes it is necessary, in order to keep your singer's goodwill, to take down songs that aren't
particularly interesting, simply because they are favorites of his. Often, too, it is necessary to take
down one that has been published, though the singer does not know this because he; probably,
learned it by rote. Don't scorn such songs, their variation from the printed version is very interesting
to students, and they should be noted down carefully. In every case we want the singer's own
version of words and tune, so never correct him.
In going to call on "foreign" Californians it is almost always necessary to go in company with
someone known to your performer, -- someone in whom he has confidence and whom you have
interested in your project ahead of time. This should be a person able to understand your work in
its historical and social aspects; so that if your performer suspects you of attampting to exploit his
music commercially, your sponsor for the contact will be able to reassure him effectively. Never ask
foreigners directly for the date of their arrval in the United States. Even when they are in this country
legally they are often uncertain of their status and this query may ruin your contact. Usually the
approximate date is easy to determine indirectly.
Your call should always have the aspect of a social visit; not a business one. Remember that
'foreign' manners are usually more formal and in general more cnsistent than ours; so be on your
best behavior! Don't press people; treat them as collaborators. On the other hands don't allow a
performer to feel that he is doing you a personal favor by allowing you to take down his songs. The
undertaking requires hard and concentrated work from both of you, and the best attitude for you is
AFCCC-ADMIN http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_admin
to assume that he will be glad to make the effort to get a more complete record of the history of old-
time things; just as you are.

The interview forms which follow should be studied carefully to clarify in your mind the various
things we are interested to know. You are not expected to fill these out in full for every performer,
but insofar as any of this information is obtainable in general conversation, without more than a
few direct questions, it should be included on these forms. A performer's interest should not be
exhausted in answering questions since it is infinitely more important to record his music. Never fill
out these forms in the presence of the performer.

General queries:
I. Pencil (4H) or ink only for handwritten cards? Blue-black ink? Indian ink? immaterial
II. Authors: In folk song collections we have followed (on cards enclosed) the indication on the title
page, saying 'collected by' when the title page does (viz: Eleanor Hague, Spanish American Folk
Songs) and saying merely 'by' if that is what the title page does, (Louise Pound; Barry, Eckstorm and
Smyth). Is this right? Yes
III. Punctuation: Please check carefully and indicate proper usage of commas and periods on this
kind of card. My information here is contradictory.
IV. How much of the original shall we duplicate on a continuation card, when information cannot all
be included on a single card? Please illustrate. ???
V. Refrains: Please look up the 4 versions of The Elfin Knight in the Barry, Eckstorm and Smyth
collection British Ballads from Maine, and tell me what you think the refrains should be, particularly
with reference to version B.
We took "Let every rose grow merry in time." This changes to "merry and fine" which might equally
well be used. The last line: "You shall be a true lover of mine" would seem to have equal rights with
the other two; but I chose the first, since the latter is identical with the title and the first would seem
to be bibliographically more useful. Is this the proper criterion? In the same way in Version A, I took
the 2nd (and 5th) lines as the refrain instead of the 4th and 5th, because the 4th line is like the title.
Does this seem right?
2
AFCCC-ADMIN http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_admin
There are so many patterns for refrains in folk songs. When is a refrain a chorus? I suppose
weshould avoid technical literary considerations and must stick to the cataloging of the lines which
[[repeated?] through?] [yes?] a song and are therefore useful bibliographically. [(Sometimes this will
be a first line, sometimes a last line, sometimes two lines together.) [md] called ?] (I am referring to
[repeated sections?], chorus or refrain, not to verses. Of course we will catalog the first line of the
first verse in every case.[) first ?]
A Chorus [ is?] a refrain! ([Colloquialium?])
Queries on cards enclosed:
I. British Ballads from Maine: We made a separate card for the Child title, since Barry's book has an
index of these; then a card for the performer's title of each of the several versions, (4 versions o of
the item cataloged as a sample). In Barry's text the performer's titles as distinct from Child's, is given
in quotes. Should we imitate this?
II. Next we made two cards identical with the performer's title card, as above, with text of first line
added above titles 3 spaces to left, on one card; text of refrain added above on the other in the same
way. Should we say 'Every rose grows merry and fine, f.l. of' --- and 'Fum-a-lum, etc., refr. of' -- as we
have done? Or should we omit the 'f.l.of' and 'refr. of'?
Foreign language titles:We shall not be doing many of these except for Spanish and Mexican songs.
With reference to the cards made for one title from Eleanor Hague's Spanish-American Folk Songs:
I. Title card (in Spanish, or whatever the original language is). I put the English in parenthesis because
Miss Hague supplies it in her index.
3
Then I made a title card in English, with the Spanish title in parenthesis.
Then I repeated this performance for the first line in English, with the Spanish in (); then in Spanish
with the English in (), treating the Spanish title as the main title for the first line cards. This would
have been repeated for the refrain had there been one. Had the English translation of the title been
[unavailable?], not given and we were able to supply it, should this have been done in brackets [] [] in
the block instead of ()?
How should one indicate the language of the country of origin of the song? I put Sp. for Spanish
preceding the translation of the title and first line but it looks odd, though the S. P. library has cards
that look like this.
