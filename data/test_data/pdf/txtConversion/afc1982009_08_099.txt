1-12 The alter call...a request to 
step forward to dedicate your 
life to christ....to become 
a member of the flock.... 
The reasons may differ from 
church to church because of doctrine. 
Akers first request for souls to 
be saved brought only a pre-teen 
youth. He switched his call to 
bring all good Christians..." 
brothers and sisters in Christ" forward. 
This filled the tent's alter 
with shouting, shaking, waving 
old time Christians for a time of 
getting under the spirit....and 
the laying on of hands for healing 
and the bring on of the power.

is under the eves has been that 
way "for a very long time" Although 
on a PM tape Pruitt points out 
that the church was purches from 
a Black AME group in the 1920's. 
The church is located near the Black

At the time the church was used by
