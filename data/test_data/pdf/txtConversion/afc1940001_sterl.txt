STERLING'S HOTEL This is an old song I heard a man sing in Jennings ?, Wisconsinabout 1905; written
about a little hotel on the banks of thw Wolf Riverand the river drivers written this song. I heard it
sang once.
There's old Mollie Hogan who cooks from a book ; She's the chief chamber maid and a pastry
cook,The pies that she bakeses, good God, how they do smellA dog wouldn't eat them at Sterling's
Hotel.There is old Jack MacKysick who cuts wood for his board,But dishes instead? wouldn't work
if he couldThe fish that he catches, good God, how they smell,A dog wouldn't eat 'em at Sterling's
Hotel.And old Astarks who work in the saloon,The drinks that he gives youcould hold in a spoon,For
these little drinks he charges like Hell,And he gets all the money 'round Sterling's Hotel.All our beds
they are crumby with bugs and with lice,And holes in the wall seem to vomit the mice,A nd the
breeze from the pantry has an old rotten smellThat revives all the boarders at Sterling's Hotel.
That's about all I have gotten of this song. That's allI remember. Pat Ford from Wisconsin, at
[Central?]Valley, California, 1938 Sterling's Hotel This is an old song I heard a man sing in Jennings (?),
Wisconsin,about 1905; I heard it sang once. (In 1905 P at was a very smallchild! Either he is repeating
his father's remarks about thesong or he got the date wrong.) It's written about a little hotelon the
banks of the Wolf River, and the river drives written thissong.

[Warde?], maybe you donot remember this?? It would be nice it youdid, though, as this is the kind of
complaint that men workingall over the U.S. have made, half in fun and half serious, abouttheir bed
