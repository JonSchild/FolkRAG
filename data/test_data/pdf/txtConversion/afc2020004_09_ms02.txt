[Deborah A. Miranda reads "Indigenous Physics: The Element Colonizatium"] 
 
Deborah A. Miranda:  Thinking about “Indigenous Physics,” I am a little surprised, because it’s 
not the kind of poem I usually write. I usually write something that is very lyrical, or has a 
narrative of some kind. I like storytelling. I like to be able to feel the microcosms of emotions. 
Thinking about how to, in many ways, retell a story. I spent much of my life living in a world that 
tried to erase me from it. And it was storytelling, it was writing, that pulled me out of it. So I’ve 
always followed that thread, that has been a thread that has continued to give me a great deal 
of strength in this world.  
 
So I think one of the things that happened with this poem was that I had just finished reading 
Dian Million’s book, Therapeutic Nations, and that book had a tremendous impact on how I saw 
healing from a kind of historical trauma. It was really interesting to me that Dian Million took 
this idea of historical trauma—which has been very empowering for many Native people—and 
she wrote a book that is all at once a scathing indictment of western psychological treatment of 
Indigenous trauma, and a powerful assertion of Indigenous ways of healing and knowing. 
Somehow in this book, Dian Million manages to master the kind of English that the academy 
requires, while at the same time infusing that language with Indigenous passion and empathy 
and anger. I felt like a part of my heart had been unlocked.  
 
So, in this poem, the tone, the voice, is very didactic, it’s like an insecure professor’s lecture to 
undergrads—maybe deceptively so—or maybe it’s a kind of futuristic report from an 
Indigenous scientist who seems to be trying to talk the talk of Western science, give that 
Western jargon to his audience, or her audience, around this newly discovered element of the 
periodic tables—“Colonizatium.”  
 
I’ve always been a lover of people of color futurism, especially what Grace Dillon calls 
“Indigenous Futurisms.” Cherie Dimaline’s The Marrow Thieves, Daniel Heath Justice’s Kynship 
Chronicles, the film Blood Quantum, Joanne Barker’s art—it makes me happy to read about or 
see Indians in the future. It seems like medicine, after generations of seeing Indians 
represented across every medium as dead or dying or living in such pain that we wish we were 
dead, right? So Indigenous futurism is about survivance, hope, sovereignty.  
 
Imagining the future of this world from an Indigenous perspective and experience results in 
massively different tools and outcomes. Science, for example, has long been this Western, 
white, Euro-American-centric field—and so, a very limited slice of what the future of a diversely 
populated world might look like is what we see when we read mainstream futurism. The 
possibilities that Indigenous experience brings to a future are astounding. And, of course, 
writers like Linda Hogan (Chickasaw) and Robin Kimmerer (Potawatami) have created poems 
and essays that express exactly that—the epistemologies, the Indigenous ways of knowing, 
ancient and powerful connections between what the natural world gives us, and the medicines 
we need to heal ourselves, heal the earth—what the non-Indigenous Western world has always 
called science. 
 
So I’m interested in that kind of border-crossing. But even more than that, an understanding 
that we already have everything we need to heal from trauma, and to heal our world from 
trauma. There is no miracle needed, no scientific discovery—instead, we need to re-learn what 
we already have in our hands, re-learn how to use the tools we’ve already been given that will 
take us into the future.  
 
So, Indigenous Physics. I wanted to write my way into a new way of seeing historical trauma, 
and of seeing a way through it. My family on my dad’s side came through the California 
missions: Mission Carmel, Mission Soledad, and Mission Santa Ynez. These missions were part 
of a systemic colonization of California by the Spanish and later Mexican governments and they 
lasted from 1769 to about 1835. In that short amount of time, maybe 70 years, the Indigenous 
peoples from Sonoma to San Diego suffered horribly. The deaths, alone—unimaginable—over 
90 percent of the population perished from a combination of what that enslavement brought 
with it: European diseases, physical beatings and torture, psychological warfare, malnutrition 
and starvation, and of course, a kind of deep despair. It was genocide, though that word hadn’t 
yet been invented. Following the end of the mission era, the few survivors were subject to out-
and-out extermination, to use the governor of California’s own word; between Mexican 
ranches and American land-grabs both before and after statehood, California’s Indians were left 
with multiple generations of trauma imbedded in our psyches. It affected every aspect of our 
lives: our mental health, our economic health, our ability to form healthy relationships with 
spouses and children and family members. Friends. My grandfather Tom Miranda was one of 
about 20,000 California Indians out of one million who survived missionization and/or 
colonization. And it’s not as if the trauma suddenly stopped when he was born in 1903; it just 
continued to transform itself into new kinds of violence: racism in education, employment, 
medical care, housing. And of course, we internalized all that, and turned it against ourselves 
and against each other. 
 
All of this thinking came together in this poem. I wanted to trace back in time not just the 
sources of our trauma, but the sources of our healing. I wanted to take what Dian Million says 
in her book and make it real: “We are not our trauma,” she says, “We can work at healing 
without being victims. We can be damaged and still be sovereign.” I love that quote. And I 
wanted the poem to say, here is our future: the tools of story, of dance, of song, and of 
dreaming, these are the seeds of the future. They will lead us where we need to be. They do the 
work that will help us transform the toxins of colonization into the strength necessary to bloom, 
to become nurturers, and to thrive. As I said, for me, writing has always been that thread of 
survivance—storytelling, whether it’s in fiction, prose, poetry or sometimes a mix of them all—
it’s allowed me to rewrite myself into the world, it has given me roots that anchor me, it has 
helped me create community and be a better mother, a better daughter, a better wife, a better 
grandmother. That’s why the poem’s final lines are, “Start with story. Work your way home.” If 
you own your own story, that’s a beginning, and survival is all about beginnings.
