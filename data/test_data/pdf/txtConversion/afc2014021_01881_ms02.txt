Terry Luther interview, 2015-02-13 : interview conducted by Michael Robert
Bussel and Sonia De La Cruz
INTERVIEW LOG
00:01:06:  Name is Terry Luther.  Lives in Florence, Oregon.  Born in Sacramento, California in 
1955.
00:01:27:  Other jobs:  costumer theater company in California, started a theater company in 
Oregon, was a tree planter and hoedad in Eugene, Oregon in the late 1970s.
00:02:38:  Caregiver at age 14.  Had job at Roseburg, Oregon Veterans’ Hospital as librarian.  
Caregiver for her autistic son for last 24 years and paid for her caregiving for last two and 
one-half years.
00:03:32:  Caregiving not different from other jobs.  We are all caregivers when we open 
avenues for another human being.
00:04:14:  Special skills:  no judgments or preconceived notions.  Happy people are able to let go
of themselves and are able to serve.  If you are happy, it is easier to be a caregiver.
00:06:00:  Learned from her father who had polio.  If you care and are nurturing, it is your 
calling.  Went to institute for children with autism and took classes.  Learned to let go of the 
outcome and just play.
00:07:31:  Started her own program.  People around her son didn’t like it.  
00:08:24:  On mission to teach people that we’re all the same.  Everything is possible if you let 
go.  In room with her son one-on-one for 90 days.
00:09:46:  Taking my son out and integrating him one of best challenges I’ll ever have.
00:11:06:  Son mimics what man did who yelled at him.  No resistance...if her son lays on floor 
and screams, it is fine.  Everyone learns.  Truth teaches itself.  Lets her son be.

00:12:39:  Son asleep at midnight, up at 4:00 am, back to bed at 7:00 am, up later.  Food, diet, 
cleaning, bed-making.  14 hours of constant activity.  Must let go of my day.  Logs 316 hours a 
month.  “Sleep is overrated.”
00:14:20:  Finds respites for herself:  IPod, listens to music, takes nap, must take care of 
yourself.  20-60 tantrums a day at one point.  Trips to Portland.  What you give your child is right
there.
00:15:59:  Parents get lost, rely on drugs to deal with children.  Holistic, naturopathic is her 
approach.  If you take care of yourself, kids and family will be fine.  Don’t be a victim.  Ask for 
help.  Caregivers will say they don’t need anything, they’re fine.
00:19:42:  Does mentoring from Florence to Kenya.  Potty training an issue for people she 
consulted with in Kenya.  Common daily experience is non-existent.
00:22:04:  Happiness is the key.  Choose happiness and embrace it.  Everybody can learn it.  
Need to create whole society of people saying “Rain Man.”
00:23:41:  Most people look at disability as a life sentence.  We are here to be happy and survive.
00:25:40:  Stay present in moment.  Most gratifying place you can ever be.  Just my ego that 
thinks I have to do it all.  Son went to restaurant in Coos Bay.  Takes no drugs or medicine but is 
pure and authentic.  Don’t need anything else.
00:28:17:  Could change the world with autistic kids if we took the approach of being happy.  
Love what you got, got what you love.
00:30:36:  Only challenge I face is myself.  Need to be authentic.  Challenges are self-fed.
00:32:05:  Union got me on payroll.  Had been only getting paid for two-three hours per day.  
Now getting paid for her work.  Without union, she and her husband would be working until they
are 80.  Savings can now go into trust.  Son has a future.  Union has changed our lives.
00:33:50:  Union liked her energy.  She is a union delegate and runs local chapter.  Has 12-14 
people who call her.  Union brings ability to share stories and our work.
00:36:07:  ABC did documentary that featured her son’s story.  Was once on radio station in New
York, where she spoke about autism.  Establishing eye contact is one tool.  Beginning of 
significant change in our lives.
00:38:28:  Son will teach anyone to “humble themselves.”  Just do whatever it takes.

00:40:10:  Took away all electronics when she started.  Become isolated in caring for child with 
autism.  At first was fighting to be with her son.  Your child will tell you what they want.
00:42:58:  To be a whole person, help someone else.
00:43:25:   Parents killed by drunk driver when she was 24.  Saw people coming back from 
Vietnam destroyed.  Have to remind people what we are here for.
00:46:00:  Makes wreaths with shells, collect glass floats, draws, paints, sings, play piano.  Peeks
with all these lenses.
00:49:55:  Gratitude for sharing.  What you do can make a difference.  Cites case of Kenyan boy.
One little thing at a time is success.
00:51:26:  Wants people to know they should get rid of preconceived notions regarding autism 
and disability.  Don’t judge.  Please ask, don’t react.
00:54:13:  End of interview.
