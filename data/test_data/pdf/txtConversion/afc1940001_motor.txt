THE MOTOR CAR MAMMAWhen a motor car mamma the road rules abuse [md] And how they
influence the language we use!Get a grip on yourself [md] motor mamma is thereYou may try
for a smile [md] your reward is a stare.Don't trifle with mamma or try to get gay!Step on it, get
going [md] you hear some one sayA motor car mamma [md] sing tra la [lal?] laShe's stepped on
the gasso [md] Get out of the way!Here a street full of traffic has shut off the gasFor a freak on
a corner has sounded a blast.No! no gentle policeman, 'twas a fierce traffic cop.No, 'twas [non?]
engine trouble that caused them to stop.A mamma, Ah! mamma, a beautiful carIt moved on so quiet
it carried no jar.The wheels were of wire, the tires balloonIt had only been purchased that same
afternoon.With a wheel [lose?] near ninety, the body light greenSuch a wealth of gold tresses, so
calm and sereneIt was raining like tomcats and the street all [aslop?],For she just passed a corner
and came to a stop.She had heard the shrill warning and slipped out the clutch,Reversed the gear
quickly, a little, not much.And the heart of that copper was made of a rock,Tho the smile of the
mamma shown around for a block.That copper near worshipped at loves' gentle shrineAnd you
guess human kindness makes [flappers?] divine.For she tried, oh, so gentle that cop to film flam,With
the [semaphores?] blinking [md] a heck of a jam.Well, a great open space left in that coppers
domeSo she felt for the throttle her thoughts were of home.Wit a slight vibration, her motor's not
deadAnd her heart was a-flutter, she had one 'tis said.Now he gave her a ticket, sign [md] here is the
space,But she reached out and pushed him, he fell on his face.I'll arrest you, you hussy; was the last
words he said.For she stepped on the gasso and now he is dead./And he lay where he fell, so he fell
where he lay.The traffic department, of course, stopped his payAnd it isn't no riddle, if motors run
slow[;?]Don't argue with mamma, but watch her gas toe.So traffic policemen take warning in timeOr
you'll soon be out yonder where blossoms entwine.Be nifty, go fifty; don't be a babboon, or your
checkWill be cashed by some other draggoon.
