Summary of Interview: Sandy Stearns describes her 47 years of experience as a nurse. She says 
she began as a CNA and then worked as an RN in several hospitals and programs, including 
psychiatric, children’s, AIDS, and dementia. She emphasizes a desire to pursue work with the 
disenfranchised and states she always wanted to make a difference. As a teacher and dean of 
nursing, she sees a need for more faculty and more diversity in the field. She is allied with the 
Wisconsin Center for Nursing and advocates for trade schools as a path to nursing.

Introductions 
0.00.24 
Grew up in NE Milwaukee, in poor Polish Catholic neighborhood. Catholic and 
public high school. Lived in Milwaukee area for entire life. Attended UW-
Oshkosh, beginning 1968. First in family to go to college; parents had not 
graduated high school. Nursing program at Oshkosh had just started; third class to 
graduate. On graduation, was told options were to be nurses, social workers, or 
teachers. Was given white collars to wear on graduation, because of being 
women. 
0.02.15 
Worked in cardiac nursing for years. Returned to graduate school in 1987, getting 
master’s degree in nursing administration from Marquette. Never planned on 
being education. At the time, many nurses were getting MBAs (as opposed to a 
Master’s in nursing). Was glad to have gotten master’s instead, because had to 
have this degree because a state regulation required this for teaching or 
administration. 
0.03.31 
Income doubled after graduation, because could get a job in nursing 
administration (even though had been nurse manager); degree opened many 
doors. 
0.04.04 
Was manager of a step-down unit at St Francis and gave notice because of a new 
vice-president of nursing. 
0.04.40 
Had three kids (ages 3, 5, and 7) when returned to graduate school. Found it 
initially challenging to think about doing graduate work when taking grad school 
entry exams. 
0.05.23 
Feels a deep sense of spirituality and that decisions are guided in a certain way. 
0.05.43 
Realized during work that needed to get master’s degree to progress; had initially 
found the prospect “a bit nuts”. But confluence of family and work events 
eventually propelled interviewee to return to grad school. 
0.06.33 
Initially paid for a semester at Marquette and worked nights and weekends to 
make ends meet. Nominated by a professor for scholarship in second semester; 
was very surprised and overjoyed to receive it; was followed by a fellowship for 
next two semesters. Allowed interviewee to complete grad school without debt 
Page 2 of 8 
 
that would have been difficult to take on. Achieved long-time goal of graduating 
with master’s before 40. 
0.08.27 
Chose nursing because mother had been very sick when interviewee was young, 
with uterine cancer. Stayed home at school at 11 years old to care for mother and 
took exams from home or in the evenings. Mother survived multiple surgeries. 
Father later went blind in one eye, and later recovered. These experiences made 
interviewee feel that she wanted to take care of people. “Most people in nursing 
you talk to have some sort of history in their family, or that personal thing: 
somebody’s helped them, or they’ve seen people—that’s a common theme we 
hear with our students too. That’s why they do it. The students who come in and 
want to make a lot of money, they don’t last.” 
0.10.01 
Oshkosh at the time was very competitive. As third class through the school, was 
not yet accredited. But interviewee was unaware of this at the time. Because of 
this, there was very little variation in what students could take, and the 
atmosphere was highly competitive. In freshman year, had unwanted sexual 
harassment/assault experience with professor. Interviewee, who felt very sheltered 
and inexperienced, felt in shock. Found it difficult to change section to avoid 
professor, to some degree because of how this would set interviewee back in the 
competitive environment. Interviewee’s father made an appointment with 
administrator to discuss situation, after which student was able to change classes. 
After this, received an A in class. Gave interviewee insight into how vulnerable 
Title IX complainants can be.  
0.15.31 
Of 105 entrants, only 35 graduated. After freshman year, wrote essay on why 
wanted to be a nurse; only top 50 were selected. 
0.15.50 
Had community clinical experience, and psych at Winnebago. Found it a very 
interesting experience. Had to buy longer skirts for psych ward, because 
otherwise typically wore street clothes. Felt that some male patients saw student 
nurses as opportunity to ‘give hard time to.’ Felt this was “such a different world 
in clinical. It starts hitting you how much responsibility you have. It’s just kind of 
scary.” 
0.17.35 
Enjoyed med surge (medical surgery) most of these clinicals. But goal was to be 
pediatric nurse; however, didn’t have a great deal of experience in this at the time. 
At children’s hospital, new nurses worked nights, and student nurses would work 
with them. Interviewee felt this was not ideal and found pay too low. Also 
considered job at VA, but weekend workload would be onerous. Took job at St 
Luke’s, and loved this job; had many unusual experiences, including care for 
early heart transplant patient. 
0.19.03 
At time interviewee took first job, there was a shortage of nurses. Feels that 
nursing demand comes in cycles—sometimes a glut of nurses, sometimes a 
shortage. Current situation explained by aging population and insufficient faculty, 
so mismatch between demand for nursing places and ability to train up new 
nurses. A required ratio of one faculty member with at least a Master’s in nursing 
per eight students; this an onerous requirement, in order to graduate nurses with 
the required clinical training. Many nurses are getting nurse practitioner training, 
but this is a higher paid position, and so incentive to do this rather than work as 
faculty. 
Page 3 of 8 
 
0.21.57 
Decided to teach (from earlier job in administration) because “wanted to make a 
difference in the world”. Started as part-time faculty member. Was shocked that 
salary was less than half of salary of nursing administrator; had to take two part-
time jobs to supplement. ANEW (Administrators of Nursing Education in 
Wisconsin)—organization with which interviewee involved—working to 
reimburse nurses to get master’s degree in nursing so that they can be in a 
position to teach. Associate’s degree RNs are paid the same as bachelor’s degree 
RN—same degree, same board exams. These faculty would also be able to teach 
in the Associate’s degree programs. Complicated political work to get this scheme 
approved. 
0.26.13 
On first job: “When I graduated, we were still wearing hats. Because I was from 
Oshkosh—a new program—you could tell in those days from your hats where 
someone went to school. The Oshkosh hats looked like a peace symbol. We were 
really proud of those hats.” Had been CNA at St Luke’s prior to being a nurse. 
Had only brief orientation. “I felt overwhelmed. And I remember the first time I 
had a woman come out of the room about her husband, and said ‘Nurse, nurse, my 
husband needs you.’ And I turned around to look for the nurse—and it was me. 
Oh my god, it’s me. And he was having a heart attack. And I did okay—he 
survived. But I remember at the time thinking, ‘Oh my god, it’s me. You gotta do 
it.’” At the time, worked all three shifts, and because of unpredictable shiftwork, 
often sleep-deprived. Felt there was a lot of camaraderie and working together. 
Not a lot of competition and a lot of helping each other and teamwork. 
0.28.45 
Felt that nurse manager was a mentor, although some of the older nurses “weren’t 
as nice”. Now called ‘lateral violence’ or ‘lateral bullying.’ An old phrase about 
‘nurses eating their young’ felt apropos. Felt that working with heart surgeons 
was a “nightmare.” With fewer limitation on their behavior, these doctors “ran the 
show” and could decide which hospital patients would go to. “And so, the 
hospitals backed the doctors and not the nurses.” The nurse manager was only 42, 
had had breast cancer and four kids. Took on and mentored all the new nurses.  
0.30.41 
A typical day: “It was pretty busy. You got report and then you ran. You just ran 
the whole time. And so, you’d never get on time. A lot of times I worked p.m. on 
Friday nights, and if you were lucky, you’d get out at 11.30, and then you’d have 
to be back at 7 the next morning.” Had to start own IVs and didn’t have today’s 
pumps; had to use own watch. Worked in cardiac medicine for 15 years. At the 
time was engaged, although fiancé died soon after, possibly from Agent Orange; 
although no one knew this at the time. Didn’t initially want to work at St Luke’s 
because of this traumatic experience at the hospital and a misdiagnosis. Felt 
afterwards that on returning was able to make friends and had a good support 
system. 
0.33.50 
Worked for a long time, partly for marital/family reasons; felt that these to some 
degree interacted with career. 
0.34.34 
Impetus to go to grad school was working as nurse manager at St Francis and 
realizing that progress required master’s qualification. New payment system 
introduced related to length of patient stay. In late 80s, PPS passed. People were 
transferred “sicker, quicker.” Example: a father in his 80s, with children in 
60s/70s, would be discharged to their care. ‘Sub-acute’ started around that time, 
Page 4 of 8 
 
because nursing homes weren’t ready for such sick people. This was 
interviewee’s specialty, and then after grad school specialized in work with sub-
acute, long-term care, and dementia. At the time, not a great deal of expertise in 
how to deal with dementia: in retrospect, giving people drugs and tying them 
down regrettable.  
0.37.01 
Interviewee did some research on dementia care and discovered that better 
outcomes were tied to nursing interventions (activities, music, etc.) as opposed to 
drug or other medical interventions. Such research led to change in ethos around 
care for dementia patients. 
0.37.42 
As Director of Nursing (DON) was initially surprised by article recommending 
‘untying the elderly’. Initially worried about this because of worries about patient 
safety; now seems obviously the best course. 
0.38.13 
Huge changes during interviewee’s working career. Started AIDS unit at St 
Camillus in 90s. Cryptosporidium bacterium had “hit the water” in Milwaukee 
around this time; causes explosive diarrhea; affected AIDS patients and elderly 
care. Without bottled water, tried to give patients water from faucet. Only then 
started bottling water. Around same time, HIPPA was started. People had been 
previously discriminated against, especially the HIV-positive, because of their 
medical records being looked up. Record-keeping much laxer at the time; 
example: interviewee had her weight recorded informally on admittance for labor. 
0.40.51 
“AIDS, we didn’t really know what that was. We didn’t know what we were 
dealing with. We were dressed liked we were going to the moon, because we 
really didn’t know what we were dealing with.” At the time, difficult family 
dynamics between partners and families of the predominantly male population of 
patients. When power of attorney regulations for care and finances changed, 
situation changed to some degree.  
0.42.19 
Started AIDS clinic because “I liked working with the disenfranchised—working 
with people who others didn’t want to work with … I just felt there was such a 
need, to have people who are not judgmental. And I learned so much from it—I 
really grew as a person.” Interviewee also volunteered in anonymous STD testing. 
At clinic, staff had T-shirts and fundraisers (e.g., a picnic and shows) in gay 
neighborhood. At one time, won a raffle for a party at a lesbian bar; had money 
donated to AIDS ministry. Loved how the atmosphere at this time was “fun and 
not judgmental;” feels there is often too much judging of people. 
0.44.52 
Later felt that “bubble was burst in belief in people” after an embezzlement 
situation at St Camille’s. 
0.45.25 
One patient at a support group at which interviewee volunteered gave interviewee 
a cactus plant. Later re-encountered this patient at another HIV-related funeral; 
patient had had successful anti-viral treatment. Interviewee was delighted, given 
that so many had died during this time. 
0.46.42 
Felt the situation was compounded by people being so sick that they were unable 
to work, anti-virals were so expensive, and Medicaid wouldn’t pay for this. “It 
was just a vicious cycle.” 
0.47.10 
Interviewee felt that her first husband’s death—“he died in my arms and I took 
care of him”—helped her deal with the difficulty of dealing with many deaths 
during this period. Felt that spiritual life also helped a great deal. Worked in 
Page 5 of 8 
 
hospice care—this was last job in nursing. Feels that the care involves looking at 
the person holistically, helping them and family die with dignity and free of pain; 
learned this after experience of caring for first husband in final stages of life. 
“People who don’t understand hospice nursing think we’re overdosing them or 
we’re killing them. But we’re not—they need that. The doses you end up giving 
them are so huge, but that’s because they have so much pain.” Feels that questions 
of addiction don’t arise, since the care is already taking place at end-of-life stage. 
0.49.30 
“I remember we had this one patient who came in who had kidney and heart 
disease. She was just full of fluid. So, she was on a salt-free diet—doesn’t that 
sound terrible? … She was admitted, and I asked, ‘What can we get you?’ and she 
wanted some saltine crackers. So, we gave them to her, and she was eating them 
like they were Godiva chocolate—like they were the best thing she’d ever had in 
real life … The next day she died—not because of the crackers—but, well, thank 
God she got to have some salt. It’s like, the crackers didn’t kill her—she was 
dying. And it was like, why are we doing this? It’s just craziness So we were 
feeling better.” 
0.50.28 
At the time at St Francis a lot of tube feeding—an involved and difficult process 
that also distressed interviewee. Part of going back to grad school was to “get a 
handle on this.” Did a lot of research thinking about whether not tube-feeding 
would be ‘starving’ them—feeling that patient’s systems were already shutting 
down. Was also interested in how to think about this from the Catholic 
perspective.  
0.51.24 
Another patient had an only son, and feeding was very difficult—even 500 cc’s 
was too much and would prompt gurgling. But son would not discontinue care. 
Son wanted cryogenesis for patient. Interviewee felt distressed by this—felt that 
90-year-old patient should die with dignity, especially because patient would try 
to pull tubes out. Feels that dilemma is softened today by having to insert fewer 
tubes. “Part of the problem we were dealing with is that the doctor would say, 
‘Would you like us to do everything possible for your husband?’ And what is she 
gonna say, ‘No, I want you to kill him. I never liked him anyway’? No! And 
that’s the thing we struggle with. But now we have palliative care, and we’ve 
advanced so much in that area, and you can really help the family deal with it. 
Because at what point is it okay to say, ‘Okay, let’s back off with some of the 
stuff.’” Feels that this avoids the need for extraordinary interventions that either 
don’t prolong life or do so for a quality of life that is not worth having. Example: 
a 90-year-old patient who was non-responsive and tube-fed after a surgery 
requested by very elderly wife who had Alzheimer’s disease.  
0.54.23 
On dealing with families: “It’s like a dance. You really have to feel families out, 
because you don’t know how they’re going to take it. You have to feel people out, 
because you don’t know how they’re responding to situations … There’s people 
where you’re just not ready to hear it yet.” In dementia cases, felt that families 
often “looked worse than the person”—families could be highly stressed. After 
admittance to care, patients could often be taken off their drug regimen, do 
activities, etc. But then families might sometimes mistakenly feel that patient was 
“getting better.” Interviewee feels that it’s surprising that there are still promises 
Page 6 of 8 
 
made to not put parents in nursing home—feels that people might not understand 
the demands of 24/7 care in advance, when commitments like these are made.  
0.56.00 
Interviewee’s parents relatively sooner after each other; mother’s condition 
worsened after father’s unexpected death. Interviewee found dealing with 
mother’s dementia very challenging—although physically active, she could 
“wander off—you never knew what you were getting.” Example: on one 
occasion, interviewee’s siblings were surprised when mother decided to throw 
walker away and tried to run away. Feels that in this kind of care, “you have to 
have a sense of humor.”  
0.57.53 
Around this time was the beginning of the separation of long-term care from 
psychiatric care. Alzheimer’s one kind of dementia—but there are many others, 
progressing at different rates, although many are slower. Such patients would 
previously be in long-term, but often restrained—sometimes with three different 
restraints. Feels this was done because “they didn’t know what to do with them.” 
Feels that it was an incredible advance when policy changed to remove restraints. 
Example: one patient was totally noncommunicative, and would be in a 
wheelchair all day, eyes closed. When headphones with music were placed on 
him, he would start bopping his head and reacting to the music. “And it was just 
such a—the ‘a-ha’ moment—how can we reach these people? And it was just for 
the quality of life. They’re not going to get back to being 20 years old again. But 
what can we do to make their life better?” 
0.59.54 
Felt that consistent staffing was a key component in care. One nurse had ‘cocktail 
hour’ in the afternoon, serving prune juice, to help with bowel movements (which 
interviewee feels was essential aspect of care). Again, feels that changes and 
improvements have been dramatic over years.  
1.00.34 
“And now it’s like: At what point is it okay to die? Because for some people, 
we’re doing so much at the end. Do they really want this at this point? So, it’s 
hard to say. And I don’t know the answer because I’m not God. But at some 
point, you need to let go, because you’re doing so much. And at what point, I 
don’t know.” 
1.01.01 
Currently reading a book by a physician, arguing that “things are not as bad we 
think”. Discusses not spending time trying to get IV in one sick kid but helping a 
larger number of people not get so sick. “And so, the whole thing is prevention.” 
(Related to general thoughts about more cost-effectively treating end-of-life 
patients.) 
1.02.49 
On board of Wisconsin Center for Nursing and various other organizations. 
Promotes nursing on state and national level. Involved with two different grants, 
writing and administering them. “Diversity is a huge need in nursing—in the 
world. But in healthcare, we need a more diverse healthcare professionals. We 
don’t have enough people that look like the people taking care of them … So 
that’s a huge push.” Also worked on Associate’s degree situation, encouraging 
people to go on. At one time, felt there was a big division between those with 
Associate’s and bachelor’s degree. At one time, a push to make BSN mandatory; 
felt this did not make sense, since Associate’s program was graduating half of 
nurses. One goal was to have 80% of nurses have BSN by 2020; in 2019, figure is 
57% (and some of this is accounted for by ‘Bachelor’s completion programs’. 
Page 7 of 8 
 
One difficulty is people not being able to go to school full-time, since they have 
jobs and families and so on. Interviewee felt that she was lucky to be able to go to 
school for four years, and that this is very difficult for people who need to take 
out loans. “There are a lot of people that they don’t need to get a bachelor’s 
degree … We need skilled trades. And what’s wrong with doing this work—
someone has to do this work … And so, we have students coming here who have 
credits, $60,000 in debt, and work at a Starbuck’s, wanting a bachelor’s to get 
them a job.” 
1.06.24 
Degrees only confer Associate’s or bachelor’s degree; RN designation is 
determined by passing a national exam. Determined by first attempt at exam. LPN 
is less time and training—this is a technical diploma. “But LPNs—they need them 
and then they don’t need them. Nursing’s been cruel to LPNs.” But interviewee’s 
school does not plan to have a standalone LPN program. “The whole goal is 
career pathways. Our students have to take the CNA course first. I was a CNA 
before I became a nurse—and that was a very valuable experience for me. The 
goal is to keep going and not just to stop after one degree.” Hospitals sometimes 
require a bachelor’s degree within 3-5 years, but with tuition reimbursement. 
1.08.43 
Currently around 250-300 in initial courses. So, at the very least, a three-year 
program including gen. ed. requirements. Students petition for nursing courses, 
which take two years to complete. Usually around 500 people in a pool waiting to 
get in [to nursing]. Graduate about 40 nurses a semester, due to part-time 
commitment of students. Some pressure to have students finish quicker, but 
“people have so much in their life going on.” Example: one woman had five 
children and was a single mother and wanted to take two “heavy” courses during 
the summer semester but was unable to complete both courses. 
1.11.15 
“People feel that they’re going to self-destruct if they don’t get it done … 
Sometimes we recommend that they go part-time … You graduate a semester 
later, but you’re not flunking out.” 
1.11.49 
“To me, out success stories are not the straight A students, but the ones that 
struggled and we’ve had to help along the way … people who flunked out but 
recovered and took boards on their first attempt and got a job.” 
1.12.18 
A pinning ceremony—a tradition going back to Florence Nightingale, showing 
that someone meets standards—takes place for all nursing graduates. Florence 
Nightingale backstory and its interaction with class and education dynamics.  
1.13.52 
“When I was working years ago, besides the hat, you knew by the pin people had 
what school they went to. I still have the pin from graduation … The pins are 
unique to that school … It’s a nice tradition. You don’t see them wear them on 
their scrubs. We used to wear them on our uniforms.” This changed with the 
introduction of scrubs. “Because we used to wear white. You had your hat and 
then you had your nametag, and you put your pin above your nametag. It was 
very interesting, those days.” 
1.14.54 
“I’ve seen a lot of these changes in the time I’ve been a nurse. I became a nurse at 
22, and I’m 69 now. So, I’ve been a nurse a long time, and I’ve worked the entire 
time. So, I’ve been able to do a lot of different things. And that’s what I love 
about nursing—I’ve been able to do a lot of different kinds of nursing. And so 
that’s been—if you get tired of one type of nursing, you just do something else. 
Page 8 of 8 
 
So, there’s so many different things you do, and that’s great. And then to go into 
academia. If someone had told me I’d do this when I’d graduated from college, 
I’d have told them they were nuts.”
