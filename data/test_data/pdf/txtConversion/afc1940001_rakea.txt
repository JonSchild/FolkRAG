David RiceThe Rake and Rambling BladeAlternative title: So I Robbed Old Nelse.James O'Bryant is my
name.From the old eastern shores I spedA-spending my money on ???????They called me a rake and
rambling blade.I took to me a loving wife;I loved her as I love my life ; And to support her fine and
goodWas forced to rob on the highway.I robbed old Nelse, I do declare,I robbed him on St. James's
Creek,I robbed him ? fell him down , And with my comrades divided round.My father said, "He is
of age."The best of counsel did engageAll they could do, did not set me freeNor save me from the
gallows' teeth.My sister weeps, my father mourns,My mother cries, my darling ? Pretty Polly weeps
and tears her hairJust like a lady in dispair.Oh, now I am condemned to die , And many a pretty girl
for me [may cry],But all her cries will not set me free , Nor save me from the gallows' teeth.Now I
am / dead and laid in my grave ; Three funeral sermons preached for meAnd all my [?] joyHere goes
the rake and rambling boy.
