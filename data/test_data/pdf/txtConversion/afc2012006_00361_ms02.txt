Worked for episcopal diocese of Texas for the last 30 years. Built small churches, parish 
halls, schools and an activity center. Been more fulfilling. Given an opportunity to 
mingle, know small churches.

Grandfather was from Norway, Left when he was 14. Worked as a cannon boy in a ship. 
Circled the globe for two years. Grandfather had relatives in NY. When he was done 
sailing, landed in NY and sought work there. Became a carpenter. Heard of the Panama 
canal opportunity. Worked for two years there. Grandfather was encouraged to go to US 
for naturalization process. Had to stay for 5 years. He settled in Texas for a new start. 
Started in the construction business in 1909. Took night classes at the YMCA. in 1912, 
went back to Norway and married Ingleborg. Came back raised a family. Grandfather 
started as a one man operation. Had an interest for projects on the water. Liked heavy 
construction. He built the Miller Outdoor theater. Museum of Fine Arts Built the 
chemistry building at Rice Univ.. Also picked up work at the Port. Built the second 
public dock - the Manchester dock. Hired by Anderson Clayton, big in the cotton 
business. Built a 1700 linear foot dock in 90 days. Remodeled and uncovered a sharp 
shooter, crow bar and a spade shovel. Grandfather restored them and put them in a glass 
case in his office. Through the years, Tellepsen built more docks. Petro chem group, 
construction group and commercial group. One of the last jobs was for Philips, a dock at 
the Port. Actual work on the port was always there. In 1950 Howard Tellepsen was asked 
to be the Port Chairman. Was an active civil leader in Houston. Following in his father's 
footsteps , branched out more. Born in 1913. Was 43 years old when elected as the 
chairman. Father had done a lot early on in his life. Took the reins at the port and got it 
back in shape. Was responsible for bond issue votes, was a real cheerleader for the Port 
of Houston as he realized port is vital to Houston's economy.  
 
Some port leaders and chaplains got together and gave a lease to the seafarers center in 
1969. Was told to start construction. Needed to raise money. Decided to start construction 
 
 
before the money was raised. Tellepsen built it. First service there on Christmas Eve. Big 
soccer field where ship crews would play each other. large swimming pool. In Mid 80s 
pavilion with basketball court was added. Center was highly successful.

Back then ships required more seafarers. They would stay a week to two weeks. became 
very evident that another branch needed to be opened. At Morgan’s point in Barber's cut. 
Very first set of docks there was by Tellepsen. Getting ready for the Panama Canal to 
open is another link at the other side of the port. After 9/11 restrictions are still in place 
and makes it harder for seafarers to even get off the boat. Last year chaplains went to 
5800 ships. Almost 28000 seafarers could get help from the chaplains. Help like phone 
cards, communication, wifi. First thing seafarers want to do, is go to Walmart. Port 
authority offer a lot of support.  
 
00:22:34 
The TWIC card became prominent. Staff at seafarer center have TWIC cards. Staff picks 
up seafarers who don't have TWIC cards. Shipping agent on the board. Take seafarers to 
Walmart, banking work and even the center. The original seafarer's center was a state of 
the art facility. Like a small YMCA. Ships don't need as many seafarers as they used 
before. Have three maritime lawyers on board. Lawyers help when there are certain 
situations where seafarers are not getting a fair deal. Have the seafarers interest in mind 
but now it is a more litigious society. Abel to direct them to a proper course of action.

Grandfather died in 1975, regret not asking him more stories. Never gave him the 
opportunity to tell his stories. Been involved in the downtown YMCA, named after the 
grandfather because of his activity, involvement and support at the YMCA. Had to look 
into past history of grandfather to be used on panels at the YMCA. Was very proud to be 
an American. He built his house in the East-end and his work was in the East-end. One of 
the first houses on Montrose was built by grandfather. Still standing. Just six months ago, 
uncovered an address that was built exactly 100 years ago built by grandfather. Had a 
Scandinavian look. In 1923 granddad sent his family to Norway for the summer. While 
there were away added a second floor to the house as a surprise. Going to have a time 
capsule at the YMCA. Grandparents went to Christ church downtown. Church the 
redeemer was everything for grandparents. Grandmother began prayer organizations 
throughout Houston.  Houston is still a young city. has been blessed with pioneering 
families.  
 
00:49:15 
Dad had a lot of civic responsibilities. He never brought work home. In 1954, Dad was 
president of Chamber of Commerce. Returned to the building he had helped build. Dad 
made sons work outside of school during summer break. Family has an amazing history 
of repeat work. Granddad worked at Rice, brother did Rice Wellness building.

Brother are very different from each other. Wanted to know the business from the nuts 
and bolts. Brother graduated with an engineering degree. Dad did not feel it was 
necessary either. Brother started out in the office whereas he started out in the field. 
Became a rodman - person that holds the rod while the field engineer looks through his 
level. and then became field engineer. Felt this urge to branch out. Became partners with 
sister and bought old homes in West Univ. and fixed them up and sold them. Were abel 
to make a living but those who made the money were those that bought the remodeled 
houses and sold it after a couple of years. Did not have the cash flow to do that. Went on 
to the commercial side. 
 
In the mid 80’s built the very first activity center for church. the influence from father 
and grandfather is not only build something but take pride in the work done by those who 
helped build it long after work is done.  
 
01:02:06 
The overriding pride for the Port of Houston. People that worked on the docks were on 
the waterfront. things have changed now. Professionals now don't understand the true 
meaning of what the port is for Houston.  
 
01:05:49 
Remarkable for an immigrant to come to the US without knowing the language and 
becoming such an important person the city. Was amazed at how resourceful father was. 
After he graduated was living at home, dad was responsible for concrete order. Ordered 
one truck too many. Grandfather was very had on him.  
 
01:15:27 
Was in college during the strike of 1960s. Was during Dad's final years. Left in 66 for 
college. Tellpesen was a union contractor. Heard stories from the management;s side. 
Was familiar with strike that went on in construction. Dad was successful in getting along 
with commissioners and labor, with everyone. Grandfather had a good reputation in 
Norway. Was awarded the St. Olaf's award.  
 
01:20:59 
Got to know the Norwegian consulate. Was astonished by the numbers. Some 
Norwegians come to a the annual seafarers gala. Don't know if they are spread around 
Houston or congregate in one area. Very sophisticated people in the Marine business. See 
potential of Houston. Port of NY was always first and it was competing with NEw 
Orleans. Houston was sometimes second. statistics are still being measures the same way 
in terms of tonnage.  
 
The area of the docks was extremely union. Couldn't work there unless they were union. 
Has changed since then.
