Born in Guatemala in 1964. Came to 
the U.S. at age 20.

What brought you to the U.S. 
It was vacation, kind of. I was studying 
to be an engineer and came on 
vacation. His girlfriend (now wife) had 
family in the U.S. and wanted to visit. 
He got a Mexican visa (his father 
worked at the Mexican Consulate). He 
didn’t have the credentials but came 
anyway. He was a Yankee fan.  
 
 
Went to Mexico and after a week 
decided to cross the border. They got 
caught by border patrol. They moved 
to New York.from California. Because 
he didn’t receive court notices and 
was supposed to be deported. Missed 
the birth of his first daughter. He is the 
only black mark in the family.  
5:14 
 
He loves working with the people but 
his body is giving out. He could retire 
but he doesn’t want to.  
6:51 
 
Works not only for SunRiver but also 
for Alamo Center. The food pantry 
gets food and much more. 
 
 
Before here he worked in a mental 
health facility (but it didn’t pay enough)

Job at SunRiver Health 
 Outreach coordinator, he is able to 
promote many health and other 
services. Do well for the community.

Worked as a forklift operator and then 
in construction. He came and put 
windows in the Alamo community 
center. Then continued to do other 
improvements. Then they offered to 
hire them.  
11:22 
 
It was required that he be a citizen, 
and able to drive. And be bilingual. 
12:30 
 
He tries to solve problems. He bonds 
with people.  
 
 
Even with the pandemic, they have to 
continue to work. SunRiver health and 
Alamo community center combined to 
provide more complete services.  
16:53 
What does a typical day look like? 
Outreach work. 
Come for food and might stay for other 
services. Takes calls from the clinic. 
Picks up food in the pantry. Provide 
some special food for the kids in the 
summer. Transport people to 
appointments and such. Two days of 
food pantry (although food goes out all 
week)l 
 
 
Lots of people are coming for food 
now, especially people with no jobs. 
There is a shortage of food right now. 
Visa Guys - here on work Visas so 
they come around.  
22:36 
How does your work connect to health 
care? It is all under the umbrella of 
health care.  
I have a guy right now who is alcoholic 
and about to lose his job and house. 
He is also diabetic. The other thing is 
farmworkers need vaccines and 
tetanus shots.

trouble. Now works with the foremen 
who tried to chase him away in the 
past.

taking people in the van when he 
shouldn’t.

Challenging situation. 
Right across the street is housing for 
farmers. This guy had an emergency. 
There were three guys in the house 
who called and said this guy needed 
to go to the hospital. They had no car 
that day. Carried the guy halfway up 
the road because the truck couldn’t 
make it down a muddy road. They got 
to the hospital.  
 
Training in health education and 
prevention. 
Used to work in mental health before 
he came to Alamo. The women in his 
family are in the health profession. 
Gets training all the time. He had to 
take defensive driving.

drive to the Mexican consulate. But he 
has brought the Mexican consulate to 
the Alamo 5 times. He worked a little 
on Green Light. 
31:30 
Who are migrant farm workers?  
We work with all sorts of people but 
the farm workers have some special 
benefits. He does a lot of 
transportation to Westchester. He 
takes the opportunity in the car to talk 
to people about health and such. 
Talks about prevention.  
33:26

calamine lotion, how to check for tics.

Hunting

hunt but may not understand the laws.

waiter and a bartender. Every job got 
better. Been at Alamo for 15 years

Can you talk about a family you really 
helped?  
About 5 years ago, a lady from a 
church(about 75 families in the 
church) was a single lady with two 
kids. We could give her 3 Christmas 
wishes. I wish I was living alone with 
my kids. The rent for her room was a 
wish. There was a package with boots 
and jackets and half the rent for the 
month. But in the envelope was $550 
and two $50 certificates to a grocery 
store. By the next year she had a job.

Hoping to go back to preCovid 
programming

10 people in Chester, 12 people in 
Goshen, 22 people in Middletown.

disease to the neighbors.

COVID relief. In one case, Dad died of 
COVID and the rest of the family didn’t 
have money.  
 
 
They don’t really take precautions 
while traveling and they did not test for 
COVID.

Koreans, Russians, Poles (some who 
are growers) 
 
 
There is a fungus that get under the 
nails of the onion packers.  
 
 
Worry about getting involved or not 
getting involved in worker 
compensation. Or when a worker 
leaves a rental in disrepair.  
1:21:45 
Do the Visa guys come back to the 
same farm every year?  
Yes and the migrant farm workers who 
have a circuit around the country 
Come back to work by contract at the 
same farm.  
1:22:30

one country or another? 
Yes to reduce cultural clash. About 55 
farms in the area. Close to 1200 farm 
workers in this area alone, pre COVD. 
About ½ locals and ½ migrant.
