Pat Francois: 
How did you become a domestic worker? 
Liseth: 
That's a long story, because as a teenager, [00:02:00] I came because I'm a 
Catholic, so I have an aunt that is a nun, but I will tell you a little story. I don't 
want to go ... It's a long story. I come with a family from we are six, but 
unfortunately the number six, my brother, at the age a month they have to 
remove an eye. Background you don't have any help. 
Pat Francois: 
Okay. 
Liseth: 
Doctor, whatever you have, only you worked for it. You have [00:02:30] to have 
the money. If you don't have the money, you don't get any medical treatment. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Liseth: 
My brother need to a lot attention, especially it wasn't the attention with my 
parents were care about it, because where we grew up you take care of the ... 
Oldest take care of the youngest, so that wasn't a problem, but I still notice they 
still worry about. Like my mother, [00:03:00] when we used to go to bed at two 
in the morning, three in the morning. She got a job with designer to sewing 
clothing. Some of the samples, they were samples. I learned to sew how and I 
saw my father never have a day off from the [inaudible 00:03:18]. He was 
working a [stairway 00:03:28] 360 days a year. Never a day off, but he wanted 
us to always have that food, we go to school, [00:03:30] like us girls. I remember 
my father always said to my mother, "Teach the girls never beg anyone for 
anything. I don't want my girls never to beg for love or food." Grow with dignity 
and respect. 
 
When I was teenager I had the opportunity, because my aunt is a nun, because 
my mother side, they're Europeans, from Spain. She had [00:04:00] some cousin 
that were nun in New York City, so that's how I came, and I came to the first 
time I got to the United States, I went to a church that's between Little Italy and 
Chinatown. In the fifth floor, they were renting rooms to single girls that used to 
come out of the country or they were around but singles, from ... They said 
teenagers to 20 years, but as long as you pay rent it was okay. The first time 
[00:04:30] I got there, I went help to change the flowers, the vases for the 
person who was charge in the church, so I met a Guatemalan woman there. 
 
I start to talk and I say, "Oh, I'm here with this," and she said, "Are you planning 
to stay working?" I said, "I don't know. I will look. If I see how the money is 
here." I remember she said, "Well, you want to do here, I'm a nanny 
housekeeper, live-in job." She told me, "I work with a Jewish for 10 years 
[00:05:00] in East 8th in Kings Highway, Brooklyn." She said, "I used to work in 
that market, you're going to start working $200 for six days, but live-in job. Most 
of them they have six children plus two, but you have to do everything 
depends." I said, "I should try. Let me know you have something," so three 
weeks later she saw me in the church and she says, "Are you interested 
Domestic Workers United

[inaudible 00:05:27]?" I said, "Yes." Then [00:05:30] she said, "You will love 
children?" "Yes, I do. I can clean, I can do everything. Any kind I will do." You 
have to do what ... I need the money so that's how I start in the market. 
Pat Francois: 
As a domestic worker.  
Liseth: 
I started working six days. I remember when I went in interview, it was her boss 
sister, so because she introduce me to her. She said, "Yes." She didn't ask me a 
question. She said, "You know Rosa?" "Yes, I know through the church," the 
same way she [00:06:00] told her. She just look my hands, she look my face. I 
was a teenager, and I was a good-looking, strong. Not like now, so that's what ... 
Then she gave me the job, and I started working for her six days, 180 days for six 
days. To get in the morning six thirty, seven, Monday, and get out Sunday 
around ten. Nine, ten. Yeah, because they have an alarm and they put alarm at 
night, and we have to wait until they ... [00:06:30] They use Shabbat, so inside 
they didn't allow to touch electricity and anything. That's how I start in the 
market, and that's how I keep going. 
Pat Francois: 
How long have you done this work? 
Liseth: 
This work? 
Pat Francois: 
Yeah. 
Liseth: 
The first job I did only for ... I didn't last. Maybe seven months, because I said to 
myself I'm doing here $180. I started knowing people, saying, "You can do 
more." I said, "I was looking for $200," so I started working Sunday [00:07:00] 
for housekeeping. She was giving me ... There was a teacher, the Jewish, and 
she used to give me $40 for eight hours, but she was a nice, and the husband 
was teaching me English. 
Pat Francois: 
Hold on, did you say $40? 
Liseth: 
For eight hours. $40 for eight hours, but I was so happy, I'm telling you. I was so 
excited. 
Pat Francois: 
[00:07:30] What year was it? 
Liseth: 
It was 1994. I was so happy. 
Pat Francois: 
That made you happy? 
Liseth: 
I'm telling you, I was so happy, because- 
Pat Francois: 
Without knowing you was being exploited?

Liseth: 
I know, but I am telling you, when I was doing $180 I was waking ... They were 
Shabbat, Jewish and religious. On Friday they do celebrate the dinner. 
Pat Francois: 
Shabbat. 
Liseth: 
Yes, Shabbat. The dinner, so in Mrs Jill house, she still living [00:08:00] East 8th, 
Kings Highway. Sometimes I pass by their house and remember that. Just 
walking, and they're still there. Mrs Jill used to invite her mother, her sister, so 
there was a big dinner. I remember the time it was longer than that, and the 
first time I saw the dinner I got shocked, because the father tried 12 dishes 
different. Say how he can eat like a horse, how that fits in the tummy. Too much 
food. The first time I saw a human eat that [00:08:30] much, I never see before. 
I'm telling you, I was so happy, so in this job because they were Shabbat. 
Pat Francois: 
They work you hard. 
Liseth: 
For I, we used to stay until Saturday until one in the morning. Sometimes two, 
because all the dishes are not easy washing. 
Pat Francois: 
Especially if they have friends over. 
Liseth: 
Every silver is special, that you have to do hand-wash, but her mother, her sister 
used to bring her worker, her housekeepers and her nannies, so we do a team. 
[00:09:00] One were washing, we have another drying, and the other one was 
putting pile, because the same day, Saturday, we had to be at six thirty, seven 
up, because they used to go to church Saturday morning too. I'm telling you, I 
was so happy. Mr David, the husband, I remember every ... Sometime he used 
to do Monday or Friday morning, he used to go open the door of the fridge, to 
make sure there was enough food. They never deny food to me. 
 
[00:09:30] It's long hours, but I was happy. I don't have nothing to say about 
them. I learnt to eat the pita, their bread. Pita with cheese. They used to leave 
for us. Put the cheese on and put in the microwave, melt it like [inaudible 
00:09:46] I learnt to eat that, all their food, and I love their food. I don't 
complain about it. They were exploiting me, I was so happy, so excited. Getting 
money. 
Pat Francois: 
Question to you. If what you had [00:10:00] known then what you know now, 
would you have worked for how much hours? 10 hours? 
Liseth: 
The part-time I do housekeeper there were eight hours for $40, and- 
Pat Francois: 
Would you have worked- 
Liseth: 
Let me finish. The living-in job they were seven to nine, nine thirty depend the 
children, because there was two boys and two girls, and the little one [00:10:30] 
was five months.

Pat Francois: 
How many days? 
Liseth: 
Six days. 
Pat Francois: 
What salary that was like? 
Liseth: 
$180 for six days. 
Pat Francois: 
$100- 
Liseth: 
$80 for six days. 
Pat Francois: 
For six days? 
Liseth: 
Yeah. 
Pat Francois: 
My question to you is if you had known then what you know now, would you 
have worked for $180 for six days? 
Liseth: 
I know it's a tough question [00:11:00] and tough answers, but I needed. I didn't 
know anyone, so I was pleased she opened the door to me. It give me the job 
and the money. I was able to stay here and pay my rent in the church, because 
the church I had to pay my rent. They never let me stay free. If I wouldn't pay 
rent they would be kicking me out, and I was by myself. I was educated very 
good, not getting [inaudible 00:11:26] thing. Some people don't understand, 
[00:11:30] but I was pleased with them. I was appreciate they opened the door 
to me without knowing me, and they give me a job. That's how I learn a lot of 
things, that's who I am now. How I start in the market. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. That was tough. 
Liseth: 
I was happy. Teenager, tough teenager. 
Pat Francois: 
How long you have done this work? 
Liseth: 
Excuse me? 
Pat Francois: 
How many years you've been doing this work? 
Liseth: 
This work, it's going to be almost 20. 
Pat Francois: 
A long time. 
Liseth: 
[00:12:00] Yeah. 
Pat Francois: 
How many positions you have had in this work industry? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Liseth: 
Only three jobs. Three jobs in the 20 years. 
Pat Francois: 
All the three jobs were babysitting? 
Liseth: 
In all these years. 
Pat Francois: 
All three jobs were baby- 
Liseth: 
Yeah, full-time, but I've been doing extra weekends housekeeper or elderly 
caregiver. Extra babysitter for people who need, my friends [00:12:30] replacing 
me, but full-time job only three positions. 
Speaker 3: 
I'm sorry, is that common through ... You worked for 20 years. That's- 
Liseth: 
Yeah, the person, the one I work eight years, the twins that I left recently, I 
started taking care of their teens since they were born until 10 years and a half, 
almost 11. Now I'm with the same family. I didn't ask, but it's a relative. The boy 
is going to be three. 
Speaker 3: 
[00:13:00] That's interesting. That's a long period. 
Pat Francois: 
She was a fortunate one to have jobs that last that length of time. 
Liseth: 
I've been patient. Doing a lot of things, like getting here I get all like this. I've 
been focused only in my job. Never like, "I love you." That doesn't work for me. 
That's baloney, you know why? I remember the first time someone tell me, "I 
love you. You're part of the family." She [00:13:30] said, "Can you come to work 
free Saturday?" I was always say in the market, how I've been keeping good is 
they only know I'm Liseth. They don't know if I have father, sister, cousin, 
whatever. I always keep my distance and I always never have relationship with 
them. Just good morning, good afternoon. The boy did, the child this. Only with 
the job, nothing my private life, and I've been having issues with that, because 
someone was ... 
 
Like on my recent job. [00:14:00] When the guy knew I ... This beginning of 
[inaudible 00:14:03] and one day I need to be at school at six, because the day 
of the test. I can't be late, so the woman asked me to stay. I explained to her, so 
when the woman told the man that I'm studying he said, "Who give permission 
to her to study?" He didn't tell me directly, because when I spoke the woman I 
told [00:14:30] her, "You hiring me from seven thirty to eight in the morning to 
five. I make my own plans, but you hire me until five and every day I have a 
problem to leave at five, or every day I live five fifteen, five twenty, and I need 
sometimes to leave on time. My hired time." 
Pat Francois: 
[00:15:00] What I'd like to hear is walk me through a typical day routine, what 
are yours day-to-day responsibilities? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Liseth: 
As a nanny? 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Liseth: 
When they hire me the woman needs to hire worker woman. I depend from her 
and she depends from me. She has high position and she needs to be in her job, 
so my [00:15:30] job description isn't, because I started working when the boy 
was, full-time, two months. No, he wasn't two months. Yeah, around the time. It 
was cook for the child, feed the child, bathe the child, do the boy’s laundry. If he 
needs some iron, the boy clothing. Clean around his area, keep every neat. 
Everything that this belong to a child. "If something [00:16:00] happen to a child 
immediately take picture, and send it to me. Whatever it is happen to a child let 
me know. I want everything about him, good, bad things, and follow rules." I 
have to feed them what they say. Everything that ... They have a menu. Go to 
places where they said. The classes, everything to inform on. That's my position, 
yes. 
Pat Francois: 
As you stated, your responsibilities. 
Liseth: 
Yeah, that's my responsibilities. 
Pat Francois: 
[00:16:30] What skills do you need to become a domestic worker? 
Liseth: 
What skills do I need? 
Pat Francois: 
To become a domestic worker? 
Liseth: 
I need to be mean. To be less appreciated. I find it, because easy that way. More 
tough. I have the feeling that I'm not tough person. I'm tough, I'm serious. I'm 
honest, but I know its people [00:17:00] where I've been they don't ... I'm sure 
they know, but they don't ... As a domestic worker, they don't want to use what 
it is courtesy. I will give you simple. One time since I was hired, was the child 
needs to go the doctor’s appointment. If I need to get there at six thirty in the 
morning I have to be there, okay? One time the man ask me, "Can you come 
tomorrow at the latest seven ten, seven something, all right?" 
 
I said, [00:17:30] "Fine," because I thought it was for the child. When I got there 
it was because he had to go move his car, so when I knew it is his car I said, 
"Excuse me sir. Next time, I did this time, but next time I won't do it, because I 
have to leave my house five thirty in the morning, because I don't live across the 
street, and without pay the extra hours." That things. 
Pat Francois: 
What training is necessary to be a successful [00:18:00] domestic worker? 
Liseth: 
We need little of everything, you know? Little of everything. The more 
important thing I'm telling my friend. Don't trust that, "I love you. You're part of 
the family," because this is only from the [inaudible 00:18:15] because I have 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
7
some experience. They don't know courtesy, because courtesy they come and 
they go ... That's when you got issues and you have to leave the job. I was trying 
my this, and so as a domestic [00:18:30] worker we need to know a little 
everything, and unfortunately in the market as a nanny, one of the job 
description you're supposed not to do anything, but for the child. I don't mind 
to do his cleaning, but only the child. Not the adults, so I think that make the 
family more comfortable, and if all the house the nannies we have those rules, 
we're going to get more jobs. [00:19:00] If I have my child, I want that they grow 
up in the clean, not in the dirt. 
Pat Francois: 
When caring for a child, what are some ways you help him fall asleep?  
Liseth: 
Children that I've been, they've been very ... It depends. It depends the age, 
depend the situation, depends how we training. That's how the children goes to 
bed. Like [00:19:30] example, the children that I've been for the nap time, the 
one that are now, he never naps. I was already fall asleep and not him. He never 
naps, but the ones I've been before, I used to sing a song or sing a little book 
first, and lay down on the bed and they got so used to see me, that I have to lay 
down on the floor and they just go speak if I were there. They just go and then 
finally fall asleep in half an hour. They just were afraid to be by themselves. 
[00:20:00] That's what I've been doing, but all children are different, you know? 
Pat Francois: 
What training is necessary to be a successful domestic worker? 
Liseth: 
Which training? 
Pat Francois: 
Yeah. 
Liseth: 
Probably, I've been thinking about it. 
Pat Francois: 
[00:20:30] What training, what will suit you more in your workplace? 
Liseth: 
To learning things, something like that? 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. What would make you more professional in your workplace? 
Liseth: 
That, in my experience we can be- 
Pat Francois: 
With given kids. 
Liseth: 
With the kids? 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. What will help you make it better for you in your job? 
Liseth: 
Example, if we know how to help them in homework, [00:21:00] if the parents 
are not there, but of course this thing always have to in the beginning discuss 
with the parents. All the kind of things, like help them in more the activities. Like 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

my child jump on my shoulders, be more flexible on certain things, but this 
depends the child you have, the parents you work for, and depends the child's 
condition too, because everything depends. 
Pat Francois: 
Okay. Is there [00:21:30] some specialty or expertise that you have? 
Liseth: 
Like what? 
Speaker 3: 
Is there something that you feel like you do that's- 
Pat Francois: 
You specialize in. Something that you do the best, and whatever you do people 
like it a lot. All right, for instance. Example, let's see. Some people make some 
very good cookies, some people bake some [00:22:00] very good bread, so 
something that you're really good at that make it easy for you. 
Liseth: 
I think that I don't have that specific choice, but in the job whenever I ... As I told 
you, I do other things for the child that they're okay for. I never- 
Pat Francois: 
Do you personally- 
Liseth: 
In my personality? 
Pat Francois: 
Yeah, you individually. 
Liseth: 
In my individually? 
Pat Francois: 
Yeah. 
Liseth: 
[00:22:30] I like to do a lot of things, but- 
Pat Francois: 
What specialty? Something special you like to do, or cook, or make, or sow. 
Liseth: 
My specialty is skin care esthetician, so skin care. 
Pat Francois: 
Skin care? 
Liseth: 
I love to do massage, to clean. To clean those with pimples, to put the mask, the 
steamer, use the high frequency. All the kind of things I love to do people to. 
When the people wake up and see their face in the mirror shiny, clean, to feel 
something they [00:23:00] feel inside. I love to see that, to do that. 
Pat Francois: 
You are an expert in that field? 
Liseth: 
Skin care, yeah. I'm an esthetician. 
Pat Francois: 
Okay, you deal with the skin? 
Domestic Workers United

Liseth: 
Yeah. 
Pat Francois: 
That is alongside with your domestic work? 
Liseth: 
I use only for my friends. Like the weekends, if someone needs a facial. 
Pat Francois: 
You specialize in that, you're good at that? 
Liseth: 
That what they say, I don't know. Either way- 
Pat Francois: 
You have to know what you're [00:23:30] good at too. Sell yourself, so what 
you're good at. 
Liseth: 
I do a lot of things. I do a lot of things that are- 
Pat Francois: 
Something that you're very good at, and it would sell you, sell your stuff, sell 
your product, whatever you're good at. Like that, and when caring for a child, 
what are some ways you help them fall [00:24:00] asleep? 
Liseth: 
That's what I told you, it depends the child, and I depend the situation where 
you are, because I give you example. When I work with the child overtime after 
work, and after I feed them, give them a bath, read a book, and I brush their 
teeth. If they're out of the diapers, go to the [inaudible 00:24:24] or give the last 
part of them the diaper. Read a book, and I said to [00:24:30] them if they have 
the last bath before going to bed. Give you half an hour before, to go and bathe, 
and I explain to them it's time to go bathe. After I read the book I say tell me the 
children, where I've been. 
 
I lay down next to them and they're fine, so it depends the child. How they are 
and how they've been. That depends the child, but the only thing that I notice in 
children is that some people expecting they [00:25:00] fall asleep, and they go ... 
I have that thing meet in my mind that you got, instead you make him fall 
asleep, you wake him up, so I keep them in a quiet room. No light, and be shh! 
That's my rules when I'm with child. 
Pat Francois: 
What are some ways you get a child to eat? 
Liseth: 
That's hard part, but [00:25:30] I always focus on the child's favorite. Like my 
child, he likes barbecue sauce, so for make to eat the chicken breast I dip the 
chicken breast in the barbecue sauce, and he ate it. I focus on the child's 
favorite thing that add it to the food, and they eat it like this. 
Pat Francois: 
What are some ways you get a child to stop [00:26:00] crying or fussing? 
Liseth: 
I try ... I know my children, their favorite things, and I say like in the summer, my 
child likes strawberry ice cream. "You stop crying I give you strawberry ice 
cream, and we're going to go ... " Depends how the situation they're crying. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
10
Pat Francois: 
You always give them a little reward. 
Liseth: 
It's not a reward, but it [00:26:30] depends the reason of crying. If he's crying 
for something that he's not supposed to get it, I say, "Sorry. You're not getting if 
you crying, but when you stop crying let me know, and we're going to do 
something else, or we can play something else." Depends the situation of the 
child. 
Pat Francois: 
Okay. What are some ways you get a child to stop crying and fussing? 
Speaker 3: 
I think we just asked that. 
Liseth: 
It's the same one. 
Pat Francois: 
It's [00:27:00] the same question? 
Liseth: 
Yeah. 
Pat Francois: 
All right. Have you ever used homeopathic remedies or folk remedies to help 
care child who is sick? 
Liseth: 
Yeah, the child that I work, I mean in 1997 to 2008. He was little. He used 
[00:27:30] to be ... He was like to see only the mommy. It's funny, when the 
mommy when was around he was- 
Pat Francois: 
Fussy. 
Liseth: 
Yeah. She was saying, "He have sugar," and he never have sugar because he was 
with me, so he knew the mother will say, "It's the sugar," so he was stopped 
doing that. He used to use homeopathic pills to put under the tongue to make 
him calm down, but that's something ... Children are very smart. They know 
how to behave with you, so that was issue. Mommy and my son [00:28:00] 
thing. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. Is there any special skills you might have taught your employer? 
Liseth: 
No. Nothing, as I told you, when they hired me they just wanted they see me to 
cook, clean, to take of their child. That's what they be asking me. 
Pat Francois: 
What was the best part of the job? Please give an example. 
Liseth: 
My best part [00:28:30] of the job was in my job when I was with the twins, 
because they were twins and when one start to cry, you know? I remember I 
had one here with the bottle and the other and the other in my foot, was like 
this, and I joined them. I had some fun with them. 
Pat Francois: 
What is the worst part of your job? Please give an example.

Liseth: 
My worst part of my job is [00:29:00] when you are with the ... Let's say if I'm 
feeding the children, and the parents get distracted, making them ... They're 
eating okay, and they go aah. When the child getting hyper, they disappear like 
this. Like example, when my children are ready to go to bed, the parent used to 
go ten o'clock turn on the lights, say aah, and walk in. I say, "Please, shh! They're 
going to [00:29:30] sleep," because they have the mentality that you do noise 
the children going to sleep, and I have the mentality that you put children bed. 
Has to be quiet, dark and smooth, you know? 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Liseth: 
That's what I ... That really make me angry from them, because you've been 
working hard to make the child, and they go ... 
Pat Francois: 
Yes, when you want the child to settle down. 
Liseth: 
Yeah. 
Pat Francois: 
How is your relationship with your current boss? 
Liseth: 
[00:30:00] Very strict. Only, "Good morning, good afternoon." She got me things 
that she wrote for me, and I wrote for her what we needed. I send a picture 
from we are. That's all, very strict. From, "Good morning, how are you?" Just- 
Pat Francois: 
Formal. 
Liseth: 
Formal. Only from the child, nothing from me. Very strict. 
Pat Francois: 
Will she ask you how you doing? 
Liseth: 
No, they never ask me. Just, "Good morning, how are you?" That's [00:30:30] 
all. 
Pat Francois: 
She doesn't care about the person who taking care of her precious gem? 
Liseth: 
I love that and I don't care, because I really don't want they ask me question 
about my life, because a lot of things to do with the children. 
Pat Francois: 
No, not to get into your personal life, but simply, "How are you doing today?" 
Liseth: 
Just, "Good morning." 
Pat Francois: 
"How do you feel today?" If I- 
Liseth: 
The woman, I don't see her. She's a hard worker. When I get there, once in a 
while she's there, and then she's ready to leave at seven fifty. The [00:31:00] 
man sometime is there, and he just say, "Good morning," and that's good 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
12
morning to me because I don't want to ... When she hire me, the first interview 
we talked on everything is going to be in the job just between her and me, so it's 
fine for me. It's fine for me. 
Speaker 3: 
Not the husband. 
Liseth: 
Not the husband, no. 
Speaker 3: 
I see, so it's just ... 
Liseth: 
Yeah, between her and I, because she said she don't want to have confuse. Like, 
"He said, I [00:31:30] said." It's only her, but when he's around and he says 
things like commenting, "Do you see?" My two jobs has been like that. 
Pat Francois: 
Are there relationship with previous children you have cared for, that are 
particularly memorable in a good or bad kind of way? 
Liseth: 
The one I am now, or the one I left? 
Pat Francois: 
[00:32:00] Previous children that you take care of. Do you still have a 
relationship? Like your former boss, like the last job you had. Not this current 
job. 
Liseth: 
Yeah, the twins, I'm still working for the twins once in a while, and I have a 
wonderful relationship with the twins. They still, when we do [inaudible 
00:32:27] they go see the show. You will see them. 
Pat Francois: 
Okay, you invite them to the- 
Liseth: 
Yeah, [00:32:30] invite them and they always ... Sometimes, "Are we going to 
the movie to have lunch together, dinners together?" I have wonderful 
memories from the children, they were so great. Even with the twins. 
Sometimes I feel like I'm taking care of only one, and I got double tired from one 
from the two, so I always remember them. Say, "How come I'm so tired? It's 
only one, and with Olivia and Winston I was okay." Maybe if I was younger. I 
don't know. 
Pat Francois: 
Double energy. 
Liseth: 
I enjoy them. I have wonderful memory from my children, [00:33:00] all of 
them. I don't have issues with them. 
Speaker 3: 
Can I just ask you a question? What was that like, taking care of the twins? 
Liseth: 
Like? 
Speaker 3: 
What was it like taking care of twins? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
13
Liseth: 
It's funny because I was enjoy it, and when they grow it's more, because when 
you're at the park you have to be like this. As a nanny it's very important you to 
be with them since they start growing, so you teach them to be next to you. Not 
to go [00:33:30] disappear. I never have problem with them. I used to go with 
them everywhere, and they still ... I miss them a lot and they got used to me 
too, and I got used to them. That's why we're still keeping in touch. Wonderful 
children, they always respect me wherever they see me. Just have a great 
relationship with them. Not with the parents, but with them. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. Do you feel that the amount [00:34:00] of hours you work and your 
holidays [inaudible 00:34:04] being respected? 
Liseth: 
Yeah, all the time. 
Pat Francois: 
It is? 
Liseth: 
Yeah, it is. 
Pat Francois: 
You get public holidays off? 
Liseth: 
Sometimes, not all the time. 
Pat Francois: 
If you do, do you get pay for them? 
Liseth: 
No, I don't get paid. Oh, yeah, I do get paid. If I get in I get paid, but if they need 
me I don't pay overpay. 
Pat Francois: 
[00:34:30] Okay. Yes, would you say that you or any worker that you know, has 
been exploited due to immigration status? 
Liseth: 
Yes. 
Pat Francois: 
Could you give an example? 
Liseth: 
I have a friend that she was working with a woman, [00:35:00] and the woman 
make her believe like she should be please because, "You don't have 
documents, and you are here. We're not supposed to give work to the ... " 
They're called [illegrants 00:35:14], and my friend told me that ... I told my 
friend, because I've been in Domestic Workers United to know now all the laws 
and everything from lawyers. I told her, "Ask her if you provide [00:35:30] one 
she's going to pay? Her security taxes, benefits," and she only asked for the 
Green Card. "Do you have Green Card?" I told her, "Ask her why she want Green 
Card?" Green Card doesn't ... Nothing to do with social security, taxes. She 
didn't even pay taxes during her overtime. Even the first family, so people using 
just as excuse to abuse. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Pat Francois: 
Yes. Do you ever share cultural things [00:36:00] from your heritage with the 
families you assist? For example, food, languages, art, folk tales or beliefs about 
life and death? 
Liseth: 
Yes, I do, because the families, the first one, the $180, all of them were kosher, 
so I got used to eat. You were not allowed to bring any food from outside, so I 
know [00:36:30] kosher, and the second one where I work is eight, almost nine 
years. She was a Jewish but not religious, but when she have her [inaudible 
00:36:44] it was kosher, and some members have with kosher, so you're not 
allowed to bring food from outside, so you eat what they ... 
Pat Francois: 
Eat. 
Liseth: 
I got leftovers, but I always being picky. I bring my own, because ... 
Pat Francois: 
Interesting. 
Speaker 3: 
What about your [00:37:00] culture? Do you ever talk about cultural things in 
Guatemala? 
Liseth: 
That's what I tell my friends. They're not interest in anything about you. They 
just interest in you give a good job. Do whatever, as much you do, they better. 
Let's say, I use example. If they have to go outside after my schedule and I have 
[00:37:30] to be overtime, if the children wake up something, next time they're 
so pleased, so happy. That's how they are, so they're really interesting only the 
job things. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. Exciting, isn't it? How do you manage balancing your personal life, family 
life, and your work life? 
Liseth: 
This is a very [00:38:00] hard thing, because I've been having hard moments for 
my family. Like the kind of things and are being happening in the moment that 
I've been working, and the time that you don't pick up the phone. When you get 
out work you hear the message that you have to do something for them. The 
day when we did poetry, that day when my- oops. 
Speaker 3: 
It's all [00:38:30] right. It's pretty indestructible. 
Pat Francois: 
You hear me? 
Speaker 3: 
Yeah. 
Pat Francois: 
All right. Sorry. 
Liseth: 
My brother, my youngest brother pass away 2011, and I was going to work but 
in the train, it's two hours, difference of background from here. Let's say over 
there it's twelve, here it's two o'clock. They call me, and I was in [00:39:00] the 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
15
train so I couldn't get the call, so when I get off the train I turn on my phone as 
usually. I hear the message that my brother passed away, and I have to be at 
work. I was ready to get into the building and the signal fail, and I have to be 
there, so it's very tough situation. It's very hard, because these people don't 
understand. 
Pat Francois: 
They think you don't have a life. 
Liseth: 
It's not that they're not ... [00:39:30] They don't have that kind of humanity that 
we born or we grew up. The respect for elders, respect for older. In background, 
you respect elder. You never see someone hitting or pushing elderly. You held 
them, right? 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Liseth: 
They don't have that kind of humanity. They will do for the cat, for the dog, but 
not for us. That's the reality. 
Pat Francois: 
Right. 
Liseth: 
That's why that I ... [00:40:00] What happened with me is because I've been 
doing nanny, housekeeper, elderly care. When I've been doing housekeeper I be 
hear what they say about the nanny, right? Bad things. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Liseth: 
When I've been doing nanny and I go somewhere, I be here what bad thing they 
say about the housekeeper, so my ears are educated. When I've been doing 
elderly care, I be hear what the family say about the nannies, about the 
housekeeper. They're like, "They're not busy, they want to be this." I've been 
educating my ears. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. [00:40:30] Are you a member of other organizations or group? 
Liseth: 
I'm so please, I be happy to be a part of Domestic Workers United, DWU, and 
[inaudible 00:40:49] I try to participate and I have a conversation whenever my 
free time, but I'm DWU. 
Pat Francois: 
Officially, you are [00:41:00] DWU. 
Liseth: 
I'm a Domestic Workers United. 
Pat Francois: 
If you have time and you're being asked to volunteer at a different organization 
you will? 
Liseth: 
Yeah, I will go to [inaudible 00:41:12] if I have a change. I like to the movement. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Pat Francois: 
When you are doing domestic work, do you feel part of a larger group or 
community? 
Liseth: 
[00:41:30] When I'm in the group, like let's say Domestic Work or [inaudible 
00:41:35] it's funny, because I feel ... I being since a teenager without my family, 
I like to be with them. I feel like a part of the family. I feel if I was with my boss I 
feel like go far, with this group I feel warm. I like to be there. I feel comfortable. 
Pat Francois: 
[00:42:00] Right. You feel secure. 
Liseth: 
I feel comfortable. I can laugh, I can move. It's comfortable, I feel that way. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. Glad to hear that. When and why did you become a part of Domestic 
Workers United, and how did you hear about it? 
Liseth: 
The first time I hear about Domestic Workers United, because I was working in 
Long Island. Sorry, my voice got coarse. In 2005 there was an [00:42:30] Asian 
woman who escaped that was a slave in Long Island, so I was in Old Brookville, 
Long Island, so it was around there. Not close but not far, so that's how I knew. 
Before I remember that, because I was doing live-in job. I came with my boss 
one weekend, and I remember I met someone were talking about, but because I 
was living-in I remember I told the person, "I can't belong because I'm coming 
only Sundays, I'm not off [00:43:00] during the week." When I left the job and I 
moved to the twins, that's when I looked for DW. I knew on the news and AM 
newspaper. They used to giving free for them. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes, right. 
Speaker 3: 
What is the story? You guys just sound like you know about it. What is the story 
about the woman that was- 
Liseth: 
There was a woman in Long Island that the people bring from their country, 
Asia, and they have a slave. One day she escape and the gas [00:43:30] station, 
they call for the police and she was without shoes, and she was extremely 
abused. There was two of them. Remember? 
Pat Francois: 
You talking about the Indonesian woman? 
Liseth: 
Yeah, Indonesian. 
Pat Francois: 
That was Islip? 
Liseth: 
Yeah, that one. 
Pat Francois: 
Domestic Workers United, when they were having a trial. 
Liseth: 
That one. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
17
Pat Francois: 
Domestic Workers- 
Liseth: 
2005 was that year. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Liseth: 
They escaped. 
Pat Francois: 
A group of domestic workers, myself included, we all went up to Long Island 
Islip when they were having a trial, to support these [00:44:00] two Indonesian 
women. The female employer, she got 10 years imprisonment, and the husband 
he got five years imprisonment. The two women were set freed, and most likely 
I believe they went back to Indonesia. 
Speaker 3: 
My gosh. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. That's the story you're talking about? 
Liseth: 
Yeah. She was naked, without shoes. Anything on, and I don't know if she could 
escape. 
Pat Francois: 
They treat these people worse [00:44:30] than animals, because as Liseth 
mentioned earlier, they take their dogs to the dentist, they take their dogs to 
the beauty parlor, the doggy parlor. They take their dogs to ... They have doggy 
summer camp, because when they go out on vacation they take their doggies 
to- 
Liseth: 
Yeah, and they pay more than 20 an hour. 
Pat Francois: 
They take their doggies to doggy school, doggy camp. If they have a bird they 
take it to bird camp. Yes they do. 
Speaker 3: 
I'm just going [00:45:00] to ... Actually, because we've been doing this for a 
while. Is Long Island ... If you would rate the best and worst places for domestic 
workers, is Long Island one of the worst? 
Pat Francois: 
Long Island is one. 
Speaker 3: 
I feel like- 
Liseth: 
Brooklyn and Long Island. 
Speaker 3: 
Really? 
Liseth: 
Yeah. 
Pat Francois: 
Followed by New Jersey. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
18
Liseth: 
It's like a market, and those people, they have [00:45:30] houses from millions, 
but they don't have the worker. It's a hard work, live-in job, and they go 
everyday out for dinner, and they're going to pay $50 for a glass of wine. Some 
of them, I have a good boss that she was paying me transportation. The eight 
years that I work for her, I never spent any penny on transportation, but her 
friends. I remember she used to tell her friend on the weekend, on Friday night. 
[00:46:00] "Today please just drink five glasses of wine and save $50 for giving 
to your nanny, so she can take a cab in the morning so you don't have to wake 
up drunk in the morning. To drop her to Hicksville Station. Yeah, it's true. 
Speaker 3: 
That's crazy. Sorry to interrupt. I just- 
Liseth: 
No, it's fine, and Brooklyn is the worst too. Brooklyn. 
Speaker 3: 
Is it really? 
Liseth: 
It is, yeah. Recently I went to consulate of Guatemala, so I met two women from 
indigenous, [00:46:30] and then she told me that her sister and her cousin were 
fired because they don't speak very well Spanish, and they were fired because 
they don't speak Spanish. I say, "I understood they were fired because of no 
English, because we are in the United States." They were fired because they 
don't speak perfect Spanish. 
Speaker 3: 
Crazy. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes, so what has it meant for you [00:47:00] and your work, that domestic 
workers bill of rights has passed in 2010? 
Liseth: 
It's very hard and tough answer, but we're going to be honest. That if we help in 
one wait and another wait, it won't. The way we help in the law is like now you 
can go to department of labor and they will listen your complain. If you are 
document, undocumented, [00:47:30] speak English or not speak English. You 
are human, but this person. That's why they [inaudible 00:47:36] they open a lot 
of day-cares, the one I mentioned to you. 
Pat Francois: 
Day-cares? 
Liseth: 
Yeah, so they say, "They do the law, now we don't need them." Why? They can't 
abuse as much as they used to. They don't like, "Why we have to pay 
overtime?" 44 hours over the 40 hours. It's funny, because they have [00:48:00] 
the idea ... I have the issue like I was in a family one time for a friend, and the 
woman says, "The bible said you are a slave." I said, "I'm sorry, but the bible 
didn't say you say you're a slave." These kind of people that we have to please 
to them, because we are here in the United States. I always say the bill of rights 
really is going to work if finally God give amnesty. If [00:48:30] they ask for, 
"Give me Green Card." I will give you my work permit or my social security for 
my benefits, because even if they know we can provide the IRS number, like my 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
19
friend said. "I have the IRS number that you would like to pay my taxes." The 
woman goes like, you know? 
Pat Francois: 
I know. 
Liseth: 
That really will help the bill of rights, because [00:49:00] now they say, "They 
don't have paper, so I will give you job." That's how the exploitation grew up, 
because I explain to people. As undocumented, you don't get a penny for the 
government. I don't know how people say that undocumented people get help. 
You don't get any help. You have to do whatever it is for $5. Do job, because you 
have to pay rent. Your bills. No one's having you free, so that's what some 
people don't understand. That made the industry [00:49:30] to more grew up in 
small exploitation. Probably the amnesty come up, so this thing really is going to 
work. That's what I've been seeing outside from people. 
Pat Francois: 
What would you like to see happen in the future with the bill of rights? 
Liseth: 
The first thing, I always pray to God [inaudible 00:49:50] because as a worker, as 
humans we coming on this country for a reason. Like me, we're [00:50:00] not a 
criminals. I decided to stay in this country to help my parents, for better life to 
my brother who lose an eye when he was two months. Every year they have to 
buy a glass eye for him, and they eye glass in background was too expensive. 
We have a reason here, we're not criminals. I know as a human all the world has 
good and bad, but workers, [00:50:30] we should serve. Everybody has the 
documents and let's make a living, so the improvement that the exploitation. 
Pat Francois: 
From your perspective, why is Domestic Workers United so important? 
Liseth: 
As an organization it's very important so people can join, and at least learn. 
Pat Francois: 
Especially for the workers. 
Liseth: 
Learn the bill of rights, [00:51:00] because what happening is that some people 
don't complain because they're afraid, and I understand their frightened-ness. 
They have background and their family who support, so they're in school, their 
children in school. Like in my position, my grandmother passed away a few days 
before the [inaudible 00:51:25]. She was 100 years and she was celebrating her 
100, and [00:51:30] she died that day. I was so sad because I spoke her in the 
morning and she said, "Come. I want to see you." I said, "I can't go. You won't 
die." She say, "Yes." I say, "No." She pass away later on, so everybody we have a 
reason. That's what I expect. 
Pat Francois: 
Are you happy with the bills impact? Are you happy with the impact the bill of 
rights [00:52:00] made? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
20
Liseth: 
For the department of labor yes, for the other side no, because as I explained 
already. These people taking advance. Okay, they have your rights, now we have 
our rights. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. Could we pause for one second? 
Speaker 3: 
Sure. 
Pat Francois: 
I can't take it no more. 
Speaker 3: 
It's okay. It sounds like you have a good relationship with the family. 
Liseth: 
The [00:52:30] secret, you have to keep your distance. 
Speaker 3: 
Yeah. Could you tell me a bit more about ... Did you have a particular situation 
where you needed to keep the distance, or didn't keep the distance and you got 
... It turned out bad or something, how did you learn that, to keep the distance? 
Liseth: 
The experience that my ... When I started in the market as a teenagers, 
everybody when in the job years ahead of me. 
Speaker 3: 
I can- 
Liseth: 
That's how I got in the market, [00:53:00] and all of them, my lesson and friend, 
she was in a job for 50 years. One weekend they called her, "Don't come 
anymore, because we don't need anymore. The child is going to school full-
time." 
Speaker 3: 
I see. 
Liseth: 
That's how we get in. My other friend was 20 years with a housekeeper, and 
one day I was with her. It's funny, because we get in. She said, "Good morning 
Mrs [Gorsin 00:53:27] I'm not feeling okay." [00:53:30] She goes like, "Go home. 
You don't feel okay, why I want you here?" She kick us like that. Seeing all these 
things that I being see it, that's how I'm keeping my distance. I'm sure my boss is 
not being so happy, because they're thinking if I'm mellow they're taking ... They 
will be okay in taking advantage of me. Not because they do love it. 
Speaker 3: 
Got it, [00:54:00] so you feel like you've seen people just immediately get fired 
or be asked- 
Liseth: 
Yes, first thing they're done. One time I was in vacation and I always get job for 
my friends. My work vacation, because I want to have my family, especially my 
brother was little when I had my parent, because the eye glass is very 
expensive. Everything is from your money, from your pocket. Not from the 
government. [00:54:30] My president says, he's right. "I didn't ask you to have 
children." He's right. I respect him. It's right. No one asked you to have children, 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
21
it's your own children. That's what make me always worry about it, and it's 
funny, because when my brothers turn 18 we have the money for his eye. The 
transplant, and he goes, "I don't want eye. Who wants eye? I don't need an eye, 
do you need [00:55:00] an eye?" He's like, "Give me that money." He open a 
business, so he's okay. He married and he has two children. 
Speaker 3: 
That's amazing. Did he ever get an eye? 
Liseth: 
No, the glass. He got the glass. 
Speaker 3: 
He got the glass, right. That's amazing. 
Liseth: 
Yeah, but that was our goal. To save the money for him to have his own eye, 
because the doctor say when he's turn 18 we can do a transplant, because all he 
needs to ... 
Speaker 3: 
He's developed. 
Liseth: 
Yeah. 
Speaker 3: 
Right. 
Liseth: 
He didn't want an eye. 
Speaker 3: 
That's amazing. 
Liseth: 
In my case, [00:55:30] that's why I tell people. They should understand, they 
accept their jobs for little money, because everyone we have responsibilities. I 
be having my brother. Nothing that they force somebody, something that you 
want to do it, you know? 
Speaker 3: 
Right. How have you managed to keep a distance with families? Are there some 
particular things you do to keep a distance between? 
Liseth: 
I'm very serious. I know they [00:56:00] thinking I'm very serious too, but I told 
them- 
Speaker 3: 
Hold on. Let me get that. What were you saying? I'm sorry. 
Liseth: 
Since they interview me, I always been telling them I'm very busy person. I have 
a lot of things to do after work, so when we talk to just, things only from the 
child. 
Speaker 3: 
Got it, so you keep ... 
Liseth: 
[00:56:30] Yeah, and when we have a conversation very serious like this, and I 
say, "I'm sorry. Got to go, I need to run." Like this. With the twins’ mom, when 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
22
the boys stopped full-time school, she started like, "The boys love you. How 
they love you, what are they going to do without you?" Things like that, so she 
keep going, keep going. I was listening to her and she goes like, "Well, I have 
here my schedule. [00:57:00] Sometimes I need you in the morning, sometimes 
in the afternoon, sometimes at night. Sometimes, probably I will need only 
three times a week full-time, sometimes only two days. Sometimes when we go 
away we can do share with my friends. We can split with my friends," so I said, 
"Thank you so much. I appreciate your love, but I have a lot of people to 
support. [00:57:30] I have rent," and she asked me ... When she hear what my 
answer she goes, "Don't worry Liseth. My cousin wants to give you job. 
Tomorrow you're going to interview my cousins." I went and he said, "Next 
week you start full-time." 
Speaker 3: 
Really? 
Liseth: 
Yeah. That's how I'm in the job I am. 
Speaker 3: 
You got it from her? 
Liseth: 
Yeah, and you see what she asked me before? 
Speaker 3: 
Right, I see. You kept up a wall and said, "No. I won't do that," but then you got 
... 
Liseth: 
Yeah. 
Speaker 3: 
[00:58:00] She was ready to take advantage of you. Just saying- 
Liseth: 
She just was ready to see if I say, "Yes." You see? All this experience that I've 
been having in that way. That made me be far from them. 
Speaker 3: 
That's such an interesting thing, just talk about boundaries. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Speaker 3: 
You would think that the right thing to do is to be okay with them praising you, 
and saying, "The kids love you," and trying to make everyone fall [00:58:30] in 
love with you. That could lead to exploitation, which seems to be a big- 
Liseth: 
Yeah, because it's funny. In this job, the cousins pay me more than her. 
Speaker 3: 
Really? 
Liseth: 
Yeah, and it's less job. I feeling more because, I don't know. The child is very 
active, but sometimes that's what I said before. I feel I'm working more than the 
twins, maybe because I used to the twins more. She pay more than her.

Speaker 3: 
Right, [00:59:00] that's amazing. 
Liseth: 
Yeah, so that's why I'm telling my friends. Love you is only from hear out, so that 
experience have me, have this in my mind. 
Speaker 3: 
It's important. 
Liseth: 
Yeah. 
Speaker 3: 
You articulated that really well. We've been hearing a lot about that, but I think 
you made it. That's an important point. Thank you. 
Liseth: 
You're welcome. 
Pat Francois: 
What do you want legislators [00:59:30] to know? 
Liseth: 
I let them know that all countries, all we want for immigrants, everywhere we 
are, that's how the world make for immigrants. We are here to make our lives 
better, and as humans we deserve to treat us with any respect as another 
worker, because it's a [01:00:00] job. I know cleaning it doesn't have a title, but 
it's a job. It's a responsibility. 
Pat Francois: 
It is. 
Liseth: 
That's why I don't understand why people say we don't have brain. How, if the 
brain control the bodies? I have to tell, I wish them help us to have the amnesty, 
so all we have better life. I'm sure they were born from immigrants too, because 
everybody we were born from immigrants. I don't understand in this country, 
why some they forgot that. [01:00:30] Someone had to immigrate to this 
country, so that's how I'm here. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. Well, I could remember when the Domestic Workers United were vying for 
that bill, and were going to the legislators and the senators. I could remember 
Senator Bill Perkins, he signed on our bill hence the reason his mom, his mother, 
was a domestic worker. The work that his [01:01:00] mother have done as a 
domestic worker, had put him through school and college and make him go to 
study to be a legislator as he is. Sitting in Congress to sign this bill into law. 
Liseth: 
It's the job that opens the door, and we not only domestic we are exploited. I 
have a cousin working in constructions and their men, [01:01:30] and their boss 
is going to vacation for two months, but they don't have money for pay them. 
For them going to vacations they do. 
Pat Francois: 
Exploitations. 
Liseth: 
I have to say that, unfortunately, now that this year ... I only call that people 
European, because as a Latino you have Europeans too. They were born from 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

immigrants too. I hope they help us to have better future for everybody and all. 
Like humans. 
Pat Francois: 
[01:02:00] Yes. What area of education/skills are you looking to gain? 
Liseth: 
I would like to be personal training, and soon I finish nursing. After that I want 
to go in nutritionist, and after that I want to be a medical assistant. 
Pat Francois: 
You [01:02:30] have it lined up for you. 
Liseth: 
Thanks to this job as a nanny I'm able to do it. That's why I keep doing nanny, 
because it's a decent job. I always say do you prefer I'm sell cocaine or 
marijuana to this mothers, so we doing these things to keep honest people. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. What skills did Domestic Workers United teach you, and what type of 
training? 
Liseth: 
The first [01:03:00] one that I have and I love was the nanny training of 
University of Cornell. I was working with the twins and I learned a lot with them. 
The doctors, things like what to do, what not to do and what to do with the 
parents doing wrong things. How to learn signs, if the children being abused. 
Not from you, from others, and I do [01:03:30] how they call this? House 
management. 
Pat Francois: 
House management. 
Liseth: 
From this woman who was managing for many years too. I love that. Helps me a 
lot, to learn safety, because I'm doing housekeepers too part time. When 
someone need it, and I used to use a lot of bleach to leave the tiles bright. It's 
funny, because now- 
Pat Francois: 
The fumes wasn't good [01:04:00] for you. 
Liseth: 
Now I start to, my eyes when the sun, very sensitive. Now I can feel. I was so 
happy, so I learn that I shouldn't do those things. Actually, talking about that I'm 
so happy. [inaudible 01:04:12] housekeepers, we have to have that training. 
From how to prevent all that hazard things. 
Pat Francois: 
Chemicals. 
Liseth: 
Yeah, and- 
Lizeth: 
Now I start to- my eyes when there is sun- very sensitive. Now I can feel it but I 
was so happy, so I learned that I shouldn't do those things. So, you know, 
actually, talking about that I'm so happy OSHA is coming. Like, housekeepers we 
have to have that training from how to prevent all that [inaudible 00:00:21] 
harsher things. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
25
Pat Francois: 
[crosstalk 00:00:20] chemicals and ... 
Lizeth: 
Yeah. And, they said we must have a card that we did that training, so, I 
[inaudible 00:00:26] OSHA for construction. So I'm happy that come up because 
all by [00:00:30] the women need ... 
Pat Francois: 
Good. 
Lizeth: 
... all the housekeeper needs to know. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Lizeth: 
You know, now I using a lot of baking soda with vinegar. And the tiles and 
[inaudible 00:00:37] everything get sparkling. 
Pat Francois: 
The baking soda? 
Lizeth: 
Yeah, I mix baking soda with ... And I learn in this house management. 
Pat Francois: 
Okay. 
Lizeth: 
Yeah. Very good. You know. 
Pat Francois: 
Okay. What do you mix baking soda with? 
Lizeth: 
Baking soda, vinegar. 
Pat Francois: 
Vinegar. 
Lizeth: 
[inaudible 00:00:52] a paste.  
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Lizeth: 
You see that the tile gets shiny like new. My [inaudible 00:00:54] been asking 
me "Wow, what a shiny bathtub." 
Pat Francois: 
Yes.  
Lizeth: 
Yeah. 
Pat Francois: 
[00:01:00] Good, good, good, good. So besides, you know, that, did you learn 
any other type of training? 
Lizeth: 
I think in a lot of- I learned- all the, I [crosstalk 00:01:18] ... 
Pat Francois: 
CPR? Did you do CPR? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
26
Lizeth: 
I did, I did CPR, but we did it together with [inaudible 00:01:23] a nanny trainer- 
it was included. Remember?  
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Lizeth: 
It was included CPR with [inaudible 00:01:25] nanny training. 
Pat Francois: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Lizeth: 
I has a child pathology, all kind [00:01:30] of things. 
Pat Francois: 
Child ... 
Lizeth: 
Yeah. 
Pat Francois: 
... pediatrics? 
Lizeth: 
Yeah. All that's included in nanny training. A lot of things included in nanny 
training. 
Pat Francois: 
Right. 
Lizeth: 
For child care. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Lizeth: 
And another one I did was to learn colonialism. Remember the, the trainer who 
were doing with ... 
Pat Francois: 
The leadership trainer ... 
Lizeth: 
Leadership training. 
Pat Francois: 
... about colonialism ... 
Lizeth: 
Yeah. All the things ... 
Pat Francois: 
About the history ... 
Lizeth: 
History of the United States. 
Pat Francois: 
Right. 
Lizeth: 
We were doing ... You know the one trainer was [00:02:00] coming a lot of 
questions about- it's- that questions coming with the American citizen 
[inaudible 00:02:06] a lot of from the United States. It was included in the 
leadership, I think. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
27
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Lizeth: 
Yeah, because when the leadership [crosstalk 00:02:12]... 
Pat Francois: 
[inaudible 00:02:13] citizenship and all these things. 
Lizeth: 
They include a lot of things that are included in the program and they call just 
leadership, you remember? We do a [inaudible 00:02:19] Murphy's, Murphy's 
Institute. 
Pat Francois: 
Globalization. 
Lizeth: 
Yeah. All that kind of things, yes. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Lizeth: 
I've been doing all that in the [inaudible 00:02:25]. 
Pat Francois: 
[crosstalk 00:02:26] learning from domestic workers, yes. 
Lizeth: 
Yeah. I know I learned that some people being, you know, [00:02:30] like, they 
have no idea [inaudible 00:02:32] from skin care and I win a little cream and 
they, they were like "How a nanny knows about skin care?" You know? I say ... 
Pat Francois: 
I know.  
Lizeth: 
That's how, we don't have brain, I answer, you know? 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. But what they don't know, some of us come well educated from our 
countries. Some of us came, you know, real, you know, we left highly paid jobs. 
We come as qualified [00:03:00] teachers, as qualified nurses. 
Lizeth: 
Yeah, but, here, that doesn't count, because ... 
Pat Francois: 
[crosstalk 00:03:04]. No, it didn't count.  
Lizeth: 
Yeah. 
Pat Francois: 
But the reason why for leaving our countries ... 
Lizeth: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Pat Francois: 
... is due to the economical downfall and, and, and the worldwide, when you 
look at it. 
Lizeth: 
Yeah, this all, all worldwide. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
28
Pat Francois: 
Worldwide. 
Lizeth: 
Yeah. 
Pat Francois: 
It's all worldwide. 
Lizeth: 
We have, you know ... 
Pat Francois: 
Not just in one country. 
Lizeth: 
We have a better life. Unfortunately, you know? 
Pat Francois: 
So this ... My understanding is [00:03:30] one of the reasons why people left 
their country come looking for a better living, also to help their families back 
home. Sometimes they send their kids to proper schools that they didn't for ... 
In general, they have a better life than, than they have. 
Lizeth: 
Yeah. The ... Well they don't understand that, like, we are here, right? But things 
that we are here, they can do, you know, get hired to, because they can, their 
[inaudible 00:04:00] work, [00:04:00] with activities. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Lizeth: 
You know, what we do with our nanny? I give example ... If [inaudible 00:04:04] 
they do one dollar equal one [inaudible 00:04:09] quetzal, no one's gonna be 
here. 
Pat Francois: 
Right. 
Lizeth: 
Because there no reason, because it's gonna be equal the money. The reason 
we are here because when I send there is a double and I can do more [inaudible 
00:04:18] to help. I always, you know, do things in United States too. Like, I love, 
I love the United States because, you know ... 
 
And another thing that people don't understand ... Like, in my case, [inaudible 
00:04:25], there was a woman that almost kicked me out the window [00:04:30] 
when I said like- she said to me, "You should be proud you are an American." I 
say, I'm sorry, I were born in Central America so I'm an American too. And she 
was saying, like "No, over there is not America." I say yes, we have Central 
America, we have South America, Mexico is North America. She almost killed 
me when I say Mexico is in North America. So these people, I don't know if they 
don't know what, but, this America continent is not only the United States. 
That's why when I ask me, I said no I'm not in America, I'm in the United 
[00:05:00] States of North America, because, [inaudible 00:05:02] background is 
Central America. So, that's a lot of issue, but, what we can do?  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
29
 
Another thing I notice here, immigrants exploitating immigrants. You know, like, 
people has ... I was, I was working with a woman who became America 
residence, so she put in her mind because she became American residence and 
American citizens, we were there to, you know, to be her slave, [00:05:30] to 
kiss her feet. I did, I did with part-time and like weekends. Some her friend 
refers me there and I want to do extra money and then she wanted me to, 
before to leave, to ask her. And one time I say why should I ask you to leave if, if 
my, my shift finish at three o'clock? You know, things like that? 
Pat Francois: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Lizeth: 
And I ... It's funny because she never left the money. She always was three 
thirty, so she ... You know, this is me ... One time [00:06:00] you late [inaudible 
00:06:02] is fine. Second time is okay. Third time, I don't work for you. 
Pat Francois: 
You make it [inaudible 00:06:06] habit. 
Lizeth: 
Yeah. So ... 
Pat Francois: 
Yeah. 
Lizeth: 
... this ... And these people were immigrant. What happened is I explained to 
them, like, people like ask we are here by our own. These people, they have 
family who invest for them, different, you know, different balance ... 
Pat Francois: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative).  
Lizeth: 
... so they don't understand that. I'm not saying no one forced us to be here, but 
as a human, the world is full of immigrants. That's how ... 
Pat Francois: 
[00:06:30] Immigrants built this country. 
Lizeth: 
That's how the world is. All the countries have immigrants. 
Pat Francois: 
Immigrants built the countries. 
Lizeth: 
All the countries, you know, all countries. 
Pat Francois: 
Oh yes. Do you have any last words or parting shots you would like to share? 
Lizeth: 
Like what kind of ... 
Pat Francois: 
Any last words? Any last thoughts that you would like to leave with Domestic 
Workers United? 
Lizeth: 
[inaudible 00:06:58] as I said in my focus in my [00:07:00] mind is we get the 
[inaudible 00:07:02] documented ... 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
30
Pat Francois: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Lizeth: 
... so when no one's afraid, like, you have Green Card? Here my Social Security, 
my work permit and thank ... You know what I did one person one time? She 
said you have a Green Card and I said thank you so much, but I'm not interested 
in travel. You ask me for Social Security, work permit, it's different thing. Or 
taxes. Yeah, because American residents want it for travel. [00:07:30] So that ... 
I really focus on [inaudible 00:07:34] that give the opportunity [inaudible 
00:07:36].  
 
I know, you know, as a group, some people do bad thing, but, now [inaudible 
00:07:42]. All people [inaudible 00:07:45], some people will do good, some 
people will do bad.  
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Lizeth: 
It's international. All over the world, not only our people. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Lizeth: 
With any place. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. 
Lizeth: 
I mean, we not terrorists, you know, I mean, I never do something to harm the 
United States, you know? [00:08:00] We're, we're workers. 
Pat Francois: 
Right? 
Lizeth: 
Yeah, we're workers, you know? 
Pat Francois: 
Yeah. We are the workers. The mighty mighty workers. 
Lizeth: 
Yeah.  
Pat Francois: 
So Miss Lizeth, I want to thank you. 
Lizeth: 
You're welcome. 
Pat Francois:
