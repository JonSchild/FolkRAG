This is a 
"poor quality" recording of the formal program held at All-
State Italian Day, Lagoon Resort, on Sunday, 12 August 1990. 
This event is 
sponsored annually by the Men's and Women's Chapters of the Italian American 
Civic League, headquartered in Salt Lake City. 
The formal program is 
comprised of invited speakers, usually prominent members of the Italian 
community and politicians. 
Since 1990 was an election year, numerous 
candidates participated. 
The first recorded speaker was Dr. Giovanni Maschero, recently appointed 
Italian Vice-Consul for Salt Lake City. 
[Note: 
background voices heard 
during the taping are those of Maria Notarianni, Joyce Notarianni, and Phil 
Notarianni]. 
Maschero talked of preserving "our" heritage, and the need to 
do so. 
He also mentioned his responsibility to help with any paper work 
involving correspondence to Italy. 
Dr. Maschero is a 
practicing chiropractor 
who has converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
(Mormons). 
Next, various politicians were introduced and allowed to speak. 
First, 
Salt Lake County Commissioner Tom Shimizu thanked the Italians for their 
positive contributions to Salt Lake County and the State of Utah. 
Second, 
Salt Lake County Treasurer, Art Monson, urged people to appeal their property 
evaluations. 
Third, Salt Lake County Attorney, Dave Yocum, sought political 
help in county government and campaigned for Democratic candidates, including 
himself. 
Fourth, Salt Lake City Mayor Palmer Depaulis, spoke of the 
generosity of the Italian community. 
He emphasized the strength of having 
ethnic diversity in Salt Lake City and stated that such diversity was part of 
his own history. 
Other candidates were recognized and allowed to speak. 
As part of the program of the Italian American Civic League is the 
granting of university and college scholarships to graduating high school 
seniors of Italian descent. 
This is done annually at the All-State Italian 
Day program. 
Attached to this report is a 
copy of the official program which 
discusses the winners and their backgrounds. 
Also, special awards were given 
for service rendered to the IACL. 
Ed Terrill was singled-out as the 
outstanding new member. 
The remaining events of the day were announced and the afternoon program 
ended. 
The tape continued to run, but only background noise can be heard.

This interview concerns the reactions of Joe Bonacci, and his parents, 
Vito and Filomena Bonacci, to their 1983 trip back to Vito's hometown of 
Decollatura, Province of Catanzaro, Calabria, Italy. 
Joe's brother, Domenic, 
also accompanied them. 
Joe emphasized that Vito wanted the entire family to take the trip. 
Joe 
desired to meet the family, especially his uncle Carmine. 
He wished to see 
the places that his father had talked about as Joe was growing up. 
Vito's 
stories, according to Joe, were often "lessons." 
Vito described how nick 
names were given to people who had basically the same names. 
One example, was 
the name "Palo firmo" to someone who placed a 
stick under his arm so as not to 
fall asleep when he was watching sheep. 
Vito was concise -- "if you do 
something, do it right," he often said. 
A 
first observation of Italy for Joe 
was his disbelief in the distances that his father walked as a 
youth. 
Of particular importance to Joe and Domenic was to see the "family" 
home, but their uncle was reluctant to show it to them. 
They do not know why. 
However, they did see the home where Filomena's grandfather was born. 
[Note, 
the interviewer Phil Notarianni has also seen these homes and has photographs 
of them]. 
The group first arrived in Rome and stayed there prior to leaving by air 
for Lamezia Terme, a 
coastal city in Calabria near Catanzaro. 
They could not 
believe the terrain. 
In entering Decollatura, Vito said, "This isn't 
Decollatura. 
This isn't where I 
came from." 
Joe added, "We all chuckled." 
"Dad, it's been forty years." 
After a 
short time Vito recalled the area well. 
"I enjoyed it over there," said Joe. 
Domenic had a 
more difficult time 
primarily because of the language. 
Joe, who had studied for the Roman 
Catholic priesthood, was quite familiar with Latin and could handle Italian "a 
little" better. 
In addition, as a 
child Joe mentioned that he had 
communicated often with Franca and Rosina Molinaro, who were Italian 
immigrants to Carbon County. 
Filomena, Joe and Domenic's mother, speaks 
Italian well. 
Their grandmother came to Carbon County in 1908, lived until 
1956, and spoke little English. 
Meeting his uncle Carmine Bonacci made Joe feel "Italian." 
All 
participants in the interview laughed as Joe admitted that his uncle and 
father had the same temperament. 
Joe talked of his uncle's perceptions of 
Italian and American politics. 
Again, he brought up his difficulty with the 
Italian language. 
Carmine hated Franklin Roosevelt because he gave away 
"things" that belonged to Italy. 
Joe said that his father was a 
true 
Democrat. 
"If Jesus Christ ran on the Republican Party, he'd [Vito] vote 
against him!" 
Food was the next subject of discussion. 
Joe and Domenic found it very 
difficult not to eat an "American" style breakfast. 
In fact, Filomena brought 
instant coffee with them. 
After their parents were through using "full size" 
50 
cups, Joe and Domenic would drink their coffee. 
Joe responded to a 
question 
about Italian food by noting that they ate Italian food at home, but "American 
style." 
The seven course meal was often too much. 
Joe's uncle took them to a 
restaurant for dinner. 
Joe observed that the 
"transaction of money was all done afterwards in the office." 
The uncle 
negotiated the price. 
There was a 
First Communion dinner being held at the 
restaurant at the same time. 
Joe described a 
"laid life back style." 
This made him nervous he said. 
He admitted to having been "too American." 
,beanie Crocco, from Carbon County, had asked Joe to bring back-a--spice 
called "aranzo" or anise seeds. 
ShP used—theae for "fresine" a "taralle." 
Joe said that the custom agent in New York inquired about them. 
Such seeds 
are difficult to get in Italy because they are very time consuming to gather, 
dry, and separate. 
They bought them in Nicastro at a 
corner grocery store. 
He said anise seeds in Italy are of a 
"better quality" than what can be 
purchased in Utah. 
"I liked the crusty bread," Joe admitted. 
/At home Filomena always made 
homemade bread 
NP +mold of, as a 
child 
having a 
sandwich made of h•made 
bread, "capocollo," and sweet pickles and trading it for a 
sandwich of Wonder 
Bre
— 
ad 
wit5ologna and mayonnaise !
 [Laughter]. 
"I had it and we wanted 
something different." 
Joe did not like the ricotta cheese in Italy. 
They ate pork-related 
products, and he said that people now talk of cholesterol in Italy. 
He 
observed that in home canning, they use capped "beer" bottles as canning jars. 
They ate "pasta and piselli" (pasta and peas ), using home canned peas (done by 
his bachelor uncle). 
The use of flowers on verandas pleased Joe. 
"I liked them." 
Carnations 
and gladiolus were used in the cemeteries . Joe noted that in the cemeteries 
every grave had flowers . He explained the existence of mausoleums as a 
"class 
distinction thing." 
A 
relative of Mike Molinaro of Helper teaches at the university in 
Catanzaro. 
He was glad to see the Bonaccis and "repay" Vito for his helping 
Mike. 
Joe said that they did not go to any festivals or feasts, but did visit 
the Sila area [an alpine-type area with pine trees and lakes]. 
People were 
selling their wares. 
Joe recalled the decorated "mussaloe. " The family also 
visited San Giovanni in Fiore, because "there are a 
lot of those people living 
in Carbon County" (such as the Angotti and Eaquinta families). 
Vito 
apparently always mentioned San Giovannese (people from San Giovanni). 
Vito 
talked of having worked on a 
dam in the Sila, and he mentioned numerous towns 
near Decollatura. 
In speaking of shopping in Nicastro, Joe mentioned that he liked 
cappucino. 
He then quipped that people could tell he and Domenic were 
American by looking at their shoes. 
Joe related an interesting incident. 
One day while he and Domenic were 
having their morning coffee, Vito was outside talking to someone. 
The sons 
looked out the window and Domenic said, "If that isn't Ross Sacco, it's his 
relative." 
Ross Sacco lived in Carbon County, but the gentleman turned out to 
be a 
cousin, Benito Sacco. 
There were two brothers, Benito and Vittorio 
(named after Mussolini and King Victor Emanuel II). 
There fathers had a 
"falling out" over property. 
The two families separated and immigrated to the 
United States and Australia. 
Ironically, the two raise horses in their 
respective homes. 
51 
"We graved cold water," Joe said. 
They walked to the "fontana" 
(fountain) all of the time. 
Italians believe that cold water is harmful, 
especially on a 
hot day. 
Warm beer bothered Joe too, but wine was always 
served at room temperature, and at every meal. 
Joe re-emphasized that the stories told by Vito of his hometown were 
always on his mind. 
Vito "always" talked of Decollatura. 
In responding to a 
question regarding similarities between Italy and Carbon County, Joe stated, 
"the rock masonry that they did -- I 
can see a 
lot of that here. . . 
they all 
built their houses that way, over there, and that's the way a 
lot of Utah 
Italians in this area built their homes." 
Carmine did all of his ditch work 
in rock. 
"Everything was rock. . . 
I 
guess that was something they learned 
from their youth, to build with that sandstone rock. . . 
I 
thought of the old 
rock cellar that grandpa had over here in the front. . 
.I guess that's what 
those people knew." 
Filomena's fathers always built in rock.

Joe described the homes in Italy. 
He also mentioned Ralph Scalzo, who 
had lived in Carbon County and moved back to Decollatura. 
Joe last saw Ralph 
in California. 
Phil and Maria compared their experiences with Joe's. 
Joe joked about going to the beach and how Italians drive -- fast! 
Domenic quipped that they should retire in Italy and open up a 
brake shop. 
Joe also mentioned the "cucina Americana," American kitchens, and how they are 
prevalent in Italian homes. 
The hall mark of such kitchens is the built in 
cabinets. 
He mentioned how conservative his uncle was with water, and how it 
was stressed not to drink tap water from the house, but the "fresh" water from 
the fountain.

The interview began with Mary reciting poetry that she had written. 
On 
a 
"special occasion" in July 1931 she was looking at a 
tree and thinking of 
hanging herself. 
She noticed how beautiful the world was and wrote "Our 
Beautiful World." 
"It was a 
thank you to the Lord for resurrecting my ugly 
mind." 
That is how Mary Juliano started writing poetry -- "from that one bad 
thought came my poetry." 
She described stories of her poetry and how she 
recited it for school groups, such as the poem about the "split jackass," 
based on a 
funny incident involving her two boys. 
She recited "The Roses of 
Yesterday" in English and in Italian. 
She preforms very dramatically, saying 
"it was from my heart." 
She translated her poems into Italian, after 
composing them in English, because she loves the language [Italian]. 
"I'm 
just a 
joker like my poppy." 
She began singing a 
song, "It's Crying Time 
Again" -- a 
song that she wrote. 
As she sang, the lyrics moved from English 
into Italian. 
"I look crude, but I'm very sentimental, capice [understand]?" 
Mary was born in San Giovanni in FioreCalabria, 
_Italy. As c• 
rs cribed those yearc in ttatT emotion f; Upe 
her words. Papa 
and Mama married -- he left for America. He waited five years to send for  
us. 
L lived with my grandmother, Sarafina. MAry was  extremely close to her 
grandmother, perhaps closer than 
a 
 seams r s. Mary has written a 
poem about leaving her grandmother. 
She 
even recounted a 
story of hav 
isit 
her grandmother 
t 
tt did not work out. 
"I think I 
loved her more than my 
Mama, almost, would you 
eTieve it?" 
"We came to Price in 190 0 [Mary was 
born 2 
September 1904]. 
Papa went to Mohrland; we lived in a 
tent. 
He was a 
shot tirer." 
Mary continued by stating that her papa left Mohrland and went to the 
company town of Hiawatha, then to Spring Glen, and finally to Price. 
She 
married John JO iatlo, a 
miner, in 1927. 
They eventually moved to Standard, 
then to -Price where they 
ut 
eir ho 
1, but rented it out for nine 
years, moving into it i
—n-T940-41. 
John died on 5 
August 1984. 
John was born 
near San Giovanni in Fiore. 
She described how they met -- through a 
"compari" 
Bill [Oliveto]. 
Mr. Oliveto told John of Mary and they were introduced. 
Mary learned to crochet while going to school. 
Her aunt Delina Cortese 
taugtrt her. 
"I croc e e 
one. 
Her mother sewed by 
an 
ut bought 
a 
second-hand sewing mac ine t 
at was "easy for Mary to run the treadle." 
So, 
since the age of nine, Mary sewed all the time. 
The Nicks lived on a 
farm. Mary recalled "Rosie the goat," a 
pet. 
They 
had a 
mirk cow and hogs, all for home use. 
They usually slaughtered the pigs 
in late Fall. 
"Papa killed the pig." 
He used a 
large sl 
ge hammer to knock 
it out 
then stabbed it 
letti 
blee 
It was then hoisted up on a 
support and c 
eaned, after the hair was rPmov—pT—
Plr. Nock then ran Wd the 
liver, 
eart, an 
intestines. 
Mary and her mother would clean the intestines 
s 
54 
4 
to be used for sausage and "suppressata" casings. 
Water was used to flush out 
the intestines. Th v made, 
 "saus_4ge hams, and bacon." The vat that was used 
to soak the "prosciutto" was made from a 
wine barrel. 
Mary recalled that her 
papa made wine for some French Deople in Carbon County. 
It sawed the barrel 
in two and that is where he soa<ed the hams. 
Her discussion seemed to center 
around the ideas of "quality and tine." 
"It was _a  lot of work." 
They made 
liver and lung sausage for "minestra" [soup. 
One or two men would come to 
help. 
The neck meat was cooked immediately for the day's meal. 
Mary had to 
eat a 
piece of the liver. 
The fat was used for lard and "frisuli." 
Mary 
often referred to the amount of work involved. 
The used "finocchio" [fennel] 
in their sausage mixture. Black pepper was put into the "suppressata." 
"Capocollo" and prosciuttos took "time" to cure. 
"I can't understand doing 
all of that work." 
One or two pigs were usually killed. 
Corn was the main 
feed for these animals. 
They also made cheese -- primarily four kinds. 
Tablets to allow the 
milk to curd were used. 
They made "asciungata." 
When the mixture first began 
to "glauber" that was the "sciungata." 
Mary described the making of provolone 
cheese. 
They sold cheese, vegetables and meat in Sunnyside. 
"I loved 
ricotta," and ate it with bread after it was made. 
Mary also talked of her date cake, which she discovered and "modified" 
from a 
recipe. 
Her recipe went all through Carbon County. 
One of her 
modifications was that she cut the cake in bars because "it looked nicer." 
They also made "fritti or grispelle" [similar to scones]. 
Mary could not 
recall if her daughter learned to make them. 
Again, Mary talked of the time 
element  
_saying, "to 
it w 
sn't time 
it was a 
w —of li#-e." 
"Papa" Nick and a 
friend made an outdoor domed baking oven for the 
family. 
Mary had to clean it. 
They used a 
mixture of 100 lbs. of flour for 
one batch of bread. 
She recalled using wooden "tools" to prepare the oven and 
bake the bread. 
A 
wooden "ladle" was used to put the bread in the oven, 
starting at the rear of the dome. 
They made "pita," adding oil, sauce, and 
other ingredients. 
A 
fire was started in the middle of the oven using soft, 
sweet wood, to enhance the taste. 
The oven had to be clean! 
Later, bread was 
made in the coal stove. 
After Mary married, they did not make sausage. 
John 
loved "rigatoni." 
In describing Christmas Eve dinner, Mary mentioned that the family ate 
fish, either smelts or halibut, with some type of vegetable. 
This was a 
time 
of fasting. 
She recalled eating cabbage, and "elbow" noodles. 
"Mama made 
noodles." 
Also, her mother made dumplings, "regular English dumplings [not 
necessarily gnocchi]. 
Mary taught Mrs. Foto Liapis [a Greek neighbor] how to 
make dumplings. 
"Greek people are very generous." 
Mary remembered the Olivetto family in Hiawatha, but she stated that 
there "weren't too many," but that she "hasn't thought about it." 
"My life wasn't easy," Mary retorted, "but I've had some beautiful 
friends." 
She articulated a 
desire to return to Italy, showing a 
deep love 
for her grandmother. 
Again, Mary mentioned having been raised by her 
grandmother, and broke into song, singing "ti voglio bene" [I love you]. 
This 
led Mary into more songs. 
She mentioned that her father sang "bosco nero" 
[black forest] -- she sang some verses. 
It was a 
story of a 
young man who 
lost his love in the forest. 
Her papa would tell her the stories of the 
songs. 
"I was the only one interested -- I 
understood the language better."

Mary told a 
story of an old man who collected wood who concealed a 
young 
man who had been wrongly accused of murder. 
The authorities arrived [now she 
began to speak in Italian], and they wanted to look in the pile of wood, where 
the young man was hiding. 
The old man pleads with them not to disturb his 
wood since it is his living. 
They leave. 
The young man, who as it turned out 
came from a 
very rich family, brought the old timer back to the palace where 
he lived a 
lazy life. 
Mary told another tale involving the military [a 
colonel] and her father. 
The children always asked their father to tell 
stories. 
"Mama had a 
brilliant mind, but no chance to go to school." 
Maria 
Notarianni asked Mary to sing "Santa Lucia." 
Mary added that the song was not 
about Saint Lucy, but about a 
sea port in Italy named Santa Lucia. 
She sang 
the song in Italian, then sang another favorite of her sisters [Nick sisters] 
called "0 Marinaro." 
She told of the records in Italian that she collected. 
Mary began to tell of her daughter's singing talent as a 
young woman. 
Jeanie sang as a 
child, in Italian. 
She learned from records. 
Here, Mary had 
a 
difficult time in remembering details. 
She leaves to call her sister Carrie 
to ask what song did Jeanie sing when she was a 
child. 
It was 0 
Marie. 
"I 
Want to be a 
Cowboy Sweetheart" made Jeanie famous. 
The youngster had 
auditions in several Hollywood studios all lined up. 
The night before these 
auditions, Mary went to church to pray for guidance. 
All that night she 
tossed and turned, and came to the realization that perhaps the auditions 
would do harm to the child -- that she, Mary, was doing the wrong thing in 
trying to pursue a 
recording career for her daughter. 
While arguing with her 
sister, Mary decided to go home with Jeanie, and she did. 
Years later, Jeanie 
entered the religious order of the Daughters of Charity. 
Mary talked of 
Jeanie in the order and how she left, but returned. 
A 
proud mother pointed to 
a 
photograph of Jeanie with Pope John Paul II on the television. 
Mary then spoke quite candidly of her son Vince, a 
homosexual who died 
from AIDS. 
She painfully talked of him and his illness and how the family had 
been reconciled before his death. 
"He died a 
beautiful death." 
He was 
cremated and the urn placed in his father's grave in Price.

This recording took place at the store, motel, and service station 
complex of Ross Gigliotti located in Helper, Utah, once called Martin. 
The 
motel and service station are now closed, with only the small store open. 
Mr. Gigliotti began by talking of his birth in 1903 in a 
small village 
near Decoll-tura, Province of Chan 
faro 
r_.alabria, Italy. He remembered 
people having livestock in the house, and the gathering of chestnuts. 
He 
recalled gathering chestnuts in 1913, and traveling through the town of 
Serrastrette. 
[His voice was very faint]. 
He came to the Untted Statet•in 
,_14_1 ,_when his father, Felice Gigliotti, 
returned to pick up the family. Felice came to America in 1907, an tr
—  
ayeTed 
in Canada and to _Spokanp, Washington

stone masoA . He--cake—to Carhon_Couaty to-work. 
He did contract stone work --
a1TT types of stonework. 
"Strombotta"s his nick namQ.
-- Ross remembers his 
fan 
errs story of how they used to play a 
game to see how far they could roll 
a 
round of cheese. 
Ross talked of his father's work. 
Felice built foundations and 
buildings at Hiawatha, and Ross believes that_h_is fat Pr did some work on the 
s 
fo 
en 
houses built for Joe Milano ron Milano Court in Helper]. He chiseled 
and split rock from Spring 
anyonand Hard Scrabble Canyon, and built 
vens in 
sc 
Sunnyside. 
J9e Milano and Felicp Giq_liotti worked together -- Joe, a 
blacksmith, 
sharpened Gigliotti's tools. 
Felice learned the craft in Ftaly, w 
•e 
er 
F
-
ie 
built homes too_ [in  the Decollatura area]. 
He uwd small rocks in Italy,  
and 
Ross guessed that they were better in withstanding earthquakes. Felice made 
three trips to the United States before he came for his nine children. Ross 
hel ed him i 
oun ster 
mostl 
on the Gig -liotti Block, still 
stan in 
across from the store. 
Ross' father also built a 
house on Bryner 
Street -- rock now covered with aluminum. 
Ross worked mostly on the railroad. 
[Interruption as Ross' wife Stella 
returned from a 
Sunday church meeting]. 
Her maiden name was Felice, and they 
were married in 1929. 
He worked for the Castle Valley Railroad for $1.10 a 
day. 
No one wanted to become a 
stone mason because, as Ross explained, "they 
lived in Italy longer than in the United States." 
His brother was detained at 
Ellis Island because of his deafness. 
The others waited as the brother was 
held over until late at night. 
They had to go by boat, which was infested 
with lice, to "Norfolk, West Virginia," where they caught a 
train to Price, 
Utah. 
The family first lived in Hiawatha, near a 
family called Perucci, in a 
house built by Felice out of white and gray rock. 
Ross remembered having his 
father's twenty-pound sledge hammer. 
57 
Ross reminisced of his years in Hiawatha. 
He went to school up to the 
fifth grade, then went to work for the Castle Valley Railroad. 
They had a 
farm but did not have any water rights, which belonged to the coal company. 
He spoke of killing pigs and preparing the meat, but little else. 
[Here, 
Ross' memory appeared to be shaky]. 
In 1919 they moved to Helper. 
The Gigliotti Block was erected in 1926 
and used for rental property. Frank and John Morelli used it-as the Martin 
Store J

ho t

of the photp raphs was Ross' brother, Robert. The building was lost by the 
Gigliotti family during the Great Depression. 
Ross' mother's name was Maria Concetta Perri, also from the Decollatura 
area. 
He again turned to his days in Hiawatha, recalling selling eggs to 
bachelors on weekends. 
He delivered lettuce and onions as well. 
Talked of 
getting into a 
fight with a 
Greek youth. 
His railroad work, at the age of 
twelve, involved carrying ties, cutting wood, and carrying water. 
His pay 
went from $1.10 to $2.10 
to $4.96 a 
day. 
Ross remembered the 1922 strike in 
Carbon County. 
He went on the picket line, and recalled United Mine Workers 
of America organizer Frank Bonacci [also from Decollatura]. 
During that 
strike "scabs" [strike breakers] were sent from Colorado via the Utah Railway, 
where Ross worked. 
He was a 
hostler, who would get cars together. 
When 
workers realized that the train was filled with strike breakers, the train was 
left out in the middle of no where. 
Another engineer was fired. 
Guards and 
superintendent of Standardville went on the train and were fired upon. 
The 
National Guard was eventually called in. 
"I didn't want to go against the union." 
The company fired and rehired 
Gigliotti, but he finally quite and began working for the Union Pacific in 
Magna, Utah [near Salt Lake City]. 
That was in about 1924. 
"I lost a 
good 
job for respecting the union. 
I 
though I 
was doing the right thing by helping 
the miners. 
Dad respected the union."
