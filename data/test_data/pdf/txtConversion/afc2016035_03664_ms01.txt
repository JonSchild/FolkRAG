Kenneth (Kenny) Cohen interviewed by Jaime Lopez and Barrie Cline 
Jaime : You've known about this stuff for quite a while now 
Kenny: Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Jaime: I think you got the low down on the project. 
Kenny: Yes. 
Jaime: We're going to get you to sign the release form afterwards. 
Kenny: Okay. 
Jaime: Don't let us forget that. You already know the jist of it and you've graciously 
welcomed your sister and also your father will join us in this process [crosstalk 
00:00:23]. 
Kenny: Thank you, guys, for allowing us all to participate. 
Jaime: Cool. We're just going to go through some of the questions. You can start off 
[00:00:30] by telling us your, name, your job title, and where you currently live. 
Kenny: Okay. My name is Kenneth Cohen. I guess Kenny Cohen. I'm a journeyman. I was 
initiated into Local Three in 2009. I guess that means I've been for about eight 
years, eight years in September. 
Jaime: Eight years and ... 
Kenny: I'm sorry. I live in Flushing, Flushing, New York. 
Jaime: What's your background? Where were you born and where are you parents 
[00:01:00] from? 
Kenny: I am born and raised in Flushing, Queens. My dad..I actually grew up in the same 
neighborhood my father grew up in. My mother is from California. Actually, I 
guess I have this industry to thank for my existence because my father met my 
mother while he was traveling as an electrician and he was working out in the 
Bay Area in San Jose and that's how they ended up meeting while he was 
[00:01:30] working out there. 
Jaime: Can you tell us a little bit about your job now, your types of work that you've 
been doing, and where you're working now?

I most recently have been working with Wade Electric which is kind of cool 
because it's also the first shop that I worked in as a TA1 apprentice. It [00:02:00] 
was kind of cool to be reintroduced to some of my first journeymen as their 
peer as a fellow journeyman so that was cool. They still do a lot of the 
laboratory buildings and hospitals. 
The first job I was on with them was the science park over on 33rd and 1st 
Avenue and I think they call it the Alexandria. [00:02:30] Then the most recent 
job I was at with them were as a new laboratory for Memorial Sloan Kettering. 
In addition to that, I did a lot of DP work with them as well so galvanized pipe 
and control wiring and stuff like that. 
You said that you were a first-year apprentice with them? 
Yes. 
You went through your apprenticeship. You left the company and then you 
revisited [crosstalk 00:02:53]. 
Ended up getting back thought that shop. It was a kind of cool. It was interesting 
to see how many people still [00:03:00] remember me after all that time. 
How did they receive you? 
Pretty well actually. I get along with everybody. I got along with all the guys I 
used to work with before, and then a few of us follow each other on Facebook. 
We semi-kept in touch over the years, so it was cool to have that warm 
welcome when I got back with the shop. 
Can you take us back to that first day that you worked there? 
My first day of work was [00:03:30] nervous. It was very a lot of nerves flowing. 
When I decided I was going to enter this business, I really didn't know what to 
expect. I avoided it for a longtime primarily because I didn't understand this line 
of work as a way to be successful not [00:04:00] because I didn't see it through 
my father or anything but just because of what I had accepted from peers and 
just, I guess, the rest of society. I was under the impression that the only way to 
be successful was to go to college and get what people accept as a socially 
acceptable and prosperous career. Not only that, I didn't know anything about 
electrical work or construction period. [00:04:30] I was always used to learning 
quickly and knowing pretty much everything before I actually had to do it so this 
is totally left for me. 
I think the first day of work, I might have almost cut my finger off twice just 
trying to keep up. It's like you ... I don't know. Maybe it's a macho thing on a 
construction site or something, but you don't want [00:05:00] to seem like 
you're not following and not able to keep up with the work pace.

Kenny: 
I remember a journeyman had asked me ... I watched him cut a conduit with a 
bandsaw, and I watched him do it all day. Finally, at the end of the day, he's like, 
"Do you feel comfortable enough to go cut six inches off this piece of pipe for 
me?" I said, "Yes, I got it. No problem." I go to the bandsaw and I was watching 
everything but how he held the bandsaw. [00:05:30] I'm holding the bandsaw. I 
have gloves on. I have the part with the trigger on one hand, and then I'm 
holding where the blade rotates in the other hand. As I'm cutting the pipe, it 
was three quarters so it's small. It doesn't take long to cut through it. As I'm 
cutting, I feel something rubbing against my glove, and I'm like, "Wow. What is 
that?" Finally, when I finished cutting through the pipe, I see a slice through my 
gloves. It didn't break skin or anything but I'm like, "Damn. Maybe I did need a 
little ... Maybe I did need a little [00:06:00] more assistance before." 
Once classes started and they started to stress the importance of safety and 
everything and I started to meet other apprentice who knew just as little as me, 
it made me a little more comfortable not knowing. I haven't almost cut my 
finger off since that. 
Kenny, what changed your mind about the electrical industry and how did you 
become an electrician? 
In all honesty, I became an electrician because my mother [00:06:30] filled out 
the application for me, forced me to go and take the test, and told me if I do not 
do well on the test that I'm kicked out of the house. It's weird though because I 
remember being a kid every kid wants to be like their father when they are a 
kid. I did want to be an electrician at some point in life. I guess those other 
influences blocked those memories of wanting to be like [00:07:00] my dad. I 
guess once I got into the business and realized that you can still do everything 
that you have a passion for and be a great electrician and be a great union 
person at the same time, and that there are avenues that help you and embrace 
you in those other things that you like to do in life. That's when I really started 
to understand the dimensions of this [00:07:30] industry. 
Can you flesh those out for us a little bit like what are some of the ... when you 
said everything you always wanted to do or the dimension that you're talking 
about? 
Prior to coming in to Local Three, I was very into community organizing and 
activist work and just being a voice for other people. I guess I felt when I started 
this that I couldn't do that anymore. I guess maybe [00:08:00] that meant I had 
to quit those to start something, a new industry. Then one of the biggest things 
that they ask you to do is to be an advocate for other workers whether it's going 
to a rally to support another union that's on strike, some legislation that has to 
be passed. A lot of times members' families will get sick and we donate money 
to help with [00:08:30] their care or just the overall well-being of the family. 
A lot of the community service work that we do that's all things that I had a 
passion for doing before I got into this industry. I did not know that we were so 
Kenny Cohen

Barrie:

Jaime:

Barrie: 
Jaime: 
Kenny: 
involved in that type advocacy and just overall community help. Had I known 
that, I might have tried to get in a little earlier [00:09:00] sooner. Even a lot of 
my friends, they use the security that they have financially from working in this 
industry to start businesses of their own outside of the electrical industry. 
There's one girl, one of our sisters has her own swimwear line. From what I 
understand, she is doing very well. I know guys who get into real estate. I know 
people who've owned clubs. [00:09:30] These are all things I'm sure they've 
always had aspirations of doing. The financial security of this allows them to 
actually do it and pursue some of those dreams. 
And time, sometimes,right? 
Yes, right. 
Kenny, do you have any family in the business? 
I do. My father is a retired Local 3 member, and my sister is currently an 
apprentice. At least in the second-generation Local Three person and the third- 
generation union member. Both my grandfathers were [00:10:00] teamsters. 
I didn't know that. 
What do you like about this job and some of your current jobs? 
There's a lot to like. I'll try to pinpoint. I like that everything... no day is ever the 
same. [00:10:30] I guess that pretty much sums it up. It's like you can put an 
outlet on a wall every day and something's going to be different about putting 
that outlet in I'm each day whether it's the crew that you're doing it with, the 
shop that you're doing it for, the location in the city that you're doing it, the 
function that that switch is going to perform. [00:11:00] There's always going to 
be something different and I think that keeps it exciting. 
At this point, I don't imagine being a person who goes to the same job every 
single day and sits behind the same desk every single day. I think I'd lose my 
mind doing something like that. I've worked in every single part of the city in all 
five boroughs. I remember as an MU on the van. I [00:11:30] couldn't go on 
certain highways, so I had to make sure I knew how to get around certain 
boroughs without getting all the parkways and things like that. I felt like I was 
turning into my dad because my dad always knew how to avoid traffic. We'd 
cruise through some streets. I don't know if took longer or shorter, but we never 
had to sit in traffic and we got to the endpoint. I found myself doing the same 
thing. [00:12:00] It's cool. It allows you to see your city. It allows you to help 
build the city. Its like every time I take my girl somewhere or take my friends 
somewhere, "I worked on the building." It gives you a different appreciation for 
the city that you live in knowing that you're building it.

Barrie: 
Kenny, can you explain a little bit about your learning process at work and 
through your partnership? 
I think [00:12:30] the process of an apprenticeship is one of the most amazing 
learning experiences. I dabbled in education with kids before I got in the Local 3. 
One of the things that I understood is that when people are learning, they learn 
in various ways. One of the problems with kids being able to retain information 
is that the school system oftentimes doesn't [00:13:00] tap into all those 
different ways that people need to receive knowledge. What's so great about 
the apprenticeship is that regardless of what type of learner you are when 
you're learning a task like there's going to be something ... There's going to be a 
method of teaching that you receive that will allow you to comprehend that. 
You're sitting in school getting the theory, so a lot of the times that's the audio. 
For people that are audio learners, they're learning [00:13:30] the trade that 
way. For people who need to be hands on, you're learning it on the job from 
another journey person. 
If you're better at writing things down, you're taking notes in class or... I knew 
dudes who kept notebooks and pads while on the job and they jot down notes 
either or take pictures as journey people are showing them how to do things. I 
saw a lot of guys looking back at those pictures and stuff in their notes trying to 
figure out how they did that conduit run or something. [00:14:00] It's a very 
unique experience, and not only that, the bonds that you create in this process. 
The generation that comes before you is completely responsible for making sure 
that this industry continues on because they're responsible for teaching the 
generation that's coming up after them. Not only are they responsible for 
teaching it to them, they're responsible [00:14:30] for making them proficient 
and making them comfortable enough to teach the generation that's coming 
after them. If somewhere there's a breakdown in that teaching, then the 
industry dies. It's as important for the person who's learning to receive that 
information or respect the teacher as it is for the teacher to understand the 
importance of passing it on and respect the student. It's a very interesting 
[00:15:00] learning dynamic because there's that respect thing. There's is 
always a respect of student and respect of the teacher is also ... 
[crosstalk 00:15:10] people don't necessarily like each other but if there is that 
respect... 
Yes. One of the hardest parts about this business people always say is not the 
work that we do, but it's dealing with all the different personalities you come 
across. It's very humbling a lot of times. You may not like a person, but in order 
[00:15:30] to get the job done, you have to be best friends for that... until that 
job is done. You may hate each other at the parking lot or on the train on the 
way home, but while you're doing that job, you got to be best friends. Not only 
that, you're life depends on it too. 
That's an interesting skillset to have.

Kenny, how do you find yourself learning these days? What makes it easy for 
you to learn nowadays? 
Honestly, as a young journey person, there's still a lot that I don't know. 
[00:16:00] Recently, I haven't been given a partner a lot so having to figure 
things out has been a very interesting way of learning. I didn't do too much pipe 
bending with the hand bender. Last task that I was given, my forema n gave me a 
few bundles of pipe and a bender and said, "I need you to do all the emergency 
lights on these floors." [00:16:30] You can't tell your foreman you're not too 
sure, so you just have to figure it out. It ended up turning out beautiful. It got 
done in a timeframe where he was very pleased. That's a skill that I was able to 
kind of work on a little bit and perfect a little bit that I wasn't too sure with. Also 
being assigned an apprentice and having to teach them. 
[00:17:00] It's like, for me, I've always retained information better by teaching 
somebody else. I get the knowledge and then give that knowledge to someone 
else. It's been awesome having apprentices and being able to share the little bit 
that I've learned throughout the years to helpthem butalso helpmyself. 
Some of the work felt particularly creative in nature? 
Again, I feel like everything we do is created in nature and I get a feeling 
[00:17:30] of everything we do in creative and artistic. The amount of time and 
detail we put into what we do is something very special. When you can see and 
exposed pipe run and see all the bends bending together and everything just 
flows; that's an art. [00:18:00] Some people outside of the industry can look up 
and appreciate it and recognize it; a lot of people don't but even with traditional 
art a lot of people look at it and think it's amazing and other people don't get it. 
I remember when I was a first-year apprentice with Wade Electric. I was working 
with an MU and it was just me and him. We wired up an entire room for lighting, 
[00:18:30] and it was time for us to turn the breaker on to turn the lights on to 
see if they all work and it was awesome is almost like a ... It was like a like the 
movies. When you turn the power on and it goes joosh! That sound happen and 
all the lights turned on. It almost was like watching a light show for the 
Kosciuszko Bridge or something like, "That was my light [00:19:00] show 
because ..." We did the work to put it on and it came on. That was my first time 
turning on power- or I didn't turn the power he turned the power on- and 
watching our work actually work so it was cool. 
You're telling me that special feeling attached to that. 
Yeah. 
Can you express that feeling? Can you express what it feels like when you turn 
that on or when it comes to completion .. all that hard work? 
Kenny Cohen

Kenny: 
I don't know about [00:19:30] anybody else but I just get like, "Wow, I did that" 
type of feeling. I'm around babies all the time. I have a nephew. I watch my 
niece grow up. When you see them constantly trying to conquer something 
whether it's standing up or taking their first few steps and that excitement that 
they have, a kid making their first basket into the hoop, and they keep trying 
over and over and they're doing all the work to make it happen and it finally 
happens and they get so excited. [00:20:00] I guess the same feeling I get every 
time I complete a task because you put a lot of work and energy and planning 
into the what you do. 
When you finish that task and you see it through, it's a, "Wow. I did that" type 
of feeling. I don't know. I get goosebumps sometimes but I get really attached 
to do what I do. 
[00:20:30] That's cool. 
We're you ever scared of that work or scared of any tool or any specific for 
scheduling tool or a specific job location. 
Obviously, I used to be scared of band saws but... I don't know. It's like I feel like 
when I'm at work there's like a professional adrenaline that takes place because 
typically, I'm afraid of heights. At work, I'm not afraid of heights. I'll [00:21:00] 
put my harness on and I'll climb off the lift and get on a rack of pipes and start 
moving around. I don't do that outside of work, hell no. [crosstalk 00:21:11]. 
That's an interesting way of phrasing it. It was professional adrenaline. 
Yes. I don't know. This is very ... I guess it's like you ... I guess that goes back to 
that macho thing. It's like you can't really be afraid to do something especially if 
no one is asking you to do anything that's unsafe. [00:21:30] I've gotten over 
being nervous about saying I don't know how to do some things. As long as 
you're willing to show me how to do it, then there is no reason why I can't 
complete it or at least try it. You know what? I'm sorry. In that thinking, I was on 
a job one time. I was an MU. I was working with Stance Electric and they had a 
job at Chelsea Piers. 
[00:22:00] When the ships dock, they're hooked up to a power supply. That 
shop was responsible for all the feeders that feed a lot of those ships while 
they're docked. A lot of those disconnects were on the pier, and they ran a little 
bit of exposed pipe but it's mostly this marine cable, a heavy like ridiculously ... I 
don't know why it's so heavy cable. [00:22:30] You feed that, it goes to the ship. 
Obviously, piers are in the water. I don't swim and they had this rickety ass like a 
raft thing only big enough for one person. The journeyman thought I was going 
to get on that raft. I was like, "I don't get in the water on vacation. I'm definitely 
not getting in the water for you right now." I [00:23:00] do not swim and that 
was the Hudson River so who knows where I would have ended up if I fell off 
that. I'll don't care if you would have given me a life jacket or not. I was scared. I

was not doing it. I'll be the top guy. I was pulling that heavy ass Marine cable 
back and forth by myself, but I was not getting on that little rickety raft. Nope. 
Very good, Kenny. You opted out of the marine cable [crosstalk 00:23:30]. 
I [00:23:30] have opted out of the little rickety raft. No. Marine cable, I'll do 
that. I got you, but that raft, no. No, thank you. 
You said no raft? 
No. 
What work do you excel at or feel most comfortable doing? 
I don't know. I guess I've always liked doing large pipe. I guess maybe because 
it's one of the first big things that I worked on with a journey person. [00:24:00] 
We did a set of 15 pipes. I think it was 3-1/2-inch EMT and there was a big 
section that the tenant didn't like how it was exposed, so we demoed the pipe 
that was there. We were responsible for running it the way they wanted it 
rerouted. I got a [00:24:30] lot of practice using a table bender, using a 
protractor, and no dogs, and things like that. I guess it's kind of been a 
reoccurring thing throughout my apprenticeship and my early journeyman 
years. I guess I just got a liking for it doing the big pipe and pulling wire. 
How big is it? 
The biggest I've worked with has been 5-inch galvanized [00:25:00] so it was 
pretty big. Once you get to 4-inch [gowl 00:25:05] one stick weighs 120 pounds. 
That's a 10-foot stick. It gets heavy but a lot of people don't like it. It's a little 
harder to deal with but I enjoy; it's therapeutic. The bigger the pipe, the shorter 
the day feels. [00:25:30] Once you put up a few of those sticks of 4-inch, it's like, 
"Wow. Where did time go?" It eats time really quick. 
You usually work with a partner. 
Yes, absolutely. 
Can you describe the relationship between you and your partner when you're 
working on some of this heavier conduit runs or with this heavy equipment? 
When you're working on heavy equipment with a partner, you definitely have to 
trust each other. [00:26:00] You really can't ...not much room for bullshit 
because the heavier the equipment, the easier it is to get hurt. If you move too 
fast or if you move too slow or you're not moving together, it's very easy for a 
mistake to happen. You have to make sure you have the ability to communicate 
and I guess read the other person because at the same ... Once again working 
with heavier [00:26:30] equipment is a lot more strain on the body. If your 
Kenny Cohen

Jaime:

Jaime: 
Barrie: 
partner is not doing too good, you have to know that because if you're trying to 
lift a piece of pipe up into the air and I'm not fully up to it or he's not fully up to 
it, that could cause the other person to get hurt. Just being able to 
communicate and then trust that person that you're working with or develop a 
trust forthat person you're working with this is really important. 
When I'm thinking about what you're telling me, there's a certain type of code 
[00:27:00] language that you may use or signaling. Can you explain some of that 
type of communication? When you say communication... with that relationship, 
is there anything you recall like specifically the words you used to say to each 
other or how you used to do things? 
Only thing that's coming to mind right now is a lot of counting. 
[crosstalk 00:27:22]. 
It's like if we're getting ready to lift up a piece of pipe. I guess though the rule of 
the industry is that if you're going to lift up [00:27:30] something e ither over a 
certain amount of weight or in this example, a piece of 4-inch [gowl 00:27:35], 
there's supposed to be two men to a piece of pipe or two people, we'll bend 
down and one, two, three up and then that's the cue for everybody to lift so 
that I'm not lifting before you are maybe throwing my back out or you want to 
have an even load. There's things that... You just want to make sure that you're 
communicating the work [00:28:00] together not against each other. I think it's 
when you're rigging your stuff like that. You have the hand signals and things 
like that but... 
What's rigging? 
When you're moving heavy equipment with machines, cranes, and things like 
that. 
Okay. 
Other than that, a lot counting and just making sure you have each other's back 
when you're moving with things. 
Can you give a couple [00:28:30] of other examples since the public might get a 
chance to hear this at some point? 
Right, because when you say rigging, the person that may be listening to this 
may not know anything about [inaudible 00:28:45] electrical work. Would you 
describe something? Maybe get a little more detail so somebody who's not an 
electrician can try to understand, some can grasp some of the information. 
The thing I wanted to ask [00:29:00] you was if you could give me a couple of 
other examples when you said that we have to communicate with each other so

that don't get hurt and obviously lifting is part of it. What are some of the other 
things that come to mind right away that you could really get hurt? 
We're in the field of electricity. 
Right... 
You definitely want to be careful just in general when working with electricity 
because it's a quiet force that [00:29:30] packs a lot of power. 
With a partner when you're saying you're doing... [crosstalk 00:29:36]? 
Right. A lot of times you'll be troubleshooting circuits, making sure to find out 
maybe why a circuit may not be working. In that troubleshooting process, you 
may flash the circuits at the panel. It's important for the person [00:30:00] 
who's on the panel., and to say that their turning the power on. The person at 
the other end of it if the receptacle or whatever the end line may be, to let them 
know that they're clear before they test so that everybody knows what's going 
on. You don't want to be caught off guard that there's power being turned on 
and somebody [00:30:30] may get hurt because they don't know the power is 
coming on. 
Kenny, has somebody ever passed down a tool to you or have you ever passed 
down a tool to somebody else? 
When I first started, my dad gave me a lot of his old tools. Luckily for me, I did 
not have to buy too many tools. Actually, my first foreman was like, "You must 
have a family in the business [00:31:00] because those aren't new pliers." 
Actually, I think the pliers that my dad gave me were blown out which means 
that there was a hole in the middle of the cutting part of it. I got very good at 
using subpar tools, so when I did start getting new tools, I was aces of dynamite 
with it. Every apprentice should start over subpar tools. 
[00:31:30] I think you're just making yourself feel good the re..(all laughing) 
Yes. My sister came in a little bit later. Since there were no more used tools to 
give her, I felt it was my responsibility to buy her first set of tools. We met up in 
the city one day and I took her to one of the [00:32:00] supply houses that were 
offering the, I guess, apprentice rate for new tools, and I bought her first tool 
set. It was a special feeling to be able to give her. I guess it continued that family 
tradition sort of that we have had. I got a really cool pair of pliers from a journey 
woman at one time. [Cheryl Fowler 00:32:23] gave me a pair of, I guess, 
[00:32:30] army fatigue. I think it was for the support the troops that Klein had 
made. I don't take those to work. I got to leave them at home because I'd have 
to whoop somebody if they try to take my pliers away. I don't know. 
She handed those down to you?

Kenny: 
Yes. I think she got me and [Fox 00:32:50] a pair. 
Jaime:

Jaime: 
Kenny: 
How does that feel to receive something like that? 
It's special because the bare minimum that anyone has to do foryou [00:33:00] 
is tolerate you on the job. Anything beyond that is sort of ...that person feels 
enough for you that they're willing to offer an extra gesture towards you. That 
makes you feel special in anything whether you're inside this industry or outside 
of it. Because part of the way that we show love to each other [00:33:30] in this 
industry is either through teasing each other or passing something down or 
giving gifts. When you do receive something, it makes you feel very special 
because you know it's coming from a very special place from that person. It 
makes you appreciate a lot of things when received love from somebody else in 
this industry because they don't have to give you anything. 
Kenny, you spoke [00:34:00] a little bitabout tradition. What's yourfavorite 
Local 3 tradition? 
My favorite Local Three tradition? Aside from the passing of knowledge, I think I 
have two. The process of carding is something that I feel is a very special 
tradition. What carding is is a way to identify another Local 3 union member by 
showing each other your union [00:34:30] card. I guess is just a real fraternal 
type of gesture to me. It's like I went to college for a little bit. You would see the 
fraternities have their little special handshakes and stuff. That was their way of 
identifying each other. Masons have special ways of identifying themselves to 
each other. That process of carding I feel is a very important and special 
tradition that we [00:35:00] have there. We really need to make sure we keep 
up. 
We have the Time Warner strike going on right now. Prior to that, any Time 
Warner worker that would come to either my parents' house or now my 
apartment, I would card them. Unless they had their union card, they were not 
allowed to do any work in our home. There was one time there was a 
gentleman who showed up. He didn't have his union card on [00:35:30] him. He 
was in the union but he didn't have his card on him. He didn't understand why I 
would refuse his service. I had to explain it to him. I don't know. I'm hoping now 
maybe that they're on strike... I mean it's unfortunate they are on strike, but I'm 
hoping he understands that process of carding now, because now there are 
people who are not Local 3 that are still doing the work [00:36:00] that our 
brothers and sisters should be doing. Until they're off strike, I don't care what 
kind of the cable problems we're having, they're not coming into my house. No 
card, no work here. 
I remember one time I was working at [Two Penn 00:36:14]. Somebody asked 
me if I was Local Three. I said yes. He's like, "Let me see your union card." I was 
like, "You must not be Local 3 because you know if you want to see mine, you 
have to show me yours." He's like, "Good job," so I still don't know if he was 
Kenny Cohen

Jaime: 
Kenny: 
Local 3 or not but he didn't see [00:36:30] my union card. He didn't produce one 
so I don't know. 
Can you say a little bit more? You've already said some but maybe even more 
though about what it means to you to be a union member. 
Well, one of the things that made me appreciate carding, I was a third-year 
apprentice and I was working at the train station over Barclay. [00:37:00] We 
got our new union cards and I didn't bring mine because I wanted to make sure 
mine was always in pristine shape. I hated putting it in my wallet beca use for 
some reason our union cards are not cut to a size that fit in any standard wallet. 
Is that a formal complaint (laughing)? 
It's an unofficial complaint. I thought I was doing the right thing by leaving it at 
home and only taking it to my union meetings so I can get it scanned [00:37:30] 
so I can keep it nice and crisp. My steward came and asked to see my new union 
card. I told him I didn't have it. He broke it down to me in a way that made me 
appreciate, I guess, what unions mean to workers. He pretty much said, "Once 
you sign the back of that union card, [00:38:00] you assume the responsibility 
that you believe in the process of collective bargaining and that you are an 
advocate for the rights of workers in any industry." No one had ever broken it 
down to me like that before. You always hear carrying a union card with pride, 
but why are you carrying your union car with pride? That's the way of you of 
identifying yourself as a person who believes that all workers deserve [00:38:30] 
an opportunity or a seat at the table with their employer. 
Once I realized that, that's really what unionism stands for... I've made sure I 
always have my union card with me. Then too...it just put it a little more in to 
perspective. It really drove me home that we are advocates whether we choose 
to go union meetings or not, whether we choose to participate [00:39:00] in a 
lot of the extracurricular things. The process of being in a union by default 
makes you an advocate for workers who do not have a voice. 
Kenny, did you mention another tradition? I heard you said two. 
Yes. 
Is there something else? 
Yes. The other tradition when you progress in the industry [00:39:30] you get 
different classifications. You receive different cards. I had the opportunity 
because my father was the generation before me. He handed me my A card 
when I've completed the apprenticeship. To me, that's a very special tradition 
because it's just the way of seeing the generations within the industry. Now that 
the [00:40:00] industry is coming out of that father-son mold, seeing my friends 
receive their cards from people who mentored them in the industry and now 
Kenny Cohen 
Page 12 of 21 
Barrie: 
Kenny: 
Barrie: 
Kenny: 
Jaime: 
Kenny: 
seeing my friends give their cards to people that they've mentored is a very 
special tradition just because I feel it and continues that sense of brotherhood 
and sisterhood that I think is really important within this industry. 
[00:40:30] Can you say a little bit more about the mentoring component of the 
union? 
Mentoring has always been something that this industry has had, and I guess 
we've evolved it a little bit by creating a legit mentoring program. I came in for 
the program before there was a mentoring program, [00:41:00] but I've got tons 
of people who saw something special or something that they liked about me 
and wanted to help steer me in the right direction. I was fortunate to have that. 
Unfortunately, not everybody gets that opportunity or whether it's because 
they're not seeking it. A lot a lot of my classmates ended up in places where that 
really wasn't something [00:41:30] available to them. Now, we have this 
mentoring program where you're assigned a mentor who is a journey person in 
the industry and you're able to bounce any concerns or anything really off of 
them whether is it's about work, life, volunteering. I really think it's helping to 
welcome [00:42:00] people who aren't from the father-son mold into the 
industry. 
So it's moved away a bit from the father and son mold? 
Yes. It's like most of the people that I've interacted with in this industry so far 
especially like apprentices and people I went to the program with are first- 
generation Local 3 people. When my dad came in, most [00:42:30] of the people 
he went through the program with already had family in the business. That's a 
large time gap but you could see that there's a switch in the people that are 
becoming interested in the business and the people that are going through the 
program in order to fully welcome them in. You have to change up a little bit 
[00:43:00] how you welcome them in. Yes, I definitely think that mentoring is a 
very important component of our industry. 
Kenny, what are your aspirations as an electrician? 
My aspiration as an electrician? I don't know. It sounds very fantasy but I think 
if you're really a good electrician and a good union person, [00:43:30] you want 
to see the society get to a point where everybody's working all the time. 
Obviously, construction has ups and downs. You have periods of layoff and 
furlough and unemployment. You have times where work is booming. I think ... I 
don't know. I guess I just want to do whatever it is that is called upon me to do 
or that feels right to [00:44:00] make sure that we do our part to make sure that 
union starts to get more say within society, I guess working with people in 
general to get more say within society so that there's more work opportunity 
for everyone.

I think my goal as an electrician is to work. That's ultimately what we want to 
do. We want to feed our families. We want to live a quality lifestyle. [00:44:30] 
You do that by working hard. Whatever it is that I have to do to make sure that 
we all have that opportunities is my goal. 
If you could change something about your work, what would it be? 
If I could change something about my work ... I don't [00:45:00] know. That's a 
curve ball question. I had to think about that. It's a curve ball. 
For me, I like to wake up a little bit later. Just saying, I don't like waking up early. 
Yes, that.... 
I'm getting used to it, I guess but... 
I don't think I'm ever going to get used to waking up early but... I remember 
watching my dad wake up every single morning. 
[00:45:30] What time? 
He was always early to work, so I know he would ... I'm like that person that's 
right on time where it's like ... I know guys who get in to the [shanty 00:45:43] 
six o'clock and we don't start working until seven. That means they missed out 
on a whole lot sleep. I'm that guy ... 
[crosstalk 00:45:52] 
A lot of people get into their routine. It's like that's the guy who wants to go get 
his coffee. He brings his breakfast. He has his paper. [00:46:00] He wants to sit 
there and flip through it and read it. He wants to be comfortable before he 
starts working which is cool. Maybe when I get old, I want to do that too. I still 
stay up late and watch TV. I still go out from time to time. As long as I'm there 
15 minutes before seven, actually my goal is to get there by quarter to seven. If I 
do that, then I'm completely fine with that. [00:46:30] If I could change 
something ... 
Think about it. If anything comes up, you could throw it at us. Have you ever 
been complimented at work about somethingthat you did on the job or did any 
work that felt particularly meaningful? 
I think that's every day. It's like I think we should all... Every component of the 
jobs that we do has a purpose. It's like I learned that as an apprentice just 
[00:47:00] because you're organizing material or you're getting coffee, it doesn't 
mean that's an insignificant job. If you ask the right questions, you're going to 
find out what the purpose of that job is and why it's important to the grand 
scheme of the project that you all are working on. Anything that I complete, I 
Page 14 of 21 
Jaime: 
Kenny: 
Barrie: 
Kenny: 
Jaime: 
Kenny: 
feel is special. [00:47:30] Last time I did some pipe work, I got complimented on 
it which was extra special because I was refreshing myself and teaching myself 
new things as I went along. It was good to receive those compliments. 
Unfortunately, I recently got laid off from Wade. In the process of talking to my 
foreman, he let me know that everything I worked on turned on nicely. There 
were no errors or flaws [00:48:00] in what I did. It was good to know that part of 
me is going to forever be in that building. Nobody had to do any changes to it so 
that's all me. That's me right there. That was a good feeling. 
It's pretty neat right there when you're saying as you go through the city, you're 
leaving parts of you. 
Yes. There used [00:48:30] to be a tradition where journeymen will write their 
name on whether it's a pipe run or may be in a panel that they laced in, they'd 
leave their signature or their marks somewhere on a piece of work that they 
did. My boy Mark who I was working with at this last shop, he did some 
beautiful panels. He shaped them in, put all the braided circuits in, and 
everything was beautiful. He signed his name and all of the ones that he 
completed. [00:49:00] His work in itself was him leaving a piece but he signed it 
as well just in case anybody else wanted to admire it too. They knew who did 
that. They knew Mark was there. 
That's cool. 
I don't think I've ever signed anything but maybe I'll start. 
In the future, do you think that your children or members of your community 
are going to want to do the same kind of [00:49:30] work or will be doing the 
same kind of work? 
I hope so. I do think one of the great things about this business is the ability to 
pass it on to the next generation within your family. Obviously, I think it's great 
to have all a whole lot of people that are new to this industry coming in because 
hopefully, it creates an opportunity for them to start a family tradition. I don't 
[00:50:00] know. I guess maybe I feel like I appreciate it a little bit more because 
I am familiar with it from my childhood. I hope that some of the younger 
generations of my family aspire to go into this business. I hope that me, my 
sister, and my father do a good job of expressing how great of an opportunity 
[00:50:30] this is. I do hope that members of my community are able to take 
advantage of this. 
One of the things that I feel isn't spoken about enough in schools is the 
opportunity to join apprentice programs. I got sucked inside a trap where you 
have to go to college in order to have a good career, make a lot of money. I 
went to St. John's and I was like $15,000 [00:51:00] in debt off of two semesters. 
All those dudes I was hanging out with that were saying " you don't want to be 
an electrician" now have like 100 grand in debt are asking me how did I get into 
Kenny Cohen

Kenny: 
Local 3 now. It's like I might be $15,000 richer had I not listened to them back 
them and came in a little earlier. Who knows? 
It is a path that is more available than [00:51:30] people know? 
I don't know if it's more available than people know but not enough people 
know that it's available, I feel. Because even if you know about it and you know 
to apply, it's still a competitive application process. I think we get something like 
10,000 applicants and we may be only accept like a few thousand people into 
the program through each application wave so it's competitive. It's as 
competitive as [00:52:00] getting into some of these top schools. It's not like 
we're taking a whole bunch of slackers or anything like that. At the same time, 
there are a lot of students who may love this industry if they knew that it 
existed like the opportunity was ... 
Tons of people go to school for engineering, but how many engineering jobs are 
really out there for people? [00:52:30] Some of those people who go to school 
for engineering realized, "Damn, I like the hands-on aspect of assembling and 
putting together this work more than the actual part of the engineering, but 
where was that option for me when I was in high school?" I think it's important 
that we look into how to bring back trade schools and things like that that one 
give [00:53:00] more men and women the foundational skills of it but then also 
let them know that their careers in construction and in the trades can give them 
a good lifestyle as an adult and allow them to support themselves. 
Do you think electricians are paid fairly or overpaid or underpaid? 
I don't know think anybody ever want less money. I'm [00:53:30] definitely not 
complaining with what we make. I feel like I'm very fortunate. I think I started 
feeling fortunate as a fourth-year apprentice. 
That's your transfer to fortunate lifestyle? 
Yes. That was my tra nsfer to fortunate lifestyle. 
Prior to that? 
Prior to that? It's rough throughout. It's like I really give a [00:54:00] lot of credit 
to a lot of the brothers and sisters who go through the a pprenticeship who have 
left other jobs, who have families already, who may have mortgages already 
because I was single. No kids living at my parents' house, didn't have to pay 
rent. I think I only have my phone bill and maybe half of my car insurance, and I 
was still struggling to make ends meet for my circumstance, [00:54:30] yet there 
were people who were goingthrough the program with a lot more responsibility 
than me that saw the finish line, and that was their motivation to make it work 
until then. Maybe it makes them a stronger person at the end. Maybe they 
appreciate it in a different way than I do at the end. I definitely always

respected my brothers and sisters who had [00:55:00] a lot more responsibility 
than me going through the program. 
Kenny, what advice would you give someone starting out in your field? I ask this 
question now because I know your sister is just starting out. It's a special 
situation because she's your sister. I did have the opportunity to interview her 
already. She did tell me a story about you and her going to Home Depot. Would 
you elaborate a little bit [00:55:30] this happening? What happened? 
My sister was like me in the sense that she had no prior experience in this field 
and different from me; she's a woman. I already know some of the stigmas that 
still linger within the industry when it comes to women [00:56:00] on the 
worksite. I wanted to just prepare her as best as I could for what she may 
encounter on the job. 
We did a little field trip one day. It was me, Courtney, and my dad, and we went 
to Home Depot. We walked up and down the electrical aisle looked at all the 
different... 
Fittings. 
Fittings. I'm trying to list... material. We just kind of ... This is a 4-inch [00:56:30] 
box, this is a 5-inch box, these are raised plates, these are wire molds, this is 
conduit, these are couplings, these are connectors, just different things so she 
had some sort of idea of what she was getting into. I wanted to make sure she 
understood the physical aspect of it as well. We walked over to the EMT section 
where all the kindorf and everything was. We had a little exercise where she 
had [00:57:00] to pick up a bundle of three-quarter and 1-inch EMT. I think a 
bundle of 1-inch EMT is the heaviest bundle that we deal with. I figured if she 
could carry that out a few feet, pick it up, put it down, she'd be all right. She did 
well. I'm a very proud of her. 
Every time I see people that she works with, they always speak highly of her. 
[00:57:30] She already has great stories about work, and she seems to be 
enjoying. She's got her little apprentice posse that they always hang out with 
her. One of her classmates came to my house the other day. We had a nice little 
beverage. She seems to be coming into to it well. She's one of those people 
that I admire because she's got two kids. Luckily, she's still living at home with 
parents. She's making more money. Before, she got [00:58:00] not much. She'll 
surpass that in her apprenticeship, but it's hard to go backwards to go forward 
again. She saw that end goal and knew that it was the best opportunity for her 
and her family. I'm hoping that she sees that all those passions that she had 
before entering the business, she can still pursue as well while still having 
[00:58:30] a great career. 
Are we comingto [inaudible]? 
Kenny Cohen 
Page 17 of 21 
Jaime: 
Kenny: 
Jaime: 
Kenny: 
I have one more question for you, Kenny. Actually, two more questions. You 
speak about your father as this role model as a son where he went through this 
career being there for you. How was that relationship affected your career or 
what kind of [00:59:00] influence has it had on your career? 
I guess my parents both, they were ... We were a family. We always did 
everything together. My parents are always very active in the community. There 
was a point where my dad was pretty active volunteering within the union. I 
guess all those things have just been something that they never hid from us. 
They made us a part of it. We used to hang out up at the joint board all the 
[00:59:30] time. I remember my dad taught the asbestos class. All class nights. I 
remember our dinner was a butter rolls because they used to have butter rolls 
and danishes and things like that, little pastries for, I guess, the people who 
participated in class. We'd have our little butter rolls and we'd hangout out 
there and run around the hallways while he was teaching class. 
[01:00:00] We always were at the Labor Day parades and things like that. I guess 
coming into it our dad ran work. He was a foreman. Everybody that I've come 
across has always spoken highly about the type of union man he was, the type 
of worker he was. I feel like if I don't try my best to do the most that [01:00:30] I 
can, then that's disrespectful to what he left for me. 
I think there was one time like a not so tasteful joke around somebody who 
knew my dad and it's like I thought I was going to get a bunch of laughs, and the 
dude looked at me is like, "I don't think your dad would like that." I guess that's 
just kind of what... That's the regard that people that I [01:01:00] come across 
hold my dad in. It's like you have to ... It used to be a lot of pressure but it's ... 
You want to be able to do that to honor your parents. Your parents work hard 
so that you can be better than them. That's my responsibility to work as hard as 
possible to do that for them. 
Kenny, I have one more [01:01:30] question for you what inspires you? 
The world inspires me. It's like a cliche answer almost, right? It's hard to be 
uninspired especially today because it's like there's so much going on, and it 
seems like there's so much stagnation and everything. People fight so hard. I 
used to be very into the civil rights movement. That's a long history of people 
working [01:02:00] really hard for something to still be denied opportunities. 
You still see that today in civil rights. You see that in education. You see that in 
politics. 
Recently, I've been listening to the Logic album. He has a new album now called 
Everybody and it's really good. I recommend it to listen. One of his monologues, 
he pretty much says that [01:02:30] you have to do what makes you happy. For 
everybody, that's going to be a little bit different. What's always made me 
happy is helping other people and giving whatever I can to make sure that 
there's a little bit more equality in the world. It sucks that we live in a society 
where [01:03:00] everyone does not have equal access and opportunity to be 
Kenny Cohen 
Page 18 of 21 
successful or to be whatever it is that they would like to be. As long as you 
continue to see those signs in the world, you have to continue to do whatever it 
is that you feel you can do to bring people together or create a little bit more 
harmony within the world. 
[01:03:30] The opportunity to continue to work towards that is kind of what 
inspires me really to do whatever I can. The better electrician I am hopefully, 
that means the more opportunities that there will be for other people like me to 
be able to come into this business and create their own opportunities and 
create opportunities for other people like them. 
Barrie: That's a beautiful place to stop but I still want to ask [01:04:00] you one 
more[crosstalk 01:04:00]. Think about this as a time capsule, somebody might 
come upon this 20 years from now, so anything else you think you'd want to say 
about your job, the union, this [01:04:30] experience if somebody might look at 
years from now. 
Kenny: I guess if you're given the opportunity to do something like never say no 
whether it's in this industry whatever industry you may end up getting into or 
just life. It's like my experience at Local 3 has been a little different than a lot of 
my peers just because I never [01:05:00] say no. Me and Jamie work together at 
Citi Field. I just happen to be somewhere and somebody asked me if I wanted 
something that sounded different, I said, "Yes, why not?" I didn't know what it 
was going to be but it didn't matter. I just never said no. 
A lot of people laugh at the person when the teacher says, "Can I get a 
volunteer?" and somebody raises their hand and everybody is laughing. "You 
don't even know what [01:05:30] it was," but it doesn't matter. The person 
who's guiding your class or the people who are guiding our industry, if you get 
an opportunity that's good, bad, different, whatever it is, you don't know what 
it will be and how it may alter your mind a little bit if you say no and you close 
yourself off to that opportunity. 
Sometimes [01:06:00] I feel as a minority, if you say no, there's no guarantee 
that another person like you will have the opportunity to do it. It's important for 
us to continue to say yes as much as possible so that we can do as well as we 
can and break some of those old stigmas a nd hopefully create that opportunity 
once again for other people so just always say yes, always say yes. 
Jaime: Kenny, we have one [01:06:30] question that you didn't answer. You just 
skipped over it. 
Kenny: What would I change? 
Jaime: I want to rephrase that question to see if will give you a different perspective on 
it. Is there something in our industry that is changing that you don't want to see 
it change or you would like to stop it from changing? 
Kenny Cohen 
Page 19 of 21 
Barrie: 
Or vice versa. It's changing and you like it. 
Jaime: 
Kenny: 
Jaime: 
Barrie: 
Jaime: 
Kenny: 
Jaime 
Kenny: 
Or, yes, thank you, [Barrie01:07:00] [01:07:00] or it's changing and you like the 
change. 
Now that we brought up the issue of diversity, that's definitely something that's 
changing and I think that's continuously changing, societies continuously slowly 
becoming more open to groups of people. We are fortunate to be in Local 3 
which has always had a progressive mindset [01:07:30] not just progressive but 
also proactive. 
Fortunately, for me have I've had the opportunity to interact with people from 
other locals within our union and a lot of them are still dealing with issues that 
we've already either worked out or have been working to fix within Local 3, the 
issues with women, issues [01:08:00] with minorities so people of color issues, 
even with the LGBTQ community. Those are things that we've already 
addressed. I guess our membership knows where we stand on it and we're 
continuously opening up that dialogue. It makes you proud to be a part of an 
organization like that. It's like the stories my father used to share are nothing 
like the experiences that I'm having. [01:08:30] It feels good to know that there 
has been progression within our industry in that short amount of time. 
Unfortunately, there are always people that aren't happy with the way things 
go, but I always believe in patience. A lot of things that happened in this country 
didn't happen [01:09:00] overnight. It took a long time, a lot of fighting, a lot of 
struggling for it to happen. For us to expect anything different in our industry is 
unrealistic. As long as everybody is doing their part to make sure that change 
continues to make us better, then we're going to keep going into the right 
direction. People who are against that change or whatever it is [01:09:30] that... 
They're eventually going to be unhappy people because it's inevitable. It's going 
to happen. I'm happy to be a part of an organization like this one where.... we 
have leadership that recognizes. We have to change with the world. 
Thank you, Kenny. I don't have anything. 
Thank you. 
Is there you want to add or anything that we missed or you want to ask us? 
Another curve ball. 
[01:10:00] No. Just think closing like if there's anything that was on your mind 
that you wanted to speak about or that we didn't bring attention to or anything 
like that. 
Nothing. I'm just happy to have had the opportunity to participate in this. I think 
it's amazing that you guys are documenting the accounts of working people

within [01:10:30] this industry. It's important that our stories are told because 
they're often not. Most the people that don't know about this industry, it's like 
they may be going through something similar in whatever it is that they're doing 
or the things that may inspire us may also inspire them. Hopefully, they can 
[01:11:00] identify with us and identify with other working people, so that it just 
brings us more together. 
Thanks. 
Awesome job, Kenny. 
Yes. 
Hopefully, we can get Pops to come in and hang out. 
Yes. 
I'm going to shut this thing off.
