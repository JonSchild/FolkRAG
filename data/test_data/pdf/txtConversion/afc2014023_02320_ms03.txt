Ahmed briefly discusses the need for halal products for 
Muslim LSU students and how he and his father would 
go to Sanderson Farms to slaughter chickens. 
 
3:55 
Most of the early customer base (of the 80s) from 
Malaysia has dwindled because there are less 
Malaysian students coming to study at LSU. Now, many 
of his customers are African and Indian students at 
LSU. He has shifted the type of products he sells in his 
store to support the changing demographic of LSU 
students over the years. 
 
5:04 
Ahmed says that he sees a lot of foreign families now at 
his store as Baton Rouge gets bigger and the 
population changes. Some of his customers are also 
local families who have lived abroad (mostly those who 
have worked in the oil industry). 
 
6:47 
Ahmed talks about the people of different nationalities 
who shop at his store (Indian, Turkish and Bulgarian, for 
example) and how the products offered change with the 
population of Baton Rouge. Ahmed: “We are in this 
business a long time, so we have resources where we 
can get those food items.”

from: New York, Chicago, California, Houston
