'NOTE:
 ES82-196949-1  is presumedly Lithuanian,  as ES82-196949-2  is also
 
Lithuanian,  and E582-196949-3 is Ethiopian,  both of which were taken by
 
Carl Fleischhauer as the photographer,  and Elena Bradunas as the
 
fieldworker.
 The photos could also possibly be Latvian due to the
 
design on the pulpit,  but fieldworker Ri ardas Vidutis was thorough with
 
his logsheets,  so it is not likely to be his photographs.
 In that the
 
Lithuanian classes were presumedly held at the Latvian Lutheran Church
 
in Rockville,  Maryland,  that would account for the design on the pulpit.
 
PLUS: Photocopy of memos regarding "No slides" and "Missing Logs."
