Dear Bess,
 
Some m ont hs  back I was able to borrow a print of the
 
old March of Time movie on Ledbelly and Danny made
 
some still photographs from it.
 Sis transcribed
 
the soundtrack and I thought that you might be
 
interested in a carbon of both.
 The movie has
 
very bitter memories for Martha and she wishes,
 
of course,  that it would be buried and forgotten
 
but I' m keeping a hold of it on my shelf just as
 
part of history,  for good or bad.
 
With best wishes to all the family,
 
Peter Seeger

Leadbelly Letter
 
P.O.  Box 6679
 
Ithaca,  New York
 14851
 
Dear Mr.  Killean:
 
Please stop sending me the Leadbelly Letter.  I appreciate
 
your courtesy in doing so over the years,  but the current
 
interview with Lonnie Donnegan has convinced me that your
 
editorial position is to print whatever anyone wants to say
 
without any attempt at verification or even a suggestion to
 
Lhe  Leader  that  the information has not been varified.  I do
 
not think yours is a responsible publication,
./and therefore
 
choose not to have it in my home.
 
I will be 75 in two months,  my brother Alan is 80,  my father
 
has been dead for almost 50 years.  I will not be baited into
 
spending the productive time I have left defending the Lomax
 
family reputation against any remark anyone happens to make
 
and you happen to print.  If you choose to present my father
 
and brother as dishonorable self-serving exploiters of the
 
great singers of their day,  there is nothing I can do to
 
prevent you.
 
But  I don't have to read it.
 
Very truly,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
P.S.  I continue to wonder why you do not spend at  least some
 
portion of the money and time you seem to have in abundance
 
in trying to help some of the blues men and women of today
 
many of whom could certainly use your writing skills,  your
 
research abilities and your indefatigability.  The dead are
 
less demanding,  I suppose.

Dear Ms.  Killeen,
 
Than'k you for sending along the letter I wrote Huddle
 
Ledbetter in 1943.  Where on earth did you get it?
 
I do not have any idea how you might trace the matter
 
further;  I no longer remember how or even if Huddie replied
 
to my letter nor if any of his recordings were sent to
 
Australia.  If they were,  it is unlikely that they still
 
survive unless somebody simply walked away with them or
 
perhaps turned them over to the US Embassy.  All OWl offices
 
were closed down at the end of the war,  I believe.  There
 
might be some record of the transaction,  if it occurred,  at
 
the Library of Congress;  you could drop Joe Hickerson a note
 
at the Folk Archive.  In any case,  even if you could follow
 
this through successfully,  all you would have found out is
 
that some of his recorded performances from the LC archives
 
got to Australia and I don't know just what that would mean.
 
I find myself almost bemused by your publication,  wondering
 
how so much energy and interest can be channelled into such
 
generally unpromising soil.  Certainly Huddie Leadbetter was a
 
thoroughly remarkable human being, but  I very much doubt that
 
there is much more of importance to be found out concerning
 
him.  He was a very private person,  to the best of my
 
recollection,  and did not  leave a plain track.  And then I
 
look at the many fine blues artists struggling to survive
 
today and wonder if anyone will ever try to work with them
 
and memorialize them as my brother and father and Pete Seeger
 
and Moses Asch and now you have done for Leadbelly. Well,  we
 
all do what grabs hold of our imaginations,  I suppose,  and we
 
must do it as well as we can for our times.
 
Sincerely,
 
(
