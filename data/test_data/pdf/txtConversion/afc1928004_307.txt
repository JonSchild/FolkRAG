BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 
F 
HARRY MONTAGUE 
" 
The Artist CiYmigve of the doy." 
HARRY MONTAGUE was born in Philadelphia September 14th, 
1850, and made his first appearance as a 
vocalist in the fall of 
1872, at one of the western theatres, appearing for the balance 
of the season with much success throughout the south and west. 
Early in 1873 he determined to go to England; he spent several 
months in London and had the advantage of hearing all th:. 
great English comic and character singers, in the meantime, 
studying hard and improving greatly by what he had seen. 
Flo 
then visited and appeared with great success in the principal 
cities of England, Ireland and Scotland, thence to the Cape of 
Good Hope, thence to Sydney, Melbourne and the principal 
towns of Australia, where he made a 
tremendous hit. 
From 
Australia be went to New Zealand, thence to Honolulu, ( Ha-
waian Islands), thence to San Francisco and overland to New 
York City. 
A 
trip unparalleled in its length and success by 
any other Comic Vocalist in tho world. 
Mr. Mo-grauun arrived in New York last October ( 18750 and 
immediately leaped into a 
popularity which has steadily increas-
ed during the past eit.tlit months he has played here, and he is 
now recognized as the Artiste Comique par excelleve of the 
present day. 
We have :lad the pleasure of listening to all the sono-s 
com-
prised in his extensive repertoire, and it is no wonder that he 
is nighly the recipient f 
what might be justly termed a 
pP?fert 
oration, for when we come to take into consideration the pe-
culiar grace and elegance which characterize his " business," 
as well as the taking, vivacious character of his extensive re-
-
)ertaire of songs, and the clearness with which he articulates 
his words, it is not surprising that he has established himself a 
great metropolitan favorite, for, without doubt, his manner is 
most elegant and original, and his songs are among the most 
captivating of any now before the public. 
As a 
result of the flattering success which has attended his 
efforts in this city, he has been re-engaged until further notice 
by Tony Pastor, and will appear every night during the Cen-
tennial spring and summer at Tony Pastor's Theatre on Broad-
way.

I 
met a 
fair charmer a 
few weeks ago 
In a 
Madison Avenue stage, 
Her style and her figure it pleased me you know 
She was just about the right age. 
As we were alone, I 
suggested to her 
In terms quite polite and refined, 
That I'd be most happy to see her safe home. 
She said yes, if you'll be so kind. 
SPOKEN.—SO 
I 
took the young lady to her home, she invited 
me in. and I 
spent a very pleasant evening, and just before I 
left 
CHORUS. 
I 
tickled her under the chin 
Repeat—I 
tickled again and again 
Sill did no, say no, she liked it you know 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
I 
called by appointment to see her next day, 
And asked her if she'd take a drive, 
She said I'm delighted, that's just what I 
want 
And in a 
moment was close by my side. 
Now driving you know, matt-- your appetite keen 
So when we trot bacii, to Deimonico's we went, 
And I 
ordered some oysters nJ vriae. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we had a delightful supper together, at 
after supper when the wine commenced to make her crice:cs 
rev, I 
reached across the table, and 
Tickled her under ";iie

Now I 
see her quite often, and you wont be surprised 
That our friendship ripened so fast, 
For I 
found that in her, I 
really had met. 
dear, darling creature at last, 
And our love grows stronger. day after day 
We're going to be married next June, 
And it all came about, through that queer little way, 
That I 
tickled her under the chin. 
SeoKEN.—So last night when she bid me good bye, it the 
front door, she said Chancy, you dear good fellow. ill never for-
t 
get the first time that you— 
Tickled me under the chin, 
That you tickled me under the chin. 
1 
didn't say no, for I 
liked it you know, 
When you tickled me under the chin. 
When I 
tickle her under the chin. 
I 
tickled again am! again, 
She did not say no, for she liked it you know,„ 
When J 
tickled her under the chin. 
SPOKEN.—This is the moral of the story: 
You all have a 
chance for adventures like this, 
With the charming young ladies you meet, 
And you'll find on an average that five out of ten 
Won't object to a 
drive and a 
treat; 
But pray let me give you one piece of advice. 
When a 
girl's loving kiss you would win, 
.Tust do it quite gently and don't he too rough. 
When you tickle her under the chin. 
CHORUS. 
When you tickle her under the chin. 
Repeat—When you tickle her under the chin. 
Just do it quite gently and don't be too rough, 
When you tickle her under the chin.

KEEP OFF THE GRASS. 
(Copyright.) 
Words by W ILLIAM DEVERE. MUSIC 
by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
Sung with great success by HARRY MONTAGUE, at Tony Pastor's 
Theatre, New York. 
I 
ENTERED the Park on a 
beautiful evening, 
To bask in the pleasures that nature had strewn, 
With a 
bounteous hand for the rich and the poor man, 
Where flowers nestle closely -in verdure's full bloom. 
A 
policetnan was there, and I 
asked his permissit. n 
To wander around through the Park with the mass 
Of the people, he answered yes, walk at your leisure, 
But be careful young man, and keep off the grass. 
Cnoaus. 
Keep off the grass, keep off the grass ; 
Mind what I 
tell you, if I 
let you pass— 
Keep off the grass, keep off the grass , 
I'll bid you good evening, but keep off the grass. 
Now I 
hadn't gone far when I 
met a 
fair charmer— 
A 
beautiful, gushing, dear little maid. 
I 
raised my chapeau, and addressed her quite blandly, 
And asked her if with me she'd 1,romenade. 
She smiled and looked sweet when I 
asked her this question, 
If strolling with me half an hour she would pass, 
So sweetly she answered, " Yes, sir, with pleasure, 
I'll stroll by your side if you keep off the grass " 
Keep IT the grass, &c. 
Soon after we were married, and quickly I 
found out 
That I 
had caught a 
tartar, you bet, 
Although in some things I 
do think she's perfection, 
Yet I 
often do wish that we never had met. 
Last week I 
saw that policeman one morning, 
And 
told him of my troubles since wedding this lass, 
But he laughed at me, when he repeated his warning, 
" 
I 
told you, young fellow, to keep off the grass." 
SPOKEN. — Now, boys, take my advice, whenever you are 
strolling in the Park, and get up a nice little flirtation with a 
pretty girl. 
Just take my advice, and— 
Keep off the grass, kc.

IT'S EXCEEDINGLY AWKWARD FOR ME, 
(Copyright.) 
Written and composed by HARRY MONTAGUE, and sung by 
him with the greatest success at Tony Pastor's Theatre, New 
York. 
SOME people do say, if you marry in haste 
At leisure your sure to repent. 
I 
assure you of such things I've had quite a 
taste 
And I 
certainly to it assent. 
Now, the wrong girl I 
happened to marry one day 
However strange that seems to be, 
But they both love me still, and that makes it you know 
Exceedingly awkward for me. 
CHORUS. 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, 
Very awkward for me. 
I 
love both these girls, 
I 
do, 'poll my word— 
It's exceedingly awkward for me. 
Now, one of them was a 
most beautiful blonde, 
The other a 
lovely brimettee, 
And both of them seemed of me very fond, 
And the sact is they seem to be yet. 
Now which of the two did love me the best. 
Seemed the greatest of mysteries to be, 
While I 
loved them both, and that made it you know 
Exceedingly awkward for me. 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, & c. 
I 
at last married one, and from that very day 
I 
date all my trouble and woe, 
For when we went out, these two always would meet 
No matter wherever we'd go, 
11 
And they both would glare at each other, for each 
Was as jealous as jealous could be, 
And w..en we'd get home my wife would make it 
Exceedingly awkward for me. 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, dre. 
Now, which of the tweally loved me the best, 
I 
determined at last should be found, 
So a 
friend of mine went to them both, with this yarn, 
And told them that I 
had been drowned; 
Of course Was a 
job that we both did arrange. 
And I 
know that you all will agree, 
For had I 
really been drowned, 'twould have been strange 
And exceedingly awkward for me. 
its exceedingly awkward for me, Ltc. 
When my wife heard the news she exclaimet., 
Oh, my! 
Are you sure he will never come back; 
I 
feel very sorry, I'm sure I 
could cry, 
For I 
look like a 
fright dressed in black; 
And then I'll be kept in the house for a 
year 
And no company be able to see; 
How mean to die now for I've just bought some new clothes 
Oh, it's exceedingly awkward for me." 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, JEc. 
Now, when the maiden whom I 
should have wed heard the 
news, 
She cried, and did bitterly weep, 
And said that she wished that she was dead so that she 
In the grave with her darling might sleep. 
I 
well knew them who loved me the best, 
And wished I 
unmarried might be; 
But I'm tied all my life to an unloving wife, 
Which is exceedingly awkward for me. 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, 014.

• 
I 
make it a 
rule as I 
jog on through life, 
To look on the bright side of things, 
For what little pleasure I've had in my day, 
Has rather too soon taken wings ; 
As fretting and care cannot help us on much 
I 
strive its gloom to disperse, 
So let come what may, let us laughingly say, 
It's bad, but it might have been worse. 
When an innocent youth, with my head full of love 
For a 
girl who had sworn to me wed, 
You may guess my dismay, when I 
found cut one day, 
That she'd married another instead. 
Yes, she married a 
drunkard, and a 
wife beater too, 
And her Ale with him now is a 
curgt 
Though she jilted me cruel, T 
think 1 
cali ay, 
It was bad, but t 
might have welt worse. 
There are some men I've seen Who have eonctantly been 
Endeavoring to stir up much strife, 
By persuading their fellow-men never to be 
Satisfied with their station in life 
They say " go on strike, and you'll 2:et what you like," 
And to order and peace seem averred; 
18 
Now, if they'd come to me, I'd tell them you see, 
" 
Things are bad, but you've made them worse."' 
Now e'er I 
retire I'd like to inspire, 
A 
feeling of gayety here ; 
Then a 
fig for ad trouble neer care for to- morrow, 
Nor for what it may bring, have no fear, 
Though the clouds are in sight, it will one day be bright, 
Now when you remember my verse, 
When I 
go away, I 
hope you won't say, 
He was had, but he might have been worse.

close to me, and whispered— 
Pull down the blind, Sze

change, to the theatre we went. 
And when we got home she was very content. 
Sho saw them make love, and so learned the way. 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte." and stilted her fine : 
She called me her rose-bud. her duck and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear: 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
Spoken.—Yes, I 
popped the qnestion to her right then and 
there, and do you know at that highly interesting moment, just 
as I 
asked this fair creature to marry me, there was a 
police-
man went past, se she drew up a 
little closer, and put her dear 
arms around in,y neck, and looked up into my face with all her 
innocent simplicity, and simpered out, " Well Charley, if I

Hit the Right Nail on the Head.

How many people pass their lives 
In poverty and woe, 
They try their best but never hal 
The proper road to go. 
A jack of all trades is of none 
A master it is said, 
He does not know the way to bit 
The right nail on the nead.

There's room enough for all 
I've often heard it said, 
If we can find the way to hit 
The right nail on the head. 
We start in life, we may compare 
To four cross roads that lead 
In different ways, but which to choose 
Is difficult indeed. 
Our judgment must be sign-post, and 
When that is wrong we're led 
Through crooked paths, and fail to hit 
The right nail on the head. 
There's room enough for all, ,tc. 
In courtship we should careful be, 
And pause upon the brinli

For coniMip iA a

That easily will sink. 
Though matrimony's very nice. 
Pray think before you wed. 
Or you may find too late you've hit 
The wrong nail on the head. 
There's room enough for all, 
hough luck may seem against us, if 
We only play with care 
The game of life, some winning cards 
Will fall unto our share. 
Don't throw the game up in despair, 
But try again instead 
With hearty will, and you mu•st. hit

Twas in the pleasant summer time 
I

The robbins sang their sweetest rhyme 
And loving was their glance, 
We wandered midst the blooming flowers, 
He called me sweet and fair, 
The queen of all the sunny brows, 
The brightest rosebud there. 
SPOKEN.— Oh he was such a charming, such a 
delightful 
young fellow that I 
never can forget— 
CHORUS. 
When we met there by the river 
In the sunlight's merry glow, 
For my heart he won forever 
Down where the water lilies grow. 
He whispered words of fond delight, 
The birds they listened too, 
We wandered till the stall_ at night 
Shone out in sky sc ; 
When arm in arm wc wandered on 
Way down that lezty lane, 
He said 
never roam again, 
But we soon again.

WALKING OUT ON SUNDAY,

Walking out on Sunday I 
think very nice 
What I 
would dispense with. not at any price; 
So when the weather's proper. Inm ready in a 
thricc 
To take my usual walk out on Sunday. 
A 
drive out in a " trap - now some folks seem to prize. 
But the exercise of walking I 
would much advise, 
And oh. such funny sights. and elm such horrid guys 
You meet with when ytnfre walkin,r out on Sunday. 
enonus. 
Walkim, out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Crawling out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
:Driving out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Its awful jolly walking out on Sunday. 
Now there's Augustus Tompkins a 
very heavy swell, 
He manages to live somewhere on Murray Hill. 
You'd take him for a 
banker or a 
broker down on Wall street 
When he crawls out to do his walk on Sunday. 
With his silver- headed cane, and a 
glass stuck in one eye , 
He twirls his fine moustache. which suspicious looks oi dye, 
In fact you seldom see. se elegant a 
guy, 
As Tompkins when he's crawling out on Sunday.

If I 
only had my way, 
En this bright land of ours, 
There's many t 
iwrs I'd like to do, 
If I 
only had the power— 
I'd have no care or grief 
To worry us each day, 
I'd make all folks contented, 
If I 
only had my way. 
Our laws should be the same 
For the rich man and the poor, 
Our banks and institutions 
Should be solid to the core, 
And as regards our navy, 
To the government I 
would say, 
Don't send any damaged ships to sea, 
If I 
only had my way. 
If I 
only had my way, 
If I 
only had my way, 
Eight hours should be a 
fair day's work 
And bosscs they should pay 
Liberal wrro-es to all, 
Now this I 
think you'll say 
Is the very best thing that I 
could do 
If I 
only had my way. 
Street improvements I 
would make 
And railroads I'd complete, 
I'd lower the price of coal, 
And everything we eat s 
And to those who had great wealth, 
To them I 
now won] I 
sly, 
Just you share that with the poor man, 
If I 
only had my way. 
If I 
only had my way, 
if I

All you batchelors should be married 
And that without delay, 
And for all you girls I'd find 
A 
husband true and kind, 
And I'd marry all the old maids 
To some sharp and gay young sports. 
If I 
only hat.. my way, 
To marrieo folks I'd say, 
Now live in peace and happiness, 
Each year, each nrintli, each day, 
And never let trouble come 
To leati man and wife astray, 
I'd close up all divorce courts 
If I 
only had my way. 
If I 
only had my way, 
Our manager h should call 
For champagne, brandy, wine, cigars, 
Enough to treat you all, 
And the leader of our band, 
A 
jolly gooL , eilow is he, 
We'll all go over to 12oston 
And have a 
jolly spree. 
And now I'll say good night, 
If you nke my little rhymes 
Pray let your Rind. applause 
Upon my efforts snipe, 
For the more applause I 
get, 
The more money to me they pay ; 
I'd sing you a

The Less I 
Say of It, the Better. 
Written and Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Wonderful how we do it, but we do." 
New songs will come around. 
As new subjects they abound, 
And the one I've, got, I 
think is just the cheese too, 
And if it makes a 
hit, 
Why then, I 
don't care a 
bit, 
For my object is for to sing and to please you. 
It's a 
saying by the way, 
That you hear every day, 
And sometimes you read it in a 
letter ; 
So with no more preface, 
I 
will introduce my case— 
For, I 
think the less I 
say of it, the better. 
A 
young man in the street, 
A 
pretty girl does meet, 
And introduces himself by sweet talking; 
She thinks he is so nice, 
For he talks as smooth as ice 
To her, as along the street they're walking; 
And not long after that, 
She's got on a 
new hat, 
And way up-town we find that he has met her; 
And when it does get dark, 
They walk into the Park— 
Well, I 
think the less I 
say of it the better. 
I've been idle just a 
year, 
And I'm feeling rather queer, 
As to where I'm going for to raise some money; 
For it's true, upon my life, 
Ic'e got a 
darling wife, 
And she can't lice very long on love and honey; 
But there's one thing so fine,, 
We've no children so divine, 
So poverty it don't seem such a 
fetter. 
But on this you may rely, 
- 
There will come some by-and-bye-
-1Vell, I 
think the less t 
say of it the better.

MY LOVE SHE IS A 
FAIRY QUEEN 
Sung by Miss ALICIA JOURDAN. 
Nly love she is a 
fairy queen— 
About her face no paint is seen; 
Her pretty foot is very small, 
But very large is her waterfall ; 
Her ankle, too, so plump and fat, 
It makes my heart go pit-a-pat; 
Were I 
a 
bee upon her lip, 
I'd stay all day and sip, and sip. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she never flirts—she's no coquette; 
She never scolds, nor does she fret ; 
She's some on style, and full of fun ; 
" 
You bet your life," she's number one. 
I 
took her to a 
show one night, 
I 
almost knew Would please her quite; 
And as we sat in the parquette, 
How nice I 
felt I 
scarce can sey ; 
The bell it rang, the curtain rose ; 
A 
man came out in spangled clothes, 
Entrancing me with dashing style, 
While to my" love he gave a 
smile. 
Oh, she never flirt. 
To see my love, next day I 
went— 
To pop the question was my intent; 
Alas! poor me, I 
felt quite sore 
To henr she'd gone in a 
coach and 4itur; 
Her mother squealed and I 
did squall; 
She'd took her trunk and waterfall; 
I 
seized my hat—to the show I 
ran, 
But she'd eloped with a 
circus man. 
Oh, she never flirts. di"

Brie° 40 eta. 
Upon a 
rustic bridge we met 
One afternoon in Spring: 
His loving words I 
can't forget. 
Within my ears they ring ! 
The swans were sailing on the Lake, 
And all the Park was gay ; 
My hand in his he chanced to take 
In such a 
charming way ! 
The flowers were bright, but oh, his eyes 
They shone like stars of night ! 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delight. 
I 
seem'd in love's delicious dream, 
My heart with rapture beat ; 
And while his eyes did on me beam, 
I 
heard his lips repeat : 
CuaTius. 
There is no harm in kissing. 
Pray tell me, is there, dear ? 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting, 
No prying eyes to mark, 
There is no harm in kissing, (a 
kiss) 
At twilight in the Park! 
.1 
We strolled along where ropes grew, 
And all was bright and fair; 
Ea promised ever to be true, 
And begged my love to share. 
The little birds were flying home, 
They head my lips reply ; 
And stars were bright in yonder dome 
Before we say good bye. 
But oh, he seemed so sad to leave— 
My heart grew sad as well, 
For love within each heart did weave 
Its dear 13.1-4-itching spell ! 
We Lag

GLITTER. 
As sung by M ISS ELIA W ENER, 
They're not all gems that glitter, no! - 
Attractive though they seem, 
For tinsel has a 
spurious glow, 
A 
bright but transient gleam ; 
The thoughtless oft aro caught by thi.;, 
And most men may be sold ; 
Be careful that you don't get dross, 
Instead of shining gold. 
Caonus, 
Glitter and glare may make people stare, 
But howe'er dazzling bright it may be. 
Glitter and gloss are nothing but dross ; 
-) 
Pure gold, pure gold, the metal for me. 
Be ye as chaste, as pure as snow, 
You'll not escape the touch 
Of slander's tongue—be guarded- --and 
It w'll not harm you much. 
Be uprigh', just, and always fair, 
Each debt 'iindneas pay ; 
Let deeds, not words, reflect your worth, 
And bear the light.of day. 
Glitter and glare, 
Pure gold with some is very sc.tree, 
But wealth's a 
heeting joy ; 
The wealthy, like the poor, oft have 
Their share of life's alloy. 
Let each look round, and if he can, 
Extend a 
helping hand ; 
The peasant thus may vie the peer— 
The richest in the land. 
Glitter and glow', 
Originally sung, with great success, by Miss ADAM 
RICHMOND, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Now, Mrs. Fitzwilliarn, of Union Square, 
Presents herself to you ; 
And when she is dressed, why you may guess, 
Of gents she knows a 
few. 
A •<vidower fell in love with me. 
While riding on a 
train; 
He had his little boy with him, 
Which caused us both great pain. 
SPorcnN.—The father introduced me to his littie boy 
his Auntie, and during the whole journey he was oblig.a. 
to say— 
Cnonus, 
Tommy, make room for your Auntie, 
There's a 
little dear ; 
Tommy make room for your Auntie, 
I 
want her to sit here, 
You know Papa has got a 
cake, 
That he will give to you; 
80 pray don't annoy then, be a 
good boy, 
Make room for your Auntie, do. 
When first I 
met this widower, 
'Twas on my journey down; 
To spend a 
day at Long Branch— 
Just like a 
swell from town ; 
The widower loved romantic scenes, 
And t 
squeeze on the sly; 
So when his arm went round my waist, 
The boy began to cry. 
SPOREN.—Yes, the more the boy cried, the 
father said— 
more the 
The father told his loving son 
To watch the passing train ; 
But no, he said, Papa you'll kiss 
That lady again. 
Of course I

I've Only Been Down to the Club.

Bowery, New York. 
Last night I 
was out rather late— 
'Twas only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be; 
found her in temper and tears ; 
Oh ! she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
CHORUS. 
The " Club" had a 
meeting, to night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight. love ; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight love, 
t, only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark ; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, &c. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her Ma ; 
While I 
on the mantel-piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she'd let me alone for a-while ; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile. 
SPOMEN.—S0 I thought it a 
favorable opportunity to 
assure her once more, as a 
positive fact, that—

KEEP A STIFF UPPER LIP, 
Written and composed by SAM DEYERE. 
THERE has something gone wrong, 
My brave boy, it appears, 
For I 
see your proud struggle 
To keep back the tears: 
That is right, when you cannot 
Give trouble the slip, 
Then bear it, still keeping 
A 
stiff upper lip! 
Though you cannot escape 
Disappointment and care 
The next best thing to do, 
Is to learn how to bear 
If when for life's prizes 
You're running, you trip, 
Get up—start again, 
Keep a 
stiff upper lip! 
Let your hands and your conscience 
Be holiest and clean, 
Scorn to touch or to think of 
The thing that is mean; 
But ho d 
on to the pure 
And the right with firm grip, 
And though hard be the task, 
Keep a 
stiff upper lip! 
Throl:gh childhood, through manhood, 
Through lifc to the end, 
Struggle bravely and stand 
By your colors, my friend, 
Only yield when you must, 
Never " Give up the ship," 
But fight to the last 
With a 
stiff upper lip:

WISH MAMMA WAS HERE, 
Sung With immense -applause by A.LNE . 
DAvits. 
A TINY, pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say, 
"Now, papa, you kiss me." 
The father pressed his darling child, 
And smoothed his silken hair, 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
CHORUS. 
4` 
I wish mamma was here! 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
A 
tear rolled down the father's cheek, 
He pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh; 
He bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the falling tear, 
And Willie murmured in his sleep, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
"I wish mamma," &c. 
His darling pined that very night, 
UntL 
turn of tide, 
The angel death was near him them 
At early dawn he died. 
The foother cried in wild despair, 
Oh! live, my darling dear!" 
And Willie breathed his last fond sigh, 
" 
I 
know mamma is here!"

Oh ! he's just an fait, 
And looks so very stunning with 
That buttonhole Boquet. 
Cnonrs. 
My buttonhole bonnet, I 
wear it every day, 
Because it catches all the pretty g. 
For when I'm out to walk I 
love to hear them talk, 
And see them toss their captivating curls. 
Some say that I've got roguish eyes 
And quite a 
pleasing nose, 
While others fall in love at once 
With all my stylish clothes ; 
Again they'll say my black moustache 
Is nobby, neat and gay, 
But all are struck completely with 
My buttonhole boquet. 
By buttonhole boquet, &c. 
Let others drink the best champagre 
And eat the richest game, 
Or let them drive about the town 
A 
trotting horse of fame ; 
For I 
would rather starve myself 
On two fish balls a 
day 
Than promenade the streets without 
My buttonhole boquet.

STYLE OF THE DAY. 
As sung by JENNIE LENDSEY. 
I'm a 
jolly young leader of fashion, 
A 
belle that's so festive and free ; 
Of course you will say I 
am dashing,' 
For nothing but style suits me ; 
With young swells I 
often go driving. 
They call me so charming and gay, 
That I 
try to outdress all the others, 
And bring out the style of the day. 
Cuortos. 
Then I 
laugh and I 
wink at the fellows, 
Who oft on their knees to me pray; 
But I 
think I 
will have to stay single, 
To bring out the style of the day. 
I 
have many rivals who try to 
Outshine my gay style so fine; 
But then I 
always can beat them, 
For my Pa he owns a 
gold mine; 
If I 
owe a 
V, X, or a 
50, 
And havn't got it to pay, 
I 
just send my bill to my parient, 
And he pays for the style of the day. 
Then I 
laugh, and I 
wink, &c. 
PADDIES PROM CORX. 
1.-m-tared according to At of Congress in the year 18, by A. 1 
Aruivrat, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington 
Written and sung by the GREAT FIELDMOS. 
A .. aw years ago, from Ireland we sailed, 
Upon a 
big ship that carries the mail; 
Nine days from the time that we left the Green Isle. 
We were both landed on American Soil. 
'Twas at Castle Garden we first struck free clay. 
To see the City. we walked up Broadway. 
As we kept walking. the people would stare, 
demarking, " Who is that beautiful pair !" 
CHORUS. 
They're Paddies from Cork! 
Paddies from Cork! 
Only just landed in sweet New Yorl":. 
As we walk the street, 
Each one we meet 
Says, " There's two Green Horns, 
They're Paddies from Cork ! " 
Since we have landed, we've traveled a 
bit, 
And have not seen half this country yet. 
I've learnt a 
lot, the short time I'm here; 
Yes, he has learnt to drink Lager Beer; 
Yes, and play Billiards and Bagatelle; 
And smoke his Cigar, just like a 
swell! 
Some day. of this City I 
may be Mayor, Miss, 
Then I 
shall be known as the Mayoress! 
We're not from Cork, but the City Dublin 
And she to the world has give some great men. 
In Ireland to-day, in almost any part, 
You'll find many the man equally as smart. 
But the Government that rules won't let them rise, 
So what they possess. of course with them dies. 
Some, who's good fortune is to get to New York, 
Are greeted, when landed, as Paddies from Cork!

WHEN I 
was in my early teens 
I 
thought it such a 
lark, 
To hire 
boat and lightly skim 
The waters of the Park. 
And when by floating up and down, 
Qdte confident had g

I 
said, " I 
was not born to drown, 
By jove 
buy a 
yacht." 
But that queer s 
rt of up and down motion, 
Which one finds on the wobbledy ocean, 
Has inspired me at len

notion 
I 
muc I 
prefer land to the sea. 
I 
bought my yacht. I 
hind a 
crew, 
We look'd a 
tidy craft. 
No end ‘. f' naval terms I 
knew, 
I 
called " abaft." 
As I 
received my frIend,,, 
I 
felt 
As proud as any Lord. 
For o . e

I 
had my Nell on board.

Said he, " Why you can't navigate;" 
Said I, " I've learned the trick; 
On board I

Second Mate 
Who acts 1N hen I

Chorus.—For that qtrer, 
On went the yacht, far out to sea, 
The waves rolled mountain high, 
On Nell my 1.nguid eye I 
cast, 
She smiled, I 
could but sigh. 
For as w flew the waters; throtedi, 
Young Brown he sought her side, 
They spooned, I 
heard the false one say 
She ne'er would be my bri ,le. 
Chorus,—For that queer, &c. 
At length the storm it reached it's worst, 
The rudder was no use: 
The bottled ale by dozens burst, 
The piano it got 10(,sp. 
I 
shot s

My fiends they flew about, 
As did the tables, lamps and chairs.

AS I 
strolled out by chance one day, 
'Twas in the summer time, 
I 
first beheld a 
fairy form, 
And since I've called her mine; 
Some flowers she was bending 'DW— 
I 
begged of her a 
few; 
The glance exchanged was one of love, 
Down where the pansies grow. — Dance 
CHORUS. 
And we whispered and we lau bed so free, 
And of course we were as happy as could be, 
Oh her smiles they are as bright as the rays 
Of the sun that loves the dew ; 
Two hearts were moulded into one, 
Down where the pansies grew. 
The favor asked was but a 
bud, 
A 
rose that she posessed ; 
The little flower love implied, 
And that I'd half confess'd ; 
Her cheeks were blushing iike the leaf, 
in all its rosy hue; 
That even ng I 
exchanged a 
kiss, 
Down where the pansies gr,:w. 
And we whispered, &c. 
The flowers faded, but her love 
Remains as bright and green; 
And since the day I've called her mine, 
How haopy we have been; 
So now the story I 
have told, 
In all its joys to you, 
How I 
strolled into happiness, 
Down where the pansies grew,

FAIR PLAY. 
As sung by JOLLY NAsn. 
To do as you would be done by, is good advice, you'll own. 
Do everybody that you can, is a 
maxim better known. 
I 
do not envy other men live and let live, I 
say, 
The world is wide enough for all, if all could have fair play, 
CHORES. 
I 
don't care a 
pin what the world may say, 
I'm always rough and ready, and I 
like fair play. 
Give a 
man a 
fair chance, and stand out of the way, 
Fair play's a 
jewell, and I 
like fair play. 
How often in our law courts we see justice really blind, 
Liad many a 
poor man sent to jail when a 
rich man's only 
fined. 
Their faults, perhaps, may be the same, but one the fine 
can pay. 
The other can't, so goes to jail, I 
don't call that fair play. 
I 
don't care a 
pin, &c. 
'Twixt masters and their workingmen good feelinc, we 
should like ; 
Good masters make good workmen. ' tis bad ones cause a 
strike ; 
And if they only give the men a 
lit tie higher pay 
When higher profits they obtain. I 
sl,ould call that fair play. 
don't care a 
pin, &c. 
To get fair play for one and all then let us all combine. 
And now I 
think I'll make an end of this long song of 
mine; 
So join me in the chorus now before I 
go away,

ONLY BE KIND. 
As sting by AT.,,nv2, BESNETT. 
Why turn away when I 
draw near? 
Why cold to-day? once I 
was dear; 
Then thy heart stirred and flushed thy brcy ; 
Never a 
word comes to me now— 
Now thy hand lies listless in mine ; 
Once its replies spake love divine ; 
Cold as if we never had met ; 
Can it then be hearts can forget? 
CHORUS. 
Speak to me, speak— 
Be my heart heard, or it will break, 
For one kind word; 
No vows to bind, no pledge I 
seek, 
Only be kind—speak to me, speak. 
One idle day thou did'st deplore 
Some castaway, on desert shore ; 
'Twits but a 
tale, by poet feigned, 
Yet thou did'st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan— sad, sad to be 
Utterly lone, by the bleak sea ; 
My life is drear, I, cast away— 
Give me the tear thou shed'st that day.

Oh! yes, I

And well I 
love to cut a

I'm call'd a 
female swell. 
As I 
walk down the crowded street, 
I 
toss my flowing curls, 
And smile on ev'ry gent I 
meet, 
I'm envied by the girls ; 
The little dears, they are so shy, 
Their thot's they dare not tell, 
They are afraid to wink so sly, 
Like me, the female swell. 
Oh! yes, I 
am, &c. 
The other day I 
caught a 
beau, 
He offer'd me his arm, 
He talk'd so sweet we walk'd so slow, 
He worship'd ev'ry charm ; 
He spoke his heartfelt love to me, 
In words I 
cannot tell. 
"Pray stop," said I, " for don't you see, 
That I'm a 
female swell." 
Oh! yes, I 
am, &c.
