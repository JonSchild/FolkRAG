Saint Joseph 's Day Table 
Essay proposal /abstract for the "Faith" section 
Submitted January 28, 1991 
The major thesis of this essay is 
 
 that 
"tradition " is not a static entity but rather a dynamic 
interpretive process negotiated by those who enact it. 
I will 
discuss the Saint Joseph 's Day table tradition as practiced by 
Sicilian and Mexican Americans , two of the most numerous 
populations in Pueblo. 
I will examine the factors which fuel 
this trans -ethnic movement , including the groups ' Catholic 
heritage and the specific folk religious practices they share. 
And I will discuss the ways in which each ethnic group uses the 
tradition to makes statements about themselves. 
After the introductory paragraph , I will briefly discuss-the 
saint 's history and situate the tradition within the 
Mediterranean folk religious complex shared by Sicilian and 
Mexican Americans. 
These popular beliefs and practices involve a 
strong devotion to the —ants, particularly to the Holy Family, a 
personal relationship between the saints and their devotees, a 
home altar tradition , and the custom of making a promessa. 
I will then describe and interpret the 1989 home table event 
given by Anthony and Josephine Gagliano, Sicilian -born Americans 
who maintain close contact with relatives in Lucca Sicula 
(Sicily). 
In' many ways, the Gaglianos' table is "typical" of a 
IV 
Sicilian table in Pueblo. 
However, differences do exist between 
various tables given by Sicilian Puebloans. 
I will describe some 
of the ways the Gaglianos shaped their event to show that  
the 
table tradition is dynamic and constantly negotiated in its 
reconstruction. 
I will then describe and interpret an annual Saint Joseph's 
Day event organized by Gen Archuleta at the Shrine of the Holy 
Rosary, a Hispanic parish, for the past 17 years. 
Archuleta 
adopted the Sicilian tradition as a way to honor Saint Joseph but 
has also shaped it to meet the needs of her parish. 
I chose 
Archuleta's event because it is seemingly the most diverse from 
Sicilian tables--it has moved from the home to the parish, and to 
a virtually uni-ethnic, non-Sicilian population (there are tables 
which fall in-between these criteria). 
Yet it shows continuity 
with the Sicilian tables which, as mentioned, are also shaped in 
definite ways by their organizers. 
How and why did Archuleta 
chose to maintain continuity with the Sicilian tradition, and how 
and why did she diverge from it? 
In the conclusion, I will emphasize that the dynamic nature 
of tradition allows the Gaglianos and Archuleta/Holy Rosary to 
use the Saint Joseph's Day table tradition to express in selected 
ways what they say about themselves.

the experience with as many people as possible.

Salvatore and Rosa Ingo. 
An expert cook as well as a keeper of traditional 
knowledge concerning how to produce a Saint Joseph's table, Bessie's advice is 
often sought by other women in the Pueblo area who wish to "give" a table.

13. With greased pans arrayed on a table, five experienced cooks prepare to 
mix dough they will use to bake special bread that will be part of the Saint 
Joseph's table given by their friend Josephine Martellaro.

Saint Joseph's table given the previous year by Bessie Ingo.

Questions for Paula: 
1. Photo #1: 
Do you want to add the fact that St. Therese's congregation is 
largely Hispanic, or other information that indicates that this image 
illustrates the adoption of the tradition by Hispanics in Pueblo? 
2. Photo #7: 
Is Baca Hispanic? 
If so, is a reference to her ethnicity needed 
here? 
3. Photo #9: 
Is it necessary to indicate the saints identified with each of 
these people? 
(Josephine's seating chart is enclosed) 
4. Photo #13: 
Bea Roeder's notes do not clearly specify the names of these 
women (see enclosed). 
Can you obtain the information from Josephine? 
(I 
believe I sent her copies of this photo and Photo #14 back in late 1990 or 
early '91. 
Of course, you could send her the enclosed photo-copy and ask her 
to make the identifications.) 
5. Photo #14: 
identifications also needed for this image. 
6. Photo #18: 
What are the names of these two people? 
My guess is that 
they're Rose Lee Pisciotta (who lent the photo to us) and her late husband 
Fred, but there's no information in your notes or Paola's. 
Can you call Rose 
Lee to confirm? 
Also, ask her the date of the Saint Joseph's table this 
snapshot relates to. 
7. Photo #19: 
Please check spellings of foods carefully.
