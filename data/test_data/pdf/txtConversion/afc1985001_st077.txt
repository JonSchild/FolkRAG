My True Love's Name Is Johnny
MY TRUE LOVE'S NAME IS JOHNNY 4144 51B1
Mrs. Sullivan Shafter, 1940
My true love's name is Johnny As you may plainly see. He hired to my father A laboring
boy to be.
He hired to reap, to sow the seed, To tend my father's land, For soon I fell in love with him
As you may understand.
For six long months we courted But scarcely was it known Till they watched us close one
evening Down beyond the shady grove.
My father stepped up by my side He seized me by my hand He says, “I sent your Johnny
away To some undemon land.”
They locked me up in my own bedroom My conscience for to destroy For to weep and to
mourn For my poor Johnny boy.
My mother early next morning These words to me did say, “Your father is determined to
Disappoint your wedding day.”
I finally made her an answer Within my year to employ If it's ever prospects to increase For
my poor Johnny boy.
Go fill your glasses to the brim Let the tongue go merry round It's happy, happy is the boy
That cuts the timber down.
