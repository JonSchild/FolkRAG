Rosemarie Francis Primo interviewed by Christine Lewis 
Log of interview: 
00:00:00   Christine Lewis explains project and asks Rosemarie her name.  She explains how she 
received her African name, Kalifa, meaning someone who steps up after someone else passes.  
Kalifa is like a private name.  Current occupation is home care aide, previously a teacher.  She is 
from Curepe, Santa Margarita, a Spanish-oriented district of Trinidad and Tobago.  Currently 
lives in Brooklyn. 
00:02:30   Changes in her neighborhood, housing less accessible.  How she became domestic 
workers, problems with that term.  
00:03:30   Importance of removing stigma from the “domestic” work and “domesticated” work. 
00:04:30   Good years Rosemarie did daycare until daycare folded, moved into health care, 
found this challenging. Passed her state boards and graduated.   
00:05:00   Has had numerous positions.  Cook, teacher, student advisors, Sunday School teacher. 
00:07:00   More work history.  Doing home healthcare now for the last 11 or 12 years.   
Describes her work day step by step.  Starts with prayer.  This helps her do her best job. 
00:09:30   Checks environment upon arrival, checks if people have had breakfast, communicate, 
play, keep people safe and clean.  Leave a document about how they are, call case manager in 
event there are problems.  Asks her patients questions to see how they are, where have they been 
recently, what have they been doing.  If something is amiss she calls it in.  Good communicative 
skills needed. 
00:11:30   Patience is important.  She can’t always choose what type of patient she gets.  
Training is necessary. 
00:13:00   Home/workplace balance is important. 
00:13:30   The work can be sad, and lonely.  Her husband is not at home, chronically ill.  Runs 
her own home and her workplace homes alone.  She makes an effort to be social outside the 
home, and she prays.  DWU is her sanctuary to laugh and talk and meet people.  
00:15:00   Poetic description of coming hope—the walls welcome her home.  It is safe and clean.  
Her area of true expertise is child care, shaping how children grow.  It gives her pleasure. 
00:16:30   Children respect and protect her for having played this role, in her neighborhood.  It is 
rewarding to see the fruit of her work.  
00:17:30   Special techniques in working with the elderly.  Discerning how they are feeling, by 
expressions, without words.  Giving people breaks if they are not in the mood to cooperate.

Trying again.  Recognizing the effects of medications. 
00:19:30   Incontinence leads to sleepiness during the day.  Learning the person’s rhythm.  
Importance of not forcing people to eat or sleep.  Reminds patients she can’t always be there, 
would like to see them eat, eating prevents hospital visits. Doing exercises with two present 
patients.  Can’t diagnose but must pay attention.    Techniques to get people to eat.  Importance 
of cultural foods (one patient is Jewish).  Rosemarie has learned a lot about Jewish food over the 
course of seven years.  Privilege of being permitted to prepare this food for her.  She is not 
permitted to light the stove, though.  Not to put trayf (nonKosher) food in the fridge. 
00:26:30   There are principles to learn, like engineering. It makes your day better.  Person in 
home is called client, person in a facility is called a patient.  
00:27:30   Her client’s eating habits and preferences.  Equipment she uses to cook. Importance of 
letting her client light stove, crack eggs.  She can do the rest.  How violations are considered sin.  
00:31:00   Client is Hasidic.  Preparing their Shabbat table, steps involved.  Sabbath customs 
Friday through Saturday.  She and her client are happy with each other. 
00:34:00   Allowed to read her bible at their house, as a Christian.  Some of their customs are 
private.  She can’t sit at their big dining table.  
00:35:00   How Rosemarie handles crankiness.  First checks for physical pain, hunger, what 
she’s thinking about.  Makes jokes with client about her worrying.  Encourages her to relax.  
Difficulties of keeping client on a sleep schedule when workers are coming and going.  Good 
sleep practices.  Need to use bathroom before going to bed.  
00:39:30   Christine asks about use of any home remedies.  Rosemarie can’t introduce any 
remedies because of the religious protocols.  Jewish versus Christian holidays.  Exchanging 
information about holidays and what they mean. 
00:42:30   How holidays are not about material goods but about teachings.  Importance of not 
proselytizing.  
00:45:00   Best parts of the job, listening to her stories about escaping Hitler.  Her client’s 
sayings.  Sharing stories. 
00:46:30   Client tells her she is not black because of the color of the palms of her hands.  
Considers herself blessed to be working with Hasidic Jews. 
00:47:30   Worst parts of the job.  Rosie sings a song she sings for her client, “Mama.” 
00:49:30   Client’s reaction when she sings this song.  Calls others to hear it.  Joke that Rosie 
should get more money for this. 
00:52:00   Unpleasant incident with two of this woman’s grandsons.  One asks Rosie to expose

herself.  She explains this is inappropriate for the Sabbath (the day it occurred).  One approaches 
Rosemarie.  She warns him to go back to the table with his grandparents. She reports incident to 
a relative.  Rabbi comes over, assumes she is “turning the boys on.”  Rosie stands up for herself.  
The rabbi and the boys fall back.  Boys show respect after this but this is the worst part of the 
job.  
00:57:30   Belief boys have that no woman outside their culture is pure.  She continued to push 
back against the boys’ thinking.  Naked people on the road can’t be judged; you never know 
what has happened to the person. 
00:58:00   Rosie resists the boys’ tests. Parents know Rosie will not take any nonsense. 
00:58:30   Sometimes relatives can belittle a worker. “If you want to do my job, you are free to 
do it.”  Rosie sets a boundary.  How Rosie being a woman of color is part of the reason she is 
being treated this way.  Rosie tells rabbi she is a Christian woman and if he can’t see this, 
something is wrong with him. Reflections on how Rosie responded.   
01:03:00   Similar incidents of harassment for women of color in the south in the past.  Women 
don’t have a voice but she spoke up to the rabbi. 
 01:04:00   Emotional impact of this incident on Rosie.  Anger.  Knowing she’s not the first or 
the last person to experience something distasteful related to religious differences.  
01:05:00   A previous incident, Rosie was attacked by a Russian man in a client’s home in 
1989/1990 while taking care of a newborn.  He began choking her and she fought him off.  
Hoped the husband of her client would pursue this but he didn’t.  Her paperwork was not straight 
so she had to “suck up” this assault.  
01:08:30   Clients did not want to get rid of this man as he provided cheap labor.  She left the job 
after a year.  Her life meant nothing to them.  
01:09:00   Clients don’t take care of their relatives, prefer to rely on an outside source. How does 
Rosie manage two patients?  She prays.  She does not bring her job home.  Doesn’t talk about 
her job to relatives. 
01:11:30   Have her hours and holidays been respected. Yes, pretty much.  She is still working 
more than what the city stipulates. 
01:12:30   Considers herself blessed.  Rosie works more than 40 hours a week.  This works for 
her.  She is entitled to overtime according to the Bill of Rights. 
01:13:00   Does she believe she or others have been discriminated against based on 
undocumented status.  (Yes.)  Women being used in “business marriages” when men are already 
married elsewhere. 
01:15:00   Rosie’s situation is better than others’.  Gardening and cooking discussions are a

common bond with the client.  
 
01:16:30   Similar customs in the home, blue soap.  Overall relationship with this family is good. 
 
01:17:00   Good memories of a child whom she called Sweat Pea.  Shared affection.  Stays in 
communication with this girl, now in college.  Best memory is working with this child.  
  
01:19:30   More about work/life balance. 
 
01:20:30   Rosie’s prayer breakfasts.  How active Rosie is.  Visits her husband as well. 
 
01:21:30   Importance of telling God about your “storms.”  
 
01:24:30   How does Rosie’s work affect how she cares for her husband?  Tells husband about 
clients’ health problems, he realizes he doesn’t have it all that bad.  Clients also realize they are 
still in their homes, while Rosie’s husband is in a facility. 
 
01:26:00   Appreciation for DWU even though Rosie can’t always attend meetings. 
 
01:27:00   Rosie’s thoughts about DWU.  Necessary, fantastic.  Booklets to hand out on train 
might be useful.  Not everyone is on Facebook.   
 
01:29:00   What the DW Bill of Rights means.  Black women have come a long way. 
 
01:29:30   “The sky is not the limit because there are footprints on the moon.” 
 
01:30:00   What legislators should know.  Mandates of the Bill of Rights.  Advocacy is 
important.  How can abuses be investigated?  How can the Bill of Rights be enforced?  Women 
who are being abused need to get the word about the Bill of Rights via outreach.  What education 
or skills would Rosie like to gain? 
 
01:32:30   She would like to acquire the highest status in religious studies. 
 
01:33:30   Rosie closes with a phrase from the Psalms of David, Psalm 91. "He shall bring forth 
fruits in all age and they shall be fat and nourishing." 
 
01:34:00   “I want to be remembered, not so much by the carnal, worldly things, but my spiritual 
work with the nation. That's my parting words.”
