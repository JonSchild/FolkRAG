THE BUTCHER BOYBy Ben Rice Rcording Recording
It matters no not where I do dwell ; Where the butcher butcher's [?] that I love so wellHe stole from
me my heart awayAnd then with me he would not pay.There is a place called Linnet townWhere
my love goes and there sits downHe takes a strange girl on his kneeHe tells to her what he won't
tell me.He loves her the best, and the reason whyIs because she's got more gold than ; Her gold
will melt, her silver flyShe'll see the day she's as poor as I.She went up stairs to make her bed , And
not a word to her moher mother said,Her mother followed after her In and find what the matter
with her daughter dear.Oh mother, oh mother, you need not knowThat pain and sorrow, grief and
woeNo one, no one, no one but IShall ever wed the butcher' boy.She called her chair [???] to sit upon
her [crown?] A pen and ink for to write this downAt the end of every word she shed a tear[At the?]
end was of every word she cried, Oh, my dearWhat a foolish, what a foolish girl am ITo hang myself
for the butcher's boy.In a very short time her lather came homeInquiring where his daughter had
goneHe run upstairs , the doors door he brokeHe found her hanging to a rope. [by?] He took his
knife and cut her downAnd in her bosom, a note was foundAnd on the note these lines rote wrote
For the butcher's boy my heart was broke.Go dig my grave so strong [?] and deepPlace a marble
stone at my head and feetAnd on my breast place a snowy white dove turtle [o?] show to the world
that I died for love.
