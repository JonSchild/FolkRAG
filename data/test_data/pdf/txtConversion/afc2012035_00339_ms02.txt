Jeff Hafler – The Beauty Bubble.  Field Notes   7/26/2012 
 
I arrived at Jeff Hafler’s house at 12 noon. His house is located off of a dirt road in the 
township of Wonder Valley, east of 29 Palms in the Mojave Desert. It’s a whimsical 
place with a big sign of a cutout of a roadrunner and an arrow pointing the way up 
the dirt driveway. There are cactus and other desert fauna along the walkway to The 
Beauty Bubble Salon, which is connected to the house.  
 
When I walked in the house, Jeff and Mikal were in the kitchen with their seven-year 
old son Cash. The television was on and Cash was waiting for his friends to come 
over to swim in their pool. Jeff asked Cash to turn the television off so we could do 
the interview at the dining room table. Cash and Mikal left while I set up the recording 
equipment. I found an outlet and we put on the lavaliere microphones and we got 
started around 12:15. 
 
Jeff’s hair model and client, Lorelei Green, arrived at 1:10. We paused the recording 
so she could come in and get settled and she listened to the rest of the interview, 
which lasted approximately another forty minutes. Lorelei smiled a lot and seemed to 
enjoy listening in on the interview. At the end of the interview, Jeff signed both 
consent forms while I moved the equipment next door to his home-adjacent salon, 
The Beauty Bubble.  
 
After the interview, we went through the kitchen door into the Beauty Bubble. Liz, the 
mother of the Cash’s friend was outside. She wanted Jeff to do her hair before she 
moved to Nashville. Once we finished the interview, I photographed Jeff coloring 
Lorelei’s hair blonde. While she was waiting for the dye to set, Jeff asked Liz if she 
would allow us to record and photograph her hair session and she agreed.  
 
The Beauty Bubble is very small. There is one chair in front of a large mirror and a 
chair with a hairdryer attached in the corner. Next to the hairdryer is a washing sink 
with a chair. The three of them [Jeff, Lorelei and Liz] chatted while I took 
photographs. Jeff cut Liz’s medium length hair (past her shoulders) into a short style 
that reached the bottom of her neck. Her hair was washed, cut and then blown dry 
with a round brush. Before she left, I asked her to sign both consent forms (one from 
the Library of Congress and one for my company, Taylor Made Culture). Jeff finished 
Lorelei’s hair, she signed the consent form and left about 3:45. Around 4pm, I took 
portrait shots of Jeff. I left at 4:30
