Studio 304 is located in the Appalachian Mountains in the small remote town of Rainelle, 
West Virginia. This was my first time visiting Appalachia and to be honest, being a black 
woman, I was a little nervous about how I might be received. It was a beautiful drive 
twisting up the mountains with a few trailers alongside the road but mostly just trees. 
Brad’s home salon is located in a residential area of Rainelle.  
 
I arrived at the salon around noon. Brad welcomed me with a big warm hug and a smile. I 
instantly felt comfortable and realized my nerves were unwarranted. The salon was 
empty. Brad had cleared his schedule for the afternoon so we would have a quiet space 
to conduct the interview. I set up the recording equipment in the waiting area of the 
salon. The Marantz recorder suddenly wouldn’t turn on. It was plugged in so it wasn’t the 
batteries. I unplugged it and tried to turn the unit on with the batteries (that had just 
been charged) and still nothing. I panicked and Brad offered to go to the store to get 
more batteries. Right when he was about to leave the recorder magically started working 
and operated fine throughout the interview. I checked with Marantz company about this 
issue and they said it’s a software glitch. Anyway I was so relieved that it was working! 
The interview lasted about 40 minutes. About twenty minutes into the interview Brad’s 
mother came in and sat quietly and listened. After the interview I photographed Brad’s 
doing his mother’s hair. We chatted about different back roads I could take back to my 
hotel in Beckley, West Virginia, which was about a 45-minute drive. I left around 2:30pm.
