R: I hurt it playing basketball.
Q: Are you on the team here?
R: Mm-mm. I'm too little!
Q: What do you mean? The guys have to be really tall to be on the team?
R: Well, I couldn't do any good, you know. Everybody'd be bigger than me.
Q: How tall are you?
R: Five-three.
Q: Are your brothers and sisters short, or are you the shortest one?
R: I'm taller than my sister's that at home, but any one of the rest of them are big. My two

R: Sixteen. (laughs)

Q: Really? Did that bother you?
R: Yeah. They call me a punk.
C 39 page 3
Q: Who called you a punk?
R: Some boys bigger than me.
Q: Did you beat them up?
R: No! (laughs) They don't really mean it, they just, for fun.

R: Mm-mm. Not unless they take it too far.
Q: Well, can you think of some, like, some things that your parents think about that maybe

know, different ideas towards religion. What are some of the differences between the way
you feel about things and the way your parents feel?
R: My dad, he, he's still got his old-fashioned ways. You know, he don't like for me to go to
ball games or nothing.
Q: How come?
R: He'd just say there wasn't no sense in it. That, he says they just got to, didn't, didn't do
anything. When they were growing up. I guess he wants me to be that way.
Q: So what do you say? ( )?
R: I get mad. (laughs)
Q: Do you fight?
R: With Daddy?
Q: Yes.
R: No. (laughs)
Q: Are you sort of scared of him? What would he do, like if

he wanted to punish you? What would you do?
R: Wouldn't let me go anywhere.
Q: What about anything, does he think your hair's too long or anything?
R: Mm-mm.
Q: It doesn't matter, he have any objections to that?
R: Last year he did. I let it grow-out real long.
Q: What, down hair on your shoulders?
R: Mm-hmm.
Q: What'd he say?
R: He kept telling me to get it cut. I finally decided to get it cut in the summer, it was getting
too hot for me. He didn't, really he didn't bother me that much, though. You know, I, he'd
just say you're hair's getting too long, when are you going to get a hair-cut or something
like that.

Q: What about your mom?
R: She won't ever, I don't, she says that, what ( ) and stuff, thinks we ought to be able to
get out and do stuff like that. And she don't, she don't ever call me no liar.
Q: Well, do you think it's hard being the young, you know, young, youngest one in a family
that large, or do you think it's better, you have a better deal than your older brother and
sisters had?
R: I have a better deal. (laughs)
R: How, in what way?
Q: Well, when they were going to school, like they just got a little bit of money to spend
every day, you know. And. well,
C 39 page 5
most of the time they were lucky if they got a nickel or two. And I get a dollar a day.
Q: From your, from your parents. What do they, I mean, that sounds like a lot.

new clothes, or anything I want, just about it.

Q: Do you think, you know, because most of them are gone, it then that means your fo,
your folks have more money? So they can give you more?

working, we get, you know, we don't get as much because we have so many bills to pay
and everything.
Q: What all, did your dad own any land, or...? I mean did he have a farm near where you
are, or just a house?

ponies. And we got some chickens and guineas and a duck. And some dogs and cats.

R: Sometimes I help after school or something. In the summer, we all get out and help.
And, like, they work at night, both

of them. Mommy gets in at two, he gets in at six. And they sleep till about twelve-thirty, and
they get up and plant it or something.
Q: That's a hard schedule, isn't it? Aren't they tired?
R: Yeah, that makes them grouchy.

middle, you know?

sixty dollars a week and they're

on food stamps and they got six kids. And, well, they get shoes and stuff that they need,

to, something like they go out and buy it a little at a time. You know, like buy one person
something this week, next week, everthing. And like, they don't buy them that often. They
just have to wear those till they wear out. Not their clothes, but you know, shoes and stuff
like that.
Q: Do you, are there a lot of people, kids here at school from poor families?
R: Well, there's not that many, really. There's about fifty, I'd say.
Q: Do you think that's because most of the kids from poor families drop-out of school, or
just ...?
R: Yeah.
Q: What about your neighbor's kids? Do they go to school?
R: Yeah. They're not that old, though. The biggest one is in eighth grade.
Q: Why do you think kids drop out?
R: I don't know.

Q: I thought ( ) was a dry county. Where do they get their stuff--drive over to Hazzard?
R: Yeah, there are some people who bootleg, too.

Q: Well, do they just go over and buy a bunch and then come back and sell it for more
than they bought it for?
R: I think! (laughs) I guess that's about what they have to do to make any money.
Q: Are there still any people around who make their own, do you think? Anymore?
R: I don't know of anybody.
Q: I take it it used to be more of a common thing.
R: Yeah. My grandfather used to make it. Back when we were born he made it.
Q: Where did he hide his still?
R: In the smokehouse, I think.
Q: Did he make it to sell it, or just for himself?
R: Just for himself. He wasn't a real, you know, he didn't drink a whole lot of it. He just like,
he like it before supper or something. Once a day or something like that.

for, you know, after you go to college and stuff, if you go?
R: No.
Q: What do you think you'll do?
R: Probably go to Georgia.
Q: Why Georgia?
R: Because there's a lot of places to get a job and it has something to offer for children and
family. It's a lot of things to do, you know. Around here, there's nothing but the drive-in and
the ball game. That's why they got football, I think.
Q: Can you think of some of the teachers you've had that you just really didn't like? ( )? I
mean I'm not, I don't even know the people here, but other than those ( ). Can you think of
some of those teachers who were really bad?

Q: The first one.
R: Well, one I had, I didn't like her when I, you know, had her for a teacher, she worked us
hard, but I didn't like it. And, but now I see what she was getting at 'cause what she taught
us we had later and we needed it.
Q: Are there any, you know, people whose personalities you just didn't like? You know,
because they just weren't good people? Well, just in general, what kind of thing don't you
like in a person? I mean, what, what kind of people don't you like? It doesn't have to be
any particular person, but just what don't
