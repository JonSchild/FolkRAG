SEE THAT MY GRAVE'S KEPT GREEN.. 
Sung by MISS ROSA LEE. 
When I'm dead and gone from you, darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above, 
To him who my soul will save. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that may grave's kept green. 
Cuoitus. 
Oh, the days will come to you, darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen, 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Will you keep me, love in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
When other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word. 
klrhen you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Oh, the days will come, etc.

And I'm the boss girl with Charley, 
When Charley wants to cut a 
dash, and lick all comes 
before him, 
He steals from Pa a 
little cash for me, 'cause I 
adore him. 
When he wants to kiss me there, or when he wants to kiss

He don't go ' round behind my ear, for there's nothing shy 
in Charley. 
With his dark, etc.

ANGELS MEET ME ON THE CROSS-ROAD. 
A genuine Plantation Song and Melody. 
Sung characteristically, By T. M. HENGLEIL 
I 
rise up early in the mom, 
I 
hear old Gabriel blow his horn; 
Make haste, darkies, don't you wait, 
'Caze you all may lose them keys to de gate. 
Angels, meet me on the cross-road, nicet me, 
Angels, meet me on the cross-road, meet me, 
Angels, meet me on the cross-road. meet me, 
I 
ain't given to charge any tole. 
(Repeat Chorus.) 
What kind of shoes does the angels ware? 
Dat dey can walk around up in Heaven in de air, 
I 
stand by de gate, I 
hear de angels knock, 
And I 
put all de nickels in de missionary box. 
Angels, meet me, etc. 
$ung by Miss ELorsr, LINDON". 
I 
am a 
girl of style you see. 
And everywhere I 
go, 
Some fellows always follow me 
If I 
walk fast or slow. 
Perhaps they think my heart is true, 
Or I 
have lots of cash. 
Or its cardinal red or navy lilii 
I 
wear with such a 
dash. 
When I 
walk out at 3 
P. M., 
To take the bracing air, 
Pm sure to meet a 
score of men, 
Always at me stare. 
I 
hear them say, I 
wonder who 
That daisy there can be, 
In the cardinal red and navy blue, 
Whom we so often see. 
Some say that I'm a 
fashion plate. 
Cut from a 
magazine, 
Others, I'm a 
counterpart 
Of some young foreign queen. 
But then I 
never mind the cut. 
But go right straight ahead. 
In my cardinal red and navy blue, 
To which I'm really wed. 
When 1 
walk out. etc.

I 
HOPE I 
DON'T INTRUDE. 
Written by W , 
H. 
DELEHANTY. 
Performed by DELEHANTY k HENGLER 
rin as happy as the day is long, 
My mind is never easy, 
No matter whether right or wrong, 
You must not think me rude. 
For love it is the burden of my song, 
With joy I'm almost crazy; 
And if perchance I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude, 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
Oh, dear, don't you wish that you was me, (vin.) 
I 
feel just as happy as a 
big bumble-bee, (sym.) 
I 
was walking by her door, 
When I 
heard the music sweet, 
And my heart with joy filled over, 
I 
couldn't keep my feet. 
So keep the music ringing, 
For it makes Inc feel so good; 
And if, perchance. I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude. 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
(Da 
ace.) 
At a 
fancy ball the other night, 
Myself and little Daisy, 
We kept it up till broad daylight, 
We 
felt so awful good. 
Ohl, Daisy locked so fair and bright, 
She set the men all crazy; 
And if they asked her for to dance, 
She'd ask me it she could, 
And then I'd say in a 
careless way— 
hcpe T 
don't intrude. 
Oh. dear, etc. 
SWEET HAPPY DAYS. 
Words and Music by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
Oh! I 
never shall forget the happy days, 
Happy days! Happy days! 
When upon the old plantation, 
All the darkies took vacation, 
And they left their heavy work 
And went to play. 
Then we took the banjo, fiddle and the bones, 
And the bones! And the bones! 
And you ought to hear the ringing, 
Of the merry voices singing, 
In the chorus of the dulcimatie tones, 
CHORUS. 
Oh! happy days! sweet happy days! 
When we took the banjo, fiddle and the bon; .-;; 
And the bones! And the bones! 
Yes, you ought to hear the ringing, 
Of the merry voices singing, 
In the chorus of the dulcimatic tones. 
Oh ! I 
never shall forget Miss Susie Brown, 
Susie Brown! Susie Brown! 
Yes, the beauty of her mouth, 
Was a 
picture of the South. 
And they say she was " the Belle of all the town." 
We used to be together all the while, 
All the while! 
All the while! 
And she looked so very charming, 
That I 
could'ut see the harm, in 
A 
kissing her until I 
made her smile,

PATRICK MIND TIE BABY I 
f4ang in HARRIGAN sad HART'S Great Sketch of the " Bradys.* 
Copyrighted 1816. try A. J. FISHER., 98 Nassau St., New York. 
I'm the father of a 
bouncing girl, 
With cheeks like cherries red; 
She's a 
credit to the neighborhood, 
I'm only twelve months wed. 
When I 
come home from labor 
After toiling all the day, 
Me wife puts Neily in me arms, 
And this to to me did say— 
CHORUS, 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
Arrah can't you mind the child! 
Tie it up in an over-coat, 
She's surely going wild. 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
Mind the child awhilel 
She'll kick and bite, 
And cry all night, 
Arrah Patrick mind the child. 
There was castor-oil, and soothing syrup, 
And paregoric to, 
Was give to the child when she had fit „ 
But nothing would bring her to; 
She'd put mustard plasters on her feet, 
And give her a 
bowl of tea, 
And then she'd lay her in my arms, 
And this to me would say— 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
1.h when Nelly grew up to a 
lady, 
I 
had no control at tall; 
She'd say I 
am no baby, 
As she waltz away to a 
ball. 
Bad luck to me joy theie came a uoy 
Last St. Patrick's day; 
Me wife put Patsy in me arms, 
And this to me did say—

To dat dear old Cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch-dog hark. 
And we'd listen to the murmur of the wind. 
It seem to say to me. 
'A-on people must be free," 
For de happy time in coming. Lord be praised!

der if ole massa am still libin'? 
But no; de ole—good kind ole 
massa—am dead by dis time. 
I 
wonder if any ob de ole folks 
am libin' yet? I 
feel so tired.

When 
I 
think ob de ole man, it makes me weep, fo' massa was always 
good an' kin' to me. (
Enter George ,from cottage.) 
Master, can 
you tell me if ole Massa Stone am libin' yet? 
Is ole Massa 
dead? 
GEORGE. — .Yes. 
I'll go and attend to them black devils, and 
see what they are making all that noise for. 
.JEFF'.— Yes, you am worse dan a 
black debil. 
Dey am black 
folks, but dey hab a 
white heart. 
How folks am changed! 
When I 
was young no one would dar' to speak in de manner 
dat white trash does. 
Time changes all things. 
Yonder on de 
hill was de place whar my ole wife Hannah an' I 
once libed; 
but dey am no cabin dar now. 
And dar, what dat ole cottage 
is, was Massa Stone's cottage, but it am wasted away. 
Yonder 
under dat ole tree is whar de darkies used to gather, and play 
de banjo an' sing an' dance. 
What happy days dey was den! 
Massa an' ole Missis am dead an' gone, an' dar am no one lef' 
but me; an' it mos' breaks de ole man's heart to think dat de 
*le home ain't what it used to be. (Sings) 
THE OLD HOME AINV WHAT IT USED TO BE. 
De ole home ain't what it used to be, 
De banjo an' fiddle dey am gone; 
An' no mo' do we hear de darkies singin', 
Among de sugar- cane an' corn. 
Great changes hab come to de poor culled man, 
But dis change makes me sad and forlorn; 
Fo' no mo' do we hear de darkies singin' 
Among de sugar-cane and corn. 
Cliollrs.
—  
No, de ole home ain't what it used to be, 
De change makes me sad and forlorn ; 
Fo' no more do we hear de darkies singin' 
Among de sugar-cane " a' corn. 
In de fields I 
hab worked when I 
thought ' twas hard, 
But night brought its pleasures an' its rest; 
In de ole house down by de ribber side, 
De place oh all de best. 
Oh, whar are de children dat once used to .play, 
In de lane by de ole cabin door; 
Dey am scatter'd now, an' o'er de world dey roam, 
De ole man will neber see dem more. 
No, de ole home, etc.. 
Now de ole man would rather libed dan died, 
In de home whar de children were born; 
But when freedom came to de culled man, 
He ler de cotton field an' corn. 
Dis ole man has libed out his threescore and ten, 
An' he'll soon hab to lay down and die; 
Yet he hopes to go unto a 
better Ian', 
So now, ole cabin home, good bye. 
No, de ole home, etc.

uttered scarce a

Like a 
guilty thing I 
started,

And thy words were cold and high,

Not long ago I 
went to see 
Baba played at Niblo's, 
I 
saw a 
gal on the stage I 
knew, 
We used to call her Loose- clothes. 
When she peddled applesand nuts, her name 
Was Mary Ann Mahoney; 
But now, her name was on the bills, 
As Mademoiselle Broccoloni. 
CHORUS. 
Dancing ' round the stage she'd go, 
Mashing all the bloods, you know, 
And spin like a 
top on her big toe, 
This gal that danced in Baba. 
She'd dance, and then she'd smile and bow, 
The applause came down in showers; 
And bloods, with glasses on their eyes, 
Would throw her baskets of flowers, 
She'd squirm like an eel, and raise her leg 
To a 
terrible elevation; 
She'd stand on her toes and bend the crab, 
Which caused a 
great sensation. 
Dancing ' round, etc, 
Her head was once a 
cardinal red, 
With hands like sides of bacon; 
But now, with her grand Italian airs, 
I 
thought I 
might be mistaken. 
I 
soon found out she never came 
From the land of maccaroni; 
For she fell on the man with the big bass fiddle, 
When I 
yelled out Mary Ann Mahoney. 
Dancing ' round, etc.

'I he sweetest little creature in the village. 
Her face is like a

And she lives within a

There may be maidens just as fair, 
With the same bright winning ways; 
But none with eyes so lovely, 
Such a

Oh, yes, she is a 
beauty, so loving kind and crue, 
And the only girl to suit me. 
With her laughing eyes of blue.

THE LAND OF DREAMS. 
As sung by T. M. HENGLEZ. 
In the pleasant Summer evening. 
I 
lie beneath the shade, 
Watching the shadows 
That dance on the meadows, 
When the day begins to fade ; 
When a 
sweet remembrance comes to me 
Like a 
long forgotten strain 
Of music, awaking 
And freshly breaking 
Over my heart again. 
In visions of the past, 
I 
see my love arise, 
And in my dreaming 
I 
feel the beaming 
Of her soft, compassionate eyes ; 
Ah ! Thus may saddened hearts renew 
Their life's pure morning beams ; 
On the past to ponder, 
And softly wander.

strolled out by chance one day, 
'Twas in the summer time, 
I 
first beheld a 
fairy form, 
And since I've called her mine; 
Some flowers she was bending o'er— 
I 
begged of her a 
few; 
The glance exchanged was no of love, 
Down where the pansies grow.—Dance 
Gnowes. 
And we whispered and we lau lied so free, 
And of course we were as happy as could be, 
Oh her smiles they are as bright as the rays 
Of the sun that loves the dew ; 
Two hearts were moulded into one, 
Down where the pansies grew. 
The favor asked was but a 
bud, 
A rose that she posessed ; 
The little flower love implied, 
And that I'd half confess'd ; 
Her cheeks were blushing Ake the leaf, 
in all its rosy hue; 
That even ng I 
exchanged a 
kiss, 
Down where the‘yansies 
And we whispered, itc. 
The flowers faded, but her love 
Remains as bright and green ; 
And since the day I've called le r

While sauntering by the seaside, 
Where the wavelets kissed the shore,

To a

Had traced out in fancy letteis 
Those initials on the sand,

Forever they will stand 
Like diamonds, treasured in my heart,

As fair as any flower that grows 
She is the jewel of my heart, 
The Belle of all the land; 
I'll ne'er regret the night I 
met 
Initials on the sand. 
One evening, in the ball room, 
I 
beheld a 
beauty proud, 
In her handsome silks attired; 
She was mingling with the crowd, 
And while in the mazy Polka, 
On a 'kerchie fin her hand 
I 
espied the same initials

Was now gone forever from me,

THE AMERICAN FLAG. 
M R. FRANK LEWIS' Great Originfd Song, as Sung by him 
over 100 times, in New York and Philadelphia. 
Wonderful that glorious emblem, boys, the banner of the free. 
The stars and stripes which brighEy wave, supreme o'er land and sea 
It floated proud when nations tried to drag it through the mire, 
It filled brave men in every clime with patriotic fire. 
It shed its radiance through the world on Concord's Village Green ! 
Wherever Liberty, it shines, that emblem can be seen. 
It stood on Bunker's Mountain Coast, where Warren nobly 
And in the cause of Freedom boys, it all the world defied. 
It spread its folds at Valley Forge, 'mid storm of rain and snow; 
It floated proud at Trenton, boys, where prostrate lay the foe; 
O'er Washington it placed its wings, as in the boat he stood, 
When bold the Delaware he crossed, and braved its angry flcod 
It brightly waved at Dollymount, when Gildersleeve he shot; 
When Bodine, Fulton, and the rest, the golden prizes got; 
And when the Cumberland went down 'mid screams of wild despair, 
It proudly floated o'er the wreck, undaunted still was there. 
ts folds protected Sheridan when he did swiftly ride; 
It went with Sherman to the sea, when he to conquer tried. 
Defending it young Ellsworth fell, and free without a 
stain. 
It spread out its victorious stripes with Scott at Lundy's Lane. 
It went with Rough and Ready against a 
foreign foe; 
Its shadow spread destruction o'er the plains of Mexico, 
And down with Jackson, in the South, behind his cotton bales, 
That starry emblem was unfurled ' till victory prevailed. 
It floats on every foreign shore, our own beloved flag! 
And curses light on him, my boys, who low its folds would drag; 
On sea, that emblem, far and wide, is worshipped by our tars; 
On land each Freedom's loving Son does bless its Stripes and Stars! 
But brighter, boys, it ne'er did shine, than when the people all, 
Met on the Fourth of last July, in Independence Hall— 
And raised that banner to the clouds with loud triumphant cry— 
That just one linndrod years had passed, since it did the world defy.

Her little hand was held in mine ; 
How could I 
lose the chance 
To ask if I 
might see her home, 
When e'er she choose to go. 
I

would die 
If she should answer no; 
But then she looked so smiling, 
Her pretty little ways beguiling. 
As she said, yes, to me. 
Oh, she tilled my heart, ..tc.

But if you'll all be pleased to call,

have told her I 
loved her, 
And she's told the same to me; 
And we have often promised each other 
That we will constant be.

Her head upon my breast; 
In sweet and loving words, I 
got the hand, 
Of the one tIrt T 
love best.

Blue eyed beauty, sweetly dreaming, 
Golden hair so softly streaming,

Form of fairy, winsome, airy, 
Movements of a

Brighter gem than decks the starry 
Diadem of night; 
Rose tints wreathing, perfume breathing, 
Cheeks and ruby lips ; 
Chains of love unconscious weaving, 
Where'er her footstep trips. 
Merry, laughing, L. 
What the measure ? Gods would treasure 
Such transcendent bliss ; 
Oh! the deep, enchanting pleasure— 
One ecstatic kiss ! 
Still to love her, still to hover 
Near her, and to gaze 
Into orbs whose liquid lustre 
Brightens all one's days.

regimental step. 
We had our choice of going to the army or to jail; 
Or it's up the Hudson river with a, " copper" take a

Oh we cursed the day we went away wid the nigelar Arra)

Forty miles a 
day, on beans and hay, 
In the Regular Army 0.

We came near being made bald-headed, but they never got our

We lay among the ditches, in thc 3 ‘ ,Ilow dirty mud, 
And we never saw an onion, a 
turnip or a 
spud, 
Oh we were taken prisoners, conveyed forninst the Chafe, 
Oh he said we'll make an Irish stew, the dirty Indian thole, 
On the telegraphic wire we walked to Mexico. 
We bless the day we skipped away from the Regular Army 0! 
There was Sergeant, Sc. 
We've been dry as army herrings, and as hungry as a

(Looks around.) Surely 
this must he the place. 
It looks the same as it did three years 
ago. 
(Seats himself at table.) 
I wonder if 
Charley is home. 
He must have received my letter. 
The place seems very lone-
some. I 
will try and see if I

Written by Bonny _
NEWCOMB, and sung with great success by 
W ILLIAM SCANLAN, at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Music published by JOHN PERRY, Washington St., opposite Boston 
Theatre, Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full—it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny ! why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain; 
And every time he came on the stage, 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A family? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he lov'd them as dear as his life; 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' eltildren and wife. 
There Caine one night, and I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A character new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for ninny it day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew- they'd laugh ' till their sides Av011Id ache 
And they long'd for the curtain to rise. 
The play so 4m Ligan—each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance. and then 
To give him a 
cheerful It ! 
For Dorkins to make his first entranee, and them 
To give hint a 
cheerful hi! Li! 
At last he appeared, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see; 
" 
Why, Dorkins is playing quite badly to- night!" 
The people said, sitting 'round me. 
A hiss! yes, it was; I 
saw Dorkins start 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all 'round, 
While his head on his breast he would hang. 
" 
He's drunk!" some one said, and I 
thought so myself, 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said— 
'If I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The fault's not the heart, but the heml. 
There's many a 
night I've made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well stand; 
And every effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan; 
"I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little ono dying at home! 
I'll tell you the reason—I 'know you won't laugh— 
/ye a 
little one dying at home P

applause. 
Air.—" Eileen Anna." 
My name is Pat Delaney, I 
came from Tralee, 
I 
live in a 
great big tenement house, way up in Avenue C; 
There's a 
family lives next to me that keeps up a 
teurible roar, 
About Eileen Alanna and their aligns asthore. 
First their youngest boy, and then their eldest brother, 
All join in he chorus with the sister and his mother; 
When I 
get home at night, boys. I 
hear that terrible roar 
Of Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
CHORUS. 
Working hard all day, I 
think it mighty hard. 
Climbing 11/9 a 
forty foot ladder, carrying a 
great big hod, 
When I 
get home at night, boys, to hear that terrible roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their aligns asthore. 
Early in the morning, before I 
do get up, 
Before I 
ate a 
mouthful, or before I 
drink a 
sup ; 
They be singing in the hallway ' till my heart it is quite sore, 
About Eileen Alai= and their august asthore. 
If I 
had influence in the ward I 
do belong, 
I'd go and see the judge, and have him push their case quite 
4rong. 
I'd have them all arrested, and that would stop their roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their auffus asthore. •

It

Iitampty Tiumpty.—The arcsatest Trick Book of the Ag# 
It pleases both old and young. 
It is the Fac-simile of a 
trick practised 
by all the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and lt 
4 accompanied with directions so plainly written that, with a single pe 
rusal, any person may become an adept in an unfailing source of 
amusement. Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
" 
an ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been sent ns, 
called Humrry DUMPTY,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportu-
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ap-
pearance of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is sr, 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting thr leavef 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any oue of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit; the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."—Phil. Eve. Ball

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and mest widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We ha-ie

These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many or the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the dire. t 
ohs have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinai y 
under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to theta from all parts of the U. S.

Cotirt 
Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too tearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom add a 
sense of propriety, 
from do.ng anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
She state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
.bnt may be enjoyed by evening parties
