The death damps are gathering fast to my brow. 
And whispers thy love, its music will lay' 
Deep, deep, in ' try soul when we've passed away. 
Don't shrink from me darling, no rudeness or stain 
Shall rest on this hour, kiss, kiss inc again.

Don't shrink from me, darling, no rudeness or stain, 
Shall rest on this hour, kiss, kiss me again. [ Repeat. 
Oh, kiss me again the cold world has laid 
Its mandate upon us and we have obeyed. 
Thy borne has been sacred, thine honor to me 
Was dearer than life even ever could be. 
Don't tremble, my darling, my heart and my brain 
has held but one passion—oh, kiss me again. 
Don't shrink, exc.

Close, close to thee, dearest., untrarnelled and free,

IRELAND WILL YET BE FREE. 
A ir: ' Liberty Tree." 
Let tyrants exult, and their mandates proclaim, 
Their sceptres with iron hands sway ; 
Oppression the Irish heart never can tame, 
Nor drive hope of freedom away. 
The yoke may be heavy and firm in its place, 
The fetters secure all may be; 
But blood will wash out this most shameful disgrace, 
And Ireland ere long shall he free. 
The day may be distant—perhaps it is near, 
When freedom shall dawn on our land, 
'When Ireland no longer a 
tyrant need fear, 
Her rights she will seek and demand. 
Her fields, now deserted, shall blossom once more, 
Her ships will skim over the sea ; 
The hirelings of England be hurled from our FJ.ore, 
And Ireland will truly be free. 
Then toast our fair Island, my countrymen all, 
" 
Success to her struggle so nigh ;" 
Her sons will spring forth at the first trumpet call, 
And battle for freedom, or die ! 
Then when we have conquered and peace smiles again, 
Let this our grand toast ever be : 
"Confusion to tyrants wherever they reign," 
And Ireland shall ever be lilac I 
TOPSY S SONG. 
I'm but a 
little Nigger gal, 
As black as black can be; 
You know I 
can't love nobody, 
'Cos nobody loves me. 
Dey used to whip us long ago, 
And den I 
wish to die— 
I 
specs I 
don't krow how to love, 
And dat's de reason why. 
Now what's de use for sick as me 
Ob trying to be good 
if you„could wash de black-a- moor 
Quite white, may-be I 
would. 
Miss Feely preachee talk all day, 
She says me tell big lie— 
No good for me to speak de truth. 
And dat's de reason why. 
She can't abear the Nigger gal— 
Miss Feely mak' me laugh--
I 
touch her hand, she brush away. 
As if de black come off. 
I 
is so wicked—dat's de ting, 
I 
specs be worse by'n by ; 
She says I 
is, and so I 
is, 
And dat's de reason why. 
But you, Miss Evy, you so good. 
I 
mind de words you say— 
You're not afraid to touch my hand, 
You neber turn away. 
You talk to me, you gib me smile, 
Till tears come in your eye, 
You hub me, and I 
hub you too, 
Ann des e.e reason why.

THE EXILES DEVOTION. 
By T. D. M'GEE. 
If I 
forsw,ar tin' art divine 
Witicll deities the dead— 
What comfort, then, can I 
call mine, 
-What solace seek instead ? 
For from my birth our country's fame, 
Was life to me and love, 
And for each loyal Irish name 
Some garland still I 
wove. 
I'd rather be the bird that sings 
Above the martyr's grave, 
Than tole. lc fortune's cage my wings, 
A 
in.: 
fee. my soul a 
slave. 
I'd rather turn one simple verse 
True to the Gfelic ear. 
Than sapphic odes I 
might rehearse 
With Senates lisrning near. 
Oh, Native Land I (lost ever mark. 
When the world's din is drown'd, 
Betwixt the dayli ,rht and the dark 
A wandering solemn sound, 
That on the western wind is borne 
Across thy dewy breast? 
It : 5 
the voice of those who mourn 
For thee, far in the west. 
For them and theirs, I 
oft essay 
Your ancient art of song, 
And often sadly turn away 
Deeming my rashness wrong; 
For well I 
ween, a 
loving will 
Is all the art I 
own, 
Alt, me I 
could lo -e 
suffice for skill, 
What triumph I 
had known ! 
Me Native Land, my Native Land, 
Live in my memory still ! 
Break on my brain, ye supres grand 
Sta•li up, mist- covered hill ! 
Still in the mirror of the mind

Father, of you ; Mother, of you; 
Sisters, Brothers, all, I 
dream of you, 
In slumber I 
hear happy voices, still singing, 
Echoed over the valley and hill far away, 
I 
hear from yon green the old banjo now ringing, 
To which all the dailies are dancing so gay. 
CHORUS. 
Father, of you ; Mother, of you ; 
Sisters, Brothers, all, I 
dream of you. 
Oh ! sad was the hour my bright home forsaking, 
I 
roamed amid strangers, cold hearted and vain,

FAIRY NELL. 
A sweet little belle, 
Is my fairy Nell, 
No queenly airs about her; 
She's lovely and neat, 
Her voice is so sweet, 
There's every charm surrounds her. 
I 
met her at church, 
Around her did lurch, 
And said, " Miss, your name pray tell," 
She said " you seem kind, 
I 
really don't mind, 
My Pa says I'm his Fairy Nell."

A sweet little belle,

Her voice is so sweet, 
That every charm surrounds her. 
I 
said, " little Nell, 
I 
really can't tell, 
But something strange's the matter ; 
My heart feels so queer, 
That much I 
do fear, 
It's love ; I 
do not flatter. 
She said it was love, 
For her heart ceas'd to move, 
When first she laid eyes on me; 
I 
said, " Is it so ?" 
She said, "' twos a 
go,' 
And that we might soon married be."

I

He hein'd and he haw'd,

YOUNG AMERICA TO OLD IRELAND GREETING 
AIR.—" The Wife's Dream." 
Should Ireland raise her standard green 
Ri3olved to free the land, 
She'll find that Young America 
Will lend a 
helping hand. 
Aye—men and money he will give, 
The tyrant to o'erthrow, 
For the deeds of Young America, 
The world does surely know. 
When threatened by internal foes, 
Who clamored at our doors; 
Ireland's gallant sons sprang forth 
By many hundred scores. 
And should we be ungrateful then? 
The thought is quite absurd : 
So, men and money shall be sent 
If Ireland says the word. 
America this greeting sends 
To Ireland's distant shore, 
And bids her sons to struggle on 
Till tyrants rule no more. 
For Erin's Isle will yet be free 
If all her sons unite, 
And swiftly strike the deadly blow, 
For right, with them, is might. 
Why should ye think of England's wealth, 
Or military strength, 
For like America of old 
You'll beat your foe at length. 
Rely on Young America, 
We'll not forget the past, 
But aid you in the strife, until 
Old Ireland's free at last. 
ME AND ELIZA

Which made the white folks for to stare so, 
As we were passing down Broadway. 
CHORUS.

And roll their eyes at me and Eliza, 
Darkie sigh as we pass by, 
And roll their eyes at me and Eliza. 
The first time that I 
saw Eliza, 
The weather was very warm, 
She was taring home her mother's washing. 
With a 
basketful hung on her arm.

MEMORY BELLS . 
Words and Music try IIENRY TUCKER. 
DARLING, how can I 
forget thee, 
how lose the memory sweet 
Of the hour when first I 
met thee, 
And laid my true heart at thy feet. 
There we plighted vows so truly— 
There in sorrow wild did part, 
Memory bells are ever ringing 
Those mournful changes o'er my heart. 
Cuouus—Murmuring sweetly, cheerily— 
And the tale their music tells while ringing, 
Bids me hope for days of joy, love, 
Those gentle, murmuring memory bells. 
When the silent stars are weeping, 
I 
gaze in grief and pain, 
As my lonely watch I'm keeping, 
Ah, shall we ever meet again 
Cheering souls, with sorrow laden, 
Memory bells—ohl ne'er depart, 
But with pictures of those by-gones, 
Bring hope to glad the weary heart.

Oh! once I 
could eat my fill of good meat, 
And whiskey galore, I 
could route into me, 
I 
could streel up and down ev'ry street in this town, 
With always a 
quarter to go on a 
spree. 
My clothes they were good, I 
ne'er thought of wood, 
A 
pick or a 
spade ne'er enter'd my mind, 
3ut now I'm tn grief, since that blackhearted thief, 
Jeff Davis; he brought these hard times upon me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
bad luck to him early. 
Bad luck to him dearly, 
May the devil admire 
Where e'er he may be; 
May musquitoes smite him, 
And rattlesnakes bite him, 
The traitor that brought 
These hard tunes upon me. 
Oh I 
I 
walk up and down every street in this town, 
And the devil a 
smell of a 
glass can I 
get, 
Olt I 
I 
go everywhere to ease my despair, 
But the hunger begor, keeps me in a 
big sweat, 
Of my clothes there's as much as would boulster a 
crutch.

And my shirt wants a 
rivet or two in each scam,

THE LAND OF DREAMS. 
By SAMUEL LOVER. 
There is a 
land whore fancy's twining 
Her flow'rs around life's fading tree, 
Where light is ever softly shining, 
Like sunset o'er a 
tranquil sea. 
'Tis there thou dwell'st in beauty's brightness, 
More fair than aught on earth e'er seems, 
'Tis there my heart feels most of lightness. 
There in the lovely Land of Dreams, 
There in the lovely Lind of Dreams. 
'Tis there in groves I 
often meet thee, 
And wander thro' the sylvan shade, 
While I 
in gentlest accents greet thee, 
My own, my sweet, my constant maid 
There by some fountain fair reposing, 
Where all around so tranquil seems, 
'We wait the golden evening's closing, 
There, in the lovely Land of Dreams. 
But when the touch of earthly waking, 
Hath broken slumber's sweetest spell, 
Th ose fabled joys of fancy's makidg, 
Are in my heart rentember'd well ; 
The day in all its sunshine splendor, 
Less fair to me than midnight seems, 
When visions shed a 
light more tender, 
Around the lovely Land of Dreams. 
When I 
think of the friends of my youth, 
And the hearts that were dear to me then, 
I 
turn with a 
sigh to the days gone by, 
Yet I 
love to recall them again. 
When I 
think of the friends that once were mine, 
And hearts that were gentle and true, 
My heart still bends to my good old friends, 
And I 
sigh when I 
bid them adieu. 
CHORUS. 
For my heart still bends to my good old friends, 
To my good old friends of yore, 
And I 
turn with a 
sigh to the days gond by, 
And the hearts that shall greet me no more. 
When I 
think of A mother so kind, 
And the hearth of my childhood so dear, 
Wherever I 
roam I 
dream of that home, 
With a 
sigh that would melt to a 
tear. 
When I 
think of that hand that led me forth, 
And the footsteps that followed my own, 
And my eyes they smiled when she called me a 
child, 
have faded and left me alone. 
For my heart, & c.

THE NIGHT WIND SIGHS ALONE. 
Words by F. C Buusaso.—Music by A. S. 
SULLIVAN 
The tinkling sleep bell knells the parting day, 
The flocks collect r. rom ineadow, lull, and 1111101', 
The happy goathered homeward takes his way, 
His wife and children wait hint at the door, 
ills wile and children wait him at the door. 
To me the bells send up no cheering tone. 
Only the night wind sighs alone, alone : 
To me the bells send up no cheering thee, 
Only the night wind sighs alone, alone, 
Only the night wind sighs alone, sighs aloue. 
Tinkle the bells upun the mountain steeps. 
Fainter fuel fainter down the narr40v ways, 
Now in his cot. the shepherd, ere he sleeps, 
Joins with his lov'd ones in theis byte,' of praise, 
Joins with his lov'd ones in their hymn of praise. 
To me the bells send up no cheering tone, 
Only the night wind sighs alone, alone. 
To me tle, bells send up 110 cheering tone, 
Only the night wind sighs alone, alone, 
Only the night wind sighs alone, sighs alone.

Though you gentleman are smiling, 
Its very plain to me, 
But most of you are single, 
Which of course ought not to be. 
There's girls I'm sure in plenty, 
Who would your happiness advance, 
By wedding you to- morrow 
If they only had a 
chance.

Then don't be shy, for single life's a 
sin; 
Fair lady, as the proverb says, 
Faint heart did never win, 
Then don't be shy, 
But do the best you can, 
And when you go a 
courting 
Why, speak out like a 
man. 
When at your kind attentions, 
We appear to take offence; 
Pray don't be disconcerted, 
That's merely a 
pretence 
If to wring your ears we I 
hreaten, 
We of course mean no such thing, 
It's merely a 
sugg,estion— 
We ourselves should like a 
ring. 
Then don't be shy, etc. 
Though we ladies are as sisters 
To the angels up above, 
Yet only whisper marriage. 
And we're gentle as a 
dove. 
To say " 1

When the question popp'd may be, 
But " Xó " would be an answer 
Much more silly you'll agree. 
Then don't be shy, etc,

THREE FISHERS WENT SAILING. 
W ords by REV. G KINGSLEY. 
Music by JOHN HULLAH. 
Three fishers went sailing out into the west, 
Out into the west as the sun went down. 
Each thought on the woman who loy'd him the best, 
And the children stood watching them Out of the town. 
For men must work, and women must weep, 
And there's little to earn and many to keep 
Thu' the harbor bar be moaning. 
Three wives sat up in the light-house tow'r, 
And they trim'd, the lamps as the sun went down, 
They look'd at the squall, and they look'd at the show'r, 
And the night-rack came rolling up ragged and brown I 
But men must work, and women must weep, 
Tho' storms be sudden and waters deep, 
And the harbor bar be moaning. 
Three corpses lay out on the shining sands, 
in the morning gleam as the tide went down, 
And the women are weeping and wringing their hands 
For those who will never come back to the town, 
For men must work, and women must weep, 
And the sooner its over the sooner to sleep, 
And good bye to the bar and its moaning. 
CUSHLAIYIACHREE. 
Words by T. COOK. 
Music by EMIL STADLER. 
Dear Eain how sweetly thy green boson rises 
An Emerald set in the ring of the Sea, 
Each blade of thy meadows my faithful heart prizes, 
Thou queen of the west the world's Cusblamachree 
Thy gates open wide to the poor and the stranger. 
There smiles hospitality hearty and free, 
Thy friendship is seen in the moment of danger 
And the wand'rer is welcom'd with Cushlamachree. 
Thy sons they are brave but the battle once over, 
Brotherly peace with their foes they agree, 
And the roseate cheeks of thy daughters discover, 
The soul speaki g blush that says Cusblamachree. 
Then flourish forever my dear native Erin, 
While sadly I 
wander an exile from thee, 
And firm a.= thy mountains no injury b-arim , 
May Heaven defend its own Cusblainachr. ,e.

LITTLE MARY ANN. 
In a 
sweet little village, by the banks of a 
stream, 
Where poets love to wander, and where music seems to aream ; 
Where the pretty little spire points the way to happier spheres ; 
And by its soothing charms sheds comfort o'er declining years. 
In a 
little shady lane, long before I 
was a 
man, 
Did I 
whisper vows to heaven, and little Mary Ann. 
The time flew slowly by, ' till I 
numbered years did wait, 
And reached that joyous time, that gives manhood its estate; 
I 
mast now prepare to follow as the plough, so runs my song, 
Of the husbandman that cheered them all, so merrily along; 
I 
did as duty bade me, and I 
ever sought a 
plan, 
To enable me some Summer's morn, to wed with Mary Ann. 
By industry I 
gained a 
little fortune of my own, 
For well I 
knew that what I 
reaped must first be duly sown ; 
So I 
gained a 
little c 
ttage, and a 
garden, in full store, 
With roses twined with honeysuckles, graced my cottage door; 
I 
now was nigh complete, so to perfect make my plan, 
I 
hastened and I 
married sweet little Mary Ann. 
The squire from the village gave the blooming bride away; 
We called each year to thank him, upon our wedding day. 
He gave her a 
bright nosegay of flowers, rare to view ; 
We keep them in our Bible, safe away from frost or dew ; 
Each year our joy increases, as time our ages span, 
And the village song from worn ' till night is little Mary Ann. 
AN IRISHMAN'S RAMBLES. 
Words by W. CARLETON. 
riT1 an Irishman bent on my rambles, 
Of strange sights I've seen faith a 
few, 
But ' Lis of the queer things Eye not seen, 
I'm now going to relate unto you. 
When in Nev York city I 
landed, 
I 
walked up Broadway, do you see, 
But if Broadway was walking up me, boys, 
What a 
queer looking sight it would be. 
George Washington's statue on horse back, 
Stands in the great Union Square, 
lie brought all the States to Independence, 
I 
wish it was so every where. 
The General is riding his pony, 
So nate and so tidy you see, 
But if the pony was riding the General, 
At a 
queer looking sight it would be. 
I 
then took a 
walk down the Boworv, 
The boys and the girls for to see, 
And to get a 
small drop of the crayther, 
As I 
was out on a 
bit of a 
spree. 
A 
nigger was eating an oyster, 
m-rry an," happy we-. he, 
Bet. if ti e 
seer 
as (- aline. the nigger, 
• 11 hat a queer looking sight it would be. 
THE RISING GENERATION 
Go where you will, you'll get your fill of modern airs and 
graces— 
Our little boys desert their toys to put on manly faces— 
With dyed moustache they cut a 
dash, go in for dissipation ; 
With quizzing glass they eye each lass, this Rising Generation. 
When not sixteen they're often seen upon some midnight frolic. 
They wink their eye and wiggle by, like a 
lobster with th. 
colic; 
Oft in a 
fight at dead of night they're draggged off to the 
station, 
Papa will pay the fine next day for this Rising Generation. 
Their ma's we'd thank if they would spank those naughty little 
I 
riskers, 
Or take the dears and box their ears, or pull their little 
whiskers. 
But no, they say, our boys are gay, a 
pattern for the nation; 
They are our pride so let them slide, this Rising Generation. 
And then the girls with flowing curls raised on the head of 
others, 
Each one a 
belle who cuts a 
swell, outrages like the brothers •, 
They flirt their fans like warming pans for public approbation ; 
Dressed out like dulls with waterfalls, this Rising Generation. 
And then the pets wear fishing nets, with which to catgli some 
sculping; 
They make you treat for all they eat, for they are fond of 
gulping. 
Ice cream, strawberries, peaches, cherries, they eat a 
hearty 
ration, 
And they don't go back on their apple jack, this Rising Gene 
ration.

They look'd such grim and grizzly frights,

A NORR.I-BULL TALE.—[CoNcLuDED.1 
They never let no daylight in 
Their dwelling, which you'll say's a 
sin, 
But just like mice they stalk'd about, 
And never show'd their noses out: 
This miserable doleful lot, 
From wuss to wusser daily got, 
Until at last a 
form they plann'd, 
They each should die by their own hand.—Cnoaus. 
The father into the garden did stroll, 
And blow'd out his brains with a 
sausage roll; 
The mother, seeing what he'd done, 
Stabb'd herself with a 
currant bun; 
Soon arter which the oldest boy 
Shot himself with a 
saveloy; 
The youngest daughter, Mary Ann, 
Garotted herself with the frying-pan.—Cuoans. 
The little boy, just turned six, 
Swallow'd a 
gross of flanders bricks; 
John with his life did make away, 
By shooting himself with an old tea-tray; 
The melancholy-visaged groom 
Run himself through with the stable-broom; 
The housemaid into the house did rush, 
And cut her throat with a 
blacking-brush.—Cuo. 
The infant child, just turned two, 
Drowned himself in an Irish stew; 
But one was left, and he, a-lack! 
Hung himself with the roasting-jack; 
The black and white poor tabby-eat, 
Chok'd herself with the street-door mat; 
And a 
fly upon the window pane 
Died of water on the brain.—Cnortus. 
MORAL. 
Now here's a

To fits of hypoeondria; 
Remember life is but a

And live as jolly as you can 
For ain't it now a

see it's made you all turn pale, 
You're frighten'd into fits I

I NEVER SAW A SAW THAT SAWS AS THIS 
SAW SAWS. 
I'm Cheap Jack by trade, and all things I 
have sold, 
Low-priced, and expensive, and novel, and old, 
I've journeyed o'er the Prairies, Rocky Mountains and Vales, 
An. startled the natives with marvelous tales. 
But to-night I've an article I 
want to sell, 
That will suit anyone, I 
can warrant it well, 
This saw I 
can introduce safely, because 
I 
ne'er saw a 
saw saw like this ere saw saws. 
You may have sought a 
saw that saws like this saw saws, 
Or want a 
sort of saw that saws like this saw saws; 
Yon purchase ought a 
saw that saws like this saw saws, 
But you never saw a 
saw that saws like this saw saws. 
Its uses 
run through remarkably quick: 
It can cut its own lucky and cut its own stick, 
To cut along quickly it never has 
And goes faster than ever a 
cutter yet sailed. 
It's assisted full many out fogies when ill, 
To cut off their heir—I 
mean in a 
will— 
It can cut in the light and can cut in the dark, 
And has caused full may a 
cutting remark. 
You may have sought a 
saw, etc. 
Now this very saw—mind, it's truth that I 
tell— 
As-isted in cutting the Suez Canal, 
And it's used, you always distinctly can trace, 
In taking a 
short cut to any known place. 
its used in cutting a 
dozen things more, 
it can cut an acquaintance, a 
dun, or a 
bore, 
And as falsehood my spirit is tonally beneath, 
I 
assure you it's true it can cut its own teeth. 
You may have sought a 
saw, etc. 
Mind, what I 
now tell you is not ajoke, 
'Twill assist you to long cut or short, if you smoke, 
And tho' I've not tried, I 
believe these two facts, 
It's usefol to cut down a 
rate or a 
tax. 
I 
never saw a. saw saw like this saw saws, no! 
Will any one purehase it no \
V, ere I 
go ? 
For, tho' at tho fact perhaps many may scoff, 
This saw is compelling um now to cut off. 
You may have sought a 
saw that saws like this saw saws, 
• 
tr want a 
sort of saw that saws like this saw saws; 
Y011 purchase ought a 
saw that saws like this saw saws, 
But you never saw a 
saw that saws like this saw saws.

0 kind friends I 
hope you'll excuse, 
And ladies pray on me iton't Irown; 
Now this opportunity don't loss. 
For I'm as gallus a 
chap as there is in town. 
0, I 
want a 
sweetheart very bad. 
And perhaps to get her might have a 
bother; 
And the reason why I 
don't mind telling you, 
is for I'm getting too big to seep with my mother. 
C11010.1S. 
So Jiminy Crim'ny I 
don't care, 
So you may laugh and make no bother ; 
I 
want a 
sweetheart, very bail, 
For l'm getting too big to sleep with my mothcr. 
0, in our street there lives a 
divine. 
Next to a 
wood shed in the cellar; 
perfumes her hair and tucks so fine, 
That twenty yards off I'm sure you'd smell her. 
"lother day she sent ine a 
valentine, 
A 
nil in return I 
sent her another ; 
Anil this she wrote on the ladtom, 
"Saying your no use, for you sleep with your mother." 
So Jiminy Criminy, & c. 
0, the other day as T 
walked out, 
I 
was with my girl a 
walking; 
'When a 
chap came up and did her entice, 
Anil they toddled otr together talking. 
I 
jumped up all in a 
crack, 
But my nutwood blow S 
Ile soon did smother; 
And pinned a 
large card to my back, 
Saying there goes the cove that sleeps with his mother. 
So Jiminy Ciiuiiny & c. 
Now there's a 
nice young girl just winked at me, 
Perhaps she wouldn't like to try toe; 
Collie II
, me a 
cuslilin and take some tea, 
For my mother goes out to m 
ash on Friday. 
Alia we will have such a 
precious lot, 
But mind you don't tell it to another ; 
And before you go I'll have you to know, 
That Pm sonic use, though I 
sleep with my mother. 
So Jiminy Crim.ny 
CON DONAHUE. 
In Jersey city there on.ce did dwell, 
A butcher unknown to fame, 
He fell in love with a 
nice young gal, 
And he was not very much for to blame. 
His name it was Con Donahue, 
And her's was Biddy McCord, 
She was daughter-in-law to the soap fat man, 
That lived in the fourteenth ward. 
Now Con he loved her with all his might, 
And he thought she loved him the same, 
He took her to the theatre one benefit night, 
Which caused him all his pain. 
For she saw a 
young man in the pit, 
That did her heart ensnare, 
And she fell in love with his black moustache, 
And curly auburn hair. 
When Con came to hear the news, 
His heart began to falter. 
Says he I 
will go like a 
hero bold, 
And join the sons of Malta. 
But the thoughts of his cold-hearted love, 
Did shortly mark his gills, 
And he killed himself in a 
slaughter house. 
With a 
box of Brandreth's pills. 
I 
have something sweet to tell you but the secret you must keep 
And remember if it isn't right, " I'm talking in my sleep ;" 
For I 
know I 
am not dreaming, 
When I 
think your love is mine ; 
And I 
know they are but seeming, 
All the hopes that round me shine. 
I 
have something sweet to tell you, but the secret you must keep 
And remember if it isn't right, " I'm talking in my sleep." 
So remember when I 
tell you what I 
can no longer keep, 
We are none of us responsible for what we say in sleep. 
My pretty secret's coming I 
- 
Oh I 
listen with your heart, 
And thou shalt hear it humming ; 
Be close, 'twill make you start. 
I 
have something sweet to tell you, but the secret you must keep 
And remember if it isn't right, " l'm talking in my sleep." 
Oh I 
shut your eyes so earnest, or mine will wildly weep. 
I 
love you I 
I 
adore you 
but " I'm talking in may sleep." 
For I 
know I

WHO WILL CARE FOR MICKY NOW 
A 
Parody on; " Who will Caro for Mother Now?" 
Among the ninny heroic fellows who drew a 
prize in the 
U. S. lottery, was a 
distinguished Frenchman— from Limerick— 
the only support of himself. 
On being told by the Surgeon he 
would " Pass," he placed his hand on his empty stomach, and 
while a 
big tear of bravery rolled down his cheek, exclaimed 
in accents that would have touched the heart of a 
wheel-barrow : 
" 
Who will care for Micky now?" 
Arrah ! Molly darlin' I 
am drafted, 
Sure I 
must for a 
auger go; 
An' hive you all alone behind me, 
For to fight the rebel foe— 
But, be the powers ! me pluck is failin', 
Big drops of swate roll down my brow ; 
°ch. juillia murther ! I 
am drafted, 
Who will care for Micky now ? 
CHORM—Soon '
gainst ribels I'll be marching, 
Wid the swate upon me brow— 
Och, bind an' nouns! I'm kilt entirely : 
Who will care fur Micky now ? 
Arrah I 
who will comfort me in sorrow, 
Wid a 
drop of gin or beer; 
Wash me dirty shirts and stockin's ? 
Paix! there's no one, I 
fear— 
Me feet are blistered rid the marching, 
Me knapsack makes me shoulders bow— 
Pork and crackers are me rations; 
Who will care fur Micky now ? 
Soon *gainst ribels, 
Indade I 
miss me feather pirow 
An' bed on which I 
used to lie— 
The pine planks make me feel uneasy, 
If I 
had wines, och ! ivudn't I 
fly 1 
But one ov me legs is stiff, dear, 
Since I 
was kicked be Murphy's cow; 
I'm afraid I 
niver can skedaddle: 
Who will care for Micky now ? 
Soon 'gaiust ribels, 
THE MONKS OF OLD. 
Many have told of the monks of old— 
What a 
saintly rare they were ; 
But tis more true, that a 
merrier crew 
Could not be found elsewhere ; 
For t 
hey sang and laughed, and the rich wines quaffed, 
And lived on the daintiest cheer. 
For they laughed, ha I 
ha I 
and they quaffed ah I 
ab 
And lived on the daintiest cheer. 
And then they would jest at the love confessed 
By many an artless maid, 
And what hopes and fears they had breathed in the ears, 
Of those who had sought their aid 
And they sang aid laughed, and the rich wine quaffed. 
As they told of each lovesick jade. 
For they laughed, ha! ha I 
and they quaffed ah I 
ah I 
And lived on the daintiest cheer. 
And the Abbot meek, with his form so sleek. 
Was the merriest of them all; 
And would take his place with a 
laughing face. 
When refection bell would call ; 
When they sang and laughed, and the rich wine quaffed, 
Till they shook the olden wall, 
And they laughed, ha! ha I 
and they quaffed ah I 
ah ! 
And lived on the daintiest cheer.

TO—LOVE NOT LOVED AGAIN. 
Of all things that are lovely, 
Thou art a ty pe to me! 
Reflecting light and beauty, 
As st,rs Moine the sea. 
Thy image in its brightness 
Is painted on my heart, 
Forever there to linger, 
Till life itself depart. 
Shall Inv true heart he doomed 
To grow all desolate ? 
'Without a 
hope to brighten 
The gloomy will of fate ? 
And must my deep, true passion 
Prove unreturned and vain? 
'Tis life's most bitter anguish 
To love— not loved again.

THE DEVIL AND LITTLE MIKE. 
Oh, ' twas on a 
dusky eve, 
When I 
was very poor, 
My story you may believe, 
The devil he came to the door. 
He had in his fist a 
large book ; 
His eyes did sparkle bright; 
Says he to my sister Suke, 
"I want your brother Mike." 
To my whack, fallal, & c. 
I 
knew his voice in a 
minute, 
I'd heard it times before : 
Then as sprightly as a 
linnet 
I 
flew behind the door. 
His eyes with fire did look, 
He gave a 
most terrible groan, 
Bays Ito my sister Suke, 
" 
Suke, tell him Pin not at home." - 
To my whack, &c. 
The Devil he flew in a 
pet, 
And swore he would come in, 
Says toy big sister Bet,, 
" 
Then I'll vack you out again." 
Be into the house took flight, 
Lord, how he stamp'd and swore, 
When he caught poor little Mike, 
A 
sitting behind the door. 
[I] 
To my whack, & c. 
DEVIL AND LITTLE MIKE. (CoNcLuDx:t.) 
The old woman jump'd off the chair, 
And broke his head with a 
broom, 
The Devil then, out of fear, 
With sulphur fill'd the room. 
'Twas on a 
washing night, 
When the water was boiling hot, 
She gave it him left and right, 
And bundled him into the pot. 
To my whack, &c. 
My little sister Peg, 
She had a 
mighty knack, 
With her father's wooden leg, 
She broke the Devil's back. 
Then he call'd out for his pal, 
As loud as he could shout, 
While, me and my sister Sal, 
Oh, we whack'd the Devil out. 
To my whack, 
Next day the Devil died, 
What glorious news to hear. 
Mark what did him betide, 
He was buried at Bartlemy fair. 
And now, since we've nothing to dread, 
Let your glasses sparkle bright, 
For since the Devil is dead, 
We can all do just as we like.

To my whack, &c.

There's a 
health to the friends that nre far, 
There's a 
health to our friends that are near, 
here's to those who rank first in the war, 
Oh the brave hearts that never knew fear ! 
Here's to him who for freedom first draws, 
And here's to the heart free from guile, 
The patriot friend to his home and his laws, 
Who stands by his own native isle. 
Then hurrah for the Emerald Isle 
And here's to the bosom's bright glow, 
When the banner of liberty waves; 
And here's may she conquer her foe, 
Ere the sons of her glory be slaves 
Then here's to the friends all around, 
The emblem of Erin's rich soul, 
And oh ! may they ever, when wanted, be found 
To stand by their own native isle. 
Then hurrah for the Emerald Isle 
THE VESPER HYMN. 
Hark, the vesper hymn is stealing 
O'er the waters, soft and clear— 
Nearer yet, and nearer pealing, 
Now it bursts upon the ear 
Jubilate,  
Amen. 
Farther now, now farther stealing, 
Soft it fades upon the, ear 
Now, like moonlight waves retreating 
To the shore, it dies along. 
Now like angry surges meeting, 
Breaks the mingled tide of song. 
Hark ! again like waves retreating 
To the shore, it dies along. 
THE YOUNG MAN FROM THE COUNTRY, 
When first I

For Jane that day was busy, and ' twas Margaret's Sunday out ; 
Two silver forks were stole that night, yet no thief did I

No more did that young man from the country that kept com-

That young man, &c. 
He came again and yet again, bow often I 
can't say_ 
And things kept going from the house in quite an awful way ; 
We couldn't tell who took 'em— neither Jane, nor cook, nor me, 
Nor that young man from the country as kept company with 
me. 
That young man, & c. 
One day a 
policeman came for my evidence to give,

An Irishman named Paddy Carey 
Has come to sing for you to- night;

came from a 
town in Tipperary, 
Where we had many 'a fight: 
But the girls and the boys there are witty, 
You can bet your List cent upon that, 
And in my own beautiful city. 
They call me BowId Irish Pat. 
Yes, you can see by the way that I 
talk, 
The shape of my stick and my hat, 
Sober or tight, I'm in for a 
fight, 
Hurra, boys, for Bowld Irish Pat. 
The Saxon of late has been us troblin' 
That's the reason that I 
came away, 
I 
paid my passage down to Dublin, 
And then I 
crossed over the sea; 
When I 
landed sate in this city, 
I 
was Int.t by a 
chap they call 
Who welcomed me to this country, 
Saying, how are you, I3owld Irish Pat. 
Yes, you, can see by the way, &c. 
But I 
like the ways of this country, 
Where a 
man can live by his toi ,, 
And if, he is earnest and patient, 
Ile may soon own a 
bit of the soil ; 
I've bottit a 
fine farm down in jersey, 
And am going to live upon that, 
And if you want to coma and see me, 
You'll be welcomed by BowId Irish Pat. 
Yes, you can see by the way, &c.

Scarcely the vessel's side could lave, 
When on the mizzen-top, his stand 
For clueline taking, spies the land. 
Oh ! sweet reward for all his toil, 
Once more- he views his native soil; 
Once more he thanks indulgent fate 
That brings him safe to bonnie Kate. 
Now high upon the faithful shroud, 
The land that seemed awhile a 
cloud, 
While objects front the mist arise, 
A 
feast presents Tom's longing eyes. 
A ribband near his heart that lay. 
Now see him on his hat display, 
The given signs to show that fate, 
had brought him safe to bonnie Kate. 
Now near a 
cliff whose heights command 
A prospect of the shelly strand. 
He sees his Kate !— his cares are o'er 
The long boat's manned—be jumps ashore; 
What now remains were easy told, 
Toni comes, his pockets lin'd with gold ; 
And now to crown his happy fate, 
He steers to church with bonnie Kate.

Ah! what a 
fate, for with a

And with one stroke, what have I 
done ? 
Broken her nose ; yes, altogether, 
Her lovely nose— a charming one. 
What is the face if it hasn't this feature ?— 
Giving her brow such an air of repose ; 
Losing it now, what magician can teach her, 
How to repair such a 
beautiful nose ! 
Oh, how sad ! 
Ali ! alt ! 
I've broken the nose, the nose, the nose of the Princess, 
I've broken the nose, the nose, the nose, the nose of the

I've broken the nose, I've broken the nose of the Princess 
so fair! 
What a 
sad blow, oh, eould I 
mend it? 
How would I 
work, sticking it on!

Quick as a 
wink, this face should don ! 
What would I 
give if I 
only could find one

Tell me, oh, tell me, now, is there no kind one, 
Willing to patch up a 
beautiful nose ?

PETER POTTS THE PEELER.—[CONCLUDED] 
You'll often find me, when 'tis cold, 
A-standing down an area, 
All my brave deeds I 
then unfold, 
To Betsy, Jane, or Mary; 
I 
fancies as I 
knows my " book" 
Right bang up to the letter, 
I'm most attentive to a 
cook, 
'Cos with them I 
fares better.—Cuoaus. 
I, by the cooks, could be well fed, 
But as I'm not a 
glutton. 
For a" snack," I 
eats a 
loaf of bread, 
And a 
couple o' pounds of mutton! 
My appetite's so werry queer, 
( 
You see that, without question) 
That about a 
couple o' pots o' beer 
I 
drink, to aid digestion.—Cnoaus. 
A 
secret I 
to you will tell 
'Cos 'twill be in safe keeping, 
I 
likes to find a 
drunken swell 
Upon a 
doorstep sleeping; 
I 
rushes up with staff in hand, 
And takes good care to floor him, 
Then swears as he's too drunk to stand, 
And—minds his money for him.—Cuoaus. 
That all our men a 
watch can boast, 
Is quite a 
matter of course, sirs I 
If they don't get one, in a 
mouth at most, 
We turns 'em o o' the force, sirs : 
And often, too, in their first week, 
They finds a 
chap " in liquor, " 
And it only wants a 
little cheek 
To be master of a " ticker."—Cuoaus. 
Folks often greet me with abuse, 
I 
very sarsy find 'em, 
They holler out, " Who stole the goose ?" 
But, lor I 
I 
never mind 'ern, 
That I 
for goose and rabbit pie, 
Have got a 
special liking, 
I 
gives 'em a 
proof, when them I'm nigh, 
In a 
manner rather striking.—Cuoaus.

Drooping eyes, like summer skies, 
Like any maid, as if afraid;

But never your hand must touch her! 
Or she will vanish through your fingers!
