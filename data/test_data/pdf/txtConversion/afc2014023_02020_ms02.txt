Jay begins by providing identification information: Jay Cudd, 2008 N. St, 
BR, LA 70802; 
ebenistewoodworks.com. He says that "ebeniste" is French for 
"woodworker" He was born in Alexandria Louisiana, on - 1964. 
He has lived in Louisiana all his life, with the exceptionof oneyear and a 
half in Santa Fe. He bel i 
eves that his spirituality ( not religion) comes 
through in his work with a "feeling" that hetri es to evoke. 
3:40 
He got started in woodworking a 
pproximately23 years ago, in Baton 
Rouge, when he asked for help with a 
flat ti re at a 
woodworkers shop. 
He was fascinated and began "hounding [the owner] for aj ob" unti I 
he 
was hired. The owner's shop focused on building rusticfurniture. He 
stayed there l%years, until he opened his own shop. Heaccepted 
whatever work he was offered, and I 
earned by researching at the LSU 
library, and workingbytrial and error. 
6:33 
His first boss worked on basic rusti cfurniture and used only pine and 
cypress. Throughthe years, Jay got more i 
nterestedi nfi ne furniture, 
which required acquiring newtools.

"Big dining tables" were particularly challenging to build fromscratch: 
"how thick or tall to make the stretcher or the apron to support along 
top" His expertadvicecamefrom "the LSU library." He began to study 
how to restore a 
nd conserve period, a 
ntique furniture ea rly on. 
8:35 
He is particularly interested i 
n 
the techni que called "French water 
gilding" He describes the process as follows: You makeup a 
certain king 
of gesso; it's a 
mixtu re of pl aster a 
nd high glue. And you mi x 
a 
certain 
ratio, and you pile that overthe ca ruing. It's kind of a 
slip, it's kind of 
watery, and you paint on a 
few coats. And you go back and hand sand all 
thatrea I 
ly smooth. And thatends upbeinga baseforwhat's called a 
bowl, whi ch i 
s 
a 
clay, which a 
Iso ha s 
kind of a 
high glue mixed in with it. 
So you paint the cl ayonto that, kind of sand it down a 
little bit, a 
ndget it 
really supers mooch. You let i 
t 
dry, and then when you get ready to put 
your gold leaf on, you re-wet itwith distilled watera ndjust a 
little bit of 
denatured alcohol. You rewet the clay, it reignites the hi gh-glue inside 
the clay, and makes it moist, and that's youra dhesive. After the glue is 
doneyouwaitti11 the clayis about 75%to 85% dry. If you're in a 
pottery 
class they teachyou howto burnish claydown, itgivesa really shinylook 
to it.That's ba sicallywhat you do, you're kind of burnishing—alotof 
people think you're shining, polishing the gold, but you're bumishingthe 
clay underneaththegold, and itgivesita superhigh luster. And they 
usedthata longtime ago when there was noel ectricity; they had 
candles, chandeliers, a 
lotof gilded gold and silver. They givethat a 
really 
high polish to reflectas muchl ightas possible." Historically, the process 
was both decorative andfunctional.

Jay describes the process of shellacking: "You startwith dried shellac. 
And you want to get what's called de-waxed shellac. It has a 
natural wax 
in it, and they run it through a 
process to get a 
I 
I 
the wax out. It comes in 
dried flakes. And you start off with what's called a 
two-pound cut, and 
that's a 
two pounds of shellac to a 
gallon of denatured alcohol. And 
there are other a 
I 
cohols you can mix in with it, a 
ccordingto what the 
weather's I 
i 
ke. The humidity, you might want to add isopropyl alcohol, so 
it does n't—wel 
I, I'm getting ahead of myself. So you have to mix the 
shellac with denatured alcohol, and dissolve, it'll weigh about twelve 
ounces once it's dissolved. And you start with kind of a 
50:50 rati oof 
each. Its kind of thick. And that goes onto bare wood, if you ha ve ba re 
wood Iikethat. You do that for about three to five coats. And you put it 
down with what's called a 
rubber or a 
mouse. And it's a 
ball of shredded 
cotton, or cotton wool, and you wadi  up and squeeze it down to the 
size of an egg. And then you wrap that in some thin cotton, and you put 
another piece of larger cotton around it, to make this pad. You twist it 
up, and then you kind of flatten it down a 
little bit to make a 
shape, and 
then you open it backup and pour that two pound cut of shellac inside of 
it. Then you wad it backup, put it down, and then you do swirls, you do 
straight lines, and the  
rubbing alcohol dries superfast.... So that's why 
you have to go quick. You can't stop, or it makes a 
mark. So you keep 
going, and after about three or five coats of that, the pad starts to stick 
to the shel I 
ac. You have to wait about five to ten minutes to let that sit. 
And you can also use an oil. You can flicker on some olive oil, or linseed 
oil and so forth. That separates the shellac from the previous, what 
you'veputon. It's kind ofa burnishing effect. When you're applying the 
next coat, it's also burnishing the previous coat. So you're polishing as 
you're applying it. So as you're building up thefi nish, you're diluting your 
cut of shellac  
at the s 
ame 
ti me. And you can end up putting, say, eighty 
or n 
i 
n 
ety coa ts. I 
t 
goes on super,  
superthin."

The end of the shel lacking process res ults i 
n 
a 
bout 100 coats, with the 
coating getting progressively thinner. Jayconsidersit "an art form" He 
describes the sheen as begin very"organic;' as not having"a plastic 
look." 
1:19 
He has done the Japanese lacquering process several times, though not 
recently. He follows akmostthesame procedure astheshellacking 
process. He occasionally paints on designs. HemostlydoesFrench 
polishing. 
2:36 
As for custom-built furniture that he designs, he says that "he Iikesto 
have fun," even to the point of being non-functional. Hewantsan 
ordinary piece to take people "away from the mundane." He 
occa sionallyworks in the style of George Na kashima, a 
Ja panese-
American furniture buildingof the 1950s. The hea rtof the process is 
"I ea vi ng the natural edge on the boards"

Jay has built  a 
mock-up of a 
custom-designed to ble i 
n 
the style of George 
Nakashima. He used poplar wood—"Idnd of a 
waste wood"—to "see 
certainlines." He based the lines of thelegon thecurveof a 
samurai 
sword. For thefi nished product, he plans to re-do the based with maple. 
The top of the to bl a 
wi II be el m, in a 
butterscotch finish. 
5:57 
To make thetable, Jay useda table sawforthe square blocks and legs, 
and  bandsawtocutthecurves. Hehastousea band saw, a 
joiner, 
planers, profilers, and other handtools to fi 
nishthe product. 
6:21 
The pl a 
ners and profilers (a 
ka profiles) are hand-toolsto shape and 
replicate bea dworka nd moldings. Sometimes he makes his own profilers 
out of old saw blades gi ven to him by a 
sawmill worker i 
n 
W 
alker, 
Louisiana. Some period antiques have very unique designs, depending 
on the tools of the original woodworker, solayfabricates profilers to 
repl i 
cate the period design. When he doesn't fabricate his own tools, he 
buys them on I 
i 
ne, either new or used. He pa rticularly goes to Ebay for 
used tools. If used, he refurbishes thetool by, for example, replicating 
the ha ndle, to restore its use. 
8:46 
Jay describes the process of fabricating profiles:"I justtakea pieceof 
wood, a 
nd ma ke a 
s 
lot down mostly half of it, stick a 
piece of meta I 
through that s 
lot, and on the other side of it I'd put a 
screw and a 
bolt to 
tighten thatslotagainstthe piece ofmetal I 
put inthere, the profiled 
metal.Andl'd make it really supers hallowto start my bead, andscrape 
away the wood until there's no more wood there, loosen my bolt, to p 
the pi ece of metal down slightly, and then tighten it backup, go back and 
take more wood until it's done and just keep going further and further 
and further until my profile's there." He says it is typical for 
woodworkers to fa bricate ma nyof thei r 
own tools. 
9:41 
At the ti me of the i 
ntervi ew, he was fa bricating a "thi ckness drum 
sander"35 inches wide. Hedescribesitasacylinderturnedbya motor, 
with Vel cro a 
round the cylinder, a

cylinder. [photo #84] He plans to build a 
dust-collection system above 
the cylinder by building a "little box wi th two ports, and the hoses come 
off of those ports to vacuum" 
10:34 
As for other "work-hazard prevention," he does not wea r 
loose-fitting 
clothes. Heparticuladywouldn'twearatie! Hedoes wearhis rings, 
even though he says hes houldn't. He's "j 
ustvery careful." Hehas 
i 
nj ured himself only once in 20-something years of woodworking, nicking 
hisfinger. The i 
njuryrequired grafting skinto thefi nger, so the injury

Jay describes a 
jig, which is a 
tool to guide a 
nothertool to create precise 
shapes. For example,"if you wanted to scoop outa chair seat,you can 
makea jig outof certain shapes of plywood. Andyoucanmakethe 
router run along certain shapes." Some woodworkers put a 
lot of effort 
into their toolmaking: they "wi I 
I 
make a 
nice [tool] out of really nice 
hardwood, put some carving in it, and make a 
nice little brass pl ate down 
there that holds things a 
lot better than wood." Toolmaking is part of 
the woodworker's craft. They can be so well crafted that they become 
a 
rt obj ects. 
14:04 
As for an "excel lent product," he s 
a 
ys that it "comes form a 
lot of 
experience." He has seen antiques comethrough his shop that he "can't 
even i 
magi ne replicating" because of thei rexcellent craftsmanship. He 
describes woodworking guilds—"LouisXIV & XV type stufr—where 
different workers worked specifically on different tasks. Astandardof 
excel Ience is knowing what good work"looks like, what it  nvolves, and 
wha t 
i 
t 
enta i 
Is."

JAY CUDD 
1:14 
As for how bei ng i 
n 
Baton Rouge has affected his work, Jay believes that 
the rich history in antiques in the South. He describes books written 
about Louisiana furniture, in particular, on theAcadian-French style and 
the "certain types of joinery methods thatseem unique to the first 
woodworkers in New Orleans." Armoires may, for example, have small 
cabriolefeet. Not much of the furniture exists today. 
4:31 
Jaycameto Baton Rougetogoto LSU to major inanthropology. Hedid 
notfi nish his degree. He stayed in Baton Rouge, but he doesn't believe 
the city necessarily provides the quantity of work he would like to have. 
`It kind of fluctuates with the economy," he says. He leftfor Santa Fefor 
a 
1 %Zyears for marriage, but returned to Louisiana when the marriage 
ended. 
6:47 
Young people approach him for apprenticeships, but he says that he's 
never"been in the position to afford that, really." Heisveryparticularin 
his work, and has no desire to try to teach itto someone else. He 
doesn't seethe kind of work he does as a 
thriving tradition. Fewofhis 
kind exist,hebelieves. He has found"two or three" people in Louisiana 
who do the kind of restorationof antiques that he does. In particular, he 
takes pride in his abilitytodo French polishing, whichisnotgafish 
because he does not brush it on. Hedoesn'tknowofanyoneelsein 
Louisiana who does French polishing. He has seen manyvaluable 
antiques devalued because of shoddy restoration work by "spraying 
lacquer on it"to make something "look good." He points outthat 
"restoration is different from conservation," which is focused on cleaning, 
and housing old furniture. 
11:29 
He does not see himself as focusingon one ki nd of woodworking only. 
He does traditional and modern furniture building, as well as restoration 
andconservation. He won't doIearnerworkortextiles, strictly wood.

He has worked so much with Louisiana cypress and pine that he says hers 
"tire of working" wi ththese materials. Hesays they are not "good 
structural wood forfu rniture" because the wood is too brittle and soft 
for "real lythicklegs." His favorite woods to work with are walnut and, 
especially, cherry, because of its strength, color variation, and ability to 
to ke a 
fi ni sh. If he gets a 
nice quality piece of wood, he doesn't nee to 
stainit. 
13:55 
To get his wood, he orders it from different places—a 
lot from Ebay. He 
looks and the grain of pieces, and if he likes the wood, he'll havethe 
sel l 
erwet it with mineral spirits to "see what i 
t 
would lookl ike with a 
finishonit" if helikes it, he'll order itand haveitwithin 3-7days. 
14:38 
Jay grew up in"timber country," in Central Louisiana. He says there's no 
enough to "commercially harvest" i nthat area, so it is mostly used for 
housing bea rns and paper products. 
PART4 
JAY CLIDD 
0:15 
When asked what he va lues most a 
bout what he does, he says its that 
he's I 
earned about historically correct finishes, and how to apply gold 
and silver finishes for "a 
certain look." Heis particularly proudofhis 
gesso work and learning about the h 
i 
story of it. 
1:03 
He separates himself from a 
cademically trained conservationists, who 
are very concerned about "rules and regulations" and whi ch would limit 
his work with too many restrictions. He says there's a"big divide" 
between "conservationists" and "restorationists" in America, asopposed 
to Europe. Hedoesgetworkfrom museums sub outto him, from 
conservationists who aren't trained in his techniques. 
3:44 
In Santa Fe, he fou nd a 
community of other woodworkers, where 
craftspeople helped each other out. In Baton Rouge, its "waydifferent" 
in that its more competitive and craftspeople seem more protective of 
theirwork. Hemissesthecommunityof Santa Fe. "Thatsthewayit 
should be."
