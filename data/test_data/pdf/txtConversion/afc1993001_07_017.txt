From e
arly April t
hrough mid-May of 1
982, I
 d
id f
ield research on the s
ub-
ject of Jewish education a
t West End Synagogue, in Nashville, Tennessee.  My
 
project was part of a
 national s
urvey of ethnic l
anguage and heritage schools;
 
t
he work was under t
he s
ponsorship of the American Folklife Center.  My charge
 
was t
o provide an e
thnographic overview of a religious school a
ssociated with
 
o
ne of Nashville' s
 Jewish synagogues.  In order t
o do s
o, my rsks included
 
s
electing a religious s
chool, making a
 number of s
ite visits a
s a
 participant-
o
bserver, c
ompleting a
 number of ethnographic interviews with representative
 
participants (
administrators, parents, and students), and gathering d
ocumentary
 
materials r
anging from s
ample c
urricular materials (
if available) t
o photo-
graphs.  The processed f
ield materials, which include l
ogged tape recordings,
 
f
ield notes, published materials, and photographs, will be deposited at the
 
Library of C
ongress, where the Folklife C
enter i
s l
ocated, and t
hose materials
 
will be available f
or future research.  This f
inal report i
s intended a
s an
 
overview, an accoun
t of my research and f
indings a
s well a
s an o
pportunity f
or
 
preliminary interpretation of what I f
ound.
 
Jews make up a t
iny percentage of t
he t
otal population of the South, but
 
Nashville, l
ike many other Southern c
ities, does have a l
ively, t
ightly-kni
t
 
Jewish c
ommunity.  There are an e
stimated 3
600 Jewish residents there, and
 
even after very preliminary f
ieldwork i
t i
s c
learly a
ccurate t
o u
se t
he t
erm
 
"corm
iunity" t
o describe the c
omplex s
ocial relationships which bind t
hose 3
600
 
people t
ogether.  Jewish education i
s one of t
he major c
omponents of t
he
 
c
ement in which those bonds a
re s
et.
 
Jewish c
ommunities are typically well organized, with s
ynagogues and a

or organizations.  Education i
s u
sually, although not a
lways, t
he proveni-
ence of the synagogues; at t
imes, t
he l
ay organizations will include support
 
groups f
or education.  In Nashville, t
here are t
hree c
ongregations, each
 
with i
ts house of worship and i
ts a
ssociated s
chool.  The t
hree most c
ommon
 
of American J
iid   
s
in's f
our movements are represented.
 
Sherith I

s on West End Avenue.  An
 
orthodox Hebrew day s
chool--a Jewish parochial s
chool which carbines t
he ortho-
d
ox t

nstruction in secular s
ubjects--shares the building with
 
Sherith I

chool i

ew blocks west of the orthodox house of worship, West End Synagogue
 
i
s the c
ommunity' s c
onservative i
nstitution.  The synagogue s
ponsors a religious
 
s
chool which c
onvenes both after s

and on Sunday mornings.  The Te

I chose t
o f
ocus on Jewish education a
t West End Synagogue f
or s
everal
 
reasons.  The c
onservative movement in J
iid i  si
n i
s g
enerally thought of a
s a
 
middl e ground between t
he strict devotion of orthodoxy and t
he more a
ss1ini-
l
ationist s
tance of the reform movement.  The c
onservative movement i

he t
raditions of Judi
  
Sm yet adjusting t
o the d
emands made
 
by l
ife in c

or s

sm has c
oncen-
t
rated on keeping a
live much of the Jewish religious
 
t
radition, including i
ts c
ustoms, c
eremonies and
 
f

S
 
One reason f
or my choice, t
hen, was an intellectual  one, the question
 
of the relationship of e
thnic education and a sense of t
radition which i
s
 
praiulgated on a
 notion of process rather than stasis, a
 viewpoint which
 
accepts the fact of acculturation but not at the price of a
ssimilation or
 
t
he d
e-emphasis of t
radition.
 
A second re
on was both personal and pragma
tic.  Until the age of
 
thirteen, I
 was educated by a c
onservative s
chool in a
 Northern s
uburban area.
 
Although no l
onger actively involved in any i
nstitutional a
spect of J
i
idai
  
sm,
 
I f
elt t
hat what remained of my i
nsider's cultural knowl

particularly in c
onsideration of t
he brief t
ime available f
or t
he f

researc
l
 
A t
hird r
eason was purely pragmatic.  After t
elephone c
onversations with
 
people active in Nashville's Jewish c
ommunity i
t seemed l
ikely t
hat West End
 
Synagogue--its s
chool administration, rabbi, and c
ongregants--would be
 
amenable t
o being involved in t
he research.  They were.

I.  The F
ieldwork
 
My f
ieldwork c
ommenced just a
s Passover was a
bout t
o begin.  An e
ight-day
 
holiday during which religious s
chool i
s c
ancelled, Passover i
s o
bserved with
 
Feintuch-
 -
4
 
ritual meals called s
eders.  My f
irst physical c
ontact with the West End
 
c
ongregation was a seder a
t Rabbi Melvin Glazer' s
 house.  After s
ome prelÂ±nin-
ary t
elephone c
onversations with a
 mnber of t
he s
ynagogue, I decided t
o phone
 
Rabbi Glazer in order t
o g
ain official entry t
o the s
ynagogue.  Rabbi Glazer
 
rninded me that Passover was t
o begin t
hat evening and invited my wife and
 
me t
o the seder t
hat f
ollowing evening.  The seder, then, was my f
irst access,
 
a rii   t
o meet the young r
abbi and his f
amily and t
o talk briefly a
bout t
he
 
project.
 
On R
abbi Glazer' s advice I t
elephoned Miriam Halachmi, t
he s
ynagogue's
 
Education Director.  She a
sked t
hat I s
end her s
omething in writing a
bout t
he
 
project s
o t
hat she c
ould present i
t t
o t
he lay carinittee which governs t
he
 
s
chool.  I
t was not necessary, she f
elt, f
or me t
o meet with the c
omnittee.
 
She a
sked that I call back a
 week l
ater, when she had had a c
hance t
o meet
 
with the c
ommittee and when s
chool was back in session.  Not wanting me t
o
 
visit t
he school without her having had the c
hance t
o brief her t
eachers,
 
a
sked that I
 wait until the week f
ollowing the f
irst session after Passover.
 
In the meantime, realizing that Passover i
s not a
 holiday in which a
ll
 
secular activities are affected, I
 began t
o set up interviews with parents
 
of s
tudents.  Because of t
he delay caused by the holiday, I
 had visited and
 
interviewed t
wo parents before I s
et f
oot in t
he s
chool.  The f
irst, S
andy
 
Averbuch, has a daughter preparing f
or her bat mitzvah at West End's religious
 
school.  In a
ddition, though, a
ll of her children attend Akiva, the Hebrew
 
day s
chool.  Sandy, a l
ife-long Nashvillian and a graduate of the West End
 
s
chool, chairs the day s
chool.  Very a
ctive in the Jewish c
ommunity, she
 
describes herself a
s a "
c.reer volunteer."

My s
econd interviewee, Hedy Pollack, has a daughter e
nrolled in the t
hird
 
grade at West End S
ynagogue.  Hedy a
lso c
urrently t
eaches on Sundays f
or t
he
 
s
chool.  In the past, she has c
haired the s
ynagogue's education c
oninittee.
 
In the f
ollowing week I
 made nr f
irst visit t
o the s
ynagogue, where I
 
interviewed Miriam Halachmi and began sitting in on c
lasses.  I
 made a t
otal
 
of s
ix s
ite visits.  School was in session on f
ive of those visits; c
onsequently
 
I
 had the opportunity t
o observe a r
ange of c
lasses and t
eachers along wit
 
o
ther a
spects of the school.  I interviewed Sharon Beck, another t
eacher, betore
 
c
lass and tape-recorded her c
lass.  With Bob Gates, a
 photographer and f
olklore
 
graduate student, I attended a S
unday parents' visitation day.  With nj wife,
 
Maxene, a
 public s
chool t
eacher, I devoted a Sunday t
o o
bserving the older
 
s
tudents in c
lass and interviewed Mark Levine, a t
enth grade s
tudent many f
eel
 
t
o be a
 nod a
l of what the school ought t
o accomplish.  I
 had the opportunity
 
t
o s
peak c
asually with many other students and teachers.  I also made an informal
 
evaluation of, and d
id s
ome research in, the synagogue l
ibrary.  After s
chool
 
one Sunday, I
 visited and interviewed Robert Workman, father of two s
tudents.
 
My f
inal visit t
o the s
ite was on a
 Wednesday, when s
chool was not in s
ession.
 
At t
hat t
i m
a, I interviewed R
abbi G
lazer and s
pent a f
inal s
ession with Miriam
 
Halachmi.
 
On a
 personal note, I
 might add t
hat f
or ma t
his was particularly interesting
 
f
ieldwork because Jewish c
onrnur
iities t

In 1
902, the congregation had erected a
 building, the Gay Street Synagogue.
 
By 1
947, the congregation decided t
o t
rove t

onsequently,
 
t
hey moved t
o an existing building at 3
810 West End Avenue.  Four years after that,
 
the main section of the current West End Synagogue structure opened i
ts d

on that site.  In 1
959, a f
undraising drive began f
or the purpose of building
 
a religious school wing t

IV.  Jewish Education at West End Synagogue
  
Structure
  
Religious school c
onsists of t
wo c
omponents.  Hebrew school nets on Tues-
day and Thursday afternoons from 4

chool has approximately 1
50 students t
his
 
year.  The 1
981-82 academic year ran from September 1
3 t
hrough May 2

Age and secular s

Pre-school a

e s s e p a r at e  c
lasses f o r  t
hree-ye r-o1ds and
 
f
our-year-olds.  From kindergarten through eleventh grade, students a
re
 
grouped into c
lasses on the basis of their grade l
evel in s
ecular school.  Thus,
 
a f
ifth grade student in secular school would be in the f
ifth grade at religious
 
school.  S
ixth and seventh grades are co
mbined.  As a result, there a
re
 
t
hirteen s

lass l

Teaching Staff
  
About twenty adults t
each in v
arious capacities.  Miriam Halachmi, R
abbi
 
Glazer, and t
he c
antor each do s
ome teaching, a
s d
oes Donna Glazer, t
he rabbi '
s
 
wife.  In addition, the s
ynagogue a
lso employs a s
taff of salaried part-time
 
teachers.  According t
o Miriam, the s
chool f
ormerly c
onsidered its own graduates
 
t
o be qualified t
o i
nstruct, but in recent years t
here has been an attempt t
o
 
hire t
eachers who have both a
 background in J
ilrinism
. and (
secular) t
eaching
 
c
ertification.  All but t
hree of the t
eachers--the rabbi, c
antor, and e
leventh
 
grade t
eacher--are women.
 
The religious s
chool catalog c
ontains brief d
escriptions of the qualifica-
t
ions of most, but not all, teachers.  The r
ange of academic qualifications
 
include:  M
. S
. candidate, Educational P
sychology, Vanderbilt; B
. S
., Art Educa-
t
ion; B
.A., French Literature, Columbia, and B

srael.
 
The emphasis on credentials i
s reflective of a
 national concern in Jewish
 
education. 5 Considering the t
raditional education orientation of the
 
American Jewish c
ommunity, it i
s hardly surprising t
o f
ind t
hat emphasis.
 
Most of the t
eachers d
o not hold other employment.  Teachers are paid
 
according t
o experience and credentials.  Not all t
eachers are c
onservative
 
Jews.  S
haron Beck, f
or example, i
s orthodox, and she has had t
o reconcile her

The c
urriculum at West End Synagogue i
s c
ler
n-ly designed t
o impart t
o the
 
s
tudents a sense of their Jewishness.  O
stensibly, the United Synagogue of
 
America, the conservative movement's national l
ay organization, sets c
ertain
 
minimal s
tandards f
or education in schools s
ponsored by conservative syna-
gogues, and the individual s
chools then play a
 major role in the determination
 
of t
heir curricula.  West End, f
or example, offers s
ix hours of s
chool a
 week,
 
f
ollowing the d
ictates of United Synagogue.  On the other hand, the s
chool has
 
set its particular c
urricular priorities, and i
t i
s the s
chool--primarily Miriam
 
Halachmi-
 -
which choses i
ts textbooks.
 
I
t i
s s
ignificant, though, that according t
o Rabbi Glazer religious
 
school at his i
nstitution i
s more s
imilar t
han dissimilar t
o religious s
chools
 
at other c
onservative congregations.  Having served in a
 number of other
 
c
ongregations, and r
emaining in t
ouch with his rabbinical c
olleagues t
hrough
 
t
elephone c
onversations and conventions, the rabbi f
eels t
hat he i
s g
enerally

chools a
ssume.  Miriam i
s newer
 
t
o c
onservative education and therefore i
s less generally f
amiliar with o
ther
 
s
chools.  She attributes the basic s
imilarity between c
onservative s
chools,
 
which exists without s
ubstantial c
entral guidance, t
o the fact that t
he vast
 
majority of c
onservative rabbis, many s
chool a
dministrators, and even quite a
 
f
ew t
eachers receive t
heir education at the major c
onservative s

Jewish Theological S

Of s

tudents are most

S
 
curricular priorities.  Rabbi Glazer, on the other hand, articulated a
 more
 
general set of goals f
or the curriculum:
 
We have to get kids to understand some notion of history,
 
where we've come from; some notion of who we are now, which
 
means I
srael; some notion of our religious attitudes, which
 
means prayer services and liturgy and holidays and
 
life-cycle events.  We have to talk about Jewish values
 
because there i
s a Jewish way of looking at the world, and we
 
have to try to get our kids to understand the difference and
 
try to t
urn them towards looking at the world Jewishly.  That's
 
perhaps the most difficult thing of all .
 .
Miriam, then, has been faced with the task of establishing a set of
 
How do  these priorities and goals translate into specific course offerings?
 
For the pre-school through first grade students, the curriculum is intendeu
 
according to the school catalog, "

Students and their Parents
  
Students attend religious school at West End Synagogue on a t
uition basis.
 
At $
60 annually per student, the t
uition c
overs approximately a quarter of the

 The balance i
s made up from the synagogue's general f
unds.
 
Scholarships, determined on the basis of need, are available.  Only t

ues are a
ssessed on a s
liding
 
s
cale pegged t

I
t i
s a t
ruism that the smaller t
he Jewi
sh c
ommunity, the higher the per-
centage of c
hildren who are e
nrolled in religious s
chool.  West End's e
nroll-
merit reflects t
hat t
rend.  Rabbi Glazer says there are a
bout 2
00 s
chool-age
 
c
hildren in the c
ongregation; at the start of the 1
981-82 s
chool year, 1
50 were
 
e
nrolled.  Ninety-two percent of Nashville's Jews are affiliated with one of
 
t
he t
hree synagogues.
 
Why are the s
tudents e
nrolled?  This q
uestion i
s difficult t
o a
nswer with
 
s
tatistical precision.  The answer, though, seems t
o involve two s
imple--
and related--facts.  First, most of the s
tudents I s
poke t
o began religious
 
s
chool because of their parents' desire t
hat they d
o s
o.  The majority of
 
the students s

evel, at an age in which

If s
on
ie s
tudents dislike religious school, others respect it.  Sane of the
 
older students--and nDst s
tudents d
o c
ontinue beyond their bar/bat mitzvahs--
share their parents' a
ssessment of t
he importance of participating in the
 
experience of being a Jew.  Religious school, then, becomes t
he vehicle by
 
which they explore and c
one t
o a
ppreciate their heritage.
 
In the Jewish Network
  
Because Jewish cann
ix
iities are u
sually highly organized, i should make
 
brief mention of the fact t
hat religious s
chool i
s part of a c
omplex organ-
i
zational network.  Of particular significance, f
or i
nstance, i
s t
hat there
 
are a
 number of Jewish youth organizations which involve the students.  The
 
synagogue s
ponsors I
J
SY, United Synagogue Youth.  There are other f
raternal and
 
s
ororal organizations which draw students f
rom a
ll t
hree religious schools.
 
The Jewish C
ormunity C
enter s
ponsors a range of youth activities and
 
provides recreational facilities.  The JCC runs a s
ummer day c
amp.  S
ome
 
parents s

amps elsewhere.  At West End
 
Synagogue, a

s
uccessfully s
urveyed itself.  A c
opy of t
he results, the Nashville Family

Few of the teachers participate in educators' organizations.  On t
he
 
other hand, Miriam, S

V
.  O
bservations on t
he Process of Cultural Transmission
 
S
 
The s
ingle most important fact which emerges after my f
ield reser
n-ch i
s
 
that school at West End Synagogue exists t
o impart a strong s
ense of Jewish
 
i
dentity t
o its students.  Almost without regard t
o the c
ontent of any s
pecifi
 
c
ourse or even t
he c
urricular priorities, the s
chool c
onstitutes a structure
 
which f
ormally transmits and reinforces that s
ense of i
dentity, t
hat "Jewishness."
 
Every person--administrator, t
eacher, parent, or student--with whom I s
poke
 
agreed on the necessity of understanding one's Jewishness.  On that point,
 
a
 number of s
ignificant themes became a
pparent.
 
you want t
hem t
o know where they c
ame from and why i
s i
t important
  
t
o keep on being a
 Jew."
 
Echoing Miriam Halachmi' s statement, a
bove, S
haron Beck said that s
chool
 
ought ".
 .  .  t
o t
each Jews what it i
s t
o be Jewish and why they should be
 
Jewish, and t
o t

t

radition, t
he c
omponents of which underlie a '

understanding of who he or she i

see, this premium placed on i
dentity supercedes even t
he emphasis on matters
 
purely religious.

a c

he words of one informant, J

s "a heavy
 
burden."  Religious school attempt
s t
o provide the important historical and
 
theological basis for c
omprehending the "otherness" of Je
ws in America and
 
elsewhere.  On that point, R
abbi Glazer s

 It goes beyond religion, because you
 
can be a good Jew without being religious.  I
 would rather say
 
t

Resisting Assimilation
  
Too mach a
ssimilation, it i
s thought, destroys Jewishness.  School, there-
f
ore, i
s of importance for providing a balance to the tendancy toward
,a&Â§imi-
lation.  It does so in at least two ways.  First, and most obvious, it
 
transmits ideas and information about the distinctiveness of Judaism.  Second,
 
and perhaps equally important, it compels Jewish children to socialize with other
 
Jews.  Suburbanization has diffused the community in Nashville; religious
 
school at West End exposes the students to significant Jewish role models, and
 
it makes available a pool of Jewish age-mates, potential friends.
 
In adrii  
tion, the school sometimes faces the i
ssue of assiniLlation head-on.
 
For example, this year it sponsored a high school retreat in the synagogue.
 
The focus of the program
. was a presentation by a Jew who had joined and latc
 
renounced a cult.  She essentially told the students how to deflect the
 
recruiting tactics used by cults.  Another example i
s the elective course,
 
"How to Answer," which is.concerned with how to deal with evangelical
 
Rejecting out of Knowledge
  
There i
s a great e
uphasis on rationality and a premium
. on learning for its
 
own s
ake in conservative Judaism.  A number of informants told me that even if

not t

erms
 
of ritual o

o we have
 
an a

i

t i
s t

i
s a shared responsibility.  I
 prefer t

t d
ifferently.  To ma, t
his
 
s
ituaion c
learly i
llustrates the contention t
hat Jewishness and Jewish religious
 
devotion are not one and the same.  Families may not practice religious ritual
 
a
t home.  They may not attend services at the s
ynagogue.  But they continue t
o
 
s
end their children t
o s
chool at the synagogue, in my e
stimation because they
 
value their Jewishness a
bove and beyond the devotional a
spects of their c
ulture.
 
I
t can be of great importance t

Final Report to the American Folklife Center

 Introduction
 
From early April through mid-May of 1
982, I did field research on
 
the subject of Jewish education at West End Synagogue in Nashville,
 
Tennessee.
 My project was part of a national survey of ethnic language
 
and heritage schools; the work was under the sponsorship of the American
 
Folklife Center.  My charge was to provide an ethnographic overview of a
 
religious school associated with one of Nashville's synagogues.
 In
 
order to do so, my tasks included selecting a religious school, making a
 
number of site visits as a participant-observer, completing a number of
 
interviews with representative participants (
administrators, parents,
 
and s
tudenrs), and gathering documentary materials ranging from sample
 
curricular materials to photographs.
 The processed field materials,
 
ich include logged tape recordings, field notes, school publications,
 
xtbooks, and photographs are on deposit at American Folklife Center at
 
the Library of Congress, where those materials are available for future
 
research.
 This report is an overview, an account of my research and
 
findings as well as an opportunity for preliminary interpretation of
 
what I found.
 
Jews make up a tiny percentage of the total population of the
 
South, but Nashville, like many other Southern cities, does have a
 
lively, tightly-knit Jewish community.  An estimated 3600 Jews are
 
Nashvillians, and even after very preliminary fieldwork it is clearly
 
accurate to use the term "community" to describe the complex social
 
relationships which bind those 3600 people together.
 Jewish education
 
is one of the major components of the cement in which those bonds are
 
set.
 
Feintuch--2
 
Jewish communities are typically well organized, with synagogues
 
and a network of lay organizations serving as the significant ethnic
 
institutions or organizations.
 Education is usually, although not
 
always, the provenience of the synagogues; at times the lay organiza-
tions include support groups for education.
 In Nashville there are
 
three congregations, each with its house of worship and its associated
 
school.
 The three most common of American Judaism's four movements are
 
represented.
 
Sherith Israel, the Orthodox synagogue, is on West End Avenue.  An
 
Orthodox Hebrew day school--a Jewish parochial school which combines the
 
Orthodox tradition with instruction in secular subjects--shares the
 
building with Sherith Israel, although the school is administratively
 
separate from the synagogue.  A few blocks west of the Orthodox house of
 
worship, West End Synagogue is the community's Conservative institution.
 
The synagogue sponsors a religious school which convenes after
 
school--on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons--and on Sunday mornings.
 The
 
Temple, representing the Reform movement, is on Harding Road, in an area
 
called Belle Meade, a mile or two west of the Conservative and Orthodox
 
synagogues.
 Religious school at The Temple meets once a week, on the
 
weekend.
 
I chose to focus on Jewish education at West End Synagogue for
 
several reasons.  The Conservative movement in Judaism is generally
 
thought of as middle ground between the strict devotion of Orthodoxy and
 
the more assimilationist stance of the Reform Movement.  The Conserva-
tive movement is seen as maintaining the traditions of Judaism yet
 
adjusting to the demands made by life in contemporary American culture.
 
Feintuch--3
 
A textbook written for secondary students in Conservative schools
 
describes the movement as follows:
 
Conservative Judaism stresses the element of historical continuity.
 
Conservatism stresses that traditions have helped hold the Jews
 
together.
 It believes that strict following of old customs is not
 
good, but it believes in a living tradition which changes according
 
to the needs of the time.  Therefore Conservative Judaism has
 
concentrated on keeping alive much of the Jewish religious tradition,
 
including its customs, ceremonies and folklore. 1 
One reason for my choice, then, was an intellectual one, the ques-
tion of the relationship between ethnic education and a sense of tradi-
tion which is promulgated on a notion of process rather than stasis, a
 
viewpoint which accepts the fact of acculturation but not at the price
 
of assimilation or the de-emphasis of tradition.  A second reason was
 
both personal and pragmatic.  Until the age of thirteen I spent six
 
hours a week in a Conservative school in the suburbs of Philadelphia.
 
Although no longer involved in any institutional aspect of Judaism, I
 
felt that what remained of my insider's cultural knowledge could be of
 
use, particularly in consideration of the brief time available for the
 
field research. 2 A third reason was purely pragmatic.  After telephone
 
conversations with people active in Nashville's Jewish community it
 
seemed likely that West End Synagogue--its school administration, rabbi,
 
and congregants--would be amenable to being involved in the research.
 
Indeed, they were.
 
liI IT
 
My fieldwork commenced just as Passover was beginning.
 An
 
eight-day holiday during which religious school is cancelled, Passover
 
is observed with ritual meals called seders.
 My first physical contact
 
with the West
 
house.  After
 
the synagogue
 
End congregation was a seder at Rabbi Melvin Glazer's
 
some preliminary telephone conversations with a member of
 
I decided to phone Rabbi Glazer in an attempt t
o gain
 
official entry to the synagogue.
 
Rabbi Glazer reminded me that Passover
 
Feintuch---5
 
mitzvah at West End's religious school.
 In addition, though, all of her
 
children attend Akiva, the Hebrew day school.  A life-long Nashvillian
 
and a graduate of the West End school, Sandy chairs the Orthodox day
 
school.  Very active in the Jewish community, she is a self-described
 
"career volunteer."  My second interviewee, Hedy Pollack, has a daughter
 
in the third grade at West End Synagogue.  Hedy also currently teaches
 
on Sundays for the school.
 She is a former chair of the synagogue's
 
education committee.
 
In the following week I made my first visit to the synagogue, where
 
I interviewed Miriam Halachmi and began sitting in on classes.
 I made a
 
total of six site visits.
 School was in session on five of those
 
visits; consequently I had the opportunity to observe a range of classes
 
and teachers along with other aspects of the school.
 I interviewed
 
Sharon Beck, another teacher, before class and tape-recorded her class.
 
With Bob Gates, a photographer and folklore graduate student, I attended
 
a Sunday visitation day for parents of pre-schoolers.  With my wife,
 
Maxene, a public school teacher, I devoted a Sunday to observing the
 
older students in class and interviewed a tenth grade student whom many
 
feel is a model of what the school ought to accomplish.
 I had the
 
opportunity to speak casually with many other students and teachers.
 I
 
also made an informal evaluation of the synagogue library and used it
 
for some historical research.  After school one Sunday I visited and
 
interviewed Robert Workman, father of two students.  My final visit to
 
the synagogue was on a Wednesday when school was not in session.  That
 
day I interviewed Rabbi Glazer and spent a final session with Miriam
 
Halachmi.
 
On a personal note I might add that this was particularly inter-
e
sting fieldwork because Jewish communities tend to differ in several
 
significant ways from the other c
ommunities in which I have worked.
 I
 
have done field research in various ethnic communities and in a number
 
of regional cultures.  American Jews are statistically among the best
 
educated and most affluent groups in the United States.  My informants
 
were all well educated and conversant to more than an average extent
 
with the academic world.  Some were familiar with the discipline of
 
folklore--one has a brother who i
s a folklorist, another studied with a
 
prominent folklorist, and yet another has some familiarity with studies
 
in Jewish folklore.  The notion of "
the field" as an "other" place--a
 
s
till sometimes visible holdover from our disciplinary past--simply is
 
not relevant here.  Not only could I gather information from my resource
 
people, but I could also discuss interpretations and their c

demographic data at their fingertips.  Needless to say, in my role as
 
fieldworker I was also asked some challenging questions.

 In fact, American Jews have a well established tradition of

was eventually to become West End Synagogue.  The name they gave that
 
congregation, Khal Kodesh Adath Israel (
Congregation Assembly of
 
Israel), is still part of West End's full title.
 
In 1886 the congregation bought its first house of worship, a
 
former residence.  A member, Mamie Stravinsky, established the first
 
Sunday school in 1
896.  Two year later, the American Israelite announced
 
that "On March 8
, the Purim Play was presented to a large audience by
 
members of the K
.K.A.I. Sunday School. ,
5  By 1924 the synagogue's Board
 
of Education had divided into two committees, one for the Sunday school,
 
the other for the weekday Hebrew school, providing us with evidence that
 
Sunday school had been joined by weekday afternoon school as early as
 
then.  Around that same year classes moved to the YMEA building which
 
had more classrooms.  Enrollment was approximately fifty students.
 
In 1902 the congregation erected a building, the Gay Street Syn-
agogue.  By 1947 the congregation decided to move to a large facility.
 
Consequently they moved to an existing building at 3810 West End Avenue.
 
Four years after that, the main section of the current West End Syn-
agogue structure opened its doors on that site.
 In 1959 a fundraising
 
drive began for the purpose of building a religious school wing to be
 
added to the synagogue.  The opening of the fund drive included the
 
statement that "Religious education is the foundation of Judaism."  The
 
U-shaped wing was completed in 1961.
 
Today West End Synagogue is a well maintained dark brick building
 
located on a four-lane busy city artery traversing what appears to be an
 
established upper-middle-class neighborhood.  Within walking distance
 
are the Jewish Community Center and Sherith Israel, the Orthodox syna-
gogue.  That section of West End Avenue is also the site of a number of
 
Feintuch--8
 
substantial churches and a Bible college.
 Rabbi Glazer and his family
 
live in a house, recently built by the congregation, directly behind the
 
synagogue.
 
The synagogue itself has about 500 member families.
 It is governed
 
by a lay board and administered by the Rabbi, a cantor, and the Educa-
tion Director.  At the time of my research the cantor was preparing to
 
leave for a position elsewhere, and the synagogue was going through the
 
process of seeking a replacement.
 Support staff includes secretaries, a
 
kitchen supervisor, and custodians.  There are, of course, a number of
 
teachers.
 The synagogue has a range of facilities, including two or
 
three halls of worship, a large social hail, and offices for the three
 
salaried professionals.
 In addition, there is a school office, kitchen,
 
library, and at least twelve classrooms.  Parking areas border the
 
building on both ends and to the rear.
 
IV.  Jewish Education at West End Synagogue
  
Structure
  
Religious school has two components.  Hebrew school meets on
 
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons from 4
:10 until 5
:40.
 Sunday school
 
convenes at 9 a
.m. and runs until noon.
 Students can begin religious
 
school at three years of age; for those who continue through the full
 
program a graduation ceremony marks the conclusion of the eleventh
 
grade.
 The school has approximately 1
50 students this year.  The
 
1
981-82 academic year ran from September 13 though May 23.  There is no
 
summer school.
 
M E

O
 
Age and secular school grade determine religious school grade
 
level.  Pre-school at the synagogue includes separate classes f
or
 
three-year-olds and four-year-olds.  From kindergarten through eleventh
 
grade, students are grouped into classes on the basis of their grade
 
level in secular school.  Thus, a fifth grade student in secular school
 
would be in the fifth grade at religious school.  Six and seventh grades
 
are combined.  As a result, there are thirteen separate class levels,
 
counting pre-school.
 
Pre-school though first grade students attend school on Sundays
 
only.
 S
tudents in the eighth through tenth grades do the same.  Second
 
graders attend on Sundays and Tuesdays, in apparent preparation for the
 
full three-day-a week schedule for grades three through seven.  Many
 
schools associated with the Conservative movement end after tenth grade
 
with a confirmation ceremony for the students.  At West End an effort is
 
made to keep the students a year longer, hence the graduation ceremony
 
at the end of the eleventh grade.  There is no confirmation. Eleventh
 
grade students attend on alternate Sundays only.
 
Once they reach the second grade students begin to change classes
 
and t
eachers during each day's session.
 Sundays have three fifty-five
 
minute periods with breaks in between.  Weekdays have two forty minute
 
classes.
 Each class period features a separate subject taught by a
 
t
eacher who specializes in the topic.
 
Administration
  
A fifteen member lay Education Committee oversees the s
chool.
 
Composed largely of parents who have children enrolled in religious
 
school, the committee meets.regularly.  Members serve two year terms.
 
Feintuch--1O
 
Miriam Halachmi is the school's full-time salaried Education Director.
 
An Israeli, educated in both her native country and the United States,
 
she has a background in education and counseling.
 Currently in her
 
third year as director, she had previously taught at Akiva, Nashville's
 
Hebrew day school.
 
When Miriam began at West End the position was defined as
 
half-time, but that soon changed.
 She works Mondays, Tuesdays, Thurs-
days, Fridays (
until the Sabbath begins at sundown), and Sunday morn-
ings, typically putting in more than forty hours a week.
 In addition,
 
she usually attends Shabbat (
Sabbath) services because the school
 
expects her students to attend.
 She works eleven months a year.
 
According to her job description, Miriam's responsibilities include
 
hiring and training teachers; curriculum development; public relations;
 
holiday and Shabbat programming; supervision of school building and
 
equipment; problem solving; ordering supplies and A-V equipment; liason
 
with youth organizations; reporting to the religious school committee;
 
teaching religious school; working with other professionals, which
 
includes weekly meetings with the Rabbi and cantor; setting school
 
policy; school administration; participation in adult Jewish education
 
(Rabbi Glazer is teaching occasional adult classes this year); mainte-
nance of school records; and enrollment and placement of students.  As
 
one of the synagogue's three salaried professionals, Miriam directs
 
virtually every aspect of religious school.
 
Rabbi Glazer is also involved in education at the synagogue,
 
although not in the same ways as Miriam.  He says,
 
You may call me the executive educator.  That's really how I see the
 
Feintuch--11
 
role of the rabbi.
 The rabbi's an educator, and I function as such
 
through my own teaching--that is, I have adult classes as well as
 
teaching classes in the religious school.
 I teach a class, the bar
 
and bat mitzvah class.  .
 .
 .
 In addition, I supervise, although not
 
very tightly, our Education Director on the assumption that the goals
 
are shared by both of us and it's her school.  And yet we meet
 
together pretty much daily to talk about goals and programming and
 
ideas and problems.
 So I keep my finger on what's going on in the
 
school while not interfering in the day to day operation.
 
Teaching Staff
  
About twenty adults teach in various capacities.  Miriam Halachmi,
 
Rabbi Glazer, and the cantor each do some teaching, as does Donna
 
Glazer, the Rabbi's wife.
 In addition, the synagogue employs a staff of
 
salaried part-time teachers.  According to Miriam, the school formerly
 
considered its own graduates to be qualified to instruct, but in recent
 
years there has been an attempt to hire teachers who have not only a
 
background in Judaism but also (
secular) teaching certification.  All
 
but three of the teachers--the Rabbi, cantor, and eleventh grade
 
teacher--are women.
 
The religious school catalog contains brief descriptions of the
 
qualifications of most, but not all, teachers.  The range of academic
 
qualifications include: M.S candidate, Educational Psychology,
 
Vanderbilt; B.S., Art Education; B
.A., French Literature, Columbia, and
 
B
.H.L., Jewish Theological Seminary; and a degree in Jewish Philosophy
 
from Haifa University, Israel.  The emphasis on credentials is reflec-
tive of a nation concern in Jewish education. 6 Considering the American
 
Feintuch--12
 
Jewish community's traditional orientation t
oward education, it  is
 
hardly surprising to find that emphasis.
 
Most of the teachers do not hold other employment.
 Teachers are
 
paid according to experience and credentials.  Not all teachers are
 
Conservative Jews.
 Sharon Beck, for example, is Orthodox.
 She has had
 
to reconcile her own beliefs with the tenets of the Conservative move-
ment.  Art and music teachers, who supplement the primary teachers for
 
the lower grades, need not be Jewish.
 The
 
manual as well as an annual school catalog.
 
I was impressed by the caliber of the teaching I observed.
 Every
 
teacher seemed knowledgeable.
 They were generally casual and friendly,
 
most showing good rapport with the students.
 
Curriculum and Curricular Materials
  
The curriculum at West End Synagogue is clearly designed to impart
 
to the students a sense of their Jewishness.  Ostensibly, the United
 
Synagogues of America, the Conservative movement's national lay organi-
zation, sets certain minimal standards for education in schools spon-
sored by Conservative synagogues, and the individual schools then play a
 
major role in the determination of their curricula.  West End, for
 
example, offers six hours of school a week, following the dictates of
 
United Synagogues.
 On the other hand, the school has set its particular
 
curricular priorities, and it is the school--primarily Miriam
 
Halachmi--which choses its textbooks.
 
It is significant, though, that according to Rabbi Glazer religious
 
school at his institution is more similar than dissimilar to religious
 
schools at other Conservative synagogue.  Having served a number of
 
Feintuch--13
 
other congregations, and remaining in touch with his rabbinical col-
leagues through telephone conversations and conventions, the Rabbi feels
 
that he is generally familiar with the various shapes religious schools
 
assume.  Miriam is newer to Conservative education and therefore is less
 
generally familiar with other schools.
 She attributes the basic simi-
larity between Conservative schools, which exists without substantial
 
central guidance, to the fact that the vast majority of Conservative
 
rabbis, many school administrators, and even quite a few teachers
 
receive their education at the major Conservative seminary, the Jewish
 
Theological Seminary in New York.
 
Of setting a curriculum for the middle grades, when students are
 
most involved in the school, Miriam says,
 
When you make a curriculum, first of all you have to make your
 
priorities.  We have major areas--prayer, Hebrew, Jewish Studies,
 
ethics, and history.
 So you have to make your priorities because you
 
have six hours a week, and you can't teach everything.  The parents
 
would have liked us to, but we can't.
 So I guess that we took as our
 
priority for the middle grades the prayers.
 So Hebrew is taught so
 
that the kids will be fluent when they get to the prayerbook, that
 
they won't have problems reading.
 If we have time, we teach them
 
some spoken Hebrew, but the stress is really Hebrew in translation.
 
Prayer eventually leads to the child being able to conduct a Friday
 
night service.  .
 .
 
Prayer is, then, the foundation.  Here I want to interject the
 
observation that members of the Jewish community in the United States
 
Feintuch--14
 
distinguish their ethnicity on the basis of a shared religious heritage
 
and its concomitant cultural history rather than in terms of national
 
origins.
 It therefore stands to reason that the core of an educational
 
process which is designed to inculcate the students with a sense of
 
cultural identity would in this case focus on shared ritual and belief
 
systems.
 
The emphasis on prayer intensifies in the year preceeding the
 
students' bar or bat mitzvahs, the ritual attainment of adulthood in a
 
person's thirteenth year.  Miriam feels that after the bar/bat mitzvah
 
the students should study more history.  History, in Miriam's--and the
 
school's--view, encompasses Biblical history at one end and modern
 
Jewish-American history and Zionism at the other.
 
Miriam, then, has been faced with the task of establishing a set of
 
curricular priorities.  Rabbi Glazer, on the other hand, articulated a
 
more general set of goals for the curriculum.
 
We have to get kids to understand some notion of history, where we've
 
come from; some notion of who we are now, which means Israel; some
 
notion of our religious attitudes, which means prayer services and
 
liturgy and holidays and life-cycle events.  We have to talk about
 
Jewish values because there is a Jewish way of looking at the world,
 
and we have to try to get our kids to understand the difference and
 
try to turn them towards looking at the world Jewishly.  That's
 
perhaps the most difficult thing of all.  .
 .
 
How do these priorities and goals translate into specific course
 
offerings?  For the pre-school through first grade students, the
 
Feintuch-- 1
5
 
curriculum is intended, according to the school catalog, " .
 .
 .
 to
 
provide an initial exposure to Judaism which will be both fun and
 
informative."  By the end of first grade, students should have rudimen-
tary Hebrew reading abilities.
 In those early years, students also have
 
art and music classes.
 
From second through seventh grade, the curriculum is compart-
mentalized.
 Students have separate teachers for each of three
 
classes--Prayer, Hebrew, and Jewish Studies.  To that, the sixth and
 
seventh graders add a class in specific preparation for bar/bat mitz-
vahs.
 In sum, the middle years are devoted to achieving a degree of
 
competence in religious ritual, including familiarity (
although not
 
conversational skills) with the liturgical language; to familiarizing
 
students with the cycle of holidays; to instilling a basic set of
 
values; and to introducing Biblical history.
 
In eighth, ninth, and tenth grades, the emphasis shifts to socio-
cultural studies.  Required courses differ from grade to grade, with
 
s
tudents in the three grades also choosing electives which they share.
 
Eighth grade classes are "The Early Prophets" and "The Jews of America."
 
In the ninth grade, the students take "Milestones in the Life of a Jew"
 
(
which includes traditional rites of passage and issues such as dating
 
non-Jews and premarital sex) and "Highlights of Jewish History."  Tenth
 
grade students enroll in a class in rabbinic civilization; they also
 
take "The Development of the Four Religious Movements" for half the year
 
and "The Zionist Movement and the Palestinian Issue" for the balance of
 
the year.
 Electives in the 1981-82 school year included a class on how
 
to deal with evangelical Christians and other missionaries, a course in
 
traditional ethics, a study of the role of women in traditional and
 
Feintuch-- 1
6
 
contemporary Judaism, and "High School Bowl," patterned on the "College
 
Bowl" television competitions.  Eleventh grade students have no set
 
curriculum.
 Their teacher is listed as a "facilitator," and they take a
 
topical, discussion-oriented approach which they themselves determine.
 
There is no dearth of textbooks or other curricular materials for
 
Jewish schools.  A number of publishers specialize in textbooks for such
 
schools.  At West End, Miriam buys most frequently from Behrman House,
 
in New York.
 She also uses the catalogs of KTAV and Torah l
jmesorah,
 
both of which are also in New York.
 SAFRA, a regular journal, provides
 
her with reviews of new curricular materials.  Publishers' catalogs
 
suggest appropriate grade levels for specific titles.
 The school also
 
has a collection of filmstrips and other A-V materials.
 
I saw a variety of textbook formats.
 Some are straightforward
 
histories.
 Others, particularly those for prayer or Hebrew, are work-
books.  The "Milestones" class uses a set of short modules, each focus-
ing on a relevant topic.  Many of the books have gone into a number of
 
printings.
 Some provide teachers' editions.  Cabinets in each classroom
 
hold the textbooks when students are not using them.
 Students do not
 
ly take their books home, which is indicative of the trend not to
 
:c  homework--in recognition of the teachers' realistic expectations.
 
The school has been conservative about changing texts because of the
 
costs involved.  The religious school catalog contains a full list of
 
texts used in each course.
 
Students and their Parents
  
Students attend religious school at West End Synagogue on a tuition
 
basis.  At $60 annually per student, the tuition covers approximately a
 
Feintuch--17
 
quarter of the actual cost.
 The balance comes from the synagogue's
 
general funds derived for the most part from membership dues which are
 
assessed on a sliding scale pegged to income.  Only the children of
 
synagogue members can attend.
 Scholarships, determined o
n  the basis of
 
need, are available.
 
It is a truism that the smaller the Jewish community, the higher
 
the percentage of children who are enrolled in religious school.  West
 
End's enrollment reflects that trend.  Rabbi Glazer says there are about
 
200 school-age children in the congregation; at the start of the 1981-82
 
school year 150 were enrolled.  Ninety-two percent of Nashville's Jews
 
are affiliated with one of the three synagogues according to the Rabbi.
 
Why are the students enrolled?  This question is difficult to
 
answer with statistical precision.  The answer seems to involve two
 
simple, and related, facts.
 First, most of the students I spoke to
 
began religious school because of their parents' desire that they do so.
 
The majority of the students start religious school at the pre-school
 
level, at an age in which they could hardly be expected to make the
 
decision to enroll.  So, generally speaking, the decision to attend
 
religious school is not the child's.  The second fact is that the school
 
teaches cultural identity and that a sense of ethnicity is of great
 
importance to American Jews.
 On the basis of my preliminary fieldwork,
 
it is clear that parents wish their children to have that sense of
 
Jewishness, even above and beyond the matter of religiosity.
 I will add
 
the observation that religious school is often a family tradition.
 
Parents are quite likely to have gone to Hebrew school; most of the
 
current students will probably send their own children when the time
 
comes.

Do the students enjoy religious school?
 Interestingly, most of the
 
adults I queried said "No" emphatically.
 In that regard, one
 
teacher-parent said, "They hate it; that's how they feel, the same way I
 
felt when I was going.  They despise it."  Another teacher said,
 
"They're pretty negative about coming to Hebrew school."  Rabbi Glazer
 
spoke facetiously about using "guns and whips" to compel the students to
 
attend.  Adults, then, tend to feel it imperative that children attend,
 
but they view the children as unwilling participants.
 
Students, though, vary in their feelings about religious school.
 I
 
encountered a range of opinions, from those which plainly illustrated
 
the adults' contentions to those which valued the experience for several
 
reasons.
 The younger students--pre-bar/bat mitzvah--often seem to
 
resent the time they must put into religious school, yet many seem to
 
enjoy the social aspects of the experience.
 At religious school they
 
see friends whom they would not see in secular school.
 In fact, some
 
very strong friendships are made in religious school, something valued
 
by many adults who feel that their children should have at least some
 
Jewish friends.
 
If some students dislike religious school, others respect it.
 Some
 
of the older students--and most students do continue beyond their
 
bar/bat mitzvahs--share their parents' assessment of the importance of
 
participating in the experience of being a Jew.  Religious school, then,
 
becomes the vehicle by which they explore and come to appreciate their
 
heritage.
 
In the Jewish Network
 
Fejntuch---19
 
Because Jewish communities are usually highly organized, I should
 
make brief mention of the fact that religious school is part of a
 
complex organizational network. 8 Of particular significance is that
 
there are a number of Jewish youth organizations which involve the
 
students.
 The synagogue sponsors t
ISY, United Synagogue Youth.  There
 
are other fraternal and sororal organizations which draw students from
 
all three religious schools.
 The Jewish Community Center sponsors a
 
range of youth activities and provides recreational facilities, and it
 
also runs a summer day camp.
 Some parents send their children to Jewish
 
summer camps elsewhere, a number of the West End parents sending their
 
children to Camp Ramah, in Wisconsin.
 
Few of the teachers participate in educators' organizations.
 On
 
the other hand, Miriam, Sharon Beck, and Rabbi Glazer attended a nation-
al conference last year sponsored by an organization called the Coali-
tion on Alternatives in Jewish Education.
 
We cannot, then, view the religious school at West End Synagogue in
 
isolation.
 A more complete study would necessarily examine the school
 
in relation to the broader organizational scheme of the Jewish community
 
in Nashville and in the nation.
 
V
.  Observations on the Process of Cultural Transmission
  
The single most important fact which emerges after my field re-
search is that school at West End Synagogue exists to impart a strong
 
sense of Jewish identity to its students.  Almost without regard to the
 
content of any specific course or even the curricular priorities, the
 
school constitutes a structure which formally transmits and reinforces
 
that s
ense of identity, that "Jewishness."  Every person--administrator,
 
t
eacher, parent, or student--with whom I s
poke agreed on the necessity
 
of understanding one's Jewishness.  On that point, a number of signifi-
cant themes became apparent.
 
. . . you want them to know where they came from and why is it
 
-
  
-
. . to teach Jews what it is to be Jewish and why they
 
should be Jewish, and to try and keep them t
o be Jewish." I
t i
s the
 
s
chool's job, then, to teach the Jewish
 
which underlie a person's understanding
 
in terms of ethnicity.  As we will see,
 
supercedes even the emphasis on matters
 
tradition, the components of
 
of whom he or she i
s, at least
 
this premium placed on identity
 
purely religious.
 
"
I think it's difficult to be Jewish."
 
A recurring theme
-was that Jews are a distinctive group and that in
 
a largely non-Jewish world it is necessary to band together, both to
 
perpetuate a culture which is of great value and to
 
a world which is at times hostile.  During the civil
 
ville's Jewish Community Center was bombed.
 In the words of one inter-
viewee, Judaism is "a heavy burden."  Religious school attempts to
 
provide the important historical and theological basis for comprehending
 
the "
otherness" of Jews in America and elsewhere.
 On that point, Rabbi
 
Glazer said,
 
I
f you answer the question, "What i
s Judaism?" then you know what
 
you should be teaching.  And for me, Judaism is a multi-faceted
 
Feintuch--2 1
 
conglomeration; it's an organism.
 I call it a civilization.
 
It goes beyond religion, because you can be a good Jew without being
 
religious.
 I would rather way that we Jews have a civilization
 
all of our own.  We have our own liturgy, we have our own calendar,
 
we have our own state, we have our own literature, we have our own
 
laws, we have our own holy days, we have our own language.
 
We're really a civilization, and so, from my standpoint, to be a Jew
 
means to plug in to whatever part of that civilization appeals to you
 
and makes sense to you.
 
The Necessity of Hebrew
  
English is the first language of virtually all the West End con-
gregants.
 
Yet, West
 
prayer is
 
Hebrew is not a conversational language for American Jews.
 
End Synagogue places considerable emphasis on Hebrew.
 If
 
the foundation of the curriculum, Hebrew is the means by which
 
one traditionally prays.  There is only one course in conversational
 
Hebrew.  The assumption seems to be that Hebrew, as a lai
 
worship, is at the core of Jewishness.
 One should know
 
have the ability to translate.  The school teaches no Yiddish; the
 
younger generations seem to feel no need for it.
 
Resisting Assimilation
  
Too much assimilation, it is thought, destroys Jewishness.  School,
 
therefore, is of importance for providing a balance to the tendency
 
toward assimilation.
 It does so in at least two ways.  First, and most
 
obvious, it transmits ideas and information about the distinctiveness of
 
Judaism.
 Second, and perhapsâequally important, it compels Jewish
 
Feintuch---22
 
children to socialize with other Jews.
 Suburbanizatiori has diffused the
 
community in Nashville; religious school at West End exposes students to
 
significant Jewish role models, and it makes available a pool of Jewish
 
age-mates, potential friends.
 
The school sometimes faces the issue of assimilation head-on.
 For
 
example, this year it sponsored a high school retreat in the synagogue.
 
The focus of the program was a presentation by a Jew who had joined and
 
later renounced a cult.
 Essentially, she told the students how to
 
deflect cultists' recruiting tactics.  Another example is the elective
 
course, "How to Answer," which is concerned with how to cope with
 
evangelical Christians.
 
Rejecting out of Knowledge
  
There is a great emphasis on rationality and a premium on learning
 
for its own sake in Conservative Judaism.  A number of informants told
 
me that even if a person rejects his or her Jewishness, religious school
 
is crucial because it allows one to make the decision based on knowledge
 
rather than ignorance.
 
The Home-School Partnership
  
Both Miriam Halachmi and Rabbi Glazer feel that in order to accom-
plish the school's goals it is necessary that the students' homelife
 
reflect and reinforce what the school does.
 If school is intended to
 
teach Jewishness, it is imperative that family life be Jewish as well.
 
At the visitation day for parents of pre-school students both the Rabbi
 
and Miriam spoke about that subject to the assembled parents, saying
 
that a partnership is required in order for the school to be effective.
 
Feintuch--23
 
Rabbi Glazer, though, thinks that in many cases the partnership is
 
not realized.
 At one point he said to me.
 
â¢
 .
 .
 we operate in a vacuum in a sense, because they go home after
 
they leave here.  We only see them six hours a week.  And the homes
 
that they go back to are for the most part Jewishly dry and
 
unobservant and nonpious.  That's not to say they're not caring--they
 
are caring--but in terms of ritual observance, synagogue attendance,
 
personal study habits, there's usually very little.  And so we have
 
an additional burden that we have to come up against, and that is
 
what happens to the kids when they go home.  We talk about a
 
partnership all the time with the parents, but I know very well that
 
the kid's Jewish education he's going to get here.
 
In the same vein, Miriam said, "We say we can give information.  We
 
cannot teach commitment.
 
So if the families are not doing some-
thing to keep the kids Jewish, I don't think we can do the jobs our-
selves."
 
The dissonance between the school professionals' emphasis on the
 
importance of homelife and their disappointed perceptions of the reality
 
is even more striking when viewed against the fact that the majority of
 
parents do send their children to religious school.  One way to inter-
pret this is to suggest that parents tend to feel i
t
 
responsibility to do what the school believes is a
 
bility.
 I prefer to view it differently.  To me, this situation clearly
 
illustrates the contention that Jewishness and Jewish religious devotion
 
are not one and the same.
 
âFamilies may not practice religious ritual at
 
Feintuch---24
 
home.  They may not attend services at the synagogue.
 But they continue
 
to send their children to school at the synagogue in my estimation
 
because they value their Jewishness above and beyond the devotional
 
aspects of their culture.
 It can be of great importance to identify
 
oneself as a Jew and to move comfortably in the culture even if you do
 
not practice the religious ritual.  Again, then, school is important
 
because it teaches Jewishness, and Jewishness is not synonomous with
 
religiosity.
 
VI.
 Suggestions for Additional Research
  
It has barely been possible to scratch the surface during this
 
project.
 Ideally, research would follow the school through a full
 
academic year.  Regular visits spread out over a year would make it
 
possible to see students learn and to get a much better understanding of
 
process.  A year's research would include participation in special
 
events such as holiday programs, bar/bat mitzvahs, and USY-sponsored
 
programs.
 In addition, for the findings to be anything more than
 
preliminary and speculative it would be necessary to interview a wider
 
sample of the students, teachers, and parents as well as to do follow-up
 
interviews with key participants.
 
I have pointed out, too, that religious school at West End is part
 
of a Jewish network.  For a more complete understanding of the school,
 
it would help to have the opportunity to study the network itself.
 
Finally, Nashville is an ideal city for a broader study of the way   
which Jewish community schools function.  The three most common forms of
 
American Judaism are represented, each by one school.
 In that respect,
 
Feintuch--
--25
 
the city contains a microcosm of American Judaism.
 Preliminary research
 
is complete in one of the three schools.
 It would be worthwhile to
 
broaden and complete the study by moving from the focus on one school to
 
a consideration of a community and its schools.
 
According to the literature, Jewish education at West End Synagogue
 
is, in its structure, administration, and curriculum, typical of schools
 
associated with Conservative synagogues.9  As to the school's spirit and
 
other, less tangible domains, it is difficult to speak of typicality.
 
came way from my all too brief encounter with the school feeling that I
 
had seen high spirits and strong dedication and an emphasis on pro-
fessionalism, all of which manifested themselves in an ambience which is
 
humane and in a school which is in large measure quite a success.  One
 
of my Nashville interviewees, a parent who had grown up in larger Jewish
 
communities in the North, told me that in medical school his Jewish
 
roommate " .
 .
 .  came from I think Omaha, Nebraska, or something.
 
Probably a Jewish community the same size as Nashville.  And I thought
 
he had a fantastic Jewish education, and I couldn't understand how a
 
small city could have educated him so well.  But I understand it now."

EST END SYNAGOGUE SCHOOL
 
Nashville, Tennessee
 
Final Report by Burt Feintuch
 
Jews make up a t
iny percentage of the' -t
otal population o
f t
he South, but
 
Nashville, like many other Southern cities, does have a lively, t
ightly knit
 
Jewish c
ommunity. An e
stimated 3
,600 Jews live in Nashville. Even after very
 
preliminary fieldwork, i
t i
s clearly accurate to use the term "
community" to
 
describe t
he c
omplex social relationships which b
ind those 3
,600 people
 
together. Jewish education i
s one o
f the major components of the c
ement in
 
which t
hose b
onds are s
et.
 
Jewish c
ommunities a
re t
ypically well organized, with synagogues and a
 
network o
f lay organizations serving a
s the significant ethnic institutions or
 
organizations. Education i
s usually, although not a
lways, the province of the
 
synagogues; a
t times the lay organizations include support groups for
 
education. In Nashville there are t
hree congregations, each with i
ts house o
f
 
worship and its associated school, and three o
f American Judaism's four
 
movements are r
epresented.

I chose to focus on Jewish education at West End Synagogue for several
 
reasons. The Conservative movement in Judaism i
s generally thought of as
 
occupying the middle ground between the strict devotion of Orthodoxy and the
 
more assimilationist stance of the Reform Movement. The Conservative Movement
 
is seen as maintaining the traditions of Judaism, yet adjusting to the demands
 
made by life in contemporary American culture. A textbook written for secondary
 
students in Conservative schools describes the movement as follows:
 
Conservative Judaism stresses the element of historical
 
continuity. Conservatism stresses that traditions have
 
helped hold the Jews together. It believes that strict
 
following of old customs is not good, but i
t believes in a
 
living tradition which changes according to the needs of
 
the time. Therefore Conservative Judaism has concentrated
 
on keeping alive much of the Jewish religious tradition,
 
including its customs,  c
eremonies and folklore .
\
1 /
 
One reason for my choice, then, was an intellectual one âthe question of
 
the relationship between ethnic education and a sense of tradition which is
 
promulgated on a notion of process rather than stasis; a viewpoint which
 
accepts the fact of acculturation but not at the price of assimilation or the
 
deâemphasis of tradition. A second reason was both personal and pragmatic.
 
Until the age of thirteen I spent six hours a week in a Conservative school in
 
the suburbs of Philadelphia. Although no longer involved in any institutional
 
aspect of Judaism, I felt that what remained of my insider's cultural knowledge
 
could be of use, particularly in consideration of the brief time available for
 
the field research.\ ,,A third reason was purely pragmatic. After telephone
 
conversations with people active in Nashville's Jewish community it seemed
 
likely that West End Synagogue--its school administration, rabbi, and
 
congregants âwould be amenable to being involved in the research.

The Synagogue
 
In 1
974 West End Synagogue published its centennial history 
.
\ /A permanent
 
Jewish community in Nashville actually dates to about 1850, however \,,
/ y 1871
 
there were three synagogues, and the Jewish population of the city was roughly
 
what it is today, if expressed as a percentage of the city's total population.
 
Twenty families organized the congregation which was eventually t
o become West
 
End Synagogue in 1874. The name they gave that congregation, Khal Kodesh Adath
 
Israel (Congregation Assembly of Israel), is still part of West End's full
 
title.
 
In 1
886 the congregation bought i
ts first house of worship, a former
 
residence. Mamie Stravinsky, a member of the congregation, established the
 
first Sunday school in 1896. Two years later the American Israelite announced,
 
"On March 8
, the Purim Play was presented to a large audience by members of the
 
KKAI [Khal Kodesh Adath Israel] Sunday School.'k5i3y 1924 the synagogue's Board
 
of Education had divided into two committees, one for the Sunday school, the
 
other for the weekday Hebrew school, evidence that Sunday school had already
 
been joined by weekday afternoon school. At about the same time classes moved
 
to the
' YMI
-IA building, which had more c
lassrooms. Enrollment was approximately
 
fifty students.
 
In 1
902 the congregation erected a building--the Gay  Street Synagogue.
 
By 1947 the congregation decided to move to a larger facility and chose an
 
existing building at 3810 West End Avenue. Four years later the main section of
 
the current West End Synagogue structure opened its doors on that site. A
 
4
 
fund-raising drive began in 1959 for the purpose of adding a religious school
 
wing to the synagogue. One statement used in the fund drive was "Religious
 
education is the foundation of Judaism.' The U-shaped wing was completed in
 
1961.
 
Vest End Synagogue i
s a well-maintained, dark brick building, located on
 
a four-lane artery which traverses an established, upper-middle-class
 
neighborhood. The Jewish Community Center and Sherith Israel, the Orthodox
 
synagogue, are within walking distance. That section of West End Avenue Is also
 
the site of a number of substantial churches and a Bible college. Rabbi Glazer
 
and his family live in a house, recently built by the congregation, directly
 
behind the synagogue.
 
The synagogue itself has about 500 member families. It is governed by a
 
lay board and administered by the rabbi, a cantor, and the Education Director.
 
At the time of my research the cantor was preparing to leave for a position
 
elsewhere and the synagogue was going through the process of seeking a
 
replacement. Support staff includes secretaries, a kitchen supervisor, and
 
custodians. There are, of course, a number of teachers. The synagogue has
 
range of facilities, including two or three halls of worship, a large socia
 
hail, and offices for the three salaried professionals. In addition, there i
s a
 
school office, kitchen, library, and at least twelve classrooms. Parking areas
 
border the building on both ends and in the rear.
 
A f
ifteen-member, l
ay Education Committee oversees t
he school. Composed
 
largely o
f parents who have children enrolled in religious L
school, 
T
the
 
L
 
c o m mit tee m
 regularly. Members serve two-year t
erms. Miriam Halachmi i
s the
 
ee
t s
 
When Miriam began a
t West End the position was defined a
s half-time, but
 
that soon changed. She works Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays (
until the
 
Sabbath begins at sundown), and Sunday mornings, typically putting in more than
 
forty hours a week. In addition, she usually a
ttends Shabbat services because
 
the school expects her students t
o attend. She works eleven months a year.
 
According t
o her job description, Miriam's responsibilities include hiring
 
and training teachers; developing the curriculum; handling public relations;
 
programming holidays and the Shabbat; supervising the school building and i
ts
 
equipment; solving problems; ordering supplies and audio-visual equipment;
 
carrying out l
iaison with youth organizations; r
eporting to the r
eligious
 
school committee; teaching religious school; working with other professionals,
 
which includes weekly meetings with the Rabbi and cantor; setting s
chool
 
policy; handling school administration; participating in adult Jewish
 
education; maintaining school r
ecords; and enrolling and placing s
tudents. As
 
one o
f the synagogue's three salaried professional, Miriam directs virtually
 
every a
spect o
f the r
eligious school.
 
6
 
Rabbi Glazer is also involved in education a
t the synagogue,  although
 
not in the same ways as Miriam. As he says:
 
You may call me the executive educator. That's really how I
 
see the role of the rabbi. The rabbi's an educator, and I
 
function as such through my own teaching--that is, I have
 
adult education classes, as well as teaching classes in the
 
religious school. I teach a class, the bar and bat mitzvah
 
class.  .  .  .  In addition, I supervise, although not very
 
tightly, our educational director, on the assumption that
 
the goals are shared by both of us and it's her school. And
 
yet we meet together pretty much daily to talk about goals,
 
and programming, and ideas, and problems. So I keep my
 
finger on what's going on in the school, while not
 
interfering in the day-to-day operation. (ES82-BF-R13)
 
Teachers
 
About twenty adults teach at the West End Synagogue School in various
 
capacities. Miriam Halachmi, Rabbi Glazer, and the cantor each do some
 
teaching, as does Donna Glazer, the rabbi's wife. In addition, the synagogue
 
employs a staff of salaried, part-time teachers. According to Miriam, the
 
school formerly considered its own graduates to be qualified to instruct, but
 
in recent years there has been an attempt to hire teachers who have not only a
 
background in Judaism but also teaching certification. All but three
 
of the teachers âthe rabbi, cantor, and eleventh grade teacher âare women.
 
The r
eligious school catalog contains brief descriptions of the
 
qualifications of most, but not all, teachers. The range of academic
 
qualifications include: an M
.S. in Educational Psychology from Vanderbilt; a
 
B.A. in French Literature from Columbia and a B
.H.L. from the Jewish
 
7
 
Theological Seminary; and a degree in Jewish Philosophy from Haifa University
 
in Israel. The emphasis on credentials reflects a national concern in Jewish
 
education .
\
,,/
 
Most of the teachers do not hold other employment. Teachers are paid
 
according to experience and credentials. Not all teachers are Conservative
 
Jews. Sharon Beck, for example, is Orthodox and has had to reconcile her own
 
beliefs with the tenets of the Conservative Movement. Art and music teachers,
 
who supplement the primary teachers for the lower grades, need not be Jewish.
 
The school publishes a teachers' manual as well as an annual school catalog .
\,/'
 
I was impressed by the caliber of the teaching I observed. Every teacher
 
seemed knowledgeable. They were generally casual and friendly, most showing
 
good rapport with the students.
 
Classes and Curriculum
 
Religious school has two components. Hebrew school meets on Tuesday and
 
Thursday afternoons from 4
:10 P.M. until 5
:40 P.M. Sunday school convenes at 9
 
A.M. and runs until 12:00 noon. Students can begin religious school at three
 
years of age. For those who continue through the full program, a graduation
 
ceremony marks the conclusion of the eleventh grade. The school had
 
approximately 150 students during the 1981-1982 academic year, which ran from
 
September 1
3 though May 23. There i
s no summer school.
 
8
 
Age and secular school grade determine the grade level in religious
 
school. Preschool at the synagogue includes separate classes for
 
three-year-olds and four-year-olds. From kindergarten through eleventh grade
 
students are grouped into classes on the basis of their grade level in secular
 
school. Thus, a fifth grade student in secular school would be in the fifth
 
grade at religious school. Six and seventh grades are combined. As a result,
 
there are thirteen separate class levels, counting the preschool classes.
 
Preschool through first grade students attend school on Sundays onl .
 
Students in the eighth through tenth grades do the same. Second graders attend
 
on Sundays and Tuesday in preparation for the full Sunday, Tuesday, and
 
Thursday schedule for grades three through seven. Eleventh grade s
tudents
 
attend on alternate Sundays only.
 
Many schools associated with the Conservative Movement end after tenth
 
grade with a confirmation ceremony for the students. At West End an effort i
s
 
made to keep the students a year longer; hence the graduation ceremony at the
 
end of the eleventh grade.
 
Once they reach the second grade students begin to change classes and
 
teachers during each day's session. Sundays include three, fifty-five -minute
 
periods with breaks in between. Weekdays include two, forty-minute classes.
 
Each class period features a separate subject taught by a teacher who
 
specializes in the topic.
 
9
 
students a sense of their Jewishn
st
sibly, the United Synagogues of
 
America,
 
the Conservative Movement's national lay organization, s
ets certain
 
minimal standards for education in schools sponsored by Conservative
 
synagogues, and the individual schools then play a major role in the
 
determination of their curricula. West End, for example, offers six hours of
 
school each week, following the dictates of United Synagogues. The school has
 
set its own curricular priorities, however, and choses its own textbooks,
 
primarily through the efforts of Miriam Halachmi.
 
It is significant that, according to Rabbi Glazer, religious school at his
 
institution i
s more similar than dissimilar to religious schools a
t other
 
Conservative synagogues. Having served a number of other congregations, and
 
remaining in touch with his rabbinical colleagues through telephone
 
conversations, the rabbi feels that he is generally familiar with the various
 
shapes religious schools assume. Miriam is newer to Conservative education and,
 
therefore, less familiar with other schools. She attributes the basic
 
similarity between Conservative schools, which persists without substantial
 
central guidance,  to the fact that the vast majority of Conservative rabbis,
 
many school administrators, and even quite a few teachers receive their
 
education a
t the major Conservative seminary,  the Jewish Theological Seminary
 
in New York.
 
About establishing the curriculum for the middle grades, when s
tudents are
 
most involved in the school, Miriam says,
 
When you make a curriculum, first of all, you have to make
 
your priorities. We have major areas--prayer, Hebrew,
 
Jewish studies, ethics, and history.  So you have to make
 
1
0
 
your priorities because you have six hours a week and you
 
can't teach everything. The parents would have liked us to,
 
but we can't.
 
So I guess that we took as our priority for the middle
 
grades the prayers. So Hebrew is taught so that the kids
 
will be fluent when they get to the prayerbook--that they
 
won't have problems reading. If we have time, we teach them
 
some spoken Hebrew, but the stress is really Hebrew in
 
translation. Prayer eventually leads to the child being
 
able to conduct a Friday n
ight service. (ES82-BF-R5)
 
Prayer is,  then,  the foundation. Here I want t
o interje t
 
that members of the Jewish community in the United States di
 
ethnicity on the basis of a shared religious heritage and its concomitant
 
cultural history,  rather than in terms of national origins. It therefore stands
 
to reason that the core of an educational process which is designed to
 
inculcate a sense of cultural identity would focus on shared ritual and belief
 
systems.
 
The emphasis on prayer intensifies in the year preceeding the students'
 
bar or bat mitzvahs. Miriam feels that after the bar/bat mitzvah the students
 
should study more history. History, in Miriam's and the school's view,
 
encompasses Biblical history at one end and modern Jewish-American history and
 
Zionism at the other.
 
Miriam, then, has been faced with the task of e
stablishing a set o
f
 
curricular priorities. Rabbi Glazer, on the other hand, articulates a more
 
general set of goals for the curriculum.
 
We have to get kids to understand some notion of history,
 
where we've come from; some notion of who we are now, which
 
means Israel; some notion of our religious attitudes, which
 
means prayer services, and liturgy, and holidays, and
 
life-cycle events. We have t
o talk about Jewish values
 
because there is a Jewish way of looking at the world. And
 
we have to try to get our kids to understand the difference
 
1
1
 
and try to turn them towards looking at the world Jewishly.
 
That's perhaps the most difficult thing of all.
 
(
Es82-BF-R13)
 
How do these priorities and goals translate into specific course
 
offerings? For the preschool through first grade students the curriculum is
 
intended, according to the school catalog,  "
to provide an initial exposure to
 
Judaism which will be both fun and informative." By the end of first grade
 
students should have rudimentary Hebrew reading abilities. In those early years
 
students also have art and music classes.
 
From second through seventh grade the curriculum is compartmentalized.
 
Students have separate teachers for each of three classes âprayer, Hebrew, and
 
Jewish studies. The sixth and seventh graders also have a class in preparation
 
for bar/bat mitzvahs. In sum, the middle years are devoted to achieving a
 
degree of competence in religious ritual, including familiarity with the
 
liturgical language. These years also familiarize students with the cycle of
 
holidays, to instill a basic set of values, and to introduce Biblical history.
 
In eighth, ninth, and tenth grade the emphasis shifts to socio-cultural
 
studies. Required courses differ from grade to grade, with students in t
h
 
three grades also choosing electives. Eighth grade classes are "The Early
 
Prophets" and "The Jews of America." In the ninth grade the students take
 
"Milestones in the Life of a Jew" (which discusses traditional rites of passage
 
and contemporary issues such as dating non-Jews and premarital sex) and
 
"Highlights of Jewish History." Tenth grade students enroll in a class in
 
rabbinic civilization. They also take "
The Development of the Four Religious
 
Movements" for half the year and "
The Zionist Movement and the Palestinian
 
Issue" for the balance of the year. Electives in the 1
981-1982 school year
 
1
2
 
included a c
lass on how to deal with evangelical Christians and other
 
missionaries, a course in traditional ethics, a course on the role of women in
 
traditional and contemporary Judaism, and "High School Bowl," patterned on the
 
"College Bowl" television competitions. Eleventh grade students have no set
 
curriculum. Their teacher is listed as a "
facilitator," and they take a
 
topical, discussionâoriented approach, which they themselves determine.
 
There is no dearth of t
extbooks or other curricular materials for Jewish
 
schools. A number of publishers specialize in textbooks for them. Miriam buys
 
textbooks for West End most frequently from Behrtnan House in New York. She also
 
uses the catalogs o
 
d Torah Umesorah, both of which are also in New
 
York. The journal SAFRA provides her with reviews of new curricular materials,
 
and publishers'  catalogs suggest appropriate grade levels for specific titles.
 
The school also has a collection of filmstrips and other audioâvisual
 
materials.
 
I saw a variety of textbook formats. Some are straightforward histories.
 
Others, particularly those for prayer or Hebrew, are workbooks. The
 
"Milestones" class uses a set of short modules, each focusing on a relevant
 
topic. Many of the books have gone into a number o
f printings.  Some provide
 
:
eachers' editions. Cabinets in each classroom hold the textbooks when s
tudents
 
i
re not using them. Students do not usually take their books home, which i
s
 
indicative of the trend not to give homework, in recognition of the teachers'
 
realistic expectations. The school has been conservative about changing texts
 
because of the costs involved. The r
eligious school catalog contains a full
 
list of texts used in each course.
 
13
 
Students
 
Students attend religious school at West End Synagogue on a tuition basis.
 
The annual tuition of $60 covers approximately a quarter of the actual cost,
 
with the balance coming from the synagogue's general funds, derived for the
 
most part from membership dues assessed on a sliding scale pegged to income.
 
Only the children of synagogue members can attend. Scholarships, determined on
 
the basis of need, are available.
 
It is a truism that the smaller the Jewish community the higher the
 
percentage of children who are enrolled in religious school. West End's
 
enrollment reflects that trend. Rabbi Glazer says t
here are about 200
 
school-age children in the congregation;  at the start of the 1981-1982 school
 
year 150 were enrolled. Ninety-two percent of Nashville's Jews are affiliated
 
with one of the three synagogues, according to the rabbi.
 
Why are the students enrolled? This question i
s difficult t
o answer with
 
statistical precision. The answer seems to involve two s
i
 
facts. First, most of the students I spoke to began relig
 
their parents'  desire that they do so. The majority of the students start
 
religious school at the preschool level, at an age in which they could hardly
 
be expected to make the decision to enroll. So, generally speaking, the
 
decision to attend religious school is not the child's. Second, the school
 
teaches cultural identity and instructs students that a sense of ethnicity is
 
of great importance to American Jews. On the basis of my preliminary fieldwork
 
it is clear that parents wish their children to have a sense of Jewishness,
 
1
4
 
even above and beyond the matter of religiosity.  I will add the observation
 
that religious school is often a family tradition. Parents are quite likely to
 
have gone to Hebrew school; most of the current s
tudents will probably send
 
their own children, when the time comes.
 
Do the students enjoy religious school? Interestingly, most o
f the adults
 
I queried said "No" emphatically. One teacher-parent said,  '
They hate it.
 
That's how they feel, the same way I felt when I was going. They despise i
t."
 
Another teacher said,  "They're pretty negative about coming to Hebrew school."
 
Rabbi Glazer spoke facetiously about using "
guns and whips' to compel the
 
students to attend. Adults, then,  tend to feel it imperative that children
 
attend, but they view the children as unwilling participants.
 
Students, though, vary in their feelings about religious school. I
 
encountered a ranged of opinions. Some students validated the adults'
 
contentions, while others valued the experience for several reasons. The
 
younger students âpre-bar/bat mitzvah âoften seem to resent the time they must
 
put into religious school, yet many seem to enjoy the social aspects of the
 
experience. At religious school they see friends whom they would not see in
 
secular school. In fact, some very strong friendships are made in religious
 
school, something valued by many adults who feel that their children should
 
have at least some Jewish friends.
 
15
 
If some students dislike religious school, others respect i
t. Some of the
 
older students âand most students do continue beyond their bar/bat
 
mitzvahs--share their parents' assessment of the importance of participating in
 
the experience of being-a Jew. Religious school, then, becomes the vehicle by
 
which they explore and come to appreciate their  heritage.
 
West End Synagogue School in Context
 
Because Jewish communities are usually highly organized, I should make
 
brief mention of the fact that religious school is part of a complex
 
organizational network\ / he fact that there are a number of Jewish youth
 
organizations which involve the students is of particular significance.  West
 
End synagogue sponsors United Synagogue Youth (USY). There are other fraternal
 
and sororal organizations which draw students from all three religious schools.
 
The Jewish Community Center sponsors a range of youth activities and provides
 
recreational facilities. It also runs a summer day camp. Some Nashville parents
 
send their children to Jewish summer camps in other parts of the country;  a
 
number of the West End parents are sending their children to Camp Ramah in
 
Wisconsin, for example.
 
Few o
f the teachers participate in educators' organizations. Miriam,
 
Sharon Beck, and Rabbi Glazer attended a national conference last year
 
sponsored by an organization called the Coalition on Alternatives in Jewish
 
Education, however.
 
1
6
 
We cannot view the religious school at West End Synagogue in i
solation,
 
therefore. A more complete study would  icessarily examine the school in
 
relation to the broader organizational scheme of the Jewish community in
 
Nashville and throughout the nation.
 
Purposes of school
 
The s
ingle most important fact which emerges from my field research -is
 
that school at West End Synagogue exists to impart a strong sense of Jewish
 
identity to its students. Almost without regard to the content of any specific
 
course or even the curricular priorities, the school constitutes a structure
 
which formally transmits and reinforces that sense of identity, that
 
"Jewish-ness." Every person âadministrator, teacher, parent, or student âwith
 
whom I spoke agreed on the necessity of understanding one's Jewish-ness. On

and why they should be Jewish, and to try and keep them to be Jewish."
 
(ES82-BF-R7) It is the school's job, then, to teach the Jewish tradition, the
 
components of which underlie a person's understanding of who he or she is, at
 
least in terms of ethnicity. As we will see, this premium placed on identity
 
supercedes even the emphasis on matters purely religious.
 
A recurring theme was that Jews are a distinctive group and that, in a
 
largely non-Jewish world, it is necessary to band together, both to perpetuate
 
a culture which is of great value and to offer protection in a world which i
s
 
1
7
 
Center was bombed. In the words of one interviewee, Judaism is "a heavy
 
burden." Religious school attempts to provide the important historical and
 
theological basis for comprehending the "otherness" of Jews in America and
 
elsewhere. On that point Rabbi Glazer said,
 
If you answer the question,  "What is Judaism?" then you
 
know what you should be teaching. And, for me, Judaism is a
 
multi-faceted conglomeration âit's an organism. I call it a
 
civilization.  .
 .
 .  It goes beyond religion because you
 
can be a good Jew without being religious. I would rather
 
say that we Jews have a civilization all of our own. We
 
have our own liturgy, we have our own calendar, we have our
 
own state, we have our own literature, we have our own
 
laws, we have our own holy days, we have our own language.
 
We're really a civilization, and so, from my
 
standpoint, to be a Jew means to plug in to whatever part
 
of that civilization appeals to you and makes sense to you.
 
(ES82- F-R13)
 
English is the first language of virtually all the West End congregants.
 
Hebrew is not a conversational language for American Jews; yet, West End
 
Synagogue places considerable emphasis on Hebrew. If prayer is the foundation
 
of the curriculum, Hebrew is the means by which one traditionally prays. There
 
is only one course in conversational Hebrew. The assumption seems to be that
 
Hebrew, as a language of worship, is at the core of Jewishness. One should know
 
the prayers and have the ability to translate. The school teaches no Yiddish;
 
the younger generations seem to feel no need for i
t.
 
Too much assimilation, it is thought, destroys Jewishness. School,
 
therefore, is important for providing a balance to the tendency toward
 
assimilation. It does so in at least two ways. First and most obvious, it
 
transmits ideas and information about the distinctiveness of Judaism. Second
 
and perhaps equally important, it compels Jewish children to socialize with
 
18
 
other Jews. Suburbanization has diffused the community in Nashville. Religious
 
school at West End exposes students to significant Jewish role models, and it
 
makes available a pool of Jewish peers and potential friends.
 
The school sometimes faces the issue of assimilation head-on. For example,
 
this year it sponsored a high school retreat in the synagogue. The focus of the
 
program was a presentation by a Jew who had joined and later renounced a cult.
 
Essentially, she told the students how to deflect cultists' recruiting tactics.
 
Another example is the elective course "How to Answer," which is concerned with
 
how to cope with evangelical Christians.
 
There is a great emphasis on rationality and a premium on learning for its
 
own sake in Conservative Judaism. A number of informants told me that, even if
 
a person rejects his or her Jewish-ness, religious school is crucial because it
 
allows one to make the decision based on knowledge rather than ignorance.
 
Both Miriam Halachmi and Rabbi Glazer feel that to accomplish the school's
 
goals it is necessary that the students' homelife reflect and reinforce what
 
the school does.  If school is intended to teach Jewishness, it i
s imperative
 
that family life be Jewish as well. At the visitation day for parents of
 
preschool students both the Rabbi and Miriam
 
assembled parents, saying that a partnership
 
effective. Rabbi Glazer, though, thinks that
 
not realized. At one point he said to me,
 
spoke about that subject to the
 
is required for the school to be
 
in many cases the partnership i
s
 
We operate in a vacuum, in a sense, because they go home
 
after they leave here. We only see them six hours a week.
 
And the homes that they go back to are, for the most part,
 
Jewishly dry, and unobservant, and nonpious. That's not to
 
say they're not caring--they are caring--but in terms of
 
ritual observance, synagogue attendance, personal study
 
19
 
habits there's u
sually very l
ittle. And s
o we have an
 
additional burden that we have to-come up against, and that
 
i
s what happens to the kids when- they go home. We talk
 
about a partnership all the t
ime with the parents, but I
 
know very well that the kid's Jewish education he's going
 
t
o get here. (
ES82-BF-R13)
 
In the same vein, Miriam adds,  "
We say we can give information. We cannot
 
teach commitment .
 
â
 â
 â . So if the families are not doing something t
o keep the
 
kids Jewish, I don't think we can do the job ourself." (
ES82-BF-R5)
 
The dissonance between the school administrators' emphasis on the
 
importance o
f homelife and their disappointed perception of the r
eality i
s even
 
more striking when viewed against the fact that the majority o
f parents do send
 
their children to religious school. One explanation for the disparity in
 
attitudes i
s that parents tend to feel it is the school's responsibility t
o do
 
what the school believes i
s a shared responsibility. I prefer t
o view it
 
differently. To me this situation clearly illustrates the contention that
 
Jewish-ness and Jewish r
eligious devotion are not one and the same. Families
 
may not practice religious ritual a
t home. They may not attend services at the
 
synagogue. But they continue t
o send their children t
o school a
t the synagogue,
 
in my estimation, because they value their Jewish-ness above and beyond the
 
devotional a
spects of their culture. I

Fieldwork Techniques
 
My fieldwork commenced just as Passover was beginning. An e
ight-day
 
holiday during which religious school is cancelled, Passover is observed with
 
ritual meals called seders. My first physical contact with the West End
 
congregation was a seder at Rabbi Melvin Glazer's house. After some preliminary
 
telephone conversations with a member of the synagogue I had decided to phone
 
Rabbi Glazer in an attempt to gain official entry to the synagogue. Rabbi
 
Glazer reminded me that Passover was to begin that evening and invited my
 
wife and me to his family's seder the following evening. The seder was a t
ime
 
to meet the young rabbi and his family and to talk briefly about the project.
 
On Rabbi Glazer's advice I then telephoned Miriam Halachmi, the
 
synagogue's Education Director. She asked that I send her something in writing
 
about the project which she could present to the lay committee which governs
 
the
 
school. It was not
 
necessary, she felt, for me to meet with the committee.
 
She requested that I call back a week later, when she would have had a chance
 
to talk with the committee and when school was back in session. Not wanting me
 
to visit the school before she had had the chance to brief her teachers, she
 
asked that I wait until the week following the first session after Passover.
 
In the meantime, realizing that Passover is not a holiday in which all
 
secular activities are affected, I began to set up interviews with parents o
f
 
students. Because of the delay caused by the holiday I had visited and
 
interviewed two mothers of students before I set foot in the school. The first
 
mother, Sandy Averbuch, has a daughter preparing for her bat mitzvah at West
 
End's religious school. In addition, all of her children attend Akiva, the
 
21

The following week I made my first visit to the synagogue, where I
 
interviewed Miriam Halachini and began sitting in on classes. I made a total of
 
six site visits. School was in session on five of those visits; consequently I
 
had the opportunity to observe a range of classes and teachers, along with
 
other aspects of the school. I interviewed teacher Sharon Beck prior to her
 
class, which I tape-recorded. I attended a Sunday visitation day for parents of
 
preschoolers with Bob Gates, a photographer and folklore graduate student. My
 
wife Maxene, a public school teacher, and I devoted a Sunday to observing the
 
udents in class and interviewing a tenth-grade student who many feel is
 
o
f what the school ought to accomplish. I had the opportunity to speak
 
with many other students and teachers. I also made an informal
 
on of the synagogue library and used i
t for some historical research.
 
After  school one Sunday I visited and interviewed Robert Workman, father o
f two
 
students. My final visit to the synagogue was on a Wednesday, when school was
 
not in session. That day I interviewed Rabbi Glazer and spent a final session
 
with Miriam Halachmj.
 
On a personal note I might add that this was particularly interesting
 
fieldwork because Jewish communities tend to differ in several significant ways
 
from the other communities in which I have worked. I have done field research
 
22
 
in various ethnic communities and in a number of regional cultures. American
 
Jews are statistically among the best educated and most affluent groups in the
 
United States. My informants were all well educated and conversant to more than
 
an average extent with the academic world. Some were familiar with the
 
discipline of folklore âone has a brother who is a folklorist, another studied
 
with a prominent folklorist, and yet another has some familiarity with studies
 
in Jewish folklore. The notion of "
the field" as an "
other" place âa holdover
 
from our disciplinary past âsimply is not relevant here. Not only could I
 
gather information from my resource people, but I could also discuss
 
interpretations and their consequences with community members in ways I have
 
not been able to do on previous projects. In fact, American Jews have a well
 
established tradition of studying themselves. Some informants had relevant
 
statistics and demographic data at their fingertips. Needless to say, in my
 
role as fieldworker, I was also asked some challenging questions.
 
Conclusions
 
It has barely been possible to scratch the surface during this project.
 
Ideally, research would follow the school through a full academic year. Regular
 
visits spread out over a year would make it possible to see students learn and
 
to get a much better understanding of the process. A year's research would
 
include participation in special events, such as holiday programs, bar/bat
 
mitzvah, and USY-sponsored programs. In addition, for the findings to be
 
anything more than preliminary and speculative, it would be necessary to
 
interview a wider sample of the students, teachers, and parents, as well as to
 
do follow-up interviews with key participants.
 
23
 
I have pointed out, too, that religious school at West End i
s part of a
 
Jewish network. For a more complete understanding of the school, it would help
 
to have the opportunity to study the network itself. Finally, Nashville is an
 
ideal city for a broader study of the way in which Jewish community schools
 
function. The three most common forms of American Judaism are represented, each
 
by one school. In that respect the city contains a microcosm of American
 
Judaism. Preliminary research is complete in one of the three schools. It would
 
be worthwhile to broaden and complete the study by moving from the focus on one
 
school to a consideration of a community as a whole and its schools.
 
According to the literature, the structure, administration, and curriculum
 
of Jewish education at West End Synagogue is typical of schools a
ssociated with
 
Conservative synagogues
s to the school's spirit and other, less tangible
 
aspects, it is difficult to speak of typicality. I came away from my all too
 
brief encounter with the school feeling that I had seen high spirits and strong
 
dedication, with an emphasis on professionalism. All of these characteristics
 
manifested themselves in an ambience which is humane and in a school which is,
 
in large measure, quite a success. Robert Workman, a parent whom I interviewed,
 
grew up in larger Jewish communities in the North. He told me that in medical
 
school his Jewish roommate "came from, I think, Omaha, Nebraska, or something.
 
Probably a Jewish community the same size as Nashville. And I thought he had a
 
fantastic Jewish education. And I couldn't understand how a small city could
 
have educated him so well. But I understand it now." I concur.

I chose to focus on Jewish education at West End Synagogue for several
 
reasons. The Conservative movement in Judaism i
s generally thought of as
 
occupying the middle ground between the strict devotion of Orthodoxy and the
 
more assimilationist stance of the Reform Movement. The Conservative Movement
 
is seen as maintaining the traditions of Judaism, yetâ adjusting t
o the demands
 
made by life in contemporary American cu4-tia
-reT A textbook written for secondary
 
students in Conservative schools describes the movement as follows:
 
Conservative Judaism stresses the element of historical
 
continuity. Conservatism stresses that t
raditions have
 
helped hold the Jews together. It believes that strict
 
following of old customs is not good, but it believes in a
 
living tradition which changes according to the needs of
 
the  time. Therefore Conservative Judaism has concentrated
 
on keeping alive much of the Jewish religious tradition,
 
including its customs, ceremonies and folklore
 .&/
 
One reason for my choice, then, was an intellectual one âthe question of
 
the relationship between ethnic education and a sense of tradition which i
s
 
promulgated
 
accepts the
 
deâemphasis
 
on a notion of process rather than stasis,"_a viewpoint which
 
fact of acculturation but not at the price of assimilation or t
he
 
of tradition. A second reason was both personal and pragmatic.
 
Until the age of thirteen I spent six hours a week in a Conservative school in
 
the suburbs of Philadelphia. Although no longer involved in any institutional
 
hi tL& /
 
aspect of Judaism, I fe f t
-
h
-at what r
emained of my insider's cultural knowledge
 
1
 
could be of use, particularly in consideration of the brief time available for
 
the field research4
/A third reason was purely pragmatic. After telephone
 
conversations with people active in Nashville's Jewish community it seemed
 
likely that West End Synagogue--its school administration, rabbi, and
 
congregants âwould be amenable t
o being involved in the research.

When Miriam began at West End the position was defined as half-time, but
 
that soon changed. She works Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays (
until the
 
Sabbath begins at sundown), and Sunday mornings, typically putting in more than
 
forty hours a week.  In addition, she usually attends Shabbat services because
 
the school expects her students to attend. She works eleven months a year.
 
According to her job description, Miri m's_responsibilities include h

Thursday afternoons from 4

years of age. For those who continue through the full program, a graduation
 
ceremony marks the conclusion of the eleventh grade. The school had

September 1

Age and secular school grade deteriÃ±Tine the grade level in r

school. Preschool at the synagogue includes separate classes for
 
three-year-olds and four-year-olds. From kindergarten through eleventh grade
 
students are grouped into classes on the basis of their grade level in secular
 
school. Thus .
9"*a fifth grade student in secular school would be in the fifth
 
grade at religious school. Six and seventh grades are combined. As a result,
 
there are thirteen separate class levels, counting the preschool c
lasses.
 
Preschool through first grade students attend school on Sundays only.
 
Students in the eighth through t
enth grades do the same. Second graders attend
 
on Sundays and Tuesday in preparation for the full Sunday, Tuesday, and
 
Thursday schedule for grades three through seven. Eleventh grade s

attend on alternate Sundays only.

%he United Synagogues
 
America, the Conservative Movement's national l
ay organization, sets certain
 
minimal standards for education in schools sponsored by Conservative
 
synagogues, and the individual schools then play a major role in the
 
'
1
 
determination of their curricula. West End, for example, offers six hours of
 
school each week, following the dictates of United Synagogues. The school has
 
set its own curricular priorities, however, and choses its own textbooIs,
 
primarily through the efforts of Miriam Halachmi.
 
I
t i
s significant that, according to Rabbi Glazer,  religious school a
t his
 
institution is more similar than dissimilar to r
eligious schools a
t other
 
Conservative synagogues. Having served a number of other congregations, and
 
[

shapes religious schools assume. H

-r
n is newer to Conservative education and,
 
therefore, less familiar with other schools. She attributes the basic
 
similarity between Conservative schools, which persists without substantial
 
central guidance,  to the fact that the vast majority of Conservative rabbis,
 
many school administrators, and even quite a few t
eachers receive their
 
education at the major Conservative seminary,  the Jewish Theological Seminary
 
in New York.
 
About establishing -the curriculum for the middle grades, when s
tudents are
 
/Am
 
most involved in the school, M44:iam says,
 
When you make a curriculum, first of all, you have to make
 
your priorities. We have major areas--prayer, Hebrew,
 
Jewish studies, ethics, and history.  So you have to make
 
1
0
 
Your priorities because y0Ã¼ hav
 
can't teach everything. The parents would have liked u
s t
o,
 
but we can't.
 
So I guess that we took as our priority for the middle
 
grades the prayers. So Hebrew is taught so that the kids
 
will be fluent when they get to the prayerbook âthat they
 
won't have problems reading. If we have t
ime, we teach them
 
some spoken Hebrew, but the stress is really Hebrew in
 
translation. Prayer eventually leads to the child being
 
able to conduct a Friday night service. (ES82-BF-R5)
 
Prayer is,  then,  the foundation. Here I want to interject the obs ervation
 
that members of the Jewish community in the United States distinguish their
 
ethnicity on the basis of a shared religious heritage and itS
omit
'
 
- 
Cultural history,  rather than in terms  of nat
ional
 origins.
 I
t  t
herefore
 stands
 
to reason that the core of an educational process which is designed t
o
 
inculcate a sense of cultural identity would focus on shared r
itual and b
elief
 
systems.

-; then, has been faced with the task o
f e
stablishing a set of
 
curricular priorities. Rabbi Glazer, on the other hand, articulates a more
 
general set of goals for the curriculum.
 
We have to get kids t
o understand some notion of history'
 
where we've come from; some notion of who we are now, which
 
means Israel; some notion of our religious attitudes, which
 
means prayer services, and l
iturgy, and holidays, and
 
life-cycle events. We have t
o talk about Jewish values
 
because there is a Jewish way of looking at the world. And
 
we have to try to get our kids to understand the difference
 
1
1
 
and try to turn them toward  looking at the world Jewishly.
 
That's perhaps the most difficult thing of all.
 
(
Es82-BF-R13)
 
How do these pri rities and goals translate into specific course
 
offerings? For the preschool through first grade students the curriculum is
 
intended, according to the school catalog,  "
to provide an initial exposure t
o
 
Judaism which will be both fun and informative." By the end of first grade
 
students should have rudimentary Hebrew reading abilities. In t
hose early years
 
students also have art and music classes.
 
From second through seventh grade the curriculum i
s compartmentalized.
 
Students have separate teachers for each of three classes âprayer, Hebrew, and
 
Jewish studies. The sixth and seventh graders also have a class in preparation

In eighth, ninth, and tenth grade the emphasis shifts to socio-cultural
 
studies. Required
 
courses differ from grade to grade, with
 
students
 
in the
 
three grades also choosing electives. Eighth grade classes are "The Early
 
Prophets" and "The Jews of America.'  In the ninth grade the students t
ake
 
;
"Milestones in the Life of a Jew" (which discusses traditional rites of passage
 
and contemporary issues
 tlsuch as dating no n-J ews  an d premar
ita l sex
) and  
"Highlights of Jewish History." Tenth grade students enroll in a class in
 
rabbinic c
ivilization. They also take "
The Development of the Four Religious
 
Movements" for half the year and "The Zionist Movement and the Palestinian
 
Issue" for the balance of the year. Electives in the 1
981-1982 school year
 
1
2
 
included a c
lass on how to deal with evangelical Christians and other
 
missionaries, a course in traditional ethics, a course on the role of women in
 
traditional and contemporary Judaism, and "High School Bowl," patterned on the
 
"
College Bowl" television competitions. Eleventh grade students have no set
 
curriculum. Their teacher is listed as a "
facilitator," and they take a
 
topical, discussion-oriented aProac y whr
'ch they themselves determine.
 
There is no dearth of t
extbooks or other curricular materials for :
Jewish
 
schools. A number of publishers specialize in textbooks for them. Miriam buys
 
textbooks for West End most frequently from Behrman House in New York. She also
 
uses the catalogs
 
d Torah Umesorah, both of which are also in New
 
York. The journal SAFRA provides her with reviews of new curricular materials,
 
and publishers'  catalogs suggest appropriate grade levels for specific titles.
 
The school also has a collection of f
ilmstrips and other audio-visual
 
materials.
 
I saw a variety of textbook formats. Some are straightforward histories.
 
Others, particularly those for prayer or Hebrew, are workbooks. The
 
"Milestones" class uses a set of short modules, each focusing on a relevant
 
topic. Many of the books have gone into a number of printings. Some provide
 
teachers' editions. Cabinets in each classroom hold t
he textbooks when s
tudents
 
are not using them. Students do not usually take their books home, which i
s
 
indicative of the trend not to give homework, in recognition of the t
eachers'
 
realistic expectations. The school has been conservative about changing texts
 
because of the costs involved. The r
eligious school catalog contains a full
 
list of texts used in each course.
 
13
 
Students
 
Students attend religious school at West End Synagogue on a tuition b
asis.
 
The annual tuition of $60 covers approximately a quarter of the actual cost,
 
with the balance coming from the synagogue's general funds, derived for the
 
most part from membership dues assessed on a sliding scale pegged to income.
 
Only
 ildren of synagogue members can attend. Scholarships, d
eter ined on
 
the basis of need, are available.
 
It is a truism that the smaller the Jewish community the higher the
 
percentage of children who are enrolled in religious school. West End's
 
enrollment reflects that trend. Rabbi Glazer says there are about 200
 
e children in the congregation;  at the start of the 1981-1982 school
 
were enrolled. Ninetyâtwo percent of Nashville's Jews are affiliated
 
th one of the three synagogues, according t
o the rabbi.
 
Why are the students enrolled? This question i
s difficult t
o answer with
 
statistical precision. The answer seems to involve two simple but related
 
facts. First, most of the students I spoke to began r
eligious school because o
f
 
their parents' desire that they do so. The majority of the students start
 
religious school at the preschool level, at an.-age--4
whjch they could hardly
 
be expected to make the decision to enroll. So,/generally speaking,  the
 
decision to attend reli ious school is not the child's. Second,  t
he school
 
teaches cultural identity and instructs students that a sense of ethnicity i
s
 
of great importance to American Jews. On the basis of my preliminary fieldwork, .
 
it is clear that parents wish their children to have a sense of Jewish

even above and beyond the matter o
f religiosity.  i will add the observation
 
that religious school is often a family tradition. Parents are quite likely to
 
have gone to Hebrew school; most of the current students will probably send
 
their own children, when the time comes.
 
Do the students enjoy religious school? Interestingly, most o
f the adults
 
I queried said "No" emphatically. One teacher-parent said,  "They hate it.
 
That's how they feel, the same way I felt when I was going. They despi e i
t."
 
Another teacher said,  "They're pretty negative about coming to Hebrew school."
 
Rabbi Glazer spoke facetiously about using "
guns and whips" to compel the
 
students to attend. Adults, then,  tend to feel it imperative that children
 
attend, but they view the children as unwilling participants.
 
Students. ât
n
i'vary in their feelings about religious school.  1
 
encountered a range/ of opinions. Some students validated the adults'

while others valued the experience for s-v

ime they must
 
put into religious school, yet many seem to enjoy the social aspects of the
 
experience. At religious school they see friends whom they would not see in
 
secular school. In fact, some very strong friendships are made in religious
 
school, something valued by many adults who fccl that their children should
 
have at least some Jewish friends.
 
which they explore and come to appreciate their  heritage.

West End Synagogue School
 
Because  Jewish communities  are usually highly  organized,
 
we  cannot view  the  religious  school  at West End Synagogue  in

 Religious
 
school  at West End  is  part  of  a complex  organizational  and
 
institutional  network.

particular  significance.

The single most important f t which emerges from my field r
esearch is
 
that school at West End Synagogue exists to impart a strong sense of Jewis:
 
identity to its students. Almost without regard to the content of any specific
 
course pr even the curricular priorities, the school constitutes a structure
 
,
 
L Jh Lo
.
.
rmal1y 
r
T
r1- reÂ±f
lf
 that sense of identity, that
 
"Jewjs
s5.' Every person â
a
jnistrator  teacher, parent, or student âwith
 
whom I spoke agreed on the necessity of understanding one's J
&
 ess  On
 
that point a number of significant themes became apparent.
 
-
 
Sharon Beck said that school ought  "
to teach Jews what it i
s t
o be Jewish
 
and why they should be Jewish, and to try and keep them to be Jewish.
 
(ES82-BF-R7) It is the school's job, then, to teach t
he Jewish t
radition, the
 
components of which underlie a person's understanding of who he or she is, at
 
least in t
erms of ethnicity. As we will see, .ht  premium placed on identity
 
supercedes even the emphasis on matters purely religious.
 
?
 
A recurring theme was that Jews are a distinctive group and that, in a
 
largely non-Jewish world, it is necessary to band together, both to perpetuate
 
a culture which is of great value and to offer protection in a world which i
s

at times hostile. During the civil ri iits era Nashville's Jewish Community
 
Center was bombed. In the words of one interviewee, Judaism i
s "
a heavy
 
burden.
"  Religious school attempts t
o provide the important historical and
 
theological basis for comprehending the "otherness" of Jews in America and
 
elsewhere. On that point Rabbi Glazer said,
 
(
2
 
If you answer the question,  "What is Judaism?" then you
 
know what you should be teaching. And, for me, Judaism i
s a
 
multiâfaceted conglomeration âit's an organism. I call it a
 
civilization.  .
 .
 .  It goes beyond religion because you
 
can be a good Jew without being religious. I would rather
 
say that we Jews have a civilization all of our own. We
 
have our own liturgy, we have our own calendar, we have our
 
own state, we have our o
wn literature, we have our o
wn
 
laws, we have our o
wn holy days, we have our o
wn language.
 
â¢
 â¢
 .  We're really a ci vili za ti on,  an d so,  from  my  
standpoint, to be a Jew means to plug in to whatever part
 
of that civilization appeals to you and makes sense to you.

English is the  irst language of virtually all the West End congregants.
 
Hebrew i
s not a conversational language for American Jews; yet/"West End
 
Synagogue places considerable emphasis on Hebrew. If prayer is the foundation
 
of the curriculum, Hebrew i
s
 
kc /
 
the means by which one traditionally prays. f+r T
 
only one course in conversational Hebrew. The assumption seems t
o b
e that
 
Hebrew, as a language of worship, is a
t the core of Jewishness. One should know
 
the prayers and have the ability to translate. The school teaches no Yiddish;
 
the younger generations seem to feel no need for it.
 
Too much assimilation, it i
s thought, destroys Jewishness. School,
 
therefore, is important for providing a balance to the tendency toward
 
assimilation. It does so in at least two ways. First and most obvious, it
 
transmits ideas and information about the distinctiveness of Judaism. Second
 
and perhaps equally important, i
t compels Jewish children to socialize with
 
18
 
other Jews. Suburbanization has diffused--t
-he community in Nashville. Religious
 
school a
t West End exposes students to significant Jewish role models, and it
 
makes available a pool of Jewish peers and potential friends.
 
The school sometimes faces the issue of assimilation head-on. For examp
 
this year it sponsored a high school retreat in the synagogue. The focus of
 
program was a presentation by a Jew who had joined and later renounced a cult.
 
Essentially, she told the students how to deflect cultists' recruiting tactics.
 
Another example is the elective course "How to Answer," which is concerned with
 
how to cope with evangelical Christians.

There is a great emphasis on rationality and a premium on learning for its
 
own sake in Conservative Judaism. A number of informants told me that, even if

ecause it
 
A 
allows one to make the decision based on knowledge rather than ignorance.
 
g
, 
Both Miriam Halachmi and Rabbi Glazer feel that to accomplish the school's
 
goals i
t i
s necessary that the students' homelife reflect and reinforce what
 
the school does. If school is intended to teach Jewishness, it i
s imperative
 
t
Jiat family life be Jewish as well. At the visitation day for parents of
 
/
 
/  preschool students both the Rabbi and -
Mi
-r4etir spoke about that subject t
o the
 
assembled parents, saying that a partnership is required for the school t
o b
e
 
effective. Rabbi Glazer
ink5 that in many cases the partnership i
s
 
not realized. At one point he said to me,
 
We operate in a vacuum, in a sense, because they go home
 
after they leave here. We only see them six hours a week.
 
And the homes that they go back to are, for the most part,
 
Jewishly dry, and unobservant, and nonpious. That's not to
 
say they're not caring âthey are caring--but in terms of
 
ritual observance, synagogue attendance, personal study
 
19
 
habits there's usually very -little. And so we have an
 
additional burden that we have to come up against, and that
 
is what happens to the kids when they go home. We talk
 
about a partnership all the time with the parents, but I
 
know very well that the kid's Jewish - education he's going
 
to get here.  (ES82-BF-R13)
 
(
AZA "
 
In the same vein, Miriam adds,  We say we can give information. We cannot
 
teach commitment.  â¢  .  .  So if the families are not doing something to keep the
 
kids Jewish, I don't think we can do the job ourself." (ES82-BF-R5)
 
The dissonance between the school administrators' emphasis on the
 
importance of homcjlife and their disappointed perception of the r
eality i
s even
 
more striking when viewed against the fact that the majority of parents do send
 
their children to religious school. One explanation for the disparity in
 
attitudes is that parents tend to
ee

-

what the s
-
eoi -
-believes is a shared responsibility. I prefer to view it
 
-

differently. To me this situation clearly illustrates the contention that
 
j /
 
JQw13h  t&s and Jewish religious devotion are not one and the same. Families
 
may not practice religious ritual a
t home. They may not attend services at the
 
synagogue. But they continue to send their children t
o school at the synagogue,
 
in my estimation, because they value their J I sh- e
 above and beyond the
 
devotional aspects of their culture. It can be of great importance t
o identify
 
one 
s 
1
 clf as a Jew an d to move
 com
fortably
 in  the  culture,
 even
 i
f  you  do  not  
practice the religious r
itual. School is important, therefore, because it
 
teaches JewisFj ness, which is not synonymous with religiosity.

Fieldwork Ter-1 ' r
u
âesï¿½_
 
My fieldwork commenced just as Passover was beginning. An eight-day
 
holiday during which religious school is cancelled, Passover i
s observed with
 
ritual meals called seders. My first physical contact with the West End
 
congregation was a seder at Rabbi Melvin Glazer's house. After some preliminary
 
telephone conversations with a member of the synagogue I had decided to phone
 
Rabbi Glazer in an attempt to gain official entry to the synagogue. Rabbi
 
Glazer reminded me that Passover was to begin that evening and invited my
 
wife and me to his family's seder the following evening. The seder was a t
ime
 
to meet the young rabbi and his family and to talk briefly about the project.
 
On Rabbi Glazer's advice I then telephoned Miriam Halachmi 1 the 
She asked that I send her something in writing
 
about the project which she could present to the lay committee which governs
 
the school. It was not necessary, she -
fe-It  for me to meet with the committee.
 
,She requested that I call back a week later, when she would have had a chance
 
to talk with the committee and when school was back in session. Not wanting me
 
to visit the school before she had had the chance to brief her teachers, she
 
asked that I wait until the week following the first session after Passover.
 
In the meantime, realizing that Passover i
s not a holiday in which all
 
secular activities are affected, I began to set up interviews with parents o
f
 
students. Because of the delay caused by the holiday I had visited and
 
interviewed two mothers of students before I set foot in the school. The first
 
mother, Sandy Averbuch, has a daughter preparing for her bat mitzvah at West
 
End's religious school. In addition, all of her children attend Akiva, the

 She is very
 
active in the Jewish community and is a self-described  career volunteer." My
 
second interviewee, Hedy Pollack, has a daughter in the third grade at West End
 
Synagogue.
._M
.e y also teaches on Sundays for the school.  She is a former chair
 
of the synagogue's Education Committee.
 
The following week I made my first visit to the synagogue, where r
 
interviewed Miriam Halachmi and began sitting in on classes. I made a total of
 
six site visits. School was in session on five of those visit :--consequently I
 
had the opportunity to observe a range of classes and teac he.r
-s>/a1ong with
 
other aspects of the school. I interviewed teacher Sharon Beck prior to her
 
class, which I tape-recorded. I attended a Sunday visitation day for parents of
 
preschoolers with Bob Gates, a photographer and folklore graduate student. My
 
wife Maxene, a public school teacher, and I devoted a Sunday to observing the
 
older students in class and interviewing a tenth-grade student who many feel i
s
 
a model of what the school ought to accomplish. I had the opportunity to speak
 
casually with many other students and teachers. I also made an informal
 
evaluation of the synagogue library and used it for some historical research.
 
After school one Sunday I visited and interviewed Robert Workman, father of two
 
students. My final visit to the synagogue was on a Wednesday, when school was
 
not in session. That day I interviewed Rabbi Glazer and spent a f
inal s
ession
 
with Miriam Halachmj.
 
On a personal note I might add that this was particularly interesting
 
fieldwork because Jewish communities tend to differ in several significant ways
 
from the other communities in which I have worked.  I have done field research
 
22
 
in various ethnic communities and in
 number of regional cultures. American
 
Jews are statistically among the best educated and most affluent groups in the
 
United States. My informants were all well educated and conversant to more than
 
an average extent with the academic world. Some were familiar with the
 
discipline of folklore âone has a brother who is a folklorist, another studied
 
with a prominent folklorist, and yet another has some familiarity with studies
 
in Jewish folklore. The notion of "
the field" as an "
other" place âa holdover
 
from our disciplinary past âsimply is not relevant here. Not only could I
 
gather information from my resource people, but I could also discuss
 
interpretations and their consequences with community members in ways I have
 
not been able to do on previous projects. In fact, American Jews have a well
 
established tradition of studying themselves. Some informants had relevant
 
statistics and demographic data at their fingertips. Needless to say, in my
 
role as fieldworker, I was also asked some challenging questions.
 
It has barely been possible to scratch the surface during this project.
 
Ideally, research would follow the school through a full academic year. Regular
 
visits spread out over a year would make it possible to see students learn and
 
(a
 
to get a much better underst an di ng of the process. A year's research would
 
I
t
 
include participation in special events, such as holiday programs, bar (
bat
 
mitzvahs, and USY-sponsoied programs. In addition, for the findings to be
 
anything more than preliminary and speculative, i
t would be necessary to
 
interview a wider sample of the students,  teachers, and parents, a
s well as_toY'
 
do, follow-up interviews with key participants.
 
23
 
I have pointed out, too, that r
eligious school at West End i
s part of a
 
Jewish network. For a more complete understanding of the school, i
t would help
 
to have the opportunity to study the network itself. Finally, Nashville i
s an
 
ideal city for a broader study of the way in which Jewish community schools
 
function. The three most common forms of American Judaism are r
epresented, each
 
by one school. In that respect the city contains a microcosm of American
 
Judaism. Preliminary research is complete in one of the three schools. .
It would
 
be worthwhile to broaden and complete the study by moving from the f
' 'i'
 
school to a consideration of
 community as a whole

grew up in larger Jewish communities in the North. He told me that in medical
 
school his Jewish roommate "came from, I think, Omaha, Nebraska, or something.
 
Probably a Jewish community the same size as Nashville. And I t
hought he had a
 
fantastic Jewish education. And I couldn't understand how a small city could
 
have educated him so well. But I understand it now." I concur.
