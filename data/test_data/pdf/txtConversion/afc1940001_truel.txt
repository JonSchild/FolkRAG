True Lover of [Mine?]Where are you going? To Caprian.Green grows the merry and tine,And if
you see that nice young man,I want him for a true lover of mine.Tell him to plow me one acre of
ground,Green grows the merry and tine,And plant it all over with one grain of corn,And he shall be
a true lover of mine.Tell him to thresh it 'gainst yonders barn,Green grows the merry and tine,That
never was built since Adam was born,And he shall be a true lover of mine.Tell him to thresh it against
yonders wall,Green grows the merry and tine,And not for the life of him let one grain fall,And he shall
be a true lover of mine. *Tell her to make me one cambric shirt,Green grows the merry and tine,And
not for the life of her let one stitch of it be needlework,And she shall be a true lover of mine.Tell her
to iron it with a red hot iron,Green grows the merry and tine,And not for the life of her let one stitch
of it burn,And she shall be a true lover of mine.
* This stanza was dictated to the transcriber by Mr. Graham.

That is all I can recall now. I shall have to go get a drink of water.
* I took the expression "merry and tine" from the card, for I couldn'tunderstand what he said.
