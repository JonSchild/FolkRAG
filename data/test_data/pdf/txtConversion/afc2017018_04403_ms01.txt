I: 
Okay. These are on. I’m gonna check these once in a while just to make sure they’re still going. 
I2: 
Okay. I’m good. 
I: 
All right. We on? 
I2: 
Yes.  
I: 
All right. I’m gonna start by saying thank you, K, for agreeing to this interview. 
P: 
You’re very welcome. 
I: 
And thank you so much for the work that you do. We’re doing these interviews because we think what 
you’re doing is extremely valuable, and we want people to know more about what you do, so thank you for 
being here. As I mentioned, we’re going to divide this into three sections, and the first section is just to learn a 
little bit more about you and the job, and we’ll start—we want to hear your stories. And we’re going to start with 
your story, so tell us about how you got into this line of work, how long you’ve been doing it and why you keep 
doing it? 
P: 
Sheer luck. I was not a good factory rat. I wanted more, had a friend who was an LPN [1.16.28] at a 
healthcare facility in Indiana. And she just said, “CNA classes are goin’ on. Go.” And I signed up for a class to 
be taught by a Catholic nun [laughs]. Why? And that’s where it began. 
I: 
And how long ago was that? 
P: 
Oh, goodness. That was in ’93. 
I: 
’93. 
P: 
Yes, 1993. 
I: 
So, you’ve been doing this for a while. 
P: 
Oh, yes. Yeah. 
I: 
So, what kind of factor rat were you? 
P: 
Oh, I did—Robin Air was in Indiana, and that was like air-conditioning units. I was quality. I checked the 
air pressure. I just—I can’t do the mundane things over and over and over. It’s just not me. Went to  a paper 
mill, tried to run, you know, do that. It’s still the same thing over and over and over, same, same, same. 
I: 
Boring. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
For you. 
P: 
Yeah. And I think I just felt like I needed—I fit helping people. 
I: 
So, you signed up for a CNA class. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Taught by a nun. 
P: 
Yep. 
I: 
Tell me about the nun.

P: 
[Laughing] I do not even remember her name. It was wonderful. She [1.15.05] was very hands-on. 
Evacuating a patient for a fire—do the sheet roll, get ‘em outta bed, put on a sheet, go down the stairs. You 
had to be that patient being pulled down the stairs, so you knew what not to do. 
I: 
Applied teaching. 
P: 
Yes. It worked very well. 
I: 
Okay. And then you—so, you graduated, and then you immediately got a job as a CNA? 
P: 
Yeah. The healthcare place where my friend worked at—they’re the ones that paid for the class—so, I 
went right to work for them. 
I: 
And you’ve been doing it ever since? 
P: 
Yes. I took a year off [laughs] in ’98 to think I wanted to be a stay-at-home mom. 
I: 
And how did that go? 
P: 
I started vacuuming the outside of my porch, so I figure it was time [laughing] I needed to go back to 
work [1.14.13]. 
I: 
So, you went back to home care? 
P: 
Yeah. Same boss, same everything. 
I: 
At some point, you ended up in Michigan? 
P: 
Yes. Came back to Michigan in, good lord, goodness—’94? Went to work at a place called Mercy 
Pavilion. It’s now been torn down, but it was the same hospital I was born at, and they converted it to a nursing 
home. Started out there at $4.15. 
I: 
What year was that? 
P: 
Gosh, 1994? Yeah. 
I: 
So, that was here in Battle Creek? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Okay [laughs]. So, as a CNA what do you do for people? If I—pretend I know nothing about— 
P: 
For home care or— 
I: 
Yes, home care. 
P: 
For home care. 
I: 
Yes. 
P: 
What I do now as a rehab home health aide is I come into your home, you’ve had surgery, you’ve had a 
fall, you’ve had an illness, you’re very weak, you don’t feel strong enough to be able to do any type of personal 
care, and that’s your own personal care—not your household. Getting into a bathroom, getting into a shower 
safely. I assist with that. I do push you to do as much independently as possible [1.12.44]. 
I: 
That’s the rehab push? 
P: 
Yes. Yes.

I: 
Okay. You mentioned you have some special training? 
P: 
When I started in home care in 1995, I started with a company—actually, let me back up. Under Mercy 
Pavilion was Good Samaritan Hospice. I wanted to do that. The woman—love her. JC. Went down and talked 
to her. She would come up and see some of my patients who were on Hospice, and I was very interested, and 
she was very fair, and she said, “I cannot interview you if you’re working for Mercy Pavilion.” So, I quit. And I 
went down and told her. She interviewed me. She hired me. Hospice was not well known in homes then 
[1.11.45], not enough work. She said go see Visiting Nurse Services—CS. So, I went. I got hired. A few years 
later, Good Samaritan Hospice and VNS merged to make Lifespan [laughs], so I was able to watch that come 
together. So, now you’ve got a company that will do the rehab part, but also follow you right through to the end-
of-life, and you had to be cross-trained as an aide to do the rehab because it’s a different mindset. You go from 
teaching independence—not teaching. Let me back up. We’re not allowed to teach. Nope. Oh, how can I put 
this—to encourage independence, to end-of-life where you—you’re there for support for quality of life. And I did 
that until Bronson came in, and bought Lifespan, and they sold Hospice, and here I am now doing the rehab 
part. 
I: 
So, you did Hospice for many years. 
P: 
Many. 
I: 
And it sounds like you were drawn to that. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
What drew you to that? 
P: 
The caring part. I think I have this need to be needed, and I think those people who become an aide 
and stay an aide as long as I have, you do it truly because you need—you need to help people. That’s what 
you want. You have a want to do that. 
I: 
Hospice patients are sort of in a whole different category. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
You have to be able to deal with pending death. 
P: 
All the time. 
I: 
You’re comfortable with that? 
P: 
Absolutely. 
I: 
Can you talk—do you have any Hospice clients that you recall that—where the experience of working 
with them at end-of-life really touched you? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
Can you tell us a couple of stories? 
P: 
I have a family that I took care—the littlest—the baby daughter [1.09.33]—they’re all adults, but the 
baby was the one caring for the mom in the home, and she was taking the place of the mom as matriarch. The 
older sister didn’t take a leadership role, so I’m in this family. I finally meet the older sister. We’re standing at 
the bed, and the daughter is standing on one side holding her mom’s hand, and the mom stops breathing. 
Now, of course, I can’t pronounce, but the daughter said, “She’s not breathing.” So, I listened. I felt—no pulse. 
Five minutes I called my nurse, she said, “Okay. I will be out there. It’ll take me about 20 minutes to come out 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
3
to pronounce,” and the sister was in the other room—the oldest sister, and she just screamed out, “Momma,” 
and just fell apart, and I watched that woman take a breath, and even the youngest daughter looked at me like, 
“[Sucks breath in in surprise].” And I had the oldest daughter come out, and I said you’ve gotta give her 
permission to go, and I told the youngest daughter, you know, tell her that you’ll take care of your sister, and 
she did. And I watched that woman take a breath and a tear come out, and she was gone. [Laughing] so weird. 
I: 
Mmm. 
P: 
Yeah. [Laugh/cry]. 
I: 
She had a tear come out, so she started breathing again. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And kept breathing until— 
P: 
Until the permission- 
I: 
--the younger sister— 
P: 
Yup, assured her [1.07.43]. 
I: 
--that I’m going to take care— 
P: 
Take care— 
I: 
--of the older sister. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And then she died. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. And so, honestly, if you don’t believe in something greater than just death, you’re done, 
that you’ve got to. There’s gotta be something out there bigger. 
I: 
So, you were at, you know, such a poignant moment in all of their lives. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And made a pivotal difference. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Can you talk about that for a minute? What difference did you make? How does it make you feel? 
P: 
[Pause] to me it’s a privilege to be let into something so personal, and you become part of their family. 
There’s so many that I remember. Pictures that I have that families have given me. For the longest time I had a 
bed of forget-me-nots because my closure was going to the funeral and sitting in the back [1.06.31], so I could 
say my goodbye. I don’t ever look at the body ‘cause that’s not them, but I like to go and they always, at the 
end of the funeral, give you a flower packet of forget-me-nots, and I had a huge amount. I just quit planting’ em 
[laughs]. But yeah, it’s very—I can walk into Walmart—I had one lady—this poor girl—took care of her 
grandma, and I’m in Best Buy—going into Best Buy [laughing] with my husband and I hear my name. I’m 
horrible with names, but I never forget a face, and when I turned around this lady comes runnin’ at me, and it’s 
like—I saw—I knew her face. I did not know her name. Her grandma had a bluebird tattoo right here, and she 
had told her grandma she was gonna have one here, put on there, in memory of her grandma. And she was 
running to me to show it because her grandma had passed, and it was about a year later. So, things like that, 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18

you know, I can go into a grocery store and I’ll know their face. You know, it—in Menard’s getting kissed on the 
cheek because I took care of their father. It is—it’s—I love Hospice. 
I: 
Do you plan to go back to it? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
No? Why not? 
P: 
[Pause] there’s not a lotta opportunities. I loved Good Samaritan Hospice. That’s been disbanded. I 
loved what Good Samaritan Hospice stood for. It was a family environment. I mean they knew my children. My 
supervisor was probably the third person to hold my youngest daughter, and it’s just gotten so much like a 
business now. The caring isn’t there [1.04.24]. Everybody’s so worried about offending this one or, “Oh, we 
can’t tell you that this person you’ve worked with for 20 years is in the hospital.” They’re family! So, it’s just not 
there. 
I: 
So, now, you focus on rehab. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Getting people better. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
More independent. 
P: 
And that’s kind of rewarding [laughing] ‘cause the only time I left a home with Hospice was at the end-
of-life. Now, I leave the home because they get cranky and tell me they don’t need me, and that’s totally fine. 
I: 
So, tell me about the range of assistance that you provide? For the Hospice— 
P: 
Hundred percent. 
I: 
A 100%, but it wasn’t just about the physical care, obviously. 
P: 
No. 
I: 
It was— 
P: 
Spiritual. 
I: 
You know, the story you just told was very spiritual. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
--and emotional. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hospice was different [1.03.33]. I could go in and with Hospice you can go into a 
nursing home. With rehab, no because rehab—if you go into a nursing home they have aides there. They don’t 
need you to go in, but with Hospice you give that person that one-on-one, that one-on-one attention. And it 
may not be a bath. I had one lady who was blind. Well, they just kept putting her birthday cards and letters 
from her grandson that was in prison, just kept proppin’ em up. Well, she can’t see ‘em [laughs], so I would 
read. I’d read her cards. I’d read the letters to her. You do a whole lotta different things. 
I: 
And your story also illustrates it’s not just about the client or patient, it’s about the family as well. 
P: 
Oh, absolutely. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
5
I: 
Can you talk about that for a few minutes? 
P: 
You can go in, especially in the Hospice side—on rehab you have to—it’s a hurry, hurry, get in, get out. 
It’s about the patient, time constraints, you know, time is money—time is money. With Hospice, I could go in 
and the patient could be sleeping, but the wife is breaking down. Well, I can go make her a cup a tea, get her a 
glass of water, give her a hug, hold her hand, talk her through it. The way I used to deal with it was make ‘em 
laugh. Tell ‘em funny stories about my kids, my dogs, my family, just try to get them out of that for a moment, 
and it helps [1.01.52]. 
I: 
So, there’s that side of things, and just the little things that you talked about, those are great examples. 
All the way to total care, and how would you describe total care to somebody? 
P: 
Ohh, total care is when they’re comatose. They can’t do anything, so you are turning them, dressing 
them, washing their hair. Everything’s done in the bed. Washing their hair, washing their body, lotioning them 
up, and by that time, when you have a great doctor, and they refer you to Hospice, they refer you early enough 
to where I go in and we can have a conversation like that. So, now I know their favorite lotion. I know that they 
don’t like their feet rubbed. I know they like their hair brushed this way. I know they like—this is their favorite 
shirt. So, when they become comatose, they can go into that transition knowing a 100% that I know them. 
They feel comfortable. They know I’m gonna take care of their wife or husband or daughter or son, so you 
have a lotta trust. So, when they become totally helpless you just keep doing it for them, and I talk to ‘em. I 
don’t sing because even my grandchildren don’t want me [laughing] to sing, but— 
I: 
But you read. You tell stories. 
P: 
I read. I talk to ‘em, tell ‘em the day, tell ‘em about, you know, what my kids did. 
I: 
What’s the most difficult part of your job, most challenging? 
P: 
In the rehab? 
I: 
Yes. Home care. 
P: 
Home care. Ooh. It’s the caregivers. Some of them can be very mean. 
I: 
You mean— 
P: 
The lashing out. 
I: 
--your colleagues? 
P: 
No, no. 
I: 
What do you mean by the caregivers? 
P: 
The caregivers in the home. The family members [59.56]— 
I: 
Oh family. 
P: 
--if you will. Family or whomever they decide is gonna help them. They can be— 
I: 
So, the family caregivers. 
P: 
Ooh, yeah. 
I: 
Tell us about that. 
P: 
Oh, they—you’ll get the blame. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
6
I: 
For what? 
P: 
Anything. Anything. Anything. You can come in and say one thing that they didn’t wanna hear, and all 
of the stresses and all the pressure, they blow up. And you’re the brunt of it. 
I: 
Can you give us an example, just one story? 
P: 
Oh, I had one just recently—rehab. 
I: 
Tell us about it. 
P: 
They really can’t do the care at home. They need more help. Don’t want to—it’s a denial thing, and so I 
came in and said, oop just got a text from the nurse. She’s gonna be—oh, she’s not coming. Another nurse is, 
and oh, my, lord. The world came to an end [58.57]. Oh! 
I: 
What happened? 
P: 
She blew up on me. Just blew up—cursing and yelling, and as she’s cursing and yelling, she’s also 
cursing and yelling telling me that it’s not about me, [laughing] but it’s like, okay, but it kinda is ‘cause I’m the 
one standing here [laughing]. 
I: 
How did you handle that? What do you do? 
P: 
Well, unfortunately, I’m German and Irish, with a little Native American added in, so I don’t deal with 
getting the blame very well, and I told her, this has nothing to do with me. I didn’t do it! And she kept saying, “I 
know. I know.” And I just left. Pulled into a grocery store and cried [laughs] ‘cause it hurts me because when 
you think you have a rapport with someone it’s like a slap in the face. And when I went back, she apologized, 
but that changed the—just the complete dynamics is gone. The trust is gone for me, if that makes sense. 
I: 
Mmm hmm, and it sounds like that’s happened more than once? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. I can handle it. It’s weird because when I was younger I would handle it better, and I think a 
lot of this because it was more of a Hospice situation, I get it. This—now, what I’m seeing are people that 
because they’re not taking care of themselves, and they’re not being—there’s no accountability, and they have 
no responsibility to take care of themselves [57.21]. They wanna blame everybody else. 
I: 
So, the family caregivers are a challenge. 
P: 
[Laughing] yes. 
I: 
Typical. What else is difficult about your job? Anything, you know, whether it’s physical, emotional, the 
physical environment? 
P: 
Just the scary part of it. 
I: 
What’s scary? 
P: 
We’re in the home alone. We have no protection. A cell phone, that’s not gonna help me a whole lot 
[laugh], I mean if someone goes on the attack, what do I do? There’s nothing I can do. I can call 911, and 
hopefully they get there quickly before anything bad happens, but you know, it makes [pause]—I [laughs] don’t 
like facilities. I’m not a good person to work in a nursing home. I don’t like having someone right here. I chose 
home care. Unfortunately, the protection is gone also. And when I’m out there on my own I don’t think people 
understand how difficult it can be. I don’t have—when I’ve got a four, five hundred-pound person, I don’t have 
all the lifts. And I’m the only one there. I’ve gotta roll, turn that person, help that person stand up. I’ve gotta 
reach into places that person can’t reach [55.51]. A lotta people will—dogs. Oh, my, lord, dogs! “Oh, he doesn’t 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
7
bite.” Well, does he know he doesn’t bite? His hair’s standing up, he’s showing me his teeth. I’m not moving. 
Put your dog up, and even though that is put in to our plan of care, you’re dogs have to be put up, you would 
not [laughing] believe the amount of people, “Oh, he doesn’t bite.” Tell my ankle [laughs]. 
I: 
Can you give us an example of a situation that was—for example the—you mentioned somebody who’s 
heavy and needs a lot of help lifting, and it’s just you out there. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
It’s not like there’s a staff for you to call on for help, have you walked into a situation that you felt like 
you couldn’t handle it? 
P: 
Oh, no. 
I: 
No? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
You’ve always figured out how to handle it? 
P: 
You have to. 
I: 
How do you do that? 
P: 
I—you just have to pull it from underneath [54.43]. I mean you have to. 
I: 
So, there’s—you have some natural problem-solving skills. It sounds like creative problem solving? 
P: 
Well, you either have that—you have to have the ability to be a chameleon, fit in into any environment, 
any class of people, any religion, any physical need, you have to become a chameleon, or you will fail at this 
job, I believe. I do. And I’m good. 
I: 
You’re good at being a chameleon? 
P: 
I am. I do believe that. I can go into a home where they don’t know me and make them feel comfortable 
on the first visit enough for them to completely disrobe, let me get close enough to help them in. 
I: 
Do you think that’s something that can be taught? 
P: 
No. Oh, no. 
I: 
That’s just who you are? 
P: 
Yes. I think any aide that can do that is a successful aide. Unfortunately, you can’t consider being an 
aide as a career like I have. 
I: 
And why can’t you? 
P: 
The pay stinks! 
I: 
Okay. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
We’re gonna talk about that in just a moment. Okay. We’re gonna take a slight break [53.25]. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
K’s gonna do something. I’m gonna leave this on. Think about the stories—you have so many stories— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18

P: 
I do, and it’s like— 
I: 
Think about the ones that you want most to tell. You know, are there some that are really—that really 
illustrate well some of the major issues that we’re talking about here. You’ve gotta lot of years to draw on. 
P: 
I’ve got one in particular where I was pushed up against the wall and went home with a hand print on 
my thigh. 
I: 
Okay. Wow. We’ll come back to that one. 
P: 
Yeah [laughs]. Now, it’s not so bad because, again, Bronson is just fantastic. If I don’t feel safe, I don’t 
go. 
I: 
You just call ‘em up, you call your supervisor— 
P: 
Yup. 
I: 
--from wherever you are— 
P: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
--and they say, just leave? 
P: 
“If you don’t feel safe [52.30] leave.” I mean Bron—again, I just can’t—and I know it [laughing] sounds 
horri—it’s sounds like a commercial, but I’ve never had that. 
I: 
Actually, we will come back to that, too. 
I2: 
I’m ready to go. 
I: 
Okay? All right. So, let’s shift gears just a little bit and talk about some different scenarios that you have 
faced. Just to, again, pretend I know nothing about home care, and you’re enlightening me. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
I’m the public, and I need to know. And you have so many stories. You started to tell a story about—
you were talking about feeling unsafe, and situations in which you were facing danger, can you tell us that 
story? 
P: 
When you go into a home alone, again, it’s alone. It doesn’t matter what house it is because if you’re 
sick, healthcare doesn’t discriminate. And I was in a home with a paralyzed gentleman, and this was years and 
years ago, who’s brother was a drug addict. I would go in and help the brother, the one that was paralyzed. 
And I had been in there for a few weeks, and then the brother—the drug addict happened to start showin’ up, 
and my patient told me, “Just ignore him. You know, he doesn’t come in or anything.” And one day he did 
come in, and he shoved me up against a wall and as the patient’s yelling his name, saying, “Stop, stop, no, 
no,” and he eventually stopped. But it was very, very scary. 
I: 
I’m sure. 
P: 
Extremely scary [50.33]. 
I: 
Well, why did he do that? What was he trying to do? 
P: 
I don’t know. I walked away with a handprint on my thigh, so I don’t know. I don’t wanna know. But we 
never went back. 
I: 
So, you reported him? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18

P: 
Oh, yes. 
I: 
To your supervisor? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Okay. Not the police? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
Okay. And the supervisor just pulled— 
P: 
Pulled. 
I: 
--everybody from that job? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Okay. You also mentioned that in your current job with Bronson, they’re extremely supportive. 
P: 
Absolutely. 
I: 
And how important that is to you. Can you explain that? 
P: 
They have zero tolerance policy. 
I: 
For what? 
P: 
Any violence [49.49]—verbal, emotional—any abuse whatsoever towards their employees. Employee 
on employee, or employee and patients. And it’s had to be [laughing] utilized. And they support—the support 
they give is awesome. I mean not every—there’s no company that doesn’t have it’s own problems, but from 
where I stand—and I haven’t worked at a lot a different places, but Bronson by far gives me better support than 
I’ve ever had. 
I: 
And that’s important? 
P: 
Oh, very. You have to. I mean I could leave in the morning and not come home. I go into people’s 
homes, their private homes, and what’s waiting beyond that door, I don’t know. 
I: 
Have you ever experienced sexual harassment or inappropriate sexual behavior? 
P: 
I, you know what, I have not. But I don’t get offended easily. Again, I think that’s with being a 
chameleon, and don’t feel like I’ve ever been in harms way. The only thing that ever happened was when I 
rolled a patient [laughing] towards me to wash his back and started washing his bottom and he started rubbing 
mine, and I just kinda asked what he was doing, and he said, “You’re rubbin’ mine, I’m rubbin’ yours.” It’s like, 
okay. 
I: 
How did you handle that? 
P: 
I just laughed, said, well, I’m done. He goes, “Okay. I will too.” All right [laughs]. 
I: 
And that was that, huh? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, this idea of never knowing what you’re gonna get into the need to be a chameleon, when you were 
talking about that, you said you sort a need to fit in with all different cultures [47.48]—

Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18

P: 
Oh, yes. 
I: 
--and so there has to be some acceptance. Have you ever run into a situation where the people—had 
beliefs or value systems or lifestyles completely different than your own? 
P: 
[Laughing] oh, I hunt. Okay. I shoot a bow. There are so many people that are against [laughing] that, 
so I, yeah. There are people that are against that, but then when I tell them what I do, and that I eat my own 
food, they then become—they’re curious. “You shoot a bow?” Yes, I do, so does my husband, so did all my 
daughters. I mean we at one time had a line of all the kids and me shootin’ longbows at a big olé target. Of 
course, with my husband puffed up, but yeah. It’s so, yeah. There’s a lot that—but it’s taught me how to accept 
people who if I didn’t do this job I’d probably be so close-minded it’d be horrible [46.42]. 
I: 
I’m just thinking of the importance of a personal care worker needing to be that open-minded— 
P: 
You have to. 
I: 
And accepting and not pass judgment. I mean you have to sort of maintain objectivity. 
P: 
We’ll you’re not there to—like I tell my patients. I’m not the bath police. I’m not—I don’t care if you take 
a bath. I’m here to make sure you’re doin’ it safe, not how you’re doing it. If you wanna wash the way you 
wanna wash, this your life the way you wanna live—I’m not in here to change it all. I’m just here to make sure 
that you’re safe. 
I: 
So, let’s talk about safety for a moment because a lot of the policies and regs are around patient safety, 
and trying to keep the clients safe, but then you need to be safe as well. 
P: 
Do we? [Laughing] 
I: 
I wish I could capture that expression on a tape, but you’re questioning that? 
P: 
Bronson cares. I don’t believer Medicare surveyors or JACO gives a crap. 
I: 
Really? 
P: 
Really. 
I: 
Why do you say that? 
P: 
I mean it’s what I’ve seen [45.25]. 
I: 
I’m curious about what you’ve seen, but I’m wondering what—have you—do you worry about injury? 
Have you ever been injured? 
P: 
No. Well, no, I take that back. My Achilles made this horrible crunching sound when I was trying to 
move a bed on carpet, and I stopped, and what the doctor said is it looked like my Achilles had been through a 
cheese grater. So, then I had to wear the lovely black boot and be off work, so that’s it. I shut my own hand in 
my own car [laughing] door. 
I: 
Do you worry about injury? 
P: 
I do now that I’m getting older, but I worked with—and I still do—work with great OTs and PTs, and I 
will not lift if I don’t feel comfortable assisting—anything. 
I: 
So, you take a lot of precautionary measures. 
P: 
Yeah. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
11
I: 
And, of course, if you do get injured, as you said, you can’t work. 
P: 
No. 
I: 
You need your body for this kinda work. 
P: 
Oh, pff, yeah. 
I: 
If you can’t work, there’s no income. 
P: 
You get long-term or short-term disability, but it’s only a percentage of what you get. 
I: 
Through the company—through your company. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Okay, so if you’re not affiliated with a company that offers that? 
P: 
Then you’re screwed. 
I: 
You’re screwed. 
P: 
Because don’t nobody care about ya. You’re an aide [43.58]. 
I: 
Expand on that last comment just for a moment. You’re an aide. It’s almost like you’re just [inaudible]— 
P: 
That’s it.  
I: 
So, talk about that for a minute. 
P: 
You’re just an aide. You’re just a butt-wiper. You wash asses for a livin’. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Does that bother you? That attitude? 
P: 
Yeah. Because you know what, you’re the one that stuck your parents in a nursing home, or you’re the 
one that lives down the street and you can’t take time out, but I’m coming in, and you’re gonna treat me like I’m 
just that—a throwaway person. 
I: 
The attitude feels like it’s a throwaway person? 
P: 
Oh,  yeah. Well, we are. 
I: 
That’s the message you get from— 
P: 
Oh, yeah. Oh, from, you know, from starting in 1993. You get some nurses, and it’s usually those 
nurses who have been aides themselves, who are, “Oh, you are awesome. You know, we couldn’t do our job 
without you,” and then you’ll get the newer nurses that just—they’re the boss [laughs]. They look—they make 
you feel like they’re looking down their nose at you [42.38]. 
I: 
Can you give some example? 
P: 
I have some clinicians I can say, oh, my goodness. Or this lady’s urine is very cloudy, and there’s a 
definite order. She has a temperature. There is a UTI goin’ on, and then that nurse—if it’s that nurse, she’ll go, 
“Oh, I’ll call the doctor and get a—” okay. Then you’ll get other nurses that—I’ve actually had this happen. I’ll 
take all the vitals, and literally I’m putting everything in my bag, the nurse ‘ll walk in. Oh, I’ve got vitals for ya. 
“I’ll take my own.” All right. 
I: 
So, even within your own profession, you know, colleagues who are treating you like that— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
12
P: 
Oh, yeah. [Laughing] yeah. 
I: 
And then outside of the profession, just like family members or the general public? 
P: 
My mom told me. “You are so smart. I don’t know why you won’t go to college to be a nurse.” ‘Cause I 
don’t wanna be a nurse! 
I: 
Why don’t you wanna be a nurse? 
P: 
[Sigh] nurses don’t get as much one-on-one that I get. They don’t get to know my patients like I know 
‘em. 
I: 
You prefer the one-on-one— 
P: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
--and if you went on to be a nurse, you wouldn’t have that? 
P: 
No. All nurses have to do now, paperwork, computer work. You know, they can’t afford to spend time 
with the [laughing] patients [41.14] because they have like a stack of paperwork to do. That’s ridiculous.  
I: 
That doesn’t appeal to you? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
So, you felt, even from your own mother then, this— 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Okay. Glorified butt wiper you said. 
P: 
Yeah. Mmm hmm. What was I called at one point? Enema queen. 
I: 
Oh, that’s a new one. 
P: 
Uh-huh. Family members would call me. My aunt called me and said, “Hey, can you come over and 
help? Your uncle needs—I’m having troubling rolling your uncle.” Because in Hospice if you rolled ‘em then 
they usually would die [laughing], so it was like, oh, [laughing] okay. I mean I’m not saying they don’t love me, 
but I don’t think they even understand what I do—everything I do. I know my grandmother does ‘cause I took 
care of her best friend. And I think that opened my grandma’s eyes a lot. 
I: 
What would happen to these people in home care if you didn’t exist? If PCAs didn’t exist? What would 
happen to them? 
P: 
Oh, good, lord. Oh, my, gosh, you mean even in nursing homes or just homecare? 
I: 
Homecare, yeah. 
P: 
Just like the prisons, there’d be overpopulation [laughs] in nursing homes. 
I: 
They’d be unable to stay at home? 
P: 
Oh, gosh, no. No, no. No. Nope. There’s no way [39.37]. 
I: 
Can you explain that a little bit more? Why is that? 
P: 
[Sigh] there’s personal care service, which is not paid for by insurance. It’s gotta be private pay, and it’s 
expensive. So, I’d really like to see insurance cover that, because with that and with me—rehab part—that 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
13
comes in to make sure safety’s there, the therapies come in, the nursing comes in. These people could 
actually live at home longer if they had a chore provider and all that. You take all of that away, they live alone. 
They can’t walk safely. I mean the ambulation is not there. They can’t cook their meals, so where would they 
go? Family don’t wanna take ‘em. 
I: 
People seem to—we get this message that the important work is the physical assistance that you’re 
providing, but you mentioned chore services and meals— 
P: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
--and, you know, if people stop for a moment and thought, “Oh, well, what would happen if I had no way 
of fixing a meal?” How do you respond to people who say, “Well, how hard can it be to fix a meal?” 
P: 
[Laughing] [sigh] how I honestly respond? 
I: 
Mmm hmm. 
P: 
One day you’ll find out, and I will be the one to be there to help you, and then I’ll explain how hard it is. 
One of the best things that Lifespan did for me as an aide was they sent me and another aide to the rehab 
institute of Chicago, and there we had to—there were fake arms that we had to put on that mimic a stroke. You 
had to dress yourself. COPD, put a straw in your mouth, tape your nose shut. Walk around fast, see how you 
breath. So, now I know how these people feel [laughing], so when they say, “I need to rest ‘cause, you know, I 
can’t catch my breath.” Oh, it’s a rest, we’re stoppin’, you know, I can’t see this side because they had glasses 
you could put on and it mimicked all of it. You know, that type of training I wish family members had to do that. 
I wish nurses had to do that instead of just looking at it medically. Live it for a minute. Wear that 10-pound arm 
around [laughing] that won’t move and try to do things [36.56]. You know, you’re gonna like me a lot. 
I: 
That’s an extraordinary resource and a great idea. 
P: 
They don’t do that kinda training anymore. 
I: 
Talk about the importance of training. I mean that training sounds invaluable. How about other training 
for personal care aides? What kind of training do they need? 
P: 
I think self-defense should be mandatory. I think every company that has homecare that is going into 
homes, they need to be teaching some self-defense just in case. You don’t know, so self-defense. I don’t know 
how to teach someone how to get along with everybody, but see I think a lot of young people, now, it’s a 
stepping-stone job. You know, it’s like a MacDonald’s job. You know, you go to MacDonald’s when you’re in 
high school. Well, from there you go on, and I think that’s what’s happening now, again, it’s with the pay. You 
know, why are you gonna stay in a job where you work your fanny off—you are physically tired, you’re 
emotionally tired, you’re mentally tired. And Michigan’s one of the lowest paying states, and their economy is 
one of the highest. I mean it’s like, that doesn’t make sense. 
I: 
You know, we’ve talked about what’s happening inside the house, but I’m reminded of several stories 
we’ve heard, being in Michigan, you know, we have these winters. 
P: 
Ooh.  
I: 
And just even getting to and from a patient’s house or a client’s house, especially in some of the more 
rural areas can be challenging. 
P: 
Yeah. That’s when you’ve gotta rely on your patients. A lot of ‘em will say, “Look. My road’s not been 
plowed. I don’t want ya here. I had one lady that hit me with a cane when I walked in her door because all she 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
14
saw was snowflakes and she was worried. There wasn’t even an accumulation [laughing] but bless her heart. 
You get some that care really. 
I: 
She was mad at you for coming? 
P: 
Oh, yes, because she thought I put myself in jeopardy [laughs] [34.36]. 
I: 
What if they have to have you there? 
P: 
There is no such thing as life and death, no. Not for a rehab aide, not even Hospice aide. I mean it’s 
bathing. I mean let’s put it where it is. We are important, but when it comes to our safety, there’s no such thing 
as an emergency bath. 
I: 
Okay, so if you don’t show up somebody’s life is not in danger? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
Okay. But you try to show up anyway? 
P: 
Oh, yeah.  
I: 
Even if it— 
P: 
I would. Oh, my goodness. My parents instilled a work ethic that won’t quit. I cannot call in just to call in. 
I never had a mental day [laughs]. 
I: 
So, if there’s a blizzard outside? 
P: 
I try. 
I: 
You try to get there? 
P: 
This is the way I look at it. If I can get down my street, I might as well try. 
I: 
So, you get there and maybe their driveway’s inaccessible? 
P: 
Well, I find a safe place to park, and walk it. 
I: 
Trudge in. 
P: 
Yup. I wear my boots, and I have my tenny’s in a little bag, and we’re walkin’ [laughs]. 
I: 
You mentioned you’ve been doing this for so long in this area you never use the highways anymore. 
P: 
No. 
I: 
You know all the back roads. 
P: 
Yes. 94 is horrible. Even on fair-weather days [33.16]. Accident here, accident there and that’s from 
distracted driving, and there’s no way I’m gonna—my life is worth more than what I get paid an hour. 
I: 
Do you get paid mileage? 
P: 
Oh, yes. 
I: 
You do. 
P: 
Bronson pays us extremely well. 
I: 
So, they pay for that time plus mileage? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
15
P: 
Yes. Plus, mileage. 
I: 
Travel time between clients. 
P: 
Absolutely. 
I: 
Okay. How many clients do you see in a week? 
P: 
Oh, in a week it depends. My caseload will go up and down. Tomorrow I could—yeah, tomorrow, 
Monday, could open it up. I could have six news on it or I could have none, so I can do six, seven a day or I 
can have two. It all depends [32.34]. 
I: 
Some people would not be comfortable or able to live with that not knowing what’s happening 
tomorrow, you know. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
Having to be that— 
P: 
Flexible. But see flexibility is why I like this. I never missed any of my children’s school plays, 
conferences, nothin’ ‘cause I could flex. 
I: 
So, you get to create your own schedule? 
P: 
Yes. I schedule myself, and I have to do it—now, I have to do it because Bronson at Home is huge! I 
mean 12 counties. I mean I believe it’s 12, 13 maybe, and there’s me—I’m full time, and then there’s an aide 
that’s part-time. I work from 131 to our eastern borders—north and south. 
I: 
So, that’s a plus, is that flexible schedule? 
P: 
Oh, it has to be. 
I: 
Doing it yourself? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And— 
P: 
I’ve gotta travel all in one little circle ‘cause I won’t crisscross it. That’s just not good. That’s just not 
good. You’re wastin’ a lotta time, so if I’ve got Portage people, I try to do all my Portage people in this day. My 
Battle Creek people this day [31.28]. 
I: 
And then it’s kind of up to you to make sure you get enough hours to make ends meet? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
To get the income that you need. 
P: 
Well, sometimes I get it and sometimes I don’t. They’ve actually put in place—because we went 
through a period of very low census that now if I’m not gonna make my hours, I can come in and clean dirty 
equipment so that I will get my hours. I mean they’re good to me. Bronson is good. 
I: 
So, they work with you? 
P: 
Oh, yes. 
I: 
To get the hours that you need— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
16
P: 
Oh, absolutely. 
I: 
--and if there aren’t enough clients— 
P: 
Clients right. 
I: 
--during the hours that you prefer. 
P: 
Yeah. Well, no it’s—my hours are 8 to 4:30, and I work within them. Sometimes it’s a little more. 
Sometimes I have to start later [30.41]. It just depends. 
I: 
Five days a week? 
P: 
Yes. Yes [laughing] first time I didn’t have to work weekends or holidays [laughing]. 
I: 
Well, that’s another issue, right? 
P: 
It is. Yes. I went years working holidays. I never—it was Christmas in-home care. Very—you might be 
working Christmas. Nobody wanted ya there, they had their family there. Gosh, since ’93, not ’95 until 2012 
[laughs], I worked every Thanksgiving, and then another holiday. And when I had my first Thanksgiving off, I 
didn’t know what to do. 
I: 
You take out your bow and you get a turkey. 
P: 
Yeah, no. I don’t like turkey [laughing]. 
I: 
So, yeah, because people need help 7-days a week. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
They don’t take a day off. 
P: 
No. Rehab’s a little different. Hospice, no, but rehab is different [29.26]. You can go a weekend without 
[laughs]. 
I: 
We’re gonna take a little pause right there. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
And, again, think about the stories that I’m missing. ‘Cause this next segment we’re gonna talk about 
the larger context, and what the world needs to know, and how we can—‘cause we have this shortage, right, of 
workers? And we need to find a way to get more workers, make it more appealing. So, just give that a little bit 
of thought. 
P: 
It just comes down to the same thing. It’s the money thing. They get paid lots a money to do nothin’. 
I: 
We’ll talk about that in just a second. 
P: 
It’s just not a glory job. 
I: 
It’s not a glory job. 
P: 
No, it is not [28.26] [laughing]. Yeah, no. You can’t go to work with full makeup on and expect to come 
home clean [laughs]. 
I: 
‘Cause you have everything at home too? 
P: 
Hmm? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
17
I: 
You have everything thing at home as well. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Let us know when you’re ready. 
I2: 
I’m ready. 
I: 
Okay. There’s so many things I want to ask you, K, about, you know, we touched on a lotta things 
about the role—the value our society places on personal care workers, and as you know, we have this critical 
shortage right now. And we have to find a way to get more people into this line of work. It’s kind of hard to do 
that for a number of reasons, and you’ve mentioned pay a couple of times. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Can you talk about the pay? 
P: 
It stinks. You cannot raise a family. You can’t work, be a single person, and even pay rent and utilities, 
and good God if you get sick. No. And you know, you’re doing so much for so little. I don’t blame people for not 
wanting to get in it. 
I: 
Even if they would really like to they can’t afford— 
P: 
Yeah. They can’t afford it. No. 
I: 
And you can afford to because? 
P: 
I really couldn’t. I made sacrifices.  
I: 
Like what? 
P: 
No, telephone, no cable [26.48], no TV. If you can’t pay it, you don’t have it. 
I: 
And right, now, you mentioned you’re able to make it because your husband is employed? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
So, you have more— 
P: 
I have a second—yeah. 
I: 
--second income— 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
--coming into the household— 
P: 
But if I didn’t, pfff, no. 
I: 
So, the basics like, you know, cable or probably let alone going to get an ice cream. 
P: 
Oh, yeah, no. I thought no, no, no. Before I met my husband, my and my three kids, we would go quite 
a while without meat. You do what you do. Eat a lotta potatoes. My mother found out and would come to pick 
up the kids to spend time with ‘em and take ‘em grocery shoppin’ [25.52] and be gone before I got home 
because she knew I would be upset. 
I: 
And come back with groceries? 
P: 
Stocked full. My son would be cooking [laughs]. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
18
I: 
What about benefits? 
P; 
Such as healthcare? 
I: 
Sure. Vacation days anything— 
P: 
Oh [laughing] ha, vacation days. 
I: 
That’s funny? 
P: 
Yeah. Even if you take a day off, this is what you do. ‘Cause you can’t afford to go anywhere. You just 
can’t. And I don’t—I mean that is all across America with every job, but it just seems for the amount of work 
that you are expected to do, you get paid lousy. I mean it—uk—I don’t wanna. An office worker, and I know this 
for a fact, a scheduler gets paid more than I do, and I have patient care. Basically, and they’re lives are in my 
hands. They pass out, quit breathing, I gotta do CPR. They get paid more than I do, excuse me. 
I: 
How much do you think personal care workers should make? What would be a good living wage? 
P: 
I can’t answer that because even what I make right now, as expensive as everything is, I couldn’t live 
on my own if it wasn’t for my husband. And I don’t make stupid decisions. I make about $16—I think it’s 
about—a little over $16. Maybe close to $17. I don’t know, but with this many years in, being an aide since 
1993, I really expected [laughing] that I would be able to maybe call this a career instead of, it’s just a job. 
I: 
So, you don’t get paid very much. You don’t feel respected, that’s a pretty hard sell. 
P: 
Exactly. 
I: 
How do we convince people to make a career out of this? 
P: 
You have to—you have to change the attitude of how we’re treated. You know, it started out at one time 
[23.25] I could—one of my favorite things is wound care. At Lifespan they had, and this was years ago when 
Medicare would allow it. We could go and do simple wound care, and it’s amazing to watch the body heal itself. 
And, you know, we couldn’t do things like put prescription ointments on. I get it. I’m not a nurse. I don’t know 
what the—anything would happen. I couldn’t do any packing of the wounds. I didn’t wanna do that, but I could 
change, cleanse. One, it does save the company a lotta money to send me out instead of an RN, right? Well, 
then, Medicare came in and said, no, you can’t do that anymore. Okay. Adoderm, no medication on it. It’s like a 
big flat icky band-aid, sticky thing that you put on. I don’t care for them. We used to be able to put those on. 
Nope, can’t do that. 
I: 
Who says you can’t do that? 
P: 
Medicare guidelines. They have dumbed us down to the point where it’s insulting. I am—I happen to 
work with a group of nurses, and therapists that if I ask a question they will stop what they’re doing and explain 
it to me until I know. And it’s that—knowledge is wonderful. We can work as a well-oiled team, but I can’t do 
anything because I’m an aide. Even though I’m there a lot. 
I: 
You sound a little frustrated. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Like there are things you could do, or you do know how to do that you’re just not allowed to do— 
P: 
Exactly.  
I: 
--because of regulations. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18 
 
19
P: 
Nystatin powder—nystatin powder, that is a powder for yeast infections. I’m not an idiot. I know it 
doesn’t go in her mouth [21.12], but I cannot powder them. So, anybody that has a yeast infection underneath 
that apron or their breasts or their underarms, I have to go, wait a minute. Excuse me, could you come in here 
and do this ‘cause I’m too stupid to do it. 
I: 
So, those kinds of things can only be done by a nurse, an RN? 
P: 
A family member can do it, but I can’t. [Laughs] what is this? “It’s Nystatin.” What’s it for? “It’s for yeast. 
I could do this?” Yes, you can. “But you can’t?” No. But—yes, I know. 
I: 
Must be frustrating. 
P: 
It’s humiliating. I mean when you have someone go, “Well, what can you do?” Well, I can do a lot, but 
it’s not legal [laughing]. It’s ridiculous. You know, we’re not dumb individuals. There are a lot of in-services out 
there. There are a lotta companies like Bronson—Lifespan did that with the wound care team. You get a 
specialized team. You get all the training that you need. You know, just because this hand full or this shady 
group over here did it, don’t condemn all of us because you can have some really good team members 
focused around patient care [19.48], but they’re gonna talk more to me than they are to their nurse. 
I: 
You made the point that if you were able to do those kinds of things it would be much more cost-
effective. 
P: 
Well, yeah. You know, I know I don’t get paid what the [laughing] nurse does. So, if you’ve got a patient 
that has wound care for instance, and basically the wound care is you put a Mepilex on or let’s say you have to 
use an aquacel, you have to put some ointment—prescription ointment on, and then wrap it. The nurse is 
comin’ out three times a week to do that. Well, why can’t I go out two of those days and the nurse not? You’ve 
just saved yourself how much money? Now, with Bronson we can put like a Mepilex ‘cause there’s no 
medication, but the nurse every single patient [laughing] has to do a face-to-face so that Medicare will say it’s 
okay. Because evidently putting on a puffy bandage like Mepilex changes from patient to patient, and I don’t 
know. I don’t understand that. 
I: 
You don’t agree? 
P: 
But I’m just an aide. No, I don’t. It’s like a Band-Aid. You know, but they’ll let me put a Band-Aid on, but 
I can’t put a Mepilex on [laughing]. 
I: 
It doesn’t make sense to you? 
P: 
It’s stupid. 
I: 
You’re already answering this question, but I wanna hear you expand a little bit. One of my questions is 
what changes need to be made? What do you want to tell the policymakers and the feds? 
P: 
Back off. Let us do our job. We’re healthcare workers. We are keeping the costs down by keeping 
patients in their home, but you are tying our hands. Pay us more. Give us the training. I was a CNA, of course I 
had to be certified, and I let it lapse. I was with Lifespan, not goin’ anywhere. I asked my boss; do I really need 
to spend the extra money that I have to pay to keep my certification? “Well, are you goin’ anywhere?” No. 
“Okay.” So, I let it lapse. You know, now, in order to get it, even though I’ve been an aide since 1993, I have to 
go back and take a 2-week course that’s 8 hours a day. 
I: 
And costs how much? 
P: 
Over $700. 
I: 
And then the license itself cost money too, right?

P: 
Mmm hmm. It’s not a license. Get that right. 
I: 
Oh, excuse me. 
P: 
It’s a certification. 
I: 
Oh, you can’t call it a license? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
And that’s— 
P: 
I can’t even—and that’s another thing. The words you have to use are stupid. Medicare’s oooh! Getting 
a person in and out of a shower the correct way, the safe way, takes a little bit a teachin’, correct? I can’t say 
I’m teaching them. Evidently because I’m just an aide I’m too dumb to teach someone. 
I: 
What can you call that? What do you call it? 
P: 
I assist. 
I: 
And that’s Medicare? 
P: 
Yeah. Those are guidelines, yes. 
I: 
You mentioned JACO? 
P: 
Oooh. 
I: 
You have something to say about JACO? 
P: 
Mmm, not impressed. I understand. I understand why it’s gotta be there. I understand why the 
guidelines are there, but I also think they need to quit lumping us [15.56] all into one lump. Every—I’m getting 
loud. 
I: 
Good. 
P: 
Every [laughing] healthcare place is different. They need to look at it as an individual. You know, 
Bronson at Home, we’re not shady. We do good—God, we do everything on the up and up, so don’t condemn 
us because someone in New York fraudulently charged Medicare over $4 million dollars. That’s not—we didn’t 
do that, so don’t put those stupid guidelines on us. Look at us as an individual agency. 
I: 
So, that’s at the agency level, if we bring it down to the PCA level for a few minutes, and I’m trying to 
put the JACO hat on or the Medicare hat on, how do we make sure that people get a certain—a sufficient 
standard of care? You know, that they’re safe, that they’re getting good care. How do we assure them about 
the PCAs? 
P: 
Training. The training. They’ve gotta have good instinct. I went out with a JACO, hoo, hoo, JACO 
surveyor. Nerve wracking. We then had a lady come in who was awesome who gave me guidelines on how to 
take control of the JACO meeting when they go out into the field with me, which I didn’t know I could [14.25], 
but then I asked her a question. When it’s 90 degrees out, my patient is 80, she’s got her windows closed, it’s 
burning up in the house, she said she’s thirsty. It’s not on my care plan to give her a drink of water. Can I offer 
her one? “No. It’s not on your care plan.”  
I: 
What’d you say? 
P: 
Why not? She made a good point. “Well, we don’t know if she’s on fluid restrictions.” I would because 
[laughing] it would be on my care plan, you know, the precautions. That’s what Bronson does. I’m very

Kelli L. Holmgren. 6.10.18

educated on my patients, but if it’s not on the care plan, if this woman’s hungry, I can’t even give her something 
to eat. 
I: 
You know there’s such a disconnect between rigidly working according to what’s written down on paper 
and the—what’s actually happening in the house and the need for it to be so flexible and respond to different 
situations as they come up and all of the creative problem-solving, and you know, there’s such a disconnect. 
P: 
It is, and part of that is also the public’s fault. Everybody is so sue-happy. Everybody gets, you know, 
you can’t do this, you can’t do this. “Oh, mom stumbled. Well, it had to have been her fault. You know, the aide 
did it or the nurse did it [12.57]. So— 
I: 
They need to blame. 
P: 
Yeah. Blame yourself. Take care of your loved one yourself then. 
I: 
So, back to my question, it sounds like one thing you would recommend is for the aides—the PCAs to 
be treated as an important member of the team. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Be given some more responsibility, allowed to do some of these things. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
But in order to make sure that, you know, we had some kind of threshold that we could be sure that you 
were doing all of those things safely, we would need to have some training? 
P: 
Absolutely. Background checks are important also, and background checks are extremely important 
because you’re goin’ into someone’s house. It isn’t—I keep sayin’ it isn’t like a facility, and it isn’t. It’s 
completely separate, you know. The rules and regulations I feel are not adjusted for homecare. 
I: 
In what way? 
P: 
Well, I think it’s so rigid in a nursing home that it just flows right over into homecare. It’s almost like they 
don’t change their thoughts [11.31]. 
I: 
And homecare requires different rules and regulation? 
P: 
I think so ‘cause you’re dealing on one-on-one in their home environment. You know, we can go into a 
home, they could have bedbugs, but we not know. You go into a facility, they shut down at flu [laughs]. We 
don’t have that. 
I: 
So, you can’t—what I’m hearing is in a facility you can kind of control a lot of variables— 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
--whereas at home you really don’t have any control over [laughing]— 
P: 
No. 
I: 
--over all the variables— 
P: 
Nothing. 
I: 
--in situations that might arise. 
P: 
Right. They don’t even have to open the door for me, so I mean it’s [laughing], okay. And I’ve had that 
happen.

I: 
So, I’m getting this—I would love for you to just to cut loose. I mean we can’t see this on tape, but you 
have a lot of great expressions going on, and I can see the frustration in your voice in the fact that, you know, 
it’s kind of demeaning. It’s humiliating. 
P: 
It is. 
I: 
So, I would love for you just to cut loose, so get crazy for a minute and tell the world what you want to 
say about personal care work, and what you’re doing, the importance of it? 
P: 
I’m doing what the families don’t wanna do. I am [10;14]. I pointblank—I am doing all that yuck that you 
don’t wanna do. 
I: 
Or can’t do or don’t have the, you know— 
P: 
It’s usually don’t want to. 
I: 
And the yuck? 
P: 
Yeah. The [sigh], “Oh, I’m sorry I stood up. I strained too much. I am a mess now.” Well, okay, or I walk 
in and they’ve spilled their lunch all over them. It’s—and I’ve gotta be careful because some, you know, care 
plan—you have to follow your care plan. You have to. 
I: 
And I’m sure over all these years you’ve had probably some really positive family experiences as well? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. You can have very supportive families, but I’m not in those homes very long because they’re 
right there with mom and dad, gettin’ em up, gettin’ movin’. “Let’s do this.” You know, “Oh, I’ve got the bath 
now,” or “Mom, I got all the handles up. We can do that.” And then I go into the poor lady whose daughter lives 
two apartments down, she never sees her daughter. 
I: 
What would you say to let’s say a young person who’s thinking about doing this as a career? 
P: 
Don’t. Unless you’re gonna be a nurse, then it should be mandatory, but don’t. 
I: 
Because? 
P: 
You will never make a living. 
I: 
Because of the money? 
P: 
It’s because of the money [8.44]. As far as the job itself, you’ve gotta have a strong stomach. You’re 
gonna smell smells that you did not know existed. You are going to see things coming out of someone’s body 
that you did not know could happen. You’re gonna see limbs looking like nothing you thought a limb could look 
like [laughing]. You see and smell and hear and sometimes the smells are so strong you can taste ‘em, and if 
you cannot handle that, nope. Do not do it. 
I: 
So, you tell ‘em don’t do it, don’t do it, don’t do it. 
P: 
I told my daughter that.  
I: 
Really? What if she came back and said, “You know, ma, I hear ya. I’m doin’ it anyway.” What would 
your advice be? 
P: 
Don’t do it, or you better get a husband [laughing] that has a really good job, or just plan on not havin’ a 
life. 
I: 
What would you tell the policymakers? What are you gonna tell the policymakers?

P: 
Come out with me for a week. I would love that. 
I: 
What recommendations would you have for them? 
P: 
For homecare? 
I: 
Mmm hmm. 
P: 
If it’s for homecare, [laughs] to look at each agency individually. Do not condemn all for the mistakes of 
some. Look at the track record. When you’re in homes you cannot [laughs] guarantee safety. Like safety, 
perfect. The patient falls [6.57], we get held accountable. Not aides, but as an agency. If they’re in the home 
and they’re stubborn, I can’t tie ‘em down. So, the more falls or the more incidents we have, or they go to ER, 
we have no control over that, but yet, we get dinged for it. Our rating goes down, which I think is absolutely 
stupid because we give great care. So, like the age caps, that’s stupid.  
I: 
What’s age cap? 
P: 
You get—that’s how hospitals are getting paid because the patient got treated well, and so I have to 
kiss your butt while you are nasty to me in order for us to get our full payment. Well, that’s the way to pay. 
I: 
How should it be? 
P: 
It should be the care, not do you like us because there are a lotta people out there, like I said, that don’t 
wanna take responsibility for their own health. “Oh, my, goodness. Oh, my, goodness I’m short of breath. I’m 
short of breath.” You weigh 500 pounds, but you got to MacDonald’s and you’re drinking 2-liters of pop hand 
over fist. Take some responsibility. Do something to help yourself. That’s what we’re trying to do, but they’re 
not compliant [5.32], but we get dinged ‘cause they go back to the hospital. It shouldn’t be like that, again, 
there’s so much wrong with the health system, with Medicare. There’s so much. Insurance companies don’t 
wanna pay, and I know there’s fraudulent things that happen, but not all the time. 
I: 
So, we only have a few minutes left, I wanna ask you just a couple more questions. First of all, you said 
you have—and I’m sure this is true, you have so many stories, is there a story that you really wanted to tell 
coming into this interview that you haven’t yet? Are there some things I’ve missed? Some scenarios? 
P: 
[Pause] 
I: 
Maybe one of your favorite patients, one of your least favorite? 
P: 
Actually, it was a Hospice patient. And I’ll say his name. His name was big J. That’s what I called him. 
This man was huge—6’ 4”—huge. When I first met him, I did not like him. He did not like me. He did not need 
my help. I am a little girl, so we had a barking contest back and forth. He became my favorite patient. When my 
father died, he held me. He always told me he loved me, and I did not know this until his wife told me after his 
passing, he was a Shriner. So, here’s this huge man, now I’m picturing him in those little cars, and so we were 
talkin’ about that, and we were laughing so hard. She brought out the pictures of it, so which got me laughing 
even harder [3.40]. So, we laugh, and we laugh, and we always ended my visit with a hug. I went on vacation, 
and he passed away. And I went to the house, and his wife told me that he has never told his daughters that 
he loved ‘em, but he always told me every day ‘cause I was there daily, every day. He will never leave my 
heart, ever. And I’m still friends with her because I care—I really loved that man a lot ‘cause he helped me. 
I: 
So, you get a lot out of it from them, I mean you’re helping them, but it sounds like they’re also giving to 
you in some ways? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, they are. 
I: 
That must have been a hard one for you to lose.

P: 
Ooh, still is. 
I: 
How long ago was that? 
P: 
Oh, that was over 10 years. 
I: 
Wow, and you’re still— 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
--he’s still in your heart. 
P: 
Always. I’ll never forget him. 
I: 
It’s a beautiful story.  
P: 
Oh, he was just a goofy man in a funny hat, and a little tiny car. Still don’t know how that happens. 
I: 
Well, you clearly made a huge difference in his life, and— 
P: 
I hope so. 
I: 
--sounds like he made a big difference in yours. 
P: 
That’s my goal. 
I: 
One last question, just getting to put a human face and a human—so people know you’re a human 
being, right? And you’re not just a PCA. 
P: 
No. 
I: 
You’re not just a CNA. 
P: 
No. 
I: 
Can you just take like 1 minute and give us—in a few words just describe yourself as a whole person. 
P: 
Oh. 
I: 
Who are you? What kinda person are you? What do you like? 
P: 
I am just completely nutty. 
I: 
Nutty. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. I’ve got big-mouth kids, big-mouth grandkids that I love 100%. One of the best men in the 
world— 
I: 
Is your husband? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
You love bow-hunting? 
P: 
Yes. Ooh, yes, and he’s the one that got me into that, and I love my dog K, and my dog N. 
I: 
And you like the balloon festival? 
P: 
I like the balloons. I don’t like the people ‘cause I really don’t like people that much.

I: 
You don’t like people that much. 
P: 
Not big crowds, no. 
I: 
Isn’t that funny ‘cause you’re around people— 
P: 
It doesn’t make sense, does it? [Laughs] 
I: 
No. 
P: 
[Laughing] that’s what my patients say. I don’t like people, but I love my patients, but they need me. 
I: 
I wanna thank you again for being willing to give this interview and being so open with your feelings, 
and really thank you for the work that you do, which is very valuable. The work you’re doing is really important. 
P: 
Well, thank you. It was nice meeting you. 
I: 
It was great meeting you. 
P: 
And you. 
I2: 
Thank you. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
And I hope we’re gonna continue to stay in conversation. 
P: 
I hope so. 
I: 
And do other things together. 
P: 
I hope so. 
I: 
Yeah. Okay. I’m gonna clear out and let K do his thing. 
P: 
Uh-oh. 
I: 
And don’t worry, he takes beautiful photographs. Beautiful. 
P: 
[Whispering] so, you’ll make be a size 2? 
I2: 
Oh, wait, you’re not looking forward to this part, huh? 
P: 
No. 
I2: 
Okay. No problem 
P:

I2: 
This will be so painless.
