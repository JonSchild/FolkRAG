00:00:15 Nubia introduces herself to Lizette and they clarify they both work with 
Worker’s Justice Project. Nubia then asks Lizet to describe her present day 
laborer work. 
 
00:00:47 N describes the day labor daily routine, going to corner in Williamsburg, in the 
borough of Brooklyn, New York City (she lives in Queens, a neighboring 
borough in New York City).  N clarifies that she came to the U.S. from 
Colombia. 
 
00:01:25   Comments briefly on how she started domestic work two years ago, how 
many bosses she has had, and how they treat her. 
 
00:02:09   Provides more details about waiting at the stop to be picked up in the 
mornings as a day laborer, weather conditions, and what a good day or a bad 
day consists of (hours can vary, pay cannot be what they are told it is). 
 
00:03:56   N describes how many women are at the day labor stop, how they relate to 
each other and what skills are needed to be a domestic worker, what’s 
necessary to do the job well, how the women get “picked” at the stop. 
Mentions that she has other specialty skills (archiving) but without 
documentation and ability to speak English perfectly, she does day labor 
instead. 
 
00:06:40 When asked about ways of getting a child to eat or remedies she uses, N 
answers based on her experience as a mother, as she is not a babysitter. 
 
00:08:01 Describes one good aspect of job—when she is paid as promised.  How it goes 
when she is not paid as promised. Clarifies again that she does housecleaning, 
not babysitting.  Has two children of her own.  Describes forms of 
discrimination and disrespect on the job, reasons for mistrust of employers, 
risks, indecent proposals, lack of bathroom access, reasons for fear on the job.

elaborate. 
 
00:13:41  Describes daily schedule and how she goes back home to be with her children 
if work does not pan out. 
 
00:14:03  N clarifies she is a member of the Worker’s Justice Project, but is not part of 
the “domestic” workers community as she works hourly or daily not as a live-
in helper.  Describes how she got involved with Worker’s Justice program— 
women came to offer workshops and she learned a lot. 
 
00:16:08 In regard to Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights, Nubia again affirms that 
domestic workers are different than day laborers.  On their stop “we don’t 
have any rights” because it is just for a few hours. 
 
00:16:47 N describes rights she would like in the future, related to the DW Bill of 
Rights.  She would like all the women at the stop to have support, a good 
salary, the ability to ask a lot of questions.  Workers’ Justice program is 
important because she learns through the workshops and meetings they offer. 
 
00:17:39 Describes what she would like politicians to know about domestic workers. She 
would like colleagues to learn more about their rights with employers. N 
describes what she learned she could require of her employers—mop, fixed 
salary, leadership, how to use organic products, and more. 
 
19:41     Nubia’s final thoughts, exhorting other women to get organized.  Interviewers 
take a break and decide to redo some earlier questions. 
 
22:06  
 Describes the experience of waiting at the day laborer stop with some 
additional details. 
 
24:29  
 Finishes by stating her responsibilities in this work (meet employer 
expectations, look up the address they are going to, take care of each other).
