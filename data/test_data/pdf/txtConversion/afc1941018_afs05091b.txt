Alice Gaston: We was talking about in the old war time, the old slavery time. I can remember when,
uh, I can remember when the Yankees come through and, uh, they carried my father away and
carried away, my si, two sisters and one brother. And, uh, they left me. And I can remember when
my missus used to run in the garden, from the Yankees and tell us if they come, don't tell them
where they at. Told, don't tell nobody where they at when they come and they all come and they told
me, don't get scared now and tell them, where they is, where they is. I told them no, we told them
no. And uh, when they come and ask for them I told them I didn't know there they was, and they was
in the woods. And this was at the house. And my father, when my father left, he carried with the,
he went away with the Yankees, and carried two, carried two, two girls and one son, the oldest one.
Carried them with him. And he with the Yankees. And I can remember that. And uh, my old missus

government they treat me nice. I was in a old house down there, took me out the old house and put
me up there in a good house where they could take care of me. And I'm in there yet. I don't find no
fault. Give me enough food to eat, give me clothes to wear. They been treating me just as nice as
they can. I can't find no fault.
