Step It Down
 
Games,  Plays,  Songs,  and Stories from the Afro-American Heritage
 
Bessie Jones and Bess Lomax Hawes
 
A Brown Thrasher Book
 
Growing up in the rural South,  black folk musician Bessie Jones
 
sang her way through long hours of field work and child tending,
 
entertaining her young companions with chants and riddles or joining
 
them for a rousing evening of ring dances and singing plays.
 Her
 
memories of these childhood activities, recorded in Step It Down
  
by folklorist Bess Lomax Hawes,  capture the shape and color of the
 
crowded,  impoverished,  life-demanding and life-loving days of the
 
black family of sixty years ago, revealing the strength and vitality
 
of African and slave traditions in black American life.
 
The power of music and motion to transform a world of scarcity
 
and hardship into one cf laughter and  j
oy echoes t rou  nut Bessir  J
nn
 
words:
 
"And the other childrens and I would go in the bottom and have
 
a frolic,  instead of going to bed.
 I was  j
ust; up for that singing,
 
and  I remember they used to say.  .
 .
 "Come on, Lizzie!" and we'd
 
go down a way and we'd have a dance.
 
Oh it was pretty.  .
 .
 .
 You know,  i
t; was  j
ust a
d
; good as the
 
blues- -d
 nor,  hotter in
 ay.
 When
 ;
id folks wou.
 go to
 
work or go off or somethi;g,,  we'd put on them long dresses and,
 
boy, we'd have a time."
 
(Jones & Hawes/catalog copy) 2
 
Step It Down weaves together the lyrics, music,  and description
 
of traditional Afro-American children's songs as well as Jones'
 
comments on their meaning and "feel."  Whether reciting "Tom, Tor
n,
 
Greedy Gut," or demonstrating the more complex steps of "Ranky Tank"
 
and "Buzzard's Lope," Bessie Jones always viewed the amusements of the
 
young as preparation for adult roles and relationships.
 Grounded in the
 
values of the black community, her songs taught children about cooperative
 
interaction and mutual concern, not competition and individual achievement,
 
showing them how to create fun out of nothing more than their hands,
 
feet,  voices,  and imaginations.
 
Bessie Jones was one of the foremost folk artists in the United States
 
whose performances, recordings,  and educational programs earned her
 
several noted awards including a National Heritage Fellowship from
 
the National Endowment for the Arts.
 She died in 1984 at age 83.
 
Bess Lomax Hawes is director of the Folk Arts Program for the National
 
Endowment for the Arts and the author, with John Stewart,  of For the
 
Ancestors.

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
A
thcii. (
or

 o 6 o2.
 
It has been a long time since I was last in touch with you about your
 
book Step It Down. 
I just wanted to drop you a note to let you know
 
that I saw blues--where we can see what the book will look like when
 
it's printed, but before it is actually printed--today.
 If all goes
 
well, we should have books in about two months.
 
I hope that you are doing well these days and enjoying the summer.
 
Best wishes,

Life  on  the  Georgia  Sea  Islands  was
 
It
 was
 the
 singingest
 community
 around,
 md
 
scholars  came  from  many  corners  of  the  world  to
 
observe and record the games,  play and songs that
 
had
 been
 traditional
 for
 generations.
 All
 
musical
 activity
 occurs
 with
 just
 voice
 and
 
clapping.
 No  instruments  are  used.
 Many  of  the
 
songs
 originated
 in
 Africa,
 as
 did
 their
 
ancestors.
 Some  are  also  found  today  in  the
 
Caribbean,  New Orleans and other places.
 
There  are  "baby  games  and  plays",  clapping
 
plays,  singing  plays,  ring  plays,  dances,  house
 
plays,  outdoor games,  songs and stories.
 "Plays"
 
are  improvised  acting  out of  an  idea  with  dialog
 
and  action.
 "Games"  refer  to  sequences  of  an
 
action  with  a  given  result.
 Both  are  always
 
performed  by  a  group,  never  alone.
 The  whole
 
idea was  to create  fun  out  of  nothing.
 About  75
 
games,  plays  and  all  activity  are  described  as
 
the Sea  Islanders knew them.
 The  1972 clothbound
 
edition  was
 the
 compilation  of
 Bessie  Jones'
 
repertoire.
 She died  in  1984  and  Bess  Hawes,  of
 
the National  Endowment  for  the  Arts  has  made  all
 
necessary  revisions  and  additions  for  this  new
 
Laperhack edition,  which  is I

Thank you for y
our recent response concerning my
 
current project with Charles Doyle.  We had presumed
 
that the publisher would keep y
ou abreast of reviews
 
of Step It Down, and consequently we chose not to send
 
a copy with our first letter.  Anyway, here's a copy
 
of the review as it appeared in Atlanta History. I
 
enjoyed reading the book.
 
Sincerely,
