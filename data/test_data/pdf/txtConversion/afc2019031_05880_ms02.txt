Lisa has worked in preservation since 1972, beginning as a Museum Technician at the

1979-1984 she was employed as a Historical Architect on the Northeast Team of the Denver 
Service Center, the centralized planning and design office of the National Park Service. In 1984, 
she became the first woman to enter the National Park Service preservation trades training 
program at the Williamsport Preservation Training Center in Williamsport, Maryland (now the 
NPS Historic Preservation Training Center). After completing the program, she remained on the 
Training Center staff as a Supervisory Preservation Specialist and Senior Historical Architect. In 
1993, she became the Assistant Chief Historical Architect for the National Park Service in 
Washington, D.C. She worked in the Northeast Region of the National Park Service as a Project 
Manager and Facility Management Coordinator from 1996 until her retirement from the National

Learning Development and Vanishing Treasures Programs, and as an instructor for more than 
25 “Guiding Principles for Field-Based Historic Preservation” workshops in locations around the 
country. 
 
Project work has included; planning and project supervision for stabilization of hospital 
structures on the south side of Ellis Island, project management for the rehabilitation of the entry 
level of the Washington Monument, and work on dozens of 18th-20th century structures in 
National Parks in the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. She has also worked with the Forest 
Service in the Pacific Northwest to preserve CCC-era rustic log structures, and encourage the 
development of in-house preservation teams. Since 1987, she has helped to develop training 
programs, and instructed workshops in preservation philosophy and "hands on" preservation 
methods for federal agencies, universities, and state and local groups. In 2001, Lisa received 
the Askins Achievement Award, presented annually by the Preservation Trades Network for 
significant contributions to the preservation trades. She also received the Crystal Owl Award for
