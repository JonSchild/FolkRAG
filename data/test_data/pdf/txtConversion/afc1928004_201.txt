Sang by MILES MORRIS. 
I 
WISH to introduce myself, and tell from where I 
came, 
I 
drive a 
Dublin Jaunting Car, and Daniel is my name; 
I'm always ready for a 
job, to drive you near or far, 
So try the value of my words by jumping on my car. 
For Daniel always is on hand that place beyond just on the stand, 
To hovel, hut or palace grand, I'll drive you near or far. 
To place or park, to Murty Moore's or Noah's ark, 
In light or dark, I'll drive you near or far. 
CHORUS. 
Then if you want to take a 
ride 
I'll quickly have my horse 'long side, 
To Phenix Park or Liffy's tide, I'll drive you on my car. 
Then whip, crack and off we go. 
Never slow as you know, 
A 
shilling's all I 
ax you, so, sir, jump upon my car, 
If your honor is a 
stranger here and want to know the town, 
I 
will describe all as we ride, the streets, sir, up and down. 
First thing we'll cross the Carlisle bridge, up famous Sackville 
street, 
As far as Nelson's monument, so handsome and complete, 
To Dublin castle next we'll go, the Lord Leftenant's house I'll 
show, 
Four courts and Patrick's church, also, so jump upon my car. 
If you're in for fun, to Nancy Hand's we'll take a 
run, 
Good lunch and punch, and party girls are there. 
Then if, &c. 
The Prince of Wales to Dublin he once came to see the town, 
Each Jarvey was afraid but me to drive his highness 'round, 
When lie sat on the sate, sez I 
just keep your holt astore, 
And the divil such a 
ride he said, he ever had before. 
Now every word I 
tell to you is very true, if doubt you do, 
Just ax the Prince himself, yes, do, then jump upon my car, 
Then off we boult, don't mind the ,goults, 
Keep up your bolts. Whip up the coult. In " luxury we joult/

HOW PADDY'S REPRESENTED , 
Sung everywhere with immense success by M ILES M ORRIS, Irish Corn-
median, Comic and Character Vocalist. 
I'VE just arrived from Dublin to-night, and feel quite discon-
tented, 
To see the way we are run down, not fairly represented, 
It seems to be a 
general rule to make poor Pat a 
rogue and fool: 
But never mind, I'll take it cool, and stick up for Old Ireland. 
CHORUS. 
So do me justice, treat me fair, I'll not be discontented, 
Nor yet be snubbed everywhere, when fairly represented. 
They say I've dirty and lazy got, but at that I'll never grumble, 
Just go and visit an Irish cot, you're welcome though it's humble, 
In public works through the country round, in railway tunnels 
or underground, 
Or where hard work is to be found, you'll find the boys from 
Ireland. 
So do me, kc. 
Now there in his literature, the cause it grieves me sadly, 
Whenever he draws our caricature, he pictures us rather badly„ 
With crooked legs, and villainous face, lie represents the Irish 
race, 
I'm sure it is a 
sad disgrace, we think so in Ould Ireland. 
So do me, &c. 
Sure it is very well known, that an Irishman is gay and frisky. 
own that I'm fond of a 
pretty girl, and I 
like a 
drop of whis-
key, 
I'll do what I 
like with what's me own, I'm very quiet if let 
alone, 
But we hate the foes, Och-hone, who dare run down old Ire-
land. 
So do me, Ake. 
THE TAIL OF MY COAT. 
As sung with thunders of applause everywhere by MILES MORRIS, tis

LELIINED my reading and writing at Ballynaggert, 
when I 
went to school, 
It was there I 
first took to fightin' wid the schoolmaster, 
Mr. O'Toole, 
He and I 
we had many a 
scrimmage, but the divel a ,-opy 
I 
wrote, 
For there wasn't a 
gossoon in the village could stand on the 
tail of my coat. 
CHORUS. 
Dare stand on the tail of my coat, ah, just tread on the tail 
of my coat, 
If your in for a 
row or a 
ruction, just stand on the tail of 
my coat. 
I

But the (Evil a

Dare stand, & c. 
But a 
big trotter, Mickey Malony, tried for to steal her 
away, 
lie had money and I 
hadn't any, so a 
challenge I 
sent hint 
next day, 
Next morning we met at Killalley, and the Shannon IN e 
crossed in a 
boat, 
Oh I 
lathered him with my shillalah, for ho stood on t_  
tail of my coat. 
Dare stand, &,..;

Now my fame is spread over the countla

gaze upon me, 
They all cried out without hesitation your a 
fighting man, 
Mickey Magee, 
I 
fought with the Finigan faction, and I 
hate all the Mur, 
phys afloat, 
So if your in for a 
belly-go-
fisther, just stand on the tail of 
my coat. 
Dare stand, <3.7c. 
I've traveled through Ulster and Munster, Kilkenny, and 
Connaught likewise, 
It was there when I 
first was a 
youngster, I 
opened this 
pair of brown eyes; 
it's there you'll see fire without smoke ; for a 
shilling 
you'll buy 50 eggs, 
And the girls they can all take a 
joke there, and there is 
monkeys without any legs.

THE ROVING IRISH BOY. 
As sung at Tony Pastor's Opera House, New York, by MILE! Mon= 
I'M a 
roving Irish boy, I 
was born in Augh-na-cloy, 
With the turn of the wrist me stick I 
twist, I 
am me 
mother's joy; 
I've travled many a 
mile for to gain a 
colleen's smile, 
With the love of me heart for them I'd part, and many; an 
hour beguile, 
But I've just dropt in top tell ye's all the places I 
have 
been, 
And all the very funny sights in me travels I 
have seen. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm a 
roving Irish boy that was born in Augh-na-cloy, 
With the turn of the wrist me stick I 
twist, I 
am me 
mother's j 
oy. 
I've been in la belle France, where the girls know how to 
dance; 
When I 
left the bogs I 
couldn't eat frogs, though I 
often 
had the chance, 
And in Germany I've been, now you musn't think me 
green, 
And pretzels strong and sausages long, a 
yard or more I've 
seen, 
And into Russia then I 
entered the land of furs a..d capes, 
Where the men they make the women work, an. *le col-
diers they look like apes. 
For I'm a 
roving, &e. 
11 
tr. 
To China then I 
went, where I 
got my heart's content, 
Of the briny sea and dirty tea, enough to make you squint, 
Japan came next in view, be my sowl I 
say that too, 
But the yellow jacks ne'er broke my back, that's why I 
look so blue, 
Prt sailing under stars and stripes I've reached Columbia's 
shore, 
And now I 
like this plan so well I'll never leave it more. 
CHORUS. 
Except the cry will be— come Paddy, and go with me, 
And brave once more the Atlantic's war, and set old Ire-
land free. 
THE WICKLOW GIRL. 
THE Lord bless you all, I've just come out to have a 
little chat, 
I'm Irish sure, but that's no sin, I'm a 
rollicking, merry Pat 
The ladies' hearts I 
captivate as for them my stick I 
twirl. 
But gramachree the maid for me is Kitty, the Wicklow Girl. 
CHORUS. 
For her neck is white and her step is light, and her teeth are 
like the pearl, 
There is none so gay by night or day, as Kitty, the Wicklow Girl, 
Her fortune, faith, it is but small, to him who wins her hand, 
But her heart is pure. and that's worth all the diamonds in the 
land; 
If my pockets they were lined with gold, like any great lord of 
earl, 
Arrah, Boys, I'm sure I'd still be poor without my Wicklow Ci.f. 
For her neck, & c. 
Yes may talk about fandangos that the ladies hop in France 
But let them go to Wicklow, and there they see a 
rule () aid 
Irish dance, 
Both rich and poor they nittle the floor, as their kippens the., do 
twirl, 
Arah, me grows big, when I 
dance a 
jig with Kitty, my 
low girl. 
For her neck, & c.

Farewell to my father, although he was blind, 
Shall I 
ever forget him while my heart beats with joy, 
For he called me his own son, the wild Irish boy, 
Yes, he called me his own son, the wild Irish boy. 
When I 
came to this country I 
had brogans on my feet, 
And corduroy breeches, although they were neat, 
Sure the boys all laughed at me, but it gave me great joy, 
For they called me their hero, the wild Irish boy, 
Yes, they called me their hero, the wild Irish boy. 
I 
will send for my parents, and they will come here. 
To a 
land filled with plenty and a

know they will bless me and it will give me great joy, 
For they will call me their darling, their wild Irish boy. 
Yes, they will call me their darling, their wild Irish boy-

For to gaze once more on it, though a

Sung with great applanse at the Globe Theatre, Broadway. New York. 
I.y Miles Morris, the celebrated Irish Comedian and Vocalist. 
FM an Irishman, me name is Dan, I 
was born in Ballinderry 
On a 
bright May day in '43, on the other side of Kerry; 
_My mother kept a 
little pig, and me she kept to mind it, 
But like every other little pig, share it carried its tail behind it. 
CHORUS. 
SO 
I 
love to roam, and left my home, and traveled to a 
far off 
land, 
Bufaltho' I 
cross the ocean, I 
don't forget devotion to poor old 
Ireland. 
Now I 
left behind in Ireland a 
girl I 
love so dearly, 
She was nursery maid in a 
great big house, they paid her ten 
pounds yearly, 
Her eyes were like the little stars that shine in heaven so 
brightly, 
And like a 
pair of mountain goats, we dance about so sprightly. 
So I 
love to, &c. 
Now my colLeen's name was Mary Jane, her age was two and 
twenty, 
I 
had no money on her to spend, although I've spirit plenty, 
The times were bad my heart grew sad, it was hard to get a 
living, 
And if employers gave me work, poor wages they were giving. 
So I 
love to, &c. 
So to Americky I 
made my way, and friends I 
found warm-
hearted, 
But I 
can't forget old Ireland yet, and from those from whom! 
parted; 
I 
like the boys and I 
like the girls, and I 
like the American 
manners, 
And shure if they want an Irishman, I'll fight beneath their 
banner.

WEDDING OF BIDDY M'GRANE. 
As sung by M ILES M ORRIS. 
LL sing you a 
song if you'll listen awhile, 
Of a 
damsel so pretty, so charming, and witty, 
Tho liv'd from the City of Dublin a 
mile, 
On the road to Clondalk, in the Emerald Isle; 
think for a 
moment I'm tipping the blarney, 
But search near and far and you might search in vain, 
"From Donaghadee, to the banks of Killarney, 
And not find the equal of Biddy M'Grane. 
A 
tine hearted genuine son of the soil, 
One Larry Molloy, a 
broth of a 
boy, 
Who knew what it was for his living to toil, 
On a 
neat bit of land of his own at Bahloyle; 
And Larry for marriage felt no inclination, 
But love is a 
thing that ye cannot explain, 
And enters your heart without hesitation, 
So Larry was smitten with Biddy M'Grane. 
Now Larry was fond of a 
jig the spalpeen. 
He went to the fair and Biddy was there, 
_And strolling up to the pretty Colleen, 
Soon led her out for a 
dance on the green; 
''he blink of her eye was near driving him crazy, 
He axed her consent but she look'd with disdain, 
Tut when the bold Larry, he trampled the daisy, 
It melted the heart of Biddy M'Grane. 
day of the wedding the girls and the boys, 
And friends were invited, and highly delighted, 
The Lannigans, the Brannans, the Burkes, and Molloys, 
Were all in there glory, with fun and with noise; 
Miss Morgan she came along with Dan Brady, 
In a 
new suit 
bought from old Petticoat Lane, 
And larry M'Guiness arrived with Miss Grady, 
To dance at the wedding of Biddy M'Grane. 
The feasting indeed it was mighty fine, 
There•was bacon and cheese, potatoes and peas, 
And lashings of Petheen, in place of the wine, 
Biddy she look'd like a 
goddess divine; 
Attired as she was in her gorgeous apparel, 
In a 
new yellow kirtle of Muslin de laine, 
Ould Barney the fiddler on top of a 
barrel, 
Struck up " Garryowen" for Biddy M'Grane. 
The feasting concluded the dancing began, 
The Cairns and the Gilligans, and the O'Howlagans, 
All of them leaped to there feet, to a 
man, 
And jigged it as only Irishman can; 
But when bould Jemmy Howlagan leaped on the table, 
I 
suppose ' twas the whiskey that fired his brain 
And roared " Cead mule Faltaigh" long as he was able, 
Good luck and more power to Biddy M'Grane.

Yet it wakens the pity iv every one, 
It's in vain ye'll be thryin to prevint yeersels cryin, 
An' yeer eyes ye'll be dhryin when me song it is done. 
'Twas in sweet Tipperary there stud a

Poor ould Ned loved his daughter for an angel he thought

An' fine clause he brought her to make her look gay, 
And she was the sweet creathure so full o' good nathure,, 
An' as fair in ach fathure iz the blossom o' Mary, 
She was naways intrudhin an' niver a

So ye'll all be kincludin she'd iv lovers her share. 
There was thradesmin an' docthors an' lawyers an' procthors

Just to get a

The pride iv her dad and his dairy, 
Och! she was his delight an' the pearl' iv his sight, 
An as frishkey au' blithe as fairy, 
But so plase you, sweet Mary loy'd one Paddy Rarey 
Who could dance like a 
fairy an twer'll a 
shtick; 
Tho' his birth was a 
misthry could thrace his ancisthry 
Thro' the pages iv histhry to " Amonachnic;"

But Mary's ould didn't care for young Paddy 
For naw money had he sure a 
wife to suppoort, 
An' a 
silky ould waver, a

Crept in to lied's favor his daughter to coort,

An' was promised the hand iv sweet Mary, 
The pride iv her dad and his dairy, 
Och! she was his delight an' the pearl' iv his sight, 
An' as frishkey an' blithe as a

Mary's lovers got jealous and oft they did bellus, 
Say'n " before they expel' us we'll all take the sack,'° 
One w.nt home to his garden an' ( cravin yer pardon) 
He (lug up the devil and shoveled him back, 
An' some shouldhered arums an' others sung psarums, 
Ani many thried charums till their houses they burrn'd, 
And .he papers related iv " deaths contemplated"

By the beautiful heart killin Mary, 
The pride iv her dad an' his dairy, 
Och ? she was his delight an' pearl' iv his sight, 
An as frishkey an' blithe as a

So one day to her father, sez Mary, I'd rather 
Be single for life, than that life shad be ruled 
By a 
crawlin ould weaver, and I'd not have the craver 
If the hair of his head hoong wid diamonds and gold." 
Sez her father, " Daunt raise me, for the divil may sa.ize me, 
If yer ever have Pat I'd as lave see yer dead," 
The he turrn'd like a

Till she fell on the tiled flare her senses all fled,

And you wouldn't give that (snaps the finger) for poor Mary, 
The pride iv her dad an' his dairy,

But at last she got betthur and wraut Pat a

Telling him to forget her, an' bid him good bye ! 
Then she gave a 
great shiver, flue away to the river, 
Axed ITeav'n to forgive her and prepared for to die! 
"Come away from the wather," shouted Ned, "my dear daughter 
And you shall wed Pat an' have all yer dad's tin," 
But it wasn't so aisy, for the spot bein' grazy, 
An' her bent' crazy, she slipped an' fell in,

An' all down to the bottom went Mary, 
In sight of her dad an' his dairy,

An' sure ould Ned Carey follied Paddy and Mary, 
An' they haunted the dairy an' kicked up a

An' such shriekin an' laughter, from foundation to rafther, 
Was heard for years afther till the house it fell in

Her Paddy, her dad, and the dairy, 
An' from that same night I've never seen sight 
Iv the home iv the beautiful fairy.

THE ISLAND OF GREEN. 
Sung by M ILES M ORRIS, With ERIN and the BRENNANS. 
" 
AH poh ! botheration, dear Irelands the nation, 
Where man ev'ry joy upon earth may obtain, 
Where with hospitality, conviviality. 
Friendship and open sincerity reign ;" 
" 
Sure I've roam'd the world over from Dublin to Dove; 
But in all the strange countries wherever I've been; 
I 
ne'er saw an island on sea or on dryland, 
Like Paddy's own sweet little Island of green." 
The sweet little island, the dear little Island, 
Like Paddy's own sweet little island of green. 
In England your roses make mighty fine posies, 
Provoke Scotia's thistle you meet your reward, 
But shure for its beauty an Irishman's duty, 
Will teach him his own native plant to regard, 
St. Patrick he set it, with dewdrops he wet it, 
And often to cherish and bless it was seen, 
Its verdures are rare too, it's fresh and its fair too, 
And blooms but in Ireland's own Island of green. 
The sweet little Island, the dear little Island, 
Like Paddy's own sweet little Island of green. 
A 
sprig from each stem, forms a 
rich varied gem, 
More brilliantly bright than the dew on the thorn, 
Together unblighted unsullied united, 
It blooms a 
bouquet beauty's breast to adorn, 
Oh ! long may they flourish, may heaven's dews nourish, 
Each warm kindred soil where the emblems are seen, 
May no fatal blunder, e'er tear them asunder, 
But long be they wreath'd in the Island of green. 
The sweet little Island, the dear little Island, 
Like Paddy's own sweet little Island of green 
Success to old Ireland, its bog and its mireland. 
There's not such a 
universe under the sun, 
For honor, for spirit, fidelity, merit, 
For wit and good fellowship, frolic and fun, 
With wine and with whiskey when he once gets frisky, 
An Irishman's heart. in true colors is seen, 
While with mirth overflowing, with love it is glowing, 
With love for its own native Island of green. 
The sweet little Island, the dear little Island, 
Like Paddy's own sweet little Island of green. 
NEVER LOOK BEHIND. 
Sang by MILES MORRIS. 
HOW many folks ropine at fate, 
Awl bpw their heads to sorrow, 
I 
laugh when cares upon me wait, 
I 
know they'll leave to-morrow; 
Anti easily through life I 
glide, 
'Tis always the best I 
find 
To carry my troubles eheet fully, 
And never look behial. 
Cnonus. 
For what's the use of looking back, 
Or giving way to sorrow, 
The skies to-day that look so black, 
May brighter be to- morrow; 
'Tis easy to drive dull care away, 
if you've the strength of mind, 
To carry your troubles cheerfully, 
And never look behind. 
In journeying along the road of life, 
You'll meet with many a 
man, 
Who'll throw a 
pound away, 
Because he's lost a 
penny, 
And wander from the beaten track, 
As if he felt inclin'd, 
To look for sonic new trouble, 
Which he might have left behind. 
For what's the use, (ke. 
Others too will try and make, 
A 
fortune in a 
hurry, 
And if they don't succeed at once, 
Will fret, and fume, and worry, 
" 
What can't be cured must be endured," 
Is a 
maxim old and true, 
"Don't care for care" then rest assued, 
That care won't care for you. 
For what's the use, &e. 
In lifwat times we must expect, 
To meet with " things unpleasant," 
We can't recall the time that's past, 
But may improve the present, 
Deal fairly with your fellow man, 
To every one be kind, 
And hope for bright and better days, 
But never look behind.

An Address to an Old Wooden Pipet, 
Sung by M ILES M ORRIS. 
SO they say you'r a 
villain old friend, 
That you rob me of sleep and of sense, 
To ruin my strength that you tend, 
And walk off with my hardly earn'd pence. 
That you lead to late hours and bad ways, 
And encourage a 
taste for strong drink, 
One friend in particular says, 
Without hesitation you stink 
That you are not a 
beauty I 
fear, 
An old blackened tube at the best; 
Your odor—decidedly queer, 
And you'r seldom if ever at rest. 
I 
do take a 
glass when I 
smoke, 
Especially after I've dined; 
And my friends are most welcome to croak 
If it any-way eases their mind. 
I 
think I 
with safety may state 
That you have cost me fourpence a 
day; 
That I 
sometime; have sat up too late 
And smoked yon whilst losing at play, 
Still those fourpence I 
well can afford, 
They make no great hole in my purse; 
And I 
really don't think, on my word, 
That the smoke made play any worse.

TERRIBLE TIMES, 
Of ondthing I'm perfectly sure, 
If my temper should follow my pelf, I 
My friends from bad words are secure./ 
For I 
take it all out on yourself. 
I 
gnaw at your dirty old stem, 
And I 
shut myself in with a 
cloud, 
And until I've recovered my phlegm 
I 
do not emerge from my shroud., 
You help me bear sorrow and pain, 
You smooth the rough journey of life 
You stand by me in sunshine and rain 
And you keep mc from anger and strife. 
The longest song must have an end, 
Mine has with this simple recipe; 
If you want to keep terms with a 
friend 
Don't endeavor to put out his pipe. 
Sung by MILES Monnts, 
OH these are the Terrible Times, 
If one's single why so you must tarry, 
For except a 
few fools that are mad, 
There's no one would venture to marry, 
For bacon is nine pence. a 
pound, 
And sorrow much cheaper the meat is, 
And tho' there's but few of them sound, 
Nine pence haphly we pay for Potatoes, 
Oh these are the Terrible Times. 
Sure now if a 
neighbor drops in, 
He walks with such funeral paces, 
You'd think he could stand on his head, 
He pulls on such awful long faces, 
If a 
country friend comes up to town, 
He's not asked for the wife or the babies, 
But before he has time to sit down, 
He must tell all about the Potatoes, 
And tell of the Terrible Times. 
The American bacon they say, 
Tho' the prices they now and then vary, 
Sure the best of it comes all the way, 
From that darlin' ould town Tipperary, 
If you take a 
walk down the main street, 
Its there that the wonderful trade is, 
Fine Cumberland cuts you will get, 
And most beautiful flowery Potatoes, 
Notwithstanding the Terrible Times. 
The " Reform Bill" is now all the go, 
Tho' Ould Ireland's left out of the measure, 
There's faults sure we all of us know, 
That Ben Dizzy will see at his leisure; 
24 
If John Bright would again cross the sea, 
To see what our Borough home rate ja, 
We'd treat him to lashins of tea, 
And most beautiful flowery potatoes; 
And tell him the Terrible Times. 
And sure when the Finnigins riz, 
The ructions was terribly awful; 
But the Peeler then showed them that roms, 
Was unpleasant as well as unlawful; 
But what they were fighting about, 
Sure no one was able to state to us; 
But if" Tenant Right" wasn't the cause, 
Perhaps ' twas about the Potatoes; 
Or may be the Terrible Times. 
And if any young Lady was here, 
Who would like for to change her condition 
I'm the Chap that would talk to her ear, 
And whisper my humble petition; 
I'd say I 
was comin' to woo, 
And move her by all my entreaties; 
But what else sure is nothing to you, 
But it would'nt be about the Potatoes ; 
Nor yet of the Terrible Times. 
And now that the Winter is gone, 
'Tis worse that the times they are gettin; 
But as Solomon said to his son, 
Or the devil a 
use there's in frettin ; 
I'm tould that them Holloways pills, 
Cured a 
shockiu bad leg of Tim Brady's; 
And as they cure all sorts of ills, 
Perhaps they might cure the Potatoes; 
And get rid of the Terrible Times. 
AN IRISHMAN'S WANT. 
As sung by M ILES MORRIS. 
ALL the way from Paddy's land. 
I've jist travell'd down, Sirs, 
To see the English quality 
It was I 
came to town, Sirs. 
To see the Queen I 
meant, 
Likewise the sweet princesses, 
All smother'd up with gold 
And jewels and fine dresses. 
CHORUS. 
7or sure the loyal folk 
Poor Paddy wants to know, Sirs; 
To Erin's verdant Isle, 
He wishes they would go, Sirs. 
When I 
was on the Packet, faith, 
I 
wish'd I 
was on shore; 
For sure the ugly blackguards 
Had'nt fastened down the floor. 
But I 
came safe at last, 
And went out for an airing; 
But not a 
soul I 
saw 
Though I 
hurt my eyes with staring. 
For sure, &c. 
At last I 
met a Peeler 
By himself a 
struttin', 
With his ugly mouth brim full 
Of impudence and mutton. 
25 
Says I, " My noble blue 
Where is all the people gone to? 
But he only shouted out 
"Now Irishman! move on do !" 
For sure, &c. 
When I 
tipped him half a 
pint, 
He began to grin, sir, 
And told me that all the world 
Had travelled down to Windsor; 
To see a 
Princess wed 
To a 
noble Scottish Peer. 
Says I, " Such news, bedad, 
" 
Aint worth half a 
pint of beer? 
For sure, &c. 
"Now if you'd only told me 
"That an Irishman she'd wed, 
"At my expense my hearty 
"You might drink till you were dead. 
" 
I 
have no fear," says Bobby 
" 
That I 
still shall get my bread, 
"For to marry Paddy 
" 
There's one remaining yet."

sure, &c. 
PAT AND THE WIDOW. 
IRISH SONG. 
As sung by MILES Monrus. 
IN BallInaha, wanst there dwelt a 
fair widdy, 
Renown'd thro' the country for beauty and wit, 
Tho' coorted by many she cared not for any, 
For.Pat wid a 
love-shaft her bosom had hit. 
Oh the glance of her eye sure it bother'd the county, 
'Twas bright as the dew on the fresh morning grass, 
And her smile so inviting, set all the boys lighting, 
And kindled the envy of ninny a 
lass, 
And her smile so inviting set all the boys fighting, 
And kindled the envy of many a 
lass. 
But rat was unhappily given to dhrinking, 
And widow O'Grady objected to this, 
For Pat when in whisky was apt to get frisky, 
And folks said he often made off wid a 
kiss. 
Be that as it may, sure the widow spoke plainly, 
And tould him this drinking he'd have to give o'er, 
For she never -would marry him while she had to carry him, 
Drunk and insensible home to his door, 
No, she would never marry him while she had to carry him, 
Drunk and insensible home to his door. 
So what did he do but he made her a 
promise. 
On Irish ground never to taste spirits more, 
But a 
week after that, and the widow saw Pat, 
And he drunk in a 
boat and asleep on his oar, 
Arrah Pat, is it thus your promise you're kaping, 
On Irish ground never again to get drunk, 
Och don't be abusing me, sure, ain't I 
slaping, 
And can't you parsaive ' tis on water I'm dhrunk, 
Now don't be abusing me, don't be accusing me, 
Can't ye parsaive ' Gs on water I'm dhrunk. 
Then he swore a 
big oath that on land or on water, 
No spirituous liquor again would he taste, 
The widow was pacified and the pace ratified, 
And the fond couple made one by the praist, 
Well your sowl sich a 
habit had grown on the fellow, 
He couldn't abstain from a 
dhrop de ye see, 
And though she had bound him by oath, soon she found him, 
As dhrunk as a 
lord, and he up in a 
tree ; 
And though she had bound him by oath; soon she found him 
As dhrunk as a 
lord, and he up in a 
tree,

599 Broadway, New York. 
WON'T you tell me, Mollie darling, 
That you love none else but me? 
For I 
love you, Mollie darling, 
You are all the world to me. 
Oh! tell me, darling, that you love me, 
Put your little hand in mine, 
Take my heart, sweet Mollie darling, 
Say that you will give me thine. 
CifoRus. 
Mollie, fairest, sweetest, dearest, 
Look up, darling, tell me this: 
Do you love me, Mollie darling? 
Let your answer be a 
kiss. 
Stars are smiling, Mollie darling, 
Through the mystic vail of night; 
They seem laughing, Mollie darling, 
While fair Luna hides her light; 
Oh ! no one listens but the flowers, 
While they hang their heads in shame, 
They are modest, Mollie darling, 
When they hear me call your name. 
Mollie, fairest, &c. 
I 
must leave you, Mollie darling, 
Though the parting gives me pain; 
When the stars shine, Mollie darling, 
I 
will meet you here again. 
Oh! good- night, Mollie, good-bye, loved one 
Happy may you ever be, 
When you're dreaming, Mollie darling, 
Don't forget to dream of me. 
Mollie, fairest,

PAT WON'T GO HOME TILL MORNING, 
Composed and sung by J. H. itTAN, now performing with Merchant's 
Panorama of Ireland, ai " Rory the Rover.' 
THE dawn upon the hill was breakin7, the stars were twinkling 
in the slcy, 
As Pat upon the ground lay dreaming, his big shillelah lay close 
by, 
All night the whiskey he's been drinking, and now he wakens 
from his drunken snore, 
He calls for drink to make him frisky, and swears because there 
is no more. 
CITORTJS. 
Then fill up the bowl, hurrah ! for a 
thirsty soul, ha! ha! 
An night on,a spree, my boys, my throat with fire is burning, 
Dance so blithe and gay,hurrah ! none like Pat can be, ha! hal. 
Divil a 
hair I 
care, my boys, we won't go home till morning. 
The moon upon the bogs was gleaming, and the lambs were 
bleating in the shed, 
The pigs and sows the swill are raking, and the gossons waiting 
to be fed, 
Pat home from the wake is trudging slowly, with divil a 
farth-
ing in his purse, 
Besides his pockets are both holey, and credit to poor Pat not's 
worth a 
curse. 
Then fill up, tte. 
The night and fun again advances, and the song and dance 
again goes ' round, 
And Pat again is nimbly drinking, until with whiskey he gets 
drowned, 
All night he's been swigging at the bottle, and now he tumbles 
flat upon the floor. 
Yet still the boys and girls are dancing, but Pat's asleep tc, 
dance no more. 
Then fill up, !co.

THE- CHARCOAL MAN. 
Oomposed and Sung by GEORGE WELLING, the Great ,iomique. 
Am.—Dublin Ca ruta a. 
MY name is Denny Conner, I 
am a 
charcoal man, 
And if you will but listen, you'll see I'm an Irishman, 
I 
was born in Dublin City, that place of great renown, 
But now I'm here in America and peddling charcoal 
through the town. 
CHORUS. 
Charcoal is my cry, I 
make the old horse git, 
And if he qoes go slow you'll bet I 
use the whip, 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, her name was Rosy 
Ann, 
She said I 
was"a genius and she'd have no other man; 
But now she's gone and left me, for a 
fellow by the name 
of McGee, 
Who peddles sawdust around the the city and my Rosy 
no more I'll see. 
Charcoal is my cry, & c. 
One day when they were riding the horse he took a 
fright, 
And ran away with Rosy and never stopped till night, 
He ran way up to Harlem Bridge, Rosy screamed with all 
her might, 
He upset the charcoal wagon and threw Rosy out of 
sight. 
Charcoal is my cry, &c. 
When McGee saw this cruel thing, it was more than he 
could stand, 
He drew out his revolver and blew himself off the 
land, 
So now I'm left alone, to lead a 
single life, 
And to peddle charcoal as you see, with nO Rosy for my 
wife. 
Charcoal is my cry, &c.

By Killarney's lakes and fell; 
Em'rald isles and winding bays, 
Mountain paths and woodland dells. 
Mem'ry ever fondly strays. 
Bounteous nature loves all lands, 
Beauty wanders ev' ry where, 
Footprints leaves on many strands; 
But her home is surely there) 
Angels fold their wings, and rest 
In that Eden of the west, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Innisfallen's ruin'd shrine, 
May suggest a 
passing sigh, 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by, 
Castle Lough and Glenna Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagle's Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Ange's wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye, 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints. 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn Spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries daff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney, 
Music there for Echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swell; 
Till it faints in ecstacy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud wreaths in that sky. 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine, 
Beauty's home. Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

THE DUBLIN DANCING MASTER. 
Sung by Master BARNEY. 
IN Dublin city once there lived, 
A 
craythur gay an' hearty, oh! 
A 
dandle master he by thrade, 
His name was Teddy M'Carthy, oh ! 
He taught the girls and boys to dance, 
And none could do so faster— 
He always danced so nate and nice; 
Did this Dublin Dancin' master. 
CHORUS. 
With his down the middle ! hands across! 
Go a 
little faster, oh, 
In an' out and round about 
The Dublin Dania' tuasther, oh I 
SPOKEN.—Mr. M' Carthy, allow me to inthroduce to yer notice, 
Mr. Cornelius Fitzpelthers Pitzfoozle O'Shaughnessy, a 
new pu-
pil. 
Och, how do you do, sir, you're a 
pupiave had in my 
eye for many a 
day, and I 
assure you, sir, you could not put 
yourself in better hands for the practice of your feet. 
This is 
something of your style of (Litwin' I 
presume sir ? ( Dances a 
Spanish waltz.) Now, Sir, just thry that. (Imitates an awkward 
pupil.) 
Alt, sir, I'm afeard 
nivir make a dancer; your 
legs are not fellows; however, HI see if I 
can't cure you in time. 
Now Teddy taught both reels and jigs, 
And all the other dances, 
From Highland fling to plain quadrille, 
To please the ladies' fancies. 
Patsey Whelan, Mickey Flynn, 
And a 
boy called Kit McAsthor, 
Kent to learn a 
Highland fling 
From the Dublin (Litwin' masther.

Mr. Patsey Whelan—Miss Honoria Wheelbarrow. Now, leedies 
and gintlemin, plase to teek yer places for a &otch reel. ( Dances 
Highland fling.) 
Thus Teddy got the boys and girls, 
Proficient in their dances— 
Polkas, jigs and schottisches, 
Mazourkas, reels and lancers, 
No matter what the dance he taught, 
None could go it faster, 
And none could dance an Irish jig, 
Like the Dublin dancin' masther. 
Down the middle, dm 
SPOKEN. — NOW leedies and gintlemin, teek your places for the 
next dance; you see how tine you're gettin on. 
Our family 
were always celebrated for their dancin' propinsities; my yolk--
est son, although not as old as his eldest brother, could dance a 
jig before he was able to walk; and now for the next dance. 
(Dances Irish jig. ) 
End with Chorus.—Down the middle. 
ERIN, MY COUNTRY, 
OH! ERIN, my country, though strangers may roam 
Thy hills and thy mountains I

Thy lakes and thy valleys no longer I

But warmly as ever my heart beats for thee. 
CHORUS. 
Oh "Cushla Machree" my heart beats for thee, 
Erin! Erin! my heart beats for thee. 
Long years have passed o'er us since the last time we met, 
But lived I

The warm heart that loved me, 
The bright eyes that shone 
Like stars in the heaven of days that are gone. 
Oh! "Cushla Machree," &e. 
Dear home of my youth, I

But memory treasures the bright days of yore: 
And my heart's latest wish, the last sigh of my breast 
Shall be for thee, dear home, the : and of Le west.

AIR—Bloated Young Aristocrat. 
Written and Sung by the great ROACH, Irish Comique. 
AN Irishman named Paddy Carey, 
has come to sing for you to-night; 
I 
came from a 
town in Tipperary, 
Where we had many a 
light : 
But the girls and the boys there are witty, 
You can bet your last cent upon that, 
And in my OW11 beautiful city, 
They call me Bowld Irish Pat. 
Cm:mu& 
Yes, you can see by the way that I 
talk, 
The shape of my stick and hat, 
Sober or tight, Pin in for a 
fight, 
Hurrah, boys, for Bowld Irish Pat. 
The Saxon of late has been us troublin', 
That's the reason Chat I 
came away, 
I 
paid my passage down to Dublin, 
And then I 
crossed over the sea; 
When I 
landed safe in thi.3 city, 
I 
was met by a 
chap they called Mat, 
Who welcomed me to this country, 
Saying, how are you, Bowld Irish Pat. 
Yes, you can see by the way, &c. 
But I 
like the ways of this country, 
Where a 
man can live by his toil, 
And if he is earnest and patient, 
He may soon own a 
bit of the soil: 
I'vE ' 10•1411t a fine farm down in Jersey, 
And am • • -)
Inf,Y to live upon that, 
And if ,,• ant to come and see me, 
You'll ho welcomed by Bowld Irish Pat.

CI-roans. 
Any tinware to mend, any tinware to mend, 
I'm the boy can mend your pans, your pots, your kitties and 
your cans; 
Any tinware to mend, any tinware to mend, 
They call me roving Irish Jack the tinker. 
They told me when I 
left the old dart, it's some time now, of 
course, 
A 
rolling stone where o'er it goes it seldom gathers moss. 
But I 
am one that's not too fast, I 
never go too soon, 
For I 
belong to Butler's club, and keep one eye on silver spoons. 
Any tinware to mend, &c.

She is sure to bring her pots and pans the holes for me to stop

bother, 
I 
never fail to use on her some of the same soft solder.

But mother"—" Oh I

" 
But mother he's going away, 
And I

Of his ghost all in white, 
Oh! mother, he's going away." 
" 
If he's going away all the better, 
Blessed hour when he's out of your sight, 
There's one comfort you can't get a 
letter, 
For yez neither can read nor write, 
'Twas list week you protested, 
When he courted fat Biddy 3facree, 
That the sight of the scamp you detested, 
Wid abuse, sure, your tongue never rested—." 
" 
But mother !"—" Oh, bother!" 
"But mother he's going away; 
And I

Walk'd round my bed-post, 
Oh! mother he's going away,"

PAT O'BRIEN. 
PAT O'BRIEN is my name, I'll tell you, boys, from *where I 
came. 
Ould Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy, 
No country is so dear to me as the little isle stands near the 
sea, 
Where all the boys are blithe and free, deny it if you can. 
OuId Ireland is the place where they're famed for fun and mirth, 
Its equal can't be found if you search all o'er the earth: 
Good natured boys and girls are there, with none of them you 
can compare, 
Where every heart is free from care, that makes an Irish boy. 
CHORUS, 
Pat O'Brien is my name I'll tell you boys, from where I 
came, 
OuId Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy. 
Dan O'Connell, ould Ireland's friend, he struggled hard for to 
defcnd, 
'Gainst all invaders who did intend to claim poor Paddy's land; 
lie advocated Ireland's right with all his main and all his might, 
And he was poorly recompensed for all his toil and pains, 
In high courts of justice he caused them all to stare: 
With his knowledge, wit, and humor, to hear him it was rare; 
He always proved poor Paddy's friend when on his trial he did 
attend, 
He caused the noblest back to bend to the honest Irishman. 
Pat O'Brien is my name, & c. 
In eighteen forty-four gone by, out countrymen they had to fly 
For, famine stared in every eye along ould Ireland's shore; 
They to America did sail, leaving their wives and babies to wail; 
They were determined not to fail, but t:-:eir hardships to endure: 
The harp that once through Tara's Halls, shall strike each cord 
again 
To welcome back those exiles from across the raging main. 
May peace and plenty ever be to our little Isle that stands near 
the sea! 
Mq

PADDY BURKE was a 
man of work, from Limerick towA 
came, 
He married a 
buxom Irish lass, and she went by the namr of 
Kane; 
Now Pat f:fid his wife, through six years' strife, were pi ver 
blessed with a 
child, 
And when she seen one in any one's arms, this is what sue'd 
Rock the cradle, Pat, rock the cradle, Pat, 
There's many a 
man would give his right arm, 
To have a 
child like that. 
Now the war broke out, and Paddy, stout, he swore he.d go 
and ' list; 
To hear his wife s 
tongue always ding-dong, ' twould drive him 
out of his wits; 
So oil' he went, left her to repent, for doing a 
thing 2o wrong, 
For fathering him with that mortal sin, and singing that beastly 
song: 
Rock the cradle, Pat, (to. 
Now Paddy Burke, this man oi work, he hadn't been long 
away. 
Till his wife fell in with a 
big spalpeen who soon led her astray; 
For three years long there love was strong, till one tine summer's 
day, 
Paddy Burke, this man of work, came ;Singing her favorite lay: 
Rock the cradle, Pat, .kc. 
Well, Pat looked round, and soon he found a 
baby hale and 
strong. 
And turning to his wife, the pride of his life, said, 
" 
Who has been here since I 
was gone ?" 
"It was ProvEence, Pat," she said, " done that, he was good 
to me three years long, 
Ancnow you can, with my other man, sing my favorite song.

THE DEAR LITTLE SnArnaca, 
THERE'S a 
sweet little spot, away down by Cape Clear, 
Sure, it's Ireland herself, to all Irishmen dear; 
Where the white praties blossom like illigant flowers, 
And the wild birds sing sweetly above tii.,. round towers; 
And the dear little Shamrock that none can withstand, 
Is the beautiful Emblem of Old Ireland, 
In his hat, good St. Patrick used always to wear,' 
The Shamrock, whenever he went to a 
fair; 
And Nebuchadnezzar, no doubt highly prized 
A 
bit of the blossom when he went disguis;;Al; 
For, the bosom of beauty itself might expand, 
When bedecked by the Shamrock of Old Irelana, 
When far, far away, a 
sweet blossom I've seen, 
I've dreamt of Shillelaghs and Shamrocks so green; 
That grow, like two twins, on the bogs and the hilts, 
With a 
drop in my eye, that with joy may heart fills; 
And Iv'e blessed the dear sod from a 
far distwit strand, 
And the beautiful Shamrock of Old Ireland.

THE GOAT. 
NOW my dear friends, I'm going to relate, 
It you pay attention, you've not long to wait; 
Aly father lived in a 
place called Gramote, 
lie bad a 
sow, and a 
cow, and a 
fine billy goat. 
This goat, sure, he had a 
queer, curious way, 
He'd go oat every morning and stop out all day; 
Whorl he'd come home at night, like a 
bull he would roar, 
'Till my father gets up for to open the door. 
One day we sat down, and was going to ate, 
The goat leap'd on the table and sthole all the mate; 
And without saying a 
word, share the dirty ould gommagh, 
He druv his two horns in me poor father's stomach. 
Says me mother to me, " Jamsey," " Tis mam," says I, 
" 
Take that goat to the market, and sell him, now thry." 
The words she scarce spoke, when the goat, gave a 
jump, 
And .5thruck me mother, oh gorra I 
such a 
murthering thump. 
Then all the house bate a 
hasty retrato, 
And the goat backed away at the 
own rate; 
lie spied my father's coat banging, be gave a 
loud bawl, 
Afaxle a 
charge on the " frize." and drily his head in the wall. 
Some time rather they went to Vol: for the goat.. 
They searched all around, ' tilt they came to the coat. 
All of tne goat that was left on the very next day, 
Was only the sthamp ot his tail, and it still bucking away.

THE COT IN THE CORNER. 
OCII hone, wirrastew, how hard is our lot, 
The landlord has turned us out of our cot, 
To us in this world ' twas the happiest spot, 
On the 11:1.-side beyant in the corner; 
The roof was thatched over with bright yellow straw, 
And the walls were as white as the snowflake agra, 
Oh it was a 
fine picture a 
painter might draw, 
From the boreen beyant in the corner. 
It was purty without, it was tidy within, 
On the shelves, shone like silver, our plate made of tin, 
Which cast some reflections when sunlight stole in, 
On lir.; dog and the cat in the corner; 
Of bacon, galore, we had many a 
flitch in, 
The wid2-mouthed chimn;.,,y, that yawned in the kitchen, 
Oh mould make your mouth water, and eager to pitch in, 
To the ' lames that hung high in the corner. 
And there by the fire my mother would knit, 
And close to her side my ould father would sit, 
What stories he'd tell when his dudeen was lit, 
While he smoked away in the corner; 
When supper was over the neighbors dropped in, 
And by the turf fire each roasted his shin, 
WI.ile the boys and the girls ne'er thought it a 
sin 
For to hug and to kiss in the corner. 
When Jimmy, the piper, walked in on the floor, 
The young people all made a 
rush for the door, 
Dragging Jimmy along to the barn and sure 
They Flaced him high up in the corner; 
Then at it they went, dear, with hearts light and gay, 
And danced the night hours into the young day, 
'Till Jimmy got drunk an' no longer could play, 
For he lay pipes and all in the corner.

MARY OF THE WILD 3100a 
ft was on one cold Winter's night, 
As the wind blew across the wild moor, 
When Mary came wandering home with her baba, 
'Till she came to her own father's door. 
° 
Oh! father, dear father, she cried, 
Come down and open the door, 
Or the child in my arms will perish and die, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor. 
°Oh! why did I 
leave this dear spot, 
Where once I 
was happy and free, 
But now, doomed-to roam without friends or home, 
And no one to take pity on me." 
The old man was deaf to her cries, 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear, 
But the watch-deg howled and the village bell tollid, 
And the wind blew across the wild moor. 
But how must the old man have felt, 
When he came to the door in the morn, 
Poor Mary was dead, but the child was alive, 
Closely pressed in its dead mother's arms. 
Half frantic he tore his gray hair, 
And the tears down his cheeks they did pour, 
saying, " This cold Winter's night she perislid and diet, 
By the cold wind that blew across the wild moor: 
rho old man in grief pined away, 
And the child to its mother went soon, 
And no one, they say, has lived there to this day, 
And the cottage to ruin has gone. 
The villagers point cut the spot, 
Where the willow droops over the door, 
Baying, " There Mary died, once a 
gay village brrde, 
My the wind that Llows across the wild moor."

Music by H. W ANNEMICISEE. 
Sung by JENNIE H UGHES. 
FAREWELL to thee Erin, dear home of my childhood, 
Farewell to thy valleys, thy mountains and hills ; 
Farewell to thy lakes and thy evergreen wildwood, 
Farewell to thy brooks and thy murmuring rills; 
No more shall I 
dwell in the land of my sires, 
No more thy green banner above me shall wave; 
Forever is quenched freedom's bright fires, 
For thy tyrants have doomed me the life of a 
slave. 
In exile and bondage in my dreams still I 
wander, 
To every loved object will fond memory soar; 
And on thy lost glories forever will ponder, 
Dear land of my fathers, old Erin-go-Bragh ! 
But the battle is over, and the cause we have fought for 
Is lost to us now, yet one boon would I 
crave, 
That still I 
may find what in battle I 
sought for, 
A 
grave ' neath thy shamrock, not the fate of a 
slave. 
Thy green velvet-cheek that is kissed by the ocean, 
Now fastly is fading away from my sight; 
But with tears and with sighs and heartfelt emotion, 
I 
wish thee, dear country, forever good night. 
To the land of the stranger in bondage they bear me, 
Yet grant me, kind heaven, the boon that I 
crave, 
Break though my heart; but this agony spare me, 
Let me die as a 
freeman, and not as a 
slave. 
THEY sailed away in a 
gallant bark, 
Roy Neill and his fair young bride, 
He had ventured all in that bounding ark 
That (-timed o'er the silvery tide ; 
But his he trt was young, and his spirit light, 
And he dashed the tear away, 
As he watched the shore recede from sight, 
Of his own sweet Dublin Bay. 
Three days they sailed, and a 
storm arose. 
And the lightning swept the deep, 
And the thunder crash broke the short repose 
Of the weary sea bo3 'a 
sleep. 
Roy Neill, he clasped his weeping bride, 
And he kissed her tears away. 
! 
Love, ' twas a 
fatal hour, she cried, 
When we left sweet Dublin Bay 
On the crowded deck of the doomed ship, 
Some stood in their mute despair; 
And some, more calm, with a 
holy lip, 
Sought the God of the storm in prayeD, 
She has struck on a 
rock! the seaman cried, 
In the breath of their wild dismay— 
And the ship went down, and the fair young bride 
That sailed from Dublin Bay.

THE IRISH POTATO. 
Parody on the •` Old Oak,e;?. Bucket." 
HOW sweet to the taste is the Irish potato, 
As memory awakens the thought of the plant! 
Its dark, verdant vine-top, and beautiful blossom, 
In pleasant transition my memory haunt; 
I 
thought of the root in profusion once growing 
On the broad sunny hill- slope adjoining the mill, 
At the homestead how many we raised there's no knowing 
For seine were but small ones, and few in a 
hill. 
CHORUS. 
The mealy potato, the Irish potato, 
The thin-skinned potato that grew on the hi& 
That delectable plant I'll prize while Fin able, 
For often at noon when return ad from the field, 
I 
found it superior to all on the table— 
The best flavored edible that nature could yield, 
With what eager appetite, sharpened by labor, 
I 
plied knife and fork with a 
hearty good will ! 
Alas! there are none of the old-fashioned flavor, 
None like the real " shawls" that grew on the hill. 
The mealy, &c. 
How prime from the full heapen dish to receive it, 
As, poised on my fork, it ascends to my mouth ! 
No appeal to the palate could tempt me to leave it, 
Though affected by rot on a 
long stuinnT's drouth; 
And now far removed from that sit nation, 
Where I 
used te partake of the root to my 
hill, 
Fancy fain would revert to my father's plantation, 
And sigh for the " kidney" that grew on the hill.

CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
To those who have never perused the sad story of Cuamorra 
TzmpLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sympathised and 
wept with her in her sorrows, ad glowed with indignation at the 
wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, an oppor-
tunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works ever 
written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfortunate 
Charlotte Temple: 
Tier form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah 1 
the cruel spoiler came---" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rosyson, " affords a 
striking 
example that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the 
end leads only to misery and shame.

The subject is divided into three parts. 
The first includes the 
principles and practice of the bC11001 of sparring, with remarks on 
the set-to. 
The second consists of means of attack and defence of 
a 
more difficult nature to make an accomplished sparrer, and a 
description of a 
set-to. 
The third includes wrestling and train-
ing; attacks that may be expected from rough or unskilled per-
sons, and methods of avoiding the same; remarks on gymnastic 
exercises, etc. 
The lessons are laid out in a 
systematic and simple manner, 
which will impart a good foundation of knowledge on the sub-
ject, so that by practising the rules one may attain to the utmost 
perfection. 
The book is written as the scholar should progress, and those 
parts to which special attention Is directed should be practised 
thoroughly, the advantage of which will become apparent in sub-
sequent lessons, in which will be found everything necessary to 
make a 
complete sparrer.
