Shantar uibson interviewed by Setare Arashioo and tsarrie Uine 
Setare Arashioo: As they explained, these are the base question that we ask from other colleagues and 
other electricians in the trade. Feel free to add onto something that you may feel is not part of the 
question necessarily, or just comes to mind. Some of them are just, share a story [00:00:30] if you feel 
like it, things like that. It's not, I'll ask a question, you answer particularly, because ... Go on with 
whatever you feel like expressing. 
Shantar: Okay. 
Setare Arashioo: Please tell me your name and your job title, and where you live. 
Shantar: My name's Shantar Gibson. I'm a local 3AJ electrician, and I currently reside in Orange, 
New Jersey. 
Setare Arashioo: [00:01:00] Good. Did you have another profession prior to this?Tell us a little bit 
about your background. How did you become an electrician? 
Shantar: Yes, I had various entities before this. Right before I got into the local, I was a manager 
at an arts store, but my career before this was graphic design. I went to Pratt for 
communication design. I got an accredited degree from them. [00:01:30] Went into the 
industry, worked for a while. The industry started to become more freelance, and I 
could see the writing on the wall. Just to protect myself, I started looking in other 
places. 
Setare Arashioo: Good, and that's how you started at the local? 
Shantar: No, getting into the local, I started with ... I was just kicking around actually. I'm an 
artist, all day long, and that always overrides whatever's going on. I try to fit it in 
[00:02:00] on my path. Went and worked in arts store, just to have a little bit of money 
coming in, but I could really focus on what I was doing. I met a lot of great people there. 
I winded up getting laid off from there for some weird paperwork error, and just being a 
brown person, the fact that the paperwork error had money attached to it, I felt very 
uncomfortable with it. I decided that I would never do another job that had money 
involved, because of [00:02:30] the stereotypes and just the way it always in my opinion 
goes down. 
I was like, "this is it for me, I need somewhere where my integrity will always be held 
up." I was wandering around again, many of my entities. I learned how to tattoo along 
the way. I was always tattooing and I helped my friend open a shop in Brooklyn. It was 
called, Tough Girl Tattoos. I helped run that for a year. While I was doing that, one day I 
was riding my bike in the city just hanging out with a friend, and [00:03:00] we saw a 
construction site, and we just were scoffing at it. It was like, "How did they get those 
jobs? I'm so annoyed. That flag waver must be making gazillions of dollars. I want that." 
While we were on the bike ride, my friend disappeared and came back and was like, "Oh 
I just talked to this lady from [Carnett 00:03:16] and she said she went through this 
program." Then that kicked back to two years before, when I was still in school, I saw a 
bus station that had this picture on it with a lady hanging off the side of a building. I was 
[00:03:30] like, "Man, that looks cool." I took a picture of it at the time, stored it, but I 
was like, "Yeah, I'm going to go hang off the side of buildings." It was already stored in 
my psyche. 
On that bike ride, her talking about it, I went home that night and called the next day. It 
moved so fast. They were like, "Come in on Wednesday," blah blah blah. Took the 
entrance exam and then next thing you know I was in N.E.W, on my way to the trades. I 
didn't know ... I knew it was electrical. I came in there wanting to do that, but [00:04:00] 
once we were doing the math and everything I was like, "Ooo, I don't know if..." I've 
spent a lot of life right brained, I don't know if I'm ready to transition to left brain. I 
didn't give it enough attention growing up. 
Once we completed the program, they were like, "You're totally set. You're made for 
electrical. That should be [inaudible 00:04:20], or response for you to go into that." That 
was it. Took the test, and the rest is history. 
Setare Arashloo: Did you have any family members or people [00:04:30] you know who were in the 
trade or any kind of- 
Shantar: No, not at all. Sight unseen. 
Setare Arashloo: Cool. Do you remember the first day of your job? 
Shantar: Yes. I woke up, and I set out really early, like 5:30 in the morning to get to work on time. 
It was in midtown, and it was on Park Avenue. It was very intimidating. I had this 
address which was 110 Park Avenue. I was there early, standing there. I don't even 
[00:05:00] really drink coffee, but I was like, "I'm going to get me a cup of coffee. I'm just 
going to jump right into this role." While I'm waiting I'm like, "Oh," I call my foreman and 
I'm like, "Yeah, how you get into the building? Nobody knows where you guys are, who 
you are." He goes, "Well where are you?" I'm like, "110 Park Avenue." He's like, "Oh no, 
we're at 101 Park Avenue." Switched the numbers. 
I went from being early and on time, to late. I was like, "Ugh." Walking in, the first 
[00:05:30] job I was on was Aetna, the insurance company. I walk in, it's this massive 
room, this weird lights hanging, there's drilling, and people are flying passed you with 
sheet rock, duct work. I was just, my knees were literally shaking. I don't scare easily, 
but I have to admit that I was humbled. I wouldn't say intimidated, but I was definitely 
humbled. I was like, "I am open to learning. I don't want to get hurt. This looks crazy. 
[00:06:00] I'm excited about this." I met my foreman, he joked around, I didn't get the 
jokes right away. That was the first day, that I remember, being late. 
Shantar Gibson 
Page 2 of 13 
Setare Arashloo: 
Do you remember one of the jokes? 
Shantar: Huh? 
Setare Arashloo: Do you remember any of the jokes? 
Shantar: Oh, yeah actually. I say it to people now. He was like, "Oh, what are you? ATA1? I could 
smell the similac on your breath," you know like you're a brand new baby. He's like, "Oh 
I could smell the similac. Oh we got a new fish," like when you go to jail. It's [00:06:30] 
like, "Don't bring attention to me." Yeah, that was the first day. 
Setare Arashloo: Cool. 
Shantar: My first foreman was Pat [Morithio 00:06:37]. Still remember him. He's a good guy. 
Setare Arashloo: Have you ever passed on any tools to a colleague or have you had any tools 
passed onto you? 
Shantar: Well yes, in the backwards order. I had tools passed onto me, and then I went onto to 
emulate the things that I saw. I think my [00:07:00] character naturally has, which I 
wasn't aware of, leadership qualities, organizing qualities, and the ability to adapt to 
new situations. It wasn't often tested as an artist, because you just you see the uniform 
of artists and you immediately feel comfortable. Ear lobe piercings, mohawks, died hair, 
you're like, "Okay you're not a threat," but khaki shirts, button downs, you don't know 
where this is going to go. If you're going to just [00:07:30] pummel me with left [this 
00:07:31] ideals all day, while I don't care what you think. 
I thought I was going to be at arms in this world. Whereas, once I started to meet people 
and just see their work ethic, it didn't really matter what came out of their mouth 
because I was like, "You're a good person, because you do the right thing with your time 
and space." Now where you're getting your information from, a lot of people need to do 
a lot more research. I'm not [00:08:00] going to fault you for that. You're human. That 
learning process, how to get along with people that I previously would've assumed that I 
wouldn't have anything in common with, that was a huge gift. Once you start getting 
along with different people, you start to move into a role of comfort and then by 
default, leadership and artistry will come out, because you start to feel like yourself. You 
don't have to layer yourself with defenses. You can just start to loosen your belt a little 
bit and be like, "Well I actually [00:08:30] would like to chime in on this conversation. I 
have an opinion." Again, after you learn the lay of the land. 
Other people who actually taught me something, it was the way that they interacted 
with me. They made me feel comfortable, the way that they took the time to break 
down information. They were constantly telling me, "You're going to be this in the 
future." I was just like, "I don't understand what you're seeing, because who doesn't 
work this hard?" I'm coming from having three jobs. I didn't know that there [00:09:00] 
was a world that existed where people had a high paying jobfrom 18 years old, and 
never knew any ills of where's the rent money going to come from, and so on and so 
Shantar Gibson

forth. They've just been on easy street. They don't know what it's like to be a janitor or a 
waiter, or anything else in the world. I was coming in with that perspective and 
background, and to see that there were still people who are humble and willing to share 
their knowledge, and not cover up what they had. 
Me being [00:09:30] brown, woman, gay, I have a lot of things going. It's not like any of 
those are hide able in my situation. I learned a lot just coming in with my defenses and 
how people were able to put me at ease. Through me feeling at ease, it made me feel 
more comfortable to step out of my role of just working, and see where else I could 
expand my branches. They put us in college, which I didn't even know it came [00:10:00] 
with it. That was a bonus. Once we started going to college, it was okay, these are labor 
classes. I had no clue about the labor movement whatsoever. Once I started to hear 
about that, I again, started to paint without them even knowing because I've always 
been searching for this ultimate topic that could be universal and never pin holed me 
like, "Oh I pick cubism and now I'm stuck there. If I want to do figures, I can't go 
anywhere else." 
I was like, "Labor, wait a second." [00:10:30] This affects everyone. It's never going to go 
away. It's a positive. It's a negative. I was like, "Okay." Then receiving all the information 
in some of the classes we had here, arts and labor. The books that we were reading, I 
think it was literature and labor, they were actually fun classes here. It wasn't all just 
civil rights, labor using, women's rights, [ash 00:10:53], everything in a row. It was 
seamless and it started to feel like the schooling and the life [00:11:00] that I had 
before. I was like, "This is great. Everything's just melding together." Once, took the art 
class here, we jumped out off of projects that we had in class and it sprung outside the 
door. 
That's when I saw, I had that aha moment. I was like, "Uh oh, this is a bridge to 
something. I didn't leave anything behind." It's actually, you just never know where 
you're going to wind up in life, but I was like, "Holy cow, I'm on the right path. I was 
supposed to go this way. How did I know?" I stumbled [00:11:30] in it, and you always 
think you could see it coming, you'll have all these plans. I still wound up where I was 
supposed to be without even trying. It was almost after I'd given up. I'm just like, "Ah, I 
just need money right now. I can't even." The art coming out of it, and the n just through 
the art and teaching on the job, being taught on the job. Then I started to go back and 
volunteer at the trade school that I came from, which was NEW, Non-traditional 
Employment for Women. 
Whenever I would speak to [00:12:00] them, they called them trade speakers, you come 
back and speak to new classes who are coming in. Whenever I would go back, they'd 
pull me to the side and be like, "That was a really dynamic conversation." I was like, 
"Well, if I'm talking about something that I care about, and I can't see the ..." Because 
I'm actually a really shy person, you'd be surprised, but when certain topics and things 
inspire me, I can tuck my shy person away and I'm just snap into another character and 
be, there's more to be had than to worry a bout [00:12:30] being shy. Your knees 
knocking? Get over it. Through talking to the women and them saying, "You're really 
dropping some pearls of wisdom. There's no really way to categorize what you're doing, 
but we'd like you to come back more often." 
Shantar Gibson

Barrie Cline: 
Shantar: 
Then, that transitioned for more trade speaking, to getting a position there teaching an 
electrical class. They're like, "While you're teaching electrical if you could go ahead and 
slide in some of those pearls of wisdom, so that..." Not that they're trying to create 
cookie cutter people, but so that they can [00:13:00] have a success rate with people 
really understanding what they're getting into, and bringing what I learned in college 
into that place, the labor studies, and all of that together. With that whole long story, 
following forward, out of nowhere, I came in as an apprentice. I was tired. I had to learn 
from scratch. I had no clue what I was doing. At first, I was complete raw clay to, now I 
understand what I'm doing. [00:13:30] I'm very rarely, unlike the majority of women 
that I've come across, not that they're doing anything wrong, but I've never been laid off 
or put into any of the stereotypical roles that I've heard of. 
Because everybody's like, "You're doing something phenomenal." To me it's like, "But 
I'm doing what you guys are doing. You just don't give the guys credit for it. You're just 
making it extra special because it's a girl doing it." My end goal is just be like, "I just 
want to be known as a good mechanic, not the good girl mechanic." I've achieved that. 
[00:14:00] Finishing school here, I've achieved that. Going back to volunteer, all these 
achievements change your perspective and I didn't know that. That's the end of it I 
guess. 
Would you maybe walk us through a typical day on the job that you're at now, so we 
could get a good picture of what every day work, or extraordinary work is like? 
Okay. I'm right now, at the NYU [Lancome 00:14:26] Center on 34th and 1st Avenue. 
We're doing [00:14:30] the Kimmel building. There's a science building, and two new 
additions, but I'm in the Kimmel building. They have these strange turnstiles that you 
have to scan in, in the morning. Then you have to go through this obstacle course of 
rocks and pipes, and I personally enjoy it because I like the outdoors. I'm just like, "Ooo, 
this is really menacing. Be careful. Anything could happen at anytime," but I enjoy the 
entry way. I get there really early before the sun's up. I just like the walk [00:15:00] from 
Penn station, nice and quiet. 
Once I'm on the job, we go, we meet in a shanty. All the early birds, I didn't used to be 
the early bird, but I just again added something new to my personality. Now that I'm 
one of the early birds, there's a whole level of conversation that happens before all the 
people who trail in about 15 minutes before. You really get to know some of the people 
that you don't get to work with all day, which is kind of cool. I started doing the 
crossword puzzle, which I'm very excited about. That's one of my new [00:15:30] 
routines. I didn't even know I'd like something like that, but now I'm a crossword fiend. 
We go outside. They started this new program, which is called, stretch and flex. We 
actually get an extra half hour in the morning for aerobics and stretching. Everybody 
gripes and groans, but not for nothing. I take advantage of it, because we're working 
really hard and I'm like, "My bones hurt. Everything's tight." Just by doing stretch and 
flex, each person had a flex that I [00:16:00] didn't know. I was like, "This hurts," and 
they're like, "Do this one." Now out of nowhere, he's like, "Okay, Shantar's leading us 
now in stretch and flex, because she knows all the techniques." Everybody who was 
griping and groaning, they don't say anything, but they stand there. The group went 
Shantar Gibson 
Page 5 of 13 
from two people doing it and 20 people standing looking at you, to everyone's actually 
doing it to the best of their capacity, because we just quietly kept doing it. It was like, 
"No, this actually is really helping," so that happens. 
Then I'm the 5th floor, so I walk up the stairs. There's no elevator. [00:16:30] Once I get 
to the 5th floor, I have a female shanty, of which has been invaded by some of my male 
counterparts. It's the shanty now, and we have to do this whole routine of switching 
from street clothes to high vis clothes, putting on a harness, getting the controller for 
the lift. This is a no ladder job, so we're on drivable lifts. I gather my whole day, go set 
up in my section, and [00:17:00] then I have some tunes very low in my phone. I put my 
one earphone in, so that I could still hear what's going on, but I can groove to some 
really good music. I start my day. 
Right now, I'm working on conduit, which I'm very excited about because females don't 
get to work on it that often. This foreman didn't give me the whole speech of, "Can you 
run conduit?," all the doubt. He was just like, "You're on this." Inside, I was just really 
excited like a kid in a candy store. I was like, [00:17:30] "Yeah, I'm goingto hit it. Finally, 
my day in the sun." After nine years, when you think it can't get anymore exciting, now 
I'm really excited. People come over, they try to distract me and talk by my lift, and I'm 
like, "Sshh, would you be quiet? I'm having fun here and you're distracting me from 
what I feel like doing today." 
Very excited about my conduit run. It looks gorgeous. You know what I mean? People 
coming by, they're looking at it. There's no, "Oofs," or nasty reactions. There's more like, 
"Hey, when you're done there, come finish mines." [00:18:00] I'm like, "That means it's 
going well." I'm envisioning the whole thing, and it's working out. Then we go through 
all the many breaks that we have, and we wrap the day up. Then at the end of the day, I 
get into shenanigans. Interviews, art, hanging out with my dog, stuff like that. 
Setare Arashloo: Can you explain a little bit, what is the conduit run? 
Shantar: Yeah conduit is electric ... They're goingto get mad if I mess this up. [00:18:30] I believe 
it's electric metallic tubing. It's three quarter conduit. A recent project we worked on, 
we used that conduit to build the bench and to bring it 3D off of the wall. When you 
have a run, they give you a set of prints, and they just show you point A and point B. 
This is where you're freelance worker/freelance artist, and they go, "Get there how you 
get there. I can't instruct you on how to do it, but don't do it ugly. [00:19:00] Don't do it 
aggressively," meaning don't shoot across the ceiling and just cut off the space so that 
no one else can follow you. Look what's there, join the party, and just blend into the 
flow of what's already in the ceiling, while also supporting it and making sure that it's 
sound and neat. 
You have to make your own supports, a length of conduit is 120 inches, 10 feet. One 
[00:19:30] person with an arm span of six feet, has to maneuver a tenth of pipe. It gets 
interesting to be in one place and the other, and you have to come up with different 
ways to support it while you run from here to there, so that it doesn't fall down. Even 
that part of it is probably the most fascinating. How can you be two people at once? 
That's my favorite part of it. 
Shantar Gibson 
Page 6 of 13 
Seta re Arashloo: 
Cool. 
Barrie Cline: What are some of the other skills that are [00:20:00] necessary?That's an interesting 
skill, what other skills that maybe you didn't expect you would need to have or what are 
some of the skills that really stand out for you in terms of- 
Shantar: Drivingthe lift. I don't drive at all. I'm only a bicycle person. They just throw you in this 
lift. They assume you can drive it. Already I was just like, "I don't do car... I failed my 
driving test three times." I was like, "Aahh." When I took off, it was one mile an hour, my 
turns were really wide. They're like, "What are you [00:20:30] doing? You all right in that 
lift?" No one ever jumps in and says, "Give me that," or corrects you. They just let you 
find your way with it. Now, I believe I can drive a car. Sight unseen. If you put me in a 
car, I think I can handle parallel parking now, because I can whip this thing in tight spots. 
They're like, "Wow you're a really good driver." I'm like, "See, you'd never know that I 
don't drive at all in real life." That's a great skill. 
Again, people skills really count. They have a saying, "There are professional ball 
[00:21:00] busters," is what they call them. I don't happen to be one of those. I work 
well with others, the other trades. I usually speak to everybody, so whenever we need 
something I, by accident, become the ambassador because no one else is talking to the 
other trades. "Can you ask them for this? I saw you talking to them the other day." I'm 
like, "They're standing right there. Less than a foot away. You could say something. They 
can hear you." That's a great skill. 
I [00:21:30] think I like that it keeps me fit. I really didn't take shape or working out at all 
important, but now I eat differently. I workout differently to make sure that I don't get 
injured on the job, so that's been a bonus for me. 
Seta re Arashloo: 
Cool. 
Shantar: Today, I got to spray paint boxes, so I was like, "Yea hi" There's a little art always in 
there, and being organized. You can come by, you can find all my material, [00:22:00] 
it's not a scene that looks like a catastrophe where your tools are on the floor. I watch 
some people work, and they're just reaching all day. They're spinning in their own 
tasmanian world, and it's just like, "There's no reason for that. Just stop. Place your 
things, and you don't have to walk around frantically, 'Where did I leave this?"' That's 
not my thing. I think being organized is a skill as well. 
Barrie Cline: Could you say a bit about what it means to you to be a union member? 
Shantar: [00:22:30] Yes. I personally am more of a loner, as a personality trait, but I do love 
joining causes and groups that are productive in doing things. Just from being an 
apprentice, I haven't seen it so much as a journeyman because I've been busy, but as an 
apprentice just throwing the Christmas parties, the food drives, a lot of the community 
work that they do, I felt more ease to participate because it wasn't going [00:23:00] in 
sight unseen, I don't know where to start. It was, we have this all in a big package and 
whether it's you wanting to help kids, you want to help with cancer, you want to help 
Shantar Gibson 
Page 7 of 13 
with an AIDS walk, you want to workout and lose weight together, you want to 
volunteer with habitat for humanity, you want to help with Sandy. There's all these 
different outlets. 
If you want to look into them, you can. They even have an art fair, which they invite 
people to bring not just [00:23:30] trades art, but just art in general that they participate 
with. That umbrella of just possibility, I like that it's a one stop shop. I feel already 
comfortable because we all have something in common. Again, it breaks down those 
barriers of being uncomfortable with new things and people. 
Setare Arashloo: I know you mentioned this, but maybe more specifically, what parts of your job 
feels most creative to you? If there [00:24:00] are. 
Shantar: From soup to nuts, the entire experience is creative whether you're pulling wire, it takes 
on this form as it moves through the ceiling, which is very seamless. I don't know if you 
remember the Matrix, but a lot of the devices in there that they use for those props are 
actually electrical tools. I always thought it was cool when I saw the movie, but then 
when I saw it in real life I was like, "Hey, those are the arms from the monsters in 
[00:24:30] the Matrix." You start hoarding material little by little with all these 
possibilities. 
They were throwing out exit signs and I saw these little LED lights and that they just 
snapped together, and they had a small battery backup. I was like, "Oh man, I'm going 
to make illuminated canvases, and paint on clear things and put lights behind them. 
Then when you turn on the light, that's the only way to see it. Make it a switch art 
instead of just a room light that comes on. I immediately just started making 
connections to what I was already [00:25:00] doing in life. Those things are some of the 
most important things. 
Even a panel, how they all come in in the colors, the sea mlessly just stack down. The 
tediousness of just sitting there and screwing something in over and over again, and 
preparing it, it feels exactly like when I'm painting because you need that same stillness. 
You sit, you Setare at the canvas, it's quiet, you take a dap, you walk away. [00:25:30] 
You look close, you stand back, and it's all of the same behavior as when I was painting 
as when I'm at work. It happens for every single task, except for coffees and delivery. 
Again, those are drab things that come along with the job, but every other thing is just 
about fascinating still to me. I'm not bored yet. 
Barrie Cline: What are your aspirations as an electrician? 
Shantar: I feel like I'm doing it already. I just really wanted to be good at it. I wanted it to be 
second [00:26:00] nature. I wanted to approach it the way that I know I'm going to wake 
up tomorrow, and that I have to go to sleep, and then I'm going to eat food. I wanted it 
to be part of my organic life. It has become that. 
Setare Arashloo: Have you ever feel scared at the job or intimidated with a task that you were 
given or an accident that you thought may happen? 
Shantar Gibson 
Page 8 of 13 
Shantar: 
You mean safety wise? 
Setare Arashloo: [00:26:30] Safety mostly. 
Shantar: No, I've never felt unsafe at all. That again, comes from my outdoorsy background. I 
always climb into that extra limb in the tree that you maybe should fear. I jump out of 
things. I have no problem. This was adding to that part of me. To me, I'm just a kid 
outside, playing in the dirt and I get paid for it. I was doing that already when I was little, 
going places that I shouldn't. I was attracted to old warehouses, [00:27:00] and "Oh that 
windows broken. I bet you something's cool in there. We could make it our own 
haunted house." It adds to your imagination, but instead I feel like this is the Charlie 
Brown factory. I don't know if you remember Charlie Brown and the Christmas tree, but 
that little part when they all run in and they beautify things. I feel like that's what we do. 
We Charlie Brown stuff. 
We come in, the building's dank, old, useless, and by the time we're done it's a marvel 
of what stands there afterwards. I don't even think half [00:27:30] of the guests or 
customers that inhabit the place after where they realize it, and just a personal spiritual 
thing. I believe you leave your energy places. I've gone to, I worked in a camp, and I 
went there when it was closed years later, and I stood on the black top, and I could still 
hear the kids, their laughter. Almost as if the energy was stored there. I believe that 
even if we don't get the necessary respect on the surface for building these [00:28:00] 
places, all the laughter, the conversations, the arguments, we leave it in there in the air. 
Spiritually, I feel like it's a nice connection for how many places you can be. I feel well 
traveled because of this job, for sure. 
Speakers: If there was something that you could change aboutthe work, what would it be, orthe 
work on the job site, or the culture of work? 
Shantar: I really would have more organization in the trades talk [00:28:30] better. I think that 
we've seen a thousand ... I'm only in nine years and I'm like, "There's a rhyme and 
there's a reason for this." If you put this in first, and then this, and then this, and then 
this, then this'll work. Instead, it's just, "Blah, everybody go at once." It's constantly 
what's causing the problem, in my opinion. They've tried to map this out ahead of time 
architects, and give out 3D drawings, but they still not scheduling us time wise 
[00:29:00] on the job, and they're not giving us enough space to create properly. 
Every time we do it faster and faster, they just keep speeding up the wheel. Instead they 
be like, "That was a special case, we did that," but we shouldn't always have to work 
that fast or else you're physically beating us up too fast. That's my opinion. 
Setare Arashloo: Do you feel you're getting paid enough for your job? 
Shantar: Not considering the scope of how much is being made for the job that we're performing, 
no. Not at all.

Barrie Cline: [00:29:30] Why are some of the ... What are some of the reasons behind that, that you 
think you should- 
Shantar: I feel like we're partnered almost, not 50%, but I feel like we're 30%/70%, at the very 
least in production because we're in the field. Any architect can sit in a room and draw 
up anything, but they cannot physically go into the field and manifest it. That part of 
being [00:30:00] an artisan is we add up to one artisan, but you get the good clean air in 
an office all the time, and you get six figures times two, no questions asked. Ours, 
questionable, whether you'll make enough to support yourself this year. Again, they 
flood it with a lot of people just in case. When there's a lot of work, they hire a lot of 
people. 
Then when the work slows down, there's still a lot of people. That's where the issue 
comes in, but [00:30:30] how it's being distributed as we go along, I feel is ... A safety 
individual I'm sure makes more. If you think about time and labor, makes more than us, 
only because they're walking around just like, "Hey, while you're creating, make sure 
you have this, this, and this on." I'm not against safety, I'm totally for it, I'm just saying 
all the layers of what they find important it's like, "Let's protect our insurance." Not 
necessarily [00:31:00] thoroughly concerned about your safety. It comes through the 
seams. I don't want to step on anyone's toes, but I do see politics. 
Maybe shares in these companies, I don't know. That way, if you're invested, you might 
treat something that you own differently. Maybe we start Turner. Why do we need to 
use [00:31:30] Turner to build? If you take collectively what all of these unions, their 
annuities and stuff like that is worth, you're looking at hundreds of millions. You could 
start your own thing. Start to build your own thing. I don't know how that works, but I'm 
just saying- 
Barrie Cline: [crosstalk 00:31:44] company. Something else. 
Shantar: Yeah, I'm just saying that waiting for a larger juggernaut to come in and to break off 
pieces to you, is one way. We're living in the age of empowerment, where people don't 
wait. They start music careers on the internet. [00:32:00] They start writing careers on 
the internet. They start movie careers on the internet. They start art projects and 
careers on the internet. You don't need as much top down, trickle down money in order 
to be wealthy or succeed. How we get into that new paradigm, I'm not sure, but I'm sure 
havingthe youth and training us and giving us exposure to newer information, 
something's going to bud from it somehow. Even if it's stuff that happens outside of 
work. 
Setare Arashloo: [00:32:30] What do you think about furlough? 
Shantar: I personally think it's a great idea, but I know others don't. I'll just stick to my own 
opinion, because others aren't here. I think that it's a great idea because it shows a 
concern for your fellow brother like, "Oh they hired too many people." Who cares? I 
have a job. Who cares what happens to you? Furlough is actually the act of saying, every 
one of us should ... I'm willing to sacrifice six figures, and [00:33:00] let's all make $60k 
Shantar Gibson 
Page 10 of 13 
or $50k a year, which is more than reasonable if you're coming from humble means, 
which the majority of people are. 
It's nice if you make six figures or something like that, but it's not necessary. I don't want 
to see any one of my brothers or sisters not being able to feed their family when they 
took the time to go through all of the training, get into the local. They did everything 
that I did, and they deserve to be able to come home with their head held high and take 
care of [00:33:30] their family and well being. Furlough, that's what it represents. If 
three people were constantly fora company, they go out and it allows one person to 
work for six months. Which in six months, they can make more than enough to support 
their family. 
I get to go have a life. Eight weeks off, really? You're never going to find that kind of deal 
just about anywhere in life. If you're good with [00:34:00] yourfinances, you can save 
your money, you should be able to travel the world and just spend time with your 
family. Walk your dog, whatever we're not doing when we're constantly working from 
9:00 to 5:00, Monday through Friday. That's why I think it's a great thing. 
Setare Arashloo: Do you think you will tell your son or daughter, or anyone from your next 
generation who may consult with you, to [00:34:30] become an electrician? 
Shantar: Again, if I saw their aptitude and that's what they really wanted to do, all I hope that I'm 
representing is thinking outside of the box when you choose career paths. Whether they 
decide that they could do electrical, astronaut, engineer, I really want at least the 
females in my family to know, don't be intimidated by mechanical things or 
mathematical things, or even something that looks like it requires a lot of strength or 
large build to accomplish. [00:35:00] You literally can do anything that you set your 
mind to. 
The males in my family, male privilege already exists to a certain degree. Again, I would 
encourage them to do and follow their heart, but if they wanted to be a ballet dancer, I 
would also think that that was courageous. I just wanted to represent pursuing things 
outside of the box. If anybody in my family really showed that kind of interest, and I saw 
an astuteness [00:35:30] or when I have family members help me with projects around 
the house and I see a real excitement, I totally would let my whole family do this. No 
questions asked. I don't think it's that scary. 
Setare Arashloo: Do you ever, or usually customize your tools or tool belt, or some sort of tools 
or materials that you work with on a daily basis? 
Shantar: Yes. I look, a lot of the stuff that I started [00:36:00] to build my stuff off of is the army, 
because they're constantly in combat carrying heavy things, and need to be able to 
retrieve things in a quick manner. A lot of the hunky tools that just have the name 
brands of what the trades use, I found them to not actually work for what we're doing in 
the field. I went out and got an army utility belt, and separate all of my tools so that it's 
more on a quick draw. It's been better for my back and the way I carry the tools. 
Shantar Gibson

I'm always prepared. I don't need [00:36:30] a cart or dropping things when I'm at a high 
altitude or something like that, because I have it all set up on me kind of like Inspector 
Gadget. I took stuff from other elements of life where I see people succeeding with 
carrying things on them at all times, and I applied it there. As opposed to what naturally 
everyone else is doing. 
Setare Arashloo: Cool. Let me ... I think we covered about everything. [00:37:00] I still want to get 
the address of the tattoo shop. 
Shantar: Oh it's closed. 
Setare Arashloo: Oh no. 
Shantar: It's closed, because yeah ... I still tattoo. I just, we separated because her ego took off. I 
didn't foresee that. She didn't stay humble. She tried to make me her employee and I 
was like, "I taught you how to tattoo. How am I your employee?" Her parents came 
from money, so that's how we opened [00:37:30] the shop, but she didn't know how to 
run a shop or be in one. I had to be there and while she worked, she was a graphic 
designer also, she was my doppelganger, she stayed working I would be at the shop all 
day. Then she would take over nights and weekends. It was seamless like that, but then 
she just wanted to hang out and say she had a tattoo shop, and just me sit there and 
give her half. I just was like, "I'm out of here. This is silly." 
Right now, I'm building a studio in my home. I have an extra [00:38:00] big room, but I 
don't want it to just be for tattoos anymore. I want it to be for... I want to paint in 
there. I want to create movies, music, everything that I've always been pursuing now 
that I have the so-called extra cash laying around, I have the ability to build my dream 
studio and ultimately keep moving until I have a space where when artists bring up that 
they want to work on something, I'll be like, "I have a space for this." Being an artist, and 
you're starting out, you don't [00:38:30] have money. You need a sponsor, and- 
Setare Arashloo: Even half way through, you may not. 
Shantar: Half way through, and still at the end, but I like the idea of when I meet young people 
and they have all these skills, I want to have a place to be like, "Hey, I record. Oh you 
want to do a podcast? I already have a green screen set up in the room. Oh you want to 
go on the radio, I have all of the audio equipment sitting here." Because I've made a lot 
of makeshift studios over the years, I know how to put one together [00:39:00] without 
spending an arm and a leg. Then I hope to, the union was always meant to be my 
investor, like a bank. They're investing in me, but I'm not only supposed to stay stagnant 
and just go to work and come home. It's to get back to what I was doing before, but I 
just didn't have the money or means to do so. 
When these all culminate together, hopefully at a good age, when I'm older I don't have 
to do it till my bones are falling apart like [00:39:30] everybody else. I can go off into the 
sunset and continue to pursue what I was already doing before, but now in an older 
matured ... My time passed, I'm almost 40 now, so I'm ready to pass the baton to the

next, young, fresh, enthusiastic person. I'm not greedy and want to be the cool person 
all the way until I'm 70. No, it's someone else's turn, but you want to mentorthat 
energy instead of little, talking down to it. Because I felt like a lot [00:40:00] of older 
artists didn't embrace younger artists when I was in awe of their work. They just scoff at 
it and brush you off, instead of taking you under their wing. 
They're so afraid of you being their peer that they don't really mentor you or nurture 
you to get you to a good space, or help you meet the people. They don't need you to 
steal their zone or their little world. I don't want to be that sort of artist. I want to be 
open, worldly, and make sure that everybody has [00:40:30] a shot at whatever this 
dream is. 
Setare Arashloo: Cool. 
Shantar: Yeah, so the tattoos are still there, it's just I'm building the studio. Every now and again, 
my old clients that I've been doing their whole body, I'll set up for them and I'll keep 
going. I have an album if you ever want to see some of this stuff. 
Setare Arashloo: Nice. 
Shantar: I've met some cool people over the years. I only take pictures of the weird ones though. 
The generic ones, I'm like, "Ugh, another name." They get boringafter a while. 
[00:41:00] Everybody thinks their idea's great, but to me, it's yeah I've done this before. 
You can only do so many stars and hearts, and this and that, but it's not boring it's 
amazing to you. I just love that look on people's face when it's done and it's art, and you 
walk away with it. It's the greatest canvas I've ever found. Yeah. 
Setare Arashloo: Awesome. Great. 
Shantar: Yay. 
Setare Arashloo: Thank- 
How did we do?
