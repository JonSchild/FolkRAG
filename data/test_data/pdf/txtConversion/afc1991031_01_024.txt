I arrive at John Farr’s Arrow Insurance office in Frisco, Colorado, 
at 8:00 am., as planned, along with Eben Stromquist, who has helped 
me to drive here from California. John Farr, the founder of the 
Rocky Fountain Continental Divide Foundation, our host and local 
connection, turns out to be very congenial, informative, and know- 
ledgable about this area. Eventually Rusty, Dr. Howard Marshall, 
Folklife Specialist of the Folklife Center of the Library of Congress, 
joins us and escorts me and Eben 'home' to our field headquarters 
for the next two ’weeks, the Farrs' house near Breckenridge. Rusty 
Stays here and we have a small office in this large, comfortable log 
cabin set between trees. Barbara Orbach, the other intern, arrives 
at noon with John Farr. He takes us two interns to our quarters for 
the duration of the project, a brand new house within a short walking 
distance of the Farrs’ place, rather than the motel I had expected. 
These are ideal conditions; the house is furnished with all the 
essentials (except for curtains, some carpeting and furniture), and 
we have plenty of privacy, even luxury. I move into the upstairs, 
complete with bath and balcony, while Barbara takes the master bed¬ 
room suite downstairs. All this only costs us |10/each per day. 
Once we are settled and have eaten our first lunch in the new house, 
John Farr takes us, the fieldwork team and Eben, in his jeep on an 
orientation tour of the area we are to explore in the next two weeks. 
Again he turns out to be an indefatigable source of information. Much 
of his talk is recorded on a cassette tape by Rusty. John Farr wants 
to establish a high altitude working ranch museum in the Blue River 
Valley area and our project this year is to explore the valley for 
ranching history and to look for possible sites for the museum. The . 
orientation to\ir begins with Dillon Reservoir, then leads into the 
Blue River Valley. On this first day John Farr introduces us to the 
McKee family who now owns the old Johnson place, our first promising 
site, a picturesque conglomeration of old log buildings interspersed 
with modern trailers and cars. We arrange to return the next day for 
an interview with Loma McKee, daughter-in-law of I. W. ('Fa') McKee, 
the head of the family. 
* \ 
Instead of following the Blue River Valley further, we turn east on 
a country road and John Farr shows us the huge AKAX molybdenum mine 
hidden in the mountains. From there we head towards Kremmling, a 
center for ranchers at the north end of the Blue River Valley. Along 
the way we observe irrigation ranching and we get our first view of 
the local technique of haystacking: the hay is raked together with 
outlandish buckrakes and hayrakes, old. trucks that are turned around 
and drive backwards, sporting crude wooden attachments. By means of 
a 'plunger' contraption attached to another truck the small piles of 
hay are then pushed up a wooden ramp to the top of a slide stacker 
made of lodgepine poles that frames the growing haystack.

On the return trip we drive around the Green Mountain Reservoir 
and just past Heeney John Farr points out Karl Knorr's ranch, 
another site with old log buildings for us to investigate. That 
evening Leslie and John Farr invite us, including Eben, for dinner 
at their house. The first day of fieldvjork thus ends pleasantly.

8/19/80 
This morning Barbara and I meet with R\isty in our 'office* and he 
gives us a lesson on how to do logs, tape recordings, photography. 
In the midst of it I get a phonecall from Berkeley: Jed, a close 
friend, has suddenly died of a heart attack. I an deeply shocked, 
but I know I won't quite realize the loss until I am back in Cali¬ 
fornia. Then I get so busy doing fieldwork that only once in a 
while the news flashes through my mind. 
VJe now have John Farr's old jeep to use during the fieldwork period 
and Rusty drives us to Kremmling for more orientation, to do some 
errants, and to have lunch. In the early afternoon we go on to the 
McKee ranch, where Barbara and I interview Loma McKee and later also 
Doris McKee, he3A sister-ln-law who happens to be visiting her. I use 
my Uher tape recorder, but the level indicator hardly moves and I 
assume that the machine is not working right. After the first tape 
(C080-ED-R1), which later turns out to be fine, I switch to my 
cassette recorder. Unfortunately the microphone is not working and 
later nothing on the cassette can be understood. However, we manage 
to fill out the interview forms for both Loma and Doris (see Earbara 
Orbach's notes) and I keep the recorder going for 90 minutes. Then 
Barbara leaves and with no tape running the conversation becomes 
suddenly more personal. I feel that 1 am establishing a rapport, 
especially with Doris, who is close to my age, a lithographer/photo¬ 
grapher who has lived in Mew York, but now seems to prefer to be a 
ranch hand on the family ranch. She invites me to come along while 
she brings in the wood tomorrow and hints that ice may get invited to 
join the family potluck dinner next Friday. By contrast Loma's acti¬ 
vities are centered around her family, her tvro children, and her 
husband Dick's excavation business. She is very friendly and invites 
us for a glass of ice tea before we leave. 
After the interviews and the conversation I join Rusty and Barbara 
who are exploring the old log buildings of the ranch and I shoot my 
first roll of slides (C080-ED-1) on the McKee ranch. V/e announce 
that we will be back next morning, then take off for home and to go 
to the play "The Snowshow Itinerant" in the Father Dyer church in 
Breckenridge. The play is pieced together from episodes out of the 
famous Father Dyer's life, as he crossed the Rockies to preach the 
gospel in mining camps and saloons while carrying the mail along. 
It is performed before a crowded and enthusiastic audience and gives 
me a taste of the local population, their history and legends. 
After the play Barbara and I get another lesson from Rusty: how to use 
the Nagra tape recorder that he has brought along from the Library 
of Congress. We are both somewhat apprehensive and awed to used 
that expensive piece of equipment.

Rusty meets us fairly early in the morning and we 
McKee ranch "before they are quite ready to decide 
job today. Eventually Rusty and Barbara go along 
McKee to observe and interview her while she is doing irrigation 
work. I join Wes Dunaway, a son-in-law of the McKees, who cuts 
wood in a forest across the highway on the road to the hay meadows. 
His daughter Cheri and his niece Phoebe come along, both to play 
and to help him. (see slides C080-ED-2, Nos. 1-32 'and C080-ED-3, 
Nos. 1-6). 
Wes is staying with the McKees only temporarily while he is waiting 
to move his family to Dillon soon (see attached interview report form 
for more details on his background). He is cutting wood for the 
McKees, not for himself. He has stayed on the ranch with his wife 
and two children for nine months and therefore feels obligated to 
help with the ranch work. He learned all his skills from I. W. "Pa" 
McKee. He does not particularly enjoy woodcutting, but considers it 
just something that got to be done. Only dead trees are cut, of 
which there are plenty in the area; they are free for the taking. 
Wes has two small chain saws to cut the trees into about two yard 
long pieces; he then cleans off the biggest branches with the saw. 
His daughter Cheri is expected to help by dragging the pieces to 
the road. I lend a hand when not taking photos. The younger Phoebe, 
daughter of Mary McKee, meanwhile swings from various aspen trees 
that lean closer and closer toward the ground in the process. 
After about an hour Doris drives the truck up to us and brings the saw 
horse. "Big" Vera, Wes' wife, has come along with little Michael, 
their son and everyone's darling, the youngest child on the ranch. 
They promise to come back at 11:30 am to pick up the cut wood and to 
bring us some ice tea. Wes now starts cutting the large pieces into 
handy smaller pieces. Cheri and I help by putting the logs on the 
saw horse and by holding them steady for him. Eventually we hear 
the truck approaching, but it does not make it all the way up to 
where we are this time. We walk down to it and Wes repairs the truck 
so that it can at least be driven back to the ranch. I catch a ride 
with Doris, Vera, and Michael. They decide to pick up another pile 
of wood further down, so that the drive 
not done for nothing. 
have a chance to admire Doris' ability to handle the truck off the 
road between trees; at one point I have to pull in the side mirror 
for us to get through. They load the truck and Big Vera amazes me 
by swinging a heavy cutting block clear over the side of the truck. 
We drive back to the ranch, unload the wood, and just as I get invited 
into the main house for a glass of ice tea, Rusty and Barbara return 
from the irrigation work with "Ma" McKee. Doris seems anxious to know 
If we come back, tells us about the Thursday night square dance and 
about a smith who is coming soon to put new horseshoes on the horses. 
We take off to Kremmling for lunch.

8/20/80 
In Kremmllng I try to contact Olga Hill, the widow of a former 
owner of the valley of the Blue River, Clayton Hill. I try again 
on other occasions, but her phone remains unanswered. We go on to 
the Knorr ranch, where Rusty is met rather coolly by Mrs. Knorr. 
It seems that John Farr has neglected to call them about us. We 
have cone at about the busiest time of the year, during hay-making, 
and according to Mrs. Knorr they will not have any time to talk to 
us. However, we go on to the field where Karl Knorr is working with 
his crew and we have a chance to photograph them raking and stacking 
the hav with their odd machines (see slides C080-ED-3, Eos. 8-^2 and 
C080-ED-4 Nos. 1-20). Karl is a little more congenial than his 
wife, but he really does not have time to talk to us. Mrs. Enders.

On Recording a Building (Asseyor's cabin at Tiger, defunct mining town) 
1 - Take fotos, get a feeling for the place 
Concentrate on form - floorplan/ele-'ratl on/volume (include vertical 
with horizontal measurements) 
Later to be sorted out according to diffusion, ethnic origin 
Log buildings - cornering particularly important 
This cabin: still on original site, but extensively remodeled, re¬ 
worked; was an asseyor's office (stores, public buildings tend to 
have doors on small side, as here - private houses generally have 
doors on long side) it is right on the road, another indication 
for a 'public' building 
The most essential fotos: 3/^ dhot of front side, then diagonal 
and head-on of all walls. 
Rough floor, no foundation, just built on dirt -- not as carefully 
done as 'real' house. 
Pine: soft wood, alpine, cannot be cleaved easily, is notched 
here: saddle-notching (predominant Western tradition, whereas in 
East mostly used for 'scruffy' buildings, outhouses = low grade) 
logs are left round, less neat looking; some logs are 'locked', 
others are not; some have great nails, spikes driven through them, 
Lodgepole pine (predominant tree here) - saddle-notching works fine, 
slightly twisted look 
Chinking -- fine, sandy gravel and wood splits sealed with some 
bonding agent (or adobe if that not available, but really the 
elevation is too high for adobe -- it does not work well here) 
- One log on front is squared—perhaps it was planned to be sided 
originally (but: logs stick out too much, would be a lot of trouble 
to do) 
- Building is built right on to the ground, no foundation - another 
indication that building is not very Important; bottom members are 
sills (4 principle members on which the building rests) 
S fhe 
- Plates: (on top ofAbearing walls that carry the building, support 
either- the next -floor-or the roof)- here plates have been squ ared, 
flattened on 3 sides; 
- Tools to flatten log: felling axe and broad axe; ewi. -to 
ls_£ step: stand on new log and make chalk line straight^acr-os-s (use 
string, tighten and snap, several people working on either end) 
2nd step: Chop log with felling axe diagonally deep enough to meet 
line = scoring, leaves series of wood chips at intervals 
3rd step: with broad axe (sharp on one side only) go along line: 
peels of the wood chips; flatten 3 sides only-- bottom not necessary^

- Plate has to hold rafters, easier to set rafters on flat surface, 
saves time and is more efficient, besides being more traditional. 
- Rafters are sawed straight across, tailing sticking through, toe- 
nailed right through rafter into plate; about 2' apart 
- Sills are often hewn, too? ^ 4»p hs 
- Floor joist = principal member supporting floor, between sill and 
next log 
- Rafter couples are butted f^us.h^at the peak (imp. - indicates a*S* 
English origin), stabilized by^cBliar beams (1x6 boards - only 
higher ones are original, others are 'junk' nailed up later) 
- Pine log joist hewn flat on top only (to nail in florr boards), 
rough circle sawn lumber, random size floor boards 
- Sub-floor has wide 1x8 boards (fancier house would have smaller 
boards that more likely would be joined together by tongue and groove) 
some of upper floor has tongue and groove, later addition, typical 
mining camp 'upgrading' (junk all thrown together) 
- Front room was probably reception; second room probably a little 
nicer with l/2"x 5 1/2M tongue in groove pine floor 
- Decking = l"x5 1/2" about 2" gaps, deckirig nailed to rafters; 
shingles on top now replaced with asphalt 
- originally only basic log walls, everything else came later; ps- 
titlons - perhaps 2 doors in the middle of building, looks like a 
3-room house; perhaps upstairs was floored

still being made now. (it—Mo 
- celling joist in second room — probably original’, supported attic; 
front room may or may not have had ceiling. 
- Second room window--maybe ride-in window? (strange shape) 
- Back-end added later, but not too much later 
- Entrance at bottom of drawing (be consistent - always keep this 
the same)^ JLr<v-p kJ

8/21/80 
P. 1 
In the morning we visit the museum of the Summit County Historical 
Society at Dillon. The outside artifacts, old farming equipment, 
a pipeline, fire truck, and a horse carriage, are interesting (see 
slides C030-ED-5. Nos. 21-30). We record Iuiia Myer's cabin in detail, 
which is still in the process of being restored to become part of the 
museum (see slides CO8O-ED-6, Nos. 1-16). Later I find details on 
this cabin in the museum displays: the last permanent resident of the 
cabin was Lula Osburn Myers, IS8I-I973, who came from Elizabeth, 
Colorado, to Frisco in 1908 to teach there. The cabin was built in 
1885 and its original location was near the Ski Tip Ranch. It once 
served as a stage stop between the towns of Keystone and Montezuma. 
The house was donated to the Summit Historical Society, which is now 
trying to restore it to its I8R5 condition. The house has no fireplace 
(the chimney was for the stove); the walls are still covered with 
newspapers. It is a ho\ise type transplanted from the East, as found 
earlier in Tidewater Virginia or in Maryland. Details of this house 
are: 'two full stories, conceived on the ancient English 16* bay basic 
building block; it was probably sided originally (the pine logs are 
hewn flat); the joints at the corners are square notched, the logs 
are chinked with wet mud and covered with tin; tow-nails are driven 
through the corners' that are not locking (earlier pegs would be used). 
The house was moved complete on a truck to the museum site. Next the 
Summit Historical Society also plans to move the assayor's cabin from 
Tiger to the museum. 
We spend some time inside the museum and find it immediately too 
crowded, too jumbled, although there is much nice material (see slides 
C080-ED-6, Nos. 17-21). The rather aloof curator (?) Rebecca Va-ughn W&u 
does not volunteer to explain the artifacts, or claims not to know 
about them. My previous experience with small folklife museums proved 
that it is essential to have a good, enthusiastic interpreter to make 
the local history come alive. This museum should improve once the 
other buildings are finished and the materials can be spread out and 
be organized better. 
Next we visit the "Junktique" in Frisco, a thrift store that sells 
old clothes, tools, curiosities. Barbara and I get presents for Rusty's 
birthday, which is today. This store, another old log building, is 
destined to soon become a historical landmark. 
Back at the Farrs' house for lunch we start some sorting, logging of 
artifacts. Barbara and I get the afternoon off and I am glad to have 
time to rest and read. Later we have dinner and a small birthday 
celebration for Rusty at the Farrs' house. Then we go off to the 
square dance practice of the Summit County 4 Squares at the Slate Creek 
Community Hall, where I. W. McKee is calling (see slides COBO-ED-6, 
Nos. 22-37 and C080-ED-7, Nos. 1-21). Five couples come to the practice 
and one single woman, Florence, who is very happy to have Rusty for 
her partner. The couples Include VJes and Vera Dunaway, who are by

the tape recording; \je are made to join the dance once. Vera "Ma" 
McKee comes later In the evening, possibly in our honor, and I take 
family pictures of the McKee dancers. We stay until 900 pm, 
although the practice goes on until 11:00 pm.

Early in the morning all three of us record the remaining log 
buildings on the McKee ranch, barn No. 3 (slides C080-ED-9, 
Nos. 18-28 and C080-ED-10, Nos. 1-14), the remains of building 
No. 4 across the road from the main ranch buildings (slides 
C080-ED-10, Nos. 15-29). and the shed, log building No. 6 
(slides C080-ED-10, Nos. 32-36 and C080-ED-11, Nos. 1-8). Rusty 
measures and draws the buildings, Barbara takes black and white 
photos, I take color slides. 
All morning Barbara is bleeding from a small cut on her leg. 
Because of the high altitude the blood does not coagulate and 
eventually we take her to Frisco to the pharmacist and rotarian 
Bo Bogan, a somewhat eccentric character in his seventies. He 
treats us to a fascinating talk on high-altitude medicine while 
curing Barbara’s problem with a free sample of iron ^sulfate.  V 
Moreover he gives us his own dietary advice on how to counteract 
the effects on the human body of sudden change from low to high 
altitude and he particularly advises Barbara not to be a vegetarian 
under these circumstances. According to Bo one should not eat 
protein before such a sudden change in altitude. His ideas, how¬ 
ever, are not printed and distributed widely in the area because 
they ’may hurt business* ; skiers and tourists may avoid short 
vacations in the high altitude resorts if they become aware of 
the bad side effects of sudden transfer into high altitude. Eo 
is a great source of information and we hope to have a chance to 
interview him at a later time. 
We have lunch at the Farrs' house and leave Barbara there to relax. 
It is raining and Rusty and I take off to the Knorr ranch again 
with the hope that they have stopped haymaking for once because 
of the rain. But it rains everywhere else except on their meadow 
and the work goes on as usual. By now they have gotten used to 
us and are friendlier than before. Karl Knorr points out a small 
cedar that grows out of a rock on the meadow and mentions that he 
has always wanted to take photos of this tree; I take a few photos 
with my camera for him. Eoth Karl and George Knorr stop their work 
to Identify the different grasses in their hay for us (slides 
C080-ED-11, Nos. 9-1?)• Brom, Timothy, Clover, and Blue grass are 
described as the ’real good stuff’, everything else is useless weed. 
Karl identifies the small bushes with yellow flowers that are 
common in most of the meadows as 'cinque foyl' or potent tiller. 
I fjnd that a good part of the hay in this meadow consists of weeds 
rather than the desirable grasses that the ranchers at one time or 
another may seed on the meadows. 
On the way back Rusty and I stop to record the small graveyard at 
the south end of Green Mountain Reservoir near the Colorado and 
Heeney roads junction, inspired by James Deetz' study of cemetery 
8/23/BO 
p. 2 
art In New England of the 18th and 19th centuries. This cemetery 
dates from 1902 to 1931 and does not compare favorably with the 
earlier folk art on the East Coast; it's gravestones are small and 
plain and do not show muchreligjous or artistic inspiration. 
Barbara meanwhile has recovered and we have supper with her in 
Breckenridge. Later we try to dub the ' Ka' McKee interview on 
irrigation from the reel tape to several cassettes, but it does 
not work. Finally we decide that taking notes of the original 
tape is good enough and we do not need dubs of this interview. -

Barbara and I have the morning off, time to start organizing 
and typing the material. It rains heavily off and on. In the 
afternoon Rusty, Barbara and I visit the Callahans, neighbors 
of the McKees up on the hill above the ranch. Rusty arranged 
this visit because Mr. Callahan had mentioned that he once 
played country music in a well-known California band. He had 
not played music for years because his wife objected to it. 
But this afternoon vie get him to bring out his guitar, later 
his banjo, and he remembers some of his music again as he starts 
playing and singing. A few times Rusty joins in. Barbara and 
I manage to use the Nagra tape recorder successfully on our own 
as we record the music (tape COSO-BO/ED-R1). 
In the evening Rusty visits us, the interns, for a talking sesslo 
We assess the progress of the fieldwork and our feelings about it 
Rusty brings me a rare treat, antelope meat that the Farrs had 
prepared for dinner.

8/25/80 
Our morning starts with a flat tire that Leslie Farr points out 
to us just after we take off. We are really putting a lot of 
miles on the old jeep, and all the tires have suffered. We leave 
Barbara in Breckenridge to explore the town and to look for court 
records and other historical-statistical material. Rusty and I 
go on to the McKees once more to record the log buildings Nos. 
5A, 5B, and 5C (see attached drawings). When we arrive I ask 
Mary McKee if we may have access to the interior of the main house 
later, and she says that will be fine. But later, when we knock 
at the door again, 'Ma' McKee is less friendly; she is just about 
to do her laundry and does not want us in there. It seems that 
we have overstayed our welcome, especially when Mary fells me out¬ 
side that 'Ma' feels her privacy is being invaded. Rusty and I 
now feel quite uncomfortable and leave for the Knorr ranch. 
We arrive just vrhen Karl, Greg and Mrs. Knorr finish their lunch, 
a full hot meal as one finds it in Germany, not just sandwiches. 
We are invited to join them for coffee and brownies, or rather 
* fannies' as Mrs. Knorr calls them. They remind me of my mother's 
Christmas cookies back in Germany. I get the recipe from Mrs. Knorr 
and I promise to send her my mother's recipe, also to send her some 
of the cookies I make every year around Christmas time. We have 
a friendly conversation. 
We arrange to cone 
again that evening for a tape recording session with Karl Knorr. 
We also get permission to visit the "Old Dave Doig Place", property 
of the Knorrs, an old log cabin that I had noticed before from the 
Heeney road on their \ipper hay meadow at the edge of the forest. 
According to the Knorrs, Dave Doig's first building burned down. 
The present log cabin was probably built around 1915* Dave Doig 
died quite a few years ago. The cabin was sold to Karl Knorr before 
Dave died, but Dave continued to live there until his death. It 
has been vacant now for about 15 to 18 years. Dave Doig's three 
children are still alive, all between 70 and 75 years old, but tney 
do not live around here. There is a spring nearby, but no electri¬ 
city. 
When Rusty and I get to the Dave Doig cabin, two of the ranch hands, 
father and son Fulllan, are just cutting the grass on that meadow 
(slides CO8O-ED-II, Nos. 29-31). I draw and measure most of the 
building, with Rusty supervising and adding details. We are both 
excited about this find, a two-story I-house, two rooms to each 
floor, and I want It for the museum, if not for myself. One of 
the upstairs rooms is patched up enough so that the roof is water¬ 
tight and it seems that occasionally somebody stays there overnight. 
We take along one strange contraption, a piece of wire.mesh attached 
to a wooden handle, the use of which we cannot guess. Karl Knorr 
8/25/80 
p. 2 
later Identifies it as a homemade fly swatter. 
We go home to meet Barbara, to eat, and to relax. By dark we 
return to the Knorrs. With Rusty conducting the interview, Karl 
Knorr talks for hours until we have four tapes filled (C080-HM- 
Rl, 2, 3, 4). At the end Mrs. Knorr provides coffee and snacks. 
Their marriage reminds me of the familiar plot of a Western moviei 
Mrs. Knorr came to Heeney as the *schoolmarra' before she married 
the rancher. Before we leave they show us their game room, and I 
suddenly realize that these * simple ranchers’ whom I thought I knew 
from the interviews and. from observing their work in the hay meadows 
lead a double life: they have.game trophies from Africa and Alaska. 
Apparently they are used to travel during the winter season, when 
there is not much work to be done and they are making plans to visit 
one of their daughters who is now living in Alaska. We arrange to 
come back the next day to look at the log house and the furniture 
which Mrs. Knorr promises to show us, a remnant of the original ranch 
that was moved to its present position across the street from the 
Knorr*s main house, along with the log building rented by the Enders, 
when the Green Mountain reservoir was created in the early 40s and 
flooded the original Knorr ranch.

Notes on talks and interview with Karl Knorr 
Karl has about four slide stackers on his ranch to build haystacks; 
all are homemade of lodgepine poles; they are between 5 and 7 years 
old. The ramp angle is 45°; after the first few loads of hay, the 
"buck heaps" as he calls them, are pushed in by the buck rakes 
directly from the back,the "back stop" is put in place and stacking 
begins by "plunger truck" that pushes the "buck heaps" up the ramp. 
Eventually George Knorr climbs on top of the haystack to distribute 
the hay evenly. It takes between 1 and 2 hours to fill one haystack. 
When finished, the side gates ("wings") are folded up and the slide 
stacker is moved to the next meadow, pulled by a tractor. 
Karl knows three terms for the rakes: the original term was "bull 
rake", the most common term now is "buck rake", and another term is 
"sweep rake". He and his father Wilhelm built the first one in this 
valley in 1935 using the chassis and the engine of a 1923 Dodge car. 
The buck rake driven by Mrs. Enders may have been an old ambulance 
from or before WorldWar II. It is driven backwards. 
When commenting on log buildings, Karl called saddle notching 
"saddle and rider", square notching "flat dovetail - they don't hold 
together, you have to nail them". His uncle was a skilled "logman" 
who could dovetail in such a way that the logs locked together with¬ 
out needing nails. 
The original Knorr Ranch was on the site of the present Green Mountain 
Reservoir. Some of the log buildings built by his father and grand¬ 
father (Guyselman, his mother's father) were saved and moved to their 
present location on logs and sleds in the winter of 1942/43, before 
the reservoir was created. 
The ranch now has about 300 cows. Beginning June 1st they are grazed 
on Forest Service Land, the V/illian River Mountain (nicknamed Blue 
Ridge Allotment); the cattle drive is about 6 miles long around the 
dam and the cows get there within a day. Before and after the grazing 
when the cows are gathered again in the fall, they spend a few days 
of transition in a cow camp, a fenced-in area of about 40 acres. 
In this country nobody stays out with the cows, except maybe for fun. 
The Knorr Bros, brands are: 
Lazy Kover, Lazy W 
dating about 1900 
by William Knorr 
Flying Diamond 
dating about 1940 
Other ranch work consists of irrigation beginning in Hay, when the 
snow is gone, to raise a hay crop. The oldest water rights go back 
to about 1880 and they have plenty of x-fater here, nice big creeks 
from the mountains: Catarac, 0+?ter, Black Creek. His father built 
some ditches, others were even built before.

Notes on talks and interview with Karl Knorr 
The land is all glacier moraine, full of rocks, and the rule is, 
according to Karl: "Hay what you can, miss what’s too tough," 
The meadows are indeed full of snail islands of tall grass hiding 
rocky areas that are avoided "by the hay crews. 
V/hen asked about the possibility to stop haymaking because of rain, 
Karl commented: "It's like old Ben Franklin used to say, 'Make hay 
when the sun shines', and I've found no better substitute." 
Much hay has to be raised to feed the cattle for six months during 
the severe winter here in the high Rockies. Karl does not do much 
work besides feeding the cattle every day during the winter, except 
to go over the machinery. Eut in the spring all the jobs happen at 
once, the fences have to be mended where elk has gone through, 
meadows have to be irrigated and the new calfs are branded in May 
before going out to graze. 
Eranding is now done by propane torch, rather than using a wood fire 
At the same time his calfs are earmarked and a double serum is 
administered against malignant edema and black leg. The male calfs 
are castrated with a short blade knife. The testicles are collected 
and later cooked and eater, as "Rocky Mountain oysters". Additionally 
the calfs are de-horned by applying a paste. 
Karl's father immigrated to the area to avoid military service in 
Germany. Because of my German background, he brought out the photo 
of a distant German relative, a young woman named 'Elke' who had 
written to him in an effort to keep contact; an older photo from 
Germany, dating about 1930, shows the family of his father's brother 
August Knftrr, at Riederkapp, Germany. He seemed interested in his 
German background, but apparently has never made an effort to visit 
Germany or to meet his relatives there.

We attend the Rotarian breakfast meeting, Rusty to give a speech 
on our fieldwork project and Barbara and I to record it, I use 
my Uher tape recorder and realize only afterwards th^t something 
went wrong and nothing got recorded at all. We certainly have had 
our share in technical problems! However, we recall and discuss the 
speech later. Rusty introduced the idea of establishing a ranching 
museum in the Blue River Valley, as he had done previously at an¬ 
other Rotarian meeting here. He explained what we had achieved 
during the last week.and why vie focus on ranching rather than on 
mining (which has been done already). He cited other museums which 
operate along this line and emphasized that this short fieldwork 
period can only be the first step, that there is much more left to 
do. The time slot that the museum will represent is still open to 
discussion; it will probably be between 1920 and 19^0, but suggestions 
are welcome. The museum should be run by a ’real* working ranch 
family, not just by students on their simmer vacations. The period 
will represent the second generation of settlers in this area, the 
ranchers, and it is so close to the present that some people will 
still remember it. But there will also be 'old grandpa*, the pioneer, 
who is still working his placer mine up on the hill. Rusty stressed 
that we need a good, suitable piece of land, and that a museum can 
be a tax shelter. The rotarians, many of whom were younger than I 
would have expected, seemed receptive and interested and asked several 
questions. Robin Theobald in particular inquired about the mining 
aspects of the museum; his family owns the (closed) museum in Brecken- 
ridge and he seemed to be willing to cooperate once the museum will 
be established, especially since he also owns a mine. 
Back at the Farrs house Barbara and I do our laundry and more paperwork 
I start logging the artifacts, mostly nails we have collected from 
various log buildings. In the afternoon we drive to the Knorr ranch 
and Mrs. Knorr opens the old log building across the street for us, 
which she has turned into an antique shop (slides C0B0-ED-12, Nos. 1-6) 
About 80/ of the items originally belonged to the Knorr family and 
she is selling them so that the money can be divided equally between 
the Knorr heirs. Some of the better items, however, are marked 'not 
for sale* and she keeps them for her own daughters. Mrs. Knorr plans 
to auction the whole lot off in September, since the shop is too much 
trouble and, the Enders have complained about being disturbed by po¬ 
tential customers knocking at their door. I have to restrain myself 
from buying any of the items, but I know that I have not much money 
and no room in the car to take anything home. Barbara and I record 
the upstairs, Rusty draws the downstairs rooms. The house closely 
resembles Dave Doig's cabin that we recorded yesterday. 
As we head back home we stop at Slate Creek again, where I had tried 
to find Charlie Lund earlier but found the place deserted. Mow I 
meet Pauline, the young blonde housekeeper, who tells me that he has 
8/26/BO 
p. 2 
gone to the raovies this evening. I leave our card and a brochure 
and tell Pauline that we will be back the next morning before Charlie 
goes out to do his haying. 
In Frisco we have a salad supper at the Pizza Hut. Rusty draws 
•souvenir pictures' for both of us--the feeling is strong that this 
fieldwork is drawing close to its end. My picture is a map of the 
U.S. with Bloomington looming large; we have talked a lot abo\it 
where I should go on for my Ph.D. in Folklore and this is his first 
choice, with Austin ('Austin Island') in second place, Philadelphia 
a problematic third choice. After supper we spend some time in the 
rather nice library at Frisco. The books on Summit County that I am 
looking for are much in demand and many are lent out at this time. 
Fieldnotes C080-ED p. 1 
8/27/80 
We get to Slate Creek in the morning in time to meet Charlie Lund 
before he takes off to the hay meadows. Barbara and Rusty go on to 
record the Knorr ranch buildings, while I stay to interview Charlie 
and his housemates and to record the ranch buildings. Charlie was 
born on the island of Bornholm in Denmark, which is of special interest 
for me (I grew up in Northern Germany close to the Danish border). 
However, his family brought him here at the young age of two and he 
does not seem to remember anything peculiarly Danish He is 79 years 
old, looks like an old hobo and mumbles, so that I can hardly under¬ 
stand him. Later I get more information on him from Pauline and 
Cheri, two pretty young women who live on his ranch and seem to take 
care of the house work and the cooking. 
Charlie is the last surviving member of his family. Fauline Ballard, 
the young blonde woman, arrived here in December of 1977 to take care 
of his last remaining sister Esther, who was then dying of cancer. 
Pauline originally comes from Massachusetts; she found out about this 
job from friends and she came here as to ’the land of opportunities', 
working as a nurse and as a cook. After Esther died, she simply 
stayed on and now she lives in the old schoolhouse. This particular 
morning she was busy baking cookies and pies; later on she helped with 
the haying and in the afternoon she was riding one of the horses. 
Cheri Welden, the brunette woman, came here from Iowa in May 1979, 
to substitute for Pauline who was on vacation. She simply got 
'addicted' to the life on Charlie Lund's ranch and stayed on. She 
now occupies the old milk shed, one of the log buildings. This 
morning she is spinning wool and dying wool in big enamel pots 
that are boiling on the kitchen stove. Charlie Lund looks on 
seemingly pleased. 
I follow Charlie Lund around as he is feeding the chickens and the 
pigs (slides C080-ED-12, Los. 8-23). The pigs apparently are Pauline's 
idea. Charlie teeters back and forth while climbing over the fence 
into the pigsty so that I get scared he may fall, but he manages 
quite nicely and eventually he drives off to the hay meadow on his 
tractor. 
Pauline, Cheri, and a number of their friends that show up on the ranch 
during the day are quite friendly. I thoroughly enjoy ray first 'own' 
project during this internship as I photograph, measure and draw the 
ranch buildings (see attached drawings and slides C080-ED-12, Nos. 
24-32 and C080-ED-13, Nos. 1-32). AH the buildings, except for the 
already established old homestead, were built by the Lund family 
after 1913. I do not recognize any particular Danish Influence, they 
seem to just have copied what everyone else had already built in the 
area. Moreover, it is a fairly isolated site with few new buildings 
8/27/80 
i p. 2 
to disturb the original setting. There is the old schoolhouse and 
the teachery, and the community hall where I. W. McKee calls at the 
square dance practice on Thursday nights. All together, for me this 
is the ideal site for our museum, 800 acres complete with the old 
homestead, milk house, ice house, tool shed full of old tools, even old 
skis, cow barns and horse barn, shutes, old fences, horse sled, and 
other ranching equipment. All this belongs to Charlie Lund, an old- 
timer with no apparent heir. It is food for thought, to say the least . 
Rusty and Barbara arrive early in the afternoon and help me to finish 
recording the buildings. For once we get home fairly early.

The morning is spent writing and sorting through our materials. 
Later we get together with Rusty to decide who will write and 
send courtesy prints of our photos to whom. Then we meet once more 
with John Farr, who has been very busy and spent little time with 
us during the fieldwork period. He takes us on another jeep tour, 
this time on a rough trail to a deserted mining town, Rexford, and 
to the top of Wise Mountain. Barbara Interviews him in detail while 
he is driving. 
At Rexford we look at the ruin of a mill and we measure and record 
a former mule stable (slides C080-ED-14, Ros. 1-1?). More mining 
holes occur all over the mountain, up to the very top of it (slides 
C080-ED-14, Eos. 18-30). 
Vie return to the Farrs' house for a good-bye dinner. I call Charlie 
Lund and am glad that he agrees to be interviewed this evening. 
Rusty, Barbara, and I arrive at the Slate Creek ranch when Charlie 
Lund is still sitting at the supper table eating trout with Cheri and 
two young men. Meanwhile we set up the Kagra equipment in his living 
room that looks like it is rarely used. Eventually he joins us and 
I interview him (slides C080-ED-15, Nos. 1-10). I complete the inter¬ 
view form I had started on the previous morning and I ask him mostly 
about things that I had already learned from Pauline and Cheri. His 
short, precise answers fill just about one tape. Except for the 
•Luchtfisk', a special fish dinner eaten at Christmas time made from 
dry fish bought at Denver, he does not recall any typical customs 
from Scandinavia that his family nay have preserved. Again, we wonder 
about the live-in situation at his ranch. Rusty feels that 
all these 'hippies' ha^e taken over the place for possibly less than 
altruistic reasons’, whereas I feel that Charlie Lund rather enjoys 
their company and that they treat him nicely.

Summary - Charlie Lund Interview 
Charlie's family came to Breckenridge in 1904 to join a maternal 
uncle who had immigrated earlier. At first Charlie's father helped 
his uncle to work in timber, until they could get a homestead. 
Their first homestead held 160 acres and it joins the present ranch 
on the uphill side. In the beginning they had a few cows, some hay, 
chickens, and pigs. 
His father died in 1912; Charlie worked the ranch together with his 
two brothers, and his mother. In 1918 they acquired 
the present ranch, which now comprises aboiit 800 acres. At one time, 
for about fifteen years from the 1930s to about 1940, they kept 
1,000 head of sheep; this was more work than cattle and people had 
to come in to do the shearing. The sheep eventually were sold 
because they created too much work. 
Mow the ranch has about one hundred head of Kerford cattle, the 
brand is the reversed L Bar, JL, without other markings. Through 
the 1930s they also kept 18 Holstein milk cows. The old milk shed 
and the old icebox still exist. The cream was sold to Denver in 
10-gallon cans which were picked up by the stage driver whenever 
they were full. 
There were quite a few Scandinavian homesteadsaround Slate Creek, 
many were just 160 acres; but now there are less people and larger 
ranches. Arvid and Hermann Christensen lived across the road, but *- 
later they moved to Krenmling. Charlie's mother, who died in 1926, 
talked Swedish, but the children never did. V.hen Charlie went to 
school in the old schoolhouse where Pauline lives now, the population 
of Slate Creek was fairly big and up to 30 children attended school. 
The only Scandinavian custom Charlie remembers is the special 
"Luchtfisk" dinner celebrated around Christmas time, consisting of 
a type of dry fish that can be bought in Denver. In the summertime 
preachers came to hold service in the schoolhouse a few times. 
There were local dances, music provided by fiddlers and piano 
players. The Community Hall was built around 1937 toy 0CC boys. 
In the 1940s 300-400 acres of the ranch were sold. For ten years 
they ran a dude ranch for a few guests, often the same people came 
back every year. Somebody ran it for them, using cabins across from 
the main ranch. Charlie now still has six horses, two of them a 
team of Belgian work horses. He uses them In the winter to bring 
hay on sleds to feed the cows. 
The ranch was always a family operation with the addition of one 
or more ranch hands. Charlie now has one ranch hand, besides Pauline 
abd Cheri. In the winter he just feeds the cattle. He is semi- 
retired and travels In the winter,he gets out more often and he 
sees Arvid Christensen in Kremmling quite regularly, sonetines goes 
to Denver. He is now planning a trip to Perii.

Summary - Charlie Lund Interview 
Charlie learned the local method of haying by means of a stacker 
and plunger from the other people around here. All log buildings 
other than the old homestead were built by Charlie and his brothers; 
his sister helped design the buildings. They used lodgepole pines,’ 
axe, and saw. The corners are overlapped, he does not know what 
that is called. They pulled the logs up with horses and a pulley, 
tied a rope to the far end of the log and get the horse to pull. * 
The old homestead was moved to its present location by jacks, when 
the present main house was built. 
The water rights date from the 1890s, they came with the place and are 
on record in Breckenridge; Slate Creek and Boulder Creek run on 
the property; they have to irrigate, dig ditches. In the winter ice 
was cut with an ice saw into about 501bs. blocks from the pond and 
the creek here; they were transported by sled and horses to the ice 
house and covered with saw dust. Charlie used to go downhill skiing 
every Sunday during the winter, but he never made his own skis. 
They switched to gasoline tractors long time ago, but he does not 
remember when; the telephone also arrived long time ago. Electricity 
was installed around 19^5 or 1950. He still has many old tools, the 
ice saw and a cant hook, but never uses them any more.

8/29/BO 
On our last day of fieldwork Rusty takes us on our longest drive, 
past Kremmling to the Rocky Mountain Rational Park, Here Barbara and 
I are sent off to critique the so-called 'working ranch' museum of 
Holzwarth (slides COBO-ED-15. Nos. 11-25). A friendly ranger in 
jeans and flowery shirt, cowboy hat offers us freshly baked sour¬ 
dough bread in the original Holzwarth kitchen. Here we also sniff 
some dandelion wine, the recipe of which is available to be copied. 
Additionally to the main hoxise, some dude ranch style guest cabins 
and a taxidermist shop can be visited. Five people (four rangers, 
two of whom are women, and a student from Indiana) run the ranch 
and demonstrate such activities as rug-making, soap-making, bread 
baking, wood cutting, and doing taxidermist work. Chickens, goats, 
and pigs are borrowed from neighbors. The whole project is run on 
very low funds and a lot depends on the initiative of the staff. 
Obviously the emphasis of this park is more/^the natural than on the 
cultural aspects of the area. Rusty personally remembers the Holz- 
warth place from his younger days and tells us that it once was a 
beautiful ranch. All the nex^er buildings were leveled when the 
place was incorporated into the park and the remaining quaint old 
buildings make a somewhat incomplete ranch, he record our critique 
on tape as we drive on. We agree that this is not really a 'working 
ranch' because it does not demonstrate the normal daily activities 
on a ranch. 
Our next stop is at Grand Lake, where Rusty shows us the cabin his 
grandparents built. He spent summers of his childhood, here and is 
obviously very much attached to the place (hence his special interest 
in the Rocky Mountain area). We have lunch and buy a good-bye present 
for John Farr at the little town of Grand Lake; gradually we are 
getting into a farewell mood. 
Next we visit the Grand County museum at Hot Sulphur Springs (slides 
COBO-ED-15, Nos. 26-33). Compared to the one in Summit County, this 
museum is much better organized. It is more spacious and has a 
particularly good section on skis. In addition to the historic 
material it has a special exhibition of a photography contest, thus 
drawing local people to visit the museum repeatedly. 
Back In Frisco we say good-bye to Bo Bogan. VJe do not go back to 
the McKee ranch, but"I call Dick and Loma to thank them and the rest 
of their family for their cooperation. Eben has returned from his 
climbing trip with my car, and I am relieved. In the evening Rusty, 
Barbara and I present gifts to the Farrs, including an artifact 
made of the defective piece of hose from the jeep. Once more we try 
to dub tapes, but again it does not work. Barbara and I listen to 
the most important tapes and make notes for ourselves. Rusty promises 
to make dubs for us in Washington.

In the morning- we pack up and clean the house, then.we take 
our leave from Rusty and the Farrs. Barbara joins me and Eben 
on our drive back to California. It is the end of a good and 
very enjoyable fieldwork experience. I hope to come back for 
more work on the Blue River Valley working ranch museum project 
in the next years.

C080 Fieldwork Evaluation 
Although two weeks are a very short time to do any kind 
of fieldwork, I came home from the Colorado project feeling that 
I had gained much valuable practical experience, I was particularly 
pleased to participate in the very beginning of a long-term project 
aimed at establishing an outdoor museum. Ever since I have 
visited some of the fine folkllfe museums in Denmark, Germany and 
Great Britain, this type of museum has been one of my areas of 
special Interest in the field of folklife studies. Therefore I 
consider the Colorado project a great learning opportunity and I 
hope to continue working on this project. 
Our small team consisting of Dr, Howard Marshall (Rusty) and 
two Interns, Barbara Orbach and I, with the occasional addition of 
John Farr, the dynamic local coordinator and founder of the Rocky 
Mountain Continental Divide Foundation, proved to be very compatible. 
We were exceptionally well provided for with John Farr generously 
offering us hospitality, office space and a jeep for our trans¬ 
portation. Thanks to his efforts Barbara and I were put up in a 
luxurious,, brand new house, affording us ample space and privacy. 
These were ideal fieldwork conditions. 
The almost constant attention given us interns by Rusty Marshall 
and the chance to learn by observing his fieldwork techniques were 
worth many classroom hours. This kind of practical training is 
not available to folklore students at U.C, Berkeley, where no 
fieldwork courses are taught in folklore. The teaching method 
C080-ED 
Fieldwork Evaluation 2 
by example, be it drawing, measuring and analyzing log buildings, 
or interviewing ranchers, or using the fine Nagra tape recorder, 
was a very effective method for me, as I first observed Rusty and 
then tried the newly learned skills myself. No classroom in¬ 
struction can equal the experience of being in the field, dealing 
with 'real* people and making decisions from day to day, particu¬ 
larly in a situation such as ours when it was necessary to squeeze 
as much research as possible into a short two weeks. 
This short time allowed for was the worst problem I encountered 
during the project. By the time we had established some rapport 
with three ranchers and their families, and by the time I had begun 
to feel confident using the equipment and applying the newly ac¬ 
quired skills, the fieldwork period was over. 
During these two weeks our efforts were concentrated on re¬ 
cording the ranching history and documenting old log buildings in 
the Blue River Valley area. We looked at three particular ranches 
in detail. Our first object of study, the McKee ranch, had only 
recently been acquired by the McKee family. During this summer the 
family included I. W. (’Pa') McKee and his wife Vera ('Ma*), their 
son Dick with his wife Loma, their daughters Mary and Doris, their 
daughter 'Big Vera' with her husband Wes Dunaway, together with a 
motley assortment of children. 'Ma' McKee enjoys the life on the 
ranch, especially the irrigation work; Doris, a lithographer and a 
refugee from the city, prefers to be a ranch hand at the present; 
C080-ED 
Fieldwork Evaluation 
Wes Dunaway, if given a choice, would rather be a rancher. How¬ 
ever, because of the small size of their land, the family has to 
rely on Income from outside business, such as provided by *Pa' McKee 
driving a- truck, Dick and Loma running an excavation business, 
Wes working at the AKAX mine. Accordingly, the old log buildings 
on the McKee ranch, our focus of interest, are either in picturesque 
disrepair (except for the main house) or are put to alternate use 
rather than housing the cows, pigs, chickens, grains of a working 
ranch. The trucks, cars and trailers parked in-between the old log 
buildings are more important to the economic survival of the McKees 
than the old log barns inherited from a former owner of the ranch. 
Observing them at their daily routines, breaking the ice when 
I went along wood-cutting, I grew fond of the McKees. For a short 
period we became a fixture of their daily lives as they good- 
naturedly allowed us to scramble around the ranch, taking photos 
and recording the log buildings, collecting their life histories. 
The friendly rapport was increased when we joined the square dance 
practice of the Summit County 4 Squares with *Pa' McKee calling. 
Quite the same happened at the Knorr ranch. Although we In¬ 
truded upon them at the busiest time of the haying season, Karl and 
George Knorr, George’s grandson Greg and Mrs. Enders grew increasingly 
friendly and talkative with each of our successive visits to the

ranch along the Green Mountain Reservoir belongs to oldtimers. 
The Knorr family has owned the ranch since the late 19th century. 
The site of the old log buildings was shifted to their present 
location in 1942, before the Green Mountain Reservoir was created 
and flooded the original homestead. The ranch is operated by the 
brothers Karl and George, both oldtimers in their sixties. Young 
Greg worked the hay for a very specific reason only: to pay off his 
new truck. At this time of his life he does not seem interested 
to work on the ranch permanently. By contrast Mrs. (Karl) Knorr, 
who came to teach school in Heeney and subsequently married the 
rancher, thus following the plot of many formulaic Western novels 
and movies, meanwhile has become an eminently efficient housewife, 
ranch hand, gardener, hunter, mechanic, owner of an antique shop, 
perfectly adapted to the old and new requirements of life on a 
ranch in the Blue River Valley. 
Toward the end of the fieldwork period jure-*-contacted another 
one of the few oldtime ranchers left in the area and found a very 
different situation again at Charlie Lund’s ranch at Slate Creek. 
Born in Denmark, Charlie came to this country with his family at 
the young age of two. The present ranch was purchased by the Lund 
family in 1918 and all the log buildings, except for a cabin that 
came with the land, were built by the family. Though not as old as 
the Knorr ranch, this ranch and the tiny community of Slate Creek

have hardly been touched by modern developments. Even if no 
longer used for their original purpose, the log buildings such 
as the icehouse, the milkshed, toolshed (including old tools, skis, 
an old icebox) and in close vicinity the old schoolhouse with its 
adjacent 'teachery' have remained virtually unchanged. 
Charlie Lund, the 79-year old, semi-retired owner of the Slate 
Creek ranch, is the last surviving member of his family. His Danish 
background aroused my special interest, but other than the custom 
of eating 'Luchtfisk' around Christmas time, a special kind of dry 
fish available in Denver specifically for Scandinavian immigrants, 
he did not remember any Scandinavian traditions. Unfortunately 
there was not enough time to probe more deeply into Charlie Lund's 
life history. 
One cannot help wondering how long these oldtimers, the Knorrs 
and Charlie Lund, will still be around and what will happen to their 
ranches eventually. It becomes an urgent necessity to record and 
preserve the essence of their life styles before they vanish for¬ 
ever. Particularly the Slate Creek ranch suggested to me an ideal 
site for a working ranch museum with its simple log buildings, its 
beautiful setting among creeks, meadows, forest and mountains. 
Moreover, the site lies within reasonable distance from the main 
highway where an interpretive center eventually should point visitors 
to the museum. 
More than learning how to record log buildings and interview 
ranchers, we also got a taste of the nitty-gritty of organizing

and fund raising activities necessary to get:such a project off 
the ground. John Farr, the dynamic local personality par ex¬ 
cellence, drummed up support for us in his newspaper column. 
Rusty gave a talk at a Rotarian breakfast meeting to explain our 
project. These were lessons in what needs to be done to Involve 
the community in a folklife project. Finally, to look at museums 
already existing in the area was an important exercise to recognize 
what was missing and what should be done differently in our future 
museum. 
In short, I found the C080 fieldwork an extremely valuable 
and enjoyable learning experience. Getting acquainted with field¬ 
work techniques and teamwork, I developed a sense of what a folklorist 
or a folklife specialist, can do ’out there in the real world*. 
Moreover, in the process I grew very fond of the people, the beauti¬ 
ful country, the rarefied air of the Blue River Valley and I hope 
to continue working there.
