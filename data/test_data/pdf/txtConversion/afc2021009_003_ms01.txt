Good evening, and thank you so much for coming in and participating in this important research project.
For our record, would you please give me your name?
JH
My name is Jonnie Perryman Hamilton.
CH
What state do you currently live in?
JH
I live in Detroit, Michigan.
CH
Where were you born and raised?
JH
I was born in Tyler, Alabama. I was raised in Detroit and Tyler consecutively because we always had to
go back to Alabama to help out on property that my family had in Alabama.
CH
Tell us a bit about your family background.
JH
I am one of 10 children. I am number four.
CH
Really?
JH
There were five girls, five boys.
CH
Okay.
JH
We actually grew up in Detroit. I went to public school in Detroit from kindergarten to the 12th grade.
Actually, a part of my high school years I was in Ohio because, you know, as families do in my
generation, my father had a sister who had no children and she lived in Ohio. So, if she got sick, he
would send one of his children to help her out. So, I ended up spending, like, a couple of years when I
was in junior high school in Ohio and when I was in high school in Ohio. So, anyway, that was what our
families did, you know. If someone was ill, one of us or one child or another had to go and assist with
that person.
CH
Okay. What year were you born in?
3
XXXXXXX
JH
1943.
CH
What inspired you to become a nurse?
JH
Actually, I had a brother who was, like, four years younger than me and he had sickle cell anemia. He
was the only child of the 10 who had the actual disease. Some of us have the trait; I have the trait. So, he
was always sick and, you know, I would take care of him. And I said, “You know what? I'm going to be
a doctor so that I can find a cure for sickle cell,” because I, you know, it was difficult for him to walk
and he ended up-- Actually, it was really funny because as he got older, his nickname was Crip
[chuckles] because he had a, you know, had a limp. And I didn't think it was really nice but he didn't
mind, so... But yeah, but that was my impetus for being in healthcare was because of him.
CH
Where did you go to nursing school and...
JH
I went to Providence Hospital School of Nursing, which was a two-year diploma program. Well, let me
tell you. There were [counting] four of us that were African Americans in our class out of 100-and-some
people in our class. Myself and Pamela Whitesell, who was also in the sorority, we were in the class
together. In the 70s, it was really, really not conducive for African Americans to be in nursing school.
First of all, it was very hard to get in and then they only admitted a few. I think there were five of us in
our class out of probably 120 students. And then, actually, our rotations were very, very difficult. I'm
going to tell you. I was in my psych rotation and the instructor said, “I don't give A's”.
CH
[Laughs] I've heard that before.
JH
So, what I told her was, “Well, if I earn a A, that's what I expect, because I see what the grading is. So, if
it's what I earn, that's what I expect to get”.
CH
Good for you.
JH 04:41
From that, I think I kind of rubbed her the wrong way. So, we were at a psych rotation. So, we were at
what was Eloise, and Eloise is no longer a hospital in Detroit, but it was where all of the weirdest
syndromes and everything were there. So, when we got into the rotation, you know, like, there were,
like, 10 of us in each rotation. So, we saw this lady up on the, like, a riser and she was naked, throwing
clothes, throwing bedpans and that. So, you know what I said to the other students in the class? I said,
“That's gonna be my patient.” They said, “No, she wouldn't give you that patient.” I said, “Watch. That's
gonna be my patient.” So, sure enough, and when the assignments were made, I was assigned to her. So,
she told me, “Now you have to go up and have a therapeutic conversation with her.” I said, “Okay.” So,
4
XXXXXXX
actually, I went up to the room and-- First of all, when I got there and I told her, I said, “Miss.” I said,
“Would you do me a favor?” I said, “Will you go in your room? We're gonna go in your room.” And I
said, “You're gonna get dressed.” I guess when I looked at her, she knew I wasn't playing. So, we went
to the room and she got dressed. So, I said, “Okay, now you're gonna have to talk to me, because this
depends on my grade,” I said, “and I know you want me to pass, right?” She was an African American
woman, kind of fairly large woman, you know, and I was kind of small. So, she said, “Okay.” She said,
“You know what? I just do that, because [inaudible 6:28] make me mad.” I said, “Yeah, but we're not
gonna do that today, right? We're gonna be in here, we're gonna be nice, we're gonna have this
conversation, and you're gonna give me information that I need so I can write this up.” She said, “Okay,
no problem,” [chuckles]. And I said, “And if you throw anything at me, you know what's gonna
happen?” She said, “What?” I said, “I'm gonna throw it back at you.”
CH
Oh! [laughs]
JH
“This will be our therapy,” [laughs]. That whole day we had a nice conversation. We even had a little
lunch together and everything. I wrote my little progress note up and everything. And so, my instructor
said, “Well, how did you manage to get her to calm down?” I said, “I just talked to her like she was a
normal person.”
CH
You set the tone for that therapeutic milieu right off and you set your boundaries right away.
JH
So, it's like, you know, at the end of that class I did get an A too.
CH
Alright.
JH
Because I said, you know, "You had to have 94 to 100 to get a A. I had 96, so how come I can't get a A,
right?"
CH
That's right. That's right.
JH
It was really difficult and they made it-- the instructors made it difficult. We did have one African
American instructor who taught med surg. She was really very good. She really was helpful for all of the
students, all of the African American students that were in the rotation. She kind of, you know, paved
the way. She would kind of tell us, you know, what the teachers expected and things like that and what
to study, and you don't really need to do that, so she was-- It was very good to have her in our program
as well.

XXXXXXX
CH
Great, great. How long have you been a nurse?
JH
Let me see. I graduated from Providence Hospital in 1973. Actually, I went to work at Mount Carmel
Hospital in pediatrics because I knew that's what I wanted to do. I was gonna be a pediatric nurse. I
wasn't gonna take care of people, older people, but I've done it. I've worked in med surg and worked in
OR, because as my children were older, I had, like, three jobs because, you know, paying tuition and
stuff like that. I worked three jobs at one particular time in my life.
CH
What was that like?
JH
Tiring [laughs], but for me it was, like, it was something that I needed to do just so that I could, you
know, make sure that they didn't have to work as hard. You know, how you always want your children to
be better off than you were, so I knew I had-- When I was in school, even with scholarships and grants
and things like that, I still had to work to pay for tuition and have a car or whatever that you needed,
books and things like that. So, it was kind of difficult. No, really. I just want to say it was difficult,
studying and that. But I have to say, though, that my mother was my saving grace. My mother kept my
children Monday through Friday. I had 'em on the weekend. She said, “It's too hard waking these kids up
so they gotta go to school and stuff like that.” So, it was very-- I don't know how young people do it
today without having someone like that to care for-- that you knew the kids were going to be well cared
for. You wouldn't have to worry about ‘em because it was your mother and you know she was gonna
take care of them. That was really very helpful for me to get through school because once I finished the
program at Providence, I went to my bachelor’s and master’s and, ultimately, a doctorate in nursing.
CH
Where did you go for the rest of your undergraduate studies and your graduate?
JH 10:16
Undergraduate studies, I went to University of Detroit and I got my bachelor's in nursing. Also, my
bachelor's in health service administration also was from University of Detroit. But then, you know,
around the 80s when nurse practitioners were starting, I thought, "This is a good thing. I think I need to
be a nurse practitioner," because, you know, what I told you. Eventually, I was gonna be a doctor. First I
was gonna be a nurse so I could pay for medical school, but when I got to workin’ in the hospital, what I
found is that nurses were the ones who cared for the patients. I was the one who was gonna make sure
that patient got what he needed and that the doctor was gonna be in there five minutes and say, you
know, "This is what you need to do," and write, but I was gonna make sure that those things were going
to be carried out. So, I figured nursing is where I'm going to make the most difference in a patient's life.
So, that was why I decided not to go to medical school. So, like I said, I went to the Nurse Practitioner
program at the University of Michigan. At that point, it wasn't a master's program. I already had a
master's, but the Nurse Practitioner program wasn't a master's program. It was a certificate program. So,
I got the certificate program. Trained with physicians because there were not enough-- then, there were
no nurse practitioners to precept you, so you had to get precepted by a physician, and that was-- it was
okay. Then passed the boards for the nurse practitioner and then started to work as a nurse practitioner.
6
XXXXXXX
Along the way, though, I've had several kinds of jobs in nursing. Actually, most of us started out a staff
nurse. I was a staff nurse. Then I was a head nurse, a nurse manager. I was a director of nursing
education in a hospital. I actually taught at three different schools. I taught at Wayne County Community
College, Wayne State University, and Oakland University as adjunct professor. I never wanted to be, you
know, a tenured professor. That was not what I wanted, because I like, you know, nursing care. I like the
hands-on talking to patients. I like being there. I didn't mind teaching though, because I felt I had
something to be able to give to students. I would lecture some, but when I taught, I did clinicals. That
was what I liked best, to bring the nurses into the facility, show them how to take care of a patient, you
know, make sure that they knew the book, to make sure they would transition that to the bedside. So,
that was why I was teaching. So, that's why I was probably just adjunct professor. I didn't need to be the
professor because I would lecture sometimes, but that wasn't really what I liked to do. I liked the clinical
part better.
CH
In what areas of clinical practice did you teach?
JH
Actually, pediatrics [laughs]. I actually taught Fundamentals because they thought I was the best
Fundamentals teacher. So, I taught Fundamentals of Nursing.
CH
Now, that was lecture or...
JH
No, I taught Fundamentals lecture, and then in the lab, you know. Then, you were teaching people how
to make beds and putting IVs and all those things so, yeah. That was basically what I was teaching,
Fundamentals of Nursing, and then I would teach pediatrics lecture as well as precepting on the units.
CH
You mentioned that you had a master's when you were doing the NP program. What area was that?
JH
Master's in Health Service Administration.
CH
Okay. After you had the certificate as a nurse practitioner, did they require you to go back to get a
master's?
JH
No.
CH
You're grandfathered in.
7
XXXXXXX
JH
Yeah. At that point, we got grandfathered in because we had already passed the boards. So, no, we got
grandfathered in. We didn't have to get a Master's in Nursing, so my Master's in Health Service
Administration was fine.
CH
And that was in the 80s?
JH
Yeah.
CH
Okay.
JH
I graduated from that program in 1980. That's when I became a nurse practitioner.
CH
Okay. So, you were, like, a pioneer in that. That is so exciting. And the doctorate, what is that in?
JH
I was one of the first. I was in, actually, the second class at University of Michigan for nurse
practitioners. Well actually, my doctorate is in Nursing Practice as a DNP.
CH
Okay.
JH 14:56
Actually, first of all, I started out at Wayne in the PhD program. I was there for a year and I was like,
"This just really isn't for me." I don't mind research. I really like research. I like to find out what things
happen, but it was, like, I just couldn't get my head around it as far as what they were requiring. So, then
Oakland University started the first DNP program in Michigan. I was not in the first cohort, but I was in
the second cohort of the DNP program at Oakland University. And then I found that this is what I want
to do a doctorate in. I did my capstone project on asthma education because I had developed a program,
an asthma program, called-- Well, now it's changed to Deep Breath, but it was my program. What did I
call it? I'm so used to now it being Deep Breath because that's the second name that was doing it. But I
wrote the program and tested it out at several schools, because at that point, I was actually the primary
[inaudible 16:19] at one of the schools in the school-based health centers that I now manage 27 of 'em,
but I started out as being a practitioner in one of the schools and developed the program which is used--
In all of our schools we still use the program. So, that's what I did my capstone project, you know. So,
what I did was I looked at students, their learning, how it affected their grades, kids with asthma. If they
were in a program and learned how to take care of themselves and take care of their asthma, they were
able to stay in school and not be out of school. They were able to utilize a peak flow meter and know
when they needed to be using their inhaler, learning how to especially use their inhaler correctly,
because a lot of kids they didn't know how to use the inhaler. They were just puffing and not getting
anything in their lungs. So, that was some of the things we taught. Actually, taught them how to
8
XXXXXXX
exercise, how to deep breathe so that if they started to wheeze, they could almost take care of
themselves, because without even using medication they could relax and breathe and be able to make
sure that their lungs got better because they were, you know, utilizing those muscles to make sure that
their lungs were open and that. So, yeah, and learn how to take the medication and learn how to care for
it, because a lot of kids they were going around with their inhalers in their pockets. They were all dirty
and what. "No! You can't-- That's not how to take care of your inhaler. You gotta do it correctly." So,
that was a part of the program that I developed. And making sure that we looked at how their grades
improved, you know, when they started the program and when they ended the program. Then we looked
at it a year later so that we could see if that did help and if they were still able to manage even out of the
program when they were in another grade and were able manage their program. So, I was able to
validate that program so now it's used in all of our health centers, and it really does work.
CH
You certainly have made an impact in the lives of children and you've made an impact for nursing as
well. What is your current position?
JH 18:40
Well, currently I work for Ascension Michigan Community Health and I manage the school-based health
centers, of which we have 27 in five counties in Michigan. So, what my job entails is that I manage--
Most of our health centers are staffed by a nurse practitioner, either pediatrics or family, with a
master's-prepared mental health provider and a medical assistant. So, they provide physical and mental
health inside of the school buildings and immunizations. They do education. They do physical exams,
sports physicals, whatever a kid needs. They take sick care. They manage chronic illnesses, kids that are
diabetic, kids that have epilepsy, kids who, you know, have asthma or other kinds of problems. So, they
manage all of those in the school building. So, it makes it easier for parents when there's a school-based
health center in their school building because they don't have to worry about, you know, bringing their
kid in if he's sick. A lot of times now they tell the kid [chuckles], “You go to school. The nurse will take
care of you. There's a doctor at the school. She’ll take care of you.” So, yeah, so basically that’s what I
do. Actually, that involves grant writing as well, because our health centers are funded by the state of
Michigan, the Michigan Department of Community Health. We do get some Medicaid match funding.
So, we have to do grants and write proposals and make sure that we, you know, once you got a grant,
you gotta do reports. You gotta report how you spend their money and that. So, basically, a lot of my job
is managerial, but I still like to do clinical, so I will go to a health center and take care of patients. In our
high schools we do school-wide sexual education as well, and then we do treat and we do testing. If kids
are positive, we treat them and that. And it's all confidential. And then we do other programs, like we do
some screenings for, like, we may do a blood pressure screening and see how many kids have elevated
blood pressure. Even if they don't come to the clinic regularly, we are able to see them when we do those
kinds of blitzes.
CH
You mentioned that you have a managerial role. Do staff report to you?
JH
Yes, they report to me.
9
XXXXXXX
CH
Are you responsible for continuing education for them? Do you do the hiring and the firing?
JH
[Chuckles] I do the firing and the letting people go as necessary. Yes, and I actually make sure that we--
There are some certain education that all of our nurse practitioners have to do annually, so we have to do
those. We have to do what we call point-of-care and credentialing so that everybody is maintaining, like,
their BLS, their medications, their immunizations and that. So, we do that. I'm responsible for making
sure that that happens. I don't have to do all the teaching anymore, but I am a certified BLS instructor so
I do do classes for them as well. Actually, I'm also responsible for making sure that our staffing is
always adequate. You know, when people are out or if they get people on leave and things like that, I
have to make sure that every center is staffed every day.
CH
So, you have to help to coordinate the care and the staffing.
JH
Right. And I have to, you know, I have to review policies and procedures annually, because they have to
be updated, so that’s a part of my job. I have to make sure that we do audits to make sure that staff are
doing what they need to do, as far as making sure that they are charting appropriately, billing
appropriately and that, so a lot of that is my responsibility as well.
CH
Are you involved in writing policy as well?
JH
Yes [chuckles].
CH
Tell us a little bit about that.
JH
Writing and reviewing policies. So, policies have to change, you know. It depends on that. Actually, I
was one of the first people who started the school-based health centers for Ascension, so all the policies
that were made, I wrote [chuckles]. I had to write all the policies that had to do with how you deal with
medication, how you give medications, so what do you do for charting, consents, all of the things that
are necessary for doing a health center. Also, we had to have the roles for RNs and medical assistants, so
they have different policies. So, we had to write policies and procedures for them as well as make
standing orders for our RNs, had to have standing orders so that they were able to give the vaccines. Our
MNAs had to have standing orders-- what they could do within their scope. So, those had to be right.
And we have to review those every year too. So, we have a medical director who is a family practice
physician, but she always tells me, “You know how to do it. Just do it and then I'll sign it.”
CH
What is the most difficult part about being a nurse leader?
10
XXXXXXX
JH
Most difficult part. I would say the most difficult part is when you have to let somebody go. For me,
personally, that's very hard because I know-- I am empathetic because, as a nurse, you're a caring person.
This is what you do. You are a nurse because you care. So then if you have to sit down and tell a person
that because of, whatever, certain things that happened that you no longer have a position, that's not
easy, especially when people have families and things like that. It's very hard. That's the hardest part for
me. I can do everything else. Even though I can do it, and I have learned to do it with empathy, you
know. I want that person to leave without themselves being at fault. It’s not that it’s you, it’s what
happened, how you did whatever it is, but it's not you personally. So, trying to make them feel that
they're still a worthwhile individual.
CH
Since you have a seat at the decision-making table, how do the policies you’re involved in developing
and implementing impact the nurses in your organization, and how do your policies impact your
organization?
JH 25:52
Well, they do because first of all, it makes everyone safe. We have policies because you want things to
be done appropriately. You don't want to harm anyone. You want to make sure that your policies-- that
people are aware that the policies are not there to hinder people. They're there to help you. So, our
policies are made and written so that the outcome is what you're looking for. So, that's basically how I
see policies. They help the nurse. They help the behavioral health person. They help the medical
assistant. They help you do your job so that you are doing the best for the patient that you're caring for
and that it's gonna make you safe. It's gonna make the person safe.
CH
Yeah, so that goes back to that principle of “first, do no harm”.
JH
That's correct.
CH
That we all have learned in the nursing…
JH
Nurses Creed, right?
CH
Do you feel that the administration in your organization values the contributions that nurses make to
healthcare?
JH
You know, I think overall I think that's true but, you know, because nurses are the most trusted health
care provider, everybody says. It doesn't even matter. We're always number one or number two, you
know, as far as the overall trajectory of how people feel about nursing, how they feel about any
profession. So, I believe though that we bring something to the table that no one else does, because not
11
XXXXXXX
only the science of nursing, we bring the feeling of nursing, we bring the empathy of nursing, the caring
of nursing. So, I think that's what makes us unique as a profession.
CH
Then we got to talk about Chi Eta Phi a little bit [both chuckling]. We'll come back to some of the areas
for nursing. How long have you been a member of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated?
JH
35 years this March.
CH
Okay!
JH
Yeah.
CH
What region and chapter are you in?
JH
I'm in the Middle West region, Lambda Chi chapter, Detroit, Michigan.
CH
Have you held any offices on the local, regional, national level?
JH
Okay, on local level I was the historian, and I’ve probably led every committee in the local chapter. I
was the Regional Director for our Middle West region, and actually I am a First Vice President for
national Chi Eta Phi Sorority.
CH
Okay. That's your current office that you hold?
JH
That's my current office, yes.
CH
What contributions or accomplishments have you established since your tenure?
JH
In national?
CH
Yeah.
12
XXXXXXX
JH 29:00
At national level actually I have revamped a lot of things as far as programs and projects. I've tried to
sort of streamline that process reporting, utilizing Survey Monkey for people to report so that I could
look at how we were doing across the country, how we were doing in each area of our practice, each
area of our goals and objectives. I have streamlined our service awards, making sure that we were--
chapters were able to meet certain criteria for those awards. I thought it was a good idea for us to
recognize people for their years of service, so I started with a five year up to infinatum, wherever. So,
every five years people will get recognized for being a continuous member of Chi Eta Phi Sorority
Incorporated. I think we need to let people know that we appreciate them, and having a pin or a plaque
or a certificate for your membership, I think that lets them know that you really care about them being in
this organization. And also looked at making sure that people did pursue the chapter grants, because the
money was there but people were not utilizing it. So, I kind of made sure that people were aware that the
grants were available, show them what the process was and how they could be given that grant money.
So, every year that I have been in my position, we've been able to give two to three chapters money for a
research project. Actually, I looked at how they were to report that, and most of ‘em have and do poster
presentations, written articles, and that. One of the chapters now has an article in our [inaudible 31:00]
from the project that they were grant-funded for.
CH
That's really impressive. Now, you spoke about projects and programs. Can you tell us about the projects
and the programs?
JH
Okay, well, you know, actually, the signature program for Chi Eta Phi has always been blood pressure
and making sure that all of our chapters across the country are doing blood pressure, because that's one
of the things that is-- Hypertension is a really major killer and debilitator of African American people.
So, making sure that we are looking at blood pressure, teaching people how to maintain a proper blood
pressure or, if they have hypertension, how to treat it, and making sure that they know when they need to
be taken care of. That is our signature program, but the other thing is heart disease now in women is
another one of the things that we are concerned about. We do our Heart Month. Other is kidney disease.
That's another one of the projects that we do is we do Kidney Sundays in March. We have actually about
30 national partners that we work with, making sure that we are involved in all aspects of healthcare. We
have some that we provide funding for, like for St. Jude Hospital and the March of Dimes. We do make
a sizable donation to them annually. Other projects that we work really hard with, like I said, we do our
Heart-- in February, we always have our Heart Month. We do our Go Red for Women on the first Friday
in February. We do Kidney Sunday all through March. We do breast cancer in October, making sure that
we make aware of how to help women and making sure that they do get exams and mammograms for
women. We do some things for men too. We work with Omega Psi Phi in the Prostate Month, making
sure that men are aware and that they get their exams and digital rectal exams and making sure they get
their PSAs and helping with some screenings, and that we do as well. So, those are just a few of the
programs and projects that we do. But we are now working with Nurses on Boards, which is another
project that I really love because we're making sure that we have women on boards nationally, locally
and regionally have women that are on boards. So, all of us, not just nursing boards, but other boards as
well. For me, I sit on several boards: the Federation of Youth Services, which is a nonprofit in Detroit
which houses teenage girls who, for some reason, are not in their own homes. We have programs like
that. Also, I am on the board of Delta Manor, which is a senior citizens’ building that's owned by Delta
13
XXXXXXX
Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated, and I'm on that board as well. And I'm on boards of some other
nursing organizations: the Michigan Nurses Association, Detroit Black Nurses Association, my Nurse
Practitioner Association. So, I'm really active in nursing, not only with Chi Eta Phi but with other
nursing organizations as well.
CH
How is it going with members of Chi Eta Phi being on boards?
PH 34:57
I think we've been doing better than the statistics show, because what is happening is that I don't think
everybody is listing or going on the Nurses on Boards Coalition website and signing up. Because if you
look at on the local, national and regional level, those are boards. People need to, you know, say that,
you know, “I'm the Vice President. I'm the President of this chapter. I'm the Regional Director. I’m this,”
you know, “the Second Vice President of Chi Eta Phi.” Those are board recognitions, you know. Like I
told people in my chapter, because one of my chapter members, she's the President of ANA Michigan.
“You’re not on the list! You know, you're ANA Michigan President.”
CH
So, we gotta get the word out.
JH
And she's a member of Chi Eta Phi too, so it's like, yeah, making sure that people do. It doesn't matter
which boards you’re on. We have one of our nurses who was on the school board. She got elected to the
school board. She's a member of my chapter. And I'm saying, “Iris, you didn't put your stuff on the
thing,” you know. So, yeah, we need to make sure that people get recognized for what they do and, you
know, being on the board. So, workin’ on it.
CH
Maybe need to make the announcement so that we understand that…
JH
I think I’ll put that in one of the service letters.
CH
That’d be great because, you know, over the years when I've seen the representative from Nurses on
Boards, I thought it was a board, you know, that was outside of Chi Eta Phi. All these years, I've never
heard your involvement with being on your local level, regional level and national level, those are
considered boards, you know. I'm looking at, like, being on the board of a bank, the board at a hospital,
but now we already have a clarification.
JH
Because, you know, all those boards are there. So, I think we don’t-- we're not getting the recognition.
So, I think that's a good idea. I’m gonna put that in a service letter.
CH
Yes, gotta do that.
14
XXXXXXX
JH
Alright.
CH
So, let's talk about the service letter, since you mentioned service letter. What is the service letter about?
JH
The service letter is actually a monthly information for members to tell them what's going on in the
sorority.
CH
Members of Chi Eta Phi?
JH
Yeah, members of Chi Eta Phi, telling them what's going on, what's coming up, how they can
participate, what they need to do, letting them know all of the things that are happening on the national
level. That's the service letter. My region puts out a service letter too. So, my regional director puts out a
service letter to let us know what's happening in the region. And my chapter Basileus does a-- What
does she call hers? No, regional is the Triumphant Turtle. Our local one is-- She changed the name. She
calls it The President's Message or something, but anyway…
CH
And the Basileus is the President.
JH
The Basileus is the President.
CH
Want to use our civil terms--
JH
Yeah, the president of the organization.
CH
So that people will understand who we're talking about.
JH
Right, yes.
CH
Since you have an executive board position, you kinda have a bird's eye view of the organization. What
direction do you see the organization going in?
JH
Actually, now I'm in the second administration that I've worked with, so I'm looking at them seeing a
more inclusive board, making sure that members are included in all aspects of what's going on. I'm
15
XXXXXXX
seeing we're being more business professionally. So, now that we have an executive director, so I think
we're growing, being able to-- that we have someone in our office daily, an Executive Director, and we
also have an office manager. So, things like that. I think that's moving in a direction where we're being a
more-- gonna be looked at as a more professional organization, like, similar to, you know, ANA and
NBNA on the national level. I think we are coming into our own.
CH
In the climate of racial unrest and inequality in health care, can you share any insights, and you already
gave us a little bit of the experience that you had as a student nurse, but any experiences in your current
position that you have faced?
JH 39:58
Well, let me see. I'm gonna go back a little bit and tell you about a incident when I became the head
nurse at a local hospital in Detroit. I was the second African-- No, I was the first African American head
nurse in this hospital and I was called to the Vice President of Nursing’s office and she asked me, she
said, “I have been told that you are hiring several more,” she was trying to get it out, “more African
American nurses on your unit.” And I listened to her and I let her continue to talk and I said, “Okay.” I
said, “Did you bring up the nurse that's on--" I was on 2 West and 2 East. I said, “The Filipino nurse
that’s on 2 East or the Caucasian nurse that’s on 4 West?” I said, “Look at their units and tell me who's
hiring who.” I said, “I hire people who are qualified, who are interested in pediatrics, who have pediatric
experience. Just that because they're African American doesn't make a difference.” And I said, “So,
when you can tell me that there is not an African American nurse on 4 East. The head nurse is
Caucasian. There's not an African American nurse on 2 East. She's a Filipino. There's no African
American nurses there. So, did you bring her into the office and ask her why she was hiring all those
Filipino people? Did you bring her in here and tell her why she's hiring all those Caucasian nurses? Why
are you talking to me?”
CH
And what was her response?
JH
She could not say a word. So, I said, “When you bring us all back together and we decide how we're
going to be equal in what we do, then I'm willing to listen to you. Until then, I will hire who is qualified
to work on pediatrics. So, if you don't find any fault in that, then we don't need to talk.”
CH
And the care was not subpar.
JH
Oh no! Excellent. Better than any other floor. Actually, that was really not my first incident there,
because when I got the job as the head nurse, I had a-- Yeah, I had my master's in administration. No, I
didn't. I had a bachelor's, but the people that were interviewing for the position was a diploma nurse and
me. She was Caucasian and, you know, I'm definitely Black [both laugh]. So, when we had our
interviews-- And I had been working the midnight shift since ‘73, so this was about ’75, ’76, so I had
been there like about three or four years so, you know, I knew-- and actually, I was the charge nurse on
midnights, afternoon, wherever I was at, you know, so I knew how to, you know, do it and all the staff,
16
XXXXXXX
no matter who they were, all said when I was there things would run better because I was always fair.
And even though I was in charge, I had patients. None of the other charge nurses would take a patient. I
had patients because I would assign myself patients, and they weren't the easy patients. I would assign
myself patients, like, maybe not as many as everybody had, but I would have one that was a difficult
patient and maybe my other two would be, you know, up and running around. So, when the job was
posted, you know, I applied, she applied. We did our interviews and they gave her the position. So, at the
end of the day I went home and I was talking to my sister. I said, “You know what?” I said, “I think I'm
going to go and talk to the president of the hospital.” She said, “Why?” I said, “Because they just passed
me over for a position that I know I'm qualified for.” She said, “You gonna do that?” I said, “Mmhmm.”
And she said, “They're gonna fire you.” I said, “Then I'll get another job,” I said, “‘cause nurses can get
a job any day.” I said, “I can leave this hospital and go down the street and get another job.” So, she
said, “Okay.” So, I made an appointment with the Vice President of the hospital. And, you know, his
secretary wanted to know what was it about. And I told her, I said, “It's about a position in the Pediatric
department.” She said, “Okay.” So, it took him a week to get me an appointment, ‘cause you know he
had to go talk to everybody to find out why I was meeting him. So, when we went up there-- And the
position actually did not-- the education [inaudible 45:37] just said, “You need to be an RN with two
years of experience,” you know. So, it didn't say you had to have a degree or anything like that, you
know. So, he sat down with me. He said, “You told me that I had a problem.” I said, “Yes, I think-- I
have a problem,” I said, “because I think I was just overlooked for a position that I am qualified for.”
And I said, “I am more qualified than the person who got the position.” He said, “Why do you think
that?” I said, “If you would go and ask any of the staff on the unit that we’re talking about and they will
tell you who is the better manager.” He said, “Okay.” And I said, “So, I'm really upset about it.” And I
said, “At this point, I could probably sue you for discrimination,” [laughs]. He looked at me like, “This
woman is crazy”.
CH
You didn’t have no sense to tell him that, right? [laughs]
JH
You could tell by the look on his face that he was looking at me, like, “Really? You really are real
serious here.” So, he said, “Okay. Well, I'll look into it.” So, a couple of weeks later, she was moved to
another unit and because I had already applied, they told me that I could have the position. I said, “I'm
not having it.” I said, “I earned this position because of my work ethic, you know, how I am able to talk
to my staff and everything.” I guess I've always been a rebel because, you know, if I think I'm right, I'm
right. I will go for it and, like I said, I will fight for any of them. And, like I said, when I first started on
that unit too, I was actually the only Black African American RN but there were, like, six or seven
LPNs. And I told them all, I said-- ‘cause I started on midnights and, you know, when you're fresh out of
school, you don't know nothing. I knew book stuff and I really thought I was a good RN, but then there
were things that those people who had worked on that unit for years knew. So, I told them all, I said,
“You need to go to school.” All of them except one. I got all of them except one right now are RNs.
Every last one of ‘em except one got to be an RN, but Barbara told me that she wasn't going to school. I
said, “Well, you know what?” I said, “You will be better. You'll do better goin’ to school.” She said,
“No, I'm okay where I am.” But, yeah. So, those were some other things. And I like to make sure that-- I
think everybody should have opportunities. And actually, with Wayne State, I started the program at the
hospital so that they could work and take their classes and get their RNs.
17
XXXXXXX
CH
That's great. That's great. That's a great help. Even with my own educational experience, I had jobs
where I was able to work and go to school, so that really makes a difference. It really empowers and it
makes sure that we are able to advance in that way. We are experiencing a historical and challenging
time in healthcare, as I'm sure I don’t have to tell you. It's also challenging for our society and nursing in
the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. How has it impacted your practice and the practice of the nurses
that you manage in the school system?
JH 49:47
Actually, the first impact was when, you know, schools closed, so our nurses were-- Where you gonna
go? There's school closure; there’s no students. So, a lot of my-- they got deployed within the system,
within Ascension, some of ‘em who had not been in the hospital in eons. So, at that point, it was up to
me to make sure that they were okay. I would make rounds at all of the hospitals, because they deployed
‘em at, you know, three of our hospitals: one on the eastside, one Providence, which is right across from
my office, and then Novak, so those three hospitals. I would visit a hospital every day.
CH
So, they were sent to deploy to do bedside?
JH
Mmhmm.
CH
They couldn't find ‘em a clinic position or anything?
JH
No, they didn't actually-- were not doing bedside. They were checking. Sometimes they were doing fit
testing for [inaudible 50:52]. They were making sure that mask supply and all of the stuff that they were
doing. If some of them were at the bedside, they would have probably been-- they'd have probably all
quit [chuckles]. But anyway, no. So, having to support my nurses during that time of deployment. And
my point was, I was trying to make sure that we got ‘em, so I implemented telehealth. So, I said, “You
know what? Now we can see our patients. We can talk to them on the phone. We got all of their charts.
Let's start calling our patients.” So, I was able to bring all of my nurses back to the schools. And even
though they were not-- and all the schools were virtual, our health centers have doors that you don't have
to go through the school to get to the clinic. So, I brought ‘em all back into their facilities. We started
doing telehealth. If we needed to see a patient, we were able to get air cleaners and have everything that
we needed so if we needed to bring a patient in to see them in person, we were able to do that. So, we
were able to weather that. I think they were jumping for joy when I told ‘em, “All y'all are coming back.
They gonna have to find somebody else to do them jobs ya’ll doin’ because you’re comin’ back to your
job.” Actually, I think it's made nurses more resilient. It's made them more-- actually, I think, more
compassionate, because seeing all of what was going on during the very hardest of the pandemic where
people were dying, like, 10, 15 and 20 people a day, when the morgue at the hospital was overflowing,
when you had ice trucks out in the back of the parking lot. That really happened. So, I think it made
people-- Actually, we did some meditation and mindfulness so that people were-- And actually, my
psych background is not the greatest, but I knew that people were hurting so I knew that we needed to
have something. So, I said, “We have behavioral [inaudible @ 53:13] in all of our health centers. You
18
XXXXXXX
guys need to talk to each other and then talk to our staff.” So, being able to, you know, have that entity
so that we were able to have it and we would have, like, what we called “sacred listening circles”, so
that people could talk about their feelings and know that it was not going to be spread all over the world,
even if it was something that you really felt you were really hurting about or things were happening for
you. Made sure that if people were having family problems or somebody was sick at home, that we
would make sure that they were allowed to work at home and, you know, talk to their patients on the
phone at home so they could stay with that person that was sick. We did allow those things just to make
sure that I was able to support my staff. So, we all had to think outside of the box.
CH
Yes, yes. So, it sounds like as a nurse leader, you are forward thinking, that you are able to do
exceptional crisis management.
JH
Yeah, because it was like, you know, at that point, you know, my boss was telling me that if we gotta pay
these people, they gotta work. So, in my head, I said, “Okay.” I needed to deploy them at that point, but
as the deployment I'm always thinking, “Okay, how can I bring all my staff back? What can I do to get
them back?” So, you know, we had telehealth. I'm thinking, “Why not? Can we call all our kids?” you
know. Parents will love us for calling their kids and seeing how they're doing. So, you know, I'm saying
“Let's do it.” I said, “Okay.” So, then I went back to my VP and I said, “Okay, we're gonna do telehealth
and we're gonna get all our kids back and all my staff back in school.” And she said, “Oh, that's a good
idea. That's fine,” you know. She was supportive to do that. So, yeah, so we were able to…
JH
And you're supportive as well. You helped empower your staff, and I think that's a great trait. So, to that
end, what characteristic do you feel a nurse leader needs to have?
JH 55:26
I think first of all and foremost, you need to actually have the knowhow. You have to have some skills,
both physical skills and mental skills. Then I think you have to be compassionate. You have to be able to
look at people and see them for who they are and not what they are. For me, I always feel that I don't ask
anyone to do anything that I would not do myself, okay. So, that means that I'm not going to badger you
with things that because I wouldn't want to do it for myself. So, that's how I lead. And I try to lead by
example. I always try to let people know that I'm always thinking not for you, I'm thinking about you.
So, what I do to help you learn and grow is I want you to be better, you know. So, even when I have to
do, you know-- We do evaluations and we have to do check-ins with people. Those check-ins are to
make sure that you are comfortable with what you're doing and if you're not comfortable, feel that you
can tell me about what you're not comfortable and let me help you to elevate it. If you need a class, if
you need something, let me help you do that. But if you don't let me know, I can't do it. So, I always
want people to realize that you can always talk to me, okay. I'm here to listen, you know. And I always
tell people, “You don't work for me, you work with me,” you know. You will never hear me say, “I'm
your boss,” or, “You work for me.” I work with you, you work with me, okay, because that makes us all
better if we're in it together, okay. So, you know, and then some people will say, “Oh, you're our boss.” I
said, “No. I am the manager of this unit, but nobody’s a boss,” okay. I don't boss word-- even Boss's
Day, I don't like-- it's not, you know. So, I think it's a problem of making sure that people understand
that, that people realize that you're there for them and you're there to help them. So, one of my strengths
19
XXXXXXX
is making people grow, being better. If I see that you have a strength, I am going to put you in a place
where that strength is gonna grow, you know. So, I told her I can't make everybody a leader, I can't make
everybody a manager, but I can give you leadership tasks to do which will make you grow and then you
may see another space where you need to be and you can grow. And I tell people, “You don't want to
stay in the same place all the time. You want to grow,” okay. And, like, now that I have some medical
assistants, I said, “You guys can go to school.”
CH
Absolutely.
JH
You know, I need to be replaced. I need somebody that looks like me to replace me. So, I have, like,
three of my MA’s are in nursing school right now.
CH
Congratulations!
JH
And, you know, I told ‘em if you, you know, need anything, I said, “I can get you some DBA
scholarships. I can get you some Chi Eta Phi scholarships [chuckles], you know. You need to, you know,
so you can-- to work.” And then I said, “And once you get into the program, I can get you some more
money,” you know, because you got to do prerequisites and stuff like that. So, but making sure that they
know that I'm there to help them, to promote them, and I'm willing, you know. And one of the girls says,
“You mean, you’ll help me with my work?” I said, “If you need help with your work, yeah, I’ll help you
with your work.” I said, “You all know that I teach nursing as well so, you know, if you’re having a
problem, you know, let me know, because I don't want you to fail because you didn't ask if I could help
you.”
CH
That's right. So, you have a trusting open door policy. Perhaps that's a characteristic as well that a nurse
leader needs to possess.
JH
You can't be closed. You have to be open to actually new ideas. I tell people, you know, “If you think of
a way that's gonna help us work better, bring it to me. I don't know everything, don't profess to know
everything and I'm always open to new ideas. So, let's talk about something. If we have a process that
we've been doing and we've been doing like that for a long time, if it's not working let's find something
else. Let's fix it.”
CH
So, that's logical, right?
JH
Let's fix it.
20
XXXXXXX
CH
Logical and, again, honest, and that's what we need to possess as nurses. We need to be transparent, we
need to be honest, so that those coming behind us can feel like, “I can do this.”
JH
Right.
CH
This is doable.
JH
That's right. And it's doable. You can always do it better.
CH
How about that? And I am not threatened by that [laughs].
JH
Absolutely not. Absolutely not.
CH
Yes. So, what is your vision for the future of nursing?
JH 1:01:01
The future of nursing. I mean, you know, people have written a whole lot about it. We're looking at what
nursing 2030, you know, and all the things that the researchers are saying about nursing, okay, about
where nursing should be. The art and science of nursing, and how do we put that in a forward position,
you know? If you go back to when I first started in nursing when we had to put ice and stuff in O2 tents.
You don’t remember that?
JH
Not in my day [laughs], was not my day.
JH
Ok, alright. Well, you know, and now you don't have to have all that stuff. When we used to have to
sharpen needles and now you just throw them away.
CH
And that hurts me so bad.
JH
You know, everything is disposable now. When you used to sterilize everything, you went to central
supply. Now, central supply they just pack up stuff and it's already there, you know.
CH
The glass IV bottle.
21
XXXXXXX
JH
Yes, yes, that had to be washed. Not only the IV bottles but the formula bottles that we were sterilizing,
nipples and stuff, you know. So, nursing has evolved. So, now we don't have to do everything, you
know, but the nurse is-- I think we all have to realize that you are the center of the patient's care. The
nurse is the center of the patient's care. They're either going to get better because of a nurse or they're not
gonna get better because of a nurse.
CH
And that is the truth. That's a fact.
JH
That’s a fact, because that care will be the-- Even if you know that the outcome is not gonna be good,
the care that that nurse provides still has a significant effect on that person.
CH
That's right, because of the intimacy, and we're back to the trust again.
JH
Right, because that’s what’s happened. So, I see nursing continue to evolve. I see us utilizing more
science in how we do our nursing, looking at more evidence for our practice, looking at, basically, not
what we do, how we do it, and make sure that that all works and meshes together, with the outcome
being that what is gonna be better for our patient.
CH
So, what words of wisdom would you give to novice nurses and those considering the profession of
nursing?
JH
I will always say nursing, there is no limit to the possibilities. There is no limit to the possibilities. We
are from the bedside to the White House. So, nurses are everywhere, and because of how we are
educated, we are able to do almost anything, you know, almost anything because of how we're educated.
We're educated not only in science but the art, science and care of nursing.
CH
And technology.
JH
Right, and technology, and you being able to utilize that to bring the whole together. So, there's no limit
to the possibilities.
CH
What difference does Chi Eta Phi make in service for humanity?
JH 1:04:40
What difference? Well, we do make a lot, because Chi Eta Phi chapters across this country every day are
making a difference in someone's life. I just would say just a little-- Now what we're doing in our
22
XXXXXXX
chapter is that we are making Valentine's cards to go in the Meals on Wheels, meals that are going to be
passed out to seniors, specific little ones that are gonna go in each package so that they know that
somebody cares about them, not just because they got a meal but somebody took the time to make a
handmade card and put it in there for you.
CH
That's so wonderful.
JH
Then, the other thing is that in my other life, my other red and white life, we are doing care packages for
our veterans on Veterans Day. Usually we prepare a meal and go to one of the veterans shelters, but this
year we're doing care packages for them. They will have gloves, masks, hand sanitizer and that. We're
collecting that and we're going to deliver those to VA shelters that are in Detroit. So, every day we make
a difference. We do something for somebody, even if it's just a student. We may call up a student
because the student was having a problem with an exam and we call that student up and say, “Let me
help you with that. Let me show you how to study. Let me show you how to take a test.” So, I think
every day we are across this country doing little things and big things, little things for individuals, big
things for groups, and making sure that our model of service for humanity is carried out in everything
that we do in every chapter, in every region, and at the national level.
CH
That we are walking, talking, breathing service for humanity.
JH
Yes, we are.
CH
And finally, what are your thoughts on our beloved Chi Eta Phi and words of wisdom towards service
for humanity?
JH
Ah, that's a mouthful, right? Actually, Chi Eta Phi for me is a sisterhood and brotherhood not only
bonded by profession but by caring for others. That's why I see Chi Eta Phi for me. That it is the
organization that gives me the collectiveness of all the nurses that I know across the country but also, for
me, that we care about humanity. We care because this is what Chi Eta Phi is about. It's not about a party
or this or that. It is about what we can do for someone else, whether it's a nursing student, whether it's a
senior citizen, whether it's a homeless person, whether it's a youth, you know. We take care of everyone
from the cradle to the grave. So, I think that's what the green and yellow means. Not just the colors, not
just what all the other little things that go around, but because of the bond that nurses have for people.
That's where the humanity comes in, because we are an organization that cares for people and we care
for each other.
CH
Excellent, excellent. So, Madam First Vice President, Dr. Jonnie…
