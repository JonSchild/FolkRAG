wouldn't know nuthing about something like that myself. And that's the way they done and
that's the way a lot of them old timers done. During the war . But it was awful in here. And I
said - I told my son - I said they fought to free this country and now they want to take it and
make a wilderness. Why? I can't see it. And then they fought - this war was only fought
because somebody wants to take over.
S2: I said other people they got the bombs.
S: Well, that's what they say they'd do. They're trying to keep them from taking - I don't
know why they want to take the land when the people has got their own land. But I told my
son I said well that's all right. But they're going to fight for that land and I think they'll have
a war right here in the United States. I'm not sure but I believe they will. Cause they ain't
going to give up that easy. And they went over there to their meeting, but you know they
wouldn't stay. And its this forest service I guess you must know about the forest service

long. They said they want to show them how beautiful it is, well I think its just a beautiful

S2: That's one of the craziest ideas there ecer was. I've worked for the forestry service
and I know they deaden trees and flatten down around fifty percent of the pine log trees.
I walked off one from one of them trees I didn't even deaden it. My boss said well you're
gonna have to do it and I walked off and left it.
S: Well, you take these trees and you kill them. You know we get our <gap> from those
for school kids. You know my nephew he said he would let them cut a bit off of his land.
Because you take all this fuel away and you got no breathing space. You take so much
timber you know for breathing. And he said I ain't gonna let them cut a stick. That is Jimmy
Young. And whenever you have to ask them if you can cut wood or anything thats getting
pretty bad. And they're aimes to take all this right in here and I said they want to make
this a wilderness like it was at start. You know this used to be a wilderness all of it. And
they've, they's some pretty places in these woods. And pretty country all through here.
And people that has come through here you know they've took pictures. And they say why
don't you make a book of this pretty country. Where people used to live and houses and
things. Why don't you make a book of that? Well I don't know how.

S: Yeah we have a garden nearly every year, but last year we made a boo-boo because
you know it rained so much and then when it quit it just burnt up. You had two spells like
that. But last year I bought beans, green beans and canned them. And when I canned
them I had green beans. But we just lost <unintelligible text> everything nearly. We didn't
have nothing only a few <unintelligible text> And <unintelligible text> had a few tomatoes
but they soon burnt up Some years you do that way, but Daddy always told me every
seven years you should rest that whole year. And I found out if you don't you make a of
somebody. And every seven years you should rest one year.

My daddy said if you didn't he didn't make no crop.
F: You should rest or you should rest your garden for seven years?
S: You should rest your garden or rest yourself. You shouldn't tend the garden daddy said.
Every seven years. And the rest of the years you should save and can what you need.
And lots of people do. Now my niece and her husband in Kansas City you know rase a
big garden every year. She brought me some potatoes of what she had. Just in her little
garden. Of course she lives and they raise everything she showed me some pictures she
had of her food house she had a lot of food items and everybody can do that with it. Work
at it. Do you make a garden every year? I know your dad does.

and weighing too much. I'll be seventy-one my birthday. And I've said I'll quit going in the
woods. My son got to where he don't want me to go in the woods. He said he's afraid I'll
fall and hurt myself. Where I used to didn't fall and hurt myself bad as he did <gap>. I
could get around good. Til you know, just the last few years. I think its good, I used to get
out with my kids and run races with them. Well my nephew, run races with him I've quit
