Where the Little Roses Bloom. 
OUR FAVORITE SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by JAMES R. WALsix. Sung by WALSH and KING, 
'Twas an evening in midsummer, 
When the stars did gently peep, 
Reclining in the meadow, 
I 
tried to doze asleep ; 
When a 
vision of surpassing beauty, 
Then passed me by too soon, 
With form so slight and step so light, 
Where the little roses bloom. 
CHORUS. 
Her name she would not tell me, (Break.) 
'Twas love then that befell me, 
For the sweetest girl I 
knew; 
Arm in arm we wandered gaily, 
By the light of the silvery moon ; 
She said I'll meet you love again ; 
Where the little roses bloom. (Dance.) 
I 
was there on time next evening 
Ere the stars had shown their light; 
When tripping down the pathway 
She came with footstep slight ; 
Said she, 0 
let us wander 
All through the flowery dell; 
Said I, your wish is dear to me, 
Our tales of love let's tell. 
Her name, & c. 
We talked and chatted happy, 
The hours flew nimbly by; 
But when the hour of parting came, 
A 
tear was in her eye; 
I 
said it grieves me sorely, 
My love to part with thee; 
Just then I 
saw her handkerchief 
Marked A-N-N- I- E. 
Her name, &c, 
The Lakeman's Ball. 
GENTEEL SONG AND DANCE. 
Dedicated to the Lakeman Boat Club of Boston. 
Composed by JAMES R. 
W ALSH. 
Performed by W ALSH and KING. 
I 
sung to you some time ago 
About Miss Fannie Powers, 
And how we danced the polka too, 
And passed the merry hours. 
But now I've something new on hand, 
'Twill captivate you quite— 
'Tis of a 
charming little maid 
I 
met the other night. 
CTIORTJS. 
It was at the Lakeman's Ball, 
I 
chanced to make a 
call 
To pass away the dreary hours, 
I 
danced with her all night, 
For my heart was feeling light, 
I 
felt as if I 
bathed in golden showers. 
Quite carelessly I 
asked her name 
As by her side I 
sat, 
But when she placed her hand in mine 
My heart went pit- a-pat 
Her name I 
tried to find in vain, 
She blushed and hung her head, 
And when I 
asked her to be mine, 
Oh, yes ! was all she said. 
It was at the, &c. 
Each evening when the sun is down, 
I 
go to meet my fate, 
Down by the little garden where 
I 
meet her at the gate. 
And while the twilight gently falls 
We ramble through the dell, 
And tales of love and constancy, 
Unto my love I 
tell. 
It was at the &c. 
The Dancing Irish Pair. 
Words and Music by JAMES R. 
W ALSH. 
Performed by W ALSH and KING. 
We hail from dear old Ireland, that little isle so green, 
The birthplace of O'Connell, and the land of pure potheen, 
We couldn't easy rest at home, contented wouldn't be, 
But left the boys and girls behind, America to see. 
We landed here upon your shores, our prospects looked quite 
blue, 
We had but little money, and we had no work to do. 
We started in with courage, and we're known now everywhere, 
- 
By all the people far and near, this Dancing Irish Pair. 
CHORUS. 
Play up the music while we dance, we'll make the welkin ring, 
For dancing is a 
pastime, and we're happy while we sing, 
We never borrow trouble for we're gay and free from care, 
And known by people everywhere this Dancing Irish Pair. 
The colleens dear we've left behind are sighing every day, 
They long to see this Irish pair, from whom they're far away, 
The day we left we bade good bye and pledged our heart and 
hand— 
They'll welcome us when we return again to Paddy's land. 
Then come what will, whate'er betide, we'll dance the livelong 
day, 
So give us your applause kind friends to cheer us on our way, 
And when we do return again to America to see, 
We hope that in your kindness, we will not forgotten be. 
Play up the music, &c. 
Down in the Hazel Dell. 
Composed by JAMES R . 
W ALSH. Sung by W ALSH and KING. 
Dedicated to W. J. WALSH. 
As I 
strolled out one twilight eve, 
'Twas in the glad spring time, 
I 
met a 
pretty little maid 
With fairy form divine, 
She threw at me a 
loving glance, 
I 
felt the magic spell, 
'Twas love at sight, my heart felt light, 
Down in the hazel dell. 
CHORUS. 
With her I 
chatted gay and free, ( Break.) 
For she was just as pretty as could be, (Break.) 
And I 
see her every night at eight 
This maid I 
love so well. 
She stole my heart, we'll never part. 
Down in the hazel dell. 
As we ramble through the shady lane, 
Beneath the hawthorn tree, 
Her little hand is placed in mine, 
Her face is full of glee, 
And as she is soon to be my wife, 
I 
love her just as well 
As when we met, and ne'er forget, 
Down in the hazel dell. 
With her I 
@hatted, &c. 
Annie Dee. 
GENTEEL SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by JAMES R. 
W ALSH. 
Performed by W ALSH and KING. 
Good evening to you white folks, 
I've a 
story for your ear— 
'Tis of a 
fascinating little maiden, 
To me she is most dear. 
She is so captivating 
She would steal your senses quite. 
To gaze but once upon her form 
Would fill you with delight. 
CHORUS. 
But still with Annie Dee 
We'll wander o'er the lea, 
And we'll sing and dance 
The whole night long, 
We feel so merrily. 
With her I 
stroll out evenings 
To ramble through the dell, 
And pick the pretty violets 
I 
know she loves so well. 
But though we'll never marry 
With her I 
shall not part, 
For still I 
feel the cruel force 
Of Cupid's tiny dart. 
But still with Annie Dee, Ste. 
The Cottage by the Lane. 
GENTEEL SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by JAMES R. WALsii. 
Performed by W ALSH and IC /VG. 
When the stars are shining brightly 
In the azure dome above, 
And the dews are falling lightly 
I 
go to see my love. 
I 
meet her at our trysting, 
Near the Cottage by the lane, 
And while the hours are passing, 
Our love we tell again. 
CIIORUS. 
When the stars are shining brightly, 
An evening comes again, 
Then I 
haste to see my charmer, 
In the Cottage by the lane. 
Close beside a 
latticed window. 
In the arbor by the gate, 
When the rosy sun is setting, 
Impatiently I 
wait. 
When the door she opens softly, 
And welcomes me again, 
Then I 
feel like never leaving 
The Cottage by the lane. 
When the stars, &c. 
Pretty Jenny. 
A SERENADE. 
Composed by JAMES R. WALsH. Sung by WALsH and KING. 
Up in yonder latticed window, 
There a 
sweet face I 
can see, 
And I 
know ' tis pretty Jenny— 
She is waiting there for me. 
I 
will soon sit close beside her, 
In my pleasant old arm chair, 
And my arms shall form a 
circle 
Round her slender waist so fair. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet pretty maid, I 
see thy form divine, 
The beauty of the blushing rose can't equal that of thine. 
Sweet pretty maid, to me you're dearer far 
Then aught else in this world beside, you are my guiding star. 
Now the twilight gently deepens, 
And the dew is on the leaves, 
While the birdies hush their twitter 
From their nests beneath the eaves. 
It is time that I 
should meet you 
At our trysting by the oak, 
Where we've wandered in the past, love, 
And our words of love first spoke. 
Sweet pretty maid, & c. 
The Maid I 
Love so Well. 
Composed by JAMES R. 
W ALSH. Sung by W ALSH and KING. 
White folks listen to me now, 
While I 
sing to you a 
little song, 
'Tis of a 
maid I 
dearly love, 
I 
promise you I 
wont detain you long. 
I'll tell you how we flirted long ago, 
When first I 
met her at the well, 
And she promised me she would be mine, you know, 
This charming little maid I 
love so well. 
CHORUS. 
So we're going—to be married— 
In the shady little cottage by the dell, 
And merrily I'll while my time away, 
With this charming little maid I 
love so well. 
Long years have passed since first we met, 
Myself and this roguish little dear, 
But to me she has ever been the same, 
And that's the reason why I'm here. 
She promised she would meet me here at nine 
And tales of love to her I'll tell, 
While the stars shine bright I'll ramble round 
With this charming little maid I 
love so well. 
So we're going, & c. 
Lively Mokes. 
ECCENTRIC SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by JAMES R. 
W ALSH. 
Performed by W ALSH and KING. 
Here we are two lively mokes, 
Two genuine southern mokes, 
We came from way down south in Tennessee 
It was there we worked all day 
In the cotton fields so gay, 
'Till old massa went and set us darkies free. 
CHORUS. 
Oh the high times on the old plantation 
We will not forget where'er we go, 
As our hearts are feeling light, 
We have come out here to night, 
On purpose for to let you white folks know. 
When our work was o'er at night 
And the moon was shining bright, 
We'd sit beneath the porch above the door, 
With the bones and tambourine; 
Then we darkies could be seen, 
While we'd break it down upon the kitchen floor. 
Now I'm Free. 
ECCENTRIC SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by JAMES R. WALSH. 
Sung by WALSH and KING. 
Way down in Dixie, 
The place where I 
was born, 
Where I 
used to hoe the cotton, 
Sugar cane and corn, 
I'd rise up in the morning 
So happy, light and gay, 
I'd work out in the cotton fields 
In the sun all day. 
CHORUS. 
But massa set me free, and I'm so glad, 
It beats all the fun that ever I 
had, 
And now I'm free, I'll dance for you to- night, 
To please you one and all is my only delight. 
I 
had la kind old massa, 
The truth to you I 
tell, 
When I 
worked in Dixie, 
He always used me well, 
And there was good old missis 
As lovely as could be, 
No matter what I 
used to do, 
She never scolded me. 
But massa set me free, &c. 
Sweet Olive. 
GENTEEL SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by JAMES R. WaLsu. Sung by WALsn and KING. 
The dews now gently fall 
Sweet Olive 
While the birdies sing their call 
Dear Olive. 
I 
am waiting close beside 
The babbling brook, whose mirrored tide 
Oft your pretty face escried 
Sweet Olive. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet Olive, dear Olive, 
Tell me truly that you will become my wife. 
Sweet Olive, dear Olive, 
I 
adore you, you're the object of my life. 
Tell me do you love me still 
Sweet Olive, 
And your plighted troth fulfil 
Dear Olive. 
You have loved me in the past 
And you said your love would last, 
While my throbning heart beat fast 
Sweet Olive. 
Sweet Olive, &c. 
On your face I 
see a 
smile 
Sweet Olive, 
As you skip across the stile, 
Dear Olive. 
All my hopes have in you lain 
And I 
have not hoped in vain 
Tell me when you'll change your name 
Sweet Olive. 
Sweet Olive, &c.

Roving Blades. 
IRISH SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by JAMES R. WALsn. Performed by WALsit and KING. 
We're two roving Irish blades 
And from Paddy's land we've strayed, 
That dear old Emerald Isle we do adore, 
Sure we started you must know 
But a 
few short months ago, 
And landed lately on Columbia's shore. 
CHORUS. 
You will find us full of joy and pleasure, 
Our equals nowhere can be found, 
If you'll list to us the while 
We will for you the time beguile 
An show you how we dance in Dublin town. 
Now we work hard all the day, 
But at night we feel as gay 
As when we started in the morn, 
And while the stars shine bright, 
We will while away the night, 
And never quit our dancing till the dawn., 
You will find us, &c.

The Boys from where the Grass Grows Green. 
Written by W M. SCANLON, dedicated to the SPARKS BROTHERS, and sung 
by them with great success. 
Oh here we are, two Irish men, 
As you can plainly see; 
W e never weakened in the field, 
Wherever we may be, 
And with our swords in our hands 
We rush unto the foe— 
We're known to come out second-best 
Wherever we may go. 
CHORUS. 
For we're warriors bold from where the grass grows green, 
You can bet your life we're the best that ever was seen. 
When the cannons loudly roar we rush into the foe— 
We're the boys from where the grass grows green. 
(Repeat Chorus) 
They say no Irish n 
apply, 
But that we can't t -.-stand, 
For what would the A _.,: ricans do 
If it wasn't for Paddy's land ? 
And when we go into the battle 
We're never known to win, 
Unless the ranks are well filled out 
With the best of Irish men. 
For we're warriors bold, &c.

THE TRYSTING PLACE. 
Words and Music by W. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
CHAr.LEY. 
There's a 
lovely little maiden, 
Living down in yonder lane, 
Who has promised that she'd see me here to-night; 
And my heart with love is laden. 
Oh ! the sweet, delicious pain, 
That enraptured hearts experionce with delight ! 
And oh ! she is charming 
As the flowers in May ; 
Or as lovely as a 
peach in the fall ! 
And I 
could'nt see the harm in 
Giving her my love to-day. 
For I 
really think she's sweetest of them all 
CHORUS. 
She's my own—my heart's desire— 
Is my dark-eyed sweet Maria ! 
Oh !.tell me why you wink your eye, 
You roguish little butterfly ! 
As if you knew the reason I 
am here. 
And merrily from every tree, 
The pretty warblers sing to me! 
Because they know Maria loves me, dear! 
M ARIA. 
Now I 
wonder, where's Charley ? 
Surely, this is where he said 
That he'd meet me when the evening's shadows fell 
May be I 
have come to early ; 
Or, perhaps he has delayed, 
17 
Culling posies for me in the flowing dell. 
But I 
ieel just as happy 
As a 
sweet Magnolia flower! 
Or the Honeysuckle, hanging to the wall! 
When I 
saw his manly beauty, 
I 
was victim of its power ; 
So I 
cannot help but love him best of ! 
Cnonus. 
He's my own—my heart's desire— 
Ind he calls me his dear Maria! 
&c., &c. 
CHARLEY. 
Why, my pretty little primrose, 
I 
have heard your pretty song, 
Low and sweet as zephyrs passing thro' the trees ; 
Then a 
feeling in my heart arose 
That I 
had kept you long. 
And now, I 
hope that you'll forgive me, won't you, 
[ 
please? 
MARIA. 
Never ask me, Charley, darling! 
Long as you may ever live; 
And of your importunities I 
pray be done. 
CHARLEY. 
Yes! and now desist our quarrelling, 
Loving hearts must soon forgive ; 
And when our minds the same, two hearts mud boa 
[ 
as one.

The Cats On Our Back Fence. 
Copyrighted, 1579, by A. J. FISHER, 24 Vesey Street, N. Y. 
Written and sung by IIAnny CLARICE, Irish and Character Vocalist. 
I 
live in a 
great big tenement house on the floor up near 
the sky, 
For three months I 
have not slept a 
wink, and I'm afraid 
I'll die, 
There's a 
million cats around that yard and of course they 
have no sense, 
For they holler and cry and give me the guy, as they sit 
on our back fence. 
There's two cats called Maria and Tom, on them I've got 
my eye, 
Last night I 
shot my boot at them, they caught it on the fly, 
They sing " Baby Mine" and " Pinafore," and scream like 
a 
nagar winch, 
On the clothes line they do flying trapeze, those cats from 
our back fence. 
They eat the shingles from oft the house, the knobs from 
off the door, 
They collared the 'r,uttons of my pants and nailed my hat 
to the floe , 
They stoled Murphy's little baby, I 
mean the one that 
sqriiats, 
And they drew him through a 
knot hole that they made in 
our back fence. 
They hung a 
Chinaman with his tail, set fire to Murphy's 
mule, 
They made codfish hash out of a 
fine bullptip that belonged 
to Peter Toole, 
They robbed a 
butcher shop last night, the sausages were 
immense, 
They were full of Paris green, they poisoned those cats 
and they are buried under our back fence.

Jerry Slattery. 
As sung by PAT R OONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
Jerry Slattery was a 
tailor, he was ninety years of age, 
He had a 
son named Micky, a 
play actor on the stage. 
He'd play Romeo with his sister, for diamonds he'd give her 
pork and beans, 
Then little Michael Slattery would tear the bedclothes up for 
scenes. 
He is crazy, he is lazy, he broke his leg last week, 
He is always singing, always dancing, and playing tragedy in 
his sleep. 
He is always talking of Mary Anderson, he'd support her on 
the stage, 
Sure last night he got so crazy, we had to put him in a 
cage. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's little Michael Slattery stole his father's pants, 
He cut them up for tights to do a 
song and dance; 
When his mother was asleep he cut her hair off for a 
wig, 
Now little Micky Slattery is doing an acrobatic jig. 
He cut off his father's whiskers to play Hamlet and King Lear, 
Took a 
shot gun to his mother and made her walk off on her ear, 
He learned his sister dancing, cut off eleven of her toes, 
Now little Micky Slattery is singing tenor through his nose. 
For he's dramatic, he's lunatic, he is clean gone off his base, 
His father and his mother say he is a 
Celebrated Case, 
He says he takes the cake, as an actor he beats them all, 
Next week he plays Julius Caesar down at Solomon Duff's 
hall. 
Then it's little, &e.

ritten by Tom HARPER, and sung with great success by 
the Author, assisted by Miss JOSIE CAXTON, 
SHE. 
Old man, what is the matter, what makes you look so blue? 
Is it anything that this little girl has said or done to you ? 
If so, I 
feel so sorry, to make you look so sad, 
And if you have come home again, I'm sure you should 
be glad. 
HE. 
Oh no, ray child, it's nothing you've said or done to me, 
But I'm all alone in this world, without friend or family; 
And now I've nothing left me but for to pine and sigh, 
And hunt me out a 
resting place to lay me down and die. 
SHE. 
I'm sure you oughtn't to feel so, for I'm an orphan too, 
My father's gone for a 
soldier and donn'd thoa army blue ? 
I 
suppose that he is dead, for we've never receiv'd a 
line, 
And I 
know that he is in his grave way down in Caroline. 
HE. 
It's now about ten years ago I 
left old Aunty Sue; 
I 
ran away for a 
soldier, put on the army blue; 
I 
left here my dear old wife, and Susan was her name, 
And now I 
find that she is dead, I 
wish that I 
were the 
same.

I 
hope I 
don't intrude, 
Dress in this fashion, 
Pray don't think me rude; 
I'm leader of the style, 
That's plain enough to see, 
So if you want the fashion, 
Get pinned back just like me. 
ClIORIIS. 
All pinned back 
all pinned back! 
It's the style, you see; 
All pinned back! all pinned back! 
That's the style for me. 
Some people don't like it, 
And say you cannot walk, 
While dressed in a 
pinned-back, 
But that is foolish tang 
They are only jealous, 
And to that you agree, 
So if you like the fashion, 
Get pinned back just like me.

STOKES' 'VERDICT. 
Written and sung by W ILLIAM J. 
SCANLON. 
Arn.—"Nevcr Go rack on the Poor." 
If you '11 listen awhile, I'll sing you a 
song . 
About this "gloriousland of the free," 
And the " difference" I'll show ' twixt the rich and the poor, 
In a "trial by the jury," you see. 
If you've plenty of "stamps," you can hold up your head, 
And walk out from your own prison door, 
But they'll hang you up high if you've no friends or gold--
Let the "rich" go, but hang up the poor! 
Cuonus. 
In the trials for murder we ' ye had now-a-days 
The rich ones get off swift and sure, 
While they 've thousands to pay to the jury and judge, 
You can bet they'll go back on the poor! 
Let me speak of a 
man who's now dead in his grave---
A 
good man as ever was born--
.Tim Fisk, he was called, and his money he gave 
To the outcast the poor and forlorn. 
We all know he loved both women and wine, 
But his heart it was right, I 
am sure; 
Though he lived like a "prince" in a 
palace so fine, 
Yet he never went back on the poor! 
CHORUS. 
If a 
man was in trouble, Fisk helped him along 
To drive the " grim wolf" from the door ; 
He strove to do right, though he may have done wrong, 
But he never went back on he poor! 
Jim Fisk was a 
man, wore his heart on his sleeve,' 
No matter what people would say, 
And he did all his deeds (both the good and the bad) 
In ths, broad open light of the day.

THERE'S MAGIC IN A

As sung by the RICHMOND SisTErts.

Than to have, or be, a

Kiss Me Good Bye, Darling. 
As sung by Jona; C. 1.v.Acin, in San Francisco, Call. 
Gently the moon mounts the sky, 
Stars their nightwatch do keep, 
And why let those tears dim thine eye? 
Thine were not made, love, to weep. 
Look up and tell me you love me, 
Grief nearly breaks my poor heart, 
Smile once again in mine eye, 
Then kiss me, kis me, ere we part. 
CHORUS. 
Good bye, darling, goodbye, 
Do not grieve or miss me,

Good Enough For Me. 
ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE. 
As sung by McINTYRE k HEATH. 
As I 
strolled out the other day, 
A 
pretty girl I 
spied, 
She looked at me, I 
winkea at her, 
To sneak to her I 
tried. 
Across upon the other side, 
'Twas plain enough to see,

Good enough for me.

And do it mighty well. 
We must get married next week sure, 
Too soon it cannot be, 
I

Good enough for me. 
Good evening now, Maria. dear, 
I

How oft we sat together, 
Down by the running brook.

Good enough for me.

Kiss Mo. Love, Before I 
Go. 
Composed by \\rm. A. 
H UNTLEY, and sung by D AVE W AMBOLD, of the 
San Francisco Minstrels. 
I 
must leave you, love, to- morrow, 
Leave you here, to roam afar, 
And it gives me pain and sorrow, 
Since I 
ve learned how dear you are. 
Well I 
know you'll not be near me, 
As I 
wander to and fro; 
So, to comfort and to cheer me, 
Kiss me, love, before I 
go. 
CHORUS. 
Sweetest thoughts of thee I'm keeping, 
Smiles of thine should brightly glow ; 
Can I 
go and leave you weeping, 
Kiss me, then, before I 
go. 
You will sit here in the gloaming, 
As you have so oft before, 
But you'll wait in vain my coming 
To the little cottage door. 
For 'mid other scenes and pleasures 
I 
shall wander to and fro ; 
If your liert keep mine in treasure, 
Kiss me, love, before I 
go. 
Sweetest thoughts, &c, 
You may never sit beside me, 
Never hold my hand again ; 
Yet your sunny face will guide me, 
In the sunshine, in the rain. 
Where on earth I 
chance to wander, 
Still a 
memory sweet and low, 
Of the faded past I'll ponder— 
Kiss me, love, before I 
go. 
Sweetest thoughts, &c. 
SO 
DRIFTING DOWN THE CREEK.' 
Written for TONY PASTOR, by FRANk DUMONT. 
ONCE again I 
claim attention, 
While I 
sing these several lines, 
And a 
motto I 
will mention, 
One of course to suit the times. 
Somc folks we're ever meeting, 
Through the world they go on cheek, 
Yet we know in spite of smiling, 
They are drif.liig down the creek. 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
They are drifting down the creek. 
There's a 
frie.id who once had money, 
Now ' tis gone, he wants a 
lift, 
Make his days of darkness sunny, 
Never let him go adrift ; 
Even Grant., the nation's ruler, 
Distant cousins he will seek, 
" 
Dents ' and presents he will never, 
Send them drifting down the creek. 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
He will nev,r send them down the creek. 
Politicians too are needing, 
To keep open wide their eyes, 
The people's voice they'll soon be hearing, 
That will crush their plots and lies, 
Congress with its shares of railroad, 
Mobilier stocks as presents seek, 
Colfax, Ames and all those fellows, 
Send them drifting down the creek ; 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
Send them sailing down the creek. 
In conclusion I 
will mention, 
Should any powers ever strive, 
To tread upon this Yankee nation, 
They'll find the " boys in blue" alive, 
With the inem'ry of our chieftain, 
George Washington of him I 
speak, 
Columbia rushes like a 
whirlwind, 
And sends them drifting down the creek, 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
Send them scattering down the creek, 
GOLLY, AINT I

Sung by " LOTTIE," in her great character of " Topsey.• 
Oh! white folks, I

Where the cotton and the sugar cane grow,

And to work we singing all do go, 
Always singing, voices ' nging,

Paddle Your Boat Along. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
This world we live in is just like the sea, 
Travelers over its waters are we ; 
Try to be happy where'er you may be, 
If the wind should blow steady and strong. 
It's no use to grumble, to growl or complain, 
You can't stop the wind nor you can't stop the rain, 
After a 
storm we have sunshine again— 
So paddle your boat along. 
CIIORUS. 
Always try to be happy and gay, 
Let this world jog on as it may; 
Always do right and never do wrong, 
As you paddle your boat along. 
There are people we meet who always seem glad, 
Others who always seem solemn and sad. 
They want all the good but won't share the bad ; 
Now I 
think that decidedly wrong. 
There are good things enough in this world for us all, 
If we be content with a 
share of the small. 
Tho' little our lot, some have nothing at all, 
So paddle your own boat along. 
Always try to be happy, &c. 
Don't be down-hearted, though breakers may roar, 
Or if your boat be cast on the shore; 
You are sure to get into smooth water once more 
If you pull steady and strong. 
Don't pull too slow nor yet pull too fast, 
But always make way for a 
friend to get past. 
The harbor of safety you'll reach well at last, 
If you paddle your boat along. 
Always try to be happy, &c.

Summer Flowers. 
Sung with immense success at Harry Miner's by ED. FAVOR, of FAVOR 
and SHIELDS. 
See how fast from Heaven, mother, 
Falls the feathery flakes of snow, 
Weaving white and pure a 
mantle 
For the fruitful earth below. 
Ere they melt I 
leave you, mother, 
Leave for ever this world of pain; 
For something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flowers again. 
CHORUS. 
Do not weep, dear loving mother, 
Sad am I 
to cause you pain; 
But something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flowers again. 
How I 
loved alone to wander, 
In the happy days long flown, 
O'er fields and meadows fair to gather 
Bright-hued blossoms freshly blown. 
Soon beyond the rippling river, 
Winding onwards o'er the plain, 
The bud.; may burst, but I 
shall never 
Uather them for you again. 
Do not -.

Yellow Clarionette. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTEL. 
I'll sing to you some woes of mine, 
About a 
gal so fair, 
With a 
hump-backed bunion on her nose, 
And brick bat colored hair. 
loved her as I 
love my life, 
And she was gay you bet, 
But a 
Dutchman used to play for her 
On a 
yellow clarionette. 
Cuonus. 
He said he loved her much, 
And spoke Italian Dutch, 
And every time I 
caught him there, 
You bet I 
made him dust, dust, dust. 
He played for her night and day, 
And murdered Old Dog Tray, 
And paralyzed the people for 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Clothilda was the maiden fair, 
And Fritz the Dutchman bold, 
lie told her of his bully home 
And of his wealth untold. 
He played for her one afternoon, 
And got up to K 
flat, 
He blowed the brains out of his head, 
And spoilt his Sunday cravat. 
YELLOW CLARIONETTE. 
(Continued.) 
CHORUS. 
This caught the maiden dead, 
For it almost turtled her head, 
lie asked her if 1-he'd go with him, 
They to the parson fled. 
He married her on sight, 
I 
found it out that night, 
I 
drank twelve quarts of oyster soup, 
And went to bed quite tight. 
'When I 
came to on the next day, 
I 
thought my heart would break, 
I 
tried to starve myself to death, 
With a 
whorticberry cake. 
I 
grabbed an iron boot jack, 
And I 
tried to cut my throat, 
I 
went alone to a 
beer saloon 
For a 
wooden overcoat. 
CHORUS. 
I 
saw the gal last week, 
And she's got lots of cheek, 
She plays a

With that hump-backed freckled beat. 
She says old man don't fret, 
I've got two boys you bet, 
And they are marked down 
To the middle of the nose 
With a

YOU MAY LOOK, BUT YOU MUSN'T 
TOUCH. 
Sung with overwhelming success, by HARRY MoYraouE. 
(Music of this song car. be obtained of SPEAR & DEasnoFr, 
717 Broadway, New York, Harry Montague's sole publishers.) 
When was t. boy, a 
mischievous elf, 
I'd a 
very bad balk' ot helping myself; 
My motile' put everything out of my way, 
And well I 
remember these words she would say: 
CIIORIJS. 
You may look, but you musn't touch, 
Musn't touch, keep your hands off, 
repeat. 
You're inclined to be a 
little forward, 
Now don't be so rude. 
At eight years of age, although not a 
fool, 
I 
went every day, of course, to my school. 
I 
romped with the girls, and would not let them be, 
Sc the school teacher gave the old lecture to me: 
You may look, etc. 
When I 
grew a 
young man, I 
loved a 
sweet maid, 
And although she loved me, she was rather too staid. 
I 
dared not embrace Ler, or ask for a 
kiss, 
If I 
did, the reply from my love would be this: 
You may look, etc 
When we were engaged, r ;aid, No one could blame, 
So her scruples in that way I 
soon overcame. 
This dear little darling, I 
married one day, 
When I 
now want a 
kiss, you will not hear her say: 
You may look, etc. 
AIR: "Hand in Hand We Wander." 
Written by EDDIE SANDS, and 
sung by KEATING and SANDS. 
You tell me that you love me 
With a 
passion pure and high 
As the heavens that bend above me 
When the day-god warms the sky; 
You vow that you will cherish 
My memory whilst you live, 
That you will let no feeling perish 
While you've life-blood yet to give. 
You say that you are truthful 
As aught beneath the sun, 
That you will let no ivy ruthful 
My flowers of bliss o'errun; 
Yet of hearts I'm an inspector, 
And I 
know thine, link by link, 
At its founts of bubbling nectar 
Any one that will may drink. 
M ORAL. 
And although you may replenish 
It for me, my dainty lip 
Will never taste the remish 
From the goblet others

Each day seems like a 
year to me 
Each minute like an hour, 
I 
often put salt into my tea 
So strong is wedlock's power. 
The people tell m I 
am mad; 
'Tis not any way, 
Oh, jumping Mose! aint I 
glad 
She's named the wedding day. 
Cno:—Wednesday is my wedding day, &c.

Farewell to Billiards, Bagatelle, 
And every kind of sport, 
Farewell to Champagne and Moselle, 
And sundry drops of short. 
The reason why I 
say good bye 
To all these capers gay, 
Is because I've better fish to fry, 
Upon my wedding day. 
Cno:—Wednesday is my wedding day, Ia.

Oh here we are a 
lively pair, 
And we sing and we dance all day ; 
We are happy when we are singing, 
For it drives de blues away. 
We work down in de cotton field, 
And we plant de sugar cane ; 
We are as happy as two pretty little birds, 
Me and bright-eyed sweet Jerusha Jane. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Jerusha, you're de sweetest creature ! 
Come with me and see the preacher. 
Oh, yes! we will go down and get married 
When the daylight is on the wane. 
We will sing and dance to please you all— 
Me and bright-eyed sweet Jerusha Jane. 
(Sym.) 
(SYrn.) 
Oh, we please de white folks, 
When we dance and sing de old plantation songs, 
While working in de field together, 
How de time it glides along. 
Oh, Jerusha and I 
will soon be married, 
And den to you she will explain 
How I 
loved my pretty little sugar plum, 
She is my bright-eyed sweet Jerusha Jane. 
Oh, Jerusha! & c. 
Hours of Pleasure. 
Published by permission of GEO. Motimmux, Brooklyn, 
'Twas at a 
ball I 
first met my girl, 
The fairest in the land ; 
She had pearly teeth and a 
dimpled chin, 
And a 
little slender hand. 
She skipped around in mazy waltz 
As graceful as a 
fawn ; 
When the dance was o'er I 
asked Irene 
To walk out on the lawn. 
CHORUS. 
We sat by the brook and the stars shone bright, 
And we whispered words of love on that summer night. 
So we walked and talked till it grew quite late, 
But I 
know she has my heart ; 
Then I'll bless the day when we get wed, 
And from her I'll never part. 
Next eve we met, near a 
running stream, 
And I 
walked close by her side ; 
I 
told her then how I 
loved her so, 
And she said she'd be my bride. 
How happy I'll be all the while 
When Irene is my wife. 
We will have a 
cot by a 
babbling brook, 
And we'll settle down for life. 
We sat by the brook, &c.

A 
Helping Hand. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Respectfully presented to BILLY MAvo by CHAS. P. 
DONNELEY. 
There are many sayings true 
That are known to me and you, 
Tho' perchance we have forgotten them, and yet, 
When a 
person has got means, 
How easy then it seems 
That the sufferings of mankind we should forget. 
And now that pay is small, 
Some can get no work at all; 
Many honest men are starving through the land. 
So it's now I 
bring advice, 
For which I 
nothing charge in price, 
And my motto is—Lend a 
Helping Hand. 
CHORUS. 
Then if riches you would gain, 
Or fame you would attain, 
Bear in mind this noble maxim I 
command, 
And believe me when I 
say 
That in the end you'll find ' twill pay, 
If you always try to lend a 
helping hand. 
First we'll take an orphan boy, 
He's no home he can enjoy. 
Ever since he can remember, he will say 
That his home has been the street, 
In winter cold and summer heat, 
Because his parents in a 
drunkard's grave did lay. 
Now I 
think you will agree 
With the idea held by me, 
That that poor boy should be allowed to stand, 
47 
A HELPING HAND. 
Continued. 
And in spite of croakers all, 
Who would his parents' sin recall, 
Every one should lend a 
helping hand. 
HORUS. 
For though it strange appears, 
Perhaps in course of years, 
That boy may be a 
credit to this land, 
If some one with kindly heart 
Would nobly take his part, 
And extend to that poor boy a 
helping hand. 
There is still another case, 
With which I'll bring you face to face, 
Tho' its now we see it almost every day. 
'Tis when a 
widow, poor and old, 
Who has got no gold, 
In the street she's turned, her rent she cannot pay; 
While the grasping landlord he 
Looks on in silent glee, 
Throw her things in the street is his command. 
Oh what a 
world of good 
Some one could do if they would, 
By saying I'll lend to her a 
helping hand. 
CHORUS. 
Now my little song is done, 
Tho' its true I've caused no fun; 
I 
hope you won't forget my motto grand, 
And believe me when I 
say 
That in the end you'll find ' twill pay, 
If you always try to lend a 
helping hand.

Beneath the Old Oak Tree. 
Words and music by CHARLES JERONIE. To my little friend, PAULINE 
AMES. 
In a 
little cottage down the road, 
Close by a 
running stream, 
Dwells a 
maiden fair, wi01 f"olden hair, 
Her age is sweet sixteen. 
How many happy hours I've passed 
Beneath the old oak tree, 
With this little darling by my side, 
So happy, gay, and free. 
CHORUS. 
But the happy day will soon be here ( Sym.) 
When I 
shall wed this little dear ; ( Sym.) 
The marriage bells will toll so sweet, 
And the little birds sing with glee ; 
To remind us of the hours we've passed 
Beneath the old oak tree. ( Dance.) 
Now when I've wed this little me_i6, 
And she's my darling wife, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream 
I'll settle down for life. 
With this little maiden by my side 
I'll ever happy be, 
And we'll often pass the hours away 
Beneath the old oak tree. 
Drunkard's Lone Child, 
OUT in this gloomy night sadly I 
roam, 
I've no mother now, no friends, no home, 
Nobody cares for me, no one would cry, 
Even if poor little Bessie should die. 
Barefoot and tired I've wandered all da), 
Asking for work, but I'm too small, they ,!,tty. 
On the damp ground I 
must now lay my head() 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
Cuomo's. 
Mother, why did you leave in3 alone, 
Within) one to love me, no friends and no burnt., 
Dark is the night, the storm rages wild, 
God pity Bessie, the Drunkard's Lone Child. 
We were so happy till father drank rum, 
Then all our trouble and. sorrow begun. 
Mother grew paler and wept every day, 
Baby and I 
were too hungry to play. 
Slowly they faded, and one summer night 
Found their sweet faces all silent and white. 
And with big tears slowly dropping I 
said, 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
Oh! if some temp'rance man only could find 
Poor, wretched father and speak very kind, 
If they could stop him from drinking, why then 
I 
should feel very happy again. 
Is it too late ? 
Men of temp'rance, please try, 
For little Bessie will soon starve and die. 
All the day long I've been begging for bread— 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead.

As my coal black Sal. (Dance) 
Oh, de sun gone down behind de cliff, 
And de moon am shining bright, 
And de nigs have all gone down de road, 
Dere's a

With their merry voices shouting, 
They make the whole ground shake, 
But when it comes to dancing, 
You bat we take de cake. 
De old folks are gwine too, 
And everthing goes well, 
And de niggers are preparing 
For their sorrows to dispel, 
When we think of this meeting, 
You bet we never sigh, 
So strike -up the music, 
For de time am drawing nigh.

Go to Sleep my Little Darling. 
Published by permission of COLLINS & BUXTON, Portland, Me. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest on mother's loving breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
When within your cradle rest ; 
Far above the starry heavens, 
They are looking down on you, 
So repose, my precious darling, 
Close your tiny eyes of blue. 
CHORUS. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest your head on mother's breast, 
And the angels will protect you, 
When within your cradle rest. 
Far a-down the dewy meadow, 
All the daises are asleep, 
And the birdies in the branches 
Also are in slumber deep. 
But in Eden far above us, 
Angel eyes are open wide, 
And you are as safe, my darling, 
, Ls if they were at your side. 
Go to sleep, &c. 
In the early morning, darling, 
Little robin in the tree 
Will awake you from your slumber, 
When he sings his merry glee. 
Then I'll take you to my bosom, 
Till the glimmer on the plain 
Tells us that the sun is shining, 
And the day nas come again. 
Go to sleep, &c.

When I'm dead and gone from you darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above; 
To him who my soul will save. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I

See that my grave's kept green. 
CIIOEUS. 
Oh, the days will come to you darling, 
When or. earth no more I'll be seen, 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Will you keep me, love, in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
While other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinicing of the days that Lave been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you,

Grandmother's Chair. 
Written by JOHN READ, and sung with great success as the latest hit of 
the season at HARRIGAN it HART'S Theatre Comique by EDWIN BARRY. 
Music at E. H. HARDING'S, 229 Bowery, 
Copyrighted. 
My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pounds, 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You can then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, &c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life, 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abrood would roam but each night would stay at home, 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found, 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair ? 
And how they titter'd, & c.

I'll Bet You a 
Dollar You Don't, 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
Does any one know what I'm going to say ? 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
If I 
lose the wager, will any one pay, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Gay bachelors say they shall never take wives, 
For as each in his way to be happy contrives, 
They mean to keep single the rest of their lives. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
Find an Irish election without any row, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't, 
Or a 
sin l 
who objects to a 
mistletoe bough, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some years of experience teaches me this— 
That from seven to ninety both Mrs. and Miss 
May refuse you this ancient excuse for a 
kiss. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
You may see vaccination a 
thing of the past, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
And heavy taxation abolished at last, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
You may see old John Bull dwindle down to a 
calf, 
And his provender nothing but foreigners' chaff. 
You may see all the ladies too quiet by half, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some ignorant croakers wear visages long, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
And say that to visit amusement is wrong, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
Though to succor distress they can never afford, 
Above human vices they always have soared, 
Still somehow they know every move on the board, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't? 
A married man often tries to prove cock-o'-the-walk, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar he don't. 
If he tries to sleep when his wife wants to talk, 
I 
shall bet him two dollars he don't. 
So all you young girls, please attend to this verse, 
And go and get married for better or worse, 
And two little armfuls you may have to nurse, 
Won't bet a 
dollar you don't.

Dwells a

It's of this little dear I 
will tell you, 
With a 
dashing style that is very rare. 
-You should ee her for she is bewitching, 
When she is dressed up in her suit of light blue, 
Alai looking up says "now, ain't I 
Pretty?" 
Tell Inc s

When she,stands before her mirror, 
And I 
her try to please, 
Then I'll tell her that I

And then she'll coax and tease, 
Then she'll look up with a 
smile, she's so witty ! 
If you love me, tell me, ain't your darling pretty." 
The other morning we went out walking, 
And took a 
promenade upon the green, 
And I 
only wish you could have seen us, 
Sucli a 
gay sight never before was seen. 
tell you the Lids they all me envy, 
And I 
so very unconcerned do seem, 
Yes, I 
think I 
heard " oh ! ain't she pretty?" 
A dozen times upon that vilage green. 
Chorus. 
But still these happy days are passing, 
And soon will be the day she'll be my bride, 
Oh! how dear I 
love the little darling, 
As through the future happy years we'll glide. 
To see her you'd envy and not pity, 
For all my cherished hopes I've centered there, 
The first thing you'd say " oh ! ain't she pretty," 
With her flowing locks of bright golden hair.

On which was wrote— 
Her name was Beckey Gildersleeve, 
Her fader he was rich, 
Her mutter keeps a 
bier serloon 
Behind McCoomb's Ditch, 
I 
am going to meet this German girl 
Next Sunday afternoon, 
I'll treat her to a 
dozen bier's, 
And catch her very soon.

(Break.) 
I'll put on me Sunday clothes 
And won't I 
look gallus, 
With my swallow- tail coat, 
Double-breasted in the back, 
I'll pay five cents on the steam locomotive 
And to her house I'll ride on the railroad track ; 
I 
expect there will be a band, ( Break.) 
At the depot when I 
land. 
To escort me to my Beckey's house, 
'Ind then her folks will see, 
Or else a 
half a 
dozen clubs 
Be waiting there for me. 
And if I 
don't get her consent, 
I 
know I 
turn a 
loon, 
And cut my throat with a 
bar of soap; 
That will end me very soon.

The N. Y. Evening Mail writer 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FislIER's, 98 Has 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the-bad habit of 
flirting." Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and inititq the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: ' We have lately seen a 
neat filtle 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FisnErt, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operand! of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesktate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which miclit have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi.

phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
