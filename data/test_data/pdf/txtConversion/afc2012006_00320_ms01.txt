Thomas Nolan Lightsey Jr. Born in Biloxi, MS June 22, 1923. Went to school and 
graduated from high school in 1942. Joined the merchant marine and went to boot camp 
in 1943. Suffered from asthma but did not tell merchant marine employers about it. 
Passed the physical and went to boot camp in Florida for three months. Caught first 
tanker in June, 1943.

Merchant Marine is not a fighting organization, but deliver all the products all over the 
world. First tanker had diesel fuel to the Tanga islands submarines. At the end of WW 2 
was on a tanker with aviation gasoline for the navy planes on their way to Japan. Role in 
the beginning was ordinary seamen, lowest position in the deck department. Got 
promoted to able seamen. After 18 months qualified to go to officer school, went to 
Maritime Officers school in Connecticut. Graduated with third mates license in May 
1945. Then got on a tanker and went to the South Pacific.

Raised in Biloxi, after depression. Was poor student in school. After war, everyone went 
back to college. Loved being a third mate, stayed on ship. Four years later, made captain. 
Process - captain, chief mate (exec officer), Second mate (navigating officer), third mate, 
have to spend at least a year before rising through the ranks again. During the war, 
promotions were given out in six months. Had masters license at 26. Stayed in the 
Merchant Marine till became a Houston Pilot. 11 months trip out in the Persian Gulf to 
China and Italy. Enjoyed seeing the world. Became chief mate when company acquired 
three new ships. 50-60 ships, chosen to be chief major under construction of brand new 
chemical ships. Carried highly volatile cargo, stylene, benzene, zylene etc. Could cause 
cancer if you breathe it in. Have led a charmed life.  
 
0:08:20 
Move from 3rd mate to 2nd mate and the 2nd mate is a navigator. Need to layout the 
charts for the course over the next 24 hours. Was a poor student in school, so had to study 
 
 
that much harder for next upgrade in license. "Mentors" on board ships taught Morse 
Code and Semaphone which helped in getting the upgrade in license. People were glad to 
help. Enjoyed every position.  
Being a pilot is very different.

Pilots own their own business and make the rules. Dispatcher receives the call. On for 15 
days and off for 15 days. While on call, cannot socialize. Either working or sleeping. 
Pilot boat goes alongside the ship, pilot climbs a Jacob ladder up to the main deck and a 
mate escorts him up to the bridge. After introductions and knowing the particulars, pilot 
is then in command, makes all the decisions.  
safety is very important.  
 
0:16:05 
Channel is only 400 ft wide. Depending on the length, breadth and draft of ship, a certain 
speed needs to be determined to stop. Depending on how deep the ship is - the more 
water it displaces as it comes closer to the bank. When two ships meet it called Texas 
Chicken. Bank forces the ship back to the center of the channel. Channel is much wider 
now.  
 
00:18:37 
Had a collision with another pilot at 2am. Ripped a  hole that was 30 ft in the side of the 
ship. Was a ground boy before that. Memory that lasts a lifetime. Another incident, not so 
bad. Call them incidents instead of collisions.  
 
00:20:24 
Often go on ships not knowing who the captain is. Would meet for the first time. Had a 
cheat-book with questions in a language the captain was familiar with. That way could 
talk to him directly and did not need an interpreter. Captain would like that extra touch.  
 
00:22:40 
Nowadays have to have a marine background to be a pilot. Half blue water men and half 
brown water men. Half steam ship people and half two boat people. Three year 
apprentice program.  
 
00:24:15 
Houston to be one of the most dangerous ship channels in the world. Pilots have a closed 
shop. No competition. Commission from the state of Texas, every port has to have pilots. 
It is good living and it is top of the Marine profession to become a pilot. Port commission 
is the Pilot Commission. They set the rate for raise, increase etc.  
 
00:26:18 
 
 
Getting into the Port commission is very difficult. Can have a lot of credentials but very 
few are chosen. Was the 53rd pilot since its inception in Houston. Very closed 
organization. Need to have friends in the commission. Wanted to be a pilot because it 
was less traveling and as a family man wanted to exercise that option.  
 
00:29:09 
Wife's sister had married a man from Boston, so she moved to Boston. In 1947, were 
home at the same time. Married in Biloxi. Was running offshore and moved up to New 
Jersey . Had two children there. While trying to be a pilot, moved from New Jersey to 
Pasadena. Had six children. Got another job as an investor. Cruises with family.  
 
00:33:15 
Worked on tankers for the whole career, sacrificed safety for pleasure. Company had 
chemical ships initially. Worked on those too.  
 
00:34:41 
Merchant Marine is a private company. After the war, the companies took their ships 
back from the Maritime association.  Worked with Keystone. Rose through the ranks. 
Had the best of both worlds. Married the same woman, had the best job.  
 
00:36:12 
Liberty ship - ships that were built in WW 2 to make trips to carry goods. Ugly and small 
and quite a few were built, slow ships. At sea from 1946 -1953.   
 
00:38:26 
Background from ship or tug does not make that much of a difference. The person's 
personal skills counts. Test of fortitude. Now people have to have a maritime degree 
through a 4 year course.  
 
00:39:50 
Liberty company offered a job, NJ was too cold. Reason behind moving to Houston. Was 
operating a new chemical tanker. Would come back every 10-12 days to Houston. When 
wanted to leave the North East, made a list of the 27 pilots and found out their hobbies. 
Would talk to the pilots for hours. Had studied their hobbies.  
 
00:44:09 
Shifted close to Deer Park. Bought a lot in 1958 and built the house.  
 
00:46:28 
Would take various products from the Shell refinery and bring it to various distribution 
centers on the east coast. Pilots own the business and the boats. Have 35 employees 
Crews for the boat  and Marine Superintendent in Galveston, brand new office in Deer 
 
 
Park, 8-10 office staff, executive committee makes all the decisions and everyone meets 
once every 2-3 months. Everyone is equal.  
 
00:49:10 
Pool all the money, take the expenses out and what is left is divided equally among the 
pilots. No seniority system. (Shows a picture and explains) 
 
00:50:31 
Now pilots work like gentleman. Earlier used to work like dogs. There was always a ship 
waiting to be brought in. Have included minority, women. When one job is done, 
guaranteed 12 hours off. If two ships are handled, guaranteed 18 hours off. Wonderful 
communication systems. Can tell the depth, what it is, they converse. Safety has 
improved a great deal.  All in constant contact. Port of Houston has a lot of room to 
expand. Key to progress. Houston has tripled in size.  
 
00:52:47 
Working conditions have improved. Communication - everyone has a laptop to figure out 
information 
 
00:54:11 
Fog. On from October to April. Safety guidelines in place now. Incidents have greatly 
reduced.  
 
00:56:31 
If there is an incident, PBRC - Pilot review board used to look into it. Now industry and 
port get involved. .One little incident can be blown out of proportion. Reason behind 
everyone being so safety conscious.  
 
00:58:12 
Would interact with the different mates. One of the mates worked with the telegraph. 
Used to communicate with the engine room.  
 
1:00:00 
Would get on a different carrier every time. Ranged from a tug boat to a loaded super 
tanker, car carrier, barge etc. Did not make any difference. If the boat wanted to come 
into Houston, would bring it in.  Big sea going tugs and barges were a whole different 
genre to learn to operate. No experience in that. 
 
1:02:34 
Quit being on the sea to spend more time with family but as a pilot had to work holidays. 
Christmas, holidays, birthdays, anniversaries. One Christmas went to work at 2 am and 
son in law is a Marine Colonel. It is all about mind over matter. Did not like it but had to 
do it. Built the house in such a way so could sleep during the day. Jobs used to take 6-8 
 
 
hours. Now, because of docks down in Bayport and Barber's Cut, can do it in 2-3 hours. 
Before Loading grain ship out of city docks would entail an 8 hr job. no relaxing till out 
of the bay. Constantly changing course and the speed of the ship. Worked for 15 days and 
off for 15 days. Pilots own the business. so preferred to work like dogs instead of hiring a 
lot more and splitting the money.  
 
1:07:57 
Pilot room. To lay down and rest. Got so tired of eating fish heads and rice. Was not 
much into eating Sushi but that was what was available on Oriental ships.  
 
1:09:50 
Hidden parts of the channel. As Presiding Officer, any new Dock had to be 225 ft from 
the near bottom edge of the channel. Before that docks were built right on the edge of the 
channel. Surge from the ship approaching the channel can break the ship lose. Have to 
stop and drift by. When docks were built with the new regulation, could have more speed 
without tearing the ship away from the dock. Was really proud of the achievement. 
Turnin Basin out in Brady island. Got the space to officially turn the big car carriers etc. 
Did a few things that was very proud of while was Presiding Officer.  
Was on the review committee to discipline pilots and did not like that.  
 
1:12:11 
If a pilot has an incident, he has to go before 2 groups and the presiding officer and 
explain his side of the story. The committee would decide on the disciplinary action to 
take. Had this one pilot who was constantly having problems. Lot of damage. Was a 
strong disciplinarian.  
 
1:13:45 
Review board had two groups. White hats and black hats. Knew everyone's capabilities 
as work with someone constantly for 15 days. Terminology - nicknames.  
Used to teach down at Galveston College. Used to teach Bridge Resource Management, 
how to conduct a watch on the bridge. Used to tell students, "looking at the best ship pilot 
you have ever seen." 
Used to be able to answer any questions related to the ship.  
 
1:18:10 
Battleship Texas. Could get it out of the mud. There was a big crowd gathered there. Had 
shut the whole channel down. Said later, "The Japanese couldn't sink the Texas, the 
Germans couldn't sink the Texas, looks like the timelines (?) are going to sink the Texas." 
as a Pilot, brought in one of the biggest ships into the channel. National Defender - large 
tanker that was to load grain. Brought it in with another Captain. Took up all the turning 
basin. Just couldn't turn it. Big challenge. Took a little bit more of expertise. Was a 
challenge. Tag teaming. Total concentration. Get too tired. It is safer this way. Was raised 
 
 
on the water but other than sailing, did not have much exposure to the water. Retired in 
1993. Improving almost constantly. Send pilots to school.
