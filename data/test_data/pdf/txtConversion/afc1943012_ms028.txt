April 28, 1943, letter from B.A. Botkin to H.M. Bond
April 28, 1943 Dr. Horace Bond Fort Valley State College Fort Valley, Ga.
Dear Dr. Bond:
Thank you for the eight records, which arrived in good condition. Of these I like best the
records by Bus Ezell and Buster Brown. Could we have more or them? The Davies Hill
School Chorus and the Middle Georgia Four are less interesting.
It is agreeable to us to extend the project to the end of May. Perhaps this will permit
Dr. J on es am to use some of his vacation time for recording. According to preliminary
statements of Dr. J on es' am plan for work on the Rosenwald Fellowship, he had some
interesting ideas for the study of wartime folklore in central and southern Georgia. I should
like him to continue along these lines and, if possible, write me more specifically as to the
possibilities for the next month.
We shall shortly send you duplicates of the records. Our engineer notes that they contain
a number of skips due to twisted threads, and would like to know how they occurred and
whether they can be avoided.
With best wishes,
Faithfully, B.A.Botkin, Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Song
