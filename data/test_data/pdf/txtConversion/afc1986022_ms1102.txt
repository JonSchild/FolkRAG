Q. Tell me a brief history about your son again. I wished I had gone ahead and started
tape recording at the beginning.
A. Well, I'll just say this is <unintelligible text>, my one and only child. And when he
finished high school we had always planned to send him to Princeton, but his father had
been called back into the service as a reserve officer and was stationed in Washington, so
we decided to send him to the Citadel Military College in Charleston, South Carolina. At
Christmas they were beginning to draft these 17-year-old boys, and his father was going
overseas and he said he wanted <unintelligible text> to be trained before he went. And so
he got an appointment to West Point and he entered West Point at 17 years of age and
graduated in the three-year course.
Q. That's marvelous.
A. <unintelligible text> He chose to enter the Air Corps and at one time he served 3 years
in Japan right up on that northern part where had we needed to send people into Russia
<gap> he would have been one of the first to go, you see, he was kept on standby. And
at one time he was the youngest jet pilot in the world; and after the war was over, and
he came home he decided he wanted to study law. So he went to Texas University Law
School and was when he graduated it was with the highest honors of any law student
that had ever been there, really, and he was the honor graduate of the world in law Now,

here's my little nostalgia corner right here; that tells a lot about my background. This is
my wedding picture and that is an old family servant named <unintelligible text> and she
worked for my grandmother and there were, let's see, about four <unintelligible text>
families in Huntsville and Ann would so everywhere there was a house party in the whole
connection, on a new baby, or a wedding <gap> the night I was married I <gap> reception.
She says to my mother: I wish I could have my picture taken <gap> and mama said: come
right along and she posed that way herself.
Q. That's marvelous.
A. And this is my husband <taken?> at that time. You know he was acting president of
the school up here when he was called back into the service. And those are our wedding
flowers up there <gap> his boutonniere and flowers from my bouquet, so you see how
sentimental I am, and here's a picture of my son, rather recent picture, and that's his
namesake
Q. You can certainly see that he has a fine look about him that you can see in there in both
pictures.
A. <gap> made that portrait in Dallas; this is a copy of it. When we left, when he retired
10 years ago, they wanted to give us a gift and I said oh no I don't want <gap> and I don't
want anybody giving us a present and they
said: Well, would you let us <unintelligible text> to keep <gap> There's a man in Dallas, an
artist who takes pictures of these <gap> ours is a copy; they have the original and it's in

little memorials <gap> And then I tell you more about this <gap> 2 years ago <gap> to
the Court of <gap> Appeals and he was doing beautifully in this old law firm office. But
he was quite entranced with the idea of the service to his country and that was taken
actually when he was sworn in by George Greenhill of the Texas Supreme Court who was
a personal friend and I won't take too long with all this cause
Q. Take all the time you want; this is marvelous.
A. These are the pictures when we were young. That's my child when he was 2 years old,
ain't he beautiful?
Q. He is; he's a beautiful baby.
A. <gap> and I'm the biggest sissy in the world which has caused some problems...
Q. Well, wasn't he your pride and joy? Look at that!

husband, my son, and my oldest grandson, <unintelligible text>. This is my son and his
father there in the picture.

I am; there's his boy announcement that Tiffany made and I have this little so I put the
heart by it. And that's a little picture of me in my wedding dress. Let's see, <gap> talking
about burning electricity. . . <gap> They said so much about it. Anyway, I like <gap> This

to hang up in the Gibbs office, and this is his <unintelligible text> when he was little, isn't
he darling?
Q. Yes.
A. Did you ever hear of Philip Gibbs, do you know Mrs. Philip Gibbs?
Q. That is the Gibbs that is in the history of the town?
A. Well, <unintelligible text> is about 10 years older than Tommy, and he was a Yale
graduate and during the war he was in the Air Force and he died 2 years ago with cancer,
but he was a great favorite of mine, and his family brought this picture to me after he died.
Wasn't he a darling + handsome?

portrait. That portrait hangs in the bank over here and also up in the Gibbs

another sentimental gesture. This is a bedroom, as you can see, and this a dresser was in
my grandmother's family. Oh, I just don't know how old it is, and this is a big bed and table
I bought to with that dresser <gap> She was married to my father's older brother. She was

Q. White <Cable?> was the name of <gap>
A. White
Q. When was this torn down?
A. Well, after my mother died which was in 1950; and we hated to do it but you know
we all had our homes and we couldn't bear the thought of doing anything with it like
apartments, anything to keep it up; and we just didn't want anybody else to live in it.
Q. Yes.
A. And we took it down and <gap> father was a lawyer in South Carolina; and his mother
came from a very fine family in Virginia
Q. Well that is very nice.
A. Well you <unintelligible text> We'd go to my grandmother's house on Christmas night
and her house was perfectly beautiful. It was ornate, but it wasn't too ornate and she had
this enormous reception hall. It was as big as all this part of my house and <unintelligible
text> there were two double parlors that opened into the dining room, and in the front
parlor she always had a christmas tree great big with presents for all of us. And then in
those days it was really just like the old South and we had just a lot of excellent servants
and we had such a fine relationship

with Aunt Louisa, you know that was typical; and Louis, the man who milked the cows and
then he would drive put on a tall hat and drive my mother's carriage. It was just like the old
South.
Q. Ah, that must have been nice.
A. And on Christmas night they would serve a 2-course supper to everybody, all of us; and
<gap> Robinson and I used to get together and sit on the stairs where we could watch
all of it together, you know when I was at that age, and at the top of this hallway there
was a cut out place with lights <unintelligible text> just made a brilliant scene. It was just
wonderful; it was just like they used to do in olden times.
Q. I would give anything to be able to see that and be a part of that.
A. You just don't know what it means to me. And I was telling somebody recently about I
think we had the most wonderful Christmases as a child, and I can so well remember on
Christmas Eve night, oh it was a great time, and mama would have us all get our baths
and get dressed for supper; and my parents were into all that with us. Then we went up to
the Methodist Church and that was before they had this church, but they had a beautiful
small red brick church. And we would gather all the town, the Methodists would gather
there; and the most beautiful Christmas trees they had. And all the women of the church
would dress dolls for their little girls. It was just like a big family; and you never did know
Dr. Thomason, but you've seen John Thomason's room <gap> Well, he had a marvelous
father, Dr. Thomason, he was a school superintendent; and he was always <gap> and
he would read <unintelligible text> and all our eyes, you know, would get big stars and he
would say: Here's another <gap> he's arriving. And about that time, we'd hear sleigh bells
and here would come Santa Claus in this red suit now with his bag over his shoulder and

give out all these toys. And then one of the most interesting things as I look back, after
that beautiful Christmas church service, we would come home over here to this house,
my family and my mother had gotten all these great big brown bags and enormous supply
of all kinds of fruits and candy and they let us help. We fixed Christmas bags for all the
servants in the family, not just ours but the man who came and did the carpentry work,
things like that. We'd fix oh a dozen or more
bags and then get them ready; and on Christmas morning they would all come by and say
Christmas gifts. And we had a big bag of Christmas food.
Q. That's marvelous, that's marvelous.
