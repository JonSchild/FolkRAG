THE SILVER SLIPPER. 
Song with Two Posture Dances, a 
Waltzing Chorus and Jig. 
Written by SAm'L N. 
M ITCHELL. 
Composed by HENRY TucEnn. 
The music of this sons is published Wu. A. PoNn 
Co, 547 Broadway, 
N. Y. Price 40 cents. 
THE moon was brightly shining, and a 
million little stars 
Sent down their rays upon her as I 
saw her through the bars ; 
A merry crowd had gathered there and dancing was the feature, 
But tire fairest flower in that bouquet was that charming little 
creature ; 
She was dancing ' neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper 
CliOntrS. 
Oh, I 
can't forget the sweet and lovely pet, (Posture Dance.) 
The neatest ever seen, a 
perfect little queen, (
Posture Donee.) 
For underneath the arbor I 
watched that lively clipper, 
And now my thoughts are centred on her little silver slipper. 
(Dance.) 
Her hair was all in ringlets, and a 
wreath of roses fair 
Breathed out the sweetest fragrance on the calm midsummer air ; 
A 
fascinating smile she had, her checks of ruby hue, 
And right above a 
Roman nose two eyes of violet blue ; 
She was dancing neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper. 
Oh, I 
can't forget, etc. 
I 
watched her all the evening, while my poor and wretched heart 
Was longing, vainly longing in that dance to take a 
part; 
The fates they were against me for a 
fence stood just between 
Me and that laughing jolly crowd that between the bars were 
seen; 
She was dancing ' neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper. 
Oh, I 
can't forGet, etc.

CRUEL GAL. 
(BANJO SOLO.) 
By ITAEEY WATSON, ei W ATSON .S.", ELLIS. 
Behold a 
poor deluded young man, 
With his cheeks besmeared with tears, tears, tears, 
Through the affections of one I 
loyal, 
And courted for many kng years. 
I 
treated her to ice cream and wine, 
But soon came the day of my woes, 
Oh, she fell in love with another sardine— 
He was a 
man with a 
wart on his nose ! 
Oh, the cause of my agitation was 
A fellow that walked the tight rope, rope, rope, 
He wrote a 
letter to my false one, 
Asking her to elope ! 
She sent him a 
lock of her blue red hair, 
And said she'd be his darling rose; 
With a 
big butcher knife I 
swore revenge, 
On the man with a 
wart on his nose. 
One night he made me feel very jealous. 
He announced on his rope would walk, walk, walk; 
So I 
resolved to put an end to his life, 
By playing a 
trick with his chalk. 
So I 
greased his rope with a 
tallow candle, 
And smiled as he walked on his toes; 
He slipped and fell on a 
big brick bat, 
And busted the wart on his nose. 
Oh, they bathed his head in kerosene oil, 
But no sign of life did he make 
So I 
resolved to speak to my rose once more, 
But bravely she gave me the shake, shake, shake, 
So in sad despair I 
wander, 
My heart for some one to dispose, 
My Rosey keeps as a 
relic in a 
little alcohol, 
That wart I 
knocked off his nose.

Cold and wood I'll give a-way ;

success at TONY PASTOR'S. 
FAR away in the South, among the cotton fi.4(.1g. 
Is the place I 
ever long to see ; 
Oh ! the dear sunny clime where I 
was bred and born, 
hid the memory is ever dear to me ; 
! 
the mocking bird's singing in the trees close by, 
While far from the spot I 
now roam, 
In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home, 
cnor,t-s. 
Then give me a 
home in the dear old South, 
For fondly I 
love it still ; 
Then I 
sigh night and day, what I 
long to see again 
Is that old log cabin on the hill. 
Oh ! the ones I 
love is sleeping in the ground, 
When I 
am passing so fast away. 
And my heart grows so sad I 
bug to return, 
Oh ! the old man ain't what be used to be ; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
Oh ! I 
will go back again, back to them cotton holds. 
In that old cabin home there le', me die. 
Then give me, etc. 
GOOD-BYE,

LOVE IN THE LANE. 
The music of this song is pliblished by E. II . 
H ARDING„T29 Bowery, New 
York. 
WHILE lilacs bloom in yonder lane, 
Sweet resort of bird and bee, 
Ere the sun forsakes the plain, 
One I 
love will watch for me. 
'Where the linnet fluttereth low, 
Where the gate swings to and fro, 
Where the wild white roses grow, 
Agnes will be waiting me. 
My bonny Agnes will be waiting, 
Waiting at the gate for me. 
My bonny Agnes will be waiting, waiting, 
Waiting at the gate for me. 
To paint her beauty, words would fail ; 
Nature's own sweet child she seems, 
Leaning o'er yon time- worn rail, 
Lost in Love's delicious dreams. 
When to her this ring I 
show, 
Fast the crimson tide will flow, 
O'er her face and breast of snow. 
Stay, fair sun thy parting beams. 
My bonny Agnes, etc. 
She heard my step, one joyful start, 
One low cry of ecstasy, 
As I 
pressed her to my heart, 
'Neath the bright plumed lilac tree ; 
Then we wandered side by side, 
As the purple twilight died ; 
And I 
whispered to my bride, 
0 how blest our home will be. 
My bonny Agnes, etc.

Sam Devere's Villian Still Pursued 
Her. 
Written an sung with immense success by Si DEVEI1E. 
Of the troubles of a 
nice young gal I'll tell, 
Oh, she was a 
South Fifth Avenue belie ; 
There was a 
tall, short, thick set built man, 
Who was mashed on Liz McGruder; 
Wherever she went, she was never content, 
For the villain still pursued her. 
She washed her face and wiped her nose, 
Then dressed herself in her Sunday clothes; 
As stiff as starch was the dress she wore, 
She was an ironer, a 
w 
tslier and a 
fluter, 
On her head was a 
wreath, and she wore false teeth, 
But the villain still pursued her. 
0, the ducks and the geese were a-singing in the trees, 
The air was soft with a 
clammy breeze; 
At the hour of twelve on a 
moonlight night, 
She went to meet her suitor, 
She slipped on a 
pie, run the crust in her eye, 
But the villain still pursued her. 
One day she went in a 
Dutchman's store, 
Her dress was bruised and her eye was tore ; 
Oh, she tried to conceal in her pocketbook a 
ham 
And the Dutchman then did shoot her ; 
She fell on her knees with a 
mouthful of cheese, 
And the villain still pursued her.

Oh, Ella flee, so kind and true, 
In the little churchyard lies,

Then carry me back to Tennessce, 
There let me live and die, 
Among the fields of yellow corn, 
And the land where Ella lie. 
The summer moon will rise and set, 
And the night-birds trill their lay, 
And the pc) sum and coon so softly step, 
Round the grave of E,la flee. 
Then carry me back to Tennessee, 
There let me live aid die,

THE MINSTREL BOY. 
The minstrel boy to the war is gone, 
In the ranks of death you'll find him ; 
His father's sword he's girded on, 
And the wild burp strung behind him. 
Land of song— said the warrior bard, 
Though all the world betray thee, 
One s ord at least its right shall guard. 
One faithful harp shall praise thee. 
The minstrel feL, but the foentan's chainti 
Could not keep his proud soul under ; 
The lia -p 
he loved no'er spoke again, 
lie lore the strings asunder ; 
And said : " no chains shall sully thee, 
Thou soul of love and bravery, 
Thy songs were made for the pure and free 
They Eball never sound in slavery 1"

OH, good-evening, white folks, how do you do ?

We're pretty well, and how are you ?

DOWN AMONG THE DAISIES. 
Written by W. A. IIWNTLEY, banjoist, for W ILL. H . 
M ORTON. 
Down among the daisies, by the running stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low; 
Sitting with my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and go. 
There I meet my darling every summer's day, 
And the leaflets nodding up above 
Were the only ones that list to what we'd say, 
As we whispered o'er our tales of love. 
CrIORtiS. 
Down among the daisies, by the running stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low 
Sitting by my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and go. 
Down among the daisies we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream; 
Naught will ever come to break the happy spell, 
Break the happy glimmer of our dream. 
Days may come and go, like flowers that bloom and die, 
But as long as life is with us, queen, 
We will dwell together, you and I, 
Down among the daisies by the stream. 
Down among the, etc.

FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE. 
BA SOLO. 
(2t-ezu Air.) 
Written and composed by SAM LEVEES. 
DECEPTION just now is the rule :Ill around, 
It's practiced in all shades of life ; 
Just mind what I 
say, and be careful, my friends, 
When the time comes to pick out a 
wife. 
Her eyes may be loving, her smile may be sweet, 
When you approach her she's timid and afraid ; 
Be careful, look well before making the leap, 
You don't know how the dear girl is made. 
In the good days of old, in our grand-mothers' time, 
Girls didn't enamel or paint ; 
Didn't wear palpitators their bosoms to swell, 
Didn't lace themselves up till they'd faint ; 
Didn't wear patent calves, or use bloom of youth, 
And the rose in their cheecks didn't fade. 
You must know a 
girl well now before you get stuck, 
For she's fearfully and wonderfully made. 
Girls long ago didn't pencil their brows, 
Use lotions to make the skin fair; 
The girls long ago combed the hair on their heads, 
Now it's combed on the back of a 
chair. 
I've got more to tell when I 
see you alone, 
I 
have said too much here I'm afraid. 
But before you get married, examine them well, 
For they're fearfully and wonderfully made.

MY OLD HOME IN CAROLINA 'FORE DE 
W AR. 
OLD MAN NEGRO CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and Music by ROY LESLIE. 
OH, here I 
am, kind friends, a 
poor old colored man, 
Heart broken by trouble and despair, 
Who no one seems to care for me but the heavenly Father 
above, 
Who I-know still keeps a 
home for me there. 
I've wandered for years homeless on this earth, 
I'm old and I 
cannot work no more, 
And it was a 
sorry day the time I 
came away, 
From my old home in Carolina 'fore de war. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, give me back the old home of my birth, 
And I 
never will leave it any more, 
For I'll have a 
place to live, and they'll bury me when 
I'm dead, 
In my old home in Carolina 'fore de war. 
Oh, well do I 
remember when I-was a 
little child, 
A 
playing around the boiler in the mill, 
And de sound of all de wheels as dey crushed de sugar 
cane, 
Are humming in my ears plainly still. 
And well do I 
remember when our day's work was done, 
How we'd dance at night upon de old log cabin floor. 
Bey can talk about the freeman, but I'd rather be a 
slave 
In my old home in Carolina ' fore de war. 
Oh, give me back, etc. " 
And now, kind friends, I 
must be going, I 
cannot sing no 
more, 
These happy recollections give me pain. 
Although I'm old and feeble I'll try to reach my home, 
For soon my soul my Father He will claim. 
It was a 
sad mistake, but now it is too late, 
When de North and de South were made one, 
For we den had enough to eat and we had a 
place to 
sleep, 
Many, many years ago when I 
was young. 
Oh, give me back, etc.

DORKINS WAS TIGHT." 
Written by BENJ. D. 
COLLINS. 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAxs. 
THE theatre was full, and so were the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear _ 
That night in a 
bare-footed slack-wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here_ 
The bar-room was fearfully crowded with beats 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise ; 
For they knew they would eat 
When the lunch was set out, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah ; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
But they gave him the laugh and yah I 
yah ! 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure ; 
" 
He's away off his base," says John Jas. Mansfield, 
That never went back on the poor. 
A 
brick—,,vell it was—I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark red for two; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
• But continually dropping his cue. 
He says, " ibn the Zing," when a 
woman jumped up 
Cried, " yon lie, for you're one of the gang, 
And you owe me for washing." That knocked Dorkins 
cold, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If Ihaven't drank enough bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not in 
head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer ; 
When me and Jun Stokes walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here. 
You insult me to-night and say 1 
am sober, 
For years I've been a 
Hamlet alone ; 
tell yon the reason, I 
know you will treat, 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead—drunk at home."

I'VE a 
daughter Julia, 
She is seventeen, 
And I'm told by all the neighbor; 
She looks like a 
queen. 
You should see her dancing, 
At it she's engaged, 
In the ballet she's the star, 
For she's on the stage. 
She can dance upon her toes. (Break.) 
To the music around she goes. (Break.) 
CHORUS. 
Dancing on the stage, 
Oh, but she does please, 
Around she glides with graceful form, 
And with, oh, such ease. 
She's a 
little beauty, 
And I 
will engage, 
There is not another girl, 
Like Julia on the stage. 
'When the music's playing, 
How the people shout ; 
On the stage they throw bouquets, 
-When Julia does come out. 
Like a 
shadow gliding, 
Dressed sometimes as page, 
In the play to king or queen, 
-
Ally Julia's on the stage. 
She's her father's joy and pride. (Break) 
Like a 
fairy ylph se glides. (

THE CINCINNATI HAM. 
Words and music by E. M . 
HALL. 
Sung by HARRY -W OODSON, at CAR:cciloss & DIXEY'S Minstals, 
Philadelphia. 
JOSEPHUS JOHNSON gave a 
ball, 
And invited the darkeys all, 
For miles they came ill by the score, 
To flop their fat feet on the floor. 
(
Sym.) 
They had a 
fiddler from the country, 
He could only play one tune, 
The yellow clarinet was played; 
Quite gently blown by the breath of a 
big black coon. 
Sycamore Lize and E. Flat Sam, 
Can't you hand me down the Cincinnati Ham. 
There was old Mrs. Simpson's sister Sue, 
Black Moorish and Duck-Foot Sue, 
And Stephen Granger when he'd swing, 
He'd clear the floor with the pigeon wing. 
You all blow about high kickers, 
Go and see Granger, then you'll talk, 
He cleared the head of old Joe Previous, 
Then kicked the scalp from a 
six-foot gawk. 
Don't wear your feet out on the floor ; 
For when they're gone you'll get no more. 
Sycamore Lize and E. Flat Sam, 
Can't you hand me down that Cincinnati Ham ?

Ty you. want an hour's diversion in seeing funny tricks, 
Walk over with me silently to Casey's row of bricks ; 
There'll you see Paul Casey, a 
cradle he does rock, 
Surrounded by young " gammons " and the girleens on 
our block. 
There's the Caseys and Laceys, from the divil knows 
where, 
Throwing packs of firecrackers ' neath grandfather's rock-
ing chai r, 
Ami sitting in the yard at night all drinking rye and rock, 
Singing rims 
ft ring a 
rosey with the girleens on our 
block. 
Ring a

rosey, a 
bottle full of rye, 
My darling is a 
posey and lives on lemon pie ; 
Casey cries all hands around, the cradle we will rock,

Of a 
warm night in summer, on the roof we try to sleep, 
The blackguards from the corners on their hands and 
feet do creep, 
They have a 
big stuffed bladder, they crib us an awful 
sock, 
Which creates a 
roar of hughter from the girleens on our 
block.

Good morning, Randeen Murphy, your head is swelled 
to-day, 
Go tell your wife it's now her turn to scrub the alleyway, 
Burly soft soap in the Dutchman's, get a 
lump of salt rock, 
My mother will assist her with the girls on the block. 
Faith they rubbed and scrubbed till the sun went down

It was ten o'clock at night before they took a

OF 
a 
hungry man I'm going to sing, 
And tears to your eyes it will surely bring, 
He could swallow almost anything, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
He'd eat a 
hundred times a 
day 
And for his board he could not pay, 
He could get outside of a 
bale of ha•-• 
This hungry man from Harlem 
CHORUS. 
The way he'd eat it couldn't be beat 
All kinds of meat both sour and sweet, 
He'd eat everything they had in the place, 
And bite a 
big chunk from his mother-in-law's face 
He chewed up his father, devoured his mother, 
He swallowed his sister and tackled his brother, 
He swallowed the clock, bit a 
hole in the door, 
Chewed a 
hole in the roof and swallowed the floor, 
He chewed up his shoes and chewed up his hat, 
Made a 
raid on the kitchen and swallowed the cat. 
He chewed umbrellas and eat seven stoves, 
And bit off one-half of the servant girl's nose. 
And that's the way he used to eat, 
This hungry man from Harlem.

THE HUNGRY MAN FROM HARLEM—Co--
eluded. 
He eat so much it made him thin, 
His hair fell out and his cheeks fell in, 
His bones were sticking thro' his skin, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
He struck this city one fine clay 
And for a 
meal he could not pay, 
He took a 
walk along Broadway, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
The way he'd eat, etc. 
The very first thing he chanced to meet 
'Twas a 
German Band coming down the street, 
He swallowed them all, as fast as they come, 
He chewed up the music and eat the base-
drum. 
He tackled a 
crowd coming home from a 
ball, 
They began for to dance and he swallowed them all. 
He went down to the ferry and swallowed a 
boat, 
He went out on, election and chewed up his vote. 
At last he came into Brooklyn town, 
He met a 
big preacher, and gobbled him down ; 
He swallowed a 
pump, put his teeth thro' the handle, 
And eat the reports of the Brooklyn scandal. 
Then, getting disgusted with grub so light, 
He swallowed himself clean out of sight, 
And that's the way he used to eat, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
The way he'd eat, etc.

ONE MORE SCHOONER LIKE I HAD LAST 
NIGHT. 
Am. —" Where was Moses when the Light went Out." 
DALBENDER keeps on Grand street, 
That's the place to buy good beer, 
For when you drink a 
keg or two, 
It makes you feel so queer. 
The other night a 
man got full, 
Of him his wife had fear, 
When morning came he sung out in 
A 
voice so loud and clear: 
cHor,us. 
One more schooner like I 
had last night, 
One more keg, I'll put it out of sight ; 
All you men so free come and drink with me, 
One more schooner like I 
had last night. 
Dalbender runs a 
concert, 
Monday, Wednesday, Saturday night ; 
The boys they patronize him, 
For he always treats them right. 
And when the fun is over, 
They all leave so light and gay; 
When morning comes if you're around, 
I'm sure you'd hear them say : 
One more schooner, etc. 
Daibender has a 
Thomas cat, 
lie lays about the place ; 
Although he kecps it to himself. 
He knows most every face. 
This cat he is a 
sick cat, 
With no other cat he'll play. 
He winked at in 
tins morning, 
And I 
thought I 
heard him say : 
One more schooner, etc. 
BEAUTIFUL LOVE. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Lo', love, oh, what is love 1 
love, 'tie that makes man feel so 
peculiar: 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud, a Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia 1 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round and 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the 
rst ai,tack it's like raspberry jam, running 
down ones back. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, lore it is that makes a 
man feel so pecu 
liar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man'e but a 
fool when he falls in love. 
Oh, love, when you're in love, ta pinsents, to parties and picnics 
you treat her, 
Oh, love, just squeeze her glove, and yor feel just as tho' you'd 
like to eat her ; 
But the best of loves must part—then an gnd comes to your 
bliss, 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the 
parting kiss, 
You bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
Oh, love, etc. 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning yourself 
in cold water; 
If it's all right she'll giggle and say, please ask father if I 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, etc. 
'Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked- for happiness begins with a mother-in-law sad 
beautiful twins. 
Oh love, ete. 
GRANDMOTITTIR'S CHAIR. 
As sung by JACK CONROY with immense success. 
The Music of this song will be sent to any address, post paid, on receipt 
of price, 10 cents. 
M Y 
grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood side by side. 
To my brother it was found, she had left a hundred 
pounds, 
The same unto my sister, I 
declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said, " I 
see, 
She has left to you her old arm- chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they tittered, how they chaffed, 
How my brother and sister laughed, 
When they heard the lawyer declare, 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the evening took the chair away; 
The neighbors they me chaffed, my brother at me 
laughed, 
And said it will be useful John some day. 
GRANDMOTHER'S CHAIR.—Concluded. 
When you settle down in life, find some girl to be your 
wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare ; 
On a 
cold frosty night, when the fire is burning bright, 
You can sit in your old arm- chair. 
And how they.tittered, etc. 
What my brother said was true, for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say, I 
settled down in married life; 
I 
first a 
girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church, and when she was my wife 
The old girl and me were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over, I 
declare, 
ne'er abroad would roam, but each night would stay at 
home, 
And be seated in my old arm- chair. 
And how they tittered, etc. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
picked it up I 
found 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor; 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more. 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage, and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laughed at him, then said unto him, Jam, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm- chair ? 
And how they tittered, etc.

SUCH AN AWFUL SLUGGER IS MY BROTHER 
DAN. 
Written by HARRY CAMPBELL, and sung with great success by 
JOHNNY ROACH. 
I'VE a 
great big brother Daniel, for short they call him 
Dan, 
He's a 
porter in a 
great big dry-goods store; 
He used to be a 
boxer before the hard work began. 
If he'd hit you you'd think your dream of love was o'er. 
He can drink more rot-gut whiskey than twenty common 
men, 
He's as purty as a 
black-and-tan, 
Just bring him a 
lot of blind men, he'd paralyze eight or 
ten, 
Such an awful slugger is my brother Dan. 
CHORUS. 
He's a 
fighter, such a 
biter, 
Try to whip him you never can ; 
He's as full of pluck as a 
Bowery knuck, 
Such an awful slugger is my brother Dan. 
He goes with a 
lot of rowdies, they call themselves " de 
gang," 
You'd get fooled if you thought he had no sense, 
He's in with all the boxers that around Harry Hill's do 
hang, 
He knows all the manly art of self-defence. 
He goes down to Owney Geoghegan's, it's there he'll dance 
and sing, 
About Muldoon the chap that always filled your can, 
And you should see him get on the out side of a 
big gin-
sling, 
Such an awful slugger is my brother Dan. 
He's a 
fighter, etc. 
He was boss heeler of Fulton Market before he took to 
work 
Before him all the scrappers bent the knee ; 
f..le was handy with a 
pistol, you should see him flash a 
dirk, 
Or break a 
man's head with a 
shillaleh. 
In a 
rough-and-tumble or a 
square stand-up, he'd carried 
off the prize, 
And he never from an an-ta-go-nist ran, 
He wouldn't care if he weighed a 
ton, he'd fight until he 
died, 
Such an awful slugger is my brother Dan. 
He's a 
fighter, etc.

OUR ARMY AND NAVY OF BLUE, 
Written, Composed and sung by BOBBY NEWCOMBE. 
Copyrighted, 1878, by E. H. HARDING. 
LIST to the music while I 
sing a 
lay, 
In praise of our flag, boys, that waved for many a 
day ;-
It sheltered our soldiers and sailors so true, • 
It covers our Army and Navy of Blue. 
CHORUS. 
Over our heads, boys, flaunting to the breeze ;-
Up to the peak greeting all lands and seas I 
The emblem of Liberty, ever so true, 
That covers our Army and Navy of Blue. 
Peace be our motto, charity our cause, 
Faith to our colors, respect to our laws ! 
Friendship our greeting, our flag as it flew 
Inspired our brave Army and Navy of Blue. 
CHORUS. 
Over our heads, boys, flaunting to the breeze; 
Up to the peak, greeting all lands and seas ! 
The emblem of Liberty ever so true,

BANJO SOLO—" COMING THRO THE RYE." 
sung by HARRY STAR WOOD. 
Old Mother Hublnrd she went to the cupboard 
To save her poor dog's health, 
Mary said to her little lamb, 
You know how it is yourself. 
The boy that would a- wooing go 
3.. Was in the cold ground laid. 
Oh, Johnny, 1 
hardly knew you since 
You joined the free lunch Brigade. 
Champagne Charley is my name, 
While rolling home in the morn, 
Maggie sitting by my side 
I 
tell you den I 
was gone. 
Oh put me in my little bed 
I 
just want forty winks, 
rin lonely since may mother died 
And so is Captain Jinks. 
The forty thieves have stolen my heart, 
Musquitos stung my ear, 
The soldier leaned upon his swotd 
Then wiped away a 
tear, 
On the Beach at Long Branch 
I 
walked with bonny Jean 
They were hanging frogs in Canada 
For the wearing of the green. 
Hark I 
hear an angel sing 
A-coming through the rye, 
Mother may I 
go to swim 
To root hog or die. 
The spider coaxed the little fly, 
His royal nib ,: 
felt queer, 
Trying to see the new Post Office. 
Then walked o1 oa his ear.

DE BLACKWELL. 
Sang by HARRIGAN & HART in EDWARD HARRIGAN'S great burlesque, 
the " Celebrated Bard Case." 
Come gather ye cracksmen 
And ganiffs so fly, 
Maces and braces, 
Shoplifters draw nigh. 
I'll warble a 
ditty, 
While the chorus you swell, 
Of the blokes doing time 
On the Isle de Blackwell. 
CHORUS. 
With my one, two, and three four, 
Then all in a 
line, 
To the shoe shop and quarry 
Each bloke must keep time. 
We work like a 
Turk, 
Then back to our cell, 
Such a 
grand institution 
Is the Isle de Blackwell. 
Oh, there is a 
d:rling 
Who'd sugar galore, 
He hypothecated to 
The Canada shore. 
The boodle was heavy, 
He tripped and fell, 
Singing Moody and Sankey 
On the Isle de Blackwell! 
With my one, two, etc. 
Oh, there is a 
baby, 
'Tis a 
pity he's here, 
He was nabbed by a 
hipper 
A- shoving the queer. 
His people are nobby, 
On the Avenue they swell, 
He's a 
family skeleton 
On the Isle de Blackwell. 
With my one, two, etc. 
There's Scotty, our keeper, 
We all know his snoot, 
He collars the old togs 
Than hands out a 
suit 
Striped like a 
zebra ; 
Then it's good-bye. farewell, 
We're regular boarders 
On the Isle de Black well. 
With my one, two, etc.

way, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
SAINT PATRICK was a 
gentleman, 
Sure his name we celebrate, 
And on the seventeenth of March 
The Irish concentrate ; 
A 
bran-new hat on each man's head, 
And a 
green necktie that's newly made; 
The left foot first, then lightly tread 
In the Patrick's day parade ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow, 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
CHORUS. 
We shout hurrah for Erin go bragh, 
And all the Yankee nation, 
Stars and stripes, and shamrock bright arraytd; 
The Irish shout, the girls turn out, 
To see the celebration; 
We march stiff' as starch, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
You should see the marshal on his horse, 
Like Napoleon Bonyparte, 
And as he rides along the line, 
He'd break each lady's heart, 
And if the rain should fall down then, 
We hoist our umbrellas Mob, 
For history states that Irishmen 
Are always warm and dry; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc. 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
And though I'm not a 
drinking man, 
On that day I'd drink my beer; 
I'll wear the shamrock in my hat; 
The green, my boys, ' twill never fade, 
And march along with Dan an' Pat, 
In the Patrick's day parade; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, ete-
GET THEE GONE, 
MAN. 
W ritten by NED Goss. 
AIR.- 44 Isle De Blackwell." 
On, a 
curious story I 
wish to relate, 
That happened way over in Michigan State; 
It's of a 
young damsel I'll now tell to you, 
That lived with her parients in Kalamazoo. 
Of course they were wealthy, of money had much, 
Her father was Irish and her mother was Dutch. 
Whenever I'd call on her the old man would frown, 
SPOKEN.—And say: 
Get thee gone, man, get the gone, man, 
• 
*And you bet the man would get thee gone. 
Oh, this damsel was handsome, the fairest e'er seen, 
Her nose it was red, and her eyes they were green ; 
Her teeth they were freckled, she'd a 
wart on her ear ; 
And then such a 
great mouth for Millwatikee beer. 
She'd a 
hump on her back like a 
big cam-mi-mile, 
She was cross-eyed in both feet, to see her you'd smile,. 
Whene'er I'd call on her the old man would shout out, 
Get, thee out, man, get thee out, man, 
And you bet the man would get thee out.

APPLE OF NY EYE. 
Words and Music by Wm. H. anima/mi. 
Oh where, oh where, 
Can all the music be, 
Falling on my ear, 
Floating in the air 2 
Or, are the angels 
Singing love to me, 
'Bout Miss Susie Dean, 
The apple of my eye. 
Oh Susie, my darling, 
I 
hope I 
never die; 
That you may live forever, 
The apple of my eye; 
'Twas in the orchard, Susie darling, 
When no one else was nigh, 
I 
called you then my star and treasure, 
The apple of my eye. 
It fills my soul 
With joy and ecstacy; 
The memory is so sweet, 
Of when we first did meet. 
The sweetest fruit, 
That ripens on a 
tree, 
With Susie can't compete, 
The apple of my eye. 
Oh, Susie, my darling, 
I 
hope I 
never die, 
That you may live forever, 
The apple of my eye; 
'Twas in the orchard, Susie darlin,g, 
When no one else was nigh, 
I 
called you then my star and treasure, 
The apple of my eye.

THE DAY I PLAYED BASE BALL. 
Sung by PAT ROONET. 
M Y 
name it is O'Halloher, 
I'm a 
man that's influential, 
I 
mind my business, stop at home, 
My wants are few an' small, 
Some blackguards %other day did. come, 
They were full of whiskey, gin and rum, 
An' they took me out in the broilin' sun, 
To play a 
game of ball. 
They made me carry all the bats, 
They nearly drove me crazy, 
An' they sent me out into " centre field," 
But I 
paralyzed them all. 
I 
put up me hands to catch a " fly," 
Holy murther, it struck me in the eye, 
And they hung me on a 
line to dry, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
I 
took the bat an' hit the ball 
I 
thought to San Francisco, 
An' thin around the bases 
Three times I 
ran them all, 
But thin the gang began to howl, 
An' they said, ould .man you made a 
fowl, 
An' they rubbed me down with a 
Turkish towel, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
Two reporters begged to know me name, 
An' presinted me wid a 
medal, 
An' they asked me for me photograph 
To hang upon the wall. 
They said that I 
had won the game, 
'no' my head was broke and my shoulder lame. 
An' they sent me home in a 
cattle train, 
The day I 
played base ball.

"PRETTY WAITER GIRL." 
AIR.—" 
lIiidebrant Montrose." 
W E 
met within the gay saloon, 
Her eyes they sparkled sweetly; 
The fiddles played their liveliest tune, 
My heart was won completely; 
She charmed me with her pretty ways 
And form of matchless grace; 
She looked just like a 
fairy—. 
A sunbeam in the place I 
SPOKE:T.—And this is what she said— 
CHORUS. 
Tra la, tra le, my Charlie, dear, 
What is it going to be, love, champagne or beer ? 
She was the sweetest charmer, my heart was in a 
whirl,— 
' 
never can forget her, that pretty waiter girl. 
Though others thronged that gay saloon 
She smiled upon me only; 
Her pensive air it seemed to say— 
I 
am so sad and lonely; 
Her eyes so softly glanced at me, 
Then drooped with modest look., 
I 
felt just like a 
little fish 
Just caught upon a 
hook. 
SPOKEN. — When our eyes met she would sigh and say— 
Tra la, tra le, etc. 
Her smiles were like the bright champagne, 
Her cheeks were like bright sherry; 
I 
came to see her every night,— 
The time it passed so merry. 
Her image in my constant heart 
I 
carried day by day, 
And in my dreams at midnight 
I 
often heard her say— 
SPOKEN.—This— 
Tra h, tra le, etc. 
At last I 
told her all my love, 
And asked her woulA she marry ? 
She blushed just like a 
peony, 
And begged me for to tarry; 
She turned away with modest air, 
And heaved a 
gentle sigh; 
Oh, how her eyes did sparkle 
When thus she made reply— 
Tra Ia, tra le etc.

HARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
OF 
all the troublesome creatures 
That cling to a 
married man's life, 
There is none with such terrible features 
As the " Ma" of your own little wife. 
Her head is filled with suggestions 
For the good of connubial bliss, 
She'll kill you outright with her question; 
Take my advice just in this, 
CHORUS. 
Don't marry your mother-in-law, 
Keep out of the reach of her paw, 
# 
You had better be dead 
With a 
slab at your head, 
Than to marry your mother-in-law! 
Should your home e'er seem lonely and dreary, 
Your wife will then send for her sure, 
" 
It's so nice for Ma to come, Charley," 
Says your darling; you must it endure. 
And if your dear wife prove deficient 
In matters known to womankind, 
Her mother will post her in all thinas, 
And drive you well out of your mind. 
Don't marry, etc. 
She'll keep you all day in hot water, 
And worry you almost to death, 
Till you wish in your heart that her daughter 
And herself had never dra wn breath ! 
She'll make your much hoped for Elysium 
A 
desert of unendinri strife, 
So keep these few words in your vision, 
When you take to yourself a 
young wife. 
Pont marry, etc.

THE CURLY HEADED HASHER. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written by R OY LESLIE for BILLY CARTER. 
I
'LL sing a 
song of a 
nice young man, 
Who thought himself a 
masher, 
He told the girls he was clerk in a 
bank, 
But the truth he was a 
hasher. 
He would work from sunrise in the morn 
Until his lunch was over, 
Then he'd dress himself up in a 
ten dollar 
it, 
And he'd go out on the mash, sir. 
CHORUS. 
He was born in the Fall, 
This man with a 
gall, 
So loud he would bawl 
For hash through the hall. 
He laid over them all 
And he'd run them to the wall 
And he never would fall, 
This curly headed hasher. 
One day when the matinee was out, 
He met a 
charming lady ; 
He called her his love and turtle dove, 
And then she called him baby. 
Some time after this to his hotel 
Went this charming lady, 
And she saw her mash a 
slicing his hash, 
On her head he spilt some gravy. 
CHORUS. 
'When he saw his mash, 
He dropped with a 
crash 
A 
plate full of hash. 
From her room he did dash, 
As quick as a 
flash ; 
He shook his mash 
As quick as a 
flash, 
This curly headed hasher.
