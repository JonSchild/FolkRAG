KS: I’m Kim Stryker and I’m here with Bill Hatch, and you are from Zephaniah? Am I saying 
it right? 
BH: Zephaniah Farm Vineyard. 
KS: Zephaniah. 
BH: You pronounced it very nicely. 
KS: OK good! I’ve been practicing… in Leesburg. And today is the second of - second month, 
February 24 of 2018. 
BH: It is. 
KS: ...and we are at the Virginia Vineyards Association meeting in Charlottesville. Time is now 
about two, almost 2:40, 2:39, and we're talking to Bill about his work in Virginia wine. So I 
know a little bit -I’ve cheated!--because I've talked to your son. 
BH: Mhhm. 
KS: So I know that you had a family farm that you were farming. I believe you were doing dairy 
and cattle? 
BH: Yes, dairy and cattle.

KS: And then you... looking down the road, you wanted to, um, find something that would be a 
little more financially sustainable for the future of the farm. 
BH: Good term. 
KS: Yeah. Okay, so how did wine come up as the solution? 
BH: We got out of dairy farming in 1986, and now I tell everybody that it was a bad business to 
be in. It’s a commodity. Uh... my milk would went with everybody else's milk and sold it at the 
store for whatever the US government kind of set the support price, more or less. 
KS: Right. 
[00:01:27] 
BH: So we got out in ‘86 and we wandered in the woods for a few years trying to figure out 
what to do, and we took up beef cattle, but I realized that that would NOT sustain the family 
farm. So… (clears throat) I was interested in grapes and wine, but I found that wine was 
extremely intimidating and my family thought I was insane to even think about growing wine. 
And they told me that. So... in 2001, my daughter, Emily, Tremain's older sister, was in school, 
and she went to a semester abroad up in Alto Adige, in Südtirol in Italy, up in the Alps. 
KS: Nice! 
BH:So we went up to visit her and she was living in a barn, studying in a castle, it was a great 
experience for her… 
KS: Wow! 
BH: ... and for me to visit her. So, on a visit in March... in 200 .. 1. I had a conversation on Sunday 
evening with Zitzo, who was the professor of Agricultural Archeology. Yeah, and um, that was a 
study of how farming was carried out 1,100 years ago in the middle ages. 
KS: Right. 
[00:02:42]

BH: And so in this conversation, we talked about grapes and wine extensively from Alta Adige. 
And I said, Zitzo, I would love to grow wine in Virginia, but maybe it's beyond the dairy farmer 
from Virginia to grow this magnificent beverage. Zitzo looked at me and said, “Bill, its farming. 
Just plant the damn grapes!” 
 
KS: (laughing) 
 
BH:The light bulb went off! and we planted a 1000 vines the next year. And, uh, that was now 
16 years ago! 
 
KS: Wow. So the first vines went in, what year? 
BH: Uh, 2002. 
KS: So, you really moved on it! He told you and you… 
BH: Oh yeah. 
KS: … just went up and DID it. 
 
BH: Oh yeah, the next year planted 1,000. On Spring break, I had my twin daughters, and my 
son, and my wife and myself out digging holes - planting holes. 
KS: Wow. And… so your first vintage was three…? 
[00:03:36] 
BH: 2003. No, we had a crop in year two, it was a dairy farm. It was a field close to the barn and 
the adage in the dairy business is that the manure field goes closest to the barn. Because you 
have to haul manure every day. 
 
KS: Right. 
 
BH: So, HIGH organic matter, grew very well the first year. We had a crop in year two, and uh… 
KS: Wow. 
BH: That was quite a few vintages ago. So we made an experimental wine for family use till 
2007, and my wife said, you're spending all your time and all your money doing that. You need

to get a license. So we did. We got a license in 2007, and that was the first vintage we produced 
legally commercially. And it turned out pretty well. 
 
KS: And so now you have the whole tasting room and everything. Um… are you…? When did the 
tasting room go up? 
 
[00:04:35] 
 
BH: Um, well. I grew up in a 200 year old home, brick home in Leesburg. And we opened the 
tasting room in 2009 in that 200 year old home. And… so the home was already there. It really 
didn't take much alteration at all. It also involved... I mean, to kind of changes that took place… 
was that in 2009, we opened a tasting room with a BAR, which is what everybody else seemed 
like they were doing, a tasting room and a bar. And I visited Oregon in 2000 and 9, and went to 
a vineyard called Stoller Vineyard. Run by Bill Stoller, who had grown up on a turkey farm, 
similar to dairy farming. 
 
KS: Uh huh. 
 
BH: And uh, we went into their winery and Bill Stoller, or uh, has his employees say: “Have a 
seat, we’re going to bring the wine to you.” So my wife and I looked at each other and said, we 
need to do THIS. We have seated tastings now, that’s kind of our signature event: seated 
tastings in the 200 year old home. 
 
KS: Nice! 
 
BH: ...and we're still carrying that out today. And then three years ago, we completed our new 
cellar. Because we were making all of our wine in a basement, and we completed a new cellar 
and then had to put a timber frame tasting room above that. Now, it turns out that everybody 
still wants to be in the 200 year old home. So the brand new timber frame is used for groups 
and overflow. When we run out of room in the 200-year old home. 
 
[00:06:27] 
 
KS: Okay. [pause] And so, so what surprised you about the transition from dairy and cattle to 
being a wine grower? 
 
BH: More fun.

KS: More fun? 
BH: Yeah, more fun. And I’m having more fun than I’ve EVER had, um… 
KS: Really? 
BH: Um, dairy farming is a great family business and you get to talk to your neighbors maybe 
once a week or maybe once a month, because there's not much interchange socially. And in the 
wine business, you're talking to customers every day that they come in to taste your wine. And 
nobody ever asked me about milk and how what vintage it was [Kim laughs], and how did you 
make it? Nobody ever said: “I love your milk!” but in the wine business, people say: “I love your 
wine.” That's a great reward. 
 
KS: Yeah, and well we’ve heard some really sad stories lately about dairy farmers, having a 
really hard time… 
 
BH: Yeah. 
 
KS: ... and just not being able to make a go of it anymore. And (laughing) maybe they SHOULD 
have vintages of milk and, you know, they SHOULD have a small batch dairy production or 
something like that. 
 
BH: Oh. We agree. And had... we stayed in the dairy business, it would be to directly to 
consumer. And my brother and I had a conversation on the farm 35 years ago, and we decided 
that whatever we did on the farm was gonna have to be direct to consumer. That's what we 
both do now. My brother grows grass-fed cattle, and he sells all the grass-fed cattle at farmer's 
markets. And sheep/lamb. 
 
KS: Oh OK. And does he work on the same land as you? Do you both…? 
[00:08:10] 
BH: Um, it IS the same land. Family farm. Originally it was 400 acres and uh, my wife and I 
bought 27 acres and the 200 year old home from my family. 
 
KS: Okay. 
 
BH: I mentioned they thought I was crazy. They did not wanna join me in the effort. So we are 
growing grapes and my brother is using all the rest of the farm for beef.

[00:08:40] 
 
KS: Right… so. Um, You haven't been able to convince him that wine is the way to go? 
 
BH: Uh, interesting, uh relationship… my brother, I get along pretty well, but um, he will very 
frequently say: “Wine business is lot different than the beef business. Wineries have a lot more 
income.” (laughs) And yes, yes they do. A lot more expenses and a lot more income. 
 
KS: Yeah. And… maybe interacting with the public is not for everybody. 
BH: Yeah. 
KS: So… What have you been surprised about seeing? Obviously, there's been huge changes in 
Virginia wine. 
 
BH: Oh boy. Yeah, I had somebody just tell me the other day that there were 200 wineries in 
North Carolina. When I went to my FIRST seminar about wine making or starting a winery, it 
was 
in North Carolina, when there were NINE wineries. And that was in… was in 2000. 
KS: Wow! 
[00:09:34] 
 
BH: In Virginia, there were 56 wineries in 2000. And now there are 200 and 80 some wineries in 
Virginia. 
 
KS: Wow. It’s incredible. 
 
BH: People ask all the time, well, is it the land? And I really have to be honest and say, no, it's 
not really the land. There's a lot of good land in North Carolina and Maryland and West Virginia. 
It's because in Virginia, the governors and the legislature enacted this new bill, called The Farm 
Winery Act, in 1980, and when they enacted that, I've the feeling that they said, you know, 
there is no culture of wine in Virginia… You know, after prohibition, what wine there was died 
out. 
 
KS: Uh huh. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
7 
 
 
BH: It was probably not very good wine. And so... the governors and legislature [pause] actually 
voted in funds for Virginia Tech, and that's why we're here today. 
 
KS: Right! 
 
BH: Because of Virginia Tech and the research. They've done research effort and promotion 
effort in our neighboring states. It's not as good as it is in Virginia. 
 
KS: Right. 
[00:10:47] 
KS: And that's been huge, I mean, obviously Virginia is gung-ho about supporting wine making 
because it's been a huge tourism/ economic development draw for the state and kind of just 
changed… 
 
BH: Oh absolutely… 
KS: … just everything. 
BH: Demographics have changed dramatically. Uh, when we moved to Loudoun County 7 years 
ago, there were 400 dairy farms. Now there's one dairy farm left. And they’re in the genetics 
business, that milk is a by-product for them. So they're not supporting themselves entirely with 
milk... they are selling genetics and embryos. 
 
KS: Can you say that to me again? How many were there? 
 
BH: There were 400 dairy farms in 1950, and now there is one. 
KS: Oh my goodness. 
BH: Um so… Loudoun County was mostly agricultural when we moved there, and now it is 
hugely… homes. Ah… We have saying in Loudoun County: homes grow very well on the soil in 
Loudoun County, but houses are the LAST crop that will grow. 
 
KS: Right. 
Winery Workers in Virginia

BH: So, uh, very telling. And I would say that 35 years ago, 40 years ago, everybody expected 
what happened in our neighboring eastern county: Fairfax, to happen in Loudoun. It would 
become just wall-to-wall houses. 
 
KS: Mmhmm. 
[00:12:07] 
BH: ...Really didn't happen. People, uh, loved the land in Loudoun County. And loved what we 
had and they said, we have to preserve this. So Loudoun County is a government, uh 
government, political entity, who said, we embrace wineries because we think that will do good 
things for Loudoun County. It will allow us to use the land for FARMING, and for agriculture, 
and keep it open. And not be totally wall-to-wall houses. 
 
KS: Yeah, I mean that's really uh, strategic, I guess, choice that they made, because you'll be 
surprised really by how much. There will be a LOT of density in one patch... 
 
BH: Uh huh. 
[00:12:52] 
KS: ...and then there'll be lots of old farms and things around it for a few miles and then 
another patch of density. Uh, yeah, it’s uh… But it's nice to have that open spaces... 
 
BH: Well trying to keep that open is extremely difficult… 
KS: Yeah. 
BH: Because of the value of houses that is... I can't tell you how many people want to buy our 
farm, all the land and turn it into houses. Yes. So we have to say, no, not right now. So… 
 
KS: Right sure. [Aside to videographer: OK how am I'm doing? -We actually have two more 
minutes. Okay, alright, good.] 
 
KS: Um so now, you have a family - a REAL family operation, which we've talked to quite a few 
people actually that have… I mean, every, every Virginia winery that I've encountered so far is a 
family operation… 
 
BH: Uh huh. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
9 
 
 
KS: But you definitely have your grown son now working for you who also does research and 
studies all the issues that are confronting growing grapes in addition to helping to run the 
operation there. What do you see coming down the road for the future of operations like 
yours? 
 
BH: Very interesting. Succession in this business is very important because there's a lot of great 
hair around. And we're not gonna be around forever, and we're getting older, it works getting 
hard. So succession is very important and I'm just so happy that my family, my son and my 
daughter are very interested in doing this in working off the farm, is actually keeping them 
supported and buying their insurance. And what we're trying to do our best at is growing the 
business to the point that they can move into the operation and support themselves... and not 
have to work full time, off the farm. 
 
KS: At another job, yeah. 
BH: That's exactly right. 
[00:14:52] 
KS: [someone talking in background, pauses] And we have a lot of tradition in that area, 
especially in Loudoun County, like Cox Farms. Family, agri-tourism businesses that have been 
able to maintain and go year to year to year and to the new generations. But yeah, there's a lot 
of pressure. 
 
BH: A lot of pressure, and I'm trying to think of they're not... I can't think of any growers in 
Loudoun County who’ve come from other types of farming into grapes. 
 
KS: Oh? 
 
BH: Generally, their model is for a very successful businessman- this is not true all over Virginia, 
but it's certainly true in Loudoun County- who've been very successful doing other things and 
decide to make wine, grow wine. The allure is strong. 
 
KS: Yeah. 
 
BH: Because we find that... I think that the market in Loudoun County - a little hyperbole- is the 
best market in the world. When you think about the demographics and the percentage of 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
10 
 
people who drink wine. We have other areas that PRODUCE more wine, but NOT the 
demographics that support that in our county. Ah, 20% of adult Americans drink wine at least 
once a week, and in the Washington area. I think that’s more like 50%, of the adult population 
drink wine once a week. 
 
KS: And I would say: maybe two or THREE times a week! [both laugh] 
[00:16:29] 
BH: Very true! It’s a low bar! 
 
KS: Yeah! No we are a heavy drinking area! Ok well now I think we have to wrap up just cause 
the next one is coming… 
 
BH: OK yeah. 
 
KS: … But it was so great to get the chance to talk to you and meet you! 
BH: Well thank you very much. 
KS: Well thank you! 
 
BH: Appreciate it… [trails off]
