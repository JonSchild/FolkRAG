THERE'S NOBODY KNOWS WHAT I KNOW. 
Sung with great success by JAXES GRAY, the celebrated Comic 
and Motto Vocalist. 
SOME people go peeping and prying about 
In a 
manner quite rude aid absurd, 
And then the next moment let everything out, 
And repeat every word they have heard ; 
But I 
know a 
great deal which I 
never reveal 
About what I've heard and I've seen; 
You may try all you know, you will find it " no go," 
For you can't get a 
word out of me." 
CHORUS. 
There's nobody knows what I 
know, 
And the secret I 
mean to keep well; 
There's nobody knows what I 
know, 
And I 
do not mean for to tell. 
Mr. Jones he is married, he looks worn and wan, 
And his wife is a 
terrible shrew, 
She flirts with the boarder, a 
single young man, 
While Jones all the work has to do. 
He's sent out for a 
walk, not allowed for to talk, 
While his wife and the boarder take tea; 
But what they are about while Jones is gone out, 
There's nobody knows only me. 
There's nobody knows, etc.

THE GREAT MEN THAT IRELAND HAS 
SEEN. 
As sung by the Great Motto Vocalist, NED BABEL 
Now, since I 
appear here, before you once more, 
I'll endeavor to gain your fair smile; 
Tho' years now have passed since I 
left the old shore, 
I 
still cling to the dear native Isle. 
And I'll sing of old Ireland, the laud of my birth, 
I 
will sing of the great men that's been; 
Whose deeds of renown shall shine round each heart, 
They were great men that Ireland has seen. 
CHORUS. 
Then here's to the sons of old Erin Go Bragh, 
May the memory of their names still be green, 
On sea, or on coast, let us drink off this toast, 
To the great men that Ireland has seen. 
O'Connell, you know, as all history does show, 
Was a 
statesman, whose equals were few; 
At the great Parliament, he did often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true. 
And Emmet, the martyr, he fought for our cause, 
Like a 
laurel, his name it keeps green; 
He died for his country and Liberty's laws, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Then here's to the sons, etc. 
And then we had Sarsfield who conquered each foe, 
And never was known for to yield; 
The foeman would quake, aye, and tremble and shake, 
When his war horse would enter the field; 
And then as for poets, there is no land I'm sure, 
Where such brilliant genius has been ; 
There was Grattan and Lover, and famous Tom Moore, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Then here's to the sons, etc. 
But though those great men have now passed away, 
Old Erin shall not be alone; 
We have men that would die for their country to-day, 
And a 
parliament -wish of their own. 
But may God guide and guard them to do what is right, 
May they harbor no rancour or spleen; 
But when honor demands them, they valiantly fight, 
Like the great men that Ireland has seen. 
Then here's to the sons, etc.

IN 
Scotland's fair land, o'er mountains and rills, 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day, 
In looking at the lads and lassies on the green, 
-In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her coming, but she has not come as 
yet ; 
The truth seems to dawn upon me plain; 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe her true— 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Jean, my bonnie Jean, come to your laddie once 
again ! 
They say you are false, but I 
still believe you mine, 
You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean. 
She said she would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain— 
In lands far away she does roam; 
Her promise she will keep; oh! break it not, my Jean; 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh I 
then let me not long wait, let me meet thee soon, my 
Jean, 
And ;the heavens will smile on our love, 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above. 
Oh ! Jean, my bonnie Jean, etc.

BABY ON THE BRAIN. 
By 
J. 
P. 
SKELLY. 
W ritten for and sung by TONY PASTOR. 
The music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, 
• 
New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
Copyright, 1879, by E. H. HARDING. 
I'VE often heard it said, that it's nice to be a 
father, 
And have a 
popsey-wopsey of your own; 
But I'd rather be excused from such a 
little bother, 
Experiences of others I 
have known. 
If any thing will show more plainly than another, 
That George is " off his crank," the reason's plain, 
He's just become a 
dad, and his wife's become a 
mother, 
And they both have got the " baby on the brain 1" 
CHORUS. 
The baby, the baby, it's nothing but the baby ! 
They bless it and caress it till it cries with pain; 
They dance it up and down, and kiss it for it's mother. 
Oh! it's awful to have a " baby on the brain !" 
How proudly does he tell all his friends that he's a 
daddy, 
And wonders why before they had not known ; 
He whistle and he sings, " with my folderolderaddy, 
And " remember, you have children of your own I" 
(1 ) 
BABY ON THE BRAIN.—Concluded. 
" 
Helen's Babies" have a 
charm, also " Other's People's 
Children," 
He's reads them over time and time again; 
Oh! ain't he got it bad, I'm afraid he won't recover 
From that ailment call'd the " baby on the brain !" 
The baby, the baby, etc. 
He's tickled most to death when his friends they all 
admire, 
And say he is the image of his dad; 
They say he's got his nose, and they anxiously inquire, 
" 
If he's troubled with the colly-wobbles' bad ?" 
The youngster doesn't mind the trouble he is making, 
He eats and sleeps, and sleeps and eats again; 
He's got the thing down fine, and with baby mirth he's 
shaking, 
For he knows his pop's got " baby on the brain !" 
The baby, the baby, etc. 
But the worst thing of it all, is the naming of the baby ; 
Mamma thinks " George Augustus" would be sweet; 
Papa does not agree, he says " Christopher Columbus ;" 
And to hear the names proposed is quite a 
treat. 
They finally agree, he's christened plain " Augustus !" 
Sweet baby, may your glory never wane. 
Now ladies (pray excuse me), when you are thus afflicted, 
I 
hope you'll not have " baby on the brain !" 
The baby, the baby, etc.

POLLY SAID SHE LOVED ME. 
As originally sung with great success by JAMES GRAY, the celebra-
ted Motto and Comic Vocalist. 
OH 
dear, I 
feel unhappy ; what shall I 
ever do ? 
I'm nearly broken-hearted; I 
don't mind telling you. 
The cause of all my sorrow, it's all through Polly Ann ; 
She has left me for a 
youngster who is a 
fluter- in the 
baud. 
I 
loved her to distraction, I 
did, upon my life ; 
She promised very shortly, that she'd become my wife. 
She said, " 0 
dearest Bill, a 
new silk dress you must buy 
For your little pet, and I'll love you, I'll love you till I 
die." 
a 
CHORUS. 
Polly said she loved me, but then she told a 
fib; 
She said that she never loved another, but she did. 
She's spoony on a 
bondman that plays upon a 
flute, 
And he charms her every night with his tootle, tootle, toot. 
I 
went and bought the ring, and the new silk dress too, 
Trimmed all around about with colors red and blue. 
She said it was a 
beauty and asked me with delight, 
If I'd take her up to Harry Miner's theatre that night. 
I 
said, " My little dear, I'll go any where you please," 
So off we went and took a 
seat, and I 
felt quite at ease, 
When a 
young man in the band winked his eye at Polly 
Ann; 
And Polly said, " 0 
Bill, what a 
very rude young man 1"

POLLY SAID SHE LOVED ME.—Oonoludeci. 
CHORUS. 
She goes there every night, she cannot keep away, 
She says she likes so very much to hear the music play, 
She's spoony on this bondman that plays upon the flute, 
And he charms her every night with his tootle, tootle, 
toot. 
Says I, " Now look you here, that game it will not suit, 
I 
know you are very spoony on the man that plays the 
flute." 
" 
Well so I 
am," said she, " and what you say is true; 
I 
love him far better than a 
stupid goose like you. 
know you are very good, Bill, upon the old Jews harp, 
But when he plays the flute it goes right through my 
heart." 
She goes there every night, etc. 
No doubt he thinks he's clever, and so does Polly too. 
I 
hope next time he plays he'll break his flute in two; 
Then Polly, perhaps, will leave him and come back to her 
Bill. 
I'll try to smash it somehow, upon my word I 
will. 
Oh there is Polly laughing at me in her sleeves. 
Now say you are only doing it just for to tease ; 
And never mind that young man with his tootle, tootle, 
toot, 
And I'll praction day and night to learn to play upon the 
. 
flute; 
She goes there every night, eta.

THE ITALIAN MOUNTAIN MAID. 
As sung with great success by JAMES GRAY. 
THERE is a 
pretty little maiden that I 
ever de:arly love, 
In Italy that bright and sunny land ; 
My life would be a 
pleasure, I 
Iv mild ask for nothing more, 
If she would share my heart and hand. 
For her father was a 
brigand on a 
lonely mountain pass, 
And with him on the mountain she does dwell. 
There is no titled lady in all Europe can surpass 
The dear Italian girl I 
love so well. 
CHORUS. 
Her father was a 
brigand on the mountain. 
She is as gentle as the daughter of an earl, 
And since she set me free, my heart will ever be 
A 
captive to the dear Italian girl. 
While roaming through the village 'neath the blue and 
sunny sky, 
A 
band of sturdy brigands bold and strong, 
Did capture me, and helpless, put a 
bandage on my eyes. 
A 
victim I 
was quickly led along. 
Five thousand pounds as ransom they said that I 
should 
pay, 
But that I 
was not rich enough to give, 
And only for the pleading of this little mountain maid 
They would not have permitted me to live. 
Her father was, etc. 
They put me in a 
dungeon where I 
thought that I 
should 
die, 
And while the brigand chief with all his band, 
Was plundering poor travelers, this lovely maid came 
nigh 
At gloomy night and by my side did stand. 
She tore my b(m.ls asunder, bade me rise and set me free, 
And from her father's coffers saved my gold, 
And while the tears of love and pity gladdened in her 
• 
eyes, 
The secret of our hearts was plainly told. 
Her father was, etc. 
PARODY ON TWENTY YEARS AGO. 
Written and Sung by Gus WILLIAM. 
I wandered by the village, Tom— 
sat beneath the tree ; 
And gazed upon that dear old jail, 
That oft sheltered you and me. 
But none was there to bail me out, 
At least they told me so; 
I 
was not acquainted with the judge, 
Like twenty years ago. 
The jail is altered some, dear Tom, 
It's larger now than then ; 
It's cells are twice as wide, dear Tom, 
To accommodate more men. 
The bell is there that used to ring, 
When to work we had to go; 
The music's just as sweet, dear Tom 
As twenty years ago. 
The boys are at the same old game, 
Of hooking on the sly; 
They stole a 
ham the other night. 
'Twas oft done by you and I. 
They're gambling, too, for money, Tom, 
At seven-up, you know; 
That good old game we loved so well 
Just twenty years ago. 
Down by the spring, close to the elm, 
You know poor William Way; 
I 
mean the old shoemaker, Tom, 
I 
saw him yesterday. 
Some wretch has kicked his stuffing out, 
lie's dying, sure but slow ; 
Just as the one you wolloped so, 
Died twenty years ago. 
My lids have long been dry, dear Tom, 
But tears came to my eyes; 
When 1 
think upon that good old hash 
And those dear old mutton pies. 
I 
went into Peet's to get a 
drink, 
But, Tom, 1 
started so, 
I 
had narry red- 1 
was dead broke-
Like twenty years ago.

THE DEVIL'S IN NEW JERSEY. 
Composed and sung by P. J. Dow-NET. 
LAST- Sunday morn I 
rose up, 
And I 
feeling kind of merry; 
Says I, 
have a 
good time, 
So I 
crossed the Jersey ferry. 
Butt never will I 
do the same, 
The consequence was frightening. 
But what can you expect of one, 
Filled up with Jersey lightning. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, you talk of this, you talk of that, 
You talk of places nosey, 
But by the—no, I 
will not swear— 
The devil's in New Jersey. 
I 
ran through mud up to my eyes, 
I 
never yet was lazy ; 
A 
big policeman scooped me in, 
And swore that I 
was crazy. 
I 
was surrounded in the cell 
By mosquitoes a-flying, 
When morning came, from loss of blood, 
I 
thought I 
was a-dying. 
Oh, you talk of this, etc. 
When morning came, before the judge, 
He looked on me with pity; 
Says he, young man, the sentence is, 
One hour to leave the city. 
I 
did not wait to hear the rest, 
You bet I 
wasn't noisy; 
When I 
arrived in York I 
cried, 
May the devil shoot New Jersey. 
Oh, you talk of this, etc. 
When I 
got home, my wife along 
With a 
big club was waiting, 
She said to lay a 
hand on me 
Her tender heart was breaking. 
We had it up and down the floor, 
At last I 
cried for mercy, 
She yelled you fool, go anywhere, 
But keep away from Jersey. 
Oh, you talk of this, etc.

DON'T BE IN A HURRY, 
BOYS. 
As 
sung by JAXES GRAY. 
THEY call me Benjamin, but why I 
cannot tell, 
For I 
am not simple for a 
man that's not a 
swell; 
I 
take things very easy as I 
pass my time away, 
Quietly and coolly as I 
jog along each day, 
1 
am never in a 
hurry, for no matter what I 
do, 
I 
always do it properly and try to do so too. 
So follow my example if you wish-to get along, 
And if you only do so yoa'll never go far wrong, (that is) 
CHORUS. 
Don't be in a 
hurry, boys, never be in liaste, 
Never pay for luxuries before you have a 
taste, 
For if you are disappointed you will have to suck your 
thumbs, 
So never buy the cradle, boys, before the baby comes. 
Now when I 
court the ladies, they like me as a 
rule, 
Because I 
do not grumble or make myself a 
fool, 
„ For I 
always do my courting in a 
proper style, 
And always get rewarded with a 
loving, pleasant smile; 
I 
know the way to please them, for I 
know what they all 
like 
And while the iron is hot is the proper time to strike, 
So I 
always am a 
favorite, no matter where I 
be, 
And if you will take my tip, boys, you'll be the same as 
me, (that is) 
Don't be in a 
hurry, etc. 
Now if you dream of marriage wait until you are wed 
Before you speculate your cash in mattresses and bed, 
For girls are very artful, and when they have gone to 
church, 
They have been known to change their minds, and leave 
men in the lurch. 
But when the happy knot is tied they then begin to buy 
Crockery and furniture, but do not on the sly 
Speculate in cradles first, for you would hang your head 
with shame, 
If you had the cradle waiting and the kid he never came, 
. (what a 
suck.) 
Don't be in a 
hurry, etc.

PERVERTED PROVERBS; 
OR, TUPPERNY 
PHILOSOPHY. 
Written and composed by FRED ALBERT. 
Sung nightly with great success by -HARRY W ALKER. 
M R. TUPPER has written a 
book, 
" 
Proverbial Philosophy" named, 
In its pages oft I 
look, 
For the sentences there are famed; 
There's a 
maxim for every day, 
Aud a 
motto for every man. 
If you wish to be happy and gay, 
The philosopher points the plan ; 
I 
have studied some of the proverbs wise, 
And trust I've not learnt them wrong, 
So list to the words of wisdom, 
And advice that flow through my song. 
Now where there's a 
way there's a 
will, 
That you must own is most true, 
A 
still head makes a 
wise tongue, 
You don't know what you can try till you do 
A 
mile is as good as a 
miss, 
Attend to these golden rules, 
And be careful between the grounds, 
Or else you'll fall on the stools ; 
Spare the child and spoil the rod 
If you would peace secure, 
And it's no use locking the horse up 
When you've lolt the stable door. 
A 
feast is as good as enough, 
So says this wonderful book, 
Waste and you never will want, 
For too many broths spoil the cook; 
Every day has its dog, 
There's wisdom in every word, 
So hold up your man like a 
head, 
For the early worm catches the bird, 
A 
bird in the bush is worth two in the hand ; 
So all you covetous elves, 
You must never look after the pence, then 
The pounds will run after themselves.

PERVERTED PROVERBS; 
OR, TUPPERNY 
PHILOSOPHY.—Concluded. 
Rolling moss gathers no stone, 
In this marvelous work I 
have read, 
Deep waters run very still, 
The least mended soonest said; 
Half a 
none's better than loaf; 
So let this be your plan, 
Never push the hill 
When its going down the man ; 
It's a 
very wise father knows his own child, 
And it ought to be written in gold 
That it's best to be off with the new love 
Before you get on with the old. 
When the wits in the wine's out, 
More speed less haste we learn, 
Once a 
child twice a 
man, 
So do a 
good can when you turn ; 
Those who live in stone houses 
Shouldn't throw glass, I'm sure, 
When love comes in at the window, 
Poverty flies from the door; 
Late to bed and late to rise, 
It is the truth I 
tell, 
Will make you unhealthy, not wealthy, nor wise, 
But make you look wretched as well. 
When the mice are away the cats play. 
So bear this well in mind, 
The proof of the eating is in 
The pudding you'll always find; 
Go worse and you farther will fare, 
So no more in the book will I 
dip, 
But remember there's many a 
lip 
Betwixt the cup and the slip ; 
Brevity is the wit of soul, 
So I 
will finish my strain, 
And sing to you the rest of my proverbs 
Whenever you call again,

THE BRIDGE. 
Words by H. W. LONGFELLOW. 
Music by Miss AI. LINDSAY. 
I 
stood on the bridge at midnight, 
As the clocks were striking the hour; 
And the moon rose o'er the city, 
Behind the dark church tow'r. 
And like the waters rushing, 
Among the wooden piers, 
A 
flood of thoughts came o'er me, 
That fill'd my eyes with tears. 
How often, oh ! how often, 
In the days that had gone by, 
I 
had stood on that bridge at midnight, 
And gazed on that wave and sky 1 
How often, oh I 
how often, 
In the days that had gone by, 
I 
had stood on the bridge at midnight, 
And gazed an that wave and sky! 
How often, oh ! how often, 
I 
had wished that ebbing tide, 
Would bear toe away on its bosom 
O'er the ocean wild and wide. 
For my heart was hot and restless, 
And my life was full of care; 
And the burthen laid upon me, 
Seemed greater than I 
could bear. 
But now it has fallen from me, 
It is buried in the sea ; 
And only the sorrows of others 
Throws its shadow Over me. 
Yet whenever I 
cross the river, 
On its bridge with wooden piers, 
Like the odor of brine from the ocean 
Comes the thought of other y••ars ; 
And for ever, and for ever, 
As long as the river flows, 
As long as the heart has passions, 
As long as life has woes, 
The moon and its broken reflection, 
And its shadows shall appear, 
As the symbol of love in } leaven, 
Aud its wavering image here.

I'm bothered, yes, I'm bothered, 
Completely perplexed; 
I'm the father of a 
little boy, 
I'm not happy, but I'm vexed. 
I 
have ninety-nine relation', 
And they nearly drive me wild, 
Both one and all, both great and small, 
They want to name the child. 
CHORUS. 
My wife she wants him Michael, her sister wants him 
Matt, 
Her brother wants him Charlie, whilst her aunty wants 
him Pat. 
Whilst her mother wants him Shamus, and my father 
-wants him Paul, 
I 
do declare, I 
don't know what I'll name the boy at all. 
'Twas only here this morning, 
My brother came from Troy, 
He swore by this, he swore by that, 
That be would name the boy. 
Says my wife's brother Darby, 
• He be hanged if that would do, 
And they jumped together on the floor, 
And had a 
bold set-to. 
My wife she wants him Michael, etc. 
Nest Sunday is the christening, 
And I'll tell you by the way, 
I'll have none of their connivings, 
I'm bound to have my say. 
They may call him this, and call him that, 
I 
don't give that for their call, 
I'm bound to call him Dennis, 
Or he'll have no name at all. 
My wife she may wants him Michael, etc.

GO IN AND WIN. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Written by W ALTER GREENAWAY, Composed by VINCENT DAVIES. 
and sung with great success by JAMES GRAY, Comic and Motto 
Vocalist. 
SOME people you'll find always railing at fate— 
Declaring with many a 
sigh 
That luck is against them, they cannot get on, 
And so it is useless to try. 
They're hopeful enough, and feel sure of success 
When they find things look all bright and fair, 
But the first little trouble that comes in their way 
They're sure to give up in despair. 
SPOKEN. — Despair! don't have such a word in your 
Webster; make up your mind, and do as I 
do, and— 
Go in and win, yes, go in and win, 
And don't give it up, mind, when 01106 you begin; 
Trouble may meet you, 
And try to defeat you, 
But don't let it beat you ; no, go in and win. 
Now plenty you'll find always talking about 
, 
The wonderful things they will do, 
And if talking would do it there isn't a 
doubt 
That they would astonish a 
few. 
They're always intending to do something great, 
But not quite sure how to begin; 
And while they are thinking how it's to be done 
Another will go in and win.

GO IN AND WIN.—Concluded. 
SPOKEN.--By 
Jove! it's no use standing looking on in 
these sharp times, you must keep the steam up and with 
a 
dash— 
Go in and win, etc. 
I've oft seen a 
fellow in love with a 
girl 
And wishing to make her his lcife, 
But he tells you he hardly dare think about that, 
For she's rather above him in life. 
Now if you love the girl, and you think she loves you, 
Her station don't matter a 
pin; 
Just make up your mind that you'll have her, my 
boy, 
And you've only to go in and win. 
SPOKEN. — Faint heart, you know (old as the saying is) 
never yet won fair lady, so always make up you mind, as 
I 
do, to— 
Go in and win, etc. 
Whatever you start in, now make up you mind 
That you will not be left in the rear, 
Be certain you must keep well up to the fore 
' 
If the prizes of life you will share. 
Fortune, you know, only favors the brave, 
So, if with a 
stout heart you begin, 
There's no fear, I 
am sure, but what you'll pull thro', 
. 
You've only to go in and win. 
SPOKEN.—That's good advice gratis, so I 
hope you'll 
follow it, and—

I 
DON'T LIKE A CUR AT MY HEELS. 
Words and Music by FRED BOULARD. 
As sung by NED BARRY, with great success. 
I 
LIXE honest pluck in this warfare of life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet ; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear ; 
Yet ' tis better to know you're prepared for the worst, 
Than tremble like children, with fear. 
CHORUS. 
I 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels; 
I 
can fight with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man who had none; 
Hard words may be used, yet I 
like him the most 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wrong, I 
can cure the foul slander at once, 
And destroy every venomous part; 
Yet I 
reel when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
I 
do like a 
man, etc. 
So, behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
If you can't do him no good, do him no harm; 
If you don't like back-biting, don't do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm. 
We all have to live, so let's try and make life 
A 
good open field for the race, 
And if you have cause of complaint against man, 
GO 
tell him right straight to his-face. 
I 
do like a 
man, etc.

I COULD TELL IT IF I FELT IT IN THE 
DARK. 
As sung with great success by JAMES GRAY. 
THERE is a 
thousand funny things a 
comic singer sings, 
To you no doubt revealing, 
And really on my word it is seldom that I've heard 
A 
song that touches on the art of feeling. 
There is a 
power, understand, in the grip of the hand, 
As one man to another may remark. 
And oft you'll hear them say of the things they see by 
day— 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark. 
CHORUS. 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark, 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark; 
I 
like it very much, I 
know it by its touch, 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark. 
Sometimes we chance to hold some silver or some gold, 
That may be the case with many; 
But he is very poor who never from his store 
Can afford to finger more than a 
penny. 
Sometimes we have to spend and ofttinaes to lend, 
And all of us do like a 
jolly lark; 
But what so be the coin on which my fingers join, 
I 
could tell it if I 
felt it in the dark. 
I 
could tell it, etc. 
The other day I chanced to meet a 
maiden fair and 
sweet, 
Beneath an old tree so shady, 
She pledged to me her vow, I 
will not tell you now; 
Some day I 
mean to wed that little lady. 
I 
tell you it is bliss to steal from her a 
kiss 
While roaming together in the park, 
And as my arm was placed in a 
circle round her waist, 
For I'm always in to have a 
jolly lark. 
I 
could tell it, etc. 
Sung by Miss M CID HART with much success. 
I'm an aristocrat, 
Make no mistake in that. 
I 
come of a 
line 
Remarkably fine, 
For troubles I 
do not care; 
For pleasure's my aim, 
Delight is my game, 
And I 
adore the fair. 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
swell, 
You can tell, 
And behave of course as such, 
Close cut hair, 
Elbows square, 
With my toothpick and my crutch. 
With glass enclosed in eye, 
I 
scan the passers by; 
I've pantomime cuffs, 
And ready rebuffs, 
For cads familiar; 
Although really glad, 
I 
say not bad, 
When leaving drawl, " Ta-ta." 
I'm a 
swell, eta.

THE CRUTCH AND TOOTHPICK.—Concluded. 
To your true aristocrat 
All luxuries come pat, 
The driest champagne, 
The softest La Rose, 
The tastiest caviar; 
.Havana for us 
Especially STOWS 
Its exquisitest cigar. 
I'm a 
swell, etc. 
Though we're aristocrats, 
At fighting we're no fiats, 
For when America's name 
The foe would defame, 
Swell dandies tho' we be, 
In meeting the foe 
No swelldom we show, 
So owns the enemy ; 
Staunch and true, 
Red or blue, 
Sure our courage isn't Dutch. 
And the sword 
We can wield 
With more vigor than the crutch. 
I'm a 
swell, 
You can tell, 
And behave of course as such; 
Close cut hair, 
Elbows square, 
With ray toothpick and my crutch.

JOHNNY, 
TAKE THE CHILD ACROSS YOUR 
KNEE. 
AS 
sung by CHARLEY LADENDORF. 
I'M a 
hardy working man and I 
do the best I 
can, 
When I 
come home from labor every day; 
My wife at me does stare when I 
sit in the chair, 
She whispers in my ear and to me says: 
Our darling little boy the neighbors do annoy, 
He smashed in Mrs. Murphy's window pane ; 
She says she'll git a 
cop if the rascal doesn't stop, 
Then she'll roll her arms around me and exclaim : 
CHORUS. 
Johnny, take the -child across your knee, 
To-day he's been a 
bad boy to me; 
Learn hini the golden rule and send him off to school, 
Arrah, Johnny, take the child across your knee. 
This darling son of mine is so gentle and so kind, 
He's always playing " Duck upon the Rock ;" 
When he goes out to play, sure he's always led astray 
By all the little gossoons on the block. 
They take him on the street, and every Turk he meets, 
He fires a 
brick at him and runs away ; 
Then the neighbors will complain and say that I'm to 
blame, 
Then my darling wife to me will say: 
Johnny, take the child, etc. 
My heart is nearly broke, since my boy commenced to 
smoke, 
You'll find him on the corner picking stumps; 
He's acquainted with the slang, he's in with all the gang, 
He's always playing base ball on the dump. 
But now he's got so tall and he takes in every ball, 
And hangs out with the loafers every day ; 
My wife is nearly wild since she lost her darling child, 
When I 
return from work no more she'll say: 
Johnny, take the child, etc. 
BOSTON MARit. 
Originally and only sung by JACK CONROY. 
OH, I'm one that's fond of pleasure; 
It is my greatest pride, 
And in my hours of leisure 
To go toddling thro' the glide. 
0, give to me the outside sport, 
It is so gay and airy, 
For all the boys around the park 
They call me Boston Mary. 
CHORUS. 
With my tita la, oh, tita la I 
Wherever I 
may go, 
I'm one that's fond of pleasurs, 
Is Boston Mary, oh. 
With my tita la, my tita la ! 
Wherever I 
may lark, 
You bet I 
have the best costume 
Of any of the girls in the park. 
I 
have a 
charming sweetheart, 
And Joey, that's his name; 
At summer time often on the lawn 
We play the croquet game. 
Oh, do I 
not admire it ? 
My chance I 
would not miss; 
Before my petty parts with me 
His darling he must kiss. 
With my tita la, etc. 
One evening, while out rambling— 
'Twas shortly after dark— 
My Joe and I 
went meandering 
Up to Washington Park. 
While walking around the fountain 
We met with a 
parcel of loons. 
One asked me to pay a 
visit with him 
To one of the " tea-rooms." 
With my tita la, etc.

111cCUSKER, CLOSE YOUR VALVE. 
As originally sung with great success by the ce:ebrated Irish 
Comedian, J. L. DEmpszy. 
0 
I'm a 
dacent Irishman, and I 
lately crossed the ocean; 
I 
have a 
very great desire to always keep in motion ; 
Perhaps you people think that is a 
funny notion; 
For my name is Mike McCusker, from Mayo. 
When first I 
landed here, sure everything looked queer, .
1) 
I 
stopped to read each sign I 
saw from the Battery to thitAl 
Square, 
When a 
friend of mine did shout, " Arrah ! what are you k 
about, 
For goodness sake, McCusker, close your valve." 
CHORUS. 
Whenever I 
go out the boys are sure to shout, 
Stag her, Galway Sluggers, or I'd like to get- a 
sprout. 
And every word I 
spake such fun of me they make, 
And they say to me, McCusker, close your valve. 
A 
week ago to-day down Broadway I 
was walking, 
And as I 
passed the gang I 
overheard them talking, 
Says one, who is his Nobs, he is forever gawking; 
Says another, that's McCusker, from Mayo. 
Now this made me very mad, for I 
thought it was too bad 
To try to make a 
tarrier of a 
bouncing Irish lad. 
Says one, " You're off your base, take a 
shave and wash 
your face; 
And for heaven's sake, McCusker, close your valve 1" 
Whenever I 
go, etc. 
I 
board on Water street with my uncle, Patrick Rooney, 
And the girls all plague me so they almost drive me 
looney. 
There is Nancy Macintee, on me she is quite spoouy; 
She's the fairest little damsel in the laud. 
If she only would consent, it's then we would get wed; 
But if she doesn't have me, arrab devil a, tear I'll shed, 
So I 
think I've sung enough, so no 
I'll shut my head 
Before some one of ye tells me close my valve. - 
Whenever I 
go, etc.

I KNOW a 
little rosebud, 
A 
light weight of sixteen, 
Wid bait where warmest colors blaze, 
And heart where truth do beam. 
She have a 
cheek where freshness dwells, 
She'd spoil up any man. 
A 
lump of carrot gold is she, 
This little Muggy Ann. 
CHORUS. 
This little Maggy Ann, 
This rosy Maggy Ann, 
She'd strike you blind dumb, this sweet little plum, 
This slick, and entirely bewilderin' young girl, 
They call little Maggy Ann. 
This rosy Muggy Ann, 
A 
Vaynus is she, whatever that may be, 
Is little Maggy Ann. 
She used to be a 
working-man, 
Down in a 
laundry fine, 
And wrestle wid discouraged shirts, 
Till wid new life they'd shine, 
But she bekem high-tony, as 
Would any other man, 
And now a 
pure rale Irish nurse, 
Is little Maggy Ann. 
Thislittle Maggy Ann, etc. 
The babies all she washes, 
And then irons them out well, 
And fetches them a 
lively slap, 
If out of tune they yell. 
A 
fancy night-cap then she wears, 
This French Hibernian, 
Then to the Park wid all the babes, 
Glides little Maggy Ann. 
This little Maggy Ann, etc.

WHEN McGUINESS GETS A JOB. 
Sung by O'NEIL and CONROY. 
LIST winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reily, did you say ? 
Well, ' tis, myself that knows it, for it's many's the day 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat be-hind the wall; 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all; 
The Politicians promised him work on the Boulevard . 
To handle a 
pick and shovel and, throw dirt on the 
cart. 
Ah, six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly 
get, 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him - 
yet. 
CHORUS. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily, don't give away to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, new bonnets and neW shoes ; 
As for me I'm done a 
crying, no more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times gets better when McGuiness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, the devil take them, why didn't they stay 
at home, 
Sure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our 
own; 
They come out like bees in summer-time and sworn for 
to stay; 
WHEN McGUINESS GETS A JOB.—Concluded. 
The contractors they have' hundreds for forty cents a 
day, 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and 
slush, 
But there's one thing in their 
favor, Italians they 
never do get lush ; 
No, they always bring their money home, taste no gin or 
wine, 
And that one thing I'd like to say of your old man and 
mine. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, etc. 
Ah! the spring-time now is coming we'll all have plenty 
work, 
McGuiness will go back to his trade, shure he's a 
hand-
some clerk. 
You should see him climb the ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three-cornered 
' 
box. 
The boss is always bawling, Hi! there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes upward, don't let no mortar drop ; 
Ab. 
the old man he is always careful, nothing he let's 
fall, 
The divil a 
word you'd hear him say to my old. man at 
all.

WHY DID SHE LEAVE H ER JEREMIAH? 
As originally sung with success by JAMES GRAY, the celebrated 
Motto and Comic Vocalist. 
W HEN I 
was in clover I 
loved a 
fair maid, 
With eyes of sweet dark-blue; 
She seem'd oh so fond I 
ne'er felt afraid 
She ever might prove untrue; 
But when trouble came she took herself oft 
As often false woman will do; 
Tho' her face was her fortune she married a 
toff,. 
Yes, she married the Lord knows who ? 
CHOMIS. 
0 
why did she ieave her Jeremiah ! 
Why did she go without saying adieu ; 
When troitble came she look'd much higher, 
Isn't it funny what money will do ? 
While I 
am in an attic in Cherry street, 
She has a mansion in Union square, 
While I 
tramp about with boots down at heel, 
She rides with her carriage and pair; 
She can ruu up a 
bill for a 
thousand or so, 
If she has not the cash at the time, 
But as for poor me, I'd be thankful to know 
Where some one would lend me a 
dime. 
CHORUS. 
She goes to Long Branch with a 
splendid turn-
out, 
In a 
style that Nobs even scan; 
I 
go to Long Branch on a 
freight train, of course, 
Or else on the top of a 
van.

THE COLORADO BEETLE COLLARED AT 
LAST. 
W ords and music by I. 
F. 
MoAnDLE, and sung by JAMES GRAY. 
THE Colorado beetle is the bore of the day, 
For it's in everybody's mouth, and everybody's way. 
Some simpleton imported it to have a 
little fun, 
But if the farmers catch him won't he have to cut and 
run. 
This beetle is a 
little insect that eats everything, 
Potatoes, beans, or cabbages, whatever you can bring. 
Its appetite .is awful, if it ever makes a 
stand - 
There won't be one potato left in the whole of Paddy's 
land. 
CHORUS. 
I 
can do with a 
cockroach, I 
can do with a 
snail, 
A 
spider crawling down my back will never turn me pale ; 
But of all the little insects which the world has ever 
cussed, • 
This Colorado beetle is the wickedest and wust. 
Its progeny increases at a very shocking rate, 
A 
thousand million billions will soon overrun the State ; 
The farmer cannot kill it, for it laughs at his quick lime, 
And while it has a 
pratee left it spends a 
jolly time. 
Big vegetable marrows, turnips, oak trees by the roots 
It plucks up ; plows and harrows too, it swallows like 
boots. 
The great sea serpent to this beetle is a 
regular fool, 
The Yankees say it lately swallowed up an infant school. 
I 
can do with a 
cockroach, etc. 
I 
live in furnished lodgings, my landlady kept a 
cat, 
When Colorado beetles came it soon cleared out of that. 
My coal and candles used to go, the cat she'd always 
blame, 
But though poor pussy has skedaddled, things go off the 
same ; 
My tea, my sugar, and my bread in quantities I've 
missed, 
A 
quart of Irish whiskey figures on the missing list. 
When I 
remarked to Mrs. Brown, " this cannot be poor 
puss," 
She says, " these Colorado beetles collar things much 
uss 
I 
can do with a 
cockroach, etc.

CAVALIER.—Concluded. 
I'm a 
great pedestrian walker, 
My record dates far back, 
I'd be sure to beat O'Leary, 
If they'd let me on the track. 
I'm known at all the races, 
My bets are all the boast, 
can always name the winning horse 
Before he leaves the post. 
All politicians seem to know me, 
They shake my hand with pride, 
For they know my great influence 
In elections turn the tide. 
All the Congressmen and Senators 
Admire me everywhere, 
And Waltzingliam McSweeney, 
Some say will be your mayor. 
Waltzingliani McSweeLey, etc. 
At Rockaway or Long Branch 
I'm great Mogul of all; 
And the landlords of the big hotels 
They fight to have me call. 
And all the bathers upon the beach, 
They watch me do the grand, 
And the Lords and Dukes and ladies fair, 
Feel proud to shake my hand. 
When-I 
walk out in my bathing-suit, 
And step upon the beach, 
The opera- glasses are levelled at me, 
As far as the eye can reach; 
And your Lords and Dukes are no where, 
Like a 
flower they fade away, 
When Waltzingliam McSweeney 
Steps into the boiling sea.

THE ROLLICKING RAKE. 
W ritten and sung by BOB JOHNSON. 
I 
AM a 
regular rollicking rake ; I 
am always happy and 
gay. 
Though money I've none, I revel in fun, so merrily 
night and day. 
I'm always jolly, and take a delight in every kind of 
game. 
My heart's as light as a 
feather to-night, though I 
haven't 
a 
rap to my name. 
CHORUS. 
Night and day I'm happy and gay, 
Heavy in debt, and never can pay ; 
The fact is known by every one, 
I 
haven't much money, but lots of fun. 
To get to the ball sometime ago, I 
wish I 
never had tried, 
Cash for a 
ticket of course I'd none, but managed to pass 
But how I 
got out is a 
puzzle to me, for, much to my 
surprise, 
A 
tall swell there, who got up the affair, soon bung'd up 
both my eyes. 
Night and day, etc. 
Some people meet trouble half way, but yet that's not 
the case with me. 
I 
take matters cool if in trouble I 
get, whenever I'm out 
for a 
spree. 
But should a 
chap block my brand new tile, or rumple 
my Sunday clothes, 
It's ten to one that this boiserous fun will end in a 
patch'd-up nose. 
Night and day, etc. 
I've had some plaguy visits to-day from tradesmen, over 
a 
score,

GIVE ME THE GIRL THAT IS TENDER AND 
TRUE. 
Sung with great SUCCCS3 by TIMMY W ALKER. 
My. tastes they are simple, I 
care not for wealth, 
So long as I'm blest with a 
good share of health. 
I'll tell you ray wants, and I 
think you'll agree 
That it takes very little to satisfy me ; 
I 
am not ambitious, and ne'er spent an hour 
In pining for place, or position, or power, 
No envy have I 
for our rulers above, 
But I 
glory in gaining true friendship and love. 
a . 
CHORUS. 
Give me the girl that is tender and true, 
Give me the friend that is faithful to you, 
Give me a 
glass, a 
pipe, and a 
song, 
Then I'll be as happy as the days are long. 
In search of enjoyments, wherever we roam, 
There's none that can equal the sweet joys of home ; 
If there we have kindness, contentment, and rest, 
Domestic felicity I 
think the best ; 
Let some seek for fame upon far distant fields, 
And find what an empty illusion it yields, 
Let others take pleasure however they may, 
still enjoy life in my own quiet way. 
Give me the girl, etc. 
'Tis no use to worry and flurry I 
find, 
To gather up hoards that we must leave behind, 
Regrets will not alter our station a 
jot, 
So try to be happy whatever your lot ; 
Remember that happiness does not depend 
Upon the amount of cash you can spend, 
Those days are most pleasant, and so are the nights, 
That are passed in the simplest and purest delights. 
• Give me the girl, etc. 
You'll own ere my song to a 
finish is brought, 
True friendship and love they are not to be bought, 
In them you can trust whate'er may befall, 
And that's why I 
prize them as dearer than all ; 
The pipe has a 
soothing effect on the mind, 
The glass and the song cheer the heart when combined, 
With friends ail around, and the girl you admire, 
What else is there left in this world to desire ? 
Give me the girl, etc.

THE BURNING GRANITE MIL% 
Ara.--g
, 
Wreck of the London." 
Sung with great applause by JOHNNY GIBBONS. 
TUE wheel goes gently round, my friends, and time is 
on the wing, 
A 
leisure moment I'll employ and a 
song to you I'll sing 
About those poor unfortunate souls, on the morning 
bright and still, 
That leaped for life from the burning, out of the Granite 
mill. 
'Twas the 19th of September, the morn was bright and 
clear, 
The wheel went round, the people worked with a 
good 
and faithful cheer; 
But hark ! the cry of fire is heard from voices loud and 
strong, 
The alarm horn seventy-four rang out, 'tis the Granite 
Number One. 
The work of desolation the fire had begun, 
From bolt to wheel like lightning, from room to room it 
rnn; 
The people hastening in their fright and working with a 
will, 
Trying to save the unhappy souls from the burning 
Granite mill. 
Up in the highest windows they clung in wild despair, 
Some shrieking in their utter woe and others knelt in 
prayer; 
They jumped from that sixth story which made the strong 
hearts chill, 
To gaze on the dead and dying around the Granite mill. 
The sight was sad and mournful, most piercing were the 
cries, 
The desperate and daring stood by with tearful eyes • 
To see the young and beautiful perish as they looked' 
on, 
As the fire-fiend was raging in Granite Number One. 
Oh I 
where are my three children ? the widowed. mother 
cried, 
Where is Katy , Maggie, Annie ? they were my only pride. 
Thus mournfully this mother wept as a group moved 
slowly On, 
Bearing the bodies of her children from the Granite 
Number One. 
PERISHED IN TT-T-F1 
SNOW. 
Words and Music by EDDIE Fox. 
As sung by FIIED. W ALTZ, of Sweatnani 
MinE•trols. 
'TwAvs on a 
stormy winter's night, 
The snow was falling fast; 
A 
mother and two little babes 
Were wandering through the blast. 
Still clinging to their mother's breast, 
The little ones would cry, 
Please, mamma, won't you make us warm ? 
0, mamma, we will die. 
CHORUS. 
Toll the village bell, 
Let all good people know, 
'Twits on that dreadful stormy night 
Three perished in the snow. 
When morning dawned the sun came out, 
The snow was melting fast; 
Three darling forms lay side by side, 
In one fond, loving clasp. 
A 
farmer heard the sad, sad news, 
That made him weep to know, 
That from his house not twenty rods, 
Three peiished in the snow. 
Toll the village bell, etc.

OVER THE GARDEN WALL. 
OH, 
my love stood under the walnut tree, 
Over the garden wall. 
She whispered and said she'd be true to me, 
Over the garden wall. 
She'd beautiful eyes and beautiful hair, 
She was not very tall, so she stood on a 
chair 
And many a 
time I 
have kissed her there, 
Over the garden wall. 
CHORUS. 
Over the garden wall, 
The sweetest girl of all, 
There never was yet such eyes of jet, 
And you may bet I'll never forget 
The night our lips in kisses met, 
Over the garden wall. 
But her father stamp'd, and her father raved, 
Over the garden wall, 
And like an old madman he behaved, 
Over the garden wall. 
She made me a 
bouquet of roses red, 
But immediately I 
popped up my head, 
He gave me a 
bucket of water instead, 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc 
One day I 
jumped down on the other side, 
Over the garden wall, 
And she bravely promised to be my bride, 
Over the garden wall. 
But she screamed in fright, " Here's father, quick ! 
I 
have an impression he's bringing a 
stick 
But I 
brought the impression of half a 
brick 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc. 
But where there's a 
will there's always a 
way, 
Over the garden wall. 
There's always a 
night as well as a 
day, 
Over the garden wall. 
We hadn't much money, but weddings are cheap, 
So while the old fellow was snoring asleep, 
With a 
lad and a 
ladder she managed to creep 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc. 
BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES. 
Written and composed by FREDERIC 31.4.cciats. 
PRETTY little flowers in plenty grow; 
Buttercups and daisies! 
Buttercups and daisies! 
All among the grass, so gayly, 0 ! 
Buttercups and daisies grow. 
Thorns and weeds our lives surround, 
Naught for that care I. 
Brightest blossoms still abound, 
And content am I. 
Pretty little, eta. 
Pretty little children love to play, 
All among the daisies, 
The buttercups and daisies; 
With their happy faces bright and gay, 
Pretty little flowers are they. 
Though this life is full of care, 
Naught for that care I, 
Grief and joy alike we share, 
And content am I. 
Pretty little, etc. 
LOVE, BEAUTIFUL LOVE; 
OR, MISS MARY MAY. 
A good-naturedly-satirical young lady, who will chat pleasantly, and sing 
an unsentimental song. 
Written and composed by FREDERIC M ACCABE. 
LovE, beautiful love! is a 
vision of joy 
To the blushing maid and the bashful boy; 
And a 
sweet little cottage or humble tent 
Is all they want—but the rent !— the rent! 
Is the landlord's cry, 
And he won't take a 
tear, nor he won't take a 
sigh. 
Love is beautiful love when the baby plays, 
And charms the fond pair with its sweet little ways ; 
Then gold could not purchase its tiny toes, 
But the shoemaker calls, and before he.goes, 
Suppose he will 
Not leave the house till you've paid his bill. 
Love was once a 
mischievous boy, ' tis said, 
Without shoes on his feet or cap on his head, 
But he's very genteel, and it must be confessed, 
Love's a 
very nice boy when he's fed and well dress'd, 
Then love will bring 
t.bonsand joys in a 
wedding ring.

And step so firm and grand, 
While down the street, the music sweet, 
Plays " Dear Old Paddy's Land -;" 
Oar colors wave and sabres flash 
Bright in the morning sun, 
While bouquets rare are sticking in 
The muzzle of each gun. 
CHORUS. 
March away, mind, I

Ain't this fine ? 
Don't spread your feet so, Paddy Carey; 
Now with care, dress up there. 
No wonder that the people cheer

For keeping time or straighter lines 
No better marching there;

And as the end they near • 
We'll soothe their hearts with dearest words,

W HILE lilacs bloom in yonder lane, 
Sweet resort of bird and bee, 
Ere the sun forsakes the plain, 
One I

Where the linnet fluttereth low, 
Where the gate swings to and fro, 
Where the wild white roses grow, 
Agnes will be waiting me. 
CHORUS. 
My bonny Agnes will be waiting. 
Waiting at the gate for me. 
My bonny Agnes will be waiting, waiting, 
Waiting at the gate for me. 
To paint her beauty, words would fail ; 
Nature's own sweet child she seems, 
Leaning o'er yon time- worn rail, 
Lost in Love's delicious dreams. 
When to her this ring I 
show, 
Fast the crimson tide will flow, 
O'er her face and breast of snow. 
Stay, fair sun thy parting beams. 
My bonny Agnes, etc. 
She beard my step, one joyful start, 
One low cry of ecstasy, 
As I 
pressed her to my heart, 
'Neath the bright plumed lilac tree; 
Then we wandered side by side, 
As the purple twilight died ; 
And I 
whispered to my bride, 
0 how blest our home will be.

YOU'RE PAR TOO YOUNG TO TAFT: CARE 
OF YOURSELF. 
I 
WENT to a 
party a 
few months ago, 
While there I 
got sweet on a 
girl, you must know, 
She played the piano, occasionly sung, 
I 
admired her talent, she being so young. 
The party broke up as the clock it struck four, 
I 
ask'd if I 
might see her home to the door, 
She blush'd like the rose and these words then did say, 
" 
No, thank you, dear sir, I 
can find my own way." 
SPOKEN. —I 
said very likely, my dear, but remember--
You're far too young to take care of yourself, 
Far too young to take care of yourself, 
Don't be so silly, you simple young elf, 
You're far too young to take care of yourself. 
The fog was so dense that you hardly could see 
A 
man from a 
horse or a 
horse from a 
tree, 
And as she had something like two miles to go, 
I 
said if you venture you'll rue it, I 
know. 
The more I 
persuaded the more she refused. 
At last I 
said, Miss, you can go if you choose,

But if you'll allow me I'll show you the way, 
And then to the girl these words I 
did say— 
You're far too young to take, etc. 
She started for home and I 
followed behind, 
But losing her way she soon altered her mind, 
And when she saw me she said, Pardon me, pray, 
If you but respect me, sir, show me the way. 
a 
I 
walked by her side and we soon reached the door. 
Her parents they thanked me a 
thousand times o'er, 
Invited me in there a 
short time to stay, 
And once more to her these words I 
did say--
You're far too young to take, ete • 
I 
said if you need a 
protector for life, 
With your parents' consent I 
will make you my wife, 
My income is over three hundred a 
year, 
And if you haV'e me you have little to fear. 
Her father said no, but her mother said yes, 
She's not going to lose such a 
chance, I 
confess; 
In three months from now you can take her away, 
And then to the girl these words she did say— 
You're far too young to take, etc.

THERE'S ALWAYS A SEAT IN THE PARLOR

Music published by F. 
W . 
HELMICK, No. 50 Fourth St., Cincinnati, 0. 
Tun subject to-night of my song is love, 
Something quite heavy to bear; 
When that being you love to you proves untrue, 
For none else in the world do you care. 
The lady I 
love is an angel divine, 
, 
And with her my life I 
would share; 
13nt whene'er I 
go to her house her to see, 
There is always somebody there. 
SPOKEN.—I 
explained, the matter to her the other 
evening, and when I 
had finished, she looked into my 
face this way, and said, that's nothing--
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there ; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair. 
I 
went to her house one evening last week, 
You may easily judge my surprise ; 
I 
was just going to enter the hallway when 
I 
met that which opened my eyes.

THERE'S ALWAYS A SEAT IN THE PARLOR 
FOR YOU.—Concluded. 
For there stood a 
man both tall and stout, 
Who said, what do you wish here ? 
Grabbed me by the neck, threw me out on the walk, 
And the last words I 
could hear while there was— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
No matter how many are there ; 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
When you come around here have a 
care. 
Now the young men I 
go with all gave me the laugh, 
My troubles to them I 
have told; 
They say I 
am foolish to speak to her, 
Because I've been so often sold. 
No matter how often I 
have or may be, 
My love I 
shall never expel, 
I'll follow her, yes, both day and night, 
And my burdensome tale I 
will tell. 
SPOKEN.—Yes ; 
I 
shall haunt her day and night if it's 
only to hear her say— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a

All Rights Reserved. 
NOT long ago while walking out 
Along the Avenue, 
I 
tumbled on a 
big surprise, 
It struck me as quite new. 
The boys and girls were in their g. 
It was about midday, 
I 
thought it shockingly absurd, 
Whene'er I 
heard them say : 
CHORUS. 
Good evening, this evening. 
Are you going to the ball ? 
Not this evening, good evening, 
Good evening, one and all. 
Fine evening, thisi evening, 
This evening's very warm, 
Good evening, this evening, 
Good evening, take my arm. 
While wondering and pondering 
Just what it all could mean, 
I 
chanced to look around and spy 
The sweetest little queen. 
She looked so real bewitching sweet 
I 
sighed and said, oh dear, 
She sailed up, seized me by the nose 
And whispered in my ear : 
Good evening, etc% 
We strolled along, both side by side, 
She said I 
was her mash, 
Then dragged me in a 
restaurant 
And ordered up some hash. 
She must have fasted forty days, 
I'm sure she ate her fill, 
She sweetly smiled, I 
was beguiled 
And settled up the bill. 
Good evening„ete.

W HEN I landed at Castle Garden, 
About ten years ago, 
I

In Cherry street below. 
'Twas there I

Wid a

It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day.

Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout, 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gayly did turn out 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had funny things to say 
To Mike and Lena Callihan, 
Upon their wedding day. 
Ring a

There was August Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry Ciselmyer, 
With all my wife's relations, 
And Cohn, the old clothes buyer.

But the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to kiss the bride.

HIGH WATER PANTS. 
Sung by O'NEIL and CONROY. 
My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
I'm an Irishman as you can see, , 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in the tree. 
But the gang that stands on the corner 
Are trying the steps and the dance, 
They shout out whenever I'm passing, 
" 
There is O'Brien with his High Water Pants." 
CHORUS. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the High Water Pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan ; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nigger came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
highland clog dance, 
And he gave out a 
gag and conundrum 
About O'Brien with his High Water Pants. 
They tell me to go over, etc. 
T'other night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock, 
We thought we'd drop into Geoghan's 
For a 
glass of his Rye and Rock. 
When the gang says there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bartender shot me a 
glance; 
Hold yourtongue, says he to the loafers, 
That' O'Brien with his High Water Pants. 
They tell me to go over, etc.

COMIC SONG AND CHORUS . 
Written, composed and sung by CHAS. H. DUNCAN. 
Published in sheet music by R. A. SAALFIELD, 839 Broadway, N. Y, 
SOME time ago, as you must know, 
I 
met a 
charming girl, 
She looked so very pretty 
That my brain got in a 
whirl. 
She wore a 
small shell bonnet, 
That became her well indeed, 
But when she slipped down upon the ice, 
My heart for her did bleed. 
CHORUS. 
Don't blame me for I 
didn't do it, 
Don't blame me for I

Don't blame me for I 
didn't do it, 
I 
am not to blame. 
(
Repeat.) 
She begged that I'd excuse her, 
Which of course I 
quickly done, 
She handed me a 
scented card, 
The'charmer I 
had won; 
She stated that her father was 
A 
very peculiar man, 
Was training for a 
prize fight. 
And his name was Reckless Dan. 
Don't blame me, etc. 
I 
stuck to her just like.' leech, 
We're married most a 
year, 
On good terms with her father, 
And have nothing now to fear. 
We've got a 
baby, it's a 
girl, 
She is her mother's joy, 
But I'm not fond of girls at all— 
I'd rather have a 
boy. 
Don't blame me, etc.

SIX FEET OF EARTH. 
I'LL relate to you now of the world and its ways, 
And many strange people we meet; 
From the rich man that rolls in his millions of wealth, 
To the poor starving wretch on the street. 
A 
man may be poor, and in tatters and rags, 
Though we ne'er should affect to despise, 
But think of the adage, and remember, my friends, 
That six feet of earth makes us all of one size. 
There's many:a coat that is tattered and torn, 
Covers many a 
brave manly heart, 
But if he's not dressed like his neighboring self, 
Society keeps him apart. 
On one fortune smiles, while the other one fails, 
No matter what venture he tries, 
Till time in the end calls both to the grave, 
Then six feet of earth makes them both of one size. 
Now, should you ever meet a 
poor fellow that tries 
To battle this world and its frowns, 
You help him along, perchance he succeeds, 
Don't crush and still put him down. 
For a 
cup of cold water in charity given, 
Is remembered with joy in the skies, 
We are all human beings, we've all got to die, 
And six feet of earth makes us all of one size.

LITTLE DARLING. 
Words by H ARRY BurtNs. 
Music by P. R. BASLE. 
Am.—" Little Rosebud." 
All Rights Reerred. 
LITTLE darling, how I 
miss thee, 
How my heart doth ache with pain, 
How I 
love and long to kiss thee 
On thy rosy lips again, 
For my heart is wildly beating, 
And I 
1oni to call thee mine ; 
See the days are sadly fleeting, 
Let me worship at thy shrine, 
CHORUS. 
Little darling, sweet, I 
love you, 
With a 
love that's bright and clear, 
As those shining stars above you, 
I 
am truly yours sincere. (
Repeat Chorus.) 
With sweet kisses let me greet thee, 
Where the blooming roses grow, 
And like violets when you meet me, 
Let your cheeks with blushes glow. 
Happy thoughts around me hover. 
'Neath the sunshine of your smile, 
Call me not your truant lover, 
I'll be constant all the while, 
Little darling, sweet, etc. 
Still my thoughts are turning ever 
To those happy days gone by, 
And my eyelids faintly quiver 
As the tear drops from my eye. 
One sweet word now gently spoken 
Will my drooping spirit cheer, 
Give me but this little token, 
For ' twill ease the falling tear. 
Little darling, sweet, etc. 
Let me not from dreams awaken, 
Finding only grief and woe, 
Listen to the vows I've taken, 
To be true where'er I 
go. 
Let those shadows fade behind me, 
Let the sun no longer shine, 
Though sad tears may fall and blind me, 
Little darling you are mine. 
Little darling, sweet, etc. 
O'BRIEN'S GRAND SOIREE. 
COMIC SONG. 
By 3. P. 
SKELLY.

HARDING. 
All rights reserved. 
M IKE O'BRIEN was a 
politician, 
He always dressed in solid style, 
His ancestors they were patricians 
In the dear old Em'rald Isle. 
Last November he was elected 
For an alderman to be, 
Walhalla, Hall he then selected, 
And gave the boys a 
grand soiree. 
CHORUS. 
There was lots of fun for ev'ry one, 
The boys their legs did shake ; 
McGuinness sure, was on the flure, 
In waltzing, he " takes the cake." 
Their hoofs they slung, and songs they sung, 
The girls were gay and free. 
I 
danced all night till broad day-light, 
At O'Brien's grand soiree. 
Felix NcGluff and darling Daisy 
Were called upon to lead the dance; 
They showed such style it set them crazy, 
As round the room they did advance. 
Then the fun commenced in earnest, 
Hands all around,—all forward four, 
The room it got as hot as a 
furnace, 
While the dancers shook the floor. 
There was lots, etc. 
Pat O'Neil he did get excited 
When Malone made a 
little too free 
With the girl to whom he was plighted, 
And soon there was a 
great melee ; 
The crowd began to fight and scramble, 
The women all commenced to flee, 
They brought me home in several sections 
F,r9111 O'Brien's grand soiree. 
There was lots, etc. 
MY MARY ANN. 
Sung by LARRY TOOL= 
"
MY 
Mary Ann's a 
bruiser, 
I 
often try to lose her, 
She can not and won't be forced to die. 
She can paralyze a 
chicken, 
She is all the time a 
kicking— 
She's one of the girls that's always on the fly. 
Oh, she's gone on beef and mutton, 
She's a 
perfect glutton, 
t
-3he strikes terror to a 
Coney Island clam. 
She beat O'Leary walking, 
And Doctor Talmage talking— 
Such a 
constitution has my Mary Ann. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
greasy, 
She can kick the stuffing out of any man. 
She licked Tom Collins twice, 
I 
had to put her on ice— 
Such a 
constitution has my Mary Ann. \ 
My Mary Ann is a 
stunner, 
She is a 
perfect bummer, 
She weighs about two hundred and fifty pounds... 
She's all the time a 
mashing, 
Her clothes is out of fashion, 
Her equal in this city can't be found. 
Oh, you'll always find her lushing. 
You can smell her breath from Flushing, 
And the gang all say she isn't worth a 
hang. 
She used to go with Beecher, 
And she often tried to teach him 
To be a 
little tender on the lamb. 
She's a 
darling, etc.

GOOD-BYE, LOVELY LOU. 
Written and sung by Gus WILLIAMS, 
the greatest of all vocalists, 
with tremendous success. 
Copyright, 1879, by Louis P. GOULLIITD. 
'TWAS early in the month of May, 
I 
said to my girl Lou, 
As I 
am going far away, 
I'm going to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea ? 
She bowed her lovely head, 
Then placed her tiny hands in mine, 
And I 
to her then said--
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
She said, to you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought; 
Tho' I 
am told you sailors 
Have a 
wife in every port. 
I 
said, " Now, Lou, don't look so blue, 
Or think me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget 
The girl I 
left behind." 
Good-bye, etc. 
I've one thing, Lou, to tell to you, 
Before the seas I 
roam, 
And that is of the presents 
I'm going to bring you home. 
An Indian shawl, a 
parasol, 
A 
tiny kangaroo; 
A monkey and a 
parrot, yes, 
And they are all for you. 
Good-bye, etc. 
I 
bid adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted on the shore. 
And something seemed to tell me 
I 
should never see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned 
That she had gone away; 
So now as Lou has proved untrue, 
Why, I 
can only say— 
Good-bye, do.

II . 
LYNCH by Jam CONROY. 
1'5i a 
family man, and I'll tell you my woe— 
It will teach you a 
lesson wherever you go; 
Of every complaint I 
have sure had my share, 
I 
once lost all my teeth, and it fell out my hair ; 
I 
tried all the physic which druggists do sell ; 
But nothing I 
took that did make me feel well. 
'Twas a 
question of time my leaving this soil, 
Till to Lynch's I 
went for some cod liver oil. 
CHORUS. 
Oh Dr. J. Lynch—Oh ! Dr. J. Lynch— 
When sickness and pain my poor stomach did wrench, 
You saved me from taking my rest ' neath the soil, 
With your King of all physic—your cod liver oil ! 
To make matters worse, all my babies sick fell, 
My tom- cat stopped " mewing" and began then to swell, 
My serving man drank till he shook with the " jims I" 
And my wife one day made me the father of twins ! 
In fact all my household they went to the bad— 
No cure for their sickness at all could be had. 
For days thro' this town I 
did labor and toil 
Till to Lynch's I 
went for some cod liver oil. 
Oh! Dr. J. Lynch, etc. 
I 
met a 
young friend and said " where have you been ?" 
He said Fulton market ; the number eighteen ; 
There Dr. Lynch dwells, and he daily does toil, 
For he cures all New York with his cod liver oil ; 
His own manufacture, superior to all. 
In joy this I 
heard and soon made him a 
call. 
All my people got well and are still on the soiL 
More power to great Lynch and his cod liver oil! 
Oh ! Dr. J. Lynch, etc. 
Some doctors they give you powders and pills— 
Some say that a 
plaster will cure all your ills 
If hearty and hale thro' this world you would toil 
Be sure to get Lynch's pure cod liver oil ! 
Allow not the druggist bad physic to palm, 
Nor dose you with something that will do you harm. 
Just tell him at once it is Lynch's you mean, 
Keeps in Fulton market ; the number eighteen. 
Oh ! Dr. J. Lynch, etc.
