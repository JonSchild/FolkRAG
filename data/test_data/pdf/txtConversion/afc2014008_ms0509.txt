Folk Artists in Schools 1
 
Introduction 
In 1976 the Folk Arts Program began funding projects directed
 
at placing folk artists in school systems.
 These projects
 
reflect a variety of possibilities for enhancing educational
 
opportunities by inviting folk artists to the schools.
 Folk
 
artists are sometimes included in school residencies developed by
 
state agencies with NEA Artists in Education  (AIE)  funds,  but the
 
following document will assess only those Folk Artists in the
 
Schools  (FAIS)  programs that have been funded by the NEA Folk
 
Arts Program.
 
Grant descriptions extracted from summary cards which are
 
organized by federal fiscal years are reproduced on pages 3
 
through 33.
 A table on page 34 presents the number of grants
 
funded for each fiscal year.
 On pages 35 and 36 a breakdown of
 
states receiving FAIS grants is presented.
 
An explanation for the fluctuating number of grants funded
 
each year is beyond the scope of this report.
 This information
 
was originally expanded to include each fiscal year's total FAIS
 
grant amount,  average FAIS grant amount,  and the percentage of
 
the Folk Arts Program's annual budget expended on FAIS programs.
 
One look at the grant descriptions revealed the false image this
 
would present,  so it was eliminated.
 
FAIS programs are often only one phase of a multi-faceted
 
folk arts program receiving NEA Folk Arts funding.  Take for
 
example the Pueblo of Laguna Library's grant proposal which
 
received up to $15,500 for assembling a tape-recorded story
 
collection,  preparing a booklet of transcriptions and
 
translations,  and presenting live story-telling sessions in the
 
local schools.
 To discover exactly how much was allotted on the
 
story-telling sessions would require researching the final budget
 
reports.
 Proposals sometimes combine FAIS funding with state
 
folk arts coordinators positions,  community festivals,  or media
 
programs,  thus,  under present circumstances a complete analysis
 
of federal dollars expended on FAIS programs is impossible.
 
The use of summary cards as a basis for analyses produces an
 
additional problem which is shown by the following description.
 
FY 1980
 $20,000
 
Urban Gateways
 
Chicago,  Illinois
 
Support for folklorists's salary and travel,  field research

F
 
Folk Artists in Schools 2
 
This description makes no mention of FAIS program,  but one
 
component of the Urban Gateways Folk Arts Programs is their FAIS
 
residencies.
 FAIS programs included under the umbrella phrase
 
"folk arts programs" may have escaped this report.
 
FAIS coordinators developed teacher workshops,  lesson plans,
 
bibliographies,  discographies,  slide-tape presentations,  field
 
trips,  and more to complement the folk artists , workshops and
 
demonstrations.
 The possible combinations of all these
 
components has produced a variety of NEA supported FAIS programs.
