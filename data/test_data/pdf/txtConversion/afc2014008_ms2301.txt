Enclosed you will find four copies of the Termination Agreement that
 
Bessie should sign.  This has to be signed by me, by Bessie, and by the
 
publisher, so please have Bessie sign all four copies and return them
 
to me in the enclosed envelope.
 I will then send them off to the publisher
 
who will sign and return a copy to Bessie (
I will tell them to send it
 
in care of you two) and another copy to me.  What this will do is to return
 
the rights to the book to Bessie and me, so that we can then hope to interest
 
another publisher in printing it in paperback.  This would be nice for
 
everybody, because I
'think a great many people would buy it if it were
 
a little cheaper and available in paperback bookstores.
 
Along with this, I am sending four copies of the statement that I XAXX
 
read you over the telephone.  Bessie should sign all four where I
've
 
checked in green, and you should send me back three copies.  KEppxmx Keep
 
one for your and Bessie's records.  This paper will allow me to negotiate
 
with various publishers without having to send Bessie copies of all the
 
contracts we will  (
I hope) be considering.  You know that I will gry toget
 
the g very best deal possible for both of us and that Bessie will always
 
get half of any cash money that comes in.  This will just make my part of
 
the job a little easier.
 I will send Bessie a copy of the final contract
 
with my recommendation just as I did with Harper and Rowe. Please assure
 
her that I will do my best for her as I always have.
 
I hope all is going well for you.
 I understand the festival was very nice
 
this year (
as it always is, I believe).  Please keep track of the books that
 
I send; I have them stored at my daughter's place and John Bishop (
Naomi's
 
husband) is taking care of them for me.  So I owe him the postage when you
 
send it to me!  We do have plenty more when you need them, though.
 
Give Bessie a big hug for me, and tell her I love her and will send her a
 
pretty for Christmas.  With love to you both,

I also have received an informal

 I have just noticed that Mrs. Jones' name is mis-spelled in the Agreement
 
as "Jessie" rather than "Bessie".  I have made the correction and initialled it.
