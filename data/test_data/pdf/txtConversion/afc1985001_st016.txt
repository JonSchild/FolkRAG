Columbus Stockade Blues
COLUMBUS STOCKADE BLUES 4140 54B1
Mr. and Mrs. Rains Bakersfield, 1940
Way down in Columbus Georgia I wandered back to the sea Way down in Columbus
Stockade Friends, that's where my pretty went back on me.
Go and leave me if you wish to Never let me cross your mind In your heart you love
another Leave me down and I won't mind.
Many a night with you I've rambled Many an hour I've spent with you I thought I'd won your
heart forever And know'd you'd nave to follow mw.
Go and leave me if you wish to Never let me cross your mind In your heart you love
another Leave me down and I won't mind.
Last night while I lay sleeping I dreamed that I was in your arms When I awake I was
mistaken I was peeping through the bars.
Go and leave me if you wish to Never let me cross your mind In your heart you love
another Now I've got them walkin' blues.
