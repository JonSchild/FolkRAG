DANCING IN THE BARN. 
Music by TOMMY TURNER. 
Words by ANDY MCKEE. 
Oh, we'll meet at de ball in de evening, 
Kase I 
love to pass de time away, 
Wid Clemintina Consitina 
And my Angemima Mina May. 
Den we'll balance all to one another, 
Like de ship dat's going round de horn, 
Dar we'll meet you, yes we'll greet you, 
While dancing in the barn. 
CHORUS. 
As we move so gracefully, we're as happy as can be, 
Den swing your partners all together, 
Kase now's the time for you to learn, 
Music, singing, niggers singing and dancing in the barn. 
Den we's off to work in the morning, 
Singing as we go out to the field, 
Picking cotton, all else forgotten, 
Except to see how much de ground do yield. 
De black folks are happy while together, 
It's funny for to hear them tell a 
yarn, 
About a 
lover wid kisses smother, 
While dancing in the barn. 
F1S0sitt

As we move, etc. 
Sung with great success in Boston by ANDY McKEE. 
Oh the Yankees they have went and gone and done it, 
Down in Dixie they have taken all the gals and ran away, 
Oh, theyve raised the very dickens way down in that vicinity, 
And they gave the darkies all a 
holiday. 
But it's high times, good times, down in Ilassa's kitchen, 
The darkey gains his seven pounds a 
day, oh, 
Hilky biliky, tiny, a 
hind, Is going to be a 
general, 
At least so all the Yankee sog,ers say. 
But now de war is ended, and there's peace throughout thc 
country, 
But de nigger am no better than before, 
But when we have a 
jubilee we'll make your eye- balls jingle 
Kase soon we'll meet you on old raanan's shore. 
But it's high, etc. 
By ANDY MCKEE. 
Oh, we've just come down, 
To have a 
look around, 
For to see the sights 
And then we're homeward bound. 
For we're a 
happy pair, 
And I 
know you will declare, 
Another such a 
couple can't be found. 
While on the streets 
So many sights we see, 
And it seems so strange that people all agree 
That we really cut a 
dash 
When we're out upon the mash, 
And just the style to suit you to a 
T. 
CHORUS. 
My oh, me oh, don't we look so gay. 
Watch us or we'll throw ourselves away. 
Oh. how fondly. dear. I 
love you, 
You don't love in vain. 
You told me oft about my rival— 
Don't do that again. 
Now before we leave, 
And say to you good-bye, 
We hope and pray 
That you won't heave a 
sigh; 
For we'll return again. 
And on us you can depend. 
To make you laugh so much 
That you will cry. 
Next Sunday you will hear the marriage bell, 
Then unto you the secrets we will tell, 
We'll be no longer two, but stuck as tight as glue, 
Then we'll sing and dance till the day we We. 
Way down in old Virginia, 
The place where I 
was born, 
About 20 years ago, 
Early in de morn, 
Outside of Richmond, 
Straight toward the west, 
Where I 
used to work hard 
And never used to rest. 
Now I'm free, and I 
am so glad, 
Feel so goo(' that I 
can't feel sad, 
Now I'm free and I'm so glad, 
Dis am de sport that I 
always had. 
CHORUS. 
Ever since de time dat I 
was set free, 
I've been just as happy as happy can be. 
I 
never had a 
mother, I 
never had a 
dad, 
I 
never had a 
sister and a 
brother never had. 
Susie in de kitchen. 
Clara in de barn, 
Hattie mixing up dough 
Early in de morn. 
All do ole buck nigs 
At de cider press, 
Little nigs on de ground 
Spoiling of de dress. 
Way down in good old Georgia, 
The place where I 
was born, 
In that rosy, sunny country 
Where I 
used to hoe the corn. 
In childhood's happy moments 
With spirits light and gay, 
I 
long to see my birthplace, 
For I 
couldn't stay away. 
CHORUS. 
I'm travelling hack, I'm traveling back, 
I'm traveling night and day, oh. 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
I'm traveling all the way, 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, for 
I 
couldn't stay away. 
I 
once did love a 
fair one, 
Way down in Dixie's land. 
'Twas there I 
popped the question, 
I 
asked her heart and hand. 
She said her heart and hand were won, 
So from me she did stray, 
My heart is broke and so am I 
But I 
couldn't stay away. 
I'm traveling, etc. 
But since that time she tells me 
The other coon she's shook, 
The pen and ink she took in hand 
And scratched him from her book. 
My name she wrote upon the page, 
Which makes me feel so gay, 
If you won't grieve I'll take my leave 
For I 
Cannot stay away. 
Written and sung with immense success in all the leading 
variety theatres, by DAN SULLY, Irish Comedian.

poor hard workingman, 
I

'Tis very hard for me to clothe 
And feed my family : 
I've eleven children and a

And none but two are small, 
Now give me your attention. 
And FE teli you of them all,

And I'm the daddy of them all. 
There's Mickey, etc, 
Now Mickey he is thirteen, 
And Tommy is only nine, 
Both Jim and Tim are dancers, 
.And they have their business fine;

And Paul's a 
dandy barber, 
And the girls they sing and play. 
There's Mickey, etc. 
My daughters are the oldest 
Of all my family, 
Johanna she's twenty-four, 
And Rosanna is twenty-three;

They sing and play the livelong day, 
And at night they'll out and " mash." 
Written and composed by DAN SULLY, expressly for the MARAS, 
FRANK and CLARA. 
Sung by them with great success 
in their sketch, " Youth and Age." 
Oh ! here we are, my old husband ( wife) and I, 
And a 
jully old couple we are, 
We have lived together near sixty years, 
And have never known a 
family jar ; 
N,) 
children have we to dance on our knee, 
In our little cot down near the stream, 
And sorrow has never appeartr.'. a y 
To mar our life's sweet dream. 
Slowly we're travelling home, 
Slowly we're travelling home, 
And soon we will live in a 
happier place, 
For we're slowly travelling home. 
We are happy all day, and an unkind word 
Never as yet passed out lips, 
We are as happy together as two humming birds, 
Who the honey from each flower sips; 
We are in fact a 
model old pair, 
An example for both young and old, 
And you all will find that the saying is true— 
That love is far better than gold. 
Slowly, etc, 
By ANDY McKEE. 
Performed only by the licKEEs. 
A 
soldier bold you now behold, 
Our boys receive the cheers, 
We form a 
line and march in time. 
With the gallant fusileers; 
At the bugle call we must obey, 
And at command we march away, 
And the ladies say, here comes this way 
The gallant fusileers. 
And the ladies say, here comes this way 
The gallant fusileers. 
A 
soldier's life is a 
life for me, 
By the ladies we are admired you see, 
For we're the boys that fear no noise— 
The gallant fusileers; 
As we march, as a 
e 
march 
To the front without fright, it appears, 
Hip, hurrah! hip, hurrah! 
For the gallant and bold fusileers. 
CHORUS. 
As we march, march, march along, 
It's music to our ears, 
To hear them say, here comes this way 
The gallant fusileers. 
(Repeat.) 
As we march, as we march, 
As we march, march, march 
With the fusileers, 
The music's played while on parade, 
We handle the sword and gun, 
They all confessed we were the best, 
That we were number one; 
TO 
show to you what we can do, 
While with our drill we will go through, 
So just give your attention to 
The gallant fusileers. 
Should there by chance a 
war break out, 
With joy you'd hat' the soldiers shout, 
(hie volley will make the enemy skout, 
From the gallant fusileers. 
),)n't delay, let's away, 
Leave our wives and sweethearts in tears, 
Bless veil all, we won't fall. 
But return with the bold fusileers. 
As we march, etc.

OVER THE HILL ,ITEATH THE WILLOW 
• 
"43y H . 
T. 
H ARVV. 
Arranged by DAN SULLY. 
As sung with great success by EMMA DEZODA, ill character. 
Oh, once I 
was as gay and as happy, 
As any as you'd wish to see, 
I 
had a 
kind father and mother, 
And life was as bright as could be; 
But father has taken to drinking, 
And mother's been taken away, 
And now tor my bread I 
go begging, 
From the people I 
meet every day. 
CHORUS. 
I'm cold, I'm tired and hungry, 
From begging all day on the pave; 
Since over the lull ' neath the willow, 
My mother was laid in her grave. 
Each one I 
ask for a 
penny, 
Will look with contempt and with scorn, 
While tears in my eyes would be swelling, 
And I'd wish that Id never was born; 
Then a 
voice in my heart it would whisper, 
Try again and you will succeed, 
Then I'd gather up courage and try it, 
But not one my poor pleadings would heed. 
I'm cold, etc. 
But this cannot all last forever, 
Some day there must be an end, 
And then I'll be happy with mother, 
-With angels the good Lord will send; 
And then I 
will be so happy, 
When I 
am laid there to rest, 
I'll be happy with mother and angels, 
Then I'll be sheltered and blest, 
I'm cold, etc. 
Written by DAN SULLY. 
Music by '
FRANK BARLOW. 
As performed by FRANK OAKLEY, with staff solo. 
Oh ! here I 
am in front of the band, as you can plainly see, 
With my staff in hand I 
break the ladies' hearts, 
I'm captain, sergeant and lieutenant whenever I 
take command, 
While marching in front of the famous Donovan's band ; 
When I 
whirl my staff ' round in the air, I 
make the ladies stare, 
They would kiss me if they dare, they say ' don't he look nice 
there— 
Marching in front of the famous Donovan's Baud. 
CHORUS. 
When I 
give the signal to the leader for to play, 
I 
mark time, they keep step, and forward, forward march 
away; 
I 
put on my style, the ladies smile, because I 
look so grand, 
I 
feel so gay as I 
march away in front of the Donovan's Band. 
Oh! I 
am known throughout the land as the handsomest of men, 
The fellows all get jealous because I 
catch the girls. 
And when I 
march in front they say don't he look grand, 
Which makes all the fellows mad that belongs to Donovan's 
Band; 
They get so mad they cannot blow, all the people know, 
I 
am the ladies' beau, they praise my form where'er I 
go, 
While marching in front of the famous Donovan's Band. 
When I 
gire, etc. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT, the Rotterdam Comedian. 
There arc many curious titles 
For the ballads of the day, 
Such as " Kiss me once, dear mother," 
" 
Little Tommy's gone astray ;" 
But I've found some new and sparkling, 
Which I'll warble while I'm here, 
They are full of grief and pathos, 
And may draw a 
silent tear. 
CHORUS. 
Now prepare to hear my Carol, 
It will cause your hearts to throb; 
I 
will chirrup slowly, softly— 
Do not be ashamed to sob. 
Papa's chest-protector's faded, 
Throwing freckles at the breeze, 
Ile had seltzer on his ulster, 
Let me sniff the fragrant cheese; 
Little Willie's tombstone's mortgaged, 
Sister's gum is in the hash, 
lie had pimples on his duster, 
Let me hear the lightning flash. 
Now prepare, etc. 
There's a 
prize in every doughnut, 
Come and lean upon the ice, 
Do not waltz on liva's chignon, 
Throwing turkeys for the dice; 
Papa's hair is getting mouldy, 
When the dew is on the lake, 
Give my last year's clothes to brother, 
When I'm chilly let me shake. 
Now prepare, ete. 
Who has spit in auntie's slipper? 
Darling Kitty's hair's decayed, 
Let me hear that sweet hand-organ, 
Coaxing sunshine in the shade; 
When I'm bathing in the treetops, 
Sprinkling ginger on the sea, 
Papa, will you leave off boozing ? 
Save one little club for me. 
Now prepare, etc. 
Let me die among the oysters, 
There are scars upon his hair, 
Writing monograms in lager, 
Do not harm the grizzly bear; 
What is home without a 
doorknob ? 
When thy nose begins to blush, 
Soothing bedbugs in the moonlight, 
Bury me beneath the slush. 
Now prepare, etc.

Performed by the McKEF.s, in NNPY MrKEE's act of " Mischief." 
Travelling through this mighty nation, 
Had to stop at every station, 
The white folks used to call me out, 
To make me sing and dance; 
I'm a 
fourteen hundred dollar nigger, 
I 
know I'll never grow no bigger, 
I 
love to please de white folks, 
Whenever I 
gets de chance. 
Travelling through de cane and brushes. 
I 
never had no fights nor musses, 
Never cooked my oysters, 
'Kase I 
always likes dem raw; 
loves to hear de bells a-ringing, 
And de nigger wenches singing, 
James Girard Joralemon Johnson, 
Just from .,krItansaw. 
When I 
was a 
pickaninny, 
I 
eat so much it made me skinny, 
I 
used to hoe de corn by day, 
And hug de gals at night; 
Then I'd set old massa crazy, 
lie wooled me when I 
was lazy, 
Den I'd throw my feet so high, 
They'd go clean out of sight 
I 
never was a 
dandy nigger, 
I 
never tried to cut a 
figure, 
If I 
had too much to say, 
They'd make me hold my jaw; 
Then I'd dance till I 
was dizzy, 
Just to please my good old missy, 
James Girard Joralernon Johnson, 
Just from Arkansaw.

GOLDEN SHOWER. 
Written and composed by DAN SULLY. 
As sung with immense success by EMMA DEZODA. 
'Twits a 
pleasant morn in Spring, 
When the birds began to sing, 
And the flowers with their perfume filled the air; 
Carelessly I 
went along, 
Singing snatches from a 
song, 
When I 
espied a 
maid with a 
head of golden hair. 
She bestowed on nie a 
smile, 
Fascinating all the while, 
And in her hand she held a 
little flower; 
Which she pinned upon my breast, 
And you can guess the rest, 
And 
called her then my little golden shower. 
CHORUS. 
She's the angel of niy dreams, ( Sym.) 
Her eye so loving beams, 
(Sym.) 
Oh. my! she looked so gay, 
Like a 
little sunny ray, 
And I 
called her then my little golden shower. 
She said I 
will be thine, 
Then she put her hand in mine, 
And she softly laid her head upon my breast; 
I 
was in a 
whirl of bliss, 
When I 
asked her for a 
kiss, 
And her rosy lips to mine she shyly pressed. 
clasped her in my arms, 
And I 
gloried in her charms, 
Which put me in a 
heaven of delight; 
And now I 
am her beau, 
Arid in the little church below, 
We'll married ho just a 
week to-night. 
She's the angel, etc,

UNDER THE ARCH IN THE PARK. 
Dedicated to Miss JENNIE MORGAN. 
Words by W. E. MCNULTY. 
Music by GEO. VON KAMEKE. 
(Copyrighted.) 
Under the arch in the park, 
We were delightfully dreaming, 
Sweet was the song of the lark, 
Sunbeams around us are streaming ; 
He sat with his hand clasped in mine, 
My heart how I 
longed to unmask it, 
Glad to have said " It is thine." 
Had he the courage to ask it. 
CHORUS. 
Birds of the air, joyous and fair, 
Singing from dawn until dark ; 
1Vere you asleep, or did you just peep 
Under the arch in the park ? 
Under the arch in the park, 
Shadows around us were falling, 
Hushed was the song of the lark, 
Only the night-birds were calling; 
He whispered in tenderest strains. 
But his love, ah! he dared not reveal it, 
A kiss would have soothed all his pains— 
Bad he the courage to steal it. 
Birds of the air, etc. 
Under the arch in the park. 
Moonlight around us was shining, 
lie timidly made the remark: 
" 
Oh! for a 
heart I 
am pining, 
You might give me yours, love," he said, 
" 
I 
promise you never to break it." 
I 
blushed and I 
hung down my bead— 
Then he mustered up courage to take it, 
Birds of the air, etc.

DO YOU KNOW WHERE NOWHERE IS?

Written by W ALTER HOWARD, of Moore & Burgess' Minstrels, 
London, Eng.. 
Oh 1 
when the snow was on the ground, 
The twenty-two-th of June, 
The clock had just struck thirty-three, 
To A 
ards the afternoon; 
'Twas in a 
green and shady lane, 
Not far from Temple Bar. 
I 
saw a 
lady walking 
In an Irish jaunting ear. 
CHORUS. 
If you don't believe it, so do I, 
I'm going to nowhere bye and bye, 
Then I'll bring my witnesses, say, 
Do you know where nowhere is? 
I 
asked this gal to marry me, 
She smiled and answered no. 
So we were wed last 6unday week, 
Just seventeen years ago; 
The children gather 'round the fire, 
Each lovely Summer's day, 
And when the Winter time comes on, 
They all go making hay. 
If you don't, etc. 
She had an only sister once, 
That's living with her now, 
They never disagree, because 
They do so love a 
row; 
And when we rode out for a 
walk, 
She said she loved me so, 
That every time she squeezed my hand— 
She kissed my brother Joe. 
If you don't, etc.

Como again, sweet days of summer 
With your blue and cloudless skies, 
Bring to me a 
cherish'd maiden 
With her sweet and dreamy eyes; 
In the meadows and the valleys 
We will gaily trip once more, 
And exchange our loving kisses 
At the vine-clad cottage door.

Oh, my charming little sweetheart 
With the soft and dreamy eyes, 
Oh, I

Fairest maiden 'neath the skies. 
Come again my pretty songsters, 
Sing your glees for her and I, 
Call us to the shady forests 
Where you perch on twigs so high; 
Cheer us with your harmless twitter, 
Fill our hearts with new delight, 
Let the woodland ring with music, 
"Till you take your nests at night. 
Oh, my charming. &o. 
Come again, oh gentle breezes 
Scented with the new mown hay, 
Bring the flavor of the clover 
From the fields and pastures gay; 
Waft the echo of the mowers, 
Singing far across the lea. 
And remind nay little sweetheart 
' Sike must ever think of me. 
Oh, my charm,

LEANING ON A 
BALCONY, 
Music pubiished by E. Harding, 288 Bowery N. Y. 
'Tis pleasant on a 
summer night, 
I 
think you won't deny, 
When stars, like wicked laughing eyes, 
Are winking in the sky ; 
With some one by your side whose eyes 
Are bright as any star, 
To lean upon a 
balcony 
Enjoying your cigar. 
CHORUS. 
Leaning on a 
balcony, 
Smoking a 
cigar. 
Talking to a 
pretty girl, 
Heedless of her pa; 
Though some may like to strut about, 
I 
like it better far, 
Leaning on a 
balcony 
Smoking a 
cigar. 
You'rc glad to leave the crowded room 
And if the night be fair, 
To lean upon a 
balcony 
To get a 
breath of air; 
And if you've some one by your side, 
She won't take it amiss, 
If, in a 
quiet sort of way, 
You steal a 
little kiss. 
Leaning on a 
ba;cilo3-, etc. 
When curtains screen you from the room, 
And nobody can see, 
To pop the question quietly, 
What better place can be. 
The coldest- hearted must relent, 
You very soon will find, 
For girls upon a 
balcony 
have never proved unkind.

And they had no pie-nic when they toss'd the Turk.

Grandpa's chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate; 
Where he told his tales of boyhood, 
Kept the little ones awake. 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night, like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
So let the room be cheerful, 
Place the old arm chair 
Where we talked to Grandpa, 
With his silvery snow white hair. 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate. 
Gently sigh. we all must die, 
Like the fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked m 
the window, 
A 
careworn, hapless child; 
Then Grandpa whispered " baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin, he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, etc 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame; 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold and hungry, 
With Grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
prayer she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, etc 
DIMPLE IN HER CHIN,

No matter where we go, 
We often hear some funny talk, 
About some things you know. 
While walking down the street the other day, 
Looking neat as a 
bran new pin, 
When just ahead of me a 
girl I 
chanced to see, 
With a 
dimple in her chin.

stepped up to her side and raised my hat, 
She blushed and hung her head; 
My heart it kept going pit- a-pat, 
I 
scarce know what I 
said. 
I 
excused myself, but then I 
must not tell. 
For I

That I

MY DEAR LITTLE HOME.

THERE'S a 
little white cot that is dearer than life, 
Where I 
haste when the day's toil is o'er, 
Where I 
carry no thought of the world's eager strife, 
When I 
enter its low humble door. 
Oh! the smile of a 
fond loving wife there 
see, 
And I 
hear all the children's glad tone, 
This earth has no treasure more sweeter to me, 
Than the dear little home of my own.

I've a 
dear little home, yes a 
home of my own, 
I've a 
nice little home of my own, 
And no king is more proud as he sits on his throne; 
Than am I 
in my dear little home. 
*Oh! when eves I 
roam from this little white cot, 
In the hurry and noise of the day, 
My heart gladly turns to that heaven-like spot, 
And I 
long to its shelters to stray. 
And I 
long for the touch of a 
hand on my brow, 
For a 
dimpled one round my neck thrown, 
While the hours wanders by so wearisome now, 
Far away from my dear little home. 
I've a 
dear little home, &c. 
At the close of the day in the twilight so sweet, 
I 
wander again to the door, 
Where the loving ones over and over repeat, 
Their welcoming to me once more, 
As I 
sit by the fire with the children around, 
I 
think of the many that roam; 
No place for a 
shelter, no bed but the ground, 
No dear little home like my own. 
I've a, dear little home, &e.

LONE and weary through the streets we wander, 
For we have no place to lay our heads, 
Not a 
friend on earth is left to shelter us, 
For both our parents now are dead; 
Poor mother died when we were both young, 
Yet father made for us a 
home, 
But now he's killed by falling timbers, 
And we are left here all alone.

Who will pity us and who will give us shelter, 
Through this sad and lonely night, 
Little brother now is cold and Inngry, 
And the tears roll down his cheeks so white,

Then she would care for us to-night, 
But ah! the angels they have borne her, 
Unto a

And I 
thought that she loved me; 
She had coal- black eyes, her name was ' Lire,

But found it was no go, 
For she ran ofi with another fig, 
Called Alabama Joe.

often think about her, 
My heart is sad since she has gone away; 
But what's the use to grieve, for in that I 
don't believe,

One night I 
took her to a 
ball, 
And danced with all night, 
I 
paid her all attention, 
And done everything that's right, 
But when the ball was over, 
And the folks began to go, 
She left me standing like a 
stick, 
And away she went with Joe. 
But in spite, Ace. 
The last I 
heard of Lize, 
And her tar heel colored moke, 
She was doing washing, 
Her darling Joe was broke. 
So he has gone to blacking boots, 
To try to get along, 
She often wished she'd married me, 
For now she knows she's wrong.

In fact she takes the style right off them all. 
Oh! when I 
got acquainted I 
very nearly fainted, 
I 
thought she was a 
handsome feminine, 
Then up the street we started but very soon we parted, 
The boys all hollaed John, your going it blind. 
She's as, Six. 
Oh I 
then I-got disgusted my heart it almost bursted 
To think I 
had to leave this lady fair, 
She told me she was married I 
then no longer tarried, 
I 
left her on the instant at the square.

MUTTON SINGER,

A GAY young man your gazing on 
Which you can't help but say, sir, 
lie fell in love one afternoon, 
With a 
mutton singer gay, sir, 
She's fair, she's neat, she's beautiful, 
And she's as graceful as a 
mule, 
She came from College with McCool, 
This dashing mutton singer. 
Her feet are flat, one ear's bit oft 
She's a 
captivating dame, sir, 
She's crazy and gone oil to preach 
Along with Francis Train, sir, 
She's handsome as you may suppose, 
You'll kno - her by her broken nose, 
It sounds like thunder when it's blow' 
Oh ! where's my mutton singer. 
A 
flat boat ride's her chief delly,ht, 
While with another fellow 
Her coach and four is a 
mule and cart, 
Or a 
bursted umbrella. 
She colognes her hair with monkey grease. 
Until we're married I'll hare no peave, 
Won't some om, kil that homely beast, 
This euphoniou2 mutter stages.

OH two black aristocrats are we, 
And depend upon our style, 
To take us into high society, 
Of course we're thin, but that's no sill, 
As long as we are gay, 
Our parents tell us we were born 
In Southern Africa. 
Oh my brother Ike and I 
are bloods, 
At least the People say, 
And more than that the ladies' pet and joy, 
They say we're black but what of that, 
Each dog must have his day, 
Like us two black aristocrats 
from Southern Africa.

_Down in the meadow, by the brook, where first I

told her there that I'd be true " as the shining stars 
above." 
Oh ! she's so fair. I

The dearest girl and charmer, is Beautiful Caroline !

The dearest girl and charmer fair, 
And all the world beside, 
Is Caroline, this girl of mine— 
She soon will be my bride. 
We sat beneath a 
willow tree, to watch the running stream, 
She whispered tales of love to me, it seem'il as in a 
dream ; 
Oh ! the sweet birds sang there evening song, which echo'd 
through the vine--
Each hour seem'd a 
life long dream, with Beautiful Caro-

Come, dearest, let's be off for home, she whispered in my

SLAVERY DAYS. 
Words by E. HARRIGAN. 
Music by DAVE BRAH.LX. 
Music published by Wm. A. Po, N. Y. 
I 
am thinking to-day of dem years dat pass'd away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
hi old Virginny State, it was dar we separate, 
And it fill'd my heart with misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy, he was his mother's joy, 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise ; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, an' it broke de old man's heart, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
CHORUS. 
Dey never come again, let us give our praise to Him, 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, we will pray for dem dat's gone, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er, to dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; [bark, 
At night, when all was dark, we would hear de watch-dog 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, " You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd! 
For then we would weep and moan, for our souls were not 
our Own, 
In dein agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
I 
am very old and feeble, and our life am nearly done, 
I 
have traverd in the roughest kind of road ; [ last, 
Thro' sickness toil and sorrow, I 
have reach'd de end at 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de golden Scripture surely says ; 
But our mem'ry will turn roun, when our souls dey were 
tied down. 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days.

The cotton for to hoe,

She's sweeter than sweet potato vine, 
She wears such bright and golden tresses, 
I'm longing for the day when she'll be mine. 
One evening while with her promenading, 
The twinkling stars had just began to peep, 
The glorious light of day was lastly fading, 
All nature calm and hushed as in a 
sleep ; 
She took a 
seat beside a 
bunch of roses, 
I 
placed myself directly at her feet, 
While she admired the violets and posies, 
I 
whispered in her ear that she was sweet.

MESSAGE FROM THE POOR, 
Written by HARRY W OODSON. 
(Air—" Letter in the Candle.") 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 98 Nassau St., N. Y. 
There's a 
message from the many, 
From the many to the few, 
Toiling millions ask for justice 
From the rich, which is their due; 
Honest workers toiling, sighing, 
Crowning hearts as true as steel, 
Suffering, starving, groaning, dying, 
'Neath oppression's iron heel. 
CHORUS. 
Then give to the poor 
The hand of free good will, 
And help your struggling brother 
To climb life's rugged hill; 
Truth makes the man, 
And not his money bags, 
For crime oft stands in broadcloth, 
Whilst honesty's in rags. 
To the rich the poor are step-stones, 
Stepping stones to fortune's dower, 
Ever grinding down their wages, 
Up they mount to wealth and power; 
Oh, ye purse-proud sons of mammon, 
Whilst you o'er your riches gloat, 
Don't forget that honest people 
Often wear a 
ragged coat. 
Then give, etc.

The Cards are arranged in

arwers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but tue directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means or 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too difti. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-. 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved. 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

"en ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been *sent us, 
called HUMPTT DIIMPTY,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opposite, 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ape 
pearanee of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is ss 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting thr leaven 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit • the next only Columbine, thert 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles.

practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody
