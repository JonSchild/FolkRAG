Oh, She Licked Him and She Kicked HimOh, she licked him and she kicked him;She wouldn't let him
be.She welted him and she pelted him,Until he couldn't see.But McCarty wasn't hearty.Now she's got
a different party.She might have licked McCarty,But she can't lick me. OH, SHE LICKED HIM AND SHE
KICKED HIM.Oh, she licked him and she kicked him ; She wouldn't let him be . She welted him and
she pelted him , Until he couldn't see,But McCarty wasn't hearty.Now she's got a different party.She
might have licked McCarty , But she can't lick me.
