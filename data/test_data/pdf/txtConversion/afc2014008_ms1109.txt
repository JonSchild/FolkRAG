That's the bonus awaiting anyone

When conte mplating the cost of such

NEA Folk Arts Program
 
HONOLULU SITE VISIT REPORT
 
Robert Garfias
 
December 9-11,  1986
 
I arrived in Honolulu late in the morning of December 9th and was
 
met by Lynn Martin, Hawaii Folk Arts Coordinator.
 She briefed me
 
on the status of the apprenticeship program on the way into town.
 
The description  of the  masters selected  for the apprenticeship
 
program seemed  excellent and  certainly in keeping with the high
 
quality and  diversity of  the Traditional  Arts in  Hawaii.
 She
 
informed  me  that  she  had  arranged  for  me  to visit the two
 
apprentice programs in Oahu.
 
On reaching the State Cultural and  Historical Foundation office,
 
I met Sarah Richards and we went to lunch.
 I ant a little
 
hesitant to be completely sanguine about my meeting with her.
 I
 
say this because our meeting went extremely well with a deep
 
sense of agreement on all issues affecting the Foundation with
 
particular regard to the support of the Folk Arts.
 Yet my
 
conversations later that day with Council Chairman, Dr. Franklin
 
Odo and over the next two days with Lynn Martin led me to feel
 
that things were not quite as rosy as they first appeared.
 
Whether the sympathy for the Folk Arts program was only a facade,
 
a temporary readjustment due to direct pressure from the
 
Foundation staff and Council and the Governor, or a genuine
 
conversion,  it is difficult to say.
 I prefer to believe the
 
latter, not only because I much prefer to believe the best of my
 
fellow beings, but perhaps also because I sensed a strange bit of
 
the pragmatism which makes for survival.
 
My general position was to talk about the amazing richness and
 
diversity of Hawaii and how,  in my view this state represented a
 
real microcosm of what was America's great strength.
 I talked
 
about equity and outreach and what I saw to be clear and new
 
areas of focus from the National Endowment.
 I also stressed how
 
important it was to seek channels to expand away from the
 
mainstream traditions for their own survival in the face of clear
 
demographic changes all over the country.
 I also suggested that
 
I thought the Chairman, Frank Hodsell, would like to get a taste
 
of the cultural diversity of Hawaii during his visit.
 If the
 
Chairman does something to reinforce this interest with the
 
Executive Director and the Council during his visit, I believe
 
much good could be gained.
 Sarah Richards nodded agreement to
 
most of what I was saying which was reassuring but still I had
 
been expecting a little something of an honest and open
 
discussion on these issues.
 The reality I cannot assess with
 
confidence, but as I said, I would like to believe the best.
 
Things do change and sometimes even people seem to manage it.
 
That afternoon I went out 'Eva way' and up the hills to Aiea to
 
meet one of the apprentices, Rocky Kaiouliokahihikolo'ehu Jensen.
 
I had been told that there had been some pretty sharp words
 
between Rocky and the Council when they previously turned down
 
one of his requests.  He had submitted drawing work that was
 
derivative along with some traditional carving.  When I visited
 
his house I saw around his living room, much modern carving and
 
much that was excellent traditional Hawaiian carving.
 The
 
apprentice was a young Hawaiian who had been working with Rocky.
 
I talked to them about the opportunity which the Hawaii Cultural
 
and Historical Foundation support could provide them in allowing
 
them the chance to work on more traditional material which they
 
well knew how to do and thereby perhaps help them to create a
 
wider audience and broader appreciation for this work.
 The
 
quality of the work and its traditionality seems excellent.
 I
 
see no good reason why he should be penalized because he also
 
does more modern and marketable work as well.
 
On the Evening of the 9th I had dinner with Dr. Franklin Odo,
 
current Chairman of the State Arts Council.  He is a very
 
thoughtful and considerate person which I sensed even before I
 
met him and from our telephone conversations alone.
 I felt some
 
concern that he might not fully recognize the authority and
 
control which the Council had over the operation of the
 
Foundation staff.  As I talked with him it soon became clear that
 
he understood fully what his role was and was in fact already
 
exercising it.  Much had already happened.
 There had been almost
 
daily newspapers stories about the rifts between the Foundation
 
staff and the director.  At the point at which my visit occurred
 
the staff had an elected member of their own who was designated
 
to sit in on council meetings.
 There was, for some reason also a
 
legal observer from another state office.
 Franklin Odo informed
 
me that he had been directed by the Governor to be responsible
 
for a performance review of the Executive Director and she knew
 
that he was engaged in that process at the moment.
 
Things could not be clearer, or perhaps better.
 I expressed to
 
Franklin Odo my fear that, everything could go well while the
 
pressure is on, but then there is the fear that when things cool
 
down, there might be a return to the old patterns and then it
 
might be difficult to work up sufficient steam to get a counter
 
movement going again.
 There really should not be great undue
 
concern about this however, because things have been so bad in
 
the immediate past and the public knowledge of it already on
 
record along with the Governor's express concern that I do not
 
see much chance for things to fall apart again.
 
My overall impression of Franklin Odo was that he was a fine man
 
and an ideal person to heading the Council at this moment.
 His
 
ta 4 and diplomacy as well as the deeper strength should get them
 
through.
 He also has the clear confidence of the staff and they
 
regularly called him whenever anything went wrong at the
 
Foundation.
 He has told them now that he is Chair of the Council
 
that it is no longer ethical for them to do this, but my sense is
 
that they are quite assured by his presence on the Council.
 
The following morning, December 10,  it turned out I was free.
 I
 
am honestly not one of those who are quick to run to the beach,
 
although the New Otani Hotel, one of the best I have found yet in
 
Hawaii, particularly of that price, is right on the beach.
 I
 
called Betty Tatar and made a quick visit to the Bishop Museum.
 
In particular i had wanted to check out something that Rocky
 
Jensen, the carver had told me the day before, namely that the
 
Bishop was planning to set a live demonstrations of Hawaiian
 
crafts in a new complex.
 That was how he understood it.
 It
 
sounded like a great idea so I thought it might be a good idea to
 
see what it was about.
 
Betty gave me the complete tour of everything.
 i bought too many
 
books, met a great number of people on the staff and learned
 
much.
 They are also going thoUght a period of sharp transition.
 
They also have a live crafts show and demonstration going on
 
daily in the museum compound.
 The proposition which Rocky had
 
told me about was for a new Hawaiian Museum which is scheduled to
 
be opened and for which the funds have been proposed, but for
 
which there still needs to be a committee set up, etc., etc.
 It
 
is all quite far away.
 I did have an interesting discussion with
 
the associate director of them museum.
 I mentioned that at some
 
of the performances given in the museum complex, some of the
 
performers were not always carefully chosen as to authenticity or
 
quality.
 He explained that some of these performers were
 
volunteers and that it was difficult to turn them away.
 I told
 
him that I thought that as a public institution they ran the risk
 
of offending even larger numbers of people, entire groups in
 
fact, if they did not stand behind their reputation in everything
 
they presented.
 The Bishop is always a very exciting place to
 
visit.
 The younger members of the staff are quite impressive.
 
could spend a lot of time just hanging out there.
 
On the afternoon of the 10th, we again went out 'eva way', but
 
this time way out to the coast where we visited another
 
apprentice program recipient, Raymond Kane, a slack key
 
guitarist.
 This is some of the most beautiful stuff I have heard
 
here.
 The solo slack key style has a mellow gentleness to it
 
that is quite enthralling.
 The apprentice was a young high
 
school student who had formerly lived in the neighborhood, but
 
who now living somewhere in the middle of the island.
 The pair
 
made a perfect match and this looked like a clear case of the one
 
of the masters who without this program might have had no one
 
studying form him.
 Ray Kane is one of those few of the last
 
greats, like Sonny Chillingsworth, and Eddie Kamae.
 There is
 
another whose name I do not remember who lives on Hawai'j
 
although he is less well-known.
 Gaby Pahinui and Feets Rogers
 
are both dead sadly and it pains me that for two years the Folk
 
Arts panel turned down a Heritage Award for Eddie Kamae.  Maybe
 
we should set up a special award for those died before the panel
 
ever figured out who they were.
 I say this because I am still
 
irked by the fact that some of my colleagues on the panel were
 
muttering that they did not think Eddie Kamae belonged there at
 
all.
 That's absurd, particularly when they had already given
 
awards to Narciso Martinez, Lydia Mendoza and John Lee Hooker.
 
think it is just prejudice against what they think they know
 
about Hawaiian music.
 Everything is not Don Ho and "Tiny
 
Bubbles".
 There really is a Hawaiian folk music.
 Do you have
 
to get a Hawaiian on the panel to defend this?
 
Although it had nothing whatsoever to do with my assignment, on
 
the evening of the 10th I attended an Okinawan Classical music
 
rehearsal in Honolulu.
 The master was Nakasone Seisho, who also
 
teaches part time at the University of Hawaii.
 He is generally
 
acknowledged to be the best musicians around which  means, de
 
facto, the best in the US.
 There are many many more Okinawan
 
musicians and dancers in Hawaii than on the mainland and the
 
general level of quality is somewhat better.
 I had met Nakasone
 
some years before at the University of Hawaii, although I do not
 
think that he recalled.
 I was graciously welcomed to the group
 
and they were delighted to have a flute player join them.
 There
 
is another flute player on the island of Hawaii who is also a
 
Dancer and is the very young owner of famous biscuit factory
 
there.
 in any case the Oahu musicians do not often have the
 
opportunity of playing with a flute.
 We played one piece and Mr.
 
Nakasone asked if I could stay in Hawaii until the 21th when they
 
had a concert coming up.
 I told him that I had to get back.
 
They then decided to record their New Year's program right there
 
while they had a flute player.
 So we recorded about ten pieces.
 
He then told me that he was doing a concert in San Francisco in
 
May and wondered if I could join him there.
 
I thought it was significant that he taught three groups a week,
 
a beginner,  intermediate and advanced group.
 I was also told
 
that there were about six such clusters of groups in Honolulu.
 
When you add to this, I do not yet know how many Okinawan
 
Classical music groups on Hawai'i, the two I know of on Maui, One
 
on Lanai'i and one on Kawai'i it is indeed an impressive living
 
tradition.
 
On the morning of the 11th I, along with Roivalyn Tilghman, met
 
the Council.
 After everything I had previously heard I decided
 
to take a positive and reinforcing position with them.
 I said
 
that because they were appointed on the basis of the knowledge,
 
experience and prestige a state arts council could be compared
 
with a university board of regents, or even a supreme court.
 
They had the responsibility of interpreting how the State of
 
Hawaii would support and define the arts and that as a public
 
institution that was a responsibility to all the constituents in
 
state.
 I also shared my sense of sympathy with the difficulty
 
they faced in having to deal with the fact that everybody on the
 
mainland thought they already knew about Hawaii.
 I said,
 
however, that I did not think they should let that force them
 
into a role of overcompensating in their attempt to be like the
 
mainstream institutions on the mainland.
 Let KODAK do a Hula
 
A
 
I
 
show at Waikiki, but that they should highlight and support what
 
they knew to be the best of the State.
 I talked for quite a bit
 
and touched on a great number of things, but in essence I tried
 
to be supportive while at the same time telling them that I
 
thought the message coining from Washington had clear implications
 
of outreach and diversity built into them and that I thought the
 
chairman would like to see the best of what they were doing in
 
this regard while on his visit.
 
After my meeting with the Council, I left with Bernie Lopez and
 
we talked for a couple of hours on a great range to this; NEA,
 
the National Council, CPAC, the arts in the State of Hawaii and
 
the Hawaii Council.
 He seems to be doing well and enjoying the
 
life in Hawaii.
 It was the first time we had the opportunity to
 
talk at any length and I found it very enlightening.

I would like to share with you a few of my own views on the
 
context of the Arts in Hawaii,  with a particular view to your
 
coming visit there.
 I have attached a copy of the site visit
 
report I completed after my visit there last December.
 I also
 
had a few words with Fraser Barron and he asked that I share with
 
you some ideas which you might use in talking to people on the
 
arts in Hawaii and from the national point of view.
 
To me,  the most important and marvelous thing about Hawaii is
 
that it represents what I believe to be the essence of the best
 
of which this country strives to be.
 Not the old "melting pot"
 
idea,  which I never did believe was true of us,  but rather a
 
group of peoples from widely different cultural backgrounds,
 
coming together,  sharing new common goals,  learning from each
 
other,  and yet managing to retain the best and most important
 
elements of their own traditions.
 The cultural diversity of
 
Hawaiian Islands surpasses that of New York or California and
 
thus is greater than that of any state in the union.
 Besides
 
sizeable groups of every Pacific island group,  there are vast
 
numbers of Filipinos,  Chinese,  Japanese,  Koreans and Okinawans.
 
These have been recently augmented by Thai,  Vietnamese and
 
Cambodians.
 In addition,  there are very important and vital
 
enclaves of Portuguese,  Puerto Ricans,  and Mexicans,  now referred
 
to as "Paniolos".
 
Although this is something of a digression,  a point you need to
 
bear in mind is,  I believe,  the fact that while tourism is a
 
positive economic fact of life in the state,  it is regarded as a
 
negative cultural factor by the locals.
 This has resulted in an
 
almost defensive attitude among Hawaiian Arts advocates.
 They
 
want to feel that they are every bit as good and elitist as the
 
best of their mainland counterparts and will,  therefore,  want to
 
show off their symphony,  opera and art museum.
 They are also,
 
I believe,  both proud -
 and a little insecure about this pride - 
in the native Hawaiian Arts.
 I believe that pride in the

native Hawaiian traditions needs to be reinforced,  but in
 
addition the art world in Hawaii in general and State Arts
 
Council specifically,  needs to be encouraged to recognize that
 
all these other Asian and European non-anglo traditions are now
 
also Hawaiian and are in need of recognition and encouragement.
 
Back to the main points.
 I think that as the US looks more and
 
more to Asia as a point of international focus for technology,
 
economics and culture,  Hawaii becomes a vitally important
 
interface between all of the cultures and peoples of the Pacific.
 
Somehow this cultural mediator role along with the stepping stone
 
to Asia position,  could well be worked into what you might want
 
to say after expressing some note of understanding and sympathy
 
to those old Hawaii hands who in their hearts would like to make
 
Hawaii like New York City.
 
The native Hawaiian and other traditions really do need
 
encouragement there and even an expression of interest from you
 
could do much good and might help to ease the insecurity about
 
such things on the part of the State Arts Council.
 It would be
 
very good if you had a chance to talk to them.
 Sarah Richards
 
has kept them in a dark corner and told them that the Endowment
 
people do not wish to hear from them directly but only through
 
her.
 A meeting with the Council may be difficult to arrange.
 I
 
do strongly urge that you have a private chat with Dr.  Franklin
 
Odo,  current Chair of the State Arts Council.
 You will find him
 
an engagingly sincere and honest young man.
 The current governor
 
has asked him to conduct a performance review of Sarah Richards.
 
He is the perfect person to do so and to remain fair to all
 
parties.
 Sarah Richards,  not a bad sort at all mind you,  will,  I
 
suspect,  try to show you a Hawaii that looks much like Orange
 
County on the surface.
 You can smile but don't believe it until
 
you have had a chance to speak with Franklin Odo.
 
I know that you have talked with Ronialyn already and I would be
 
very surprised if our perceptions on Hawaii were very different.
 
I know you will enjoy your visit.
 
Sincerely,
 
Robert Garfias

HONOLULU SITE VISIT REPORT
 
Robert Garfias
 
December 9-11,  1986
 
I arrived in Honolulu late in the morning of December 9th and was
 
met by Lynn Martin,  Hawaii Folk Arts Coordinator.
 She briefed me
 
on the status of the apprenticeship program on the way into town.
 
The description of the masters selected for the apprenticeship
 
program seemed excellent and certainly in keeping with the high
 
quality and diversity of the Traditional Arts in Hawaii.
 She
 
informed me that she had arranged for me to visit the two
 
apprentice programs in Oahu.
 
On reaching the State Cultural and Historical Foundation office,
 
I met Sarah Richards and we went to lunch.
 I am a little
 
hesitant to be completely sanguine about my meeting with her.
 I
 
say this because our meeting went extremely well with a deep
 
sense of agreement on all issues affecting the Foundation with
 
particular regard to the support of the Folk Arts.
 Yet my
 
conversations later that day with Council Chairman,  Dr.  Franklin
 
Odo and over the next two days with Lynn Martin led me to feel
 
that things were not quite as rosy as they first appeared.
 
Whether the sympathy for the Folk Arts program was only a facade,
 
a temporary readjustment due to direct pressure from the
 
Foundation staff and Council and the Governor,  or a genuine
 
conversion,  it is difficult to say.
 I prefer to believe the
 
latter,  not only because I much prefer to believe the best of my
 
fellow beings,  but perhaps also because I sensed a strange bit of
 
the pragmatism which makes for survival.
 
My general position was to talk about the amazing richness and
 
diversity of Hawaii and how,  in my view this state represented a
 
real microcosm of what was America's great strength.
 I talked
 
about
 equity and outreach and what I saw to be clear and new
 
areas of focus from the National Endowment.
 I also stressed how
 
important it was to seek channels to expand away from the
 
mainstream traditions for their own survival in the face of clear
 
demographic changes all over the country.
 I also suggested that
 
I thought the Chairman,  Frank Hodsell,  would like to get a taste
 
of the cultural diversity of Hawaii during his visit.
 If the
 
Chairman does something to reinforce this interest with the
 
Executive Director and the Council during his visit,  I believe
 
much good could be gained.
 Sarah Richards nodded agreement to
 
most of what I was saying which was reassuring but still I had
 
been expecting a little something of an honest and open
 
discussion on these issues.
 The reality I cannot assess with
 
confidence,  but as I said,  I would like to believe the best.
 
Things do change and sometimes even people seem to manage it.
 
That afternoon I went out  'Eva way'  and up the hills to Aiea to
 
meet one of the apprentices, Rocky Kaiouliokahihikolo'ehu Jensen.
 
I had been told that there had been some pretty sharp words
 
between Rocky and the Council when they previously turned down
 
one of his requests.
 He had submitted drawing work that was
 
derivative along with some traditional carving.
 When I visited
 
his house I saw around his living room, much modern carving and
 
much that was excellent traditional Hawaiian carving.
 The
 
apprentice was a young Hawaiian who had been working with Rocky.
 
I talked to them about the opportunity which the Hawaii Cultural
 
and Historical Foundation support could provide them in allowing
 
them the chance to work on more traditional material which they
 
well knew how to do and thereby perhaps help them to create a
 
wider audience and broader appreciation for this work.
 The
 
quality of the work and its traditionality seems excellent.
 I
 
see no good reason why he should be penalized because he also
 
does more modern and marketable work as well.
 
On the Evening of the 9th I had dinner with Dr.  Franklin Odo,
 
current Chairman of the State Arts Council.
 He is a very
 
thoughtful and considerate person which I sensed even before I
 
met him and from our telephone conversations alone.
 I felt some
 
concern that he might not fully recognize the authority and
 
control which the Council had over the operation of the
 
Foundation staff.
 As I talked with him it soon became clear that
 
he understood fully what his role was and was in fact already
 
exercising it.
 Much had already happened.
 There had been almost
 
daily newspapers stories about the rifts between the Foundation
 
staff and the director.
 At the point at which my visit occurred
 
the staff had an elected member of their own who was designated
 
to sit in on council meetings.
 There was,  for some reason also a
 
legal observer from another state office.
 Franklin Odo informed
 
me that he had been directed by the Governor to be responsible
 
for a performance review of the Executive Director and she knew
 
that he was engaged in that process at the moment.
 
Things could not be clearer,  or perhaps better.
 I expressed to
 
Franklin Odo my fear that,  everything could go well while the
 
pressure is on, but then there is the fear that when things cool
 
down,  there might be a return to the old patterns and then it
 
might be difficult to work up sufficient steam to get a counter
 
movement going again.
 There really should not be great undue
 
concern about this however, because things have been so bad in
 
the immediate past and the public knowledge of it already on
 
record along with the Governor's express concern that I do not
 
see much chance for things to fall apart again.
 
My overall impression of Franklin Odo was that he was a fine man
 
and an ideal person to heading the Council at this moment.
 His
 
tack and diplomacy as well as the deeper strength should get them
 
through.
 He also has the clear confidence of the staff and they
 
regularly called him whenever anything went wrong at the
 
Foundation.
 He has told them now that he is Chair of the Council
 
that it is no longer ethical for them to do this, but my sense is
 
that they are quite assured by his presence on the Council.
 
The following morning,  December 10,  it turned out I was free.
 
am honestly not one of those who are quick to run to the beach,
 
although the New Otani Hotel,  one of the best I have found yet in 
Hawaii, particularly of th at price,  is right on the beach.
 I
 
called Betty Tatar and made a quick visit to the Bishop Museum.
 
In particular I had wanted to check out something that Rocky
 
Jensen,  the carver had told me the day before, namely that the
 
Bishop was planning to set a live demonstrations of Hawaiian
 
crafts in a new complex.
 That was how he understood it.
 It
 
sounded like a great idea so I thought it might be a good idea to
 
see what it was about.
 
Betty gave me the complete tour of everything.
 I bought too many
 
books, met a great number of people on the staff and learned
 
much.
 They are also going thought a period of sharp transition.
 
They also have a live crafts show and demonstration going on
 
daily in the museum compound.
 The proposition which Rocky had
 
told me about was for a new Hawaiian Museum which is scheduled to
 
be opened and for which the funds have been proposed, but for
 
which there still needs to be a committee set up,  etc.,  etc.
 It
 
is all quite far away.
 I did have an interesting discussion with
 
the associate director of them museum.
 I mentioned that at some
 
of the performances given in the museum complex,  some of the
 
performers were not always carefully chosen as to authenticity or
 
quality.
 He explained that some of these performers were
 
volunteers and that it was difficult to turn them away.
 I told
 
him that I thought that as a public institution they ran the risk
 
of offending even larger numbers of people,  entire groups in
 
fact,  if they did not stand behind their reputation in everything
 
they presented.
 The Bishop is always a very exciting place to
 
visit.
 The younger members of the staff are quite impressive.
 
could spend a lot of time just hanging out there.
 
On the afternoon of the 10th, we again went out  'eva way', but
 
this time way out to the coast where we visited another
 
apprentice program recipient, Raymond Kane,  a slack key
 
guitarist.
 This is some of the most beautiful stuff I have heard
 
here.
 The solo slack key style has a mellow gentleness to it
 
that is quite enthralling.
 The apprentice was a young high
 
school student who had formerly lived in the neighborhood, but
 
who now living somewhere in the middle of the island.
 The pair
 
made a perfect match and this looked like a clear case of the one
 
of the masters who without this program might have had no one
 
studying form him.
 Ray Kane is one of those few of the last
 
greats,  like Sonny Chillingsworth,  and Eddie Kamae.
 There is
 
another whose name I do not remember who lives on Hawai'i
 
although he is less well-known.
 Gaby Pahinui  and Feet-
, Rogers
 
are both dead sadly and it pains me that for two years the Folk
 
Arts panel turned down a Heritage Award for Eddie Kamae.
 Maybe
 
we should set up a special award for those died before the panel
 
ever figured out who they were.
 I say this because I am still
 
irked by the fact that some of my colleagues on the panel were
 
muttering that they did not think Eddie Kamae belonged there at
 
all.
 That's absurd,  particularly when they had already given
 
awards to Narciso Martinez,  Lydia Mendoza and John Lee Hooker.
 
think it is just prejudice against what they think they know
 
about Hawaiian music.
 Everything is not Don Ho and "Tiny
 
Bubbles".
 There really is a Hawaiian folk music.
 Do you have
 
to get a Hawaiian on the panel to defend this?
 
Although it had nothing whatsoever to do with my assignment,  on
 
the evening of the 10th I attended an Okinawan Classical music
 
rehearsal in Honolulu.
 The master was Nakasone Seisho,  who also
 
teaches part time at the University of Hawaii.
 He is generally
 
acknowledged to be the best musicians around which  means,  de
 
facto,  the best in the US.
 There are many many more Okinawan
 
musicians and dancers in Hawaii than on the mainland and the
 
general level of quality is somewhat better.
 I had met Nakasone
 
some years before at the University of Hawaii,  although I do not
 
think that he recalled.
 I was graciously welcomed to the group
 
and they were delighted to have a flute player join them.
 There
 
is another flute player on the island of Hawaii who is also a
 
Dancer and is the very young owner of famous biscuit factory
 
there,
 in any case the Oahu musicians do not often have the
 
opportunity of playing with a flute.
 We played one piece and Mr.
 
Nakasone asked if I could stay in Hawaii until the 21th when they
 
had a concert coming up.
 I told him that I had to get back.
 
They then decided to record their New Year's program right there
 
while they had a flute player.
 So we recorded about ten pieces.
 
He then told me that he was doing a concert in San Francisco in
 
May and wondered if I could join him there.
 
I thought it was significant that he taught three groups a week,
 
a beginner,  intermediate and advanced group.
 I was also told
 
that there were about six such clusters of groups in Honolulu.
 
When you add to this,  I do not yet know how many Okinawan
 
Classical music groups on Hawai'i,  the two I know of on Maui,  One
 
on Lanai'i and one on Kawai'i it is indeed an impressive living
 
tradition.
 
On the morning of the 11th I,  along with Romalyn Tilghman,  met
 
the Council.
 After everything I had previously heard I decided
 
to take a positive and reinforcing position with them.
 I said
 
that because they were appointed on the basis of the knowledge,
 
experience and prestige a state arts council could be compared
 
with a university board of regents,  or even a supreme court.
 
They had the responsibility of interpreting how the State of
 
Hawaii would support and define the arts and that as a public
 
institution that was a responsibility to all the constituents in
 
state.
 I also shared my sense of sympathy with the difficulty
 
they faced in having to deal with the fact that everybody on the
 
mainland thought they already knew about Hawaii.
 I said,
 
however,  that I did not think they should let that force them
 
into a role of overcompensating in their attempt to be like the
 
mainstream institutions on the mainland.
 Let KODAK do a Hula
 
show at Waikiki,  but that they should highlight and support what
 
they knew to be the best of the State.
 I talked for quite a bit
 
and touched on a great number of things,  but in essence I tried
 
to be supportive while at the same time telling them that I
 
thought the message coming from Washington had clear implications
 
of outreach and diversity built into them and that I thought the
 
chairman would like to see the best of what they were doing in
 
this regard while on his visit.
 
After my meeting with the Council,  I left with Bernie Lopez and
 
we talked for a couple of hours on a great range to this;  NEA,
 
the National Council,  CPAC,  the arts in the State of Hawaii and
 
the Hawaii Council.
 He seems to be doing well and enjoying the
 
life in Hawaii.
 It was the first time we had the opportunity to
 
talk at any length and I found it very enlightening.

BEFORE CHILDREN HAD TEETH, THE MOTHERS CHEWED
 
THE BUDS AND GAVE THE CHEWED MATERIAL TO THE
 
CHILDREN TO SWALLOW,
 
BUDS OF THE H

COUSIN OF THIS PLANT FROM WET SPOTS I
N THE
 
FOREST TO USE FOR MEDICINE,
 N

THE WEED BECAUSE IT I
S EASIER TO GET.
 
THE ANCIENT HAWAIIANS USED THE LEAVES OF THE
 
L

CHEWED BY THE MOTHER BEEORE SHE GAVE THEM TO
 
THE CHILD TO SWALLOW.
 I

) FOR A LARGE BOIL, 2
 GREEN LEAVES WERE
 
RUBBED TOGETHER WITH SOME SALT UNTIL THEY
 
WERE SOFT.
 THEN THIS WAS PUT ON TOP OF THE
 
BOIL TO COVER THE WHOLE LUMP,
 A
 NARROW P

THE POLYNESIANS FOUND MANY K
INDS OF L
1MU  WHEN
 
THEY ARRIVED HERE -
-
 BOTH IN THE SALT WATER OF
 
THE OCEAN, AND I
N THE FRESH WATER OF STREAMS
 
AND PONDS,
 W

ICTURE ONLY OF
 
THE ONE THEY CALL L
IMU-KALA.
 SOMETIMES I
T I
S
 
CALLED HOLLY  L
IMU BECAUSE ITS LEAVES �OOK L
IKE
 
OLLY LEAVES, WITH I
TS SPINY EDGES,
 T I
S
 
VERY COMMON.
 ALTHOUGH THE HAWAIIANS USED THE
 
REAL YOUNG LEAVES FOR FOOD (
OLDER LEAVES ARE
 
TOO TOUGH AND SPINY), THEY ALSO USED THIS L
IMU,
 
AND MANY OTHERS,  FOR MEDICINE.

ANOTHER INTERESTING USE FOR THIS  L

DONE IN THIS WAY:
 A PATIENT WHO WAS RECOVER-

NOWADAYS), AND WALK SLOWLY I
NTO THE OCEAN
 
WHERE THERE WERE WAVES, BUT ONES THAT WEREN'T
 
TOO STRONG.
 A

THE POLYNESIANS WHO CAME TO SETTLE I
N HAWAII
 
BROUGHT BANANAS WITH THEM.
 ALTHOUGH WE THINK
 
OF THE BANANA TREE ESPECIALLY AS A FOOD PLANT,
 
THE HA AIIANS USED THE BANANA FOR A MEDICINE,
 
TOO.
 I
HEY USED D
IFFERENT K
INDS FOR D
IFFERENT
 
D
ISEASES,
 
THE JUICE OR SAP FROM THE CUT FLOWER BUD WAS
 
USED WHEN A PERSON HAD A WEAKNESS OF THE BODY
 
ND A COATED TONGUE FROM STOMACH TROUBLE,
 
I
HE FLOWER BUD WAS ALSO POUNDED WITH OTHER
 
THINGS, AND THE JUICE SQUEEZED OUT AND
 
STRAINED.
 THIS L
IQUID HELPED GET R

STOMACH CRAMPS.
 
BOILED R
IPE BANANA FRUITS WERE MASHED AND
 
ADDED TO OTHER GROUND -UP PLANTS -

 THEN M
IXED
 
W
ITH WATER AND F
INALLY STRAINED.
 THIS L
IQUID
 
WAS USED FOR CONSTIPATION,
 
THE R
IPE FRUIT WAS ALSO USED FOR ASTHMA.
 
WHEN A BABY WAS WEAKLY, THE MOTHER P
INCHED
 
OFF THE TIP OF THE FLOWER BUD AND GAVE THE
 
DROPS OF SAP OR JUICE THAT DRIPPED OUT TO
 
THE BABY.

THE POLYNESIANS FOUND THIS PLANT GROWING HERE
 
WHEN THEY CAME TO HAWAII,
 THEY USED IT BOTH
 
FOR MAKING DYES FOR THEIR TAPAS, AND FOR
 
MEDICINE.
 BOTH THE FLOWERS AND BARK WERE
 
USED.
