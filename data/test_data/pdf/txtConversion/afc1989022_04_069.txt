NEVADA DAY 
Went with Andrea Graham to Carson City for celebration of 
Nevada's entry into union in 1864. 
Went specifically to talk 
with and photograph Louis Gibellini at the sinqle-jack driljing 
contest; billed as the "World's Championship.." 
Competitors come 
from all over the west, primarily Colorado, Nevada and Idaho, 
with an occasional Californian or two. 
Men and women compete. 
Men use a four pound hammer (no more than five pounds), women a 
three pounder. 
The hammer_is_sometimes_called —"single-jack" in 
the vernacular, hence the name of the contest. 
Drillers work for 
ten minutes,
-the hole is measured, and the person with the 
deepest hole wins. 
Two people make a team; the driller and a 
person who directs a trickle of water into the hole for 
lubrication and to keep the dust down. 
Each driller uses up to 
twelve "steels" including one (or two sometimes) starters for 
"collering" the hole. 
It is important to get the hole started 
round, not "three-cornered" because if the hole is three-cornered 
the steels will not turn easily and likely get jammed. 
There is a distinction between the Nevada and the Colorado 
style of single-jack drilling. 
The Coloradans lift the hammer 
high over their head, resulting in a stronger strike, but fewer 
strikes per minute. 
The Nevadans seldom raise the hammer over 
their head, but get up to 80 or so strikes per minute. 
Each 
adherent has his or her own reasons for believing theirs to be 
the best method. 
ouis Gibellini is 82 years old, still competes (though not 
seriously; as he says, they invite him because he's an old-timer 
who can still do it), and actually beats a few of the college 
aged guys. 
He says very few of the current crop of competitors 
know anything much about real hard-rock mining, especially doing 
it the old way, but that several either go to or went to college 
to study mining technology. 
Most of the younger competitors are 
in their twenties, very stout, often look like they train with 
weights, and take their drilling seriously. 
Louis is short and 
thin, used to train on a stone outside his house in Eureka, but 
no longer does. 
When he drill, he never falters or loses his 
grip. 
The bicep on his right arm is amazing; looks like a tennis 
IAW-BO-F103189 -

ball! 
Took a bunch of photos (B&W & color) of Louis before and 
during the drilling; none particularly good offer seeing them. 
Made appointment to visit him in Eureka the next weekend. 
The whole tradition of single-jack (and earlier double-jack, 
and current pneumatic) drilling contests is fascinating. 
Archie 
Green wrote an article on the term "jack" with particular 
reference to its use as an activity; ie: single-jack, etc, and 
published it in Western Folklore a few years back. 
Try to 
remember to get reference. 
At any rate, the tradition goes back 
at least to the 1870s, perhaps earlier, but neither I nor Archie 
has uncovered any written reference to earlier contests. 
They 
are certainly on a par with chain sawing contests, rodeo, tests 
of flying skills, axe throwing, etc. 
But is very regional in 
history and character; western hard-rock drilling technology and 
language is very different in many key ways from eastern coal 
mining. 
More needs to be done with this, historically and as a 
current folk event.

EUREKA 
Arrived in Eureka by air from Tuscarora, NV around S:OOpm. 
Had dinner at the Owl Club with Andrea (rib eye steak was good). 
Went to Louie's Lounge "where the fun is." 
Louie's is owned by 
Louis Gibellini (see F103189 notes). 
Had a couple of beers, 
chatted with the folks there, including the bar tender, Grace, 
who said Louis was "upstairs." 
When she left, another bartender 
(male, don't know name) came in, tried to buzz Louis on the 
intercom, but no luck. 
Talked with bar patrons about mining in 
the area, including new process of breeding micro-organisms that 
"eat dirt, shit gold." 
If this works, it may do away with 
cyanide leaching; hope it works. 
Town pretty slow; none of the bars or restaurants were busy; 
few people on street.

EUREKA 
Visited Louis Gibellini with Andrea Graham at his home above 
his bar, Louie's. Tape recorded 1 1/2 hours (IAW-BO-A001-002). 
Talked about single-jack drilling, his family, rock buildings in 
town, etc. 
His father and mother came to Nevada from 
Switzerland. 
Father ran a pack mule outfit; don't know whether 
he owned it or-just worked for someone else. 
Did not burn 
charcoal. 
Details on tape, which see. 
Took lots of photos of 
Andrea interviewing him in his living room; some OK. 
Examined 
his shop where he sharpens his drilling steels,  
and dnPs__ 
o t
her 
bla 
ksmithi-ng-work -.—
He 
—,IaAr-_ens "the old time way--like they- did 
a hundred years ago." 
Talks alot about 
a new --way-, --they use 
"science" today, and although his steels work just fine for work, 
they can't compete in the contests. 
As he says, "I don't have 
any science." 
Took a few shots of his steels, jack _(hammer) and 
water bucket on the _s_tone he practices on; top full of  holes he's 
drilled ovre 
the years. 
Left Louis' around 1:OOpm and headed to Fish Creek to see 
where Italian "carbonar-ill wos],e_l  in the late 19th century kma

 g 
charcoal for the  smelters. 
Lead and silver  were mined in Eureka. 
Drove miles on rough, dusty roads before finally finding the 
area. 
Several charcoal "pits" are still evident with bits of 
charcoal scattered about. 
Stone walls and one very small oven 
(used for charcoal or baking??) easily seen. 
Few photos. 
Returned to Eureka around dark. 
Supper at Eureka Cafe -- Chinese. 
Met (re-met) Connie Hicks 
at supper with her son and other friends. 
She lives in Elko now, 
but raised in Eureka. 
Told us we had to visit Albert Biale, as 
did Louis Gibellini. 
Made appointment to see the Mason Hall; the 
only hall in the US that is underground." 
This building was 
formerly the IOOF (Odd Fellows) Hall. 
There are  sevPral historic 
photos, both in the Eureka courthouse and Nevada Historical 
Society 
 in RenQ, that show people in their IOOF regalia in the 
hall. 
Still very much the same as late 19th century. 
Done a 
good job of keeping it more or less as it was.

GRAVEYARDS 
Sunday. 
Went to Catholic cemetery with AG; took lots of 
photos, including one roll of 1000 ASA color shot at 100 ASA, and 
one roll of 200 ASA shot at 100. 
The 200 film was OK by pulling 
the developing a little, but even when pulling the 1000, didn't 
work. 
Need to re-shoot a few things, especially the Gibellini, 
Damele, Biale and other stones and decorative elements. 
Several 
graves have metal flower wreaths on them, and one has 2 beaded 
wreaths; one black, the other white. 
There are five graveyards 
in Eureka; City, County, IOOF, Catholic and Masons. 
Several 
stones in Catholic were written in Italian, giving place of birth 
in the old country. 
Others in English did the same. 
Seems like 
there were more "native of Ireland" stones than "native of Italy" 
stones. 
Tried to find some of the places mentioned on the stones 
(and in interviews), but no luck. 
Poor map (Times world atlas) 
and too much time passed, maybe. 
Will check with good map 
later. 
Met Connie Hicks at Masonic Lodge at 11:00 am. 
Nice (see 
F110489 not 
e s
Connie has done 
 quite a bit of res_earc• to 
Eureka's—history, especially the first district attorney who was 
in Eureka. 
She is to send us some info she_ha-_ about—Ita-1ians.in 
Eureka. 
She took us to Al Biale's house, introduced us, but Al 
was fixing lunch, so we agreed to come back at 1:30 or so, which 
we did. 
Al Biale is a grrnt guy and-an interviewer's dream. 
He is 
86, sharp, in good health, remembers places, names, dates, 
events--everything. 
Good sense of humor, good talker. 
He is 
involved, and has been for some time, with the local historical 
society, and was responsible for erecting a monument to the five 
carbonari massacred during the "charcoal burners war" of _1879. 
His father came to Eureka from Northern Italy (named town, but I 
couldn't find on map later) to burn charcoal, but had gone hack 
to Italy shortly before the murders. 
Talked about growing up
—in 
Eureka, ge 
to tather's store business ("Eureka Cash 
Store"), pranks as a kid (building fire near narrow gauge train 
depot to make people think train--which was always late--had 
IAW-BO-F110589 - 
2 
arrived). 
Al-says when he was in school_ as_a_kid_in Euraka, 
other kids used to call Italian-  kids Dagos and WOPs; indicates, 
perhaps, that although there were a good number or Italians 
there, they were still in the minority. 
After all, the mines and 
smelters were owned by "Englishmen." 
Al lives in a stone house built as office and manager's 
residence for the smelter just across road. 
Built ca. 1870s, but 
doesn't know builder. 
In fact, he doesn't identify any 
particular family or name with building in the area, nor did 
Louis Gibellini. 
Al says Italians were known as the builders, 
especially rock builders, but so were the Germans. 
He doesn't 
know much about 
the buildings in town, certainly not who built 
them. 
We ought to follow up with some very specific buildings, 
however; perhaps photos of houses, etc, will jog his memory. 
Long shot, though. 
Took a few photos--portraits--outside after interview. 
Too 
dark in house; flash batteries too low to use. 
Will return next 
trip to town with specific questions. 
Will also document house 
with photos and measured drawings, and take more photos of Al. 
Cruised town checking out buildings for future study; 
roadside scholarship. 
Photoed partially fallen in stone building 
built into tufa (volcanic) stone outcroppings. 
very much in the 
same fashion as the Delmue Ranch in Lincoln County. 
Tufa is very 
soft and can be cut and shaped with an axe. 
Great for building 
(they say it offers pretty good insulation, unlike most stone), 
but cannot be used for foundation; it sucks up moisture like a 
porous sponge. 
There are lots of tufa buildings in 
town, but 
most are of granite (or granite like) stone. 
Couple of churches * 
are real nice and will document. 
Got good info about Italians in Eureka of a general sort, 
but not much about them as builders. 
More work needed. 
Al Biale 
is the starting point, and he mentioned a couple of other people, 
including a woman (name on tape; forgot) who he says will be very 
helpful. 
In the evening, took photos of town at night; mostly neon 
signs. 
Street shots were too dark, but few of neon shots OK, 
including Louis'. 
Town still dead.

One new fence around

Nice. 
Steel, welded nicely 
and decoratively. 
CHARCOAL OVEN 
Went with AG to the only remaining 
charcoal otien in the 
Eureka area. 
Located on east side of Diamond Valley, Nbrt$ of 
town:  Stopped and  visited with director of Eureka museuinn, and 
friend of Al Biale (can't remember name; see Andrea Graham's 
notes for this date). 
She is young, knowledgeable, and 
interested. 
We'll keep in touch. 
She gave us directions to 
oven; can see it from her house with binoculars. 
Oven is large, larger slightly than those I've seen in 
Lincoln County. 
About 25 feet across base on the inside, and 30 
to 35 feet tall. 
Well built from shaley rock found in abundance 
there. 
Why ovens in Diamond Valley, but none ever built in Fish 
Creek area? 
Lack of materials? 
Too hard to haul wood to central 
place there? 
Need to find out if we can. 
There is also the 
remains of a small house next to the oven, and what appears to be 
a road bed below the oven. 
A rock wall above the oven is still 
intact; where a ramp went to the upper window for loading the 
wood. 
The Bureau of Land Management has built a fence around the 
area to keep cattle (and fourwheelers?) from causing any damage 
there. 
Shot pretty much film, a good bit of which turned out to 
be a tad overexposed. 
Need to check my meter; too many of my 
shots are a tad overexposed. 
What is the history of the carbonari in Italy? 
Ask John 
Alexander when he comes. 
Flew back to Carson City via Austin; took aerials of Benny 
Damele's Dry Creek Ranch. 
Saw him walking in the road, waved. 
Got back about 4:30 pm.

Arrived ca. 4:OOpm. 
Checked into Eureka Motel, walked around town looking at 
buildings and such, including arched domed thing (whatever it 
is/was--historic photo in NHS, Reno), went to Louie's Lounge, 
talked long time with Louis and his daughter Janelle Dietrich, 
and her husband Hank Dietrich. 
She helps Louis remember and 
keeps up good conversation; nice info about Prospect, Ruby Hill, 
etc. 
AG took notes. 
Talked about Louis's wife's father, A. C. 
Florio. 
Hank told me about John Jaurequito (5000 Lakeside Dr., 
Reno 885-0477) who worked in the mines at Ruby Hill. 
Now an 
electrician in Reno; runs JJ Electric in Reno. 
He's 55-60 years 
old they say. 
His wife's folks are Eureka people, too; Herrara. 
Rose Herrara is in Reno and is Mrs. Juaraquito's mother; said to 
be good source of info about Eureka Italians. 
Looked at late 
19th century saddle made specially for him; silve mounted, slight 
swells, high cantle, square skirts, tapaderos. 
Louis talked  of 
making and using skiis 
 to get to work at the mine; had to be 
there  thirty days a month, so needed skiis to meet obligation. 
Still has skiis, will-see,--tom6rrow al"hotograph with hilu

also go with Louis to where he was born in Prospect; house still 
standing. 
Went to Owl Club for steak supper.

stones, etc, that didn't 
urn out last time; esp.  
metal flowered 
wreaths and beaded wreaths,  plus Damele, Gibellini and Biale 
stones. 
Picked up Louis Gibellini at his bar (house) and went with 
him to site of Prospect, now called Diamond Mine, but don't know 
why (Diamond Peak in north of town; Prospect is south). 
Louis -
talked about growing up there between 1907 (birth) till he was 14 
(1921). 
AG recorded most of his talk, much of what he repeated 
from other conversations. 
The house she was born in is 
 still_ 
the-r--&. took photos, including seve ral wi-fh Louis posed in front. 
DW_and I took— lots of shots. 
Some scenics shouia be good. 
Prospect is situated in a steep canyon with access in and out to 
the north. 
It gets snowed in just about every year, and Louis 
talked a lot about how deep the drifts used to be -- up to 18 or 
20 feet deep. 
They rode horses along ridges to get to town 
(canyons and roads too deep), rode "sleighs" (ie: sleds -- not 
horse drawn) and walked back or stayed in town. 
Told us about 
homemade skiis he made and how he used them to go to Windfall on 
th-LY`other (south) side of the mountain from Prospect. 
When we 
returned to Eureka he dug the skiis out from under the house. 
They_-are 
' 
' 
8-6-' 
long-and 4" wide-­w`
T•Eh grooves in the runner like 
"regular" skii*, the tops of old boots fixed onto the skiis to 
hold the toe of the users shoes or boots, pieces of old tire for 
help hold the foot in place and not slide to the side. 
He.—qgys 
he used _one pole for balance, etc, not two as today. 
This is 
very 19th century—and Scandinavian,  
according to what I've 
learned about people like Snowshoe Thompson who skied the Sierras 
delivering mail, and from old engravings of skiers in the old 
country. 
DT and I took lots of photos of Louis with his skiis. 
Left Louis's place about 11:00, took photos of sheet metal 
dance hall on south end of town. 
Didn't measure, etc; too little 
time. 
Will do so either later this week, or when Tom Carter is 
with us. 
Bought groceries at store; picnicked west of Eureka

heading toward Austin. 
Windy; dusty. 
DAMELE 
Went to Dry Creek Ranch, talked with Pam Eddy, Bob Eddy's 
wife, who told us Bob and Benny were working on a well across the 
valley. 
Described how to get there; headed out. 
Met Bob and Benny coming out with two trucks. 
Stopped, 
talked, told them what we were doing, chatted. 
He's more than 
willing to help. 
We'll go back soon. 
Benny recently had bout 
with colon cancer and spots on his liver. 
Surgery apparently 
took care of colon cancer, and chemo therapy handled spots. 
Benny said he never go sick or lost any hair during therapy, so 
went back to work. 
Looks the same as I remember, perhaps a tad 
thinner. 
I expect Pam's regular cooking is helping get his 
weight back. 
Left; got back to Virginia City about 6:30 or so. 
Down to Reno for Basque meal at Louis' Basque Corner. 
Said bye 
to John. 
David will meet us tomorrow AM for flight to Lincoln

LINCOLN COUNTY 
Monday morning, DT took JW to airport in Reno, came to 
Virginia City. 
He, me and AG drove to Carson City, got in plane, 
flew to Lincoln County. 
Trip uneventful, fairly smooth; just a 
few chops over the ridges. 
Met at Lincoln County Airport by 
Carol (Neldon Mathew's secretary) in old state trooper car. 
Returned to high school/school district office (Neldon is County 
School Superintendent). 
Left in car for Cathedral, the cafe at 
the "Y", where the road to Panaca T's into N/S road (US93?). 
Lunch. 
Drove to Pioche, 11 miles N. 
Visited with Pete and Marlene 
Delmue. 
Arrived a little later than we thought; about 2:00 or 
SO. 
They showed us around their house, which Pete built. 
Pretty 
impressive. 
Split logs with insulation between, full of native 
and other natural materials (rock, logs, boards of different 
woods) from Wyoming, Idaho and Nevada. 
Saw incredible barbecue 
grill Pete built last summer; complete with three mowing machine 
wheels placed above in classic bilateral, tripartite fashion. 
Pete had to go to the ranch to feed a few cows he has there, so I 
rode with him in his truck, AG and DT followed in car. 
Pgte 
pointed out -- by point-; 
in rranaral directions -- where his 
grandfather (Joe, sr.) had sawmills up on Crease Canyon and up on 
• 
Mt. 
—Wilson, w ere he sawed lumber and timbers for his house. 
This was in the late 1890s; house completed and moved into  
Christmas Day, 1900., We followed Pete around as he walked around 
the ranch pointing what was built when, and telling stories about 
the place. 
AG recorded; DT and I took lots of photos. 
Went into 
house, introduced DT and AG to Jody Delmue, Pete's nephew's wife. 
(Jody married to Pete Tony, Pete's brother Frank's son. 
They 
live in the old home place and are keeping it up fairly well. 
Frank lives around the hill, through the gap where the railroad 
ran, in a partially subterranean house). 
Toured house a bit. 
I 
asked Jody if she still had the old photos of the place, she said 
yes. 
We  got three drawers fu-11 of old phnctns out, laid them on 
the pool 
 table in the main room, and DT and I went thrnug 
, 
picking out about 60 to be copied. 
There were one or two nice 
histor 
,ic photos which I had seen earlier that I did not see this 
time. 
Need to ask Jody next trip out.

By this time it was getting dark, so we headed out; Pete 
went home, we went to Caliente to check into a motel. 
Went to 
the Caliente Hot Springs Motel, but they were full. 
The railroad 
(UP) is doing track work in the area, so in addition to about 10 
or 12 crew cars, the motels in town are full or nearly so. 
Went 
to the Midway, they had a room, checked in, walked to the 
Branding Iron for supper. 
After returned form supper, AG and I 
copied the photos we borrowed; AG did logs, I shot pictures. 
The 
extension arm that attaches to a tripod is great; no problems. 
TV and bed.

Breakfast at Branding Iron around 7:30, then to see Neldon 
Mathews, Lincoln County School superintendent and the person who 
loans me a car when I fly to area. 
He is also a recent Arts 
Council member. 
DT talked with him about the project, and how 
nice the Delmue place was for it. 
Nice social call. 
Went to Delmue Ranch to return photos. 
Talked short time 
with Jody Delmue. 
She left. 
We poked around the place a little 
while; DT took few more photos. 
Drove to Pioche and returned 
photo album to Pete and Marlene Delmue's. 
They were gone to 
Cedar City (where people around there go when they go to town) to 
sell a few cows. 
Took photos of their place and the extensive 
yard art/scenes they have built. 
These folks are energetic. 
Pete recently turned 62. 
Took photos of some deer jerky they 
have drying in their garage. 
It is heavily salted, three to five 
inches long, one or two inches wide, and about 1/4 inches thick. 
Took photos of the barbecue grill with iron wheels above it. 
Went to Pioche (named after Francois Pioche; incidentally, 
pioche means pick-ax in French: coincidence?). 
Had lunch at the 
Silver Cafe; hasn't changed in the three years I've been going 
there. 
Visited Linda Cole, who recently remarried, lives in 
Cedar, but still comes to Pioche to keep her manicure business 
open twice a week--Mondays and Tuesdays. 
Don't know her new 
name. 
Linda told us about Pnete (Ester) Cole Silliman, who lives 
in Panaca (first place off the road to the right as you turn to 
go to Panaca off the main drag) who was a Fogliani and knows 
about the Fogliani Ranch up Spring Valley, N of Ursine and Eagle 
Valley. 
She says not much left of the place, and from her 
description, the house was frame, perhaps I house or full 
Georgian plan. 
Corrals, etc, still there, but house is gone. 
To airport in Panaca, loaded up, flew back to Carson. 
Rough 
in the beginning, but smoothed out nicely about half way across. 
Supper at home with DT; spaghetti with clam sauce, of course! 
Over the two days in Panaca, AG and I took 12 rolls of B&W 
IAW-BO-F111489 - 
2 
(including three making copies of old photos), and 7 rolls of 
slides. 
Also recorded 2 hours of tape.

EUREKA 
Flew from Las Vegas to Dry Creek Ranch (Benny Damele). 
Arrived about 2:45 or so and landed on short stretch of road at 
gate to ranch; very narrow, fairly rough (rutted) and about 750 
feet long. 
Elevation 6,500'+; not much lift. 
Wouldn't attempt 
it with more than one person on board or on a hot day. 
Andrea 
met me and we drove to where Benny was moving cows to a field 
where they would be loaded in a day or so and taken to sale in 
Fallon at Gallagher's livestock auction--the only cattle auction 
in Nevada. 
Talked with Benny a while, talked for a while and took some 
photos, went back to house where we walked around looking at 
buildings. 
I didn't realize that the roof of the old part of the 
house is great basin style dirt with very shallow pitch, willows 
covered with straw, covered with dirt. 
This roof is built over 
with the tin roof added when the house was enlarged. 
Steeper 
pitch, tin covering. 
But the old dirt roof is still clearly 
visible. 
Too dark for photos, but will take some when next 
visit. 
The central part of the house is the old section, and the 
shed out the rear newer, but present when the Dameles moved to 
the place I think in the early 1940s. 
The cellar off to the side 
next to the kitchen is about the same age as the shed addition; 
perhaps 1920s or so, but not sure; Benny doesn't know either. 
The room where the front door now opens is built of stone and 
built by an Irishman (see AGs notes for name). 
It has fireplace 
which is burning all the time in the winter. 
Until this year, 
Dry Creek had no electricity at all, and this year they hooked up 
two auto batteries with a trickle solar charger to run a word 
processor and, if they choose, one 15 watt bulb. 
They convert DC 
to AC. 
The batteries last several hours with no problems, and 
they say there are absolutely no power surges; the current is 
steady. 
We sat around and had supper; spaghetti with meat sauce, 
avocados, some kind of store bought bread buns that was toasted 
in the gas oven, red wine. 
Pam [Eddy] does the cooking now that 
she and Bob [Eddy] live there full time. 
Sat around the fire 
IAW-BO-F111889 -

after dinner talking about everything; Bob and Pam's kid Link, 
who likes to work at Dry Creek but is going to college in Twin 
Falls. 
They say he hates it, and will probably finish this 
semester, quit and come to dry creek to work. 
They don't seem 
too worried about it; if anything, they almost encourage it. 
They know where his heart lies, I guess. 
Link is very interested 
in ranching; he helps Benny make mecartys when he's around, so 
helps keep Benny in shape for making them. 
He is tall,thin, 
wears glasses; a nice kid. 
Also talked a little about their 
daughter who is a senior at University of Nevada at Reno this 
semester (I have forgotten her name for the moment). 
She was in 
the Nevada Day parade riding a curly horse; one of Benny's I 
guess. 
AG and I left for Eureka about 7:30 or so. 
Left plane at 
the ranch; will pick up tomorrow.

Saw Louis Gibellini at the Owl Club at breakfast. 
He said 
his granddaughter was in town and had brought the stuff they 
asked her to; old photos, papers, etc. 
We arranged with Louis to 
meet him at his place in about an hour (9:OOam). 
Took a few photos of Eureka from the hill to the East side 
of town. 
Nice morning light. 
Went to Louis's. 
Chatted with he and his daughter Jannelle, 
her husband Hank and, when she appeared, their daughter Jacque 
(Jacqualeene) Campbell. 
She is the keeper of the records for the 
family now, it appears. 
She has a sincere interest in her 
grandfather's history and life, and is taking at least some pains 
to keep a record of it. 
We went through the stuff--old 
newspapers (most 1970s), photo album, certificates, ribbons from 
Tonopah's 1989 Jim Butler Days where Louis was Grand Marshall of 
the parade. 
Andrea wrote down the stuff that was there (see her 
notes about same). 
Took photos and some other papers outside 
where I set up camera copy deal and made copy photos. Neatest 
photos was one of the school at Prospect (where Louis was born 
and went to school). 
Louis identified every person in the 
picture except the teacher; he could only remember her first name 
(Elizabeth). 
Photo circa 1914 or so; Louis says he was about 7 
when it was taken. 
Done with photos; sat around and chatted about general 
matters. 
Janelle told ahnut her mother making ravd_Qe—u-sing 
brains, her parents making grapp-a, wine, brandy and sausage_._ 
Tried to get info about Grappa especially, but everyone pretty 
vague. 
Louis's mother make it in the storage cellar, but neither 
Louis nor Janelle could remember how the still was heated. 
Talked about the seasonal nature of the cellar; certain seasons 
certain things were in the cellar; cheeses, sausages, potatoes 
and carrots. 
They did not go into detail about what was there 
when. 
Janelle did say her mother stored her carrots, and I think 
potatoes, buried in sand in the cellar. 
Cheeses were stored in 
IAW-BO-F111989 - 
2 
boxes set into the walls with screen wire across them to keep the 
flys out. 
Janelle also said her mother would hand cheese in a 
cloth bag on the cloths line and every so often twist the bag to 
squeeze the liquid out. 
She did not know the names of any 
particular cheeses her mother made. 
She did say her mother made 
goat cheese which the kids all hated. 
Janelle said the next time 
she and her daughter make raviole, "ravioles" as she says, she 
will write the recipe down for us. 
She doesn't use brains, but 
the seasoning and basic stuff are how her mother used to make it, 
and, she says, how her grandmother used to make it, too. 
It will 
be nice to have the present generation's variation of the old 
family recipe. 
AG took good notes about the food talk while we 
were talking; see her notes. 
We will make copies of some of the photos we copied, plus 
some of Louis which I took. 
Send them to Louis and to his 
granddaughter; Jacque Campbell, 6328 A Buena Vista, Newark, CA 
94560. 
Left about 11:00 for Dry Creek. 
Had picnic on tailgate of 
truck at the Bean Flat; took photos of AG eating lunch. 
On the 
Dry Creek. 
Took off for home; buzzed Benny who waved bye; I did 
same. 
Arrived Carson about 3:10 pm.

DRY CREEK RANCH 
Left Las Vegas about 8:OOam for Dry Creek Ranch (Benny 
Damele) by air. 
Arrived about 2 hours later; landed on 750 feet 
of road in front of gate to ranch. 
Dropped Andrea off where she 
was to meet Valerie Parks. 
Took off for Elko where I arrived 
about 11:00 am and picked up Tom Carter. 
Christmas shopped about 
45 mins in town, then left for Dry Creek. 
Arrived about 12:00 or 
SO. 
Introduced Benny to Tom, and Tom to Valerie. 
Poked around 
the place a bit. 
TC was taken with Dry Creek (3D brand). 
Very 
nice stone stable, which TC and I measured and drew. 
Walked up 
to corrals above house and where original home was. 
This house 
is log and mud. 
Horiz log on one side, added to with mud and 
willow construction. 
This construction is fairly common in 
central Nevada, and remotely similar to west Texas jacal  
construction. 
Vertical posts (juniper, locally called cedar) are 
placed in the ground about 4 - 5 feet apart, forming a rough 
square or rectangle. 
1-2 inch willow saplings are nailed 
horizontally inside and out between the verticals, with about 2-3 
inches between them. 
As the wall of horizontal strips goes up, 
they are infilled with alkali mud mixed with rocks, hair, sticks, 
etc. 
This particular house used very large stones for the 
infill, larger than any other I have seen (I've seen about 60 or 
so throughout Nevada). 
The stones were softball sized and even 
some a little larger. 
This mud dries hard as cement and is very 
durable in a dry climate; this house was perhaps 100 years old or 
so, and still in fair shape, excepting the roof. 
Mud 
construction is usually attributed to indians, either Shoshone or 
Paiute, and are often called "Indian houses." 
Benny's father 
Peter, according to family tradition, spoke Italian and Shoshone 
before he spoke English. 
We took some photos of the place, then 
helped Benny and Bob Eddy (cowboy) move a calf into a tight place 
so she could be vaccinated for something. 
Walked back to main ranch HQ. 
TC and I then measured and 
drew the stable while Valerie took a bunch of photos of various 
buildings, including the house, stable, blacksmith shop, and 
several portraits of Benny and Bob.

As was approaching dark, went into house where everyone but 
me (had to fly later) had a glass of "Dago red." 
TC and I poked 
around the house interior, talked with Benny about its history, 
and made measured drawing of it. 
It is a fairly complex place. 
One notable feature is the roof. The old roof over the original, 
stone structure is a very flat, dirt affair, just like one would 
expect in that area, and is covered with a newer roof built right 
above the old, but the old still shows in the eves. 
The new roof 
is tin. 
There are two stone cellars built off to one side of the 
house that are now joined to the house with a roof over a breeze 
way that has been boxed in. 
Benny also showed us his huge gun 
collection; very nice. 
At dark I took off for Eureka airport where the rest would 
meet me; Valerie had her car. 
Very dark flight of about 20 
minutes, but no sweat. 
Arrived in Eureka where we checked into 
the Sundowner Motel, and had supper at the Owl Club. 
TC was 
feeling pretty bad, on the verge of flu he thought, so went to 
bed early.

Breakfast at Owl Club. 
Drove around town to get Tom Carter 
and Valerie Parks acclimated to the place. 
Andrea took car and 
went to Al Biali's and interviewed him again, asking specific 
questions that we didn't ask the first time. 
TC went to 
courthouse and got Sanborn maps of Eureka, ca. 1880, and Valerie 
and I walked to the brick house behind Al's Hardware run by Jerry 
White, AB's son-in-law. 
Interesting house. 
Used originally as a 
boarding house by AB's grandmother, and had large frame addition 
out the back, which more than doubled its size. 
Frame part now 
gone, so brick part looks very tall and skinny. 
Very nice 
features, however, especially the steep roof and arched windows. 
VP took photos, and TC joined us there, where we measured it and 
made floor plan. 
Went to Louis Gibellini's. 
Met him at breakfast and said 
we'd come by shortly, so did. 
He showed us his blacksmith shop, 
where he sharpens his drilling steels, and VP took photos inside 
and out, and TC and I measured it and made drawing. 
VP also took 
some portraits of LG. 
AG met us at LG's, and we all went to the old assay 
office/warehouse complex built against the tufa cliff across the 
flood ditch on the East side of town. 
TC and I measured and drew 
the office, took photos (as did VP) and generally tried to figure 
it out. 
Had lunch afterwards. 
Went to AB's house where we measured and drew his place, 
talked a while, and VP took photos. 
He sure is a wealth of good 
information. 
Went to see very small stone house next to a turn of the 
century frame house (which AB called a "typical" miner's house) 
up the hill in the west side of town. 
No one home at the frame 
place, which was once owned by Louis G's brother John. 
The stone 
one was abandoned; no one there. 
Measured it from outside, took 
photos, as did VP.

Went to Louie's Lounge, had beer, talked with LG and his 
daughter Jannette and her husband Hank Dietrich. 
Supper at the

DELMUE RANCH 
Breakfast at the Eureka Cafe. 
Packed up our stuff, jammed 
it into plane, took off for Lincoln County (Panaca). 
Plane very 
heavy; right at gross weight or even tad over, but did fine. 
Bumpy at start; Tom Carter and Valerie Parks almost got sick, but 
smoothed out after about 30 mins. 
Arrived about 11:OOam or so, picked up old highway patrol 
car loaned by Neldon Mathews (school superintendent), went to 
Cathedral Restaurant for coffee and to stretch. 
Car wouldn't 
start when left cafe, called Leo Prestwich (asst supt) who 
brought us an old truck to use. 
Left for town to show TC and VP 
the place. 
Very nice example of small, outpost, agrarian Mormon 
settlement. 
Grid town layout, several ca. 1870s - 80s adobe and 
log houses, most double-pen. 
Look like midwestern houses and 
small houses in rural Utah. 
TC took several photos for himself. 
Bought kippered herring, sardines, crackers, etc for lunch later 
on. 
V 
Drove to Delmue Ranch which lies in Dry Valley. 
TC and VP 
stunned at how great the place is. 
VP immediately started taking 
photos while the light was right. 
AG and I introduced TC and VP 
to Jody Delmue (married to Pete Tony Delmue, Pete's nephew) who 
lives on the place. 
Walked around, began measuring and drawing 
buildings, taking photos. 
TC and AG measured the 1880 barn, and 
all three of us the vaulted cellar/catacomb-y place behind the 
house. 
Valerie took large format shots of this spot. 
This space 
is long and narrow, and used to be used in the summer as an 
eating place (cool) where the hay hands (including manv Italians 
who  came out f-or a week or so iri the summer on vacation from 
their mining jobs in Pioche) ate and cooled off. 
There are a 
couple of historic phntog ;n the Delmue collection that show 
young men holding wine bottles up to their lips. 
I took copy 
photos of these the last time we were down. 
TC was not familiar with the plan of the house itself. 
Said 
he'd have to do some research to find out about it, but he 
suspected it was maybe somewhat typical of northern Italy or 
southern Switzerland. 
Del mues are from Biasca, Switzerland, 
IAW-BO-F120989 -

about ten miles north of the border,- R r-th—c-f—MI-emu,. 
VP took 
several large format shots of the interior of the large front 
room, including details of the doors that go into the side 
bedrooms , and the fireplace and wood storage bin carved out of 
the tufa stone that forms part of the back wall of the house. 
According the Pete Delmue , his qrandmother cooked for 
ems 
in 
the fi_enlace before thQ kit•h_Pn was adde 
ou 
e rear. 
The 
fireplace is very small , bet he says it had "hooks" to cook from, 
and that she did very well. 
The main house is built in the rear 
so that a stone kitchen wing could be tied into it at the corner; 
stones are left sticking out, thereby giving something to tie the 
new construction to, 
The kitchen , however, is made of railroad 
ties, not stone. 
Left ranch a little after dark. 
Jody Delmue was very 
patient and helpful for the whole day; deserves a reward. 
Checked into the Caliente Hot Springs motel, went to supper 
before the restaurant closed (Branding Iron), then took a soak in 
the hot springs . Felt great!

Left Lincoln County after breakfast at the Branding Iron. 
Uneventful flight, just heavy and mushy controls. 
Dropped VP and 
AG off at Eureka airport where they got in VP's car, went to 
town. 
I flew TC to Elko where his car was. 
He had to return to 
Salt Lake by 6:OOpm. 
After TC left, flew back to Eureka where AG 
an VP met me. 
Went to look at "Italian ranches"; virtually nothing of age 
left on the place we saw. 
Returned to Eureka. 
AG and I went to the stone house on the north end of town on 
main street currently owned by the Ed and Hellen Melka. 
See AGs 
notes about history of house. 
Nice house, and they told us how 
they changed the interior walls in the front in order to make 
them larger. 
Reduced number of rooms from three to two. 
Did 
measured drawing of plan, both as is and as it was. 
It was 
originally two apartments ( a duplex) and the Melkas say it was 
used as a brothel, but Al Biale says he doesn't think so. 
The 
Melkas have lived in it since the 1940s when they moved to Eureka 
from Michigan. 
Helen Melka used to play guitar and mandolin 
music and sing, though she didn't this day. 
I'd like to hear her 
some time. 
They came to work in the mines and stayed. 
The cellar that runs behind the house and off to one side is 
huge -- 48 feet long. 
Did measured drawing of it, too. 
The 
place used to be a brewery, and beer was stored in the cellar. 
The brewery was located in the lot adjacent to the stone house. 
AG has info about the brewery in her notes, but I think it was 
run by a German and an Italian. 
Nearly dark when we left. 
VP was taking photos at the assay 
office and warehouse while we were at the Melka place; light for 
the Melka place not good for photos; will do in the morning. 
Loafed around, had Chinese dinner at Eureka Cafe (run by 
Chinese couple).

After supper, AG and I went to John and Roberta Damele's 
place. 
John is Benny's cousin. John's father Steve was Benny's 
father's older brother. 
(See AGs notes for more genealogical 
info). 
Did taped interview with John and Roberta Merialdo 
Damele. 
John raised at Tonkin ranch, she raised in Eureka. 
He 
cowboyed all his life, and considers himself a buckaroo, or says 
he used to be. 
Says buckaroo culture certainly in Lander County, 
which confirms our earlier information that this is so. 
Says he 
never really did rawhide braiding or hair twisting, but that a 
lot of people did. 
General talk about working on ranch and the 
Demale clan as ranchers. 
Roberta has several recipes from her mother and grandmother, 
including 
— several  slie copied down when-she was in the eighth 
g 
r a's mother, not Italian, learned to cook from her 
husband's mother, who was. 
Took photos of sPVPr_al reci_pp__cards 
and sheets in the 1Pdr3er_A=okbook. 
AG wrote several down, too. 
Seems -the classic homemade Italian dish that connotQs 
"Italianness" is raviola.. 
Louis Gibellini's wife and daughter 
make (made) it, as does Roberta Demale.

(Better double check 
this; Roberta may still use brains; it's certainly still on the

Rnlaexta was very nice, if a little hesitant at 
first. 
Had good - info re: food and her family. 
Her father was 
county recorder for a num er o 
ears, and then state controller. 
Both she and John went to college; she to UC-Berkeley and studied 
Chemistry, he went to UC-Davis (I think) and studied agriculture 
(I think). 
He now has pretty bad emphysema. 
I noticed a pack of 
cigarettes in the living room, but no one smoked while we were 
there. 
Took bunch of photos, with and without flash, B&W and color, 
then left about 9:OOpm.

VP took photos in the am of the Melka house, as did I. 
Exteriors only. 
I took a few interiors of their "shrine corner" 
(where the TV and musical instruments are) the day before. 
Nicely arranged corner. 
Someone needs to do study of the 
changing place of the family memo spot. 
Used to be the mantle 
(still is in many homes so equipped), but shifting more and more 
(seems to me) to where the TV is. 
Hmmmm. 
Nothing profound here, 
I'm sure we've all seen it, but I think there's quite a change 
illustrated here. 
Says a lot. 
VP took AG and I to airplane, went on her way, heading back 
to Reno. 
Tried to start plane, wouldn't; too cold; 10 degrees. 
Had to hand prop it, took about an hour before it finally 
started. 
Blew small bit of interior baffle out of muffler. 
Pulled muscle in my back propping it; getting old I guess. 
Flew home; arrived about 1:OOpm. 
Tired. 
A long but
