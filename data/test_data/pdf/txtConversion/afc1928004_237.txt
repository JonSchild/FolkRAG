To squeete out a

When somebody nice is near, 
There's somebody behind us so, 
May softly stolen embrace achieve, 
Shrieking alarms caught in his arms 
We faint—that is, we make believe.

THE YOUNG LADY WITH THE CURLY HEAD 
OF HAIR. 
I HAVE such a 
lot of beaux, all eager to propose, 
But they're none of them approved of by mamma, 
And she keeps so strict a 
guard over am, that's very hard, 
For I'm fond of beaux, as all young ladies are! 
She will seldom let me out, for she knows they stroll about, 
In the hope that they will catch a 
glimpse of me; 
But as by the house they go, through the windows oft they 
throw 
Little notes I 
read when ma's not there to sea. 
SPOKEN.—Which generally contains something to this effect— 
CHORUS. 
Are you coming out to-night, for the moon is shining bright, 
And the little stars are peeping here and there; 
I 
am waiting here in doubt, oh! are you coming out ? 
Little beauty with the curly head of hair. 
There is handsome Harry Lee, who is deep in love with me, 
Whom I 
met at cousin Henrietta's ball; 
But mamma declares him poor, says he's courted girls before, 
And she will never speak well of him at all. 
But he often passes by, and Fin sure I 
don't know why, 
But I 
at the open window sit and sew; 
And my heart beats very fast, as he whispers going past, 
In that voice of his so musically low. 
Are you coming out, etc. 
(1)

THE YOUNG LADY WITH THE CURLY HEAD 
OF HAIR.—Continued. 
Then there's Frank, who apes the swell, still I 
like him very 
well, 
Though I 
look upon him only as a " beau ;" 
He will often wait about, pleading " Arn't you coming out," 
And declares it wrong of ma to treat him so. 
Then there's merry Philip Drew, he's a 
dear, but he's poor too, 
And so daring, not afraid of ma at all; 
She's not deaf, so she must hear, when his voice rings out so 
clear, 
As beneath my window he will often call, 
Are you coming out, etc. 
If alone to walk I 
go, I 
am sure to meet a 
beau, 
Nearly crazed with joy to catch me out alone ; 
But there's one—I 
won't say who—of no consequence to you, 
Fond of me, and—well—my heart is all his own. 
Ile is handsome, good, but poor; that's a 
fault ma won't ignore; 
But it shall not make a 
difference with me; 
For—you needn't tell mamma, but some day we really are 
Goina to run away to church and married be. 
SPOILF:N.—Tben there will be no need for any to say— 
Are you coming out, etc.

Salt water, you know, is very wet, 
Oh, Nicodemus! 
You know you are my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret. 
They will feed you on salt junk 
And nasty soft-boiled peas; 
Think of this well, Nicodenms, 
Ere you cross those watery seas, 
Those windy, watery seas.— Cho. 
Of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, 
Oh, Nicodemus! 
Convince yourself of this before, 
You can't run away, there's no back-door.

You'll have to hold on by your eye-brows, 
Or you'll be blown away 
Straight down to Botany Bay.—Cho. 
It is no use your talking to me, 
Said Nicodemus; 
For I 
intend a-going to sea, 
Out to China for Souchong and Congo teL 
That's a 
profitable cargo,. 
In fact, you can't get better; 
Direct " Hong Kong," Australia, 
Where you send me a 
letter, 
You send to me a 
letter.— Cho.

OYSTERS AND WINE AT 2 A. M. 
I'm a 
maiden who never refuses, 
The pleasures that come in my way, 
For now is the time to be merry, 
To be bashful is but to delay; 
When the stars far above us are shining, 
With a 
party of friends, but a 
few, 
Quick the night passes by and we finish, 
With oysters and wine at 2.

Down by the country side, lives old Gray the miller, 
Down by the side of the millstream tide, grows a

Under the wilier tree sat the miller's daughter,

song and gazin' keg into the bubhlin' water—Liquid, 
She sat by the side of the bubblin' water, 
Under the weepin' wilier, tree. 
Tears fell from her eyes, hands she WSJ a

She looked to the right, she looked to the left, and then looked

Then she did prepare her mortal life to injure,

SCHNEIDER'S RIDE. 
A 
Recitation written by Oofty Gooft and delivered by Gus Wn 
LIAMS with great applause. 
From gross der rifer, ad broke of day, 
Bringin' by Brooklyn fresh dismay, 
Per news vas send, by a 
Dutlehman drue, 
Dot der officers of der refenue

To confiscate all der visky dey got 
In Schneider's blace, or near der shbot. 
Und vilder yed dem rumors dey flew, 
Dill Schneider didn'd know vat to do ; 
So he glosed der doors mid barred dem (light, 
Saying, " Dey kin hammer avay mit all der might ; 
Of dey ghl dem oben before id's night, 
Den I

Who is der shinardesd, dem or me I" 
For a

Shdill Schneider shdaid righd on der shbot. 
Bud dere is a

Dot isn'd bated, dot leads righd down 
To Gulley Island, und vat is more 
(Dot's a

Id vas righd in frond of der back of der shdore, 
Und dere on dot road vas nine drucks und a 
cart, 
Loading mit visky all ready to shdart; 
Defre mosd all loaded, und Schneider Is gay, 
In den momends he'll be boud a

Dey're off, und noding is lef to show 
Vat vay dey made ub cleir minds to go, 
Und oferyding's 'noted. yed nod a

Kin be heerd bud der veels agoin around, 
As (ley mote so shwifdly ofer der ground; 
Und Schneider looks back und says, " Goot day," 
For now lie's more as fife miles avay. 
SCHNEIDER'S RIDE.—CONCLIIDED. 
Shdill jumbs dem horses, shdill on dey go, 
Und der vay dey mote dot isn'd shlow, 
Dey're goin down hill, mid fasder und tastier, 
Dey're drifen ahead by Schneider, der ' nastier, 
Who sliducks to dem now like a

For Yell he knows dot ir now he's (looked, 
He kin make ub his mind dot his goose vas cooked, 
So efery mussels dey pring in blay, 
Cause dey aind any more as den miles avay 
Under dheir flyin hoofs der road, 
Like a

Now got dired und had to lay down 
To took a

For " Slmneid " und der vagons, dem vent so fasd 
Dot den der flies gifed owl at lasd;

Per wery first ding dot Schneider saw 
Vas der sand, und he heerd der ocean roar. 
He shmelled der salt in der goot oh preeze 
Dot vafed ofer vere dere vasird some drees, 
Und he feld firsd rade mit his mind ad ease. 
Und dem wery horses dem seemed to say—

How do 
you like 
the 
rail - i 
ta - ry 
style? 
I 
joined the ranks so martial, 
As you can plainly see, 
Though to " Reviews" I'm partial, 
No " rifle-butt" I'll be. 
At " small sword exercise" I'm great 
Although perhaps you'll smile, 
I 
do the " goose-step" like a " duck.; 
In military style. 
Cho-rm.—How do you like, &c. 
To " sham fights" I'm devoted, 
And always " gain the day;" 
I'm sure to be promoted 
For " merit" not for " pay." 
I've read the deeds of" Wellington," 
But in a 
little while, 
I 
fancy I 
shall " cut him out" 
In military style. 
Chorus.— How do you like, &c. 
And when there's warfare raging, 
There often is, no doubt, 
With manners so engaging, 
I'll put the foe to rout; 
I'll storm the trenches, scale the walls 
The enemy I'll ' rile," 
And if I'm beat—I'll run away 
In military style. 
Choru.s.—How d.) you like, 8:4t.

"HE IS THE MAN FOR ME." 
Written and composed by G. W. HUNT. 
I SING " Hurrah for our hearts of oak," 
And " Hurrah for the open sea," 
" 
Hurrah for our gallant sailors" too, 
Wherever they may be. 
Hurrah for our army, shout hurrah! 
And our valiant volunteers, 
Hurrah for the men who thrash the foe, 
Whenever he appears. 
CHORUS. 
For they are the men for me, my boys, 
They are the men for me; 
God save our land and bless the tried and true, 
For they are the men for me. 
Hurrah for the man with a 
dollar a 
day, 
And hurrah for the man with two, 
Hurrah for the man with a 
thousand a 
year, 
And who's got no work to do. 
Hurrah for the man with five hundred thousand kads, 
Whoever he may be, 
And hurrah for that man, if he makes his will, 
And leaves it all to me. 
CHORU S. 
Then he is the man for me, my boys, 
lie is the man for me, 
If he left me ev'ry dollar, rd ne'er be out of collar, 
So he'd be the man for me. 
Hurrah for the coon who never feels queer 
When he goes upon the sea, 
Eurrab for the party with a 
heap of poor relations, 
But who never a 
one does see ; 
Hurrah for the henpeck'd husband, who 
Don't wish he'd single tarried, 
And hurrah, hurrah, for the jolly old maid, 
Who doestft wish she'd been married. 
15 
" 
HE IS VTR MAN FOR ME."—Continued. 
CL1ORUS. 
For she's the old maid for me, my boys, 
That's the old maid for me, 
Who don't want man to cheer her, or to come a 
little nearer, 
Then, that's the old maid for me. 
Hurrah for the man who never kick' d 
A " poor unlucky wight" when 1w 18 down; 
Hurrah for the man with a 
cheerful heart, 
Who hasn't got " a 
cheerful ' brown,'" 
Hurrah for the man who never backs 
A 
horse but what he wins, 
And hurrah, hurrah for the " honest working man," 
Who's the father of a 
half a 
dozen twins. 
CHORUS. 
For he's the man for me, my boys, 
He's the man for me ; 
The friend of emigration and a 
surplus population, 
So he's the man for me. 
Hurrah for the wife who has always a 
smile. 
And who is not always wanting a 
new bonnet, 
Hurrah for the man with a 
jovial face, 
And a 
jolly good nose upon it; 
Hurrah, hurrah! for the dear, dear girls, 
May their charms be never less, 
And hurrah for the man who lends a 
helping hand 
To another in distress. 
CHORUS. 
For be's the man for me, my boys, 
He is the man for me, 
And if you like this lay, then I 
am bound to say, 
That you are the men for me.

THOU HASP WOUNDED THE SPIRIT 
THAT LOVED THEE. 
Thou hast wounded the spirit that loved thee, 
And cherished thine image for years, 
Thou hast taught me at last to forget thee, 
In secret, in silence, and tears. 
As the young bird when left by its mother, 
Its earliest pinions to try, 
Round the nest will still lingering hover, 
Ere its trembling wings can fly. 
Thus we're taught in this cold world to smother, 
Each feeling that once was so dear; 
Like that young bird I'll seek to discover 
A home of affection elsewhere. 
Tho' this heart may still cling to thee fondly-
And dream of sweet memories past, 
Yet hope, like the rainbow of summer, 
Gives a 
pr,-
,mise of Lethe at last. 
NEAR THE BANKS OF THAT LONE RrvErtk 
Near the banks of that lone river, 
Where the water lillies grow, 
Breathed the fairest flower that ever 
Bloomed and faded years ago; 
How we met and loved and parted, 
None on earth can ever know„ 
Nor how pure and gentle-hearted, 
Beamed the mourn'd one, years ago. 
CHORUS. 
Near the banks of that lone river, 
Where the water lilies grow, 
Breathed the fairest flower that ever 
Bloomed and faded long ago. 
Like the stream with lilies laden, 
Will life's future current flow, 
Till in heaven I 
meet the maiden, 
Fondly cherished years ago; 
Hearts that love like mine forget not, 
They're the same in weal or woe, 
And that star of memory set not, 
In the grave of years ago. 
Near the banks, cte.

Future years may bring us sorrow, 
That our hearts but little know, 
Still of care we should not borrow; 
Come and kiss me ere I

THE OLD HOME AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO B. 
Oh, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The banjo and the fiddle has gone, 
And no more you hear the darkies singing, 
Among the sugar cane and corn ; 
Great changes has come to the poor colored man, 
But this change makes him sad and forlorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
CHORUS. 
No, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The change makes me sad and forlorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
In the field I've worked when I 
thought ' twas hard, 
But night bro't its pleasure and rest, 
In the old house down by the river side. 
The place of all the world the best. 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
They are scattered now and o'er the world they roam, 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No, the old home, & e. 
Now the old man would rather lived and died 
in the home where his children were born, 
But when freedom came to the colored man, 
lIe left his cotton-field and corn. 
'rids old man has lived out his three-score and ten, 
And he'll soon have to lay down anal 
Yet he hopes to go into a 
better land. 
So now, old cabin home. good-bye. 
No, he out home. &c.

PARODY ON " PUT NE IN NY LITTLE BED." 
Words by JEunt COHEN. 
Sung by BILLY West. 
Oh, Birdie, I 
am exceedingly fatigued at this moment, 
I 
do not care for an exhibition of your vocal abilities, 
All day you've displayed them to satisfactory advantage, 
So put your head beneath it's usual feathered protector. 
I'm sleepy too, the approach of slumber is apparent, 
And, Birdie, when any habitual devotions have been dis-
posed of 
I 
want to prostrate my person in the arms of Morpheus. 
So put me in that soothing harbor designated as my vir-
tuous couch. 
CHORUS. 
Come affectionate feminine relative approach, 
Kiss me with compliments of the hour. 
For I 
any evening devotion have uttered, 
I'm infinitely fatigued and fain would seek repose. 
So put inc in that resting place designated by the usual 
appellation of my little bed. 
Oh, Birdie, repeat the ejaculations of our maternal pro-
teetor, 
When she to the abode of eternal bliss was summoned 
She told me always to assume a 
disposition of amiability, 
And never, never stray from the paths of virtue and pru-
dence. 
ne'er forget the day her spirit departed from its mortal 
casket, 
She placed her digits upon my devoted cranium, 
And whispered softly, retain my obedient offspring. 
And then I 
received information to the effect that she had 
shuffled off this mortal coil. 
Come affectionate, /ft.

BEAUTIFUL LOVE. 
As sung by Grs W ILLIAMS. 
Lovn, love, oh, what is love 7 
love, 'tis that makes man feel so 
peculiar: 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud, a 
Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia 7 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round and 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the first attack it's like raspberry jam, running 
down ones back. 
cnoaus. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, love it is that makes a 
man feel so pecu 
liar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man's but a 
fool when he falls in love. 
Oh, love, when you're in love, to presents, to parties and picnics 
you treat her, 
Oh, love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel just as the' you'd 
like to eat her; 
But the best of loves must part—then an end comes to your 
bliss, 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the 
parting kiss, 
You bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
Oh, love, etc. 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning yourself 
in cold water; 
If it's all rirdit she'll giggle and say, please ask father if I 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, etc. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked- for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beautiful twins. 
Oh love, etc.

Little Robin tell Kitty I'm coming, 
Yes tell her to meet me for sure, 
Oh, say I'll await in the gloaming, 
With love ever constant and pure ; 
How bright is the bloom of the flowers, 
Bedecking the sweet new mown hay, 
While up in the blue heaven's bowers. 
Rings sweetly the nighingale's lay. 
CHORUS. 
Then Robin tell Kit ty I'm coming, 
Yes tell her to meet me for sure. 
Oh, say I'll await in the gloaming, 
With love ever constant and pule. 
Little Robin tell Kitty Pm coming, 
With fondest of hopes in my heart, 
I'll wait where the brooklet is running,— 
Then fly birdie quickly depart; 
I'll be at the foot of the meadow, 
A-down in the shady green dell, 
And there in the oak's spreading shadows, 
Our love for each other we'll tell. 
Then Robin, &c. 
Little Robin tell Kitty I'm coming 
To meet her the same as of yore, 
Time old love is still purely burning,— 
There's none I 
so fondly adore ; 
Then go pretty bird with your message, 
Dont tarry so long in the air, 
But fly dont delay on your passage, 
And tell her be sure to be there.

I've a 
beau you must know, who it is I'll not ten, 
So don't ask for you'll get no reply; 
A dashing fellow, altho' not a 
swell, 
For swells I've no fancy, not I. 
He's a 
true gentleman, and that is a 
rank 
Above titles, which some girls adore ; 
Ali, how my heart beats when I 
hear my dear love 
Give his darling rat tat at the door. 
CHORD'S. 
Oh, how my heart beats whenever I 
hear 
us rat-a- tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, rat-a- tat, tat, tat, tat. 
No Music so sweet, with joy my heart beats, 
When I 
hear my love knock at the door. 
At a 
pie-nic we met, one bright summer's day, 
A day that I 
ne'er shall forget ; 
We stroll'd thro' the woods and some bow lost our way, 
And our hearts, which are not found as yet. 
But I 
aqui: I've found his, I 
know he has mine, 
Tho' parted now forever more; 
Yet still in my dreams I 
can see his eyes shine, 
And hear his rat-a- tat at the door. 
Oh, how my heart, cte. 
He has not yet proposed, but 1 
think he will soon, 
My mirth I've to hide with a 
frown; 
For I 
know the dear fellow has often began, 
And as oft in confusion broke down. 
He has vowed to be mine, in fact we've both vowed 
Each other to love ever more; 
A 
h, whams there a 
girl whose heart beats not fast 
When she hears her love knock at the door. 
Oh, how my heart, ttc.

JOHNNY, THE ENGINE-DRIVER. 
—{CoNCLUDED.] 
My Johnny's eyes are a 
deep dark black, 
And likewise is his hair; 
And so's his face and hands sometimes, 
But for that I 
do not care; 
There's not a 
driver on the line 
So bold and brave as he; 
Oh! I 
am so fond of Johnny,—and 
My Johnny's fond of me. 
CH0.—Oh! my Johnny, (Sze. 
When my love starts on a 
journey, 
On the platform there I 
stand, 
First he makes his engine whistle, 
Then to me he'll kiss his hand; 
His engine puffs, and blows, and goes, 
And I 
watch till out of sight; 
And then I 
long to see my love 
Come back again all right. 
Cno.—Oh! my Johnny, cte. 
There's not another man like him 
Can make the engine scream, 
And can't he make an awful noise, 
When he blows off the steam; 
Along the line at lightning speed, 
My Johnny likes to dash, 
But lor' I 
I 
often quake for fear 
He'll some day go to smash! 
Cno.—Oh! my Johnny, dtc. 
One day he quietly asked if I'd 
His "Stoker" be for life, 
Or rather, to be plainer, would 
I 
be his darling wife! 
So I 
promised to be his "Tender" half, 
Aud he vowed by "smoke" and "steam," 
We ne'er should rail, but keep in line, 
And make life pass like a 
dream! 
CH0.—Oh I 
my Johnny, exc.

Let some folks talk of foreign life, its pleasures and its joys, 
But continental gaiety to inels all empty noise ! 
And rattling, dashing London, too, is quite thrown in the 
shade, 
By Brighton in the season, there tc walk the GrandPardde, 
CliOlt 
Upon the Grand Parade, upon the Grand Parade, 
The Grand Parade at Brighton throws our West End 
in the shade! 
Upon the Grand Parade, upon the Grand Parade, 
Oh ! such a 
jolly set you meet upon the Grand Parade. 
What can be more delightful, than the charming morning 
walk, 
Such lots of dashing fellows, with lots of funny talk ; 
Such pretty little speeches, though I'm dreadfully afraid 
There are some naughty fibs oft told upon the Graud 
Parade. 
Upon the Grand Parade, &c. 
Now, girls who want a 
sweetheart, that's the place to pick 
and choose, 
There are Dutchmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Turks, Itali-
ans, Greeks, and Jews, 
And nice old English gentlemen, who have a fortune 
m 
ad e, 
And gay young sparks, with none at all, upon the Grand 
Parade. 
Upon the Grand Parade, &c. 
If ever I 
get married, oh ! I 
hope 
To some nice jolly captain. who's 
Then I'll persuade him just to 
maid 
A 
charming villa by the sea, and 
that it will be 
been all his days at sel ; 
stop, and buy his little 
near the Grand Parade. 
Upon the Grand Parade, &c. 
UP TO THE MARK. 
Written and sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
Ain.—" Wait for the Turn of the Tide." 
'Tres -well to be up to the mark, my boys; 
Just look at the days gone by, 
When Washington planted our flag, my boys, 
And raised our bright banner on high ; 
When Jefferson stood by this land of the free, 
And Lafayette too, he fought in the field; 
When first shone our stars in the face of the foe, 
Those stars and those stripes which never did yield. 
CHORUS . 
For these men were up to the mark, my boys, 
They brought sweet sunlioht from the dark, 
They made this great land where we live, my boys, 
And proved themselves up to the mark! 
And they'll find before long the north pole, my boys, 
Or travel that northern sea through; 
Or die at their post like brave hail, my boys, 
Midst the icebergs of cold eighty-two. 
We Yankees, ' tis said, through the world, my boys, 
Do not know the meaning of defeat or fail; 
Our banner shall there be unfurl'd, my boys, 
The future will soon tell of the tale. 
We've men left like Morton and Hayes, my boys, 
One failure but kindles the spark ; 
And brings to the surface them all, my boys, 
These men that are up to the mark. 
Dear Ireland, that's over the seas, my boys, 
Has got a 
bright record to show; 
Since Sarsfield he fought for the cause, my boys, 
And trod down the base Saxon foe. 
O'Connell he struggled with might, my boys, 
Brave Emmett he gave his dear life, 
Their sons will continue the fiolt, my boys, 
Till the shamrock does win in the strife. 
So list to the words of this song, my boys, 
Though now you may seem in the dark, 
A 
good time will come for the Irish, my boys, 
And they'll prove themselves up to the mark. 
I WISH M AMMA WAS HERE.

Sung with immense applause by TONY PASTOR. 
A 
TINY, pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say, 
"Now papa, you kiss me." 
The father pressed his darling child, 
And smoothed his silken hair, 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here !" 
CHORDS. 
I 
wish mamma was here! 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here !" 
A 
tear roiled down the father's cheek, 
He pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh; 
lie bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the fallinrr tear, 
And Willie murmured in his sleep, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here !" 
" 
I 
wish mamma," etc. 
His darling pined that very night, 
Until the turn of tide, 
The angel death was near him then, 
At early dawn he died. 
The father cried in wild despair, 
" 
Oh ! live, my darlinc, dear !" 
And Willie breathed his last fend sigh, 
"I know mamma is here !" 
"I 
wish mamma," etc.

" 
PLEASE GOD, 
MAKE ROOM FOR A LITTLE 
BOY 
!" 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1674, by W HITE and 
GOULLAUD, in the Office of the Libiarian of Congress, Washington, D. 
C. 
These were the last words of " Americus," the well-known child violinist, 
seven years of age, who expired very suddenly during the night ot January 
lOth, 1874, in Boston 
So quietly did his spirit take its flight, that his 
father, who occupied the same room, although hearing hie son make the 
foregoing exclamation, thought the boy was talking in his sleep, and Was 
horrified to find the little child, cold in death, in the morning.

St., Boston, Mass. 
Price 35 cents. 
Written by DEXTER SMITH. Music by SIDNEY GRAVES. 
" 
GOOD night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close, 
And a 
smile came o'er his features radiant with holy joy, 
As if angels came to whisper tidings to our little boy. 
" 
Good night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close. 
(moans. 
" 
Good night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died at, died at twilight's close. 
When night draped her sable curtain, hanging folds upon each 
star, 
Came a 
halo soft and lustrous, streaming o'er the window bar ; 
And we heard our darling murmur, as the bricilitness lit his face, 
" 
Pleas.e God, make me room in Heaven, make your little boy a 
place !" 
" 
Good niaht, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close. 
" 
Good night, father !" etc. 
He was weary of the struggle, discords jarred upon his soul ; 
And his gentle spirit left us, wafted to the heavenly goal ; 
He has room among the angels, he is freed from sin and care; 
God, who wateheth e'en the sparrow, answered little Jitmnie's 
prayer. 
" 
Good night., father !" said our darling, as he sank to sweet re-
pose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close. 
" 
Good night, father !" etc.

My love holds a

STMOLLING ON THE SANDS. 
Of course we all know Ramsgate well, 
That spot to thonslnde dear, 
Where dashing belles and heavy swells, 
Assemble ev'ry year: 
Some like to roam along the Pier, 
And view what that commands, 
But my delight, from morn till night, 
Is strolling on the sands. 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
Watching all the bathers dip, list'ning to the band; 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
In cool or heat there's nought to beat a 
stroll upon the sands. 
I'll ne'er forget last summer-time, 
I 
spent a 
fortnight there, 
And made the sweet acquaintance of 
A lovely lady fair, 
She'd gone to bathe at Dunipton Gap, 
But, oh! the naughty qnean, 
For once she thought she'd do without 
That vile bathing machine. 
She placed her clothes upon the beach, 
Then in the water played, 
But when she tried to come on share. 
Oh ! wasn't she dismayed; 
The tide had turn'd, and all her clothes 
Were flostirw out to sea, 
She'd nothing hut her bathing dress— 
In what a 
plight to be. 
I 
feteh'd her mother to her aid, 
And saved all further stt ife, 
The maiden said, " this gi eat event 
I'll think of all my life." 
We soon became the best of friends 
For all esjoy'd the fun ; 
We're lovers now—and soon we two 
Are going 0 be one.

FUNNY OLD GAL. 
As snag by Everybody. 
I'm a

The people all say that I'm an old fool, 
But they may all laugh and chaff at my pate, 
I'm a 
fuLny old gal from old Ca'lina State. 
CITORUS. 
Then all of you sing for this funny old gal, 
All of you sing for this funny old gal, 
All of you sing and don't you be too late, 
For this funny old gal from South Ca'lina State.1 
T'other day, while walking in the street, 
Some naughty little boy say, " how's your poor feet ?" 
hit him with my cane, and then we had a 
tussle, 
And I 
found all the sawdust coming out of my bustle. 
Then all of you sing, etc. 
Oh! I've been married many a 
time, 
Of husbands I 
have had just nine; 
I 
always done my best for my husbands, don't you see, 
But none of them ever done much for me.

BANNER SONG. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILT-Luta. 
THERE is a 
foreign country proudly resting from its strife, 
That is mighty on the land or on the sea; 
Its sons are true to freedom, to justice and to right, 
And its record is a 
bright one, you'll agree; 
I 
sing of that old country, of the dear old Fatherland, 
That is precious to its sons o'er all the earth ; 
And its memory vill grow dearer when they oft and proudly 
think, 
That to Frederick the Great, their land gave birth. 
Then here's the flag of Germany, 
It waves o'er good and true, 
Long may it float in peace, beside 
The Red, the White and Blue. 
Music—" Die Wacht dem Rhine." 
There is a 
little island that is known unto you all, 
And its banner I'll unfurl unto your gaze ; 
A 
bright and glorious emblem that you'll recognize at once, 
As the banner of its bright and better days ; 
The sunburst and the shamrock shall yet over them prevail, 
In that dear little isle across the sea, 
And no power of might or right shall dare that flag assail, 
For in time that little isle shall be set free. 
Then here's the flag of Ireland, 
And blessed be every fold, 
Her sons shall spread it to the breeze, 
As powerful as of old. 
Music—" The Harp that once through Tara' s 
Hall." 
There is another country that I 
now will sing about, 
And I'm sure you'll co.ncide with what I 
say ; 
She has helped our nation nobly, when she needed help the 
most, 
But her glorious sons have now all passed away ; 
Although beaten in the late war, she will be herself again, 
And show the world how great then she can be ; 
No king or queen shall rule her, no matter what they say, 
For like America she will be free ! 
Then here's the National Standard, 
That now floats over France, 
Her Government is wide awake, 
And keen as any lance. 
Music," Harseillaise Hymn." 
(I) 
BANNER SONG.—Continued. 
There's another little island that is struggling to be free, 
From the tyrants and oppressors who rule there ; 
She's an honor to the New World, and an ornament besides, 
But her troubles, they are more than she can bear ; 
tier oppressors are a 
brutal set who do not recognize 
The law which God has given to us all, 
But murder and cold butchery they deal to every one, 
And that little isle for help does on us call. 
Then here's the flag of Cuba, 
Down trodden though she be, 
But Uncle Sam will soon send aid, 
And give her liberty. 
Music—" Cuba Shall be Free." 
There is a 
foreign country far beyond the rolling sea, 
With its castles and its power on every hand ; 
It has great men in its councils, and of good men not a 
lack, 
And a 
language that we all can understand ; 
She's a great and mighty nation, though her faults we can't 
ignore, 
But the founder of our Union came from there; 
So while we honor her great power and her noble sons of toil, 
Yet we trust our love of justice she will share. 
Then here's the flag of England, 
And while it long shall wave, 
May we ne'er fail to love the land, 
That to us Shakespeare gave, 
Music.—" God Savo the Queeu." 
There is still another country that is dear to every man, 
Who should love his brother ever as he ought; 
It spreads the name of Liberty, where there is human life, 
'Tis the flag that was with blood of heroes bought; 
Her doors are always open to the suffering and oppressed, 
Who may there in peace and plenty speed the right; 
Her defenders are the patriots, who of freedom know the cost, 
For the banner they will ever gladly fight. 
Then here's our National Emblem, 
The Flag that Freedom won, 
And those beneath it dearly love 
The Laud of Washington. 
Music—" 
The Star Spangled Banner.*

BEAUTIFUL GIRLS. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
TEMY talk about their foreign girls, 
How beautiful they are, 
Arai how they dress, and all that thing, 
But for that I 
don't care ; 
The girls I 
love are Yankee girls; 
I 
see them every day ; 
They're plain, I 
own, but then they have 
A 
nice and winning way. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, indeed. 
I 
needn't go out of the United States 
to find— 
CI:WHAM—Beautiful girls, beautiful girls, 
Saucy, teasing, pleasing girls ; 
I 
love one and all both great and small, 
Beautiful, beautiful girls. 
It's nice, when it is winter time, 
To go upon the road 
In a 
nice sleigh, a 
pretty girl 
'Long side of you is stowed; 
And how the people they will look, 
And wonder who she is; 
But you drive on, and never mind, 
Because it's not their " biz." 
SPOKEN.—It's the nicest thing in winter to have a 
pretty girl 
out sleighing. 
You stop at a 
hotel, and ask her what she will 
have to drink. 
She says ( very meekly), " Wine." " What 
kind—port or sherry 1" 
She says, " Champagne." 
Now, im-
agine treating to champagne and only a 
dollar in you pocket— 
and that always happens when you take out riding— 
Beautiful girls, etc. 
And when the summer comes around, 
To pic-nics you do go, 
And to enjoy yourself, while there, 
You ask along your beau. 
The day is fine, the music, too, 
And birds sing from each tree, 
And with a 
charming, nice young girl, 
how happy one must be! 
SPOKEN.—At a 
pic-nic a 
man can always enjoy himself, if he 
has a 
pretty girl with him. 
How nice it is to eat lunch with 
her that she has prepared with her delicate hands! 
How nice 
it is to get into a 
swing with her, and then to wander off in the 
woods alone! 
You (let on your knees, and tell her you will 
love her as long as life lasts, and ask her to be your wife. 
She 
consents. 
You then get up, and find a 
lot of mud and oyster-
shells all over your knees; and all that comes from making 
love to— 
Beautiful girls, etc. 
THE OLD HAT. 
Written and Composed by NED nAMBIGAN. 
Ant.—" Going to Mass last Sunday." 
My name is McNamarra. 
I'm an American cit-i-zan; 
I'm proud you know, 
Wherever I 
go, 
I'm a 
true bore Irishman: 
There's one thing, me boys, I'd have you know, 
And I've come to tell ye that, 
It's the seventeenth of March, 
Whin, as stiff as starch, 
I 
parade with my old hat. 
CHORUS. 
For it's down Broadway I 
march so gay, 
Wid Cornelius, Barney and Pat— 
The people shout whin I 
turn out, 
And parade with my old hat. 
That hat was made in Dublin, 
In the year of ninety-eight; 
'Twas never called in and ye can't begin 
To say it's out of date. 
It's travelled the wide world over, 
From Ireland to Bombay, 
And the only time it can be seen 
Is on St. Patrick's day. 
For it's down, etc. 
Thin give three cheers for the bat I 
wear, 
Before it is too late, 
And nine more cheers for Patrick's day, 
The day we celebrate. 
And when you see me on parade, 
I'll raise me hat to ye, 
I'll invite ye all to come and call, 
And join my company. 
For it's down, etc.

WHERE'S ROSANNA GONE.-[CoNcLuDED.] 
Of her dad I

lie's a 
disagreeable tanner, 
And he's often promised faithful 
He'd dislocate my neck. 
Chorus.-So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen door,

ne'er shall squeedge, (Cze. 
Of an evening after tea, 
While her daddy blew his 'bacea, 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, 
And ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my ! how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden-wall, 
As though I'd just been shot. 
Cho.-I 
shall never kiss my love, (tc. 
I'd jumped over the wall one night 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And though I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad, the tanner, 
Oh I 
my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
Spoken.-At the end of our interview I 
felt convinced that he 
understood what "tanning " 
was, and so did I. 
I 
also concluded 
Cho.-I 
shall never see my love, clzc. 
Some say she's hid away 
By her cruel dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me, 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my clay-cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come, and frighten her dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
Cho.-I 
shall never kiss my love, &o.

IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU FEEL THAT WAY. 
As sung by Gus W
ILLIAMS. 
I SHAN'T forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
CH ORUS , 
I 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The feelinn's so peculiar and funny, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped. her to the ices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
We met again one afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own ; 
She blushed and said, go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
The old man said that we might wed and so he crowned our 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass away, 
I 
long to hear those wedding bells, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt aq tho', etc.

THE SILVER SLIPPER. 
song with Two Posture Dances, a 
Waltzing Chorus and Jig. 
Written by SA1I'L N. 
MITCHELL. 
Composed by H ENRY TUCKER. 
The music of this song is published Wm. A. Polio & Co, 547 Broadway, 
N. Y. Price 40 ceuts. 
THE moon was brightly shining, and a 
million little stars 
Sent down their rays upon her as I 
saw her through the bars ; 
A 
merry crowd had gathered there and dancing was the feature, 
But the fairest flower in that bouquet was that charming little 
creature; 
She was dancing ' neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
can't forget the sweet and lovely pet, (Posture Dance.) 
The neatest ever seen, a 
perfect little queen, (
Posture Dance.) 
For underneath the arbor I 
watched that lively clipper, 
And now my thoughts are centred on her little silver slipper. 
(Dance.) 
Her hair was all in ringlets, and a 
wreath of roses fair 
Breathed out the sweetest fragrance on the calm midsummer air; 
A 
fascinating smile she had, her cheeks of ruby hue, 
And right above a 
Roman nose two eyes of violet blue; 
She was dancing ' neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper. 
Oh, I 
can't forget, etc. 
I 
watched her all the evening, while my poor and wretched heart 
Was longing, vainly longing in that dance to take a 
part; 
The fates they were against me for a 
fence stood just between 
Me and that laughing jolly crowd that between the bars were 
seen; 
She was dancing ' neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper. 
Oh, I 
can't forget, etc.

BONNIE KATIE WAITS FOR ME. 
THE MULLIGAN GUARD. 
By kind permission of ILkitEroA7.1 and HART. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1873, by NED Hennioitc, 
in the °Mee of the Librarian of t 
ongress, at Vw ashington, D. C. 
Composed and sung by IlAitnioAN and HART, with immense success, at the 
Theatre I. 
omique, New York. 
W E 
crave your condescension, 
And we'll tell you what we know 
Of marching in the Mulligan Guards 
From the seventh ward below; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey--
A 
Tipperary man— 
He carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
CHORUS. 
We shouldered guns, 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the Connemarro pet, 
With the rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red, boys, 
To show where we came from ; 
Our guns we'd lift, 
With the right shoulder shift, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We shouldered, etc. 
When we'd get home at night, boys, 
The divil a 
wink we'd sleep ; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of whiskey, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
And march in the Mulligan Guard. 
We shouldered, etc. 
W HERE the lilac buds and blossoms, 
By the tow'ring poplar tree, 
Eyes of loving blue are watching, 
Bonnie Katie waits for me; 
Merry birds among the branches 
Chirp together all the while, 
And the May flow'rs look refreshing 
As my Katie's winning smile.

Where the lilac buds and blossoms, 
By the tow'ring poplar tree, 
Eyes of loving blue are watching, 
Bonnie Katie waits for me. 
'Neath the purple buds rind blossoms, 
Where the scented breezes blow, 
There my pretty Kate is waiting, 
Bonnie Katie, pure as snow; 
Merry birds among the hedges 
Answer one another's call, 
And the squirrels nimbly caper 
On the rugged, winding wall. 
Where the lilac buds, etc. 
Where the lilac buds and blossoms, 
Soon I'll meet thee, Katie, dear, 
For your gentle voice is falling, 
Sweetly falling on my ear; 
Happy birds a-down the meadow,

So I'm comincY, darling, coming,

LET HIM APPLY TO -ALE. 
LADIES' VERSION OF, " LET IIER APPLY TO ME." 
Words and Music by GEORGE W ARE. 
SOME ladies are not happy, 
When a 
husband they have got, 
But wish that they were single, 
And grumble at their lot ; 
I 
really should be happy, 
If a 
husband I 
could get, 
I 
must wait a 
little longer, 
And I 
may be happy yet. 
But there, I'll keep my spirits up, 
And sing a 
cheerful song ; 
I 
can't tell what may happen, 
Mr. Wright may come along, 
And if he only sees me, 
If we can agree, 
If he only has Ten Million Pounds, 
Let him apply to me. 
If the man is handsome, 
If the man is fair, 
If he's tall and winsome, 
Bright and curly hair ; 
If he wants a 
loving wife, 
If we can agree, 
If he has Ten M llion Pounds, 
Let him apply to me. 
(I) 
LET HIM APPLY TO MR—Continued. 
I'll let him have his own way, 
After I've had mine, 
lie might always have a 
latch key, 
To be at home at nine. 
In fact, if he behaved himself, 
I 
perhaps to hint might say, 
George, go and get the brougham 
And see me to the play. 
And, perhaps, if he was very good, 
I'd let him stay a 
bit ; 
While I 
was in the boxes 
lie miffht go in the pit. 
Now gentlemen, here is a 
chance 
You don't meet every day; 
You've only got to raise the funds, 
I'll throw myself away. 
SPOKEN.—That is—. 
If the man is, etc. 
I 
would let him run my errands, 
And take me all about, 
lie always should be mastor, 
The minute I 
went out. 
There, I'll let him keep my mother, 
And my father, too, as well, 
And all our poor relations 
In the house with us could dwell. 
I'd make any fellow happy, 
Only let me have my way, 
To order lots of dresses 
And leave him the bills to pay. 
Now what could be more jolly, 
For a 
husband all his life, 
To see his cash invested 
By me, his darling wife. 
SPOKEN.—That is—

THE VICTIMIZED YOUNG GAL. 
An.—" The vietimizel Young- Man." 
You behold in me a 
victim 
Of disappointed love, 
For I'd a 
beau named Bobby Joe, 
And loved him all above; 
I 
met this brute in a 
blue suit, 
Out there in Chiswick Mall, 
But Bobby he has made of me 
A 
victimized young gal. 
CHORUS. 
My heart will break for Robert's sake, 
Forget him I 
ne'er shall, 
And I 
dance all day just in this way, 
I'm a 
victimized young gal. 
He'd a 
beard so long his sweet chin on, 
his nose took after mine, 
lie was six foot two with eyes so blue, 
And like his smart hat did shine; 
I 
took him out cold goose and stout, 
None knew it in the Mall, 
But now he's gone and left to mourn 
This victimized young gal. 
My heart will break, etc. 
But I 
hope to find a 
ly.,an more kind 
To cheer me in this life, 
And yonder I 
another spy, 
Will take me for his wife ; 
So no more will I 
e'er sob or cry 
'Bout Bobby or the Mail, 
For that young gent he still smiles on 
The poor victimized young gal. 
CHORUS. 
So 110 more I'll quake, but comfort take, 
For be happy yet I 
shall, 
When that young gent he does marry me, 
A 
poor victim youti ,;al

WHILST THE SUN IS SHINING MAKE 701TR 
HAY. 
Now when I 
was a 
little boy, 
I 
used to go to school, 
My schoolmaster instructed me, 
To follow well this rule, 
To always be merry and wise, 
From the right path not to stray, 
But while the sun was shining, 
To always make your hay. 
CHORUS. 
So whilst the sun is shining, 
Always make your hay, 
Nor put off till to-morrow, 
What ought to be done to-day. 
Be always up and doing, boys, 
Remember what I 
say, 
And while the sun is shining, 
Make your hay. 
Supposing you a 
farmer, 
And your debts you wish to pay, 
Your waiting for the harvest, 
And the housing of the bay ; 
You miss the time you should have reaped, 
The sunshine glides away, 
The rain sets in and spoils the crop, 
So think of what I 
s!ly. 
So whilst the sun, etc. 
There's no time like the present, 
If you've anything to do, 
For like the tide, time will not stay 
For neither I 
nor you 
So let industry be your plan, 
No matter where you stray; 
And dwell upon these words of mine, 
And think of what I 
say. 
So whilst the sun, etc. 
SPR ATC TO ME KINDLY. 
SPEAR to me kindly, cheer with your voice, 
Whisper sweet tidings of love unto me, 
Breathe fond affection, words of your choice, 
Dearly I'll linger, yes, linger by thee ; 
Smile on me sweetly, call me thine Own, 
Never treat falsely the heart that is true, 
Gone is the Summer, songsters have flown, 
Dearest, oh dearest, there's none here but you. 
CHORUS. 
Speak to me kindly, whisper to me, 
Breathe fond affection, I'll linger by thee; 
Au ! smile on me sweetly, your heart is so free, 
I'll linger, my darling, I'll linger by thee. 
Speak to me kindly, speak soft and low, 
Nearer and dearer your motto must shine; 
And, too, remember, where'er we go, 
Closely, my darling, your love's bound to mine; 
Think of me truly, day after day, 
Always fight bravely this life's troubled sea, 
And when you wander far, far away, 
Dearest, thy image shall linger by me. 
Speak of me kindly, etc. 
I LOVE, BUT MUST NOT SAY WHO 
I 
THF. bee loves the flower, the wind loves the sea, 
The birds fly in pairs to their nest, 
The lark loves the sky and the robin the tree, 
And the flowers the sunshine love best ! 
All nature is loving ! ab, then, why not I, 
If the heart that's within me is true ? 
! 
perhaps you may know, but ' twill be bye and bye, 
If I 
love—if I 
love, since I 
must not say who! 
The butterfly loves for a 
day, then it dies, 
The primrose the beautful Spring, 
The rose loves the smile of the midsummer skies, 
The nightingale then loves to sing, 
But I, if I 
love, would love all the year 'round, 
And the one that I 
love roust be true, 
I'll own who it is, when my secret he's Ammo, 
Yes, I 
Jove—yes, I 
love, but I 
must not say who! 
LITTLE SUNSHINE. 
CHILD of misfortune, left all alone, 
Nursling of poverty, with no friends or home; 
Cold blows the sleet and rain, freezing my feet, 
Homeless I 
wander, alone in the street. 
My childhood knew a 
happy home, 
And many pleasures then were mine ; 
But now, alas! they are all gone, 
And left alone poor, poor Sunshine. 
CHORUS. 
Child of misfortune, left all alone, 
Nursling of poverty, with no friends or home ; 
Cold blows the sleet and rain, freezing my feet, 
Homeless I 
wander, alone in the street. 
Oh! how I 
dread the night, no place to sleep; 
God in thy mercy, a 
watch o'er me keep. 
Frozen my heart now seems, severed apart, 
Oh ! for one kind word to cheer my poor heart. 
I 
little knew what I 
must bear, 
When mother called me to her bed ; 
She said, " I 
leave you in God's care,' 
And then they told me she was dead. 
Child of misfortune, etc. 
Shunn'd and rejected here, now I 
must roam, 
Child of misfortune, Pm 
left. all alone. 
You who have happy homes, loved ones who wait, 
Pity the homeless, forget not their fate. 
! 
who can tell in what sad hour, 
That bitter fate which now is mine, 
May come to you in all its pow'r, 
And make you sad like poor Sunshine. 
Child of misfortune, etc.

THE WEST POINT CADET. 
- 
'I'm sweet on the seaside to wander 
With the darling who gained your first love, 
Or alone o'er the kind words to ponder, 
As with joy your constancy prove; 
But if pleasure you would be receiving, 
A 
pleasure you ne'er could forget, 
'Tis the greatest of fun, I'm believing, ' 
To waltz with a 
West Point cadet. 
C1101:17s. 
As fondly your waist he is pressing, 
And a 
glance from his bright eye you get, 
You think to yourself what a 
blessing 
To waltz with a 
West Point cadet. 
You see him in fancy preparing 
To march as a 
warrior so brave, 
For his life in the battle not caring, 
That his country's bright banner may wave, 
In glory and triumph above him, 
To route the bold foe he has met, 
,You awake from your dream but to love him, 
That noble young West Point cadet. 
As fondly your waist, etc. 
Some years have passed by since that morning, 
When I 
and that loved one did meet, 
But the memory of it oft is returning, 
flow together our young hearts did beat; 
have oft in the dance trod a 
measure, 
But the night I 
shall never forget, 
It is stored in my mind as a 
treasure, 
That waltz with the West Point cadet. 
As fondly your waist, etc.

While its main design is to instruct the 
reader in the details of commercial comer ponclence, the subject matter of these 
specimen letters embrace all points of interest to the general trader. 
Prominence has been given to banking, and the relationship between bank-
ers and their dealers, inasmuch as hund: eds of thousands o; persons main-
taining accounts of deposit and discount, are in ignorance of the duties of 
bankers and of the the rights and privileges of the dealer. 
To the body of the work has been appended :-
1. A Glossary of the Technicalities of Commerce, or terms employed by mer-
cantile men at hone and abroad, as a 
peculiar and distinctive language not 
familiar to the general reatker. 
2. A table of moneys in which mercantile accounts are kept in various 
foreign countries, information all important to dealers in imported merchan-
dize: and 
3. Several forms of important documents not to be found in a
