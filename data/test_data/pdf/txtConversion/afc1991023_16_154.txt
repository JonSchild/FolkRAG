[This 
report will describe the basic character- of my research on 
cognitive mapping in the Fine Barrens. 
The data is contained 
in 
map and tape recorded form, and this summary will therefore refer 
to documents archived separately by the Library of Congress.] 
JC: Here's one of my favorite roads here... Cause I work 
in this. See I cleared all this cedar out in there. And 
there's 
an underground stream goes right through there 
and 
buy that's deep. 
I had to put a wooden 
plank 
in 
there 
to 
drive over... My house is right down 
through 
here. That's north... 
NR: How did you learn all these roads? 
JC: After so many years? You could be only a quarter of 
a mile 
from 
home and you're out 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
nowhere. 
This 
is 
the 
North 
branch 
of 
the 
Wading 
River.. If you go up, 
there's another opening like this 
on 
the other side of that green cedar there. 
Then way 
up 
on the upper end of that other clearing 
there's 
a 
little dam... Years ago when we used to use that read to 
go up there and get timber, 
that was pretty well -_,pen. 
We had it brushed out, but it's growed since then... 
(Jack Cervetto, October 28, 
1983) 
It 
is 
difficult to know where 
to begin this 
analysis 
of 
cognitive 
mapping in the pine Barrens. 
Much of the research 
in 
the area to date, 
has concerned urban places and people, and has 
asked 
for 
representations 
of 
the 
subjective 
experience 
of 
boundaries 
and 
landmarks 
within 
geographically 
discrete 
neighborhoods. 
Beginning 
with the work of Kevin Lynch (19xx) on 
Boston, Jersey City and Los Angeles, the research asked people to 
produce 
graphic images of the urban-scape. 
While 
the 
research 
provided 
maps 
capable of being classified into five elements 
paths, 
edges, 
landmarks, nodes, and districts - the relationship 
4. 
of 
Lynch's 
maps 
to the subjective experience 
of 
reality 
was 
unclear. 
The topographically complex Pine Barrens presents 
different 
analytic and representational problems however, given the size of 
the land area, 
diversity of informant groups, and the complexity 
of the experiential use of the land. This analysis can only begirt 
the 
process of exploring the cognitive maps of rural 
residents. 
I will continue to wonder how to summarize and confine to paper, 
the 
places 
and 
the 
people 
of 
the 
Pine 
Barrens, 
and 
the 
relationship 
between 
their 
graphic 
images 
and 
real 
world 
experience. 
I have chosen to use a variety of 
techniques 
here 
beside 
traditional mapping, 
in the hopes that triangulation 
of 
methodology 
will be more revealing of the changing relationships 
between Pine Barrens residents and their, environment. Even so, 
as 
much 
as I planned and programmed the mapping 
process, 
much 
of 
what 
I learned came spontaneously and unpredictably, 
in elusive 
ways and rarely where predicted. 
Discoveries 
came 
while 
driving down the 
road 
or 
in 
an 
apparently 
unrelated 
conversation with friends 
about 
hunting, 
local crafts or food. 
It was while exchanging recipes around the 
dining 
room table that their knowledge 
of the 
best local 
bogs 
for picking cranberries became clear. 
It was in an account of the 
silhouette 
of 
local duck decoys that detailed knowledge of 
the 
landscape 
and 
its relationship to prevailing wind 
patterns 
in 
particular bays was revealed. 
It was in conversations independent 
of place and time, 
that their values for and use of the land and 
water around them were shared. 
What 
initially 
appeared to be a simple task 
of 
eliciting 
cognitive 
maps based on their experience, 
turned out to be 
far 
more 
complex than I had expected. 
It was as if my Pine 
Barrens 
friends 
rebelled 
against 
placing 
geographically 
defined, 
graphically 
described 
boundaries 
on their experience 
of 
this 
place. 
It was as if they resisted defining the Pines in 
static, 
easily 
categorized 
terms. 
I often heard comments such 
as, 
"I 
can't 
draw," or "I don't really know the area that well," or 
"I 
don't 
have 
anything that interesting to 
say." 
Initially 
they 
tried to refer me to someone who could tell me more, 
"who really 
knew how it was." But later, they shared what they could with me, 
spending 
many 
hours 
reviewing 
memories 
and 
impressions 
of 
changing 
landscape 
patterns. 
Arid 
while 
they 
didn't 
always 
understand what I wanted, 
they supported my attempts to document 
their past and present - my interest, an indicator 
  
 
 of a new found 
respect for their lives and culture. 
Eventually 
the exercise of cognitive mapping 
took 
several 
forms. 
Some 
maps 
were 
drawn on blueprint base maps 
- of 
the 
• 
region 
as 
a whole, 
and of the informant's own 
and 
contiguous 
U. S. G. S. 
quadrangles. 
Others were impromptu hand drawn maps are 
scrap 
paper, 
of 
the "neighborhood" or of routes we 
had 
taken 
together, 
or of their property lines on township maps. 
But most 
detailed 
were 
the 
narratives, 
of 
places 
remembered 
from 
childhood, 
of 
historical stage routes and inns 
long 
gone, 
of 
retreat 
places and family picnics. 
Some 
narratives accompanied 
field trips to work or play places, 
or to the places where 
they 
grew up or those in which they had raised their children. 
Others 
accompanied 
the mapping process itself, 
while still others came 
while 
looking 
at 
old 
photographs. 
Each 
technique 
elicited 
different 
information and each re-called places and 
experiences 
hitherto 
forgotten. 
Important 
places 
were 
defined 
by 
both 
historical 
significance 
and 
momentary 
purpose 
or 
chance 
occurrence. 
They 
were 
the 
places 
of 
memory, 
of 
personal 
relevance, and of cultural consciousness. 
How could such information be coded? How was I to understand 
its 
meaning in their lives? 
Certainly I could (and 
have 
done) 
counts 
of the coincidence of place names in the accounts or maps 
of different informants. 
I considered 
that the importance of 
a 
place might be gauged at least in part by the number of different 
people who noted its presence - Sim Place was an example cited by 
Bonnie's 
and Malls informants as well as mine. 
But at the other-
end 
of the continuum was a body of place names that 
were 
cited 
only 
by 
individuals and it was these "individual" 
place 
names 
that 
gave 
the "personal color" to the landscape, 
that made 
it 
live 
for 
each resident in ways it didn't necessarily 
live 
for 
other native or long term residents or for outsiders. 
It is this 
• 
dichotomy 
that gives pattern to the analysis of these 
cognitive 
maps 
- both 
graphic and narrative. 
For the Pine Barrens 
is 
a 
place of shared images and individual meaning - "one space, 
many 
places." 
I resolved 
to try to categorize the patterns which 
guided 
the recall, not in quantitative or closed ended terms, but rather 
in terms of implicit relationships with the land, 
for it is 
the 
landscape 
which 
constitutes 
the 
continuum 
along 
which 
the 
divergent patterns of shared image and personal meaning lie. 
The 
continuum 
is their investment in the land and the water. 
It 
is 
the 
bond by which their lives are often patterned - not 
in 
the 
all 
consuming 
sense of the hunter-gatherers as they 
have 
been 
stereotyped, but in terms of an awareness of seasonal rhythms and 
changes, and the intimacy of their interactions with it. 
This is my life right here. 
This is the life I like to 
be around. 
This kind of area, 
especially weather like 
this.. 
That's my life... That's my hobby, when I have a 
chance to get around somewhere. You can ask Pearl. 
I'll 
leave 
and I won't come home til noon. 
"Where have you 
been?" "I don't know." (Jack Cervetto, 10/28/83) 
JS: The people who live out here they like to be alone. 
They like the privacy of it... 
ES: 
Suppose 
we 
have to move. 
Where would 
we 
move? 
There's no place we want to go. 
We're used to this and 
we 
have the woods and we have the animals 
and 
... 
I 
have no desire to go anywhere. (John and Elaine Schuck, 
11/2/83) 
That the land is important to the people of the Pine Barrens 
is 
probably evident to anyone who has spent time there. 
It 
has 
even become a part of the stereotypical images of Pineys, held by 
.those who have never set foot on its sandy soil, or for those who 
see 
the Piney only as one who poaches deer for a living. 
But as 
inaccurate as this image is, 
the pattern of use revealed in 
the 
' 
cognitive 
maps is far more detailed evidence of the significance 
of 
the land to residents than anything those stereotypes led 
to expect. 
Whether the maps were drawn or narrated, by a newcomer, or an 
"old-timer", 
there 
was 
generally 
a different 
sense 
of 
the 
landscape 
than that with 
which I was familiar. 
While 
township 
names 
are 
sprinkled throughout all the maps, 
other 
cues 
and 
points of reference used for orienting included low places in the 
road where there was always standing water (or ice), 
roads whose 
me 
names were marked only in memory, and events long past. The first 
time 
I was 
able 
to hold up my end 
of 
a conversation 
using 
mailboxes, 
the homes of families I had never met, and structures 
destroyed before my arrival in the area, 
as locators, 
 
I knew 
I 
had reached a transition point in my knowledge of the Pines. 
This 
is not to say that all residents of the Pines live off 
the 
land 
or know its vegetational 
patterns, 
but 
rather 
that 
lives 
here are often patterned by the rhythms of the day and the 
seasons, 
which affect the planting, growing and harvesting times 
of 
the pervasive tomato plant; 
by the relationship of sand 
and 
water on the back roads which may be washed out from one visit to 
the next; 
and by the presence or absence of vegetation which may 
shade 
their 
homes or threaten them should a fire begin 
in 
any 
nearby forest area. 
Such considerations may seem remote to 
many 
residents of the contiguous, more developed areas. 
If 
then, 
"Pineys" with generations of history, 
as well as 
some 
of those of shorter association, 
have an understanding 
of 
different 
land 
and water types, 
and the 
vegetation 
they 
can 
• 
support, they also understand the uses of that vegetation and its 
economic potential. 
They know for example, who collects the pine 
cones 
or 
muskrat pelts and the broker who buys them. 
They 
may 
enter the cycle themselves as gatherer, 
broker or buyer, or they 
may 
have 
done so at some other time in their 
lives. 
John 
and 
Elaine 
Schuck 
described their pine coning 
and 
laurel 
picking 
days. 
JS: 
{Re pine coning:] I did it all along the road. You 
had to do it along the roads. You couldn't walk through 
there, 
because 
you couldn't get in off the roads 
too 
far. 
Then you had to worry if you got in too far on 
a 
cloudy day, 
you had to worry about getting lost. There 
was 
nothing 
to get your bearings - within 
a hundred 
feet of the road. We didn't do that much pine. I worked 
in 
the 
woods 
for 25 years. 
I was in 
the 
wholesale 
florist business. 
I sold oak foliage. 
I sold 
laurel. 
Birch. 
Sphagnum moss. There wasn't any birch around. I 
cut 
it 
other 
places... As 
far 
as 
the 
laurel 
is 
concerned, if you cut it 
it does it good... It comes out 
so straight. 
ES: 
We 
could 
take you to places where John 
used 
to 
work, 
and he cut it, 
and there's a beautiful patch of 
laurel there. 
If you go somewhere where it's just been 
growin' for twenty years... 
JS: 
It 
spends itself after- a certain length of 
time. 
(John and Elaine Schuck, 
November 2, 
1983) 
Locals 
may know too, 
where 
land gradations begin and end, 
and where stream courses run. One friend noted that rows of trees 
were left along stream beds because farmers were allowed to clear 
only 
to the wetlands, 
therefore a forest at the edge of a 
farm 
was an indicator of the presence of surface water. Such knowledge 
may save lives in a forest fire, 
when volunteer fire 
department 
tank trucks need to be refilled quickly. 
Locals understand also, 
the 
changes 
that will be wrought on their land 
by 
omnipresent 
.fire, 
seasonal 
differences 
and by the presence or 
absence 
of 
animal 
and human intervention. 
The one time debate over the re-
introduction of black bears to the woods, was not seen as comical 
by 
local 
berry growers for whom bees (and their 
hives) 
are 
a 
necessary 
part 
of 
the 
agricultural 
cycle. 
They 
remained 
unconvinced that the bears would remain hidden in the forests far 
from 
human 
populations. 
Similarly, 
I listened to an 
extended 
conversation in a bar about the expected increase in the 
numbers 
of 
road 
killed 
deer as a new development 
replaced 
a 
feeding 
ground. 
Jack Cervetto came to the Pines from Clifden as a young boy, 
and left for a few years when his family moved back north, but he 
returned as soon as he was old enough to leave home. He has lived 
here for the ensuing fifty plus years, and perhaps no one is more 
eloquent than Jack in describing his adopted homeland. 
JC: 
We have savannah bottom and we have the plains and 
we have the oak bottom and the pine thicket 
... 
plain 
old 
mud...Loomy ground? 
That's oak bottom, 
The 
best 
loomy ground we have, 
that's soil, that's farm soil is 
called loomy. Now this is humus here.. That's only good 
for 
certain 
plants 
because that's 
not 
sweet, 
it's 
sour... That's a peat moss... 
NR: How can you tell the difference? 
JC: 
because 
we don't have any sweet peat moss 
here. 
The only sweet peat moss we have here is oak mulch, and 
that's 
all. 
There's 
a layer about half to 
one 
inch 
thick, that's all solid oak... Oak is sweet, but in pine 
it's sour. Pine is wild. 
It's no good for plants - pine 
needles.... 
The 
type of vegetation gives you the type 
of soil. 
(Jack Cervetto 10/28/83) 
JC: 
We've had a little frost according to some of 
the 
leaves, 
only 
in strips, 
certain areas... It's 
always 
three 
or four degrees colder in low bottom than it 
is 
in high bottom... 
That's a deer, 
big deer, that's two 
tracks in one. 
There used to be a track here and then 
he pushed it over. 
A buck track is split. 
A doe track 
is tight together... (Jack Cervetto 10/28/83) 
The 
sophisticated 
knowledge of, 
and ability to 
read 
the 
landscape 
makes it possible for some long term residents to 
see 
the 
forest, 
sandy 
soil and water 
as 
compass, 
resource, 
and 
• 
recreation, 
and 
to 
see 
the marks of animal and 
man 
on 
the 
vegetation 
and the earth, 
while such marks may be invisible 
to 
the less intimate eye of the outsider. And while the landscape of 
the 
Pine Barrens itself absorbs some markers and is 
scarred 
by 
others, 
local residents read the land as others, residents of a 
more urban context, might read the street. Cues lie in the nature 
of 
the 
soil, 
and 
in 
the type, 
color and 
condition 
of 
the 
vegetation; 
the presence or absence of water, 
and in the speed, 
color and direction of flows of surface water; in the presence of 
paths and roads, 
paved or "sugar sand", 
numbered, named and un-
named; 
in 
the presence or absence of animal tracks or 
"runs"; 
and in patterns of memory - the presence of personal and cultural 
history. 
Landscapes 
of the Pines are filled with 
associations, 
whether 
of 
past or parallel experience. 
Therefore 
images 
are 
often described 
in a temporal context - as a memory, 
a locus of 
current activity or as a goal. 
Places 
live in historical context alongside images 
of 
the 
recent past, present and future. 
It is possible to see in a vista 
both 
the former and current owners of the land, 
and the uses to 
which they put the land. 
It is possible to see a future home for 
a child still in diapers, as well as a piece of real estate which 
when sold will allow its owner to move to Florida or send a child 
to college. 
The woods roads are passages along which ray 
friends 
walked 
both 
in reality and in memory, 
seeing at 
a particular 
tree, 
the 
place where the "school bus" stopped to pick them up, 
,when 
they were the only ones from the neighborhood to go to 
the 
big regional school miles away. 
At the side of a stream, another-
child 
had 
found 
an old brick from an it-or, works 
that 
had 
an 
• 
1800's date on it. 
Only now, someone's house stands on that spot 
and 
the bricks are gone. 
Where a supermarket 
now 
stands, 
one 
friend 
had run his dogs, 
looking for rabbits or the 
occasional 
deer. 
Elsewhere, 
a family's nineteenth century home now stands 
boarded up and crumbling, waiting to be torn down to make way for 
the 
projected re-routing of the highway, 
while one of the 
sons 
restores a still older house a few hundred yards away. 
JC: All right, now see that water we just went through? 
That 
separates 
that island from 
this 
island.... Well 
this 
is 
my 
hangout 
here 
where 
I cut 
my 
cedar 
here 
and 
it's a haven for our 
local 
ducks, 
the 
black duck and the mallard. That's their breeding area. 
The 
best breeding area here for ducks on the east side 
of 
the 
Fine Barrens. 
A wood duck will 
live 
in 
the 
swarnp, 
but 
they breed in the upland. 
They'll nest in 
oak trees in the upland..And in the spring of the year, 
all 
you 
hear 
is ducks cackling in 
here 
with 
their 
young.. 
It's 
all part of the Oswego 
branch, 
or 
the 
north 
branch of the Wading River.. 
flowing toward Sim 
Place towards the Southwest. 
Now I'm 
waiting for this 
thing to freeze up this winter so I can cut that cedar. 
That's why I opened this up. 
NR: Does this island have a name? 
JC: 
No, 
n• 
•, 
but 
it's my island 
 and I'm pretty 
well 
attached to it. 
NR: How long have you had this piece of cedar? 
JC: 
Well, 
I've 
been in charge of this property since 
1'34, and a fellow by the name of Gerber, Tuckerton and 
Mt. Holly had a business in Mt. Holly,_ and in 1949 he 
says to me, he's gettin' old, he says, 
"Jack," he says, 
"you can use that property up there more than I can, 
it 
he said. 
I was taking care of the property for him for 
the moss rights... 
NR: How old is this cedar, Jack? 
JC: 
Oh 
my 
gosh, 
that's over a hundred 
fifty 
years 
old.. land] you know on the bottom, all this bottom here 
is stone as white as milk, gravel, stone, white sand as 
white as chalk or milk... (Jack. Cervetto, 10/28/83) 
It 
is clear then, 
that this land can mean 
many things 
to 
those 
who 
have 
known 
it 
over 
years, 
even 
generations 
of 
experience, 
as well as from new and avid acquaintance. 
Any view 
can elicit complex associations and memories. A place passed on a 
+ 
drive 
down 
a back woods read can elicit knowledge 
of 
aberrant 
climatic 
conditions 
ions 
("I don't 
t ever remember 
seeing 
so 
little 
water 
in 
that 'crik,' as there is 
today."), 
old 
recreational 
patterns 
("I 
used to bring my in-laws here to see 
the 
Eslows, 
when we were courting. 
This is where the fireplace was. She used 
to keep this so highly polished!..), and occupational or economic 
concerns 
("My 
father used to tend those cranberries, 
and 
they 
bloomed beautiful, 
but there wasn 't a berry on them. 
They 
were 
false 
blooms ."). 
That 
view and its associated memory 
is 
then 
reflected 
in 
the 
selection and scale of graphic 
or 
narrative 
i 
mages. 
Cognitive 
maps 
then, 
are 
not only 
records 
of 
physical 
features 
and 
landmarks. 
They 
reflect 
occupational 
and 
recreational 
associations 
with 
the land, 
as 
well 
as 
socio-
cultural experiences. 
It is in fact, virtually impossible to draw 
lines dividing these categories, 
as the experience of the 
land 
is 
multi-purpose, 
multi-sensory, and multi-valent. Residents of 
the 
Pine Barrens have learned to depend on the bogs, 
woods 
and 
rivers 
as supplemental food sources, 
in good times and in lean. 
Their 
hunting 
and 
trapping 
lands 
then 
are 
economic 
and 
recreational resources and if they are members of a gun club, the 
activity becomes clearly social as well. 
Simi larly, 
farmers may 
allow a neighbor- to pick vegetables in exchange for servicing his 
farm 
equiprnent. 
Children 
may 
earn extra income 
packing 
that 
farmer's berries during the summer, and they may ice skate on his 
.defunct bogs or- reservoirs in the winter. 
One blueprint map 
was 
marked with symbols of the old swimming hole, 
the cranberry begs 
and 
blueberry fields where both sides of the family had 
picked, 
the 
school, 
pest 
office, 
church, 
and the "kid's parking 
and 
par-tying place". 
Another was marked with the homes of a variety 
of 
family members, 
the old hunting grounds, 
and the farm 
that 
marked 
the 
limit 
of a childhood range. 
(See the 
maps 
of 
Ed 
Hazelton 
and 
Judy 
Toussaint.) 
In any 
of 
the 
Pine 
Barrens' 
"spaces" 
then, are 
many 
"places," 
which 
are 
physically 
or 
geographically 
defined, 
and 
comprise 
the 
occupational, 
recreational and social contexts in which residents live. 
ES: 
We called it Cranmer Place because there was a man 
that 
lived back there by the name of Crarimer^ who 
took 
care 
of all the bogs and they had five or six families 
living back there. 
It was like a little town. They had 
a store 
and 
they had a packing house 
and 
when 
the 
cranberries 
were ripe, 
everybody in town that 
could, 
used 
to 
scoop 
and came out and 
made 
two 
or 
three 
dollars a day. 
JS: 
They used to scoop 'em. They didn't flood the bogs 
like they do now... 
ES: ... They had a sorting house and the women would sort 
'em. 
That was Christmas money. 
ANd there was a man by 
the 
name 
of 
Henry Ford that lived 
back 
there...and 
Raymond Cranmer, 
Raymond's wife just died a couple 
of 
weeks ago... 
They even had a little post office. 
They 
had 
a place where you put your letters and 
everything 
and 
the school bus that I went to school in was a car. 
They 
took five of us and we always, 
we had to 
go 
in 
there and pick up two kids, and we always picked up the 
mail, 
and 
then we went into Brookville and picked 
up 
another, 
kid and there was a big post office. 
The post 
office was right where the boy scout camp is now... 
JS: I thought Al Royster^ lived there 
ES: 
Well he lived there, 
but that was a post 
office. 
You knew who had it was the Couch family. 
When we went 
to school, the old man, his name was Holloway too, Jack 
Cervettols wife's uncle and he always put bricks in the 
bottom of the car, because we didn't have heaters—Wrap 
'em 
in 
a towel... 
We had high school in Barnegat 
in 
those days. 
I went away to Drexel 
and I graduated and 
I came home and I taught. 
In Barnegat. 
Then when they 
closed the school I went down to Southern. 
They closed 
the 
high 
school 
the year Our daughter was 
in 
sixth 
grade 
and 
she 
was 
the 
first 
class 
to 
go 
to 
SOUthern... We didn't change. I don't think the township 
changed 
from say 900 to a thousand for ten or 
fifteen 
years. 
Somebody 
died 
or 
somebody 
else 
had 
a 
baby... (Elaine and John Sch uck, November B, 
1983 )

In 
these 
maps 
of occupational, 
recreational 
and 
social 
territories 
however,, there are indicators of both 
welcome 
and 
unwe 1 
come changes. 
Memor i 
es, 
the sense of history and emotional 
bonds 
may 
be 
difficult to maintain when the 
character 
of 
a 
neighborhood or, landmark changes dramatically. Anyone who returns 
home 
for 
the 
first 
time 
after an 
extended 
absence 
may 
be 
distressed to find changes in special places. 
One friend 
marked 
his 
b1Uepr^int 
maps 
only 
minimally, 
but 
the 
image 
of 
his 
ancestral 
home 
appeared 
several 
times 
and 
was 
therefore 
apparently significant. 
SS: 
The 
property in this area was owned by the 
Scott 
family 
and my grandmother Crain was a Scott, 
Rebecca 
Scott 
Crain and her family owned the property on 
both 
co=rners 
to 
the 
right and toward 
the 
left 
...The 
property 
up 
here is being developed. 
They have 
made 
changes,but 
this 
was the old entrance into 
where 
my 
great grandfather- was born. 
This area was known as the 
Horner 
place and my great great grandmother was 
given 
this piece of property by her father and she lived in a 
log 
cabin home and had seven children. 
And 
my 
great 
grandfather, 
Isaiah, 
was born in this place, 
the log 
cabin. His grandfather's name was Isaac. They developed 
it and the roads do come in from another direction, but 
I'm not sure exactly of the complete layout. 
1860's is 
when 
this 
property 
was 
given to 
my 
great 
great 
grandmother... Now 
this is all sort of newly laid 
out. 
No it's completely 
different... You'd think they 
would 
have 
named 
it 
[the 
development] 
Horner 
Place 
or-
something after the original name of the area... 
NR: 
Did you spend much time in this area when you were 
growing up.. ? 
SS: 
No we'd come here all the time, because my grandad 
was 
born 
here and this is the place I wanted to 
show 
You, 
the foundation of where he was born, and he often 
came back., 
his memories from back then. He enjoyed it. 
That's 
sort 
of the area we wanted to 
get 
into 
over 
there. 
[The area is blocked off.] I guess it's not that 
important. 
The 
little 
foundation for the chimney 
is 
still there at the end of this little dug out area. No, 
it doesn't matter, but like 
 I said it's been changed so 
much that, 
no we'll go on... 
(Steve Soviczki, October 
10, 
1983)

Steve's 
words 
belied 
his apparent sense of 
loss 
at 
the 
changed name and access to a place of childhood memories. Nor was 
his experience of change unique. 
In reading the transcripts 
and 
listening to the words of my Fine Barrens teachers, 
there was no 
one 
who failed to recognize and mourn over the changes they 
had 
seen 
in 
places 
and life-styles they 
remembered. 
I asked 
Ed 
Hazelton 
how he felt about the changes he had been describing in 
Manahawkin. 
EH: 
I don't like it. 
I like progress. 
It has 
really 
been 
controlled 
progress to a certain 
extent 
around 
here, 
but 
of 
recent years it's really gotten out 
of 
hand. 
It's really gotten out of control. 
You go 
down 
here to the Shop-Rite plaza where I used to rabbit hunt 
and 
shoot quail and run with my dogs and all that kind 
of 
stuff and now it's loaded with cars and people 
and 
strangers. 
You don't know anybody and all that sort of 
thing 
you 
know. 
It's 
altogether 
different. 
It's 
altogether different. 
(Ed Hazelton, 
November 15, 
1983) 
It 
is 
important 
to 
note 
in 
Ed's 
comments 
both 
the 
wistfulness 
and 
the sense that change is a necessary 
part 
of 
living 
in the Pine Barrens. 
Perhaps because the residents 
have 
seen 
the daily and seasonal changes in the land, 
they are 
more 
willing 
to 
see 
the 
land and water in 
a constantly 
shifting 
balance. There is no precedent for stasis in the natural patterns 
around them. And while regret over the loss of special places was 
evident in all interviews, 
there were also often attacks on 
the 
policies of the Pinelands Commission, 
and the perception that it 
was 
attempting to impose a preservationist's framework on 
their-
1 
arid. 
While 
all 
of 
my 
informants 
were 
willing 
to 
accept 
restrictions 
on development in some more narrowly 
defined 
Pine 
Barrens areas, particularly the Plains, there was resentment over, 
• 
the inclusion of land within Pinelands boundaries, 
that was seen 
as 
ecologically dissimilar, and as usurping the traditional right 
to 
manage the land. 
The legislated definition meant 
little 
to 
mast 
of my informants, 
who used a much smaller bourdary for the 
region, 
as 
is 
evident from their, 
maps. 
Like 
the 
legislated 
definition, 
the 
eastern 
boundary 
is 
often, 
but 
not 
always 
considered 
to 
be 
at 
the Garden 
State 
Parkway, 
the 
western 
boundary is generally the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 206, 
and 
the 
northern 
boundary is generally placed around 
Lakehurst 
or 
Whiting. The southern boundary however is both more ambiguous and 
more 
often disputed. 
While most people said they didn't 
really 
know the area further south, 
they put the boundary either at the 
White 
Horse 
Pike or the Mullica River. 
All 
of 
my 
informants 
however, rejected the Pinelands Commission's inclusion of all the 
land to Cape May. 
• 
ES: 
40% 
of our property in Barnegat township 
between 
the wetlands and the Pinelands and the Green Acres 
are 
closed off. 
We don't get any taxes on this. 
The least 
we can do is use it, 
I would think. Because we have to 
pay the 
difference and the State dust bought it up and 
that's 
the end of it. 
Why would they want half of our 
-township? I mean, 
it's not fair.. How much do they have 
to preserve? 
There's millions of acres up 
there. 
Now 
they 
don't have to have millions of acres to preserve. 
There 
must be a hundred by a hundred miles 
up 
there, 
that 
they could preserve in the pristine area which is 
the 
real Pinelands, 
here is not 
the 
Pinelands. 
The 
Pinelands 
is 
what they used to call the 
Plains, 
and 
always 
when 
they 
discussed 
what 
they 
were 
gonna 
do..they were gonna step at 539, because that's the end 
of the Pinelands west of 539... There's some [Pinelands] 
In 
the 
north side of 72. 
It would be up around 70 
I 
think... From 70 over to Whitings and up 70..all the way 
out. 
NR: to 206? 
ES: 
Yeah, that way, 
but even there it's riot Pinelands. 
It's farther south. 
NR: What's the snUthern boundary for you? 
ES: I don't know. New Gretna maybe. 
(Elaine Sch uc k, 
November `, 
1983 ) 
If 
the 
power of the Pinelands Commission in the region 
is 
generally questioned, 
it is because the legislation of boundaries 
is 
indicative 
of its mandate to remove from the 
residents 
the 
power to control the future of their own land, 
land which is 
an 
integral 
part 
of their, identity and lifestyle as we 
have 
seen 
from their narrative and graphic cognitive maps. 
It intrudes not 
only 
on 
their 
sense of "home rule" as we have 
seen 
in 
other 
literature 
on 
the Pine Barrens, 
but on the ways in which 
they 
spend their day, the patterns of recreation and occupation, their 
economic 
resources 
and their sense of place. 
It 
is 
not 
then 
surprising that there should be so much resentment of its role in 
the region. Whether that resentment can be changed to support may 
depend 
on 
the 
manner 
in 
which the 
legislated 
role 
of 
the 
Pinelands 
Ccriirnission is translated into action and 
whether 
the 
residents 
of the Pines can be re-empowered as caretakers in 
its 
management. 
JS: 
There's 
an 
old 
woods road over 
here, 
the 
old 
Halfway Road... 
ES: 
There's a beautiful lake back there. Over in Green 
Acres. 
Beautiful 
reservoir—And 
we used to love 
to 
take 
a picnic basket over there and just 
sit 
because 
the 
deer 
would come in and drink water and 
we 
would 
just go over there 
and have a picnic. 
Make believe we 
were 
fishing 
'Cause 
I don't think 
we 
ever 
caught 
anything. 
JS: They were old cranberry bogs, and they had this big 
reservoir that they used to flood the cranberry bog 
in 
the winter time or when they had a frost... 
ES: 
At 
the time they [the State] bought it we were in 
the gravel business and they were talking about 
making 
places 
where 
the senior, citizens could go boating 
or 
cciuId 
go fishing or maybe just enjoy 
it. 
That's 
how 
they got it through.As soon as they got it through, 
up 
went 
the read blocks, 
big chains and everything. They 
couldn't even fight a fire in there if they had 
to! We 
said 
to them, 
we have a place where we can wash 
your 
sand 
and your stone because in the cranberry bog there 
is beautiful white stone... 
So we said to the man 
who 
was 
in 
charge at the time, 
if YOU would like 
to 
we 
wr-,uld make up a contract 
and we would haul it and wash 
it 
and make some kind of a deal with them and we would 
pay 
them so much for the fill, 
and make 
a 
beautiful 
lake ... 
No way! 
And now there's nothing... 
That's a 
crime.... 
We 
could walk back there. 
There was an old 
road..
