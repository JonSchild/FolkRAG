Bessie T
ones' version of "Little  us,rovs and the Lady Barnard" recorded
 
at San Fernando Valley State Co11e e, November 15, 1962.
 e
essie says she
 
can't remember how the s
on'  begins, but that her mother would remember it.
 
It's also oossible that Bessie would change the text around herself if she
 
had more time to think about It.  The wife figures at the end as the daughter;
 
Bessie claims x%xzU xxx1 that the page, seeing thit Nero (
Sometimes, she says
 
Hero) .
 ett1ng the worst of the fii
,ht, steps in and kills Mi
zz u the
 
Musgrave character, whom she doesn't name.  Nero gives thu page has duaghter
 
in marriage and it all ends happily.
 
If it's the
 
I ain't got
 
Her wedding
 
Her wedding
 
But if it's
 
A rop and a
 
And hanging
 
And hangi n
 
truth you've brought to me
 
but one daughter in the whole round world
 
that you shall be, shall be,
 
that you shall be.
 
a lie you've brought to me
 
gallows and a burying suit
 
that you shall be, shall be,
 
that you shall be.
 
o
 wait I think I hear Hero a-coming
 
I reckon I better go, iii go,
 
I reckon I better go.
 
o
 no, lie still and keen me warm
 
It is nothing but my father's boys
 
In the woods a-blowing up sh.e s, an sheens,
 
In the woods a-blowing up sheeps.
 
Rise up, rise up and out on yo u
r clothes
 
2
t f
ld  fight me for your life
 
I wouldn't have it to say I slaid you naked
 
For laying in the bed with my wife, my wife
 
For laying in the bed with my wife.
 
Oh wait and
 
I ain't got
 
nd you got
 
nd you got
 
give me a
 
even to a
 
a gun and
 
a gun and
 
chance to the door
 
pocket knife
 
a sword, a sword,
 (
Bessie pronounces the "w")
 
a uword.
 
How well do you like my fine feather bed
 
How well do you like my sheet
 
How well do you like my fine little maid
 
That lied in your arms a-sleep, a-sleep
 
That lied in your arms a-sleep.
 
So
 
Mcgki well I like your fine feather bed
 
So well I 11k-ted your sheet
 
rh better I 11k-ted your fine little maid
 
lied in my arms a-sleep, asleep
 
1ed in my arms a-sleeo.

s
ings and surges full and free in the rich main-
stream of Scottish satire, with ten centuries of
 
authority and impetus behind it, vaunting the ethos
 
of our Celtic ancestors, whip-lashing and riving its
 
way through the rock of Scottish history and charac-
ter.  And full from the teeth and tongue of this
 
flood the ethnic soars, proud, joyous and defiant: 
"Fredome is ane nobil thing."
 
In more circuitous idiom the story r
ims like this:
 
In early Celtic society the bards enjoyed enviable
 
power and prestige.  They were respected and feared,
 
because they were able, whenever they felt inclined,
 
to administer the poetic corrective of aoir (
satire).
 
Rather than suffer the humiliation of being  ma de 
"
infamous in the mouths of all men" as a result of
 
bardic ridicule, the haughty and the mighty were
 
ready to go to extraordinary lengths to conciliate
 
the poets and even to buy them off, for they found
 
themselves helpless against the whiplash of satirical
 
invective.  Sometimes even, the poets rounded on each
 
other, and the result was savage flytings (sustained
 
bardic slanging matches) -
 often masterpieces of ex-
travagant grotesque mockery.  Many of the latter are
 
on record, both in Gaelic and in Scots; in Gaelic,
 
for example, the flyting between the rival bardesses
 
of Barra and South Dist, and in Scots the immortal
 
pantagruelian flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy.
 
Parallel with this literary tradition -
 the examples
 
quoted are from cultivated art-poets -
 there is a
 
'
sub-literary' tradition of partisan and often scur-
rilous satirical verse and song, which has enlivened
 
every conflict and controversy in Scottish history.
 
Reformation satires against "the Paip, that Pagan full
 
of Pride"; anti-Calvinistic satires pillorying the
 
Whigs as canting, sleekit hypocrites; Jacobite insults
 
to the Hanoverian monarchs.
 
These traditions, the literary and the sub-literary,
 
cross-fertilised each other through the centuries;
 
they meet in the satirical works of Robert Burns e
.g.
 
his "
You're welcome to despots, Dumourier", "Holy
 
Willie's Prayer", or his savage "Election Ballad"
 
"
---I pray with holy fire:
 
Lord, send a ro u
gh-shod troop o Hell
 
Owre as wad Scotland buy or sell,
 
Tae grind them in the mires"
 
In our own days, Hugh MacDiarmid has dragged Scotland
 
kicking and screaming into a Twentieth Century liter-
ary renaissance, reasserting with all the power of
 
faith, passion and intellectual ferocity, everything
 
that is most mordant in this tradition.  His scathing,
 
implacable denunciations of the English overlordship
 
and of his own people's acceptance of the fake and
 
the false, reach to the heights of the visionary and
 
the prophetic.  MacDiarisid, in fact, in height, depth
 
and sheer mass is practically a culture on his own.
 
It is not surprising, then that the younger poets
 
following in such yeti footsteps should see so
 
clearly the line of advance: a Scottish folk-song
 
renaissance.  The line was so clear in fact that
 
they were able to cover every phase of i
t, from
 
Christmas Day, 1950, when the Stone of Destiny was
 
retrieved from Westminster Abbey, right up to the
 
arrival of Abi Yoyo, in the Holy Loch, March, 1961.
 
Everything was thrown in the pot:
 the missionaries
 
first to give it the bite, army ballads from World
 
War 11, football songs, Orange songs, Fenian songs,
 
Child ballads, street songs, children's songs, bothy
 
ballads, blues, skiffle, Australian bush ballads,
 
calypsos, MacColl and Lomax, Ives and Leadbelly,
 
songs about the Stone of Destiny, Dominic Behan,
 
S.R.A. songs, I.R.A. songs, Guthrie and Houston,
 
pantomime and vaudeville, Billy Graham, Scottish
 
Land League songs, Gaelic songs and mouth-music,
 
Wobbly songs, spirituals, mountaineering and hiking
 
ballads, Elliot and Seeger, mock-precenting, the
 
Royal Family, Roddy MacMillan and Matt McGinn.
 
As a result of this genial eclecticism, we finished
 
up with a banquet:
 
Firstly, as a result of recovery, regrouping, re-
editing and recirculation, a new metropolitan folk-
song corpus was established.
 
Secondly, the Orange-Fenian monopoly in the rebel
 
songs was broken by the emergence of a strong folk-
rebel corpus which subsumed all the best e
lements
 
in the two opposing sectarian traditions: Hampden
 
had taken over from Ibrox and Parkhead.
 
Thirdly, a rich skalrag and immensely popular Glas-
gow street song corpus emerged with dozens of writers
 
to add new verses, new melodies and new material.
 
Fourthly, a structure of ceilidh, concert, soiree,
 
melee, jazz club, folk club and youth hostel took
 
the message to wider and wider circles of young
 
people.
 
Pause for documentation: Ballads of World War II
 
(
ed. Mor); Sangs o the St
one (ed. Berwick); the
 
Rebel's Ceilidh Song Books (ed. Kellock); Scotland
 
Sings, Personal Choice (
ed. MacColl); the Patriot
 
Song Book (
ed. MacDonald); broadsheets (various).
 
Most of these are now collector's pieces.
 
This, then was the folk-scene in the Spring of '
61
 
when the new-style gun-boats came sailing up the
 
Clyde.  The singers and the songs were there to
 
greet them.
 
The singers had sung in club, ceilidh, concert etc.
 
They now added train and station, boat and pier,
 
bus and lorry, road and road-side, march and plat-
form:
 
"
It's in an oot, an up an doon, an on an aff the
 
piers."
 
Acting as an independent unit, they supported demon-
strations called by the D.A. Committee, the C.N.D.
 
Committees, the Glasgow & District Trades Council
 
and the English and Scottish Committees of 100.
 
They became known as the Anti-Polaris Singers and
 
were accepted with pride and affection by demon-
strators and organisers as their own establishment
 
singers.  No one told them what to sing, where to
 
sing, or how to sing it.  They kept to the main theme
 
of anti-Polaris, uniting and binding the many dis-
parate organisations into one body.  And to this body
 
they gave heart, voice and laughter.
 
They were B.B.C'd, S.T.V'd, televised, N.C.B'd,
 
broadcast, telecast, free-lanced and pirated,
 
A.F.N'd, Radio Moscowed, translated, interpreted
 
and given in evidence in court.
 
Dine Done Dollar: Same pattern as We Dinna Want Polaris plus
 
unassilable logic. Key—song in the repertoire.
 
Style: rebel-commercial.
 
I shall not be moved: Work-shopped on one of the early
 
marches.  Many variants, including '
ad lib for the
 
polis' verses.  Theme song of the sit-downers.
 
Style  rebel-anthem.
 
We dinna want Polaris: Sets the pattern for anti-
Polaris song: slogan, repetition, vernacular idiom,
 
local reference, mongrel vitality, skalrag swing.
 
Also sets the pattern for song-making, the '
work-
shop' pattern.  Anyone could add a line, anyone
 
could improve it.  There are eighteen co-authors
 
of the version given.
 
Swept the line at Aldermaston where it picked up
 
many accretions.
 
Style: rebel-direct.
 
The Polis o Argyll: The polis are fascinated by
 
every reference to themselves.  They're not sure
 
whether the singers are singing with them, at them,
 
round them, by them or through them.  They don't
 
know whether they're folk-friends, folk-villains,
 
folk-comedians or folk crowd-scenes.  But they do
 
know that they are accepted as folk-somethings and
 
relax.  They're quite photogenic as they tap out
 
time to the old banjo, and join in the chorus sing-
ing.  Even the Top-Brass (
remembering the sustained
 
'
ad lib for the polis' singing at the first Holy
 
Loch sit-down and the adverse press comment, re-
sulting from their over-zealous handling of the sit-
downers) treat the demonstrators with great cour-
tesy and make special provisions for the singers - 
"subject to the Noise Abatement Act".
 
Style: rebel-comeallye.
 
Paper Hankies:  Catholicity of tune is one of the
 
hall-marks of Glasgow folk-song (
cf.  '
Glesca
 
Eskimos',  '
Rampant Lion' etc.)  '
Yankee Doodle'
 
could not be left out.
 
Style: rebel-direct
 
Ye'll no sit here:  In the list of American exports
 
to Scotland, Yogi Bear has found much happier ac-
ceptance than Polaris -
 or Billy Graham.
 
"Billy booked up the Kelvin Hall.
 
Man, you should have seen his circus.
 
It was bigger, it was better
 
Than the one that comes at Christmas"
 
The song is a great favourite with the polis, when
 
they're doing their folk-friend, leaving the sit-
downers to s
it and with the sit-downers, themselves,
 
reminding them and the polis,  just who's co-operat-
ing with whom.
 
The tune is only faintly '
Hey Jock, ma Cuddy'.  It
 
is much more appreciated, popularly, as '
Ye'll no
 
sh--- here'.  A variant has been collected in Arkan-
sas.
 
Style: rebel-burlesque.
 
Anti-Polaris: A clan jamfrie of Highland Division,
 
international brotherhood, mouth-music and Pres-
byterian psalm-singing.
 
The third tune is known in English as "ho-ro My
 
Nut-brown Maiden" and parodied in the Scottish
 
regiments as "Ah canny see the target".
 
Style: rebel-medley
 
The Misguided Missile: Glasgow music-hall has
 
always been popular in inspiration.  It takes
 
its material directly from the sayings and doings
 
of the citizens themselves. (
cf. Will Fyffe's
 
"
I belang tae Glesca" -
 the city's theme-song).
 
Since Glasgow folk-song takes a large part of its
 
material from the same sources, it's not surpris-
ing that folk and music-hall often overlap.  Note
 
some of the characteristics: the original tune,
 
you think you've heard before; the wayward rhyme
 
scheme, tying the familiar to the new departure;
 
the exaggeration and over-interpretation of the
 
line of argument; the overtones from the English
 
'
90s. (the mock tragic ballad); and from the
 
Hollywood '
20s. and 30s. (
cf. Al Jolson's 'Mammy',
 
the Cantor musicals and the sustained finale exit).
 
"The Yanks are a great people, a great people!
 
They'd do anything for you.  First they send Billy
 
Graham over to tell us where to go.  And now
 
They're s
ending Laning to make sure we get there"
 
- -
-The Half-Past Eight Show.
 
Style: rebel-vaudeville.
 
Camp in the Country: Started as a one-verse frag-
ment, a private theme for the singers themselves.
 
'
Off to the Camp in the Country' meant '
off to the
 
demonstration'.  The tone of glee gives some idea
 
of the cheeky high spirits of the singers.
 
Style: rebel-picnic
 
The Glesca Eski m
os: Goebbels referred to the 8th.
 
Army as '
rats caught in a trap'.  But Mephisto was
 
caught himself.  The epithet became a badge of
 
honour, and the famous Desert Rats chased Nazism
 
out of Africa.  Captain Laming followed in the
 
Doktor's fateful footsteps when he dismissed the
 
Holy Loch demonstrators as '
Eskimos', not realis-
ing that these friendly people had been long es-
conced in Glasgow song:
 
"
Sitting an ng the Eskimos,
 
Playing a gem m
e 0 dominoes,
 
Ma Maw's a millionaire."
 
It's sad that this hoary old sea-dog has been
 
nuzzled.  His every yap was pure gold to the
 
war-chest.
 
The tune is only theoretically '
Marching through
 
Georgia'.  It has long been acclimatised in Glas-
gow as the '
Brigton Billy Boys', an orange song,
 
and half its popularity stems from this fact.
 
Style: rebel-direct.
 
The Freedom Cone-All-Ye: Non-workshop, much richer
 
language.  The Scots has been wedded, after the
 
Gaelic fashion, to the pipe-tune.
 
Style: rebel-bardic.
 
Ban Polaris -
 Hallelujah! This is the granite in
 
the Scottish tradition: no quarter for the Quislings.
 
Contrast this mordant humour with its American
 
counterpart.  This is not s
ickness.  This is Judge-
ment.

The Coronation Coronach: Popularly known as the
 
'
Scottish Breakaway', is the arche type of the
 
folk-rebel song.  The tune, an Orange one:  '
The
 
Sash Me Father Wore", is the arche type rebel tune.
 
The later verges were added as Court Circulars
 
dictated.
 
Style: rebel-direct.
 
N.A.B.: Variations of the same portrait-gallery.
 
More working-class in reference.  The N.A.B. is the
 
National Assistance Board.  Nearly gave rise to a
 
'
cause celebre', when an attempt was made to ban it
 
from the public halls.
 
Style: rebel-burlesque.
 
Never Had it sae Guid: Against the Tories, the
 
English overlordship and the acceptance of false
 
gods (
cf. MacDiarmld's poetry).
 
Style: rebel-direct.
 
Coronation Coronach
 
(Tune: The Sash)
 
Noo Scotland hasnae got a King,
 
An it hasnae got a Queen;
 
For ye cannae hae the second Liz
 
When the first yin's never been.
 
CHORUS: 
Nae Liz the Twa, mae Lilibet the Wan -
-
Nae Liz will ever t
ine!
 
For we'll male oor land republican
 
In a Scottish break-away.
 
Noo her man's cried the Duke o Edinburgh
 
He's wan o yon kilty Greeks.
 
Here, but dinnae blaw my kilts awa,
 
For it's Lizzie wears the breeks.
 
He's a handsome man, an' he looks like Don Juan;
 
He's beloved by the weaker sex.
 
But it disnae really matter a damn,
 
For it's Lizzie signs the cheques.
 
Noo her sister Meg's got a bonny pair o legs,
 
But she didnae want a German or a Greek.
 
Puir auld Peter was her choice, but he didnae
 
suit the boys,
 
So they selt him up the cheek.
 
©
 
Here, but Meg was fly, and
, she beat them by
 
and by
 
Wi Tony Hyphenated-Armstrong.
 
But behind the pomp an play, the question o
 
the day
 
Was, who the hell did Suzy Wong?
 
Sae here's tae the Lion, tae the
 
Lion,
 
And a lang streetch tae its paw.
 
Gie a Hampden roar, and it's oot
 
And ta-ta tae Chairlie's maw.
 
bonny
 Rampant

NAB for Royalty
 
(Tune: The Deil's a w
n wi the Exciseman)
 
There lives a family in the land,
 
The famous Royal crew, man:
 
They willna work, they wilm a want -
-
They're livin on the B'roo, man!
 
CHORUS: 
It's NAB for Royalty,
 
Free milk for wee Prince Andy:
 
Tae pey the cook, an claith the Duke,
 
The Welfare State's gey handy!
 
Wee Chairlie's grannie is gettin on - 
Her age I needna mention -  
For every Friday, bang on time,
 
She draws her Auld Age Pension.
 
When Tony askit for Maggie's haund,
 
They pit him tae the test, man.
 
Queen Lizzie ordered, gie up your job -
-
Be 
 idle like the rest, man!
 
Prince Philip's gotten a brand new caur,
 
Although he's on the dole, man.
 
To walk from here to the Labour Exchange
 
He says he canrsae thole, man.
 
Queen Lizzie has visited mony a land
 
And gazed on mony a sicht, man;
 
But I
'll bet ye a fiver she never has seen
 
A pie on a Friday nicht, man!
 
They Say that we've Never Had it sae Guid
 
(Tune: Kellyburn Braes
 
Alias
 
The Fairmer's Curst Wife)
 
They say that we've never had it see guid
 
Right fol right fol tittie fol day
 
They say that we've never had it sae guid - 
But who in the hell are they tryin tae kid?
 
Wi a right fol dol 
tittie fol dol
 
right fol right fol tittie fol day.
 
They gie the auld folk fifty shillins:
 
Three cheers for Mister Harold Macmillan.
 
We've am got fridges an tellies sae grand
 
God bless the Queen, an the H.P. man!
 
We've aa got rockets an missiles as well -
-
Let's gie them tae Gaitskell, an send hint tae hell!
 
I wish some power the gift wad gie me
 
Tae clap as the Scottish H.P's in Barlinnie.
 
I doot but oor heids are made oot o wuid,
 
Because we've never been had sae guid!

The song Choucoune tells of the sorrow o

arrival.

Yet how sweet was our romance
 
Little birds, oh listen to my tale of woe
 (twice)
 
My love has flown away, the one so sweet and fair
 
She's left me blue and sad, alone in my despair,
 
My love has flown away xi the one so sweet -
ind fair.
 
Oh the chains of my despair.
 
Night jasmine was still in bloom when Choucoune I f
i-est did spy
 
Her smile dispelled my gloom, and I could only sigh
 
How beautiful you are, how beaitufiul you are.
 
But a white man (a stranger) came along and charmed C
',,
oucoune from me
 
How bitter then, my song, for a love that could not bw,
 
Oh how to break her spell, oh how to break her siell.
 
IeL.1O!
 
C
;houcoune was a Marabout with eyes that were soft and bright
 
She was a dream of delight if only she had been true
 
If only she had been true
 
Once we spoke softly together.
 
Birds in the woods, listen to my lament (twice)
 
'
When I think of her, sorrow is my chain
 
Since that evil day I feel only pain
 
'
.
`
O
'hen I think of her,  sorrow is my chain
 
I only feel pain.
 
Beneath the old Carib tree where I met Choucoune today
 
I said our love was meant to be, zkaxgreStmdxmmzw±thaBtzgzitR
 
And I told her of her beauty (reneated)
 
I went to Mama TiJou  a truly fine old woman
 
She took me as if I �
Iere her faithful and only son
 (twice)
 
.
And I drunk and rested there.
 
Then a stranger arrived one day, his hair was of gold so bright
 
His face so fair and light, he stole my Choucoune away
 
He stole my Cgoucone away.
 
Now this sadness is my plight.
 
Now Chouconne is gone nd this is my lament (twice)
 
Best I forget her;  sorrow is a dhain
 
Since that evil day I feel only pain
 
Best I forget her,  sorrow is a chain
 
t
i I only feel nain.

W

Lost my only true love, lost her for ever more
 
Don't oare s

T

Get Old Sack and hitch her t ,  t

Pile the beds and chairs on high, let nothing touch the ground,
 
Sack can pull and we can push, we're bound t

Asked the bank for credit but the man, he turned me down
 
We're going t

We're going t

Bad a job a year ego, had a little home,

dLD SONGS AND SPIRITUALS
 
AS  sung by Loye iiller
 
Foreword by Alice B
. Addiontt
 
"During a long and busy life as a biolocist,
 
n
y uucle, Loyc  illcr,
 
collected songs as a treetrunk gathers moss.  They were sung mostly for himself
 
but at Camp Fires and other small get togethers too, they were pretty sure to
 
come out from the back of his mind.  For many years some of us have tried to
 
capture these songs for a permanent record.  Only now, near the end of his &ls ,,
 
year, have we succeeded in getting a few of them on tape, along with the old
 
guitar which has been in the family even longer than the four score years of
 
his own life."
 
(
Copies of the tapes have been deposited with the music l
ibraries at
 
Ls Angeles and at Berke ey).

Alas, ny love, ye do me wrong
 
To Cast me off d

And I have loved you so long,
 
Delighting
. in your companie.
 
Greencleovos was all my joy,
 
Green sleeves was my delight,
 
Greonsleeves was my heart of gold,
 
And who but my Ladle Greeneleeves.
 
I have been readie at your hazid
 
1ó grant whatever you would crave;
 
I #ave both wa ed life and land,
 
Your love and goodwill for to have.
 
I bought thee kerchera to thy head
 
That were wrought f
ine and gallantly;
 
I kept thee both at boord and bed,
 
Which cost my purse well fs00at1sd
 
favour
 edly.
 
I bought thee peticotes of the best,
 
The cloth so fine as fine might be;
 
I gave thee jewels for thy chest,
 
And all this coat I spent on thee.
 
Thy smock of alike, both faire and white,
 
With gold ombrodered gorgeously,
 
Thy peticote of sendall right,
 
And this I bought thee gladly.
 
Thy girdle of gold so red,
 
with pearlew bedecked sumtuously,
 
The like no other lassies had,
 
And yet thou wouldest not love me.
 
Thy purse, and eke thy gay guilt knives,
 
Thy pincane, gallant to the eie,
 
No better wore the burgess. wives,
 
And yet thou wouldest not love me
 
Thy crimson stocking all of s
ilk,
 
With golde all wrought abowethe knee;
 
Thy pumps, as white as was the milk,
 
And yet thou wouldest not love me.
 
Thy gown was of the grassie green,
 
Thy sleeves of satten hanging by,
 
Which made thee be our harvesy queen,
 
And yet thou wouldest not love me.
 
Thy garters fringed with the golds,
 
and silver aglets hanging by,
 
Whiche made thee blithe for to beholds,
 
And yet thou wouldest not love me.
 
thee I gave,
 
My gayest gelding ±x m uxtkm
 
To r
ide where ever liked thee,
 
Ka ladie ever was so brave,
 
And yet thou wouldost not love me.
 
My men were clothed all in green,
 
And they did ever waits on thee;
 
All this was gallant to be seen,
 
And yet thou wouldest not love me.
 
They not thee up, they took thee down.,
 
They served they with bwnilitle;
 
Thy foots might not once touch t
l.

And yet thou wouldest not love me * 
For everie morning when thou rose,
 
I sent thee dainties, orderly,
 
To oheare thy stomsok from all woes,
 
And yet thou wouldeat not love me.
 
Thou couldest desire no earthly th1ng x
 
but still thou hadat it readily;
 
Thy musicke still to play and sing,
 
And yet thou k wouldest not love me f.
 
And who did pay for all thea gear.,
 
That thou didst spend when pleased thee?
 
Even that I am rejected here,
 
And thou di d*inst to love me,

 wil pray to God on
 
That thou my constancie maist see,
 
And that yet once before I die
 
Thou will vouchsafe to love me.

They hadn't been gone but a very short time, scarcerly  six months to a day,
 
T
ill the black death spread all over the land, and thousands passed away.
 
Martinmas time was drawing nigh .,
 and the nights were clear and cool .,
 
And she dreamed she saw her 3 little babes come running home from school.
 
She spread her table l
ong and wide, with bread and meat and wine,
 
She cried, I
tCome in.,
 my three little babes and eat this food of mine."
 
V
ie cannot eat your food, dear mother, and we cannot drink your wine,
 
The Saviourts coming here tonight.
, with Him  alone we'll dine.
 
Then she went t
o work at the wheel and the loom, & her heart did wildly beat,
 
And the tears she shed for her three little babes, did wet their winding s
heet,
 
Then she made them a
 bed in the back—side—room, put on a silver sheet
 
And over them s
pread a cloth of gold, that they might better sleep.
 
I
fWake up .,
 wake up
,
.," the Saviour cried, "Wake up.
, wake up p" cried he.
 
"Take off your rags.
, put on your robes of immortality."
 
t
'
Goodbye dear mother .,
" said the 3 little babes .,
 until the J
udgment Day,
,
 
"We'll l
eave our bodies on your bed and we will fly away."
 
(musical interlude)
 
N
ext day she went t
o that Northern school, and found her children three,
 
She cried.,
 mIlve c
ome to carry you home .,
 don't mind your grammery.

One e

Down in the meadow the hay to mow;

Straightway for home was his intent,

But none to him did thus rppe r;

God bless the truth that fi ghts  toward the sun.
 
They roll the lies over it and think that it is done.
 
It moves through the ground and reaches for the air
 
And after a while it is growing everywhere,
 
And God bless the grass.
 
God bless the grass that grows through cement.
 
It's green and it's tender and it's easily bent,
 
But after a while it lifts up its head,
 
For the grass is living and the stone is dead,
 
And God bless the grass.
 
God bless the grass that's gentle and low.
 
Its roots they are deep and its will is to grow.
 
And God bless the truth, the friend of the poor,
 
And the wild grass growing at the poor man's door,
 
And God bless the grass.

A PEDDLER'S PACK-Jim Douglas
 
Let me begin by explaining what "A
 
Peddler's P
ack" is all about.  One
 
fairly cotrunon misconception people
 
have about American folk music is
 
that, compared, say to the South-
ern Appalachians, the Northeast
 
has l
ittle to offer  in the way of
 
traditional song.
 Actually, we
 
have many, many fine versions of
 
Child ballads as well as other O
ld
 
World  songs.
 Some  have  been
 
collected  only  in  New England.
 
And we have plenty of native songs
 
our ancestors sang and passed down
 
through the generations.
 Thanks
 
to the work of collectors such as
 
Phillips Barry, Helen Flanders,
 
Fannie Eckst
.orm, and others, we
 
know we have a rich traditional
 
heritage.
 
Each installment of "A P
eddler's
 
Pack"  will  be  devoted  to  some
 
aspect of our region's folk song
 
heritage.
 It may be a song or
 
type of song (sailor's, logger's,
 
farmer's, I
rish, Polish, etc.) the
 
roots  of  our  songs,  singers,
 
collectors and collection5--what-
ever . Given this column's name,
 
and the fact that  this  issue's
 
Regional Review looks at Connec-
ticut--the  "Nutmeg
 State"--it
 
seems appropriate to share some
 
songs about the Yankee peddlers.
 
The n
ickname for Connecticut_-
.tbe
 
"Nutmeg State" does not refer to
 
the  abundance  of  popularity of
 
that spice but rather for tne many
 
peddlers f
rom the state who, it  is
 
said, were in the habit of selling
 
unsuspecting  housewives
 solid
 
blocks of wood carved  into  the
 
shape  of  nutmegs.
 While  such
 
stories may be false, Connecticut
 
peddlers almost surely lived up to
 
their  reputation  as  shrewd  and
 
resourceful entrepreneurs.
 But
 
whether devious or honest, they
 
were  a familiar  and  important
 
figure in early New England.
 
As towns became larger in colonial
 
America they attracted trade and
 
skilled craftsmen.
 But most of
 
the  population  still  lived  on
 
small,  isolated  farms  far  from
 
cities  and  towns,  and  people
 
rarely had the time or means to
 
travel.
 So, with a little oit
. of
 
everything  in  his  backpack  or
 
wagon, peddlers roamed the coun-
tryside supplying the early set-
tiers with much needed manufac-
tured goods.  (Today we value the
 
handmade it s —we expect i
t to oe
 
better made, to last longer, and
 
to be somewhdt unique.  I
n olden
 
days, when most things were hand-
made and easily replaced, i
t
. was

the manufactured  item  that was
 
relatively scarce and expensive.)
 
Here's a song called "The Connec-
ticut Peddler."
 Part of it was
 
collected  and  published  by  the
 
Lomax's in American ballads and
  
Folk  Songs. It  seems  to  have
 
started as a song in the reper-
toire  of  one  of
 the  singing
 
troupes that travelled across New
 
England in the 1
9th century. The
 
Bennington Huseuii, in Bennington,
 
Vermont
., has a folio of songs su n
g
 
by "The B
lind Brothers", J
. W., H
.
 
W
., and Q
. A
. Dunbar. Published in
 
Boston in 1
851 is "The Connecticut
 
Peddler" with words and music by
 
H
. W. Dunbar.  It chronicles some
 
of the items a peddler night be
 
expected to carry.  At one point,
 
a second voice asks, "Have you any
 
s
oden nutmegs?" and a third part
 
echoes
 "Have
 you  any  wooden
 
shad?" I
 
THE CONNECTICUT PEDDLER
 
V 
The main obstacle faced by ped-
dlers like Jolly Old  Roger were
 
the roads, or rather the lack of
 
roads.
 In  fact,  many  of  the
 
highways  and  country  roads  we
 
travel today were 1nitia11y rough-
hewn paths cut out of the wilder-
ness by early peddlers t
rying to
 
get  from one  place  to  another.
 
Most were l
ittle more than small,
 
dirt paths that were bad enough
 
when  dry- but  a
fter  a rain  or
 
Spring thaw were l
ittle more than
 
long, w
inding mud pits.
 
Of all the items a peddler might
 
carry, tinware was the nunber one
 
it e
m sold for over a century and a
 
half.
 I
n 1
738 two I
rish brothers
 
JOLLY OLD ROGER
 
sett el  in East berlin,  Connec-
ticut.  They were skilled in the
 
making  and mending of  tin and,
 
realizing the profits that could
 
be made from t
inware, they set up
 
shop and  began to peddle  their
 
products around the region.  They
 
set an example that was quickly
 
copied and so a new industry was
 
born in A
merica.
 
"Jolly Old R
oger" is about a tin-
smith/peddler.  This song, brought
 
originally from England, travelled
 
across America with the pioneers.
 
It has been collected often and
 
continues to delight young audi-
ences who just love to yell out
 
the last word, "BANG!".

Now Jolly Old Roger had two sets
 
of eyes.
 
Glasses,  called  "specs",  were
 
uncommon in size.
 
His nose, like a strawberry,
 
rosy, and red,
 
Was a snuffer by day and a trumpet
 
in bed.
 
His pipe was a meerschaum of
 
pottery clay.
 
He Smoked it and colored it
 
many a day.
 
Tho' short, black, and stumpy,
 
his teeth held it tight,
 
And he puffed up his business
 
in cans by its light.
 
I 
Now  Roger's  bald  pate  was  as
 
smooth as your nose,
 
And buying his stockings he pur-
chased half hose.
 
He had but one leg and wore but
 
one shoe,
 
And he stumped round his shop on a
 
stiff timber toe.
 
But Jolly Old Roger could not
 
live always;
 
tin-snips of death out his life-
string one day.
 
D
o wn in the graveyard they tumbled
 
him in:
 
Oh, Jolly Old Roger, the
 
mender of tin.
 
One old story tells how a farmer
 
whose house faces the "thorough-
fare" comes out to sit after  a
 
rain and spies a hat in the middle
 
of the road.  As he sits, he sees
 
the  hat move a few inches--but
 
there  is  no  wind  to  move  it.
 
Looking again, he sees i
t move a
 
few more inches down the  road.
 
Curious, he goes over and lifts
 
the hat.
 Underneath  is  a man
 
stuck  up  to  his  chin  in  mud!
 
Offered help, the man in the mud
 
responds with a "Thank you, but
 
no.  My horse and wagon are tra-
velling beneath me and I
'd rather
 
not leave '
em!"
 
At the end of his hard travels a
 
peddler could at least expect a
 
hearty welcome.  There was sure to
 
be a demand for some of his new
 
wares or, if not, he might be able
 
to mend some of the ones he had
 
sold on his previous visit.  Most, 
peddlers were also accomplished
 
menders or  "tinkers".
 If they
 
couldn't sell a family a new clock
 
or cooking utensil they could at
 
least f
ix the old clock or kettle.
 
And finally, along with his goods
 
and services, he also carried newS
 
and gossip which he could exchange

Stars in the chilly night did come and did go.
