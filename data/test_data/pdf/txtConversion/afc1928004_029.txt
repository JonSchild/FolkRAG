For Rosey seemed to like it well; 
My banjo in de river fell, 
Oh, Rose oh Alabama. 
Oh, brown Rosey, &c. 
Like alligator arter prey, 
I 
plunge in, but it float away, 
But all de time it seemed to say,

To hunt dat banjo for an hour,

Says she, Old hoss, don't do dat agin. 
She cotch de wench right by de ear; 
I 
tole de niggers to stan clear,— 
Let dese wenches hab dar way, 
De debil couldn't stop dem on a

De white folks come to stop de muss, 
But de niggars say it made it wuss; 
Dey turn dem right into a

De one did bite and de oder did squeal. 
Den we choke de wenches apart, 
I 
hitch my mule afore de cart; 
I 
laid ole Sally in de straw, 
But de ole mule wouldn't draw. 
I 
laid some hay into de road., 
To coax mYjrnulo to draw de load;
