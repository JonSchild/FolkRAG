Way down upon the Swanee ribber, 
Far, far away, 
Dere's wha my heart is turning ebber, 
Dere's wha de old folks stay. 
All up and down de whole creation, 
Sadly I 
roam; 
Still longing for de old plantation, 
Arid for de old folks at home. 
Chorus. 
All de world am sad and dreary, 
Ebry where I 
roam; 
Oh! darkeys, how my heart grows weary, 
Far from de old folks at home. 
All round de little farm I 
wandered, 
When I 
was young; 
Den many happy days I 
squandered, 
Many de songs I 
sung. 
When I 
was playing wid my brudder, 
Happy was I; 
Oh! take me to my kind old mudder, 
Dere let me live and die. 
Chorus. 
All de world am sad and dreary, &c. 
(7) 
S 
CHRISTI,, S 
One little hut among de bushes, 
One dat I 
love, 
Still sadly to my memory rushes, 
No matter where I 
rove. 
When will I 
see de bees a 
humming, 
All round de comb? 
When will I 
hear de banjo tumming, 
Down in my good old home? 
Chorus. 
All de world ant sad and dreary, &c.

Oh! carry me ' long; 
Der's no more trouble for me: 
I's guine to roam 
In a 
happy home, 
Where all de niggas am free. 
I've worked long in de fields — 
I've handled many a 
hoe; 
I'll turn my eye, 
Before I 
die, 
And see de sugar-cane grow. 
Chorus. 
Oh! boys, carry me ' long; 
Carry me till I 
die: 
Carry me down 
To de buryin' groun'. 
Massa, don't you cry. 
All ober de land 
I've wander'd many a 
day, 
PLANTATION MELODIES. 
To blow de horn 
And mind de corn, 
And keep de possum away. 
No use for me now — 
So, darkeys, bury me low: 
My horn is dry, 
And I 
must lie 
Wha de possum nebber can go. 
Chorus. 
Oh! boys, carry me ' long, &c. 
Farewell to de boys, 
Wid hearts so happy and light; 
Dey sing a 
song 
De whole day long, 
And dance de juba at night. 
Farewell to de fields 
Of cotton, ' bacco, and all: 
I'se guine to hoe 
In a 
bressed row, 
Wha de corn grows mellow and tall. 
Chorus. 
Oh! boys, carry me ' long, &c 
Farewell to de hills, 
De meadows covered wid green, 
Old brindle boss 
And de old grey hoss — 
All beaten, broken, and lean. 
Farewell to de dog 
Dat always followed me round; 
Old Sancholl wail 
And droop his tail, 
When I 
am under de ground. 
Chorus. 
Oh! boys, carry me ' long, &c.

And der's corn and punkins plenty, lub, a

Oh! dadda, D' D' Dolcy Jones!

PLANTATION MELODIES. 
De Days when I was Young. 
As sung by Christy's Band of Minstrels. 
I'm getting old and feeble now; 
Dis hair am turnin grey; 
I 
cannot work, as once I 
did, 
Upon each sunny day. 
De corn I 
used in pride to hoe— 
I 
planted it myself— 
Some younger nigga now must raise, 
For I'm laid on de shelf. 
Chorus. 
Den gadder round ye darkey crew— 
The tale I 
oft have sung 
I'll sing again—again to you, 
Ob days when I 
was young. 
De morn ob life was full ob joy; 
I 
climb'd de ole gum-tree, 
Or listen'd to de oft-told tales, 
Beside my mudder's knee. 
I 
chased de coon; I 
poled de raft; 
De possum was my prize— 
A smile den wreathed my fader's lips, 
Dough tears war in his eyes. 
Chorus. 
Den gadder round, & c. 
I 
loved a 
coloed gal, and she 
Was bound to me tro' life; 
And round my fire were gadder'd soon 
My children and my wife. 
But Def, alas! come dar, and took 
De ones I 
lub de best; 
And leff no tie to comfort me, 
Or calm my aching breast. 
Chorus. 
Den gadder round, &c.

CHRISTY'S 
Now years have past—my youth am gone; 
My eyes are bathed in tears, 
And nuffin's left dis nig on earth, 
But memory of past years. 
Old massa promised inc to-day, 
Dat when I 
fail'd, and died, 
He'd lay me, wife, and little ones. 
In one grave, side by side. 
Chorus. 
Den gadder round, ye darkey crew, 
De tale I 
oft have sung 
No more will meet your list'ning ears, 
Of days when I 
was young. 
Greeting to a Merry Hey—Not Jenny Lin&s. 
As sung by Christy's Band of Minstrels. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! 
Let's sing, to a 
merry key, 
Of the banner that waves aloft 
O'er the home of the brave and free. 
The darkey may sing at his work, 
Or dance at de close ob de day; 
Wid de fiddle or banjo and bones, 
Drive every sharp sorrow away. 
He may lay in de shade ob de trees, 
And snooze, and be dreamin ob bliss. 
Den talk not ob far distant lands, 
For none can be equal to dis. 
Chorus. 
Hurrah, &c. 
De stars dat shine ober our heads 
Are transposed to our banner so bright, 
And diffuse o'er our broad happy land 
Their purest and steadiest light; 
And under their influence meet 
De buckra and darkey so gay; 
And when our tunes fall on your ears. 
Your care is all driven away. 
Chorus. 
Hurrah, &c. 
There is room for all who will come; 
The alien can here rest in peace; 
And the one who has suffer'd the most, 
Will find all his sufferings cease. 
And talent and virtue may come, 
Borne here by the favouring sails, 
And listen, as oft as they please, 
To this great band ob dark nightingales. 
Chorus. 
Hurrah, &c. 
Old Aunty Brown. 
As sung by Christy's Band of Minstrels. 
Old aunty Brown is feeble now, 
Her hair is thin and grey, 
It wanders o'er her wrinkled brow, 
And there she lets it lay; 
She cannot knit, she cannot read, 
Nor dare she ever sew,— 
Yet she could do them, oh I 
how well, 
Some fifty years ago. 
Her husband, he is dead and still; 
Yet he was very old; 
Before he died he made his will, 
And left her all his gold. 
She has no son to break her heart, 
Nor daughter vain to feed, 
20 
CHRISTY'S 
Yet one by one her days depart, 
Unknown vi care or need. 
The paint is all worn off the chair 
That she has had so long; 
She bought it at an orphan's fair, 
When she was young and strong. 
She used to think the most of it,— 
That good old chair of yore: 
In it she sewed— in it she knit, 
And read her Bible o'er. 
Medley Song. 
As sung by Christy's Band of Minstrels. 
As a 
sensitive coon lay sleeping one day, 
The sound of a 
wood-cutter's hatchet he heard; 
So he jumped on a 
stump, to see what was to pay, 
And thus did he sing,— aye, he sung like a 
bird,— 
Woodman, spare that tree! 
Touch not a 
single bough, 
In youth it sheltered me, 
And I'll stick to it now. 
Hard by, in a 
pine, sat a 
sober old owl, 
A fanning himself by the cold western breezes 
And he wore on his features a 
horrible scowl, 
As he sung to the zephyrs that swept through the 
treeses: 
Blow! 0 blow! ye gentle breezes, 
All among the flowers and treezes, 
Till you give my blood the freezes. 
A skunk and a 'possum then met, 
And they shook hands and kissed, and most 
lovingly clung, 
PLANTATION MELODIES. 
21 
For they'd vowed years ago that they ne'er won' 
forget 
One another through life; so they struck up an 
sung — 
Should auld acquaintance be forgot, 
And never brought to mind? 
Should auld acquaintance be forgot 
In the days o' auld lang syne ? 
A fox leaped out of a 
thicket and played 
With his brush for awhile, in a 
transport of gl 
Then thoughtfully walked to a 
green forest glade 
When he sat himself down, and most swe,. 
sang he— 
Oft in the stilly night, 
Ere slumber's chains have bound me, 
Fond memory brings a 
sight 
Of nice fat geese around me. 
The fox, skunk and 'possum, the owl and the coon. 
In concert all joined to the tune of " Mool Brook-. 
The stars cried " encore !" and the bright silver mo, 
Grew brighter and brighter, as they sung with°. 
books — 
We'll not go home till morning, 
We'll not go home till morning, 
We'll not go home till morning, 
Till daylight cloth appear. 
De last ob de Cabbages. 
As sung by Christy's Band of Minstrels. 
'Tis de last ob de cabbages, 
Left standin' alone; 
Every bean-bush and ' tater-vine 
Am faded and gone. 
22 
CHRISTY'S 
Not a 
collard is standin', 
Each squash-vine am fell, 
Nor reflect her soft blushes, 
Nor give smell for smell ! 
I'll not leave thee, lone cabbage, 
To die on the stem, 
Since I've eat all the others, 
I'll do you like dem: 
So kindly I 
pull off 
The leaves from the stalk, 
Since your mates ob de garden 
Am now sterns, white like chalk! 
So quick may I 
follow, 
If Dinah should die! 
And her eyes shut forebber, 
How dis poor darkey 'd 
cry! 
When banjos am broken, 
And collards all gone, 
Oh! who den would lib in 
Dis black world alone? 
Julius from Kentucky. 
As sung by Christy's Band of Minstrels. 
Come listen to me, while I 
sing' 
To you my little ditty, 
Of what this darkey did to bring 
Himself into your city. 
And glad am I 
now to appear, 
And deem the 'casion lucky, 
For 'tis not often that you hear 
This Julius from Kentucky. 
PLANTATION MELODIES. 
Chorus. 
Oh! Kentucky—it is the land for me, 
And surely I'll go there again, 
When colored men are free. 
'Twas there I 
used the hoe and spade 
To raise the corn and beans; 
Bacon and ' bacco too we made, 
To go to New Orleans. 
And master took me to the boat, 
A chance to me so lucky, 
For on the river all must tote 
Their plunder from Kentucky. 
Chorus. 
Oh! Kentucky, &c. 
23 
In New Orleans they shut me in,. 
With hundred more they say, 
Some black, some white, some large, some thin, 
To sell 'em all next day. 
I 
climb the barrel—jump the gate, 
And s'scape the guard so lucky; 
I 
go from there to New York State, 
And master to Kentucky. 
Chorus. 
Oh! Kentucky, &c. 
I'm sorry now for master's loss, 
And none could feel it greater, 
For master he was half a 
horse, 
And half an alligator. 
And now I 
join the Christy band, 
The first, and the most lucky 
Of all the darkies in the land, 
From Orleans or Kentucky. 
Chorus. 
Oh! Kentucky, &c.

Her eyes were bright as diamonds, her teeth were

Chorus. 
But now she is far, far away, 
And I

But if she was here, 
She'd have nothing to fear, 
For the darkies all love her so gay. 
The darkey traders came one day and buy my gal 
from me, 
And left me all alone to mourn beneath the cypress

It fill'd my heart wid grief and pain to think she 
had ,to go; 
Still I 
live in hopes to meet again my charming Jane

Oh! once I 
loved a 
yellow gal, 
I 
loved her as my life; 
She came from old Virginia, ' 
And I 
took her for my wife: 
We happy lived together, 
She never caused me pain; 
But on one cold and stormy night 
I 
lost my Mary Blane. 
Chorus. 
Farewell! farewell! poor Mary Blane; 
One faithful heart still thinks of you. 
Farewell! farewell! poor Mary Blane, 
Tho' we ne'er shall meet again. 
I've nothing left to live for now, 
I'm weary of my life; 
Then take and lay me gently by 
My poor heart-broken wife. 
I 
wander sadly through the world, 
But find my sorrow's vain; 
These tears can never bring to me 
My darling Mary Blane. 
Chorus. 
Farewell! farewell! poor Mary Blane, &c. 
I 
buried her at dead of night, 
'Neath the persimmon tree; 
De snow was falling thick and white 
On her dear grave and me, 
And often since in dreams I 
see 
Her well-known form again, 
As when I 
laid her in de grave, 
And wept o'er Mary Blane.

As sung by Christy's Band of Minstrels. 
There formerly might have been seen an aged colored 
individual, 
Whose cognomen was uncle Edward; 
He departed this life some time since, some time

And he had no capillary substance on the summit of 
his cranium, 
On the place designed by nature for the capillary to 
vegetate. 
Chorus. 
Then lay down the agricultural implements, 
Allow the violin and the bow to be pendent on the 
wall,— 
For there is no more physical energy to be displayed 
By indigent aged Edward; 
For he has departed to the abode designated by a 
kind Providence for all pious, humane, and 
benevolent colored individuals.

Uncle Edward had digits equal in longitude to the 
Bamboo formation which springs so spontaneously on 
the bank of the southern Mississippi, 
And he had no oculars with which to observe 
The beauties of nature; 
And lie had no dental formations with which to 
Masticate the Indian meal cake, 
Consequently he was forced to permit the 
Indian meal cake to pass by with impunity. 
Chorus. 
Then lay down, &c. 
When uncle Ned relinquished his hold on vitality, 
His master was exceedingly grieved, 
And the lachrymal poured down his cheeks similar 
to the rain from heaven, 
For lie knew that the old man was laid beneath 
terra firma, terra firma. 
lie would never have the pleasure of beholding the 
physiognomy of the aged Edward any more.

Was by the lonely haunted well.

As the darkey lay all night that day down by the

A girl was dar, she stood on air, her features were 
so mild ; 
She took a

But fare thee well, sweet Katy, 
Thou'rt gone, forebber gone!

All sadly and alone.

CHRISTY'S 
She Sleeps in the Grave. 
Words used by permission of G. P. Reed & Co., publishers of 
the music, Boston. 
How oft have you asked why I 
never am gay! 
Why my forehead is wrinkled, my hair has turned 
gray; 
Why the friends of my heart, and the tried ones of 
years, 
Have ne'er seen me smile, but oft found me in tears; 
Why I 
fly from your sports, and your pastimes pass by, 
And why from my bosom I 
oft heave a 
sigh! 
But listen, my friends, ' tis the last time I'll have 
To tell of the dear one who sleeps in the grave! 
Chorus. 
She sleeps in the grave! she sleeps in the 
grave! 
Where the sweet flowers grow and the tall 
willows wave; 
And the moon when she sails in the hea-
vens above, 
Looks sadly and cold on the tomb of my 
love! 
Yes, alas! oh, alas! she has gone, she has gone! 
I 
have none to love now! I'm alone, all alone! 
She was sick, and my heart said with many a 
sigh, 
That Dinah, the wife of my bosom, must die! 
How my heart beateth now, as her last words I 
tell: 
She kissed me and said —" Fare thee well! 0! 
farewell!" 
When the bright sun had sunk to his home in the 
west, 
My Dinah, my darling, lay dead on my breast. 
Chorus. 
And she sleeps in the grave! &c.

Oh! come, my lovely Dinah, 
Come, hasten, love, to me; 
The moon shines bright and beautiful, 
Across the rippling sea. 
I 
love you as the stars of night, 
That shine in heaven above. 
Then come away with me this night, 
My best, my only love. 
Chorus. 
Then come away, my Dinah, dear, 
Oh! come away with me; 
For all the world is fast asleep, 
And the moon shines o'er the sea. 
Oh! Dina, dear, you know for years 
I 
loved you long and well, 
And now I've come this very night, 
My love for you to tell ;— 
And if you do not say this night 
You love this darkey swain, 
I'll throw myself into the sea, 
And I'll ne'er come back again.

Oh! I 
hab been from norf to souf, 
And darkey gals I've seen; 
But none did eber seem to me 
So sweet as Julia Green! 
She dances and she skips about, 
And cuts tie pigeon wing; 
And, oh! it seems such melody, 
When she begins to sing! 
Chorus. 
Oh! I 
hab been from norf to souf, 
And darkey gals I've seen; 
But none did eber seem to me

Go sliding down the sky; 
And ebery little twinkling star 
Seem'd Julia's shinin' eye.

Negro's Seven Ages — Not Shakspeare/s. 
As recited by Christy's Band of Minstrels 
First de picaninny what's squallin in de lap, 
Because its nigger mammy wont gib it any pap; 
De way he kicks and hollers is a 
sin to human natur, 
Till de nurse does stop his mouf wid a 
great big roast 
potater. 
And den de rascal's sent to school wid dinner in his 
basket, 
Which ob course he eats in no time, afore he does 
his task get; 
And arter school is ober, he gets fightin wid de boys, 
70 
CHRISTY'S 
And runs home, wid his eyes both black, a 
kickin 
up a 
noise. 
Den de willin falls in lub, and courts Miss Dinah 
Slue. 
He raves and swears and tears his hair, and jump 
about Jim Crow, 
'Till his daddy punches well his head, jist like a 
piece ob wood; 
Den he's cured ob dat, which, you must own, does 
him a 
deal ob good. 
He can't go for a 
soger—cos his colour, it is black; 
So he looks for work, and arterwards he tinks he'll 
drive a 
hack; 
But de horses run away and gib him lots ob trouble; 
And den wid him, oh, sad to tell! busts reputation's 
bubble. 
He can't be justice neider, as Massa Shakspeare says, 
Cos a 
nigger's judgment wont go down wid de public 
now-a-days; 
But he raises his mouse-catchers, and goes cook on 
board a 
ship; 
But de biter busts, and he escapes, afore he went 
fust trip. 
Now de darkey 's 
gettin old—good gracious, what ' 11 
he do? 
His head is coming from his hat, his toes press from 
his shoe; 
So he gets some blackin and a 
brush, and sets down 
on de walk, 
To black de boots; but Star's come on, and make 
him walk his chalk. 
Den he gets so old dat he can't see— his wool is all 
gray, 
And de white folks turn dere noses up, and push 
him out de way, 
'Till he crawls into some cellar, in de neighborhood 
close by, 
Looks about for a 
soft piece ob board, and lays him 
down to die. 
TATION MELODIES. 
By de Seben Ages ob de Nigger, white folks, you 
plainly see 
How de nigger 's 
used by all de world, when a 
little 
up de tree. 
" 
He'd no business to be nigger," ob course, you all 
will say; 
But some poor folks must niggers be, or white trash 
rules de day.
