Carry the News to Mary. 
Arii'ide at Hinitis's, New York. 
0, MARTHA wept and Mary cried, 
We'ie all surrounded; 
The good old man has gone and died, 
We're all surrounded. 
Shake off your slumbers and arise, 
We're all surrounded; 
The sun is shining in the skies, 
We're all surrounded. 
Then carry the news, 
Carry the news to Mary, 
Carry the news, 
We're all surrounded. 
The good old man we'll seo no more„ 
We're all surrounded; 
He has gong to the happy shoro, 
We're all surrounded. 
He's gone and left us darks alor.e, 
We're all surrounded ; 
And Gabriel's trumpet called him home, 
We're all surrounded. 
Adam and eve cliniebd up a 
tree,' 
We're all surrounded; 
Their lamb and -master for to see, 
We're all surrounded. 
Eve stole an apple from the tree, 
We're all surrounde;I; 
And Adam was stung by a 
bumble bee, 
We're all surrounded. 
SOLDIER TALK. 
ONE very fanny habit, since our cruel war is done,' 
And as welcome as the devil, to each and every one. 
Whatever now may happen, even in our daily walk, 
We find our soldier people full of military talk. 
CHORUS: 
Soldier talk, soldier talk, it now is all the rage, 
In every conversation, on every written page; 
And it is the truth, both young and old, you may go near or far, 
The people all have soldier talk, contracted in the war. 
Miss Dinah Snow is married to a 
dashing Soldier fine, 
She says, in hanging out the clothes, she's going to " dress the 
line," 
And when she goes to fix her hair, with military tunes, 
She combs her wool in " regiments," then turns it in " platoons." 
Soldier talk, &c. 
If you 7o to set a 
table, you must set the plates in " rank," 
The spoons in front as " skirmishers," the knives and forks 
upon the " flank ; ' 
You call the ham the " colors," for the men to " rally round," 
And you tell the folks to " fall in," and bravely " hold their 
ground," 
Soldier talk, &c. 
The women too, how quickly new habits now contract, 
You'll see them every day wearing " cascades " on their back, 
And when they go to cross a 
gutter (you'll think I'm rude, I 
fear), 
Especially if it's muddy, why, it's " close up in the rear." 
Soldier talk, &e, 
But as this life is ended, fast as I 
close the rhyme, 
The doctors at the " surgeon's call," the lawyers " marking 
time," 
And there's the " chaplain," with the " troops," he'll tell you 
what to do 
To miss old Nick's " roll-cull" and shirk the last " tattoo. 
6oldier talk, & c.

FATE OF A 
FIGHTING DORG, 
A MAN he owned a 
terrier dorg, 
A 
bob-tailed ornery cuss, 
And that there purp got that there ma; 
In many an ugly muss. 
For the man he was on his muscle, 
And the dorg was on his bite, 
So to kick that dog-goned animile, 
Was sure to raise a 
fight. 
A woman owned a 
Thomas eat, 
That fit at fifteen pound, 
And other cats got up and slid 
When that there cat was round. 
The man and his dorg came along one any, 
Where that woman her home had, 
And the purp he growled ferociously, 
Then went for the cat like mad. 
He tried to chaw the neck of the cat, 
But the cat he wouldn't be chawed, 
So he lit on the back of thatjhere dorg, 
And bit, and clawed, and be clawed ; 
Oh the hair it flew and the purp he yowled, 
As the claws went into his hide, 
And chunks of flesh were peeled from his back, 
Then he flummoxed and kicked and died. 
The man he ripped and cussed, and swore, 
As he g ' 40. brick-bat, 
would be darned essentially, 
he didn't kik that cat. 
But the woman allowed she'd be blessed if he did, 
And snatched up an old pop-gun, 
Which she fired and peppered his diaphragm 
With bird shot number one 
They toted him home on a 
window blind, 
And the doctor cured him up, 
But be never was known to fight again, 
Or to own another purp. 
Folks may turn up their snoots at this here rhyrno, 
I 
don't care a 
fig for that, 
All I 
want to show is that fighting dorgs, 
May tackle the wrong tom cat.

COURAGE. NERVE AND PLUCK 
IF in the strugglevof this life, 
The rapid race you'd run, 
To gain both fame and honor; or 
To see a 
little fun. 
Trust not to faithless fortune, 
The gambler's goddess luck, 
But trust the sturdy watchword 
Of courage, nerve and pluck. 
If in the race you chance to fall, 
Don't pause to rest or cry, 
Or ask unhappy fortune then, 
The cause or reason why. 
But up again and at it quick, 
And boldly run the muck, 
For trust me friend, they always win, 
Do courage, nerve and pluck. 
Then let-your spirits never sink, 
No matter what you do, 
Although amid misfortunes drear, 
You sometimes shold feel blue. 
You yet may be our President, 
Grant from the rolls be struck, 
For yet, in spite of race-course cads, 
We've courage, nerve and pluck.

HIGH HEEL SHOES. 
AS I 
was walking along the street, a 
pretty girl I 
chanced to 
meet, — 
Whose looks were mild and calm, 
She winked at me her eye, and then she look..d so shy, 
And said, how are you, mister Saucy Sam. 
To a 
saloon then we did walk, we had a 
chat and talk. 
And I 
called for an oyster stew, 
Said I 
your name, my dear, when she spoke so very queer, 
Said I 
Am Sallie with the high- heeled shoes. 
Go away, my yeller gal, 
Catch me you never shall, 
I 
haTen't any money for to lose, 
Besides you're not the figure 
For to fascinate this nigger, 
With the little old high-heeled shoes. 
The truth to you I'll tell, I 
feel in love with this young gal. 
Which love caused me great pain. 
To kiss her I 
did try, when she banged me in the eye, 
J 
Said never try td do that again. 
I 
tell you I 
kind of wilted, when I 
found that I'd been jilted, 
She said .' 
hoped that her I 
would excuse, 
She said next time take it cool, anoinever try again to fool, 
A 
little gal with the high-heeled shoes. 
Go away, &c. 
A 
friend's advice I 
offer you, never take an oyster stew, 
With any little gal you chance to meet, 
Never take the arm, or 'twill surely come to harm, 
When too late you will find that you are beat. 
Be sure you've won her heart, and that before you part, 
For the girls ftre as cunning as Jews, 
And if you ask for them to marry, they will tell you to tarry i 
Wig the little gal in high-liee4d 
ci-Q Away, &a, 
Winking at Me. 
11,071T pf money's the root of all evil they say, 
A 
-.1 
the intrigues to get it's the curse of the day, 
Fc1.11011, now-a- days, soon get richer than kings, 
EJ 
means of their dishonest corners and rings, 
Corners 'and rings, corners and rings, 
ixteans of their dishonest corners and rings. 
Now Wall street is full of such intrigues and snares, 
Some made by the bulls and some made by the bears, 
And while the bulls gore, the bears hug ad bite, 
But no matter who gets the best of the fight, 
Just give them three cheers 
Instead of ten years, 
In priuon where only the poor man appears. 
If a 
man picks your pocket you say he's a 
thief, 
And call a 
policeman to bring him to grief, 
While a 
poor hungry wretch who is starving for bread, 
should he steal a 
small loaf soon to prison is led, 
'l'o prison is led, to prison is led— 
He's only a 
pauper, so off with his head. 
But the great millionaire, with Jay Gould in the van. 
May swindle the country and steal all that they can. 
Thcy dress in flue purple while their wives dress in silk, 
The law wasn't made to bind men of their ilk, 
Oh no, not at all, no, no, not at all, 
There's no law for stealing when you make a 
big haul.

HIGHER:THAN A 
KITE. 
-ALTHOGUGH I 
am a 
not what you call a " whole team, 
I'm a 
hard crowd to tackle, " you bet l" 
In a 
sociable fracas I 
like a " lone hand," 
Like Preriderity pet, 
Oh, it's nice gentle exercise, hurry, between meals, 
'To throw in your " left, and your " right," 
Just to give some old rooster a 
healthy old swipe, 
And 
4' raise him one higher'n a 
kite." 
Down in New York City there's been a 
bad gang, 
Of theives., known as the " Tammany ring ;" 
And, if I'd had the matter to settle ; to- day, 
They'd be all mashing rocks in Sing Sing: 
Yes, work in prison, I 
go for the whole, 
I'd not show any robber a 
'
4 fight," 
But make 'em disgorge every dollar they've stole, 
And hoist 'em up higher'n a 
kite. 
A 
better friend to the poor, than Jim Fisk, never lived, 
He was always the showman's best friend, 
And many a 
poor devil will miss him, I'm sure, 
And mourn his untimely end. 
Ha had faults; but his charity covered them all: 
Now, Stokes, in his pitiful plight, 
"Will be (" sure as the devil is good to his own,") 
Swing higher than Gilderoy's kite.

POMPEY EBEENZER SNOWBALL, 
Written for BILLY CARTER. 
By NED STRAUGHT. 
MY name is Pompey Ebenezer Snowball, 
Pm fr( in the South and always on the mash, 
They say that I'm a 
short-stop and a 
snowball, 
And go from right to left field like a 
flash, 
So all the girls do think that I'm a 
stunner, 
When to the railroad station I 
do dash. 
For a 
first-class one-horse hotel I'm a 
runner, 
Where you can get red herring toast and hash, 
Hardtack, [ SYm.] stale beer, SYm.] 
Pm stumping now to be an alderman, 
Or else I'm going down to San Domingo, 
For I'm a 
double-twisted black and tau, 
My girl who lives right over in Rag Alley, 
Was sailing on the rage-i-ing canawl, 
The piper piay'd the tune of old aunt Sally, 
While the babi-es kept up an awful squall. 
In a 
balloon we made a 
quick ascension, 
And all were pulling hard against the stream, 
But a 
smash up on the cars had caused detention, 
So we bored for oil, and found it all a 
dream, 
Wake up, [ Sym.) oh, hush [SY3.,.1.] 
Never push a 
man that's going down the hill, 
But un-dier the willow she'd be sleeping, 
Tf I 
could find the man that struck old Bill, 
I 
only was the ruler Of this nation— 
New Jersey is of course the place I 
mean, 
On the beach at Long Branch I 
would take my station, 
And at Washington my wife should be the queen; 
At West point my Fred should be a 
cadetter, 
Or marry with some Eastern Princess, 
While at races I 
would be a 
better, 
You can bet that there would be a 
pretty muss. 
U. S 
Granted  
There's many bristles sticking on a 
hog, 
So never put perfume upon your eyebrows, 
I 
wonder what's the matter with the dog,

MY MELINDA. 
DE lust time &V,- I 
met her, 
I 
never shall forget, 
t..:-he took my alabaster brow 
And pressed it to her lips. 
And then she whispered loudly, 
You're such a 
handsome chap, 
Bat she broke my new suspenders, 
-When she sat down on my lap. 
Cnonns. 
Den'ado, good-bye, Melinda, 
Oh don't you cry for me, 
For I'm gwine away to leave you, 
'Way down in Tennessee. 
But I 
ii come back again, my lob, 
When de corn is on de ear, 
And play on de old jaw-bone once more, 
My own Melinda dear. 
ner neck is like a 
beer barrel, 
And her shoulders like a 
clam, 
Her ear is like a 
hoe cake, 
And her nose is like a 
ham. 
She's seven foot and over, 
And her hair so awful red, 
Dat she has to get up on a 
cheer 
When she wants to scratch her head. 
Dell ado, dx, 
17 
I 
wish I 
was an elephanl, 
How happy I 
would be, 
I'd put Melinda in my trunk, 
And always hab de key; 
Or else an alligator, 
And when she went to swim, 
I'd open wide my alligate, 
And take Melinda in. 
Den ado, Jr.c. 
I'd like to be a 
litle corn, 
Upon Melim'a's ear, 
And when she once begin to scratch, 
I 
golly, I'd feel queer; 
Or else I'd like to be a 
wart, 
Upon Melinda's toe, 
And den I'd always be with her 
Wherever she would go. 
Den ado, (to. 
My bosom keeps a 
heaving, 
And my nose is getting sore, 
And my eyes dey fed l 
like griddle cakes, 
So don't you weep no more. 
Oh don't you cry, Melinda. 
Don't you cry, my dear, 
For I'll come back again, my lab, 
When de corn is on de ear. 
Den ado, &c, 
I'LL sing a 
fearful ballad, 
And every word is true, 
About some queer mnsicians, 
That fought, and scratched, and slew; 
The fiddle smashed the doRble bass, 
Knocked the wind out of the cornet, 
The bass drum turned a 
somersault, 
With the cross-eyed clar-i-o-net. 
CHORUS. 
Then blow your trumpets, blow, 
And let the fiddle scrape, 
It's their delight to have a 
fight, 
And let bad gin escape. 
It would make your gizzard freeze, 
Like old Limburger cheese, 
Oh listen how they had that row 
That spoilt the evening breeze. 
The big flute rolled his sleeves 
Broke the jewsharp's sweet repose, 
And grabbed the trombone's lip. 
And smashed his Roman nose. 
The bald-headed fiddle number two, 
Did shake all over with fear, 
When the bassoon grabbed him in B. flat. 
A.nd chewed up his X 
flat ear. 
Then blowt 
The French horn lost his specs, 
Said " gouging " wasn't fair, 
The leader got his back up, 
Threw rosin all over his hair. 
A 
cat-gut scraper tackled a " born,' - 
But his " bugle" did get a 
smash, 
They stood the bass player on his head, 
And cut him up for " prize hash:: 
Then blow, &c.

PARODY ON " FATHER COME HOME." 
Written by D. D. Gooinsa. 
Oh Father, dear Father, pedestrianize with me to our domicile, 
The clock in the belfry of the neighboring court-house has just 
pealed out the hour of one. 
You emphatically promised, my aged parent, to return at once 
from the Hash factory, 
As soon as you had earned the regular sustenance required to 
sr.stain the family gang assembled here, 
The fire disappeared just after you did, and kerosene oil is all 
played; 
And the old dame has been anxious since she dished up the 
codfish balls.. - 
And that little snoozer Benjamin has been squealing for more 
paregoric, 
And there's no one to render any assistance but my royal nibs. 
CHORUS. 
Come home, sherry your nibs, oh daddy, oh head of the family. 
Exercise your pedal extremities towards the attic for which we 
pay the rent. 
Oh, author of my being continue your meandering with me to 
• 
the place of our present residence, 
For that mammoth time-piece with the aid of bell metal has

I'm sure he's got the delirium triangles, and mother says he's 
going to peg out, 
And that before the bright Aurora again gilds tlie easzern horizon, 
And this is the verbal communication she wished me to convey 
to the author of her misfortunca. 
Oh daddy, turn your back on the door, and greet my mother 
with your detestable presence.

CHORUS. 
Proceed thitherwarcl, come toyour roost, please papy, dear papy. 
On my beaded knees I 
implore kind Providence .to aid you to 
reach your domicile. 
Oh Father, you old snoozer, can't you leave this lot of bummers 
and come with me to our tenement. 
That monitor that calls the eig,:it hour men to their labor in 
the morning has just sung out three. 
The house is as lonesome as a 
Quaker meeting, the hours as 
long as the PresidentiAl message, 
For the old woman with tears running down her cheeks (since 
she eat the onions) and your humble servant. 
Yes we are in complete solitude, and that Benjamin has handed 
in his checks,, 
And gone with that gang of little Ariel flutterers with wings on 
their shoulder 
And this was the last remark escaped his lips ere he fell over-

LAST CHORUS. 
Hear the dulcet silver toned warblings of your precious kid, 
As they float on the breeze, and echo answers from the other 
side of the .alley,way.

Everybody's fast and furious, 
Nothing's like they used to was. 
Seems to me its mighty curious 
What folks around me does, 
Whiskey rings and politicians 
Uncle am didn't once allow, 
Fusil oil and Grecian benders, 
That's the style they do things now.

At the girls they like to smile, 
Dyed mustache and paper collars, 
Curly hair as slick as ile, 
How they get the stamps to back it 
Nobody can tell you how, 
Diamond pins as big as hen's eggs, 
That's the style they do things now.

To de new Jerusalam, 
She would go a

Dis_ female dead beat— 
With her peddler Pete, 
Oh he wants to give me plenty room, 
For I'll distribute him in microscopical fragments, 
I'll bite him, and gouge him as fine as mince meat, 
Dat he have to be swept up wid a 
broom. 
And, now I'm what yon call: 
A " busted institution," 
But I'll not take a

'Till that rooster an' me are " quits," 
Right over his oft eye, 
I'll put a

I'll whale him, until he's as blind as a

Then she'll get " particular fits." 
Cnones. 
I'll make her take out those teeth, 
Shake ever stitch I 
Lought her, 
She's a 
bugle-eyed fraud— 
Her ears ought to be chawed 
As well as- her big turn up nose. 
But if she won't, come back 
They can both stick off to Utah, 
And raise young nigger Mormony, 
On Brigham Young's plan, 
Those two unhealthy frauds and dead beats!

NEVER LOSE YOUR GRIP. 
TUNE. - Whole Hog or .2Vone. 
There's many droll expressions that we're using nowadays, 
And if you've no objection, at one of them we'll gaze; 
And this one we will analyze from the bottom to the tip 
I'll tell you what the cognomen is, " Never lose your grip." 
CHORUS. 
Then wake up fellows,we soon will make the trip, [ Svm.) 
I'm sure before we re done, we'll have a 
heap of fun, 
You can bet your bottom dollar, that we'll never lose our 
grip. 
Now, there's our pretty ladies, deck'd in their plumage gay. 
Who show their pretty ankles, as they cross the muddy way. 
They flirt with all the gentlemen, as through the streets they 
skip, 
Their pouting lips just seem to say, " Oh, never lose your 
grip." 
Then wake up, &c. 
met a 
bummer Vother day, whose nose was very red, 
His hat was much too small for him, he'd a 
swelling in his 
head; 
A 
ten cent note was in his hand, he was going for a 
nip, 
Sy-he, " with this I'll buy a 
drink and never lose my grip," 
Then wake up, &e. 
And .there's our politician% who for offices do seek, 
They ii spend their money freely, and so eloquently siva 
31 
But when they are elected, they'll go in for the scrip 
They'll haul in all the greenbacks, and they'll never lose their 
grip. 
There was an honest yeoman, who fought for liberty, 
He couldn't tell a 
falsehood, though he fell'd his father's tree, 
His name it was George Washington, hurrah for him, hip! 
hip ! ! 
In the hearts of all his countrymen he'll never lose his grip. 
CHORUS. 
Then good bye one and all, for now we've made our trip, 
[Svm.] and now'we're done, we've had our fun, 
Hurrah for General Washtugton, who never lost his grip. 
PARODY ON "PUT ME IN MY LITTLE BED," 
Originally sung by BILLY CAR'; 
Oh, Birdie, I 
am exceedingly fatigued at this moment. 
I_ do not care for an exhibition of your vocal abilities, 
All day you've displayed them to satisfactory advantage, 
So put your head beneath its usual feathered protector. 
I'm sleepy too, the apprcach of slumber is apparent, 
And, Birdie, when my habitual devotions have been dis-
posed of 
I 
want to prostrate my person in the arms of Morpheus. 
So put me in that soothing harbor designated as my virtuous 
couch. 
CHORUS. 
Come affectionate feminine relative approach, 
Kiss me with compliments of the hour, 
For I 
my evening devotion have uttered, 
I'm infinitely fatigued and fain would seek repose, 
So put me in that resting place designated by the usual ap-
pellation of my little bed. 
Oh, nirdie, repeat the ejaculations of our maternal protector;)! 
When she to thd abode of eternal bliss was summoned 
She told me always to assume a 
disposition of amiability, 
Aud never, never stray from the paths of virtue and prudence. 
1'11 ne'er forget the day her spirit departed from its mortal 
casket. 
She placed her digits upon my devoted cranium, 
And whispered softly, retain my obedient offspring, 
And then I 
received information to the effect that she had 
shuffled off this mortal coil. 
Come affectionate, ctc.

A FAMOU, Hen Convention 
Was held in Humbug Green— 
Such a 
show of fuss and feathers 
Ne'er before was seen; 
With Malays, Bantams, Chitagongs, 
. 
And game-fowls, fine and tall; 
But Mr. Rooster Shanghai 
Cut the biggest swell of all. 
It was cackle, cackle, cackle, cackle, 
Flap your wings and crow, 
And Shanghai shancred the highest 
At the Hen Convention Show. 
Says Malay, pulling out his gills, 
" 
I'm the fairest fowl," 
Says Bantam, "You're a 
hen-pecked race— 
Hen-hearted, with no soul." 
Says Shangai, " You Door Bantams 
Are a 
race of chicken toys," 
says Bantam, " If you peck at me 
You'll find I'm one of the boys." 
It was cackle, (Le; 
A 
Poultry duel came en straight—,--, 
''Twas Bantam and Shanghai: 
A crow at first, and then a 
clip, 
And then the feathers fly. 
Young Bantam spurred him fiat 
Amid a 
loud convention crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the lowest 
At the great Convention show, 
It was cackle, &c.

I'VE been waiting for more than an hour, love, 
Yes, waiting and watching for thee, 
While hoping and praying you'd come, love, 
And keep true your promise to me; 
For, you told me you'd meet me this evening, 
And listen to what I've to say— 
For, to speak the plain truth, I 
am certain 
I 
can't tell you all in a 
day: 
Cnonrs. 
By the lilies that float down the river, 
By the cowslips that grow on the lea, 
By the roses that bloom in the forest, 
I'm waiting, my darling for thee, 
Fm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee; 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee. 
For more than a 
year I 
have waited, 
That promise from you to receive; 
So surely you'll not break your word, love, 
And leave me your absence to grieve. 
So I'll watch and I'll wait here still longer, 
In hope of your coming this way, 
When the dim, misty vail of the twilight 
Has shut out the brightness of day.

TWILIGHT IN THE PARK, 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
'TWAS on a 
summer's day. 
I 
met her all by chance; 
Her smile was bright and gay, 
And loving was her glance! 
We wandered in the " mall," 
We strolled beside the " lake ;" 
Her pretty hand so white and small 
Of course, I 
chanced to take ! 
We talked about the swans 
And all the other birds, 
I 
thought I 
heard sweet music 
When I 
listened to her words! 
She leaned upon my arm ; 
The sun went down the west, 
I 
tried in vain to whisper all 
The love within my breast! 
CHORUS. 
Twilight in the Park ! 
Twilight in the Park 1 
Cupid lingers there, 
And no one near to mark! 
Some one by your side, 
Happy as a 
lark! 
That's the time I 
love, 
Twilight in the Park I 
She left me at the gate, 
And sweetly said goodbye; 
I 
begged to know my fate, 
And half suppressed a 
sigh-? 
She said she'd come again, 
And natn'd the time and place; 
Her absenc- saw:, my heart such pain, 
Foz heav'n shun_ in her face! 
So every da:7,. I 
watched 
In love's delightful trance, 
And sun enough, we met again, 
She mew me at a 
glance! 
'Twas ^ve 
sight, I 
said, 
And as he : 7 grew dark, 
I 
won her heart for ever more, 
At twilight in the Park!

WON'T you tell me, Mollie darling, 
That you love none else but me? 
For I

You are all the world to me. 
Oh! tell me, darling, that you love me,

Look up, darling, tell me this: 
Do you love me, Mollie darling? 
Let your answer be a

Stars are smiling, Mollie darling, 
Through the mystic vail of night; 
They seem laughing, Mollie darling, 
While fair Luna hides her light; 
Oh! no one listens but the flowers, 
While they hang their heads in shame, 
They are modest, Mollie darling, 
When they hear me call your name. 
Mollie, fairest, Ste.

ONE April morn, when walking down, 
A 
quiet country lane, 
I 
overtook a 
fair young girl, 
Whilst hurrying through the rain. 
I 
asked her " If she would accept 
My arm and take a 
share 
Of my umbrella ?" " Thanks, kind Sir, 
I 
will," replied the fair. 
SPOKEN.—One with golden locks, by Jove, and without one 
of those useful articles (holding up ' Jmbrella)—when she 
-)opped her little arm in mine, my heart beat to that degree it 
-learly dislocated my 
ribs (of the Umbrella I 
mean) it's a 
fact I 
:.hought to myself, here's a 
chance to go— 
Cuonus. 
Courting in the rain, courting in the rain, 
I 
neer regret the day I 
met my charmer in the lane. 
Courting in the rain, courting in the rain, 
'Twas sweeter far than moon or star, 
Whilst courting Ary Jane 
The rain poured down alarmingly, 
C I 411 n 
to a 
tree we came, 
• 
;4M shelter took beneath it: 
• 
s:r :-" there I 
quickly learnt her name. 
She also told hie where she lived, 
With Pa down at the farm, 
A 
turner's daughter: well, said I, 
That is an extra charm. 
_ 
SPOKEN.—I 
glory in country life, and a 
farmer' e 
daughter.' 
what could be better ? I 
wished the rain would ke,eP on 
rather liked— 
Courting in the rain, &o. 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright, 
The little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light— 
I 
gently pressed her arm in mine, 
And said: " Now don't say nay, 
But let me come and meet you here 
Again, some other day." 
SPOKEN.—" Well, she said, I 
can't exactly decide, you must 
rtA my Pa—" So I 
made up my mind to go in and inform tin 
old gentleman we'd been 
Courting in the rain, & c. 
We reached the old farm-house, and than 
She introduced to me 
Her Pa, a 
jolly nice old ooy, 
With him I 
made quite free: 
I 
told him where and when Pd met, 
His daughter in the rain, 
And bleed the lucky chance that took 
Me down that country lane— 
SPOKEN.— The old gentleman was quite delignted with my • 
kind attention, sod! soon gained his consent, whicn proves the 
truth of the old proverb—" It never rains out it pours," and sr. 
It occurred to me through—

,THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR ) 
Or, Where's Rosanna Gone? 
As sung by G
ORGE HARRIS, 
0 ONCE I 
was as gay 
As a 
jolly young cock sparrow, 
Who's perch'd upon an apple tree, 
Or down amongst the corn. 
But now clean through my heart 
You could drive a 
large wheel-barrow, 
For my love has left a 
hole it it, 
0 
where's Rosanna gone. 
Cnonc.
s. 
I 
shall nertr kiss my love again behind the Eitchen door, 
I 
shall never squeedge my darling's little finger any more. 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone until it's rather sore. 
Oh! where's Rosanna gone. 
I'm sure no other maid 
Could equal my Rosanna, 
Without my love this manly form 
Will soon become a 
wreck; 
Of her Dad I 
was afraid. 
lie's a 
disagreable tanner, 
And he's often promised faithfully 
He'd dislocate my neck. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, &c. 
:pt 
6iening after tea, 
While her Daddy blew his ' bacza,, 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, and 
Ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my! how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden wall, 
As tho' I'd just been shot. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, &-c. 
I'd jumped over the wall one night, 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And tho' I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad, the tanner, 
Oh! my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
I 
should never see my love, &c. 
Some say she's hid away, 
By her cruel Dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me. 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my gray cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come and frighten her Dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
I 
shall never kiss ray love, ttc.

DANCING ON THE BRAIN. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
OF all the nigs you ever see for dancing or for singing, 
Such a 
fig as me you never see to set the boards a-ringing; 
I 
go to balls and parties too, in moonlight snow or rain, 
I've got so fond of dancing that I've got dancing on the brain, 
Cnouns. 
You twist your heel and shake your toe, 
Now this is how you do it, (
Music.) 
Everybody's getting it and none seem to complain, 
I 
reckon it's mighty pleasant to have dancing on the brain. 
There was a 
ball the other night, I 
got an invhation, 
I 
went and got my purtty's on with the greatest exultation; 
I 
was not dancing long, when I 
found it mighty plain, 
That all the gals was after me for dancing on the brain. 
You twist your, &c. 
Such a 
happy fig I 
do declare was never yet created, 
To dance and sing is my delight, and yet I'm celebrated; 
And how I 
got this dancing fit I 
never can explain, 
But I'll carve my way to glory, oh, with dancing on the brain. 
You twist your, Ix.

THE HAPPIEST DARICIES OUT.. 
WE'VE just arrived in town to-night, 
Our story for to tell, 
We don't care much if we ain't white, 
Our color suits us well; 
We practice on the heel and toe, 
And then we sing and shout, 
We're always welcome where we go, 
We're the happiest darkies out. 
CHORUS. 
Just watch the movement of the shin, 
We kick dull care about, 
And always wear a 
jolly grin, 
The happiest darkies out. 
When our plantation work is done, 
We go upon a 
spree, 
ro have a 
little sport and fun, 
Our hearts chock full of glee; 
Let politicians rave and blow, 
Let Horace Greeley spout, 
We care for neither friend nor foe, 
We're the happiest darkies out, 
Just watch, dm. 
We both support double-breasted heels, 
Which bring us lots of cash, 
We both love 'taters and fried eels. 
And don't go back on hash; 
And thus we pass each night and day, 
Take dull care by the snout. 
And make him scoot some other way, 
From the happiest darkies out. 
Just watch, &c, 
We go to a 
fancy colored ball, 
And dance a 
jig or reel, 
We fascinate the wenches all, 
By the movement of the heel. 
They think we are aristocrats 
From Beacon street, do doubt— 
" 
But no," we cry, " that's all my eye,' 
We're the happiest darkies out. 
Just watch, &c. 
The rebels soon will get their pay 
For cutting people's throats, 
And so will Jeff, who ran away 
In his wife's petticoats; 
To old Salt River he will steer, 
Just by the shortest route, 
And we will entertain you here, 
The happiest darkies out, 
Just watch, tte. 
WHILE strolling thro' the park, one summer afternoon, 
To catch the cooling breezes and inhale the sweet perfume, 
Of nature's fragrant bouquet so charming and sublime, 
I 
met a 
fairy creature so lovely and divine. 
She was reclining in the shade by the margin of the lake, 
And a 
novel she'd been reading if I 
don't mistake, 
She was just the charming creature that poets love to see, 
And my heart it fluttered in my bosom to get free. 
CHORUS. 
This lovely girl set my heart in a 
whirl, 
So I 
have no rest night or day, 
Her lovely eyes so blue pierced me through and through, 
And robbed me of my heart right away. 
She was looking at the boats as they went sailing by, 
And as I 
passed along she on me cast an eye, 
Of lovely blue so fine which did like a 
diamond shine, 
Which caused me for to sigh and wish that she were mine. 
She slyly dropped her glove from the chair on which she sat, 
So I 
quickly picked it up and laid it on her lap: 
Oh! thank you, sir, said she, in a 
voice so soft and sweet, 
And she smiled as I 
sat down beside her on the seat. 
This lovely girl, &c. 
We conversed an hour or two and then I 
saw her home, 
As she had no escort—she being there alone, 
And I 
told her of my love, how cupid with his dart, 
Had through her lovely eyes made a 
capture of my heart, 
Then I 
asked her to be mine and become my little wife, 
She blushed and answered, " yes," Isms the happiest moment 
of my life, 
So then I 
named the day that she's to be my bride, 
And kissed her good night at the door. 
This lovely girl, Sce.

Of a

With a 
face so sweet, and a 
style so neat 
And a 
step just like a 
fairy. 
We courted long, our love was strong: 
How, I.wished that she would have me! 
But when I 
did the qt.lestion pop: 
A

And she was so fair, I 
do declare, 
How I 
wished that she would have mop 
But when I 
did the question pop: 
A 
smile was all she gave me. 
I 
sent her notes, I 
sent her flowers, 
I 
took her out a- riding: 
How quick time flies when love and sighs 
Are with the hours gliding I 
A 
rival was my only fear: 
And I 
couldn't think, to save me, 
That when I 
asked her who he was, 
A 
smile was all she gave me. 
Chorus. 
At last, a 
note, I 
got one day, 
And dreadful news it carried, 
Inviting me to come and see— 
Herself and rival married! 
Now off I 
went, on death was bent, 
Resolved that none should save me— 
But I 
am not dead, though she got wed, 
And a 
smile was all she gave me.

ellORL'S. 
Should like an introduction to that urettli- gal dressed tip 
in blue. 
And they say her name is Susina May. 
Oh! how my heart does beat, as I 
trin along the street, 
With this pretty little beauty of Broadway! ( Repeal.) 
Her pretty coal black eyes, like stars are in the skies, 
They stoled this darkey's gizzard right away: 
I 
followed her a 
mile to get a 
pleasant smile, 
From that ,pretty little beauty of Broadway. 
Chorus: 
Should like an introduction, &c. 
I'm going to give a 
ball and invite the darkies all, 
And extend an invitaticn to Miss May; 
And then you'll have a 
chance to join in the dance, 
With the -)
retty-little beauty of Broadway I

AWFULLY CLEVER. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes, 
I've a 
fellah who does'nt like bothah, 
All trouble to him is a 
bore, 
He's an income left him by his mothaw, 
What on earth could a 
fellah want more; 
His favorite sport's killing time, 
His aim's to do nothing at all, 
While some in this world run and climb, 
He takes the trip easy and crawls. 
CHORUS. 
For they tell him he's awfully clevah; 
Oh, so clevah, deuced clevah, 
They say that they nevah, no nevah, 
Met a 
fellah, so clevah before. 
Some fellahs go in for the Armyl 
And some fellahs go in for trade, 
But he hasn't such bores to alarm him, 
His fortune was already made. 
And some fellahs go in for brain, 
And scribble to earn an honest penny, 
Those fellahs deserve all their gains, 
As for brains he could do without any. 
in the park he is often seen driving, 
Be thinks he's Alexis, the duke, 
Whenever he goes in for billiards, 
Be thinks he's a 
hard one to fluke. 
Some times at an evening party, 
To keep us alive in he'll peep, 
Whenever we ask him to sing, 
We are certain to fall fast asleep,

POLLY ANN. 
AT a 
fancy ban tne otner mgral 
My Polly Ann and me 
Was dressed to death in all our best, 
So happy, light and free, 
When .Pompey Smash, a 
colored moke, 
Came rushing in the hall, 
And swore that none could dance with Poll, 
There at the fancy ball. 
CHORUS. 
Strike up the fiddle, 
And let the banjo ring, 
Join in the chorus, 
While merrily we sing; 
Let all the darkets quarrel, 
For I'm a 
happy darkey, 
All in this song and dance. 
My Polly Ann, she looked at me, 
And then she gave a 
sigh, 
While Pompey Smash, he shook his fist, 
With vengeance in his eye. 
I 
kissed my hand to Polly Ann, 
The leader gave a 
call, 
Away went Pompey with Polly Ann, 
The gayest of them all. 
Strike up the, &c. 
Soon Pompey and Polly were married, 
Pompey cleaned the gentlemen's clothes, 
While Polly shouted hot corn, 
Whar the summer breeze blows, 
But now they have retired, 
You will see them no more: 
For Pompey has made his fortune, 
And gone to Baltimore.

We see them day by day, 
And have at first sight fell in love, 
When ere they pass this way; 
A 
charming girl the other morn, 
I

And as I

found she had 
A

CHORUS. 
But I

The first time that I

But when I 
1.00ked, my fate was booked, 
I 
Sealed it with a 
sigh, 
I 
found that I 
had fall'n in love 
With a 
dark and rolling eye. 
Her dress was in the fashion cut, 
Tucked up '.5o gay and neat, 
And when se wanted to cross the way. 
She glowed her pretty feet; 
But then she dropped her handkerchief, 
It was marked "Lucy Y.;" 
I 
picked it up she thanked me 
With a 
dark and roiling eye. 
But I 
never shall, &c. 
Of course this little 'chance I 
took, 
We walked and talked awhile, 
She said, her father he was Hell, 
He lately had struck He; 
When I 
exclaimed, " Will you be mine?" 
Her fellow he came by, 
" 
Walk oil:" he said, or " I 
Will give you 
A

LIZZIE BELL. 
• 
SONG AND DANCE. 
ROVING through the wild wood, 
Where the pretty stream does flow, 
I've seen the house where I 
was born 
Some twenty years ago; 
I 
remember the happy days I 
had, 
In that house where I 
did dwell, 
And that pretty girl I 
used to play with, 
Her name is Lizzie Bell. 
CHORUS. 
To me she's like a 
twinkling star, 
Shining for me ever far, 
She knows that I 
do love her, 
But she does'nt like to tell, 
For I 
think there's none above her— 
My little Lizzie Bell. 
I 
gazed on it in ecstacy. 
It was to me a 
dream, 
Thinking of the fun me and Lizzie had 
When yachting in the stream; 
I 
used to sing her my pretty song 
Of yachting in the bay, 
She used to tell me it was delightful, 
And thought it very gay. 
To me she's, &c. 
I've seen her since and asked her to be mine, 
And she has answered yes, 
Now I 
am as happy as any one, 
I 
really do confess, 
We are a 
happy couple, 
As ever you did see, 
For we always travel together, 
Me and little Lizzie. 
To me she's, cte 
DON'T YOU GRIEVE AFTER ME. 
End Song, as Sung by HARRY KERNELL. 
I 
ONCE knew a 
girl, her name was Susy Horner, 
She is of light complexion and she lives around the corner, 
I 
told her that I 
loved her, she said she was a 
goner, 
I 
told her not to grieve after me. 
CHORUS. 
When I 
am gone, I 
told her not to grieve, 
When I 
am gone, [SYMPHONY.] 
When I 
am gone, I 
told her not to grieve, 
Oh, I 
told her not to grieve after me. 
Oh, Susan says to me, I 
want your hand in marriage, 
She put her hand in her pocket to pay for the carriage; 
Den I 
says, Susy, I'll pay for the ferriage, 
But don't you grieve after me. 
When I 
am gone, ticc. 
I 
kissed her three, she then began to cry, 
She had a 
blubber on her cheek, and a 
tear in her eye, 
I 
says, Susy dear, I'll be back bye and bye, 
Oh, don't you grieve after me. 
When I 
am gone, &c.

Ts those who have never perused the sad story of ("HARLOT= 
irlEILPLR, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sympathised and 
wept with her in her sorrows, &ad glowed with indignation at the 
wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, an oppor-
tunity is afforded of reading one of the moat absorbing works em 
written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
'The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfortrnate 
Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her rnind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, eh! the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a 
striking 
example that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the 
exd leads only to misery and shame.
