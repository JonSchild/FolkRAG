[Letter from John A. Lomax to Carita Doggett Corse,
July 6, 1937]
July 6, 1937
Dr. Carita Doggett Corse Director, Federal Writers' Project Exchange Building
Jacksonville, Florida
My dear Dr. Corse:
Please write me care of Mrs. Genevieve Chandler, Murrell's Inlet, South Carolina, of
any further development of your plan to have some folk music recorded on my machine.
Most of the items in the list of songs you sent me in the letter of June 21, as sung at the
Clara White Mission, are very well known to me, and I have recorded them over and over
again. Moreover, I think this particular group would probably sing the songs in such style
as would not be very appealing. I am hunting for folk music as sung usually only by the
uneducated, the words and music of which have been handed down by work of mouth
rather than by the printed page. Unless you can give me some other distinct leads, I feel
that it would not be worth while to come by Jacksonville.
Yours sincerely, Honorary Consultant and Curator Archive of American Folk Song
