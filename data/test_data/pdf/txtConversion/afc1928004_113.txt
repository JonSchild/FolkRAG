THE FORGER'S DAUGHTER 
0 
Never has a 
romance reader been enthralled by a 
more deeply 
interesting tale. 
The web of terrible incidents woven around 
the life of the beautiful heroine—the forger's daughter—make 
one of the most intricate, exciting, and yet probable plots ever 
imagi ed by a 
writer. 
Indeed, they are mostly facts. 
Many of 
the " solid in n" of Boston will still remember the dismay which 
ran thro' State street when the forger was detected. 
The artifi-
ces of the villain, Creech, are all laid bare

JOHNNY I HARDLY KNEW YE. 
When on the road to Switarthy, ahop, ahoo 
The harvest moon was in the sky, 
I 
heard a 
doleful damsel cry, 
Oh, Johnny, I 
hardly knew ye. 
CHORUS. 
With ye guns and ye drums, and ye drums and guns, 
The enemy nearly slew ye, 
Ye darling dear, you are looking so queer, 
Faith, Johnny, I 
hardly knew ye. 
Where is the eye that looked so wild, ahoo, ahoo! 
When first my heart ye did beguile, 
Why did ye skedaddle from me and the child ? 
Oh, Johnny, I 
hardly knew ye. 
With ye guns, (to. 
'Where are the legs with which ye run, alto°, ahoo! 
When first ye went to shoulder the gun, 
Indeed your dancing days are done. 
Oh, Johnny, I 
hardly knew ye. 
With ye guns, Ike. 
But sad it is to see ye so, ahoo, ahoo I 
And to look on ye now is an object of woe, 
Your reg(ry will keep you still on as her beau, 
Though, Johnny, I 
hardly knew ye. 
With ye guns, &c.

THE COUNTRY COUSIN, 
OE. I SAW EAU KISSING KATE. 
'Twas just ahout 
year ago, 
'When I 
was down at Glo'ster; 
I 
found a 
lass, but now alas! 
I 
find that I 
have lost tier. 
I'm sure I 
never can forget 
The luippy day that we saw; 
Before the day on which we met 
Her Country Cousin, Esau. 
Spoken.—For it was on that unlucky day that— 
CHORUS. 
I 
saw Esau kissing Kate, 
And the fact is we all three saw ; 
For I 
saw"tEsau, he saw me, 
And she saw, I 
saw Esau 
The Crystal P.dace is, no doubt, 
A scene of happy hours, 
To loving viirs mho roam about 
Anionf2;st, the trees and flowers. 
But I 
took Kitty there, and then, 
Unfortunately she saw 
That borridest of country men, 
Her Country Cousin Esau. 
Spoken.—But even then I 
never thought I 
should have to 
say— 
I 
saw Esau, &c. 
She introduc-il this man to me, 
And soon beli.nd a 
statue, 
I 
saw what inAde me audibly 
Exclaim, " I 
am looking at you."

THE COUNTRY COUSIN. [CoNcLuine. 
'Tis sad indeed to have to state, 
What poor unlucky ItIC saw, 
For there was Esau kissing Kate, 
And Kate was kissing Esau. 
Spoken— Yes! they had commenced the business arithmeti-
cally, they begun with simple addition of kisses, went right 
through subtraction, and wouid have gone on to multiplication, 
had it, not been that— 
I 
saw Esau, & c. 
Is this why you both quitted me ? 
Said I, you little tartar ! 
Oh, yes! said she, the rule of three 
Is not so good as Larter. • 
I 
went to school with him, she said, 
And used to play at see-saw; 
So, if you please, 1 
think I'll wed 
My Country Cousin Esau. 
Spoken.—Well, said I. came to a 
concert, but this is a 
con-
certed piece I 
didn't expect to see. 
I 
scarcely knew W hat to 
say, for it was enough to disconcert nie altogether, Whea— 
l. saw Esau, &c. 
I 
took to heart my so/o part, 
For all my former glee, oh I 
Was quite ups t 
by their duet, 
Which put lite up a 
fru oh! 
But still my sorrow wasn't great, 
When in the papers we saw; 
That Mr. Esau'd married Kate, 
And Kate had married Esau. 
Spoken.—Oh, yes, I've quite recover'd now, and am courting 
a 
prettier girl, but still it, is not pleasant to reflect upon the 
day when—

Trust her not, trust her not, oh beware! trust her not, 
She is fooling thee, she is fooling thee, 
Trust her not, oh trust her not ! 
She is fooling thee, she is fooling thee,

Oh she is fooling thee, ctc.

A sweeping trail with ribbon catch, 
A hat that you can't see; 
With handsome ornaments to match, 
And lots of finery. 
Atticed with kids and parasol, 
A fair one to me send; 
And I 
will show you, 'pon my soul, 
The fatuous Grecian Bend. 
Cuonns—The Grecian Bend, the Grecian Bend, 
The famous Grecian Bend! 
And I 
will show you, 'pen my soul, 
The famous Grecian Bend. 
The other eve, some lady friend, 
That had become a " Greek," 
Said unto me, in accents wild, 
- If thieves should ever seek 
To take from me what I 
possess, 
I'd not with them contend; 
But boldly cry, taco all I 
have, 
But spare my " Grecian Bend."

"But boldly. cry take all I 
have, 
But spare my Grecian Bend." 
"Miss Dinah Snow," of. sable hue, 
In festive style arrayed; 
Came loit'ring down the avenue, 
The Grecian she displayed. 
Accosting her in sportive mood, 
She thus to me appeals; 
"

Grt.cian Bend,' 
To balancey my heels."

There's hut one hearing that becomes 
The human form divine. 
Now don't look cross !—I 
shall keep quiet, 
For fear I 
might offend;

That naughty " Grecian Bend."

CHEER UP SAN. 
Oh down in Alabama, 
Before I 
was set free, 
I 
loved a 
blue-eyed yellow girl, 
And thought that she loved me. 
But she has proved inconstant, 
And left me here to tell, 
The sorrow that my heart feels, 
For deceitful Sarah Bell. 
CHORUS. 
Cheer up, Sam, 
Now don't let your spirits go down, 
For there:s many a 
belle that you know well, 
Is looking for you in the town. 
I 
had not much, 
to give her, 
Yet all I 
got I 
gave, 
But wealth and fortune don't belong, 
To one that's born a 
slave. 
A white man came with dollars, 
She fled with him to dwell, 
And broke the vows she made to me, 
Oh, perjured Sarah Bell. 
Cheer up Saco 
Now all day while 1 
am working 
And hoeing up the corn, 
I 
sigh and wish within myself, 
I 
never had been born. 
Perhaps she's gay and happy, 
Wherever she may dwell, 
While my poor heart is breaking, 
For deceitful Sarah Bell. 
Cheer up Sam, &c. 
DON'T TREAT A 
MAN -
DISDAINFIIIALY. 
To get up subjects for a 
song, 
I 
once was very cute, 
But when I 
go to write one now, 
No subject seems to suit; 
The one I've got I 
hope Cwill please, 
I've done the best I 
can, 
I 
want to try and help along, 
Our suffering fellow-man—then— 
CHOICUS. 
Help him with a 
will, my boys. 
ShoW your manly pluck; 
Don't treat a 
man disdainfully, 
Because he's in hard luck. 
When well to do in life we have 
Friends always by our side, 
Who'll comfort us where'er we go, 
And who our faults will hide; 
But if in our career through life, 
Bad luck should us attend, 
They'll pity us, but few will say, 
I'll help him, he's my friend—then— 
Help him with a 
will, cEe. 
With many, friendship's but a 
name, 
At least, that's what I 
think, 
For when you're poor and ask their aid 
Away from you they'll shrink. 
So if you meet a 
poor friend, boys, 
Why, help him with a 
will, 
And take him by the hand and say, 
That you're his true friend still—yes— 
Help him with a 
will, ch.

COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE. 
There's nothing in love but pain and distress, 
No matter how sweet its beginning, 
If either some rogue, or sottheaded fool, 
A 
maiden's affection is winning. 
Observe how that fop, dress'd up in great style, 
Is bowing in courtship to Nancy I 
Of course she is pleased, and thinks to have caught, 
The very Adonis she'd fancy, 
Poor girl I 
couldst thou see with my searching eye, 
'Twould help you his faults to discover, 
But Cupid is blind, and therefore you chose, 
That dressed up machine for a 
lover. 
He offers his arm,—she gladly accepts,_ 
How could she deny him the pleasure? 
He's such a 
nice man ! refined and polite; 
Of all that is good he's a 
treasure ! 
Gallanting her home he talked of his wealth, 
And of his intention to marry, 
Walk in, Sir ! she said on reaching the door, 
And asked him a 
few moments to tarry, 
Yet' long was his stay, the hours quickly fled, 
While talking so sweet to each other; 
When lastly he said : " Allow me to ask, 
In marriage your hand from your mother I" 
Few months after that, I 
met them again, 
When both look'd as sour as a 
lemon I 
The honeymoon's sky was darkened by clouds, 
In spite of her love and his mammon. „ 
Perhaps she found out that riches alone 
Will never afford us true pleasure; 
And that a 
fine man, made up by fine clothes, 
Not always will prove a 
great treasure. 
Be careful, dear girls, when making your choice— 
Forget not 'tis losing or winning ! 
That you may not say " Love only brings pain, 
No matter how sweet its beginning 1"

DON'T STAY OUT TOO LATE AT NIGHT. 
Gaily go the moments by, 
When friends in merriment unite, 
Swiftly horn's of pleasure fly, 
When youth and folly tend their flight. 
But Nv hi 1 
e social joys we share, 
Let prudence limit our delight, 
To keep the morrow free from care, 
Don't stay out too late at night, 
'Tis sweet to taste at early dawn, 
The fragrance that the moist earth yields; 
The fresh and baltnly breath of morn, 
Rising from the lanes and fields, 
But to be " Healthy, wealthy, and wise," 
The proverb, if translated aright, 
Is early to bed and early to rise, 
And don't stay out too late at night.

Of grief, tho' each man gets his share, 
Increasing it he's oft etnploy'd, 
Many a

But oh I 
in doing all we can, 
To spoil the memory of delight, 
The Sil lest and the surest plan 
Is staying out too late at night. 
Youth, they say, will have its fling, 
But nature has this certain law, 
That age must pay the reckoning, 
If the account we overdraw. 
But to be healthy, wealth t, and wise, 
The proverb, if translated aright, 
Is early to bed and early to rise, 
And don't stay out too late at night. 
ENOCH. 
Composed by A. Sr. V INCENT. 
Now once I 
loved a 
nice young girl, 
A beauty I 
declare . 
In fact I 
really thought that she 
Was the fairest of the fair ! 
She lived at home with her papa, 
• 
Old Esocn was his name; 
And he vowed, and swore his daughter she 
Should never change her name. 
Spoken—So one night I 
went to see him, and— 
coonus. 
I 
knocked at the door, out flew Enoch, 
lie knocked me for knocking at the door; 
If I 
meet Enoch, I'll knock lie. 
Such a 
knock that he'll remember me. 
Ile left me standing in the street, 
And looking rather queer; 
I 
never thought he'd serve me so, 
When I 
went to see my dear! 
But I 
waited there till it was dark, 
When Sarah she came out ; 
And seeing me in such a 
state, 
As.ea what it was all about I 
Spoken —When I 
politely informed her— 
I 
knocked at the door, &c. 
I 
told her that I 
loved her true, 
And hoped she did the same ; 
Says she, my fat ,' 
er's made a 
vow, 
I 
shall not change my name. 
So if you wish to gain my hand, 
And married be tO me, 
Just go and ask papa's consent, 
Says I, he'll not agree. 
spoken—For you know very well that only a 
few minutes ago— 
I 
knocked at the door, & c. 
Says I, my dear, if you'll elope, 
With me upon the sly; 
To- morrow we will married be, 
Old Enoch then defy. 
She gave consent and off she went, 
And preparations made 
For a 
moonlight trip that very night, 
While I 
went on parade. 
I 
knocked at the door, & c. 
She eloped with me that very night, 
Next day we married. were; 
And often since ilia t 
happy time, 
it does to me occur 
That if old Enoch I should meet, 
I 
wonder what he'd say ; 
To hear his daughter's married and 
So happy all the day. 
I 
knocked at the door, &e.

LIQUID JIM. 
The little pearly dew drop is a 
neat thing in it's way, 
And " mountain dew" is thought by some to be " an fait;" 
But all the praises I've to give I 
must reserve for him, 
My pearl, my duck o' diamonds, my dry but liquid Jim.

Always thirsty as can be, 
No sort of liquor comes amiss to him, 
Such a 
jolly fellow is my liquid Jim.

And willing too, with any one, to wet the other eye,

Such a

His thirstiness has won for him a 
name both near and far; 
He's known at ev'ry club house, yes and ev'ry luncheon bar,

In fact, make no mistake, he'll drink whatever's to be had; 
Such a

Good Burgundy he's partial to, good claret loves as well, 
And never yet was known to turn his nose up at Moselle; 
The very least that I 
can do, is sing- the praise of him, 
My pearl, my duck o'diamonds, my dry but Liquid Jim. 
Such a

The moral of my little song is very plain to see,

TEN MINUTES TOO LATE. 
Certa'n fidgetty folks we have all of us met 
Who are finions for being 1,0 
For a 
two o'clock cicjeuner a 
la far chette, 
They are safe to turn up about noon. 
Punctnality's all very proper I 
know; 
But all hurry and worry I 
hate, 
So it al • ays occurs that w erever I 
go, 
I'm exactly ten minutes too late. 
CHORUS 
Punctuality's all very proper I 
know, 
But all hurry and wonyI hate, 
So it always occurs that wherever I 
go, 
I'm exactly ten minutes too ' ate. 
When I 
jump in a 
Hansom, or climb ma 
Bus, 
To be nicely in time for a 
Train, 
I 
am half in it fever and quite in a 
fuss, 
Tho' I 
feel that my efforts are vain ; 
When I 
find myself safe in the station at last, 
And believe it's five minutes to eight, 
I 
observe with a + h 
that ifs five tninu es past, 
So I'm only ten minutes too late. 
Punctuality's, &c. 
I 
was once on a 
time very deeply in love 
And I 
courted in verse and in prose, 
I 
obtained a 
big lock of her hair, and a 
glove, 
So I 
made up my mind to propose; 
But a 
cab di:ove away as I 
knock'd at her door, 
And her answer decided my fate, 
For my rival had can't' there a 
little before, 
So that I 
was ten minutes too late. 
Punctuality's, &c. 
I 
should sing for a 
month if I 
told in a

The misfortunes I 
have to endure, 
From this habit that's haunted me all my life long, 
And will haunt rue till death I 
am sure. 
When toy fitful career is approaching it's end, 
Atid I 
lie in a 
critical state. 
It's no matter wli t

I 
shall take them ten minutes too late.

PET OF THE ARGYLL. 
Composed by EttxEE CLARKE. 
I 
was horn and brought up at the west, 
At Eton and I 
farrow was taught, 
Mv father was knight of the garter, 
illy mother pi esentc d 
at court ; 
At all the best parties rin found, 
Whe her kettledrum 1 
anquets or fete, 
No assembly is perfect without me, 
At least so I've heard ladies relate. 
CHORUS —
I'm the Pet of the Argyll, the beau of the ball, 
The pink of perfection acknowledged by all; 
The leader of fashion. I 
carry the sway, 
Of all other swells, I'm the swell of the day, 
I 
rise every morning, at twelve, 
Take breakfast, the Mornino• Post scan, 
Take notice of all the last matches, 
And envy each fortunate man ; 
I've a 
box at the opera, cf course, 
K n ow 
Africaine almost by heart, 
I'm considered recherche and ton, 
At Belgravia and all around that part, 
I'm the Pet, &o 
The Derby's excitement I 
scorn, 
With all its rough riding and jokes, 
But with feminine beauty, attended, 
You'll find me each year at the Oaks ; 
There be ting for gloves on a 
horse, 
But which one I 
ne'er care to choose. 
For my fortune is when it is nowhere, 
To pay over the bets that I 
lose. 
I'm the Pet, a. 
I 
find gay life sometimes a 
bore, 
Society's restrietions a 
tie, 
Tim' perfect good breeding has taught me, 
By it's rules I 
must s-rictly abide. 
Should I 
meet. with some new beauty of wealth, 
Who'd be kind and indultren t 
for life, 
My bachelor's rights I'd relinquish, 
At St. George's would make her my wife. 
I'm the Pet, &o.

THE PET OF PALL NALL. 
No doubt you have heard of Par Excellence, 
The dashing young man of the day, 
Likewise the star that shines hi Belgravia, 
And is always so happy and gay; 
But in rne you now see the tip-top of the tree, 
In fact the original swell, 
For me they make way, for all of them say, 
None can equal the Pet of Pall Mall. 
CHORUS.-Oh ! 
yes, I'm the Pet of Pall Mall, 
They call me the Pet of Pall Mall, 
At the West End I 
am the acknowledged 
And original Pet of Pall Mall. 
Of the ladies I 
am an admirer, 
And a 
lover of jolly good fun, 
At all athletic sports very good I 
am thought, 
And at Billiards considered A 1 ; • 
If Croquet I 
play with the ladies, they say, 
I 
play most remarkably well; 
If I 
go to a 
Ball, ' tis acknowledged by all, 
None can dance like the Pet of Pall Mall. 
Oh I 
yes I'm the Pet, 4:te. 
If in Rotten Row I 
take a 
canter, 
An hour or so to beguile, 
The young aristocrats all to me raise their hats, 
And the ladies upon me all smile, 
The swells all confess that my mare is the best, 
For swiftness and beauty as well. 
She'll prance and then bray, just as much as to say, 
My rider's the Pet of Pall Mall. [Oh I 
yes, & c. 
But kind friends I 
now must be going, 
I've stayed here too long I'm afraid, 
For to- night you must know I 
have promised to go, 
To a 
grand ball and masquerade. 
ThotOi the mask I 
may wear, all the ladies declare, 
My elegant form they know well. 
My walk, they all say, is quite sure to betray, 
The dashing young Pet of Pall Mall. [ Oh ! yes, &c. 
THE PRIZE BABY'S FATHER. 
Some men are born to honors great, to gain which others strive; 
While some may do whate'er they like, to them it will arrive. 
I 
never cared a 
fig for fame, or felt ambition's glow, 
'Till my big kid was put on view, at this year's Baby Show. 
But now whene'er I 
roam about, where-ever I 
may go, 
I 
strut as proud as Turkey Cock, and feel like one you know, 
For all the women look at me and sheeps' eyes at me throw, 
As the Daddy of the precious prize shown at the Baby Show. 
Two months ago my wife did bring me everlasting joy, 
By giving me in pledge of love a 
strapping bouncing boy; 
A thumping great big chap was he, such legs and arms did 
show, 
The doctor said he ought to be sent to the Baby Show. 
But now, & c. 
My wife, said she would send the dear, no use my saying nay, 
Married men know at such times wives will have their own 
way; 
And grandma nurse, the neighbors all 
in clamour loud did 
grow, 
Until the child was entered at the famous Baby Show. 
But now, &c. 
Just two stone six the baby weighed, a 
stunner was in size ; 
Lord how the people all burraled, when it had gained a 
prize, 
Some fellow stuck prize on lily back homeward as I 
did go. 
Ohl didn't I 
get well chaffed at the famous Baby Show. 
But now, & c. 
But still you see I 
feel quite proud and keep my chin up high, 
For we intend , my wife and I, for next year's prize to try; 
But if some ladies wish a 
prize, my wife need never know 
I'll lend mine as a 
model for the next year's Baby how.

GARDENER'S DAUGHTER—CONCLUDED. 
BELrNDA, THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER. 
Come, listen, lovers, young and old, 
And I'll relate to you; 
My troubles with my first love, 
She was my last love, too. 
A market gardener's sprout was she, 
A 
lovely flowery shrub, 
Oh, bother her father ! for he was 
A knotted warp'd old scrub. 
Cnonus.— I 
used to serenade a 
very pretty maid 
I 
saw her at the window; 
From her bonnet to her boot, 
I 
thought this chap she'd suit, 
And her name it was Belinda. 
They lived up in a 
cottage inn 
The Market garden ground, 
And a 
paling of sharp spikes and rails, 
The garden did surround; 
The guv'nor guarded it by day— 
A savage dog at night, 
So, of the girl I 
dearly loved 
nevercaught a 
sight. 
Spoken,—Iia, (
1idn't I 
detest her father, the old market 
gardener. 
Shouldn't I 
like to have a 
turnip ( up) with him and 
knock him out of thyme by a 
well planted blow on his ( carotid) 
artery, and put him to bed in his own parsley. 
I 
used to, ac. 
I 
used to dodge my angel when 
She went for " fathers beer," 
And get a 
kiss on the sly, 
When nobody was near; 
I 
serenaded her each night— 
With 
Love not" and " The Cure." 
Oh, lor ! how thund'ring wild it made 
The old chap, to be sure 
[I] 
• 
Spoken.— He used to come and order me off, but as I 
was on 
the other side of the high palings I 
invariably refused. 'Yes, 
even when he offered me a 
bad sixpence to move on I 
replied 
sternly, a 
In Shakespeare: 
"The market gardener that has not music in his soul, 
Must be a 
reglar bad'un on the whole." 
I 
used to, dr.e. 
One night I 
found her Pa was out, 
(She told me on the sly,) 
I 
sneaked into the cottage, and 
What man so bless'd as I 
I 
But who was so unhappy, and ah ! 
Who was frightened more, when 
The guv'nor with his big dog came 
A knocking at the door. 
Spoken.—You might have knocked me down with a 
feather. 
" 
Fly 1' says my sweetheart, " Do 1 
look like a 
party that could 
fly," said I, " Then conceal yourself," she shrieked " or my re-
putation is lost 
and she pointed to a 
cupt-oard, that wouldn't 
hold half of me, " I 
can't get in," I 
said, " then get out," she 
said, and J. bolted through the window. 
I 
used to, sic. 
I 
flew to gain the garden pale, 
The big dog, worst of tykes; 
Seiz'd hold of what I 
sit upon, 
Likewise the paling spikes. 
I 
reached my home with trousers torn, 
Down-hearted , weak and ill, 
I 
have lost my dear Belinda, but 
I've got a 
doctor's bill. 
Spoken.—Likewise a 
tailor's bill, all, well, I come to such 
grief, that in future I 
shall be very careful whenever 
I 
try to serenade, ctc.

BROWN THE TRAGEDIAN.—[CoNcLuDED.1 
You have all seen my name in the bills, 
Which is Junius Atitonius Brown, sirs ; 
And I 
flatter myself I 
have caused 
Great excitement in many a 
town, sirs; 
My last " shop" was the Garrick, Whitechapel; 
In a " part" that I 
could above any fit, 
My " screw," sirs, for only six nights 
Was two pounds and half a 
clear benefit. 
Spoken—That was money, but what do they offer talent now ? 
I 
was actually offered the other day twenty-five " bob" per week 
to play Othello, the Clown in the Pantomime, and do bill-sticking 
in the morning. 
Did I 
accept it ? 
Blood and blue fire I Never 
never! 
But no matter, a 
time may come when they will be glad 
to secure the services of Brown the tragedian.—Cuouus. 
Since Kemble none like me's been seen, 
Yet nought but bad luck is my portion; 
My friends say I'm better than Kean, 
That my " Richard" and " Hamlet" 's 
a 
caution. 
They say my declaitning's a 
treat 
In the speech over Cmsar by Antony; 
I 
can do the soft parts low and sweet, 
Likewise I 
can " pile up the agony." 
Spoken—For two consecutive weeks was I 
the leading attrac-
tion at the Royal Bower, and should have startled the world at 
Drury Lane, but for professional malice. I 
am kept off the boards 
out of fear. They know I 
should render Shakespeare's great char-
acters as they have never been rendered before. 
ilf:// reading of 
his plays is entirely different to Macready, Kean, Phelps, T. C. 
King, and all these fellows. 
They know that; but no matter, a 
time may come when they will cringe to Brown the tragedian.— 
C 
1101LUS. 
I 
search through the " Era" each week, 
And I " write in" when talent's required, 
But they say they don't know me (there's cheek, 
Of such insults and envy I'm tired); 
They offer me terms for a " super," 
Or ask if I'm up to " utility," 
But I'll starve and remain as I 
am, 
An artiste of wondrous ability. 
Spoken—Me, me! Junius Antonius Brown descend to do the 
cock in Hamlet, or Bobby in the Pantomime. Ye Gods and small 
fishes! 
Rather would I 
descend from my pedestal of fame and 
become a 
comic vocalist. 
But no matter! no matter! 
The time 
may come when they will be glad to pile gold at the feet of Brown 
the tragedian.—Cnoaus.

IN FANCY I 
JUST SEE IIER NOW. 
Composed by A UTHOR LLOYD. 
I've roamed along from Lancashire, 
To find my Betty Bray, 
She's left her native village, 
Nine months it is to-day ; 
No rest I've had since she's been gone, 
The time has passed away, 
I 
feel so flabbergasted, 
I 
know not what I 
say. 
C11012US. 
In fancy I 
just see her now, 
Down amongst the fens, 
Getting the new-laid eggs from the cow, 
And milking both cocks and hens. 
Iv'e lots of fights in Lunnon here, 
To-day I 
knocked a 
man fiat, 
Because he holloaed in my ear, 
" 
Old chap I'll have your hat I" 
The hat my Betty gave to me, 
When, with her accents sweet, 
She said l'd wear it for her sake, 
As she fixed it on my feet. 
Spoken — My feet, did I say ? Oh no, my head I mean. 
There, I 
think so much of her, I 
don't know whether Fm on 
my head or on my feet. 
In fancy, ctc. 
Oh, dear what bread my love did make, 
What sucks and trotters, top, 
Such bull's eyes and toffee also bake, 
'With treacle just like glue; 
I'll bet she'd lick the entire world, 
At cooking the pig's fry, 
[1] 
' 
81 
IN FANCY I 
JUST SEE HER NOW. [CONCLVDED. 
And when my thoughts on the taters turn, 
The steam drops from my eye. 
Spoken—Oh, no, not that; the water drops from the taters, 
eyes? No; there, I 
don't know what I'm talking about; I 
canna forget the lass. 
In fancy, ctc. 
One time I 
gave her a 
bran new dress, 
It cost full many a 
groat, 
You shall hear how much she loved me, 
So I'll tell a 
naunygoat; 
She gave me a 
large bit of her dress) 
'Tis truth I 
am telling now, 
Well, I 
g 
,t 
it made a 
waistcoat, 
Just as you see it now. 
Spoken—Ah ! 
there's a 
beautiful vest for you! Why, the 
Prince of Wales never had better. 
How it sets my figure off, 
and us'n't I 
to cut a 
dash in it down at the farm where I 
was 
ploughman, and Betty was dairy maid. 
Didn't we romp and 
play at harvest home, when I 
used to nudge her with my elbow 
and she used to whack my head wilh a 
flail! 
In fancy, ttc. 
I 
see no use in staying here, 
Because I'm losine- time ; 
If I 
could but once meet her again, 
The biggest hills I'd climb, 
So if in town I 
don't see her, 
I 
think I 
shall retire; 
With tears 1'11 weep for Betty Bray, 
All the way to Lancashire.

AFTER DARK. 
Written by J. LLOYD. 
Some fellows boast of sprees they have, 
What funny tricks they play, 
And tell us of adventures, that, 
They meet with every day; 
I 
simply sly it's nonsense, 
That it's nothing near the mark, 
For a 
fellow can't enjoy himself. 
Unless it's after dark. 
CHORUS. 
After dark, after dark, 
That's the time to go for a 
lark; 
After dark, after dark, 
That's tit,: time for a 
spree, boys. 
I 
cannot say I'm quiet, that, • 
lndee I 
would be quite wrong, 
lead a 
haruzn-sca.rum iife, 
In foct I 
come out strong ; 
I 
join my pals in many a 
spree, 
Each one a 
jovial spark, 
Who follow my example, and 
All come out after dark. 
After dark, &c. 
I'm very seldom out of debt, 
In fact, I 
never pay, 
And all my creditors are 
Dunning me from day to day, 
As they depart from daylight's dawn, 
1 
make the night my mark, 
They'll never find this chicken leave 
His roost ' till after dark. 
After dark, ike 
We visit all the Music Halls, 
And always cut a 
shine, 
We join in every chorus, 
As we sip our sparkling wine; 
Our jovial crew are so well known 
We oft hear folks remark, 
Those fellows are the ones who 
Never meet till after dark. 
After dark, & c.

She never glances now at me,

Who deprives me of my daintybits, 
By stuffing. them himself. [Oh ! aint, & c.

TURN A LITTLE HANDLE. 
Polly Poplin she worked at a 
Sewing Machine, 
And lived in a 
garret at Bethnal Green ; 
At a 
furious rate she would run up each seam. 
For you must know this machine went by steam, 
Spoken—And all she had to do was to— 
Turn a 
little handle, feed the needle well. 
Lay the work upon a 
plat ,, 
then you can take a 
spell ; 
To run a 
seam upon a 
machine that goes by steam, just keep 
it clean, 
And. don't go bursting of the boiler. 
One morning when Polly was taking a 
snack, 
Her crinoline rather stuck out at the back, 
The machine started off and before you'd say whack, 
Sewed her up in her crinoline just like a 
sack. 
Turn a 
little handle, & c. 
To stay the machine of course she couldn't, 
To bite of the thread you know she shouldn't, 
To scream she was lazy and wouldn't, 
It sewed up her mouth and then she couldn't. 
Turn a 
little handle, ch. 
Her landlady's name was Mrs. 11PClick, 
At a 
difficult job she never would stick, 
So plying herself with brandy quick, 
It took her twelve months this girl to unpick. 
Turn a 
little handle, &c. 
Now the house it is haunted but causes no fright, 
They've only to put the stuff in over night; 
And it's made into shirts before the daylight, 
So they're making their fortunes, believe me, outright. 
Turn a 
little handle, &e. 
THE YOUNG MAN OF THE DAY. 
You've seen the Telegraph no doubt, 
And read what they've to say 
About this forward youth they call, 
The " Young man of the day." 
It really makes me laugh to think 
How much they'd like to know, 
Of how—with such a 
little coin— 
I 
make so fine a 
show. 
ClIORUS. 
I'm the " Young man of the day," 
And altho' they call me gay, 
As good am I, as those gone by, 
Whate'er the papers say. 
They say I'm both extravagant, 
Expensive, gay. and " flash

And "' neath his table shove

I'd " round" upon the

Then Billiards is another rub,

Away, in such outrages games, 
As Pyramids and Pool. 
What harm is there, I'd like to know, 
In pastime such as these, 
Or " Naafi Beah" at Spier's and Pond's 
Where ev'rything's the " cheese." 
[I'm the, fit. 
Their most unkind assertions, when 
They say I

But treat them with neglect ;

To speak it so clearly, she'd give anything really, 
Would I

get it out of her head, so she must and would learn to—

Oh. 110! monsieur A

Ti' within. , with pleasure, I'll teach her the way. 
Of coarse I 
assented. and he was contented, 
My wife tot was pleased. I 
could see by her look ; 
She quichlv was able to read any fable, 
And parlez-vous Francais, just like a

THE SHOREDITCH GIRL. 
Written by A . 
ST 
.
VrscENT. 
In cosy part of Shoreditch, 
In the merry month of May, 
To commence my pretty little story 
I 
met a 
little girl, 
That you all know \veil. 
And she's left me alone in my glory. 
She had on a 
blue silk dress, 
So I 
couldn't do less, 
Than speak to this dear little maid; 
She'd a 
pretty little head, 
But the hair of it was red, 
And to answer me he seern'd'quite afraid. 
CII0111:5 
I 
brought her from the Standard tr) the 
Alhambra Music ; 
She was highly delighted with the dancing. 
Her pretty little feet well t 
lap, tap, top, 
And I 
couldn't keep her still for her proncing. 
She said that she was single 
And she'd like to get wed 
To a 
chap that was a 
nobLy comic singer , 
And she said as how that she 
Would like to have me, 
If Di pl ace the golden ring upon her finger. 
I 
went as quick as thought 
And the little ring I 
I 
ought, 
And gave it her for evtr as I 
told her; 
Within a 
week from then 
As sure as I'm a 
man, 
She was married to a 
six-foot soldier. 
I 
brought her, &c. 
What naughty girls w;11 do 
To faithful lovers true, 
They fool, deceive and despise them ; 
If a 
chap deceives their eyes, 
And tells them lots of lies, 
They really seem to idolize them. 
You see I've lost my gi! -1. 
3ly little ring as well. 
it serves me right for tieing such a 
g,aby , 
if I 
should married be 
To such a 
girl as she, 
I 
hope that she'll thrash me like a 
baby. 
I 
brought her, &c.

THE LARDY DARDY DO.—[CoNcLuDED.f 
If the duns should annoy which very often they do, 
And domestics admit you're in the way, 
Being caught in the trap, and when there's no escape, 
Then the greatest sang-froid you display; 
So with calm, smiling face, and with unruffled grace, 
The tormentor it's thus you receive: 
I'm just off to my club, and really cannot be bored, 
And Mister Brown with thanks then takes his leave. 
Spoken—Now, that's the best of Brown, he's so easily put off, 
but at the same time I 
must ask you as a 
particular favor not to 
mention to him that—Cnoaus. 
I've a 
wonderful fancy, now, for all that is good, 
Superfine, and the best that can be had, 
What I 
wish for I 
purchase, never asking the price, 
For such meanness would truly be sad; 
As I 
don't mean to pay, it's the very best way, 
Not to ask what I 
don't wish to know, 
For you see Lardy Dardy is no coin of the realm, 
Though I 
find it always seems with me to go. 
Spoken—And very seldom misses fire, but it's not to be won-
dered at, for you see—Cuonus. 
With our fair sex my Lardy Dardy Do is the go, 
And it seems the sweet darlings to impress; 
I've already the question popp'd to more than four score, 
And my answer has always been " yes!" 
But the worldly papas, and the cautious mammas, 
When their daughters' affections I 
woo, 
Always say when I 
tell them upon what I 
depend, 
You can never live on Lardy Dardy Do. 
Spoken—Which is a 
very natural conclusion to arrive at, but 
still the dear girls would gladly share my fate, although.—Cuorws. 
In the Times of to-morrow, if you'll kindly observe, 
Advertised there, this notice then will be: 
Mister Remus MacRomulus is now in town, 
And enabled his pupils to see; 
Will instruct in this art, and his genius impart, 
To the brave, to the fair, and the true, 
Who unable to shell out ready L. S. D. 
Can substitute the Lardy Dardy Do. 
Spoken—Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I'm open from ten till six 
daily. 
Gen? lemen, my terms are moderate, but, of course, ladies 
I 
shall be happy to instruct grati,.., as—CuoRus.

WERY PECOOLIAR. 
THE GAY YOUNG SWELL. 
Have you ever been in love, if you haven't I 
have, 
To tho mighty god koopid,- I've been a 
great thlave; 
lie thot in my but horn a 
quiver of harrows, 
Like naughty boys thoot at cock robins and thparrows. 
My heart was as pure as the white alhatliter, 
Till Koopid my loithoin weak did over mathter ; 
Then ye Gods only know how I 
lov'd one Nith 
There was thomethiug about her tho wery peccoliar! 
Spoken—Wery, wery pecooliar, wery pecooliar, indeed! 
There was 
th oinething about her tho wery pekooliar. 
We met first at a 
ball where our hands did entwine, 
And I 
did thqueed0e her !Inger arid she did thqueedge mine; 
r1'o bo her next p:frtner, I 
ventured to preth her, 
And I 
found that she lithp'11 when she anther'd the " yeth thir.' 
Now, in lithping , I 
think there is thomething uncommon, 
I 
love in pertiklar a 
lithp in a 
ooman ; 
I'm noire you'd have liked the lit up of Mith Julia, 
There was thouttithiug about it tho' wery pekooliar. 
Spoken—Wery pekooliar I 
wery pekooliar indeed! There w.s theme. 
thing about it tho wery pekooliar 
Like a 
beautiful peach was the cheek of my Julia. 
And then in her eye there was thomething pekooliar ; 
Speaking wolumes, it darted each glance to one's marrow, 
As thwift and as Iteen as the wicked boyls harrow. 
A thlight cat ht in her eye to her looks added wiggor, 
A catht in the eye often tends to disfigure; 
But not tho the catht in the eye of Mith Julia, 
There was thowething about it tho' wery pekooliar I 
Spoken—Wery pekooliar! wery pekooliar indeed I 
There was thome-
thing about it tho wery pekooliar ! 
Good friends were we thoou and midst thmiles and midst tears, 
I 
courted her nearly for three or four years ; 
took her to plays and to balls— oh ye pewers! 
Bow thweetly and thwiftly did then path my hours! 
But once, oh e'en now, I 
ray feeline-tha can't thmother ; 
She danced all the evening along with another, 
I 
didn't thay nothing that night to Mith 
But I 
couldn't help thinking twas wery pekooliar! 
Spoken—Wery pekooliar I wery pekooliar 
indeed, thir. Yeth, I 
couldn't help thinking ' twas wery pekooliar ! 
I 
went next day to theold, when she to my heart's core, 
Cut me up by requetlitillo. I'd come there no more; 
And I 
thould be affronted it' longer I 
tarried. 
For next week to another she was to be married. 
" 
Gods! Julia." timid 1, " why von do not thay the." 
. . 
" 
Yeth, but I 
do thir, tho you'd better go." 
" 
Well, I 
thall go, but surely You'll own it. Mith Julia, 
Your behavior to me has been wery pekooliar!" 
Spoken— Were pekooliar! were pekooliar indeed, Mit', 
wery pe-
kooliar! 
Tho from that day to this. I 
have never thcen Julia. 
Her behavior to inc was the very pekooliar ! 
suppos! you've heard of the gay young 
Dourbon Bob and the jolly dogs, 
But the one of whom I'm g)ing to tell, he's a 
beau of mine, 
I 
met him first in Central Park, 
A handsome, gay youn!2,- swell, 
Ile approached me with " my lovely dear, 
You are a 
charming belle." 
ClIOEUS. 
My dear girls, my dear girls, 
He's a 
beau of mine; he's a 
beau of mine, 
My dear girls, my dear girls, 
He's a 
beau of mine, he's my beau, ha ha. 
We 
stroll'd along, he saw me home to ask Ma could he marry 
me, 
He'd seen the world, no more would roam, he'd be a beau of 
mine; 
At first Mama at him did stare, and said, " 0, what a 
swell ! 
My dearest child, he has lovely hair, if he has money, all is 
My dear girls, &c. 
I 
said, Mama, he's lots of cash, but little brains within his 
As long as I 
control the cash, he can be a 
beau of mine ; 
When v.-0 
walk out, the girls at us do stare, and say I'm quite 
a 
belle, 
-When he's dressed up I 
do declare, you'd say he's a 
gay young 
swell. 
My dear girls, etc.

DON'T HAVE TOO MANY STRINGS 
TO YOUR BOW. 
Dear girls, for a 
minute, just listen to me, 
I'm going to sing you a 
song; 
And pray don't be tossing your Leautiful heads, 
As I 
soberly trundle along. 
Pin going to tell of a 
pert little amid, 
Like some ru be bound 3-ou all 'MOW, 
Who, pouting and sighing, was constantly crying, 
" 
I 
wish I'd a 
string to my bow." 
Now, perhaps you may say, " Well, and where was the harm ? 
A wornan should ne'er dwell alone; 
You surely can't think there was much fault to find, 
When the poor thitg sigh d 
only for one !" 
I 
grant you're quite right, had her longing stopped there 
But did one content her ? Oh, no 
As soon as one swain dangled after her train, 
She si.di'd for more strings t
o her bow ! 
New lovers in plenty come hovering round, 
Each courting a 
favoring snfile ; 
But, fickle as fortune, she trifled and played, 
And of course she grew older the while. 
Air ! 
little she dreamt of hor hard fate in store 
Of her roses fast ceasing to glow ; 
'Till she found to her grief, Time— that pitiless thief* 
Had puck d 
every string from her bow ! 
Be warn'd then, dear girls— of coqueting beware, 
Or my in(aail you'll prove to your cost; 
And find, like poor puss in the fable of old, 
That y, u've play'd with the mouse till it's lost. 
Plain, homely advice I'm presuming to give— 
You'll take it in kindness, I 
know ; 
If you'd make a 
good wife, and be happy for life, 
Be conteut with one string t•i your how .

THE GENT THAT HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS. 
Air.—" Motto for every Man." 
No doubt you all wonder what object this is, 
With visage so pale and so wan ; 
But spite of appearance and woe-begone phiz, 
I 
was once a 
respectable man. 
Fortune cnce smiled; and (ray as a 
lark, 
I 
fluttered from niadit un til morn ; 
But now I 
can only steal out after dark, 
My clothes are so tattered and torn ! 
In prosperity, I 
could have every one's praise ; 
But, now, inn it gent that has seen better days. 
Hot dinners and suppers I 
once used to give, 
had friends— quite a 
host ( I 
was told); 
But now by myself I 
may sorrow and grieve; 
For my friends, like Inv sippers, are cold. 
And then, in my chaise, I 
once drove them about, 
To the race-course, the hunt, and review ; 
Now, my friends— out of kindness, there can be no doubt, 
In return they all drive me out, too. [ In prospority, cite. 
My coat is all threadbare, and has but one lap— 
I'm the jest of eacll impudent youth; 
They say it is sleepy for want of a 
nap— 
Out at elbows, I 
am in good truth. 
Not it crown in my pocket, nor one in my hat— 
The showers my only crown pelt: 
My shoes, too, poor soles, don•t know what to be at ; 
For, my toes will peep out:at the welt. [ In prosperity, & c. 
As I 
pass by the cookshops, no one can tell 
The terrible craving I 
feel ; 
I 
feast, on the steam and savoury smell, 
But hunger in Vain for a 
meal. 
In the window I 
gaze \N 
ith a. wistful eye, 
As the joints, boiled and roasted, I 
mark; 
Then turning away, with a 
heart-ren ling sigh, 
I 
dine on the trees in the park. [In prosperity, &
c. 
Each former acquaintance I 
happen to meet, 
Conversation with me seems to spurn ; 
They cut me : it once— passing over the street 
I 
get noth rig to cut in return. 
My landlady, too, clangs hard for her rent, 
In language my very heart loathes; 
And yet to my feelings, I

I've no rent but the rent of my cloth s. [ in prosporil v,

THE LUMBER MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER. 
In Baxter Avenue, near Cow Bay, 
A merchant used to dwell ; 
He was dealing in the lumber trade, 
For matches he did sell. 
His melodious voice you could hear every night, 
Crying out " Hurry up, 'IOW 'S your time; 
Shoe blacking, shoe laces, and matches I'll give, 
Two boxes to you for a 
dime." 
This lumber merchant had fourteen sons, 
Of daughters he had abutt eight; 
In the lumber trade he had put them all, 
Excepting his daughter Kate. 
I 
told the old man if he'd put her at that, 
She'd pick up and spoil all his plans; 
So to Catharine Market he sent her then, 
To learn how to open clams. 
At the oyster stand where Kitty did work, 
Was a 
gallus young oyster boy; 
Admired he was by all of the girls, 
And his name was Sammy McCoy. 
And Sam and Kitty soon grew very thick, 
And she thought a 
great deal of young Sam; 
For he was the boy that showed her how 
To open her very first clam. 
[1]

LUMBER MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER.—CoNarDED 
But the love of Kate for the oyster boy, 
Was not very strong or true; 
For she soon hitched in with a 
charcoal man, 
Whose name was Jimmy McCue. 
The way he was used made Sam feel sore, 
Loud curses he laid on the pair ; 
And he said if she didn't come back right away, 
He'd do something bad to get square. 
But charcoal jimmy, he stuck to Kate, 
And Kitty she stuck to him ; 
Then Sammy McCoy, with an oyster knife, 
Went looking for charcoal Jim. 
But Kitty aml Jim soon heard of the news, 
Which made them take to their heels; 
So to Russian America then they went, 
To learn to fish for seals. 
When the news was brought to the oyster boy, 
He knew not what to do ; 
So he thought he would try to ease his mind, 
By eating an oyster stew. 
That oyster stew was the cause of his death, 
lie was choked by a 
piece of a 
shell; 
And that was the last of the oyster boy, 
For now he is gone to—Heaven.

THE MAUVE KID GLOVE. 
In the Madison Square one day 
Last week, I 
chanc'd to hie there, 
And while a-strolling IT and down, 
A damsel sweet did spy there ; 
Her hair was of an auburn bright, 
Her face a 
thick fall hid it, 
But the loadstone of attraction—there, 
'Twas a 
mauve kid glove that did it. 
C110111.7S. 
Although her face I 
did not see, 
For the thick, black fall that hid it, 
The guiding star that led me on, 
'Twas the mauve kid glove that did it. 
Thinks I, that fall, if I 
knew all, 
Some lovely face conceals there, 
More, when the dove took off her glove, 
And a 
nice small hand revealed there; 
- 
I 
thought I'd then make bold to speak, 
So thus I 
did address her : 
"Will you take wine, my young divine!" 
I 
hadn't long to press her. 
Although, &C. 
She, with a 
winning lisp, said, " Thir, 
You really quite confuthe me, 
I 
do not mind, you are tio kind, 
I 
cannot well re futhe thee." 
" 
Accept my arm " said I, " my charm, 
Pray don't be bashful, darling," 
[

THE MAUVE KID GLOVE—(C 
,NCLUDED.) 
" I will, Mir, plea/fie," said she with ease, 
" 
For there'th nought in you alarming." 
Although, & c. 
As we went on, she met one John, 
Introducing him as " cousin," 
"Indeed !" said I. " Yes," her reply, 
" 
I've got at least a 
dozen; 
But of them all this one I 
call 
To me the most endearing, 
So now then, John, with us come on." 
Anything to me but cheering. 
Although, ch• 
Now I 
was loth, between them both, 
My love vows to be talking. 
Not only that things go so flat, 
When there are three a- walking. 
" 
Two's company, but three is none." 
I 
whisper'd to her slyly, 
Said she, " that's true, I 
don't want you, 
For my husband's cousin Reilly." 
Although, &c. 
Then afl.er all my gallantry, 
At me they set off laughing, 
And call'd me all the simpletons, 
While the mob around kept chaffing ; 
So with a 
glove ne'er fall in love, 
Quit my sight ! avaunt ! forbid it ! 
For you can see how it scrv'd me, 
'Twos a 
mauve kid glove that did it.

" 
Well, really now, you seem so bad, your looks I 
am commiserating,, 
Sir," she said, " but let me see, I 
must have time to think." 
She appeared so lovely, so bewitching, and so captivating— 
"Anything you make," I 
said, " my darling, I 
shall drink." 
When for some seconds, more or less, this charming girl had stood, 
Said she, " I 
think an eye-opener, my dear, would do you good; 
You're queer about the optics, and you're husky in the voice, 
1- 
But there's a 
card, with list of drinks, and from it take your choice." 
Spoken—And she handed me the card with such a 
sweet smile, FOMC-
thing like this,—you know the sort of smile—what I 
call the droop. I 
took the card and read as follows—Cnonus, as before. 
Said I, " A private smile from you is really quite as sweet as honey, 
And a 
lady's blush, is more becoming than a 
frown; 
A 
pick-me-up is very nice, and, made by you, worth any money— 
I'd enjoy a 
pick-me-up if you would knock me down." 
Said she, •• Oh, come now, that's enough, sir, you're inclined to rave— 
1 
wish you would be quick, and tell me what you're going to have l" 
Said I, " How can I 
choose, my dear, from such a 
spfendid lot ? 
I 
can't make up my mind, so I'll have everything you've got." 
Spoken—" What," said she, " everything?" " Yes,'' I 
replied, " every-
' 
thing on the list."—Cllonus, as before. 
Said she. " Now 
don't he stupid, for to take them all would be such folly, 
One or two I'd recommend, but pray don't take the lot; 
For, as all the drinks are iced, sir, the result would be most melancholy, 
I 
am very certain you would freeze upon the spot." 
Said I, " I 
wouldn't care a 
pin, I'd think it rather nice, 
A smile from you. I'm very sure, would quickly melt the ice; 
And, as I 
must make up my mind, my choice at once I'll take, 
Indulge me, please, by mixing a 
luxurious rattlesnake." 
Spoken— I 
did enjoy it, too, it slid down my throat so beautifully. and 
was so nice that I 
was induced to try the lot- she couldn't attend to any-
body else, she was so bm ,y 
mixing for me. Now you take my advice, boys, 
if ever you feel seedy, just turn into the Caf6 Riche. 2'26 Piccadilly ; ask 
for the proprietor and mention my narae—that'll be quite sufficient, you'll

I 
want to taste sonic; 
of your American drinks I've heard so much about." " Indeed l" 
ejaculate. 
I'm glad to hear they are spoken of in such complimentary 
terms; will yon have one with me ? " " Thanks," you'll say, 
I

SOAP, STARCH AND CANDLES. 
Last Easter Monday I 
went out 
Arid took a 
trip t 
o 
Kew, 
'Twas there I 
met this darling girl 
Of \vhom HI sing to you. 
Yes, on the steamer we first met, 
And I 
felt my heart go whop. 
When she told me her name, and then 
Described her father's shop, 
Spoken. —  
And I 
cuiillii't help but admire the business-like 
way in which she enumerated the different articles, namely :— 
cnonus. 
Soap, starch, and candles, .Hander's brick and turpentine, 
Pepper, glue and mustard, Golza oil and scent. 
Black lend and clothes-lines, treacle, peas and British wine; 
Colors mixed for painting, pots and brushes lent. 
We saw them play at kiss in the ring, 
We joined them in the scene; 
She always threw the glove td me, 
To chase her round the green. 
And when I 
caught her, oh ! what bliss, 
To span her slender waist ; 
Bat when I 
kissed her then I 
thought, 
'Twas heaven such lips to taste. 
SpOken.—All hut one thing, I 
thought I 
could detect a 
slight 
flavor of— 
Soap, starch, tke. 
When night closed in, I 
saw her home, 
It was rmt very far ; 
When we got there she introduced 
Me to her Pa and Ma. 
I 
said, I 
hoped they were quite well, 
And then I 
heard a 
sigh ; 
And said, I 
hoped we should one day, 
Be joined by a 
closer tie. 
Spoken. — And when 
sighed, ladies and gentlemen, you can 
believe. NVI1011 I 
say, I 
felt rather queer ; not being used to the 
united odor of— 
Soap, starch, ctc. 
But now T 
am used to all the smells, 
For I 
spend most of the time 
Behind the counter, for I 
think, 
'Twill all one day be mine. 
Last week the old folks gave consent, 
Now all my fears have fled; 
Next week will end my single life, 
I 
shall be a 
married man instead. 
Spoken. — And not only a married man, but alse a 
shop-
keeper, and I 
shall always keep the best of— 
Soap, starch, & c.

"I'M A TWIN ." 
SUNG BY MR. HOWARD PAUL IN THE CHARACTER O' 
" 
STALEY M YLDEW, THE rooll RELATION." 
In form and feature, face and limb, 
I 
grew so like my brother, 
That folks got taking me for him, 
And each for one another; 
It puzzled all our kith and kin, 
It reached a 
fearful pitch, 
For one of us was born a 
twin, 
And not a 
soul linew'which 
One day ( to make the matter worse), 
Before our names were fixed, 
As we were being washed by nurse, 
We got completely mixed; 
And thus you see, by fate's decree, 
Or rather nurse's whim, 
My brother John got christened me, 
And I 
got christened him. 
This fatal likeness even dogged, 
My footsteps when at school; 
And I 
wa ,3 
always getting flogged, 
For John turned out a 
fool, 
I 
put this question fruitlessly, 
To every one I 
knew. 
What would you do if you were me, 
To prove that you were you! 
Our close resemblance turned the tide, 
Of my domestic life, 
For, somehow, my intended bride, 
Became my brother's wife. 
In fact, year after year, 
The same absurd mistakes went on ; 
And when I 
died the neighbors came 
And buried brother John.

FASHION ON THE BRAIN. 
Air—" 
Conny 0' Raynor Brighton Road." 
It seems to me the women now, 
Dress up most awful queer, 
In narrow skirts and little hoops, 
How funny they appear ; 
Their hair they friz in fancy shapes, 
I've laugh 'd 
and laugh'd again, 
To see how queer the women look, 
With chignon on the brain. 
To-day I 
met a 
little miss, 
Rigg'd up in wondrous style, 
She had a 
little bonnet on, • 
That really made me smile; 
T'was smaller than a 
cabbage leaf, 
Dried up for want of rain, 
how very queer the women look, 
With bonnets on the brain. 
They say they wear their dresses short, 
To show their pretty feet, 
But if their shoes are No 7's, 
Extremes will never meet; 
And when they wear their dresses long, 
And dragging in a 
train, 
I 
always think of bean poles with 
Gored dresses on the brain, 
Oh well, this is a 
curious world, 
False teeth, false calves, and oh! 
Tiley speak of palpitators, but, 
The truth I 
do not know. 
But let them wear wha t'er they will, 
Remonstrance is in vain, 
And they are really charming with, 
The fashion on the brain.

I'M THE MAN FOR THE LADIES. 
Music by G. LEYBOURNE. 
Permit me to bring to your notice. 
Plantagenet Augustus do Brown ; 
The pride and the joy of the ladies, 
The beau of the West end of the town. 
With historical William the Conqueror, 
You must know my ancestors first came 
Over here—so I 
need not inform you, 
flow related I 
am to the same. 
Spoken—Oh, yaas, I 
take after William, I'm a 
Conqueror, for most 
positively and decidedly— 
C1101:17S. 
I 
am the man for the ladies, 
Wherever I 
chance to go; 
At Sdree or Ball I 
captivate all, 
For of course I 
can't help it, you know. 
There was some fellow called Don Giovanni, 
Now he was thought quite a 
great gun ; 
Ile used to run after the ladies, 
But the darlings they after me run. 
At dejeuner or Soiree I'm feted, 
When with wit or quotation I 
slime; 
And when at a 
Ball, each fair creature, 
Declares that my waltzing's divine. 
Spoken—So you perceive— 
Of course I 
admire the poets. 
Read passages teeming with love; 
Or else I 
can do the romantic, 
When the little stars twinkle above. 
I 
can sigh, or loo deeply dejected, 
As though I 
felt Cupid's keen darts; 
Which has wondrous effect em, the ladies, 
Who declare I 
am breaking their hearts. 
Spoken—Which proves beyond doubt, that— 
I 
can .sing in the delicate tenor, 
Or in a 
duet take part ; 
Make love in Charades with the ladies, 
Or else take a 
hand at Ecarte. 
To please them I'm noel' at a 
loss, 
They declare that my like ne'er was born; 
I 
can give them a 
row on the water, 
Or else play Croquet on the lawn. 
Spoken—So of course it is agreed unanimously that— 
I 
am the man, &c. 
There are mothers with daughters to marry, 
Who NVOlider I 
don't take a 
wife ; 
I've chances enough, but I'll tarry, 
Ere I give up this glorious life. 
ITow the' ladies would go on without mo, 
I'm at a 
loss really to tell ; 
So 
still be the envy of swells, 
And the delight of each grishint-
t• belle. 
Spoken—For it's something doosed jolly to know— 
I 
am the man, &c. 
I 
am the man, & c. 
I 
am the.; man, &c.

THE BLOATED YOUNG ARISTOCRAT. 
The Honorable Sidney Fit zdoodle, 
Is standing before you. just now 
I'm looked upen as a 
noodle, 
And often get into a 
row. 
But this all my friends can attest, sir, 
Although I'm inclined to be fat ; 
I 
can take my own part with the best, sir, 
Tho' a 
bloated young aristocrat. 
C 
LIOIZUS. 
You can see by the style of may walk-, 
The shape of my coat and my lint ; 
Igy style and my air, the cut of my hair, 
I'm a 
bloated young aristocrat. 
Of fashionable life I 
am weary„ 
And from it I 
soon shall retire ; 
For everything seems to be drea:-y, 
There's nothing I 
really admire. 
Excepting a 
sweet darling creature, 
Who says I'm inclined to be fat ; 
Ind rather inclines for to marry, 
The bloated young aristocrat. 
You can see, & c. 
My good looks T 
often do rue, 
What it is to be handsome, alas 1 
There's one girl in Filth Avenue, 
I 
notice, when I 
pass. 
At the window, along with her poodle, 
For the last fourteen days, she has sat; 
Merely to gaze at Fitzdooille, 
The bloated young aristocrat. 
You can see, & c. 
I 
really must thank you profusely. 
For the kind way you have listened to me; 
Amt really trust you will exense me, 
If, by accident, I've 'wen too free. 
The gent's I 
thank for theft at 
To the ladies I 
In e 
off my hat ; 
But to see you again's the intention, 
Of the bloated young aritocrat, 
You can see, &.c
