Johnny TroyCome, all ye daring bushrangers[,?]And outlaws of the land,Who scorn to live in
slaveryOr wear a convict's band.Come, listen to my story[,?]To that most solemn layOf those most
mournful days,The days of Johnny Troy.Troy was born in Dublin,That city of great fame,Brought
up by honest parents:The world knows the same.For the robbing of a widow,He was sent o'er
the main,For seven long years, to New South Wales,To wear a convect's chain.There were Troy,
Bill Harrington,Tim Jackson, and Jack Dan,Four of the bravest heroesWhoever handled gun.Said
Troy to Bill Harrington,"Load every man his piece;For this very night I intend to fightAgainst the
horse police."There were six well-armed policemen,All seated in the bow;And they were none
surprisedWhen Troy commenced his row.And they were none surprisedWhen Troy he made
a rush,And six more brave heroesRushed bravely in the bush."And it's now we've gained our
liberty,Our escape we will make sure;We'll smash and break those handcuffs,When once we reach
the shore. 2 2 of 2

"When once we reach the shore, brave boys,We'll shout and sing for joy:We'll hiss and stone
those horse police,And sing Bold Johnny Troy."They chanced to meat an old man,All on the kings
highway,And Troy rode up to him,While these words he did say[,?]"Your gold match and your moneyI
quickly do demand,Or I'll blow out your brains instantly,If you refuse to stand.""It's [neither?] watch
or clock I ever had,"The old man then replied;"But for a wife and familyI daily do provide."- - - - - -

Johnny Troy.Troy then mounted an his steed,And before he rode away,He said, "Here's fifty pounds,
old man;'Twill help you on your way."The poor I'll serve both night and day,The rich I will annoy;The
people round know me right well;They call me "Johnny Troy["".?]
