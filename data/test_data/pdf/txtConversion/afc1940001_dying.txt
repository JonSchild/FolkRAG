The Dying CalifornianLie up nearer, brother, nearer,For my limbs are growing cold,And your
presence seemeth dearerWhen your arms around me fold.I am dying, dying surely;Soon you'll
miss me from your berth,And my form it will be lying'Neath the ocean's briny surf.Hearken to me,
brother, hearken,I have something I would say,E'er this vale my vision darkens,And I go from hence
away.I am going, surely going,But my hope in God is strong;I am willing, brother, knowingThat He
doeth no thing wrong.Tell my father, when you greet him,That in death I prayed for him,Prayed that
I might one day meet himIn a world that's free from sin.Tell my mother, God assist her!Now that she
is growing old,That her son would feign have kissed herWhen his lips grew pale and cold.Hearken
to me, catch each whisper,'Tis my wife I speak of now.Tell, oh, tell her how I missed herWhen the
fever burned my brow.Hearken to me, closely listen,Don't forget a single word,That in death my
eyes did glistenWith the tears her memory stirred.Tell her now to kiss my childrenLike the kiss I
last impressed;Hold them as at last I held themFolded closely to my breast.Give them early to their
Maker,Putting all her trust in God,And He never will forsake her;He has said so in His Word. 2 2 of
2The Dying CalifornianOh! my children, Heaven bless them!They were all my life to me.Would I could
once more caress themE'er I sink beneath the sea!'Twas for them I crossed the ocean,That what my
hopes were I'll not tell,But they've gained an orphan's portionThat He doeth all things well.Tell My
sister I rememberEvery kindly parting word,And my heart has been kept tenderWith the thoughts
her memory stirred.Tell them I never reached the havenWhere I sought the precious dust,But I've
gained a port called heavenWhere the gold does never rust. **Urge them to secure an entrance,For
they'll find their brother there;Faith in Jesus and repentanceWill secure for them a share.Hark! I hear
my Saviour calling;'Tis his voice I know so well.When I'm gone, oh, don't be weeping;Brother, hear my
last farewell. *

cold , And your presence seemeth dearerWhen your arms around me fold.I am dying, dying surely ;
Soon you'll miss me from your berth , And my form it will be lying ' Neath the ocean's briny surf.

Hearken to me, brother, hearken , I have something I would say , E'er this vale my vision darkensAnd
I go from hence away.I am going, surely going , But my hope in God is strong ; I am willing, brother,
knowingThat he doeth no thing wrong.Tell my father , when you greet him , That in death I prayed
for him , Prayed that I might one day meet himIn a world that's free from sin [?] Tell my mother, God
assist her!Now that she is growing old , That her son would [fain?] [feign?] have kissed herWhen his
lips grew pale and cold .
