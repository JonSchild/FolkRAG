BRENT BJÖRKMAN: Okay. Today is May 30. And this is Brent Björkman—May 30, 
2014—the Folklife Program, with the Folklife Program, and I’m continuing my work 
with the occupational folk culture of park rangers project I’m doing with Jon Kay at 
Traditional Arts Indiana. I’m interviewing people that are connected to the National 
Park Service here in Kentucky. And I’m here at the home of Bob Ward. Bob could 
you intro-, could you say your name and, and tell us about your connection to the, 
the National Park Service. Or you first, your last job a the Nat-, National Park— 
 
BOB WARD: Yeah, my name’s Robert Hatton Ward, my full name, and I go by Bob 
Ward. And my last job at the National Park Service was at Mammoth Cave National 
Park. I was the Chief of the Science and Resource Management Division.  
 
BB: Okay. Well I’ve been asking people, I’ve done several of these interviews and it’s 
been just an enlightening experience. One of the ways that we start out the 
interview is to talk about, you know, maybe your first connections to thinking about 
this as a career. You know, some people have had other careers prior to it, but it’s 
really the origin story of, of the person that I’m, that I’m interviewing.  
 
BW: Right.  
 
BB: Could you, could you speak to that to begin with? I know you’ve had a lot of— 
 
BW: Yeah, I know you mentioned earlier about people’s first encounter potentially 
with national park service rangers was on a vacation or, or something like that, and 
the guy in the flat hat and you know. My experience is quite different. I grew up in 
middle Tennessee in what’s now part of Percy Priest Lake. So my family farm was 
acquired by the US government when I was twelve years old. And so my first 
encounter with people in ranger-like uniforms and flat hats was with the Army 
Corps of Engineers. And my dad would say that, you know, there were people 
pulling in the driveway to appraise the property and he would say, “The dam people 
are here.” And ‘damn’ was the only cuss word I was allowed to say growing up 
because it referred to the ‘dam,’ the Percy Priest dam as opposed to the cussword 
‘damn.’ So my first encounter with people in uniform was through that ex-, that 
whole experience of land acquisition. So I was on the sort of receiving end of things 
from the government in that sense, rather than, than the more, potentially more 
positive encounter of the ranger helping you out of the car, helping you with a 
guided tour or something like that. So I sort of went from that experience to my 
father talking about, ironically during the Memorial Day time period, growing up, 
the Yankee cemetery in Murfreesboro. And in my childhood was regarded more as a 
Northern holiday. And African-American folks went to, to decorate the graves of 
Union soldiers. Of course, a lot of them were in the, what was known as the US 
Colored Troop. You know, a lot of them were African-Americans who had fought in 
the Civil War and died in some cases in, in the Civil War, so that was an experience. 
And then for some reason, and I’m not quite sure why, at, at the age of seventeen, I 
started working as a volunteer in the park at that same Yankee cemetery, at Stone’s 
River National Battlefield. And from there I worked through—that was 1971—and I 
worked through really the Bicentennial in 1976. And in 1977, I got a seasonal job at 
Stone’s River National Battlefield. And then on a lark of all things, in the, I guess 
January or February of 1980, I came with two ladies from Stone’s River National 
Battlefield to a women’s conference scheduled at Mammoth Cave. And the, there 
was supposed to be a speaker fly out of Atlanta on a park plane, park service plane, 
and land in Glasgow and come do this women’s conference thing. And I just kind of 
went along for the ride. Well, the guy didn’t show up because the weather was bad, 
and so we spent the whole day touring the surface and the subsurface of Mammoth 
Cave National Park, courtesy of the other folks, you know, that were here, the Chief 
Ranger and, and other people. And I said, “Well, hey, this looks kind of neat, you 
know. I mean, I enjoy the Civil War stuff, I’m really into the history of the Civil War. 
But I really, this is kind of a neat place. It’s got history and all the stuff. How do you 
apply to get a job up here?” So I applied that year, barely got in under the deadline to 
get my application in and got a seasonal position at Mammoth Cave National Park 
and started in, in June of 1980 as a seasonal park guide. So, and then I worked ’80, 
’81, ’82 and the spring of ’83. And again another sort of lark circumstance for me, I 
was at a, I wasn’t employed during the winter, but I was up here on a, some kind of 
training thing that the park was having, and even though I wasn’t scheduled to 
attend it, I was here visiting, they said, “Well, you can join in this training session if 
you like.” And I did, and there was a guy there from, I knew his name for years and 
I’ve forgotten it now—John Hiscock, I think may have been his name. But he had a, 
had an announcement for a job at Jean Lafitte [0:05:00] in New Orleans. And he said 
he had thought about applying for it, but really wasn’t going to be able to apply. And 
so I put in an application for this job at Jean Lafitte National Historic Park in, in New 
Orleans in the spring of ’83. And lo and behold, got the job. So I worked there from 
June of ’83 to October of 1984 as a living history ranger, which is really what I’d 
been trained at, trained in at Stone’s River. But I wanted to come back to Mammoth 
Cave. My parents were elderly and I wanted to be close to home. This was a hundred 
and ten miles away from, from home, so I applied to come back to Mammoth Cave, 
applied actually for a part-time job, even though I was full-time in, in New Orleans. 
Well, Bob Deskins was the superintendent here of Mammoth Cave at that time, and 
he had just been appointed to a regional office position. And in transition of me 
going, coming back to Mammoth Cave and him going to Atlanta, he made all the 
part-time people full-time. So even though I had stepped down to a part-time job 
just to be able to get back close to my parents, I actually came back to a full-time 
position. So, you know, it’s just amazing how things, it, I reflect on it quite a bit. It’s 
just, it, life is a game of inches, and it’s a game of, you know, doing, doing something 
at the right time and sometimes not even realize you’re doing it. You know, it just 
happens for you. And some would say providence and some would say luck and 
some would say some combination thereof. But, so at any rate, I got back to 
Mammoth Cave in the fall of, of ’84 and then the very next year, I became a summer 
seasonal supervisor for the, the guides, and you, you know, have a certain group of 
park ranger guides and you’d go on tours with them and audit them and things like 
that. So I did that ’85 and ’86, and somewhere along in that time period, and I don’t 
actually remember exactly when, but sometime during that time period, because of 
some impetus from the park and impetus from Ed Bears who was the chief historian 
for the National Park Service, they started wanting to hire what were called 170 
series historians for the parks. In other words, have the expertise of the historical 
research in the park rather than having the park having to go either outside totally 
or having it to go to Washington or Atlanta or wherever. So the park advertised for a 
GS-170 series historian position that was a GS5/7/9. So if you got it, you didn’t have 
to compete for the seven or compete for the nine, you would move up incrementally 
as you gained the skill level that the park assessed that you qualified for the next 
level. So I was very fortunate in, I think it was August of 1986 that I got that position 
and was the park’s first historian, 170 series historian. There have been certainly 
other historians connected with Mammoth Cave in other capacities, but the 170 
series was really near and dear to Ed Bearss’ heart because to him it said that you 
were a positive degree person, you had a history degree, at least at a Bachelor’s 
level, and you were going to be duty-stationed in the park and connected with the 
other historians. There were several historian positions hired in Southeast region 
along about the same time. And I forget everybody’s name, but there was Terry 
Wenchell down at Vicksburg, me at Mammoth Cave, the guy at Chickamauga will kill 
me because I can’t remember his name, but at any rate, there were several of us 
hired along about the same time in the same program. So I worked in that capacity 
for about two years. It should have taken three years I think to complete the 
program. We changed superintendents along about that time, Dave Mihalic came in 
the park, actually he was hired in the fall of ’87 and started in the park in January of 
’88. And he had sort of a different view of things. He wanted more of what was being 
termed a cultural resource specialist. He wanted a cultural resource manager, or a 
program manager. And then under that person would be historians, archaeologists, 
folklorists, all of the disciplines would be sub-disciplined in effect under that, that 
cultural resource specialist program manager. So he, he, I was transitioned from a 
170 series back into what’s called 025, which was the original park ranger series in 
the National Park Service. So I was transitioned to that which wasn’t the positive 
degree requirement position, but that’s all kind of bureaucratic kind of stuff. And so 
I became the cultural resource spec-, cultural resource management specialist for 
the park, I think was the full position title. And that would have been, I think that 
would have been January of ’89, if I remember right. And then I worked in that 
capacity, [0:10:00] and, and we were, I was in interpretation at the old position of, of 
the historian position, was in interpretation. And when I became cultural resource 
specialist I was moved over to the new division. Actually it was an office at the time, 
of the science and resource management. It wasn’t even a full division until probably 
’91, I think, when Jeff Bradybaugh got here as chief, it became a full division. So for 
roughly from January of ’89 to probably the spring of ’90 I served in that office, in 
that office of science and resource management. And then that chief, Steve Cheney, 
left to go out west to be, I think a superintendent, or he may at first moved to be a, 
you know, a chief or something and eventually became a superintendent. And 
during the interim period between the time he left and the new chief of the new 
division was hired, Jeff Bradybaugh, I actually served as acting chief of that office 
and eventually that division. And so when Jeff Bradybaugh got here there was again 
some look at specialization, you know, we were trying to get an ecologist hired and 
people back in the positive degree requirement positions. And my position title was 
pretty much left the same but I was put back in the 170 series, and it resulted in a 
grade increase. So I moved not just from the 5/7/9 that I’d applied for, but non-
competitively moved into a GS11 position. And through the experience that I’d had 
as the acting capacity under Dave Mihalic in the office of science and resource 
management, I moved into more or less a quasi-assistant chief or deputy chief role. I 
was never designated that during that time period. Eventually Jeff Bradybaugh 
moved on to Zion National Park. He’s the superintendent out west now and 
eventually did some other acting chief ca-, you know, stints and would get a 
temporary promotion at times to a GS12, so I had that going for me. And then 
eventually they did, under Jerry O’Neill was chief here from 1998 through 1999, and 
he had come out of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. And he was used to the sort of 
traditional chief, deputy chief, and then everybody else, you know, under, under that 
person. So the park service, the Mammoth Cave National Park did create a position 
called Deputy Chief of Science and Resource Management. And I was moved into 
that position non-competitively at a GS12. So I feel like I’m leading a charmed life at 
this point in my life, you know, to— 
 
BB: And that would be what year all this is taking place, about a ten year— 
 
BW: That was taking place about 1999. So from— 
 
BB: Fif-, fifteen— 
 
BW: From roughly ’86 to 1999, you know, I kind of led a charmed life from moving 
from a GS5 to, to a GS12 in 1999. And then in the year, I think— 
 
BB: Did you feel grateful during that, I mean— 
 
BW: I said, I just— 
 
BB: Did you, did you know about that, did you know this feeling? 
 
BW: Oh, I, I knew the feeling then, and I still feel it, that it’s just another, I say life is a 
game of inches. It’s a game of just un-, unbelievable, you know, just stuff happening 
to you and you don’t always account in, within yourself as to why, you know how, 
you know, I’m just, I feel extremely fortunately, extremely benefitted. And of course, 
in a strange sense, in the park service, you know, the, the greatest job on earth in the 
National Park Service is that front line, visitor contact person. It, it’s probably the 
most important position in the National Park Service. You know, you’re leading, 
you’re leading walks, you’re doing nighttime bat counts, you’re doing, you’re doing 
all this kind of front line stuff that’s generally lumped under, you know, park, the 
park ranger concept. You know, you’re, you’re doing a little bit of, of all of it. You’re 
not really doing the specialization that was called for in sort of the modern era, but 
you’re, you know, you’re, you’re really doing the work of the National Park Service, 
you know. You’re protecting the National Parks. You’re providing for public 
enjoyment, you know. Those, those two driving ethics of, of the National Park 
Service is what you’re doing. So as you move up in the National Park Service in 
terms of rank and pay and all that, ironically you’re sort of moving away from those 
jobs. You’re moving more into trying to get the money, trying to supervise the 
personnel, trying to ultimately carry out that mission. But, but you’re missing the, 
the nighttime bat counts. You’re missing the, the river walk with the, with the public. 
You’re missing the campfire programs. You’re missing those things that are maybe 
the original reason that you saw benefit to this job and to your life and this job in the 
first place. So, so yeah, from, from roughly ’86 when I applied for the 5/7/9 job, to, 
to 1999 when I got the GS12, [015:00] yes, I felt extremely blessed and fortunate 
and was grateful for the position. But, but sad in a sense that you’re moving away 
from what you got into it for in the first place.  
 
BB: And that’s about the time, that’s right, because I was here from, as part of the 
graduate program from ’96 to ’98, so that’s the latter part leading up to that part— 
 
BW: Right.  
 
BB: That’s when I first met you.  
 
BW: Right. Right. 
 
BB: Briefly, and, and you were in that position. Yeah. 
 
BW: Right. Yeah. And in, and in 2000, the year 2000 was the hiring of another chief 
from another agency, and that was Mark Duploy. He came out of the Bureau of Land 
Management. And he was okay seemingly. He at least tolerated the deputy chief. He 
was kind of used to doing it his way, and, and not wanting a lot of help with it, even, 
even from program managers with a lot more experience and skill than he had in, in 
some areas. But at any rate, I served as the deputy chief under him until he left, and 
then by that point in time, Pat Reeve was the superintendent at Mammoth Cave 
National Park, and I got to know him quite well. And, and he was a, very much a, 
very much a people person. Nearly always talked about at meetings, about, you 
know we’re there to help each other succeed. And, you know, he was concerned not 
only about us, his employees as people but even concerned about our families. He 
was really a buck ranger that had come up through the ranks, and moved all over 
the country. I forget how many different park service areas he had worked in. He 
and Derrick, you know, he had worked out west as a search and rescue ranger, and 
he had been at, prior to coming to Mammoth Cave, in—what year would that have 
been? God, I, I lose track of years here. Somewhere around two, Ron Switzer left in 
2005, so probably 2006 is when Pat got here. And, but he just brought a very sort of 
people-friendly persona to the job of superintendent. And when the position was 
advertised for the chief job, for the first time in its history, it was advertised not just 
for the natural resource series, but the cultural resource series as well, which I 
would never qualify under natural series, even though my, my second major was 
actually in a, in a human geography, kind of parks/recreation type of, of major, 
second major. But I really would never qualify under the natural resource series, but 
because he advertised it as both natural and cultural, I was able to qualify 
successfully, compete, in a national application process, and I got the, the chief job in 
the fall of 2008. And was, again, grateful. That was a GS13. So for a guy who started 
out seeing people in uniform, running all over their dad’s farm, through hearing his 
dad talk about the Yankee Cemetery, to doing living history a couple different places, 
and you know, working my way up through the ranks, and probably having a career 
aspiration of no more than a GS9, which is really kind of full performance in the old 
025 series, I was a GS13 in August, or Oc-, excuse me, October of 2008.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
BW: I’m quite humbled by that. I still keep the, the announcement for that job down 
close to my chair here in the den, so. So I worked in, they always say to get your high 
three at your highest grade level. That was fall 2008. But honestly, the bureaucracy 
of, of trying to keep programs like you work with going, you know, trying to get 
grant money to run those types of programs, I was just worn out with it. And so in 
August of 2010, I, I retired with a total of 31 years, 30 years active service, and 
another year of sick leave, which counts towards your retirement, and all that stuff. 
And, and but I gave the park a year’s notice, because I knew the position, not me, but 
the position was important enough not to just come up one day to say, “I’m out of 
here,” you know. I, I was too grateful, and still am, for the privilege of service. You 
know there was a guy years ago who was a deputy director of the National Park 
Service, and I, I forget his name. But, but he said the park service was not always a 
pleasure, but it was always a privilege. And, and that’s very true. Those, those jobs 
are very privileged, and I was very privileged to have the career that I had. So, and, 
and on September 18 of the year—what year did I say? 
 
BB: 2010? 
 
BW: Yeah, 2010. I retired and have moved on to doing other things, but never, ever 
forgetting, and never, ever not being grateful for my career.  
 
BB: Yeah. Well, I can see, just around your house, I mean, you know, we talked 
briefly about getting back to collecting a few, getting back to some Civil War things.  
 
BW: Right.  
 
BB: And you are, like myself, [0:20:00] like our, our undergraduate degrees, 
historians, and I was a social studies person.  
 
BW: Right.  
 
BB: And trying to be able to relay that kind of information, and you laid out a lot of 
great things when you were giving your chronology about how you did, and, and 
about how different people operated, and how they wanted to instill maybe a people 
kind of feel, or, or caring about the—and I know that’s part of the draw to this, is the 
camaraderie, and that’s one of the things that I’m interested in with this project is, 
what is the working culture like, and, and I was wondering maybe the initial 
interpretive qualities of your early years. I know you had people connections, both 
with the general public and increasingly as a supervisor and things, but can we step 
back to, I know it was evolving, you, some of your first experiences, maybe that first 
week or that fir-, of, of the first time you had that job, what that was like for you.   
 
BW: Yeah, it was extremely exciting because I came out of a very rural Southern 
small farm background, with not a, I was an only child, not a lot of interface with 
people. And all of a sudden, there were people around you just doing fun things, you 
know. I mean, I started in 1971, as I mentioned, as a volunteer in the park at Stone’s 
River, and I worked on an environmental study area trail, Isa Trail, one of the, 
actually in a battlefield ar-, setting. They were doing an environmental study area, 
so, you know, not, not to disturbing much as you went along, but creating a pathway 
for people to walk and see plants and things like that. And I got to work with 
environmental education specialists. I thought, heck, this is fun, you know. And 
people would get off work, and they’d all kind of hang out together, and, and there 
was, you could call it a culture, a sub-culture, ever how you classify it, within, you 
know, occupational folklore, but it, but it was just a group of people that worked 
together, had fun together, were at times like a family, sometimes a dysfunctional 
family, you know. They fought some, and you know, and, and recovered and all that, 
but it was just, it was just such a dynamic, fun thing to do, you know. And my first 
supervisor in the National Park Service was from upstate New York, and he was a 
Korean War veteran. His name was Don Adams. And I got almost adopted, kind of 
like, by his family, because I was, I was always the youngish looking. I’m sixty now, 
and I still don’t probably look my age. So I was always just kind of boyish, you know, 
looking, and, and was adopted by the Adams family, and they were a little more 
progressive in some ways than my own mom and dad, you know. I’d go to their 
house for dinner, and even though I was 17 years old, you know, they’d serve Scotch. 
And so I’d have a drink of Scotch. I thought it was the most horrible thing I’d ever 
had in my mouth, and still do, but, but I enjoyed it, and it was, it was just the 
camaraderie of working with people doing things, social things outside of the job 
with those same people, and you just, that just became your friends and, and what 
you did, and it was fun. And, and you know, intellectually stimulating for a, for a kid 
that had really not thought a whole lot about where the heck he was going. Most 
everybody went into a factory, quite frankly, or if they were, you know, privileged 
enough they went in to a big farm. But I grew up on a, you know, really small farm, 
and it was taken away by the government anyway, so we, we moved to town, and 
there really wasn’t just a lot to do. So, you know, it was just something that was 
really fun and, and sent me on a pathway toward getting a degree in history, 
eventually, and, and eventually the career that I’ve described to you.  
 
BB: Right. And because of family, you know, working your way back to this area 
after you went to—where was it? Jean LaFitte? 
 
BW: Jean LaFitte in New Orleans. Yeah. 
 
BB: Yeah. Well, what was that like, to be that, that far away? I mean that, it sounds 
like that, if I remember correctly was about a year before you put in a, a request to 
transfer. 
 
BW: Yeah, I stayed, yeah, that’s about right. I stayed, I got that job in June of, of 1983, 
and got here, back here in the fall of ’84. 
 
BB: I, I guess one of the things I, I was thinking about, I’ve talked to a lot of 
Mammoth Cave people, and the interesting thing about that park is a lot of people 
have just been here, and never left, and, and they have certain feelings, so we can 
talk about that, that later. 
 
BW: Right. Right.  
 
BB: There are people like, oh, David Wyrick, who’s just come on, and he’s been in a 
lot of places. He’s been in DC and, and, and all these places. 
 
BW: Right. 
 
BB: So I’ve asked people about, kind of comparative, maybe about the battlefield 
compared to Jean LaFitte, and then maybe we, you could lead me back to coming 
here, and, and the working culture of, of Mammoth Cave, but the New Orleans 
culture down there, did you have enough time to experience it, or can you— 
 
BW: It was a different, little bit different and crammed up into an urban 
environment. It was, it was a little bit, there wasn’t quite the same thing I’d 
experienced at Stone’s River, or at Mammoth Cave, where you kind of hung out with 
the same people. I mean, Mammoth Cave was bigger than Stone’s River, obviously, 
so when I got here as a seasonal, it wasn’t like everybody got [0:25:00] together 
every night, you know. You were, they were in different groups. But there wasn’t so 
much the, what’s called clique stuff or rivalry. There wasn’t bad feelings out of it. It 
was a real positive, you know, thing, but you would have a group of people that you 
would socialize with, but when I got to New Orleans, it was a real different 
environment. You know, you, it, first of all, it was very expensive to live there on a 
GS5 salary at the time. And then people were nice. A lot of people that worked in the 
park, kind of a similar thing to what you get into at other parks, a lot of your 
facilities management folks are locals. You know, there are people in other, in the 
other divisions that are locals. You got some mix of locals versus people from 
outside. But it wasn’t quite the same feeling of camaraderie at Jean LaFitte that I’d 
had at Stone’s River and Mammoth Cave, so I wanted to come back to Mammoth 
Cave, not only for my parents, but I wanted to get back to what I’d experienced there 
as a seasonal, even though I was coming back as a permanent. So, and it was kind of 
a déjà vu experience, as you might imagine. You get back, and you get handed the 
same post office box key that you handed in when you left, and that’s kind of fun, 
and, and I lived in seasonal quarters for a while, as I had right before I went to Jean 
LaFitte.  
 
BB: Yeah.  
 
BW: But of course, you, as a permanent employee, you can’t stay in seasonal 
quarters very long, so I ended up getting a small apartment in Park City, and lived 
there for about five years, I think from about fall of ’80—well, actually, December, I 
think of ’84 to, I bought this house in the spring of 1990. So I lived there, you know, a 
little over five years, roughly, so.  
 
BB: What was seasonal, what was the, the seas-, the makeup of seasonal quarters? 
That’s been an interesting thing. I’ve talked to a lot of people who are, I don’t have a 
lot of people that talk to me about, about that particular thing. There’s just a handful, 
as— 
 
BW: Well, it’s almost a thing of the past, in a sense. The original concept of the 
National Park Service is that you had people who worked the, in the park, living in 
the park. And then along comes James Watt, in whatever years those were, I think he 
was Reagan’s Secretary of Interior, if I remember right, and that would have been 
sometime between 1980 and ’88. So along comes James Watt, and he pushes to get 
people out of park housing, and I, it stemmed from something, I think maybe in 
California, or something. I don’t remember the whole deal. But, but park service 
housing was never a, it wasn’t a penthouse. It was never, you know, real super nice 
places to live, but you accepted it because you liked living in the park, you didn’t 
pay, you know, really high rates for it. But what James Watt did is he tried to make 
those places competitive with private sector market, you know, housing. Well, the 
problem is the, the price went way up, but the quality of the housing didn’t sort of 
keep up with it. So you’re paying real high rates and not getting the, the housing 
experience that you might could get outside. So people began to move out. Houses 
became vacant, including historic houses, unfortunately, that were built by the CCCs, 
and the, the maintenance of those structures went down. So you had some, you had 
some impact on a lot of things from that, you know, seemingly sort of, I don’t want to 
call it a progressive move exactly, but it was a move to ultimately, to get people 
more into the commu-, it succeeded in getting people into the community. I don’t 
know if that was really his intent or not, but, but it, it had some good parts, but it 
also had some extremely bad parts to it. So, so I, you know, when I moved back here, 
I, I stayed in seasonal for a while, but then moved out and got the apartment in Park 
City, and eventually bought a home here in the community. And there was good 
parts to having people out in the community. They call it ‘flying the flag,’ you know, 
you’re, you’re getting up of a morning with your ranger hat on, and your uniform, 
and you’re, you’re heading off to the park, and people see you, and, you know, you’re 
just one of them, kind of thing. You know, it’s almost a little crazy in a sense, but, but 
you become part of the community more if you’re living out in the community, than 
if you’re isolated with-, within the park, so.  
 
BB: And that was a good—in your mind, is that a good thing? 
 
BW: As I said, it’s a real positive thing. Yeah. The downside to it to some degree is if 
you have an emergency or something in the middle of the night, you don’t have 
anybody on duty. I know, one time I was living in seasonal quarters, and I think, I 
think it was actually after I had moved back from New Orleans, and I was living in 
seasonal quarters. And actually, it was Dave Lyons, Joy Lyons’ husband, that 
knocked on the door late one night, and said, “We’re going to need some help.” And I 
thought, well, I’ll help, but I’m not, I’m not a law enforcement person. I’m not, at that 
time, I wasn’t a, an EMT. I was eventually an EMT, but I wasn’t at that time. I 
thought, okay, I’ll come help, but apparently had some crazy guy running through 
the park, and everybody, you know, was called out to help in some way, and we all 
pitched in and helped in some way, which is a service, [0:30:00] you do what you 
can do, you know, to help each other out, and help carry out the mission, whatever 
time of day or night it is. But, so, you know, that, that, that’s the good part about 
having people in the park, and so therefore the downside of not having people in the 
park is you don’t have that same thing, but, but, you know, eventually the park 
service law enforcement has become so professionalized, and so specialized, that 
you’ve got at least a 24/7 availability of people, albeit a small number of people at 
Mammoth Cave, anymore. Probably not an adequate staff to do what really needs to 
be done. And if they’re not living in the park, then they can get there quickly, 
because they usually go home with their vehicles and all that stuff, so.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
BW: So that’s, my seasonal ex-, seasonal housing experience is somewhat limited 
compared to some of the rest of them, you know, but it, but it is another place where 
people can both, you know, work together during the daytime, and then gather 
socially at night, you know, so. And some of it gets a little wild and crazy, I think I’ve 
heard, but I tried to at, by the time I kind of was out of seasonal quarters, I was 
working my way up the ranks, and I, I didn’t particularly go over to seasonal 
quarters that much to participate. That’s kind of that fraternization thing that you 
got to try to avoid if you can, so.  
 
BB: Right. Right. Your trajectory through the park, and working your way up, and, 
and, you know, part of it, you said, was you missed, you have things by inches. You 
know, you, you have these opportunities and there’s luck, and there’s right place at 
the right time, I think is what your getting at.  
 
BW: Yeah. Yeah.  
 
BB: But it seems there must be a flexibility, because you’re a, a person who always to 
me seems like a thinker and a go-getter. You must have had some influence on, did 
you have an influence on, okay, how’d that worked, and I’m trying to work my ray, 
way around to saying, you didn’t create your own jobs there, by any means, but you 
seem to use the opportunity at hand to play on your own strengths, or— 
 
BW: Yeah, I’d say, I think that’s fair. And I, and I think it’s also one trait that I feel 
somewhat proud of having. I don’t want to get prideful about it. But I know at times, 
even as a seasonal, you know, things would get hard. I mean, you know, there was a 
time at Mammoth Cave when I was still a seasonal that they cut us from 40 hours a 
week to 39 hours a week, and the whole concept was, if you got 40 hours a week, 
you earned annual leave and sick leave I guess, or whatever. If you got cut to 39, I 
don’t recall that we did. And a lot of people, frankly, wasn’t going to do that, and 
moved on, and I stayed with it, either because of my circumstances, or desire, or 
whatever, I was able to take a lot of stuff. At least early on as a younger person, I was 
able to sort of have the patience and just take it, you know, eat it, so to speak, and 
keep going with it. So, and, and of course managers see that. You know, that, that I 
worked at Liquor Barn in Bowling Green right now, and whenever Darryl Blair posts 
the schedule up there for us to work, there’s a lot of guys going “Aw, god, Darryl, I 
can’t do that.” You know, and they’re in his office, going, “Aw, come on. You know, 
what’s going on here?” I never say a word. Some of the schedules I don’t like, but I 
don’t ever say anything. And, and Darryl said to me one day that he really liked the 
fact that I didn’t say anything, that, you know, I said if I wanted off, and he tells this 
to everybody, if you want off, you know, let me know, and we’ll, we’ll work 
something out. But I don’t bitch at the manager all the time about this and that. And 
the managers like that. I mean, and I know it as a manager, you know. You don’t like 
the squeaky wheel getting the grease thing. You want to throw the grease bucket at 
them, some of the time, you know. So, that, when managers saw as I sort of moved 
up the ranks that, that I could take it, be a team player, you know, do what it took to 
get the job done, and, and basically have their back, you know, then, then I think that 
counts towards helping you move your way up, up the institution or whatever that 
institution is.  
 
BB: Right. Because I think they’re indoctrinating you into that larger culture, 
especially as you progress, because you do have to take a lot of stuff.  
 
BW: You do.  
 
BB: And there are a lot of mandates that come down.  
 
BW: Right.  
 
BB: Is that fair? 
 
BW: Yeah. That’s fair. And a lot of things you don’t, don’t agree with. And you just, 
you know, try to, try to make the old bad cliché of making lemonade out of lemons. 
You know, you just try to do the best you can with it. But you know, and, and you, 
you, the park service, overall, for me, well, it’s very much a positive experience, but 
there were some negative experiences too, all along the way, as there are with any 
profession. You know, you, you make a few, I don’t want to call them enemies, but, 
you know, there’s a couple people at the park that won’t speak to me anymore, 
which is, you know, the, a pro-, direct product of having been the deputy chief and 
chief of the division, you know, and, [0:35:00] and that happens, I assume, to 
everybody. I hate it. You know, I hate to be out in a restaurant somewhere, you 
know, or in a small town environment, like around here and run across somebody at 
the post office or the bank or something, and you know, particularly if they’re in 
uniform, and people know that I’m a retired employee, and, and somebody’s a little 
rude to me, or a little curt, or doesn’t speak to me, it, it hurts. I mean, it does. But, 
you know, it’s just a, the nature of the game, so, it, it’s just what, I made decisions at 
times that maybe some people didn’t like, and, and maybe I made bad ones, or 
maybe I made good ones, or maybe some combination thereof, but I don’t, I don’t 
come home every night from the liquor store getting all worried about it anymore. I 
think about the park service, but I always think about it in real positive ways. I don’t 
come home and, and stew about, you know, various things. So I enjoy job at the 
Liquor Barn, and I enjoy wine, and, you know, one of the main reasons I went back 
in the work force was, was really to still be around people, because I, I like that. I like 
the interplay in the park service of people in the resources, and the interplay at the 
Liquor Barn of people and the resources of, you know, what we sell there, so.  
 
BB: Let’s go back to something that you and I, we both, we both enjoyed the 
historical aspects. And you mentioned when you were s-, talking about your career 
in the first part of the interview, about the movement to the idea of not having 
history dictated from outside, but having a historian from within.  
 
BW: Right.  
 
BB: And that, I think that’s an interesting thing. I talked to one of your former 
colleagues, who is also retired, Joy Lyons, who I’ve heard that, and maybe it’s a 
direct result of what you were laying out, that let’s, let’s, let’s celebrate our, our, our 
working rangers who have an interest in a certain area and, and, and push them 
forward to investigating, and learning on their own, and—can you speak to that 
culture? 
 
BW: Well, I think one of the great things, really, about it, and maybe this is true in all 
parks, but I found it really true at Mammoth Cave National Park, is the, particularly 
the guide force, the park ranger guide folks, or park rangers interpreters. I don’t 
know what the right terminology is for it, and I don’t even know what it was in the 
day, you know, when I worked there, but the people who are invested, they’re, 
they’re really invested in the history of, of, of Mammoth Cave and how it, you know, 
came to be the National Park that it is through the, the early tourism. And, you know, 
the tourism of Mammoth Cave goes back to, you know, the, right after the War of 
1812, you know, in 1816, and so there’s, there’s a whole cadre of people that have 
invested themselves. I mean, look at Chuck DuCroix and all the research, you know, 
that he’s done on the—again, probably the name will, will, the guy from Germany 
that did the, the—Kemper, Max Kemper. Look at all the work that he’s done on Max 
Kemper. Just on his own, you know. I mean, people get in-, in-, invested in Mammoth 
Cave National Park in a very personal way, and they do great professional work. I 
mean, they’re, they may not come necessarily out of the positive degree requirement 
position, but they’re basically doing the historical investigation, and they’re also 
then doing that application of that in the interpretive context, you know, which, 
which really was what Mammoth Cave created the historian position to do, was to 
investigate that history, get accurate information together and then, and then 
interpret that to the public. I mean, that, it’s really, and, and that’s very much been 
done at Mammoth Cave, both directly from what Ed Bearss was wanting to do, and 
what Joy has done, what Chuck DuCroix had done, and, and many others over the 
years have done. And just making it their personal mission to interpret that, 
research and interpret that just magnificent resource, both the cave and the, the 
surface. So it, it’s just an important, this is what makes, this is what makes Mammoth 
Cave a real special place, I think.  
 
BB: Yeah, and I think about learning more about you all through the interview 
process, and how even on days off, people are back to the cave— 
 
BW: Yeah.  
 
BB: Doing different things. And I don’t know, is that an experience that you certainly 
have seen it, but is that something you did in your own life there? Did you, part of 
the— 
 
BW: I did early on. It’s one of those things that, that you, you do early on, but as, as 
you sort of, or at least, I sort of, I can speak for my own experience, sort of grew in 
my experiences with the park, where I felt like I was working 70 hour workweeks 
anyway, doing the work, which at times became for me more and more 
bureaucratic, I didn’t particularly want to go back into the park and take a, a late 
night tour or something. I did that to a degree for a while, but eventually, it, you 
know, it eventually gets to a point where you’re just saturated, and you’re not, 
you’re not fresh, and you need to be. You need to really come into [0:40:00] work at 
Mammoth Cave National Park and all national park service areas with a big grin on 
your face, and expressing, you know, that you’re proud to be there, and, and you 
don’t need to be tired and all that. So I, it eventually, with me, kind of dissipated 
after some period of time.  
 
BB: Sure. What was your favorite part of the job—jobs? Did you have a certain 
period where— 
 
BW: Well, almost, almost the drive to work every morning, you know, where you got 
the radio on, and the DJ in Louisville’s talking about the back-up on I-64, or 
something, you know. Or somebody in Nashville’s bitching about the, the, you know, 
whatever, something overturned, you know, and you’re driving through the, 
through the park, and it, it, from here it was about a 15-minute drive, you know, 
when you’re driving down through Doyle Valley or driving in the, the, the area from 
Cave City there out by the elevator. I mean, it’s just the, just the, it puts you in the 
right frame of mind, you know, just you’re driving through the most beautiful 
creation on earth, or one of the most beautiful. And so that, I enjoyed that. I enjoyed 
working with people on the cemeteries, even though the cemetery stuff at times was 
contentious.  
 
BB: Tell us a little bit about that in, in the context of what that means to somebody 
who’s just learning about how parks were created.  
 
BW: Yeah, but—yeah, you know Mammoth Cave National Park was, was part of the 
‘Parks in the East’ movement. It was, it was an attempt to have the big Western area 
type park east of, of the Mississippi River. And it was both an economic reason to 
create it, and, and it was also, you know, a protection, protection of a place. But, but 
it, the whole creation of Mammoth Cave was, was, you know, you’ve got basically 80 
square miles of surface, 30 plus communities that have homes, and churches, and 
therefore you’ve got cemeteries. You’ve got all the sort of infrastructure. I mean, if 
you took that map of Mammoth Cave, that outline of it, and plunked it down 
anywhere in Kentucky, and just counted everything that’s in there, not just 
historically, but now, just say you created that boundary, and you went over here 
somewhere in Bullitt County or wherever, and plunked that down, that would be 
interesting in and of itself as a study, and just count how many churches you got, 
how many schools you got, and all that infrastructure. The impetus was, was to 
make it the, the natural area. And therefore the impetus was to get everything that 
was anthropogenic of the footsteps of man, or people, you know, the visibility of that 
out of the way, and let it go back to nature. So when the C-, the four CCC camps were 
here in the ‘30s, you know, a lot of their work was to go out and raise barns, and, 
and you know, get rid of the vestiges of, of the, the cultural area. Well, anybody like 
yourself, and like I, and like anybody knows you can’t just rip out the structures and 
rip out the culture. The, it’s more than, than the physical built environment.  Culture 
is more than just something that’s, that’s created. It, it’s there. It’s a, it’s people. And, 
and their recollections, and their oral histories, and it’s everything. So, there’s over, I 
forget the exact number now, but I’d say probably 70 cemeteries identified at 
Mammoth Cave National Park. And those are places that, they’ve sort of become a 
challenge from a management standpoint, in a park where you’re wanting it to go 
back to nature, and as people age and still want to go back to those cemeteries, how, 
how do you do that? So that is one thing I did spend a lot of time, all through my 
career, up through the very end of it, in going out, not on the fun tour on the 
weekend, but on going and getting the old guy out of the nursing home, or going and 
getting his grandson who would take me to his house and getting him in a 
government vehicle, and hauling him out to where his grandpa was buried. And, and 
even park service managers at times pushed back on me taking a government 
vehicle and doing things like that. Some park service managers wanted the result of 
the good, the good, you know, neighbor policy you would get out of that, but they 
also kind of didn’t like the whole idea that you were keeping roads open, in effect, 
you know, to get to these cemeteries. So it was both a very challenging, and at times, 
you know, very heart-wrenching kind of process. But working with those 
constituents, I guess, would maybe be one of the highlights of my, my time at 
Mammoth Cave.  
 
BB: Do you have a, a certain story about taking the old guy out? Do you have 
anything where you felt satisfaction, or there’s probably a lot of bittersweetness, or 
giving somebody [0:45:00] a good— 
 
BW: Yeah, there’s, there’s bittersweetness. There was one guy, actually his niece, 
niece lived in this vicinity, I will say, and of course I’ve talked to her about this so I’m 
not telling stories on her necessarily, but her uncle was quite a curmudgeon, and no 
matter what you did for this man, he invariably would write his Congressman that 
you didn’t do enough. So that, that’s kind of a, a bittersweet thing. I’m trying to think. 
There was one gentleman I went and interviewed, did an oral history interview 
with, Mr. Hogan, in a nursing home in Bowling Green. Seemed like he was in his 90s, 
maybe, he might have even been 100. I can’t remember. That’s where I think his 
grandson came and got me, and we went to the nursing home. But I don’t remember 
if we actually took him physically to the cemetery. But a lot of times, you would get 
an old person, I remember George Sturgeon—I guess I can tell these stories without 
getting arrested—but George Sturgeon would show up on the hottest day in the, the 
fall of the year, you know, usually in August, walking on, on two canes, wanting to go 
to, I think it was White Oak Cemetery out in the Northeastern end of the park. And 
other people took him. I, Kathy Profitt that works in interp took him, Ken Kern took 
him, I did. There, you know, there were other people, probably even people that I 
don’t know about that did get him out to, to that cemetery, but he was, he was kind 
of a curmudgeon, too, but, but he, he did get some satisfaction out of that, because 
the fact that he was so lame physically, still so bright, you know, intellectually, and 
so very interested in getting back to, to where his family grew up, and to the 
cemetery. And those things, just when you can accomplish something like that for 
somebody, and see that reaction that they have, whether it’s tearful, you know, or 
whatever. It’s just, it’s a real gratifying thing. And the one other story that brings to 
mind is Mr. Gibson. I think he lived in Auburn, Kentucky. And I’ve always been kind 
of a skittish kind of person, a little bit. You know, I’m a people person, but I’m, I’m 
kind of almost a Barney Fife kind of guy in the sense that I get scared fairly easily of 
somebody. And I had this man approach me, Mr. Gibson, that wanted, wanted me to 
meet him somewhere on the North side of the river, and he told me where, I’ve kind 
of forgot where. I can picture it in my mind, but I forget the name of it. And I got a 
little scared of this guy, because I’d, I’d heard some stories about various people, not 
necessarily Gibsons, but, you know, I’d heard some stories about, you know, 
somebody asking you to meet them somewhere. And this is kind of strange, you 
know, but, so I, Max Vincent was the ranger on duty that night. And Max, I guess, 
knew the guy. But I just asked Max to kind of, can you go with me or follow me over 
there and meet this guy and see what this is all about? And he did, and we met the 
man, and he seemed okay. But what he wanted to do is he wanted to walk me out 
into the woods, and he has his, I think maybe a son with him, or some other 
relatives. He said, “I want to show you where—” I think it was his little brother and 
somebody, a little brother that had died when he was two years old. And some of 
these facts may be a little bit off, but it, it was basically that he wanted to show me 
where this cemetery was. And what became so, and I’ll probably cry trying to tell the 
story, but what became so important to me was that he was one of the people who 
had so despised the park taking the ground, that he would never talk to the park 
rangers. But he knew he was advancing in age, and getting close to leaving here, and 
he wanted to talk to somebody about this cemetery and where it was located, and 
making sure it was on the park maps. I was just very, and still am, obviously, very 
touched by the fact that for whatever reason he picked me to, to talk to. And the, you 
know, the flat hat is both inviting and at times intimidating to local folks and, and he 
wanted, he wanted just somebody to know where that cemetery was, and pass that 
information on before he passed on. And that was an extremely gratifying personal 
thing to me, and that I went into it with such fear, and that he had had such fear of 
park rangers all these, or dislike for park rangers all, all these years, and that whole 
thing came together to take me and show me where that cemetery was and to get 
that into the park information. So that was, that’s one of the touching stories. I 
haven’t thought about that in quite a while. It’s, you know, but I, I still have those 
things in my head, and they come up every now and then, depending on the 
conversation.  
 
BB: That’s a beautiful thing to think about those great things. Yeah. Cool. Now that 
story, you just derailed everything I was trying to think of, because you touched me 
so much.  
 
BW: (laughs) I’m sorry.  
 
BB: No. No. It’s, that’s the great part about this job. You’ve been away from, for 
awhile now, almost four years or something.  
 
BW: Yeah, some-, that— 
 
BB: It’s unbelievable really, probably.  
 
BW: It is unbelievable. You know, you, [0:50:00] I’ve still got the pictures on my 
desktop computer, and people put together photo albums for me of things, you 
know, and it’s just strange at times to think about how you, you sort of look forward 
to that retirement date, you know, when, there, I don’t know if you’re going to talk to 
Mary Jo Veluzat or not, I hope you do, you know, because she basically grew up in 
the park. Her dad was a CCC employee, a CCC person. He met his wife and Mary Jo’s, 
you know, mom there. She was a, and she can tell the story far better than me, I 
maybe just leave her to tell the story of how they met. But his last name was, was 
Calisa. And he was down here from Indiana working in, in the CCCs, and this lady, I 
guess, was taking messages for him, and kept misspelling his name, and he finally 
went over to see her, and sort of straightened it out, and he ended up dating her and 
marrying her, and, and he eventually was a ranger at the park, and eventually 
became superintendent at the park, as he requi-, retired as the superintendent. I 
think he retired from Mammoth Cave. Mary Jo will get this straight, and I’ll get it all 
messed up. But at any rate, they lived in Park City. So, you know, where was I going 
with this story. I forgot where I, where I was going with it.  What was your question? 
 
BB: Well, it was talking about you’re retired, and it, I mean, just it’s been, we were 
talking about it’s been four years already, and— 
 
BW: Yeah, it’s been four, four years. And it, and it, I guess where I was going with it 
is you’re, you work up to the, to the thoughts of retirement, and, and that’s just going 
to be the greatest thing in the world, and then all of a sudden, time starts flying, you 
know. It just, it literally starts just flying away from you, you know, when, and you 
maintain contacts with some folks, like, you know, Phillip and Mary Jo are my good 
friends, and Mary Jo would be somebody really for you to talk to, because not only 
did she grow up in the park service as a child, but eventually became a park service 
person herself, and retired as the deputy of facilities management chief at Mammoth 
Cave. Married Phil Veluzat, who worked his way up through the ranks and retired as 
the chief ranger. So they’re, they were the embodiment to me of a, of a National Park 
Service family. So, and, you know, you don’t ever lose some of that.  
 
BB: Right.  
 
BW: You know, it just, it doesn’t ever go away.  
 
BB: What do you, do you have hopes for the, the park service? You know, you leave 
with, with, I’m sure it’s, like you said, it’s kind of bittersweet, and you have, you have 
all the good memories. What would you, what are your hopes and, what would be 
your hope or your dream for Mammoth, let’s just use Mammoth Cave, for, for park 
workers, and how might it spin out into the future with, with your hope? 
 
BW: I hope that it’s always a, a pleasant place for people to come, and for whatever 
reason they’re there for, to find, to find that. I’ve got a friend that is always saying I, 
she’s never seen, she grew up in the city, and she’s always said, “I’ve never seen a 
waterfall. I’d love to go see a waterfall somewhere.” She lives close by. You know, I 
hope it’s a waterfall for somebody. I hope it’s a, it’s a first time experience with 
seeing a flat hat, and that the person wearing that flat hat is nice to them, and that 
they have a very positive experience out of, out of that. And I just hope it’s, you 
know, just a positive, happy place for, for somebody to, to go and learn, and, and that 
that resource, that precious resource is so protected. You know, it’s a tough place to 
protect, because it’s not just within the boundaries. Not, not that any national park is 
just within the boundaries. But the vast majority of what influences that precious 
resource is really outside. It’s the sinkhole plain. It’s all the, the railroad, I-65, it’s all 
the corridors, and stuff, you know, that carry so much stuff that can do such 
dastardly damage to it in, in a short period of time. And, and Mammoth Cave has 
been excellent at building up great partnerships through Western’s help, you know, 
the, the whole cave land environmental authority thing, the whole regional service 
system really came out of support for Mammoth Cave National Park. And never 
would, probably never would have happened without that, so I just hope that 
precious resource is protected and, and that people are still able to go there and 
have their positive experiences with interacting with that environment for whatever 
reason, whether it’s to see a waterfall or to hear a bird sing or whatever it is, so.  
 
BB: Exactly. That’s great. Do you have any, we’ve covered some ground. Do you have 
anything? I think you may have mentioned at the beginning before we started 
interviewing that you have a story. Is there something you wanted to share, because, 
you know, I, I’m grateful that you’re here with me, that I’m here at your home, to be 
able to share your experience, and this collective interview project has really shed 
light on so many things. Is there anything that, you know, you’d like to, to say, or, or 
to tell me a certain thing, or— 
 
BW: Well, I probably said, said as much, I, I’m, [0:55:00] I am an emotional person as 
is obvious. You know, I have, I’m not quite as bad as the Speaker of the House, but I, 
you know, I kind of like him in a sense. You know, I feel, I feel a great deal of, I 
identify with him a lot, you know, because you’re kind of going into a serious subject 
matter in some way, and then you end up all emotional and I don’t, I don’t know why 
that happens, but I guess, you know, it’s a profession, but it also becomes so 
personal to you, and it’s both the personal that makes it good, and it’s the personal 
that makes it hard. You know, there’s, there’s one line that’s always quoted from 
“The League of Their Own,” about there’s no crying in baseball. But the line I really 
like the best is when the, Dottie starts to leave to go out wherever it is, you know, to 
get married, and, and she tells the Tom Hanks character that it’s, it’s just too hard. 
And he says, “Hard is what makes it good.” And, and the park service is not easy. You 
know, to, I was, I remember it now. It was Denny Galvin, when he retired, that said 
that the park service was not always fun, or not always pleasure, but it was always a 
privilege. You know the park service is not easy, but it’s not always the easy that 
makes it good. It’s the hard that makes it good.  
 
BB: Thank you.  
 
BW: Thank you, sir.  
 
[INTERRUPTION—RECORDING STOPS] 
 
BW: In New Orleans, I know I loaded up, I had, I’d always driven Volkswagens, and 
so he helped me load up my, my, I think I had a ’74 Super Beetle at that time, and it 
was dragging the ground with stuff, you know, of trying to get to, to New Orleans for 
my first permanent job at the National Park Service. And he just said, he said, it was 
a couple stories about Daddy, said, “Just,” said, “Just go down there and take each 
day as it comes, and don’t look back.” You know, just don’t look back over your 
shoulder to us. Just, just go down there and do what you need to do, for as long as 
you need to do it. And, let’s see, how old, my dad was born in 1906, so at ‘83, he 
would have been, what, 77 years old? Is my math right on that? 
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
BW: And he was always kind of the, I don’t know, strong farmer kind of guy that 
would never show you any kind of emotion, much. You know, he was, I don’t want to 
say emotionless, but he, he was, you know, he was, you know, in the Lincoln movie, 
Lincoln talks about his dad not, not teaching him kindness. He had to learn that from 
somebody else. And maybe that’s true about my dad too. Maybe it’s true about men 
of several generations. And so I never really saw him cry, or saw him emotional, or, 
or anything like that. But at 77, my mother would have been 74, they wanted to 
drive their old Chevrolet down to New Orleans to see where I lived and where I 
worked and all that. And of course, I was scared to death. It’s like, good Lord, you 
know, there were a million and a half folks in the greater New Orleans area. You’re 
used to driving in rural Tennessee and you’re going to drive your, your old Chevy 
down here to where I’m living and working, but they made it. They made it fine, but 
as, as they got ready to leave and go back to Tennessee, it was the first time I’d really 
seen my dad cry, you know.  
 
BB: Because he was so proud of what you had accomplished? 
 
BW: He was proud, and he didn’t want to leave me. And I never knew that up to that 
point.  
 
BB: That’s beautiful.  
 
BW: So it was, it was a revelation in a family way, you know, that, that he loved me 
enough to—and I knew he loved me, but I, you know, if you don’t see guys cry, it 
will, except for me, I leave handkerchiefs all the time, but, but, but they came back to 
Tennessee, and I eventually came back to Kentucky. And I have loved this place. And 
I still do.  
 
BB: Yeah. And he was so proud of you. I mean, just, and that’s probably influenced 
your thoughts about your whole career, because— 
 
BW: Oh yeah. I mean, and, and you know, growing up in the environment that 
became Percy Priest Lake, and having the family farm lost, and losing all that, that 
stuff, and, and sort of could have had a real negative view of the government out of 
that, and a real negative view of people in flat hats, but you know, I even, I can 
halfway tolerate the Corps of Engineers now, you know. Don’t particularly like them, 
but I can at least tolerate them. So.  
 
BB: Right.  
 
BW: But I certainly love the National Park Service.  
 
BB: That’s great.
