Finding Roots: Asian American Farmers in Contemporary America 
Leslie Wiser 
February 17, 2021 
Interview conducted by Katelyn Reuther 
Leslie Wiser is the founder and owner of Radical Family Farms in Sebastopol, California. 
This was a 
remote interview conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Leslie Wiser joined the 
interview from Sebastopol, California, and Katie Reuther joined from Boston, Massachusetts. 
Interview Log

Introductions 
00:00:29 
Leslie describes her family's food culture when she was growing up. She is a 
child of immigrants on both sides. Her mother, from Taiwan, came over when she 
was twenty-four years old. Her father came to the U.S. from Germany when he 
was around ten. Leslie grew up eating regular American food. Her mom used the 
cookbook, Pei Mei's Chinese Cook Book, Volume I, as a 
guide for cooking some 
of her ancestral foods when Leslie was growing up. However, because they were 
living in the Midwest, their access to Chinese ingredients was limited until they 
moved to Cleveland, Ohio. There, Leslie's mom had access to an Asian plaza, a 
market, a 
dim sum place, and a 
community inaccessible to her in Minnesota. 
Leslie grew up eating the mix of foods her mom made, including American food, 
Chinese food, and her dad's favorite European dishes. 
When Leslie was around fifteen or sixteen years old, she went to live with her 
German/Polish Jewish grandparents in Indianapolis, Indiana. That experience had 
a 
significant impact on how she sees the importance of having access to your 
cultural foods and ingredients and keeping recipes and foods alive within your 
family. Through assimilation, both sides of Leslie's family lost so much coming to 
this country. 
00:03:03 
When she was younger, Leslie had no idea about the cultural aspects of the food 
she was eating, or the connection to her heritage that it was providing. She grew 
up a 
very confused person. She didn't start putting things together until, in her 
early twenties, she went to live with her Chinese grandparents in Taiwan for three 
months. She had never met them and wanted to learn more about her Taiwanese

side. Although they didn't share a 
common language and couldn't speak to each 
other, they took care of her through food. 
00:03:55 
Living with her grandparents in Taiwan gave Leslie a 
window into a 
whole 
other side of her and her mother's life that she didn't fully understand or have 
access to. She wanted to understand her family's history during the civil war and 
Japanese occupation of China, how they ended up in Taiwan, and how her mother 
came to the U.S. Leslie's mother was the first in her family to come to the U.S. 
and acted as the anchor to bring over her siblings. She sacrificed a 
great deal, 
including her own heritage, by marrying Leslie's father to be able to bring over 
her siblings. 
00:05:15 
Leslie discusses how living with each set of grandparents has shaped her. First 
and foremost, she loves old people because of her time with them. When she saw 
the attacks on the elderly in San Francisco's Chinatown areas, she was 
heartbroken. Due to her Chinese cultural values and her experiences living with 
both sides of grandparents, she has a 
great respect for elders. She says this doesn't 
seem like a 
shared American value. 
When Leslie was around sixteen, she went to live with her German/Polish Jewish 
grandparents in Indianapolis. It was a 
life-saving event for her. Leslie is one of 
five kids, and because her parents were working a 
lot to try and make ends meet, 
they weren't able to be there all the time. She fell through the cracks, and she 
needed that one-on-one attention from her grandparents in Indiana to be able to 
thrive. 
Leslie attributes much of who she is and her values to her time living with that set 
of grandparents. Sitting around the table at dinner, her grandparents would talk to 
her about their history before and during World War II. Hearing about their stories 
had a 
significant impact on Leslie, who believes in learning your family history so 
mistakes won't be repeated in the future. All of their struggles have shaped who 
she is as a 
person today. 
Leslie's grandmother was always bemoaning that there were no good bakeries in 
their area. Every time she would go to a 
major metropolitan area, she would look 
for Polish and German bakeries, marzipan, and German grocery stores. She has 
Hungarian, Polish, and German influence, and she tried to keep a 
lot of that alive 
for herself and Leslie's grandfather through her cooking. When she passed away 
this year, Leslie made sure to get her Polish, German, and Hungarian cookbooks 
and note down which recipes were important to her so she could cook them 
herself. That was very significant for Leslie and brought some awareness about 
the process of immigration to this country and the loss of cultural heritage as 
viewed from her grandparents' side.

She also experienced this with her mother growing up. As a 
young child, Leslie's 
family would get together with her mother's siblings and their families after they 
came to the U.S. They would have big family gatherings periodically and order 
Kentucky Fried Chicken. Her mom and siblings would speak Chinese, but the 
kids would all speak English. 
When she went to live with her Chinese grandparents in Taiwan, that was a 
whole 
other side of her family history that she didn't know about. It was the Sino-
Japanese War side. Living with her grandparents in Indianapolis, she learned 
about the European World War II, the Holocaust, and their effects on her German 
grandfather and her displaced, half-Jewish grandmother. 
In Taiwan, and then in Cupertino where Leslie did a 
full interview with them, she 
learned about her grandparents' experiences during the Sino-Japanese War. She 
learned about running from the Japanese, the bombing, how the Japanese lost, the 
civil war between Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong, and Chiang Kai-shek's loss 
and escape to Taiwan. Then there was everything that happened in Taiwan after 
Kai-shek's arrival on the island, including the White Terror and martial law. 
Leslie's grandfather was in Kai-shek's army. 
00:12:12 
When Leslie went to Taiwan, she would go with her grandmother every day to the 
market to buy fresh meat and produce. She recalls a 
time at the market when her 
grandmother selected a 
chicken, and the vendor slit its throat before throwing 
it into a 
barrel where it bled out and died. Every morning, they would walk to a 
cook on the street who only made rou geng mi fen. They would get soup in a 
bag and have it for breakfast back at their house. Ron geng is a 
popular pork stew 
in Taiwan. 
Because they couldn't communicate, Leslie's grandmother signed her up for 
Mandarin lessons. She went by herself by bus to the Mandarin Daily News for 
classes. On the way there, they would stop at the bao (
bun) vendor, and Leslie 
would get pork buns for breakfast. 
She could only get a 
thirty-day visa, so she flew to Thailand twice to visit her 
aunt, who married a 
Thai man in Bangkok. When she was in Taiwan with her 
grandparents, it was during the Lunar New Year. At that time, she had no idea 
what was happening, because she couldn't speak the language. She learned most 
of her Mandarin from her Thai uncle, who spoke broken Mandarin and broken 
English. When he was in Taiwan, he helped explain what was going on, but after 
he went back to Thailand, she was lost. That was her first experience with 
Chinese New Year. She didn't fully understand any of the things that were 
happening, and she remained a 
removed observer of something that should've 
been her cultural heritage.

Until she started the farm in 2019 and met a 
community of Asian Americans who 
are all on the same mission of reclaiming their culture through produce and 
heritage cooking, Leslie had no idea how significant Lunar New Year was. She 
thinks about how her mom came to the U.S. at twenty-four and gave it all up. 
Lunar New Year is a 
time to be reunited with family and to cook your foods, but 
she doesn't have any memory of doing that as a 
child. 
Knowing what she knows now, having to give all of that up is a 
huge crime. She 
has a 
great deal of empathy for her mom. In Taiwan, her mom was surrounded by 
a 
large family, friends, and a 
big community, but when she came here alone and 
met and married Leslie's dad, she was very isolated. 
In addition, this country is very independent, and you have to be the individual. 
This is a 
completely different mindset than where Leslie's mom came from as a 
young adult. Leslie isn't sure her mom fully understood that she would be a 
minority in this country when she came. In addition, an interracial marriage in the 
early 1970s wasn't that common, especially in the Midwest. 
00:19:43 
Living with her German/Polish grandparents influenced Leslie's decision to get 
into farming. She majored in dietetics at Indiana University, but it wasn't really 
what she wanted. At that time, she couldn't vocalize or identify her connection 
with food, but she knew it was more of a 
sociological or anthropological 
connection. Where she ended up studying, it was all science and nutrition-based. 
She was privileged enough to attend an outdoor canoeing camp throughout high 
school, so she knew the importance of food and nourishment and saw how it 
brings people together. Around that time, she also worked at a 
farm in Alaska. 
When she thought of farmers, she thought of the small family farm with the white 
guys who look like Jesus. She worked on the farm for one summer, but she didn't 
really connect with it and couldn't see a 
viable career path. She thinks her 
inability to connect with it was due in large part to the fact that she never saw 
anyone like her farming. 
00:22:22 
Leslie's last experience with summer canoeing during high school was in the 
Northwest Territories. After observing how food can bring people together, she 
wanted to have that experience again. She loved the Northwest Territories and 
found the farming job in Alaska through ATTRA (Appropriate Technology 
Transfer for Rural Areas). 
The one class Leslie took in Indiana that spoke to her was called The Biology of 
Food, taught by Marti Crouch. Dr. Crouch talked about the horrific, giant 
agricultural systems in this country and their environmental impacts. Leslie 
Leslie Wiser Interview Log, February 17, 2021

specifically remembers learning about dairy farming, Monsanto, and Roundup. 
Dr. Crouch told Leslie about ATTRA and got her a 
list of internships and jobs 
around the country. Leslie picked the one in Alaska. She says she thinks she got 
the job because she's used to being around children. She spent most of her time 
there taking care of and hanging out with the owners' two small children. 
00:25:06 
The farm in Alaska was a 
sustainable, ten-acre farm. They grew typical 
Eurocentric vegetables and specialized in basil. This had a 
big influence on 
Leslie, and she now grows many different varieties of basil on her farm. They also 
grew flowers mainly for the pollinators and beneficial insects for their IPM 
(Integrated Pest Management) program. That led Leslie to grow flowers on her 
own farm. 
00:26:33 
Leslie says she probably didn't have any impression of farming after her 
experience in Alaska, because she forgot she even did it. She didn't feel like she 
could farm. When the farmer told her how much money it was to buy their land, 
she thought she could never do it. 
00:27:12 
When Leslie went to Taiwan, she had dropped out of school because she was so 
disgusted with the dietetic and nutrition science program. No one knew she had 
dropped out of school when she went, but luckily her grandparents let her stay 
with them after they found out. 
She became more interested in photography, design, and commercial design, and 
started shooting photographs of her grandparents and her time in Taiwan. She 
loaded up on graphic design, commercial design, and photography courses to 
graduate from school with a 
General Studies degree. She continued on to get a 
Media Arts and Sciences master's degree. Her capstone centered around her 
Chinese grandparents' history, specifically focusing on their time living in China 
during the Japanese invasion and occupation. To make her capstone documentary, 
she stayed with her uncle and grandparents in Cupertino for a 
few months. 
From there, she went with her media arts and science experience to work for 
digital media and advertising companies. She then had her own digital advertising 
and media company before having her kids. Like farming, digital media 
production is a 
lifestyle. Leslie was doing a 
lot of 3D work, spending eleven or 
twelve hours in front of a 
computer. After having her kids, she reflected on her 
experience in Alaska and how they raised their kids. She wanted to try and create 
that for her kids, and she wanted them to know where their food comes from. 
Leslie didn't know until she worked on that farm. It gave her a 
huge respect for 
where food comes from, and she wanted to make sure her kids had that. 
Leslie Wiser Interview Log, February 17, 2021

After having her kids, she stopped working to take care of them. She then moved 
from Indiana to Cleveland to California, all the while looking for farmland to 
raise the kids and have a 
family. She ended up having to get a 
divorce, and 
because she was married to a 
woman living in Ohio, she had to go to a 
different 
state to get the divorce. On her way to get a 
divorce in Washington, she stopped in 
California and ended up staying due to family and social connections. 
00:33:06 
Farming in Sonoma County in California is extremely expensive, and it's not 
something she could personally afford. She is very privileged to have the support 
of her family, who helped her purchase a 
place to farm and provided stable 
housing for her kids. She doesn't take that lightly, so she tries to make the most of 
the privileges she does have to work with a 
community of queer Asian 
Americans. 
It took Leslie two years of actively looking to find land in Sonoma County. She 
was finally able to secure a 
place in 2018, and that fall, they cover cropped the 
whole acre and a 
quarter to acre and a 
half that's being farmed. They went to 
Taiwan, and when they came back, the cover crop was lush. Leslie didn't know 
anything about don miao (
pea shoots) being such a 
significant Chinese crop, but 
she somehow made the connection and started selling it on social media. 
00:35:51 
It was a 
long process to get the farm going (over five years). In that time, Leslie 
started reading books and subscribing to magazines. In Sonoma County, she did 
the Master Gardener course, in addition to taking sustainable agriculture classes at 
the junior college there. She did everything she could to fill herself with as much 
knowledge as possible. She looked into the University of California Santa Cruz's 
apprenticeship program, but she couldn't do it because she had kids. Working on 
another farm with children also wasn't an option. Working on the farm in Alaska 
for one season, reading books, and gaining educational knowledge was all she 
could do to prepare for her own farm. 
00:37:42 
It was scary for Leslie starting her own farm without very much practical 
experience. However, she says she was so ignorant that her ignorance helped her. 
Knowing what she knows now going into her third season, she would be too 
scared to start a 
farm without the experience. Leslie relied heavily on the methods 
she found in a 
Master Gardener book, especially the no-till permanent bed system. 
She also saw a 
lot of no-till permanent beds in Taiwan, and she took a 
few 
workshops at the no-till farm Singing Frogs Farm. 
Usually when you farm, you have customers lined up. Leslie didn't have any 
customers. She just planted everything she wanted to plant. At the time, she asked 
her German/Polish side and her Chinese side what crops and vegetables they 
wished they had access to when they came to this country. On her Chinese side, 
Leslie Wiser Interview Log, February 17, 2021 
6 
her cousin compiled a 
list and sent it to her, which turned into her seeding list. 
Her Polish/German grandmother gave her a 
list of everything she wanted and 
wished she had access to, and Leslie planted that. She did it with no customers in 
mind. 
Thankfully, it all started with the pea shoots, and they led to the direction of the 
farm. They're mainly growing Asian and Chinese vegetables, including many 
Southeast Asian herb varieties. Leslie also planted currants, European 
gooseberries, and green sorrel for her grandmother. Their CSA (Community 
Supported Agriculture) members will get random crops that are not Asian or 
Chinese in any way. They try to make it clear that it's not solely Asian vegetables, 
but a 
mixed Asian vegetable farm. They also grow kale, beets, and zucchini, 
because she knows they will yield well. A 
lot of the Asian vegetables are 
heirloom, so Leslie tries to buy some hybrids for their yield and disease 
resistance. 
00:42:02 
Leslie gets most of her seeds from Kitazawa Seed Company in Oakland, 
California. She also gets a 
lot of seeds from Johnny's to try some of their Asian 
crops, as well as from the Seed Savers Exchange. 
00:42:55 
Leslie says the book, The Chinese Kitchen Garden, has been very helpful for 
learning about Asian vegetables. The writer talks about her father's garden and 
how he cultivates it. He uses traditional Chinese methods to create deep, 
permanent beds. The author also discusses how to grow, what seasons to grow in, 
and how to prepare the vegetables for cooking. 
Leslie learns through trial and error. She applies the knowledge she gained from 
her experience in Alaska and the classes she took to her own farm. A 
lot of the 
varieties, like cucumber and eggplant, are just Asian varieties, so specialized 
knowledge is not necessarily required. 
She grows things in five or six different places, so if things are taken out in one 
area, she also has them somewhere else. By planting them in different locations, 
she's also testing to see how they grow in one place or another. Their fields look 
very different than if you're tractor farming. They don't have super long rows of 
one crop. In one row, they might have two or three different crops, in addition to 
flowers. 
00:45:19 
Going in, Leslie wanted to do a 
CSA. She liked the diversification at Singing 
Frogs Farm and at the farm she worked on in Alaska. They have a 
CSA, 
restaurant accounts, wholesale, and sell at the farmers market. That's what Leslie 
did in 2019, but in 2020, a 
lot of the restaurants dropped off due to the pandemic. 
Leslie Wiser Interview Log, February 17, 2021

For Leslie, the farmers market is hard. Many of the crops she grows are very 
personal, and not everyone knows the story behind the farm. People say "it's too 
expensive," "it's gross," or they just walk away. In addition, Leslie's farm isn't 
certified organic, and they haven't built up the credibility at the market they were 
going to. In 2019, they sold at a 
chef's market, where the chefs would place their 
orders beforehand and pick up the produce at the market. People walking by the 
table wouldn't know what anything was, and then they would see Leslie, who 
doesn't present as Asian. If they do the farmers market, Leslie would have to hire 
someone to do it for them. 
In 2020, they shifted to ninety-five percent CSA. She likes that, because she 
wants to feed families and as many people as they possibly can. A 
lot of their 
customers are immigrants and children of immigrants who are on the same 
journey she is. They are learning about their cultural heritage through food and 
cooking, and they want access to sustainably grown, non-GMO (genetically-
modified organism), no-spray, chemical-free Asian produce. 
00:48:39 
The exchanges Leslie has with customers are always exchanges of food. When 
she delivers CSA boxes at drop points, she's always given food. Leslie doesn't 
cook a 
lot, but she gets to eat what everyone else is cooking with the produce she 
grows. 
One of her customers and friends, Henry, is also Taiwanese. His mother was 
always talking about this flat, Taiwanese cabbage, and when Leslie saw it in 
Taiwan, she decided to grow it. She found the seed through Kitazawa, and it grew 
into a 
tender, sweet cabbage that's used in baos or for quick Taiwanese kimchi or 
pickles. 
Henry came to Leslie's booth at the farmers market in Marin to buy these flat 
cabbages that had so much significance to his family and his mother. He has 
taught Leslie a 
lot about Taiwanese food culture. His family has been in Taiwan 
for generations, whereas Leslie's family came over in 1949. There is a 
lot of 
struggling to understand the political dynamics there with everything that has 
happened. 
Leslie didn't fully understand that a 
lot of the Chinese vegetables in the United 
States are called by their Cantonese names. It's been an eye-opening experience. 
She has been trying to hone in on the Mandarin and call the vegetables by their 
Mandarin names. 
Usually around this time (February), they're in Taiwan. In 2020, they were in 
Taiwan just before the pandemic hit. After her first year of farming in 2019, she 
actually knew what the vegetables were at the night market and on the streets. She 
Leslie Wiser Interview Log, February 17, 2021 
8 
could call them by their names in Mandarin, and people could understand her. It's 
had a 
huge influence on the development of her Chinese side. 
It's done the same for her kids. They've tried ku gua (
bitter melon). Her kids are 
also Korean, so she grows quite a 
few Korean crops to have a 
better 
understanding of that part of them. They grow perilla from Kristyn Leach at 
Namu Farm, as well as her gold cucumbers. 
The whole farm is Leslie putting her identity first and foremost, and trying to 
learn more about the things they lost within just one generation. With the 
migration and fleeing from mainland China to Taiwan, there was the loss of a 
lot 
of culture and foods with her grandparents and mom growing up. Her 
grandparents always wanted to go back to mainland China, but they never could. 
Her Chinese grandmother was always bemoaning how she had no home or 
no place. 
00:56:14 
Leslie is tall and white-presenting, so she has some "privilege" there. She doesn't 
see it as a 
privilege, though, because she's sort of in-between, belonging to 
nobody. Throughout her farming journey, there haven't been a 
lot of challenges 
that she attributes to her racial or ethnic identity, which has been surprising for 
her. Being very clear about their values for social, racial, and queer justice has 
repelled the people that would create problems for them and attracted people with 
similar shared values. Leslie feels very lucky for that. 
00:57:33 
Sarah Deragon is Leslie's partner in the farm and in life. She's a 
professional 
photographer, and she is very much a 
city girl. She had no idea what it meant 
when Leslie said she wanted to farm and be a 
farmer. Sarah came into their lives 
about four years ago and is the step-parent to their kids. 
When they first started in 2019, Sarah was working five or six days a 
week in the 
city doing photography. It was really because of Sarah's presence in the city that 
they were able to create customer connections and do those deliveries. Before a 
photo shoot, Sarah would deliver don miao to some of their first customers. 
Without that, Leslie says she doesn't think the farm would be where it is now. It's 
hard logistically to be away from the farm for that long to make deliveries. 
When the pandemic hit in 2020, all of Sarah's photography business stopped. It 
wasn't good for their family income, Sarah's income, or her identity as a 
person, 
but it did allow her to work on the farm more. Farming with your partner is hard. 
It's an adjustment. Economically, you make a 
higher salary as an individual 
professional than you do farming at a 
small scale like they are. They're lucky that 
they were able to be profitable in their second year. The first year they were not. A 
lot of money went into infrastructure development at the beginning. 
Leslie Wiser Interview Log, February 17, 2021 
9 
Farming with a 
partner is a 
blessing, but it can also be very hard. It's very 
stressful, and they're always together. Sarah has been Leslie's number one support 
with the farm, and she has helped especially with the deliveries. 
1:01:28 
As a 
farmer now, the Asian American community (immigrants or children of 
immigrants) is critical for Leslie. They feel the same sense of loss and are clinging 
to their identity and heritage to fight the assimilative forces of America and white 
supremacy. The queer community has also been important in Leslie's farming 
journey. She notes that there are many non-Asian people who support the farm, 
because they like its social justice stance. 
1:02:38 
Leslie discusses some of the biggest takeaways from her first few years of 
farming. First, farming is very expensive. You have to be in a 
privileged position 
to even farm, and she doesn't think it should be that way. She says it's not 
accidental. It's by design. It's about land access and inequity. She also started 
farming when she was forty-two years old. Because her body is ruined after only 
two years, she emphasizes getting into farming when you're young. Lastly, she 
says that something has to be done for land access and equity, especially so 
farmers of color and Black and Indigenous farmers can have access to land. 
1:04:36 
Last year, they had quite a 
large crew of people working on the farm. Farming in 
the way that she farms requires a 
lot of people and human power. She loved the 
people that were working on their farm. It created a 
dynamic community of 
mostly queer people of color, and she hopes to do that for the 2021 season. One of 
her goals as a 
business owner and farmer is to keep the crew employed throughout 
the year. Generally in farming, people are hired seasonally and then they're gone. 
She sees value in building long-term relationships with her crew and employees 
and giving them opportunities for growth. In the future, Leslie would like to 
explore different models for structuring the farm, such as adding people to the 
LLC (limited liability company) or creating a 
worker-owned co-op. 
She says you can't farm alone. Leslie thought she could do the whole farm by 
herself in 2019. Luckily, Sarah was there to help out in her time off, and Leslie 
was able to hire someone periodically at the end of the season. Having to hire 
other people is expensive. You have to pay them (hopefully) more than minimum 
wage. 
One of the biggest challenges Leslie faces is the expectation that all Asian or 
Chinese vegetables should be cheap. Leslie's produce is not cheap. They can't be 
cheap. They wouldn't be able to survive in this economic landscape farming the 
way they do without chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides to increase their 
yields. They have lost many customers who expect them to be cheap. 
Leslie Wiser Interview Log, February 17, 2021

1:08:09 
To be anti-racist, you have to be constantly evaluating yourself Leslie is always 
thinking about that, evaluating herself, and checking herself. The racial uprisings 
that took place in the wake of George Floyd's death last summer didn't create any 
major changes for them at the farm. They've had those values on the farm from 
the beginning and those lived values as people. This has allowed them to attract 
the crew and customers they want surrounding the farm. 
1:09:50 
On a 
broader scale across the food system, something has to be done about the 
inequities of land access so that we can have more farmers of color out there. On 
her farm, Leslie would like to explore doing some kind of worker-owned 
cooperative or amend the LLC to add owners or additional managers. In terms of 
food access, she wants to expand their direct-to-home delivery capabilities, 
especially for elderly, disabled, or immunocompromised CSA members. 
Leslie is looking into the possibility of them becoming fiscally sponsored so they 
can get larger donations for a 
food access fund. She's referencing the model they 
have at Rock Steady Farm in New York. Rock Steady has a 
fiscal sponsor, and 
they are able to get grants and large donations to feed a 
community of people who 
might not otherwise have equitable access to food. Leslie applied for a 
grant to 
support their direct-to-home delivery, and they got it last week. They'll be 
partnering with community organizations within Oakland Chinatown to locate 
seniors in need. Some of the seniors are already getting access to fresh produce 
that's delivered to their homes, but it's not culturally relevant. Leslie wants to be 
able to provide culturally relevant food to their elders. 
1:13:46 
Leslie advises other people of color who are trying to get into farming to farm 
with a 
group of people that share similar values. Don't think that you can do it all 
by yourself. Leslie has a 
good business, project management, and marketing 
background, but not everyone has that. You need to have a 
diversified team so that 
you're not managing everything at once. Starting a 
farm needs to be a 
community-based initiative. If you're able to acquire or take over a 
farm where 
the infrastructure is already in place, that would be the best. Starting something 
from scratch requires too much money. Leslie thinks farming should be valued 
more, but as things are, you don't make very much money.
