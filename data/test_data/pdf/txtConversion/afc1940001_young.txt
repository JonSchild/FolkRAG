Fair Charlotte Fair Charlotte lived on a mountain side, in a wild and lonely spot; Not another dwelling
for three miles round except her father's cot. And yet on many a rainy night young swains would
gather there, For her father kept a social board and she was very fair. All in the village some fifteen
miles, there was a ball one night, And though the air was very cold, young hearts were warm and
light. Her eager looks and trembling hands when a well-known voice she heard, As driving up to the
cottage door, Charles Lesley did appear! Her mother said, "My daughter dear, this blanket round you
fold, The air is very cold tonight, you'll take your death of cold." But, "No, no," fair Charlotte cried,
and she laughed like a gypsy queen. "To ride in a blanket muffled up, I never would be seen. "My
satin coat is quite enough; you know it's lined throughout. Besides I have a silken scarf to tie my neck
about." Her bonnet and her gloves were on, she jumped into the sleigh, And o'er the fields by the
mountain side, and o'er the hills away. There's music in the sound of bells as o'er the fields they go.
What a cracking noise the runners make as they bite the frozen snow. They rode along in silence
until five long miles were past. Charles Lesley spoke these frozen words and stillness broke at last.
Said Charlie, "It is very cold tonight; the lines I scarce can hold." Then Charlotte spoke in a feeble
voice, "I am exceeding cold." He cracked his whip and urged his horse much faster than before, And
five more of these dreary miles in silence they passed o'er. Said Charles, "How fast the frozen frost
has gathered on my brow!" And Charlotte spoke, but very low, "I am growing warmer now." They
rode along through the cold frosty air, also the cold starlight. And at last they reached the village
inn, and the ballroom was in sight. Charles Lesley sprang out of th/e sleigh and offered up his hand.
"Why sit you there like a monument that has no power to stand?" He asked her once, he asked her
twice, but she said not a word; He asked her for her hand again, but still she never stirred. 2 2 of 2
Fair Charlotte He tore the mantle from her brow, the cold stars on her shone, And quickly right into
the light, a lifeless corpse was borne. They tried all that was in their means her life for to restore, But
Charlotte was a frozen corpse, she never spoke no more. He looked at her so wistfully and kissed her
marble brow, And his thoughts went back to the place where she said, "I am growing warmer now."
He took her up into his arms, and with her he drove home. A dreadful sight for her parents' eyes,
and how they wept and mourned! © They mourned the loss of their daughter dear, Charles Lesley
mourned her doom, Until his tender heart did break; now they slumber in one tomb.

swains was gathered there Her [father kept?] social board And she was very fair. One New Year's Eve
as the sun went down Far looked her wistful eye As through the frosty window pane As the merry
sleighs dashed by. At the village fifteen miles away Was to be a ball that night Although the air was
freezing cold Her heart was warm and light. How bright beamed her laughing eye As a well-known
voice she heard And dashing up to ther father's door Her lover's sleigh appeared. "Oh daughter
dear," the mother said "This blanket round you fold For 'tis a dreadful night abroad You'll catch your
death of cold." "Oh nay, Oh nay," young Charlotte said And she laughed like a gypsy queen "To ride in
blankets all muffled up I never would be seen." Her bonnet and her cloak was on [She?] got into the
sleigh And down the mountain side they sped And over the hills away. With muffled [ drums ? beats
?] so silently At last five miles were passed And Charles with few and shivering words The silences
broke at last. "Such a dreadful night I never saw My reins I scarce can hold." It was then fair Charlotte
did reply "I am exceeding cold." He popped his whip, he urges his steed Much faster than before
Until five other dreary miles In silence was passed o'er. Young Charlotte Cont'd Spoke Said? "Oh
Charles, " how fast the freezing ice Is a-gathering on my brow. 'Twas then young Charlotte did reply "I
am growing warmer now." And so they speed[ ? ] through the frosty night And the glittering star light
Until at last a village lamp And the ballroom hove in sight. They reached the door and Charles sprang
out He reached his hands to her "Why sit ye there like a monument That has no power to stir?" He
took her hand in his, 'twas cold And as hard as any stone. He tore the mantle from her brow And the
cold stars o'er her shone. Thus quickly to the lighted hall Her lifeless form he bore Saying, Oh my
dearest darling, You never more shall know." And there he knelt down by her side And kissed her
marble brow And his thoughts went back to where she said "I am growing warmer now. [Mrs.?] Wells
