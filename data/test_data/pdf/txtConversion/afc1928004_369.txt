TO THE READER. 
IN presenting my SONG Booic to the Public—in which I 
offer 
only a 
few of my own poor productions—I 
am in duty bound to 
say that I 
am but the " gatherer and disposer of other men's stuff." 
Had I 
made 
song writing" a 
specialty in my youth, 1 
might per-
haps by this time have been abie to have ia id in a 
supply, if not 
beneficial to others, one that might at least have been good enough 
for my own puri,ose. 
But I 
have selected from the best authors 
the songs I 
think most caleulatol to suit a 
cultivated mind. 
Yet I 
should have felt better pleased ill offering it to the public had it 
contained mole of my own mat'er; but the fault I 
must confess is 
more my own than nature's; for, from my boyhood, my love for 
writing songs, love stories, or rhyme was not so strong as my love 
for travel. 
The novel sight was the novel into %which I,pould throw 
all my attention, and from the first day that I 
appeared on the 
great stage of nature to act my par . the most pleasing reeollec1ons 
that I 
can churn up are founded on some incident of travel. When 
I 
was a 
boy I 
heard peopie say that " a 
rolling stone gathers no 
moss;" bat the stone that is perpetually rolling is not so apt to get 
rusty as the one that lies by the fence for year.. Now I 
am proud 
to acknowledge that I 
am a 
perfect roiling stone—a 
kind of " Will 
of the Wisp" fellow—a 
bail of human quicksilver—one who is 
never satisfied anywhere unless'he is going somewhere else. 
And 
yet I 
am happy; aye, indeed, richer, by the store of travel I 
have 
taken in than were I 
a 
millionaire and been tied to a 
cow's tail all 
my life. 
And in my trip of once and half around the world Dame 
Nature seems to have furnished me with the commodity most es-
sential to a 
traveller, and one she seems to bestow most on us Irish-
men— A. LIGHT HEART. 
Even at this advanced period my admira-
tion for sight- eeing is so strong that if modern invention can ar-
range an excursion to the moon on a 
flash of forked lightning I 
should be one of the first to take the trip. 
To change a 
man's na-
ture is one of the hardest things in nature. 
He who has been where I 
have been, 
Or he who has seen what 1 
have seen, 
Must give man praise for all his skill, 
But acknowledge Nature the master still ; 
For all the wondro/L= wGrit's of art, 
And those yet in the genius mart. 
Are not one little ;:rain of sand 
Compared to the work of Nature's hand. 
—JanieS Cooke. 
And my nature is to travel, and since 18-19 I 
have done it to the 
Queen's taste. 
Since that time I 
have seen more of the world 
than any circus or showman on earth. 
I 
have plowed my way 
through fields and mountains of ice; have travelled over the bum-
TO THE READER.--Concluded. 
frig sands and deserts of Arabia and Algiers—over England, Ire-
land, Scotland, Orkney Islands, Isle of Man, Isle of Wight, Bel-
gium, France, Italy, Russia, Prussia' Austria, Egypt, India, China, 
Japan, Van Dieman's Land, New Zealand, Australia, Philippine 
Islands, Figi Islands, Society Islands, Sandwbich Islands, Califor-
nia, British Columbia, Canada, Prince Edward's Island, and the 
United States. 
Also many other places, which space will not per-
mit me to mention at present. 
I 
have stood the public brunt for 
many years, and have often been compelled to twist my 
little abil-
ity into many forms to suit the different audiences that I 
met with; 
discerning on many occasions that where they knew the least they 
were the hardest to please. 
It is no harder work to hew a 
tree 
down with a 
razor than to talk reason with a 
man who will under. 
stand no man's reason but his own. 
As a 
matter of course I 
have 
met with great success. 
Every great traveller and public man 
meets with that; well, we say so anyway. I 
put nothing in the 
bank when I 
started, and I 
have it there yet, with compound inter-
est. 
And I 
am very glad that I 
didn't bank myself. 
The press 
has been very kind to me throughout my long journey, and I'm 
sure I 
could fill a 
book ten times larger than this with their favor-
able opinions. 
But I 
shall have to decline making use of them for 
the pi esent. 
They will appear shortly in a 
work which shall con-
tain a 
minute detail of my trips, and in which I 
shall also publish 
my letters of recommendation from Members of Parliament, bish-
ops, clergy, and members of the royal family of England. 
I 
have done my best with adverse times to cope, 
Knowing the truth with good old Alec Pope— 
"honor and shame from no conditions rise; 
Act well your part—there all the honor lies. ,' 
I 
think I've acted mine free of craft or spells, 
More than a 
motley garb and cap and bells. 
I 
aim a 
shaft at folly and her train, 
Cautious that gentle minds receive no pain, 
And by my own or borrowed jest 
To heighten recreation, for ' tis best 
To season wisdom with some mental salt, 
And try to gnench the love or thirst for malt. 
He means well who in honest labor delves; 
Our faith is in our hope and in ourselves. 
I 
scorn the vulgar jibe or impious scoff— 
When that's preferred the motley cap I'll doff. 
—By James Cooke, Clown's Jester.), 
If my reader will now please turn over a 
new leaf he will find 
the material he paid for, as I 
charge nothing for this little infor-
mation.

THE T EcINGS I DOE 'T LIKE TO BEE. 
Written and Composed by .1AmEs COOKE. 
W HAT a 
queer set of people we are I 
declare— 
What one person likes another can't bear, 
But it was my plan, when I 
went to school, 
To like everything nice bite a 
good-natured bolt 
Some like to look thin, others like to look fat; 
Some like to see this and others like to see that. 
But, if you'll pay attention and listen to Me, 
I 
will tell you some things I 
don't like to see. 
cnonus. 
You may call me a 
fool, a 
gilley or guy, 
But some things appear very strange to the eye— 
You may like to see them, it's nothing to me; 
But I'll tell you the things that I 
don't like to see. 
I 
don't like to see a 
big boy ride a 
goat— 
Nor a 
man wipe his nose on the sleeve of his coat. 
I 
don't like to see folks in misery sunk— 
Nor I 
don't like to see a 
teetotaller drunk. 
I 
don't like to see homely women use paint— 
Nor a 
gray-headed sinner pretend he's a 
saint. 
I 
don't like to see folks to babies unkind— 
Nor ladies with thesses too much up behind_ 
You may call me, etc 
I 
don't like to see a 
smash-up on the cars— 
Nor children rude to their Ma's and their Pa's. 
I 
don't like to see folks in trouble and strife— 
Nor a 
man talking sweet to another man's wife. 
I 
don't like to see a 
politician, though great, 
Get into office and then rob the state. 
I 
don't like to see women wearing false hair— 
Nor that young man squeeze that girl over there. 
You may call me, etc. 
I 
don't like to see letters written in rhy me— 
Nor a 
girl have more than three beaux at a 
time. 
I 
don't like to see man and wife disagree— 
Nor people put gin 'stead of milk in their tea. 
I 
don't like to see a 
young man dress too loud— 
Nor those who have nothing he haughty and proud. 
I 
don't like to see a 
man live past, his means— 
Nor a 
hotel feed the boarders on nothing but beans. 
You may call me, etc. 
I 
don't like to see brothers go out to fight— 
Nor a 
husband stay out from his wife late at night. 
I 
don't like to see—though such it appe.ars— 
A man kill another and get only four years. 
I 
don't like to see poor old Title= kept down, 
Nor the sons of her soil be oppressed by a 
crown. 
If by peace or by wisdom she can get herself free, 
That's one of things we shall all like to see. 
You may call me, etc. 
THERE ARE NO TWO MEN ALIKE. 
Written and sung by Lulus COORZ, the Clown. 
Ts 
world's made up of every kind, 
And scarcely two alike you'll find; 
Go where you will, I 
still maintain 
You'll never meet two men the same; 
The material may be just the same, 
No difference in the creed or name— 
No matter where on earth you strike, 
You'll never see two men alike. 
CHORUS. 
So it's no use of people talking, 
Every cripple has his way of walking; 
On land or Safi, where'er you strike, 
You'll never meet two men alike. 
If one is short, the other's long, 
If one is weak, the other's strong, 
If one is young, the other's old, 
If one is hot, the other's cold, 
If one is quick, the other's lazy, 
If one is sane, the other's crazy, 
If one is swimming, the other's sinking, 
If one is eating, the other's drinking. 
So it's no uw, etc. 
If one is smooth, the other's rough, 
If one is tender, the other's tough, 
If one is well, the other's gouty, 
If one is pleased, the other's polity, 
If one is doubtful, the other's sure, 
If one is rich, the other's poor, 
(1) 
If one is good, the other's bad, 
If one is wise, the other's mad. 
So it's no use, etc. 
If one is in, the other's out, 
If one is thin, the other's stout, 
If one is short the other's tall, 
If one is big, the other's small, 
If one is laughing, the other's crying, 
If one is living, the other's dying: 
If one is wrong, the other's right, 
If one is hlack, the other's white. 
So it's no use, eta. 
If one is here, the other's there, 
If one is foul, the other's fair, 
If one is fat, the other's lean, 
If one is blue, the other's green, 
If one is selfish, the other's kind, 
If one is ahead, the other's behind, 
If one is warm, the other's cool, 
If one is wise, the other's a 
fool. 
So it's no use, eta. 
If one is crooked, the other's straight 
If one is nothing, the other's great, 
If one is high, the other's low, 
If one is quick, the other's slow, 
If one is flat, the other's broad, 
If one is square, the other's fraud, 
If one is gold, the other's brass, 
If one is a 
mule, the other's an ass. 
So it's no use, etc.

VAN DIEMAN'S LAND. 
The last three verses of this song written bytazs CoOM 
I 
HAD a 
dream the other night, 
I 
dreamed that I 
was free, 
I 
dreamed I 
was back in old Ireland, 
With Biddy on my knee; 
I 
dreamed I 
was back in old Ireland, 
With Biddy by the hand, but when I 
woke, 
Sure my poor heart was broke, 
I 
was still in Van Dieman's Laud-
I 
was banished from my happy home, 
From all that was dear to me, - 
I 
was banished because I 
joined the boys 
To set my country free; 
To give poor Ireland freedom 
I 
lent a 
helping hand; 
They sent me away acrost the sea, 
And I'm .now in Van Dieman's Land 
The day I 
left sweet Dublin Bay 
I 
never shall forget, 
The angry billows they did roar, 
And the rain came down so wet; 
The angry billows they did roar, 
As I 
waved to my friends my hand— 
Cheer up, says I, you need not cry, 
Though I 
am off to Van Dieman's Land. 
It's ten long years since last I 
looked 
On dear old Erin's shore, , 
But I 
won't despair, for I 
hope to see 
My native hills once more; 
For that time to come I 
often pray 
In my chains and iron band, 
I 
haven't forgot old Ireland, 
Though I'm. out in. Van Dieman's Land-
9 
THEY DON'T THINK OF THAT TILL THEY'RB 
OLD. 
Written by JAMES COOKE-
Ir I 
had my time to come over again, 
How often you'll hear a 
man say, 
I 
know I'd do better like other great men, 
I 
would think of a 
future day; 
His faults he'll admit have been very great, 
He has wasted his health and his gold, 
For the world will frown on a 
man when he's down, 
But he don't think of that till he's old. 
CHOICUS. 
Yet it's never too late to improve the mind, 
So, young people, heed what I 
say; 
By commencing in time to save every dime, 
You prepare for a 
future day. 
Men will say what fools they were, 
And the chances they lost in their time, 
Cards, billiards and dice, of course all fair, 
And at night with the boys some wine; 
They'll tell you they're sorry, they went it so fast, 
With fortune they made rather bold, 
They repent of the past, for they get broke at last, 
But they don't think of that till they're old. 
Yet it's never, etc. 
I 
have heard men say with much regret 
They never selected a 
wife, 
And now would prefer being in jail or debt 
To living a 
bachelor's life ; 
They feel the want of daughter or son, 
For the world is treating them cold; 
They have paid for their fun, now their race is near run, 
But they don't think of that till they're old. 
Yet it's never, etc. 
The ladies too, I 
am sorry to say, 
When young think of nothing but dress, 
A 
good honest man they will cast away, 
For wealth is their aim they confess; 
A 
girl won't look on a 
man who is poor, 
That's why sometimes they get sold, 
When they're so hard to please they get left very sure, 
But they don't think of that till they're old. 
Yet it's never, etc.

As soon as e'er the news was told, 
In every neighbor comes; 
Some said, " What a

Others, " Bless its gums !" 
My feelings were so glorious, 
Describe them no one can; 
And the ladies seem to look on me 
As a

Mister Snooks, you ought to feel thankful, Sir!

So, when we meet, I'll have some fun, 
And crack a

Written by JAMES COOES. 
MY 
girl is a 
most unlucky duck, but dresses in the fashion, 
She's always getting in a muss, but never gets in a 
pair 
sion, 
Her hand is like a 
bear's paw, I 
never shah forget her, 
She says her boots are number three, bat tens would fit 
her better. 
A 
circus came some time ago, and to see it she was bent; 
And when the show was over to supper of course we went, 
She eat up everything they had, my heart got in a 
flutter, 
A 
codfish ball stuck in her throat, her head went into the 
butter. 
The doctor brought a 
stomach pump, and said that she 
must die, 
She seized a 
roll of sausage and pasted him in the eye ; 
The Coroner's jury sat on her and settled the critical 
question, 
That she wore too large a 
waterfall and died of sponta-
neous combustion. 
She got up next day with a 
toothache from the bunions 
on her toes, 
Her under jaw was spavined, the epizootic got up her nose, 
She went into consumption, and I 
hear her last disaster, 
She broke her neck by falling through a 
hole in a 
porous 
plaster.

THAT WOULD BE A GREAT CHANGE. 
Written by JAMES COOKE. 
Or, late I 
have been in a 
terrible fright, 
. 
I 
find myself dwindling away, 
Toothpicks I 
don't use, I 
can't sleep at night, 
I 
eat nothing three times a 
day ; 
I 
lost all I 
had in a 
New York bank, 
Such thing the law should arrange, 
If those bankers were sent five years to jail, 
I 
think it would be a 
great change. 
I 
have courted a 
girl three years or more, 
Her equal I 
never have met, 
She said she was never in love before, 
And calls me her dear little pet; 
A young man took her out for a 
walk last night, 
And I 
feel like a 
dog with the mange, 
If she'd marry that snoozer and turn me up, 
Don't you think that would be a 
great change'? 
Our country has been in a 
very bad fix, 
Things have been going rather queer. 
Some office- holders have done bad tricks, 
And should be made to pay very dear; 
They squandered 
ur money, impoverished the poor, 
The country they'll soon disarrange ; 
If politicians would leave off their stealing, 
Don't you think it would be a 
great change 7 
A century of freedom our land has seen, 
And may she enjoy thousands more, 
Rebellion, fraud, and corruption 
May Uncle Sam keep from his door ; 
If our forefathers could only see us to- day, 
They would think we were all very strange ; 
If the next President won't take any presents, 
Don't you think that would be a 
great change 7 
And so midst the dust of history's tale 
We delve for the things now unknown, 
Forgetting that God his laws will prevail, 
And stamp us as things of his own ; 
Then hail to the Giver of all that is good, 
Our life here is simply a 
span ; 
No matter bow changeful our mood, 
The Ruhr still favors the mau. 
CALIFORNIA'S GOLDEN SHIELD. 
lnt:—" Castles in the A.r." 
Ilucll IZOBISON. 
I'm going to sing of warriors, and noble statesmen too— 
Of California's heroes, who were both brave and true, 
For love of land and open hearts they're noted through the 
world, 
And ever ready for the fray, when our nations flag's un-
furl'd ; 
Oh may our country always last, and our soldiers mways 
be, 
Ever ready to protect the banner of the free; 
And the noble souls that died for us, on many a 
well-fought 
field, 
Oh write. their name in letters bright, on 
CaVornia's Golden Shield. 
There is a 
name that's known to all, to Californiar's most 
dear, • 
It is the lamented Baker, for him we shed a 
tear, 
A statesman and a 
warrior true, one of the good old School, 
That built the nation for us, and gave us the golden rule. 
When the cry it came for volunteers, to keep our flag on 
high, 
The noble Baker rallied, but, on Ball's Bluff he did die. 
He died beneath the starry flag, on that ill-fated field. 
Oh! place his name in letters bright. on 
California's Golden Shield. 
There was the noble Broderick, too. a 
statesman very rare ; 
When in the halls of Congress he made them all to stare. 
Among the men that make our laws he nobly did stand, 
And advocated all the rights of our little golden land. 
But he W:IS taken from us, cut down while in his bloom. 
Oh ! let us join together and plant laurels round his tomb, 
And may his thine be ne'er forgot for he was true as steel. 
His name will shine through endless time, on 
California's  Golden 
rim MOON IS OUT TO-NIGHT, LOVE. 
Sung by D ELI:HA:STY and ELENGLER. 
THE moon is out to- night, love, floating through the sky, 
The little stars are laughing as she passes by, 
All the little songsters sing their pretty tune, 
happy as they can be singing to the moon. 
Clouds of silver lining waiting in the sky, 
For the moon to pass them ; Jessie, so am I. 
For I've come to meet you with a 
happy smile, 
To tell you how I 
love you, sitting on the stile. 
ClIORIIS. 
The moon is out to-night, love, meet me with a 
smile, 
I've something sweet to tell you, sitting on the stile ; 
Kiss rue when you meet me, Jessie of the Glen, 
And when I 
go to leave you I'll give it back again. 
The moon is out to-night, love, all the roses blush, 
When the ,,entle night winds tell the hh-dm to hush, 
For I 
want to listen for a 
merry voice, 
Whose every note is nrw;ic, and makes my heart rejoice; 
Jessie, I 
am watching to see it' I 
can see 
Some one like a 
fair); coming towards me ; 
Ah the little angel coming once again, 
I've a 
kiss of true love for Jessie of the Olen.

ONLY A CLOWN. 
By GEORGE EIORy. 
YES, thanks, sir, I'll have a 
small measure of beer, though I 
don't 
often treat myself so ; 
I'm 
Only a 
Clown" with no kindred or friends no life but 
that in the show ; 
My heaven—the canvas that covers our ring, and shields us 
from rains and from heats, 
My horizon— all that I 
ever have known, ends with the last row 
of seats. 
I 
was once not alone as you see me to-day, I'd a 
mate in my 
" 
Act on the Bar." 
My wife, she's an angel in heaven I 
know—on earth she was 
always a 
star. 
How did the (lie 7 No every day death; I'll tell you—but first 
let me pause— 
She died of a 
shock she got in the ring— and I 
myself was the 
cause. 
'Twas a 
benefit night, about five years ago; the tent stood in 
this very place, 
Every seat had been sold the morning before, the people had 
come from a 
race ; 
We had a 
dangerous " Act on the Bar," but we all got a 
small 
extra fee, 
Our turn was the next, we stood at the gate ; Cordello, Polly 
and me. 
I 
feared this Cordello, a 
man in our troupe, with his piercing 
and wicked black eyes, 
And he bated me with all of his heart, as I'd stolen away his 
great prize ; 
For he'd often asked Polly to come be his wife, but no answer 
from her could he get, 
And I've known him to swear by all that was good, that he 
" 
would be square with me yet." 
The act it was this—a 
bar hung on high some •fifty-five feet 
from the ground, . 
Cordello would hang, and Polly and I 
were to spring in his 
hands with a 
bound ; 
17 
ONLY A CLOWN.—Concluded. 
A 
dangerous trick, as you'll see at a 
glance, and one that de-
pends all in all, 
On the man that's above, for were he inclined, he could let 
either one of us fall. 
We sprang into the ring amid the applause, seemingly pleased 
for the while, 
But my heart It beat fast, and I 
slivk like a 
leaf, for I 
read 
that dark man's wicked smile ; 
Then we each took our place for this leap into death ! Cordello 
was quickly on high, 
But his lips seemed to say as he went up the rope, " our time's 
come; it's now you or I." 
Ile had fixed himself firm and swung by his knees, the music 
was braying out loud, 
My wife posed herself to spring to his arms, or else dash head-
long in the crowd. 
The signal was given—one bound did she make—thank God 
her arms tight round his neck, 
Now ' twas for me to trust my life there, or else fall below a 
poor wreck. 
He stretched out his bands, but it seemed just the same as the 
devil, who always cries " come 
His eyes they stared wild, I 
then saw the truth, the man was 
half crazy with rum, 
My eyesight was dim, all seemed in a 
blur, in a 
second away I 
would be, 
When my wife swung around, and hung by the bar and cried 
loudly, " Ben, jump to me." 
It was there that I 
jumped, and was safe in her arms before 
half a 
second could pass; 
Cordello was swung from the bar by the shock to the ring far 
below, a 
mere mass. 
But Polly grew worse from that very eight, she so gallantly 
saved my poor life— 
And that's why you see me sir, " Duly a 
Clown," no money, no 
friends and no wife.

Reverses in business brought me to a 
stand: 
I 
found very soon I 
should smash: 
My friends advised me to fly from the land, 
And seize upon all my loose cash: 
But my reputation was dearer to me 
Than all the bright gold in my till, . 
So I 
paid what I 
owed and proudly I 
said, 
If I'm poor, I'm a 
gentleman still. — Cho.

One evening last week, the other end of the town, 
Whilst wandering sadly nlong. 
I 
picked up a 
purse that a 
lady had dropped, 
The temptation to keep it- was stron ,r. 
My pockets were empty, but firmly I 
said. 
She shall have her own come what will; 
She looked at my dress as I 
gave it and said, 
‘• If you're poor. you're a 
gentleman still."— Cho.

Last evening I 
rescued a 
poor homeless girl 
Whom a 
swell was insultin•; I 
found 
My strength for the moment was somethiM4* immense; 
As I 
hurled the •-reat brute to the ground. 
He cried out, " you beggar. don't meddle with me 
Or very soon you'll get a 
pill." 
But I 
said. " kiv a

2U 
DON'T GET IT ON THE BRAIN. 
Written and Sung by ToNT FAE'ron. 
Air:—" You May Call Me a 
Quiz." 
I'll take this occasion to give you advice, 
It's meant in good part, so receive it quite nice. 
Don't ever be urged to take out a 
kink, 
When you know you don't want it, by taking a 
drink. 
1'll tell you the reason, and this is the why, 
And the truth, if you're smart, you cannot deny, 
There's no luck in a 
drink, I 
tell you again, 
No luck with anything square on the brain. 
5.dolcen.—Yes, what's the use of punishing one's bowels to 
accommodate a 
friend, and keep a 
shingle on sonic bum-
mer's house ? 
Whisky on the brain is a 
bad complaint, and 
$o is tnis fashion of 
don't spend all your money in one 
house," and rushing around from gin- mill to gin-mill for 
the sake of a 
familiar nod from a 
bar-keeper, for the pur-
pose of making folks think you're somebody. This fancy, 
of a 
man's trying to prove he ain't a 
sardine, always proves 
the lad only lacks the pickle to make one. 
These are the 
chaps who chuck their money over the bar as fast as they 
get it, and generally wind up as free-lunch fiends. 
No, no, 
boys! keep your heads clear, and, above all things, never 
get rum on the brain. 
There's more I 
will tell you, and I 
want you to hear, 
And the trorm. laddie bucks. 3 
mill see will appear, 
Don't, spend all you're tune at, poker and bluff, 
Or keno, or faro, or prize- candy stuff. 
Your friends and yourself will serve you the best turn, 
By keeping the money whatever you earn ; 
Don't spend it, in hair-grease. or la-da-de-da's, 
Or takinv; out lady-loves with their inam -mas. 
Spoken.—Ye, these are some of the things which young 
men should 
avoid ; a 
little gaine occasionally, however 
harmless, is a 
bad thing to get on the brain. 
In most of 
these games the more you lay down the less you take up ; 
[1] 
21 
DON'T GET IT ON THE BRAIN.--LCoNcLunin ' 
and as to making anything out of a 
prize-candy package, 
why, you might as well lay a 
ten- cent stamp on the side-
walk, and wait for some one to come along and cover it, 
with as good a 
show as you have in getting anything out 
of a 
prize-candy package. 
No, no, save your money ; buy 
a 
house, put a 
Bowery girl in it, and set her to work mak-
ing a 
uniform for the expected little la-de-da. 
There's another thing, ! addles, on free-love don't bet, 
Against Woman's Rights just make a 
dead set, 
And don't get politics or office on the brain, 
But stick to square labor, and honor you'll gain. 
Be honest, be brave, act square with a 
friend, 
Be true to your country, and money don't lend, 
Your words keep together, stay shady and sane, 
And nothing whatever gets on to the brain. 
Spoken.—Yes, above all things. put your foot down or. 
these free- love doctrines; give the coining generation the 
same chance to know their daddies that you have had ; 
give a 
woman the right to do anything but make a 
darned 
fool of themselves. 
Don't it sound nice for an old maid of 
sixty to go upon the public platform and cry out against 
these horrid, horrid men; and ain't they high old subjects 
that lecture on the manner of bringing up babies without 
nursing. 
And, above all 
things, don't spena your life 
loafing around, waiting for a 
change of administration, or 
something to turn up. 
Get knowledge, but nothing else 
on the brain, and you'll be hunkie, and that's where the 
duck swims. 
You may call me a 
quiz, you may call me a 
qui, 
But these are the things that are queer to the eye, 
And 111 tell you in earliest, and tell you again, 
Never get anything square on the brain, 
But keep a 
stray oar, whatever you do, 
With freedom to paddle you own canoe, 
As there's nothing so fatal, I 
tell you again, 
As getting any one thing square on the brain.

On one boxing-night I 
to the play took Mary Jane, 
'Twas up 'mong the " gods " at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane ; 
Gin with us we took, hot trotters I'd got in my hat, 
In the first front centre seat like royalty both of us sat. 
She disliked the pautomine, but was spooney on the clown, 
Said she, " Bill, that chap is a 
pal of mine," but to her I 
was down. 
ClIORUS.—Sad, sad, &c. 
Shame, shame on the clown, for he was a 
young married man, 
;Shame, shame upon her, for after him often she ran, 
She wanted to be a 
dancer, if he'd bring her out, 
And he promised that he would, poor girl I 
she's her clothes had 
to " spout." 
What she'd earned as a 
servant-maid she to pay the clown soon 
took, 
And the miseries she has caused this heart would fill a 
ha'p'nny 
book. 
CHORUS.— Sad, sad, &c. 
The last that I 
heard of her and her Joey the clown, 
They played in the streets, and trudged it from town into town. 
Folks never will thrive if they don't to others act right ; 
If he'd not robbed me of my love she might have performed here 
to-night. 
If you for amusements wish, take advice from me in time, 
You should take your girl to a 
music hail, not to a 
pautomine.

LT IS NOT THE MILES WE TRAVEL, BUT 
THE PACE THAT KILLS. 
As we jog along the Road of Life we pass a 
load 
Of discontented mortals who have gone too fast; 
Forfeiting their health, 
In the modern race for wealth, 
Until compb-tely beaten they break down at last ; 
But others slow and sure, 
The journey can enduie, 
Altho' the road is rugged with its dales and hills, 
They ou ,rlit to bear in mind, 
In life they'll always find, 
It's not the miles they travel but the pace that kills. 
CHORUS. 
Remember what I 
say, if yt.0 wish to pay your way, 
And not be troubled day and night with duns and bills, 
Don't travel on too fast, 
Or you may break down at last, 
for it'.s 
not the miles we travel but the pace that kills. 
I'll tell you in my song how it is I 
get along, 
So easily and merrily on life's highway; 
. 
For riches 1 
ne'er fret, 
And I 
don't run into debt, 
So I 
never find it difficult my bills to pay, 
I 
never rail at fate, 
I 
envy not the great, 
Employment keeps me healthy, and good temper keeps 
me gay, 
I 
know that labor's sweet, 
So I 
earn before I 
eat, 
And that's the way to travel, boys. on life's highwar. 
Remember what, &c. 
If fortune won't be kind at first, why never mind, 
Keep boldly trudging on, but not too fast, 
Take both good and bad 
As it comes, and don't be sad. 
If you only persevere you'll reach the goal at last, 
And if your fare is coarse, 
Think it might have been much worse. 
So travel on contented and don't despise 
The man that's slow and steady, 
Always watching— always ready, 
is the man to win the race for wealth, and gain the 
prize. 
Remember what, &c.

JUDGE NOT A MAN BY HIS CLOTHING. 
By Arrow &TRAUB. 
The Music of this Song is publiahed by E. H. 
HARDING, 288 Bowery. 
Price 10 Cents. 
Judge not a 
man by the cost of his clothing, 
Unheeding the life path that he may pursue; 
Or oft you'll admire a 
heart that needs loathing, 
And fail to give honor where honor is due. 
The paim may be hard, and the fingers stiff-jointed, 
The coat may be tattered, the cheek worn with tears; 
13qt greater than kings are labors anointed, 
[Repeat. 
You can't judge a 
man by the coat that Le wears. 
Give me the man as a 
friend and a 
neighbor, 
Who toils at the loom, with the spade or the plough ; 
Who wins his diploma of manhood by labor, 
And purchases wealth by the sweat of his brow. 
Why should the broadcloth alone be respected, 
And the men be despised who in fustian appears ; 
While the angels in heaven have their limbs nap otected [
Repeat. 
You can't judge a 
man by the coat that he wears. 
Judge of a 
man by the work he is doing, 
Speak of a 
man as his actions demand ; 
Watch well the path that each is pursuing, 
And let the most worthy be chief of the land 
And that man sha11 be found ' mid the close ra-ks of labor, 
Be known by the work that his industry rear 
And the chiefdom when won shall be dear to his neighbor [Repeat 
And we'll honor the man whatever he wears.

often long 
To be with them once again, 
In that joyous, happy throng; 
Say that from my heart I

A

Full of love and tenderness; 
Give my love to all at home.

All my thoughts are of them still ; 
Give my love to all at home.

Tell them that I 
always pray 
For their welfare as I

O'er my lone and sad pathway;

Sweet thoughts arise of home, 
With the lov'd ones gather'd there; 
Give my love to all at home.

Old Brown's gilt 
Old Brown, now, he sells very nearly 
Everything you'd please : 
Treacle, soap, and bundles of wood, 
Lollypops and cheese. 
His daughter minds the shop, 
It's a 
treat to see her serve; 
I'd like to run away with her, 
But I 
haven't got the nerve.—Caoaus. 
Poor old Brown he's very often 
Troubled with the gout, 
He " grumbles" in the little parlor, 
When he can't get out. 
Then I 
go and make a 
purchase, 
Oh, and when she hands the change, 
That gal makes me feel gal-vanized, 
I 
feels so very strange.—Cnonus. 
Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly, 
When I 
says a 
tender word, 
But old Brown says that she shall wed 
A marquis or a 
lord; 
but I 
don't think as ever 
One of them swells I 
shall be— 
But, by jingo I 
next election 
shall put up for M.P.

I COULDN'T HELP LAUGHING, IT 
TICKLED ME SO. 
From morning till night I'm indulging in mirth, 
I've always been so from the day of my birth; 
I 
grin like a Maltese cat all thro' each day, 
And never feel right unless laughing away. 
My infantile actions were certainly wild— 
All folks said I 
was a 
most wonderful chill; 
And when first short-coated, I'd have you to know, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
CHORUS. 
Hal ha! ha! ha! ho! ho! ho! ho! 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
And when, by degrees, I 
had reached man's estate? 
I 
then looked about in search of a 
mate, 
My eyes soon I 
set on a 
girl tall and fair, 
And begg'd that my heart and my home she would share. 
And while so persistently urging my claim, 
Ehie gave her consent, and at last the day came ; 
But, when in the morning to church we did go, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
I'm fond of a 
game, I'm a 
good one to chaff; 
At all kinds of mischief Fin certain to laugh; 
I 
oft play a 
lark on some innocent elf, 
Nor care though the laugh should be turned 'gainst myself. 
I 
once, walkiag out, saw a 
man in a 
fit, 
To make him come round I 
his ear quickly bit; 
And when he jumped up, knock d 
me down with one hlow. 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, etc. 
My landlord once called for his two quarters' rent, 
But I 
couldn't pay it because it was spent; 
So off to a 
broker he went very quick, 
And vowed he would seize upon every stick. 
Before he could get back, I 
gave him leg bail, 
For I 
shot the moon, but got caught, put in jail , 
And tho' plae'd in " limbo" for what I 
did owe, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
Three times in succession my partner had twins— 
My place to look like a 
small school- room begins; 
Throughout all the day there is nothing but glee, 
For all of them have laughing fits just like me. 
The last time, to add to our family joys, 
To me three presented, a 
girl and two boys; 
Wher I 
saw the three cherubs all of a 
row, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so.

132.1 GLAD WHEN SALLY COMES HOBIR 
Oh i 
I've been so sad for a 
very : our, time, 
I 
thought I'd lost that girl of min e, 
Who really is an angel divine, 
And I 
have her absence been mourninz 
Oh, Ves through her I've been made very 
To her ' twas a 
trouble to keep her hand rtill. 
Through which she got six months on the treadmill, 
But she's coiling out in the morning. 
cnOTIITS. 
Oh ! shan't I 
be glad when Sally comes home I 
When Sally collies home, when Sally collies home I 
Shan't I 
be glad when Sally corn s home! 
For she's conning out in the morning! 
Now Sally she is a 
young feminine fair, 
Sbe was to me beyond compare, 
I 
much admire her carroty hair, 
For She scorns the use of a 
chignon. 
rler father sold baked tarts in a 
tin can, 
Her brother he was a 
fat six foot policeman, 
}ler mother worked hard at the tub, pail and pan, 
And gained every one's good opinion. 
OA 
I 
shan't I 
be glad, &c. 
Now Sally she was her mamma's fondest pet, 
But unluckily, one day she not. 
A friend of hers, called " light-fin<rered Bet," 
A 
girl much addicted to cheating. 
They walked in a 
huge draper's shop one fine day 
To buy some smart ribbons and flowers so gay, 
When Sally was seen walking quickly away 
With twenty•four yards of white sheeting. 
Oh ! shan't I 
be zlac... Ate 
The ahopman on her all the time had his eye, 
And called a 
bobby then standing by. 
Though Sarah she for mercy did cry, 
He soon walked her off to the station. 
They took her before the Judge on that day, 
A 
most shocking bad case it was, he did say, 
So for six long months he sent Sally away, 
To be boarded and lodged by the nation. 
Oh I 
shan't I 
be glad, An. 
But courage and strength I'll endeavor to show, 
And set aside all signs of woe, 
From gaol to church we quickly will go, 
When they let her go out in the morning. 
And when charming Sally becomes my dear vf:e, 
We'll soon put an end to all trouble and strife, 
And, happily leading a 
good honest lire, 
'wiz act an example and weruinc.

As years rolled on I 
grew to be 
A 
mischief- making boy, 
Destruction seemed my only sport. 
It was my only joy ; 
And well do I 
remember, 
When oft times well chastised, 
lIow father sat beside me then, 
And thus has me advised :—Cno 
When I 
arrived at manhood, 
I 
embarked in public life ' 
And found it was a 
rugged road, 
Bestrewn with care and strife; 
I 
speculated foolishly, 
lesses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny little voice 
Kept whispering in my ear :—Cno. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, 
And found, to my surprise, 
Mv funds instead of sinking 
Very quickly then did rise. 
I 
grasped each chance, and always struck 
The iron while 'twas hot, 
I 
seized my opportunities 
And never once forgot :—Csio. 
I'm married now and happy, 
I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony, 
Devoid of care and strife; 
Fortune smiles upon us, 
We have little children three, 
The lesson that I 
teach them, 
As they prattle round my knee :—Cao.

Oh, once I 
was happy and fat, 
But now I 
am wretched and lean; 
The cause of which is a 
nice young girl, 
As pretty as ever was seen; 
She said she loved me true, 
And truly I 
loved her too; 
But, alas! that's past—for I 
found that law 
s Turned out a 
regular do.. 
She was such a 
nice young girl, 
And just seventeen years old, 
But she's thrown me off for a 
fellow 
With plenty of California gold. 
She'd had a 
sweet-heart, it was said, 
But long she'd thought him dead ; 
Thought I 
to myself, " Oh, won't itbe ni'oea 
If she'll take me in his stead." 
So I 
took her to this and to that. 
I 
took her to every show, 
Till the fair feminine said she'd be mine, 
In the course of a 
week or two. 
She was such, Are-
The time was fast drawing near, 
When a 
strange tale I 
did hear: 
Her first young man had turned up from abroad ; 
Oh! I 
felt most uncommonly queer 
I 
first felt hot and then cold, 
When the truth to me was told 
That this fellow'd come home in a 
couple of ships 
Full of California gold! 
She was such, dm. 
Yes, in Cali-for-ni-a, 
A 
considerable distance away, 
This party found gold in lumps and clump 
(You've heard of the stuff, I 
dare say) 
It turned out a 
wonderful sort, 
And a 
nice little fortune it brought; 
So my love deserted me for this fellow, 
And thus of my heart made sport. 
She was such, drc. 
I 
wish he'd been ate by a

THE TALK OF THE TOWN. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY. 
The Music of this song is published by E. U. 11....unrso, 229 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
WANDER thro' life like a 
gentleman's son, 
For fortune has favored me well, 
I'm blest with good temper and love to make fun, 
No matter with whom I 
may dwell; 
I've made many friends in my rambles about, 
And gained a 
good share of renown, 
'Till now I'm so famous within and without, 
It seems I'm the talk of the town. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am the talk of the town, they say, 
Friends grow around me from day to day, 
Because I 
possess such a 
charming way, 
I'm really the talk of the town. 
Wherever I 
go it is always the same, 
I'm known just as soon as I'm seen, 
They point with their fingers and mention my name, 
While taking survey of my mien ; 
I 
smile recognition, and say nothing more, 
Tho' sometimes they force me to frown, 
But I 
find it's no use to give praise or abuse, 
When I 
am the talk of the town. 
I 
am the talk, etc. 
I'm known to the girls and I'm known to the boys, 
And legions of all human kind 
O'er- shadow my footsteps in sorrows or joys, 
And give me a 
piece of their mind; 
Some love me, seine hate me, some say I'm a 
fraud, 
And many would fain crush me down. 
But such is the fate of the good and the great, 
It's because I'm the talk of the town. 
I 
am the talk, etc. 
FASHIONABLE FRED. 
Of me you may have read, I'm Fashionable Fred, 
And no matter where I 
chance to show my face, 
Pm looked on as the cheese, and all the girls I 
pleas's, 
I'm a 
model swell of elegance and grace. 
Wire in and go a-bead, then eor Fashionable Fred I 
Pit-pals the way, and shd.
n., about the word; 
Give me sufficient cash, tb.-,71 see me cut a 
dash, 
For, whatever's slow 
my idea's absurd. 
CIYGRITS. 
Yes, I'm just about the -wt. for Broadway, 
To keep the proper pace. I 
know the plan, 
Wire in and go a-head, then, for Fashionable Fred 
I'm Fashionable Fred., the ladies' man. 
My life, from first to last, has beeit jolly, gay and fast, 
In fact, to find a 
faster, you'd be teased. 
In everything I'm quick, the Yankees call it " slick," 
I'm something like a 
flash of lightning greased. 
Yet, in any running ground, I'm game, you may be bound, 
To give a 
flash of lightning ten yards start, 
I'd run for twenty pounds, and, ere we'd been twice round, 
I'd pass it like a 
bullet or a 
dart. 
For I'm just about, &a. 
This is the age for dash, and all must come out flash, 
If in this world they try to make their way. 
If you wear a 
seedy dress, you'll find to your diltress, 
All your friends will quickly turn their heads away. 
Though I'm not worth a 
groat, I 
wear a 
decent coat, 
And rattle on, and keep on going a-head; 
And all the world you see, will fraternize IN ith me, 
And soon pall in with Fashionable Fred. 
For, I'm just about, &a 
Though in the Park I 
walk, and with the ladies talk, 
My tailors' bills I 
always like to run; 
I 
canter in the Avenue, and when to balls I 
go: 
I gallop with the charming girls, like fun. 
With the times I 
keep a 
pace, and with them run a 
rot" 
Still of them I 
am always found a-head; 
Fm ready for a 
lark, no matter light or dark, 
Up to any game is Fashionable Fred. 
For, I'm lust about, &e.

ME 
DANCED LE 
A. FAIRY. 
Ill relate to you, public, the source of my woes: 
They're worse than hard blows, for, nobody knows, 
When with love your young heart. lilt- a 
cauliflower gruwe, 
And the girl don't care two-pence for you. 
rhe case it is mine, I'm sorry to gay, 
Throw-
2...h a 
girl, when I 
think, my heart heaves, 
Whom I 
taught to dance in an exquisite way, 
And sing twice as well as Sims Ileaves. 
CHORUS. 
She danced like a 
fairy, and sang like a 
bird, 
She did, on my word; but, rather absurd, 
She doated on Charley, a 
man that you've heard, 
And so she skedaddled from me. 
Then. her father sold goods on a 
second band plan, 
when he began, no meat in tee pan, 
But, from little to big, he b-came a 
great man, 
And he, now, his a 
h 
Ind-me-down shop. 
Coats, treueere and waistcoats, for him she would turn, 
And convert the old shirts into new, 
When businese was done, then her step she would leern, 
And dance in a 
suit of light blue. [She danced, &a 
The first time that I 
met her, 'twas at her Pa's shop; 
I 
outside did stop, then inside did pop, 
Half-aesovereign bright in her little palm drop, 
Said: 11.ive you got a 
suit to fit me? 
She Showed an assortment, hats, coats, boots as well, 
And., at last, I 
chose these like a 
man; 
She said I 
looked han tsome, in love with ele fell, 
From that time our courtship began. [She aan,ed, &e 
On each Saturday-night, I 
my clothes would redeem, 
It's just like a 
dream, so strange does it seem, 
Just to think we, on Sundays, looked like King and, Queen, 
When from" Uncle's" I'd. borrowed my clothes. 
Ile'd end me my chesterfield, just for the day., 
And, on Mondays, I' 
take him them back, 
The money spent on her, but to mr dismay, 
One morning she gave me the sack. [She danced, ltee 
nut sweet Charley, got clothes from the same shop as me, 
And, soon. I

THINK OF YOUR HEAD IN THE MORNING, 
Ain—" Over the Water to Charlie." 
Tom Jennings who never goiald drinking avold, 
Thouem ‘ ows he was always a 
making, 
For ; liter each boat he was sorely annoyed, 
Widi nervousw.ss aud head aching. 
Going out to a 
aurty one evt thug set week, 
ilia Wile slid to into as a Warning: 
Now, it e:ceriti, dear foul, and mold what you drink, 
And think of yoar head in the morning. 
CHOIMS. 
Think, think, think, think, 
Think of your head in the morning. 
He promised sincerely to bear it in mind, 
And at dicier at first he was cautious, 
And thowei very good he the sherry did find, 
lie s 
ppeil it as I- it were nauseous, 
But wine will the best resolution destroy, 
And ti length he forgot his wife's waruin7. 
Thougn he said At each 
ASS, " Tom, he cautious, my boy; 
Aud think of your ieadiu the mOrning " 
Think, think, &e. 
Whilst during the night he was asked for a 
toast, 
lie gave 1 
ke a 
nrin of discerniog. 
" 
Here's the friend we can trust, with the girt we love /nod. 
Who will think of our heads in the morning," 
" 
Bravo I" said they, 
that'e a 
capital say," 
And thy drank it with glasses upturning— 
" 
Here's denniiis' sentiment, hip, hi a, hurrah,l' 
Think of tlieir heads in the morning. 
Think, think, &c. 
Whilst steering home, and with drink i.early 
lie ran azanost a 
pump near a 
turning, 
" 
Really," says he, - that's very unkind-
Think of my head in the morning." 
Then, atagmring on, as be fell in his way. 
Says he, " Sir, you might give me warning," 
As flat ou his tack in the gutter he lay, 
Says he, " Spruce, I 
will look in in the morning 
Spruce, & c. 
With his head swimming' round. as he lay ou the ground. 
Think of 
is head in tae morning, 
The police coining round, quickly him found, 
Repentiwz, and groaning and yawwng. 
At lengt 
he reached home, Wil h 
his hat without brim, 
\Caen his spouse she repeated her warning.

OUR FIFER-BOY. 
A IR:—" JANIES' BIRD, or, Dying Californian." 
While the battle hot was raging, 
And the shot and shell did fly, 
And smoke around our rigging curling, 
Then I 
heard a 
piercing cry. 
Close beside me lay our fifer ; 
From his bosom spouted blood ; 
There he lav pierced by a 
bullet ; 
Dying in a 
crimson flood. 
Shipmates, said he, tell my father, 
Tell him I 
died like a 
man, 
Died in battle for my Countr ,, , 
While blood, around, in torrents ran. 
Tell my mother, g0ntly tell her, 
Lest the news should break her heart; 
Tell her that her son will meet her 
Where we never more shall part. 
Oh ! 
how sad I 
am to leave. her ! 
How she'll mourn about, my loss 
Her Charlie never more will greet her, 
Never more the ocean cross ! 
Tell my sister, (Heaven bless heel) 
That her brother is no more, 
Hand in hand, no more we'll ramble 
On Old Hudson's pleasant shore 
Tell my brother, in the army 
On Potomac's sunny shore, 
That our navy is victorious, 
And we'll be so evermore ! 
Here he paused— and ceased from talking, 
Gently yielded up his breath ; 
heavenly smile lit up his features, 
And his eyes were closed in death 
You tell me that you love me, I 
fain would believe, 
And will make me your bride and never deceive: 
You offer to me your heart and your hand, 
And make me the mistress of houses and land. 
I 
am but a 
poor girl, the truth I 
will tell, 
My m other's a 
widow, in yon cottage doth dwell, 
She who nursed me in sickness, with little in store, 
Now I'll never desert her because she is poor. 
You have promised me servants and carriages so gay, 
And perhaps to deceive me, and lead me astray, 
For some men they will flatter to destroy a 
girl's name, 
And soc;ii she's reduced to e 
sad life of shame ; 
And then she's insulted by each passer-by. 
Her life is a 
burden, she could lay down and die, 
While here ern I 
contented, by oar own cottage door. 
There's none like a 
mother, if ever so poor. 
My dear father's words still ring in my ears, 
When dying he bid me my Maker to fear, 
And be kind to my mother, from her never part, 
if I 
were to leave her, it wculd break her heart. 
Still if we were to marry I 
should lead a 
sad life. 
When your friends, that are rich, knew you'd got a 
poor wife, 
Your parents might slight me, it has been so before, 
I'll not leave my mother, altho' she is poor. 
But if I 
wore your equal, with wealth to command 
I'd willingly give you my heart and my hand, 
And 500th every sorrow, dispel every care, 
Fur there's truth in your face-1 
believe you're sincere 
if your parents would bless us, and give their consent. 
We would all live together in peace and content, 
Then my poor aged mother should sorrow no more, 
For their's none like a 
mother, be she rich or poor.

THE DYING CALIFORNIAN. 
Hearken to me, brother, hearken I 
I've something I 
would say, 
Ere the veil my vision darkens, and I 
go from earth away. 
I 
am dying, brother, dying; soon you'll miss me from your berth, 
And my form will soon be lying 'neath the ocean's briny surf. 
Lay up nearer, brother, nearer, for my limbs are getting cold, 
And thy presence seemeth dearer when thine arms around me fold. 
I 
am going, brother, going, yet toy hope in God is strong; 
/ 
am willing, brother, knowing that he doeth nothing wrong. 
Tell my father, when you greet him, that in death I 
prayed for 
him ; 
Prayed that I 
might, one day, meet him in a 
world that's free from 
Tell my mother, God will help her now that she is growing old; 
Say her child did yearn to kiss her when his lips grew pale and 
cold. 
Listen, brother ; catch each whisper; 'tis my wife I'd speak of now; 
Tell, oh! tell her how I 
missed her, when the fever burned my 
brow. 
Tell her—brother, closely listen; don't forget a 
single word ; 
That, in death my eyes did glisten with the tears her memory 
stirred. 
Tell her, she must kiss my children, like the kiss I 
last impressed; 
hold them as when last 1 
held them, folded closely to my breast; 
Give them early to their Maker, putting all their trust in God, 
And he never will forsake her, for lie says so in His Word. 
Oh ! my children—Heaven bless them! they were all my life to 
me! 
Would I 
could once more caress them, ere I 
sink into the sea. 
"Iwas for them I 
crossed the ocean, what my hopes were, I'll not 
tell; 
For they've gained an orphan's portion, yet He doeth all things 
well. 
Tell my sisters I 
remember every kindly parting word; 
And my heart has been kept tender by the thoughts their memory 
stirred. 
Tell them I 
never reached the haven where I 
sought the precious 
dust; 
But I've gained a 
port called heaven, where the gold will never 
rust. 
Tell them to secure an entrance, for they will find their brother 
there; 
Faith in Jesus and repentance will secure for each a 
share. 
Hark! I 
hear my Jesus speaking; 'Us his voice I 
know so well. 
When I'm gone, oh! do a 
t 
be weeping; brother, here's my last 
farewell!

JERSEY SAM. 
Oh! I 
was bo-n in Jersey, 
And of that I'm going to sing; 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wiog-. 
I 
went way down to New Orleans, 
And there I 
fought the foe, 
Along with Hickory Jackson, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
C11011IS. 
For I 
am one of the olden time, 
And may be thought too gay, 
But I'm Jersey Sam, the Farmer's man, 
Hurrah! hurrah 1 
hurrah! 
I 
bear the name of Samuel, 
Though some, they call me Sam, 
And through this world I 
rove along, 
• As hapny as I 
can ; 
The world, they say, has been improved 
But I 
should like to know, 
If folks are any better now, 
Than Fifty Years ago. 
For i 
am one, dets 
When I 
was young, then boys were boys, 
And went to bed at ten; 
But now, when they are twelve years old, 
They think that they are men. 
You'll hear them call 
they 
rum and beer, 
And smoke cigars, height-ho ! 
What would our parents have thought of that 
Sum Fifty Yeats ago ? 
For I 
am one, Suk 
At midnight, too, one hears young men, 
With husky voices sing, 
That " Champagne Charlie" is their name, 
And they know it's no :such thing; 
They go to bed with a 
head-
ache, 
At least they tell us so. 
I 
never heard of such a 
thing, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one, dza 
The women of the present time, 
They cannot draw a 
line ; 
But wear our hats and jackets, 
And appear quit e 
masculine ; 
They wear false hair, for it's the style, 
And call it their own ; you know— 
But our girls would scorn to wear a 
wig, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one dr.o. 
FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
Words and Music by CLARIZZL. 
The dew lay Wittering o'er the grass, 
A mist lay over the hnook, 
At the earliest beam of the golden sue, 
The swaAow her nest forsook. 
The snowy blooms of the hawthorn tree, 
Lay thickly the ground ttdorning, 
The birds w' re singing in every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The birds were singing n 
every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And Bessie, the rui'kuutid, merrily sang, 
For meadows We! e 
fr sh and fair. , 
The breeze of the morning k 
ssed her brow, 
And p'ayed with her nut-brown hair, 
But oft she turned and looked around, 
As if the silence scorning; 
'Twas time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning, 
'Twas time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And over the meadow the mowers caw, 
And merry their voices rang, 
And one among them wended his way, 
To where the milk nelitl sang. 
And 'as he lingered by her side. 
Despite his comrade's ‘: rning, 
The old, old s 
cry was told aga n, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The old, old story was told again, 
At five o 
clock in the morning.

WILL NO MAIDEN MARRY MR 
By 
II. 
KLEBER. 
All the girl: are getting married— 
Dropping oil' on every side, 
Ah! I 
fear too long I've tarried, 
Seeking, sighing for a 
bride. 
Here I 
am, ye tender damsels, 
Young and handsome as you see, 
Will no maiden marry ? marry I 
Will no maiden marry me ? 
I 
could get a 
weeping widow, 
Almost any day, of course, 
Or a 
lady rendered single, 
By a by a 
late divorce. 
But I 
want a 
tender rose- bud, 
Innocent, and full of glee: 
Will no maiden, dm 
Oh! in pity don't. deny me, 
Let me end this weary life, 
I 
would swim the wide Atlantic, 
Could I 
thereby gain a 
wife, 
I'm in eaonest, I 
am pleading, 
Here upon my bended knae, 
Will no, &c. 
All is over ! I 
am married! 
What a 
hasty fool atn I, 
Where's the end of all creation, 
Let, oh I 
let me thither fly, 
Help, oh ! help me, cunning lawyer, 
Loose my bonds and set me free, 
I 
will be your debtor forever. 
If you will uumarry me. 
I ALWAYS SAY I'M SINGLE 
Words and Music by J. BATCHELDER. 
Kind friends. I.ve found a 
secret out 
And which I'll tell you ail about, 
The truth of it you will not doubt, 
If with the upper ten you mingle. 
You must do as 1 
do, that's the way, 
And then you're sure to win the day ; 
If they say, " Are you married, pray 2' 
I 
always say I'm single. 
CFIORLIS. 
Kind friends, let our voices mingle, 
Clink your glasses. let them jingle, 
For here and there, and everywhere, 
I 
always say I'm single. 
One night I 
went to a 
fancy ball, 
I 
was asked to dance by nearly all, 
A 
girl in love with me did fall, 
Her name was Patty Pringle 
Her brother stood cigars and wine, 
Her toothier said I 
danced divine, 
And in the waltz I 
cut a 
shine, 
I 
whispered, " Love, I'm single I" 
Kind friends, etc. 
As thro' the world we onward rove 
Let's keep always on the move, 
And if it comes you fall in love, 
Be sure that you are single. 
Take no heed of care or strife, 
Be just and honest all thro' life ; 
And don t 
forget if you've a 
wife 
To love her as when single. 
Kind friends. etc.

READY-MADE LOVE- LETTERS 
COMPRISING 
Every Style and Fashion of Note and Letter incident to Love, 
Courtship, and marriage, which should pass between 
Ladies and. Gentlemen from, First Acqaintance 
to Final Union. 
This Book teaches plainly—so plainly that the most simple can 
understand and make use of the lessons taught. 
It tells a Lady how to meet a 
Gentleman's advances. When to seem a 
little forward when to seem a 
litle shy. How a 
lady should meet, and how 
part from a 
Laver. Shows Ladies and Gentlemen how to act to each other, 
and in company, in all the parts of Bride, Bridegroom, Bridesmaid, and 
Groomsman. How to act at the Altar and at the Wedding Feast. How to 
behave during the Honeymoon, and how and whom to receive and visit. 
In brief, teaches everything that Lovers should know about Court-
ship- its attendant j:iys and troubles; of the Marriage Ceremony, its customs 
and the thousand dubiea, cares and pleasures that attend and follow. 
It is a 
perfect vade mecum. 
Study it and you can act easy, natural, and 
genteel in all the ,above positions, and pass with success through all these 
most trying and difficult scenes-equally well with any lady or gentleman 
born to wealth and brought up in fashionable society. 
This Rook also tells you-Ilow to write your first letter to a 
lady. 
How the lady should reply. 
how a 
gentleman is to tell he loves. 
What the 
lady should write in reply. How a 
gentleman should write to a 
lady, under 
all and any circumstance. 
What the lady's replies should be. 
Shows how 
widowers as well as bachelors should woo widows, whether young or middle-
aged 
In short there is not an occasion of any kind calling for a 
correspond-
ence on the subject of Love and Matrimony but what is here treated of, and 
plainly and fully explained. 
To which are :annexed, SPECIMEN LOVE LETTERS, 
written by persons in real lite, in every possible contingency that can occur;
