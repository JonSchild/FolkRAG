DON'T YOU DO IT. 
Sung by the 3IURDoCH'S, with great success. 
We'll give you now some good advice, 
All in a 
friendly way, 
Concerning things that oft deceive, 
That happen every day, 
When hard times stare you in the face, 
And pocket-books are thin, 
Don't say there's no use trying, 
If you do you'll never win. 
°litmus. 
Don't you do it! 
Don't you do it! 
For you know it never pays. 
Don't you do it! 
Don't you do it! 
Wait for better days. 
Oh! 
Don't you do it! 
Don't you do it! 
Never . give yourself away. 
Don't you do it! 
Don't you do it! 
Mind what we say. 
Don't trot because your clothes are old, 
But keep your heart all right; 
Don't swear because you cannot sport 
A 
diamond pin to-night; 
Don't make love to strange young girls, 
And say she charms your life; 
But first be very careful that 
She ain't somebody's wife. 
Don't you do it, etc. 
Don't laugh at other people's faults, 
But first look to your own, 
When friends are few, because you're down, 
Just go it all alone; 
And when good luck comes on once more, 
We hope you won't wait long. 
And while you spend your greenbacks, 
Don't forget this little song. 
Don't you do it, etc.

THAT YOUNG MAN ACROSS THE WAY, 
SONG AND CHORUS. 
Words by MISS KATIE BELLE W ICHMANN. 
Music by E. MACE 
Well, I 
wonder what's the meaning, 
Always looking over here, 
When I'm at the parlor window, 
He is sure then to appear; 
Every evening as I 
sit there, 
Just before the close of day, 
There he is, with roguish glances, 
Watching me across the way. 
CHORUS. 
So let him stare, I 
do not care, 
I 
shall not go away; 
Young men who live across the street, 
Must look•across the way. 
He has brown hair, dark and waving, 
And his eyes, I 
think, are gray,. 
But I 
know, whate'er their color, 
Often do they look this way, 
And one tender twilight evening, 
I'm quite sure that he did this— 
Just before I 
left the window, 
Unto me he threw a 
kiss. 
So let him stare, etc. 
From the other side, one evening, 
To our door he found his way, 
After that, 'twas very often 
That he came across the way; 
And while sitting by our window, 
There was much he made me say, 
And, 'mong other things, I 
promised 
That I'd live across the way. 
So let him stare, etc. '

CHORUS. 
'BOTH.—A 
little bit hazy we are both; 
But lovers are always that way; 
We'Rsoon get wed, then merry be, 
If we don't get led astray; 
We'll live in clover all the day, 
As happy as a 
big .brass band, 
And happier yet, 
If you would give us your kind and cheering hand.

Around on the corners yore they stand, 
Awaiting for some one to treat, 
They would break up any soup- house in the land.

And that is the reason their hair turns gray,

Let your hearts be happy and light; 
For nothing is gained by crying, you know, 
So keep your eyes sparkling and bright.

So when the weather's proper, I'm ready in a

To take my usual walk out on Sunday. 
A

But the exercise ot walking I 
would much advise, 
And oh, such funny sights, and oh such horrid guys 
You meet with when you're walking out on Sunday. 
CHORUS. 
Walking out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Crawling out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Driving out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
It's awful jolly walking out on Sunday. 
Sow there's Augustus Tompkins, a 
very heavy swell, 
He manages to live somewhere on Murray Hill, 
You'd take him for a 
banker or a 
broker dowli on Wall street 
When he crawls out to do his walk on Sunday, 
With his silver-headed cane, and a

He twirls his fine moustache, which suspicious looks of dye, 
In fact you seldom see, se elegant a 
guy, 
Ai Tompkins when he's crawling out on Sunday.

YOU ARE AN AWFUL TEASE, 
Music Published by E.

H ARDING, 229 Bowery, N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
SONG AND CHORUS. 
My Susan has the sweetest face, 
In all Manhattan Isle; 
The whitest hand, the smallest waist, 
The most bewitching smile; 
And when by her bright lips I 
swore 
Her love would crown my bliss, 
I 
thought I 
was in duty bound, 
The rosy book to kiss. 
Cnoitus. 
Don't now ! Don't now, modest Susan cried, 
As bashfully she turned from me, 
Her blushing cheeks to hide. 
Don't now ! don't now ! darling, if you please! 
Well, have your way, though I 
must say, 
You are an awful tease. 
T 
gazed on her retreating form. 
With rapture most intense, 
And as she waved adieu to me, 
I 
thought she looked immense; 
The naughty pull- back dress, 
That to her charming figure clings, 
Rekled her little fairy feet, 
As light as fancy's wings. 
Don't now! Don't now, etc. 
My heart was leaping with ielight, 
No thought of care or pa,,., 
I 
dreamt of Susan all the night, 
And sighed to dream again, 
• 
17 
When by the squalling cats disturbed, 
That round the roof did stroll, 
As Susan's modest chidings fell, 
Like music on my soul. 
Don't now Don't now, etc. 
So all went like a 
marriage bell, 
Upon a 
summer's day, 
Till I 
discovered she was false, 
Or had been led astray. 
I 
saw her standing with a 
swell, 
Whose arm was around my dear; 
And, as I 
passed, her silv'ry voice 
Stole softly on my ear. 
Don't now! Don't now, etc. 
'Tis sad to find your friends are false, 
Your pockets void of cash; 
To find remains of toothless combs 
And boot-heels in your hash; 
But 0, what grief was mine to hear 
My cruel rival say, 
Another kiss, you're all my own, 
Since you have named the day. 
Don't now! Don't now, etc.

Grandpa's chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate; 
Where he told his tales of boyhood, 
Kept the little ones awake. 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night, like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORDS. 
So let the room be cheerful, 
Place the old arm chair 
Where we talked to Grandpa, 
With his silvery snow white hair. 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, we all must die, 
Like the fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window, 
A careworn, hapless child; 
Then Grandpa whispered " baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin, he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, etc 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame; 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold and hungry, 
With Grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
prayer she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, ate.

IT'S SIMPLY IMMENSE, 
Composed and sung by CHARLES KONOLLMA.N, and sung 
by him at the Third Avenue Theatre, N 
Y., with great 
success. 
New by-words we now have enough— 
Aye! hundreds, anthplenty to spare, 
They are cited by the high-toned and rough, 
But the latest .! think takes the,chair ; 
You'll hear it wherever you go, 
And at it you'll not take offense, 
So I'll give it without more ado— 
The latest word out is " Immense." 
CHORUS. 
" 
You're a 
snide," and a " bloat," are played out, 
And " What do yer say ?" has no sense, 
But the latest of all you'll admit 
It suits, and " It's Simply Immense." 
We've *Airs that have troubled our land, 
Concerning the people and State, 
The perambulation of Tweed 
In eluding the law was first rate ; 
Now in Ludlow Street Jail he's been caged, 
Minus some dollars and cents, 
And the police do proudly relate 
That his capture, you know, was " Immense." 
CHORUS. 
"Pull Down Your Vest" is played out, 
And " Wipe off Your Chin " had no sense, 
But the latest you all_will admit 
t 
it, suits, and " It's Simply immense." 
In Brooklyn's great hour of sorrow 
Let us willingly stretch forth our hands, 
To help the poor widows and orphans, 
Rendered helpless through fire's fell brand ; 
The generosity of the actors we admire, 
It will be cited a 
century hence, 
Their generosity they showed by their wallets, 
And that you must say was Immense." 
CHORUS. 
So follow the actors' example, 
In the matter of dollars and cents, 
Let your sorrow be of these a 
sample, 
Then we shall say you are " Immense." 
Now to an end my song does approach, 
And I 
hope it's not been out of place, 
And that you don't think I 
encroach, 
'But appreciate my efforts with grace; 
And if I 
ask for your applause, 
I 
hope you'll not take offence, 
And call here another time, 
Then you may think Charlie " Immense." 
CHORUS. 
Pull Down the Blind's" getting dim, 
" 
Turn Down your Collar" had no sense, 
But this late one you all will admit 
It suits, and It's Simply Immense." -

THE MURPHY TWINS. 
Written by JOHN SHEEHAN, and sung by the famous SHEEHAN 
& 
JONES in their original sketch entitled " The Arrival 
of the Murphys." 
We are the Murphy twins, 
From the County of Kildare, 
We just arrived this morning, 
At the Castle Garden pier; 
We are looking out for Mulberry Street, 
Where lives our brother*Dan, 
He iS an American citizen,' 
Likewise an alderman. 
Cllouus. 
We are the Murphy twins, 
From the Gounty of Kildare, 
We have just arrived this morning, 
At Castle Garden pier; 
We crossed the stormy ocean, 
To become _American citizens, 
Where could you rind an Irish pair 
Could beat the Murphy twins. 
The morning we left Kildare, 
Our mother she did say— 
Hold up your heads me •children, 
For you are going to America; 
You may become aristocrats, 
Or Democrats, you know, 
But don't forget old Ireland, 
Wherever you way go. 
We are, etc. 
UPOC1 a 
rustic bridge we met 
One afternoon in spring; 
}Us loving words .1, can't forget. 
Within my ears they ring I 
The swans were sailing on the Lake 
And all the Park was gay; , 
My hand in his he chanced to take 
In such. a 
charming way 1 
The flowers were bright, but oh, his eves, 
They shone like stars of night! 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delight, 
I 
seemed in love's.delicions dream, 
My heart with rapture beat: 
Aiid while his eyes did on me beam, 
I 
heard his lips repeat: 
Cliortes. 
There is no harm in kissing, 
Pray tell me, is there, dear? 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near. 
Then loving ones are meeting, 
No prying eyes to mark; 
There is no harm in kissing, (e 
kiss) 
At twilight in the Park! 
We strolled along where roses grow, 
And all was bright and fair; 
He promised ever to be true, 
And begged my love to share. 
The little birds were flying home, 
They heard my lips reply; 
And stars were bright in yonder dome 
Before we say good-bye. 
But, oh, he seemed so sad to leave— 
My heart grew sad as well, 
For love within each heart did weave 
,Ls dear bewitching spell. 
We lingered, though the hour was late. 
How quickly time had sped; 
But when our lips met at the gate, 
He softly to me said: 
There is no harm, etc.

ROLLING ON THE GRAM. 
To those who live in cities, 
Where but bricks and mortar's sees, 
There's nothing so refreshing, 
As " a 
little bit of green i" 
So often on a 
summer's day,. 
An idle hour to pass, 
Off to the fields I'd get away. 
And roll about the grass. 
CHORUS. 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the butterctips and dahilos, 
That s 
the way', that'if did way; 
An idle hour tc paSS ; 
Rolling on the grass. 
. ' Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you'rei.a; child again; 
Rolling on the grasn. 
The prettiest of carpets ' tis, 
That ever could be found„ 
With daisies sprinkled here and there, 
And Maybushes around: 
A bright blue roof, above o'er which 
The silver clouds sail by, 
And skylarks- 
think it but, a 
Larlc, 
To sing up in the sky. 
While you're rolling on the grass; 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
That's the way, that's the way, 
An idle hour to: pass. 
Rolling on' the grass,. 
'Mongst the buttercupe and daisies; 
Fancying you,re a 
child. again; 
Rolling on the grass. 
One day, whilst I 
reclining was, 
And half inclined ts dream, 
27 
I 
suddenly was startled by 
A female's piercing scream; 
Towards ma rushed a 
pretty girl, 
-In fearful state of mind, 
And followed by a 
frantic cow. 
Unpleasantly behind. 
t's.-r4ELIT.-- 
Of course to spring to my feet and catch the faint-
ing tvaiden in my arms was but the work of a 
quarter of a 
se-ond; the cow on seeing my defiant attitude came to a 
full stop, 
a"-k 
stare4; I 
said, waving my hat commandingly, " Go away, 
cow—go away directly!" and so she did, and sent us both— 
CHORUS. 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
That's the way, that's the way, 
That awful cow did pass; 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you're a 
child again, 
Rolling on the grass. 
I 
often met her after that, 
And this was my excuse, 
That should " a 
frantic cow" turn up, 
I 
perhaps might .be of use; 
She's going to change 'her name for mine, 
When a 
few 'short weeks shall pass, 
And so I 
bless that blessed cow, 
And rolling on the grass.

HURRAH FOR THE MINSTREL BAND! 
Dedicated to HARRY SANDRRsoN. 
Originally sang by FRANK D MUS. 
Music published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. Y. 
Price, 10 ista 
There is not a 
man in the whole Minstrel Band, 
Who would ever go back on a 
friend; 
Tho dark be his face, yet the black can't efface 
The kind deeds which through life him attend. 
I 
hear the trumpet sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the -land— 
I 
list to its voice, and it bids me rejoice ; 
Then hurrah for the Minstrel Band! 
Then Hurrah! then Hurrah! 
Then hurrah for the Minstrel Band! 
I 
will speak first of one who we loved in the past, 
He'd a 
heart that was noble and brave— 
Nelse Seymour, who never refused his last dime, 
If he thought you from hunger .'
twould save. 
I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land— 
The tall Son of York, he died at his work, 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band! 
And the pride.!—and the pride! 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band ! 
Brave Unsworth, he stood like a 
Minstrel so true 
'Till defeated at last by grim death; 
And Budworth, alas! broke his old banjo string, 
Which he loved 'till he parted with breath. 
I 
hear their dirge now sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land. 
They lived and they died with the Boys that they lov'd, 
The dear Boys of the Minstrel Band! 
The Dear Boys ! the Dear Boys ! 
The Dear Boys of the Minstrel Band! 
But now I 
must speak of the Prince of them all— 
Who is that but our own gallant Dan! 
Let every one mourn for our Chieftan is gone— 
Dan Bryant! the Minstrel and Man I 
I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land. 
He lived and he died, both our glory and pride; 
He was King of the Minstrel Band.! 
He was King! he was King! 
He was King of the Minstrel Band'

S. 
KNIGHT. Music by FRANK CARDELI.A. 
Watch our style and dashing figure, 
We always travel with gentlemen, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten; 
We always did detest that vulgar name of nigger, 
We've been called by that name, and though it did of-
fend, 
We never did take notice or the insult e'er resent, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my gracious! can't we sling our yams (.kreak) 
Glory hallelujah to all the blessed lambs, 
(
break) 
Watch our feet and watch them close, they've educated 
been, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten. 
We always dress up to the fashion, 
At each resort we both have been, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten; 
We're up to every game, and that you bet your cash on, 
At every race of note you'll find we do attend, 
We never borrow money nor neither do we lend, 
For we're known as two of the colored upper ten, 
Known as two of the colored upper ten. 
Oh, my gracious, etc.

NEVER GO BACK ON THE FLAG. 
Written by M. J. HACKETT. 
Words revised and Music by 
CHAS. KONOLLMAN, and sung by him with immense success 
at Josh Hart's Summer Theatre, and Tivoli Theatre, 
New York. 
Music can be obtained at W. A. PoNn k 
Co's, 54 Broadway, 
New York. 
A 
privilege it is to be born in this land 
Of the noble, the proud and the free, 
Where each man will offer his heart and his hand, 
To drive out such cruel tyranny, 
Such as was practiced by English rule, 
In the days of oppression gone by; 
But like solid men to the front they did come, 
Determined to conquer or die. 
CHORUS. 
Then good people here just take my advice, 
No matter whatever you lag; 
If you should have the honor vo adopt this land. 
Pray never go back on the flag. 
If you take this advice you will surely find 
A 
blessing you'll find in the end; 
And you will be loved by the good and the kind, 
If to your duty you do well attend. 
But be not like the men who would gain themselves 
wealth, 
And to crime they will let themselves drag; 
But be honest and upright, and above all you do. 
Pray never go back on the flag. 
Then good people, etc. 
It was under that flag that Benjamin Franladin was born, 
A 
statesman both noble and true, 
Though poor at the first, yet himself he did raise, 
To be proud of the red, white and blue. 
It was under that flag that George Washington was born, 
The father of this country, 
And with many others he nobly fought, 
To make it the land of the free. 
Then good people, etc. 
AT IT,,AGAIN. 
Original Comic Song. 
Written, composed, and sung wittl 
terrific success by FRED. J. 
MACKLEY. 
Through a 
very queer saying I 
oft have to smile; 
I'll tell you a 
strange one the time to beguile. 
When I 
first went a 
courting, the dear one to woo. 
I'd call her such pet names like us fellows do, 
We'd have lots of fun, I 
would play and she sing, 
And talk of the future and what it would bring. 
Then when I 
on parting a 
kiss strived to gain, 
I'd hear her pa's voice yell—" You're at it again." 
CHORUS. 
At it again! 
At it again! 
You ought to know better. 
Your acting insane. 
At it again ? 
At it again! 
Why don't you stop it? 
You're at it again! 
One night I 
stayed late, as the old man had retired, 
And moonlight love-making she said she admired. 
Said I, " Now, my darling, just give me one kiss:" 
And in trying to reach her I 
made a 
sad miss. 
For I 
upset the table, She gave a 
loud scream, 
Which soon awoke the old man out of his dream, 
Who seized his revolver, and down stairs he came, 
Yelled " That wicked old Tom cat's broke something 
again." 
At it again, etc. 
In peace and contentment I 
pass my time away ; 
I 
married my Nellie so handsome and gay. 
We have lots of fun, in our house near the Park, 
And her father comes there With the same old remark. 
But the last time he came, now imagine his joy, 
He found he was grandpa to a 
girl and a 
boy. 
He winked at my wife, and said, " Now, it's plain, 
The babies are beauties, and they're laughing again." 
At it again, etc,

KNEW THAT I 
WAS DREAMING. 
Written and composed by FRED ALBERT. 
Music published by E. H. HAttmxo, 229 Bowery. 
Price 10 
cents. 
Dreams are the strangest things in life, 
So fanciful, yet real, 
Sometimes depicting scenes of strife, 
In others they reveal 
Such happiness, that were it not 
Some sign the spell was breakiirg, 
That we were sleeping we'd forget, 
And fancy we were waking. 
Some strange dreams I 
have had of late, 
My 
.brain with thoughts been teeming, 
And if you'll listen I 
will state 
What I've seen when I've been dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw.a 
race- coin's°, 
And a 
crowd assembled there, 
To watch each noble race- horse, 
As towards the post they tear; 
I 
dreamt there was no welching— 
But all were acting fair, 
And I 
thought there was no filching, 
Or card sharping I 
declare. 
Well soon the race did begin.. 
The colors they were streaming, 
And I 
thought each jockey tried to win— 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
postman, 
Who was hurrying on his rounds, 
Of letters he'd a 
host, man, 
And so nimbly on he bounds; 
I 
thought it just struck eight o'clock, 
The maid the steps was cleaning, 
And I 
thought he gave a 
gentle knock, 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
He was so curiously arrayed. 
The buttons bright were gleaming, 
Then some one said he was well paid, 
Then 1 
knew I 
must be dreaming, 
I 
dreamt I 
saw all area gate, 
And a 
bobby standing near, 
A servant maid with mincing' gait. 
Come forth to fetch some ''beer ; 
I 
saw him kiss her on the sly, 
So life-like it was seeming, 
But when he refused sonic rabbit pie— 
Then I 
knew 1 
must be dreaming. 
A row commenced close by there, when 
For police they loud were screaming, 
He came when he was wanted, 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
music hall. 
And a 
waiter on his way, 
To serve some gent within the stalls, 
With something on a 
tray: 
saw him hand politely 
The glass with liquor streaming, 
But he went away without the fee, 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
thought that every comic song 
Was full of wit and meaning, 
I 
felt convinced that I 
was wrong— 
And knew I 
must be dreaming. 
DON'T PUT THE POOR WORKINGMAN 
DOWN. 
Words and Music by BO BBY NEwcumn. 
Copyrighted, 1877, by F. W. HELMICK, No. 50 West Fourth 
Street. Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Price 33 cents. 
How oft when we hear of misfortime. 
Befalling a 
friend or a 
foe, 
If ;n 
joy or regrets we express it, 
That's the way of the world you all know ; 
I 
thought I 
would speak of a 
subject, 
Interesting each village and town. 
That is iron- heeled capital striving 
To put the poor workingman down. 
CHORUS. 
Let-capital shake hands with labor. 
Let the poor have the bread that they earn. 
For surely they need every penny. 
Is a 
lesson quite easy to learn ; 
Remember the poor love their children, 
So give them a 
smile, not a 
frown. 
Live, and let live, be your motto. 
Oh ! don't put the poor workingman down. 
That money is the root of all evil. 
Why all of us likely's found out. 
The richer class think that the poorer. 
Should of pleasure know nothing about : 
The honest poor always will labor, 
They don't ask a 
title or crown, 
-Why begrudge them sufficient to live on. 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital. etc. 
So now in conclusion I'll mention. 
That life being dear to us all. 
The poorer class must have existence, 
So — -- don't push them close to the wall 
Now hope that in future, the richer 
On the poorer will smile and not frown. 
Who ask but enough just to live on. 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital. etc

Alt! 
ve1l we remember when poor mother died, 
They laid her to rest where the green willows wave, 
How grandmother comforted us when we cried, 
Tenderly led us away from the grave. 
How patient, and gentle, and kind she's been, 
Her love for us ne'er can be told ; 
Oh, may her life's evening be calm and serene, 
Don't leave ipoor grandmother, now she is old. 
Don't leave, etc. 
The old village school.house that stands on the hill,

Her tenderness, richer than gold.

We'll not leave grandmother, now she is old.

My golden-hair'd darlings, disturb not their rest, 
Sweet Angels have lull'd them to sleep on my breast; 
O'er their calm slumbers a 
vigil they keep, 
My babes feel no hunger while buried in sleep. 
Whene'er they awake, my fond heart, in its dread, 
Grows sick in the fear that I 
cannot find bread 
To give to my dear ones, so please let them rest; 
While Angels are watching them, slumber is best, 
Citorms. 
Tread softly, speak lightly, disturb not their rest, 
While Angels are guarding them, slumber is best. 
Hunger is bitter, while slumber is sweet, 
Wake not my darlings, they've nothing to eat. 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
They say there is plenty and peace in the land, 
And that charity gives with a 
lavishing hand; 
Notwithstanding that church spires point to the skies, 
Wealth fattens on plenty, while poverty dies! 
There's one, by whose aid the sparrows are fed, 
And I've prayed unto him for our daily bread; 
I 
feel that I'm going my Saviour to meet, 
Where I'll riot see my darlings want something to eat!

A

The girl I 
thought would be my wife, 
Has proved so false to me. 
She's turned me up, and now walks out, 
With one she calls her swain,

And nearly turned my brain 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I'm mad. 
To think the girl— the only one I 
ever loved—should give me up for another. 
And—

If I

Would be, 
To fight fot my country, and be revenged on she. 
Then if a 
war broke out, she'd never see me more, 
But away, yes away, I'd go off to the war. 
The donkey rides I've had with her, 
The shrimps, the lovely teas, 
And trousers that cost twelve and six, 
I've worn out at the knees; 
Through making love, like fellows do, 
In some secluded spot; 
But all iny spooning was in vain. 
The girl she loved inc not. 
SPOKES. — She loved another. 
A. woman that would fool a 
man that had paid sixpence in one day for ginger beer and don-
key rides, is not worthy the name of woman. 
She's—well, 
never mind. 
If I

At night I 
dream of battle fields, 
And fancy I 
am there, 
With blood all round, and cannon balls 
All flying in the air; 
And on the field I 
met the wretch, 
Who's caused our love to part, 
And as we're standing face to face, 
I 
stab him through the heart. 
SPOKEN.—Ha! ha! ha! 
I 
stab him to the heart. 
If I

Short soldiers at the seat of war, 
Have gained old England fame, 
And p'raps Joe Smith of Seven Dials,

May see my name inscribed, 
In the annals of her country, ha, 
Among the brave that died.

Some boys would stealing apples go, 
While others used to stray; 
Down on the docks where sugar casks, 
In rows together lay; 
But Sal and I 
would seek the spot, 
So dear to us of yore; 
And side- by side together slide 
Down Old Grimes' Cellar Door. 
Oh! I

change came o'er the scene,

His son removed the cellar door, 
On which we used to slide. 
Our mothers they were glad of it, 
For our pantaloons we tore; 
They had to he half-soled and heeled. 
From sliding on the door. 
Oh ! I 
would, & e. 
One day the old man fell asleep. 
Upon his cellar door; 
The boys all came to take a 
peep, 
And hear him loudly snore; 
They tickled his nose with feather and straw 
And laughed till their sides were sore, 
The old man awoke with a 
loud haw! haw! 
And slid down on his own cellar door. 
Oh I

My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf, 
So it stood ninety years on the floor; 
It was taller by half than the old man himself, 
Though it weighed not a 
pennyweight more. 
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born,) 
And was always his treasure and pride; 
But it stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
CHORUS. 
Ninety years, without slumbering, tick, tick, tick, tick, ' 
His life-seconds numbering, tick, tick, tick, tick, 
It stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
In watching its pendulun swing to and fro, 
Many hours bad he spent while a 
boy ; 
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know, 
And to share both his grief and his joy, 
For it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door 
With a 
blooming and beautiful bride; 
But it stopped short— never to go again— 
When the old man died.

THE DAY WE LEFT THE OLD DART. 
Written by JOHN SHEEHAN, and sung by SHEEHAN S
.: JONES in 
their original Irish Comedy Farce, entitled " The Day 
we left the Old Dart." 
In dear old Ireland we were born. 
It's many years ago; 
And raised up in sweet Monaghan, 
It's the place where were from, oh. 
We 
-came over in the ship called Dreadnaught, 
From friends we had to part: 
It caused us both to weep and wail. 
When we left the Old Dart. 
CHORUS. 
We are poor old Irish green horns, 
It was hard for us to part; 
It caused its both to weep and wail, 
When we left the Old Darr. 
The morning the ship left Liverpool dock. 
Our poor mother did say, 
"God bless ye, me darling children. 
For you're going to America; 
You are going across the ocean," 
We thought of it on the spot, 
We often sit down and curse the day, 
When we left the Old Dart. 
We are poor, etc.

'Twas going to the Central Park, 
To take the country air,. 
And see the fishes and the swans, 
And other sights so rare, 
I

That pierced me through and through, 
And made me feel so very queer, 
I 
scarce knew what to do. 
CHORUS. 
She was all the heart could fancy, 
And lovely as a 
queen, 
And just about the gayest of the gay; 
And it was her pair of roguish eyes, 
That pierced me thro' and thro' and giro' 
And charmed my heart and senses all away. 
(Dance.) 
Her dress was made in the latest style, 
And trimmed with charming taste, 
She wore a 
brilliant necklace, too, 
Of diamonds—made of paste; 
Her golden hair in ringlets fell, 
Around her lovely neck, 
And since her charming face I've seen, 
My heart's a 
perfect wreck. .

Came ')rily to deceive Inc, 
For another girl, that no one knew, 
Made him go away and leave me.

Oh . he was such a

Ile charmd me quite, at the very first sight! 
He could give my heart delight, 
He was such a 
nice young man! 
He used to sit down by my side, 
And- talk so sweet the while; 
lie pressed my hand within his own, 
And saw inc sweetly smile. 
He brought me roses fresh and fair. 
And loved to see me smell them; 
then friends now ask me, why I'm sad' 
can only smile and tell thorn— 
Oh ! he was, ,S7,c. 
We sang sweet songs and when we talked. 
Our conversation dwelt 
On everything beneath the sun, 
Except what most we felt. 
Sometimes he asked me for a

And how could I 
refuse hint? 
I 
never, never, never thought 
That I 
so soon should lose him. 
Oh! he was, ius.

Heedless of the hours that come and go.

And the leaflets nodding up above 
Were the only ones that list to what we'd say, 
As we whispered o'er our tales of love.

Where the waters ripple soft and low; 
Sitting by my darling, in a

Heedless of the hours that come and go. 
Down among the daisies we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream ; 
Naught will ever come to break the happy spell, 
Break the happy glimmer of our dream. 
Days may come and go, like flowers that bloom and die, 
But as long as life is with us queen, 
We will dwell together, you and I, 
Down among the daisies by the stream.

While the sad cry of hard times resound through our laud 
Do we give enough thought to the poor; 
Are we one and all ready to lend helping hand, 
To drive the grim wolf from the door. 
The selfish may think that kind fortune has dealt. 
With them and theit own to secure 
The comforts and blessings that money can bring, 
But God help our suflering poor. 
There are plenty we meet who could help if they would, 
But the fact is their money's all spent; 
They're too poor themselves, or they ain't in the mood, 
Or some other excuse they'll invent. 
But ask you rich banker how much in his vaults 
These men have placed there to secure; 
And he'll tell you, if honest, their assertions are ialse, 
They could help our suffering poor. 
Can any one tell why those seeking for aid 
Always pass mi2ionaires with distrust? 
Can it be solemn truth, what I've often heard said, 
That the rich seldom give e'en a 
crust? 
But there's the mechanic and laboring man, 
Ever ready to share his small store, 
For nearly each one knows how ' tis himself, 
God bless these true friends to the poor.

So let come -what may, let us laughing' say, 
It's bad, but it might have been worse. 
When an innocent yoUth, with my head full of love

found out one day, 
That she'd married another instead. 
Yes, she married a 
drunkard, and a

Though she jilted me cruel, I

There are some men I've seen whohave conat-nntly been 
Endeavoring to stir up much strife, 
By persuading their fellow-men never to be 
Satisfied with their station in life; 
They say " go on strike, and you'll zet what on like," 
And to order and peace seem averred ; 
Now, if they'd come to me, I'd tell them you see, 
" 
Things are bad, but you've made them worse." 
Now e'er I 
retire I'd like to inspire, 
A 
feeling of gayety here ; 
Then a 
fig for ad trouble ne'er care for to-morrow, 
Nor for what it may bring, have no fear, 
Though the clouds are in sight, it will one day be bright, 
Now when you remember my verse, 
When I 
go away, I 
hope you won't say, 
He was bad, but he might have been worse. 
WHAT THE OLD dOCK SPARROW SAIL; 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense appla 
One (lay I 
took a 
walk, rambling thro' the Central Park, 
It was at the close of a 
bright Autumn day, 
To enjoy the evening breeze as it swift sped thro' the trees, 
And watch the fountain's water brightly play. 
After walking once around, r 
rustic bench I 
found, 
And sitting down a 
moment just to rest, 
When a 
voice I 
heard above, saying 
Soon to you 
prove 
That honesty of purpose is the best.• 
As I 
looked up with surprise, a 
strange sight met iny eye, 
Some fifty sparrows gathered o'er my head; 
A big cock sparrow spoke, with age his feathers broke, 
And this was what the old cock sparrow said. 
" ' Tis strange such things to hear, we are getting worse each 
year, 
The laboring man new Cannot get a 
meal, 
About fifty cents a 
day is all they earn for pay, 
Its no wonder that the poor man ha's to steal. 
And our parsons do not preach, or longer virtue teach, 
At secret kissing they are most expert; 
And our politicians all for their living shout 
4 
bawl, 
And talk of nothing but that bloody shirt. 
And our lecturers who roam, like naughty men from home, 
Through sleeping cars in dreams be blindly led, 
Like Tilton, sweet to furl his arms 'round some pretty girl!" 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
"To the demagogues who dare talk again of civil war, 
On the Fourth of March ' twill be all right, I 
sa) 
Boss Tweed is back again from that dirty land called Spain, 
And I 
hope that in confinement he'll not stay. 
For. supposing he did rob, no poor man wanted a 
job, 
He took it from the rich to give the poor! 
- 
I'd rather run the risk, ho ruled by men like hint and Fisk, 
For then no beggars hungered at your door. 
Of such things soon we'll tire, look at the great Brooklyn fire; 
They condemned the theatres—when the folks were dead! 
Had they done it but before, we should not the lire deplore"— 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
" 
In the election long since gone, none knows which man has 
11:011, 
They did the " counting" just themselves to please; 
Let Returning Boards net fair, and do things on the square, 
And we care not if it's Tilden or it's Hayes. 
But one thing we must see, in this land so great and free, 
That work fn plenty shall be got for all; 
And the scoundrels who would lower the wages of the poor,' 
how quickly we will send them to the wall r 
At this a 
shout did rise, which ascended to the skies, 
From the sparrows that did flutter o'er my head; 
They said his words were right, as they flew into the night, 
And they voted all the old cock sparrow said.

MY OWN PECULIAR STYLE, 
ARTISTIC SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by BEN COLLINS. 
Don't talk of new sensations, 
For I'm sure I 
take the lead. 
And ere I'm done most everyone, 
Will say I'm right indeed; 
Just watch me for a 
moment 
And your sorrows I'll beguile, 
Ill try my best to please you with 
My own fantastic style. 
Watch the motion I'll go through. (Break) 
1 
lere's another that s 
quite new, 
(Breda) 
I'm happy when I'm dancing, 
And it never seems a 
trial. 
To amuse you with my singing and 
My own peculiar style. 
(Piece.) 
I'm always fond of music, 
I 
could listen all day long. 
I 
love to play my harp and sing 
To all this happy throng; 
I 
am different from every one, 
So just listen for awhile, 
And I'll show you something neater. 
In my own peculiar style. 
Watch the motion, etc. 
I 
do not sing of beauties, 
But 
leave it all to you. 
Is there anything as graceful 
As the motion of my shoe? 
You can search the world all over. 
You can travel mile and mile, 
And you'll find I've not an equal 
In my own peculiar style. 
Watch the motion, etc.
