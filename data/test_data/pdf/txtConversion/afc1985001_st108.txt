There's More Pretty Gals Than One
THERE'S MORE PRETTY GALS THAN ONE 5116 B3
Wayne Dinwiddie Visalia, 1941
There's more purty girls than one There's more purty girls than one For every town I've
rambled around There's more purty girls than one.
My mama told me last night She gave me good advice Better stop your ramblin' a round
d , purty boy, And marry you a lovin' wife.
Look down than lonesome road 2 Hang down your little head and cry For thinkin' of their
them purty little girls and who been hopin' I never will would die.
Look down that lonesome road Before you travel on I'm leavin' you this lonesome song To
sing when I am gone.
There's more purty girls than one There's more putty girls than one For every town I've
rambled a roun d There's more putty girls then one.
