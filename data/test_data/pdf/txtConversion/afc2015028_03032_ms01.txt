It’s the 26th of October, I’m up in the northern part of Tucson, talking with Walter Ram, 
Sr., who is going to talk to me a little bit today about produce and transportation; that’s his 
background. Walter Ram, Jr. is Walter Ram, Sr.’s son, whom I spoke with earlier. Before I turned 
the recording on, you were telling me about how in Nogales, there was no refrigeration, and 
there were only a few things that were coming out of town…?  
 
WRS 
Right. When I got into it, produce was coming into Nogales. Produce has been coming 
into Nogales out of Mexico, oh, since about, that I know of, 1916. And one of those involved in 
there happened to be, by coincidence, my future father-in-law. You see, a Greek by the name of 
Harry Georgelos [sp], who came here from Greece, and he had his brother go down to Culiacán 
and grow tomatoes, and he had a sales office here in town, Nogales, and there he would sell 
them. But at that time, it was a lot different doing that. Like, today, everybody’s got a warehouse, 
and they sell this, and they sell…at that time, they had just an office, no warehouse, no workers, 
nothing. Just an office with a salesman and a secretary. And they sold their tomatoes by 
telephone. If they happened to get in, say, five cars of tomatoes at a time, which was a lot at that 
time, they would sell maybe one or two cars, and then they had the other ones, and they had to 
move them because tomorrow they would get some more. So what they would do, they would 
roll them open without sales, mainly to Kansas City, which was a staging area with ice and 
instructions for the road; ice in Nogales, ice in El Paso, and so on. And then as they sold it, they 
would divert it. They would go to the railroad company here in Nogales, and they’d put in a 
diversion order to ship the car going to Kansas City, get it and ship it up to Denver, or ship it up 
to the Carolinas, or wherever they happened to sell it at. But that’s the way they used to sell 
things out here. So when I started, I first started the trucking deal when I first came out of 
school, the school that I was telling you about, the college in California… 
 
NH 
Yeah, Woodbury.  
 
WRS 
Woodbury College. But when I came out here, when I came after school, I was flat broke. 
So in school, nobody helped me. They couldn’t, that’s why they didn’t help me financially, so I 
went to college and I worked my way through for my room, for my meals, for my clothing, for 
everything. And so when I came out of there, I was not in debt. I didn’t owe a penny, but I didn’t 
have a penny either. So when I first came over, I knew what I wanted to do. I had been to Mexico 
once before, to the growing areas, once before with George Gotsis in 1945, when we both came

out of the service, I saw him in Nogales (we were both from Nogales), and he invited me, he was 
going down to visit his parents in Mexico. So I went, we took the train, and I went down there. 
And I saw what was going on out there. That’s before I went to college, that’s when I just came 
out of the service. So I saw the farm, and saw it was primitive at the time, shall we say, in a sense. 
So I came rback, and I went off to college, and four years later or so, when I came back from 
college, I was broke, and I went to work in a mine in Tucson here. I was working in the office of 
the mine. I used to take care of all the pay, figuring out the pay, I should say, for the workers. I 
used to go down in the shafts, [four hundred level], I did. It was very interesting. I still had in 
mind, I wanted to go into the trucking deal. But I didn’t know how to do it. So by that time, I had 
a…I used a Pontiac car. And one day, I met the salesman that sold International Trucks in 
Nogales. He was a very nice fellow. And somehow I made a deal for him; I’d give him my car as a 
trade-in, as a down payment, I should say, on a tractor. On a truck. And some way or another, 
which I don’t recall how, from a bank in Phoenix that I knew no one in, the Bank of Douglas in 
Phoenix, that I knew no one in in there. And I went out there and they loaned me money. No 
collateral, no nothing. And I bought a trailer. And so I had a truck and trailer, and I knew what I 
had to do, but I didn’t have enough money to hire a driver or to pay my fuel and my expenses to 
go on a trip. So my sister loaned me, I think it was two hundred dollars. And with the two 
hundred dollars, I went on a first trip. I went down to Culiacán, Mexico. Six hundred miles down. 
I’d never been all the way down there. And there was a Mexican fellow across the line, in 
Nogales, Mexico, that was supposed to go with me and show me the way, show me which route 
to take and this and that. But when I went to pick him up, he never showed up. So I figured if I’m 
going to do it later on, I’m going to do it now. So I went by myself. And it was quite an 
experience. Because the road was paved about halfway, down to about Navojoa, Mexico. And 
from there on, I’d say about 20 miles south of Navojoa, the pavement ended. And there were 
nothing but trails. Every time it rained, people would…cars would go a different route, they’d 
make their different diversions and so and so, and when you came to rivers, you forded the 
rivers of waters up to the running board.  
 
[6:41] 
 
 
[slight pause] When it was too high, you crossed over the railroad tracks. They had put planks 
on there so cars could go by so I would go by in that truck. I went down without knowing which 
way to go, until finally, finally, finally I got to Culiacán. It took almost 24 hours to get there. And 
when I got to Culiacán, and went and parked in front of a hotel—Culiacán wasn’t that big in, I’m 
talking about 1952-and I was dying for a cup of coffee. I’ve always been a coffee drinker all my 
life, I would die for a cup of coffee. And so I parked the truck and started walking to the hotel, 
and there was a guy leaning on the pillar at the front of the hotel, smoking, and when I got close 
to him, he said, “Is that your rig?” And I told him, “Yes it is!” And he says, “How about a cup of 
coffee?” And this is what I wanted, and that fellow became a very good friend of mine. He was a 
Safeway buyer. Safeway buyer in Culiacán. And so anyway, I forget how I got my first 
connections, but I loaded for him, for Eddie Reese [sp]. I loaded green tomatoes from the grower 
that later would become, in Nogales, became [slight pause, tapping of fingers] I’ll tell you in a 
minute, I’ve got to remember that. I loaded green tomatoes, and I took them all the way to Los 
Angeles. There was no place to unload in Nogales, there were no warehouses. No distribution of 
any kind. So I would take it to Los Angeles. And I kept on doing that, going back and forth, and I 
got to know the road better. But it was rough all the time. In my truck, in the saddle tanks, I had 
a shovel. I carried and axe. I carried a pick. Because on some of the roads out there, the cars 
would go by, were too narrow for the truck. So I’d have to go widen a little if it was at nighttime, 
I would shine the lights of the tractor on there, and that would make a wider road so that I could 
continue. It was rough. I hauled tomatoes like that. I hauled shrimp in a little trailer that had no 
refrigeration except a [putt putt], you know what a putt putt is, they have an ice bunker and a

blower. And it’s only for vegetables. But I used to haul, in Culiacán, when they loaded me the 
shrimp, I used to put dry ice on top of the load. And I’d drive all the way to Nogales, non stop to 
Nogales, sleepy as all heck, and I’d get to the ice plant in Nogales that I knew had dry ice. I would 
put dry ice, go home, shower, change. My wife would fix me a box lunch—we had just gotten 
married—and I would take off for Los Angeles. And my load would be not as cold as it was, but 
not as frozen as it was when I left Culiacán, but after 1200 miles and 48 hours—24 and 24—the 
shrimp was okay. You’d put ‘er in the [blast freeze]. And so, I hauled several loads of shrimp like 
that. And like I said, at that time, there were no trucks and trailers. I was by myself. When I came 
to Nogales, there was no compounds, no unloading, no nothing like that. I would come over close 
to the border, I would open the door, take out a sample, and take it over to the [customs]. And 
they would check it, and I would put it back in again, close my doors, lock it again, and come to 
the American side, and I would do my crossing and my everything. Of course, the customers took 
care of the paperwork. And again, I’d go to Los Angeles. But it was rough, because I would drive 
four nights in a row, then get back home and sleep one night. I would drive four nights: one 
going to Culiacán, one coming back to Nogales, one going to Los Angeles, and one back to 
Nogales. Four nights. I would sleep in the seat of the truck when I could. I would sleep under the 
trailer when they were unloading me or loading me, I would…it was a rough year. And I did it 
the whole year. And that second year, I started, but by that second year, I was already saving a 
few dollars. Because my only expenses were the truck itself. The fuel, but not…so I was saving a 
few dollars. But I was very tired. And by that time, we had Walter, who was just a brand new 
baby…maybe Steve, my second boy…but there was one fellow who lived in Tijuana, Mexico, but 
he was immigrated. He lived in Tijuana, but he had immigration. And he would meet me in Los 
Angeles every time I went there, because he wanted a job. He wanted a job trucking. And I was 
collecting money, saving money, so I would tell him no, no. Until one time I was coming back 
from Culiacán, and a hundred miles from Nogales, I fell asleep driving. And I drove, I don’t know 
how far out into the desert without turning, and finally the bouncing from the rocks and what 
not woke me up. And luckily I didn’t force the wheel. I came to a stop. So that woke me up. So I 
drove back close to the highway and I slept on the wheel for about an hour, hour and a half, and I 
came on in. When I came to Nogales, I called the guy in Tijuana and I told him “Meet me in Los 
Angeles”. I knew I couldn’t do it anymore. Meet me in Los Angeles. So when I got there, he was 
there, with his suitcase and everything else. And after that, I only made one more driving trip to 
Culiacán to show him what I had to do out there. And after that, I bought me two trailers and 
two trucks, and I got some other drivers, and they were doing all the hauling for me, and so on. I 
could see what was going on, and the fellows that I used to deliver to in Los Angeles, I used to 
tell them, “Why don’t you open an office in Nogales?” And that was Child Brothers. Before Child 
brothers, their name was Royal Fruit and Produce Company. And then when Harold Child took 
control of it, they changed the name to Child Brothers. I told him, “Why don’t you open one in 
Nogales instead of bringing it back to Los Angeles, and you shipping it back east or wherever. 
“It’ll never work, it’ll never work,” they told me. The next year, they were building a warehouse 
in Nogales. And then it started exploding, it started building up.  
 
[13:55] 
 
Competition got strong on my traders and so and so, and you know, I had to get bigger, and I 
couldn’t do it that fast. So I took in two partners. One partner was from Nogales, and the other 
one was a brother of the fellow that married President Alemán’s daughter in Mexico City. So we 
had pull in Mexico then. And we needed that to get permits to import American traders into 
Mexico. So he would get us our permits, and we would do all the…Herman and I, the two of us, 
did the work in Nogales. And the other Mexican partner was just the one that got us our permits 
and whatnot. And so we grew. At one time, we had seventy traders, and we had, oh, I don’t 
know, about twenty tractors or whatnot, and the rest of it we used to lease our power. And in 
Mexico, we used to lease all the power. We stopped going with our tractors to Mexico; too much

trouble, too many federal police, and permits and this and that and whatnot. So we got a 
Mexican company out of Mexico City. [unclear] Which worked out real good. All our pull in 
Mexico. And from here, our tractors would go to Los Angeles, would go to San Francisco, a 
couple of times to Denver and El Paso. We wanted to go farther than that, and the whole thing 
cooked real good. It went like that for years, until my American partner started changing 
altogether. He started changing for the worse, you know. And I won’t go into details, but finally, 
it came to the point where we owed the banks in Nogales. One bank we owed $30,000, and the 
other bank we owed $20,000, which was little for what we had sent them, so I couldn’t do it 
anymore, because I was running the company by myself. There was other things that were just, 
you could not work with them that way. I offered to sell my part to them, and they said no. And 
then I offered to buy them all out. By that time I could do it! I had been saving all my money, and 
I did quite well there. And they wouldn’t do it. So I told them, I tell you what, absolve me from 
those two loans we have at the bank, and you keep everything. I had an [unclear] ready and 
everything else like that, and so that’s what we did. They absolved me. I knew the company was 
going down. I gave them two years in my mind, I said two years, they’d be gone. In two years, 
they were gone. They went broke. They just wouldn’t take care of it and whatnot. So anyway, 
from there, I went into the produce deal. To the selling, and then later on I had my growers in 
Mexico. But it’s difficult, because growers in Mexico are very difficult. The people that are lucky 
and hit it a lot easier. It was people like Gatzionis, for instance.  Because they had their office, but 
they were their own growers. It’s ideal. Me, I had to go get Joe and Bill and so and so, Mexican 
farmers, and then I’d give them the seed, and then I’d provide all the money for their labor and 
everything, which amounted to quite a bit of money. At that time, for me, it was a lot. I used to 
put in about $300-$350,000 down there that I borrowed from the banks. And you can see that I 
was building up [unclear]. But it was always difficult. And finally, I called it quits. I called it quits 
in Mexico, and became a buying broker in Nogales. And that’s the way my story is. But the 
trucking part of it was very interesting. When we started with RGR, that’s when they started 
building the compounds. And of course, I did build one, it’s an old one they’re using now. They 
have a new one they have today. The trucks would come out there, the line trucks would leave 
the trailers across the line, the loaded trailers, and we had what we called goats, the local 
tractors, that just go pick them up and bring them over to this side, and then deliver the empty 
trailer back across the line. And we did it like that for quite a while, but the first one to open up 
here in Nogales, a warehouse, was Child Brothers. I don’t know who their warehouse now, but 
it’s in Nogales itself, it’s by Mariposa Drive, it’s in the north end of Nogales here, by, what’s in 
that corner? It’s a gas station that’s in that corner out there.  
 
[19:05] 
 
NH: I’m trying to figure it out in my mind where it might be. I’m thinking…Mariposa?  
 
WRS: I don’t know… 
 
NH: Chamberlain?  
 
WRS: When you go into…you know where Chamberlain’s at?  
 
NH: Yeah.  
 
WRS: Okay, when you drive and you’re going to Chamberlain, instead of going over the bridge, 
you make a left turn. That’s where…she’s getting to know you now.  
 
NH: That’s okay.

WRS: That’s where the warehouse is at. And then, now the guy built a warehouse next to that. 
But that was the first warehouse in Nogales. And George Gotsas used to be way downtown, I call 
it downtown, and then he built his own. George has done a good job in building up his company. 
His father used to be the farmer down there in [Sinaloa], and he’s another family deal. So 
he’s…George is…I seldom see him, but he’s a good friend of mine, George is. [slight pause] So any 
question you want to ask me?  
 
NH: No, you’ve just been telling me about the transportation, which I find, you’re the first person 
I’ve really gotten a chance to talk to. You said you were talking about the challenges of it, of 
course, staying awake seemed like…the physical aspect of it when you were actually driving 
seemed like it was pretty intense.  
 
WRS: Later on, I had my own plane, I flew a Cessna for, I don’t know, maybe I put in about a 
thousand hours on it, and then switched into a little faster one, the Beechcraft Bonanza, the one 
with the V-tail. I flew that down there, I was sort of a bush pilot. I would land on the little dirt 
roads and everything else like that. I knew how to do it, and you had to be pretty alert to do it, 
not to hit trees or whatnot as you were taking off, because the strips were short. And they were 
a little on the rough side, but I did pretty well. I used to fly over ther, I used to fly to Los Angeles, 
I used to fly to Sky Harbor in Phoenix, I used to fly to Limburgh Field in San Diego. You know, the 
Limburgh field was the one I enjoyed the most. That’s where you fly real low, there’s building 
and so and so, you fly through the buildings. You’ve been through there?  
 
NH: No, I haven’t been to San Diego yet.  
 
WRS: No? If you ever fly there, just remember me. I used to fly my little plane, and I used to…this 
is later on…I used to fly…this is about ten years later, in the sixties. I used to call in when I was 
going in, I’d call the tower and say “this is Bonanza so-and-so, and I’m over at Murphy Field”, 
which is their football field at that time, it used to be Murphy Football Field. And they’d tell me 
to go to old town, and report an old town (that’s another part of San Diego). Then they’d line me 
up to go up there, and then make my final, base leg and then final. But when they put me into 
final, they’d put me in between the big jets. So I’d have a jet in front of me, and a jet behind me, 
and there was a little plane. And I couldn’t get too close to the first one on account of their drafts, 
and I had to be careful that the bigger guy behind me didn’t catch up to me. And so, I’d land, and 
they were telling me to turn to your right on your first turnoff, and that was where the small 
planes went to. So I’d go down there and, I forget the name of the place there now, but it was 
very interesting. I used to go there, I used to go over in Fullerton, California.  I used to go to 
Denver, only a couple of time. I had to go to El Paso. But most of my flying was in Mexico.  
 
NH: So you were flying as part of work?  
 
WRS: For work, for work. Down in Mexico to see the fields, and out here, San Diego. Sometimes I 
used to go out there just to spend a few days with my family down there, take them out there. 
But up north, to go see different people and whatnot. But most of it was work.  
 
NH: Now you started in the fifties. How long did you work? Like you said, you worked in the 
transportation, but then you were working with brokers. How long were you working down 
there?  
 
WRS: Ah, well, I started on my own, and then in the season 1956-57, which is mostly ’57, we 
were the big company. The partnership company. And that ended in 1968. In 1968, I couldn’t 
take any more, so that’s when I pulled out of…my doctor told me, he knew what I was doing, and 
he says, “Walter,” he says, Dr. [Leturn], I remember. He says, “I can cure you of what you have

right now, but you’re going to be back here again. Do something else but what you’re doing right 
now. Get out of it.” And so I got out of it. My health comes first. And I wasn’t thinking of myself, I 
was thinking of my family. Like when I fell asleep driving, I wasn’t thinking of myself. I used to 
work so much and I used to get so tired, and put in long hours. One time coming back from 
Culiacán to Nogales, in the plane, I fell asleep. I had it on auto-pilot. And I don’t know how long I 
slept, could have been an hour, I don’t know how long I slept! And when I woke up, it scared the 
living daylights out of me. So I quit doing it. I quit flying when I was tired. [slight pause] But you 
know, my life story, to me it’s very interesting what things I have done.  
 
NH: People have…I’ve talked to several people, they talk about just the grueling schedule, and 
it’s so fast-paced when the season is on for working in produce. I was talking to a guy who was a 
warehouse manager, and he literally said, yeah, we’re here 16-18 hours a day, six days a week 
during the season. We like the overtime, but the hours are long. People said that lifestyle gets in 
your blood. People said, a lot of people really have gotten used to the pace of it, I guess.  
 
[25:42] 
 
WRS: And here’s another thing, now that you mention that. [slight pause] If you want some 
coffee, all I have to do is flip the switch on… 
 
NH: No, no, this is my second cup, so I’m going to have to cut myself off for the day.  
 
WRS: I drink ten cups of coffee a day, easy.  
 
NH: I once had one interview with somebody at lunch where they drank three cups of coffee at 
lunch. I can’t…like, last night, I had a third cup, I was over at a friend’s house in Marana, I think I 
woke up seven times in the night!  
 
WRS: I drink coffee before I go to bed at nighttime.  
 
NH: There’s a movie, I don’t know which one it was, where a guy said he drinks coffee before bed 
so he dreams faster.  
 
WRS: [laughs] 
 
NH: But you were talking about the sort of fast-paced nature of the… 
 
WRS: Right. When we first started in the [unclear] deal, there were no pallets. Nothing was 
palletized. Everything was by box. The warehouses in Mexico, when they loaded a truck, if a 
package was ready, they’d put it on the truck. So when they got here, you had to unload package 
by package. And aside from packages, you’d have to put piles…you needed a lot of space because 
you had to separate the sizes, then you had to separate the colors. If one was just breaking, or if 
one was medium, or one had more color. The ones that had the most color, you had to sell closer 
by. And they used to take, there’s a lot of time we’d put in 16-18 hours. Lots of times! I 
remember a couple of times, we slept on our desk. It was almost light in the morning, we were 
so tired to go home, we slept on the desk. And then when we could break in the daytime, then 
we’d go home and shower, change, and come back again. The hours used to be  long. But we 
were making money, though, see. We were making money, so we didn’t mind it. And the 
workers…we had [slight pause] Aside from our trucks, we had a warehouse. I don’t know if you 
know Nogales, there’s a Mexican restaurant in the middle of town, closer in town, that’s elevated 
and…do you know where Basha’s is? Not Basha’s, but Food City in Nogales? Across the street, 
there’s a restaurant…

NH: I’m trying to figure it out in my mind. I actually know the Safeway, but not the Food City.  
 
WRS: Anyway, it was…that used to be a mechanical shop. A welding shop and all that. And this 
partner of mine and I, we bought the building, and we braced the walls, filled it up with dirt, put 
a platform high…made a warehouse. Made three warehouses out of it. And we had regular 
coolers on the roof, one for each one of them. And so we used to rent them. Now, to get workers 
to work as long as they did, and to get them to work on weekends, especially on Sunday, now 
they were all just workers, no schooling, shall we say. I don’t want to talk bad about them, but 
no, no schooling. So what we used to do, we used to offer them…we used to have a bottle of 
tequila. You know what that is, tequila?  
 
NH: Oh, of course. Yeah, yeah. 
 
WRS: …For each one of them. But only after they got through working on Sundays and stuff like 
that. And when they got through, we’d give them the bottle. God only knows how much they 
drank of it, or if they didn’t drink, but we had our work done. And when they wouldn’t do it, we 
were in there unloading trucks and loading trucks and whatnot. So like I say, but we were 
making money. I gave my family a good life. My wife came from a good…well, a good family I 
knew, but shall we say, when I married her, I was broke, and she came from a well-to-do family. 
And I always give her credit that she came to me when she knew that…when we left, after we got 
married in the church and went and had our pictures taken, I had $38 in my bank account. 
That’s the way I started the whole deal, see. No, my kids went to the schools they wanted to. 
High school, they went to Villanova, it’s a college prep high school in California. So in other 
words, I gave them a good life, see, you know? Because I grew up in the Depression. But growing 
up in the Depression, we’re getting away from the trucking deal… 
 
NH: No, no, this is all good!  
 
WRS: Growing up in the Depression, in a sense prepared me for what was going to happen to me 
in the future, which I didn’t know. This is all before school, before produce, before trucks. The 
Depression, and from there I went into the military. Now, when we were bombing Germany, we 
were shot down twice. One time, we made it back to England, where we crashed. I’ll show you a 
picture of the plane. The second time, we were way deep inside Germany, by the Baltic Sea…I 
don’t know if you know where the Baltic… 
 
NH: I’ve been to, I lived in Estonia.  
 
WRS: Oh! You know where…well, the Baltic Sea, on the other side. On the Denmark side of the 
Baltic Sea. And we were bombing Kiel, that’s on the Baltic Sea side of the peninsula, and we were 
shot down. And that’s where six out of ten of my crew members died, including this friend of 
mine [unclear] Hamilton, from Canada. And so, I had to go to a hospital. I was in a hospital for 
four months, in the prison hospital. But they had captured me, right. But anyway, we suffered a 
lot from a lack of food. In the two years I spent as a prisoner, we suffered from lack of food, from 
cold weather. We slept in beds, the same type that you’ve seen on television, where the 
Holocaust prisoners were at, those wooden deals. Exactly the same. Same blueprint. No 
mattress, just the wood. A plank for a pillow. We had one skinny blanket and one overcoat, and 
we were in Austria. Our Stalag XVII was in Austria, and that’s where we were at. And it’s cold out 
there. Cold, cold. And our big windows, the windows were all shattered, from bombing or 
whatever. There was no glass in the windows, just the opening. And here’s the barracks, and 
these were the walls, and our bunks were lined up here, and the wind would come in through 
this window, out the other window, and we were in between there. And the snow was so high all

winter long outside. We were cold. So having been brought up in the Depression, we didn’t 
suffer lack of food during the Depression, but we had no toys or nothing like that, see, you know? 
But in a sense, it prepared me, because, I’m not talking about, I don’t know where the other ones 
came from, prepared me for a difficult life. And so, I made the two years out there, and came 
back, and when I came back, one of the smartest things I ever did in my life was having gone 
back to school. Because after you’ve been out of school for about six years, you don’t go back to 
high school, see, you know? I don’t know why I did it. I guess I had promised my mother, when I 
first took off when I was 16. At that time, I joined before I was of age to join, so I scratched out 
my birth certificate, and put it on there. Today you could not do it because of the computers. At 
that time, I would just scratch it, and the recruiters didn’t care really. My biggest problem that I 
had was making the weight. You had to weigh 118 pounds, and I only weight 116 pounds. I was 
5’7”, 116 pounds. I was small. I was just a kid, see. And I went to the infantry, and you have to 
march with that big old heavy pack. The pack weighed sixty pounds, plus our rifle, plus our 
canteen with water. Plus our ammunition. I don’t know how much weight we had… 
 
NH: Almost as much as you, sounds like!  
 
[34:16] 
 
WRS: You know, and I never…in the hot sun, and whatnot, I never folded up, I never gave up or 
whatnot. And the big guys used to respect me, because some of those big guys, big, strong, guys. 
They were old. They were in their twenties. 22, 23, 24 years old. And some of them would just be 
walking, and just pass out. I never passed out. But it was hard. And so, I didn’t want the infantry, 
when the war broke out, I joined the air corps.  But anyway, life has been interesting.  
 
NH: Yeah. Seems like you definitely…because I’ve talked to a lot of guys, you know, who grew up 
with parents in the produce industry. They grew up, like, second, third generation, that sort of 
thing, but you know. they’ve had a very different background, because they’ve gone on to 
college, worked with the families, and the weekends or the summers. But it’s good to know 
about yours, because you didn’t grow up in that. You kind of came into it later, from what it 
sounds.  
 
WRS: Yeah, my father in law, like I said, was in the produce deal. But I didn‘t know him or 
nothing like that, there, of course. He was an old man. He retired in 1944. Hell, when he retired, I 
was still in prison camp in Germany. And Germany was tough. When I went into Germany, I 
weighed 160 pounds. When I came out of Germany two years later, I weighed 97 pounds. I was 
skinny. We went…you’ve heard of the Bataan Death March?  
 
NH: Yeah.  
 
WRS: Well, there were a lot of other marches like that in Germany, but you never heard of them. 
And I’ll tell you why. Because, okay, take Bataan. When the Japs captures all those lands and 
countries and whatnot out there…they captured, of course, the Philippines. When they captured 
the Philippines, they captured the cities, Manilla, and so and so. And the cities had doctors, 
lawyers, Indian chiefs, they had everything in there, including newspapers, photographers, 
correspondents, they had everything. And so they took pictures of some of them, hidden, of 
course, the way we took pictures in Germany, hidden. And they filtered back into the States. 
That’s how the American people knew of the Bataan Death March. Now, in Germany, like in our 
camp, in Stalag XVII, two people were not…we were all military, but only two people were not 
air corps guys that had been fighting and had been shot down, either crashed, survived, or bailed 
out and survived, or whatever. And so nothing was ever photographed, or nothing like that. So 
nothing ever came out here. Now on our march that we took, we marked three hundred miles, a

Page 9 of 23 
lot of people say they marched a thousand miles or so. But they’re exaggerating. Our camp, when 
the Russians were getting too close to us, the Germans didn’t want us to be recaptured. The 
Russians were coming in from the east towards Vienna. We were 45 miles from Vienna. Patton 
was coming in from the west, in Germany, going towards Czechoslovakia and Austria. General 
Clark was coming in from Italy, coming in through what they call the Brenner Pass, that comes 
from Italy into Austria. So the noose was getting small, so they forced us to march out of our 
camp. (Hey, little doggy!) And we marched three hundred miles. Very poorly fed. We used to 
swipe whatever we could on the road out there to survive. We lost, the Gestapo was behind us, 
and we lost…I have it documented. I gotta bring that paper from the other house yet. We lost 
393 guys out of four thousand, almost ten percent, that disappeared. When they wouldn’t march, 
or they couldn’t march, the Gestapo would shoot them. That’s what they did to the Jewish guys 
out there. We saw a whole bunch of Jewish guys that they’d killed out there, see, you know, on 
that same march. On the march, it was rough. You had to keep on going. I lost my shoes, my 
shoes were a little too large for me, too big for me. And the reason for that was that when I was 
shot down, I had my heated suit on, because we used to fly with windows open in our 17s, on 
account of the machine guns. And our temperatures were 50 degrees, on one mission it was 61 
below zero. So we had to have those to survive out there. So when I was shot down, I had my 
heated suit on, which was electrical. So I had something like tennis shoes, which were heated 
also. So I didn’t have any shoes, really. When I woke up…I was unconscious. When I woke up in 
the hospital, I didn’t have anything on me. And somewhere or another, they gave me some 
clothing, military clothing. But shoes, I didn’t have any shoes. So they gave me some Dutch 
wooden clogs. And I went through [unclear] until I got to Berlin with those. In Berlin,, I was in 
the prison hospital, run by British doctors. They were prisoners themselves. They were captured 
in France in 1940, when the Germans ran them out into the sea. And finally, I got some shoes 
there. Some guy died, and they gave me his shoes. But those shoes were a little too long for me, 
too big for me. But they were shoes, so it was good. [unclear] So now, on the march, I still had 
the same shoes. Marching, marching, my feet would slide a little in my shoes. You know, when 
your shoes are not the right size?  
 
[40:19] 
 
NH: Back and forth, yeah.  
 
WRS: And I lost three toenails in each foot. I lost my big toenail, and the next two on one, and my 
big toenail and the next two on the other one. And you could tell when they were, because they 
were hurting, so you’d take your shoes off and your wet socks. Same socks, same shoes, same 
clothing. We marched in the snow, we marched in the rain, we slept on the ground, we slept in 
the snow, we slept in the so and so…frozen ground. And that’s cold, frozen ground, huh? And 
that’s hard. And some place when you’d stop, you’d take your shoes off, and your wet socks, and 
then the nails would be hanging on with a little thread on the side, so you’d get a pocket knife 
and cut the little thread off, and put your dirty socks back on again. And no nail, and keep on 
going. So it was a hard march, it was a hard deal.  
 
NH: Yeah…. [slight pause] 
 
WRS: And we had …the guards were, three different sets of guards. At the beginning, the guards 
were young guys that were real mean, real cruel in our camp. And then as time went by and the 
Germans started losing on the Russian front and whatnot, they took those young guys and gave 
us a little older guys, and they were not as bad as the younger guys, those all hopped-up, 
brainwashed type of guys. And then when D-Day came along, I had been a prisoner for a year 
already, and they started losing more men on both sides. And they took the middle-aged guys, 
should we call them middle-aged, and they gave us the older guys. Say, guys up to their sixties.

And those were the better guys. But not all of them were good, not all of them were bad. But we 
had one guy, from the beginning to the end, Schultz. And he wasn’t like the comedy program that 
they have on the TV, no, this guy was a mean one. He shot a few of our guys in the head, kill ‘em, 
see, yeah? And so, when we were liberated, the guys made sure that he didn’t escape. And we 
had a backpack for ourselves when we were marching to have our overcoat and our blanket and 
our little pots and pans that we had for water that we could find on the road and cook or 
whatever, and so we got one of them, filled it up with rocks, put it on him, and we told him, 
“March. Up and down this dirt road”. We were off the highway, on a dirt road. And told him, 
“Don’t stop. When you stop, you’re going to get shot.” And he understood English, so he started 
marching. He was strong, that guy. Short, stocky, and he was march, march, marching. And we 
would guard him. So many guys would guard him with the rifles that we had from what had 
been our guards. And then, after a while, some other group would take over, go out and look for 
food or whatever, and so, one afternoon, he fell on one knee. And that was it. The guys blasted. 
And they all shot him in the head. Shot him in the head, because that’s where he liked to shoot 
‘em at. Well, actually, the Germans and everybody, the Gestapo, was trained to shoot ‘em in the 
head. One bullet each, and save bullets. They’d put a bullet either here, here, or in the corners, 
shall we say. I saw them shoot from here to where you’re at, a Jewish guy. But that’s another 
story. There’s a lot of stories I’ve got. But anyway, Schultz. And all of us were angry because we 
had not been there to take our turn to shoot him. Of course, today, I’m glad I was not there. But 
at that time, we were full of anger. Our thinking was not the way it was now. Our thinking was, 
we were cruel in our sense, we had a ball of anger inside of us… 
 
[44:25] 
 
NH: Two years. 
 
WRS: It took years to get rid of it. I had to go through the VA psychologist, psychiatrist, group 
meetings. And then they invented the word PTSD, because before the second war, PTSD wasn’t a 
word. It used to be shell shocked. And so anyway, the town, when they liberated us, we were in a 
forest. We were close to a town. And it just so happened that town was where Hitler was born 
and raised. Branau, Austria. It’s on the border of Germany and Austria. What separates the two 
countries is a river, it’s a good-sized river. The Inn River. And we went in town, three of us went 
in town, well, a bunch of guys, but we were in a little group of three. And we were standing in 
front of a house to see where we were going to get food and whatnot, because everybody had 
their doors closed and whatnot. People, there were no people in the streets. And some way or 
another we find out that the building that we were standing at, a two-story building, and the 
buildings came up to the sidewalks. The doors opened, when you stepped out of the house, you 
stepped onto the sidewalk. You’ve seen that type of building, probably out east you see them a 
lot. Baltimore, and places like that, there. Anyway, we came to find out that it was Hitler’s house, 
where he was raised at. So, do you know the anger we had at the time, we wanted to tear this 
building down. We didn’t know what to do, we wanted to tear the building down. If we had had 
hand grenades or what not, we would have broken the windows, because it had two windows at 
the bottom and two windows at the top, and a door in the center. We would have thrown those 
hand grenades. But we didn’t. So the only thing that we could do, we did it. We urinated on the 
walls of the house.  
 
[both laugh] 
 
WRS: We did it hoping that the urine would eat the walls. We were so angry, see. But that’s all 
we did to the house. It still stands today. I saw it in the paper… 
 
NH: I was wondering, yeah…

WRS: I saw in the paper not too long ago that they may tear the house down, because they don’t 
want people…you know, there’s still a lot of Nazis out there. They don’t want them to go and 
make it a shrine or anything.  
 
NH: Like, they tore down Spandau prison.  
 
[46:48] 
 
WRS: And so, we went, and we almost tore a door down on a bakery. It’s a homemade door, 
white door, wood, and it had the little open door up on top. And with the butt of the rifle, we 
banged upon the door. Because we could smell the smell of bread coming out! And after a while, 
the little door opened up on top, the baker opened it up, and when he opened it, there were 
three rifles pointed right at his head. We would have blasted him. We were very angry, see. It 
took a long time to get rid of that anger. He opened up the big ol’ door, we walked in, and they 
had the old style where you get the big ol’ long scoopers and scoop the bread out. So he took 
some bread out of there, they were baking, huh? So he took some out of there. We got some of 
that hot bread. Each one of us got a loaf of bread, and the thing was hot. We couldn’t eat too 
much because our stomachs were too small.  
 
NH: Right, right.  
 
WRS: And so we walked out. We didn’t do anything to them or whatnot, we just walked out. I 
guess that they were glad that we just got some bread rather than destroy anything. And we 
went through town, and broken into a wine cellar carved inside of a little hill. With our rifles, we 
knocked the lock off, and got a bottle of wine out of there. But our systems were so weak that we 
tasted the wine, but we couldn’t drink it. We threw it away and broke the bottles in there. I think 
we broke every single bottle in there. And you remember the old styles where they used to live 
on a five-gallon can of milk, the farmers or somebody would come pick ‘em up? I forget, they 
used to do it in the States here also. Anyway, we ran into one of them. We drank the milk and 
flipped the rest of it out onto the street. We didn’t know what to do. When we were liberated, we 
didn’t know whether to laugh, jump, sing, sit down, cry, or what. We didn’t know what to do. 
Just, we didn’t know what to do. We couldn’t believe it.  
 
NH: I imagine there’s not a lot of guys in Nogales, in the produce industry, who’ve had that same 
ex…probably nobody else has had an experience like that.  
 
WRS: There are no other prisoners in Nogales. The only other one was there was a guy captured 
in the Philippines, and he’s dead now, he’s gone. [slight pause] When I was going to school in Los 
Angeles, when I’d come down home, anyplace that I could make a dollar, I’d do it. My brother 
had a couple of trucks, but I don’t know what he hauled. He hauled stuff, not in Mexico, but here. 
And he had a load of watermelons that he was taking to El Paso. A load of watermelons, I don’t 
know where he got ‘em from, but he was going to El Paso. So I volunteered to drive the truck; I 
didn’t know how to drive a truck. I volunteered to drive the truck because he was going to pay 
me, I forget what it was, thirty or forty dollars, and to me, it was a lot of money, see, you know? 
So I took off. The truck didn’t have air brakes, it had vacuum brakes, which is a different type. So 
I took off. I went to Tucson, fueled up, I had two tanks total of 90 gallons of gas, and then took off 
for El Paso. No freeways or nothing like that. I went through Benson, Wilcox, and all those places 
like that. On the state roads. When I went over by Benson, I went and tried to…the truck had 
hydraulic brakes, they didn’t hold anything. And I had a full load of watermelons. And the trailer 
had a little handle for the trailer brakes. When it started going down at 1 o’clock in the morning, 
I went to try my trailer brakes, and I had no brakes. So I had developed somewhere along the

line a leak, and there wasn’t vacuum anymore. I had no brakes. So I started going down a little 
fast, I thought of jumping out, but I was going too fast and it was pitch black. I’d probably kill 
myself, so I figured I’d ride it down. And luckily from before that, I knew how to get through 
Benson. Because you went down Benson and then had to make a right turn, and a left turn, and 
go under a bridge. If you went straight, you would hit a railroad embankment. And if I were to 
jump that curb or whatever, and I had that embankment, the watermelon load would come up 
and crush me, see? So I had no choice. I had to try and make the turn. I knew I couldn’t make it. A 
highway patrolman followed me. He told me, I don’t know, I wasn’t watching any dials or 
nothing like that, another truck wouldn’t have indicated it didn’t go that far. But he told me that 
he couldn’t pass me. “I went up to 120 and I couldn’t pass you!” he says. So I don’t know how fast 
I was going. I know I was going fast.  
 
NH: No radar guns back then.  
 
WRS: No, no, there was nothing at that time. This was 1949. I remember when I got to the place 
where I was gonna make the turn, I started to make the turn. I could feel the truck tilting, but I 
couldn’t straighten it out. The only way I could straighten it out was to go straight. I couldn’t go 
straight. So I kept on going, going, going, until finally, WHAM! [claps hands] It went on its left 
side. It went sliding almost down to where it started going under the bridge. It blew the top of 
the trailer off completely. It blew all the watermelons off. Me, I was hanging onto the steering 
wheel, and the door opened. Well, you know, sliding on the side on the highway, it couldn’t open 
too much. But if I had gone out through that door, you know, I would have been made sausage. I 
don’t think I would have fit through there, but  anyway. But I hung onto the steering wheel. The 
steering wheel cracked all over, but luckily, in the old steering wheels, they had iron inside of 
them. So finally I came to a stop, I untangled myself from the seat and everything else I can, and 
the windows were open because we had no refrigeration or nothing at that time. And my 
passenger window was open, so I crawled through there. And I thought the truck was gonna 
blow up, see, because you could smell the burning and my fuel tanks were almost full. And I 
went way up in front of the truck out there on the side of the highway, and then after a while, 
here comes the highway patrolman. Took him a lot longer to get there than I did, see. And he 
looked in the truck, I still remember, he had a long flashlight. And there was nobody there, so he 
started looking around, saw me standing there, so he came to me. And he says, “you’re the 
driver?” So I told him, “Yes.” So I started [filling him in] and told him, “I’m okay.” And then, 
anyway, he took me to breakfast so he could write his report as we were having breakfast. And 
then he says, “You know, I was feeding you, because you could have been in shock, you could 
have had a hole that big,” he says, putting his hands up. “You could have had a hole that big and 
you wouldn’t have known it,” he says. He later became a captain of the highway patrol. He was a 
rookie then, huh? I still remember his name, Ameril Ruth. He’s probably way, way long retired, 
see, you know?  
 
[54:46] 
 
But anyway, and another time, when I had my plane. One time, it was much later than the 
produce deal, here. I had my plane in Phoenix. I had to go to the annual inspection and all that. It 
takes several days, two, three days, or whatever it took. So I went down there. And then I had to 
go down to Mexico real fast for whatever reason on my growing deal. So I got in my car and took 
off. We were about five hundred miles south at nighttime, it had been raining and whatnot. 
Everything was dirty, you know, the trucks were dirty. There was a truck parked on the 
highway. The narrow highway. When I curved. And I wasn’t going fast, I was going about 58-59 
miles an hour, not quite 60. And when I saw it, I was too close to it. If I had gone under the truck, 
I probably would have decapitated myself. So I tried to go around the side and then turn back on 
again, but I clipped the edge of his trailer, and it sent my car sideways. And with the roads being

wet and whatnot, I went sliding, and I rolled three times and fell in a ditch about ten feet deep. 
And I could smell burning. That brought my PTSD, that brought it to life. Because when we were 
shot down and my plane was burning and stuff like that, I could smell that in the plane, see, you 
know? And they were still shooting while the plane was burning. And that thing, for a while, I 
thought that’s where I was at. A guy from up on top of the truck that was stalled up on top there, 
came down and pulled and pulled on the door. He opened it, he saw me in there, he probably 
thought I was dead. So he slammed the door again and took off. Because I couldn’t open the 
door. I had kicked and kicked and I couldn’t open it. And so finally, I figured if he opened the 
door, I could open it myself. So I kicked it again a couple of times, and then it did open. I guess he 
had helped with his opening. And I got the heck out of there. And the Mexican police got me and 
threw me in jail. [laughs] Yeah, because the trucker gave the highway patrolmen-federal police, 
they call them down there-they gave him a bribe so that instead of blaming him for what he had 
done, parking with no lights on the highway on just a narrow road, two way, one going, one 
coming, they blamed me for going too fast and reckless driving and whatnot, see. But I got me a 
lawyer, cause I had some friends in the closest town there, which was Los Mochis, and got me a 
lawyer. And after about three days, they got me out of there. But in that jail, the jail was funny. 
They call it a tank where they hold all the drunks there. Well next to that was another room with 
nothing in it, just a completely empty room full of tile. Just tile floors, tile up to halfway the wall. 
And that’s where they put me. Colder than heck in there, because there’s no place to sit, no 
nothing. And I sat there all night long. By the time my friend…I forget…when I was going in, I 
saw somebody real fast and I told them to get me a lawyer, and that’s when my lawyer came in. 
They got me there, and he got the jailer to…I wasn’t hurt, I had scratches, but he got the jailer to 
allow me to be taken to the hospital to take care of me for my injuries. I didn’t have any injuries. 
So, you know, it’s all a matter of bite. So I was at the…and I told the doctor, don’t let me out of 
here until my lawyer says. In other words, you know I don’t have anything real bad. So he kept 
me there. And the lawyer came over, and he finally convinced someone to let me go to the hotel, 
the Holiday Inn [slight pause] on house arrest in my room. But I had a policeman outside my 
door. Until finally I got to the, oh, like a federal judge, judicial federal police, that’s what they call 
them down there. On a Saturday, he does work on Saturdays, you know? And he came into my 
room, no, he had come to my room before, and I told him the story. I told him, “that guy is lying,” 
I told him. “There were no lights behind the truck, I was not speeding, so and so and so.” And 
then he says, there’s a saying in Spanish that says this judge told me,” the highway patrolman 
speaks with hair on his tongue.” Like he was lying, see. So anyway, he knew how the system 
worked down there, that they take bribes and this and that. So on the Saturday, those guys work 
on Saturday, but they called me to his office on a Saturday, and he was there. His girl secretary 
was there, and she typed a big ol’ injunction paper or something there that had all the details. 
And that told him the whole thing again, and put everything on there. And then he signed the 
bottom, and he signed the sides, and I had to sign the parts…I signed the bottom, and signed on 
the sides. And then finally, they charged me 10,000 pesos. The rate of exchange that time was 12 
to 1, so that was $800. And I had to pay that to get out of there.  
 
[1:00:36] 
 
NH: Wow.  
 
WRS: So I got out of there, and I was free, but I never drove in Mexico again. From there, I took a 
taxi, went over to the house of my friend who got the lawyer and so and so. We had lunch and 
this and that, then either he or I took a taxi to the airport in Obregón, which is about, oh, eighty 
or ninety miles away, something like that, and caught a plane to Tucson. That’s the last time I 
drove down there. I’ve been to Mexico since, but that’s the last time that I drove down there. 
After that, I’d go on the plane. The plane was safe. But to go on the highways, nah.

NH: You’ve had a lot of interesting close calls and things like that. 
 
[1:01:53] 
 
WRS: In Germany, one time, we were on a mission, our plane was, every time you went on a 
mission, you came back with a bunch of holes in your planes. On account of flight. If not the 
bullets from the fighter planes, and there were a lot of fighter planes, and too few of us, see, you 
know? That’s when we were just building our air strength in England, and the Germans had all 
their full preparation. They’d been preparing for ten years, see, you know? They had 
Messerschmitts, they had Focke-Wulfs, they had, you name it, they had a whole bunch of planes. 
But the Messerschmitts were the ones that were more in volume, and [slight pause] anyway, we 
went on this mission, bombed submarine installations, but we were hit. One of our engines was 
hit with a 20 millimeter, and started burning. And it was over Germany, see, you know? So we 
took off for sea, bombed the whole thing. The whole group bombed. And then we took off, but 
with three engines left, we couldn’t keep up with the formation, so the formation left us. That 
was the rule. If you couldn’t keep up, you were on your own. That was the law of the thing. So 
before too long, we were by ourselves, and we were lost. And our plane was burning. And our 
navigator went haywire. He couldn’t give a [inaudible] course. And I was the radio man, and we 
were close to North Germany and North Holland, and the Germans were all there with their 
fighter planes and all that. So we did not want to break radio silence, because they could pick it 
up and come on out and finish us up. We were by ourselves then, see? So the pilot asked me to 
get a course to England, anyway, so I got the course, and we took off. The pilot corrected the 
plane and everything was Morse Code. I still remember Morse Code from that. So anyway, we 
made it back to England, losing altitude because another engine, it was turning and everything 
like that, but it wasn’t putting out the power. I don’t know, maybe it was hit also but I never did 
find out. We’re losing altitude from 25,000, we’re losing altitude, losing, losing, losing. When we 
were at 2,000 feet, the pilot gave us a choice of bailing out or sticking with the plane. Hell, the 
water down there was cold, you couldn’t stay alive too long in that cold water. So we were 
sticking with the plane. He said, okay, get everything that you can, all the weight that you can, 
throw it out. We threw everything out that we could. Everything lose, the machine guns in the 
windows, the guys threw them overboard. I didn’t throw anything out because I was on my 
radio all the time. All my extra radio equipment, I told them take this, take that, throw it out. 
They were even....we had thousands of, oh, I say thousands, I don’t know how many, of empty 
shells. They were heavy, those shells are heavy, those fifty calibers! They threw out I don’t know 
how many of those, too. And we kept ‘em going more and more and more, all the time I was

sending SOS’s. England knew where we were at all the time. We were going from here to here, 
see. And every so often, I’d send them an SOS, so if we went down, they knew where we were at. 
And they’d send a plane, [inaudible] drop whatever and save us. And so finally, finally, finally we 
came to land. We saw land, we came to land. When we came over the beach, there was a beach, 
there was some trees. Some of those trees I guess grow in salt water, I guess, whatever.  We 
skimmed the trees. That’s all the altitude we had left. So we had to go down. There was no trying 
to make the base or whatnot. And we went out there and [claps hands] splashed. One tire was 
completely burned off, and it gutted all the inside of that nacelle. All that engine was completely 
burned out. You can’t tell too much from the picture that the plane was on fire, but you can tell 
the props that are bent, and one prop was straight. That was from that one engine that wasn’t 
turning at all, see, you know? So that was a deal. We came out okay. We came out okay out there. 
Just scrapes and whatnot. I got some souvenirs from out there, see, you know? So and so on in 
my eye, also. We were, all we wanted to do was, before our mission, we went on [slight pause] 
it’s on the tip of my tongue…a briefing. We went on a briefing. And after the mission, we came to 
interrogation. On our mission, if you saw one of our planes go down, one of your duties was to 
see if any parachutes came out, and how many came out. The guys that didn’t come out, that 
means they were dead. If you saw, each plane had ten. If you saw three parachutes came out, it 
means three guys survived of that plane. If you saw more or whatever, or you didn’t see any, 
they all went down with the plane. Like, in our plane, one, two, three, four, five…five guys were 
shot in our plane, out of ten. And six died. But the sixth one is the one who saved my life, because 
I was on the floor, I was just about unconscious when he threw me out the door. I say just 
about…I don’t know anything, I don’t remember anything, but I had to have had some sort of 
consciousness, because there was nobody to open my parachute once they threw me out.  
 
[1:08:19] 
 
NH 
I was just wondering that. 
 
WRS 
That’s why I say, even though I don’t remember or what not, I had to have had some 
sense of consciousness in me to have pulled that cord. I don’t know when I pulled it, I don’t 
know how far down I went or whatnot, but when I hit the ground, I was totally out. When they 
picked me up, this happened at about 9, 9:15 in the morning, and I woke up at around 3 o’clock 
in the afternoon. And a lot of it was lack of oxygen. Because when that blast…when the plane 
started exploding, it knocked me up against one of the walls of the plane and broke this 
shoulder, still hurts sometimes, broke the shoulder, broke my nose, and other scrapes and 
whatnot, this and that. And so I got up real fast, got back up to a machine gun, not realizing I 
didn’t have my goggles, I didn’t have my throat mic for communication, which was okay, but I 
didn’t have my oxygen mask. I was just not thinking, I just got up and kept shooting, because 
there were too many planes. And before too long, I was on the floor. I was dying from lack of 
oxygen. And this guy, the voluntary gunner, that’s why he was walking loose and unprotected, 
when the plane first started getting in trouble, he got out on the [inaudible], which was what he 
was supposed to do. So he was loose with portable oxygen, then. So when he saw me on the 
floor, I guess I wasn’t down to the floor, touching my head to the floor, but I was sitting down on 
my knees or whatever it was, and he gave me, the last I remember was him giving me his hand 
to pull me. And I don’t remember anything else from that. So when they say you have nine lives, 
I don’t know, I think I’ve pretty well used all that up. But one thing I do know, and I don’t care 
who says differently, there’s somebody up on top out there that looks after us. Somebody looks 
after us. Somebody was looking after me. [longer pause] So anyway, we started with the trucks, 
and…[laughs]

No, that’s, it all comes together. So it’s good to have that, I think your son had told me 
that he had mentioned that you had been in Stalag XVII, so it was interesting, that personal 
experience. It seems like it made your impact on what you did later, after the war. And that all is 
good. I’m interested, definitely, in seeing the photos you have, just to… 
 
WRS 
You know, in my life, I’ve never been a follower. I never worked for anyone except the 
little jobs I had when I came out of school, at the mine, and I worked for the airplane factory that 
used to be where the old airport used to be, on the old Nogales highway. And from there, I 
jumped into the trucks. But I’ve never worked for anyone. I was always on my own. Luckily I had 
enough sense to put money in there for social security, because when you work there on your 
own, you get a dollar, that’s what you use. Whether you spend it or you save it or whatever, but 
you don’t think about withholdings. But when I got a bookkeeper to take care of my paperwork, 
I started saving for that, which is a good thing now. But the trucks, like I said. There were no 
trucks. Nobody told me that. College? No one in my family went to college. Why I went to college, 
what drove me to go to college? I don’t know. It’s just something in me that pushed me. What 
made me go back to high school? I didn’t go to high school in Nogales because I couldn’t. The 
kids that I was going to go back into tenth grade with were all innocent little kids. To me, they 
were babies. What I’ve been through and the whole thing out there, I couldn’t go, so I took off for 
Los Angeles. Nobody knew me, I didn’t know anyone, and I went out there and I talked to a high 
school counselor. What I wanted, what I needed, what hours I needed to go school, because I had 
to work and that, and I remember that lady. She set me up real good. And I did the same thing in 
college. It wasn’t like the university, where you go to one class on Monday, one class on 
Wednesday, one class on Thursday. I had solid classes. No study classes, no football, they didn’t 
have any sports like that there. No nothing except solid classes. Requireds and electives. And I 
took them both. When I graduated, I graduated with ten credits more than I needed, actually. 
And I wasn’t counting by credits, I was just going through my school, working, school, working. 
I’d go to school generally from seven in the morning, and I’d get out at one. Then I’d go to work, 
depends, started working at two. Depends on different jobs I had. And I’d come out at nighttime. 
I’d do my homework, and then sleep. Sometimes I wouldn’t sleep that much. But you know, a lot 
of guys, especially you’ll read about it in the paper today, they have PTSD coming back, when 
they come back. Me, one thing that saved me a lot, that helped me a lot, was the fact that I was 
going to school, working, doing the homework, and then sleeping what I could, and so and so, 
that I never had time to think about what happened back there. So PTSD didn’t bother me until I 
turned over in Mexico, out there in that car. That’s when it started bothering me. That’s when I 
started having bad dreams and whatnot. It woke up everything that I had been hiding. Now, I’m 
good now. I don’t have any dreams or whatnot. I still had certain dreams, not like the ones 
before where I was being shot, where I was being knifed. The knives, I think, come from the 
bayonets, the German bayonets and whatnot. They always had their bayonets ready to use. But 
one dream that I have nowadays every so often is, and I don’t know why, I mean, it’s not 
something…I’ll tell you what it is. I dream that I go with a group overseas. And we stay in a great 
big hotel. And then they tell us, okay, pack, because we’re going back. And everybody would 
pack and be gone. And me, I couldn’t get through with my packing. And when I went down, 
everybody was gone. I couldn’t get back home. That’s a kind of a dream, I still have those. I guess 
it relates in some way or another to the fact that I couldn’t come back home because I was in a 
prison camp. But I have that dream every so often. Everybody goes, and I can’t get away. When I 
go outside and we’re all supposed to be gathering or whatever, everybody’s gone. Everybody’s 
already gone. And I’m left behind out there. But the other ones are worse. But those, I won’t tell 
you those.

Thinking here. Is there anything, I know you were telling me a lot about the 
transportation and stuff, which is really helpful, I mean, I haven’t talked to anybody about that. 
So, I talked to Axl Holm a little bit about it, but it was more about his dad’s experience. Is there 
anything about you working down in the produce deal that…say I’m talking to somebody from, 
like, Sheboygan, Wisconsin, or somewhere in Georgia, like people who don’t know anything 
about Nogales, don’t know anything about the produce deal. Is there anything that you think 
people should know that we haven’t talked about?  
 
WRS  
Well, what I used to do, and I was successful. My success was in the fact that I was telling 
the truth. If they wanted a straight load of tomatoes and they wanted all number one, number 
two, or number three color, whichever they wanted, that’s what they would get. Now if I had, 
say, four or five pallets that had a little more color than that, I’d pick up the phone and I’d tell 
them. I’d tell them, “I have your load, but some of them have a little more color. Will you take 
them?” “Yes, but put those tomatoes in the tail end, or put them in the middle” on account of 
their deliveries out there. I always tell them what I can. I had a customer in Vancouver that used 
to buy from me all the time, and then one year he wouldn’t buy from me. He wouldn’t buy a 
package from me. And he was my friend, because I had been to Vancouver several times, I’d had 
lunch with him a lot of times. And boy, could he order that Chinese. He was a Chinese fellow. And 
he could order that Chinese food out there, delicious. I don’t know what he ordered, but it was 
good. But anyway, one year, he wouldn’t buy, he wouldn’t buy, he wouldn’t buy from me. And 
then he’d tell me, Walter, you wait. Anyway, when the deal ended, he filed for bankruptcy. He 
didn’t pay a lot of stuff that he bought that year. He filed for bankruptcy. He probably wanted to 
call it quits and wanted to quit with some money. So he did me a favor. If he had bought from 
me, he didn’t want to leave me flat out there owing money. So that’s why he didn’t buy from me, 
see? I called him later on and say “Hi, so-and-so-and-so, how you been, okay? And by the way, 
thanks a lot!” I thanked him for not buying from me, see. So there’s a lot of things like that. One 
place that I would never sell, I sold them one time, was Montreal. The Frenchmen in Montreal, 
they’re all a bunch of crooks. You have a lot of ties with Canada, but anyway. Every time you’d 
send them a load, they’d say the load came in bad, it was too overripe or too this and that or 
whatnot. I’d know it from the other guys. And one time one guy, I sold him some squash. I sent 
him oh, I don’t know, half a dozen pallets of squash. And I told him, I forget what his name was. I 
told him, “I gotta be paid within twenty days.” That was our rule out there, even though we 
weren’t always paid that fast. But twenty days, and the fruit you’re getting is number one 
quality. I don’t want any comebacks and this and that, whatnot. And sure enough, they were 
slow in paying me. And then one guy comes back and says, “the squash was soft, and the ants” 
and this and whatnot. So I called my friend, he was my friend, and I told him “Remember what I 
told you?” Listen to this here: one of them that was buying from me was a company by the name 
of Henri…with an “I” at the end, H-e-n-r-i.  
 
NH 
Like Henri.  
 
WRS 
Yeah. Anyway, I still remember that name. So I told him, “Look, I sold you so much 
squash. The squash doesn’t belong to me. It belongs to my farmers. I sell it for them. And if 
something goes wrong with it, I have to account for that. I sold you good squash in good faith, 
you promised me no problems, so please either have those guys send me a full check or else you 
send me a check.” So those guys sent me a full check, those other guys. He probably talked to 
them, said this guy, see, he knew my stuff was good.  
 
[1:20:32] 
 
NH 
That’s a lot of…

WRS 
So I never sold to them again anymore. And he wanted to me to sell. “Come on Walter,” 
so and so and so. “Come out here, I’ll get you to join the association out here” and this and that 
and whatnot. I told him, no, I can’t. You know, there’s too many problems out there. If it were my 
stuff and I wanted to gamble, I’m only selling it for them, even though I had money in those fields 
down there. But no, so you have to be careful where you sell. The guys that sell, that want to be 
in the market’s ten dollars and something, some guy wants to get eleven or twelve dollars 
because he’s getting a little short, he’s going to pay for that later on. Later on, when stuff gets 
along, they’re going to tell him “keep your stuff, I’ll buy from the guy who protected me.” So 
there’s a lot of things in selling that you have…my son, Harry…I don’t know, you’ve met Harry?  
 
NH 
[negative noise] 
 
WRS 
He’s very knowledgeable in produce. He knows quality. Of course, all of us had to know 
quality then. And he knows the sales part of it. What to expect for the future, see, you know? And 
if you can raise prices but it’s not smart to raise your prices, don’t do it. If you think you should 
lower it because there’s a whole stack of it coming up and everybody’s got a lot of stuff, get rid of 
it. Don’t hold it out there, because in the long run, you pay for it. So there’s a lot of things in 
selling. I don’t have to tell those guys. I’ve been out of it so long now that they know everything, 
and I know nothing now, actually. But one thing, you have to be honest.  
 
NH 
Seems like it’s a small enough community where if you’re not honest, everybody will 
know very quickly.  
 
WRS 
Your buyers will know that. And when it gets tough, you’re on their hit lists, you know? 
[slight pause] So anyway, but the truck part of it was very interesting. [slight pause] I used to 
load for the first guy that grew. Now, you tell that to guys in Nogales, and they’ll tell you it’s not 
true, “we grew it first, we grew it first.” But I was down there in the fields. I saw who grew pink 
tomatoes first. And that was [Fred Tribelay]. And he shipped to Childs Brothers. I saw him. And 
there were…oh, I forgot to tell you something else. There were pink tomatoes, [pole] tomatoes, 
we call them. There were pole tomatoes grown first in Baja California, before they brought them 
down to this area. And I used to haul tomatoes in Baja to Los Angeles for two farmers. They’re 
both dead, of course. That was a long time ago, no? That was in the ‘50s. ’53, ’54, ’55. I used to 
haul them [slight pause] from in Spanish, [Cologna Carrero], and from some other place, I forget, 
in the middle of the peninsula. The peninsula has something like an elbow.  
 
NH 
Right. 
 
WRS 
Right about where the elbow’s at out there. They used to haul pink tomatoes into Los 
Angeles. And from there, a fellow by the name of [longer pause] shit, I remember his first 
nickname, but what his last name? Not Joe, Granados. I saw him when he was teaching. Oh, a 
company that I can remember the name, the first load…Tricar. You’ve heard of it, probably, 
Nogales? I used to haul tomatoes for the father, for the doctor, [inaudible]. And then his son, 
Danny, he’s a very good friend of mine, took over. And now his son’s run the business. When 
Danny was still in school, agricultural school, no, he became an agronomist. But he was still in 
school, his father was a grower. They were just pinching pennies out there. Everybody was 
broke, see, you know? This Granados was down there, and he was teaching him how to plant 
pink tomatoes. Put the seed, and how to put the stakes, how to put the wire and whatnot, and 
the string, and so and so. They taught him the whole shebang. That’s when they started growing 
pink tomatoes. And then after that was when they opened up their distributing in Nogales there. 
They were in Nogales, not Rio Rico or whatnot where the rest of them are at, they were in 
Nogales. [slight pause] At Tricar. [slight pause] George Gotsas used to be at Nogales too. But 
George has done good. His father was a real nice fella. [Don Nico], Nick Gotsas. [longer pause]

Yeah, George has, almost everybody I’ve talked to says that you have to talk to George 
Gotsas. So he’s…trying to get something set up really soon, because like I said, he was on… 
 
WRS 
Well he’s very knowledgeable, he’s been in there since the beginning.  
 
NH 
Yeah, it’s been…that’s the nice thing is, I’ve learned, I’ve talked to people that are young, 
and have only been in it five years, I’ve talked to people who’ve been in it twenty, thirty, forty, 
you know, for a long time. I was going to ask you one thing just to clarify: when did you retire 
from working in produce, like how long ago? You talked about when you started, but I don’t 
think we ended up mentioning when you ended.  
 
WRS 
I was about 73, 74, something like that age.  
 
NH 
What year was, do you remember what year it was?  
 
WRS 
Deduct from now, and deduct, let’s see, [longer pause], I have an office in there, I love to 
work in it. We’re 2015 minus [longer pause], my math isn’t working right on that. Oh, let’s see, 
well anyway, say I was 73, I’m 92 now. Well, 91. Almost 92. So say 92 minus 73… [clicking of

NH 
Nineteen years.  
 
WRS 
So nineteen years ago would be nineteen, uh… 
 
NH 
’97? ’96?  
 
WRS 
No, it can’t be nineteen years? Well let’s see… 
 
NH 
You retired nineteen years ago?  
 
WRS 
Well, yeah, say 73. Somewhere very close to that.  
 
NH 
That would be about the mid-1990s.  
 
WRS 
No, when I quit? No, wait a minute, wait a minute, I’m confused with this. [clicking of

NH 
That’s okay.  
 
WRS 
It was in the eighties when I quit.

Okay, 1980s.

But I forget when. I don’t know. I think about mid-‘80s, something like that.

No, that’s fine! It’s just interesting, because I know I said you were talking about when 
you started, but I was trying to get an idea of when you finished.

WRS 
But I was in there, I know the faces of it for quite a while on. That’s all I ever did my 
adult life. Between the trucks and the…if I had to go back into one of them, I would go back into 
the trucks. I liked the trucks. If I had to…of course, there’s no way in hell now that I’d be going 
into any of those things here, but the trucking was very interesting. It kept us going twelve 
months out of the year. In summertime we’d repair our equipment, but we’d haul little stuff 
from California to Phoenix or California to Tucson. I remember when I was still on my own, 
before we started the big company, one summer I worked all summer long between [Blythe] and 
Los Angeles. Five days a week I would make a trip from Blythe to Los Angeles. Every day. I’d go 
every day. And the little truck didn’t have any refrigeration, nothing like that. And I would be 
taking what they called gunny sack cantaloupe. Gunny sack cantaloupe is just as good eating, it’s 
just as good, but when they packed the number one stuff, then they had what, should we say the 
next, they would repack what’s left. And they’d get all the better ones of the second one, and 
that’s gunny sack. They’re still good. And I’d take one load to the market in Los Angeles one day, 
and the following day I’d take one to a fruit stand in Santa Ana. And the next day, I’d go back to 
the market, and the next day to Santa Ana. Every day, five days a week, I would do that. And once 
in a while, once in a while I’d have to go on a Saturday. But I don’t think I did over two or three 
Saturdays. But five days a week, I’d go. I was tired, I was tired out there.  
 
[1:31:51] 
 
NH 
That’s a lot of work! 
 
WRS 
That’s a lot of work. I worked a lot, but it was rewarding. I went through, suffered 
through a lot of bad things, too. One time I had a full crop ready to go, and it froze on me. And I 
had a heck of time getting back on again. Two times that happened to me. And another time, 
we’re about two weeks away from…no, no. We were shipping. But the market went down. The 
big markets, are, say the northeast and north, or whatever. And it was very cold up there. They 
had a real cold winter. And I think people were buying hot chocolate and that instead of buying 
tomatoes. No salads, nothing like that. And the market went down. So we were waiting for the 
market to pick up, pick up. And so, it was costing us money, because you know, when a tomato 
gets ripe, you pick it off the plant. You can’t leave it on the plant there. You take it off and throw 
it away. That’s what we were doing, throwing them away, and waiting for the new crop, and the 
new crop would be coming up right behind. But the market never picked up, so we took a 
beating that year.  
 
NH 
I was thinking about it all weekend with Hurricane Patricia, because they were saying it 
was going to be 200 miles per hour. 
 
WRS 
[imitates wind] Well that’ll wipe everything out, now.  
 
NH 
It’s funny, I’ve been doing enough interviews that where my first thought, besides the 
people obviously, was like, the guys in Nogales are going to have a time if this hits Sinaloa or 
Nayarit or one of those places. It was funny, though, to be thinking about that. I could tell I had 
been doing interviews for a couple months, talking to guys about the weather.  
 
WRS 
You know, when they have weather like that there, and it hits the growing area, it 
doesn’t just flatten out the whole thing. It pulls your plants out of the ground, when you get wind 
like that there. And less than 200, see. Storms that they’ve had down below out there, they pick 
them up out the ground there. The roots and all.

I don’t doubt that. So it’s weird, it’s probably like a hurricane with a bunch of food and 
debris being… 
 
WRS 
It really, no, luckily it hit way down south, it hit between Vallarta, ever been to Vallarta?  
 
NH 
Yeah, I’ve actually only been to Mexico once, and I just walked across the border in 
Nogalaes.  
 
WRS 
Well, that’s not real Mexico, that’s not real Mexico.  
 
NH 
Yeah, I’m going to try to arrange a trip to go with some guys with one of the companies, 
to see if I can go down with them. Just because I don’t have the transportation means to get 
down there myself. We have one, mostly working car. So I have to…I’m going to get down there, 
though, at some point. I’ve got to.  
 
WRS 
It’s…Mexico is very interesting. It has a lot of things. There’s a place down there in a 
state, in a city the same name, Guanajuato. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of it or not.  
 
NH 
I think so.  
 
[1:34:58] 
 
WRS 
Way down there.  
 
NH 
Guanajuato?  
 
WRS 
Guanajuato. With a G, you know?  
 
NH 
Yeah, it sounds familiar.  
 
WRS 
And they have an old church out there that’s all gold inside, all. So much of it that to me, 
it didn’t look good. Number one, church shouldn’t be rich like that. Number two, it was 
exaggerated, the way it was. And then, you go, there’s another place in the same city that you go 
underground, and they have all those mummies. Mummified people out there, see, you know? 
There’s a whole stack of them out there.  
 
NH 
I’ll have to look that up. I’ve never heard of that place. I mean, I’ve heard of the city, but, 
you know, that sounds good. Is there any last thing here, before I…anything else about what we 
were talking about earlier, before I sort of wind this down here?  
 
WRS 
Trucks, trucks? Oh, well, I used to haul out of Baja to Los Angeles, out of Blythe to Los 
Angeles also, out of Culiacán, Los Mochis, I even had a little growing deal out in [inaudible-
Wymo?]. But the trucking part of it, we used to ford the rivers, I used to cut my own pieces of 
road with my axe, my shovels, my pick. See, what people would do, they would cut a lot of the, 
what they would call “palo blanco”. White sticks, I guess they called them. They used them for 
their tomatoes. And that’s where sometimes their road would go through there. See, the road 
was all full of mud, so and so. And they’d make a new path through there. And the cars could get 
by, but when they cut those poles, they’d leave so much from the ground sticking up, and they’re 
sharp. So I know a lot of times, not a lot of times, but a lot of sticks, I had to dig them out and 
make room so my truck tires would fit through there without going through there, see. And it 
was rough. And there were some spots that cars would go over and I couldn’t make it, it was too 
slippery for my truck. So I’d have to make my own path to the side out there, then. And the rivers

and then, when you went through, in Culiacán itself, you could cross a river on the railroad 
tracks. And then out in the fields, the roads were terrible, terrible, terrible. Because they were 
just building them with a lot of rocks to be able to hold it together. And you would just go over 
just as slow as, just to keep on moving, to get through. Especially when you reloaded. You could 
blow your tires off like that. Now, it’s paved and all that, see?  
 
NH 
Right.  
 
WRS 
But I hauled tomatoes, I hauled shrimp, and later on hauled everything else that they 
had out there. Bell peppers and squash, and you name it, everything that comes across. And the 
line here is all different now. It’s all modernized. They have a compound across the line. At that 
time, there was nothing like that there. I used to, like I say, park close to the line. I’d take a 
sample or two, depending upon what it was, I’d take it over to the customs broker, they’d check 
it, and I’d put it back in the truck. Then they’d give me the papers, I’d cross, come to the 
American compound, I’d open the truck so the American inspectors could inspect it, and then I’d 
have to go through [taps the table] the state inspector for motor vehicles. And he used to give me 
a rough time, all the time. And I don’t blame him, because one time he gave me a rough time and 
I told him to go you-know-what himself. [laughs] And that was a mistake. Every time I went by, 
he’d hold me there for an hour, and this and that, your papers, and so and so. Until one day I 
went up there, fellow’s name was Richardson. He was a strict guy. And I went up there and I 
said, “Mr. Richardson, I come out here with a peace plan.” I told him that, see, you know? I told 
him, “I know I did wrong, when I lost my temper,” and so and so, “And I know you give me a 
rough time. I want to be able to do this normally.” I told him that, no? And I told him, “I want to 
shake your hands as a friend, not as a driver and you as an inspector.” And we became friends. 
Every Christmas I gave him a bottle of scotch or a bottle of something, and after that little talk 
that I gave him, he never bothered me again. He never bothered me. So it paid to make the peace 
with him, because that guy used to be rough on me. And every single time. I couldn’t get by 
without going by where he was at. One time, when our trailers were…the compound on the 
American side, you could only park, I think, four trailers at a time. That’s when things started to 
get a little more, more trailers. You know how they park, I don’t’ know how many they park out 
there. Four trailers. And they used to be at a slant. And we used to unhook our trailers and go get 
another trailer. And one time, the trailer lost its brakes, and rolled down, crossed the street, hit 
the international fence, knocked the fence down, and half the trailer was on the Arizona side, 
and half the trailer was in Mexico.  
 
NH 
[laughs] 
 
WRS 
Loaded! It didn’t turn over, but the nosed was down, see, you know? So we had to go 
through customs, through customs brokers, and everything else like that. Take American jacks 
and what not to jack the truck up, hook a trailer, and cross it again, see, you know? And then we 
had to pay, we hired a guy to go put the fence up again. [laughs] That’s a long time ago. And then 
they built another compound next to it that would hold, I don’t know how many, sixteen trailers, 
or whatever. And then they went up the hill, where they’re at today out there. And they’ve been 
expanding as time goes by, see?  
 
NH 
That’s what a lot of people had said, that it was a godsend that they made it so big, the 
new one. The Mariposa crossing. 
 
WRS 
Mariposa crossing, right, yeah. I read in the paper yesterday where they made a tunnel 
for people to walk through. I haven’t been up on that hill out there for years.

NH 
I’ve never been to that specific place yet, because I haven’t…when I’ve been to Mexico, I 
just walked through the Morley pass, you know, right downtown.  
 
WRS 
So aside from that, I can’t think of anything else. Just plain and simple and cruel and raw 
and [laughs] whatever else. But it was hard. It was difficult. But as long as I was making a profit, 
I didn’t care. I was willing to work. In the long run, it paid. But a lot of hours in there. A lot of nail 
holes in my hand when we used to handle single package, and when they nailed them, some of 
the nails used to go through the sides, see, you know?  
 
NH 
Ow. 
 
WRS 
And hell, I still have some scars where, I used to get ‘em. There’s one right there. See it 
there? We’d pick up a box and there had been a nail, and we moved a lot of stuff. Of course, we 
used to have to handle them by single boxes, not pallets. A lot of guys quit at 5 o’clock now, see? 
It’s only the offices quit early generally now. It’s only the loaders, they’re late because they have 
to wait for a truck that’s coming in late or whatever. But a lot of places close early. Hell, for us, if 
you got off at 10 o’clock at nighttime, you were lucky! You were lucky, saying, what should we 
do, we’ve got time now, see? But a lot of times, midnight, 1, 2, 3 o’clock in the morning, [unclear] 
Anyway, aside from that, any questions you might ask?  
 
NH 
No, I think we’re good!
