Mr. Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music Library of Congress Washington, D. C.
My dear Mr. Spivacke:
We are forwarding you today the 16 records sent in by the joint expedition of Federal
Writers' and Music Projects in Florida. Professor Alton Morris, editor of the Southern
Folklore Quarterly joined the expedition at Tarpon Springs for Greek recordings, and
is supervising work at Sanford with a Slavic group. Reports on the recordings will be
forwarded as soon as the field notes can be written and edited,
I will await your comments on these songs with much interest.
Sincerely yours Carita Doggett Corse Carita Doggett Corse State Director Federal Writers'

REPORT ON FOLKLORE RECORDING IN FLORIDA TO AUGUST 30, 1939
The first sixteen records of the Florida folklore expedition are being forwarded to the
Library of Congress today. We believe that the technique used by the workers shows

improvement from record 1 which contains many repetitions to record 15 which was much
more carefully planned.
In selecting material, the expedition was guided by Mr. Halpert's recording made here
in June and the bulletins of the joint committee on Folk Arts. Especially helpful were the
suggestions of Professor Alton C. Morris who joined the expedition at Tarpon Springs.
Professor Morris used records of the Speech Department of the University of Florida but
will supply these to the Library of Congress if duplicates are available to him in Florida. We
hope this arrangement will be agreeable to the Library of Congress.
Due to the fact that Stetson Kennedy of the Florida Music Project will be released after 18
months continuous employment, further recordings will be made by Bob Cook, as operator
of the machine, and the folklore editor of the Federal Writers' Project, until such a time as
the Music Project can supply a worker whom they consider capable.
Plans have been made to record songs of the shrimp fleet at St. Augustine where many
Portugese are employed, and the songs of the negro shrimp pickers at the Fernandina
docks.
