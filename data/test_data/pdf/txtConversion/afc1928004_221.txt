TO THE PUBLIC. 
In presenting to the public this collection of our 
forts in Sony, Minstrelsy and Variety Sketches, we 
make no claim for poetic merit, in studied elegance or 
rhythm cy' our verses; but hope our egotism will be 
pardoned when we point to their reception with New 
York audiences, and their successive popularity where-
ever they have been heard, as evidences that they pos-
sess some title to the magnetism and naturalness which 
characterizes appeals to warm generous hearts rather 
than cool reasoning heads. 
If we have succeeded in beguiling our hearers into a 
forgetfulness of the anxieties,fatigues and gloom of the 
wordly warfare which beset all of us at times, the tem-
porary rays of sunshine which we have thus produced, 
repay us for all our efforts. 
To our associates in the profession, we extend the 
hand of fellowship, and desire to say that jealousy, of 
which we have occasional glimpses (happily they are 
rare and seldom accompanied by merit), is a 
stranger 
to us. 
To all professionals, we say— Work ; endeavor 
to elevate your calling; aid in bringing our Variety 
profession to the standpoint of par—Excellence. 
Your obedient servants, 
HARRIGAN & HART.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. 
Harrigan & Hart are perfectly irresistable, and for genuine 
talent have no superiors. 
In their " German Emigrants" they 
are good, in their " Higgenbottom Sisters," they are better, in 
their " Two Black Gentlemen" they are best. 
Both are pos-
sessed with excellent voices, they can dance splendidly, and it's 
encore after encore whenever they appear. — Chicago Times. 
Harrigan & Hart, this week, are on for two of their great acts, 
and as it is whispered that an Eastern manager has hunted them 
out as one of the strangest attractions of the day, and has se-
cured them for a 
season in New York, it will be readily per- • 
ceived that no time is to be lost in paying a 
visit to the West.
 • 
side Opera House.— Chicago Tribune. 
The McFarland-Richardson case has been dramatized in San 
Francisco, at the new Pacific Theatre. 
The death-bed mar-
rage is made the chief incideni, and is made intensely humorous 
by Horace Greeley giving away the bride. 
The leading comic 
role is that of Ned IIarrigan who plays and dresses Horace 
Greeley to the life.—San Franezeo Cal. 
The entertainment offered by Harrigan & Hart of th 3 
Thea-
tre Comique is irresistably funny. 
It delights the crowded 
audiences that nightly throng the house, and certainly the per-
son who could refrain from laughing at their excentricities and 
comicalities, would be grave indeed.—New York Herald. 
Messes Harrigan & Hart alone could give an entertainment 
superior to that of most of the troupes which visit us.—Ptovi• 
deuce Press. 
Among the most noticeable of features last evening, at the 
Theatre Cornique, was the screaming act of the " Mulligan 
Guards," by the original Harrigan & Hart. — New York Ilarcad.

DE WAITER GIRL. 
Humorous recitation by ED. HARDM AN. 
'T WAS nightime by der summer,

Five tousand miles von home.

By Krout's German band. 
'Twas den I

Von I

sweet voice crying out, 
Make Vily dare, give me room. 
I

Una dere behind dot barrel, 
Drawing beer for der deitcher near, 
Vas Louise der vaiter gal. 
Lilt a

MURPHY'S LITTLE BALK ROOM 
Original by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Air: Pat. Roach. 
DID you ever hear tell of Ted Murphy, 
He came from the County Mayo, 
lie kept a 
bar- room in this city, 
In a 
democratic ward here below. 
His distillery was over in Brooklyn, 
In a 
place that they call Irishtown, 
You'd get a 
bucket of ale for five cents, 
He'd trust whin you'd put money down. 
• (Repeat.) 
Success to my friend, Teddy Murphy, 
He often gave me two for one, 
I've played forty-fives at his table, 
Drank his whisky his beer an I 
rum. 
I've counted the cracks in the ceiling, 
Swept the sand off the flure wid a 
broom, 
I've raffled for many a 
turkey, 
In Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was laborers, canallers, and riggers, 
Who worked on the docks very hard, 
Shovelmen, pipernen, and dri vers, 
Who worked on the big Boulevard. 
On Saturday nights they assembled, 
Vviil a 
fiddler to play up a 
tune,

The Controlling Influence of Drink. 
10 
And they danced till the break in the morning, 
In Ted .)lurphy's little back room. 
There was a 
Dutchman kept over opposite, 
Who was jealous of Ted's rushing trade, 
He put up a 
job one fine evening, 
For the police to go make a 
raid 
On the liquors, barrels and glasses, 
In the bar-room wid their clubs they whit, 
And poor Teddy without provocation, 
To the Island for 10 days was sint. 
Poor Teddy he lost his influence, 
In the courts and the grand committee, 
lie sarved his full time in the prison, 
Praying each day to get free. 
He took spunk and jumped in the river, 
To swim to the Long Island shore, 
He got a 
cramp in his leg and his stomach, 
lie sank to rise up no more,

A 
Humorous Recitation by ED. HARTUGAN. 
IN a 
tenement brick, 
Where the families were thick. 
Lived McMullen, a 
poor little tailor, 
Although he was small 
At a 
party or a 
ball, 
He was nimble and light as a 
sailor. 
As a 
man, he was quiet, 
Kept out of a 
riot, 
Its nose was red as a 
pink, 
And when he got full, 
lie was like a 
mad bull, 
From the controlling influence of drink. 
Whin the war begun 
lie followed the drum, 
In the Sixty-ninth Regiment, a 
soldier, 
He went to the front 
The rebels to hunt, 
The devil a 
troop more bolder. 
When he marehe1 in the fight 
McMullen was tight, 
lie never took time to think— 
He was shot in the head 
And left thtA-e for dead, 
From the controlling influence of drink. 
McMullen had pluck, 
That's no use without luck, 
And whin they sent him to cook for the nagers. 
His spirit arose, 
He put his thumb to his nose 
Saying I'd see you in h-11 first, be jabot's. 
In ft cell he was put 
Twenty-two pounds to the link— 
Whin they let him go 
Oh! his health was so low 
From the controllitig influence of drink, 
12 
Whin McMullen got home 
He was all skin and bone. 
'Pon me sowl the poor little fellow was a 
failing. 
The doctor came in and says he 
Give him plenty of gin, 
For that's where the tailor is ailing. 
He swallowed a 
quart— 
His life was beginning to sink, 
More gin thin he cried, 
Rolled over and died 
From the controlling influence of drink.. 
Ohl the liquor and cake 
That rolled in at the wake, 
'Twould fill up a 
confectionary. 
The neighbors kim in 
To take the last look at him, 
Who'd a 
smile on his face like a 
fairy 
Wid sobs and wid sighs 
And tears in their eyes, 
They gave one another the wink, 
And slobbering, said 
I'm tould that he's dead, 
From the controlling influence of drink. 
There's a 
nate little spot 
Beyant in a 
Calvary lot, 
Where the poor little tailor was buried 
And carriages fine 
And sojers in line. 
In a 
boat cross the river was ferried. 
They stood round the grave, 
And many's the sigh they gave 
As the dirt was shoveled up to the brink. 
And on the tombstone 
Wa -
s. died alone 
From the controlling influence of drink.

To make sausages by steam.

Dem sausages begin to dance, 
And jump around der room. 
Now something vas der matter,

So Dunderbeck he crawled insite, 
To find dat out you know

Und went walking in her sleep, 
She gave dat crank one awful yank, 
Und Dunderbeck vas meat.

BIG RUBBER BUSTLE. 
Banjo Solo by En FI ARRIGAN. 
Sang by Saw DEVERE. 
I'LL sing of my girl, my lovely girl, 
She could play seven up and rounce, 
One fault she had, she had eyes like a 
shad, 
She couldn't set still but she'd bounce. 
I 
shall never forget the first time we met, 
With a 
wash-tub she was having a 
tussle. 
She fell on the ground and bounced out of town, 
The gal with the big rubber bustle. 
I 
searched far and near till I 
found out my dear. 
She was stuck on the end of a 
steeple, 
High in the air she was hung by the hair, 
Making snouts clown at the people. 
A 
rope I 
soon found fetch her to the ground, 
It used up a 
great deal of muscle, 
To the preacher we sped, I 
was bound tl wed, 
The gal wid the ingin rubber bustle. 
When we got to the place she was re3 in the face, 
The preacher ses now den I'll tie her, 
On her bustle she dropped, frough de skylight she 
popped 
Like a 
base ball d3 boys call a 
flyer. 
She lit on a 
cloud and went out of sight, 
To get into heaven she'll tussle, 
She made a 
mile at a 
jump, at every thump, 
She got on dat big rubber bustle.

BY-WORDS, 
17 
New by-words now are all the go, 
You'll hear them almost everywhere, 
Even the ladies pick them up 
And use them without fear. 
I'll see you when I've sold my dog, 
For you know how it is yourself; 
Just find out how the old thing work; 
'Then walk off on your ear. 
Let's go out and give the boys a 
treat, 
You'll hear the girls say on the street, 
So they give their trunks a 
holiday 
And start out for a 
time. 
They borrow some dry goods clerk's ear, 
Into a 
saloon him they steer. 
They pinch his leather, then they clear 
And still you wonder at crime? 
I 
recollect a 
circumstance, 
I 
took a 
girl down to a 
dance: 
Says I, my dear you want a 
drink, 
Say she " You be I 
do."

THE BARD OF ARMAGH. 
MI 
list to the lay of a 
poor Irish harper, 
And scorn not the strains of his ould withered hand, 
But remember his fingers they once moved sharper, 
As he sang to the praise of his dear native land ; 
It, is long since the Shamrock our dear Isle's lov' d 
emblem, 
Was pluek'd from the soil by the Saxon's wild paw, 
I 
was called by the colleens around me assembled, 
Their bold Phelim Brady the bard of Armagh, 
I 
was called by the colleens around me assembled, 
Their bold Phelim Brady the bard of Armagh. 
How I 
love to muse on the days of my boyhood, 
Tho' four score years have flown by since then, 
Oh sweet recollection how dear the reflection, 
The wildest of boys make the best of old men. 
At a 
fair or a 
wake I 
would twist my shillelah, 
And trip thro' a 
dance wid my brogues tied wid straw, 
I 
was called by the colleens around me assembled, 
Their own Phelim Brady the bard of Armagh, 
I 
was called by the colleens around me assembled, 
Their own Phehm Brady the Bard ot Armagh. 
In truth 1 
have wandered this wide world all over, 
Yet Ireland's my home and the land that I 
love, 
And when cruel death to his cold arms shall take me, 
And my soul shall have flown to the sweet realms above, 
Then oh let the turf that my old bones shall cover, 
Be that ot dear Erin, old Erin go bragh, 
By the side of my Kathleen, my good wife, God bless her, 
Lay your own Phelhat Brady the bard of Armagh, 
By the side of my Kathleen, my good wife, God bless her, 
Lay your own Phelim Brady the bard of Armagh.

The Silver Slipper. 
Song with Two Posture Dances, a 
Waltzing Chorus and Jig. 
Written by SAM'L N. INIacnEr.. 
Composed by HENRY TUCKER. 
The music of this song is published by Wu_max A POND & Co., 547 
Broadway, N. Y, Price 40 cents. 
THE moon was brightly shining, and a 
million little stars 
Sent down their rays upon her as I 
saw her through the bars ; 
A 
merry crowd had gathered there and dancing was the fea-
ture, 
But the fairest flower in •that boquet was that charming little 
creature ; 
She was dancing ' neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper. 
Oh, I 
can't forget the sweet and lovely pet, (Posture Dance.) 
The neatest ever seen, a 
perfect little queen, (Posture Dance.) 
For underneath the arbor I 
watched that lively clipper. 
And now my thoughts are centred on her little silver slipper. 
(Dance.) 
Her hair was all in ringlets. and a 
wreath of roses fair 
Breathed out the sweetest fragrance on the calm midsummer 
air ; 
A 
fascinating smile she had, her cheeks of ruby hue, 
And right above a 
Roman nose two eyes of violet blue ; 
She was dancing 'neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper. 
Oh, I 
can't forget, etc. 
I 
watched her all the evening, while my poor and wretched 
heart 
Was longing, vainly longing in that dance to take a 
part; 
The fates they were against me, for a 
fence stood just between 
Me and that laughing jolly crowd that between the bars were 
seen ; 
She was dancing ' neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper. 
Oh, I 
can't forget, etc.

BILL SIIIITHERS , 
Banjo solo by ED. HARRIGAN', sung by IIAnnY STAN-wooD. 
OLD Bill Smithers was a 
masher, 
lie lost his teeth from chewing gum, 
lie was head centre in a 
caravan circus, 
He manipulated the big base di um. 
He'd a 
pair of 1 
eet like a 
canal boat's rudder, 
His lip hung down like a 
policeman's jaw, 
He'd a 
set of teeth like an allig . tor. 
They'd cut through hash like an old rip saw, 
Big Dutch doughnuts with Havana wrappers, 
S;eep quiet boys with your window up, 
Assassinate a 
ten cent barber, 
Drink hair oil from a 
custard cup. 
Bill Smithers went across to Jersey, 
Lived on gravel and Newark cheese, 
He put his money in hi,; mother-in-law's pocket, 
He got out a 
patent for raising fleas, 
He spoke fifteen different kinds of language, 
lie could stick out his tongue like an elephant's tail. 
He could cross the ferry without a 
ticket, 
His boarding house was in a 
jail. 
Blow your finzers on cold mornings, 
Go and buy a 
pair of socks, 
Never wear a 
linen duster, 
Keep your beaver in a 
box. 
Bill never was known to play casino, 
He carried sand in a 
public school. 
He slid off a 
roof and fed in a 
sewer, 
Caught the eperzooty from a 
mule. 
He was eat by ies in the month ot Angus, 
Embalmed himself in a 
barrel of lard, 
Joined Buffalo Bill on the western prairie, 
And enlisted in the Mulligan Guard. 
Put suspenders on your trousers. 
Always sleep at the foot of thedoea, 
Pay your house rent ,-hen you move out, 
Make you sinkers out of lead.

DANCING ON THE LEVEL 
Originally sung by BRADLEY & W ILD. 
I 
WAS dancing on the levee, 
While the steamboat whistle blowed, 
The captain was a 
calling, 
For us Digs and all the crew. 
Of course we obey orders, 
And on the boat went, 
And down the Ohio river, 
What a 
lovely time we spent. 
cnonts, 
Indeed, indeed, I 
did, 
Indeed, indeed, I 
did, 
Indeed, indeed, I 
did, 
Double deed, 
Indeed, indeed, I 
did. 
Of all the figs in the land, 
Witat sails the Mississippi, 
You'll never find a 
happier fig than Joe. 
When we arrived in Tennessee, 
We throwed a 
gang plank out, 
And when we got the freight ashore, 
The mokes commen,:ed to shout. 
The captain told us get the banjo, 
And we all could sing, 
And when they play our favorite, 
We cut the pigeon wing.

THAT'S WHERE WE BOTH GRAB GROUND, 
By NED ilatunaAN, for Walters & Morton. 
WE'RE a 
loose and careless pair of nigs, 
We're honey from the comb, 
We twist our legs in reel or jig, 
And dislocate the bone. 
Our understanding are immense, 
Just listen to the sound, 
We've got a 
heap of common sense, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
CHORUS, 
So watch this cur:icue, [ Symr.] 
Oh ain't it fan for you, [ Symi,_] 
For with a 
bound we bounce around, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
The peculiar vibrations, 
That's just below the knee, 
Causes a 
sensation 
Which creates a-jility, 
It raises dust and makes a 
noise, 
And lays things loose around, 
Here's what knocks— electric shocks, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
So wa.t.,di tai; 
To our lady friends we did iitxad 
To say a 
word or t 
wo, 
If nolhing more than ,f.,ii.re7oir, 
Or gins how do you do. 
Bat we know they will excuse us, 
And won't giv. Ls a 
frown; 
For among thc, dears we have no fears, 
Of losing any ground. 
So watch this, Jr,c,.

WE went on a

'12 was a 
high toned colored affair, 
We had 1os of spruce beer and pie, 
All dimly barbers they were there. 
We danced in the quadrille to and fro, 
The waltz and mazourka to charm, 
Vlien she whispered you're my own dearest Joe, 
And she leaned like a 
zephyr on my arm. 
elI ORT3S. 
I 
never shall forget my Sue, 
Like a 
weasel, oh jolly, she's . dy, 
And its mighty high per coon, 
Of a 
Sunday afternoon, 
As we promenade, Sue and I. 
We arrived and landed from the boa', 
Ebenezer Thompson walked behind, 
He catched me by the swallow tail coat, 
I 
told him that he wasn't very kind. 
He pulled a 
razor to put my 
Jealousy was beaming in his eye, 
My Sue fell in the gutter in a 
fright, 
And the other nigger wenches began to cry, 
I 
never shall forget, ,t-e.

THAT'S TUE CHEESE. 
BANJO SOLO. 
• 
By E. D. GooDrsG. 
GOOD-EVENING white folks all, how d'ye do, 
I've concluded to make you a 
call, with de banjo, 
If I 
succeed in pleasing you, 
And I 
my best will try, 
I 
hope you'll say when I 
am through, 
That's the cheese. 
In the war between Prussia and France—ober dar, 
King William made Louis Nap. dance—also swear, 
They didn't fight about Sweitzer cheese, 
Nor yet was it lager beer, 
But they quarrelled about the Rhine, 
iVot the cheese. 
Now a 
liberty I 
will take, if you please. 
With the people way out at Salt Lake, they're de cheese, 
Brig took a 
new wife and dal caused a 
fuss, 
And Brig then tried to stop it, 
But they all pitched in and walloped poor Brig. 
Bully for them. 
Another verse, then I 
will quit—for to-night, 
And the colored folks next I 
will hit, aint I 
right? 
Some want a 
nig for President, 
And Fred Douglass is the man, 
But that is not the sent-i-ment, 
.Yot much, Mary Ann.

MY POOR HEART IS SAD WITH ITS 
DREAMING. 
As sung by the 13th Ward Glee Club. 
MY 
poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has passed all away. 
They say that young loves like the flowers, 
That needs tender care in its urn, 
But mine`it was snatched from the bowers 
And I 
never gained one in return. 
CHORUS. 
My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has passed all away. 
My sad heart recalls all the pleasure, 
Of thoughts that are all, all for thee, 
When dreaming of you, of its treasure, 
And you seemed to love none but me. 
Tho' we meet not as friends, yet I'll never, 
One kind word to thee give, 
For your cherished memory ever, 
Shall be my soulj oy while I 
live. 
My poor heart, &c.

FtsuEn, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
THE other fine May morning 
I

And that I

He said I

He said if I

To an undertakers I

And steal a

And swore Tom Collins told him so. 
He said I

If I'm arrested I'm insane, 
Vexations come so fast you know, 
He said enough to turn me brain, 
If I 
kill him they'll let me go, 
I've worn out a

Traveling round the city, oh!

They captured that Tom Collins, oh! 
He said I

I'll dis-cribe this back-biter to you, 
So him you'll shurely re-cog-nise, 
He's six foot two in his stocking feet, 
He's the first man who invented lies. 
And if you should like to take a

To Catherine market you can go, 
You'll find him hung to a

THE BUGABOO, 
As sung by J
ERRY I
SARRINGTON, 
MUSIC published by E. H. liaTa 
ing, 283 Bowery. 
COME all you tender-hearted, boys, wherever you may be, 
r 
And 
tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardships, my boys, that I 
went 
through,3 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys, on board of 
the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat 
The day when first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal ; 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never shall, 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches aml a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead, for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
r 
Repeat, 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plow the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of Richmond barracks so 
true,* 
.Arhen the gallant 84th fir< d 
a 
royal salute of bricks at the Cap-
tain of the Bugaboo. 
[*Repeat. 
We sailed three years when a 
storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark 
blue sky, 
So the second mate gave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—lie 
set fire to the Bugaboo. 
r 
Repeat. 
When the ;aptain found what he had done, he loud for help 
did shout, 
He called up through the chimney top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out: 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so hird through the middle of the turf, 
they could'nt save the Bugaboo. 
['Repeat. 
When fifteen thousand miles from land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so hard one night, that it could'ut burn 
anymore; 
So the captain he gave orders to 1)wer the boats and save the 
crew,* 
While a 
1,000 rods of turf and 50,000 men were smothered iii 
tha Buriboo.

GIRL WITH THE FLOWING HAIR. 
Original. HARRIGAN & HART. 
MY thoughts of a 
girl I 
can't conceal, 
I 
met the other day, 
She'd a 
dainty foot and a 
lovely heel
., 
With, oh, such a 
winning way; 
No duck in a 
pond was half so light, 
As she with her careless air, 
The veil she wore was scarlet bright, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! my heart pit-pat as she passed me t 
So beautiful and fair, 
She glanced at me with her soft blue eye, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
We met again, /was in a 
set 
At the colored waiter's ball, 
As I 
balc,nced across her eye I 
met, 
really thought I'd fall; 
The music stopped, I 
stepped aside 
To let her pass with care, 
To speak to her I 
really tried, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
! 
my heart, .kc. 
Oh what is the use of feeling sad, 
When there's lots of pretty girls, 
In this town yet to be had, 
With plenty of silks and curls, 
But she's the only one I 
love, 
I'd tell her if I 
dare, 
She's sweet to me as the turtle dove, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
Oh t 
my heart, 
51 
SHE'S ONLY SEVENTEEN. 
Original. HARRIGAN & HART. 
I'M in love I'd have you know, 
And the feeling's very queer, 
They call her darling little Flo, 
her voice I 
love to hear, 
it's sweeter than the blackbird, 
Singing from a 
tree, 
And only her, upon my word, 
I 
love to go and see. 
CHORL 
It seems just like a 
dream, 
When first I 
met my queen, 
She's this darkey's honey-comb, 
She's only seventeen. 
Oh the rainbow is : retty in the -ky, 
And a 
sun-shower very pretty too, 
Methinks I 
hear you all rep,y 
They are very handsome things to Tiew.„ 
But perhaps to see this girl you wou1:11

We crave your condescension, 
And we'll tell you what we know 
Of marching in the Mulligan Guards 
From the seventh ward below; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey— 
/,‘. Tipperary man— 
He carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
CHORUS. 
We shouldered guns 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the 
Connemarro pet, 
With the Rub, dab, dub, we marched in the mud--
To the military step 
With the green above the red boys,

To show where, wc came from; 
Our guns we'd Hit, 
With the right shoulder slat, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We should I'd, ,te. 
When we'd rt hour, at night, boys, 
The divil a

We'd all set up and drink a

Of Whisky, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As sjippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
And march Au the Mulligan Guard.

On the good boat Danger; 
A 
long, long trip on the Erie, boys, 
I

We'd heavy fogs, aaf wlnud storms, 
Forget 'em I 
never shall; 
I'M every ien a 
sailor boy, 
On the E-ri-a Canal. 
Cnonus. 
For the Erie is a 
rising, 
And the gin is getting low; 
I 
haidly think you'll get a 
dric.k, 
Till we go back to Buffalo. 
We were loaded clown with barley, 
When we bid good-bye; 
When a 
pirate Lc:-
.'e 
upon us, 
With an awful wicked eye. 
I 
saw him through the spy-glass, 
put up a 
flag of truce; 
I 
found it was the Three Sisters, 
Four days from Syracuse. 
For the Erie, le 
Three days' out we struck a 
rock, 
Of Lackawanna Coal; 
It gave the boat an awful shock. 
And stove in quite a 
hole. 
I 
halloed to the driver, 
On the tow-path's treaden dirt; 
Ile came aboard and stopped the leak, 
With his flannel undershirt. 
For the Erie, t'kc. 
In two years we reached the Hudson, 
We hadn't slept a 
wink; 
The crew mutinizecl 
Because I 
refused to drink. 
Keep up your courage, then I 
cried, 
bring you safely in ; 
And w en we strike a 
grocery store, 
We 11 swim in barrels of gin. 
For the Erie, &c., 
The storm went clown, we went ashore, 
Me and Sal and Hank; 
Greased ourselves with tallow-fat, 
And slid out on,a plank. 
Sal is in the Poor House, boys, 
The crew are all in jail; 
l'm the only sole surviving moke, 
Left to tell the tale. 
S?cREN 
So haul in your bow-line, 
Stand by your sorrel mule, 
tow bridge, boys, dodge your heads; 
Don't act just like a 
fool.

Written by NED HARRIGAN. 
11 STE had my share of trouble, 
While I've been here below; 
By being kind o' foolish, 
Since I 
began to grow. 
I 
throwed away my books, 
When I 
went to school; 
The teacher stood me on a 
desk 
For the boys to call me fool. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
ain't a

I 
ain't a

De teacher cut rry hand with his awful big ratan, 
But he ain't a 
gwine to do so no more 
I 
used to go 
fishing, 
Wid needlee, hooks and pin; 
Fish jerked me in de water, 
And den I 
couldn't swim. 
I 
floated like a 
sponge cake, 
I 
used in water soak; 
De doctor said they couldn't drow:t. 
Such an awful foolish 2unke.

Salt water ain't Irv, 
you don't believe it go and try. 
But f 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no more. 
Den I 
went and fell in love, 
I 
fell almighly hard; 
Wid a 
gal who had a 
temper, 
You could measure by the yard. 
She hit me wid a 
club, 
When I 
asked her for a 
kiss; 
She went and got her brother Bill, 
For to shoot at me and miss. 
CHORUS. 
But he ain't a 
gwine to do so no more, 
Ile aint a 
gwine to do so no more, 
tin gwitie to stay under the bed and cover up my head. 
lie ain't a 
gwine to do so no more. 
I 
wish I 
was an onion, 
'Bout a 
watermelon size, 
I'd git in (lit gal's family, 
To make her cry out her eyes. 
If I 
was a 
bull itog, 
Her brother Bill I'd bite; 
Den he'd go mad and eat his dad, 
Don't you think that's doing right. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
ain't a

I 
ain't a

For Hydrophobia's bad, there's no fun in getting mad,

In every place I 
ask for him, he's sure to be away, 
I'm quite distracted in my mind, I'll shoot the man on sight; 
lie haunts me in my very dreams, I've lost my appetite. 
They tells me he's in such a 
place, and when I 
go to see, 
They're sure to tell me that the man has gone to look for me.

Oh, where can I 
Tom Collins find, 
I

I'm quite distracted in my mind, 
While up and down I 
stray. 
"Tom Collins" has insulted me, and must apologize,' 
They say he talks about me in a 
manner I 
despise, 
The other day I 
met a 
friend and heard the worst of news; 
Ile told me, if I 
didn't mind, my lovely wife I'd lose! 
" 
Tom Collins" said that she had gone up on the morning

Along with quite a 
handsome chap, to see me ne'er again. 
Oh, where can, &c.

stray, 
I 
ask in each, if they have seen " Tom Collino" there to-day. 
In one place, for the twentieth time, I 
call'd, and was hick'd out. 
No satisfaction can I 
get: I'll catch him soon, no doubt. 
I've worn out twenty pairs of shoes, such is the chase I've led; 
Oh, wouldn't I 
be tickled now, to hear that he was dead.

THREE" years ago, this very day, we went to Governor's Isle, 
For to stand forninst the cannon, In true military style, 
Seventeen American dollars, each month we surely get. 
For to carry a 
gun and baganetts with a 
regimental step. 
We had our choice of going to the army or to jail; 
Or it's up the Hudson river with a " copper" take a 
sail! 
Oh we puckered up our courage, wid bravery we did go, 
Oh we cursed the day we went away wid the Regular Army 0

CHORUS.. 
There was Sergeant John AlcCaffery, 
And Captain Donahue, 
Oh they make us march and toe the mark. 
In gallant company " Q," 
Oh the drums would roll upon my soul, 
This is the style we'd go, 
Forty miles a 
day, on beans and hay, 
In the Regular Army O.

We came near being made bald-headed, but they never got out

We lay among the ditches, in the yellow dirty mud, 
And we never saw an onion, a 
turnip or a

Oh we were taken prisoners, conveyed forninst the Chafe, 
Oh he said we'll make an Irish stew, the dirty Indian thafe, 
On the telegraphic wire we walked to Mexico. 
We bless the day we skipped away from the Regular Army 0 
There was Sergeant, & c. 
We've been dry as army herrings, and as hungry as a 
Turk; 
Oh the boys along the street cry out, " Soger would you 
work ?" 
We'd ship into the Navy, for to plough the raging sea, 
But cold water sure we could'nt endure, ' would never agree 
wid me. 
We'll join the politicians, then we know we'll be well fed, 
Oh we'll sleep no more upon the ground, but in feather bed, 
And if a 
war it should break out, they call on us to go, 
We'll get Italian substitutes, for the Regular Army 0! 
There was Sergeant, &c. 
We've corns upon our heels, my boys, and bunions on our toes 
From lugging a 
gun in the red hot sun, puts freckles on our 
nose, 
England has its Grenadiers, France has its Zoozoos, 
The U. S. A. never changes they say: but continually wear 
the blues. 
When we are out upon parade, we must have our muskets 
bright, 
Or they'll slap us in the guard house, to pass away the night, 
And whin we want a 
furlough, to the Colonel we do go; 
Ile says— go to bed, and wait till you're dead, in the Regular 
Army 0!

A 
GOOD FELLOW. 
A humorous Recitation by ED, HARRIGAN. 
CIIEESE pards, I'll give it out straight, 
How I 
dropped down to a 
bum, 
Don't lay it altogether, rocks, 
On whisky, gin and rum. 
Put some of it to good nature, 
I 
was allus ripe and meller, 
I 
loved company, ' deed I 
did, 
They said I 
was a 
good feller, 
Have a 
ball, no mixey pards, 
I 
his't no more this year, 
Go in and get your load, 
But don't say I 
gave you a 
steer. 
I'm agin ' em shure, bet on me, 
On the avenue or in a 
cellar, 
I've drank enough to swim a 
ship, 
That's when I 
was a 
good fellow. 
You're young, fresh, full of chin, 
You've got to keep up your lick, 
There's a 
way to get out of it soon, 
There aint much need of a 
kick 
Stay home and study figures, 
It's an old thing for me to bellow, 
Studying-Hoyle was solid for me, 
That's when I 
was a 
good fellow. 
73 
Mother's sick, ah, that's tough. 
You say you're her only kid, 
Don't use the old woman rough, 
Might get a 
stepmother instead. 
If you aint flowing I'm lying. 
You start like a 
steam propeller, 
Boy, you'll do a 
heap of that crying, 
If you stick to being a 
good fellow, 
I've a 
few scads, aint on the borrow, 
I 
was broke, I 
struck the gang, 
They give me the old I'm sorry, 
That's charity done up in slang, 
They said that I 
was a 
good un, 
When a 
muss sprung up I'd quell her, 
.My head been as big as a 
pudden, 
It come from being a 
good fellow 
That's all the advice I'm giving, 
You take it, I 
don't want a 
sou, 
Save money, you'll get a 
living, 
Y'mus'nt mind what they say 'bout you. 
What, me? I'll get long, don't worry, 
I'm bran new like a 
silk umbrella, 
I 
walk by a 
ma/ in a 
hurry, 
I'm done being a

COLD winter passed away,

May your Herald never die, 
You kept me from hard work and toil, 
Upon the Boulevard. 
To work I'(1 never stoop, 
While I

Oh to break stones in a 
quarry, 
think it's awful hard. 
There's many an honest man, 
You've oft filled his dinner-can, 
You put sunshine in his family, 
At meal-times every day. 
Oh ! I'll be bewailing, itc. 
I 
remember well the station-house, 
Where I 
always slept, 
On the daffy down feathers. 
That were in the iron bed. 
The wharf down at the river, 
Where I'd crawl under out'v the wet, 
Neath longshoremen, fishermen 
And canallers gentle tread. 
I'm called a 
snoozer, 
By ev'ry ould bruiser, 
I'm as hungry as a

I 
could ate a 
bale of hay.

I'd rather lose my life, my boys, 
Than lose my honey-dew. 
Some call it Cavendish,

And they dale it out in plug, you know. 
When it is fresh and green, 
When from my work I

You vere stole away from me. 
If ye have studied history,

From the wild red Injin men,

When he met them face to face, 
But they all sit down continted, 
And they smoked the pipe of peac:14 
If ye'd only take a 
puff, 
Shure one would be enough 
To put you in a

A 
stupor, or a

Ye might say it's not ,ginteel, 
But so beautiful I 
feel 
Whin I 
sit down in the corner, boys, 
Wid my little ould Duddeen. 
My Duddeen, 
A Frenchman smokes the little thing 
They call the cigarette, 
It makes him feel uneasy, 
As he blows, and puffs., and frets. 
'The Chinese smokes the opium, 
'Till it puts him in a 
doze. 
And the Yankee smokes the bad cigar, 
W 
id one end to his nose. 
But every Irishman— 
Bould Patsey, Mike or Dan, 
That was born in dear old Ireland, 
Where the grasses grow so green, 
If they've no coat to their back, 
They've that bit of clay so black; 
It's a 
consolation to them, 
Is the little old Duddeen.

And she strikes a 
hard blow. 
Her cheeks they are rosey, 
And nate as the posey;: 
At the big Castle Garden 
She landed below.

Oh say, have you seen her, 
To you I'd describe her,— 
She rears a

She moves whin she's walking, 
She spakes whin she's talking; 
An' her petticoat is marked.

She comes out wid my cousins, 
count them by the dozens; 
I'm forced for to think 
They have led her astray. 
For some information 
I'd suffer starvation;

Swear oil against whiskey, 
Drink nothing but tayi 
On her cheek there's a 
dimple, 
On her nose there's a 
pimple: 
Her fut's very small— 
Sure she wears No. 10. 
She was the lady 
That fought Mrs. Brady, 
At home in Mayo 
She could whip all the men. 
She'd sing like a 
fairy, 
Or any canary, 
She never was standing 
Whinever she set. 
Like old Neptune's daughter, 
She'd fall in the water, 
She'd come out like a 
herring, 
She'd never get wet. 
She was sober when drinking, 
When aslape she was thinking 
She was delicate and soft 
As the wild buffalo. 
She'd a 
hand like a 
sailor 
On board of a 
whaler; 
her name is McSwegan, 
From the county Mayo.

And the birds were singing gay, 
While the flow'rs 
the air with odor sweet, 
Strolling leisurely along, 
Humming some old plaintive song, 
A charming little maiden I 
chanced to meet, 
She had eyes of bonny blue, 
And her cheekt a

Like a

Oh ! she looked divinely fair,

Oh! she looked so sweet and fair, 
With her neck and shoulders bare ; 
And my happy heart her image still embowers, 
I 
am like the littic bee. 
Kissing every flow'r I 
see, 
Since the day I 
met my love among the flowers. 
All enraptured I 
stood there, 
And I 
know it wasn't fair, 
Por the blush went from the rose into her cheek ; 
Turning round she seemed to smile, 
But with modesty the while, 
And respect and duty bade me then to speak, 
Pray excuse me, Miss, said I, 
But as I 
was passing by-
-Oh ! I 
found this plain gold ring, and thought ' twas yours 
Then she smiling, answered, no, 
Still she never bid me go, 
So we stood and talked awhile among the flowers. 
Pretty eyes,e.'-

Viewing first the setting sun, 
Then we saw the rising moon, 
Sitting side by side upon the portico, 
While upon her little hand— 
1 
had placed the golden band, 
And was waiting for her answer, yes,or no, 
Surely love was on the wing, 
Cupid there came wandering, 
And was seeking shelter from the dewy showers, 
When he saw each loving heart, 
Loathing evermore to part, 
Then he tied the knot of love among the flowers.

MY TRULY RURAL PRIZE, 
Written anl Composed by THOMAS M. 
HENGLEM 
IN a 
scene of rural splendor, 
Where the murmuring waters flow, 
Birds there sing together, 
Zephyrs whispering soft and low; 
There in a 
cot so cozy, 
A 
lovely flower cloth dwell; 
Spotless, fair as a 
lily, 
In love's dream there I 
fell. 
CHORUS. 
Her lips are like the roses, 
Kissed by the morning dew; [Svx.1 
She is my rustic beauty, 
To her I'll e'er be true. [Sym.3 
'Twas there I 
first beheld 
This lovely face and form, 
Which made me feel the dart, 
Of Cupid's magic charms; 
She sat within a 
bower, 
Where birds did harmonize, 
Perfumed by every flower, 
Was this truly rural 2rize. 
Her lips, &C. 
I'm as joyful as the birds, 
That warble in the trees, 
As they hop and iump an,' chirrup, 
And fly where'er they please, 
The happiest thing to me, 
Is to know I 
ruralize, 
With a 
charming little maiden, 
My truly rural prize. 
Her lips, &c.

am thine, forever thine. 
Now in this cot so lovely, 
You'll see my own sweet prize, 
A 
darling rosy posy, 
My truly rural prize, 
'Mid that scene of rural splendor, 
Where the murmuring waters chime, 
Loving hearts now beat together, 
With bird notes keeping time. 
And in that cot so cozy, 
You'll see my own sweet prize, 
A 
voluptuous blooming beauty, 
My truly rural prize. 
If ever you pass by, 
Step in, and her you'll see, 
With a 
budding little flower, 
A 
laughing on her knee. 
I 
bid you all adieu, 
It's time to see my Lize, 
I 
could not stay away 
From my truly rural prize.

MY LITTLE BUNCH OF ROSES, 
Words and Music by W. II. DELEIIANTY. 
I 
AM waiting here to meet my darling, 
And my heart is in a 
flutter of delight, 
For we kissed last night whim we were parting, 
And this is where she bid me come to-night. 
When away from her I 
am so lonely, 
I 
hnow not what to do, 
But her bright, sweet smile can ever cheer me, 
IIer heart is warm and true. 
Oh! 
When we kissed then I 
saw her pretty blushes, 
She turned her face away the blush to hide, 
I 
was happy with my bunch of roses, 
My little bunch of roses by my side. 
There is something that I 
must not tell, 
And that is where this maid does dwell; 
In her hair she wears a 
white camelia, 
And dark blue is the color of her eyes, 
And I 
call her my little bunch of roses, 
My darling, charming, captivating prize. 
It was in those happy days of childhood, 
When first I 
met this roguish little belle, 
fly a 
streamlet running through the wild wood, 
Though hut a 
boy, in love with her I 
fell. 
She is now the pride of all the city, 
Of summers, sweet sixteen, 
And is called by all a 
perfect beauty, 
A 
fawn-like, fairy queen. 
Oh!

ERIN FAR AWAY. 
Sung by EDDTE POWERS the Irish nightingale at Kerns & Powel;, 
Opera House, corner of Prince 3c, Crosby streets. 
He never sings 
this only when he wishes I 
o keep his audience all night. 
THE morn looked down from an azure sky, 
When the deadly fight was o'er, 
On the battle field were the brave laid low, 
Whom this life could claim no more, 
And its pale light cast on the damp cold earth 
Where a 
wounded soldier lay, 
O'er whose form crept the breath of death, 
As his life tide flowed away. 
In this verse he gets very much excited and falls against the bar. 
A 
comrade passing heard his moans, 
And soon the sufferer found, 
And gently raised his aching head, 
From off the crimsoned ground, 
Sweet words of hope and thoughts of home, 
Ile whispered in his ear, 
And spoke he of the victory, 
Which they had won so dear. 
This verse is great graft for the 
The dying soldier raised his 1: .
'ad, 
And gently brushed aside, 
The raven locks that his heart's blend, 
To crimson red had dyed, 
And faintly, slowly, comrade said, 
Not long on earth's my stay,

No more we'll roam in my childhood's home, 
In Erin far away. 
Is where he calls in Police (to drink.) 
But a 
lock of hair I 
pray you bear, 
To my mother o'er the sea, 
That when upon it she may look, 
She will kindly think of me. 
And tell her though mid India's sands, 
My mouldering dust may lay, 
My heart is still with Erin, 
Loved Erin far away. 
Here is where the gang shed tears ( for a 
ball.) 
Tell my sister though long years have passed, 
Since I 
saw her smiling face. 
That her form is present to my mind, 
Each feature I 
can trace, 
And at this my last, and dying hour, 
My wandering thoughts now stray, 
To the grassy glade where oft we played, 
In Erin far away. 
Eddie becomes weak and calls for assistance—Gus. 
Tell my brothers that I 
nobly fell, 
And as our father died, 
With my bayonet charging on the foe, 
And my sabre by my side, 
It nerved my heart to conquer, 
And the sepoy foe to slay. 
As visions bright crept o'er my sight, 
Of Erin far away. 
Eddie.— Ile is ettiJing lastly away. 
Tell the friends with whnt in childhood I 
played, 
Around the old oak tree, 
That my last breath blessed them dying, 
In a 
dim far o'er the sea, 
And tell them that I 
bled and fought, 
On this eventful day, 
For Britain's honor, Britain's Queen, 
And Erin far away. • 
His iudience discovered asleep in all directions round the floor. 
No more he said his eyes grew dim, 
Ere the next sun had shed 
Her glowing beams upon the earth, 
The vital spark had fled; 
A 
grave was made in which he was laid, 
Ere closed the waning day, 
Far from each haunt he loved so well, 
In Erin far away.

By Killarney's lakes and fells, 
Em' raid isles and winding bays, 
Mountain paths and woodland dells. 
Mern'ry- ever fondly strays. 
Bounteous nature loves all lands, 
Beauty wanders ev' ry where, 
Footprints leaves on many strands; 
But her home is surely there! 
Angels fold their wings, and rest 
In that Eden of the wes; 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Innisfallen's ruin' d

May suggest a 
passing sigh, 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by, 
Castle Lough and Glenna Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagle's Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Ange!s wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's sprirt

Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints. 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn Spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries daff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney, 
Music there for Echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a

Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstacy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud wreaths in that sky. 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine, 
Beauty's home. Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

JERSEY SAM, 
OH! I 
was born in Jersey, 
And of that I'm going to sing; 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wing. 
I 
went way down to New Orleans; 
And there I 
fought the foe, 
Along with Hickory Jackson, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am one of the olden time, 
And may be thought too gay, 
Ant I'm Jersey Sam, the Farmer's Marl, 
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! 
I 
bear the name of Samuel, 
Though some, they call me Sam, 
And through this world I 
rove along, 
As happy as I 
can; 
The world, they say, has been improved 
But I 
should like to know, 
If folks are any better now, 
Than Fifty Years ago, 
For I 
am one, &c.. 
When I 
was young, then boys were boys, 
And went to bed at ten; 
But now, when they are twelve years old, 
They think that they are men. 
You'll hear them call for rum and beer, 
And smoke cigars heigh-ho! 
What would our parents have thought of that 
Some Fifty Years ago ? 
For I 
am one, 
At midnight, too, one hears young men, 
With husky voices sing, 
That " Champagne Charlie" is their nani.:, 
And they know it's no such thing; 
They go to bed with a 
head- ache, 
At least they tell us so, 
I 
never heard of such a 
thing, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one, 
The women of the present time, 
They cannot draw a 
line, 
But wear our hats and jacketg, 
And appear quite masculine; 
They wear false hair, for it's the style, 
And call it their own; yon know— 
_ 
But our girls would scorn to wear a 
wig, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am Ot.c.

OLD BROWN'S DAUGHTER, 
TIIERE lives an ancient party, 
At the other end of town, 
lie keeps a 
little chandler's shop, 
Ills ancient name is Brown 
He's got an only daughter, 
Such a 
party I 
no'er saw, 
By jingo, I 
should like to be 
That old chap's son-in-law. 
Cuoaus. 
Old Brown's daughter's a 
proper sort of girl, 
Old Brown's (laughter's as fair as any pearl, 
1 
wish I 
was the Lord Mayor, a 
Marquis, or an Earl, 
I'm Wowed if I 
wouldn't marry old Brown's girl. 
Old Brown now he sells very nearly 
Everything you'd please, 
Treacle, soap, and bundles of wood, 
Lollypops and cheese; 
His daughter minds the shop, 
It's a 
treat to see her serve, 
I'd like to run away with her, 
But I 
haven't got the nerve. 
Old Brown's daughter, & e. 
Poor old Brown, he's very often, 
Troubled with the gout, 
lie " grumbles " in the little parlor 
When he can't get out; 
113 
Thou I 
go and make a 
purchase, 
0! and when she hands the change, 
That gal makes mepe/ga/-vanized, 
I 
feel so very strange. 
Ohl Brown's daughter, 
Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly, 
When I 
say a 
tender word, 
But old Brown says that she shall wed 
A Marquis or a 
Lord; 
But I 
don't think as ever 
One of them swells I 
shall be, 
But, by jingo ! next election 
I 
shall put up for M. P. 
SPOIZEN.—I 
shall then get in the House of Commons, which 
is only next door to the Lords. " Who'll vote for Scroggins ? 
Scroggins for Spitalfields ! 
Scroggins for ever! Scroggins the 
workingman's friend ! 
Down with taxes and up with Scrog-
gins! 
Scroggins votes for everything!" I 
think I'd stand a 
chance, anyhow I 
shouldn't he the only muff in the House—and 
then I 
should be the happy owner of— 
Old Brown's daug,liter, &c.

PAT O'BRIEN. 
PAT O'PdlIEN Li 
my name, Vu 
tell you, boys, from where 
came. 
Ould Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy, 
No country is so dear to me as the little isle stands near the 
sea, 
Where all the boys are blithe and free, deny it if you can. 
Ould Ireland is the place where they're famed for fun and mirth, 
Its equal can't be found if you search all o'er the earth: 
Good natured boys and girls are there, with none of them you 
can compare, • 
Where every heart is free from care, that makes an Irish boy. 
CHORUS, 
Pat O'Brien is my name I'll tell you boys, from where 1 
came, 
Ould Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy. 
Dan O'Connell, ould Ireland's friend, he struggled hard for to 
deLnd, 
'Gainst all invaders who did intend to claim poor Paddy's land ; 
Ile advocated Ireland's right with all his main and all his might, 
And he was poorly recompensed for all his toil and pains, 
In high courts of jlIstice he caused them all to stare: 
With his knowledge, wit, and humor, to hear him it was rare; 
lie always proved poor Paddy's friend when on his trial he did 
attend, 
lie caused the noblest back to bend to the honest Irishman. 
Pat O'Brien is my name, & c. 
In eighteen forty-four gone by, out countrymen they had to fly 
For, famine stared in every eye along ould Ireland's shore; 
They to America did sail, leaving their wi res and babies to wail; 
They were determined not to fail, but 
eir hardships to endure: 
The harp that once through Tara' s 
Halls, shall strike each cord 
again 
To welcome back those exiles from across the raging main. 
May peace and plenty ever be to our little Isle that stands near 
the sea! 
And all our toasts be: Ireland free 
and you'll he happy then.

Ain't it beautiful. 
But the worst of it

that's not military, is it, lads! 
It was a

WHEN THESE OLD CLOTHES WERE NEW 
EIGHT years ago, I 
looked a 
swell, sirs, 
With walking cane, and purse as long, 
I 
quizzed the ladies in the street, sirs, 
Alas, that game did not last long, 
I 
married got, to my migortune, 
From that day every penny flew, 
For soon I 
spent the marriage portion, 
en my wedding-day these clothes were 
We went to church, so blythe and merry, 
This hat of mine was new and light, 
We drank our crusted port and sherry, 
And ev'ry eye was beaming bright. 
But you, poor hat, can tell the hisCry 
Of where we go and what we do, 
But how you stand it is a 
myst'ry— 
Think of the days when you were new. 
And you, poor coat, have got quite seedy, 
I 
never cuffed you, speak the truth, 
You cannot say that I 
was greedy, 
I 
filled your pockets, yes, forsooth; 
For ey'ry morning you I 
studied. 
And after dinner open threw, 
And seldom were you skirts e'er muddied, 
I 
kept a 
trap when you were new. 
And you, poor boots, were bright as any, 
You really were a 
lovely pair, 
Cleaning you've cost many a 
penny, 
I 
took you with me ev'rywhere, 
But farewell to the soles departed— 
For my poor toes they do peep through— 
And you, poor tops, look quite faint-hearted, 
how different now, than you were new. 
And you poor gloves, my hands did shelter, 
Yet still I 
held you in my love, 
We through the world went helter skelter, 
Like true friends, living hand and glove. 
But farewell clothes, we part too soon. 
Then for a 
pauper's suit, grey or blue, 
I 
must die in a 
poor-law union, 
In clothes I 
hate, though perhaps quite new. 
MY 
old wife is a 
good old cratur, 
Never was a 
kinder born ; 
Never did nothing to make Inc hate her 
Since the wedding ring she's worn. 
Cuouus. 
And every morning for my breakfast, 
She gives Inc good toast and roll; 
My old wife's a 
good old cratur, 
My old wife's a 
good old soul. 
Then at night, when work is over, 
She brings my ' bacca and my beer; 
So, you see, I 
lives in clover, 
Ain't my wife a 
good old dear ? 
And every morning, & c. 
And when matters run three-corner'd 
She slides up so droll and kind; 
Gives me a 
buss, and gently whispers, 
"Did ' urn vex it ? 
Never mind." 
And every morning, & c. 
If, as now and then it happens, 
I 
get beery—even then 
She never says a 
cross word to me, 
But welcomes me with, " Well done, Ben !" 
And every morning, & c. 
Some folks live in better houses, 
Some folks live on daintier cheer; 
But none of them have got such spouses, 
Nor such ‘ bacca, nor such beer. 
And every morning, & c. 
Blest with health and my old cratur, 
From all feuds arid discord free, 
Pin quite convinced, throughout all nature, 
There ain't a 
happier chap than me. 
And every morning, & c.

BOLD IRISH PAT, 
Ain—Bloated Young Aristocrat. 
Written and Sung by the great Roactt, IrLh Comiqui% 
AN Irishman named Paddy Carey, 
Has come to sing for you to-night; 
I 
came from a 
town in Tipperary, 
Where we had many a 
light : 
But the girls and the boys there are witty, 
You can bet your last cent upon that, 
And in my own beautiful city, 
They call me Bowld Irish Pat.. 
Cuonus. 
Yes, you can see by the way that I 
talk, 
The shape of my stick and hat, 
Sober or tight, I'm in for a 
11- lit, 
Hurrah, boys, for BowId Irish Pat. 
The Saxon of late has been us troublin', 
That's the reason flint I 
came away, 
I 
paid my passage down to DubIln, 
And then I 
crossed over the sea; 
When I 
landed safe in this city, 
I 
was met by a 
chap they called Mat, 
Who welcomed me to this country, 
Saying, how are you, BowId Irish Pat. 
Yes, you can see by the way, ,Pc. 
But I 
like the ways of this country, 
Where a 
man can live by his toil, 
And if he is earnest and patient, 
He may soon own a 
bit of the soil; 
I've o'lerht a 
fine farm down in Jersey, 
And am eoing to live upon that, 
And if you want to come and see me, 
You'll be welcomed by Bowld Irish Pat. 
Yes, you can see by the way. Sic,

DRIFTING DOWN THE CREEK, 
Written for TONY PAsTon, by FnANI: DumoNT. 
ONCE again I 
claim attention, 
While 'I sing thcse several 
And a 
motto I 
will mention, 
One of course to suit the times. 
Sonic folks we're ever meeting, 
Through the world they go on cheek, 
Yet we know in spite of smiling, 
They are driftine down the creek. 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
They are drifting down the crt.ek. 
There's a 
frie:id who once had money, 
Now ' Us gone, lie wants a 
lift, 
Make his days of darkness sunny, 
Never let him go adrift ; 
Even Grant, the nation's ruler, 
Distant cousins he will seek, 
" 
Dents ' and presents he will never. 
Send them drifting down the creek. 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
lie will nev_r send them down the creek. 
Politicians too are needing, 
To keep open wide their eyes, 
The people's voice they'll soon be hearing, 
That will crush their plots and lies, 
Congress with its shares of railroad, 
Mobilier stocks as presents seek, 
Colfax, Ames and all those fellows, 
Send them drifting down the creek ; 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
Send them sailing down the creek. 
In conclusion I 
will mention, 
Should any powers ever strive, 
To tread upon this Yankee nation, 
tin! the " boys in blue" alive, 
With the mencry of our chieftain, 
George Washington of him I 
speak, 
Columbia rushes like a 
whirlwind, 
An I 
sends them driftin g down the creek. 
Down the creek, down the cre;:, 
Send them scattering down the creek.

McSWAI TAGAN'S PIC-NIC, 
Written for ToNv PASTOR by FRANK DUMONT 
OTT MeSwattaffan had been working hard, 
Climbing ladders with the hod ; 
But one hot day he thought he'd rest, 
So invited the friends, he liked the best. 
A pic-nic party he did start., 
Refreshments lie piled in a 
cart— 
He purchased whisky by the flask, 
And all the lads to drink did ask. 
Lots of fun they'd have no doubt, 
So 3IcSwattagan's pic-nic started out. 
Oh ! Miss Biddy O'Doyle had new red hair, 
Which she had curled with greatest care ; 
Mulcahy's father looked serene— 
For he wore a 
new cravat of green; 
MeSwattagan he was dressed to death, 
lie had perfumed his hair and breath ; 
He'd polished up his beaver hat 
By rubbing on it lard and fat; 
The ladies in their best did dress, 
And the pic-nic seemed a 
big success. 
Oh ! at length they reached the country air, 
For dancing they did soon prepare ; 
The fiddler he was full and blind, 
And his rosin and fiddle could'nt find, 
So MeSwattagan had to hum a 
tune, 
dance was started very soon; 
The bottles were emptied one by one, 
When Mulcahy's father spoilt the fun. 
He said he'd been insulted there, 
And for a 
ruction did prepare. 
Oh, Tim Boyle had said his cravat of green, 
A. trifle smaller might have been, 
Then Mulcahy's face got very red, 
And he hit Pat Flynn across the head ; 
Miss Doyle she lost her new red hair, 
McSwattagan he began to swear, 
McCarthy stepped upon his nose, 
And crushed the bunions on his toes, 
The fiddler was pulled out thro' his coat, 
And they jammed his fiddle down his throat. 
Bricks and stones began to fly, 
One hit lIcSwattagan in the eye, 
Policemen then did soon appear, 
And clubbed Mulcahy o'er the ear; 
Miss Doyle into the crowd she flew, 
And tore McSwattagan's shirt in two; 
The crowd fell fainting in a 
heap, 
They could'nt walk they could'ilt. creep, 
Policemen piled them in a 
cart, 
And the pic-nic party home did start. 
Cuoncs—(The next day ) 
'Twas the finest day they ever seen, 
A 
pleasant time it mi-ht have been; 
The,guest; did say with one accord, 
That McSwattagan's pic-nic was a 
fraud.

JOG ALONG) BOYS, 
THE BIRTHDAY OF WASHINGTON. 
Sung by LEW TIMMONS. 
'Tom me no dole-a-ful dirge you'll hear, 
To make you sad or leave you queer, 
But if you're dull this chant of mine, 
Will wake you up like sparkling wine. 
Ups and downs in life I've seen, 
Lucky and unlucky been, 
But wrong or riot, or right or wrong, 
This is the burthen of my song. 
CHORE'S. 
Jog along, jog along, jog along, boys. 
Jog along, boys with a 
rattle and a 
noise, 
Jog along, jog along, jog alpng, boys jog along, boys, 
_Hurrah. 
Its very strange, but every one, 
Gives me a 
name for noise and fun 
What every body Pays is true, 
I 
consort with a 
jovial crew. 
When the sun is sinking low, 
skelter, out we go, 
A 
jolty dinner is the thing, 
And as we pass the wine we sing, 
Jog along, jog along, Sc. 
Then to the music halls we post, 
And visit those we like the most, 
There in stalls our weeds we smoke, 
And shout encore to song and joke. 
Ballet pets are in our way, 
We throw the prettiest a 
bouquet, 
E u 
de vie, we gaily drain, 
And then why off we start again. 
Jog along, jog along, & c, 
The smal hours now are drawing nigh, 
And supper. supp,r, is the cry; 
Then bobster salads disappear, 
With oysters, stout and hger beer, 
Deviled chicken, kidneys too, 
A 
glorious bowl of puneh we brew, 
Clinking glasses gaily s;.und, 
While our merry chaunt goes round. 
Jog along, jog along, &c. 
WHEN the sun's golden rays woke the morn into birth, 
Crowning earth's fairest beauties with glory and mirth, 
Strains of music the rarest came floating along, 
And the voice of the nation joined in the glad song. 
[RepQat last line.] 
CHORUS.. 
Then awake sons of freedom, blend your voices in one, 
And join in the praise of our loved Washington. 
Oh gay broke the light and sweet breathed the monr, 
On that glorious day when our hero was born. 
Then the angels bade each broken heart cease to bleed, 
For God gave to our country a 
hero indeed. 
Then awake sons of freedom, & c. 
r 
ut that morning bath passed and his soul winged its flight, 
To the land of the blest in the regions of light, 
Yet the undying memories of that golden day, 
Play around the heart's altars and chant freedom's lay. 
Then awake sons of freedom, &c.

And doviAless sealed my fate; 
Her eyes like violets bathed in dew, 
Or diamonds rich and rare, 
And a

She's the fairest of the fair; 
Since we met I 
can't forget her charming ways, [sym.)

I'm captivated by her winning voice, 
Like zephyrs in the air,

She's the fairest of the fair. 
Oft did we wander in pale moonlight, 
'Neath the shady grove, 
And with her hand so lightly in mine, 
Breathe my heartfelt love; 
And she'd thank me for my esteem, 
But to wed she did not care, 
And then toss her tresses—inviting caresses, 
She's the fairest of the fair, 
\Viten next we meet low at her feet I'll tell may love argan .

WM only ten years old, I've heard ray mother

When I 
was quite a 
baby I'd such a 
taking way; 
When I 
was only twelve years old, a 
queer complaint 
I 
had, 
They called it kleptomania, and I 
had it very bad. 
The old folks tried their best this ere.complaint to cure, 
But no, 'twas all in vain, break out 'twas certain sure, 
But picking oakum -cured me: lor' I 
did.'nt feel the same, 
So I 
turned my pretty talents to a 
different sort of 
game. 
Chortm—I can do a 
little shuffle, &c. 
I 
can't stand those guns what does the prigging line, 
A 
man wat isn't honest, he's not a 
pal o' mine, 
For I 
once went on a 
visit to that crib at Holloway, 
I 
didn't like the treatment, so found it did'nt pay; 
So now I 
goes to races, I'm known at all the fairs; 
I 
does the country yokels, before they is awares, 
The fakement with the three cards brings the mopesses 
about, 
My coveys I 
find honesty the best of games what's out

The Old Home Ain't W hat it Used to Be. 
THE BELLE OF THE BALL . • 
By C. A. WHITE, 
011, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The banjo and the riddle has gone, 
And no more you hear the darkies singing, 
Among the sugar cane and corn; 
Great changes have come to the poor colored man, 
But this change makes him sad and folorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
CtioRus. 
No, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The change makes m sad and colon), 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
In the fields I've worked when I 
thou-ht twas hard, 
But night bro't its pleasure and rest, 
In the old house down by the river side, 
The place of all the world the best. 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
They are scattered now and o'er the world they loam, 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No, the old home, Sc. 
:.:ow the old man would rather lived and died 
In the home where his children were born, 
But when freedom cattle to the colored man, 
He left the cotton- field and corn. 
['his old man has lived out : as three score and ten, 
And he'll soon have to .ay down and die, 
"et he hopes to fro unto a 
better land, 
So now old mbin home, irood-bye.

HAPPY UNCLE JOHN, 
OH, good evening, white folks all, I 
come to make a 
call, 
And tell you how the old man gets on; 
I've come to see you all both short, fat, lean and tall, 
While there's dancing left in old Uncle John. 
I 
often have been told that this nigga's getting old, 
And soon will be going to the happy land, 
But while I'm on this sp ,-)t, and I 
the chance have got, 
I'll sing and dance a iong as I 
can stand, 
And that's what the ol

[Dance. 
When I 
was in my prime, I 
had many a 
happy time, 
With the folks way down upon the old plantation, 
And when our work was done, it's then we went in for fun, 
I 
tell you we was a 
happy population, 
My bones are getting sore, I 
cannot work much more, 
And soon to the happy land be gone, 
But while on earth I 
live, and I've a 
step to give, 
There will be dancing left in Old Uncle John, 
And that's what the old man wants to do.

HOW THAT POOR GAL SUFFERED FOR ME. 
Banjo Solo, as sung by LITTLE JENNIE BENSON, 
.64 
NOW 
listen to ine and a 
story I 
will tell 
Of a 
sad calamity ; 
It happened to a 
gal, her name was Sal, 
And dearly she loved me; 
She left her home on my account 
To cross the raging sea, 
And it almost bursts my heart in two, 
When I 
think how she suffered for me. 
I 
took her out one Sunday afternoon, 
Just for to have a 
lark; 
Says she, my love, the ball is up, 
We'll go to the Central Park. 
When we got on the ice she went to strike out. 
But the ice being slippery, 
Iler heels flew up, she came clown ker slap ! 
now that gal did suffer fo: me. 
For seven long years I 
courted her, 
With all my might and main, 
And I 
swore that none should separata me 
From my sweet Mary Jane! 
But it happened one dark and stormy night, 
To an oyst r 
saloon went she, 
Where she choked to death with a 
soft-shell crab, 
Which ended her suffering for me.

HAPPY LITTLE BOY. 
As sung by FEANK. KERNS. 
I'M a 
happy little boy, and dancing is my joy, 
I 
used to go to school, with Polly Ann, 
I'm a 
brother to the cure, and a 
hearty one I'm sure, 
I'm a 
fillibusted fig from Alabam. 
$o get up and get along, Pll s'ng to you my song, 
And give my heel and toe a 
twist about, oh T. 
You'll see before I'm done, that I 
am full of fun, 
I'm the happiest little darkie that is out. 
CHORUS. 
Get right back, get off the track, 
For I 
am bound to sing, and dance, and shout, oh, 
how funny I 
do feel, from my head, down to my heel, 
I'm the happiest little darkie that is out. 
I 
am dancing all the day, I 
feel so very gay, 
I'm a 
royal Bengal tiger you can bet, 
When I 
lift my feet up high, oh, don't it make them sigh, 
And my pigeon wing, oh, don't it make them get. 
With the girls I 
cut a 
swell, for I 
am called the belle. 
And when I 
flirt, oh, don't it make them pout, 
For I 
feel so mighty gay, I 
could throw myself away, 
I'm the happiest little darkie that is out. 
Get right back, &s.

MEET me Miss Mollie Malone, 
At the grove at the end of the vale. 
Be sure that you don't come alone, 
Bring a 
pot of your master's strong ale, 
With a 
nice piece of beef and some bread, 
Some pickles or cucumbers green, 
Or a 
nice little dainty pig's head, 
'Tie the loveliest tit-bit e'er seen. 
Then meet me Miss Mollie Malone, 
Then meet me Miss Mollie Malone. 
Pastry may do for the gay, 
Old maids may find comfort in tea, 
But there's something about ham and beef, 
That agrees a 
deal better with me. 
Remember my cupboard is bare, 
Then come if my dear life you prize, 
I'd have lived this last fortnight on air, 
But you sent me two nice mutton pies. 
Then meet me Miss Molly Malone, 
Then meet me Miss Mo.ly Malone.

Sang by JenaTNY Tnomrsoar. 
KIND friends I'm glad to see you a 
smiling all -around, 
I 
think I 
can amuse you for I 
feel so good and sound; 
Oh at dancing I'm perfection to the music of the fid„ 
And when day's work is done to have our fun 
This is what I 
did. 
-When I 
first came to the city, I 
was stylish to the feet, 
The ladies all they are so tall and dress so very neat, 
I 
went into an auction store and for these shoes did bid, 
And when the man asked me for the cash 
This is what I 
did. 
When I 
went to get married my girl was straight and tall, 
And master's clothes they fitted me like paper on the wall, 
The parson says to me young man which girl are you to wed, 
When I 
answer the old preacher man 
This is what I 
did.

FOGARTY MUSKETEERS, 
Originally sung by CONROY & DALY. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1374, by A. J. 
FISHER, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington. 
YOU'VE heard of the Mulligan Guards, 
And Captain Jinks so gay, 
But we're the Fogarty Musketeers, 
We're very proud to say, 
We charged each man five dollars a 
head, 
And how do you like our style? 
Our company is rather small— 
We fall in single file. 
CHORUS. 
We've been turning out for years, 
Give us three hearty welcome cheers, 
Stop the car, shout hurrah, 
For the Fogarty Musketeers. 
We had the Curbstone band, 
He played March on the Rhein, 
And the deadheads on the sidewalk, 
Did pivot to the time. 
We went up Werth street, and down Broadw:).,,,, 
And then through Manhattan Alley, 
Of course we stopped in Mulberry street, 
To get a 
wreath off Mrs. Zallie. 
We've been turning, &c. 
When we arrived at East New York, 
The band did play away, 
The nigger he commenced to kick, 
And squealed out for his pay. 
Of course that bursted the company up, 
And filled my eyes with tears, 
And I 
knew I'd never turn out again, 
With no Fogarty Musketeers. 
We've been turning, Scc.

HIGH TIMES, 
As sung by FRANK KERNS. 
THE Yanks have come, and gone, and went, 
And done it down in Dixie, 
A.nd old massa took the gals and run away, 
While they raised the very dickens, 
All around the disvicinity, 
And massa gave the figs holiday. 
CHORUS. 
High times, good times, down in Massa Chicken, 
The darkies gained but seven pound a 
day, 
Oh, phillimer, phillimer, bow, hurrah, 
I 
want to be a 
general, 
That's what the Yankee soldiers say. 
Like Daniel in the lion's den, 
I 
see them in the menagerie, 
Oh, the darkies they were compass all around, 
Until the bugle sounded, it was high low jack for Liberty, 
And the nigger wenches for frolic they were bound, 
High times, &c.

As Pang by JENNIE YEAltliE8. 
I 
WAS walking out one evening, 'twas in the month of June, 
A

She looked so loving, and so sweet, I 
vowed that soon or

I'd steal a 
kiss, from this young miss, when parting at the 
gate, 
CHORUS. 
'Twas on one pleasant summer's night, 
But never mind how late, 
I 
sweetly kissed a 
charming miss, 
When parting at the gate. 
We met quite often after that, till one fine summer nigtt, 
I 
told my love, she did the same, she trembled with delight, 
She promised to be always mine, I 
blessed my lucky fate, 
Of course I 
kissed, this darling miss, while parting at the 
gate. 
'Twas on one pleasant, 
Time has passed, and we have now our hearts together tied, 
Our lives are filled with happiness, the hours they sweetly 
glide, 
But I 
will neer forget that night, I 
vowed that soon or late, 
I'd sweetly kks a 
charming miss, while parting at the gate.

THE JOLLY DUTCHMAN, 
Written by OSCAR W ILLL1S for LUKE SCHOOLCILLYT, 
I 
AM a 
jolly Dutchman, 
From Yarmany I 
came, 
And if you wants to find mer 
out, 
Fritz Donderbeck's my name. 
The reason I 
came of tins place, 
Is to told you of a 
spree 
Vot happened to a 
fellow called Hans, 
And an another one—dots me. 
Hans and his gal was married, oh, 
I 
bet you five dollars dat was so, 
And all dem fellows from down below, 
Come right away quick to the spree, 
There was Gotleb and Mike, 
And Wigenstein and crazy Ike, 
There was big nose Jake, the fool, 
And Openheimer and me; 
Openheimer he got drunk, 
And come down on his head ker.plunk, 
Just as Gotleb got him on his knees, 
They both fell down in a 
plate of Dutch cheese, 
Hoop la, set 'em up again, 
Knock ' em down again. 
Set 'em up again, 
ponder vedder, set 'em up again, 
Drunken Dutchmen was we. 
/ 
tell you we had lots of fun, 
And plenty lager bier. 
Fritz Heuzenbaum, oh, he got mad, 
And tried to bite off my ear, 
I 
got so mad like everyding, 
Ond I 
grab him by the head, 
Ond I 
stab him with a 
pretzel 
'Till I 
thought he 'was gone dead; 
We kicked up a 
devil of a 
row just thee, 
Row just then, row just then, 
When in come four big policemen 
And wanted to take me. 
I 
said all right, 
We was only fooling because he was tight, 
When they say go ahead 
And give us a 
glass of beer, 
The policemen then, youst for spite, 
Eat so much switzer they all all got tight 
I 
tell you it was a 
hunky old night, 
And we didn't go home 
'Till they put out the light. 
Each mock,•nock, set 'em up again, 
Knock 'em down again, set 'em up again, 
Dunder blitzen, set ' em up again, 
Swy glass of bier for two. 
I 
danced with a 
gal 
At the ball that night; 
Her name was Katarine, 
The reason dat I 
like dat gae, 
Is because she likes benzine. 
She has a 
gum bile on her nose, 
And a 
bunion on her ear, 
And a 
moud so big, I 
take my oath, 
She can swallow a 
keg of beer. 
Oh, I 
tell you, she's a 
hanky gal, 
A 
hunky gal, a 
inlay gal, 
I 
tell you she's a 
hunky gal, 
And she's going to marry me. 
I 
invite you all to come and see my Katerhae. 
Don't stay, for we expect you all to see. 
Katerine can easy be found, 
For she only weigh three hundred pound. 
Oh, don't you wish dot you was me, 
To have uch a 
nice little girl like she. 
Oofety gufe, you know how ' tis myself, 
You know how ' tis myself, (repeat ) 
Oofety gufe, you know how tis myself, 
You know how the old thing works.

Her name was Selina .B,:11,_ata Crow, 
And I 
thought her so tender and mild; 
I 
called on her every day ye know, 
And followed her just like a 
child; 
I 
poured out my heart to Belinda Crow, 
Said for her to the end of the world I'd go; 
But she giggled at me and my love ye know, 
And it made nae so awfully wild. 
Cho. — I 
really felt dreadfully riled ye know. 
3 I 
bought her a 
beautiful duck one day, 
And a 
basket with eatables piled; 
She said, Tommy, come in the evening, 
And potatoes we'll have with it biled. 
I'll be out all the day, said Selina Crow, 
Come at ten o'clock, then 
be in you know; 
That's the night I 
received such a 
terrible blow, 
And it made me so awfully wild. 
Cho. —I 
really felt dre.,(1fully riled ye know. 
4 New trousers I 
wore that cest fourteen and six, 
Had my hair cut and beautifully ited; 
In the evening I 
called at her house about six, 
As the time I 
thought might be beguiled; 
I 
looked in at the winder and didn't I 
store, 
Miss Crow and a 
dapper young man were there; 
They were eating away at my duck I 
declare, 
Oh! it made me so awfully wild. 
Cho.—I 
really felt dreadfully riled ye know. 
5 I 
rushed on the pair like a 
lion ye know, 
And I'm sure I 
look'd awfully wild; 
Crying, oh! you deceitful, you false young Crow, 
But she turned up her nose and she smiled; 
Then the young man arose and to me did say, 
With his mouth full of duck for which I 
did pay ; 
That young lady's my w ife, we 
were 
married to day', 
Oh, it made me so awfully wild. 
Cho. — I 
really felt dreadfully riled ye know. 
6 
Said I, you're a 
swindler and cheat, Miss Crow, 
Said her husband, I 
say, draw it mild; 
Then he kicked me right into the street ye know, 
And it made me so awfully wild; 
I 
certainly thought they were very unkind, 
And I 
think that they might have enquired if I'd dined; 
I 
get mad even now when it crosses my mild, 
And it makes me so awfully wild. 
Cho. — I

The Old Man's Drunk Again.i 
YOU'VE no doubt heard the song, 
Of " Father dear, come home," 
And the fate of hungry little Ben, 
Who sent for him to come; 
[Tow the old man used to " smile," 
And cause the family pain, 
But he let up for a 
little while, 
And then got drunk: again. 
We've given him up for gone. 
He's lying in the lane, 
And almost every body knows, 
The old man's drunk again. 
He takes his morning nip, 
And loafs about the door; 
Ile told his family more than one; 
That he would drink no more; 
Dut then be would forget 
From " benzine" to abstain, 
The police, they would come and say, 
" 
The old man's drunk again." 
We've given him 
up for gone, &c. 
Ile'd smash poor mother' nose, 
And upset brother Ned, 
And drive us all into the street, 
Then tumble into bed; 
And when he'd be asleep, 
We'd go back and remain, 
Until he woke and left the house, 
To come home drunk again. 
We've given him up for gone, &c. 
" 
0! Father, dear, come home," 
Stop drinking like a 
sow; 
You've drank away the beds and stove, 
Don't swallow up the cow; 
0! don't abuse the boys, 
And cause poor mother pain, 
Or we'll rebel and " go tor you," 
When you get drunk again. 
We've given him up for gone, Ice.

They could drink all night and never get tight,

What matter was dat—you see I

For money we was scorning. 
Von night I

To tell de truth, I'm much afraid—I 
got drunk while I 
was derei 
And between Lager and Benzine, I 
was drunk as ever seen.

And she valtzed just like a

Yes, she lived on a 
farm and she milked de cows, 
And every mornin—she'd drive de town in, 
To sell milk from her ladder's dairy. 
One day when she sold de milk all out, 
I 
ask her to go mit me, 
I 
buy her Limberger, Lager Bier and Sour Krout, 
how it ended you shall see, 
We had a 
fight—she hit me in de snout, 
Yell what about 
Speaking. 
Because I

So den I 
got married and settled for life, 
And we lived so happy no words or strife, 
For about two weeks—when I 
saw her tricks, 
She wouldn't get up in de morning, 
I 
told her get up an, she hit me on de head, 
She hit me on le head while laying in le bed, 
I 
took her waterfall ana trow it gin de wall, 
Ann told her den Lake warm, 
She den went up to de policeman's place, 
And angry words did mutter, 
She saki I

And had me rested for salt and butter, 
Put me in a

She can go to

THAT'S THE WAY THE STORY GOES. 
40-IF 
1. There was a 
Young Woman her name was Fan,That's the way the 
  - 
 
yr--
sto - ry goes, 
She fell 
in love with a 
man named Dan, 
— 
411. -41  -  
 
I 
That's the way the 
sto - ry goes; Now Fan loved Dan, and-
Dan loved Fan, 
As true as 
wo-inan e'er loved a 
man, And) 
- 
Dan he kept a 
Chest-nut stam1,01i that's the way the st*
o-ry goes. 
2. 
"I'd like to get married," says Dan to Fan, 
That's the way the story goes, 
Say's Fan, " I 
quite approve of the plan,"._.. 
That's the way the story goes. 
Dan said, "go get your parents' consent," 
Fan said " she would," and away she went 
Looking so fair and innocent, 
That's the way the story goes. 
3. 
As ran was going down Nassau Street, 
That's the way the story goes; 
Another Young Man she chanced to meet, 
That's the way the story goes; 
175 
He looked so shy and winked his eye, 
To escape his glances Fan did try, 
'Twas all in vain, he gave her a 
Pie,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
4. 
The Pie, it gained the heart of Fan, 
That's the way the story goes ; 
The Rival of Dan was a 
Penny Pieman, 
That's the way the story goes. 
Fan gained her Father's and Mother's consent, 
To get married, and off with the Pieman went, 
But since that clay she's had cause to repent,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
5. 
For coming away from Church that day, 
That's the way the story goes; 
A German Band began to play, 
That's the way thc, story goes ; 
And frightened a 
horse in front of a 
car, 
Knocked down and killed the poor Pieman, 
And made a 
widow of faithless Fan,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
6. 
Now, broken-hearted, about the streets, 
That's the way the story goes; 
Faithless Fan her Dan oft meets, 
That's the way the story goes. 
He heeds her not, but passes her by; 
" 
All hot! Two a 
penny !" she hears him cry 
"And" she's sorry she ever took the pie,— 
That's the way the story goes.

Ea-, that we reeommand it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad habit of "flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any Zurther neces-
sity of explaining 'how, when and where to do it," and this little 
volume would advise and init late the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, coFting 
25 cents, called " The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the mod us oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all ebjec-
tmnahle in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitata to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers.

It is a 
Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called • HIPAIPTY DII3IPTY,' and bon n 
d 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedif 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appeav-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand•
