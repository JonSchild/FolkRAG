The Well Water (Young Henry [md] Love Henry)In Yorkshire lived a noble knight,Young Henry so
gallant and bold.His true heart was light and his armor brightWith a [helmet?] of silver and gold.
e/
His steed he did rein over mountain and plain,But, alas, he did ne'er come again,For he rode away
by a well, they say,To see little Lee, his love.With an eventide Young Henry she spied,Dashing up on
his milk white steed.To earth Henry sprang and his gold armor rang;With outstretched arms did she
plead."Come in, lie down, young Henry," she said."And stay all night with me,For there never was a
lord in Yorkshire landThat I loved as well as thee.""No. I can't tarry and I won't lie down,And stay all
night with thee,For there is a girl in Yorkshire landThat I love far better than thee."'Neath her mantle
fold, in her hand she did hold,Concealed there an old Spanish dart.Jealous and rash she struck like
a flash,And she stabbed him to the heart."What have you done, my pretty fair maid?What have you
done?" said he,"For don't you see my own heart's bloodComes trickling down to my knee?"Then he
tried to unbuckle his armor,And he fell on the cold, cold ground.Then her heart it did relent as o'er
him she bent,Trying vainly to staunch his wound."Oh, live, oh, live, young Henry," she cried,"One half
an hour for me,And all the doctors in Yorkshire landShall be at the cure of thee." 2 2 of 2The Well
Water (Young Henry [md] Love Henry)"No, I can't live one hour for you;Your jealousy has cost my
life.But I loved you better than any girl,And I soon [ would ave would've ?] made you my wife."Then
she called to her maid-in-waiting;"My secret I wish you to keep,And I'll make of you a lady then;On
a downy couch you shall sleep."Then one took him by the long yellow hair,And the other one by
the feet,And they carried him away to the well waterWhere it rains so cold and deep."Lie there, lie
there, young Henry," she said,"' Til Till the flesh rots off your bones,And that Fanny girl in Yorkshire
landLooks long for your coming home."
'Till
Then up spoke his pretty polly,Sitting on yon green willow tree,"There never was a girl in Yorkshire
landThat he loved as well as thee.""Oh, come to me pretty, / polly,And sit all on my knee,And your
cage shall be lined with a yellow beaten gold,And hung on the green willow tree."
P/
"No, I won't come and I can't come,And sit all on your knee,For you have murdered your own true
love,And you might murder me!" **"If I had my bow, arrow, ***My bow, arrow and a string,I would

send a dart through your proud heartSo you could no more sing.""If you had your bow, arrow,Your
bow, arrow and a string,I'd fly away to yonder yonders green,And tell what I had seen."With her heart
like a stone, she stood there alone,And she walked to the side of the well.Soon she fainted and fell
over sideways;And down she fell, fell, fell.
