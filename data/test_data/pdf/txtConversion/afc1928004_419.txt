THE FASCINATING WIDOW. 
COMIC SKETCH. 
BY SAUL SERTREW. 
CHARACTERS : 
MRS. BROWN, a 
Widow, 
M R. JONES, her admirer. 
[The character of Mrs. Brown is personated by a man in 
fenude attire, disguised to represent a 
very fleshy woman, his 
dress to be padded and stuffed to make him. look as large as 
possible, the bosom of the dress to be arranged so as to unbutton 
and take the things out and expose to view]. 
SCENE.—Plain room. 
Large arm chair with covered 
back R. 
Table and chair L. 
Empty gallon demijohn on 
table. 
Large paper window in flat L. 
Mrs. Brown discov-
ered at window. 
Comes forward fanning herself. 
Mrs. Brown.—Oh, dear, I 
feel so lonesome I 
don't know 
what to do. 
I've been looking at the people going by for 
the past hour. 
Some are hurrying along, some are chat-
ting gayly, and some with faces sad and gloomy as 'my 
own. 
Oh, how I 
miss my late lamented Brown. I 
never 
thought I 
would feel the loss of him so much. 
He fell 
overboard and was swallowed by a 
whale, and I've be-
wailed him ever since. 
Yes, lye tried to live in solitude 
and forget the thoughts of loving again or marrying with 
any man! But I've been thinking of late that I 
need a 
change of scene to cheer my lonely heart, or I'm afraid I 
will pine away to nothing. 
I'm falling away so fast and 
getting so thin I'm only a 
shadow to what I 
used to be. 
5 
My doctor says I 
must have a 
change of air. 
I 
must go 
out more and mingle in society, or otherwise I 
will go into 
decline and die. 
Yes, I 
must have a 
change, something to 
enliven my drooping spirits, and I've just received a 
press-
ing invitation from Jones, the butcher across the way. 
He wants to take me out a 
riding in his butcher cart. 
He 
says the country air will do me so much good, and such 
a 
handsome widow as I 
am should not be left alone to pine 
away when they are those who would give the world for 
one of my smiles. 
(
Playing with her fan). 
Now, the only 
encouragement that I 
ever gave Jones was, I 
believe, I 
winked at hini once, and then I 
had something in my eye, 
but it wasn't at him I 
assure you. 
Yet I 
must say that he 
has always been very attentive to me, and I've been think-
ing of late that—(sings song). 
"I'M WASTING AWAY." 
I 
really think I'll change my mind, 
Though once I 
made a 
vow, 
I'd ne'er again on any man, 
My heart and hand bestow, 
For some one now to love and tease 
I'm pining all the day. 
And think if I 
don't marry soon 
I'll wither all away! 
Cuonus. 
I'm wasting away, I'm getting so thin, 
To lose all my beauty I 
think it's a 
sin, 
I'll marry again, all sorrow disperse, 
Whoever will take me for better or worse! 
[THE FASCINATING W IDOW. — Continued,} 
To make your home a 
Paradise 
I'll do my best to please, 
And then to tend your grocery store 
I 
think I'm just the cheese, 
I'll cook and wash, and iron too, 
And make the nicest bread, 
So if you want a 
darling wife 
Now here's a 
chance for you. 
Chorus.—I'm wasting away, etc. 
Enter hurriedly, Mr. „ ones 
2d E. 
Mr. Jones. — And I'm just the man who will take you for 
better or for worse. 
(Goes to her). 
Mrs. Brown (startled).—Oh, mercy! how you frightened 
me. 
Why, Mi.. Jones I 
am astonished at you—this abrupt 
intrusion! 
Mr. JOI2CS (
pleading).-0h, forgive me. 
I 
beg your 
pardon most sincerely. 
I 
heard your sweet voice and 
your charming singing and I 
couldn't wait to be ushered 
in I 
was so impatient and anxious to behold your sweet 
face once more. 
Mrs. Brown (confused).-011, I 
must go and get my 
smelling salts or I 
shall faint. 
(Runs off R. 1st E. 
Takos 
the padding from the bosom and puts in a 
pair of boxing. 
gloves and one striped stocking). 
Mr. Jones (looking after her). — There she goes. 
I 
have 
frightened her away. 
She is so delicate, poor girl. 
The 
least little thing startles her. 
Yes, she was over in my 
store one clay, and she got frightened at a 
spider and 
slipped up and fell into a 
tub of butter, and when I 
res-
cued her from that perilous situation she threw on me a 
smile just as sweet as the cream of milk and I 
cheesed it 
and have loved none but her ever since. 
Yes, the first 
time I 
ever gazed on her diamond eyes she winked at me, 
and if there is anyone who knows how to throw a 
fascinat-
ing wink it is a widow, and I 
never shall forget (
sings 
song)— 
" 
SHE GAVE ME SUCH A WINK." 
Oh, the first time that I 
met her, 
She threw on me a 
glance 
That made me feel so happy 
My heart began to dance, 
I 
tried to speak, but what to say 
I 
really,couldn't think, 
She burst the buttons off my vest 
She gave me such a 
wink. 
CHORUS. 
Wink! Wink! Winking at me I 
She stole all my senses 
A winking st me. 
Wink! Wink! Winking at me 
My heart she has pilfered 
A 
winking at me. 
Oh, this fascinating Venus 
She's won my heart complete, 
Such darling little chubby hands, 
Such dainty little feet, 
Her fairy form to gaze upon 
Just takes away my breath, 
I 
want to kiss her right away 
And hug her most to death. 
Chorus.—Wink I 
Wink! Winking, etc. 
[THE FASCINATING WIDOW.—Continued.] 
Enter Mrs. Brown (skipping about). 
Mrs. Brown. — Oh, Montague! 
Montague! I 
can't find 
my smelling salts, and you've put me in such a 
flutter I 
shall surely faint. 
Mr. Jones. — My darling, Pauline, forgive me this time 
and I'll never do so again. 
(Puts his arm around her waist). 
[Aside. — Oh, what a 
fairy-like form to encircle! 
Mrs. Brown (toying with fan). [ Aside.—Oh, my 1 He's 
got his arm around my waist! 
Oh, ain't he awful! May 
be he thinks I'm going to faint and wants to support me]. 
Well, I'll forgive you this time, but don't never frighten 
me again, for I'm liable to faint. 
I'm so delicate the least 
little thing startles me. (
Starts suddenly). 
Oh, my ! what 
a 
strange feeling has come over me. 
(Puts hands to her 
head). 
I 
believe I'm going to faint. 
(Bows head on Jones 
and makes a 
feint to fall). 
Mr. Jones (alarmed).—Oh, heavings! 
She has fainted I 
(Struggles to hold her up and backs her up in the large arm-
chair and fans her with his coat tail or hat). 
Yes, she has 
fainted! (Grabs demijohn from table and holds it to her 
nose). 
These smelling salts may revive her! 
Oh, what a 
picture to behold! 
Beautiful immensity in all its magni-
tude! 
Her alabaster cheeks are as pale as a 
white-washed 
fence ! 
Her dishevelled hair hangs over her velvet tapestry 
shoulders like a 
door mat struck by lightning! 
Oh, what a 
subject for a 
chromo! Ah, she moves! She speaks 
She 
flops her ears 
No, ' tis but the echo of her snore! 
She 
moveth not! (Feels her hand). 
Ah, her hand is as cold as 
a 
frozen pan cake. 
Her eyes glisten like two oysters on a 
half shell, and hr lips are as blue as a 
mackarel. 
Oh, 
what does this mean! 
It can't be that her savings bank is 
busted and the cashier vamoosed ! ! ' Tis but a 
shat-
tered thought passing through my crooked brain like the 
squeak of a 
guinea hen. 
Ah! I 
begin to weaken. (Puts 
hand to head). 
I 
feel faint. 
(Smells of demijohn). 
Oh, 
what is this that penetrates my nostrils and tickles my 
eyebrows. 
Yes, it is! 
No, it's hartshorn 
I 
will take a 
horn. (Puts demijohn to his mouth). 
Ah! ugh! I 
feel as 
if I'd swallowed a 
hornet's nest and each particular hornet 
was rushing through my brain like a 
dummy engine on an 
elevated road. 
Ah! 
She breathes. 
I 
hear the sweet 
music of her whisper buzzing in my ear like a 
bumble bee 
in an empty barrel. (
Listens). 
What does she say ? 
Un-
loosen my neck-tie? 
(
Looks about). 
Well, I 
suppose I 
must. (Turns her chair around so the back faces the audi-
ence and her head is in full view above back of chair. . Busi-
ness of taking off her neck- tie and holds up to view a long 
striped stocking). 
That's the queerest looking neck- tie I 
ever saw. 
Looks like a 
barber's pole ironed out. 
(Throws 
it on, the table). 
Ah, she whispers again. 
(
Listens). 
Take 
them out! 
Take what out ? I 
wonder what she means. 
(Goes to her and gets boxing-glove). 
Al), she has removed it 
herself. 
(Examines glove. 
Amazed). 
What is 
this a 
padding ? (
lioNs it up to view). 
No, by heavings, it's a 
boxing-glove! 
Ah, that accounts for the heavy breathing 
and pugilistic heaving beneath her neck- tie. 
Oh, how 
much better she must feel after disgorging this turkey 
stUffing. ( Gets the other glove). 
What! another! Now the 
plot thickens and the robbers come on. 
I 
see it all. 
She's 
been a 
sailor's wife and familiar with sparring. 
No, she's 
a 
box-maker, and these are some of het boxing materials. 
(Looks at her). 
Ah, she revives. 
She recovers! 
(Goes to 
her. 
Feels of her face). 
No, those cheeks are still cold, 
with their lily-whiteness and feel like a 
fresh coat of paint 
on a 
cellar door. 
Oh, something must be done to instill

[THE FASCINATING WIDOW:—Continued,J 
life in this frail form. I 
will bathe her head with this 
crooked whiskey and it may straighten her up. 
(Bathes her 
head from demijohn, fixes her hair so it hangs over the back 
of chair, strokes it down, and it suddenly falls off. 
Starts in 
horror). 
What is this I 
behold ? (She exposes to view.a full 
bald head above the back of chair). 
No! Yes! 
It is that 
villainous whiskey has penetrated her brain and scalped 
her bare as a 
billiard ball! 
Now my firm nerves tremble 
and I 
shake like a 
man throwing dice and betting his last 
dollar. 
Oh, I 
can stand this no longer. 
I 
must call in a 
doctor before she dies, her hair on my hands. (Shouts 
aloud). 
Here, Betty, Susan, Jane, Maria, or anybody else. 
_ Come, quick. 
Your mistress is very ill and falling all 
apart. 
(Looks about). 
Oh, for something to steady my 
shattered nerves. 
(Puts demijohn to his mouth). 
[V B.—During the dialogue of Jones the man in the chair 
has drawn in his dress so as to make his form look as small as 
possible, leaving the paddings on the chair]. 
JD*. Jones ( in despair). — 011, nobody cometh ! 
What 
shall I 
do? 
(Goes to her and pleads). 
Oh, my adored 
Roseanna, Pauline, Juliet, Ophelia, smile on me once 
more. 
Let me hear the wink of thine eyebrow and see 
the tones of thy sweet voice ? 
(
Starts up). 
Can this be 
death? 
No, ' tis but the sudden collapse of immensity 
into condensity! 
Oh, I 
can stand this no longer! 
If 
somebody don't come to her, I'll bring her to somebody. 
(Seizes and shakes her). 
Here, wake up old woman! 
What's the matter with you ? 
Are you going to snooze 
here an night ?

(Mrs. Broien jumps up and rubs her eyes, looks about be-
wildered). 
Mrs. Brown. — Oh, what is this I Have I

Yes, I

I've been asleep and dreamt I was in

DINGELEENDER'S MULE. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
keep a

De finest teams in all de vorld I'm sure you viii find dere, 
Among de many who have got deir horses in my place, 
Is Dingelbender, und he owns a

Cllonus. 
Of all de droubles dot I've had since first I 
vent to school, 
I 
don't clink anyding's as had as Dingelbender's mule. 
Of I

Und for his broder dree miles off he loudly den viii bray; 
Dot vakes up all de horses den, und such an awful noise 
As dey viii make, ' twould drive you mad, but I'm vone of de 
boys. 
SPOKEN.—He is vone of de nicest mules, sound und kind in 
harness—of you can ontly get id on him—dot dere is in de

He vos an awful kicker dough; he can kick de barn 
into kindling wood in aboud two seconds. 
I

made a

He ain't much of a

und dot ain't very pleasant.

ITS SIMPLY IMMtislit. 
Composed and sung by CHARLES KONOLLMAN, and sung 
by him at the Third Avenue Theatre, N Y., with great 
success. 
New by-words we now have enough— 
Aye! hundreds, and.plenty to spare, 
They are cited by the high-toned and rough, 
But the latest J 
think takes the.chair ; 
You'll hear it wherever you go, 
And at it you'll not take offense, 
So I'll give it without more ado— 
The latest word out is " Immense." 
" 
You're a 
snide," and a " bloat," are played out, 
And " What do yer say ?" has no sense, 
But the latest of all you'll admit 
It suits, and " It's Simply Immense." 
We've affairs that have troubled our land, 
Concerning the people and State, 
The perambulation of Tweed 
In eluding the law was first rate; 
Now in Ludlow Street Jail he been caged, 
Minus some dollars and cents, 
And the police do proudly relate 
That his capture, you know, was " Immense." 
CHORUS. 
"Pull Down Your Vest" is played out, 
And " Wipe off Your Chin" had no sense, 
But the latest you all will admit 
It suits, and " It's Simply Immense." 
In Brooklyn's great hour of sorrow 
Let us willingly stretch forth our hands, 
To help the poor widows and orphans, 
Rendered helpless through fire's fell brand ; 
The generosity of the actors we admire, 
It will be cited a 
century hence, 
Their generosity they showed by their wallets, 
And that you must say was " IMmense." 
CHORUS. 
So follow the actors' example, 
In the matter of dollars and cents, 
Let your sorrow be of these a 
sample, 
Then we shall say, 
you are " Immense." 
Now to an end my song does approach, 
And I 
hope it's not been out of place, 
And that you don't think I 
encroach, 
But appreciate my efforts with grace; 
And if I 
ask for your applause, 
I 
hope you'll not take offence, 
And call here another time, 
Then you may think Charlie " Immense." 
CHORUS. 
" 
Pull Dorn the Blind's" getting dim, 
" 
Turn Down your Collar" had no sense, 
But this late one you all will admit 
It suits, and It's Simply Immense."

R. 
DEFINHOFF, Washington, D. C. 
Soon I 
will leave thee, 
My dear German Home, 
In a 
new land afar oft, 
A stranger I'll roam; 
Away from the friends 
Who have loved me so dear, 
But though far away, 
In my heart ever near. 
CHORUS. 
My old German Home, 
On the banks of the Rhine, 
May the sun of prosperity 
On it brightly shine; 
I'm going to leave thee, 
Afar off to roam, 
But I'll never forget 
My old German Home. 
I 
sec around me, 
Those friends kind and true, 
Who have loved me since child, 
'Tis hard to leave you; 
Soon I 
will come back 
To this good home once more, 
May prosperity attend you, j 
As in days of yore.

Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And .he sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, witk a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, than of strength and will, 
Never does the streanilet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait Dot till to- morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
^ Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Oh the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill wi'l never grind with the water that is past.

If I

Just for a 
week mid a

I

Und everything jolly mid gay, 
I'd give the poor man lots of stamps, 
Und husband's to all de old maids, 
I'd make it good times all der while 
In every kind of business und trades. 
Spoken..--Dot's so easy genuff, for you see— 
CHORUS. 
Dot's kind of vellar dot I

Nottings was mean about me, 
If all der world was just like me, 
What a 
bully old world it would be. 
Lager should flow free as wasser, 
Beggars should eat quail on toast, 
Und all boliticians have office, 
Und poverty give up der ghost, 
I'd give all them pooty gals beaux, 
Und sweethearts to all der young men, 
Und all deni nice widows in town 
I'd give bully husbands again.

Und drink out myself every day, 
Und dot's wot I'd do all der while

IT TAKES 'US GIRLS. 
Written by SAUL SERTREW. 
I've often heard some people say 
That wc are little fools, 
They try to make us all obey 
Just like a 
pack of mules, 
But we arc up to snuff they find, 
Not green as we have been, 
And when to fool them we're inclined, 
It takes us girls to win. 
Spoken.—Yes, and when they come to see us once or 
twice a 
week and swear they love us and all that sort of 
nonsense, they think we believe them. 
Of course they 
never told the same story to a 
half a 
hundred other girls. 
Oh; no! 
Like the little boy that was whipped, they think 
they're smart, but — 
Cnonus. 
It takes us girls to find them out 
in just the sweetest way. 
We rule them all beyond a 
doubt, 
These butterflies so gay. 
Oh, when we want to gain our case 
We shed some lovely tears, 
And just put on the saddest face 
To fool our gentle dears, 
Silk dresses then and cluster rings 
They lay before our feet, 
To shut their eyes, the silly things, 
It takes us girls so sweet. 
+23 
Spoken. — Yes, and when we married ones want any 
pocket money and our spouses object, don't we pout and 
sulk! " Darling," we say, " give me a 
thousand. I 
want 
to buy this and that." " But, my dear," they say, " you 
will ruin me! I 
can't do it." " Then if you won't 1'11 in-
vite mother to come and stay a year with us!" 
That's 
enough! Down comes the cash. 
You see 
(Chorus). 
They won't believe we're wiser grown, 
They're blinder than the bat, 
The wicked reign of man has flown, 
We give them tit for tat, 
We'll never give their heart's repose 
When once our minds are set, 
To lead them gently by the nose, 
It takes us girls you bet. 
Spoken.-7—And when they come home late in the morning 
and take the door mat for a French bedstead, don't we 
lead them up stairs and put them in their little bed and 
tuck them in, and then go through their clothes to see if 
they've got any rents in their pockets. 
And if they have 
don't we collect those rents, and don't we bathe their 
headsiin the morning in the gentlest way, when they tell 
us the lobster salad made them so sick! 
Then they 
chuckle to themselves and think we believe them, but 
you know— 
(Chorus).

ITS IN THE AIR. 
Written by SAUL SERTIIEW. 
Ant.—" Hildebrandt Montrose." 
I've got for you a 
little song, 
It's something gay and nobby, 
And just to have a 
bye-word now, 
I'll sing to you the hobby, 
If r 
nything's the matter 
And causes folks to stare, 
And they should ask the reason why, 
Just say it's in the air. 
CHORUS. 
It' in the air I 
do declare, 
There's something going round, it must be in the air 
If anything is the matter or causes folks to stare, 
The question now arises, it must be in the air. 
I 
met a 
friend the other day, 
his nose looked like a 
cherry, 
his head looked like if some one had 
Been punching to a 
jelly, 
Says I, Oh, what's the matter 
You took a 
perfect scare, 
Says he I've been on Blackwell's Isle, 
A taking the country air. 
(C/torus). 
The girls now- a- days when they look pale 
Resort no more to painting, 
They pinch each other's cheeks until 
With pain they're almost fainting, 
When beaux they have been kissing, 
They always will declare 
When asked what makes their cheeks so red 
They've been out in the air. 
(U/torus). 
The other night I 
took a 
stroll 
To see the sights enchanting, 
A fellow staggered up to me, 
A fight I 
thought was wanting, 
Says I, Oh, what's the matter? 
His eyes began to glare, 
Says he may be you think I'm drunk, 
I 
tell " yer" it's in the air ! 
(Cho, 
The world seems turning upside down, 
Things are in a 
muddle, 
The savings banks are bursting up 
And cashiers they " skedaddle," 
And when you ask the reason, 
The question they declare, 
They all do it now-a-days, 
it must be in the air. 
This little song is something new, 
To please you I've been trying, 
The words I 
know you'll recollect 
The " air" outside is flying, 
And if the song it pleases 
Is what I 
mostly care, 
So good-by, boys, I'm going now 
To take a 
little air. 
(C/torus). 
(Chorus).

HOW DO THEY DO IT? 
Is— 
Written by SAUL SERTREW. 
AIR.-" How Does He Do It?" 
How very queer the things we hear 
While strolling through the city, 
And some are good and some are bad, 
And some are sharp '
and witty, 
But any one that now-a-days 
Who dresses in the fashion, 
Or asks a 
friend to dine with him 
Or wears a 
diamond flashing, 
And lives somewhere in Baxter street, 
The comment of every one you'll nied 
CHORUS. 
How does he do it ? 
How does he it ? 
How does he do so well ? 
How does he do it—so nicely get through'it ? 
No one but he can tell. 
But should a 
gent who lives up town 
In royal style and fashion, 
With coaching clubs lie drives -around 
His four-in-hand so dashing, 
Ten million dollars should he steal 
Asomgromise will follow, 
He bags five millions for himself, 
And is called a 
jolly fellow, 
And why tprison he 'don't go 
Nobody asks or wants to know. 
(Chorus). ) 
Now when a 
married man who works 
For seven dollars weekly, 
And fourteen children and a 
wife 
He feeds and dresses neatly, 
his mother-in-law comes to slab 
And four or five country cousins, 
An aunt or two that he don't know, 
With cats anc dogs by dozens, 
if he don't grumble, drink or swear, 
Can any one tell me hear. 
(Chorus). 
If any person of renown. 
A merchant or importer, 
All for their health go out of town 
Just when they hadn't ought to, 
Its suicide the papers bawl 
And make a 
dreadful clatter, 
But should they come back 0. K flail 
It's quite a 
different matter, 
The thing is hushed up right away, 
6ix months you'll get it you should say. 
(Chorus).

When hope smiled on my life's dawning, 
For I

By my side then tripped a

Passing fair and dreaming eyed, 
Ruby smiles and eyes love laden, 
Revealing thoughts her tongue denied.

Since Katy Joined The Gang. 
Words by Roy DiSLIE. 
I 
was out very late last Tuesday night, 
'Till the hour of half past two, 
When my Kitty once went to Burlington Hall, 
Wid a 
girl by the name of McHugh, 
She stayed out late that very night, 
Done something I 
couldn't understand, 
And she gave me the slip and away she tripped, 
Along with Kitty and the rest of the gang. 
CHORUS. 
She went up to the hall and put on the gall, 
Outside ot the door she'll stand, 
And she'll break her darling neck or get in on a 
check, 
Since Kitty first joined the gang. 
She went up to Michigan avenue 
To see a 
girl by the name of Hayes, 
She told darned lies and kicked up a 
row 
'Till the poor girl lost her place; 
Bordelia had time to pack her trunk, 
Wid her bundles and her baggage in her hand 
She took an oath on the book, 
She'd go down and lick the cook along with 
Kitty and the rest of the gang. 
CHORUS. 
She comes a 
rolling home in the morning. 
And gives the door the divils own bang, 
My heart is broke, God Almighty knows, 
Since Kitty she has joined the gang. 
She promenades South Clark Street 
"rill her shoes they leave her feet, 
She'll go twice around the block 
And skip across the bridge 
And sauce every one on the street, 
The gang made a 
raid on a 
bakery wagon, 
If they didn't I 
hope to be hanged, 
And they ate mince pies 
'Till they couldn't shut their eyes, 
And they choked every one in the gang. 
Cnonus. 
In the morning they were brought to the City Court, 
Ten dollars and costs they couldn't stand, 
And the Interocean says they've got thirty days 
For going with a 
darn bard gang.

M OI1TON. 
When telling that same ancient story, 
That's new since the days of the ark, 
That soul thrilling moment of pleasure, 
That gleam of love's light thro' the dark; 
Our hopes and our fears are all waiting, 
One word from a 
fair maiden's lip, 
If " no " all the world is a 
desert, 
If " yes" life's best nectar we sip. 
CHORUS. 
Our hopes and our fears are all waiting, 
One word from a 
fair maiden's lip, 
If " no ' all the world is a 
desert, 
If " yes" life's best nectar we sip. 
A 
blessing, just then, is a 
baby, 
Who comes as if sent from above, 
To say to our sweetheart that really, 
" 
What we call 'espect, he calls love;" 
And when the sweet damsel surrenders, 
Excuse for most exquisite bliss, 
The quiet remark of the young one, 
" 
Whoever I 
love, why, I 
kiss." 
(Chorus). 
" 
All! babies, though mar- plots, you're jewels," 
If one has the talent to take 
The proper amount of advantage, 
Of all the queer blunders you make; 
And many a 
lover has reason, 
To bless for the whole of his life, 
The infant whose timely intrusion, 
Compelled him to ask for his wife. 
(Chorus).

THE LAGER KEG. 
PARODY. 
Written by SAUL SEUTREW. 
Ain.—" The Water Mill." 
Listen to the lager beer all the live long day, 
Buzzing in its little keg, mad to get away, 
Rushing reckless in the glows when you turn the peg, 
Never coming back again to that lager keg, 
Then this reckless lager beer comes to grief at last, 
Th.-3 
keg will never buzz again with the lager that 
has passed. 
Many are the schooners now, Johnny, you and I, 
We have got away with, 0, when our lips were dry, 
Anti the happy times we've had with our friends so gay, 
Shaking for this lager beer and seeing who should pay, 
But those happy times are gone I 
am broke at last, 
The keg will never buzz again with the lager that 
has passed. 
Take this lesson to yourself every one of you, 
Always look before you leap, that's the way to do, 
Don't be like this lager keg, rushing to the brink, 
Gobbled by some Dutchman then thirsting for a 
drink 
When you've got a 
good thing now keep it, clinch it 
fast, 
The keg will never buzz again with the lager that 
has passed.

A Cunundrum I Can Rardly 
Understand. 
Mginally sung by W ILL H. M ORTON, America's Comique, at the 
Holiday Street Theatre, Baltimore, Md. 
This world's a 
mighty riddle, very difficult to solve, 
Is a 
maxim that you'll hear on every side, 
It's agame of cards in fine, although money's lost and Won, 
While struggling both with poverty and pride, 
For instance there's the poor man that laliors for his 
bread, 
When trials and want assail his every hand, 
-Where's the money that's been paid to assist him I'm 
afraid 
Is a 
conundrum I 
can scarcely understand. 
This nation is a 
great one, at least so people say, 
But there's fishes in the sea that ain't been caught, 
And the style that we've been ruled, plainly tells us 
we've been fooled, 
Even Congressmen ain't honest as they aught, 
But still many things that in our memory rings, 
Of men whose lip and purposes were grand, 
Why Boss Tweed died in prison, while his partners they 
went free, 
Is a 
conundrum I 
can scarcely understand. 
You have heard it doubtless said that a 
fool is easy led, 
it's a 
saying that is sometimes very true, 
But curious to relate how in these United States 
There's a 
class of men known by most of you, 
I 
mean actors that are bad, there are hundreds to be had, 
Yes, a 
thousand waiting if you should command, 
With the salary managers give, how in heaven's name 
they live, 
Is a 
conundrum I 
can scarcely understand,

of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol.

ever written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." The poet' 
linee

Untainted yet by art. 
Was noble, just, humane and kind. 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spoiler came—" 
this book, in the language of Mrs. Howson, " affords a 
striking example 
that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the end only leads 
to misery and shame." •"

These Cards are arr-nged and printed in series—Hi arts, Clubs, Dia-
Mends and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen. 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
Jour rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an. 
wirers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diftl. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result M this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of qLsations and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
40 adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players. 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
