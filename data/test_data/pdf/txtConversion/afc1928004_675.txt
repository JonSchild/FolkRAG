FISHER, 1881, 
I've a (laughter Clarabel, 
She's a 
rose-bud rich and rare; 
She wears her brother's derby 
And she bangs her own false hair. 
Her nose is Grieco-Roman, 
her chromo you can see; 
Just gaze upon the father 
Of sweet Clarabel Magee. 
0! so sweet is Clarabel—Break. 
She smashes every swell—Break. 
When she is at a 
ball 
'Twould break your heart to see, 
How mashers fight to get a 
dance 
With Clarabel Magee. 
Oh! she has lots of beauxs, 
There is now a 
bitter strife 
Between Millionaires and Aldermen, 
To get her for a 
wife; 
F,itys she I 
can't marry all, 
Says I 
then chuck the dice and see 
What happy man will win the hand 
Of Clarabel Magee.

MULCAHEY'S COUSIN DAN. 
A Recitation. 
Written for PAT ROONEY b3. " Den Morton'• 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER. tss.. 
The Half-Breeds and the Stalwarts 
Had a 
roup.-,h-and-tumble fight, 
The Half-Breeds had Jim Blaine for a 
leader, 
The Stalwarts said Conklin was right; 
Like Kilkenny cats they fought, 
Like bulldogs, did growl and grin; 
And though Conklin's friends fought nobly. 
The man from Maine did win. 
Now, I'm neither a 
Half-Breed or Stalwart, 
To no party do I 
belong; 
And though for the spoils they wrangle, 
I 
say both sides were wrong. 
To settle this whole question, 
I 
have an easy plan; 
It is, to make a 
United States' Senator of 
Mulcahey's Cousin Dan. 
If Mulcahey's cousin was Senator, 
He'd make a 
change all round; 
No thieving star route jobbers 
In this country would be found; 
Beecher who says that a 
poor man 
Should live upon water and bread, 
Would have to kiss the Plymouth Church ladies, 
While he stood upon his head.

IIULCAHEY'S COUSIN DAN.—CONTINUED. 
In the Tombs windy Talmadge, 
Four months, three times a 
year would get; 
I 
would play Billee Taylor 
In the tragedy of Olivette. 
I'd then take Susan Anthony, 
And turn her into a 
man; 
If they made a 
United States' Senator of 
Mulcahey's Cousin Dan. 
He'd sweep the stieets of New York with Captain 
Williams, 
He'd then bounce Mayor Grace; 
And make Owney Geoghegan 
Run the City Hall in his place. 
He'd run the 3d avenue cars to Ireland, 
And steamboats to the skies; 
he'd make bran new electric lights 
Out of the crusts of apple pies. 
He'd make Dennis Kearney president, 
Then the Chinese would have to go; 
Christmas would come in summer, 
On 4th of July we'd have snow. 
The Bulls and Bears of Wall street, 
In the Central Park would stand; 
When we make a 
ITr. ited States' senator of 
31Uicahey's Cousin Dan.

Katie Dear. 
As sung by PAT Roomtv. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
My Katie dear, my Katie dear, 
It's her I'm going for to see; 
I'm going to take her to a 
dance to-night, 
And it's happy we will be, 
She's not very stout, she's not very thin, 
But I 
want you all to understand, 
To sing a 
song or dance a 
jig 
She can beat all the girls in the land. 
CHORUS. 
She can sing, (AYrn) 
She can sing, (Sym.) 
She's my Irish colleen everybody knows. 
Arrah, whenever a 
fiddle begins to play 
Now this is the way she goes— 
(Dance.) 
My Katie dear, my little Katie dear, 
We're going to be married soon; 
I 
feel so happy, boys and girls, 
And as proud as the richest gossoon. 
And when we settle down in — 
here, 
All the people in the town we'll invite. 
You can bet your dime we'll have a 
good time 
We'll not go home till broad daylight. 
CHORUS. 
We will sing, ( Sym.) 
We will dance, ( Sym.) 
We'll have a 
good time, now remember, sure, 
And when old Murphy squeezes the pipes, 
It's then we'll welt the floor.

Copyright secured, 1876, by A. J. FrssEr.. 
4,s ,S
g with unbounded applause, by PAT Pv-mniF.r, at 
the Olympic Theatre. 
All the trials and troubles— 
To you I 
will relate— 
That I 
have had to undergo 
Through being a 
candidate; 
I 
always lived a 
quiet life, 
Until one Mike McCann, 
He came to me, and says, Duffle, 
You must run for Alderman. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas in the 7th Ward below, 
In a 
neighborhood they call Cork sow; 
Where the boys of me made a 
holy show, 
When I 
ran for Alderman. 
It was in McCann's back room, 
That night they nominated me; 
I 
axed the boys to have a 
drink, 
As they gave me three times three; 
They drank and smoked, they smoked and dran.k, 
'Till drunk was every man ; 
'Twas all at the expense 
Of poor Pat Duffle, the Alderman. 
'Twas in the. (16e. 
But when election day it came, 
I 
found out very soon, 
The boys had all gone back on me, 
And were voting for Muldoon; 
And when I 
axed the raison why— 
To laugh, they all began— 
Saying, we don't want no Tarrier, 
For to be our Alderman. 
'Twas in the Rzo.

MY ELDEST DAUGHTER CLARA. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, I880. 
Written by James Richmond for Pat Rooney and sure 
by him with great success. 
Sure I 
have a 
lovely daughter, 
On the stage she cuts a 
dash, 
She wears blonde wigs and powders her face, 
To try and catch a 
mash. 
She can dance a 
tailor's hornpipe, 
She tells the old woman that she is fine, 
She wears flesh colored pants when sh.: comes 
out to dance, 
And gets drunk on German wine. 
CHORUS. 
She wears dizzy diamonds and wings on her back, [ break 
In the ballet dance she is like a 
jumping jack, (break., 
She has a 
barrel of paint on her face, 
Like a 
fairy from Conamarra,. 
The pride of the McCormick family, 
Is my eldest daughter Clara. 
You should see her in the can-can, 
She is the dead picture of her ma, 
She has a 
foot as big as a 
telegraph pole, 
Her features are like her pa. 
She has all the swells near crazy, 
An engagement for life she has signed, 
She is hitched to a 
man named Freddie NIcCan, 
He has a 
million dollars in his mind. 
McCIEE THE WIDOWER. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND for PAT ROONEY, and sung by hint 
with great success. 
I 
am a 
putty Irish widower of thirty, 
Married again now sure I'd like to be; 
My wife she died from being temperate, 
Of children I 
have only three; 
There is Tommy, Johanna and Katie, 
The eldest just eight years old! 
They're as purty as any Yankee children, 
I 
wouldn't sell them for their weight in gold. 
Cnottus: 
Then if there is a 
nice, young lady here, 
Let her write a 
love letter to me; 
For a 
husband she could find no better, 
Than the Honorable Mr. Jeremiah McGee. 
I 
don't want a 
flirt or a 
masher, 
I'd like a 
saleslady or a 
dry goods' clerk; 
1 
want an industrious young lady, 
That can do a 
good day's hard work; 
rd love her as long as I 
am living, 
If my orphans she does admire; 
She'll have to cook the breakfast in the morning, 
Scrub the floor and make the fire.

Sung with immense success 
by PAT ROONEY. 
Good evening, to ye, Gents and Ladies, 
rve come to make a 
little call ; 
I'm descended from the great O'Grady's, 
The best you'll find in Donegal. 
A 
year ago I 
took the notion 
To sail across the briny deep ; 
The sea was in a 
great commotion, 
I 
coald'nt get a 
wink of sleep. 
C11013US. 
They call me roaming Mick O'Brien, 
I'll fight ' till I'm pushed to the wall, 
The young girls they were all a 
crying 
When I 
came from old Donegal. 
S 
are I 
was known throughout the country, 
And devil the one with me could dance ; 
I 
was the first in every nation— 
And drunk when I 
had the chance 
I 
used to drive the women crazy, 
So nimbly I 
could shake my feet ; 
They never found me slow or lazy, 
At jigging I 
could not be beat. 
They call me roaming Mick, &e. 
Cheese It, Jimmie, Cheese It. 
Written by Edwin Talbot, and sung with great suceess 
Pat Rooney. 
AIR— Bogie Man. 
The boys hanging around the public baths, 
How patiently they wait, 
The policeman tries to keep them quiet, 
And pass them in the gate, 
They push and pull to sneak in twice, 
And get another swim, 
But the copper drops and tells them, 
Young fellow that's too thin. 
CHORUS. 
Then cheese it, Jimmy, cheese it, 
Now lay bones for your chance, 
Don't you see the copper wii I 
sneak, 
And situr. in the pants. 
Then cheese it, Petey, cheese it, 
I 
tell you he will drop, 
Now go and dry your hair now quick, 
Now sherry here is the cop. 
They put seventeen boys in a 
little room, 
About as big as a 
dry goods box, 
You'll hear them say, my 
clothes is wet, 
I 
wonder where is rocks, 
They put on their shoes upon the dock, 
Buy a 
bolivar if the've got tin. 
TLen dry up their hair and watch the police, 
And work the bath again.

Arrah, my name is Isaac Murphy, 
And FL have ye all to know 
That I 
was born in China, 
Near the county of Mayo. 
I 
can walk six months and never stop, 
I 
can run faster than a 
train ; 
Faith, I 
am soon going over to England, 
To bring the belt Rowell took back again. 
CHORUS. 
I'll walk the first hundird miles on my head, 
The second on my toes; 
The third I'll walk on my eye-brows, 
And the fourth upon my nose. 
The fifth and last I'll walk on my ear, 
Then the Atlantic I 
walk across, 
Sure the Philadelphia Bladder says, 
Of all walkers I 
am the boss. 
I 
can walk from here to Australia and back 
In about three days and a 
half, 
Or around the world in a 
hundred hours— 
When I 
told O'Leary he gave me the laugh. 
I 
can walk for a 
year without any sleep, 
And keep waltzing around on the track; 
It would take me ninety minutes, just, 
To walk from here to Germany and back. 
I'll walk the first hundred, & c.

I'm a 
man that's known both far and near, 
McCluskey that's my name, 
An' all the politicians, sure, 
Are envious of my fame; 
I 
got a 
grip in the auld Sixth Ward., 
And ye bet I 
make it pay, 
An' I 
hould a 
high position 
Upon Election Day. 
CHORUS. 
As I 
walk through the ward, 
As proud as a 
lord, 
The gang rise their hats and cry out, " Cleesr 
the way." 
Oh I 
for style an' for air, 
There is none to compare 
Wid McCluskey on Election Day. 
It was on last election time, 
I 
ran for Alderman, 
My political antagonist 
Was a 
loafer named McCann; 
But I 
trated all the boys I 
met, 
From Harlem to Cow Bay, 
And they said they'd vote nine times for me 
Upon Election Day. 
As I 
walk, &c. 
Election time came quickly round, 
I 
wint to make a 
speech, 
But the gang they knocked theeplatforrn down, 
And I 
loud for help did screech. 
Now although I 
didn't get the place, 
Just listen to what I'll say, 
t'll play them all for suckers 
On next Election Day. 
As I 
walk, &c.

You've heard of McCormick, the politician 
But T

And for grammar I

I 
was seventeen years a 
Congressman, 
And in the Treasury I 
made a 
big dent ; 
I'll have no trade dollars, but all iron 'none, 
When Muldoon is your President. 
CHORUS.

brown stone front, 
And the laboring man free rent ; 
I'll make politicians walk on their hands to save Oretr hotit 
When Muldoon is your President. 
Ill have iron railings around New York, 
I'll build a 
railroad across the sea; 
I'll move Central Park to Washington, 
You can ride to California free. 
I'll tear down all the Elevated roads; 
No more Governors will be my intent; 
ill have steamboats running by telegraph 
When Muldoon is your President. 
I'll give every bootblack, &c.

lie married old Corbin down at Manhattan Beach ; 
He married them in a 
cellar, he nin.t have been in a

wooden 
pair of pants. 
Ile bought a 
gold mine in Hoboken, and lie fuund nothing

Ile went crazy and mad and cut his throat—with a

He was found guilty of arson and stealing twenty gold rings, 
Then he was taken

ONE OF MY MOTHER'S TWINS. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY with wonderful success. 
I 
am a 
Butcher by occupation, 
And a 
Congressman by trade; 
I 
was born in Kilkenny, 
Yes, that's where I 
was made; 
I 
love a 
little Dutch brunette, 
in a 
beer saloon where I 
reside; 
I 
asked her to be my husband, 
And she said that I 
was snide. 
CHORUS: 
She is just as purty as a 
Limburger Cheese, 
And her Father peddles tins; 
She says she cannot marry me; 
'Cause I'm one of my Mother's twins. 
I 
got mashed upon her sister, 
And to a 
party once we went; 
She wouldn't let me kiss her, 
After I 
spent about a 
cent; 
I 
hired a 
cab and we walked home, 
I 
took her by the wrist; 
Again I 
asked her for a 
kiss, 
And she smashed me with her fist. 
SPOKEN —I 
felt so bad I 
could buy a 
new suit of clothes. 
I 
commenced to cry, not because I 
got hit, but I 
thought 
she hurt her hand, and I 
went away crying, 
She is just as purty, etc. 
McCORMICK'S MULE. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND. 
Recited by PAT ROONEY with great suecesi. 
McCormick had a 
Jack-ass, 
Blind in the teeth, lame in one eye; 
lie had a 
celebrated record, 
For eating water and drinking pie; 
This Jack-ass was a 
high kicker, 
He won many an undisputed prize; 
lie kicked out seven rows of Mrs. Murphy's teeth, 
And jabbed out both her eyes. 
McCormick's Mule 
This mule was born in Ireland, 
lie wears the Shamrock on his nose; 
At the Centennial he stole an iron safe, 
And dressed himself in a 
suit of clothes; 
lie broke into a 
Jewelry store, 
Stabbed the proprietor with a 
nail; 
Chased four Policeman into the river, 
And set tire to the Jail.

McCormick's Mule 
McCormick was arrested, and produced the mule, 
For him all the neighbors had a 
grudge; 
lie slapped the Jury in the mouth with his tail, 
And kicked the neck-tie off the Judge; 
The mule escaped, and they held McCormick, 
For the doings of the mule he was tried; 
He was just getting ten years' sentence, 
When a 
telegram came the mule had died. 
McCormick's Mule 
Moral on his Grave-Stone. 
Judge me as a 
Jack-ass, 
Or judge me as a 
fool; 
I 
was smarter than some politicians, 
That went to Grammar School: 
I 
had the brains of a 
mighty man, 
But for one I 
could not pass; 
Bo please have printed on my grav-;._

Sung with great success by PAT ROONEY. 
I'm a 
lighthearted Paddy, a 
ride Irish laddy, 
I 
went to America strange wonders to say ; 
I 
sailed from dear Cork for the port of New York, 
I 
was eighteen long days a 
crossing the say. 
When I 
arrived in the land I 
was tuck by the hand 
By a

And I

CHORUS. 
I'm Tim Flaherty, arah, gaze upon me ; 
A 
lighthearted Paddy is Tim Flaherty. 
He showed me around, the sights were soon found, 
I 
viewed them with wonder and astonishment: 
When he bade me good-bye, tears came in my eye, 
I 
found he'd been through me, and took iv'ry cint, 
What to do I 
didn't know, where was I 
to go ; 
So I 
v,,int to the Coort, and explained to the Judge. 
He called me a 
pauper, a 
vagrant and loafer, 
And gave me six months in the Island above. 
I'm Tim Flaherty, ..icc • 
So I 
shouldered my bundle, and homeward I 
wandered. 
Ould Erin forever, oh, she is my joy ! 
It's here I'm at home, and never will roam, 
For she's good. enough for a 
rale Irish boy. 
Sure, there's whiskey galore, just here by the door. 
And beauties you ne'er can find afar o'er the say 
And the girls are so pretty, so nate and Sc) witty, 
And that's just what suits the lad, Tim Flaherty.

My name it is McGinty, yes, 
I 
live on ham and flour, 
With O'Leary, the walker, I 
came here, 
For to walk a 
mile an hour, 
About half past twelve o'clock last night 
A 
gang gave me a 
terrible fright, 
They woke me up and set me tight, 
For to walk against O'Leary. 
They took me to a

And with alcohol set me crazy, 
They stripped me clothes off to the skin, 
And rt made me feel so lazy; 
It was then the gang commenced to talk, 
Saying who is the terrier going to walk, 
And they said they would hang me if I'd bauk 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
The first mile I 
walked my legs were weak, 
And the gang commenced to holler, 
They sprinkled salt upon the track 
And hit me with an iron dollar. 
All the other walkers were ahead, 
Eating sponge cake, pie and bread, 
0 
heavens, I 
wish that I 
was dead, 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
I 
walked until I 
catched the cramps, 
Around and around the track, 
All the ladies threw bouquets at me, 
Tnere was a 
corn upon my back; 
The judge told me it was time to stop 
As around the track like a 
chicken I'd flop, 
For the want of a

Upon this earth to- day ; 
And the cause of it I'll tell to you 
In my own peculiar way :

To no more Target Excursions

For now she'll have to stay at home 
And wash, iron, cook, and mend;

And learn her to dance another step

I 
tries to raise my children up the very best I 
can; 
But with my daughter Mary Ann I 
don't know what to do. 
For she's learned a 
kind of dancing that they call the 
Tra-la-la-loo!

S;nce Mary Ann learned how to dance, 
; 
don't know what to do; 
She's out all night 'till broad daylight, 
A 
dancing the Tra-la-la-loo ! 
On every moonlight pic-nic sure my daughter can be found. 
And when I 
bid her stay at home she says, Go feel around ;" 
And on starlight excursions, where the band plays Flewy-
come-flew, 
'Tis there I'll find my Mary Ann a 
skipping the Tra-la-la-loo! 
Since Mary Ann, &c. 
Bad luck to moonlight pic-nics, they have ruined Mary Ann, 
Since first she learned to pivot with young Terry and his

But if I

She's gone to the divll intirely, since she learned the

Jerry Slattery., 
As sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J FISHER, 1879. 
Jerry Slattery was a 
tailor, he was ninety years of age, 
He had a 
son named Micky, a 
play actor on the stage. 
He'd play Romeo with his sister, for diamonds he'd give her 
pork and beans, 
Then little Michael Slattery would tear the bedclothes up fo-
scenes. 
He is crazy, he is lazy, he broke his leg last week, 
He is always singing, always dancing, and playing tragedy in 
his sleep. 
He is always talking of Mary Anderson, he'd support her or 
the stage, 
Sure last night he got so crazy, we had to put him in a 
cage. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's little Michael Slattery stole his father's pants, 
He cut them up for tights to do a 
song and dance ; 
When his mother was asleep he cut her hair off for a 
wig, 
Now little Micky Slattery is doing an acrobatic jig. 
He cut off his father's whiskers to play Hamlet and King Lear, 
look a 
shot gun to his mother and made her walk off on her ear, 
He learned his sister dancing, cut off eleven of her toes, 
Now little Micky Slattery is singing tenor through his nose. 
For he's dramatic, he's lunatic, he is clean gone off his base, 
His father and his mother say he is 
Celebrated Case, 
He says he takes the cake, as an 
he beats them all, 
Next week he plays Julius Caesar down at Solomon Duff's 
hall. 
Then it's little, &c.

Never take the I

by Harrigan & Hart. 
Every month the rent is handed to the landlord, 
In the tenement house, where the families congregate, 
Then Mrs. Duffy says that Mrs. Reilly's daughter, 
In the sink threw dirty cabbage and corn matc, 
CHORUS. 
Oh, then they get a 
drinking and a 
slugging, 
It's worse than listening to the Pinafore, 
But when Kelly throws ashes at Terry Monaghans mother, 
Arrah, it's then then they chase the landlord from tne 
door. 
Mrs. McNally had sixteen shirts upon a 
clothes line, 
And a 
brand new suit of dresses from the store, 
Young Kelly's son be stole them and he pawned them, 
You can bet she chased the young kid from the door. 
Last night her daughter Mary Ann the speeler, 
Was standing with a 
young man she met before, 
6onie one dropped out a 
scuttle full of cinders, 
To chase the dizzy lovers from the door, 
The milk is left up in the hallway every morning, 
From Jacob McCarthy's german grocery store, 
When he tries to collect his bill they give hint warning, 
And chase the poor old milkman from the door.

SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by B. 
HART. 
Copyrighted by A. 
J. FISHER, 1879. 
Here I 
am, an Irish lad, that you can plainly see, 
I've traveled this world o'er and o'er, till I 
got to this land, 
of the free. 
From Dublin Bay I 
came away, I 
never fret or sigh, 
For I'm always gay, both night and day, this son of Erin's IsN. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I 
am an Irish ranting blade, and that I 
never deny, 
And I'll give you all a 
chance for to see the way I 
dance, 
As they do in Erin's Isle. ( Repeat.) 
The other day I 
went astray, I 
never shall forget, 
'When a 
pretty little Irish girl oh I 
by chance had met. 
She showed me home, that I 
will own, and this was her reply: 
" 
You I 
do adore, and there is something more, you're, a 
son 
of Erin's Isle." 
Yes, I 
am, & c. 
For to return home once more my mind is fully bent, 
And when I 
arrive on the shamrock shore, won't there be a 
grand event. 
My friends and my relations will greet me with all smiles, 
To welcome home one of their own, a 
son of Erin's Isle. 
Yes, I 
am, &c.

Take You Home Again, Kathleen. 
A 
BUNION THAT I 
FOUND IN 
FATHER'S SHOE. 
As sung by W ILL SMITH, With BAIRD'S M INSTRELS. 
I'll take you home again, Kathleen, 
Across the ocean wild and wide; 
To where your heart has ever been, 
Since first you were my bonny bride; 
The roses all have left your cheek, 
I've watched them fade away and die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim your loving eyes. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, I 
will take you back, Kathleen, 
To where your heart will feel no pain; 
And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
I 
know you love me, Kathleen, dear, 
Your heart was ever fond- and true; 
I 
always feel when you are near, 
That life holds nothing dear but you. 
The smiles that once you gave to me, 
I 
scarcely ever see them now; 
Tho' many, many times I 
see 
ajic ' fling ab 
our brow, 
Parody on Flower from Mother's Grave. 
Written and sung by PAUL DRESSER. 
I've had a 
toothpick at home that I've had for ninety days 
The one who gave it does a 
song and dance; 
He wears a 
high silk hat, and carries an actor's ten-cent 
cane, 
You can tell him by the fringe that'b, on his pants, yes, 
at a 
glance; 
But there's one sweet, little relic that I 
can never forget, 
And the giver has long since slid up the flue; 
Oh, it is not a 
faded flower, nor a 
brandy smash and sour, 
It's a 
bunion that I 
found in father's shoe; yes, it is true. 
CHORUS: 
Treasured in my memory like a 
free lunch route, 
Is this little story. true it's yet; 
But I 
never can forget when he whistled Olivette, 
And the bunion that I 
found in father's shoe, the wind, 
it blew. 
Now I 
thought it would be best to tell you papa went out 
West, 
The little Indians struck him deaf and dumb; 
P.2 was not a 
readjuster, yet he'd go upon a 
buster, 
Get full of sherry cobblers and bad rum just like a 
bum; 
Tie was formerly a 
sailor, and he sang in Billee Taylor, 
Every word that I 
have spoken friends, is true; 
Bit he died in Omaha from eating a 
barrel of cold slaw, 
That's where I 
found this little bunion in his shoe; how 
do you do? 
CHORUS: 
Now my story's almost told, yet a 
tale I 
will unfold, 
Of course, you wish to Know what it's about; 
'.2his is the same old shoe that made Senator Platt feel blue, 
It's the one that kicked old Roscoe Conkling out.

COPYRIGHTIM, 1881, by A . .1. FISHER. 
Sung with great success by LESTER ct W ILLIAMS. 
I 
used to own a 
donkey, a 
bob-tail stubborn mule, 
He was born about the year of '49; 
His head was full of scars from stopping Railroad ears, 
He was ring- boned, spavined, deaf and blind; 
He could kick a 
steam engine, and raise you through 
the roof, 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs; 
He died at half past four, he's gone to that beautifu' 
shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CTIOR us: 
Gone to join the angels with spit-curls on his hair, 
Died with epizootic in the head; 
lie might have gone to Congress if he only lived, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
His hoof was like a 
slungshot, he could raise you 
through the roof, 
he'd come into the house and kick you out of bed; 
His feet was full of bunions, he could eat a 
barrel of 
onions, 
And go to sleep a 
standing on his head; 
he'd go to a 
saloon, shove his hoof through a 
spittoon 
And kick the bar into the gutter for a 
joke, 
When he laid down and di d, every mule in Jersey died 
Empty is the stable, Davy's ffone • 
Cnonus: 
Davy's left the stable for the promised land, 
His overshoes and saddle are in pawn; 
No more hay he'll ever chew, they've turned him into 
glue, 
Empty is the stable Davy's gone.

sung by Wm. McALooN in all the principal Theatres in America, anti 
by O'NEIL 8: CONROY. 
Scenes 'of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days: 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant has 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
How well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave.

You may think that r

And the reason I 
will tell you every one; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, and her name was Peggy Doyle, 
And I 
took her to Coney Isle to have some fun. 
She is from the County Down, and she weighs 200 lbs., 
And I 
thought she would be true to me all the while; 
But if I 
had it to do again, she would never go to 
Swim along with me again to Coney Isle. 
CHORUS 
She had salt water there galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile, 
Sure they all did wave their hats, 
And shouted float her Pat, 
The day I 
took my Peg to Coney Isle. 
Now its when we reahed the pier, we went and had some 
beer, 
And after that we went to hq,ve a 
bathe.

But you'd ought to see my Peg upon the waves. 
The gang began to guy us, my bosom was on fire, 
And some ot them gave me a 
grand hurrah! 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth 
Be heavens shouted out, there's one of the lions 
That escaped the other day. Chonis. 
Now of course I 
did feel mad after listening to that lad, 
And I 
know he thought himself quite smart, 
But if I 
had him in New York, up near tne Central Park:, 
You can bet that I 
wt,uld break his heart. 
I 
don't say I'm a 
fighter, a 
cutter or a 
biter, 
But I 
alw ys take my own part all the while; 
Arrah musha! had luck to Peg, 
May she lose one of lit.t legs, 
Before I 
take her again to Coney Island. 
CrEM OF THE EMERALD ISLE. 
ords and Music by PAT FEENEY, and dedicated and sung by 
JOHN W ALSH, the Great Irish Vocalist, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, N. 
Y. 
I'll sing now in praise of the gem of old Ireland, 
Whose names are respected by friend and by foe; 
Of the men who proud to acknowledge their sirelamI 
Of men who gained fame by words and by blow; 
Their hearts brave and true, never knew any danger, 
As cheerfully they for their country did toil; 
It must be acknowledged by friend and by stranger, 
That they were bright gems from the Emeral Isle. 
First is Brian Borue, the great King whose example 
If followed by Monarchs of this present day; 
A 
blessing would prove, for his wisdom was ample, 
He knew how to rule in a 
true Kingly way; 
Brave Patrick Sarsfield, exiled from his sireland, 
Exclaimed as he died on a 
foreigner's soil; 
Oh, may Heaven grant freedom for old Ireland, 
Then died a 
bright gem of the Emerald Isle. 
If we boast of our gems, surely no one can blame mi., 
When we've produced men like those I 
will name; 
Balfe 'Wallace and Tom Moore who made themselvew 
fatuous, 
With music and poetry they gained their fame; 
There's Sherridau, Goldsmith and Swift, three more 
great men, 
What nation on earth ever equaled their 
rhere's Davitt, Daily and Killen, three more great 
Statesmen, 
ll these are bright gems of the Emerald Isle.

Then we all flew for the kitchen.

LOVE OF THE SHAMROCK. 
Written and composed and permission for publication granted by 
Mr. J. K. EMMET. Sung with great success by J. K. EMMET. 
Three little leaves of Irish green, 
United on one stern, 
On Irish Soil are often seen— 
They form a 
magic gem. 
One leaf is truth, and valor, one, 
The other one is love, 
And these three magic leaves are wet 
By dewdrops from above. 
CHORUS: 
Oh! the shamrock, the shamrock, 
The shamrock immortal and green, 
By every nook and every brook 
Grows shamrock so green. 
Oh! do you love, oh! say you love 
The shamrock, emblem of love, 
Oh! say you love the shamrock so green. 
When Irish soil received the plant 
The Elfin kings can tell; 
Love, Truth and Valor wandered there, 
And liked the soil so well. 
Each left an emblem in a 
leaf, 
And these together grew, 
Sustained by heaven's warmest beams, 
And nurtured by the dew. 
To thee I 
give the triple leaf, 
As emblem of my love; 
I 
only hope the modest gift 
May not unwelcome prove. 
A 
flower of more pretensions 
Could not more plainly tell 
The triple faith I 
have in thee, 
Thou shamrock of the dell,

AN IRISHMAN'S TOAST. 
kg, sung with great success by ToNI VASTOR. The greatest and 
most popular song in ilew York. 
Don't call me weak-minded, perchance I 
should sing, 
Of the dearest old spot upon earth; 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring, 
To my mind the dear land of my birth; 
With its hills and its valleys, its mountains and vales, 
Of which our forefathers would boast; 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ali, but list' and I'll give you an Irishman's toast. 
CHORUS: 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen, 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam, 
Through the castle that stood on the hill; 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air. 
(Chorus). 
The church and the schoolhouse have long been replaced, 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host; 
The white-haired old veteran has long been at rest, 
And his wife has deserted her post; 
King Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er the seas; 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot, 
Still this toast seems to waft to my ears on the breeze.

and sung with great success. 
Air .—Day I 
Played Base Ball 
. 
0 :— 
I 
went to the Elks' ball the other night, 
Bolavar Bill was there 
He tilled me up with rum and gum, 
I 
was drunk shure, I 
will swear. 
I 
asked a 
dame to dance with me, 
Says she ould man you're too soon, I 
see. 
No baboon will dance with me, 
At the Elks' P. B. 0. Ball, 
CHORUS. 
You are too funny, says Mr. Can, 
You remind me of my terrier black and tan 
And they wanted me to join the temperance band, 
On the night of the Elks' Annual Ball. 
I 
tried to do a 
dance alone, 
When I 
got struck with a 
brick; 
The floor manager roared cut, no buck dancing here, 
You redheaded flannel mouth mick. 
I 
said, gentlemen I 
want tG go out, 
When the gang in a 
chorus of rage did shout, 
O'Brien does your mother know you're out, 
At the Elks' P. 0. B. Annual Ball. 
They laid me down upon the floor, 
And sprinkled ray body with wax; 
And slid I 
was a 
curiosity, 
And twenty-five cents they would tax. 
They said it flew in on a 
barrel of gin, 
When a 
lady stuck in me a 
big shawl pin, 
And said she would ride the horse in the ring. 
At the Elks' 0. B. P. Annual Ball. 
BILLY'S REQUEST. 
ks sung by Mr. BILLY BIRCH for two years with tremeinloits success 
;-ive my top and string to brother, 
.11atrima, when Pm dead; 
When the sexton puts me under, 
In my little bed; 
If the job is like to throw him, 
When the string he jerks; 
Get some little boy to show him, 
how the old thing works. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Give my chewing-gum to sister, 
I 
don't want it more; 
On my gums it raised a 
blister, 
They are awful sore; 
Give away my ragged jacket, 
Mamma, don't you cry; 
In the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, 
In the sweet bye-and-bye. 
Repeat last two lines, 
Tell our neighbors that his billy goat, 
Causing all my rips; 
When he bounced me, oh, dear mother, 
I 
passed in all my chips, 
Though your son forgives him, mother, 
Give him all my wealth; 
Hit him with a 
ripe tomato, 
You know how it is yourself. 
Repeat last two lines. 
BILLY'S REQUEST— CONTINUED. 
Roll me up in nice light pie-crust, 
Slather me over with jam; 
hit me with a 
hundred cream- cakes, 
And bounce me with a 
ham; 
Take me to our old-time clam-bake, 
Shecpshead, lobster and gin; 
Drown me in a 
watermelon, 
Then wipe off my chin. 
Repeat last two lines, 
Let me bruise my little brother, 
Once before I 
go; 
Let me hit him on the smeller, 
Mamma, don't say no; 
Let me Grxco-Roman wrestle, 
I'll do my level best; 
Let me bust his new suspenders, 
Then pull down his vest. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Sprinkle me over with powdered sugar, 
Smear me over with tar; 
Spatter me over With nice duck-feathers, 
I'll be an angel, ma; 
Let me bite the old cat's tail off, 
lie can't catch no mice; 
Give me a 
dose of bitter water, 
It's naughty, but it's nice. 
Repeat last two lines.

WHEN SOME ONE PULLS THE STRING. 
As sung with great success, by BILLY M OORE 
0 :----
I 
guess you wonder who I 
am, 
And from whence and when I 
came; 
You will find I'm not Italian, 
Or a 
Chinese from Spain. 
I'm called a 
monkey jumping jack, 
They say of Ireland I 
am king; 
Let him alone, and he'll come home 
When some one pulls the string. 
CIIORUS: 
rill a 
cigar sign they'll shout at me, 
I'm a 
naughty, nasty thing; 
Let him alone, and he'll come home 
When some one pulls the string. 
I'm matched against Owney Geoghegan, 
A 
chance you don't get often 
To dance a 
jig for an eight-day pig 
Or a 
silver-plated coffin. 
We're to meet next Sunday in Hoboken, 
And his statutes he will bring; 
And I'll be there if I 
lose my hair, 
And some one pulls the string. 
(Rept-at).

CUMBERLAND'S CREW. 
Sung with great success by Devlin S: Tracy. 
Oh ! shipmates, come, gather and join in my ditty. 
It's of a 
terrible battle drat happened of late; 
Let each good Union- Tar shed a 
sad tear of pity, 
When he thinks of the once gallant Cumberland's fate. 
The eighth day of March told a 
terrible story, 
And many a 
brave tar to this world bid Adieu! 
Yet our Flag it was wrapt in a 
mantle of glory, 
By the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's crew. 
On that ill-fated day about ten in the morning, 
The sky it was clear, and bright shone the sun; 
The drums of the Cumberland sounded a 
warning 
That told every seaman to stand by his gun. 
An Iron- clad Frigate down on us came bearing, 
And high in the air the Rebel Flag flew; 
The Pennant of Treason she proudly was waving, 
Determined to conquer the Cumberland's crew. 
Then up spoke our Captain with stern resolution, 
Saying: my boys, of this monster now don't be dismayed. 
We swore to maintain our beloved Constitution, 
And to die for our country we are not afraid! 
We tight for the Union, our cause it is glorious. 
To the Stars and Stripes we will stand ever true; 
We'll sink at our quarters, or conquer victorious! 
Was answered,with cheers,from the Cumberland's erns:, 
Now our gallant ship fired her guns' dreadful thunder, 
Her broad-side, like hail, on the Rebel did pour. 
The people gazed on, struck with terror and wonder, 
T 
he shots struck her sides and glanced harmless o'er ; 
47 
CUMBERLAND'S CREW.— Continued. 
But the pride of our Navy could never be daunted, 
Tho' the dead and the wounded her deck they did strew; 
And the Flag of the Union, how proudly it flaunted, 
Sustained by the blood of the Cumberland's crew. 
Slowly they sunk beneath Virginia's waters, 
Their voices on earth will ne'er be heard more— 
They'll be wept by Columbia's brave sons and fair daughters 
May their blood be avenged on Virginia's shore !— 
In that battle stained grave they are silently lying— 
Their souls have forever to earth bid Adieu !— 
But the Star-Spangled Banner above them is flying, 
It was nailed to the mast by the Cumberland's crew. 
They fought us three hours, with stern resolution, 
Till those Rebels found cannon would never avail them -
For the Flag of Secession has no power to gall them, 
Tho' the blood from their scuppers it crimsoned the tide; 
She struck us amid- ship, our planks she did sever, 
Her sharp iron-prong pierced our noble ship through: 
And still, as they sank on that dark rolling river, 
We'll die at our guns! cried the Cumberland's crew. 
Columbia's sweet birth- right of Freedom's communion, 
Thy Flag never floated so proudly before; 
For the spirits of those that died for our Union, 
Above its broad folds now exaltingly soar !— 
And when our sailors in battle assemble, 
God bless our dear Banner: the Red, White and Blue! 
Beneath its bright Stars we'll cause tyrants to tremble, 
Or sink at our guns, like the Cumberland's crew.

MAHONEY'S FENIAN CAT. 
Written, composed and sung by GEO. W. 
CALLAHAN, the 
Ventriloquist. 
On our back fence at twelve at night 
A 
big buck cat, striped black and white, 
Meanders out to look for fight— 
Mahoney's Fenian cat. 
With an eye gouged out and ears thawed off, 
With a 
half-mast tail arid the whooping cough; 
Strange ratters thought they'd something soft 
On Mahoney's four-act cat. 
No cat or dog had pluck or gaul 
To give McGuire's pup a 
fall, 
So down he went to open the ball 
With Maloney's Thomas dog. 
Out from McGuire's alley gate 
He straightway did perambulate, 
Intending to make sausage meat 
Of Mahoney's brindle cat. 
They met upon McGuire's shed, 
With hair on end and eyeballs red, 
With yells and howls 'twould raise the dead— 
The slaughter it began. 
In half the time ye'd say begob 
The air was full of Mcatiire's dog; 
While up and down McGuire's fence, 
The picture of pure innocence, 
Mahoney's cat sas-shayed. 
Then from the roof a 
brick was fired, 
I'd take me oath it was McGuire; 
It struck the cat between the eyes, 
A.nd down he went, but he didn't rise. 
There's a 
statue where this hero lies— 
Mahoney's Fenian eat. 
Cats in Our Back Yard. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND for PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 18:Q. 
I 
live in a 
brown stone tenement, 
With green shutters painted white ; 
There's a 
family of cats lives in the rear, 
They play " Pinafore" every night. 
They sing something about Maria, 
And the times are very hard; 
Vh, they'll chew tobacco and spit in your eye, 
The cats in our back yard. 
CIIORUS. 
Tral a 
le, tral a

For the cats in our back yard. 
(Repeat.) 
They have walking matches on the fence, 
Have picnics in the cellar; 
I 
threw seventy bricks at a 
Thomas, 
You ought to hear them beller. 
They sing alto, base, and tenor, 
Oh, they ought to be feathered and tarred ! 
Oh, they are worse than Haverley's Minstrels, 
Ygs, the cats in our back yard.

OH! FRED, TELL THEM TO STOP. 
Written and composed by GEORGE M EEN. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY. 
His latest hit. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there 
To pass a 
dull hour away; 
We went in you must know, and saw Barnum's show, 
Van Amburgh's menagerie, as well; 
There were round-about swings, and all kinds of things 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
Dim,00tE.—Yes! when we got in the fair, my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride in the swing. 
I 
said, all right, my 
darling; but directly the swing went a 
little too high, sh9 
lustily cried— 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop, 
That was the cry of Maria; 
The more she said whoa, they said, let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
rue people that stood round of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said, stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in boats beside us, 
Saying, master don't do such a 
thing; 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knees; 
And one of them said, the young man's getting red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
DIALOGUE.—And Maria still cried out at the top of her 
voice— ( Chorus). 
They soon stopped the swing, Maria jumped out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
The girl I 
now do adore; 
Should you ever go there, to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing; 
Of the great round-about, it's the best fun that's out. 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
DIALoottli.—And when you take a 
girl with you, makes 
her promise she won't call out— (Chorus). 
JAMES A. GARFIELD'S GRAVE. 
Written and composed by J. W . 
KELLY, and sung by KELLY arid 
O'BniElsi, with great success. 
The steady step and muffled drum the cortege passed along, 
A 
dreadful silence reigned supreme amid the inighty thron!r; 
The somber tolling of the bells remind we must, 
in time just like our President returned from dust to dust. 
Men with heads uncovered would utter Guiteau's name, 
And the feeling of each one, I 
am certain, was the same; 
And if from jail he once was free no power on earth could 
save, 
The man that sent our President to his untimely grave. 
You saw the streets in mourning whichever way you'd go. 
And every one their sympathy in sonic way tried Co show, 
By many a 
wife and mother a 
fervent prayer was said, 
And taught it to their little ones before they went to bed. 
And when the sufferer was laid in his last resting place, 
There came an aged colored man and tears ran down his 
face; 
He brought a 
little bouquet with a 
card marked " Uncle 
Dave;" 
He plucked them wild ' twas all he had for Master Garfield's 
grave. 
How sad it was indeed to see that patient, hopeful wife, 
And gray-haired mother who for him would gladly give her 
life; 
How different were their feelings when around him they 
did stand, 
When honored with the highest place there is in our free 
land. 
Let's hope that his successor will be as fit to rule, 
And be a 
man that can't be made a 
politician's fool ; 
Then peaceful rest the ashes of a 
soldier true and brave, 
And a 
nation's tears will moist the earth on James A. 
Garfield's grave.

hear the cuckoo call, 
Oh, hear him calling nowt

Soft lilies and the rose 
Wave in the valleys green; 
Sad spirits yearn for their lost love, 
While beautiful shamrock grows. 
Oh, sadly the cuckoo is calling now,

And softly the moonbeams are falling now 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May. 
The blue birds do sing with a 
merry trill; 
Tlitir glad notes sound clear thro' the green woodlan 
bowers, 
But the cuckoo's call is so sad and still, 
It comes in the twilight's lone hours.

Wave in the valleys green; 
Sad spirits yearn for their lost love, 
While beautiful shamrock grows. 
Oh, sadly the cuckoo is calling now,

The castle clock has tolled the hour, 
The last faint gleam of parting day 
Still lights the hills and gilds the tower, 
Ere night let falls her mantle gray. 
CHORUS. 
Softly, slowly, sweetly, 
The bells are ringing 
Over the forest and lea; 
Softly, slowly, sweetly, 
Glad tones are flinging 
Far o'er the slumbering sea. 
The castle clock has tolled the hour, 
The birds fly homeward to their nest, 
And night comes on with magic power 
Hushing the world to dreamy rest.. (Chorus) 
The castle clock has tolled the hour, 
And soon again morn's rosy beam, 
Will fall on tree and dew-kissed flower, 
Waking the wood, and mount, and stream.

0, I'm something of a 
wrestler, I 
often take it in, 
Whenever there's a 
boxing match I 
ante up my tin. 
I'm something of a 
sporting man, I 
like to make a 
bet, 
I 
stand a 
chance of losing, but I 
never done it yet. 
A 
little bit of pleasantry occurred the other night, 
I 
went to see a 
wrestle and it ended in a 
fight, 
A 
Scotchman, a 
Dutchman, a 
Turk and a 
Mick, 
And poor Johnny Riley got slugged with a 
brick. 
CHORUS. 
Then nobody knows what a 
racket there was there, 
Nobody knows now, I 
tell you, I 
declare. ( Repeat chorus.) 
Now the cause of all the trouble I 
could never keep it mum, 
Somebody called Johnny McIntire a 
bum; 
Johnny got up and he stuck out his hand, 
And he swore he could lick any cripple in the land. 
Big John Monohan was standing by the door, 
He caught a 
hold of McIntire, and threw him on the floor

Oh, I 
love a 
darling, a 
Thompson Street wench, 
The Diggers all say she's insane; 
She fell off the tail of the comet last spring, 
And the fall may have injured her brain. 
You bet she's a 
masher, this Thompson Street belle 
And with her left hoof I 
often was riz ; 
The darkies eat onions to make them shed tears, 
'Cause they can't mash my Liver-lip Liz.

Liz, Liz, Liv.r-lip Liz, 
She's ugly and lazy, bow-legged and crazy, 
But Liz, Liz, she knows her biz, 
None can scoop in a

She has hands like two tug-boats, her feet would make 
yards, 
Her eyes are like turnips well stewed; 
When she gets on her ear she'll kick off your mus• 
But you must not think that she's rude; 
Her ears would make tasters, she has a 
month like a

Oh, she is such a 
terrible quiz; 
I

grave, 
When I

THE IRISH BRIGADE, 
Written, composed and sung with great success, hy H ARRY -
W HALING, at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Now don't be alarmed, friends, at seeing me here, 
I'm a 
gem of the very first water; 
My appearance will show I'm a 
gentleman, too, 
I'm a 
son of a 
Marquis's daughter; 
[3:' Mother, God bless her! she doted on me, 
Said of danger I 
ne'er was afraid; 
tSo when I 
grew to manh000d, a 
commission I 
bought, 
And I'm one of the Irish Brigade. 
4:orus—Then hurrah, hurrah, for the true sons of Erin, 
The stout-hearted soldiers are never afraid; 
They're true to the core, and in death ever daring, 
I'm Colonel Shea of the Irish Brigade. 
The Irish Brigade is a 
corps true and brave, 
And for fighting, the best in the land; 
In peace they're true-hearted, cheerful and gay, 
While in battle like lions will stand; 
And I 
am their leader, and proud to say, 
My soldiers all dote upon me; 
For oft midst the roar of the cannon they shout, 
"Give a 
cheer, boys, for brave Colonel Shea,"— Choru& 
ro the roll of the drum they march gaily on, 
Through the fields, midst the dead and the dying; 
And high in the air, through the smoke can be seen, 
The Green Flag nobly flying; 
And there it waves proudly, amid shot and shell, 
While my men to the charge they are led. 
And they'll fight till they die, ere an inch they will fly, 
In defence of the flag o'er their head. 
Chorus. 
Then boys, give a 
cheer for the sons of our Isle, 
In gallantry, none them excel; 
For their rights and their country they've oft led the way 
And like soldiers have nobly fell; 
Theg.'ve fought and they've conquered their foes o'er and 
o'er, 
in foreign lands over the sea; 
And they'd try hard again, would my stout-hearted men 
If called on by brave Colonel Shea. 
Chorus, 
60; 
Charming Little Lu. 
INSTRUCTIVE AND INTERESTING. 
Sung only as a 
Song and Dance by FANNIE BEANE. 
'Twos at a 
fancy ball at St. James' Hall, 
With the prettiest fellow in the nation, 
I 
at once did go, thinking there to show 
My dancing skill, and gain his approbation, 
But, strange to say, I 
dared not dance, 
Nor could I 
leave my seat, 
Though poor dear Gussy came to me, 
And thus he did entreat: 
CHORUS. 
Charming little Lu, may I 
dance with you, 
In the mazy polka and the lanciers ? 
Charming little Lu, may I 
dance with you, 
And mingle with the merry, merry dancers ? 
When we left the hall, I 
then told him all 
Of my sad determination, 
And, like all the rest, I 
did try my best 
To keep down all his rash indignation. 
My hair-pins gone, my braids were loose, 
To dance I 
did not dare ; 
My chignon surely would come off, 
And make the people stare. 
SPOKEN.-Of course when I 
informed Gussy, dear, that I 
was liable to lose all my back hair if I 
danced, he could not 
do otherwise than say— 
Clever little Lu, that was brave of you, 
Not to dance the polka or the lancers, &c.

method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have

C01111iing Cardti.—Tltis Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressine one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal.. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. Tnis pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be. 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un• 
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but, may be enjoyed by evening parties

A 
Little Book lias lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, No. 21 
Vesey Street, called the " Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would 
only enc,ourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunatly, there is 
enough of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, 
when and where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening' Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book, bound in 7Morrocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt." published by A. J. FISHER, No. 24 Vesey Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents- might 
afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
