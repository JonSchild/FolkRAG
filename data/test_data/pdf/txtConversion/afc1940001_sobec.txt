In came the shad-bellied Yankee out of breath, And he says, "Old-feller, goll-darn-ye!" Then along
came Pike, saying, "I'll be the death Of you bank robbers, dog-on-ye!" Chorus. [md] So be careful
all you rowdies, &c. I. C. Woods sabed something very strange, So he vamosed, though he knew it
wouldn't sound well. He hid among the bills in the Contra Costa range, With a bag of bogus dust
[md] what a scoundrel! Chorus. [md] So be careful all you rowdies, &c. Ladies in the jam now and
then were heard to say, "Oh, Lordy-massy, how you squeeze us!" When a Jew got to to the counter,
he began without delay, "Vell; I vants my money, by [Skeesus?] [Seesus?] !' Chorus. [md] So be careful
all you rowdies, &c. Frenchmen they were squalking like a flock of hungry geese; Vainly did they
parley-voo-de-ding-dong. Sauer-Kraut was looking for a justice of the Peace, To send all the Yankee
thieves to Hong Kong. Chorus. [md] go be careful all you rowdies, &c. Adams he declared that his
name was just a sale, To give "The House" a wholesome reputation; I. C. Woods says they both
agreed to fail, And swindle all o' God's creation. Chorus. [md] - So be careful all you rowdies, &c. The
bank robber Woods had to hunt another hole, For many were determined they would kill him; So he
gathered up the money he maliciously had stole, And away went the black hearted villain. Chorus.
[md] So be careful all you rowdies, &c. Their "Receiver" is a thief [md] you can see it by his looks [md]
And the Lord knows what he wouldn't swear to; After fobbing all the money, why he then stole the
books, And a thousand other things that would scare you. 3 3 of 3

Chorus. [md] So be careful all you rowdies, &c. They were thrown into the bay 'bout the middle of
the night, By the long-eared, fish-faced Cohen; And the moment they were found he was quickly out
of sight, For he thought it was time to be goin'. Chorus. [md] So be careful all you rowdies, &c. Page
& Bacon, after Adams, thought they'd make a strike, Concluded in a hurry they would try it, Pocket
what they could, go a-kiteing back to Pike [md] Now I wonder if they ever will deny it. Chorus. [md]
So be careful all you rowdies, &c. Like a great many others, they were taken by surprise, When they
come to overhaul their plunder; Instead of a half a million they were sure to realize, They hadn't stole
a dollar, by thunder! Chorus. [md] So be careful all you rowdies, &c. They were bound to make a
raise, so they started in again, And carried on a wholesale thieving, Robbed the orphan, the widow,

the farmer of his grain And were taken with [md] a very sudden leaving! Chorus. [md] So be careful
all you rowdies, &c. If the English and French cannot take Sebastopol, They had better let the job to
the Yankees; Uncle Sam will do it cheap, unless he is a fool, [md] He could steal it with the California
bankers! Chorus. [md] So be careful all you rowdies, &c.
