coUraged by the sympathy of our audiences 
in all sections where we haVe had the honor 
to perform, we have essayed the managerial 
duties of the Theatre Comique. 
It shall be our aim in our new role, 
as it_ has always been in our personal efforts, 
to fa
urnith amusements worthy of the intel-
ligent and generous support, with which 
you have so kindly favored us; eschewing 
every tendency, either in tvord or action,

nance with parlor entertainmentS. 
Included within these pages, will be found 
a 
number of new compositions, to which we 
invite your attention, believing from the 
spontaneous enthusiasm with which they 
are nightly received, that they will be wel-
comed by all lovers of song.

THE STARS OF THE PERIOD 
Dedicated to Harrigan and Hart 
By EDWARD AUSTIN. 
Hasten for seats, do not delay, 
Great artists are in town to-day: 
And high upon the roll of fame, 
Resplendent shines their well-known name! 
Refinement's air pervades their acts, 
And what they do no neatness lacks; 
Reputation great they've earned and made, 
No one throws them in the shade! 
In their great act, " Slavery Days," 
Deaf 
fling applause they're sure to raise. 
Go and see the " Blue and Gray," 
Clasping hands in bright array; 
And " The Sixty Ninth" (the " gallant,") 
Observe the boys pDssess men's talent. 
Nature, Harrigan has surely blest, 
Made him " different from the rest," 
And by his own majestic sway, 
Banish, he will, all care away. 
Next comes Tony, who sings so well, 
In dancing none can him excel; 
Devoid of all that's stale or low, 
No rival does this artist know. 
Homage should to both be paid 
Astonishing is 
The Day Parade ;" 
And other sketches they will do 
That are to life and nature true. 
Remember, the music of excellent worth 
In the mind of Braham had its birth 
Then the manager of this great team— 
Obliging Hanley—deserves esteem ! 
SivrisFAcTroN, great, is given to all— 
Now don't forget this night to call.

DANCING IN 'ME BALLET, 
Written and sung by En. H ARRIGAN. 
I 
was once the queen of the ballet so gay, 
The greatest artist ever seen on the stage; 
In the art Terpsichore, a 
sweet beauty in fact, 
I 
set the whole town in a 
rage. 
Xngaged by Jarrett and Palmer each week, 
To do the solos in the Crook; 
I 
would fascinate your dears, 
With my loving, languishing look. 
CHORUS. 
Dancing in the ballet, 
The beautiful Parisian ballet, 
I 
was the queen, La belle Pauline, 
Dancing in the ballet. 
My name on the bills was Silvina Malki, 
My real name was Johannah McGee; 
So fluent I 
speak the French language, oh 
That's warbled in Tip- per- rare- e. 
The young men would call me a 
dazzler so sweet, 
Delightful, entrancing they'd say, 
Sow I'm forced to make shirts for the supers I 
meet, 
Oonsidered by all en passe. 
Pancing in the ballet, &Q. 
I 
was so bewitchingly, graceful and neat, 
in slow movements my .overs, sts there I 
excelt, 
Mountains of bouquets and flowers so sweet, 
*as thrown to this pretty gazelle. 
The young girls would say, what a 
beauty and sigh, 
As around on my toes I 
would spin; 
Ip the back line of ballet, I'll stop till I 
die, 
Because I'm so dreadfully thin. 
Dancing in the ballet, & c. 
When standing amidst the corypitees there, 
I 
make such a 
sweet-looking fairy-like queen • 
Could stand on the end of a 
needle, 
And turn or float in cloud in the air. 
My dresses were made and brought out from Paris, 
Most gorgeously trimmed round with gold: 
Now I'm in the back line of the ballet, 
Simply because I 
am old.

But oh! the gawk- eyed, blue wash cur, 
His scalp I'd like to pull,

I'd carve old sitting bull. 
Out country lost a 
patriot, 
Brave Custer We will moan, 
His memory will live forever green, 
When you and I 
are gone. 
He fought against overwhelming odds, 
Laid iiiariy an Indian low. 
And when brave Custer met his death, 
Our country met a 
blow.

But Oh, did rd4kin inkin ens; 
We're bound to take his wool, 
And to avenge gallant Custer's death, 
We'll Scalp old Sitting Bull.

I 
lived in Brooklyn, on the Heights— 
I 
often cross the ferry 
To Catharine street, where I 
usually meet 
Me second cousin Jerry. 
It was last night I 
got so tight— 
The divil a

At Maloney's bar were beer and cigars— 
I'm all broke up to-day.

To draw me up a

I'm not intoxicated, 
But slightly elevated; 
With joy I'm overheated— 
I'm all broke up to-day. 
Prom Maloney's we went to Casey's— 
It was after twelve o'clock! 
We eat hot clams and fry's of lambs— 
Three barrels of saddle rocks ! 
Men from Tyrol and sweet Athlone. 
Across the Atlantic Sea. 
Had arguments—of conequence

I 
had an altercation 
With Maloney's brother Jack; 
We rassell'd round the barrels— 
I

Then the whole of Maloney's family 
Convey'd me to a

tnd took me to a 
Calaboose!

The pledge I'm going to sign; 
Drink Ginger A.le, and Double X 
Pale, 
And French Canandago wine.

Drink sure, long, Coffee and Tea!

Without the use of candle or of light.

Who never cared for gold, 
He's sleeping in de cemetary in de grave.

noble soldier, 
You'll see before I'm done, 
De picture of de greatest man— 
Geor7 General Washington.

Mit his sword all in his hand, 
By his soldiers he vould stand, 
By Waterloo dey say dat man is dead; 
. - 
By de hearts of his people, 
We never will go out, 
Dat's what history will tell you all to day; 
Give three cheers for dat man. 
Let all de people shout—

HARRIGAN'S DREAM, 
Dedicatvd to Messrs. HARRIGAN 
BY HOBERrr M CKAY. 
The " Mulligan Guard" turned out in force 
In the " Patrick's- day Parade ;" 
The " Skidmores," too, were also there— 
A 
fine display they made. 
It was remarked by every one, 
As they " Down Broadway" did go. 
There were no finer men in all 
The " Regular Army, Oh." 
CHORUS. 
'With banners flying, music play-'ng 
Opera airs from Avenue A ; 
Proud steeds prancing, bright eyes glancing, 
So they marched away. 
" 
The Ould Hat," blocked for fifty cents, 
Again gleamed 'mid the throng, 
And " McNamara," proud's a 
lord, 
Beneath it marched along ; 
He heeded not the naughty boys ; 
But, from a 
well-filled can, 
Drank frequent healths to Ireland, with 
" 
Muldoon, the Solid Man." 
Cnorws. 
With banners flying, music playing 
Opera airs from Avenue A ; 
Proud steeds prancing, bright eyes glancing, 
So they marched away. 
25 
Next came " The Gallant Sixty- Ninth" 
Sweet Kitty O'Neil, of course, 
Was there, and looked perfection, on 
A 
cream-complexioned horse; 
And oh, what shouts and joyful cries 
Were heard along the street, 
When, recognized by every one, 
Passed by " Old Uncle Pete." 
CHORUS. 
With banners flying, music playing 
Opera airs from Avenue A; 
Proud steeds prancing, bright eyes glancing 
So they marched away. 
And then the seedy `• Scandal Club," 
The gawks, devoid of guile ; 
Passed by then the " N. E. F. C.' . 
In " Rale McMullin Style. 
And so they went : but then, of course, 
I 
don't intend to name 
The half of them, for I 
awoke 
And found—'twas all a 
dream 
Cnows. 
With banners flying, music playing 
Opera airs from Avenue A; 
Proud steeds prancing, bright eyes glancing, 
So they marched away.

Olt its lately I've missed her, 
Shure I 
mane me sister; 
She's strong as a 
bull, 
And she strikes 3, hard blow. 
Her cheeks they are rosey, 
And nate as the posey; 
At the big Castle Garden 
She landed below. 
CHORUS. 
Oh say, have you seen her, 
To you I'd describe her,— 
She wears a 
red petticoat, 
And a 
hat on her head; 
She moves whin she's walking, 
She spakes whin she's talking; 
An' her petticoat is marked 
0, P, Q, X, Y, R, Z. 
She comes out wid my cousins,

count them by the dozens; 
I'm forced for to think 
They have led her astray. 
For some information 
rd suffer starvation f. 
Swear off against whigkey, 
Drink nothing but tay. 
On her cheek there's a 
dimple, 
On her nose there's a 
pimple: 
Her fut's very small— 
Sure she wears No. 10. 
She was the lady 
That fought Mrs. Brady, 
At home in Mayo 
She could whip all the men. 
She'd sing like a 
fairy. 
Or any canary, 
She never was standing 
Whinever she set. 
Like old Neptune's daughter, 
She'd fall in the water, 
She'd come out like a 
herring, 
She'd Dever get wet. 
She was sober when drinking, 
When aslape she was thinking • 
She was:delicate and soft 
As the wild Duffalo. 
She'd a 
hand like a 
sailor 
On ooard of a 
whaler; 
Her name is McSwegan, 
From the county Illayo. 
Oh say, •tc 
Oh say, Ice.

McMullin is my name, without any fear or shame. 
I'd stand out here forninst yon in the rale McMullin style„ 
My father often tould me to never tell a

Be free and independent as a

Let my lie_irt be like a

For I

Mr. Shakespere's brain said there's nothing in a 
name, 
But be was a 
total stranger to McMullin all the while, 
For if he'd lived to-day, one thing he'd surely say, 
There's nothing can compare, my boys, to rale McMullin style. 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, etc. 
My father's blood is in lay veins, and 
cMullin is my name, 
It's known from Ireland unto the river Nile, 
And when you have bad luck, don't cry out like a

The Controlling Influence of Drink. 
A Hiunorona Recitation by ED. HARRIGAN. 
IN a 
tenement brick, 
Where the families were thick. 
Lived McMullen, a 
poor little tailor, 
Although he was small 
At a 
party or a 
ball, 
He was nimble and light as a 
sailor. 
As a 
man, he was quiet. 
Kept out of a 
riot, 
His nose was red as a 
pink, 
And when he got full, 
lie was like a 
mad bull, 
From the controlling influence of hrmk. 
Whin the war begun 
lie followed the drum, 
In the Sixty-ninth Regiment, a 
soldier, 
Be went to the front 
The rebels to hunt, 
The devil a 
troop more bolder. 
When he marched in the fight 
McMullen was tight, 
He never took time to think--
He was shot in the head 
And left there for dead, 
From the controlling influence of drink. 
McMullen had pluck, 
That's no use without luck, 
And whin they sent him to cook for the nagen, 
His spirit arose, 
He put his thumb to his nose 
Saying I'd see you in h-11 first, be jabers. 
In a 
cell he was put 
Twenty-two pounds to the link- --
Whin they let him go 
Ohl his health was so low 
From the controlling influence of drink, 
Whin McMullen got home 
He was all skin and bone. 
'Pon me sowlthe poor little fellow was a 
failing. 
The doctor came in and says he 
Give him plenty of gin, 
For that's where the tailor is ailing. 
lie swallowed a 
quart— 
His life was beginning to sink, 
More gin thin lie cried, 
Rolled over and died 
From the controlling influence of drink-
Ohl the liquor and cake 
That rolled in at the wake, 
'Twould fill up a 
confectionarg. 
The neighbors kim in 
To take the last look at him, 
Who'd a 
smile on his face like a 
fairy 
Wid sobs and wid sighs 
And tears in their eyes, 
They gave one another the wink, 
And slobbering, said 
I'm tould that he's dead, 
From the controlling influence of drink. 
There's a 
nate little spot 
Beyant in a 
Calvary lot, 
Where the poor little tailor was buried 
And carriages tine 
And sojers in line, 
In a 
boat cross the river was ferried. 
They stood round the grave, 
And many's the sigh they gave 
As the dirt was shoveled up to the brink 
And on the tombstone 
Was died alone 
From the controlling influence of drink.

MURPHY'S LITTLE BAOK ROOM; 
Original by ED. HanarsA.N. 
Air: Pat. Roach. 
DID you ever hear telt of Ted Murphy, 
He came from the County Mayo, 
He kept a 
bar-room in this city, 
In a 
democratic ward here below. 
His distillery was over in Brooklyn, 
In a 
place that they call Irishtown, 
You'd get a 
bucket of ale for five cents, 
He'd trust whin you'd put money down. 
( 
t. 
Success to my friend, Teddy Murphy, 
He often gave me two for one, 
I've played forty-fives at his table, 
Drank his whisky his beer and rum. 
I've counted the cracks in the ceiling, 
Swept the sand ofl the flure wid a 
broom, 
I've rallied for many a. turkey, 
In Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was laborers, canallers, and ria•crers, 
Who worked on the docks very hard, 
Shovelmen, pipemen, and drivers, 
Who worked on the big Boulevard. 
On Saturday nights they assembled, 
Wid a 
fiddler tulay up a 
time, 
And they danced till the break in the morning, 
In Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was a 
Dutchman kept over opposite, 
Who was jealous of Ted's rushing trade, 
He put up a 
job one fine evening, 
For the police to go make a 
raid 
On the liquors, barrels and glasses, 
In the bar-room Nvid their clubs they wint, 
And poor Teddy without provocation, 
To the Island for 10 days was sint. 
Poor Teddy he lost his influence, 
In the courts and the grand committee, 
lie sarved his full time in the prison, 
Praying each day to get free. 
He took spunk and jumped in the river, 
To swim to the Long Island shore, 
He got a 
cramp in his leg and his stomach, 
Be sank to rise up no more,

THERE'S a 
bit of clay on a 
little stint, 
That's sweet enough to ate, 
Whin nlled up wid tobacco 
'Twould put a 
man to sive. 
'Twas introduced in Ireland 
In the days of Brian Borhue. 
I'd rather lose my life, my boys, 
Than lose my honey-dew. 
Some call it Cavendish, 
Or any name you'd wish. 
And they dale it out in plug, you know. 
When it is fresh and green, 
When from my work I 
tire, 
I 
set down by the lire, 
An' I 
watch the smoke roll up and curl, 
From my little ould Duddeen. • 
CEIORUS. 
My duddeen you are so sweet to me, 
I 
love to see your smoke go up 
Whin I 
get through my tea. 
My duddeen, you are in the family, 
I'd surely die if I 
found out 
You were stole away from me. 
If ye have studied history, 
Yell read where William Ping 
'V 
Bought the state of Pinnsylvania 
From the wild red Injin men, 
He never used 
sword or gun 
When he met them face to face, 
But they all si I 
down continted, 
And they smoked the pipe of peace. 
If ye'd only take a 
puff, 
Shure one would be enough 
To put you in a 
slumber, 
A 
stupor, or a 
dream. 
Ye might say it's not ginteel, 
But so beautiful I 
feel 
Whin I 
sit down in the corner, boys, 
Wid my little ould Duddeen. 
My Duddeen, 
A 
Frenchman smokes the little thing 
They call the cigarette, 
it makes him feel uneasy, 
As he blows, and puffs, and frets. 
The Chinese smokes the opium, 
'Till it puts him in a 
doze. 
And the Yankee smokes the bad cigar, 
Wid one end to his nose. 
But every Irishman— 
Bould Patsey, Mike or Dan, 
That was born in dear old Ireland, 
Where the grasses grow so green, 
If they've no coat to their back, 
They've that bit of clay so black; 
it's a 
consolation to them, 
Is the little old Duddeen. 
My Duddeen,

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We ha-ye 
published it for years. and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arr , nged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
enclosed in handsome case 
Price 25 Cents. 
Courting Cards.-- This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are 'Visited by gentlemen who are either too difil. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse. to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will "over every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

Read what two 
leading New York papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Nail writes ., 
64 A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Please's, 99 Nas-
sau street ca led the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaioing " how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We haoe lately seen 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing 'twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. Fisrmn, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do net hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers." 
Elegantly bound in cloth, gilt 
Price 25 Cents.

abided by, or been ruled by the answers of this Oracle. No further lib-
erties have been taken in ihe translation, than merely to adapt it to the 
usages of this country.
