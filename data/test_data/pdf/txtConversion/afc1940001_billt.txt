This evening Rogers read a chapter in the Bible, as well as anexcellent tract, to which great attention
was paid by all, even someupper cabin passengers, except Messrs. Marvin, Paine, H. and Mrs. H.But
I am glad to say that they are the only persons who thus break inupon and transgress all moral as
well as divine law. They were evenboisterous enough to interfere with the reading. Last evening
songswere sung, among others "Billy Taylor." We had fiddling and later inthe night the "owlers"
commenced operations and had a merry spree,keeping up their noisy revels until two o'clock this
morning. TextChristman, Florency Morrow, comp. & ed.One Man's Gold, page 37, 38(The Letters and

Billy Taylor Billy Taylor was a brisk young fellow,Full of fun, and full of glee,And his mind he did
discoverTo a lady fair and free.Four and twenty brisk young fellowsDrest they were in rich arrayAnd
they took poor Billy Taylor,Whom they press'd and sent to sea.And his truelove follow'd afterUnder
the name of Richard Car,Her lily-white hands were bedaub'd all overWith the nasty pitch and tar.Now
behold, the first engagementBold she fought among the restTill the wind did blow her jacketAnd
discover her lily-white breastWhen that the captain came for to view itSays he, "What wind has
blown you here?""Sir? I become to seek my trueloveWhom you press'd I love so dear.""If you be
come to seek your treasureTell to me his name, I pray.""Sir, his name is Billy TaylorWhom you
press'd and sent to sea.""If his name is Billy Taylor,He is both cruel and severe,For rise up early in
the morningAnd you'll see him with his lady fair."With that she rose up early next morning,Early by
the break of day,And there she saw bold Billy TaylorDancing with his lady gay.With that she called
for sword and pistol,Which did come at her command,And there she shoot bold Billy TaylorWith his
truelove in his hand.When that the captain came for to know itHe very much applauded her for what
she had done,And immediately made her the first lieutenantOf the glorious Thunder Bumb.
