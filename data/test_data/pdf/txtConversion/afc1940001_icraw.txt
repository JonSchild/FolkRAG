"I crawled out and started on,And managed very well,Until I struck the HumboldtWhich I thought
was nearly Hell.I traveled till I struck the Sink,Where outlet can't be found;The Lord got through
late Saturday night [md] He'd finished all around,But would not work on Sunday,So he run it in the
ground."
