The Organ-Grinder. 
Sung by Btsuor BUCKLEY. 
Words by G. IV HUNT. 
You see before you a 
young man 
Who mourns both night and day 
For the loss of a 
pretty girl named Fan 
Who has stolen my heart away. 
She said she loved me faithfully, 
And vowed we nc'er should part ; 
But she's gone away with an organ-man, 
And broken my poor heart — heart — heart. 
CHORUS — So I 
mourn the loss of the girl I 
love, 
And I 
don't know where to find her; 
She's gone away from her turtle-dove 
With a 
nasty organ-grinder. 
At a 
twelve-roomed house in Pemberton Square 
• She lived as kitchen-maid ; 
Two dollars a 
week and all she could find 
Was the salary she got paid. 
Oh! how often down those area steps 
I've crept like an old tomcat, 
And after having a 
good blow-out, 
I've filled my poor old hat — hat— hat. 
CHORUS 
So I 
mourn the loss of the girl I 
love, etc. 
Out of all the servants in the square 
She used to take the shine ; 
She'd a 
delicate turn to her ankle, 
And a 
great big crinoline. 
When she used to clean the front-door steps, 
how the chaps they used to stare, 
• 
And throw sheep's eyes and heave big sighs, 
Which made me tear my hair — hair — hair. 
CHORUS 
So I 
mourn the loss of the girl I 
love, etc. 
Now one day Fan asked the orgall-man 
To play her " Uncle Sam ; " 
She gave him coppers in return, 
And a 
plate of cold roast lamb. 
Then he told her he was of noble blood, 
And would be a 
marquis one fine day ; 
In fact, he told such thundering lies 
That with hiaishe eloped away — that day. 
CHORES — So I 
mourn the loss of the girl I 
love, etc. 
Well, the last I 
heard of the happy pair 
7was down in Pimlico. 
The fellow was grinding on his instrument of torturo 
And she played the " old banjo." 
Bqt to mourn any more for a 
girl like that 
I 
should only be a 
dunce ; 
So I'll think no more of Fan and her organ-man, 
But hope they'll get six months. 
CHORUS— So no more I'll mourn for the girl I 
loved, 
And no more Hi try to find her; 
She may go and be bluwed for what I 
care, — 
Yes, and so may her organ-grinder. 
I 
see a 
bill's been introduced 
By an M. P. In Bass, • 
To do away with organ-men 
And all of that " ' ere class.' 
But your applause is the music I 
like, 
And such friends who could resist them ; 
But though 1 
long to sing another song, 
It wouldn't suit my organ-ic system. 
CHORUS — The spirit's willing, but the flesh is weak; 
You'll please to excuse the remainder ; 
But if you'll come another night, 
I'll sing the " organ-grinder."

The Hardware Line. 
v4 
Sung by Brsnor BUCKLEY. Words by H. CLIFTON. 
YES, my old dad was a 
money-making notary, 
And sipping his wine has often told 
That woman was a 
riddle and marriage a 
lottery, 
▪ 
And wives at the altar were bought and sold. 
• His reason for this I 
cannot divine, 
For it was not the case with the wife of mine ; 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother and a 
sister and a 
brother, 
And they all got a 
living in the hardware line. 
CHORES — She'd a 
father, etc. 
The words that he uttered caused quite a 
panic 
In my youthful mind ; so I 
soon did decide 
To cut broadcloth, and in the garb of a 
mechanic 
From the unwashed multitude to seek a 
bride. 
'Twos there I 
found this wife of mine ; 
Then I 
laid my heart on Cupid's shrine. 
CHORES — She'd a 
father, etc. 
Every town and village I 
did rummage 'em 
England, Ireland, and Scotland through 
Till at last I 
came to the good old town of Bummagem, 
A 
second edition of the wandering Jew. 
'Twos there I 
lost this heart of mine 
To one of the gender femer-nine. 
CHORUS — She'd a 
father, etc. 
Her brother was a 
gunsmith, her sister was a 
burnisher, 
Her mother made buttons at three cents a 
gross, 
Her father, he plated harness furniture, 
She kept the books of profit and loss. 
Three months for her did I 
waste and pine 
Before I 
asked her to resign. 
CHORUS— She'd a 
father, etc. 
She's a 
first-rate hand at a 
brewing or a 
baking; 
She can knit silk purses or make mince-pies;

DUCRLEYS' SONGS . 
Her bonnets and her dresses are all her own making; 
Her home-made bread takes all by surprise. 
Champagne or claret, from the banks of the Rhine, 
Can't be compared to her gooseberry wine. 
CHORUS —  
SlIC•d a 
father, etc. 
My days they pass in one round of pleasure. 
I 
feel as if I 
should ue'er grow old ; 
For a 
wife that is good is a 
priceless treasure, 
And more to a 
man than silver and gold. 
Far better than a 
useless lady fine, 
Is this busy, merry, cheerful little wife of mine. 
CHORUS —  
She'd a 
father, etc. 
On Board of the Kangaroo. 
Sung by BISIIOP BUCKLEY. Words by I
I. CLIFTON. 
ONCE I was a 
waterman, and lived at home in ease ; 
Now I'am a 
mariner and plough the angry seas. 
I 
thought I'd like seafaring life, so bade my love adieu, 
And shipped as cook and steward boy on board the Kan-
garoo. 
CHORUS — I 
never thought she would be false, or ever 
prove untrue, 
When we sailed away from Milford Bay, on board the 
Kangaroo. 
My love she was no foolish girl; her age it was twoscore; 
My love was not a 
spinster; she'd been married twice be-
fore; 
And they could not say it was her wealth that stole my 
heart away. 
She was starcher at a 
laundress's, at eighteen pence a 
day. 
Cum's — I 
never thought she would be false, etc. 
" 
Oh, think of me, oh, think of me," she mournfully did 
say, 
" 
When you are in a 
foreign land, carousing far away.

And take this lucky three-cent bit; ' twill make you bear 
in mind 
The loving, faithful, trusting heart you leave in tears be-
hind." 
CHORUS- I 
never thought she would be false, etc. 
" 
Cheer up, cheer up, my own true love; don't weep so 
bitterly 
But she sobbed and sighed and choked and cried, and 
couldn't say good- by. 
" 
I 
sha'n't be gone so very long, — only months a 
few; 
And when I 
does come back again, in course I'll marry 
you." 
CHORUS —  I 
never thought she would be false, etc. 
Our vessel it was homeward bound from many a 
foreign 
shore, 
And many a 
foreign present unto my love I 
bore. 
There was tortoises from Teneriffe and toys from Timbuc-
too, 
A 
Chinese rat and a 
Bengal cat and a 
Bombay cock-a-too. 
Clloaus — I 
never thought she would be false, etc. 
Paid off, I 
sought her dwelling in the suburbs of the town. 
A 
haneient dame upon a 
line was hanging out a 
gown. 
" 
Where is my love?" " She's married sir, about six 
months ago, 
To a 
smart young man who drives a 
van for Chaplin, home, 
& 
Co." 
Omit:us — I 
never thought she would be false, etc. 
Farewell to dreams of married life, to soaps, to suds and 
blue, 
To Clenfield starch, and" Harpers twelvetrees " washing-
powder too. 
I'll seek some far and distant clime; I 
can no longer stay; 
And on some Chinese Hottentot, I'll throw myself away. 
CIIORITS — I 
never thought she would be false, etc 
Sung by BISHOP BUCKLEY. Words by THOMAS A. 
BECKET. 
On ! when I 
was a 
pickaninny no higher than this box, 
My mamma used to call me sweet, and pat my curly locks. 
I 
used to dance before the door upon the grass so green, 
The loveliest little nigger boy that ever could be seen. 
CHORUS— But now the ease am altered, and everybody say, 
" 
You pig-headed, big- headed, wig-headed nigger, 
You nigger, get out of the way." 
I 
courted lovely Dinah when I 
was seventeen ; 
Her mouth was wide, she'd rolling eyes, and a 
lovely nose 
between. 
She used to play wid my silken locks, and patted them so 
- oft 
Dat she knocked the wool off the top of my head, and now 
the place am soft. 
CHORUS - But now the case, etc. 
But after I 
got married, my Dinah proved a 
shrew, 
And then she patted me on the head wid de heel of her 
old shoe. 
She knocked the wool all off my head as you may under-
stand ; 
Just look, its as smooth as a 
pumpkin rind, and as bare 
as the palm of my hand. 
CHORUS — But now the case, etc. 
Sung by R. BISHOP BUCKLEY. Words by HARRY CLIFTON. 
DOWN by the country-side 
Lives old Grey, the miller; 
Down by the side of the millstream tide 
Grows a 
weepin' wilier. 
Under the wilier tree sat the miller's daughter, 
Singing a 
song and gazing long 
Into the bubblin' water ( liquid). 
Cnoans — She sat by the side of the bubblin' water, 
Under the weepin' wilier tree. 
Tears fell from lior oyes, 
iier hands she was a-wringin'. 
First she sighs, and then she cries, 
And then commences singin', 
" 
All the world's a 
waste ; life to me is ojeus, 
Since William he deserted me. 
A.nd went and joined the sojers (army)." 
Cnonus — She sat by the side of the bubblin' water, etc. 
Then from her buzum she drew 
A 
piece of needle- cover; 
On it she wrote a 
very short note 
To her deceitful lover. 
6 
4 Take this to William Phipps; straight to him be telling 
His Susan died through suicide. 
P. S. Excuse bad spelling (orthography)." 
CHORUS - She sat by the side of the bubblin' water, etc. 
She looked at the thimble- case 
Which William false had bought her, 
- 
First to the right and then to the left 
And then looked into the water. 
Then she did prepare her mortal life to injure. 
Iler bead was bare, and the color of her hair 
Was a 
sort of a 
delicate ginger ( auburn). 
Cuoaus— She sat by the side of the bubblin' water, etc. 
She looked at the water above, 
And said, " I'll hang my garter; 
But what a 
mistake, if my garter break-, 
I 
shall be drowned in the water." 
She looked at the water below, and her nerves began to 
totter,

BURLEYS' SONGS . 
" 
I'm not very hold, and I 
may take cold, 
I'll wait till the weather is hotter ( milder)." 
Cuonts — She sat by the side of the bubblin' water, etc. 
She rose and dried her tears, 
And said, " Since he's a 
rover, 
I 
will not mind, but try and find 
Sonic more faithful lover. 
If one I 
cannot find, to me it's very funny. 
As love is blind, I'm half inclined 
To marry a 
man for money ( rhino)." 
CHOKES — She sat by the side of the bubblin' water, etc.

Nor, think the time a

But always straight across.

CHORUS — Oh, she was a 
perfect screamer! 
Oh, how much I 
did esteem her ! 
Oh, how I 
wish I'd never seen her! 
She had such wheedling ways. 
She walked with ease and dignity, and proud, too, was 
her mein ; 
She wore a 
long and sweeping skirt with capacious crino-
line. 
A Paisley shawl her shoulders graced, on her head ono 
of those dears 
Of bonnets, perched up high in the front and pinched in 
at the ears. 
CHORUS — Oh, she was a 
perfect screamer! etc. 
I 
followed her until she stopped, a 
picture-shop to view, 
When a 
feeling strange came over me, that I 
must stop 
there too, • 
The space between us, wide at first, grew narrow by do-
grees, 
Until I 
felt a 
sharp steel hoop sensation at my knees. 
CHORES — Oh, she was a 
perfect screamer! etc. 
With what peculiar incidents the life of man is fraught! 
By some mishap, the fringe around her shawl a 
button 
caught. 
She, blushing, begged my pardon, then some wicked looks 
despa 
And jokingly observed, " How very soon we are at-

CHORUS — Oh, she was a 
perfect screamer! etc. 
In conversation walking on, to kind inquiries made, 
She said, " I

I 
now am acting feeder to an envelope machine."

BEHOLD a 
poor deluded man, 
A 
victim to deception; 
Forget my woes I 
never can, 
And .' 
wander in dejection. 
I 
married once a 
nice young girl; 
I'll ne'er forget the morn, 
For ever since, how oft I've wished 
That I 
had ne'er been born. 
CHORUS — I 
loved her, and she might have been 
The happiest in the land ; 
But she thncied a 
fireicrner, who played the flageolet 
In the middle of a 
German band. 
She was all my fancy painted her, — 
Her name was sweet Susannah. 
She could sing, she could dance, she could parley VOUS 
France, 
And could play upon the grand pianner.

What a 
blissful honeymoon we spent! 
To her none could have been kinder ; 
For I 
made the bed and black-leaded the stove, 
While she played the " organ-grinder." 
Cuortus— I 
loved her, and she might have been, etc. 
She'd play all the day, whilst I 
was away, 
A-slaving for the cash in the city ; 
And if any musicians came down the street, 
On them she would take pity; 
So fond of the " food of love" Ivas she, 
That she made them quite her hobbies; 
She'd often fill the street with 6erman brass bands, 
Till they were bundled off by the bobbies. 
Cnoaus — 1 
loved her, and she might have been, etc. 
Now there was a 
German band, three boys and a 
man, 
Who played there every afternoon. 
They'd a " flageolet " in 0, a " einnopean " in D, 
With a " sackbut " and a " trombone " out of tune. 
They made an awful row, but still, anyhow, 
They quite charmed the heart of Susannah ; 
For she'd sit at the window, whil3t the German flageolet 
Used to wink in a 
most improper manner. 
CHORUS - I 
loved her, and she might have been, etc. 
Such goings-on were not quite right, 
And so I 
gently told her, 
And though with rage my buzum burned, 
I'd not the heart to scold her. 
The very next day, when I 
reached home, 
You might have knocked me down with a 
brick, sirs ; 
She'd bolted away with the German flageolet, 
And sold every blessed stick, sirs. 
Guonu.s — I 
loved her, and she might have been, etc.

But now she goes a-charing for eighteen pence a

rich Mormon in Utah did dwell; 
Of wives he'd five hundred, and loved them right well. 
Some big and some little, some young and some old, 
And all to maintain them he'd plenty of gold. 
(Spoken.) 
Gold at an enormous premium, and green-
backs a 
mere song in the market. 
Cnoaus — Too ra lop, etc., etc. 
His bills at the milliner's and dress-maker's, too, 
Oft made this bold husband look dreadfully blue. 
He says, " My dear creatures, for dear goodness' sake, 
Just hold in your horses, or my bank it will break." 
(Spoken.) 
No cash in the treasury, no credit at the 
corner grocery, and pockets to let. 
Cuortus— Too ra loo, etc., etc. 
When at the theatre he gave them a 
treat, 
lie chartered the house, and they filled every seat. 
The walls fairly shook, when they applauded a 
piece, 
And their hissing resembled a 
thousand wild geese. 
(Spoken.) 
Imitation of the geese, in which the audi-
ence are not invited to join. 
CHORUS - Too ra loo, etc., etc. 
When they beat the poor husband, he wished himself 
dead,

BIICKLEYS' SONGS . — 
For they pulled every spear of hair out of his head. 
They'd frighten Old Nick with the clack of their tongues, 
And deafen the ear, even old Brigham Young's. 
(Spoken.) 
Illustrating the agony of listening to the 
uproar of five hundred infuriated females. 
CHORUS — Too ral la, etc., etc. 
There were five hundred mouths to be fed every day; 
For one thousand shoes had this Mormon to pay. 
There were five hundred tongues to circulate lies, 
And five thousand fingers to scratch out his eyes. 
(Spoken.) 
Showing the insane way in which the five 
hundred vixens damaged the eyesight of the old man. 
CHORUS — Too ra la, etc., etc. 
He died very sudden, the silly old dunce, 
And five hundred wives were made widows at once; 
They set up a 
howling of sorrow and pain, 
And their lamentations were heard down in Maine. 
(Spoken.) 
Feeble imitations of the fearful noise made 
by the bereaved five hundred. 
Cnortus — Too ra la, etc., etc. 
Now off at Salt Lake there are likely old chaps, 
And the widows will soon set their five hundred caps. 
They wait for a 
husband to lighten their woes, 
But there's hardly a 
man with the pluck to propose. 
(Spoken.) 
Imaginary search in vain for the bold man 
having courage to pop the question to the blushing five 
hundred. 
CHORUS — Too ra la, etc., etc. 
Pocahontas and Captain Smith. 
Sung by R. BISHOP BUCKLEY. Words by GEO. THOMPSON. 
JOHN SMITH, he was a 
sojer man all of the ancient times, 
There's many a 
namesake hereabouts of his'n ; 
He went among the sojer-folks, cutting up his shines, 
And they took him up and clapped him into prison. 
They held a 
grand pow-wow to see what they should do 
BUCKLEYS' SONGS . 
To. 
this saucy and inquisitive young stranger. 
The red man made the white man look exceeding blue, 
And the " captain with his whiskers " was in danger. 
CHORUS — With a 
big stick, hit him quick 
On the head and make him sick. 
Pocahontas was the girl for me. 
There was King Powhattan; he was a 
naughty chief; 
He wore an iron ring right through his nose ; 
He dearly loved his peppermint, and dined upon raw beef, 
And slept upon the scalps of all his foes. 
This savage old Powhattan, who never had a 
hat on, 
his head was smooth as handle of a 
pump, 
lie said the head of Smith he was resolved to flatten, 
Not leaving the phrenologists a 
bump. 
CHORUS — With a 
big stick, etc. 
So they took poor Captain Smith, laid his head on a 
brick, 
Which he many times carried in his hat, 
And old Powhattan came, a-flourishing his stick, 
Like a 
Donnybrook or a 
Tipperary Pat. 
Says he," I'm king of clubs; you'll find that I'm a 
trump. 
A 
trick I'll show you, to provoke your laughter ; 
I'm bound to make a 
hit ; I'll fetch him such a 
thump 
He'll,be free from any headache ever after. 
Cnoaus— With a 
big stick, etc. 
Pocahontas chanced to be hanging out the clothes, 
And saw the captain's head about to cave in; 
She twigged him lying there surrounded by his foes, 
And made up her mind that she could save him. 
I 
guess she was a 
belle among the Injun girls; 
Her form was very active, lithe, and sooplc; 
She never was obliged to put on any curls, 
And never in her life had worn a 
hoople. 
. CHORUS — With a 
big stick, etc. - 
So she determined to spoil Powhattan's plan; 
She was brave as a 
lion, if not bolder,

She mixed in the disturbance, tackled the old man, 
And broke the club in two across his shoulder. 
The captain would have married her, but she was engaged. 
Not a 
blacksmith or a 
whitesmith would she wed. 
Old Powhattan, he got tight, he was so much enraged, 
And the captain thanked the maiden for his head. •

Our Dear John. 
Sung by R. BISHOP BUCKLEY. Words by GEO. THOMPSON. 
OUR John is a 
student blithe and gay, 
And with the girls a 
pet ; 
They rush in the drug store every day, 
A 
smile from him to get, 
his fair complexion to gaze upon, 
And his eyes that shine like stars. 
A 
darling duck is our dear John, 
Who belongs to the E. B. R's. 
The girls they all do wish to see 
And with our John to speak. 
One cries, " A 
liquorice stick for me," 
Or " A 
court-plaster for my cheek."

The Commercial Man; or, Sold Again. 
Sung by H. BISHOP BUCKLEY. Words by H CLIFTON. 
Tom BROWN was a 
man you don't see every iay, 
And a 
traveller, too, in the fancy goods wa ; 
But as very few journeys young Thomas bd been, 
Those he met on the road often fancied hiu green. 
Now travellers commercial are fond of a 
bke, 
And often poor Thomas would humbug ,rid smoke; 
'Neath the weight of their jokes, hewould frequently 
smart, 
Yet always appear to take all in goocThart; 
Would smile at their nonsense and

Though his sensitive soul with agoy burned ; 
But I'll tell you for once how th

They all looked surprised, and Tom looked so green. 
" 
You travel for 
nose!? 
Oh, it's Moses you mean." 
" 
Not Moses, but noses," Torn answered him blue ; 
" 
And as yours seems a 
big one, I'll buy it of you, 
And give a 
good price, as the end is so red; 
And not ask for the nose until after you're dead," 
" 
You will? " said the swell ; " but when will you pay ? " 
" 
Whenever you please ; if you like, pay to-day ; 
But mind, if the bargain you chance to repent, 
The money's returned, and five pounds to be spent 
In a 
round of champagne for the lot," added Brown. 
" 
Agreed," said the swell, and the money went down. 
The old ones exclaimed, " It's really too bad 
To swindle the young man ; he's certainly mad, 
Bereft of his senses ' tile loose,' that's plain, 
To purchase a 
nose he may ne'er see again." 
But Torn called a 
waiter, and then in his ear 
Whispered something he wished not the others to hear,• 
Then joined in the song, applauded the toast; 
In fact; he appeared in himself quite a 
host; 
Bat friends they mast part ; so the company rose, 
Amongst them, the swell who sold Toni his nose, 
And said, " Old fellah, when death shall me kill, 
I'll take care to leave you my nose in my will." 
But that moment the waiter ran in like a 
shot, 
With a 
large pair of tongs; the ends were red hot. 
Tom seized on the tongs; and moving a 
pace 
In advance, put the ends near the knowing one's face. 
" 
Why, what do you mean? " said, the swell, in affright, 
For the ends singed his cherished moustaches outright. 
" 
Excuse me," said Tom, " I 
regret to give pain, 
But I 
must mark my nose just to know it again." 
The knowing one saw he was cleverly done ; 
The others all laughed, and applauded the fun, 
For the swell did not care to have half his nose burned, 
Stood the round of champagne and the tables were turned.

BUCKLEY& SONG S. 
Water-Cresses. 
Sung by R. B ISHOP B UCKLEY. Words by H ARRY CL IFTON. 
I 
Am a 
jolly farmer; from Bedfordshire I 
came 
To see some friends at Camberwell, and Morgan is my 
name. 
At a 
dairy farm near Dunstable I 
live, when I'm at home, 
And if I 
get safe back again, from there 
never roam. 
But if you'll give attention, I 
will tell without delay 
how a 
buxom little damsel my affections led astray, 
And promised for to marry me upon the first of May, 
And left me with a 
bunch of water-cresses. 
'Twits on the first of April when I 
arrived in town, 
And being quite a 
stranger I 
wandered up and down 
Until I 
lost myself entire,— I 
cannot tell you where ; 
But it was in a 
very quiet street, the comer of a 
square. 
A neatly- dressed young woman came walking down the 
way. 
As long as I 
remember, I 
shall ne'er forget the day ; 
For she promised for to marry me upon the first of May, 
And left me with a 
bunch of water-cresses. 
Politely I 
addressed her, and thus to her did say : 
" 
I 
wish to go to Camberwell: Can you direct the way?" 
" 
Oh, yes, sir, — oh, yes, sir," she speedily replied. 
" 
Take the „turning on the left, then go down the other 
side." 
Her voice it was the sweetest I 
ever yet did hear. 
In her hands, which like the lily were so very white and 
clear, 
She'd a 
bunch of early onions, and a 
half a 
pint of beer, 
Some pickles, and a 
bunch of water-cresses. 
I 
bowed and I 
thanked her and walked by her side, 
And thought how well she'd look as a 
dairy farmer's 
bride. 
I 
gathered resolution ; half in earnest, half in joke, 
I 
hinted matrimony. 
These very words I 
spoke: 
" 
I've a 
farm of forty acres, I've horses, cows, and geese, 
BUCKLEY& SONGS. 
23 
Besides, I've a 
dairy filled with buttermilk and cheese. • 
Will you marry me, and mistress be, fair lady, of all 
these? 
And we'll pass our days on love and water-crosses." 
She replied with a 
smile, or a 
leer, if you choose, 
" 
You are so very generous I 
cannot well refuse; 
So give me your direction, and I 
will, without delay, 
Prepare for matrimony, to love, honor, and obey. 
I've a 
wedding dress to buy, and some little bills to pay." 
I 
handed her a 
sovereign, expenses to defray, 
And she promised for to marry me upon the first of May. 
When she left me with a 
bunch of water- crosses. 
Next day a 
letter I 
received, and read there, with sur-
prise, 
" 
Dear sir,— for disappointing you I 
must apologize; 
But when next you ask a 
stranger into partnership for 
life, 
Be sure she is a 
widow, or a 
maiden,— not a 
wife. 
I've a 
husband of my awn, and his name is Willie Gray; 
And when I 
can afford it the sovereign I'll pay. 
To think that I 
should marry you upon .the first of May 
Why, you must have been as green as water-cresses! "

to me has sent ; 
But childer aint like pigs, you know ; they can't pay the

She gave me every shilling there was in the till, 
And kissed me fifty times or more, as if she'd never get 
her fill. 
"

The eating and the drinking, too, is beautiful and fine ;

The Perambulator; or Matilda's Young 
Guard. 
Sung by R. BISHOP BUCKLEY. 
I'VE fallen in love with a 
pretty young girl; 
My wife I 
think I'll make her ; 
I 
met her first up Primrose Hill, 
As she drove a 
perambulator: 
Such charming feet, for I 
watched her heels, 
As I 
came up behind her. 
There may be a 
fairer in the land, 
But I 
don't know where you'll find her. 
CHORUS — For she's just about the age, 
And she's all the rage, 
Is ray Matilda Baker. 
She looks so fair, 
With her yellow curly hair, 
And she drives a 
perambulator. 
Her perambulator looks so fine, 
With.blue and dark brown paint, oh, 
Picked out with pink and yellow stripes, 
And lined with bright magenta. 
Two babes inside, so fat and plump, 
Like Cupids they are thriving, 
And she looks like the guardian angel, as 
She up the hill goes driving. 
Cnoitus — For she's just, etc. 
Introduced myself as soon 
As I 
could overtake her, 
By saying, " My dear, will you let me push 
Your handsome perambulator ? "

Yes, certainly," she spoke so nice 
And chatted on so,gayly, 
Oh ! don't I 
love that handsome girl ! 
And so I 
meet her daily. 
Cnonus — For she's just, etc. 
You should see her blush so very neat; 
Her cheeks like roses flushing, 
And gayly trots on by my side, 
While I 
does all the pushing. 
She's told me all about her friends; 
Such kindness she has shown me; 
And she's promised me her protograph; 
I'm sure that girl's sweet on me. 
CHORUS — For she's just, etc.

The Fair Girl Dressed in Check. 
Sung by R. BISHOP BUCKLEY. Words by VANCE. 
I 
WENT to Brighton on August fine; forget it I 
never can; 
While on the Grand Parade I 
saw, oh, such a 
duck of a 
man ; 
He'd been sailing in the Skylark, and stood upon the deck; 
It was very plain to see how he stared at me, the fair girl 
dressed in cheek. 
CHORE'S —  
The fair girl dressed in cheek; 
, 
I'm the f'air girl dressed in check; 
'Twas my manner and my 
hair that made him stare 
At the fair girl dressed in check. 
My dress was looped up gracefully, which showed my 
pretty feet, 
Enclosed in a 
pair of bronzed kid boots; prettier you 
couldn't meet. 
He followed me and my lap-
dog, which I 
led by a 
string 
to its neck; 
It wasn't the dog that attracted the rogue, but this fair 
girl dressed in check. 
Cnoaus— The fair girl, etc. 
The day being clear, I 
strolled on the pier, to inhale the 
bracing air ; 
What met my eyes, to my surprise, was the same gent 
standing there ; 
He politely did invite me down to Melton's for a 
quiet 
peek. 
I 
gracefully declined, for in no such frame of mind felt 
the fair girl dressed in check. 
CHORUS -- The fair girl, etc. •

wreck, 
Unless I'd married be, and happy he would be with this 
fair girl dressed in check. 
CHORUS — The fair girl, etc. 
Albert Fitzpup was so complaisant, I 
said he should 
happy be; 
So earnestly he pressed that in check he should be 
dressed, and married on a 
Wednesdee. 
The affair came off; our friends did laugh and say, 
" ' Twas a 
very good speck." 
And well does he agree with our children three, and this 
fair girl dressed in check. 
CHORUS — The fair girl dressed in check; 
The fair girl classed in check ; 
Sing joyous and free, they still call me 
The fair girl dressed in check. 
Tilda Toots 
or, You Should have seen 
her Boots. 
Sung by It. BISHOP BUCKLEY. 
ONE frosty day, on pleasure bent, I 
strolled into the park, 
With skates in hand, upon the ice to have a 
skating lark. 
Some were whirling round like tops, some darting like a 
flash 
Others cut their names out, too, and others cut a 
dash; 
But not alone was I ;that day, for there, in fur-topped 
p 
And four rows of pearl 
buttons, 
was ng own Matilda 
Toots. 
CHORUS — Oh, my own ratilda Toots! you should have 
seen her boots

Upon the ice, they looked so nice, did the boots of Tilda 
Toots. 
Oh, Matihla Toots! you should have seen her boots; 
Upon the ice, they looked so nice, did the boots of Tilda 
Toots. 
She had the prettiest pair of skates, of highly-polished 
steel, 
And gracefully in chair she sat, while I 
prepared to kneel 
Down at her tCet, to put them on, by boring in the soles 
Of those fur-topped, pearl-buttoned bouts, the smallest 
gimlet holes ; 
But just as I 
upon my knee had got one of her boots, 
A skater from behind, upset me, chair, and Tilda Toots. 
Cnonus — Oh, my own, etc. 
As 11 the ehair, and Tilda Toots were struggling in _ a 
heap, 
A dozen skaters more or less, came o'er us 
w ith a sweep; 
Some went tumbling head o'er heels, others on the back; 
When suddenly where Tilda lay, the ice began to crack; 
The water next came bubbling up. 
Crash! I 
saw the 
boots 
Alone above the waters, where had gone down Tilda Toots. 
Cuonus— Oh, my own, etc. , 
"'Seape ladders, grappling hooks, and belts! " I 
roared 
with all my might. 
The Royal Humane Society's men then quickly hove in 
sight; 
They ran the ladder across the hole; the men aside I 
cast; 
I 
scarcely think I 
touched a 
rail, I 
rushed along so fast; 
But I 
was there in time to save the one of my pursuits, 
For by those boots, those fur-topped boots, I 
dragged out 
Tilda Toots. 
CHORUS — Oh, my own, etc. 
With Tilda in my arms, to the Receiving House I 
flew.

They used the proper remedies, and quickly brought her

DON'T say I'm right; there's a

CHORUS —
It's that selfish expression of, " Mind number

Whilst you're young and in health, by industry gain

BUCKLEYS' SONGS. 
But be poor and in want, and just ask for a 
loan; 
The need' you set forth they oft mock it, 
And say, " I'm so short," or, " Really, I 
can't," 
Or, " I 
haven't so much in my pocket." 
CHORUS — And say, " FM 
so short," etc. 
They say ' tis no sin to be wanting in tin ; 
The nerve of those needy ' twill shock it ; 
So where'er you roam, abroad or at home, 
Put your only true friend in your pocket. 
Cnoaus — So where'er you roam, etc. 
Sweet Jenny. 
Sung by R. 
BISHOP BUCKLEY. Words by VANCE. 
I 
COME from Laaf and da,af and half and half, 
Across the Welsh mountains, 
Where the leeks and the violets 
And the nanny-goats do dwell. 
I 
come here in search 
Of a 
lovely young damsel, 
And where she has -gone to, 
I'm sure I 
can't tell. 
(Spoken.) 
More I 
can. 
CHORUS — So I 
weep and I 
A.;ander 
Through vales and o'er mountains, 
To find my sweet Jenny. 
Oh! where can she be? 
She's a 
charming young gender, 
Her waist is so slender; 
Her hair is magenta, 
And she squints with one eye. 
She talks like a 
parson ; 
She sings like a 
nightingale; 
And if I 
don't find her, 
I'm sure I 
shall die. 
(Spoken.) 
So I 
shall. 
CHORUS — SO I 
weep, etc. 
BUCKLEYS' SONGS. 
Her home and her parients 
Are highly respectable; 
Her mother milks cows 
On a 
three-legged stool ; 
Her father's a 
farmer, 
What grows the green turnip-tops; 
Her sister's a 
dairymaid, 
And her brother's a 
fool. 
(Spoken.). 
So he are. 
CHORUS — So I 
weep, etc. 
I 
courted sweet Jenny; 
I 
told her I 
loved her; 
We were to be married 
Upon a 
May morn, 
When there came ai gay soldier 
In the Royal Artillery. 
And on the next morning, 
Sweet Jenny was gone. 
(Spoken.) 
So she were. 
CHORUS — 4() I 
weep, etc. 
I've searched through the valleys; 
I've roamed o'er the mountains; 
I've climbed mighty " Snowdon ; " 
I've looked in the air; 
I've searched holes and corners; 
I've read through the papers; 
I've looked up the chimney; 
But I 
find her nowhere. 
(Spoken.) 
More I 
don't. 
CHORUS — So I 
weep, etc. 
Oh, say, have you seen her? 
To you I'll describe her; 
She wears a 
red petticoat, 
And a 
hat on her head; 
She speaks while she's talking ;-
She moves when she's walking;

(Spoken.)

CHORUS — SO 
I

But I 
never shall find her; 
She's gone with her soldier. 
So farewell to the violets, 
And the moo cows so brown; 
Farewell to the nanny-goats. 
To the sea-shore I'll wander, 
And in the cold water 
I'll lay myself down. 
(Spoken.) 
So I 
will. 
CHORUS — So no more I'll wander, 
Through vales and o'er mountains; 
Farewell, my sweet Jenny, 
Wherever you be.

Pm going to sing a

If you will list to me. 
It's not too short, and not too long; 
But that you'll quickly see. 
I

Though your verdict I 
don't fear. 
In fact, it's a 
sort of song you read about, 
But very seldom hear. ( Repeat.) 
I 
knew a 
girl named Angeline 
Who lived in Regent Street. 
She'd the loveliest of figures, and 
The smallest of small feet. 
Such pearly teeth and ruby lips 
And raven locks had she; 
In fact, a

But very seldom see. ( Repeat.)

I 
loved her and she loved me, too, 
And soon became my wife. 
Now we're as happy as the day is long, 
And always free from strife. 
Should I 
stay out late, she never scolds ; 
She's as quiet as can be; 
In fact, a 
sort of wife you read about, 
But very seldom see. ( Repeat.) 
The Federals and Confederates 
In America, you know, 
Seem just as much inclined to fight 
As they were two years ago. 
Some say that this disastrous war 
At an end will shortly be. 
It's a 
sort of war we read about, 
But fear we'll never see. (Repeat.) 
The Prince of Wales's baby has 
Again arrived at home, 
And the newspapers report that he's 
The loveliest baby known. 
Such a 
handsome face and noble brow, 
And smart young chap is he; 
In fact, it's a 
sort of kid you read about, 
But very seldom see. ( Repeat.) 
To supply the•babe with milk, 
A 
cow was sent till he got home; 
And the mayor of hull paid any amount 
To call the cow his own. 
I 
don't know if aught particular 
About the cow there be ; 
Perhaps it's a 
sort of cow you read about, 
But very seldom see. ( Repeat.) 
In Liverpool the Davenports 
Have come to sudden grief; 
For in spirits, except with water mixed, 
The folks have no belief.

Their Cabinet was smashed to pieces ; so 
Let this a 
warning be 
To humbugs that we read about, 
But seldom wish to see. (Repeat.) 
There's the great Chetwynd divorce case, 
Which, of course, you all have read, — 
How the husband thought it not amiss 
To punch his poor wife's head. 
Though her conduct, mind, I 
don't excuse; 
She's just as bad as ho ; in fact, 
They're a 
couple that we read about, 
But very seldom see. ( Repeat.). 
For the Surrey Theatre sufferers 
I 
mention with great pride 
That the Daily Telegraph 
Then fifty guineas did subscribe. 
I 
consider this a 
generous act ; 
For they've come down handsomely 
With a sum you often read about, 
But very seldom see. (Repeat.) 
The robbery at Walker's shop 
I 
think shows great neglect 
On the part of the policeman, 
Who our property should protect ; 
But you know that it is a 
well-known fact, 
And I'm sure you'll all agree 
That a 
bobby when he's wanted 
You can very seldom see. ( Repeat.) 
I 
think I'll now conclude my song, 
And p'r'aps you'll say it's time ; 
Though i 
hope I've not displeased you 
With my little bit of rhyme. 
And now that I 
have done, I 
hope 
You'll say this mach of me, — 
That I'm a 
sort of' chap you read about 
But very seldom see. ( Repeat.)

To meet him in the morning— orning.

The morning came; no letter did, 
Cos the postman he forgot it— got it; 
Though he delivered a

But that theranote was not it — not it.

Oh, cruel postman to forget 
That letter to deliver — liver. 
Said she, " My true love is false to me," 
Then she sploshed into the river — iver.

" 
Pull-Back." 
Sung by R. Bisnor BUCKLEY. Words by HARRY CLIFTON. 
As a 
field is full of stubble, 
So life is but a 
bubble, 
Nothing here but trouble, 
And everything a 
pull- back. 
Of that there is no doubting, 
Though every one is shouting, 
What can you do without the ready money ? 
Oh, oh, oh, lye hit upon a 
plan, — 
Try to be happy, and always do the best you can. 
CHORUS— For why should we so wretched be, 
As time rolls swiftly on. 
Though clouds o'ercast, they cannot last 
We must have one day's sun. 
The world is wide, and then, beside, 
Our life is but a 
span. 
'Mid all our fears, our joys, our tears, 
We'll do the best we can. 
I 
was seven long years apprentice 
To a 
Singem dentist. 
Ile, " non compos mentis," 
Thought everything a 
pull-back. 
Folks we couldn't trust 'cm, 
Because we had no custom, 
And what can you do without the ready money 7. 
Oh, oh, 
oh, oh, I've hit upon a 
plan,— 
Try to be happy, and always do the best we can. 
CHORUS - For why should We so wretched be, etc. 
I 
courted one Matilda; 
With words of love I 
filled her; 
Her father was a 
builder. 
Here was another pull-back. 
For wedlock she was willing ; 
'I was not worth a 
shilling, 
And what can you do without the ready money ? 
Oh, oh, oh, I've hit upon a 
plan, — 
Try to be happy, and always do the best we can. 
CHORUS — For why should we so wretched lie, etc. 
In very hasty pleasure 
I 
married to my treasure, 
And repented, too, at leisure; 
For there was another pull-back. 
Experience it taught us 
With thirteen sons and daughters. 
How could we do without the ready money? 
Oh, oh, oh, I've hit upon a 
plan,— 
Try to be happy, and always do the best we can. 
Cnortus— For why should we so wretched be. etc. 
Every man's a 
bother, 
So trouble let us smother 
By helping one another 
In spite of every pull-back. 
Don't give way to sorrow ; 
Better times to-morrow. 
What can you do without the ready money ? 
Oh, oh, oh, I've hit upon a 
plan, — 
Try to be happy, and always do the best you can.

The Rocky Road to Dublin. 
Sung by R. Bisnor BUCKLEY. Words by D. K. GAvAN. 
IN 
the merry month .of June, 
From my home I 
started, 
Left the girls of Tuam 
Nearly broken-hearted, 
Saluted father dear, 
Kissed my darling mother, 
Drank a 
pint of beer, 
My grief and tears to smother. 
Then off to reap the corn, • 
And leave where I 
was born, 
I 
cut a 
stout blackthorn, 
To banish ghost or goblin ; 
In a 
brand-new pair of brogues, 
I 
rattled over the bogs, 
And frightened all the dogs, 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. 
CHORUS — Whack fal lal le ral, whack fal lal le ral, 
Whack fal lal le, whack falai rido. 
In Mulligan that night, 
rested limbs so weary, 
Started by daylight 
Next morning, light and airy, 
Took a 
drop o' the pine, 
To keep my spirits from sinking; 
That's an Irishman's eine, • 
Whenever he's in for drinking. 
To see the lasses smile, 
Laughing all the while, 
At my curious style, 
'Twould set your heart a-babblin' ; 
They axed if I 
was hired, 
The wages I 
required, 
Till I 
was almost tired, 
Of the Rocky Road to Dublin.

In Dublin next arrived, 
I 
thought it such a

To be so soon deprived 
A 
view of that fine city; 
Then I 
took a 
stroll 
Among the quality.; 
My bundle it was stole, 
In a 
neat locality. 
Something crossed my mind, 
Then I 
looked behind; 
No bundle could I 
find; 
Upon my stick a 
wobblin', 
Inquiring for the rogue, 
They said my Connaught brogue 
Wasn't much in vogue, 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. 
CHORUS — Whack fal lal le lal, etc. 
From there I 
got away, 
My spirits never 
Landed on the quay, 
As the ship was sailin' ; 
Captain at me roared, 
Said that no room had he, 
When I 
jumped aboard. 
A 
cabin found for paddy, 
Down among the pigs.; 
I 
played some funny rigs, 
Danced some hearty jigs, 
The tater round me bubblin'. 
When off Holyhead, 
I 
wished myself was dead, 
Or, better far instead, 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin.

Called myself a

SOME say 'twas in England I

But as writers or heroes are often astray, 
I 
think for myself I'll have something to say. 
Oh ! the night I

very well know, 
When the clergyman tumbled in covered with snow; 
He laid hold of myself, and sat down by the fire, 
And made a 
good boy of young Darby McGuire.

Then hurrah for ould Ireland, the land of my 
birth; 
'Tis there you'll get plenty of pleasure and mirth ; 
Where the beautiful girls are sure to admire 
Such rollicksome fellows as Darby McGuire. 
From christ'nings to weddings what heavenly bliss, 
As I 
stand by the bride and obtain the first kiss; 
While the creature looks sly as if nothing occurred, 
And the husband looks daggers, bat daren't say a

()eh, then the carving of praties and pigs;

At the pleasure of dancing with Darby McGuire.

Paddy's Dream. 
Sung by R. Bisuor BLTCKLEY. Words by G. W ARS 
JoBN BULL he was an Englishman, 
And went on tramp one day 
With threepence in his pocket 
To take him a

He tramped along for miles and miles, 
Yet no one did he see 
Till he fell in with an Irishman 
Whose name was Paddy McGee. 
Cnoacs— Till he fell, etc. 
" 
Good-morning, Pat," says John to him. 
" 
Where are you going to? " 
Says he, " I 
hardly know myself; 
I 
want a 
job to do." 
" 
Have you got any money about you?" 
Said John Bull unto Pat. 
" 
It's the only thing I'm wanting; 
For I 
haven't got a 
rap." 
CHORUS — It's the only thing, etc. 
Then they overtook a 
Scotchman 
Who was like them out of work. 
To judge by his looks, he was hard up, 
And as hungry as a 
Turk. 
" 
Can you lend me a 
shilling, Scotty?" 
At last said Paddy McGee. 
" 
I'm sorry I 
canna," said the Scotchman; 
" 
For I

Said the Englishman, " I

What shall we do with that? " 
" 
Och! buy threepen"orth of w'hiskey; 
It will cheer us up," said Pat. 
" 
Nay, dinna doo that," said the Seotehman; 
" 
I'll tell thee the best to doo :— 
Just buy threepence worth of oat-meal; 
I'll make some nice bonjoo." 
Cnons— Just buy, etc. 
" 
Now I 
think we had better buy a

The Englishman did say; 
" 
And then in yonder haystack 
Our hunger sleep away. 
We can get a 
drink of water 
From yonder purling stream, - 
And the loaf shall be his in the morning 
Who has the greatest dream." 
CHORUS — And the loaf, etc. 
The Englishman dreamt by the morning 
Ten million men had been 
For ten years digging a 
turnip up, — 
The largest ever seen. 
At last they got the turnip up 
By working night and day, 
Then it took five million horses 
This turnip to pull away. 
CHORUS — Then it took, etc. 
Said the Seotchman, " I've been dreaming 
Fifty million men had been

It was made of copper," said Scotty,
