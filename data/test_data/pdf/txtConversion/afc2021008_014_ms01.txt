Elinor Levy (00:03): 
Good afternoon today is Wednesday, June 8th.... 
Aaron Paige (00:10): 
2022. 
Elinor Levy (00:10): 
2022. This is Elinor Levy, E L I N O R L E V Y and I'm with my research fellowship partner, Aaron Paige, A A 
R O N P A I G E. And we are interviewing... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (00:29): 
Bridgetlee Goldstein, B R I D G E T L E E G O L D S T E I N. 
Elinor Levy (00:37): 
For the Archie Green Fellowship Project, Community Health Workers in Downstate New York. So we've 
already asked your name and, what do you usually go by? What do you like to be called? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (00:48): 
Bridgetlee, B, anything is fine. 
Elinor Levy (00:50): 
Okay. So B, we usually start really easy. If you're okay with this. Where were you born? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (00:56): 
I was born in Manhasset, Long Island, right by Great Neck. 
Elinor Levy (01:00): 
And did you grow up there, and go to school there? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (01:04): 
I did not. I lived there in my early childhood. I moved up to the Dutchess County region, and then I went 
to elementary, middle school, and stuff in Dutchess County. I moved to Brooklyn in my teens for several 
years, and then I moved back up to the Dutchess County area in my early twenties. And I've been here 
since. 
Elinor Levy (01:24): 
Okay. 
Aaron Paige (01:25): 
Also, sorry. What year were you born? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (01:28): 
I was born in 90. 
Aaron Paige (01:30): 
Okay. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (01:31): 
Yes. 
Aaron Paige (01:31): 
Thank you. 
Elinor Levy (01:32): 
You mentioned before we started that you've been doing health care work of one kind or another since 
2007, if you wanna start that far back? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (01:44): 
So my first encounter with doing community outreach came around 2007. While I was in college in 
Brooklyn, they had a job offering for the Harm Reduction Coalition. It paid $10 an hour for 10 hours a 
week, and it was community outreach in south Brooklyn. We did handout condoms. We would offer STD 
testing, STD education. We would help link people to different types of care, whether it be medical, 
dental, shelters, housing, substance use treatment. They did have syringe exchange programs. We 
would also provide people with clean supplies for injection. We would educate people on proper 
injection techniques and really just the compass of outreach services that you can provide. And that was 
my first with outreach. 
Elinor Levy (02:44): 
And what led you to do that? Was it the $10 an hour? Was it the work itself? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (02:50): 
I'm a very friendly, social person and I will talk to absolutely everybody when I'm walking around, and I 
just sparked...They had their van sitting there while I was walking around in the area, and just sparked 
up a conversation with me and they asked me. They said, you know, "Would you be interested in this?" 
And I was like, "Yeah, why not?" You know, I'm college kid, I needed a little extra side job wherever I can 
take one. And I was like, "That's great. Part-time yeah, let's do it." I thought it was really cool. I loved the 
people. I lived in Coney island and there was a very diverse community, ethnically, socioeconomically. I 
would always say hi to everybody no matter who you were. I just wanted to help people in my 
community. 
Elinor Levy (03:32): 
How long did you hold that position? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (03:34): 
I did that until about 2010 in the city, and then I transferred some elements to it to this area, because at 
the time Dutchess County did not offer those services. So we kind of, on the low, helped bring it into the 
community up here, through another branch of them that they had in Catskills, we kind of coordinated. 
It was more like low-key community outreach, because it wasn't as socially acceptable back then. 
Elinor Levy (04:08): 
And did you stop for a while before you picked up again? Or did you... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (04:12): 
Yeah, I kind of transferred it over. I guess I came up here, you know, I kind of just was like, "Oh, let's see 
if I can do this here too." 
Elinor Levy (04:24): 
Did that then spark sort of an inspiration to do community health care work or? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (04:31): 
I liked doing it. It wasn't necessarily at the time a path I thought my life was gonna go down. But, I knew 
I wanted to be in the medical field. Originally, I wanted to be a surgeon, but that wasn't happening. So I 
figured, I like helping people. So, any job that I can take that involves some sort of helping people is 
good with me. 
Elinor Levy (04:53): 
And what led you to, I guess then it was Hudson River Health? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (04:57): 
Before that I became a medical assistant. 
Elinor Levy (04:59): 
Oh, okay. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (05:00): 
And I still do that per diem, mainly in podiatry. I've been doing that for nearly 10 years now. And then at 
some point, I acquired Sun River Health in between. 
Elinor Levy (05:11): 
Mm-hmm. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (05:13): 
Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (05:13): 
And what did you first do with Sun River Health? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (05:16): 
So, initially with Sun River Health, my husband and I had been patients there, and one of the providers 
there that my husband had been a patient of, her and I just really clicked. She had been working on 
building up their MAT program at the time. But she said they had another opportunity in Hep-C, and she 
was like, "You're great with people. You always want talk to everybody. You like to help people." She's 
like, "I think you'd be good for this position. Would you be interested in it?" And I was like, "Yeah, why 
not? Let's try it." So that was how I got into community health and into outreach, was via their Hep-C 
program. 
Aaron Paige (06:01): 
How long did you work in that program before switching to the MAT? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (06:04): 
I did the Hep C program for about two and a half years until, her name is Dr. Kelly Ramsey, when she got 
enough grants to fund more positions and really make it its own department. I hopped right on board 
the second I heard they got that grant. 
Elinor Levy (06:20): 
And what's MAT? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (06:21): 
Medication assisted treatment. So that encompasses the whole umbrella of your alcohol use disorders, 
opioid use disorders, amphetamine use disorders, anything is umbrellaed under the medication assisted 
treatment. And that was my area of interest. I always found that to be really fascinating. 
Aaron Paige (06:41): 
That's the program you've been working with all this time since... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (06:45): 
Yes. I've been working with that program now since... for the last three years. Yeah, I believe I started 
with them in mid 2019. 
Elinor Levy (06:56): 
And what is it that you find fascinating? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (06:59): 
I really love pharmacology. I also considered doing pharmaceutical research initially when I went to 
college. I wanted to be some kind...Once surgeon was out of the question, I was like, "Maybe I could be 
a research scientist. Maybe I could find a vaccine for cancer or AIDS or just some miracle something." 
But I really like the pharmacology aspect, and I really enjoy working with the patient population. 
Specifically, the patients that I tend to get from my caseload. I love working with the people that are 
recently released from incarceration, people that are, you know, fresh out of prison on parole. I get a lot 
of patients that are homeless, struggling with co-occurring mental health disorders. Those are the ones 
that I really enjoy working with. I like the challenges. They always send me those ones. 
Aaron Paige (07:46): 
And your position at Sun River. What's the title? 
Elinor Levy (07:50): 
I am an MAT Peer. 
Aaron Paige (07:52): 
An MAT Peer. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (07:53): 
Yes. 
Aaron Paige (07:54): 
So one of the things we've been learning about peers since we've been interviewing peers, is that they 
often have a shared experience of... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (08:01): 
So I come in in this kind of... in a weird sense. My husband was one of their original MAT patients when 
the program started in 2013, and that was how I had met her. So while that was not something I had 
actually lived experience with, I had the experience of living with someone who did that. So I was able to 
get in from that side. 
Elinor Levy (08:27): 
What kind of perspective does that give you, as opposed to being a direct peer? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (08:32): 
I feel like I've struggled a lot with my husband over the years, for many years. We've been together now 
for 11 years, 11 or 12? I have no idea at this point. I've tried so many different things to help get him to 
the place that he is in now, that I feel like I have a lot of tools to work with individuals that are 
struggling. He's tried several different inpatient rehabs, outpatients, different types of medications and 
everything. And I feel like I, firsthand, have worked very closely with somebody, and see that there isn't 
just one way into recovery, that there are so many different options and everything. And I feel like that 
makes me somebody who can really be well versed in understanding, to know that what might help one 
person might not help somebody else. And that's totally okay. So let's find what's gonna work for you. 
Elinor Levy (09:34): 
And it sounds like the MAT Program at Sun River is dialed into that, where sometimes you get programs 
where it's a single path. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (09:43): 
We are not allowed to prescribe methadone, that can only be prescribed from a...Oh, what's the word 
for a... like a federally methadone maintenance treatment program. So, we do sometimes have patients 
that struggle with... Like we offer Suboxone, which is like a film you take under your tongue orally, daily. 
You can take it once, twice, three times a day. We offer Vivitrol, which is an intramuscular gluteal 
injection that you get once a month that is a blocker. So it just blocks the opioid receptors. Whereas 
buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist, which does kind of fit the receptors. So it does provide some 
of the same things, but at the same time, it blocks the receptors so that other opioids can't bind to 
them. And now we also offer Sublocade, which is a monthly injection you get near your navel, and that's 
basically the buprenorphine, which is what Suboxone is, but it's an injection you get once a month. So 
there are a lot of different treatments, and we do have people that what we offer might not work for 
them. They might benefit from going everyday to the methadone program in a more intense program. 
And being able to recognize when something might be better for someone else is important. 
Elinor Levy (11:14): 
So within that, do you also offer services that direct them to housing and... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (11:21): 
Yes. So that is where we have case managers that come in. So even though my title is an MAT peer, I do 
do a lot of case management work with individuals as well. So we assist with helping people get grants 
for housing, like an RSS. We have lists of different landlords that take section eight, different places, to 
refer them to. And we work with some other agencies as well, to help link them to different things in the 
community that can be beneficial. Like with Access-VR, if somebody expresses interest in educational, 
vocational training, we can assist them with that. Basically, you know, somebody can come in, it could 
be anything that they might need help with. They might need help with an application for something. 
We help them with that as well. If they're struggling with food, we keep resources of different pantries 
and stuff like that. So we really try to just provide a huge toolbox to be able to help provide them with 
the tools that they need, And anything we can do to help them. 
Elinor Levy (12:33): 
Does that include counseling? Does the MAT program provide counseling, or does it refer people to 
counseling? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (12:39): 
So there are different ways that the program functions with that. We do have an onsite social worker, 
that if you are interested in engaging for therapy sessions with, that is an option. We do have a 
psychiatric nurse practitioner. So for some of our patients, it's a good fit to stay in-house. For other 
patients though, we will work on getting them linked to mental health with an outside mental health 
facility that is more directed towards treating mental health. And we will also work with people that go 
to some of the different programs that they offer... like the Lexington has groups and stuff like that. 
Another one is Pros but...So different areas with mental health, we will link them to outside facilities, 
but we do have some services in-house. We just don't have a psychiatrist. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (13:41): 
And really, we do find a lot of the time that we will help our patients find a psychiatrist and therapist 
that works with them, because that does tend to be an integral part of treatment for many of our 
patients. 
Aaron Paige (13:55): 
Do you find that it's sometimes the case where you're meeting with a patient, and they're not coming to 
you with a need. But you're able to see, and maybe identify that there's a need, just in the conversation 
with the patient? Like there are certain things you're looking for and thinking about. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (14:11): 
Yes. So, the way it works is we do care plans. So initially when someone comes into our program, we'll 
do a care plan with them. And in that care plan, we will try to identify what needs that they might have. 
Some people might not even realize that some of the things that we can assist them with, and 
depending on... Unfortunately, our case managers, it goes by what insurance you have to be able to get 
an actual case manager. Managed Medicaid plans, unfortunately, are the only ones our case managers 
are able to take, just the way our program is set up. But if somebody does have a few different needs 
that they would like to work on, then they can be assigned a case manager that will really work with 
them. Otherwise, I kind of fill in the gaps for the ones that don't meet the criteria necessarily but still 
might need a little help with referrals for other doctors, getting health insurance, setting up medical 
transportation for people, helping schedule appointments. So I try to fill the gaps for the people that 
don't qualify for those services. 
Aaron Paige (15:21): 
So in a lot of ways the people who are most at risk, or most vulnerable, I mean, in the sense that they 
don't necessarily have the same kind of access to... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (15:31): 
Typically though, most of our patients do have a managed Medicaid care plan. 
Aaron Paige (15:35): 
Ah. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (15:35): 
So they are able to qualify if they have a co-occurring condition, like diabetes or a mental health 
condition, then that would qualify them to get the case management services that we offer. But if for 
whatever reason, if they're not interested in that, and they just are like, "Hey, you know, I'm having a 
hard time finding a psychiatrist. Can somebody help me?" Then they'll pass it over my way. And I'll just 
help link them to that, and not follow them on my caseload, per se. 
Elinor Levy (16:01): 
Out of the multiple populations the program works with, why are you drawn to the coming out of prison 
population? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (16:12): 
I always root for the underdog. I prefer to work with people that I can make a difference in their life 
more so, and the ones that seem to really be having a harder time; I find it more rewarding. You know, if 
somebody shows up, "Hey!" They're doing great or whatever, they're just switching to a new doctor 
because they don't like the other one for whatever, but they have housing, employment, things like 
that, there's not that much I'm able to help them with. You know, I like to really try to work with people 
that are really struggling and I like to make a difference for other people. I find it very rewarding. 
Aaron Paige (16:47): 
So much of the peer relationship is about the relationship itself, right? And cultivating that relationship. 
Of course that relationship differs from person to person. Going back to your experience with your 
husband, for example..dDo you draw on that experience as a way of connecting with others? How do 
you build those connections? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (17:13): 
It really varies on person to person. I have some patients that I've been working with in MAT since I 
came into MAT in 2019 They're under my quote-un-quote caseload, even though it's not official. I do 
work with a set group of people that I follow. The other population I also get is our MAT mommies. So, 
another thing that I did at the health center, COVID unfortunately put a stop to it, was we were doing 
group prenatal classes under the women's health department. I was working with a midwife in doing 
patient education for the group prenatal classes, which I found really rewarding. So then in turn, I got a 
lot of the MAT mommies. I love working with expectant mothers. It's a very joyous time. It's a lot of 
excitement and you know, moms are very motivated. They really want to get things going and really get 
to a better place for their child. So you find it's a highly motivated population to work with. 
Elinor Levy (18:19): 
How do you create boundaries? You seem like one of the most level people I've met in a long time. For a 
person who's very, very busy, how do you create the boundaries that help keep you... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (18:37): 
My work phone is only on during work hours. My work email, I will not check unless I'm at work. At the 
end of the day when I am done and I clock out, I'm done with work until the next day I work. So that's 
how, I guess I kind of... 
Elinor Levy (18:52): 
Is that a boundary you set from the beginning, or is that a boundary you had to learn how to set because 
you didn't? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (19:00): 
No, I think because from the department I came from that was very cut and dry. When you're done for 
the day you're done for the day. It just pretty much carried over. And another interesting thing is 
because of the experience that I have in being a part of the community, I do know a lot of our patients 
from every day life. And they're always so happy to see me. They're like, "Oh my God, Bridgetlee, you 
work here. That's so cool. I'm so glad." And I think that makes them feel very comfortable. A lot of 
people have met me over the years. So it's a face that they recognize and somebody that they're familiar 
with. I have had several patients that were really struggling, but they had a good rapport with me. So 
they were happy to work with me. 
Aaron Paige (19:46): 
Where does your work take place? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (19:50): 
A lot has changed since COVID. Prior to COVID, we used to do a lot of community outreach. We would 
be at all of the community health fairs and everything like that. We had a very heavy presence in the 
community. We would go around and we would, if we were doing a Narcan training or a walk-in for 
patients to get into the program, we would be out in the community, up and down Main street, 
stopping in at the...What's it called? Mel's place, where people don't have place to stay. They can get 
food there and stuff like that. We'd walk in, talk to all the people sitting around in there, make 
conversation and even if they're not interested in our services, we'd like to let them know, "If you know, 
somebody that could benefit please put them in touch with us, we're happy to help." We had a really 
good community presence and did a lot of outreach. But since the pandemic, unfortunately, it's not 
what it was. But it looks like we're starting to be able to get more back into the community, which is 
great, because I love to be in the community. And like I said, back in the day, I liked to just walk up to 
people in the streets and just make connections that way. You never know, you know? 
Aaron Paige (21:03): 
Can you bring us into that a little bit more? I think that is, in some ways, the most powerful part of the 
job, that you are the interface with the community. So maybe if there are particular relationships that 
you generated from that outreach, that resulted from that outreach, or moments doing outreach that 
really stuck with you, particular events or... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (21:25): 
One of my favorite events we did, we were doing a Narcan training. It was some really fun community 
event they had going on and it was over by the city of Poughkeepsie police station, kind of on their lawn 
there. Me and another one of my coworkers were there for it, and it was in the evening, so I happened 
to have my children with me. And my daughter at the time had our little... we were Hudson River 
Healthcare before we became Sun River Health. And she had our little sign, and she was helping do our 
Narcan demonstration. And it was just, it was fun. It was really cute to get to be able to involve my kids 
into working with the community. I really enjoyed that experience that I got to have with them. So that 
was probably my most memorable one. 
Elinor Levy (22:15): 
So living and working in the same community, how often do you run into your clients? Do you call them 
clients or patients? 
Speaker 2 (22:23): 
Patients. Pretty regularly. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (22:28): 
Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (22:28): 
And I'm just curious, how do you... I worked in mental health for a while and it was always... I worked in 
a halfway house. It was between the mental health unit. And it was always like when we ran into them 
in public, we always had to wait to see what they did first, you know? We never said hello first. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (22:43): 
I won't approach someone unless it's someone that I know I can approach. Otherwise, people always 
come up to me and say, hello. Hello. Big hug. How you doing? It's great to see you. 
Elinor Levy (22:56): 
Yeah, we always waited for them to approach us in case they didn't want to. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (22:59): 
For me, it depends on the patient. If it's someone that I've previously known prior to my work that that I 
would say hi to anywhere, whether or not they were a patient of mine, then absolutely, I say hello to 
them, because, you know, even some of my patients are good friends with some of my other friends 
that will have kids together, so we'll show up at farmer's market, and my one friend will be having a play 
date with someone that I...So it's a very...it's a small community. A lot of people know each other. 
Elinor Levy (23:29): 
And in those cases, do sometimes your clients try to engage you outside of work? 
Speaker 2 (23:35): 
No, I've actually never had that happen. The most I've ever had happen though is our phone system can 
be a little difficult to sometimes get a hold of. So sometimes I will have somebody message me 
personally and they're like, "Hey, I'm having an issue trying to reschedule an appointment, or I'm 
running late. Can you please pass that info along? And, you know, no big deal. 
Elinor Levy (23:58): 
I'm a patient of Sun River as well. And yeah, getting... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (24:01): 
So you're familiar with our phones?, 
Elinor Levy (24:04): 
They say go through the portal, and then the portal doesn't work, and then they go to the phone, they 
get on the phone, go to the portal. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (24:10): 
So you know exactly what I'm talking about. 
Elinor Levy (24:12): 
Yeah. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (24:12): 
So yes. So if I happen to be at work, sitting on my computer and somebody is like, "Hey, you know, my 
script was supposed to be sent in, but it's not there at the pharmacy. I can't get through them on the 
phone." No problem. I just.... 
Elinor Levy (24:25): 
Yeah. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (24:25): 
I treat it as if they got through to me on the phone and I just send the encounter along. But I know how 
hard it is to get through to the phone system. Most of the people that do it, they don't bug me too much 
or anything. It's just, if they're really having a hard time getting a hold of what they need, they'll just use 
it as a way. 
Elinor Levy (24:47): 
If this ever happened, can you talk about a case where someone went a little too far? You know, 
misused you as part of the system, and how did you handle that without losing them? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (25:03): 
I have one that used to reach out pretty often because she had a hard time getting ahold of her case 
manager. And eventually, we were all given work cell phones when the pandemic hit, because prior to 
that, we didn't have them. You had to call and you had to go through, and the whole telephone relay. 
But once the case managers got their own work phone, they were able to directly contact their case 
manager and didn't have to be like, "Hey, I need to get ahold of my case manager. Can you just tell them 
to call me?" So that was... 
Elinor Levy (25:31): 
So you have a separate...you have a personal cell and a work cell? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (25:34): 
We didn't have the work cell phones prior to the pandemic, really. It was very only like a select few 
people had a work phone. 
Elinor Levy (25:43): 
Well that does help keep that work life boundary very carefully maintained 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (25:48): 
Yes... 
Elinor Levy (25:49): 
It's harder to maintain that when you're carrying the... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (25:52): 
Yes. But yeah, that was probably the most I had, was this one that really struggled to get ahold of her 
case manager pretty frequently. But once her case manager had the work phone provided, she was able 
to just directly message her herself. But I understand it, being a patient of Sunriver Health myself, it's 
really hard to get through on the phone. So I'll text one of my coworkers "Can you send a refill request, 
please? I can't get through to anybody." 
Elinor Levy (26:19): 
Or CVS, which only sends them through fax... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (26:22): 
It doesn't work! It doesn't work. 
Elinor Levy (26:24): 
And I'm always constantly... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (26:25): 
I use CVS too. It doesn't work. It doesn't, I don't know why. 
Elinor Levy (26:31): 
Yeah. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (26:31): 
But with CVS, you can't have the automated refill get faxed through. For some reason, it doesn't work. 
Elinor Levy (26:39): 
It doesn't seem like a problem, but it can be. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (26:43): 
There's four of us in our household. Between me, my husband, and my children, somebody's always due 
for a refill ,and it's just... 
Elinor Levy (26:52): 
Oh, and trying to get them to sync the refills. I have four of my five medications on sync and they 
won't... Because, I used to have to go back three times anyway. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (27:04): 
I understand. 
Elinor Levy (27:05): 
If it's irritating to us who have cars and the ability... And yeah, they do deliver, but then that means you 
also have to have a credit card. If you're someone who doesn't have a credit card and doesn't have a car, 
then this whole business of getting your medication... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (27:26): 
Yes. So that is something... 
Elinor Levy (27:27): 
At a CVS...or I imagine a Walgreens or anywhere else, really s ks. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (27:30): 
Right. We do run into a lot of issues with pharmacies. Some of them will, all of a sudden, decide to...I 
would say a majority of our patients are on Suboxone and sometimes the insurance company will say, 
"We're not gonna cover brand name. We're only gonna cover generic" And then you find the problem 
with the pharmacy the patients use don't have it in stock and don't have the means to necessarily travel 
somewhere, to find a pharmacy that has it in stock. 
Aaron Paige (27:55): 
Is patient navigation, kind of part of your job as well? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (28:01): 
As like? 
Aaron Paige (28:02): 
As in like... 
Elinor Levy (28:03): 
Taking them somewhere. 
Aaron Paige (28:03): 
Taking people places where they need to go... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (28:05): 
No. We don't necessarily have that ability, but we did at one point prior to the pandemic. We were 
working with Lexington, which had, I forget the name of... I want to say maybe the core program they 
had. They had grant funding where they were able to take patients to medical appointments. I had one 
of my MAT mommy patients who didn't have transportation, who was pregnant and needed a way to be 
able to get to and from her doctor's appointments. So we were able to link them with Core that we 
worked with..because we would do groups with Core. And one of the women from Core was able to 
transport our patient to the doctors for her appointment, for ultrasounds. So that was really helpful. But 
at this point in time, I'm unsure if that's even a possibility. Once again, COVID. 
Elinor Levy (28:53): 
Right, right. 
Aaron Paige (28:54): 
So you're out in the community doing outreach at fairs and on the street. Do you also do home visits? 
Do you meet with patients in their homes? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (29:06): 
No. That was something that had been talked about. But, I think COVID really put that way on the back 
burner. That was something that back when I was in Hep-C, we talked about doing. We would have a 
problem with patients being able to get transportation to come to the lab for blood draws. Medical 
transportation pretty much will only provide transportation to a medical appointment, a lab visit. They 
don't necessarily consider a medical appointment. So that was one of the things within the Hep C 
program, is we would like to have been able to go to someone's house to draw them. I don't know if 
they ever made that a reality or not. But that was something that we had talked about doing back in Hep 
C. Being able to go do draws, which I'm sure would benefit a lot of people, especially in more rural 
communities, because we're large. We're very large. 
Elinor Levy (30:05): 
And you are growing? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (30:06): 
Yes. We actually get a lot of people that are really quite a ways away from our facilities. But they like us 
and they want to stay with us. Thankfully, now that we have Tele-Med as an option, they're able to have 
the majority of their visits virtually. And if there is a lab near them that can have their labs drawn, leave 
a urine sample. We can pretty much not have them have to come down from wherever they are on-site. 
But some people, they'll do their videos visits, and then maybe once every three months they'll come in 
for a face-to-face, do lab work and everything. So we try to really offer multiple pathways. We meet you 
where you're at. That was always our thing. We meet people where they're at. We don't try to stuff 
everybody into... It's not a one-size-fits-all. Absolutely not. And that's one of the things I've always liked 
about our program, especially because my husband, who's been to many places and different doctors, 
and they were not that great. So I was always so supportive of this mission and everything, and very 
passionate about it because we really do try to do whatever we can to meet people where they're at, to 
help them. 
Aaron Paige (31:26): 
Thinking of an example of maybe a patient who was, just say, released from prison, and it's part of their 
parole maybe to... It could be part of someone's parole to also enter a treatment plan and to stay in it. 
How do you connect with that person? How does that relationship begin? How do you sustain it? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (31:52): 
Okay. 
Aaron Paige (31:53): 
Take us through like... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (31:53): 
So this is an interesting one, because up until fairly recently, parole, would not allow people to be on 
Medication Assisted Treatment. 
Aaron Paige (32:04): 
Mm. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (32:04): 
But thankfully, a lot of the arbitrary stigmatizing rules, even within corrections itself. Like now Dutchess 
County Jail, they will start you on methadone. They will start you on Suboxone. If you're interested in 
giving Vivitrol a shot before you leave, they'll give you your first Vivitrol injection. Dutchess County Jail 
has come a really, really long way. You used to go in there and they would give you an antihistamine, 
and like something else. If you were on Suboxone already, you couldn't continue it in there. So they've 
really come a long way with it. So, we get people that... It's fairly newer that we're getting them. But 
yeah, just trying to figure out if they're in parole housing, do they have stable housing? What is it they're 
interested in doing now that they're on parole? If they're mandated to groups, we've got to make sure 
that they're going to their groups and that the groups are a good fit for them. 
Aaron Paige (33:12): 
And is that all happening by phone or, telemedicine, like virtual? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (33:19): 
I used to be face to face. So I have to say I really miss being in the office. I would go in the room with the 
provider, most of the time. So we would all kind of have a discussion, you know? Provider would cover 
more of the medical aspects. From there, I would kind of be like, "Okay, you know, what's going on? You 
know, with the rest of you, with the rest of your life?" And we all worked as a team. So we were a very 
integral, hands-on team where you had assistance from so many different people. 
Aaron Paige (33:49): 
So the provider in that case is probably dealing mainly with the medical issue. And then you're thinking 
about, and dealing with the other social determinants of that person's health. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (33:57): 
Right. 
Aaron Paige (33:58): 
That sort of how it's... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (33:59): 
Right. We would all kind of work together. Because we've had patients that, for one example, the 
patient was staying at the shelter, and they were constantly getting beat up and robbed of their 
medication. And unfortunately, we had to try to figure out a way for this patient be able to have 
medication, but not, you know, constantly be having it stolen. We would send a week's medication at a 
time for them. So that way, they weren't having so much on them at a time. So... 
Elinor Levy (34:36): 
And you can read things when you're face to face...and we've experienced that. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (34:39): 
It was much, much easier working with patients face-to-face and creating that good rapport. And then 
being able to work better with them. Now that it's not so much like that, it's really a lot harder. Like the 
patients that I acquired during COVID, where I'm just calling them out of the blue, they have no idea 
who I am, were a lot less receptive to wanting additional help, additional services. Who are you? 
Whereas the ones that I had prior to that, call them up every time. "Oh, it's so great to hear from you. 
Thanks for calling. Thanks for checking in." Much more willingness to work with us, as opposed to the 
ones that have no... They see the doctor on the video and then they have no idea why these other 
people keep calling them, and who are they? Whereas when we would get a new patient in the office, 
we would all go in and introduce ourselves. "This is your team. We're all here for you." It's looking like 
it's working its way back to where we're having more in office visits, less Telehealth visits. We can build 
those rapports back with people to be able to help them more. 
Elinor Levy (35:57): 
So I know when we were chatting before we started the interview that you're going to nursing school, 
you hope to go into nursing school. How do you think your work with MAT is going to inform your 
nursing? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (36:12): 
One of the options I am considering for doing in nursing is working in a detox or a rehab, since I happen 
to be pretty well versed on the process and I really enjoy working with people that are going through 
that. Because I found a lot from personal experience and such that people in the medical community 
can be judgmental a-holes and disrespectful and stigmatizing. And God forbid, if you have something in 
your chart that they don't like, they treat you like a second class citizen. I want to be...I remember the 
woman Dr. Kelly Ramsey. She was the first person that treated not only my husband, but myself, like 
human beings. And I remember that was the first person that treated us like people. And I said, 
"Someday, I would like to, hopefully not be somebody's first, but if somebody's used to being 
stigmatized, I'm going to make sure that they have somebody that treats them like a human being." So 
yeah. Pay it forward, I guess. 
Aaron Paige (37:21): 
I think that maybe that's where the relationship that you have with your husband is so important. In 
terms of your relationship to the patients that you have, in that there is so much stigma around 
addiction of various kinds of drug use and alcohol abuse. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (37:43): 
Alcohol use disorders are so prevalent. People don't even realize half the time that what they're doing is 
absolutely an alcohol use disorder. People think that they're not an alcoholic, if they're not buying...I 
don't know anything about alcohol, but like one of those big... Like a big thing of vodka. They're like, 
"Well I'm not drinking the whole hour. I don't drink in the morning." 
Aaron Paige (38:06): 
Right. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (38:06): 
But it's like, "Well you drink three times a week. And when you do you drink a 12 pack." That's kind of 
like episodic binge drinking, you know? 
Elinor Levy (38:13): 
Or why do you drink? Back in the day when I used to drink, and now I don't drink because of 
medications I take, I did drink before I went to bed so I could sleep. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (38:24): 
Right! 
Elinor Levy (38:25): 
And then I realized, "Well, that's probably not really a good idea." 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (38:27): 
Yeah! 
Elinor Levy (38:27): 
So I switched to Benadryl, which is probably also not a really good idea, but... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (38:31): 
Well, Benadryl is safer in terms of developing a physical dependency to it. So sometimes, you want to 
just find the harm reduction. 
Elinor Levy (38:39): 
Right. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (38:39): 
So that's another thing, we do not preach abstinence at all. If your goal is to be abstinent from 
everything, fantastic. We'll support you in that. But if you, let's say, you're drinking really heavily, but 
you use crack sometimes, and you're not interested in discontinuing that, but you really want to focus 
on the drinking because that's causing a problem. Absolutely fine. Not a problem. We want to work with 
what you want. We're not gonna force... Because unfortunately, AA and NA used to give our patients a 
harder time because they didn't believe that people that were on MAT were quote unquote sober. So 
our patients would feel really stigmatized and bad about themselves for going to the AA and NA 
meetings. We used to tell them, "Just don't disclose that you're on the medication." 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (39:26): 
I feel like even AA and NA is starting to turn a corner and realize that abstinence only doesn't have 
anywhere near as high a success rate as somebody that enters with a recovery with Medication Assisted 
Treatment. Studies have been shown where the longer someone remains on MAT, the higher chance 
they have of maintaining long-term recovery. Versus somebody that goes to a detox for three to five 
days and comes out and is not on any medication has a significantly higher chance of relapsing than 
somebody that is on some form of medication for their substance use disorder. 
Elinor Levy (40:07): 
And unless AA model has changed significantly, I feel it can be a wrong model for women. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (40:14): 
I've never been to an AA or NA meeting. So, I don't know. I just know what people have told me about 
how they were treated at them. 
Elinor Levy (40:21): 
I just know that the concept of giving yourself up to a higher power can be very damaging for women 
coming out of domestic abuse. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (40:32): 
That's totally understandable. I personally think that you shouldn't have to give anybody power; that it's 
you. That it's going to come from within, that you're the one that's going make the change in your life 
Elinor Levy (40:43): 
Not to say, it hasn't helped millions of millions of people. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (40:45): 
It does. Yes. But you shouldn't feel like the only way that you can remain sober is somebody else's 
power. Like no, believe in yourself. 
Elinor Levy (40:53): 
And I just think the popularity of it has made it the dominant one. But I remember working in mental 
health and a lot of our clients, we called them clients, smoked. And we would get interns coming in from 
the universities, because we were in university of California Davis. "Shouldn't we address their 
smoking?" And we'd all just start laughing. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (41:14): 
Yeah. yep. No. 
Elinor Levy (41:15): 
It's like, "No, no, no, no." 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (41:17): 
Please let them have their cigarette. 
Elinor Levy (41:19): 
Yeah, please let them. Yeah. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (41:20): 
Let them. 
Elinor Levy (41:20): 
And then the city of Davis enacted the toughest smoking laws in the country, and our people would be 
getting cited, like hundreds of dollars for smoking two feet away from the right place to smoke. It was 
crazy. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (41:40): 
Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (41:40): 
It was crazy. but smoking calms. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (41:42): 
That's a very good point to bring up. So we feel like if you try to take everything that brings somebody 
joy away from them at the same time, you're going to be creating a really miserable person. 
Elinor Levy (41:54): 
Yeah. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (41:54): 
And you know, that's... 
Elinor Levy (41:55): 
And they're not going to want to do any of it. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (41:55): 
But there's plenty of people who enter into recovery. They get stable in recovery, and then they come to 
us and say, "Hey, I'm ready to quit smoking. Let's do it." 
Elinor Levy (42:04): 
Right. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (42:04): 
And those are the ones that tend to be more successful than the ones that are just told that they can't 
do anything anymore. 
Elinor Levy (42:12): 
Right, right. 
Aaron Paige (42:14): 
I have question, we've asked this of several people. As a peer outreach worker, what's one of the 
greatest difficulties of the job, working in the MAP program, for example? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (42:28): 
I wouldn't really say difficulties, other than sometimes you run into red tape with things. Kind of like 
gray area things. Or you want to be able to help more than you technically can. For instance, somebody 
has a crisis and you want to try to do something to benefit them. Like, you know, what are we allowed 
to do and what are we not allowed to do? So sometimes... 
Aaron Paige (42:54): 
The gray areas can be very interesting areas. Could you bring us into a gray area experience that you 
had? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (43:01): 
I would say, if you have a patient that has a baby and they don't necessarily have the things that they 
need for. Where is the boundary, "Is it okay if we give them secondhand stuff, or are we allowed to go 
out and get them a couple things?" It's stuff like that. Circumstances where you would like to be able to 
provide help, but you're really not...Kind of clear with what's exactly truly acceptable and what's not. 
But we did one time. When we had groups and we had an actual MAT mommies group that we did with 
the Core program from Lexington, they worked with us on that. We did hold a little baby shower for 
them at the end. Just some diapers and wipes and whatever. 
Elinor Levy (43:51): 
Probably less gray area, because it was for the group. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (43:53): 
Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (43:53): 
As opposed to... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (43:54): 
And we acquired things via donation. 
Elinor Levy (43:57): 
Right. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (43:58): 
But there's only so much you can do, and sometimes you want to be able to do more and you can't. So 
for me, that's something that I find tough. 
Elinor Levy (44:12): 
I'm going to ask this question, but you're absolutely welcome to say "I'm not gonna answer it." 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (44:18): 
Okay. 
Elinor Levy (44:18): 
Have you ever lost a patient? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (44:20): 
Passed away? 
Elinor Levy (44:21): 
Yeah. Or who left the program and completely... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (44:26): 
One year for international overdose day, which happens to be on my birthday, August 31st, 
international overdose day. One year we made a wall, and we put a bunch of only first names. We put 
some of our patients that had passed away on there. So yes. I had one girl that I was working with, and 
she was probably around my age, maybe a couple years younger, and she was super motivated. She was 
doing super well. She had gone to a rehab and didn't necessarily want to continue on the medication. 
Very shortly after, she relapsed and passed away, and that was very sad. We've definitely had too many 
overdose deaths. We hold community Narcan training events. We hold internal Narcan training events. 
We try to give Narcan out everywhere we can. We've now been able to acquire fentanyl test kits. So, 
we're always happy to get those into the community as well, and encourage people that whatever it is 
you are using, test it. Absolutely, because fentanyl is in so many things that you might think...for 
instance, you're gonna do a little cocaine, but it could be cut with fentanyl. Having not used any thing 
like that, it could be fatal. So we really just try to encourage a true harm reduction approach where, 
especially our patients that we know still like to dabble with stuff and everything, we are always just like, 
"Totally fine, just please test your stuff, just please be safe. Have Narcan." 
Elinor Levy (46:12): 
It's been around for a while, but that's such a shift in thinking in my lifetime. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (46:20): 
Even in my lifetime. Because when I first started with harm reduction back at the Harm Reduction 
Coalition, everybody thought we were crazy and that you're not helping people by encouraging them. 
They would always say we're encouraging drug use, and we're not. These people are going to use 
anyway. The difference is we're giving them clean and sterile equipment, teaching them proper ways to 
do it. We are reducing harm. We are preventing the spread of HIV, preventing the spread of Hep C. 
Aaron Paige (46:49): 
Right. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (46:49): 
We would never force anything on anybody, but we would always let them know, "Hey, if you want to 
get linked to treatment, or if you want to get linked for healthcare, Hep C, HIV testing, we can help you 
guys with that." So, it took a long time for the rest of the world to finally start to get their wheels turning 
that harm reduction is not encouraging drug use. It's reducing the harm from using drugs. 
Elinor Levy (47:15): 
And setting them on a potential pathway. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (47:17): 
Right. That way, they know that there are things available if, and when, they're ready for them. And 
people would all the time be like, "Can I get tested for this or that?" Or they'd be like, "I think I'd like to 
maybe get in the methadone program, can you help with a referral for that?" 
Elinor Levy (47:37): 
What's the largest age group that you see? Like 18 to 20, 30 to 40? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (47:49): 
We have all ages. Unfortunately, we do not take adolescents, last I knew. I've seen the shift as the 
population aged. I'm going to say mid-twenties to late thirties is probably the most predominant that we 
see now. 
Aaron Paige (48:15): 
And for what kind of use specifically? Or just... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (48:18): 
Opioid use disorder. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (48:20): 
I feel like alcohol use disorders, the patients we see are slightly older, like late thirties, early forties, even 
fifties. We have a lot for alcohol use disorder 
Elinor Levy (48:29): 
And what's the percentage that are male to female? Or I should say, male to female to non binary? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (48:37): 
I'd say that it's pretty equal. It's not necessarily one dominant over the other. It's pretty equal. 
Elinor Levy (48:46): 
And what about veterans? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (48:48): 
That's a good question. I don't necessarily know too many offhand that are veterans. I want to say it's 
more of our older population that would be typically veterans. I've seen a couple though that have had 
military insurance. But they're very few and far between. 
Elinor Levy (49:07): 
That's right. Because they would be able to supposedly get help at the Vet Hospital. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (49:12): 
Right. I know it's the Tricare insurance, and I don't see that very often. I've seen it three or four times. 
Aaron Paige (49:26): 
I was just wondering about your patients and whether you partner with patients in your outreach 
efforts? So sometimes patients, if they're users, might be in a community of users. Do you work with 
them to enter those communities? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (49:47): 
We don't even have to. They tell all their friends about us. Oh my gosh, you should...Everybody says, 
"I've heard so much wonderful things about this doctor." Everybody that comes in, "Like my friend told 
me, my cousin told me, my mom told me." We have so many people that have come into our program, 
just word of mouth. It's amazing the amount of word of mouth that we've gotten. 
Aaron Paige (50:13): 
Wow. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (50:13): 
We've definitely grown due to the patients that have been very happy with our treatment. 
Elinor Levy (50:23): 
Does the MAT program exist just here in Dutchess County, or are there branches, or does it exist 
everywhere? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (50:32): 
So not every site has its own MAT providers. Initially, it started with our Poughkeepsie site. We used to 
be over at the Atrium. And it's grown to expand because a lot of it was grant based. In order to have an 
MAT doctor, nurses, and everything, we had to get grant funding. We made it down to Suffolk. We 
developed a large program down there...Peekskill Beacon. We got up to Hudson. And now, more 
recently with our program, we have been integrating primary care doctors to be able to prescribe MAT. 
So they no longer have to go to a site that has a specific department for it. So some of our smaller 
offices, like Amenia, for example the general doctor that sees little kids to geriatric, they can provide 
MAT medications to the patients. 
Elinor Levy (51:36): 
But after they've signed up through you? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (51:39): 
No. So the way it works to be able to prescribe them is there's something called an X waiver that the 
providers have to take. I think it's eight hours for MDs, and I believe it's 24 hours for NPs and PAs to be 
able to be qualified to prescribe buprenorphine. But as long as someone has that waiver they can 
prescribe it. So we have from our infectious disease Hep C HIV department, one of our providers, she's 
got the waiver. So for her HIV and Hep C patients, she'll just prescribe their MAT as well. So we're really 
trying to not keep it as one thing and make it everywhere, offered everywhere, available to everybody. 
Elinor Levy (52:22): 
I think that's great for people who are in remote areas, but then I worry that they're not getting the 
benefit of the full MAT program and the other services that you provide with that. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (52:35): 
So there are ways around that. They all do have to have a case conference to go over their patients 
initially, and then annually. And if they do have a patient that does require needs, like for instance, 
Hudson. Our Hudson site has a primary care provider that does MAT, and if they have a patient that they 
need assistance with, they'll contact somebody from say, Poughkeepsie. 
Aaron Paige (52:59): 
Okay. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (52:59): 
So we all kind of work as an even larger team.It's like less localized and just more...you could reach out 
to somebody in Long Island for help. 
Aaron Paige (53:10): 
So what is your service region? It sounds like maybe it's expanded over the years. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (53:14): 
Yes. So primarily I'm 75 Washington street, but I will help out with any facility that needs it. I do help out 
Hudson a lot, because it's a very tiny office in Hudson. And so I'll help them with their intakes, mostly if 
they need somebody to do an intake. Mostly I'll do their intakes for them, or I'll assist with us getting a 
patient into a rehab facility that's in Hudson that wants to go to a rehab. So I do try to assist some of the 
smaller sites that need help when they need it. They know they can reach out to me. If I have resources 
in their area, that I'm able to provide them with, I will. If not, I find somebody that can and have them 
help them. Teamwork. A lot of teamwork. 
Aaron Paige (54:00): 
I'm not so sure about opioid use but alcohol use, we've learned from conversations with migrant 
farmworkers, outreach workers, is not uncommon among the migrant farmworker population. As a peer 
for the MAT program do you also serve that population? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (54:30): 
Our Sun River health facility as a whole, for primary care and preventative care, I know they work a lot 
with the migrant farmworkers. I personally, being in Poughkeepsie, haven't seen too many necessarily. 
Out in more of the rural areas or down towards Long Island, or maybe out by Monticello, they might 
have more experience working with that population. But me being based in Poughkeepsie, I mostly get 
more of the... 
Elinor Levy (55:03): 
And because you said you work with certain insurance... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (55:07): 
Well that's for case management. In order to get a health homes case manager you have to have those 
kind of insurances. 
Aaron Paige (55:14): 
And you're actually filling the gaps there. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (55:16): 
Yes. Yes. We try to use other staff to help fill gaps where we need them with other things. We're all 
multitaskers. 
Elinor Levy (55:26): 
Yeah. I would imagine that alcohol is easier to get. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (55:31): 
It's cheap. 
Elinor Levy (55:31): 
Cheaper, easier to get, it's legal. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (55:34): 
Readily available. 
Elinor Levy (55:36): 
I'm sure if they were to be caught using,... Well, I guess marijuana doesn't matter anymore. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (55:43): 
That is legal now, yep. 
Elinor Levy (55:44): 
Yeah. I had a funny experience on Sunday with that. But if they're caught with anything that's illegal, 
that's the end of their ability to work in the U.S. So... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (55:54): 
Right. 
Elinor Levy (55:54): 
And also I think culturally... 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (55:56): 
Culturally, that's what I was gonna say too. I don't think that's necessarily as prevalent culturally. But we 
do treat people for alcohol use disorder, but that is not a majority of our population at all. Primarily, 
most of our patients are opioid use disorder or co-occurring mental health disorders, and a co-occurring 
substance use disorder with opioid use disorder as the primary. So that's primarily the population that 
we get. But I think that's also demographically for where we are. 
Aaron Paige (56:27): 
You know the demographics of this area pretty well. I don't know this area so well. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (56:35): 
Where are you from? 
Aaron Paige (56:36): 
I live down in the city, New York City and then I work in Westchester and Rockland. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (56:41): 
Where in Westchester do you work? 
Aaron Paige (56:43): 
White Plains. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (56:43): 
Are you familiar with Peekskill? 
Aaron Paige (56:45): 
Oh yeah. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (56:46): 
It's pretty much just North Peekskill. You have an inner city, more urban population.Than you have the 
surrounding outer areas. That's like the Cortland and stuff around Peekskill. And then as you branch out 
a little more, it gets a little more sparse. It's a very similar demographic to...I would compare it to 
Peekskill. 
Elinor Levy (57:08): 
Yeah. Except the Peekskill downtown is more bougie than our downtown. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (57:15): 
And it's getting gentrified. Beacon has. 
Elinor Levy (57:15): 
Yeah. Tragically for those of us who are trying to live downtown. 
Aaron Paige (57:23): 
So that would mean there'd be a relatively large Spanish speaking population. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (57:27): 
Oh yeah. 
Elinor Levy (57:29): 
It has the largest population of Oaxacans outside of Oaxaca. 
Aaron Paige (57:33): 
So as a peer, how do you engage that population? 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (57:38): 
So, because primarily we have opioid use disorder, the majority of our patients do speak English. I want 
to say we have a slightly majority of Caucasian patients for our MAT program in Poughkeepsie. We have 
large population of that. We do have plenty of Spanish speaking staff. Surprisingly, we have a ton of 
bilingual staff. 
Elinor Levy (58:09): 
Just at 75 Washington street alone. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (58:11): 
Oh yeah. Tons, tons of bilingual staff, it's wonderful. If, for instance, if somebody passes me in intake 
and the patient only speaks Spanish, one of my coworkers, a case manager that I've sat next to for years, 
I just turn over to him and I say, "Can you do an intake in Spanish for me?" "Not a problem." And I'll, in 
turn be like, "Hey, just send me one that you get and I'll make it up for you." But we are very lucky to 
have a very multiculturally diverse staff. 
Speaker 1 (58:48): 
I think I'm... Thank you so much. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (58:51): 
You're welcome. 
Aaron Paige (58:52): 
Thank you. 
Elinor Levy (58:52): 
I'm going to turn this off now. 
Bridgetlee Goldstein (58:55): 
My pleasure.
