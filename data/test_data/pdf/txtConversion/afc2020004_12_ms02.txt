[Elise Paschen reads “Heritage, X”] 
 
Elise Paschen:  This poem is the tenth of interlocking poems in a book-length project called 
Heritage. In this long poem sequence, I attempt to delve into my Tallchief family history and 
follow the story trails of my Osage ancestors.  
 
In the 1920’s my grandmother Tallchief gave birth to her three children during a horrific period 
of American history called The Reign of Terror, when outsiders murdered the Osage for their 
headrights. During this time, because of oil under their land, the Osage were considered one of 
the wealthiest people in the world. 
 
My mother, Maria Tallchief, was born in 1925 on the Osage reservation. Growing up, I would 
visit my grandmother Tallchief in Fairfax every summer. Although I was born and raised in 
Chicago, I see Fairfax as a genius loci for my work. 
 
This poem is an homage to the Tallchief women in our family, beginning with my great 
grandmother, Eliza Bigheart Tall Chief. Our story lives on.
