PLACE, 
BANJO SOLO, BY GUS T. WALLACE. 
Kind friends, your attention, I'm going to sing a 
song, 
It's only kind a 
simple, and it won't detain you long; 
It's about a 
little yeller girl T 
met de oder day, 
As I 
was promenading down Broadway. 
Her Iltee was Iltt and her nose was flat, 
And the greasy sweat it run down over her big 
black face, 
My soul, I 
thought I'd bust myself a 
laughing, 
When I 
saw her skip the gutter, 
You'd have done the same if you'd been in my place. 
Her mouth was just as putty as a 
big gash in a 
ham, 
She didn't look consumptive and her name was 
Alakersam, 
You bet she struck me for a 
geezer, -with a 
style 
that was immense, 
I 
never shall forget her till I 
die. 
Every time she would cough all her hair would 
come off, 
, And when she'd blow her nose it sounded 
like a 
B 
flat basson, 
I 
should have liked her better if the weather 
hadn't been so warm, 
You'd have done the same if yor.'d been in my place.

Ise wandered back to de ole plantation, 
Where many happy days I 
have seen; 
My head is bowed while in meditation, 
De past to me it seems just like a 
dream. 
Though de sun shines just as bright as eber, 
And de birds sing sweetly as before, 
I 
miss de imiles and voices of dem loved ones, 
Who made me happy in dem days of yore. 
CHORUS. 
Dem days dat's gone dey now rise up before me, 
Faces bright dat I 
shall see no more, 
Hover round me while sweet voices whisper, 
" 
Waiting for you on de golden shorc." 
De huts upon de lawn are all forsaken, 
Though de woodbine clusters round dem still, 
Death away ole massa it has taken, 
He sleeps among de trees upon de hill, 
All de beauty from my home has faded, 
Lonely and dejected I 
remain, 
In vain I 
wait to hear dear voices saying, 
Dis poor ole man is welcome home again,

WALLA*C9S COURTSHIP, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY GUS T. WALLACE 
I'll sing about a 
daisy who I 
met the other day, 
She roped me for a 
sucker and took my stamp; 
She played me for a 
gilly and every uickle 
I 
was worth 
And then she threw me out just like a 
tramp.. 
She robbed me of my ulster, as I 
hocked it 
for a 
dim 
To buy her a 
drink of rock and rye one day, 
And after I 
had treated her in this splendid style. 
She,weut off with an organ grinder and run away. 
Cnoltus. 
She was lazy,- she was crazy, 
She was slouchy and a 
buw, 
'Twould t 
ke a 
caneon ball for to break her ganl, 
And yer bet she took the cheese for chewing gum 
Dis girl she was a 
lusher, 
She was always on the booze, 
To see her drink cheap gin Would make yer sick, 
Her nose was always blooming ' was as red 
as any rose, 
And her hair it was the color of a 
brick, 
Yer should see her walk the tight rope, 
Or balance on her ear, 
Or do a 
juggling act with any clown, 
She can turn a 
o.ouble flip flap in a 
break neck 
song and dance, 
As well as any ham fat in the town. 
Chorus. 
Dis girl she is a 
fighter, as a 
slugger she's the boss. 
She can beat Paddy Ryan almost any day, 
She can wrestle like a 
majot and never get a 
toss, 
She is just limber as a 
bale of hay. 
She never wears silk stockings 
Till her toes are sticking out, 
Her face would make a 
splended eight day clock, 
I 
lived on cold wind pudding all the time 
I 
courted her, 
And for breakfast used to run around the block. 
Chorus.

For it brings back sweet visions of my childhood, 
In scenes of brightness that my heart enfold.

This book my mother used to love, 
She gave is to me with tender blessings, 
Resting upon it from above.

Bright eyes they are glancing, 
To me they're so entrancing, 
Filling my heart with jcy.

Come, love, one more dance, 
Just one waltz with me; 
Sweetest music it enchants 
As we glide so gracefully. 
Happy hearts and smilling face% 
One meets everywhere, 
Dancing in the dreamy waltz, 
Nothing with it can compare. 
Cares and sorrows are forgotten, - 
While the hours are fleeting by. 
Arm in arm while we are dancing, 
Cupid steals in on the sly. 
Bright eyes they are glancing, 
To the music so entrancing, 
Filling my heart with joy.

The gospel train am coming, 
I 
hear her dos, at hand; 
I 
hear dem car wheels rolling, 
And a 
rumbling through de land. 
I 
hear de bell and whistle, 
It's coming round de curve, 
It's straining every muscle, 
And a 
busting every nerve. 
CHORUS. 
Den get on board, little children, 
Get on board, little children, 
Get on board little children, 
Dere's room for many ii.ore. 
Ws nearing now de station, 
Oh ! sinners don't be vain; 
But come and get 
On tickets, 
I 
Get ready for de train. 
I

little halt, 
And stop upon the line, 
I
Altd give you all a 
chance to go, 
But she will make her time. 
ITO signal for another train, 
To follow on this line; 
Oh! sinner's you're for ever lost, 
If you get left behind. 
The fare am cheap and all can go, 
The rich the poor am there,

No difference in the titre.

'The old fashioned cottage, the place I 
loved so well, 
The spot where my mother and my father used to dwell. 
Oh! how often I 
have strolled thro' the fields of 
growing corn, 
Near the old fashioned cottage, the place I 
was born. 
I 
remember the garden, the grove and the mill, 
And the little frame school house that stood on the hilt 
_But with all its surroundings I 
loved none so well,

Once used to dwell. 
CHORUS. 
The old fashioned cottage, the place I 
was born, 
3Iy home once so happy, has grown so forlorn, 
-flow I 
long to return to the home I 
love so well, 
The old fashioned cottage where I 
once used to dwell. 
long to return to the cottage once again, 
To think of it fills my heart with sorrow and with pain, 
Alany years now have passed since I 
left 
my dear old home,

The spot has grown lonely that once was so bright, 
Where oft mother kissed her dear children good-nig 
Oh 1 
how merry the birds sang their sweet songs 
of yore, 
As they peruh'd on the maple near the old cottage dove.

GARFIELD'S GRAVE. 
TO THE CITIZ ENS Or CLEVIMAND, DEM, 
With steady step, and muffled drum, 
The cortege passed along; 
And dreaded silence reigned supremo 
Amid the mighty throng. 
The somber tolling of the bells, 
Reminded us in time we must 
Just like our President: 
Return from dust to dust. 
Men with heads uncovered, 
Would mutter Guitan's nexae; 
And the wishes of each one, 
am certain were the same. 
And if from jail he once were free, 
No power on earth could save 
The man that sent our President 
To iiii untimely grave. 
We saw the streas in mourning, 
Which ever way von would go; 
And every one their sympathy 
In some way ttiett to show. 
Many a 
wife and mother, 
A 
fervent prayer has said, 
And taught it to their little ones 
Before they went to bed. 
And v: lien the sufferer was laid 
In his last resting place, 
Then c4le._ an aged colored man, 
With the tears running down his faoq, 
He bought a 
little bouquet, 
With a 
card marked Uncle Dave, 
He said it was all he had to give 
For faster Ganleld's grave. 
How sad it is, indeed, to see 
his patient hopeful wife, 
And and gray halved mother, 
For hini she would give her life, 
How different their feelings were, 
While about him they did stand; 
When honored with the highest place, 
There is in our free land. 
Let u:: Lope that his successor, 
Will be as fit to rule, and be a man 
That can't he made the politician's tool, 
So peaceful rest the ashes of our soldier, 
True and brave, and our nation's tears 
Will moist the earth on James A Garfield's Grave.

I've wandered all around, 
'Till I'm nearly broken down, 
And I 
have no place to rest my weary head, 
For to earn a 
scanty bite, 
I 
will work from day to night, 
And my response is hardship, scorn and bread. 
They will crush all my days, 
They will not let me raise, 
And they often call me scoundrel snare or scamp, 
All the world will on me frown, 
They will always crush me down, 
Because I'm nothing but a 
poor old tramp. 
They say I 
am all right, 
If I 
must sleep out all night, 
And go hungry through the day and night; 
And they say I 
am well off, 
If I 
go and sell my clothes, 
Though they will not let me have a 
word to say, 
I 
do not look for pleasure, 
For that I 
do not treasure, 
But how my suffering heart begins to fail, 
And they tell me after all, 
That it's all my fault, 
That I'm nothing but a 
poor old tramp. 
If the poor will join their hands 
In one united band, 
This country from tyrants we'll defend; 
If capital does well, 
• 
The poor may go to bell; 
For destruction it seems will be their end, 
And I 
think I'll see the day, 
And I 
hope they surely may, 
When the poor man will hold the brightest limp, 
And his body in the clay, 
Audi his soul has passed away, 
They can't term him as a 
poor old tramp.

OUR WORKINGMCNI 
BY LEW BAKER. 
BENG WITH IMMENSE SUCCESS, BY LEW Emmy. 
Rind friends if you listen, I'll sing you a 
song, 
And the facts now I'll tell to you, 
This world is a 
net-work that's not very strong, 
And catches us as we pass through. 
From the cares of temptation, 
There's no man that's free, 
But as many a 
man gains renown, 
And the way that they do it is easy to see. 
By keeping the workingman down. 
CHORITS. 
Then hold up your head if you have a 
will, 
Don't care for their sneers or their frowns, 
Stare fate in the face, if your heart's in the right place, 
For they can't keep the workingman down. 
Of course when you are working, your money 
you'll spend, 
Along with your comrades so gay; 
And before the week has come to an end, 
You'll find that it's all passed away. 
If you'll only put by a 
dollar or two, 
And place it in some bank in town, 
You could then wink your eye, tell the boss on the sly 
That they can't keep the workingman down. 
Chorus. 
You may take this here house, there's no impropriety, 
For to compare it that is my plan; 
The roof is the aristocrat, the walls the society, 
The foundation, the hard working man. 
If you take off the roof the walls still remain, 
Touch the walls the foundation's still sound, 
But touch the foundation, that's the hard working mall 
And the whole thing comes down to the ground.

O'Connell you know, as all history does show, 
Was a 
statesman; whose equal was few, 
At the great Parliament, he did Often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true. 
And Emmet the martyr, he fought for our cause, 
Like a 
laurel his name it keeps green, 
He died for his country and Liberty's laws, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen.

And never was known for to yield,

Where such brilliant genius has been, 
There was Grattan and Lover, and famous Torn Moore, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen.

But though those great men have now passed away, 
Old Erm shall not be alone, 
We have men that would die for their country to-day, 
And a 
parliament wish of their own; 
But may God guide and guard them to do what is right. 
May they harbor no rancor or spleen, '

And tell to me the very reason, 
Why I 
am slighted thus by thee. 
The sea is deep I 
cannot swim over, 
Neither have I 
the wings to fly, 
But I 
will hire some jolly sportsman, 
To carry o'er my love and I. 
I 
wish I 
had a 
glass of brandy, 
And this is the reason. I'll tell you why, 
Because when I 
am drinking, I 
am thinking, 
Does my true love remember rite.

STOOD IT LIKE A 
LAMB. 
AN ORIGINAL SONG, BY B. C. HART. 
AIR; GRIMES' CELLAR DOOR. 
Some people talk of bygone days, 
But we all do know, 
That things ain't as they used to be, 
Some twenty yeais ago. 
The girls used put me to bed, 
As happy as a 
clam, 
But still I 
don't care a

I 
stood it like a 
lamb. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! yes, those days, 
Those good old days, 
With me and Sarah Ann, 
When we slid down the cellar door, 
I 
stood it like a 
lamb. 
At last the days rolled quickly by, 
We both did older grow;

Sally and I 
did often play 
Hide and seek and lay low. 
She began to scare of me, 
As I 
grew to be a 
man, 
Says I, don't be frightened at me, dear, 
We'll stand it like a 
lamb. 
At last I 
am a 
married man, 
As happy as can be; 
The girls they don't come near me now, 
What's the reason I 
can't tell. 
I 
go around enjoy myself, 
Come home, say, here Jam; 
Ky wife don't squeal or say a 
word, 
She stands it like a

Oh ! love it is such a 
very funny thing, 
It catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
For many's the man's been sold. 
It will make you feel like a 
fresh-water eel, 
It will cause your heart for to 
You may love your wife as you do your life, 
But ' twill empty your pocket-book as well. 
So boys, keep away from the gill., I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You will find when you're wed, they'll bang 
you till you're dead, 
With the bawld-headed end of a 
broom. 
When a 
man's in love with a 
pretty little girl, 
He talks as gentle as a 
dove, 
He calls her his honey, and he spends lots of money, 
For to show her he's solid in love. 
When his money's all gone, and his clothes up 
the spout, 
He will find the old saying true, 
That a 
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, 
What the deuce is a 
fellow going to do. 
With a 
wife and fourteen half-starved kids, 
And tell you it ain't no tun. 
When the butcher comes around to collect his bills, 
With a 
dog and a 
double barrelled gun. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You'll think you are in clover, till the honey-
moon is own, 
And then you will wish you were'-dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
With a 
wife with a 
wart on her nose, 
You will find that love don't run so smooth, 
When you have to wear your second-hand clothes, 
When the rents are high the kids will cry, 
Kase they ain't got nothing for to claw, 
You'll holler for your son to load up the on, 
For to vaccinate your mother-in-low.

Once tilled with gladness and joy, 
Father will ne'er again answer my call, 
Or welcome his wandering boy. 
Aged and bending he sank to the grave, 
With prayers; on his lips for his son, 
Though in its mercy Heaven answered to wve, 
There's no one to welcome me home.

Everywhere darkness and gloom, 
Will ye.not come to me dear ones of old,

BE HOME EARLY TO- NIGHT, MY 
DEAR BOY, 
SHNG WITH GREAT SUCCESS DT MISS QUEEN ILETHERTON. 
AND LEW BAKER. 
I 
have traveled through life, I 
have seen many things, 
That surprised me in every form; 
I 
have been at the plow, I 
have been at the spade, 
'Till dark, and at sunrise in the morn. 
But at night I 
would go for some pleasure thro' town, 
I 
was always for pleasure and joy; 
My mother would say when going away, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
CHORUS. 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy; 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
One night I 
left home, and my poor mother was siek, 
In fever of torture and pain; 
he says, my dear boy, take the motto I 
give, 
I 
may not give it to you again. 
But when I 
returned from my night's fun and joy, 
- I 
heard my poor mother was dead. 
'Twas then a 
cold chill through my body did run, 
When I 
thought of the last words she said. 
Clio. 
All young men that are here, take a 
word of advice, 
To your father and mother attend; 
For a 
good mother's love it must not be forgot, 
When she's gone you've lost your best friend, 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
There are many things you can enjoy; 
Take the lesson I 
give'twas a 
mother's request, 
Keep good hours at night my dear boys. 
Chorus.

YOU ARE ALL THE WORLD TO ME 
LOU:SE, 
BY ALLEN J. 
McGill.. 
You are all the world to me, Louise, 
A 
pearl sweet and rare; 
The tint of the skies is seen in your eyes, 
The sunlight in your hair. 
You are my guiding star, Louise, 
The dearest that can be; 
My heart is thine, while life is mine 
You are all the world to me. 
CHORUS. 
You are my guiding star, Louise, 
The dtaarest that can be; 
My heart is thine, while life is mine, 
You are all the world to me. 
I 
never can forget, Louise, 
The merry days we've seen; 
Where floweret bloom their sweet perfume, 
Scent meadows fair and green. 
'Twas there that first we met Louise. 
Where birds sang merrily; 
Years faded away, yet since that day, 
You've been all the world to me. 
But we're no longer young, Louise, 
And silver shades the gold; 
My thoughts oft flow to the long ago, 
Where first my love I 
told; 
But you are just as dear, Louise. 
And just as fair to see; 
Though years have fled since first I 
said, 
You are all the world to me
