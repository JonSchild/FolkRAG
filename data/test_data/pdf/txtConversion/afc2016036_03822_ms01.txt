Laura Orleans: Today is February 10, in the year 2017 and this is an interview for the New 
Bedford Fishing Heritage Center funded by an Archie Green Fellowship by the Library of 
Congress. As part of this project we are interviewing shore side workers in the New 
Bedford/Fairhaven fishing industry to record their stories, document their skills and knowledge 
and better understand their important role in the fishing industry. The recording and transcript 
will become part of the permanent collection at the Library of Congress. I am Laura Orleans and 
today I am speaking with... 
John Pelicas: John Pelicas. 
LO: John Pelicas at R.A. Mitchell Company here in New Bedford and the time is approximately 
2:30 in the afternoon. So I will ask you to sign a formal release 
JP: Sure thing. 
LO: But for the record, do you give us permission to record you? 
JP: Absolutely 
LO: Excellent. All right, so I know we just said your name, but for the tape, would you just 
introduce yourself 
JP: Okay, I am John Pelicas. I'm 49 years old. I've been working at the R.A. Mitchel Company 
for 31 years. I started when I was 18 years old. Been doing this for a long time now. 
LO: Excellent. And when and where were you bom? 
JP: I was born in Portugal. Came the United States when I was 7, 8. And I've been, went to 
school here and I finished high school and started working at R. A. Mitchell. Had a couple of 
part time jobs, but nothing like this. What I do now. 
LO: So Portugal, mainland Portugal? 
JP: Yes. Alvide. I was bom there with my parents. They immigrated here and made a living and 
they raised me up in New Bedford, Mass., with the fishing industry. My dad was a fisherman, so 
that's how I got stuck. 
LO: And that actually was going to be my next question. So you're Portuguese and you come 
from a fishing family. 
JP: Absolutely. 
Lo: So your dad was fishing during the time that you were growing up? 
JP: Absolutely he was. 
LO: Did you spend anytime down on the waterfront and a young... 
JP: I've always spent all my time at the waterfront. Since I came to the United States, and I spent 
Interview with John Pelicas, Febmary 10, 2017

all my time at the waterfront and wanted to be a fisherman like my dad. And I went fishing when 
I was 10 and 11, back in the early 80's and I got sick and I said there must be a better living than 
being a fisherman, so I decided to become a mechanic because I was handy with my hands and 
thaf s where I've been. 
LO: I bet your mom was probably happy to have you on shore. 
JP: She was. And she didn't even know I had gone fishing. She was at work and she came home 
one day and asked, “Where's John? Oh, dad took him out fishing.” That's where I wanted to go, 
and I did, so it was quite the thing. 
LO: And so, when you were in school, where you in a regular high school or did you end up in a 
trade school? 
JP: Nope. A regular high school. But I did not want... I'm not very good with books, and stuff 
like that. So my mom said, as soon as you're done with high school, you can go in the working 
world. And that's what you want to do and that's what I did. And here I am. 
LO: How did you come to this company? Was this your very first job? 
JP: No. I worked in a machine shop that involved the fishing industry, but that was like a part- 
time job. I knew I didn't want to go to college, and I wanted a part time job that was a round the 
fishing industry. And that was it because it was close to my parents' house. Then I graduated and 
I wanted to become a mechanic and go on with my life and my dad is like, “hey, there's a great 
company down near the waterfront. If s the R.A. Mitchell. They’re nice. Do you want to see if 
you can get a job there?” And he knew Bob, so one Saturday I came down, did my application 
and he goes, "Did you finish high school?" I said, "Yeah." he goes, "Okay then. Then you're all 
good." And started the following Monday and haven't left. 
LO: So if s interesting. This is a story that I've heard many times, that people often know 
somebody. It's either family or a friend that they know. So do you think, the waterfront is very 
tight knit, that way, it seems. 
JP: Oh, very. I still have great friends. I know people in the waterfront. And as I was growing up, 
same thing, I had uncles, friends that were fishermen and kids my age were going out. And I’m 
like, I don't want that type of life. It's too rough for me. But I wanted to be around the waterfront. 
And thaf s how I became a mechanic. And thaf s all I did. 
LO: So tell me, you had the machine shop experience, a little. But then when you came here, 
how did you learn the job? 
[5:00] 
JP: Believe it or not, I had. Bob gave me an opportunity that most bosses wouldn't give, and 
knowledge, I took it in high school, you know little odds and ends, you know the basics. But I 
learned it all here, as growing up and having the right people teach you. You know, I did learn a 
little bit in school, but nothing hands on and working here, with my boss. Bob Mitchell's 
knowledge. His other workers, all the gentlemen that worked in here, they just passed it down to 
Interview with John Pelicas, February 10, 2017

US. I'm getting there too. I'm 50 now! I'm going to be 50! 
LO: So kind of on the job... 
IP: Training. Absolutely. We have a couple younger gentlemen that work with us. And that's 
what I'm trying to do, is pass that on to them, so they can become... We had a couple that went 
to school, you know, it's great with all the new electronic stuff that's out, and computers. But the 
basics and the hands on, if s great that people like myself, and other mechanics that we have 
teach them. 
LO: So, do you have a particular approach when you are trying to teach a new person some 
skills? 
IP: Oh, just, if s like, assembling engines, if s all, you know how we do it and keeping ever3dhing 
together. Kind of hard, they teach you that in school, but not the way it's done in a work 
environment. It's a little different. 
LO: So maybe that's a good place to start. Maybe take me, I don't know if there is a typical day 
here at R. A. Mitchell Company? But for you, what time does your day start and what happens? 
IP: Well, I start at R.A. Mitchell at 7:30 and we, at 4 o'clock we go home. But I take my job 
home all the time. I'm always thinking of what I'm doing the following day or what's going on in 
the shop as far as we fabricate a lot of new generator sets, so it's not just putting engines together 
or going down to a fishing boat. I mean, we sell generator sets all over the world. In Antarctica, 
Ibiza, put out product, we're everywhere. We're small, but at the same time. I'm proud to work in 
a company that we're able to do this and send our product out there to the world, and well- 
known. 
LO: So you arrive at 7:30. How do you know what you're going to do on that particular day? 
IP: Oh, my job, I could be in the shop assembling a generator, and then my boss could have a 
phone call and say there's a fishing boat down at one of our docks that needs to go out fishing 
and you need to go there and fix it. Or, you know, troubleshoot it see what's wrong. Or I could be 
going to New York or some, far away, doesn't matter. So, we don't have a specific job that we do 
every day and right now, that's why it's exciting, it's thrilling really that it's never the same thing 
twice. It’s always something different. Or I could be going to somebody's home and troubleshoot 
their generator at the house or fix it or install it. You know, if s, and thaf s what it is. 
LO: So, do you have a sense, of, do you enjoy the work on the boat more than the work on the 
shop, or ifs all... 
IP: Ifs all together. I love being on the boat. To me thafs a big satisfaction, to help a coworker 
with their problem, because thaf s what we are. We're problem solvers, you know, they only call 
is when the engine is broken. It's, you know, they become good friends also. What we do, is we 
go down there and it could be something as simple as a loose wire, you know something electric, 
or total overhaul on an engine where you know you got to take heads like when you blow a head 
gasket on a car or something like that and thaf s bigger. It's always different, so I don't have 
steady job where I do the same thing. It's not an assembly line. 
Interview with John Pelicas, February 10, 2017

LO: It's, I'm wondering about your Portuguese background. Do you speak Portuguese? 
IP: Yes, I do. 
LO: Is that useful? 
JO: Oh, it's great. It’s, there’s still a lot down at the waterfront, Portuguese community. They 
were big and they still are, but the new generation all speak English. The only thing that's 
horrible is the captains and their children, they do other jobs don't want to stick to the fishing 
industry, so family, thaf s kind of going away. People that I knew, but the new ones are coming 
in and they are great to work for too. If s just hard. The fishing industry is dying a little. 
[10:15] 
LO: So tell me about...Do you have a tool bag or, if you set out to go fix something, what do you 
bring with you? 
JP: Well, I have a little box, if s like a magical box. We have combination wrenches, screw¬ 
drivers hammers, and if s like our little magic box. We have it all with sockets. We have um, well 
my tool box weighs close to 80 pounds, so if s not a little box, but you can't... When your car 
breaks down, you bring it to the shop. We're the opposite. We go to the broken engines, so we 
got to have everything, so that's what I try to teach the young mechanics and stuff Before you go 
on the job, you have to do that job in your head and make sure that you have all the gaskets, all 
the material, all your tools, special tools that you might need. And when a customer calls, 
sometimes, they say if s one thing and you get there and if s totally opposite. So if s nice, if s 
exciting, it keeps you on your tippy toes. 
LO: Is there, I know that there's not a typical day. But is there a common job? Like what's the 
most common thing that you end up... 
JP: The most common thing that we do here is rebuild engines. We have a, it’s a little air cooled 
engine that we rebuild and they run, construction equipment, it's a screener. And, loam and stuff, 
it takes all the rocks and separates the rocks from the dirt and there's a bazillion of them out 
there. So we just overhaul them. So a customer will bring his old engine thaf s all beat up and 
time for a overhaul. And we just give him an overhaul, one that looks brand new. So we go 
through his, he doesn't have to stop working. He keeps on going, and thaf s like a fill-in between 
going out on a job. Thaf s pretty much what we consist. I build generators. So my job I come to 
work and my boss. Bob or Karen Mitchell, they give me, okay we sold a John Deere with a 65 
KWN and takes this you know a bunch of filters and whatever else, and I have to make frames 
and radiators and that's what I do. I do a lot of fabricating and I leave the overhauls to the other 
mechanics. I do the fabricating end of it. 
LO: So you've been here 31 years, what kind of changes have you seen with the equipment or in 
the industry? If s a big question. 
JP: Okay! It sure is, but equipment. The most is the electronic end on some of the engines. I 
thought there would be no way I would ever need a computer to go out on a job and fix a diesel 
engine. You know they're supposed to be bulletproof and you know, pretty much they are except 
Interview with John Pelicas, February 10, 2017 
7 
that little broken wire that came loose, the engine is not normal functioning, and you need a 
computer to plug in to tell you what it is. So that's the most common, and the most strange thing. 
But it's here and I got to work with it. And that took a little time for me to get adjusted to, which 
I'm still working at. And it's good though 
LO: And you kind of mentioned that the industry's gone down a little bit. Talk to me about 
changes you see in the fishing industry. 
JP: Oh boy. It's all the regulations thaf s coming down to the fishing industry. I mean. I'm always 
down at the waterfront, so I know a lot captains, a lot of people. And you know, when you hear a 
tragedy or something, I take it to heart, because I've been around so long. But the worst thing is 
all the regulations that they're coming down on these fishermen. They're making it so hard for 
them to make a living. It's bad enough they have to fight with the weather and not catching it, 
and the different equipment, different nets and all this different stuff, but them cutting the days. I 
remember back in the days, I used to go work on a boat, and the poor engine needed the 
overhaul, and you used to go, okay you fixed it, they used to go out fishing, come back and go 
out and see my boss and pay him for it. Now, I need money up front, because you never know if 
they're going to have a good trip or bad, you now. And they have more bad ones than good ones. 
They’re really struggling hard. And I feel bad because they're still a lot of working people there 
that need all these jobs. And ifs tough. 
[15:21] 
LO: So, I think people understand the dangers of being out at sea, is your job dangerous at all? 
JP: Oh, I think so, I mean, when I'm going on a boat now, and as I'm getting a little older, it's like 
when I go on a boat, I got to carry a tool box that weighs 80 pounds and I got to carry maybe 
another 100 pounds worth of parts to put on an engine, and it's like three, four boats out, and you 
got to climb and jump and go over all that, and as I'm getting a little older, my body doesn't take 
it as good. To me personally, getting to the inside of the engine room is the hardest. And once I 
get there and you're working, it's not too bad, but getting there sometimes is the worst because 
you got to pick everything from the truck, put it on one boat, bring it from one boat to the next, 
you've been there, so you know how that goes. It's not fun. 
LO: And especially, it’s one thing in August or September, but in January, February... 
JP: Oh yeah, I shore engineer for a few of my friends that own scallop boats, and they're doing 
good, those guys are doing real good. They're making a living and thaf s why our fishing industry 
is still floating, and doing good. But they're doing well, so they have homes in Florida and other, 
so they go out for the winter months, and they say, "John, will you take care of my boat" and I 
say, yeah. And like yesterday we had that big Northeastern, with all that snow, and me climbing 
inside of the boat to make sure the boat was okay, and my generators. You get nervous. You're 
calling the wife and say "Honey, I'm about to jump on a boat" and she’s like, "okay be careful!" 
and you go you do your thing and then you come back and you go "okay I made it" You know, 
so that way we know ifs good. Usually if there's somebody on the dock I'm always looking or 
waiting for each other to go. We keep an eye out for one another. Because I know all those 
Interview with John Pelicas, February 10, 2017 
8 
people. So it's like... Last year, me and this gentlemen, it was like perfect timing. We would wait 
for one another it worked out great 
LO: So are you usually working alone? 
JP: We go on jobs a lot, yes a lot alone. Only 90 percent if s alone but. I had my back done a 
couple of times, it fused and stuff, so my boss he gives me a helper all the time, so I thank him 
for that. And I'm able to go and still do what I do because of it. So it’s super. 
LO: Have you ever had any close call out there, going from boat to boat? 
JP: Yeah, you have where you slip and you hold on and jumping from one boat to another and 
you drop that $300 head in the water or more, and you're like oops! Or your tool box, which 
happens, but as long as its tools and materials, thaf s okay. I haven't done it. I've seen it happen, 
yes, you know like accidents and people fall in, but it hasn't happened to me thank God. 
LO: You know thaf s something I think most people don't appreciate, they don't know that part. 
JP: Yes. 
LO: So lef s see, we talked about tools. What do you enjoy most about the work? 
JP: Who me? At R.A. Mitchell? Believe it or not, is fabricating it’s like, I take, this is a small 
company and we build customized generators customized equipment and some people have ideas 
and it involves a generator engine to drive whatever they have in their brain or what the piece of 
equipment they want to build. So they come and talk to my boss, and he calls me, and take it 
from each other and read each other's minds and 99.9 we always succeed. So thaf s my favorite 
thing is putting stuff together and building equipment. That's my satisfaction. 
LO: Do you draw it out first? 
[19:47] 
JP: Believe it or not we still old school, we grab some soap stone which is like a chalk and we 
used to draw it on the floor. And we had, that's how I learned from an older gentleman that 
worked here. And Bob, my boss, and we usually sketch it out on the floor, on our working table 
and we go from there and then eventually the blueprints will come out, but 90 percent of the 
time, if s all in our heads and little piece of paper and we go from there. And thaf s how it works. 
LO: Can you think of any job that you've done that you are maybe a challenge that you 
overcame, or a job that you're especially proud of? 
JP: That was a few years back, maybe two, three years ago. Bob he sold a generator set for the 
city of New Bedford, a big 850KW. Its massive, if s a huge engine and it involved cutting a 40 
foot container and making it into a 30-footer and putting it on top of a 20 foot container that had 
the fuel tank on the bottom. You would need to see pictures of it. And it’s, that was the most 
amazing thing I've done so far in the company because it was like, taking it from his ideas and 
my idea and making this whole project work. And thaf s how we go. 
LO: Thaf s neat. And you mentioned before we turned the tape on, we were sort of joking that 
Interview with John Pelicas, February 10, 2017 
this was going to sort of go be preserved, you said something you actually do talk about this at 
the dinner table with the kids. 
JP: Oh we do, all the time. You know my kids always came to our Christmas parties and all our 
functions that we've had, summer parties and cookouts and so they know Bob very well and they 
come by and Bob's daughter’s the new future, and so we're always talking about jobs that I'm 
doing, and stuff that I do and houses that I go to. People, you know, yachts... 
LO: There's a sense of community... 
JP: Oh absolutely. It is. And if s like one day I might be working on a mega yacht, you know, 
worth millions, and then the next day I'll be on a poor little lobsterman guy thaf s just trying to 
make an honest living, struggling day by day. So yeah, thaf s the difference of the job that I do. 
One day I'll be wearing the almost like a suit to go work. The next day I got my scrubs. 
LO: Actually, that's a good question. Are there any special clothes that you wear? 
JP: We just have regular uniforms that we wear because of all the oil and grime. You don't want 
to throw that stuff in the washers at home. 
LO: Do you have gloves or anything like that? 
JP: We have gloves, safety equipment...all that. 
LO: Goggles? 
JP: Goggles, hard hats, vests that we, boots, steel-toe boots, which I had my feet broken because 
I had a big steel frame fall on them, 
LO: Oh, so it didn’t work? 
JP: No, thank god. I don't know it would have. I think it would have crushed them. It was so 
heavy, it just fractured all my toes. But I'm still here and going! 
LO: Wow! Okay, I asked about the thing you like the most. Is there a part of the job you, like, 
uh, "I got to do this!" 
JP: The worst, the worst is that bloody computer and plugging it in! And it’s because it’s like. 
I'm not that, I love the computers, I love the way the engines perform and ever3Thing, but they're 
so touchy nowadays, because of the computer systems. People's lives depend on this, and for this 
engine to be out there on a boat and malfunction or stop, in the average, you got to remember 
fishermen, they don't have the knowledge, they don't go to college, they don't have it. So for 
them to day, troubleshoot it, you need to plug in or scroll down through the board and find the 
problem, so I can...They don't know how. And you're out there, you don't want to, thaf s the least 
they want to do. 90 percent of the time it’s a little silly wire or sensor that goes bad, and their 
lives depend on that. So it’s not like old school where, you know, "oh your engine isn’t 
running?" they would grab a hammer and hit the damn thing and buckle in and make it home. 
Now, those days are over. But you got to go! Do it. Thaf s it. 
[24:49] 
Interview with John Pelicas, February 10, 2017

LO: Oh I know, I'm curious about the kinds of terms that you use, maybe to talk about the 
different types of jobs or different tools. You know, things that are unique to, you know like 
every job has its own language. And sometimes you have, like for example, when I was 
interviewing the guys down at Chris Electronics they were saying when the wires are all tangled 
up they call it Medusa's Hair. Or, uh, I can’t remember... 
JP: A rafs nest! Thaf s what I call it! Actually I just finished doing a... I'm actually working on it, 
I haven't finished but I'm going to go next week. A boat. He bought a generator and sure enough 
all the electrical, all the AC wires are all tangled and that was part of my thing, I told the owner 
that I was going to straighten it out. And That's what I did. We ripped all the wires of, ran them 
nicely, put them all nice and neat. I mean there is no regulation, so anybody can do wiring and all 
that. There is no inspections the way it should be, but it looks a lot nicer now. You want it to be 
trouble free. 
LO: But I can tell that you like what you do. 
JP: I love it. I don't like it; I love it. Thaf s why I'm still doing what I do. Not only is it a great 
company, the people that you work with they’re great. And I get a great feeling every time I go 
home and I've accomplished something. Oh I helped somebody. Thaf s my number one thing. 
When I go on a fishing boat, I always, and that's what I always try to tell the new generation is, 
people's lives depend on what you do. So don't cut any corners and if you're not sure, please ask. 
We have to be 110 percent all the time. You know like I'm going to go home, put my head down 
and feel comfortable that the job I did is 100 percent because if bad weather comes, the boat 
sinks, or something happens, if s like oh my gosh! Like I get all the fishermen that work down 
there, they all have my cell phone and my house number and they call me when they're out there 
and they're stuck and something breaks and I know their boats pretty good, so I'm able to guide 
them through problems and they come home and they're all excited. "Oh here, have some 
lobsters, have some scallops. That kind of stuff Like, yeah, it's a great feeling to, knowing that 
you've helped somebody and you do it so that they can make a living too. 
LO: And what's it like to have, you have Bob Mitchell as your boss, but as you said the future is 
Karen and Jen. Whaf s it like to have two women heading this company up? 
JP: You know something, in the beginning, like you know I've watched them grow up, so if s not 
like I didn't know, but they're the most wonderful people you could ever want working. My, 
Karen, she's a little spitfire, she's full of energy and so knowledgeable. She's going to be her dad 
in no time! And Jen, thank God for her! She gives me my paycheck every week! She's the book 
lady and she knows it too and she works in the parts and all that stuff, but she mostly 
concentrated on keeping the business floating the right way. Which is great. But they're nice and 
they're going to succeed very much. 
LO: And what do you about, you know, if s kind of a family business, which is kind of common 
on the waterfront, but I wonder if that changes the way the business is? You know maybe it’s 
more of a sense of family. 
JP: Oh absolutely. Thaf s what made this company, is being a family owned business. I mean you 
Interview with John Pelicas, February 10, 2017

call here and you get somebody here at the end of the phone. You don't get answering machine. 
And it doesn't matter what you're doing, if a customer walks in or somebody needs help, you stop 
and you help them and you deal with the rest of the stuff after. And that’s why, it’s like I said, it 
doesn't end at 4 o'clock. It goes on. If somebody's here that needs help, I stay or somebody calls, 
you help. Like if somebody's out on a boat and they call you, they call my boss, he doesn't have 
the answer, of course I'm going to help, you know. So thaf s how it goes [phone rings, IP 
whispers] That was the wife. 
LO: All right, well I think we can pretty much wrap up, are there, is there anything else that I 
didn't cover that you want to share or talk about. 
IP: No I just, you know the future for this we just need regulations down at the waterfront, so 
they can be better because if s not a mom and pop deal anymore. It's more companies that are 
run. It's easier for the government to regulate but if s making it harder for little companies like 
ourselves to keep going too because everybody's always looking for the great deal or you know, 
the great, you know... I don't know how to explain it. It's a little different you know, but it keeps 
them going. 
LO: Do you think the future looks bright or... 
IP: Oh I think so, I mean very bright. Were super busy and the people that are out there are very, 
they're business oriented so they're going to keep the fishing industry going and you know, if s 
good for all of us. It keeps all the mechanics and electricians and everybody else going 
LO: Do you feel like with the younger people that are coming into this company, there is a good 
workforce of people coming along? 
IP: Absolutely. We have a few bright guys, they're very smart, sharp. They're taking their jobs to 
heart too and that's what we want and we want them to feel that family-oriented thing because 
then the rest is smooth sailing. 
LO: Well thank you so much 
IP: No, thank you Laura. And nice talking to you and I hope this will be good for something 
LO: Oh absolutely. 
IP: Thanks, honey. 
LO: Okay.
