THE GRIP OF FRIENDSHIP'S HAND. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Written, composed, and sung by CHAS. H. 
D uscAN. 
Respectfully dedicated to JAMES DOUGLAS, Esq., Manager Heucles Opera 
House, Cincinnati. 
SOME people prize great riches, 
Others love a 
flattering tongue, 
But give to me the honest grip 
Of my dear fellow-man. 
'Tis something that is lasting, yes, 
And always will be grand; 
Then give to me that precious boon, 
A 
grip of friendship's hand. 
CHORUS. 
Here's a 
smile for those who love us 
All over this great land, 
But give to me that precious boon, 
A 
grip of friendship's hand. 
Friendship, ' tis said, is but a 
name 
All through this world of strife ; 
Men of you then will' make game 
In every walk of life. 
Keep up good pluck, some future time 
They yet will understand 
There's nothing half so pleasant as 
A 
grip of friendship's hand. 
Here's a 
smile, etc 
Live honest, upright, on the square, 
And at no distant day 
You'll learn that 'tis a 
policy 
That's always sure to pay. 
Be temperate in every act, 
United ever stand, 
And don't refuse your fellow-man 
A 
grip of friendship's hand. 
Here's a 
smile, etc. 
lvLL TELL MAMA. 
kn original song and chorus by CHAS. II . 
DUNCAN. 
I 
Toon my girl one evening out to ramble in the park, 
just for a 
little lark, I 
kissed her in the dark, 
She pretended not to like it then, and pouted up her lips, 
Then girdled and said, Oh, Charlie, aint this fun. 
She wore her hair in curls, like other charming girls, 
And tinilled me to my very finger tips; 
With her head upon my breast, 
Well, " you all know the 
rest." 
it ivas 1)leesant, for the little -game wa-s even.

Ions and be careful with a 
dainty little miss, 
Dona ask her for a 
kiss, but take it, she wont miss 
iron out her store of plenty, 
-Yet she loudly may scream this 
‘‘‘,C4o lway, you naughty man; I'll tell ma;_ma-111 tell

Should -you wish a

To coax the little maid; the •srmey little jade 
May be an 
for the moment, yet you'll win_ her in the

And laugh to think how easy it was done. 
Should she hang her head and pout 
Call you an ugly lout, don't falter, then, for forturme soon 
will send 
A 
bright, forgiving smile; if .you're patient just a 
while, 
Then you'll find the little game is won. 
But be cautious And be careful, .etc. 
I'LL GET RID OF MY MOTHER-IN-LAW, 
Original song and chorus by CHAS. II . 
DUNCAN. 
IF you please some time since I 
married 
A 
young and most beautiful girl, 
But now I 
do wish I 
had tarried, 
Foi my brain's in a 
terrible whirl; 
Her mother, alas, is my torment, 
She worries me out of my life, 
My feelings are all in a 
ferment, 
From the treuble I've had with my wife. 
SPOKEN—Yes, I've had more trouble with that wife a 
mine lately than one mortal can stand. 
Every time I 
wish anything done to suit me that old. woman always 
sticks in 14

CHORUS. 
But Fr/ stand inteference no more, 
To mo she's a 
terrible bore, 
So now, on my life 
boss my own wife 
And get rid of my mother-in-law. 
ne.'er shall forget our first baby, 
A 
bouncing blue-eyed little boy, 
The actions then of the old lady 
Drought me torment instead of great joy-; 
The neighbors all said he's a 
darling, 
The image of hispai, pa, pa. 
The old woman she. argued contrary, 
And swore he looked like his ma'ina. 
SeoKEN.—Yes, she said he looked like his meraa, and 
I'll be d—well, he didn't look like anything, like her or 
ttny of her family, but he was a 
perfect image of his dada. 
So I'll stand intefereace no. more,. etc. 
• 'TYIE CONEY ISLAND GIRL. 
An original Song and Chorus by CHAS. H. 
DuNc.&21. 
ONE Sunday morn I 
went 
On a 
trip to Coney Island. 
As through the bay we steamed away 
A 
charming girl I 
spied. 
A 
loving glance she sent, 
T 
he weary hours beguiling. 
She eat clam soup and caught the croup 
While floating with the tide. 
CHORUS. 
She sung so nice atud sweetly 
My brain was in a 
whirl; 
It broke my heart that day to part 
From my Coney Island girl. 
When we landed at the We 
She quickly took my arm; 
We 
chatted and talked as on we walked 
Toward the .crowded beach.. 
I 
asked her if she'd bathe. 
She smiled, and said, " of course." 
She looked so cute in a 
blue flannel suit 
I 
stuck to her like a 
leech. 
She vang so, etc. 
We battled with the stui, 
Then played with the water; 
She grabbed the rope anti tried to float, 
But got ducked for her pains. 
We dressed and dined at Cable's, 
When a 
tall man stood before us. 
Be called 1.10: Wife, spon my life, 
And spoiled our little game. 
SPOKEN.—Imagine my position—takiug a 
girl bathing, 
buying her pretzels, beer, and everything she wanted, and 
have a 
tall duffer step up and say, " Young fellow, do you 
/snow you're making yourself very fresh with ray wife ? " 
She sung so, etc.

THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGG. 
Written by BOBBY NEWCON3. Sung by CHAS. H. 
DUNCAN, 
W HEN I 
was of -age my father he left 
To me quite a 
snug little sum; 
He says—" Now, my boy, good sense please employ, 
And remember you've reached twenty-one." 
My friends when they heard of what had occurred, 
flow they hastened to borrow or beg ; 
For I 
flew a 
high kite-, and they said, when in sight— 
" 
He'S the goose with the golden egg." 
To my utmost surprise I 
attracted all eyes, 
And people inquired my name, 
Who a 
few months before, pronounced me a 
bore, 
And of my dress and my features made game. 
They'd laugh when I'd joke, with me dine, drink, or 
smoke, 
To my face they were dumb as a 
keg; 
But when I'd turn my back, how they'd laugh and they'd 
clack, 
At the goose with the golden egg. 
The girls all so fair, admired my hair, 
It was auburn—before it was red; 
They spoke of my style, drooped their eyes when I'd 
smile, 
And mammas marked me fit to be wed. 
Their daughters they sighed, and some their hair dyed, 
I 
was loved by Jane, Martha and Meg; 
My presents they took, and they all tried to hook— 
The poor goose with the golden egg. 
But a 
day came at last, I'd been living too fast, 
Run in debt and my money all flown; 
Where'er I 
would call, they'd let me wait in the hall, 
And the message I'd get—" Not at home." 
They'd giggle and jeer, where'er I 
appeared, 
Pass me by with a 
nod or a 
sneer; 
For the goose it was dead, and the egg turned to lead, 
I 
had bought my experience dear. 
Now my subject of rhyme may just be in time, 
For the world I 
don't care a 
peg ; 
But what I 
would say—I 
was once in my day, 
A 
poor goose with a 
golden egg. 
'CLOSE THE BLINDS GENTLY, DO, DEAR.. 
Original Song and ichorus, with Dialogue, by CHAS. H. 
DUNCAN, the Hit 
,of the Season, at Its,mlin's Colosseum Theatre, Chicago. 
LIST Thursday I 
met my Matilda 
Out walking to show her new clothes. 
She was dress'a in the height of the fashion, 
And wore in her hair a 
red rose. 
We walked and we talked for an hour -; 
How delightful the time passed away 
At last we arrived at her door, 
When she beg'd that I'd stop and take tea. 
CHORUS. 
Look out for the window, my darling; 
Some one is looking I 
fear. 
'The neighbors are all 'very prying, 
So close the blinds gently, do, dear. 
She wore her hair very peculiar, 
In a 
knot on the top of her head. 
She declared no man ever could fool her, 
And vowed that she never would wed,. 
She curled her lip up like a 
duchess 
When I 
asked her to give me a 
kiss, 
When I 
heg'd her to grant my request 
The answer she gave me was this: 
Look out for, etc. 
Should you meet her some evening out strolling 
And wish her acquaintance to make, 
Just give your high hat a 
slight flourish ; 
You'll find she the office will take. 
She's dashing and awfully clever, 
Full of life, and convivial too. 
Should she grant you permission to call 
You'll find she's a 
daisy, true blue. 
Look out for, etc.

POOR ORPHAN noya, 
As orienal Song and Chorus., 
by Cans. H. Duricem. 
As you walk through the street strange faces you meet 
On every hand passing along, 
Some laughing with glee, while others you see 
Look lost in the troublesome throng. 
The poor and distress'd—th e rich and well dress'd— 
Pass on in their sorrows and joys, 
Yet I 
beg you'll give heed to those whom in need 
You, find to be poor orphan boys, 
crionu&, 
Oh ! remember, my friends, as this life it soon ends, 
With all of its sorrows and joys, 
'Tis best you give heed to those whom in need 
You may find to be poor orphan boys. 
There is many a 
lad who has gone to the beci 
From neglect. and bad training alone— 
Been lost in the whirl of this great, wicked world, 
And forced among strangers to roam; 
Then, tempted to steal for the want of a 
meal, 
He is caught in the act, sent to fail, 
With not even a 
friend his excuse to defend 
Or take heed to his pitiful tale. 
Oh! remember, etc, 
Should you meet a 
boy whom vice would destroy 
Lift him up with a 
will if you can, 
You'll find in good time up the ladder he'll climb, 
And soon be a 
prosperous man; 
Then, some future day he will surely repay 
Your kindness to him when a 
lad, 
And you'll learn in the end that misfortune did send 
The best friend that you ever had. 
Oh ! remember, etc 
Sang with great success at the New Chicago Theatre, by CHARLES H. 
Dtrride.x. 
I'VE an object in view I 
would like to reveal, 
About a 
poor workingman tempted to steal, 
Whose children at home they were starving for food; 
The poor things were freezing; there was no coal nor 
wood. 
Alas I 
be it said sweet charity was dead; 
The friend of the poor to another world had sped. 
This poor workingman he had nothing in store, 
And a 
cry came from heaven, " Give aid to the poor!" 
Alexander T. Stewart, the great New York millionaire, 
Departed this life for another world's care. 
It would not have hurt him I'm certain and sure 
To have left a 
few thousands to help feed the poor. 
He invested, I'm told, in a 
great institute. 
In a 
matter of business " you bet" he was cute. 
He was not like Jim Fisk, nor will be many more, 
With his lightning express giving aid to the poor. 
My object, dear friends, is to ask you to share 
With the poor and the needy wherever you are. 
Remember that poverty is never a 
crime ; 
Good clothes often cover a 
heart filled with slime. 
Don't forget your dear mother wherever you roam, 
Nor the dear darling loved ones she tends well at home. 
Oh! don't let a 
hungry man go past your door, 
And God will reward giving aid to the poor. 
THE MAN FROM ST. 
LOUIS. 
An original song, by CHAS. II. 
DUNCAN. 
Sung to influence applause, at 
the New Chicago Theatre. 
I'LL sing to you of a 
strange old man, 
I 
met one stormy night; 
He was musing on his country's ills, 
And gave me an awful fright. 
He spoke to me of an iron bridge, 
That cross'd the Mississippi river; 
It was a 
horrible tale, indeed, 
And fairly froze my liver. 
He said Chicago had lost her grip, 
And soon would be bankrupt, 
Because her city officials were 
So awfully corrupt. 
He said there was coming a 
financial crash, 
That surely would pierce through us. 
Said I, for God's sake who are you ? 
Said he, I'm from St. Louis. 
He bragg'd to me of their commerce grand, 
And assured me on his word, 
The Mississippi jetties would soon be fixed, 
Then Chicago would be floor'd. 
He made remarks on our filthy streets, 
- But spoke not of his own, 
Nor of their women's terrible feet, 
Nor where they had been grown. 
(1) 
He spoke to me of their tunnel grand, 
That wound round under the streets 
But spoke not of the awful deaths 
There many a 
creature meets. 
I 
look'd into his pitiless face, 
And thought what ill-wind blew us, 
This man possess'd of a 
terrible gall, 
Who said he came from St. Louis. 
Now should you meet him on his rounds, 
You'll know his ugly mug, 
And that terrible big proboscis, 
That borders on a 
pug. 
His feet are long and slim, 
With bunions on the sides, 
He shuffles along as though half dead, 
When he should make big strides. 
He's knock-knee'd and bow-legged too, 
Yet thinks himself quite pretty ; 
He says he is the ladies' pet 
When in his native city. 
While walking with my steady girl, 
He step'd up and swore he knew us; 
Alas, that I 
should ever have met 
This terrible man from St. Louis.

Some think I'm in the wine trade, 
Oc a 
lawyer, ' .7„,:•ore's the pity," 
At any rate they'ro all agreed 
I'm aornething in the city. 
Cho.—Something in the city, dm. 
8. Perhaps I 
meet with Smith, we have a 
glass, 
And talk about the weather, 
When in conies Brown—(you all know Brown)--
We " hob and nob" together; 
When I'm gone, Brown says, " Who ia that chap I" 
" 
That's Johnson, rather witty; 
What is he I 
blest if I 
can tell, 
He's a—a 
something in the city." 
11P,',KEN.—Of course, a 
fella couldn't walk up to another fella, 
and ask the fella how he got his living, could he ?—it would puzzle 
some fellows to tell, wouldn't it ?—so I 
find it considered highly 
respectable to be— 
Cho.—Sometbing in the city, itc. 
4. On peoples' curiosity 
I'd never put a 
stopper, 
So let them think me what they choose, 
As long as its something " proper ;" 
But if I 
tell you—you'll keep it dark, 
Or else %would be a 
pity— 
Well, now, when I'm in the city, I 
am 
Something in the city. 
Cho.—I'm something in the city, 
Yaas, something in the city, 
You'll find it highly proper, to be 
Something in the city. 
MEMOIRS OF THE STAGE. 
Written by Wm. R. W ATTS. 
Sung with immense success all over 
America, by CHAS. 11. D UNCAN. 
IN 
the bright annals of the stage, 
Sonic great men we have lost, 
Who now have left the footlights' glare, 
To another land have crossed. 
Edwin Adams we shall see no more, 
From us he's passed away., 
Nor Burton, with his merry laugh, 
The drunken Toodles play. 
We'll smile no more at G. L. Fox, 
And gone from us afar, 
Is the one we loved above them all, 
Old Uncle Ben DeBar. 
E. L. Davenport has passed away, 
Yet his fame I 
will recall; 
Such men will never be forgot, 
And I 
wish good luck to all. 
Where are the merry minstrels gone, 
Who in the days past by, 
Did make you laugh throughout the night, 
When filled with milth and joy ? 
Where's Budworth with his banjo string, 
And Unsworth in his speech, 
George Christy who when at the end, 
None could in fun outreach.

MEMOIRS OF THE STAGE.—Concluded 
Where is the man so great f
,n(1. 
To every one a 
friend, Billy Manning ? 
Greatest of them all, 
Alas, he met his end. 
Where is Dan Bayant, whom you loved ? 
On him no more you'll call. 
Such men will never be forgot, 
And I 
wish good luck to all. 
Matilda Heron, bright Camille, 
Has crossed the unknown shore, 
And Lucille Western, once our pride, 
Has gone forever more. 
Great Charlotte Cushman disappeared, 
And we can mourn our loss. 
Sweet Laura Keene has pass'd away, 
The dark dread gulf has cross'd. 
Such women in my early days, 
I 
loved to see them play, 
And watched them tread the mimic stage, 
In hours now passed away. 
I 
thought the angels were so bright, 
Till they from life did fall ; 
They yet in memory hold a 
place, 
And I 
wish good luck to all.

Written by W. R. 
W ATTS, and eung all over America, by CHAS. H. 
DUNCAN, 
I'm going to start a 
show, and around this country go, 
With some figures I 
shall have made. up in wax, 
Of men who've made a 
name, and won a 
mighty fame, 
So listen while your memory I 
tax. 
A 
small sum you must pay, for any trouble by the way, 
And then a 
list of all I'll give to you, 
And I'll have them all to stand, in my little joval band 
Of figures that make up this little show. 
In this theatre each night, where I'll show to you each 
sight, 
Where jollity in power rule supreme : 
Every figure you shall see, as exhibited by me, 
Which in my circus tent may soon be seen. 
I'll have Butler peeping sly, as to steal some spoons he'll 
try, 
The Congressmen all taking their back pay ; 
I'll have Grant in Europe stay, eating free lunch every 
day, 
And cheating " John Bull" as he goes his way ;

THE CIRCUS TENT.—Concluded. 
I'11 have Moody trying to weep, beAmase Sankey lost his 
sheep; 
The Mormon chiefs all kissing their last bride. 
I'll have Beecher trying to show, how far a 
workingman 
can go, 
With naught but bread and water at his side. 
I'll have those frauds, the Indian tribes, 
Whom Gen. Howard derides, for they fool him to their 
heart's most great content. 
I'll have England's rifle corps, stopping home on John 
Bull's shore 
A 
losing team beneath this circus tent. 
I'll have the Count Johannes stand, the crushed trage-
dian of this land, 
Our President, who cold water does take, 
Going up in a 
balloon, with Dr. Mary Walker's panta-
loons, 
While he tips Susan Anthony the wink. 
I'll have James Gordon Bennett drawn, fighting duels in 
a 
horn, 
As he stood in Delaware and shot the bull. 
I'll have the great George Francis Train playing poker 
with Jim Blaine, 
And Babcock drinking whiskey till he's full. 
I'll have Christianity at work, killing off that nasty Turk, 
And all you people smiling with content, 
If you'll stand up in a 
row, as I 
give my little show, 
Beneath the canvas of ray circus tent.

SOMETHING I CAN'T UNDERSTAND. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Original MItsic, 
Sung by CHARLES11. D 
ILNUAN. 
M ANY things come to pass that I 
can't understand, 
And puzzle my mind every day. 
My feelings oft'tinies I 
cannot command, 
Try ever so hard as I 
may, 
When a 
beggar I 
meet who asks something to eat, 
With features all sunburned and tanned, 
Then riches for one, while others have none, 
Is something I 
can't understanl 
While the laborer toils in the hot, broiling sun, 
And his children are starving at home, 
The man we elect steals a 
fabulous sum, 
And for pleasure in Europe does roam. , 
He cuts quite a 
dash on the workingman's cash, 
Rides out in a 
style that is grand. 0 
Why thus it should be is a 
mystery to me 
And something I 
can't understand. 
It is high time indeed that we had a 
change, 
And rogues to justice were brought; 
Acquittals occur that seem very strange, 
Then. ' tis rumored the jury was bought. 
A 
judge we elect our peace to protect, 
When a 
bribe is put into his hand, 
Accepts with a 
will, his pockets does fill, 
Yet ' tis something I 
can't understand. 
I 
hope that this motto a 
lesson will teach 
To men who are tempted to steal; 
Bring good resolution to those it may reach, 
And honesty's purpose reveal. 
Just keep up good pluck; don't bow to bad luck; 
In friendship unitedly stand, 
Then some future day you will be proud to say, 
" 
I 
am glad I 
at last understand."

THE NATIONAL GUARD. 
Sung with great success by CONROY and HUNTER. 
On, bright and gay is the National Guard! with colors 
flying free, 
We dash along and grandly parade; here's none so 
proud as we. 
Our guns we hold in the prettiest line, to catch the peo-
ple's eye, 
With our heads upright and eyes so bright when we go 
marching by. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp! right about we go! 
The stars and stripes above, so gallantly they flow. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, down Broadway. 
The ladies wave their little hands to see our grand array. 
CHORUS. 
Mark time! march, in our uniform so bright. 
The drums and trumpets play, and fill us with delight 
When we meet to march or fight. 
We take the lead—we do, indeed—the American National 
Guard. 
Oh, still on hand is the National Guard to meet the nation's 
foe, 
And bright and clear their record so fair, which all the 
people know. 
We heed the call of the national voice, and ready lads 
we are. 
At the word of command, with heart and hand, we rally 
near and far. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp! gleams our banner high; 
Your heart will beat With pride to see us passing by. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, gay lads we, 
To right about and in and out, parading bold and free. 
Mark time, etc. 
Then here's success to the National Guard, and may it 
lead the van, 
And always heed the national call—be ready every man. 
Oh, may it ever its powder keep dry to strike a 
gallant blow, 
While the people love those stars above bright waving to 
and fro. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, - tramp! in the van we lead, 
The people come from far to see each man and steed. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, light and gay. 
We're always ready, rank and file, to meet and march 
away. 
Mark time, etc.

THE BABY SHOW. 
Written and sung by CHAS. II. 
DUNCAN', the Hit of the Season, at Iiirrom 
ELL'S Theatre Comique, St. Louis. 
SOME time ago they gave a 
show, 
That caused sensation great— 
In Gotham's Grand Fifth Avenue, 
It's sights I 
will relate. 
There mothers sighed, while babies cried, 
Yet not a 
tear did flow; 
The kids would whine most all the time, 
Up at the Baby Show. 
CHORES. 
Such a 
squalling, such a 
bawling, 
They set up around that floor, 
Pa, pa, pa! ma, ma, ma! 
They continually did roar. 
Some had two, some had three, 
How they do it I 
don't know; 
It was a 
curious sight indeed, 
The New York Baby Show. 
As you walked along with the buzzing throng, 
Quite frequent you would hear, 
" 
You little darling," " tootsy wootsy," 
" 
Please let me hold the dear." 
" 
Aint she nice," " you pearl of price," 
All sitting in a 
row ; 
They'd rub the thumb against the gum, 
Up at the Baby Show. 
Such a 
squalling, etc. 
Another day I 
chanced that way, 
Inspected the cherubs well; 
One took my eye as passing by, 
Oh couldn't she pout and yell, 
Up in my arms, admired its charms, 
You've all been there I 
know, 
Upon my vest—you know the rest, 
Up at the Baby Show. 
Such a 
squalling, etc. )

THE TALK OF THE TOWN. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. Ilennuco, 229 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I WANDER thro' life like a 
gentleman's son, 
For fortune has favored me well, 
I'm blest with good temper and love to make fun, 
No matter with whom I 
may dwell; 
I've made many friends in my rambles about, 
And gained a 
good share of renown, 
'Till now I'm so famous within and without, 
It seems I'm the talk of the town. 
CHORUS . 
I 
am the talk of the town, they say, 
Friends grow around me from day to day, 
Because I 
possess such a 
charming way, 
I'm really the talk of the town. 
Wherever I 
go it is always the same, 
I'm known just as soon as I'm seen, 
They point with their fingers and mention my name, 
While taking survey of my mien; 
I 
smile recognition, and say nothing more, 
Tho' sometimes they force me to frown, 
But I 
find it's no use to give praise or abuse, 
When I 
am the talk of the town. 
I 
am the talk, etc. 
I'm known to the girls and I'm known to the boys, 
And legions of all human kind 
O'er- shadow my footsteps in sorrows Or joys, 
And give me a 
piece of their mind; 
Some love me, some hate me„ some say I'm a 
fraud, 
And many would fain crush me down. 
But such is the fate of the good and the great, 
It's because I'm the talk of the town. 
I 
am the talk, etc. 
22? 
NOT THAT I WISH TO SAY ANYTHING 
WRONG. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Now it's not that I 
wish to say anything wrong, 
Not for the world, not I ; 
But you can't help noticing some little things 
That daily occur on the sly ; 
While walking along down the street here to-night 
A 
neighbor of mine passed me by; 
Well—it was not his wife he had on his arm— 
But I 
shall say nothing, not I. 
CHORUS. 
For it's not that I 
wish to say anything wrong, 
Not for the world, not I; 
But you can't help noticing some little things 
Just as you're passing by. 
There's Jenkins, the bobby, he lives next door to me, 
But his house is much finer than mine ; 
And it's strange how he does it on ten dollars a 
week, 
While my wages exceed twenty-nine; 
He's got a 
gold watch and a 
beautiful guard, 
And some rings that would dazzle your eye, 
But how he came into possession of these, 
Why, I 
shall say nothing—not I. 
For it's not, etc. 
Besides, there's Miss Brown, now she lives in our street, 
But she dresses remarkably gay, 
And however she can do it on nine shillings a 
week 
Would puzzle a 
lawyer to say; 
At night she is seen with so many young men 
That to find out why I 
mean to try, 
Atli mind if I 
find she does anything wrong, 
why, I 
shall say nothing—not I. 
For it's not, etc. 
Well, again, there's Miss Green, who has led a 
fast life, 
To a 
banker was going to be wed; 
But somehow the marriage has been broken off, 
Through flirting too much, it is said ; 
But while passing her house one evening this week 
A 
baby was heard for to cry ; 
Well, they say it is one she has taken to nurse, 
But I 
shall say nothing—not I. 
For it's not, etc.

I WANDER)) to-day on the sea shore, 
The winds and the waves were low, 
And I 
thought of the days that are gone, Maud, 
Many long years ago; 
! 
those were the happiest days of all, Maud, 
Not a 
care nor a 
sorrow did we know, 
As we played on the white pebbled sand, Maud, 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
CHORE'S. 
(lathering,- up the shells from the sea shore 
Gatherin 
up the shells from the shore ; 
Alt I 
those were the happies6 days of at, Maud, 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
Oh, don't you remember the day, Maud, 
The last time we wander'd on the shore, 
Our hearts were so joyous and gay, Maud, 
For you promised to be mine evermore; 
Then the shells they were whiter than ever, 
And the bright waves were lovelier than before, 
The hours were but moments to us, Maud. 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
Gathering up the shells, etc. 
But now we are growing up in years, Maud, 
Our locks are all silver'd and gt ay, 
Yet the vows that we made on the shore, Maud, 
Are fresh in our mem'ries to- day ; 
There still is a 
charm in those bright shells 
And the Sound of the deep ocean's roar, 
For they call back the days that we spent, Maud. 
Gathering up the shells from the shore. 
Gathering up the shells, etc. 
WHAT WOULD MAMMA SAY ? 
OR, GET ALONG, JOSEPH. 
The Music of this song is published by W HITE & GOULLAUD, 86 Tremor 
st., Boston. 
Price 35 cents. 
Now some girls are bashful, 
And others are bold; 
Now I 
knew a 
charmer 
Of nineteen years old ; 
About her, like some others, 
There was much pretence, 
For, at the least thing, 
she'd be sure to commence (with her) 
CHORITS. 
Oh, my, fie, for shame, 
What would mamma say ? 
What would papa say 
Oh, my, fie, for shame, 
Get along, Joseph, do. 
I'd take her about 
To wherever she'd please; 
When we were alone 
She'd appear ill at ease; 
Now a 
kiss once a 
week 
Every fellow'd expect, 
But when I 
tried for one, 
She'd be sure to object, ( with her) 
Oh, my, etc. 
Her pa and her ma 
Out of town chanced to be, 
So I 
called on my charmer, 
And with her took tea; 
The time like a 
slow 
Quaker's meeting did pass, 
Till she somehow by accident 
Turned out the gas. 
SPOKEN.—There we were all in the dark. 
I 
was afraid to 
move for fear of breaking something, and she couldn't or 
said— 
wouldn't find th e mat
ches. When she found I 
didn't 
move, she 
said— 
Oh, 
etc. 
She seemed oh, so awfully 
Coy and demure, 
That I 
thought her complaint 
Only marriage would cure; 
WHAT WOULD MAMMA SAY ?—Continued. 
So I 
asked " If she'd wed ?" 
Did she think she would die ? 
She pretended to faint, 
But her only reply was— 
Oh, my, etc. 
Now I 
found out this bashful 
And timid young lamb 
Was simply a 
con-
Glom-er-a-tion of sham; 
To two other parties • 
Her kisses were free; 
Perhaps she had one of them, 
But she didn't, "have me," ( with her) 
Oh, my etc. 
I'LL BE A RAMBLER NO MORE.

Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SHELLY. 
Lorto, long ago, when wild and gay, 
I 
rambled from friends and home, 
Strayed from the scenes of boyhood's play, 
'Mid strangers to live and roam; 
Only in dreams and fancies bright 
Can I 
see my loved ones of yore; 
But now I'll go back to my old delight, 
And I'll be a 
rambler no more, 
No more, no more, no more— 
I'll be a 
rambler no more. 
Years I 
have lived in distant lands, 
And thought of the gladsome past; 
Oft I 
have sighed to press the hand 
That lingered in mine the last; 
Sad I 
have been at night and day, 
Far away from those I 
adore; 
But homeward again I 
will go, so gay, 
And I'll be a 
rambler uo more, 
No more, no more, no more— 
I'll be a 
rambler no more.

Six girls and one big boy, 
With the neighbors they are friendly, 
They are their mother's joy; 
It's every summer evening, 
When the heat would make you droop; 
Friends there meet from every street 
To gossip on our front stoop. 
There's dainty Misses Grogan, 
Alexander McAfee, 
The undertaker Hogan, 
The pride of Calvary. 
Such splendid vocalization, 
'Twould burst an opera troupe; 
The Sweet By and By would make a 
man die, 
As sung on our front stoop. 
They talk about the INIurphys, 
And say they put on style, 
And how their daughter Mary 
Went down to Coney Isle 
With a 
German music teacher, 
Who filled her with clam soup, 
Then they say 
don't give it away, 
What you hear on our front stoop.

WHAT RIGHT HAS A MAN TO BE POOR. 
Written by J. F. PooLE. 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
Pm going to sing a new ditty: 
You will say there is truth in my rhyme. 
Where ever you go through the city— 
That poverty's counted a 
crime. 
A man may be worthy and honest, 
Yet his conduct we cannot endure 
For while Riches alone People worship, 
What right has a man to be poor. 
One day as I 
went out a- walking, 
Stop thief I" I 
heard somebody cry— 
Amongst the crowd that began to assemble 
Was a 
ton with a, 
glass to his eye. 
At a 
poor workingman there he pointed, 
Saying that ruflim you'd better secure, 
That he is the thief I 
assure you 
He must be because he's so poor. 
Tother day on a 
steamboat excursion, 
A young lady fell ovet-board 
A poor man jumped utter to save her, 
While her parents in agony roared. 
When safe in his arms he brought her, 
Say's her father, I 
thank you, I'm sure ; 
But you'll please to leave go of my daughter, 
To embrace her, young man, you're to poor. 
When war cast a 
cloud o'er our nation 
And liberty's call did resound ; 
How many kid gloved wearing gentry 
In the ranks of our soldiers were found. 
The first 
to march off was the toiler, 
Our Union and rights to secure; 
When our Banner was saved from the spoiler 
The fighting men came from the poor.

HE 
takes me gently round the waist, 
He holds his arm just so, 
I 
place my willing hand in his, 
And gayly off we go; 
He's never weary of the dance, 
And I'm about the same, 
And when the music sounds no more, 
I 
cry, Oh, what a 
shame ! 
SPOKEN.—Yes, indeed, Fin quite sorry when the dance is 
over; it seems like waking from a 
sweet little sleep. 
Of course 
my Charlie is the whole cause of it—everybody is aware of 
that— because you know— 
CHORUS. 
He's such a 
lovely waltzer, 
So graceful he can go, 
Oh, he's such a 
lovely waltzer, 
My darling, dancing beau! 
Around the floor with many more, 
We go in wild delight; 
We think of nothing but the dance. 
While in the mazy flight ; 
We seem to float upon the air, 
Like angels from above, 
And everywhere we take our share 
Of music, dance, and love. 
SPONEN.—Under some circumstances it might not seem so 
delightful, but with him it's—well, you can guess now nice it is 
when i 
say— 
HE'S SUCH A LOVELY WALTZER.—Continued. 
I 
can't endure those old quadrilles, 
And reels—oh, gracious, don't, 
Don't speak of them ; if you insist, 
I 
plainly say I 
won't; 
I'm far above those worn out things, 
They're much too full of halts ; 
No dance to me can ever bring 
Such pleasure as the waltz. 
SPOKEN.—And he's such a 
glorious fellow! 
Sometimes when 
the dance is over he says," Come, love, and have some soda water. 
You like soda water, I 
suppose ?" I 
tell him I 
do like it very 
well. 
Then he says. "Soda I 
1" 
And if there happens to be a 
bright moon looking down from the sky, lie often tells me that 
he wonders which looks the most glorious, the moon or my 
eyes. 
I 
say, " Hush ! don't talk nonsense." 
But then I 
don't 
care what he says—my admiration is all based upon the fact 
that— 
He's such, etc. 
With mellow strains from jolly Strauss, 
And gleaming lights around, 
Our forms entwined, our joy combined, 
We hear the gladsome sound; 
We think no more of worldly woe, 
While quickly flies the time; 
The music comes so soft and low, 
I 
think it quite sublime. 
SPOKEL—Sublime, did I 
say 1 Yes, that's just the word. 
I 
may seem a 
little enthusiastic, but I 
can't help it I It's all ba-
cause— 
He's such, etc,

I TOOK my girl one clay, 
A 
sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name. 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did stare; 
And one and all around her did exclaim: 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
Emma, you put me in quite a 
dilemma, 
Oh! Emma, whoa ! Emma, 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go 
I 
ask'd them what they meant ? 
When some one at me sent 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye. 
Emma began to scream ! 
" 
Oh, Fred, what does this mean ?" 
I 
ask'd again, imd this was their reply— 
Oh! Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police !" 
And when he came he look'd at me so sly. 
The crowd then at me laugh'd, 
And said I 
must be " daft ;" 
And once again they all commene'd to cry— 
Oh! Emma, etc. 
An old man said to me, 
" 
Why, young man, can't you see 
The joke ?" and I 
look'd at him with surprise! 
He said, " don't be put out, 
It's a 
saying's got about ;" 
And then their voices seem'd to rend the skies, 
Oh! Emma, etc.

I 
am a

I 
work along the shore, 
To keep the hungry wolves away 
From the poor ' longshoreman's door; 
I 
toil all day in the broiling sun 
On the ships that come from sea ; 
From broad daylight till late at night, 
For a 
poor man's family. 
CHORUS. 
Give us fair pay for every day 
Is what we ask of ye ; 
Our cause is right, 
We are out on a 
strike 
For a 
poor man's family. 
Oh! the rich one's gilded carriages 
And horses swift and strong, 
Whin a 
poor man asks for a 
bite to eat 
They tell him he Is wrong ; 
Go take your shovel in your hand, 
Go out and work for me; 
Die or live they have nothing to give 
To a 
poor man's family. 
Give us, etc. 
They bring over their Italians 
And Chinamen from the South ; 
Thinking they can do our work, 
Take the bread from out our mouths. 
The white man's children they must starve; 
Shure we will not agree 
To be put down like a 
worm in the ground, 
And starve our family. 
Give us, ete.

THE robin was singing a 
song in the tree, 
The blue birds were twittering near, 
The linnet re-echoed a 
beautiful glee, 
In notes that were mellow and clear; 
The dew-laden daisies just over the lea 
Had a 
kiss from the radiant sun, 
When Jamie, my lover, came over to ma 
And brightened the heart he had won, 
My Jamie was telling a 
tale of the sea, 
His voyage to glittering lands, 
The changes in life since my sailor and me 
First grasp'd one another's brown hands; 
He told of the fields and the hills far away, 
The skies he had seen in the West, 
When closer I 
drew to his sailer array 
And rested my bead on his breast, 
The ocean may rumble and roar on its way, 
The beacon its flittering make, 
The vessels may dance in the foam and the spray, 
And billows may thunder and break ; 
Tho' others may sigh for a 
life on the sea, 
A 
home on the raging abyss, 
My Jamie will never more wander from me, 
My heart is now wedded to his.

MANY CAN HELP ONE. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SOME very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you ; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't ; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
A 
man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door; 
Such men as these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place; 
A 
man may be poor, but still honest be. 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace ; 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
No knowing when the tide it may turn ; 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he's sure to return. 
--Then give what you can, etc.

flitHE WAS JUST ABOUT THE AGB.--(CmicLonsp) 
She lived a 
little way from town, ;t 
wasn't very far, 
And with her dwelt a 
cross old man although be was her pa; 
One day when her papa was out I 
went to her's to dine, 
And in my pocket for a 
treat, I 
took a 
quart of wine. 
For she liked wine, she would you know, she would you know, shr 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she was just about the e-ge-
We sat and talked a 
little while, and after we had dined, 
I 
for a 
little drop of wine felt mightily inclined, 
When a 
rat- tat we heard at the door, and she to me did rush, 
And pushed me in the cupboard, and 'twas then I 
saw her blush: 
But then, of course, she would you know, she would you know, she 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she- was just about the age. 
Her father then came in, and talked for half an hour or more, 
And she sat leaning alt the while against the cupboard door, 
When the wine-flask in my pocket broke and made a 
precious mess, 
Ran underneath the cupboard door, all round her new silk dress. 
For she wore silk, she would you know, she would you know. she 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she was just about the age. 
Her father saw the flowing wine, and said 
Sarah, what is that 
She said. " Some jam and pickle jars are broken by the cat ," 
He opened then the cupboard door, exclaiming, " Who are you?' 
And I 
was in a 
pickle, in a 
jam, and in a 
stew. 
The old man swore he would you know, he would you know, he 
would, 
But then, of course, ho would you know, he was just about the age. 
He pulled me out and punched my head, then with good humor he, 
On hearing I 
was not bad off, invited me to tea; 
since then I've married Sarah Green, and pleased I 
am to see, 
That she and all our little ones quite happy seem to be. 
DIAt then, of course, she would you know, she would you know, she 
would, 
But thez., of oourse, she would you know, she was just about the age.

DON'T YOU DARE TO DO IT, GEORGE. 
I 
COURTED once a 
lovely girl, 
A 
beauty young and fair, 
She'd cherry- red lips, and teeth like pearl, 
And golden was her hair; 
Her eyes were like the evening stars, 
That shine in heaven above, 
And with this lovely beauty 
I 
was overhead in love. 
SPOKEN.—I 
shall never forget the first time I 
met that girl— 
never—no never, and when the time came to bid her good-bye 
you know that time always comes, although it comes rather late 
with some, and rather early with others. 
We were early birds 
that time—early in the morning, you know. 
So, I'd gone 
through all the preliminary ceremonies, such as good-bye, 
darling, and pleasant dreams, and l'd just slided my arm around 
her waist and was going to give her one good kiss right square 
on the mouth, when she boxed my ears and said: 
CHORUS. 
" 
Don't you dare to do it, George, 
Don't you dare to do it, George; 
If ' twas found out, what would my mother say 1 
Don't you dare to do it, George, 
Don't you dare to do it, George; 
Ain't you a 
very, very, naughty man ? " 
I 
took her for a 
walk one night, 
'Twas in a 
flowery dell, 
And while there, to my fair one, 
I 
tales of love did tell; 
She sat down in a 
shaded spot, 
I 
sat down by her side, 
And with my arm around her waist 
I 
said, " darling, be my bride." 
SPOKEN.—" Yes," I 
says to her, says I—" Susan," says I—says 
I—" Susan," says I—. 
Darned if I 
know what I 
did say now; 
(1) 
but I 
know I 
said it, yes, I 
did, and when I 
showed her the ring, 
and asked her for her answer, she said : " Get away, George, 
you're always saying something," that means yes, yes it does, 
so I 
says to her, says I, " I'll go and have our names put in the 
morning papers, and then I'll go to the minister and have our 
names called in church next Sunday, George so-and-so, and 
Miss Susan so-and-so, to be joined together in holy wedlock, 
any one having any objections will please state them or forever 
after hold their peace, and my Susan actually swooned over in 
my arms; yes, she did; and when she came to herself the very 
first words she uttered were: 
Don't you dare to do it, etc. 
Well I 
need not tell you more about 
Those happy nights we met, 
For soon we put off courting, boys, 
And married we did get; 
And now I 
feel so happy, 
Oh my heart is filled with joy ; 
For yesterday my Susan dear 
Brought forth a 
little boy. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, it's the prettiest little baby you ever saw. Oh, 
girls, do come and see it! all the girls in the neighborhood have 
been to see it, and they say it's the handsomest child they ever 
saw— the very picture of its father. 
I'm its father ; yes, I 
am. 
By the by, boys, before I 
go I'll let you into a 
little secret, on 
the quiet, you know. 
When you take your sweetheart out for 
an evening's promenade and you want to kiss her good bye at 
the door, and she says, " don't you dare to do it," that's the 
time you must. They only pretend to be a 
little shy. 
Why, bless 
your soul, after they're married their shyness and bashfulness all 
vanish just as quickly as a glass of lager in the hands of a 
thirsty Dutchman. 
Why, since 
I've been 
maried, I don't 
remember, not even once, my Susan ever saying: 
Don't you dare to do it, etc.

BIDDY THE BALLET GIRL. 
Written by J. 
BRADLEY, and sung with great success by JACK Co
-ROY, 
every evening, at GILL'S, 15 West Houston street. 
I AM a 
gay laboring man, 
And I 
have a 
beautiful daughter, 
Who never did care much for work, 
It's her mother's own wish that she aughter; 
It seems that she fancied the stage, 
So I 
granted her final request, 
And now she's a 
beautiful dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarty; 
She lifings home at night, and at matinees, 
Large baskets of flowers, and also bouquets. 
Oh, she is my only daughter, 
And I 
am the man that taught her 
To wear spangled clothes, and go round on her toes, 
And there is no such a 
girl as Biddy. 
When salary day does arrive, 
All trouble and toil it does smother, 
For, just the day before that there was a 
kick, 
The girl had been scolded by her mother ; 
She's courting a 
clerk in the bank, 
Who sees her safe home at the door, 
And pays a 
big gang in the gallery, 
To applaud in a 
perfect uproar. 
On the stage, etc. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid ; 
I 
thought I 
would go to the theatre, 
And take the old woman along; 
In the parquette in front I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance, 
My son Danny was up in the tier ; 
He cried, " Go in, sister Biddy," 
When they bounced him right out on his ear. 
On the stage, etc. 
Written and Composed by A RTIFIUR LLOYD, 
I'm a 
jolly old nt Iler, Bob B . 11 is my name, 
And in my own village I'm well known to fame, 
I've a 
wife aud a 
daughter, a 
dear little lass. 
I'm fond ot them both, and I'm fond of a 
glass. 
Sonic say, I'm too fowl, well, perhaps that may be, 
I 
try to be steady, and am, as you see, 
But if I 
attempt to refuse think a-day, 
I 
fancy the wheel of the mill seems to say— 
cnouss. 
Take it Bob, take it Bob. take it Bob, take it Bob, 
That's what I 
fancy the mill says to me; 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, it's better than tea. 
I've tried very oft a 
tee totler to be, 
But my mill is quite right, brandy's better than tea, 
And altbo' what I 
say, you may all think absurd, 
I 
believe what the mill says is right, 'pen my word. 
I 
called on old Jones ' bout some business, you know, 
And he said, Bob, a 
pipe and a 
glass, ' fore ye go, 
Now I 
didn't require it, believe what I 
say, 
hut altho' a 
mile off, I 
could hear the mill say— 
Tate it Bob, &a. 
Now I 
dreamt Vother night that Bolt Bell was no more, 
That he'd died at the age of p'rhaps forty or more, 
And 1 
heard people round me say, drink's done its worst, 
But altho' I 
was dead, I 
was dying with thirst. 
A bottle of brandy close by I 
could see, 
It was meant for the mourners, it vvaau't for me, 
But as on my bed, still and silent I 
lay, 
In the distanoe distinctly I 
beard the mill say— 
Take it Bob, &es 
I'm only up here for a 
bit of a 
spree, 
My wife thinks it's busin•ss between yon and me, 
And you know the old saying, that never deceives, 
What the heart doesn't see why the eye doesn't grieve, 
I 
must toddle at once, so good bye to ye all, 
Next season I 
hope I 
shall give ye a 
call, 
Don't ask me to drink when I'm going away, 
Or I'm ,certain to fancy I 
hear hear the mill say 
Take it !Sob. &e.

Though the mills have closed to-day. 
Hush, my little darling, hush thee, 
Check your hunger for awhile, 
Try to bear the burden lightly— 
Substitute for tears a 
smile; 
Do not let your courage falter, 
For I've heard your papa say, 
That his darling should not suffer, 
Though the mills have closed to-day. 
Hush, my little darling, etc. 
Hush, my little darling, hush thee, 
Try and do the best you can, 
And your father will sustain you 
Like an honest workingman; 
Though he cannot get the money 
That is due him, let us pray 
For relief from other sources 
Than the mills that closed to-day. 
Hush, my little darling, etc.

H ER mother was his early love, 
Her sire his boyhood's friend, 
And when they pass'd away, their child, 
The old man vow'd to tend. 
She was the sunshine of his home, 
A 
rose so bright and fair, 
With all her mother's loving ways, 
Her eyes and golden hair, 
Her eyes and golden hair. 
What wonder to his lonely heart 
Crept back the love of old, 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold ; 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold. 
One day there came a 
seemly knight 
To woo her from his side, 
The old man smiled upon him, 
For her sake, his joy and pride, 
His joy and pride. 
But fickle was the knight- and false 
(A story threadbare old), 
He woo'd her for a 
little while, 
Then wed for lands and gold. 
A. blighted flower can bloom no more, 
The old man weptone day, 
As murmuring the name she lov'd, 
His darling pass'd away, 
As murmuring the name she lov'd, 
His darling, his darling, his darling, pass kl away. 
OYSTERS AND WINE AT 2 A. M. 
I'm a 
maiden who never refuses, 
The pleasures that come in my way, 
For now is the time to be merry, 
To be bashful is but to delay; 
When the stars far above us are shining, 
With a 
party of friends, but a 
few, 
Quick the night pass-s 
by and we finish, 
With oysters and wine at 2. 
CHORUS. 
Oysters and wine at 2 
A. hi., 2 
A. ht., 2 
A. M., 
Oysters and wine at 2 
A. M., oysters and wine a4 2. 
Now a 
journey to Long Branch is pleasant, 
Oh ! yes, ' tis delightful to me, 
We stroll on the beach in the moonlight, 
When the wild waves are roaring with glee; 
Oh! but give me a 
partner for dancing, 
And sweet music to ' liven us too, 
While we whisper " good- night," and then finish 
With oysters and wine at 2. 
Oysters and wine, etc. 
Thro' this wide world where we now are roaming, 
Life calls for excitement and fun, 
So why should we sigh, or feel gloomy, 
For too soon will life's pleasures be done ; 
So then let us be merry while living, 
For it never will do to look blue, 
But still cling to the pleasures delightful, 
And oysters and wine at 2. 
Oysters and wine, etc. 
Now my wanderings are over 
I 
hope I 
am greeted by all, 
Then try and assist a 
poor brother, 
Let his offerings be ever so small ; 
Though some people and fortune may sever, 
And have not a 
dollar for toys, 
But then if I 
do live forever, 
I'll never go back on the boys. 
So here's we may never know sorrow, 
Together we'll share all our joys, 
I'll meet you again on the morrow, 
And I'll never go back on the boys. 
Whe2, a 
man has acquired wealth plenty 
To buy all this world in its joys, 
You'll find nineteen out of twenty 
Will turn their back on the boys ; 
They for:let that they once was lonely, 
And think of their troubles no more, 
They're down on a 
friend because only— 
This friend he chances to be poor. 
So here's we may never know sorrow, etc. 
I've travelled this wide world over, 
The South, the East, and the West, 
And at the end I 
discovered 
That here in the North was the best ; 
The people up here can live quietly, 
And have all the world in its joys, 
That is if they only act rightly, 
And never go back on the boys. 
So here's we may never know sorrow, etc. 
THEY SAID I COULDN'T DO IT. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
'TN many years since I 
was born 
Into this world of sin, 
The event I 
cannot recollect, 
But it matters not a 
pin ; 
My nurses—clever folks were they— 
Said I'd be a 
sickly kid, 
That I'd never come to man's estate, 
As I 
hadn't long to live. 
SPOKEN. — Clever people 
They said this the day that 
I 
was born. 
I 
suppose I 
must have heard 'em, and being 
naturally of a 
stubborn disposition, I 
resolved to live in 
spite of 'ern. 
Because— 
CHORUS. 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did; 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did ; 
People have such funny ways and sayings now-a-days, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did. 
At last I 
grew to be a 
boy, 
And had to go to school; 
There the master often would declare 
I 
was born to be a 
fool; 
This roused me to activity, 
I 
went to work and strive, 
And whet' examination came 
I 
carried off the prize. 
SPOKEN. — Which surprised every one, because— 
They said I 
couldn't do it, etc. 
THEY SAID I COULDN'T DO IT.—Concluded. 
I, ere I 
married, I 
often said 
I'd have a 
handsome wife, 
And one with lots of money, too, 
To comfort me through life. 
My friends would often laugh and jeer, 
And say sarcastic things; 
Lovers should be allowed to laugh, 
He can afford to laugh who wins. 
They said I 
couldn't do it, etc. 
Three years I 
lived in wedded bliss, 
With but a 
single care, 
To my wife I 
often would remark, 
I 
wish we had an heir. 
My wife would say I 
wish so too 
Above all earthly things. 
Well only fancy last Tuesday week 
She presented me with twins. 
SPOKEN.—It was a 
nine days' wonder; everybody 
shook hands with me. 
It was the happiest day of my 
life. 
I 
was a 
perfect hero, and, egad, so I 
ought to be; 
it takes some people all their lives to get one, but I 
re-
solved to show the world what I 
could do, because— 
CHORUS. 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did; 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did ; 
People have such funny ways and sayings now-a-dayo, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did.

W HEN playing ball the fellows use 
A 
phrase that's just the thing 
To say to pretty damsels, that 
Are always on the wing ; 
It is not all the used up slang, 
Nor " how is that for high," 
But simply is, and nothing more, 
Why, " catch it on the fly." 
ono R 
17S. 
So if you would succeed, my boys, 
In getting what goes by, 
Just throw your shoulders back, my boys, 
And " catch it on the fly." 
While passing down the street at night, 
A 
girl may say to you, 
"Tis chartnimg, ain't it, Georgie, dear 7" 
Or " Gus, how do you do 7" 
Some pretty little flirt, perchance, 
May wink her cunning eye, 
And should you like to walk with her, 
Why, " catch it on the fly."

If on a 
Sunday afternoon 
You at a 
window sit, 
It's no one's bus'ness I 
am sure

But should the female throw a 
kiss 
As she went tripping by, 
'Tis worthless to you lest, my boy, 
You " catch it on the fly,"

Now, friends, my little song is done, 
I

For you to sit in quietness,

Why, call me back and have them all, 
But " catch them on the fly."

IT 
tickled me so I 
liked to die, 
One Sunday afternoon— 
All dressed to kill from head to heel, 
Such a 
handsome little coon. 
When I 
seed de gals, my hat I 
raised, 
And how de white folks stared; 
Dar's little Bob, de nobby soul, 
Out on a 
promenade. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
was slamenading around promiscusly, when 
my ' tendon was ' tracted away by one of de lubliest animiles I 
eber had the opportunity of gazing upon. 
It was a 
female of 
de sassafras complexion, with qe most becornenest dress, and 
de sweetestest waterfalls, and innocernt mouth, and more of it 
dan any gal I 
ever seed before. 
CHORUS . 
All dressed to kill I 
see her still, 
Leaning on de winder sill ; 
She winked her eye as I 
passed by, 
Haugh ! it tickled me so I 
liked to die. 
I 
passed her on a 
block or so, 
But could not stay away; 
She shook her handkerchief after mo, 
Which signified 0. K. 
She smiled so sweet when we did meet, 
I 
thought dat I 
should fly; 
It tickled me so when she asked me in, 
0, golly, I 
liked to die. 
SPOKEN.—But I 
declare to goodness I 
mustn't say much 
more about it, or I 
get to laughing so I 
can't tell you de story. 
All dressed to kill, etc. 
It's just about a 
year ago, 
Since what I 
told transpired ; 
I 
asked her, please won't you be mine ? 
Says she, " if you desire." 
We're going to be married soon, 
You must be sure to be there; 
And 
introduce you all around, 
To the fairest of the fair. 
All dressed to kill, etc.

SOFTLY fall the silv'ry moonbeams 
On the mantled earth of white, 
Casting lines of sweet reflection 
Though the breezy winter's night; 
Dancing thro' the leafless forests, 
Shining on the frozen stream, 
Climbing up and down the hillside, 
Making shadows on the gleam. 
CHORUS. 
Softly fall the silv'ry moonbeams 
On the mantled earth of white, 
Casting lines of sweet reflection 
Thro' the breezy winter's night. 
Softly fall the silv'ry moonbeams 
On the harden'd crust of snow, 
Chasing gems of sparkling beauty 
In the valleys far below; 
Hopping o'er the lifeless bushes, 
Glistining on the village spires, 
Tripping o'er the glens and hedges, 
Waltzing round the woodman's fires. 
Softly fall, 
etc. 
Softly fall the silv'ry moonbeams 
On the mountain tops around, 
Making pictures of the shrubb'ry 
And a 
crystal of the ground; 
Skipping o'er the grassless meadow, 
Prancing up and down the lea, 
Throwing light upon my window, 
Silvery moonbeams dear to me. 
Softly fall, etc.

LIS T night I 
was out rather late— 
'Twas only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be f 
I 
found her in temper and tears; 
Oh! she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears, 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
CHORUS . 
The " Club" had a 
meeting, to-night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight, love; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight, love, 
I've only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
I 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, etc. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her ma; 
While I 
on the mantel- piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she'd let me alone for awhile ; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile. 
SPOKEN.—S0 
I 
thought it a 
favorable opportunity to assure 
her once more, as a 
positive fact, that— 
The " Club" had, etc. 
Written by GEORGE H ERBERT. 
The other evening for a 
walk, 
Thro' Charing Cross I 
strayed, 
And just to pass the time away, 
Went into the Lowther Arcade. 
I 
shall ne'er forget the funny things 
That I 
saw there for sale, 
'Twas there I 
met a 
charming girl 
And she wore a 
bright green veil. 
CaORUS.—She was a 
serio-eomie singer 
From the \Vest- end Music Hall, 
And she quite took this heart by storm 
With her pretty green Parasol. 
As she passed me by I 
heaved a 
sigh, 
She gave a 
knowing wink, 
So I 
offered her my arm and asked 
If she with me would drink ? 
She paused and then replied- " yes, sir, 
I'll have some ice cream soda," 
Then into Gatti's we went, 
And my love I 
quickly told her. 
Spoken.—Yes, and in return she told me it was the same with 
her, as it was with me, love at first sight, but she let me know 
more than she intended I 
could see, and that was, she was going 
to open at " Deacon's 
the next evening, as 
A serio-comic singer, & c. 
Next night, my boys, of course I 
went 
Into Deacon's Music Hall, 
And there I 
saw and heard my love 
As she did loudly bawl, 
But judge of my surprise, 
When a 
fellow rushed on too, 
I 
rushed out of the Music hall, my friends, 
• 
Not knowing what to do. 
Spoken.—Yes, at first I 
intended throwing myself down a 
plug 
hole and drowning myself, upon second thoughts I 
rushed back 
to the chairman and asked him what he knew of her 
he said 
he knew she was lately married to a " Pro," and that she now is 
a 
duetist, but before— 
She was a 
serio-comic, (47.e. 
But now I 
will be off, my friends, 
A broken hearted card, 
For all my hopes are blighted. 
And my happiness is marred. 
But I 
never more will speak, 
To those charming little maids, 
Who try to catch their victims, 
While strolling in Arcades. 
She was a 
serio-comic,

On, fare you well, darling, I 
leave you to- morrow, 
l'm going to take sail for the land of the free; 
Our parting is sad, but, dear, dry up your sorrow, 
Oh, why do you grieve me thus, Kitty McGee 
Do you think 1'11 forget—that I'll e'er prove unfaithful ? 
Oh no, darling, I'll only love you the more; 
I'll write to you weekly, I'll send you my picture, 
And I'll pray for my Kitty, the one I 
adore. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Kitty McGee, with my whole heart I 
love you, 
For you I 
ant going across the dark sea; 
I'll work for you, pray for you, bless you forever, 
And lovingly wait for my Kitty McGee I 
oh, Kitty MoCkee. 
I'll work with a 
will, and I'll save all my money, 
I'll not touch a 
drop of old " poteen" or beer; 
I'll go to church Sunday, and go to work Monday, 
And send you the money to bring you on there ; 
I'll buy me a 
hut, and I'll buy all that's in it, 
And when you are ready to sail o'er the seat. 
Just write me a 
letter, and say that you're coming, 
And I'll wait for my darling, my Kitty McGee.

M UST we then meet as strangers, 
After our dreams of joy 
Oh, must the love we plighted 
One bitter word destroy ? 
Life without thee were lonely ; 
Thou art my spirit's sigh; 
Bid not affection's roses 
Wither and fade and die; 
Oh, must the love we plighted 
One heedless word destroy ? 
Must we then meet as strangers, 
After our dreams of joy ? 
Can we then meet as strangers, 
When we recall the past ? 
Will not ils beauteous vision 
DeAthless in mem'ry last ? 
Give me the smiles of gladness 
Once I 
could fondly claim ; 
Whisper with sweet affection— 
Whisper that once loved name 1 
Oh, must the loye we plighted 
One headless word destroy I 
Must we then meet as strangers, 
After our dreams of joy?
