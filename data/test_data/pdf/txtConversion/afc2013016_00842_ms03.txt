Owner is Mr. Younes Dia. He is of Lebanese ethnicity and came to the US when he was one year 
and half old--approximately 41 years ago 
Parents went back to Lebanon for 6-8 months and then came back to get established brought him 
back when he was 3 
or 4 
years old. 
00:01:20 
He grew up with strong sense of Lebanese culture. Mom wouldn't let them speak English at 
home. She knew they would learn it from friends, so now he can speak both languages. His 
parents came here to Toledo when he came back to America 
00:02:48 
He opened the store about 3 
1/2 months ago. He chose this type of store (a 
specialty shop for 
sweets), because he wanted to for a 
few years. He saw a 
need for one in Toledo.

00:00:03 
It is common for Lebanese stores to specialize in sweets. There is one in Dearborn, MI 
00:00:50 
Found the need for bakery because people didn't enjoy making the drive to Dearborn.

(Small talk between Lucy and Nailam about schedule. Not related to store.)

00:00:01 
Languages used in displaying and naming items in the store. (English, French, and Arabic.) 
00:01:03 
Best selling items are Macaroons and cakes, baklava, and Mamul Med. (a 
cookie-like pastry 
usually filled with dates). 
00:02:42 
Are there any foods that are more popular with the Middle Eastern customers? Americans like 
the baklava, but the Mamul Med is top seller at the bakery. They put a 
twist on it but putting 
pistachios on it. 
It would be more authentic without, but they enjoy it for the flavoring. He 
doesn't want their products to get "old," but likes to give the customers variety. At the same 
time, he feels he needs to be sure to keep the original taste. 
00:06:41 
Price plays a 
role in the choice of ingredients. The pistachios are a 
little more expensive than the 
walnuts more commonly used. 
Cashews are the least expensive of the nuts used there. 
00:07:40 
Questions about peanuts in Lebanon. They have them, but do not use them in baking. They do 
put them in bags of seasoned mixed nuts (machaloota, sp?) 
00:08:12 
Light conversation .... not about store 
00:09:02 
Nailam points out that it's interesting that he has a 
description of what is in the food 
(ingredients). This is unique here because the Middle Eastern people already know so they don't 
care and at grocery stores you don't usually see the descriptions.

00:00:01 
Discussion of food safety (hygiene and sanitation practices). Lucy asks if there any problems 
with the traditional way of making or preserving the food and following American food safety 
rules. 
Yes, for example, the meat pies. The health inspector said they needed a 
special cooler for them. 
They (American health department) didn't understand that it's okay because they're cooked. You 
see them around the world (in Lebanon, etc.) sitting out. It was too much trouble, so they don't 
make them frequently anymore. 
00:01:39 
(Small talk) 
00:02:10 
More discussion on rules 
Food places overseas are more lenient on code [restrictions], for example, the cooler for the meat 
pies. They need to make things easier for small businesses.
