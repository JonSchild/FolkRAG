TONY PASTOR'S WATERFALL SONG. 
As sung at TONY l'AsToR'S Opera House, 201 flowery. 
TUNE—" Dark Girl dressed in Blue." 
ALL you who've ever been in love 
Can sympathize with me, 
For I 
have loved the fairest girl 
That ever you did see ; 
Her age it wasn't seventeen, 
She'd a 
figure straight and tall, 
She dressed so neat, and then 
She wore—Oh such a 
waterfall! 
Chorus. 
The first time I 
met—I 
never can forget— 
I 
went into a 
Broadway store, some handkerchiefs to get 
She stood behind the counter, dressed up like a 
doll :— 
I 
never saw a 
face so fair, or such a 
waterfall. 
wArrnaILL SONG. 
'Twos at a 
pic-nic party 
I 
met her after that ; 
I 
quickly introduced myself, 
We had a 
pleasant chat ; 
And lots of pretty girls were there, 
But none Limong them all 
Could dance with me, except the girl 
Who wore the waterfall. 
The first time I 
met, etc. 
I saw her home, we walked alone, 
I 
vowed we'd never part, 
And as I 
left her at the door 
I 
felt she'd won my heart. 
I heard a 
footstep coming— 
A 
footstep in the hall— 
And all sorts of colors turned girl 
That wore the waterfall. 
The first time I 
met, etc. 
A 
fellow six foot three in height 
Came walking from the room, 
And when he saw me standing there 
At once commenced to fume, 
With looks so fierce, and airs so harsh, 
My heart he did appall. 
' 
This is my husband," says the girl 
Who wore the waterfall. 
The first time ',met, etc. 
Before I 
had time to say a 
word, 
The fellow at me flew, 
And while the maiden held me down 
He beat me black and blue. 
When I 
got up I 
found I'd lost 
Watch, money, chain and all, 
So I 
never since go near a 
girl 
That wears a 
waterfall 
The first time I 
met, eta

(NEW VERSION.)

his Opera House, 201 Dolvery. 
Am—" 
Limerick Races.” 
ONE of the boys am I, 
That always am in clover— 
I'm always up to fun, 
Well known am I 
all over. 
I'm nightly to be found 
At singing in my glory, 
With your smiling face: round— 
Oh, it's then I'm hunkydory 
Fol de rol, eta. 
Now if a 
man is poor 
Rol ttions all will shun him, 
And if he owes a 
bill 
his creditor; will dun him ; 
But let him make a 
hit, 
Then it's quite a 
different story, 
They'll fawning come around 
Just because he's hunkvdory. 
Fol de rol, etc. 
A 
dam ly barber swell, 
He takes to going arter 
A gay Fifth Avenue belle, 
A 
codfish merchant's darter; 
He swears that he's a 
count, 
And she believes his story; 
They meet upon the sly, 
And soon he's hnnkydory. 
Fol do rol, etc. 
A 
greenhorn full of cash, 
Into the city getting, 
Drops in a 
faro bank 
And soon his cash is betting. 
ME TO-NIGIIT, 
MOTHER. 
He loses every time ; 
The banker, in his glory, 
Cries, as he rakes the pile. 
Oh, ain't I 
hunkydory!" 
Fol do rol, etc. 
A 
fist young dry-goods clerk, 
He loves a 
maiden sightly ; 
She being one of the gals, 
He goes to see her nightly. 
His salary i ; small, 
Su from his bosses' store ho 
Rich pre,seuts 
di-es his dear, 
And of curse he's hunkydory. 
Fol de rol, etc. 
In your handiome servant maid 
An interest your taking,— 
Yon drop into your room 
While she the bed is making. 
Your wife then happens in,— 
In vain you tell your story, — 
She soon kicks up a 
scene, 
Saying—" I 
found you hunkydory!'

Written and S7111" hr T 
V PAST'rt. at his OD^ra Tirrig^.. 231 Bow-
ery, while high bounties were being paid, during the late war. 
Air.—" Kiss me Good night, Mother." 
MoTurirt, dear mother, the day has Fecnied long, 
For I 
have done that which some folks call wrong : 
I've raised a 
big pile since I 
left you this morn, 
For I've been bountv-jtunping as sure as you're born ; 
I 
enlisted, you see, with the soldiers to-day, 
The greenbacks I 
got and skedadclled away. 
OUR MUSICAL CLUB . 
To-morrow I'll vamose as soon as it's light, 
But hide me to-night, mother, hide me to-night. 
Chorus the first. 
If I 
go out, rilother, 
I'll surely get tight, 
So hide ma to-night, mother, 
Hide me to-night. 
Mother, dear mother, they thought me a 
fiat, 
But I 
guess they found out what this chicken was at; 
Such a 
large pile of bills is delightful to see,— 
On, you bet there ain't anything_ green about me. 
Perhaps the Provo' guard is after me now, 
And if they should find me there'd be such a 
row! 
I 
don't want with them nor the rebels to fight, 
So hide me to-night, mother, hide ine to-night. 
Chorus the last. 
Well go halves, mother, 
To make it all right, — 
So hide me to-night, mother, 
Hide 1113 to-night. 
OUR MUSICAL CLUB. 
A 
Tip Top Parody. 
As sung by TONY PAgrort, with great applause, at his Opera 
house, 201 Bowery, New York. 
Atu.—" Think of your ilea(1 in the Morning.” 
OUR musical club in the village was held, 
At the sign of the. Cabbage and Shears, 
Where the singers no doubt would have greatly excellgd, 
But for want of taste, voices and ears.

DUD MUSICAL CLUE. 
Still between every toast, with his face shining red— 
What made it so I 
will not mention— 
Mr. President thus, with great eloquence said, 
" 
Pray, gentlemen,sive your attention." 
(Spoken.) Gentlemen of the Independent, Apollonian, 
Incontestable, Unconquerable, Incomparable, and Dont-
careadamnable Vocal Musical Club, you all know the 
roles and regulations of this society. 
Every gentleman 
must sing a 
song, whether he can or not, or else drink a 
pint of salt and water ; therefore to begin this evening's 
harmony, I 
shall call upon Mr. Sniff kins to sing the first 
song. 
SnWicins.—Well, I 
hab a 
dad dold, dut Hi do by dest. 
(Sings snuffling.) 
Am—" 
Rock me to sleep, mother." , 
Blackward, burn blackward, oh blime in dy 
Make me a 
blild ablen dust blor to-blight ; 
Mother, blook black Liam de cboless Llore, 
Block me to bleep  
We'll excuse you, Mr. Sniffkins ; as your head is 
stopped up, we shall allow you to stop up your throat. 
Am—" 
Chanting Benny." 
Thus our club kept up the fun, 
Laughter round us ringing, 
Gaily through the hours we run 
With spouting and with singing. 
Am—'' The Lazy Club." 
Next Mr. Hardy sung a 
song, 
Just four-and-thirty verses long; 
'Twas all about a 
summer's day, 
And chickey birds -upon a 
spray. 
All loudly cried encore, and then 
lie felt inclined to sing again; 
lie said another song he knew, 
That took an hour to sing it through. 
5. 
O'UI% MUSICAL CLUE. 
(Spoken.) Mr. Mungall, will you oblige the company ? 
" 
Well, I 
doesn't care if I 
does ;" so Mr. Mungall 
commences a 
parody : 
Am—" 
The last Rose of Summer." 
'Tis the last drunken bummer, 
Left snoozing alone, 
All his drunken companions 
To the Tombs they have gone: 
No gay politician 
Will come to the jail, 
For to ease his condition 
Or release him on bail. 
Very good, Mr. Mongall ; a 
little of that song goes a 
great way. 
Now we'll have a 
recitation from Mr. Ma-
lone. 
Mr. Malone rises, and in a sweet Hibernian 
accent, proceeds thus : 
Me name is Norvil: on the Grampus his 
Me father feeds his flocks of pigs and ducks— 
A 
fine ould chap, whose only care is 
To 
to 
to  
Begarra, Misther President, I 
forget the rest, but Fll 
sing ye 's a 
song. 
Am—" I 
dreamt I 
dwelt." 
I 
dramet that I 
dwelt in the marabal 
Wid vassals and sarfs be me side, 
I 
had trust at the shebeen of Barney McCall's, 
And an illigant donkey to ride. 
I 
dramet I 
had comrades a 
beautiful host, 
And at forty-fives playing a 
game, 
And I 
also dramet —and it plazed me the most— 
That I 
won the stakes at that same. 
Capital! excellent!

OUR MUSICAL CLUB. 
Am—" Claude Duval." 
Bravo! bravo! very well sung! 
Still the laughter round us rung. 
Bravo! bravo ! very well sung! 
Jolly companions, every one. 
(Spoken.) Now, Mr. lleidensbocker, you're the next 
in order. " Veil I 
viii try vot I 
does mine best, but I 
was so hoarser like a 
hoptoad." 
Am—" 
Jenny with the Light Brown 
I 
dreams bout Jimmy init his prawn pine hair, 
A 
great old vellar vas he, 
He trinks dem schnapps till his eyepalls shtare, 
Un he don't leave noding for me. 
I 
loves de lager un de swietzer kaese, 
I 
loves dem pretzels rare, 
But better does I 
love mine pretty liddle frow, 
Mine Jimmy mit his prown pine hair. 
That's the style. 
Waiter, zwei lager and a dozen 
straws. 
Mr. Dipsey will give us the next harmony. 
" 
Aw, Mistaw President, aw, I'm not much of a 
singaw, 
but howevaw, I 
endeavaw to oblige, aw." 
Am—" Sally come down the middle." 
As I 
was going down Broadway, 
The sunny side, the other day, 
I 
met a 
damsel looking gay— 
It's true, upon my honai.v! 
I 
stopped awhile to have a 
chat, 
-Upon my head I 
got a 
bat, 
She grabbed my watch and left me flat, 
She bolted round the corium. 
"A bad fix, Mr. Dipsey." " So I 
should say, weally." 
After which Ben Tarnystern sings— 
The sea, the sea, the yopen sea! 
A VISIT TO THE SANITARY num 
After which, it being time to adjourn, we all separated 
singing: 
We'll all drink stone blind! 
Johnny, fill up the bowl. 
A 
VISIT TO THE SANITARY FAIR, 
Written and sung with great applause, during the civil war, by 
TONY PASTOR, at his Opera house, 201 Bowery, New York. 
WE'vE got a 
new sensation 
Just now to sing about: 
To benefit our soldiers 
It brings the dollars out. 
The city's all alive with it, 
And I've just been up there. 
I 
went to see the wonders of 
The Sanitary Fair. 
Fol de rol, etc. 
I 
bought a 
ticket, went right in, 
And thought it was all right; 
But I 
had to pay a 
dozen times 
'Fore I 
could see a 
sight. 
But as I 
had some bills along— 
For cash I 
didn't care— 
I 
was bound to go the whole hog 
At the Sanitary Fair. 
Fol de rol, etc. 
Such lots of curiosities 
I 
never saw before : 
One lady fair invited me 
To view her wonders o'er: 
She charged me just a 
dollar, 
And I 
paid her on the square, 
For to see the hairy eagle 
• 
At the Sanitary Fair.

A. VISIT TO TILE SA.NITART FAIR. 
She'd the rudder out of Noah's ark, 
And twenty wonders more, 
And for another dollar showed 
The fig-leaf Adam wore. 
I 
asked her where he put it— 
She at me began to stare— 
She said they didn't tell that 
At the Sanitary Fair. 
Fol de rol, etc 
I 
saw the flag that Jackson raised 
Behind them cotton bales,— 
An old black hat that Abram wore 
When he was splitting rails. 
I 
looked for that Scotch cap and cloak, 
But found they weren't there ;. 
They said he hadn't sent them 
To the Sanitary Fair. 
Fol de rol, etc. 
I 
paid a 
V, a 
bottle got 
Of Spalding's liquid glue, 
I 
put it in my pocket, and 
The fair I 
rambled through. 
I 
heard a 
smash, felt awful queer— 
Lord! how it made me swear! 
The glue was running down my leg 
At the Sanitary Fair. 
Fol de rol, etc. 
With shame I 
dodged behind a 
stand. 
At me the people roared ; 
There a 
lady asked me for to vote 
Upon that army sword. 
My greenbacks stuck together, 
But as I'd a 
few to spare, 
I 
went a 
Ten on Mucky, 
At the Sanitary Fair. 
Fol de rol, etc. 
cui ID'S A MANIKIN. 
Now in our soldiers' fair and fund 
New York must feel a 
pride, 
For the men that's fighting for our flag 
Shall have their wants supplied. 
Their wives and children left behind 
Should be the people's care, 
So spend your extra dollars 
At the Sanitary Fair. 
Fol de rol, etc.

On whack! Cupid's a

Smack on the back he's hit me a

Good Lick! Judy O'Flanakin, 
Dearly she loves nate Looney MeTwoulter. 
Judy's my darling, my kisses she suffers. 
She's an heiress— that's clear, 
For her father sells beer. 
Ile keeps at the sign of the Cat and the Snuffers. 
She's so smart from my heart I 
cannot boult her, 
Oh whack! Judy O'Flanakin, 
She is the girl for Looney MeTwoulter. 
Ochone! good news I

We'd correspond, but laming would choke her. 
Mabrone! I

Judy can't tell a

Judy's so constant I'll never forsake her; 
She's true as the moon, only one afternoon 
I 
caught her a-courting a

Oh, she's so smart from my heart I

Oh whack! Judy O'Flanakin,

WEDLOCK IS A TICKLISH THING. 
TONY'S 
VERSION OF WEDLOCK IS A TICKLISH THING. 
As 
sung by ToNY PASTOR, at his Opera House, 201 Bowery, 
upwards of eight hundred nights. 
'
WEDLOCK is a ticklish thing,— 
Hey merrily ho, and ho merrily hey,— 
And will joys or sorrows bring.— 
Hey merrily ho, merrily hey. 
Oh, how delightful pass their days away, 
Who, never spiteful, only laugh and play! 
(Spoken.) 
Just married.—' Now, my dear, I'm off for 
the office ; take good care of 3
-ourself, my dolly, for I 
am 
so fond of you!" ' Now George, my duck, don't stop 
too long, for I'm going to have such a 
nice dinner, fur 
you know this is the anniversary of my birthday." " I 
shall return my 
angel , on the wine's of love— and a 
Broad-

Good bye, my dear, good bye." 
George, you ain't a-going that way, are you ?'' " Cc;-
tainly, my love ; I'm going out at the door ; what 
would you have me go ?" " George, George, ain't you 
forgot something?" " Forgot something? l've got my

" 
George, you—you

Now let us change the scene,— 
Hey terrible ho, and ho terrible hey! 
Take a

Ho terrible hey, terrible ho! 
Whatever she proposes, be it good or bad, 
He still opposes till he drives her mad.

As sung by TONY PAsTon, at his Opera House, 201 Bowery. 
Alit—" Think of your liead.” 
J.aca dances and sings, and is always content, 
In his vows to his lass he'll ne'er tail her ; 
His anchor's atrip when his money's all spent, 
And this is the life of a 
sailor. 
Alert on his duty, he readily flies 
Where wind3 the tired vessel are flinging;

SALLY or THE BOWERY. 
Though*sunk to the sea-gods, or tossed to the skies, 
Still Jack is found working and singing. 
Chorus. 
To rancor unknown, to no passion a 
slave, 
Nor unmanly, nor mean, nor a 
railer, 
lie's gentle as Mercy, as Fortitude brave, 
And this is the true Yankee sailor. 
'Long-side of an enemy boldly and brave, 
He'll with broadside on broadside regale'her, 
Yet he'll sigh to the soul o'er an enemy's grave, 
So noble's the soul of a 
sailor. 
Let cannons roar loud, burst their sides let the bombs, 
Let the winds a 
loud hurricane rattle, 
The rough and the pleasant he takes as i 
comes, 
And laughs at the storm and the battle.' 
To rancor, etc. 
In a 
fostering rover, while Jack puts his trust, 
As Fortune comes, smiling he'll hail her, 
Resigned still and manly, since what must be, must, 
And this is the mind of a 
sailor. 
Tho' careless and headlong if dangers should press, 
And ranked 'mongst the free list of rovers, 
Yet he'll melt into tears at a 
tale of distress, 
- And prove the most constant of lovers. 
To rancor, etc. 
SALLY OF THE BOWERY. 
Written and sung dur;ng the late war, by TONY PASTOR., at his 
Opera Louse, zn Bowery, New York. 
Ain—" Sally in our Alley." 
OF 
all the girls that are so fair, 
There's none like Sally Lowery; 
She high-heeled gaiter boots does wear, 
And she lives in the Bowery. 
SALLY OF THE BOWERY. 
1D 
I 
go to see her every night, 
In weather fair or showery; 
She thinks of me an awful sight, 
Sweet Sally of the Bowery. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Her father keeps an apple cart, 
And through the streets does cry 'em; 
Her mother keeps a 
peanut stand, 
And bootblack boys do buy 'em, 
And when she dies the peanut stand 
Will be my Sally's dowry. 
I've offered her my heart and hand, 
Sweet Sally of the Bowery. 
The other day I 
took her out, 
The Mu-se-urn to visit, 
And there my Sally fell in love 
With Phineas T. 's " What is it ?" 
The nasty cuss he laughed and grinned— 
At Sally I 
looked sourly, 
As she went up to feel his legs, 
Sweet Sally of the Bowery. 
Since then she's grown quite cool on me; 
I 
fret like all creation; 
She takes the Tribune—off a 
stoop— 
And talks amalgamation. 
No more my fish-balls I 
enjoy, 
Nor taters dry and floury ; 
I'm pining to a 
skeleton, 
, For Sally of the Bowery. 
But I'll enlist in Sickles's Corps— 
I'll go down to Virginny— 
I'll wed a 
darkey wench, and raise 
A 
snuff-hued pieaninny, 
And there endeavor to forget 
Mister and Missus Lowery. 
The apple cart and peanut stand 
And Sally of the Bowery.

Riding crossleged astride, on the back of a 
whale ; 
Which gave him a 
hob 
Into Batlydehob, 
Saying " Phaddy you're welcome to green Innisfail. 
The spalpeens were scared, 
As their saucer eyes stared 
At the Saint with his mitre, his crozier, and book, 
Says one great bosthoon, 
" 
It's the man in the moon, 
And I'll speak to the creature 
By way ef good nature, 
And scrape an acquaintance by hook or by crook. 
I 
hope he can't eat us 
All up like potatoes,"— 
It was Patrick's day in the morning. 
" 
Your wig white as flax 
Makes me bould for to ax • 
It's who are you, what are you, and. from whence you 
come ?" 
Then the other replied, 
" 
I 
came in the last tide ; 
I'm a 
Saint come to save you, and Patrick's my name. 
.\Vith the crook in my hand 
Ill roam over the land, 
And Ill draw yees together like mountain sheep. 
Ili card off the sins 
That stick close in your skins ; 
You'll see what the fun is 
Whole I 
beat tha Dunnis, 
A. beast with long horns, and black as a 
sweep. 
Go lie down in clover 
Till the shrL.,alage is over, 
For it's Patrick's day in the morning," 
With a 
thundering polthogue, 
And the toe of his brogue, 
Soon the Saint kicked the Dunnis beyond the black sea; 
Then he spoke to the nation, 
"My sweet congregation, 
You've spirits remaining that's stronger than he. 
Sure you know what that means— 
They bewilder 
brains— 
They're as clear as the streamiet that flows through the 
green,, 
But stronger than Samson, 
Who pulled posts and lamps on 
His enemies' head 
Till he kilt them stone dead ; 
And the name of the spirit I 
mean is poteen. 
I 
exhort ye, don't stick, sirs, 
To those devil's elixirs, 
Of a 
Patrick's day in the morning." 
The Saint fell asleep, 
And the Firbolgs did creep 
For some crinsk.eens of water unholy but tastely. 
With this essence of sins 
Soon they filled up their skins. 
When the Saint he awoke they were beastly. 
As fuddled they lay, 
Says the Saint, " there's a 
way 
To wean them : I'll mawkish stuff put in each bottle, 
And when they awake, 
If a 
swig they should take, 
Oh dear! ' twill disgust them.. 
I 
think I 
may trust them ; 
They'll vow that no more shall pass down their throttle. 
Something sweet I 
will pour, 
And here something sour, 
On Patrick's day in the morning."

He went off ;—they awoke ;-
Each hot copper did smoke 
Like the flue of a 
steamer; each pounced on his drink. 
Their showing grimaces, 
Their making of faces, 
Beat brick all to nothing ;—but, what do you think ? 
With features awry, 
In a 
hogshead hard by, 
Each emptied his bottle, though dying of thirst, 
Till one dry as a 
sponge, 
At the tub made a 
plunge, 
Where the sour and the sweet 
And the whiskey did meet ; 
And he swigged off this physic till ready to burst. 
By the side of this mixture 
Each man grew a 
fixture, • 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
When Saint Patrick came back, 
" 
Och!" says he, " ye vile pack, 
Of the spawi . of the Druids—ye villainous bunch "— 
But a 
noise as from Babel 
Here made him unable 
To hear his own voice, though he said its the " PUNC11"-
EON he'd have added ; 
' But the Firbolgs were madded, 
Their howls cut short questions, remarks, or reply. 
" 
Aye PuNcit," they roared out, 
With an earth-shaking shout, 
" 
Is the name of this thing 
That is drink for a 
king, 
Or the mouth of a 
Druid if ever he's dry. 
It would coax pipe-shanked Death 
For to let one take breath 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning."

THE LUCKY NEW YORKER, 
As song by TONY PASToR, at his Opera house, 201 Bowery.

AIR—" Betsy Baker) , 
I 
STARTED out once from New York, 
Among the country folks, sir, 
Who always called me " York " for short, 
A 
rather common joke, sir. 
Right hard I 
tried to get a 
place, 
But soon my prayer was granted, 
I 
soon got used to hearing them 
Say " Mr. York, you're wanted." 
Ri too ral In, eta 
A 
gentleman soon hired me, 
I 
found he. was a 
gambler, 
Says he, " I 
want a steady chap," 
Says I, " Sir, I'm no rambler; 
But if you want a 
knovting one, 
By few I 
am supplanted," 
**Oh, that is just the thing," says ho, 
So 
Mr. York, you're wanted."

And if we

Why we'd hp., e
