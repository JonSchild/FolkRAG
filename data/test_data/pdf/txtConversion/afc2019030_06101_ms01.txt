AS: 
Of course! 
 
LG: 
You know you’re being recorded, and I have permission to record? 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Okay. And for the record, can you give me your birth year? 
 
AS: 
Nineteen-eighty-nine. 
 
LG: 
Nineteen-eighty-nine; thanks. 
 
 
What is your current position? 
 
AS: 
Pediatric Anesthesiologist.  
 
LG: 
At the University of Utah? 
 
AS: 
At the university, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Okay; great, thank you.  
 
 
Can you briefly describe, in terms of – sorry, tell the years you went to medical school, 
and where you went –  
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
And residency? 
 
AS: 
Yeah. So, I did medical school at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia; 
and that was four years of med school. And then four years of residency at the University 
of Illinois in Chicago; and then a year of fellowship (Pediatric Anesthesia fellowship) in 
Cleveland, at the Cleveland Clinic. 
 
LG: 
Okay; and what year did you enter medical school? 
 
AS: 
Twenty-eleven, I believe. 
 
LG: 
Twenty-eleven, okay. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
And what year did you start your residency? 
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 3 
 
AS: 
Two-thousand and – so, actually I lied. I probably entered medical school [laughs] 2010, 
and started residency in 2014. Actually, no – I lied; hold on. I graduated fellowship last 
year, sorry [laughs] –  
 
LG: 
That’s okay. 
 
AS: 
This is 2020; so, 2019, I graduated residency. And then I guess before that would be 
2014, is when I actually started then. 
 
LG: 
Started medical school? 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
AS: 
Yeah; brain fart. 
 
LG: 
A lot of people have problems – I think the years kind of tend to blend together –  
 
AS: 
They’re a blur. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
AS: 
You kind of just black out and, you know, because you are just so busy all the time that 
like, you’re just waiting for the next step. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
AS: 
Like time kind of has no meaning. 
 
LG: 
Dates don’t have meaning. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Well let’s start from the beginning. How did you decide to become a doctor? 
 
AS: 
I think growing up I’ve always wanted to be a physician. I was always deciding kind of 
between this and something math-related. And this, honestly, was kind of what I enjoyed 
the most: like anatomy and science. So, I ended up doing this. I actually ended up straight 
from high school matching into an accelerated seven-year program; so, it’s a combined 
college and med school acceptance. So, I did three years of undergrad and then four years 
of med school. 
 
LG: 
I see. And this was at Drexel? 
 
[03:00] 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 4 
 
 
AS: 
So, undergrad I did at Villanova University, in Philadelphia; and then med school, yeah, 
was affiliated with Drexel University. 
 
LG: 
I see. But you don’t come from a medical family? 
 
AS: 
No. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. So, how did you – when you were thinking about becoming a doctor, how did 
you decide in high school for that path? Because that’s pretty young. 
 
AS: 
Yeah, it is I guess. It was always something I’ve just wanted to do. I really liked 
anatomy, and the clinical sciences more-so. Then I did do a summer program, like a 
science-based summer program at Pittsburgh Governor’s School, which you kind of 
explore different aspects of science. And I think just kind of becoming a physician was 
the best fit for me. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Nice. Well can you tell the story of getting into medical school then? 
 
AS: 
I mean, honestly it was kind of back in high school, so it was like pretty far away. I’d 
applied to a bunch of regular programs and accelerated programs. So, the nice thing about 
the accelerated programs is you could always sign up and then drop out if you, you know, 
changed your mind – with no penalty. So, I guess I was kind of accepted back in high 
school. So, it was such a long time ago –  
 
LG: 
Yeah.  
 
AS: 
You know, I’m sure I was excited – it’s just, it’s like a blip, you know? 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. That’s much younger than most other people that I have interviewed before. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Yeah; very different. 
 
 
Well for people who don’t know, what’s medical school like – or what was your 
experience in medical school? 
 
AS: 
It’s definitely difficult. I would say up until kind of medical school, academic life came 
pretty easy to me. The medical school was the first time I, you know, struggled. And 
actually, didn’t necessarily comprehend the material that was being taught, and had to sit 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 5 
 
down (almost every day) and just mentally like rethink through everything, read up 
outside literature just to process everything that was being taught. 
 
[05:15] 
 
LG: 
What was the most difficult thing? 
 
AS: 
Honestly, the most difficult thing about med school is not necessarily the material, but the 
quantity of material that’s kind of being thrown at you all at once. And if you just fall 
behind a day, it’s just so hard to catch up the next day, because you have so much – you 
have a day’s worth of material being thrown at you. And it’s just overwhelming.  
 
 
And for me, I also turned 21 while I was in med school. So, while everyone was in 
college, partying – my experience for that came through med school, so it was definitely 
hard to balance my college friends, who at that point were also, you know, going out, 
with kind of the medical school life of studying. And you’re socially isolated to a certain 
extent. Especially with the way I like to study is, you know, I usually like go into a room 
by myself and just sit there.  
 
 
And for us, our classes were also – you could go in person, but a lot of people (including 
me) did virtual classes. So, the lectures were recorded, and you’d watch them an hour or 
two after the actual lecture. So, it’s very socially isolating.  
 
 
And luckily I was from the area, so I already had a lot of friends from the area; but I 
think, especially that first year, if you don’t know anybody, you know, you become really 
close to your med school friends. But if you don’t know anybody outside of medicine, 
I’m sure it gets pretty depressing. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Can you talk about that isolation a little bit more? 
 
AS: 
I mean, outside the people I talked to on a daily basis would be like my parents or sister. 
My roommate and I, you know, we were good friends, but we were always on a different 
schedule. She was more of the type that would, you know, sleep in and then stay up all 
night studying; versus I would wake up, do my studying and I would be like in bed by 
nine, you know? So, we were always on different schedules. So, you do feel pretty lonely 
sometimes and it’s stressful.  
 
[07:25] 
 
 
I did have a friend who just could not handle it. We had a few friends that just dropped 
out of med school, because it tests your sanity. You might be really smart, but sometimes 
that loneliness can be a big factor in why people get frustrated.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 6 
 
AS: 
Especially at the young age when all of your other friends are getting married, buying 
things and you’re taking out more loans just to go to school, you know? It can be difficult 
not to be able to like socialize, or just go out on town, and not have an income. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. What about the best thing about medical school, or one of your 
favorite things? 
 
AS: 
Honestly, it would be the friends I made there.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
It’s such a good group of genuinely nice people, and you’re hanging out with these 
people – whether you’re studying, or just eating. You get to know people on a whole 
different level. It’s very different from the friends I had in college – where you would get 
to know people because you were hanging out.  
 
 
In med school your time is kind of limited, so even if you’re hanging out studying, I feel 
like you just develop a whole different level of connection with the people you’re friends 
with. And they – honestly, the people that I know – if I ever needed anything, I could 
reach out to and they would help me no matter what.  
 
 
I feel like sometimes when you’re younger you have friends of convenience, where – you 
know, because you’re living in the same dorm room, or you’re in the same sorority, or 
whatever – you become friends by default. Versus in med school, I think you know, 
everyone is very smart, or talented – you kind of pick and choose who is a right fit for 
you. And you just find really good, genuinely nice and good people. 
 
LG: 
Nice. 
 
[09:25] 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Well one of the most kind of iconic classes in med school is gross anatomy, obviously. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
That’s one I think the public is most familiar with. 
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about what gross anatomy was like for you? 
 
AS: 
It was fun. I mean, it’s kind of one of the reasons I went into medicine, I just like 
anatomy in general. And it was – I don’t know if “fun” is the right word, but it was really 
interesting to, you know, apply what you’ve kind of learned for many years (including in 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 7 
 
high school) – like you learn that the liver is right here, or the heart is right here. But it 
was really cool to like dissect everything open and see what it looks like, and kind of 
actually get a face to a name, in a sense. So, it was actually kind of fun.  
 
 
It was interesting, because some things looked nothing like what you would imagine 
them to look like. And then other things –  
 
LG: 
Can you think of an example? 
 
AS: 
I would say just like even nerves – like they’re always depicted as these shiny, like small 
objects; but you know, maybe part of it is the preservative that’s used – you look at it and 
it looks like a piece of string. You’re like, “That’s a nerve? Like I would have cut through 
that if I hadn’t known better,” you know?  
 
 
So, it’s small things – it’s just interesting. You know, everyone has a different – the 
bodies have been donated, and each body has a different pathology, or different surgeries 
that’s been done on it. So, sometimes parts will be missing, and you’ll be looking for the 
parts, and you’re like, “I can’t find it,” you know?  
 
[Light chuckling] 
 
 
And you know, on the flip side, you know nothing about the surgeries, or anything that’s 
been done, or the patient’s personal history. So, there’s necessarily no way of knowing, 
you know, that you’re going to expect this part to be missing, or –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
You know, finding out that you know, the patient had a heart that was backwards, but 
nobody had really picked up on it. So, it’s things like that, that’s just interesting to know 
–  
 
LG: 
A heart that was backwards? 
 
AS: 
Instead of facing a certain direction, it was facing the wrong direction. 
 
LG: 
And that happens sometimes? 
 
AS: 
It does happen; but usually, kind of with all the imaging and everything that’s done these 
days, it gets picked up on. But you know, the patients whose bodies are sometimes 
donated, they might not necessarily have the same access to resources that we do now. 
 
[11:58] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 8 
 
AS: 
So, different diagnoses just, you know, might not get picked up on; it’s not deadly, or 
wrong to have organ parts in a different section of your body than expected. I mean, it’s a 
normal variant, right? 
 
LG: 
I had no idea. 
 
AS: 
[Laughs] 
 
LG: 
That’s very interesting.  
 
[Laughing] 
 
 
Did anyone in your class freak out about gross anatomy, or have any problems with gross 
anatomy? That’s one of the classes that seems to be kind of –  
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
People like it or they don’t. 
 
AS: 
I would say the first like few times you go into the lab, if you’re not used to that smell, 
people will definitely get a little bit light-headed. But once – at least my group – once we 
got used to the smell, the smell would actually make us hungry. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, oh really? 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Why? 
 
AS: 
I don’t know; everyone would just get hungry after the lab – and we all thought it was 
like due to the smell for some reason. 
 
LG: 
How interesting. 
 
AS: 
I don’t know; I don’t know if that’s true or not. We would always just be hungry after 
smelling that smell [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
You might have been hungry because the lab was so long. 
 
AS: 
That’s also a possibility. 
 
[Laughing] 
 
LG: 
Interesting.  
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 9 
 
 
Well can you, then, talk about how you decided to go into Pediatric Anesthesiology, and 
your kind of thought process for making that – 
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
That choice into residency? 
 
AS: 
Yeah. I went into – well so, initially I did four years of residency, just General 
Anesthesia. And I picked anesthesia just because it was a good balance between medicine 
and procedural skills, for me. I liked medicine, but I wanted something that was a little 
bit more hands-on for me. And surgery, I felt like it’s a great specialty, but I wanted a 
little bit more of a work-life balance. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
So, anesthesia gives you a little bit of both. It’s very nice, because it’s one of the few 
specialties that’s very hands-on. I mean, we’re probably one of the few physicians that 
even know how to place something as basic as an IV; most physicians haven’t really 
done that outside of their experience in med school.  
 
[14:10] 
 
 
And then, you know, we place central lines all the time into patients, things like that: it’s 
very unique to our specialty. I mean, aside from surgery and emergency medicine, I’d say 
not many people know how to do any of that. So, I liked the hands-on approach of 
anesthesia.  
 
 
And then with regard to the Peds fellowship, I would say it was more so I just – I really 
liked working with kids, but I wasn’t fully comfortable with them, which is the reason I 
decided to do a pediatric fellowship. And then once I did the fellowship I loved it. It was 
a great program where I trained.  
 
 
We did a lot of complex cases; so, like liver transplants, or multiple organ transplants, 
heart transplants – we did a lot of cardiac cases. We did a lot of just newborn critical care 
cases. And it was vigorous, but it felt like so good to be just doing something that, you 
know, makes a difference; versus, instead of just doing simple lap choles, which you 
know, it does save a life. I just found working with the pediatric population was a lot 
more fulfilling for me.  
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about what your anesthesia residency was like?  
 
AS: 
So, it was in downtown Chicago; we got a lot of the underserved population. So, you had 
a wild range: you had some patients that, you know, are very financially down, and drug 
addicts, and just the whole cabash of patients.  
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 10 
 
 
You had some that are very compliant with their regimen, could tell you exactly what 
medications they were taking, what time they took it. And some patients who just refused 
to even talk to you, or were not in the right state of mind, and you kind of just went into 
the surgery blindly because you had to do the case type of thing.  
 
 
So, I would say the patient population in Chicago is also very different from what I’ve 
seen here. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
[16:28] 
 
AS: 
I’d say the patient population here is definitely healthier, less obese, more active – despite 
their financial background; versus in Chicago, obesity was definitely a huge problem. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
And I feel like my patient population was also a little bit younger –  
 
LG: 
In Chicago, or here? 
 
AS: 
In Chicago; I think that’s maybe just kind of – it was an underserved area, and people, 
you know, might have gotten into trouble in ways that they shouldn’t have, type of 
population.  
 
 
But here, I feel like people are a lot more invested in their health in general. So, it’s kind 
of nice and shocking to just see that: like how involved people are. 
 
 
But residency, overall, I would say the hours were pretty grueling. You averaged about 
70 hours a week. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
And depending on what rotation you were on, you know, you would work a day shift, 
and then you would work a night shift, then you’d go back to working days – which can 
take a toll on your mental health, just because you know, you’re not physically up to par 
everyday sometimes.  
 
 
And then I would say one of the harder parts about residency is that you’re working a lot, 
but sometimes it’s hard to plan anything, because you would only find out your schedule, 
kind of at the end of every month you would find out your schedule for next month. So, 
you know, if you wanted to go do something, you can request the time off; but you’re not 
necessarily guaranteed the time off and you wouldn’t find out, maybe, until you know, a 
week before whether or not you get that time off. So, it’s hard to like book things.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 11 
 
 
AS: 
But I don’t know, I think it was definitely a strong program in the sense that you saw a 
lot, you did a lot, it was very hands-on; but I’m glad it’s done [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Do they have call for anesthesia? 
 
AS: 
Um-hmm, yeah. 
 
LG: 
For people who don’t know, can you describe what a typical call would have been for 
your residency? 
 
AS: 
Yeah. So, call is basically the order in which you go home. So, for us, we had a night 
float person – so, this person would come in around (anywhere between) three to seven 
pm, depending on the day. And you worked all night; and you would finish up around 
seven am in the morning. And then you would go to lecture, and then you would go 
home.  
 
[19:17] 
 
 
If you were covering ICU, sometimes that meant you came in at seven pm, you were up 
all night admitting patients, your shift technically ends at seven – but that’s when you 
sign out your patients, or whatever happened to the day team. And then you have to stay 
for rounds. And rounds can take anywhere from one to three hours. So, you might be at 
work until like 11 or noon; you’d go home and sleep and then come back at seven pm.  
 
 
Sometimes –  
 
LG: 
That same day? 
 
AS: 
That same day.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
Sometimes you’re in a 24, where it’s the same thing: you come in the morning, you are 
awake, admitting patients, taking care of patients until seven am the next day; you stay 
for rounds, you go home, and then you come back and do it again the next day 
(sometimes). So, it just depends what rotation you are on, you know, how long you are at 
the hospital.  
 
So, in general, if you’re in the operating room and you are not the night float person you 
were assigned a call number. So, like if you were fifth call, you would be the fifth-to-last 
person to go home. If you were second call, you would be the second-to-last person to go 
home, and so on.  
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 12 
 
And depending on the size of your residency program, you know, the numbers would go 
up accordingly, based on how many people are staffing the operating rooms. At any 
given time, there are also residents who are not in the operating rooms, and they’re on 
ancillary rotations. So, you know, there is a set number of people in the operating room.  
 
LG: 
Interesting.  
 
 
Sorry, I lost my train of thought – I was thinking about call –  
 
 
Oh, so you were in residency after work-duty hours were enacted, obviously –  
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
In the early 2000s. Was that ever talked about? Because when those work-duty hours 
were implemented it was a controversial change in residency programs. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
[21:24] 
 
LG: 
Did that still – was that conversation still happening when you were in residency, or was 
it –  
 
AS: 
Honestly, no – we all knew they existed, and once in a while you would go over; but then 
the general perception in medicine is that it’s meant to be an average, right, over a certain 
amount of time. So, yeah – you might go over a few months, but then a few months 
you’re under; so, it averages out to whatever certain amount of hours per week that 
you’re working.  
 
 
And honestly, to put it into perspective though, like you know, even if we were working 
more hours, I mean, the surgery residents were working even more; so, I never really felt 
like I had anything to complain about, because there’s always somebody else who has it 
worse than you. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
AS: 
It’s true! 
 
LG: 
That’s sort of the trope in medicine I think [laughs]. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. Especially, I think the people who have it the worst would be like the neurosurgery 
residents. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 13 
 
AS: 
They live in the hospital non-stop. I’m just like – I had a friend who was a resident and 
it’s like, “How are you still like functional? I would just be like a cranky mess all the 
time.” You know, because he would work overnight, and then stay for surgeries, and 
operate until seven pm, or whenever the surgeries finished, and then go home. So, he was 
in the hospital for like over 36 hours sometimes. And you know, I just feel like I would 
be a mess [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. That’s why they do it young [laughs]. 
 
AS: 
It’s still a long time; it’s seven years of training, and then if they go on to do a fellowship 
– I just could not do that [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Can you explain a little bit about your job as an anesthesiologist – what it is you actually 
do? 
 
[23:20] 
 
AS: 
So, my job kind of starts from the moment the patient walk in, up until the moment that 
they’re discharged. So, what that means is once you walk in and you’re admitted, and 
your vitals have been taken, I’ll usually come in, talk to you, get a good sense of your 
medical history, evaluate your airway, put in an IV, and just come up with a good game 
plan.  
 
 
And part of that is tricky, because I’m meeting you for the first time, and I don’t know 
who you are, I don’t know anything about you, unless you have some history in our 
systemic record, kind of. So, if I don’t know anything about you, sometimes it’s a really 
long conversation, sometimes it’s really short. Sometimes I’ll be like, “I don’t think 
you’re a good candidate,” or not a good candidate, but I need more workup. That’s very 
rare.  
 
 
Usually if patients can walk four blocks, or are not coming in for emergency surgery, 
usually the workup has been done. Once in a while it hasn’t, or it’s concerning. I had a 
patient come in with new onset chest pain the night before, and you know, that’s 
something that we’re like, “Well, you should have gone to the ED.” And she was like, 
“Well I figured I was going to see somebody today, so I’d just wait and tell somebody.” 
And you’re like, “No, that’s not how it works.” 
 
 
So, once we kind of do the initial evaluation, we’ll go back to the operating room. And 
my job is to basically monitor you the whole time, and make sure that you’re both hemo-
dynamically stable, and also that I have all the monitors I need to monitor you, and the 
capacity to add monitors on as needed. And also, just you know, make sure that we have 
the right access, that I understand what the surgeon’s doing, and I have the appropriate 
medications I need to do the surgery. 
 
 
So, once we’re in the room, we’ll give you some medications to get you off to sleep. 
We’ll have all of our monitors on before we do that. And once you’re off to sleep,

Page 14 
 
depending on the type of surgery, (assuming it’s general anesthesia) I’ll usually put in a 
breathing tube, or some sort of device to support your ventilation, and let the surgeons do 
their aspect.  
 
 
And my main goal is to make sure that you wake up safely, and everything goes 
uneventfully. And you know, part of that means good communication with both the 
surgical team and the nursing staff. You know, giving blood or any type of crystalloid as 
needed; obtaining additional access as needed.  
 
[26:12] 
 
 
And then once the surgery is over, making sure you wake up smoothly, that you’re 
comfortable in PACU, that your pain is very well-managed – whether that means that 
I’ve given you medications throughout the case, or in recovery room – I help support 
that; or we’ve done some sort of regional anesthetic to make sure that you’re 
comfortable. 
 
 
So, you know, my job is to make sure that you’re taken care of, up until you’re 
discharged from the early anesthetic recovery unit. And you know, it also means that I’m 
also taking care of other patients that either might be inter-op, or pre-op, or post-op that 
also need my attention.  
 
 
 
So, you need to kind of plan ahead the day before – go through your cases, figure out 
who needs extra attention, or extra workup, and make sure that workup is done in an 
appropriate timeframe. And also, just convey your needs to the rest of your support staff 
as well. 
 
LG: 
So, anesthesiologists use that phrase, putting someone to sleep and waking them up? 
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
But they’re not really going to sleep, are they? Can you talk a little bit about what’s 
actually going on? 
 
AS: 
Yeah. We say those terms because we have devices that monitor your EEG activity. And 
the wave forms that you’ll see when person is asleep – we achieve those wave forms with 
anesthesia. And the same thing when you wake up from anesthesia, you see the 
equivalent wave forms as somebody waking up from sleep, which is why we use those 
terms.  
 
 
And you know, I guess it’s a term that we use because it’s relatable, and easily 
understandable. But there’s also really no other good term for it. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 15 
 
AS: 
So, it’s – now that I’m thinking about it, it’s like almost weird; it’s like we don’t have 
another term for it. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Is it true – and again, I’m a lay person – so, is it true that the anesthesia is 
really lowering all the biofunctions? 
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[28:22] 
 
LG: 
Not to the point of death, but almost to the point of death – it really is slowing everything 
down? 
 
AS: 
I think it depends what kind of surgery you’re talking about. If you told me that, I’m 
thinking that, you know, maybe you’re talking about cardiac surgery – where you go in 
cardiac bypass, where everything is slowed down and –  
 
LG: 
I see. 
 
AS: 
The heart is not functioning, so you’re not profusing – I would think that is more closer. 
But then we’re also supporting it extracorporeally –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
So, it’s – our anesthetics put your brain in a state where the brain is, I guess, numb to any 
sensation of pain. You’re not processing pain, you’re not processing any sensory 
information; you can, if we don’t give you enough – it’s like waking up from like a 
twilight zone, where you can feel the pain and sense it. So, our main goal is to make sure 
that you’re not processing any of it. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
And we do that by giving multimodal pain medications, to target different receptors. We 
make sure that the receptors kind of in your nervous system are essentially relaxed and 
blocked, so that you’re not processing anything.  
 
 
So, sorry – I went off on a tangent – what was the original question? 
 
LG: 
No, I just – I was curious about that term “sleep.” 
 
AS: 
Sleep, yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know, versus –  
 
AS: 
Yeah, I guess I would not say it is close to kind of almost dying –  
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 16 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
I would say it’s more like, you know, you’re in a really deep like state of sleep, where –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
You know, sometimes like if you’re exhausted and you go off to sleep, and somebody’s 
like trying to wake you up, and it’s taking them forever? I would compare it more to that. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
I guess I’d feel uncomfortable if somebody said/compared it to kind of dying. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. Well not dying –  
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
But you know, like slowing all those down. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
[30:24] 
 
AS: 
So, I mean –  
 
LG: 
Maybe it’s more like a coma, or something. 
 
AS: 
Yeah, I think I’m a little bit more comfortable to that analogy. 
 
LG: 
Uh-huh? 
 
AS: 
But I would say it’s more like going to sleep, honestly; because we do slow down your 
metabolic rate sometimes –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
But partially it’s because you’re relaxed. Your heartrate and blood pressure can drop 
from our anesthetic, but that’s usually either a side effect of our anesthetic, or it’s because 
you have some underlying pathology – whether it’s trauma, or cardiac disease, or 
something else going on –  
 
LG: 
I see. 
 
AS: 
That’s leading to the hypotension or bradycardia. 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 17 
 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
AS: 
But normally, we don’t see the heartrate slow down, or the blood pressure drop more than 
20%, you know, unless there’s something else going on.  
 
 
And usually, that drop is comparable to whatever drop happens whenever you’re like in a 
deep REM state. 
 
LG: 
I see. It is interesting that there’s no other term then. 
 
AS: 
Yeah, now that I think about it –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
AS: 
It’s kind of – it’s weird, because you know, we say it all the time. And you know, we say 
terms like “intubated” and “sedated” all the time, but there really is no other term for 
them, which is kind of interesting, now that I think about it.  
 
LG: 
So, then you did a fellowship in Pediatric Anesthesiology? 
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Can you explain again (I think I missed it), what was it that was appealing to you about 
the pediatric portion of it, rather than just regular adult anesthesiology? 
 
AS: 
Just the patient population. I just find it very rewarding to work with them. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little about that? 
 
AS: 
Yeah. So, kids – you know, even when they’re born, sometimes they have life-
threatening conditions, their bowel is in the wrong spot, or you know, their bellies 
haven’t formed fully that the bowel is outside the abdomen – so, they can become very 
easily dehydrated. So, one of the things we do is we create a means to eventually put the 
intestines back into the abdomen.  
 
 
Or they’re born with life-threatening heart defects. Or even as they get older they might 
have heart defects that need to be fixed. And they go from, you know, struggling to 
breathe, to like running around. And it’s just rewarding to see. Obviously, that change 
doesn’t happen overnight – it takes some time for them to acclimate to, you know, 
whatever surgical interventions you’ve done.  
 
 
But it’s just rewarding to like see how they grow and they change, and how your 
surgeries can actually change their life. Even if it’s something as simple as like a cleft lip 
or a cleft palate – you know, it changes their confidence, it changes how they perceive 
themselves. Partially, because you know, based on how other people perceive them, 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 18 
 
which is kind of sad to think about. But the surgeries do make a big difference in their 
confidence levels; and not only that, but also like their ability to eat properly. And if they 
can’t be nourished properly, they’re not going to grow properly, right?  
 
[33:43] 
 
 
So, there’s a lot of long-term pro side effects (or not pro side effects, but) good long-term 
prognoses that happens as a result of these interventions. And I don’t know, I just find it 
very rewarding.  
 
LG: 
Nice, nice. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about how you learned to handle kind of the weight of patient 
responsibility? You know, it’s a big –  
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Responsibility –  
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Being an anesthesiologist, and being in charge of that.  
 
AS: 
Yeah, no. 
 
LG: 
It had to have been a learning process? 
 
AS: 
It’s definitely a learning process. I would say [laughs] the first few months of residency 
are definitely the scariest, and then you get comfortable. And then you go on to rotations, 
where you’re like, you know, you’re like frazzled again partially because you realize that 
you’ve gotten comfortable, but there’s so much out there that you don’t know or you 
haven’t heard of – whether it’s because it’s rare, or you’re just kind of getting to these 
more complex patients in your career.  
 
 
So, it’s always – I feel like it’s highs and lows – like you get comfortable, and then you 
come across something you don’t see. And then you’re hypervigilant again. And then you 
get comfortable again, and then something happens, and you’re kind of like hypertense 
again.  
 
 
So, I would say – for me, I don’t think I’m ever fully 100% comfortable –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 19 
 
AS: 
With the weight – only because it’s somebody’s life on your shoulders. So, even if I get 
comfortable, you’re still like – there’s always like something in the back of your head 
that’s still like flashing red, just because it’s somebody’s life, and if something ever 
happened, I think I (personally) would find it very difficult to live with (if it had been due 
to like negligence or something on my part).  
 
 
Obviously, there are some cases where you do everything right, and it’s just the prognosis 
is a bad prognosis, and there’s not much you can do. And I think sometimes, you know, 
those cases are hard to deal with.  
 
 
But the hardest ones to deal with, I think (personally, at least for me) are the ones where 
you’ve done everything right in an otherwise stable patient, and you can’t figure out, you 
know – something happens: like either you have a lot of bleeding, or you know, the 
patient has an arrhythmia, or something. And you know, you do everything you can, but 
it’s just you can’t stabilize the patient. And that happens in everyone’s career at some 
point. And I think those cases are the ones that just kind of live with you forever.  
 
[36:22] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. Yeah, that’s one of the things, that you know, doctoring is quite 
different than other occupations, is there is that weight of patient responsibility –  
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
And you know, not all specialties deal with life and death issues, but you know, even 
primary care –  
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
A little bit, you know, have to watch out for things [laughs] –  
 
AS: 
Um-hmm, yeah. 
 
LG: 
And ideally pick up on them. But you know, it’s a big responsibility. And as I’ve been 
doing these interviews, I’ve wondered more and more about how people learn to deal 
with that responsibility. Because I don’t have that kind of responsibility –  
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
In my work. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. It’s honestly very hard, and I think sometimes like I have to go home and just turn 
off my brain for a little bit, because otherwise, you can just sit there and ponder all day 
like, “What if? What if? What if?” Right? And even though you’ve done everything right, 
sometimes it’s just – it is what it is and there’s nothing you could have done to change it.  
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 20 
 
 
So, for me (personally) like I go home and I just kind of detach from work a little bit 
sometimes and you know, either go for a run, or workout, or catch up with a family or 
friends. Especially having friends who are in anesthesia, I think it makes it a little bit 
easier to like just call and talk to them. And they understand – they’re like one of the few 
people that truly understand like what’s on your mind, and have a good idea of like, you 
know, how to distract you, or why you’re thinking the thoughts you’re thinking type of 
thing.  
 
 
Yeah, mostly it’s – and I also like to cook, I think it’s a great distractor for me, I love it 
[laughs]. So, I’ve been making a lot of cheesecake since COVID started. But, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Was that something you had to learn – to get distracted at home, or to leave your work at 
work? 
 
[38:23] 
 
AS: 
Yeah. Otherwise, you know, you’re going to get caught in the past. And you know, 
whether you like it or not, you have to get up and go to work the next day, and there are 
other patients that need your attention. So, even if you aren’t feeling up to par, or feeling 
a little bit crappy – you still have to put it aside and you know, do your job. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
 
Did you feel, as a female, that there were any barriers that you had to overcome in med 
school, or in your training, or in your specialty? 
 
AS: 
Yeah. I would say two things going for me: I’m a female; but also, I’m pretty petite, so I 
feel like I don’t get taken seriously – both by the patients, and sometimes by the residents 
(not so much the female residents, but the male residents once in a while). And I think 
partially it’s just because I look so young. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
I am young, but I look younger than I am. And I think, you know – I’ll be in a room with 
the patient and I’ll introduce myself as Dr. So and So, and I’ll have a med student or 
resident with me, and it’s like kind of sometimes the patients, I feel like they just glaze 
over and they look at whoever is with me, like expecting answers. And I’ll answer it, but 
they’re not looking for answers from me, they want it from the other person. And I think 
that definitely does frustrate me a lot.  
 
 
But then I also don’t want to come across as too like pushy, or uptight. I don’t know, I’m 
a pretty laid-back person, and I feel like I don’t really want to change who I am just to be 
taken seriously. So, I think that’s something that, you know, I’m still trying to find a good 
balance between. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 21 
 
 
AS: 
But yeah, not getting taken seriously has definitely – it’s something I’m working on. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
 
One of my own personal research interests is humor, and the use of humor in medicine –  
 
AS: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about humor and anesthesia? 
 
[40:43] 
 
AS: 
Yeah. I mean, the surgeons are always making fun of us, so we always make fun of them 
[laughs].  
 
LG: 
There’s like a rivalry there, isn’t there? 
 
AS: 
Yeah – it’s a friendly rivalry, I would say [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about that? 
 
AS: 
Oh, I mean – everyone always blames anesthesia for everything (jokingly). So, you 
know, we make our own jokes back at people. But I would say humor is probably 
(honestly) one of the best ways to deal with the stressors we have in our day-to-day life. 
And especially because we do work by ourselves, mostly.  
 
 
It’s different from other medical fields where, you know, you work together as a team, 
you round as a team. You’re kind of making plans by yourself, interacting with surgeons 
by yourself. So, you know, you relate to other people through humor, I guess. 
 
LG: 
Can you give an example of the joking that occurs between (maybe) anesthesia and 
surgery? 
 
AS: 
I can’t think of anything off the top of my head right now [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, that’s fine; it’s hard to think of things –  
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
I know that that rivalry exists, you know? 
 
AS: 
It’s friendly, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 22 
 
AS: 
Now it’s friendly – I’m sure back in the day it was probably a little bit more intense. But 
now, I think, the culture of medicine, you know, is changing slowly, but surely. You 
know, back years ago it was more of a, you know, “You’ll do exactly what I want you to 
do,” type of thing; versus now, I think younger physicians are more comfortable asking 
questions and saying, “Well, why can’t we do it this way?”  
 
 
Versus years ago, you know, the physician would tell the patient what to do, and the 
patient would just do it; versus now it’s more of a relationship. The attending physician 
could tell the residents, “I want this done,” and nobody would even question it; and now, 
it’s more of like – there are less more rigid boundaries –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
And there is more room for kind of, I think, interaction – which allows for growth on 
both the attending physicians and the residents’ parts. And also, in the physician-patient 
relationship because I think, you know, you can learn something from someone all the 
time.  
 
[43:01] 
 
 
So, I think there’s more room for growth – both personally and professionally in 
medicine now, which is kind of nice.  
 
LG: 
It is nice. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
More dialogue, it sounds like? 
 
AS: 
Yeah, dialogue – that’s a better word. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
 
One of the things I’m also interested in is like the stereotypes among specialties –  
 
AS: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
So, one of the stereotypes of anesthesiologists – well I’ll ask you that: what are they? 
 
AS: 
Yeah. [Laughs] We have a few. People think we just sit there and sleep.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
Or sit there and drink coffee. Or I think we play like crossword puzzles or sudoku, or 
some sort of game – but we’re not; we’re paying attention [laughs]. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 23 
 
LG: 
Why does that exist, or why is that there? I know it’s not true –  
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
But why is there that perception? 
 
AS: 
I mean, there are certainly cases where it probably looks like we’re sitting there doing 
nothing. But you know, we’re pretty vigilant, I would say, almost all of us here. Not only 
do you use your eyes, but you have to use your ears as well, to tune into the different 
noises. Because each you know, vital – for instance a pulse-ox has a very distinctive 
sound. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
So, even if your back is turned and you’re doing something else – whether you’re putting 
in an IV, or readjusting something on the patient – you have to be able to pick up the 
nuances and the change in the tone that can happen if a patient, let’s say, desaturates, or 
something happens. 
 
 
But I’m sure it looks like to other people that we’re just sitting behind the drapes, doing 
nothing. Which you know, I can totally understand. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
But on the flip-side, like when stuff does happen, like people rely on us to, you know, 
whether it’s run the code, or figure out what’s wrong and why the patient is not stable. 
So, I think we see both sides of the pendulum, where you know, it looks like we’re doing 
completely nothing, to we’re running the show.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
So, I can see where that perception comes from. 
 
[45:02] 
 
LG: 
That’s interesting about the auditory –  
 
AS: 
Yeah, you – especially when you first start working, where you have a really involved or 
complex case, you’re going to hear that noise in your sleep sometimes [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
Especially when you first start – you just hear the noise of the pulse-ox in your sleep. 
Because it’s very loud in the operating room.  
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 24 
 
LG: 
Well plus, the surgeon is there with maybe the residents – and you’re probably a little bit 
back? 
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
So, they’re not necessarily paying –  
 
AS: 
Oh, yeah; usually they don’t pay attention to the vitals.  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
AS: 
But you know, to be fair – the vitals aren’t facing them, they’re facing us (usually). 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
But I would say yeah – the surgeons, especially if they’re teaching, right, they’re not 
going to be focusing on what my job is, and vice versa. And then aside from that, I mean, 
the surgeons might be talking to each other or the residents; there’s usually music playing 
in the background; the nurse might be on the phone, trying to line up the next patient, or 
you know, get whatever the surgeon needs.  
 
 
Meanwhile, if we have a resident or are teaching somebody, we’re talking in the 
background as well. And then plus the noise of the, you know, suction, and what other 
device is being used in the operating room – it gets very loud. 
 
LG: 
There’s a lot going on. 
 
AS: 
There’s a lot going on, yeah.  
 
LG: 
Okay. Can you talk a little bit – I’m also interested in the issue of suffering in medicine –  
 
AS: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
And a lot gets talked about in terms of patient suffering, obviously, because that’s the 
reason –  
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
For existence of medicine. Can you talk a little bit about your own experiences –  
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
With suffering – like from a work perspective, or from a physician’s perspective. 
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 25 
 
LG: 
I guess my question is has doctoring ever caused suffering for you? 
 
AS: 
I guess in terms of like a work-life balance, or in like mental trauma? 
 
LG: 
You’re a witness to suffering, obviously –  
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Which I think sometimes can cause –  
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Suffering on the part of care providers. 
 
AS: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
I think the workload is very difficult. You know, however you want to think about it, or 
talk about it. 
 
AS: 
Yeah; I mean, sometimes there are cases that come to the operating room, where it takes 
up a lot of energy from you to keep that patient stable; or just even prevent them from 
dying. But you know that the long-term prognosis is not going to be well. And I think, 
you know, it takes up so much energy to take care of these patients. And you know, it’s 
hard sometimes to follow up with the patients and know that they’re either no longer 
there, or are still struggling.  
 
[48:05] 
 
 
Just because, I don’t know, I think one thing being in medicine is that quality of life 
matters. And I think people outside of medicine, if you’re given an option of prolonging 
life – most people choose to prolong it. We’ve kind of just seen the way patients suffer, 
and how much their quality of life decreases.  
 
 
You know, I always just jokingly say like, “Yeah, I wouldn’t want that done; I’d rather 
die.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
And it’s easy for me to say that because I’ve seen the patients suffer. But for a lot of 
families, when they have somebody who is suffering, it is the first time they’re going 
through it as a family, and they don’t realize how much of a toll it takes on the patient, 
and also on the family – both emotionally and physically. And it’s not a way I think I’d 
personally want to live. I would not want half the interventions that we do on these 
patients; but it’s also because I’ve seen the outcomes I think, and seen people suffer that I 
wouldn’t want it done. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ashka Shah 
Page 26 
 
 
But if you talk to a lay person and ask them, you know, “Would you want to be kept alive 
on a machine, artificially, for you know, until your lungs recover or you can get a new 
pair of lungs,” or something – that’s probably a pretty bad example. But I feel like I 
would probably pull the plug in my own life (personally) a lot earlier than people outside 
of medicine would, just because you’ve seen the suffering. 
 
LG: 
Because you can see that? 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
 
But I would say with regard to like a work-life balance, just touching up on what I said 
earlier – very socially distanced, but you know, sometimes you have things come up that 
you are very emotionally invested in, but you can’t go. Like when I was on call a few 
weeks ago, my grandmother was admitted to the hospital in Chicago and I was working 
overnight. And she was not doing well, and I had a patient come in, in a similar situation 
as her. And honestly, I was like a mess. It was just –  
 
[50:14] 
 
LG: 
Because it felt close? 
 
AS: 
Yeah, like my grandmother was, you know, coding on the other side of, you know, versus 
on the other side, like you know, I’m trying to save somebody who is kind of her age, her 
profile, her past medical history – like try to save her life, while my grandmother is 
passing away, you know? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
AS: 
I think it’s the type of job where you can’t just say, “Well I’m going to go just, you know, 
call it a day and leave,” you know, at ten pm at night. You know, if I do that one of my 
co-workers has to come in, and you know, they might not have planned on working that 
night. So, it’s a lot of responsibility in that sense. And sometimes you can’t do things you 
want to do just because of prior commitments to work. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. That sounds difficult. Yeah, one of the things I’ve learned in this project is the 
number of physician suicides – the physician suicide rate is very high. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Which I didn’t know before I started.  
 
AS: 
Yeah. I think especially for anesthesia – the burnout rate is maybe not as high as in other 
specialties; but the potential for drug abuse is very high. 
 
LG: 
Right; and that would make sense.

AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
AS: 
And partially, as bad as it sounds: we have easy access to it. And if you are somebody 
with an addictive personality – you know, whether you’ve had surgery for something else 
and you’ve tried the narcotics, or what else – it can have bad outcomes. And you know, 
that’s something that we’re educated on, kind of from when we first start our residency, 
to constantly being vigilant and making sure that a: you’re emotionally and physically 
okay; but also, that your co-workers are. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
Because I mean, you have a job to yourself, and you have a job to the patients. And you 
can’t take care of the patients if you’re not taking care of yourself. And unfortunately, 
with anesthesia it’s one of the (probably) specialties with the highest rate of drug abuse. 
And just being vigilant and keeping an eye out for that is very important. So, you know, 
that’s like pharmacy is very important in that sense. 
 
[52:32] 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
AS: 
Some places, you know, test whatever you return to make sure it’s the correct amount. 
You know, we’re randomly drug tested. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
So, you know, there are checks; but there’s also (I’m sure) a high rate of – not high rate, 
but there is a proportion of people who, you know, manage to bypass the system, and 
eventually get into trouble. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm.  
 
 
Do you – in your training, or in your work environment, do they ever talk about self-
care? 
 
AS: 
We do. I think it’s a topic that’s pretty well talked about, and it’s easy to talk about it. But 
it’s one of those topics that you’re like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.” But it’s not necessarily 
easy to apply into your life, when you’re working 60-70 hours a week – you don’t 
necessarily have time for self-care. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
AS: 
Sometimes you do, and it’s great. Sometimes you don’t.

LG: 
Um-hmm.  
 
 
Well what kind of advice would you give to somebody who was thinking about going to 
medical school today?  
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Or what would you tell them? 
 
AS: 
I would say it’s a very long road, but if you’re passionate about what you’re doing, it’s 
worth it. Yeah, I think I would say that. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
It’s very rewarding to do what I do. It can be very scary and sad sometimes. But if you 
are very invested in what you are doing, and you’re doing it for reasons that are for, you 
know, self-growth, or just because you have a passion for it – I think you’ll be happy. But 
it’s a huge commitment.  
 
 
You know, it’s not a commitment that should be made lightly, especially because you are 
sacrificing, you know, kind of your peak years: your 20s and your 30s, before you 
actually start working. So, I would say in that sense, it’s a huge time commitment, but it’s 
worth it. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
 
And what else would you want, you know, the public to know about being, maybe let’s 
say a physician, but maybe an anesthesiologist in particular? 
 
AS: 
I mean, we’re there with you 24/7 that you are either in surgery or recovering from 
surgery.  
 
 
It’s funny because we don’t necessarily have a personal relationship with the patients in 
the sense that they’re not going to follow up with us in clinic, we don’t meet them 
beforehand – we meet them the day of, and they’ll probably never see us again. But we 
are the ones that kind of have the biggest role in making sure that everything is okay, and 
that you’re well taken care of during the surgery and after the surgery. But we’re also the 
ones that are the first forgotten. 
 
 
So, it’s weird because you know, we don’t have a personal relationship; but 
professionally, we are the ones most invested in making sure that you do okay. 
 
[55:49] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. Interesting. And did you know that going into anesthesiology – that 
you wouldn’t have that kind of continuity with a patient?

AS: 
Yeah. I don’t think I appreciated it as much, initially; but definitely you do realize that 
pretty quickly. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
AS: 
And for some people, you know, they love that; they love just being able to see a patient, 
help them on, and then move onto the next patient. Versus other people, who do want that 
continuity: they go in to like pain, or another sub-specialty where you can a little bit more 
continuity. 
 
LG: 
I see. 
 
AS: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
I guess that’s good. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Great. Well thank you very much. Is there anything else that you would want to add, or 
that you think is important to know? 
 
AS: 
I don’t know –  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
AS: 
I think we’ve covered it all. 
 
LG: 
Okay. I’m going to do a closing tag. 
 
AS: 
Okay. 
 
LG: 
Again, this is Lisa Gabbert; today is July 21st, 2020. And I just finished an interview with 
Dr. Ashka Shah, here in Liberty Park, in Salt Lake City. 
 
AS: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Thanks again. 
 
AS: 
Yeah, thank you.
