TEXT: 
I was born about a quarter of a mile from here, 
in 
Morella, and way back then, 42 years ago, I was born in a house, 
asn 
even born in a hospital like most people, and th e 
expressway wasn't here, most of this was Dairy farm, but all 
between here and Harvey Canal, all that was still swamp, even up 
to ten or twelve years ago it was still swamp 
MH: Lots of cypress? 
DH: Cypress, a lot of bottom hardwood, and then cypress 
swamp and then some marsh -- see, you on the Bayou de Famille 
Ridge right now -- Bayou de Farnille used to come through here, 
so this is a high area -- then you went all the way back over to 
what would be like the Barataria Ridge -- or even on the river 
1 
ridge, which is all high grounds on the ri ges close to the 
d  
waterways -- so yo u have r ight between Bayou de Farnille; and 
Barataria you have bottom hardwoods on Bayou de Farnille Ridge 
then a transition area where it goes in the cypress swamp then it 
turns into marsh and you go back up into a swamp area back into 
bottom hardwood again, and it's like that along each waterway, 
the river ridge -- you got the river on the west side of you, on 
the north side of you, and on the east side of you -- it's like 
this, and so the high ground along the river, `which would be the 
river ridge -- then the low bayous that was in.betw-en -
Barataria waterway, BayoC Cygnet-,)-- well Bayo. Cygnet - idn't 
really have a high rid a around it -- Bayou de 
i le 
MH: What does 
gnetean? 
DH: I' rn not s 
I only speak a little crench, not a lot 
MH: Were they all natural Bayous? 
- 
DH: Well, that's what I'm talkin about -- the natural bayous 
the manmade ones were dust canals cut through marsh areas- 
swamps -- and the only thing you'd have there would be a sprawl 
bank -- a levee,_ so -- But that's not the areas people lived . ii• 
see most of the land in here is dry, they drained it -- it WAM 
W, 
swamp but they drained it because of the levee systems -- all. 
this would still be wetlands because of the back water comin in 
from the backside of us 
MH: Have you lost land because of that? 
DH: It's subsidin and shrinkin -- but the river doesn't flow 
through here anymore -- it doesn't throw over its banks and 
redeposit the silt, so we gradually sinkin in the ground, and the 
soil type that they have here looks like a sponge and as it dries 
you gradually sinkin and the ground, and as it dries it shrinks, 
but they keep it dry with the pumps -- like, we just had that 
hurricane here, Juan, people flooded because the back levees 
wasn't high enough to keep the tidal waters out. 
It wasn't from 
rain, 
it was from high tides that came over the levees --
sometime when we have a bad hurricane it's the opposite --
because that wasn't a bad storm, what it did was it sat out in 
the Gulf for like about four days, and it was bringin 
southeasterly winds -- which was bringin the water in from the 
Gulf into the back bays and out -- and if we get a bad storm 
that's got a lot of rain, the levees have a different effect -
they trap the water in because the pumps can't keep up, 
but this 
wasn't from rain, 
it was from high tide. The levees wasn't 
sufficient to hold it back, plus they broke and this and that --
we have a lot of people get flooded. People were lucky because it 
wasn't a bad storm -- I guess the wind was 75 mph or something --
you can net a hurricane here with 180 mph winds, and in a storm 
like that the tidal surge would be so great, they would have 
water all the way up the river. 
MH: I was impressed with the way Juan rearranged the marshes 
-- it looked like he threw it around like pieces of carpet 
DH: Well I used to work across the river in an oil field 
over there -- called Cock's Bay, and they had a hurricane come in 
there while I was workin over there, you couldn't even find the 
waterways afterward because the marsh grasses were uprooted and 
it covered the waterways and all', 
so everything just looked the 
same, you know. You couldn't tell where you was at. 
MH: When you were growing up around here, who lived here? 
DH: It's hard for me to say -- there wasn't nowhere near the 
amount of people you have now -- everybody lived along the river 
-- and like in Lafitte along the Bayou de Famille Ridge and the 
Barataria -- people were more confined to the rid 
other than 
those that lived out in camps and all like 
Dennis. (?) and all 
•• Ygnet 
r Bayou St.. 
, people that trapped and 
a for a living 
-- I'll take you to meet some people. They would live in 
Crown Point, and then when trapping season would open.they would 
literally close the schools -- everybody would go to the trapping 
camps, kids and all, . and -- 
Well, trapping season lasted three months, from December, 
January, February -- it ends in the beginning of February -- so 
they'd pull ' em out of school and they wouldn't come back in 
until the trapping season was over -- they would finish 
I started to fool around with it when I was a kid -- but I 
never did any serious trappin until I guess I was in my twenties 
MH: What did you do between fooling around with it and 
serious trapping? 
i 1 0 i 
i 
DH: A little bit of everything -- longshoreman on•the river, 
oil field worker, pipefitter, welder, anything to turn a dollar 
-- I did a lot of huntin -- but we won't go into that -- a lot of 
it was poachin, and it still is a way of life around- here, 
unfortunately -- there wasn't a lot of people in the area, so the 
impact on the animal population wasn't that great, cause there 
wasn't a lot of people doin it, 
but now you hear so many people 
movin in the area, and they hunt for sport•or they poachin, but 
there's not that many serious poachers here, but there's too many 
people puttin too much demand on the land, so it's hurting the 
area, but a long time ago they wouldn't even bother you if you 
went and shined rabbits at night -- it just wasn't a big deal, 
but now you're lucky if you can even hunt rabbits, there aren't 
as many as there were -- that's why it's no good no more -- it's 
a thing of the past -- same thing if you want a deer -- when I 
trapped if I needed meat I'd kill a deer and that was my meat, 
but now people just kill em to be killin em -- and believe it or 
not, there's more deer here now than there ever was -- well, 
it 
has a lot to do with draining the land, the habitat's better than 
it was -- before when it was all swamp they didn't have any food 
supply 
MH: When is deer season? 
DH: It opens in October for archery, and it opens for gun in 
November, and goes on up into January -- I think there's about 
fifty two or fifty six days -- in this area -- in different areas 
they got it set differently because of population -- so they'll 
have a longer season in an area where there's a lot of deer --
like here you're allowed to kill six a year -- most people don't 
kill that many -- the state figures it out
.-- they allow you to 
hunt what's considered a surplus --
MH: When you were growing up did people calculate how many 
muskrats or deer they could take? 
1 
DH: No, only what was sold as hides -- that was one way of 
1 
keepin track -- the old man I'll take you to, he used to catch 
300 muskrat a day -- 
they got ten cents, fifteen cents for ern. 
And there's hardly any left, and it's not because of 
overtrapping, it's because of the destruction of habitat - that's 
what's cut back on them -- I like to hunt, see, and a lot of 
people's really down on hunting -- hunting is a way of controllin 
populations -- and you have some control there -- destruction of 
habitat, you have no control, that's the worst thing in the world 
-- now I'm not gonna say some animals haven't been hunted to 
extinction, because they have -- but the biggest problem is the 
destruction of habitat -- you destroy the habitat, and,I don't 
care if you don't have anybody out there huntin you're gonna lose 
the animals. 
MH: What would the yearly cycle be for hunting and trapping? 
DH: Here.? Well, you're in the city now, and peoples' always 
lived here like they did in any other city -- or they commuted to' 
the city. 
In this particular area here you had a lotta people 
that fished for a livin, trawled or caught catfish, trout, and 
hunted during the winter months, they just lived off the land --
farmin -- there was a lotta farmin, a lotta dairies here at one 
time -- but further back, south of here, most of those people 
trawled for a -livin and trapped and all during the winter months. 
3 
MH: Trawling would happen in the winter too? 
DH: Yeah, some of it's in the winter, but it works 'out' just 
about right, you know -- you have May season and August"season is 
split now -- back then I'm not sure how it was, but it's somethin 
you do in the summer months, and it goes on into the winter 
months -- you get brown shrimp during the summer and then later 
in the year you got the white shrimp come in -- there's more than 
two kinds, but those are the two most valuable commercially --
people fish turtles -- alligator snapper, regular snapper 
MH: What's the difference? 
DH: Snappin turtles you can trap em with the hoop nets 
you can do that with alligator snappin turtles too, but the best 
way to catch them is to bait lines, and you hook ern -- you just 
go in back areas -- in the type of habitat they like and set 
lines all over -- same thing with catfish, you just kinda --
one area might be good one year, and another area might be good 
the next year -- it varies. It's the same thing with trappin. You 
might have a good year trappin, and then you may have a bad year. 
It's somethin you have to like to do, to do it. Trappin's cruel, 
cause they use foot traps, 
it's a cruel way, but it's most 
efficient. 
Any time you can water set a trap you're better off if you 
can drown im -- you know, that way there's less chance of him 
escapin, plus it's a lot more merciful to him, really, but it's 
not always possible to water set a trap -- like out in the 
marshes there's not enough water to drown ern, 
in the grasslands 
you know -- so they stay in the traps till you come and run the 
traps, which legally you're sposed to run em everyday, and if you 
don't run em early you lose a lot of animals, so you should run 
em early in the mornin every day -- you lose less animals, cause 
they'll chew their legs off or tear their legs loose or whatever, 
so you check all your traps every day. At one time you could set 
as many traps as you want. You can't any more, I forget what the 
limit is -- it's a hundred fifty, two hundred traps --
MH: Do you put your name on every one of em? 
DH: In the park you would mark ern 
MH: Do you have to use different methods in the park than 
you would outside the park? 
DH: Yeah -- to some extent -- you really handicapped in the 
park, because of some of the regulations they have -- really 
makes it hard for you to trap 
MH: George was saying that they don't allow burning 
DH: Right, they don't allow burning, you're not allowed to 
cut any vegetation, which you need for stakes.,and all,to stake 
your traps down, and you gotta bring em, so that's more work to 
bring poles; you're rot allowed to dig any tranaghes 
t"trainasses"> other than to keep the old ones open, so that 
means you gotta trap by foot, which is, that's how I used to 
trap, I didn't use ditches, most of the trappin I did was 
travellin through the marsh on foot 
MH: Did you have a pattern you would use? 
DHz Yeah, you do it systematically -- you start on the 
outside -- and start closin in,.or you run a line of traps out to 
the marsh and circle back to a given ar ea so th a t you wind up , 
back where you started -- you might have, 
it depends on how lung ' 
4 
J 
you take 
you might have five, ten, fifteen different strings 
of traps that you're rennin -- it used to take me from dark to 
dark to run em usually and then get home and clean em after -- by 
the time three months are up you ready ( laughs) 
MHz Better than aerobics 
DH: It'll take the weight off you -- a lot of people just 
trap in tranaches, and do very little walking, but then it's a 
lot of work to dig the tranaches ( trainasses), but if you have a 
lease that you been trappin for years, you continuously trap, 
then every year you maintain those trainasses and maybe add one 
through the years -- they got a machine they call a trainasse 
digger -- it's somethin that the local people come up with --
MHz Can they dig trainasses in the park? 
DH: No --- they have some, but they're old ones, so you 
allowed to keep them open if you have that lease -- but you also, 
the old, it's just a ditch -- they also dig em by hand, most 
people used to dig em by hand -- then you take a potato rak e - 
:, 
you know what a potato rake is? Potato fork? It's a three pronged 
-- and you just dig the rootballs out, cause that's all there is 
-- the top part of the marsh is just vegetation -- it's 
rootballs, so you just dig a ditch -- it's tiresome and it's 
hard, but it's not like digging with a shovel -- you keep 
dragging the stuff out and then you dig a ditch --
mm: Doesn't the water start coming in while you're digging 
DH: Sure 
MHz (Well, there is duck potato on the marsh) 
DH: That's sagiitprius -- I forget the scientific name -
it's pretty good to eat 
MH: How about muskrat, does anybody eat that around here? 
DH: You're lookin at one -- I used to cook em with turnips 
and all -- smother ern and cook ern with turnips. I also eat 
nutria, nutria's really good. I made stew, 
like a sauce picante 
-- red gravy with em, spicy red gravy -- I'll barbecue 
MHz Do you cook the muskrat and nutria together? 
DH: No, separate 
MHz Is the taste very different? 
DH: Oh yeah -- nutria's better meat than muskrat -- you ate 
muskrat? 
MHz yeah -- it was gamey 
DH: Well, it's the same thing with any kinda wild food -- if 
you don't know what you're doin with it, 
then -- I mean, you can 
ruin a piece of beef meat, so you know what you can do with 
somethin wild -- last night I ate deer. I cooked some deer a 
while back -- they had a party at Dave Lampert's house for the 
park, so I brought sgme deer meat, 
I'd already seasoned it, 
and 
what it was, 
it was the loins in the back, and it was really 
good, you know. They just gobbled it up -- but I've eaten deer 
meat that people cook, and you couldn't eat it because they 
thought they was foolin with a piece of beef meat, and you can't 
do that. Deer meat's real dry, and you can't just salt and pepper 
it and cook it, 
it'll turn out like a piece of rubber, but if you 
know how to fix it, 
it's really good. 
MHz I've heard people say that if you want to make it stick 
together you have to add fat from domestic animals 
it? 
3 
i 
i 
DH  That's what I do, I put pork with it -- like if .'I make 
ground meat or sausage, I've mixed pork in it 
MH: You make deer sausage? 
DHs Sure -- and like if you're gonna barbecue or something, 
you can put bacon on it, you know, 
like if you take the loins you 
can split the loins and put a couple strips of bacon inside and 
wrap bacon around it, 
so that when you're cooking it it won't dry 
out -- cause if you just cook it by itself it'll just dry away 
to nothin. 
It doesn't have any fat in it. 
When I= make hamburgers -- make ground meat, I call em bambi 
burgers ( laughs) -- bambi burgers. 
I'll tell you one thing it's 
better than hamburgers 
MH: Probably better for you too -- so who taught you to 
trap? Did you go out with anyone ? 
DH: Yeah, I've seen a few people trap, but I kinda just more 
or less learned by myself, and then talkin to different people --
older people -- like this old man we'll go see -- he's a good 
otter catcher -- I had to go ask him -- I had a lot of trouble 
catchin otters, and there's really a trick to it 
MH: What do you have to do? 
DH: You gotta water set your traps usually, and they're 
a pretty smart animal -- they're hard to catch 
MH: Well they're so playful 
DH: They play with me sometime when I'm out there -- they 
swim around the boat or the pirogue or something. Y'all see any 
wildlife yesterday? 
MH: Not really -- just saw a few nutria yesterday -- I saw a 
DH: A bullfrog? 
MH: No, 
it was a little teeny 
DH: Leopardfrog? 
MH: It was really little 
DH: Tree frog? A little green one? Or a dark one? 
MH: A little dark one, and he popped his head right outa the 
water 
-- and then also birds, but nothing else 
DH: Well 
MH: And a dead alligator 
DH: We see a lot of those 
MH: You have alligator fish too? 
DH: I've hunted alligators, used to get tags and all -- same 
thing, you set lines to catch em, or you shoot em -- you see an 
opportunity to shoot im, 
you shoot im, 
or you just pull with a 
hook to get it up afterward -- a long pole if it's in water 
fairly deep. The best way is to set lines. You go at night and 
spot where they are at night, you know, which is legal, and 
MH: Are they out at night? 
DH: Oh yeah, they come out -- with the headlights you can 
see the eye -- it's just like a flashlight shining back at you. 
You go at night and spot em, and you set your lines for em -- your 
bait the lines and set em above the water, not in the water ---
you put a bird on it or a chicken neck -- quarter- inch nylon 
rope's what it is, 
and you gotta use a steel leader so they don't 
chew it up, and then you could ,lust hang it above the water -
shove a pole at an angle in the bank -- the line's gonna hang 
over the water with a slip knot, and then you give him enough 
frog 
i 
slack so that when he gets the ba it he s li ps th e li ne loose', he 
can go, and he'll come up by the bank and he'll swallow it, . hook 
and all 
MHz Does it have a name like trout line? 
DH: A•'trout line is what you use for catching fish with 
MH; So this would be an alligator line? 
DH: Umhm 
MHz Do you use different kinds of boats to do this? 
DH: Well, people use pirogues here , you know, and they also 
use mud boats -- a small skiff with a air-cooled engine in it, 
because you can't use an outboard because the water's too 
shallow, and the outboard sucks the trash into the water pump, so 
they use what's called a mud boat -- an inboard thing that you 
make, in fact we got one in the shed, and we're fixin to build 
another one 
MHz You've built boats 
DH: Oh yeah , I've built quite a few boats 
MHz Is boatbuilding the kind of thing that ,
lust everybody 
does , or are a few people specialists? 
DH: Well, boats are not that hard to build, but to build a 
good one you should be pretty skilled. They got people that's 
really good at it -- like before when they made pirogues, 
dugouts, you took a log, cypress log, split it, dug the inside 
outt and smoothed it, you gotta have a little skill to make it 
come out nice -- a lotta people build pirogues out of plywood 
now, or fiberglass.  I prefer fiberglass 
MHz What makes it a pirogue is the shape? 
DH: Yeah, dugout, you know -- they got dugouts, or what 
they'd call a pirogue, 
like with plywood, flat bottom, and we, 
I'll show you a pirogue 
MHz When you go out looking for alligators at night, are 
they ever aggressive? 
DH: Not unless you corner em. You get a mouse in the corner, 
he's got one way out and that's through you, that's what he'll do 
MHz Can you call them? 
DH: Umhm. You can grunt and splash the water a little bit, 
and they'll come, specially when they got little ones , they got 
nests and all, they'll come 
MHz I'd want to excersise that skill carefully 
DH: No, they 're  not bad, they're  really not -- you know, 
MHz Are they smart? 
DH: No , they're not very smart. 
It doesn't take a lot of 
skill to kill an alligator. Just find him. 
It doesn 't take a lot 
to kill one . I used to go in the marshes, which is against th e 
law now, I used to go in the marshes and go in the holes -- they 
make ponds and (?), You 'd go in the hole with a long pole and 
shove the pole around -- stand in the hole , shove the pole from 
between your legs up into .
there, and hit him and get him to come 
out, and when he'd come out he'd hit your legs in the water --
well he doesn't ever, 
know what you are, he just runs into 
something so then he surfaces and you kill him with a hatchet, 
understand? 
MHz Okay 
DH: So, that sounds dangerous too, but you gotta realize 
that this thing doesn 't even realize what he's bumpin into --
7 
not comin out to attack you, he's just 
cause you're prob i 
n him,  you know? 
MH: I know snapping turtles can bite a 
is it the same with alligators? 
DH: Yeah, they'll snap shut on you ten 
of Side One) 
SIDE TWO of AMH011 
MHz Do you think that the park could manage the marsh so 
that people could see how trapping is done? 
DHz For interpretive purposes? No, 
see, for instance, they 
got, 
like Kenta Canal, that's the canoe trail, 
local people call 
it the Priest Canal, you're not allowed to trap on it, because of 
people canoin, a lot of people don't 
MHz It upsets them 
DH: Right, 
it upsets them. So, you're not allowed to trap on 
it, which is a real good trapping area, along the water there, so 
I doubt seriously because of the way people feel that it would be 
a good thing to take people out there and let em actually see 
somebody trapping -- you'd have the Audubon Society 
MHz What about just letting trappers manage an area the way 
they would do it traditionally? 
DH: Uh - that would cause other problems ( laughs) 
That 
would cause other problems. They'd be cuttin the vegetation, 
burnin it, diggin it, and 
MHz Would it hurt the marsh? 
DH: No, not to any great extent -- you know, people trapped 
and managed trapping areas, you know, did what they had to do to 
keep the habitat right to trap muskrat or whatever, for as long 
as man's been trappin, and settled in one place, but people don't 
always necessarily do what's the best thing for the marsh -- and 
some people do it out of ignorance, or some people just don't 
care -- they'll just take a piece of land, rape it, and get what 
they can off it and move on and forget about it, 
so you gotta 
have some guidelines, some kind of rules. Now if a man owns a 
piece of land or has a lease or whatever, with no restrictions, 
then he can do what he wants, 
it's up to him whether he wants to 
maintain that and keep a population that's worth trapping. Well I 
know people that have trapped every last animal -- they'll take 
all that they can get, and then they go back and trap the next 
year and they don't catch nothin and they're cryin cause they 
have a bad year -- and you tell em " Hey, 
it's cause you take 
everything and you don't leave nothin, you can't do that. When 
you see animals are gettin scarce, you should move to a different 
area or your lease and leave somethin there for next year. 
They'll repopulate. But if you get in there and just strip it, 
it 
can take three or four years for it to really be productive 
again, where if you just take the best, or the males and leave 
the females, where you see you're catchin little animals, turn em 
loose, you take the difference between say, 
like a number one 
nutria three or four years ago you'd get 12, 
1,4, dol lars for a 
number one, which is a big female or male and the hide's not 
damaged. And then you'd go down to a smaller size and it becomes 
a number two or even
-trash, which would be number three and you 
look and it's two or three dollars, so some people are just 
greedy enough or ignorant enough they'll say, " Well, that's three 
do 11 ars, 
I" rn not gonna t 
urn i 
t 1 
oose. " 
Some of ern j 
ust k 
i 
nda 
look at it as money. " Well I caught three of these today, that's 
nine dollars or ten dollars." And they don't really realize that 
had they turned that animal loose it coulda been the seed for the 
following year. 
MHz So even fifty years ago you had these different 
approaches and mentalities? 
DH: Sure, look around you. Look around you in here! Anything 
you do it's the same thing. Some people's got it together and 
some don't. That's all there,,js to it. Just cause the guys 
trapping doesn't mean he's ignorant or stupid and can't do nothin 
else for a living. But by the same token, Just cause he's trappin 
doesn't make him intelligent either. 
If he knows what he's doin, 
he understands what he's workin with and he uses that to benefit, 
then it'll benefit him. But if he just doesn't care, and you got 
some of the most intelligent people could care less about 
anything, you know, then he's gonna hurt himself in the long run. 
Some people -- same thing with bull-eyeing (?) deer at night, or 
killin deer, when you go and you kill does and bull-eye at night, 
if you like to hunt you're not hurting anybody but yourself and 
everybody else that likes to hunt, because in a few years 
there'll be nothin left for you to hunt, where if you just take 
bucks or whatever's legal, or whatever -- then you always have 
deer, it's guaranteed. But some people don't think that way. 
It's the same thing when they dig canals through wetlands 
-- oil companies— they want the oil. They wanna get in there 
and drill for the oil, that's all they care about. They don't 
care about the environment, and it's money. It's economics. 
They're pressured because they have to produce -- and these 
people don't care. The other guy that's trapping in that marsh, 
or somebody who's interested in wildlife or habitat, they get up 
in arms about it -- it's the same thing they had in the 
Everglades I think last year they had floodwaters and the 
wildlife and fisheries over there wanted to let hunters go in and 
take the deer, because the deer was gonna starve and they were 
drownin, and I think it was Audubon Society or protectors of 
wildlife, got up in arms about it. 
They had people come in -- I 
watched the film clip -- and people comin in on air boats they 
had big deer they were holdin up with one hand. They'd starved to 
death. Now why didn't they let them harvest these deer before 
they starved. 
If they'd gone in and killed most of the deer the 
ones that they left that wasn't hunted would've had enough food 
and stayed healthy and built the population back up. . 
They're dead set against hunting under any circumstances. 
MH: They're trying to ban trapping up in Canada 
DH: There's gonna always be trapping here -- what are you 
gonna do with nutrias - no control, unless they get the alligator 
population back up -- which, they're increasing 
I 
All over the whole country's like that -- with wolves, 
coyotes, mountain lions, whatever -- You go in,,-areas even in the 
west or northwest -- they have problems with deer herds there 
because they don't have any natural predators, the coyote's been 
killed, the wolf's been killed, the bear's been killed -- so the 
deer just go wild, and then you got 2'00 deer surrounding one 
little bush they're gonna all starve 
MH: So who's the guy we're gonna go talk to 
DH: Ursin (?) Coppel, he's an old man. He came to Crown 
Point -- he paddled to Crown Point -- literally brought his 
family there in a pirogue -- we'll go talk to him and a couple 
other people

MH: Did you really make a movie with Clint Eastwood? 
UC: Yeah -- " River Rat" 
MH: What's your name? 
UC: Ursin Coppel -
MH: So how did you wind up in the movie with Clint Eastwood? 
UC: I'll tell you what happened. I was in church, and they 
come down there asking for somebody could speak French. So I started 
joking, me and another fellow there, I said " Well, I can't speak 
French" 
But I was twenty years old before I learned anything 
else than French -- my grandparents come from Bordeaux, France, 
on my daddy's side, and on my mother's side, they come from 
Belgium --the French part. So we grew up and spoke French 
see? 
And that's why them people asked -- " We look for somebody who can 
speak French," so I told this other guy, " Mas de papa le 
Francais," -- so we went there and we were supposed to play the 
movie and speak French, and then somebody say " It don't make no 
difference, we'll put the word after )" 
So we went there, that's 
how we got into that play, me and another guy from -- his family 
come from Bayou LaFourche like me -- and in bayou LaFourche the 
majority of the people in the town spoke French, 
it's like in the 
west like Lafayette and places like that where the French people 
settled. 
I was born and raised in Bayou LaFourche -- Golden Meadow is 
one part -- that's one area -- but B_aycu-4z-aFour_che•is the longaat  
pt reet in the world 
 
it starts from the Gulf of Mexico west of 
Grand Island and goes all the way to Napoleonville up there to 
the river --
MH: How many miles is that? 
DH: It's a hundred something miles 
UC: Like I said, it's the longest street in the world -
that highway, what do you call it LA 1 -- it went all the way to 
Grand Island and I don't know how far north west you go, when you 
cross Baton Rouge you cross LA 1 before you get to Alexandria, 
and LA I's still going 
MH: How did your family come to be in this area? 
UC: They come here on ship -- it took my great grandpa a 
year to come across the ocean from France over here -- there was 
work I guess, most of the people probably got on the ship workin, 
coming over ( hard to understand here) 
MH: What year was that? 
UC: Really I don't know the year 
MH: About when? 
UC: My grandpa was here in the early eighteens -- my great 
grandpa must have come here in the late seventeen hundreds -
what I remember I know I heard about the age and all, see. My 
daddy was born 1870,'so, my grandpa was raised over.here. 
MH: They settled in Bayou LaFourche? 
UC: That's where my grandpa was raised, in Bayou 
LaFourche -- the way I know, they used to have a little 
plantation on GOIden Meadow -- that was my grandpa had that when 
my daddy was small 
MH: So what was his business? 
UC: They had a sugar plantation -- really, 
it should be 
still ours, cause they never sold it. I don't know, somehow or 
another they just lost on a little grocery -- it was a piece of 
property that was a lot of money -- for about four hundred 
dollars, I believe -- people took it and they never did settle 
back on ( unclear) 
MHz Is that part of Barataria? 
UC: When you leave from here on the west 
DH: Bayou LaFourche was the river at one time, the 
Mississippi before it changed back and forth -- and that area 
there has a natural high ridge just like the Barataria lobe (?) 
-- just another lobe of the river -- so people settled in there 
too and it was all farmland -- you go look at bayou LaFourche 
today it's probably no wider than the shore --
(I turn down the radio, and a visitor comes in) 
(Ursin greets her in French) 
UC: See, 
in other words, Bayou LaFourche was a branch off 
the Mississippi River -- it's much of a higher land than over 
here really, because that's why they had people like us got there 
and lived there, because it was still the river -- that's what 
made the -- Bayou LaFourche went so far the same as the 
Mississippi River -- they built on each side of the bayou (?) --
and over here there was just a small branch off the river, Bayou 
Barataria 
MHz When were you born? 
UC: In 1908 
MH: How did you end up over here? 
UC: I move here in 1937 -- I was 17 years old -- and when I 
got married, I moved here after I got married -- I was `8 and a 
half when I got married 
MHz Your father raised sugar cane? 
UC: That's what my parents used to do 
what I did, I 
started to trap when I was small -- and I hunted --
I was about 
seven years old. I was not in a school or nothin like that, so 
instead of going to school I went to work -- I had ten hours 
school in my whole life, after I was forty three years old 
DH: Tell her how you got here and everything ( laughs) 
UC: I'll tell you what, I still tried to learn to read and 
write, when I was a kid. I was at home which was nowhere near 
school -- I had two sisters older than me. And I used to take a 
calendar -- it was half French, half English -- they call that, 
the French call that a calendar -- you got six months on one 
side, six months on the other side. Well, when I had a little 
chance to look at it, 
I look at that and I see the parts from 
number one on down, I look on the back and I see the letter -
for like Monday it was L -- the first letter for Monday was L --• 
DH: He'd look at the r-' 
of the calendar, and then 
he'd turn it over anti look at the English side 
UC: and then Tuesday was D -- now I forgot exactly -- there 
was two and three letters to abbreviate the word -- so I look at 
that and then when my daddy come home I ask, I say, " What that 
mean?" So he tell me, because 
my daddy had went to the third 
grade of school, on Golden Meadow, and me I was a little ridge 
away from there, so okay, I study it like that, and-
then after 
that I study about the weather, the moon, the sun, and everything 
like that, by myself at home -- learned what I could, I didn't 
have no school, there was no school around, so I wanted to learn 
some -- I learned the best I could. I learned to read a little 
and write a little, then when I was 15 years old I started to put 
up a little grocery -- I went in the grocery business for a 
while. I didn't have any money -- I tried it out; see I hear 
about all the other people here from'Europe and all that, and go 
in business, so I said I want to try it. 
So I tried it, and it 
was alright . They didn 't have that many people , though, so I 
really couldn 't make a living out of that 
MH: Where was the grocery store 
UC: It was on a ridge southwest of Golden Meadow, so it was 
really, on the place I was we was only two families -- a little 
away from there, about a mile and a half, two mile on each side 
me they had a few other people, but not many. So when I was about 
ten years old I started to get some money, I was going to build 
me a boat, with nobody that was (?) ( carpentering?) around me, so 
I tell my daddy and tell my brother that when I was big enough I 
could save enough money I'd build me a boat. So they used to 
laugh at me , and when I got to be sixteen years old , I build my 
boat. 
MH: Why would they laugh? 
UC: Because how I'm gonna build a boat, I didn't have nobody. 
to show me how 
MH: Nobody showed you how? What kind of boat was it? 
UC: Oh, a little , what they consider a lugger, which was 
flat -bottom , 22 and a half foot long and six foot eight inches 
wide -- now in the first place they told me it was too wide 
because all the boats used to be built narrow before and 
MH: Why did you do that? 
UC: Because I had an idea that would be the right way 
DH: And he was right , because it should be about one-third 
of the length 
UC: It was in my mind to do it that way and I figure it was 
right -- I used to argue with a man who was much older than me 
that I build a boat same size as he if he had a little boat, and 
with the same (?) which I did and that's what happened -- a 
little boat he had, well he had a -- a the time it was -- they 
called it horsepower -- now it is rabbit power -- it was a big 
motor but it was one and a half horsepower , and me I had two and 
a half, which was a half a horsepower more, and his little boat 
was seventeen and a half-foot long, mine was 22 and a half, and 
his was five and a half, mine was six foot eight inches 
MH: What kind of a motor did you have? 
UC: They called it (?) at the time -- they used it mostly on 
winches I believe and things like that -- or like they use on (?) 
wheel -- in that type -- big flywheel, one center motor -- and I 
built the boat like I told him -- I was a kid at the time so he 
told me, "You got a nice little boat ," but he said,."It won't 
run" and we tried the two boat together -- and he had a hard time 
beatin me -- the lugger was built by a regular carpenter, that 
somebody that knew all about it, which me, I didn 't know, I was•a 
kid. 
MH: Was it made of cypress? 
UC: Yes ma'am 
MH: What did you use it for? 
UC: I used it for trawlin , trappin and things like that.

I 
When I got married I was makin a living with that little boat. 
that time I worked the shipyard, you see, I kept on doin' 
carpenter work -- before I got married, at first I ( 7) f 
thought 
of workin the swamp, as'a lumber jacket -- cut trees, 
light 
poles, firewood --
MHz Who did you work for? 
UC: For Mr. Joe ( Audumon, Ottomon?) from Cutoff -- he's 
still in Bayou LaFourche -- we cut trees for the sawmill, he had 
a little sawmill also, and he'd order from the Light
-from 
Lockport to Golden Meadow, most of the piling, and I used to haul 
wood to the platform over here -- where they used to lay the 
shrimp to dry in the sun, so we cut wood for that, people want 
wood for a factory in bayou Lafourche, firewood for the house and 
all that 
MHz What shipyard did you work for? 
UCz Oh, 
I work over here for, 
it was one of my cousin, Tony 
Coppel used to have a little shipyard right here just about a 
half a,mile from here, up the road here, Charlie Gilead (?) 
MHz What did you do in the different seasons? 
UC: Trawl, fish, we used to fish speckled trout (?) and we 
used to fish on Lake Timberly (?) Timberly Bay on the other side ofi 
Golden Meadow, from Lafourche Parish -- mostly in Terrebonne 
MHz Is that still called that? 
DH: Umhm -- Timberly Bay 
UC: We used to fish trout with a (?) -- anything a poor man 
could do for a living -- live off the land, why, that's what you 
gotta do 
MHz What would you do in the winter season? 
UC: Trap 
MHz where would you do most of your trapping? 
UC: We used to trap right there where I was raised in 
LaFourche Parish, and we used to catch muskrats, few mink, few 
coon, thing like that -- they didn't have the nutria like we have 
today. We didn't know anything about that -- mostly all we 
trapped was for muskrat 
MH: Did you own the marsh you trapped on? 
UC: No, we used to trap, 
in other word, 
like on the state 
land 
MHz Did you have to lease it? 
UC: No, we didn't have to lease it -- only thing was buy a 
license, a state license. That's the only thing we had to pay for 
-- til I got, they started leasing the land after th a t w hen I was * 
about fifteen years old -- they start tryin to lease the land. 
But they didn't get -- They bad places still where they be long to 
the state -- like they uses 
O" call -- this is' called the 
Delaware <?) property at the'time -- a man named Brady, he 
started that lease -. and that same land, now they Call it 
Louisiana Land

c 
DH: That's the man that paddled over here 
UC: Where we were living, see, 
in that farmhouse on the road 
on Bayou Lafourche, five mile on the other side of Bayou 
Lafourche -- where a big Catholic Church is right on the side of 
the Bayou -- we come from the back of Cutoff and come to a canal 
and it was five mile to get to the Church ( Larne?) then ,lust 
about a block from there -- first I run through that inter-coastal 
canal -- that's over here -- was in a pirogue from that town. I 
left my house at one o'clock after midnight and I got here where 
the Louisiana (?) Power and Light got a plant across there -- I 
come there 25 minutes of 11 that day. 
I come here to look for a 
,lob. 
I come with a set of tools, what I figure to make a week's 
wage, and I come here by my cousin, Tony Coppel, used to live 
right there on the other side of (?) -- and -- it was Monday 
morning or something. So that Monday (?) and the next morning I 
went over there and I talked to the old man, and he asked me 
"What do you do over here?" and I said " Well 
I come to see about 
a job." But everybody tell me you couldn't buy a job. So he said, 
"What you know about carpentry?" So I told him. 
I said " You know 
I built my first boat myself," and he says " I think I can (?)" so 
,he asked me about the inside/outside of a plank, you see? So I 
told him. He said, " You know more than the old man. Well come 
here with me, you kngw that much -- (?)" 
MH: What's the difference between the inside and outside of 
a plank? 
UC: Inside? Well, the tree grow around, eh? So you see where 
the grain go all around the t-ge, you see? Wsll i:h,=t goes around 
1 uorne in, 
like  you saw a plank,  this  side  
you gonna see 
the ridge comin up on each side, 
like it's comin out back on it 
(?) and that's the inside. The outside you see it goes in instead 
on each side, and that's how I knew what was the inside and

-.W 
outside 
DH: They do that because the plank'll warp, it's gonna turn 
in -- it turns to the inside, so you gotta know that when you'i^e 
buildin something 
MH: So when you're building a boat you'd want the inside to 
be on the inside? 
UC: Inside. 
If you don't it'll hook, I think mostly, 
if you 
rub on something it will hook -- it'll try to warp thataway, see? 
So, I had experience in wood, you see, I used to be a lumber 
jacket, that we cut trees for the sawmill and all that stuff, 
too, you_see, 
so I knew about the inside of a plank and the 
outside -- so he said, " Well, you know more than (?) did when he 
come here, which he was old" That and I built my boat, I built it 
the right way too, the inside of the plank inside. 
You have to figure the way a tree is made -- the tree is 
round, and when you cut you gotta know what's the inside and 
what's the outside, so, because if you don't, 
like I say, 
if they 
put it inside out, when you bend it will start to break loose. 
MH: But the inside is determined by the way the tree grows, 
not by the way you cut it? 
UC: The grain -- when you saw lumber you could also saw 
cross- grain, 
like for flooring or something like that, a lotta 
people would rather use " edge grain" they call it, see? That the 
grain is not, 
instead of being flat like that, 
it'd be edgeway --
So they have a different way of -- but like I say, a good logger 
needs a good head to learn a thing, that's all (?) Otherwise I 
don't guess I'd know how to sign my name 
MH: What tools did you bring? 
UC: When I come to get a job at the shipyard? Well, 
like I 
say, the people tell me, when I got here, everybody I talked to, 
they tell me " You can't buy a job" you know, I mean, no work. 
There's a lotta people doin nothin, and when I wanted to talk to 
the man, which was my cousin, he was 25 years older than me, he 
had been doin that kinda work most of his life, so he asked me, 
he said, " You got any tools?" After I told him what I done, I 
said, " Yeah." 
He said, " Well be here tomorrow morning at seven 
o'clock." And that's how I got my job. Everybody was te11in me 
you couldn't buy a job, and me I come there on Tuesday and 
Wednesday morning he tell me to be there at 7 o'clock to go to 
work. 
MH: But what were the tools? A saw? A hammer? 
UC: Oh, you have to have saw, plane and hammer and hatchet 
-- carpenter tools, you see. 
DH: If you ever watch them build a boat, they can do good 
work with just a hatchet and piecin the planks together 
UC: I used to -- I'll tell you, I did a lat of, 
like a bow 
stem, the only thing ._I could use at the ti me to 
make a bow stem was a hatchet. So I used to do a lot, we used to 
do a lot of little boats, and I made most of the bow stem. So the 
old man told me when I come down after he saw me work, he say, 
well, he was kinda particular, he took me on because I had 
patience to do my work right -- not fast, but I do it right. So 
after that, well I work in a different place, during the war I 
worked for the navy digging, in the city park in New Orleans, 
three years, and then I got outa the 
city park plant, and a 
1 
2 
LFPAMHO12 
lotta other people came to a different place because they 
couldn't do something the way they want, so me, when I went 
there, they asked what I know about boats I said " Well I know a 
little about most everything about building a boat," and the park 
they say, " Well if you get in trouble, this many could help you. 
He's been here for three or four years, so when I started to 
work, well, people that worked, I watched them do their work, and 
they were in trouble sometime, and they couldn't get ahead of 
their work, and me, 
I got mine done. So they said " Mr. Coppel, 
you ought to be ashamed to let the foreman tell you that to see 
us 
if you in trouble, to ask us, when you could teach him." I 
said, " No, 
I'm not ashamed of that. 
I'd rather let him know that 
I know more than I tell him I know. I feel better. So when I had 
to change somethin the foreman gave me to do it, 
I go ahead and 
changed it, 
I didn't go ask him, I just go ahead and change it. 
So he come to ask, " Who changed this plan?" Someone say, " Not 
me." I said, " I did it." He said, " Why?" I said -- " Okay," he 
says, " Go ahead and do it." Then he come and ask me " What I did 
wrong?" So I tell him. 
(His son): Didn't you build your own boats bigger after you 
got here? 
UC: Oh yeah 
DH: He also built his house, the house that's down the road 
here. And how many acres of land you bought? 
UC: More or less three acres -- 11 acres deep, 55 foot 
front. 
DH: When he built his house, he coulda bought more land but 
he was scared he wouldn't be able to pay for it, 
because, you 
know, money was hard -- he paid for it, 
what, one year trapping, 
huh? 
UC: ( agrees) 
DH: One year he had a good year -- bought -- paid for the 
land and the house 
MH: Is your land measured in arpents? 
UC: Over here, when we came here they used to sell you a 
piece of land, on about, a little area, nine acres or so, 
but you 
go further up the road, 
it runs 11 acres deep, so what I bought, 
I ask him, (?) and he give me 11 acres of land, 
but I was not 
makin that much money -- two dollars a day. So I'd go trappin in 
the winter, well, 
like I say, 
if the winter's good, it's alright, 
but I didn't know -- It looked like it was pretty bad then -- but 
when I come back, somebody bought next to me, so I had to jump to 
buy more land, so I say, well, 
I'll just stay where I am 
MH: What did you have on your land? Woods and fields? 
UC: Yeah, when you buy a piece of land, you got,.like you 
see, this land here, you see all them trees and all that stuff? 
That's a 
1 
1 yours. 
MH: Did you trap on your own land? 
UC: No, not over here, there was no marsh hardly. No. 
MH: You didn't trap in the woods at all? 
UC: I trapped a little in the woods, but not that much. I 
couldn't much count on that. 
MH: What would you trap in the woods? 
UC: Coon, minks,- that's all they had 
MH: Didn't they have foxes? 
3 
LFPAMHO12 . 
UC: No -- we had an otter, we had nine in the marsh at one-
time, they didn't have hardly any. 
I remember when my daddy was 
trappin, I was a kid, 
I remember him catch about two otter at a 
time, I remember which year -- I was twenty two years old when my 
daddy died, and my daddy died 193@, and I was twenty two years 
old on the third of October. So I had to take care of my mother 
and the rest of my brothers and sisters -- they was younger than 
me. 
MH: You had brothers? 
UC: There was three brothers that grew up, 
but I had, all my 
brothers younger than me, even, we had one that died a little 
baby, he was still younger than me, he was right after me. But I 
had five sisters, and two older than me, and three younger than 
me, and two brothers. That's my young brother right in that 
picture there. He died in WWII. 
MH: In combat? 
UC: No, he drowned right over here, right in front of my 
place where I was over there. He was workin on a dredge that 
works in the Intercoastal, and he didn't drown at work here, he 
come home and he never did learn how to swim. 
MH: Do you know how to swim? 
UC: Yeah, I know how to swim. 
I'll tell you what. I fell off 
my boat out there, the year I got married, I fell off my boat 
about two and a half, three miles from the shore in the Gulf, and 
stayed in there -- there was nobody close, so I couldn't holler 
-- so I asked the good Lord to help me that I make it ashore, and 
somebody come and pick me up and put me back in my boat. 
MH: How did they see you out there? 
UC: The man said he saw something in the water, 
it didn't 
look natural like a bird or anything like that to him, so (?) he 
started to come towards me, 
and I knew the guy, and when he 
started to come towards me I just lay on my back. 
MH: What's the most difficult animal to trap 
UC: Well, I didn't find any difficult to trap, but the most 
difficult is the otter, and it was not for me. 
I'd catch otter 
any time, any place where he had been. 
MH: Well, what's the trick to it? 
UC: I see if he got business where nothin else is going to 
come there before -- I catch him on the highway -- (?) on a hill, 
like on a levee or anything, I dig in the dust, I cover my trap 
with the dust, and then make the road like it was never disturbed 
or nothin and it come right there and get caught. 
MH: Is there a name for the set you use? 
UC: It's just like a set. 
It's just an experience, an 
understanding of what you gotta do, 
because like I know some 
people trapped close to me, they could never catch -- maybe one 
or two in the winter: I caught as high as 36 in one winter. They 
used to call me the champion, for trappin otter. 
DH: Good money some years too, seventy or eighty dollars 
MH: A hide? 
DH: Umhm. Big animals too 
UC: Yeah. 
It's a pretty thing. I have pictures. Some days I 
catch as high as four 
MH: And some people couldn't catch two in the whole season 
UC: They used to call me the otter champion, trapper.

LFPAMHO12 
MHz Do they have skinning contests around here? 
DH: They got places where they skin em, they could- get in 
contests too if you want to -- they got people cleanin 300 -- 400 
nutrias a day. 
I'll take you down here and show you. 
MH: What about the wringer I've seen in models? 
UC: Right, I used that to clean mushrat, and they clean 
nutria with that a little, but they don't clean it like they do 
here, they get a board, 
like a little piece of log, and they put 
a net on that, and they let em soak in the water, and then they 
scrape with a draw- knife, like a thing with two handles, a handle 
on each side -- they're 
made like what they call a drawknife, 
and they scrape with that. 
DH: I'll take you to 8isante's after this 
UC: Yeah, you see, 
it's just like you do anything, you try 
to learn it right, you gotta get in your mind what you gotta do 
to do it right. Now I'd run high as, really, my line of traps for 
mushrats, about 800 traps. I run it every day. 
MH: Now? 
UC: Not no more because they don't have no place to trap, 
nobody don't have that kinda land, but I used to do it. 
MH: How would you do it? 
UC: You make a line. I used to take and I start like this. I 
go around the way, 
if I was walkin, 
I'd walk as far as my land 
would go one way, 
I'd cross the land and I'd come back another 
way -- I'd go around and make a big circle, and then, as the 
winter go by, you comin in all the time. So you got mostly the 
whole block of the animal, not many gonna get out -- some get 
out, enough that your land won't be (?) but it's easier to catch 
em. Now if you go all over in there, then you gonna just run them 
outa the land. 
I've seen old men do that -- just trap all over on 
the land, and they wouldn't catch half as much as what I'd catch. 
MH: So this would be like a big bull's eye? 
DH: A big circle, you'd close it 
in. 
center -- you could get Out 
MH: And you would wind up in the 
-- how far apart was each trap? 
UC: It depend on how much animal they got -- you see, 
sometime they gotta go a good ways, you know 
DH: See, what he's talkin about, you make a circle -- but 
the thing is, 
if you got a area you got animals in, then that's 
where you set the traps, then you may come to an area where 
there's no animals -- but the habitat, the place is not quite 
right, so you wanna pass over that. And then you hit another area 
where the habitat's right and you got animals, you know, so it's 
a circle, but there's not continuous traps in^the circle 
MH: So the habitats would really be patchy 
DH: Right, that's what it is 
MH: What would the right habitat be? 
DH: A lot of grass, three-cornered grass, stuff like that 
UC: Three- cornered grass is the best stuff for muskrats. And 
you see, 
if you walk all over VOIAr land, and when you start, 
animals can't stay quiet, so they gotta move, but if you do the 
,right thing, see, 
like I said, you make a circle, don't disturb 
all of the place (?), well you can trap and trap all winter 
MH: Did you burn your marshes? 
UC: Well, 
if you don't, 
it'll rot out. 
It's against the law 
s 
LFPAMHO12 
to do, burn marsh, but the normal at the end of 
winter-- that's 
when you burn the land so the grass will grow back -- because 
otherwise they eat the grass and knock em down and they stay 
there and they 
-w 
DH: The grass wouldn't come back because you got so much 
dead vegetation on top -- after you burn it, 
it comes right back, 
it grows back real fast. Now the reason they started this, the 
trappers originally started this because a long time ago they 
used to burn marshes to find alligator holes, but they found out 
by doin that -- see they burned it off to find the holes in the 
ponds, and they found out that by burnin it, the grass and all 
would come back and it made a better habitat, and they'd start 
burning their land every year after they finished trappin -- and 
the animals could simply go under water to escape the fire, 
because it burns fast -- it's a flash fire 
MH: If you don't burn it, 
what happens? 
DH: Then eventually the grass keeps pilin up and pilin up 
and you have less new growth, a lot of dead grass, plus, Sea- ray 
-- they call it wax myrtle -- will take over marshes and fresh 
water areas and even brackish water areas and it changes back 
into a woodline or a scrub brush, so it's no longer a marsh 
UC: That's right 
DH: Which, a long time ago, nature did that with lightning 
or whatever, but you could take a marsh area that's startin to 
get a lot of wax myrtle like we have in the park and all, 
it's 
spreadin now because it hasn't been burned in so long. Eventually 
it won't be a marsh. 
It'll wind up bein all wax myrtle, so you 
lose a lot of the marsh to that and it's not the habitat for 
muskrats cause the three-cornered grass is not gonna grow there. 
MH: You call that sea-ray? 
DH: It's called sea-ray bush, wax myrtle 
MH: Is that a French word or an English word? 
UC: Sea- ray, really, I think it's M 
between the French and 
the English, really. 
MH: What does it mean? 
UC: It's something that was common on the land -- it grew 
when the grass died -- the animals dig the roots, and it fall 
down and it kill the grass, and then they got that stuff come 
over. And that's why they got a lot of ponds today, that they 
used to not have before. I trap a piece of land, I been trappin 
the last twenty years I guess, but I had started in 1939, and 
when I was trappin the land I had it in good order, but I always 
took care of the animals, I never let it get too thick, or nothin 
like that, and after I left there I went to work in the shipyard 
during WWII. The people that had the land after they didn't trap 
enough, the animals 'got so thick in there they kill most of the 
grass. Now it's nothin but mostly pond in the same land, that I 
could walk from a bay, 
what we call bay run, that was 
approximately 900 acres of land, and I could walk from one end to 
the other -- now you can't go nowhere hardly in the middle of the 
land because it's all pond. When I was there -- when I went back 
about twenty years ago, the land looked- like it was ruined. You 
could see the animals, like the muskrats as far as the eye could 
see, you could see ' em rennin there, because there was no more 
grass, the grass was dyin out. No more grass.

DH: They have what they call " eat-outs" -- they go in 
cycles. They get so many they have a eat out. They eat all the 
vegetation, 
it turns into like a mud flat, then all the animals-
die, and the cycle starts all over again. So you got lean years 
until they build up again. But if you trap em continuously and 
you don't take ern all, 
but you take a lot out, that situation 
doesn't occur. They don't overpopulate. You get some every year, 
rather than having a peak year and then nothin for the next two 
or three years. 
UC: See, that land, I build that land back up again. But 
there the last couple of years I don't know what happened, 
it 
look like -- I don't know if it come from the storm or the water y 
or they got so many oil companies ruin -- that oil hurts the land 
a lot too, kill the grass and a lot of the animals too, because 
the animals start to die, even though there wasn't much, but the 
land died -- there's hardly any grass growin there no more. But I 
had built that land up good after I went back there. I went there 
the first year I went back, I was catching a hundred rats a day, 
I mean nutria, a hundred, a hundred five nutrias a day, and I 
start trap for mushrat later in the season, and I carne a hundred, 
a hundred some rats a day, see? 
MH: So, you can't get that many 
UC: Not now, no more, no. 
If I was, 
if I had the land, I 
could earn (?) pretty good -- not too many years ago when we got 
rats came back again I was catch my 80 - 100 rats a day, about 
five years ago. 
DH: Even when I trap, when I trap in the park today, when I 
was trappin in there, 
if I catch fifteen or twenty a day, the 
price was good enough then, we got twelve,
- fourteen dollars 
apiece -- so some days I'd catch two or three hundred dollars of 
nutria -- you had a bad year that year, right? 
UC: ( agrees) 
DH: He had a bad year -- he was comin in with five and six, 
and I was catchin like 20 a day, so, you know, 
it just depends on 
where you're at and what's gain on, and then the money was good 
that year. Now it don't pay you -- this is about four years ago 
-- because the last three years they been gettin five dollars for 
em, see? So you gotta catch more to make money. 
If you catch 20 
rats at five dollars apiece, 20 nutrias, that's a hundred 
dollars. But sometimes you can't catch that many. You don't have 
the animals and the money's not there, you can't make any money. 
If they're worth a lot of money, 
if you're gettin 12 dollars, 
14 
dollars, then you can make 
(Ursin's son-in-law comes in) 
DH: Hey! This is Ross, this is Mary. ( general greetings and 
explanations) 
UC: Like I say, one time I hit my head about ten years ago, 
coming under'a bridge in my little boat, and things don't come to 
ray mind as fast as they used to -- so, the sun the way it hit me, 
I said, " Well it don't pay you to k:11 yourself any more, so just 
lay down and die." His wife and kid was bringin my grocery over 
by (?), so when I lay down like that on ray right side, I look at 
my motor, I got a 135 
(end of side one)

LFPAMH01`2 
SIDE TWO of AMHO12 
UC: My daughter and her two little girl, lookin at me, so I 
said, " I can't give up now." And my wife was gone to the camp, 
the-same time with another family, and she ,lust had come out of 
open heart surgery, and the third day she tried to go out, and I 
said I gotta get to her -- so I started to go to a shipyard I 
used to run, and there was a guy there, but nobody had no boat to 
come and meet me -- so the guy was there, he said, " Come on Mr. 
Coppel, " he said, " You're doin pretty good. " , So I started to go 
-- I had two hands to operate my boat -- the steering wheel was 
all broke up -- I didn't have my steering wheel there but I had 
my controller. So I grabbed the cable on the opposite side of the 
wheel, and -- the motor will make it turn that way by itself 
because the boat will lean -- so the boat will turn by itself one 
way -- the control in my right hand, but I get halfway to the 
bayou, this hand was paralyzed. ( hard to understand) I couldn't 
use my right hand at all. So I had to do everything with one 
hand -- grab the cable like that. I didn't think I was gonna live 
-- and she said get in the car, 
I'll take you to the 
(Hospital??), at the end of the wharf -- (?) I had 500 dry rats 
that lay in the boat and a few mink and otter. She said, " Get in 
the car, 
I'll take you to the hospital" -- (?) I had two cuts, 
one over here, and I had two fractured ribs, (?) shoulder- blade, 
(?) so we went to the hospital -- it'll be ten years on the 
second of February. So I thought I was gonna die, 
but after I 
seer, them, I know I had to live. So the lady told my son to come 
pick up (?) by the old bridge over there -- ( talking very 
rapidly, hard to understand) When I come back there was another 
guy over there -- then Gilbert come out first, my son (?) 
I had another rough one, when I was nineteen years old, I 
almost cut my foot off over here, with an axe -- so I tie my leg 
over here, and they could follow me up the marine, there was 
still a mark on the ground. After they had a little rain they 
could follow me where I pass the blood on the ground. I got up to 
my pirogue I soaked my foot in the water and I did, that looked 
like somebody grab me here, each arm, 
I couldn't move (?) When 
that passed, I was completely blind. I had to paddle about, oh, 
about half a mile I had to paddle, and the well was on the side 
of the canal, 
if I couldn't see before I got to the cross -- I 
was coming to, 
like a T, 
see? I (?) opposite from the house --
but no, before I got there, I got to see again. The good Lord 
helped me that I could see before I got there so I saw where to 
turn, and I found my home, when I got to see again my foot was 
not bleedin no more, but then I had to get upon the levee, and 
that was pretty high -- I strained my foot a good bit, 
I guess 
the levee was about like this, and I walk about from here to your 
car, and when I got there my foot was bleedin again. And my 
mother and my daddy was there, so I asked them to give me a chair, 
and when I sat on the chair I pass out there. 
(Him son): He's never h=en in a hospital 
DH: When you're in the swamps back here if you get hurt or 
somethin, that's it. You either get out or you stay -- if you're 
trappin or huntin -- if somethin happens to you when you're 
trawlin 
Son: He went to the hospital, he got sewed up and came home 
8 
LFPAMHO12 
UC: Yeah, the doctor wanted to keep me in there, I told him, 
I said, " I'm only 67,years old. I never spent a night or a day in 
a hospital , I'M too young to do it now.
,, ( laughs ) See, you can't 
stay in the hospital . In the first place --•' my wife just came out 
of the hospital . So I had to be strong enough to do that part, 
and I didn't go to the hospital. Thank the good Lord for that. 
Knock on wood. 
MH: Do you celebrate Mardi Gras down here? 
UC: In Bayou LaFourche you know how we used to have Mardi 
Gras parade in Bayou Lafourche? With a wagon and horse. 
Used to 
pass all along the bayou . In other words , during the time I was a 
kid, they had the ferry -- and they didn't have none in Larose 
they had one six miles from Larose, and then three miles below 
they had another ferry that crossed the bayou. So they'd go and 
pass on one side of the bayou and then they come back, and at 
Golden Meadow they had another little ferry, they'd cross there 
and they'd go back from the other side of the bayou. There was 
Lockport -- the first town when I was a kid was Lockport, comin 
up the bayou. They didn't have any town below that. Now they got 
Golden Meadow , Cut Off, and Galliano -- that's all towns, but at 
that time they didn't have that. Just a few people, just a few 
houses along the bayou. 
Son: At that time they went house to house, 
because 
everybody lived on that road. 
DH: They still live on that road. There's very few people 
off it, cause it's a ridge. Everybody's confined to all the high 
ridges. 
UC: See, they had like around, Larose, Cut Off, Galliano, 
people had at least the front, and they go forty acres deep, thel 
th 
land 
at belonged to one perso n . An d th en there was farm (?) inr 
the back of that. Now they build street where they used to have ; \ 
the road to go on the back of the farm. There's a few farms from. 
Larose, and very little down below Larose. They got a few farms 
left, but not like they used to. Everybody had a farm at that 
time. 
An old roan had about seven acres wide, he had a family, he 
had about six - sever•, acres wide, and forty acres deep. They call 
it arpent in the depth, 
but, 
I know a family they had each half 
an acre that the daddy and the mother had when they was 
DH: A lot of this land was developed like that, because the 
land dropped and turned into swamp. So they build back levees to 
keep the tidal waters and the high water from the swamps out, so 
they'd farm on the ridge back to the edges of the swamps, which 
they do down here too still. 
In other words they'd build back 
levees to stop the tide waters from comin up on the higher ground -. 
UC: You see like on Golden Meadow, like I say, where my daddy 
was raised , they had a little over eight acres front, my grandpa 
had, and it was supposed to be forty acres deep. Just about four 
or five acres was highland , the rest was marsh, you see. Then you 
had all the marshland in the back for trappin a-nd hu;itin and all 
that. They had their own canal come from Bayou LaFourche all the 
way to what they call Catfish Bay -- that's about •
a 
little better 
than forty acres deep, and when they went to try to get our land 
back, someb o dy, th e people that took from my grandpa, they sold 
it to somebody and without my grandpa knowing anything about'.it. 
9 
LFPAMHO12., 
Now we went there, that man, his name was Donald there, he got 
another person's name on that had bought from my grandpa`­-
supposedly but he never had no deal with that man. He was.a 
friend of my grandpa, that's all. But the man that sold it, his 
name is not on there, 
it's somebody else. 
MH: Is the land marked by drainage ditches on each side 
DH: Yeah, they drained it. 
It's like that in the park. See, 
they farm in the park, and also even along back in here, what 
they'd do is build back levees and dig canals or ditches and then 
pump the water back out over the back levees, so that way they 
could claim more land -- it was dry at some parts of the season 
and under water at other parts. This way they had a way of keepin 
the water out. They also, some land they grew sugar cane at 
certain times of the year, and at other parts of the year they 
grew rice in the same place 
UC: Rice, yeah 
DH: So they had ways of controllin the water for the rice, 
cause you gotta put water in for rice, and then you drain it out, 
and you flood it again after -- it's alternate. So they had ways 
-- they'd build back levees, flood the land, plant rice, 
whatever, drain it back out, then when it's time to grow sugar 
cane, they keep it dry and grow sugar cane. A long time ago. Now 
what's sugar cane land usually stays sugar cane. But the methods 
are still the same. Only thing what they're doin now they're 
movin a lot of the back levees further back and claimin more of 
the wetlands 
UC: They had a plantation here on this side of Larose, right 
on side of ( Nanicosa?) that was built over -- that's supposed to 
be, 
people come from up north did that. Set on a big piece of 
marsh and dry, and raise all kind of things. Sugar cane, cotton, 
and everything you can talk about in the line of farmin land, 
until they got flooded twice, the levee broke or something, and 
then the first time they had rain that flooded everything -- that 
was on 19`7-28 in (?) the first time that land Delta farm was 
flooded and there was nothin but marsh. 
It was surrounded with 
levee, and then the last time the levee broke a couple of years 
ago so they didn't bother to pump it back up (?) But it used to 
be that everybody had land they had a levee in the back to keep 
the high land, and it had to be that you could dry and flood, dry 
and flood, see? 
--(break here) 
MH: What do you think about it? 
DH; It's a hard way to make a livin. 
Son: You gotta love to be out in the marsh, you gotta love 
to do the work 
UC: It's hard to stop me from work 
MH; Because you just love it? 
Son: He's grown up with it.

(entering Gilbert Bisante's) 
DH; She's taken a hat c he t to cu t th e feet off. What is your 
name? 
H: Helen 
DH: How long you been doin this Helen? ( laughs) Too many 
years? 
H: About 24 years 
DH: What is your name 
R: Rosetta 
DH: You look familiar. ( to MH) This lady over here's skinnin 
her, name's Rosetta 
MH: Do they have skinning contests around here? 
R: They told me I could win 
DH: There's an art to this. 
It takes a little practice 
R: 
s.inn_ 
snail one here and I'm goin over there to 
help them mold it. For me to skin all day I would have to have 
400 or 500 hides. Cause I can skin 300 -- I done skinned 65 
already. After the holidays they should have more. 
DH: what are they getting for the hides now? 
R: a dollar 
DH: For the big ones? What are they gettin for dry? 
R: I don't know. You have to ask Gilbert 
DH: This is a roller -- this is one of the machines where 
they run the skins through and it squeezes the excess flesh out. 
Now this used to be done by hand -- this is the prototype for 
nutrias -- this is the old skinnin board -- they put the hide 
there, then stand against it and use the draw knife to scrape it 
by hand. But now th e y use the rollers. Much quicker. 
(We get ready to leave) 
DH: Thank you all -- these are dried otter hides. Feel the 
fur. This is already tanned. That's the finished product. 
. ( there are tanned minks and nutrias too; otters, coons; 
didn't see any rats) 
Trans are 42 dollars a dozan 
(We leave) 
DH: See, Bator meat, crab meat, fish. During alligator 
season this dock'll be loaded with alligators. Mud boats. I have 
one at my house. You don't buy those -- you have to build thorn. 
i 
LFPAMHO13 
That's what they use in the marshes to go in the ditches -- and 
go in mud, slush, cause it's air-cooled. They'll have different 
sizes -- 16 hp, 25 hp. The boat over there's a Lafitte-type 
skiff. There's a fiberglass pirogue molded. The high bow is cause 
of the waves when they go in the lakes. 
They have another place that does this -- Leo Kernis M 
past the bridge. 
You'd have to come here when they're alligator huntin, 
fishin, trawl in. 
That's a crab car -- that's where they put the crabs until 
they shed their shells. They catch ern in the searays -- the wax 
myrtles, they set bushes out and they put ern in the water and the 
crabs go in the bushes to hide, when they're gonna shed their 
shells, so when they go to pick up the bushes if they haven't 
already shed their shells, they're fixin to, 
so they put ern in 
what's called the crab car and they lose the shells in there and 
they just get em out and you got softshelled crabs. 
MH: That's ingenious. Who figured that out? 
DH: Some coonass ( laughs) 
MH: When he made his boats wider did other people pick up on 
his design? 
DH: The old man? Yeah, see, a boat runs better when, the 
width of it is around a third the length -- for what they use ern 
for down there -- same thing they call a Lafitte skiff -- they 
built the boat with a high wide bow, so in the lakes, 
it could 
face into the waves, the water wouldn't come into the beat -- and 
then they built a big dip -- a real low side, because they used 
to run fish lines and crab lines -- they'd catch crabs on a line 
-- they got long trout lines with bait on it, 
and they rigged up 
a little apparatus that as the boat went along it would pull a 
line up out the water, and then when they'd get to the line where 
the crab was it would just kick him off and he would fall into 
the basket -- you understand? So he'd just ease along that line 
with the boat and the low area was so he could work on the side. 
So that's how they had the big dip in the back part of the skiffs 
and all, and then the back transom board, they got a big extended 
transom for trawling. Now those trawl boats over there are from 
offshore -- in the Gulf and all they do deep water trawling --
that's a big double rigger there -- see with the booms they put 
nets on each boom and then they drag another trawl behind them --
so they pull three different trawls. 
It's a double rigger and he 
can Pull another trawl  behind. 
A boom is an upright pole that just lays over into the 
water. He'll let em both out --
MH: and trawling is only for shrimp? 
DH: Yeah -- well they got what they call pogie beats too, 
they catch trash fists which they make cat food out of, 
for 
fertilizer -- trash fish'd be anything they catch that's not 
good. for eating. Course they get some goad fish in there -- but 
they're not interested in catchin speckled trout or any of the 
better eatin fish -- they're 
tc. rssh for fertilizer, so 
they'll catch ,lacks and other fish that's not used for human 
consumption. There's some pogie fleets in Empire -- they'll have 
a lot of boats, and they've got spotter planes that'll spot the 
fish and all, then they'll move into the areas and catch those

sh. 
They can trawl real deep or they can trawl in the shallow 
water. They have drag chains on the bottom to hold the net down, 
and floats on top to keep it open, but the floats are not-
sufficient as to hold the net completely on top of the water. So 
he can trawl at whatever depth he wants. And they use depth 
finders and stuff like that -- and when you find an area that's 
got shrimp -- they're all over the Gulf 
They trawl in this bayou here -- in Bayou Barataria, 
in the 
lakes and the bays -- but it's mostly for brown shrimp -- and 
then they catch a lot of white shrimp. 
MH: Do they have secret codes when they're radioing? 
DH: Yeah 
MH: Like what? 
DH: Well if I knew ( laughs) -- what they do, 
if you're 
catchin shrimp and you want somebody else to know, 
friends of 
yours, You'll call and you'll tell ern somethin, and they'll know 
where you're at 
MH: Does that work for oysters? 
DH: Well oyster's are big leases -- you lease oysterbeds from 
the state now, or ever, private areas -- and it's actually, you're 
oyster farming -- if somebody else is fishing in the area then 
you don't mess with his traps or you wind up with some serious 
problems just like if you walk in the bank and rob it, cause 
you're takin their livelihood. Same thing with fishing lines. 
Same thing with trappin. 
If you have land leased, then nobody 
belongs on your lease, 
if you're trappin an area that's not 
leased, you don't have it leased and the other man doesn't have 
it leased and you in there trappin before he does, and you find 
his traps, then what you do is pull up his traps and hang them or, 
his poles. That's tellin him to get out. When you're trappin, 
you're on, 
all the time. You're always on. 
It's hairy sometimes, 
cause there's competition. 
MH: What's the acceptable distance? 
DH: It can be close cause you're on a different tract of 
land and goin in another direction -- in other words, he starts 
close to you, 
but he's movie away from you, so you can tolerate 
that. But if he's tryin to move to the area that you're trappin, 
then you let him know that You're there first and You get him to 
go. 
If you don't have what it takes to do this then you might as 
well not trap, be cause it'
s almost an everyday affair that you 
run into people tryin to hunt animals on your land, or even trap 
on your land. So if they're wrong then it's a matter of " Hey, you 
get offa my land or suffer the consequences." But most people 
respect it.

MH: If it's harder to trap on the park land why does anybody 
trap there? 
DH: Well hardly anybody does trap there anymore. The people 
that's trappin is the ones that's livin right on the park, and 
they have access to the pools and the material to bring into 
them. 
MH: Is it prime trapping land? 
DH: It's good trapping land if it's controlled and not 
over-trapped and watched over and done properly. The lease that I 
had with the park, I did good. Now there's not as many animals,

which I won't go into. 
There's people that don't approve of the fact that there's 
trappin in the park. See, when they set up the park they said 
they would continue having hunting and fishing because it-'-
P,
 
of the culture of the park, but the thing is the area's opened up 
to the general public now. Everybody can hunt there -- not 
ne essarily the man who ha d th e trapping lease before. He had not-
oni,ly the trapping lease, he held all the hunting rights. So now 
that it's a park anybody can hunt in it. But people are not 
always just hunting deer, which is legal, or ducks, during the 
duck season, they're =also gain in there and takin nutria and 
other things the trapper is dependent on to make a living. Now, 
the same thing with alligators. 
Some people shoot nutria and alligators sometimes Gust for 
the fun of it, 
but that's money to the trapper. They don't give 
any permits to hunt alligators in the park, not even to the 
trappers, because there's not enough of em.

(SIDE TWO) 
DH: It's unique, 
it's one of the only National Parks you'can 
hunt iTLA You can always have trapping -- but dust to control the 
nutrias, unless they get some kind of predators back in here to 
keep the populatior'down. The ecosystem is so unbalanced that man 
needs to intervene -- and that's what the park needs to do 
People come there to see wildlife -- so if you have an 
excessive amount of hunting and trapping, then there is no 
wildlife, or it's so scarce that people don't see it. A roan can 
go in there and hunt deer, and because he's hunting deer, he'll 
see deer and he'll kill ern, 
but a visitor can come and never see 
a deer. The numbers are not there. 
If you didn't have hunting, 
then they'd have a lot of deer, 
but then you'd still need to do 
something else -- you'd need to make sure that that deer herd has 
the right numbers in relation to that environment -- that they 
don't overpopulate 
MH: What's the most amazing thing you've seen back. there? 
DH: Well, what I dust take for granted you might find 
unique -- it's no big thing to roe, 
but it is to somebody else. 
Like I took a lady down here from New Mexico and it's a 
completely different environment, and she dust couldn't get over, 
the fact that, 
it was in the summer- and they had a thunderstorm, 
and we went pirogin all day -- went all over the Bayou park and 
all, we saw alligators, and we stayed right on into the night, 
and stayed out there till midnight and they had a thunderstorm at 
night with the lightning displayed -- it was unreal, and she just 
thought it was unique and the frogs was croakin, and we seen 
otters -- we seen six otters in Bayou de Famille in the park, so 
it was great. And really, to roe, 
we didn't see a 
It was a bad time of the year- to see a lot of 
MH: What would it be like to you to see a lot of wildlife? 
DH: Well, 
in the fall of the year, or even in the early 
spring, 
in the fall of the year with the right weather 
conditions, early in the morning, you know, 
it gets cold at 
night, animals come out in the sun and warm up in the rnor-ping, 
so 
you'd see a lot of em in the morning. Same thing in the spring of 
the year with snakes and reptiles, 
it's been a cold night, so in 
the mornings they'll really come out. You'll see snakes layin all 
over, and this, that and the other. 
We have all kinds. Lotta yellow- banded water snakes, 
lotta 
cotton- mouths, water rnocassins, tremendous variety of water 
snakes. I don't even know ern all. Latta frogs, 
lotta nutrias, you 
see alligators. Lotta birds. There's not a lot here yet. As you 
go into the winter there's gonna be more and more, because 
they're gonna be migrating down. Now, you not only have birds 
migrating from the north to spend the winters down here, 
in the 
spring you gonna have other birds that migrate from south 
America that come here that doesn't go any farther north. And 
you'd be surprised how many people live here and haven't seer, a 
lot of these birds, 
becau:-c, 
as ,,, ost people do, they dust walk 
through life and don't look at anything. 
I work in the park, 
I'm in the swamps and the marsh, you 
know, and the wooded areas most of the working day, and when I'rn 
off that's where I spend my time. And I go huntin, or fishin, so, 
5 
LFPAMHO13 
I enjoy bein out there. I went out yesterday. I seen a deer, I 
didn't kill it. 
It didn't make any difference if I seen a deer. I 
enjoy just sittin up in a tree watchin the squirrels. Just took 
it for what it was. Made it nice to see the deer. _ 
Like with trapping, you gotta like bein out there, because 
believe me, 
it is a hard livin. Long hours, a lotta work, dirty 
conditions -- you're either covered with mud and blood, skinnin 
ern and this, that and the other. But you get enough back from it 
if you enjoy the outdoors. There's not that many ways you can 
make a livin and actually spend your life outdoors in the woods 
or wilderness area. 
It's a dying thing.`'Trapping is a dying 
thing. It's one of the f-w ways that you can still make a living 
in the wilderness areas. 
There's not a lot of people that's capable of doing it. 
That 
old man there, Mr. Coppel, he's in excellent shape. He'll walk 
you to death. He can take a pirogue and push pole it as fast as 
most people can run. 
MH: Did your parents speak French? 
DH: Yeah, my parents spoke French. See, when I was comin up, 
they didn't like for me to talk French, cause in schools they 
forced you to talk English. They were tryin to get people to 
learn English. So when I was smaller, even my parents wanted me 
to speak English. So I grew up speakin English, and I speak some 
French, but not real fluent. I can understand -- I can still 
count and stuff like that, but to sit there and hold a 
conversation with somebody, I have to really get ern to slow down 
an" think about what they're saying. I was in Gueydon (?) 
Louisiana one time -- that's all French speaking people over 
there, and the people I was visitin, their parents couldn't speak 
any English at all, and they Amked me, " PArlez vows Francais?" 
and I say " Ish papa Francais -- I speak not French -- and he 
laughed -- he said " Yeah, bur-yo u're tellin me in French" and 
he's tellin me in French, " Ah you speak French -- you're tellin 
me in French that you can't speak French" and I said I speak a 
little French. 
My mother realized the mistake she'd made when I was older 
and she started speaking to me in French. 
It wouldn't be hard for 
me to speak it fluently again, 
I'd just have to have someone to 
talk it to 
MH: What was that you said about the deer before? 
DH: Mon chette coeur (?) My dear little heart? ( My deer 
little hart) 
His people spoke " broken English" 
The movie " The Baratarians" has Gilbert Bisante in it --
it's about the people who settled Barataria. Somebody at the park 
may have taped it. 
The place has changed a great deal since he 
was a child. 
DH: See I was born back in there -- used to come fishing in 
this canal, now it's nothing 
used to come back through here and 
woods, theca 
come 
but a ditch. Old Bayou de Famille 
all this was still swamps and 
was no expressway. Most of the people tnat live here 
from the city, so there's not a lot of local people -- I'm a 
stranger in my neighborhood. 
And a lot of the culture is being 
lost because of this. 
A lot of outside influence here. Even in family life --- when. 
6 
LFPAMHO13 
I was comin up, on the weekends whole families would get together 
and have big cookouts -- fifty people. A lot closer knit and 
stuff like that, and all that's kinda lost too. 
MH: Did trappers work out of camps when you were younger? 
DH: Sure -- they still do today, on Bayou Segnette -- and 
Bayou St. Denis -- mostly for sport -- very few of ern live out 
there anymore. Well, now, children have to go to school, so it's 
harder. Back then, 
like this old man here CCoppell he didn't know 
anything else, that's how he made a living -- fishing, hunting, 
trawling -- he didn't have an education himself -- his children 
got an education to some extent because there were schools in 
Crown Point -- they used to drag em up during the trapping season 
and bring em to the camps and all -- it was a way of life, and 
it's changed now. 
People in my generation were brought up different than he 
was , so a lot of em just got regular jobs, they're carpenters or 
brick masons or this that and the other, -- but years ago, even 
when he was corning up -- that was just something passed down in 
the family. You learned how to hunt and to trap, because that's 
what you was gonna do, 
because that's all there was to do -- but 
ever-ything changin, for you to fit in, there's only so much land 
and so much area you can trap and fish in --
I took ray son -- ray son used to run traps with rile, 
and I've 
taken him hunting with me a few times. You know, he's just old 
enough now to do any kind of serious hunting this year. Maybe 
he'll get to kill his first deer. He's 1` years old, you know. 
He's big enough, and he's responsible enough now where I can turn 
him loose with a gun, with me with him now. 
MH: Will you mount the first one? 
DH: Oh, the first one he does, yeah 
MH: Do you still have your first one? 
DH: No 
(we arrive at the Unit headquarters) 
DH: It's different -- if you get to talking to someone my 
age -- but"everything changes. Nothin sits still. I wish it was 
still swamps and wilderness and I had it all to myself still.'
