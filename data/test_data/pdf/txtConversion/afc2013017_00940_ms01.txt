Introduction.  Karen Clark, Spanish and art teacher at Augusta Middle School. 
Interviewed Nov. 11, 2013 by Ruth Olson, in Augusta, Wisconsin. 
00:00:30 
Ethnicity Italian on father’s side and German on mother’s side. Grandparents 
born in United States. 
00:01:10 
Born in Milwaukee; came north for first teaching job in Black River Falls in 1981, 
stayed there 7 years, then started teaching in Augusta. 
00:01:40   
Description of education and degrees. Graduated from Mount Mary College in 
1981 with BA, with Art Education major and Spanish Education minor. 2006 got Master of 
Education and Professional Development from UW-Eau Claire.  Has been teaching Spanish for 
33 years, harder to find full time work as art teacher. 27 years of her teaching has had some 
Art component. 
00:02:45  
Karen may be a Spanish teacher, but art creeps in all the time. Students make 
art for Day of the Dead, do visual projects all the time, piñatas. If you are artistic, you can’t 
suppress it, it comes out all the time. If she could teach art full time, she would teach forever. 
When Karen entered college (late 1970s) there were 200 applicants for every art job. Most of 
her student teachers have found jobs; it has taken a couple of years. Karen is too far in her 
career, under the old system, to apply for another position that would be full time art; she 
would lose too much. Did an interview once for a full-time art position in Arcadia, and it would 
have been a $12,000/year pay cut. 
00:04:25   
Under old system, teachers started at a base salary with a Bachelors degree and 
no experience, and they gave you steps, increments of money for every year that you taught, 
and also "lanes" for more education. When Karen applied for the Arcadia job, she had been 
teaching enough years that she was at the bottom of her lane and also had 20 graduate 
credits. Most schools only give you credit for 7 years, and Karen had been teaching 6 years, so 
she’d be stepping backward. Under old system, once you had been at a school 7 years, it made 
it very hard for you to move somewhere else. 
00:05:40   
Teachers have to keep taking professional development courses. Under the old 
system, Karen has to take 6 credits every 5 years to renew her license, and she has been doing 
that all these years.  So when she got her Masters, she didn’t get a raise because she was 
already had 36 graduate credits. Right now, she has close to 80 credits past her Bachelors.

With new system, teachers have a professional development plan, so they don’t have to earn 
credits, but they set up a plan and you have to work toward it. Often it can include taking a 
class, but basically it’s working with the teacher standards and trying to improve areas, and 
doing work and documenting that. Right now Karen has enough credits to renew her license 
until she is 59 and 1/2; then she will decide if she will do a PDP (professional development 
plan), take more credits, or stop teaching. 
  
  
00:07:25   
Karen has taught middle school and high school throughout her career. In Black 
River Falls, she taught all high school, 6 Spanish, or 5 Spanish classes and 1 art class. When she 
came to Augusta, she taught high school--2 hours at Augusta, 2 hours at Fall Creek, then 2 
hours at Eleva-Strom, all Spanish. The 3 school districts didn’t have enough demand for a full 
time teacher, so Augusta held her contract and they shared.  She had to drive from school to 
school, about 60 miles, but she got paid mileage. Eventually it went to 2 schools, Augusta and 
Fall Creek, and then eventually when the art teacher left Augusta, there was one full-time k-12 
position that they broke into two half-time positions to bring Karen in full time for high school 
and middle school (teaching Spanish and art). They hired an elementary teacher part-time, 
and that position has now grown to almost full time. 
  
  
00:09:00  
 In college, Karen did her study for middle school and high school, and she has 
7-12 certification. She went back and got elementary art certification to be more marketable 
as an art teacher, but that hasn’t happened. She student taught middle school and loves 
middle school kids because you can fire them up. High school kids are a little jaded and too 
cool to show they are too fired up. 
  
  
00:10:00  
 Influenced to be a teacher because she had a couple of really great teachers in 
middle and high school. Had a middle school physical education teacher who became a good 
friend, and a high school art teacher who mentored her. When she was going to start college, 
she was going to be either a lawyer or an art teacher, and decided to go with art. She thinks 
now what her life would be like as a lawyer—so unartistic, but she loves to argue and debate, 
and she usually wins. Story about negotiating with a car dealer: “Do you always get what you 
want?” “Pretty much.” 
  
  
00:11:30   
Typical day at school. Contract hours at 7:45 to 3:45. Usually arrives at 7:15 to 
get ready. First class at 8:13 (1st hour art), then a prep hour, then 2 Spanish classes, then 
lunch, then Power Up, a half hour time where no teacher nor student has classes, so they can 
go to teachers and get help with homework. Students also have a core resource teacher they 
can work with. Karen helps Algebra 1 students (on easy stuff). Karen is a freshman class 
advisor, so they try to have freshman advisors take the freshman classes.   
  
  
00:13:20   
In the afternoon, she teaches 3 more art classes. She has 6 classes during the 
day, but because she teaches multiple levels she has 11 preps. The only class with one prep is 
Spanish 1. 2nd year Spanish is a 2/3 combo, so she has 21 2nd-year and 4 3rd-year Spanish 
students, and she has to balance time between them. With high school art classes, they are 
working on different projects in the room at the same time, which is easier because she can

talk to them and give feedback—not so much of a dance. For the art classes, she is mostly 
roaming around the room and giving feedback, although sometimes there is a little discussion 
or introduction at the beginning of the class. When a student says she is done, teacher puts 
the project up on the board and asks the other students to give feedback: “Is she done?” So 
the class decides when the project is done. 
  
  
00:14:54   
Spanish classes are more structured, Karen does spend time at the front of the 
room, but with the combo class, work is more hands-on. She has been using technology more 
in that class; there are 10 laptops in the room, and students use them to do independent 
work. Spanish 2 will text Karen to respond to things. She will give them some instruction, then 
tell them, “Spend some time with a partner, answer these questions, then send me 5 things 
you did last week.” They do some texts in class, but if kids don’t have a phone, or if there isn’t 
service in Karen’s room, which is a bigger problem, they can hand-write answers or turn them 
in later. Some use friend’s phone and do the work together. Then at night, Karen sits at home 
and responds to their texts. 
  
  
00:16:17   
So many schools forbid the use of phones—why use them? A couple of years 
ago, the superintendent said the School Board was trying to determine use policy, and the 
superintendent said he’d like to see what could be done educationally with phones, like 
quizlet apps etc., how to use to be interactive. A couple weeks ago Karen was at a conference 
and her phone started buzzing, getting a lot of texts and she realized that students were 
between classes and all texting her at the same time. So she could be out of the building and 
still see that her students were being productive. The other day, Karen was reviewing text 
assignments and responded to a student and realized she just sent him a text while he was in 
another teacher’s class, and she thought, “No, that’s not a good idea!” So she tries to text 
them after school. And often they respond, and so they do have dialogue. Close to 50 students 
are texting her. On the first day of school, she gives them her cell phone number and says if 
they have questions on homework, text her. So, they send pictures of a workbook section, and 
she can see what they need to do. This is her personal phone and personal time. “These kids 
live in a digital age where everything should be accessible at those times, and I--my kids are 
grown, they’re off to school--I don’t have a lot of family commitments that other teachers may 
have, and so I make the decision to open myself up to my students for that reason.” 
  
  
00:18:44   
Is there a rhythm to the work week? Week pretty much the same Monday 
through Thursday. On Friday Power Up, they have Character Education where students in a 
class (for example, sophomores) work with different character traits each year, such as 
integrity, and each has a movie and materials. Like famous people who express traits, for 
example, Martin Luther King Jr. (for integrity). At the end, the whole class will vote on one 
student who has that trait. By the end of 4 years, they will have covered 16 different traits. 
This is to make them good citizens as well as students. The Family Consumer Education 
teacher wrote a grant for this packaged curriculum, which includes all movies, worksheets etc. 
for students.

00:20:55  
 Karen’s favorite part of day changes, depending on what she is teaching. In 
Spanish, she loves teaching the imperfect tense. She has a community art class that is always 
fun, because it’s always big and for the community.  
  
  
00:22:10   
The school year falls into two semesters. The semester is 18 weeks, but they 
have 9 week quarters, so they can design a project to last 9 weeks, so they have closure and a 
grade. Sometimes they can fit more than one project into 9 weeks; it depends on the project. 
The year they did 104 concrete tiles with inset stone, it took all semester. They did an Andy 
Warhol 50th anniversary project, where they painted in Warhol style, very vibrant colors, for 
the food pantry--Campbell soup cans, Ritz crackers and of course Bush’s Beans because they 
are from Augusta. 
  
  
00:23:40   
Rituals and events during the school year include Homecoming, with different 
activities. In Spanish class, celebrate Day of the Dead. Then they celebrate Thanksgiving, then 
hunting.  If a student is going to be out of school deer hunting, they have to get pre-make-up 
slips in, get teachers to sign. The time after the holidays is the longest and hardest, so they try 
to schedule breaks in there. This year they don’t have a spring break; have two four-day 
weekends to break things up better. Everyday life gets reflected in school work. For fall 
festivals like Homecoming, floats are done outside of school with parent supervision, and a 
couple of Power Up sessions devoted to that work. Art teachers try hard not to do those 
activities inside art classes, because the cost would then come out of the art budget, which is 
smaller every year. 
  
  
00:26:15   
How much work Karen brings home with her depends on the time of year. Art 
work is harder to bring home to grade unless it is small in size.  For Spanish, she takes home 
tests to grade, because students appreciate fast turn-around; she tries to turn them back the 
next day. Giving tests on Monday is suicide for everybody; students suffer and then so does 
the teacher. Karen tries to test on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and then she has more time 
to grade. Sunday is her biggest time to grade, while the Packer game is on.   
 
00:27:20   
Uses Moodle for her Photography class. This year, the class has 16 students and 
only 4 places in the dark room, so while 4 are in the dark room, the others are in the 
classroom working on different projects. Have to turn in two photos a week, on a theme. So 
they can upload photos on Moodle, but Karen also has quotes from photographers, and other 
material students can work on, all in Moodle, plus a gallery where students can comment on 
each other’s work.  
 
00:28:50   
Karen describes her classrooms. The art room is a very large space, not well 
planned in its layout. Karen didn’t get any say during remodeling, so planning of outlets, 
workspace, isn’t the best. The architect talked with the science teachers, but when Karen 
talked with him, she was reprimanded for costing the school an extra trip from the architect.  
This year, she had new storage shelves put in. Always clutter because always so much going 
on. Painting on ceilings and walls. Science teachers saw it and asked for paint so their students 
could decorate the science room walls. The Spanish room is more traditional, but one wall is

painted lime green. Student Council one year wanted to brighten the school, so they asked 
teachers what colors they wanted. Karen told them she didn’t care what they did, so one 
morning she walked in and saw a lime green wall. The students said, “It was cheap!” Karen 
said, “I love it!” Then, students have painted and placed other things on top of it—piñatas, 
flags, objects from Mexico. Both of Karen’s rooms are visually busy, which reflects her as a 
teacher. Very stimulating environment. She told Student Council to paint the back wall rather 
than the front, because she wanted something to look at. 
 
00:31:45   
Spanish students work on the laptops. They will write compositions to put on 
the server, email Karen, go to web sites, such as one linked to their textbook, and another, 
studyspanish.com where they can practice grammar. Laptops were gotten for the 
Photography class, and normally housed in the art room, but because of the split Spanish 
class, they are being used there. When Photography starts, they will be used there. Other 
teachers use them in other hours. In use constantly. 
 
00:32:55  
 Art budget. Cleaning her room, she found her budget from 1986, $3000. Her 
budget for 2013, $1700. Grades 6-12. That’s for every student in the school, for the whole 
school year. When they started Photography, they had a $20 lab fee, now have to have $20 
fee for all high school art classes. If they pay in first week of class, they get a $5 discount, if 
they pay late, $5 late fee. Wouldn't be able to do the kinds of things she does without the 
money. Clay, glaze, all supplies expensive. Sometimes spends personal funds on supplies. Uses 
hair spray instead of Spray Fix; Spray Fix is $15, hair spray is $2, so she'll just pick it up.  Uses 
lots of recycled material; they make own sketch books. 
 
00:36:00   
Specialized vocabulary: lots of acronyms related to every new thing, for 
example No Child Left Behind.  RTI--response to intervention.  Now, Common Core Standards, 
so everything is CCSS. But also currently talk about engagement: "I can't get this kid to 
engage" which non-teachers might not understand.  Teachers also have personal informal 
phrases for school, for example, for a social occasion, TFBs (Teachers for Beers). For first 5 
minutes, you can talk about school, after that if you talk about school, you buy a round. 
Everyone's the president of TFB, so anyone can call a meeting at any time and choose a place. 
 
00:38:52   
[Recording paused because of noise of students passing in the hallway.] 
 
00:39:04   
TFBs are special occasions, but what do teachers get to do together every day? 
Teachers can eat lunch together. High school and middle school lunches are separate. Some 
teachers choose to eat in their rooms. Karen eats with same people every day. Sometimes 
negative environment in lounge; make fun of other teachers, so can make some feel 
unwelcome. Lunch is 20 minutes, so kind of crazy. 
 
00:42:35   
Lot of wonderful teachers in the school. Karen has mentored teachers, 
carpooled with teachers, lots have become good friends, so has big core of support.  Principal 
and superintendent for this school very supportive of teachers, treat them as professionals. 
Principal goes to dances, makes connection to students.  President of school board is a former

student, so sitting across the table at contract negotiations was interesting.  Joe Smith, who 
presented to students during Wisconsin Teachers of Local Culture project, is on school board. 
When he first became school board member, he decided to come sit in classes, and just 
showed up one day in Karen's class to observe and get an idea of what's going on. It's been 
good. School board doesn't micromanage, so that's good. Now teachers can't negotiate 
contracts any more, but it was interesting when they could because they'd discuss different 
topics--a businessman's perspective, etc. 
 
00:46:30   
Are relationships good in Augusta because it is a rural community, so people 
know each other in multiple ways?  Possibly--a lot of teachers live outside the district. Some 
connect in the community.  It's more the personalities of teachers who are here and who get 
hired--teachers sit in on hiring, so do have a say in who joins them. They are very collaborative 
and work together. Have done several all-school projects, like "Our Town Augusta" and 
"World War II Days" where they'd take certain days in school where everyone would work on 
project research. For WW II Days, at end of year, had big event, invited community and vets, 
got a tank to give tank rides outside.  So, Karen is still teaching art and Spanish, but to a 
greater theme--how does this impact our community? Success makes you keep doing it. 
 
00:48:03  
 Next year, Karen and consumer science teacher will do a confetti quilt project. 
Explanation of what a confetti quilt is and how it can be used to create landscapes. 
 
00:50:30   
In this community, teachers are recognized for their achievements, but "on a 
greater scale, in the state, not so much lately. I mean, the political climate has changed and--
there were times during negotiations in previous years--'Wow, the teachers get such great 
salaries'--I mean, this is such a poor community, or 'They get such great insurance,' so the idea 
that we don't have what they have so therefore they shouldn't have it--take away rather than, 
'If they had it, then I should have it,' and how to work to bring up the people that don't have." 
Karen always felt valued as a teacher; during demonstrations against Act 10, she took a 
Saturday and came to Madison with her daughter, and felt it was a wonderful community 
experience. But the fallout was big. If you look at comments online, they are polarized. During 
the height of those events, she posted on Facebook that she had never felt so little valued, 
and many former students rallied and said they valued her. But the negativity comes from the 
people who don't know her, who haven't been in her classroom, and who went to school so 
long ago that they don't know what education is today.  
 
00:53:16   
People don't understand what goes on in a school day. One day, a student 
came to class extremely upset, ready to blow. Karen gave her keys to the Spanish classroom so 
she could have time alone to pull herself together, take a friend if she needed. Checked on her 
later, and she was talking with a friend. She was better, and after that, she would do anything 
that Karen asked her to do. Later, that student took Spanish from Karen and in an activity 
where students tossed a ball around, Karen noticed her under her desk in a fetal position, too 
scared to participate. Karen nodded and smiled and eventually she joined in. Because Karen 
showed her compassion, the student was willing to take a risk for Karen. There is a time to be 
strict and a time to back off. When Karen watched her graduate, the hug she got from her was

worth everything. Some students come to school who haven't had food; their family life is 
horrible. Some say they can't do their homework because they had to sit in a bar all night with 
their parents, or they had to get up at 2 am to go get their dad because he was too drunk to 
drive, so they're tired.  "We're supposed to be teaching them stuff, but sometimes we're the 
only parent they really have." 
 
00:55:48   
"My first year teaching, I was teaching one day with a class and we were 
studying about occupations, and I was asking, 'What does your dad do, what does your mom 
do?' And I was popcorning around the room and talked to a student, and I said, 'What does 
your mom do?' 'My mom is dead.' 'Oh, I'm sorry. What does your dad do?' 'My dad's in jail.' 
Okay, moved on. A kid came up to me after class--this was, like, October of my first year 
teaching--'Why did you do that to her? Don't you know that her dad killed her mom?' No, I 
didn't! And so, I preface stuff in my class now, and I say, 'You know, I don't know your family 
situation, and if I ask about mom or dad and you don't want to talk about it, just answer me 
anything.' I say, 'Just lie to me if you want to, if you want to participate, or just say I choose 
not to participate' and move on, because you don't know what the situation is." 
 
00:57:22   
Stereotypes of teachers: old neighbor believed teachers didn't pay taxes in the 
summer. Other idea, that teachers only work 9 months a year. Karen has gone through this 
with people, asking them how many weeks’ vacation they get, if they get paid overtime, to 
help them see how much time they get off work. Maybe teachers work less, but they are 
compensated less. They are paid to do a job for those 9 months, but it is spread out over the 
year. Construction workers don't work in the wintertime; teachers aren't on unemployment 
during the summer.  Other misunderstanding: all teachers do is stand and talk in front of kids 
for 42 minutes. But you don't know how much time is spent getting ready for that 42 minutes. 
One school board member questioned prep time--he owned a machine shop, his workers get 
a 15-minute break and lunch and work the rest of the time. But they have all their supplies 
right there, someone else brings them what they need. Teachers have to do all that for 
themselves, they have to run get their own supplies, copy their own materials, etc. Some 
teachers there until 7 or 8 at night. Karen's carpool gets there at 7:15; she lobbied for this 
later time; they'd rather be there at 7 am, then stay until 4:30 or 5.  Recently Karen shot 
pictures at a dance from 8-11 pm, then worked in her classroom until 12:30 because she had 
things she had to do. 
 
01:00:16   
Karen has often had a second job; right now she has four jobs. Teaches adult 
classes on weekends, works at a clothing store at the mall, has own business to sell own 
artwork. One year she was waitressing and heard a customer complaining how much money 
teachers made. She asked him what he did--he sold auto parts. She said, 'I've been married to 
a mechanic for 20 years. I can do your job. I teach Spanish--can you do mine?' He said No, and 
Karen said 'Then don't tell me I make too much money.' Nobody questions how much money a 
cardiac surgeon makes--until you walk in somebody else's shoes, you can't judge what their 
work is worth.  After Karen's divorce a few years ago, she was ordered to pay support 
maintenance to her ex-husband because she made more money than he did.  "And they just 
took it right out of my check and I had to do something. And I jokingly said to my 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

superintendent, 'Hey, do we need a night custodian?' A couple of weeks later, he came to me 
and says, 'Our night custodian is having her appendix out, would you like to sub?' So for about 
a month, at about 3:45 I changed clothes, and I emptied my colleagues' waste baskets and I 
washed their boards and I swept their rooms, and I cleaned the locker rooms and cleaned the 
bathrooms, and dusted the gym floor for $11 an hour. But it really made me think about what 
the other people in our building do. And I had a school board member come in one day, and 
he was looking for something in the gym, and he goes, 'Are you a new custodian?' and I said, 
'Actually no, I'm one of your teachers.'  'What are you doing this for?' I said, 'I'm doing what I 
need to do to support my family.' And that was an enlightening moment for him."  That was 
right before Act 10, so Karen took the hit from her divorce, and then turned around and took a 
hit from Act 10; that is why she is working as many jobs as she currently is. 
 
01:02:52   
Stories teachers tell each other: what kids do in class, things they say.  
Sometimes teachers tell stories about things that have happened to them--like when Karen 
accidentally ripped out the back of her pants in the lounge and one teacher gave her his suit 
coat which she taught in the rest of the day. Sometimes stories about parents--for parent-
teacher conferences, you think you can't wait to meet a parent to talk about their child, then 
come out of the conference saying 'Okay, now I get it.'  There are some classes that are 
memorable, like a very strong class--some years, you look out and see all these students ready 
to go, and they follow everything you say. And other years, it's like you're talking to yourself. 
And other times you'll hear, 'Oh, wait until you have next year's 6th graders,' and then Karen 
will get them and they will be no problem. But the atmosphere in an art room is very different 
from another class.  Sometimes Karen tells stories out of school, especially to her daughters, 
sometimes about bad choices students have made. Karen is now one of the senior teachers at 
the school--there are stories that were told to her when she came to the school in her 20s, 
about previous teachers who were real characters. Some of those stories are still around, but 
there are few people who actually know the person, "but the legend stays."  There was a 
teacher many years ago who was a little wild, and the administration was trying to fire her--
she'd come to work hung over, etc. A teacher walked into the lounge one day complaining of a 
headache, and she opened up her hand to show several different pills, and she said 'How 
would you like to feel?' They finally found a way to dismiss her, but the legend lives on.  You 
want to be careful who you share stories with in the community, especially a small community 
like Augusta, because it could be somebody's niece or nephew. Have to be very selective of 
what you say. 
 
01:09:08  
Teaching has changed over time, it's become more stressful, with more 
expectations. Everything with Common Core Standards, everything with No Child Left Behind, 
all the testing stress.  Karen has met teachers from other districts, who told her that when 
students take the WKCEs (Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examination) this year, every 
teacher in the school, regardless of whether they are English, Science, Social Studies or Math, 
will be evaluated on the students' success on the tests. And every teacher will be held 
accountable if they do not meet standards. Every teacher will suffer.  The way the new 
contract is, Karen's superintendent could walk in today and fire her. That has led to a lot of 
teacher stress. Some teachers, if they are 15 minutes late in the morning will stay an hour late

at the end of the day because they don't want anybody thinking they aren't doing their job.  
Apathy among students is a huge issue today, getting those students to engage is hard. 
Technology is another issue--having to fight with kids about using their cell phones or 
embracing it. Fight the big battles, not the little ones. 
 
01:10:52   
Including local culture in school projects: art makes it easy to do. Have done 
pieces for the community center, the nursing home, fire department. In order to do that, you 
have to talk to people to find out what they've been doing. When Karen's class paints murals 
downtown, it interacts with the community all the time. Karen is always getting resources, and 
connections to people. When she researched local architecture (with her photography class), 
she interviewed people about their homes. She did some presentations around town about 
the project. One day got a call from Animal Planet, they had heard she had done research on 
Augusta houses and they wanted to find out about a haunted house there. Karen has become 
the person people go to, to learn about buildings in the community.  Karen's students do real 
work in a real place, and the projects connect the students to what they are doing. Including 
community and local culture means that you always have to be flexible in looking for 
opportunities. If somebody comes and offers you something in a community this size, you 
accept it and find a way to make it work. A lot of time Karen tells them, "I can't do it this year, 
but give me time." For example, a man brought her a mailbox that he wanted painted 
patriotically, to use for retiring flags. But he brought it to her the second week in May. She 
said she'd have something done in the fall. By Veteran's Day it was painted and part of the 
presentation. Now it is in City Hall in the lobby for people to use to retire their flags, then the 
veterans retire them honorably. "The community asked for it, and so we did it."  The student 
who painted it had to research images. Veterans came in and looked and said, 'It's all army, no 
air force.' They couldn't modify it, but it was a lesson learned for the future, to include more 
images.  Karen has a reputation, which works in her favor.  "So many teachers are talking 
about art being cut in today's budgets, and everything, and I've always said, if they say, 'You 
know what, we're going to cut the art program,' I don't want it just being me standing up and 
saying No, or my students standing up, I want that whole community going, 'No way! We 
value this and we want this.' So my goal is to make sure that the community sees what the 
students do, all the time."
