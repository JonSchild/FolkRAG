CLARK. 
SCENE—Set Cottage. Emerson enters with a 
letter 
in hand, looks at cottage, and sings as follows. 
-: 
0 :--
In yonder cot there dwells a 
chromo, 
Her form is like a 
bale of hay; 
She is as handsome as a 
hand cart, 
But she has a 
winning way. 
All the darkies try to mash her, 
She is so lovely and so bright; 
She has sent me this here letter, 
And I 
must meet her here to-night. 
CHORUS: 
I 
have got a 
Zulu rival, 
But I'll knock him out of sight; 
Although her old man has a 
cannon, 
I 
must see this girl to-night. 
He enters cottage and is thrown out of window: Mr. Clar:: enters, 
shows letter and sings: 
There must be a 
grand mistake here, 
You have tried to steal my mash; 
That ' ere wench is this coon's daisy, 
And I 
have a 
mind your jaw to smash. 
She has asked me for to see her, 
You bet your boots that I'm all right; 
If I 
am thrown out by an earthquake, 
I 
must see this girl to-night, 
4 
I 
MUST SEE MY GIRL TO-MGHT.—CONTINUED. 
CHORUS. 
Just you watch how nice she'll meet me, 
How she'll smile so sweet and bright; 
I 
am the boss of colored mashers, 
And I 
must see this girl tonight. 
Enters cottage and is thrown out. 
Both meet, shake hands, 100k 
at one another and sing: 
Both of us have been mistaken, 
Both of us have got the shake; 
When we felt the old man's cowhide, 
For the window we did break. 
This here girl is a 
base deceiver, 
About her then we will not fight; 
We will go down to Thompson's Alley 
And see some other girl to- night. 
CHORUS. 
Fare thee well, oh, false Lucinda, 
We'll get square for this here fight; 
We will buy toothpicks and water 
For some other girls to-night.

SMOKE COLORED JANE. 
Parody sung by the great mirth provokers EMERSON & CLARK, 
K. H. K's. 
Just three miles from the poor-house, in the city of Ger-
many, 
'Twos here that this false face used to stay; 
She was cook upon a 
canal-boat, she put both legs in the , 
hash, 
'Twos there that I 
met her every day. 
I 
told her she was handsome, though she looks such a 
fright, 
She would stop an Erie Railroad cattle train; 
She sold horse shoes for hot corn on the Bowery every 
night, 
Did my bony, ugly Smoke Colored Jane. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Jane, Smoke Colored Jane, they say you're insane, 
Oh, come not to my boarding house again; 
I 
caught the yellow jaundice one night when I 
kissed you, 
My bony, ugly, Smoke Colored Jane. . 
When she tried to be an actor her feet were so awful large 
They had to build additions to the stage; 
Her toes reached the gallery and some kid sawed them off, 
And this put my chromo in a 
rage. 
One night when she played Gimlet she got rotten egg bou-
quets, 
But never will she dare to act again; 
The audience tried to hang her, she got seven years 
For murdering Shakespeare, did ray Smoke Colored Jane. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Jane, Smoke- Colored Jane, from away down in Maine, 
In your presence I 
could not long remain; 
Like a 
stale limburger factory was the odor of your breath, 
My bony, ugly, Smoke Colored Jane.

LIVER-LIP LIZ. 
-: 
0 :--
Sung by EMERSON & CLARK. 
0 :---
Oh, I 
love a 
darling, a 
Thompson Street wench, 
The niggers all say she's insane; 
She fell off the tail of the comet last spring, 
And the fall may have injured her brain. 
You het she's a 
masher, this Thompson Street belle 
And with her left hoof I 
often was riz; 
The darkies eat onions to make them shed tears, 
'Cause they can't mash my Liver-lip Liz. 
CHORUS: 
Liz, Liz, Liver-lip Liz, 
She's ugly and lazy, bow-legged and crazy, 
But Liz, Liz, she knows her biz, 
None can *scoop in a 
supper like Liver-lip Liz. 
She has hands like two tug-boats, her feet would make 
yards, 
Her eyes are like turnips well stewed; 
When she gets on her ear she'll kick off your mus-
tache, 
But you must not think that she's rude; 
Her ears would make ulsters, she has a 
mouth like a 
cave, 
Oh, she is such a 
terrible quiz; 
I 
was dead and buried and spent six months in my 
grave, 
When I 
got laid out by Liver-lip Liz.

THE LANDLORD'S DAUGHTER. 
tA Parody.) 
Sung with great success by EMERSON & CLARK, K. H. K's. 
0 
In Paris, green Kentucky, 
They keep a 
tramps' hotel, 
And fifty million bedbugs 
In each bed-room used to dwell; 
In each bed- room used to dwell; 
They fed us on valises 
And the crowns of old plug hats, 
And the cook made chicken pot- pie 
From the whiskers of Tom cats. 
CHORUS: 
Each day, each day, each day 
They fed us on salt hay; 
The dogs would bark in the sausage, 
And the cheese would walk away. 
This landlord had a 
daughter, 
Her shoes were very large; 
She hired them out in summer 
To canalers for a 
barge— 
To canalers for a 
barge; 
The hand of the landlord's daughter 
All the bums and tramps would tight; 
She boiled her stockings in the coffee 
And poisoned them every night. 
CHORUS: 
Each night, each night, each night, 
It was a 
terrible sight; 
The bugs would fight with the mo,-quitos 
To hang out in her room at night. 
An original " Break Neck" Song and Dance performed by' V‘qe.-4cal 
Clark, of the K. H. K's. 
Fins'', LOVER : 
I've just come here to see my love, 
She's just inside the door, 
To me she'll ever prove true 
And faithful evermore. 
I 
bear there is another chap 
That always comes around, 
If ever I 
get a 
hold of him, 
His head will kiss the ground. 
CHORUS. 
He'd better go it rather slow, 
Or I'll catch him on the fly, 
For this is what I 
want to know, 
Who gets her, him or I. 
SECOND LOVER: 
I 
wonder who that fellow is 
Comes loafing round about, 
I'll assassinate him you can bet, 
If I 
can find him out. 
He comes to see the girl I 
love, 
He thinks he's very shy, 
But I'll go in, I 
want to know 
Who gets her, him or I.

FIRST LOVER . 
Now tell me how you come to go 
To see this gal of mine, 
SECOND LOVER :

She says she won't have either one, 
So, come now, let us 
SECOND LOVER • 
And let us be friends, for surely Nve 
Don't want her, you or I.

success 
DAN -111CRTIIY. Music by T. F. liminioss,the Piper. 
As I 
rose up last Sunday, boys, 
I 
-,:as feeling a 
kind of merry, 
Says:, I'll haw: a 
jolly time, 
So I 
crossed over to Jersey by the ferry, 
But never ao-f.n Will I 
do that sonic, 
For the consequence was frightning. 
Now, what can yon expect of a 
man, 
Filled up with Jersey lightning? 
Cnortus. 
Oh, you may talk of this, and you may talk of that, 
And you may talk of plac,.s noisy, 
But, by the—no, IT will not swear, 
But the devil is in New Jersey. 
by 
I 
ran in mud up to my eyes, 
For 
never yet was lazy, 
When a 
big policeman scooped me in, 
And he swore that 2 
was crazy. 
I 
was surrounded in a 
cell, 
With big rnosquittoes 
And when morning came, from the loss of blood, 
Sure I 
thought that I 
was dying. 
(C/torus.) 
Next day: w%.,n'. before the Judge, 
And Tae :00ked 3n Iv:. with pity, 
He says, "Young man, the sentence is, 
0: .e 
Y-.our t- :I.eavr the city." 
I 
di' 
wail t hear the rest, 
And •-
.:an bet I 
was not noisy,

stepped in New York I 
cried, 
Atay the devil shoot New Jersey.

THE DEVIL'S IN NEW 
JERSEY, 
(Continued.) 
Now when I 
got home I 
found my wife, 
Along with a 
big club awaiting, • 
She said to lay her hands on me 
That her tender heart was breaking, 
We had it up and down the floor, 
And at last I 
cried for mercy, 
When she cried,'"You sucker, go anywhere, 
But, for God's sake keep from Jersey." 
(Chorus.)

Middle of July. 
A. COMIC IRISH REFRAIN. 
Sung with tremendous success, by DAN mccARTay. 
Oh, it was on the 13th of October, 
In th middk of July, 
Oh, tlr.,• forenoon wasn't wet at all, 
And the afternoon was dry—what do you soy ? 
I 
espied a 
lovely damsel, 
Down under an Id oak tree. 
Ah, the devil a

Lid to her, 
And she said the same to me.

STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM. 
Composed and written by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
Milk and honey, Oh! its funny— 
I 
cannot keep from dancing; 
For I 
love a 
girl—she's a 
pretty pearl— 
A 
lovely belle supreme— 
She's a 
lolly-pop—sweet forget-me-not— 
And her voice is so entrancing, 
She's my honeycomb, she's my sugar- plum, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Yes, she's a 
basket full of fruit, 
She's my pretty love, she's my turtle dove. 
Her voice is like the music of a 
flute, 
And she's just sweet sixteen. 
CHORUS. 
Milk, honey, strawberries and cream (vm.), 
Like the music of a 
happy dream (
sym.). 
She's a 
darling! she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
lovely plate of peaches, 
She's a 
dandy—'lasses candy— 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Repeat Cleorur. 
I'm enraptured, I 
am captured, 
By a 
lovely lump of sweetness. 
She's an oyster pie, she's a 
chicken pie, 
Aud she haunts my every dream. 
She's a 
little maid, she's a 
lemonade, 
And the pink of perfect neatness. 
She's a 
box of dates, she's a 
bunch of grapes, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Oh! yes, she's far too sweet to live, 
Is this lolly pop, is this candy shop, 
And her loss I 
know that I 
would grieve— 
iiweet vision of my dream.

Levi Kassiday. 
IRISH COMIC SONG. 
sung by J. E. Munrar, of Mournv & MAcit 
in the laughable sketch, entitled " The Secret." 
Published and copyrighted 1879, by E. H. Heannio's, 229 Bowery and 
sent to any address, post-paid, on receipt of 35 cents. 
Now list ye to my classic lay, 
Politely hearken loudly, while 
I 
sing of Levi Kassiday, 
A. blazing star of solid style; 
From Coney Isle to Zululand, 
From sweet Coholiohoes to Newfoundland, 
Roam where you will a 
man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understan, wid a 
very fine eye for a 
nice 
young girl, 
And a 
primo judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A.-down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
Meanders he, enveloped in 
A 
brand new fresh spring suit of gaul; 
Upon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A 
Don Juhannes in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
(Chorus.) 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the " mast" in " Pinafore" 
From Asiah to Kalamazu, 
From Canada w 
to San Franciscu, 
Another one of it you'll seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassday 
( 
Chorus.)

Oh, the darkies' moonlight picnic, 
Takes place but once a 
year, 
And all the high-toned colored folks, 
They come from far and near. 
We have a 
large Pavilion built, 
Way out upon the green, 
And hosts of handsome yellow gals, 
Can always there be seen. 
CHORUS. 
The music sweetly plays, 
As around the room we glide, 
One gent and well dressed lady, 
Always dancing side by side. 
We have three dandy waiters, 
Alexander, Pete and Dick, 
They'll serve you with refreshments, 
At the darkies' moonlight picnic. 
DARKIES' MOONLIGHT PICNIC.—CONTLNUED. 
Oh, there's cake and wine a 
plenty, 
And every thing that's grand, 
And luxuries both rich and rare, 
The finest in the land. 
We dance until the day break, 
Don't we have -a 
high old time, 
And at the nioonlight picnic, don't 
We darkies cut a 
shine. 
Cnonus. 
All join hands, then cross over, 
Then back to your places glide, 
Sash-shay up and down the middle, 
With your darling by your side. 
Then you treat her to refreshments, 
Make the other coons look sick, 
Oh, what fun we'll always have, 
At the darkies' moonlight picnic.

Music, Price, 13 cts. 
WHAT legi us f 
friends always bless us, 
When golden success gilds our way, 
How they smile as they softly address us 
So cordial, good hunior'd and gay. 
But, oh! if the sun of prospority 
Has set, then bow quickly they frown, 
And cry out in tones of severity, 
Kick the man, don't you see he is down? 
CHORUS. 
So let all your hearts be honest and true, 
And do unto others as you'd have them to do 
Sickness and sorrow tray fall unto you, 
So lift up a 
man. when he's down 
What if, when you had not a 
sorrow 
Your heart was as open as day, 
Your friends when they wantA to bort ow 
You'd oblige, and ne'er ask them to pay 
What, if then, a 
friend you ne'er slighted 
You wander about through the town 
Your friend became very near sighted 
And don't seem to see you when down. 
CHORUS.—So 
let all your, Sze. 
Then give me the heart that for ever 
Is free from the world's selfish rust, 
And the soul whose high, noble endeavor, 
Is to raise fallen men from the dust. 
And when in adversity's ocean, 
A 
victim is likely to drown, 
All hail to the friend whose devotion 
Will lift up a 
man when he's down!

I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
I'm sighing, my dearest, for once glance at you 
I 
long for the home of the dear little shamrock, 
The mountain and meadow, that sparkle with dew; 
Since last I 
beheld you my heart has been weary,

And often in dreams I 
have tried to caress you, 
And you, my dear Barney, so far, far away.

I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
I'm longing for you. and those bright auburn curls 
I 
sigh for the scenes of the past in our village, 
The valleys, the rivers, and rosy cheek'd girls ; 
The Lakes of Killarney are shining before me, 
Their sweet placid waters are bright as of yore, 
And often I 
think I 
am walking beside you.. 
And talking of love by the lake's pleasant shore. 
Ah! I'll go back to Erin, &a. 
I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
So darling, be ready to welcome me there; 
I 
look for the day when we'll fix for the wedding, 
The marriage that makes us the happiest pair; 
The lark and the cuckoo will greet my arrival, 
The nightingale, too, will respond with a 
lay; 
And Barney, remember, be ready to meet me, 
For Barney, my love. I'll be soon on the way. 
Ah I'll go back to Erin, &e.

THE IRISH MAN AND THE JEW. 
By JPRRY COFIA'S 
Recited at HARRY MINER'S Opening by 
MrRPRY. 
I 
once of an Irish-man heard a 
story, 
He was climbing a 
ladder in all his glory; 
Just as Paddy had got to the top, 
A German Jew Peddler near the ladder did stop. 
When some bricks dropped out of the Irish-man's hod, 
And struck Mr. Jew right square on the nod; 
The Hebrew had on a 
new silk hat, 
And of course, he was mad as the Devil at Pat. 
He looked up at the Irish-man, and said 
What for you come so near break mine head? 
My hat is all smashed, vot I 
done mithout it? 
Dis country mit Irish-man ish crowded. 
Pat looks down from his perch, and said, 
I 
wish to the Lord I 
had broke your head; 
Or smashed the big nose on your face, 
You son of a 
lying, thieving race! 
You great big murthering thief of a 
Jew, 
But for your forefathers, the like of you, 
The Blessed Lord, so they tell 
Would be alive this day, and doing well! 
...m••1111111.--41-41.11.. 
GUESS! 
If a 
sore-eyed Bull-frog should play the fiddle for green 
horn Canary Bird to dance a 
jig with the Bald Headed 
Eagle, how many lop- sided egg shells would it take to 
masticate a 
chew of tobacco?

ANOTHER GOOD MAN GONE WRONG. 
Written and sung with immense success at Olympic Theatre, Chicago, 
by FRANK LEPTIS. 
Also the Great Hit in New York. 
This world is but a 
race, of men to gain a 
place, 
Of wealth, distinction and a 
happy home; 
Some may come in way behind, and you'll very often find 
That many .a 
noble man is left alone; 
I 
will tell you here to-night, things that pass before my sight 
The mistakes of many folks I'll put in song, 
These words I 
have heard said, or in the papers read, 
They say, another good man has gone wrong. 
In days that now are past, there is one whose name will last, 
As a 
warning strong to hundreds in our land; 
He was once the Tamman y 
true 
boss, and New York feels his 
A loss, 
to the honest workingman; 
Though he robbed our city sure, still he helped our starving 
poor, 
And comfort brought to many a 
pitiful throng; 
'Tis of poor Tweed now I 
sing, but remember just one thing 
lie was but another good man that's gone wrong. 
Throughout this glorious land, you will often find a 
man 
Who has fallen and weaved in a 
depth of crime; 
lie possesses manly traits, but is working against fate, 
To a 
life of degradation seems resigned; 
I 
am not out here to preach, but a 
lesson I 
would teach, 
A 
motto I 
would give you in my song; 
Do not pass him with a 
frown, lift him up when he is dow.A 
He may have been a 
good man that's gone wrong. 
Our preachers now so meek, they took a 
sudden freak, 
By denouncing an actress of great fame; 
From their pulpits now they preach, and their congrega-
tion teach, 
Sarah Bernhardt is a 
woman of bad name; 
In the town of Montreal, the clergymen there all, 
Denounced her in language loud and strong; 
But if they'd look more to home, they would find among 
their own, 
There is many a 
good old preacher that's gone wrong.

Price, Words and Music, 40 cents. 
On a 
beautiful Summer evening, 
When the roses were in bloom, 
While strolling in a 
garden 
Among the flowers' sweet perfume; 
I 
beheld a 
lovely maiden, 
With face so bright and fair, 
And in her hand she held a 
bunch 
Of flowers rich and rare. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! how my heart did beat,—Break. 
When I 
beheld that face so sweet.—Break. 
She is as pretty as a 
picture, 
And handled with such care, 
That sweet collection which she had 
Of flowers rich and rare. 
How anxiously I 
watched her, 
As among the plants she'd glide; 
Till overcome by Cupids dart, 
I 
hastened to her side. 
Sweet hours of bliss have since gone by, 
My fortune soon she'll share; 
And our home shall decorated be 
With flowers rich and rare. 
(Chorus).

THE IRISH BRIGADE. 
Written, composed and sung with great success, by HARRY 
W HALING. at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Now don't be alarmed, friends, at seeing me here, 
I'm a 
gem of the very first water; 
My appearance will show I'm a 
gentleman, too, 
I'm a 
son of a 
Marquis's daughter; 
NIy Mother, God bless her! she doted on me, 
Said of danger I 
ne'er was afraid; 
;o when t 
grew to manh000d, a 
commission I 
bought, 
And I'm one of the Irish Brigade. 
(iforas—Then hurrah, hurrah, for the true sons of Erin, 
The stout-hearted soldiers are never afraid; 
They're true to the core, and in death ever daring, 
I'm Colonel Shea of the Irish Brigade. 
The Irish Brigade is a 
corps true and brave, 
And for fighting, the best in the land; 
In peace they're true-hearted, cheerful and gay. 
While in battle like lions will stand; 
And I 
am their leader, and proud to say, 
My soldiers all dote upon me; 
For oft midst the roar of the cannon they shout, 
"Give a 
cheer, boys, for brave Colonel Shea,"— Chorus. 
ro the roll of the drum they march gaily on, 
Through the fields, midst the dead and the dying; 
And high in the air, through the smoke can be seen, 
The Green Flag nobly flying; 
And there it waves proudly, amid shot and shell, 
While mv men to the charge they are led. 
And they'll fight till they die, ere an inch they will fly, 
In defence of the flag o'er their head. 
Chorus. 
Then boys. give a 
cheer for the sons of our Isle, 
In gailantry, none them excel; 
For their rights and their country they've oft led the way 
And like tildiers have nobly tell; 
Theg've fought and they've conquered theirfoes o'er and 
o'er, 
in foreign lands over the sea; 
And they'd try hard again, would my stout-hearted men 
If called on by brave Colonel Shea. 
Chorus.

There is a 
sweet town, Hoboken is the name, 
It's noted for bed-bugs, mosquitos for fame; 
They wait till the night-time when you get in bed, 
And they sing Billy Taylor all round your poor head. 
CHORITS, 
They're always a 
biting, and never stop fighting; 
They sting you like lightning, and your nose they are 
lighting; 
They'll never stop biting, but always keep fighting; 
These sweet little birds of Hoboken. 
One night I 
was sitting and reading the news, 
When one came a 
waltzing away with my shoes; 
He came back for my socks and he found them so loud, 
He was bound for to have them so he brought the whole 
crowd. 
1 
made up my mind to catch these young scamps, 
With two guns in my hand and a 
kerosene lamp: 
And before I 
retired I 
got down for to pray, 
A 
ad they took guns and lamp and they whistled good day. 
Now take my advice when you go to that town, 
Just cover your head with your mother's night-gown; 
Just put a 
free lunch at the head of your bed, 
With some St. Jacob's oil and you'll lInd them all dead.

Good-Bye Lovely Lou. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS, the greatest of all vocalists, with 
tremendous success. 
Copyright, x879, by Louis P. GOULLARD. 
'Twos early in the month of May, 
I 
said to my girl Lou; 
As I 
am going far away, 
I'm going to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea, 
She bowed her lovely head. 
Then placed her tiny hands in mine, 
And I 
to her then said, 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Thi,nk of me when I'm at sea and I 
will thint- of you. 
She said, to you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought; 
Tho' I 
am told you sailors 
Have a 
wife in every port. 
I 
said, " Now Lou don't look so blue, 
Or think me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget 
The girl I 
left behind." 
Good-bye, &c. 
I've one thing, Lou, to tell to you, 
Before the seas I 
roam, 
And that is of the presents 
I 
am going to bring you home. 
An Indian shawl, a 
parasol, 
A 
tiny kangaroo; 
A monkey and a 
parrot, yes, 
And they are all for you. 
Good-bye, &c. 
I 
bid adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted on the shore, 
And something seemed to tell me 
I 
should never see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned, 
That she had gone away; 
So now, as Lou has proved untrue, 
Why I 
can only say— 
Good-bye, &c.

PARODY ON PITCHER OF BEER. 
As sung by HARRIGAN & HART in the Mulligan Guard's Pienie. 
1/1" (Deer/ by JAMES RICHMOND. 
I 
am a 
friend to the Millionaire, when he is drunk, 
Though from a .,1Iillionaire I 
am far away; 
My Pa lie is rich, he owns a wood's and a 
ditch, 
And gets seventy-five cents every day. 
He spends money free for coffee and tea, 
And often it does turn his brain; 
To see himself drinking water because he is poor, 
And the rich drink from their bottle c.1 champagne 
CEtoitus: 
Then each week in the night, each year in the inkin.h, 
It will snow, it will blow, or it will rain; 
While the rich is draining beer-kegs on some lonely street, 
While the poor man is drinking champagne. 
The poor go to Long Branch for the good of their htraleli 
The Herald and the Sun is the proof; 
They smoke $2.00 cigars, go in bathing in silks, 
While the rich have to sleep on the roof. 
Its a 
shame poor factory girls can't wear diamond ring. 
If she catches a 
mash at a 
ball, he is insane; 
He'll buy her a 
doughnut and a 
three cent lemonade, 
And imagine she is drinking champagne. 
Then take my advice, sleep on a 
cake of ice, 
If you're got a 
bad reputation, rub out the stain; 
The Queen of Cincinnati has to drink milk, 
While Dennis Kearney is drinking champagne.

But there's one request I'll make, just for my mothers sake 
Don't forget it, attend to it I 
crave; 
And when I'm far away, remember what I 
say, 
Plant Flowers on my Angel Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Then remember what I 
say, when I 
am far away, 
And sailing o'er the dark blue sea; 
And God may bless you always, if you'll do as I

Plant some Flowers on my Angel Mother's Grave. 
We'll put a handsome marble headstone o'er A.ngel 
Mother's Grave, 
To remind us of the days gone by; 
A.irl we'll have inscribed upon it our Angel Mother, dear, 
With a " Cross and Crown" engraved so bright and

And ask God to make us strong and brave; 
When wandering from that spot, plant a 
Sweet-Forge.

And some Orange Blos ,oms on Dear Mother's Grave.

Parody on Leaving the Old Folks. 
Written by BILLY LESTER, and sung by PAUL ALLEN, ESQ. 
I 
am leaving now the Poor-House, to go I 
know not 
where, 
I 
am leaving it in sorrow and disgust; 
I've. eight million in my pocket I 
stole from Viola 
Clifton, 
To try and get a 
date I 
know I 
must; 
I've a 
pocketful of gags and encores I 
bought from 
Sarah Bernhardt, 
I've been a 
tramp for over seven years; 
I 
could start a 
penny lodging house under the Fifth 
Avenue Hotel, 
And let people sleep in the drums of my ears. 
CHORUS: 
Then I 
am leaving now the Poor-House, I 
am trans-
ferred to the Coliseum, 
For trying to guy a 
couple of musical mokes; 
If I 
catch Niles & Evans stealing Eddie Booth's 
Dialect, 
I'll make them a 
present of John T. Kelly's jokes. 
Adam and Eve, From Lum and Bud Granger were 
i; 
with a 
fly by night, 
They played to eighty cents in Kankakee; 
They done a 
nice big four act with the Arnold 
Brothers from Texas, 
And statue essence with the J 
called Andy McKee 
Hyde & Behman done a 
waltz-jig along with Billy 
Emmet, 
Poor Paul Allen couldn't dance, his foot was sore; 
But yet he is a 
darling, he is mashed on Charlotte 
Banks, 
He is the pretty boy that came from Baltimore.

Widow Dunn (Parody).

Sung by Billy Carter. 
Dedicated to Harrington and Hart. 
I 
know a 
big fat widow, 
That keeps a 
livery stable, 
A 
making beds for horses that are sick, 
She's an awful early riser, 
And a 
champion appetizer, 
Like an eight-day clock 
She goes around on tick. 
She's from the country poor-house, 
Her husband was a 
tramp, 
In the English army he did beat a 
drum. 
And for singing tar-heeled Hanna's, 
Or murdering sick pianos, 
There's no marker for the big fat Widow it4.1n_ 
CHORUS. 
She Is hunky, she is chunky, 
She's as handsome as a 
monkey, 
She's a 
fairy, she's contrary, 
She's a 
lamb, I. mean a 
ham, 
She's as tall as any ladder, 
I'd slug her if I 
had her, 
And kick the chest protector off the Widow Dunn 
WIDOW DUNN (PAsony).—CoNTustrEo. 
She steals the morning papers 
Away from every door, 
She's an acrobactic, break-neck son of a 
gun, 
And at every wake or funeral, 
She goes to sing and dance, 
Such a 
tender cresture is the widow Dunn. 
She's freckled, but she's pretty, 
And well developed feet, 
She has one back tooth that weighs a 
half a 
ton, 
And at every passing stranger 
She fires an ancient egg, 
So familiar is the Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
She is moody, she is sankey, 
She's consumptive, she is crankey, 
She's rheumatic, she's lunatic, 
She's a 
bum, she weighs a 
ton, 
She is crazy, she is careless, 
She is toothless, she is hairless, 
Such a 
chronic) is the big fat Widow Dunn.

PARODY ON NEVER TAKE THE HORSE-
SHOE FROM THE DOOR. 
0: 
Written and sung by PAUL DRESSER. 
—:o:---
There's a 
little sausage factory round the corner, 
Where you get the little weenies by the pound, 
And you ought to see the butcher on the watch, my boys, 
If he sees a 
first-class poodle dog around. 
Cuonus: 
They will gather up the canines every morning, 
And throw them out behind the butcher's door; 
To one and all I 
give you timely warning, 
Never eat the weenies any more. 
There are yellow dogs and terriers in the sausages. 
And they do them up in any style you wish. 
And if you go in to a 
fine saloon, my boys, 
You will find that weenies is the leading dish. 
Citottus: 
Now I 
like to eat as well as anybody, 
But, people, don't you think it is a 
sin 
To pay them fifteen cents for their poor whiskey, 
And have a 
yellow homeless dog thrown in, 
PARODY ON NEVER TAKE THE HORSESHOE 
FROM THE DOOR—CONTINUED. 
Now the actors they all like to eat the sausages, 
Especially when they are on the mash; 
And if you go into a 
five cent boarding house, 
You will hear the people call them actor's hash. 
Just let an actor see an eight day poodle, 
Then right for a 
saloon his nobs will steer; 
And very soon you'll see the actor loaded 
In bull tarriers and second handed beer. 
For the benefit of suffering humanity, 
And all my friends who usually guzzle; 
In the future you can get all the sausages you want, 
if they find a 
dog around without a 
muzzle. 
Cuouus: 
Then call the police around you every evening. 
Tell them they must not eat a 
hog; 
But have the superintendent to notify the butchers 
Every time they kill a 
yellow dog.

Parody on Little Widow Dunn. 
Written by BONNIE RUNNELLS, and sung by the friend of the working man, 
HoN Jokni REILLY, who stands without fear whenever he does appear. 
I'vc got a 
crazy daughter, she's foolish in her head ; 
She never minds me in anything I 
say. 
She's always reading song books, never goes to bed, 
For her schooling every month I 
have to pay. 
She's stuck on the profession—on actors she is mashed— 
She's crazy for to work in Harry Hill's. 
She has challenged Murphy and Rowell to win O'I,eary's belt. 
She is the laughing stock for all the gills. 
CHORUS. 
Eileen banana, sweet Louisiana, 
Slobbery days, baby mine. 
Flaherty's frisky from drinking whiskey, 
What an education has Miss Rubenstein. 
I 
sent her to the country to benefit her health, 
For the people on our block are mighty glad. 
Ever since she's been away she's never been herself, 
And the folks they say she's raving staving mad. 
She walks the streets barefooted, wears her sister's clothes, 
Rings the door bells on our block each day; 
She's milking all the chickens, feeding corn to cows, 
And scares the people when they hear her say— 
Eileen banana, &c.

Sweet was the girl I

While walking through the park to take the evening air, 
She smiled when I

This little Deitcher girl so fair, 
Oh, she sent me a

On which was wrote— 
Her name was Beckey Gildersleeve, 
Her fader be was rich, 
Her mutter keeps a

Behind McCoomb's Ditch, 
I 
am going to meet this German girl 
Next Sunday afternoon, 
I'll treat her to a 
dozen bier's, 
And catch her very soon. 
(Break.) 
(Break.) 
I'll put on me Sunday clothes 
And won't I 
look gallus, 
With my swallow- tail coat, 
Double-breasted in the back, 
I'll pay five cents on the steam locomotive 
And to her house I'll ride on the railroad track; 
I 
expect there will be a band, (Break.) 
At the depot when I 
land. 
To escort me to my Beckey's house, 
Und then her folks will see, 
Or else a 
half a 
dozen clubs 
Be waiting there for me. 
And if I 
don't get her consent, 
I 
know I 
turn a

And cut my throat with a 
bar of soap; 
That will end me very soon.

Wearing high hats like a

All the gang will sure be down.

All the Irish will be there, 
Bring along your Bridget fair; 
Make her wear her Sunday hair,

Won't there be a

When the gang gets in a 
row; 
None but buffaloes will be there, 
At Casey's Tin Pan Wedding. 
There will be ale, stale beer and whisky, 
Goose chowder and cat pie; 
And when Casey he gets tipsy, 
lie will slug Riley in the eye; 
Old Pat Shay and Tim Maloney, 
From the town of Donnegal 
Danced a 
reel for stale bologna, 
On the top of Casey's wall.

Only the Way on the Stage. 
Composed by FRED. J. M ACKLEY and sung by HENRY GRAHAM. 
If you will listen to me, some facts I 
will mention, 
Concerning the past and the present strange age, 
nd in them, my friends, to you I'll relate 
Some things I 
saw one night and played on the stage; 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And went for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
N. then we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new drama was played on the stage, 
'1 he first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging, she quite old in age, 
'1 hose sad means she tried to keep her from starving. 
A 
very sad lesson of life's book a 
page; 
hut a 
policeman passed by, his face seemed all smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages, 
Ind he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
He'd murdered a 
man, by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed. 
The jury looked stern, and the judge in a 
rage, 
And they hung that.rich man for he murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
in the next scene I 
saw a 
clergyman _ rom Brooklyn, 
Who was dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one from Jersey was playing the violin, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed; 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine sermon on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that they practiced each sermon they preached, 
But a 
was only the way it wr s 
playect on the stage.

Lend us your attention, 
And we're sure you'll easily guess, 
That we're a

You can tell it by our dress; 
We're very sanctimonious, 
Never struggling with the truth, 
Uncle Abe and sister Ruth. 
Cuoitust 
Then oh! my! we feel delicious, 
Then oh! my! we feel delicious, 
Then oh! my! we feel delicious, 
And dancing's our delight. 
We never let the congregation, 
Know we dance and sing; 
They'd elevate their eyes and say, 
It's not the proper thing. 
We steal away to visit you, 
And please you 'tis the truth, 
Uncle Abe and sister Ruth. 
We're going back to Quakertown, 
We'll take the early train; 
And when the watermelon's ripe, 
We'll visit you again. 
So keep us in your memory, 
This maiden and this youth, 
Uncle Abe and sister Ruth.

THE BOWERY AND HESTER FIRE 
Written when the London Clothing Store was on tire. 
Sung by 
FRANK LEWIS to describe scenes on the Bowery; to which 
he appeared to ten encores. 
A week ago while strolling down 
The Bowery by daylight, - 
I 
saw a 
clothing store on fire, 
It was a 
fearful sight; 
The smoke hung o'er me like a 
pall, 
But when the wind arose, 
Some funny sights they met my gaze, 
Which I 
will now disclose. 
There was Tony Pastor couldn't move, 
lie seemed so jolly fat, 
'Till shot by George Rickert's gun, 
Which wouldn't kill a 
cat; 
Wrapped up in Coogan's banner, 
The sights he did admire; 
Was Talmadge looking for a 
text 
At the London clothing fire. 
There was Billy Cameron trying hard 
Through Mrs. Falk to see, 
Harry Miner trading litho's off 
With great Jack Haverly; 
Cleopatra's needle stalking round, 
The thing that Nicoll wants, 
By his electric light to mend 
His latest style of pants. 
The Atlantic Garden Female Band 
Were trying to play a 
tune, 
The big drum lost her hoopskirt, 
Which was found by the trombone; 
Pat Rooney lost his diamond ring. 
Which considerably raised his ire, 
They burnt up the Chinese letter 
At the London clothing tire. 
THE BOWERY AND HESTER FIRE—CONTINUED. 
From the market down in Hester Street 
The bums they came to look, 
They drank some whisky on the way 
They bought of Barney Rourke; 
Mr. Finck the Alderman, he stood 
And brandy wished to take, 
To brace him up when he should vote 
For John O'Brien's sake. 
The big dwarf at the museum 
The big-headed boy did mash, 
Fred Lubin got his dye-brush out 
And touched up his moustache; 
Owney Geoghegan's English Boxers 
To a 
black eye did aspire, 
Threw George Hall and Patrick Hickey 
At the London clothing fire. 
Clara Morris she was there, 
With the crowd she had a 
tussle, 
She was struck in the back with a 
beer- keg, 
And it busted her paper bustle; 
Dan Paterson stood up to tight 
A 
round with Buffalo Bill, 
Henry Witt he took a 
Russian Bath 
The beer inside to kill. 
Peter Cooper came to celebrate 
His ninetieth birthday, 
Gordon Bennett had another row 
With little Freddy May; 
Mayor Grace then walked in and sat down 
The ladies to admire, 
Had the seat of his pants burnt full of holes 
At the London clothing tire.

I

She'd spoil up any man, 
A

This little Maggie Ann. 
CHORUS. 
This little Maggie Ann, 
This rosy Maggie Ann, 
She'd strike you blind dumb, 
This sweet little plum, 
This slick and entirely bewilderin' young girl, 
They call little Maggie Ann. 
This rosy Maggie Ann, 
A 
Vaynus is she, 
Whatever that may be, 
Is little Maggie Ann. 
She used to be a 
working-man 
Down in a 
laundry fine, 
And wrestle wid discouraged shirts, 
Till wid new life they'd shine. 
But she bekem high-tony, as 
Would any other man, 
And now a 
rale pure Irish nurse 
Is little Mary Ann. 
This little, Sze. 
The babies all she washes, 
And then irons them out well, 
And fetches them a 
lively slap, 
If out of tune they yell. 
A 
fancy night-cap then she wears, 
This French Hibernian, 
Then to the Park wid all the babes 
Glides little Maggie Ann.

Great Grandma Sarah Sane, 
Written by James Richmond and sung by Billy Barry, 
with great success. 
AIR—Fire in the Grate. 
Grandma has tendered her resignation, 
From this wicked world of sin; 
She packed her valise and departed, 
It contained a 
pack of cigarettes and some nigger gin 
She left her false teeth to Cousin Minnie, 
She gave pa the price of a shave, • 
They put Dennis Kearney's picture on her tombstone. 
To keep the crows from off her grave. 
CHORUS— 
Her mind was always mashing, 
She was too fresh and awful shrewd ; 
She weighed ninety pounds when in fighting condition, 
And she never smoked or chewed. 
She used to go fishing with Christopher Columbus, 
And shooting shadows till she went insane, 
For a 
curiosity she took the prize, 
My great grandma, Sarah Jane. 
She tried to sing bass and swallowed her teeth, 
Her lungs from eating snuff were sore; 
She was so bashful if there was a 
man in her room, 
She'd get up and shut the door. 
She willed her voice to her uncle's nephew, 
When she died she was one hundred and eighty-seven 
They say she is cook in a 
five-cent restaurant, 
Four miles and a 
half from Heaven. 
Her mind was always, etc. 
CTEM OF THE EMERALD ISLE. 
ords and Music by PAT FEENECY, and dedicated and sung by 
JOHN WALsu, the Great Irish Vocalist, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, N. Y. 
I'll sing I:19W in praise of the gem of old Ireland, 
Whose names are respected by friend and by foe; 
Of the men who proud to acknowledge their sireland 
Of men who gained fame by words and by blow; 
Their hearts brave and true, never knew any danger, 
As cheerfully they for their country did toil; 
It must be acknowledged by friend and by stranger, 
That they were bright gems from the Emeral Isle. 
First is Brian Borue, the great King whose example 
If followed by Monarchs of this present day; 
A blessing would prove, for his wisdom was ample, 
He knew how to rule in a 
true Kingly way; 
Brave Patrick Sarsfield, exiled from his sireland, 
Exclaimed as he died on a 
foreigner's soil; 
Oh, may heaven grant freedom for old Ireland, 
Then died a 
bright gem of the Emerald Isle. 
if we boast of our gems, surely no one can blame 
When we've produced men like those I 
will name; 
lialfe Wallace and Tom Moore vvho made themselveu 
famous, 
With music and poetry they gained their fame; 
There's Sherridan, Goldsmith and Swift, three more 
great men, 
What nation on earth ever equaled their 
l'here's Davitt, Daily and Killen, three more great 
Statesmen, 
MI these are bright gems of the Emerald Isle.

PARODY ON " BABY MINE." 
Words by DAISY REMINGTON. 
Sung by BILLY HINES. 
l've a 
kid that calls me daddy, 
Faro mine, faro mine ; 
If I 
play he'll treat me shabby, 
Faro mine, faro mine. 
For I 
bucked the other night, 
And I 
didn't play quite right, 
I 
got coppered out of sight, 
Faro mine, faro mine, 
And I 
went off on a 
tight, faro mine. 
He is learning how to deal, 
Faro mine, faro mine; 
I 
hear he's on the steal, 
Faro mine, faro mine. 
But I 
ought not to kick, 
For if he takes a 
trick 
He will make his partner sick, 
Faro mine, faro mine, 
And he'll have to drop his trick, faro mine. 
He's the thumper of the ward, 
Faro mine, faro mine; 
He will die tied to a 
cord, 
Faro mine, faro mine. 
He's a 
son just like his sire, 
The gol darndest big old liar, 
To seven-up he does aspire, 
Faro mine, faro mine, 
He would make a 
great town- crier, fan mina.

THE BRADY'S FROM TRA-LEE. 
Written by Mn. J. P. SULLIVAN, and sung with unbounded applause 
by CuoNni & SULLIVAN in their original and laughable Sketch, 
Entitled, " Just Landed." 
We're an honest Irish couple, 
As you can plainly see; 
We left our native land behind, 
So far across the sea; 
We're just landed in America, 
The Home of Liberty; 
We are Dan and Nancy Brady, 
From the town of sweet Tra-lee. 
CHORUS: 
Then give us both a 
welcome, 
To the birth-place of the free; 
We're an honest Irish couple, 
Our hearts are filled with glee; 
We will treasure up your kindness, 
Wherever we may be; 
We're Dan and Nancy Brady, 
From the town of sweet Tra-lee. 
We left our homes in Ireland, 
And it grieved our hearts full sore; 
But the famine it was raging, 
People dying by the score; 
The landlords had no pity, 
So we were forced to flee; 
And seek a 
home in America, 
Far, far from sweet Tra-lee. 
(Chorus). 
Now, we'll pray God bless poor Ireland, 
Wherever we may go; 
God bless the land that sent us aid, 
To help us in our woe; 
The griping band of famine, 
May your people never see; 
Is the prayer of every Irishman, 
And the Brady's from Tra-lee. ( Chorus.

Written by Edwin Talbot, and sung with greas supexas Lag 
Pat Rooney. 
Ain—Bogie Man. 
The boys hanging around the public baths, 
How patiently they wait, 
The policeman tries to keep them quiet, 
And pass them in the gate, 
They push and pull to sneak in twice, 
And get another swim, 
But the copper drops and tells them, 
Young fellow that's too thin. 
CHORUS. 
Then cheese it, Jimmy, cheese it, 
Now lay bones for your chance. 
Don't you see the copper will sneak, 
And slug in the pants. 
Then cheese it, Petey, cheese it, 
I 
tell you he will drop, 
Now go and dry your hair now quick, 
Now sherry here is the cop. 
They put seventeen boys in a 
little room, 
About as big as a 
dry goods box, 
You'll hear them say, my clothes is wet, 
I 
wonder where is r, cks, 
They put on their shoes upon the dock, 
Buy a 
bolivar if thieve got tin, 
'lien dry up their hair and watch the police, 
And work the bath again.

THE EMBLEMS OF IRELAND 
As sung by 
LL II. MoirroN, America's Combine, at the Academy of 
Music, Chicago, Ill. 
I 
wear two lovely emblems, 
I 
wear them on my breast, 
The harp entwined with shamrock 
Is the emblem I 
love best, • 
They're symbols of old Erin, 
Thc place that gave me birth, 
The sacred spot of Erin 
the dearest spot on earth. 
CHORUS. 
The harp and the shamrock of Erin, 
The harp and the shamrock for me, 
When ' ere my voice I 
raise I'll always sing in praise 
Of the harp and shamrock of Erin. 
When I 
see a 
bunch of shamrocks 
I 
think of St. Patrick's day, 
And if I 
hear its tune struck up, 
It makes my heart feel gay, 
My spirit overcomes me, 
And on Erin sweet I 
call, 
Just touch the harp of Erin, 
And 
sing Tara's Hall. 
The old stone cross of Ireland, 
Is an emblem great and grand, 
With the wolf dog resting calmly 
Near the round towers of our land, 
Their relics dear to Irishmen, 
No matter where I 
roam, 
Good men are always firm and true 
To emblems of their own.

We do the darling essence, 
And the Pompey Negro Act.

Our Irish business it's immense, 
My brother he's a 
clown; 
We get thirty dollars for the two, 
You bet we own the town; 
Now don't you try to guy us, 
For we have seven mothers, 
We are Steve and Larry Madden, 
Known as the Bowery Brothers. 
We played in Tiffin, Ohio, 
We used to sing " My Gal;" 
We worked for seven seasons 
Along with Happy Cal. 
Edwin Booth says we are daisys, 
He offered us twenty dollars joint, 
But we are going to open slaughter houses 
Away down at Hunter's Point,

Bobby's Appeal to His Ma. 
As sung by R. HUNTING. 
Give my boxing gloves to brother, mamma, when I'm dead, 
When the sexton puts me under—in my little bed ; 
Irthe job is like to throw him when the string he jerks, 
Get some little boy to show him how the old thing works. 
Mamma, buy me a 
bran new ulster, hire a 
Pullman car, 
Give me a 
bath in Florida water, for I 
see the gates ajar; 
Give me a 
dose of paregoric, there is nothing about me mem; 
Give the sexton a 
half a 
dollar to see that my grave is 10-•'pt 
green. 
Give my chewing gum to sister, I 
don't need it more, 
On my gums it raised a 
blister, they are awful sore ; 
Give away my ragged jacket, mamma, don't you cry, 
In the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, how is that for high ? 
Hit me with a 
big tomato, stab me with a 
pie, 
Let me bite my little sister in the sweet by and by ; 
Smother me up with water melons, give me a 
little sugs and 
gin; 
Fill my stomach up with gum drops, then wipe off my little 
chin. 
Throw me in a 
bed of apple dumplings, I 
want to go out West; 
Put a 
porus plaster on my stomach, then pull down my tittle 
vest; 
Mamma, I 
want to be an angel, mamma, what'd you saf ' 
I'm getting hungry, I 
could eat a 
bale of hay.

PINAFORE. 
Words by JOE PETTINGILL, of the AMERICAN Form. 
When I 
was young and had no sense, 
I 
went to a 
picnic and I 
beat the fence, 
I 
had just dropped over and hid in the grass, 
When a 
copper hauled off and struck me in the neck, 
And for beating that picnic so carefully, 
I 
got six months in the penitentiary. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
When I 
arrived at the age of eleven or more. 
I 
stole all the sweet potato.'s from the grocery store, 
I 
stayed out late at nights and wouldn't go home, 
.Just look at me now Fm nothing but a 
bone, 
But I 
stole those potatoes so carefully, 
That now I 
am the owner of a 
grocery.

-11114PTY DLINIPTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
ft is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by aui 
the Professors of Magic. 
• 
PliiMAMPOW ria" 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom. 
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordet 
has been sent us, called 
DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as . to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear• 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking ii 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap • 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at .home in the hanc% 
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
