Such an Education Has my Mary Anne. 
By Edward Harrigan. 
Music by David Braham. 
Sung in Harrigan's great sketch, The Mulligan Guard Picnic. 
Copyright by A. J. FISHER, 1878. 
My Mary Anne's a 
teacher in a 
great big public school, 
She get's one thousand dollars every year, 
She has charge of all the .children, you'd never find a 
fool, 
For Mary gives them all the proper steer. 
Oh, she studied Greek and Latin, rear French and Timbuctoo, 
German, Spanish, Turk and Hindoostan, Portuguese, Irish 
and Jerusalem Hebrew; 
Such and education has my Mary Anne. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
dumpling, she's a 
lamb; 
You should hear her play the pi-an-a, 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
My Mary Anne's a 
lady, no contemptible coquette, 
When I 
see her sure my heart goes in a 
drame; 
She is thoroughly conversant wid the art of etiquette, 
And at cards she'd beat old Hoyle himself a 
game. 
Oh, she'd play you whist 00cribbage, forty-fives or casino, 
And she'll dale the cards just like a gamblin man, poker 
peaknuckle, or Sanky oh Pedro, 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
She's a 
darling, (tc. 
My Mary Anne's a 
dancer in the art of terpsichore, 
You should see her forward four and alamandi; 
She'd break up all the lumber that you'd put down on the floor, 
Such a 
heavy stepper is my Mary Anne. 
Oh, she'd (lance you the mazourka, a 
polka or quadrille, 
Reel or jig or shuffle in the sand, schottishe or the German you 
could'nt keep her still. 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
She's a 
darling, ac.

Last Sunday afternoon I 
took my wife and children, 
I 
hired Dennis Grady and his beautiful painted hack; 
Across the River Hudson, where there's seagulls by the million, 
We were out for a 
day of pleasure to the town of Hackensack. 
CHORUS. 
I'll ne'er forget the hour my wife and niy boy, Jack, 
We all got inside to take a 
ride in Denny Grady's hack. 
Our horses were first-class, fresh and rosy from the stable, 
kdapple mare named Barney, that would stand without a 
whoa--
And a 
little sorrel grey that he called Hardly Able; 
Ile was a 
honey cooler when he determined not to go. 
I'll ne'er forget the hour, Sc. 
A 
funeral came along, these horses them did follow 
Right behind the hearse in a 
regular dead- march line; 
Denny said " get up," like a 
trapper he did holler, 
But right or left they wouldn't stir tiil they saw a 
tavern sign. 
I'll ne'er forget the hour, okc. 
Denny gave them water with the devil in his eye, sir, 
Saying, " I'll make the blackguards trot:" 
Then the horses gave a 
wink just as if they said 
Mister Grady, you're " Dry, sir, 
the devil a 
foot 
Will we move from here till all hands get a 
drink." 
ne'er forget the hour, Lt-c.

I 
sing of my loved one, an idol to me, 
Though parted we are by the deep rolling sea, 
My thoughts gladly wander to Erin's green shore; 
Where dwells my treasure, mavourneen astore. 
By the side of a 
brooklet, a lear running stream, 
I 
fancy I 
see her, my Irish colleen.

Oh, there's no girl fairer nor lovelier than she,

How you strived or to keep the sad tear from your eye, 
Saying, Paddy, God SaVe you, and send you safe home 
To the heart that is melting for you ! ill alone; 
Sure don't I 
remember the promise I 
gave, 
How I'd go back to Ireland when money I'd save. 
Oh, there's. &c.

MY MARY ANN. 
Written for Miss KITTIE O'NEIL, by ED. lImiurGAN 
On ! My Mary Ann is an artizan, 
In a 
factory 'way down town ; 
She makes umbrellas for the high-toned fellers, 
And she lives six stories from the ground, 
In a 
brick tenement, where they cut up devilment 
Every night in the week and every day. 
My sweet Mary Ann walks out upon Vie sand, 
Ev'ry summer at Rockaway. 
Her big brother Dan is a 
laboring man, 
On the pipes he's a 
civil engineer; 
His feet are as large as a 
picnic barge, 
He wears gurh drops in his ears, 
lie has a 
voice like a 
thrush, and he feeds on mush, 
He's fond of his sister, they say. 
Sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
With her big brother Dan at Rockaway. 
Sweet Mary Ann plays the grand pian. 
She never studied notes from the book, 
The music clear lays all in her ear, 
As she rattles it off with her hands. 
Sunday night, when the parlor's full, 
And dear Camelia May will you give me a 
welcome here? 
Then sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
Every summer on the beach at Rockaviay. 
II ai:RAGAN. 
Oh, I 
love to see the ships 
Sail in from foreign trips, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
mermaid in the water, 
Or e!se a 
little pearl, 
Or the darling little girl 
That the sailors call jolly neptune's daughter. 
Then when a ship would wreck 
I 
would jump upon the deck, 
Or through a 
golden horn I 
would hail her; 
I 
pick out from the crew 
Some jolly tar in blue, 
For my heart is r.iways on a 
sailor. 
I'd be as constant as the dove 
To my bonny own true love, 
If he left me the seas to go a 
roamin'; 
I 
w 
I 
dream at night of him, 
Aloft in a 
gale of wind 
You'd never catch Inc sighing or a 
moaning. 
Saying " I'll meet my darling boy 
With his jolly ship ahoy; 
Who'd be a 
lawyer or a 
tailor, 
I 
never will get wed 
Unless my husband tread 
The deck of a 
vessel as a 
sailor. 
DARBY'S RIDE. 
As sung by GEORGE BRAIIAM. 
LAST 
Sunday afternoon, when the flowers were in bloom, 
With the darling ef my heart all by my side; 
In a 
new- made French coupe, bound down for San Jose, 
I 
gave my sweet Johanna a 
litirgy ride. 
With a 
horse that went in three, we drove most socially; 
Like Sharon I 
along the road did glide. 
And every passer-by, with a 
twinkle in his eye, 
Said Darby has Johanna out to ride. 
Oh, when I 
said •" go ' lam; !" to my Mexican mustang, 
Ho started like the devil in a 
gale; 
Put his ears back on his head, so beautiful he sped, 
Which gave an elevation to his tail. 
He smelt something in the air which made him rc r 
and tear; 
He threw us in a 
ditch both deep and wide! 
Then the neighbors come about and fished the two of us out, 
Saying Darorgave Johanna a 
muddy ride. 
When we found the horse he was eating up it corpse 
Of an animal so beautiful to behold! 
'Twas no grizzly, or a 
monk, but a 
California skunk 
That he was chewing up and give ballyhoo! 
When he got his fill like a 
lamb he stood quite still 
'Till in the wagon we set side by side. 
Now Sunday afternoon, covered with perfume, 
Will Darby take Johanna out to ride ? 
SOLID GANG. 
Written by the lion. MICHAEL BRADLEY. 
W E'RE voters in Manhattan Isle, 
The wards we represent; 
We must have our sling in the rako 
Of money that is spent 
To elect the Governor. 
On us you kin depen— 
When there's a 
kick in your district 
Call on the solid men. 
("Horn 7s. 
Then all fall in ! 
Put your shoulder to the wheel; 
Vote with us, 
Not a 
penny would we steal. 
We call the turn 
In the corner where we hang; 
We're the mob who never rot, 
We're the solid gang. 
We carry the State for our candidate, 
You bet he can't be beat; 
He's bound to win when we set in 
To vote and to repeat. 
He must put up for all of us, 
From a 
dollar up to ten; 
When he's around he must come down 
To these 'ere solid men.

Of late I've had some funny thoughts, 
I 
don't mind telling you 
Of this next hundred years to come, 
And what ' twill bring to view, 
The things that will be said and done 
And the million little tricks, 
Will go to make a 
wonderful change, 
In nineteen seventy-six. 
Things will be accomplished then 
The greatest ever heard; 
People then will sail around 
On wings just like a 
bird, 
Rings and third terms looming up, 
With White House politics, 
We'll probably have an Emperor then, 
In nineteen seventy-six. 
Woman's rights will be in force, 
And women cast their votes, 
Men stay at home to mind the babes, 
And wear the petticoats. 
They'll marry and get divorced in a 
day, 
Make money with bran new tricks. 
Free love will be served up on toast 
In nineteen seventy-six. 
If this great big United States 
Keeps on as from its birth, 
We'll knock the tar right out of any 
Nation on the earth. 
But there's one thing I 
want to say 
Before I 
cut my sticks, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar I 
ain't alive 
In nineteen seventy-six.

THE old man ain't himself no rno', he's nearly gone to seed, 
And these hands refuse to do the daily toil: 
I 
never drearn'd ' twould come to this, or that I'd be in need, 1 
After years of service in Carlina 
My limbs are bending ' neath their weight, my hair is white as 
snow, 
And I 
cannot see the gentle summer sky ; 
My feet grow weary day by day, my step is weak and slow, 
And I'm gwine to leave my comrades by and by. 
Cuout-s. 
The old man ain't himself no mo'. he's nearly gone to seed, 
And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to seed, 
And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The good old days when I 
was young have flitted like a 
dream, 
And I 
hardly knew that I 
was growing old; 
never stopped to 
think how these poor arms of mine 
would seem, 
If the poor old man was left out in the cold. 
But now I 
know the feeling well, it almost breaks my heart 
For to think that I 
must die away from home. 
Oh, if I 
could be young again, to- morrow I 
would start, 
And to old Carlina's shores I'd quickly roam. 
The old man ain't himself, etc. 
I 
long to see the cotton fields, the tall Palmetto trees, 
And to hear the happy darkies shout and sing; 
I 
never shall forget the good, the old plantation glees, 
Or the way we used to make the banjo ring; 
But all is nearly over now, the trumpet soon will sound. 
Then 1.11 have to cross the river over there ; 
And when I 
set my aching feet upon the sacred ground, 
I 
shall know no mo' about this worldly care. 
The old man ain't himself, etc.

The Songs My 
Mother Used To 
Sing. 
Sung by SAM DEVERE. 
The songs my mother used to sing, 
Could I 
but hear them once again, 
To childhood's memories still they cling, 
They soothed my every ache and pain. 
Oh how sweet they used to seem, 
How they made my heart rejoice; 
Years, long years seem but a 
dream, 
Still I 
hear my mother's voice, 
CHORUS. 
Childhood's days to me so dear, 
Sweetest recollections cling; 
How I 
often long to hear 
The songs my mother used to sing. 
Those sweet and simple little songs, 
Songs I 
loved so well to hear; 
How they'd heal my childish wrongs, 
how they'd seem to please and cheer. 
Songs in memory buried deep, 
Songs that oft put me to rest, 
Songs that closed my eyes in sleep, 
Lying on my mother's breast. 
Every simple little strain, 
Calls to mind some happy scene, 
Brings up childhood's days again, 
Days to me yet fresh and green ; 
Better to me than glittering gold, 
Greater by far than crown of king; 
Dearer to me than all the world, 
Are the songs my mother used to sing.

THE BLACKBIRD AND THE CROW 
Written by W. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
When we were in the South. 
On Massa's old plantation, 
That's where we had good times, 
Just when the Sun went down. 
We used to sing and dance 
And play the old banjo— 
That's how it was they christened us 
The Blackbird and the Crow. 
Cuonus. 
We always were so happy, 
Myself and Bro. Joe 
I 
think that's why they christened us 
The Blackbird and the Crow. 
'Twas then we had no cares, 
Our hearts were free of sorrow 
No chance had we to fret, 
For joy was in full flow. 
And all the other slaves, 
Kind feelings for to show, 
Would come to hear our songs, and cheer 
The Blackbird and the Crow. 
We always were, S:c. 
LANDLORD I 
AM GROWING THIN 
Written by W. H. DELEILINTY. 
Aitt.—" Darling lam Growing Old." 
Oh ! Landlord, I 
am growing thin !—( So thin.) 
And my cheeks are falling in !—( Sunk in.) 
The bones are coming thro' my skin !—(My shin.) 
I'm like an old fashioned clothespin !—( Close in.) 
Ah ! won't you change your bill of fare ?—("o 
spare.) 
Yes ! that's my morn and evening prayer.—( I 
swear.) 
Go throw that bad hash in some sewer !—( It's poor.) 
And send away that old hash chewer !—( For sure.) 
Ants.—" Hildebrand" and " Tra-la-la George." 
For it's hash—dry hash—so badly chewed. 
I'd rather it was pound cake—but do not think I'm rude. 
And if, by chance, you hear a 
sudden crash_ 
Be sure that I 
have busted, by eating too much hash ! 
For it's landlord ! Dear landlord ! 
You'll get no pay for my board. 
It's too hard be so bored 
With dog meat hash—oh Lord. 
Hash thou no feelings, gentle host —( Sweet host.) 
_Behold in Inc some poor dog's ghost.—(Almost.) 
Those cowhide steaks are much too tough —(And ro-ugh.) 
And taste just like warmed over snuff.--(That's ) 
Your coffee, too, is awful thin.—(Too thin.) 
just throw in one more roasted bean.—(One bean.) 
And put a 
muzzle on that cheese.—(0h, cheese.) 
Go stab them fish balls, landlord, please.—(Do please.) 
Chorus as before. 
Oh ! landlord, give me coal to eat.--('Tis sweet.) 
But of your sause a 
little bit.—(Then git.) 
Your hash-room door you'll please to close.—(Yes, close.) 
That no foul smell goes up my nose.—(My horn.) 
But that fat cook, oh, yes ! I

She ought to shoot that greasy dress !—( 0h, grease.) 
Discharge that cross-eyed waiter, too.—(Do, do.) 
And bathe your shirt, you're Irish, Jew.—(You Sheeny.)

Please to listen to my story 
While the spell of love is o'er me, 
And my heart beats high for glory, 
Of a 
1: sting menCry sweet. 
T. forget not, but remember, 
Of an evening in Soptember, 
When a 
maiden, young and tender, 
'Twas my lucky chance to meet, 
All alone, out in the Forest, 
in the twilight's dusk and gloom ; 
And she acted shy and modest, 
When I 'f
.Lsled to see her home. 
She had been out on a 
pic-nic, 
Where they tripped the light fantastic, 
But my hear.'s joy was ecstatic, 
When I 
saw sweet Annie home. 
CHORUS. 
Out in the Forest with Annie. [Symph] 
And there telling love tales many. [ do 3 
Oh ! the old folks say its folly, 
But to me young love is jolly, 
Or it was that night, " By Golly !" 
When I 
saw sweet Annie home. 
Ah ! the moon and stars shone brigTatly, 
As we tripped along so lightly, 
And I 
thought she trembled slightly, 
When I 
pressed my suit of love. 
But her heart seemed to grow lighter, 
And her eyes to sparkle brighter, 
While she held my arms much tighter, 
As Qnward we did rove. 
But a 
stream ran thro' the Forest, 
And straight across our way— 
Then my darling looked so modest, 
Without a 
word to say. 
In ray arms I 
did enfold her, 
And above the stream I 
told her, 
To my heart I'd love to hold her 
Forever and a 
day. 
Out in the Forest, &c. 
At length we reached her dwelling, 
And my heart with joy was swelling, 
So I 
kept on fondly telling 
How dear she was to me. 
And she blushed and smiled so sweetly, 
That she won my heart completely; 
But she answered me discreetly, 
Saying, dearly I 
love thee! 
Then I 
murrnued—friends may sever, 
And the roses lose their bloom ; 
But forget thee, I 
shall never, 
And I'll see you safely home. 
For I'll bui1d a 
little cottage, 
In a 
pleasant little village, 
Take her heart and hand in marriage, 
And I'll see sweet Annie home.

In the morning when we rise, we feel so gay 
That we both commence to dancing, right away, 
When the people underneath, 
They commence to grit th,ir teeth, 
But they hate to tell us fur— 
To g9 away. 
For they know that we are always full of Inn' 
If they try to catch us, ell we both do run. 
But well bid you all adieu,

Oil! here we are two Gallus•Nigs, 
As ever you did see ; 
We belong upon the Mississippi, 
Away down in Tennessee. 
Oh! we can dance, and we can sing, 
And twist our heel and toe ; 
So watch us closely while we dance, 
And something new we'll show. 
My brother here, his name is Bill, 
And his name it is not Jim, 
They say we are so much alike 
That you can't tell me from him; 
But I 
can see the difference, 
As we walk along the street, 
For all the folks, as we pass by, 
Say he's got the biggest feet. 
So now we've been here long enough, 
And off I 
guess we'll dance, 
For he has got to see his Lize, 
And him his black-eyed Nance; 
But the next time that we come along, 
To please you we will try, 
So farewell to you one and all, 
Well bid you all good-bye.

Banjo and bones and a 
tin plate on 
table. 
Enter Lawyer Jones. 
Jones.—llum! I 
have just come from down town with 
great news—great news! I 
shall be a 
rich man—_a very 
rich man ! 
These two little orphans that have been left 
in my charge have fallen heirs to an immense estate. 
What a wonderful surprise for them, the dear little 
darlings! I 
must go and hunt them up. 
Bob! 
Jenny! 
Where are you ? (
Exit calling). 
Enter Bob singing and dancing, 
Arn.z—" The Cure." 
0, I'm a 
gay and active boy, 
As lively as a 
bird, 
Pm always up to snuff you see, 
I 
am upon my word ; 
I 
sing, I 
dance, I 
play the deuce 
No matter what's to pay, 
I 
tell you all, to kill the blues, 
This is the only way. 
Enter Jenny singing and jumping 
The next time that I 
met her, 
'Twas out in Union Park, 
She was sitting on a 
seat eating sweets, 
And I 
tried this girl to spark, 
I 
told her that I 
loved her, 
And then she called me dear, 
I 
wasjust a 
going to give her a 
sweet little kiss 
Spoken.—When some one stepped up behind me with a 
club--
(Sung).— 
And struck me in the ear. 
Spoken.—I. turned around and saw it was the old man 
again. 
Ile had been watching. 
I 
said to him: 
My 
dear sir, out of Tespect for your beautiful daughter I 
am— 
(Chorus). 
She answered to me nixey, dear, 
When T 
asked her to be mine, 
I 
told her I 
would blow out my brains, 
If any I 
could find, 
She then repented and I've been married 
To her for more than a 
year. 
And I've a 
bouncing boy 
Who is my joy, and he'll be an auctioneer.

SOME men are so anxious for honor and, fame, 
They'll work for a 
lifetime in making a 
name, 
But too much of a 
name is a 
possible thing • 
As you'll say when you've heard what I'm going to sing! 
My father and mother were excellent folks, 
But both had a 
weakness for practical jokes 
So when I 
was born they were both of one mind, 
And said I 
should 1Qive all the names I 
could find. 
Cirours. 
Jonathan, Joseph, Jeremiah, 
Timothy, Titus, Obadiah, 
William, Henry, Walter, Sim, 
Reuben, Rufus, Solomon, Jim, 
Nathanial, Daniel, Abraham, 
Roderick, Frederick, Peter, Sam, 
Simon, Timon, Nicholas, Pat, 
Christopher, Dick. Jehosophat. 
I 
was to be christen'd before I 
could speak, 
Fo I 
couldn't object to this curious freak; 
There were two other youngsters that morning as well, 
But for these poor children it turned out a 
sell! 
When the Clergyman came I 
was first of the three, 
So, of course, he commenced operations on me 
And it took him so long al, my titles to call. 
The other two babies got no names at all. 
Jonathan, Joseph, Jeremiah, etc. 
When I 
went to be married the case was as bad, 
The Parson stared at me, and thought I 
was mad: 
However, he started, but found very soon 
The task was too great to get finished by noon; 
So he said " My dear sir, its a 
very great shame 
Your parents denied you a 
sensible name; 
But thro' this strange freak, Ns ithout reason or rhyme, 
You'll have to be married a 
bit at a 
time." 
Jonathan, Joseph, Jeremiah, etc. 
It appears that a 
gipsy, a 
year or two since, 
Told my wife that some day she would marry a 
prince, 
With a 
long roll of titles, and she would be bless'd 
With a 
boy for each name that her husband possess'd 
She often declares that the prophecy's right, 
But I 
am no prince so I 
don't see it quite, 
For if the last part of it ever comes true, 
I'm sure I 
don't know what on earth I 
shall do,

Dear Mother—thy children 
In one voice united, 
Pray blessings from Heaven 
Upon thee, delighted— 
With hope in the future, to 
Come of God's will ; 
Joys that hovered about you, 
To cling round you still. 
Fond parent—we love thee, 
For thou art so kind ; 
And it's ever of thee 
Crumbs of comfort we find. 
Sweet Angelic soother, 
The good deeds you've done 
Shall live after you. Mother— 
Live after you're gone. 
Thou sunbeam of gladness, 
Dear hope star, so bright ; 
That ever through sadness, 
Sent forth genial light ; 
And it comes with the memory 
Of thee Mother, dear ! 
Thus sweetening our reveries 
That clse were too drear. 
Of thy beauty in youth, I 
Could write a 
whole column, 
And goodness and truth, I 
Could write a

Thy future's o'ercast by 
A

THE SOLDIER OF ERIN, 
As sung by M OMAS TIARTIr. 
AIR: 
Exile of Ertn. 
THE shadows of darkness around him were falling, 
And eve's lonely star lit the wanderer's way, 
When the harp of the minstrel his footsteps recalling, 
The brave soldier paused at the heart moving lay, 
Oh, dear to my soul in tIm spring time of feeling, 
Ere the blight of the cold world had swept o'er its flowers, 
Was that strain of my childhood from tender lips stealing, 
In fair Conemara s 
now desolate bowers. 
4:1 
Sweet song of my boyhood, still deeper and deeper, 
It sinks on my heart, as I 
list to the strain, 
Like a 
dream of the dead, that steals o'er the sleeper, 
And brings back the lost and the loved ones again. 
Dear voice oi the past, like the lone harp of Tara, 
It wakes mid the ruins or all I 
deplore, 
Farewell to thy green Mils, my fair Conemara, 
First home of my heart I 
shall see thee no more. 
31 
REALY DON'T THINK I 
SHALL MARRY. 
COMEIisten to me, mid I'm sure you'll agree, 
'Tis a 
shame that I 
longer shall tarry. 
The beaux I 
can find, yet not one to my mind, 
So I 
really don't think I 
shall marry. 
There's Edward so gay, that he never can pay, 
Such attention to one girl in twenty, 
And then his long hair, such a 
fright I 
declare, 
If half otT, he would then have quite plenty. 
CHORUS. 
Come listen to me, and I'm sure you'll agree, 
'Tis a 
shame that I 
longer shall tarry, 
The beaux I 
can find, yet not one to ins' mind, 
So I 
really don't think I 
shall marry. 
There's Arthur now mind, who thinks he's refined, 
And says he speaks French like a 
native, 
But he turns in his toes, and wears very queer clothen g 
Tell stories and so imitative; 
Indeed the whole set me quite in a 
pet, 
I've no doubt, you'll all own I 
have reason, 
So leave just as these, to do just as they please, 
And wait till some are in good season. 
Come listen to me, &c.

The scene opens to full set parlors, with Bay window 
and door in fiats—lively music and symphony of song— 
" 
I 
Wonder Where is Tommy ?" [usi° is discovered dust-
ing the furniture, Sc., and at the end of symphony sings] 
I 
wonder where is Tommy now ? 
He was to come to- day. 
My Master's going to hire him 
And give him splendid pay. 
Sure, something is the matter, 
lie would not stay away. 
I 
have not seen his lovely face 
Since just a

DANCE. 
Susie dances two strains of music. 
At the end of firs: 
strain, Tommy appears at door with Umbrella and a 
paper 
Satchel, and walks towards Susie, and in time with the 
music—hits her with umbrella—she falls—but when she 
sees her dear Tommy, she is all smiles again, then Tommy 
Si — 
Oh ! Susie, here I 
is at last. 
'You know I 
said I 
would. 
But I'd a

Dat's if I 
only could. 
Yes, something was the matter, 
And I 
could .nt get away. 
I 
had to work so very hard, 
All this blessed day. 
Chorus as before. 
And first, Tommy dances—then Susie dances, and both 
dance together; and at the end of third dance, Susie (by 
mistake, of course), kicks her foot clean through the 
satchel in Tommy's hand. 
At this julicture music stors, 
Susie and Tommy hold the picture, and Mr. Dunlap ap-

Mr. D.—Susie what does this mean, " I

Mr. D.—No, sir ; you're just the lively sort of servant I 
want, and you can enter upon your duties at once. 
In the 
first place, let me inform you that my wife is afflicted with 
temporary insanity; that is, in short, she is crazy ; and 
the only thing to cure her is a 
servant, lively, like your-
self. 
You must humor her in all her changing moods and 
caprices ; sing, dance, or act, as she desires. 
She may 
knock you down with a 
chair or anything else ; but you 
mus'nt pay any attention to that. 
t...!he may kiss you in a 
loving way, and you must pay no attention to that, or 
anything, but humor her in everything, as we all do; and 
lay this flattering unction to your soul, that in case she 
kills you, you shall have the finest funeral that any of 
your kind ever had. 
And now, I 
will pay you five dollars 
a 
day until she is better; then if-you-are-alive, I 
will give 
you one thousand dollars as a 
present; and you shall live 
right here in the parlor. eat, drink and smoke, at your 
leisure. 
And now, sir, I 
shall send your sister up with 
your breakfast. [ Exit Mr. D.]

long—five dollars a

I 
gits right out. 
[Goes towards door in a 
hurry and bucks against Susie, 
who has a 
tray full of dishes—dishes and Tommy fall. 
Susie runs away round the stage and out the door, and 
Tommy follows, but is met at the door by Mrs. D, who's 
head is tied up with straw. 
With tragic step she enters, 
likewise does Tommy ref roat, and rims under tahle--she 
speaks]— 
Mrs. D —Come here, Princey. 
What a 
pretty little dog. 
Tomyrz.—Ah! She takes me for a

Mrs. D.—Then sing " You'll Remember Ye."

while. Susie in the rear joins in the chorus.] 
Mrs. D —[ At the en.. of song, about to exit, says] — Ta-
ta, Pet—farewell my sweet Prince. 
[Exit, I, E. R.] 
SusiE.—[Going up to Tommy, saying]—Now, dat set-

seed you a 
making love, and 
now, I'm going to tell Massa dat you ain't my brother, and 
he'll discharge you. 
Tom .—Never mind, Sue; I'm doing all this for you, 
and I 
can stand anything if you'll only say you low: me. 
[Tommy sings.] 
TELL ME TRULY.—Aut.--Drearning Eye.3-
Tell me, Susie, that you'll love me, 
In the coming, happy day; 
That you will not east me from thee,

Shall enshrine you, as my wife.

Tell me true! Tell me. Suo 
That you'll love me all your ; 
Tell me Sue—tell me truly, 
That you'll be my darling wife ? 
[Both dance a 
Jig. 
And at the end, Mrs. D. comes on

book. 
As she suddenly discovers 
Tommy and Susie dancing, she throws the book at Tom-

husband and Susie come in And help to kick Tommy, and

Tommy looks after them and imitates their laugh—then 
Susie comes back and goes to Tommy, whisperingly, and 
cays]—" gush, I

each exits 1, F. 11.. after that speech—then Mrs D. enters,

Mrs. D.—I

lommy sings Opera selection. 
Susie sits in chair on 
top at 
Mrs. D. beside table--Tommy wraps table 
cloth 
him and sings, thus]— 
Drink to me only with thine eyes, 
And 1 will drink to thee with mine ; 
Drink to me only with thine eyes,

Here, take the with, cup!

(Cuorius.—Repeat first 4 
lines.) 
[At the end of chorus Mrs. D grabs Tommy, pulls him 
near scenes—grabs Dummy and throws it out the window 
and then at that moment she recovers her senses, aria her 
husband comes in, and Mrs. D. says]— 
My dear husband—I 
am entirely better now; the dark 
cloud that so long enthralled my reason, has passed away, 
and I 
am once more sane. 
Mr. D.—Thank Heaven for this kind and merciful act. 
But, my darling, I am in great fear that you have killed 
poor Susie's brother. 
[Susie enters, crying.' 
Massa, he wits'ut my brother, he 
was my true love, and now I'm a 
widder. 
Mr. D.—Well, Susie, I promised him one thousand 
dollars when my wile got better, and if he was alive now. 
I'd give him two thousand. 
[Tommy enters through door.] 
Massa, please go and 
order my funeral, I'm dead. 
Mr. D.—No, you're not; and instead of one thousand, 
here are two. 
And now, you and Susie can go and get 
married, and have all the fun you like, right here in the 
Parlor. 
Tomnix—[Looking at Susie, says)—Susie, will you be 
my wife ? 
SustE.—" Now you stop !" 
(Tommy puts the money before her and repeats the 
question.] " I

SUSIE. —

[Symphony plays " Shell) Flew," (can be found on anoth-
er page,) and Tommy and Susie sing and dance it. ending 
with Grand Can- Gan, in which Mr. and Mrs. D. take part.' 
THE END. 
MY love is like a'bird,

My blessings on each manly son

While life remains within these veins, 
A

Like any thrush or starlin', 
In cage or tree, ray song should be,

DRIFTING DOWN THE CREEK. 
Written for TONY PASTOR, by FRANI: lil:MONT. 
ONCE again I 
claim attention, 
While I 
sing these several lines, 
And a 
motto I 
will mention, 
One of course to suit the times. 
Some folks we're ever meeting, 
Through the world they go on cheek, 
Yet we know in spite of smiling, 
They are drifting down the creek. 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
They are drifting down the creek. 
There's a 
friend who once had money, 
Now ' tis gone, he wants a 
lift, 
Make his days of darkness sunny, 
Never let him go adrift ; 
Even Grant, the nation's ruler, 
Distant cousins he will seek, 
" 
Dents ' and presents he will never, 
Send them drifting down the creek. 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
lie will nev„r send them down the creek. 
Politicians too are needing, 
To keep open wide their eyes, 
The people's voice they'll soon be hearing, 
That will crush their plots and lies, 
Congress with its shares of railroad, 
Mobilier stocks as presents seek, 
Colfax, Ames and all those fellows, 
Send them drifting down the creek ; 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
Send them sailing down the creek. 
In conclusion I 
will mention, 
Should any powers ever strive, 
To tread upon this Yankee nation. 
They'll find the " boys in blue" alive, 
With the mem'ry of our chieftain, 
George Washington of him I 
speak, 
Columbia rushes like a 
whirlwind, 
And seink them drifting down the creek. 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
Send them scattering down the creek.

OH McSwattagan had been working hard, 
Climbing ladders with the hod; 
But one hot day he thought he'd rest, 
So invited the friends he liked the best. 
A pic-nic party he did start, 
Refreshments he piled in a 
cart— 
He purchased whisky by the flask, 
And all the lads to drink did ask. 
Lots of fun they'd have no doubt, 
So McSwattagan's pie-the started out. 
Oh! Miss Biddy O'Doyle had new red hair, 
Which she had curled with greatest care; 
Mulcahy's father looked serene— 
For he wore a 
new cravat of green; 
McSwattagan he was dressed to death, 
lie had perfumed his hair and breath; 
He'd polished up his beaver hat 
By rubbing on it lard and fat; 
The ladies in their best did dress, 
And the pic-nic seemed a 
big success. 
Oh! at length they reached the country air, 
For dancing they did soon prepare; 
The fiddler he was full and blind, 
And his rosin and fiddle could'nt 
So McSwattagan had to hum a 
ttnic, 
...dance was started very soon; 
f 
he bottles were emptied one hy one, 
When Mulcahy's father spoilt the fun. 
He said he'd been insulted there, 
And for a 
ruction did prepare. 
Oh, Tim Doyle had said his cravat of green, 
k 
trifle smaller might have been, 
Then Mulcahy's face got very red, 
And he hit Pat Flynn across the head; 
Miss Doyle she lost her new red hair, 
McSwattagan he began to swear, 
McCarthy stepped upon his nose, 
And crushed the bunions on his toes, 
The fiddler was pulled out thro' his coat, 
And they jammed his fiddle down his throat. 
Bricks and stones began to fly, 
One hit McSwattagan in the eye, 
Policemen then did soon appear, 
And clubbed 3Iulcaby o'er the car. 
Miss Doyle into the crowd she flew, 
And tore McSwattagan's shirt in two, 
The crowd fell fainting in a 
heap, 
They could'nt walk they could -lit creep, 
Policemen piled them in a 
cart, 
And the pic-nic party home did start. 
Cuonus—(The next day ) 
'Twas the finest day they ever semi, 
..k pleasant tune it might have been; 
The,guests did say with one accord, 
That McSwattagan's pic-nic was a 
fraud. 
THERE was a 
naughty little boy, as naughty as could be, 
Who used to scream, and vex his Ma, and spill his daily tea , 
His leisure moments he'd employ regardless of her cries, 
In sticking pins and needles in his little, sister's eyes : 
He often used to lose himself, and gave his parents pain.— 
By turning up his little nose, when he timed up again
ii  ; 
kicked his mother's poodle and then out of window threw 
him, 
And bit his little brother so, that people hardly knew him 
Ile used to smash his pretty toys, his Noah's Ark likewise, 
Where Elephants and Beetles were exactly of a 
size ; 
He amputated Japhet's arms, and cut of Noah's feet, 
Persisting as he swallow'd him— that ham was good to eat : 
lie never once repented, though his gentle parents frown'd, 
But took a 
holiday from school, to see the kittens drown'd ; 
In hiding Fido's meat he seem'd to take an honest pride, 
And teased the cat so much, that she committed suicide. 
He never shed a 
single tear o'er Pussy's mournful fate, 
But called his nurse a 
naughty name, and went to bed at eight; 
He put the candle out, and with the last expiring spark, 
He thought he saw two eyes that glared and glistened in t1.3 
dark; 
He thought he saw a 
mewing, and he thought he heard a 
head, 
That would have been liko Pussy's only she was cold and dead. 
Tho' dreadful eyes drew nearer—oh, most terrible of sights— 
He screamed aloud—the cat! the cat! and then they brought 
the lights. 
They look'd about all•ia and out, but nothing could they see, 
That threw a 
light upon the cause of this catastrophee; 
Until the morning came, when nurse with dreadful horror saw, 
Each nail had grown a 
talon, and each little hand a 
paw; 
He took to catching mice, and even rats he'd not refuse, 
Was seized with cataleptic tits, and hung about the mews, 
And thinking he had got nine lives, he played at Pool all day, 
And joined the hippo-phalogical society, they say. 
He took to hating pastry, and he grew quite sick o' tart, 
Sat musing at the wiudow, till he heard the cat's-meat cart; 
his parents tried to win him back, with coaxes and with smiles, 
But he wouldn't own a 
feather bed's superior to tiles; 
I 
don't know what became of him, 
and what's more do not 
care, 
For naughty little boys like that, I 
never could a-bear,— 
Be kind to cats and kittens is the moral I 
would tell, 
And send a 
friend to see ' em drowned, and that'll do as welL

So many lights we see, •

Ah! muffle the harp— touch not a

Lest thou disturb her slumber sound— 
Who : leep the everlasting sleep ; one word 
Would mar the holiness, profound ! 
Poor Anestaeia lies silently there, 
Bene.ith that little new made mound. 
Not her— but all that's left of her ; 
IL,r soul, sweet Heaven has now enthron'd 
•• Dear mourners"—pray list to the story, 
Of an earthly Angelic flight. 
Who vanished away in the glory 
Of Heaven's most radiant light! 
How, for years she had dwelt among us; 
And we learned to love her so. 
But she left her soul's cold raiment 
To be buried beneath the snow. 
Anestacia. We knew her an Orphan, 
So fair, so pure and so mild ; 
And the cares of nineteen summers, 
Still left her but a 
child. 
Ethereal— sweet—Angelic! 
So tender, benign and good ; 
'With something divine about her,

When I 
saw the sad expression 
Her black eyes used to wear, 
It made me think of Heaven, 
And sometimes say a 
prayer; 
he seemed not ill, nor healthy— 
Not joyous, and yet content ; 
Like a 
fair but drooping lily, 
When its bloom is nearly spent 
We loved her in our household, 
And hoped she'd always stay. 
But one bright summer morning, 
It seemed she flew away. 
Then we heard of how an Angel 
Took flight to God above. 
How she passed in perfect glory, 
To realms of bliss and love. 
She looked so fair in the coffin, 
With a 
smile so sweet and bland; 
Her beauty far outrivaled 
The lilies in her hand. 
Her dear friends gathered round her, 
And tears of sorrow fell ; 
And prayers were sent to Heaven, 
Where she with God cloth dwell 
DEAR FRIENDS OF LONG AGO. 
They had been boys together, 
Some fifteen years ago; 
Were fond of one another, 
Good friends, in weal or woe. 
but the iron hand of destiny • 
tivided them, and so 
lo- day they meet as strangers, 
Dear Ilion& of long ago, 
Dame fortune met the lucky one— 
Smiled on him—gave her store; 
But shunned the bold and plucky one, 
Who sailed the ocean o'er ; 
The riches that came to him 
Was not his, alas! ah, no! 
Ile risked—lost—and losing, lost 
Dear friends of long ago. 
In the Park of a 
noble City, 
Struts a 
lordly millionaire ; 
And his heart i8 moved to pity 
For another strolling ther3. 
It is morning, and the lucky one 
Is out to catch the air, 
While the sad, impoverished, plucky oue, 
heelis work and daily fara. 
Good morning, lord and master! 
Said the poor man, bending low, 
I 
urn hungry, and would work, sir, 
If I 
had the work to do. 
I 
have worked my passage over 
From cold England's selfish shore, 
And I'm looking for my friends, sir, 
For the f.iends I 
knew before. 
What is your name ? " Tom Roland," Sir. 
" 
Tom Roland, here's my hand, 
And all of John Day's fortune, sir, 
Is now at your command." 
" 
Why bless your heart! you're wealthy, Torn, 
Your Uncle—now laid low— 
Willed all his wealth to you, Tom— 
Dear friend of long ago." 
" 
You remember Alice Brown, Tom, 
'She lives, and loves you still; 
Come, shake hands with her brother Tom," 
Bill Brown—you bet I 
will." 
And I 
was out for an appetite, Tom, 
For my breakfast." " Yes, I 
know, 
And I 
was after a 
breakfast, Bill—

MY 
name's Tommy Thomas, I 
live on a 
farm; 
I've a 
sweetheart by name Huidy Ann; 
Her father's a 
neighbor of daddy's, 
And so I 
go there whotiever I 
can. 
The first time I 
set foot or, her father's step, 
I 
didn't dare go a 
step farther 
Until she came out and said " Tommy, come in

wanted to say— 
". Huldy Ann, how is your mother?" . 
Says she, " quite a 
fine eve'nin'; come over afoot ?'' 
Says I. ‘• no, Miss, I 
rode on Old Dapple." 
Then I 
went, sat beside her, but soon she arose 
And brought out the cider and apples, 
Then went on with her work while I 
sa there and looked 
First at one foot and then at the othr,r; 
But when I 
tried talking, all I 
could say 
Was " fluldy Ann, how is your mother?" 
Huldy Ann Flankinson, etc. 
I 
thought I 
now is my chance; for a 
kiss I 
will ask, 
Though with blushes my cheek:: seemed to burn 
But she turned up her nose when I 
made my appeal, 
And went on a 'peelin' a 
turnip. 
" 
Then I'll take one,' says I. 
Oh, no you won't, Mister 
If you dare to, I'll call my big br)therl" 
She didn't look like she meant it, so I 
gave her a 
buss. 
Says she, " hush, or you'll wake up my mother:" 
Ciwars. 
And ever since then I've been feelin' so good 
That it makes all our folks lots of bother 
Whatever they ask me, I 
only reply—

For one who wili come in the darkness, 
And pray fcr the first gleam of light;

Keep watch by the window or door, 
As over the hill I

For no one speaks kind to the poor. 
T. know you are waiting, dear Mother, 
And wishing the shadows would flee, 
The fire has gone out in the cottage, 
The light shines but dimly for me; 
But do not forget in your sadness, 
My affection so constant and pure, . 
And greet mo with smiles at my coming, 
For nobody cares for the poor. 
Then wait for my coming, etc. 
Oh, there will be joy in our cottage, 
When sunshine is geming the sky, 
When gloom of life's evening has vanished, 
And calm, tranquil light smiles on high; 
For God will assist us, dear Mother, 
The trials of life to endure, 
And lighten the heart faint find weary, 
When nobody cares for the poor.

They say 'tis true, the news from Spain, 
Of how " our people" have been slain, 
Were held up and shot down like rain, 
By Spaniards, over there; 
Who treat our Consuls with disdain, 
And say they have no fear. 
Columbia's blood—Columbia's brains— 
Are scattered wide upon their plains ; 
And guiltless gore their water stains— 
The fiends that do and dare. 
Because we are Americans, 
Ilow—" Uncle Sam"—can you look on 
And sae such deeds of horror done, 
To Father, Mothez, Brother and Son, 
And Daughters outraged there— 
Without the echo of one gun— 
As if you had no care ? 
Say—" Uncle Sam"—are you too old, 
Or has your honor's fire grown cold? 
Is there no Eagle-topped banner, bold, 
To wave with pride on high, 
While Sons are eager to take hold, 
the war-ery--eall your blelt. 
And let our Eagle scream again 
Wave high our banners on land and main, 
And to the front repair! 
Avenge thy Sons so cruelly slain-
Too much for us to bear. 
Come—let us end this bloody muss, 
And those who brought about the fuss--
Who sank our Ship Virginius"— 
To cast indignant slurs at us, 
And we can so well war!

friend to assist you, 
He'll say that his money's play'd 
But when he was down, you to help him, 
Put your hand in your pocket, no doubt. 
But this world it is cruel and cold, boys, 
Though good times may come by and by; 
Your best friend you keep in your pocket, 
And don't fly your kite up too high. 
Then don't fly, etc.

When your out keep your friend in your pocket,

George Barnwell, TIIE M ERCEUNT's CLETtlt — This is an 
extremely sensational sketch, but shows Truth stranger than Fiction. 
This deluded victim went from crime to crime with a 
fearful rapidity, 
urged by the baneful influences of women lost to honor. He realized 
every moment the evils of his course, but, like a 
bird fluttering over the 
basilisk eye of the serpent, he went, down, down. Into the vortex of ruin 
and despair.

of resisting that temptation. which comes arrayed like an " angel of 
light"—beautiful to the eye, and blasting' to the soul.... Price 25 Cents,

silty for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary sp. 
pearance of a

bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting the leaven 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one oicture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
suecession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit; the next only Columbine, thee 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or klephistophiles. A
