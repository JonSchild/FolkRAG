The Green Fields of Virginia'Mid the green fields of Virginia,In the [V ale?] of Shennandoah,Stands
an ivy covered homestead that I love,With its quaint old-fashioned chimneysAnd its simple homelike
air;'Twas the home of my dear parents, now above.There's a simple cottage there,And a mother
loved so dear , How ny heart is pining for it day by day , Where we spent life's golden hours,In the
[V ale?] of Shennendoah,'Mid the green fields of Virginia far away.Though I'm dwelling in a mansion
grand,With wealth at my command,I'd give it all for just one single day,Just to play with my young
comrades,And see my mother dear,In the green fields of Virginia, far away.There's a simple cottage
there,And a mother loved so dear,How my heart is pining for it-day by day,Where we spent life's
golden hours,In the Vale of Shennendoah,'Mid the green fields of Virginia far away.'Mid the green
fields of Virginia,Stands an old mill by the stream,When a boy I loved to sing and play.And how
often would I throwThe stones into the babbling brook,And I dreamed one day t'would carry me
away.There's a simple cottage there,And a mother loved so dear,How my heart is pining for it day by
day,Where we spent life's golden hours,In the Vale of Shennendoah,'Mid the green fields of Virginia
far away. 2 2 of 2The Green Fields of VirginiaThat dream came true one day in June;I left that dear
old spot.How my dear old mother's heart did break that day!Oh! If I could but see her faceAnd
lay me down and die'Mid the green fields of Virginia far away.There's a simple cottage there,And
a mother loved so dear,How my heart is pining for it (defective from here on) 7E-A2 THE GREEN
