MULDOON, THE SOLID MAN. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. H. H ARDING, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Written and sung by ED. H ARRIGAN in his popular sketch of" Who owns 
the Clothes Line ? " 
I 
Au a 
man of great influence, 
And educated to a 
high degree, 
I 
came here when small from Donegal, 
In the Daniel Webster, across the sea; 
In the Fourteenth Ward I 
situated, 
In a 
tenement house with my brother Dan ; 
By perseverance I 
elevated, 
And went to the front like a 
solid man. 
CHORUS. 
Go with me and I'll treat you dacent; 
Pll set you down, and I'll fill the can ; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet. 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a 
solid man." 
At any party or any raffle 
I 
always go as an invited guest; 
As conspicuous as General Granite, boys, 
I 
wear a 
rosebud upon my breast; 
Pm call'd upon to address the meeting, 
Without regard to clique or clan 
I 
show the constitution with elocution, 
Bekase you know I'm a 
solid man. 
CHORUS. 
For oppositions or politicians, 
Take my word I 
don't give a 
damn; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a 
solid man." 
I 
control the Tombs, I 
control the Island, 
My constituents they all go there, 
To enjoy the summer's recreation, 
And the refreshing East river air; 
I'm known in Harlem, I'm known in .Jarsey, 
I'm welcomed hearty on every hand; 
Wid my regalia on Patrick's day, 
I 
march away like a 
solid man. 
For oppositions, etc.

THE MULLIGAN GUARD. 
By kind permission of llAuitioAN and HART. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1873, by N ED HARRIGAN, 
in the Office of the Librarian of tongress, at N\ ashington, D. C. 
Composed and sung by HARRIGAN and H ART, with imnlense success, at the 
Theatre Lomique, New York. 
WE 
crave your condescension, 
And we'll tell you what we know 
Of marching in the Mulligan Guards 
From the seventh ward below; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey— 
A 
Tipperary man— 
Ile carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
CHORIJS. 
We shouldered guns, 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the Connemarro pet, 
With the rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red, boys, 
To show where we came from ; 
Our guns we'd lift, 
With the right shoulder shift, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We shouldered, etc. 
When we'd get home at night, boys, 
The divil a 
wink we'd sleep ; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of whiskey, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
And march in the Mulligan Guard. 
We shouldered, etc. 
GOOSE AND INGI7NS, 
Oh, dear, I'm nearly starving, 
I 
want something nice to el. 
I 
fancy myself carving, 
Big pies and joints of meat. 
Roast pork or leg of mutton, 
To me would be of use; 
And though I'm not a 
glutton, 
Still, l'd polish off a 
goose 
CHOLUS. 
For it is my opinion, 
That stuffed with sage and ingun, 
No bird that flies is half so nice. 
As a 
Goose with sage and ingun. 
I'm very fond of Turkey, 
Spring Chicken is good to take; 
Of Partridge or of Pheasant, 
A 
dinner I 
could make. 
I 
like corned beef and mustard, 
Or sirloin steak with juice, 
Or Prairie hen or Bustard fat, 
But most I 
love a 
Goose 
For it is rny opinion, &a 
I've liver tried and bacon, 
And tripe both boiled and fried; 
A 
sheep's-he.ad I 
have taken. 
And put myself outside. 
Though turtle soup is filling. 
And fish-balls joy produce; 
'Tis not the rapture or the joy, 
That appertains to Goose! 
For it is my opinion, & e. 
6 
I SHOULD L TICTI TO. 
As sung with great applause by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
ALL kinds of fun and frolic too, I 
meet with night and day, 
And yet from all of it I 
have to tear myself away ; 
The girls again I 
always meet, are something sweet I 
vow, 
Oh, couldn't I 
enjoy myself if I 
were single now. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, now I'm married and settled, I 
come across no 
end of chances for real enjoyment. 
When I 
was single things 
were as dull as ditch water. 
It's cruel to be tantalized in this 
manner now a 
fellow's running in double harness, and when I 
see my old single members going out for a 
regular break down, 
that's the time when I 
feel as though-,-
CHORUS. 
I should like to, I 
should like to, and sorry I 
am to say shan't, 
But the fact is, yes, the fact is, I'm married alas, and I 
can't. 
Some friends of mine they called on me, ' tis just a 
week ago, 
And with them on a 
trip at once, they said that I 
must go; 
Of course they all seemed greatly vexed, and savage quite to find 
That I 
could not their frolic share, but had to stay behind. 
SPOKEN.—They said, " This won't do, old fellow, you must 
come, for we're going to have a 
genuine flare-up and no mis-
take." " I'm very sorry, my dear boys," was my gloomy re-
ply, " but it really can't be managed—she's in the next room— 
but of course I 
should wish you thoroughly to understand, 
that "— 
I 
should like to, etc. 
One night last week I 
overtook a 
lady tall and fair, 
Oh! hazel were her beaming eyes, and golden was her hair, 
This fair one I 
a 
little while in doubt and silence eyed, 
But soon we both together got, and walked on side by side. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, this dear little creature and I 
soon got on 
very good terms, and at last she said—" Won't you take me to 
the theatre ?" " Eh? Ah," said I—" I'm grieved to observe 
that you're asking an impossibility, I am utterly powerless to 
manage it, though I 
really can assure you that "— 
I 
should like to, etc. 
But now I 
must conclude my song and toddle off with speed, 
Or otherwise I 
feel convinced there'll be a 
row indeed, 
For Mary Jane, my vixen wife, is waiting close at hand, 
And rows with her, I 
do declare, are more than I 
can stand. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, ladies, I 
must now bid you adieu; I 
trust you 
will not ask me to sing again, as my wife is so awfully jealous, 
although, as far as I'm personally concerned, you know— 
CHORUS. 
I 
should like to, I 
should like to, and sorry I 
am to say shan•t 
But the fact, oh, the fact is, I 
hear my wife coming and can't. 
FUNNY OLD GAL. 
As sung by Everybody. 
I'm a 
funny old gal and I 
take things cool, 
The people all say that I'm an old fool, 
But they may all laugh and chaff at my pate, 
Pm a 
fumy old gal from old Ca'lina State. 
CHORUS. 
Then all of you sing for this funny old gal, 
All of you sing for this funny old gal, 
All of you sing and don't you be too late, 
For this funny old gal from South Ca'lina State.' 
T'other day, while walking in the street, 
Some naughty little boy say, " how's your poor feet r, 
hit him with my cane, and then we had a 
tussle, 
And I 
found all the sawdust coming out of my bustle. 
Then all of you sing, etc. 
Oh! I've been married many a 
time, 
Of husbands I 
have had just nine; 
I 
always done my best for my husbands, don't you see, 
Bnt none of them ever done much for me. 
Then all of you sing, etc.

MY SUGAR PLUM. 
Words and Music by Tut:taus M . 
H ENGI.Rit. 
I 
atn over head and ears in love, 
The truth I 
tell, with a 
turtle dove ; 
She ought to be in the skies above, 
An angel she should be. 
Her laughing eyes, with a 
dimpled chin, 
Her face so white and fair : 
Her looks so neat and so complete, 
With a 
mass of silk like-hair—oh 
CHORUS. 
Prettily she dances on her little toes, 
Looks as neat and sweet as a 
little tube rose; 
Charms all the people as up the street she goes, 
She's my sugar plum. 
This luscious little sugar plum. 
Was introduced to the one you see. 
At a 
masked ball, where I 
had such fun, 
Everyone was in fun glee ; 
This joyous night my heart felt light. 
With gleams of future bliss— 
When parting at the dawn of day, 
I 
was rapt in happiness—oil 
CHORUS. 
Prettily she dances on her little toes, 
Looks as neat and sweet as a 
little tube rose; 
Charms all the people as up the street she goes, 
She's my sugar plum.

COMING HOME FROM THE BALL. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. H. HammNo, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. HIRDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
THERE is no place so gay as the ball- room, 
When we are dancing in dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never greet us 
In the flash of the beautiful night ; 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasures we dearly adore, 
We must part from the scene so enchanting, 
And go home looking sleepy and sore. 
CIIORUS. 
Oh, it's all very well to be waltzing, 
And the pleasures we love to recall, 
But you know how you feel in the morning, 
Corning home, coming home from the ball. 
There the ladies are rivals of Venus, 
And their smiles all around us do bestow, 
Every face wears a 
mantle of gladness, 
There is welcome wherever we go; 
But when morn comes around, we are weary, 
And we growl at the pain in our beads, 
And we think we are foolish for dancing 
When we should have been home in our bects. 
Oh, it's all, etc. 
All around us the music is floating, 
Light and gay as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
And we heed not the hours as they fly, 
Till the light peeping in through the window 
Makes us all bid each other good-bye. 
Oh, it's all, etc.

TILE uriLTRAs.Y 1/1010E. 
Banjo Solo. 
Ant.—" Rose of Texas." 
I 
WAS once a 
gallus nigger, 
And used to cut a 
dash, 
But now-a- days am glad to get 
Some boarding-house hash. 
Once I'd plenty money, 
Now I 
am dead broke; 
And everything that 1 
have had, 
Has gone up to soak. 
My watch, clothes and everything 
Is laid up on the shelf; 
But what's the use of talking, 
You know how it is yourself. 
So now I'm going to leave you, 
To get a 
glass of beer, 
And if the man asks me for stamps, 
Why, I'll slide off on my ear. 
CURLY-HEADED JOE. 
Am.—" Dry Dock Sal." 
Banjo Solo. 
OH, there was a 
young chap not very long ago, 
In this city of high renown; 
The first two letters of his name was curly-headed Joe, 
And he sold hot chestnuts brown, brown, brown, 
And he sold hot chestnuts brown. 
He bad a 
peanut roaster also on his stand, 
Of which he was chief engineer; 
And there he would sit all day and warm his hands, 
In the freezing, sneezing time of the year, year, year, 
In the freezing, sneezing time of the year. 
Now he loved a 
gal named swivel- eyed Sal. 
But she loved another feller better ; 
So this chestnut man resolved on su-i-cide, 
When he discovered that he never could get her, get her, get 
her, 
When he discovered that he never could get her. 
So he put a

mont Street, Boston. 
Price 35 cents. 
Little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Just once more before I 
go, 
Tell me truly, will you miss me, 
As I 
wonder to and fro ? 
Let me feel the tender pressing 
Of your ruby lips to mine, 
With your dimp e 
hands caressing. 
And your snowy arms entwine. 
CHORUS. 
86 Tro• 
Ah, little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Come and whisper sweet and low ! 
That your heart will sadly miss me, 
As I 
wander to and fro. 
Little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
We may never meet again! 
We may never roam together 
Down the dear old shady lane! 
Future years may bring us sorrow, 
That our hearts but little know, 
Still of care we should not borrow ; 
Come and kiss me ere I 
go. 
Ah, little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Come and whisper sweet and low ! 
That your heart will sadly miss me, 
As I 
wander to and fro.

The first time I 
met Charlie, 
'Twas down at Aldershot, 
There was to be a 
grand Review, 
So a 
holiday I 
had got; 
And how the ladies stared at him, 
For he looked so very grand, 
As he stepped right and left 
To Godfrey's charming band. 
Cho.—Oh, Charlie, dm 
He took me down to Brighton, 
As a 
furlough he had got, 
We really should enjoyed ourselves, 
But the sun was burning hot. 
And Charlie thought he'd like a 
bath, 
While I 
the town went round— 
They had to drag poor Charlie out, 
For he very near got drowned. 
Spoken.—Yes, the foolish fellow, to go in the Niater as he did, 
when he knew he couldn't swim, though he told me that he could 
swim like a 
chunk of wood; but it was nearly all up with him. 
Oh, if he had been drowned, it would have broken my heart, for 
I'm so fond of— 
Cho.—Oh, Charlie, he. 
He's going to have a 
fortune 
From his rich old uncle Downs; 
But he wished me to oblige him, 
With the loan of a 
few pounds. 
And then he says he'll marry me, 
For he's making preparations, 
And the wedding's going to take place 
At one of his rich relations. 
Cho.—Oh, Charlie, &e.

BEAUTIFUL LOVE. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
LOVE, love, oh, what is love 7 
love, 'tis that makes man feel so 
peculiar: 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud, a Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia 7 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round and 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the first attack it's like raspberry jam, running 
down ones back. 
ClIORITS. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, love it is that makes a 
man feel so pecu 
liar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man's but a 
fool when he falls in love. 
Oh, love, when you're in love, to presents, to parties and picnics 
you treat her, 
Oh, love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel just as tho' you'd 
like to eat her ; 
But the best of loves must part—then an end comes to you,. 
bliss, 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the 
parting kiss, 
You bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
Oh, love, etc. 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning yourself 
in cold water; 
If it's all right she'll giggle and say, please ask father if I 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, etc. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked- for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beautiful twins. 
Oh iovP, Pte. 
THREE CHEERS FOR AN IRISH STEW, 
AIR—" The Red, White and Blue." 
Some like red herrings fresh from the ocean, 
Others doat on a 
bit of pigs-fry, 
Some like ox- cheek I've a 
notion, 
Others live upon puddings and pie. 
In the soup-shops thousands assemble, 
And feed off a 
soup made of glue, 
But to me there's nothing resembles, 
A rale ould Irish stew. 
CHORUS. 
So good luck to an Irish stew, 
Three cheers for an Irish stews 
To me there's nothing resembles, 
A 
rale ould Irish stew ! 
When the tater blight spread desolation, 
And threatened the stew to deform, 
Old Nick too threatened the nation, 
But he couldn't ride through the storm. 
For our soldiers and sailors already, 
To blazes his strong torts have blew 
For the thing to keep good man ready 
Is a 
good mess of Irish stew. 
So good luck to an Irish stew, 
Long life to an Irish stew, 
For a 
mess for all tars in all weathers 
Is a 
good ould Irish stew. 
Then the stew. boys, the stew, boys, bring hither, 
And feast till you're up to the brim, 
May the stew of St. Patrick ne'er wither, 
Nor the name. of a 
Murphy grow dim ; 
May the spud and the union neer sever, 
When with good meat its brought up to view, 
May the nation and the people get ever, 
A good mild Irish stew. 
Then three cheers for an Irish st ew, 
Good luck to an Irish stew, 
May the Army and Navy get ever 
A rale ould Irish stew.

"HE IS THE MAN FOR MEW? 
Written and composed by G. W. Hruvr. 
I 
SING "Hurrah for our hearts of oak," 
And " Hurrah for the open sea," 
" 
Hurrah for our gallant sailors " too, 
Wherever they may be. 
Hurrah for our army, shout hurrah ! 
And our valiant volunteers, 
Hurrah for the men who thrash the foe, 
Whenever he appears. 
CHORUS. 
For they are the men for me, my boys, 
They are the men for me; 
God save our land and bless the tried and true, 
For they are the men for me. 
Hurrah for the man with a 
dollar a 
day, 
And hurrah for the man with two, 
Hurrah for the man with a 
thousand a 
year, 
And who's got no work to do. 
Hurrah for the man with five hundred thousand skads, 
Whoever he may be, 
And hurrah for that man, if he makes his will, 
And leaves it all to me. 
CHORUS. 
Then he is the man for me, my boys, 
lie is the man for me, 
If he left me ev'ry dollar, I'd ne'er be out of collar, 
So he'd be the man for me. 
Hurrah for the coon who never feels queer 
When he goes upon the sea, 
Eurrah for the party wich a 
heap of poor relatiobs, 
But who never a 
one does see ; 
Hurrah for the henpeckfi husband, who 
Don't wish he'd single tarried, 
And hurrah, hurrah, for the jolly old maid, 
Who doesn't \Nish she'd been married.

" 
HE IS THE MAN FOR ME."—Continued. 
CHORUS. 
For she's the old maid for me, my boys, 
That's the old maid for me, 
Who don't want man to cheer her, or to come a 
little nearer, 
Then, that's the old maid for me. 
Hurrah for the man who never kick' d 
A " poor unlucky wight" when he is down; 
Hurrah for the man with a 
cheerful heart, 
Who hasn't got " a 
cheerful ' brown,'" 
Hurrah for the man who never backs 
A 
horse but what he wins, 
And hurrah, hurrah for the " honest working man," 
Who's the father of a 
half a 
dozen twins. 
CHORUS. 
For he's the man for me, my boys, 
lie's the man for me; 
The friend of emigration and a 
surplus population, 
So he's the man for me. 
Hurrah for the wife who has always a 
smile, 
And who is not always wanting a 
new bonnet, 
Hurrah for the man with a 
jovial face, 
And a 
jolly good nose upon it; 
Hurrah, hurrah I 
for the dear, dear girls, 
May their charms be never less, 
And hurrah for the man who lends a 
helping baud 
To another in distress. 
CHORUS. 
For he's the man for me, my boys, 
He is the man for me, 
And if you like this lay, then I 
am bound to say, 
That you are the men for me.

STROLLING ON THE SANDS. 
Of course we all know Ramsgate well, 
That spot to thousands dear, 
Where dashing belles and heavy swells, 
Assemble Wry year: 
Some like to roam along the Pier, 
And view what that commands, 
But my delight, from morn till night, 
Is strolling on the sands. 
CFIORUs. 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
Watching all the bathers dip, list'ning to the band; 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
In cool or heat there's nought to beat a 
stroll upon the sands. 
I'll ne'er forget last summer-time, 
I 
spent a 
fortnight there, 
And made the sweet acquaintance of 
A lovely lady fair, 
She'd gone to bathe at Dunipton Gap, 
But, oh! the naughty queau, 
For once she thought she'd do without 
That vile bathing machine. 
She placed her clothes upon the beach. 
Then in the water played. 
But when she tried to come on shore. 
Oh! wasn't she dismayed; 
The tide had turn'd, and all her clothes 
Were floating out to sea, 
She'd nothing but her bathing dress— 
In what a 
plight to be. 
I 
fetch'd her mother to her aid, 
And saved all further strife, 
The maiden said, " this great event 
I'll think of all my life." 
We soon became the best of friends 
For all enjoy'd the fun; 
We're lovers now—and soon we two 
Are going to be one.

Deep in my soul I 
cherish 
While life remains 
Within these veins,

If it was a

That I 
could sing 
Like any thrush or starlin 
In cage or tree, 
My song should be:

TILE OLD HAT. 
Written and Composed by N

Am.—" Going to Mass last Sunday." 
My name is MeNamarra. 
I'm an American cit-i-zan; 
I'm proud you know, 
Wherever I 
go, 
I'm a 
true born Irishman : 
There's one thing, me boys, I'd have you 
And I've come to tell ye that, 
It's the seventeenth of March, 
'Whin, as stiff as starch, 
I 
parade with my old hat. 
CHORLTS. 
For it's down Broadway I 
march so gay, 
Wid Cornelius, Barney and Pat— 
The people shout whin I 
turn out, 
And parade with my old hat. 
That hat was made in Dublin, 
in the year of ninety-eight; 
'Twas never called in and ye can't begin 
To say it's out of date. 
It's travelled the wide world over, 
From Ireland to Bombay, 
And the only time it can be seen 
Is on St. Patrick's day. 
For it's down. etc. 
Thin give three cheers for the hat I

Before it is too late, 
And nine more cheers for Patrick's day, 
The day we celebrate.

I'll raise me hat to ye, 
I'll invite ye all to come and call, 
And join my company. 
For it's down, ete.

BEAUTIFUL GIRLS. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
THEY talk about their foreign girls, 
How beautiful they are, 
And how they dress, and all that thing, 
But for that I 
don't care; 
The girls I 
love are Yankee girls; 
I 
see them every day; 
They're plain, I 
own, but then they have 
A 
nice and winning way. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, indeed. I 
needn't go out of the United States 
know, 
to find— 
Cnoacs.—Beautiful girls, beautiful girls, 
Saucy, teasing, pleasing girls ; 
I 
love one and all, both great and small, 
Beautiful, beautiful girls. 
It's nice, when it is winter time, 
To go upon the road 
In a 
nice sleigh, a 
pretty girl 
'Long side of you is stowed; 
And how the people they will look, 
And wonder who she is; 
But you drive on, and never mind, 
Because it's not their " biz." 
SPOKEN.— It's the nicest thing in winter to have a 
pretty girl 
out sleighing. 
You stop at a 
hotel, and ask her what she will 
have to drink. 
She says ( very meekly), " Wine." " What 
kind— port or sherry 
She says, " Champagne." 
Now, im-
agine treating to champagne and only a 
dollar in you pocket— 
and that always happens when you take out riding— 
Beautiful girls, etc. 
And when the summer comes around, 
To plc- flies you do go, 
And to enjoy yourself, while there, 
You ask along your beau. 
The day is fine, the music, too, 
And birds sing from each tree, 
And with a 
charming, nice young girl, 
How happy one must be! 
SPOKEN.—At 
a 
pie-nic a 
man can always enjoy himself, if he 
has a 
pretty girl with him. 
How nice it is to eat lunch with 
her that she has prepared with her delicate hands ! 
How nice 
it is to get into a 
swill(' with her, and then to wander off in the 
woods alone! 
You get on your knees, and tell her you will 
lore her as long as life lasts, and ask her to be your wife. 
She 
consents. 
You then get up, and find a 
lot of mud and oyster-
shells all over your knees; and all that comes Nona making 
love to— 
Beautiful girls, etc.

THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH. 
Words by II. 
W . 
LONGFELLOW. 
Music by \V. II. WEIss. 
Under a 
spre ding chestnut trce 
The village smithy stands: 
The smith, a 
mighty man is he, 
With large and sinewy hands, 
And the muscles of his brawny arms 
Are strong as iron bands. 
His hair is crisp, and black and long; 
His face is like the tan; 
His brow is wet with hone t 
sweat, 
He earns whate'e he can, 
And looks the whole world in the face, 
For he owes not any man. 
Week in, week out, from morn till n 
ght, 
You can hear his bel OWS b!o ; 
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge, 
With m asured beat and slow, 
Like a 
sexton ringing the village bell 
When evening sun is low. 
And children coining home from school 
Look in at the open door— 
They love to see the flaming forge 
And hear the bellows roar, 
And catch the sparks that fly 
Like chaff from from a 
threshing floor. 
Be goes on Sundly to the church, 
And s ts amongst his boys ; 
Be hears the parson pray and preach; 
He hears his daughter's voice 
Singing in the village choir, 
And it makes his heart rejoice ; 
It sounds to him like her mother's voice 
Singing in Paradise; 
He needs must think of her o 
cc more, 
How in the grave she lies, 
And with h 
s ' ard r 
ugh hand he wil;es 
A 
tear from out his eyes. 
Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing, 
Onward through life he goes: 
Each morning secs some task begun, 
Each evening se 
it. 
close; 
Something attempted, sernething &re, 
Has earned a 
night's repose. 
Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy fr once; 
For the lesson thou hast aught; 
Thus at the flaming forge of life, 
Our fortunes must be wrought; 
Thus, on its sounding anvil shaped 
Each burning deed each th , tight. 
ItCOLLY, I CAN'T SAY YOU'RE HONEST. 
Oh, Molly, I 
can't say you're honest, 
You've stolen the heart from my breast; 
feel like a 
bird that's astonished 
When young vagabonds rob its nest. 
My brightest of sunshine at night is, 
Just between midnight and dawn; 
And then, Molly, dear my delight is, 
To sing you my little " crunawn." 
CHORUS. 
Winastru fillidoo, but I'm kilt: may the quilt 
Lie light on your beautiful form 
When the weather 'tis hot, but my love when 'tis not 
May it rowl ye up cosy and warm, filaloo. 
I 
-know that your father is stingy, 
And likewise your mother the same; 
And it's very small change I 
will bring you, 
Excepting the change of your name. 
So make haste with the change, dearest Molly, 
Be that same, more or less as it may, 
And my own name I'll give you, my darling, 
The minute that you name the day. 
Winastru fillaloo, (to. 
Oh, if you are sleeping, dear Molly, 
Don't let me waken you, dear; 
Some tender memorial I'll lave you 
Just to let you know I 
was here. 
I'll throw a 
big stone at the window, 
And if any glass I 
should break; 
Its for you all the pains I 
am taking, 
What wouldn't I 
smash for your sake. 
Winastru fillaloo, ttc.

MABEL WYLDE. 
As sung by JOHNNY NOLAN. 
In our dreams we often hear, sweetest voices soft and clear, 
Gently whispering of the little one that died, 
Of our darling angel-child, happy little Mabel Wylde, 
Now at rest where no sorrows can betide, 
Angels guard, protect, and bless, cherish thee with 
tenderness, 
Till we meet at heaven's portals, Mabel Wylde, 
And we ever love to think, that we soon shall reach life's 
bi ink, 
And we're nearing thee, and heaven's angel-child. 
CHORUS. 
In our dreams we often hear, 
Sweetest voicses soft and clear. 
Gently whispering. gently whispering, 
Of the little one that died, 
Gently whispering of the little one that died. 
As we wander day by day, o'er life's weary fruitless way, 
Angels-voices seem to murmur in our ear, 
Do not think that she is dead, tho' she was by death's 
hand led, 
happy is our darling* little angel-child. 
When clouds and shadows fade, and the future seems 
arrayed, 
Wit h 
a 
promise that when happy visions smile, 
l'hat when life's sad dream is o'er on the great eternal shore, 
We will meet our little darling angel-child. 
CHORUS. 
In our dreams we often hear, 
Sweetest voices soft and clear, 
Gently whispering, gently whispering, 
Of the little one that died, 
Gently whispering of the little one that died.

PARODY ON ,4 WHEN THE CORN IS WAVING, 
ANNIE DEAR." 
Written by NED HARRIGAN, for BILLY W EST. 
When the corn is ten cents a 
bushel, and the bunions is painful. 
Annie dear, 
I'll meet you in a 
beer garden, where the liquid is quoted finan-
cially at five cents a 
bowl. 
To hear thy voice in stentorian tones, articulate to the Teutonic 
proprietor to accept your contributions for beer, 
And sit contentedly until the still vapors of the beverage permit 
us in the gutter to roll. 
And when the moon in it's celestial hemisphere betokens individ-
ually that we're full, love, 
The stars with their metropolitan accoutrements, will signify 
their ap )robation by requesling us to g,it. 
Oh come and emigrate, or else my affection will diminish to that 
abbreviation of that coloquial syllable eloqutionized as quit. 
CRORUS. 
When the corn is waving, Annie dear, 
Oh meet me by the stile; 
To hear thy gentle voice again, 
And greet thy willing smile. 
When the corn is dispensated by the sable daughter of Africa, 
spontaneous to her auditors, Annie dear, 
Our tales of love with exhileratin,g chin music we'll convey for per-
sonal aggrandizement to our aristocratic selves. 
Beside the pawnbroker's officially presided over by Mr. Simpson, 
whose cognomen is familiar to your aural appendage called 
[ear. 
Where both of us have garments which formerly protected us from 
the beautiful snow, now arranged alphabetically on the upper 
[shelves. 
To Blackwell's Island where flowers blush and bloom, we'll go, 
love, 
In a 
chariot christened Maria in close proximity to the horse's 
tail. 
Oh haste, Postilion, for my constitutional debility demonstrates 
the fact, I 
require a 
ten days' lay out in jail. 
When the corn is waving, Annie (bar 
Oh meet me by the stile; 
To hear thy gentle voice again, 
And greet thy willing smile.

GIVE ME A PENNY. 
Dedicated to Mr. FRANK CARROLL. Balladist. 
By Pan,. 11. MOWRRY. 
Give me a 
penny, ' tis the voice of a 
child, 
That often you hear in the wintry winds wild, 
Out in the street I 
wander so drear, 
No one to comfort me, no loving friend near, 
All all are gone to that bright world above, 
None left to care for me, none left to love. 
I'm weary and hungry, no where to lay my head. 
0 
give me a 
penny for mother is dead. 
CHORUS 
0, weary I 
wander out in the street, 
No one to care for me, no friend I 
meet. 
I 
ask not for riches, I 
only want bread. 
Give me a 
penny for mother is dead. 
Give me a 
penny ; by the gas-light 
Sadly I 
wander all through the night ; 
Wherever I 
wander, wherever I 
roam, 
I 
think of the mother, and, my once happy home. 
But now they're all gone, I'm left here alone; 
No one to care for me, I 
have no home. 
Father, mother, and friends, are all gone, 
So give me a 
penny to help me along. 
0, weary I 
wander, &c. 
Give me a 
penny ! 0 pass rue not by, 
For without bread, very soon I 
in t1St die. 
Soon I 
will go, it will not be long; 
No one will think of me when I 
am gone. 
But when I 
go to that bright world above 
I'll meet father, and mother, and friends that 
I 
love. 
Far I 
have wandered, I'm weary and wet, 
0, give me a 
penny. 
I've nothing to eat. 
0, weary I 
wander; & c.

KILLARNEY.—[CoNcLuDED.1 
Innisfallen's ruined shrine 
May suggest a 
passing sigh; 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by. 
Castle Lough and Glena Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagles' Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye 
With such bright and varied tint; 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints ; 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries doff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair: 
Beauty's home, Killarney 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstasy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud-wreaths in that sky. 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine: 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

I AIN'T A GWINE TO DO SO NO MO. 
Written by NED HARRIGAN expressly for BILLY Was. 
I've had my share of trouble, 
While I've been here below ; 
By being kind o' foolish, 
Since I 
began to grow. 
I 
throwed away my books, 
When I 
went to school ; 
The teacher stood me on a 
desk, 
For the boys to call me fool. 
mionus. 
But I 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no inert, 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no more, 
De teacher cut my hand with his awful big ratan, 
But he ain't a 
gwine to do so no more. 
I 
used to go a 
fishing, 
Wid needles, hooks and pin; 
Fish jerked me in de water, 
And den I 
couldn't swim. 
I 
floated like a 
sponge cake, 
I 
used in water soak; 
De doctor said they couldn't drown, 
Such an awful foolish moke. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no more, 
.1 ain't a 
gwine to do so no more, 
Salt water ain't dry, if you don't believe it go and try. 
But I 
ain't a 
gwine to do Bono mote. 
Den I 
went, and fell in love, 
I 
fell almighty hard; 
Wid a 
gal who had a 
temper, 
You could measure by the yard. 
She hit me wid a 
club, 
When I 
asked her for a 
kiss; 
She went and got her brother Bill, 
For to shoot at me and miss. 
CHORUS. 
But he ain't a 
gwine to do so no more, 
He ain't a 
gwine to do so no more, 
I'm gwine to stay under the bed and cover up my head, 
Re ain't a 
gwine to do so no more. 
I 
wish I 
was an onion, 
'Bout a 
water melon size; 
id git in dat gal's family, 
To make her cry out her eyes. 
If I 
was a 
bull dog, 
Her brother Bill I'd bite ; 
Den he'd go mad and eat, his dad, 
Don't you think that's doing right. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no more. 
I 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no more, 
For Hydrophobia's bad, there's no fun in getting mad., 
I 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no more.

GAMBLERS. 
Pete.—" I 
bad a 
dream last night. 
Steve. — What did you dream?" 
Pete.-1 
dream% we were both playing cards. 
Clubs 
were trumps; you begged, and I 
gave " you one," ( pre-
tends to strike him.) 
Steve.—" Hold on, I 
never play cards!" 
Pete.—" Yes, you do; we all play cards." 
Steve.—" How do you make that out ?' 
Pete.—" Our life is but a 
game of cards, 
Which each one has to learn ; 
Each shuffles, cuts and deals his cards, 
Anti each his trump Cloth turn. 
Some turn a 
high card to the top, 
While others turn a 
low ; 
Some hold a 
hand quite flush of trumps, 
When others none can show. 
When hearts are trumps 
We play for love, and pleasure decks the hour; 
No thought of sorrow checks our joys, 
In friendship's rosy bower. 
For when the heart is on the top, 
We our cards at random play ; 
But when the heart is in the hand, 
Our life is but a 
holiday. 
When diamonds chance to crown the pack, 
'Tis then men stake their gold; 
Large stuns are often lost and won, 
By gamblers, young and old. 
Each watches his neighbor, 
111 chance to catch him cheat upon the Sly 
It is then when men become the dupes of rogues, 
And rogues each other cheat. 
And he is indeed a 
wise man, 
Who never meets defeat. 
When clubs are trumps look out for war, 
On ocean and on land; 
For horrid deeds are often done, 
When clubs are in the hand. 
The last game of all is when the spade 
Is turned by the hand of Time ; 
'Tis he that finishes up the game, 
In every laud and clime. 
No mat ter how much each may win, 
Or how 
each may save; 
You'll find the spades turn up at last, 
And digs the player's grave. 
Ana so you see, Steve, we all play cards."

STAR OF BROADWAY. 
As sung by JOHNNY SMITH, COMIC Vocalist. 
I 
am one of those glorious, jovial young bricks 
That don't care a 
jot, whate'er is my lot, 
I 
toss off a 
glass, though I 
am not a 
sot, 
Or a 
slave to that beverage quite. 
In society there appearance we keep, 
And don't indulge too much in wine, 
While at night, boys, we roam, while others do sleep, 
For in Broadway, this star it does shine. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am the star of Broadway, aha 
Of Broadway, aim! of Broadway, atm! 
For I 
am the star of Broadway, aha! 
And shine most at night, my dear boys, hurrah. 
I 
drive to the races in my four-in-hand, 
Like a 
lord in the land, I 
cut it grand, 
Right down the road, till I 
reach the grand stand, 
Where my place is already marked out, 
I 
draw my pencil, and pocket- book for sooth, 
And to make a 
short book I 
begin, 
With beats, my boys, I 
never book, 
But to stand against chance for to win. 
For I 
am, &c. 
My ( line, all I 
can. the ladies annoy, 
To their perfect joy I 
make them my toy. 
When naught else to do, sure for to find 
A little mischief to do, I 
declare. 
I 
crack a 
good joke, or smoke a

Or at billiards for a

There are none can equal this Broadway star, 
So for me you must clear the way.

DICK DARLIN', THE COBBLER. 
Rang by W. F. Sixchun LAWLOR in CHAS. MAcEvor's 
original Hibernicou. 
Och 
my name is Dick Darlin' the cobbler, 
My time I 
served down there in Kent; 
Wid de wimmin I 
was always a 
squabbler, 
But now I'm resolved to repent. 
For twenty years I'd been a 
rover, 
An' wasted the prime of my life; 
One day, I 
resolved to give over, 
An' settle myself sown to a 
wife. 
Spokrn: Yes, I 
got married. 
Now, upon my conscience a 
women is the most obstroperous and outrageous creature on the 
face of the earth. 
Before I was married, whiniver I'd go 
among 'em: they'd be fighting for me ; and when I 
married one 
them, in th.rt hopes to be quiet and peaceable, bad strati to 
he day she'd be aisy if she wasn't fighting wid me: 
Now 
give ye the eontints uv my oath: that before I 
was 
married, there wasn't a 
nicer, quieter, dacenter, bether disposed 
or meeker disposition'd boy than myself; but since I'm married 
heeled if I didn't gSt into a 
bit of a 
fight now an' then, I'd go 
5nouldy. 
And divil a 
fight iver I 
was in or- heard tett of, but a 
woman was at the tot., the bottom, both sides, and in the middle 
Evf it. 
My wife she was blinkin' an' blearin' 
My wife she 
as humpy and black, 
The divil all over for swearin', 
And her tongt.e is kept goin' click clack.. 
(Spoken): 
Bad luck to me if iver I 
could tell how a 
woman'; 
!teigue is bung at all! 
We 
all 
know that a 
man's tongue is 
hung by one ind, but bad semi to me if I 
don't think that a 
woman's is hung be the middle, an' no sooner one ind strikes 
the upper part of her jaw, but the other ind hits the lower, an' 
there it is, upper an' lower, the whole day peltin' ' till at la,it 
I'd have to give her a 
welt la the gob 161 my last to stop her 
[13

DICK DARLIN' THE COBBLER. 
an' thin she'd run out of the cellar, roarin' Watch, watch, watch! 
here's this tnurder'n villin' he's killin' me, he's give me a 
welt 
in the gob mid his last, an' he's broka the collar bone of me. 
A—rew, wirrastrew! what'll I do ? 
And thin widout 
waitin' for any one to tell her what to do she up wid a 
brick 
an' lets drive at me. 
I 
can dodge it aisy enough ' cause I'm 
us'd to it it ; but another poor divil there stanin' by, and not 
an yin' a 
word to any body, he got it plump in the mug; up 
comes the police, an' walks the three of us off for assult and 
batthery. an' hang the one got batthered but the poor divil 
who had nothing to do wid it. 
But that's the 
ay of it. evil 
communications corrupt good manners. 
But now we are parted for iver— 
One mornin' before it was light, 
I 
shod the old jade in a 
river, 
And cautiously bid her good night. 
My troubles of wedlock bein' over, 
This country I 
thought I 
would try; 
Once more I've become a 
free rover, 
An' single Ill stop till I 
die. 
Spoken: A fellow came into my shop the other day. 
Dick, 
says he. 
Sir, says I. 
I'll bet ye three dollars to one, says he, 
that I 
can sole three pair of boots while you sole one, 
You 
can't, says T. 
Will ye bet, says he, 
I 
will, says I. 
Done, 
says he 
Done, says I, and to work we whit. 
An' either I'd 
bate him, as an Irishman ought to do, the dirty bla'guard 
wouldn't pay rue. 
But maybe I 
hadn't satisfaction out of him ; 
wint out an' I 
bate him ; I 
bate him till I 
was as blind as a 
bat. 
I 
bate him till I 
broke nearly all the bones in my body, 
and they had to carry me home on a 
shutther. 
lie come to me 
aftherwards, an' says be, you ought to pay me somethin'. 
Didn't I 
give you a practical lesson in industhry ? 
You 
didn't know how much work you could do till I 
brou ,, ht it out 
tiv you, says he. 
Be gob! but I knew how much work he 
hindered me from ( loin'. 
Bat hould on a 
bit; let me come 
aerosA him again, if iver I COMO across him again—by my 
mother's beautiful son and that's my illegant self I'll keep

" PLEASE GOD, MAKE ROOM FOR A LITTLE 
BOY!" 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year b374, by WiErrrn and 
GOULLAUD, in the Office of the Libiarian of Congress, Washington, D. C. 
These were the last words of " Americus," the well-known child violinist, 
seven years of age, who expired very suddenly during the night of January 
10th, 1874, in Boston 
So quietly did his spirit take its ilight, that his 
father, who occupied the same room, although hearing hi s 
son make the 
foregoing exclamation, thought the boy was talking in his sleep, and was 
horrified to find the little child, cold in death, in the morning. 
The Music of this Song is published by W HITE & GOULLATTD, 86 Tremont 
St., Boston, Mass. 
Price 35 cents. 
Written by DEXTER SMITH. 
Music by SIDNEY GRAVES. 
" 
GOOD night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close, 
And a 
smile came o'er his features radiant with holy joy, 
As if angels came to whisper tidings to our little boy. 
" 
Good night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close. 
CnoRTIS. 
" 
Good night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died at, died at twilight's close. 
When night draped her sable curtain, hanging folds upon each 
star, 
Came a 
halo soft and lustrous, streaming o'er the window bar; 
And we heard our darling murmur, as the brightness lit his face, 
" 
Please God, make me room in Heaven, make your little boy a 
place !" 
" 
Good night, father!" said our darling, as he sank to sweet 
repose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close. 
" 
Good night, father !" etc. 
He was weary of the struggle, discords jarred upon his soul ; 
And his gentle spirit left us, wafted to the heavenly goal ; 
He has room among the angels, he is freed from sin and care; 
God, who watcheth e'en the sparrow, answered little Jimlnie's 
Prayer. 
" 
Good night, father !" said our darling, as he sank to sweet re-
pose, 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music died away at twilight's close.

DIGGING FOR GOULD. 
Darby Kelly below in Killkenny did live, 
A sketch of whose character I'm going to give; 
He was thought by the people a 
green polished rogue, 
He could wasfle the whiskey, or wastle the old brogue; 
All kinds of diseases with herbs he could cure, 
he'd interpret your dreams to be certain and sure, 
By the boys of the village he often was fool'd; 
For aslape or awake, he was dreaming of gould. 
Fol de dol, 
He had a 
fine open house, but the winders were broke, 
The gables were down to let out the smoke ; 
Some beautiful pigs, through the wide world to range, 
Though they were thin, they were thick with the mange, 
He was so neglectful of domestic affairs, 
The rats eat the bottoms all out of the chairs, 
And the wife by the husband was so overruled, 
When she asked him for coppers, he was talking of gould. 
Fol de dol, cte. 
The house thus neglecten, sure nothing went rigbt; 
When a 
youth of the village came to him, one night, 
A 
nice boy he was, his name was Dan Mac, 
And ready to fly with the duds on his back; 
All the clothes that he had wasn't enough 
To make him a 
bolster to stick on a 
crutch, 
And his juvenile days in a 
lime-kiln were schooled, 
But he used to cod Darby about finding gould. 
Fol de dol, &G. 
Says Dan; Ere last night I 
had a 
beautiful dream; 
Bit bad luck to the doubt! last night I'd the same; 
And to-day, as I 
dozed, after slacking some lime, 
I 
dreamt it again for the third and last time. 
Och, murder! says Darby, come tell us your dream, 
Same time his two eyes like rockets did gleam, 
Says Dan; I 
dreamt at the castle Kilcool 
I 
found a 
jar that was crammed full of gould. 
Fol de dol, dr.o 
DIGGING FOR GOULD. 
—
[CONCLUDED.j 
Poor Darby a 
big mouth opened like a 
dead IIaicke, 
Saying: You'll be a 
hero, just like your name-sake; 
You'll ride in your coach, you fortunate elf, 
While I 
may be in one, going down to the hulks. 
/1-o 
matter, said Darby, we must emigrate, 
So, come down at mid-night, and do 
tit be too late; 
Bring some boys whose courage won't easy be cooled, 
And we'll dig till daylight to find all the gould. 
Fol de dol, 
Tbe:,7 arrived at tne easne, at about one o'clock, 
Where Dan dreamt he found all the gold in a 
crock, 
They all set to work with picks, shovels and spades. 
And a 
hole, that would swallow a 
house, soon was mad( 
Says Darby: Bad luck to the curse we must give. 
Or we'll be beggars as long as we live I 
Says Dan: My the devil on my back be stooled, 
For, I 
have bursted my breeches in digging for gould I 
Fol de dol, drc. 
The prayers availed nottring, the crock was soon found, 
Tim Rooney he lifted it over the ground; 
With joy Darby leaped on the back of Ned Fail, 
Like a 
fish from the stream with a 
hook in his tail, 
Says Darby: My wife won't abuse me to-night, 
When I 
take home the shiners so yellow and bright! 
I'll buy house and land about Killcool. 
And we'll all bless the night we went digging for gould I 
Fol de dol, dLe. 
The croclt was men placed on Darby's own back, 
To carry home and each man have his whack, 
They arrived at the door with the gould to be sacked, 
When Mac with a 
spade knocked the crock into smash 
Poor Darby, near smothered, ran in with affright; 
His wife jumps up to get him a 
light: 
When she heard Darby mourning, her passion was cooled, 
She, knew by the smell he was covered with gould! 
Fol de dol,

PUT BY FOR A RAINY DAY. 
Oftirnes the world may laugh, and jeer at what I'm going to 
say, 
That is, provide yourselves, my friends, in case of a 
rainy 
day; 
For if you don't, when you grow old, on what I 
say depend, 
If you can't help yourself, 'tis hard to find a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
So now be careful, and be wise, and, like me, stow away, 
A 
little pelf, to protect yourself, in case of a 
rainy day; 
Be not extravagant or mean, have just what you require, 
Be kind and provident to all, it is my heart's desire; 
When I 
see my fellow creature is trodden down with strife, 
To 
help him on the road is a 
proud time of my life. 
So now be careful, &C. 
" 
Waste not, want not," my motto is, a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
And this another I'd prescribe : " Touch nothing out of reach ;* 
For " honesty's best policy," so honest people say, 
And just remember, though but small, put up for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, & c. 
A 
pin a 
day, is a 
groat a 
year, which proves that the smallest 
mite 
Put by will soon accumulate, and shows my words are right; 
So persevere when in your youth, and then when old you'll say, 
I 
care not now how the world treats me, I 
thought of a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, &c. 
I'm hale, I'm jolly, as you can see, and I 
like my 
friends to call, 
Though the best of friends I've ever found, was my pocket, 
after all ; 
For that old friend sticks to me still, through thick and thin., 
I 
say, 
If you would be advised by me, put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, & c. 
" 
A friend in need's a 
friend indeed," but how often whek 
you're poor, 
Those friends will pass you one by one, and on you close the 
door; 
So let your motto be like mine, whate'er the world may say, 
Look out for number one, that is —put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, iko. 
BUFFALO. 
Written by Ned Harrigan. 
Sung by BILLY WEsT. 
From Buffalo I've just come down 
On the good boat Danger; 
A long, long trip on the Erie, boys, 
I 
feel just like a 
stranger. 
We'd heavy fogs, and awful storms, 
Forget 'em I 
never shall ; 
I'm every inch a 
sailor boy, 
On the E-ri-o Canal. 
We were loaded down with barley, 
When we Ida good bye ; 
When a 
pirate bore upon its, 
With an awful wicked eye. 
I 
saw him through the spy- glass, 
I 
put up a 
flag of truce ; 
I 
found it was the Three Sisters, 
Four days from Syracuse. 
Three days' out we struck a 
rock, 
Of Lackawana coal ; 
It gave the boat an awful shock, 
And stove in quite a 
hole. 
I 
halloed to the driver, 
On the tow -path's treaden dirt ; 
He came aly ,ard and stcpped the leak, 
With his flannel undershirt. 
In two years we reached the Hudson, 
We hadn't slept a 
wink ; 
The crew mntinized 
Because I 
refused a 
drink. 
Keep up your courage, then I 
cried, 
I'll bring you safely in ; 
And when we strike a 
grocery store, 
We'll swim in barrels of gin. 
The storm went down, we went ashore, 
me 
an d 
Sal ad Hank ; 
Greased ourselves with tallow- fat, 
And slid out on a 
plank. 
Sal is in the Peer House, 1 
o3- s, 
The crew are all in jail ; 
I'm the only sole surviving moke, 
Left to tell the tale. 
Spoken.— So Haul in your bow line, 
Stnnd by your sorrel mule, 
Low bridge, boys, dodge your heads; 
Don't act just like a 
fool. 
CliORT.78. 
For the Erie is a 
rising, 
And the gin is getting low : 
I 
hardly think you'll get a 
drink, 
Till we go back to Buffalo.

PAT ROACH AT TITT1 PLAY. 
The Music of this Song can be obtained for 10 cents of E. II. IIAUDING, 
288 Bowery. 
As Pat Roach and the Missus, from Galway, 
In Dublin once happened to be, 
To the playhouse they went one fine evening, 
Determined diversion to see. 
But, says Pat as he entered, " there's no one." 
"Pay here !" cried a 
voice. " Holy murther !" 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
"Pay here!" cries a 
voice. " Holy murther I" 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
The missus she looked all around her, 
In wonder her eyes they did roll, 
" 
But," says she, " Paddy, darling, alanna, 
lie is here like a 
rat in a 
hole ; 
" 
Pay here, how much is it ?" " a 
shilling." 
" 
A 
shilling apiece, that won't do ; 
'Tis too much, Mister Pay here avourneen, 
Eighteen pince, I 
will give you for two; 
'Tis too much, Mister Pay here avourneen, 
Eighteen pince, I 
will give you for two." 
Pat grumbled, but paid and got seated, 
The baud was beginning to play; 
He jigged on his seat quite elated, 
And to the musicians did say: 
"'Tis yer selves that can do it, me bouchals, 
And I 
wish to ye's wid all me mind ; 
(1) 
PAT ROACH AT THE PLAY.—Continuod. 
To the fiddlers more power to your elbows, 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, yer wind, 
To the fiddlers more power to your elbows, 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, yer wind." 
The play then went on, and Pat wondered, 
And sat with his mouth open wide, 
As the proud haughty Lord of the Manor 
Sought to make the fair maiden his bride; 
" 
To the mountains," says he, " I 
will bear thee." 
She shrieked as she saw him approach: 
" 
Is there no one at hand now to save me 7" 
Shouts a 
voice: " yis, me darlin', Pat Roach." 
Then up on the seat jumped brave Paddy, 
Says he: " now, you blackguard, be gone, 
Or a 
lord though you be tin times over, 
I'll knock your two eyes into one." 
" 
Sit down there in front !" " What, you spalpeen, 
Is it me you thus dare to addriss ? 
Do ye think that Pat Roach would sit aisy, 
And see that poor girl in distriss ?" 
A 
scuffle ensued in a 
minute, 
But soon sure the row did subside; 
And, as Pat gasped for breath, he discovered 
Of the door he was on the wrong side; 
He soon found the missus, next morning 
They started for home, and Pat swore 
If he once safely landed in Galway, 
He'd come up to Dublin no more.

THE II= CONVENTION. 
A famous Hen Convention 
Was held in Humbug Green— 
Such a 
stow of fuss and feathers 
Ne'er before was seen, 
With Malays, Bantams, Chitagongs, 
And game- fowls, fine and tall; 
But Mr. Rooster Shanghai 
Cut the biggest swell of all. 
It was cackle, cackle, cackle, cackle, 
Flap your wings and crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the highest 
At the Hen Convention Show, 
Says Malay, pulling out his gills, 
"I'm the fairest fowl," 
Says Bantam, " You're a 
hen-pick'd race— 
Hen-hearted, with no soul." 
Says Shanghai, " Your poor Bantams 
Are a 
race of chicken toys," 
Says Bantam, " If you peck at me, 
You'll find I'm one of the boys." 
It was cackle, 41c. 
A poultry duel came on straight— 
'Twas Bantam and Shanghai; 
A crow at first, and then a 
clip, 
And then the feathers fly. 
Young Bantam spurred him flat, 
Amid a 
loud convention crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the lowest 
At the great Convention Show. 
It was cael-le, & c.
