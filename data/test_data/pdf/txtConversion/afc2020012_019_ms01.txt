[0:00] AG: Hi, Beverly. Thank you so much again for participating in these Library of Congress oral 
histories. Can I ask you to introduce yourself, please? 
  
BF: Hi. My name is Beverly Foss. I live in Minneapolis, a suburb of Minneapolis. I work at the 
Minneapolis VA, and have been there since 1978. 
  
AG: Oh, terrific. Can we begin by talking a little bit about your upbringing and your experiences 
growing up? 
  
BF: Sure. 
  
AG: Where did you grow up? 
  
BF: I grew up in Bloomington, Minnesota, not far from the Met's Stadium, which is where the Twins 
played. My parents lived there until after I graduated from nursing school. What else would you like to 
know? 
  
AG: What kind of work did your parents do? 
  
BF: My dad worked for the electric company. He had a couple of jobs. The first one was as a meter 
reader, and then he ended up working as a bill collector for a little while, and then he ended his career 
at-- it was NSP at the time, Northern States Power, which is now Xcel Energy. He ended his career there 
doing high bill complaints. He would drive out to wherever anybody would say, "Hey, my electric bill 
seems a little bit high." He'd kind of go through their houses and go, "Well, your freezer takes a lot of 
energy," or, "Did you realize your pool is using a lot of energy?" He'd tell us a little bit about that when 
we were growing up. My mom worked at a factory. She did shipping for a small company that made 
engine heaters for cars and trucks. My brothers and I all ended up getting jobs there during the summer 
and I worked there my senior year, so I was able to save up a little bit of money for school. I kind of 
enjoyed factory work. It's kind of mindless. I knew I didn't want to do it for the rest of my life, but kind 
of didn't mind the repetition or anything, and got most of my enjoyment from work by visiting with 
coworkers while we were on the line. After I graduated from high school, I went to two years of college 
because I figured that that would help me. I was just gonna go to Bible School for a year, 'cause I 
figured that would help me kind of figure out what I wanted to do with my life. At the end of the year, I 
had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I lived on campus. There were several people that lived at 
home and commuted, and I would ride back with them on the weekends. One of the girls-- I just really 
didn't want to go back to work at the factory for the summer. She said, "Well, you should come and 
work with me." She worked in a nursing home, and so I got a job as a nursing assistant. My first shift 
was working with an aide. I followed her around for the shift. Then the next day I had my own 
assignment. It's like, that was orientation in taking care of people, huh. Now I know that that's not great. 
At the time, I thought, "Wow! They really trust me." At the end of that summer I really had grown in 
love with the kind of work that I did, and thought nursing might not be a bad career. I was working with 
a lot of patients with dementia and just kind of really enjoyed doing that personal care and taking their 
teeth out and brushing them and stuff like that. Most of my co-workers really complained about the 
patients. They're like, "Ah, this old lady she's so--." [Unintelligible] if they dislike it that much and I like 
it this much, this might be the job for me. So, the next year I went back to school, took some of the 
prerequisites for nursing 'cause it was too late to get into a nursing program. I'm not exactly the

firecracker when it comes to getting stuff done, so I didn't apply for nursing school by the end of that 
year either, and I ended up working a year, again, as a nursing assistant and got into nursing school the 
following year. Went to [unintelligible] Midway, which was a three-year diploma in St. Paul. I had 
talked to a number of nurses, “What kind of nursing program should I do?” Its two-year programs were 
pretty robust at the time. Four-year programs were, of course, everybody wanted to get their degree. I 
asked, "What's the best one to do?" and most of them said, "You need to figure out what your goal is. 
Do you want to do bedside nursing? Do you want to do administration?" I just really wanted to be a 
really good bedside nurse. So, I went to the three-year program and I graduated in 1980. One of our 
rotations was at the VA, and it was a neurology rotation. The VA was not very many people's favorite 
rotation. One of the mornings when we got into the parking lot, we were walking into the building. I was 
one of the few students who had a car, so we all kind of piled into my Toyota Corolla. There were five 
of us. It was a little bit crowded. I'd forgotten something in the car, so they went into the building and I 
went back to get my thing. As I was walking toward the building, I just remember thinking, “This is 
really kinda hokey,” but it's like the sky opened up and I heard music and went, "I'm gonna work here." 
So, during that rotation, we asked if they were hiring students, and they said, "You know, we used to 
have a program where we did and we're not doing that anymore." I thought, "Okay, well, that's that. I'm 
not gonna be there." A couple weeks later, they said, "You know, we are actually hiring students". So, I 
applied, got the job, and I have actually been there since. I did quit twice but came back. Anything else 
you want to know about me growing up? 
  
AG: Yeah, I'm so curious to know what that rotation was like in neurology as a student. You were 
seeing-- was that mostly dementia or was it brain injury patients or was it any kind of neurological? 
  
[7:47] BF: It was mostly stroke patients. As students, we just thought the VA was really gross. It just 
seemed dirty and the patients seemed kinda disheveled, and it was like the bottom of the barrel for 
nursing homes [laughs]. We just kinda thought, "Eww." The charts were different from what we were 
used to; it was all paper charts. Most of our rotations were at Midway Hospital, which is a private 
hospital in St. Paul, and we also went to Miles Park, which was a little bit nicer hospital in another part 
of St. Paul, but their focus was more psych and chemical dependency. We did do some rotations-- We'd 
get to Hennepin County or Ramsey, which is now Regions, but most of it was at Midway, so when we 
went to the VA and the charts were disorganized, it was a challenging rotation. Then when I did get my 
job there, I started in neurology. It's a little difficult to remember what it was as a student versus what it 
was as a nursing assistant. They had kind of a cutting edge unit. It was like an intensive neurology 
section, which the patients were supposed to get a little bit higher level of care. That was an eight-bed 
unit. I don't know if there were 25 or 30 patients, but those were the patients who maybe had recent 
strokes or some other things. I remember we had a guy there with a really rare condition. It was called 
stiff man syndrome, and he literally was just a super stiff guy. He didn't really bend. I don't remember 
anything more about him. I do remember meeting the wife of an old patient. She was a retired nurse, and 
she had started working in nursing in the 1920s. She said, "When I started, taking a blood pressure was 
still considered a medical function. The nurses weren't allowed to do it; the doctors had to do it.” I 
thought, "Wow, we've come a long way, just with--." At that time, I would get to take care of patients 
that had IVs. I wasn't working with the IVs, but I thought that was pretty cool. 
  
AG: Absolutely. What do you think drew you to the VA, especially having that kind of revelation with 
how sort of dingy and disorganized it also was? Was there something about it that called to you?

[11:11] Not really. It just felt like it was what I was supposed to do. After graduation, I'd gotten a job at 
Abbott Northwestern, because I wanted to work in oncology. I was kinda drawn to the whole death and 
dying, and read Elisabeth Kubler Ross's book on death and dying. I thought, you know, it's amazing to 
me that just 20 years prior, it was unusual for doctors to tell patients when they had cancer. People need 
to know. Even if it's bad news, people need to know what's going on with them. They go to a doctor for 
a reason, to find out what it is, and the fact that people didn't know, even just that recently, was kind of 
interesting to me. Oncology sounded like a really good job. I got hired in oncology at Abbott like I said, 
but since I was working as a nursing assistant at the VA, I went for my exit interview and my manager 
said, "Well, why are you leaving the VA?" "Because I want to work in oncology." She goes, "Well, we 
have oncology here" [laughs]. "Okay," and then she said, "And we have five weeks of vacation your 
first year. Why would you leave that?" I went, "Oh, that is a good point." So, I didn't actually leave the 
VA. I stayed. I ended up staying at the VA. Because I was working there as a nursing assistant, I had to 
go to an exit interview with my nurse manager. She was like, "Well, so what are you gonna do? Do you 
have a job?" and I said, "I have a job at Abbott Northwestern. I'm gonna work in oncology," and she 
said, "Well, we have oncology here. Why don't you just stay here?" I was kinda excited to go to 
Northwestern, 'cause it's a great hospital and the VA has never had a great reputation for being a good 
hospital. But then her next line was, "You get five weeks of vacation your first year here. Why would 
you leave that?" I kinda went, "You're right. Why would I leave that? That's kind of appealing.” So, I 
did not actually leave the VA and go to Abbott. I stayed at the VA and got a job working on a med surg 
floor, not med surg, straight up medicine floor. 
  
AG: You were there as a student doing rotations and then they offered you a job there as you graduated, 
and you did a medical floor. What does that entail, being on the medical floor? 
  
BF: The VA separated rehab, so physical rehab, which I did end up working there instead of neurology 
as the student nurse tech, and I did get to do a lot of-- The staff that I worked with saw my enthusiasm 
for patient care. Looking back, I'm like, yeah, I'm sure they loved working with me 'cause I would do 
everything. It's like, "Oh! I can put in a catheter, okay. Oh, I can do range of motion, okay." I was kind 
of very excited to get to practice the skills that I was learning in school. I was really looking forward to 
working in oncology, and then staying at the VA [unintelligible]-- they separated things, so there was 
neurology, there was a neurology ward, there was a rehab ward. The patients who are getting physical 
therapy for post-stroke or post-amputation or anything, it was a pretty good comprehensive inpatient 
program for them. We also had an oncology ward, we had a Special Diagnostic and Treatment Unit, 
which was a kind of a research ward. Then we had surgical wards that were separated between 
cardiology and GI, and then we had the medicine wards, which was just kinda everything else. At the 
time, so 1980, patients would get admitted for a heart cath, 'cause that was kind of a big deal. They'd get 
in, they'd have a day before their procedure, and then we would watch them for two or three days after 
their procedure to make sure that they were okay and that they weren't gonna bleed and stuff. We also 
would admit patients for colonoscopies. They'd get their three-day prep beforehand, we'd make sure that 
they weren't eating food and they were only getting liquids, and then they get their prep, they'd have the 
procedure, and then we'd watch 'em afterwards to make sure that they were okay, and then they'd get to 
go home after that. The acuity wasn't awful, but those patients were there, the same as patients who were 
there for diagnostic studies, who were getting workups for heart conditions or they had a bunch of other 
symptoms. We'd be sending 'em for x-rays, but they would only get one thing a day because of capacity. 
There'd be staffing issues. Not staffing issues, but radiology only had a certain number of people who 
would work there, so you'd only get a certain number of procedures done, so it took a long time for

things to get done. Not our neurology, our medicine ward could be kind of anything as far as what 
patients needed, and there were definitely different levels of acuity. If somebody's in for a colonoscopy 
prep, they're up walking around, really not needing a lot of nursing care, but if you have somebody 
who's had something else going on, they might need IV antibiotics and that would be every four hours, 
and you could have kind of anything. At the time, on a day shift, you would typically have anywhere 
from six to eight patients. On an evening shift, you could have eight to even half the ward, which was-- 
the ward was 45 patients. You could have 22 patients. Just kind of keeping track of it was challenging, 
but the days went fast, [unintelligible]. 
  
AG: Was it one nurse for 22 patients sometimes on the overnight shift? 
  
[18:58] BF: Yeah, overnights, and that was kinda why I quit and went to the U. It's kinda fun to think 
back. I remember in a number of shifts where there would be two RN's-- We had 45 patients, and, like I 
said, they could be anything. If they're there for colonoscopy prep, just not that time consuming. I 
remember one shift where it was memorable because it was my birthday, but I'd gotten a patient who 
had been in intensive care and he was there for a GI bleed. He came to our ward because basically he 
was not getting better and he was dying. His name was Albert, and I spent most of my shift taking care 
of him. I had still all of my other patients to watch, and also was probably between 12 and 15 others. I'd 
run out, get them their meds and do whatever they needed, but then I'd have to go back and take care of 
Albert. He, like I said, had a GI bleed, so he was getting two different medications through an NG tube. 
He would get, essentially, Maalox and then I'd have to clamp his tube for an hour, and then he'd get 
lactulose and I'd have to clamp this tube after that. What lactulose does is it binds with toxins in your 
blood and then you have diarrhea. I literally was spending my entire shift giving him medication through 
his tube, clamping him, knowing full well I would have to clean him from head to toe about half an hour 
later. I was kind of running ragged and he was comatose. It was just a lot of just taking care of literally 
this body. I started my shift at 3:30. 10:15 I had not had my lunch break yet, and I was kinda feeling 
sorry for myself ‘cause it was my birthday and here I was taking care of this comatose guy. He opened 
his eyes and he said, "You have the most beautiful hands," and I just kind of melted. Alright, that was all 
worth it, 'cause I do not have beautiful hands, I never have, but his perception was just kind of enough to 
keep me going. Over the course of the next couple of weeks, he woke up. He was just a delightful guy to 
take care of, so that just kinda got me going. I thought, "It's worth it to do this job." 
  
AG: Yeah, absolutely. That's so powerful to think about, like you said, just how stressful and straining it 
must have been for you to care for, like you said, this person who was at that point-- 
  
BF: Right! 
  
AG: [Unintelligible], screaming, and then to have him interact with you and on your birthday. Oh my 
goodness. Wow. This is also your very first full-time job as a nurse, right? 
  
BF: Right, right. This is my first birthday working as a nurse. I'm like, "Is this what my life is gonna be 
like?" 
  
AG: Exactly [laughs]. 
  
BF: Yeah.

AG: Do you remember your impression back then as you were becoming acquainted with nursing? 
Were you thinking that it was too much for you or did it feel really fulfilling? Do you have any 
recollection of your impressions of either the VA or of nursing more generally as you started? 
  
[23:17] BF: It felt very fulfilling. I really enjoyed what I did. I certainly didn't go home and tell my 
parents what my day was like. I do remember many, many days driving home after work, and I did 
actually still live with my parents when I started working at the VA. I just remember driving down 494. 
I drove past the airport and I'd just have tears in my eyes and go, "What did I do today? All I did was put 
pills in people's faces.” It was not fun. It was not rewarding. I was just kind of starting to realize, "Oh 
yeah. The doctors drive the boat and patients just take pills and is this really what medicine is all about?" 
That was just learning the job and learning what medications did and learning to watch for side effects 
and people's responses to medications and stuff. Those first several years were just kind of figuring that 
out, and then, over time-- When you graduate from school, you just think, "Oh, I'm gonna have such an 
impact on people's lives and every word that comes out of my mouth, they're gonna believe me and 
they're gonna do what I say." Now, after 40 years, I'm like, "Oh, you know, it's your choice. Here are 
your medications. This is what you can do with your lifestyle, but you got to do what you got to do to.” I 
think over the years, I've learned that the most important thing in patient care is to just help people 
empower themselves, figure out what they themselves can do to improve their health, encourage them in 
their relationship with their doctors, encourage them in their relationships with their families. I think 
that's maybe one thing that stands out from a lot of veterans versus a lot of people in private health care. 
I know in the public health places, like the Hennepin County regions, they get a lot of difficult personal 
situations just like we do, but I feel like we get a lot of patients who have either given up on their 
families or the families have given up on them, so we have that challenge. There's a lot of social 
challenges that a lot of our patients face. 
  
AG: Are there lessons that you've learned from caring for the veteran population for, like you said, 40 
years, and sort of some of what might distinguish them, like you were saying, kind of social issues or 
family issues? 
  
BF: Boy, I have a feeling a lot of it-- I kind of accept that everybody's life is different. It's kind of what 
they've made it. I'm not sure how to say it. Like, if my husband meets somebody, if we're out to eat and, 
you know, he'll strike up a conversation with one of our servers and just kinda-- everything they say, 
he's just kinda taking it at face value. I'm like, "You're interpreting what's going on with how our lives 
are, so the words that they're saying, you might not really be hearing what they're actually telling us 
about their life." He's kind of interpreting their life experience in light of how we live our lives, and I 
will kind of interpret it with, "Well, if you were one of my patients, what I'm hearing you say is, you've 
got a lot more going on than you want us to know about.” Does that make sense? 
  
AG: Yeah. It sounds like you develop real skill for reading between the lines and interpreting some of 
those subtle clues or deflections. 
  
BF: Right, yeah. They're telling you this, but it's not quite as rosy as all that. So, “We're gonna give them 
a really good tip, okay?” [chuckles]. You know, that kinda thing.

AG: Yeah, it sounds like you're really intuitive and kind of tuned into what's said and what's not said 
because of the patient care component. I imagine you have to really be sensitive to all of those 
fluctuations in demeanor. 
  
BF: Right. 
  
AG: I see. That makes sense. Beverly, I'm wondering, how long did you stay in that role on the medical 
floor? It sounds like that's one of the times that you ended up quitting. Is that right? 
  
[29:31] BF: It is. It is. That ward was Six Eight East. I worked there until 1983, so I was only there for 
three years, and then I went to the U of M and worked for a year and a half on the oncology ward, 
worked on Masonic three, which was a leukemic lymphoma patient population. I loved it, but I was 
really, really bored there, 'cause that was textbook nursing. On the day shift, I would have three patients. 
On the evening shift, I might have four to six, and on the night shift, never more than six to eight. 
Coming from the VA where, days, I'd have six to eight and if somebody got discharged, I'd get another 
admission, and my days just flew, at the U I was literally done with my work, including my charting, 
about three hours into my shift. It was good because that's when I met my husband, so we were dating 
and planning a wedding and buying a house and all that kind of stuff, but shortly after that, I quit that 
job at the U. I say I quit at the VA, but I actually stayed there on what's called intermittent status. I don't 
know if you've talked to anybody else who's done that, but basically, they would call me and if I was 
able to come in and work a shift, I would, but I was still working at the U. There was one year where I 
literally worked two shifts at the VA the entire year. Then I came back to the VA, and I came back to 
full-time, I want to say in 1986. There were three years where I was just kind of part-time and 
intermittent, and then when I came back, I got a job on the rehab ward, where I had worked as a nursing 
assistant, and that led to other jobs. I worked rehab for maybe a year, then I went to the float pool, then I 
worked for a number of years on-- it was called SDTU. It was Special Diagnostic and Testing Unit. That 
was a research ward. That's one of the things that might be a little bit different. It's definitely different 
than private sector. Over the years, I think one of the things that has really amazed me about the VA-- 
because as we all know, there's just the public perception out there that the VA is a public hospital and 
patients aren't going to get good care, it's disorganized, it's blah, blah, blah, but actually, the patients do 
get really good care. I know that there's a difference between VA's around the country, but the 
Minneapolis VA really enjoys a high level of patient satisfaction, and I think the patients really get a 
high level of quality care. In part, the VA does attract some really talented physicians - they support 
research - and I think that's probably the only draw for a physician to work at the VA is if they're into 
research, because the VA does support it so much. As staff, we get to enjoy the benefits of what they've 
learned. It's a good place to work. 
  
AG: Yeah, it sounds like they're really cutting edge in terms of both medical advances, but also kind of 
innovations in patient care, in trying to at least address the issues that veteran patients might specifically 
have. As you said, it could be-- 
  
BF: Right. 
  
AG: [Unintelligible], depending on where in the country you are but the entity-- 
  
BF: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

AG: In that research floor, how long were you there? 
  
[34:37] BF: I was there for quite a while. I'm trying to remember back, 'cause we have four kids, so a bit 
of what I've done, kind of I have to go, "Oh yeah. Did I have two kids then or did I have three?” My kids 
were pretty close together. We got married in 1984, our daughter was born in '86, our son in '87, our 
third daughter in '89, our third child, second daughter '89, and then our fourth, my second son, was born 
in '97. The Minneapolis VA built a new medical center, moved out of the old building and into the new 
in 1987. When I had my kids, I would cut back on my hours or take some time off for maternity leave. 
When my son was born in 1987, I quit again because I didn't wanna work as a mom. I was gonna stay 
home and raise my family. My husband ended up getting laid off each time. Each time I got pregnant, he 
got laid off. In '86, he got laid off. In '88 after our son was born, he got laid off and I had quit my job at 
the VA and taken out my retirement, and so I got a job working just for a couple months in a family 
practice, a clinic. Didn't make enough money there with him not working, so then I worked for two 
months at a nursing home that had a focus of rehab. I was familiar with rehab, I liked it, but it was a 
terrible place. I couldn't keep working-- We got good care, but it was kind of my insight into what 
private facilities looked like. This place didn't take Medicare. It kind of focused on the wealthier people. 
They charged a lot for the care that these people got, but they didn't pay the staff well enough to keep 
them, so there was a lot of pool personnel that would come in, and as a charge nurse, I ended up working 
with a lot of staff that I just didn't know. I knew that the patients weren't getting the quality of care that 
the families thought they were getting, and I just couldn't stay there. So, I called up the VA and talked to 
the nurse recruiter and said, "Do you have any openings in the float pool?" and she said, "When can you 
start?" and I said, "I can be there on Monday." So, I came back to the VA. That was in 1988, and I've 
stayed there ever since. I came in the float pool for a couple of years. My daughter was born then, so I 
was part-time then and my focus was more on my kids. Being in the float pool, I could go to the medical 
wards, the surgical wards. That was primarily where they would have the float pool people work. I was 
working maybe three days a week at that time. Then when I came back to work full-time, I was on that 
Special Diagnostic and Testing Unit, and I want to say that I stayed there for about 10 years. It was a 
small unit; it was a 10-bed unit. On day shift, we would have maybe three or four nurses, and on the 
evening shift and on the night shift, there was one nurse, but not a lot of what we needed to do happened 
on the evening or night shift. We had patients who were admitted for diabetic diet studies. They would 
get serial glucose tolerance tests based-- They'd get a baseline blood draw and then they would get the 
test meal. The researchers were trying to figure out what kinds of meals diabetic patients should eat. 
This was between 1990 and 1999. We also would do blood pressure studies. Those were mostly just 
recording vital signs with different formulations of medications. The researchers did the brain work. As 
a nurse, I just had to be very meticulous about following the protocols for doing the blood pressures or 
just recording, whatever. For the diabetic diet studies, it was the serial blood draws, but then we would 
have to process the bloods as well, so, kind of doing some lab work with that. For me, it was fascinating, 
and it helped me get really comfortable with just literally chatting with patients, 'cause these were 
normal healthy volunteers, or they maybe had diabetes, but they had to be pretty healthy to qualify for 
the research that they were doing. I worked there for about 10 years, and I really, really enjoyed that job. 
It was nice, 'cause my kids were little and I didn't have any heart wrenching stories of tragic things that 
patients were going through. I was literally taking care of healthy people. 
  
AG: Right, it sounds like, especially with young kids, four young kids, it was probably ideal to not have 
a whole nother level of emotional trauma at work.

BF: Pretty much, and it was great, 'cause I felt like what we were doing was important. It kinda opened 
my eyes to encouraging other people to go into nursing. You can do anything in nursing. You can 
choose any level of education you want. There's LPN's who get one to two years of schooling before 
they start, and then there's people who go all the way to getting their doctorates as nurse practitioners. 
You can work in mental health, you can work in peds, you can work in-- Basically, anybody in any 
situation in their life can use a nurse. It's a great job. 
  
AG: Really is. And like you said, the studies, it sounds like, on diabetes and glucose levels and blood 
pressure, I imagine that all of that information has made its way into some of the eating trends that I'm 
familiar with. 
  
BF: Oh, yeah. 
  
AG: When I was younger, everyone was very focused on not consuming fat, but then it shifted, you 
know-- 
  
BF: Right. 
  
AG: Managing your glucose and your insulin, and so I'm sure [unintelligible]. 
  
[43:08] BF: Yeah, yeah. We did have a program where there was a GI doctor who was looking at 
different levels of cholesterol. He was bringing in patients for 12 weeks at a time for a diet study, which 
was, like, who has 12 weeks where they can just walk away from their life, stay at a hospital and go 
home for a couple of weeks to clean out and then come back for three more months? Those patients 
were kinda interesting to get to know. They literally were there to eat and let us watch their weight and 
draw their labs. I don't remember a whole lot about the diet. I just remember for the cholesterol portion 
was they had to eat a lot of eggs. They got paid for their time. It wasn't a huge amount of money. I 
remember one guy who kinda needed to turn his life around. He was a young guy and he had been living 
at the Vets' home, which-- that's a whole different world. He was using the stipend that he got from 
participating in this study to kind of reinvent his life. He was an artist and he had stopped drinking, so he 
wasn't spending money on alcohol anymore, but he needed a down payment for an apartment. That was 
his motivation for being a participant in this study. It was kind of fun to get to see him succeed. He did 
use that money to get a down payment and get out of the Vets' home. The Vets' homes are state-run 
instead of federal, so they're different in each state. In Minnesota, they basically take 80 or 90% of what 
they make as payment for their living there. They don't really have a lot of expenses, so they get 10%. 
But, if you want to get out of there, it takes a lot of time to save up 10% of your income to get a down 
payment for an apartment. For him to use that, to watch him-- ‘cause he would come back and visit 
every once in a while over the next couple of years. It was a stepping stone for him, and the research 
was great for the physician. So, that was a little bit different. I would go home after my shift and think, 
"I can't believe they pay me to do this. This is great." They paid me well to do it, so it was good. 
  
AG: Yeah, it sounds like it must have been perfectly suited for that time in your life as well. When you 
left that role, what made you decide to switch roles?

BF: That is a good story. I did not want to leave that job. It was a great job. One of the study 
coordinators came up to me and she said, "There's a job in a clinic that you want. The nurse is leaving, 
and you want her position." It was actually in the HIV clinic. Some of the research that we did also 
involved HIV care, and I had met a couple of the patients and kind of enjoyed getting to know them. 
This was in mid- to late 90s, so it was pretty early on in the really effective antiretrovirals. I really liked 
what I was doing on the research ward, had no need to get a different job, and I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, I’ll 
think about it." She came back a week later. She goes, "Have you applied for that job yet?" I'm like, 
"No, I really like what I'm doing." She's like, "You want this job." "I don't think so." Another week later, 
she's like, "This opening is gonna close pretty soon. You want this job. You need to apply for this job." 
"Like, I really, really like what I'm doing." But I applied for the job, and I got to know the doctor 
because he would come up to the research ward. The study coordinator had told him that I was going to 
apply, and he said, "Really? She'd really work?" I felt kind of valued when I heard that. I was like, "Oh, 
so they do like what I do." The reason that I even applied for the job: it was the HIV clinic, in 
combination with working in oncology, which again, my first love and interest in nursing was oncology. 
I did apply for the job because it was also oncology. I don't know if you picked up on the fact, when I 
graduated from high school, I went to a year of Bible school because I wanted to figure out what I 
wanted to do with my life. I'm thinking, "HIV clinic," and I'm like a super conservative person. They're 
really not gonna like me. But, I got the job 'cause the doctor knew me from working on the research 
ward, the kind of work that I did. He hired me, told the oncology doctor who was also part of the hiring 
process. When I went in for my interview with her, she said, "Well, Joe," the name of the doctor, "Joe 
said I have to hire you, so what do you want to talk about, 'cause you pretty much have the job?" I was 
like, "Oh, okay. I guess my job is gonna change a little bit." I took the job in the HIV clinic. That was in 
1999, and I worked there until 2017. 
  
AG: Do you have a sense of why it was such a desirable job? It sounds like you were happy there, so it 
must have been interesting to stay for so many years. 
  
[50:42] BF: Right. I don't know. I think she just thought that I would be a good fit with the clinic staff. 
As a study coordinator, she got to talk to the patients, and so the patients said, I think, had probably gone 
back to her and said, "Yeah, there's a nurse up on fourth floor. She was really nice to us." The doctor's 
name was Joe, and he started working at the VA when I was still in the float pool. This was a time when, 
I don't know if you know much about the history of patients with HIV, but when they would come into 
the hospital, people were still very afraid of them. They put on gowns and gloves and goggles and 
masks, which, now with Coronavirus, we're all like, "Yeah, so what?" but at the time, I don't even really 
remember putting on gloves to do personal care for patients. We'd clean up a mess and we'd just wash 
our hands really good afterwards. The patients were used to staff being very barriered up when they 
would come and talk to them, and I think when they were on the research ward, they kind of expected 
that as well. I just talked to 'em like they were normal people, and I think that that didn't happen a lot in 
the medical community for them, and it certainly didn't happen with their families. At the time, I didn't 
know that, but after working in the clinic for a number of years, I kind of figured that out. They would 
talk about some of the hard things with their families. 'Cause military, it wasn't okay to be gay. A lot of 
them joined the military to prove to their families that they were guys, that they weren't effeminate or 
whatever. They joined because they had something to prove, I guess. I just got a thing on my screen 
again that says, “Reconnect.” Is it still coming through okay? 
  
AG: Yeah, we can hear you great. There hasn't been any breakup.

BF: Okay, I'll just hit, “Ignore”. 
  
AG: Okay. 
  
BF: Okay, alright. I think it worked in the HIV clinic-- The study nurse went back to Joe and said, "I'll 
really push to get Beverly to work in the clinic to replace Ann," and since he knew me from my role in 
research, he was comfortable with the kind of work that I did and saw that it would be a good fit for his 
patients. It's like I was saying, the patients were used to people being barriered up, and when I was in the 
float pool, I kind of hated having to take care of a patient with HIV because, collectively, they just 
seemed very angry. After working in the clinic, it was like, oh, of course they were angry. They were 
dying and nobody was touching them. They were creepy. They were whatever. Their lifestyles were 
bad. "You didn't get HIV by being an upstanding upright person," was kind of the perception out there, 
and people were kind of angry at having to take care of them. So of course, the patients would be angry 
too, but they were scared. After Joe started working with them, that attitude in our patients, the VA, HIV 
patients, really changed, because they knew they had an advocate in him. He was knowledgeable, he 
was compassionate, and they knew that if something wasn't right with their care, he would advocate for 
them and make it right. He gave them hope. He'd say, "There's medications. We can work with this. You 
work with me and I'll work with you." He really respected them. After I got the job in the clinic, I really 
picked up on that and just kind of offered that human side of it. When I'd take their blood pressure and 
temperature, I didn't put gloves on to touch their skin, and they'd kind of go, “Why aren't you wearing 
gloves?” and I’m like, “Because I'm not exposed to any blood or body fluids.” It was just kind of 
bringing a sense of normalcy to their care, making their care routine and kind of encouraging them to 
take their medications. 
  
AG: What was your day-to-day role like in the clinic? What kinds of things did you do? 
  
[56:48] BF: My supervisors trusted me to do my job. I didn't have a lot of oversight or even direction, 
and the nurse that I was replacing had actually left the job by the time I got into the position. It was six 
months that they hadn't had a nurse in the clinic, and so I basically kinda got to write my own role with 
it. I didn't know what I was supposed to do, so I just did what I thought I should do. We had clinic 
Monday and Friday mornings, Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, so when there were patients in clinic, I 
would check them in, do the routine. The ward clerk would greet the patient, let me know that they were 
there, then I would bring them into a room, check their temperature, blood pressure, weight, kind of go 
over basic medication information, just kind of like you would for any check-in appointment with a 
doctor. I should back up a little bit. When I started in clinic, there were roughly just under 100 patients. 
It was called the MRTC Clinic, Minneapolis Retrovirus Treatment Clinic. We had right about 100 
patients. The morning slots, I think we had a max of seven or eight, so it's not like I was taking care of a 
ton of patients at any given day. Each patient was scheduled for a half-hour appointment, and I do my 
check in before that. Our doctor was notoriously slow, maybe. He gave patients a lot of time. Let's put it 
that way. So, I knew that I had easily half an hour with a patient to do their check-in. You can do vitals 
and go over their meds in five minutes, but I would talk to them about a lot of other things. They had a 
lot of fear, they had a lot of disappointments. A lot of families had basically written them off, like, 
[unintelligible], "Yeah, my dad won't have anything to do with me because I'm gay," or they'd talk about 
so much. I remember one guy who came into clinic. I just looked him up the other day. He was 42 when 
he died. He died three months after I started in that job, so he died in December of '99. He came into

clinic one morning. He was doing pretty much just fine, but I'm doing his blood pressure and his weight 
was down just a tiny bit. He said, "I don't know. My stomach just feels kind of full and my clothes are 
fitting kinda tight," even though he'd lost weight. Basically, I knew that his liver was getting bigger, and 
I just kind of had this sense of dread. When Joe looked at him, he was like, "Yeah, we're gonna admit 
him." This guy came into the hospital and that was the last time that he was home. He came from home 
to a clinic appointment, got admitted to the hospital, and died a couple of months later. Because he was 
in the hospital, I did meet his parents. His parents were great, but I guess-- I did get to talk to this guy a 
lot. He'd known probably from junior high that he was different, that he was not attracted to women. He 
knew that that meant he was gay, of course, at a time when nobody really talked about it. He didn't have 
a lot of support at all. He was one of those who went into the military to prove that he was normal, and 
after he got out, got HIV. His parents were still supportive of him, but he didn't have a lot of other 
people. He was in a really bad relationship, didn't really understand why he stayed in that relationship. 
He would talk about the fact that one of his biggest regrets was the fact that with this lifestyle, he would 
never give his parents grandchildren. For me at that time, it was just kind of, "Oh, yeah. He didn't 
choose to be gay. He just is gay." That was kind of enlightening for me, and just kinda helped me accept 
our patients for who they were and treat them for who they were. Just kind of when they would come 
into clinic, "It sounds like you're partying a lot on the weekends. How does that look if you have to take 
your medications? Do you bring your medications with you? Do you talk about having HIV? Do other 
people know? How do you bring that up, if you see your relationship is getting stronger?" or whatever. 
It was good to be able to have time to spend with patients like that. This would all happen just in the 
span of a half-hour appointment, just kind of encouraging them to continue making the changes that they 
were making. I felt like I was able to impact them in a positive, no pun-intended, way, and they would 
often say that. They were very open about what was going on with them, and they were also very aware 
of the fact that their medications were expensive. They were glad that they didn't have to pay for them. 
They knew that Dr. Thurn was knowledgeable, that he cared and that he would really work hard for 
them to get the best care that they could get. One of the patients, I remember talking with him. He was a 
really strong advocate not only for HIV, but just for gay rights and stuff. One of his jobs was bringing 
around the magazines to different clinics and different locations. He said that he was really, really happy 
with his care in the private sector, and was very discouraged when he realized that financially, he 
couldn't keep working; he wasn't gonna have insurance. He was glad that he was a vet because he could 
go to the VA, but he was also disappointed that he had sunk to the level of needing to come to the VA. 
Here he was at the VA and his first appointment with Doctor Thurn, and he said, "I knew I was getting 
good care before I came to the VA. At that first appointment, I realized that I had not been getting the 
best care I could." In his first physical, he said, "Dr. Thurn looked in my eyes, looked in my ears, looked 
in my mouth, listened to my chest. Nobody had touched me in the previous five years," and said, "I 
knew then that I should have been coming to the VA a lot longer than I had been." That was kind of the 
experience of a lot of our patients. These young guys who were working full-time jobs had insurance, 
and then because they had HIV, they were no longer able to work full-time, they'd been quit by their 
jobs or their jobs had left. Then they'd come to the VA and when they realized that they were gonna get 
good care, they kind of relaxed and they would be very open and honest with us about a lot of things. It 
was a good job. 
  
AG: It sounds like it was really very rewarding, like there were a lot of rewarding aspects and also must 
have, I imagine, been emotionally draining too to be so, especially during that period of time, to be so in 
the thick of it in terms of HIV care and treatment. When you think back, do you think that you have a 
different perspective on the veteran patient population or on the VA as a whole, given how much time

you spent in the HIV clinic versus had you stayed on a medical or surgical floor or in the float pool? Do 
you think it shifted your impression of the hospital system? 
  
[1:08:02] BF: I don't know that it shifted my impression of it. I just remember being so, so grateful that I 
had time to spend with the patients. I think I mentioned when I started working in the clinic, there were 
just under 100 patients, and by 2017, we were following about 200, 250. I got to see a lot of people who 
were newly diagnosed. Maybe 50 of those were newly diagnosed in that span of time, and the others 
transitioned in from outside, either other VA's around the country or from local because their insurance 
stopped. I think, again, it just made me really grateful that we didn't charge patients for their care. Right 
around the time-- So, 2017 we were just starting to do PREP, which is pre-exposure prophylaxis, so, 
giving people HIV medications who don't have HIV to prevent getting it, based on lifestyle. I was not 
ready to be done working in clinic, but things changed in the hospital and the HIV clinic was moved to a 
different area. I was working essentially full-time. I'd mentioned that it was the HIV clinic with 
oncology, so my oncology commitment was one day a week, and I would give chemotherapy on 
Wednesdays, because we didn't have the HIV clinic on Wednesdays. Then things transitioned in the 
oncology clinic, and my role with them changed, even though I stayed with it. The HIV clinic moved to 
a different area, and I was given the option of moving with the clinic but only being involved one day a 
week. They were just gonna just give me that amount of time for the patients, or I could stay where I 
was and increase my oncology time. I, in my mind, could not figure out how I could cut back that much 
in the HIV clinic, 'cause at that point, it was essentially all I was doing. I really wasn't doing much with 
oncology, and I couldn't figure out how I could cut back staying in that role without-- I just couldn't do 
it, couldn't do what I did in one day a week, and then pick up other stuff that was not defined. It was 
like, "Well, we'll find stuff for you to do, but you're only going to be HIV one day a week," so I opted to 
stay with the oncology portion of it. Does that make sense? 
  
AG: Yes, that does make sense. Is that what you're currently doing? Are you still working oncology? 
  
BF: Now I am 100% oncology. Well, that's not true. I'm oncology and infectious disease. I don't do the 
HIV portion of infectious disease anymore, but I do follow the patients who are on latent TB infection 
treatment and I follow the patients who are on home IV antibiotics. That's an area that's really grown 
over the years. I think I mentioned when I first started working at the VA and I was on medicine, our 
patients would get admitted for colonoscopies and heart caths, and those now are outpatient procedures, 
so, a four-day admission down to three hours in the hospital and you're out. With the home IV 
antibiotics, that is something that has definitely changed over the years. I think I also mentioned on the 
medicine ward, we would give patients their antibiotics up to every four hours, and those patients were 
sick, or they were pretty intense. Now, those patients give themselves their antibiotics at home. The 
antibiotics have changed a bit, the stronger second, third generations of them where you don't need to 
give 'em every four hours anymore. You can give 'em every eight hours or even every 24 hours. If that's 
really the only care that they're getting in the hospital, why not do it at home? We contract with outside 
agencies. There are a number of them: Gorum is one, Option Care is one, [unintelligible] Science is one. 
The VA pays for the care but then the patients are at home, giving themselves the antibiotics, with a 
nurse going in once a week to draw labs and change the dressing on their PICC lines or whatever they've 
got. Then it's my job to make sure that those labs get done, that the patients are doing okay. I call, let 'em 
know what their lab results are, and I make sure that the doctors get the results and track them that way. 
People will be on antibiotics, maybe, at home for a week or up to 12 weeks typically. I have one patient 
right now who's actually been on IV antibiotics since October 9th. He's getting them because he is also 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
 
 
 
 
2020012 
Nursing America’s Veterans

getting chemotherapy at an outside hospital, but because his immune system is kind of crummy and he's 
got all sorts of stuff going on. They're keeping the antibiotics going just so that he doesn't get a recurrent 
infection. He's kind of the exception to the rule but, like I said, most people are on anywhere from one to 
12 weeks. 
  
AG: So, is it concurrent with chemotherapy or is it for TB, or it could be any number of diagnoses that 
require at-home antibiotics? 
  
[1:15:44] BF: They are kind of anything there, whatever infectious disease. Usually, it's started in the 
hospital, maybe 10% of the time. The ID physician will see a patient in clinic, identify something that 
needs an IV antibiotic, then we make arrangements for them to get a PICC placed as an outpatient, get a 
test dose, and then they can go home and be taught how to administer it themselves. But it can be for 
anything. Common diagnoses are, like, the 12-week ones are often people who've had knee-- usually it's 
knee replacements. Occasionally, it's hip replacements where the joint will become infected, and they'll 
try to do the antibiotics to save the artificial joint. Sometimes they just have to get the joint out and they 
still have to get the antibiotics. Those are usually the longer ones. Then there's bacteremia or sepsis. 
Those are kind of the most common ones. Sometimes it's a urinary tract infection. Those are a little 
more rare, maybe 10% of the time. It's kind of a smattering of anything or everything. The latent TB 
patients are totally different. Those are an oral medication, and they'll be on it anywhere from three 
months, four months to nine months. It's a nurse following just to make sure that they're taking their 
medications and not having any side effects from them. 
  
LK: This has been absolutely fascinating. Can we speak a bit about the COVID-19 pandemic and how it 
may have affected you and your patients? 
  
BF: [Laughs] Yeah, that was a whole different chapter. By this point, I had transitioned to mostly 
oncology. The infectious disease portion, all of that work for me is done on the phone, contacting 
patients by phone. Rarely, rarely do I see them in person. An appointment with them, maybe if they had 
an appointment elsewhere in the medical center. The COVID piece for infectious disease really was only 
impacted because there were fewer patients coming to the medical center. For infectious disease, if 
patients aren't being seen, they don't get referrals, so, a lot of it for them was following patients who 
were already established in care. The HIV piece, I think, didn't change a whole lot. My COVID 
experience was more with the oncology patients, so I can speak a little bit to that. These are patients who 
are getting chemotherapy, and my role in the clinic is split a little bit, but a big portion of what I do is 
following patients who are on oral chemotherapy who just need monthly lab follow up to make sure that 
their counts are staying in a decent range and that they're not having any side effects. One thing that's 
kind of interesting with the oral chemo cancer patients, they almost never miss their medications 
[laughs]. The HIV guys, it was kind of a challenge to convince them that they needed to take their 
medications to not develop resistance or for the medications to keep working. The oncology patients, it's 
kind of like,"I have cancer. I'm going to do everything I can to make this cancer go away." Medication 
compliance is typically not much of an issue. Their issue is more that they get their medication on time 
from pharmacies so that they don't run out, 'cause they really feel like if they miss a dose, their cancer is 
gonna just take over, so they're really good about taking their medications. The other piece that I do is 
following patients whose counts do drop because of their chemotherapy. They might be getting weekly 
labs or twice weekly labs to see if their hemoglobin is staying up, or if they've got other side effects. 
Typically, it's just making arrangements for a blood transfusion if their hemoglobin drops because of

their chemotherapy, or getting platelets because that dropped. Those patients are coming for their 
chemo, but they know that their counts have dropped, so their immune systems are not great. They were 
very fearful of coming to the medical center, because the perception out there was that hospitals were 
just hotbeds of COVID germs, and just walking through the door they would get COVID. I really was 
very happy with how our medical center kept staff aware of what was being done in the facility to 
protect both staff and patients. Because I was talking to patients on the phone or their significant others, 
it was very easy for me to encourage them to come. Say, "On your end, you do your part. You wear your 
mask, you wash your hands, you stay away from sick people,” but they were already doing that. Then I 
would be able to tell them when they got to the medical center they had one entrance that they could go 
in. We for the most part could give the screeners at the entrance a list of our patients, and we would call 
them the day before and see if they were bringing someone with them, because oftentimes, the oncology 
patients would need assistance in the building, either pushing them by wheelchair to appointments or 
just being a second set of ears to hear their instructions and remind them what they needed to do. We 
were actually able to have visitors with our patients, and I know that was not the same in other clinics. If 
it was an ortho patient, they didn't necessarily have the advantage of having somebody with them. Our 
medical center uses a lot of volunteers to help transport patients in the medical center from one area to 
another, and during COVID, I know that there were a lot fewer volunteers. I think they've shut down the 
volunteers, but I can be a little bit myopic and not really pay attention to what's going on in other 
departments. For my job, I basically sit all day in an office with no windows and just the one door to the 
hallway that is in the clinic, so I don't really see what's going on in the rest of the building. A lot of my 
job, especially last summer, was just convincing family members that it was safe in the building. Does 
that make sense? 
  
LK: It absolutely does. Do you think that the way that the hospital dealt with COVID, the protocols, 
things like that, do you think it's the same in other VA hospitals? How else do you think the pandemic 
has impacted health care in the VA? 
  
[1:25:19] BF: One of the things that I really appreciated was the-- and I'm terrible with titles. The 
Director for the Undersecretary of Health, I think. His name was Richard Stone. Early on in the 
pandemic, he started sending out weekly updates, just very encouraging messages. I know a lot of staff 
didn't listen to them, but I found him incredibly encouraging. He would talk about the COVID numbers 
around the nation in the VA and what the VA was doing to protect staff, to support staff. He did a lot at 
the national level to empower each facility to do what they needed to do. I don't really know how much 
of what happens in the VA is controlled at the national level. I know that we have rules and things that 
we have to follow, but during this, it seemed like a lot of the constraints that are put on each facility 
were removed. It's like, you need to do what is best on the recommendations in your area. We needed to 
be fluid with how we responded, and he gave each facility the ability to do that, and then had regular 
meetings with leadership staff: "What's working in your area? Can we spread this to other VA's?" We 
had that going for us. It also made it possible for areas that were more hard hit to get VA staff from 
areas that were less hit. So, like if Minneapolis didn't have a lot going on, we could send staff to New 
York or to Texas. It was like there was really a connection. I was more aware in the last year of the VA 
broader community than I ever have been in the last 40 years. He was very encouraging, but then he 
would also get on and kind of highlight different departments, like what was happening nationally on a 
logistics level. He's like, "Okay, here is where our supply chain is. This is why we have this equipment. 
This is why other areas don't have this equipment," or, "why we don't have this here, but they do have it 
there." He could just kind of move stuff around to where it needed to be when it needed to be there.

Same thing happened with the hurricanes or other stuff. There's been so much in the last year and I can't 
remember where all the areas were, but like the flooding in Georgia and how they were able to just make 
decisions in the moment that needed to happen to get patients and staff to safer areas. Just on a national 
level, VA was supported by leadership. Then, he'd highlight these different areas and kind of praise the 
leadership and kind of just encourage people with, "You can be proud of what we're doing." That was 
really good. Then as far as vaccines, once they were approved for emergency use, VA is-- I don't know. 
I think we've probably enjoyed being able to get equipment-- and because we have a lot of research 
supported, all of this stuff that needed to happen for the COVID vaccines was already in place. Because 
it was the military that was kind of sending it out initially, VA knows how to work with military and 
they have that infrastructure was already there. The freezers that they needed, they could get those to 
where they needed to be, and then as far as setting up the vaccine clinics, staff was vaccinated first. I 
know that they started with frontline staff, I assume in every facility, but I know in Minneapolis, the 
frontline staff was vaccinated first. We started right around Thanksgiving getting vaccinations to staff so 
they would get their second dose of Pfizer even before Christmas. I know I got my first one before 
Christmas, my second one early January. The rollout for patients was pretty smooth and seamless. Our 
call center got a lot of phone calls with patients wanting the vaccine and, "When am I gonna get it?" As 
we got our shipments, we could contact patients and the patients who were scheduled for vaccines. 
'Cause I was calling 'em for their labs and stuff, I'd say, "Well, how'd it go when you got your COVID 
shot?" and they'd go, "It was so cool. It was so organized," 'cause they'd have to have pharmacy drawing 
it up. It's very regimented as far as how long the vaccine was stable out of the freezer, so it was very, 
very organized and very scheduled, which, human nature isn't necessarily that great at that kind of 
scheduling, but I was thrilled with how the VA rolled it out, and patients were-- other than the fact that 
they had to wait their turn. The people over 80 and then it was people over 70 and people with these 
conditions and stuff. Those initial, no walk-in appointments, people were a little bit unhappy with that 
but they understood it. I think the news did a good enough job that, "Your turn will come." I think 
people did realize that that would happen. It didn't happen fast enough for some of 'em, as far as that 
goes, but that's just kind of what had to happen. 
  
LK: How do you think the pandemic has impacted healthcare in the US generally? 
  
[1:33:03] BF: That would be something I've not really kept abreast of. It's been enough to just be upset 
about it. I am really tired of wearing a mask in the building, and I kinda get stuck on that. It's like, "Oh, I 
just--" I don't have a good sense of what's happened in other facilities. What we were doing initially-- I 
want to say in the medical center, we were getting daily updates, but I am not sure that that's true. It may 
have been twice a week. Already, it's a little fuzzy in my memory. I'd kind of watch those numbers and 
we'd get the testing data, so we knew how many patients were getting tested every day, we knew how 
many staff were getting tested every day, we knew how many positives that were in our system that had 
been tested, and we knew how many inpatients we had. As far as personally, like I said, I started in the 
HIV clinic in '99, so 22 years I've been in the clinic and not working on the floors. They called it re-up 
training, so the clinic nurses had to spend a day of orientation on the wards again to kind of, "If we need 
you on the wards, this is what you'll be doing." They were gonna have us not necessarily take a regular 
assignment, but just be highly trained staff to assist with patients. We had our intensive care. Over the 
years, health care has changed enough that our medical intensive care unit was closed, and the step 
down units were able to do most of the care that patients would have gotten in intensive care on a 
medicine ward. They reopened the intensive care unit for the sickest of the COVID patients. Then we 
have an entire medical ward, just a medical unit, it's called 3E, that was recently remodeled, so it's all

2020012

single-bed rooms and there's no centralized nursing station. The nurses can chart just outside the 
patient's room. Then for a work room, it's kind of behind some closed doors. They were able to retrofit 
that so the entire unit was negative pressure. I want to say there are 22 beds on that, so we had 22 
negative pressure beds for patients and in the ICU area. Any COVID patient that came in would go to 
one of those two areas. The staff were all given the better face masks. We all understood that they were 
needing to be as protected as possible, 'cause they were spending literally their entire shift in a COVID 
hotbed. Any patient who needed to get admitted for our clinic, they could come to clinic, but if they 
were getting admitted to the hospital, we had to do a rapid COVID test to get their COVID result before 
they could be admitted to the ward, and any patient that got admitted to the hospital had to be COVID 
tested so they would get to the appropriate area. That for me was kind of amazing. It's like, wow, we get 
this test result in an hour, and they were pretty confident with the results that they got from those. I was 
amazed that the testing was that quick and it was developed as fast as it was. I'm thinking, 20 years ago, 
none of that would have been possible. In fact, when I was in nursing school, I had a friend who worked 
for the Chicago Fire Department as a paramedic, and he was talking about glucose testing. He goes, 
"And they can get the result in five minutes," and I was like, "Wow, that's crazy." I think now we can get 
a glucose test result in five seconds. People do it in their homes. It's not medical professionals who need 
to do that, so I just think that we're very fortunate with all of the advances that have happened in 
medicine, and had those things not been in place, COVID would have been so much worse than it was. 
It was bad enough, but we've learned a lot about disease, we've learned a lot about transmission, and 
we've learned a lot about testing and we've learned a lot about prevention. 
  
LK: Are there any lessons from the COVID-19 response that you'd like to share? 
  
BF: Probably not [laughs]. It's kinda not my forte [laughs]. 
  
LK: Okay. 
  
BF: [Unintelligible] that people need to be aware of their own actions and their own role in living in 
community. 
  
LK: Alright, so the next question is, what do you see as your role in providing patient care, and has that 
changed over the course of your career? 
  
[1:40:11] BF: Yeah, yeah. I used to think that patients heard every word I said and they believed 
everything I told them. I do think that people that I interact with do sense that my interactions with them 
are honest. I think they believe that I am telling them what I believe to be the truth, but I am humble 
enough to know that more what they will hear is my intention, and know that I genuinely care about 
them and how their health is impacting their life. Maybe, because typically, cancer is a pretty serious 
diagnosis. If unchecked, usually will kill someone if they don't treat it. I think what's really impacted me 
the most is how much they care about their families and how their actions, their responses to treatment, 
create a legacy. I've heard a number of them talk about that, how they want to be a good example to their 
kids, or they want to make it to their granddaughter's wedding or they want to do this, they have a goal. 
When I ask them how that conversation goes with their family, if they've been able to have those hard 
conversations, most of them do but have needed encouragement to do it. It's like, "Do you really think 
your kids don't know what's going on? Are you able to address it with them? Are you able to let them

2020012

know that this is going to be the end of your life?" It's interesting to be able to encourage them to have 
those conversations that are not easy. 
  
LK: Wow, that's incredible. What services, if any, would you like to see provided or improved for 
veterans? 
  
BF: Boy. It's kind of funny, 'cause basically my whole career I've loved working for the VA, but I have 
always thought, you know, this is one of those things that's just too good to last. It's gonna change. The 
VA is gonna be the insurance provider instead of providing care. What I've been fearful of, if that were 
to happen, 'cause there's the MISSION Act and getting care closer to home, 'cause a lot of VA's do see 
patients who are 100 or 200 miles or more from the medical center, and in an emergency, that's a terrible 
situation. You really have to go locally, and then get the records transferred, which sometimes that 
happens really well, sometimes it doesn't happen very well. What scares me is if care transitions for 
patients to be seen locally, they lose the perspective of, "Might this be a military-related condition?" 
where you don't have providers who see a number of patients from the same era who have similar 
conditions and go, "Oh, that might be," and then kind of explore that further. I think down the road if 
care gets privatized and VA just becomes the insurance payer, that that piece will be lost. I see a lot of 
connections that patients make with other patients. Not necessarily that they form alliances, but I think 
as they share experiences, they get a lot out of that, and I think their shared experiences drive better care. 
Does that make sense? 
  
LK: That definitely makes sense, and your point about knowing whether something is connected to the 
military also makes a lot of sense. 
  
[1:45:57] BF: I think that's huge. It scares me to think that that might get lost. It scares me, maybe 
saddens me more. I say a lot of good things about the VA and I trust the VA. I trust our facility. If 
patients have a bad experience, I always recommend that they go to a patient advocate, 'cause I know 
those patient advocates do follow up and improve care. I say, "Things are not gonna get better for other 
patients if you don't speak up and tell what your experience was." I know that that's what happened with 
the HIV patients. If things were not good, they knew that they could let us know and we would make it 
right, and the same with the cancer patients. If they get a diagnosis and it seems to be taking a long time, 
just talking to them and saying, "Well, you have a slow growing cancer. Yeah, we need to do this, and 
it's gonna take time." But if they have leukemia, it's like, "No, you need to come into the hospital now. 
We need to deal with this. You will die if you don't come today." Somebody who has a much slower 
cancer, just kind of talking them down off that ledge and saying, "This is okay. This is appropriate." One 
of the biggest differences that I see between private care and VA care, [unintelligible] patients who are 
used to-- We get a lot of patients from Mayo who are like, "Oh, Mayo is great. It's been this, it's been 
that," but then they come to the VA and they're like, "Wait, you need what? I don't need that," which we 
just kind of go, "Well, in private care that is a moneymaker. You're getting way more testing than you 
need to have done.” Consequently, we'll have patients say, "I just had a PET scan three months ago. Do I 
really need another one?" I kind of look and say, "VA doesn't spend money on stuff that doesn't need to 
be spent on. If your doctor recommended this scan, it's because you need it, not because it would be nice 
to have or we can charge your insurance company. We're not going to make money on this. It's needed 
for your care, and you're worth it.” That, to me, is the biggest difference. We're not into health care for 
making money. We're in it to improve their lives.

LK: Absolutely. I mean, I guess another question, it's kind of a follow up, is: What's the hardest part of 
your job and what's the most rewarding part? 
  
BF: [Laughs] They're the same. The hardest part is working with patients who are dying and you know 
that they're dying, and the rewarding part is making it as smooth a transition and it is open and honest as 
it can be. I feel good at the end of my work day knowing that my job, my work is not lining the pockets 
of some executive who's going on great trips. It's honoring people who took care of us. 
  
LK: That's wonderful. Can I ask you some more questions, some more details about your day-to-day 
position? 
  
BF: Sure. 
  
LK: Do you like going to work? 
 
BF: I do, I do. I am 64, and there are not a lot of nurses who work at 64 [laughs]. I could have retired 
more than 10 years ago, but I enjoy my job, not every day, not every minute, but for the most part. I feel 
that the patients that I work with appreciate what I do for them. 
  
LK: Excellent. During the course of your shift, do you interact with a lot of technology, and what types? 
  
[1:51:11] BF: Computer, definitely. We do have video-voice connect that we can use. I choose not to, 
because most of what I do is easily done just by a phone conversation. Every once in a while it's 
challenging, 'cause, you know, somebody's cell phone reception isn't great, but... I use spreadsheets on 
my computer. We've got an Excel program. The VA is usually pretty good about any technology that we 
need, we can get that done. I think with research, if there are programs that are helpful or useful in 
research, typically the researcher will get funding in their research grants for any technology that they 
need, but if the system needs to support it, it's usually pretty easy to get. I know one of the infectious 
disease doctors was really excited about a program called Thera Doc, which is a super powerful search 
engine. It took him I think maybe two years to get approval for it to come in, but once it was there, then 
getting training, it was supported. I feel like we get pretty much everything that the private sector would 
get, like PET scans, any of that technology. I feel like the VA is good about getting medications when 
there are new medications that come on board. This happens at the national level. There's a review board 
and they'll get stuff. I only became aware of this because of being in the HIV clinic. When new 
medications were approved, I know that our physician could get them locally, get 'em on the formulary, 
so that we could give them to patients almost as soon as they were approved. I know that's a facility to 
facility thing, so, you have to have pharmacy staff who is engaged and willing to go the extra mile to get 
that to happen, and you have to have a physician who is gonna be onboard enough to be aware of what's 
new, what's coming down the pike. The same with cardiology or any of those interventions that 
cardiology would need to do. That's the thing that amazes me, 'cause the VA does not pay well. I just 
learned the other day that nobody in the VA can make more than the president. Our cardiologists and 
our oncologists are not making what they could in the private sector, but they stay at the VA either 
because they love what they do or their research is supported, or I don't really know what their 
motivation is but yeah, they usually are given what they need, the tools they need, to do their job. I know 
when I go to my own appointments, if I need to have an MRI or something, I can just be sitting in my 
appointment, the provider will make a call, I'll go to x-ray, and they'll do the MRI right then. It's like 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
 
 
 
 
2020012 
Nursing America’s Veterans 
22 
 
they've got staff waiting in the wings to do whatever needs to be done. The VA does not staff that way. 
Everything kind of needs to be scheduled. If an MRI needs to happen today, the provider can talk to the 
radiologist and make it happen, but if it's a, "Well, we'd like this within the next week or so," it's maybe 
not all that convenient. The patient may need to come back but it'll get done. We do have to be careful 
and cognizant, 'cause we're funded by taxpayers, so, we have to be careful with how we spend our 
money. They're not gonna just throw money at something that's not tried and true, but if it's tried and 
true and worth it, they're gonna get it. Maybe a Pollyanna kind of point of view on that, but I've been 
there long enough to see the system work well and I trust it. 
  
LK: Are there parts of the nursing process that you once did and are now done by machine or computer 
or another type of care provider? 
  
[1:57:04] BF: Certainly the tracking that I do using a spreadsheet. I still enter that all by hand. There's 
probably an easier or more reliable way to do it, but I personally don't. Then I think with the Thera Doc 
thing, I did take the training on that, 'cause when I was telling the guy who got it into our system about 
what I do, he goes, "Oh, this would be a great application for you!" I haven't figured out how to make 
that work for exactly what I do, but I know for the [unintelligible] section, that could identify some 
cancers that maybe aren't flagged to us. It could identify them sooner than we get them. Just as far as 
technology and the changes, I think being in the clinic, I don't see them quite as much as the floor nurses 
do. I know just the wireless technology, doing an EKG in clinic, we're getting new machines that will 
transmit wirelessly. Currently, we plug our system into the wall and the data port and have to select 
“Send” and then it eventually makes it into the record within maybe half an hour after it's done, but that 
used to take days. We do an EKG in clinic and then we'd have to send it to scanning and it would 
eventually get there. We have internet connection with other facilities, so if somebody gets labs drawn in 
a Mayo Clinic, say for example, I can connect through Joint Longitudinal View - it's called JLV - to get 
their lab results where, so I might send a lab order to a clinic - say we need a CBC with a differential and 
a CMP on this date - and then fax the results back to me, and if I don't get the faxed results back, I'll 
look on JLV and see if they had their labs drawn. That's made things quite a bit easier, and I expect that 
to improve over time. That said, the VA has a lot of security built into their system, which, I know for 
these recordings, people have said that they'd had issues with [unintelligible] to the VA. I think part of 
that is just due to the layer of security that they have. It's also impacted the quality of connections with 
some of their video appointments with patients, where a lot of providers will try to connect with the 
video, and then between their conversation with the patient and they'll just kind of jointly decide, "Yep, 
I've looked at you and now I'm just gonna finish it by phone." The technology, I think, will have to 
improve for that to be a smooth and seamless thing. However, I know the infectious disease doctors 
have been able to use it to do video appointments rather than face-to-face. During COVID, I don't think 
any of the ID providers saw any patients face-to-face. I think it was all video. If they had a wound that 
they were assessing, they could just have the patient put their camera phone right up to it and do it that 
way. That was pretty great during COVID. Other technology that I use, well, certainly the home IV 
antibiotics. Without technology and the changes that have happened over the years, that would not be 
possible. Administering IV fluids, when I first started, we would literally count the drips and go back 
half an hour later to make sure that our counts were on target. We'd mark the bags with tape and every 
hour where we expected that level to be. I know they don't do that anymore; that is all done by machine. 
Blood pressures, when I started, we were doing them manually. I know I was a student nurse tech when 
we got our first automated blood pressure machine. They had just taken it out of the box that day and I 
slapped it on one of the patients and, "I get to be the first one to use this machine in the whole building".

It was kinda fun. Now I'm like, people have automated blood pressure machines in their homes. So yeah, 
there've been a few changes over the years. 
  
LK: You've mentioned a few different types of software. Do you use any software to chart your 
patients? You said that you enter it manually. 
  
BF: That's just my spreadsheet. When I first started, in fact, when I first started in clinic, we were still 
using paper charts. The Minneapolis VA was one of the last VA’s in the country to go up with the 
electronic record, and our clinic was one of the last ones in the facility to go live with charting. CPRS is 
what we call it - Computer Patient Recording System or something like that. That is getting updated. 
They're working with Cerner, who has the contract for the DoD charting, with the goal that DoD records 
and VA records will be synchronous, but that rollout is going to take time. They started, I want to say, in 
Seattle. They went live this year, and so they're ironing out the glitches with the new medical record 
there. There's a book, I don't know if you've heard of it or if anybody else has mentioned it. It's called 
The Best Care Anywhere and it was written by a reporter who, at the time that he was commissioned to 
write an article for Forbes magazine, they contacted him and said, "We want to know about health care," 
kind of like the car industry and how that got turned around. They were hoping that he could write an 
article about the healthcare industry and how that was gonna be turned around. His wife at the time was 
getting cancer treatment at Johns Hopkins, and he'd say, "We’d walk in the building and we’d see these 
big posters all around, and we were just confident that she was getting great care.” He was starting this 
article, and all of his surveys came out with the VA patient satisfaction data being pretty high, which 
he's like, "That can't be right." In his research, what he found was because the VA had a computerized 
record system, it really increased the quality of care that patients received. They'd go to a specialty, 
those notes would be in there right away. You didn't have to wait days for people to get their charts 
together and stuff. It was because of the computerized records system that the quality of care had 
improved. They were able to track data on glucose levels for their diabetic patients. They were able to 
track data on their hypertension, responses to medications, stuff like that. It's a fascinating book to read. 
Basically, when the guy went back to Forbes with what his data was showing, what his article was 
gonna be, they were like, “Yeah, we're not interested in that." But he'd done enough research, he just 
decided to turn it into a book. I doubt many people outside of the VA have even purchased the book, but 
it was nice for us to see something on a national level that really supported what we were doing. If you 
get a chance to read it, it's worth it for the history of the VA. 
  
LK: Thank you. I just wrote that down for later. I'd love to read that book. 
  
BF: It's a quick read. You can read it in like an hour. 
  
LK: Wonderful. That sounds absolutely wonderful. What do you think of the charting process? 
  
BF: As far as changes over the years, or...? 
  
LK: Yeah, changes over the years, or how you've seen-- How does it help? How does it not help? 
  
[2:07:32] BF: I mentioned when I was in nursing school how kinda dismal it was to come to the VA. 
The student nurses would just think, "Oh, it's just so unorganized." We literally would have charts in 
manila folders that were five inches thick. You wanted to find something on neurology, you'd dig and 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
 
 
 
 
2020012 
Nursing America’s Veterans 
24 
 
dig and dig. Now I go to the computerized record and if I know what a neurology note title is called, I 
can just type, “find title,” and all the neurology notes will be highlighted for me. That's just made it so 
much easier. If a patient comes in and they say, "Well, the neurologist told me this," then I can look into 
the neurologist’s notes. I can find it literally in a matter of seconds and go, "Oh, okay. That's what they 
told you. Okay, this is what that means." I can kind of help explain stuff like that. Then if I need to look 
back and see what I wrote on a patient, or, like I mentioned, I was in the HIV clinic until 2017. Now, the 
doctor that I worked with just retired a year ago, and the new providers that are in clinic working with 
those patients now, since they're infectious disease, I still work with them, but they have commented on 
just how valuable those notes are, not only to read a history of the patient and the care that they've 
received, but to just kinda get a history on HIV in general. His notes were really thorough, my notes 
were very thorough, and they've been able to learn a lot, get a lot of insight about the patient and just 
about care in general. I would assume the same holds true for cardiology, for GI, for any specialty. You 
can learn so much from reading those notes. Was that kinda what you're looking for? 
  
LK: Definitely. I also have some questions about how long it takes you to complete your personal 
charting process, and when you do your charting. 
  
BF: That really varies. For my HEMOC stuff, I've created a case management template, which is just 
kind of a generic thing. The title would be HEMOC Case Management, and then the first line would be 
the case management date and physician's name, 'cause there are eight physicians in our section. Then 
the next line would be the patient's diagnosis. The next line is my actual case management order, 'cause 
I, as an RN, should not be directing patient care. That needs to be a physician. Then the next line is 
whether I contacted the patient or met with the patient. The next line, I click for lab results, which, if 
they're done in the VA, then those slave right into my notes. If they're done outside, then I manually 
enter those. My coworker just is able to get them to slave from another system. I don't do that, because if 
I manually enter them then I get the trend. If she puts them in, she just gets that day's capture. Our 
providers, when they're looking at labs, can select the trend, and I know in oncology that that's kind of 
important for them, so rather than having them go back and look through the last 10 notes, they can just 
see the last 10 lab results the way I put it in. Then my next line is patient concerns or questions and that I 
free type in, what my conversation with the patient was. Then I can select what their next clinic date is, 
the next blood draw. Then with patient satisfaction, if they were satisfied with the information or if they 
had more questions, or if there was any follow up that the doctor needs. I typically will do those. 
Typically, I'll call a patient, go over their lab results, go over their next appointments, kind of the next 
plan of care, see if they have any issues, concerns. My conversations with them could be anywhere from 
five minutes to 45 minutes. Then when I'm done, I just record what the conversation was and co-sign the 
physician to it. My charting actually will only take usually five minutes at the most. 
  
LK: That's absolutely wonderful. I know that there's kind of a trend in nursing that there tends to be a lot 
of time charting. It's wonderful to hear that you take that time to talk to your patients. 
  
BF: Yeah, I know. It used to take me a lot longer to chart, but I do see the value of charting. I know 
when I look at the notes, if I've gotten impatient and I read the nursing notes, I'm just like, "Oh, 
seriously. Do you guys really have to do that every shift? Blech!” I know they've got templates that they 
have to fill out, but a lot of it is just driven by what's required, and there's not a lot of personal 
information. Then I kinda look at it and go, "Oh, yuck [laughs]. I'm glad I don't have to do that

anymore.” Like, the every eight hours skin assessments or stuff. I'm glad that I work in a clinic and don't 
have to do that. 
  
LK: Do you use your cell phone for patient treatment or coordination at all? 
  
BF: Never. 
  
LK: Alright. That's excellent. This has been really informative. I just have a couple more wrap up 
questions to ask. Do you have someone who you think of as a professional mentor, or who has 
influenced your career? 
  
[2:15:33] BF: Not one person. Not really, not that I can think of. Initially, like I mentioned, the books 
that Kubler Ross wrote on death and dying, but that's not a personal connection. I certainly learned a lot 
from colleagues and the styles that they have, listening to other people interact with patients. Joe, the 
doctor that I worked with in the HIV clinic, it was nice to see how he interacted with patients and 
encouraged other staff, and just the fact that he let me spend as much time with patients as he did was 
phenomenal. [Unintelligible]-- When they were remodeling our area, I had to work in the same office as 
a couple of other nurses. This was kind of when primary care was transitioning to what's called Patient-
Aligned Care Teams. Several of the nurses in that office would come up to me afterwards and go, "I am 
so jealous that you know your patients," 'cause they had my direct number and they knew that if they 
called and I didn't answer, they could leave a message and I would call back within an hour usually. I do 
really have the benefit of having enough time to take care of patients the way they want to be taken care 
of. It's kind of funny, 'cause if I have to interact with home care agency or the home IV agencies, and if I 
get a voicemail from vendors who don't typically call me, when I call back, they are always shocked. It's 
like, "What? I wasn't expecting a call back today, or even this week really." I'm like, oh, that just that 
makes me sad, 'cause I know that that's their experience, that they don't hear back from people for a very 
long time. That makes me feel kind of good about how I do the way I do my job. 
  
LK: That's wonderful. 
  
BF: Probably didn't answer your question [laughs]. 
  
LK: No, it's perfectly fine. That was a lot of really good information. The next question is, How has the 
VA changed in the course of your career? 
  
[2:19:01] BF: [Laughs] It's changed a ton, partly driven by, of course, technology and advances in 
medicine. Like I said, the VA definitely supports research, so clearly I appreciate the VA and what it 
does. I'm not blind to the fact that public perception is that it's a public hospital and people are not gonna 
get good care, but we just hear from our patients over and over how overwhelmingly pleased they are 
with the care that they get and how surprised at the quality. Time and time again, they're like, "If I 
wasn't coming here, I would be dead." They really appreciate it. I used to be glad that I didn't have to go 
to the VA for care, because things did seem to be really slow. My initial experience, of course, was from 
the inpatient side. We'd be discharging patients and I would look at their appointment list and I'd go, 
"Oh, they have an audiology appointment, they have an eye appointment, they have a dental 
appointment," and they would all be on different days. It's like, well, audiology is only here on 
Tuesdays, the eye clinic is only here on Wednesdays and Thursdays and dental only sees patients in the

afternoons. Patients would have appointments a day apart. I'm like, "Really? Is that the best we can do?" 
Or an x-ray to see if their knees were bad would be a week or two out. That has changed, where we try 
to bundle and get all of these follow-up appointments on the same day, or we'll try to streamline it, 
because we do have patients who come from a really long ways away. That's one of the nicest changes, 
where we can get their follow-up appointments on the same day. I know that seems like a silly little 
thing, but it's helped a lot for patient satisfaction [chuckles]. 
  
LK: That sounds like it would be really helpful. It does not sound like a small thing at all. Yeah, that's 
absolutely wonderful. 
  
BF: Truly, now I just kinda go, I wish I could come to the VA for my care. I see it as a really good 
system. Could it be spread nationwide for everybody in the country? Maybe not, because, as we know, 
every VA is a little bit different. You're only gonna get the quality of care as the pool of personnel. As a 
nurse, I can never make more than my peers in the community. When they do a survey for salaries, I can 
make the same, and they can only do a survey when there's a cost of living adjustment, so that's kinda 
based on whatever the president decides. If the cost of living can go up, then they can do a survey. If the 
cost of living adjustment doesn't get changed for two or three years, we don't get any changes to our 
rates. We don't really get bonuses, but, like I said, we get five weeks of vacation, and there are other 
benefits. We can pay into our retirement fund, and I don't know that that happens in the private sector, at 
least in nursing. It's kind of a hard sell to say that our compensation is great, and so attracting quality 
employees can be a little bit more challenging. 
  
LK: Well, still, it sounds like it's different but still pretty good. I mean, five weeks vacation. 
  
BF: I know, right? 
  
LK: Yeah, I mean-- 
  
BF: It never goes up. I had started with five weeks a year; I still get five weeks a year. But you have to 
sign up for your leaves. I'm at a point where between my sick leave and my vacation, I could literally be 
off for 10 months and get paid. 
  
LK: Yeah, that's incredible. 
  
BF: Yeah, I don't think that happens in the private sector. But, then somebody else will say, "Well, but I 
make $5 an hour more than you." "But can you work full-time?" because a lot of places don't hire full-
time and the VA really does. Most of our staff I think is full-time. So, there's trade-offs. 
  
LK: That sounds incredible. Sounds like a very good job. One last question is, How have you seen your 
job change over the course of your career? 
  
[2:25:09] BF: My job has probably changed as much as I have. You look at your parents and just kind of 
go, "Oh, they were young and they were stupid and now they're old and a little less stupid" [laughs] 
That's kind of how I was. I was nervous. I was young and stupid. I was idealistic; I thought I could 
change the world. I'm like, "You know what? If I can change one person's attitude about this, that was a 
good day.” I appreciate the changes that technology has made. Even silly little things like soap. Soap is

better than it used to be. If you look at laundry soap, it's improved. The medical community benefits 
from all of those changes as well. Food safety, it all just kind of rolls in together. Medications purity, 
seeing things shipped not just in the country but shipped around the world. Having access to technology 
and things that they're learning in Europe, things that they're learning even in Africa, things that they're 
learning in China. We all benefit if they can share information. Do egos get in the way? Certainly. We 
need to look back at just HIV testing and researchers identifying that first. There's still an argument: 
Was it first in France? Was it first in Atlanta? It's like, who cares? They found it. Those kind of 
arguments can delay things, can delay quality, can delay improvements. If you get a chance to read that 
Best Care Anywhere book, the leadership of the VA, when the doctors that were kind of cutting edge on 
using computers for tracking lab results, their leaders would literally come into their work rooms and 
smash their computers. It's like, “We are not using that!" It's not always change that is readily adopted, 
but eventually it makes its way into the mainstream. 
  
LK: Absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much for agreeing. 
  
BF: When she was in nursing, taking a blood pressure was still a medical function; the doctors had to do 
it. Just the things that we have technicians doing these days. It amazes me. 
  
LK: That is incredible. Thank you so much for agreeing to speak with us.
