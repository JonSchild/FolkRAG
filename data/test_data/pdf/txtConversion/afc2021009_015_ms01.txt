CH 00:04
Good morning and thank you for agreeing to participate in this historical project, the Archie Green
Folklife Occupation Initiative with the Library of Congress. How are you this morning?
RF
I'm doing well. I appreciate you for asking and, you know, allowing me to, I guess, give my side.
CH
Thank you so much. Would you please give us your complete name and the year only of your birth?
RF
Sure. Complete name is Richard O. Fajimolu, born in '78.
CH
That's 1978?
RF
1978.
CH
Where were you born and raised?
RF
I was born in Nigeria. I came when I was eight years old and been here ever since.
CH
Prior to you coming to the United States, what city, what village?
RF
Oh, village. Well, I was born in-- it's called Ibadan, but mainly raised up in, like, Lagos, you know, and
then after that, my family transitioned here and I came a bit much later with my father in 1986.
CH
What tribe are you from?
RF
I'm part of the Yoruba tribe.
CH
Can you tell us a little bit about the Yoruba tribe?
RF
Sure, sure. It's one of the largest in Nigeria, which is part of the west coast of Africa and, as many
knows, there's a lot of Nigerians that pretty much migrate, you know, to the United States, to the UK.
Once again, it's the largest out of the four that you will primarily know that's Nigeria, even though there
are different dialects, but the Yoruba tribe is the main common one that's known. Then, you have the
3
afc2021009_015
Igbo and you have the Fulanis and then you have Hausas, so those are the four majors. Granted, there's
different dialects amongst all of us.
CH
Are the Yoruba-- Am I saying that right?
RF
Yup.
CH
Are the Yoruba known for any particular profession or family traits, anything like that?
RF
Besides working hard and, you know, having a main focus on our education, I would just say all around,
I think Nigerians as a whole are very-- we're all kind of driven in the same common goal. It’s looking at
education as the primary. As in what their customary [inaudible 2:32], probably more of, like, always
sticking with our tradition, you know, making sure that we're all, you know, well-groomed and
well-versed in our tradition and sticking with it. As you know, even an older generation that’s here in
America is still the same thing. It’s always sticking with tradition. So, we're pretty good of a stickler on,
you know, sticking with the tradition and our culture. So, even though you’re Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, they
still want you to be, you know, in that culture, you know, at all times, which is, I guess, maybe one of
the big things that allows us to still stick together as family, you know, in the Nigerian culture.
CH
You tell me a little more about your tradition.
RF
Sure, sure. So, with the Yoruba, it's always, of course-- Actually, even to use a current situation, having
my father passed just about a couple of weeks ago, me being the oldest son, I'm now the head of
household, so I am to, you know, make sure all of my siblings, you know, to always keep them in, you
know, within the family tradition and making sure things are being done accordingly. I'm kind of now
their father even though they're of age, but I'm still their father. I'm still the one that they're to come to,
you know, to make sure things are done just as well. As the oldest, you're now responsible for any
family ties that need to happen, whether it's finance, whether it is, you know, anything that's pertaining
to moving forward, which I have a brother that's much younger than I am. He's 16, so he's also my
responsibility to make sure I see him through his, you know, his school years along with his college,
making sure everything that's necessary for him is done accordingly, whatever is needed financially for
him, emotionally, physically, you know, I'm now in that role to, you know, to aid him in it. So, there's no
escaping that part. Even though I have a older sister, I'm still responsible, you know, more so. One thing
that I could tell you, within the past two weeks, I don't think I heard that enough: “You're now the daddy
of the house. You're now the daddy of the house.” So, you know, that’s one thing that, you know,
culturally that they instill in all of us. They want us to continue that tradition and no matter what
happens, and this is how it goes.
CH
Let's talk about your family dynamic: your parents, your siblings.

RF 05:18
So, my father and my mother, they met in Nigeria. My father, you know, as he passed, he initially started
in-- 1979 was the year that he actually came to the United States. He came on a scholarship to the
United States. He actually went to school at District of Columbia initially. From District of Columbia, he
transitioned here and went to Morgan State University, where he received his master's. Then, later on, he
received his Doctorate in Theology. So, that was a, you know, huge plus, but he and my mother, they
had separated long before I even migrated here, and my mom just kind of, you know, had, I think, like,
early stages of, like, maybe college and then, you know, never really [inaudible 6:13] or anything. Now
with her, she started her own business, you know, back home, where, you know, she was just kind of,
you know, selling, like, the basic necessities that people would generally need. I do remember that as a
kid as well, she had a, you know, a store of her own, kinda a person that had, like, a mini supermarket,
you know, if you will. Everything that you possibly need, she was the person that you will go to, and as
the years continued, she maintained that. I currently actually have her with me and she's been with me
for the past three years so she can kind of see her grandkids, you know, kind of grow up, which has
been, you know, a good thing. I currently-- Can't even say currently [chuckles], but I do have six other
siblings. I am the oldest and then I have a younger brother and in the midst of that I have five sisters.
Not all of us are by the same mother, but by blood we are brothers and sisters. So, no matter what, you
know, I keep us close. I have my older sister who currently still lives in Nigeria. She herself as well, she
did graduate and has her master's. I can't remember exactly what it is, but she has a master's from what
we, you know, graduate from back home. She's also one that kinda followed the trend of my mom. She
has her own business and kinda supplies the needs for, like, people that need that. Then, I have my sister
that was born after me. She has her Master's in Early Education and currently works as a teacher in
Howard County school system. Then, my sister that's right after her, she's a family doctor who currently
works at, like, Northwest, practices at Northwest. The one after that, she has her master's, who went to
UNBC and got her master’s from UNBC and currently is the marketing manager at Security Plus, one of
the, like, what do you call it, credit union banks is where she's at. Then, a younger one, she currently
lives in Texas. She did start college. I'm not exactly sure what part she finished it. Then, of course, the
youngest one, which is, you know, my brother, Isaac, and he's currently still in high school, ready to start
his senior year in August. So, you know, and that's just where we are at. We're still very, very close and
we talk. We see each other quite often. Actually, my sister who's the school teacher, she actually schools
two of my kids, you know, and kinda does lessons with them four days a week, you know, so we keep
that going. Let me see. I'm married and my wife as well [inaudible 9:07] me. She encouraged me to do
the nursing program because she's a nurse as well herself. We actually went to the same university. She
graduated from there first [laughs] and myself and actually my sister that has her master's as well also
graduated from there with her bachelor's and her master's at Coppin State University. So, we're alumnis,
all of us, so I'm in shock I don't have my, you know, my stuff here showing up, you know, at the
university, but that's my family dynamic.
CH
How many children do you have?
RF
I currently have three, and I think that will be it actually [laughs]. That will be it. I have Ashley who's
four, Allison who's three, and my newborn who's three months old. That's RJ, we call him. He's a junior.
5
afc2021009_015
CH
Okay, two girls and one boy.
RF
Two girls and one boy.
CH
Got that boy.
RF
You know, I say, “K.C. – Kitchen Closed” [both laugh]. He completed, you know, my trinity, so he's the
last of ‘em.
CH
Wonderful. Where do you currently reside – your city and state?
RF
I'm currently in Baltimore, Maryland, or you could call it-- Everybody know Baltimore, Maryland but
I'm in the Windsor Mill area. This is where I've been for the past almost 20 years now. Since I've been
back from New Jersey, I’ve pretty much resided here in Baltimore.
CH
Your education in Nigeria as a little boy, what was that like?
RF 10:40
Oh, it was a mixture, as far as what I remember. What I will also tell you is, it wasn't fast-paced but it
was demanding on how we were to be in school. I think at the time, even though I was only eight years
old by that time, I was already going into the fifth grade there by our standard and our culture-wise, but
when I came here, I had to go to the third grade. They did teach us, you know, how to speak English, but
I was one of those-- I was reluctant to learn how to speak English so, hence, the reason why I took the
step back when I came here, you know. It was for me to brush up on, you know, the English language
and be able to, you know, compete with the other students and have that. It was a tough transition for me
at that time because I was pretty much reluctant to be here. But, you know, as a child, what more can
you say? [laughs] So, I guess that transition caused me to fight a lot, you know, when I first got here,
because I didn't know what people were saying. So, I was used to the laughing, the pointing, you know,
when people were doing such and hearing the names that they were calling me, so I would fight to
defend myself, you know. At least that was the thing. So, it got to a point, I think they told my dad at the
time, they said, “Well, look. We need you to, you know, keep him home because all he wants to do is
fight. He's disrupting, you know, the class and, you know, the students are afraid of him,” and so my
father kind of homed me for, I think, my first year. I mean, that was probably one of my toughest years
too ‘cause he [laughs]-- His thing was, “I no longer want you to speak our native language in the house.
You must talk to me in English. You have to speak to me in English. That's all I want you--" So, to look
at it now in this day and age-- I'll tell you why it’s a funny story. My cousin said to me the other day--
Him and his family, they came to my house on Saturday. He said to me, he said, “Uncle, I was speaking
to you in our language but I realized you will only talk back to me in English,” and I said, “You don't
want to know the story.” I said, [laughs] “My father insisted that I did not speak our native tongue,
6
afc2021009_015
because in order for me to be able to be around other kids, I needed to learn how to speak English and
that was very important.” So, I think as a kid, I took that to heart and just never really spoke our native
language. Granted, I understand everything. If you’re speaking it, I hear you. It's allowed me to be a
chameleon in a sense, because people look at me and they hear my tone and they say, “Oh, you're
American. You're Americanized. You're no longer, you know, the native tongue, you know. In a sense,
you're not one of us.” So, I've experienced both sides of the spectrum where I've gone home, and home
they look at me as-- the word that's being used, “akata”.
CH
Akata.
RF
Akata, yeah, which meaning African-American type of tone. That's what you are now. You're no longer,
you know, the Yoruba person that we know, you know. You're an akata now. Then when I come here,
then it's the other way around. Oh, you're, you know, you're-- The words “African booty scratcher.” I
would never forget that. I would never forget that. I mean, those were the words and the torment and,
“Oh, you have flies flying around your head,” you know. I mean, it was tormenting. It was tormenting, I
mean, even up to the point that I would even say ‘til now that I still have people still, you know, make,
you know, references to the last name, where, “Oh, what is that?” you know. “How do you say it?” you
know. It got to the point where after a while, I had to stop being mad, being angry and just start
understanding that you need to meet people where they are. I started understanding that, you know. My
last name is Fajimolu, you know, and I had to start going in a point of telling people how to say my last
name, you know. I say, “Well, if you break it down, it's four syllables, you know: faj-e-mo-lu,” you
know, and it was like, “Oh!” So, “Yeah,” I said, “it’s really that easy.” I said, “It's not as complicated as
you think it is,” you know. I said, “If people can say, you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s last name,
which is almost the whole letter of the alphabet,” I said, “you can simply say eight letters,” you know. I
had that challenge and it took some growing for me, I mean, for me to grow, to understand, you know,
people’s level of intelligence, people's level of ignorance, you know. It was a lot, you know. I look back
at those days now and I said, “Man.” I said, “That was a place, you know. That was a struggle, you
know. Even being held back two years, you know, in order for me to catch up, that was, you know, that
was a challenge within itself.” Even, you know, through family, you know, dynamics and, you know,
having, you know, different siblings, you know, having my siblings by different moms, you know, just
looking at that, it was a challenge, you know, but we maintain it, you know. You learn and you grow,
you know. As you grow, you start understanding people, you start understanding yourself, you know.
But, I think ultimately, once you understand yourself a little bit better and know how to react to things
and everything is not a fight, or everything is not something that you have to win, kinda get a better
understanding. It took me years to understand that, you know, but you have to deal with your own
aggression before you can move on, and that's what it was.
CH
Your transition, then, from Nigeria to the United States was pretty traumatic as a child.
RF 17:03
Yeah, I would say the least it was. I honestly would. I think more so looking at it, it wasn't a choice that I
had my hand in, you know. You had to respect your parents and you had to honor your parents and, you
know, for my father, he felt that was what was best. I appreciate him today for it, you know, because it
7
afc2021009_015
did make me a better person. Initially, I didn't think so. Initially, even as I was still going through high
school and he and I would fight quite a bit because he was trying to teach me certain ways and I was
being brought up in the American culture so, you know, I acted as the American culture versus, you
know, the Nigerian culture. It was a challenge, you know, and he and I, we bumped heads, you know. I
felt that I knew better [chuckles]. He felt that he knew better [chuckles], you know. As his son, you
know, I decided to, you know, leave home at a early age. I think I was, like, literally just graduated high
school at the time and I left [chuckles]. I said, “Well, I'm outta here,” you know. That transition too was,
you know, was quite a, you know, a challenge within itself because I thought I had guidance of my own
knowledge but I didn’t. I didn’t, you know. I learned, and from there, I started making decisions that
didn't see me going anywhere. I called my mom, you know, here, which was my, you know, my
stepmom and I told her, I said, “Look, I need to get away from New Jersey. I'm not making all the right
decisions in my life,” so, you know. Her first thing was, “Well, you can come back, and if you do, you
have to go to school. There's no issues but you just can’t sit in here and, you know, thinking that’s it.” I
said, “Okay.” So, that was our deal, you know, and I went back to a trade school at the time, and from
the trade school, I really didn't do anything because I really didn't, you know-- Even though I got the
certification-- It was like a 18-month course. I got the certification. After trying several positions, I
noticed nobody, you know, was hiring. I was like, “Okay, well, I'm done with that,” and she encouraged
me, “Well, why don't you try the university?” I said, “I tried that before, and that was what me and my
father was fighting about, you know. I really don't want to get me now” [laughs].
CH
What was your certification in?
RF
This was like, 2002-ish timeframe. It was Test Technology at the time, and they taught us how to-- It
was ECT, if I remember. It was, like, Electrical Something Something. I can't remember exactly, but
they showed us how to break down the computers back then and work on putting them back together. I
will never forget this: I had an interview with Northrop Grumman, which was one, Lucent Tech, and I
can’t remember, some other location in Hunt Valley. There was a process that you go through, phases
that you go through, and I think I might have made it to, like, phase 2 through Northrop Grumman, you
know, showing them that I was capable of working on a computer, being able to solder to a point where
you can't even tell that you soldered something, because the processors back then, they were this big
and, you know, you had to be able to put all the, you know, the components, you know, the homes
soldered completely, so nothing is touching or messing with the motherboard, compared to the
microprocessors that you see that are this big now, you know, and they have everything installed, so
that's what they showed us. Of course, when you go to a trade school like that, what they say is, “Oh, we
promise to get you a job, find you a job,” and, you know, that's what was in my mind, but what they
actually do is they just let you know where openings are. So, I will go to wherever there was a opening,
you know. Of course, there's a bunch of other people there that’s also trying to get the same position and,
you know, I guess the best person, you know, gets the position at the time, you know. So, I went back to
school. This was in, like, 2004. I started doing business administration. I said, “Well, I like business,”
you know, “and let me see what I could do in this.” Started that and stopped. Years go by and, you know,
my mom said, “Well, what about you workin’ in bankin’?” 2005, I started working in M&T Bank. From
M&T Bank, I continued the transition. I said, “Well, you know what? Since I'm here at M&T Bank, let
me pick back my business administration,” and I started doing that accounting stuff. I got into banking
very heavy, because by the time I left there, I actually became Assistant Branch Manager right before I
8
afc2021009_015
left. I started as a teller and worked my way up to personal banker 1 then personal banker 2. I would
never forget, you know, this gentleman. His name was [inaudible 22:23]. He was a pretty big help. He
was a new manager that came to the branch where I was and he said to me, he said, “Look.” He said, “I
see how well you work with the customers, you know, but would you like to try something else?” I said,
“Sure, you know. I'm open-minded,” and he said, “Well, I'm gonna put you in some places. Just don't
question what. Just pay attention, you know. Keep your head down and follow my lead.” I said, “Not a
problem.” He will always ask me to do certain things and I will do it, and that, you know, kind of
catapult me into getting into what they called back then, it was, like, management in training. Out of 36
of us that was selected, I was the only Black guy. There was a total of maybe six of us that might have
been, you know, African-American. They sent us everywhere: Pennsylvania, Buffalo, you know, all
different trainings. Then, at the end of it, you were to be assigned to a branch. So, I did it until, like,
2010. I think the politics of banking, you know, was enough for me. In the process, I was going to
school, changed my major from Business Administration then I went to respiratory therapy. From
respiratory therapist, I was like, “Ah, this is not it.” I said, “I'm having a hard time.” I passed all my
main courses to get me into the program. I didn't get in. I made a big fuss with the dean of the, you
know, health department at that community college at the time. He said, “Well, look. We have a new
program that's coming up. It’s the anesthesia technology program. This is new. It's off the ground. We
are joint partner with John Hopkins University, I mean, at Johns Hopkins Hospital and this is where they
will have all the clinicals.” I said, “Okay, fine.” I said, “Well, put me in,” I said, “because I don't want to
sit idle for another year,” I said, “because if I do, nothing is gonna happen.” So, I did it and within, you
know, two years or 18 months it might have been, I completed the program. I got my associate's degree
out of that and-- But from that, that's what led me into the nursing.
CH
So, let me back up a minute. So, the associate degree is in what?
RF
It’s in anesthesia technologist.
CH
What does an anesthesia technologist do?
RF
So basically, you’re assistant anesthesiologist, you know, in the operating room, but I just-- For me, it’s
seeing what was going on in the operating room. I said, “I want to do that. I want to do what they're
doing, be in the operating room and be the one. If I'm not the anesthesiologist myself or the anesthetist
myself, I don't want to be the assistant. I want to be the main person, because I was so fascinated with
the surgeries that I was seeing-- That's one thing I will applaud Johns Hopkins for. As we were doing our
clinical rotation, you could go into any of the operating room in whatever department you were in. I
mean, I was going in and out every room possible. I was so fascinated with it. Prior to, my wife was
telling me years ago, “Why don't you try nursing? You have this attention to detail and you see things,”
and I told her, I said, “Nursing is not for me. I have no interest in this.” I'm saying, “I'm not doing it.”
Mind you, everybody with the exception of myself, my sister Christina, my sister Gloria, everybody's in
medical. I'll tell you that in a minute. I was like, “No, that's not what I want to do,” and my wife was
like, you know, “Try it, [inaudible 26:19]”. When I got into this program and did the anesthesia
technology program and I saw the operation, I was so fascinated. She said, “You weren't, you know, like,
9
afc2021009_015
disgusted by the, you know, the blood?” I said, “No.” I said, “It fascinated me.” I said, “I've been sitting
around here wondering what do I want to do.” So, I completed that. I immediately, as soon as I
graduated, I went to Coppin State University and I asked, “What do I need to enroll here so I can join
your nursing program?” That's what I did.
CH
What year was that?
RF
This was 2018 I think. Yeah, 2018. It was 2018, because my second daughter was born the same day I
had to take the entry exam and I was at the hospital that night and I went from the hospital straight to the
testing site. When I tell you, I was sleeping in front of the computer and, of course, it was the last day
that you could possibly take it because I didn't have enough time frame to schedule for, you know,
another time, so I literally had to wait ‘til a whole year. So, I didn't get into the program ‘til 2019
because I had to wait and I had to take the, you know, retake the entry test because I didn't do so well on
the, you know, the initial part, but I was so elated when I got the email that came through saying, “You
have been selected. You are now part of the Helene Fuld, you know, School of Nursing.” I was so happy
and it was something that I wanted to do because I wanted to become an anesthetist and I knew the only
shot that I would have is you have to have two years of ICU underneath your belt before, you know, you
can apply to get into the program. I said, “Well, there's no way to get into the program. I don't have any
nursing experience.” So, I said, “Okay, this is my way.” So, I went through and I actually just graduated
May 20th of this year.
CH
Congratulations.
RF
Thank you. So, you know, I actually just got my ATT alert, so I'll be taking my state board probably
within the next month. I went through and I stuck with it. So, within the past, I would say, five years,
I've been consistently been in school, from graduating with A.D. and just continue with, you know, with
the nursing program.
CH
So, you went from the Associate Program--
RF
Yes.
CH
In Anesthesia--
RF
Technology.
CH
Technology. Did you work in that for a while?
10
afc2021009_015
RF
No, not at all.
CH
You just kept going to school. So, from there, you went to Coppin State.
RF
Coppin State University.
CH
What is the name of the nursing school again?
RF
Helene Fuld.
CH
Helene Fuld.
RF
Yeah, Helene Fuld.
CH
Okay, so that's Coppin State University here in Baltimore and you just graduated from that.
RF
Yes.
CH
You're getting ready to take the licensure exam.
RF
Exactly.
CH
What is your preparation for that?
RF
Preparation has been tough, I will tell you, because I've gone through a couple of family changes, but I
have what they call UWorld. So, UWorld is something that the school has allotted to us. They've given
us access to it until November or December of this year, so they give us a six-month timeframe. So, I've
actually been preparing on that. I also just currently signed up with this young lady that assists
individuals on preparing for, you know, for the NCLEX as well. So, it's a five-week program with her, so
after that, I’ll be prepared, you know, be ready to, you know, take the exam.
CH
When do you expect to take the exam?
11
afc2021009_015
RF
I'm shooting for August, early August.
CH
August is coming up.
RF
Early August. So, my goal is, you know, go through the five weeks. As soon as the five weeks is up,
probably, you know, take a week to, you know, do more studying and then, you know, just go right into
it. So, that's my goal.
CH
Lots of dedication.
RF
Yes, yes.
CH
Have you applied to any graduate nurse-- You call ‘em “graduate nurse” now. Is that right?
RF 30:26
I actually have a position already. I’m actually scheduled to start on the 27th of June. This interview, I
actually had the interview before I even finished my last semester. I had it back in January. I went in
and, you know, I visited the unit, I spoke with the manager. ‘Cause at the time, there was a program that
we filled out for a scholarship and it was called Clinical Scholar. I don't even know how many people
applied to it, but I literally applied for that scholarship the last day that you could possibly apply for it
and didn't hear anything for about a month. We were on our winter break when I got the call. The lady
said, “Well, look. You have been selected to be one of the Clinical Scholars.” So, the Clinical Scholar,
basically what it entails is you have a option of picking where you would like to be or to do your clinical
practicum. So, I had chose trauma, med surg, and I forgot the third one, but I know trauma and med surg
were my two that I initially selected and I got picked for the trauma unit. So, I will be at what they call
the University of Maryland Downtown and it's called an Intermediate Care Unit, which they also
showed for IMC, and I will be on T5, which is the fifth floor. So, I interview with the floor manager
there and I kid you not, it was on a Monday that I did the interview, roughly, I would say, maybe two
o'clock in the afternoon. I also did a bit of a shadow until, like, maybe for a few hours there, saw how
the unit was. The next day, I got a call from the recruiter saying, you know, “They would like to, you
know, bring you on board.” I’m like, “I didn't even graduate yet [laughs]. How is this happening?” So,
just looking at, I said, you know, “This is my last semester. I haven't even started the last semester yet
and I'm already, you know, lucky to get a position. So, I did everything that was necessary. I spoke to the
recruiter, kind of went through and then they gave me the scholarship as well, and with the scholarship
came along with me doing my clinical practicum on that same unit. So, for 12 weeks I was on that unit
and so I got the chance to, you know, of course, shadow my preceptor as well as, you know, assist in
whichever way they possibly let me. I'm pretty excited about it because, for myself, it was something
that I wanted to do, more so to get the experience, you know, see how it is, see what, you know, what's
demanded of me, to help me also sharpen my skills. So, I chose something that I knew will be
demanding in a sense, so that way, you know, at least I'll be able to see all different types of patients and
12
afc2021009_015
also know how to maneuver within those patients and whatever is necessary. So, it was a choice that I
made and I was shocked that it's fallen in line. So, here I am.
CH
The scholarship went towards your tuition?
RF
My education, my last semester. Yes ma’am.
CH
Did you get a salary while you were doing your practicum?
RF
No, not at all.
CH
But you had that special opportunity to go into that specialized unit?
RF
Yes, I did.
CH
You said for 12 weeks.
RF
For 12 weeks, yeah.
CH
Being a male nursing student, what was that experience like?
RF 34:15
Okay, so there are the pluses and minuses of it.
CH
Ok, let’s get it all.
RF
So, the plus that I'm hearing is, you know, it's a high demand for male nurses to come and, you know, to
be on a unit and, you know, that made me feel excited at the point that, you know, I felt that there was a
need for me and that I would get the opportunity to not only sharpen my skills but also be able to help,
you know, others, and knowing the type of person that I am, one: I'm very caring, two: I love to help
people, you know, so when I saw the fact that, okay, you know what, as a male, you know, they're asking
for you to actually come, I was pretty excited about it, you know. The unit that I will be on, the only
thing that I think I felt out of place about was that I will be the only African-American male nurse on my
unit, you know. I think for me, I like to be in a more diverse setting, you know, and just to feel, I guess,
more included, you know. When I say that, it's to feel, in a sense, that, you know, if I do bring something
13
afc2021009_015
up or about how our unit could grow up, probably be better, that it’s not looked at as if I'm trying to, you
know, change the culture of the unit or I'm just trying to, you know, do things that's only going to
benefit, you know, myself or people of myself and so, you know, that's not, you know, what I would
want. But, I'm still kind of looking at it, even though it's the unit that I chose, I will honestly say that I
want it to be more diverse, you know, for me, you know, and it definitely will go a long way in
morale-wise, you know. To me, my observation is seeing for everybody, you know, that's on the unit. So
that's just how I feel, and it's just kind of, like, even when I did the anesthesia tech, part of that was
wanting to be changing, I guess, I don't want to say it was a stigma, but what I observed was that I
realized that a lot of the technologists were African-American, you know, whereas the anesthesiologists
or the CRNA were more of different ethnic groups, you know, and I felt that, to me, it just wasn't diverse
enough, you know. We want to be in this medical field, you know, but also feel included, to be
engrossed, you know, in every sector possible, not the point at just being, you know, the tech or being
the-- What is it that I also observed? It seems like every, you know, it's just more so, like, the techs and
that that's their position, and I know we're capable and better than just being, you know, just the techs of
the position. Granted, you know, some people, their mindset might be, “Oh, I’m comfortable in the
position that I'm in,” you know, but I know myself, I'm driven internally by myself, so with that, I know
I want to go to the next step and push and try to pull as many others that I can with me, just to, you
know, give them the same opportunity that I have.
CH
The downside of being a male nursing student.
RF
Yeah.
CH
What was that?
RF
Looking in a class of 55 and only knowing that it's only six of us. I don't know if it's because it's just the
fact that they feel the more caring or the nurturing part is more of a female thing.
CH
That's kind of sexist.
RF
You know, it does--
CH
You're a father.
RF
I'm a father, you know, so I could care for people. Just looking at it as and hearing that, “Oh, you're
gonna have it easy. You're gonna have it easy ‘cause you're a man.” No, I want to work for what I'm
getting, you know, because I'm just like you. I'm a human being, you know. We're in the same
profession, you know. I am determined to work for what I get, you know, as I've always worked for what
14
afc2021009_015
I get, you know. You do hear that, you know, and it's, like, I don't want for us as the male in this field,
one: to look at it as an advantage for us to take, you know, and on the flip side is, you know, I don't want
you to look at me as that's the only reason why I'm here is to take advantage, you know, which, you
know, you hear that. Like I said, I hear that a lot. “Oh, you're gonna have it easy. Oh, the professors like
you because you're a guy,” or, “They listen to you because you're a guy.” Like, you have the same voice
as I do. Speak up, you know, but just be mindful of how you speak up, you know. The way I might deal
with somebody might not be the same way you deal with them. I could learn from you just as well as
you could learn from me and see how we handle things. Even on the unit that I'm gonna be going to, one
of my classmate already works on that unit. Her and I, you know, we're conversing with each other and
she was giving me all the ideas that she has. I said to her, I said, “Well, look. You've been there longer
than I have. One thing I will ask you is, don't leave.” I told her, I said, “I don't want you to leave.” I said,
“Well, maybe you and I could be the change that that unit needs.” I said, “You have the experience
already of knowing that unit,” you know. She's a tech there, but now she's gonna be an RN there on the
same unit, so-- and I know how that transition can be. It can be difficult for her as well, so she's gonna
need, you know, that support, whether it's from myself, just, you know, just reassuring her that she is to
be here, that she has the capability to be here, you know, and it's that within itself. She's mentioned on
how she's pitched ideas, you know, about what we could do on that unit. Me hearing that, I will rather
help somebody like that, you know, to say, you know, “Let's push it together,” you know. “Let's move it
forward and maybe, you know, we can change it. We can make it better. We can, you know, do
something different.” Her thing is being discouraged about it and saying that, “Well, you know, I've
tried,” and, you know, sometimes it takes multiple attempts, you know, and that's the part that I tried to
look at. Like, “Yeah, you're a tech now but it's okay. You're about to transition. Would you take your
board? Would you start it?” So, you know, yeah, it's gonna be another challenge that you're gonna have
to deal with, but I don't want you to lose your fire, that drive, you know, and that's the, you know,
dynamics for me where I come from, saying, “Listen, just because I'm a guy doesn't necessarily mean if
they will really listen to me as well, but we can try, you know, and just kind of do it in that sense.” So,
looking at it and even her saying it to me, “Well, you're a guy. They're gonna [inaudible 41:55].” “I hear
you,” I said, “but that's not how I'm looking at it, you know, and that's not my approach to, you know, to
working there. I want us to be able to work together, you know,” I said, “because you'll be shocked.
You're gonna show me things that I don't know because you've been on this unit longer than I have and
vice versa. I'll show you, you know, what I've learned from, you know, from somebody else and, you
know, we’ll be able to help each other out.”
CH
Has she been hired for that unit as well?
RF
Yeah. She will be starting much later than I have, I think almost a month after I will, but she's still there
right now as a tech, you know.
CH
So, they have hired you all as graduate nurses?
RF
Yes, yes.
15
afc2021009_015
CH
So, you have a certain amount of time that you have to get the licensure?
RF 42:42
The license. So, they do give you a timeframe. For mine, it’s 90 days. But on the same note, I got them
in a way where I changed my title. So, instead of coming in as a CN 1, which is generally what you'll be
for your first year and then second year you'll be a CN 2, I got mine to change it to Nurse Graduate. So,
as a Nurse Graduate, I'll have less responsibility as a CN 1 but I will still be in that role where I have
two preceptors that I'm shadowing, but I kinda won't be left alone, in a sense, where I'm able to get into
the Pyxis maybe, or able to, you know, do a patient's, you know, ABG or something like. I will still have
to have the preceptor being the one doing it and I'm just, you know, observing.
CH
The Pyxis is the same thing as medication cart?
RF
Medication cart, yeah.
CH
What does CN stand for?
RF
Clinical Nurse.
CH
Clinical Nurse.
RF
Yeah, Clinical Nurse.
CH
So, a Clinical Nurse has more responsibilities than the Graduate Nurse.
RF
Yes, correct.
CH
You had enough foresight to say, “I want to come in as a Graduate Nurse.”
RF
Exactly.
CH
There's a difference in the pay?
16
afc2021009_015
RF
No, the pay is the same.
CH
Okay.
RF
I said, [chuckles] “Well, it says that the pay is the same. Why not take on the opportunity?” you know.
CH
A man of great wisdom.
RF
So, I said I'd rather do that in the meantime, you know, one, and it's just to build the confidence in
knowing that I'll be able to do it, you know, once I'm left in a position that I am now by myself, because
if I do the Nurse Graduate, I still get that orientation phase, but then I also still get the, you know, get the
switch to the CN 1 and still have another orientation phase kinda. So, I thought about it.
CH
You thought that out well.
RF
I said, “Why put myself in a position where I'm not yet fully comfortable?” you know. Get the
opportunity to, you know, have the preceptors show me things, less responsibility. Also, give me the
opportunity to study well, you know, because I will be working at the same time, you know, trying to
prepare for the NCLEX. I don't want to put too much, you know. I'm still doing the 12-hour shift, ‘cause
everyone I was doing the clinical rotation is a 12-hour shift.
CH
Wow.
RF
You know, so I know how, you know, how that goes and, you know, of course, you know, you have the
good days, you have the-- It’s a rotation as well, you know, so it's not like you're primarily working
mornings or you're working at night. It's a constant, you know, rotation. So, you'll have days and you'll
have nights. So, hopefully, you know, I'll be able to have enough time in between where I'm still even
doing my, you know, my studies.
CH
As a student, when you were into your clinical training phase, you all had rotation with that as well? You
did days and nights?
RF
Yes.
17
afc2021009_015
CH
It really has changed.
RF
At least I did. I can't speak for everybody else, but I did because that unit, when they make the schedule,
the schedule is always you have to do nights and you have to do days. So, with my preceptor, I had to
follow her schedule. So, when she worked morning, I was there in the morning. When she had to work
at night-- Yeah, which I did hear about that too. What I was told was that generally it's the morning, but
no, I was there at night. I did the overnight, you know, went in at seven in the evening--
CH
Yes, got out at 7 in the morning.
RF
Or 8 in the morning. I am telling you, you know, it was a little bit of a challenge, you know, but because
I'm a night owl, I didn't have a problem, but when it got to that five, six o'clock, I'm like, “Wait a minute.
These eyes are trying not to stay open.”
CH
I think that’s everybody. I think that’s circadian rhythm, starts to shut down, starts to say, “I’m really the
boss. Try as you may, I am the boss.” I just want to go back a little bit. It sounds like you said your wife
was the person that inspired you to become a nurse?
RF
Yes.
CH
Is that correct?
RF
That’s correct. She was my initial phase of saying, “Listen, you can do this.” Because when her and I
met, she was in the nursing program and she graduated in 2012. I remember the nights, the days and the
study sessions that she had and I felt so bad. At that time, it was a good thing that I was in a position
where I told her, I said, “Well, look. You don't have to work. I'll help you, you know, as you're going
through this phase, you know, to get it through.” I think her last year, she didn't work. Well, kinda, like,
going into the last year, into the nursing program, she didn't work. She kind of, you know, stayed
focused on it. I mean, I watched and it was a lot, you know. It was a lot. She was always telling me that,
“You should try it,” you know. I said, “That's not, you know-- Nursing is for-- it's not for me. It's for,
you know, ladies.” My mom, you know, she graduated from Howard University with her BSN, so she
had already been doing it, you know, for years, and it was just something that I knew that she enjoyed.
One day, I saw the amount that she made. I said, “You make a lot of money.” I said it as a joke at the
time. I was like, “Man.” I said, “I didn't know,” you know, and I said, you know, “If that’s what it is--”
But, it was funny ‘cause it was a joke then, but I always knew the passion that I had and it was totally
different. So, when my wife constantly keeps saying it, I said, “No,” but when I got a chance to
experience that setting at Johns Hopkins, one of the person that also catapult my motivation more, her
18
afc2021009_015
name was Shannon Segres at the time. She's Shannon Yorkman now. She was so, I mean, when I tell
you, brilliant, and the way she moved and knew what she was doing. She was a CRNA.
CH
A CRNA is…?
RF
Is a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist.
CH
Okay.
RF
I watched her gracefully just work and as she sedated the patient and how she catered to them, and I was
like, “Okay.” I told her, I said, “I am admired by you. Like, you, what you did, like--” Ever since then, I
watched her. An African-American young lady as well. Later on, she got her DNP at Coppin State
University, which I think was recently as well. I told her, I said, “Listen, you motivated me as well. Not
only did you,” you know, but she was one of the professors with us at the time when we were going
through the anesthetist program, anesthesiologist program. She was, I mean, excellent at how she taught
us. I just, like, I said, “I really like how she works. I really, you know, I'm really admired by her.” When
that happened, I said, “Well, I'm going to the nursing program.” I said, “This is it. I wanna be just like
Shannon,” you know. I like how she moved. I like, you know, everything. I said, “My wife has always
said, ‘Oh, go to nursing program. Go through the nursing program.’” I said, “No,” but when I realized
that, yes, in order for me to, you know, move forward, I have to go through nursing in order for me to be
in ICU. So, hence my day today, you know, thanks to two wonderful ladies, you know, that one that
started the initial phase. The other one, you know, just kinda showed me how to, you know, how to
maneuver through it and I was just impressed by it and I said, “Okay.” So, here I am. 10 years after my
wife graduated and here I am, you know.
CH
You have the Bachelor’s of Science in Nursing.
RF
Yes.
CH
That's the degree that you were just conferred with.
RF
Yes, yes.
CH
You came into the nursing program just a little bit earlier than the declaration of COVID-19.
RF
Yes.
19
afc2021009_015
CH
How did that impact your nurse education?
RF 51:43
You know what? I would say we became the new norm. I look at it in this sense, right. I stated it to some
of my, you know, classmate and I mentioned it to my wife. If this class of ours of 55 and we're all
successful with our NCLEX, our alma mater will look into the online nursing program. I say it to say,
we started at the phase of COVID and we had to be homebound. We became the virtual class. That was
a challenge within itself because you were in your own home. It was online three-hour class session
every day. Attention span became--
CH
Was it 5 days a week?
RF
We were always three to four days, depending on, you know, the classes that we had to take. We always
had one day where it just was the longest day out of all the days, you know, and then we still had to do
our clinical rotations. We had challenges because some of the hospitals, you know, didn't have positions
for us to come and do the clinical rotations. Some people had to be, you know, had to take later date of
rotations because, you know, hospitals had to be cautious of how they were letting, you know, letting us
come to do clinical rotations. I mean, it was a lot. It was a lot, you know, and it was challenging, you
know, because you had to stay focused, you know, preparations for the exams, you know, and also
having to try to mediate within your other classmates, you know. “Hey, what schedule do you have
available?” you know, “so we could get together to study.” “Whose place are we meeting? Are we
meeting at Starbucks today? Are we meeting at Panera Bread today? Are we, you know, the library too,”
you know, and having to come in and wear the mask while you're in the library, you know. So, all the
new norms that we had to adapt to, you know, created a lot. I mean, anxiety levels for a lot of us was on
a new time high. For myself, personally, stress, depression, you know. At times I isolated myself
because it was just like, I'm like, “This is just way too much. This is way too much,” you know, and you
just had to deal with it the best way possible. So, yeah, it was a challenge. COVID did give us a, you
know, a run for our money, you know, to say the least. It really did. It was something totally different. It
also helped a lot of us, you know, come closer, you know. When you found, you know, your study group
and you felt comfortable within that study group, you were able to go to people's homes. I had people at
my house, you know. We were there late, you know, studying together, going through stuff, trying to
figure out what pattern work best for this person, what work best for all of us as a whole, you know,
even up to the point, like, until now that, you know, we kept the relationship going and everybody
checking on each other. “Are you okay?” you know, if you haven't heard from somebody in a couple of
days. “Hey, is everything alright?” you know. It was something that, I would tell you, if it wasn't for, you
know, the pandemic happening, I don't think, you know, a lot of us would be in that position right now,
you know. I don't know if you call it a gift and a curse because for some, they still have to work, you
know, and being able to not have to, you know, be in an actual class setting, we were virtual, that
allowed them to somewhat, you know, be at work, you know, to still be able to be, you know, in class,
you know. It was a challenge, you know, and had some of our classmate that had to work the night
before and be able to make sure that they woke up in the morning to, you know, to be able to stay awake
for class the next day. I mean, it was a challenge. It was a challenge.
20
afc2021009_015
CH
The clinical requirement was the same during COVID as prior to COVID?
RF
Oh, yeah.
CH
What was that requirement?
RF 56:16
Basically, we had to, dependent on the, you know, the courses that we were taking. So, let’s use a private
example. When I had community clinical and I also had psych clinical, so I had to make sure-- look at
the schedule that fit within what I could do and go to clinical. I was going to clinical twice a week
during that rotation, so I will go Thursday night and then I had clinical the next day, Friday morning.
CH
You were doing two clinicals?
RF
Two clinicals.
CH
They allowed you to do that.
RF
They allowed us to do because it was in two different locations, but we still had to get it done. We still
had to get hours in, you know, because you have to keep a track of, you know, how many hours. We
needed a total of 135 for each clinical. That was important, you know, to our graduation, because if you
didn't, you had to, you know, find some type of way to make it up through the summer, you know.
Hopefully there was something available, or if you happen to miss a day, you had to make it up, you
know, because it was part of our totals. Then, in my last semester, once again, I had two different
rotations. I had the rotation for my clinical practicum that I had to fulfill with, you know, for the hospital
and then I had a second clinical rotation that was on a Saturday, mind you, both a total of 12 hours. So, I
had to figure out between class, you know, look at the schedule, ‘cause class was Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday. Once again, Wednesday was our longest day. We had three classes on Wednesday, so you
can imagine, a hour break in between and you're sitting in front of the computer all day long, enough,
you know, trying to stay awake and, you know, and then on top of that, you had to, you know, make sure
you got your clinical rotations in. So, one was pretty stationary, where you knew it was every Saturday
or if you were in a Friday clinical, you knew it was every Friday. If you were in a Thursday clinical, you
knew it was-- Even some people had Sunday clinicals, and you just had to-- whatever fit within your
schedule, you had to try and get in there as best way possible, you know. Luckily, we were all able to,
you know, scramble, and a lot of frustration, a lot of, you know, calling the professors, you know,
“Listen, I can't get here. What can I do to get here?” I mean, it was just constant movement. We were
able to get through thanks to, you know, to a lot of our, you know, instructors as well, you know. They
helped us the best way they possibly can and we did as much as we could on our end. But, it was a lot. It
was definitely a lot.
21
afc2021009_015
CH
In your clinical experience, there was not a faculty from your university on site?
RF
No, there was, there was. So, each faculty had, or adjunct, had about six students that they would take
for their rotation.
CH
Okay. They did the 12 hours as well?
RF
The 12 hours as well. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah [chuckles]. That's why I say, yeah, and it was a lot.
You had some of the, you know, the faculties that had-- mine had two sets of students, you know. They
mighta did, like, a Friday and mighta did, like, a Saturday, or mighta did, like, a Thursday or did, like, a
Sunday, you know. It was a lot. It was a lot. I mean, it was a lot on us but it was a lot on them as well.
So, you know, we quite well understand, you know, how important it was and, you know, they took us
and showed us everything they possibly can, because we were solely their responsibility, not so much
the, you know, the hospital responsibility. So, they, you know, anything that we did or were trying to do,
of course, we had to include them and say, “Look,” you know, “What can we do?” We'll come in, map
out our schedule for that day. “Okay, you have room one and two. This is the nurse that’s assigned to
you. Make sure you run any and everything by them before you do anything,” as well as, “Okay, you
guys are only allowed to give [inaudible 1:00:38], or you could do 10 and 2,” or whatever the case was.
So, our assignments were laid out. We pretty much went through. You got your, you know, your shift
from the charge nurse. You knew which client, what room they were in. On top of that, you knew their
medication. For me, what I enjoy, when I was told my clinical practicum, I had the advantage of
working on Epic, so I was able to see all the information that was necessary for the patient. I knew the
time of their medication ‘cause it was already allotted out on the times. So, I just went through. I also
have my documentation. I wrote it down so that way, as I'm walking around, I flip it. “Okay, we're
getting close.” I knew what I needed to do, which kind of helped. This was something that they started
early on from us being in clinical, you know, with different clinical instructors. I even carry a fanny
pack. My fanny pack has my scissors, my pill crusher, has my pen light, has my stethoscope, has my
pen, you know. I have my extra batteries in it, you know, just to be prepared. That was something that I
learned from one of my clinical instructor. Our clinical instructor stated, “You do not want to go into
your patient's room and have to go back out. Whatever you need, check your, you know--” Everybody
looked at me, of course, once again, being a male [both laugh] and they're looking like, “You have a
fanny pack on.” I say, “Yeah, I got a fanny pack,” you know. I said, “But I don't have to leave the room
because I need my pill crusher because there's not one in here.” I could easily pull one out, you know,
and use it. I, you know, my stethoscope is here and, you know, my penlight is here. I don't want to have
to leave out the room if not. We talked about COVID. What about if you're going into a room where the
patient has COVID? You don't want to keep going back and forth. So, these teachers was so pivotal, you
know. I’d listen and I'm like, “Okay,” but not everybody carries it. I actually had one compliment from
one of the patient’s family member in the hospital. Come to find out she was a nurse. She said, “I like
your fanny pack.” I said, “Okay, thank you.” She said, “Don't worry. I have one too.” I was like, “Oh,
what do you do?” She said, “I'm a nurse.” “Oh,” I said. “Well, thank you.” So, I said, “Yeah.” I said, “I
always keep it with me.” You know, as I put it on, and until today I still have it. I'll put it on and I flip it
to the back. When I need it, I flip it to the front, go through, get what I need and, you know. It's good to,
22
afc2021009_015
you know, to hear the positive of it, but the pandemic did play a big part, you know, in us not being on
site, you know, at the school but, you know, we made it work. We made it work.
CH
You had time limits when you were working with the patients in your clinical because of COVID?
RF
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We did. We did. You know, of course, we will go in. We'll introduce ourselves as we
need to. Our schedule was always basically whatever the schedule that the nurse had, we did the same
thing. If a nurse goes in there, you go in, even at a point where you became the first person if you saw
the call bell, okay. “Let me go see what the patient need. What can I get for you?” “Oh, I, you know, I
just want my pillow adjusted.” “Okay. Not a problem”.  “I need a cup of water” or “I need to use the
commode,” you know, if they had a bedside commode. “Oh, not a problem,” you know. So, that allowed
me to be able to actually have the confidence to know I could go into the patient's room and not feel
timid in knowing that I could help them, because sometimes it was just the simplest thing that they
needed. I said, “Okay, well, you know, what can I do for you?” It became normal for me, you know. As
soon as I saw the call bell, I didn't even let the nurse get up. “I got it. It’s okay.” I'll go in and if it's
something that I needed assistance with then, you know, I would simply let them know, “Okay, I need
help with this,” and just did it. So, it was good.
CH
In your nurse education and also your clinical experience, did you face any racism or inequality?
RF 1:05:11
That's a good question. I say it's a good question because my first day I went into the unit that I'm
actually gonna be working on, I felt like I was being hazed. I was conversing with my preceptor via
email initially and I was told to meet her in the conference room for my first day. I said, “Okay, not a
problem. I'll, you know, I'll meet you in the conference room.” So, I was, like, one of the very first
persons to get into the conference room. When I got into that conference room, it's [inaudible 1:06:04]
desk, you know. The chairs are all around. First time, so I just picked a chair and I sat down because,
one: I didn't know what my preceptor looked like. I just knew the name, you know, so I said, “Okay,
fine.” I get in there and I sat down and gradually, other nurses started trickling in. They also started
sitting down. I didn't know that was the change of shift. I didn't know those were new nurses coming on,
you know, for the changeover. I didn't know. As I'm sitting there, as I witness people come in, I would
say, “Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.” Nobody’s speaking. I said, “No problem.” I left it
as is. So, the charge nurse for the night comes in to that room as well. I didn't know she was the charge
nurse for the night. When she came in, as I stated, I was saying, “Good morning.” Because the angle
where I was, I could see the door to the left, and when she came in, I said, “Good morning,” and she
gave me this stare as if she was trying to peel the skin off of me or something. I have no idea. I said,
“Good morning,” and she said, “You're sitting in my chair.” So, I looked side to side. I said, “This
chair?” She said, “Yes. That's my chair.” I said, “Oh, my apologies. I didn't know we had assigned
seats.” So, I got up with my backpack and I stood up the whole time. I kept my backpack on my
shoulder and I just stood there as, you know, the change of shift was happening. She was giving the
directions of what happened with the patients from the night before. I say that because all the other
nurses sat there and watched, and they knew the chair that I was sitting in that they generally reserved
that chair for the charge nurse from the night before as they deliver the information to the new nurses,
23
afc2021009_015
but not a single one of them said a word to me. Part of it was, like, you know, my apologies, was, “Well,
I'm waiting for Renee. Do you guys know who Renee is?” Come to find out, Renee had already came in
and also sat down. Now, this is a unit that everybody wears pink because it's shock trauma. University of
Maryland Shock Trauma, whole department, everybody wears pink.
CH
Like you have on today?
RF
Like I have on today. That day, and as I completed my whole clinical practicum, I'm the only person
that’s wearing all white. You can’t miss me. It's impossible. Not only you can’t miss me, I'm the only
Black guy. So, it's hard for me to sit there and say that it was okay, because there was six other nurses
that came in after me that could have simply told me or even said something to me as I was greeting
them as they came in, okay. “That chair is reserved for--” Okay. As we finished the round in there, I
stood the rest of the time because I didn't want to have to be that person that they're gonna label as being
angry or being sarcastic or, you know. I had to think fast on my feet is basically what I did.
CH
There were no more chairs?
RF
There were no more chairs. No, correction. There was one more chair, but I was reluctant to sit in it just
for the fact of what just happened. But that chair, I would have had to walk all the way around to go sit
down there. But I said, “You know what? No. I will stand against the wall and observe.”
CH
Do you think that happened because of your color?
RH
I felt it did, and the reason why I will say that is because that whole unit as I speak to you today is
predominantly Caucasian. Even as I had a chance to walk into the ICU-side of that same unit, it’s
predominantly white.
CH
No other culture?
RF
No.
CH
You’re a trailblazer.
RF
I've seen two other Filipinos, but that was later on, you know. I've seen two other Filipinos. So now, that
happened that day in there.
24
afc2021009_015
CH
What did Renee do?
RF
Nothing.
CH
What about afterwards? Did she introduce herself to you?
RF
Well, she ended up introducing herself because I made the notation that, “Do you guys know Renee?”
That's when she said, “Oh, it's me. You're gonna be shadowing me.” That was it. It wasn't, “Oh,” you
know, “sorry about what happened in there. I should have said something. I didn't know it was you.” As
I'm speaking to you today, none of that ever happened, even as of today.
CH
Is that the person you're gonna be shadowing?
RF
Yes, that who I'm going to be shadowing still, her and one other person. So, I went on with her, follow
her with my backpack still on my shoulder and we went to the nurse's station now, because now you get
to, you know, change over. Now you meet the nurses that had the rooms that were assigned to them the
night that you're now taking over in the morning. I go and I'm standing literally at the nurse's station. Of
course, between the nurse's station and the rooms, there's more than enough space. So, radiology
generally have their machine that they're coming through the floors with on whoever has to get a scan
done. I kid you not, I know I was so hooked up onto the nurse's station because this is my first time
taking a report, so I have my own documentation, trying to take report that Renee is also taking. This
lady with the machine, and I mean, I kid you not, she goes by the first time then hit me, which I'm still in
the same position. I never moved, bag’s still on my shoulder. But, I guess she finally finished what she's
doing in the room that she went into and came back and hit me with the machine. This is all in the same
day now, my first day. This is why I said I felt like I was being hazed. Not once did she say, “Oh, my
apologies,” or, “I'm sorry.” I looked. I was like, “Oh my god,” you know, like, “You hit me and you
knocked my bag off my shoulder,” but she kept on going. I said, “Well, is there something that
somebody didn't tell me that I should be aware of, what I should know?” I said, “Okay.” That was my
second thing. The third thing that happened was as the day's going on, me and this-- So, I'm now behind
the nurse's station and I’m at a computer and I'm getting information. The young lady is sitting next to
me. We didn't have no words. No, “Hello”, no anything. No, “Hey, so where are you from?” No
conversation. So, I'm right here and my preceptor’s on this side kinda show me something and there's,
once again, there's a station, I mean, a drawer or a cabinet that sits right there where, you know, they
allow people to put their bags and, you know, I had already put my bag there, but there's still that space
between her and I. Next thing I know, my chair get kicked and I look and I'm like, “What?” Okay. Well,
“Why did you kick my chair?” She gets up, keep walking. I'm still trying to figure out, “Well, why did
you kick the chair?” but there's one of those. It wasn't that she scooted over. I can understand that. Okay,
well, maybe because there's wheels and it’s, like-- I'm thinking to myself, “Okay, this is not a good first
day. I don't think this is the unit that I want to be on.” I just look at that and it was like, “Okay, this is not
inviting, you know. It's not making me feel comfortable.” Later on, I found out that there is another, you
25
afc2021009_015
know, African-American person on the unit and she's been there, I think, twenty-five years, but she
started as a tech, you know, and worked her way up to being a nurse. Once again, as I'm speaking to you
today, me and her, we've never had any dialogue at all, at all, saying, “Hey, my name is so and so,” you
know.
CH
The person you were sitting next to.
RF
Well, not the person I was sitting next to but I'm speaking of the other young lady that’s
African-American like myself that's on that unit that’s been in for 25 years. She's never uttered a word to
me and I've never said anything back, you know. I'm thinking to myself, “If I come work on this unit and
you've been here all these years, I will look at you as somebody that I will want to learn from because
you've been here for so long.” We've never had a single word so, you know, I just look at it that that
diversity that I'm looking for and that, I guess, kind of, like, family orientation type of feeling of
knowing that I'll have the security of being able to go to somebody or ask questions or have that, you
know, I don't feel that it's there. But, I'm willing to make the best of it, because it's just gonna be
something that I'll be able to learn and say, “Okay, you know what? I have the opportunity to, you know,
be in a challenging position and knowing how to figure it out. How can I help somebody else, you know,
that will go through that?” That’s part of the reason why I told my classmate, “Don't leave that unit. I
want us to, you know, be a change.” It's like, watching it, and this is what I'm talking to you about right
now. I've had that conversation where I said, “I've noticed that you'll say, ‘Hi. Hello,’ and nothing comes
back,” you know, I said, “but that's not the type of person that I am,” you know. I said, “And, you know,
you do look for that to come back and say, ‘Oh, hey. Hi. Oh, hey,’ you know, ‘it's okay.’” This is how
you know, people, and I said, “I've noticed my whole 12 weeks, I’ve come in and every time I've
spoken, people barely saying anything.”
CH
That happened the whole 12 weeks?
RF
People barely said anything.
CH
What about the relationship with you and the preceptor?
RF 1:17:12
I mean, that was kinda okay. We had a rocky point because the schedule that she had had a major
conflict with my schedule. She was going on vacation and her schedule, once again, she had a lot of
daytime schedule. I had classes on those days, so what I asked her was, when she gave me the okay, I
said, “Is it okay if I give another person's schedule so I can also match it up between yours and that
person?” I only said that person because that was the person that I shadowed on my very first day that I
was there, you know, to see how the unit was. The gentleman name was Paul. She said, “Yeah, yeah.
Sure. It's okay.” Per her okay, I got his schedule and talked to him as well and so they both knew. So,
now I came up with a schedule that I said will work to help so that way, it doesn't have a major conflict
with my schedule for classes. Then all of a sudden was like, “Oh, no. You can't do that.” Once again, I
26
afc2021009_015
did not want to be that person to make it seem like I'm trying to dictate, so I said, “Sure.” I said, “Well,
whatever works for you guys, you guys let me know, but these are the days that I'm in class.” Then, on
top of that, I have an exam that was coming up on some of the days that I said, “I can't even work that
night schedule and leave in enough time when the exam starts at eight o'clock in the morning. I'm just
getting ready to leave here.” I said, “It's impossible.” “Oh, well, you know, you can't have two
preceptors. You can only have one.” I said, “Okay, fine.” I said, “You let me know what works best.
You're going on vacation next week. The other gentleman, his schedule is, you know, it's not as flexible
either, so what do I do?” “Oh, he's charge nurse. ‘Cause he's charge nurse at times, it's gonna be hard for
him to have, you know, a student.” I said, “Okay, well, then you let me know.” Now, mind you, as the
days start going on, later on, now she wanted to assign me to somebody. I said, “But when I asked, it
was not okay.” To the point that I think my very last day, I actually was assigned to somebody because
she had somebody else. So, I just tried to figure it out that you made it hard for me to give you a
schedule that worked to help me out as you know that I'm a student, which you were once a student
yourself. You're not even that far along from graduating. You're only a year in. I had a preceptor that was
just a year in, you know, so it's like, you know, I just looked at it that to me, that was, you know, I don't
know. Looking at the morale and, like, the behaviors, I saw the togetherness with some of them. I really
saw it, and I said, “Okay.” So, I would just, you know, sit there and, you know, just do what they asked
me to do and just keep my head down. So, what I did was I spoke to my instructor, who was also an
African American, that I had for my Saturday clinical and I told her the challenge that I was having. She
gave me a very good point. She's also part of Chi. Her name is Dr. Simpana [spelling?], Erica Simpana. I
told her, I said, “This is,” I said, “it’s frustrating me.” She said to me, she said, “This is the reason why.
One: you're a man. You're a man with a deep voice. Your voice almost carries a command. You're
intimidating, so you have to learn how to tone that down.” I said, “I never looked at in that sense.” She
said, “I’m gonna tell you why.” I said, “Please do,” I said, “because I'm open. I need help.” She said,
“When I ask you to do something, your voice was so strong and what you felt you knew that I had to
pull you to let you know, ‘No. I want you to do it this way,’” she said, “but you don't scare me.” “Well, I
wasn't trying to scare you.” She said, “But that's what happens. So now, when you have, you know, these
other people, white people, Caucasians, and you're so strong--”
CH
And you're Black.
RF
“And you’re Black, it’s gonna be a problem.” I said, “I never looked at it in that way.” When she told me
that so early on, that's what allowed me to bury my head down a little bit better and to say, “You know
what? I gotta watch how I'm projecting what I'm saying. I got to be a little bit more relaxed, more of a
down tone, more of as if I'm being submissive in a sense.” I said, “Okay,” and that's what I did. From
that, for me, I'm like, “Okay,” but it allowed me to get through those clinical practicum, to say, “Not a
problem.” I think as they saw me as the person, which I'm, one: I was also being myself, that I would get
up and immediately go help that patient or go help that, you know. Whatever they asked, I’m like,
“Okay, no problem.” It was so many times that, you know, people say, “Hey, do you want to, you know,
want to learn how to take out a catheter or a Foley or whatever?” I'm like, “Yeah, I'll do it.” At that
practicum, I was always the first to, you know, to say, “Sure, sure, sure. Not a problem.” So, I think with
them seeing that, some of them opened up a couple of times to speak to me. Well, prior to, they wanted
to be [inaudible 1:23:21], you know. There wasn't a single word that was uttered my direction besides,
27
afc2021009_015
“Oh man, you have all white. Your school allows you to wear all white?” That was it. That was the only
conversation, because of what I had on.
CH
Kind of a hostile environment for, as you said, the hazing for the newbie.
RF
For the newbie.
CH
Let’s move on now to our beloved Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated.
RF
Yes.
CH
How did you become involved?
RF 1:23:49
I became involved when-- I had heard about Chi Eta Phi. I can't remember who it was. It was one of the
instructor, came into our class. This was during my junior year, came in and talked about Chi Eta Phi. I
said, “Think about it.” She said then, “And they take men too!” I was like, “Okay,” because, you know, I
knew nothing about, you know, Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated. I knew nothing about it. I knew about
the other, you know, organizations. The D 9, I knew about that, but when she explained it so well and
stated that, you know, “It's a nursing sorority,” and I said, “Well, I guess I'm going into nursing so I’ll
look into it.” That was my junior year. So, the beginning of my senior year, we had classes together but I
don't know what happened. She wasn't in my class that day. They were set up outside and they were
giving us, you know, they were giving gifts out. I remember saying to her-- Her name is Soror Dotty,
and I said to her, I said, “Do you mind if I talk to you after class?” She was like, “Yeah.” I said, you
know, “I’d like to know more about it and I'm actually interested in joining,” and she was like, “Sure,
sure, sure.” She said, “Well, we have a, you know, a class that we're trying to bring in, you know. I'll tell
you more about it. Give me your number.” So, we exchanged numbers. Mind you, all this time, we never
really had [inaudible 1:25:37]. I said, “Well, I'm interested.” So, she kept in contact with me and let me
know when they were doing the interest meeting. I said, “Sure.” Went to the interest meeting and, you
know, heard a couple of the, you know, sorors speaker, you know, there and I was like, “Yeah,” I said,
you know, “absolutely,” and, you know, “I’m a man. I, you know, definitely, you know, would love to,”
because I liked the fact that what I heard my junior year, you know, how we're involved in the
community, how, you know, they're very involved in, you know, making sure that we grow as an
organization, also helping you grow within the nursing field. I said, “You know what? I’m in.” I said,
“No questions.” So, I remember talking to my wife about it and my wife stated that, “Yeah, yeah, yeah.”
She's like, you know, “For sure, you know. I think it’s a good idea.” She said, you know, “I wanted to
join, you know, but at that time, you know, my grades, I was more focused on my grades, you know, so I
really, you know.” I said, “Well, it's not too late. You could join in. We’ll be, you know, a power couple
innit?” So, you know, going through, I was like, “Okay. This is it.” I said, “I really like the
organization.” Even right now with my father passing, my chapter was so nice that, you know, they got
together and they, you know, were able to help with some of the funeral arrangements. I appreciate them.
28
afc2021009_015
I told him, I said, “Look, you have a friend for life, you know. Whenever you need me, whatever it is
that you need done, you know, please, by all means.” I just got involved and we started doing a lot of
things in the community. It was so funny and interesting to see that I was already doing stuff in the
community anyway. I said, “Service for humanity.” I said, “Look, I can show you guys some stuff.” I
said, “I've been doing this long before I ever knew that, you know, Chi Eta Phi did this.” We started
doing so many community outreach and I was taking them places where I was going and, I mean, we
were just together. I mean, I have pictures. I have pictures of us, you know, doing things and it was
good, you know. My sisters, you know, my line sisters, I got them involved. I told them, I said, “Look.
Listen, we could do this every day, you know. I have so many different places that I go to that I already
provide for.” That was just, you know, it was a big thing for me. It was a big thing for me, that helping
one another. The one that really, really, really, really I was so appreciative of is NER. I went to NER and
I saw the amount of us that was together and it was there, the positivity, the, you know, the fact that how
the mentorship, you know, and that, and I said, “I cannot ask for any other organization to join,” you
know. That made me smile so much. I think maybe it was two or three other fraters that I have had a
chance to see, you know, and I was just, I was excited, you know. It was well put together, you know,
and I mean, what else can I ask for, you know. What else can I ask for? It was lovely, you know. It was
very lovely. So, that, to me, I felt that, you know, this is where I needed to be and I made a good
decision.
CH
NER. You mentioned NER. What does that stand for?
RF
National Eastern Region is what it stands for.
CH
So, what region are you in?
RF
I’m in the northern eastern region, sorry.
CH
Northeast region.
RF
Northeast region, yes.
CH
What chapter are you in?
RF
I’m in Gamma Alpha Beta.
CH
Gamma Alpha Beta. That's the undergraduate chapter for Baltimore.
29
afc2021009_015
RF
Yeah, that was the undergraduate chapter for Baltimore, yes.
CH
Do you feel that you will go on and join the graduate chapter?
RF
Absolutely, absolutely. I will, I will. I want to stay connected, more so is because of not only what we do
for the community, but the support, the support that-- from the sponsor, the support from one of our
chapters leader, Adrienne Ray. I mean, she's at every event there to support us, you know.
CH
Now, Adrienne is with the graduate chapter that helps out the undergraduate chapter?
RF
Yeah.
CH
She was the sponsor for the undergraduate chapter?
RF
Well, one of our sponsors was Dr. Akins-Smith, but she's our charter member. I'm sorry. She's our
charter member is Adrienne Ray. She's been supportive. Every event, she's there, you know, supporting
us and, you know, and being there. I mean, I can't even ask for more from her because she's really
showing us the way, you know. Whatever is needed, if there's any questions or anything like that, she's
there to support us, you know. That’s big. To me, it's that right there alone, just having that type of
support. Once again, like I mentioned earlier, I'm a family man and for me, that's family, you know. If I
consider you family, you could get anything out of me.
CH
It is a brotherhood/sisterhood organization. That's one of our primary tenets in the organization, in Chi
Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated. You also have your own business. Can you tell us a little bit about that?
RF 1:31:12
Yes. So, I started this business over six years ago.
CH
What business is that?
RF
It's called Care Pathway, LLC. What we do is we provide services for individuals that are at home. So,
you have caregivers or PCAs, HHAs, CNAs, certified nursing assistant, as they call them, or home
health aide or personal care assistants that go into the home and take care of individuals that may have
disabilities, elderlies that, you know, might need assistance. We provide for them their daily needs, their,
you know, ADLs. That's what we do. So, I started working in this field 11 years ago. Actually, this year
will make it 11 years, in 2011, where I was running somebody else's business for them.
30
afc2021009_015
CH
The same type of business?
RF
The same type of business. I remember, I think two years in with that company, I remember asking the
owner of the company, you know, “How much would you sell your company for if you were to sell it?”
and he gave me the figures. He said about 5 million or so at that time. I said, “Okay.” The reason why I
asked that was because I noticed what I started to do for his business, ‘cause I was increasing his, you
know, the income that was coming into his business. I said, “Well, if I'm doing this and he wants 5
million,” I said, “well, why don't I start one myself?” So, as I continued to work for him, I started
looking into how to start what they call a RSA, residential service agency, underneath the COMAR
Rules and Regulations. I said, “Okay.” Went through, had a lady that specialized in RSA, paid her for
her services and she was able to assist me with all the policies and procedures. Submitted the documents
to the state of Maryland, and when it was submitted to them, it literally took almost two years to get the
provisional and then you had to wait for the approval. Two years for it to get approved. Once it got
approved, it really sat idle because I was still working for that company and I just felt that, “Listen,
you're still working for this company. This is guaranteed money,” you know.
CH
It was banking.
RF
It was banking. So, I said, “Okay, you know what?” I was getting frustrated with myself. I said, “I know
I could do this on my own.” Not only that, I was having that battle with myself in going back to school. I
wanted to go back to college and I felt it. I'm like, “I have to go back. I have to get my degree. I have to
complete. I've been procrastinating. Enough is enough.” So, roughly 2016, 2017, I said, “That's it. I'm
going.” So, I resigned from that company, started kind of having this brew a little bit and I knew I had
the network of people I could reach out to.
CH
Now, this company you’re talking about is your own company?
RF
Is my own company. So, I said, “Okay, time to put, you know, Care Pathway in the forefront.” I did that
along with going to school, but I managed to save as much as I can that I knew if I walk away, I will be
okay to sustain myself, you know. At the time, I didn't have my, you know, my first child yet and it was
just myself and my wife and we were already married. I said, “Okay. We'll be able to sustain. Not a
problem.” So, I started that and in school, so school became the primary, business became secondary.
So, I'm in class. When I finished, I'll come here. I'll set up, you know, try to work on getting clients and
whatever was necessary. So, I remember having this conversation with one of my good friends and I told
him, I said, “Look, I'm not building a clientele yet and I don't want to make it seem as if I'm taking the
clients from the old company that I left.” I said, “I don't want to reach out to what they call case
managers,” because I had their number. They knew me very well. They knew my work ethic and they
knew what I did for that other company. I said, “Well, I don't want to step on anybody's toes.” He said,
“Well, look. Business is business. If your work ethic is what you're saying it is, then reach out to those
case managers. Let them know you started your own company.” I battled with that for, like, a month. I
31
afc2021009_015
said, “I don't feel right doing it.” So, I finally did. Come to find out these individuals are out actually
looking for me. They was like, “What happened to you? We stopped referring business to that company
because you were no longer there.” When I tell you the smile that came on my face, and I said, “Wow!”
Ever since then, my company started growing, you know. Year after every year as I've been in business
that, you know, my sales been increasing, you know, and I just, I couldn't believe it. I was like, “Well,
okay.” So, I was doing things right. I did do things right, you know, and I laid a path and here I am. So,
you know, six years in, I'm, you know, I've been here and just still continue to grow, you know. So, I
completed the, you know, my first degree and I've completed my second degree, all while still running a
business and running a family.
CH
You're really busy. We have an inside joke. Your name is Mr. Famous.
RF
Mr. Famous [both laugh].
CH
So, Mr. Famous, you are such a multi-tasker and so very, very talented and driven.
RF
I’m very driven.
CH
Driven, compassionate.
RF
Yes.
CH
Honest.
RF
Yes.
CH
Mr. Famous.
RF
Yes, Mr. Famous. I'm very driven, and I'm not even done yet.
CH
Yes. Do you still have aspiration after you go through this initial trauma experience to go into ICU?
RF 1:37:17
I do, but then I also-- So, I have three things that I've mapped out for myself. ICU is one of my options,
more so because of connections that I've made along my transition of going through clinical and
32
afc2021009_015
speaking to different individuals that are in different positions. I had the opportunity to run into a
gentleman that have been with University and has been in the anesthesia position for 22 years, and I
managed to, you know, switch contact information with him. I told him, you know, once I come on
board, I'm actually gonna shoot him an email letting him know that I'm now working at the University of
Maryland so I can build that relationship, because he seemed like the type that wants to be a mentor. I
appreciate mentors because that's how I've managed to get where I've been, you know, is following, you
know, somebody, asking questions about things that I do not know or things that I, you know, I'm not
pertinent to, so that is an option. I also look at my age as a deterrent, but I don't want it to be, because as
of right now, I am 44 years old, so to go through that step is another three-year process that I'm looking
at. So, that's one option. The second option is to go through and actually do the DNP program, which is
the Doctorate of Nursing Practitioner. That's very high on my mind right now, way more than the ICU is.
Reason being is that I thought of doing family practice as of recent, and it was something that I wanted
to do without taking a break. But, through advice, I was told, “Take a break. Get in, get your feet wet
and, you know, and from that point on, then you can try, you know, see if you still want to do the DNP.”
I said, “Okay. I'll give myself two years. Within two years, I will work for a little while, see the field,
make my connections and then maybe go into the DNP program.”
CH
Well, I was mentioning the ICU option because you mentioned that you had to go through that in order
to become an anesthetist.
RF
Correct.
CH
Is that something that you still want to do or are you just [inaudible 1:40:03]?
RF
Well, that’s why I said it’s in there and within my scope, because with the University of Maryland, they
don't hire new grads into ICU, so I have to stay at IMC--
CH
About a year?
RF
About a year and hoping that a position does come open in ICU. So, that's why I said it's not off the
table. So, if I do get the opportunity to get into ICU, I will take it.
CH
What about at another hospital?
RF
At another hospital?
CH
For ICU.
33
afc2021009_015
RF
I mean, if the position is there, I'm all for it, you know. I'm all for it. If I get the opportunity, I'm all for it,
but as far as I’ve heard that we're able to get into ICU, they want you to have that year of experience
anyway, so that's why I said it's not off the table for me, you know. It is something that will be around
because, you know, I do want to, you know, and the fact that I feel that I could probably build that
relationship with this gentleman and hopefully, maybe, he could guide me. What he suggested things
that you want to do after your first year having the experience in the ICU, and he said, “Look, first year
in, you can still submit, you know?” and I said, “Okay. Well, that's not bad. Then that's not all kind of
going to waste in a sense, or at least it’s not delaying a whole lot that after my first year of having the
ICU experience, you know, then I can at least, you know, start putting into or, you know, put my
applications out there, you know, for an anesthetist program.” So, I said, “Okay. That's not a bad idea.”
CH
You know, you're in love with putting in applications.
RF
So, I said, you know, “That's an opportunity.” You know, the DNP was a thing that, you know, that I also
thought about. That partly was something that was motivated by my father, because he got his doctorate.
Even though his was in theology, I-- One of the things that I mentioned and made promise to was to
carry on the name. So, since his name was Dr. Fajimolu, I want my name to be Dr. Fajimolu, so I'm still
carrying on the name.
CH
That’s it. That’s it.
RF
So, those are my two that are in. My third thing is, I have another business plan that I've been working
on.
CH
Okay.
RF
So, this is not it [chuckles]. That business plan still involves healthcare. So, I started it. I need to get
board members and I also need to do policies and procedures, which, once again, that probably will take
another two years, you know, because it’s also another state program, you know, through state of
Maryland. So, I have three things within my scope.
CH
Okay. What is that business?
RF
Sure, sure. It’s called DDA, which stands for Developmentally Disabled Adults. So, it's basically
assisting individuals with intellectual disabilities. You house them and you are pretty much responsible
for their needs, for their daily needs. So, once again, it's something that is similar to this but just on a
more of a higher scale, because they're actually living in homes that you will have--
34
afc2021009_015
CH
A group home.
RF
A group home that you will have.
CH
Or, assisted living.
RF
Or assisted living type of setting so, yeah, so which, you know, is more hands-on. It's something that I
actually used to do, you know, as a part-time job, so I know the scope of it and I've always had an
interest in it. So, I ran an assisted living in the past, so since that is similar to assisted living, I said, you
know, “Why not? Why not?” So, that's, yeah. The more you know me, the more you'll know this guy is
always thinking about the next step. I'm always thinking about the next step. Even my wife gets tired of
hearing me, you know, ‘cause I'm always telling her. This morning, she said to me, she's like, “We have
to talk.” I said, “Yeah.” I said, “We do have to talk.” I said, “We have to talk about your next step.” I
said, “What's your plan?” you know, “What's your plan?” I said, “You need to let me know.” So, as
we've made a household, we both talked about her next plan is now she's also inquiring about the DNP.
So, I said, “Good.” I said, “Well, that's fine.” So, I said, I said, “Yeah, we'll, you know, be in a house and
we'll have our kids and we'll have our wall full of, you know, accolades that, you know, that will show
them that, you know, that they can do it no matter their age, you know, that they'll be able to do it.”
CH
She also has to join Chi Eta Phi Gamma chapter [laughs].
RF
I already told her. I said, “Without question,” you know. The good thing is I brought her around my
sisters. I brought around other, you know, my other sorors so she could see, you know, what they’re
about and what they do and how included, you know, we are. She sees it and she's a big supporter. She's
a big supporter, you know. She sees it and, you know. I told her, you know, “Don't worry. It's not too
late, you know. We have our, you know, our Gamma chapter, you know, that you'll be able to join.” So
yeah, we're gonna be good.
CH
What advice would you give for other men who might be considering nursing as a career?
RF
Do not be afraid. Do not be afraid. Come in with the mindset to learn, be open-minded, be a sponge, you
know, be receptive. Don't be afraid of the challenge, because it’s challenging, you know. The nursing
program itself is challenging. So, don't be afraid of the challenge, you know. Find a mentor, you know.
Whether it's another male or whether it's a female, find a mentor. For me, I think that goes a long way.
Just, you know, just be ready. Just be ready, ‘cause even as a man and as strong as I may look, I had my
times, you know, where I isolated myself, you know. I was stressed, you know. I was depressed, you
know, and then I came out of it, and, you know, just faced the challenge. So, just be prepared. Don't be
scared. Don't be scared and come in and be ready.
35
afc2021009_015
CH
What would you say to male nurses about joining Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated?
RF 1:47:03
Okay, so the biggest part is, do not let the part of sorority scare you, because that's the first thing that
they're gonna see. “Oh, but it says sorority.” Okay. It’s okay. Come on in, you know. Ask the questions.
See where you fit in, you know, and understand that it's more than just what the name appears to be. Just
look at me, you know, is what I would tell them. Ask questions, you know. I think that's one of the
things that I brought up before. When I was asked, it was like, you know, “You're--" especially on
campus, you know. “You're the guy that joined,” you know. I say, “Yes. Join us if you want to know
more,” you know. ‘Cause when I wear my, you know, my gear and they see my number 10 on the bag,
they see my, you know, service for humanity and they see Chi Eta Phi, you know, wear it proudly, you
know. I made a stamp on campus, you know. They see it, you know. I'm speaking for even the D 9
individuals that see it and they applaud and, you know, they know who we are, you know. They know
who he is, you know, and they understand a little bit better. But, I think it's all about teaching as well. If
they don't know, you know, they can only speculate that, “But it's a women’s sorority.” It’s for both. It's
inclusive.
CH
Yes, because it's a professional organization which happens to be called a sorority.
RF
That's it, you know. We had a meeting, and I remember bringing this up when we had our meeting. I
said, you know, “Did we ever consider, you know, just leaving it at Chi Eta Phi?” The [inaudible
1:48:58] was like, “No.” I said, “You know, it’s a deterrent for a lot of men.” “Yeah.” I said, you know,
“I'm a walking billboard, but when they see that, it's still a challenge, you know.” I said, “But, you know,
if there's ever consideration,” I said, you know, “or we could say, you know, I have something that
piggyback on it or something so they know that it's okay. Come on in,” you know. ‘Cause I will tell you,
while I was on campus, I went to a couple of the juniors, “You're coming to Chi Eta Phi,” you know.
[Inaudible 1:49:42]. It was one, he was actually Nigerian like myself. I can't remember his name, but I
said to him, I said, “You're joining.” He was like, “What?” I said, “No.” I said, “You're joining.” I said,
“One: we’re Nigerian, and two: we’re guys and you're joining.” So, he said, “Okay,” you know, and I
said, “I'll be back,” you know, and just to let ‘em know, like, you know, it's inclusive. I say, “This is an
organization that's gonna look out for you and, you know, you're not gonna feel like you don't belong.
No. You belong. We belong.”
CH
Another identifier, however, of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated is that we say we are a professional
nurse organization.
RF
True.
36
afc2021009_015
CH
So that part of our title, although it's not official, but just to help people, men, become a little more
comfortable with it. The motto of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated is service for humanity. Can you
give us some words of wisdom about that?
RF
So, service for humanity, which for me goes a long way, is including the people in our community,
donating. I mean, even there were challenges that we had on campus from the other D 9 that we match
or even surpass in donating, you know, perishables, non-perishables, and showing that we just don't have
it as our motto, we actually exemplify it by showing you that we are there, by inviting you to come to,
you know, the locations of where we are. Actually, I will even give you another one that we did that was
on campus that we did with another organization, where we championed-- It was for Women's
Awareness Month in March, so we did a defense class. It was the [inaudible 1:51:49] crew who we
invited, you know, so they can see we're doing something for Women's Awareness Month on how to
defend themselves. But, not only did we invite the women, but we invited the men as well. So, it was a
huge class of men and women learning defense tactics, you know, not only for the people on campus,
but just to be aware of your surroundings whenever you're, you know, out and about. That's just small
things that, you know, that you will look at, but it goes a long way, you know, for the community. It goes
a long way for the people on campus. Us providing services for the less fortunate at the underpass of 83
and Baltimore, where there’s this company that's called Global, that we are there every, you know, every
first Saturday of the month providing food, helping serve, you know, food for the community, providing
clothing, blankets, anything that's necessary. Even us as a organization collecting donations that we're
providing, you know, out to the community. So, that’s service for humanity for me. When I saw that, it
was something that showed me, like, “Okay, this is it, you know. This is what I've been talking about,
you know, for organizations to be, you know, involved in the community.” So, it goes a long way. I think
the more people are around us and the more people see us put this, you know, through our website and
actually see us, it makes them understand us a lot better, you know. Besides that we're a professional
organization, but it's also showing that not only are we professional, but we’re also committed to the
community, you know. So that, to me, it goes a long way. It goes a long way.
CH
I thank you so much Frater Fajimolu.
RF
Fajimolu.
CH
Fajimolu.
RF
There you go. Think of Quasimodo. Go back and do it again.
CH
I’ll try to not botch that up [both laugh].
37
afc2021009_015
RF
No worries.
CH
I thank you so much for participating and for just sharing so much of your existence and, yeah,
everything that you have offered to society for service for humanity as a male nurse, a family man. I
really appreciate that. You will be a part of history with the Archie Green Folklife Occupational Project.
Mr. Famous, I just want to thank you so much again for participating and just thank you.
RF
No, I thank you. I really appreciate the opportunity, you know. I know it's gonna go a long way and I
hope it helps, you know, not only somebody else but somebody else that’s a man as myself, that’s in this
position that thinks about, you know, joining Chi Eta Phi. That it helps other individuals that are, you
know, in the position to make decisions for anybody else to think and look beyond just themselves to
understand that, you know, whatever decisions you make, whatever you do has an impact on somebody
else's life, you know. So, that's one of the things for me that I will always, you know, hope that we all, as
human beings, as humanity, will always put in focus that what I do, what I say, who I am, where I am
makes an impact on somebody else. So, I really appreciate you guys giving me the opportunity. Mr.
Famous is gonna be my new name anytime somebody calls me.
CH
That's right! We're gonna have that on record. Mr. Famous. Thank you so much. Have a good day.
RF
You too.
