STROLLING IN THE WOODLAND. 
Words by JOHN J. 
McNALLY. Great Swell Song, as used by the 
RYANS at H ARRY M INER'S THEATRE. N. 
Y. Copyrighted, 1879, 
by Louts P. GOULARD. All rights reserved. 
Strolling in the woodland, 
Where the rippling waters glide; 
There 'twas Mary Anthus said, 
She'd become my bride; 
Her eyes outshone the starlight, 
Her voice was melody; 
Do you remember, loved one, 
I 
won a 
smile from thee. 
For my heart was light and free, 
When I 
won a 
smile from thee. 
Cuoitus: 
Strolling in the woodland, 
Where the rippling waters glide; 
Oh, there ' twas Mary Anthus said, 
She'd become my bride. 
There our vows we plighted 
By the perfumed mignonette; 
Vows of love, my darling, 
That I 
can ne'er forget; 
Do you regret the day, love, 
You gave your heart to me; 
As strolling in the woodland, 
I 
won a 
smile from thee. 
For my heart was light and free, 
When I 
won a 
smile from thee. 
Words by PERRY RYAN, and sung by the RYANS with great success. 
(RyANs Specialty Swell Song). 
While strolling on the pier the other night, 
Scarce knowing what to do; 
I 
watched the curling waves in the pale moonlight, 
Beneath the sky so blue; 
But a 
form to me that seemed divinely fair, 
Appeared, though the hour was growing late; 
I 
asked my charmer's name, she said your not to 
Did this pretty little charming Blue-eyed Kate. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, my, my pretty Blue-eyed Kate,--(Break.) 
So loving and so sedate. —(Brealc.) 
Both standing on the pier that moonlight night, 
Though the hour was growing late; 
She said I'm thine will you be mine 
Did this pretty little charming Blue-eyed Kate. 
Once more I 
stand and watch the rolling sea, 
That seems to me to tell; 
Of days now gone by how then was I. 
With the joys that me befell; 
But the greatest one of all my hopes in life, 
Was one evening when at eight; 
She joined her hand in mine, saying truly I 
am thine, 
Did this pretty little charming Blue-eyed Kate. 
Composed and sung by ANDY CoLLom with great success at " Miner's 
Theatre " and the " London." 
Air :—" Empty is the Cradle Baby's Gone." 
Empty is 
is the bar the dutchman fired the bums, 
The cop is snoring loudly on his beat, 
The lager keg is busted the lunch was all chewed up, 
Except some second-handed old pigs feet; 
The gang has all skedaddled and carried off the plates, 
Others up to sing sing now have flown, 
The rest are in the workhouse where no lager they get, 
For empty is the keg the beer is gone. 
Empty is the plates, vanished is the hash, 
The moldy cheese and liverworst has flown, 
The smell of old limburger haunts the place no more 
For empty is the bar the beer is gone. 
They get the dutchman crazy when he goes to sleep, 
He scares the rats around him with his snore, 
He's dreaming of the boys who stood him off for drinks, 
And swears he'll never trust again some more; 
But now the place is busted, the bums are in the park, 
Skirmishing with the sparrows for a 
bed; 
On the bench you bear the call let's have another ball. 
But empty is the bar the dutchman's dead,

I 
wish my love and I 
was sailing, 
As far from land as far could be, 
War, far across the deep blue water, 
Where I'd have none to trouble me. 
CHORUS— 
Sweet Maggie Gordon you are my bride, 
Come sit you down upon my knee, 
And tell to me the very reason 
Why I 
am slighted thus by thee. 
The sea is deep, I 
can't swim over, 
Neither have I 
the wings to fly, 
But I 
will hire some jolly sportsman, 
To carry o'er my love and I. 
Sweet Maggie Gordon, &t.. 
I 
wish I 
had a 
glass of brandy. 
The reason I 
will tell to thee, 
Because when drinking, I 
am thinking, 
Does my true love remember me.

Words and Music by BONNIE RUNNELLS. Sung with great succetks 
You talk about your drummers— 
Ve're der finest in der corps— 
Ye 
our dime in sixdy-nine, 
In de Franco-Prussian War ; 
Ye got medals from King William, 
Vidal we justly do deserve, 
For drumming- in dat army, yes, 
And displaying, spunk and nerve. 
CuoP.m.: 
For yen you see us brave huzzars, 
Our helmets shine, just like der stars. 
Our noble flag shows many a 
scar, 
For we are known as der brave huzzars. 
De Americans love der nation, 
And der Germans, too, der same, 
For fighting for our liberty, 
Dat is our greatest fame; 
Yen ve meet oder regiments, 
No jealousy we show, 
Ve lend a 
helping hand to all, 
No matter high or low.

YOU COULD HAVE BEEN TRUE. 
Written by MANNIE FRIEND. 
Dedicated to THEODORE ALLEN, Esq. 
Copyrighted by B. W. 
HITCHCOCK. 1881, 166 Nassau Street, New York. 
Sent by Mail on receipt of 40 cents. 
:o: 
Though silence and coldness have us parted forever, 
I 
have come to tell, with deep pain in my heart, 
For the sake of the past and the love you once bore 
Oh ' twere but right that we in friendship should part. 
Even now, while the wound you inflicted is aching. 
A voice in my heart pleads in soft tones for you; 
Who wavered and faltered, were fickle and altered, 
Oh, why were you false, when you could have been true? 
Cuours, 
Why were you false, why so unkind, 
How could you forget one who lived but for you? 
The vows that were spoken, by you have been broken, 
Farewell forever, why were you untrue? 
Long years may elapse, and my 'name be forgotten, 
Although you once feared was my love for you true, 
bit my love you accepted, first craved, then neglected, 
Whate'er unto others, I 
was faithful to you. 
New pleasures may greet you, new faces may meet you, 
New loves for a 
time your heart may entwine; 
Their friendship though newer, can never be truer, 
Or ever as tender or faithful as mine. ( Chorus).

GEM OF THE EMERALD ISLE. 
ords and Music by PAT FZENEY, and dedicated and sung by 
JOHN WALsh, the Great Irish Vocalist, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, N. Y. 
I'll sing now IA 
praise of the gem of old Ireland, 
Whose names are respected by friend and by foe; 
Of the men who proud to acknowledge their sireland, 
Of men who gained fame by words and by blow; 
Their hearts brave and true, never knew any danger, 
As cheerfully they tor their country did toil; 
It must be acknowledged by friend cid by stranger, 
That they were bright tints from the Emeral Isle. 
First is Brian Borne, the great King whose example 
If followed by Monarchs of this present day; 
A. blessing would prove, foe his wi ,Aoin was ample, 
He knew how to rule in a 
true Kingly way; 
Brave Patrick Sarsfield, exiled from his sireland, 
Exclaimed as he died on a 
foreigner's soil; 
Oh, may Heaven grant freedom for old Ireland, 
Then died a 
bright gem of the Emerald Isle. 
If we boast of our gents, surely no one can blame us, 
When we've produced men like those I 
will name; 
Balfe Wallace and Tom Moore who made themselve. 
famous, 
With music and poetry they gained their fame; 
There's Sherridan, Goldsmith and Swift, three more 
great men, 
What nation on earth ever equaled their 
There's Davitt, Daily and Killen, three more great 
Statesmen, 
Lii these are bright gems of the .Emenald Isle.

Last Winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reilly, did you say? 
Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall; 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all; 
The Politicians promised him work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel, and throw dirt on the cart, 
Ah, six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly 
get, 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him 
yet. 
Cuoncs: 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, 
Don't give away to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, 
New bonnets and new shoes; 
As for me, I'm done a 
crying, 
No more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times gets better, 
When McGuiness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, the devil take them, why didn't 
home, 
Sure we had plenty of our own class to ate up 
They come out like bees in Summer time and 
stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty 
they stay at 
all our own; 
sworn for to 
cents a 
day, 
WHEN 3ICGUDTESS GETS A JOB.—CONTi.NUED. 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and slush, 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they never do 
• 
get lush; 
N 
o, they always bring their money home, taste no gin or 
wine, 
4..nd that's one thing I'd like to say of your old man and 
mine. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, etc. 
11.11.! the Spring time now is coming we'll all have plenty 
work, 
UeGuiness will go back to his trade, shure he's a 
hancl 
some clerk.. 
You should see him climb the ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three-cornered box, 
The boss is always bawling, iii! there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes upward, don't let no mortar drop; 
..‘.1).! the old man he is always careful, nothing he let's 
The divil a 
word you'd hear him say to my old man at all. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, etc.

Slang phrases come up every day, 
And we hear them on the street, 
But the latest one that I 
have heard, 
To you I 
will repeat; 
On Fifth Avenue Vother day, 
Some young bloods did begin, 
Saying, " Pipe the gal in the blue silk dress, 
And watch me take it in." 
CHORES: 
Take it in! take it in! 
You bet I'll take if in. 
In churches, gin mills, thro' the town, 
Oh! everywhere we go, 
Among the sports that are known as fast, 
And the straight-laced known as slow; 
Ob everyone and everywhere 
They each think it no sin 
To scoop up the thing that they like best, 
And straightway take it in. (Chorus). 
15 
TAKE IT IN.—CoNTricutro. 
Now the pople in this world you meet 
Are various and strange: 
There's some that are free as mountain air, 
Whilst- others do arrange 
To draw their purse strings tight, 
And swear they've got no tin, 
Like the jolly old cuss that keeps this house, 
Who always takes it in. (Chorus). 
Then there are ladies with faces long, 
Would have you think them good— 
How all temptation in this lift; 
They always have withstood; 
But if you saw their inner self, 
Tho they look so meek and prim, 
just give them a 
chance with a 
nice young man, 
How quickly they'll take it in. (Chorus). 
Now before I 
conclude my song, 
There's one thing I 
would name, 
And I 
mention it right publicly, 
Without any fear or shame; 
If any of you boys ask me now 
To a 
seltzer, beer or gin, 
You can bet your own dear, sweetest life. 
This darling takes it in. (Chorus)

You have all had a 
Rose from my Angel Mother's Grave, 
And a 
Violet that I 
plucked long ago; 
But as years roll on. I 
will never once forget, 
Bow I 
loved my Angel Mother when alive. 
But there's one request I'll make, just for my mothers sake 
Don't forget it, attend to it I 
crave; 
And wLen I'm far away, remember what I 
say, 
Plant Flowers on my Angel Mother's Grave. 
CuOitos: 
Then remember what I 
say, when I 
am far away, 
And sailing o'er the dark blue sea; 
And God may bless you always, if you'll do as I 
request, 
Plant some Flowers on my Angel Mother's Grave. 
Well put a handsome marble headstone o'er Angel 
Mother's Grave, 
To remind us of the days gone by; 
knd we'll have inscribed up n 
it our Angel Mother, dear, 
With a " Cross and Crown" engraved so bright and 
clear. 
In the Springl,ime every year. we will visit that spot so 
dear, 
And ask Goe, to make us strong and brave; 
When wandering from that spot, plant a 
Sweet-Forget-
Me-Not, 
And some Orange Blossoms on Dear Mother's Grave.

COMIC CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and music 
Sung with great suocess by 
M URPHY and M ACK. 
It's very strange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks I 
hear about me every day; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is !" 
SPOKEN—As 
soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here it 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it ? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare, 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green! 
S2OKEN —
Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
Look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum— 
What is it, &c. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
pipe, 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPOKEN—Yes, they want to know if I'm natural or artificial, 
and how many of me there arc in a 
bunch, and whether I'm 
good raw I 
13..it abavl /11 they wildly ask— 
What is it, &c. 
JOLLY GOOD LUCK TO ALL. 
Sang by NED BARRY at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre Comique. 
Music puhlished at E. 
H. 
HARDINOS, 221) Bowery. 
If I 
had the power a 
gift to bestow, 
On the friends that around me I 
see, 
I'd give them the very best gift that I 
know, 
The gift that they lucky should be; 
For no matter how clever, how foolish, how wise, 
No matter how great, or how small; 
By luck more than merit, we fall or we rise, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
CHORUS: 
Here's jolly good luck to us all, my friends, 
The best of good luck to us all; 
For by luck more than merit, we rise or we fall, 
So; here's jolly good luck to us all. 
One man may be gifted with talents divine, 
But may still in obscurity live; 
While shallower mortals successfully shine, 
And take all the world has to give; 
One waits on in vain, for good fortune's caress, 
While the other some chance may befall; 
Which used to advantage results in success, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. (Chorus). 
So, up and be doing, deser:ring good luck, 
And good fortune may favor the brave; 
For some of life's prizes are won by sheer pluck, 
And are lost by the indolent slave; 
There is always one chance in the life of a 
than, 
Which, if lost, he can never recall; 
So work for it, watch for it, hope if you can, 
That there's jolly good luck for us all. (Chorus).

WHAT I'D ADVISE YOU TO DO. 
Written and Sung by M R. H ARRY W ELALING With great success al 
ToNY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Some advice I 
will give you, if you will list to me, 
On the way to get on in this land; 
If you're wealthy don't sneer at a 
man when he's down, 
For we all on life's wheel have to stand; 
And as it moves round, none of us can tell, 
how soon we may stumble and fall; 
Then, when too late, to your sorrow you'll find, 
The weakest must go to the wall. 
Choru8—So ne'er be too selfish, nor yet be too proud, 
As this world you go travelling through; 
If your wealthy why stretch out your hand to 
a 
friend, 
That's what I'd advise you to do. 
There are men in this world who are well-off and great .. 
And they have heaps of gold hoarded away; 
They ne'er are contented though riches their lot, 
But they crave on for more day by day; 
But when summoned away by the grim captain death, 
Or their tombs they grow feeble and old; 
Had they but their time to live over again, 
They freely would give up their gold. 
7/Ortco. 
Penny-wise and pound-foolish is a 
maxim you've heard, 
And I 
firmly believe it is true; 
For there lot's of young sparks get money in heaps, 
And with it don't know what to do; 
They'll refuse a 
poor man who asked for a 
coin, 
His family from hunger to save; 
And spend all they have on debauchery and drink, 
Which quickly sends them to their grave. 
Gloms. 
Speak well of the bridge that carries you o'er, 
You may one day have to cross it again; 
If to-day you're blessed with the rays of the sun, 
To- morrow may drown you in rain; 
If you're cosey and warm and not out in the storm. 
And you see a 
friend naked and bare; 
Oh ne'er let him pass by or at him look shy, 
Of your shelter pray give him a 
share.

Good Bye Polly. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY a 
t 
the Theatre Comique, 
I 
loved a 
girl named Polly, and thought that she loved me, 
So joined a 
ship to take a 
trip across the briny sea, 
And when the morning had arrived for me to sail away, 
I 
gave the lass a 
parting kiss, and then to her did say: 
CHORUS. 
Good bye Polly, I 
must leave you, 
Let us hope the parting will not grieve you, 
The ship it sails to-day, some thousand miles away; 
So think of me when I 
am on the sea. 
She vowed that she'd be true to me while I 
was away, 
And thinking what she said was right, I 
left her my half pay; 
Then with a 
sigh bid her good-bye, and as they heaved the lead, 
I 
left her standing on the shore, then jumped aboard and said; 
Goodbye, Polly, &c. 
I 
saw her in my dreams at night, I 
thought of her all day, 
But did not think that she was false to me, when far away; 
For I 
must own when I 
alone, was lying on my bed, 
I 
often woke up in a 
fright, and these words have said: 
Good bye, Polly, &c. 
Some years had passed when I 
returned, with lots of gold 
in store, 
And just you fancy my surprise, when I 
knocked at the doof, 
They told me Poll was married, she had been false to me, 
So now no r- ore 
str ,7 Oiore, I'm off again to sea. 
Good bye, Polly, & C.

HORSESHOES.

sung by him with great success. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, 1880. 
Since horseshoes are in fashion why a 
horseshoe song I'll 
sing, 
Its the latest superstition, the rriost fashionable thing, 
But the only ones 'cept horses who wear them as a 
rule, 
'To do them any good must be the jackass or the mule. 
The ladies wear the horseshoe on their fing-ers,ears and hair, 
The men wear horseshoe pins and canes, it's horseshoe 
everywhere, 
They hang awn) on the masts at sea to keep away the gales, 
There's horseshoe clocks and bootjacks, horseshoe tracks 
and horseshoe nails. 
They put a 
horseshoe at the gate to keep the witches out, 
Thin people carry a 
horseshoe for luck to make 'em stout, 
And fat folks keep the horseshoe for luck to make them thin 
Yet the bummer sells the horseshoe to the junkman to get 
The gambler carries the horseshoe his victim for to skin, 
And the victim carries a 
horseshoe to take the gambler in, 
The fisherman carries a 
horseshoe to help him make a 
haul, 
And if he catches only horseshoe fish he has no luck at all. 
They bake the bread in horseshoe pans, and mould the 
butter, too. 
They nail the horseshoe in the trunk to make the old 
clothes new, 
They hang 'em on the church door and for good luck to 
'em pray, 
And the preacher carries a 
horseshoe to keep the girls away 
The temperance man he carries it to protect him from the 
rum, 
And in hopes he may keep always drunk it's treasured by 
the bum, 
If you want to see a

Don't you commence your cussin', I

Yes, I'm a

Folks say we ain't no good 
But tramps has to live, I

should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and

That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose 
Down in the Lehigh 'Valley me and my people rew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, Cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest erecter the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux? Why, she had a 
dozen--had ' ern from near and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers— none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city strange:—young, handsome, and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
Tie :ffrlq the man for Nrellie—she didn't know no ; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story —common enough, you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her. 
to run away. 
More than a 
month or after we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to sink, 
Dead— in less than a 
fortnight— that's when I 
took to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes till the Judg-

Though seas now divide, and the mountains so wide,

sweet hour, 
When we watched the lads and lasses dancing gay, 
You've longed for my coming, and I've wept bitter 
tears, 
Your Scotch lassie still is your own; 
She never will be false, for her heart she left with you 
No! your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true.

Oh, laddie, my laddie far away, 
Still would your darling die for you; 
She never will be false, ah, no! no matter what they

That is waiting there, my own, for you and me;

half so fair, As that pretty little girl with the nut-brown hair. 
She'll sing and she'll dance to the old mill clack, 
And the song that she sings " Will my love come back," 
Till her old grandpa with his long white hair, 
Lauv.hs aloud till the tears down his cheeks run clear; 
And the lads in the village they know right well, 
What a 
charmer exists in that rustic dell. 
I 
love her all the better, its a 
fact what I 
say, 
She's as lively as a 
cricket all the livelong day.

Or a 
sweet water lily all among the rush. 
I 
sighed. " Pretty Polly. what a 
witch you are." 
And she said, get alon ,r. or I'll tell Grannpa." 
She's just like an angel that sweetly sings, 
I 
should really think she is, but she's got no wins.

At last one evening I 
did meet her, 
In a

And I 
with a

Ere she'd time to tell me not, 
And I 
quickly did discover 
That she was not now afraid, 
When I 
acted as a 
lover 
Soon great progreu., 
then I 
made. 
Married life she said she'd like it, 
And she'd gladly merry me: 
So a 
bargain we did strik.• it, 
And my wife she'll shortly he, 
And when arrives the happy day 
When I 
sqw,,,-,:e her she won't say—

Georgie now you frighten me; 
We'll spend our future days at Dover, 
But I 
won't give over or let her be.

Each warm kindred soil where the emblems are seen, 
May no fatal blunder, e'er tear them asunder,

Success to old Ireland, its hog and its mireland, 
There's not such a

For honor, for spirit, Fidelity, merit, 
For wit and good fellowship, frolic and fun. 
With wine and with whiskey when once he gets frisky, 
An Irishman's heart in true colors is seen ; 
While with mirth overflowiyg, with love it is glowing, 
With love for its own native Island of green.

There's a 
pretty little maiden, 
That I 
ever shall adore, 
In Italy that bright and sunny land; 
My life would be a 
pleasure, 
I 
would wish for nothing more, 
If she would only share my heart and hand; 
lier father is a 
brigand, 
On a 
lonely mountain pass, 
And with him on the mountain she does dwell; 
There is no titled lady, 
In all Europe can surpass, 
That dear Italian girl I 
love so well, 
CHOP.US: 
Though her father is a 
brigand on the mountain, 
She's as gentle as the dau,,,hter of an Earl; 
And although she set rne free, 
My heart will ever be, 
A captive to that dear Italian girl, 
While roaming lovely valleys, 
'_Neath the blue and sunny skies, 
A band of sturdy brigands bold and strong, 
Did capture me, and helpless, 
With a 
bandage o'er my eyes, 
A 
victim, I 
was, quickly led along, 
Five thousand pounds as ransom, 
They demanded I 
should pay, 
But that T 
was not rich enough to give, 
And only for the pleadings 
Of that little mountain maid, 
They would not have permitted me to live. 
(Chorus) 
They put me in a 
dungeon 
Where I 
thought that I 
should die, 
And while the brigand chief with all his band, 
Were plundering poor travelers, 
This lovely girl came nigh, 
in gloomy night and by my side did stand; 
She tore my bands asunder, 
Bade me rise and quickly fly, 
And from her fathers coffers gave me gold; 
And while the tears of love and pity, 
Glistened in her eye, 
The secrets of our hearts were plainly told, 
(Chorus). 
I 
bid her then to fly with me, 
And be my darling bride, 
Although her love for me was plainly shown, 
Her duty she declared, 
Was by her outlawed father's side, 
And so to America I 
returned alone; 
But I 
cannot live forever 
In this free and happy land, 
To Italy I'm going to return, 
To seek with love, and try to win, 
If only for awhile, 
That girl for whom my heart will ever yearn. 
(Chorus).

HEATHEN CHINAMAN.

As given by the HAvt.Es in the!r great sketch. 
We'll tell about a 
Chinaman, 
He was born in the town of Cilioes; 
His heal it was flat, jnst Eke a

He used to

He had freckles all

And warts all over his tongue,

He ,;•ot- the croup while eating soup,

He got sore eyes inoking at ules 
In a 
grocery around the corner. 
He had a 
face like a 
Texas steer, 
And eyes like a 
soft still crab: 
He had the glanders and yeflow janders, 
We thought he would go mad, 
This heathen Chinaman. 
His head it was big as a 
drum, 
He was tongue-tied in tiie let: 
He fell through a 
hall and lit on his gall, 
And landed away our in tile street. 
He had a 
big wart on his ear, 
A cancer on his back; 
While shoveling' fag he was bit by a 
hog, 
We packed him home in-ti sack, 
This heathen Chinaman. 
His mouth was twiAed from eating hot biscuit, 
He was anyti:ing but stow; 
You could hear hiln holer fourteen milts. 
And he never had tln- goot. 
When he walked the trect his back would squeak, 
He always had the blues; 
He was long and thin like a 
piece of tin, 
He was born in the town of

But her right name is Biddy :t

She comes home at night and from matinees 
With large baskets of floweis and little bouquets 
Oh she is our only daughter, 
And her father's the man that taught her. 
She wears spangled clothes, goes round on her 
The pride of the ballet is Biddy. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid, 
So I 
thought I'd go to the theatre, 
So I 
took the old lady along, 
And in the parquet I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance 
Our son Danny was up the tier, 
And he cried out ' Go in, sister Biddy," 
And they bounced him right out on his ear.

I'm George Augustus Clarence Noggs, 
For short they call me Gussy; 
My ma's a 
female Chinaman, 
So my linen's never mussy; 
My dress may be eccentric, 
But its quite au faire and right, 
The people stare and admire the air 
Of the little swell in white. 
CHORUS: 
I'm Gussy Noggs with my snow white toggs, 
Look so neat and trimmed and bright; 
The dandies ape the style and shape 
Of the little swell in white. 
I 
do not dress in English style, 
As our would-be dandies do: 
My style is the style of Gussy Noggs, 
And you'll all admit it's new; 
My high hat is always glussy, 
My white trousers are cut tight; 
There's none can imitate the style 
Of the little swell in white.

Dollar You Don't, 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
Does any one know what I'm going to say ? 
I'll be: you a 
dollar you don't. 
If I 
lose the wager, will any one pay, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Gay bachelors say they shall never take wives, 
For as each in his way to be happy contrives, 
They mean to keep single the rest of their liTes. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
Find an Irish election without any row, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't, 
Or a 
sin l 
who objects to a 
mistletoe bough, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some years of experience teaches me this— 
That from seven to ninety both Mrs. and Miss 
May refuse you this ancient excuse for a 
kiss. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
You may see vaccination a 
thing of the past, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
And heavy taxation abolished at last, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
You may see old John Bull dwindle down to a 
call, 
And his provender nothing but foreigners' chaff. 
You may see all the ladies too quiet by half, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some ignorant croakers wear visages long, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
And say that to visit amusement is wrong, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
Though to succor distress they can never afford, 
Above human vices they always have soared, 
Still somehow they know every move on the board, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
A 
married man often tries to prove cock- o'- the- walk, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar he don't. 
If he tries to sleep when his wife wants to talk, 
I 
shall bet him two dollars he don't. 
So all you young girls, please attend to this verse, 
And go and get married for better or worse, 
And two little armfuls you may have to nurse. 
Won't bet a 
dollar you don't.

LED ASTRAY. 
itecitation written by JOF. DONNELY and recited with tremeadou3 
success by him at the Park Theatre, Brooklyn. 
-- :0:— 
One pleasant morning for recreation, 
And in meditation for to spend the day, 
With a 
congregation of my own relations, 
I 
went meandering adown Broadway. 
Like ladies shopping, each bar we would stop in, 
For to take a 
drop in for to make us gay, 
When a 
policeman nabbed me, and as he grabbed me, 
He says, old man youv'e been led astray. 
With great vexation and botheration, 
Me to the station he then dragged along, 
With consternation and indignation, 
I 
was the sole attraction of all the throng, 
But I 
wasn't long getting to where the judge was sitting, 
And he looked over at me in a 
serious way, 
Yarn, says I 
don't mind me, but by gob he tined me, 
And says he old man, you have been led astray. 
Then with humiliation and botheration, 
To my habitation, I 
then took my way, 
And with great vexation as to what narration, 
Would drive the anger of ,ay wife away, 
I 
met her standing upon the landing, 
And the broom a 
handling in a 
threatning way, 
With a 
profound ovation upon dissipation, 
Says I, stop it darling, you have been led astray. 
Then I 
felt a 
pushing and I 
heard a 
rushing, 
And a 
great concussion like a 
heavy fall, 
Then madly stumbling and blindly tumbling, 
Bang! I 
went up against the wall. 
I 
looked all over for to discover, 
What tramp or loafer had been used that way, 
It soon was shown me, that down stairs she threw me, 
And I 
knew by gorra, I 
was led astray.

Our hair is turning grey, 
Louis Renouf tills us with life, 
And makes us young as May.

To the girl he's made his wife, 
The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
Then he's led a

Tim horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
For he's led a

MAHONEY'S FENIAN CAT. 
Written, composed and sung by GEO. W . 
CALLAHAN, the 
Ventriloquist. 
-: 
0 : 
On our back fence at twelve at night 
A big buck cat, striped black and white, 
Meanders out to look for fight— 
Mahoney's Fenian cat. 
With an eye gouged out and ears chimed off, 
With a 
half-mast tail and the whooping cough; 
Strange ratters thought they'd something soft 
On Mahoney's four-act cat. 
No cat or dog had pluck or gaul 
To give McGuire's pup a 
fall, 
So down he went to open the ball 
With Maloney's Thomas dog. 
Out from McGuire's alley gate 
He straightway did perambulate, 
Intending to make sausage meat 
Of Mahoney's brindle eat. 
They met upon McGuire's shed, 
With hair on end and eyehills red, 
With yells and howls twould raise the dead—. 
The slaughter it began. 
In half the time ye'd say beg-ob 
The air was full of McGuire's dog: 
While up and down McGuire's fence, 
The picture of pure innocence, 
Mahoney's cat sas-shayed. 
Then from the roof a 
brick was fired, 
I'd take me oath it was McGuire; 
It struck the cat between the eyes, 
knd down he went, but he didn't rise. 
There's a 
statue where this hero lies— 
Mahoney's Fenian eat.

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age, 
HLIMPTY DIIMPTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
ft is a .Fac simile of a Trick practiced by at. 
the _Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic orde.;) 
has been sent us, called ' Hurn DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear, 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated. suit; the next, only Columbin.e; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make any-body at,home in the hand-'
