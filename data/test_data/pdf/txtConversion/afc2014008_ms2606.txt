The Urban  Strain  project  has  now  suppl emented  the
 
Columbia  University  Horld  Survey  of  Exp ressive
 Style
 with
 
data  on  American  Pop.  In  the  earlier
 study
 we devel oped
 
cystemat
C  ways  of  describing  and  comparing  the structure
 
performance style , and
 of  deriving  reliable  informatio n 
aoout  culture  from fil ms  of  dances  and  tapes  of  music.
 
These  multi-parameter  systems  were  applied  to stratified
 
global  sampl e of  4000  songs  700  dance  -f
i
-rom  400  cultures.
 
Computer  operations  upon  this  data  produced
 world
 
taxonomies  of  performance  that  matched  and  illum4f
lat
c  the
 
ndings  of  a rcheology  and  antrropol ogY.  Moreover  a body  of
 
correlations  between  traits  of  performance
 and  traits  of
 
social  structure was  established,  sufficient  to explain  the
 
main  regional  and  areal  variations  of  styi
,  and  to show  the
 
cultural  significance  of  these  variations.

 of  expl oring  the  universes  of  the non-

Our  friendliest  critics,  however,  kept  reminding  us  that  we
 
had  never  applied  these techniques  to  a local  case,  to  a
 
singl e moment  in  history  --and  at  every  lecture  there was  at
 
least  one  person  who  inquired  ,
"
hat  about  jazz. -
 how  does
 
rock  fit  in  to your  world  picture?
 
Now,
 after  the  research  made  possibl e  by  the
 
Urban  Strain  Grant.  I no  longer  need  to  sidestep  these
 
issues-
 Analysis  of  a rich sampl e of  films  and  tapes,
 
documenting  the  entertainment  arts  of  the  20th  century,  has
 
brought  American  pop within  the frame of  our  gl obal
 
ethnography of  style.
 The study  is,  in  effect,  a first
 
ethnography of  pop  ,
 showing  its  roots  in  African  and
 
European  styl e and  anal yzing  the various  combinations  of
 
these two grand  traditions  that  emerged  from the furnace of
 
2oth  century urbanity  .
 The main  traits  and  the unique
 
history
 of  American  pop  song  styl e can  be  better  undertood
 
in  this
 world  perspective.
 
This
 research may
 prove  to  be of  more  than
 
scholarl y  importance.  The Urban  Strain  has  long  been  an
 
active  agent  in  the  homogenization  of  culture  -
 As  western
 
urban  industrialism
 spread  throughout  the world  ,the
 
favored  models  of  the American  entertainment  industry  have
 
been  generally  substituted  for  all  previous  systems  of
 
expressive communica ti on.

Break  Dance,  from  Spirituals  to  Swing,  European  forms  were
 
enlivened  by  black  style
 to  become national,  then
 
international  rhythmic  fare.  The  Times of  August  14th
 
proudly
 hails  Ellingon  as  in  many  ways  America's  most
 
original  musician
 He  heralded  his  basic  achievement  in
 
moulding  a large  ,
 literate  orchestra  that  could  dedpendably
 
perform written  arrangements  of  his  music
 What  particulary
 
impressed  the  reviewer  was  the mellow
 changefulness  of  the
 
music  --the  quick shifts  of
 mood,  color,  tempo,  dynamics
 
and  voicing
 carried  out  by  the  whol e orchestra  in  perfect
 
coordination.
 
These  are  precisel y  the  features  our  world  study
 
finds  are distinctive  for  Africa----  the ability of  groups  to
 
improvise  collectively  and  in  swinging  synchrony
 with
 
rhythm,  harmony,  melody,  vocal  col or  ,
 part  distribution,
 
tempo  *
 acent,  volume  ,
 etc..  We see the source of  this
 
skill  in
 African  dancing  ,
 where each  participant  can  vary
 
the  movement  *
 much  or  littl e,  and  yet  stay within  the
 
rhythmic  framework  -
 Co-accel eration  is  a constant
 
phenomenon  -
 One dancer  suddenly
 changes' direction,
 
level ,size.speed,  body  part  invol vement  and  others  move  in
 
the  same  instant
 in
 total  synch,  either  in  unison  or  wi t h
 
complementary  movement.
 
Such  moments,
 whion
 are  extremely  pleasureable
 
to  the  participants,  form a fundamental  part  of  black
 
S
 
I
 
socialization.  They  provide  the  basic  training  which
 
underlie the  black  proficiency  in  pol yrhythm  ,
in  improvizing
 
harmony,  in  changing  tone quality without  losing  tonal
 
blend,  in  co-accel eration.  They  are,  indeed,  the
 
generationally-transmitted
 non-verbal  skills  that  made  it
 
possible for  blacks  to  reinvent  Euro-American  music  wi
T
h
 
su c h  elan.  The  fact  that
 Euro-Americans  nave only  parziaily
 
perceived  and  mastered  this  African  non-verbal  system
 
explains  U why  Euro-Americans  still  cannot  play,  sing  or
 
dance  in  perfect  Afro-American  style,  and
 2)  why there
 
exist  so many
 widel y  popularized,  misconstrued  translations
 
of  the
 black  rhythmic  language.  The Urban  Strain  fil es
 are
 
repl ete with
 examples  of  such  mistranslations,  some
 
charming,  others  abominable.
 
Our  movement  search  finds  that  the  West  African
 
non-verbal  system  persisted  in  every  black enclave  in  the
 
New  World,  taking  a different  form  in  each cultural
 
context.Thus
 everywhere  the white Creole,  handling  his  body
 
as  one  unit,  encountered  the multi-unit  system  of  the  black
 
Creol e,  where movement  is  initiated  in  the central  body
 
and  where  the  pelvis,  belly,  chest  and  shoulders  may
 move
 
seperatel y and  to different  beats,  providing  a bodily  base
 
for  pol yrhythm  .
 Everywhere  the  Euro-American  was
 attracted
 
by  the  sensual  charm of  the  black style  and  tried  to  employ
 
it  with  varying  degrees  of  success,  but  always  without  the
 
means  to  see  how the  whole  system worked.
 
S
 
Europeans  check  eyes
—blacks  check  bodies  and  can
 
thus  anticipate movement  and  co-accelerate.  Multi-unit
 
middle  body movement  requires  a wide stance  and  a ground-
hugging  dance step  for  support.  The  prime trait  of  European
 
dance  is  an  airy  ,
 foot-crossing  step,  which demands
 
stillness  of  the middle  body,  Since the territorial
 goals
 
of  European  choreoghrophy can  best  be
 accomplished  with
 
this  step style,  it  is  seldom  really  given  up.  Thus  white
 
Americans  do  not
 achieve  a true  black dancing  styl e  ,
 no
 
matter  how they try,  because  are cut  off  from  and  lack
 
rehearsal  in  the
 mid-body skills  which  are  the  basis  of
 
black
 mell ow
 changefulness.  This  is  less  true of  the
 
Caribbean  and  South  America  than  the USA,
 for  the  rhythms
 
of
 Moorish  Andalucia  are  part  of  the  heritage of  many
 
Latin  Americans.
 Among
 North  Americans,  whose
 square,
 
linear,  restrained
 northern  movement  style  helped  them
 
colonize
 the  planet,  Creolization  has
 proceeded
 
reluctantly  a bit  at  a time.
 
At  the  end  of  the  process
 our  1980  codings  show  that
 
modern  white
 rockers  have  acquired  many  black traits  --high
 
energy,  changefulness  ,
 multi-unit,  wide  stance,
 
unconventional  tone,  overlap,  even  some  polyrhythm,  and  good
 
guitar  styl es  --but
 flowing  central  impulse and  ,above  all,
 
the  lifelong  rehearsal  in  co-acceleration,  which  helps  to
 
achieive  its  effects  gracefully,  are  still  missing.
 
S
 
Meanwhile  in  the  'BOs,  the
 blacks,  who came  in  with  the
 
ironic  blues,  have  become  the main  purveyors  of  romantic
 
ballads  ;  their  rockers  often  maintain  a steady scream  like
 
their  white  cc freres  ;  their  gospel  choirs  often  sing  in
 
unison  like a Broadway chorus;  and  Micheal  Jackson  rivals
 
Nuryev  with airey  foot-crossing  and
 narrative
 
onoreographies  that  match West  Side  Story. These  are
 
highlights  from the  picture of
 cultural  cross-over  the
 
Urban  Stna
n  cod
ngs  reveal.
 
I feel  sure  that  each Creol e  rhythmic  invention
 
heralded  some notabl e advance for  the  black  community,  some
 
break  in  the  caste  barrier  that  has  hemmed  them  in  in  ;  this
 
is  a matter  we are still  looking  into.
 Certainly white
 
acceptance  and  practice of  these new  styles  meant  satisfying
 
cultural
 recognition  and,  at  least,  promised  opportunity  to
 
black  performers
 This  goes  far  to
 explain  the  joyousness
 
that  infuses  so much of  the
 music  that  has  come  from  the
 
American
 black
 ghetto, --it  was  the feeling  of  moving on
  
U n.
 Many notes  of  triumph  resound  even  in  the  not  wholly
 
melanchol y  blues,  for  whil e  the  blues  singers
 were
 
commenting  on
 sexual
 alienation  and  racial  injustice,  the
 
daily  wage  of  their  listeners  was  increasing
 from
 $15
 
dollars  a month
 to  $15
 a week
 to  $15
 a day  and  on
 
up
 
0
 
Yet  there were  painful  ironies.  First  of  all  ,
 the
 
S
 
urban
 Euro-American  musical
 
system was  literate  ,
 was
 
taught  in  schools  and  had  an
 aristocratic
 background
 
whereas  the  black tradition  was  unwritten,  orally
 
transmitted  and  came from  the  plantation  and  the  back
 
streets.  Thus,  in  spite  of  world  wide  successes  ,
 many  black
 
muscians  erroneously
 saw  themselves
 as  '
 ignorant'
 
proponents  of  a
 lowly  tradition  that  needed  "improving."
 
To  wipe  out  this  feeling
 many  acquired  a Euro-American
 
musical  education  and  joined  their  white colleagues  in'
 
reforming"  or
 taking  the  blackness  out  of  Afro-American
 
music.  We  code  the  big  orchestras  of  "educated"
 black
 
musicians,  often  tied  down  to scores  ,way over  in  the white
 
column--not  phrasing  with  their  bodies,no  longer  multi-unit,
 
losing  changefuliness  and  warmth of  tone  and
 tied  to
 
unison.  Meantime out  of  the uneducated  ghettos,  where
 
rhythms  still  had  a base  in  multi-unit  movement,  came
 
fabulous  new  things  like  boogie-woogie,  rock,  break  dancing,
 
etc.
 
Another
 source  of  irony.
 Until  very  lately
 
the  American
 theatre was  Jim  Crow,  so  that
 Afro-American
 
rhythmic  creations  normally  reached  a wide  audience only via
 
write artists  -
 Their  presentations
 were stylistically
 
naive  and  often  intentionall y caricatured  ,
 as  in  the
 
blackface  minstrel  show.  Al  Jolson's  rendition  of  Mar
nr
nv  is  a
 
horrifying  example of  this  epoch.  Yet  in
 order  to work
 
professionally,  blacks  had  to adopt  this  deformed  style.
 
Many
 of
 the  greats  of  the  Harl em  rennaisance
 
performed  in  blackface  and  sang  "coon'  songs,  with  the  full
 
backing  of  their  community.  First  of  all,  their  fell ows  saw
 
that
 they  were  opening  a  pathway  that  led  to Hollywood  and
 
world  fame; --a  path  down  which sauntered  Bill  Robinsor
,,
 
Eubie  Blake,  Fats  Wall er  and  a host  of  others.
 Second,  they
 
were  presenting  Afro-American  artistry  to  a delighted
 
public.  Our  codings  show  that
 beneath  the mask  of  burnt
 
cork  and  lip  rouge there was  true  blackness.  The
 film
 
record  reveals  that  the
 performances
 of  these  black
 
blackface  minstrels  incorporate
 key components
 of  African
 
style: --  the  ground  hugging  step,  multi-unit  trunk,constant
 
chnge
 of  pace,  syncopation  ,and  above  all  a playful,
 
unconventional  use  of  quality  in  speech  and  song.  dance,  and
 
instrumentation.
 
At  the  beginning  of  this  century  these  black  ex-
minstrels  were  an  intruding  minority  in  a  orld  dominated  by
 
:rish  tenors  and  conventional  pit  orchestras.
 Our
 
codings  of  the  early cylinder  recordings  depict  this
 
situation.  The
 admired  romantic
 singers
 maintained  a
 
singl e vocal  persona  --a  noise-free  ,ringing,  crisply
 
enunciated  quality  -
-
-
 through all  registers  and  levels  of
 
volume,  using  tremol o,nitard  and  loudness  for  emphasis,  with
 
trailing  accompaniment  and  interludes  played  by an  orchestra
 
of  strings  and  winds.  The comic  singers  used  the  blackface
 
manerisms  ,
-
 -
-
 smearing  notes,  slurring  text,  their  vocal
 
delivey  intermittently  harsh,  nasal,  sour,  growling,  piping
 
and  often  conversational.
 Their  banjo-accompanied
 songs
 
were  peppered  with syncopated  stacatto  phrases  and  set
 to  a
 
dancing  beat.
 This  catchy naturalistic  vocalizing  was
 
adopted  by
 the  earliest  pop singers  ,men  like George M.
 
Cohan,  Eddie  Cantor  and  Al  Jolson  ,
 who  enhanced  the  tenory
 
projection  expected  of  the vaudevill e  lead  ,
 with the  tricks
 
of  minstrelsy  and  with a hard  speech-like quality,  that  made
 
unashamed  use of  nasality ---a  Jewish version  of  blackface.
 
But  there was  always  the  lapsing  into speechlike tone to
 
bring  the  point  home and  bring  down  the  house  with  laughter.
 
Meantime  a true musical  revolution  had  taken  place
 
in  New  Orleans  ,
 though  it  wasn't  to  be waxed  until  the  20s.
 
The  French-speaking  Creoles,  ghettoized  in  Reconstruction,
 
maintained  their  public  presence  in  the strteet  marches  of
 
their  brass  bands.  Interacting  with the dancing  crowds  that
 
accompanied  them,  ,
 these orchestras  played  polyrhythmically
 
and  improvized  collectively.  They  revoiced  the  European  wind
 
instruments,  literally vocalizing  through them  ,giving  them
 
an  unprecedented  expresive  range so that  they could  sing,
 
shout,  scream,  moan,  power,  laugh.  This  was  the  heritage of
 
African  tone  langauge,  the talking  drum  and  the  black string
 
player  who demands  that  his  instrument  speaks  the words  of
 
S
 
the  song.
 Moreover
 in  New Orleans  the  players  shared  a
 
common  vocabulary of  street  dance tunes,  enriched  by  the
 
blues  that  came  from the  riverfront,  and,  best  of  all,  there
 
was
 plenty of  work,  so that  this  radical  new Creole  style,
 
which was  Afr -icanizing  European  orchestration,
 had  time  to
 
ripen.
 Alexander's  Ragtime  Band  heralded  the arrival  of
 
this  new music  in  megalopolis  before  hcrld  Nar  I
,  and  then
 
during  the war  the amazing  Jim  Europe  introduced  it  in
 
Europe.  The  best  fine arte composers  of  that  age--Sravinsky
 
among  others  -
-
 listened  in  awe
 to something  totally
 
impossible  --collective  -Tmprovization  of  melody,  rhythm and
 
harmony
- awe.
 
For  a long  time  and  at  an  increasing  pace,  a
 
touch of  this  jazzy  syndrome could  foster  the  popularity of
 
any  performance  ,
 The great  Jell y  Roll  Morton  pointed  out
 
that  he could  make  jazz  of  anything,  even  of  "high class
 
opera,  like the Miserere of  Ii  Travadore."
 So,  over  the
 
years.  American  pop
 has  put  one  of  its  stylistic  stamp on
 
everything  from  Peruvian  flute  music  to Beethoven  and
 
Indian  raga.  The American  musical  expl ore d  the world
 
producing  a baedeker  of  solid  hit  in
 jazzed-up
 treatments
 
of  Middle  European  operetta  .The main  actors  in  this  part  of
 
the  story were  not  Creole. They came  of  New York's  East  Side,
 
but  in  origin  they  were  Jews  from  Eastern  Europe.

S
 
This  was  the group that made the  principal
 
European  contribution  to the union  between the  Eurpean  and
 
African  song  traditions.  Not  only did  they write and  arrange
 
a huge percentage of the early  hits  and  hit shows  of
 
S
 
American
 
pop
 
profited from
 
but they  built,  manned,  directed  and  hugely
 
the vast  industry that  grew up to develop
 
this  internationally appealing  product.  Their  background  had
 
equipped  them for  their cosmopolitan  role and given them an
 
eclectic  viewpoint.  Having  suffered  for  racial  persecution,
 
having  experienced  the sorrows  of  exile and  poverty,  they
 
had  little race  predjudice and  ccould sympathize with the
 
oppressed  blacks.  Coming  from the heart of  the Slavic  world,
 
they were well  acquainted  with singing  that  our codes show
 
is  very close to  black style.  Their own  religious
 semi-
oriental  songs,especially from
 the Chassidim,  prepared  them
 
for  the  laments  of  the slaves  and the  blues.
 
They were also of  a mercantile and  cosmopolitan
 
bent.  They felt no comopunctions  about touching up the
 
Foster  tradition  ,
 with  ragtime and  with cadences  from their
 
own  semi-oriental  background,  and their  show tunes  evolved
 
from simple strophes  to  brooding  through composed  melodies.
 
They parlayed World War  I into a string  of  hit  tunes,  wrote
 
lyrics  in  barbarous  black dialect,  cleaned  up and
 
sentimentalized the blues
 and  ,
 turned  plantation  tunes
 
into  piano concertos.  At
 the same time they genuinely  loved
 
and  admired  black musicians,and,  for  a percentage of  the
 
O
 
profits  ,gave them all  the  chances  the Jim Crow  rules  of  the
 
time  permitted.  The  blacks  in  their  turn  felt  a kinship for
 
the  somewhat  syncopated  and  bluesy
 Russian-Jewish  ballads
 
of  Tin  Pan  Alley
 and  recorded  them  with  such  panache that
 
they
 sounded  like  great  music.  They
 also  gave  tips  about
 
playing  to the eager  Jewish  kids  who  hung  arout  in  haick
 
dancehalls--kids  like  Bennie  Goodman.
 
All  the  ethnicities,  all  the
 regional  cultures
 
joined  in---  Creole,  Southern,  Western  ,Middl ewestern,
 
Irish,  German, Latin,  Italian.  Our  codings  show
 Frank
 
Sinatra  shaping  his  rhythms  like  his  Neopolitan  forebears
 
and  at  the same using  the  gesture style of  the  Inkspots.
 
They  show
 French-speaking  black  Creoles  transforming  the
 
Central  European  brass  band,  good  for  unison  marching  and
 
waltzing,  into a Caribbean  ensembl e for  red-hot  African
 
street  dancing,  where singing  winds  improvise coll ectively
 
in  polyrhythm with the drums  in  African  fashion.  When  this
 
New  Orl eans  jazz  moved  North,the codings  show,  Middlewestern
 
musicians,  trained  by German  music- masters,  Europeanized  it
 
into a big  orchestral  style,played  from scores,  where unison
 
sections  of  winds  swung  against  the each other.  In  this  big
 
band  period  the  majority of  jazzmen  came from  places  like
 
Milwaukee.
 
In  the  epoch  of  World  War  II  the
 Southern  small
 
combos  that  played  the  blues, hill billy,  rhythm and  blues,
 
S
 
and  rockabill y ushered  in  the  era  of  rock.  Rock  ,
 still
 
shows  its  Southern  and  Southwestern  roots,  but  the  rock
 
ensemble  is  a modern  representative of  a type  long  popular
 
in  the  urban  Middle  East
 and  the African  kingdoms, --  a
 
flexibl e  but  modest  combination,  in  which  an  impassioned
 
bard  is
 accompanied  by  improvising  strings  and  percussion..
 
This  small  flexible  combo,  in  the  hands  of  ambitious  youth,
 
soon  satisfied  the appetite of  urbanity
 for  ostantatious
 
displays  of  power  and
 organizational  compl exity  in  musical
 
performances  -
 Rock
 acquired  gigantic  loudspeakers  that
 
produce  the  loudest  music  ever  heard.  Its  webs  of
 
synthesizers  and  multi-track amplifiers  afford  an  undreamed-
of  level  of  complexity,  by means  of  which whole  range of
 
sound-making  may  be  incorported  into  an  arrangenment.
 
Its  highl y choreographed  productions
 often
 
require  an  army of  stage  hands,  dancers,  technicians
 and
 a
 
fleet  of  trucks.  In  spite of  its  laidback,  orgiastic
 
charoteristics  ,the  rock concert  projects  the  image of  the
 
new  el ectronic  civilization  with  infinite  power  under
 
fingertip control
.
 Rock  replaces  the .
image' of  regimented
 
corporate  organization  presented  by the  big  orchestras  with
 
that  of  a  small  informally dressed  and  organized  male
 
coterie,  capable of  quick  action  and  collective
 
immprovization,--  -the size group that  operates  in  street
 
crime,  performs  corporate  raids  or  initiates  new  companies
 
in  silicon  valley.
 To the delight  of  its  largel y  feminine
 
n
 
Th e ir
 
audience,  however, these  rich and highly eligible young
 
males,  dressed in rags that show off  their  muscles and bel�e
 
the size of  their bank accounts , sing  almost exclusively
 
about mating and manipulate their  guitars in a selfconscious
 
way as sex symbols,  their  bilateral  African  playing style
 
making  the strings
 squeal  in repeated orgasnms.
 
S
 
Time cnstraints  restrict  limit  this  report  to one
 
S
 
aspect  of  the  interpretive  framework  the Urban  Strain
 
Project  has  devel oped----our  ethnographicl y oriented  view  of
 
American  pop,  as  a mingling  of  European  and  African
 
expressive traditions.  The social  factors,  governing  this
 
process  were  treated  in  a prior  report  and  may only  be
 
mentioned  here.  The  most  important  of  these
 are  the  changes
 
in  the  family,  in  the community and  in  race  relations
 
wrought  by  20th century  industrial  society.  These  profound
 
alterations  in  social  structure  brought  shifts  in  the
 
audience and  its  its
 emotional  and  social  needs.  The new
 
songs,  in  order  to succeed  ,
 had  to dramatize  these  changes
 
and  voice  these needs.  The song  performance  ,
 often  in  an
 
veil ed  way,
 exposed  the structures  of  these  highly charged
 
social  dramas  in  which all  were  involved  .
 The  hit  singers
 
personified  main  rol es  in  the coll ective fantasies
 
concerning
 sexual  fulfill ment  and  personal  success.
 
For  example  the  pop  music  industry  dethroned  the
 
conventional  singer  and  populated  the vocal  landscspe with
 
performers  who sang  like they tal ked,  in  a' wide  range of
 
vocal  styles  that  matched  the variety of  America's  ethnic
 
and  regional  cultures.  The age of  the common  man  in  song  was
 
ushered  in  by unconventional  vocalizing  like
 the nasal
 
twang  of  Jimmie  Rogers.  the  hard  salesmans  delivery of  Eddie
 
Cantor,  the  husky  coal-heaving  rap of  Louis  Armstrong,  and
 
the  placatory crooning  of  Bing  Crosby.  To  make an  impression
 
S
 
a pop singer  needed,  not  a well  trained  '
good'  voice,  but
 
that  symbolized  a social  group emerging  into  prominence,  as
 
Sinatra's  voice  refected  his  Italian  background.
 
Blacks,  women,  young  peopl e  gained  a new
 
independence  as  they  came  into the  industrial  job market,  at
 
the  same time facing  the  insecurity and  the
 alienation
 he
 
new  hardboil ed
 urban  culture  .
 The  loss  of  community  ties,
 
the  loosening  of  family structure and  the  liberalization
 of
 
sexual  standards,
 particularly  as  it  affects  courtship  and
 
marriage  have  been  refl ected  in  and  been  profoundly
 
influenced  by the American  pop  tradition.  Rock  provided  a
 
culure of  sorts  to generations  of  urban  youth who  had  been
 
largely deprived  of  parenting  by  the  demands  of
 the  labor
 
market
Everywhere the  presence of  a vigorous  Afro-American
 
cultural  tradition,  emerging  from  the  shadows,  affects  these
 
issue  .
 These  social  forces  ,
 briefl y  mentioned  here,  have
 
been  important  in
 shaping
 the Urban  Strain.
 
THE  SIZE AND  COMPOSITION  OF
TE  DATA BASE
 
1)  Anal yses  of  Sound  Recordings
 
I
 
More than  400  sound
 recordings  have  been
 
analysed  to create the Urban  Strain  sampl e,  which  is  as
 
large  as  that  of  any  region  in  our  global  set.  Much of  the
 
coding  was  done
 in  collaboration  with
 Roswell  Rudd,
 
formerly staff  musicologist.  We used  the expanded  form of
 
Cantometric  system
 created
 specially
 for  the American
 
pop  field.  The material  covered  falls  into
 the  following
 
categories:
 1)  American  pop  song,  jazz  and
 
rcck, proportiof
led  by  decade from  1900  to  the  present
 with
 
about  an  eaual  number  performed  by  black and  white artists;
 
2)  Country  music  including  old-timeY,  blue  grass  and  modern
 
country songs--with a background  set  of  every type of
 
American  rural  folk song  3)  American  musicals  of  stage  and
 
screen  ;4)  Gospel  --with a background  set  of  every  type of
 
Afro-American  ritual  fo1ksong;  5)  The  Blues--at  every  level
 
of  commercialization  and  with a background  set  of  country
 
b1ues, hol1erS  and  work  songs.
 
These  records  (and  many others  not  anal yzed  but
 
surveyed)  are assembled  on  a set  of  sound  tapes,indexed
 for
 
review  and  further  study.
 The collection  was  brought
 
together  from many sources,  and  is  unique  in  providing  a
 
summative overview of  most  of  the main  trends  of  the  last  80
 
years  .
 
We sampled  big  hits  and  the top selling  performers
 
of  every decade
 
using  standard  listings  ,
 such as  T
h e
 
Bill board  Book  of  To2 40  Hits,  ,
 Murrell's  Million  Sellina
 
Records, etc.  as  our  guides. A few other  pieces  that  stand
 
for  the  special  tendencies  in  each  period  were also
 
analyzed.
 Until  quite  recently  ,discimination  kept  the
 
majority  of  black  artists  out  of  the top of  the  hit  parade,
 
S
 
even  though their  performances  were greatly
 admired  and
 
much  imitated.  In  order  to correct
 for  this  bias,  we chose
 
an  equal  number  of  top  black  and  white  records  from each
 
period.
 
This
 hit  parade sampling
 fits  our  gl obal
 
ethnographic  approach  .
 On  the one  hand  it  provides  an
 
overview of  the  performance styl es  that  the majority of
 
people  actually  heard.
 On  the other  ,
 it  affords  a dramatic
 
picture of  the  interchange  between  the  black and  while
 
musical  traditions  as  they  gradually merged.  Each decade's
 
codings  note the  adoption  of  white  patterns
 by  blacks  and
 
vice versa  ,
 and  then  the  imitations  of  mixed  styl es  by  both
 
sides,  as  every artist  and  group  strives
 to  reach  and  hold
 
a wide  audience.
 
To  my astonishment  this  hit  parade
 approach
 
reveal ed  cl earcut  patterns
 each one of  which
 shaped  a
 
whol e string  of  performances  in  its  decade.  In  fact,I
 
believe  it  would  not  be difficult  ,
 with a bit  more work,
 
to  make  predictions  about  the  performance
 tructures  most
 
likely to  sell  records  at  any given  juncture.  By  providing  a
 
bird's  eye  view of  this  dramatic  process  ,the collection,
 
itself,
 has  considerable value.  Plans  are devel oping  to
 
transfer  these  recorded
 data  in  digital  form to a CDI  and
 
develop  a retrieval  system  based  on  the  CantometriC  patterns
 
discovred  in  it,  creating  a sort  of  mini-museum of  American
 
pop song.
 
The  roster  of  the  performers  studied  reads  like
 
a history of  popular  culture.In  the early
 teens,  for
 
example,  we  coded  John  MacCormick,  Enrico Caruso,  George
 
Cohen,  Jelly  Roll  Morton,  Al  Jolson,  Bert  Hilliams,  Jim
 
Europe,  Eddie Cantor,  Nobl e Sissi e.  For  the  '20s  Paul
 
Whiteman,  Ted  Lewis,  Bix Biederbeke, Gene Austin,  Sophie
 
Tucker, Fl etcher  Henderson,  Louis  Armstrong,  King  Oliver,
 
Benny Moten,  and  Bessie Smith.  In  the  '30s  we coded
 
Armstrong  and  Ellington  continued  along  with
 Ethel  Waters,
 
Cab  Calloway,  Andy  Kirk,  Count  Basie,  Billie Holiday,and
 
their  white  foll owers  Rudy Valee,  Russ  Columbo,  Henry  James,
 
the  Dorseys,  Bing  Crosby,  Artie Shaw,  the  Dorseys,  Bing
 
Crosby,  Artie Shaw,  the  list  goes  on  through the  rhythm and
 
blues  and  rock  stars.  Onl y  in  the  1980s  do  blacks,  like
 
Jackson  and  Prince,  have  the sales  importance  of  a Crosby
 
and  Sinatra.

Video.
 
orrestine  Paulay and  Mary  Lobell
 ,
 the
 
project's
 movement  specialist,  collaborated  on  more  than
 
150  Choreometric  analyses,  including:  1)  Square dances,  both
 
traditional  and  modern  precision  clogging --- with  a
 
background  of  country  dancing  from Great  Britain,  Holland,
 
and  Scandanavia.
 2)  Buck and  wing  and  tap dancing
 
by white  and  black  performers  ,
 rural  and  urban,  on  stage
 
and  in  fil ms  --with a background  of  European  dancing.  3)
 
Ballroom dancing,from  the waltz  and  the  cakewalk,  through
 
the  charleston  and  the  lindy,  to the  slow  drag  and  the
 
boogaloc  ,by  professionals  and  amateurs,  black  and  white.

4)  Vaudeville dancing,  including  strip  tease,
 
contortion,  fan  ,novelty,  chorus  line,  acrobatic  and  Apache.
 
5)  Every type of  American  black dance,  inncluding  ring

Caribbean  and  4est  Africa.6)  A sample of  American  fine  art

singing  stars  and  most  important  combos  ,
 from Al  Jolson
 
to  Micheal  Jackson,  from Uncl e  Dave Macon  and  his  Boys  to
 
The  Talking  Heads.
 
This  coll ection  is  a preliminary attempt  to survey
 
the  available  documents  on
 American  expresive
 movement
 
style  -
 It  is  smaller  and  less  sharply focussed  than  the
 
song  sample,
 for  we had  no
 dance hit
 parade and  little
 
scholarship to guide us.
 Whereas  the
 exhaustive
 
discographies
 of  the
 record  industry provide,  in spite of
 
many  biases,  an  almost month-by--month picture of  the growth
 
of  American  pop  ,
 the
 visual  coverage of dance,  until  the
 
advent  of TV,
 has  been  very spotty.  The great  collectors
 
like  Ernie Smith and  Mura  Dehn,  were generous.  We found  a
 
rich  lode of  documents  in  the Hollywood and  TV compilations
 
of  hits  and  famous  performers
 and  in  the full  dress
 
musicals  that  Hollywood  once produced
 Here Busby Berkeley,
 
Fred  Astairs,  Bill  Robinson  and  had  left their  brilliant
 
mark
 But  there were unhappy gaps.
 
It  was  hard  to find  visual  documents  of ordinary
 
people  performing the
 ballroom dancing that matched  the hit
 
parade.
 We discovered no
 great sequences  of the wonderful
 
biackface minstrel  daners  who opened the century,  filmed  in
 
context.  We can only guess at  the style of the great  Isadora
 
Duncan,  because she consistently refused  to  let  herself  be
 
filmed.  Nontheless  ,
 we found a treasure of wonderful
 
material
 and  again  put  together  a compilation
 
that  affords a fresh
 perspective on
 American dance.  Very
 
many of  the scenes are available on  current commercial  video
 
tapes  or  through  PBS  .
 This means  that  the researchers
 who
 
want  to study our  findings  in  detail  and  learn  how to apply
 
the coding  system  ,
 can
 have
 easy access  to the visual
 as
 
well  as  to  the  recorded  data
 that  lies  back  of  the  URBAN
 
STRAIN
 analyses
 
Study of  the  collection  and  its  codings  reveal  the
 
continuing  authority of  the movement  styl e of  Northwest
 
Europe(up  to now the dominant  cultural  tradition  in  the
 
USA
 In  this  tradition  dancing  tends  to  be  linear,  stiff-
bodied  and  whol e-limbed  ,moderately dynamic,  performed  by
 
virtuosic  soloists  ,
 mixed  couples  or  highly  regimented
 
groups
 
-
 moving  in
 
unison  and  with  fancy,  foot-crossing
 
footwork which can  precisel y carry them through elabrate
 
serial  choreographies  that  define  large territories.
 
The  square dance,  the jig,  the step  dance,  the
 
chorus  line,  the  acrobatic  dance, ball et  ,modern,  even
 
children's  games  partake of
 this  model.
 Its  sculptural  use
 
of  body and  gesture,  its  highl y  regimented  unison  and  its
 
precise use of  space give  it  high visibility  from a
 
distance.
 These qualities,  combined  with  its  emphasis  on
 
long  serial  choreograophies  that  define wide  territories,
 
make  this  style  ideal  for  dramatic  theatri
al  use.
 Fine art
 
dance,  the darling  of  an  elite audience and  performed
 
largely  by women,  conforms  most  strictly  to  this  North
 
European  pattern  .
 In  spite of  the use  by Graham and  others
 
of  certain  African  gestures,  stillness  and  posing  dominate
 
much  of  fine art  choreography.
 
S
 
It  is  in  the social  dance and  its  theatrical
 
offshoots  that  our  coding  discovers  the strongest  influence
 
of  black  styl e  .
 Here arose the American  dance styles
 that
 
took  the fancy of  the world.  Black slaves  transformed  the
 
North
 European  solo step dance  into the  syncopated  buck
 
dance,  with  its  surprising  change of  pace.  its  bent  posture,
 
its  occaasional  foot  sliding  .This  style with  its  basket  of
 
tricky  ,
 story-telling  steps
 dominated  the  minstrel  show
 
pioneered  the west, became the modern  Appalchian  flatfoot,
 
and  sired  the  blackface
 cake  wal k.  Our  codings  show  how
 
Bill  Robinson,  Buck and  Bubbles,  the Nicholas  Brothers
 
endowed  it  with  even  subtl er  syncopations,  with  pol yrhythm
 
and  with accrobatic  wings.  It  dominated  vaudeville,  the
 
musical  and  ,
 with Astaire and  Kelly  ,
 expanded  into
 
feature dramatic  films.  Our  codings  watch these great  white
 
hoofers  cover  territory and  tell  charming  stories  with  their
 
fun-filled  feet.
 When  a b1ack  team dances  one  of  the
 
temporary  interludes  the culture allowed  them  ,
 we again
 
record  dynamic  qualities  that  seem  to set  fire to the stage.
 
Then  we  return  again  to
 the  longer,  moderately energetic,
 
narrative
 choreographies  of  Astaire and  Rbgers  .
 Inevitably
 
they
 climax  in  scenes  of  ever
 more extravagant  and  more
 
acorobatic  fun.
 
In  the  blues  joints  of  the Mississppi  Valley  the
 
blacks  transformed  the waltz  position  into  a dance of  open
 
sexuality,  called  the  sl ow  drag.  Hardly moving  from their
 
S
 
place,plastered  together  belly  to  belly,  the dancers  slowly
 
ground  their
 hips  together  to  the  beat  of  the  blues  in  a
 
prol onged  vertical  mime of  sexual  intercourse  .
 The sl ow
 
drag  has  given  rise to three generations  of  sexy couple
 
dances,  born  in  the  black ghetto  and  taken  up  by  the whole
 
world.  Some are fragments  of  traditional  African  dance
 
style,  and  all,  in  one way or  another,  adapt  the  European
 
mixed  couple  to  the African  stylstic  model  discussed  above.
 
At  first  the  new dances
 came from  the
 
Mississippi  Valley,  but  for  at  least  50  years  they  have  been
 
invented  annonymously
 in  the  black dance  halls  of
 
Megalopolis...  The  genius  of  the  Charleston  was  to combine
 
European  footcrossing  and  high  kicking  with African  lateral
 
foot  articulation  and  opened  crotch  .
 .
 .
 The genius  of  the
 
Lindy was  to  outdo  ballet  partnering  until  the  lady
 was
 
literally  airborne,  spinning  away  and  back,  mounting  her
 
partner  ,
 diving  through  his  legs  ,streaming  up  his  back  and
 
flying  through the air  over  his  head.  Its  scores  for  speed,
 
energy  ,
 co-acceleration  and  changefulness  are among  the
 
highest  in  the  world.
 
In  break  dancing  the  youth  of  the ghetto created
 
S
 
their  own  balletic  form.  Its  basis  was  turn-taking,  the most
 
distinctive  characteristic  of  African  gatherer  dance.  Its
 
climax was  the  black  inversion  of  the climactic  moment  in
 
classical  ballet,  where  the  heroine spins  en  pointe  on  her
 
S
 
toe  in  romantic  costacy.  The emotional  climax  in  African
 
dance takes  place  at  ground  level  close  to  holy mother
 
earth.  There -Fore,  the climax of  the  breakdance  is  earth-
bound.As  the finale of  a series  of  remarkable acobatic
 
moves,  the  black  break dancer  finally  turns  upside  down  and
 
spins  en  pointe  on  his  head  on  the  harsh  urban  pavement
 
which  is  his  urban  stage.
 
These  are  perhaps  the  most  remarkable  of  the dances
 
that  the fol k of  the  black ghetto  have  produced  in  the  last
 
half  century.  Now  there
 are  inimations  that  this  wellspring
 
of  dance  is  drying  up  ,
 stiffl ed  by the choreographic
 
plethora  pouring  out  of  MTV.  The  recent  rise of  Double
 
Dutching,--  the feminine answer  to  break dancing-- and  Rap,-
-
 the coll ectively  improvised  dance of  words,a  most  ancient
 
African  art  ---may  belie this.  One  thing  is  certain.
 
The  greedy speed-up  of  production  by  the amusement  industry
 
is  surrounding  us  with  a rather  graceless  soundscape.
 
THE  HRITEUP
 
Considerable  portions  of  the  interpretive  findings
 
of  the Urban  Strain  project  have  been  set  down  in  the
 
vari ous
 reports  on  the  project,including  this  one.  The
 
thinking,  the writing  in  these documents  will
 contribute
 
to  later  publications.  Meantime we  have  found  a  useful
 
new  way to  report  on  projects  such  as  this  one.  Previously
 
we  had  worked  with  computer  evaluations  of  assemblies  of
 
the multi-l evel,  multi-page  Canto and  Choreo  pro -Fil es  ,
 and
 
these  had  been  rewarding  on  a grand  cross-cultural
 
scale.However,  for  the evaluation  of  one tradition  we needed
 
tools
 of  smaller  scale.  Each one of  our  codings  is  a
 
detailed  portrait  of  an  act  of  expressive communication  at  a
 
particular  time.
 A series  of  them can  capture  the  feel  of
 
an  epoch.  But
 how can  one use  such numerical  anal yses  to
 
illumine  a small -scale  trend?
 
4
hen  Ms.  Paulay  and  I worked  together  on  the dance
 
codings  of  URBAN  STRAIN  ,
 we often  split  up  the  long
 
Choreometnic  proceedure  ,
 checking  back and  forth as  we
 
moved  through  it.  Then,  with  the dance
 still  on  the viewer
 
,we taped  a
 review of  the codings,  summarizing  the  patterns
 
perceived,  comparing  them  to others  out  of  the corpus,  and
 
characterizing  the  styl e as  a whol e.  in  this  way  we made  our
 
summative survey of  "modern"  American
 dance,  taping  as  we
 
talked,  commenting  on  the  stylistic  contribution  of  each
 
choreographer.  Overall, our
 codings  indicate
 that  this  fine
 
art  tradition  was  -Far  less
 receptive  to
 the  imprint  of
 
black  style
 than  the entertainment  or  social  dance
 and
 
that  -
Full  scale  merging  is  rare  in  this  field.
 Even  in  the
 
Twyla  Tharpe jazz  dance  ball ets,  black is  in  quotes and  is
 
main
y
 portrayed  as  a way to  have  fun  and  relax  -   
A bit  later  on,  we
 co-coded  many scenes--she
 
the movement,  I the music-- and  then  dictated  our summary
 
imopression of  how the music  and movement fitted  together
 
Here the  breakthroughs came thick and fast.  As we studied
 
the big  singing stars,  we  realized that codable diffferences
 
in  body style were responsible for  audible differences  in
 
rhythmic  approach and  tonal  projection
 .
 The startling
 
musical  contrast  between
 
James  Brown  and  Mick Jagger on  the
 
same stage could  be accounted  by their
 vastly
 different
 
ways  of using  energy,
 with Jagger
 notably slow and non-
dynamic
 by comparison!!  .
.
 Study of  Pressley's  performances
 
showed  that  he,  more than  other white singers
 of that
 
period  ,
 handled  his  body  ,
 his  energy,  as well  as  his voice
 
in  a rather  black way  .The details  of  all  such matters
 went
 
straight  into a tape  recorder  ,
 while  both the codings and
 
our  interpretations were still  hot.
 
These oral  reviews  helped us overcome the
 
timidity the analytic  process  induces  , e moved
 straight
 
into talk that  summed
 up the
 analysis,
 got  down valuable
 
first  impressions  and
 stated the all- imp ortant  obvious.
 
This  approach requires that  researchers
 to synthesize and
 
to say what  they
 think the
 data  means.  Considering  the
 
investment  of  time and  skill,the  results are a plus--
mistakes  can  be corrected  later  in  amother  look at  the
 
coding  and  the same stretch of  film.
 
Transcript -ions  of  these oral  reviews  made  such
 
good  reading,  that  this  year  I returned  to  the  data  and
 
taped
 my comments  on  several  hundred
 codings  as  I listened
 
to  the songs  again.  It  was  an  amazing  experience.  I  felt
 
was  getting  at  an  overview of  the growth of  jazz.
 During
 
the  same  period,stimulated  by  the formidable  literature on
 
jazz  and  rock  ,  I dictated  notes  on  a variety  of
 
questions-All  this  ran  to several  hundred  pages  and
 
ammounted  to a somewhat  informal,  but  focussed  account  of
 
the  ripening  of  the  American  rhythmic  arts,
 with stylistic
 
characterizations  of  many of  its  stars  and  hit  performances.
 
A book  on
 The  Urban  Strain  was  taking  shape  in  the  pc.
 
The  body  of  the  book  ,
 as  I envision  it,  will
 
consist  of  our  reviews  of  a several  hundred  performances
 
arranged  in
 chronologiocal  order-- a  stylistic
 ramble
 
through  the  vast  thickets  of  jazz.
 Since much of  the
 
general
 interpretation  has  already  been  written,  a good
 
part  of  my work  is  already  done  ,stored  in  first  draft  on
 
the  pc.
 I expect  to  bring  in  a jazz  scholar  as  a
 
collaborator,  to  edit  my  stuff,
 
to
 stiffen  the mix with
 
dates, brief  bios,  and  quotes  from the artists.  The completed
 
fil mography  ,
 the discography and  the  700  codings  can  be
 
printed  in  hard  copy  from  the  pc,  which  the grant
 -funded  -
 
THE  COMPUTER SIDE
 
Here  ,
 as  is  so often  the  case  with  programming,
 
there  have  been  delays.  The earlier  data  and  its  specialized
 
software at  first  seemed  totally outofreach,  for  they
 were
 
stored  in  an  early form of  Fortran  on  the Columbia
 
mainframe.  For  a time  it  looked  as  if  this  problem  could  not
 
be  solved  without  a large ammount  of  money  and  time,  and
 
that  perhaps  the data  itself  might  be  lost.  However,  with
 
computer  advances,  with  careful,  small  expenditures  and  with
 
a little  help from some  friendly  programmers,  we  seem to  be
 
out  of  those
 woods.  What  has  been  accomplished  will  not
 
only answer  the needs  of  URBAN  STRAIN  but  lead  to  important
 
long-term  results.
 
1).  The
 roject's  data  bases  in  song.  movement,  
52ee0h,  orchestration,  etc.
 have  been  re juvenated,  and  made
 
retreiveable  on  the 2c.  
Data  entry 2ro qrams  have  been
  
written
 see  a22endix
  so that  a student  helper  can  enter
 
the  new data  into the computer.  This  not  only  facilitates
 
the entry of  the Urban  Strain  codings,  but  makes  it  possible
 
to do
 future coding  directly  into a
 pc.  The next  step  is
 
to equip a lap-top with a program for  multi-modal  stylistic
 
obervation  of  expressive  behavior.  With such a portable
 
field  instrument  one could  record  ,store,  anal yze,  and
 
compare data  on  non-verbal  events  as  they  occured  anywhere--
in  the theatre  or  in  the jungle.  I believe
 this  will  make
 
the methods  we  have devel oped  generally  useful  in  the
 
humanistic  sciences.  This  phase  of  the  programmina'  work  was
 
S
 
S
 
S
 
done  by  the  remarkable  Andy  Biskin,  with  help  from  the
 
Center  for  Social  Science.
 
2)  Our  highly  useful  anal ytic  programs  have  not
 
been  yet  been  made user-friendly,  though they soon  will  be.
 
Meantime  a smaller  set  for  use on  the Urban  Strain  data  have
 
been  created  by Mike del  Rio with  input  of  that  generous
 
comoputer  scholar  -
 anthropogist  ,
 Dr.  Douglas  White  .These
 
programs  make  possible the assembl y of  single  profil es,
 
modal  profiles,
 
clusters  of  codings,  and  the  comparison  of
 
styl es  in  terms  of  their  rank on  singl e variables  ,
 either
 
within  the  pop music  set  or  the global  data  banks
 
A first  sample of  their  output  is  hereby
 
appended  .
 In  it  the  reader  can  note  how
 key  differences  in
 
African  and  Europen  appear  in  pop
 music.  These appear  in
 
the  rank  order  comparison  of
 a set  of  African,  European,
 
and  American  cultures  on  three measures  -
-
 The Social
 
Organization  of  the  Singing  Group  ,
 The  Importance of  Solo
 
versus  Group  Performance,
 The  Level  of  Repetition  in  Song
 
Texts.
 The  data  from  each  culture  is  typidal  of  its  zone
 
and  type.
 
The
 distinctive
 African  trait  of  overlapping
 
choral  parts,  is
 rare  in  Europe  ,
 frequent
 in  Afro-America
 
and
 prominent  in  USPOP....  Solo  performance
 is  dominant  in
 
Europe  and  in
 USPOP,  whereas  group  performance  is
 
I
 
S
 
S
 
characteristic  of  Africa  and  Afro-America,  and  about  as
 
common  in  USPOP  as  it  is  in  Moravia  (near  the  homeland  of
 
the  operetta)....  Groups  in  which the  leader  is  submerged
 
are  most  charactweristic  of  Africa
  
Repetition  of
 
text  in  singing  is  frequent  in  Africa,  the  Vest  Indies  ,
 and
 
to a lesser  degree  in  folk  Europe
 On  the contrary Urban
 
Europe  is  characteristically wordy  ,
 as  in  the  profile of
 
USPOP
 and,
 to a lesser  degree,  in  that  of  urbanizing
 
Southern  US. .
 .
 -
 
At  these
 levels,  at  least,  USPOP,  combines
 
characteristics  of  AFRICA and  urban  EUROPE  .
 Solo singers  or
 
groups,  in  which  leaders  play an  important  role  and  in  which
 
parts  often  overlap  in  African  style,  perform  largel y non-
repetitious  texts.  This  is  a powerful  stylstic  formula  which
 
has  shaped  much  of  American  pop  tradition.
