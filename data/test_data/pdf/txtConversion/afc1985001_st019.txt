Crawdad Song
CRAWDAD SONG 4142 55B1
Mrs. Allen Shafter, 1940
Wake up honey you've slept too late Unk, unk Wake up honey you've slept too late
Crawdad man done passed your gate Unk, unk, unk-unk, unk-unk, unk-unk, unk-unk, unk.
The old duck hen said to the drake No more crawdads in this lake.
Sold my crawdads three for a dime Your crawdad's not as fat as mine.
Whatcha gonna do when the lake goes dry Sit on the lake watch the crawdads die.
