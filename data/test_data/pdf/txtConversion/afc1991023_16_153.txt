TX01: G—Atsion; 22GT (001-050) 
Mother's family settled in a 
community called Flyatt in the 1700's. (Across Route 206 from 
Atsion toward Atco on the north side of the lake.) First property 
that they purchased was 
in 1789. There were two brothers who were 
for years after called the Hessians, but not sure whether it was 
because they were Germans or because they were on the British 
side fighting with the Hessian troops during the Revolution. 
(across the next intersection) We don't have much information 
because they probably deserted, 
in fact they had an alias, Bell, 
in fact the earliest document he could find in Mt. Holly had them 
listed as John Bell alias John Crain, the son of Benjamin Bell 
and we could never find out which was the original name, and 
whether they were using the alias because they were deserters. We 
figured that Crain or Bell might have been their mother's name. 
After the original property that they bought, when the Indian 
reservation went up for sale they bought quite a large acreage 
from them also. They bought from the Leni Lenape who decided to 
leave the state and sold their reservation lands. Reservation was 
established in the 
late 1700's. They had believed that the one at 
Indian Mills was the first reservation in America, but now 
Delaware claims that they had a reservation of an earlier date. 
(More discussion of the Indians). I belong to the 
local 
historical society, and I went to Mt. Holly quite a few times 
looking up deeds. I did make a family tree. 
My great grandmother 
died 
in 
1926. My great grandfather died 
in 
1912, 
long before my 
time. 
(5 minutes) 
(051-100) This farm belonged to the Bozarth family (Atsion 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel

page 1 
road into Medford Lakes, a few miles from Atsion). Descendants of 
the last Bozarth family, whose name 
is Abrams, which is a large 
family in this area live here now (north side of the road). Area 
has remained pretty stable until the last ten years or so and 
then .some of the farm families so l 
d the i 
r property to make a 
quick profit from the developers. They stayed in the original 
farm houses and sold their property. The intersection we are 
coming to 
is called Patterson's Corner or another name for it 
is 
Dellett. There was a family whose last name was Dellett, who had 
a tavern here and some of our ancestors did marry into the 
Dellett family, and this was one of five taverns in the township. 
The building was right here until about ten years ago. (We made a 
right turn here from Atsion Road.) Now this is marked as Jackson 
Road. The Patterson was for a later tavern owner. 
Down the road 
is another marker. Steve read the marker: 
The Brotherton Indian Reservation founded 1758 began here, 
originally contained 3,284 acres. Indians moved to New York. Land 
sold at auction in 
1802. 
That's when the Crains bought it. 
It was almost like a lottery 
system, and the Crains got to buy about 160 acres. Eventually 
they owned all 
the property from Patterson's corner to Flyatt. 
The land was owned by them or by families that they married into 
They were listed mostly as farmers in the early census records. 
They owned both sides. 
(100-162 )The area around here was known as the Braddock 
farm, and the first cranberry bogs were planted by Braddocks. 
This little house goes back to about 1810. The family's name was 
Wilkins and it's just about the only brick house around here, 
because bricks weren't made here. A lot of times they came in as 
ballast on ships or from Pennsylvania but it was very expensive 
to have a brick house this far from transportation, brick yards 
and so on. Almost all the buildings in this area were wood frame 
It was lived 
in until the 1950's. 
It was 
a tenant house. The 
farmer lived elsewhere 
and his tenants lived here. The field is 
soybeans. The drought didn't hurt them because they've been 
irrigated. 
(10 minutes) 
When the 
iron works was 
in progress in Atsion, they did have 
a landing 
in Lumberton, and 
it was called the Atsion landing and 
I have an 
idea that on some of the trips that they would take 
iron products up to the landing and bring bricks back, and this 
may have been built with those bricks since 
it was built after 
the 
iron works was established. This was considered a wealthy 
man's house. and their income was more than likely from farming. 
This was property that was purchased after the Indians moved away 
because the date was 1809. The sign reads: 
Old Brick house erected by Clayton Wilkins in 
1809 on 
land 
left him by his father Amos Wilkins. John Sorden purchased the 
homestead in 1841 and lived here for many years.

The Wilkins were related to the Crains. You know in those days 
with transportation as difficult as 
it was, most people married 
into 
local families, either for the convenience or for expanding 
their holdings or whatever. 
There were a few Quaker famili 
if the Wilkins themselves were 
and a few were Baptists. (Acro

That was a one-room school house, and they would have had 
teacher for all 
the grades, and the teacher would go from 
to family and receive room and board and a small salary. A lot of 
times they came from larger cities. Even a place like Mt. Holly 
might send a few teachers down. Across the field there is winter 
rye planted. We discussed the age of a nearby tree, as having 
been there when the Cranes were there. More recently a family 
called Jennings came 
in and bought most of this land which was 
Crain land - a man named John Henry Clay Jennings came 
in the 
1860's 
and then the tavern eventually passed into the hands of 
the Jennings.

The next corner is the site of the Flyatt tavern, so 
practically every corner had a tavern, and when the Crains first 
came here, this 
is where the original holdings were in 
1789, and 
then they started buying adjoining land. There was a cellar hole 
in 
this area. I think its been filled in here now (on the

and 
is still here from the 
1860's. (Turn) 
There were two houses next to one another that were built by 
the Crain brothers. One house survived, the 
other fell apart or 
was torn down. I spoke to a doctor who was a Jennings and had 
grown up on the farm and he told me that once when he was a boy 
he was playing under a pear tree and found an old British coin 
and being foolish, as kids are, he was doing tumble-saults and 
lost his coin. 
(Left turn) 
Rest of family is 
interested but has not pursued looking into 
the family as much as I have. 
(Back at Tumble Inn corner at Indian Mills Road) 
This 
is the other boundary of the reservation. 
The signs were put up by the Indian Mills Historic Society. 
Looking where the barn is, there was a small house that was even 
smaller at one time. The front section is new but the Cape Cod 
section 
in the back was the original home that the Crains had 
built after they bought the reservation land, and there were 
supposed to have been two houses side by side. The man who lives 
there 
is named after his great grandfather, John Henry Clay 
Jennings. Driveway is bordered by collards(?) and they have 
asparagus and strawberries, and they sell beef that he once 
in a 
while raises. When I was a kid, we used to come up here because 
they had dairy cows and when we wanted to get our cow freshened 
for the year, we'd come up to the Jennings farm, and leave the 
female until she got mated and she'd have her calf. A lot of the 
people still have a little vegetable garden. They use most of the 
acreage for farming the larger crops and decided since the house 
was so far back from the road to utilize that spare, which is 
almost an Irish custom, which 
is what we saw in traveling in 
Ireland this summer, the larger parts being used for the cows or 
sheep and the little part in front of the house being used for 
vegetables. 
(20 minutes) 
The people here of Scotch-Irish descent. Knowing the couple, 
probably both of them come out and work the garden, as a matter 
of fact they belong to the historic group as well. Steve bought 
his house in 
1380. It's known as the Cavileer house and at one 
time 
it was one of the cottages for the iron works, and then when 
later owners decided to sell 
some of their holdings, 
it was 
purchased in the late 1800's and has been privately owned ever 
since. It was part of the Richards holdings when they had the 
iron furnace. 
The next farm is part of the Gatley farm and they are 
descended from the O'Neils who came here to work in the iron 
works and they name here to work 
in the late 1700's, early 
Rubinstein--83 Reel-to-reel

page 4 
1800's. Most of the old homesteads are older couples now, but 
these new places have kids that go to the local schools. This 
would be the Gatley farm, so some of the newer houses are the 
younger Gatleys. The farm over here on the right is part of the 
Abrams farm, and they were one of the largest land holders in the 
area. The Bozarth farmstead is being farmed by Abrams who had 
married into the Bozarth family. And the farm on the left is also 
an Abrams farm. The field 
is harvested soy beans. This 
is 
the 
Wright farm and they were related to the Crains through a later 
marriage and the Wrights were related to the Wolmans and they 
were Quakers, and John Wolman was noted in the Mt. Holly area as 
someone who travelled to England frequently, did a lot of 
writings on Quaker philosophy in the 1700's. There were a few 
Quaker families but not as many as you would find in Moorestown, 
Medford or whatever. This was mostly Methodist, Baptist and this 
was on the circuit - there were circuit preachers coming by. 
(We 
are about a mile and a half to two miles from the Tumble Inn 
corner.) 
It just so happened that most of the people who settled 
here got land through the lottery, and they had common interests, 
and wanted land here, but it does not seem that they came from 
the same area in England. A lot of them were deserters from the 
Revolution, others were speculators that came 
in when the ground 
became available. 
(25 minutes) 
Each was a hundred fifty, a hundred sixty acres in those 
days, but even now most fields would be fifty, sixty acres. Now 
this whole development has come about in the last ten years and 
at one time it was a farm and when I went to school this was all 
farm land. They call 
it Barton Lakes development. Since it's been 
built, the lake has become polluted, because the septic systems 
have infiltrated under the ground and into the stream. This was 
mostly forested when the Indians lived here and the farmers 
cleared the ground. Fifty years ago Steve's house was surrounded 
by fields and 
it 
is only after the State bought the property that 
they allowed it to grow up into trees again, but when my 
grandfather was living and worked for the Wharton Estate, when it 
was privately owned, he used to mow it and keep the area clipped.

ET:There does seem to be a trend toward having the forest closer 
to your life now. People like to have their houses surrounded by 
trees. 
SS: Right, I enjoy privacy. That's why I don't bother cutting the 
trees back. G—Atsion; 22GT 
ET: Do you worry about fire? 
SS: No. I have a stream in the back and a pump hooked up so that 
I'm more or less protected if a fire should come too 
close .... This 
is the athletic field for the township, 
one of the 
athletic fields. Now this little area up here was known as the 
settlement of Indian Mills. This 
is what you would consider a 
town 
in those days. When people would come into 
town they would 
come up 
into this area, and there was a general store and post 
office at one time and a couple other little shops... And they 
have school today. Look at all 
the cars. (NR: I thought school 
was closed today.) Some schools are. My cousin had school today. 
But they get a week of deer season off, because so many kids used 
to take off that they go on these smaller holidays and get a week 
off at deer. 
ET: So this is an elementary school that we are looking at? 
SS: Yes, K to 8, and from here the kids go to a regional high 
school. I teach elementary school 
in Waterford Township, 
remediation, 4th, 5th and 6th grades. But I was one of the few 
people from this area until more recent times, that ever went to 
college. It was more or less expected that if you went through 
high school, you were ready to go 
into Iife...A lot of the people 
are 
in 
industrial professions. They're electricians, carpenters, 
builders. ..Most (of the farmers) are large 
operators and a few 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 6 
even have property in Florida whatever farms there that they work 
also... A few people came 
in, 
as I mentioned the Crains came 
in 
in the 1780's and bought land that was on the fringe areas of the 
reservation and then when the property went up for sale, expanded 
their original holdings. The Leni Lenape Indians supposedly 
operated a saw mill here and 
had their own school. 
ET: You hear about the civilized tribes, the Cherokee and the 
Shawnee. Would they be considered part of that group? 
(more discussion of Indians) 
(weather) 
ET: The sense of these open fields and the dense forest up 
against them..I would think that would have some feel 
to the 
people who've lived here for a long time, you know either 
security ... 
SS: Well, I enjoy privacy, but the reason there's forest over 
beyond that field is because that's a wet area. There's a stream 
that goes down through that into a lake and usually the trees 
were allowed to grow along the stream. They could clear up to the 
edges, the wetlands, and leave the trees along the stream. 
ET: Are you familiar with the cold spots and the warm spots in 
the area around here? I've heard that there 
is quite a 
variation,.. and I don't know what causes those cold spots.. 
SS: Just the natural 
lay out of the land. It sort of catches the 
sun, 
let's say. You know if you had a curve, higher land and 
you're facing the sun, then you'll have a warm spot in 
there... Sometimes trees were left to act as hedgerows to keep the 
wind from lowering the temperatures.... 
I went to Virginia for a year and I came back to New Jersey, 
Glassboro State College. 
NR: Why did you leave to go to Virginia? 
SS: There were no openings at Glassboro at the time, so I went to 
Virginia and took courses at the University at Falls Church, and 
then transferred up to Glassboro. I had an uncle who was living 
there (Va.) at that time, and my aunt was in education, so 
it was 
a good opportunity for me to go down... on my father's side,.. 
this 
is the town of Indian Mills, and at the corner you'll see 
the Methodist church. 
(5 minutes) 
NR:Was that the Methodist church that was standing when 
you were 
growing up there? 
SS: When my grandfather was young, this was the church that they 
would attend, and on the opposite corner is the general store, 
and we'll want to make a left hand turn at this intersection. 
(picture) 
SS: There is a marker on the other side, where those boys are 
sitting that mentions Indian Ann, and I'll show you where she had 
lived... 
In the 1950's they 
built the addition. 
ET: 
Is this still pretty much the largest church in the area? 
SS: Yes. As a matter of fact the Baptist church that was here, 
called the Centennial Baptist church closed completely for lack 
of members and it's only been 
in 
recent years that enough people 
have expressed an 
interest, that they built a new church, the 
Shawnee Baptist church a few miles from here... Yes, 
it

ET: Are you a member of any 
local churches? 
SS: No. 
ET: 
(re. celebration) (celebration) 
SS: They still have pot pie dinners from time to time. 
ET: 
Is that considered a money raiser? 
SS: Social too, I think. As a matter of fact, at one time 
it was 
called the Harvest Home and 
it was always held in the fall...(The 
grounds) were donated by a local family with the emphasis being 
that the church had to use it once a year 
or else the deed would 
pass back to the family that made the donation, and so they used 
to have what was called the Harvest Home and all 
these families 
would come and bring some kind of a dish and then that idea after 
the Second World War it sort of, even during the war, the idea 
was dropped, then they were afraid they were going to 
lose the 
property, so each year now they use 
it for an Easter sun rise 
service and sometimes during the summer they have camp meeting 
type service, so that they fulfill the restrictions on the deed. 
( 
left turn) 
The farm where these houses are 
is called the Braddock farm, 
and that was another branch of the Braddocks.. Now the place up 
here on the left was the Treat house, supposedly a stage stop at 
one time. It was modernized in 
the 1800's. They also call 
it the 
Thompson home... 
Edward T. Thompson, former state assemblyman, 1871 — 1873, 
township official resided here. Home built in 
1807 by Thomas 
Bedford. A store and post office also here. 
For some reason it has the name the treat house also. As a matter 
of fact, one of the Jennings had purchased it 
in more recent 
years, maybe 
in the late 40's early 50's and then they sold all 
the ground around 
it for the development and now the house itself 
is 
up for sale. 
Bedford Mills, site of grist and saw mill complex erected by 
Thomas Bedford in 
1807. Once was site of original Indian grist 
mill which burned in 
1762. 
There is a little spillway in here that you can see, but the dam 
had been reconstructed and any of the remains might have been 
buried under the dam, as often happens... People here had grown 
up with a sense of history, but they never pursued it until the 
Bicentennial was coming about. 
(10 minutes) 
ET: This Indian Mills lake, 
is that artificial? 
SS: Yes. That was a stream back in Indian times and it was dammed 
up, 
and the grist mill built here. 
(Route 206 and Oak Shade, no, Willow Grove Rd.) 
The other road 
is further up. This 
is Willow Grove. 
(straight across) 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 8 
The owner of the stock yard here 
is Robert Aristone 
and he 
is also mayor of Indian Mills, but this was Abrams ground at one 
time, and he came 
in with a great deal 
of money and purchased it. 
(travelling northeast on Willow Grove Rd.) 
And we're going toward a little intersection called 
Oriental. No one seems to know how it got that name... 
(tried to take pictures of farm workers, but were refused) 
The property in this area was owned by the Scott family and 
my great grandmother 
Crain was a Scott, Rebecca Scott Crain and 
her family owned the property on both corners to the right and 
toward the left, 
and we want to turn right. This 
is Tuckerton Rd 
and Indian Mills Rd, but it's also called Willow Grove Rd. At one 
time there was a tavern here also. The Oriental Inn was torn down 
in 
the 1970's. That corner is known as Oriental 
in this little 
area. 
It 
is a crossroads settlement. (There is a big new house on 
a high piece of 
land.) There was a tavern a little further down, 
but this was the coach stop on Tuckerton Road, country store and 
post office. Believe stables maintained here for horses to 
relieve those drawing the stage coaches... The building goes back 
to the 1880's. (ET: Looks like 
it has a flat roof) That's typical 
of the architecture of that time... (east on Tuckerton Rd.) (NR: 
This 
is 
the other section of the same Tuckerton Rd. we were on 
before.) We were about two miles up the other way when we were at 
Flyatt, then we came around through Indian Mills and we're back 
on Tuckerton Rd. (Right turn onto dirt road) The property up here 
is being developed. They have made changes, but this was the old 
entrance into where my great grandfather was born. 
(15 minutes) 
This area was known as the Horner place and my great great 
grandmother was given this piece of property by her father and 
she lived 
in a log cabin home and had seven children. And my 
great grandfather, Isaiah, was born 
in this place, the log cabin. 
His grandfather's name was Isaac. They developed it and the roads 
do come 
in from another direction, but I'm not sure exactly of 
the complete layout. 
1860's is when this property was given to 
my great great grandmother. 
SS: Now this 
is 
all 
sort of newly laid out. (right) 
ET: You don't know what street this is? 
SS: No it's completely different. 
ET: The development is called Wallingford. 
NR: These are expensive homes. Now where are these people coming 
f 
rom? 
SS: A lot of them work Cherry Hill, Philadelphia, that area. Some 
at the casinos. Maybe we're back on the same road. We are, so 
just turn around, we'll go up the other way. We're back on 
Tuckerton Rd... 
NR: Artificial community named Wallingford. 
SS: Yes, you'd think they would have named it Horner Place or 
something after the original name of the area. 
NR: Did you spent much time 
in this area when you were growing 
Rubinstein--83 Reel-to-reel

up, or was this too far away. 
SS: No we'd come here all 
the time, because my grand—dad was born 
here and this is the place I wanted to show you, the foundation 
anyway of where he was born, and he often came back, his memories 
from back then, he enjoyed it. That's sort of the area we wanted 
to get into over there. I guess it's not that important. The 
little foundation for the chimney is still there at the end of 
this little dug out area. No, 
it doesn't matter, but like I said 
it's been changed so much that, no, 
no, we'll go on to... 
(20 minutes) 
(right turn) 
You can see we're on quite a ridge. 
(left turn) 
And we'll go to the local cemetery. This 
is called 
Dingletown Road and 
it was named for Dingletown in Ireland. We're 
turning north on Dingletown Road from Tuckerton Road (passing a 
gun club) A lot of these clubs are fellas from outside the area, 
a few are local people but most are outsiders. 
Left up here at the sign, and that's Carranza Rd. The 
memorial 
is to the right, but we're going Ieft.Now originally 
this was all Shamong township and then in the 1870's 
it was sub— 
divided into Shamong and Tabernacle townships. So the people from 
the Indian Mills/Shamong area are buried 
in the Tabernacle 
cemetery. And before 
it was Shamong, 
it was part of Evesham 
township.... 
(25 minutes) 
Isn't that a beautiful place? That's Dr. Bende's home. He's 
a veterinarian that makes house visits, believe it or not. And he 
has a truck that's fully equipped, for large animals.. I had him 
in for one of the goats one time.

2MIK: 
TX01: This is one of the G—Tabernacle; 25GT schools. When I was a 
kid, this was the only school 
in Tabernacle. It was built in 
'36. 
In the distance you can see the middle school, and they have 
another school besides. Tabernacle had a Methodist Church which 
is just ahead of us and we're going to stop where the 
little gate 
buildings are. That's the cemetery. We would come here to the 
cemetery for the holidays like Memorial Day and decorate the 
graves. 
It was redone again 
in 
1980. 
If you look at these stones, 
Sidney R. Scott was my grandfather's grandfather. In fact 
grandfather's name was Sidney R. Crain and that was his 
grandfather.. that he was named for. They were Mormons, and no 
one can understand how it came about. They were from the East 
Coast at one time and it must have been that they went west with 
Brigham Young and apparently became disillusioned and then did 
return. 
In other words this was the children that were born out 
in the west. So these were children that were young at that time 
and they did return with their parents to this area and 
it was 
just a coincidence that I was talking to a distant relative a few 
years ago and I asked about the Utah connection and she said, oh, 
you mean the Mormons. And this 
is what they've always been 
referred to. 
It was the first I had heard of 
it. Evidently 
in the 
Scott family that's sort of how they always differentiated these 
particular members of the family and so they did go out and 
returned. And over in that corner will be a gravesite of the 
Crains... Now these are local families from Indian Mills and 
Tabernacle. A lot of these names are from both areas. Now at one 
time the little building where 
it says Holly Flowers was the 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 11 
general store here in Tabernacle. That was owned by a family 
named Haines that we were related to 
in some way. Richard Haines 
had this. I've never really pinpointed what the exact 
relationship was. I know they were cousins to my grandfather. The 
Wrights were related to the ones I mentioned in 
Indian Mills that 
were related to the Woolmans, and they were distant cousins.As a 
matter of fact, Sarah was a Woolman, Sarah White was a 
Woolman...Now this was Isaiah Crain who was born 
in 1862 and died 
in 
1912. All 
right now, my great grandmother had later remarried 
and I don't know if they have her grave marked.. Rebecca W. Crain 
who later married a second time, Joseph C. Kline. So she was 
buried next to her first husband actually and yet she was married 
to someone else. I think his family may have had a grave site in 
a different cemetery. Over there you can see the graves of some 
of the Willetts. Further over, Wells, Elizabeth Wells, John 
Wells, they were also related. Another Crane marker. There were 
three spellings, Crane, Craine, and Crain, but they were all 
the 
same family. 
It just depended on who registered the births or 
deaths or whatever and however they decided to spell 
it. history 
(6 minutes) 
Here are some additional Scott graves. Some more Wrights. 
ET: Where do you think you'll be buried? 
SS: 
In Atsion, the Atsion cemetery across from my house. That's 
the present general store 
in Tabernacle, (Nixons, huh?). they 
sell 
all 
kinds of Piney power T—shirts, buttons, stickers and 
things like that. This 
is the grave site of Indian Ann, the last 
of the Delawares, died 1894, 
in her 90th year. Erected by the 
Burlington County Historical Society, and she was the last Indian 
here after the others moved away. Her father remained and she was 
born here and stayed on. 
NR: Was the Leni Lenape a branch of the Delaware? 
SS: Yes,.. There's Ira Crain—I'm looking for Hannah Crain, I 
knew it was near Indian Ann's, but I don't want to take too much 
time looking for it. All 
right, now the Kutz family was another 
large family 
in this area.. (discussion of the initials on the 
foot stone) .. 
I'm sure it was right up 
in that area unless 
someone has taken the marker for some reason. Wilkinson was 
another large family 
in the area. Cottons were related to us. 
There's another Crane, William Crane over there. (1895 and 6) As 
a matter of fact Thomas Cotton was a Justice of the Peace at one 
time 
in the area. I thought she was right over there. It's an 
older marker. It's not one of the newer ones. Here we go. All 
right. This is Hannah Crain. That was my grandfather's 
grandmother, Hannah B. Crain and this was her father Isaac Crain, 
the one that I mentioned gave her the property called the Horner 
Place and his wife, 
Ann Crain, her original name was Ann Hank 
Crain. I often thought it was the same family as Lincoln's 
mother, but it didn't have an "S". She died at 48 years of age, 
and had 6 children. 
(10 minutes) 
In other words that was Isaiah's mother, and that was 
Isaiah's grandfather. She's buried next to her mother and father. 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 12 
It 
is a little different than the others (referring to the carved 
lettering). 
The Wills family 
is another prominent family 
in 
the 
area, or was 
in those days. They do have a newer cemetery. This 
would usually be for people, the older families but just up the 
road 
is a mechanic's cemetery and most of the burials take place 
there now. 
ET: Now isn't that where Shawnee church 
is too? 
SS: I think you can get there from this way.. Sometimes you have 
an older person whose mate was buried here, and they'll still 
bury them here. This 
is Richard Haines whose son was probably the 
one with the 
store later, 
in 
later times... The Taylor family is 
another prominent family 
in this area. and the Prickett family. 
the little general store 
in 
Indian Mills was known as Prickett's 
store when I was young. There's a couple of old carved markers 
(wooden ones) The cap on the one 
in the middle was sort of the 
Gothic style that was popular in the 1800's. 
Log Church. Site of Tabernacle in the Wilderness, 
established 1778 by John Brainerd. Both whites and Indians 
worshipped here. Used as school until 
1885. 
I imagine one reason so many people were Methodists here was 
because of John Brainerd's travels. He was a famous Methodist 
missionary back 
in those days. He rode the circuit and converted 
a lot of the Indians to 
Christianity. 
(On Carranza Rd. heading back the way we came) 
There are some newer developments now, but basically it's 
pretty much like it was thirty years ago. 
(15 minutes) 
That's a little further removed from Cherry Hill.. 
NR: 
Is the historical Society pretty much made up of 
local folks 
though? 
SS: Yes, or descendants of people who were from the area. 
Actually on paper we have about 150 members, and at meetings we 
have 10 to 20. We've put out a booklet on G—Atsion; 22GT and a 
series of plates with historic buildings pictured on them... 
(discussion of the Atsion flea market) 
We are southeast of Tabernacle. 
African M.E. church. Thrived mid 1800's. Burial grounds 
owned by church. George H. Ayres, GI Veteran, Comp E, 23rd 
regiment volunteers buried here. 
That would have been a little black settlement. As a matter of 
fact the very famous Dr. James Still was born just a few miles 
from here. He was called the black doctor of the Pines, and his 
family, his ancestors had been slaves, but he was born here 
in 
the freedom. 
( 
r 
 ght) 
Bozarthtown or Boziertown is 
right up the road. This road 
is 
the Ding letown Road. 
If you had continued straight across you 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 13 
would have come to Bozarthtown road, but it's quite a ways. there 
would be quite a few places that just don't exist any 
longer. 
They're still on the old maps, but 
if you got there, there's 
nothing to mark them. 
(straight ahead) 
I mentioned the Scott's. I can show you where their original 
farm site was. 
There's a modern house replacing the old one that I remember 
as a kid. We make a left by the white building, and the road that 
I was talking about, the road used to go directly across, but 
then they blocked it off when this new house was built. 
ET: Now this crossroads sign says Oriental Rd. Hampton Gate. 
SS: Right, but see the road used to go across from Oriental. When 
we came down looking for the Horner place, this was the main road 
that paralleled the Carranza road let's say, but now it's blocked 
off. You can't get 
in from this direction and that development 
messed up finding it from the other direction. We could have come 
right through here. 
(20 minutes) 
As a matter of fact one of my distant relatives wrote an 
eighth grade paper called the "Road that had no name." He 
interviewed my grandmother's cousin Clarence who's about 30 years 
old now, who was born on this farm here, and he mentioned having 
often walked to my grandfather's house when they were boys and 
it 
was the log cabin with the gun hanging over the fireplace yet. 
All 
right, this 
in here was known as the Scott farm, and the old 
farm house was on a little hill and they've torn it down, and 
built the brick house that you see there today. One of the 
Wrights owns this now. It's 
in bad condition if you go further 
up. The road comes out to a place called Hampton Gate which is 
close to the Chatsworth/Speedwell area. 
It was sort of 
like a 
logging area 
in those days. 
(turn around) 
NR: I asked you once about the house you were born 
in and whether 
it didn't bother you about the condition it was in.. 
SS: I tried to make a deal with the State a few years back. I 
contacted Betty Wilson who is the acting Chairperson of the 
Environmental Committee, and they told me that the house was 
going to be moved 
closer to the mansion site and restored as an 
example of the 1850,s worker type home and the excuse for not 
making a property trade was that 206 was going to be re—routed, 
and that the house would not have access 
in 
or out... They'll 
just let 
it fall 
to pieces. It'll catch on fire mysteriously... 
You know that I own the piece of the property that I have plus 
another piece I figured I had something to negotiate with, you 
know a trade or whatever, but nothing came of 
it. A little 
further up on the right we'll see a marker that was the site of 
Indian Ann's house, and she made her living weaving baskets, and 
walking into Medford and selling them, for people to use to carry 
items or vegetables in. 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 14 
NR: How do you remember this area? 
SS: You mean my feelings about it? I like it. I don't like the 
way it's built up though. At one time this was a gravel road, 
even when I was younger and you'd see two houses the whole length 
of 
it, and now when we get up here, you'll see another 
development. It was right in here I believe. 
ET: How did you recognize that? How did you know it was there? 
SS: Just a sense in a way, remembering. Well I remember when I 
was young there was a black family that lived up the road on the 
other side, and we used to come up here quite often. I enjoyed 
dogs beagles and my grandfather raised them, so we'd come up and 
we'd trade or negotiate. 
ET: 
Is there a landmark though that helps you.. 
SS: No, just knowing we were 
in this area. 
Indian Ann, the celebrated Ann Roberts, 
last of the 
Delawares in this state resided here til 
her death 
in 
1894. She 
has become a legend 
in the Pines. 
(25 minutes) 
It was a little salt box type of house. Someplace I have 
pictures of what it looked like. Have you ever heard the story 
about her father? In this area she was a legend, but .. 
her 
father was born here, I guess the reservation was still 
in 
existence, and he didn't move north with the other Indians, and 
he used to do odd jobs for farmers in the area and so on, and he 
made a deal with a farmer from up 
in the Hainesport or Mt. Holly, 
they called the Rancocas State Park area, that he would do the 
work for the farmer in 
return for cider. He would get paid in 
cider, but the thing was, the cider it was all the cider he could 
carry in a bushel basket. The farmer thinking he was going to 
outfox him, because the basket won't hold the cider, so cider's 
usually made in the fall, so the Indian waited ti) 
the cold 
weather and then he took his basket and went down to the Rancocas 
stream, dipped it 
in until 
it was covered with ice and he went up 
to the farmer and asked for his basket full of cider.

TX01: We're crossing 206 on the Neck Road or the Dingletown Road. 
The sign says Forked Neck. G—Tabernacle; 25GT 
Most of the kids Steve grew up with married, had kids, and a 
lot of them are still 
in the area. 
SS: This is a little section owned by Mahlon Crain who was one of 
my grandfathers, uncles or whatever. I have an uncle that was 
named for him. I had four (deer) that are coming out in 
the 
middle of the driveway and Avon (his goat) didn't sleep 
in the 
cellar last night. She waited out near the driveway to see them. 
I guess they can communicate 'cause she'll make a strange noise 
and they make a noise. 
NR: They're not frightened by her and she's not frightened by 
them? 
SS: No, curious. We're back at the intersection of Indian Mills. 
Let's make a left, toward the firehouse. Turning off 
Medford/Indian Mills road onto Willow Grove Road. (Indian Mills 
is also called Dingletown where it crosses 206.) There's a little 
marker here too, close to the stream. 
Brainerd. The dwelling place of Rev. John Brainerd who was 
missionary to the reservation Indians here from 1759 to 1777 was 
located near this spot. 
Site of sawmill 
in operation here for over two centuries. 
Had been site of original Indian sawmill. Ceased operations in 
early 1900's. 
There's a lake back there which you can't see through the 
undergrowth. 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 16 
Meeting house. Log meeting house where John Brainerd 
preached to the reservation Indians was located near here. Later 
used by whites for worship. Burned to ground in 1809. 
Just after the Indians had left the area. A fellow named George 
Fleming did most of the research. He was sort of 
like our 
historian to the historic society. A couple of other guys and I 
helped to put them up, fill 
in details and so on. The building on 
the right up at the next corner was what was called the 
Centennial Baptist church. That was built in 1826. Eventually the 
congregation sort of waned out, 
and it was even nicer then. They 
made the windows smaller and made it into a store, but until a 
few years ago 
it had larger windows and a different type of 
cupola. The cupola had like four sides instead of 
looking like a 
dog house. 
(left on the corner of Stokes Rod and Willow Grove Rd.) 
And the reason it's called Redmen's general store is because 
after it closed as a church it became a meeting place for the 
Society of Redmen which was sort of 
like the Moose or Elks 
fraternal organization. Their ritual used secret passwords, but 
it wasn't like they were really like descendants of Indians, no. 
You'll see a marker here also which dates back to the 1850's and 
it's one of the places that was pictured on our historic society 
plates. 
Congressman John Jay Gardner, former U.S. Congressman, 1893 
— 1913, made his home here. He was also a mayor of Atlantic City 
(which was called Gardner's Island at one time), State Senator 
and Civil War veteran. 
And the house was actually built previous to his buying it. 
It was built by a man who was I believe a military chaplain from 
Virginia, and this 
is why the house resembles a more Southern 
type home. And then the Congressman bought it and improved upon 
the property. He was known as a gentleman farmer, and he did a 
lot of experimental work with cows and 
beef and so on, sort of 
like Joseph Wharton, sort of 
in that vein, but at one time the 
ground itself was purchased by the Richards family, Jesse 
Richards of Batsto and then he sold it and the chaplain bought it 
and then the Congressman came 
in and bought it, 
and he used to 
raise dogs. They were English sheepdogs which were unusual back 
in that time. 
It wasn't a popular breed here. And his descendants 
still own the property but 
I think they sort of rent it out to 
tenant farmers. They're not living 
in this house any more... It's 
been changed. There have been changes made in 
it. 
It's basically 
still a sound structure. 
(5 minutes) 
There was a piece of ground up here which was donated by the 
Gardner family to the Methodist church. They used to have what 
was called a Harvest Home every year and as 
long as they use 
it 
once a year, the Methodist Church could keep 
it and now they use 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 17 
it for sunrise services at Easter. There's still one Pavillion 
left and part of another. They do use 
it 
in summer sometimes for 
services or for Easter sunrise services. It has to be used once a 
year or 
it goes back to the Gardner family. When I was a kid 
there were sort of 
like picnic tables here, 
and before the 
weather really got cold, all 
the families would come with their 
specialties, 
in a covered dish have a get together here. Now up 
here, you want to go 
left, 
it goes back to a little place called 
Johnstown, which was also named for Johnstown in 
Iowa, and 
there's a few houses there. Across 206... Some of the people here 
have blueberries and others have cranberries and one of the 
families who owns quite a bit of the property is named Munion. 
And it's thought that it's a Huguenot family. As a matter of fact 
the 
little building that I have near the stream, belonged to the 
Munions also. (Steve's house 
was built in 1760's by the Richards 
family as a worker's cottage. There were a half a dozen or more 
others and 
it was one of the few places that was sold when 
Raleigh bought the Richards holdings and sold 
it originally to a 
family of Irish descent, and 
in the early 1900's the Cavileer 
family bought it. I don't know if 
you want to go...it's like a 
bog area a little further back and then it was in 1916 that Joe 
Cavileer was sitting on the porch, and there was a suspicious 
looking vehicle stopped near the church, and he saw men getting 
out with guns, and thought it was a little too early for hunting 
season, so he wrote the license number down on the side of the 
house and found out a few days later that the men had tried to 
hold up cranberry grower, Andrew Ryder and ended up killing 
Ryder's brother and wounding Ryder, and 
it was the license number 
that led to the conviction of the criminals. This was the 
Johnstown area right in here... it's a little area that hasn't 
changed much 
in all 
the years. 
ET: Another hunting club, the Buck hunters.. 
SS: During the forties when a lot of the men got back from the 
War and so on, they wanted to get away from the women and they 
organized gunning clubs, and a lot of the clubs still have that 
unwritten rule, no women, maybe once a year for their annual 
dinner, but that's it.. sort of 
like a captain of a ship, they 
think women bring bad luck, when they travel 
on the ships 
in the 
early days. 
(10 minutes) 
Well the Patterson women 
in this area were always noted for 
hunting and I have seen pictures of some of the hunting gangs and 
there were the Patterson women right in with all 
the men. That's 
an exception really. 
ET: Are those migrant workers houses? 
SS: They were built at one time for the bog workers, see there 
are cranberry bogs right in back there. Johnstown bogs they're 
called. And they were built for people who would come in during 
the harvest season and stay there. I think some of them maybe 
people live on there all 
year long. That's an old cranberry 
building, the shake place. It was used for sorting cranberries 
during the harvest season. This was the center of Johnstown. 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 18 
They're usually shipped out of the area to a larger sorting house 
and done mechanically. 
ET: You can tell I guess because the houses aren't built with 
doors in the gable ends like that usually around here. 
SS: No, they're built on the other side. 
ET: So if 
it has a door in the gable end you sort of assume that 
it 
is some sort of business 
SS: Right commercial, educational, religious type of 
establishment. 
ET: Now who has these bogs now? 
SS: A lot of them belong to the Munions, the family I mentioned 
that may have been Huguenots originally. 
ET: You really know every inch of this area. 
SS: Well, my grandfather and I enjoyed riding together when I was 
a kid. You know we'd just go around and he'd tell me about the 
places. 
ET: Just cruising. 
SS: Right. 
ET: Was he what you might call a woodsman in a way? Was he 
familiar with plants? 
SS: 
It's hard to.. 
I'd say not from an educational standpoint 
where he'd know the Latin names or whatever, but he knew edibles, 
non—edibles etc. and the general species and so on. 
ET: Have you picked up that kind of knowledge? 
SS: Yes. 
ET: Do you gather? Do you eat stuff from the woods? 
SS: Usually from the garden. I'm not into...well, o.k. with the 
mushrooms, there's one type that I used to pick, but they grow up 
toward Mt. Holly. Nothing here 
in the Pinelands because I wasn't 
sure one from the other, but there was one particular species 
which Polish and Russian people pick and my father's family was 
familiar with them, so I pick that particular type. 
ET: What's your last name? 
SS: Soviczki. 
ET: So you're of Polish? 
SS: Polish/Russian. 
ET: Now is your father's family part of the history of this area 
too or.. 
SS: They came after the Second World War with the revolution, the 
Russian Revolution, and never went back. 
ET: So the depth of your sense of place here 
is mostly on your 
mother's side? 
SS: Right. 
ET: Did your father talk much about his family? 
SS: My grandmother used to talk about life 
in Russia. She was a 
monarch as was my grandfather, and they became displaced you may 
as well say, with the Revolution over there. 
ET: 
It sort of sounds like the real source of pride is maybe the 
local 
roots that you have here. 
SS: Right, because this is where I'm based also. 
I'm proud of my 
Russian heritage too, but it's not where I'm 
living there and I 
can visit places that the family was familiar with or whatever, 
and I'm opposed to the type of government that they have at the 
Rubinstein--$3 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 19 
present time. That's why I'm not traveling there. 
NR: Now your dad works up at New Lisbon. 
SS: Yes. He's in maintenance. He's only been there about twenty 
years. he was self—employed before that time, and had no benefits 
coming in more or less, for retirement or whatever. So he took a 
state job and now at least he will have a decent retirement plus 
the benefits. 
(16 minutes) 
(discussion of walnuts on the ground near the car) 
SS: We go back on 206. (returning to the discussion of the house) 
It was known as the Cavileer house. Eventually the older couple 
died, and 
it was passed on through the family, and I bought it 
from the Mrs. Cavileer that the article 
is written about. Her 
husband was born in that house and lived there as a boy, and she 
was born 
in the house in front, the gunning club and later they 
married, but the property stayed within the Cavileer family, and 
she sold 
it to me.

(Re. a map of the Pine Barrens:) 
MB: I don't know anything about the Pine Barrens 
JB: 
I'm not going to draw all 
the roads of the Pine Barrens! 
It 
goes all 
the way down to Cape May . All 
you're 
going to have is 
a big circle with a bunch of names on 
it... 
MB: You're supposed to draw snakes, and I left out a quail 
running across the road. 
(2 minutes) 
JB: Lakewood.. Waretown.. New Gretna. It cuts over towards 
Batsto. It goes 
in at Lower Bank, Green Bank,.. 
MB: I don't know any towns.. 
JB: 
It's a big area. 
It must drop down below Hammonton. It goes 
into..I don't know what's here.. Jackson. 
MB: That's it. That's the towns I know... Roads! 
It's gonna be 
way out of proportion. 
JB: No, don't worry about that. 
(5 minutes) 
NR: You grew up 
in Red Bank, right Mary? What's Red Bank like? 
MB: A lot of commuters up to New York, ritzy people, 
in 
like the 
Rumson, Fair Haven area, Locust.. I never really thought about it 
as being a town... just a place the house was at. I went away to 
school and stuff, but that's all 
(re. having lived elsewhere). I 
went to school 
in Nebraska for a year, and I went to school 
in 
Iowa for a year too. I guess I've lived down here for about four 
years. I lived 
in Manahawkin for a year, on the beach for a year, 
Rubinstein--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 21 
and then, 
in this house for two years...John lived on the island 
for 21 years and spent a lot of 
summers there. His grandfather 
had a house. He was born 
in Camden. 
(10 minutes) 
NR: Who's the guy who lives on the other side of Pearl and Jack 
Cervetto? 
JB: Landgrew (?) He raises horses but doesn't ride them. It goes 
Johnny Watson on the corner, and then 
if you're going down by 
fields, you come to O'Malleys,.. 
MB: No there's a house between Watson's and O'Malleys. 
JB: On Middle Road. 
If you're going by fields. Mr. Smith lives 
there, on Middle Rd. Middle Rd, you go out here, you go up to 
Lucille's, 
it would be the only road on your left hand side 
before you come to Route 539. There's two houses on it. There's a 
gentleman by the name of Smith, and ;O'Malley. 
(15 minutes) 
JB: The only thing I didn't put in this Pine Barrens map is the 
Garden State Parkway. I didn't leave enough room.. 
MB: You better put in one thing, John or we're gettin a divorce. 
JB: What's that? 
MB: 
I'm not tellin  
 The video store, 
that's all I go to 
around this place!! 
(20 minutes) 
NR: Where do you go when you want to get out of the house? 
JB We go to Ocean County Mail. 
NR: Where's your softball team? 
MB: 
In Barnegat. 
JB: Warren Grove isn't even on this map! How about if I like 
to 
go to Hammonton because I work over there. I just think it's a 
nice town. 
It's got a lot of nice things you can buy.

JB: How we found the house was very simple. We have a mutual 
friend that works for Zacharaie (?) realty. She knew I was 
looking for a place to buy. She called me up one day and said 
would you be 
interested in a log cabin. 
It was up 
in Warren Grove 
and that was fine. I had worked this area for twenty years with 
Bell telephone 
MB: I had only been out here once before and I thought, God how 
could anybody remember how to get out here. But I'd only been 
down here a couple of weeks. 
JB: So that's all 
that was here, the cabin and an old garvey 
sitting out front. It was completely built but the floors weren't 
done. There wasn't any furniture to speak of. The floors were 
done here but they weren't done in the bedroom. So we 
looked at 
it. 
We said we'd buy 
it. 
MB: I think we saw it on a Saturday, and that night we went down 
and signed the papers. 
JB: We took possession in May and then we added as we went along. 
We added the garage, 
MB: We put the fireplace in. 
NR: You and your son did that right? 
JB: We did the carpentry work, but we had a mason come 
in and do 
that.. My son and I did the porch and my son built the garage. And 
I built the dog pens and the wood thing. That's about it. Cleaned 
up the area a little. Mostly fallen trees and stuff. 
MB: We were up here three months and the dog ran away. That was 
the first time I ever went in the snack bar. Wanted to put a sign 
up 
in the snack bar. I think 
it was Shirley behind the counter. 
JB: The guy you should interview is dead. Isaac Holloway. He was 
born 
in Sim Place. That's the only place he's ever lived. Sim 
Place and then he migrated to Warren Grove. He died last winter. 
NR: Jack was saying there are still six people who are charter 
members of the fire company 
in fifty five (from the time it was 
established in 
'55)? 
JB: 
I'm not a member anymore. I got out of 
it. I was having 
problems with my blood pressure. 
MB: Bull shit. There's too much bull shit. 
NR: Was that what Olga was talkin about. 
MB: Olga doesn't even know who I am. And she comes up to Nora and 
I and just "Well I lived 
in this town for twenty years and I 
moved from Patterson or some place, I don't know, but everybody 
always wants my stuffed cabbage... 
NR: She said there aren't enough men in the fire company anymore 
or something.. 
MB: I guess I got the impression that she felt the firemen, the 
fire company, 
the men don't do anything 
as far as a fund raiser 
or anything is concerned, and the women did all 
of 
it. The women 
they just have, Laurie Lodregan is the President of the 
Auxilliary and 
they had a cake sale down at the Shop Rite 
in 
Manahawkin about a couple of weeks ago which they just need 
somebody to be innovative or something. They did real well 
last 
night. 
NR: They still won't allow any women in the company? 
MB: Jennifer Sturdivant thinks she's gonna be the first one. They 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 24 
won't let Bill Smith's kid be 
in 
it. They won't let some woman 
in. 
NR: Why won't they let him be 
in 
it? 
MB: They said no. When they voted on his membership they said no. 
You know when there's only 15 — 20 guys 
in the company you'd 
think they'd take anybody they could get. 
JB: There was another guy turned down at the same time. As a 
matter of fact he's Jack Cervetto's..some sort of a relation by 
marriage. 
(15 minutes) 
JB: I don't like too many people on the other end of town, down 
Cervetto Road.A couple of people down there I know... The 
interesting thing about this town 
is the Enduros and then of 
course hunting season brings in a lot of different people. Usually 
when you go to the spectator point Cat the Enduro7 you park and 
you walk. 
(re members of the MCI motorcycle club) 
JB: The only one that belonged to a motorcycle club 
was Richie 
Grasser and that was the South Jersey Stump Jumpers 
or Curly 
Fern or Pine .. 
They come from all over ..

(conversation about softball) 
Played for Tuckerton and Stafford. 
(conversation about Pinelands folklife t—shirts) 
Mary likes the women who play for the Stafford team but they 
don't show up enough so they forfeited the games. They play 
Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday at night at 6:30 but not 
during the winter. Therefore they joined the Nautilus to keep 
their bodies active. The women are from Manahawkin, Ocean Acres, 
Mayetta. One woman works for the post office.They are supposed to 
live 
in Stafford, but they lie to get in. John was a coach and 
was presented with a plaque at the end of the year: 
"Extraordinary Assistant Coach". 
(7 minutes) 
In Tuckerton they are more subdued and 
it 
is more subdued. 
Some of them have full uniforms like 7-11, VFW and Maaco, 
everybody but Stafford and the Barnegat Deli teams. Some of them 
got into fights. Some of them are tough.

Mary's pie recipe: 
6 apples cored and peeled and sliced in pie slices 
Raisins (as much as you want) 
Stew in water until soft 
1 tablespoon flour 
1' teaspoon cinnamon 
1 teaspoon nutmeg 
1 tablespoon sugar 
Mix that up and then pour into the apple mixture and 
let it boil 
for ten minutes. While that's cooking make a pie crust. Pour that 
into the pie crust and make the topping which is: 
1 cup old fashioned oatmeal 
1/2 cup melted butter 
1/2 cup flour 
1 tablespoon sugar 
Pour that into the melted butter until 
it 
is moist and pour it 
over the top. 
(20 minutes) 
Cook at 450 for 10 to 15 minutes and then lower to 350 and cook 
for another 1/2 hour to 40 minutes. 
John can tell 
the change of seasons by the number of beetles 
in the sink. When spring 
is coming you get a few and as the 
summer comes they are bigger and there are more and as the winter 
comes on there are less and less, you know it's getting colder 
and colder. 
(discussion of the carpenter bees that used to live in the wood 
of the cabin) 
MB: You know what is really the prettiest thing around here 
is 
when the mountain laurel blooms. That's really nice... 
(discussion of what they have planted since they moved in:

(this interview begins on PFP83 — RTC004 and RTC005) 
(discussion of guns) 
double barrel 
ten gauge shotgun — 70 years old — my dad used to 
loan 
it out people who wanted to kill geese. 
It was a great 
goose gun. Of course it shot the old paper shells — the old black 
powder paper shells. Modern ammunition would blow it up. That's 
what they call a Damascus twisted steel barrel. Modern powder is 
too potent. You might load your own shells but you'd have to use 
real 
light loads. 
(re Ed's buffle head carvings) 
(discussion of a Rube Corliss black duck) 
You'll notice that Rube's ducks are high on the front, tufted 
breast from the bottom to the bill 
and the reason he made 'em 
that high was because in a blow, when the wind is blowing and 
your duck 
is dipping, and the temperature is falling, that bill 
will hit the water and it'll start to 
ice up, and the first thing 
you know you got an 
icicle about that long on the duck's bill so 
as 
long as he could keep 'em high and keep 'em out of the water, 
he'd keep 'em from icing up just that much longer. That was the 
purpose of that. 
TC: 
It's long too. 
EH: This 
is one of his later black ducks, from about twenty years 
ago. 
(NR: returning from the john...) 
(I 
got to get a new Sears and Roebuck catalog. I've had a lot of 
company this year. Usually the average family would be to the 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 32 
harness section by fall.) 
Ed grew up 
in a big Victorian [toward Carroll's, that is west of 
the present house]. There's a barber shop, then the house on the 
corner, then 
after you go by the street that dead ends into 
Stafford, 
it would be the third house on the left with a big sun 
porch, and a steeple. Never left, only when I went away to school 
and 
in the service and that sort of thing. I went to Temple and 
was 
in the Navy Air Corps for almost four years, 
and I flew 
lighter 'n air out of Lakehurst, and I was assistant instructor 
in school at Quonsett Point, Rhode Island on fighter craft, and I 
helped train some torpedo bomber squadrons, and fighter squadrons 
out in Oxnard, California... Then went on to Guam with the combat 
air patrol and Admiral Nimitz' staff plane. I had a nice career 
in the service, and undoubtedly would have stayed if 
it hadn't 
been for my old grandmother who wanted me home. 
(5 minutes) 
Lots of times it wasn't nice, 
like going ashore on Guam, over the 
sides of the ship and down in cargo nets and up on shore with the 
landing craft, that wasn't nice , but I liked 
it and 
it was a 
nice thing that we were doing. We were again fighting for freedom 
and the folks back home. I was strictly Navy. I really loved 
it. 
I would have made a career out of 
it. She died when she was 97, 
so when she wanted me home she was 87. 
Grandmother and grandad started going to Florida in the early 
1920's and we had a nice home in St. Petersburg, so 
it was going 
down there in the winters, all 
the family, and you know the 
family was travelling inclined. They travelled the Holy Lands and 
North Africa, and over to Italy and France, and all that sort of 
thing. I just liked 
it here. We just stayed home, took off and 
came back, so that part was all 
right. We were a very closely 
knit family, an affectionate family. We just never decided to 
pull 
out and leave as children, like a lot of kids did. They went 
to North Jersey or West Jersey or out of state and that sort of 
thing. No we just continued our roots of 200 some years. And my 
son stays here. He's with the County Road Department. 
(grandson stories) 
About the clamming dog: 
Ed sold two male Labradors to people who live 
in High Bar Harbor 
which is near Barnegat Light and they built a home on the end 
where the dogs have lots of water to romp in. One of the dogs 
paws around and he feels these clams and he pulls them out and 
gets down with his mouth and lays em out on the shore. You go 
down 
in the morning there's not a clam there, you go down 
in 
the 
afternoon and there's four or five clams laying out on the bank 
and the other one chases and catches minnows, but the clam dog 
leaves them out lying there 
in 
the sun and they open up and he 
goes back and eats em. 
These Labradors, I have Musket out there, they don't mind going 
under water. If I cripple a duck and it dives, Musket will dive 
after it and you won't see duck or dog for a few seconds and 
usually when she comes up she has the crippled duck. So the dog 
doesn't mind putting his head 
in the water. They're water dogs. 
It's the gospel truth, doc. They dig these clams and brings em 
Rubinstein--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 33 
out on the bay. 
(11 minutes) 
(more dog stories) 
(re changes in the area) 
Over where the telephone office was there were three houses 
in 
there and there was a big barn called the Big Red Barn and that 
was the stables for the hotel, and the hotel on the corner. Down 
here where the fire house 
is there was a nice big home there and 
that burned down and we bought that for the fire house. The other 
side of the street was the same. Right here was the passenger 
station, and there was a main track and two sidings right in 
here. Across the street was the railroad station where the post 
office is and they moved it on up further. Right in that plot, my 
dad had a coal 
and feed yard and a lumber mill 
in there when I 
was a kid, so

now a private residence, and that was a grocery store and post 
office, dry goods when I was a kid. 
Pearl's CCervetto] father's name was William Hazelton Holloway -
a distant relative. 
(Ed brings out a copy of a book of photographs prepared by the 
Tercentenary Committee of Stafford Township) 
Here's the Methodist Church down here and here's the store across 
the street. And on this corner is where my house is sitting. 
Here's our house up the street, and this apothecary was alongside 
of 
it and then we sold it to Smithville. We sold it to the Noyes. 
Here's my grandfather and grandmother and some other members of 
the family. This is my Great Aunt Maggie Morgan, whose husband, 
Captain Tom Morgan had the beautiful big sailing vessel, the four 
masted schooner, that we have an oil picture of 
in the parlor. 
This 
is Main Street in Manahawkin, and this is the Reuben 
Randolph or Doctor Hilliard House. This 
is the Shinn's funeral

is 
the old 
causeway. The tracks were pulled up 
in 
1938. This big hall was 
right here on the other side of the barber shop. This is the 
railroad station by the barber shop. This is the other side of 
Bay Avenue. This is the Cumberland Farms. Look how it's grown up.

The average sneak box today would cost you $1,000 to 
$1,200. Now 
here a few years ago, we have one of Rube Corliss's sneak boxes 
that was built about fifty years ago. My brother-in-law paid 
about fifty dollars, or seventy five dollars. Now my uncle would 
build you a sneak box for twelve dollars plus the lumber for 
another. Then they got up to twenty, then they got up to fifty,

EH: Comparison of fifty years ago and today. Community hall has 
been built and the station house has been moved. Ed's house was 
built by H. B. Cranmer and son and they did the framing and he 
did the finishing. It was built in 
1951. The old Baptist church 
was built between 1740 — 1749. The British soldiers 
shot the 
windows out of the old church. There was a skirmish there. When 
the church steeple was cut off by Bolton it turned upside down 
and stuck 
in the ground. 
Warren Grove Methodist Church 
Old school house where he went to school — the old railroad 
is 
gone. There was a fence and driveway that led from Beach Ave to 
Stafford. His dad used it to go with a horse and wagon at first 
and then with a motorized truck. Had a coal, feed and 
lumber 
business and on the side was a surveyor. 
The Bonnet Club was a good gunning club, and cousin's husband 
when a little boy, Milton Paul. It was run by the Martins. 
The old railroad draw bridge and the Yellow Jacket (train) with 
Alec Inman and Al 
Brown, Sheriff of Ocean County. 
It was one little old country town, you knew everybody. It's not 
like 
it 
is today. The old timers always called him Ned. Great 
Uncle was Ed called Ned, Jason (grandson) is about the fifth 
Edward. 
The railroad station was 
in front of Ed's house where the barber 
shop 
is. 
(location of the tracks) Tracks separated by the grade 
school on Beach Ave., and came together again here at Bay Ave. 
Rubinstein--83 Reel—to—reel

Trains came through morning, noon and evening and freight 
between. A special came through on Saturday afternoon on the way 
to Beach Haven taking the summer people from Phila. 
(street signs - Main St., Bay Ave., Beach Ave., Stafford Ave., 
Leets Ave.) 
Grocery store and the old Methodist church are across the street. 
(5 minutes) 
Stepping stone has his grandfather's name on 
it - C.H. Cranmer, 
and the post for tying horses and the old Victorian where his 
sister lives. Son drove over the hitching post one day and broke 
it off. 
The old homestead, before grand-dad blasted in and built a sun 
porch out of 
it. 
It was built by a man named Luke Courtney in 
1898 for less than $5,000. His grandmother wanted a linen closet, 
but he said he wouldn't build it.. never heard of such a thing. 
He threatened to quit first and she said well go ahead but I'm 
going to have one. So he quit but he came back in a little while, 
and said he was sorry and would build it. 
They had domestic help. About ten o'clock grandmother would tell 
one of the girls to close the shutters, and about 3 o'clock 
grandmother would say open the shutters. That was 
in the 
summertime to keep 
it cool.The part between the living room and 
the parlor, between the dining room and the living room, between 
the living room and the parlor and between the parlor and the 
hallway, there are recessed sliding doors and the doors between 
he hallway and the parlor and between the living room and the 
parlor were closed every day except Sunday. Sunday you were 
allowed 
in the front room. Grandmother and grandfather designed 
the house. At one time there was a lot of filligree on the ridge 
of the roof. We took 
it off when we pout a new roof on and never 
put it back. It's 
in the barn. This property belonged to a Doctor 
Lane from Tuckerton, and his grandmother was from Tuckerton, and 
they were good friends. He suspects that his grandfather financed 
Lane through school. Grandad bought the property from Lane. He 
moved the house that was there across the street and built this 
house, but Lane's apothecary stayed until they sold it 
in 
1964 to 
Smithville. It acted as town hall, where you voted. It was a post 
office and then different organizations would meet there or for 
anyone who wanted a little party. 
The next house was owned by the Hilliards, but was originally 
built by 
Reuben Randolph who was captain of the Monmouth militia 
of Stafford township. 
Main Street to Route 9? 
Was 12 years old when they came through with a cement road and 
they used to 
sit up there and look at 
it from the old hotel. 
It's still called Main Street. It's Routes 9 & 4. 
Baptist Parsonage was moved across the street by his grandad, and 
in 
the back was the first telephone office. 
(10 minutes) 
Grandad's general store at the dead end of Beach Ave. and across 
the street was the old Elmer Cranmer property and what set there 
at one time was the Manahawkin Tavern - the 2nd regiment of the 
Monmouth militia, who Reuben Randolph who built the earlier house 
Rubinstein--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 39 
was the captain of the militia. Cranmer house 
is on the grounds 
of the Tavern. 
(story about the kid that worked as a laborer for his Uncle Henry 
who was a college graduate in engineering - [the value of work]) 
National Hotel on Stafford Ave, the Em Hall property, the 
Triangle garage - people put flowers in the triangle in the road. 
What is now Couch 40's oil plant was moved by grandad. People by 
the name of Lowerys lived there - both brothers killed themselves 
in the house which is still standing. 
The Old Stone Store and the red mill 
in back of 
it. 
This old building was moved to the back of the hotel and fastened 
on for kitchen facilities. 
Seymour Shute's blacksmith shop. 
"I 
can still smell the horse's 
hooves burning." Mill Creek runs by here and he had a tin cup 
here on a string and you'd walk over to this side by the creek 
and throw the cup out and get a cup full 
of water on a .string and 
drink it. 
(15 minutes) 
Aerial views of what was Russ Horner's Esso station. 
Big homes they used to go to - too far to go by himself, but went 
with the Lowery boy by horse and wagon. 
Went up to the lake 
in swimming, over to school and as far as the 
Baptist church, when 
a little older and had the paper route and 
served the Bulletin, over to Uncle Henry's and Aunt Rachel's, 
down to Bill Cranmer's. Kids were right around. We didn't go too 
far. Further was with older sisters or gunning with his dad. Kids 
were 
in the center of the town. Never went to Cedar Run until 14 
or 15 when they went to play football or baseball, and summer 
time to the Bay. 
Broadway, past the Stone Store. 
Division Street next street up on the right. 
Leets Ave 
Oil Station is still there but there are big tanks then and now. 
Manager was (previously mentioned) Alec Inman from the railroad, 
and lived up here and 
in back there was the stables with 4 big 
black horses that pulled the tanks around. 
John Paul farm 
Up Division St and went across to Beach and that's as far as you 
went. 
Division Street was a two rut road. 
Still had a lot of Model T's when he graduated from high school 
in 
1931. Grandad 
had a Cadillac Touring, and dad had an Overland 
Touring, and they were put up 
in 
the winter time. No anti-freeze, 
lights were acetylene tank lights and were "fluke-y", used 
kerosene in the radiator and they were cold. Ed got a Model A 
in 
1931. Only kid 
in high school had a car as a senior. "Not 
bragging, just pleased." Cousins had a Caddie and a Packard 
Beach Ave looking toward the old school 
Bay Ave. which 
is called 72. "This 
is what it was like when I was 
a kid. These houses are gone " 
Re. Changes: 
"I 
don't like 
it. I like progress. It has been controlled 
progress to a certain extent around here but of recent years it's 
Rubinstein--83 Reel-to-reel 
logs 
page 40 
really gotten out of hand. It's really gotten out of control. You 
go down here to the Shop Rite Plaza where I used to rabbit hunt 
and shoot quail and run with my dogs and all 
that kind of stuff 
and now it's loaded with cars and people and strangers you don't 
know anybody and all 
that sort of thing you know. It's altogether 
different. It's altogether different. " 
(20 minutes) 
(Bolton and Cranmer houses are reversed on the pages 
in 
the 
Stafford volume.) This is the Bolton cottage. That's as far north 
as I went when I served papers... 
Stafford Ave looking towards Ed's house. We used to have all 
these nice old trees, and the Old Hotel and then it was re-
modelled. 
The houses were moved with horses. What they'd do was jack them 
up, 
and they'd have big rollers or big planks and they'd use 
these planks to get the thing out 
in the road. They'd grease 
these planks and then they had what they called a winch. A big 
drum which would be quite a ways out ahead of the house 
in the 
middle of the road and they would secure that. Then this horse 
would walk around and there was a cable from the drum to the 
house, and as he walked around it clicked, had cogs on 
it and 
would click, so 
it couldn't go backwards. The horse would walk 
around and he'd pull 
the house on these rollers or these wheels 
whatever they'd put it on or greased plank would slide right 
along, and they'd pull 
it up to the winch and then they'd have to 
move the winch way ahead secure, fasten it somehow, and then 
start the horse around again until they'd pull.. 
Here's Cavalry cottage, and Greer, old colonel Greer.. this house 
was across from "Sip and Dip" going down Bay Ave and 
it was about 
one of the oldest houses 
in the township or the area. "Now it's 
gone. That's the trouble. So many things got away from us. Before 
we realized we should save 'em. " 
(Re time spent with people from Warren Grove and other areas -
they would shop from his dad, but he didin't know who they were.) 
Dad would go up once 
in a while and see this Mr. Harvey Corliss 
and he raised good turnips, and dad would go up and get a couple 
of bushels of turnips early 
in the spring and put them in the 
cellar, but to know 'em, 
no. 
In high school I got to know Cranmers. 
When you reached the age where you had a car, and you started 
going around and bumping into them at the bowling alley or at the 
movies or something like that, you got acquainted that way.

As a kid I would leave the kennels, Dad had nice kennels over 
there, and I would go get a pair of rabbit dogs and my gun, and 
walk right down the street or go across this lot down through the 
fields, anywhere's you wanted and you knew everybody and Uncle 
Henry would come up the road with a couple of fox dogs, and Mr. 
Steve Johnson would come up the road with a couple of fox dogs 
and dad had about six and he'd 
go down the road, turn 'em loose, 
go down the road and all meet down here, and when you got down to 
the end of Stafford Ave, where Stafford Ave. crosses Parker, that 
had one time, the road you see there now at one time, had been a 
wagon road through the woods, just two wagon roads that took you 
right down onto the meadows, and across Cedar Creek Bridge and 
used for hay, well that hadn't been used for years, so that was 
all 
growed up except for one little path where we used for 
gunning, to start right in gunning there, and now you can't shoot 
a gun within five hundred feet of a house or something, and a dog 
sometimes would start up deer or some of the guys here gun for 
deer the same as they do now, outlaw, and they'd get a deer 
started with their deer dogs and it'd come right down into town, 
swim the lake, 
run down Stafford Ave, go 
in your back yard and 
everything.
