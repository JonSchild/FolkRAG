Entered according to Act of Congress. in the year 1882, by A. J. Fisu E 
Et, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress 
at Washington, D. C. 
Written and sung by FORD & KNOWLES, with great success at 
Tony Pastor's Theatre. 
There are quite a 
number of papers that are printed every 
day, 
And if you'll listen for a 
while, the names we'll give away. 
We'll start, then, with the N. Y. Clipper, it is the boss, you 
bet. 
If you want to read the sporting news that's the one to get. 
Then there is the Herald, the Tribune and the Sun, 
if the Truth was known the Star was printed before the 
World begun. 
But if you want to buy a 
spicy paper, and have no time to, 
lose, 
Tust call a 
boy from off the corner and get the Daily News. 
CHORUS. 
Daily News one cent, mister, won't you buy, 
That's what the newsboys holler, no matter wet or dry. 
It will tell you when the streets will be kept clean, 
And it will drive away the blues, 
It will tell you when the Brooklyn Bridge will be done, 
In the little Daily News. 
Bernhardt and her coffin have arrived, but the news is 
stale, 
For now they say she's stuck upon the editor of the Mail; 
The morning that she landed here, she got awful sick, 
And they made funny pictures of her in the Graphic, Puck 
and Chic. 
The Times says she's a 
darling, so does the Telegram, 
But the Commercial Advertiser says she's nothing but a 
ham; 
Her and Clara Morris went out on a 
spree, and Sarah lost 
her shoes, 
And she went into a 
fit over the racket that she got in the 
Daily News.

Written by BENJ. D. COLLINS. 
Sung by FORD 8: KNowLEe. 
Now, if you'll listen for a 
while 
A funny song I'll sing to you. 
The melody you've heard before 
But the words they are quite new. 
I'll sing of that magnificent thoroughfare 
That is called Sixth Avenue. 
There's young fellows there with curly hair, 
Smoking stubbs of cigars all day, 
Playing pool in the beer saloons, 
And when they get stuck they'll never pay. 
There's Moolihan the policeman 
Drinks five cent whiskey once a 
week, 
They say he ain't much on the run 
But he's terrible on the sneak. 
CHORUS. 
This beautiful place is Sixth Avenue 
With its young girls, too, 
Skipping the tra la loo, 
They live on love and oyster stews, 
On, on, on Sixth Avenue.

SIXTII AVENUE.— CONTINUED. 
There you may go the girls to mash 
At the Haymarket on a 
Sunday night. 
If an Irishman shows his face at the door 
It will wind the dance up in a 
fight. 
There is tough young men 
Who never wear a 
dirty sock, 
Flirt with the girls in the Star and Garter 
While their Benjamin is in hock. 
There are lots of boys that are very choice, 
And also lots of notorious bums, 
Cross-eyed kids with blue eyelids, 
Playing the Mulligan Guards on busted drums. 
The saloons don't trust, if they did they'd bust, 
For lunch they'll give you carpet tacks and glue. 
They tried to set fire to the black Mariar 
Upon Sixth Avenue. 
CHORUS. 
It was discovered in the year of one or two, 
By Cranky Lou from Kalamazoo, 
She drank a 
bottle of blue 
And she quickly took the blues, 
And she christened it Sixth Avenue.

'Twas a 
cold winter's night and the heat was oppressive, 
The rosebuds and the snowflakes covered cabin and stye, 
When Barney flew over the hills to the poor-house, 
And smashed in the window where Katie did lie. 
Saying, Kathleen Mavourneen are you sleeping or eating, 
The landlord has firedme, my coat it is thin; 
Soho, Kathleen Mavourneen, you must let me in. 
(Spoken.) And the young girl turned round, and she said: 
Now, Barney, my bucko, you're giving me taffy, 
Do you mane for to say you have no place to snooze, 
You spent eight thousand dollars at the picnic last Sunday, 
With that red-beaded, fiery-faced Mary Jane Hughes; 
But take this mosquito bar, and this linen duster; 
The night's bitter cold, and you're coat it is thin; 
For what has a 
poor tramp but her feet to defend her, 
No, Barney, my bucko, I'll not let you in. 
(There, now, go home).

-::-
I 
know a 
young fellow he's out on the mash, 
Always in love, but he's never in cash, 
Beats boarding mistresses out of their hash, 
'Will never refuse sherry or sour mash. 
Cnottus: 
His name is O'Brien, he's no friend of mine, 
He ain't got a 
dime and the bootblacks all guy him; 
The ladies are crying, the police are trying, 
To throw Baby Mine or a 
coal mine on Levi O'Brien. 
He is a 
little darling, a 
daisy, you bet, 
lie fell in a 
lake and he did not get wet, 
He is one of the boys that you all read about, 
In the back of the book where the leaves are torn out. 
CHORUS. 
He's got a 
fine mouth for butter, he's knock-kneed and 
stutters, 
He cries skip the gutter, and pull down your shutter; 
This crazy young sucker, he walks on his uppers, 
He hasn't been mayor or found lost Charley Ross. 
Since the Railroads Have Cut Down 
the Fares. 
—:0:— 
Written by DEN MORTON and sung by FORD S: 
KNOWLES, at Harry 
Miner's New Theatre, Bowery, N. Y. 
The railroad monopolists got into a 
row, 
And the people look on at the fight. 
Jay Gould and Vanderbilt put on the gloves, 
And like bull pups they clinch and they bite. 
The Erie is teary, the New York Central is mad, 
Wall Street Bulls stick their horns in the Bears. 
Sammy Tilden got busted and has to work a 
free lunch, 
Since the railroads have cut down the fares. 
As by old Bowery bummers you're braced on the street, 
They'll ask in a 
voice so distressed; 
" 
Please lend me three cents, a 
ticket I'll buy 
For Kalamazoo in the West." 
Jim Blaine and Conkling about it had a 
row, 
They're now in the Tombs for repairs, 
They sent Conkling to Sing Sing for hugging Sprague's 
wife, 
Since the railroads have cut down the fares. 
Old Beecher now preaches while he stands on his bead, 
Yet the Plymouth church girls call him dear. 
Ile and Bob Ingersoll have doubled up, 
And their working oid kegs for stale beer. 
They are using John Kelly's ehromo as a 
poison for rats 
Into fits Mayor Grace now he scares, 
They use Captain Williams for a 
street cleaning broom 
Since the railroads have cut down the fares,

SHANGHIGH ROOSTER'S GRAVE. 
Written by BEN. D. 
COLLINS for FORD 8: KNOWLES. 
0  
I've a 
farm out in the West, it's a 
farm that is the best, 
I've a 
hump-back mule with freckled red hair; 
Then I 
had one Texas steer, with a 
wart on his left ear, 
But he's croaked now and he's climbed the golden stair. 
Then my poor old Shanghigh rooster who in battle nobly 
fell, 
With O'Brien's bull dog lie fought long and brave; 
And the only thing that keeps me from going out and get_ 
ting full, 
is this feather from my Shanghigh rooster's grave. 
CHORUS: 
his eomb was like a 
tooth brush, his spurs were like an ax, 
his tombstone was a 
sugar hogshead stave; 
His wife is out in the barn, sitting on two lumps of coal, 
She is mourning o'er my Shanghigh rooster's grave. 
No more he'll stop out late and come home at half- past 
eight, 
Singing Coe-a-doodle-do or good by Jake; 
No more he'll stop a 
brick that was fired at a 
torn cat, 
Or flirt with Bantams Pullets at the gate. 
He'll never crow again or wink at some old hen, 
lie was a 
masher and his maiden name was Dave; 
MI the hens are on a strike they haven't layed since 
Saturday night, 
For they are weeping o'er my Shanghigh rooster's grave.

YOUR LASSIE WILL BE TRUE. 
Published by permission of and Copyrighted, 1881, by B. W. H ITCH, 
COCK, N. Y. Sung with great success by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
-:0:-
Though seas now divide, and the mountains so wide, 
I'll never once forget you far away; 
But I 
treasure still the flower that you gave me one 
sweet hour, 
When we watched the lads and lasses dancing gay, 
You've longed for my coming, and I've wept bitter 
tears, 
Your Scotch lassie still is your own; 
She never will he false, for her heart she left with you 
No! your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
Oh, laddie, my laddie far away, 
Still would your darling die for you; 
She never will be false, ah, no! no matter what they 
say, 
No, your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
Then, love, don't forget that I 
think of you yet, 
Mid Scotland's bonnie hills across the sea; 
And though i 
far away I 
roam, ah! I 
know there is a 
home 
That is waiting there, my own, for you and me; 
I'll come to you laddie, like the bird to its nest, 
For still I 
am praying for you; 
Of all this world so fair I 
am loving you the best, 
And your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true.

Good Bye Polly. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comive. 
I 
loved a 
gtrl named Polly, and thought that she loved me, 
So joined a 
ship to take a 
trip across the briny sea, 
And when the morning had arrived for me to sail away, 
gave the lass a 
parting kiss, and then to her did say: 
CHORUS. 
Good bye Polly, I 
must leave you, 
Let us hope the parting will not grieve you, 
The ship it sails to-day, some thousand miles away; 
So think of me when I 
am on the sea. 
She vowed that she'd be true to me while I 
was away, 
And thinking what she said was right, I 
left her my half pay ; 
Then with a 
sigh bid her good-bye, and as they heaved the lead, 
I 
left her standing on. the shore, then jumped aboard and said; 
Good bye, Polly, &c. 
I 
saw her in my dreams at night, I 
thought of her all day, 
But did not think that she was false to me, when far away; 
For I 
must own when I 
alone, was lying on my bed, 
I 
often woke up in a 
fright, and these words have said: 
Good bye, Polly, &c. 
Some years had passed when I 
returned, with lots of gold 
in store, 
And just you fancy my surprise, when I 
knocked at the dood• 
They told me Poll was married, she had been false to me, 
So now no more I'll stem 
1i ore, I'm off again to sea. 
Good bye, Polly, &c.

The sheet music of this song can be had or will be sent to any

H. IVEnmAN, 50 Chatham Street. 
Slang phrases come up every day, 
And we hear them on the street, 
But the latest one that I 
have heard, 
To you I 
will repeat; 
On Fifth Avenue Vother day, 
Some young bloods did begin, 
Saying, " Pipe the gal in the blue silk dress, 
And watch me take it in." 
CHORUS: 
Take it in! take it in! 
You bet I'll take it in. 
In churches, gin mills, thro' the town, 
Oh! everywhere we go, 
Among the sports that are known as fast, 
And the straight-laced known as slow; 
011! everyone and everywhere 
They each think it no sin 
To scoop up the thing that they like best, 
And straightway take it in. ( Chorus). 
s.. 
TAKE IT IN.—CorruNtiED. 
Now the people in this world you meet 
Are various and strange; 
There's some that are free as mountain air, 
Whilst others do arrange 
To draw their purse strings tight, 
And slvear they've got no tin, 
Like the jolly old cuss that keeps this house, 
Who always takes it in. ( Chorus). 
Then there are ladies with faces long, 
Would have you think them good— 
How all temptation in this life 
They always have withstood; 
But if you saw their inner self, 
Tho' they look so meek and prim, 
Just give them a 
chance with a 
nice young man, 
How quickly they'll take it in. (Chorus). 
Now before I 
conclude my song, 
There's one thing I 
would name, 
And I 
mention it right publicly, 
Without any fear or shame; 
If any of you boys ask me now 
To a 
seltzer, beer or gin, 
Yhu can bet your own dear, sweetest life, 
This darling takes it in. (Chorus).

HORSESHOES. 
Written by Jerry Cohan expressly for Billy Carter, and 
sung by him with great success. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, 1880. 
Since horseshoes are in fashion why a 
horseshoe song I'll 
sing, 
Its the latest superstition, the most fashionable thing, 
But the only ones ' cept horses who wear them as a 
rule, 
To do them any good must be the jackass or the mule. 
The ladies wear the horseshoe on their fingers,ears and hair, 
The men wear horseshoe pins and canes, it's horseshoe 
everyw here, 
They hang them on the masts at sea to keep away the gales, 
There's horseshoe clocks and bootjacks, horseshoe tracks 
and horseshoe nails. 
They put a 
horseshoe at the gate to keep the witches out, 
Thin people carry a 
horseshoe for luck to make 'em stou t, 
And fat folks keep the horseshoe for luck to make them thin 
Yet the bummer sells the horseshoe to the junkman to get 
The gambler carries the horseshoe his victim for to skin, 
And the victim carries a 
horseshoe to take the gambler in, 
The fisherman carries a 
horseshoe to help him make a 
haul, 
And if he catches only horseshoe fish he has no luck at all. 
They bake the bread in horseshoe pans, and mould the 
butter, too. 
They nail the horseshoe in the trunk to make the old 
clothes new, 
They hang 'em on the church door and for good luck to 
'em pray, 
And the preacher carries a 
horseshoe to keep the girls away 
The temperance man he carries it to protect him from the 
rum, 
And in hopes he may keep always drunk it's treasured by 
the bum, 
If you want to see a 
horseshoe fly just tickle a 
mule and 
get struck. 
I've sung myself quite horse shoe see, so I'll wish ) ou all 
good luck.

Sure I'm a 
high-toned ' ristocrat, 
As you can plainly see; 
I'm known by everybody, 
No matter where I 
may be. 
My influence is wonderful, 
-Whenever I 
take the stand; 
And if you want a 
thoroughbred, 
Why Maloney is the man. 
CIIORUS: 
For Maloney's a 
man, let ye understand, 
Who is well educated and tony; 
ills influence is great, sure he takes the cake, 
There's no such a 
man as Maloney. 
You can see that I'm no lighter, 
And always take things cool; 
But if the boys make fun of me, 
They'll find that I'm no fool. 
I'm up and up with every one, 
There's no better in the land; 
So if you want an honest friend, 
Why Maloney is the wan.

—:

Empty is the bar the dutchman fired the bums, 
The cop is snoring loudly on his beat, 
The lager keg is busted the lunch was all chewed up, 
Except some second- handed old pigs feet; 
The gang has all skedaddled and carried off the plates, 
Others up to sing sing now have flown, 
The rest are in the workhouse where no lager they get, 
For empty is the keg the beer is gone. 
CHORUS. 
Empty is the plates, vanished is the hash, 
The moldy cheese and liverworst has flown, 
The smell of old limburger haunts the place no more 
For empty is the bar the beer is gone. 
They get the dutchman crazy when he goes to sleep, 
He scares the rats around him with his snore, 
He's dreaming of the boys who stood him off for drinks, 
And swears he'll never trust again some more; 
But now the place is busted, the bums are in the park, 
Skirmishing with the sparrows for a 
bed; 
On the bench you heat the call let's have another ball, 
But empty is the bar the dutchman's dead.

Sung with great success by the German emperor, Gus W ILLIAMS. 
l've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
Hut there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever clearly prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my memiry, &c.

Empty Is The Stable, Davy's Gone. 
Written by BEN COLLINS. COPYRIGHTED, 1881, by A. J. FISHER 
Sung with great success by LESTER Lk. W ILLIAMS. 
I 
used to own a 
donkey, a 
1)01)-tail stubborn mule, 
lie was born about the year of '49; 
his head was full of scars from stopping Railroad cars, 
lie was ring-boned, spavined, deaf and blind; 
lie could kick a 
steam engine, and raise you through 
the roof, 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs; 
lie died at half past four, he's gone to that beautifu! 
shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
(Italics: 
Gone to join the angels with spit-curls on his hair, 
Died with epizootic in the head; 
lie might have gone to Congress if he only lived, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
His hoof was like a 
slungshot, he could raise you 
through the roof, 
He'd come into the house and kick you out of bed; 
His feet was full of bunions, he could eat a 
barrel of 
onions, 
And go to sleep a 
standing on his head; 
He'd go to a 
saloon, shove his hoof through a 
spittoon 
And kick the bar into the gutter for a 
joke, 
When he laid down and died, every mule in Jersey died 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
Cnonus: 
Davy's left the stable for the promised laud, 
His overshoes and saddle are in pawn; 
No more hay he'll ever chew, they've turned him into 
glue, 
Empty is the stable Davy's gone.

Fox. 
Sung by Wm. McALoos in all the principal Theatres in America, and 
by O'NEIL & CoNaoy. 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days: 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant has 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
How well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's 01.1vt..

dislike to trust men who hang on to the truth, 
And haven't the nerve to tell lies; 
I 
like to hear a 
man say he killed fifty bears, 
When he knows in his heart they were flies. 
It may not be pleasant to have five thousand dollar? 
Given you by each tramp you meet, 
But it's better to find your mother-in-law drunk 
Than to judge a 
poor girl by her feet. 
CHORUS: 
For I 
do like a 
Tom cat with a 
high tenor voice, 
A Maria that can kick, fight and steal; 
I 
like a 
spitz poodle with all kinds of fleas, 
But I 
don't like a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to see a 
chambermaid in a 
hotel 
Go through every new boarder's trunk, 
I 
like to see a 
preacher on Sunday in church. 
And on Monday in debt or on a 
drunk; 
I 
don't like a 
maiden of sweet sixty-four 
To tell me she's just seventeen, 
But give me the girl from old Boston town 
Who can wrestle with baked pork and beans, 
CHORUS: 
For I 
do like boiled eggs that have seen better days, 
I 
can paralyze all kinds of veal; 
I 
can battle successfully with all kinds of soup, 
But I 
don't care to miss a 
square meal.

:-
Come to Casey's tin pan wedding, 
All the Irish will be there; 
Oh, such howling and such growling, 
And such cutting up so quare; 
All the Cork and Kerry people 
That resides in New York Town; 
Wearing high hats like a 
steeple, 
All the gang will sure be down. 
CHORUS: 
All the Irish will be there, 
Bring along your Bridget fair; 
Make her wear her Sunday hair, 
When in the set she's dancing; 
Won't there be a 
how-de-how, 
When the gang gets in a 
row; 
None but buffaloes will be there, 
At Casey's Tin Pan Wedding. 
There will be ale, stale beer and whisky, 
Goose chowder and cat pie; 
And when Casey he gets tipsy, 
He will slug Riley in the eye; 
Old Pat Shay and Tim Maloney, 
From the town of Donnegal; 
Danced a 
reel for stale bologna, 
On the top of Casey's wall. 
(Chorus).

THE BOSTON BURGLAR.

Sung with great success by DAN MCCARTHY, champion Jig. Reel and 
Clog Dancer of the world, and America's Comic Vocalist. 
Copyrighted, 1881, by HENRY J. AV EHMAN. 
I 
was born in Boston, 
A 
city you all know well; 
Brought Up by honest parents— 
The truth to you I'll tell— 
Brought up by honest parents 
And raised most tenderly, 
'Till I 
became a 
sporting man 
At the age of twenty-three. 
My character was taken 
And I 
was sent to jail; 
My friends found that it was in vain 
To get me out on bail; 
The jury found me guilty, 
The Clerk he wrote it down, 
The Judge then passed my sentence— 
I 
was sent to Charlestown. 
To see my aged father 
A 
standing at the bar, 
Likewise my aged mother 
A 
tearing of her hair— 
The tearing of her old gray locks, 
While the tears came rolling down, 
Savin!r: " Son, dear son, what have you done, 
That you are sent to Charlestown," 
THE BOSTON BURGLAR—CoNTiNuED. 
I 
was put On 
That 
board an eastern train, 
cold December day, 
And every station that we passed, 
I'd hear the people say: 
There goes that Boston burglar, 
in strong chains he'll be bound; 
For some crime or another, 
lie is off to Charlestown. 
There is a 
girl in Boston, 
A 
girl that I 
love well, 
And if ever I 
get my liberty, 
Along with her I'll dwell; 
And if ever I 
get my liberty, 
Bad company I'll shun, 
Likewise night walking, gambling, 
And also drinking rum. 
All you who have your liberty, 
Pray keep it if you can, 
And don't go 'round the streets at night 
To break the laws of man, 
For if you do you'll surely rue, 
And find yourself like me, 
Who am serving out my twenty-one years 
in the penitentiary.

In walking through the streets each day, 
Expressions you will hear; 
And when they come back to your mind, 
No doubt they sound right queer. 
But a 
new one that I 
worked last night, 
I 
surely must relate; 
A 
fellow yelled as I 
passed by, 
Say, old boy, can you skate? 
CHORUS. 
Can you skate? 
No, I 
can't skate, 
But my sister, Kate, can skate; 
Sometimes cuts the figure jaht, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
Can you skate? 
No, I 
can't skate, 
But my sister, Kate, can skate; 
Sometimes cuts the figure eight, 
Well, I 
should ejaculate. 
I 
wandered on a 
little ways, 
Two maidens then I 
met; 
They were so really lovely, 
That those two I 
c:tn' t 
forget. 
Oh, yes, they looked so charming, 
Just like some little tease; 
But imagine my astonishment, 
When one says, can you sneeze? 
CAN YOU SKATE ? —CONTINUED. 
CHORUb 
Can you sneeze? 
No, I 
can sneeze, 
But my sister, Louise, can sneeze; 
Sometimes proves an awful tease, 
When she eats, it's a 
go as you please. 
Can you sneeze? 
No, I 
can't sneeze, 
But my sister, Louise, can sneeze; 
Sometimes proves an awful tease, 
When she eats, it's a 
go as you please. 
To show you how expressions go, 
I 
went to a 
fancy ball; 
And there, you bet, your bottom dollar, 
I 
heard the worst of all. 
A maiden fair, with golden hair, 
Who caught me at a 
glance; 
Walked over to me, and remarked, 
Say, Slobsy, can you dance? 
CHORUS: 
Can you dance? 
No, I 
can't dance, 
But my sister, Nance, can dance; 
Sometimes makes a 
pair of pants, 
For my sister, and my cousins and my aunts. 
Can you dance? No, I 
can't dance, 
But my sister, Nance, can dance; 
Sometimes,makes a

GAUGER PILL- GARLIC. 
(Parody on Major Gilfeather.) 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT for, and sung by Andy CoBoni, the onlj 
Banjo March Player in the world. 
-:
:-
Oh! freckled face Gauger Pill-garlic, 
The bummers and loafers all cry; 
They say use your head for a 
bucket, 
And smother yourself in mince pie; 
They say you're the worst in creation, 
A 
free lunch you'd tackle without fear; 
A 
station house is a 
great recreation. 
And this is the slang you will hear. 
CHORUS: 
A 
sixer for the Gauger Pill-garlic, 
For working a 
servant girl's pocket; 
He thought he'd go off on a 
racket, 
And drink with the money quite free. 
A 
copper nabbed him by the collar 
And said " give that girl every dollar; 
In Sing Sing I'll give you a 
parlor. 
And you can't crack a 
crib any more.' 
The tramp and the political bummer 
has a 
nose that from rum brightly shines; 
And never does hard work ever bother them, 
And they're always complaining of the times. 
With a 
tomato can and a 
stick in their pocket, 
On the watch for new kegs of stale beer; 
Oh! a 
bar-room with a 
fire in the Winter 
Gives a 
gauger a 
jolly old steer. 
6AU lkER PILL-CrARLIC—CONTEIMIN 
CHORUS: 
Then where is the Gauger Pill-garlic, 
His face it would give you the colic; 
I 
think he's gone off on a 
frolic 
With a 
man by the name of Rooney. 
He's drinking champagne in the poor house, 
And feeding on feather weight hash; 
They say he's gone off with Brother Talmage, 
And with Beecher and Elizabeth to mash. 
Oh! jailers and coppers all know him, 
A 
staff once he was on the press; 
Ten cents for a 
ball he does owe me, 
And he gives me a 
puff of his breath. 
He says he is tired of mashing, 
The girl that he had acted queer, 
lie searched for her all over Blackwell's Island. 
And he found her with a 
ball and chain on her ear. 
Citottus: 
Then cheer up old Gauger Pill-garlic, 
Brace up and get full of stale beer, 
Join a 
circus, hire out as a 
toothpick, 
And sit on the sharp edge of a 
spear. 
Dennis Kearney is looking for labor, 
Parnell he's the ladies' fond dear; 
Old Ireland we'll never forget you. 
The country that we love most dear.

Grandmother's Chair. 
Written by JOHN READ, and sung with great success as the latest hit n 
the season at H ARRIGAN & H ART S 
Theatre Comique by EDWIN BARRY 
Music at E.

Copyrighted. 
My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pound•, 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You cari then sit in your old armchair. 
And how they titter'd, &c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life. 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay at home, 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found, 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair? 
And how they titter'd, 8ze.

A 
BUNION THAT I 
FOUND IN 
FATHER'S 
SHOE. 
Parody on Flower from Mother's Grave. 
Written and sung by PAUL DRESSER. 
I've had a 
toothpick at home that I've had for ninety days, 
The one who gave it does a 
song and dance; 
He wears a 
high silk hat, and carries an actor's ten-cent 
cane, 
You can tell him by the fringe that's on his pants, yes, 
at a _glance; 
But there's one sweet, little relic that I 
can never forget, 
And the giver has long since slid up the flue; 
Oh, it is not a 
faded flower, nor a 
brandy smash and sour, 
It's a 
bunion that I 
found in father's shoe; yes, it is true. 
CHORUS: 
Treasured in my memory like a 
free lunch route, 
Is this little story, true it's yet; 
But I 
never can forget when he whistled Olivette, 
And the bunion that I 
found in father's shoe, the wind, 
it blew. 
Now I 
thought it would be best to tell you papa went out 
West, 
The little Indians struck him deaf and dumb; 
lie was not a 
readjuster, yet he'd go upon a 
buster, 
Get full of sherry cobblers and bad rum just like a 
bum; 
lie was formerly a 
sailor, and he sang in Billee Taylor, 
Every word that I 
have spoken friends, is true; 
But he died in Omaha from eating a 
barrel of cold slaw, 
That's where I 
found this little bunion in his shoe; how 
do you do? 
C
HORUS: 
Now my story's almost told, yet a 
tale I 
will unfold, 
Of course, you wish to know what it's about; 
;his is the same old shoe that made Senator Platt feel blue, 
thc on that kicked old Roscoe Qonkling out.

I've a 
daughter Clarabel, 
She's a 
rose-bud rich and rare; 
She wears her brother's derby 
And she bangs her own false hair. 
Her nose is Grxco-Roman, 
Her chromo you can see; 
Just gaze upon the father 
Of sweet Clarabel Magee.

She smashes every swell—Break. 
When she is at a

'Twould break your heart to see, 
How tnashers fight to get a

With Clarabel Magee. 
Oh! she has lots of beauxs, 
There is now a 
bitter strife 
Between Millionaires and Aldermen, 
To get her for a 
wife; 
P,ays she I

Says I

What happy man will win the hand

I'll Bet You a 
Dollar You Don't, 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
Does any one know what I'm going to say ? 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
If I 
lose the wager, will any one pay, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Gay bachelors say they shall never take wives, 
For as each in his way to be happy contrives, 
They mean to keep single the rest of their lives. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
Find an Irish election without any row, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't, 
Or a 
sin l 
who objects to a 
mistletoe bough, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some years of experience teaches me this— 
That from seven to ninety both Mrs. and Miss 
May refuse you this ancient excuse for a 
kiss. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
You may see vaccination a 
thing of the past, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
And heavy taxation abolished at last, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
You may see old John Bull dwindle down to a 
calf 
And his provender nothing but foreigners' chaff. 
You may see all the ladies too quiet by half, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some ignorant croakers wear visages long, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
And say that to visit amusement is wrong, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
Though to succor distress they can never afford, 
Above human vices they always have soared, 
Still somehow they know every move on the board, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
A 
married man often tries to prove cock-o'-the-walk, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar he don't. 
If he tries to sleep when his wife wants to talk, 
I 
shall bet him two dollars he don't. 
So all you young girls, please attend to this verse, 
And go and get married for better or worse, 
And two little armfuls you may have to nurse, 
Won't bet a 
dollar you don't.

THE OLD FASHIONED HOME. 
Parody on Leaving the Old Folks. 
Sang by NED BARRY at H ARRIGAN & H ART'S Theatre Cornique, 
Broadway, New York. 
There's an old fashioned house in the old country, 
There's an old fashioned couple live there; 
There's an old fashioned gate by the old country road 
And an old fashioned man near the chair; 
An old fashioned woman is sitting there. 
Darning an old pair of hose; 
With her old fashioned cap on her old fashioned head 
And she's dressed in her old fashioned clothes. 
CHORUS: 
Hear those bells, those merry bells, 
And they fill my soul with a 
thrill; 
'Tis the old fashioned sound from them old fashioned bells. 
In that old fashioned church on the hill. 
There's an old fashioned clock on that old whitewashed 
wall, 
With its old fashioned pendulum and hands; 
There's an old wooden bench by that old fireplace, 
With its bright copper kettles and pans; 
An old fashioned man is sitting there, 
Smoking his old fashioned clay; 
With his old favorite dog sitting close by his side, 
Watching the children at play. 
Heaven bless that dear old pair, may they live for many 
years, 
In that dear, little house in the lane; 
May they never know a 
care, but all happiness to share 
And think of the dear, old b.appy days; 
The same I 
wish to you, with a 
heart of conscience true 
May you live, yes, for many, many years; 
May you never want for wealth, but enjoy the best of 
health, 
It is the earnest wish I 
give to you. 
Written by BILLY LESTER, and sung by PAUL ALLEN, ESQ. 
I 
am leaving now the Poor-House; to go I 
know not 
where, 
I 
am leaving it in sorrow and disgust; 
I've eight million in my pocket I 
stole from Viola 
Clifton, 
To try and get a 
date I 
know I 
must; 
I've a 
pocketful of gags and encores I 
bought from 
Sarah Bernhardt, 
I've been a 
tramp for over seven years; 
I 
could start a 
penny lodging house under the Fifth 
Avenue Hotel, 
And let people sleep in the drums of my ears. 
CHOItUS: 
Then I 
am leaving now the Poor-House, I 
am trans-
ferred to the Coliseum, 
For trying to guy a 
couple of musical mokes; 
If I

Dialect, 
I'll make them a 
present of John T. Kelly's jokes. 
Adam and Eve, From Lum and Bud Granger were 
with a

They played to eighty cents in Kankakee; 
They done a 
nice big four act with the Arnold 
Brothers from Texas, 
And statue essence with the J 
called Andy McKee 
Hyde & Behman done a 
waltz-jig along with Billy

Poor Paul Allen couldn't dance, his foot was sore; 
But yet he is a

DANCE ME ON YOUR KNEE, 
Sung with gieat success by Miss Minnie Lee 
When I 
was -very young how fond I 
was of childisls joys; 
I 
loved to play among the girls, but better with the noys. 
It was pussy in the corner, tag and ineminie, 
.And when my ma put me in bed I 
would steel out on the 
sly. 
II dared not make the slightest noise when getting back in 
bed, 
The biggest boy would boost me in my window overhead• 
d 
would go to sleep and dream I 
was a 
lady young and 
gay, 
And when my ma would take me up to her I 
used to say. 
CHORUS—.-
Dance me on your knee, mother, dance me on your knee, 
Clasp your arms around my waist, it wont hurt me. 
Hold me tight, don't let me fall, I 
won't be afraid at all, 
Dance me, mother, dance me on your knee.

DANCE M U, ON YOUR KNEE.—Concluded. 
I3ut vs hen I 
wore long dresses first the little boys I 
shook, . 
As my ideas developed the bigger ones I 
took. 
Instead of childish games it was parties, social balls and . 
drives, 
Where'er I 
went I 
had my favorite escort by my side. 
But when I 
tire of one young man, another soon I 
take, 
For there's a 
way of knowing how to give the boys a 
quiet 
shake. 
And when I 
wish to call one back a 
smile would win the 
day— 
I 
need but look upon his face and coaxingly this say: 
Dance me on your knee, &c.. 
I 
want to find a 
lover that will undertake the task, 
And understand just what I 
want, and never have to ask.. 
If such can recommend himself I 
pray don't backward be;. 
But be sure you're brave and strong enough to dance me. 
on your knee. 
There's many a 
wish a 
young girl has she don't like to; 
express, 
There's many a 
time we answer no, and heartily mean 
yes. 
I 
always warn the fellows when we are sitting all alone, 
Be sure don't rumple up my clothes, when you dance me 
on your knee,

MULOAHEY'S COUSIN DAN. 
A Recitation. 
Written for PAT ROONEY hy " Den Morton." 
Copyrighted by A. J. 
FISHER. 188. 
The Half-Breeds and the Stalwarts 
Had a 
rough-and-tumble fight, 
The Half-Breeds had Jim Blaine for a 
leader, 
The Stalwarts said Conklin was right; 
Like Kilkenny cats they fought, 
Like bull- dogs, did growl and grin; 
And though Conklin's friends fought nobly, 
The man from Maine did win. 
Now, I'm neither a 
Half-Breed or Stalwart, 
To no party do I 
belong; 
And though for the spoils they wrangle, 
I 
say both sides were wrong. 
To settle this whole question, 
I 
have an easy plan; 
it is, to make a 
United States' Senator of 
Mulcahey's Cousin Dan. 
If Mulcahey's cousin was Senator, 
He'd make a 
change all round; 
No thieving star route jobbers 
In this country would be found; 
Beecher who says that a 
poor man 
Should live upon water and bread, 
Would have to kiss the Plymouth Church lautes, 
While he stood upon his head.

In the Tombs windy Talmadge, 
Four months, three times a

I 
would play Billee Taylor 
In the tragedy of Olivette. 
I'd then take Susan Anthony, 
And turn her into a 
man; 
If they made a 
United States' Senator of 
Mulcahey's Cousin Dan. 
He'd sweep the stleets of New York with Captain 
He'd then bounce Mayor Grace; 
Nnd make Owney Geoghegan 
Hun the City Hall in his place. 
He'd run the 3d avenue cars to Ireland, 
And steamboats to the skies; 
he'd make bran new electric lights 
Out of the crusts of apple pies. 
He'd make Dennis Kearney president, 
Then the Chinese would have to go: 
Christmas would come in summer, 
On 4th of July we'd have snow. 
The Bulls and Bears of Wall street, 
In the Central Park would stand; 
When we make a 
United States' senator of 
Muicahey's Cousin Dan.

Composed and sung by ANDY COLLOM. 
When I 
was a

I 
used to get a

The old man would take me and lay me cross his lap, 
While he used upon me the old leather strap.

Across his knee so gently 
He'd make me holler murder when he'd— 
Oh! that pain I 
cried in vain, 
Holy Moses General Hickory Jackson how it. 
I 
remember well at school when hooky I 
did play; 
When I 
came home to dinner, there would be the 
deuce to pay; 
Up in the little attic once more he'd make me prance, 
With that old leather strap he wore holes through 
my pants, 
So I 
thought of an idea and I 
soon improved the chance 
Says I 
go it easy pop or you'll bust my Sunday pants. 
"he old man paused a

aloft,. 
Go into the next room Andy and take those breeches cif. 
Then once more he'd make me sore,

Oh! that pain went through my frame,

Copyright, 1878, by HARRISON MILLARD. 
Sung with tremendous success by W. FRED AYKAR, America's 
Greatest Grotesque Clown. 
There it stands in the corner with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall; 
With naught to dist trb it but the duster or broom. 
For no one now tis.m that back parlor room; 
Oh, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and I; 
And we listened to the stories that our grandma would tell 
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so well. 
CHoRUS: 
As —le sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
La I 
we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
If this chair could but speak, oh, the tales it could tell, 
how poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell; 
'Neath the stirs and the stripes he fought bravely and true 
Ile cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue; 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
(Chorus). 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
Her children have followed her, yes, one by one; 
They have all gone to meet her " in the sweet by. 
And all that is left is dear sister and I; 
Never more will we hide her gold specks or her cap, 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stood by the wall.

take you home again, Kathleen, 
Across the ocean wild and wide; 
To where your heart has ever been, 
Since first you were my bonny bride; 
The roses all have left your cheek, 
I've watched them fade away and die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim your loving eyes. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, I 
will take you back, Kathleen, 
To where your heart will feel no pain; 
And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
I 
know you love me, Kathleen, dear, 
Your heart was ever fond and true; 
I 
always feel when you are near, 
That life holds nothing dear but you. 
The smiles that once you gave to me, 
I 
scarcely ever see them now; 
Tho' many, many times I 
see

THE FISHERMAN AND HIS CHILD. 
Sung by Tom DIXON at the San Francisco Minstrels, and made 
Popular by JAMES O'NEIL. 
The fisherman and his child are drowned, 
Came ringing through the town; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around; 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
Oh, God! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk-white sails I 
see. 
(Repeat last 2 
Ononus: 
'Twas the voice of their God that they heard 
As they sank in the deep; 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep, 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
Thy precious soul I'll keep. 
The fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
lie tried to save his child, 
He battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind was howling wild; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
He cried in despair; Thy will be done! 
The child he loved was dead. 
(Repeat 2 
last lines.) 
And when the storms ceased, the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore, 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore, 
Their faces were calm, their bands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life had clasped his child, 
in death they found him there.

last lines.

Parody on Mary Atm. 
Written by PAUL DRESSER, and sung by him with great success. 
A 
new expression that caught me, 
I 
heard it first last night, 
While walking through the busy streets, 
Gazing at the sights; 
A 
friend of mine came passing bye, 
His face with smiles was beaming, 
But I 
saw the twinkle in his eye, 
When he s'sys to me good evening. 
CitoRus: 
Then when this girl would talk to me, 
I 
really felt so clever, 
I 
do not think that two lamp-posts, 
Our plighted love, could sever; 
Have you seen Olivette? not yet, my pet, 
No, no, never; 
Are you going to the ball this evening, baby? 
Well, hardly ever. 
I 
know not what it really meant, 
They were shouting in my ear; 
But everywhere I'd wander, 
This expression I 
would hear; 
But I 
got on when a 
fellow said, 
Are you going to the ball this evening? 
For I 
fell down two flights of stairs, 
For saying not this evening. 
A BOOZER AND A LOSER—CONTINUED. 
The babies on our block got drunk, 
With a 
lot of other coons; 
-My sister, she went on a 
tear, 
With the order of full moons; 
'When Christmas comes, the babies will 
Be banging up their socks; 
:Alothevin-Jaw will go on a 
tear, 
With old grandfather's clock. 
CHORUS: 
Then it's boozer here, boozer there, 
Everywhere it's boozer; 
if you get in among that gang, 
They'll play you till you're a 
loser; 
They'll work you up in elegant style, 
I 
tell you it is true, sir; 
You will find out what it is to be, 
A 
boozer and a 
loser.

PARODY ON SCOTCH LASSIE JEAN. 
Written and sung by PAUL DRESSER. 
In the little town of Ishkosh, not very far from here, 
I 
think its in the State of Kalamazoo; 
Lives my little darling girl, and she works in a 
slaughter 
house, 
Her father and her mother live on glue; 
No matter where I 
roam, I 
hear her singing home-sweet-
home, 
And also when the swallows homeward fly; 
But she paralyzes me, when she sings I 
think of thee, 
She's my cerebro-spinal meningitis Lize. 
CHORUS : 
Oh, Lize, Oh. Lize,you've been eating- custard pie, 
And your breath would kill the angels in the skies; 
Oh, they say you wear false teeth, but I 
think it is untrue, 
You are my web- foot, big- mouthed, knock-kneed, cross-
eyed Lize. 
When first I 
saw your smiling face, you were buying ten 
cent lace, 
e And you also bought a 
bees-wax colored shawl; 
You tried to stand them off a 
week, but you did not have 
the cheek, 
() you went and borrowed your oldest brother's gall; 
You were stuck on Henry Ward Beecher, Roscoe Conkling 
was your teacher, 
A.nd you also smoked a 
five cent cigarette; 
You :Tot a 
dollar for moulding grass, and two cents for 
hot t 
ling, gas, 
And sixty days for whistling Olivette.

PARODY ON SCOTCH LASSIE jEAN—ComiNun. 
Now, there's your brother Jake, he takes the onions and 
the steak, 
Especially when he gets on a 
tear; 
It's then he gets quite frisky, and loads up on five cent 
whiskey, 
Till a 
policeman takes him in his kindly care. 
He is a 
gay deceiver, and he's had the yellow fever, 
lie peddles sandwich life preservers on a 
boat; 
You will see him everywhere, busy crystallizing air, 
For his mother-in-law he'd pawn his overcoat. 
Cnonus: 
Oh, Jane, oh, Jane, I 
will surely go insane, 
If you will only come near me once again; 
Oh, I

Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall; 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all; 
The Politicians promised him work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a

Ah, six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly 
get, 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him 
yet.

They come out like bees in Summer time and sworn for to 
stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cents a 
day,

They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and slush, 
Rut there's one thing in their favor, Italians they never do 
get lush; 
No, they always bring their money home, taste no gin or

A.nd that's one thing I'd like to say of your old man and 
mine.

work, 
‘IcGuiness will go back to his trade, shure he's a

You should see him climb the ladder as nimble as a

Keep your eyes upward, don't let no mortar drop;

There's a 
pretty little maiden, 
That I 
ever shall adore, 
In Italy that bright and sunny land; 
My life would be a 
pleasure, 
I 
would wish for nothing more, 
If she would only share my heart and hand; 
Her father is a 
brigand, 
On a 
lonely mountain pass. 
And with him on the mountain she does dwell; 
There is no titled lady, 
In all Europe can surpass, 
That dear Italian girl I 
love so well. 
CHORUS : 
Though her father is a 
brigand on the mountain, 
She's as gentle as the daughter of an Earl; 
And although she set me free, 
My heart will ever be, 
A captive to that dear Italian girl. 
While roaming lovely valleys, 
'Neath the blue and sunny skies, 
A band of sturdy brigands bold and strong, 
Did capture me, and helpless, 
With a 
bandage o'er my eyes, 
A 
victim, I 
was quickly led along,

THE ITALIAN GIRL.—CoNuNuED. 
Five thousand pounds as ransom, 
They demanded I

But that I

And only for the pleadings 
Of that little mountain maid, 
They would not have permitted me to live. 
(Chorus) 
They put me in a 
dungeon 
Where I 
thought that I 
should die, 
And while the brigand chief with all his band, 
Were plundering poor travelers, 
This lovely girl came nigh, 
In gloomy night and by my side did stand; 
She tore my bands asunder, 
Bade me rise and quickly fly, 
And from her fathers coffers gave me gold; 
And while the tears of love and pity, 
Glistened in her eye, 
The secrets of our hearts were plainly told. 
(Chorus). 
bid her then to fly with me, 
And be my darling bride, 
Although her love for me was plainly shown, 
Her duty she declared, 
Was by her outlawed father's side, 
And so to America I 
returned alone; 
But I 
cannot live forever 
In this free and happy land, 
To Italy I'm going to return, 
To seek with love, and try to win, 
If only for awhile, 
That girl for whom my heart will ever yearn.

We'll put a handsome marble headstone o'er Angel 
Mother's Grave, 
To remind us of the days gone by; 
And we'll have inscribed up,at it our Angel Mother, dear

In the Springtime every year, we will visit that spot so

And ask God to make us strong and brave; 
When wandering from that spot, plant a

I'm George Augustus Clarence Noggs, 
For short they call me Gussy; 
My ma's a

So my linen's never mussy; 
My dress may be eccentric, 
But its quite au faite and right, 
The people stare and admire the air 
Of the little swell in white. 
CHORUS: 
Gussy Noggs with my snow white toggs, 
Look so neat and trimmed and bright; 
The dandies ape the style and shape 
Of the little swell in white. 
I 
do not dress in English style, 
As our would-be dandies do; 
My style is the style of Gussy Noggs, 
And you'll all admit it's new; 
My high bat is always glussy, 
My white trousers are cut tight; 
There's none can imitate the style 
Of the little swell in white.

My togs are neat, my style's complete, 
I'm a 
Regular Army swell, alt.

To waltz with me are crazy; 
At me they smile, they like my style, 
And say that I'm a 
daisy. 
CHORUS:

prance, 
The music's time obeying. 
I

feel, 
So jolly when its playing. 
My whiskers are the pink of style, 
I 
look like Lord Dundreary, 
The pretty girls with giddy curls, 
Say the major is a 
deary. 
Up to my throat, my blue frock coat 
Is buttoned very tightly. 
My legs are thin, my waist is slim, 
But still I'm gay and sprightly. 
I 
am not tall, my cap is small, 
A 
short cane I 
do carry. 
A 
countess yet I'll mash, you bet, 
And then, by ,Jove, 
marry.

For my sweet Made, dear. 
In a 
dry good's store below, 
Juggling silks and calico; 
All the day there she'll stay, 
Wasting her sweet life away. 
Oh, if I 
had gold in store, 
I 
would let her work no more; 
For it's in a 
birdie's cage, 
I'd put my Mattie, dear.

: 
Mrs. Brady, a 
widow lady, 
Has a 
daughter that 1 
adore; 
I 
go to court her, across the water, 
Every Sunday afternoon at four; 
She sings so sweetly, she dresses so neatly. 
So like a 
fairy she trips the floor; 
She's good society, she's full of piety, 
And her mother keeps a 
little candy store. 
CHOR1JS: 
Dainty feet, measured beat, 
Trips the street; oh! so neat; 
Dresses sweet, what a 
treat, 
And her mother keeps a 
candy store; 
Her name is Norah, I 
do adore her, 
She's like an angel, my heart is so sore; 
She's like a 
daisy, she sets me crazy, 
And her mother keeps a 
little cOndy store. 
(Dance). 
Every Sunday, and every Monday, 
With the family I 
go to dine; 
And the daughter, I 
do escort her, 
Every evening till the clock strikes nine; 
One Summer evening, the moon was beaming 
I 
said I 
loved her as dear as life; . 
She blushed completely and smiled so sweetly 
Yet she promised she'd be Kay darling wife.

Written and composed by GEORGE MEEN. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY. His latest hit. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there 
To pass a 
dull hour away; 
We went in you must know, and saw Barnum's show, 
Van Amburgh's menagerie, as well; 
There were round-about swings, and all kinds of things 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
DIALOGUE.—Yes! when we got in the fair, my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride in the swing. I 
said, all right, my 
darling; but directly the swing went a 
little too high, shy 
lustily cried— 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop, 
That was the cry of Maria; 
The more she said whoa, they said, let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said, stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in boats beside us, 
Saying, master don't do such a 
thing; 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knees; 
And one of them said, the young man's getting red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
DieLoouE.—And Maria still cried out at the top of her 
voice— ( Chorus). 
They soon stopped the swing, Maria jumped out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
The girl I 
now do adore; 
Should you ever go there, to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing; 
Of the great round-about, it's the best fun that's out. 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
DIALOGUE.—And when you take a 
girl with you, make 
her promise she won't call out— (Chorus).

An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a

• Or the little bird up in a

But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
CHORUS: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo. 
He played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a

YOU MAY KISS AND CARESS ME. 
As sung by LESTER & W ILLIAM. 
Now Pm going to sing a 
little song, the tune you've heard 
before, 
'Tain't Grimes' cellar door, or love in days of yore; 
You've young fellows slipped upon a 
lean banana core, 
But here is something new; 
I'm in love with Cranky Ann, and I 
asked her for her hand, 
And she gave it to me right across the ear. 
If there's any young girl here would like to treat me to 
some beer, 
I 
will meet her in the bar-room by and by. 
CHORUS: 
You may kiss and caress me and I'll never say no, 
I 
couldn't say no, I 
wouldn't say no; 
Buy me a 
Tom and Jerry, a 
keg of beer or so, 
But don't you tell my sister. 
As you can plainly see, with them we tra la la lee, 
They throw gumdrops at me, and follow me all over the 
town 
Like a 
gang of hungry bees, 
And buy me lemonade and taffy all the day; 
There's one in the gallery, you rascal I 
can see, 
You come here because you couldn't stay away. 
If to kiss me you would try, I 
know that I 
should die, 
And quietly pull down the blind and say: 
CHORUS : 
You may kiss me and caress me and I'll never say nix, 
Oh, come and kiss me quick, I'll strike you with a 
brick; 
You may chew my alabaster ear, I'll never make a 
kick, 
But don't you tell my sister.

If I 
had the power a 
gift to bestow, 
On the friends that around me I 
see, 
I'd give them the very best gift that I 
know, 
The gift that they lucky should be; 
For no matter how clever, how foolish, how wise, 
No matter bow great, or how small; 
By luck more than merit, we fall or we rise, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
CHORUS: 
Here's jolly good luck to us all, my friends, 
The best of good luck to us all; 
For by luck more than merit, we rise or we fall, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
One man may be gifted with talents divine, 
But may still in obscurity live; 
While shallower mortals successfully shine, 
And take all the world has to give; 
One waits on in vain, for good fortune's caress,, 
While the other some chance may befall; 
Which used to advantage results in success, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. (Chorus).. 
So, up and be doing, deserving good luck, 
And good fortune may favor the brave; 
For some of life's prizes are won by sheer pluck 
And are lost by the indolent $14ve; 
There is always one chance in the ilfe of 
Which, if lost, he can never recall; 
So work for it, watch for it, hope if you can, 
That there's jolly good luck for us all. (Chormei,

Folks say we ain't no good 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think we 
should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my aose 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, Cap'en—yes, and a 
good onc, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the nootiest creeter the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux? Why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from near and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers- -none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger—young, handsome, and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
He was the man for Nellie—she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried 0 
stop it, but you know a 
young gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month or after we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
Ill tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes till the Judg-
ment Day.

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
HIIMPTY Dil Pn 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
ft is a P.m simile of a Trick practiced by vti 
the _Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any mrson may become an adept 
, 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic orde; 
has been sent us, called HUMPTY DUALPTY,' and bound 
in such a. way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear. 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap. 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed . 
with the book will make anybody at _home in the hand-) 
ling of it."—Phila.. Evening Bulletin.
