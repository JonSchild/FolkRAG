WE PARTED 
PARTED BY THE RIVER-SIDE. 
We parted by the river-side; 
The moon looked down on you and me, 
The stars put on a 
look of pride, 
The river murmured to the sea: 
The dew-drops kissed the blushing rose, 
The gentle winds did sigh; 
One word broke nature's sweet repose, 
The sad word was: Good-bye! 
CIIORUS. 
Oh! tell me that you love me yet, 
For, oh! the parting gives me pain, 
Say, tell me that you'll not forget, 
For, we may never meet again! 
We parted by the river-side: 
A tear-drop tremblad on your cheek, 
In vain to tell my love I 
tried, 
My heart was sad, I 
could not speak. 
I 
promised that I 
would be true 
So long as I 
wculd live; 
The parting kiss I 
gave to you, 
Was all I 
had to give, 
••.• 
Oh! tell me, &a 
We 
parted by the river-side: 
And I 
have roamed a 
distant clime, 
My heart has not forgot its pride; 
For, I 
have loved you all the time. 
And I 
am faithful to you still, 
While I 
believe you true; 
Afar or near, let come what will, 
I'll love you, you, only you. 
Oh 1 
tell me, &o.

of my life, And causes me such dreadful strife When people say, I'll tell your wife. 
2 I 
never did a 
thing that's wrong, 
-No never once in fun, 
And always go home straight, and tell 
My wife what I 
have done. 
'Twas rather hard, I 
met 
'Ay cousin Jenny Fife, 
And just shook hands, to hear a 
cry, 
" 
Sad man ! I'll tell your wife." 
3 The other night an aged Aunt, 
Dropp'd in to tea with us, 
And when she left, as it was wet, 
I 
saw her to the ' bus: 
She kiss'd me, for affection in 
The dear old girl is rife, 
But the Conductor rudely said, 
" 
Gay dog, I'll tell your wife." 
I'LL TELL YOUR WIFE.—(coxcLuDED) 
Last week my little wife and I 
Went for a 
country walk, 
And when we re:whet-I 
a 
pleasant nook, 
We sat down for a 
talk. 
My arms around. her waist, I 
spoke 
About our wedded life. 
I 
turned and saw a 
gaping crowd, 
Who yelled—" I'll tell your wife !" 
I'll tell your wife, &c. 
I 
hear it in the noisy street, 
And in the quiet square, 
I 
hear its murmur in the shell, 
In short ' tis everywhere. 
That dreadful cry is killing me, 
It's causing fearful strife. 
What, Mr. Jenkins, did you say ? 
He says, ' I'll tell your wife." 
Ill tell your wife, &c. 
• 
HARD TIDIES COME AGAIN NO MORE. 
Let us pause in life's pleasure and count its many tears 
While we all sup sorrow with the poor ; 
There's a 
song that wid linger for ever in our ears— 
" 
Oh I 
Hard 'nines come again no more." 
CHORUS. 
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary; 
" 
Hard Times, Hard Times come again, no more; 
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door, 
Oh, Hard Times come again no more." 
While we seek mirth and music, and music light and gay, 
There are frail forms fainting at the door ; 
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say, 
" 
Oh, Hard Times come again no more." 
'Tis the song, etc. 
There's a 
pile, drooping maiden, who toils her life away, 
With a 
worn heart whose better days are o'er; 
Though her voice would be merry, ' tis sighing all the day— 
" 
Oh, Hard Times come again no more.' 
'Tis the song, etc. 
0111ILEY THE FISHERMAN. 
7 
SWEET SPIRIT HEAR MY PRAYER,. 
As I 
roved out one evening fair, down by the River side, 
f 
heard a 
lovely timid complain, the tears fell from her eyes; 
This is a 
cold and stormy night, those words she then. did say, 
My love is on the raging sea, bound for America. 
My love he was a 
fisherman, his age was scarce eighteen, 
Ile was as nice a 
young man as ever yet was seen ; 
Mv father he had riches great, and Riley he was poor, 
.BL!eause I 
loved this fisherman they could not him endure; 
John O'Rifey was my true love's name, reared near the town of 
Bray, 
My mother took are by the hand and these words to mc did say: 
If you be fond of Riley let him quit this country, 
Your father says he'll take his life, so shun his company. 
0 
mother dear don't be severe, where will you send my love; 
My very heart lies in his breast, as const
ant 
as a 
. dove. 
0 
daughter dear, I'm not severe, here is one thousand pound, 
So send Riley to America to purchase there some ground. 
When Ellen got the money, to Riley she did run, 
Saying, this very night, to take your life, my father charged a 
gull, 
Here is one thousand pound in gold my mother sent to you, 
So sail away to America and 1 
will follow you. 
When Riley got the money next day he sailed away, 
And when he put his foot on board, those words she then did say: 
here is a 
token of true love, and we'll break it now in two; 
You'll have my heart and half may ring, until I'll find out you. 
It was in three months after, as he was waiting by the shore, 
When Riley he came back again to take his love away, 
The ship was wrecked, all hands were lost, her father grieved full 
sore, 
And found Riley in her arms, and they drowned upon the shore. 
lie found a 
letter in her breast, and it was wrote with blood, 
Saving, cruel was my father, that thought to shoot my love. 
So let this be now a 
warning to all fair maids so gay, 
To never lot the lads they love go to America. 
0 thou, to whom this heart no er yet 
Turned in anguish or regret, 
The past forget, the future spare. 
Sweet Spirit, hear my prayer ; 
Oh I 
leave me hot alone in grief. 
Send this blighte ,1 
heart re.ief. 
Send this blighted heart relief. 
Make, thou, my life thy future etre, 
Sweet Spirit, hear my prayer ! 
A 
h, make my life thy future care. 
Sweet Spirit, hear my prayer 
C HO ars. 
Hear, oh, hear my prayer ! 
Oh, hear my prayer! 
Oh thou, to whom my thoughts are known, 
Calm, oh, calm those trembling fears ; 
Oh, turn away the world's cold frown, 
And dry my falling tears. 
Oh, leave ine not alone in grief, 
Send this blighted heart relief, 
Send this blighted heart relief I 
Make thou, my 
life thy future care. 
Sweet Spirit, hear my prayer 1 
Ah, make my life thy future care. 
Sweet Spirit, hear my prayer ! 
Hear, oh, hear, cm.

I WILL STAND BY MY FRIEND. 
As we go on through life's career, 
how many have to rough it ? 
While one gives ns a 
helping hand. 
A dozen try to buffer. 
Still let's he faithful where we can. 
A helping hand to lend; 
My maxim is, that, come what may, 
will stand by my friend ! 
My maxim is, &,c. 
When well to do in life, 
We all a 
ready welcome get; 
It's 
How do you do, to-day, my boy ? 
I'm glad that we have met." 
But, if in our career through life, 
Bad luck does us attend, 
how few will give a 
hand and say, 
I 
will stand by my friend ! 
How few will, ite. 
A friend in need is one indeed ; 
His heart and hand he lends; 
How different where we have to say, 
Oh ! save us from our friends ! 
With many friendship's but a 
name, 
No sympathy they lend, 
They bid good-day, but never say, 
I 
will stand by my friend! 
They bid, Sze. 
NY SISTER DEAR. 
From the Opera of M ASSANIELLO.' 
tly sister, dear, o'er this rude cheek, 
How oft I've felt the tear-drop stealing, 
'When those mute looks have told the feeling 
heaven denied thy tongue to speak, 
And thou badst comfort in that tear 
Shed for thee, my sister, dear. 
But now, alas! I 
weep alone, 
By thee—by joy, by hope forsaken, 
Mid thoughts that darkest fears awaken 
Trembling fer thy fate unknown, 
, 
And vainly flows the bitter tear, 
Shed for thee, my sister, dear. 
SIMPLE SIMON. 
Oh, they call rue Simple Simon, though my name is Simon Snip; 
I 
saved a 
little money, so I 
took a 
little trip. 
Go where I 
will, do what I 
may, it always is the same; 
For without an introductin, people seem 
o 
k 110W my n 
me. 
For they say, Simon ; ( that is w 
hat 
c(ti say to me, 
And judging from your smile, around, what a 
Simon I 
must be 
Olt, may name it seems familiar, and they say with a 
grin, 
And they treat me like a 
Simony for they always take me in. 
Oh, I 
thought that I 
could fancy a 
lady in Br(aewiy, 
I 
don't think it was Nancy, though she tried to do the gay ; 
We went into the country, where she nal& he driver tight, 
When silo too away my nmney 1111(1 the (Inv( r 
wistied to fight; 
And he said, S 
molt, and came a 
rquart g 
up to me : 
Come on, said he, if you're 
man, %% hat a 
Simon 1 
would be I 
He was big enough to eat me, 1 
did not wish to stay, 
For to latten such a 
cannibal, FiO Simon ran away. 
I 
went to Niblo's Garden to see t? e 
White Fawn, 
Win n quickly found that rein my fob my watch was being 
dram, ; 
I 
called Police! they turned me oat for making such a 
noise, 
I 
fancy I 
still hear the yam of all the little boys, 
Saying, Simon ! and did FO - at me. 
For any one to lose a 
watch, it is such a 
jolly spree : 
Titer e 
s 
nothing half so funny as a 
watch and chain to lose; 
Misfortune to a 
little man is sure for to amuse. 
I 
looked in vain ; for I 
could not find the author of the crime, 
I 
found that looking lor toy watch was only losing time. 
I 
said now my poor tick v, ill stop, now my old ticker s 
go e, 
When I 
felt a 
ban t 
upon me drop, and a 
bob by said ; Move on! 
Simon, come, move along! said he, a 
robbery upo ria, beat, 
I 
am sure there cou'd mit t 
be ! 
You simple looking S 
mon, now march I 
I 
sny; 
On every beat that rut upon, all thiev( s 
must run -away. 
I 
cal ed on Mr. , and 1
-e 
gged he'd let me sire., 
When he said : Ah, simple Simon, I 
shall do no uch thing, 
He thought 
y pplication a 
simple bit 0 chaff, 
But I 
ell nod t 
he sit trio ion because I 
made him 
And he said: Simon, these words he said to me. 
If you can only make them laugh, t 
at is all I 
want to 1-ee. 
This is your servant, Simon, t, e 
gratitude I 
feel, 
Words can't express his sentiments, so listen to his heel.!

THINK OF YOUR HEAD IN THE MORNING. 
A IR—" 
Over the Water to Charlie." 
Torn Jennings who never conkl drinking avoid, 
Though vows he was always a 
waking, 
For atter Vaal Witt he was sorely annoyed, 
Witt& IlerVOUSLL'eiS and bead aching. 
Going out to a 
party one evening last week, 
His wife said to hun as a 
warning: 
Now, ec careful, dear few, and mind what you drink, 
And. think of your head in the morning. 
ClIORUS. 
Think, think, think, think, 
Think of your head in the morning. 
Ile promised sincerely to bear it in mind, 
And at dinner at first he was cautious, 
And though very good he the sherry did find, 
lie slpped it as iI 
it were nauseous, 
But wine- will the best resolution destroy, 
And at length he forgot his wife's warning. 
Though he said At each glass, " Tom, be cautious, my boy, 
And think of your neadiu the morning." 
Think, think, &c. 
Whilst during the night be was asked for a 
toast, 
lie gave like a 
man of discerning. 
" 
Here's the friend we can trust, with the girt we 1017E5MM % 
Who will think of our heads in the morning." 
" 
Bravo e' said they, " that's a 
capital say," 
And they drank it with glasses upturning— 
" 
Here's Jennings' sentiment, hip, hip, hurrah," 
Think of their heads in the morning. 
Think, think, &c. 
Whilst steering home, and with drink nearly blind, 
Ile ran against a pump near a 
turning, 
" 
Really," says he, " that's very unkind— 
Think of my head in the morning." 
Then, staggering an, as lie fell in his way, 
Says he, " Sir, you might give me warning," 
As fiat on his bark in the gutter he lay, 
Says he, " Spruce, I 
will look in in the morning 
Spruce, &c. 
With his head swimming round, as he lay on the ground. 
Think of his head in the morning, 
The police coming round, quickly him found, 
Repenting, and groaning and yawning.

SALLY COME UP. 
Massa's gone to town the news to hear, 
And he has left de overseer 
To lo,)k to all the ni2gers here, 
While I 
make love to Sally. 
She's such a 
belle, 
A real dark swell, 
She dresses so slick and looks so well, 
Dar's not a 
gal like Sally I 
CHORUS. 
Sally come up! Oh, Sally go down! 
Sally, come twist 
our heel around; 
De old man he's gone down to town, 
Oh, Sally, come down de middle. 
Last Monday night I 
gave a 
ball, 
And I 
invite the niggers all, 
The thick, the thin, the short, the tall, 
But none can come up to Sally I 
And at de ball 
She did lick 'em all; 
Black Sal was de fairest gal ob all— 
My lubly, charming Sally. 
Sally come up, &o. 
D • fiddle was played by Pompey Jones, 
Uncle Ned he shook de bones, 
Joe played on de pine-stick stones, 
But dey couldn't play to Sally 
She's got a 
foot 
To fill out the boot, 
So broad, so long, as a 
gum tree root, 
Such a 
foot has Sally! 
Sally come up, tte. 
Sally has got a 
lubly nose, 
Flat across her face it grows, 
It sounds like thunder when it blows, 
Such a 
lubly nose has Sally ! 
She can smell a 
rat, 
So mind what you're at; 
Its racier sharp, aldou ,h 
it's fiat, 
Is de lubly nose ob Sally! 
Sally come up, &c. 
Be oder night I 
said to she, 
I'll bah you, if you'll hah me. 
" 
All right," says she. " I 
do agree :"

She's rider dark, 
But quite up to de mark; 
Neber was such a 
girl for a 
lark, 
Such a 
clipper girl 1

SHAN'T I 
BE GLAD WHEN SALLY COXES HOME. 
Oh I 
I've been so sad for a 
very long time, 
I 
thought I'd lost that girl of mine, 
Who really is an angel divine, 
And I 
have her absence been mourning. 
Oh, yes throw."' her I've been made very ill. 
To her ' twas a 
trouble to keep her band still, 
Through which she got six months on the treadmill, 
But she's coming out in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! shan't I 
be glad when Sally comes home ! 
When Sally comes home, when Sally comes home 
Shan't I 
be glad when Sally comes home! 
For she's coining out in the morning 
Now Sally she is a 
young feminine fair, 
She was to me beyond compare, 
I 
much admire her carroty hair, 
For she scorns the use of a 
chignon. 
Her father sold baked tarts in a 
tin can, 
Her brother he was a 
fat six foot policeman, 
Her mother worked bard at the tub, pail and pan, 
And gained every one's good opinion. 
Oh I 
shan't I 
be glad, &c. 
Now Sally she was her mamma's fondest pet, 
But unluckily, one day she met. 
A 
friend of hers, called " light-fingered Bet," 
A 
girl much addicted to cheating. 
They walked in a 
large draper's shop one fine day 
To buy some smart ribbons and flowers so gay, 
When Sally was seen walking quickly away 
"With twenty-four yards of white sheeting. 
Oh I 
shan't I 
be glad, Szo 
The shopman on her all the time had his eye, 
And called a 
bobby then standing by. 
Though Sarah she for mercy did cry, 
He soon walked her off to the station. 
They took her before the Judge on that day, 
A 
most shocking bad case it was, he did say, 
So for six long months be sect Sally away,' 
To be boarded and lodged by tiltat I b 
the nation. 
oi 
)I I 
e glad,ft 
But courage and strength I'll endeavor to show, 
And set aside all sio.us of woe, 
From gaol . to church we quickly will go, 
When they let her to out in the morning. 
And when charmino- Sally becomes my dear wife, 
We'll soon put an end to all trouble and strife, 
And, happily leadino• a 
good honest life, 
We'll set an example and warning. 
Oh 
shan't I 
be glad, &

SEVENTY-TWO.— [CoNcLuDnD.] 
In the red bricled hall, with moss covered wall, 
Where my father he lived and died, 
I 
live at my ease, and do as I 
please. 
Caring nought for the world so wide— 
The pluck of a 
lion, a 
muscle of iron, 
fr 
And a 
heart that is honest and true, 
Yet a 
heart that can always for others feel 
Altho' I'm Seventy-Two. 
Then cheer, boys, cheer, &c. 
No sluvard am I, in my bed to lie, 
I 
rise at early dawn. 
Thro' meadows I 
jog, with my gun and my dog, 
Or mount at the sound of the horn. 
A 
seat in the saddle I 
still can keep, 
With a 
heigh, Tally ho, halloo! 
For my limbs are strong, and my wind is long, 
Altho' I 
am Seventy-Two. 
Then cheer, boys, cheer, &c. 
At Christmas time, when the bells they chime, 
I've a welcome as well as a 
smile. 
And hearty good cheer for peasant or peer, 
In a 
jolly old English style. 
I'm fond of good sport, yet, nevertheless, 
My passions I 
always subdue, 
For it's only a 
fool that loves excess, 
And will never reach Seventy-Two. 
Then cheer, boys, cheer, &c. 
YES OR NO. 
A 
smile now gathers round thy lip, 
But not a 
word or sigh 
Escapes to tell it* l'm beloved, 
Or bid sad doubts to fly. 
I 
sue to thee, no crimson cheek, 
Reveals love's burning glow, 
Have pity on my throbbing heart, 
Say Yes, my love, or No.

WHILE THE DAYS ARE GOING BY.

I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY 'DO IT, BUT 
THEY DO. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by _
H ARRISON M ILLARD. 
There are lonely hearts to cherish 
While the days are going by ; 
There are weary souls who perish, 
While the days are going by; 
If a 
smile we can renew, 
As our journey we pursue, 
0! the good. we all may do 
While the days are going by. 
CHORUS. 
While the days are going by, 
While the days are going by; 
All may find a 
field of toil, 
While the days are going by. 
There's no time for idle scorning, 
While the days are going by; 
Let Your face be like the morning, 
While the days are going by; 
0! the world is full of sighs, 
Full of sad and weeping sighs; 
Help your fallen brother rise, 
While the days are going by. 
While the days are going by, &c. 
All the loving links that bind us, 
While the days are going by, 
One by one we leave behind us, 
While t'.e days are going by; 
But. the seeds of good we sow, 
Both in shade and. shine will grow, 
And will keep our hearts aglow, 
While the days are going by. 
While the days are going by, &c.

music by H ENRI' TECIKUR. 
As I 
look round. about, my head is in a 
whirl, 
I 
see the world so greatly changed since I 
was but a 
girl; 
Old notions out of date they're all made over new— 
And yet, l'm sure, I 
don't know how they do it, but they do. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! times are changed about, and everything is new, 
I 
don't know how they do it quite, and yet I 
know they do; 
Yes, times are changed about, and everything is new— 
I 
don't know how they do it quite, and yet I 
know they do. 
Men used to live upon what honestly they made, 
But now they rather seem to live upon their debts unpaid ; 
In style they swell about their creditors in view— 
It puzzles me, I 
don't know how they do it, but they do. 
Oh I 
times are changed, Ltc. 
Once on a 
time young men were steady and upright, 
In " sporting" now they spend their time, and in it take 
delight; 
They drive about fast teams, on governor's money, too— 
It shocks me quite, I 
don't know how they do it, but-they do. 
Oh! times are changed, &c. 
Young ladies now are not like those I 
used to know, 
When I 
was young we waited till sought after by a 
beau ; 
But now things are reversed, they're going all askew— 
The girls propose ! I 
don't know how they do it, but they do. 
Oh I 
times are changed, & c.

I'LL HANG MY HARP ON A WILLOW TREE. 
Words by T. rievviES BAYLV. 
I'LL hang my harp on a 
willow tree, 
off to the wars again ; 
My peaceful home has no charms for me, 
The battle-field no pain. 
The lady I 
love will soon be a 
bride, 
With a 
diadem on her brow, 
Oh why did she flatter my boyish pride ? 
She's going to leave me now. 
She took me away from my warlike lord, 
And gave me a 
silken suit, 
I 
thought no more of my master's sword, 
When I 
played on my master's lute, 
She seemed to think me a 
boy above, 
Her pages of low degree, 
Ohl had I 
but loved with a 
boyish love, 
It would have been better for me. 
Then I'll hide in my breast every selfish care, 
I'll flush my pale cheek with wine, 
When smiles awake the bridal pair, 
I'll hasten to give them mine. 
I'll laugh and I'll sing, though my heart may bleed, 
And I'll walk in the festive train ; 
And if I 
survive it I'll mount my steed, 
And off to the wars again. 
• 
But one golden tress of her hair I'll twine, 
In my helmet's sable plume, 
And then, on the field of Palestine, 
I'll seek an early doom : 
And if by the Saracen's hand I 
fall, 
'Mid the noble and the brave, 
A 
tear from my lady-love is all, 
I 
ask for the warrior s'grave. 
Mueic by W. GIIRRNSEY. 
THE GREEN LITTLE SHAMROCK 
There's a 
dear little plant that grows in our isle, 
'Twas St. Patrick himself, sure, that set it, 
And. the sun on his labor with pleasure did smile, 
And with dews from his eyes oft did wet it. 
It thrives through the bog, through the brake, through 
the mireland, 
And be called it the dear little shamrock of Ireland. 
CHORUS. 
The sweet little shamrock, the dear little shamrock, 
The sweet little, green little shamrock of Ireland. 
This dear little plant still grows in our land, 
Fresh and fair as the daughters of Erin, 
Whose smiles can bewitch, whose voice can command 
- 
In each climate that each shall appear in, 
And shine through the bog, through the brake, through 
the mireland, 
Just like their own dear little shamrock of Ireland. 
The sweet little shamrock, &c. 
This dear little plant that springs from our soil, 
When its three little leaves are extended, 
Denotes from one stalk we together should toil, 
And ourselves by ourselves be befriended. 
And still through the bog, through the brake, through 
the mireland, 
From one root should branch the shamrock of Ireland. 
The sweet little shamrock, &c.

BLACK-EYED SUSAN. 
All in the Downs the fleet was moor'd, 
The streamers waving in the wind, 
When black-eyed Susan came on board, 
" 
Oh, where shall I 
my true love find ? 
Tell me, ye jovial sailors true, 
If my sweet William sails among your crew." 
William, who, high up,,n 
the yard, 
Rocked by the billows to and fro, 
Soon a.: her well-known voice he heard, 
lie s'glied, and cast his eyes below; 
The rope slides quickly through his glowing hands, 
And quick as lightning on the deck he stands. 
" 
Oh ! Susan, Susan, lovely dear, 
3Iy vows shall ever true remain ; 
Let me kiss off that falling tear, 
We only part to meet again. 
Change as ye list, ye winds, my heart shall be 
The faithful compass that still points to thee. 
Believe not what the landsmen say, 
'Who tempt with doubts thy constant mind; 
They tell thee sailors when away, 
In every port a 
mistress find. 
Yes— yes, believe them when they tell thee so, 
For thou art present wheresoe'er I 
go. 
If to fair India's coast we sail, 
Thine eyes are seen in diamonds bright, 
Thy breath in Afric's spicy gale, 
Thy skin is ivory so white. 
Thus, every beauteous object that I 
view 
Wakes in my soul some charm-; of lovely Sue. 
Though battle calls me from thy arms, 
Let not my pretty Susan mourn ; 
Though cannons roar. vet, safe from harm, 
William shall to his dear return ; 
Love turns aside tho bills that round me Hy, 
Lest precious tears should drop from Susan's eye." 
The boatswain gave the dreadful word, 
The sails their swelline• bosoms spread, 
No lon<rer must she st iv on board ; 
They kissod—she sirhed. he hung his head; 
A 
lowered boat unwilling rows to land, 
" 
Adieu," he cries, she waves her lily hand. 
I'm the lad that's free and easy, 
Wheresoever I 
chance to be, 
And I'll do the best to please ye, 
If you will but list to me. 
CHORUS. 
So let the world jog along as it will, 
I'll be free and easy still. 
Free and easy, free and easy, 
I'll be free and easy still. 
Some there are who meet their troubles, 
Other drown their care in drink, 
All one's trials are but bubbles, 
Fretting forges many a 
link. 
So let the world, &c. 
I 
envy neither great nor wealthy, 
Poverty I'll ne'er despise, 
Let me be contented, healthy, 
And the boon I'll dearly prize 
So let the world, & c. 
The great have cares I 
little know of, 
All that glitters is not gold, 
Merit is made a 
show of, 
And true worth is rarely bold. 
So let the world, &c. 
Why then waste our time in fretting, 
The longest lane must have end. 
It strives hard in getting, 
Stores for fools and knaves to spend. 
So let the world, & c. 
I 
care for all, yet for no man. 
Those who mean well should not fear, 
I 
like a 
man, and love a 
woman, 
What else makes this life so dear. 
So let the world,

THE MUSIC MASTER. 
She was called a 
coquette at the ball in the west, 
But what did she care for that ? 
The man wasn't there that she loved best, 
So she didn't mind what she was at. 
She thought, though I 
flirt here as much as I 
can, 
And go on in a 
terrible manner, 
My heart is at home with that dashing young man, 
Who teaches me to play the piano. 
CHORUS. 
With his two-four, three-four, six-eight time, 
And play the passage faster ; 
F, A, C, E, G, B, D, 
She loved her music master. 
She feared her papa'd be a 
bar to her hopes, 
For he wanted her tied to a 
lord ; 
And she eloped down a 
ladder of ropes, 
Her musician supplying the chord ; 
For she was too sharp to be wed to a 
fiat, 
And escaped in a 
natural manner ; 
And it isn't a 
gmr on her lovier that 
He's a 
teacher upon the piano. 
With his two-four, &c. 
And now they are married, he's not too much cash, 
But she don't note that minor offence, 
For he'll get her fortune and then cut a 
dash, 
At her father, the major's, expense. 
But one thing he wanted that wasn't quite fair, 
And yet frotn his wish he may waver ; 
Tho : when she refused him a 
key he did swear, 
And muttered a 
demme-solni-quaver. 
With his two-four,Ac. 
She has bought him a 
Broad wood's mahogany grand, 
On which when at home, he will play, 
For since he's possessed of an heiress's hand, 
He'll teach no more from to- day. 
And doctor of music he shortly may be, 
Because though in vain he might try it, 
To get honor by talent, between you and me, 
Ao he's money, he's only to buy it. 
With his two-four, & c. 
TAPIOCA. 
When I 
used to work on the levee, 
Many happy darkies there you see; 
Cotton coming in so very heavy, 
Oh, golly, there was lots of work for me. 
Black man hauling in de cargo, 
Sun am very hot upon de head; 
'When he done, he dance a 
jolly jargo, 
Rum, turn, turn, on de banjo, and to bed. 
CHORUS. 
To my oakum, to my oakum, 
Oh, Pompey, can't you pick a 
peck of oakum? 
Oh, ah, ah, jolly, ain't de levee nigger free! 
Working on de cotton boat, ten shillings a-day, 
Johnny, can't you pick upon de banjo? 
Oh me, oh my, mammy, mammy, mammy, 
Don't you hear de baby cry ? 
When I

Totin wood and water all de day, 
Chilly wind lie came and make me shiver, 
Oh, glad dis child he was to get away.

ADAM'S ALE.

26 
THE GRAVE OF BONAPARTE. 
On a 
lone barren isle, where the wild roaring billows, 
Assal,l the stern rock, and the loud tempests rave, 
The hero lies still, while the dew-drooping willows, 
Like fond weeping mourners lean over the grave. 
The lightnings may flash and the loud thunders rattle, 
Ile heeds not, he hears not, he's free from all pain; 
He sleeps his last sleep, he has fought his last battle, 
No sound can awake him to glory again— 
No sound can awake him to glory again. 
Yet, spirit immortal, the tomb cannot bind thee, 
For like thine own eagle that soared to the sun, 
Thou spring,est from bondage, and leav'st behind thee 
A name, which before thee no mortal had won. 
Though nations may combat, and war's thunders rattle, 
No more on thy steed wilt thou sweep o'er the plain ; 
Thou rleep'st thy last sleep, thou hast fought thy last battle, 
No sound can awake thee to glory again— 
No sound can awake thee to glory again 
Oh, shade of the mighty, where now are the legions, 
That rushed but to conquer when thou led'st them on? 
Alas they have perished in far chilly regions, 
And all save the fame of their triumph is gone. 
The trumpet may sound, and the loud caution rattle, 
They heed not, they hear not, they're free from all pain: 
They sleep their last sleep, they have fought their last battle, 
No sound can awake them to glory again— 
No sound can awake them to glory again. 
A 
glass of cold water I'll drink when I 
am thirst; 
My lungs it will cool, and in 
spirils will cheer ; 
It makes me feel joyful, so healthy and happy ! 
Then, till up the pitcher, and hand it round here. 
Away with your rum. punch, wine, beer, and cider, 
Your gin, rum, and brandy will send you to jail 
Conic all yoll old drunkards, and join the Tea-tot allers, 
And you'll have an abundance of Adam's good Ale. 
Contented I 
watch, and contented I 
study; 
Contented I 
pray, and contented I 
sing; 
I 
ne er made a 
practice of drinking hot toddy, 
For that is a 
vain and ungodly thing. 
For they that drink of it are poor wretched creatures; 
With hunger their poor little children bewail ! 
Oh ! come, drunken parents, provide for your family, 
And join the blest baud that drinks Adam's guod Ale. 
The drunkard's a 
thief, a 
liar, and swearer, 
A robber, and murderer of his own soul; 
He starves and abuses and beggars his family; 
lie makes them go ragged, and filthy, and cold 
A robber of God, a 
seducer of neighbor, 
A 
spoiler of Zion and her happy vale; 
Ye poor, wretched creatures, come, give up your folly. 
And join the blest band that drinks Adam's good Ale. 
The drunkard works hard, and he gives his week's wages 
To furnish the landlord with every tine thing; 
Fine beds and fine carpets, and grand, splendid parlor, 
A watch in his pocket, and jewels and rings, 
A sumptuous living, and excellent clothing; 
his wife dressed in silks, her gold rings, bat and veil ; 
Look round you, poor drunkard, examine your conduct, 
And, now, make a 
trial of Adam's good Ale. 
This Ale is so cheering, refreshing, and cleansing! 
It makes the whole world rich, healthy and gay; 
it watered bright Eden, and Adam enjoyed it, 
Before he transgressed or corrupted his way. 
Not one single blessing on this side of Jordan, 
More free, meet, or plenteous tot' man's happy va.e; 
It's granted in showers, sent down by the Powers 
Of Heaven, the Brewer of Adam's good Ale I

ANNIE, WE HAVE PARTED. 
AIR—" Willie, We Have Missed You." 
Oh! Annie, we have parted, my happy dream is o'er; 
I 
leave thee broken-hearted, to meet perchance no more. 
The world looks not so bright, love, as once it did to me: 
'Tis shrouded now in night, love, for I 
am leaving thee; 
And yet your voice seems sweeter, your song is still as glad; 
Oh! Annie, we have parted, and now my heart is sad. 
I 
never can forget thee, though years may pass away, 
The time when first I 
met thee, a 
lovely summer's day; 
The vows that once were spoken, upon that summer's eve, 
Shall they remain unbroken, can my poor heart believe? 
But you say that we have parted, and my every thought is vain; 
Oh Annie, we have parted, and ne'er shall meet again. 
The hopes that I 
would cherish, I'll banish from my heart, 
I'll let each fond dream perish, since you and I 
must part; 
The hours once filled with gladness are fraught with sorrow now. 
My heart is sick with sadness, 'tis marked upon my brow; 
I 
leave thee in thy beauty, and yet 'tis sad, with pain; 
Oh! Annie, we have parted, and ne'er shall meet again. 
• 
Oh! Annie, we have parted, and I 
again must find 
Another more true hearted, one gentle and more kind; 
And when afar I 
roam, love, across the trackless sea, 
Far from my native home, love, I'll still remember thee; 
And each fond thought will linger around my weary heart: 
Oh! Annie, I 
have loved thee, 'tis sadness now to part. 
THE OLD FARM GATE. 
Where, oh 1 
where is the gate that once served to divide 
The elm-shaded lane from the dusty road-side ? 
I 
like not this gate, so gay and bedight, 
With its glittering latch, and trellis of white; 
It is pretty, I 
own, but oh ! dearer by far, 
Is the red rusted hinge, and the weather warped bar • 
Here are fashion and form of a 
modernized date, 
But I'd rather have looked on that Old Farm Gate. 
It was here where my sisters would gather to play, 
In the shadows of twilight, or sunny mid-day; 
How they laughed, and ran wild mid those hillocks of sand, 
Temptation existing—no child could withstand— 
To swing on the gate rails, to clamber and ride, 
Was the utmost of pleasure, of glory and pride. 
No car of the victor, or carriage of state, 
Ever bore such light hearts as that Old Farm Gate. 
Fair, fair is the barrier now taking its place, 
But it darkens a 
picture my soul longs to trace; 
I 
sigh to behold the rough staple and hasp, 
And the rails that my glowing hands scarcely could clasp. 
Oh how the warm spirit begrudges to part 
With the commonest relic, once linked to the heart; 
And the brightest of fortunes, the kindness of fate, 
Would not banish my love for that Old Farm Gate.

DOROTHY DREW, OR THE CALICO-PRINTER'S 
CLERK. 
Ant :—The Irish Volunteer. 
In Manchester, that cit v 
of cotton, twist, and twills, 
Lived the subject of my ditty, and the cause of all my ills. 
She was handsome, young, and twenty ; her eyes were azure 
blue; 
Admirers she had plenty, and her name was Dorothy Drew-
CHORUS. 
She was very fond of dancing, 
But allow me to remark 
That, one fine day, she danced away, 
With a 
Calico- Printer's Clerk. 
At a 
private ball I 
met her, in Eighteen- Sixty Three 
I 
never can forget her, tho' she was unkind to me; 
I 
was dressed in the pink of fashion, my lavender gloves w 
new: 
I 
danced the valse Circassian with charming Ddrothy Drew. 
She was very fond of dancing, & c. 
We Schottisch'd and we Polka'd, to the strains the band did 
PlaY; 
We Valsed and we Mazourktid, till she valsed my heart away; 
I 
whispered, in this manner, as round the room we flew, 
Doing Var-so-vi-a-na: I 
love you, Dorothy Drew. 
She was very fond of dancing, & c.I 
For months and months, attention unto her I 
did pay, 
Till with her condescension she led me quite astray; 
The money I 
expended, I'm ashamed to tell to you; 
I'll inform you how it ended \with myself and Dorothy Drew. 
She was very fond of dancing, & c. 
I 
received an intimation she a 
visit meant to pay, 
Unto a 
near relation, who lived some miles away; 
In a 
month she'd be returning, I 
must take a 
short Adieu, 
But her love for me was burning, deceitful DorothS' , Drew. 
She was very fond of dancing, &c. 
At nine o'clock next morning, to breakfast I 
sat down; 
The smile, my face adorning, was soon changed to a 
frown 
For, in a 
morning paper, a 
paragraph met my view; 
That Junes, a 
Calico-Printer's Clerk, had married Miss Dorothy 
Drew. 
She was very fond of dancing, & c. 
HAVE YOU SEEN HER LATELY ? 
I 
stand before you, bathed in tears, 
My heart with anguish panting,; 
I 
once was fat, but now I'm thin, 
Without the aid of Banting; 
The reason is, I've lost my love 
No damsel could be fairer ; 
Her form was slight, of medium height, 
And her maiden namA was Sarah. 
CHORUS. 
She went away a 
month to-day; 
Her absence grieves me greatly: 
She'd a 
strawberry mark -upon her arm; 
Oh ! have you seen her lately ? 
She's cheeks like lilies, eyes like sloes, 
And fingers long and taper; 
Her hair is red to match her nose, 
And mostly worn in paper. 
I 
cannot guess, upon my life I 
What she has gone away for; 
She's taken ey'ry stick away, 
That I 
have had to pay for. 
She went away, Ltc. 
She has my watch. 
I 
lent it her; 
It was a 
gold Geneva; 
I 
never thought, till now, that watch 
Would prove to be a 
lever. 
I've sought her East, I've sought her West, 
And done my best to find her; 
This little note, address'd to me, 
is all she's left behind her: 
She went away, & c. 
"My dearest Sammy, [that means me.] 
I 
shan't be long away, dear, 
I've gone to stay at Rockaway; 
So, don't be anxious, pray, dear. 
Your watch I 
left at Simpson's, love; 
The name I 
gave was Cricket; 
But keep your spirits up, old boy, 
For 1 
here enclose the ticket." 
She went away, & e. 
l've been, to-day, to Rockaway, 
And searched it through and through, sir; 
I 
ask'd and ask'd, yet, strange to say 
No one my Sarah knew, sir; 
But she, of course, will soon come back, 
My lot to be a 
sharer; 
And when she does, if you'll come here, 
I'll introduce my Sarah. 
She went away, (ix.

LATHER AND SHAVE. 
It was in this city not far from this spot, 
Where a 
barber he opened a 
snug little shop, 
lie was silent and sad but his smile was so sweet; 
That he pulled every body out of the street. 
CHORUS. 
With his lather and shave 'em, lather and shave 'em, 
Lather and shave 'ern, frizzle 'em bum. 
One horrid bad custom he thought he would stop, 
That no one for credit should come to his shop, 
So he got him a 
razor full of notches and rust, 
To shave the poor devils who came there for trust. 
With his lather and shave, &ie. 
One day a 
poor Irishman passed by that way, 
Whose beard had been growing for many a 
day; 
lie looked at the barber and put down his hod. 
Will you trust me a 
shave for the pure love of Gpd! 
With his lather and shave, (4.:c. 
Walk in, says the barber, sit down on that chair, 
I'll soon mow your beard off right down to a 
hair. 
So his lather he spread over Paddy's big chin, 
And with his trust razor to shave did begin. 
With his lather and shave, (ke. 
Och murther, says Paddy, now what are you doing, 
Leave off wid your tricks or me jaws you will ruin. 
Faith now how would you like to be shaved with a 
saw ; 
Be the powers you'll pull every tooth out o' me jaw. 
With his lather and shave, die. 
Still, still, says the barber, and dont make a 
din; 
With moving your jaws I'll be cutting your chin. 
Not cut but sawed, Och that razor you've got, 
Sure it wouldn't cut butter if it wasn't made hot. 
With his lather and shave, ci:e. 
Now lavo off yer tricks and don't shave any more, 
And Paddy he bolted straight out of the door. 
Crying ye may lather and shave all yer friends till yer sick, 
But be Jabers I'd rather be shaved with a 
brick. 
With your lather and shave, dic. 
Not long after that Pat was passing the door, 
When a 
jackass he set up a 
terrible roar. 
Och murther, says Paddy, just list to yon knave, 
He's givin some poor devil a-love-a'-God shave.

THE DYING CALIFORNIAN. 
Hearken to me, brother, hearken ! I've something I 
would say, 
Ere the veil my vision darkens, and I 
go from earth away. 
I 
am dying, brother, dying ; soon you'll miss me from your berth, 
And my form will soon be lying 'neath the Ocean's briny surf. 
Lay up nearer, brother, nearer, for my limbs are getting cold, 
And thy presence seemeth dearer when thine arms around me fold. 
I 
am going, brother, g(Lng, yet my hope in God is strong; 
I 
am willing, brother, knowing that he doeth nothing wrong. 
Tell my father, when you greet him, that in death I 
prayed for 
him; 
Prayed that I 
might, one day, meet him in a 
world that's free from 
sin. 
Tell my mother, God will help her now that she is growing old; 
Say her child did yearn to kiss her when his lips grew pale and 
cold. 
Listen, brother; catch each whisper; 'tis my wife I'd speak of now ; 
Tell, oh ! tell her how I 
missed her, when the fever burned my 
brow. 
Tell her—brother, closely listen; don't forget a 
single word; 
That, in death my eyes did glisten with the tears her memory 
stirred. 
Tell her, she must kiss my children, like the kiss I 
last impressed; 
hold them as when last I 
held them, folded closely to my breast; 
Give them early to their Maker, putting all their trust in God, 
And he never will forsake her, for He says so in His Word. 
Oh ! my children—Heaven bless them! they were all my life to 
me! 
Would I 
could once more caress them, ere I 
sink into the sea. 
'Twas for them I 
crossed the ocean, what my hopes were, I'll not 
tell; 
For they've gained an orphan's portion, yet He doeth all things 
well. 
Tell my sisters I 
remember every kindly parting word; 
And my heart has been kept tender by the thoughts their memory 
stirred. 
Tell them I 
never reached the haven where I 
sought the precious 
dust; 
But I've gained a 
port called Heaven, where the gold will never 
rust. 
Tell them to secure an entrance, for they will find their brother 
there; 
Faith in Jesus and repentance will secure for each a 
share. 
Hark! I 
hear my Jesus speaking; 'tis His voice I 
know so well. 
When I'm gone, oh! don t 
be weeping; brother, here's my last 
farewell ! 
36 
JOE BOWERS. 
My name is Joe Bowers, I've got a 
brother Ike, 
I 
came from oh l 
Missouri, all the way from Pike; 
I'll tell you why I 
left thar, and why I 
came to roam, 
And leave my poor old mammy, so far away from home. 
I 
used to court a 
gal there, her name was Sally Black, 
I 
axed if she'd marry me: she said it was a 
whack; 
Says she to me, Joe Bowers, before we hitch for life, 
You ought to get a 
little home, to keep your little wife. 
Oh Sally! dearest Sally; oh! Sally, for your sake 
I'll go to California, and try to raise a 
stake; 
Says she to me, Joe Bowers, you are the man to will, 
here's a 
kiss to bind the bargain, and she hove a 
dozen in. 
When I 
got to that country, I 
hadn't " nary red," 
I 
had such wolfish feelings, I 
wished myself most dead; 
But the thoughts of my dear Sally, soon made them feelings 
git, 
And whispered hopes to Bowers, I 
wish I 
had em yet. 
At length I 
went to mining, put in my biggest licks, 
Went down upon the boulders just like a 
thousand bricks. 
I 
worked both late and early, in rain, in sun, in snow, 
I 
was working for my Sally, Isms all the same to Joe. 
At length I 
got a 
letter from my dear brother Ike, 
It came from old Missouri, all the way from Pike; 
It brought to me the darndest news, that ever you did hear 
My heart is almost bustin,' so pray excuse this tear. 
It said that Sal was false to me, her love for me had fled, 
She'd got married to a 
butcher, the butcher's hair was red, 
And more than that the letter said, it's enough to make me 
swear, 
That Sally had a 
baby, the baby had red hair. 
Now I've told you all I 
can about this sad affair, 
'Bout Sally marrying a 
butcher, that butcher with red hair, 
But whether 'twits a 
boy or gal child, the letter never said. 
It only said that the baby's hair was inclined to be red. 
JEIRIGHT-EYED LITTLE NELL 
OF NAIMAGANSET-BAY. 
Full well do I 
remember my boyhood's happy hours, 
The cottage and the garden, where bloom'd the fairest flowers; 
The bright and sparkling water o'er which we used to sail, 
With hearts so gay, for miles away, before the gentle gale.. 
I 
had a 
dear companion, but . she's not with me now; 
The lily of the valley is waving o'er her brow ; 
And I 
am sad and lonely, and mourning all the day 
For bright-eyed laughing little Nell of Narraganset-Bay. 
.C110111:S. 
Toll, toll the bell, at early dawn of day, 
For lovely Nell so quickly passed away; 
Toll, toll the bell, a 
soft and mournful lay, 
For bright-eyed laughing little Nell of Narrag,anset-
Bay. 
I 
loved the littlo beauty, my boat it was my pride, 
And with her close beside me, what joy the foam to ride! 
She'd laugh in tones so merry, to see the waves go by, 
As wildly blew the stormy wind, and murky was the sky; 
Though lightnings flash around us, and all was dark and drear, 
We loved to brave Old Ocean, and never dreamed of fear, 
The Arrow bounded onward and darted through the spray, 
With bright-eyed laughing little Nell of Narraganset-Bay. 
Toll, toll the bell, ctEe. 
One day, irom us she wandeed, and soon, within the boat, 
The cord was quickly loosen'd and, with the tide afloat; 
The treacherous bark flew lightly and swift before the wind, 
While home, and friends, and all so dear were many miles behind. 
Next day, her form, all lifeless, was washed upon the beach, 
I 
stood and gazed upon it, bereft of sense and speech. 
"Fie years since thus we parted. but here I 
weep to- day 
For bright-eyed laughing little Nell of Narraganset-Bay; 
Toll, toll the bell, &e.

ERIN'S LOVELY HOME. 
when 
I 
w as youn:,, an in my prime, my age just twent v-one, 
I 
acted as a 
servant unto a 
gentleman ; 
I 
served him true and honest, and very well it's known, 
But in cruelty he banished me from Erin's home. 
For what he did banish me I 
mean to let you hear, 
I 
own I 
loved his daughter, and she loved me as dear, 
She had a 
large fortune, and riches I 
had none, 
And that's the reason I 
must go from Erin's lovely home. 
'Twas in her father's garden, all in the month of June, 
We were viewing of those flowers all in their youthful bloom; 
She said, My dearest William, if with me you will roam, 
We'll bid adieu to all our friends, in Erin's lovely home. 
I 
gave consent that very night, along with her to roam, 
From her father's dwelling—it proved my overthrow; 
The night was bright; by the moonlight we both set off alone, 
Thinking to get safe away from Erin's Lovely Home. 
'When we came to Belfast, by the break of day, 
My love, she then got ready our passage for to pay, 
Five thousand pounds she counted down, saying this shall be your 
own, 
But do not mourn for those we've left in Erin's Lovely Home. 
'Tis of our sad misfortin I 
mean to let you hear, 
'Twas in a 
few hours after, her father did appear. 
He marched me back to Homer jail in the county of Tyrone, 
And there I 
was transported from Erin's Lovely Home. 
When I 
heard my sentence it grieved my heart full sore, 
But parting from my true-love it grieved me ten times more. 
I 
had seven links upon my chain, for every link a 
year, 
Before I 
can return again to the arms of my dear. 
While I 
lay under sentence, before I 
sailed away, 
My love, she came into the jail, and thus to me did say; 
Cheer up your heart, don't be dismayed, for I'll not you disown, 
tutu l 
you do return again to Erin's Lovely home.

FOLKS THAT PUT ON AIRS. 
Oh, White Folks, listen will you now, this darkey's going to sing, 
I've hit upon a 
subject now—I 
think will he the thing— 
I 
never like to mix at all with any one's affairs, 
But my opinion am just now, " bout folks that put on airs.— 
CLIORUS. 
No use talking, no use talking, 
it's so now every where, 
To do as folks of fashion do, 
You've got to put on airs. 
De Politicians first of all on leetion day will steno, 
And every man dat passes by he'll sheke him by the hand; 
But when he gets a 
good fat job, for chit auf all he cares, 
He thinks himself some punikins den, eh, don't he put on airs? 
No use talking, tile. 
When a 
gal gets " 'bout sixteen, she gins to think she's some, 
A 
fop that sports a 
bi,.; moustache, she kinder likes to come, 
Two hours" 'fore the looking glass, to meet him she prepare; 
And when she gets her fixens on, oh, don't she put on airs ? 
No use talking, (ie. 
A 
boy too, when he's about half grown, although he's " nary red,* 
Has lots of hair around his mouth, but more upon his head; 
lie partronises, tailor shop gets trust for all he wears, 
And when he goes amongst the gals, oh, den't he put on airs? 
No use talking, Ike. 
Dar's the great Atlantic Cable, some time ago " twas laid, 
Both Uncle Sam and Johnny Bull den thought dare fortune's made; 
Somehow or other, I 
don't know, but folks dat hold de share; 
Begin to kinder think dey 're right in putting on some airs. 
No use talking, &c. 
Tis true we Yankees go ahead in all we undertake, 
There's Ten Broeck, and great Karey too, can British horses break.; 
Dar's Morphy next, a 
Chessman he, his laurel proudly wears. 
Old Johnny Bull can't come to tea, and need t

No use talking, cic.

NETTIE :MOORE. 
In a 
little white cottage, where the trees are ever green, 
And the climbing roses blossom by the door, 
I've often sat and listened to the music of the birds, 
And the gentle voice of pretty Nettie Moore, 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
miss you, Nettie Moore, and my happiness is o'er, 
While a 
spirit sad around my heart has come; 
And the busy days are long, and the nights are lonely now, 
For you're gone from our little cottage home. 
Below us, in the valley, on the Santee's dancing tide, 
Of a 
summer's eve, I'd launch my open boat; 
And when the moon was rising, and the stars began to shine, 
Down the river we so merrily would float. 
Oh, I 
miss you, Nettie Moore, &c. 
One sunny day in Autumn, ere the dew had left the lawn, 
Came a 
trader up from Louisiana Bay, 
Who gave to master money, and then shackl'd her with chains; 
And then he took her off to work her life away. 
Oh, I 
miss you, Nettie Moore, An. 
Since that time the world is dreary, aryl I 
long from earth to rise 
And join the happy angels gone before; 
never can be merry, for my heart is full of woe, 
And I'm pining for my pretty Nettie Moore. 
Oh, I 
miss you, Nettie Moore, &e. 
You are gone, lovely Nettie, and my heart must surely break, 
When the tears come no more into my eyes; 
But when weary life is past, I 
shall meet you once again 
In Heaven, darling, up above the skies ! 
Oh, I 
miss you, Nettie Moore, drc.

FATHER TOM O'NEIL. 
PART HINT 
There was a 
widow lived in this place, she had three charming 
sons; 
Their father died, and left them when they were very young. 
A long time she endeavored to maintain her darlin7 sons, 
Until the youngest one became a 
Mall at the age of twenty-one. 
One night, he discoursed with his mother, these words to her did 
say: 
I 
think it will fall on one of us to go far away; 
Your land is too small to support us all, and if you would agree, 
I 
am fully bent and well content a 
clergyman to be. 
his mother being glad to hear sueh a 
thought come in his mind, 
She says, I 
will do all I 
can to help my darling child. 
She spoke unto his brothers, and they did soon agree 
They'd send him off to college, a 
clergyman to be. 
He was not long in college, when the Rev. Bishop Brown 
Came to examine the collegians, and viewed them all around. 
He saw this clever young man, marked him above them all, 
lie was the first he did discourse when on them he did call. 
He says: Young man, where are you from ? come tell to me your 
name. 
I 
am from the County Armagh, they call me Tom O'Neil; 
Aly mother, she is a 
widow of a 
low degree; 
She has done her best endeavors to make a 
priest of me. 
As Thomas O'Neil then is your name, the Bishop he did say, 
Go study hard, both night and day ; 
I 
will have you soon ordained, to help your tender mother that did 
so well for thee; 
will send you home, a 
credit your country boys to see. 
When this young man came home ordained, the neighbors were 
glad to hear, 
And all that came to welcome him, came in twos and threes; 
Particularly his own dear friend:: to welcome him they ran, 
And you never saw such welcome as was for the widow's son. 
There was a 
man lived in this place, he was as rich as a 
Duke or 
Knight; 
He had an only daughter, she was a 
beauty bright. 
She says unto her father ; I 
will go this young man to see, 
For before he went to college he was a 
school-boy along with me. 
She was brought into a 
parlor, where she drank ale and wine; 
She says: You are a 
clever young man, I 
would have you resign. 
What made you be a 
clergyman? you know you are astray; 
For a 
clergyman must rise by night, and travel hard by day. 
Come, take some noble lady, whose fortune will be grand ; 
You will have men to wait on you, and be a 
gentleman. 
Come, take myself, now, as I 
stand; you know my fortune is great 
I 
have ten thousand pounds a-year, and, at a 
death, a 
whole estate. 
.111161b... 
FATHER TOM O'NEIL. 
PART SECOND AND LAST. 
He says: My noble lady, do not explain your mind; 
For, if you offer ten times more, I 
would not resign; 
For, in this holy station I 
mean to lead my life ; 
So, say no more, my dearest dear, I 
will never take a 
wife. 
It was when he did deny her, this villain she came home: 
And in eight weeks after, her secret she let know: 
She swore, before the magistrate, that he did her beguile, 
And for four long weeks, before she went to him, she was with 
child. 
The morning of his trial, it grieved our hearts full sore 
To see his tender mother : It grieved her ten times more 
To see her son, a 
clergyman , his age about twenty-three, 
To be cut down, in his prune, by cruel perjury. 
Now, Tom, what is the reason you don't marry this fair ? 
I 
think she is a 
companion for a 
duke, I 
declare: 
What are you, but a 
widow's sou, that is both poor and mean I' 
You might think it a 
great hoaor such a 
lady to obtain 1 
Then Father Tom stood up and said; I 
have no witness here: 
I 
call on the Almighty arid he will make me clear: 
I 
never said I 
would marry her, or make her my wife; 
For, I 
neve_ knew a 
female from a 
man in all my life. 
Now, Tom, as you won't marry her, I 
will give you to understand: 
Seven long years transportation into Van Dieman's Land: 
That is bad, but it might be worse. 
Then Father Tom did say 
Our Savior suffered more than that, when he died on calvary. 
These words were hardly spoken, when a 
horse came as swift as 
wind, 
And on him came a 
rider, saying : I 
was not here in time I 
I 
call that trial over again, I 
am here that can reply : 
She wants two fathers for her child: that's Father Torn and I. 
I 
can tell the very moment, likewise the very spot. 
She gave me ten thousand pounds the night the child was got. 
She said she would give me a 
thousand more, if I 
would not let on 
She wants to make a 
husband of the Right Reverend Father Tom h 
Then, Father Tom put on his hat, and then began to smile ; 
He says unto his mother' you see how God assists your child 1 
They looked on one another, when they found her perjury ; 
The villain was found guilty, and his Reverence came home free,

BANKS OF SWEET DUNDEE. 
It is of a 
farmer's daughter,. as beautiful I'm told, 
Tier parents died and left her a 
large amount in gold, 1 
She lived with her Uncle, the cause of all her woe, 
But you soon shall hear this maiden fair did prove his overthrow 
ller uncle had a 
plough- boy young Mary loved quite well, 
And in her uncle's garden their tales of love would tell, 
There was a 
wealthy Squire that oft came her to see, 
But still she loved her plough- buy on the banks of sweet Dundee. 
It was on a 
summer's morning, her uncle went straightway, 
He knoc.ked at this maiden's door and unto her did say, 
Arise, arise, my wetty maid, and a 
lady you may be, 
For the Squire is waiting for y,..0 on the banks of sweet Dundee. 
I 
care not for your squires, your dukes, or lords likewise, 
My Willie's eyes appear to me like diamonds in the skies; 
Begone, unruly female, you infer shall happy be, 
For I 
intend to banish William from the banks of sweet Dundee. 
Her uncle and the Squire rode out one summer's day, 
Young William is in favor, her uncle ho did say, 
Indeed, it is 
intentioa to tie him to a 
tree, 
And then to brib a 
press-gang on the banks of sweet Dundee. 
A pressgang came to William when he was all alone, 
He boldly fought for lilmay, but they were six to one, 
The blood did flow in torrents, way kill me now said he, 
For I 
will die for Mary on the banks of sweet Dundee. 
This maiden fair, walking, lamenting for her love, 
She met this wealthy Squire down in her uncle's grove, 
lie put his arm around her, stand off base man, said she, 
Yon have sent the only lad I 
loved from the banks of sweet 
Dundee. 
He put his arm around her and tried to throw her down, 
Two pistols and a 
sword she saw beneath his morning gown, 
She took the weapons from hint, his sword he used so free, 
But she did fire, and shot the Squire, on the banks of sweet 
Dundee. 
Her uncle overheard the noise, and hastening to the ground. 
Saying, since you have killed the Squire, I 
will give you your 
death wound. 
Stand off, then, cried young Mary, undaunted I 
will be, 
She the trigger drew, and her uncle slew, on the banks of sweet 
Dundee. 
A doctor soon was sent for, a 
man of noted skill, 
And then there came a 
lawyer for him to sign his will, 
Ile willed his gold to Mary, who fought so manfully, 
Then he closed his eyes, no more to rise, on the banks of sweet 
Dundee.

LIMERICK RACES. 
I'm a 
simple Irish lad, I've resolved to see some fun, sirs, 
So, to satisfy my mind, to Limerick town I 
come, sirs; 
Oh, murther ! what a 
precious place, and what a 
charming city, 
-Where the boys are all so free, and the girls are all so pretty! 
Muslin, ring a

RI too rat laddy Oh! 
Musha ring a

RI too rail laddy Oh! 
It was on the first of May, when I 
began my rambles, 
When everything was there, both jaunting cars and gambols; 
I 
looked along the road, what was lined with smiling faces, 
All driving off ding-dong, to go and see the races. 
Musha ring a

So then I 
was resolved to go and see the race, sirs, 
And on a 
coach and four I 
neatly took my place, sirs, 
When a 
chap bawls out " behind !" and the coachman dealt a 
blow, sirs, 
Faith, he hit me just as fair as if his eyes were in his poll, sirs. 
Musha ring a

So then I 
had to walk, and make no great delay, sirs, 
Until I 
leached the course, where everything WaS gay, sirs : 
It's then I 
spied a 
wooden house, and in the upper story, 
The baud struck up a 
tune, called " Garry Owen and glory." 
Musha ring a

There was fiddlers playing jigs, there was lads and lassies dancing, 
And chaps upon their nags, round the course sure they were 
prancing, 
Some was drinking whishey-punch, while others titled out gaily, 
"Hurrah then for the shamrock green, and the splinter of

There were betters to and fro, to see who would win the race, sirs, 
And one of the sporting chaps of course came up to me, sirs; 
Says he " l'll bet you fifty pounds, and I'll put it down this minute," 
" 
Ali, then ten to one," says I. " the foremost horse will win it." 
Musha ring a

When the players came to town, and a 
funny set was they, 
I 
paid my two thirteens to go and see the play, 
They acted kings and cobblers, queens, and everything so gaily, 
But I 
found myself at home when they struck up " Paddy Carey."

THE LADS WHO LIVE IN IRELAND: 
OR, WHERE TIIE APPLE PRATIES GROW. 
My name is Ned O'Manney, I 
was born in sweet Killarney; 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plough, reap or mow ; 
And, if I 
met a 
pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know: 
I'm none of your Bul,grudderies, nor other shabby families, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show: 
Oh ! I'm of the O's and Mac's, and likewise the sturdy Whacks, 
CHORUS. 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've ninety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry, 
And each unto their name has a 
Mac or an 0; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan: 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show : 
I'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and 1 
never was afraid; 
For, I 
was born in Ireland, & c. 
May Heaven still protect our hospitable Country. 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, and heard its cocks to crow ! 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely bay of Bantry ! 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to show. 
Oh ! those scenes I 
did enjoy, like a 
gay, unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, etc, 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man in truth, was he; 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go : 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be : 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show ; 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found. 
Than the lads who live in Ireland, d7e. 
LARBOARD WATCH.

At dreary midnight's cheerless hour, 
Deserted e'en by Cynthia's beams, 
When tempests beat and torrents pour, 
And twinkling stars no longer gleam,

And still the lengthened hour to wile,

But hers to who we glide.

As starry eyes to see: 
. Oh think what tales" twould have to tell 
Of wand'ring youths like me. 
Row gently, & c. 
Now rest thee here, my Gondolier; 
Hush hush, for up I 
go— 
To climb you light belongs to night, 
Whilst thou keepest watch below. 
All I

But half such pains as we, 
Take day and night for woman's love, 
What angels we should be.

HARD UP. 
In the days when I 
was hard up, not many years ago, 
I 
suffered that which only can the sons of misery know. 
Relations, friends, companions, they all turned up their nose, 
And rated me a 
vagabond, for the want of better clothes. 
CLORUS. 
Hard up, I'm hard up, and I 
never can forget, 
The days when I 
was better off—I 
may be well off yet. 
In the days when I 
was hard up, for the want of food and fire: 
I 
used to tie my shoes up with little bits of wire. 
Hungry, cold, cast on a 
rock, and could not get a 
meal, 
1 
often beat the devil down, for tempting me to steal. 
Hard up, I'm hard up, &c. 
In the days when I 
was hard up, for furniture, and drugs, 
How often have I 
held communion with the bugs. 
I 
never faced them with a 
spite, nor smashed them cn the wall; 
I 
said the world was big enough, there's room enough for all. 
Hard up, I'm hard up, (te. 
In the days when I 
was hard up, I 
ired to lock my door, 
For fear my landlady would say ; " You can't lodge here no more." 
And in my own little back parlor, that was ten feet by six ; 
And the workhouse wall right opposite—I've counted all the bricks. 
Hard up, I'm hard up, & c. 
In the days when I 
was hard tip, I 
bowed my spirit down; 
How often have I 
sought a 
friend, to borrow half a 
crown. 
How many are there, in this world, ( that is if I 
would kan,) 
With their shabby suits of toggery, but can not see the man. 
Hard up, I'm hard up, tte. 
In the days when I 
was hard up, for want of blissful hope, 
It was the poor man's heritage, to keep him from the rope. 
But I 
have found a 
good old maxim, and this shall be my plan; 
Although I 
wear a 
ragged coat, I'll wear it like a 
man. 
Hard up, I'm hard up, &e. 
GOOD NEWS FROM HOME. 
Good news from home—good news for me, 
Has come across the deep blue sea, 
From friends that I 
have left in tears— 
From friends that I've not seen for years. 
And since we parted long ago, 
My life has been a 
scene of woe, 
But now a 
joyful hour has come, 
For I 
have heard good news from home. 
Good news from home, good news for me, 
Has come across the deep blue sea, 
From friends that I 
have left in tears, 
From friends that I've not seen for years. 
No father's near to guide me now, 
No mother's tear to soothe my brow, 
No sister's voice falls on my ear, 
Nor brother's smile to give me cheer. 
But, though I 
wander far away, 
My heart is full of joy to-day, 
For friends across the ocean's foam 
Have sent to me, good news from home. 
Good news from home, & c. 
When shall I 
see that cottage door, 
Where I've spent years of joy before? 
'Twas there I 
knew no grief or care, 
My heart was always happy there. 
Though I 
may never see it more, 
Nor stand upon my native shore, 
Where'er on earth I'm doomed to roam, 
My heart will be with those at home. 
Good news from home, &e.

Y'cd:se ;
ooking as fresh as the morn, darling, 
You're looking as bright as the day; 
But while on your charms I'm dilating, 
You're stealing my poor heart away; 
But keep it and welcome, mavourneen, 
Its loss I'm not going to mourn, 
Yet one heart's enough for a 
body, 
So pray give me yours in return, 
Mavourneen, mavourneen, 
Oh! pray give yours in return. 
I've built me a 
neat little cot, darling, 
I've pigs and potatoes in store; 
I've twenty good pounds in the bank, love, 
And may be a 
pound or two more. 
It's all very well to have riches, 
But I'm such a 
covetous elf, 
I 
can't help still sighing for something, 
And, darling, that's something's yourself, 
Mavourneen, mavourneen, 
And that something, you know, is yourself. 
You're smiling, and that's a 
good sign, darling, 
Say " Yes," and you'll never repent, 
Or, if you would rather be silent, 
Your silence 11 take for consent. 
That good natured dimple's a 
tell-tale, 
Now all that I 
have is your own, 
This week you may be Kitty Tyrrell, 
Next week you'll be Mistress Malone, 
Mavourneen, mavourneen, 
You'll be my own Mistress Malone. 
It's when I'm far away from home, 
In foreign lands to dwell, 
You must think of me, Sweet Allie dear, 
And look for my return. 
CHORUS. 
Then, good bye, good-bye, Allie dear, 
I'm leaving you alone; 
For, I'm going, going far away, 
But look for my return I 
I 
left you into the hall- door, 
Standing all alone ; 
When I 
kissed your cheek, sweet Allie dear 
And promised to return. 
Then good-by, & c. 
It was on that lovely grassy plain, 
That we together roamed; 
I 
kissed the tears from off your cheeks, 
And parted to return. 
Then good-by, & c. 
Then let not tears bestream thine eyes, 
Or sorrow craze thine heart ; 
But one kind look, sweet Attie dear! 
And, true love, we will part. 
Then good-by, &c.

Softly falls thy silver light, 
As thou movest from earth afar,

Beautiful star, beautiful star, 
Star of the evening, 
Beautiful, beautiful star. 
In fancy's eye thou seemst to say, 
Follow me, come from earth away, 
Upward thy spirit's pinions try, 
To realms of love beyond the sky. 
Beautiful star, &c. 
Shine on ! oh, star or love divine, 
And may our souls around thee twine, 
As thou movest from earth afar, 
Star of the twilight, beautiful star,

loved, 
In my happy; early days? 
Do they think of him (or her) who came, 
But could never win their praise, 
I 
am happy by his (or her) side, 
And from mine he'll (or she'll) never roam; 
But my heart will sadly sigh, 
Do they think of me, at home ? 
Do they think of me, & c. 
Do they think of me, at eve ? 
Of the songs I 
used to sing? 
Is the harp I 
struck, untouched ? 
Does a 
stranger wake the string? 
Will no kind, forgiving word 
Come across the raging foam ? 
Shall I 
never cease to sigh: 
Do they think of me, at home ? 
Do they think of me, ctl,c. 
FROM TIIE TOWN OF DUBLIN, 
Words and Music by IL MILLARD. 
I 
left me ould mother wid one little brother, 
And came to this country when scarcely a 
boy; 
And though I 
am Irish, and lived on the Parish, 
I'm first-cousin-german to Patrick Malloy, 
I 
came in short breeches that often lacked stitches, 
had nails in me E 
hoes fit for horses to wear ; 
Me mother'd not know me, but if you would show me, 
I'd quick know me mother and Dublin of yore. 
CHORUS 
I'm Teddy McGlynn from the town of Dublin, 
And that is the name you will find on me door. 
I've worked, and I've waited, me brains I've berated; 
I've been to the schools, and to Lanigan's Ball; 
Me father was uncle to Kathleen Mavourneen 
So Fin proud of me kindred, me mother, and all. 
But now I'm a 
lawyer, and feel like a 
warrior ; 
PH dance you the Lancers or jig, if you call. 
I've kept me shillelah, and own l'm most crazy 
To see me ould mother and Dublin once more. 
I'm Teddy McGlynn, & c. 
And soon I'll be goin' the truth to be knowin',1 
And judge for meself of ould Ireland's woes; 
If green I 
ant wearing, the Shamrock is sharing 
The love in me heart for me country's repose. 
For light is now dawning, and Liberty's morning 
Will shed its warm ray on mild Ireland's shore ; 
Then Katy 
marry, and no longer tarry 
To see me ould mother and Dublin once more. 
Then Mister McGlynn, when at home in Dublin, 
Will welcome you all at his new cabin door. 
I've found many cronies amongst the Malonys, 
And often drank whiskey wid Melia' O'Toole ; 
O'Brien and MeNielly and or Miles O'Reilly, 
Were all of us sprung when we waked Tim McDoul 
in the finest society, famed for sobriety, 
I'm welcomed with pride at each Fenian ball ; 
FR soon be an Alderman, like Jimmy Flanagan, 
Who lives on Fifth Avenue, as good as them all. 
I'm Teddy McGlynn, cire,

THOU HAST WOUNDED THE SPIRIT 
THAT LOVED THEE. 
Thou hast wounded the spirit that loved thee, 
And cherished thine image for years, 
Thou hast taught me at last to forget thee, 
In secret, in silence, and tears. 
As the young bird when left by its mother, 
Its earliest pinions to try, 
Round the nest will still lingering hover, 
its trembling wings can fly. 
Ero 
Thus we're taught in this cold world to smother, 
Each feeling that once was so dear; 
Like that young bird I'll seek to discover 
A home of affection elsewhere. 
Tho' this heart may still cling to thee fondly. 
And dream of sweet memories past, 
Yet hope, like the rainbow of summer, 
Gives a 
prc,mise, of Lethe at Lust. 
NEAR THE BANKS OF THAT LONE RIVER. 
Near the banks of that lone river, 
Where the water lillies grow, 
Breathed the fairest flower that ever 
Bloomed and faded years ago; 
How we met and loved and parted, 
None on earth can ever know, 
Nor how pure and gentle-hearted, 
Beamed the mourn'd one, years ago. 
CLIORUS. 
Near the banks of that lone river, 
Where the water lillies grow, 
Breathed the fairest flower that ever 
Bloomed and faded long ago. 
Like the stream with lillies laden, 
Will life's future current flow, 
Till in heaven I 
meet the maiden, 
Fondly cherished years ago ; 
Hearts that love like mine forget not, 
They're the same in weal or woe, 
And that star of memory set not, 
in the grave of years ago. 
Near the banks, cke.

THE DREAM OF BONAPARTE. 
One night, sad and languid, I 
went to my bed, 
And scarce had reclin'd on my pillow, 
When a 
vision surprising came into my head— 
Methought I 
was crossing the billow. 
Methought, as my vessel dashed over the deep, 
I 
beheld that rude rock that grows craggy and steep, 
Ah the rock where the willow is now seen to weep, 
O'er the grave of that once famed Napoleon. 
I 
dreamt as my vessel she neared to the land, 
I 
beheld, clad in green, his bold figure; 
The trumpet of fame he clasped firm in his hand, 
On his brow there sat valor and rigor: 
" 
Ah, stranger," cried he, " hast thou ventured to me, 
From the land of thy forefathers, who boast they're frPe 
If so, a 
true story I'll tell unto thee, 
Concerning the once famed Napoleon 
" 
Remember that year so immortai,7' 
he cried, 
" 
When I 
crossed the rude Alps, famed in story, 
With the legions of France, for her sous were my pride, 
And led them to honor and glory 
On the plains of Marengo, I 
tyranny hurl'd, 
And wherever my banner the eagle unfurl'd, 
'Tw:ts the standard of freedom all over the world, 
The signal of fame," cried Napoleon. 
" 
As a 
soldier I've borne both the heat and the cold, 
I 
have march'd to the trumpet and cymbal ; 
But by dark deeds of treachery I 
have been sold, 
Tho' monarchs before me did tremble. 
Now rulers and princes their stations demean, 
And like scorpions they spit forth their venom 
But liberty soon o'er the world shall be seen," 
AS 
I 
woke from my dream, cried Napoleon.

Air—" In a 
Cottage Near a 
Wood." 
In my cottage, near a 
wood, 
Lived two damsels, young and good— 
In a 
cottage, quite close by, 
Lived a 
man who was mighty high, 
His name was Blue Beard, so they say. 
Returning home one very fine day, 
He met a 
damsel young and good, 
In a 
cottage near a 
wood. 
Air—" Bill Jenkins." 
Now Blue Beard had six wives in his day, 
And they all disappeared in a 
curious way, 
He wanted another—on them he did pitch, 
It was one of the sisters—he did not care which, 
With his cooing and wooing, 
Lying and sighing, 
The young one consented 
To be Mrs. Blue Beard. 
Air—" Paddy's Wedding." 
Blythe and gay they spent the day, 
When friends were all invited, Oh ! 
The honeymoon soon passed away, 
And the happy pair united, oh. 
But, fatal, as it came to pass, 
Blue Beard he to the wars did go; 
Like knights of old—for silver and gold 
He buckled on belt and sabre, oh. 
Air—" Sinbad the Sailor." 
Then he called to his wife, 
And he said, on your life, 
Now, mind what I 
tell you— do dear; 
I'll give you the keys, you can go where you please, 
Only, not to the chamber that's blue, dear, 
Don't go the chamber that's blue, dear, 
l'll cut off your head if you do, dear; 
Then, mounting his steed, he set off at full speed, 
Saying, " Don't go to the chamber that's blue, dear."

BARBE BLETTE.—[CONTINUED1 
Air—" Bobbing Around." 
When Blue Beard's wife went looking around, 
Around, around, around, around, 
The many wonders that she saw, 
When she went looking around. 
And when she looked in every room, 
Looking around, around, around, 
To the fatal chamber at last she came, 
As she went looking around. 
Air—" The Maniac." 
She turned the lock—she dropped the key, 
Oh! what is that on the wall I 
see ? 
I 
see them hanging on the wall— 
I 
see them hanging on the wall! 
Oh ! release me—oh, release me! 
Or the sight of it—the sight will drive me mad. ! 
Air—" Oh, Susannah." 
She picked up the key, and hopped down stairs 
As light as any cat, 
And though her name was Fatima, 
She was not over fat, 
And when she reached the bottom, 
Quite thunderstruck she stood— 
She rubbed and scrubbed the key, 
But could not move the blood. 
Oh, Mrs. Blue Beard lives ix fear and dread, 
To unfold a 
tale of misery, perhaps; 
She might lose her head. 
Air—" Who's dat Knocking at the Door." 
When Blue Beard came back, 
And the keys to him were brought 
Oh! he pulled a 
long face when he saw one short, 
Where's the key of the chamber ? 
Oh ! isn't it there ? I 
shall be found out, 
Oh! laws! Oh I 
dear! 
Who's been unlocking of the door, 
Yes, you've been unlocking of the door. 
Oh ! it's no use to cry, these tears are all my eye, 
For you've been unlocking of the door. 
BARBE BLEUE.--[coNcramEn.] 
Air—" The Tempest of the Heart." 
Oh! husband, pray do hear me, 
Wrong I 
was to go there— wrong I 
was to go. 
But you'll forgive me— yes, you'll forgive me, 
But Blue Beard answered " No !" 
Dry those tears—those tears unavailing flow, 
Dry those tears and prepare to die. 
011! my husband, do not kill me— 
Oh! my husband do not kill me, 
If you do, why you will rue, 
For ' twill surely break my heart. 
Air—" Mary Ann." 
Do look around my dear sister Ann. 
Do look around for awhile ; 
For my brothers are coming, 
Do give them the summons. 
For I 
am doomed to die, sister Ann— 
Yes, I 
am doomed to die, sister Ann, 
Air—" Yes, Think of Me." 
Yes, I 
am doomed to die— 
Yes, I 
am doomed to die, 
Why did I 
go to the fatal room ? 
Through disobedience I 
must die. 
Air—" Polly, Won't You Try Me." 
Just at the time the brothers came in—Ri tol, Sze. 
They took old Blue Beard by the chin—Ri tol, 
Then toA their sister, Blue Beard's wife—Ri tol, cte. 
They took their swords and took his life—Ri tol, Ste. 
Air—" Red, White and Blue." 
Now ladies with true devotion, 
Love your husbands and mind what I 
say, 
Like a 
barque on the briny ocean, 
Your time will ride happily away, 
And never disobey your husbands, 
But always to them prove true; 
If the tie you should try to sever, 
Why you're sure to be found out if you do.'

I'D CHOOSE TO BE A BABY. 
ORIGINAL VERSION, 
I'd choose to be a 
babv, 
A darling little flower, 
Without a 
care or sorrow, 
As I 
was in childhood's hour. 
When ladies, Heaven bless them 
They'd kiss me, and they'd vow 
That they could almost eat me— 
Why don't they do it now ? 
CHORUS. 
I'd choose to be a 
baby, 
A darling little flower, 
For the girls to kiss and cuddle me, 
As they did in childhood's hour. 
When I 
used to be a 
baby, 
They'd to my cradle creep ; 
They'd kiss and hug and cuddle me, 
Till I 
fell off to sleep. 
Yes, they'd kiss and squeeze me, too, 
Till I 
felt anyhow, 
They'd even wash and dress me— 
Why don't they do it now? 
I'd choose to be a 
baby, Sz.e. 
For pleased they were to nurse me, 
They would take me on their lap, 
And would stuff my little bells' full 
Of lollipop and pap. 
They would chew me tops and bottoms, 
And if I 
made a 
row, 
They'd press me to their bosoms— 
Why don't they do it now ? 
I'd choose to be a 
baby, &c. 
When the ladies used to love me, 
They would make me such nice clothes; 
They would make me nice morocco shoes, 
And wipe my little nose. 
And when the shades of evening came, 
And sleep came o'er my brow, 
They said: It's time to go to bed— 
But they never say so now. 
I'd choose to be a 
baby, (tc. 
THE INDIAN HUNTER. 
Let me go to my home in the far distant west 
To the scenes of my youth, that I 
like the best; 
Where the tall cedars are and the bright waters flow, 
Where my parents will greet me—white man let me go. 
Let me go to the spot where the cataract plays, 
Where oft I 
have sported in my boyish days, 
There is my poor mother, whose heart will o'er-flow, 
At the sight of her child—oh, there let me go. 
Let me go to the hills and the valleys so fair, 
Where oft I 
have breathed my own mountain air, 
And there through the forest with quiver and bow, 
I 
have chased the wild deer—oh, there let me go. 
Let me go to my father, by whose valiant side, 
I 
have sported so oft in the height of my pride, 
And exulted to conquer the insolent foe— 
To my father, that chieftain—oh, there let me go. 
And, oh, let me go to my dark- eyed maid, 
Who taught me to love beneath the willow shade ; 
Whose hearts like the fawn's, as pure as the snow, 
And she loves her dear Indian—to her let me go. 
And, oh, let me go to my fair forest home, 
And never again will I 
wish to roam, 
And there let my body in ashes lie low; 
To that scene in the forest, white man, let me go.

BEAUTIFUL LEAVES. 
Beautiful leaves in their midsummer splendor, 
Clothing the forest in emerald green— 
Where are the blooms that such beauty can render, 
Or spread such a 
fullness or grace o'er the scene ? 
Every gay tint of the sweet garden flowers; 
Every bright, garland that hinocence weaves ; 
Though culled from the fairest of nature's gay bowers, 
Looks cold, if not blended with beautiful leaves. 
Beautiful leaves in the Winter time falling. 
Oft have I 
thought, as they dropped one by one, 
That they were obeying some mystical calling. 
That lured them away when the Summer was gone. 
And knowing the Spring will their brightness restore us, 
I 
have thought as the cold earth their ashes receives, 
That we too must fade, like the dead leaves before us, 
And bloom once again, like those beautiful leaves. 
THE MAN WHO CAN'T KEEP STILL .. 
Since the days when I 
was a 
little child, 
I've heard my mother say. 
There was nothing ever would keep me still, 
By night or yet by day. 
I'm a 
man grown up, but it's all the same, 
For, do whatever I 
will. 
'Tis a 
fact that, whether I 
sit or stand, 
I 
really can't keep still. 
I 
really, die. 
When at school, they sat me on a 
chair ; 
My feet went tap, tap, tap: 
When I 
said my task, I 
was jig, jig, jig, 
'Till oft I 
got the strap, 
If I 
went to church it was all the same, 
Tho' seated in a 
pew— 
I 
was safe, before all the prayers were done, 
To dance a 
step or two. 
I 
really, die. 
Then a 
shop I 
had, but upon my word, 
When customers came in. 
Why I 
jigg'd away and said, " What's for you ?' 
While they stood all a 
grin. 
But the end soon came, and the shop was shut, 
The landlord seized for rent— 
When the brokers came and they sold my goods, 
Why, dancing out I 
went. 
I 
really, are

PADDY IS THE BOY, 
It's some years ago, I 
very well know, 
Since I 
first saw day-light with my two blessed eyes°, 
I 
was born, so they say, when my Dad was away, 
On St. Patrick's day, in the morning-. 
How they nursed me with joy; said: what a 
fine boys 
Put a 
stick in my fist, by the way of a 
toy; 
Faith! there's no mistake, they admired my make, 
And said some day I'd give the girls a 
warming. 
For, Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
glass, 
Phddy is the boy that's fond of a 
lass! 
Dear Old Dublin is the place for me, 
And Donnybrook is the place to go for a 
spree. 
At a 
wake or a 
fair, poor Paddy is there ; 
Be will fight foe or friend, if they do him offend; 
Let the piper strike up, he will rise from his cup, 
With a 
smile on his face adorning. 
With his little Colleen, he'll dance on the green, 
Sure, an Irishman, there, in his glory was seen 
Play a 
reel or jig, he don't care a 
fig 
But he'll dance till day-
light, in the morning. 
For, Paddy is the boy, die. 
Now boys, do you mind; you never will find, 
Such a 
dear little place as the Emerald Isle; 
Long, long, may it stand, and good luck to the land, 
That dear Old St. F ',trick was born in ! 
May the girls, young _ad old, may the boys, brave and bold, 
Unite, heart and hand, to protect the dear Isle ! 
And, morn. noon and night, may joy and delight 
Shine on them, like a 
fine Summer's morning. 
For, Paddy is the boy, die.

OUR GRAND-FATHERS' DAYS. 
A on 
or to please all my kind friends before me: 
I've been thinking, of late, a 
new subject to raise., 
And one l've got and 1 
know it will please you: 
I 
am going to sing of our grand- fathers' days. 
In our grand- fathers' days, men were judged but by merit, 
And those who were sound, got their measure of praise; 
But, now-a 
days, folks judge of men by their money 
That wasn't the ca.se in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand- fathers days they had no patent leathers, 
Garot-choking collars, or no peg tops pants ; 
Young men didn't go it with t 
wo-forty horses, 
Or visit young ladies, at night at their aunt's, 
The boys didn't then congregate on the corners 
To see the gals crossing, on wet slushy days, 
Nor the gals didn't vant a 
policeman to help them— 
That wasn't the style in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand-fathers' days, billiard-markers ne'er sported 
nestache on their lips, or goatees on their chins, 
Nor did six penny barbers drive out in light wagons, 
Nor did tish-ball waiters wear diamond pins. 
The gals didn't paint, stuff themselves up with cotton, 
They didn't wear hoops, patent bustles or stays, 
Didn't smoke cigarettes, or drink cock-tads at Taylor's: 
That wasn't the style in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days married men they were steady; 
You'd not find them out every day of their lives, 
Nor see them out, late, walking home with their cousins; 
They always retired in good time to their wives ; 
They had no Champag,ne-suppers, no little flirtations, 
No trying to go it in various ways; 
Didn't stop in saloons with a 
female acquaintance— 
They had no waiter girls in our grandfathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days, when a 
man ran for office, 
He did it alone for the national good, 
And not for the dollars and cents he might pocket— 
That is something that, now-a- days, ain't understood. 
The Government, then, was for wisdom selected; 
Rebellion hadn't set the Country a- blaze; 
But the people have sworn that our Flag shall float over 
The Union that was in our grand-fathers' days
