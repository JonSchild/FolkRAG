Come, list' to my song, I

'Tis something I'd have you all pleased at; 
Through life as I

I'm not to be sneezed at, 
No, I'm not to be sneezed at ; 
Drink-a-clum-day, I'm hunky-doray 
And a

For me de gals rave, and my photograph crave, 
And all my cards taken am seized at ; 
Dey'll obey it fuss, and give it a

'Cans dey know dat I'm not to be sneezod at. 
I'm not to be, dx. 
In togs neat and fine, to appear I

So ob course by de tailors I'm seized at,

Our ladies now days dress in all sorts of ways, 
And dear Papas for money am teased at, 
Sonic new fashion to buy, dat has taken de eye, 
To show you dey're not to be sneezed at. 
Dey're not to be, &c. 
True as preachin' it am, dis world's but a

DOESN'T SHE SLING HERSELF. 
Written by II. Angelo. 
Sung by Frank Moran, of Carneross & Dixey's Minstrels. 
Air.—" What Can The Matter Be ?" 
Oh, my ! doesn't she sling herself ? 
Oh, dear ! doesn't she fling herself? 
Do tell ! to what will she brinc, herself ? 
Dis period gal dat I 
know. 
She's nineteen years old or somewhere there about, 
At de back ob her head there's a 
bushel ob hair 
about 
A great big chignon and false curls to wear about 
'When she goes out for a 
show. 
Oh, my ! doesn't she, & e. 
Ma-til-da Jane dis gal's name it am, 
To be some pumpkins her aim it am ; 
And sell some fels' of spondulix fame it am. 
Dat's what she am up to, I 
know. 
Every day on Chestnut street she cuts a 
swell, 
And at night in de ball room she am de belle ; 
So much so dat all de young bloods in lub hab 
fell, 
And wants to be ' Tilda Jane's beau. 
Oh, my I 
doesn't she, & c. 
SONGSTER. 
Oh, my ! if see dis gal you could, 
Fall smack in lub, I 
know you would ; 
And go a 
whole week without your food, 
'Cause ' Tilda you'd halo on the brain. 
De first time I 
met her she stole my heart away, 
De next, if I'd let her, she'd hub led my head 
astray ; 
But the third time, 0 
golly, dis I 
had to say :— 
Shoo fly—don't bodder me—Jane. 
Oh, my ! doesn't she, &c. 
You bet, here's what's de matter am, 
That's one who can greenbacks scatter em,-
And make young swells smile at her, am 
Dis same Miss Matilda Jane Brown. 
In de suburbs you'd think dat dis maiden dwelt, 
In a 
mansion ob brown stone her dad had built; 
But de old man, I've diskivir'd, boots and shoes 
does welt— 
In a 
one-story shanty down town. 
Oh, my I

SOME PUMPKINS. 
(Written by II. Angelo expressly for Frank Moran.) 
To keep pace with the present age, 
What folks must do I'll tell, 
'Ere they can be some pumpkins now 
And cut a 
heavy sw611 : 
Dame Fashion leads all by the nose, 
And makes us silly elves, 
Both high and low, when fixed, you know, 
Some pumpkins think themselves. 
Spoken.—Yes, that's a 
fact, if.we ain't we want 
to be  
Some pumpkins, now, some pumpkins, now, 
'Tis so, you'll all agree, 
Both high and low by outward show 
Some pumpkins strive to be. 
FRANR MORAN'S 
Don but a 
suit of clothes the best, 
The tailor though you beat ; 
It matters not, for it's the style, 
And raises you some feet. 
I 
doubt then if you'll know yourself 
When fixed up ' fore the glass ; 
Like everybody else around 
You'll for some pumpkins pass. 
Spoken— Yes, then you'll be looking around for 
some one to interview you, and make you of sonic 
account, because you're— 
Some pumpkins, now, & c. 
Our girls now days about the head, 
All pumpkins seem, they do ; 
Their chignons have quite mammoth grown, 
Believe me it is true. 
They'll powder, paint, and dress to kill, 
Regardless of the pelf, 
And when on promenade, each lass 
Some pumpkins thinks herself. 
Spoken.—Yes, and Oh, such airs, ' specially if 
she has new fixins on, ' cause why ? she's 
Some pumkins, now, & c. 
Our young gents, too, I 
think you'll find 
Are pumpkin-headed some ; 
Fast horses, gaming and champagne 
Their brains will overcome. 
All fashions' follies they'll adopt, 
Just like our girls d'ye see, 
And laughing stocks make of themselves, 
Some pumpkins great to be. 
Spoken— Yes, they imagine everybody they 
meet is in love with them, 'jist ' cause they look at 
'ern—you see, they're— 
Some pumpkins, now, & c. 
SONGSTER. 
We've pumpkins now of various kinds, 
Long, crooked, fiat and round ; 
But those, I 
sing to you about 
Amongst the flats arc found. 
Oft-times there lifted up so high , 
You're forced to think them some ; 
But soon they take the backward track 
And down ails quash they come. 
Spoken.— Yes, up a 
pumpkin,—down a 
squash. 
Some pumpkins, now, Sze. 
RAILWAY SPEED. 
Sung by Frank Moran. 
Air.—" Chapter of Accidents." 
To sing a 
song of railway speed, 
While here I 
do intend, sirs ; 
For over this ' ere mighty land 
We've railway tracks no end, sirs ; 
For carriages and horses, soon 
We shall have no need, sirs; 
But travel at our ease the globe, 
By means of railway speed, sirs 
Railway speed ! 
Where'er you range, 
There's naught so strange 
As Railway speed. 
Young ladies, when they fall in love, 
Long single will not tarry ; 
But, with the fastest railway speed, 
They urge their beaux to marry ; 
And when they wed, the pretty dears, 
Throughout our happy nation ; 
With railway speed their husbands urge 
On to propagation. 
Railway speed, 8:c. 
10 
FRANN MORAN'S 
When rich old uncle's fortunes leave; 
In fields so rich and level ; 
Their nephews wish with railway speed, 
, 
They'd travel to the d-1; 
And when they die, with decency 
They scarcely can behave, sirs ; 
But the morning train, and railway train, 
Quick bear him to the grave, sirs. 
Railway speed, &c. 
Now, when a 
friend is in distress, 
Let's think not of the distance ; 
But hasten on with railway speed 
To render him assistance. 
Remember, that at most there is 
A 
very little span, sirs, 
To enable man to prove that he 
The brother is to man, sirs. 
Railway speed, &c. 
The pills now everywhere in vogue, 
They say are never failing ; 
But sure to cure you in a 
trice 
Whatever is your ailing. 
And if you take a 
dose of them 
You'll find, you will, indeed, sirs, 
They'll set you trotting, you know where, 
And that with railway speed, sirs. 
Railway speed, & c. 
What is it we frequently say we'll do and not 
one has yet done ? 
Stop a 
minute. 
When is a 
toper's nose not a 
nose ? 
When it is 
a 
little reddish. 
When has a man four hands? 
When he 
doubles his fists.

PADDY IS THE BOY. 
As sung by Frank Moran, of Carncross & Dixey's Minstrels. 
It's some years ago, I 
very well know, 
Since I 
first saw daylight with my two blessed 
eyes; 
I 
was born, so they say, when my dad was 
away, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning; 
How they nursed me with joy, said what a 
fine 
boy, 
Put a 
stick in my fist, by the way of a 
toy; 
Faith! there's no mistake, they admired my 
make, 
And said, some day I'd give the girls a 
warming. 
Chorus.—For Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
glass, 
Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
lass, 
Dear old Dublin is the place for me, 
And Donnybrook is the place to go for 
a 
spree. 
At a 
wake or a 
fair, poor Paddy is there, 
He will fight foe or friend, if they do him offend; 
Let the piper strike up, he will rise from his cup 
With a 
smile on his face adorning ; 
With his little colleen, he will dance on the 
green, 
Sure an Irishman, there, in his glory is seen ; 
Play a 
reel or a 
jig, he don't care a 
fig, 
But he'll dance till daylight in the morning. 
For Paddy is the boy, & c. 
Now, boys, do ye mind, ye never will find 
Such a 
dear little place as the Emerald Isle. 
Long, long may it stand, and good luck to the 
land 
That dear old St. Patrick was born in ; 
12 
FRANK monAN's 
May the girls, young and old, may the boys, 
brave and bold, 
Unite heart and hand to protect the dear Isle, 
And morn, noon and night, may joy and delight 
Shine on them like a 
fine summer's morning. 
For Paddy is the boy, &c. 
MY SALLIE AM A CHARMER. 
Written by II. Angelo. Sung by Frank Moran at Carneross 
and Dixey's 11th Street Opera House. 
Air.—" Charlie is my Darling." 
My Sallie am a 
charmer, 
A charmer, a 
charmer, 
My Sallie am a 
charmer, 
If she ain't it's queer. 
She goes out promenading, 
Eb'ry day dat's clear, 
Den ' mong de belles and belgerines 
Quite gay does she appear. 
My Sallie am a 
charmer, &c. 
My Sallie am some pumpkins, 
Some pumpkins, some pumpkins, 
My Sallie am some pumpkins, 
I 
tell you all right here. 
She wears a 
great big chignon, 
And lots oh more head gear, 
And in all the fixin's fash'nable 
You'll see my Sallie dear. 
My Sallie am a 
charmer, & c. 
My Sallie am fixed hunkey, 
Fixed hunkey, fixed hunkey, 
My Sallie am fixed hunkey,

Her dad has some spondulix, 
A healthy pile, I 
heat I 
So stick to Sal I 
guess I 
shall, 
And call her ducky dear. 
My Sallie am a 
charmer, & c. 
De fortune-teller tells me, 
She tells me, she tells me, 
De fortune-teller tells me 
Our wedding day am near; 
I've smashed de heart of Sallie 
And she has mine ' tis clear ; 
So, boys, when Sal and I 
am spliced, 
You bet I'll stand de beer. 
My Sallie am a 
charmer, &c. 
As sung by Frank Moran. 
Words by H. Devine. 
0, white folks, now I'll sing to you 
About my Aunt Jemima; 
She used to make de best of plaster 
Down in old Carolina. 
Sheep skin, bees wax, 
'Gundy pitch and plaster, 
De more you try to pull it off 
De more it sticks de faster. 
Uncle Tom he caught a 
cold, 
I 
really don't know how, sirs ; 
They put the plaster on his head 
And drawcd him out his trowsers. 
Sheep skin, & c. 
Old massa had a 
stubborn horse, 
And wouldn't work, of course, sirs ; 
Dey put de plaster on his cart, 
And it pulled like any horse, sirs. 
Sheep skin, &e. 
14 
FRANK MORAN'S 
One morning I 
was awful hoarse, 
My voice was like a 
chicken's, 
So I 
put a 
plaster on my neck 
And it drawed me to de dickens. 
Sheep skin, & e. 
Brudder Bones was taken sick, 
I 
undertook de healing; 
I 
put de plaster on his crown 
And it drawed him through de ceiling. 
Sheep skin, & c. 
Aunt Jemima had a 
dog, 
Ms tail was rather stumpy, 
Dey put de plaster on his nose 
And it drawed him to a 
monkey. 
Sheep skin, & c. 
Aunt Jemima was taken sick, 
You may believe the story ; 
Dey put a 
plaster on her breast 
And it thawed her up to glory. 
Sheep skin, & c. 
SUNDAY DOWN THE HARBOR. 
Sung by Frank Moran. 
Air.—" Love Among the Roses. 
I 
took her down the harbor—my darling Arabella, 
That is, she were, but ain't no more, for she's got 
another feller. 
'Twas a week ago last Sunday, I 
invited her 
mother and her sister, 
'Cause I 
asked the old woman for to let Bell go, 
and she said, " I 
guess not, Mister !" 
'Twas just my luck—I 
always get stuck; 
l'm a 
poor unfortunate barber; 
But it was rough, you bet, enough, 
That Sunday down the harbor. 
SONGSTER. 
15 
I 
bought three quarts of peaches and all the lite-
rary papers, 
And we sailed along, though the wind was strong, 
and the sea kicked up his capers ; 
The boat she pitched and then she twitched, and I 
felt a 
getting yeller; 
The old woman, too, began to get blue, and so did 
Arabella. 
'Twas just my luck, & c. 
I 
leaned across the rail—and, of course, I 
didn't 
IVant to do it— 
Some fellers laughed and others chaffed, and told 
me to throw it; 
The wind was high, and it went in my eye, and 
some went up my smeller ; 
But again I 
threw, and away it blew, and it plas-
tered my Arabella. 
'Twas just my luck, & c. 
Then Bell she wiped her papier ; says she, " You 
sweet young pill, you."— 
Says she, " Now leave !" 
I fetched a 
heave. 
Says she, " Oh, take him off, will you I " 
Then along comes a 
nice. young feller, and he 
opens up his umbrella— 
Says he, " My dear, just come in here," and he 
took away my Arabella. 
'Twas just my luck, &c. 
I 
humbly begged her pardon, and tried to explain 
it to her mother ; 
But it wasn't 110 good— she give me no show— she 
went and loved another. 
My heart it's almost broken—I 
aint got DO Ara-
bella. 
She's let me drap for that nice young chap, a 
buss-
ing her behind his umbrella. 
'Twas just my luck, & c.

SHEW FLY" ON THE BRAIN. 
By Arthur W. French. 
Passing along, in daily life, 
We hear, both near and far, 
The people all, both great and small, 
Feel like a 
morning star ; 
The doctors have no magic pow'r 
This mania to chain, 
So all the folks are going wild 
With " Shew Fly " on the brain. 
Chorus--Passing along, in daily life, 
We hear them all complain, 
For everybody's troubled with 
This " Show Fly" on the brain. 
A friend meets you up on the street, 
Asks kindly how you are ; 
You clasp his hand and say you feel 
Just like a 
morning star ; 
The rich and poor, and high and low, 
The fancy and the vain, 
have gone quite mad, they have it bad, 
This " Shew Fly " on the brain. 
Passing along, &-e. 
The ladies, too, I 
hate to say, 
No matter where they are, 
If asked their health, they all exclaim :— 
Just like a 
morning star ; 
And urchins, too, have learnt the phrase— 
But I 
repeat again 
That people all, both great and small, 
Have " Shew Fly " on the brain. 
Passing along, &c. 
Deacons and mini'4ers of grace, 
And members of the bar, 
Officials all, both high and low, 
Feel like a 
morning star ;

Lawyers and judges of the courts 
Have tried, but all in vain, 
To ' scape the clasp, but have at last

SONG OF THE PRESENT TIME. 
As sung by Frank Moran. 
Air.—" Old English Gentleman." 
Oh, bow the world has alter'd since some sixty 
years ago, 
When boots and shoes would really serve to keep 
out rain and snow. 
But double soles and broad-cloth—dear me, bow 
very low 
To talk of such old-fashioned things when every 
one must know 
That we are well-bred gentlemen all of the present 
time. 
Young ladies, now, of sage sixteen, must give 
their friends a 
rout, 
And teach the cook and housemaid how to hand 
the things about ; 
And they must pull ma's bedstead down, and 
burry, scout and flout. 
To have a 
nice refreshment room and lay the sup-
per out, 
Like well-bred, dashing gentlefolks all 
of the 
present time. 
Your beardless boys, all brag and noise, must do 
the thing that's right ; 
That is, they'll drink champagne and punch, and 
keep it up all night ; 
(2*) 
' 
18 
FRANK MORAN'S 
They'll smoke and swear, ' till sallying forth at 
peep of morning light, 
They knock down some old woman just to show 
how well they fight, 
Like brave, young, we,l-brad gentlemen all of the 
present time. 
At the good old hours of twelve and one our 
grandsires used to dine 
And quaff their nut-brown ale and eat roast beef 
and chine ; 
But we must have our silver forks, ragouts and 
foreign wine, 
And not sit down till five or six, if we mean to 
cut a 
shine, 
Like dashing, well-bred gentlefolks 
all 
of the 
present time. 
Our daughters, now, at ten years old must learn to 
squall and strum, 
And study shakes and quavers under Signor 
Fe e-fo- fu m ; 
They'll play concertos, 
sing bravuras, 
rattle, 
scream and thrum 
Till you almost wish that you were deaf, or they, 
dear things, were dumb. 
But they must be like young gentlefolks all of the 
present time. 
Our sons must jabber Latin verbs and talk of a 
Greek root 
Before they've left off pinafores, cakes, lollipops 
and fruit. 
They all have splendid talents that the desk or bar 
would suit, 
Each darling boy would scorn to be a 
low me-
chanic brute ! 
They must be well-bred college youths all of the 
present time.

But bills will come at Christmas time, alas, a-lack-
a- day! 
The creditors may call again—' Papa's not in the 
way; 
He's out of town ; but, certainly, next week he'll 
call and pay.' 
And then his name is published, sure—and this, 
I 
mean to say, 
Oft' winds up many gentle- folks all of the present 
day. 
I'VE FOUND MY GIRL AT LAST. 
(Inserted by permission of C. F. Escher Sz Son, publishers of 
the music, 70 North Second Street, Philadelphia.) 
For thirty years I've lived alone, 
A 
victim of the fates ; 
I 
know a 
thousttud pretty girls 
In these United States. 
Yet there was something in them all 
That tailed to hold me fast ; 
But now I 
own my heart of stone 
Has found a 
girl at last, 
Oh ! 
Is'nt she a 
pretty girl, 
And don't she hold me fast ; 
Be not amazed if I 
am crazed, 
I've found my girl at last. 
Bell Snoozle, she was very fair, 
And there was black-eyed Sue-, 
And Polly Jones,—Oh ! bless her bones ; 
But none of them would do. 
I 
tell you they were jolly girls 
Of most exalted cast, 
And still my heart would never thump, 
But now Pm caught at last. 
Isn't she, 6:e. 
20 
FRANK MORAN'S 
The love I 
bear my Mollie dear, 
No mortal tongue can tell ; 
'Tis stronger far than Schwitzcr cheese, 
And louder than a 
bell. 
Those scented notes from other folks 
Are in the fire cast. 
Good-bye to girls and silken curls, 
For I 
am caught at last. 
Oh ! 
Isn't she, &c. 
Whenever Mollie writes to me, 
The mails are all insured ; 
Her letters burn the leather bag 
By which they are secured. 
No use to put them in the stove, 
They are so awful hot 
They'd burn the fire out the grate 
And boil the dinner pot. 
Oh ! 
Isn't she, & c. 
Why sugar is a 
vinegar 
When Mollie is around ; 
Her sweets perfume the very streets 
And fertilize the ground. 
Such hair and eyes—how they surprise— 
And that dear mouth I've kissed ; 
Don't blame me, for it is so big 
It never will be missed.

To say I

Five hundred karats fine.

To see that we are fast, 
And judging from appearances, 
I've found my girl at last.

TEDDY O'NEAL'S PARTY. 
As sung by Frank Moran. 
OCh I I sing of a 
rout at Killarney, 
'Twds given by Teddy O'Neal, sirs, 
A gentleman born without blarney, 
Whose calling was vastly genteel, sirs. 
Of a

With the ladies, sure, Ted bore the sway, sirs, 
And in business, joy, proving a 
thriver 
He kept his dear Kate's wedding clay, sirs. 
Whack fal tat de ral, &c. 
First came Leary the tinker and Judy, 
Who took mate for the butcher so handy, 
With Terrance O'Tool and Pat Moody, 
Whose legs looked as though they were 
bandy. 
Then with Murphy came Sally Macgee, 
With McDermot the piper so frisky, 
Who swore he wa'n't drunk, d'ye see, 
Though he'd swallow'd nine noggins of 
whiskey. 
'Whack fal tat, &e. 
Dinner ended, to mirth they gave way, 
And the tinker sung Margery Grinder, 
While Teddy's sweet rib swigged away 
At the " crature," till none could be blinder. 
O'Tool roared out Teddy O'Riley, 
Pat Moody sung sweet Ally Croaker, 
And ' cause Teddy kissed Judy so slily, 
Kate fetch'd him a 
rap with the poker.

Stools, tables and jugs flew about, 
All mirth was at a

BUT YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME IN 
THAT SORT OF WAY.

Air.—"Charraing Young Widow." 
0, girls, you may put on your diamonds and laces, 
And flower up your dresses and trimmings so 
gay, 
You may rub on the paint and powder your faces, 
But you'll never catch me in that sort of way. 
You may do up your hair each night in small 
pa pers, 
To make it " friz" nicely, and do as you say, 
"Cascade" it, and make it cut all sorts of capers, 
But you'll never catch me in that sort of way. 
With a 
book to your noses, to take a 
position 
Between the lace curtains " made up" for the 
day, 
And show your white hands in their jeweled con-
dition, 
But you'll never catch me in that sort of way; 
And when you observe that 1'm up the step 
coming, 
You twist yourself round to make a 
display, 
Or skip o'er the room and go straightway to 
" 
drumming," 
Ah ! 
you'll never catch me in that sort of way.

You may roll up your eyes with true affectation, 
And smile up your faces like bright morns in

How sweetly you try to secure admiration, 
But you'll never catch me in that sort. of way ; 
You may use unabridged, either '' Webster " or 
" 
Walker," 
And hope to win hearts by pedantic display, 
You may lack " common ." sense, yet be pretty 
talkers, 
But you'll never catch me in that sort of way. 
You may walk in the street, so dignified, queenly, 
And airish and stiff as the young popin-jay, 
You may scorn, in your pride, friends dressed 
perhaps meanly, 
But you'll never catch me it that sort of way. 
You may go to your churches to show those new 
dresses, 
And bow down your heads just pretending to 
pray. 
Don't think I 
believe that the prayer much im-
presses, 
For you'll never catch me in that sort of way ; 
You may turn up your noses at housework and 
cooking, 
(Two things little studied at this present day.) 
You may live week by week, those things over-
looking, 
But you'll never catch me in that sort of way ; 
You may lie in your bed till ten in the morning. 
You must— for you danced till the broad light 
of day;

again give you this little warning. 
That you'll never catch me in that sort of way.

Last night I

I'm going to tell ye about it, 
The misthress the table was spreading 
Wid whisky— they can't do widout it; 
A famous bagpiper was present, 
To give all the fellers a

What made the occasion more pleasant 
Was Padt"y, the great jig dancer. 
Kick up yer ships, every one of ye, 
Give the girls and boys a 
chance, sir; 
Shake up your brogans each mother's 
son of ye, 
For Paddy's the great jig dancer. 
There was Judy O'Flynn's second cousin, 
A

There was Devlins and Doyles by the dozen, 
And a

The couple were joined at midnight, 
The priest with his blessing departed,

From Paddy, the great jig dancer. 
Kick up yer shins, & c. 
The piper retired in a

Glad to get out of their clutches ; 
He lost all his wind in the flurry, 
And west home on a

The bride had a 
thousand warm kisses 
But none did completely entrance her 
Like the favorite boy of the misses, 
Bowld Paddy, the great jig dancer. 
Kick up yer shins, & c. 
The party broke up at daylight, 
The bridegroom reposed in the gutter,

TIM FINIGAN'S WAKE. 
As sung by Frank Moran, of Carncross & Dixey's Minstrels. 
Tim Finigan lived in Market street, 
A gentleman Irishman—mighty odd— 
He'd a 
beautiful brogue, so rich and sweet, 
And to rise in the world he carried the hod ; 
But you see he'd a 
sort of i 
tipling way : 
With a 
love for the liquor poor Tim was born 
And to help him through his work each clay, 
he'd a 
drop of the creature every morn. 
Whack, hurrah, blood and ' ounds, ye sowl ye, 
Welt the flure, ye're trotters shake ; 
Isn't it the truth l've told ye. 
Lots of fun at Finigan's wake. 
(3*) 
FnANK. MORAN'S 
One morning Tim was rather full, 
His head felt heavy which made him shake, 
lie fell from a 
ladder and broke his skull ; 
So they carried him home his corpse to wake ; 
They rolled him up in a 
nice clean sheet 
And laid him out upon the bed, 
With fourteen candles ' round his feet, 
And a 
couple of dozen around his head. 
Whack, hurrah, & c. 
His friends assembled at the wake, 
Missus Finigan called out for the lunch ; 
First they laid in tay and cake, 
Then pipes and tobacco and whisky punch. 
Miss Biddy O'Brien began to cry : 
Such a 
purty corpse did ever you see, 
Arrah, Tim, avourneen, and why did ye die ? 
Och, none of your gab, sez Judy Magee. 
Whack, hurrah, & c. 
Then Peggy O'Connor took up the job, 
Arrah, Biddy, says she, ye're wrong I'm sure ; 
But Judy then gave her a 
belt on the gob, 
It left her sprawling on the !lure. 
Each side in war did soon engage ; 
"[was woman to woman and man to man ; 
Shillaleh law was all the rage, 
And a 
bloody ruction so'on began. 
Whack, hurrah, & c. 
Mickey Mulvaney raised his head, 
When a 
gallon of whiskey flew at him. 
It missed him—and hopping on the bed, 
The liquor scattered over Tim. 
Bedad, he revives ! see how he raises. 
Are Timothy jumping from the bed, 
Cried, while he lathered around like blazus : 
Bad luck to yer sowl d'ye think I'm dead ?

KILKENNY CATS. 
Sang by Frank Moran of Carncross & Dixey's Minstrels. 
Air.—" Wearing of the Green." 
O'Flynn she was an Irishman, as very well was 
known, 
And she lived down by Kilkenny, and she lived 
there all alone, 
With only six great large Tom cats as knew their 
ways about; 
And everybody else besides she carefully shut out. 
Oh, very fond of cats was she, ( and whiskey, too, 
'tis said.) 
She didn't feed ' cm very much, but she combed 
'em well instead ; 
As may be guess'd the large Tom cats they didn't 
get very sleek 
Upon a 
combing once a 
day and a 
ha'porth once 
a 
week. 
Now, on one dreary winter's night, O'Flynn she 
went to bed ; 
The whiskey bottle ' neath her arm, ( the whiskey 
in her head.) 
The six great large Tom cats they sat all in a 
dis-
mal row, 
And horribly glared their hungry eyes—their tails 
wagged to and fro; 
At last one grey grimalkin spoke in accents dire 
to tell, 
And dreadful were the words which in his awful 
whisper fell— 
When all the other five Tom cats in answer loud 
did squall, 
" 
Let's kill her and let's eat her, body, bones and 
all !"

When the sun shone in the window hole, and all 
seemed still and well, 
The cats they sat and licked their paws all in a 
merry ring ; 
But nothing else within the place looked like a 
living thing; 
Anon they quarrelled savagely, and spit and swore 
and holleed, 
Till at last these six great Tom cats they one 
another swaller'd; 
And nought tut one long tail was left in that once 
peaceful dwelling; 
.And a 
very tough one, too, it was,— it's the same

Sung by Frank Moran. 
Air.—"Mistletoo Baugh." 
My grandmother's cat, ' pan my word it is true 
Bit the end of her tail, and run up the flue; 
My grandmother took off the specks froxi her 
eyes, 
Stood still for an hour, and stared with surprise. 
And all of us wonder'd, who sat in a 
row, 
Where the dickens my grandmother's cat could 
go. 
'Twos a beautiful Tom, ' round the country for 
miles 
My grandmother's cat was the pride of the Tiles. 
Oh, my grandmother's cat ! 
Oh, my grandmother's cat ! 
SONGSTER. 
41 
It was for the old lady a 
terrible day— 
She wept and she cough'd, and she fainted away; 
And so she kept on for a 
number of years 
Till at length the old lady was drowri'd in her 
tears. 
Tom was sought in the highest, the lowliest spot, 
The oven, the grate, and the ehimbeley pot ; 
I 
sought him for years, until every brat 
Cried, " there he goes arter his grandmother's 
cat." 
Oh, my grandmother's cat, &c. 
Ten years pass'd away-, 
nd every night 
Would a 
terrible clream 
ut me in a 
sad fright, 
'Till at last I 
looked where the griiia vision said, 
And found Torn llatten'd out at the head of my 
bed; 
Right under my pillow—there's truth 
in my 
rhyme— 
Which show'd my bed had'nt been made all that 
time. 
Than a pancake there never was nothing more 
flat, 
And here's the remains of my grandmother's cat. 
Oh, my grandmother's eat, & c. 
All you who may have a 
Tom cat for a 
pet, 
Into a 
like muss may you, none of you get ; 
For should it be black, you may certainly know, 
lip the flue, in the dark, you can't well see it go. 
If to stop safe at home, on your pet you'd prevail, 
Never let your Tom cat bite the end of his tail ; 
Only think of the sad things attending on that, 
And the mortal remains of my grandmother's cat. 
Oh, my grandmother's eat, &e. 
What poet was never troubled with 
bills?

MURPHY DELA.NEY. 
A , sung by F..attic I1L)ran. 
It was Murphy Delaney, so funny and frisky, 
Reeled in a 
shebeen shop to ga his skin full; 
And reeled out again 
pretty well lined with 
whiskey, 
As fresh as a 
shamrock, and blind as a 
bull ; 
When a 
trilling accident happened our rover, 
Who took the quay side for the floor of his shed, 
And the keel of a 
coal- barge he tumbled over 
And thought all the time he was goi::.g to bed. 
And sing fillaloo, hublmboo. whack, botheration, 
Every man to his humor, as Kate -kis.-

Who swore that poor Pat was no longer a 
liver, 
But dead as the devil, and there was an end. 
They sent for the coroner's jury to try him ; 
But Pat not much liking this comical strife, 
Fell to twisting and turning the while they sat by 
him, 
And came (when he found it convenient ) to life. 
And sing fillaloo, &c. 
Says Pat to the jury*: " Your worships,

I 
don't think I'm dead, so what is it you do ?" 
"Not dead ! " says the foreman, " ye spalpeen be 
aisy; 
Don't you think the doctor knows, better than 
YOU p 
So then they went on with the business further, 
Examined the doctor about his belief; 
When4they brought poor Delaney in guilty of 
murder, 
And swore they would hang him in spite of his 
teeth.

Then Paddy laid hold of a 
clumsy shelialeb, 
And laid on the doctor, who, as stiff as a 
post, 
Still swore that he couldn't be Murphy Delaney, 
But something alive, and so must be a 
ghost. 
Then the jury began, but with fear to survey him 
(Whilst he like a 
devil about him did lay,) 
And sent straight out of hand for the clergy to lay 
him ; 
But Pat laid the clargy, and then ran away_

HOW PADDY PUT A WEEK IN.

by Frank Morau. 
One Monday Pat from bed did pop, 
His heart was light and frisky, 
So he went off to Reilly's shop 
To get a 
sup of whiskey. 
He gave him one, he drank one, too, 
When in popp'd Ted, his cousin, 
Who called for a 
bowl of Reilly's punch, 
And they sat till they drank a 
dozen. 
For that's the way to spend a 
day, 
Or a 
week, if you'd be frisky ; 
And wrong or right, or day or night, 
Och ! Paddy will have his whiskey. 
SONGSTER. 
45 
On Tuesday how his head did ache, 
When in pop'd Phil Macarthy, 
Who said he called for friendship's sake, 
To see if Paddy was hearty. 
Says Pat, " I'm not—the whiskey-shop 
Beat me last night— so come, Mac, 
For if to-day my shirt I 
pop, 
By the powers, I 
must settle my stomach." 
And that's the way, ttc. 
While Reilly passed the broth about, 
Said the mistress, " Lord ! how them men stay." 
So Reilly declared he would tumble them out; 
But they swore they'd remain till Wednesday. 
And so they did, till Wednesday night, 
When the landlady's tongue went faster ; 
So her husband's bead they cut in a 
fight, 
And next morning they gave him a 
plaster. 
For that's the way, &c. 
On Thursday came the making up ; 
And sure it was a 
high day, 
And many a 
tear and many a 
cup 
Were spilt, ' till in came Friday. 
But, being tired, and very weak, 
And the devil Care still scorning 
They snored away, and ne'er did speak 
One word till Saturday morning. 
Then that's the way, &-,
e. 
But, stiff and sore, they woke once more 
And knew of the week they'd but one day ; 
So they did swear to continue there, 
And be ready for mass on Sunday. 
That's the way young Pat put in the week. 
Do you think it bard work or enjoyment ? 
Either one or the other 
I'll thank you to speak 
No ill of poor Paddy's employment. 
For that's the way, & e.

THE FINE YOUNG CODFISH GENTLEMAN. 
As Sung by Frank Moran. 
Air—" Old English Gentleman" 
Now open the piano and a 
ballad I 
will sing 
Of a 
fine young codfish gentleman who goes it like 
a 
king; 
Who is posted on the attitudes and carves a 
festive 
swell, 
And who, though he never does anything but 
strut, dress, gas and idle round town, talks as 
if he were genius enough to do anything from 
improving the original plan of the Creation 
down to keeping a 
hotel; 
This 
fine 
young codfish 
gentleman all in the 
snobby line. 
This fine young man, while single, adores a 
fast 
French play, 
And on wigg'd and painted dancing-girls 
his 
thousands throws away. 
In flitting'round their fly-blown charms he shows 
a 
wond'rous art, 
And if he succeeds after spending a 
thousand or 
more dollars in coming in as the eleven hun-
(heti' happy man, he is so uncommonly proud 
of the occurrence that he wouldn't object to 
having the fact printed on a 
red hand-bill and 
carried through the streets in a 
cart. 
This fine young codfish gentleman all in the crin-
oline. 
48 
FRANK MORAN'S 
Like other folks, this codfish is liable to ills;. 
Such as wanting to buy more than he can pay for, 
which he cures by making bills ; 
And don't object to sticking grocers, brokers, 
painters, upholsterers, tailors, 
livery-stable-
men, and, in fact, almost everybody far and 
wide; 
And when his governor gets the hills and asks in 
horror, " What is to be done ?" he replies in 
a 
very indifferent manner, " Oh, dern 
let ' em slide I" 
This fine young codfish gentleman all in the swin-
dling line. 
Now, when his wild oats all are sown, he gets 
himself a 
wife, 
And starts, in one of our most fashionable up-town 
streets, or somewhere ' round where there's 
brown- stone or marble fronts, a 
different sort 
of life, 
And comes out with a 
four-horse carriage and a 
two- thousand jackass party on the fashion and 
"genteel;" 
And gets, in the course of time, from being very 
extraneously independent to be so magnori-
ously humble and politeful that if anything 
which looks like a 
real title come along he 
goes down bang on his knees before it, with 
the whole family, Mrs. Codfish included, and 
they have a 
high old kneel, 
This fine young codfish gentleman all in the hum-
ble line. 
At length it comes, in course of time, as to all the 
world it must, 
The codfish runs his line all out and has to die or 
bu8t, 
So he slings himself loose on Wall street, and 
maybe gets in—as there's nothing like a 
fool 
for luck,— on a 
pretty paying train ; 
SON GSTER. 
49 
Or else he makes a 
big raise and puts for Europe, 
where he liVCS four or five years 'till a 
rich 
relation dies, rip, snap, and sets him up again. 
This fine young codfish gentleman when he plays 
out his line.

And her little dinner- plate chapeau 
Down slanting o'er her eyes.

Just resting on a

And down slanting o'er her eyes.

It's 0! her bully glance; 
And 0 ! dat howling style ob dress,

And dreadful am my sighs 
O'er dat fire plug and dinner plate 
Just slidin' o'er her eyes.

THE BURIAL OF SIR THOMAS KITTEN. 
As sung by Frank Moran, of Carncross & Dixey's Minstrels. 
Not a 
me-yow was heard nor a 
feline note, 
As his corpse to the barn-yard they hurried; 
Not a 
groan came forth from a 
mouser's throat, 
At the grave where the kitten they buried. 
They buried him quickly toward morning light, 
The earth with their paws a-turning— 
With never a 
ray of the moon's pale light, 
Or ever a 
lantern a-burning. 
His paws were folded across his breast, 
His tail it was twisted around him ;\ 
And he lay like a 
tom cat taking ,his rest 
With cats and kittens—confound him; 
Not a 
tear was dropped, not a 
prayer was said, 
Not even a 
word of sorrow, 
But they thought, when they gazed on the face 
of the dead, 
Of the fights they would have on the morrow. 
They thought when they hollowed his narrow 
bed, 
Without giving him ever a 
pillow; 
That many a 
row would be had o'er the head 
Of the long-tailed kitten—poor fellow ; 
And foes may talk light of the kitten that's gone, 
And through the dull earth try to scratch him, 
But never-a- once, if they let him sleep on, 
Above the green sward will they catch him. 
The whole of their heavy task was done, 
When a 
cock crowed the hour of sunrising, 
And the way they took to their heels and run, 
I 
tell you, ' twas truly surprising. 
Not a 
me-yow was heard, nor a 
feline note, 
As his corpse to the barn-yard they hurried, 
Not a 
groan came forth from a 
mouser's throat, 
At the grave where the kitten they buried,

YOU KNOW HOW IT IS YOURSELF. 
As sung by Frank Moran. 
A new by-word we so often hear, 
In use among the high and low; 
But among the folks both far and near, 
There's one that now is all the go.

Now are laid upon the shelf; 
The one that has come out much later, 
is, " you know how it is yourself."

If you meet a 
man no more, he'll ask you 
What's the news, or how's your health ; 
But says, how does the old thing work, 
Why, you know how it is yourself. 
A young mechanic falls in love, 
The gal belongs to the upper ten ; 
She tells him for to ask her pa, 
As he's one of our solid men. 
He does propose ; the answer's no, 
My daughter marries a 
man of wealth 
You may be honest but you are poor, 
And you know how it is yourself. 
If you meet, &c. 
A married man, he stays out late, 
Among the boys, of course, he'll go, 
Enjoying himself then quite elate, 
Comes staggering home, how come you so ? 
His wife she cries and bellows out,

FRANK MORAN'S SONG OF 
CONUNDRUMS. 
Air.—" Things I 
don't like to see." 
Good folks, your attention awhile I'll engage, 
For puzzles and riddles are now all the rage ; 
And to be out of the fashion, you all must agree, 
You'd better be out of the woild, do you see ? 
I've been teasing my brains, just to search out a 
few 
Fresh conundrums, in hopes that my jokes will

The height of my wishes to gain your applause.

One is hard to get up, the other

And the boat should upset, and should leave the

But the reason they do I 
could never remark; 
I 
know very well I 
have got a 
good sight, 
But I

Because they eat lights. 
I've been teasing, & c. 
I've just got one more that I 
think you'll approve, 
The gout is a 
pain that none of us love; 
Pray, why is a

Air.—" Irish Legacy." 
In a 
mansion near Donegal's ancient new town, 
fooralaloo, fooralaloo, 
Lived my father and mother, two men of renown, 
Fal de ral, lid de ral, 1111., 
ra. 
I 
was their only boy, save a 
girl, by-the-bye, 
Who was heir to their wealth, and joint heiress 
was I, 
Fooralaloo, fooralaloo, 
°eh ! hone, gramaaree, whack ! 
Dad had a 
young sister, a 
crabbed old prude, 
Fooralaloo, & c. 
(Who ne'er could get wed, ' cause she never w'as 
wooed,) 
Fal de ral, &c. 
Who'd boast she was kin, in a 
double degree, 
Being aunt to my sister and uncle to me. 
Fooralaloo, 
Our mansion of clay was most dirtily clean, 
Fooralaloo, & c. 
In the midst of a 
wood, not a 
tree to be seen ; 
FA de ral, 
A 
spalpeen of a 
storm, our good fortune to crown, 
Blew up the whole fabric by blowing it down. 
Fooralaloo, & c. 
A 
blunder my parents then made must be known, 
Fooralaloo, & c. 
In stealing some cattle which were not their own; 
Fal de ral, & c. 
That exalted them up to great glory, you see, 
Both together, alone, on a 
leafless green tree. 
Fooralaloo, & c. 
SONGSTER.

Their sister soon died by hard drinking one day, 
Fooralaloo, &c. 
His niece quickly followed by showing the way, 
Pal de ml, & c. 
So they gave me the slip, and I'm now left alone 
To follow their fortunes, by making my own.

WHY DON'T THE GIRLS PROPOSE. 
Sun
, by Frank Moran, of Carucross & Dixey's 
The men are shy— the ladies cry, 
Their minds they won't disclose, 
If it be so, I 
like to know 
Why don't the girls propose. 
At splended balls, in dazzling halls, 
Amid a 
host of beaux ; 
With speaking eyes and well-timed sighs 
The ladies might propose. 
(Repeat ,first four lines for chorus.) 
Ye maidens fair, now laughing there 
So coyly with you beaux, 
Take my advice—don't be o'er nice, 
They'll wed— if you'll propose ; 
When stern papa's and cross mamma's 
All marriage schemes oppose, 
And beaux are shy, there's no cause why 
The belles should not propose. 
The men are shy, & c. 
Poor Martha Mears for forty years 
To wedlock was opposed ; 
But, now she sighs, and whimpering cries 
' 
I 
wish I 
had proposed." 
Then pity take, for hymen's sake, 
On those unhappy beaux, 
Who are, poor elves, too shy themselves 
A marriage to propose. 
The men are shy, & c.

THIS CORN UPON MY TOE. 
[From the Philadelphia Sunday Mercury.] 
BY GUESS WII0 I AM 
I 
have a 
very handsome foot, 
As you can plainly see, 
And all the pretty girls in town 
Are glad to squint at me; 
But there is something like a 
rock, 
That makes me cry out— oh, 
It is a 
nasty, ugly thing, 
A 
corn upou my toe. 
Spoken.— Anybody know a 
tip-top corn doctor 
If anybody does, send him along, for— 
Chorus.—My corn's a 
nasty, ugly thing, 
And makes me "holler" oh !— 
It never suits a 
fancy hoot, 
4 
This corn upon my toe. 
Last night I 
danced a 
pigeon wing 
With Lucy Anne Smudge; 
1 
thought a 
knife was in my foot, 
Whenever 1 
would budge. 
I 
smiled and threw my legs about.. 
Half dead to " holler," oh,— 
In this dilemma, Lady Smudge 
Came dancing on my toe. 
Spoken.—First—Then you suffered. 
Second—Most fainted. Said I 
must go 
out. 
Mother rants me. " Where is 
your mother ?" said she. 
Said I, " 
hope she's outside with a 
box of salve 
for :" 
My corn's, &c. 
The other day I 
took a 
car 
To ride to Manayunk ; 
A 
big, fat women lugged along 
A band-box and a 
trunk. 
SONGSTER. 
Some six or seven hundred weight 
Soon made me hollow" oh, 
For it came smashing in my corn, 
This corn upon my toe. 
Spoken.—First— .What did you say ? 
Second— A feller finds a 
lot to say. 
Madam, quoth I. 
I 
have no objection 
to you personally, but please remove 
the band-box and trunk, for 
My corn's, &c. 
One time I 
stood before the glass 
To practice on a 
smile; 
I 
promised Sal a 
photgraph— 
One of the killing style ; 
TLe operator fixed my head, 
And trod upon my toe ; 
And when the photographs were done, 
They all were crying oh, 
Spoken.—First—Look here, that's a 
lie. 
Second— Tell 
you it 
isn't. 
Every 
photograph hollered oh! It busted the 
artist. 
Folks 
said 
the 
house was. 
haunted. 
But I 
was about to remark 
that— 
My corn's, &c. 
The girls now say, " poor man he's lame, 
Why don't he buy a 
crutch ?" 
The boys all hollow out, " tight boots!" 
And that gets up my Dutch. 
I 
went to church, on Sunday week, 
But had to scream out oh! 
The deacon said—" lie's brought to feel !" 
Said I—" Yes, round the toe." 
Spoken.—First— It must be terrible. 
Second— Sir, it is exterminating. 
I'd 
rather 
ride an 
earthquake to the 
gallows, for 
My corn's, &c. 
'62 
FRANK 310DAN'S 
I 
have a 
question I 
would ask, 
While feeling so forlorn; 
Where is a 
dentist who can pull 
These teeth from out my corn ? 
They're biting harder than before ! 
I 
feel them now—Oil ! oh 1 
I'd rather have ten crocodiles 
All nibbling at my toe. 
Spoken,. — First—As bad as that ? 
Second—Yes, 
sir. 
I'd 
rather 
be 
" 
chawed " up by a 
whole menagarie, 
for--
My corn's, & c. 
MURDOCK McL MIEN AND MOLLY M'GEE. 
As Sang by Frank Moran. 
Air.—" Darling Oald Stick." 
Come lend your attention and listen awhile, 
If you all fall to laughing, you've no need to 
smile. 
Then sit quiet, my hearts, and a 
story I'll tell 
Of a 
rale Irish Scotchman who lived at the bell ; 
And his name was Murdock McLaren, 
From the bogs of braw Scotland so barren; 
All his love how lie fain would be sharing 
With lovely Miss Molly M'Gee. 
With the bag- pipe so nately concealed in his plaid, 
With two bottles of whiskey to govern his head ; 
With no shoes on his feet, but his bonnet so red, 
Faith, he rose up one morning without going to 
bed. 
And his heart in his bosom so loving, 
his courage like Highlanders' proving; 
He presently set off a 
roving 
In search of Miss Molly M'Gee. 
SONGSTER. 
63 
Now Miss Molly M'Gee you might quickly descry, 
She had no teeth in her head, but two specks in 
her eye ; 
She'd a 
hump on her back, and her nose stood 
awry, 
If she said she'd walk straight her legs gave her 
the lie. 
But when she saw Murdick McLaren, 
Her senses they all fell a 
jarring ; 
She thought him a 
jewel worth wearing 
And welcome to Molly M'Gee. 
When he showed her the bag-pipe just under his 
vest, 
She asked for a 
tune and he felt himself blest ; 
He played her a 
tune, and she thought it no jest, 
But when she'd heard one she would have all the 
rest : 
For the bag- pipe so wonderful charming, 
As yet, I 
could never find harm in ; 
My heart in my bosom ' tis warming 
Cried lovely Miss Molly M'Gee. 
When his tuning was ended he fain would give 
o'er, 
But she would not consent till he played it once 
more ; 
He played all his tunes, full in number a 
score, 
Till he thought sweet Miss Molly a 
wonderful 
bore; 
But as the next morning was breaking 
To a 
church his sweetheart was taking ; 
So success to the night's blanket shaking 
With Murdock and Molly M'Gee. 
When is a 
white man a 
darkie ? 
When he's a 
black- in his shoes. 
What is 
the greatest bet ever made ? 
The 
Alpha- bet.

FRANK MORAN'S 
LOVE IN A TUB. 
Air.—" Fly not yet." 
I've heard certain folks, with a 
shake and a 
start, 
sing " Love in the eyes," and " Love in the 
heart," 
And " Love among roses," which surely one's 
nose is 
Most likely to scratch ;—so to vary the catch 
I'll sing you, " Love in a 
tub." 
Mister Timkins, a 
tanner of wealth and renown, 
Iind a (laughter, Miss Jenny, the toast of the town. 
Among the gay sparks that paid court to the maid, 
Was a 
spruce little tailoring dandified blade, 
Mister Timothy Popinjay Sprig. 
At her window one night, by the light of the moon, 
With his heart, and his voice, and his fiddle in 
tune, 
On a 
water-butt perch'd, to be nearer his Miss, 
To whisper his vows, and to steal a 
sly kiss, 
And warble a 
soft serenade. 
" 
Oh, charming Miss Timkins ! to gain your fair 
hand, 
.I flatter myself, on my merit I 
stand ; "  
When, as he looked knowing, and cocked up his 
chin, 
Why, all of a 
sudden the kiver fell in ! 
And plump he popp'd into the tub. 
Miss Jenny laugh'd loud when her lover was 
foord, 
Mister Poppinjay's passion was presently cooled ; 
The water, so cold, put his love to the rout, 
'Twas love in a 
tub and the bottom fell out, 
That moment the kiver fell in. 
MORAL. 
Let each lover learn from the comical rig, 
That happened to Timothy Poppinjay Sprig 
When, in courting a 
lady the question he puts, 
Not to stand like poor Tim, on his ifs and his buts, 
Or his love may get cool'd in a 
tub. 
THE FROG POND. 
As Sung by Frank Moran, of Carneross & Dixey's Minstrels,. 
Air.—" Bow, wow- wow." 
This world is but a 
frog pond, 
I 
think without a 
joke, sirs ; 
Where frogs of every species come, 
To swim about and croak, sirs, 
They kick and splash through pond and marsh, 
To get their share of snacks, sir ; 
Until death comes a 
frog fishing 
And turns them on their back, sirs. 
Croak, croak, croak, 
This world is but a 
frog pond, croak, croak, croak. 
The statesman is a 
tree frog, upon the tree of 
state, sirs, 
his coat 
turns 
like the party 
limb, where 
interest await, sirs : 
And if the shower of success before him spreads 
her cloud, sirs, 
He swells himself on party's tree, and gayly 
croaks aloud, sirs. 
Croak, croak, croak, &-e. 
The lawyer is a 
marsh frog, he croaks, but for 
his fob, sirs, 
Upon some mossy bank he sits, awaiting for a 
job, 
sirs ; 
But if you chance to want his aid, and come 
without the pelf, sirs, 
he'll quickly leap into the stream and let you 
croak yourself, sirs.

OLD MR. AND YOUNG MRS. TRIM. 
Air.—" Cork Leg." 
As you've called upon me to give you a 
song, 
I'll sing you a 
queer one that's not very long ; 
About an old husband, and young Mrs. Trim, 
A. vixen, that very oft' quarreled with him. 
Ri tu ri In, &c. 
'Twas one Sunday morning, when all but great 
sinners, 
Mese people 
were talking of cooking 
their 
dinners ; 
Says he, I'll have roast, and I 
will not be foiled, 
Says she, but you shall, for the leg will be boiled. 
Ri tu ri In, &c. 
soNosTEn. 
67 
They then got to blows and made quite an uproarl 
Which disturbed a 
gent living upon the first floor, 
Who down stairs did run, and first did begin 
With words, but 
soon 
after knocked down 
Mr Trim. 
Ri tu ri In, &c. 
When Mrs. Trim saw her old husband used so, 
With the fat leg of motton she hit Brown a 
blow, 
Saying, " What's that to you if Tim quarrels 
with I?" 
Then she hit him another hard thump in the eye. 
Ri tu ri In, & c. 
Says Brown, I'll be hanged if I 
meddle again, 
For I 
get naught but grease and a 
great deal of 
P11 ; 
So husbands and wives they may fight if they will, 
All I'll say will be that they may tight away still.

Gracy was vulgar and Hannah was sad, 
Jennie was bandy and Laura cut capers, 
And Lucy I

There was Mary, and Martha, and Maggie, all 
jealous, 
Nancy was tame, and poor Pauline was wild; 
There was Rosy and Sallie, to wed me was jealous,
