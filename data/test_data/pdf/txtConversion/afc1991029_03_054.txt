 Ms.  Gendreau  is  a high  school  teacher  at  the  A.M.
 
Sormany Cites des Jeunes, the secondary school for Francophones in

Maillet.
 She invited us to come to her home for a lesson in making
 
croquexignol, a traditional fried pastry.
 That process is a part
 
of this tape,  but the conversation covers a wide range of topics.
 
During our visit,  Ms.  Julie Albert,  Ms.  Gendreau's mother,  joins
 
the conversation.  However, Ms. Albert did not wish to be taped, so
 
the recorder was shut off for parts of the visit.
