PORT ARANSAS FEB 8 P.M. 1939

Consider Greene's letter as possible publicity for the Folk Song Archive—if you think best?
file Port Aransas, Texas 2/7/ 19 39
Dear Mr. Spivacke:
I am asking Mr. Greene to wire you for any concessions about the Negro folk song
material. It is a matter of relief to me that the records are by now back in your hands.
Hereafter, for any reason, you may feel sure that I shall not again make a similar request
of you. Would you please send Mr. Greene's letter up for Mr. Putnam's reading? He heard
from your predecessor in office so many over aspersions on my persistance in recording
Negro music (as well as on any other possibly damaging angle)that I should like for Mr.
Putnam to see what Mr. Greene has to say. I think, also, that this letter should remain in
your files as an answer to critics who may be telling you of my manifest and confessed
short-comings.
In this connection, may I say again that I expect you to object now to any phase of the
collecting trip that I have outlined to you that does not meet with your approval? And,
Library of Congress

disregarding my suggestion, please feel free to make your own directions about what you
2 think I should do. You must get into your head that at least one of my faults is not an
overplus(?) of ego, that I know it all, that I do not confess to many gross blunders, due to
ignorance, inexperience or sheer stupidity—all equally blamable. You can speak your mind
to me. I'll welcome any suggestions.
Last week I made a 500 mile preliminary trip down to the Rio Grande on my own expense,
locating sources and starting at least half a dozen people to lining up singers for me. At
any other place I plan to stop on my way to Washington (as I wrote to you briefly from
Houston) I known whom I should see and, in each case, some of the material I expect to
find. Alan Lomax has written at length what his ideas are. Some of his directions I shall
follow; some I shall not.
With kind regards, I am Always sincerely John A. Lomax
