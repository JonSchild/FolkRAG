later on the frost was there and we didn't see nothing but little bitty footprints all over that
truck. And we went out hunting for it and we got out our bloodhound and he went hunting
for it and guess where we found it? We found it plum up there on Hunnington Road. And
man, that was the longest camping trip I ever went on and we was about to go home the
next morning.
FW: Virgil, do you remember of ever playing a trick on someone or having someone ever
play a trick on you?
INF: Oh lordy yes. There's this guy and he forgot, well he got me mad one time because
he started pushing my brother around. Well that was just too much for me cause' he was
smaller than him. Well I got up there in these woods, me and my brother, and he was
riding his Honda bike motorcycle, Honda 75, and we'd get a string and we'd tie it across
the road and we'd let it down and when he started coming we jerked it up. And man, it
knocked him plum off that bike. It didn't do nothing to the bike but he got messed up kinda
bad. But he never found out who it was and I'm not going to tell him either.

"Look at the Whitey," and I'd say, "Look at the Chocolate Man!" And he come back and
he says, "What did you say?" And I got "Chocolate Man, Chocolate Man." And he saya,
"What are you doing calling me a Chocolate Man?" And I go, "You call me a Whitey!" And
I go, "Really I ought to call you a Blackie." And he goes, "Can you outrace me?" And I go,

his shoes and he says, "Tie that shoe back." And I tied his two shoes togeather and he
started to take off and he fell flat on his face. And I beat him alright. I took off and I headed
for my car. That was over there in Princeton.
FW: Do you remember ever playing any other trickts on somebody?
INF: Yeah.
FW: What was that?
INF: The pocketbook trick.
FW: How do you play that pocketbook trick?
INF: Well I'd get beside the road there and I'd get a pocketbook and sit there and I'd get
some ah, fake money and let it kinda stick out. And I wouldn't let the one's, the number
ones and all that show, but I'd just let the green show. And there's this person that'd come
by and I'd get

INF(contd.): across this pit with a fishing rod hooked to the pocketbook. Each time he
started to grab for it, I'd pull it on in some more. Well, I kept on pulling until he started to
come across the pit. Well I covered it up and finally the pocketbook case across it and he
tried to reach for it and he took another step and man, he wound up right inside that pit.
There's was mud and water and everything there.

can push the compressor button. And she pushed the compressor button first by accident
and it attracted sharks all around the house and they'd punch a well, hole in it if they got
mad enough and ran into it. Well, she, the sharks did arrive and her husband had to go out
there in a skindiving suit and get a whole lot of blood and scatter it out towards away from
the house. Well the sharks went away but they come back for more. Well there's these
dolphins, play dolphins that that man made friends with while he was building the house.

that it went to the Pentagon and man, they just sent scuba divers and everything down
there. They, man, they was ready. They aimed every bomb they had at that place there.
Then here comes those scuba divers inside the house and all. And man, they was so
astonished! Woo! Man they was so, well all I can say that they was just mad cause they
made a fool of theirselves by even sending it all the way to the pentagon.
