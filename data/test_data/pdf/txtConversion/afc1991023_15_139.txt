OK, here we go. 
Today I drove south to Tuckerton and 
south on Rte. 9 to Dorofee Glassworks (about 7 miles south of 
Tuckerton on Rte. 9). G—New Gretna; 15GT 
Michael Dorofee was not 
there. His shop 
is open from 12-4 on Wed., Thurs., and Friday 
(I 
don't know about the weekends. 
Very interesting collection 
of house and sheds, two with cupolas, as well 
as a wooden booth 
of some sort. 
About 5 structures in all, many of which look like 
Dorofee must have had a hand in their construction. 
Blown glass 
Christmas tree ornaments in 
the window of the shop. 
I will 
go 
back next Thursday with the introduction of the neighbors, Armand 
and Pamela Carney. 
The Carneys live next door to Durofee and 
have a decoy and carved birds business. 
Armand had been a carver 
on a full time professional basis for fourteen years. 
Pamela's 
maiden name is Mathis, and she 
is a descendant of Great John 
Mathis. 
She still calls the town Mathistown instead of New 
Gretna because that was 
its original name. 
While the Carneys did 
not have time today to talk for a long time, they did touch on a 
number of interesting topics that we will discuss at length next 
week. 
One of these topics was the definition of Piney, and the 
definition of Clamdigger. 
Armand is the former and Pamela the 
latter. 
Pamela said she and her friends used to call Pineys 
Stumpjumpers. 
Piney was a derogatory term, they said, and 
referred to the early inhabitants of the Pines, not those who 
have migrated there 
in the last thirty years. 
People from New 
Gretna used to be called Herring or Heron towners, after which 
they were not sure. 
The Carneys also had their own ideas concerning the origin 
of the Jersey Devil. They think the devil was named after the 
eyes of the great horned owl, which glow red 
like coals 
(charcoal?). 
Many great horned owls used to inhabit the area and 
drive red tailed hawks from their nests. 
They are quite fierce 
birds, and they decapitate the Carneys bantams occasionally. 
The Carneys feel the Pinelands have already been raped and 
cited many examples in Tuckerton of the razing of historic

G—Chatsworth; 27GT 
The job was 
about two thirds complete. 
As 
it turned out Harvey Webb and his 
father did the work last, year, and Harvey has been collecting 
stones throughout the year whenever he sees stones that he 
likes, 
often while he 
is operating heavy earth moving equipment on his 
construction job. 
The house 
is structurally a log cabin with 
aluminum clapboard siding on the other three sides. 
Harvey's job 
also provides him 
with topsoil for landscaping his yard, and he 
transplants young birch bushes from the woods to his lawn where 
he 
lets them grow until they become too large, about ten feet or 
so. He has many plans for the design of his land, e.g., he 
is 
currently working on levelling his driveway with gravel from the 
town pit. 
Harvey's parents live next door; all 
the Webbs were 
interviewed by Carl and Christine.

TXO1: Today I would like to discuss four issues relating to an 
interview with Cliff Frazee. 
The first is a description of his 
workday cutting cedar in a swamp he owns near the G-North Branch; 
49GT. 
It 
is a 60 acre piece of 
land. 
Cliff's day begins at 
6:30am. 
He drives his truck over to his son's house about 5 
miles away, still 
in G-Forked River; 49GT. 
His son Steve has a 24 
acre piece of 
land at the end of a dead end road. 
On that site 
he has built an A-frame house and numerous outbuildings, which 
house cedar that has been milled at their mill, and vehicles used 
in their lumber business. 
Today Steve, Cliff's son who 
is 35, 
met us at the outbuilding that houses the 41 year old truck they 
use to haul 
logs from the swamp to the mill. 
We drove out to the cedar swamp, which 
is about 6 miles from 
Steve's house, and arrived about 7:30. 
Work began immediately. 
We backed the trucks down the corduroy road Cliff and his son 
built to the end of 
it where logs out on their last workday were 
lying. 
Cliff immediately manned the winch controls while Steve 
wrapped the hooked end of the wire cable around usually three 8-
inch diameter trees at a time. 
The cable would be wrapped once 
around and hooked to 
itself first at the end of the logs nearest 
the truck. 
This location was used to hoist the logs at an angle 
upwards until one end sat on the truck bed. 
Then the hoist 
cable, winch cable, was moved to the center of the logs, and 
Cliff maneuvered the logs until they were above the truck and 
parallel to its bed. 
The butt (base) end of the 
logs had to be 
toward the cab of the truck, so 
in many cases Steve had to turn 
the 
logs around end for end before Cliff lowered them with the 
winch onto the bed of the truck. 
Sets of the thinnest logs, 
about 4-6 inches in diameter at the butt end and to be used for 
posts, are loaded first to provide for as few gaps as possible on 
the bottom of the load. 
The truck bed 
is four 4x8's spaced apart 
equidistantly from each other. 
Once the first layer is on, 
logs 
of various sizes are hoisted up 
in similar fashion until the 
truck 
is 
loaded. 
This part of the day took about an hour at 
most'. 
The work was very efficient, and of course the 
logs were 
made ready to 
load on the previous workday. 
O'Connor--83 Fieldnotes 
page 3 
The next operation was cutting down trees, some 
in what was 
to become the next section of corduroy road and some a little 
farther from the road than the last cutting. 
The road runs right 
down the middle of the approximately 600 foot wide and one half 
mile long swamp. 
The North Branch runs about 30 feet to the 
south of the road. 
Cutting is done about 150 feet to 200 feet on 
either side of the road. 
The remaining footage on either side of 
the swamp has been "stolen," meaning people have come on the land 
and robbed cedar. 
There was not much cutting done today because 
the wind was blowing against the direction in which they wanted 
the trees to fall, 
into the clearing created by previous cutting. 
They were able to cut many trees 
in a horseshoe—shaped area that 
was sheltered from the wind. 
Cutting a tree takes about thirty seconds. 
Steve cuts the 
side away from the clearing deeply with his chain saw and then 
notches the other side as Cliff pushes the tree. 
Once the trees are cut Cliff and Steve trim them by cutting 
off all branches with axes. 
This may be the most time consuming 
process involved in the entire logging operation. 
Whereas many 
loggers don't take off all branches, especially at the thinner, 
top end because the lumber at that end 
is not that valuable, 
Cliff wants to use the whole log. 
He feels that, 
environmentally, any other policy 
is wasteful. 
In fact they also 
cut all 
trees other than cedar, maple and varieties of gum, 
in 
order to 
let the cedar grow back without extra competition. 
When the trees are trimmed, Steve measures them with an 
eight foot long stick, notching the log every two lengths, or 16 
feet. 
The amazing thing that is difficult to convey here 
is that 
all 
this work requires great skill 
of course, but even more 
importantly requires terrific balance. 
All work is done in a 
swamp, where even 
in the driest season (October and November), 
scrub and cedarstumps and fallen logs are everywhere, not to 
mention the water table that is twelve inches below the cut off 
stumps. 
Both Cliff and Steve out each log at the sixteen foot marks 
and drag most of them near the road where they can be picked up 
on the next workday. 
Almost lunchtime? No way 
 
Next there 
is work to be done on the road. 
Roadwork must be done on each of 
the two days per week spent in the woods in order to get the 
truck back to where the 
logs are 
in order to use the winch and 
not just sheer manpower; and to compete with the water while the 
dry season 
is here. 
First, Steve marked with cuts made with his 
chain saw the width of the road. 
Then Cliff and Steve cut all 
the stumps between those marks 
in order to 
level 
the roadbed. 
This was done by running the chainsaw horizontally along the 
desired level, the bottom of the stumps, and then slicing pieces 
perpendicular to the initial cut. 
Roots are then discarded and 
the moss and dirt is forced into the mushy, 
level floor that 
remains. 
The thinnest cedar logs, 
less than four inches at the 
O'Connor--83 Fieldnotes 
page 4 
butt, and maple and gum logs are then placed in the direction the 
road 
is going, with thinnest logs 
in the middle and wider logs on 
the outside. 
They are placed this way so the wheels of the truck 
will bear on the thickest logs. 
Although I did not see 
it today, the next step on the road 
is 
to bring a load of slabs from the mill and place them in 
between the logs to 
level that section of the road. 
Following 
this, 
logs are placed perpendicularly to the first set, with 
slabs on them. 
Finally, 
limbs that had been trimmed from the 
cedar trees are placed on the top. 
The end of the limb where it 
met the tree 
is placed toward the outer edge of the road. 
This 
limb 
is met in the center of the road by another limb set the 
opposite way: 
two 
limbs, crotch ends out toward the sides of the 
road. 
Again everything is used. 
And there you have a corduroy 
road, good for a couple of years. 
After the logs were placed in the roadbed, we stopped for 
lunch. 
Steve ate 
in about 5 minutes and was back at work 
preparing to 
load his one—ton pickup (with four wheel drive, a 
necessity on those roads leading to the swamp as well 
as the 
corduroy road, and hydraulic dumping mechanism) with maple and 
gum firewood. 
Cliff spent a few more minutes eating and talking 
with me. 
We talked about his work for the State of N.J. for 29 
years, which I'll discuss below. 
Well, 
in order to 
load the truck Cliff and I pushed logs end 
over end toward and onto the road, where Steve cut them into two 
foot lengths with a chain saw with an oval blade. 
He just 
pressed down and the blade cut the 
log parallel to his arm 
instead of perpendicular to his body. 
It appeared almost 
effortless, which of course was not so. 
It did save a lot of 
bending over, though, Steve said. 
Once the 
logs were stacked in 
the truck, we gathered tools and prepared to head to the sawmill. 
1 will be going to the sawmill soon, so I will not describe 
it 
in detail here. 
Important at this time, though, 
in following 
the 
log on 
its journey, was unloading the truck. 
Cliff backed 
the truck between two platforms. 
These were actually each made 
of three long 4x12's bolted to 
support posts of the same 
dimension. 
The former sat about 2 and one half feet above the 
ground, on the same plane as the bed of the saw that feeds the 
log 
into the blade. 
The logs were loosened from the load by a 
peavy once the metal pipes that serve as a fence on the truck 
were removed. 
There are two of those pipes on each side of the 
truck. 
The logs were rolled, usually one at a time, onto the 
platforms on either side of the truck and rolled to the end of 
either side of each platform. 
The thin logs, approximately four 
to six inches at the butt end, are separated and stacked in a 
pile designated for posts. 
And that's it. 
The logs now await 
milling into building lumber. 
The second issue I would like to open up for investigation 
O'Connor--83 Fieldnotes 
page 5 
is work. 
Cliff and Steve work hard. 
From the time we arrived 
until the time we unloaded the logs there was one fifteen minute 
break -- lunch -- from working in 
an awkward situation with 
heavy, unwieldy objects. 
Work 
is 
important to this family. 
Cliff, who 
is 63, also clears 60-100 acres of his pine land per 
year.

TXO1: 
This afternoon 1 drove up to G—S. Pemberton; 21GT to talk 
with Bill Lucas, a woodworker. 
He lives about a mile west of 
Pemberton center on Rte. 530. 
Bill 
lives with his parents; his 
father is 95 and still gets around, "putters in the garden." 
Bill 
is 55 and has been woodworking all 
his life. 
His father 
owned a sawmill and was a house carpenter as far back as Bill can 
remember. 
Bill now works that sawmill, but does not do house 
carpentry. 
He 
is a cabinet maker and millworker. 
He also 
restores an occasional piece of furniture; a chair he was working 
on was in his shop when I was there. 
One of the interesting things about Bill Lucas is that he 
does not buy the wood he uses. 
He cuts the tree, runs the 
log 
through his mill, planes the resulting boards on his 24—inch 
thickness planer, and shapes it into whatever he needs. 
He 
occasionally bought a lot with walnut, oak, and or cherry on 
it 
up to about five years ago. 
The N.J. State Forestry Service 
until a few years ago marked trees on state land that could be 
felled, and he used to buy some of those also. 
People like Cliff 
Frazee used to estimate the board footage in a log and the charge 
would be 
levied per that estimate. 
Nowadays people call Bill up 
and say they have a tree he might be interested in, and 
if 
he 
is, 
he goes to their land and cuts 
it. 
He 
loads the 
log on his 1955 
Chevy truck and brings it to the yard behind his shop. 
There it 
sits with a hundred or more other logs for a year or so. 
Bill 
paints the butts so the tree won't dry out too fast. 
A year 
after cutting, Bill 
runs the 
log through his sawmill and stacks 
the roughcut lumber in his mortise and tenon barn to dry. 
Bill has

in the last 
ars. 
He says he'd like to hunt for rubies all

O'Connor--83 Fieldnotes 
page 8 
if 
he could. 
Bill began his woodworking business in 1947. 
His first shop 
was 18x32' and 
is now used for storage. 
Attached to 
it 
is his 
current shop, about 32x50' or so. 
I've got to bring a tape 
measure next time and do a drawing of the shop buildings. 
Bill 
has every manner of tool 
in his shop. 
Most of these are power 
tools. 
Bill says there 
is no way he could charge for the time it 
would take to work with hand tools. 
From what I can tell 
he 
collects tools also. 
When he sees a radial arm saw, or a drill 
press, and the price 
is 
right, he buys 
it. 
He bought a 
duplicator recently that takes up about 8x10'. 
It 
is 
an amazing 
tool. 
It can duplicate a piece both in design and depth of cut. 
He also has a Smithville sander (made right here in Smithville, 
N.J.) 
This tool has two four—foot by one—foot in diameter drums 
placed horizontally. 
You pass the board underneath the drums and 
it sands the board as it goes through. 
The amazing thing about 
this tool 
is that it can be used like a thickness planer on 
boards that cannot be used on a thickness planer. 
This means 
that a board with grain that will splinter if pushed through a 
thickness planer can be sanded to the desired thickness. 
Bill 
has many other tools that can be shown in a drawing. 
One interesting set, though, 
is his complete sharpening shop, all 
Foley tools. 
He can sharpen anything with these tools, 
including 
carbide tooth blades, hand saw and chain saw blades; and he can 
retooth a blade. 
Most of these 10 or so tools I do not even know 
the names of yet. 
While I was there a man came by to have his 
chain saw blade sharpened. 
Bill said he does a fair amount of 
sharpening for other people, as long as they're not in a hurry 
for it. 
It seems that, judging from the interchange today, Bill 
will have your blade for you 
in a couple of hours if you do not 
express a feeling that you are 
in a hurry. 
Attached to his shop 
is the barn Bill uses to store lumber. 
This barn 
is roughly 28x60'. 
It was standing originally in 
another location. 
Bill heard 
it was going to be bulldozed 
and 
offered to take 
it. 
So he took it apart, which is what you do to 
a mortise and tenon structure, and brought it over to his yard 
during a two week period. 
For the next three years he put it 
back together, with modifications. 
First he and his brother and 
a buddy poured a cement floor. 
Then they put the walls up, but 
fourteen feet farther apart than they were 
in the past. 
He put 
on an aluminum roof with periodic corrugated fiberglass pieces to 
let the light in. 
The rafters he milled himself. 
They had to be 
made to fit the new span. 
He cut the floor boards for the second 
story 
in half and left the new fourteen feet in the middle of the 
barn as an open space, floor to ceiling. 
He and his father made 
new eight—sided pegs to fasten the tenons into the mortises. 
But 
the capper is the shock at seeing half of the entire barn filled 
with walnut boards! 
I had no idea there was that much walnut in 
this area. 
The other half of the barn 
is filled with oak --
white, red, and black -- gum, some maple, and other woods, 
like 
O'Connor--83 Fieldnotes 
page 9 
cherry. 
Bill's problem now is that he has no place to store the 
boards from the logs 
in the yard that need cutting soon. 
He only 
sells the occasional board to cabinetmakers who need something. 
I should mention here that Bill built all his shop 
buildings. 
Protecting them and his equipment is a problem. 
He 
has had 38 attempted break—ins in the last few years. 
He now has 
an alarm system, silent, hooked up to the house, and someone 
is 
there all 
the time to make sure there are no problems. 
Bill 
feels dogs are of no use because you end up having to pay for the 
hospital bills and missed work of the thief. 
Since he works 
seven days per week and often works after supper, Bill can keep 
an eye on the shop easily; and when he 
is not there his parents 
can watch and call the police 
if there is a problem. 
He has no 
insurance, other than liability, on his shop. He figures that any 
problem will belong to the thief. 
He also feels, however, that 
the problem of potential theft "kind of makes a slave out of 
yourself." 
Work again, as 
in discussions with other people, played a 
prominent role 
in our conversation. 
Both Bill and his mother 
talked about the problem with welfare, 
i.e., there are too many 
people taking money who could find work 
if they really wanted to. 
They believe there is work for anyone who has the ambition to go 
out and find some. 
Bill also talked about unions. 
He believes 
that a union, theoretically, 
is a good thing. 
The problem enters 
with some union leaders not working themselves other than 
attending a meeting now and then. 
And at those meetings they 
make decisions that cause people like a rug manufacturer Bill 
knows to fold up his business. 
How does this happen? 
Through 
the many different kinds of payments the union demands. 
It 
is 
not the money that goes to the worker that is the problem, but 
the money that goes to the upper echelon union leadership 
supporting their way of 
life as described above. 
Bill 
is concerned about environmentalists who come 
in once 
they have titles and 20,000 dollars per year jobs, and tell 
people who have lived here all 
their lives, and/or know a lot 
more about the land, what to do. 
Re trees, for example, no 
cutting of trees is foolish because trees live and then die. 
Many trees need to be cut before they die so wood can be used 
before their hearts rot. 
Bill 
is not against regulations, but 
thinks they should make sense and be made by people who 
understand the material, e.g., wood, they are dealing with. 
That's all for now. 
I will 
be going to tape record a longer 
discussion with Bill 
in early November.

TOPIC; 
Some patterns of thinking and land use that appear 
to 
intersect in the Pinelands. 
I would like to ramble for a while about some patterns of 
thought that are beginning to connect in my mind, patterns 
gleaned from talking to people like Cliff Frazee, Silas Little, 
the Carneys, and a few others, 
including other fieldworkers on 
the project. 
These observations may seem obvious to those who 
have been working full time, but I think they are worth 
discussing if only to repeat some ideas that may be significant 
in evaluating the data we are stockpiling 
First of all I notice a shift in my understanding about the 
Pinelands and the many diverse interest groups we have been 
encountering. These comments do not apply to all 
of them, but may 
be one piece of a puzzle that I now feel 
is not incomprehensible, 
though it 
is very complex and will take a long time to see 
in any 
sense of a whole. 
I think something concrete can be said about 
land use, whereas up until now I felt there were many fragments 
but no syntactical arrangement to those fragments. 
There are recurring themes that begin to 
look important to 
me. 
One of them is "work", another is a town and/or township 
awareness as 
integral to an understanding of people here, another 
is 
the connectedness of various occupations that seem different 
but are connected by seasonal occupations, 
i.e., timing that 
counts days and seasons, not hours and months. 
What I'd 
like to say, I guess, 
is that the above themes 
weave into a pattern that makes for a kind of Logic of 
Experience, one that shows how land can be used 
in a sensible, 
respectful, and regenerative way. 
Cliff Frazee was talking about 
this on the phone today when he said that you have to have 
experience working the land, be 
it as a logger, cranberry grower, 
or whatever, 
in order to see that there 
is a logic to the land 
that makes a lot of sense. 
For example, one of Cliff's ideas is 
to 
take forests that are primarily junk wood, 
like maple or gum, 
wood that does not bring a profit, and turn them into cranberry 
bogs. 
When he was a kid they used to farm cranberry bogs that 
were bought by the state. 
Now they are overgrown and used only 
as hunting preserves. 
Why? because as both Cliff and Silas 
Little noted, money for the State Fish and Game Dept. comes from 
hunting licenses and ends up 
in 
improper land use. 
The state 
also poses another problem whenever they buy land. 
They pay 
fewer taxes than a private owner, and other people in the town 
and township where that land 
is 
located must pick up the slack. 
People have town/ township consciousness not because it 
is a 
nice, peaceful, quaint thing to do. 
It 
is a matter of survival. 
This points to the possibility of the state paying more taxes and 
to using the land differently, 
in a sound ecological way. 
One 
consequence of the tax dilemma concerning state owned land was 
O'Connor--83 Fieldnotes 
page 11 
pointed out by the Carneys. 
People who can afford higher taxes 
move into town 
and bring sets of needs with them (sidewalks, 
street lights, etc.). 
People who can't afford the taxes are 
gradually forced out. 
Another piece of the town awareness theme as seen through 
the entry point of taxes concerns the power plant. 
The power 
plant, unlike the state, pays high taxes, and this appears as a 
boon to 
the people of Lacey Twp. 
But the plant contributes 
heavily to the destruction of Barnegat Bay and takes money away 
from the chief occupation of the township, clamming. 
No free 
lunches here, always compromises and risks, and negotiation 
between positive and negative outcomes of decisions. 
The fact 
of town/ township awareness remains as an organizing influence 
framing decision making in the Pinelands, though. 
People who 
work the 
land and water must take each other into consideration. 
What each decides directly affects the other. 
Many people work the land, farm trees, cranberries, blueberries, 
clams 
in 
the Pinelands. 
Work 
is constant and 
seasonal. 
It 
is as much an end as a means of survival. 
There 
is 
a genuine appreciation and bond between people and the land. 
Again the logic of experience pertains. 
Trees, says Bill Lucas, 
must be 
cut. 
They are not mere ornaments to be preserved; they 
live for a specific duration and then die. 
Their removal before 
death allows for new trees to take their place, and for the 
lumber to bring a livelihood to people who live and work with the 
life cycle of trees. 
Some trees are more useful than others and 
should be cultivated, e.g., cedar. 
Other forests can be turned 
into cranberry bogs. 
This can be done selectively. 
As trees have a life cycle, so do people, and 
it 
is a 
seasonal one. 
Many people who live 
in the Pinelands work the 
seasons. 
When Cliff Frazee was coming up he harvested 
cranberries in the fall, cut wood 
in the winter, and clammed in 
the spring and summer. 
He also hunted and trapped and fished. 
Two points — the state does not need to completely limit hunting, 
but think about it wisely (insider/ outsider problems need to be 
discussed here). 
Also 
these occupations fit together into a 
systematic logic of experience, of 
land use that makes sense. 
This area is suited to all 
of them and can accommodate all 
of 
them. 
This is obviously a pro—private ownership point of view; 
but it 
is not an anti—state and federal ownership point of view 
or anti—recreational point of view. 
These latter two views must 
be accommodated to the first, though. As the Carneys suggested, 
for example, the state could pay more taxes, could cut back on 
the amount of hunting that goes on. 
As Cliff Frazee pointed out, 
the State and Federal Government could assist tree farmers in 
prescribed burning in order to create healthy stands of pine and 
cedar. 
The state could also control biking on gravel pits and 
enforce gravel excavators to observe the laws on the books. 
But -- where does the money to do this come from, and what 
O'Connor--83 Fieldnotes 
page 12 
about the other pieces to the puzzle, for example, the people who 
are not as self—sufficient as those mentioned above -- those who 
do not own their house, or a tree farm, or a cranberry bog, but 
who may work the bog as 
laborers and then go home to their rented 
house. 
And how do these ideas get translated into legalistic 
language of preservation with built—in allowance for growth and 
change? 
So, to jump to the pieces of the puzzle of which I have been 
exploring one, that of the Land Owner/ User, there seem to be at 
least three pieces. 
That of 
1) the people who do not own land 
and who are laborers for those who do  
 
2) the Land Owner/ 
Users who see the continuity 
and Logic of Experience of their 
relationship to the land, ecologically and profitably  
 
and 
3) those people who own houses and/or land who do not use 
it to 
gain their livelihood, but as a tax shelter, or something to 
preserve but not to use.... 
These are all pieces relating to 
land appropriation and use or not. 
There are probably other 
pieces perhaps organized from a belief point of view, 
i.e., 
ethnic and/or religious groups that settle an area and have a 
different set of guiding principles. 
In other words other pieces 
to this motley may be organized differently, I do not know how 
yet. 
I do know all 
pieces must be explored, e.g., builders, 
retirement communities, architectural preservation groups, those 
who live 
in the Pinelands and commute to jobs that are not land 
related. 
One thing folklorists may have to offer in this effort at 
understanding the organization of diversity (Hymes) 
is 
the 
relationship of stasis and change --that tradition in order to 
stay alive and continue must vary and change. TX02:

FIELDNOTES 
PFP85-FMO 
June 7, 1985 
I 
went out to Emma's Market, on Route 30 (White Horse Pike), about 4 
miles 
east of the main Hammonton intersection, on Friday afternoon. 
There I 
met Ralph 
Putiri and his father, Sal (who had just gotten out of the hospital - a 
possible 
miracle, having to do with a spot on the lung, and a urinary blockage de-blocked). 
It's very different being in the Pine Barrens in the summertime. 
The mar-
ket, one of two operating between Hammonton and Egg Harbor City, is colorful -
lots of vegetables, fruits, flowers and plants for sale. 
Ralph said that when 
he was growing up there were 11 operating stands. 
We arranged to meet Tuesday, June 11th at 6:00 p.m. to go "£arm hunting" 
(Sal's term). 
Some of the farms he recommended were: 
1) 
420-22 W. Pestalozzi 
Germania 
2) 
Abrams Farm (potatoes) 
Indian Mills 
3) 
LaMonaca Farm (apples and peaches) 
Pine Road, Hammonton 
(lots of old farms on Pine Road) 
Sat around for a 
while and talked with Sal and Ralph about possible farms 
while Bonnie picked out some vegetables and plants for her garden. 
Then headed 
out to Brigantine.

We had an interesting time driving around looking at farms. 
Many on Pina 
Road, mostly peaches. 
These are all Italian farms. 
Also on Pine Road is the 
house where Ralph's grandmother grew up, one of 12, and one of his uncles' 
houses. 
It appears that almost everyone is related, or used to be, on Pine Road. 
Stopped at LaMonaca farm and Eddie (Charlie's - 77 - son) came out to meet 
us as we got out of the car. 
Looks like a great place. 
Front of main house was

When 
the new addition was put on the back, the old kitchen was'moved across the drive-
way to become a summer kitchen. 
Barn-like building behind the house was a bek-
ery, with 2 large ovens and a place where the baker lived (baked for the tavern). 
An older packing house and barn converted into new one. 
Older cold storage build-
ing, and a new one that Eddie and his father built most of. 
Transformation form 
old packing house technology to new - from baskets to bins. 
Between 77 and 100 acres of peaches, and some apples (1-5 acres). 
Used to 
have a lot more apples. 
Eddie's father's father started the business. 
Eddie and his wife, Mary -
who takes a lot of pictures (and friend Steve Zink, did Channel 12 documentray 
on Barrens) can't build a house on their 15 acres due to Pinela nds Commission 
ruling. 
She's from  G{;`'/G•'CugiiR

Old pig iron stone main house. 
Don't know what else. 
Looks 
interesting - 
will try to go out there on Saturday with Sal if he can go (6/14/85). 
Pine View Orchards - 
relatively new ownership; used to be owned by Fritate (sp?). 
Old house and barns, new cooling unit (huge). 
Looks like the biggest operation. 
May involve more than one large house. 
Will check it out with Sal hopefully. 
Rizotte and Lucca names on signs. 
Also a soil conservation sign there. 
Ralph and Sal nixed Abrams idea and a few others. 
There is one other name 
that came up after dinner that Sal Jr.i. (Ralph's twin) thought of - 
Aiello? 
Will 
check it out. Friday also. 
Stayed for dinner and saw the yard around the Putiri house 
shrubs planted (by Ralph, I 
think), and a shrine to Mary in the 
west) corner. 
The land goes over 600 feet back, in woods after 
lawn.

Notes re: 
Visit of 6/25/85 
Well, I 
had an interesting day. 
A roll of color and one of black and white 
did not advance, so I'll have to shoot them over. 
Ran into a snag on doing meas-
ured drawings. 
Eddie is concerned about privacy and what the uses of the draw-
ings will be. 
He has said more than once that he and Mary are the only farmers 
on Pine Road (or in Hammonton) who would even talk to me. 
If that is true, pri-
vacy is very important to these people. 
Does this have anything to do with their 
being Italian? 
Will callagain to try to discuss the measured drawing situation 
with the LaMonacas. 
I 
did say we could work out an arrangement where he would 
have to give permission if any drawings were used in any way. 
Also said we could 
do a sketch, and that basically we wanted to do it for historical preservational 
and cultural informational reasons. 
Called Thornton Hole -

Talked about mapping the old stage road from Glassboro to Adzyne. 
Cemetery 
Road - 
Union Road - Columbia Road (where does Fleming Road fit in?). 
Bring map 
next time I 
go. 
Talked with Mary about this, and she is sending up some brochures and copies 
of other plans done on Blue Ridge, and other Pinelands stuff. 
After we stopped taping the walking tour, which was fascinating, Eddie, Mary 
(L.) and I 
went and got some beer and drove around his part of the farm (15 acres) 
on the other side of the swamp. 
He and Mary want to build a 
house eventually 
on the other side of the swamp, diagonally across their property from the corner 
of Union and Pine. 
It-Is a beautiful spot - 
deciduous trees, with his sister 
and their family's farm in back, and the swamp and his father's farm in front. 
Sister and her husband and his 2 
brothers into tomatoes, corn, apples and peaches 
- 
ca. 500 acres. 
Could interview them too to get a fuller family and crop pic-
ture. 
After driving up and down each row of peaches and examining the trees - 
real 
interaction here - 
they're manicured in the true sense of the term. 
(Each tree 
is really like a 
hub and spoles, from an overhead view. 
Afterwards we went to 
Tuckahoe Sod Farm (300 acres), bought as the last single parcel of its size in 
southern New Jersey. 
Eddie said many times that he thought this was the most beautiful spot in 
southern NJ. 
I 
began to agree. 
Saw a lot of dives around. 
Then went down a 
sand road that was old main road in Hammonton when the old railroad was used. 
Then went into Wharton Forest and down RR tracks to White Bridge. 
A beautiful spot 
with the longest moss I've ever seen, in that beautiful iron water.

Than out to 206 and back around to Pine Road at the lake, and back to their 
house. 
That's their territory. 
Update on privacy: I 
talked with Eddie LaMonaca about measuring, and basic-
ally his question was "What do I 
get out of it?" 
If he is going to give up his 
privacy, which is precious to him, he wants to get something - 
e.g, free adver-
tising,for the farm. 
I 
told him about the cranberry book and publications of 
the Library. 
Will bring stuff down that Mary sent. 
I 
felt. relieved. 
I 
was worried about convincing him I 
was not out to rip 
him off. 
Especially after coming in on the heels of that reporter from the At-
lantic Journal (get the paper) who wanted to push her opinion about labor on the 
farm. 
Their laborers are Mexican, and are flown up here for free and given free 
room. 
They buy their own food and are paid $3.35/hour. 
Wages in Mexico, accord-
ing to LaMonaca, are 57¢/hour. 
They have had the same family working there for 
many years. 
It would be good to get some pictures of them and for Bonnie to 
talk with them. 
Eddie and Mary say they do a 
lot of singing. 
Lots of avenues for investigation: 
sisters farm (with other crops); other 
Italian farms; Pine Road farms; Pine Road as center of Hammonton; Our Lady of 
Mount Carmel; Mexican labor; swamp; peach culture; history of the farm; farm 
bordering on the Wharton State Forest; public/private zones and landscaping,-
how farmyard is kept, compared to a suburban yard (no wild here - 
all cultivat-
ed). 
Not as much contrast in Nature (wild) v. Culture (farm) on the farm, except 
for the swamp and they're proud of it. 
(Need photos of the swamp boundaries) 
OR- farm as mediator. 
But, really, yes, "really," the trees are meticulously 
manicured, and total control (chemicals and technology and gambling sense) is 
the goal. 
Gambling and farming is an interesting.notion, especially vis-a-vis Atlantic 
City proximity. 
This theme came up in conversation quite often. 
Another inter-
esting feature is "seasonal" (6 month) nature of peach farming, v. apples or 
cranberries for example. 
Six months includes fixing machinery and preparation 
and clean-up for next. year. 
And only so much building repair can be afforded 
each year. 
All repairs on machinery and other tools are done in the shop build-
ing. 
This includes vehicles, sprayers, etc. 
Also, Eddie's father has tools to 
make tools (must pursue this). 
Work is intense during the "season." 
Any num-
ber of hours per day can be spent - 
endless. 
But by October, it's over. 
Work - 
nature of work on peach farm. 
Eddie's father is up at 5:30 and work-
ing until 5:00 p.m. 
"Not enough hours in the day." 
Need some pictures of peach trees (with and without paint) and ladders, and 
open center area, etc.

Peach - 
highly artificial, in a 
sense. 
Unlike the Zimmers, the yardscape is not wild on the borders

Around the house is the collection 
(By the way, no animals. 
The Mexican laborers have two dogs 
a shop, used to house horses when they were used to pull the 
fertilizer spreaders, etc.) 
There are thresh-
of farm buildings. 
And the barn, now

Around farm buildings are dirt driveways, and then right angle of orchards (a 
few rows of tomatoes on one side). 
Buildings separate from each other, some at right angles indicating separation of

It's all very manicured. 
And, surrounding the orchard, only one border is wild, 
the swamp, which they treasure for its sanctuary - like qualities as a home for 
bass, cattails (which Mary wanted to sell at one time), and birds, e.g, doves. 
Ducks also, and migrating geese, fly into the lake and the swamp.
