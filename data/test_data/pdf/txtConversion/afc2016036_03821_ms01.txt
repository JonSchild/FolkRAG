Laura Orleans: Today is February 10 in the year 2017. This is an interview for the New Bedford 
Fishing Heritage Center funded by an Archie Green Fellowship from the Library of Congress. 
As part of this project we are interviewing shore-side workers in the New Bedford/Fairhaven 
fishing industry to record their stories, document their skills and knowledge, and better 
understand their important role in the fishing industry. The recording and transcript will become 
part of the permanent collection at the Library of Congress. I am Laura Orleans and today Fm 
speaking with Bob Mitchell at R. A. Mitchell Company in New Bedford. Correct? Yes. I don’t 
know the time but it is approximately 11:15- 
Bob Mitchell: 11:15 or so. 
LO: Bob, as I mentioned, we’ll ask you to sign something formal but just for the record do you 
give us permission to record you for this project? 
BM: Yes, Ido. 
LO: Thank you. Okay. We are recording again. 
BM: Back on the record. 
LO: Okay, though we know each other. I would ask if you could please introduce yourself 
BM: Yes, Laura. Fm Bob Mitchell, currently vice president of R.A. Mitchell Company. Also, 
Chairman Emeritus, you could say. I grew up in the business. My dad started the company in 
1954. I came on the scene in 1961, went to the engine school factory from 1961 to ’62. Spent 
approximately 18 months at the factory in the United Kingdom, England, and my dad and I ran 
the company. Well, he ran the company until 1977 when I started doing a lot more of the work 
and management. My dad passed away in 1982 and I’ve been running it since and have recently 
sold part of the company to both my daughters and they now are the President and Vice 
President of the company. Well, President and Treasurer/Clerk and it’s registered as a woman- 
owned business, so I call myself Chairman Emeritus. Fm 73 and 364 days old; 74 years old 
tomorrow. 
LO: Happy birthday. 
BM: Thank you. 
LO: Actually, for the record, what is your date and year of birth? 
BM: 2/11/43. February 11* ’43. As I say, the girls Karen and Jennifer now own the company 
and run it and do all the day-to-day stuff Fm not ready to retire yet but I’ve been thinking about 
it. Another year or so. 
LO: Let’s go back to childhood. Tell me a little bit about growing up. Where were you and what 
was the connection to the waterfront in those early childhood years? 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017

BM: Okay. My dad was in the US Navy, got out of the Navy in 1945/’46, came back to 
Fairhaven where he was brought up. We moved back here in 1947 and ’48. Charlie and I were 
born, my brother Charlie and I were born in Boston during the war and came back to Fairhaven. 
Lived in the, what is now the Mattapoisett Inn, the Kinsale Inn, or the Inn at Shipyard Park for 
approximately six or eight months while the house was being fixed up. Then moved in. Dad was, 
at that time had been fishing, was a fisherman, and decided to come home from the sea and 
worked on engines and became what’s called a shore engineer. Took care of four or five or six 
boats, most notably for Mr. Bill McLean, who was one of the forerunners of the fish and lobster 
business in particular, and worked out of the back of his car. 
[5:12] 
Then had a small building, a small shop up and we moved in 1954 to a location on Middle Street, 
104 Middle Street, which is now right where the Seaport Inn is, next to the Skipper restaurant. 
We leased that building from Leo Katz, who was the owner of the Skipper and one of the 
interesting sidelights of that building was that we’d go over and see Mr. Katz. Once in a while, 
Leo, for a lunch or whatever at the Skipper and there was one occasion there was a gentleman in 
the corner having lunch with Leo and it was Liberace. He was good friends with Leo Katz. But 
we were there in that building when I went away to school, came back, and then in 1967 my dad 
and I built a building on Main Street, 76 Main Street. We had two parcels of land, put it together, 
and built a building. Just before we actually put the first item in the building, boy this is huge, a 
huge place. We started putting inventory in from different warehouses that we had and it was 
pretty well full. But we were there for 25 years and after Dad passed away in 1982, in 1988, 
1986 rather, when we were enjoying quite a bit of business from the company in Middleborough, 
I bought this building from Kevin Degan, Degan Buick/Pontiac and we moved in here and 
toward the end of 1986. 
LO: Tell me sort of in general what does R. A. Mitchell Company do? 
BM: That can be a very good question because there are number of things that my dad started to 
do. He started working on engines and we got acquainted with a company called Lister, which is 
an English diesel engine company, that dates way back to the 1900s, late 1800s, early 1900s. 
They made one of the first air-cooled diesels. My father took that idea, that air-cooled engine and 
coupled it with a winch that would sit on deck of the boat and be able to raise and lower the fish 
baskets when they got to the dock. He also invented a brake that would go on the engine. One of 
the things that used to happen was when they were unloading the fish they would get a riding 
turn on the winch head and the basket would go up and the whole rig would come flying down, 
breaking, and people used to get hurt, but he developed this brake system on the engine so at the 
touch of the handle, the winch head would stop in less than a half a turn. With the engine running 
full at 1800 rpm it stopped it quick. That got us started with deck engines and small engines that 
would run 24 hours a day and hold together. Previous there were no small engines that could do 
that, that could sit out on deck or sit anywhere and be reliable. That engine and subsequent larger 
engines and the larger one-cylinder, two-, and three-cylinder engine were able to run 24 hours a 
day. 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017

[10:10] 
What do you use an engine on a boat for that runs 24 hours a day? Well, my dad and Mr. 
McLean developed lobster dragging where instead of lobster pots they used nets and its wasn’t 
so much an invention of dragging or an invention of an engine, it was the fact that how do you 
keep lobsters alive when you’re out at sea? You have to recirculate the seawater. You have to 
keep them in seawater. The fact that the engine would run 24 hours a day, set up the engine on 
deck and you let it run 24/7, you flood the hold so that you have water up three feet deep in the 
hold. You put the lobsters in and the lobsters would stay alive. Previously only small pumps 
could run belt-driven from the main engine and there were smaller pumps not in a volume of 
water, so there were many times that the Friars, which was the name of the boat, the Friars, could 
bring in 20 to 30 thousand pounds of lobsters. Many is the time that I was down there at my 
sophomore and junior year in high school unloading the boat with, by hand, you get in the hold 
and drain the water, get in there and put the lobsters in baskets and up they’d go. Then those 
same engines and larger engines were put up in the building and would suck the seawater from 
off the dock and run that seawater through the building into tanks that were in the building and 
back overboard. It’s less expensive to pump water with a diesel than it is with electricity. So 
those engines used to run 24 hours a day for three or four years. Yes, there was repairs and things 
that had to be done with them, and that’s how we got involved more with it. When I got into the 
business, yes, I worked as a mechanic fixing things, working installing engines, and it was very 
good, very interesting, and still is to this day. So it keeps us interested in the business because 
there’s something new all the time. 
LO: So it sounds to me, first of all, your dad was an innovator. 
BM: Yes. 
LO: And it also sounds that his early fishing experience was important to what he was able to 
provide his customers in terms of coming up with new and better ways to do things here. 
BM: Yes. In fact, I think that his mind having been at sea saw different things. For instance, the 
winch package, some of them, the Boston beam trawlers used to have an electric motor on the 
deck that would turn and run the winch heads that would just take the fish baskets out of the fish 
hold. That would save running the main engine, because they used to run the main engine, too, 
in, we’ll call it the olden days. That didn’t suit well for the engine because it’s just sitting there 
running a winch instead of the propeller. But whenever there was a problem with the rope, the 
line that was being used, if it caught up, as I said before, caught a riding turn on the winch head, 
it got to be very dangerous. 
[15:04] 
You kind of have to picture laying the line up on the winch head and then pulling on it, and when 
you pulled on it you had to put the line off to the side. When it was finished you’d uncoil it and 
the basket would come back down from the dock. Well, that line would snake out and what 
caused a problem in the ‘70s or early ‘80s that there was an accident on the boat, on a boat, 
where the line made a riding turn and it pulled a man’s leg off Well, the legal profession, and 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017

some would say ambulance chasers, et cetera, it’s a shame that the fellow lost his leg, so they 
looked for the person with the deepest pockets and they went back to the winch manufacturer 
who built the winch 30 years before. When it left the shop 30 years before, no one had ever 
touched it since from the factory but they sued the factory and got a big lawsuit, won, and it put 
the company out of business. That’s a local company here in Fairhaven, that we knew all the 
people and the owners, but it damaged their reputation and the insurance company only had so 
much money to pay, but they wanted more, so they had to go out of business. They went 
bankrupt. But we got into building engines, putting pump systems together, putting generators 
together. The old boats used to be 110 volt DC, they’d have a generator running off the main 
engine, belt-drive, and they had a separate little auxiliary unit that was mounted in the engine 
room. We used to call it a one-man band. We had an engine that would drive a long shaft and off 
of that shaft we’d run an air compressor, a water pump, and then up mounted on top would be a 
generator and off the other end of the engine there’d be a hydraulic pump and we built quite a 
number of those. Then the advent of AC electricity, which needed an engine that could run 24/7, 
and then it usually required two generators for reliability and for safety, so we would run two of 
those Lister air-cooled generator sets, 30 kilowatt and 50 kilowatt units. As the boats got bigger 
they needed more power and we would set each one of those generators up to run for three or 
four days, then they’d start the other one. Run that one till the end of the trip, they’d come back 
in. One of the things that the fishing industry has always demanded and well, I said demanded. 
The fishing industry commands service right now. In those days the boats would go out for 
seven, eight, 10 days, 12 days. They’d come in, a scallop boat would be ashore for five days and 
go back out again. Draggers were three days. The engine and components, everything needed to 
be fixed then. 
[20:09] 
You got to get it fixed. It almost didn’t matter what it cost, you just got to get there and fix it. 
Some people and I did start to say demanded instant service and we knew deep down they 
weren’t demanding it, but they needed it. So we lived up to our end of the bargain and provided 
the best parts and service for engines that we could. At the end of the day it paid off because 
some of our local competition would not put engine parts in inventory. They did have some 
mechanics, but they wouldn’t stock parts. It cost money to stock parts. Well, we had parts on the 
shelf, we had service people here ready to go, and when the customer called, we were there. We 
believe from a business perspective that’s one of the things that has allowed us to keep going and 
the competition is not here. We do have people that will want to buy another brand unit and 
that’s fine, and there are people around that will fix some of that stuff There’s room for 
everybody. 
LO: Let me stop you for a second. You just referenced the old days, that they would go out, 
they’d be, scallopers be in for five, so on and so forth. What’s the era that we’re talking about? 
BM: They went to a different quota system and different days at sea system probably around 
1995, 2000, somewhere in there. 
LO: So this didn’t have to do with the strike? 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017 
9 
BM: No. The strike was a different thing. I believe part of the strike was that with some of the 
fishing, fish stocks being reduced, hard to get, scallops in some cases not as plentiful as they are 
now, some of the boat owners wanted the boats to come in and go right back out again. Well, I 
think part of the strike was the union crew, fishermen, wanted to keep it at the five days. I 
believe that’s what part of the strike was all about. 
LO: Then I want to return a little bit to the training. You talked about some formal training at 
the Lister school in England and I’d like to hear more about what that entailed. And then. I’m 
curious about the hands-on learning; I’m guessing by the side of your dad and just by doing. Tell 
me first about the experience in England. 
BM: When I was going to high school, I had met Mr. Bud Fish, who was the president of Lister 
in the USA. 
LO: Fish as in F-I-S-H? 
BM: Yes. Bertram Fish. I will call him my mentor, second father, kind of thing. Took me under 
his wing. And while I was searching and approximately my second or third month into my senior 
year at school, he said Bob, you can make a good mechanic, a good person. Go and join your 
father. What would you think if you went to England to the factory? I said wow, gee, that would 
be good. So, he basically set up a year program. In England at the time, or in many European 
countries, they have an apprenticeship program. There’s people that study an apprentice for work 
on the floor, the factory floor, how to run a lathe and machine tools, and that’s what they’re 
going to do pretty much for the rest of their life. 
[25:26] 
Then there’s management apprentices where they have each of the students or apprentices spend 
six months in certain parts of the factory. That apprenticeship program lasts four years, four and 
a half years. The apprentice spends six months in a machine shop, six months learning how to 
make the castings, the molds. If they’re over 21, pouring the metal. And come out of the foundry 
and the different sections of the foundry making, actually making the different components for 
the engine. A full-time apprentice spends six months, machine shops various tools and making 
various components, the finished goods. Then into the assembly making different engines. They 
actually work that assembly line. They took that four-year program, reduced it to a year. Now, 
there’s no way that I learned as much in one year as others did in four, but I was able to spend 
two or three weeks in the foundry area, two or three weeks in the making the actual camshafts 
and crankshafts component pieces that they have. Then up a couple, three, four or five weeks a 
month, actually, in the assembly of different model engines. And Lister had three different 
factories in England so I spent most of my time in Dursley, England, which is just between 
Bristol and Gloucester, but they have another factory that made engines at Swindon and then the 
big engines, the Blackstone engines, were made up in Stamford, Lincolnshire, so I spent a week 
up there. But three, four, five, or six weeks in the different assembly lines of engines and then 
into yeah, you spend a week in the packing, packing and shipping department, then upstairs into 
the offices. That was one of the more interesting parts of it because they put me in the sales 
office doing quotations for some of the big engines that were going overseas, and I got to meet a 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017 
10 
lot of the senior management of Lister Company. They had well over 3,000 employees in the 
town at Dursley, where I went, and it was very, very interesting. I learned how to grind drills. 
Yes, we had Morse Twist Drill over here in New Bedford, but in those days you used to have to 
grind, hand grind drills. Well, I learned from an 80-year-old Russian guy that worked in the 
factory putting together a particular model engine. The fellow that was teaching me was a tank 
driver in World War II. 
[30:00] 
Remember, this was only 15 years after the war. And Vic, and Bob Sorby, he was a tank driver 
against the Germans. He taught me how to put engines together on the assembly line. 
LO: He probably taught you a lot of other things Tm thinking too. 
BM: Yes. And yes, I was an American and you get your share of, he’s the Ugly American. He’s 
overpaid, over-sexed, and over here, but it’s all good-natured fun, kidding. 
LO: You were what, 18? 19? 
BM: 18. Well, actually I’m going to say 19. Yes. 
LO: But considerably younger than many of the other people in that situation. 
BM: Yes. The people that were teaching me worked in the factory production lines, they were 
all over 30, 40 years old. Most had been in the war, but because that engine was used for the 
military, that factory was running 24 hours a day. Somebody had to work, put that stuff together. 
They were never bombed directly, although some bombs got jettisoned from German planes 
within a mile of the factory. The lessons I learned, very good. And I lived in what used to be the 
owner’s home, a place called the Towers, with three other students; there were four of us total in 
that management trainee kind of place. 
LO: Tell me about those lessons. Can you think of anything specific? 
BM: To this day I remember the Russian man teaching me how to sharpen a drill. It’s not 
sophisticated, but there’s a trick to it. The biggest thing, patience when you’re putting an engine 
together. You need step by step by step to do it correctly, which served me in good stead when I 
was out in the field actually doing an engine. It’s a little different. Yeah, you’re not using 
sometimes all new pieces parts. You have to clean all your parts, so it’s patience. It’s not going 
to be quick and instant. The factory can put an engine together in a total of four hours when it’s 
going down a production line, different people working on it. It’s timed out to the minutes to put 
an engine together. When you’re out in the field, you’re the only guy doing it and it takes a bit 
longer, quite a bit longer. Most of the teaching was go slow, think about it, patience, and at the 
end of the day it will come out and work. I was able to go out on what we’ll call service jobs. I 
went to North Wales and worked with a road mechanic. Went out to these different farms and 
we’d fix engines and stuff Did that for a couple of weeks. Went down to the south coast, to 
Fowey in Cornwall. That photograph that’s right there, the small one, is Fowey. That particular 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017 
11 
picture was probably taken in the 1920s, if not earlier than that, but there were some tugboats 
down there and they had to do inspections of the engines, so we’d take the side covers off the 
engines and go in and roll the engine over and check deflection readings on the crankshafts and 
those different kinds of things. It was very enlightening, very good. I think I learned a lot and it 
has served me in good stead. 
[35:36] 
LO: When you came back, it sounds like maybe there was more to learn on this end, but there 
was also perhaps a fair amount to teach from what you had learned? 
BM: Yes. 
LO: I’m assuming your father didn’t have that same experience of going to England and going 
through that year-long intensive training? 
BM: Correct. My father had picked up a lot of it from osmosis or whatever you want to call it. 
He learned from the seat of his pants. Yes, I came back with a lot of knowledge and I needed to 
be careful how I tried to impart that knowledge. I wasn’t a know-it-all and that’s part of patience 
that yes, if you know certain things you need to teach others that thing rather than dictate what 
you know. While I was not taught how to actually fix an engine, but you learn how parts are 
made, how systems work, and I want to say that the biggest thing I think I learned over there was 
how people worked. There’s many different types of people, 90 percent, 99 percent will help if 
you ask, answer any questions. They were very, very good to me and they imparted some of their 
wisdom to me as to how to deal with people, how to talk with people or how to teach. 
LO: By example mostly? 
BM: Yes. You learn over the years, not just in England, that there’s so many different people 
out there. They all have their ideas, they all have a concept of what they believe. It’s not wrong, 
it’s just different and you need to be able to rise. If you think they’re wrong, okay, but you need 
to rise above saying something that’s negative to them and try to impart your knowledge to the 
situation to allow them to either think about it. [Mimics] Oh, yeah, you know? I never thought of 
it that way. To wake them up a little bit. So it was I think good in that way, some of what I 
learned. Take drinking, for instance. I left here just a tad before my 18* birthday. Right out of 
high school, and I had never had a drink. When I went to England, drinking age was 18. The way 
that they would go out at night was to, and most of the students couldn’t afford a beer, but they 
drank strictly socially. They had one, two beers. Done. That’s it. 
[40:38] 
That taught me that drinking is a sociable thing, not drink to get drunk. So many of today’s kids 
when they go off to college or even before college, unfortunately, they go in and binge drink and 
it’s no good. By learning slow down, it’s social, talk over a drink, it’s good. As far as not 
affording, not being able to afford anything, the pay for the school was six pounds five shillings 
a week. That amounted to I think about 28 dollars. Half of that went toward room and board. So, 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017 
12 
10, 12 dollars didn’t go very far. We weren’t allowed to have an automobile, plus my mother and 
father couldn’t afford to buy one over there. Didn’t need one. Walked everywhere. Bicycled or 
whatever. We lived just up the hill from the factory so it wasn’t really a problem transportation- 
wise. But some of the guys would have a vehicle, keep it up behind the wall on the lane up top. It 
was good. Met some good people. In fact, every once in a while I think about it and would like to 
track down the three fellows that I lived with up there, but I’m still good friends with Alfie 
Pearson, who was just getting out of the four-year apprentice course. 
LO: An American as well? 
BM: Nope. He’s English. His father was the vicar of the church, of a church. Great guy. Good 
fun. And he went around, he was a salesman for Lister’s, went to travel the world. Was stationed 
or assigned to Colombia, South America, and was down there for many years. He and I stay in 
touch. He’s now in Kansas, where he was one of the major players at the Lister offices in 
Kansas. 
LO: We started to talk about R. A. Mitchell does. I think that led to having learned, but tell about 
what are all the different services that your company offers? Well, let’s say to the fishing 
industry. Let’s keep it kind of focused on that. 
BM: With the advent of bigger boats and the use of AC, I’ll call it house current generators, it 
would take two generators to run the boat. One propulsion engine would run the propeller and 
you’d have the two generators because one is a back-up all the time. So we got to build and into 
building a lot of these generator sets. 
[45:10] 
We would buy an engine from one source, buy a generator from another source, make the steel 
frame base to put it on, make the control panel to run it, set it up, test it, and off it would go. 
We’d put it in the boat. Or ship two of them down to the boatyards to install. With those engines 
having the ability to run 24 hours a day, yeah, every four years they would need work, so we 
would perform the overhauls and repairs and we would be here to do the monthly oil changes if 
that’s what the customer wanted. Or valve adjustments or fix different components that might 
break. We’ve continued to do that now. We now use a lot of the John Deere engine products and 
we’re one of the major players in the United States now for building our own generators. 
LO: For the uninitiated, what’s the role of a generator? What does it do? 
BM: Makes electricity to power the air compressors, to power the hydraulic pumps, to run the 
electronics on the boat, to provide light, to provide heat. 
LO: Pretty significant piece of equipment. 
BM: Yes. Many of the shore side, Fll use the term, folks up the hill that don’t have knowledge 
of the industry, [mimics] electricity, oh, you just plug into the wall socket. Well, you need a long 
extension cord if you’re going to go out to sea because you can’t get electricity out there without 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017

a generator, which brings to mind one of the previous Harbor Development Commission 
Directors who said, [mimics] Oh, we’re going to get electricity on the docks. We’re not going to 
need you anymore. Okay. They spent $250,000 on putting electricity on the dock, and you 
know? No one has used it. A waste of grant money, still taxpayer money, but waste of grant 
money because some of those people did not understand what it takes to run a boat. 
LO: Tell me, typically, we have lots of different-sized boats here, but on average, probably 80 to 
100 feet? 
BM: Yes. 
LO: How many engines does a boat like that have? 
BM: Most of the boats have a total of three. Most of the boats have three engines. One main 
propulsion engine and two generators. There are some boats, probably five in the whole fleet, 
that have two propulsion engines, each one smaller horsepower, but twin screw they call it, and 
two generators. 
LO: That term, twin screw, is that — 
BM: Two propellers. One particular boat, or now probably 30 of the 150 to 200 scallop boats 
that are out of New Bedford and it’s getting more and more, have another engine that just runs a 
hydraulic pump, which is used to run the winches. One of the things that happened many years 
ago and I alluded to it in another conversation was that when the winch company went out of 
business, okay, what are the boats going to use for a winch? Well, they went to hydraulics and 
instead of running a chain up from the main engine to run the winch, they put a separate engine 
to run the winch or a separate engine to run a hydraulic pump, which in turn went up to the 
hydraulic winches up on the deck. [ 
50:49] 
So, it’s not easy to say oh, yeah, all the boats have three engines. Well, some have five with a 
winch engine separate. Some have two propulsion engines. Some have three generators. They 
have two big ones, runs one at a time when they’re out at sea. When they’re at home they have a 
small one which is somewhere else in the boat so that they can close off that room, so when 
they’re working in the engine room, there’s very little noise. 
LO: Is there an average sort of cost that somebody, let’s say I’m building a new scallop vessel 
and want to completely outfit it with — 
BM: My stuff. 
LO: Your stuff 
BM: Each generator is $30,000. 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017 
14 
LO: Is that installed? 
BM: No. Nope. Each winch engine is $40,000, plus the hydraulic pieces that go on it. The main 
engine, well, we just supplied a complete set-up for a repowered scallop boat. Two generators, a 
winch engine, a main engine, and a gear box. That was just under $300,000 for ever3Thing. Eight 
hundred horsepower main engine, 5:1 reduction gear box, and two generators and the winch 
engine. We’re doing another project for the same customer in Alabama. He’s going to have the 
same set-up. That customer’s next boat is going to have two 150KW generators, big one, because 
he’s going to make a freezer boat out of it. 
LO: Is he based here or he’s based in Alabama? 
BM: No, he’s based here. Lars [last name unintelligible]. 
LO: When you do a job like that do you send a crew down South? 
BM: The shipyard installs. We can, but mostly the shipyard has the expertise to put them in and 
do the start-up and check. We test run and check every engine here before it goes and we try to 
set it up so that the shipyard basically is plug and play with panels ands controls and this. Most 
of the shipyards have the expertise to put it together. 
LO: I gather that New Bedford has become a hub for services for boats? Not just for New 
Bedford/Fairhaven. Where do your customers come from? From how far afield? 
BM: Well, in the fishing industry we’ve got from as far South as the Carolinas, North and South 
Carolina. Maine, some of the boats. One of the advantages of New Bedford is that no matter 
what you need in engines, electronics, shipyards, personnel, everything is right here. We have 
deep-water port. We have the docks, the city, and the town of Fairhaven have always been good 
in providing safe places to dock and it’s allowed boats from elsewhere to come in. You can get 
food. You can unload your catch. 
[55:15] 
Some of the other people that you’ll be interviewing, the fish houses, the [unintelligible], etc., 
have been here for years and years and years. Those of us that have been around for many years 
know that the fishing industry has supported us and has supported the livelihoods of a huge 
cross-section of the community. Ninety percent of the scallywags are gone. We’ve kind of tried 
to push and weed them out. One of the things that we like to say down here, take Gloucester for 
instance. The Italian and Portuguese fishermen and some American fishermen that fished out of 
Gloucester were old-school. They would argue about every bill that they got, because that’s the 
way it was done in the old country, [mimics] Oh, it’s too much money. I don’t want to pay. Da 
da da da da da. Unfortunately, some people accepted a lower price, but also some of the 
fishermen didn’t pay, so you can’t get anything in Gloucester anymore. There is no New Bedford 
ship supply. There is only one fuel company. There’s one mechanic that has a company that’s 
got a good reputation. All of those companies that I grew up with on the Gloucester waterfront 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017 
15 
got taken advantage of so much they went out of business and there’s nobody. You can’t get 
stuff 
LO: How is that different here? You’ve got also strong ethnic populations: Portuguese, 
Norwegian, Canadian, etcetera; Polish. 
BM: Right. The shore-side businesses here knew what the fishing industry meant and their profit 
margins were set in such a way that it made it very fair for the fishermen as well as the shore- 
side business. And it’s kind of grown that way. There’s always going to be discussions about a 
price, but the shore-side businesses push to get paid. We know the ways, no one minds if a 
fisherman’s had tough luck and he can’t pay, we understand it. If he won’t pay, we go after him. 
We try to keep those bad guys out. Once in a while one will slip through, but we try to work 
together so that we keep the bad guys out. And pretty soon they’re gone. We work together with 
the good guys. And you kind of have to know your customers. There’s been times I’ve had half a 
million dollars on the books that people owe and it’s not a 30-days. They’re not going to pay in 
30 days, 60 days, 90 days. Ninety days is cash to most fishermen. You have to provide the 
service, then they have to go out on the boat and earn the money to pay the bill. 
[1:00:02] 
If they have bad trips or bad weather or this, they get behind the eight-ball. You stay with them, 
know who the right guys are, that’s good. 
LO: It’s a unique community in that way. 
BM: Um-hm. 
LO: Pretty tightknit? 
BM: Tightknit in that we’ll try to look out for each other. There was an incident, my father told 
me about years ago. One of the major fish-boat owners was lax in paying a bill to my father. And 
another major shore-side company found out about it. It was a substantial amount of money that 
this company owed my father and the owner of the other shore-side company made a phone call. 
Said hey, before I do any work for you, you need to take care of Bob Mitchell. He’s a little guy. 
One-man show. 
LO: Your father was also Bob? 
BM: Yes. And the pressure was put on the guy to pay. And it worked. The company’s still in 
business. Does a great job, the one that was delinquent in the bill. Unfortunately, the other 
company that put the pressure is no longer in business. We try to look out for each other. 
LO: What are the characteristics that are respected on the waterfront would you say? 
BM: Trust. Say what you mean. Do it. Do it the right way. One of the stories, in fact I think I 
said it sort of as an obituary to a fellow—Myron Marder was one of the forerunners, founders of 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017 
16 
the scallop fleets. He was an accountant. He knew his money end of things. He knew who the 
best skippers were, etcetera. But when it came time to do something on the boat or he needed a 
new engine or whatever from us, he would say. Bob, come over and give me a price on the 
engine. So, okay. So, you go over there, figure it out, give him a price. I’ll just pick a number, 
$6,000. And he would go [mimics] oooh. That’s a bit more than I figured. He said, do it for 
5,700, you got a deal. Okay. You do it for 57, you give him the bill, bang, paid for it. He didn’t 
try to argue about the bill after you had quoted or after you had done the job. There were those 
who used to do that. You get to know those people. And [mimics] I want a price on this 
generator. Okay, it’s supposed to be 6,000. [mimics] 6,500. All right. So you put it in and he’d 
argue about the bill and da da da. All right I’ll give you a couple hundred dollars, $300 off 
[mimics] Nah, I want 500. All right, you got what you wanted. You started out higher. Is that 
fair? Well, if you know what he’s going to do to you, that’s what you have to do. 
LO: It’s part of that knowing the customer. 
[1:05:15] 
BM: Yes. And we have customers that will come in here and one did a year ago, [mimics loudly] 
I need a new generator for my boat. I don’t want to pay big money. Da da da da. It’s too much 
money. You damn guys charge so much money. And he’s raising hell out in the shop. Karen 
walked out. [mimics] Hey, what’s all the noise? What are you looking for? My dad quoted you a 
price. What do you want? Just a better price? And he said yes. Okay, $500 out. You can do that? 
Yes. Okay, deal. He came back in an hour with the check, paid, we had the generator here, put it 
in, done. He comes in. He’s yelling, carrying on. But to him it’s a game. He wants a good price, 
wants to know he got his little pound of flesh. You treat him fair. He treats you fair. Off we go. 
Now, there are people in this town today that won’t give him five cents credit because he may 
next year be in jail, but I trust him. He will pay. 
LO: Tell me: you just referenced Karen, your younger daughter. Tell me about their role in this 
business. How they got started and where they are today. 
BM: We had enjoyed a very good run of business from a land-based company called Reed 
Screeno. They made vibratory screens for the gravel business, gravel and sand and dirt business. 
I had employed a fellow from England who originally started out at the Lister Engine Company, 
similar apprentice school that I went to at the same Lister factory. You may have met him. 
Michael Pope. 
LO: Sure. 
BM: He had been with the Lister company, went to Canada working for a company. Fetter. 
Went to Atlanta helping to run the company down there. The two companies. Lister and Fetter, 
merged. Everything moved out to Kansas and Mike was going to be without a job. We kind of 
grew up with him in the business. From 1970 on he represented Lister and he came up to see us 
and back and forth. Anyway, hired him. Moved him up from Atlanta. Worked with him for 
citizenship. Everything good. He worked with us from about ’91, 1990/’9L The Reed company 
had closed, owed us quite a bit of money, things were getting tight, and we had to part company. 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017

Shortly after he left, it was busy. Okay? Fm trying to run the whole thing myself Our accounting 
people one day went, with my permission, went to Karen. Said [mimics] Karen, you’re doing 
this sports promoting thing up in western Mass. Would you, have you ever thought of coming to 
work for your father? And she said yeah, sounds interesting. Yeah. Why don’t we talk about it? 
So, he met her another time, got her interested, and he asked her. And if she said no to him, 
that’s fine. Leaves me out. Doesn’t put her under the gun, that she has to turn down her father, 
asking her in. So, I had to assume she knew that I knew he was talking other. But she made the 
decision on her own, came here, 17—almost 20 years now—I guess. 
[1:10:51] 
And then Jennifer had worked here as accounting. She’s been here 18 years, the middle daughter. 
Our oldest daughter. Heather, lives in Plymouth. She’s a teacher. Her husband is a computer 
guru for CVS. 
LO: How old were they when they came to work with you? Roughly? 
BM: Going to say 25. 
LO: Okay. So, not babies. 
BM: No. No, but they had been familiar with the fishing industry, familiar with the business. 
LO: How so? 
BM: I used to take them to trade shows. When they were real young, five, six, seven years old, 
the Sunday morning ritual was to put them all in the car, they’d all be dressed up in their church 
clothes, and all with a little bow glued to the head. Little pink bow. I would strap them in the car 
and I’d do a waterfront tour. New Bedford, Fairhaven, maybe go to Westport. We went down the 
Cape. I’d stop and talk to people. Fishermen and stuff And they got to know people and were 
confident in themselves so they could talk to people and they weren’t afraid to talk to different 
people. We’d go to trade shows. I’d take them to Miami. I did a couple of the fishing shows, 
either there or Seattle or Boston or whatever. The kids would be the hit of the show. Some of the 
shows, we had no customers in the show, but at three o’clock in the afternoon, Ann would come 
walking in with the three kids in tow, dressed neat, and everybody would pay attention to them, 
the kids, talk to the kids, so they got to not be bashful or shy or anything. I think at the end of the 
day that served them in good stead to not be afraid to talk to anybody. I mean, so many of 
today’s younger kids are embarrassed to talk to older people. When you’re running a business, 
you’re always onstage. You’re always selling or doing something. You can’t be shy. You’ve got 
to be outgoing and talk. So, that worked out good. 
LO: I think of the waterfront as such, it’s mostly men kind of running the show, or at least out 
front. 
BM: Yeah. 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017 
18 
LO: These are your daughters. You don’t have sons, right? 
BM: Don’t have a son. 
LO: But it sounds like it’s maybe been an asset in some ways. 
BM: Oh, of course it is. Both have taken over and able to do everything. I mean, when you’re — 
LO: And respected by the customers. 
[1:15:08] 
BM: Oh, yes. 
LO: I mean, at first they’re cute, but now they’re — 
BM: Now they’re respected. And Karen can talk kilowatts and amps and stuff When I bought 
this building, I signed to buy it in 1985.1 moved in in ’86. That mid-year, I sold my pleasure 
boat and took everybody on a trip to Europe. I knew that I was going to have to buckle down and 
work to keep the new building going and the work. The kids were, I think Heather, the oldest, 
was 12, 13. Went to England, Amsterdam, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Leningrad, Russia, back 
down, Berlin. Went over into East Germany. Through the Wall. Checkpoint Charlie and back. 
Three weeks. I left. They spent another week in Paris and around, came home. But, we’re going 
down in Germany on the train and Jennifer said to me. Dad, what’s an amp? Well, for a 10-year- 
old to ask that question, for something that you cannot see. It isn’t something that’s there. It’s an 
electrical term. Wow. How to answer that? I never thought. I just knew what it was. So, it’s a 
unit of measure of electricity and in a sense it has to do with how much power is in the system. 
That kept her happy and thinking of things. So, they’re both mechanically inclined, and both, if 
the phone rings at five o’clock and it’s somebody for parts, both of them will jump out in the 
stock room and find the part, find the book, get the right thing, find it on the shelf If necessary, 
they’ll wrap it, pack it, and take out to the UPS Store for the guy. It’s part of being an owner, that 
little extra. But they’re not afraid to do that extra. So, it’s been very, very good that way. I 
wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them. See you later. Sold. 
LO: Are there challenges to working with your family? 
BM: Once in a while. I’m lucky that they both have the love of business and want everything to 
succeed. So, their thought process is very close to mine; customer-oriented. Do the best. Do it 
honest. And go. One of the things that my father instilled in me and I’ve done the same thing, run 
the business honest. So if the Internal Revenue Service ever walks in the door, you don’t have to 
say oh, dam it. What am I going to do? Don’t worry, [mimics] Hello, there. Office is down there. 
Help yourself Well, the IRS did walk in one day a few years ago. Unannounced. Formal audit. 
She said I don’t think you’ve done anything wrong, but it’s just you got the luck of the draw, 
[mimics] Okay, no problem. There’s the office. She spent a week back and forth doing this, 
checking that. Da da da. Didn’t find anything. Everything was fine. Every bill was paid. Tax, 
state tax. Everything perfect. No problem. 
Bob Mitchell interview, Febmary 10, 2017 
19 
[1:20:44] 
Massachusetts Department of Revenue, state sales tax, came in. Did a complete audit. Nothing. 
Every penny was paid tax-wise. One of my assistant service managers at the time, said [mimics] 
Aw, naw, they missed it. They missed everything. I said what do you mean? No, everybody 
cheats. They just didn’t find it. I said, don’t say that again because I did not cheat. Oh, yeah, 
everybody cheats. I said, what did I just tell you? Don’t say that again. I. Do. Not. Cheat. I don’t 
want you to cheat anybody. I don’t cheat on the tax. I pay everything. One minute later he said, 
aw, they just didn’t find anything. I said you’re out. You’re fired. Fired him right on the spot. I 
don’t need him to think that I cheated anybody. Unfortunately, he lost his wife not too long after 
that, but I saw him a year ago now. He understands where I was coming from. But don’t want 
any problems. We had one customer come in here, wanted a small generator, paid $6,000 green 
cash for the generator, so okay, wrote the bill, $6,000. Put the money in the office, deposited it, 
fine. Six years later get a call from the Maine State Police. Did you do business with So and So, 
So and So? Yes. What did he buy from you. Well, he bought a generator. How did he pay for it? 
Well, cash. Did you deposit the money? Yes. Okay. I want your bank record showing where you 
deposited that money. Uh, okay. What did he do? Well, first send me your records then I’ll tell 
you what he did. So, back and forth. It turns out he was growing marijuana. He took the 
generator and the radiator, he put the radiator in the basement and aimed it up the chimney. Took 
the engine was outside. So the heat signature from the helicopter would show up heat coming out 
of the chimney. The electricity was going across to a barn that was very well-constructed and 
had four layers of roofing on it so that the heat didn’t come out, because he had the grow lights 
on it. So, it proved yes, yes, he paid cash. But I deposited it. If I hadn’t have deposited it? I could 
be in as much trouble not for the cash but colluding with him to smuggle and grow marijuana. 
Anyway, so that’s the — 
LO: We’ve taken quite a while here. 
BM: I don’t even know what time it is. 
LO: I don’t know what time it is, but I think we’ve been at this for almost an hour and a half I 
want to — 
BM: 12:51. 
LO: Yes. 
BM: I’m getting hungry. 
LO: We better wrap it up. [laughs] But I did want to ask is there anything really kind of burning 
that we didn’t talk about? 
BM: Well, when we say burning. I want to call it a business philosophy. 
[1:25:08] 
Bob Mitchell interview, February 10, 2017

Treat the customer right, yes. But in this business and the majority of those suppliers that are in 
town I think have the same attitude. That fisherman is risking his life to go out there, invested 
money to go catch fish. He doesn’t make a nickel if his boat is broken down. It’s one thing to sell 
a product. It’s another thing to support it. You can sell the product cheap and you don’t have 
enough money to support it, it’s only going to last so long. So, it’s going to be a balance. You 
sell it and make a profit. Sure. You take half the profit home, but the other half you put on the 
shelf in parts. We’ve got now very close a million dollars’ worth of parts on the shelf We’ve got 
engines and generators on the shelf, start. Somebody needs one, right here, ready to go. You 
need to support, you need to put some money back into the business to support what you’ve sold. 
That has always been my philosophy and my father before me. Supporting what you have sold. 
That fisherman has built up a trust in you. You can’t let him down because he doesn’t make a 
nickel if his boat is broken down. These guys are in here and they don’t yell and scream and 
carry on, but they need their product or their engine fixed now. You do what you have to do and 
you got to put the parts on the shelf It costs money to have personnel. You got to send them for 
training on engine. You got to have the computer to plug in, a new electronic engine. It’s 
support. It’s a philosophy that I think has paid off for us and some of the other shore-side 
businesses that supply stuff to the boats. New Bedford Ship Supply. The net manufacturers. The 
people that build hydraulics and this. You’ve got to support the product that you build. There are 
people will buy stuff of the internet. Some, yeah, it’s going to be a few dollars cheaper, but what 
happens when it breaks? Nobody’s around to fix it. Some people will try to buy our product or a 
competitive product off the Internet. Same exact engine that we sell. And there are places where 
you can go and buy, but when it breaks, who do they take it to? They got to come back to us with 
the tail between their legs and say, well. I have a problem like that going on right as we speak 
with a local boat. Tried to save a dollar. At the end of the day it wound up costing him $10, 
because the engine didn’t fit right and it wasn’t right for his particular application, but anyway. 
LO: I really thank you for taking so much time and sharing. 
BM: No problem. I’m glad. I don’t know whether we got everything out. Did you get your 
questions? 
LO: I did. I mean, it’s always a roundabout thing, but I think that we covered a lot of ground. 
BM: Yes. Good. 
LO: So, thank you. 
BM: I’m still upset that the Working Waterfront Festival isn’t going. 
LO: [laughs] It is. Actually, you’re about to get some information about that, but that’s not for 
the tape, [laughs] 
BM: Okay. 
LO: Shall I shut this off?
