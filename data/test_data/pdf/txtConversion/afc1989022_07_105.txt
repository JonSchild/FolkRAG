Catalog of an interview with Chinto and Rose Conrotto and their daughter, Jean 
Conrotto Burr, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Conrotto, 1690 Hecker Pass Highway, 
Gilroy, California. 
September 12, 1989. 
The interviewers are David Taylor 
and Douglas DeNatale. 
The interview was recorded on a Nagra IV-S reel-to-reel tape recorder. 
The following is tape 1 of 3 
--opening announcement 
--informants speak their names for sound check 
--birthdates; Chinto--Feb. 13, 1915; Jean--Nov. 28, 1942; Rose--Sept. 17, 
1914. 
--Rose's parents were from Northern Italy; father and mother both from same 
town--Santa Bestiano di Po (sp?) (Province of Torino); they came to the U.S. 
after they were married; her family name is Emanuel (sp?) 
--Chinto's parents were from a place about 50 miles from where Rose's parents 
came from; the name of their town is Coconato di Asti (Province of Torino) 
--reasons why Chinto's parents came to the U.S.; Chinto's father had an uncle 
who was here "in 1883 or something like that" (CC); Chinto's father was born 
in 1890; he migrated here when he was about 15;  Chinto's father wa•LAW ejmQ 
Conrot o; Anselmo's uncle was "Barbagorge" (sp?) or George as he was known 
("he was an old man at the turn of the century") 
--Anselmo came directly to Gilroy "because he had a couple of brothers here 
already." 
(CC); they were doing manual labor; "[within] ten years they had it 
all, the other guys went down and drank booze" (CC), that is they saved their 
money and bought land in the Santa Clara Valley 
--ethnicity of other people in Gilroy at the time: 
"probably Irish, English, 
Irish" (CC) 
--Anselmo had five brothers and two sisters; all but two came to America

[Chinto get up to take a 
family photo off the wall of the living room] 
--Chinto names people in the photo: 
his grandmother and grandfather, Uncle 
Pete, his father (Anselmo), Rico, Chinto, John, Natalina, Anetta. 
The photo 
is a composite of several portraits of family members that Chinto and Rose had 
made up; they gave copies to all the first cousins in the family 
--all but two of Anselmo's brothers and sisters came to America 
2-
--the first to come over was "Barbagorge" (Sp?)--George; Chinto met him in 
1923, he was an old man then 
--before Anselmo came over, his brothers Pete and Chinto came, then a sister 
came 
--at that time, Italians lived in Gilroy wherever they could find a place 
("whatever shack they could find"--CC); but Piedmontese tended to live around 
Hecker Pass (in the area where Chinto and Rose now live), and the Calabrese 
cleared land south of Gilroy and made it into good farm land ("There was no 
farming down there, just brush that's all. 
And they got in there and wiped it 
out and it became some of the best land around Gilroy"--CC) 
--Chinto was born about a mile from his present home, on Mantilli (sp?) Drive 
in Gilroy; this was land owned by Chinto's father (Anselmo) and a partner; "I 
think they had prunes and grapes, I guess."--CC. 
--Chinto has one sister. 
--within a year of Chinto's birth, the family moved to a house in town (that 
is, in Gilroy) 
--clustering of Italians from different regions of Italy; Chinto says that 
there used to be a lot of dairies in Salinas Valley in the past (100% dairies, 
Salinas Valley"), but "now you can't fine one" 
--hailstorms occurred every couple of years in the Santa Clara Valley and 
destroyed crops; Italians didn't encounter hailstorms in Italy 
--Italians also came to San Jose 
--Chinto says Italians "were very industrious--all the canneries [in Gilroy] 
belonged to them, most of them" 
--the start of wineries in the Hecker Pass area; Chinto says they date from 
"the turn of the century they were here. 
Morgan Hill Winery was in Gilroy." 
(CC) 
--early wine-making activities: 
"They used to pick the grapes and bring it 
all to a certain (R: An association?) 
association, yeah. 
And like a co-op." 
(CC) 
--names of other families that had wineries: 
Pete Scagliotti 
[sound of 
microphone being adjusted] 
v 
--the Conrotto Winery was built after the repeal of Prohibition; the date of 
construction was 1926, says Jean 
--wineries in Gilroy that are now closed: 
Giretti (sp?), cousins of the 
Conrottos; Pete Giretti is Chinto's cousin 
--other wineries: 
they are seven in "this canyon" now 
--wineries in the past: 
Marchetti, Scagliotti, Bertero (sp?), Jachino (sp?) 
3 
,
guess, in three, 
.mother." (CC) 
(pronounced: 
Guh-keen-o), and Ruffinella. 
These families had wineries in the 
Hecker Pass area. 
(Ruffinella's nickname was "Kaiser" because he looked like 
the German Kaiser.) 
--the families that ran the wineries in this area were Piedmontese 
--where the Fortino Winery is now, the Casa brothers had a winery 
--the Guglielmo Winery in Morgan Hill is also run by a Piedmontese family 
[telephone rings] 
--other Piedmontese families in the area: 
Bonfanti (who runs Nob Hill Foods, 
a grocery store chain. 
--Anselmo made wine in Cupertino, California, during Prohibition [Chinto seems 
reluctant to talk about this since it was illegal] 
--when Anselmo first came to Gilroy, "He had nothing. 
[He was] a ranch hand, 
like. 
He was sixteen years old, seventeen. 
Then when he became twenty-one he 
went to Italy to serve the army and when he was there the Turks and Italy they 
got in a beef. 
So he fought [in] that Libyan war, Tripoli War. 
He had a few 
bucks then from the United States and he became very good friend to a colonel. 
So, they were on a boat in the Mediterranean going home after the war and he 
took my dad aside and he says, 'What are you going to do when you get back to 
Italy?' 
My dad says, 'Well, 
[one word unintelligible, sounds like "sera"].' 
He says, 'you better pack your grip and get the hell out there's going to be a 
big war.' 
That's World War I. 
So, my dad got married. 
He did everything, I 
months. 
Yeah, he was on a boat coming home with my 
four 
--Anselmo leased land up in Cupertino; the Doyle Ranch; there he grew prunes 
and grapes and had two wineries; some of this information is contained in A 
History of Santa Clara County, California, with Biographical Sketches by 
Eugene T. Sawyer (1922) 
--some Italian immigrants got started by leasing land; "They didn't have no 
money to buy ranches then." 
(CC) 
--the farming scene in Gilroy when Anselmo arrives: 
"When he came to Gilroy, 
most of this was oats and wheat. 
There was a lot of cattle in those days. 
Then when the Italians come in, then they started digging holes and planting 
trees and [establishing] vineyards and all that. 
It changed the whole thing 
I about eight or ten years it was a different country." 
(CC) 
--Chinto and Rose refer to accounts of Anselmo's life in Sawyer's A History of 
Santa Clara County, California (p. 1627) and a paper about Anselmo Conrotto 
written by Jack Voice, Jr. (c. 1971) 
--Anselmo started making wine up in Cupertino; in the old days many Italians 
knew how to make wine: 
"Well, over there [in Italy] everybody makes wine, in 
those days . . . . That was their livelihood, until the storm come along." 
(CC) 
--Rose recalls visit to Italy about ten years ago; remembers hailstorm that 
destroyed crops within a few hours 
--apparently destruction of crops led Anselmo and others to emigrate; "Well, 
if he wanted to eat, he had to come here or someplace. 
A lot of them went to 
Australia, South America." (CC) 
But none of Chinto's immediate family went to 
Australia or South America. 
--early wine-making activity in the family in Gilroy: 
"Every farm had like 
winery. 
They'd make their wine and they'd take out what they needed for the 
uoI• V• 
year and they'd sell the rest. 
That's their income." 
(CC) 
e\ 
--according to Rose, Anselmo used to sell grapes to families for home wine-
making . Chinto agrees , 
saying "Yeah , 
we sold a lot of grapes . Tons and 
tons." 
(CC) 
--when Chinto was a boy, the family returned to Italy where they'd had a home 
built; but they left Italy and came to San Francisco when Anselmo had a house 
--Chinto was born in Gilroy. 
The family moved into the town of Gilroy from an 
outlying area. 
--Review of Anselmo's movements : when he came to the United States, he first 
went to Gilroy where he worked for other people; next, he returned to Italy to 
fight in the Army; [Chinto appears to be confused at this point] 
--Chinto was born outside of Gilroy, then the family moved into Gilroy, and 
then the family moved to Cupertino. 
--in 1923 Anselmo took the family to Italy; they stayed about a year. 
"He had 
intentions to stay there [but] it didn't look good." 
(CC) 
Chinto, who was 
eight at the time, remembers very little about the trip. 
He remembers going 
to school there, however. 
He stood out from other students because he wore 
long pants while they wore short pants. 
His nickname was the Italian word for 
"long pants" (sounds like: 
jaki-logo) 
--Chinto's mother went back to Italy when he did, too. 
When the decision was 
made to return to the United States, the Conrotto's departure was held up for 
6 or 7 months until permission was received for Chinto 's mother to reenter the 
country (she was not an American citizen at the time). 
--the present site of the A. Conrotto Winery on Hecker Pass Highway, is the 
winery's original site. 
Chinto says the winery was built in 1933, but Rose 
and Jean say it was built in 1926. 
--the winery was built in two stages 
--the different parts of the winery: 
fermenting room (top level), storage 
room (lower level ), the tasting room , 
and a small barn--"the junk room"--used 
for storing miscellaneous items 
--the wine-making process : "Well , 
we all made it the same, all the wineries: 
crushed the grapes, then wait until three or four days until it starts 
fermenting. 
Then you put your pumace down by hand. 
and when it ferments down 
to zero we draw it, draw it into the storage tanks . Then we leave it there 
O••ti• 
lG 
r 
for about three or four months and everything settles. 
And then we draw out 
the clean wine . . . . And when you want to have good wine you better top it. 
When the tank or the barrel, you fill it up, then you cork it . . . There's a 
lot of waste in there, it goes into the wood [of the barrel] or leakage and 
all that and it forms a pocket and the thing turns into oxygen, oxidizes . 
. [That is, the level of the wine would go down inside the barrel.] 
So what 
we used to do, had an uncle you used to come work, and every Monday he'd top 
up every tank we had." 
(CC) 
--the uncle who did this was Giachinto (sp?) or Barba Chinto (sp?) as he was 
called 
--the annual cycle of activities: 
during the middle of September grapes were 
picked [other activities not described here] 
--Jean says that she and her husband (Jim) and others will pick a small 
quantity of white grapes tomorrow morning beginning at 6 a.m.; the work will 
be completed tomorrow or the next day

IAW-DT-/020 
A continuation of the September 12, 1989, interview with Chinto and Rose 
Conrotto and Jean Conrotto Burr by David Taylor and Douglas DeNatale. 
--wild birds eat grapes in the vineyard: 
"Starlings, quail, and robins wipe 
you right out." 
(CC) 
--Chinto's property comprises two acres; the winery property is approximately 
14 acres; not all of this acreage is planted in grapes 
--the winery currently purchases grapes from other growers; these growers are 
located in the Hecker Pass area and also east of Gilroy; another wholesaler 
was Hughes (sp?) (sounds like: 
you-ess); "The Hughes used to have about 30 or 
40 vineyards. 
Now there's nothing, nothing now." 
(CC) 
--When the Conrottos owned land in Morgan Hill they owned 75 acres, with about 
50 acres planted in grapes 
--Chinto and his father built the Anselmo Conrotto Winery in Gilroy. 
"We're 
just following footsteps," says Jean, who runs the winery with her husband Jim 
Burr. 
--Chinto and his father bought grapes "for years and years" and then when they 
bought land in Morgan Hill, they planted a vineyard of their own. 
--the grape plants on Chinto's current home site were planted before he 
acquired the property; the plants are about 70 years old says Chinto; they are 
mostly zinfandel grapes 
--the Piedmontese in the Hecker Pass area grew mostly zinfandel and carignane 
grapes; they blended it together and it make "very good wine" (CC) 
--planting grape plants; it is common to graft a grape planting a couple of 
years about its planting; the shoots for the plants are obtained from 
nurseries 
--Jean explains that the plants that produced grapes she'll pick tomorrow were 
obtained from a nursery in Sacramento--from the University of California at 
Davis; it was a UC-Davis hybrid; it's a fast-growing, fast-producing grape 
called "Symphony" 
--learning about work at the winery; when Jean was young she helped with 
bottling: 
"As a child I didn't really do too much, but as I got older I 
labeled and helped. 
And it was just gallons and half-gallon form. 
And we, my 
dad would fill the bottles up, cork it and we'd cap it and put a little band 
over it and label them. 
And a few bottles were broken. 
And, oh, helped 
store, box, when my dad got the empty cases and we'd have to help store." 
--according to Chinto: 
"About 90% of my wine was delivered." 
That is, it was 
delivered to different customers, mostly restaurants. 
"I had all the 
restaurants in Salinas Valley. 
We had a good trade." 
(CC) 
Jean said, "We 
had a lot of residents, too, dad." 
--Growing up at the winery: 
"It was [a great place to grow up]. 
Well, when 
you're a child you don't realize how important all these things can be but it 
was fun. 
It was fun watching. 
I'm remembering how busy they were during the 
grape season. 
I just know I don't remember it being as early picking grapes 
[then]. 
It seems like it was later on, like in late September, October that 
we were really in the whole of the activity. 
But it seems like as the years 
go the weather changes and we're picking earlier." 
(Jean) 
--seasonality of activities at the winery: 
"I remember one year [on] 
Thanksgiving day we had a pressing. 
That's real late in the season." 
(CC) 
"And last year it was September first when we picked grapes. 
Now [that is, 
this year] it will be the thirteenth." 
(Jean) 
--growing up at the winery (Jean's recollections): 
"And they were busy, both 
my dad and my grandfather. 
And they had helpers. 
And then . . . 
as I got 
older, in high school, I worked harder because I wanted the money." 
--Rose's connection with the winery: 
"I didn't have too many responsibilities 
to the winery at all. 
Once in a great while I'd help label, but usually the 
girls would, they'd do it. 
I never did very much in the winery." 
(Rose) 
--the winery's employees did work year-round; the length of time they worked 
every year was variable since it depended on the quantity of grapes produced--
the more grapes, the longer it took to pick them 
--Today, most of the local farm workers are Hispanic. 
This was not the case 
in the past, as Chinto explains: 
"I'm going to tell you a good one. 
When we 
put this ranch here, in 1923 I guess, the prune pickers we hired were all 
Piedmontese. 
Then the war came along and everybody disappeared, [the] 
Piedmontese." 
--in the 1950s and early 1960s "Baba Chinto and Ted"--all Italians--worked at 
the winery. 
Later, Hispanics were hired as pickers. 
Chinto never hired them 
to work inside the winery. 
--Anselmo was active in the winery until he was about 81 years old; from age 
16 to age 81 says Chinto. 
(Anselmo was born in 1890.) 
--Chinto and Rose's house (where the present interview is being conducted) is 
about 30 years old; it was built in 1956 says Jean. 
Anselmo lived in the 
house next to the winery. 
--wines made and sold at the winery: 
"Red and white," says Chinto. 
"Burgundy 
and sauterne," they were called says Rose. 
These wines were blends of 
different grapes. 
The burgundy was mainly zinfandel and carignane. 
The white 
(also called chablis) was mostly French colombard. 
[telephone rings] 
--wine-making in Asti, Italy; the varieties of wine made there included 
Barbaresco, Barolo, Barbera, and Triza (sp?) 
--growing Italian grapes in Gilroy: 
Chinto grew a small amount of Barbera 
("about ten vines that's all, just played with it"--CC) 
--other work around the winery throughout the year: 
"In the spring time you'd 
plow. 
Then when the grapes, plow, then you cultivate. 
Of course you prune. 
Then . . . 
when the vine sprouts you put sulfur it, that's for the mildew 
Then if you get a cold spell you have to add sulfur to it again. 
Then we wait 
until it ripens. 
When they're the right degree of sugar [you] pick it. 
Then 
we crush it." (CC) 
In addition to work outside, "You're always doing 
something in the winery. 
You're either filtering or bottling." 
(Rose) 
"Oh, 
yeah, you're bottling, you're changing wine, all that." 
(CC) 
--the process of blending wine to get a good-tasting product: 
"Well, you 
know, I think everybody's an expert in wine. 
You put it to your mouth, you 
don't like it, you're not a wine man." (CC) 
--during the last few years of his active involvement at the winery Chinto 
"lost his nose," that is he lost his sense of taste. 
Jean has a good tasting 
ability (judgement) and so does her son Scott. 
Jean's husband Jim makes the 
decisions about blending now. 
--Changes that have been made at the winery since Jean and Jim took over six 
years ago: 
"Well, when we took over six years ago we realized that burgundy 
and sauterne wasn't the only wines out there. 
And we have so many people 
coming through that just didn't care for it." 
(Jean) 
"We had to go into 
varietals 
(CC) 
"Varietals, right. 
And they wanted varietals. 
And lots of 
people from back east like sweeter wines, so we had to go into the sweeter 
wine. 
So we have quite a few, a lot of varietals plus your fruit wines, 
dessert wines. 
It's been an education, we've been educated every day. 
There's a lot more work. 
I'm not really too much involved in the working of 
the wine-making except helping when we're in drastic need of having somebody 
pick the grapes or. 
And then a lot of times my husband has a big order then I 
will help him [with] bottling and labeling. 
But mostly he does it all 
himself. 
It is really a one man operation. 
Everything we have isn't 
modernized. 
We don't have everything on an assembly belt. 
It's one, you 
know, bottle, fill up the bottle, cork it, label it. 
And so sometimes my 
husband, myself and our son or my sister will be down and we'll, the three of 
us will work. 
People don't realize that, they think everything is, technology 
that we have today that, you know, we just press a button and everything does 
its thing. 
And it isn't so. 
So they're surprised. 
Even in the tasting room 
people are talking, they think we have a lot of machinery doing all these 
things. 
And I say, 
'No, it's us.' 
I find, I have found or noticed in the 
years that I have been working in the tasting room a lot more people are very 
knowledgeable about the wine, more than I was when I was growing up. 
Younger 
people are not drinking the white wines like they were doing a few years back. 
Red wines are very big and naturally your varietals and chardonnay seems like 
a very preferable that's still on the top list of the wines. 
And then you 
have your yuppie wine, as I call it, your white zinfandel which a lot of 
people like." (Jean) 
Selecting wines that will sell well: 
white wines always sell well and 
customers who visit the winery seem to be more interested in trying red wines 
Changing tastes for wine and liquor: 
"I find that people aren't into drinking 
as much in the tasting rooms because they're on the road. 
But I even notice 
17 
newer stainless steel tanks 
that when we go out a lot that hard liquor isn't, well beer is really popular, 
but the real hard, hard stuff you don't see too much, usually just white wines 
or red wines." 
(Jean) 
types of wines now sold 
zinfandel, Johannesburg 
zinfandel, petit sirah. 
sherry. 
They also sell 
at Conrotto Winery: 
chardonnay, symphony, white 
reisling, chablis, burgundy, carignane, cabernet, 
The sweet wines are: 
apricot, plum, cherry, cream 
wine vinegar. 
personal preferences in wine: 
"Well, I'm a red wine drinker so I like them 
all." 
(Jean) 
"I prefer a burgundy." 
(CC) 
"I like petit sirah and I like 
our cabernet, not just ours, I like others, too. 
And the burgundy, well 
because I 
was raised with it. 
A good glass of burgundy is wonderful to have 
at your dinner table. 
It's amazing because my husband doesn't drink too, too 
often, too much. 
So I think what he does in making the wine, I think he's 
been pretty good in judging what's good and what's not." 
Jean's husband (Jim Burr) learned about wine-making from Jean's father 
(Chinto) and her grandfather (Anselmo); Jim was born in Washington, D.C., and 
he was an Army brat; he was working for Standard Oil when Jean met him; after 
they were married he working for Standard Oil for about three years, then he 
finished his education at San Jose State and didn't have a job; Chinto said, 
"Well, why don't you come work for us." 
(Jean) 
transmission of wine-making knowledge in the family: 
"So he [i.e., Jim] 
really has been taught through my grandfather and my dad. 
Just like our son 
[Scott] who is now going to Fresno State and studying enology. 
Really, he's 
been, he's been raised, well he's been introduced since he was 5 years old 
when the had his great-grandfather, his grandfather, and his daddy to watch. 
So I think he will be coming home telling us we're doing everything wrong." 
(Jean) 
Jean's sister Jermaine (sp?) and husband also help out with operations at the 
winery; they live in Stockton, California; "Whenever we need, desperately need 
help we call them." 
(Jean) 
approximate annual production at the winery: 
between 10,000 and 15,000 cases 
a year, "which is really small compared to the bigger wineries, but it's fine 
for us." 
(Jean) 
scale of operations and satisfaction: 
"If you get it too big it isn't fun 
anymore." 
(Jean) 
wine-making equipment and facilities haven't changed much at the Conrotto 
Winery: 
"We have everything that my grandfather started with." 
(Jean) 
"Everything's antique." 
(CC) 
"And some of these things, we hope every time 
we press the button for it to start, we hope it works again this year. 
One 
more year." 
(Jean)

storage tanks at the winery: 
they have old oak and redwood tanks, but also 
C,
Po5s, coy, Y•4 Tr, U!c) 
AS 
C-'-Ir 
old wooden storage tanks were built right inside the winery; they have a 
capacity of 10,000 to 15,000 gallons; "They had to be built in there. 
You 
a 
can't build them outside and roll them in." 
(CC) 
The person who built the 
tanks was Chet Palmer. 
today, most wineries have stainless steel tanks; however, oak tanks are still 
obtained from abroad; wineries with stainless steel tanks put in oak chips to 
impart flavor to the wine 
marketing the wine made at Conrotto Winery: 
word-of-word is important; "When 
my dad and grandfather had it [i.e., the winery] they did have a big market. 
They had a lot of big farms and a lot of residents, but all those people 
passed away. 
So, really, we're starting, we're almost like babies all over. 
First of all, our tasting room is only six years old. 
so, we're really young 
compared to the rest of the tasting rooms up the road. 
And it is word of 
mouth and the clientele that are coming in, they're, we're starting all over, 
you know, getting new clientele. 
'Cause a lot of places have either closed or 
changed hands and what not. 
But most of it's all word-of-mouth. 
And it's 
fun, well I find, I get very excited about it. 
But when people come in and 
say, 'Oh, we found this winery. 
We've been looking for you. 
We had this wine 
years and years ago at such and such a person's house and have never.' 
And 
that makes me feel good because you know those people are going to come back 
And, well just like being in [business] for six years, we have met a lot of 
wonderful people. 
Some of them have gotten very close. 
And I remember from 
my dad and mom, always entertaining and having, through all their friends. 
Well, used to deliver to liquor stores and what not, so we, just that little 
community of people that we always had. 
So we're starting, in a sense, all 
over." 
(Jean) 
the winery does not distribute its wine outside of California; UPS won't 
deliver; also since the winery's wines do not have a lot of preservatives they 
wouldn't have a long self-life; customers from different parts of the country 
who buy wine at the winery bring it home with them of course 
relations between local wine makers: 
the is a Santa Clara Valley Vintners' 
Association; on October 14 this year the association holds a festival; seven 
wineries belong to the association (Conrotto, Tom Kruse, Fortino, Hecker Pass, 
Guglielmo, Pedrizetti, Casa de Fruita); the festival has been held for the 
past 14 years; each member of the association has a specific job in connection 
with the festival (preparing a certain food item, running the barbeque,

A continuation of the September 12, 1989, interview with Chinto and Rose 
Conrotto and Jean Conrotto Burr by David Taylor and Douglas DeNatale. 
--how local wine makers assist each other: 
"Well, if we run out of something, 
you know, we'll call one winery and say, 'Do you have corks?' or sulfur. . 
If we run out of boxes, that's the help that we have. 
Well, like tomorrow, 
Tom Kruse is going to come and help pick grapes with us." 
(Jean) 
--for tomorrow's grape picking, Jean hopes she can obtain the services of farm 
workers employed by her cousin, local farmer Mario Fiorio 
--local wineries send customers to other wineries in the area: 
"When people 
ask me 'What wineries do you [recommend]?' 
I say, 'They're all good.' 
I 
won't say, 'Well, this one or that one. "' 
(Jean) 
--in the past, there was no wine makers' association, but local wine makers 
did assist each other 
--members of the Santa Clara Valley Vintners' Assoc. must take part in the 
annual festival; other wineries would like to join the association but they 
don't have the time to participate in the festival 
--comparison of local to wineries in Napa and Sonoma Valleys: 
"Quaint," says 
Jean. 
"Well, they're way ahead of us," says Chinto. 
They're bigger, they 
have a bigger volume of production. 
Wineries in the Gilroy area are all 
small. 
Of these, the Guglielmo Winery is the largest. 
The Fortino Winery and 
the Rappazini (sp?) Winery are probably next in size. 
--the Fortino Winery (run by Ernest Fortino) has focused attention of Santa 
Clara Valley wine-making because the owner has vigorously promoted his winery. 
His publicity has attracted many tourists to the area and they have visited 
other wineries. 
--comparison between local wineries and those in Napa and elsewhere: 
"People 
that come in are tired of going to Napa, fighting the traffic, the tourists, 
and they complain because they have to pay five dollars a glass. 
Well, 
eventually we're going to have to do the same thing. 
I already charge when I 
have over ten people, if they haven't called to make arrangements. 
I charge 
three dollars a glass and then they get that glass. 
I don't do it too often . 
. . And people who have gone to Napa say, 'I didn't realize this area was so 
quiet and we don't have to be herded like cattle.' 
That's the things I 
notice. 
We're fortunate, but eventually this will be booming. 
In the next 
couple of years we're going to see a big change in this vicinity, this area 
There's a big park coming up in back . . . 
Hecker Pass Family Park . 
"Five thousand cars a day they think." 
(CC) 
--this park is being developed by Michael Bonfante of Gilroy; it will have a 
restaurant, among other things; Rose says a 100-ton oak tree will be moved at 
the park later this week; other trees have been moved to the park from 
elsewhere; a wine auction will be held at the park in October

--story about getting Anselmo's old hat brpnzeit hangs on the wall in the p'a1✓ 
Conrotto's living room)v
"i 
w
aas my, the reason we had, after my 
father-in-law passed away, and my sister-in-law says, 'You know I'd like to 
have my father's old hat.' 
Because we used to scold him every time he'd go to 
A6VrL 
town he'd have that old hat on . . . . So, we got that hat and I gave it to 
her. 
And then for our fiftieth wedding anniversary she had it bronzed and 
gave it to us. 
(Jean: 
"That was two years ago.") 
. . . It's precious to us. 
It's got holes in it." 
(Rose) 
--the meaning of having a family business: 
"Well, I think it's wonderful that 
our son-in-laws and daughters are willing to take over. 
Otherwise he [Chinto] 
was going to close it up. 
You know it's all old and nobody's going to buy an 
old winery to made a living on. 
But we passed it on to them and luckily Jim's 
willing to work at it. 
And he knows that everything is old and knows how to 
make it work." 
(Rose) 
--working together: 
"That's if we all work together. 
Oh, sometimes we lock 
horns, too, but we do all work together. 
Which is very important." 
(Jean) 
"And I think his [Chinto's] father would be very happy to know that they take, 
kept his name and kept the name of the winery." 
(Rose) 
"And both my sisters 
have helped, too. 
My older sister and her husband and then my middle sister 
who is a nun has helped in other ways. 
I think she's prayed for us a lot, 
too. 
But, you know, she gives us advice, or suggests things. 
So, we've all 
worked together. 
And we're very fortunate that we were able to do that." 
(Jean) 
"Maybe Scott [Jean's son] will carry on."
