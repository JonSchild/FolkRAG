DOWN IN THE MEADOWS, 
Sung with immense success by the DUNCAN SISTERS, at TONY 
PASTOR'S Theater, New York. 
'TwAs in the summer time, when the sun was low, 
Sinking in the west with a 
golden glow; 
Long, long ago where I 
met my Joe, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
We wandered together in the dim twilight, 
Lovingly together in the summer night; 
Nor thought we then of time's quick flight, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
CHORUS. 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow; 
Long, long ago where I 
met my Joe, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
'Twas sad when the parting time was nigh, 
When we whispered many a 
fond good-by, 
And a 
little tear trembled in a 
bright sky, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
And many a 
time we've been since then 
To meet my darling love again; 
And ne'er was I 
so happy in my life as when 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
Down in the meadows, etc,

Written and composed by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
A 
LITTLE way just out of town 
My aunty lives, you know; 
She has a 
thrifty little farm 
Where sometimes I 
do go. 
The house is large, the orchard fine, 
Where splendid fruit does grow, 
And I 
love U.. roam amongst the trees 
With my naughty Cousin Joe. 
CHORUS. 
Naughty Cousin Joe, 
Naughty Cousin Joseph! 
Oh, go way! Don't tease me so, 
You naughty Cousin Joe. 
I'll ne'er forget on one fine day, 
When I 
was all alone, 
I 
thought I'd like to climb a 
tree 
To see how it was done. 
I 
managed somehow to get up, 
But when I 
reached the bough 
The ladder slipped, and I 
was left 
In a 
pretty plight, I 
vow! 
SrokEN.— And then I 
commenced to scream for— 
[Repeat. 
Naughty Cousin Joe, etc. 
How Joe did laugh to see me then, 
And how I 
blushed, I 
know, 
For what a:fool I 
must have looked 
As Joe stood there below! 
However, he soon got me down, 
And no more I'll climb a 
tree; 
And many a 
day I'll recollect 
The kiss that Joe, 
gave me.

SOME one stole my heart away 
Riding on a 
load of hay; 
I 
looked up and he looked down, 
Hadsome, sunburnt Johnny Brown. 
" 
Have a 
lift?" he cried to me, 
While his eyes danced merrily. 
" 
Yes, I 
thank you; sir," said I, 
Nowise bashful in reply. 
CHORUS. 
Some one stole my heart away 
Riding on a 
load of hay; . 
I 
looked up and he looked down, 
Handsome, sunburnt Johnny Brown. 
Side by side we rode away, 
Sitting in the fragrant hay. 
Johnny said, " It's pleasant weather," 
Then we blushed and laughed together. 
Johnny whispered then, said he: 
" 
Will you ride again with me?" 
What I 
said I 
shall not tell, 
For Johnny liked my answer well.

JUST for a 
change I 
thought I'd go 
To the seaside out of town, 
To battle each morning in the surf 
Then wander up and down. 
While strolling there on one fine day 
• I 
met a 
charming beau; 
He asked me if I'd walk with him? 
Of course I'd not say no—for 
CHORUS. 
• It's nice! it's nice! 
Now don't you think it is so? 
It's nice! it's nice! 
Now that's what they exclaim., 
It's nice! it's nice! 
Now don't you think so' 
Everybody says so, 
And of course we say the same. 
Then arm in arm along the beach 
For hours we did roam. 
He whispered tales of love 
As we returned towards home. 
He begged to see me to my door. 
I 
answered " No, my dear, 
But to-night at seven, if you'll wait, 
rn meet you on the pier." 
It's nice, etc. 
• 
We met that night and then I 
found 
How dearly he loved me; 
And now I'm soon to be his wife, 
How happy I 
will be. 
He whispered tales of love, and said 
" 
Don't be so timid, Miss, 
And now my little darling please 
Give me one little kiss." 
SPOKEN.-01 course, as we were engaged to be married, 
I 
couldn't refuse a 
kiss; and besides— 
It's nice, etc.

United States by the Duncan Sisters,

MY 
beau took me, one day, sailing down the bay.

He called me his dear Emma. That's my -iiame. 
While standing on the pier some chaps begin to. 
stare, 
And one and all around us did exclaim: 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Emma! Whoa, Emma! 
Emma, you put me in such a 
dilemma! 
Oh, Emma! Who, Emma! 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go. 
I 
asked them . 
what they meant, when some one at us sent 
An egg, which struck my beau right in'tiie eye! 
ir 
I 
then began to scream, " Oh, Fred, what does this mean?" 
I 
asked again, and this was their reply: 
Oh, Emma! Who, Eiiima! etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease. 
We shouted out police! 
And when he came he looked at us so sly; 
He said " Don't be put out—it's only a 
saying that's got 
about," 
And then their voices seemed to rend the sky. 
SPOKEN. — You see, this is the lateit'New tork byword, 
" 
Oh, Emma!" and we didn't know that. 
So they all 
commenced together again, including the policeinan— 
Oh, Emma! Whoa, Emma! etc.

THUALEYS,FROM 1101LINGAR. 
Words and music by W. J. GROGAN. 
Originally performed by GROGAN and FARRELL. 
WE 
are two Irish emigrants 
Just frem across the sea: 
In the steamship " Adriatic," 
Of the White Star line, care we. 
At the Battery Pork we landed, 
Bag and baggage here we are— 
Dan Haley and his wife Buddeen— 
'Frbm,the town of Mullingar. 
CHORUS. • 
We're honest, though poor, 
Hard toil we'll endure; 
Be the pay e'er so little, we are 
Eager for work, and from it ne'er shirk, 
The Haleys from Mullingar. 
We were forced to leave our neat little home, 
It was po'Verty drove us away! 
They,depriVed us of our piece of land 
When the rent we could not pay! 
They took our pig and praties, 
•- 
And dui cotv sold at the fair! 
Which grieved and almost broke the hearts 
Of the Haleys from Mullingar. 
We're honest, though poor, etc. 
To seek a 
living we find it's hard 
In this free and distant land, 
Without a 
friend or relative 
To lepsta helping 
and. 
The old woman can Wash and iron in style, 
While I 
can handle a 
spade or crow-bar; 
Solfloti hear of a 
Johjiist please to inform 
The Haleys from Mullingar. 
We're honest, thoogh poor, etc. 
Written by JOHN DELFIELD and sung by Tom It!aroma.. 
I 
once did love a 
pretty girl, 
My wife in time did make her; 
She 's 
as pretty as the flowers in June, 
And a 
first-class hoop-skirt maker. 
She once did ask me for to wed, 
In words to me oppressive, 
But to get married on ten dollars a 
week, 
It's rather too expensive. 
Cnonus.—Expense, now-a-days, must be looked at, 
If you live in a 
way that's blessive, 
Lay by a 
dollar when you can, 
And do not be too expensive. 
I 
took her to parties several times, 
But soon I 
lost my courage; 
Such pleasure is all very nice, 
But the money I 
could n't flourish. 
So I 
bought her peanuts by the quart, 
Which I 
thought would be acceptive, 
For ten dollars a 
week and to parties go, 
It 's 
rather too expensive. 
Cnonus.—Expense, now-a-
days, etc. 
We are married now about one year, 
But sometimes I 
feel sorry; 
For keeping house I 
never thought 
Would cost me so much money. 
A 
flower here, a 
new hat there, 
Ribbon's, switches, rather taxive, 
Ten dollars a 
week, and dress like that, 
Is rather too expensive. 
0110RUS.—Expense, now-a-days, etc. 
IIT'S RA.TECEIt Too EXPENSIVE.—Continued.] 
The fruits of marriage now we have— 
A 
darling little daughter; 
She is well plesi.sed, but sometimes says: 
"Tom, I'll tell you what we ought to— 
A 
boy, you know, would make a 
pair, 
And would be more appreciative." 
On ten dollars a 
week I 
think one's enough, 
Two 's 
rather too expensive. 
CHORUS.—Expense, now-a-days, etc. 
DOLLARS. 
Anew and original song by Tom MAxwELL, and sung by him with 
great success. 
There 's 
a 
word, go where you may, 
You will hear it every day, 
It rules the poor man and it rules the king. 
It's the bottom of all crime, 
And will be till the end of time, 
Por a 
dollar will both joy and sorrow bring. 
When you saw the light, for your first shirt it did pay; 
For it Columbus first his flag unfurled. 
It buys the poor man bread, by which his wife and child 
are fed, 
For a 
dollar is the lever rules the world. 
It made Owen Murphy run when the people's cash he won; 
It made the triplets at-each baby show; 
Makes each father, strong and stout, to a 
hard day's work 
go out; 
A. dollar best wil_ make the mare to go. 
rDOLtARS.---Continued.] 
Now what was it that did win when litiitewaiCounted int 
Made Peter Sweeney cross the raging main ?-
What made old Beecher say, it was Only" tlie -6ther day, 
That bread and water would your life siiin? 
What makes tailors go to sea, thai when on land they '11 
have a 
spree? 
What makes a 
man go home and scold 'hi§' Wife? 
Knock down his mother-in-jaw 
When she gives him too much jaw? ) 
It's naught but dollars, you can bet your life. 
What makes girls big vesters wear— 
& 
church steeple in their hair— 
A 
bustle large enough to fill 'a 
store? 
What makes them wink their eye 
At the young men passing by? 
's naught but dollars rules this wide world o'er. 
Now what dyes a 
swell's moustache 
When he goes a 
girl to mash? 
What makes the ladies nice stripe stockings wear? 
Now what makes a 
parson pray—but don't give it away— 
But dollars, dollars, everywhere? 
What makes companies burst, sure, 
When your life you do insure? 
What makes each savings bank sky-highs 
to go ? 
A 
policeman makes a 
raid, just to stop the pooridn's trade, 
Just so that at your dollars he'll get a 
show. 
Why do all the women suppose 
Each babe has its father's nose,— 
I 
mean when your first born it comes to light? 
Why do I 
here engage singing nightly on the' itige? 
You bet it's dollars, and you'11 bet it's right. 
[DOLLA118. -- Continued.] 
As we travel through this life, which is full of care and 
strife, . 
You'll find a 
man with dollars as the sway; 
When a 
friend you chance to meet, as you 're walking 
through the street, 
What about the silver dollar? he will say. 
If it 's 
true now what we hear, to you all it must seem queer 
That the men we sent to rule us should disgrace 
Our country, proud and free, with trade dollars, don't you 
see, 
That are worth but ninety-two cents on their face. 
Now the poor man cannot choose, but the eight cents he 
must lose 
When he gets them for his pay on Saturday night. 
But some men that are in power, on the poor man trouble 
shower, 
I 
say it's caused by dollars and I 
am right. 
Written and composed by Jon/4 DELYrELD and sung with great success 
by Tom MAXWELL. 
Misfortune, that's my luck, I 
own; 
I 
scarce know what to do; 
For I 
once did love a 
charming miss, 
But to me she proved untrue. 
I 
bought her present after present, 
Her I 
dearly did adore; 
But she jilted me, and spitefully went 
With a 
chap that lived next door. 
Cnokus.—Oh, that chap that lives next door! 
Curse that chap that lives next door! 
He stole the pride of my heart 
And broke it all apart, 
Did that chap that lives next door. 
14 
[THE CHAP THAT LIVES NEXT DOOR. — Continued.] 
I've asked her once; ms, begged her twice, 
To be my 
darling wife; 
And as out we 'd 
stroll, her I 'd 
surprise 
With cream cakes and such trife. 
As yet the answer I 'ye not told 
That I 
mentioned just before; 
But I 
found out that she gave her heart and hand 
To the chap that lived next door. 
CHORUS. — Oh, that chap, etc. 
About six months ago to- night, 
Although it seems an age, 
Whilst I 
went up the stairs polite 
Her Pa stood there in a 
rage, 
And caught me by the collar THUS, 
And caned my back quite sore; 
lie mistook me for that other cuss— 
The chap that lived next door. 
Cuonus.—Oh, that chap, etc. 
They are married now, and I 
am not, 
And happy do I 
feel; 
Their happy days are all forgot, 
While mine still bloom and reel. 
He turned out to be the worst of men, 
And she lost the smile she wore, 
He in Sing- Sing five years must spend; 
Yes, the chap that lived next door. 
SPORT:N.—Yes, he turned out to be a 
first-class thief, and got Ave year.

herself without the

The Wedding of. Peter Gilmartin. 
Written and composed by W. J. GROGEN. 
A 
knight of the hod, by name Peter Gilmartin, 
Being sick, sore and tired of a 
single man's life, he 
courted. 
He proposed, she accepted, to be his lawful wife. 
Great preparation for this celebration 
Was begun and completed without much delay. 
They sent invitations to friends and relations 
Requesting their presence on their wedding-day. 
CHORUS. 
There was cow-drills and lanciers for the young turkey 
dancers 
Through the break-downs the old folks were darting; 
They tatthered the floor till their ould feet was sore, 
At the wedding of Peter Gilmartin. 
This select celebration would honor a 
nation 
For grandeur and style there was none could compete. 
In Tammamy Hall there was ne'er such a 
ball 
To equal this wedding in Mulberry street. 
Miss Theodore Lawlor gave her elegant parlors, 
Hired McGutnness, the flute, to dishearten, , 
While ould Paddy Murray had the fiddle to worry, 
At the wedding of Peter Gilmartin. 
arfORIIS.—There was cowdrills, etc. 
The supper was grand and beyond competition,. 
And served in good style by Mrs. O'Shute ; 
She was passing the oysters to ould Hughey Hardy, 
But he begged to be excused as he did n't like fruit. 
There was various liquors, both railroad and velvet, 
Which Pat Duff was kept busy carting. 
There was wine for the ladies, root-beer for the daisies, 
At the wedding of Peter Gilmartin.

McGee's. 
Written expressly for P. If. CARMODY, and sung by him with success._ 
Through respect to her boarders ould Mrs. McGee 
Suggested to have a 
grand party or spree. 
It was hailed with delight, and St. Patrick's night 
Was proposed and accepted to have the soiree. 
With arrangements perfected, the committee selected, 
Floor-manager fell to Sylvester McCann, 
And Archibald Cusick, the Mozart of Music, 
Who plays on.

CHORUS. 
There was cobblers and tailors, kalsominers and grainers, 
Mechanics and tradesmen of no mean degree; 
There was grapers and trampers and pure red-eye samplers, 
At the boarding-house party of Mrs, McGee. 
Mr. J. R. O'Grady, the artistic grainer, 
Was asked for a 
song of the rale Irish stock; 
He 'd 
in red-eye been dinging, so in humor for singing, 
Requested a 
cane, and he'd sing them the "Crock." 
You talk of canaries and birds of the prairie, 
His melodious strains they would envy the thrush. 
In antics and prantics he's quite elegantic; 
He's wasting his time with a 
paint pot and brush. 
CHORLIS.—There was cobblers, etc. 
The next to respond was a 
tall son of Erin, 
Who recited a 
poem from Boliver Flood. 
His name it is Barry,—he the pitcher does carry,-
- 
And is president, pro-tern, of the " Bursting-Up Club." 
He fought like a 
hero at the battle of "Chronic," 
And escaped all its dangers without wound or scar. / 
He's a 
sound elocutionist—brave elocutionist— 
Hanging up drinks at a 
liquor man's bar.

OH here we are a 
couple of gay colored darks, 
That are out on a 
sort of a 
spree, 
We ain't very particular about the cut of our rig, 
As you C1311 undoubtedly see. 
But we'll hoop you up a

Of the loveliest style of two mokes with cream colored 
skins, 
For two gayer darkies you never will find, 
Than Gay Tom and Jerry. the twins. 
CHORUS. 
For so happy we feel, [snap.] 
From head to heel, 
For two gayer daarkies you never will find, 
Than gay Tom and Jerry the twins. 
But now we've resolved to settle in life, 
That's if two charmers we can find, 
Two darling little wives, that will just suit our taste, 
But they must be both loving ,and kind; 
So girls open your eyes and go in for a 
chance, 
For it's talent, not beauty, that wins 
And never say no, when you're once asked. to dance, 
With Gay Torn and Jerry the twins. 
For so happy we feel, Jce.

WALKING Ott ON SUNDAY. 
Pastor's Theatre. 
Walking out on Sunda>. I 
think very nice 
What I 
would dispense with, not at any price; 
So when the weather's proper, I'm ready in a 
thrice 
To take my usual walk out on Sunday. 
A 
drive out in a " trap" now some folks seem to prize, 
But the exercise of walking I 
would much advise, 
And oh, such funny sights, and oh such horrid guys 
You meet with when you're walking out on Sunday. 
CHORUS. 
Walking out xm Sunday in the afternoon, 
Crawling out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Driving out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
It's awful jolly walking out on Sunday. 
Now there's Augustus Tompkins, a 
very heavy swell, 
He manages to live somewhere on Murray Hill, 
You'd take him for a 
banker or a 
broker down on Wall street 
When he crawls out to do his walk on Sunday, 
With his silver-headed cane, and a 
glass stuck in one eye 
He twirls his fine moustache, which suspicious looks ot dye, 
In fact you seldom see, so elegant a 
guy, 
Is Tompkins when he's crawling out on Sunday.

Oh No, I'll Never Marry! 
Sung with great success by Miss CARRIE DUNCAN, at Tony 
Pastor's Theatre. 
Oh no, I'll never marry! no man shall call me wife, 
I'd rather live in freedom, than bondage all my life 
Oh no, I'll never marry, for hearts grow cold and wear 
And friends we sometimes cherish, distant and cold appear. 
CHORUS. 
Oh no, I'll never marry! no man shall call me wife, 
I'd rather live in freedom than in bondage all my life. 
Oh no, I'll never marry 1 
I'd rather spend my life 
In loneliness and sorrow than turmoil, care and strife; 
If I 
should ever marry, ' tis true much might be gained, 
If love were only lasting, so easily obtained. 
Oh no, I'll never marry, &c. 
Oh no, I'll never marry! for love that in the spring 
And summer time is constant, in winter soon takes wing; 
'Tis better not to marry, and yet it does seem strange 
That all men should be fickle and fond of constant change. 
Oh no, I'll never marry, & c. 
Oh no, I'll never marry! although I've heard them say, 
"The love that's pure and faithful will never pass away::" 
Perhaps if one should offer, some one who's good and true, 
I 
cannot tell my answer if that some one were you. 
Oh no, I'll never marry, &c.

Twa.s in the pleasant summer time 
I 
met him all by chance, 
The robbins sang their sweetest rhyme 
And loving was their glance, 
We wandered midst the blooming flowers, 
He called me sweet and fair, 
The queen of all the sunny brows, 
The brightest rosebud there. 
SPOKEN.—Oh he was such a 
charming, such a 
delightful 
young fellow that I 
never can forget— 
CHORUS. 
When we met there by the river 
In the sunlight's merry glow, 
For my heart he won forever 
Down where the water lilies grow. 
He whispered words of fond delight, 
The birds they listened too, 
We wandered till ths stars. at night 
Shone out in sky sc. bin_ ; 
When arm in arm wc wandered on 
Way down tha le3xy lane, 
He said he' 
never roam again, 
But we soon again.

Of me cupid made quite a 
happy young bride 
By shooting his dart through, and sending my heart to 
A 
gentleman stranger, whom I 
had espied 
Reclining at leisure, enjoying his pleasure 
Beneath the light rose-bush full burdened with bloom 
So kindly he pressed me, and gently addressed me 
Remarking, look here, miss, there's plenty of room. 
CHORUS. 
Under the rose-bush, under the rose-bush, 
Picking the clover and picking the way, 
Under the rose-bush, under the rose-bush, 
He asked me to kiss him, I 
did not say nay. 
of modesty heedless, in fact it was needless, 
We sat by the side of that May-bedecked hedge, 
2 
heard his confession of love and depression, 
He asked for a 
kiss in exchange for the pledge, 
I 
never denied it, but then and there tried it, 
Beneath that bright-rose bush full burdened with bloom, 
So like the May flowers, which served as a 
bower, 
It seemed quite as sweet as the lovely perfume. 
Under the rose-bush, ttc. 
At sun's early dawning, I 
went there each morning 
To meet my romantic and strangely met swain, 
All mystery was banished, all secrecy vanished 
Dear Ned vowed he'd love me again and again. 
We do not like walking, we flinch prefer talking 
Beneath that bright rose-bush, full burdened with bloom, 
So when to the altar I 
went without falter 
I 
had my dear Nod for a 
happy bridegroom.

Since the dark river of Death we have crossed; 
Will not the unbidden tears sometimes start,

Still we number our life's Sunny noon; 
When you have laid us to rest in the tomb, 
Are we forgotten, forgotten so soon?

When the grave receives its trust— 
Earth to earth, and dust to dust— 
Are we at once from your memory torn— 
Are we forgotten so soon when we're gone?

Watched o'er your footsteps with tenderest care; 
Wept in your sorrow, rejoiced in your mirth7  
Welcome no pleasure which you did not share. 
Give us, again, our lost place in your heart; 
Keep the sweet chords of affection in tune, 
When for the realms of shadows we part; 
Are we forgotten, forgotten so soon?

When the last fond tie is broken— 
When the last farewell is spoken—

While you scatter pretty posies o'er the plain

But you bring me now sad memories 
Of a

Up in heaven, there, where all is love and bliss, 
Ah! the birds will carrol sweetly, 
But their songs I'll never hear, 
And I'll never see the flowers bloom again. 
Then the brooklet's gentle murmur—

Fell like music on my ear, 
Now I 
hear the voice of one in silent pain. 
Oh! I 
loved you, gentle Spring-time, 
I 
adored your vernal charms, 
And my heart nursed every glory in your train. 
For you brought to me an angel— 
Smiling sweetly in my arms, 
But alas! you came and took him back again.

And listen any time, 
To music soul-enchanting strain, 
What is there more divine. 
This is a 
fast and growing age, 
Our people can't wait long, 
But yet they always will find time, 
To listen to a

And when you to the opera go, 
The pretty girls to spy, 
And from behind a 
nobby fan, 
Yeti catch a 
roguish eye, 
The artists too are very fine, 
To please you they will try, 
But when you look behind the scenes, 
They're awful on the sly.

Yes, boys, this is a 
funny world, 
Some laugh while others cry, 
And though they preach and pray, my boys, 
They're awful on the sly. 
Our city belles in summer time, 
Must have the country air, 
And should you chance to Long Branch go, 
you're sure to find them there 
In gaudy silks and diamonds bright, 
Like queens they pass you by, 
If you're a 
nobby handsome boy, 
TIBey'll know you on the sly. 
You say you will not have these girls. 
But to the country go, 
And love a 
modest farmer's girl, 
Whose cheeks with blushes glow, 
And as sho hangs her bashful head 
To hide her roguish eye, 
You're oftimes sold, for you don't know, 
What she knows on the sly. 
Yes, boys, etc. 
When to the courts of justice go, 
Where Judge and jury bold, 
There sit and listen to the words, 
Which there to them are told, 
With solemn oath to justice give, 
And punish wrong they try, 
And yet for money sell themselves, 
And do it on the sly. 
Yet do not think this world all bad, 
And through life weeping go, 
But laugh with those who love to laugh, 
And thus life's beauties know, 
And if you think I 
am the one, 
Who will true fun deny, 
Why all I 
have to say to you, 
Is try me on the sly. 
Yes, boys, &c.

I 
asked if I 
might see her home, 
She blushed and then looked down; 
She whispered " Yes ;" I 
took her arm, 
And says, " Now don't say nay," 
She promised then to be my wife, 
My blue-eyed Katie Gray. 
And I

Please mam, 
wait and let us tell you, 
That our Father's drowned at sea; 
And our poor heart-broken Mother, 
has no children, mam, but we. 
Do not spurn us, do not shun us. 
We are children nothing more; 
Give us something if but pity, 
Do not turn us from your door.—Cuo.

Please mam, just one moment listen, 
You are rich, and we are poor: 
We'll go home and say to mother, 
That you turned us from your door. 
Good-by, we can starve and suffer, 
Yet will look to God and pray; 
That when you go to him begging, 
He'll not turn your soul away.—Cno. 
ANSWER. 
I 
have heard the touching story, 
That your mother's sick and poor; 
You shall have more than a 
penny, 
When you ask it at my door. 
I 
regret your mother's illness, 
Needs must send you on the street, 
Take to her this little basket, 
Filled with dainties she may eat. 
CHORUS. 
Gladly I 
will give you something, 
Coma again when you want more; 
I 
would scorn to turn the needy 
Ever empty from my door.

MURg"by TONY PASTOR. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875, by A. J. 
FISHER, in the Office of the Librarian of Cougress, at Washington. 
THE evening star is brightly shining like a 
diamond in the sky, 
Haste my love, my heart's gently, r( pining breathe thy tender 
sigh; 
Twitt'ring birds are fast asleep perched upon each verdant 
tree, 
Gentle zephyrs sighing creep o'er the deep tranquil sea. 
( 
HORITS. 
The evening star is brightly shining like a 
diamond hi the sky, 
Haste my love my heart's repining, gently breathe thy tender 
sigh. 
The tinkling bell is Feard afar, the frolicking lambs returning 
home, 
Then haste my love from your mama, for this is the hour that 
you should come, 
The dowsy bee has ceased to hum, the daisie's closed its starry 
eye, 
The sun has sunk, the night has come, and here alone for thee 
I 
cry. 
The evening star is brightly shining, etc. 
What's that lightsome foot so near me, is it the leveret bound-
ing on ? 
Will she conic to- night and cheer me? my lonely wanderer's 
song. 
Is that a 
ghost that comes to fear me? what's this sound that 
makes me start? 
It's only the wind that's whistling near me, Nall the beating 
of my heart. 
The evening star is brightly shining, etc. 
By G. L. STOUT. 
RVA sleeps Ineath the willow, our darling's at rest; 
They folded her tiny hands above her breast, 
And from her white forehead, so marble and cold, 
Then tenderly parted her ringlets of gold. 
Where lingers the shadows at close of the day, 
'Neath the sods of the valley they laid her away. 
Eva, dear Eva, our treasure, our love, 
Singing hosannah with angels above. 
CHORUS. 
Under the violets forever she sleeps, 
Where the pale moon and stars nightly over her weep. 
Eva, dear Eva, our treasure, our love, 
Singing hosannah with angels above. 
We bow to thy mercy, thou giver of all, 
Who tenderly watches the small sparrows fall. 
But 'tis hard that the angel thou give us in trust, 
In our warm love should wither and crumble to dust. 
But in infinite mercy you gave us to see 
How pure and unspotless an angel could be. 
Eva, dear Eva, our treasure, our love, 
Singing hosannah with angels above. 
Eva, dear Eva, etc.

FALSE REARTED. 
Sung by Bomar; HOWARD, in his original character of 
Morgan Price," in his thrilling Drama entitled 
" 
THE STUBBORN JUROR." 
Oh! would that we had never met, 
Oh! would that we had never loved! 
Then I 
had never known regret, 
Nor she unfaithful proved. 
But new 'tis past, and ne'er again 
Shall love enthral me with its chain; 
'Tis past, and I 
have loved in vain; 
False hearted one, farewell! 
So false, and yet so fair to see, 
Her dream-like beauty haunts me yet 
And tho' she now be dead to me, 
I 
cannot all forget. 
But now ' tis past, and ne'er again 
Shall love enthral me with its chain 
'Tis past, and I 
have loved in vain; 
False hearted one farewell!

THE GIRL WITH THE LATEST STYLE. 
AM 
anng by MISS Kirrr BROOKE, of TONY PASTOR'S Orem Troupe. 
I'M a 
damsel you'll please understand, 
Who likes to keep pace with the fashion, 
Tho' I 
don't quite go in for the grand, 
I 
confess that for dress I've a 
passion. 
I 
flatter myself I 
am able, 
To show it off too all the while, 
I 
get all the modes by the cable, 
So what do you think of my style. 
CHORUS. 
I'm the girl with the latest style, 
The girl with the latest style, 
In the street or the park observers remark, 
The girl with the latest style. 
I've a 
rare swarm of base imitators, 
Who try all my fancies to foil, 
You must know now that I 
was the first, 
To introduce this kind of style, 
I 
saw it while walking the beach, sirs, 
At Long Branch where the girls flirt and stalk, 
So I 
thought a 
good lesson I'd teach them, 
The way to get up a 
new style. 
I'm the girl, &c. 
Bright fashions, green some say I 
look, 
Others think me a 
regular grey, 
A 
regular woman's rights girl one said I 
was, 
Which of course a 
girl's feelings annoy. 
Now I'm neither the one or the other, 
I'm a 
native of Jersey, don't smile, 
But it gives you a 
nobby appearance, 
When dressed in the latest style. 
I'm the girl, &C. 
It has such an effect upon the men, sirs, 
At me how the fellows do stare, 
They imitate me all thay can, sirs, 
As some new kind of style I 
do wear, 
I've been asked to be wed by a 
charmer, 
I'm afraid that he must wait awhile, 
For to lead all the fashions I'd rather, 
And dress in the best swellish style. 
PIA the girl, U.

FLIRTING IN THE LANES

at the National Comique, Cincinnati, O., 
HE. 
WHILE walking down the lane just now, 
With pleasure and surprise, 
I 
saw a 
pretty brunette face, 
She had such lovely eyes, 
She smiled, I 
winked, she kissed her hand, 
I 
beckoned her this way, 
I'll stop and wait a 
little while, 
To hear what she will say.. 
CHORUS. 
I 
hope this young girl's not afraid, 
To come and meet me here, 
My heart's all in a 
flutter now, 
To see this brunette dear. 
SHE. 
I 
wonder where that young man's gone, 
That passed my house just now, 
I 
know his face but not his name, 
His style is grand I 
vow. 
He winked at me so slyly then, 
I 
kissed my hand that way. 
I'll stop and wait a 
little while, 
And see him come this way. 
CHORUS. 
I 
hope that young man's coming back, 
To show his style and grace, 
My hearts all in a 
flutter now, 
To see his handsome face. 
HE. 
Please pardon my intrusion, Miss, 
SHE. 
Ah, its nothing more than fair, 
Your right is in flirtation, 
My name is Kitty Claire.

One kiss I'll have and then we'll go,

Heartless, Faithless Benjamin. 
Written by 0. L. STorrE, and sung by Miss .TENszE IliumKs. 
I'M all the way from Jersey State, 
A 
simple girl I 
am you see, 
And my sad story I'll relate, 
If you will only list to me: 
'Tis about a 
2alse and fickle man, 
Whose name I'll tell was Benjamin, 
But I 
called him now and then, 
Fickle-hearted, faithless Ben. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! fickle-hearted Benjamin, 
Oh ! faithless, heartless, truthless Ben, 
I 
had been happy with my friend, 
If I 
ne'er had met you, faithless Ben. 
He used to work in daddy's field, 
A mowing of the new- cut hay, 
And at nightfall we would meet, 
When dad and main had gone away. 
There in the clover on his knees, 
He vowed his heart was mine, and when 
His father's ships came o'er the seas, 
he'd take and make inc Mrs. Ben. 
Oh! fickle-hearted Benjamin, &c. 
But his vows to me were all a 
lie, 
his father had no ships at sea, 
And now I'm only left to sigh, 
For he has robbed both dad and me— 
Dad of his watch, me of my heart, 
And if I 
only meet him there, 
You see how I'll meak him smart, 
That cruel- hearted, faithless Ben. 
I'M WAITING FOR THEE. 
Written and Composed by BARRY' CARTER for J. FIELDING 
THE bright stars are beaming above in the skies, 
With soft golden light, like your own pretty eyes, 
As lonely I'm waiting, down, here, by the sea 
Where the wild waves are singing ; I'm waiting for thee. 
Come, Nora! ' 
CHORUS, 
Nora.—Oh, Barney! 
Barney.—Sweet Nora, mavourneen! I'm waiting for thee, 
Come, Nora! 
Nora.—Oh, '
Barney! 
Mavourneen ! ma,vourneen! I'm waiting for thee! 
Down yonder green lane, where the sweet roses twine, 
The Father is waiting, our true hearts to join, 
One bright ray of sunshine thy future shall be, 
My own blue-eyed darling, aeushla, machree ! 
Come, Nora! 
Oh, Barney ! 
Afar o'er the waves, down yon bright little bay, 
'Fhe bonnie barque's awaiting to bear us away, 
To fair, free Columbia, God's land of the free ! 
Then, come to me, Nora, acushla, machree ! 
Come, Nora 
Oh, Barney! & c.

Prince St., N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
have a 
darling whom I 
adore, 
When he is near I 
am sighing no more: 
Lone are the hours when we are apart, 
Fondly his image now dwells in my heart. 
Sweet hours of gladness we pass side by side, 
Waiting the day when I'll be his bride; 
Dearly he loves me, but never in vain, 
Soon he is coming to kiss me again. 
CHORUS. 
Kiss rue again and say that you love me, 
Ever my darling remain; 
Kiss me again, and if I 
complain, 
Say that you love me and kiss me again. 
Sweet is the kiss that lovers can share, 
How it will cheer you and banish all care ; 
Never refuse one, never be shy, 
Don't be too bashful and scream out " Oh, my!" 
Kisses are plenty and kisses are sweet, 
When you take one the dose you'll repeat; 
If with your lov'd one you'd always remain, 
Come to his side and say, " kiss me again !" 
Kiss me again, etc. 
My wife and I

In a 
neat little cot we call our own ; 
She loves gin and I

I

Ha, ha, ha ! 
If I'd a 
cow which gave such milk, 
I'd clothe her in the finest silk ; 
I'd feed her on the sweetest hay, 
And I'd milk her forty times a 
day. 
Ha, ha, ha ! &C. 
The rose is red, my nose is too, 
The violet's blue, and so are you ; 
And yet I 
guess before I 
stop, 
I'd better take another drop.

THERE is not a

My Charley is a 
Sailor bold, 
A

He is a

That banner that we all do love, 
Which does defend the right. 
C HORUS. 
When the cry of battle's heard—he flies quick at the word,

He's always first in fight, beneath our banner bright,

'Twos on a

lie stood upon his vessel's deck, 
As she sailed down the bay; 
lie gave me one sweet parting smile,

"

That has our flag defied! "

He'll fight the battle well; 
As Farragut, and Lawrence did, 
And history will tell. 
When the cry, 
I

He well defends our land; 
But better still I 
love to praifie, 
Our nation's sailor band !

In joyful glee we'll meet;

long to clasp my Charley's hand, 
Safe from the Key West Fleet.

DON'T BOTHER ME, CHARLIE. 
As Sung by THE Bit/Lacms. 
Oh! dear, what a 
plague and a 
bother 
Now all you men are to be sure; 
I'ts really too bad, ' pon my honor, 
In fact, I may say quite a 
bore; 
There's Charlie does nothing but worry me 
All about naming the day; 
But, I 
tell him that I'm in no hurry, 
And often he makes me say— 
CHORUS. 
" 
Don't bother me, Charlie, 
Don't you be such a 
tease! 
It's no use, Charlie, 
I shall marry whenever I 
please 
You men you are all such deceivers, 
We find you out more ev'ry day; 
And we girls are such silly believers 
In ev'rything you choose tp say; 
Such sweet, pretty, soft little speeches— 
Such devotion, ah! never was seen; 
Only sometimes experience teaches, 
That you've said rather more than you mean! 
"Don't bother," &c. 
You all say that as soon as you're married, 
You'll settle down quiet in life ; 
And never away you'll be carried, 
From your dear little, good little wife ; 
But, oh! I've known one or two cases, 
Where the dear loving husband will roam! 
And you'll see him in all sorts of places, 
liut seldom you'll see him at home ! 
" 
Don't bother," &c. 
Charlie says he will do something shocking—, 
For a 
soldier, or sailor he'll go ; 
Or hang himself up with his stocking ! 
I 
hope he don't mean it, you know. 
Of course, I 
should not like to lose him, 
For I 
do think thnt Charlie is true; 
And, perhaps, it's not right to abuse him— 
I 
don't think it is, now,—do you ?

'1rbe Little Flirt.—Contains the Secrets of HandkerchleG 
Glove, and Parasol Flirtations ; the correct interpretation of all Signaisk 
imparior to the deaf and dumb alphabet, as the notice of bystanders 
is not attracted; the most delicate hints can be given without danger a 
misunderstanding—also, the Floral language of Love. The whole form-
ing a 
rare amusement for young ladies and gentlemen. Read what two 
leading New York papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Mail writer 
"A. Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fiestas's, 98 Nati-
eau street called the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommen4 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
oncourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
sphere to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the lure 
oorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
Tile N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We ha-,o 
lately seen 
nest little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing 'civenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. 
J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the mochas operandi of flirting, and of the moaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recont-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

11apoleon's Oraculum.— A 
Verbatim Copy of the Lon-

perfect fac simile of the one used by NAPOLEON, and consulted 
by him on every important occasion. Happy had it been for him had he 
abided by, or been ruled by the answers of this Oracle. No further lib-
erties have been taken in ihe translation, than merely to adapt it to the 
usages of this country. 
The questions being more numerous, and the 
the answers more diversified than any edition ever before published in 
the United States, renders it much more valuable and interesting than 
any mutilated copy can possibly be. 
And in this enlarged state it is 
adapted to all conditions of life ; and persons of both sexes, whatever 
their situation or capacity, may with confidence refer to its pages to 
derive information, and for the purpose of regulating their future con- , 
duct, according to its Oracular Counsels

published it for years, and the demand is eontinually increasing.

Sad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
Jour rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an. 
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing.

are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of' Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-oommittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are ispent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of quastions and answers, will cover every 
„ 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
a) adopted by the parties to the game as their own. unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
