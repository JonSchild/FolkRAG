Winter Quarter 1985 
Th 1:30-3:20 
(3 Credits) 
Although the class will reset for lecture discussion and denvnstration once ;ieekly, 
the heart of the activity will be individual work or the practical skills of 
observation and interview. 
All members of the seminar will engage in a 
series 
of practical exercises, to gain soave experience of ii-ethods of note taking, and 
use of such equipment as cameras, tape recorders. compass and maps . We will 
make diagrams and raps, keep a 
journal and so forth.

17 October 1983 
Mary Hufford, Director 
Pinelands Folklife Project,

The Library of Congress 
Dear Mary, 
Here is my summary of field work in New Jersey, October 7-11, with 
recommendations and invoice requesting the first installment ($600) of my 
consulting fee. 
Highlights of my October trip were as follows: 
1) I interviewed Leo and Hazel Landy (with Elaine Thatcher)on 
"weed" gathering for the florist trade, the Landy's occupation. 
We observed 
the curing process used to open pine cones and to dry cattails and other 
decorative plants; we collected a complete set of specimens labeled with 
the Landy's preferred names (EH1008 and ET's ALOG). 
2) I interviewed William Wasiowich--aka "Bill," Fred Brown's 
understudy in McPhee's Pine Barrens --twice (with Joe Czernicki). 
On the 
first visit he showed us around his yard and described what was involved in 
"pulling moss," i.e., harvesting sphagnum moss for sale to local florist 
supply dealers. 
On the second visit he took us to the East Plains where 
he demonstrated pine cone gathering and to a cedar bog where he collects 
sphagnum moss. 
He identified plants encountered and demonstrated harvesting 
tools and techniques. 
Bill provided interesting insight into the "strategy" 
he employs in his harvesting activities (EH1009, 1011, the latter transcribed 
by C. Cartwright from my tape). 
3) I interviewed Tom and Muriel Brown of Millville/Cumberland (w/J. Czernicki): 
Tom is a lifelong trapper of muskrat, fox, and raccoon and a leader in 
local trapping circles. 
He and Muriel were gracious and loquacious hosts--
providing four hours of taped commentary. 
He described the trapping business 
in great detail and showed us his workshops and trapper museum (ALOG-EH1010, 
to be transcribed by staff). 
4) I surveyed major Pinelands habitat types to gain a sense of 
their botanical structure, including upland pine-oak forests, white cedar 
bogs, dwarf pine plains, riparian woodland, salt marsh, and the margins of 
agricultural fields. 
5) I initiated an informal plant collection (70+ species) in order to 
familiarize myself with the local flora. 
I was able to locate and identify 
specimens of all local tree species, 500 of so of local shrub species, and 
perhaps 10% of local herbaceous plants using Ferren, Braxton, and Hand's 
"Common Vascular Plants of the Pine Barrens." 
I took photographs of many 
species for use in later interpretive projects. 
6) I learned record keeping techniques and procedures, including use 
of the KayPro computers and tape recording equipment. 
During my December visit I hope to visit the Landy's, Brown's, and 
Wasiowich again; all invited me to return. 
As it will be winter I will use 
the time to elicit as complete an inventory of plant and animal names (with 
associated lore & use) known to each of these consultants, as each represents 
a different economic perspective. 
I also hope to go with Tom Brown trapping 
and with the others on plant collection expeditions. 
I also intend to contact 
Miss Lois Morris of Whiting (relative of a friend) who is an avid birder who 
has been active in Pinelands issues. 
I will explore with her the "birders" 
(2) 
perception of the region's value as an educational and recreational resource. 
As per our telephone conversation of 13 October, I believe we should 
give high priority to establishing a special ethnobotanical collection at a 
local herbarium, e.g., at Rutgers. 
I believe such a herbarium would be 
willing to dirate and house specimens as part of their collections and to 
loan plant presses and provide instructions in their use, if our fieldworkers 
would provide carefully prepared specimens with adequate data. 
Plant 
collecting could then become a normal adjunct of each field worker's 
activities. 
We should also set up an ethnobiological data retrieval system, 
either by marking relevant entries for ready recovery and/or by establishing 
a special computer file, e.g., "PLOG," for plants, where plant specimen data 
and ethnobotanical data could be summarized and cross-indexed to other data 
files. 
I have sent some notes on this to C. Cartwright and have discussed 
such a plan with S. Samuelson. 
If these things are done, I believe it would 
be possible to write a "Pinelands Ethnobiology" book for a general audience. 
Such a book would ably serve the interpretive goals of this project, but 
may require (probably will require) additional time in the field. 
I believe 
such a volume would be very popular and heighten the appreciation of visitors 
to the Pinelands Reserve both for the natural environment and for the local 
residents and their ways of life. 
Specifically, I would hope to be involved 
throughout in the production of such a book. 
Also, I would hope that members 
of the research team particular interested in such a project could be encouraged 
to pursue ethnobiological/cultural ecological issues, time permitting. 
I hope this report is what you had in mind. 
If not, let me know. 
Sincerely yours, 
Eugene Hu/nn, Professor 
Department of Anthropology

It's been a pleasure working with you'all.

Pinelands Folklife Project 
Midterm report 
Eugene Hunn--ethnobiological consultant 
My role in this project lacked the intense full-time (or even part time) 
engagement the other field workers shared. 
So far I 
have spent about 8 days 
(of 30 contracted for) in New Jersey and have interviewed or visited eight 
"informants," none so far in sufficient depth to achieve "epiphany." 
I suspect 
the fragmented nature of my visits to the area may make such a personal break-
through unlikely. 
Thus my role may be more effectively that of searching for 
synthesizing themes in the work of others and gap-filling. 
In reading the logs 
of other field workers (I've 
one through Jens' and a very few others so far) 
I realize how much of ethnobiddological relevance has already been assembled 
without necessarily intending to contribute to an "ethnobiologyical" analysis. 
I 
hope to avoid going over ground already familiar to my colleagues in my own 
field work. 
Yet there are gaps I 
believe need filling in. 
One aspect of the Pinelands 
phenomenon that we need to understand more fully is the role of the "environ-
mentalist." 
We have already adopted a defensive stance against "them," on the 
assumption that the Elizabeth Woodfords wish to impose a pristine wilderness 
upon our pinelands natives. 
Do we really know what Mrs. Woodford's point of 
view is? 
Do we know what the Pinelands means to her and to others of like 
persuasion? 
Do we appreciate the diversity of perspectives, experiences, and 
goals within that "environmentalist" camp? 
I interviewed not only Mrs. 
Woodford--and found her to have a sensitive appreciation not only for pinelands 
plants and animals but also for pinelands people--but also a Jim Stasz, a young 
biologist I 
met on the Pinelands Christmas Bird Count--a ritual celebration 
on a par with apple 
festivals, etc.--who was raised on weekend "explores" with 
his father in search of Pinelands plants and animals and their interconnections. 
Though he was born and raised in Audubon, outside our area, his appreciation 
of the Pines as a 
home place is strong and thoughtfully articulated. 
He and 
his father--and the Woodfords--were active proponents of Pinelands preserva-
tion from early on, yet he is appreciative of the role of local people in 
creating the "natural values" that mean so much to him. 
(So is another envir-
onmentalist outsider, Eugene Vivian.) 
Though he is a professionally trained 
biologist, he was inspried to that career by his childhood experiences in the 
Pinelands. 
I 
believe 
we need 
to study this group of Pinelands "users," 
not only because the Pinelands are of great value in their lives, but also 
because they areN ghly articulate and influential segment of the public for 
which the Pinelands Reserve is protected. 
They also played key roles in the 
history of the Pinelands preservation movement. 
As for more "mainstream" lines of investigation, I 
would like to document 
the floral industry's impact in generating a market for the exploitation of 
a diversity of local plants--many in fact non-native weeds. 
I 
would like 
to work with Leo and Hazel Landy "in the field" to see how, where, and when 
they collect the plants they dry and market. 
Elaine and I 
were given samples 
from his stock which Eugene Vivian helped me identify. 
More than thirty 
species are involved, including one rare Pine Barrens endemic. 
Such use of 
local plant resources is perfectly compatible with preservation of the natural 
diversity of the area--some practices, in fact, may enhance that diversity, 
such as moss-pulling--if done on a small scale. 
However, an exponential 
increase in demand could quickly become destructive. 
What are the parameters 
of supply (ecological) and demand (socioeconomic) that e`g`uate this cottage 
industry? 
Does it need more or less` rgeulation? 
Intelligent policy state-
ments require a detailed knowledge of the people, plants, and places involved. 
The fact that to make a living "collecting weeds," as Leo puts it, is hard 
work requiring knowledge, discipline, and committment, may be sufficient to 
regulate its volume to within acceptable levels. 
PFP, report, Hunn, pg. 2 
Trapping is an issue that seems to epitomize the conflict between local 
users of the land and outside preservationists. 
As active in "preservationist" 
efforts in my home area I am sympathetic to that perspective. 
However, some 
10 hours of conversation with Tom and Muriel Brown--Tom Brown, the trapper of 
Milltown, not Tom Brown, the Tracker--I am ready to join the fight to save 
trapping. 
Tom is such an effective and passionate partisan--looking just 
like a 
wood-dwarf and overflowing with homily and doggerel. 
Trapping is his 
life, though he often worked at other trades to earn his livelihood. 
Yet 
the threat to trapping is posed not by the Pinelands Commission or regional 
regulatory bureacracies, but by an organized anti-trapping effort in Trenton. 
At present Tom is despondent; he believes trapping is doomed. 
I 
believe if 
trapping! 
I.outlawed outright or regulated into oblivion, the Pinelands will be 
a lesser Iplace. 
We might investigate further the feasibility of special 
exceptions to allow continued trapping within the Pinelands Reserve by locals. 
Trapping is also a natural for interpretive displays, and Tom Brown's "museum" 
would be a rich resource. 
One point I 
believe well worth further investigation--a point raised as 
well by Christine Cartwright during my all too brief acquaintance with her, 
and by others in their reports--is the subject of "ethnoecology," in other 
words, the systematic study of the local people's knowledge and theory of 
ecological connections. 
Bill Wasiowich, Tom Brown, Leo Landy, Freeman Taylor, 
and Brad Thompson, to name a few people I talked with, all perceive inter-
connections among the activities and needs of people, plants, and animals 
in the Pinelands environment. 
How "accurate" are these perceptions and what 
do they imply for the future impact of local resource use? 
A contribution I might make to the concern for "display" and for yard 
design is in investigating the ubiquitous bird feeder, as a dimension of 
the nature-culture interaction. 
Freeman Taylor of Mt. Misery--a multi-gener-
ation "piney," though all his life a 
wage employee in a local hospital, not 
a 
woodsman--devotes considerable effort and expense (ca. $15 per week for 
bird seen alone) to attract birds and squirrels to his front window. 
His 
yard is full of animals in well-made enclosures--dogs, cats, pigs, pheasants, 
peacocks, pigeons, etc.--and he shares his bedroom with a large timber 
rattlesnake. 
He says they (the animals, and birds) are great company. 
Leo 
Landy describes the birds at their feeders in terms of their assumed qualities 
of character: the harAworking sparrows, the lazy cardinals that drop in and 
stand about as if they expected the sparrows to pick up and crack their seed 
for them, the gentle doves, the aggressive bluejays. 
The bird feeder as 
morality play! 
This establishes a link between locals and "outside envir-
onmentalists" to which a comparison of Elizabeth Woodford's yard with that 
of her friend Freeman Taylor's attests. 
One way to conceptualize the situation is to see the Pinelands as a 
commodity, a resource which may be marketed (exploited) in various ways. 
Cutting cedar or building a retirement community are two conspicuously ob-
vious--and vastly contrasting--examples. 
But the Pinelands phenomenon is 
similarly a marketable commodity for Tom Brown, the tracker, who has par-
layed a childhood experience here into two books, a survival school, and 
a role as cult figure nationwide. 
One could say the same of John McFee, 
or John Sinton, of Elizabeth Woodford--who "sells" her animal rehabilitation 
efforts and nature tours on the strength of her connection with the "Pines"--
and of ourselves. 
We are all making a portion of our living (and/or repu-
tation) by exploiting the Pinelands myth and reality. 
I believe it is useful 
to recognize this commonality of vested interest, of "ulterior motive," if 
you will. 
One more suggestion for systematic analysis: local "ethnosociology," or 
the Pinelands residents' views of themselves and of others, to encompass 
class and ethnic divisions. 
I could not help but be struck by the outspoken 
anti-Black sentiments expressed (quite, if not entirely, freely) by otherwise 
PFP, report, Hunn, Pg. 3 
beautiful people. 
I'm not used to it. 
Perhaps it's an East Coast reality. 
I also noted a certain attitude toward the American Indian: 
both Tom Browns 
exhibited it; the tracker in attributing his wilderness education to an 
Indian Piney! 
the trapper in eulogizing his Indian grandfather and attri-
buting his toughness and woods wisdom to his grandfather's bloodline. 
Where 
I come from it is more likely that the Indian will be the scapegoat of 
preference. 
Though such ethnic stereotyping may not be the side of 
Pinelands culture we should make public, it is nevertheless necessary to 
an honest understanding and appreciation of the local way of life. 
It might be investigated in conjunction with an analysis of what a "Piney" 
is to local residents, as Elaine suggested. 
A special interpretive project I 
would like to see accomplished is the 
publication of a book (or books) describing for the visitor in some detail 
the 
complex of ethnobiological relationships within the Pinelands: perhaps 
to be titled, People, Plants, and Animals in the Pinelands. 
This book should 
list plants and animals of special cultural significance and briefly summarize 
their role in the local cultural ecology, past and present. 
Such a listing 
should be readable but also scientifically and ethnographically accurate, 
and well illustrated. 
Slide presentations and guided nature walks--as at 
Batsto, for example--should be prepared in conjunction with it. 
Other 
chapters should focus on particularly characteristic activities or species, 
such as cedar or Spartina grass, exploring the many ramifications of their 
use, or on particular user-groups, such as trappers or botanists. 
I believe 
such a volume--jointly written by project members and edited by the Library 
staff--could become a popular classic and go far toward heightening outsider 
awareness of the ecological complexities of Pinelands preservation. 
Finally a couple of technical suggestions. 
One, I 
believe we need to 
document our studies of plants and animals by a comprehensive record; of 
plants by collecting voucher specimens to be curated permanently at Rutgers' 
Chrysler Herbarium (they have agreed to this— I hope to make as many collec-
tions as possible during my subsequent visits); of animals by a photographic 
record, unless their scientific identity is unmistakebale. 
Such a record 
is as essential as adequate tape and film documentation as it allows future 
scholars to verify our scientific identifications, and thus properly place 
our ethnographic data in a scientific biological framework. 
It also makes 
possible unambiguous "translation" of local plant and animal names into a 
universally recognized language. 
The Kaypro's were fantastic. 
While it made for many late nights, I 
believe it is invaluable to make one's reports in as much detail as possible 
as soon as possible after the event. 
One can then reflect upon what is now 
safely recorded in retrospect. 
Far better than to rely on one's all too 
fallible memory. 
But I certainly agree, time needs to be set aside for 
logging--equal to the time in the field--and additional time for thinking, 
discussing, and rest. 
The implicit work quota competition game can be 
counterproductive if it porduces an unmanageable mass of poorly connected 
first order data. 
Also, the team research context is synergistic.

Do you see the beak on hire:' 
[referring

Bill Lee classifies these birds somewhat 
differently, 
distinguishing the "blue heron" [this species] from 
"white 
herons," 
also known to him as "egrets," but 
"we 
always 
call 
'ern 
the white heron [apparently restricted 
to 
the 
Great 
Egret, Casmerod i

bUs, see below]. " 
**Great Egret/Casmerodius albus 
Torn 
Brown 
identified 
this 
species 
on 
the 
Corbin 
City 
marshes, 
June 1984, 
as "a big &yret.... 
He's a bruiser, ain't 
he?" 
(PFP84AEHO09-pg. 
15) 
Bill Lee classes this species as 
za 
heron, 
specifically 
as 
the 
"white heron" 
[versus 
the 
"blue 
heron," 
see Great Blue Heron above]. 
"Well, 
the white herons, 
them big tall ones like this, 
they're the egrets. 
Now I don't 
know 
what 
your 
little--we 
always 
called 
'em 
'pokes,'...." 
(PFP84-AEHO1O-pg. 
9) 
"And then your, white birds--the egrets--on 
back 
we had two or three hundred of 'ern there 
[Moore's 
Beach], 
and something happened to 'em. 
I imagine they went to have their 
young 
where they have their, nests--I don't think they have their-
nests around here. 
There the big tall ones, 
like the blue herons 
only they're white. 
We didn't never call 'em 'egrets,' we called 
'ern 'white herons." 
He believes that resident Great Horned Owls 
catch and eat there, 
thinning out their populations. 
Currently he 
sees 15-EO "down Moore's Beach Road."

**Snowy Egret/Egretta thula CC]

an 
"ayret," specifically the "long-legged,

Torn Brown notes that the "geese" [probably this species:EH] bring 
their 
goslings 
up 
on the Corbin City marsh dikes 
to 
feed 
on 
blackberries (Rebus sp.) . He has named a small island in a fresh 
water impoundment here "Goose Island" after the geese that nested 
on it. 
The name has apparently caught on locally. 
DUCK 
Marry references by local people are to ducks in general. 
It 
seems 
likely 
that the mallard or American black duck are 
focal 
images of the typical duck in most peoples minds, 
if not further-
specified. 
Tom Brown describes how State Conservation 
officers 
spray 
cattails 
to 
favor, 
"three-square 
grass" 
(Scirpu 
americanus/S. 
clneyi) to enhance duck habitat, as "three-square" 
is good duck feed. 
Duck hunters are clearly given priority here 
over muskrat trappers. 
Likewise, duck hunting season is allowed 
to 
run 
its course before muskrat trapping season is 
opened 
on 
state tide lands (January 1). 
Torn Brown notes that his neighbor, 
a Mr. 
Burrowin' 
(?) Kirby, 
a schoo teacher, 
is a great 
duck 
hunter. 
Tom 
notes that his son--who now lives in 
California----
couldn't bring himself to trap animals. 
He had a friend that "if 
a duck got up, 
it had to get so far away before he would take 
a 
shot [at it]." 
(PFP83-AEHO03-pg. S) 
Jim 
Stasz 
explains why the Pine Barrens is a poor 
habitat 
for ducks. 
There are few fish for the diving ducks and the acid

"Many of 
a duck 
I've 
caught and cut his leg off where it was broke--if it wasn't broke 
-N

I'd cut it off. 
If it wasn't broke at all, 
I'd 
just take it out of the trap." 
(PFP84-AEHO10-pg.

Bill 
describes 
a good "duck pond" at Moore's Beach that 
was 
spoiled 
when 
a mosquito control diking operation destroyed 
the 
dunes, 
letting 
"that salt come in there,... 
let it ruin it."

George 
Campbell,

destroy

Locally 
known 
as "bobwhite"

"quail" 
(T.

Tom 
Brown leaves food out in his yard for the "quail.'' 
On hunting quail: 
Tom Brown say, 
"Well, I don't like to kill the 
quail. 
I used to kill 'em, 
but I think they're one of my favi•--- 
rite birds, 
the quail.... 
I had a friend that used to whistle, 
and you knew those quail would come runnin'. 
Oh, he had it dowri 
Pat. 
Joe Batholemews.... 
He was a great quail hunter." 
A few 
of his neighbors hunt quail with bird dogs.

Freeman Taylor distinguishes the "bobwhite" from the "quail'' 
Ci. e. , Japanese quail] he raises. 
He does have bobwhite in his-:> 
area. 
According to Tom Brown there was at one time a bounty on fox 
because 
it was believed they took many "game

includinr1 
pheasant and quail.

**Sora/Porzana carolina 
Recorded during count period on the Pinelands Christmas Bird 
Count in 1970. 
The famous "rail bird" sought by rail bird gunners and their 
"pushers" on the Delaware Bay and River shores. 
Favors stands of 
wild rice (Zizania palustris) which occur quite locally, as along 
the Maurice River. 
According to Gerald Parsons of the Library of 
Congress there used to be a famous hunting club, 
"The Sora Club," 
located on the Cohansey R. 
in southwestern New Jersey, 
but it is 
now 
closed for sortie reason. 
The famous painter 
of 
watercolor, 
landscapes, 
Thomas 
Aikens, 
did several famous illustrations of 
railbirding 
on the Co hansey. 
The railbirding season now 
lash:, 
five 
to 
six 
weeks beginning 
the 
first 
of 
September. 
Peak 
conditions 
come on the second to third week in 
September. 
The 
sora 
is the preferred species. 
Though medium sized it migrates 
in abundance and is particularly fat, 
feeding in wild rice stan&:i 
(feeding 
on the seeds) to build fat reserves for 
the 
migratory 
flight, 
initiated 
by the first frost. 
[The Eskimo: Curlew vir-•-
tually exterminated by market gunners by the turn of the 
century 
was 
likewise 
an 
diminutive though abundant and 
extremely 
fat 
migrant. 
Unlike 
the Eskimo Curlew the sora was not 
so 
easily 
killed en masse, thus it was spared and railbirding was preservec:l 
12 
as 
a sport rather than being commercialized . 
EH] 
Jerry 
noted 
that 
scaras 
like tall wild rice (Zizania palustris) 
or 
cattail 
(Typha ), 
and in recent years the invasive "foxtail" (Phragmites). 
"Pushers" must be expert and strong . 
Strength is needed to push 
the 
boat 
into the tall marsh vegetation to flush the rails 
for 
the 
gunner, 
and 
to push the boats right up to 
the 
shallowest 
margin of the marsh, 
where the "butterfly weed" (perhaps 
Ascle-
eias 
lanceolata ) 
grows . 
It provides excellent cover 
for 
their 
birds 
at high tide. 
Railbird pushers must also be able to read 
very subtle features of the marsh . 
for example, 
differences irf 
"elevation" 
and 
areas 
of "floating marsh" 
where 
the 
aquatic 
vegetation has came loose from the bottom. 
Pushers try to 
stay 
out 
of 
such areas as they are like "peanut butter" 
in 
Gerry's 
words . 
Gerald 
notes that the rails are very sensitive to 
tidcr 
shifts . Sot-as will flush readily until the tide turns, then they 
run rather, than flush. 
So rail binding must be timed perfectly, 
done 
just 
before high tide. 
Gerald says that the belief 
that 
rails turn into frogs is still popular. 
"One day the marsh will 
be full of rails, 
the next day, 
no rails, 
but lots of 
frogs'." 
(PFP84-FEHO6`6-pg. `) 
Bill 
Lee on railbirding : 
"Years ago this was the greatest 
place, 
Maurice River . 
They'd always give a man fifty dollars a 
day--far 
to push one man . 
He'd push one man in 
the 
boat. 
I 
don't 
think I ever took two. 
Or I aright take two . 
Cause this:; 
meadow down around Mauricetown , on below here , tide waist-deep on 
the high water . And it 'd be just lined with '

Whatever their-
limit was, 
25 on 30, he'd push ' 
em through there. 
Had sharp C?l 
both ends of his boat, you know . And he'd stand up with this big 
long pole and glide it there. ... 
The snake box is more of a flat 
boat 
and wider, 
that you go duckin ' in and yo u build 
a 
blind. 
And the railbird boat is more narrow and sharp both ends.... 
So 
you 
can push it away and about, 
gain ' around through there

be 
good 
for

FISHES OF SOUTH NEW JERSEY SHORE AND STREAM 
Fishing was of incidental importance to the people EH inter-
viewed with the exception of Bill Lee, 
for whore it was a passion. 
Under the following headings are descriptions by Lee of a variety 
of fishing techniques, 
including purse seining, gill netting with 
a stationary net, eel potting, etc. 
Bill stresses the importance 
of 
a knowledge of the tides for the fisherman. 
He has a set ol-
tide tables for consultation and generally has thern memorized for 
the 
immediate 
future. 
"There's the ' 
phigee' and 
the 
' prbgee' 
[bath g's soft: cf. 
perigee and apogee]. 
There's a perigee first 
and last of July. 
That's when the tides come up high ans 
fast, 
go 
out likewise. 
'Rogee' tides come up slow and not 
high...."

access to marsh resources. 
(PFP84-AEH011-pg. 6) 
Jim Stasz notes:, 
that the native fish fauna of the acid waters of the Fine Barrens

vandals 
by systematically trapping out all the local eel popula-
tion using laundry bags for funnels. 
"So I says, 
if I can't have? 
a eel pot, 
they're not gonna have any eel." 
He claims to 
have 
caught 
2000-3000 eels (at 100-`00/pound) in each of 
four 
bags, 
killed 
and salted them, 
and dumped them in the woods. 
(PFP84-
AEHl16-pg. 2-3) 
Bill and his father marketed large quantities of eels in the 
early days. 
They made their eel traps so that they caught only 
the largest individuals, 
those upwards of 1/2 pound. 
They skin-
ned 
them, 
pack them in `00 pound barrels ( 
one or two barrels 
zi 
week), 
and 
ship them to New York on the 11 AM Monday 
train 
to 
Leesburg. 
They 
worked 
at skinning and packing all

night

Sunday,

which his father objected). 
His dad had a store C?] and 
sc
, 
had 
plenty 
of wooden barrels. 
They got 18-24 
cents 
a pound 
consistently. 
This was cerca 1915-1925. 
"Now Just imagine thc? 
money that you'd get out of 300 pound of eels, 
or 400, and wages 
only 
a dollar a day." 
"Twice a day we'd haul 
this 
seine--the? 
seine maybe as long as your car, 
right fine mesh. 
And we'd put 
it

with.

see, and keep 'em 'till midnight Sunday night. 
Then... 
everybody 
smoked or., chewed tobacco... 
not like 
 
today. 
So, 
I'd 
go around, 
gather up all these cigarett butts,... 
and 
we'd put that in the eels and in abut an hour that'd kill 
every 
one 
of 
'em. 
Dad would skin the big ones and I'd skin 
[1 itt le 
ones] 
like your thumb 
or a little bigger. 
We'd skin '

wouldn't take no time to skin.... 
You take a knife...

below the fins right here you cut through there to the 
backbone. 
And 
you make one slit down here, 
see. 
And then you just 
take 
that, 
all 
the insides conies out like that. 
And then you 
take:? 
your 
knife 
and right here, 
break that backbone, 
push it 
like 
that, 
and you take and pull the hide off. 
And you can skin one? 
that quick, 
quick as I told you my dad would skin an eel." 
Four, 
pounds 
is the largest he can remember his father ever 
catching, 
though they were generally 1/` to one pound. 
"Little ones 
like 
that 
by 
the 
millions. 
 
But they'd not have

"There's 
so much about it

Frill 
describes how mosquito spraying which killed 
off 
the

(Brevoortia) 
"turned everything upside down," 
forcing 
sharks

(Pomatomus saltatrix) to come 
in 
to 
the 
mouths of "criks" to take eels. 
(Ibid.,

Still 
Lee 
uses salted eels to bait his snapping turtle 
anci 
muskrat 
traps. 
For 
the most irresistable 
1ure 
for 
snapping 
turtles 
he stuffs a piece of asafoetida into an eel. 
"I 
don't 
care how far it 
is, 
the snapper's gonna have it, 
he's cumin' at 
it." 
(PFP84-AEHO16-pg.

He covers the traps with 
aquatic:: 
grasses, 
etc., 
to 
keep 
the 
herons from 
stealing 
the 
bait.

Brevoort is tyrannus/Atlantic menhaden 
Bill 
Lee calls them "bunkers" or "musk bunkers," though 
he 
recognizes 
the official name as "menhaden," he doesn't 
use 
it. 
He recounts witnessing a disastrous kill of fingerling bunkers in 
the 
Moore's Beach area in the 1930's or 1940's which 
he 
attri-•- 
bates 
to 
the 
hated Mosquito Control 
Commission's 
ill-advised 
spraying Cthus supporting a rather later date for the 
disaster]. 
His 
dramatic description of the bunkers "last day" is 
powerful. 
He 
describes 
fishing in the evening with the young bunkers 
anc:l 
weakfish so abundant that they splashed him in the boat thrashing 
with their tails. 
He returned to his nets just before dawn, where 
he notes an odd whiteness to the water and a great stillness. 
As 
dawn breaks he sees that there is nothing but dead fish as far as:> 
the eye could see--for miles in every direction.

(PFR84---

Of bunkers Bill says, 
"They made the greatest, 
finest 
oil 
there 
was [and used for fertilizer], 
and the fish was scimething 
that 
renewed 
itself. 
[They aren't especially good

Didn't cost anything. 
And 
there was hundreds of fish factories.

And when the bunkers disappeared, all this equip-

and that, 
one thing and another--but it turned everything upside

I don't

Bill 
attempts 
to convey the numbers of menhaden 
prior 
to 
this 
ecological disaster by describing a giant school of bunkeri::> 
25-30 
miles 
long and marry miles wide. 
[He also described 
the 
abundance 
of 
striped bass or "rock" by saying 
that 
they 
were:: 
"thick 
as 
bunkers. " 
So 
they're 
the 
standard 
for^ 
super-
abundance. I 
Eleven or twelve boats from Wi ldwood, 
25-30 
boatt-> 
from 
Delaware 
out of Lewes, 
"they all come in this 
school 
of 
bunkers. 
What they done,... 
they were smart, 
the captains 
o-
these 
beats. 
They 
wouldn't 
go right in the

that

They would make a set on the edge. 
And... 
for thc•? 
200 fathoms of the troll--not a troll, a purse--they would have a

And their buddy, they'd call him in,

They'd both get 
a 
load, 
from just one set like that. 
And they fish there from 
June all through the summer, 
day after, day after day, 
and 
they 
still 
didn't 
lower that school of bunker." 
In those 
days, 
a  
that 
season, 
menhaden was the main target 
of 
fishing. 
"They 
might be a day gettin' out there, gettin' started and everything, 
but when they loaded, 
they come straight in." 
(RFP84-AEH010-pg. 
c-3) 
He used to catch 50 bushels a day, 
50-60 fish per bushel, 
gat 
$1.25 
per bushel. 
He caught there with a four 
inch 
mesh 
(pronounced 
"mash") net. 
Yesterday (E0 June 1984) he caught 10 
pounds 
of bunkers along with 66 pounds of weakfish and sold 
the 
lot to Bailey's in Fort Elizabeth. 
(PFR84-FEHO621-pg. 
c) 
This:s 
was 
a major 
industry from the turn of the 
century 
until 
the 
disaster he describes, ca. 
1930-1940s. 
(RFP84-FEHO621-pg. 
1) 
He 
describes 
the bunker population as essential 
food 
for 
many 
important 
food fishes of Delaware Bay, 
such 
as 
weakfish 
(Cynoscion 
regalis) and striped bass 
(Morone 
saxatilis). 
See 
PFP84-AEH010,

"These bunkers, well, there were so many of 
'em, 
and everything feeds on bunkers, 
from the seanul1, ... 
[to 
the] sharks. 
We've opened many a shark [EH believes he said the 
same 
of the weakfish] and found 40-50 bunkers in 
it, 
and 
they 
claimed they'd eat a bushel a day, 
these big sharks, 
you know." 
Bill 
sees a link between the weakfish and the bunkers, 
as 
they 
came 
in to spawn between Moore's Beach and Reed's Beach at about 
the same time, 
generally May and June. 
Bunkers are small fish. 
"A pound bunker's a big bunker. 
I don't know as I ever, saw one 
4 
weighed 
two 
pound." 
Bill uses bunkers and eels 
as 
bait 
for 
snapping turtle and muskrat traps. 
Jahn 
Bailey, 
proprietor 
of Bailey's fish market 
in 
port 
Elizabeth 
explained his operation as we (EH R MH) 
watched 
the 
processing 
of 
a small load of menhaden, 
most about 6-8 
inches 
long. 
He 
sells 
them 
for crab bait. 
They 
are 
packaged 
iri 
cardboard 
flats 
lined with plastic, 
each weighing 
50 
pounds, 
selling for $9.00/flat or ca. 
$0. 19/pound. 
Crabbers come arounc:l 
to 
pick it up fresh. 
So his business is very dependent on 
the 
state 
of 
the 
crab fishery. 
There 
were 
a 
few 
weakfish, 
tY 
bluefish, and a butterfish mixed with the lot of menhaden, but he 
said 
they 
weren't marketable because they smelled 
of 
bunkers, 
having been mixed with them.

His explanation:

who 
knew and liked the bluefish have died off. 
They should 
be 
cooked fresh. 
Bill says that bluefish are normally a main fooc:l 
of 
sharks. 
He suggests that the bluefish were killed or driven 
off 
by the spraying which he believes destroyed 
local 
menhadeni 
populations, 
forcing 
sharks to feed inshore on 
eels.

He sells them to Bailey's in

says 
the weakfish "croaks," and when a large number of 
them 
are "singing" it makes a whirring noise, quite different from the;? 
"boom, 
boom, 
boom" of the black drum (Pogonias 
cromis). 
Bill 
says 
weakfish and menhaden spawn only on the Delaware Bay share, 
in 
May, 
June. 
Local people learned to catch weakfish 
from 
a 
Swedish 
immigrant 
fisherman, 
Harry Anderson, 
Bill's uncle 
by

marriage, after the turn of the century. 
(PFP84-AEH010-pg. 2,

Weakfish 
and "bunkers" (=menhaden Brevo--rtis tyrannus) 
are: 
associated 
in 
Bill Lee's view, 
as they both used to 
spawn 
iri 
great 
numbers 
on 
the Delaware Bay shore 
between

and

Weakfish also eat bunkers as Bill claims

mosquitos, 
probably in the 1940's, 
according to Bill. 
(PFP84-AEH010-pg.

Bill 
describes 
how he and his father used 
to 
catch 
1000 
pounds a night. 
Other fishermen worked all day to bring in just 
100-200 pounds or so. 
"But we'd make ten, fifteen set during the 
night 
and 
get our 1000 pound 
or so.... 
Made ' 
ern 
[the 
other, 
fishermen] mad. 
They was gonna burn out boat up, 
put acid on our 
nets...." 
But Bill and his father showed one of the leaders 
of 
this 
opposition 
how 
to set 
their 
nets 
properly, 
apparently 
avoiding trouble. 
He and his wife more recently have teamed 
up 
to 
fish for weakfish at night. 
He sets his net parallel to the 
beach with a light on each end, 
offshore perhaps 100-.00 
yards. 
"Then we'd come in here, up and down, wide open, 
like 
 a big roll, 
around and around, 
and then drive the fish to the net, 
and there 
pull. 
Then we'd go to another spot. 
Six big sets. 
And we'd get 
[maybe] 
500 pound a set.... 
And we didn't bother 
hit-or-miss. 
We 
knew 
where 
the 
sand bars was and 
the 
gullies, 
slews 
or 
sloughs, whatever you want to call 'em, the deep spots, you know, 
and 
then that's where we'd fish a bunch up...." 
(RFp84-AEHO10-

Weakfish, 
like bluefish, 
are "gilled," unlike "butterfish" 
or "flounder. " Thus they can be caught in a gill 
net. 
(PFP84--
AEHOiG-pg. 
10) 
Bill 
recalls how he got started 
fishing, 
for 
weakfish 
first of all. 
He had earned $120 on his muskrat 
trap 
line during the eighth grade. 
His sister--ten years older--took 
his 
money 
and 
ordered 
some nets 
through 
the 
Sears 
Roebuck. 
catalog. 
"And when it come, 
it was a box, 
parcel post, you know. 
And honest to goodness, that net must a been a half mile long.... 
We had a little Sears and Roebucks putt-putt motor, we had a two-
and-a-half, not a four, horse [power]. 
It'd go putt, 
putt, 
putt. 
We'd go up in the marsh, 
seven or eight mile up there, 
and hour-
up and a hour back, 
took them fish up there every 
day.... That'sS 
when I was a kid, thirteen, fourteen year old. 
And it started us 
in fishin'."

Tom Brown has a "snapper shell" in his 
"trapper's 
Museum" 
that was decorated by an artist friend. 
He has another -, 
shell of a 47 pound snapping turtle. 
Tom recalled that, he "went 
snapperin' 
with a fellow this year, 
and I really had 
a 
ball.'' 
(PFP83-AEHO04-pg.

George Campbell, 
Sr., 
recommended a Bill 
Lee 
as an old-time "snapperer" who might be willing to talk. witt•i 
EH. 
Tom Brown confirmed that Bill Lee was such and introduced EH 
at 
Bill's daughter-in-law's house in Mi l 
lvi l 
le where he and 
hisi> 
wife 
were 
staying 
at 
the 
time 
(June 
1584). 
Tom 
had 
a 
"loggerhead 
snapper" down in his basement (June 
1984). 
Here'i::> 
how 
he 
got 
it: 
'Well, 
it come up in 
the 
field, 
I guess. 
[George?] 
Delay, 
friend 
of mine's field, 
and 
he 
caught 
it. 
That's 
what he does a lot in the spring. 
This year he went all 
the way to Maine, 
took his boat, 
13 traps [for snapping turtle7, 
and his four-wheel drive pul l 
in' 
his trailer.... 
He got ' 
em [the 
turtles] to sell.... 
[but] he caught a total of two...." Cappar-•-
ently his inside dope was faulty:EH7 
More typically this 
friend 
of Tom Brown's 
 would catch 600 to 1000 pounds a week, put them iri 
barrels and sell them for $0.45/pound, 
live weight. 
Toni had a fyke [snapping turtle trap] under construction 
irl 
his 
back yard during EH's June visit. 
Also involved is a 
bait 
box. 
"This'll be my bait box. 
When I get it done I'll have the:,, 
lid come down, 
I' l 
l put a couple pieces of bunker (i . 
e. , Atlantic 
menhaden, 
Brevoortia) 
in 
there, 
and I'll hang this on a wire:? 
right down here [inside the fyke7. 
I'll cut this section out so 
I can reach down in there. 
Now if you got one in here Cin 
they 
fyke7 that you wanta get, 
a lot of times you gotta take a little 
ba11peen 
hammer 
and tap him on the nose. 
Just stun 
him 
1ongi 
enough to get ahold of the tail and get him out of there.... 
In 
the pond... 
what we do is put a gallon jug on the back there 
ti i 
i 
keep 
that 
[far end of the fykel up, 
just so the 
turtle 
won't 
drown. 
That'll 
leave a little air, space in there." 
 
Tom 
notes 
that Bill Lee sometimes sets out up to 15 traps, and sometimes he: 
will catch three or four, snappers at a time [per trap?:EH]. 
And 
Bill's 
wife 
might 
catch as many again as 
Bill 
did. 
(PFP84-
AEHO09-pg. 
3-4) 
Sometimes 
carp will get caught in 
the 
fyke. 
"Usually 
the snappers kill there while they're in 
there.... 
If 
they're dead, why we just leaves ' 
em in there for more bait. " He 
also 
• sometimes 
catches raccoons 
 in snapper 
traps, 
where 
they 
may drown. 
Tam Brown notes that snappers have seven kinds of meat. 
He 
had 
snapper 
soup 
and fried snapper the 
night 
before. 
"It'r:s 
better than any chicken, 
it's really delicious." 
(PFP84-AEHO09-
pg. 
6) 
A good place to trap snappers is along a bank in 
water--
lily (Nyphaea) pads. 
Toni pointed out the locations of three of 
his 
snapper 
traps 
of previous 
seasons. 
He 
complained 
that 
someone 
had come along and cut them in half with cutting pliers. 
He 
figured 
that whoever it was thought he 
was 
"infringin' 
on 
their trappin'."

Bill 
Lee 
on 
snappering: 
Surnmertime 
work. 
He 
trapped 
muskrat 
during the winter. 
"In the summertime snapperin' 
over-
there 
in there impoundments, 
every inch of it from on the 
other 
side below Petersburg, 
you know, 
all the way up to Corbin City. 
Every one of the ponds got tons and tons of snappers in 'ern. 
And 
she 
[who?:EHI used to go when I had like a party 
boat. 
I ruri 
parties for 20 years out on Maur-ice River, 
see, and she would 
 go 
and catch there snappers. 
My gosh, 
some day she'd have four and 
five 
hundred 
pound. 
and 
some 
of ' 
ern' d weigh 
20-30 
pounds 
apiece." 
On fyke nets: 
"When I was a 
little 
 
fellow, 
seven, 
eight 
years 
old, 
I went to work and I netted myself a snapper 
fyke. 
Now there's one snapper fyke. 
See this? 
Now look, 
yol_t 
wouldn't 
believe 
that was done by 
hand, 
without 
a measuring 
stick. 
I done 
every 
on of 'ern like 
 this. 
By 
hand." 
Bill. 
demonstrated his technique, measuring by the feel of his fingers, 
about a three-inch mesh. 
He says the start is the most difficult 
part. 
You have to make twice as many meshes to start. 
He uses 
"fishermen's 
bend" knots. 
He can net six feet of net in 
about 
two day. s, 
to finish the fyke. 
He makes four grapevine hoops to 
hold the net in place--a cylindrical trap with a funnel formed at 
the fore end. 
The "top" of the fyke--the far end--is set out of 
the water so that just the funnel entrance is below the 
surface. 
He puts a bait string in the middle. 
(PFP84-AEHO10-pg. 5-6) 
The 
snapper 
goes in after the bait and can't find his way out, 
them 
his 
shell "fetches up" in the net. 
To get there out you 
simply 
undue the knot at the far end and dump hire out. 
Then pick it 
ura 
by 
the 
tail and put it in the bag and tie it 
up. 
One 
day 
he 
caught nine in one fyke, 
each weighing about 15 pounds, which at 
$0.25-0.40/pound 
comes 
to 
$45 for the day. 
You 
have 
to 
be 
careful 
to 
tie the upper end well as the turtles can 
work 
thc;? 
knots loose and escape. 
Bill also cites oak and hickory as good 
durable 
woods 
to use for the fyke frame (in addition 
 
to 
grap(7:•+ 
vine) 
(PFP84-AEHO16-pg. 
2) 
He sets traps both in tidal 
meadow 
and 
in fresh-water pond. 
In the pond he doesn't need to 
worry 
about the tide rising and drowning the turtle, 
which 
considera-
tion must be calculated in setting fyke on the tidal meadow. 
Yo1_i 
2 
can catch more and more easily in the pond, 
but people steal your, 
catch there. 
Bill pulls up aquatic vegetation, such as wild rice 
Rizania) 
to cover his fykes so that herons won't come and 
take 
the 
bait. 
The most powerful bait is a fingertip-sized piece of 
"asafoetida" stuffed inside a piece of salted eel. 
You but 
thc:a 
asafoetida 
at 
the 
drug store. 
"Same people 
don't 
like 
the 
smell.... 
So anyhow, 
I don't care how far it 
is, 
the snapper's.> 
gonna have it; 
he's cumin' at it." 
But you must, of course, set 
your fyke so that the funnel mouth is downstream (with respect tc, 
tide 
flow and/or wind direction), 
s•• the turtle can follow 
the 
scent 
into 
the 
trap. 
Bill describes the 
tricks 
involved 
irl 
setting 
fykes on tidal meadows. 
If you set on the 
flood 
tide 
(i. e. , as 
it's coming in) your fyke may get all full of mud ancJ 
the 
funnel may be pushed open and out of position. 
Setting 
on 
the 
ebb 
tide 
is 
better, 
so long as 
the 
funnel 
is 
pointec:l 
downstream. 
Bi ll also 
 knows how to use eddies so that he can get 
an ebb-like flow on the flood tide. 
He also has learned to 
tie, 
the 
funnel mouth rather tight. 
His father left it loose hoping 
to catch the larger turtles, 
but bill 
has learned that the 
birl 
ones 
will simply force their way in through a tight 
funnel. 
A 
tight 
funnel also prevents the smaller ones from escaping. 
"01••i 
snappers--I've caught thousands and thousands, 
of 'em. 
Will, I 
guess hundreds of tons, anyway." 
He recalls as a kid how hid dacl 
and 
he 
and his little brother (who never did his share 
of 
the 
work!) 
would pack snappers in barrels for 
shipment, 
earning 
a 
penny 
or two, a pound after freight and commission costs had been 
deducted for the going price of four cents a pound. 
Bill caught 
a hundred pounds a week and made maybe a dollar or two.

20

He keeps it in a 55 gallon terrarium in

It is not defanged. 
Nevertheless Freeman has no fear, 
of it and freely picks it up and carries it around. 
(see photos: 
PFP83-CEHO04 - #27 - 29) 
He 
set it down on the living room 
floor, 
then 
nudged it with his shoe to make it rattle so EH could 
tape 
record the sound. 
"Rattle, come on!" he said, by way of encour•-•- 
agement. 
He believes that these rattlesnakes are thought to 
be 
deadly 
( 
and 
may 
be) 
only because people "torment 
•rment 
them." 
 
Hea 
recalls that, 
"we always picked them up, turned them loose, never 
10 
killed them. 
They can give yo u a nasty bite. 
A man brought two 
from Florida, 
said they'd bite. 
I picked there up with no

it, 
although it's against the law. 
(PFP83-AEH007-pg.

rattlesnakes 
are beneficial as they eat "rodents and rats."

had so me rats around

He 
had a rattlesnake in the rock pile out by his fish pond, 
but 
it went away (they like rock piles , he explains).

The success 
of 
his 
business 
depends heavily on the crab fishery. 
MH interrogated Mr. Bailey 
on 
the crab business. 
Bailey said that he dealt in "soft-shell 
crab," 
which 
is just a crab that has recently shed 
its 
shell. 
All crabs shed, 
he notes, that's how they grew. 
They may double 
their 
size 
or more each time they shed. 
A crab 
just 
before 
shedding 
is called a "peeler," then it 
is a "shedder." 
Within 1 
1/2 
hours after shedding the skin hardens to the consistency 
of 
paper, so timing of harvest is critical. 
Crabs at that stage are 
known as "white crabs" or "poor crabs" [perhaps because they have.? 
used 
up their reserves of flesh in shedding? 
EH], 
a condition 
lasting 
two 
to three weeks. 
Then they're "blue crabs" 
again. 
(PFP84-FEHO624-pg. 2) 
John Bailey notes that the crab fishery on Delaware Bay 
has 
been poor since 1976, 
which he attributes to cold winters. 
Whert 
"crabs gave out 
it make a big change." 
Marry people were put out 
of 
work; 
many 
switched to fishing at that 
time. 
John 
rate 
"Jersey 
crab" superior in hardiness to "Maryland" or "Chesapeake 
crabs." 
They don't taste better but they "don't die off on 
yoi_t 
so readily" so are more profitably marketed. 
There are sometimes 
complex 
exchanges of crabs for market between Maryland 
and 
Jew 
Jersey crabbers. 
Catching crabs depends a lot on the wind, 
as 
"they move on a south wind 
squat on a north wind,

Diptera

mosquito 
The 
issue 
of 
spraying 
to 
control 
mosquitos 
is 
highly 
controversial. 
See 
especially 
Bill 
Lee's commentary 
on 
t 
hc:? 
massacre of the menhaden on the Delaware Bay shore. 
Bill claims 
that spraying directed by the Cape May County Mosquito Commission 
(directed 
by a man named "Freddie") was responsible for 
killing 
all the crickets, grasshoppers, the small birds that fed on them, 
as 
well 
as menhaden and weakfish young, 
and the 
bluefish 
and 
striped 
bass that fed on the smaller fish. 
Bill explains 
that: 
the 
Mosquito 
Control people examined aerial photographs 
 of 
the 
marshes 
and 
mistook the fingerling menhaden 
and 
weakfish 
for, 
mosquitos!

Jack Cervetto says they have a "very little mosquito" around 
Warren Grove (but not the same as the

He 
keeps 
them both off by rubbing kerosene

The smell drives there off. 
"The mosquitos can't 
stand it and none of them flies can't." 
Another technique he has 
used 
to 
keep mosquitos away--before they had

repellent

t

• burn 
little

Tern Brown says that, 
"the mink is just about a thing of the past

I caught five mink,

one day.... 
Over a little stream over there I caught four 
in 
four days,

I reset it and every morning I had 
a

mink 
in there.... 
I imagine they were out

I'd say.... 
I don't try 
to 
catch mink anymore because I would 
 rather leave 'ern alone.... 
I see a mink track, 
I'm gonna steer away from it .... 
Usually a 
mink is 
pretty shy; he will avoid the muskrat sets.... 
I caught 
most of the mink in flying sets,

down, 
and that's where I would trap."

"I

Tom refers to the otter as "Mister Otter," as a 
mark of respect and affection. 
"He's smart enough to • 
stay out of 
that 
trap 
himself, 
so 
he doesn't 
worry 
about 
inadvertently 
trapping 
them in his muskrat sets. 
He did catch one once. 
"I

owner 
would carve a coon hide stretcher of wood, 
the dog 
would 
run 
out 
immediately and come back with a coon 
just

In

Tom told of a tragic 
accident 
in which a local boy had been killed when he ran int o a 
truck 
on 
his 
motorcycle. 
Tom r efers to 
motorcycles 
as 
the 
"Japanese revenge." 
The boy had done some trapping and had 
some-:?

The bo y' s dog "missed him, so he went out and brought

"Dog" is a trappers' term for a moveable part of a trap that 
folds over the "pan" in the set. 
(PFP83-AEHO0 `-pg. 9) 
Trapping with snares, 
Indian style, 
is illegal, 
Tom Brown 
says, because of the problem of catching domestic animals such ass 
dogs. 
On catching dogs in traps: 
Tom Brown recounts, 
"I 
was 
bragging here the other year, I was graggin' that I hadn't caught 
a dog in 18 years. 
And then I wound up with three. 
They were 
able to release. 
They were rennin' deer. 
They had no businesss 
bein' out there. 
One of ' 
em was a german 
shepherd.... 
another 
just 
a mongrel.... 
The German shepherd had a studded 
collar-, 
on.... 
wieghed 
about a hundred and ten pounds--big." 
Tom 
then 
described 
how 
he releases a potentially dangerous dog 
using 
al 
choker 
or a noose to put over the dog' s nose. 
"There's so many 
wild dogs, and they are really mean, because they have no fear of 
man, ... 
an 
they will come after you. " Tom says the State 
will 
trap problem wild dogs, but that mostly 
ly they're shot by hunters. 
Taylor 
used to "run foxes" with hounds, 
but he didn't kill 
them. 
He used to have 25-30 hounds. 
His brother, Norman Taylor, 
keeps 
2 0-25 "deer-proof dogs" and "breaks" two to three 
puppies 
each 
year. 
But trapping is a problem. 
According to 
Freeman, 
"Peop le 
 got to setti ng steel traps, 
snares, 
sno us es, 
so I just 
quit runnin' em altogether, cause you just lose a good dog. 
Make 
you 
disgusted." 
Freeman's sister married a man named 
Meredith 
who 
pays as high as $3000-4000 for a good dog. 
This man's son, 
"has got all the money he needs.... 
If he sees a good dog he'll 
buy it. 
He's got a big place dose on the plains. 
Spent $40,000 
on

(PFP83-
AEHO07-pg.

According to Freeman, a dog that can only run for-
three to four hours isn't "a dog at all." 
They should be able to 
run 
a fox from six AM till 6 PM and be getting 
stronger. 
They

Tom 
Brown responds to the claims of fox hunters that 
traps 
harm their dogs. 
"We used to have trouble with the fox and coori 
and the houndsmen, we'd call 'em, 
but then we got together and we 
figured 
that 
if 
the 
trappers and the 
houndsmen 
didn't 
hang 
together, 
we 
was 
gonna hang separately.... 
The head 
of 
the

that 
he's 
had 
several of his dogs caught and released with no

They'll eat the bait after they dig it out, after they're 
caught. 
(PFP83-AEHO02-pp. 
7-8) 
Tom says that the most humane? 
way 
to dispatch an animal in a trap is to stun it and then 
stop 
the heartbeat, 
rather than to shoot it, 
though he carries a 
rifle for that purpose. 
"A tot of the anti's don't like 
 to hear 
this, but I have shot animals between the eyes and then they kick 
and 
struggle.... 
but I don't like to see the struggle. 
I just 
take my walking stick and crack a fox over the head and then 
put 
one foot to held his head down and the other foot back of the rib 
cage and that's it. 
They never come to." 
(PFP83-AEHOO2-pg.

Tom 
recounts how a young local trapper, 
Jack 
Snyder, 
believed 
there were no fox in the local area, 
thus didn't try to trap for-, 
them, 
had never caught one. 
However, Tom showed him how to read 
signs, such as tracks and droppings, to determine if and where tci 
set traps for fox, and the next year he wound up with `1 fox.

steel

traps 
are outlawed there will be no effective way to control fox 
populations [or those of other animals]. 
"You need the

Tom has about 75 fox traps as the most he can ten for fox is 
35-40 at one time. 
(PFP83-AEHO03-pg.

He no longer lets his 
grandchildren 
touch raccoon or fox carcases for fear of 
rabies. 
Tom recounts how a friend had been out "spy 
Ott in' deer" one 
night 
[without 
his gun!] when "this fox come right up to the car, 
and 
kept gain' 'round the car." 
He didn't shoot it because he didn't 
have 
his gun, 
but figured it had rabies. 
Wild animals 
acting 
friendly are suspect. 
On the difference between red and gray fox: 
You can tell by 
the tracks. 
(Tom Brown 
 pointed one out to EH in the smooth sand 
along his driveway.) 
The gray fox is "like a cat--small." 
"And 
one 
foot 
ahead 
of the other." 
"The red fox is the size 
of 
a 
small rabbit hound--it's a much bigger track." 
Red foxes 
gener-
ally grew larger than grays. 
A large fox (species?) weighs 10-11. 
pounds. 
(T. 
Brown, PFP83-AEHO03-pg. 
13) 
Tom continues, 
"A gray 
fox 
is more like the cat, 
and the red is more like the 
dog.... 
The gray for, can climb a tree, 
the red can't." 
The two 
species 
sound 
alike. 
Gray 
foxes catch mice, 
moles, 
and "stuff 
like..? 
that." 
They also like fruit, such as chicken grapes, fox grapes, 
and persimmons. 
The red fox "would get more rats and rabbits and 
stuff like that." 
(PFP83-FEH1010-pg. 4; PFP83-AEH008-pg. 
10) Tom 
Brown recalls just once seeing a "silver fox," 
" [presumably 
 a red 
fox 
of the black color phase]. 
This was back in the '60's when 
one ran across 
 the road in front of their truck. 
He was 
rid inr;1 
with his old friend Morris Pankis, 
who at first mistook it for a 
big cat. 
On 
stretchers: 
use one larger that the #5 used

Processing does not normally involve washing the pelt, 
unless it 
was muddied.

fox and 1L-15 raccoon. 
(He used to

Traps often set for fox in the middle of old little travelled

One such of his traps was stolen, 
and the thieves 
left 
the discarded spotlight 
 box nearby. 
Fox used to have a bo unty on them. 
Tom Brown used to catch 
them 
just for the bounty, 
when fox was out of fashion 
and 
the.? 
furs were worthless Cwhen?:EH7. 
The bounty was $3.50, minus a 50 
cent fee for paperwork to the "JP" (Justice of the Peace) . The JPI 
would 
then 
punch right inside the ear so that "if you 
took 
it 
somewhere 
else and they looked, 
they'd knew--because a 
lot 
of 
times 
they 
were col1ectin', 
sometimes three times on the 
same 
one. 
You could then keep the skin, 
"but there wasn't no sale.'' 
The bounty was justified by the claim that the foxes were getting 
game birds such as pheasant, quail, and rabbits.

Down on the state meadow, that's really the place to see.... 
The

The reason we pull out [before the official

start 
rnatin', 
and 
when 
they start matin' the males are fighting 
and 
they get cut up--oh, they get cut up bad.... 
[They start mating] 
around the end of February, 
if it's warm." 
(PFP83-AEHO08-ppG-7) 
Tom's trapping schedule usually begins with fox, 
etc., 
shifting 
to just muskrat when that season opens. 
The state delays muskrat 
trapping season "to give the duck hunters a chance." 
Tom 
not es that cold weather can be a problem as "your traps 
might 
be frozen in on the first day Coif the season] and you 
may 
not 
get there out until after the season closes." 
So 
a trapper 
needs to •

traps for muskrat. 
The "stop-loss" is the guard that comes over-, 
and holds the animal so it can't twist its leg off and get loose.

According to Torn, 
"You'll catch

(PFP83-AEHOO2--pp.

argues against the Anti's in favor of steel

traps:

Tom Brown owns 175 muskrat 
traps 
of 
two 
types. 
One kind is a #110 killer trap, 
which 
is 
now 
illegal. 
 
Killer traps can only be used with a permit for beaver 
and 
otter 
and must be set under 
water. 
(PFp83-AEHOO4-pg.

Some 
trappers 
may set out as marry as 100 
at 
one

Trap 
preparation 
involves 
rusting, 
waxing, 
and dyeing. 
"The 
dye 
colors 
'ern

Dyeing 
is with

Brawn on "staking" a trapping area: 
Trap 
stakes 
are 
made 
of

to 
it. 
Some 
trappers come out the first day of the season and "put the stakes

Processing 
involves 
col lecting the rats in a burlap 
bag, 
bringing them home, 
making sure they're dry, 
then skinning them 
out. 
"I take a lot •

we do have like the Abbots over in Maryland. 
They can skirl 
three or four rats a minute.

On eating muskrat: 
"Actually, 
a muskrat is the best 
meat 
there 
is, 
as far as the vitamins and stuff that's in 
it, 
see.

they 
only

over in Hancock's Bridge and them places.... 
They 
cook 
' 
em by the hundreds over there,

ern. " "Muskrat, 
I tell 
you, 
they're 
better than rabbit--much better. 
They're a moist 
meat. 
I like 
 'ern fried nice and brown. 
There's demand. 
You can 
sell 
every 
one you catch." 
A muskrat has a pound 
of 
meat 
or 
better, 
full grown. 
"The hind legs and the saddle 
is about all 
I can eat Cof the muskrat] . 
" In the old days you could but 
the:+ 
carcases 
for 5 cents apiece. 
Tom used to • 
sell there three for a 
dollar, 
now sells there for $0.50, 
though they go for $1.00-1.25 
in the stares.

to 
eat later.  
However,

15 March 1985 
The 
body 
of this report is a compilation of references 
of 
ethnobiological interest in my field notes and cassette tape logs.i 
covering four short field trips to the Pinelands Reserve area 
in 
October 
and December of 1983 and March and June of 1984. 
A few 
species lists and general references have also been cited, though 
by no means exhaustively. 
It is my belief that it will be useful. 
to 
add 
to 
the 
material 
collated 
here 
cross-references 
to 
information 
in 
the 
files of other PFP researchers and 
in 
the? 
published 
literature. 
When that has been 
done, 
the 
American 
Folklife Center will have an encyclopedic index of information or-1 
Pinelands

from 
which interpretive 
materials 
and 
scientific analyses could be readily generated. 
The 
body 
of

NJMAMMAL contains 76k, 
NJBIRD 
84k, 
NJHERP 
36k, 
NJFISH 30k, 
and NJINVERT 30k. 
The files refer in 
some way to over 600 species of plants and animals. 
Each file ii: 
arranged 
in a standard scientific taxonomic 
order. 
The 
plant 
list, 
for 
example, 
includes all major taxonomic divisions and, 
within the vascular plant group, 
is broken down by family,

where 
it

These consultants are all (unfortunately) male, a 
bias that can be corrected by reference to the notes of the other , 
PFP 
field 
workers. 
They are otherwise representative 
of 
the 
regional diversity of residence and socio-ecological 
background. 
For example, 
woods workers such as Cervetto and Wasiowich may be 
contrasted 
with 
bay and marsh oriented people such as 
Campbell. 
and Lee. 
Locally "educated" old-timers 
 such as Bill Lee, Brown, 
Taylor, 
and Cervetto contrast with younger, college-educated Jim 
St asz 
and Egad Thompson. 
The business orientation of 
Leo 
and 
Hazel 
Landy, 
the 
Campbell 
family, 
and Brad Thompson 
may 
br:.? 
compared with the more avo 
scat i 
o 
Ana l or ientation
 
   
 of Freeman Taylor, 
Torn Brown, and Jim St as z 
. 
The 
diversity 
of these orientations strikes me as a major 
distinguishing 
characteristic 
of culture 
in 
the 
contemporary 
United 
States in comparison to that of the "primitive" and "pea-
sant" societies that cultural anthropologists have 
traditionally 
studied. 
Each 
consultant has developed his own cultural inven-
tory 
suited to his own needs and growing out of his 
own 
unique 
experience. 
Thus what is known (i . 
e. , cultural content) and how 
that 
cultural know ledge
 
 
 is named (nomenclature) 
 and conceptually 
organized varies a great deal from individual to individual. 
The 
Pinelands 
has no single culture, 
nor does it have two 
distinct: 
cultures, 
as argued by David Cohen, 
but it is rather a skein of 
overlapping 
cultural "maps " of a single underlying reality. 
0wi 
coherently 
describe 
such a cultural "net" and its 
relation 
to 
reality 
is a difficult challenge for 
contemporary 
anthropology 
and related disciplines. 
At present, 
the data summarized here is a set of intriguing 
points 
of 
intersection 
between 
humanity 
and 
the 
natural. 
environment. 
On 
further 
reflection, 
these 
points 
may 
be 
synthesized to generate theoretically significant conclusions, 
or-
suggest productive lines for further inquiry. 
For example, 
the 
local 
 
plant 
 
and 
animal 
nomenclature 
provides 
i 
nt erect i 
nq 
comparisons 
with 
patterns of folk and

that are of considerable interest to the study of.folk biological. 
classification 
 (E. 
Hunn, American Ant h 
r• 
ego 10g i 
st 84:830-847). 
Of 
particular 
interest 
is the way a loose set of terms appears 
to 
get 
assigned to species or varieties variously depending on 
the? 
socio-ecological 
context. 
While Tom Brown and 
Jack 
Cervetto, 
2 
bath 
accomplished 
woodsmen, 
each 
recognize 
and 
name 
three 
"species" 
of local pines, 
Tom distinguishes "bull " or 
"pitch," 
from 
"smooth-bark" 
and 
"spruce pines" 
while 
Jack 
recce 
•gnizes 
"bull," "pitch," and "dwarf" or "scrub pines." 
Tom 's three pineiii> 
are the three native species PinMy rigida, 
R_ 
echinata, 
and P,_. 
v
- iroiniana, while Jack's are all ecotypes of a single species, P... 
rigida. 
The names utilized overlap--they are drawn from a common 
folk 
English inventory, 
but the conceptual realities so labeled 
are quite different. 
Cervet t 
o' s immediate environment 
 has 
less-ii

but his involvement 
with 
woods

is more direct.

huckleberries and snakes, and Bill Lee on shorebirds. 
A 
pervasive habitat contrast 
 structures local  peoples' 
un-
derstanding 
of 
ecology 
and is evident in 
their 
nomenclature. 
This 
is the "upland"-"bog/meadow/share" distinction. 
There 
Q[ 
"sweet" and "salt" hay (G. 
Campbell, Sr.), upland (red) cedar and 
swamp 
(white) cedar (various), 
swamp "bull pine" versus 
upland 
"pitch pine" Q. 
Cervetto), 
upland and swamp huckleberries, and 
upland versus meadow trapping strategies (B. 
Lee, 
T. 
Brown). 
It 
sometimes 
appears as if there are "upland" and 
"bog/meadow/bay" 
people as well, even distinct cultures (D. 
Cohen), as people suct•1 
as 
Jack 
Cervetto 
seem to rarely visit 
the 
bay 
(though 
it's 
scarcely 
ten 
miles 
from his home) and Bill Lee has 
a 
limited 
interest in and experience with the woods. 
However, others such 
as 
Tom Brawn move between these major environmental 
 
rooms 
se a
-
sonally and seem equally knowledgeable about both. 
In 
cultural evolutionary terms the "piney" adaptation is of 
interest 
as 
a s=ort of reversion 
to 
the 
hunting-and-gathering 
phase of human history. 
In fact, the contrast between the heart 
of the Fine Barrens as habitat for pine coneys, moss pullers, and 
ho undsmen 
and 
the agricultural zones 
 
north, 
west, 
and 
so utt•7 
parallels the neolithic revolutionary watershed in human history. 
A 
few 
individuals 
in fact do make their living by 
pursuing 
ax 
seasonal round of extractive activities focused on native species 
of plants and animals. 
They depend on hard work., sharp wits, and 
a 
detailed 
understanding 
of 
their 
natural 
and 
social 
surroundings. 
However, these modern-day foragers rarely eat what 
they gather, 
but rather sell their harvests for cash. 
They arE.:r 
thus inextricably bound up in the volatile world 
economy. 
Note 
how 
Jack. 
Cervetto 
and 
Bill Wasiowich 
describe 
the 
changinr1 
fashions that have dictated their own choice of woods work. 
Wild 
huckleberries 
were once shipped out by the train 
load, 
but 
n1::1 
longer.  
The 
pine cone "industry" is threatened by 
competition 
from 
imported Italian canes! 
These shifting fashions replicate-:, 
on 
a small scale the rise and fall of Fine 
Barrens 
industries 
such as bog iron smelting. 
The 
management 
issue 
is directly 
relevant 
here, 
as 
t 
maintain 
the 
local 
folkways 
requires 
maintaining 
a 
dynamic_- 
balance of shifting forces, 
not a static image • 
•f conditions 
at 
one 
point 
in 
time. 
The adaptability of the local 
people 
is 
striking. 
Their responses to changing social as well as natural. 
environmental conditions is highly 
innovative.

Jack Cervetto collected and sold it 
as:> 
"sheet 
moss" to New York flovists for window dressing. 
Cut 
it 
out in G" x 6" squares with a trowel, 
roll it up like turf, them 
pack it in huckleberry crates to ship to New York City, 
or deli-
vered 
to a distributor in Tappan, 
New York. 
This 
distributor 
took three kinds of moss (sheet, 
lump, and sphagnum), as well as 
pine cones, 
oak leaves, 
and brush. 
(PFp84-AEHO05-pg.

Jack 
finds it 
in "oak bottom.'' 
Sp0gn_im spp. 
Sphagnum moss. 
Harvested from pine Barrens bogs 
for sale to distributors such as Allyn Manufacturing. 
Ultimately 
used 
by florist industry for packing the roots of shrubs, 
etc., 
for shipping. 
Eugene Vivian named a Mr. Corliss of Tuckerton as 
one 
of 
the best "mossers." 
His son, 
Shorty 
Corliss, 
can 
be-
reached at 296-2556. 
Jack. Cervetto is another good mosser, phone 
i 
is 598-4293. 
Vivian stresses the importance of human disturbance 
as 
a positive factor in bog ecology, 
especially the process 
of 
"turfing," i.e., the removal of vegetation down to the substrate, 
in 
preparing 
cranberry bogs or in harvesting moss to 
seal 
old 
charcoal 
furnaces. 
This creates an ideal environment for 
such 
rare plants as orchids, 
curly grass fern, 
pitcher 
plant, 
etc. 
Jack Cervetto Lsed to "pull moss"; 
one of the types of work 
always available in the woods. 
Jack says the market for moss hais 
declined 
but 
is still there. 
He refers to local bags 
as 
"all 
sphagnum." 
Jack remarks, 
"In a bog there's no rug prettier Ethan 
sphagnum 
moss] with its golden fringe around it." 
A bushel 
of 
moss wet weighs ca. 
200 lbs, 
but only 15 lbs. when dry. 
A bale 
of 
dry 
moss is 2 x 2 feet by 34 inches and weighs ca. 
32 
lbs. 
But 
it will be heavier on a humid day! 
The moss 
business 
was, 
biggest 1850-1950; "they hauled it out by the railroad car full." 
Used 
everywhere by florist in the shipping of plants because 
of 
its 
water retention capacity. 
Now often replaced by st yrof 
oam, 
which is easier to get. 
Many old-time moss pullers quit, went to 
work, 
e. g. , in defense industries. 
Moss "keeps cumin' back when 
you pull it because moss is not a plant, 
it's a fungus"! 
Take, 
about 
four years to come back. 
Jack noted how the 
"whip-poor-
will 
shoe" 
(Cygri2edium acaule ?) 
keeps 
pulled 
moss--stacked 
about 
the bases of cedars to dry--wet by holding water in 
their 
blossoms. 
Bill 
Wasiowich 
a currently active "moss puller." 
He 
had 
just "pulled" a pick-up truck load (= 50 bushels) the day 
before) 
our visit (i. e. , 10-08-83) so was taking the day off. 
Bill had 
just 
sold 150 bales of moss to the State Forest. 
They need 
it 
for shipping pines, 
spruce trees, 
etc. 
They paid $1/bushel, 5 
bushels to the bale. 
So he made $750 on that deal. 
That was hiss 
entire year's effort this past year, 
less than the more usual 500 
bale 
year. 
He 
prefers 
moss 
pulling 
to 
some 
other 
woods 
activities, 
such as cutting birch, 
because it provides a steady 
income. 
He can make $5-75/day. 
His maximum was 200 bushels (_- 
$250) in one day. 
Moss also 
 used in "grave blankets." 
 He uses a 
bushel 
bucket--a wash tub with a canvas strap wired to the tubs' 
handles, 
the same tub he uses for collecting pine 
cones. 
Also 
needed 
for moss pulling are a rake (his was apparently homemade, 
with a 5 foot wooden handle with 14 wooden peg tines each 
ca. 
2 
inches long), 
a wheelbarrow, 
a pitchfork, 
a pick-up truck, and 
some 
planks to lay a track to get the wheelbarrow into the 
bog. 
Moss pulling is not as popular with the "drunks and bums" as pine 
coning 
because 
it requires "more of a set up and a place 
 
where 
you can dry out the moss, and turn around is not as quick." 
Bill 
says 
you 
pick 
moss in the fall and it'll keep 
well 
over 
the 
winter, 
until 
May at least. 
He prefers pulling moss close 
to 
home where he know the local people, 
as at Chatsworth on Haines' 
property where he can pull moss without being hassled. 
He claims:> 
mass will grow back in 3-4 years if in full sunlight. 
In 
fact, 
he 
believes 
moss is particularly abundant following cutting 
of-
the cedar from a bog. 
(RFR83-FEH1009) 
He also suggested that moss pulling stimulates the growth of 
moss, 
thus 
he regrets that fewer people today are pulling 
moss 
than in the past. 
On Oct. 
10, 
1983, Bill showed us his ongoing 
moss pulling operation in a cedar bog dust off Rte. 532 (Waret own 
2 
road) 
2.7 
miles west 
of SR 72. 
This bog was 14.5 miles 
from 
Bill's 
house. 
Bill was working about 50 feet out into the 
bog 
from the road spur. 
He quickly unloaded his tools, put them into 
the wheelbarrow, 
and ran the wheelbarrow out his plank track 
tc, 
his working area in the bong. 
He worked rapidly and intently, as 
he intended to continue working until dark that day. 
Leo 
Landy 
uses 
a foot long 2 x 4 (in 
preference 
to 
the 
styrofoarii 
used in commercial operations) with sphagnum mass 
as 
backing to hold his grave pillows together. 
Jim 
Stasz explained on his Batsto Nature Center walks 
that 
sphagnum 
moss 
was of critical importance during World War I as 
sterile dressing. 
Large quantities were harvested and shipped to 
the European front.  
The moss has the ability to sterilize water 
strained through it. 
This antedated our modern understanding of 
sterilization 
techniques. 
It 
is listed 
in 
old-time 
materia 
medica publications.

in 
general. 
Leo 
Landy 
remarked 
of 
the 
Pinelands 
Commissioners, 
that most "couldn't tell the difference between a 
two-needle and the three-leaf pine." 
(PFP84-FEHOE19-pg. 
1) 
Pines echinata Mill. 
Short-leaved or two-needle 
pine. 
Called 
"two-leaved 
pine" (Freeman Taylor), 
"smooth-bark pine" (by 
Tom 
Brown), 
or dust "echinata" (by Leo Landy). 
Most readily distin-
guished 
from 
Pines 
rigida by smooth bark 
and 
straight 
trunk 
lacking 
limbs 
on lower trunks of larger 
trees 
(T. 
Brown, 
F. 
Taylor). 
Toni 
Brown says it is therefore better for lumber than 
"bull pine" (P_ 
rigida). 
Jack Cervetto of Warren Grove does not 
include it 
in his pine classification, 
perhaps because it is not 
frequently 
seen in his immediate vicinity. 
This pine 
is 
less 
successful 
after 
fire than P. 
rigida, 
and is absent from 
the 
Plains entirely, 
thus perhaps scarce in the Warren Grove region. 
Alternatively, 
Jack 
may 
include P. 
echinata with 
typical 
P. 
rigida as "upland pine," as he recognizes that such pines may 
be 
"two-leaf" 
or "three-leaf pines." 
Most abundant in an 
associa-
tion 
with scarlet oak (J. 
McCormick, 
in R. 
Forman, 
p. 
2?,9). 
Freeman Taylor burns it as firewood. 
He says that people 
claim 
pine will gum up your chimney, but he finds it works well if dry. 
Prefers 
"two-leaf 
pine" to "bull pine" for burning because 
it 
smells good, has light colored wood." 
Leo 
Landy used to sell pine seed: 
it was important not 
to 
mix 
"echinata" with "rigida." 
Got out of the pine seed business 
because 
a New York customer refused to pay for seeds he 
claimed 
did not germinate. 
He still feeds to the birds seeds obtained in 
the process of preparing pine cones for sale. 
Pines ponderosa 
Ponderosa pine. 
Tom Brown has one he planted in 
his woodlot. 
Pines rigida Mill. 
Pitch pine. 
Called "bull pine" by Tom Brown 
and 
distinguished 
from 
"smooth-bark" 
and 
"spruce" 
pines 
by 
roughbark, 
limby-ness, 
etc. 
It is normally too "limby" to 
be, 
much good for lumber, though ok for box boards, according to Torn. 
Differentiated into "bull pine"--a swamp ecotype with particular-
ly 
hard 
and 
durable wood--"pitch pine" or 
"upland 
pine"--the 
typical form, 
and "scrub" or "jack pine"--the dwarf P. 
rigida of 
the Plains--in Jack Cervetto's classification. 
The dwarfed popu-
lations 
of the Plains are thought to have resulted from 
natural 
selection 
for frequent, 
hot wild fires 
over 
centuries. 
Such 
trees 
have 
a much higher frequency of 
serotinous 
cones--i.e., 
opening only after a fire--produce cones at an earlier age and in 
greater 
quantity 
than standard P. 
rigida, 
and have a genetic 
tendency to be multi-stemmed. 
As Jack Cervetto notes, the "dwarf 
5 
pine" 
[of the plains] "are the ones that produces the most 
seed 
and that has the most pine cones on to it. 
The ether, the 'pitch 
pine,' they're so high that you couldn't reach 'em, 
where 
these 
Edwarf pines] , you just walk around and pick ' 
em. " Cervet t 
o has 
a tree in his front yard he grew from seed brought home inciden-
tally 
to collecting pine cones for sale which is 
tall--thus 
in 
Jack's 
view 
demonstrating the importance of 
soils--but 
multi-
stemmed. 
This 
dwarf growth form and tendency to produce 
abun--
dant, 
closed 
cones 
is 
the 
key to the 
development 
of 
"pine 
coning," collection of closed cones, 
forced open in hot 
houses, 
for 
sale 
in the decorative plant markets of 
the 
region. 
The 
Plains, 
of course, 
is the ideal setting for efficient cone col-
lection. 
Frill 
Wasiowich and Jack Cervetto collect or have col-
lected 
cones. 
Hazel and Leo Landy and A11yn's of Whiting 
cure 
and market the cones. 
P. 
rigidz also valuable once for 
lumber; 
now 
for 
pulp wood, 
as part of a major local industry 
(cf. 
P. 
Wacker and J. 
E. 
Applegate, S. 
Little, and P. 
E. 
Marucci, 
in R. 
Forman). 
Eugene 
Vivian 
relates 
a story 
about 
the 
old-time 
silviculturalist, 
Silas 
Little 
(now retired on 
Creek 
Rd. 
iri 
Moorestown, 
x:'35-3615), who hired some "pineys" to bring him some 
pine cones for propagation. 
Of course, they went straight to the 
pine 
plains--where 
the cones are easily 
reached. 
Thus 
Silas 
discovered 
the 
genetic distinctiveness of plains 
pine 
popula--
t 
i 
ons. 
Bill Wasiowich reports that Allyn's Manufacturing buys 
most 
of 
the 
pine cones collected in his area. 
He considers 
Warren 
Grove (the West plains) the best area for cones. 
The cones there 
are less "ragged"--i.e., 
larger, and less worm drilled--than the 
cones 
on the East plain, 
but it is easier to get around in 
the 
East 
Plains. 
Some 
places are too brushy. 
One 
needs 
to 
be 
careful 
not 
to get lest when back off the road, 
especially 
on 
cloudy 
days when there's no shadow to give direction. 
He 
also 
relies 
on 
wind direction on windy days to 
keep 
his 
bearings. 
Other 
possible collecting areas include Spring Hill where 
there 
had 
recently 
been a fire, 
and in the Forked 
River 
Mountains. 
Particularly 
productive 
are 
pulp wood operations 
(perhaps 
he 
gathers cones from the brush left after the wood is cut?). 
Bill 
asserts that "picking cones makes them come back. better. 
Without 
picking cones get ragged, 
that is, 
wormy and small. 
Most pine 
cone collecters pick on the Navy parachute drop target range 
(at 
Coyle 
Field?). 
He's heard that the state may purchase land and 
then prohibit pineconing there. 
He uses a bushel bucket--washtub 
with home-rigged shoulder strap--and a pair of old work gloves to 
pick cones. 
The cones are pitchy and prickly. 
Rain spoils this 
work 
as 
the gloves get wet. 
He gets 1.5 bushels to a 
bag 
of 
cones and can pick 10 bags/day and gets $5.00/bag ($50/day). 
He 
picks 
cones 
in the winter. 
Cane harvests are good year 
after 
year, 
but 
you 
have to knew the best 
spots. 
Where 
cones 
are 
thickest 
he can fill his bucket in half the time it would other-
wise take. 
He can tell if someone else has been picking cones in 
an area recently by the presence of broken stems at the edge of a 
stand 
of trees. 
He says he doesn't know what to call 
it 
where 
you're out picking cones, 
whether "pinebal 1 
ing" or "pineconing, " 
a distinction reported by Christine. 
(pFp83-FEH1009, FEH1011)

He 
demonstrated 
his technique at Coyle Airfield 
just 
off 
SR72 
) Oct. 
11, 
1983, 
in pines ca. 
E to 8 feet high 
(photos 
Czarnicki and Hunn). 
He takes cones open (rarely encountered) or 
closed, 
this 
year's and last year's. 
The older cones are gray 
where 
exposed but still brown against the 
branch. 
Third 
year 
cones 
are 
no good because they get full of worm holes and 
will 
thus fall apart when opened. 
Such cones are described as 
"long 
done," 
and expression Lill used to describe his late mentor Fred 
Brown of John McPhee fame. 
They are entirely gray. 
Buyers used 
to 
take only this year's cones but are less particular now 
that 
fewer people are pineconing. 
He figures that ca. 50 people were 
picking around Chatsworth a dozen years ago, though marry of these 
were 
just "drunks and burns" who' d pick just long enough 
to 
get 
money for another round of drink. 
He thinks they've moved up to 
around 
Brown's 
Mills now to do their picking as he doesn't 
see 
them much anymore. 
(PFP83-FEH1009, FEH1011) 
R_ 
rigida 
is 
an 
earlier successional species 
on 
upland 
sites, 
eventually replaced by oaks if not burned. 
J. 
Cervetto 
considers the presence of a dense, tall stand of "upland pine" iri 
a stretch of "oak bottom" a sure sign of previous human 
occupa-
tion 
in 
which 
the 
oaks 
had been 
pulled 
out 
by 
the 
roots 
(otherwise 
they would have grown back). 
Pines grow tallest 
on 
"oak 
bottom" soils. 
Such pine was pretty good for lumber, 
for-
house 
framing, 
but 
there's not enough of it in oak 
bottom 
to 
bother with. 
Pines growing on sandy soils of "pine bottom" 
are 
stunted, 
half 
way between the tallest pines and the dwarf pines 
of the plains. 
(PFP84-AEH014-pg. 
14) 
This is a sort of "seedious 
bottom" (from "deciduous") found on uplands. 
See R. 
E. 
Good, N. 
F. 
Good, and J. 
W. 
Andresen, 
in R. 
Forman. 
True "pine bottom" is 
usually "sand bottom." 
Jack Cervetto 
notes that pine knots--which remain after the 
rest 
of the tree has rotted away--were a source of 
pitch. 
The 
knots were used as candles, 
but they filled the house with pitch 
smoke.

use 
for this put-pose first split the knot into 
E-7 
strips, 
then tie there together. 
Knots burn so hot they may warp 
a stove. 
To extract pitch from knots build a 10 x 10 x 10 
foot 
cube of knots over a sand and clay 
 floor.  
Cover as in a chat-coal 
kiln, 
burn. 
You will get 10-15 barrels of pine knot pitch. 
The 
pitch 
was 
used to grease wagon wheels and to grease 
shafts 
of 
machinery 
in 
mills. 
Pine 
knots were also used to 
hold 
saws 
straight in lumber- mills. 
(PFP84-FEH03`1-pg. 3) 
Otherwise pine 
is good only for pulp wood. 
On "pine coning": 
Cones grow each 
year. 
A new cone is brown, 
which are preferred to 
the 
dark, 
older 
cones 
of previous years. 
Such a "black cone" 
might 
be? 
taken but it would have to be painted. 
The "Jersey cone" "is the 
hardest cone in the world; when it opens up it looks exactly like 
a rose." 
A 
1 
1 
yn' s now pays $4.50 to 
$5.00/1000. 
"A 
thousand 
cones is more than a bushel, 
more like two bushels. 
Depends on 
the 
size." 
PFP84-AEH005-pg. 
11) 
No one in Warren Grove picks 
cones anymore, but there are still a few people from Chatsworth R 
West Creek that do. 
In the old days he got just $0.50/1000; they 
could pick 10-1,000/day (1000 /hour), 
to earn a better day's pay 
than "if you woked for anybody." 
Cervetto notes that one 
should 
wait till after the first frost to pick pine cones, 
as then they 
just 
snap 
off 
without damaging the tree. 
He is 
critical 
of 
7 
pickers 
who pick at other seasons, 
as that lets the sap out 
of 
the tree so it won't produce cones for five years of so. 
(PFP84-
AEHO14-pg.

Pine needles purchased in the fall to make "grave 
blankets." 
(PFP84-AEH005-pg. 7) 
Leo and Hazel Landy buy pitch pine cones for processing 
and 
sale. 
Leo 
forces then, open in both a heating shed--fired by 
a 
stove that burns wood scraps--and a greenhouse--using solar heat. 
The 
latter 
is a recent innovation and produces a paler 
colored 
finished cone. 
The heating shed gets to ca. 
150 degrees F.; the 
greenhouse--which 
is ca 30 feet long by a 7 foot 
diameter 
arch 
covered 
with plastic--to ca. 
120+ (early 
October, 
afternoon). 
Curing cones must be turned regularly; with those that open first 
set 
aside. 
Leo 
buys 
cones from collectors 
for 
$7/1000 
(or 
bushel, 
as 
measured by a special basket he 
keeps); 
sells 
the. 
processed cones for $20/1000, 
in lots of 500, which equal about 13 
lbs., @ ca. 
$10. 
Leo instructs collectors ("Pineys") to bring in 
new cones, not "those old enough to vote." 
(PFP83-FEH1008-pg. 4, 
FEH 1220-pg . 3 
) 
Lou 
Golin of Allyn's Manufacturing, 
Whiting, 
NJ, 
reports 
that 
his company sold 6-7 million cones/year during the 
1970's, 
but 
now down to a few hundred thousand/year. 
He verifies 
that 
they do compete with cones imported from Italy (stone 
pine?:EH). 
After 
characterizing 
"pineys" as economically 
irrational 
(pay 
them 
more 
and 
they 
just bring in 
less--responding 
to 
fixed 
desires), 
he then noted (unaware of the contradiction) that Frill 
Wasiowich 
had 
not 
been bringing in 
cones 
when 
they 
offered 
$6/1000, 
but 
when they raised the ante to $7/1000 Bill 
started 
bringing 
in 25,000 a week! 
He told stories of "Pineys" such as 
Jack Richardson's mother,, who was still packing 30-40 lg. 
sacks 
of cones out of the woods at age of 90 +. 
Allen Bolin, 
the son, 
gave me a tour of their plant. 
The cure cones in a curing 
shed 
with 
two heaters and a fan, 
bringing the temperature to 135-140 
degrees F. 
They used to use a grader to sort sizes but no longer 
find it worth the effort. 
Tom 
Brown 
cut all the pine (presumably mostly pitch 
pine) 
from 
his property, 
"And then the pine don't come back--the 
oak. 
comes back." 
He has just one pine tree left (actually a Ponder-
osa 
pine he planted!). 
Torn recognizes "bull pine," aka "Jersey 
pine" 
CPinus r^igida:EH) which contrasts with "smooth-bark 
pine" 
CPinus 
echinata7:EH) 
which 
"goes up straight 
with 
no 
limbs; 
they're much better for lumber." 
(PFP83-AEH003-pg. 
15) 
Freeman 
Taylor 
calls this species "bull pine" (except 
for , 
those 
in 
the Plains, 
called "scrub pine") from 
the 
"two-leaf 
pine" by its rough bark, crooked trunk, darker wood. 
Jack 
Cervetto notes that "pitch pine'll burn anytime it can 
get started," but survives fire, 
unlike the oak which is 
killed 
by 
fire because "oak sap is right under the bark." 
Jack recalls 
that 
as 
a young man he left Warren Grove 
for 
a time 
(after-
spending most of his childhood here), 
but came back at age of 21 
because he "kept smelling the pine pitch and had to come back!" 
Jo Ann van Istendal notes how 20 year, old pitch pine on 
her 
property has grown back stunted by crowding. 
She favors creative 
disturbance, 
clearing 
trees 
to 
make 
adequate 
room 
for 
the 
remainder to grow. 
8 
Pinus 
strobes L. 
Eastern white pine. 
Not native to the 
Pine 
Barrens, 
but a valued ornamental planting (of. 
NR). 
Grown for 
pulp wood on properties designated tree farms for tax incentives, 
as at J. 
A. 
van I 
st enda l' s in Marlton. 
See MH, 
EH. 
Freeman 
Taylor 
has one in his yard; 
the seedling snagged on his bumper, 
so he planted it, 
10-1c years ago. 
Good for firewood; used to be 
lots 
near Taylor's place as there was a CCC camp where many 
had 
been 
planted. 
The camp burned in 1963; 
killed all 
the 
white 
pines.

Jo Ann 
van 
Istendal recounted haw they have been "encouraged" to 
plant 
white 
pine in neat rows as a "tree farm" under the direction 
of 
State foresters in order to claim farmland exemptions. 
She 
and 
her 
father find such artificial order offensive and hide it from 
view of their house! 
Pinus taeda L. 
Loblolly pine. 
Not native to the Pinelands but 
introduced by S. 
Little, 
especially in the hybrid P. 
taeda X P. 
r_igida, 
as 
a promising timber tree combining the 
high 
growth 
potential of P. 
taeda with the cold tolerance of P. 
rigida. 
Such 
a hybrid is successfully grown in Korea for reforestation (see F. 
T. 
Led i 
g and S. Little, 
in R. 
Forman, pg . 367) . 
Jim 
Stasz 
does not find the loblolly pine forests 
to 
the 
south to be as distinctive and interesting as the New Jersey Pine 
Barrens. 
Pinus virginiana Mill. 
Scrub pine. 
Called "spruce pine" by Tom 
Brown, 
Millville. 
Wood 
is good for lumber if you can 
find 
a 
large 
tree that is not "limby," a characteristic of the species. 
An uncommon pine in the Pinelands, 
typical of "old field" situa-
tions, 
in 
succession. 
Jim 
Stasz notes that this 
species 
is, 
characteristic 
of 
a narrow strip of land 
along 
the 
Delaware 
River 
in 
the 
"coastal 
plain zone" (as 
opposed 
to 
the 
Pine 
Barrens), 
and 
that Saw-whet Owls show a distinct preference for 
such stands. 
Pinus sylvestris 
Scotch pine. 
Torn Brown's neighbor has planted this 
for sale as Christmas trees; people come to cut their own. 
Italian stone pine? 
Potential competitor to "Jersey cone." 
CUPRESSACEAE: 
Chamaecygaris 
thyoides (L). 
Atlantic 
white 
cedar. 
EH#1534. 
Characteristic tree of Pine Barrens bogs. 
Local populations are 
known 
as 
"Jersey cedar" or "swamp cedar" (the latter terra 
con-
trasting with "upland cedar," Juniperus virginiana) and the basis 
of an industry pre-dating European settlement. 
(As a book can and 
will be written on this tree, 
I will leave it at this for 
now.) 
JL, MH, EH, 
etc. 
Jim 
Stasz 
lists wood thrush and hooded 
warbler 
as 
birds 
typical 
of stream bottom habitats dorainated by white cedar. 
No 
prothonotary warblers in cedar swamps, 
but rather in the sharply 
contrasting Southern hardwood swarap habitats found on the margins 
of 
the 
Pine 
Barren 
zone. 
White 
cedar 
provides 
nesting 
9 
opportunities (beneath shaggy bark) for brown creeper, 
a species 
more 
typical of montane hemlock (Tsuga) 
forests. 
The 
coastal 
race 
of black-throated green warbler (Wayne's) also found 
here; 
another 
example 
of 
a more typically montance 
species 
with 
a 
disjunct 
distribution in white cedar swamps. 
(RFp83- AEHO05-pg.

) 
Jack 
Cervetto says cedar is cut at any 
season; 
it's 
year 
round woods work. 
He used to collect cedar brush for sale also. 
Just 
go 
in 
where 
someone was cutting cedar and 
pick 
up 
the 
branches. 
One 
could make a good day's wage that 
way. 
Before 
plywood, 
"every 
boat was made out of cedar.... 
I cut an awful 
lot of cedar for boats." 
PFR84-AEHO14-pg. 2) 
Crooked cedar logs 
were 
used 
for 
"dead men," anchors 
to 
hold 
bulkheads. 
Jack 
criticizes 
use of "brassy" cedar, 
i 
. 
e. , cedar just 
cording 
up 
green with lots of low branches (maybe 40-50 years old), 
instead 
of mature, 
100 year old cedar. 
Mature cedar, or "old cedar," has 
more "heart" than "sap." "the heart, 
this red 
part,... 
this'll 
never rot, 
in water or in the ground. 
This white part [the sap] 
will 
crumble 
right up and rot." 
(ibid., 
pg. 
3) 
Jack 
can 
distinguish 
cedars with rotten cores by the somewhat twisted way 
they grow. 
The best are ca. 
100 years old and have a tall clean 
bole, 
10 
to 12 inches in diameter, 
without branches (and 
thus 
knots), 
from growing in the thick center of the 
swamp. 
Poorer 
trees 
growing 
along the sloughs (pronounced 
"sl-ow-s", 
as 
iri 
"how") have too many branches, are knotty. 
However, 
if left they 
facilitat 
reseeding after cutting since they produce many seeds. 
His cedar swamps have been cut three times, 
first in 
ca. 
1745, 
then in the mid -1800, 
and now. 
He will cut ca. 
100 bean poles 
(for 
"pole beans," i.e., 
limas) this week for a farmer "down in 
South 
Jersey." 
the reputation of his cedar is passed to 
custo-
mers 
by word of mouth. 
He cut 25 28 foot marina 
pilings 
last 
week for a marina in Waretown. 
He also cuts clam stakes, 
which 
are 2 inches by 16-18 feet, 
and channel markers, 
3 inches by 25 
feet. 
The 
channel markers are longer because the channels 
are 
deeper 
than the clam beds. 
He cuts cedar also for 
bird 
house 
poles, 
flag 
 
poles, 
lumber and shakes for his own use, 
and for•, 
pilings, 
decks, 
walks, stringers and docks, especially in shore 
areas. 
He uses 1 x 3 or, 1 x 4 inch planks for tread on walks and 
decks.Of the upland-cedar swamp boundary, 
"you can almost 
slice 
it. if 
Freeman Taylor's father ran a sawmill, cutting mostly cedar. 
"Though 
he never had no education, 
he could tell just how 
many 
feet 
of 
lumber in a tree. 
He was smart that way." 
Tom 
Brown 
cites white cedar as good kindling, 
split, 
as it's light. 
Bill. 
Wasiowich cuts some cedar poles, 
ca. 
5-6 feet long. 
He debarks 
there on a homemade tool, an eight foot plank on short legs with at 
wood frame wedged in place over a smaller plank to hold the 
pole 
to be debarked. 
He distinguishes white from red cedar, and white 
from red oak, though the latter is not found locally, he notes. 
Allyn's Manufacturing market cedar slabs, 
eighth round with 
bark. 
Jo Ann van Istendal believes in management of "wild" 
areas, 
noting 
that cedar cutting, 
bog iron operations, 
and 
cranberry 
cultivation constitute a natural, managed sequence.

Eastern red cedar. 
Locally known 
as 
"upland

Chamaecypar_is 
thyoides, 
a species marginal to the Rine Barrens, rather charac-
teristic 
of the border, zone of the coastal and 
Delaware 
Valley 
margins of the Rine Barrens. 
Tom Brown keeps his traps, 
ready to set for fox, 
in "cedar

because 
the 
cedar 
(not white cedar but "red

In winter 
its 
ghostly white bark shines through the woods. 
Branches and some-
times the whole tree cut for decorative purposes. 
Birch branches 
and birch logs are sold by roadside floral stands and marketed by 
Allyn 
Manufacturing 
Co. 
Eugene 
Vivian 
believes 
that 
the 
collecting of birch twigs does not harm the birch population, 
as 
they 
readily 
regenerate lost twigs. 
Jack 
Cervetto 
calls 
it 
simply "birch." 
He cut all his off ?0 to 30 years ago when there 
was 
a 
good market for it, 
for decorative logs, 
table 
pieces. 
"Now it's all coming back, but it's small." 
(PFP84-AEHO14-pg. 5) 
Tore Brawn pointed out a dead birch in his yard he called a "white 
birch," may be this species. 
He cited no use for birch. 
Bill 
Wasiowich says that 20-30 people are now in the 
birch 
cutting 
business, 
mostly around Brown's Mills, 
usual ly 
"burns, 
drunks." 
It 
is sold for decorative uses. 
He doesn't cut birch 
because it doesn't pay as you spend too much time looking for- it. 
He 
has heard the claim that one can make up to $150/day 
cutting 
birch but he's not sure he believes it. 
At

They also tied birch twigs to form 
swan figures. 
Wayne Pittman collects birch for them. 
FAGACEAE 
Fsgms grandifolia Ehrh. 
Beech. 
Absent from the Pinelands. 
its 
presence along streams draining into the Delaware River help mark 
the 
southeastern 
boundary 
of the Pine Barrens region 
for 
Jirrs 
Stasz. 
Such trees are striking in 
winter; 
huge, 
symmetrical, 
pale barked. 
Quercus. 
Oak. 
The characteristic mix of a variety of oaks with 
pitch 
pine 
(Pines 
rigida) defines the "pine barrens" 
for 
Jim 
Stasz. 
Eight 
species are widespread in the core 
pine 
barrens 
area, while several additional species are more or less common or, 
12 
the margins. 
Oak used primarily for fire wood according to Jack. 
Cervetto. Tom Brown also uses mostly oak for firewood. 
He notes, 
"We 
burn 
wood all winter long. 
We've always done 
it. 
We've 
never 
had 
nothin' 
but wood 
heat" 
(RFP83-AEHO02-pg. 
3) . Tom 
contrasts the hardwoods such as oak and hickory (Carya sp.) 
with 
pine as firewood: 
pine is fast burning, but it must be split and 
seasoned 
or 
it gets waterlogged and worms get under 
the 
bark. 
Hardwoods 
are 
"long 
lasting." 
Oak not 
so 
good 
for 
timber, 
according 
to Tom, 
because by the time it gets large enough 
its 
riddled 
by ants and termites. 
He prefers oak to maple 
because 
maple 
burns too fast and throws off sparks. 
Tom says it's 
not 
hard to get oak, started if it's well seasoned. 
He "racks up" his 
firewood 
supply 
in the basement where he can feed 
it 
directly 
into 
the firebox of his heater. 
Tom's property is almost 
pure..., 
oak now, though used to have pine mixed in. 
When pines cut, only 
oaks 
grew 
back. 
Torn 
pointed out "white 
oak," 
"black 
oak, " 
"chestnut 
oak," 
and "pin oak" [probably scarlet oak:EH7 in 
his 
wood 1 
of , and c 
1 
a 
i 
rned to have also 
 
turkey" and "red oaks. " 
Freeman Taylor distinguishes "white," "black," and "chestnut 
oak" by their bark (see below). 
Says all are good for firewood, 
though chestnut oak perhaps best. 
Jack 
Cervetto's habitat classification system includes "oak 
bottom," characterized by near absence of pine. 
This is charac-
teristic 
about 
Warren Grove. 
An area of pine 
in 
oak 
b 
ot t 
orn 
indicates 
an 
old settlement where the oaks were cut and 
stumps 
pulled in clearing the land, 
thus giving the pine an opportunity 
to grow. 
(Note seerning contradiction in local succession with Toni 
Brown's 
experience.) 
Oak bottorn has relatively rich soil 
(cf. 
PFP84-AEHO 14-pp. 
1-3) , while 
"pine 
bot t 
orn" 
is usually 
sandy. 
Cervetto also used to collect oak leaves commercially, sold to an 
outfit at Tappan, New York. 
He now sells firewood cutting rights:> 
on 
his property. 
A couple of young men from Barnegat were cut-
ting for sale Mar. 
18, 
1984 (see PFp84-AEHO05-pg. 
12; FEH0318-pg. 
3). 
They 
were cutting white or chestnut oak, 
loading 12 
inch 
diameter lags into the back of their pick-up trucks. 
One roan cut 
the logs to thength of his pick-up bed for later custom 
cutting. 
Jack 
sells cutting rights on his land for, $30/cord; 
a ready cut 
and cured (a year needed to cure pr=operly) cord of fireplace wood 
may 
sell for $100-120/cord, 
smaller "stove wood" (6 inch d 
i 
arne-•• 
ter, 
ca. 
16 inch lengths) for $90. 
A pick - Up truck lead is ca. 
half a cord. 
Thus Jack was quite concerned when the (apparently 
county 
inspectors) 
shut hire down for 
alleged 
violations 
just 
before 
last Christmas, 
depriving the wood cutters from

their Christmas sales. 
Someone had reported that woodcutters on 
his land had left branches, 
etc. 
Jack noted that that wood had 
not 
been "left to rot" but was to be cleaned up by "stove 
wood" 
cutters. 
He also needed to flag a 30 foot roadside buffer. 
He 
complained that "the inspectors may know the woods but they don' t 
know 
the 
business," 
and that the closure didn't hurt 
hire 
but 
certainly hurt the young woodcutters.

Quercus alba L. 
White oak. 
EH#1502. 
Characteristic blue-green 
matte-surfaced 
leaves 
and smooth whitish bark. 
Local name 
is 
"white 
oak," with bark an important 
identifying 
feature. 
Torn 
Brown 
cites 
its use in the manufacture of split white oak 
bas-
kets, 
an tradition of his Indian grandfather. 
Wood also favored 
for axe handles (PFP83-AEHO03-pg. 
2). 
Jack Cervetto says there 
is 
demand for white oak for lumber, 
but only if the 
trees 
are 
over, 
12-14 inches in diameter. 
Freeman Taylor identifies 
this 
species 
(in 
comparison with "black oak" and "chestnut oak") 
by 
its smooth, 
pale bark, as does Cervetto. 
His father said it was 
good for axe handles, 
"You can't break it; 
spring it double, 
it 
won' t break. " Torn Brown notes that "white oak." is 
the 
species 
hardest 
hit 
by gypsy moth. 
Cervetto reports that he was 
con-
scripted to collect bushels of "pin" and "white oak" acorns by 
a 
nursery one time, 
but that they were so scattered he gave it up. 
Bill Wasiowich, like Jack Cervetto, calls post oak "white oak." 
Quercus coccinea Muenchh. 
EH#1506, 
15`9, 
1681. 
Scarlet oak. 
Similar to Q. 
velutina. 
May be known locally as "pin oak" (e.g., 
Jack 
Cervetto) 
a species apparently absent from 
the 
Pineland 
core. 
Cervetto reports that he was conscripted to collect bushels 
of 
"pin" and "white oak" acorns by a nursery one time, 
but that they 
were so scattered he gave it up. 
Torn Boown called it "red oak," 
said that it was hard to tell from "black =yak." 
Quercus falcata Michx. 
Spanish oak. 
Common on the margins as at 
Corbin City, 
etc. 
Torn Brown called it "pin oak." 
Quercus i

Scrub oak. 
Corn--
Mon 
species, 
often with Q_ 
rnarilandica. 
Both may 
be 
called 
"scrub 
oak" locally, 
though this species is singled taut as 
the 
primary food of white-tailed deer Jack Cervetto says of it, 
"they 
[scrub 
oaks] produce a lot of acorns--in spats, 
riot everywhere. 
That's 
the 
acorn that's half the size of the 
tree 
acorn, 
and 
smaller animals feed on that. 
Specially grouse and quail 
(cf., 
RFP84-AEHO14-pg. 7). 
Jack scouts out productive clusters of this 
"scrub 
oak" before hunting season. 
"Where you find your 
acorn 
crop, 
that's 
where 
the deer are. 
That's their main 
food 
iri 
winter time. 
The scrub oak acorn ... on the plains. 
You'll find 
scrub 
oak--and it doesn't grow all over. 
It's 
amazing, 
those 
acorns, 
you'll 
only find there in spots. 
You'll find maybe 
an 
acre 
or 
two of scurb oaks here full of acorns. 
And you 
go 
at 
couple 
or 
three hundred yards away and those scrub 
oaks 
won't 
have 
any. 
But if you can find those acorn spots.... 
The only 
way 
you can tell is to just follow the road until you see 
where 
the deer tracks are, 
where they're heading, then you find them." 
(PFp84-AEHO05-pg . 
10 ) 
Toni 
Brown corroborates this noting that the "scrub oak gets 
loaded. 
The scrub oak is what grows in poor ground, 
and that'-- 
loaded 
with little tiny acorns.... 
1deer] stand up and 
they'll 
cut the branches off, just snip 'ern right off. 
When they fall to 
the ground then they'll eat at their leisure." 
(PFP84-AEHO09-pg.

This is the prototypical "scrub oak" for Tom based on 
his 
description.

Abundant 
scrub oak of the 
Fine Plains and 
Fine

May be known locally as "blackjack oak" (e.g., Jack. 
Cervetto) 
or simply as "scrub oak," not differentiated 
from 
Q. 
i1icifolis (B. 
Wasiowich, Tom Brown). 
Jack was trying to recall 
the 
name of this species, 
which he distinguished from the 
true 
"scrub 
oak," by virtue of its growing in the plains 
and 
having 
"round 
balls 
about 
the size of a plum Ewith7 
a 
little

Dwarf oak. 
Fairly common and

Occurs around Bill Wasiowich's house. Thought by Tom Brown 
to be a young "chestnut oak.." 
Quercus prinus L. 
Chestnut oak. 
EH#15219. 
Common species. 
Lo-
cally 
identified primarily by deeply furrowed bark. 
Apparently 
unique in its response to fire, resprouting in a "ring" about the 
old 
stump. 
Story in John McPhee's The Fine Barrens 
(pg. 
118) 
about "jailhouse trees" builds on this peculiarity. 
Joanne 
van 
Istendal 
uses 
such chestnut oak rings as planter boxes and 
wa-
tering 
troughs for her pets. 
Jack Cervetto calls this 
species 
"turkey

firewood. 
Freeman 
Taylor cites its distinctive heavy bark ridges, as does Cervetto. 
"Chestnut

Fairly common

(St one,

Torn Brown warned me not 
to touch an example of this. 
He called it "swamp poison

Stone notes that, 
"The vandalism of the Christmas 
peddlers, mainly negroes, 
is largely responsible for the dwarfed, 
barren 
condition of most of the hollies of West Jersey, 
but the 
importation 
of vast quantities of Holly and Mistletoe 
from 
the:., 
south 
to Philadelphia has largely done away with this, 
as it is 
easier for venders to secure a supply from the wholesalers on the:+

The only

to the pinelands. 
A characteristic small tree of swamps. 
Jack 
Cervetto 
defines swampy "sidious bottom" in terms of swamp maple-
crowding out white cedar following human disturbance. 
He distin-
guishes "swamp" and "upland" maples, 
the former he considers the 
best, 
the hottest firewood. 
Jack says, 
"If it's green, 
it'll 
take just as long as oak to burn up. 
But if it's dry, 
it'll burn 
a 
little 
 faster, 
but it gives you more heat 
[than 
oak7. 
And 
especially in a fireplace, 
it gives you a better glow, 
a better, 
color. 
Something 
in 
it 
gives 
you a nicer 
lookin' 
flame.'' 
(PFP84-AEHO14-pg. 5) 
Tom Brown, however, prefers oak to maple as 
"a lotta this here maple, 
it'll burn, 
but it burs so fast, soft, 
you knew. 
And there's a lotto snappin' and crackin' to it. 
If 
you goat a fireplace in there, 
you're gonna have sparks aflyin'." 
(PFP84-AEHO09-pg.

Tom says that some trappers use maple bark 
for dyeing traps, 
"toy darken ' 
em up" (PFP83-AEHO03-pg.

Jack 
Cervetto 
says there's no maple large enough for lumber 
in

Bill Lee considers maple too soft for Tyke frames. 
Jo Ann 
van Istendal notes how "swamp maple" has gr=own up in a thicket o-

i.. e. , culling 
to

The too 
dense,

Tom Brown says that foxes eat fruit, 
including wild 
grapes; 
here 
he distinguishes between "fox grapes" and "chicken grapes,'' 
apparently on the basis of size (of fruit).

the 
"chicken" versus "fox" distinction. 
considers 
 "fox

equivalent to his term "baby grape."

Kalrnia latifolia L. 
Mountain laurel. 
EH#1549?,

Known 
locally 
as "laurel." 
Common evergreen shrub or small understory 
tree in pine Barrens. 
Flowers May-July. 
Torn Brown pointed this 
out in his woodlot, 
called it "laurel," noting that in "Virginia 
the call it 'ivy.' 
I don't know how they ever get that.... " 
Torri 
reports that people gather laurel in the fall and that a 
machine 
makes laurel ropes for the decorator stores. 
The machine "ropes 
it 
and ties it." 
Laurel stalks collected and sold to one outfit 
28 
(J. 
Cervetto). 
Cervetto reports that, "people get the greens and 
then they get the flowers. 
But the flower period is short, 
and 
they get it when it's in bud. 
By the time they get to use it, 
it 
opens up." 
(PFP84-AEHO14-pg.

Used as decorative 
planting, 
as 
in CC carnp constructed during the depression at Lake 
Oswego. 
Cervetto 
says 
that the prettiest laurel "is down there 
in 
they 
plains, 
down 
in the jack pine area." 
He also notes that laurel 
is 
"a human enemy, " i

interview 
with 
Phil 
Marucci 
of 
Rutgers 
Cranberry 
ResearcF-r 
Center): 
Gaylussacia 
named for French scientist 
M. 
Gaylussac; 
distinguished 
by 
botanists 
and 
educated 
laypersons 
as 
"huckleberries" 
in 
contradistinction 
to 
Vaccinium, 
called 
"blueberries" 
(also including cranberries). 
Gaylussacias 
have 
ca 
10 
large 
seeds, 
vacciniums 
have 
20-45 
small 
seeds. 
Gaylussacia 
fruits are in loose strands while 
vaccinium 
fruits, 
29 
(of 
local 
species) 
are 
more 
clustered. 
Gaylussacias 
bloom 
later, 
by 
and 
large, 
here 
from 
20 
April 
through 
May. 
Gaylussacias 
are preferred hosts for one pest, 
the 
larval 
fly 
Rhagoletes 
mendax), 
though it will parasitize vacciniums 
also. 
For these reasons vacciniums preferred for human consumption. 
In 
local 
terms 
all gaylussacias and vacciniums (except 
cranberry) 
are 
huckleberries. 
Brad 
Thompson 
notes 
that 
his 
father 
calls 
even 
his 
cultivated 
"blueberries" 
"huckleberries"; 
they're 
all. 
"huckleberries." 
brad, 
however, 
has learned to distinguish the 
few, 
large 
seeded 
species as "huckleberries" 
from 
the 
small 
seeded 
"blueberries." 
Tam brown seems to use 
"huckleberry" 
and 
"blueberry" in broadly overlapping senses. 
While he 
growsi 
"cultivated 
blueberries," he says the best tasting is the "small 
huckleberry" 
[presumably Vaccinium vacillaris:EH]. 
"What 
makers 
your best huckleberry or blueberry, 
upland, 
is fire. 
The firer 
gees 
through 
and then after that the berries really 
come 
on." 
(PFP83-AEH04-pg . 8 
) 
Jack 
Cervetto 
comments as follows: 
"There's 18 
different 
varieties 
of 
huckleberries according to Hershberger^ 
[sic.].... 
There's big blues, 
small blues, 
big blacks, small blacks, medium 
blacks, 
medium blues; there's bilberry, there's grouseberry, the. 
upland blue, 
there's..." (PFP84-AEHO05-pg. 
3) 
He describes how 
wild huckleberries were harvested commercially in the early days. 
Huckleberry 
crates 
would 
be 
shipped out on 
the 
railroad 
to 
Barnegat by the market; 
3` quart crates at first. 
Then reduced 
to `4 quart. 
"Had three tiers into them. 
Then you'd go dawn to 
the 
railroad 
station and help yourself to whatever 
crates 
you 
needed. 
You went huckleberrying; 
filled your crates up. 
They 
send 
you 
the tags and everything. 
You put [the tags] 
on 
the 
crates 
and send them up to the market and wait for 
your 
check" 
(pg. 
9). 
They 
took 
all 
kinds of 
huckleberries, 
the 
price 
governed by the berry. 
Jack's classification scheme is described 
below, species by species. 
Bill 
Wasiowich gathers "wild huckleberries." 
He 
collects 
them 
in 
ca. 
20 pound shipping cans. 
Three years ago 
he 
got 
$8/can. 
He hasn't done much of that since. 
He collects in big 
swampy 
areas as frost is inhibited there. 
Presently (OCt. 
11, 
1983) 
there aren't many worth picking due to 
frost, 
just 
some 
"swamp huckleberries" (most likely Vaccinium corymbosum:EH). 
The 
price 
is the same as for commercial blueberries; 
they are 
used 
mostly for juice; 
sold for $1.00 /pint in stores this year. 
Bill 
"lost 
his 
appetite for" blueberries after seeing 
the 
spraying 
that is done (observed while working in blueberry fields). 
"Wild 
hocks" 
are selected by some people to avoid spray, 
he believes. 
One 
variety 
of "wild hock" is the "pillberry" 
(or 
"bilberry?, 
Gaylussacia 
frondosa:EH). 
It 
is real sweet but 
has 
lots 
of 
seeds; 
it grows in the woods. 
Bill says that "a goad man who's 
willing 
to 
work 
can 
make 
a good hundred 
dollars 
a day 
iri 
blueberry and wild huckleberry season." 
Gaylussacia 
baccata 
(Wang.) 
K. 
Koch. 
Black 
huckleberry. 
EH#1654. 
Aka "hag huckleberry." 
This is perhaps the most abun-
dant plant in the Fine Barrens. 
Phil Marucci suggests that 
the 
Pine 
Barrens might more accurately have been named the 
"huckle-
30 
berry 
barrens" after this species. 
It forces a shin-high ground 
cover 
beneath 
the oak-pine woodland 
over 
large 
areas. 
Jack. 
Cervetto calls this species the "upland black huckleberry," which 
may 
be the same type he says, 
"has black berries, 
real 
small; 
real, 
real 
sma11. 
And the whale bush'll be loaded with 
them. 
But 
they'd 
be so small that no one even bothers with 
them...." 
(PFP84-AEH005-pg. 
3) 
Jack notes that this species 
predominates 
over 
Vaccinium 
vaccilans in "pine bottom," vice versa 
in 
"oak 
bottom. " 
Torn 
Brown calls them " 
h 
o 
g 
I 
s huckleberry. " "You 
cook 
there and feed 'ern t• 
• the hogs... big seed and they get wormy."

It 
is rather uncommon, 
restric-
ted to bogs and other damp areas. 
They are the latest to flower-
(some still E0 June 1984). 
Jack Cervetto describes how he 
used 
to 
harvest there with scoops made of cedar siding, 
an example of 
which 
he showed me in his shed (PFP84-AEHO05-pg.

now

Tall 
huckleberry 
or 
dangleberry. 
EH#1653, 
1673. 
Locally known as "dangle " or "bil-
berry." 
Jack 
Cervetto notes, 
"These things are what 
we 
call 
danglers, 
or bilberries. 
They grit big seeds in 'em. 
They got a 
taste of their own. 
They're the last berry to ripen." 
(PFP84-•-
AEHO 15-pg . B) 
Almost 
 as late 
 to flower 
 as G. d 
umosa ; flowers 
 and 
fruits in long dangling clusters, 
thus the name. 
A tall shrub, 
common 
in 
understory of oak woodland. 
Attacked by gypsy 
moth 
larvae. 
Bill Wasiowich distinguishes one variety of "wild hock" 
as "pillberry" (or "bilberry?, 
Gaylussacia frondosa:EH). 
It is 
real sweet but has lots of seeds; 
it grows in the 
woods. 
Bill 
Wasiowich 
c=ollects 
the 
fruit 
of 
"sugar 
huck"

vacillans:EH). 
They grow about 1.5 to ` feet high. 
Pick there iri 
July, 
first or second week, 
through August, sometimes into Sep-
tember. 
"They 
have to be dead right or they're not worth 
any--
thing," says Bill. 
Freeman Taylor picks and eats the fruit of a 
tall, 
swamp plant with largish seeds he calls "bilberry," likely 
this species. 
Vaccinium 
atrococcum (Gray) Heller. 
Black highbush 
blueberry. 
EH#1650. 
Jack 
Cervetto calls it 
(apparently) "swamp black huc-
kleberry." 
He says it is not as good as the "swamp 
blues," 
good only for pies. 
He distinguishes small, 
medium, 
and large 
"blacks." 
This appears to be the fastest maturing species. 
Vaccinium 
caesariense 
Mackenz. 
Coastal 
highbush 
blueberry. 
EH#1659?, 
1663. 
Very similar to V. 
corymbosum and widely distri-
buted 
with it. 
Apparently not distinguished by locals, 
nor by 
Jim Stasz. 
Rather, 
Jack Cervetto for instance, locals may dis-
tinguish 
size variants within the "swamp blue huckleberry" 
com-
plex (inclusive of V. 
corymbosum and this species). 
Vaccinium 
corymbosum 
L. 
Common

The probable source of most or 
all 
domesticated varieties (P. 
Marucci suggests that V. 
angustifoliuni 
31 
Ait. 
also 
contributed, 
but that species does not appear to 
be 
indigenous 
to the Pinelands). 
Jack Cervetto lables this and V. 
Caesariense 
collectively as "swamp blue huckleberries" 
or 
Just 
"swarnp blues" 
 (in contrast to "upland 
 blues, " i 
. 
e. , V. 
vac i 
1 
1 
ans, 
"swarnp blacks, " i.e. , V. 
atrococcurn, and "upland blacks," i. e. , 
G. 
baccata). 
He distinguishes small, medium, and large "blues." 
Torn Brown calls the V. 
corymbosurn/caesariense complex "tall swamp 
blueberries." 
Note the three dimensions of variation 
exploited 
here: 
blue versus black, high (or tall) versus low, swamp versucs 
upland. 
Note also that this paradigmatic classification excludes 
the 
"dangle" 
and the "grouseberry" as well as the 
"cranberry," 
thus 
ignoring the Gaylussacia-Vacciniurn contrast 
the 
botanists 
stress. 
See 
interview 
(PFP83-FEH1008-pp. 
7-9) and 
blueberry 
industry tour with Brad Thompson, PFP84-AEHO11-013. 
Domestic 
varieties selected for period of 
maturation 
(the 
earliest 
varieties were ready to pick ca. 
`2 June 
1984, 
e. g. , 
"bluecrop," the latest mature into early August, 
e.g., 
"Eliot"), 
clustering 
of fruits (for ease of harvest), 
and disease resist--
ance, among other considerations. 
Initial domestications--so the 
story goes--was by selecting wild plants with the largest 
fruits:> 
for cuttings. 
Elizabeth White sent "pineys" out with boards with 
hales 
of 
various 
sizes drilled in there and 
paid 
for 
marking 
plants by size. 
Brad Thompson grouped varieties by vintage. 
Old 
strains 
were 
typically 
named for Coville 
family 
members, 
aS 
"Cabot," "Catherine," and "Coville." 
These were named for 
Marie 
Coville Thompson' s aunt and uncles. 
( 
Marie Coville Thompson is 
Frederick 
Coville's 
granddaughter and 
Brad 
Thompson's 
aunt.) 
Strains of intermediate age were also often named for people, 
at-5 
"Herbert," 
"Wolcott," 
and "Weymouth." 
New varieties are 
given 
more 
prosaic 
names 
such as "June," 
"Blue 
Crop," 
"Berkeley," 
"Blue-gray," "#287," and "White." 
Problems 
for 
the blueberry farmer include 
pests 
such 
as 
deer, 
fungi, 
insects, dodder (Cuscuta), weedy grasses that corn-•• 
pete for nutrients, 
and green briar (Smilax). 
Brad showed me a% 
locally designed machine, 
a "round mower," for cultivating blue--
berry 
fields, 
though 
he noted that "it's not as good 
as 
hand 
hoeing, 
of 
course, 
but it comes pretty close." 
 
Farmers 
near, 
Vincentown 
must 
fence 
their fields agains 
deer. 
They 
apply 
chemicals 
by hand to control weeds. 
Another pest is "stunt," 
et 
disease 
caused 
by some kind of insect that stunts 
the 
plants. 
Ma1athion is used to control stunt and "Captan" and even Paraquat 
are used in other applications. 
Brad is concerned by the health 
problems that such chemicals may cause. 
He complains of 
aller-
gies 
and 
fears 
that the kidney tumors of his 
grandfather 
and 
great uncle may have been caused by exposure to 
chemicals. 
Tara 
much 
rain, 
in 
Brad's opinion, 
is a more serious problem 
than 
drought, as blueberries mold easily. 
Since blueberries are adap-
ted to growing in dry sails, they have deep roots and can survive 
drought. 
Bueberries may set some fruit after four years but don't hit 
their stride until at least eight years old. 
Thereafter they may 
double their yields each year for several more years if carefully 
pruned. 
Brad's family has a division of labor. 
His father works 
at 
pruning all winter, 
his mother is expert on 
crop 
diseases, 
while 
Brad and his brother work full time at the harvest 
during 
32 
summer 
school 
vacation. 
The timing of the 
blueberry 
harvest 
makes 
it 
possible 
for academics to do blueberry farming 
as 
a 
part-time occupation. 
(pFp83-FEH1OO8-pp. 7-9) 
Brad 
is currently (June 1984) working on a presentation 
on 
the history of the cultivated blueberry for the Historical Socie-
ty. 
The Tur-Blue Coop was founded by Stanley coville, 
Frederick. 
Coville's son. 
The coop pioneered in the use of celophane in the 
U. S. 
Brad's family is #45 of more than 200 current coop 
member 
families. 
Brad's 
great 
uncle, 
Herbert Beebee 
developed 
the 
variety 
known 
as "Herbert." 
Brad's family plants six or 
seven 
varieties currently. 
Examples include "bluecrop," with fruit iri 
large, tight bunches, "Weymouth," less resistant than the last to 
Sheep 
Pen Hill disease but one of the earliest 
maturing 
varie-
ties. 
They have "Berkeleys," planted about cO years ago, 
which 
illustrate 
the 
older way of planting varieties 
intermixed 
(ncl 
longer 
preferred due to machine picking). 
"Junk" varieties are 
older varieties that didn't work out, 
such as "Grand Cocus" 
and 
"Pemberton." 
His great uncle's variety, 
the "Herbert," is still 
represented in the Chatsworth field, 
but is no longer favored in 
the 
market because it's "not pretty," i.e., 
it's a "gray 
crop" 
(i. e. , not blue, 
not "good color" but rather "flat and black. ") . 
Varieties 
also 
vary in sweetness, 
with "Weymouth" 
and 
"June" 
sweeter 
that "Bluecrop" and "Berkeley." 
Brad is concerned about 
preserving 
the 
older blueberry varieties. 
He fears 
that 
the 
public's ignorance or lack of appreciation 
of the subtleties 
of 
quality blueberries will lead to loss of varietal diversity. 
He 
suggests 
giving cuttings of older varieties to people interested 
in 
growing them in gardens, 
perhaps with a pamphlet 
explaining 
the 
history 
of the variety. 
As the plants may live 30 
to 
50 
years 
this 
could 
preserve 
them. 
Other 
varieties 
noted: 
"Coville," 
pulled out because not producing, 
replaced by 
"Wey--- 
mouth" five or six years ago. 
"Weymouth" is a "good cropper and 
early, and you get good money. 
And two, so you can get a machine 
in 
and out of there." 
(PFp84-AEHO11-pg. 
11) 
"Catherine" 
and 
"Cabot" 
are two older varieties named after a Coville sister and 
brother, 
(children 
of 
the botanist Frederick 
Coville 
who 
was 
instrumental--with Mrs. White--in developing the cultivated blue-­
berry 
industry). 
Varieties distinguished also on the basis 
of 
bush shape, 
leaf size and shape (whether broad or pointed), leaf 
color, etc. 
Bob 
Reeves is a friend of Brad 
Thompsons, 
another 
small 
blueberry 
farmer 
R coop member. 
The latest 
scourge 
of 
the 
cultivated blueberry--Sheep pen Hill disease--appeared first near 
his 
fields. 
It 
is 
now 
believed to 
be 
caused 
by 
a 
virusi> 
transmitted by a nematode via the root. 
He's last many plants to 
it 
and 
can do nothing but plow them under and hope the 
disease 
does 
not appear, in his other fields. 
The effects of Sheep 
Fen 
Hill disease, 
named after a local geographical site, are virtual 
elimination of fruit without apparent damage to the 
leaves. 
It 
doesn't 
affect 
the taste of the fruit, 
unlike "stump 
disease" 
which 
makes the fruit bitter. 
Bob plants the 
early 
fruiting 
"blues" (i.e., 
"bluecrop") as well as the late fruiting "Elliot" 
varieties (ready in late August). 
We discussed the role of bees 
in 
blueberry 
cultivation. 
Beekeepers are contracted 
with 
tc, 
bring 
in 
their bees, 
the "red bees," usually at one 
hive 
per 
3 
acre. 
The 
beekeeper travels all up and down the Atlantic Coast 
seasonally, 
pollinating 
a variety of crops including 
cranberry 
(now pollinating, late June 1984), Cape Cod cranberries next, and 
Florida citrus and truck crops (in the winter and early 
spring). 
Timing 
is 
critical. 
You 
wait 
until 
there 
is 
some 
"bloom 
showing ," then leave them for three to four weeks . 
"If you brinEl 
' 
em in too quick, 
they'll go out to the wildflowers. 
They spray 
after the bees are done. 
Bob prefers Dilox--which he has heard 
is 
non-toxic to humans--to Sevin--highly toxic to bees--for 
the 
control of gypsy moth. 
Gypsy moths do come onto the blueberries 
because 
there's not much oak in his immediate 
vicinity, 
mostly 
maple . 
Stump disease is caused by a virus and spread by a leaf 
hopper. 
Spraying with Malathion takes care of it. 
Reeves also 
has 
Weymouth 
(nearly 
wiped 
out by Sheep 
Pen 
Hill 
disease), 
"bluecrop" 
(seriously 
affected), 
and 
"Ruble" 
and 
"Jersey" 
varieties. 
Bob 
notes 
that 
his blueberry field 
was 
once 
a 
cranberry 
bog, 
and before that was wooded with maple and 
pine. 
Cranberry bogs without good water, 
i.e., 
"dry bogs," were 
con-
verted to blueberry cultivation.

Bill 
Wasiowich collects "wild huckleberries" which he 
says•> 
people 
sometimes prefer to commercial blueberries 
because 
they 
are not sprayed. 
The "swamp huckleberry" is currently (Oct. 
11, 
1983) 
the only type available due to frosts. 
The swamp habitat 
provides 
protection 
from frost, 
he 
claims.

EH#1652':' 
Locally 
known as "sugar huck," "upland blue 
huckleberry" 
(Jack 
Cervetto ), 
and 
considered 
the sweetest of all. 
It is 
a 
low 
growing , 
upland 
species, 
often 
associated 
with 
Gaylussacia 
baccata. 
Wayne Pittman and Bill Wasiowich collect "hock brush," 
the 
winter 
twigs of this species, 
for sale to 
Allyn 
Manufac-
turing, 
etc., 
for 
decorative use. 
Pittman says "sugar

grows 
best 
on burnt over, areas. 
This species 
presumably 
the 
"small 
huckleberry" 
Toni Brown considers the "best

Jack 
Cervetto 
distinguishes this as "sugar hock" 
or

7 "low

upland huckleberry," 
 and notes it 
i 
sr, 
harvested commercially for decorative purposes, 
"add some decora-
tive 
ribbon 
to the bottom of it... 
it looks" pretty." 
Buyers 
require 
two foot lengths. 
Jack notes that this species predom-
inates 
over Gay1ussacia baccata in "oak bottom," vice 
versa 
iri 
"pine bottom. " 
Bill 
Wasiowich 
collects 
the fruit of this 
"sugar 
hock." 
They grow about 1.5 to 2 feet high. 
Pick them in July, 
first or-
second week, 
through August, 
sometimes into 
September. 
"They 
have to be dead right or they're not worth anything," says 
Bill. 
Cut

after the leaves have 
fallen. 
Sell to

At 
Allyn's

Vaccinium 
macrocarpon (Ait.) 
Large cranberry. 
EH#1572, 
1648. 
Occurs both wild in bogs and in cultivation. 
Originally 
culti-
vated in New England. 
Stone (1973 [19111, pp. 627-628) describes 
the 
preparation 
of 
cranberry bogs and the 
harvest 
techniques 
briefly. 
Eugene Vivian believes that "turfing" in the 
prepara-
tion 
of 
cranberry 
bogs 
created ideal habitat 
for 
rare 
Pine 
Barrens plants such as curly grass fern. 
Cultivated 
cranberries: 
are harvested beginning in September. 
Jack 
Cervetto 
notes 
that they have 
over 
1000 
acres 
in 
cranberry 
bog 
at Sim Place near his horse in Warren 
Grove. 
He 
notes that "savannah bottom" cleared for cranberry cultivation at 
Papoose 
bogs. 
Abandoned 
cranberry bogs revert to 
a kind 
of 
"siddious bottom" ("deciduous bottom" ?:EH), as one can often see:? 
the marks of past ditching. 
(PFP84-AEHO05-pg. 5) 
Bill 
identified 
this as "wild cranberry" in 
his 
sphagnum 
bog. 
He says it's edible but not worth picking. 
He noted that 
it was now (Oct.  09, 
1983) cranberry picking season, that workers 
are 
paid hourly plus a bonus if they stick on the job to the end 
of the season. 
Many don't. 
You can pick until freeze-up. 
Denny 
Doyle 
and 
Egad Thompson estimate 
that 
New 
Jersey 
annual cranberry production is about the same as for blueberries, 
i.e., 
ca. 28 million pounds @ $50/100 lb. 
barrel ($0.50/lb versus 
ca 
$0.60/lb. 
for blueberries). 
Cranberries marketed by 
Oceari 
Spray; 
blueberries 
by 
True-Blu. 
Some blueberry growers 
have 
interest in Ocean Spray also, 
e.g., 
Bill Haynes is president of 
Ocean Spray, 
according to Brad. 
Cranberry cultivation couch more 
capital intensive than blueberry cultivation. 
Bob Reeves reports 
that 
local cranberry culture began right near his place 
in 
the 
Sheep 
Pen 
Hill 
area 
(named because local people 
drove 
their-
sheep 
here 
during the Revolutionary War to hide them 
from 
the 
British:Bob Reeves), started by the Bud's in the mid-1800s. 
Freeman Taylor noted such cranberry varieties--attributed to 
Miss 
White 
of Whitesbog--as 
"Champions," 
"Haws" 
(spelling?), 
"Jersles," 
"Blacks," 
and 
a blue 
cranberry. 
"Howl" 
are 
now 
preferred 
because 
they are resistant to rot. 
"Blacks" 
mature 
early, 
in September. 
More information on this topic should 
be 
forthcoming from Taylor.

Leo complains that the government no longer--
allows 
harvesting 
this grass in dune

Leo 
quips,

Leo claims that the plant survives on sand 
dunes-i> 
because it keeps growing as the sand is piled up around it by the 
wind, 
so 
that you might have to dig down `0 feet to 
reach 
the.? 
roots, 
at the level the plant began growing. 
As with many other

He 
distinguishes 
it from a grass called "bluebert"

"bluebend," 
the 
Indian

Spartina patens Ait. 
Salt meadow grass. 
EH#1675. 
This is the 
primary species cut as salt hay on the Delaware Bay shore. 
It is 
also 
abundant over large tracts of salt marsh along the Atlantic^ 
shore. 
George Campbell, Sr., calls it "yellow hay." 
The Chinese 
strawberry farmers in central New Jersey want Just "yellow 
hay," 
while 
other 
users accept a mix of "yellow hay," 
"black 
grass" 
(Juncos gerardi), 
"rosemary" (Distichlis), 
and even some phrag--
mites. 
Salt hay in general is superior to "sweet hay" (e.g., 
a 
mixture 
of timothy, 
orchard grass, 
etc., 
grown in upland pas-
tures) or other materials because it is resistance to 
deteriorra-•• 
tion 
in 
water. 
It 
is used primarily today as 
art 
insulation 
material 
for winter, 
underground cement work. 
It has 
a very 
narrow tolerance in terms of salt water coverage, thus rising sea 
levels 
on 
the 
Delaware Bay shore over the 
last 
50 
yearshave 
necessitated 
diking 
to protect the salt hay fields. 
For 
more 
detail see PFP84-FEHO317-pp.

FEHO620-pp. 
2-5, AEHXXX, and 
Jens Lund's notes. 
Stewart Carnbell, 
George's younger son, 
re-
ports that they ship about 100 truck loads/year, at 420 bales (75 
lbs. 
per bale) per load, which at this year's price ($4.50/bale, 
up frorn $3.50 the past few years, 
cf. 
$2.00-2.50/bale 
 for sweet 
hay) should produce about $200,000 gross, which gives ca. $15,000 
annually to each of the three families (George, Sr., George, Jr., 
and Stewart). 
This, he says, 
is just enough to pay the bills but 
not 
enough 
to 
"get 
ahead" or 
to 
"build 
anything." 
George 
Campbell, Sr., notes that this species is the lowest of the three 
salt marsh grasses in his habitat zonation scheme, 
above "sedge" 
but 
generally slightly below "rosemary" and they, 
"black 
grass" 
higher 
still, 
but 
all below the upland Phragmites 
and 
"elder-
brush" 
zone. 
He recognizes a coarser variety of "yellow 
salt" 
that 
grows at the edges of the marsh. 
This may be the 
variety 
once 
distinguished 
as 
Spartina luncea by Merrill 
(Stone 
1973 
46 
119113:233). 
Awareness of the importance 
 of difference of eleva-
tion 
 
measured in inches allows salt hay farmers such 
as 
George 
Campbell, Sr., to perceive long-term sea level changes, as he has 
noted 
along 
 the Delaware Bay share. 
One major parasite of salt 
hay noted, 
an "army worm," but he's against spraying to 
control 
it. 
Jim 
Stasz 
notes that "salt hay" was once used 
to 
make 
a 
coarse paper, 
a Pine Barrens industry killed by competition from 
more effective paper making processes developed elsewhere. 
Leo 
Landy 
says 
they don't harvest the

machinery, etc.

TYeha latifolis L. 
Broad-leaved cattail. 
Less abundant than thc-:• 
preceding and more restricted to fresh water pond 
margins. 
Cut 
and dried for the decorative plant market by Hazel and Leo Landy, 
but 
not 
as important as "miniature cats," the 
variously 
sized 
populations of the next. The broad-leaved cattails are advertised 
by the Landy's as "jumbo cats" and sold for 25 cents each. 
Cattails 
generally 
are considered very important food 
for, 
muskrats 
and 
an 
important material used by 
muskrats 
in 
con-
structing their houses (T. 
Brown,

you 
"can 
almost 
subsist off them," grinding t_(p the

Bill Lee agrees that

is "wonderful for the muskrats," though he believes that 
"three-square" roots is also good muskrat food.

Smilax rots_►ndifolia L. 
Greenbrier.

one with "stickers" [but fewJ, 
the other with "stingers," 
i.e., 
"bull briar" is the 
one that sticks you.... 
Nobody'll mess with

Bull briar has a root "as white as milk, 
and apart every 
foot there's a great big knob. 
And that knob is what my 
grand-
mother 
used to use to make some kind of tea for women's 
urinary 
tract.... 
I remember when I was only eight, nine years old, she 
used 
to 
get 
me out in the woods and make me dig 
up 
different 
roots and stuff."
