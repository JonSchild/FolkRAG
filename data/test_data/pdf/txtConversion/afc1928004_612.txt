Just three years ago sure we came to this land, 
Two gentlemen from Ireland's green sod; 
We came to this country our fortunes to seek, 
And trusted in him whose above. 
Our hearts never glad for our thoughts makes us sad, 
And to Ireland returning once more; 
Although we are here our hearts they are there, 
With our loving old parents at home. 
Cnonus. 
Our hearts never glad for our thoughts makes us sad, 
And to Ireland retttrning once more; 
Although we are here are hearts they are there, 
With our loving old parents at home. 
Now that we're rich, boys, we're going back home, 
To that beautiful city of Kerry; 
Where the girls and the boys will welcome us back, 
And the scenes once again will be merry. 
Now kind folks in front we have told you our tale, 
And we hope now by us you will stand; 
And see Ireland's dear name, yet be proclaimed, 
A 
free nation throughout this great laud. 
•Sung by MURPHY & M ILES. 
Written by " Mr. John Murphy," and 
dedicated to " Burk & Bligh." 
Sure our story is of a 
lovely little fairy, 
Who milks the cows upon her father's farm; 
And the lovely name she bears is pretty Mary, 
And her roguish eyes is like a 
charm. 
She's far prettier than the best picture ever painted, 
Purer than the lilies or the rose; 
The envy of all young lovers' hearts 
Is the fairest flower that grows. 
Cuonus: 
When the shades of evening fall, we tarry,—Break. 
And the angel of my heart I'm going to marry.—Break. 
We're as happy as two doves that live in the mansion, 
Or the rich that wear the finest clothes; 
The joy and treasure of my heart; 
Is the fairest flower that grows. 
There will be a 
happy time when we are married, 
It will be merry moments of our life; 
To think of the girl we loved and would have mar-
ried, 
And settled down and led a 
happy life. 
If we live to be a 
jolly aged couple, 
We'll see that the old back gate is closed; 
When the moon shines bright, we'll kiss good- night, 
To the fairest flower that grows. 
SUNNY MOUNTAIN HOME. 
This is a 
very popular song in New York. 
Written by " Ben. J. Miles," and sung only by MURPHY & M ILES, the 
great favorites. 
Why did we ever roam from our dear old Irish home, 
The dear old home that was so bright and gay; 
And the friends we left behind to us were good and kind, 
When we left old.Ireland for America. 
They kindly cheered us on that bright summer's morn, 
As we parted from our loved ones at the shore; 
We are never free from care for our hearts are ever there, 
In our pretty mountain home in dear old Erin. 
CHORUS. 
Our hearts are never glad, for our thoughts do make us 
sad, 
And it's for our sweet-hearts now that we are caring; 
We do regret the day that we went so far away, 
From our sunny mountain home in dear oid Erin. 
We have traveled through this land, and saw places that 
were gram!, 
But there's sights to see in Ireland all the same; 
These dear familiar scenes, we can see them in our dreams, 
Around that dear old home from where we came. 
Where the lads are gay and witty, and the girls so sweet 
and pretty, 
day that we shall see them it is nearing; 
But we do regret the day that we went so far away, 
From our pretty mountain home in dear old Erin. 
(Chorus). 
When our name is engraved on the 
Whitehouse. 
Recited by ":John Murphy." Written by " James Richmond," for 
MURPHY Sz MILES. 
I 
am going to run for President, 
My name is Alexander McGee; 
And if I 
get elected. 
I'd set old Ireland free. 
I 
am going to be Vice- President, 
Then politicians can't live at their ease; 
I'd make them go and clean the streets, 
Or vaccinate the Chinese. 
I'll put muzzles on all the Senators, 
Give boot-blacks all new suits; 
Put the Italians in the Custom House, 
And have Congressmen blacking boots. 
I'll move New York to Washington, 
Make Parnell :klinister to Greece; 
Put an Irish Flag on the White I 
louse, 
And put Grant on the Police. 
Build the Brooklyn Bridge to Hoboken, 
have Dennis Kearney for a 
pal; 
Plant potatoes in the City Hall Park, 
And make Garfield go back on the canal. 
You'd ride to California by telegraph, 
And John Kelly will eat water rolls, 
I'd make Conkling and Platt carry the hod, 
Or whitewash the Election Day polls, 
WHEN OUR NAME IS ENGRAVED ON TIIE 
W IITE-HOUSE—CONTINUED. 
I'd call Tammany Hall the Thieves' Hotel, 
Cause the country's debt they raise; 
There would be no Post Office, you'd make 
your own stamps, 
And the Queen of England would marry 
ft 
President Hayes. 
I'd make all the Aldermen bottle fog, 
Also the Judges, Sheriffs and Mayors; 
I'd give Workingmen ninety dollars a 
day, 
To banish Wall Street Bears. 
FINALE—By 
both. 
We'd build an awning over the world, 
You'd never have to get shaved; 
There'll be better times and barrels of wine, 
When on the White-House our name is 
engraved. 
MARY ANN O'GRADY. 
Music published by " Bruns & Kaufmann," 791 Broadway, near 10th 
Street. 
Written by " Ben. J. Miles," and sung only by 
MuttPriv & Mity.s, the great impersonators of the 
Irish character. 
Oh! here we are two Irish boys, 
Just came across the sea; 
For singing or for dancing, 
I 
think that we'll please ye; 
We left behind in Erin's Isle, 
Our Colleens young and fair, 
And soon then we'll go back again, 
And dance upon the green. 
CHORUS. 
Mary Ann O'Grady, 
You are the girl for me, 
And soon then we'll g
-o 
back again, 
Where the Shamrocks grows so green. 
So now kind folks we must away, 
We can no longer stay; 
We're going to old Ireland. 
With hearts so bright and gay; 
We're going to see the girls we love, 
And with them we'll remain; 
The boys will dance, and the girls will sing, 
When we go home again. 
THE TWO IRISH BOYS. 
Music can be had at " Bruns & Kaufmann," 791 Broadway, near 10th 
Street. 
Written by MURPHY & Mums, whose new Songs and 
Dances never fail to please. 
Oh, here we are from Ireland, 
As you can plainly see; 
We took a 
trip on a 
great big ship, 
To sail to America. 
We landed at Castle Garden, 
Sure three weeks ago to-day; 
We'll drink success to the Irish boys, 
That's in old Ireland. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes we are two Irish boys, 
That came across the sea; 
For singing or for dancing, 
I 
think that we'll please ye. 
We landed at Castle Garden, 
Sure three weeks ago to-day; 
We'll drink success to the Irish boys, 
That's in old Ireland. 
When we landed in America, 
Sure we hadn't no place to go; 
We had no friends to harbor us, 
We didn't know what to do. 
We wandered along through Broadway, 
When a 
man took us by the band; 
Says he, my boys, I 
can tell by your face, 
Your from old Ireland, 
(Chorus). 
MARY ANN, I'LL TELL YOUR MA. 
Written and Composed by GEOFFREY THORN. Sung with great success 
by TONY PASTOR, America's own vocalist, 
this 
song is published by permission of E. If. IIARIANG, 
:229 Bowery, New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half-pence, and a 
precious deal of love; 
She's living with her mother, as a 
maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to 
know; 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
Some heads pop round the corner. and a 
vulgar voice will 
shout— 
CHORUS: 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your Ma, 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far; 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, tie! for shame, Yah! yah! yah! Oh ! vali 
We went last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail, 
I 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not hear the sun; 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go, 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shiouted— 
(Chorus). 
MARY ANN, I'LL TELL YOUR MA.—CONTINUED. 
We wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be, 
We thought from vulgar people there, we should at least 
be free; 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, whe:e none our vows 
could hear, 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so 
dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
-While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and 
kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
(Chorus), 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd 
roam; 
My Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must:know her way about; 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
A voice came down the staircase, and her little brother 
cried— 
SOKEN.—Ohl oh! oh! 
(Chorus), 
Sang by NED BARRY at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre Comique, 
Broadway, New York. 
There's an old fashioned house in the old country, 
There's an old fashioned couple live there; 
There's an old fashioned gate by the old country road. 
And an old fashioned man near the chair; 
An old fashioned woman is sitting there, 
Darning an old pair of hose; 
With her old fashioned cap on her old fashioned head 
And she's dressed in her old fashioned clothes. 
Cnontas: 
near those bells, those merry bells, 
And they fill my soul with a 
thrill; 
'Tis the old fashioned sound from them old fashioned bells, 
In that old fashioned church on the hill. 
There's an old fashioned clock on that old whitewashed 
wall, 
With its old fashioned pendulum and hands; 
There's an old wooden bench by that old fireplace, 
With its bright copper kettles and pans; 
An old fashioned man is sitting there, 
Smoking his old fashioned clay; 
With his old favorite dog sitting close by his side, 
Watching the children at play. 
Heaven bless that dear old pair, may they live for many. 
years, 
in that dear, little house in the lane; 
May they never know a 
care, but all happiness to share 
And think of the dear, old happy days; 
The same I 
wish to you, with a 
heart of conscience true 
May you live, yes, for many, many years; 
May you never want for wealth, but enjoy the best of 
health, 
It is the earnest wish I 
give to you.

Greatest Grotesque Clown. 
There it stands in the corner with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall; 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom. 
For no one now uses that back parlor room; 
Oh, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and I; 
And we listened to the stories that our grandma would tell 
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so well. 
Cnortus: 
AF 
-...e 
sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim awl tall, 
in that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
If till: chair could but speak, oh, the tales it could tell, 
how poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell; 
'Neath the st ti's and the stripes he fought bravely and true 
Ile cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue; 
CoUld tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day \viten dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
(Chorus). 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
tier children have followed her, yes, one by one; 
They have all gone to meet her " in the sweet by and-bye," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I; 
Never more will we hide her gold specks or her cap, 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more Will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stood by the wall.

You Were False, But I'll Forgive You. 
Sung with immense success by Miss Georgie Melnotte 
the Queen Serbo-Comique. 
Fare thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
Now I 
bid you all farewell. 
You have wrecked the hiart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me day by day, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.; 
When I 
saw your eyes in virtue, 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your oice in anger, 
it was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two nib:so; 
One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it be ? 
No word not one word of pleasure, 
You believe them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

Oh my name is Gilhooly Cornelius Gilh000ly, 
I 
live on the 1st Avenue; 
I'm a 
hard working- man from the dear Irish land, 
With a 
heart that is honest and true; 
Every night just before 1 
lay down to my rest, 
I 
call to my wife "(ducky" dear; 
Bun around to Maguire's, it's now I 
desire, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
Cif onus: 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer, Mollie, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer; 
-Whom I'm dry it will fill me with cheer, Mollie, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
Then we sit down together and talk of the weather, 
And tell the events of the day; 
When the pitcher is empty, we fill it again, 
And in pleasure the night flies away; 
place where we live is a 
fine Irish flat, 
And our neighbors are full of good cheer; 
If you want to be happy, just come and imbibe, 
From the Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
You may talk of your wines with their high sounding 
names, 
Whisky Punches and Hot Spicy Rum; 
But the Beer is the stuff, and it's quite good enough, 
For your Senses it can't overcome; 
If my friends call around, they'll have pleasure and 
fun, 
On a 
Christmas or happy New Year; 
Well bring out Glass Goblets and off I 
will go, 
For the Little Brown Pitcher of Beer.

If I 
Catch The Man Who Taught 
Her to Dance. 
Vritten, composed and sung by W M. J. 
ScANT...ort, in SCANLON & 
CaoNIN's 
famous sketch, entitled •• Life In a 
Tenement House." 
I've got a 
daughter I 
talk to all day, 
But the devil a 
word will she mind what I 
say, 
a 
spite of advice she'll go far away, 
Sometimes she cannot be found. 
If I 
say stay at home, begorra she'll get mad, 
She'll call me an ould tad, say I've got them bat 
X.nside of an oyster I 
ought to be clad, 
To a 
nannie goat I 
ought to be bound. 
CHORUS. 
All, but if I 
catch the man 
That taugi.,:. her to dance 
The la-de-da dance, the tra-le-la dance, 
On the top of his nose I'll make my fist prance, 
And twist oil the botn of his legs, ha, ha! 
(Repeat.) 
At night she'll put on her fol-de-lol-lols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand calls, 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll wear my coderie pants, 
My chin-chilly vest, or anything by chance, 
But if I 
catch the laddie-buck that taught her to dance, 
I'll twist off the both of his legs. 
As sung by M R. STANLEY GREY with tremendous success, at the 
SAN FRANCISCO MINSTRELS. 
Last night I 
was dreaming of you, 
And bright happy moments gone by, 
We trod the old paths that we knew, 
Ere absence had caused us to sigh. 
Kind friends and companions were near, 
A merry and mirth-loving throng, 
With links of relationship dear, 
To bind us life's pathway along. 
I 
saw the sweet smile that you wore, 
As we gazed on the friends that we knew. 
I 
beard the same voice as of yore, 
That told of a 
bosom so true. 
And long did that pleasure remain, 
And joyous each spirit did seem— 
Oh vision return once again, 
Or quickly fulfilled be the dream.

Oh, come, my darling, 'tis just the hour, 
When moonbeams dance o'er all the happy earth and sea; 
We, too, will dance, my dove, while star beams gleam, my 
love, 
Oh, scorn not moments made for love and thee. 
Then kiss me, darling, and say you love me, 
And arm in arm together we will glide along; 
Sweet music sounding, light hearts are bounding, 
While merrily I 
sing your song. 
Sweet, my own, oh, come into my arms, 
Here alone, secure from ev'ry harm; 
Not a 
care, free as air, 
Come, my love, and gaily dance around. 
Come, kiss me, darling—I 
know what love is: 
Two pretty little arms that 'round my neck entwine, 
Two ruby lips, my love, that warmly kiss, my love; 
Two pretty eyes of azure blue like thine. 
Then kiss me, darling, and say you love me, 
And arm in arm together we will glide along; 
Sweet music sounding, light hearts are bounding, 
While merrily I 
sing your song. 
Sweet, my own, oh, come into my arms, 
Here alone, secure from Wry harm; 
Not a 
care, free as air, 
Come, my love, and gaily dance around.

CISCO M INSTRELS 
Only a 
face at the window, 
Only a 
face, nothing more; 
Yet the look in the eyes as they meet mine, 
Still comes to me o'er and o'er. 
Only a 
word of greeting, 
Only a 
word, that was all; 
Yet all day in my heart it echo'd 
Like the sound of an angel's call. 
Only a 
smile of welcome, 
Only a 
smile as I 
passed; 
Yet that smile will still be remembered 
As long as my life shall last. 
Only a 
woman, you tell me, 
Only a 
woman to thee; [ eth 
Yet there's naught that this wide world contain. 
Half so dear as this woman to me. 
.Massa's in the Cold Ground. 
Sung with great success by Barlow, Wilson, Primrose St West's Minstrels, 
Round de meadows am a 
ringing 
The darkies' mournful song, 
While the mocking-bird is singing, 
Happy as the day is long. 
Where the ivy is a 
creeping 
O'er the grassy mound, 
There old massa is a 
sleeping, 
Sleeping in the cold, cold ground. 
CHORUS. 
Down in the corn-field 
Hear that mournful sound; 
All the darkies are a 
weeping— 
Massa's in the cold, cold ground. 
When the autumn leaves were failing, 
When the days were cold, 
'Twas hard to hear old massa calling, 
Cause he was so weak and old. 
Now the orange tree is blooming 
On the sandy shore, 
Now the summer days are coming, 
Massa never calls no more. 
Down in the corn-. field 
Massa made the darkies love him, 
He always was so kind, 
Now they sadly weep above him, 
Mourning, for he leave them behind. 
Sung with great success by TONY PAsToR. 
How often we hear old fogies declare, 
If they could live over again; 
They'd never get wed or caught in a 
snare, 
But play quite a 
different game; 
It's all very well for people to talk, 
Of things in this world they would do; 
But start them again, you'd find they would walk 
The same path of life they've gone through. 
SroKEN.—Look at the married man after his day's toil. 
He rushes home to his family and his evening meal, which 
is accompanied by the baby- screaming the roof off. 
He 
says, " What an idiot a 
man must be to marry!" 
The 
wife says, " If I 
were to die to-morrow, you'd get married 
in a 
month," to which he replies: 
CHORUS: 
Never again, love, never again, 
Smiles are bewitching and women are vain; 
Husbands are soft that never complain, 
You've had me this time, love, but never again. 
How awful bewitching the old woman is, 
Whenever.she wants a 
new dress; 
She'll ask her sweet babe to kiss his papa, 
And puts on a 
smile of the best; 
• 
NEVER AGAIN—CONTINUED. 
The husband, poor lamb, is dragged to a 
shop, 
To see how much money she'll waste; 
And when he is there, of course he must shop, 
Because he has got such a 
taste. 
SPOKEN.— Poor devil! the wife orders twenty yards of 
Filk at three dollars a 
yard. 
The old boy goes home sing-
'Jag— 
Never again, love, etc. 
Sweet honeymoons and connubial bliss, 
Are all very nice, I 
dare say; 
But some married couples are always amiss, 
They're fighting and rowing all day; 
The wife says, " I'm sure I'll go home to ma, 
And thus from a 
brute I'll remain; 
But when she starts out, she finds it's too far, 
And turns to her dear home again. 
SPOKEN.— And laying her head artfully on his shoulder, 
says, " James, dear, you won't tell me to boil my face in 
the fish- kettle 
again, will you, darling?" 
He, in an 
instant, says—

My name is McNamara, - 
And I 
came from County Clare, 
in the darling little Isle across the sea, 
Where the mountains and the hills, 
And the brooks and rippling rills, 
Are Nature's sweetest music all the day. 
Our little farm was small; it could not support us all 
So one of us was forced away from home. 
And I 
bade them all good bye, 
With a 
tear drop in my eye, 
And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone. 
Ononus. 
I'm an honest Irish lad, 
And of work I'm not afraid, 
if it's pleasure to you I 
will sing and dance, 
Yes, I'll do anything you say, 
If you will only name the day, 
When they'll give an honest Irish lad a 
chance. 
When I 
landed in New York, 
tried hard to get work, 
Yes, I 
traveled through the streets from day to du; 
And I 
went from place to place, 
With starvation in my face, 
(Continued). 
When I 
ask for work they want no help, they say, 
Yet still I 
wandered on, 
In hopes I 
would find one, 
Who would give alad a 
chance to earn his bread, 
But I 
find it's all the same, 
And I 
know I'm not to blame, 
And I 
often times have wished that I 
was dead. 
• 
(CharIl8.) 
But I 
know I 
have one kind friend, 
Who a 
helping hand will lend 
To a 
poor boy and help him on at home,' 
And I'll bring my mother here, 
And my little sister, dear, 
And never from them more again I'll roam. 
I 
will try and do what's right, 
I 
will work both day and night, 
Yes, I'll try and do the very best I 
can, 
And God will bless the heart 
That will take a 
poor boy's part, 
And make an honest Irish lad a 
man,

There's sixteen dacent families 
In the house where I 
reside; 
On summer nights to cheer ourselves 
All pleasures we have tried, 
But on the roof it's best of all, 
To hear us would be proof, 
We make the neighborhood resound, 
All singing on the roof. 
Cnonus: 
Singing on the roof, the boys and girls touther. 
We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo, 
The .111urphys and O'Neils come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms, 
With pleasant conversation then, 
Sure every one she charms. 
There's Rosy Dunn and Reiley's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud, they join the crowd, 
All singing on the roof.

Sure, none could hold aloof, 
It was a

To sec them on the roof. 
Singing, etc. 
Now that's the place to spend the night, 
And feel that pleasant breeze, 
Take up your pipe and stretch yourself 
In an attitude of ease. 
The boys and girls will gather round, 
And till the air with glee, 
When singing on the roof at night, 
As happy as can be.

THE FISHERMAN AND HIS CHILD. 
Sung by Tom DIXON at the San Francisco Minstrels, and made 
Popular by JAMES O'NEIL.

The fisherman and his child are drowned, 
Came ringing through the town; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around; 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
Oh, God! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk-white sails I 
see. 
(Repeat last 2 
linag.) 
Cnonus: 
'Twas the voice of their God that they heard 
As they sank in the deep; 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep, 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
Thy precious soul I'll keep. 
The fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
He tried to sive his child, 
He battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind was howling wild; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
He cried in despair: Thy will be done! 
The child he loved was dead. 
(Repeat 2 
last lines.) 
And when the storms ceased, the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore, 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore, 
Their faces were calm, their hands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life had clasped his child, 
In death they found him there.

last lines,)

Grandmother's Chair.

Musk at E.

HARDING'S, 229 Bowery, 
Copyrighted. 
My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pounds, 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold -and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You can then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, &c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life, 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
1 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay at home, 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found, 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair? 
And how they titter'd, &e.

When I 
see her sure my heart goes in a

She is thoroughly conversant wid the art of etiquette, 
And at cards she'd beat old Hoyle himself a 
game. 
Oh, she'd play you whist or cribbage, forty-fives or casino, 
And she'll dale the cards just like a 
II anthill' man, poker 
peaknuckle, or Sauky oh Pedro, 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
She's a 
darling, &c. 
My Mary Anne's a 
dancer in the art of terpsichore, 
You should see her forward four and alamandi • 
She'd break up all the lumber that you'd put down on the floor, 
Such a 
heavy stepper is my Mary Anne. 
Oh, she'd dance you the mazourka, a 
polka or quadrille, 
Reel or jig or shuffle in the sand, schottishe or the German you 
could'nt keep her still. 
Such an education has my Mary .B.nne. 
She's a

Many a 
man grows tired and weary, 
As he toils life's road along; 
Everything looks dark and dreary, 
All he does seems to go wrong; 
Yet, I 
say, never be despairing, 
Fortune yet may smile some day; 
And her gifts with you be sharing, 
So remember what I 
say. 
CHORUS: 
Never, boys, give way to sorrow, 
Sighing only is in vain; 
For the sun will shine to-morrow, 
And the grass will grow again. 
Though false friends should all forsake you, 
Laugh their dirty trick to scorn; 
Luck some day may overtake you, 
When you look the most forlorn; 
Troubles in this world are plenty, 
Few from them are always free; 
Though your pockets should be empty, 
Still take this advice from me. (Chorus)

My Mother-In-law. 
Sung with great success by HARRY McAvoY at the London Theatre, 
New York, in the sketch of " Jealousy or Two Can Play at that 
Game," and in all the principal theatres in America. 
If you'll listen while I 
will sing you a 
ditty— 
It's about the worst woman that ever you saw, 
And when you have heard it you'll say it's a 
pity 
That ever I 
had such a 
mother-in-law. 
Whatever I 
do she is always fault finding, 
Wherever I 
goshe is sure to be there, 
And if I 
don't do why just as she asks me, 
She wiil help herself to a 
lock of my hair. 
CHORUS. 
My life is all troubles, I 
cannot live happy, 
If I 
open my mouth she will shove in her jaw, 
I'd rather be sent to jail or to congress 
Than to live all my life with my mother-in-law. 
Now she is so ugly she frightens the children 
Whenever she happens to go out in the street, 
She's a 
hole in hei mouth like a 
crack in a 
pumpkin, 
A hump on her back—I'll never mention her feet, 
And she's got a 
nution that she is good-looking, 
Though her face is the worst one that ever was seer., 
And when she sits down to have her picture taken, 
The very first squint she breaks the machine. 
My life is, &c. 
Now I 
told her one day when I 
married her daughter, 
That I 
did not intend the whole family to wed, 
When she quick helped herself to a 
bucket of water 
And taking good aim let it fly at my head. 
Now I've heard that they had some good shooting at 
Creedmoor, 
And the shots were so close they were all but a 
draw, 
But I'd give ten dollars to any good shooter, 
That could rid me at once of my mother-in-law. 
My 
life is, &c.

THE VILLAIN STILL PURSUED HER 
0:-
As sung by (ho. THATCHER with great success. The greatest hit of 
the day. 
My song is of a 
beauty, 
She's a 
Chinese- washer and fluter, 
She had money much, 
And her dad was Dutch, 
But the villain still pursued her. 
On one stormy moonlight evening, 
For to meet her humble suitor, 
She slipped on a 
pie, 
Run the crust in her eye, 
But the villain still pursued her. 
Oh, now my story's ended, 
She married a 
French horn tooter; 
And she died very dead 
With a 
cold in her head, 
And the villain still pursued her.

RESPECT SHOW TO OLD AGE. 
Words and Music by JAMES J. 
LESLIE, and sang by FIELDS k LESLIE 
with immense success in all the Theatres throughout the United 
States. (New York's Greatest Favorites). 
Behold our smiling faces, 
Overjoyed with happiness; 
Our cup of joy it has been filled 
With sunshine and with bliss; 
Old age is creeping on us now, 
And feeble grows our gait; 
This is our golden wedding day, 
And the young folks celebrate. 
CHORUS: 
Obedient to your parents be, 
Each word should bring a 
charm; 
Protect now and provide for them, 
And shield them from all harm. (Repeat). 
Now, young folks, take this moral, 
To you each and every one; 
Your parents cannot always last, 
You'll miss them when they're gone; 
They cherished and protected you, 
And nursed you in their arms; 
And brought you up to manhood, 
So shield them from all harm. (Chorus). 
As sting with great success by TONY PASTOR. The greatest and 
most popular song in New York. 
Don't call me weak-minded, perchance I 
should sing, 
Of the dearest old spot upon earth; 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring, 
To my mind the dear land of my birth; 
With its hills and its valleys, its mountains and vales, 
Of which our forefathers would boast; 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ah, but list' and I'll give you an Irishman's toast. 
Cuonus: 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen, 
here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam, 
Through the castle that stood on the hill; 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air. 
(Chorus). 
The church and the schoolhouse have long been replaced, 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host; 
The white-haired old veteran has long been at rest, 
And his wife has deserted her post; 
King Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er the seas; 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot, 
Still this toast seems to waft to my ears on the breeze, 
(Chorus).

I

Of a

He's been married, I

With six babies his life to encumber; 
While there is poor me, who's been wed about three

Now there's General Grant, our Ex-President, 
He fought for the Star Spangled Banner; 
But the people do say that he'll fast forty days, 
For every one knows he's a

He has also been over Europe I'm told, 
They say he's as rich as a 
Jew; 
But why he don't retire to sweet private life, 
I 
can't understand, can you?

I

'Why we have a 
Mayor, by the way, who says 
Grace every day, 
I

There's the handsome young lady, the belle of the 
day, 
Who is always dressed up in the fashion; 
Her beautiful form is developed to sight, 
She looks very stylish and dashing; 
With a 
sweet little bang on the front of her head, 
And she's made up quite pretty to view; 
But why she combs her hair on the back of a 
chair 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
CHORUS: 
I

don't understand, do you?

Of all the young swells that you ever seen, 
There's none for to equal us two La Da Das; 
We have just come over from the land of the green, 
Where we left the gang and our Ma Mas. 
We are noted for being two bashful young men, 
Especially where ladies are found; - 
If you go into any of the fashionable balls, 
You will hear the word go around. 
Cnonus: 
Oh, my! ain't they two babies, 
Look at the swells with the glass on their eye; 
Oh, yes, they're the pets of the ladies, 
Clarence and Arthur, now don't - they look fly. 
Now Clarence and Arthur, as everyone knows, 
Drinks wine from the keg as fast as it flows; 
Although we are not lushers that have a 
red nose; 
We go for the bowl as far as it goes. 
We don't care for money although we have none, 
Our parents are very well off; 
We get through on our face, if not on our shape, 
We are Clarence and Arthur the toffs. (Chorus).

Not far from the County Kildare;

I've enough and a

Sure I've not come over here seeking your jobs, 
But a

So be aisy and free while you're drinking with me, 
I'm a

I've a 
neat little colleen that dwells in my cot, 
Oh, happy, contented is she; 
I've a 
thumping big lad that will say to his dad, 
There's a 
man you don't meet every day; 
And when for my leisure I'm out for a 
walk, 
The boys they all stop and they stare; 
And they say to each other as I'm passing by, 
There's a

THE $5 
NOTE. 
A 
Comic Song sung by FRANK LEWIS, ESQ., with tremendous success 
everywhere through the country. Written by FRED SHAW. 
One night as I 
was out with the boys to have a 
spree, 
Thro' drinking whisky punches, I 
was drunk as I 
could be; 
My cash it quickly flew, I 
very soon was broke, 
So I 
borrowed from a 
friend a 
e5 note. 
Cnottus: 
If you listen to my song, while the funny things I'll quote, 
tell you how I 
spent that $5 
note. 
As soon as I 
was fixed, I 
asked the boys to have a 
bowl, 
Which into my note made a 
very big hole; 
We had a 
round of punches, and then cigars to boot, 
Up went the first dollar of the $5 
note. 
The boys feeling hungry after drinking so much punch, 
We walked around the corner and we had a 
little lunch; 
They tackled oyster stews ' till I 
thought the boys would 
choke, 
And they soon eat up a 
dollar of the e5 note. 
Then we went to the Theatre to see the ladies prance, 
And to hear the comic songs, and the funny song and dance; 
One of the girls says I 
feel thirsty, and brandy would suit 
my throat, 
And she soon drank a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then we walked around the town called in a 
saloon or two, 
Then we went to see the ladies as the young men often do; 
One said she loved me, with her arms around my throat, 
And she soon got a 
dollar of the $5 
note. 
Then as I 
was going home, just as drunk as I 
could be, 
A 
poor laboring man came slowly up to me; 
His family they were starving, and ragged was his coat, 
And he got the last dollar of the $5 
note.

TORPEDO AND THE WHALE. 
As sung by LESTER & W ILLIAMS. 
In our back yard there lives two bums, 
They can dance upon their gums; 
They never had no thumbs, 
And with Ben Butler they were chums. 
01101111s: 
Oh, they are crazy and lazy, 
Garfield and Hazey; 
They are gentlemen of rank, 
Cage them up in some big tank, 
And we'll let them rob some bank, 
Then bite off their nose. 
In our back alley lives a 
cat, 
And her maiden name is Pat; 
She could sleep in an old hat, 
And in a 
butcher's she eats fut. 
In our back alley lives a 
guy, 
And he never told a 
lie; 
lie is not afraid to die, 
And he makes his living stealing pie. 
Chorus. 
(Chorus) 
They ain't pleasing, they are teasing, 
Like lemons they need squeezing, 
lie's got warts upon his nose, 
He never wore no clothes, 
lie never sleeps, he'd always doze, 
And wash himself in soup. 
[Parody.] 
Composed by LON H AYLE. 
Air.—Empty Cradle. 
Little empty pig pen smells so nice and sweet, 
how the precious burden used to squeal ; 
We can have some roast pork and pickled pig's feet, 
And some fresh spare ribs every meal. 
We killed him with a 
knife at the right time of the moor, 
And scrubbed him till the break of dawn; 
Now he's in the barrel, salted for evermore, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone. 
CnOltUS 
Piggy's left the swill-trough to eat from it no more, 
O'er the briny water he has flown; 
Gone to join the Boers on Africa's shore, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone. 
Near the cellar door stands a 
barrel now, 
Overhead the cob-webs are thick; 
It always makes us sad when we think of him now, 
And the many times we scratched him with a 
stick. 
He could play seven up, and draw poker too, 
And sing all the latest songs; 
Now he's in a 
barrel packed forever more, 
Empty is the hog pen piggy's gone. (Chorus).

OH 
I 
fancy brings a 
thought to me 
Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there combined, 
And brightest hues so fair— 
So like a 
maiden that I 
loved— 
It was my happy lot: 
I 
whispered when we parted last— 
" 
Oh l 
you'll forget me not!" 
CHORUS. 
Graceful and as charming as a 
lily in the pond— 
Time has passed so swiftly—for, of her I 
am so fond--
Dasies and the roses, too, they grow around the spot 
Where we parted and I 
whispered— 
" 
You'll forget me not I" 
We met—I 
really don't know where— 
But still ' tis all the same— 
Par love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane: 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand: 
She glanced at me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up— 
A 
sweet forget-me-not1 
(Chorus and Dance.) 
At last there came a 
happy day 
And something that I 
said 
Just caused her lips to murmur " ves I" 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage by the brook, 
And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called— 
A 
sweet forget-me-not)

A Serenade. 
Written by imam DELlamxo, and sung by " THE DELMANING." 
Oh, the moon is out to-night, 
Sweet Irene; 
And my heart beats with delight, 
Dear Irene; 
I 
am lingering by the well, 
And I've something sweet to tell, 
When we wander through the dell, 
Sweet Irene. 
CHORUS: 
Sweet Irene, (Symp.,) dear Irene, (Symp.), 
Gently whisper, tell me darling, thou art mine; 
Sweet Irene, (Symp.), dear Irene, (Symp.), 
Gently whisper, tell me dearest, thou art mine. 
Underneath the old oak tree, 
Sweet Irene; 
I 
have whispered love to thee, 
Dear Irene; 
I 
said, I'd be here at eight, 
Down by the garden gate, 
For your answer to await, 
Sweet Irene. 
(Chorus).

Jon i 
WAL.sn, the Great Irish Vocalist, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, N. Y. 
I'll sing now in praise of the gem of old Ireland, 
Whose names are respected by friend and by foe; 
Of the men who proud to acknowledge their sireland, 
Of men who gained fame by words and by blow; 
Their hearts brave and true, never knew any danger, 
As cheerfully they for their country did toil; 
It must be acknowledged by friend and by stranger, 
That they were bright gems from the Emeral Isle. 
First is Brian Borue, the great King whose example 
If followed by Monarchs of this present day; 
A. blessing would prove, for his wisdom was ample, 
He knew how to rule in a 
true Kingly way; 
Brave Patrick Sarsfield, exiled from his sireland, 
Exclaimed as he died on a 
foreigner's soil; 
Oh, may heaven grant freedom for old Ireland, 
Then died a 
bright gem of the Emerald Isle. 
If we boast of our gems, surely no -one can blame uis, 
When we've produced men like those I 
will name; 
Balfe Wallace and Tom Moore who made themselvet, 
famous, 
With music and poetry they gained their fame; 
There's Sherridan, Goldsmith and Swift, three more 
great men, 
What nation on earth ever equaled their stZ,i 
There's Davitt, Daily and Killen, three more great 
Statesmen, 
All these are bright gems of the Emerald Isle.

In Scotland, Prance and Germany, 
Music you will hear, 
The Italian loves to play the harp, 
He plays so soft and clear. 
Sweet music always charms my ear, 
Wherever it may be, 
I 
love to hear Tom Moore's sweet songs, 
They have such harmony. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love music, I 
love singing, 
I 
love dancing—it's entrancing, 
I 
love babies, I 
love ladies, 
Yes, they're all the world to me. 
The Irish songs are soft and sweet, 
They harmonize so well, 
The Meeting of the Waters, 
Or the Emigrant's Fareweh. 
There's Bobby Burns, the great Scotch poet, 
Whose memory shall reign 
In Scotland where he lived and died, 
And honored was his name. 
In speaking of our poets great, 
There's one now whom I'll name, 
His praise is sung both far and near, 
He's well known for his fame. 
'Tis of William Cullen Bryant I 
speak, 
Who Americans will adore, 
His works are read throughoutthis world, 
From this to foreign shore.

Price 30 cents. 
I've wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
Oh the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray, 
Oh, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, e¼. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was filled with pain, 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again. 
Oh, the good old days,

Price,

As sung in the Opera of " Billee Taylor" by 
TONY PASTOR AND COMPANY. 
The yarn as I'm about to spin, 
Is all on account of Eliza; 
I'll tell you how I 
was taken in, 
All on account of Eliza; 
She said that she'd ever be true to one, 
But she bolted away with a 
son of a 
gun! 
So I 
cut my stick and to sea I 
run, 
That it's all on account of Eliza. 
CHORUS: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
He cut his stick and to sea he run, 
All on account of Eliza. 
I've nearly been blown away in a 
gale, 
All on account of Eliza; 
And I've almost been eaten up by a 
whale, 
All on account of Eliza; 
I've had sword cuts by dozens, and I've been shot, 
through, 
I've had yellow fever and also the blue; 
I've been bitten by sharks, and by crocodiles, too, 
All on account of Eliza. 
CHORUS: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
He's been bitten by sharks, and by crocodiles, too 
All on account of Eliza. 
My duty is now, smart lads, to press, 
All on account of Eliza; 
If they say " No!" why I 
say " Yes!" 
All on account of Eliza; 
So look up, my messmates, some boys for the sea 
And if to your summons they do not agree, 
Why, shiver my timbers, just tell 'em from me, 
That it's all on account of Eliza. 
Crtottus: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
Why, shiver my timbers, just tell 'em says he, 
That it's all on account of Eliza. 
I've courted the ladies all through my life, 
All on account of Eliza; 
But never could steer to the proper wife, 
All on account of Eliza; 
I've kissed and I've hugged them in ev'ry port, 
The fat and the lean, the tall and the short; 
But somehow or other, they weren't my sort, 
All on account of Eliza. 
CHORUS: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
But somehow or other, they weren't my sortl

You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me ; 
But ah! there comes another day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses ; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me, 
The day you will not love me, 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
Ah! no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day 
you'll forget me.

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
HIMPTY DIMPTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by ail 
the Professors of Magic. 
OM", 
WW1" 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HUMPTY DIDEPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulatar, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap • 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at,home in the hand-.
