Amols.d thei managers of AffieriCa pre.ernilent for their progregg. 
Ahd energy, Tony Pastor must be classed as the most ethinent in 
that branch of amusements which go under the head of Variety. 
Indeed, he may be said to have been the inventor of that agreeable 
melange, which offers so many attractions to the spirit wearied 
merchant and mechanic of all great cities, whose minds are too 
jaded by the cares and toils of their daily life to enjoy the set 
tragedies and comedies which form the staple of what is called the 
legitimate drama. Tony Pastor has the advantage of having been 
born in the city of New York, that metropolis of the New World 
which mikes the wealth and literature of London with the dash and 
abandon of Paris. 
He has done much to bring the jaded intellect of 
the Ametican middle-classes to enjoy the dolce far itiente of amuse-
ment, which restores the tone of mind, weakened by that undue 
devotion to the mighty dollar, which is the besetting sin a 
the 
times. 
In nothing does his American nature show itself more con-
spicuottsly than in that self-reliance and go-aheaditiveness which 
have placed him at the head of his class. 
Tony was destined by 
his parents to follow his father's calling, but the unexpected death 
of his father made a change necessary. 'With admirable indepen-
dence the brave boy determined to carve out his own fortune, and 
with this end in view, embarked at the age of ten years as a 
comic 
vocalist with Raymond and Waryng's menagerie, and showing a 
peculiar talent in his line, became a 
very valuable member of the 
company, so much so that when he was only fifteen he was engaged 
as singing clown, a 
position of some importance, but which he filled 
with credit to himself, and satisfaction to his employers. Not con-
tent, however, with the liberal salary he enjoyed, his restless ambi-
tion sought for an opportunity to become his own master. 
This 
was the end he kept steadily in view from his boyhood, and he now 
finds himself at a 
comparative early age in possession of a 
great 
popularity and handsome fortune. 
Mr. Pastor's success in the 
arena as a vocalist soon brought him offers from managers, and 
his popularity became so assured, that he leased a theater in the 
Bowery, where he opened the first variety theater for ladies, where 
men could take their wives and daughters to pass an evening with-
out the chance of being called upon to blush at any allusion in the 
performance. The project at first seemed doubtful, and at one time 
ruin stared the young manager in the face; but with undaunted 
pluck he held out, and in time succeeded in inducing ladies to at-
tend, until his cozy and tasteful theatre became a popular family 
resort for the East side, which was then a much more fashionable 
place than it is at present. 
Here, upon his boards, graduated 
many who are now recognized as stars on the legitimate stage, while 
many who remained in the specialty business (a 
term invented by Mr. 
Pastor to distinguish his business from the bin en- order of varieties) 
are receiving salaries much higher than many of our Lest, actors in 
the legitimate profession. 
The innumerable incidents furnished by 
the great Civil War gave Mr. Pastor a 
wide subject for songs; and 
a 
well-known publisher contracted with him to issue his songs in a 
book form for the soldiers. 
The songs of Tony Pastor were as 
familiar with the Boys in Blue as were the songs of Tom Dibdin in 
the British navy a hundred years ago. 
Mail a brave boy has 
marched up to the enemy's guns singing the songs of Tony Pastor. 
While at the camp-fire and the picket-post they hummed his melo-
dies with thoughts far away in their distant homes, is it to be won-
dered that when peace came the soldier laddies rallied to the 
standard of he who first made popular some of the best known 
songs of the war, and the name of Tony Pastor became as a house-
hold word from the Gulf to the St. Lawrence—from Maine to 
California

ARE YOU GOING PAR? ONLY TO THE CAR. 
Copyright Secured 1;-i. 
As sung by America's own Vocalist, Tor Palma. 
Strolling out the other evening, 
Such a 
fairy girl I 
met, 
Eyes so bright with love-light gleaming, 
Her first glance I'll ne'er forget. 
Softly I 
addressed the maiden— 
In her face my fate I 
read— 
" 
Tell me, sweet one, whe're you're going," 
•` Just to meet my pa," she said. 
CHORUS. 
"Are you going far?" " Not too far, 
Only to the car just to see pa, ta-ta." 
In a 
pleasant way we chatted, 
I 
asked leave to call next day, 
She of course felt highly flattered 
To be courted in that way. 
To her ma she introduced me, 
Then my way was smooth and clear, 
There was nothing she refused me, 
When I 
whispered in her ear. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, she was very obliging; she was 
kindness itself; she would do almost anything for 
me. 
Why, one day, as we were passing Delmonico's, 
I 
asked her to come in, and, do you know, she con-
sented without a 
murmur. 
Her mother, too, is a 
real 
nice old lady. 
Whenever Blanche and I 
are going 
out for a 
walk, she will say— 
Are you going far, etc. 
But one day we met her father, 
Then there was an awful row; 
Was he angry? Well, yes, rather, 
Such a 
frown upon his brow; 
" 
Who are you, sir, with my daughter?" 
'Twas a 
voice like thunder's roar. 
"Don't you know me, sir? You'd ought to, 
I'm a 
swell called Theodore." 
SPOKEN.—It 
was quite a task to make an impres-
sion on the old gentleman, but I 
finally succeeded in 
convincing him that it was perfectly right and proper 
for Blanche and I 
to say to one another— 
Are you going far, etc.

MARY ANN, VII, TELL YOUR MA. 
Written and Composed by GEOFFREY THORN. 
Sung with great success by TONY l'ASTOR.

Bowery, 
New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
spoon a 
girl named- Mary A 
nn, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs loe lots of hall-p,mce, and a 
precious deal of love., 
, 
She's living with her mother, as a maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to know; 
FUr certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
Some heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar voice will shout— 
CFIORUS. 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your ma, 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far, 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, fie! for shame, Yah! yak! yah! Oh! yala 
We went last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail; 
I 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve its from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not bear the sun, 
Bat when we settled snugly and were just about to go 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
Oh, very well, etc. 
We wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could he, 
We thought from vulgar people there, we should at least be free, 
- 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows could hear, 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwintql, 
NN, 
bile I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
Oh, very well, etc. 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd roam, 
31y Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must know her way about, 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
A 
voice came down the staircase, and her little brother cried— 
SPoKEx.—Ohl ohl ohl 
Oh, very well, etc. 
MACY'S, FOURTEENTH STREET, SIXTH AV-
ENUE. • 
As sung by America's own Vocalist, TONY PASTOP. 
Her name is Flora, and I 
adore her, 
If you could see her so would you; 
She's up at Macy's—you all know Macy's— 
Fourteenth Street, Sixth Avenue. 
She handles lace with such a 
grace, 
She has a 
face like angel fair; 
She is so charming, ' tis quite alarming, 
The way the fellows at her stare. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am her cavalier, I 
am her pretty dear, 
She loves me fondly with a 
heart so true; 
I 
take her to the car, I'm solid with her ma, 
She's up at Macy's, Fourteenth Street, Sixth Av 
enue. 
She's so congenial, there's nOthing menial, 
She finds a 
kindred spirit here; 
I 
find the yardstick a 
very hard stick— 
Instead of wine I 
must drink beer. 
I'm on Broadway for little pay, 
And on the ladies wait all day; 
With joy I'm greeted, when I 
am seated, 
My heart to Flora flie s 
away. 
I 
am her cavalier, etc.

MACY'S, FOURTEENTH STREET, SIXTH AV— 
ENUE.

(Concluded.) 
In fancy dances, with sister Prances, 
She glides as graceful as a 
fawn; 
They all admire her, they all desire her, 
But she is mine from dusk till dawn. 
She lives on pie, she makes me sigh, 
Whenever we go out to dine; 
But I 
adore her, my pretty Flora, 
To me she seems a 
girl divine. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, my sweetheart is 
up at Macy's, 
Fourteenth Street, Sixth Avenue. 
I'm in the same 
business myself, but not at Macy's; they're all girls 
up there—they wouldn't have such a 
thing as a 
man 
around. 
Flora is such a 
sweet girl. 
She used to go 
round a great deal, but now we are more settled 
down; there was a time I 
used to think nothing of 
going out and spending two dollars all by myself in 
one night, just for beer. 
We used to go to Coney 
Island very often. 
I 
remember one day Flora got so 
sick on the boat I 
didn't know what to do, " Oh,' 
she cried, I 
want a "scuze of a lemon, just one 
scuze." 
But lemons were ten cents apiece. 
She re— 
covered, however, and the next day you could hear 
her sweet voice up at Macy's calling, " Oash here! 
Cash here! Cash! 
Cash!" 
Cfrortug. 
She wears a 
circular, all made of silk and fur, 
And on her hat a 
bunch of violets blue; 
She smokes a 
cigarette, she sings me " Olivette," 
She's up at Macy's Fourteenth street Sixth Avenue_

BLOW THE CANDLE OUT. 
BLOW THE CANDLE OUT. 
Sung with great success by TONY PAsTon. 
I've just got wedded to a 
darling wife, 
We're jolly as can be; 
There's only one thing causes strife 
On which we never agree. 
Por now and then, like the best of men, 
I 
go out in a 
jovial way, 
And as sure as fate, if I'm home late, 
I 
hear the missus say: 
SPOKEN.—" Oh! there you are at last. 
Whatever 
makes you so late? Now, do be careful with that 
candle." 
You see, my wife can't sleep with the can-
dle alight, and I 
can't sleep in the dark, so disputes 
are always arising when she says: 
Cnonus. 
Blow the candle out, John, blow the candle out, 
How late you are— you know you are, 
Now, mind what you're about, John. 
Blow the candle out. John. blow the candle out, 
Now mind you do, what I 
tell you to, 
And blow the candle out. 
When I 
get out for an hour or so, 
The time runs on so fast, 
'Tis time to go before I 
know 
The jolly night has passed. 
Up stairs I 
creep, she's fast asleep, 
I 
think I 
hear her snore, 
But, sad mistake, she's wide awake, 
And says to me once more: 
SPOKEN.—" Here's a nice time to come home to 
your wife. 
I 
can't think what sort of company you 
keep! What do you say? You won't put out the light? 
Do you expect me to get up and do it, you selfish 
man Now, John, I 
insist that you— 
Blow the candle 
4 
(Concluded.) 
At one or two—it may be three— 
I 
quit the festive scene, 
And then my Sue will say to me, 
Now tell me where you've been. 
You're home so late in such a state, 
You're not yourself I 
vow, 
How strange you talk, how queer you walk, 
You really don't know how. 
SPOKEN.—" You don't' know how to walk across 
the room, sir. 
Ah! you thought if you took off your 
boots down stairs and left them on the mat, that I 
should not know what time you got home. 
But I'm 
not such a fool as you take me for, John, though, 
goodness knows, I 
was fool enough when I 
took you. 
Now, John, I 
tell you, once for all, I will not sleep 
until you— 
Blow the candle out, etc. 
I 
often say in a 
sleepy way, 
I'm tired and feel so queer, 
That if you want the light put out, 
Do it yourself, my dear. 
But that's no use, she plays the deuce 
Whenever I'm late at night. 
Be quiet she won't, so sleep I 
don't, 
Till I've put out the light. 
SPOKEN.—She always gets the best of the argu-
ment. 
She says: " Blow it out now." 
I 
say, " I 
sha'n't! The candle be blowed." " Ali!" says she, 
"there's language to use to your wife; it's scandalous. 
I 
will not put up with it; either the candle goes out, 
or I. 
So, John, if you care for me at all, you will— 
Blow the candle out, etc. 
THE GIRL IN THE " JERSEY." 
As sung with great success by TQNY PASTOR. 
• 
There's a 
new style of dress called the " Jersey," 
Which makes all the girls look so nice, 
The stuff is much liner than kersey, 
'Tis made to attract and entice; 
On each side there's a 
nice little pocket 
Where the darlings can keep their hands warm; 
They're worn by all ladies of fashion, 
As a 
part of the new Dress Reform. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, the 
very latest thing in dress is 
the article called the " Jersey." 
When Lauretta ap-
proaches her father now, she will not say, " Pa, dear, 
I 
want a 
new sacque, or a 
cloak, or an ulster." 
Oh. 
no! Now it is, " Pa, dear, I 
want a Jersey.' 
Why, 
the other day, I 
was completely fascinated, when 1 
beheld for the first time strolling up Broadway, 
CHORUS. 
That beautiful girl in the " Jersey," 
That glorious girl in the " Jersey," 
So lovely and fair with her golden hair— 
That beautiful girl in the " Jersey." 
I've gazed upon girls of great beauty, 
The belles of the opera and ball, 
But to tell you, I 
think ' tis my duty, 
That mine is the sweetest of all. 
'Tis only of late I 
have known it; 
The charm is not all in her face, 
But comes from that new-fashioned " Jersey," 
She wears with such infinite grace. 
That beautiful girl, etc. 
Sarah Bernhardt has greatly excited 
The girls with her dresses, so grand; 
But what good are they when you're plighted 
To the one who has captured your hand? 
My advice is to dress in a " Jersey," 
And look with a 
bright roguish eye; 
You'll set all the young fellows crazy, 
And only for love will you sigh. 
SYChKEN.—Yes, I 
think all the ladies ought to wear 
" 
Jerseys," they look so well, and by-and-bye you'll 
hear somebody singing about you as 
That beautiful girl, etc.

" 
OH, 
FRED, 
DON'T BE SO FRIVOLOUS.' 
As sung with great success by Tosnr PASTOR. 
I've courted no end of young ladies, 
Sweet little roses and posies, 
Ladies with sweet, pretty faces. 
And ladies with very long noses; 
The rarest of rare, and the fairest of fair, 
When I 
ask for a sweet little kiss, 
With a 
wink of their eye, and a wink on the sly 
The answer they're giving is this, oh, my! 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Fred, don't be so frivolous, 
Oh, Fred, don't be ridiculous! 
You're not like a 
silly, you know what things are, 
I'll see you to- morrow, tra-la-la, ta-ta. 
Girls are in general quite pettish, 
Some are called miss and some missus; 
The best of them all are coquettish, 
The whole jolly lot's fond of kisses. 
1 
kiss pretty lips and I 
squeeze finger tips, 
No matter what I 
have to pay; 
If I 
meet a 
dear maid who is somewhat afraid, 
She'll blush like a 
rose and will say, oh, my! 
Oh, Fred, etc. 
I 
once knew a 
girl— such a 
sweet one— 
She never was saucy nor pert; 
She then was an innocent maiden, 
But now she's a 
saucy little flirt; 
We met Vother night, I 
was very near tight, 
Her mother was out of the way; 
I 
gave her a kiss that was brimming with bliss, 
Tho' she liked it she to me did say, oh, my! 
Oh, Fred, etc.

THE GIRLS THAT GO TO SCHOOL. 
Sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
I 
often watch the 
school-girls we meet upon the 
street, 
A-smiling like the roses red in May; 
I 
love their graceful motions, their pretty little feet, 
A-marching home on bright and pleasant days. 
All are pretty, some are witty, 
Most all of them are gay, 
A few seem sad, and I 
feel bad 
Whene'er they look that way. 
I 
love their smiling faces, they are so bright and cool, 
I 
love these laughing graces, the girls that go to 
school. 
They study French and grammar and geography too, 
And store their minds with learning that's immense, 
With ' rithmetic and Latin and notions that are new, 
And sometimes cast their eyes upon the gents. 
Rosy lasses, in their classes, 
They study hard all day, 
Happy faces, in their places, 
They pass the time away. 
I 
love their smiling faces, they are so briglit and cool, 
I 
love those smiling graces, the girls that go to school. 
They are so bright and roguish, they steal away your 
heart, 
And make you wish you were a 
Turk so gay, 
That you might buy the whole of them, and oh! 
never part, 
Till Gabri'l blows his horn on Judgment Day. 
Eyes a-glancing, so entrancing, 
Oh, as you pass them by, 
Some a 
smiling, so beguiling. 
Whene'er you meet their eye. 
I 
love their smiling faces, they are so bright and cool, 
I 
love these laughing graces, the girls that go to school. 
JUSTINE, YOU LOVE ME NOIT. 
Sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
I 
know, Justine, you speak me fair, as often as we 
met; 
And ' tis a 
luxury, I 
swear, to hear a voice so sweet; 
And yet it does not please me quite, the civil way 
you've got; 
For me you're something too polite—Justine, you love 
me not! 
know, Justine, you never scold at naught that I 
may do: 
If I 
am passionate, or cold, 
' 
A charming temper," say 
husband's lot: 
I 
wish ' twere ruffled now and 
me not! 
'tis all the same to you. 
the men, to smooth a 
then—Justine, you love 
I 
know, Justine, you wear a 
smile as beaming as the 
sun; 
But who supposes all the while it shines for only one? 
Though azure skies are fair to see, a 
transient cloudy 
spot 
In yours would promise more to me—Justine, you 
love me not! 
I 
know, Justine. you make my name your eulogistic 
theme, 
And say—if any chance to blame—you hold me in 
esteem. 
Such words, for all their kindly scope, delight me not 
a 
jot; 
just so you would have praised the Pope— Justine, 
you love me not! 
know, Justine—for I have heard what friendly 
voices tell— 
You do not blush to say the words, " You like me 
passing well ;" 
And thus the fatal sound I 
hear that seals my lonely 
lot, 
There's nothing now to hope or - fear—Justine, you. 
love me not!

Who kissed those lips when I

The parson visits there; 
I 
can't see why, upon my life, 
Each day, though foul or fair.

Or comfort to her soul he brings,

To shut the playl_ouse doors;

That wicked actors cause. 
Though black sheep dwell in every flock, 
How many parsons swell 
The ranks of Scandal every year? 
That's more than I

OH, 
THOSE COW HIDE SLIPPERS! 
Written and sung by TONY PAsTort_ 
A 
tale of love I 
now will tell 
Of a 
charming maid I 
loved so well, 
Her name was Blue-eyed, Laughing Nell, 
A 
most bewitching girl. 
'Twas at a 
ball we chanced to meet, 
I 
never met a 
girl so sweet, 
She seemed a 
fairy, dressed so neat, 
My brain was in a 
whirl.-
SPOKEN. 
'twas at a 
ball I 
first met her, and, 
as she gracefully waltzed round the room, I 
felt I 
had lost my heart, and as she came sailing past me, 
I 
discovered she had on her little footsey wootsey's— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, such lovely slippers, 
Like to water dippers, 
Red rosettes, high French heels 
And fancy little bows. 
Oh! those darling slippers, 
Oh, those daisy trippers, 
Trimmed with gold, double-soled, 
And pointed at the toes. 
We met again one rainy day, 
The walks all wet and muddy lay, 
With cautious step she picked her way, 
And crossed the crowded street. 
17 
OH, 
THOSE COWHIDE SLIPPERS ! 
(Concluded.) 
I 
watched her proud and lofty stride, 
With two policemen at her side, 
Who helped her reach the other side, 
Policemen on the beat. 
SPOIKEN.—Old and young women. (Gag about 
policemen). 
Oh, such lovely slippers, etc. 
Again we met as lovers may, 
I 
begged her name the wedding day, 
She blushed and fainted quite away, 
Just then I 
heard a 
roar— 
Her angry father raised his foot, 
He wore a 
number eleven boot, 
And through the air he let it scoot, 
And bounced me from his door. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! those cowhide slippers, 
Ohl those tan-yard nippers, 
Crashing! smashing! through the air, 
Tearing all my clothes— 
No more golden slippers, 
No more cowhide flippers, 
Copper- lined, iron bound, 
And loaded to the toes.

PLEASE DON'T.. 
Sung with great success by TONT PASTOR. 
My name is Dick, I'm called a 
brick— 
At least by all my chums; 
I 
never rate at unkind pate, 
But take it as it comes. 
A pretty maid has made a 
raid 
On this poor heart of mine, 
But ' tis her way these words to say, 
When to kiss her I 
am trying: 
CHORUS. 
Now, Dick, do be quiet, now don't, please don't, 
I 
cannot, I 
will not, I 
sha'n't and I 
won't; 
Oh, please, don't squeeze, for, as you perceive, 
You really are vexing, now don't, please don't. 
She is so shy, I 
know not why, 
Unlike most of her sex; 
There are but few so hard to woo. 
A 
saint sometimes she'd vex, 
With eyes so meek and dimpled cheek, 
By all ye gods above, 
I 
sometimes think I'm on the brink 
Of going mad with love. 
SPOKEN. — And yet, when I 
would fain sip some of 
the sweetness from those honeyed lips, she whispers: 
Now, Dick, do be quiet, etc. 
I've asked her twice to be my wife, 
But she shakes her pretty head; 
If she'd relent and give consent 
Next week we should be wed. 
I 
cannot see why she should be 
So bashful in her way, 
When ill at ease, down on my knees, 
This is all she e'er will say :— CHoRus. 
But desperate beings use desperate means 
To gain their selfish ends; 
Elate with hope I 
will elope, 
Aided by a 
trusty friend. 
Then shortly we will married be, 
Come quickly, happy day, 
And I'll go bail she'll change her tale 
From what she used to say. —CHORUS.

AN IRISHMAN'S TOAST. 
A.s sung with great success by TONY PASTOR.. 
Don't call me weak-minded, perchance I 
should sing 
Of the dearest old spot upon earth, 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring 
To iny mind the dear land of my birth, 
With its hills and its valleys, its mountains and vales 
Of which our forefathers would boast, 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ali, but list' and Fit give you an Irishman's toast. 
CHORUS. 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen, 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam 
Through the castle that stood on the bill; 
But the stout hand of time has desitroved the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air. 
Here's to the land, etc. 
The church and the schoolhouse have long been 
replaced; 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host, 
The white-haired old veteran has long been at rest, 
And his wife has deserted her post ; 
King Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er the seas, 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot, 
Still this toast seems to waft to my 
ears on the breeze. 
Here's to the land, etc.

NEVER AGAIN. 
Sung with great success by TOITY PASTOR. 
How often we hear old fogies declare 
If they could live over again, 
They'd never get wed, or caught in a snare, 
But play quite a 
different game; 
It's all very well for people to talk 
Of things in this world they would do, 
But start them again, you'd find they would walk 
The same path of life they've gone through. 
SPOKEN. — Look at the married man after his day's 
toil. 
He rushes home to his family and his evening 
meal, which is accompanied by the baby screaming 
the roof off. 
He says, ' What an idot a 
man must be 
to marry! 
The wife says, " If I 
were to die to- mor-
row, you'd get married in a month." To which he 
replies: 
CHORUS. 
Never again, love, never again, 
Smiles are bewitching and women are vain; 
Husbands are soft that never complain, 
You've had me this time, love, but never again. 
How awful bewitching the old woman is 
Whenever she wants a 
new dress: 
She'll ask her sweet babe to kiss his papa. 
And puts on a 
smile of the hest.

[(Concluded.) 
The husband, poor lamb, is dragg'd to a 
shop, 
To see how much money she'll waste, 
And when he is there, of course he must stop, 
Because he has got such a

SPOKEN. — Poor 
devil! 
the wife 
orders twenty 
yards of silk at three dollars a 
yard. 
The old boy 
goes home, singing— 
Never again, love, etc. 
Sweet honeymoons and connubial bliss 
Are all very nice, I 
dare say: 
But some married couples are always amiss, 
They're fighting and rowing all day; 
The wife says, " I'm sure I'll go home to ma, 
And thus from a 
brute I'll remain," 
But when she starts out, she finds it's too far, 
And turns to her dear home again. 
SPOKEN. — And layi-ag her head artfully on his 
shoulder, says, " James, dear, you won't tell me to 
boil my face in the fish-kettle again, will you, dar-
ling?" 
He, in an instant, says— 
Never again. etc.

And pass an hour or so, 
But I

With " little brother Joe."

He sits upon the sofa, he ,iunipl friround the floor; 
He views the situation Ulm' the keyhole of the door. 
He talks to his companions of his big sister's beau; 
A 
plagtie upon humanity is " little brother Joe." 
Now, ofteP, when I 
sit and sigh, 
And almost pop the question. 
In conies the thoughtless little boy 
And offers sonic suggestion. 
I 
bribe him up with sugar plums, 
And try to make him go, 
But nothing seems to have effect 
On " little brother Joe." 
He likes to climb upon my knee; 
And at my side he lingers; 
lie pulls me by the collar, 
With his little taffy fingers. 
Sometimes I'd like to warm him, 
But Louisa whispers, " No, 
Don't mind his playful manner, 
He's my little brother Joe." 
For six long months it has been thus; 
I've tried to win Louisa, 
But I 
have had no chance at all— 
Not even to hug or squeeze her. 
Of course, you know the fault's not mine, 
A fellow has no show 
When people will intrude themselves 
Like " little brother Joe."

LAUGH AND YOU'LL NEVER FEEL OLD. 
Am.—No Luck About the .House. 
Sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
Good-evening, folks, I'm here once more, 
A 
little song to try, 
No doubt you've seen me here before, 
And ere I 
say good-bye, 
Some good advice I 
mean to give, 
Which would be cheap, if sold, 
That is simply this, as long as you live, 
Why, laugh, and you'll never feel old. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, laugh ha-ha-ha, ho-ho-ho, 
You'll find it better by far, 
To laugh at all care as through life you go, 
Fal-der-der-dal, da-da. 
I'm a 
pretty old age, no doubt you see, 
But. hearty as a 
roe, 
From gout and the like I 
still am free 
Although I'm eighty-two; 
When I 
was sixty— long years past— 
I 
by my friends was told, 
I 
down the hill was traveling fast— 
But I 
laughed for I 
didn't feel old. 
When seventy-two I 
reached, they said 
I 
ought to make my will, 
Long years were ripening on my head, 
But I 
felt quite hearty still, 
They thought that soon they'd have my cash, 
But nicely, they were sold, 
For I 
told them they were talking trash, 
And I 
laughed, for I 
didn't feel old. 
Ten years since then have passed away, 
But they cannot make me fret, 
And if I 
laugh on and am always gay, 
I 
shall reach a 
hundred yet. 
Then never despair at your whitening hair, 
When by your friends you're told, 
That to the grave you are drawing near, 
But laugh and you'll never feel old.

With love-light that night on the banks of the Lee?

For months we've been parted, but no loving letter

My heart full of sadness, would pulsate with gladness, 
Could I

Or else study natural history, as shown 
In the sweet monkey house at the " Zoo." 
To Brown and his wife, and their large troop of kids,

As sung by America's own Vocalist, TONT PASTOR. 
I 
am a 
dreadful character, in vice I 
go the pace, 
I'll give a 
start to any man and win an easy race; 
I've galloped helter-skelter through the catalogue of 
crimes, 
Committed theft and perjury at least a 
dozen times. 
I've had my fling at forgery, at felony and fraud, 
And when I 
go marauding, you can bet I 
do maraud ; 
But I 
never condescended, though of crime I've made 
a 
tour, 
To the greatest crime in Christendom—the crime of 
being poor. 
Cuouus. 
And that's how I 
keep from detection; 
if you'll give it a 
moment's reflection 
You all will agree 
In this precept with me, 
That's it awfully wrong to be poor. 
For the rich oft may sin, 
While the poor get run in, 
Oh, it's awfully wrong to be poor. 
I've been a bank director, and the bank it went to 
smash, 
For we'd played at speculation with a lot of poor 
folk's cash; 
I've got up little swindles in the shape of silver mines, 
And sold the juice of cabbage stalks as port and sherry 
win es. 
THE BOLD BAD MAN. 
(Coiteluded.) 
l've manufactured butter out of railway grease 
fat, 
But I 
go to church on Sundays, and I 
always smell 
my hat; 
My balance at my banker's makes my dodges safe

The safest sort of roguery is to rob and cheat the 
poor. 
CHORUS. 
And that's how I 
keep from detection; 
If you give it a 
moment's reflection 
You all will agree 
In this precept with me, 
That's it's safest to swindle the poor. 
For the rich make a 
row, 
But the poor folks we cow, 
So it's safest to swindle the poor. 
If my 
little game were murder, still I'd keep my maw-
leys clean.; 
could bribe my poorer brothers— monarchs do the 
same, I 
ween; 
When their neighbor's land kings covet, what's about 
the price they pay? 
Don't they send men out to rob him, at a 
bob a 
head 
a 
day? 
Bother guilt upon your conscience!—if you've gold 
inside your purse, 
You can be as bad as I 
am, and, in fact, a 
little worse. 
Wealth can make the wicked honored, and give 
beauty to the boor, 
But you mustn't be a villain if you happen to be 
or.

SAID THE POT TO THE KETTLE. 
Sung with great success by To 
Pssrou. 
You have heard of the pot and the kettje, 
How each called the other one black, 
Though both were so sooty, of grace and of beauty 
Each thought that it nothing did lack. 
When the light was put out in the kitchen, 
And all the good folks were in bed, 
The pot and the kettle were put on their mettle, 
And these are some things that they said: 
Said the pot: " There's a 
new style of bonnet 
That looks like the side of a 
hill; 
Behind one ' tis certain you can't see the curtain 
When ladies the theatre fill." 
Said the kettle: " You men are not perfect, 
4 
For after each act you sneak out 
For sherry and bitters, and leave us poor 'critters' 
For sale, while for cocktails you shout!" 
Said the kettle: " They make big collections 
In churches each Sunday, I 
hear; 
While poor folks are sighing, in wretchedness dying, 
Now, where these stamps go, it is queer." 
Said the pot: " They are sent to the heathen 
To purchase them toothpicks and eake; 
And the well-preserved preachers, can't see the poor 
creatures 
That through our streets shiver and shaker 
Said the pot: " Now the mistress is wearing 
That wonderful thing called a ' bang;' 
The girls in the kitchen, all look quite bewitching, 
For wearing it they've got the hang." 
Said the kettle: " You're right, 'twas but lately 
I 
heard of an accident rash— 
At table, a 
boarder created disorder 
By finding a ' bang a in his hash!" 
35 
SAID THE POT TO THE KETTLE. 
(Concluded.) 
Said the kettle: " Some clubs where a 
lady 
May lounge in, the same as a 
swell, 
Are getting in use, now, what's tb1111:30 for the goose, 
now, 
Is sause for the gander as well.'" 
Said the pot: " Who will now nurse the babies 
If women to clubs off will roam? 
Now, with my best respects for the delicate sex, 
A 
woman's best club is her home." 
Said the pot: " Noodle Snooks met a 
widow, 
'Twas at a 
grand ball of the 
ton;' 
Her bust was perfection, likewise her complexion, 
A 
bushel of gems she had on!" 
Said the kettle: " I 
heard that her figure 
And diamonds were ' snide,' nothing real. 
She snatched Snooks bald-headed, and now they are 
wedded, 
She looks like the ghost of an eel!" 
Said the kettle: " In Central Park lately 
The sport was delightfully line, 
While lovers were skating. the ice they were breaking, 
And spooned in a 
manner divine!" 
Said the pot: " It's no wonder the ladies 
Don't scream, now, whenever they fall, 
That new patent bustle— it don't even rustle—

SOMETIMES I 
DO, SOMETIMES I 
DON'T. 
As sung by America's own Vocalist, TONY PASTOR. 
I'm a 
young fellow, that you can see, 
I 
know a 
lady that's spooney on me; 
She calls me Georgy, I 
call her Ruth, 
She's all perfection, beauty and truth; 
Still she annoys me, I 
don't know why. 
When I 
am happy, she pipes her eye; 
If I'm in trouble, Ruth then will laugh, 
When I'm in earnest, Ruth then will chaff. 
SPOKEN. —Ruth is a strange creature; the other 
day I 
attempted to steal a 
kiss; Ruth said, " Behave 
yourself;" I said, " When we are married you will 
give me permission to take as many as I 
like." Ruth 
said 
CHORUS. 
Sometimes I 
shall, George, sometimes I 
sha'n't; 
Sometimes you can, George, sometimes you can't; 
Sometimes I 
will, George, sometimes I 
won't; 
Sometimes I 
do, George, and sometimes I 
don't. 
Ruth's '
Only eighteen, I 
more than eight; 
Still kr her fortune I'm going to wait. 
'Tis not her riches, Ruth is a 
pearl 
Fit for a 
monarch, I 
love the girl. 
Though for the present Ruth has her way, 
Wait a 
while, darling, I'll have my say: 
Wait till I'm married and settled for life, 
Handle the rhino, and Ruth is my wife, 
37 
SOMETIMES I 
DO, SOMETIMES I 
DON'T. 
(Concluded.) 
SPOKEN. — Yes, I must wait. 
Last night I said, 
"Ruthy, we'll stay at home and play double-dummy ;" 
she said, " No, we'll go out;" I 
said, " All right, dear, 
let's go and see Booth ;" Ruth said, " No;" I 
said, 
" 
Let's go and see the Zulus;" Ruth said, " No, I 
don't like the Zulus; they eat the missionaries up ;" 
I 
said, " Let's go to a missionary meeting;" Ruth 
said, " I 
don't like the missicnaries; they disturb the 
poor Zulus." 
I 
said, " When I'm married you'll let 
me go and see my old pals, won't you?" Ruth said— 
Sometimes I 
shall, etc. 
Ruth has a 
guardian, ugly and grim, 
He don't like me, I 
detest him ; 
He keeps his eye on the money, you know, 
I'll trick him yet as the older I 
grow. 
There's only one in it, I'm number one, 
I'm the top-s 
awyer, till the deed's done, 
None has a 
look in, except this young youth; 
You can all back me this time, I've landed Ruth. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, that fossil of a guardian is an old 
snoozer, and wouldn't mind paying two lunatic 
doctors a trifle to put me in a madhouse that he 
could marry the girl himself. 
But the day's fixed, 
and I 
asked if she would like my mother to live with 
us for housekeeper; and I 
said I 
had a 
cousin, a 
very 
nice person. " Oh, let him come!" said Ruth. 
I 
said, " My dear, it's not a him cousin, but a her 
cousin—a 
female cousin; you'll let her come for a 
week or two?" To which Ruth replied— 
Sometimes I 
shall. et

AIR.—" King of the Cannibal Islands." 
Oh! what a 
jolly crowd was there 
The lean, the fat, the braye, the fair: 
No other frolic can compare 
With the Inauguration Party! 
The ladies—oh: the pretty dears! 
With diamonds dangling at their ears; 
And bangs that sprouted o'er their nose, 
And puffs and curls and furbelows( 
John Kelly entered, arm in arm 
With ex- Mayor Cooper, proud and calm; 
Their jigs and breakdowns were the charm 
Of the Inauguration Party! 
Then Grant, behind a 
bad cigar, 
With smiles as bright as any stay, 
Stood hugging Dana at the bar 
Of the Inauguration Party! 
And Sprague, with shot-gun at his side. 
Waltzed by with Conkling, true and tried, 
And Beecher took a 
champagne lunch, 
And drank no more cold- water punch! 
Ben Butler went one eye on Blain, 
Johnny Davenport near went insane, 
And Comstock kissed George Francis Train 
At the Inauguration Party!

Spinola, with his collar, clean, 
Near Gallant Hancock next was seen, 
Who winked at Garfield, all serene, 
At the Inauguration Party. 
Jay Gould and Vanderbilt then met 
And both " took stock " in every set; 
And Tahnage, and Miss Bernhardt, too, 
Shook hands above an oyster stew! 
Joe English cut a 
pigeon wing, 
And Arthur comic songs did sing, 
And Tilden danced a 
Highland fling 
At the Inauguration Party! 
Now, Uncle Sam. he paid the bill, 
And champagne vanished with a 
will, 
Enough was drank to turn a 
mill, 
At the Inauguration Party! 
The last I 
saw, the aldermen 
Hugged Kelly there, with might and main, 
And not a 
word of " boodle " spoke, 
And said the past was all a 
joke! 
Then Lightning Charley had an eye 
On Butler, who was sitting by, 
Lest with the spoons he'd try to fly, 
At the Inauguration Party!

OH, FRED! TELL THEM TO STOP. 
As sung by Com. BCRGESS. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well. I 
thought for amusement I'd take my 
girl there 
To pass a 
dull hour away. 
We went in you must know and saw Barnum's Great 
Show, 
Van Amburgh's Menageri-) as well; 
There were roundabouts, swings and all kind of 
things, 
Forget the day I 
never shah. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, when we go*. to the fair my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride on one or the swings. 
I said: 
"All right, my darling," and we had a swing; but 
directly the swing went to and iro, ete lustily called 
out: 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Fred! tell them to stop! 
That was the cry of Maria; 
But the more she said whoa! "
tidy 'fnid let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little 1,:i; higher. 
The people that stood round, of course they all laughed 
But J 
only said stop the swing; 
There were 'four or five others in the boats beskle us, 
Saying, master, don't do such a 
thing. 
'Twas then that some roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knee, 
And one of them said, the young man's turniag red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
Oh, Prt,d1 ti4 
They soon stopped the swing and Maria got out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
This girl wholn I 
now do adore. 
Should you ever go there to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing, 
Of the great roundabout, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing.

loved you with passion, how you were my

If you was a

Would you say no? Ah, my poor heart beats sot 
Would you say yes? Ali, confess:, all, confess!

No, no, no, or yes, yes, yes.

When a

Or maturing his felonious little plans, little plans, 
His capacity for innocent enjoyment, 'joyment,

A policeman's lot is not a happy one. 
Cnonns. 
When constabulary duty's to be done, to be done, 
A policeman's lot is not a 
happy one. 
When the enterprising burglar's not a-burgling, not 
a-burgling, 
When the cut-throat isn't occupied in crime, 'pied in 
crime, 
He loves to hear the little brook a-gurgling, brook 
a-gurgling, 
And listen to the merry village chime, village chime. 
When the coster's finished jumping on his mother, on 
his mother, 
He loves to lie a-basking in the sun, in the sun, 
Oh, take one consideration with another,

A policeman's lot is not a

Music and Words of " Pirates of Penzance " Full -Opera can be had 
of OLIVER DITSON 8,7. Co., Boston, Mass. 
RUTH. 
When Frederick was a 
little lad 
He proved so brave and daring, 
His father thought he'd ' prentice him 
To some career sea- faring. 
I 
was, alas! his nurs'ry maid 
And so it fell to my lot, 
To take and bind the promising boy 
Apprentice to a 
pilot. 
CHORUS. 
A 
life not bad for a 
hardy lad, 
Though surely not a 
high lot, 
Though I'm a 
nurse, you might do worse, 
Than make your boy a pilot. 
I 
was a 
stupid nurs'ry maid, 
On breakers always steering; 
And I 
did riot catch the word aright, 
• 
Through being hard of hearing. 
Mistaking my instructions; which 
Within my brain did gyrate, 
I 
took and bound this promising boy 
Apprentice to a pirate. 
CHORUS. 
A 
sad mistake it was to make, 
And doom him to a 
vile lot 
I 
bound him to a 
pirate—you— 
Instead of to a 
pilot.

But I

And break it to my master. 
A 
nurs'ry maid is not afraid 
Of what you people ea7l work;-  
So I 
made up my mind to go as a 
kind 
Of. piratical maid-of-all-work. 
CHORUS. 
And that is how you find me now 
A member of your shy lot, 
\:Which you wouldn't have found had he been bound

.‘ MODERN MAJOR-GENERAL. 
Music and Words of " Pirates of Penzance" Full Opera can be had 
of ()us-En DITSON 43: Co., Boston, Mass. 
MAJOR—GENERAL STANLEY. 
I 
am the very pattern of a 
model major-general, 
I've information animal, vegetable and mineral; 
I 
know the kings of England, and I 
quote the fights 
historical, 
From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical. 
Pm very well acquainted, too, with matters mathe-
matical ; 
I 
understand equations, both the simple and quad-
ratical ; 
About binominal theorem l'm teeming with a 
lot o' 
news, 
With many cheerful facts about the square of the 
hypothenuse. 
CHORUS. 
I'm very good at integral and differential calculus, 
I 
know the scientific names of beings animalculous; 
In short, in matters vegetable, animal and mineral, 
I 
am the very model of a 
modern major-general. 
I 
know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir 
Carodoc's, 
answer hard acrostics, I've a 
pretty taste for para-
dox; 
I 
quote, in Elegiacs, all the crimes of Heliogabalus, 
In conics I 
can floor peculiarities parabolous. 
I 
can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and 
Zoffanies, 
I 
know the croaking chorus from the " Frogs of Aris-
tophanes." 
Then I 
can 1111111 a fugue, of which I've heard the 
music's din afore 
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense 
" 
Pinafore." 
59 
A MODERN MAJOR-GENERAL. 
(Concluded.) 
CHORUS. 
Then I 
can write a 
washing- bill in Babylonic canci-
form, 
And tell you ev'ry detail of Caractacus's uniform; 
In short in matters vegetable, animal and mineral, 
I 
am the very model of a 
modern major-general. 
In fact, when I 
know what is meant by " mamelon " 
and " ravelin,'' 
When I 
can tell at sight a Chassepotritle from a 
javelin; 
When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more 
wary at, 
And when I 
know precisely what is meant by com 
missariat, 
When I 
have learnt what progress is made in modern 
gunnery; 
When I 
know more of tactics than a novice in a 
I've a smattering of elemental strat-
egy— 
You'll
short
  
say a 
better general has never sat a 
yet. 
Cnont -s. 
For my military knowledge, filo' 
I'm 
plucky and 
adventury; 
Has only been brought down to tile beginning of the 
century, 
But still in matters vegetable. animal and mineral, 
I 
am the very model of a 
modern major-general.

MARY'S GONE -milt A COON. 
Copyright, 1880, by GEO. D. 
NEWHALL & Co. 
Dar's heaps of trouble on de old man's mind— 
Come, darkies, weep wid me, 
My Mary Ann's run away wid a 
coon, 
And lie's black, he's black as he can be. 
But I 
wouldn't care if he was only yellow, 
But he's black all o'er; he's porter in a 
store, 
And my heart it is tore, when I 
think the matter o'er, 
Dat de child dat I 
bore, should think of me no more, 
Dan to run away wid a 
great black coon. 
CHORUS. 
Mary's gone wid it coon; 
Mary's gone wid a 
coon; 
Heaps of trouble cn de old man's mind, 
Since Mary's gone wid a 
coon. 
Oh! I 
never thought, when I 
raised dat 
Of de trouble she would be to me; 
She had everything dat her heart could wish, 
She was raised in the lap of luxury; 
And I 
never once for a 
moment suspected 
But dat she'd reflected, before she selected 
A man more respected, more highly connected, 
Less darkly complected, and not have dejected, 
Dis old man's mind with trouble like dis. 
Mary's gone, etc. 
Now all you people who have children to raise, 
Take warning at my fate; 
Watch over dem carefully, or else you'll find, 
Like me, dat you have been too late, 
For girls are wild when dey're in deir teens; 
Dey're always after beaux, and wearing good clothes 
And going to shows, and no one knows, 
All de troubles and woes, from a 
parent's heart 
flows— 
It's enough to break dis old man's heart. 
Mary's gone, eft. ;
