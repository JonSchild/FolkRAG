war, do you —
Luis Calderon: Sure, sure I believe it's right —
John Henry Faulk: You think Mr. Roosevelt should have declared war on them?
Luis Calderon: Mm, hmm [affirmative]. Because, the United States is the only country been stayed
out of war. We've been holding out of war long enough now. They tried jumping on him like they was
somebody coming to my house and tried jumping me, I have to do something. I have to defend my

Sam, has got a right to go right away and don't give no time, don't give them no more chances.

too. And we had like twelve or countries that's going to help the United States and I believe we whip
that —
John Henry Faulk: What do you think about Mexico helping the United States out, do you think that's
—
Luis Calderon: ??? help is right. It was right to help because they've been here as neighbors and they
get along all right. All the Mexicans been treated right in here the United States and I believe Mexico
was right to help them.

John Henry Faulk: What do you reckon about the Japanese? Why do you suppose they started this
war with the United States?
Luis Calderon: Well, you know they started war because they, I believe, they try keeping the United
States to helping Brits and Russia. That's what I — I ???. So they's keeping busy in here, don't take no
ammunition. No help over there. And give a chance to Germany to whip Russia.
John Henry Faulk: Do you think Germany got Japan into the war?
Luis Calderon: Well, that's what I thought. I believe it push them in so it helped them.

John Henry Faulk: Well, let me ask you something. You said you wanted, you think we ought to whip
Japan. Why? What's the matter with Japan?
Luis Calderon: Well, they didn't have a right to jump on that Philippines —
John Henry Faulk: ???
Luis Calderon: — and Hawaii and now he kill so many American citizens. They didn't have the right to
do that.
John Henry Faulk: Well, did you expect them to go, did you think that they were going to start a fight?
Luis Calderon: Yeah.
John Henry Faulk: You were, you were expecting that all along?
Luis Calderon: Sure.
John Henry Faulk: How'd you know?
Luis Calderon: Well, I've been hearing everybody say — what do you call them, Congress, they say
declared war and I believe they're right to do that.
John Henry Faulk: Well, let me ask you, Mr. Calderon, what about the people that you work with, the
people that you know, goes to your church, the other Mexicans, of those people that at least were
born in Mexico. I guess many of them are citizens the United States now, but they speak Spanish.
What do you think about them? How do they feel about it?
Luis Calderon: Well all of the other Mexicans, they're all my friends and they say they are ready to
go and help the United States and serve this cause. ??? I was born in Mexico myself too, but I raised
my kids and I have to fight for my country with my kids. I know Mexico is my country, but I left my
country and as long as I've been living here and they've been treating me good. I'm an American
citizen now and I just call this my country. And I'm just ready to fight, we had some talk with some of
my friends and they said we had no rights. I told them Mexico is in already too, if we got to Mexico
we'd have to go. And as long as we are living here, we are are ready to go too.
John Henry Faulk: That's what I think about it. Mexican people in the United States the way I think
they feel. They don't love Japan too much.

with Mexico and Hitler is going to come to the United States, but Mexico don't let him.
John Henry Faulk: No.
Luis Calderon: They try pretty good a while, but three or four, more than ten years I believe, they told
Mexico anytime you want to get these four states, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California used
to belong to Mexico. And Japan try to put Mexico, and tell them they'd help anytime they wanted to
—
John Henry Faulk: Get those states back.

and I asked them, “How do you feel?” They said, “Well I believe I'm going to quit school and go to the
war too. I'd like to go.” About four or five they're going to quit school and go register for army. [sound
