CAFE TEXAN HUNTSVILLE'S NEWEST HUNTSVILLE, TEXAS May 16, 1939
John A. Lomax Merryville, La.
Dear Sir:
I had the express man to pick up the package you left here with me and I am sending you
the receipt that he gave me for the package. The express man said you had c.o.d. on
the package and he said that you meant for them to collect $500 before they deliver the
package.
But he told me to write you and tell you if that is not what you meant for them to do, that
you can wire the express agent in Washington, D. C. and the express agent there will
release the package without collecting the $500.
Yours truly, Cafe Texan
Dear Spivacke:
This ought to get you the records. If it won't, let me know at Parchman, Miss. The Express
man misunderstood my caption.
Yours, John A. Lomax
