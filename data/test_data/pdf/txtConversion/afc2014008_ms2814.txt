And y

All t

t
er o
r f
or worse t
hat i
s what I
 must b
e, b
ecause my world
 
c
enters i
n t
he Southwest  and i

away. I
 f
ind i
n i
t enough material t
o d
elight and i
nspire me
 
not f
or one l
ifetime but f
or s
everal. So t
he project i
n Lubbock
 
was i

t was only a s
tone's t
hrow f
rom where I
 was
 
r
aised and a
 part o
f my own environment. I
t i
s
 t

ob
 
I
 have e
ver had; however, s
ize i
n i
tself means l
i
ttle. But i
n i
t
 
I
 b
elieve I
 have kept t
he s
tandard a
s h
igh a
s i
n any o

mural I
 have e
ver done.
 
Anyone f
amiliar with f
resco t
echniques knows t
hat you
 
paint i
n f
everish haste and with t
errif
ic c
oncentration. You
 
s
train yourself and a
ll your r
esources during t

f
 
availability o
f t
he p
laster. T
ime s
l
ips away, t
he p

and c

re d
if
f
icult. Unless t
he a
rea i
s c
ompletely
 
s
craped away and r
edone, only minor r
etouching i
s possible.
 
Knowing t
his t
he painter must f
eel absolute d
edication t
o,
 
and passion f
or, h
is t
ask while t
he paster i
s wet.
 
This l
imitation, o
ccasioned by t
he b
ehavior o
f t
he p
laster,
 
i
s t
he advantage and t
he c
hallenge o
f f
resco. The e
xecution
 
must be swift and s
ure. The p
reparation r
equires a
 g
reat d

o
f s
chooling, a vast amount o
f p
re-thought, and e
xtensive
 
c
onsideration o
f t
he problems p
resented by t
he walls. I
 s
pent
 
f
our y
ears on t
he Lubbock mural. Only s
ixteen weeks was I
 
a
ctually painting -
 an average o
f one panel a
 week -
 but
 
untold, uncounted hours were s
pent t
hinking about i
t
, c
on-
s
idering t
he d
ecorative problems, d
esign, a
rrangement, and
 
h
istorical background. Then t
here was t
he matter o
f s
elec-
t
ion, what t
o i
nclude and what t
o e
l
iminate, because i
f we
 
i
ncluded e
verything o
f i
nterest t
he painting would b
egin t
o
 
l
ook l
ike a
 mail o
rder c
atalogue. There would have b
een no
 
d
esign, no r
hythm, no pattern. I
t would have been a
 hodge-
podge o
f many f
ascinating t
hings. We had t
o e
liminate, but
 
we d
id i
nclude s
uch t
hings a
s horses, windmills, buggies.
 
wagons, c
laim s
hacks, e
arly c
hurches, s
chool houses, c
hil-
d
ren, c
owboys, f
reighters, f
armers and r
ange p
lants.

I
 have a
lways b
een f
ascinated by our Southwestern botany
 
and by Nature's adaptability o
f i
t
. Nature has made h
er
 
p
lants f
i
t our d
if
f
icult environment and our c
ountry has b
e-
c
ome her proving ground, where s
he c
onstantly e
xperiments
 
with p
lant l
ife. So we have i
ncluded s
ome o
f our characteris-
t
ic p
lants, s
uch a
s t
he mesquite and t
he c
ottonwood, a
s well
 
a
s smaller p
lants.
 
One o
f t
he problems o
f t
his p
roject was t
o a
rrange t
he
 
f
igures over t
he doorways, b
ecause e
ach o
f t
hese panels i
s
 
a
lloted t
o a
 c
ertain person. So up over t
he f
our doorways we
 
had t
o p
lace t
hese f
igures and prevent t
hem f
rom appearing
 
about t
o f
all of
f o
r e
ven bothered with t
he p
recariousness o
f
 
t
heir position. We have a
 doctor with a
 horse and buggy, a
 
l
awyer, an e
ditor and a s
chool master, a
ll above doorways.
 
So we i
ntroduced balconies and mesas i
nto t
he d
esign. Then
 
we had t
o i
ncorporate t
he l
ouvres o
f t
he heat ducts i
nto t
he
 
pattern. All o
f t
hese t
hings and many o
thers made up t
he
 
p
roblems o
f t
he mural.
 
The mural has i
ts own p
erspective, a
 s
ort o
f n
ever-never
 
l
and o
f perspective and o
f l
ife. I
t s
hould b
e v
iewed with
 
s
omewhat t
he s
ame f

t s

ecause we have
 
c

aws o

ried t
o adapt our pattern, our
 
t
houghts and our i
