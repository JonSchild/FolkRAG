Love's ImpossibilityAs I was a-walking in yonder green field(Savory, sage, rosemary, and thyme)[,?]
[md] Remember me unto yonder young maidAnd she shall be a true lover of mine.Go tell her to
make me a cambric shirt(Savory, sage, rosemary, and thyme), [md] With neither seam nor needle
work,And then she shall be a true lover of mine.Go tell her to wash it in yonder well(Savory, sage,
rosemary, and thyme), [md] Where water never ran nor rain never fell,And then she shall be a true
lover of mine.Go tell her to hang it on yonder thorn bush(Savory, sage, rosemary, and thyme), [md]
Where leaf never grew since I was bornAnd than she shall be a true lover of mine.As I was walking
in yonder green field(Savory, sage, rosemary, and thyme), [md] Remember me to yonder young
man,And then he shall be a true [loverrof?] mine.Go tell him to buy me an acre of land,(Savory,
sage, rosemary, and thyme), [md] Between the salt seas and in the sea sand,And then he shall be
a true lover of mind.Go tell him to sow it in popper and corn(Savory, sage, rosemary, and thyme),
[md] And to plow it all in with an old ram's horn,And then he shall be a true lover of mine.Go tell
him to reap it with sickle of leather(Savory, sage, rosemary, and thyme), [md] And to sweep it all up
with a peafawl's feather,And then he shall be a true lover of mine.Go tell him after he's done all his
work(Savory, sage, rosemary, and thyme), [md] To come unto me for his cambric shirt,And then he
shall be a true lover of mine.
