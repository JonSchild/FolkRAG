Description of boundaries; EJ's grandfather owned about 
500 acres; present farm is 84 acres 
EJ doesn’t know when Ira J. (EJ’s grandfather7 came 
to this land. Ownership of the land now split 
among EJ and two sisters 
Early crops: buckwheat, rye, oats, corn, potatoes. 
No barley. 
Grain crops were raised for feed; grain threshed with 
flails. 
Tape recorder handed to Richard McCamant 
We walk towards the house 
The garden, and vegetables grown there: tomatoes, 
potatoes, beans, cucumbers, squash, radishes 
EJ just raised 55 bushels of potatoes, which will be 
sold, given away, divided with neighbors, and 
eaten in large quantities 
Storing potatoes 
Potatoes raised on the farm as long as EJ can remember. 
Kemper Jarvis (EJ’s father) sold potatoes to 
Galax restaurants for $l/bushel. 
The farm was fairly self-supporting. 
Old-time threshing, for "a week at a time." 
Growing 3 or 4 stalks of chewing tobacco. 
Tobacco came into the mountains locally about 20 years 
ago, though EJ says it has always been raised 
down belovj the mountains." 
Difficulty of obtaining a tobacco base from the gov’t

"It's not what you make, it’s what you save.” 
KJ born In 1909. 
Kids are different now than they were 50 years ago. 
Changes in the house through theyears. 
We walk down to the house. 
Kitchen table used to sit in the middle of the main living 
room (north room). 
Stone can house was built by KJ; stone wall in front of 
dwelling house by IJ; early stone work was unmortared. 
The can house ("dwelling house") has an upper vent which 
must be blocked in very cold weather. 
Front porch was wooden; had furniture, and was much used. 
Front porch support posts used to be simple 4-by-4’s. 
Contents and use of the north room; beds, table, stove. 
Boards framing in the fireplace were original; mantel once 
held a clock and some pictures. 
Mirror on west wall of north room covers site of former window 
Electricity came in 1946, and they got a pump for the well. 
Earlier use of the springhouse. 
Spring water is better. 
Stealing a watermelon (with his cousin) when they were 6 yrs 
old. 
EJ's friends and relatives lived on neighboring farms. 
Population density used to be higher} once eight families, 
now two. 
Neighbors sharing labor to erect buildings; "swap work." 
Stripping cane for molasses was swap work. 
Making molasses. Stripping the fodder before frost. Hauling 
cane to the cane mill, where they made two boilers a day. 
Price of molasses, then and now; $l/gal versus #12/gal. 
Square dances held in north room, with neighbors; four to 
six couples, dancing to fiddle, guitar, banjo, mandolin. 
Some of the musicians; Dewey Anders, Hous Caudill. 
The«^flc: calls it "bluegrass" then corrects himself; 
Inis would be more old-time than bluegrass." 
RouShSh??^ngS^anlWOnd"SatherlngS» and 9 danca afterwards. 
Rough times, in the Depression and before. 
They raised all their meat; chickens, cattle, hogs, eggs 
J pother churned butter, mold it with a "buttfr printer"

Start; microphone noise 
Family relations: Ira Jarvis married Adeline; EJ’s 
father was Andrew Kemper Jarvis, married Eva Andrews. 
EJ has two sisters, Pauline and Lois. Mrs. EJ is 
Margaret, and their son is named Alan. (7 years old) 
EJ lived on the farm, and so did his sisters, and 
also his wife (briefly). 
Difficulty of getting off the farm during heavy snowfalls 
Remembrances of heavy snow in i960. Snow still at the 
end of April; 25 foot drifts; 6 feet snow on the 
ground. 
When EJ was a boy, he'd set "rabbit gums" in the snow, 
but would not catch anything when the snow was deep. 
The past two winters have been the coldest, and the 
Past two summers the hottest EJ can remember. 
Description of the kitchen and the changes made in the 
house when the back addition was added. 
There used to be a back porch; before the addition, 
the family essentially lived in two rooms; KJ's 
brother and sister lived upstairs for a while. 
Heating the rooms with the fireplaces. 
The addition was done in the 1940*s, perhaps '41 or '42. 
Before addition, the north room was the kitchen and 
r room; closet used for food storage, plates, etc 
Leftovers also put in warming oven. 
Typical breakfast: ham, eggs, gravy, biscuits, when EJ 
was young. 
Raising beef and hogs. EJ's favorite cuts: shoulder 
sausage. ’ 
EJ's mother made sausage; "I've turned that sausage mill

Shelves in the can house used to be filled with home-canned 
goods. Everybody canned everything. 
Sievin's Crossroads had a store, which would sell and trade. 
EJ used to swap eggs for soft drinks. 
KJ used to take food to the store and exchange it for a 
"due bill", which he could use to buy food. 
Store items were kerosene, matches, shoes, clothes, flour. 
Corn meal was ground by EJ’s cousin who had a mill, but 
the store was the source for thingslike coffee, nails, 
horseshoes, etc. "They had a full line...." 
EJ’s first trip to Galax; KJ and brother had hewed out 
cross-ties (in the 30*s) and they went to sell. 
Ej's first commercial ice-cream; he was used to homemade 
ice cream" made of snow and vanilla flavoring. 
Selling those cross-ties for 35!z' apiece; hewn on two sides. 
The trip to Galax was a long all-day affair, and involved 
a different route, down the river bed past Baywood. 
along gravel roads. 
Description of the changes in the route to Galax. 
We move into the south room, which EJ slept in; description

Start; we walk down towards the blacksmith shop. 
KJ’s blacksmithing was not for neighbors, just for 
his own needs. Sharpening saws. 
EJ opens up the shop door, describes tools: free; 
fancy door hinge. 
KJ made a good many hinges, but not fancy ones. 
Homemade hoe. 
Twist .Auger for boring holes in house beams, for pegs. 
Marking scribe. 
Mattock, probably made by IJ. Used with wedges to 
split wood. 
EJ has worked in the shop, but not like his father did. 
One-man and two-man saws. 
■KJ's "hobby" was to make singletrees when winter weather 
limited his farm work. 
Homemade shovel, probably made by IJ for a fireplace tool. 
EJ watched his father blacksmithing, but never learned; 
when KJ was working (on bad days), EJ was off 
sawmilling. 
EJ shows us a plane with wooden body; says the wooden 
part was homemade, the -metal part was "Northern" 
i.e., manufactured. 
Anything that they didn't make here, why they said 
'We've got to order it from the North.'" " ’ 
Draw-knife; EJ says it was used to bark trees. 
Other items in the shop: cream separator (described) 
changed into a grinder; buckwheat drill, for 
planting, horse-drawn.

Model T wrench held up; KJ bought a Model A ford in 1936. 
Horseshoe hoof-rasp, other odds and ends examined. 
Larger items: a wagon and two mowing machines are in the 
shed. They were bought from Galax, thinks EJ, and used 
to have much larger wheels, but smaller wheels let one 
carry a larger load. 
EJ remembers playing games: baseballl. 
Work was more important, though: Working in the cornfields 
from 7 AM till dinner, then continue till 6 PM. 
School in the wintertime only, near Blevins Crossroads; EJ 
walked over the hill to the school. Perhaps 25 or 30 
students in all, representing all grades, in two rooms. 
EJ only went to the local school, through seventh grade. 
Alan has to go about eight miles to school, now. 
School ran from Oct. through March; and college was 
"SStaovpSfhQi? EJhS yout]2\0f his classmates and friends, 
not over half a dozen of 'em went to high school." 
:rll°JrV0r Unc,le at 8 sawmm When he got out 
of school, at age 14. Worked on sawmill till 1969. 
0 41 so worked on a farm, and a little construction work. 
Sawmilll work was serious; not too many pranks or tricks 
in the old days. EJ's uncle was serious and "no 
foolishness about him." Timekeeping for pay was strict, 
and the pay was 10^/hour. 
EJ worked for his father ard uncle cleaning sawdust out of 
the way of the mill for 15^/day, later 20//day. Also 
working.WSter fr°m th6 spring for the eiSht ten men 
EJ logged with horses, for his uncle. 
In 1964 EJ got his own sawmill and ran it till 1969

000 Start: EJ talks about the small log building south 
of the house, north of the shop. There was never a 
fireplace in it, but people occasionally stayed in it 
using quilts for warmth. 
030 EJ points out the large size of the hewn logs; one 
pair of them came from a single tree; most of the logs 
are oak, one is chestnut-oak (?) 
059 The little log building (EJ calls it a house) was sealed 
on the Inside; 
070 EJ says the little log house was used as a granary, and 
was the second building built on the farm 
094 EJ’s sisters don’t qMlt, but they probqbly know how 
104 Margaret Jarvis and her mother made some quilts the 
previous winter 
110 EJ's sister’s left home and went to work after school, 
but he never saw them quilt any. 
126 EJ's mother used to help hoe corn — the whole family 
^worked — and the sisters learned to cook early: 
"I,d say ten years old, they could cook a meal." 
145 Sometimes EJ's mother would cook dinner at the same time 
as breakfast, then go work in the cornfields and 
simply warm up the food at dinnertime. 
155 EJ's mother also worked at binding grain; she never 
cut timber with a crosscut saw, but some of EJ's 
aunts did; one was killed by a tree falling, and she 
is burled in the Jarvis cemetery.

Richard McCamant asks about the age and use of a black 
walnut tree; EJ says its 15 yrs. old; value of black walnut 
lumber is high. 
KJ probably didn’t make the chains fastening gates on the 
farm. 
EJ points out the buildings across the valley, which used 
to include a house build in 1926, in which an aunt 
lived. An uncle also lived across the valley. 
EJ points out his property line, which reaches down to 
Crab Creek and Little River 
The spring and springhouse, under a large, old, lightning- 
struck tree. It needs to be cut, but: "They claim, when 
you cut one that's that close to a spring, it’s liable 
to cause the spring to go dry." 
The spring water is not the same water as that in the creek. 
EJ dug a well last year, 245 feet deep. 
EJ points out the importante of water to the early settlers; 
"The old people, they'd go build close to water. You'd 
be surprised if you could see some places where houses 
have been." 
The house is high above the spring because of the danger of 
floods; in 1941 Little River flooded up all the way to 
Jarvis's springhouse. 
We go inside the springhouse; it has a shelf and trough 
for cooling milk in crocks. The water tastes feood, but 
not after it goes through the pump and the plastic pipe. 
EJ points out the vent in the ceiling and the necessity 
of ventilating all enclosed spaces. 
Wooden barrel used as concrete form for spring waterhole. 
We try the water; it's very good and refreshing. 
EJ points out the foundation of the old springhouse, all 
laid up by his father. 
EJ shows us the swimming hole where he and his cousin played 
Bathing in the Little River; damming the creek for fun. 
°fIDetery ls quite old - "close to a hundred years old". 
EJ s grandather and -mother are not buried there. Old 
gravestones made of plain field rock. 
EJ points out where old rail fences used to be; describes 
the extent of the farm on the Little River side 
TheLUSf t0 ^n°e, offthe land for the crops, Just an acre 
or two, a "truck patch;" 
Planting time: Corn around the tenth of May. But oldtimers 
went by signs: EJ tells of an old neighbor who told him 
to plant potatoes by signs. His mother still does. 
Shingles on roofs must be split on the correct sign, "When 
the points of the moon are turned down."

000 EJ tells me to call him if there's more I need to knovi. 
013 Margaret Jarvis grevi up in the vicinity of Larel Springs, 
in Ashe Co., near Vfest Jefferson; they moved into 
this area in 1963 and EJ met her at a dance, married 
her Oct. 2, 1965• Alan was born July 28, 1971. MJ 
quit work when Alan was born, and has not resumed, 
s sisters; pne is a houseviife, and one works in 
Winston, N.C., making airplane seats. The housewife 
lives in Galax, and is about 44 yrs. old. 
doesn't dance much anymore, but two weeks ago MJ 
and Alan went to a house dance. EJ and MJ have both 
put on weight and don't dance anymore. 
092 Dances are now at the VFW halls, not at houses like they 
used to be; sometimes house dances would be large 
and public, but they might get too rowdy; problems 
with drink, et.c, Dances are still held at 
Independence and Fairview. EJ used to like to dance, 
and could dance "pretty good." Dances held in the 
wintertime, mostly. 
144 Many dances were held in th& old Jarvis house (old log 
house). 
149 The old log house was used as a wood house, years ago. 
No one has lived in it for 75 years. The frame house 
is about 100 years old, but the log house is old; 
1?5 Our asking about the houses prompted EJ to ask some of 
his elder neighbors and relatives, but most that would 
know the answers have passed away. 
188 Perhaps the logs for the house were floated down the 
river; there used to be more water in the river. 
195 Water levels in the ground have also dronnAri.

Finding waterlines with copper wires 
EJ guesses that the old hand-dug wells were located with 
Peachtree limbs; EJ explains the rationale for his 
belief: some wells are deep, next to shallow ones. "I 
believe in that peachtree stuff, now." 
Forecasting snow by animal behavior: rabbits get on the 
south side of the hill when it's going to snow. EJ 
feels there’s something to these things, because animals 
hide from bad weather a day before. 
EJ has heard that when bees build their nests high up in 
the tree, it will be a bad winter. "Old people went by 
all them signs, but they had many signs that I don't 
know nothing about, now." 
In cases of illness, people did use the doctors in the 
area, e.g., Dr. Thompson in Sparta, who is now 80 yrs. old. 
Also used herbs, like ginseng and catnip. 
For a cough, dissolve whiskey and peppermint candy. Or 
honey, sugar, and water. 
EJ* s mother would make cough medicine from brown sugar and 
water. 
EJ heard of bloodstoppers, but he doesn't know about that; 
he suspects they would bind up the wound somehow. 
One of EJ's uncles died of blood poisoning when he was 22, 
T?-r«an^ ”,^wo 0T ^ree ,em died when they was pretty young." 
EJ s father died at 57 years of age; the rest of 'em lived 
up into their 70's. 
Not all the graves in the Jarvis cemetery are Jarvis's; 
there are some neighbors also: Shaws and Fortners. 
We walk back up the hill towards the house. 
Before the small meat house was built, meat was stored in 
the little log granary; 
Hog butchering: communal, with perhaps six to ten hogs 
killed, of which two were for the family. Hog 
butchering described. 
EJ points out a hornet's nest that is very high in the tree: 
might mean a bad snow. 
The old log house is too far gone to fix up, but the logs 
are still usable; one could make a one-room log cabin 
from it. 
EJ talks about the old log house, points out features on 
the windows and doors. 
We walk past the privy; EJ says it's only 20 years old. 
The large rock piles are the field stone picked upby 
EJ points out Little River, just visible in the distance.

proceeded "with paper and pencil" because her parents 
didn’t want RW coming around 
Despite the opposition, RW and MW didn’t run off to marry; 
MV/: "I wasn’t gonna run away." 
RW explains that MW was tied down closely to her family, and 
couldn't get away.

MW: "I didn't have no entertainment, myself." As a child, 
MW Just went to school and tended her crippled sister 
RW begins to look around for some family photos which show 
his grandfather 
MW's family has also lived in this area for generations, but 
she doesn't know where, or whence they came 
MV/ went to school at the old school (now a house) across the 
road and slightly north 
RW continues to search for old pictures 
There was a Weddle family reunion a few weeks ago; they had 
dinner together, had a few talks, played the organ ( and 
sang?), and gave out prizes for the oldest and the farthest 
traveller to the reunion; this is the sixxth reunion. 
There was lots to eat, but MW (who is ill) couldn't eat much 
PM asks about the Weddle's usual food; MV/ says whatever they 
want, only RW doesn't like any foods with milk in them — 
Milk makes him ill. 
MW is canning some temacbb soup; she also cans beans, tomatoes 
RW produces an old photo (Gf. 10-20424, frames 18-21) of 
musicians on the Slusher home front porch; it includes 
RV/'s father and grandfather

with banjo, on old photo 
RW searches for a photo to show PM 
RW shows PM a recent photo of one of his uncles 
RW says his grandfather was also a Brethern preacher 
MW hates to look at the photos of dead relatives,

More photos brought out of Weddle relatives 
PM gives TA an album of funeral pictures to copy 
MW identifies a picture of her mother’s grandmother 
Janice Weddle assembled the albums for RW and MW 
PM asks RW about a hunting dog shown in a photo, then 
about hunting in general: coon hunting, squirrels, 
foxes. 
The dog was shot by someone, but was never hurt hunting 
Local game: deer, but no bears or panthers 
There used to be panthers, years back, but no more 
PM asks about weird creatures in the woods, but the 
Weddles don't know of any 
They don't know any "haint tales" either 
RW gives us two of his wooden kitchen utensils; 
explains that it won’t scratch the pots you cook in 
RW never put his name on anything he made 
MW reminds RW to show us the big knife and sheath he made 
RW says he used to make knives; goes to get some to 
show us 
RW shows us the big one (photographed) which he made 
back several years ago"; the sheath was sawed out 
by his brother 
Woods used: black walnut, laurel 
RW made the knives from old crosscut saws 
He no longer makes knives because his eyes are bad and 
there is no power in his shop, since a sleet storm 
pulled down the power-line to the shop

278 I get RW to pose with his knives (in his doorway) 
He bangs the blades together repeatedly, ringing them 
loudly 
290 MV/ shows PM some photos of her family, which was all girls 
297 RW: "When you get a piece that rings like that, you got 
a good piece." 
315 RW says one day he decided to make a knife with a guard 
on it; someone said he couldn’t do it — "and there 
it is!" 
322 We continue to admire RW’s collection of knives 
332 RW briefly describes his technique: he marks out the outline 
of the blade on the old saw-blank and then cuts it 
out using a cold-chisel; "That wasn’t cut out, it was 
broke out." Then the blade is ground and honed and 
handled. 
3^3 PM figured out knife-making on his own; no one showed him 
how. 
353 I ask about the use of the biggest knife: MV/ replies, it’s 
for cutting up hogs, some of which are very thick 
357 RW butchered hogs for other people, not himself only 
365 Ten to twenty hogs a day! Now RW has quit because his 
rheumatism prevents his working in all the water 
367 The Weddles didn't raise hogs, just butchered 
369 Keeping the clients' hogs separate 
372 RW brings out another knife, crescent shaped: a corn knife, 
for topping corn 
389 Another butcher knife, marked with the initial "R" 
395 I admire a knife with a walnut burl handle 
398 RW shows us the knife he made second, at about age 15, 
from a saw file 
407 RW relates how he watched his father make some knives, then 
tried his own hand at it 
413 "Now here’s one that’ll bite ye!" RW shows us a sharp knife 
4l6 MW tells how the man who pulled her teeth in Hlllsville 
got two knives from RW and incorrectly tested the edges 
and "...cut his thumb ’fore you could say ’Scat!'" 
425 RW sharpens his knives on each other; demonstrates and 
explains how other people do it by way of contrast. 
"See, I don't cut it. Just slick it." 
445 I ask about butchering time 
451 PM tests the edge on the knife RW sharpened 
455 RW used to butcher from 4AM till 10PM, continuously 
462 RW has killed seven or eight thousaAd hogs; he worked for 
pay, not for a share of the meat; sometimes people gave 
him meat though 
470 RV/'s father and grandfather both butchered hogs, and he 
learned from them 
473 RW always scalded hogs, never skinned them; MV/ say s 
skinned hogs don't look right, and she likes some of 
the skin 
RW never needed a thermometer to test the scalding water; 
he used to add wood ashes to the water; problems of 
setting the hair

RW and MW recall a case where domeone using a 
thermometer got the water too hot and set the hair 
RW explains his rule, also used by his father: if you 
can swipe your finger through the water three times 
only, then it's right; if it burns you the first time, 
it’ll set the hair 
The right day to butcher is whenever you want to 
But butchering by the signs is all right too, and will 
prevent the meat from spattering 
If you cook a piece of meat and it curls up, it was killed 
on the new moon 
MW is planning to pick potatoes in the middle of next 
week, on the old moon, so they will store better and 
not dry up 
RW shows us the edge on one of his knives by holding a 
piece of paper out in the air and cutting it easily

than a pound — for over forty dollars

last step is to smooth it with shavings of wood, till 
it's "smooth as an onion!"

Index # Outline 
000 Start - I identify my informant as Harrison Caudle 
007 He is 86 years old, and he logins to tell his story: 
008 He spent his whole life around here, except for 
three or four brief trips away 
Born at Old Hickory Flats on Feb. 11, 1892 
HC is"3/^ white and i red" 
HC's father was "old man Harrison Caudle", who 
married twice and had 11 children by each wife; 
HC was his son, but he was found one morning in 
a shuck basket on his doorstep 
Raised by Martin Caudle and Janie Blevins Caudle as 
a "forest child" 
When he was 10 or 12, people found out he was a 
quarter Indian, and harassed him so he left that 
home and moved to Whitehead. 
Lived sixty years in Wilkes Co. 
Martin Caudle was "old man Harrison’s" boy, but 
HC spent about as much time with the"old man" 
as with Martin; Martin build a log cabin when 
HC was small 
HC knew eveybody that lived down there (just across the 
parkway in Wilkes), and there were mere Caudills 
than any other name; five Harrison Caudills in all 
HC identifies all the other Harrison Caudills 
HC says he took rangers through some of what is now 
Doughton Park and identififed the homes of those 
viho were washed out by the 1916 flood 
HC tells about old man Harrison Caudill’s experience 
during the flood 0 
HC assures me of his truthfulness 
HC generalizes about life in the old days: they raised 
everything, made everything, worked hard 
HC says he knows everytone who ever lived in that 
mountain where he grew up 
I ask about the Crouse farm: HC tells me about 
Henderson and Elbert Crouse 
058 
065 
077 
093 
105 
110 
BR8-TA-R10, continued 
168 "I learnt to cook, I can cook Just as good as any vfoman..." 
170 During the war HC worked as a cook In Lynchburg, Vil., 
and saw relatives and worked long hours there 
193 How Fugit branch got It's name (the Fuglt family Ti/ed there) 
200 Only three black people lived on that mountain 
207 "I know everybody, and they’re all dead and gone..." 
210 More about the 1916 flood, which washed away cabins 
even fairly high on the mountain! 
229 During the flood, even big plants and buildings viere washed 
away as far as Wilkesboro. 
236 Once while HC was giving a talk up at the Parkway (!) someone 
claimed to have driven up to old man Harrison Caudill’s 
doorstep; but, says HC, there wasn’t even a sled-road 
in there for years; "...I says, you can't get over it 
viith an airplane, hardly!" 
252 The Caudill family came from Ireland and they settled during 
the viar; the first, John Franklin Caudill, was buried 
in or near Mt. Mry; HC retells a story about him being 
ambushed near a cave up under the mountain 
283 HC tells about how old man HC almost married a 3/^- Indian 
290 HC s detailed knowledge of the locale: "I know every cave, 
every crook and turn, I can show you places over there 
that I'll go in there, blind as I am, and you can't 
even find me, with bloodhounds or nothing...." 
295 ^ local cave 
301 HC married twice: once to old man Joe Bellow's girl and 
once to "the old man Clay Waggoner's daughter"! and 
they're both dead 
303 HC has one child, who lives in Wilkes Co. 
309 After the flood, HC went over to the mountain with a bunch 
of rangers and a woman stenographer and told them 
where and what everything was; this happened when the 
Parkway was new 
318 HC tells of his own family's experience during the flood; 
nothing was left but a stone chimney — "nexxt morning 
daylight come, I had nothing." 
325 More about the flood of 1916 
3^0 Water was waist-deep on the ridge near the Brinegar cabin 
350 Finding bodies after the flood 
370 "You've heard the old song about John Brown being hung in 
a sour apple tree, ain't you? Well right there's the 
place... .vjhere the old man John Brovin vias hung, right 
down on Basin Creek, up from them double chimneys...." 
380 After the flood, HC went on living there for a while, then 
moved to Conorock, Va. "Everybody moved out." 
384 HC viorked then grading railroad tracks, for 5^/hour, 
for the next eight years, working in the summers and 
falls; 
388 Then HC moved back; so did others. 
390 Martin Caudill died around 1932. 
405 HC was too old to be in World War I, but he can't supply 
the details; it's hard being old and almost blind;"I'm 
a-rottin’ dovm fast....” 
BR8-TA-R10, continued 
418 HC talks of his former strength and health; ”1 say, 
people rot before they die." 
422 HC has been hunting for a house for the past month, but 
small lots are very high now; once he owned 800 acres 
which he bought for #600, but now he must stay in the 
little house in bad repair in V/hitehead: "looks like 
I’m going to have to Just get my wood in and die here." 
432 HC recounts his infirmities, which are many 
442 Still — "I know the true history of these mountains." 
455 HC helped to build the house that’s now gone, near the 
Crouse farm cemefeery; the log one is "the old house - 
it’s been there I guess for two hundred ferears" 
466 HC says the old house was built by Elbert Crouse; when I 
question this, he explains that it was the grandfather 
of Elbert, also named Elbert, who built the house; 
4?0 Old man Harrison Caudill was 184 years old when he died. 
473 "They had namesakes, see, Just kept it in the family." 
HC explains, with examples, how first names are shared 
" to keep the namesake in the family". 
485 I ask about houses: HC says he’s built 75 or 80 log houses: 
490 "Well, you cut your timber and you saddle it out. You 
cut it on a 45 degree, straight down here. And this other’n’s 
cut on the degree straight down, and that saddle goes 
down like that. Called "saddling" . And every log— 
and it's saddled up. The log end sticks over that way 
and you build it up, and then you— The wall plate 
here is a big log, and you bore a hole through your 
long rafters, and a peg goes down there, it comes to¬ 
gether up here, instead of nailing it, there's a hole 
bored, and pegs went through it. And then you split 
shingles and boards and put them over there, and made 
homemade nails, and mail 'em on." 
500 Making nails; HC had a device for heading nails, but it 
burnt up in his old house. 
516 The siae of a log house: "Well, they’s different size. 
Some wants all the way from 12 by 16, 16 by 24. And 
sometimes you build two and leave a space in the middle 
here, and’d be open at each end, and'd be floored in 
there, used as a floor. And the kitchen one end the 
sleeping quarters the other end.” HC says no name 
for that type. 
522 "And sometimes we’d box it up at each end and make a room 
in the middle. The house standin’ now at the Meadow place, 
the Joe Caudill place, now, is Sehw done the same way." 
526 End - continued on BR8-TA-R11

Continuation on log houses - HC describes 
a double-pen log cabin with end chimneys, possibly 
with a dogtrot variation 
"One man can build it, if he’s stout.” 
I marvel: how can you move the logs alone? 
"You set a dead man.” HC describes using a lever 
arsangement to press the logs up an Incline. Notches 
are cut af&er the log has been lifted up. 
’’Forty logs, 14" by 16" through make a good wall. 
Forty logs, ten to each side. Well, you split out 
your puncheons and you run 'em in them cracks down 
there, about that thick. Take a foot adze, you 
hewed them off, smooth as you could get 'em, and 
that was the floor." 
Puncheons defined. 
Building chimneys from stone against a bank, in 
order to use all the level land for garden. 
No yards; vegetables growing up in the front 
of the house: turnip, parsnip, carrot, beets, 
parsley, beans, everything. 
Going to school four months of the year; miles 
for HC to walk to school at Basin Creek along an 
old sheep trail 
Everyone worked, even kids; but kids don't work now. 
HC tells how he can outspell lots of people who have 
been to school and graduated; but now the language 
is changing - "they don't teach English any more" 
In fact, HC has a grandson that he can't understand 
hardly at all. 
Some of the Caudill boys used to help make liquor, and 
Hr S° iJUnk you understand them. 
the^oSnsMners 3 ^ ^ k®Pt bother^ 
HC tells of another youngster Mho speaks unintelligibly 
BR8-TA-R11, continued 
220 HC gives an example of the degeneration of the languages 
instead of saying "playing," modern kids say "versus," 
e.g., it’l be the White Sox versus Mb. Airy. 
229 "They talk all kinds of language, and I can’t understand ’em. 
232 I ask about old stories; HC coughs and takes some medicine. 
245 How to kill a bear: "Chop a hole in the ice and pour 
chop in. When a bear goes down in there to eat, go 
up and kick him in the icehole." 
265 How they kill bears now - get the bear running and run 
him onto a cliff, and "he’d stop so quick his rear 
end* d run up there on his neck an d choke him to death." 
281 HC killed his first bear at age 6. They were living then 
in a house with no floor, just hard red clay dirt. The 
bear dug his nose under the log wall, and HC shot him 
with a muzzle-loading shotgun, and the recoil hurt him 
some, and bloodied his face. 
323 HC tells about his chronic foot and leg trouble. 
333 HC explains his Indian blood: "My great-grandmother on 
my mother’s side was a full-blooded Cherokee Indian. 
And her husband, when the white folks first settled 
Plymouth Rock, her husband took up with an Indian woman, 
her husband was killed at Little Bighorn River, in 
Montana...." 
336 And she married "a Shoshone Indian chief." 
349 HC tells about one time when he ran away an lived a summer 
or two with the Indians down in the §moky Mountains 
355 HC mentions some of the people he worked for; he often 
worked for 25s^/day. 
385 HC worked for a while making liquor — "it was a bootlegger 
country, you know...." 
400 "I Just drifted in and out of here all my life." 
414 HC recalls the hard winter of 1950* and high snow-drifts. 
430 HC has lived in his present house for seven years. 
44o He now acts as watchman for the post office, across the 
road; evidently the store-owners fixed up the little 
house and let HC live in it to watch the store. 
475 HC talks about local dispute over roads and land, and the 
problems that continue with road-closings 
500 Modern prisons are too soft and cushy; prisoners make 
home-brew, and with no executions, they're jjust 
fattening up the prisoners at public expense. 
The roads are all grown up, but they used to make 
convicts viork along the roads. 
518 HC begins to cite the Bible and talk about being raised 
with and by the Bible. 
530 HC has acted as a doctor many times, "in the old-fashioned 
way," treating diphtheria, scarlet fever, broken bones. 
535 An incident of HC stopping blood recounted; he says the 
gift is mentioned in the Bible. "I believe I was 
born to prophecy." 
550 HC prophecied the 1916 flood; also engaged in prophecies 
around the time of the first World War.

000 HC prophecied the onset of W.W. I; he recounts the 
story 
035 HC prophecies another "world-wide war", because the 
"end of time's gettin' close." 
038 HC begins to cite reasons: the Bible mentioning 
people flocking from the cities to the mountains, 
and that has been going on; also "turning from 
the old ways" 
055 HC quotes the Bible: Book of John 
060 HC mentions Nebuchadnezzar and prophecy 
O65 Revelations spoke of "four houses", and HC says 
W.W.I was the first horse. 
075 "The Bible speaks of all these things." 
085 •HC links these prophecies of the end to social and 
political upheaval: "Well, the blacks is a-takin' 
over...." 
090 Gun registration doesn't apply to blacks, who can 
get all the guns you want; HC mentions an occasion 
when he was in a black house and saw it filled with 
guns 
108 "It's a-coming one way or, the other, the end of time, 
or they may start a war afore it gets here." 
114 "I pray every night." HC tells me about his evening 
routine, and how he woke one evening and had a 
vision of these things: "I seed this world, and it 
looked like it was all melted. Everything was 
burnt up...." HC continues describing his vision. 
"I'd say inside of seven years is the coming of Times." 
ft 
BR8-Ti\-R12, continued 
206 Account of hovi HC healed a small girl with an Injury 
to the nose, which would not stop bleeding. 
220 "Now they say that's witchery. Twenty-sixth chapter of 
Ezeklal over there, and read it...." HC quotes 
from memory a part of the verse. 
234 I ask if he’s used the verse to help in stopping people’s 
blood: "Hundreds of ’em." HC tells of a time when 
he worked in Virginia and helped on a rescue squad; 
254 HC mentions his studying medicine in theold time way, and 
cites the example of two other local men who were 
fine doctors but not accepted in the local hospital 
because they doctored in the old time way. 
260 Doctoring the old time way: using herbs; HC cites the 
Bible again, first to defend doctoring with herbs, then 
to support the eating of meat. 
285 I ask HC what herbs he has used: "plantain, dock, speckled 
dock, blue-belly dock, groundhog sallet, and all kinds 
of wild leaves, bittersass __, and bitter elm, 
elder bark, wild cherry bark, ginseng...! could name 
thousands of herbs.... They're good for medicine and 
to eat. " 
294 "There's a medicine in your yard that will kill anything 
if you know how to use it." 
295 Use of herbs: catnip, boneset, pennyroyal, meadowmint. 
303 HC tells of the time in Conorock, VA., when he caught the 
7-year itch and cured it. 
312 HC says he worked in Conorock in 1918, when the influenza 
killed thousands. He worked then as an undertaker; 
324 HC says the average lifespan has decline, during his 
lifetime, from 80 years to JO years, citing as the 
reasons wars, earthquakes, and abortions. 
340 HC oomes back to an earlier topic: abortions are a sign 
that the end is near. 
345 HC goes to get a book to show me: it contains drawings of 
developing fetuses, which HC thinks are photographs 
370 HC says abortion is murder, and cites Scripture to say 
that no murderer shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven. 
"I don't believe in that business." 
393 HC talks about contraceptive devices, which he somehow 
links with the decline in morality and the rise of 
abortions. 
397 HC tells me how good his knowledge of the Bible is, how 
much he can quote; account of how he could identify any 
verse a neighbor woman read to him. 
415 Account of how HC quoted scripture in church one day about 
40 years ago to criticize men with long hair and women 
who cut their hair off short. 
430 HC tells how he changed his church membership because they 
didn't read the Bible enough in hisold church, just 
"Preached to suit the people." 
BR8-T71-R12, continued 
450 HC recounts story of a burial service during which 
a preacher identified a child in need of baptism, 
somewhat cruelly, and HC comforted them with Scripture. 
483 HC wanders on to the subject of Mam and Eve and the 
forbidden fruit: "i\nd a lot of people waat to know what 
that fruit is. It haln’t a thing in the world but 
that thing a woman's got between her legs." 
494 HC explicates the story of Mam and Eve, identifying the 
mark put upon Cain as the origin of the black race. 
517 HC embroiders the story: Mam and Eve's third child 
was Rebecca, who bore first a white child, then 
a black child who was Solomon, then a girl child. 
525 HC breaks off: "You want to get down in the Bible, I 
can get down on it." 
527 I ask about religious conversion^but HC says he 
was brought up in the religious life. 
532 V/hen HC was eight or ten, he began to be able to say 
grace at the table, and dt age 14 he "confessed to 
hope in Christ and was baptized." 
536 HC was called to preach at age 21. "Man didn't call me."

Personal and Family Reminiiscences 
Index # Outline 
000 Start - I ask JK for family history 
009 JK says shes knows Slusher ancestors back to 1754, 
when a "Schlosser" came from Germany to Pennsylvania 
030 The Keiths have compiled detailed genealogy sheets 
039 There is a formal Slusher family organization, which 
has undertaken the creation of a Slusher genealogy 
068 --which will he published as a large book 
091 JK guesses about how "Schlosser" became "Slusher" 
102 By the time they came to Floyd Co., the name was Slusher 
117 I change to different microphones: cardioids 
123 JK's father developed her sense of family 
140 When in high school, JK photographed her family's farm — 
—the house was the first in the area to have nails 
147 Story about an elder of the church criticizing the 
use of nails: "...the house that my grandfather built 
the first in the area to be built with nails. And 
one of the elders had come by and said to my 
grandfather that he was going to kill Elder Corn’s 
daughter by building her a house like that; it 
wasn’t going to hold up, the fact that he had used 
nails instead of the wooden pegs and so forth, uh, 
log construction that had been done, or was being 
done in the area before that time...." 
156 More about the house: it is now filled with hay 
lo2 I ask about the immediate families:JK*s parents are 
Ruth and Freeman Slusher; her brother, 5 years younger 
Freeman Slusher, Jr.; her sister Nancy Lou Taylor 
182 DJ's parents were Dewey Jewel Keith and V/eeta Gay (?) 
One brother, who had encephalitis at 6 months, was 
helpless for a long time, died at age 18. DJ is 
the only surviving son 
1present Keith home is on the old Keith land 
210 I ask about the houses theyve lived in? DJ was raised 
in the house his parents now live in, at Union. The 
way the land used to be; the old mill and mill-race 
BR8-TA-R19* continued 
243 BJ's father was raised in the old house, up on the hill 
(Cf. negatives 12-20424) 
250 BJ’s grandfather gave land to the church and the school in 
Union; the look <bf the land changed after the milldam 
burst. 
2?0 The quality of the land where the millpond used to be. 
282 JK lived briefly in a log house, the old Slusher place, 
till she was 3* Then they built a brick house and 
new barn, to enlarge their dairy operation. 
311 VJhen BJK and JK were married, they lived in a trailer in 
Asheville, N.C. while BJ was at Mars Hill College 
325 Moving back to Floyd, living first in a trailer, then 
in their new brick house 
360 I ask about their childhoods, about growing up in Floyd... 
370 JK’s earliest memories: of the house; family; the milking lot 
riding on a milk-sled; her mother supplying butter to 
the neighbors; sitting in a field while her mother hoed 
corn. 
4?0 JK's parents’ lived with both relatives and neighbors 
nearby; relations with neighbors; selling butter and eggs; 
her father was assistant postmaster, but felt as if the 
job wasn’t physical and outdoors enough for him; 
530 BJ interjects: during the Bepression, Freeman Slusher’s 
father George Slusher was almost broke, and that’s when 
FS bought some land and quit postmastering 
541 BJ: "The Beptesssion broke a lot of people in the country." 
545 JK: Ihe hard timesleft a mark on her parents and other 
older relatives, who are conservative, saving people, 
not at all frivolous; they didn’t get a television till 
JK was in 6th grade 
595 F. Slusher’s cars, remembered and recounted by BJ and JK 
615 JK didn’t have many friends to play with; entertainment was 
cutting out people from Sears catalog and playing with 
them; also dress-up in parent’s clothes 
650 BJ: Less free time back then; BJ used to work and play 
with neighbors as kids, later they would swap work. 
688 BJ’s first date: a triple date (three couples) 
705 BJ and Janet began to date in the senior year in high school 
715 BJ says there’s a shortage of wholesome entertainment for 
young people in the county 
755 Work has to come first; they don’t have time to play much. 
770 Local people take pride in their work and their land. 
785 More about the land; Keiths love it; all the water fiows 
out of Floyd Co., not into it; good water quality

Outline 
JK gives dates of first Schlossers and early history, 
origins; Jacob Slasher came to Floyd Co. in 1792 
DJ wonders why they didn't settle in the Shenandoah Valley 
JK gives possible reasons for the decision to settle in 
Floyd; she'd like to think it was the land. 
Three Slashers: one settled in Floyd, one in Montgomery 
Co., and one moved to Missouri and was a gunsmith 
JK has traced the Keith lineage to England; the Keiths 
now have his grandfather's Civil War musket 
JK explains that they have few heirlooms because of the 
custom of having an auction after the parents deaths. 
—"It's still the custom” 
DJ recounts an example. 
The money raised at the auction pays for burial expenses 
and any remainder is divided among the children 
But some people have a little private auction before 
the public one, to thwart the antique dealers 
DJ: Old photos of the family wouldn't bring much at 
auction, but they're priceless to the family 
—One photo of the family features a dead patriarch 
I ask about schooling and school experelences; DJ 
describes the school systems: the school he attended 
was built in 1939, 'with help from his uncle Othar, 
who worked there as custodian 
DJ went to Willis Elementary, then old Floyd High, then 
Floyd Co. High, then Mars Hill College. 
When the Keiths married and began their herd, the 
first cow was named "Happy"; other cow names. 
DJ’s experiences and low pay as a high school football 
and baseball coach. 
The Keiths now have approx. 100 head of cattle and 
400-500 acres. 
240 
BR8-T.A-R20, continued 
253 JK explains that DJ gave up coaching because he 
didn’t have time to teach, farm and also coach 
264 DJ felt that he grew up poorer than some other local 
folks, with outdoor facilities till he was in the 
9th grade. 
281 DJ? "We're basically self-sufficient.*' 
285 —with the help of neighbors 
290 JK mentions how people brirg food when there's either a 
death or serious illness. 
307 DJ's first cousin was killed in Vietnam, and it was 
the family (esp. DJ) who dug the grave and "tromped" it; 
n&lghbors would often help with gravedigging. 
335 DJ describes how a grave would be dug, a vault set, and 
a casket lowered into it; why graves used to be rounded 
up into a pile of earth. 
371 When DJ's brother died, in 1959» the neighbors dug his grave 
380 But now the funeral homes handle everything, except in 
small family cemeteries. 
414 DJ’s parents, the Keiths,enter, with a birthday card for 
JK 
431 DJ is 32 yesrs old; so is JK, as of today. 
445 I tell the Keiths what we're doing; ask DJ about 
his memories of highschool 
454 DJ thinks first of some injuries; then of work he did; 
they worked with horses up until DJ was well into 
high school; he rememberd the hard winter of i960 
500 JK remembers the same hard winter, with no electric 
milking machines because of a power problem. 
527 DJ recalls how they were snowed in; and cutting trees 
in deep snow 
560 DJ started milking when he was 3 years old 
570 DJ's mother reminds him of a time the cow knowkkdhim into 
the manure trough and he swore at the covj, at age 3. 
630 Mrs. Keith tells how DJ had to take over most of the farm 
work when he was about 18: stock raising, crop growing, 
scything hay 
655 Working with horses was hard, working by hand was harder. 
683 One man cutting by hand might cut an acre or l| acres a day. 
700 DJ points out how much easier the work is with modern 
equipment, but he's not sold on round balers yet. 
745 Even though they have some new equipment, the Keiths still 
have all the hand and horse-drawn equipment: scythes, 
cradles, mowing machine , hay rakes, binders, drill, 
wagons, lime spreader 
770 Floyd Co. land is low in phosphorus, but otherwide good 
788 I ask Mr. -Keith about work swapping; there used to be more. 
Thrashing took about a wfefek, with a dozen men working 
together at each farm. 
823 JK points out that durigg thrashing, the women would have 
to make huge meals

PS: Memories of school, and playing horseshoes during

Playing mwsic at house dances; PS played not for public 
dances, but for invited dances, where the people are 
not so rowdy; the Korn Kutters don*t really play much 
in public 
RS doesn’t play anything, neither did her parents; PS's 
parents were good singers in church, and had an organ 
at home which PS*s sisters would play. Two older brothers 
played the harmonica 
Songs: "il Firm Foundation," "vrhat a Friend We Have in Jesus"

listened in; 
PS: the party line got to be too inconvenient

I ask about a cradle sitting on the floor; it was made by

might be used till a child was a year old, or too big- 
then a child would move into a trundle bed

Outline 
Story about a man who lost his leg and still felt 
pain, till the leg was reburied properly 
ES's uncle was not an undertaker, but he made coffins 
(out of wateroak) for years 
More about coffins and undertaking in the old days; 
a beautiful solid chestnut coffin made for a 
a neighbor woman 
The value of wormy chestnut is high nowadays; 
ES's son in law (Ernest Lee Jarvis) has a lot 
of wormy chestnut in the old log house down by 
the Little River 
ES and CS debate whether the house with the chestnut 
in it is a log house or a "weatherboarded house". 
ES: They're still building log houses, but differently;! 
"They used to hew their logs, a certain 
thickness, enough to get enough face on 'em, 
you know, that they could put one on top of the 
other. And they notched 'em at the ends, and 
they locked 'em in some way. And pegged 'em with 
pegs, bored a hole in there with an old bit, it 
just had a stick for a handle...." 
ES and CS explain: new log houses are solid wood 
(no chinking?) and use creosoted logs. 
ES has seen old log houses built; also refers to 
one which was used for a school when the residents 
built a new house 
ES and CS sometimes go to a family reunion at the 
old log schoolhouse; in fact, they lived there 
after they were married. 
The cabin had a kitchen extension, with a cellar

Index ■# Outline 
000 Continuation of ES’s response: Necessary buildings 
on an old farm are house, granary, barn. ES1s 
father’s farm also had a tenant house, lived in 
successively by ES’s older brothers and finally 
ES and CS. 
014 ES’s daddy also had a millhouse and a springhouse, 
with a"race" running through it, to keep 
milk and butter in; also canned goods. 
033 ES’s aunt made pickled beans "by the barrelful"; 
also kraut. "It was better up at her house than 
it was down at home." She (the aunt) would go 
into”that same springhouse that saved my 
grandpa's life in that flood—she’d go in there 
to get pickled beans or kraut out for dinner, 
you know. Us young un’s'd just follow right 
along after. She'd just give us a double handful, 
like that, and we'd just walk out and go to 
eatin' it like a pig eatin' out of a trough!" 
050 ES's daddy's millhouse contained a mill, run by 
a small engine. A spark from the engine 
ignited the granary, adjacent, and burned it. 
083 Story about ES's cousin living in W. Va., who regclarlj 
requested a barrel of molasses and returned the 
barrel to Vfest Jefferson. 
112 ES's family finally built a shelter over their 
syrup boiler; reminiscences of making syrup 
using horse and even steers to run the mill 
130 Steers getting drunk from circling around the cane- 
millj Everyone brought their cane to ES's 
father to have it milled; more on cane-milling 
and syrup-making; renting out the mill, which 
may have been among the first in the county.

The cane mill was an old time type, just a two- 
roller mill. 
CSs "If I had all the molasses that that mill has made, 
I*d be a millionaire." 
ES recalls plainting cane when they lived near Laurel 
Springs; "red clay makes pretty molasses." 
Dark soil makes dark-colored molasses. 
I mention shingles curling because of being put up 
during the wrong phase of the moon; ES enthusiastic¬ 
ally agrees, and cites some examples he knows; 
including a roof that was half shingled on the 
right phase and half on the wrong 
ES helped build that house, and they used nine loads of 
rock in it; it had a fireplace (double) in the 
middle, and two rooms. 
I ask about names for houses; ES and CS don’t know 
any, but describe several small types. "You can 
heat the house better if its (i.e., the chimney) 
in the middle of the house." 
I ask about the lack of fireplace in their upstairs 
east room; they say the room was probably never used, 
since the house vias owned by a man, wife, and one son, 
who owns it now and for whom ES is working: 
Mac Garamet Higgins. 
ES and CS don’t know why the Higgins built such a big 
house, and all with hand-dressed lumber. 
The pine rosin in the ceiling boards prevent a 
paint job from looking clean for very long; it 
looks like fly-specks, and ES tells about' the 
last time it was painted. 
ES points out some plane marks. "People, back when 
this was built, there wan’t no jobs. People’d 
gang in and help one another." 
More about sharing work: in cutting winter’s wood, or 
shucking corn. But they don't swap work any more.

was at it; picking the dirt out of the wool 
in the wintertime

wool — before picking or after; then ES 
describes the rest of the sequence 
Spinning wool on a large wheel; how she did it. 
Other chores: feeding chickens, milking, churning, 
making butter 
Keeping the livestock in an old log barn, with 
two stalls, made of lumber, and a lean-to

of Ed and Carrie Severt, Rt. 18, Alleghany Co., 
reminiscences 
ES In the midst of a story about a hailstorm 
which beat the roof off of a small shed used 
to "batch" in by a married man; the shed is 
described, as viere the feet of two boys out 
walking in the storm: "and their little feet 
was just as red as turkey snouts!" 
The hailstorm was so severe it killed people’s 
cows and a patch of white pine timber. 
Many churches had their roofs beaten off by the hail. 
ES discusses the establishment of the Calvary 
Baptist church, overlooking Glendale. 
ES and CS also used to go to "Old Meadow Fork"; 
they describe the location (Cf. Drawing I) 
ES explains the changes in the church building; 
it was moved from a site closer to the highway, 
and in the process, it was turned so that the 
original front end faced the cemetery. ES 
"got on ’em" about it, and made them nail up 
the front door, making it a window, and cut 
the back window into a new front door. 
ES wants them to cover up the window nearest the 
cemetery, because it prevents one from seeftg 
the preacher 
ES: "I’ve heard some real preaching right there." 
Meadow Fork was an old church. 
ES tells about how they first went to Meadow Fork 
church in work clothes; now he has for suits, 
but doesn’t go to church because of a doctor’s 
admonition to stay out of crowds. CS, in the 
background, says "I think that’s Wb«-h*s the

his second wife, wanted to bury him in Ashe 
Co., at the Old Riverview Church. 
ES: Story about "old man Congressman Bob Doughton" 
and "old man Jess Miller", who got sick, and 
ES had to go to the army. The story wanders, 
and other characters are brought in, including one 
who fought with his wife, and another who wrecked 
a car and killed Avery Ashley, who might or might 
not be kin to Doc Ashley up at Sparta. ES continues 
in this gossipy vein through several more characters. 
I ask if ES ever knew any Woody’s? Yes, they did. 
I explain that I will be seeing some Woody's there.

RW: 
Life was tough. 21 families were living at 
the Woody house after th 1916 flood. 
The 1916 flood: RW describes it. 
This area had fewer trees in 1916 than it does now 
Linda Woody Overwater Interrupts to say that they 
only use the trees for firewood now 
RW: Story about a family who lost their father during 
the flood. 
RW was four years old in 1916. Tomorrow is his 
birthday, i.e., Sept. 27. 
I ask about birthday pranks and birthday celebrations; 
LW explains what they do; I ask about 
nose-buttering; they've never heard of it. 
Story about going to school at Peak Creek, and 
the punishment for bad kids: stick your nose in 
a hole in the wall. 
LW begins to show be some family photos of her 
grandparents: Alexander Woody 
We speculate about the dates of the photos, and 
they identify various relatives. 
JW: Story about RW's uncle Noah — but we are diverted 
by more guesses as to who is whom in the photos 
JW: Finally, the story about Noah, who was shot 
by a would-be girlfirends brother 
I ask how long the Woodys have been here; the land 
has been in the family for over a hundred years 
Cheryl and Robin (RW's granddaughters) come in, and 
are introduced; Cheryl clarifies the ID on the 
photos, which she wrote 
JW begins to explain the family's tie with the land 
LW says the oldest family member in the area was 
Jackson Woody, who was there "back in the 1700's "

JVf mentions a family genealogy written by a relative, 
tracing changes in the name: Vfoode—Woodee—Woodie— 
Woody. Today there are-just the latter two around. 
I remark on the amount of family records; JW says her 
d-in-law actually has it all at her house 
I clarify what I’m after, and ask Mr. Woody to begin 
telling me about himself. I also change mikes, from 
omni to cardioid. 
RW: How they came to build on the hill; finding the site 
by seeing where the cows stood to keep warm. 
JW was from Califormia; RW was born 150 yards from 
where we are sitting, in a house built by his Dad; 
The house was three stories, had four fireplaces; RW 
talks about how they helped each other. I ask for 
a diagram of the house, and RW begins to draw one. 
(Cf. Notes, for appended diagram) 
RW: Story about keeping the road clear with dynamite. 
Around 1900, the road was changed, and so the house 
had to be rearranged too: "They tore out the 
kitchen, see, the kitchen faced that way. Uh, 
towards the road, and there was a big fireplace 
and a chimney, and about a twenty-by-twenty, up 
and downstairs." I ask for clarification, and RW 
adds to the drawing 
RW and I together draw the diagram and figure out the 
house; note the "medicine rooms" enclosed on the 
porch: "That's what we dalled 'em when we were 
kids, because, you know— 'course I don't remember 
too much, but v/hen my Daddy died, there was thousands 
of bottles of medicine, and Mom used to always say, 
"Don't touch any of that medicine, it might be 
poison." 
RW: 
JW: 
RW's father doctored a lot of people and animals locally, 
using a book and medicines and roots and herbs. 
Story about how his older brother cut off his fingers 
accidentally and his Mother put them back on, and 
they healed -v&l. Followed by a story about a friend 
who cfiit off a finger, went to the doctor, and the 
doctor threw it away. 
Story about another bad injury cured by RW's mother, 
whose name was Betty. RW's father: Leander Woody, 
who was much older than Betty. 
RW: Mother used to tell stories — ghost stories, and 
stories about mad wolves. 
RW mentions a book by Wilburn Waters, who wrote about 
Wilkes Co. 
The family (after RW’s Dad died) consisted of his 
mother, his aunt, her daughter, his grandmother, and 
the young kids (himself and his brothersseven kids 
s n. 
RW: 
BR8-T71-R36, continued 
The family kids were all boys: RW and six brothers. 
LW tells briefly about an accident that happened to 
the youngest brother, perhaps the fault of a baby¬ 
sitter— the brother ultimately di£d. 
RW clarifies: the way he .heard it, the boy (who was 
really born long before RW) fell out of a 2nd story 
window. 
The house foundation was big locust posts, "and you 
could walk right under the lower side." 
LW points out that the boards lasted a long time; they 
had been reused in a house that burned down two 
winters ago. 
RW: The old timbers were hewn, not sawed out. "They had 
timbers in there that was over forty feet long, 
this spruce pine." 
RW's father built the house, the father died at the 
age of 51, in 1915 (born in 1857); RW guesses 
that the house was built between 1875-1880. 
Leander and Betty had twelve kids in all: 9 boys, of 
whom one died, leaving eight; plus three girls. 
RW: Large families used to be quite usual; story aabout 
a man named Lon White who had many kids and put them 
all to work in the fields. Sometime during the 
1920*s, Mrs. White hoed corn, had a baby, went 
home and cooked supper. 
LW brings up the "Andy Long" house, which everyone 
agrees is much older: RW’s father was born there. 
It is very old, has suffered from vandalism, and 
is out in the woods. Also an old cemetery, with 
names of the old families in the area: Millers, 
Woodys. Bears, and Coxes. 
I ask about the Andy Long cabin; they describe it, 
it is a basic Anglo-American cabin unit, sketched 
on the same sheet as RW’s sketch.

Living in the .Andy Long house - eight in a bed; 
the house was in good shape. 
016 
Andy Long had a horse, and he used to go to 
Vfilkesboro and back in a week; Andy Long 
was still alive 16 years ago,and then he 
and his wife died in their 80*s 
035 
LVf says the house could be fixed up, because it’s 
far off the load; RVf describes the location, 
which was in a valley. 
The house used to be paper inside with newspapers 
for added warmth (stuck on with cornstarch). 
Disposition of the Andy Long houses bought by an 
heir, whose son bought it from him; the 
Vfoody’s talk about how they wish they could 
have had it to restore; the present owner only 
comes up during deer season 
RVf: Vfe all left home to make some money, because we 
had none. Gathering beadwood leaves, digging 
coonroot or poke or sassafras and trading it 
to the store for a "due bill", which could be 
exchanged for snuff, candy, coffee. 
I ask about the roots and herbs: poke, says RVf, to 
make medicine; Coonroot and ginseng; Beadwood 
leaves used to bring Ig-^/lb. and now its 655^/lb. 
People now make up to $20/day picking it. 
More on beadwood leaves: drying them in a barn or 
in a spare room upstairs.

Dried apples for pie 
JW mentions the Reddies River, which is south of 
the Woody's home, and runs into the Yadkin 
I explain the dimensions of our study area. 
The Woodys' have five springs on their property, one 
of which is the source of the Reddies 
LW mentions how many springs there are around Laurel 
Springs; RW says they're still using the same 
source of water as the old house: the old spring. 
Memories of fetching water from the spring in the old 
house; no outhouse in the old house. 
Wind blowing through knotholes in the floor, and no 
insulation in the old house: "You had to be tough. 
I remember my grandmother taking a snuff-box lid 
and tacking over a hole." 
RW: Story about how he and a brother broke a window and 
it snowed into their room. Running through the 
snow barefoot. 
RW: "Everything you ate, you had to get it yourself." 
And no leftovers. Putting the cows on a diet during 
the lean part of winter. 
RW's mother used to say: "Tale big bites of corn bread and 
little sips of milk!" 
RW: "That'w what we were raised on, corn bread and milk." 
Squirrel-hunting for breakfast: squirrel, gravy, biscuits 
or corn bread. Eggs, but not often, becasue they 
could be swapped at the store. 
Deer were not available till recently (the last 20 years). 
RW: "Our mainstay was squirrel or rabbit in the wintertimei1’! 
Making squirrel and gravy. 
Typical dinner and supper: Canned foods (beans, tomatoes) 
apple sauce. Corn bread and beans a mainstay. 
Several hundred |gal. cans full of home canned food. 
The cans were stored in the Woody kitchen, and several 
times it got so cold the cans would freeze and bust. 
RW: "We had absolutely nothing, I mean we didn't have a 
dime as far as money goes. But we had everything." 
RW remembers old time music: Guitars, banjos, fiddles, 
square dancing in the old houses big west room. 
RW: Story about cousin Edna who would stand so close 
to the fire her legs would get red. 
I adjust the microphone to better pick upRW. 
Clarification of family life and RW*s boyhood. At 15 
years old, he left and went to V/. Va., where a 
sister was living. He planned to go to Ciiveland 
with his brothers, but they snuck off and left him. 
More travels of RW: To Ohio at age 17, staying with 
brothers and sister working for Willard Storage 
batteries (General Motors); RW kept house for them. 
pS; fre smarter; we were dumb and uneducated.

RW and JW met in Ohio 
How they met; married in New York; return to N.C.; 
then they moved to California, and were followed out 
Vfest by most of the other brothers, ultimately; 
then they came back to RVf’s hometo retire. 
RVf is the only one of his immediate family to return 
here. RW: Story about how JW loved the view when 
she first saw it, but it was old hat to him. 
RW's first visit away from the Peak Creek/Laurel Springs 
area, to North Wilkesboro; riding with the mailman, 
taking his first train-ride. 
The Woody's lived for forty years in California, 
returned in 1959 and built the house in 1961. 
LW and JW discuss the heaviest winter (of i960), 
which they missed. 
I ask about the movement of people: RW says the young 
people are staying now; in his day, everyone left 
as soon as they could. 
RW says many of his generation are coming back to 
retire, though they had to leave to make a living. 
LW says when they got here, there was no one in school 
their age. 
RW mentions a first cousin,, one of three Woody's who 
marrie d three Miller sisters 
RW talks about how much things change, and how old 
people get crabby and set in their ways. RW's sister 
visited a few years ago, and was disappointed 
because of all the changes. 
JW: "Fifteen years ago, when we came here, it was 
almost like it was in 1935> when we first came here. 
Fifteen years ago it was still like that." 
Differences between the generations: RW: the old 
generation grew up with shortages of money and 
goods; the younger thinks money grows on trees. 
RW: "We didn't even know there was a Depression. It 
wasn't any different here." (Durig the Depression, 
RW and brothers were living in Ohio).

RW: Price of food when he was young; Linda 
V/oody made homemade butter which sold for 
10^/pound; she molded it in her hands. 
Buying butter from a neighbor or relative. 
The V/oody* s had four cows to be milked 
The older boys would leave home; several went to 
Greensboro to work in cotton mills, and they 
would send home bolts of cloth, from whkh 
RV/*s aunt would make clothes for the boys: 
pants, shirts, underwear, overalls. 
LW asks for clarification of the relation 
RW: Story about the time he chased a neighbor's 
turkeys just to see them fly 
It took, off and on, a year to pay back the turkeys 
RW: Story about how his brother wantonly killed 
the frog; in RW*s frog pond. 
So RW shot his brother's chickens, then hid in 
a cherry tree. The brother called out" There's 
a bear in that cherry tree, I'm going to 
shoot him." So RW gave up to him. 
RW begins to reminisce about pranks played at 
school. How he burned up a desk; his 
pet- blacksnake, and how it surprised a 
passenger in his car 
How RW left the snake in the mailbox for the 
mailman to find; never copperheads or rattlers 
(which RW used to catch, too) but the black- 
snake. 
I ask about Halloween pranks and customs: RW: 
Pumpkins, trick-and-treating, but for a 
trick they put a buggy on top of a woodshed 
BR8-TA-R38, continued 
320 RVf also cut down trees to block the school buses; 
325 RW: Another prank; stirring up the hornets in the 
path of the tanbark wagon 
358 JW: RW's mother had several opportunities to remarry, 
but these were spiked by the kids' pranks, esp. 
one (related by RV/) when RW's brother Arch ran 
off with a suitor's horse. 
393 Ihe Woodys show me some family photos and mementos 
from Cleveland; 
419 JV/'s feelings about the Blue Ridge: she loved the 
lush green color after California's dryness. They 
feel they have seen Los Angeles grow during their 
forty years there. 
4-53 RW had a business in Lawndale, and he had an average 
of three break-ins a week. In N.C., they don't 
have to lock the doors. 
483 LW points out that tourists are scared of the mountains, 
and few of them waiLd venture as far back as the 
Woody house. 
520 RW says he can't take the kind of living he had in 
California, because he's too old. 
536 LW felt California urban life was too restrictive. 
546 JW: Story about A1 Capone coming to California and 
being told to stay on the train and not come in 
to Los Angeles; so they went to Florida 
574 The population of Laurel Springs is 500. 
583 Watching the tourists drive through Laurel Springs and 
back again, look! ng for the town and hoping for 
a MCDonal&s. 
604 RW talks about relatives who have material wealth but 
no satisfaction because of living in a rat race. 
636 Cheryl Woody comes in (she is RW and JW's oldest son's 
daughter) and points out the differences between 
her social life in California schools and in N.C. 
6?0 Why LW hated schools in California: the impermanence 
of individuals. Here they know everybody. 
700 JW brings in a typescript-copy of the Woody genealogy, 
beginning a discussion of local relations and 
local families. 
738 RW: All the homes in here belonged to Woodys when I 
was a boy. 
768 RW recalls the flu epidemic of 1918, and how he 
threw a bucket of water on a sick brother that 
he thought was "possuming."

I ask for an old ghost story: RW mentions "Booger 
Holler"

and being afraid to come back past Booger Holler; 
how he was scared by his own mother 
RW: Story about his oldest brother who encountered 
a tree that shook by itself. 
RW: My grandmother used to tell stories about Indians, 
about Cherokees; Story about her as a little 
girl — or perhaps her mother — whose husband 
buried gold coins on the land and was then killed 
by Indians. And you could hear the sound of 
money pouring into a dishpan around the valley 
where this was supposed to have happened. 
RW: Another thing that hafcpenedto his grandmother’s 
mother: she was abducted by Indians at the age 
of seven or eight, and she escaped by hiding in 
a hollow chestnut log, and lived till she was 98. 
RW: Another story about Wilburn Waters, who was a 
great hunter: how he got on the back of a wounded 
bear and rode it towards a cliff and killed it 
just before it would have plunged off. 
I ask Cheryl about Booger Hollow; she heard of it 
from RW, and had heard some of the stories RW

it at night. RW: It's a family landmark. 
RW: Playing a trick on some guests: imitating a ghost 
at Booger Holler.

see a man with no head. 
JW: RW’s recently deceased- aunt, who died at the age 
of 97> used to say all those stories were true. 
RW says he can't remember the old stories, his memory 
is not good, because he had a stroke last fall. 
RW: We'd listen to stories in a big circle around the 
fireplace, and get scared when we went outside to 
go upstairs to go to bed. 
RW describes how the house's hall was open at the ends 
for a time; Story about how a ball of lightning 
went through once 
Going to bed: feeling your way in the dark; heating a 
brick to heat the bed; setting the bed on fire with 
a heated brick on a straw tick. 
Some people had feather beds.
