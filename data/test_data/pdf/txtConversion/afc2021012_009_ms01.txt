CT: Okay, we've started recording. So I'm going to go ahead and read my introduction here.  
Today is February 21, 2022. This is an interview for the Custodians and Janitors in Colorado Oral 
History Project funded by an Archie Green fellowship from the Library of Congress. As part of 
the project, we are interviewing people employed in the janitorial field to record their stories, 
document their skills and knowledge, and better understand their important role in our 
communities. The recording and transcript will become a permanent part of the collection at 
the Library of Congress. We are recording. My name is Cynthia Torres, and we are recording in 
Colorado. The time is approximately 1:30 PM. For the record, do you give us permission to 
record your story? 
MK: Yes. 
CT: And could you tell us your name and the year you were born? 
MK: I'm Michael Kozemchak and I was born in 1993. 
CT: Okay. And your current job title? 
MK: I'm a custodian. 
CT: Fantastic. Okay. We're gonna get started with the questions and again, let me know if you 
want to stop or pause or anything like that. How long have you been working as a custodian? 
MK: Actually, almost two years. I started as a temp {temporary employee] back in February, at 
the end of February of 2020. 
CT: Could you tell me a little bit--we’ll start out with some of your history? Only share what 
you're comfortable with. Could you tell me a little bit about your early life and family? Where 
were you born and how did you end up in Colorado? 
MK: Well, I was born in Virginia. My family's been moving around, moves around a lot. We 
actually moved to Colorado when I was a kid. We moved away again. I moved back here 
because they moved here. And I've fallen in love with the place basically.  
CT: Well, very nice. And how did you come to be a custodian? 
MK:  I worked as a line cook at various restaurants. I hated every second of it. I did that for five 
years. Eventually, I just like went on a crisis looking for anything different. I found a temp 
agency was looking for somebody to work here and, and I love my job now, so, you know.  
CT:  Could you tell me a story from your early experience working as a custodian?  
MK: A story? Oh, I mean, I guess I'll talk about the first day. I wasn't used to driving in a city-like 
environment, you know, where there's just like parking meters everywhere. So, it was really

awkward. I parked in this parking garage, but only students are supposed to park there. I had to 
get it. My supervisor had to tell me where to move it. And I couldn't find--this was my first time 
going to CU Boulder. It looked like a city to me. I was amazed by it. You know, I had a little bit of 
trouble getting around, but I got used to it eventually, you know.. 
CT: And when you finally got clocked in, how was it? Was it--did it meet your expectations or--? 
MK: Oh, I mean, I was just excited--and the craziest ad, it looked so good and it met all the 
expectations. 
CT: Oh, fantastic. 
MK: That actually exceeds expectations. 
CT: Can you tell me about one of your most challenging or memorable days working as a 
custodian? 
MK: I think the most challenging of days was I was moved to a building that had more--I had 
just been moved to this new building and it snowed. And so I guess I had trouble getting 
everything on the list done in addition to getting, having to shovel all the snow and all that.  
CT: And what about COVID has been the most challenging for you as a custodian, and how has 
it impacted you and/or your family? 
4:23 
MK: Well, I was actually let go. I remember CU Boulder got rid of their temps for a while, but 
because of COVID, about a few months later though, I was contacted by my current supervisor 
who told me that there was a job opening that I could apply for. So that's awesome. But that's 
the most challenging aspect of COVID. That was the most challenging aspect of COVID for me. 
CT: Did your job change a lot from what you were used to? 
MK: Not really.  
CT: That’s wonderful. Were you nervous at all about COVID? 
MK: Oh, I was definitely nervous when they got rid of me, because I wasn't sure if they were 
gonna take me back eventually, or if I was going to have to go back to working as a line cook 
(laughs). 
CT: I'm glad you got back. 
MK: Yeah, me too. 
CT: What do you like to do when you're not working? 
Transcription: Michael Kozemchak

MK: I like to try different youth things. I game a lot. I hang out at the bar with my friends a lot. 
Sometimes I'll do like ice skating, hiking, something like that. I like to go to Meetup. I used to go 
like to go to Meetup groups a lot, but I haven't been doing that a lot lately, but I'm still 
exploring new things, you know. 
CT: But there are a lot of changes, challenges, or is it different every day at work? Kind of like 
similar? 
MK: It's pretty much similar. And unless they move me to floors or [another] building, but I'm 
familiar with where I work now. 
CT: And what aspect about your work or working as a custodian, are you most proud of? 
MK: I'm always most proud when I walk into an area that's been completely trashed and 
they've used up all the paper towels or something. And then like, I slowly just make it spotless 
and restock everything. And then I know that I've made the difference, you know.  I always love 
that. 
CT: A sense of accomplishment.  And what's the biggest challenge of your job working as a 
custodian? 
MK: The biggest challenge: there's those days where people stay late and I can't do a room or I 
have to do a room really late, and I'm almost out of time to get everything done. That's the 
most challenging aspect, I would say 
CT: Just the pressure of meeting the demand? 
MK: Or like sometimes--normally it's not too fast-paced or anything like that, but there are 
some times where I can't do a certain something because people are there and I'd wait for 
them. And I'm like doing it last minute. 
CT: As far as interacting, like when, when you're working around a lot of people, how is that as 
far as getting your job done, is that stressful or is it…? 
MK: Well, I don't like to bother people who are in classrooms while studying or whatever, 
especially when I'm operating something like the vacuum cleaner or the fog machine, because 
those can be pretty loud. I was actually using the fog machine once and somebody came out of 
a room. I didn't know they were there and they asked me, “Hey, you're being pretty loud and 
I'm trying to study in here. Can you, you know?”  
 7:59 
CT: The fog machines. Did those come about…? 
Transcription: Michael Kozemchak

MK: The fog machine? It's this little blue machine that just sprays like this fog, I guess, that kills 
COVID if it's around or whatever.  
CT: It's got to be handy rather than maybe hand washing everything. 
MK: Oh, yes. 
CT: Could you tell us a little bit about the people you've worked with over the years and that 
could be your co-workers, or you know, maybe folks that you've met up in the buildings that 
you've been in? 
MK: Is that just here or my whole working life or? 
CT: Well, let's start with right now and then maybe you can do a comparison. 
MK: Okay. I mean, they're mostly pretty cool people. I get along with everybody. They talk 
about each other sometimes and there's a little bit of drama in that regard, but it's nothing like 
I've experienced in the past, you know?  
CT: And what, what kinds of things are you referring to? 
9:12  
MK: Experience in the past? I’m talking about in my past as a line cook, I met some of the 
craziest people, drug addicts. There's this guy--I used to work at PF Changs, there's this guy that 
kept saying that he was going to leave and start his own business. He still works there. There's a 
girl named, well, I'm not going to go and be too specific here.  
CT: (laughs) But the folks that you work with now, I mean, are all different ages or different 
cultures and everything. 
MK: Yes. 
CT: Very nice. 
MK: It's interesting. 
CT: And what's as far as you personally, what's the biggest challenge that you've had to 
overcome in your life? 
MK: Biggest challenge. I guess going from where I started, because I'm not, I don't have a 
university education or any particular handy skills. So I've been working low paying jobs for a 
while. And then I guess my biggest challenge was working from that to where I am now.  
CT: What was that transition like…?  
Transcription: Michael Kozemchak 
 
5 
MK: It was pretty gradual, but, what I learned to do was like to be able to leverage my past 
experiences and the things I've learned--how to present myself on a resume, that kind of thing.  
CT: For your job, are there trainings that you can go through, like for professional development 
or just different or ways to learn even outside your…? 
MK: I've heard that there is. I haven't looked too much into it. 
CT: Okay. And another personal one. Could you tell me a little bit about a time when you 
needed to have courage? 
MK: Courage. I looked this up beforehand. The best story I have for this is one of the buildings. 
The basement has a bad bug problem, and I've seen that. So one time I saw the biggest 
cockroach I had ever seen in my life coming down the hallway and I immediately--I don't like 
bugs. I immediately left and I was like, I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that. But then I figured, 
you know, I have to get rid of it. So I guess I had to have courage and get rid of it.  
CT: Do you see any other things that are disturbing when things that maybe would set you off in 
the setting at work or anything? 
MK: Not really. 
CT: Okay. Good. Who was the person or people who inspires you to be the best person that you 
could be? 
MK: I would say I get my sense of right and wrong and my work… what's it called? (cross talk) 
Like a work ethic. Yeah. Work ethic. From my parents. Because they're good workers. They're 
strong workers, you know?  
CT: What was, what would you mind me asking what their professions are or… 
13:00 
MK: My step-dad works in a warehouse. My mother works. She does audits. I don't remember 
what my father does. But they're not slackers at all there. They've always worked hard.  
CT: Like work a lot of hours or show up on time? 
MK: Worked a lot of hours. And you know, always did what they were supposed to do. Always 
came in when they were needed.  
CT: And you're an essential employee, so you have to be here no matter what. 
MK: Right. Yeah. (laughs) 
CT: How is that challenging at all sometimes? 
Transcription: Michael Kozemchak 
 
6 
MK: Sometimes definitely. When the roads are really bad because of the snow. There's been 
times when we were told not to show up because it snowed too much. But I distinctly 
remember one time there was a blizzard. I mean, I'm not sure if it's classified as a blizzard, but I 
swear it snowed more that day than the day that we were told not to come in. And we were 
told to come in on that day and I remember driving here. My car is not built for the snow at all. 
That was all kinds of fun. 
CT: But you came in. 
MK: Yeah, I did. I did. Made it to work. 
CT: Fantastic. Thank you for doing that.  
What are you most proud of related to what you've created in your life?  
MK: Most proud of? What I’ve created. 
CT: What you've been able to achieve or create.  
MK: I mean, I'm working on a novel. It's not done. I've been working on it for a while, but… 
CT: Oh, a what? 
MK: A novel. 
CT: A novel. 
MK: Yes. 
CT: Fantastic. 
15:02 
MK: It's a, it's like a future dystopian, but there's a fantasy element. It's going to be interesting. 
(laughs) 
CT: How did you get started writing? 
MK: I was always told I was a good writer by like all of my teachers all throughout school. And 
then I liked the idea of--I would create stories in my head and I just liked the idea and I figured, 
Hey, I might as well put this onto something, you know? 
CT: Wonderful.  Do you mind me asking what it's about--? 
MK: Well, it's kind of complicated, but it's in the future and a corporation kind of owns much of 
the world. There's these creatures that are swarming and attacking people and this corporation

has mercenaries that handle the situation. But they need something else to fight these--they're 
basically giant bugs. So they discover that there's these people that know magic and they start 
the experiment where they try and get volunteers to try and learn how to do magic, to fight the 
giant bugs. So that's what it's about.  
CT: It's interesting that you're fighting giant bugs when you've talked about-- 
MK: Oh, right, right. That they're unrelated, but okay.  
CT: That’s awesome. Do you have an idea of a timeline of when you might complete that…? 
MK: I have no idea when I'm gonna finish. 
CT:  Ongoing? 
MK: Ongoing project.  
CT: What advice would you give someone starting out as a custodian? 
MK: Just basically, do what you can when you can, and manage your time. That's it. (laugh) 
CT: Is there any advice in general that you would give to young people starting out in life with 
similar experiences as you? 
MK: I wanted to get out of line cooking for so long, but I never really took an effort to try and 
get out of it. And all I really did to get to where I am now is put in just that much more effort, 
that little bit of extra effort, that little bit of extra effort can make all the difference. Sometimes 
not, sometimes it's not too much, just a little bit, you know. 
CT: When you talked about this job meets your expectations, or exceeds your expectations, 
what aspects about it exceeds your expectations? 
 18:10 
MK: I mean the benefits definitely. I get weekends off now. I get sick days and vacation days 
paid. I think that's awesome. Considering the jobs I was working before.   
CT: Could you walk me through like a typical day? We’ve gone through some of the questions 
that I’ve had here, but I would just like a typical day. Like when you're working, is there time to 
think, you know, about your novel, you know, when you’re doing something? 
MK: Oh, yes. It's not very fast-paced, like I said before, but you just got to make sure you do 
everything. There's plenty of time to do everything. It's just you have to work around classes, or 
people coming in late, that kind of thing. So a typical day, I come in, I normally do the 
bathrooms first, then the trash. I do the classrooms, like in between when I see there's nobody 
in them. And then at the end of the night, I do the floors and vacuum and all of that.

CT: Does the routine help you with your creativity? Because it seems like just from what you've 
said, you're a creative person. 
MK: Yeah. There's definitely a lot of time to think (laughs). While I'm doing it.  
CT: If somebody's not aware of what it's like to be a custodian or a janitor, how would you 
describe what that life is like? 
20:07 
MK: What the life is like? 
CT: Interacting with people who aren't custodians and everything either. Do you feel like you 
get treated well or, you know, you interact with the people that you're providing a service for? 
MK: Oh, they definitely treat me well. Like really well. I won't go into specifics, but they're 
always very kind to me. 
CT: And what are your hopes for--because you're pretty young--what are your hopes for the 
future? Do you intend to just continue on in the position you're in and because it seems like 
you have these external interests that your position is really allowing you to? 
MK: Right. Well, at one point I wanted to be, to learn a skill that would allow me to work 
remotely. And now I'm not so sure about that. I've never been able to focus on anything 
specific for my future. Right now I'm trying to find somewhere I could start as a bar back, and 
then work my way to be a bartender, like as a side thing. I definitely want to finish my 
education. The last classes I took were for accounting, so we'll see what happens. But yes, 
there's no specific goal. Honestly. 
CT: Do you have tuition reimbursement or any kind of education benefits? 
MK: From what I've heard here, you get nine free credit hours.  I mean, it's significant, I guess, 
but you have to first get accepted here. Right now, I'm just studying at a community college.  
CT: Well, we've gone through all the questions and everything and I appreciate you answering 
them and being a part of this interview. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about where 
you'd like to share with people, to know a little bit more about you and the folks who are in 
your position, similar positions as you? 
MK:  Like I said, if you're somewhere you don't want to be, keep going and keep looking for 
opportunities to get somewhere you'd like to be. 
CT: Very nice. That's great advice. Just a little bit more.  
Well, we're done if you've had the opportunity to say everything you'd like to say.

MK: I have. 
CT: Fantastic. Okay. We'll go ahead and conclude the interview. Thank you so much. 
MK: Of course.
