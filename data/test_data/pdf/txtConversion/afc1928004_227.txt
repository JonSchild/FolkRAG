HARRY OSBORNE'S NEW CHARACTER SONGSTER. 
Dedicated to his sincere friend, 
JAMES E. NOLAN, 
Banjoist and Balladist. 
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 
HARRY OSBORNE, the favorite and young comedian, whom it 
gives us pleasure in introducing most favorably to the general 
public, is a 
native of this soil, having been born in Railway, 
N. J., in the year 1854. 
He is however of English and Irish ex-
traction, his father, H. 
E. Osborne, being well-known as an Eng-
lish actor of merit and distinction. 
Our youthful and popular 
comedian commenced his professional career in 1868, in con-
junction with the Andrew Glassford Dramatic Company, of 
which Pauline Cushman was the leading star. 
During the 
years 1869 and 1870 he entered into an engamement with Mr. 
Albert Aiken to perform in his famous drama, " The Witches 
of New York." 
In the next year Mr. Osborne engaged with 
Barnum's company, but was soon forced to dissever his connec-
tions with it by reason of ill health. 
Subsequently, be joined 
the Bloodgood Minstrels; but, in 1872 was re-engaged by Mr. 
Albert Aiken to sustain the character of Adolphus Lawrence, in 
which part he attained great popularity at the South. 
Shortly 
after, Mr. Osborne entered upon a 
new field as a 
comedian and 
vocalist in company with James M. Ward, Joseph Emmet, Amy 
Stone, Jenny Morton, and others. 
Recently, however, this 
gifted son of Mornus has devoted himself to comic vocalism, and 
his success has been commensurate to his industry, energy, and 
natural talents. 
He is at present attached to the Nichols and 
Woodruff's Glass-blowers and Concert Troupe, and is a 
decided 
favorite with their friends and patrons wherever they perform.

Ttiz GREEN LITTLE SHAMROCK 
There's a 
dear little plant that grows in our isle, 
'Twas Si-. 
Patrick himself, sure, that set it, 
And the sun on his labor with pleasure did smile, 
And with dews from his eyes oft did wet it. 
It thrives through the bog, through the brake, through 
the mireland, 
And he called it the dear litt/e shamrock of Ireland. 
CHORUS. 
The sweet little shamrock, the dear little shamrock, 
The sweet little, green little shamrock of Ireland. 
This dear little plant still grows in our land, 
Fresh and fair as the daughters of Erin, 
Whose smiles can bewitch, whose voice eni command 
In each climate that each shall appear in, 
And shine through the bog, through the brake, thr.,ttgli 
the mireland, 
Just like their own dear little shamrock of Ireland. 
The sweet little shamrock, &c. 
This dear little plait that springs from our soil, 
When its three little leaves are extended, 
Denotes from one stalk we together should toil, 
And ourselves by ourselves be befriended. 
And still through the bog, through the brake, thr-u h 
the mireland, 
From one root should branch the shamrock of Ireland.

I'LL MEET YOU ON BROADWAY. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1374, by E. 11. ElsisniNo, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
Words and Music by GEO. G. Haim 
Arranged by R. 
STEIRLY. 
The Music of this Song is published by E. H. HAnortio, 288 Bowery, New, 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
THE dearest thing to me in life ' midst all my pleasures gay, 
Is when my darling girl I 
meet, and to me she does say, 
I 
can't stay now, my dearest George; I've been too long away, 
But at half past four this afternoon, I'll meet you on Broadway. 
CHORI:S. 
Yes, I'll meet you on Broadway, my dear, 
I'll meet you on Broadway; 
At half past four o'clock P. M., 
I'll meet you on Broadway. 
I 
dress myself with usual care, cravat and gloves to match, 
And at the pretty girls I 
stare; they think me " quite a 
catch," 
There's nothing troubles me at all—my heart is light and gay, 
And at half past four o'clock P. M. you'll see me on Broadway. 
Yes, I'll meet you, etc. 
And now it's time to say good bye; I 
can no longer stay; 
The best of friends must part I'm told, at least that's what they 
say; 
But if you wish to see me more let me appoint the day, 
To-morrow afternoon at four 
meet you on Broadway. 
Yes, I'll meet you, etc. 
ENOUGH IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST. 
Words by J. 
B. 
GEOGHEGAN. 
Music by J. 
BATCEiRLDER. 
As I 
ramble the city, I 
often reflect 
On the bustle and and toil we endure, 
And think what a 
life of confusion and strife, 
There is in this world to be sure ; 
No matter the ca'ling, condition or age, 
From the loftiest down to the least, 
They all seek more gold, tho' the proverb of old 
Says enough is as good as a 
feast. 
7 
CHORUS. 
The saying is trite, 
But ' tis none the less right, 
For however your store is increased, 
You will leave it behind, 
So bear this in your mind, 
That enough is as good as a 
feast. 
What folly to envy your neighbor his wealth, 
When perhaps if his secrets were known, 
lie's so much to pay for his wants ev'ry day, 
That his riches are less than your own ; 
Should your income be small, make your outgoings less, 
You'll have one consolation at least, 
When you lay down to rest you can say with the best, 
I've enough, that's as good as a 
feast. 
The saying is trite, etc. 
How oft will the reveller riot in wine, 
Till of sense he is fairly bereft, 
And the juice once so full, grows insipid and dull, 
And he's scarcely a 
happiness left; 
lie's a 
plague to himself and a 
shame to his friends, 
And in reason is worse than a 
beast, 
For the veriest ass that e'er nibbled the grass, 
Knows enough is as good as a 
feast. 
The saying is trite, etc. 
Then think on the maxim and follow the rule; 
It's meaning to all will apply; 
It would suit even fame did it honor your name, 
But fame never comes till you die; 
lie is not the most happy who owns the most gold, 
Nor be the worst off that owns least; 
If you think you've enough, tho' your table be rough, 
Why, enough is as goed as a 
feast. 
The Eaying is trite, etc.

THE CHARCOAL MAN. 
Composed by VirELLING, and Sung with great success by HARRY' OSBORNE. 
My name ' tis Danny Connor, I 
am a 
charcoal man, 
And if you will but listen you'll see I 
am an Irishman ; 
I 
was born in Dublin City, that place of great renown, 
But now I 
am here in America, peddling charcoal through the 
town. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, as I 
was walking down the main street I 
met 
one Paddy O'Hare and Paddy Flaherty. " Good morning, Din-
nie," says they. " Good morning, boys," says I. " Where are 
you going 7" says they. " Gorra, don't you see 7" says I. " I 
am making great preparations for the land of America. 
Will 
you come 7" says I. 
So with that we all started for the great 
city called Latherpole, but when I 
got there I 
found I 
had only 
money enough to pay two of their passages. " What will 
we do now l" says one of them, flaring up. " Wait awhile," 
says I, " till I 
subtract." 
So I 
began. 
Paddy from Paddy I 
couldn't, for that would lave one behind. I 
paid both of their 
passages anyway, and I 
went into a 
barrel myself, and they put 
me down in the hole of the ship, and when the ship began to 
go the barrel began to roll inside of the ship, and I 
began to 
roar inside of the barrel, and for three long weeks I 
was crying 
out---" Oh, Paddies, there is the devil's own roar inside of me." 
CHORITS. 
Charcoal is my cry ; I 
make the old horse get, 
And if he does go slow, you bet I'll use the whip. 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, her name was Rosie Ann, 
She said I 
was a 
genius, and she would have no other man; 
(1) 
11 
THE CHARCOAL MAN.—Continued. 
But now she is gone and left me for a 
fellow by the name of 
McGee, 
Who peddles sawdust round the corner, and my Rosie no more 
I 
see. 
SPOKEN.—When I 
landed here I 
was sent to a boarding 
house, and begorra they put me in bed with a 
nigger, and when 
they woke me up in the morning, I 
looked at myself in the 
glass, and what do you think, but me face was black. 
I 
sup-
pose some of them were after blacking it. 
Anyhow, I 
know 
that I 
went to the landlord, and tould him that they woke up 
the wrong man, for I 
am in bed yet. 
Charcoal is my cry, etc. 
One day they were out a-riding, and the horse he took a 
fright, 
He ran away with Rosie, and didn't sthop till night, 
They ran away up to Harlem Bridge, Rosie screamed with all 
her might; 
He upset the charcoal wagon and kicked Door Rosie out of 
sight. 
SPOKEN.—I 
wint down one day to the market, and there I 
saw the funniest kind of fish I 
ever saw. " What kind of fish 
do you call that, sar 7" says I. " Lobster, sar," says he ; " put 
your finger in there," meaning the claw of the lobster. " I 
wont, sar," says I; " but I 
have a 
dog here, and I'll put his tail 
in." 
So I 
put the dog's tail in the claw of the lobster, and the 
dog ran away with the lobster. " Say, young man," says he, 
" 
fishle back your dog." " I 
wont, sar," says I, " but do you 
ftshle back your lobster." 
Charcoal is my cry, etc.

THAT'S THE PROPER CAPER. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. II. IIArtruzio, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. c. 
I 
AM a 
man of easy mind, 
I 
know no care or woe, 
I 
make myself agreeable 
Wherever I 
may go; 
My friends 1 
count them by the score— 
The reason I 
will tell, 
I 
always do things properly, 
And consequently well. 
CHORD'S. 
That's the proper caper, that's the proper caper; 
When things are done in proper style, I 
always like to say, 
That's the proper caper, that's the proper caper; be fair and 
True in all you do, for that's the proper way. 
The other day I 
met a 
friend, 
A 
very nice young man; 
I 
asked him could he dine with me; 
Of course he said, I 
can; 
We dined and wined in sumptuous style, 
And smoked our Henry Clays; 
And when we parted he remarked, 
137 friend, I 
like your ways. 
That's the proper caper, etc. 
My sweetheart is a 
pretty girl, 
So lovely and so fair; 
Some day she's going to marry me, 
My future life to share; 
A 
rich young man was after her, 
But his love she could not see; 
She told him he was not the thing, 
She rather fancied me. 
That's the proper caper, etc. 
SUSAN JANE. 
Sung with great success by ROBERT JONES. 
I 
WENT to see my Susan; she met me at the door, 
She told me that I 
needn't come to see her any more! 
She fell in love with Rufus Andy Jackson Payne; 
I'm going to leave you soon; good-bye, Susan Jane. 
CHORUS. 
0, Susan Jane, 0, Susan Jane, 
0, Susan, quit your fooling, give your heart to me, 
Give me back my love again, and I 
will let you be; 
I 
used to love you dearly—I 
cannot love again; 
I 
am going away to leave you soon; good-bye, Susan Jane. 
Her mouth was like a 
cellar, her foot was like a 
ham, 
Her eyes were like an owl's at night, her voice was never 
calm, 
Her hair was long and curly, she looked just like a 
crane

BEHIND THE SCENES. 
Sung with great success by llama 0,BORNE. 
W REN but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy, 
To visit the theatre I'll admit ; 
How happy could I 
be, the performances to see, 
While seated in the gallery or pit; 
1 
fancied all was real that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have passed beyond my teens ; 
I 
begin to understand, tho' in front it may look grand, 
'Tis very different just behind the scenes; 
So if you will attend for a 
moment, now, my friend, 
I'll do the best within my humble means 
To show to you to-night tho' in front it may look bright, 
'Tis very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
His heart may yet rest heavy in his breast, 
And the man who plays the king tho' it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed ; 
The ladies too, so fair, who go floating through the air, 
And look like little angels there instead, 
Sometimes have to roam unto a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed; 
While those who play the parts of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends, 
Could you see them while away, you'd very likely say, 
They're the wildest looking men " Behind the Scenes." 
'Tis just the same in life, for what lots of care and strife, 
And suffering some folks will undergo, 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make themselves look fine, 
And think of nothing else but outside show, 
They fancy and suppose that those who wear good clothes 
Always look the richest and the best; 
But an honest heart and mind is respected most, you'll find, 
No matter whether poor or richly dressed, 
Still many one you know have caused themselves much woe, 
Through trying hard to live beyond their means, 
And though they wear a 
smile, yet really all the while 
They are very wretched just " Behind the Scenes."

NEW 
VERSION OF THE BELLE OF THE BALL. 
To a 
ball I 
one night was invited, 
And being so fond of the dance, 
At the prospect I 
felt quite delighted, 
And eagerly jumped at the chance; 
There were swells looking out for belles, 
And belles were fishing for beaux, 
But a 
pal introduced me to one 
Whom I 
thought far outrivalled the rose. 
CII011US. 
This is the belle of the ball, dear boy, 
This is the belle of the ball, dear boy, 
This is the best of them all, dear boy, 
She is the belle of the ball. 
The envy of all the fair dancers, 
She had such a 
fairy-like grace, 
But just in the midst of the lancers, 
The lady turned black in the face; 
She gurgled, she gasped, and she glared, 
And seized hold the tail of my coat; 
Alas, the top teeth of my partner 
Had slipped down her beautiful throat. 
SPOKEN.—Well, there's nothing so detrimental in a 
false 
tooth or two; so I 
thought still that— 
She was the belle, etc. 
How the ladies they giggled and tittered, 
Of course you may easily guess; 
Though my feelings were sadly embittered. 
I 
would not leave a 
girl in distress; 
So we madly rushed into a 
waltz, 
When she tumbled o'er some fellow's leg, 
When off came her hair—'twas all false, 
And her head it was bald as an egg. 
CHORUS. 
How is your belle of the ball, dear boy 
how is your belle of the ball dear boy 1 
0, wasn't she bald at the ball, dear boy 
How is your belle of the ball 1

And every time I'd chance to meet 
My old churn, Peter Green, 
He'd say, " Why, Brown, you've not one yet, 
And I've got seventeen." 
Spoken.—This became very annoying, so at last I 
said, " You 
needn't throw your seventeen children in my face quite so often, 
Peter ? 
I'm in no hurry for seventeen, and when I 
am I 
shall go 
to one of those convenient establishments who "supply familiPs

that—Clio. 
To behold the little stranger 
There's been quite an anxious crowd; 
They say, " Now I'm a 
father," 
I 
should really feel quite proud ;" 
And so I 
do, and oft with joy 
I 
feel as though I'd burst, 
When I 
hear them compliment me 
On the beauties of our first. 
Spoken.—I 
was in the garden catching earwigs when the news 
was brought me, and I 
couldn't help doing a 
peculiar kind of a 
can-can amongst the geraniums. A gentleman next door looked 
over, and said, " What is the matter, Mr. Brown ?" "Matter," 
said I—Cno. 
Egad I'm that excited, 
Every now and then I 
feels 
As though I 
scarce knew whether

Of course, we'll give a

Aye, a

COMING HOME FROM THE BALL. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. II. IlAnnnsiG, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. c. 
The Music of this song is published by E. IL H ARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
THERE iS 110 place so gay as the ball- room, 
When we are dancing in dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never greet us 
In the flash of the beautiful night ; 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasures we dearly adore, 
We must part from the scene so enchanting, 
And go home looking sleepy and sore. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, it's all very well to be waltzing, 
And the pleasures we love to recall, 
But you know how you feel in the morning, 
Coming home, coming home from the ball. 
There the ladies are rivals of Venus, 
And their smiles all around us do bestow, 
Every face wears a 
mantle of gladness, 
There is welcome wherever we go; 
But when morn comes around, we are weary, 
And we growl at the pain in our heads, 
And we think we are foolish for dancing 
When we should have been home in our bens. 
Oh, it's all, etc. 
All around us the music is floating, 
Light and gay as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
And we heed not the hours as they fly, 
Till the light peeping in through the window 
Makes us all bid each other good-bye. 
Oh. it's all, et,.. 
WALKING OUT ON SUNDAY 
W ALKING out on Sunday, I 
think awfully nice, 
What I 
would dispense with not at any price, 
So when the weather's " proper" I'm ready in a 
trice, 
To take my usual walk upon a 
Sunday. 
A 
drive out in a " trap," now, some folks seem to prize, 
But the exercise of walking I 
would first advise, 
Besides such funny sights, and oh! the horrid guys 
One meets with when they walk out on a 
Sunday. 
CHORUS. 
Walking out on Sunday ; in the afternoon, 
Trotting out on Sunday, in the afternoon, 
Crawling out on Sunday, in the afternoon, 
It's awfully jolly walking out on Sunday. 
Now there's the would-be lady as she sweeps along, 
With smallest of small bonnets, and largest of chignon, 
In the distance you might take her for one of the haut ton, 
As she goes " sailing" out upon a 
Sunday. 
And there's the counter-jumper, oh so very smart, 
Regardless of expense, all to captivate some heart, 
His garments are from Moses' most fashionable mart, 
And off he struts to meet his girl on Sunday. 
Walking out, etc. 
Then there's Augustus Tornkins, the very heavy smell, 
Who's got a 
little lodging somewhere in Camberwell, 
You'd take him for the Duke Alexis, or the Marquis of Pall-
mall, 
When he goes strolling out upon a 
Suuday. 
With his silver headed cane and glass stuck in one eye, 
He twirls his fine moustache which suspiciously looks of dye, 
In fact you seldom see so elegant a 
guy! 
As Tompkins when he's crawling out on Sunday. 
Walking out, etc. 
Some strongly recommend the walking in the Zoo 
Where one may see some very curious animals a 
few, 
But foreign looking puppies and lots of monkeys too, 
One meets with when they're walking out on Sunday. 
They swagger and they puff at their very mild cheroots, 
They drop their aitches every where, their grammar seldom 
its, 
They're grand about the head, oh ! hut queer about the boots 
As they do the lardy dar upon a 
Sunday. 
Walking out, etc.

OH, 
WHAT A DAY WE'RE HAVING. 
IF 
you'll listen I'll tell you what happened last week, 
Brown and I 
we went for our annual treat, 
And two pretty girls we happen'd to meet 
As we went to the Palace at the Park; 
The carriages all were as full as could be, 
So one pretty girl had to sit on my knee, 
And the other on Brown's, who shouted with glee, 
I 
say what a 
day we are having. 
C11011US. 
Ohl what a 
day we are having, 1 
say I 
Oh! what a 
day we are having, 
Enjoying ourselves with two pretty girls, 
I 
say what a 
day we are having. 
Our wives you must know we had both left at home 
So of course Brown and I 
were entirely alone, 
And we thought that about with these girls we could roam, 
And no one be any the wiser; 
We soon reached the Palace, the gardens went in, 
Play'd at kiss in the ring, drank brandy and gin, 
And some fellow smashed Brown's new hat right in, 
Singing, oh! what a 
day we are having. 
Oh : what a 
day, etc. 
(1) 
2 
OH, WHAT A DAY WE 'RE HAVING.—Con-
tinued. 
We all got as jolly as jolly could be, 
When Brown he proposed we should go and take tea, 
Oa this point the ladies of course did agree, 
So away to the tables we started ; 
We ordered the tea, I 
had scarce taken my place, 
When a 
basin of slops was thrown into my face, 
And two voices shouted out, here's a 
disgrace! 
And a 
very nice day you are having. 
Oh! what a 
day, etc. 
We both wiped our faces, look,d up with surprise, 
When there stood before us our two loving wives, 
ThreaVning to tear out those young ladies' eyes, 
And they'd already torn off their bonnets. 
Of course Brown and I 
no longer could stay, 
And with our two wives walked meekly away, 
And some swells in the crowd shouted out, Here I 
say ! 
What a 
day you young scamps have been having. 
SPOKEN.—Yes we had something to do, to square it with our 
wives, but Brown hit upon a 
happy thought, he proposed we 
should go to his house and finish the day, we did, he introduced 
the wine, we got jolly, Brown kissed my wife, J 
kissed his 
wife, then Brown said he would sing a 
comic song, this is what 
he sang— 
Oh! what a 
day we are having, I 
say, 
Oh! what a 
day we are having, 
Enjoying ourselves with our own proper girls, 
I 
say! what a 
day we are baying.

SHE WAS CLERK IN A CANDY STORE. 
Composed by FRED TER LINDEN. 
The Music of this Song is published by E. H. 
HARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
THE other day, up by the square, 
saw a 
pretty face, 
A 
pair of dancing sloe-black eyes, 
And actions full of grace; 
In silks and velvets by the yard, 
In the fashion of the day, 
Made up this charming little belle, 
Who stole my heart away. 
SPOREN.—I 
was struck very bad; I 
bowed; she bowed; We 
both bowed; and ' twas not long before I 
found out— 
. 
cumin. 
She was clerk in a 
candy store, 
She was clerk in a 
candy store, 
She was sweeter by far than the sweetest of sweets, 
Was this clerk of a 
candy store. 
And now we were the best of friends; 
We chatted, laughed, and talked ; 
Her theme was candy, mine was love, 
As down the street we walked; 
The best of friends must often part, 
left my heart's delight, 
But promised we should meet again 
'Neath the duskys hade of night. 
SPOKEN,—Yes, at nine o'clock that evening, I 
was to escort 
home— 
This clerk, etc. 
The twinkling stars shining bright, 
They seemed so full of life, 
Winked and nodded as I 
asked, 
If 
she would be my wife; 
And as she gently murmured " yes," 
One year from this sweet night, 
They danced and sparkled as if to say, 
We'll keep your pathway bright. 
She was clerk, etc. 
WHERE CAN MY LITTLE BROTHER BE ? 
Sung by HARRY OsnonNE. 
Where can my little brother be ? 
Why ever did he stray 
his loss has been a 
blow to me, 
I'll hope he'll stay away; 
To bring him back, my love is such, 
I 
must some plan devise, 
My grief is when I 
think how much 
'Twill cost to advertise. 
CHORUS. 
Where can my little brother be ? 
Can he have gone away, 
To study hard at Botany, 
Afar in Botany Bay ? 
He's six feet high and very lean, 
His length's his chiefest charm, 
His boots are twelves, his gloves sixteens, 
lie's tatoo'd on his arm ; 
His face a 
noble cast was deemed, 
A 
cast his optics bore, 
His Roman nose turn'd up, and seemed 
To say Excelsior. 
CHORUS. 
Where can my little brother be 1 
Why ever did he stray l 
His loss has been a 
blow to me, 
I'll hope he'll stay away. 
'Twas doubtful when I 
saw him, for 
us form was faint and dim; 
You could not quite be sure which was 
His shadow, which was him; 
His legs were like the pelican's, 
So tall he seem'd indeed, 
With graceful neck, long as the swan's, 
A 
hop pole run to seed. 
Where can, 
etc. 
His voice it is a 
baritone, 
And if you heard him try 
To sing, I 
feel assured it would bring 
A 
tear into your eye; 
His upper notes are like the lark's, 
his lower notes are groans ; 
Perha1n the Negro Minstrels have 
Bought him up for bones. 
Where can, etc.

CHEESE IT. 
Ain.—" Knickerbocker Line." 
THE other afternoon, as I 
walked the streets along, 
I 
thought I 
saw a 
new and noble subject for a 
song— 
Two newsboys had a 
little row, a 
policeman near them sees it, 
He steps between, and says, young coves, I 
guess you'd better 
cheese it. 
I 
soon got tired walking and dropped my fine cigar, 
Took a 
seat beside a 
nice young gal in a 
city railroad car; 
Her little hand lay close to mine, I 
gently tried to squeeze it, 
She says, you're mistaken in the gal, I 
guess you'd better 
cheese it. 
The other night I 
told my wife, that I 
was going to the lodge, 
And took a 
walk with another girl, just for a 
little dodge; 
My wife followed close bel.ind, and my po,r hair how she did 
seize it. 
SPOKEN.—And she says, " Young miss, if you want that Pe-
ruvian waterfall of yours saved, you'd better skip: and as for 
you— 
When I 
get you home, I'll show you how to cheese it. 
I 
went home with her without a 
word, undressed, and went to 
bed. 
My wife she took the poker up, and beat a 
tattoo on my head ; 
It felt so sore I 
had to get a 
pint of oil to greese it, 
And she thinks if it gets well again, I'll have sense enough to 
eheese it.

THE MAN WITH A CREAM-COLORED HORSE 
BANJO SOLO. 
Flying Trapeze." 
IF 
you'll listen to me a 
sad tale I 
tell, 
How blight and misfortune my poor heart befell, 
I 
loved a 
young damsel and loved her full well, 
And to marry we both were inclined; 
For the girl I 
adored she was handsome, 
And sadly I 
grieve for my loss, 
But all my fond hopes have been blighted 
By a 
man on a 
cream- colored horse. 
CHORUS. 
He rode around the ring with the greatest of ease, 
He stood on his head while his toes he would seize, 
He shot through the hoops like a 
bullet through cheese, 
Did this man on a 
cream- colored horse. 
I 
took Liza Jane to the circus one night, 
When she put me in a 
most terrible plight. 
She applauded so loud they all thought she was tight, 
And of course most jealous I 
grew. 
Says I, Liza Jane, do be quiet ; said she, sir, you're not my boss, 
And she called for three cents worth of peanuts 
For the man on a 
cream-colored horse. 
He rode around, etc. 
And when we went home we'd a 
terrible row, 
I 
called her false-hearted, she'd broken her vow, 
When she said, sir, be off, I've done with you now, 
Fin engaged to the star of the ring. 
Pm to be the Senora Spoonnetta, 
And I'll travel with him of course, 
throw a 
flip-flap from his eye-brow, 
And I'll light on his cream- colored horse. 
He rode around, etc.

You're glad to leave the crowded room, 
And, if the night be fair, 
To lean upon a 
balcony 
To get a 
breath of air; 
And, if you've some one by your side, 
She won't take it amiss 
If in a 
quiet sort of way 
You steal a 
little kiss.-Cno. 
When curtains screen you from the room, 
And nobody can see, 
To pop the question quietly 
What better place can be I 
The coldest-hearted must relent, 
You very soon will find, 
For girls upon a 
balcony 
Have never proved unkind.-Co. 
Who first invented balconies 
It isn't clearly shown, 
But I 
am much inclined to think 
The thought was Cupid's own; 
At any rate he makes them now 
His own especial care, 
For on a 
quiet moonlit night 
You'll always find him there.-Cno. 
Then, if you like in summer time 
To watch the stars so blight, 
What place is half so pleasant as 
A 
balcony at night i 
But bachelors, both young and old, 
It's clear from what I've shown, 
If you'd keep single you must leave 
Those balconies alone. 
Spoken.-And never catch yourself-Cuo.

PUSSEY BROTHERS. 
Aut.—"Champagne Charlie." 
On, here we are, two big fat boys, 
As you can plainly see; 
We are always in for lots of fun, 
And sometimes for a 
spree. 
But we are here to amuse you all, 
And drive away dull care, 
No doubt you think us pleasant, 
For we're such a 
big fat pair. 
CHORUS. 
For big fat Charley that's ou!. name, 
Big fat Charley that's our name. 
Chief engineer in a 
coffee saloon, 
And we peddle ice cream in the month of June. 
For big fat Charley that's our name, 
Big fat Charley that's our name, 
Good for any game at night, me boys, 
Now who'll join us in this quiet dance. 
Now Charley here he always boasts 
About him being so stout, 
But when E 
say just look at me, 
He tells me to get out; 
I 
laugh at him and he gets mad, 
And says he'll tell my mother; 
Don't you think it very funny, 
He should tell on his big fat brother. 
For big fat, etc. 
One day I 
ran with my sad tale, 
Expecting to have fun, 
But the laugh instead of being on me, 
Was on Chaney number one; 
For to Iny mother he did go, 
And told his story without scope, 
She at him flew and ran him through 
With a 
bar of her s)ft soap. 
For big fat. etc,

LOVELY NIGHT. 
LOVELY night ! lovely night ! 
They have called thee dark and drear, 
But the light, but the light 
Is to me not half so dear. 
For, though the sunlight gladsome seems, 
Too oft it brings but tears alone— 
But circled with thy fairy dreams, 
How many joys my heart bath known! 
CHORUS. 
Lovely night! lovely night ! 
Zhey have called thee dark and drear, 
But the light, but the light 
Is to me not half so dear. 
Lovely night ! lovely night! 
Though thy dews may be thy tears, 
Yet how bright, yet how bright 
From thy grief the world appears! 
The flowers that before, at noon, 
Had faded with the sun's warm ray, 
When smiled on by the gentle moon, 
Revive to bless the coming day. 
Lovely night, etc.

Sleep, baby, sleep, till dawn to-morrow, 
Why should'st thou weep, who know'st no sorrow I 
Too soon come pains and fears, 
Too soon a

So from thy future years 
No sadness borrow. 
Dream, baby, dream, thine eyelids quiver, 
Know'st thou the theme of yonder river 7 
It saith, " Be calm, be sure,

So shall thy life endure,

For if my old woman should but pop in, 
There's bound to be a 
row.

THE BLIGHTED HUSBAND, OR POOR MAR-
RIED MAN. 
KIND friends, I'm a 
martyr, a 
thing of the past, 
A 
poor faded flower that cannot long last, 
Tho' once I 
was jolly, handsome and free, 
But my wife has quite settled me. 
I 
thought when I 
got married to Miss Angelina Green, 
That I 
should be the happiest man the world, had ever seen, 
But how to tell, this awful tale my blighted features scan, 
Then let me be a 
warning to each unmarried man. 
SPOREN.—Yes, my happy single friends, look at me—a 
mar-
ried man. 
You see I'm married, although a 
few months back I 
was considered a 
sweet and interesting youth ; but now they 
call me the " Caution." 
CHORUS. 
I 
once was so handsome, rosy and gay, 
But now I 
am settled and faded away, 
In fact I 
was rakish and called " Giddy Dan," 
Behold me a 
poor married man. 
No youth could be fairer than I 
used to be, 
The pride and hope of the whole family, 
The image of my mother, the pet of my dad, 
A 
sweet- tempered, round shouldered lad ; 
My youthful hopes all vanished when my heart was stole away, 
I 
thought Miss Green had money, but grieves me now to say 
She was ugly, lame, and squinted, and tall as a 
giraffe, 
My friends instead of pitying me they only jeer and laugh. 
SHOKEN. —
Yet she never treated me to a 
jam tart, or a 
penny 
valentine ; all she thinks about is reading all the high ilass 
novels, " Jack Sheppard," " The Road to Ruin," " The New-
gate Calendar," " Sketches " by Turpin awl Caleraft, and other 
eminent authors; whilst I—poor Bounce! she calls me " Boggy' 
—has to do the washing and run errands for the lodgers ; but 
mind you, a 
day will come, ' twill be a 
will- come day. 
I 
once was so, etc. 
DOWN BY THE VILLAGE WELL. 
'Twas summer time not long ago 
When down in Leicestershire, 
'Twas there I 
saw a 
maiden fair, 
With eyes so blue and clear; 
She was a 
farmer's daughter ' 
And her name was Nellie Bell, 
She stole my heart and I 
won hers 
While courting by the well. 
CHORUS. 
Down by the village well, 
Down by the village well, 
'Twas there I 
courted Nellie Bell 
Down by the village well. 
First time I 
saw my Nellie Bell 
Quite deep in love 1 
fell, 
I 
asked her whither she was bound, 
When these words answered Nell: 
I'm going to fetch some water, sir, 
For mother dear in the dell, 
Awl she ,gayly chattered by my side 
Whilst walking to the well. 
Down by the village, etc. 
Day by day and night by night 
I 
met my Nellie dear, 
And Ielpd her fetch the water from 
The spring so pure and clear ; 
I 
asked her if she'd marry me 
And come with me to dwell, 
And Nellie she consented as 
We stood beside the well. 
Down by the village, etc. 
I'm very happy now to- day, 
I 
lead a 
jolly life; 
I 
smoke my pipe, enjoy my glass, 
And slkire it with my wife. 
And as the years roll gayly on 
I 
hope I'll live to tell, 
And even bless the nicht I 
met 
My Nellie by the well.

PUT BY FOR A RAINY DAY. 
()fames the world may laugh, and jeer at what I'm going to 
say, 
That is, provide yourselves, my friends, in case of a 
rainy 
day ; 
For if you don't, when you grow old, on what I 
say depend, 
If you can't help yourself, ' tis hard to find a 
friend. 
cuoans. 
So now be careful, and be wise, and, like me, stow away, 
A 
little pelf, to protect yourself, in case of a 
rainy day; 
Be not extravagant or mean, have just what you require, 
Be kind and provident to all, it is my heart's desire; 
When I 
see my fellow creature is trodden down with strife, 
To help him on the road is a 
proud time of my life. 
So now be careful, &c. 
" 
Waste not, want not," my motto is, a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
And this another I'd prescribe: " Touch nothing out of reach ;" 
For " honesty's best policy," so honest people say, 
And just remember, though but small, put up for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, & c. 
A 
pin a 
day, is a 
groat a 
year, which proves that the smallest 
mite 
Put by will soon accumulate, and shows my words are right; 
So persevere when in your youth, and then when old you'll say, 
I 
care not now how the world treats me, I 
thought of a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, &c. 
I'm hale, I'm jolly, as you can see, and I 
like my friends to call, 
Though the best of friends I've ever found, was my pocket, 
after all ; 
For that old friend sticks to me still, through thick and thin, 
I 
say, 
If you would be advised by me, put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, & c. 
" 
A 
friend in need's a 
friend indeed," but how often whe4 
you're poor, 
Those friends will pass you one by one, and on you close t.he 
door ; 
So let your motto be like mine, whatc'er the world may say. 
Look out for number one, that is— put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, ko.

BUT OF COURSE ITS NO ROSINESS OF NINE. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Some people say I 
am curious, 
For they know that I 
never refuse, 
No matter from whence I 
obtain it, 
In getting the latest of news. 
I 
certainly own that I 
do so, 
And no harm there is I 
opine; 
But whatever I 
hear I 
keep close, 
For of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, I 
see lots of chaps on Broadway. 
Who ai 
dressed in very best style, 
With a 
diamond pin stuck in their bosoms, 
With kids and the shiniest tile. 
They measure out tape in some shop, 
And their salaries ain't very fine; 
Now I'd like to know how it is done, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, there's Jones, he's a 
temperance man, 
And he never will go near a 
bar, 
But his nose is as red as a 
berry, 
It shines like a 
lighthouse afar. 
He always drinks milk on a 
Sunday, 
And he says that it's wholesome and fine; 
He's a 
friend of the late Deacon Smythe, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now. I 
know lots of married men, too, 
That are steady and sober at home; 
When they're out of the sight of their spouses, 
From paths which are narrow they roam. 
They drive about town in their coaches, 
And you oft see them kick up a 
shine; 
To the " Personals" daily they're writing, 
But of sourae it's no busincee of mine. 
SUNSHINE AFTER RAIN 
I 
left my love in Ireland, 
In poverty and pain; 
The tears hung heavy in my eyes, 
But hers came down like rain; 
I 
gave her half of all I 
had, 
Repressed the rising sigh; 
For, thinking of the days to come, 
I 
kept my courage high. 
"Farewell," I 
said, " if seasons pass, 
And sunshine follows rain, 
And morning dawns on darkest night, 
You'll see me back again." 
I 
left my love in Ireland, 
And sailed the stormy sea, 
To earn my bread by daily toil, 
An honest man and free. 
I 
wrought and strove from morn to night, 
And saved my little store; 
And every summer gave me wealth, 
And made the little more. 
At length I 
bought the field I 
plough'd, 
The sunshine followed rain. 
The morning dawned on heavy night, 
And I 
went back agian. 
I 
sought my love in Ireland, 
And brought her o'er the sea, 
And happy man, a 
happy wife, 
To bless my home and me. 
My farm is large, my wants are small, 
I 
bid my care depart, 
And sit beneath my own oak tree 
With proud and grateful heart. 
The children smiling round the board, 
Ne'er ask for bread in -vain; 
'Tis balmy morning after night, 
'Pis sunshine after rain.

NOT SO EASY TO DO. 
As Sung by JOHNNY SMITH, Comic Vocalist. 
It's all very well for people to tell, the course they mean to pursue; 
There are many things easy to talk about, but they're not so easy 
to do. 
I've beard mary a 
speech that a 
mile would teach, 
But strange to relate up to this very date, such people do nothing 
but talk. 
Words are but wind very often we find. and I 
think you'll agree it 
is true, 
There are many things easy to talk about, but they're not so easy 
to do. 
The tetotalers. they hi.ve been trying, they say, to rob us of hearty 
good cheer, 
And because they, yen see, prefer water and tea, they would stop 
us from drinking our beer. 
Despite their abuse, they'll find it no use, if they try to close up 
our pubs, 
We've as Innen right I 
think, to a 
smoke and a 
drink, as those who 
can stand the big clu , 
s. 
They may chatter for hours with E 
peecir - mak in g 
powers, and hold 
temperance hall meetings too, 
Ent they'd find it is easy to talk about, but it is not so easy to do. 
I 
courted a 
girl, a 
charming young love, a 
beautiful creature di-
vine. 
But a 
rival I 
found, who was fast gaining ground, so I 
asked this 
fair girl to be mitre ; 
Being first in the field, 1 
had no wish to yield. but she with my 
rival took flight. 
I 
called him a 
scamp, with my girl to decamp. So he sent me a 
elta•-
lenge to fight; 
My friends said " go in, you are certain to win,' but he was about 
six feet two, 
And fighting is easy to talk about, but it's not so easy to do. 
I've now got a 
wife, and we never have strife, for we've tempers 
uncommonly solid ; 
The 0110 point on which we at all disagree, is because we're not 
blessed with a 
Child. 
I 
should really like one, say a 
nice little son brit my wile says a 
girl is Use best; 
And NV Len I 
walk out, my friends are about, and they make this 
a 
subject for jest. 
While some I 
have read, have too many instead, for' th. .y-re blessed 
with a 
dozen or two, 
Well, keeping them's easy to talk about, but it's not so easy to do. 
There are natures so proud, that they talk very loud. as they to 
great pov.er advance ; 
They mutter and say, we are going to decay. and at our possessions 
they glance. 
When foes they combine. ' tis time I 
opine, that we should look 
after our selves, 
And rezdy will be, our sons of the sea, to secure any covetous elves, 
For ages ' tis known, we have herb held our own, al:hough we've 
been threatened a 
few, 
But they know it's so easy to talk about, but it's not Lo easy to do

MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. 
I 
said on the morning I 
married, 
'Tis the happiest day of my life, 
As down sunny Broadway I 
hurried, 
With my beautiful dutiful wife. 
Each day will but add to my pleasure, 
Along with the one I 
adore, 
But I 
soon discovered the plague of my life, 
It was not toy friends, my servants or wife, 
But my fussy old mother-in-law, the bore, 
My fussy old motherin-law. 
The honeymoon over, returning 
To town with my dear little bride, 
The care of the world I 
was spurning, 
As we sat by our own fireside. 
Said she, to my side drawing nearer, 
As servants they are such a 
bore, 
And mother's a 
widow and lonely, dear, 
We cannot do better than send for her here, 
I 
answered her, yes, to be sure—oh, Lor, 
And I 
sent for my mother-in-law. 
One morning, in desperate hurry, 
A cab it drove up to my door, 
Containing six boxes, a 
bundle, 
Two trunks and my mother-in-law. 
Down the steps, in a 
terrible flurry, 
To meet my wife's parent I 
tore, 
Saying. Welcome, dear madam, pray step this way, 
I'm really delighted to meet you to- day, 
As I 
handed in mother-in-law, the bore, 
My respectable mother-in-law. 
My life up to this was delicious, 
I 
never hid cause for a 
froN‘n, 
But Mamma was so very officious, 
My house it was turned up-side down, 
The way she upset all my customs,

MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. feum.LuDED.1 
I 
very soon voted a 
bore, 
She worried and skurried me out of my life, 
1 
began to imagine, instead of toy wife, 
I 
had married my mother in-how, 
Officious old mother-in-law. 
In my house I 
was not my own master, 
Each day we'd a 
family jar, 
My wife couldn't expend a 
dollar, 
Without asking Darling Mamma. 
Mamma can do this, and Mamma can do that. 
At length very plainly I 
saw, 
If I 
wished to be happy and pass my life, 
Quite free from matrimonial strife, 
I 
must part with my mother-in-law, the bore, 
Interfering old mother-in-law. 
She told me so rudely one morning, 
I 
hadn't the least common sense, 
So it seems, my dear mother, I 
answered, 
With your presence I 
now can dispense. 
So pack up your luggage, and off you go, 
I've had quite enough of your jaw, 
I'm determined no longer you stay with me. 
She departed that morning and left me free, 
Of my fussy old mother-In-law, the bore, 
Disagreeable old mother-in-law. 
A moral my song is adorning, 
To persons about to be wed, 
Will serve as au excellent warning, 
Remembering all I 
have sad, 
Relations are always best apart, 
Is a 
saving you've lielrd once before, 
In two there is company, three there is none, 
Be certain your every comfort is gone, 
if you live with a 
mother-in-law, be sure.

THE BUGABOO. 
As Sung by J 
E 
REY BARRINGTON. 
COME all ye tender-hearted boys, wherever you may be, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardships, my boys, that I 
went 
throuffh,* 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys, on board of the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
The day when first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal : 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never 
shall : 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrab boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
*Primal. 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plough the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of Richmond barracks so 
true,* 
When the gallant 84th fired a 
royal salute of bricks at the cap-
tain of the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We sailed three years when a storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark blue 
sky, 
So the second mate (Tave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—he set 
fire to the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When the captain found what he had done, he loud for help did 
shout, 
He called up through the chimney- top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out ; 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so hard through the middle of the turf, 
they couldn't save the Bugaboo. 
*Ripeat. 
When fifteen thousand miles from land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so bard one night, that it couldn't burn any-
more; 
So the captain he gave orders to lower the boats and save the 
crew,* 
While 1,000 rods of turf an•I 
0')!") men were smothered in the 
Bugaboo.

LIMERICK IS BEAUTIFUL. 
As sung by JOHNNY NOLAN. 
0 ! Limerick is beautiful, as every body knows, 
The river Shannon, full of fish, besides that city flows, 
Tis not the river, nor the fish, that weighs upon my mind, 
Or with the town of Limeriek have I 
any fault:to find. 
Oh the girl I 
love is beautiful, as fain-eyed as the fawn ; 
She lives in Garryowen and is called the Colleen BDAV 
And proudly as that river flows, besides that blessed city, 
More prouder still, without a 
doubt, the Colleen goes by 
me. 
CHORUS. 
Och hone, Och hone, 
Oh. then Limerick is beautiful as every body knows, 
Oh, Norah, you're my darling, Acushla Grammachree. 
Oh, if I 
was the Emperor of Russia to command 
Or Julius Caesar, or the Lord lieutenant of the land. 
I'd give my gold, my silver plate, likewise my army, 
The Horse-guards, the Rifles and the Royal Artillery, 
I'd give the crown from off my head, my people en their 
knees, 
d 
give my fleet of sailing ships upon the briny seas, 
A beggar would go to bed, to rise at early dawn 
It 
by my side just as a 
bride, I'd find my Colleen Bawn. 
CHO RUS. 
Och hone, Och hone, 
Oh, then Limerick is beautiful as every body knows, 
Oh, Norah, you're my darling. Acnshla Grammachree.

NEVER GO BACK ON THE POOR. 
Am.—" Don't put your foot on a 
man when he's down." 
IN 
this world of sorrow, of toil and regret, 
There are scenes I 
would gladly pass o'er, 
But stern truth compels that each fact must be told, 
That thro' life we may check them the more. 
Is it right that a 
man who has well earned his pay 
On the pipes by the sweat of his brow, 
Should wait like a 
beggar content day by day, 
Or else home in hunger to go 1 
CHORUS. 
If a 
man is in trouble, remember this song, 
Go drive the grim wolf from his door, 
Assist him in need, you will seldom be wrong, 
If you never go back on the poor. 
From the wil I 
waste of waters a 
death-cry came, 
As dashed on the iron-bound shore, 
A 
noble ship struck in the darkness of night, 
And sank ' mid the tempest's loud roar, 
The captain asleep and the men off their posts, 
With the coal and provisions run short, 
While the doomed ones they hoped for that bright western 
land, 
Which in joyous sweet dreams they had sought. 
CHORUS. 
Can it be such neglect shall by us be forgot ? 
Or that money shall triumpti once more? 
A 
good willing hand, a 
stout branch and a 
rope, 
For those who go back on the poor.

NEVER GO BACK ON THE POOR.—Continued. 
When the divers went down ' neath the wreck to search 
For the victims that lay far below, 
"'Tis only a 
steerage," was oft the remark, 
As the ghastly form came up to view. 
As if only a 
steerage could shut out a 
soul, 
Because poverty 'claimed him her own; 
As if dollars and dimes are the standard of worth, 
And the pass to all good that is known. 
CHORUS. 
But the White Star must change its emblem aloft, 
To blood- red, afloat and ashore, 
Till the steamer Atlantic's forgotten by time, 
With its cargo of unburied poor. 
At the stands on the corner of every street, 
The aged and the blind used to be, 
And work out a 
living to save them from want, 
From the poor-house that they might be free. 
But now, stout Italians, healthy and strong, 
Each old grandmother's driven away ; 
I 
don't think the people will stand the base wrong, 
Of these people who work under pay. 
CHORUS. 
And the newsboy or bootblack that toils morn and night 
To keep hunger and pain from the door 
have been pushed to the wall by these great organ men, 
Let us never go back on the poor.

THE REFORMER ON THE SLY. 
Revised and Sung by JOHNNY noecti with great SUCCOM 
Good people all, take my advice, and listen unto me, 
But don't put too much confidence in every man you see, 
They say, fine feathers make fine birds, but not so every one, 
For men will often wear broadcloth, to hide their little game, 
But whether they are fish or fowl it makes no difference to I, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
reformer on the sly. 
There are fifty kinds of swindling-mills in the papers every day, 
And lotteries where you draw a 
farm (God knows how far away.) 
There's politicians now- a-days that at public expense, 
They rob our city government and leave it not worth a 
cent, 
I 
wish for once I 
was a 
Judge, and had those thieves to try, 
They'd get sent up and polished off, by a 
reformer on the sly. 
There's Madam Morris, from Corsica, who with her telescope, 
Your future wife or husband shows. 
Good graci.us that's a 
joke, 
If you give to her but fifty cents, she'll send you a 
card by mail, 
I 
think they ought to find her a 
home, six months in the county 
There's the seventh daughter of the seventh son to swindle you. 
they'll try, 
But I 
know their little euchre game, Fin a 
reformer on the slr. 
n 
Chatham street, the other day I 
took a 
walk along, 
I 
heard a 
fellow crying out, going, going, gone. 
Who bids for it, this fine gold watch, the finest ever seen, 
'I he thought I 
was a 
little flat—perhaps a 
little green— 
I 
says, excuse me, please, if I 
wink so with my eye, 
I 
know toy business, you can bet, rnt a 
reformer on tits sly.

BEAUTIFUL LOVE. 
As sung by (
us WILLIAMS. 
Lovm, love, oh, what is love 
love, ' tis that makes man feel so 
peculiar : 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud, a Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia 7 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round and 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the first attack it's like raspberry jam, running 
down ones back. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, love it is that makes a 
man feel so pecu 
liar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man's but a 
fool when he falls in love. 
Oh, love, when you're in love, to presents, to parties and picnics 
you treat her, 
Oh, love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel just as the' you'd 
like to eat her ; 
But the best of loves must part—then an end comes to your 
bliss, 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the 
'tortilla kiss 
You bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
Oh, love, etc. 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning yourself 
in cold water; 
If it's all riuht she'll gig;.,
,le and say, please ask father if I 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, etc. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked- for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beautiful twins. 
Oh love, etc.

IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU FEEL THAT WAY. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
SHAN'T forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
CHORUS, 
I 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took bar down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the ices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
We met again one afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own ; 
She blushed and said, go see papa and ask *him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
The old man said that we might wed and so he crowned our 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass away, 
I 
long to hear those wedding bells, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt :IQ tho', etc.

They're certain to fall fast asleep.

LITTLE SWEETHEART, COME AND KISS NE. 
Words by AUTIIIIR W . 
FRENCH. 
Music by W. II. BROCKWAY• 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAms, 
The Music of this Song is published by Winn,: & GOULLAUD, 136 Tre• 
mont Street, Boston. 
Price 35 cents. 
Little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Just once more before I 
go , 
Tell me truly, will you miss me, 
As I 
wonder to and fro ? 
Let me feel the tender pressing 
Of your ruby lips to mine, 
With your dimp e 
hands caressing, 
And your snowy arms entwine. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Come and whisper sweet and low ! 
That your heart will sadly miss me, 
As I 
wander to . and fro. 
Little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
We may never meet again ! 
We may never roam together 
Down the dear old shady lane 
Future years may bring us sorrow, 
That our hearts but little know, 
Still of care we should not borrow; 
Conic and kiss me ere I 
go. 
Ali, little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Come and whisper sweet and low ! 
That your heart will sadly miss me, 
As I 
wander to and fro.

LET NE PRAY BEFORE I 
DIE. 
(A poor motherless boy was found stowed away on board of an 
English steamer. He told the mate whose dutv it was to look after 
chi cases, that " he had been put aboard by a 
relative." 
The mate, 
not believing the story, and suspecting some of the crew hi the matter 
told the boy that be had two minutes to live, and advised him to speak 
the truth, and save his life. " Oh," said the little boy, " I've told all 
the truth, but let me pray before 1 
die."] 
Sad and weary, far from home, 
None to help or save him there; 
Pale as angry ocean's foam, 
Knelt the ragged boy in praye 
Gently bowed his noble head; 
Mother watched him from the 
These the only words he said; 
" 
Let me pray before I 
die.), 
Pale and tearful all around, 
Hushed the noise of brefsze and ware, 
Cords are brought, his hands are bound 
All are silent as the grave. 
Mild blue eyes are raised in prayer, 
Death and parting bring no sigh ; 
Please one moment do but spare. 
" 
Let Inc pray before I 
die." 
Softened thus the sailor stood ; 
Lo I 
he heeds that pleading form, 
Brave his heart, so kind and good, 
Brightly fell the tear drops warm. 
Swiftly he flew, as ocean birds, 
There around the joyful cry, 
Kissed the lips that breathed the word 
"Let me pray before I 
die."
