Emma <Nacel?>: We left Potter the last part of November.
M. Fuller: That was Potter, Nebraska.... Potter, Nebraska, yes, for Colorado. There were
Dad and <Nana?> and the four of us youngsters. The oldest one was eight, and the other
one, five, I was two and the baby was six weeks old, when we started. Now, what all they
had in the wagon I don't know because it was full, of course, and there were just the two
little mules to pull it, leaving the horse to use for a lead horse in case the road was bad.
The,.. I don't know much about the trip as far as Greeley but at Greeley they let me go
with Dad to the blacksmith shop to have the mules shod and that was about the prettiest
place I thought I'd ever seen. The fire, the force and the sparks that flew all over. It was
really something. Then how,..what passes we went over I don't know, but we came to
Kremmling, and went down Gore Canyon and that I guess was really some canyon to go
through, not very good road and narrow. Then Toponas and McCoy and State <Irisse?
>, Wolcott, Eacle and at Gypsum we started over <Cottonwood?> Pass or the way to
Glenwood and it wasn't too <unintelligiable text>. Then on through Rifle, Parachute...
Grand Valley now... Debeque. We were in Debeque on <unintelligiable text>. There they
had a camp house that the

(E.N.) different campers could use and Dad went up into town and got four Ben Davis
apples, no, five, that was our Christmas. Then the next stop was Atwell Bridge and then
down Plateau Canyon. The road was on the opposite side of the creek from what it is now
and it wasn't too good a road because they had to use the lead horse all the way. But he
wouldn't pull unless he was led so either <gap> or <gap> the older brother, took turnabout
leading him down the canyon. Then we ferried over the Grand River now the Colorado, at
Palisade. And where we camped on those nights I have no idea but we did come down,
right down Main Street in Grand Junction and on out to the claim, north of Fruita. Four
miles north of Fruita and a mile and a half north of Highpoint. Dad had expected some kind
of a cabin there but there wasn't anything but creasewood, rabbit brush and sage. High
as your head. And a few logs lying criss-cross in a clearing. But <gap> kindly offered a
cabin on his place at the foot of Highpoint Hill for us to use until something could be built
on the claim to house the family. Dad gladly consented to do that and it was much better
than camping out in wintertime even though one of the doors was missing, but by using
a strip of carpet tacked over it it did very well to keep the snow and the wind out, though I
remember seeing snow clear across the floor at times. How long it took to <unintelligible
text> to build to live in on the claim I just don't know. But with the Panic of 1893 money
was scarce and hard to get materials and we just had to use just whatever was at hand.
So he, he started building a dugout, digging down three or four feet and pulling up with
cottonwood poles and roofing it and <unitelligible text> in it. And in that way we soon had
something we could <unintelligible text> into. When we moved in and it was warmed up

(E.N.) cottonwood poles started leafing out. (laugh) As soon as the school opened at
Highpoint after the Christmas vacation, <gap> and <gap> the older sister and brother,
went to school there. He had a window in the door of the dugout and a window on one
side and at one time when my younger brother, Herbert, and I were left alone there we
saw either a dog or a coyote look in through the window. Probably a coyote because there
were no dogs around but we stayed <quiet?> and everything was all right.
M.F. But scared...(laughter)
E.N. I guess we were scared. After the family moved out on the claim the next thing was
to clear the land so that there would be something to plant in the spring. Dad had eighty
acres there, but only ten acres were under the Grand Valley so that was all that could
be watered. The rest of the land was what would be under government highline and that
didn't come through with water for that part of the country until 1917. So with grub hoe and
scraper and plow he started clearing that land and leveling it about ten acres. There were
washes in it and high spots but there was a lot of work to get that done and then when it
came time for the water to be in the Grand Valley, and the Grand Valley was only about
two hundred feet from the house, and the <unintelligible text> wash was on the other side
of us. The Flume #14 on the Grand Valley was right close to us all the time.
M.F. What crop did he plant <gap>? Food was his first concern, wasn't it?

E.N. The one <thing?>, they hadn't had fruit in Nebraska but there was a <unintelligible
text> at the time so he planted an orchard, apples, pears, apricots, peaches, cherries,
every kind of fruit you could think of-and planted a strawberry patch, one of the
3.
<204?>
(E.N.) first things, and then in the rows of the trees he planted asparagus. And food crops,
dry beans and carrots and vegetables... carrots and beets, and potatoes that could be
put in a cellar to be used for next winter's food. Cabbages and tomatoes, and there was a
sorghum patch, and corn. The sorghum he had pressed at a press not too far from Fruita
and cooked down into sorghum and that was part of our spread for bread. He planted
pumpkins and squash, too, and Mama made a lot of pumpkin butter and that was always
good as a spread altho she had put down butter in stone crocks with salt and then a layer
of butter and then salt and anotner layer of butter in Nebraska, that we brought with us and
in that way we had butter for a while, probably a year.
M.F. You had no cow or any meat?
E.N. No cow, yet, no, and the meat we had was cottontails. (laughter) But oh, it was good!
The cottontails were plentiful and Dad had his old #10 shotgun with him wherever he
went, that he brought in plenty of rabbits. And <gap> just cooked them and then fried
them in cracker crumbs and egg and they were good. Some who ate them with us there
thought they were chicken. Then the rabbits were so plentiful that the young orchard had
to be racked so they wouldn't eat the bark off the trees through the winter. And the rabbit
brush was used for that, tied around all the <little?> fruit trees to keep the rabbits from

eating them and it works. The first spring we were trying to get a headgate in the Grand
Valley Ditch so there'd be fall enough to water all of this, about ten acres <unintelligible
text> because they were just a little bit high but by going clear to the very east edge of the
place he managed to do it but that was a long ditch there he thought but he got the water
through. And when alfalfa was ready for the first cutting
