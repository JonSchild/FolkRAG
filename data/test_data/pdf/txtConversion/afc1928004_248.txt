Those laughing eyes, those laughing eyes, 
How beautiful and bright; 
Like glitt'ring gems, like ghtt'ring gems, 
They sparkle in the light. 
As sunlight on the dancing waves, 
'I hose radiant orbs of thine, 
As coral from the rocky cave, 
Yes, brilliantly they shine, 
As sunlight on the dancing waves, 
Those radiant orbs of thine,— 
As coral from the rocky cave, 
Yes, brilliantly they shine. 
Those laughing eyes, those laughing eyes, 
They wreathe a 
magic spell, 
Round the enchanted gazer's heart: 
In vain he breathes farewell. 
He seems to doubt, now gazes still— 
Now Lope, now fear, denies; 
One look of love the senses thrill, 
From those clear laughing eyes. 
He seems to doubt, now gazes still. 
Now hope, now fear, denies ; 
One look of love the senses thrill, 
From those dear laughing eyes,

And pledges of love renew;

As sung by Antall BErtma-rr. 
Words by Pnexic DUMONT. 
liusio by .7...anes B. STftwa.tra. 
The roses and lilies now bloom in the dell, 
They smile in their beauty for Kathleen Machree ; 
She trips to the glen that we both know so well, 
While I 
am so anxious her sweet face to see. 
0, could you but list to the sound of her voice, 
It fills me with joy, 'tis music to me ; 
When I 
ask if she loves me, her answer will be— 
A 
kiss from the lips of sweet Kathleen Machree. 
CHORUS. 
Kathleen Machree, sweet Kathleen Machree, 
No rose in the dell can compare love with thee ; 
Kathleen Machree sweet Kathleen Machree, 
My own little darling, sweet Kathleen Machree. 
Kathleen Machree, Kathleen Machree, Kathleen Machree. 
Some maidens are sweeter and fairer to view, 
But none cal; compare with sweet Kathleen Machreo, 
She wins with her smiles and her heart free from guile, 
While close by her side I 
am longing to be. 
0, she will be waiting to-night in the glen, 
With words that are fond and sweetest to me; 
She's the dearest to me and the fairest of all, 
My own little darling, sweet Kathleen Machree.

AS 
sung by ALICE BENNETT. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead, 
Whom we loved so dear— 
Like a 
dream his spirit fled 
From our home, now sad and drear; 
When the spring- time flowers were blooming, 
And the happy birds sung sweet, 
Angels called him to their home, 
Up in Heaven where we shall meet. 
CHORUS. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead 
Hope with him has fled 
From our home, now sad and ion) 
Close the shutters— Willie's dead. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead ; 
Gone in childhood's bloom— 
rillow'd now his lit le head 
In the cold and silent tomb. 
e'er Ys grave the daisies bhm;som, 
Where his little form is hid ; 
And the murm'ring streamlct ptays 
'Neath the willow's quiet shade. 
Close the shutters, &e. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead; 
Death has claimed him now ; 
Never more his smile will shed 
Sunshine on poor mother's brow. 
She is almost broken-heirted, 
And our home is sad to-day; 
Life has lost its hope and joy, 
Since our Willie's gone away. 
Close the shutters, &c.

Words by Arairtia W. FRENCH. 
Music by CIIAR. D. 13L.44E. 
I am coming, darling, coming, 
Down the dear old shady lane ; 
Tho' the birds and bees are humming, 
Yet my heart is filled with pain: 
For I 
know that I 
will miss you, 
Something softly tells me so ; 
So I'm coming, just to kiss you 
Once again before you go. 
Cnonus. 
I 
am coining, for I'll miss you, 
When you wander to and fro ; 
I 
am coming, just to kiss you, 
Once again before you go. 
I- am coming, for to-morrow, 
'you'll be wandering afar, 
And the thought brings pain and sorrow, 
Since I've learned how dear you are ; 
Smiles of thine no more may cheer me, 
But in mem'ry sweet and low, 
Tho'ts of thee will linger near me, 
As you wander to and fro. 
I 
am coming, &C. 
am coming where you wander, 
'Neath the shadows down the lane ; 
And I 
dreamed of days o'er yonder, 
When in joy we meet again ; 
Future years will keep no sadness, 
In their store for you and me.; 
All the days shall smile with gladness, 
When our hearts united be. 
I 
am coming, &c.

Home of my heart, my native land V. 
In fancy still my steps were here, 
Home of my heart, my native land t 
I've found the home so fondly sought, 
And weep, but these are joyous tears, 
The rapture of a 
moment bought, 
By long and weary absent years. 
Oh, how I 
love thee, & e.

MARCH OF THE CAMERON MEN. 
AS 
sung by ALICE BENNETT. 
The words of this Song are published annonymously, and from 
their extreme martial character many would suppose them to be 
the production of some enthusiastic Highlander ; the absence of 
the writer's name might, at first, be intended to favor that conclu-
sion ; but now it is generally ascribed to the accomplished Author-
ess of the " Lays from Strathern." The music is original and very 
effective. 
There's many a 
man of the Cameron Clan 
That has followed his chief to the field, 
He has sworn to support him or die by his side, 
For a 
Cameron never can yield. 
CHORUS. 
I 
hear the Pibroch sounding, 
Sounding deep o'er the mountains and glens, 
While light springing footsteps are tramp'ling the heath, 
'Tis the march of the Cameron men. 
Oh, proudly they walk, but each Cameron knows, 
He may tread on the heather no more; 
But boldly he follows his Chief to the field, 
Where his laurels were gather'd before. 
I 
hear, &c. 
The moon has arisen, it shines on that path. 
Now trod by the gallant and true, 
High, high are their hopes, for their Chieftan has said, 
That what ever men dare they can do. 
I 
hear, &c.

darling, 
Yes, I'll meet thee at the elder near the tree, 
For your heart to me is so true, I 
am longing to caress you, 
As in spring time, when we used to cross the lea ; 
The pah) moon so full and swelling, it would light you from 
your dwelling, 
So remember, :Hattie dearest, meet me there, 
And a 
show'r of loving kisses!will help constitute our 
blisses, 
While I 
nestle beds of roses in your hair. 
CHORUS. 
When the whippoorwill is calling, sweetly calling, Mattis 
darling, 
When the whippoorwill is calling, whippoorwill. 
When the stars begin to twinkle, and the dews begin to 
sprinkle, 
I 
will meet thee at the call of whippoorwill. 
When the whippoorwill is calling, and the dew is softly 
falling, 
I 
will press thee to my bosom, :Hattie dear, 
For your flowing, golden tresses, and your loving warm 
caresses, 
I 
do cherish so, and long to have them near; 
Then the tiny stars will twinkle, and the dew the grass will 
sprinkle, 
While the fire-fly shows at intervals its light, 
So remember, Alattie darling, when the whippoorwill is 
calling, 
You must meet me with your smiling face so bright.

We sat by the river, you and I ! 
In the sweet summer time long ago. 
So smoothly the water glided by, 
Making music in its tranquil flow; 
We threw two leaflets, you and I, 
To the river, as it wander'd on, 
And one was rent and left to die, 
And the other floated forward all alone, 
And oh! we were sadden'd, you and I! 
For we felt that our youth's golden dream 
Might fade, and our lives be sever'd soon, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream ! 
'Tis years since we parted, you and I ! 
In that sweet summer time, long ago. 
And I 
smile as I 
pass the river by, 
And I 
gaze into the shadow depths below. 
I 
look on the grass's and bending reeds, 
And I 
listen to the soothing song, 
And I 
envy the calm and happy life 
Of the river, as it sings and flows along, 
For oh! how its song brings back to me 
The shade of our youth's golden dream! 
In the days ere we parted, you and I, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream!

"PLEASE GOD, MAKE ROOM FOR 
A 
LITTLE BOY !" 
As sung by ALICE BENNETT. 
(These were the last words of " Americus," the well-known child 
violinist, Fey( n 
years of a!7e, who expired very suddenly during the 
night of January 1Cth. 1874, in Boston. 
So quietly did his spirit 
take its flight that his father, who occupied the same room, although 
hearing his son make the foregoing exclamation, thought the boy 
was talking in his sleep, and was horrified to find the little child 
cold in death, in the morning. )

" 
Good-night, father 1" said our darling, 
As he sank to sweet repose ; 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music, 
Died away at twilight's close : 
And a 
smile came o'er his features, 
Radiant with holy joy, 
As if angels came to whisper 
Tidings to our little boy. 
" 
Good-night, father!" said our darling, 
As he sank to sweet repose ; 
Like a

When night draped her sable curtain, 
Hanging folds upon each star, 
Came a 
halo soft and lustrous, 
Streaming e'er the window bar : 
And we heard our darling murmur, 
As the brightness lit his face, 
"Please God, make me room in Heaven, 
Make your little boy a

Good-night, father !" said our darling, 
As he sank to sweet repose ; 
Like a 
bird, his gleeful music 
Died away at twilight's close. 
" 
Good-night, father !" &C. 
He was weary of the struggle, 
Discords jarred upon his soul ; 
And his gentle spirit left us, 
Wafted to the heavenly goal ; 
He has room among the angels, 
He is freed from sin and care : 
God, who watcheth e'en the sparrow, 
Answer'd little Jimmie's prayer.

Music by H. BoLucial. 
Fly across the ocean, birdie, 
Fly beyond that gloomy sea ; 
There you'll find a 
truant lover, 
Who has pledged his life to me. 
Tell him how my heart was aching, 
Aching that I 
gave him pain ; 
That my pride will not allow him 
To recall those words again. 
Cnor.us. 
Birdie, Birdie, Darling birdie, 
Do not tarry on the way; 
When you hear the ocean murmur, 
Birdie, birdie fly away. 
Take with you this glossy ringlet, 
Place it on his bosom bare ; 
Tell him, birdie, to remember, 
How my curls have nestled there. 
Let him call to mind the moments, 
When our hearts were both so free, 
When he pledged his life forover, 
Unto me, yes, unto me. 
Birdie, birdie, &C. 
Let him think how once he falter'd, 
Near the window, by my side, 
When he ask'd me would I 
love him ? 
When he ask'd me for his bride ? 
Fly away, now birdie, darling, 
Stay no more to hear me sigh ; 
There now, bless you, birdie, bless you, 
Bear my message through the sky, 
Birdie, birdie,

Oh, come, little darling, and fly to this breast, 
And let your brown curls in tranquillity rest ; 
The spring of my life on your image is shed, 
And happiness truly shines over your head ; 
There's none that is clearer, oh, list what I

For you are a

Oh, love, let me kiss, ckc. 
Oh, love, may a 
sorrow ne'er wither thy face,

There's none that is fonder, more bright than the day, 
None half so bewitching, as Maggie McKay. 
Oh, love, let me kiss, dEc.

Darling, linger at my side, 
While the moments by us glide ; 
Time and care have marked your brow, 
But you're dearer to me now ; 
Lay your hand within my own, 
We, together, old have grown ; 
Brighter far than gems untold, 
Silver hair that once was gold. 
CHORITS. 
Down tho hill of life we go, 
Love but gleams with brighter glow; 
Sweeter far than gems untold, 
Silver hair that once was gold. 
Beaming eyes that gaze in mine, 
Ah! how fondly now they shine! 
Roses of the heart remain, 
Though they fade on hill and plain! 
Loving ones cannot forget 
Happy days when tint they met ; 
Fondly now each tress of gold, 
Silver hair that once was gold. 
Down the hill, Sce 
Life together we will share, 
Every joy and every care ; 
'Till we slumber side by side, 
In the church-yard drear and wide! 
Give me back each fond caress, 
Once again your lips I

morning 
In the distant long ago. 
When hope smil'd on my life's dawning, 
For I 
knew nor care nor woe. 
By my side their tripp'd a 
maiden 
Passing fair and dreaming eyed. 
Rosy smiles and eyes love laden 
Reveard thought, her tongue denied. 
Dreaming eyes ! Dreaming eyes! 
Dreaming eyes of long ago. 
Dreaming eyes ! Dreaming eys ! 
Dreaming eyes of long ago, 
I 
recall so well that olden, 
Ever unforgotten time ; 
It was in the glorious, golden 
Merry laughing summer's prime; 
After summer came December, 
Roses perished in the snow ; 
While I 
live, I 
must remember 
Dreaming eyes of long ago. 
Dreaming eyes! Dreaming eyes : 
Dreaming eyes of long ago. 
Dreaming eyes ! Dreaming eye.,: 
Dreaming eyes of long ago.

LITTLE MAGGIE MAY. 
THE spring had come, the flowers in bloom, 
The birds sung out their lay, 
Down by a 
little running brook, 
I 
first saw Maggie May. 
She had a 
roguish jet black eye, 
Was singing all the day; 
And how I 
loved her"none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
CHORUS. 
My little witching Maggie, 
Maggie singing all the day; 
Oh! how I 
love her, none can tell, 
My little Maggie May 
Though years rolled on, yet still I 
loved, 
With heart so light ..nd gay, 
And never,will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gone, 
And death would take away, 
Still by my sin did linger one— 
And that was Maggie May. - 
My little witching, ttc. 
May heaven protect me for her sake, 
I 
pray both night awl day, 
That I, ere long, may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May. 
For she is all the world to me, 
Although I'm far away, 
I 
oft times think of the running brool 
And my little Maggie Nay. •

little witching, &c,

Little voices sweetly calling, 
Calling Mamma, all the day, 
Oh, it's sweet to hear the darlings— 
Hear the cunning words they say ; 
There is music in their prattle, 
Comfort in their happy glee, 
And it is a 
joy to kiss them, 
Or to hold them on our knee. 
CHORUS. 
Little voices sweetly calling, 
Calling Mamma all the day, 
Oh, it's sweet to hear the darlings, 
Hear tile cunning words they say. 
Pretty faces ever smiling, 
Smiling sweetly all the day, 
Oh, it is so nice to watch them— 
Watch our angel doves at play ; 
From the early morn ' till twilight, 
Cheerful as the merry birds, 
They are calling one another 
In the sweetest kind of words. 
Little voices, 41c. 
Tiny feet that never weary 
Going up and down the stairs, 
Little minds that are not troubled 
With a 
score of worldly cares ; 
Home without them would be dreary, 
Minutes lengthen into hours, 
If the garden of our household 
Had not these delightful flow'rs.

As sung by JENNIE Mono.Lx. 
Mut41c to be had of Wm. A. POND Si: Co., 547 Broadway. 
Price 30 Ot5, 
High in my window two love-birds 
Hung in their cage for a 
summer long; 
Their passion had not the relief of words, 
And they did not appear to know a 
song ; 
But there they nestled upon the perch, 
to beak in a 
loveable way, 
Like two young lovers just fresh from church, 
And a 
look in their eyes that seemed to say— 
Cnonvs. 
Hours go by 
Let them fly 
We'll mark them with a 
kiss. 
Hours go by 
Let them fly 
The time we pass in kissing, 
The time we pass in kissing 
Is time we r!evr miss. 
My bird's example spread'far and wide ; 
There in the window they kiss'd and coo'd, 
'Till it soften'd the hearts of folks outside, 
And quite affected the neighborhood ; 
And love grew in fashion more and yet more; 
All thro' the terrace flirtation so rag'd, 
That no one of twenty, few of two score, 
But was either just wed or else engaged. 
CrioRus.

I

Take our delight in this.

My aged Granny, a 
prim old dame, 
Was wholly perturb'd at their wooing ways: 
What forward things, I 
am 1111'd with shame, 
No birds so acted in my young days, 
Their brazen immodesty pray disown, 
And send the creatures at once to roost; 
You ought to provide them a 
chaperone, 
And see them properly introduced. 
Chorus as before. 
At last came some one to see the birds ; 
Somebody came, I 
won't tell who, 
But lie begg'd them of me with pleading words ; 
Ask'd for them and their mistress too: 
And some how, I 
and that foolish man, 
Tho' how it happen'd I 
cannot swear, 
Agreed to follow the Love-bird's plan, 
And make two couples instead of a 
pair. 
Chorus as before.

I 
long for the home of the dear little shamrock, 
The mountain and meadow, that sparkle with dew 
Since last I 
beheld you my heart has been weary, 
I've thought of you, darling by night and by day; 
And often in dreams I 
have tried to caress you, 
And you, my dear Barney, so far, far away.

I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
I'm longing for you, and those bright auburn curls 
I

The valleys, the rivers, and rosy cheekd girls ; 
The Lakes of Killarney are shining before me, 
Their sweet placid waters are bright as of yore, 
And often I 
think I 
am walking beside you, 
And talking of love by the lake's pleasant shore. 
Ah! I'll go back to Erin, S[c. 
I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
So darling, be ready to welcome me there ; 
I

The marriage that makes us the happiest pair ; 
The lark and the cuckoo will greet my arrival, 
The nightingale, too, will respond with a 
lay; 
And Varney, remember, be ready to meet me, 
For Barney, my love, I'll be soon on the way.

Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me,

Thu NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL THE 
WELL RUNS DRY 
WHEN a 
child I 
lived at Lincoln with my parents at the farm, 
lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm; 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of childish 
play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mother 
say— 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach; 
Let your watchword be " dispatch," and practice what you 
preach; 
Do not let your chances, like sunbeams, pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs .dry. 
Is years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seem'd my only sport, it was my only joy; 
And well do I 
remember, when ofttimes well chastised, 
flow father sat beside me then and thus has me advised. 
Waste not, &c. 
When I 
arrived at manhood, I 
embark'd in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road bestrewn with care and strife; 
I 
speculated foolishly. my losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny, little voice kept whisp'ring in mine ear. 
Waste not, &c. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, and found, to my surprise, 
My funds, instead of sinking, very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasp'd each chance and always struck the iron while ' twat 
hot, 
I 
seiz'd my opportunities and never once forgot— 
Waste not, &e.„ 
Im' married now and happy , I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony, devoid of care and strife; 
Portune smiles upon us, we have little children three, 
Vhe lessons that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee 
Is, waste not. &c.

Upon a 
rustic bridge we met 
One afternoon in Spring; 
His loving words I 
can't forget, 
Within my ears they ring! 
The swans were sailing on the Lake, 
And all the Park was gay; 
My hand in his he chanced 1 
e 
take 
In such a 
charming way! 
The flowers were bright, lint oh, his eyes 
They shone like stars of night! 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delight. 
I 
seem'd in love's delicious dream, 
My heart with rapture beat ; 
And while his eyes did on me beam, 
I 
heard his lips repeat : 
Cnonos. 
There is no harm in kissing. 
Pray tell me, is there, dear ? 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting, 
No prying eyes to mark, 
There is no harm in kissing, (a 
kiss) 
At twilight in the Park! 
We strolled along where roses grew, 
And all was bright and fair ; 
He promised ever to be true, 
And begged my love to share. 
The little birds were flying home, 
They heard my lips reply; 
And stars were bright in yonder dome 
Before we say good bye. 
But oh, he seemed so sad to leave— 
My heart grew sad as well, 
For love within each heart did weave 
Its dear bewitching spell ! 
We lingered, though the hour was late, 
How quick the time had sped! 
But when our lips met at the gate, 
He softly to me said: 
There is no harm, leo.

Why cold to-day? once I

Then thy heart stirred and flushed thy brow; 
Never a

Now thy hand lies listless in mine

Cold as if we never had met ;

Speak to me, speak— 
Be my heart heard, or it will break, 
For one kind word; 
No vows to bind, no pledge I 
seek, 
Only be kind—speak to me, speak. 
One idle day thou did'st deplore 
Some castaway, on desert shore; 
'Twits but a 
tale, by poet feigned, 
Yet thou did'st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan---sad, sad to be 
Utterly lone, by the bleak sea; 
My life is drear, I, cast away— 
Give me the tear thou slaed'st that day.

And death alone our love shall part;

The lily has replaced the rose, 
But still you are to me as clear, 
Your voice is just as sweet and clear.

Drunkard's Lone Child. 
OUT in this gloomy night sadly I 
roam, 
I've no mother now, no friends, no home, 
Nobody cares for me, no one would cry, 
Even if poor little Bessie should die. 
Barefoot and tired I've wandered all day, 
Asking for work, but I'm too small, they say. 
On the damp ground. I 
must now lay my head, 
Father's a 
drunkard. and mother is dead. 
Crionus. 
Mother, why did you leave mo alone, 
With no one to love me, no friends and no home. 
Dark is the night, the storm rages wild, 
God pity Bessie, the Drunkard's Lone Child. 
We were so happy till father drank rum, 
Then all our trouble and sorrow begun. 
Mother grew paler and wept every day, 
Baby and I 
were too hungry to play. 
Slowly they faded, and one summer night 
Found their sweet faces all silent and white. 
And with big tears sloNtly dropping I 
said, 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
Oh ! if some temp•rance man only could find. 
Poor, wretched father and speak very kind, 
If they could. stop him from drinking, why then 
I 
should feel very happy again. 
Is it too late ? 
Men of temp'rance, please try, 
For little Bessie will soon starve and die.

Little Charlie nos ,, 
four years of age, was stolen from his hona in 
Philadel l,hia. July 1st. 
His abductors cffer to restore the child 
on payment of twenty thousand dollars! 
If tho wretches who 
kidnapped him succeed in getting their blood money, every home 
is liable to be thus stricken. The whole country sympathizes 
with the bereaved parents. 
Within our home garden we had a 
sweet bud 
That promised to blossom in love, 
So deep had its tendrils grown into our hearts, 
We thought that our father above 
Would spare him to solace the last of our years; 
Alas! he is stolen away! 
And now we are mourning for our darling child. 
We watch, and we wait, and we pray. 
CHORUS. 
0 
bring back our darling, the light of our home, 
'Tis cruel our loved cues to part, 
For tho' you may steal him from out of our arms. 
He still will remain in the heart 
We listen to hear the sweet tones of his voice, 
We watch for his bright smiling face, 
And moodily dream of the golden days past, 
Those visions Time cannot efface. 
The sound of his footstep yet echo • 
His toys still remain here as then 
But he is not with us, our fond arms yet yearn, 
Our tears now are falling like rain!

bring back our darling, dc.c. 
Oh ! Father in Heaven, please hear thou our pray'r t 
Pray soften the hearts of those men, 
Who robbed us of one who is dearer than all, 
To bring back our darling again. 
How gladly we'd welcome our dear boy once more,. 
And press him in joy to our heart! 
Oh! heed our petition, bid sorrow to flee, 
And darkness forever depart!

When ev'ning brings the twilight hour, 
I 
pass a 
lonely spot, 
Where oft she comes to cull the flower, 
We call " Forget me not." 
She never whisper so, nor stay, 
She never whispers go, nor stay, 
We meet by chance,— the usual way, 
We meet by chance,—the usual way, 
We meet by chance, 
We meet by chance, 
We meet by chance,—the usual way. 
Once, how, I 
cannot well divine, 
Unless by chance, we kisst ; 
I 
found her lips were close to mine, 
So I 
could not resist ; 
As neither whispered yea nor nay, 
As neither whispered yea nor nay, 
They met by chance—the usual way, 
They met by chance —the usual way.

'The roses, when the zephyrs woo, 
Lapart what they receive—

But never whisper give. 
Our love is mutual, this we know,

lhough neither tells the other so, 
Though neither tells the other so,

THE MAOGREGORS' GATHERING. 
As sung by ALICE BENNETT. 
Written by W ALTER SCOTT. 
Music by ALEX. LEE. 
The moon's on the Lake, and the mist's on the brae, 
And the clan has a 
name that is nameless by day, 
Our signal for fight which from monarchs we drew, 
Must be heard but by night in our vengeful haloo. 
CHORUS. 
Then haloo, haloo, halloo Gregalaeh, 
If they rob us of name and pursue us with Beagles, 
Give their roofs to the flame and their flesh to the Eagles. 
Then gather, gather, gather, gather, gather, gather, 
While there's leaves in the forest, and foam on the river, 
Macgregor despite them shall flourish forever. 
Glenorchy's proud mountain, Colchurn and her towers, 
Glenstrae and Glenlyon no longer are ours, 
We're landless, landless, landless, 
Gregalach, landless landless, landless. 
hro' the depths of Loch Kathrine the steed shall career, 
O'er the 'peak of Benlomond the galley shall steer, 
And the rocks of Craig Royston, like icicles melt, 
Ere our wrongs he forgot, or our vengeance unfelt. 
Then haloo, &c. 
THE WEARING OF THE GREEN. 
As sung by ALICE BENNETT. 
Oh 1 
Paddy, dear, and did you hear the news that's goin' 
round, 
The shamrock is forbid by law to grow on Irish ground; 
Saint Patrick's day no more we'll keep, his color can't be 
seen, 
For there's a 
bloody law agin, the wearin' o' the green ? 
I 
met with Napper Tandy and he Wk me by the hand, 
And he said " how's poor ould Ireland, and how does she 
stand ?" 
She's the most distressful country that ever you have seen; 
They're hanging men and women there for • Wearin' o' 
the Green l" 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
Then since the Color we must wear is England's cruel red, 
Sure Ireland's sons will ne'er forget the blood that they 
have shed; 
You may take the Shamrock from your.hut, and cast it on. 
the sod, 
But ' twill take root and flourish st ill, tho' under foot 'tis trod 
When the law can stop the blades of grass from growing 
as they grow, 
And when the leaves in summer time their verdure dare 
not show; 
Then I 
will change the color I 
wear in my corbeen; 
But ' till that day, please God, I'll stick to 
NVearin' o' the 
Green." 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
But if at last our color should be torn from Ireland's heart, 
Her sons with shame and sorrow from the dear old soil will 
part ; 
I've heard whisper of a 
country that lies far beyant the say, 
Where rich and poor stand equal in the light of freedom's 
day; 
Oh, Erin must we lave you, driven by the tyrant's hand, 
Must we ask a 
mother's welcome from a 
strange but hap-
pier land ? 
Where the cruel cross of England's thraldom never shall 
be seen, 
And where, thank God, we'll live and die, still ‘. Wearin'' 
o' the Green."

And sung by Miss ADA W DAY 
thinking now of olden times, 
When you and I 
were young, 
>f the school- house porch where oft we played, 
The many songs we sung ; 
The small green plot before the door. 
Where oft we skipped and run, 
In childhood's merry happy days, 
When you and I 
were young. 
Of the village church whose silver- chimes, 
lie- echoed throng- it the dell, 
The moss- grown rock of olden times, 
That stood beside the well; 
The creeping ivy evergreen, 
To the ruined mill it hung, 
In childhood's merry happy days, 
When you and I 
were young. 
The village church has passed away, 
The bells no more resound, 
The ivy from the ruined mill 
Lies scattered on the ground ; 
The school-house porch, where oft we played, 
With laughter, how it rung, 
Is changed, alas, like everything, 
ince you and I 
were young. 
As sung with great success by Gni". W. Weis-I:mum 
I 
am thinking now of home among my native hills, 
And though afar through distant lands I 
roam, 
The memories of the past my heart with longing fills,' 
To see the darling little ones at home. 
Au ! now their forms I 
seem to see, 
Far o'er the rolling ocean's foam, 
And hear their voices ringing in merry childish glee,: 
Oh! I 
long to see the little ones at home.

Arid hear their voices ringing in merry childish glee, 
Oh! I

LAST TIME. 
Soon shall I 
hear your voices in merry childish glee, 
Proclaim the joyous welcome welcome home. 
The moon looks mildly down the same as oft before, 
And bathes the earth in floods of mellow light, 
But its beams are not so bright upon this lonely shore, 
As they seemed at home one year ago to night. 
Sadly my heart still turns to thee, 
Wherever I 
may chance to roam, 
I 
hear your voices ringing in merry childish glee ; 
Oh! I 
long to see the little ones at home. 
The little ones at home, °WK. 
May guardian angels still their vigils o'er thee keep, 
May heaven's choicest blessings on thee rest, 
Till I 
am safely borne across the stormy deep, 
And meet again with those I 
love the best. 
Soon, soon your faces I 
shall see, 
Never, never more font thee to roam, 
soon shall I 
hear your voices in merry childish glee 
Proclaim tho joyous welcome, welcome home.

The little stars sat, one by one, 
Each on its golden throne. 
The evening wind passed by my cheek, 
The leaves above were stirred, 
But the beating of my own heart

In a 
little white cottage where the trees are ever green, 
And the climbing roses blossom by the door, 
I've often sat and listened to the music of the birds, 
And the gentle voice of pretty Nettie Moore. 
CHours. 
Oh, I 
miss you, Nettie Moore, 
And my happiness is o'er, 
While a 
spirit sad around my heart has come, 
And the busy days are long, 
And the nights are lonely now 
For you are gone from our little cottage home. 
Below us in the valley. on the Santee's dancing tide, 
Of a 
Summer eve I'd launch my open boat ; 
And when the moon was rising and the stars began to shine, 
Down the river we so merrily would float. 
Oh, I 
miss you, &cc. 
One sunny morn in Autumn, ere the dew had left the lawn 
Came a 
trader up from Louisiana bay ; 
Who gave to master money, and then shackl'd her with 
chains. 
And then he took her off t'o work her life away. 
Oh, I 
miss you, S:c. 
Since that time the world is dreary, and I 
long from earth 
to rise. 
And join the happy angels gone before, 
I 
never can be merry. for my heart is full of woe, 
And I'm pining for my pretty Nettie Moore. 
Oh, I 
miss you, 
You are gone, lovely Nettie, and my heart must surely 
break. 
When the tears come no more into my eyes; 
But when weary life is past. I 
shall meet you once again, 
In Heaven, darling, up above the skies.

reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor 
twaate Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spider came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords tv 
Uriking example that vice, however prosperous in the be-
tinning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
No one iho has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes cf Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable rrom Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal of the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy Temple. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and rair resulting from once yizE-
ing to the seductive intmer.ce of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in rapt attention to the end.

THE APPRENTICE, - 
OR 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE.

2mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical me.thsnics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts: The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1881, was in need of a 
text-
boo 't 
of practical m,-chanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his roquirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted' and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
ref:data/ice to motion, strain on material, etc.—Manufacticrer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
The author of this work is well known as an extensive 
writer who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply- a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great ad vantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text- book, but also as a work 
of reference. 
Most ambitions young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might bo advantageously 
introduced into more ambitions works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white p 
iper. and bound in still cloth covers.
