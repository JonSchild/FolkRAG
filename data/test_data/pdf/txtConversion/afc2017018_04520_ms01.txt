P: 
And action [laughs]! 
I: 
Almost. 
P: 
Wait. I said that before it started. 
I: 
We’ll get ‘em both going. Okay. You ready? 
I2: 
Yup. 
I: 
You ready? 
P: 
Yup. 
I: 
Everybody’s ready. 
P: 
Ready to go. 
I: 
All right. Well, let’s start then, and we’ll start by saying thank you. Thank you so much for agreeing to do 
this. I know it’s a chunk of time. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
But I feel the work that you ‘re doing is important. K does as well. And we want to let the world know 
what you do. Part of the reason for doing this project is to try to explain to people what personal care 
assistant’s work is all about and what it’s like to do it? Ad what kind of life you live as a personal care worker. 
So, let’s get started. I’m going to jump right in, and I want to start with asking you how you got into this kind of 
work. If you could just give us some history on how you entered it and why? 
P: 
Okay. I kinda fell into it. I was [21.36] living with my grandmother when I was maybe about 20. She was 
getting on in years, and my grandfather had passed away, and he went through a long illness and had hit his 
head and had brain damage. So, she had been under a tremendous amount of strain, and she was in her 80s, 
and I think it really took a toll on her. And then I moved in with her in her house, which was in Royal Oak, which 
is close by to where I lived, and she began to become sick. And I noticed things were happening to her, and I 
said to my mother I said, mom, I said there’s somethin’ goin’ on with grandma. I said she’s just not the same, 
so we took her in for tests and everything else, and she had Lou Gehrig’s Disease. And the doctor also told us 
that she was having signs of dementia. So, she was getting hit with both of those at the same time, and I was 
maybe 20 years old. And I had never really experienced anything, so I was kind of thrown into it. I wasn’t the 
chief cook and bottle washer there, but I did live there often and was very concerned with my grandmother’s 
health. And I think that what made it so special is that we had the same birthday, and I was always very, very 
close to her from the time I grew up until that time. So, her condition got worse and worse and worse, and she 
became more and more weak. And I was strong enough to handle her at night. I worked, but I handled her at 
night. We had caregivers coming in during the day—people that called themselves nurses, which at that time 
nobody really checked to see who they really were. There was no background checks or anything like that, so 
we had some good ones; we had some pretty bad ones. So, I got to know about caregiving at a fairly early 
age. That was 40 years ago, so I know from that time what care giving was about. I knew what was good, what 
was bad. I knew what happened to people that were very sick, and it was very, very hard because of the fact 
that she was my grandmother and I knew her so well. So, that was my baptism of fire so to speak, and then I 
went on to get married and divorced and had a son, and I moved out west, and I got a job working for the 
army. It wasn’t enough for me [18.56]. You know, we needed money. I had a girlfriend. We needed money, so 
we opened up an adult family home, and we had clients that were all male. Basically, state-paid clients. They 
were pretty low pay, but we made enough money at that, and I worked. And we did pretty well, but it was too 
much strain on both of us. We stopped that, and we kept just one client. He lived with us for 23 years, so I had

23 years of caregiving experience with one client, in an adult family home, I also worked outside the home, and 
I also did caregiving outside the home. So, I’ve always been a very busy person. I love to work. I love to just 
work, but caregiving to me was an escape from the drudgery of taking care of one person all the time every 
day. I got away from him by doing that. I got away from my other job mentally because of the fact that I was 
doing something completely different, and I was doing something that I knew how to do so it was easy for me 
to do that job because of the fact that I had so much experience with caregiving. So, I did that for a long time, 
and I worked in many different situations. I worked for probably three different companies. I always worked for 
an agency. It’s easier. I like to work for agencies because they do all the stuff that I don’t like to do. They go 
find the clients. They go, they dig ‘em up. They set the schedule. They do all the things that are just sheer 
drudgery to me [17.10]. I wanna just take care of the client. That’s all I want to do. That’s what I love to do, but I 
don’t like to take care of all of the dealing with the family, and all that stuff. I don’t like to do that. So, that’s my 
experience with caregiving. I can go into a lot of detail. I took care of many different kinds of clients. I took care 
of community protection, which were people that had done usually sexual crimes, but had too low of an IQ to 
be put into jail. Basically, that is what I would say happened. They were not capable of going into the general 
population of prison, so they put ‘em in homes, and they were watched one on one. So, I did a lot of that kinda 
work, pretty much weekends. And I worked for another company that had a couple of group homes. I worked in 
group homes, which had as many as 10 clients. I had to take care of 10 clients. I used to be the med intake 
guy. They liked it because I was pretty detail oriented and I could do that and not make too many mistakes. In 
fact, I would catch the doctors’ mistakes, so I liked to do that. I love to catch doctors makin’ mistakes. It’s fun, 
and you call the doctor’s office, and they say, “No. We didn’t do that.” I said, well, it’s right here on the paper, 
so I loved to do that kind of a thing. I do like paperwork. I mean working for the Department of the Army for a 
long time, you get used to doing things like that, and it was fun for me to do that. But I also liked to interact with 
the clients too and having 10 clients is a real handful. I used to take them to activity club in the van. I would be 
responsible for all 10 of ‘em in the van. Wheelchairs and people that had limited mobility and all this sort of 
thing, and I’d take ‘em to activity club and take ‘em home. I finally ended up in Washington state. I took care of 
a lot of clients that had substance abuse issues. Not necessarily very much dementia. Most of the people that I 
took care of were fairly healthy. They weren’t in wheelchairs and walkers and that sort of thing. Some 
developmentally disabled clients as well. So, that’s my general experience. 
I: 
Aside from the Army job, it sounds like you had the client that was living with you at home, and then 
you took a lot of personal care work jobs with different agencies over the years. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Okay. And you described it as an escape. So, you were escaping from caregiving by doing caregiving? 
P: 
Yes, but uh [pause] the client that lived in our house was very difficult to take care of. He had a seizure 
disorder. He had behavior problems. I didn’t collect any of the money for that work. I gave that to my girlfriend. 
That was her job. You know, we shared in the—in the house paying for the expenses in the house, but that 
was her client—her name, but I did the work, a lot of the work anyway. And going away to work for another 
client or another agency or something like that, it gave me my own little pocket money, my own little stash, so 
to speak of  - money that I could use that was rewarding myself separate from a regular job. And I found out 
that I really, really liked it. I really enjoyed it. 
I: 
Tell me what—you said you love the work. Tell me what you love about it? 
P: 
[Pause] well, this is such a general comment, but I just love people. I like people. I also like to help 
people that are in need. It’s—I’m a Christian, so I have a lot of those values in me, and I take it to heart, and I 
try to take care of people that are less fortunate than myself. Be it whatever is wrong with them, I try to help 
them in a way that’s not overbearing [12.30], and that makes me feel comfortable because I know there’s 
people out there that are worse off than me, and when you see that you realize how fortunate you really are. If 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Richard Dusenbury. 5.22.18

you’re taking care of people that are less fortunate than you, you feel a lot better about your own situation 
however bad that may be at that time. 
I: 
Checking the recording real quick here. You also mentioned you are sort of project-oriented. You like 
hands-on projects, and problem solving—catching doctors’ mistakes, things like that. 
P: 
Yeah. I do. It’s summertime, and as a caregiver I can’t—I’m not allowed to make too much money as a 
caregiver, but I do like to help a lot of my friends out with their projects at home. I’m very handy. I do projects 
around the house. Even when I get into a client’s house and I find something that’s broken, I just love to fix it 
because they have been probably looking at that problem—that broken vase for 2 years, and all of a sudden, 
you’ve got a guy that comes in here and says, well, I can fix that. And with the down time that I have I’ll fix 
things for people. Just little things. You know, nothing major, but that immediately can give you a good rapport 
with your client. And I’ll call ‘em clients I guess. I’ve been told that they’re—and I hate this word—consumers. I 
absolutely detest that word. 
I: 
Why don’t you like that term? 
P: 
[Sigh] consumer to me is a user of utilities. I remember the company called Consumer’s Power was out 
here, and I always think of it as that—Consumer’s Power—it’s a utility. You’re not a person, you’re a 
commodity. I’m not providing a commodity, I’m providing personal care. And there’s a difference to me 
between personal care and a commodity. It is a commodity [10.10]. Personal care is so much more. 
I: 
Can you explain that to me? 
P: 
Personal care is being there for a person when they really, really need you, and when a commodity 
doesn’t make it to them, the lights go out; there’s no gas; there’s a power failure, and how much care does that 
company have when they go out there to fix it? They’re happy to have it back on, but you’re not gonna get 
somebody out there to personally say, “I’ll fix that for you right now. Let’s fix this right now.” You’ll never get 
that with a commodity. Personal care is not a commodity to me. It’s more a—it’s a service. It’s a dedication to 
what you do to help other people, and you have to have it in your heart to be able to do that. 
I: 
Can you describe for me what it is that you do when you go to people’s homes? What kind of service 
do you provide? 
P: 
Well, it all depends upon the client itself. There’s many people with disabilities, and most of the people 
are disabled in some way. That’s why I’m there, and what do I do? That depends entirely upon the client. What 
is their issue? What is their disability? What do they need from me? Is it companionship? Are they able to take 
care of their own home, but they just don’t quite have it together enough to live comfortably? Do they need to 
have more severe—and they have more severe problems? Do they need more urgent care? Or do they have 
to have their briefs changed? Do they have an ostomy bag? Do they have—do they need to be catheterized? 
What is it exactly that they need? And it varies so much, but I think to say what do I do, is such a huge 
question, that I really can’t answer it in any one instance because every single client that I have is different. 
Their needs are different. Their personalities are different, so I can’t really say. I can’t answer the question in 
one answer. It’s gonna be 25 answers, too many. 
I: 
You moved back to Michigan to be closer to your mother. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Does she need care right now? 
P: 
No. Absolutely not [laughing]. She’s 85 years old. She’s very involved in her church. She works at the 
Detroit Institute of Arts. She’s very active in many, many things [7.20]. A lot of things from school when she 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Richard Dusenbury. 5.22.18

went to Michigan State. She’s involved in her sorority. What is that that she’s into? I don’t know some kind of a 
scholarship committee for young women. She’s involved in that. She’s a very modern person. I look up to her a 
lot because I really can’t keep up with her. I mean I work and everything, but she does too. And it’s hard for me 
to keep up with her because she’s so busy, so. 
I: 
Once you moved back, you got a job here. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
With an agency—home care and staffing agency. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And are you working part-time/full-time, how many clients do you have right now? 
P: 
Right, now, I presently have two. I have—I guess I can say this. I have a doctor and her husband [6.26], 
which I’ve been taking care of since January off and on. I’ve had some health issues. I had a month off not of 
my choice. Arcadia [home care agency/employer] has worked with me very well, with my problem, and I’ve had 
these people for quite a while, and I’ve gotten to know them pretty well. They’re interesting people to take care 
of. They’re demanding, but I don’t mind that because I like it when people tell me what they want. It makes my 
job easier when they’re able to communicate with me and say, I want this done. Yes, I want that done. And I 
can say, okay, I’ll do it. I have another person that I take care of that’s a little more vague. He’s got dementia. 
Not too bad, kind of an early-onset dementia, and he’s a little more difficult to take care of for me because he’s 
repeating himself constantly. And you have to listen to him, and you have to try to read between the lines with 
the guy. Is he hungry? He’ll say he’s not, but he is, so you have to be able to read that and say, okay, well, let’s 
go get some soup and that kinda thing. So, it’s more of a mental thing right now with these clients, which is 
fine. I’m happy with it. I like that. So. 
I2: 
Can you go deeper into what, you know, there’s a lot of things that you intuit and for a lot of people who 
are not providing care like you do and don’t know that, so you can you describe a little bit more about what 
that—what a demanding client is? 
P: 
A demanding client is one that doesn’t give you an awful lot of time to ponder over things. I actually 
take care of two clients in the same  house, so I have a double client too. And when one of them is not asking 
me to do something the other one is asking me to do something, and there’s a lot of things going on in their 
house, and there’s a lotta family stress that’s going on with the daughter [4.09], and it’s—it can be stressful. 
That part can be very, very stressful. The family—and I find that to be true with a lot of clients is you may have 
no trouble at all with a client, but the moment a family member steps in, you have a big problem, and it’s 
something that you don’t even realize is happening, and it’s just that you’re getting somebody else’s take on it. 
I always try to think of it like that. Is you’re getting somebody else’s take. 
I: 
Can you give an example? Does one come to mind? 
P: 
All right. I’ll give you an example.  A client will be independent enough be able to self-medicate 
themselves, at least, you know, I may be putting a cassette out there for them to pick up their medications, but 
they’re responsible to write down that they’ve taken their medications and who gave it to ‘em, and how many 
pills there were, and what was his blood pressure, and the client forgot to write it down. I thought he wrote it 
down, but he didn’t write it down. And the family member comes in and says, “Well, how come my—how come 
there’s nothing written down?” And I said, well, I thought I saw him writing it down. I said I know that he took his 
pills. “Well, you should be more careful about that.” So, you know, that’s the kind of thing that you get from 
family members because they’re take on it might be totally different than yours. And I hate it because that’s a 
reflection upon me, and to me that’s a med error. That is a medication error, and that is serious, and I take that 
very seriously. And it really hit me hard when that was said to me. That was hard to take because I thought I 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Richard Dusenbury. 5.22.18 
 
4
was doing my job right, and I know that the person received their medications, but I still got chastised because 
nothing was written down. So, that’s the kind of thing that can be very stressful. I find family members to be—
some of them are very good, very supportive, but there are others that are looking for problems in the care of 
their loved one, and they are probably like that I think because they’re entrusting you to take care of their 
elderly parent or their sibling or something like that, and they just don’t trust anybody. They think that 
everybody’s bad, and it gets to be stressful. That’s all I can say is that family members are something that I’m 
very wary of when I’m out there working with the client. That’s very difficult at times because they may only 
come to see their parent once every month. You’ve been taking care of that person every single day. You 
know what’s going on with that client better than the relative does, and you’re not given any credit for that. 
You’re told that you messed up this, you messed up that. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing that? 
And then that can be very hurtful, and it can make you resentful. Not to the person that you’re caring for, but I 
can understand how that might make somebody be resentful to the person they’re caring for because of the 
fact that they’re mad because somebody else is not telling—is telling them that they’re not doing a good 
enough job [0.43] to take care of their elderly parent, and that really hurts a caregiver because they’re trying 
really hard and to be told that you’re not doing a good job by somebody who’s never even there, they probably 
are just waiting for that call from the attorney stating, “Oh, well, you’re gonna get this much money out of the 
deal.” And I’ve even seen a lot of financial abuse by children. That bothers me. 
I: 
We’re going to come back to that in just a few minutes, but I’m going to take a quick break here.  
P: 
Good. Okay [laughing]. 
I: 
You’re doin’ great. [End tape 1]. 
P: 
--oh, you don’t know what’s going on behind the closed door. 
I: 
That’s right. You ready? 
I2: 
Yup. 
I: 
Okay. All right, so R, we’re gonna shift gears just a little bit. I know you have lots of stories to tell. 
You’ve had a lot of experience over the last 40 years, and I was just mentioning that a personal care workers 
go into peoples homes and aren’t always prepared, don’t always know what you’re walkin’ into, and until you 
develop a relationship with that person and take stock of your surroundings it’s really kind of an unknown 
situation, and I’m sure you have faced many, many different situations, and I’m interested in learning a little 
more about some of those situations, but also how do you deal with them? You know, you must have learned 
over the years what works, what doesn’t work, things like that, so I want to throw just a few situations out and 
you can respond and tell me what comes to mind? 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
So, have you ever walked into a situation where you felt unprepared, like it was over your head, or you 
didn’t have enough information to go on? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Tell me about it. 
P: 
I walked into a situation in a group home [22.46] where I met a new client that had moved in. He was a 
young man. I think he was 22-23-years-old. He was 6’4”, and he weighed about 260, and the state had not 
done an assessment on this man. I had no idea what I was running into. He didn’t seem to bother the female 
staff too much, but when I came in the place he was acting a little bit differently. But he’d been kinda bad 
during the day and caused some problems, and they were not going to let him go to this—to the dance. There 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Richard Dusenbury. 5.22.18 
 
5
was gonna be a dance, and he was all excited about going to this dance. And they had told him that he was 
not going to be able to go, and he was very upset. I had no idea what I was dealing with. I had nothing to read. 
I was thrown into that situation, and he was getting violent. And he was a big guy, and much bigger than me. 
I’m not that small, but he was much bigger than me, and he was beginning to shove the other clients around. I 
decided, well, what do I do? I was completely perplexed. I said, okay. It’s not time to call the cops yet, but that 
could come up, but I’m not sure. I had to tell him that he was not going to be going to the dance, and then he 
started running around the house. And he was the size of a linebacker, probably a lineman—probably is that 
big, and he was upset, just running around. The other clients were cowering. They were running and hiding. 
They were very peaceful clients. They were women too, clients—men and women. Somehow, I got the other 
clients into the van to take ‘em to the dance, and he wasn’t gonna go [20.55], and he went out to the van, and 
he was gonna climb in the van. He was gonna go, and I had to try to stop him from doing that, so I’d had 
training in, you know, how to defend myself. What to do in a case where a client got outta hand, but what 
happened to me was completely unexpected. He bit me. He bit me on my arm, and I got bit pretty bad. I don’t 
know how it happened. I let my guard down for a second. I didn’t have a chance, but I’m glad that I was in a 
position where I didn’t get bit somewhere else. He would have bit me on my neck, my face, anything. He was 
gonna bite, so it was because I was in the position that I was in. I turned my side to him so he had to go 
through my arm to get to me, and that’s the only thing that kept me from getting hurt a lot worse. So, it was 
totally unexpected. It was dangerous. I had to get control of the situation, so what I did after that is I made a 
face at him, and I ran, and he chased me away, and he couldn’t catch me. So, that’s how I solved that 
situation, and then somebody called the police and they came out and they got him. So, that’s what you could 
run into. That’s the stuff that you can run into where you don’t know what’s gonna happen. Even if it was 
written down somewhere and there was an assessment done on him, and there was some history of him, I 
don’t think that would have made any difference in this scenario. It was just a really bad situation, and I ran into 
it, and I really didn’t know how to react or do it. And I’m glad it was me that was there and not one of the female 
caregivers that were much smaller than me or less strong or had enough wits about ‘em to draw him away 
from the situation, but that’s what I was trained to do, and I got him away from the other clients. I got him away 
from the other staff long enough to have the police come and get him [18.46].  
I: 
That’s quite a story. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And it actually is a good segue into asking about injuries. I know people are concerned about personal 
care workers potentially injuring clients, not necessarily intentionally, but personal care workers get injured too. 
P: 
Many times. I’ve come home from work before 100 times, mentally drained and physically exhausted 
because I don’t realize when I’m there what I’m doing to myself, and I think that’s why personal care workers 
get injured on the job or they get depressed or they have problems with dealing with the job because they don’t 
realize it when they’re there. They’re too busy trying to focus on that client, and they don’t realize they picked 
up something too heavy, or they did something they shouldn’t have done. Not intentionally. I’m not saying that 
they did anything bad or maybe they didn’t realize they hurt the client. And all of a sudden, you know, the next 
day somebody says, “Well, there’s a bruise on that guy.” You know, it’s really hard to take that when you’re a 
caregiver. That is one of the hardest things to take. I had a guy that was—he had down syndrome, he had 
sexually assaulted children. I had to take care of him at night, and I got accused of hitting him in the mouth, 
which I didn’t do. I was taken off the job. They said the police may be calling me for assault. I said I never 
touched the guy [16.46], and the next day they called me back and they said, “Well, that wasn’t a bruise that 
was on his mouth. He’d eaten a purple popsicle. Sorry.” I was livid. I was extremely angry. I was so mad that I 
was accused of doing that and how they didn’t trust me to take care of a client, how I would have hit a person 
like that in the mouth—I went into the office and I said, look, I’m really mad. I said this is wrong. I said you owe 
me more than an apology. You owe me something more than that. I’m not saying I want financial 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Richard Dusenbury. 5.22.18 
 
6
compensation, but I said I want anything on this record expunged from that record, and I also want myself 
vindicated. I did not do that, and that I was accused of hitting a person that I didn’t do, and you did it. I want 
that in my record, and they put it in there because I demanded it. But I also think that, you know, I can be 
pretty—I’m a nice guy, but when I’m accused of something that I didn’t do, I get pretty upset. And I think a lotta 
caregivers are being accused of things that they didn’t do. That’s the hardest thing for me to take is to be 
accused of something that is that preposterous to me, and then saying, “Sorry.” That’s not enough! You know, 
you ruined my life for a couple days. You made me think, what did I do? What am I gonna do now? You know, 
I got the cops gonna be callin’ me on the phone because I hit this guy in the mouth which I didn’t even do? No! 
I was very angry, and I think about it now and I’m angry [laughs], but that’s the kinda things that happen out 
there to caregivers. And I’m not saying that some of ‘em don’t neglect a client, but the majority of ‘em are there 
because they must like it somehow in some way. I’m not sure how they do, and I’m sure that some of ‘em do it 
for the money because they’re poor. They don’t have a lot of money, and I find that a lot of the people that 
work at night—a lot of ‘em are single parents, and they don’t really sleep on the job, but if the client’s gone to 
sleep, and they’re sitting on the couch, it’s easy to drift off, and they probably have to go back out and take 
care of their children the rest of the day [14.12]. And to me, my hat’s off to those people because they have 
taken on a job that can be extremely stressful, very difficult, they don’t have time during the day to do it. They 
have to raise their families themselves, and they are the ones that I feel the sorriest for. And if they run into a 
situation like I did, what are they gonna do? They’re exhausted. They’re tired before they even go to work, and 
they have to do that. They have to be on their toes, and they have to watch that person, and make sure that 
that person’s being taken care because their job depends upon it. They’re career depends upon it, and once 
you’ve got a black mark on your record, it’s hard to find a job. It’s easy to get in trouble, and people do. 
I: 
How about working with clients that you feel close to and then they pass away? 
P: 
I’ve seen death. I have walked in on quite a few people that passed away when I was the only one that 
was taking care of them, and it was 2 or 3 days after they passed away. And I came in and saw it. It’s not easy 
to see, but— 
I: 
So, somebody died, and they were there for 2, 3 days before— 
P: 
Anybody had come— 
I: 
--anybody had come in? 
P: 
Nobody had called them. Nobody knew anything about them, and— 
I: 
And you came in and found them like 3 days later? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. Kinda comical, but disturbing. Of course, you call 911, and they say, “Well, 
have you tried resuscitation?” And you say, no, he’s dead. “Well, we want you to perform CPR until we can get 
there to determine if this person is dead or not.” Well, he’s dead, dead. He’s dead, dead, dead. “Well, you 
should not—” I’m not doing anything. I said I’m telling you right now you get your guys out there right now, and 
you can do that, but I’m not gonna touch a dead body. I’m not gonna perform CPR on a dead body. If I’ve 
checked his pulse and the guy’s ice cold, he’s gone. And I’ve had to do that—and that seems to be a pretty 
consistent thing from 911 is when you call them up they want you to do resuscitation on these people, and you 
know darn well that they’re gone. And you tell ‘em and then they, well—but they’ve got their protocol. I 
understand that, but that’s disturbing [11.45]. It’s depressing to see somebody that you’ve known for a long 
time maybe, passed away. But it happens, and you have to be able to deal with the situation, try to remove 
yourself from the emotional end of it. At that point, you’re no longer caring for this person. You’re only caring 
for what’s left of them, so your job is done. This is the end of your job for this person, and you have to move on 
to another client, and I can understand how that would be really, really hard for some people to deal with. And I 
think that a lot of caregivers quit because their client died. They can’t deal with the fact that they died, and I

think that maybe you feel a little bit guilty that they did. What could I have done, you know, what could I have 
done differently ‘cause you’re always questioning yourself. If you’re in that kind of work, you’re gonna question 
yourself all the time because if you don’t, you’re going to start falling into bad habits and you’re going to 
become complacent and you’re gonna get tired of your job. It’s not gonna be exciting anymore, and you’re just 
gonna basically kinda turn into a vegetable caregiver. There’s a lot of ‘em out there. They’re just tired. They’re 
burned out. Caregiver burnout is very, very common. I’ve had it. I’ve had caregiver burnout where I got just 
totally tired of this person. I said I can’t deal with it anymore, and I have taken clients and said—I’ve gone to 
the agency, I said I can’t take care of this person anymore. There’s just too many things going on with this 
person, and I can’t do it.  
I: 
I would love to ask you for a story. Can you tell me about a—I have so many other things I wanna ask 
you— 
P: 
When I quit? When I quit on a client? For what reasons? 
I: 
You know, when you say that a client—there’s too many things going on with that client, can you 
explain that a little bit? 
P: 
Okay. I had a guy that lived in a high-rise apartment—senior citizen center—that had a liking for young 
women that were women of the evening, I guess you’d call them [9.34]. They had a habit of using drugs. They 
needed a place to stay when they got outta jail, and he had an extra bed in his little place, and he liked women. 
His whole life he liked women like that. I took care of him for probably a year, and I told them I said I don’t want 
them coming up here. I don’t wanna—when I’m here, I said you send them away. I said I’m here to take care of 
you - not those kinda people. If you have them in here, they need to leave. That’s my rules, and that’s also the 
company rules. They will not allow me to be around people like that. So, he said, “Well, just go clean up this 
room.” I said okay. So, I went to start cleaning up the bed, and I almost got stuck by a needle. They left a 
needle right in the bed. And I said, I picked up a glove and I picked up the needle, and I showed it to him like 
that. I said this is not gonna fly. I’m reporting this incident to my supervisor because we have a needle 
involved, and I almost got stuck. I said you’ve got people coming up into this place that have hepatitis or worse. 
I said I’ve never approved of it. I’ve told you that. I’m sorry, but I can’t work for you anymore, and I left. And I 
went back to the office, and I said I’m not taking care of this man anymore. He’s got the wrong kinda people 
hangin’ around there. I said they’re dangerous. I said [pause] that’s it. 
I: 
And the company honored your wishes? 
P: 
They did. They did. 
I: 
So, if a situation like that feels so unsafe, are there other situations like abusive situations that you can 
talk about whether it’s abuse of the client, or family or anything related to that? 
P: 
I usually manage to tough it out with the family ‘cause I’m pretty resourceful when it comes to finding 
my way through those things. I’m not happy about it, but you know, usually—I think what happens is it’s like 
Karma, eventually the things just don’t work out with that person for other people—I find that the other people 
that are going over there are having worse problems than I am, and they eventually—the client will stop—
they’ll stop either giving care to the client or the client will go with a different agency because they’re not getting 
what they want from the agency that I’m working for. So, usually they kinda go away on their own, and it’s kind 
of a waiting game to see [6.57], “Hey, this guy hasn’t much longer anyway.” They’re not happy. They family’s 
not happy. Oh, I won’t be here long. I’ll probably go one or two more times and that’s it. Of course, it’s dragged 
on before, but for the most part I’m pretty good at callin’ that. I mean it’s because I’ve been seeing it so many 
times, and I know the scenarios how they play out. And it’s kinda like playing cards, so I know what’s gonna 
happen next. I’ll play this. No, I won’t. I’ll hold that, so it’s a mind game most of the time. Most of the stress that 
I have on the job is a mind game.

I: 
So, when we took a little break you mentioned that you wanted to tell a story about financial abuse. 
P: 
Yes. The guy that we took care of her 20 some years had a mother, and she is the one that was the 
payee. She wanted to receive the money from social security, and we received money from social security for 
him, and she received all the mail, and as time went by his social security went up, and she never told us that 
his social security went up. So, she pocketed that money that really should have gone to us and to him. She 
stopped giving him any pocket money to speak of. I think she gave him $10 or $20 a month, and she was 
keeping $200 or $300 a month, and then her visits to him became less and less frequent. She used to take him 
out to lunch once in a while, so we didn’t say anything about it. But it was his own mother that was abusing that 
small amount of money, and I thought how petty, how, you know, how could you do that? You know, we’ve 
been taking care of your son for 20 years, and you’re gonna do that? You’re gonna pocket that money and 
didn’t tell us. Okay. That’s abuse. That’s abuse of both the client and the caregiver. That money was our 
money, and she took it. 
I: 
Do you find, you know, it’s rather rare to see a male personal care worker. There aren’t that many of 
you. 
P: 
No, there are not. 
I: 
Can you talk about that for a minute? Do you think that you bring something different to it or experience 
it in a different way just by virtue of the fact that you’re a man? 
P: 
Yeah. It’s good and bad. It’s good because you can always find lots of work. There’s always people that 
need male caregivers. It’s a very high-demand—people are always asking me for male caregivers. They’re 
happy to get ‘em, and a lotta times I’ve been put into situations where they had a female caregiver taking care 
of a male, and he was saying inappropriate things, doing inappropriate things, touching women inappropriately, 
and that’s when the male caregiver comes in [3.50]. And sometimes when you get a male that’s been doing 
that for a long time and thinking that this is a great life I have, well, you know what, all that’s over now. You 
don’t have that anymore, and they can become kind of resentful of the fact that they have a male caregiver. “I’d 
rather have a woman give me a bath than you! I don’t like this.” Well, that’s the male psyche right there, and I 
know that, and I accept that, and if they don’t like it sometimes I’ll speak up and I’ll say, well, you know why I’m 
here. “No. I don’t.” And I say, yeah, you do. You know why I’m here. I’m here to make sure that everything is 
going smoothly, and that we don’t have any problems. I try to put it in as vague a terms as I possibly can, but 
so that they can get the message that I’m there because you’ve been touching women. You’ve been doing 
things to the female staff that you shouldn’t be doing, and I am the only one that you can get because you’ve 
already abused lots of people. So, you get abuse from, you know, caregivers—especially female caregivers 
taking care of men, they get a lot of abuse—verbal or just these little inuendoes that they have to deal with. I 
don’t have to deal with that. They don’t dare do that to me. How could they? Do you think that a person like me 
is gonna tolerate any kind of an inuendo? I’ve taken care of many people, but— 
I: 
Do you find the reverse is true, though, that there are women who would be uncomfortable having a 
male take care of them? 
P: 
I will not take care of a woman. 
I: 
Really? 
P: 
I will not do it. I don’t wanna put myself at risk or in jeopardy for any kind of sexual abuse or anything 
like that. I will not work for a woman unless it’s where I don’t have to do anything, and it’s in a situation where 
there’s other people in the place. If it was a one-on-one with a woman, I will not do it. ‘Cause I can’t. 
Professionally, it would be career changing, career ending. Very quickly. I could be in a situation where I’m 
being accused of that by the family member, so I don’t do it. I just say no. I will not do that. A woman doesn’t

necessarily have that choice. That’s what’s so hard, and don’t think that I’m defending women in the trade, but 
I honestly think that they have it harder than I do [1.22]. I’m a rare commodity. I’m like a—I don’t have to do 
much, and I can be the superstar, but it’s all—it’s a very difficult question to answer. I really don’t know how to 
answer it perfectly, but I do know that I have it pretty easy being a male caregiver. 
I: 
And you said male caregivers are in big demand, can you tell me why? Explain why? 
P: 
I think it’s they don’t—a lotta men don’t wanna take care of people. They would rather do a job and not 
have to deal with people on cerebral level. They’re—I’m not trying to say men are all alike. We’re not, but I 
think a lotta men don’t like the pay. They think, “I can make a lot more money than that.” But I do find that 
Arcadia does have a lot of male caregivers, and it’s nice because I can see oh, he’s here. Oh, she’s here, so 
it’s—I would have to say when I change shifts, it’s about 50-50, but I’m taking care of mostly men. 
I: 
Yeah. We’re gonna stop here just for a minute. 
P: 
All right. 
I: 
Is that good? Okay. Great stories. You’ve experienced a lot, you’ve seen a lot [end Tape 2].  
P: 
It’s right behind me. 
I: 
There you go. It doesn’t say Arcadia though. 
P: 
No. 
I: 
But it does over there, so. 
P: 
Yeah. That’s fine. 
I2: 
I am ready. 
I: 
Okay. All right. We’re going to start again, and I’m going to shift into a little bit different subject matter 
talking about the bigger picture of personal care workers in the United States. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And I’m going to start with—you mentioned, you just mentioned a lot of amazing scenarios that you 
have walked in on or had to deal with, and you did mention a little bit about training for how to deal with some 
of it, but could you talk about the kind of training you received, that personal care workers received to prepare 
for this job? 
P: 
Well, I’m a CNA. I’m not an active CNA right now, but I was in Washington, and I decided that I didn’t 
really need to do that [25.24] here. So, I’ve had some pretty extensive training. I’m also a certified medical 
assistant, so I’ve gone through a lot of training for how to work in a clinic, how to work in an ER. I’ve worked in 
clinics. I worked in an ER for a little while. Found out that physically I was unable to do it. I have disability. My 
knees both have arthritis in ‘em really bad. I had one knee replaced. I guess I’ll go through the litany of what’s 
wrong with me physically so that you can get an idea of what my limitations are, but also how my training came 
in with all of this. Having worked over the years in keeping a CNA license and being a caregiver, you’re 
required to do CEUs—continuing education units—and those are very helpful. When I worked in Washington 
they’re very big on training. I was impressed because I knew over the years it did—they increased the amount 
of CEUs that were necessary for you to have in order to keep your CNA license or your nursing-assistant 
license, and all of the agencies that are involved are required to provide that to their employees. So, I come 
from a culture where I think the state of Washington is more strict on how much education a person gets, and 
they put the responsibility on the agencies. I like that because they’re forced to deal with it. They’re forced to 
actually see those employees coming in there, and the employees actually get to see each other and kind of

bounce some things off each other for a couple days [23.27] a year, and it’s fun. I always had a lotta fun at 
those because of the fact that—well, some of the instructors were just as boring as could be. They had no 
business being an instructor, but I had some very good instructors, and I learned a lot of very interesting 
things. And having question and answers in those kind of classes is good because the caregivers are actually 
the ones that come up with the best ideas because they’re the ones that are actually out there, and if you have 
a good trainer they are a good listener, and they will listen to these things. But you can’t let the students take 
over the class. You have to actually teach something, so the trainings that I had were very good. I’ve been 
through, oh—I think one of the most interesting classes that I went through was the self-defense class to deal 
with people who could be violent. That was extremely interesting to me because it—and the trainer was so 
good, and this is probably 15 years ago I took the class, and I still remember because it made such an 
impression on me because the guy was so realistic about it. He told you how to act. He told you what to do, 
and from there on I was much  more confident in what I was doing, not only for being—defending myself, but 
how to handle myself with other clients because you’re gonna always get some kind of an escalation in any 
situation. And that training was so good that I feel very confident that I can take care of myself in just about any 
situation [21.42]. It was good. 
I: 
It sounds like you believe training to be valuable. 
P: 
Extremely valuable. A lot of people don’t think so but having been through so many trainings—a 100 
or—I’ve done ‘em online, I’ve done ‘em all different ways. I like the live training. I guess you call it live fire. I like 
that. I would rather have a training like that any day where you’re meeting somebody and you’re meeting other 
people in person, so that you can actually see how they act, get the interactions between the students and the 
teacher itself. 
I: 
So, speak about training related to dementia? Working with— 
P: 
Dementia? I’ve done a class not too long ago, I think it was last year in Washington. Yeah. Two years 
ago, and the class described all the different kinds of dementia that it possibly could in a class. And they 
squeezed it into 4 hours. It’s a huge subject, and I was amazed that I learned so much in that class and stuff 
that I didn’t know that I thought I might have known. No, no, no, no, no. This guy taught me a lot more than 
what I knew, and I walked out of there saying this guy’s [a client] got this kinda dementia. And I would think 
about it, and I would go to see the clients, and he’s doin’ that. That’s blah, blah, blah, and I would go get the 
paper out ‘cause I don’t remember all the kinds of dementia there are. There’s so many. I’m not that 
knowledgeable, but at least I had a paper that I could go back to and say, that’s what this guy’s got. Wow. I 
was shocked, but those are the kinda classes that I think are invaluable [19.50], and to teach dementia I would 
recommend that curriculum to anybody that is taking care of dementia clients because it was so interesting to 
find out that there are so many different kinds of dementia, and how they present themselves. How do they 
progress? What do they do next or why does this happen? 
I: 
And you talk a lot about the mind games. You know, a lot of it’s just figuring out what’s going on with 
the family member or the client, and then finding the best response. And I’m guessing that you would respond 
very differently to a person with dementia than you would with a person who doesn’t have dementia or the 
different kinds of dementia or—I mean that knowledge is helpful. 
P: 
Oh, it’s so—I learned so much in that class, and that’s just one example. I mean I’ve taken classes in 
dementia before where they touch on this, and they talk about the behaviors and everything, but this class 
actually went into the medical reasons, the physical reasons, the physical things that can happen to somebody 
who’s got dementia. And when I found out that information it was like a light bulb went off in my head. Nobody 
had actually ever put all these different kinds of dementias and explained them and had all the list of all the 
symptoms in one page or in one little booklet and had somebody explain it. It was like, wow! This is great! All 
these years I’ve been just kind of fiddling around and not quite understanding, but those are the kinds of things 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Richard Dusenbury. 5.22.18

that make a caregiver a better caregiver with classes like that. There’s a lotta classes that I’ve been through 
that taught me absolutely nothing. 
I: 
Now, for the personal care workers that aren’t affiliated with an agency, there are no training 
requirements. 
P: 
There should be [17.53]. It should be required— 
I: 
Why is that— 
P: 
--if you’re caring for somebody and they’re a state-pay client, they’re on social security, you’re gettin’ 
their social security check or they’re caregiver hours or whatever they get, and the state pays those, they 
should be required, bar none, 12 hours minimum per year. That’s my—I mean that’s a number I would put out 
there. It should be 20, but and paid. Of course, paid. They should not have to pay for that out of their pocket. 
There should be some kind of a way for them to have their client be covered while they’re at this class. 
I: 
What would you say about personal care workers that are out there doing this kind of work with no 
training? 
P: 
[Pause] maybe they’re good. I don’t know. Maybe they’re not. Who knows. Who knows what they really 
are. You’re takin’ a big chance. When we had my grandmother, we had to take a chance because at that time 
there really weren’t very many agencies around that did this kinda thing. You had to pay for it out of pocket, 
and we got people in there that were good, and some that were duds.  They didn’t do a thing. They just sat 
there in a chair and, well, there were no smart phones then that they could play with all day long, but they 
would sit and read a book or. 
I: 
You mentioned earlier that you aren’t allowed to work over a certain number of hours, can you explain 
what you mean by that? 
P: 
I’m not allowed to make a certain amount of money. I’m on disability, so with disability I get disability, 
and I’m allowed to make $1170 a month. If I go over that, I lose my disability. So, I love to work. I’m disabled. I 
really can’t work full-time because of my physical problems, but I also wanna contribute to society and help 
people that are less fortunate than me. I had a stroke in February. Luckily, it wasn’t too bad. It could have been 
really bad. I came out of it okay. I was back to work in a month—little more than a month, and Arcadia was 
very accommodating to me, and they wanted to make sure I was fine, and I had to go get the doctor’s excuse, 
of course, and they started me back a little bit. And I got back to where I was before. I’m actually working even 
harder than I was before and enjoying it even more because of the fact that I did have another event in my life 
that was a milestone—a stroke is a milestone, and I’m very lucky that I came out of it well [14.57], but I did 
suffer some physical things that happened to me that made me understand my clients that much more. 
[Laughs] and being lucky to be alive is quite a thing to have behind you. 
I: 
So, as an agency employee, do you get paid per client visit or—I mean you don’t get a straight salary— 
P: 
No. 
I: 
Guaranteed salary. 
P: 
No. It’s always by the hour. 
I: 
So, if you don’t work—you took a month—if you don’t have clients, you don’t have an income? 
P: 
Right. It was a very difficult month for me. 
I: 
How do you make ends meet? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Richard Dusenbury. 5.22.18

P: 
Um [pause] I’m paying for it right now. You can’t. If you lose that much money out of your life, and 
you’re in a nursing home for 3 weeks, and you have social security/disability and you have Medicare as your 
insurance, ‘cause that’s all you can really afford, you’re gonna get some hallatious bills, and I have bills, and 
it’s very difficult for me to pay them off. I’m working right now with the hospital to try to make it a little bit easier 
on me, but I haven’t had any success yet. So, it’s been very difficult for me financially [13.34]. I have a lot of 
other things going on in my life, too, but that’s hard. It’s very, very hard, but I’m fortunate enough to be able to 
work again and with time I’ll be okay, but it’s gonna take time. And it’s a lotta stress, personally, to do that, but 
like I say, I enjoy doing caregiving, and to me it’s a stress reliever in many ways. It causes stress, but it’s a 
stress reliever because I’m doing something. I’m occupying my time. I’m doing something for somebody else. 
I’m going to a different place. 
I: 
Talk about, if you could for a minute, about, you know, there’s the work hours, the work for client, per 
client, but the wage, the benefits, just the job conditions associated with being a personal care worker? What 
are your feelings on that? 
P: 
Well, in Washington, I was a unionized caregiver. Member of the SEIU 775. I didn’t really get to partake 
of the benefits of that. I don’t think it really gave me much more money per hour by having that done. It made 
the company that I worked for less accommodating to me. They were more trying to accommodate the union, 
not that I’m anti-union, because I think that the union did a lot of things for people that they can’t do on their 
own, but for me personally, I’m fine working here, for the company that I do, because I don’t have to deal with 
the union. I don’t have to pay union dues. There’s not $50 comin’ outta my check every month for union dues 
for something—and to be honest, they never did anything for me. I just paid my dues. Here, if I have a problem 
I take it directly to the people that I’m working for. There’s no complications in it. It works for me. I don’t know if 
it works for everybody, but it does work for me, and I’m happier working for this company than my previous 
company. I will tell you that. Flat out I will tell you that this company is far better to work for than who I worked 
for before, but that was because it was complicated by a union. There was always that in between thing. Now, 
if you had a grievance and you wanted to file it, blah, blah, blah, blah blah, they really didn’t support you that 
much. I never had to use ‘em, but I mean from talking to other caregivers, they didn’t really—they didn’t really 
help [10.57] the caregivers that much when they got into problems with their job. 
I: 
So, what do you say when people ask you what do you do for a living? Are you up front with them and 
say exactly what you do? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And you’re okay with that? 
P: 
Yeah. I’m not embarrassed of it. I mean I think it’s a wonderful job, and if people ask questions about 
what I do, I’m very open about what I do. I can’t say certain things of course because of confidentiality, but I 
can let them know, yeah, I do that. I do that. I do that, too, and I can tell them a few stories on what’s happened 
to me as long as I don’t attach a name to it or a place or a time, then I can tell them some of these stories and 
they laugh. They find me very, very interesting to talk to because of the fact that it’s such a foreign thing to 
them. They don’t understand the concept of what a caregiver really does, and it’s amazing to me. I thought, 
you know what a caregiver does. People don’t know. They really don’t know what a caregiver’s up against 
every single day, and the stresses that they have to go through, the weird hours, the low pay, all of that stuff. 
They don’t quite understand it. 
I: 
So, in addition to the stress, the low pay, the lack of benefits and guaranteed hours, people often say 
there’s also a lack of respect, and you alluded to that at the very beginning. That there’s just not a lot of value 
placed on personal care workers in the United States.

P: 
Oh, I agree. I think they’re vastly misunderstood, and there’s a stigma, I guess is the word I would use, 
against them because of the fact that they’re not—they’re considered to be a low-skilled person [8.58] of a 
lower social standing of—they’re not capable of becoming a nurse. They did something—they just don’t have 
enough skills to do a good job, and they’re in a low-paying job because they don’t have skills. And that’s 
disrespect. To me that’s a total disrespect of the business or of the trade, I guess you would call it, and I think it 
really, really hurts a lotta people when there’s stigma—their stigma is that they’re just doing the job that nobody 
else wants to do. You’re at the bottom of the ladder, and I wouldn’t allow myself to be at the bottom of the 
ladder and spoken to like that. It doesn’t bother me. If somebody wants to say something like that to me, I will 
correct them. I will say, you know what, it’s not an easy job. I dare you to go out and do it. I dare you to go 
spend a night with a person with dementia, and then they wake up in the middle of the night, and what do you 
do? It’s pressure. Do you think you could handle that? And a lotta people will say, “I had no idea.” They don’t 
know. They don’t have a concept of what a caregiver goes through in a day, and there’s a lot of unsung heroes 
out there. And I’m not just talking about caregivers that get paid to do it. There’s a lotta family members that 
have had to go through that, and I find a lot of people saying to me, “Yeah. I took care of my mom when she 
was like that. Boy, that was hard. You’re doin’ it for that much money? Wow, that’s not enough.” So, I think that 
caregivers are unpaid because they can be taken advantage of. They’re not of a high social standing. They 
don’t have credentials that can cause them to become a member of a club that gets paid more. They’re not an 
LPN. They don’t have a license, so to get them licensed would be nice, but I’m not sure that it really needs to 
be done. I just think they need to be paid more. I think that more needs to be done to ensure that [6.38] people 
that are doing this job are at a living wage. This is not workin’ at McDonalds. This is a lot more responsibility on 
a person than working at McDonalds, and you get paid basically the same amount as that person that’s flippin’ 
burgers. Not that flippin’ burgers is easy, but you have to have so much more knowledge, so much more 
responsibility, so much more physical and mental abuse that you have to go through every single day, you 
can’t even compare those to, and they’re underpaid. I know that for a fact that they’re underpaid. 
I: 
So, you clearly don’t feel this is a low-skilled job? 
P: 
I don’t. I think it takes a lotta skill. I think that a lotta people are brought into it because there’s 
[laughs]—there’s just not enough caregivers. You can step into the caregiver business and find a job right 
away because there’s just so much demand for ‘em, but my question is this. If there’s so much demand for 
these jobs, then why isn’t the pay higher? What is keeping the pay so low? 
I: 
What do you think the answer is? 
P: 
Because I think caregivers don’t have much of a voice in what they can make. There’s no standards. 
There’s no minimum wage for a caregiver. You can get paid minimum wage and be a caregiver without any 
benefits whatsoever. You can work—they can make you work 10 hours a week. They’ll never have to pay you 
any kind of benefits. They can do that. 
I: 
So, pretend for a second that I’m the Governor. 
P: 
You’re the Governor, oh, God, help me. Well, I would say— 
I: 
What would you tell me? What would you say? What would you say to the world to educate people, to 
raise awareness about the work that you do, what you do, the value of your work, and what changes you think 
need to be made? What would you say to the world? 
P: 
I’d say to the world, we are taking care of your nearest and dearest. We’re there 24-7 in a lotta cases. 
On that job so you don’t have to be there. You can come in at your leisure and see your parents or your sibling 
or whoever you’re taking care of, even children, we’re there for you. And we need to be recognized for the fact 
that we are there when other people are not. We are doing a job that a lot of other people will not do. And we 
need to get compensated for that in a way that’s more in line with the rest of the world [3.61]. Our training may

not be in the class room all the time. We may not have a degree, but we come from the school of hard knocks. 
It’s not easy being a caregiver. It is not an easy job, and if you think it’s gonna be an easy job when you walk in 
there, you’re gonna be disappointed really fast, and you’re gonna find out that it’s not that easy, and your pay’s 
not gonna be very high, and you’re gonna either have to accept it or find something else to do. And a lot of ‘em 
do. I find a lot of people are trying to get a better job, and that just opens up another void. I mean people are 
upwardly mobile. They’re moving out of this position because they like what they do, but they wanna get more 
money. It’s not a living wage. They can’t afford to live on this wage, and if you were the Governor, I would ask 
for more money, please. Give it more—give caregivers more money because of the fact that it’s a 
misunderstood occupation, and it needs to be more understood by the government. They need to be paid more 
for what they do [2.42]. It’s as simple as that. 
I: 
Well done. Thank you so much, R. 
P: 
Thank you. 
I: 
Thank you for the work that you do, and also for this interview.  
P: 
Well, thank you for having me, and it’s been fun, and I hope that was able to convey my feelings on it, 
and maybe even represent some of the feelings of the other people that are not able to be here. And I kinda 
thought about that when I was coming to this interview. I thought, well, I’m not just representing myself, I’m 
representing my occupation and a lot of other people are counting on me to convey what they are thinking. So, 
it’s not about me. 
I: 
You’re a good spokesperson. 
P: 
Thank you. 
I: 
I hope you might be willing to do more of it at some point. 
P: 
I would love to. 
I: 
Okay. One of the things we’re gonna do—we hope to do, is have, as I mentioned an exhibition and it 
would be wonderful to supplement it with you know, speakers from the field. So, there will be other 
opportunities for you to be the voice. 
P: 
[Laughing] oh, no. 
I; 
And I hope— 
P: 
I don’t know about that. I would do it. I just—I don’t know. I can shoot from the hip from right here, but 
when you put me in front of a bunch a people, I get stage fright. I have. I have that a little bit, but I can do it. As 
long as I have some notes in front of me I can do it. 
I: 
Sure. 
P: 
But for me to just stand up and talk and take questions, eh, no. 
I: 
Well, we need a voice. We need a collective voice is what we need, so that’s partly what we’re trying to 
achieve. K, do you have anything you want to add before we— 
I2: 
No. Thank you especially for the stories ‘cause it helps people relate and helps people put themselves 
into a scenario and see how they would act or whatever. So, those are really helpful.  
P: 
Okay. Yeah. What would you do? I love to ask that question to people that don’t know what I do, and 
they ask me and then I’ll give ‘em a story, and they go, “Like, oh, my, God.” What would you do if somebody

was actually biting you? Had a lock on your arm, you know, what would you do? “I’d probably beat ‘em.” I said, 
well, then you’d probably get arrested for assault. What do you do? 
I: 
That’s right. 
P: 
Run to the hills. 
I: 
[Laughs] I loved your response—I got him off of me and then I ran [laughs]. 
P: 
Away!  
I: 
[Laughing] away! 
P; 
[Laughing] and he chased me, and the problem— 
I: 
You were too fast. 
P: 
Yeah. He couldn’t catch me. He was too much of a klutz. 
I: 
That’s what I would of done. Okay. I’m gonna turn this off, and move aside so that—
