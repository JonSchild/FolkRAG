Norma Ellis: My name is Norma Ellis, Crane, Missouri. I know that this is a time that's a very grave
situation. It was true when Woodrow Wilson was president, Abraham Lincoln, and it is true with you.
But I think it is time now that we eliminate some of the things that we have spent so much money
especially eliminate all WPA and the CC camps and put that money to national defense. And I think
that you should have been spending some of this money for a national dispense. I believe as Teddy
Roosevelt stressed, preparedness. And when you are prepared then you will be ready to fight. We
remember now Pearl Harbor. If that had been fortified and if those men had really not been asleep
on the job â€” of course, that's not your fault - the situation would have not been like it was.
I would like for you to stress the national defense more and more. Make the people of America feel
that they should every spare dollar buy the savings bonds. And all of the women of America should
unite and get to work for the Red Cross. I thank you.

Ben Carney: My name is Ben Carney, Crane, Missouri. My dear Mr. President, I've been told that in
four minutes I can say and ask as many questions as I want to. I assure you that it will not take four
minutes to express exactly how I feel and to ask all the questions I need.
A few years ago I could have thought a lot of things that I wanted to ask. Could've given a lot of
good advice. But as this year, and last year has gone by, I have found that my advice would have
been absolutely no good. The questions that I would have asked have been answered. Now I frankly
admit that I don't know. I can only say to you that I have explicit trust in your judgement and in the
judgement of those men whom you have around you. I know from experience that you have chosen
the best men available in these United States. And I know, as does everyone else in this country
know, that those men are of the highest intelligence and will do their upmost in this grave crisis
confronting us today.
I frankly admit that I do not know what is going to happen. I can only say, I can only repeat what I
have said before, that my trust is in you, in your cohorts. Anything that you do I assure you that I am
behind you one hundred percent. As postmaster of this town I'm doing little bit, very little I assure
you, but as much as I can, forcing the sales of defense bonds and stamps. Selling the used tax on
automobiles, buying what few stamps I can, buying them for my automobile, and urging everyone to

do their upmost. I only hope that in the years to come that the people of the United States can look
back upon these past years and know that we have done right. Thank you.
