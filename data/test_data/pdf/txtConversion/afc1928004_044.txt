The Good Looking Girl. 
My friend Arabella, at Harlem was a 
dweller, 
Describe her to you now I 
think that I 
will, 
She had ringlets in plenty, her age was just twenty, 
And a 
pair of dark eyes that went through you 
pell mell; 
Her teeth were the whitest, her 
stop was the 
lightest, 
To her flounces she gave a 
peculiar whirl, 
All thought her 
delightful, except 
old maids 
spiteful, 
In fact, she was a 
nice-looking girl. 
In a 
shop that was handy, she sold sugar-candy, 
Tarts, pies, cherry-brandy, and sweet kisses too ; 
Besides lemon ices, which in summer so nice is, 
Ginger beer, lemorade, and confections a 
few ; 
The Blasted Fleatrh; Or, The Castle of the Wlod. 
The very scenery seems terror smitten by bloody acts.

iCow Bell had a 
lover, a 
true one moreover, 
Tho' oft like a 
rover he wandered afar, 
His trade you will bless it, that is if you guess it, ' 
But I 
may as well tell you he was a 
Jack tar. 
He had asked Bell to tarry till her faithful Harry, 
The cruise being ended his sails up could furl, 
When with shot in the locker, as tars didn't shock 
her, 
He'd fetch up alongsidelhis nice-looking girl. 
Bell 
loved him full 
dearly, and wished most 
sincerely 
Her true-hearted sailor might quickly return, 
s' 
But as they've done her sisters, these moustachio 
twisters, 
Soon brought her to grief, as you shortly shall 
learn ; 
One morning while flirting, their feelings quite 
hurting, 
Pretending to box an unmannerly churl 
Who passed every day there, a 
voice cried " Belay 
there, 
You swab, take your paws off my nice-looking 
•.

All turned 
in amazement, when crash thro' the 
casement 
Upsetting the jellies, the custards and ice,

baby Hal 
shook him, 
Such an object he looked with his hair out of 
curl, 
Then into the gutter, he pitched him to splutter, 
To the mental chagrin of this nice-looking girl. 
To complete the disaster, down stairs came the 
master, 
Aroused by the noise, and he started with 
affright 
On his glasses, once polished, now lying demolished 
And bawled out " Police !" as, indeed, well he 
might, 
Poor Bell commenced screaming, while Hal with 
smiles beaming, 
Cried, " Hark ye, my hearty, don't frighten that 
pearl,

claim her, the beauty, and of course, done my

I'd Be a 
Butterfly. 
I'd be a 
butterfly born in a 
bow'r, 
Where roses and lilies and violets meet; 
Roving for ever from flower to flower, 
And kissing all buds that are pretty and meet. 
I'd never languish for wealth or for power, 
I'd never sigh to see slaves at my feet, 
I'd be a 
butterfly born in a 
bow'r, 
And kissing all buds that are pretty and sweet. 
I'd be a 
butterfly, &c. 
Oh, could I 
pilfer the wand of a 
fairy, 
have a 
pair of those beautiful wings ; 
Their summer day's ramble is sportive and airy, 
They sleep in a 
rose when the nightingale sings; 
Those who have wea:th must be watchful and wary, 
„Power, alas! nought but misery brings; 
I'd be a 
butterfly, sportive and airy, 
Rock'd in a 
rose when the nightingale sings. 
I'd be a 
butterfly, &c. 
What tho' you tell me each gay little rover 
Shrinks from the breath of the first autumn day 
Surely ' tis better, when summer is over, 
To die, when all fair things are fading away. 
Some in life's winter may toil to discover 
Means of procuring a 
weary delay ;— 
I'd be a

Dying when fair things are fading away.

A 
charming creature I 
espied 
So delicate and rare, 
A low-necked dress the darling wore, 
And a 
wealth of golden hair, hair, hair. 
CHORUS. 
I 
vow'd to follow her everywhere, 
Oh ! every everywhere. 
The cherry red lips and eyes of blue, 
Had this Girl wiih the Golden hair. 
I 
asked if I 
might see her home, 
Which she allowed me to do, 
Oh! wasn't I 
nuts on that Golden hair, 
And the Girl that wore it too, 
Arrived at home she told me that 
Her husband's name was Brown, 
I 
ask'd her where he was, she said, 
" 
Why he's only out of town, town, town. 
I 
vowed, &c. 
In a 
drawing-room floor She lived at ease 
At the very best house in the row, 
'Twas number Thirty-two in a 
street, 
The name of which I 
don't know. 
She said she had no wealth in lands, 
Nor jewels rich or rare, 
Did I 
asked her what she wanted of them, 
When she'd so much gold in her hair, hair, hair. 
I 
vowed, &c. 
As the night advanced the stars peep'd out, 
She grew so wonderous kind 
That I 
placed my arm around her waist, 
Which she did not seem to mind. 
But letting her head fall gently down, 
On my shoulder it rested there, 
But this angel in blue with the delicate hue, 
And her wealth of golden hair, hair, hair.

""fis growing late," I 
hurriedly said, 
" 
And I 
must wish you good bye." 
But she answered " it's cruel to leave me thus, 
You need not be so shy," 
Then nervously picking up my hat, 
The stairs I 
was hurrying down, 
When at the foot upon the mat, 
There stood her husband, Brown, Brown, Brown. 
I 
vowed, &c. 
I 
soon found out how foolish I'd been, 
To fall in such a 
snare, 
Before a 
Court then I 
was brought, 
My innocence to declare. 
The judge put on his sternest frown, 
And with a 
horrid glare, 
Said he, " Young Sir, you've 500 to pay 
For your love of Golden Hair, Hair, Hair. 
I 
vowed to follow her everywhere, 
Oh, every everywhere, 
But the link I 
find is too dear to bind 
My love for Golden Hair. 
Where There's a 
Will There's a Way. 
.This life is a 
difficult riddle, 
For how many people we see, 
With faces as long as a 
fiddle, 
That ought to look shining with glee. 
I 
am sure in this world there are plenty, 
Of good things enough for us all, 
And yet there's not one out of twenty • 
But thinks that his share is too small. 
CHORUS. 
Then what is the use of repining. 
For where there's a 
will there's a 
way, 
And to-morrow the sun may be shining, 
Although it is cloudy to-day.

Did you ever hear tell of the spider, 
That tried up the wall bard to climb, 
If not just take that as a 
guider, 
You'll find it will serve you in time. 
sine times it tried hard to be mounting, 
And every time it stuck fast, 
But it tried hard again without counting, 
And of course it succeeded at last., 
Some grumble because they're not married 
And cannot procure a 
good wife, 
Whilst others they wish they had tarried, 
And long for a 
bachelor's life, 
To me it is very bowild'rin, 
Some grumble, it must be in fun, 
Because they have too many children, 
And others because they have none. 
•Do you think that by sitting and sighing 
You'd ever obtain all you want, 
It's cowards alone that are crying, 
And foolishly saying, " I 
can't." 
It's only by plodding and striving, 
And laboring up the steep hill 
Of life, that you'll ever be thriving, 
Which you'll do if you've only the- will. 
Long, Long Ago.

Long, long ago, long, long ago;

Do you remember the path where we met, 
Long, long ago, long ago. 
Ah, yes! you told me you ne'et would forget, 
Long, long ago, long ago. 
Then to all others my smile you preferr'd, 
Love, when you spoke, gave a 
charm to each 
word; 
Still my heart treasures the praises I 
heard, 
Long, long ago, long ago. 
Though by your kindness my fond hopes were 
rais'd, 
Long, long ago, long, ago; 
.You by more eloquent lips have been prais'd, 
Long, long ago, long ago. 
But by long absence your truth has been tried, 
Still by your accents I 
listen with pride ; 
Blest as I 
was when I 
sat by your side, 
Long, long ago, long ago. 
Love launched a 
fairy boat 
On a 
bright and shining river, 
j 
And said" My bark shall float 
O'er the sunny waves for ever, 
The gentlest gales shall fill the sails 
(: 
That bear me onward cheerily, 
And through time's glass the sand shall pass 
From morn till ev'ning merrily." 
But soon the heavens grew dark, 
And wildly rushed the current, 
Love felt his fragile bark 
Must.founder in the torrent ; 
The tempests' gale rent ev'ry sail, 
Love mourned his folly drearily, 
But Prudence found the boy aground, 
And steered him homeward merrily.

I've watched with thee the daylight stealing 
O'er the gloomy shades of night,

For such the spell when thou art near me,

love like mine, 
The flower that holds the heart in thrall, 
Oh ! rather I'd win that charm divine, 
Than their gold, and their pearl, and all. 
I've sought it by day, from morn till eve, 
I've won it in dreams at night, 
And then how I 
grieve my couch to leave, 
And sigh at the morning light. 
Yet, sometimes I 
think, in a 
hopeful hour, 
The blissful moment I 
yet may see, 
Or, win the flower from the fairy's bower, 
And give it, love, to thee! 
Long Time Ago. 
Near the lake 'where droop'd the willow, long time 
ago I 
Where the rock threw back the billow brighter 
than the snow ; 
Dwelt a 
maid, belov'd and cherish'd by high and 
low; 
But with autumn's leaf she perish'd, long time I 
ago 
Rock, and tree, and flowing water, long time ago I 
Bird, and bee, and blossoms taught her love's 
spell to know ; 
While to my fond words she listen'd, murmuring 
low, 
Tenderly her dove-eyes glisten'd, long time.ago! 
Mingled were our hearts for ever, long time ago! 
Can I 
now forget her ? never, no, lost one, no 
To her grave these tears are given, 
Ever to flow! 
She's the star I 
miss'd from heaven, long time ago!

About the Races I 
will sin(); 
And all thi ngs i
n 
my song I'll bring, 
For once a 
year I 
always go, 
Because it is the place you know, 
Where people go to spend -the day, 
And on the course their money lay, 
Dress themselves in something white, 
To get there early they go in the night. 
Some hire a 
trap, some go by train, 
Some in peddlers' carts shouting might and 
main 
" 
Come up, Edward," and such like talk, 
Some without money that's bound to walk. 
Carriage and pair, with City nobs, 
here and there a 
cart load of jolly dogs, 
Prom a 
Circus show to a 
postman's cart, 
They're all on the road for they've made a 
goo3 start. 
Some's got about ninepence, others a 
dollar, 
There's a 
trap broke down, and the rest will 
follow. 
Some old married women, from their toe to 
their head, 
Rave got themselves up in the clothes they 
were wed, 
And brought beer and gin and a 
knuckle of 
ham, 
Mince pies and tarts made of raspberry jam. 
There's not too much room for twelve in a 
cart 
So in squeezing a 
seat, John sits on the tarts, 
With nice white ducks and short coat on, 
It looks as 
though there was something 
wrong, 
\Viten we went to see the Races. 
Upon the green there may be seen 
Punch and Judy, and Jack in the Green, 
Acrol.sats, and lots of prigs, 
The Woodrangers; Or, The Trappers of Sonora. 
Redolent of the wild forest and its wild and roving denizens.

Groups of niggers, and thimble rigs, 
Round-abouts, and booths for drink, 
Card-sharpers who'd make you think 
You can win a 
dollar, you have a 
try, 
You lose your money for a 
certainty. 
There's acting booths, and fighting shows, 
Circuses and men in rows, 
With Pinch-beck brass made up in pins, 
Brooches, purses, and penny rings. 
Organ men, and men with noses, 
Wooden dolls, and paper roses, 
Sandwich stalls and shooting alley, 
Cocoa-nut sticks, and Old Aunt Sally's; 
Country joskins and New York swells, 
Ugly, plain and pretty girls, 
Jews with plates of pickled sahnon, 
Lots of fun, without any gammon, 
Plenty of rows but no policeman, 
When you go to see the Races. 
And when the starting time arrives, 
To get by the side of the course you strive, 
You should have come sooner, it makes you 
wild, 
When you can't get near by a 
couple of miles. 
So we leave the cart in charge of a 
lad, 
To put a 
dollar is quite mad, 
So he makes his way through the crowd to the 
ring, 
What's the price of ? for that's the thing. 
You can have 0 
to 1—to go in I'm bound, 
Be knows he's a 
winner, so he leaves the 
ground, 
To look at the Races when in his horse comes, 
'Then hack to the ring for his money runs, 
The man he's skedaddled, for welsh'd he has 
been, 
Then Mrs. Brown calls Mr. Brown green. 
She lays hold of him never to part, 
They hunted the course, but where was the 
cart,

Texan life and its startling and bloody scenes brilliantly painted.

Then one Johnny Reilly, a

He loves her likewise, but alas, cannot nail her; 
Starkie wants to fight Radley, and show off his

Which the Peelers prevent, after mutual defiance. 
Jem meets Jane, asks her love, which the lad re-

But Reilly prevents him, and of Jane's love gives' 
up his share— 
If she'll marry Starkie and banish his dark despair. 
In the meantime young Radley, the plot overhears 
it,

The night has grown colder, and Benny is worse 
But he has been calling for you :

Perhaps before morning shall dawn. 
And this is the message she sent rue to bring: 
Come quickly, or he will be gone!

The Drunkard's Reply To His Child. 
[BY THEO. D. C. MILLER, M. D.] 
Yes, I 
will go with thee, my own darling child ! 
To our cottage, so lonely and drear, 
For the tempest increases, the night's datit and 
wild, 
And my little one trembles with fear. 
cruel and selfish, and wretched am I, 
To wander from those that I 
love, 
But I 
dreamed not thy own precious mother would 
die, 
And go with the angels above. 
CHORUS. 
But now I 
am sober, I'll go with the child, 
And kiss thy dear mother again ! 
She watches, and prayeth in accents so 
For the wretch by whose deeds she is slain. 
My frail little blossom, you've saved me from woe 
By your pleadings so gentle and mild, 
For hard is the heart that no anguish would know 
When rebuked by his own darling child ! 
I'm going to reform ! for I've killed my dear wife, 
Who loved me through sunshine and shade ! 
Oh ! help thy poor father to stand in the strife— 
The strife that the rum demon's made. 
But now I 
am sober, &c. 
Oh ! once there was joy in thy lone father's breast, 
And thy mother was cheerful and gay— 
Thyself and sweet Jenny our happy hearts blest— 
We thought not of blighting decay ! 
But gloomy hours came, for the tempest was near, 
To darken our cottage so bright, 
In blindness he led me, I 
followed him here, 
And welcomed the rum-drinker's blight ! 
But now I 
am sober, &c.

Oh, Minnie, my child ! can you love me again ?

Though I 
cannot shed griefs holy tear 1 
You say that you love me, my Own little one, 
And Jenny will comfort me too ! 
From the halls of the drunkard your father is won, 
To this pledge he will ever prove true. 
But now I 
am sober, &c. 
The angels have taken thy mother away 
To a 
world where no sorrow can come ! 
And though we are lonely, and dark is the day 
Thank God I 
I

Can cuter as victors no more

Yet sweeter an' fairer an' dear to my bosom,

I've Wandered In Dreams. 
I've wandered in dreams, to the moonlight's home, 
In fancy I've been where a 
thought could roam; 
I've blissfully gaze, on the sunny smiles 
Of the maidens who dwell in the starry Isles ; 
I 
have wakened from slumbers pure and free, 
From thine airy charms, to love but thee. 
I 
have dreamt about Eden's blissful bowers, 
And breathed the sighing of heaven's own flowers; 
I've heard the wild songs of the Paradise birds ; 
But ever in sleeping the mem'ry of words 
Once spoken by thee came sweet on mine ear, 
And the music around me no more would I 
hear. 
Oh! not more dear the honey'd flowers 
Just blown at morning, to the bee, 
Or to the garden, summer showers, 
Than thou, my love, art dear to me.

No other way of getting on, 
But scrambling to obtain it ?

The world is wide, there's land beside, 
There's room enough for all.

Oh, weep for the hour, 
When to Eveleen's bower

The moon hid her light 
From the heavens that night, 
And wept behind the clouds o'er the maiden's 
shame. 
The clouds past soon 
From the chaste cold moon, 
And heaven smil'd again with her vestal flame; 
But none will see the day 
When the clouds shall pass away, 
Which that dark hour left upon Eveleen's fame. 
The white snow lay 
On the narrow path- way 
Where the lord of the valley cross'd over the moor. 
And many a

door.

Soon melted away 
Ev'ry trace on the path where the false, lord came, 
But there's a

Which alone can remove 
That stain upon the snow of fair Eveleen's fame.

The Wounded Hussar. 
Alone to the banks of the dark-rolling. Danube 
Fair Adelaide hied when the battle was o'er: 
Olt whither, she cried, hast thou wander'd, my 
lover; 
Or where dost thou welter, and bleed on the 
shore ? 
What voice did I 
hear? ' twas my Henry that 
sighed,— 
All mournful she hasten'd, nor wander'd she 
far, 
When bleeding, and low, on the heath she de-
scried, 
By the light of the moon, her poor wounded 
hussar! 
From his bosom that heav'd, the last torrent was 
streaming 
And pale was his visage deep mark'd with a 
scar; 
And dim was that eye, once expressively beaming, 
That melted in love, and that kindled in war. 
How smit was poor Adelaide's heart at the sight, 
How bitter she wept o'er the victim of war! 
Hast thou come, my fond love, this sorrowful 
night, 
To cheer the lone heart of your wounded 
hussar ? 
Thou shalt live, she replied, heaven's mercy re-
lieving 
Each anguitshing wound, shall forbid me to 
mourn! 
Ah, no I 
the last pane- in my bosom is heaving 
No light of the morn shall to Henry return ! 
Thou charmer of life, ever tender and true 1 
Ye babes of my love that await me afar! 
Ms faltering tongue scarce could murmur adieu, 
When he sunk in her arms, the poor wounded 
hussar.

I 
Knew by the Smoke. 
I 
knew by the smoke that so gracefully curl'd 
Above the green elms. that a 
cottage was near ; 
And I 
said " if there's peace to be found in the 
world, 
The heart that was humble, might hope for it 
here." 
'Twas noon, and on flowers that languished around 
In silence repos'd the voluptuous bee ; 
Every leaf was at rest, and I 
heard not a 
sound, 
But the woodpecker tapping the hollow beech 
tree. 
And " here in this lone little wood," I 
exclaimed, 
" 
With a 
maid who was lovely to soul and to 
eye," 
Who would blush when 1 
prais'd her, and weep 
when I 
blani'd, 
How blest could I 
live, and how calm could I 
die! 
By the shade of yon sumach, whose red berry dips 
In the gush of the fountain, how sweet to recline, 
And to know that I 
sigh'd upon innocent lips, 
Which had never been sighed on by any but 
mine.

My peerless queen should be, 
The lovely maid of Erin, 
Who sweetly sang to me. 
Although the restless ocean 
May long between us roar, 
Yet, while my heart has motion, 
She'll lodge within its core ; 
For artless and endearing, 
And mild and young is she, 
The lovely maid of Erin, 
Who sweetly sang to me. 
When fate gives intimation, 
That my last hour is nigh 
With placid resignation 
I'll lay me down and die ; 
Fond hope my bosom cheering, 
That I 
in heaven shall see 
The lovely maid of Erin, 
Who sweetly sang to me.

calm, sweet summer day; 
But the image of her beauty, 
Shall never pass away. 
Alas! that one, &c.. 
Isle of Beauty. 
Shades of evening, close not o'er us, 
Leave our lonely bark awhile, 
Morn, alas ! will not restore us 
Yonder dirn and distant isle. 
Still my fancy can discover 
Sunny spots where friends may dwell, 
Darker shadows round us hover, 
Isle of beauty, fare-thee-well. 
' 'Tis the hour when happy faces 
Smile around the taper's light, 
Who will fill our vacant places ? 
Who will sing our songs to-night ? 
What would I 
not give to wander 
Where my old companions dwell ? 
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, 
Isle of beauty, fare-thee-well.

The Oath. 
" 
Do you," said Fanny, t'other day, 
" 
In earnest love me as you say; 
Or are these tender words applied 
To fifty girls alike beside." 
Dear cruel girl, cried I, forbear ; 
For by those eyes, these lips, I 
swear— 
She stoppld me as the oath I 
took, 
And cried, " You've sworn—now kiss the book."

Terence's Lament for Norah. 
Oh peace to thee, Norah, where'er be thy   
In the land of the stranger, beyond the wide 
sea; 
The billows that o'er thy bright pathway are swell-
Make haste to the shore, with no tidings of thee. 
When shall the hours that we pass'd in the mead-
ows, 
With pleasure and sunshine to spend the long 
day, 
Return to mark each fond feeling that led us 
To laugh all our cares in enjoyment away. 
The rosy spring comes, and it brings not thy like-
ness 
To brighten the landscape, or bloom in the vale ; 
She gives the young blossom thine own blossom's 
whiteness ; 
But where is the music that glowed in thy tale ? 
As the mid-
star of eve hides it blushes, to borrow 
New light from the orb that looks down on the 
sea: 
So hope in the heart finds a 
refuge from sorrow, 
When fancy looks bright with the image of thee,

'Tis Hard to Give the Hand. 
Tho' I 
mingle in the throng, 
Of the happy and the gay, 
From the mirth of dance and song, 
I 
would fain be far away; 
For I 
love to use no wile, 
And I 
can but deem it sin, 
That the brow would wear a 
smile 
When the soul is sad within. 
Thro' a 
parent's stern command, 
Claims obedience from me, 
Oh! 'tis hard to give the hand, 
Where the heart can never be.. 
'Tis hard to give, Sic. 
I 
have sigh'd and suffer'd long, 
Yet have never told my grief, 
In the hope that for my wrong, 
Time itself would find relief; 
I 
will own no rebel thought, 
But I 
will not wear the chain, 
That for me must still be fraught 
With but misery and pain. 
In all else I 
will be bland, 
But in this I 
must be free, 
And I 
will not give the hand, 
Where the heart can never be. 
And I 
will never, Sze.

DIE WI7CT'S 
TEN CENT ROMANCES. 
It is the object of the publisher of this series of popular low 
priced books, to present readers with a 
library of intensely in-
teresting fictions, based mainly upon real incidents—descriptive 
of Border, Indian, Trapper, and Hunter Life. 
Every book will 
be a 
complete novel of itself: 
Authors of first-class reputation 
will furnish the tales; which will far surpass in interest and 
graphic power any similar works ever published. 
Each book will contain one hundred pages, printed on fine 
white paper; and will be enclosed in a 
handsome cover, with an 
illustrated engraving; and sold at the remarkably low price of 
TEN CENTS. 
How Ready: 
r. 
No, I. THE DEMON OF THE DESERT. 
This book is one of the most powerfully exciting novels ever written. 
The 
scenes are laid in Southern Texas—the land of the rifle, the tomahawk and the 
scalping knife. 
Strange and terrible adventures crimsbn enaost every page. 
Wondrous contrasts keep the reader's attention engaged. 
The beautiful Prai-
rie Girl and the devilish half-breed—the generous young Hunter and the 
awful Fear of the Forest cross each other's paths. 
The fawn and the Ja-
guar—the dove and the vulture—are types of the unceasing struggle of In-
nocence and vice—perpetually occurring on every leaf of this startling book. 
No. 2. PRAIRIE PETE; or, to Trupors 
Of all the tales of wild adventure in forest and prairie, this is the most ex-
eellent. 
The reader seems to actually hear the yell of the demon red skins, 
sees their painted faces, and witness the lurid flames of the frontier log 
cabin. 
Hears, too, the sharp rifle creek of the hunter and the trapper as 
they send the unerring bullet of the avenger into the cruel hearts of the for-
est desperado. The vast expanse of the flower-carpeted prairie—the gloomy 
vista of the dense forest—the silver lake—the high peaked mountains, and 
the dark caverns, haunts of the wild cat and the grisly-bear, are all produ-
ced with vividness and wonderful power, in this captivating story.
