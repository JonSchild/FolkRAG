[Letter from John A. Lomax to Harold Spivacke, Chief,
Division of Music]
Port Aransas, Texas, 1/15/39
My dear Spivacke:
I sent several of my Library friends my unique, jingling, revealing Christmas card in
the confident belief that, at least, you or your more discerning lady would appreciate
its appropriateness and individuality to such a degree that you would send a word
of acknowledgment. Nary a word; which further confirms my long held belief that all
Christmas cards are worth than useless, futile and that they should be abolished by over
act of Congress.
I write especially to inform you that unless you and Alan, either or both, tell me that you
can loan me a recording machine I shall be forced to buy one, the product of which I shall
not feel obligated to turn over to the Library of Congress. Also, I wish to enquire whether
you think the Music Division of the Library, with its various charming officials, could stand
the strain of the presence of Miss Terrill and myself for a few months? A little later, when
the fishing is not so good and the fiddler crabs too busy with their babies to furnish their
nightly concerts, we may come up. Till then, and later, believe me, in high esteem, believe
me, always sincerely,
Joh n Lom ax
