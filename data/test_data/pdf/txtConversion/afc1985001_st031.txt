King Family Visalia, 1941
As I went down to the mowin' field Hoo rye too rye fod-a-link-a-die-do As I went down to
the mowin' field Fod! As I went down to the mowin' field A big black snake he got me by
the heel Too-oo-rally-day.
I fell down upon the ground Hoo rye too rye fod-a-link-a-die-do I fell down upon the ground
Fod! Well I fell down upon the ground Shut both eyes and looked all around Too-oo-rally-
day.
Set upon a stump to take my rest Hoo rye too rye fod-a-link-a-die-do Set upon a stump to
take my rest Fod! Set upon a stump to take my rest It looked like a woodchuck on his nest
Too-oo-rally-day.
The woodchuck grinned a banjo song Hoo-rye too rye fod-a-link-a-die-do The woodchuck
grinned a banjo song Fod! The woodchuck grinned a banjo song And up stepped a skunk
with his britches on Too-oo-rally-day.
The woodchuck and skunk got into a fight Hoo rye too rye fod-a-link-a-die-do The
woodchuck and skunk got into a fight Fod! The woodchuck and skunk got into a fight The
fume was so strong it put out the light Too-oo-rally-day.

played till the chimbley 'gan to rust It was hard to tell which smelled the wust Too-rally-day.
