Iron Curtain, but dey didn't 'llow us dere but only fouh hours. When Mr. Nixon was uh,
President, I much got all of that, I got all my gold certificates and everything right here.
(That's interesting!) Spoke in Tallahassee, befo' de Gov'nor, Mr. Rubin Akew, I spoke five
thousand and five hundred head of people was dere, and so dey was puttin' up dere new
place and tearin' down de ol' ... De done got it up, I think. (Is that a bigger place to talk?)

sea, and he's goin' to change, he's goin' to change tings ... He uh, dey start you know,
and I's following dem, and when, last meeting I met was in Tallahassee, and uh, Mr. Akew
and all of 'em ast de President, he say why don't you give up your resignation. He said

Washington and pay dem people off ... See dey free, dis man is be turn't loose right away.
You seen it on de radio. (What do you think about President Nixon, do you think he was
guilty?) Well, uh, now listen, that's a little bit more touchy question you ought not to ast
me. (Alright, I won't ask you that. What do you think of President carter?) Me? Why I tink,
I tink, I spoke for 'em, voted for 'em, worked for 'em. (You think that people don't get out
and vote enough?) Listen here, I wanna tell you sum'in. There's 80% of our people dat
ain't registered ... and uh, I tink de law, should pass a law, I know colored men, and white
men, ol' 50-60 years ol' men, dey ain't never registered, never voted atall. Now you know
that's not right. (No cause it's our right of being free and you know a lot about that, don't
you?) That's right, Yes'm. (They can't remember what its like to be free.) I tink on down de
line, I tink dis President, uh, bring dem all into it ... de knowledge of what you ought to do.
(Cause I think that
5
people will trust him and they'll want to get out and do the right thing.) Well, now, I'll tell
you, some people, you know it's hard, but you got to lead 'em to it, wid the righteous
people, with Jesus too, you got to lead 'em to it. I tink it's uh, you give him a little time, he's
done more right at once than ary President we ever had, and I've voted for every President
and started to vot'n I's vot'n fo' ol' Hans Cleveland. (Cleveland?) Yes'm. They paid all the
niggahs so much to sing a song, I was in it: "Cleveland got elected just as we expect'd.
Climin' up da golden stair, don't you hear de darkies singin', sweetly, I declare." (You still
