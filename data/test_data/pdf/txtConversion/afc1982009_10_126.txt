haul to market on stick. (Is this what she really says?) 
Used to put into 3 grades. 
SS has half interest in stringer. 
Finally says that they would tie into hands, pack onto 
basket to take to mkt. NOT haul to mkt on stick. 
She sets swell stems out from rest because if put in with 
rest will rot the rest. Swell stems are leavesthat 
didn't cure out; still soft and wet feetling. 
If pull too green leaves, they won't cure out properly 
no matter how much you cure it. 
Stopped working with RSXiafS mules about 12-lb yrs 
ago when got tractor. 
Oil sometmes flames up or smokes whic$ hurts the tob, 
sometimes they won't buy it at all if smoked, hence gas 
is best. 
Built walk in barn about 10 yrs ago. 
Says bulk barns are tie thing of the day. 
Got idea for form of barn from Hense Clements,a neighbor. 
Doesn't know where he got the idea. 
Sells in Mt Airy. 
Flea bugs get in tob that has blowed down more than that 
which ahsn't. 
250 lb is max allowable for dale in one bundle. Tim 
usually there to pack down. 
Her husband, Lem, trained mules. SS afraid of mules. 
Lem wouldn't cultivate with tractor. 
Can cultivate closer with mule than with tractor. Lem's mules 
12oo-1300 mules. Bladk. Benton Morefield's daddy shoed 
mules.

Outline 
All BS learned abt tob he "went right in the dirt and 
leart it." 
Too old to but 10,000 $ bulk loader. Hes got good 
"pole barns", stringer, etc. All his tob goes into 
two barns. 
1st pullings®"lugs" or "1st primings" Says in Canada 
they call them "sands". 2nds, thirds, liths etc. 
Last time ="tips". Don't talk of reds, etc. 
BS sells in Winston. Others go to Mt Airy. 
Doesn't like Harold Hodges' lack of "system", (he's 
Mt Airy warehouseman). System*schedule of when your 
tob to be sold. Won't set on floor for days till 
sold. Must designate where you will sell your tob anc 
must sell there. Must designate the last 3 days of 
each month. Good lack of system story. Talk of 
good system. 
Staory of nearly killing man because warehouseman wouldn'l 
unload tola. Preference to neighbors.
