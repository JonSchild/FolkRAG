THE MEN' THAT WE OUGHT TO AVOID. 
A man is oft known by the friends that lie keeps, 
For birds of a 
feather we find, 
Will oft flock together—and so to the fact, 
It is right we should never be blind 
how many a 
hope of advancement in 1-fe, 
Has been by false friendship destroyed ; 
So it cannot be wrong to name in my song, 
Some men you ought to avoid. 
CHORUS. 
Some sham to be gold, but with plenty of brass, 
You'll very soon find them alloyed, 
A man who seems this, and proves to be that. 
Is a 
man you ought to avoid. 
There is men who will borrow at every chance, 
Whom ' twere better at once to offend, 
But the danger is worse in knowing a 
man, 
Whose business is ever to lend; 
ITo has interest in you and from you as well, 
And e'en if of cash you're devoid, 
Your uncle who bangs out the three golden balls, 
Is a 
man that you ought to avoid. 
Some sham to be gold, & c. 
A lawyer who runs up his six-and- eight fees, 
A drunkard with unsteady ga t, 
A bra..wart whose talk is all full of bombast, 
As of wisdom is empty his pate; 
A liar whose word is a 
pitrall and snare, 
A 
ptirson whose time is employed 
Informing on crimes for the sake of the fines, 
These arc men that we ought to avoid. 
Some sham to be gold, & c. 
The egotist praising his own paltry deeds, 
Who'll of nothing but self ever speak, 
The smooth, fawning, oil talking, cat sort of man 
The tale-bearing, tit tattle sneak ; 
These all are the pests of our snug little i 
do, 
By which we are oftimes annoyed, 
Like sharks in the sea or flies in your tea, 
They are things that you ought to avoid. 
Some sham to be gold, & c.

YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL THE 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
When a 
child I 
lived at Flushing with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of childish play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mother say ; 
clioars. 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
Let your watch-word be despatch and practice what you preach, 
Do not let your chances like sunbeams pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on T 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seemed my only sport it was my only joy, 
And well do I 
remember when oftimes well chastised, 
How father sat beside me, and thus has me advised; 
Waste not, want not, ctc. 
When I 
arrived at manhood I 
embarked in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road, bestrewn with care and strife, 
speculated foolishly, my losses were severe, 
But still a 
little voice kept whispering in my ear. 
Waste not, want not, &c. 
Then I 
studied strict economy and found to my surprise, 
My funds instead of s'nking very quickly then did rise. 
I 
grasped each chance and always struck the iron while twas hot, 
I 
seized my opportunities and never once forgot: 
Waste nor, want not, &c. 
I'm m-trrie3 now an 1 
happy, I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony devoid of care and strife,, 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have little children three, 
The lesson that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee; 
Waste not, want not, & c.

THE GRECIAN BEND 
NEW VERSION. 
I 
saw my lovely Angelina, 
Going down Piccadilly to-day, 
When I 
saw her lovely features, 
How it set my heart a 
beating away; 
She was dress'd so neat, she look'd so sweet, 
Walking with a 
lady friend, 
How I 
laughed when I 
saw her 
Trying to do the Grecian bend. 
The Grecian bend, now go it, ladies, 
Shake yourself, and set us crazy, 
Double up and show the men, 
The style is now the Grecian bend. 
Her back it look' d 
just like a 
camel's, 
Because her head was near her feet, 
Like a 
man when he is hard up, 
Trying to make both ends meet; 
Such pretty feet and tassels neat, 
And of hair there was no end, 
I 
had to laugh when I 
saw her, 
Trying to do the Grecian Bend. 
The Greclas Bend, &c. 
I 
followed after AnceEni, 
Not thinking whet wound be the end, 
The boys they shouted as she passed them, 
"Miss, 
have your Grecian bend 1" 
When a 
fellow like me on a 
veloc:pede, 
H s 
weight about twelve stone ten, 
Ran slap against my Angelina, 
And away went her Grecian Bend. 
The Grecian Bend, tte. 
I 
rushed to rescue Angelina, 
But not before it was too late, 
There she lay upon the sidewalk, 
Oh ! in such a 
dreadful state; 
I 
said, " my dear, your lover's here!" 
She shouted out, " elt : hang the men 
See, he's been and gone and done it, 
And I've lost my Grecian bend." 
The Grecian bend, ite.

A SHILLING OR TWO.—[CoNcLuDED.1 
Now if you your friends would try, 
There's but one thing to do, 
Just ask them to lend you 
But a 
shilling or two. 
And you will find your sworn friends 
Turn their backs upon you, 
For it is dreadful to want 
Just a 
shilling or two. 
Chorus.—A 
shilling or two, a 
shilling or two, 
Friends can be bought for a 
shilling or two; 
Yes, yes, it is true, you'll find it is true, 
Friends can be sold for a 
shilling or two. 
Now, pray, do girls wed for love, 
Well p'rhaps some of them do, 
But they more often do wed 
Just a 
shilling or two. 
But mind, most men arc the same, 
But their folly they rue, 
Because real joy is not bought 
For a 
shilling or two. 
Chorus.—A 
shilling or two, a 
shilling or two, 
It oft proves a 
curse, a 
shilling or two; 
Young maidens are bought, and young men sold too; 
And all for what, just a 
shilling or two. 
Perhaps you may think it strange, 
Yet still it is true, 
But I'm singing these few lines 
For a 
shilling or two. 
And I've not been backbiting, 
For, search the wide world through, 
And all men you'll see fighting 
For a 
shilling or two. 
Ciorus.—A shilling or two, a 
shilling or two. 
Wonderful charms has a 
shilling or two; 
It buys things on earth, that's all it can do : 
But heaven's not bought for a 
shilling or two.

TEN THOUSAND MILES AWAY. 
Sing oh, for a 
brave and gallant bark, 
And a 
brisk and lively breeze ; 
A 
little crew and a 
captain too, 
To carry we over the seas; 
To carry me over the seas, my boys, 
To my true love so gay, 
She has taken a 
trip on a 
government ship, 
Ten thousand miles away: 
Cuoans.—So blow the winds I 
oh, a 
roving I 
will go, 
I'll stay no more on Manlutttan shore, 
So ict the music play ; 
-itart by the morning train, to cross the raging main, 
For I'm on the move to my own true love, 
thousand miles away. 
My true love she is beautiful, 
My true love she is young; 
Her eyes are blue as the violet's hue 
And silvery sounds her tongue; 
And silvery sounds her tongue, my boys, 
But while I 
sing this lay, 
She is doing the grand in the distant land, 
Ten thousand miles away. [So blow, etc. 
Oh ! that was a 
dark and dismal day, 
When last she left the strand, 
She bid good bye with a 
tearful eye, 
And waved her hay hand; 
She waved her hilly hand, my boys, 
As the big ship left the bay, 
And says she, remember me, 
Ten thousand miles away. (So blow, etc. 
Oh ! if I 
could but be a 
bos'n bold, 
Or only a 
bom-ba-dier: 
I'd hire a 
boat, and hurry afloat, 
And straight to my true love steer. 
And straight to my true love steer, my boys, 
Where the dancing dolphins play. 
And the whales and the sharks are having their larks, 
Ten thousand miles away. [So blow, etc, 
Oh ! the sun may shine thro' a 
Winter fog, 
The Hudson run clear and bright; 
The ocean's brine be turned to wine, 
And may I 
forget my beer. 
And may I 
forget my beer, my boys, 
And the landlord's quarter day,. 
But 
never part from my own sweetheart. 
Ten thousand wiles away. [So blow, ete.

May the muou be ttbrn'Ll'utq green cheesc, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
She can sing, she can play the piano, 
She can jump, she can dance, she can run, 
In fact she's a 
modern Taglioni 
And Sims Reeves rolled into one. 
And who would not love such a 
beauty 
Like an angel dropped from above, 
May I 
be stung to death with flies, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May I 
be stung to death with flies, 
If eyer I 
cease to love.

IF EVER I CEASE TO LOVE.—[CONCLUDED. 
Chorus.-11 ever I 
cease to love, 
if ever I 
cease to love, 
May little dogs wag their tails in Lront, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
For all the money that's in the Bank, 
For the title of a 
lord or a 
duke, 
I 
wouldn't exchange the girl I : ove, 
There's bliss in every look. 
To see her dance the polka, 
I 
could faint with radiant love, 
May the Monnment a 
hornpipe dance, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May we never have to pay the Income Tax, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
Chorus.—If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May we all turn into cats and dogs, 
If ever I 
ecaso Ao love. 
May all the seas turn into ink, 
May negroes all turn white, 
lay the Queen in Buckingham Palace live, 
May we drink too much wine to- night. 
May cows lay eggs, may fowls yield milk, 
May the elephant turn a 
dove, 
May Bobbies refuse to eat cold meat, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May I 
be stuffed with sausage meat, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
Chorus.—If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
ceaso to love, 
May each old maid be blessed with twins 
tf over I 
cease to live.

ALWAYS LIVE HIGH, AND DON'T SAY DIE. 
Arn—" Wait for the Turn of the Tide." 
We all must fight in the battle of life, 
And though we reverses meet, 
From the turmoil din, and struggling strife, 
It won't do to beat retreat. 
We may be downcast, still there no need is 
To faint, ei,dure sorrow and sigh, 
Be sure the only real way to succeed is— 
To look high, and never say die. 
CHORUS. 
Don't sigh, and never say die, my boys, 
But wait till the cloud is past : 
Don't sigh, and never say die, my boys, 
For the 81111 will break out at, last. 
If down in the world, don't have the hump, 
Eat a 
crust, till on beef you dine, 
And be content with a 
sup at the pump, 
Until you can quaff port wine. 
Look drawbacks full in the face, and never 
Despair to meet with a 
friend, 
To raise yourself use every endeavor, 
And some will a 
helping baud lend. 
Don't sigh, & o. 
Look up for success, not down on the ground, 
And keep on pushing ahead, 
The Philosopher's stone was never yet found, 
1)on't you by illusions be led, 
Trust in yourself, work night and morning, 
Be up with the lark in the shy. 
Be idleness, and tippling scorning, 
Stick to it, and never say die. 
D ,- n't sigh, & c. 
The sons of toil have become Lord Mayors, 
Plough- drivers Lave risen to fame, 
Poor Shepherds have filled Professor's chairs, 
And, my boys, you may do the same, 
Then stick to laLor, and never weary, 
Be honest in word and deed, 
And remember if one day is dreary. 
A bright one is sure to succeed. 
Dent sigh, & c.

I 
am a 
jovial collier lad. 
As blithe as blithe can be, 
For let the times be good or bad, 
They're all the same to me ; 
'Tis little of the world I 
know, 
And care less for its ways, 
For where the dog-star never glows, 
I 
wear away my (lays. 
CHORUS. 
Down in a 
coal mine, underneath the ground, 
Where a 
gleam of sunshine never can be found; 
Digging dusky diamonds all the season round, 
Down in a 
coal mine underneath the ground. 
Iy hands are horny, hard and black 
With working in the vein, 
And like the clothes upon my back, 
My speech is rough and plain ; 
Well, if I 
stumble with my tongue, 
I've one excuse to say, 
'Tis not the collier's heart that's wrong, 
'Tis the bead that goes astray. 
Down in a 
coal mine, &c. 
At every slift,.be't soon or late, 
I 
haste my bread to earn, 
And anxiously my kindred wait, 
And watch for my return : 
For death that levels all alike. 
Whate'er their rank may be, 
Amid the fire and damp may strike 
And fling his darts at me. 
Down in a 
coal mine, &c. 
How little do the great ones care 
'Wile sit at home secure. 
What hidden dan4ers colliers dare— 
What hardships they endure! 
The very fires their mansions boast 
To cheer themselves and wives, 
Ilayhap were kindled at the cost 
Of jovial colliers' lives. 
Down in a 
coal mine, &e. 
Then cheer up, lads, and make ye much 
Of every joy ye can. 
But let your mirth be always such 
As best becomes a 
man ; 
However fortune turns about 
We'll still be jovial souls, 
For what would nations be without 
The lads that look for coals. 
Down in a 
coal mine, &c.

( 
1 ) 
THAT'S WHERE YOU MAKE.-[CoNcLunEn.] 
Do not fancy you'll meet with a 
cabby, 
Who more than his fare will not take, 
May as well think an oyster could crawl up a 
tree, 
And there you would make a 
mistake. 
If you fancy a 
0'1 dislikes a 
small kiss, 
You must be-what some folks call-a 
cake: 
If you think your collector of taxes won't call, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
Don't imagine a 
man has no coin in his purse, 
Because he's not dress'd as a " swell," 
A book with a 
cover that's olden and worn 
Has often a 
good tale to tell. 
You'll oft see a 
swell, an collar, and cuffs 
To his finger-tips, white as snow-flake, 
But if you believe he's all over alike, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
The ladies still wear an abundance of hair, 
'Tis a 
wonder their dear necks don't break, 
But if you imagine they grow it themselves, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
When courting, don't write spooney letters 
To your fair one, for love, nor for sport, 
For should you but break any promise, 
They are sure to be read out in court. 
When you wed, do not marry the Liu'ly as well, 
For that wi1 not a 
paradise make ; 
Above all, close the door to Nnur mother-in-law, 
Or-that's where you'd make the mi,take. 
But-talking of marriage-reminds me, 
-We've given the Germans a 
shake: 
They fancied Louise and her cash was for them, 
That's where they made the miLtake. 
Don't imagine your milk is not " doctored," 
Nor quite pure is your two-shilling tea, 
Don't irnagiae it's awfully jolly, 
The first time you go on the sea. 
, 
Don't reckon your chicks before hatched, or 
Your duck may p'rhaps turn out a (hake, 
Don't go and eat mustard, and fancy it's jam. 
Or that's where you'll make the mistake. 
With all the advice I 
have given, 
You ought to be well wide-awake, 
And should you imagine I'll sing any more, 
That's where you mike the mistake.

ALWAYS ]
AXE THE BEST OF IT. 
Winter snows bring summer flow'rs, 
Harvest and the rest of it, 
Pleasant is this world of ours, 
If we make the best of it ; 
Misfortune boldly met by man, 
Adds but to the zest of it, 
Our life at most is but a 
span, 
Always make the best of it, 
CHORUS. 
So bear trouble like a 
man, 
Never go in quest of it. 
Life at most is but a 
span, 
Always make the best of it. 
Some fret and fume a 
long life thro,' 
While some are always jolly, 
And some give up old friends for new, 
And find their wisdom folly ; 
Love often fades 'neath Fortune's ban, 
Poverty the test of it. 
Our life at most is but a 
span, 
Always make the best of it. 
So bear trouble, &c. 
Now money means but money's worth, 
Tho' money's pow'r is great, 
While silver spoons are good at birth, 
Wooden ladles fight 'gainst Fate, 
Castle or cottage in life's plan, 
Host or but the guest of it-, 
Our lite at most is but a 
span, 
Always make the best of it. 
So bear trouble, &c. 
Friends, love, and money p:!ss away, 
Mere bubbles on life's river, 
And soon for us must come the day, 
When we leave all for ever. 
So let's be jolly while we can. 
Hang care—make a 
jest of it, 
Our life at most is but a 
span, 
Always make the best of it. 
So bear trouble, &c. 
SONG OF THE SEXTON. 
Oh, the sights that I 
see as I 
ply my lone trade, 
In the moldering dust that a 
cent'ry hath made, 
Where the coffin worm cloth creep. 
I 
began long ago, \viten my life was still green 
And my mattock and spade have been active, I 
ween, 
To fashion the grave so deep. 
Ho ! I 
laugh as I 
dig, for they all seek my aid, 
To provide them a 
home with my mattock and spade. 
The rich man hath pass'd me with towering head. 
But I 
sang o'er his grave when the scorner was dead, 
And laugh'd as I 
shoveled the mold. 
The hungry and wretched ne'er entered his door, 
His heart never bled for the wrongs of the poor, 
For the proud man well loved his gold. 
Ho! I 
laugh'd as I 
dug, for they wanted my aid, 
To provide him a 
home with my mattock and spade. 
I 
saw a 
young man in the fresh bloom of life, 
As he catne to the church with a 
trembling young wife, 
Lift against me the finger of scorn. 
Oh, the revel was joyous, the dance lasted long, 
But the shriek of the widow soon banished the song— 
The young man died ere the morn. 
Ho ! I 
laugh'd as I 
dug, when they came for my aid, 
To provide him a 
home with my mattock and spade. 
I 
saw a 
fair child bend her beautiful head, 
And cull the lone flowers that bloom o'er the dead, 
To form a 
pure simple wreath. 
The crimson of hectic suffused her pale face ; 
In her eyes fearful lustre I 
trembled to trace 
The herald of early death 
But I 
prayed that ere then, the deep home I 
have made, 
May close over me, and my mattock and spade.

THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG. 
One of TONY PASTOR'S Most Popular Comic Son gs. 
There's a 
dashing young clerk, here let me re.nark, 
his &Wry is ten dollars a 
week ; 
Yet he dresses in style, wears an elegant tile, 
And to keep up appearance will seek. 
Then at night, let me say, he at keno will play, 
With the boys around town go it strong, 
And the money tiles fast, but he's found out at last, 
And discovets that's where be was wrong, 
Yes, he finds out that's where he was wrong. 
As you go through the street, you are certain to meet 
Some gift enterprise jewelry store. 
" 
Heaps of riches each day here are given , away," 
You are told by a 
man at the door. 
You go in with the rest, your cash you invest, 
Think gold watches are had for a 
song. 
When your money you've sank, find each drawing a 
blank, 
And it strikes you that's where you were wrong, 
Yes, it strikes you that's where you were wrong. 
Just to pass time away, into court Cother day 
I 
rambled and took a 
seat. 
A poor girl had to sue, for the money was due, 
A 
slop-clothing man from Chatham street. 
Says the fellow " I'm bent I 
will not pay a 
cent, 
Doug-lt she sues me for ever so long." 
Says Judge Dowling, " Just so. 
Well, to prison you go, 
To convince you that's where you are wrong, 
Yes, I'll show you that's where you are wrong." 
Ninety-four years ago, as, of course, you all know, 
King George o'er these colonies reigned, 
B 
ut the Yankees awoke, and their shackles they broke— 
Our liberty Washington gained. 
John Bull, o'er the main boldly ventured again, 
But he found out Columbia was strong. 
Anirew Jackson they met. and they'll never forget 
how lie showed them that's were they were wrong, 
Yes. he showed them that's where they were wrong. 
It's a 
pleasure to me, your kind faces to see, 
Brightly beaming each evening around, 
Whlie here on the stage, I 
am bound to engage, 
Every novelty that's to be found. 
all do our best, and myself ' mong the rest, 
Always happy to sing you a 
song; 
But if you, think it's right, here to keep me all night, 
I 
can tell you that's where you are wrong.

WHY CAN'T PADDY BE A GENTLEMAN. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
I 
was told that Pat couldn't be a 
gentleman ; so I've set myself 
the task, 
That I 
to- night the reason why— of 
on my friends would ask ; 
Hasn't Ireland her colleges that have for centuries stood 
To teach the people? and you know, the teaching mighty good, 
haven't Irishmen got heads and hearts? 
13edad I 
know that's so; 
Then why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman? 
That's what I 
want to know. 
Spoken.—I 
should like to see it denied. 
Look at the record 
and you'll never ask— 
CHORUS. 
Why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman, agentleman—a gentleman. 
Why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman ? 
That's what I 
want to know. 
ff Paddy's not a 
gentleman, I'd like to know who is? 
You cannot give a 
reason why—each manly trait is his; 
lie's always first to help a 
friend, although his means are scant, 
And thro
l('
):m's fond of blarney, he bat
es dece it and cant. 
His coat may be of commo n f
ri
eze, 
hi s hear t 
won'
t f
reeze, 
oh, 
Then why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman? 
That's what I 
want to know. 
Spoken—If you know, tell me— 
Why can't Paddy, itc. 
Just read the Irish history ; and in that same you'll find 
Great deeds of Irish gentlemen ; St. Patrick's one, d'ye mind ? 
If great deeds then, ectoble men, all, worrah sore, it's true, 
Pat shows as long a 
list, my boys, as any one can do. 
And don't forget this, ye who sneer at honest Paddy's worth, 
That actions make the gentleman no matter what the birth. 
Fpokan—Sure, none of you can tell me— 
Why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman ? 
A 
gentleman, a 
gentleman I 
Why can t 
Paddy be a 
gentleman ? 
That's what I 
want to know

ALL AMONG THE HAY.—LCoNcLuDED.] 
She 's 
of bonny girls the queen, 
Born to be admied; 
Roaming out one day I'd been, 
Feeling rather tired, 
When as graceful as a 
fawn, 
She stood in my way, 
With a 
cask of " Barleycorn," 
All among the hay. 
Cuoaus.—All among the hay, & I) 
Of the beer I 
had a 
sup, 
Feeling then " all right;" 
She said 
to the brimming cup 
I 
was welcome quite." 
But she soon did me astound, 
Begg'd I'd go away; 
"Rakes," she said, " were often found 
All among the Lay." 
Cnoaus.—All among the hay, .:ke 
Still for all that I 
could see 
She was shamming cold; 
"Bought off" she should never be,

Sung by MRS. MAGGIE O'CONNELL. 
"riS sailing I 
am, at the dawn of the day, 
To my brother that's over the sea, 
But it's little I'll care, for my life anywhere, 
For it's breaking my poor heart will be. 
But a 
treasure I'll take, for old Ireland's sake, 
That 
prize all belonging above, 
It's a 
handful of earth, from the land of my birth, 
From the heart of the land that I 
love. 
And won't the poor lad in his exile he glad, 
When he sees the brave present I 
bring, 
And won't there be flowers, from this treasure of ours, 
ln the warmth of the beautiful spring. 
Olt, Erin Machree, though it's parting we be, 
It's a

And your mountains and streams. I

BROKEN- DOWN. 
Once I'd money plenty! 
And friends, too, by the score, 
Then fortune smiled upon Inc 
And no one passed my door, 
Now I'm poor and lonely, 
And not worth fifty cents, 
Now no one seem?, to know me, 
I'm completely broken down 
CHORUS. 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frown, 
No one seems to know me now, 
Because I'm broken down. 
With an ample fortune 
I 
went it rather fast, 
The pace was almost killing, 
And I 
found it couldn't last. 
Too proud to put the curb on, 
I 
thought myself high-bred, 
And now, for want of bread' at times 
I 
have to 
fast' inatead. 
I 
wander, 
The immortal Shakespeare 
Says, 
All the world's a 
stage' 
And every man must play his part. 
From childhood to old age; 
And when I 
think of days gone by, 
how I 
was made the tool 
Of rogues, and sharps, tis then I 
know, 
My 
part' has beea ' the tool.' 
I 
wander, 4:te. 
Friends could recognize me, 
When Poole he made my cant, 
But when I 
had no ' Note to change,' 
How soon they changed their nOte? 
An object sad and needy, 
I 
wander thro' the town, 
A 
living paradox am I, 
Hard up,' yet ' Broken Down.' 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frown, 
The time to try your friends you'll find, 
Is when you're broken down.

MARY AND HER LAMB. 
Au: :-" Mabel Waltz." 
From upward of a 
hundred manuscripts sent to the office 
of THE Sus, we select the following versions of the popu-
lar poem which relates the adventures of Mary and her 
lamb, as specimens of publi;; opinion on the subject con-
veyed in metrical form. 
The variety and surprising nature 
of the adventures in witieli Mary and the lamb— and par-
ticularly the lamb—are involved, indicate a 
considerable 
development of the imaginative faculty among the con-
tributers. 
These productions are in the stlietest sense pop-
ular poems. 
They emanate trout a 
part of the great con-
stituency who read Tut: Sus, :Aid are the artless, untutored 
utterances of the people. 
As such they will be sure to be 
appreciated. 
In most instances the authors modestly with-
hold their names ; but the verses which we print first, in 
point of style and finish and in imaginative power, singu-
larly resemble those choice morceaux, by the lion. You 
011all with which our metropolitan weeklies are occasion-
ally enriched. 
The envelope enclosing them bore the 
monogram of the Lotus Club, of which the Hon. Von. 0'11. 
is President. 
Dare we surmise that the poem is from his 
polished pen ? 
Here it is : 
Mary had a 
little lamb 
That couldn't read or write; 
When Mary offered him his hash, 
lier hand he'd always bite. 
Mary took her little lamb 
uound to the butcher's shop ; 
Then Mary's father gave a 
feed 
With lots of mutton chop. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
It jumped down in the well, 
Ana after Mary pulled it up 
It ran amid jumped down again, 
And was drowned. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
its eyes were heavenly blue. 
And it' you touch that little lamb 
" 
Ed put a 
head on you.'' 
And so the teacher turned him outs 
But still he lingered near, 
And waited patiently about, 
Then walked off on his ear."

MARY'S LAMB. (CONTINUED) 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
That acted very queer, 
For every time she told it to 
"I' would 
walk off on its ear." 
Bv this, at last, it broke its neck, 
-Then up at Mary looked. 
And murmured, as it closed each eye, 
Dear Moll, my mutton's cooked." 
Mary had a 
little lamb. 
It's tail went with a 
jerk. 
So she cut it off behind the ears, 
To

Mary had a

its fleece was white as snow, 
And every time it heard a

It bleated "Not for Joe." 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
its wool was black as ink, 
And everywhere that Mary went, 
The lamb went too. I 
think. 
— — 
He followed her down town one day, 
Which made Miss Mary swear; 
She caught hint by his little neck, 
And pulled him by the hair. 
She made him " walk upon his ear." 
And used him like a 
brute. 
Then ": put a 
head " upon the clear, 
And 
bust him in the snoot." 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
All covered o'er with wool; 
lie wandered to the Stock Exchange, 
And tried to be a 
Bull. 
The brokers greeted him with joy, 
Approached him With a 
query, 
And offered to give him a 
certain point. 
On a 
few hundred shares of Erie. 
The Bears embraced him with a 
hug, 
And urged him to take a 
risk ; 
But he vowed and swore he would'nt go in 
Until he could see Jim Fisk.

For Jim he went to the Opera House. 
And wagging his tail with a

"How does the old thing work ?" 
But Jim replied in his choicest French 
Prenez garde you dot get soled ;

The last that was seen of the little lamb 
Was at the corner of Broad and 
He was going toward the stock Exchange, 
Aud never came back at all. 
Mary had a 
little lamb 
As round as any gherkin. 
She took to school the old thing once— 
That's how it was a

It made the children laugh and play 
To see a 
sight so new— 
A little boy to Mary cried : 
"I'll put a 
head on you." 
The teacher unto Mary said, 
You cunning little elf, 
Why did you thus ?" and Mary said, 
You know how 
yourself?" 
When Mary had to leave the school, 
She cried in a 
sad, sad manner, 
And went to bed, and softly said, 
-That's what's the matter with Hannah."

Mary had a 
little lamb, 
it pleased Ulysses S. 
She sent it on to -Washington, 
And now she's Postmistress. 
Mary had a

It drank cold water freely, 
And looked so innocently wise, 
She called it Horace Greely. 
" 
Mary had a 
little Lamb," 
I've heard so often said, 
That all I 
know about it is, 
I 
wish that Lamb was dead. 
A contributor to the Virginia (Nev) Enterprise furnishes 
to that paper the following: 
"I cannot help writing poetry, 110 matter how hard I 
try. 
Legal, medical and theological advice has been taken in 
vain—nothing stops it— it must come. My 
friends have advis-
ed me to persevere, and I 
mean to do it. 
My last (and best) 
effort is as follows ; 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
They got it very cheap, 
And when it was tired of being a 
lamb, 
It grew up into a 
sheep. 
One day it followed her from home, 
And didn't know what to think 
When it saw the people going around 
Inside the skating rink 
Then the lamb said ; 
very quee r. 
What ever could have got em ! 
Just then poor Mary tumbled down, 
And humped her. little—ilead.

MAXI'S LAMB. ( CusTiNcED,) 
Whenever Mary came from school, 
Her mother quick she sought, 
And gave her not a 
moment's peace 
Until her lamb was brought. 
And everywhere that Mary went 
The lamb was sure to go, 
Because when asked if she'd have more, 
She never answered " No." 
What made dear Mary like the lamb, 
Does any one inquire ? 
Because she knew how good it was, 
When roasted by the lire. 
Ard when served up with good mint-sauce 
And fresh green peas you'll know 
ow tis yourself, awl understand 
Why Mary liked it so. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
It's fleece was white as snow, 
And anywhere that Mary went, 
That lamb it wouldn't go. 
So Mary took a 
stick. one day. 
And lammed it for a 
spell— 
They had him with green peas next day 
And he went very well. 
Mary had a 
little iamb. 
She laid it on a 
shelf, 
And every time it wagged it's tail, 
"You know how ' tis yourself." 
Mary had a 
little lamb. 
That was all over white, 
She put his hide on every day, 
And to keep it from wearing out too fast 
She took it oft at night. 
Mary had a 
little lamb. 
That stayed with her at home,

SHE WAS FAT, SHE WAS .FAIR.—[CoNctunED.] 
I 
often had dealt at her shop, 
When her manner appear'd rather strange; 
She'd smile, or a 
soft word let drop, 
And forget p'rhaps to give Inc my change. 
I 
began to feel funny myself, 
And one day, with my heart in a 
flutter, 
I 
told the dear creature my love, 
The while she was patting her butter. 
Spoken.—Ah ! 
you should have tasted her celebrated " Eight 
penny fresh." 
Oh! but— 
Mx— She was fair, eze. 
She at first seem'd to not understand, 
Smiled as though it her fancy did tickle ; 
And in trying to squeeze her dear hand, 
I 
knoek'd down a 
jar of tnix'd pickle! 
I 
begg'd of her ten thousand pardons, 
And offer'd the damage to pay; 
But she wouldn't allow it, and hinted 
That the lot might be mine some fine day. 
Spoken.—Oh, blissful visions of bloaters, pickles, and hair-oil, 
bundle-wood and cheese, tin-tacks and treacle, Fuller's earth and 
figs, hair-pins and butter, Flanders brick and bacon, blacklead and 
German sausage,—and there was full twenty stone of the darling 
herself, for— 
Cho.—She was fair, 
Next door to my love lived a 
baker, 
Confound him !—too partial to chat; 
I 
so oft found him in at the widow's, 
That I 
fancied some game he was at. 
The worst of it too, he was single, 
And, as I 
thought, made rather too free; 
One day how it made my ears tingle 
When I 
heard him invited to tea. 
Cho.—She was fair, dr.c. 
The next time I 
call'd at the widow's, 
She was in at the baker's next door, 
But she'd left a 
small note which inform'd me 
That I 
needn't call there any more. 
Widow, shop, and all snatch'd from my grasp; 
By the baker I'd nicely been done; 
He married the widow last week— 
Now they've knock'd the two shops into one. 
Cho.—She wa3 fair, ctc.

ALL FOR MONEY. 
By J. W. CHErtar. 
What will not most people do, 
All for money ! 
Anything, ' twixt I 
and 3
-on, 
Ail for money ! 
Friend will turn his back on friend, 
Haught v 
people have to b • nd, 
Love some to Old Harry send, 
All for money. 
As you trivel on through life, 
You will find it ever so, 
Nothing like the ready cash, 
For money makes the mare to go. 
Sume will swear that black is white, 
All for money I 
Do a 
wrong and say its right, 
All for money! 
Moses he will swear to you, 
His old clothes are good as new, 
Don't he make them fit you too! 
All for money. 
As you travel on, dre 
Pretty girls can love old men, 
All for money! 
Even wed three score and ten, 
All for money ! 
'Tis but a 
fool who ever dreams, 
That ev'rything is what it seems, 
The world is full of mocking schemes, 
All for money. 
As you travel on, cfre 
Many people go to law, 
All for money, 
Dentists nearly break your jaw, 
All for money; 
[
1] 
ALL FOR MONEY. [ CONCLUDED ] 
Tradesmen give you unjust weight, 
Beggars tease early- and late, 
Garrotters kindly on you wait, 
All for money. 
As you travel on, tte. 
Lawyers plead the felon's cause, 
All for money, 
Vows he has not broke the laws, 
All for money. 
Had he been on Vother side, 
What a 
diff'rence and how wide. 
To make him guilty he'd have tried, 
All for money. 
As we travel on, clic. 
Don't the bobbies do the trick, 
All for money, 
And to anything they'll stick, 
All for money, 
Kinder souls you never knew, 
Let theta once get hold of you, 
Then you'll see what they can do, 
All for money. 
As we travel on, ex. 
Don't the doctors physic you, 
All for money, 
Give black draughts and blue pills too, 
All for money. 
What their patients all endure, 
Any saint would try I'm sure, 
They're good to either kill or cure, 
All for money. 
As we travel on, & c. 
Chalk and water milkmen sell, 
All for money, 
Something else perhaps put as well, 
All ror money, 
Thus I 
will conclude my strain, 
With a 
sentence short and plain, 
Everyth ing is done for gain, 
All for money 
As we travel on,

CASTLES IN THE AIR. 
As sang by Gus Wit.niAms. 
This world is all a 
bubble, wherever we may go, 
There's nothing here bat troubles, hardship, toil and woe; 
Go where we will, do what we may, we are never free from care, 
.And at the best, this world is but a 
Castle in the Air. 
We are rocked upon the sea of life, just like a 
little boat, 
And some get wrecked upon the rocks, and never get afloat; 
But we will do the best we can, anti never let despair 
Usurp the place between us, and our Castles IL 
the Air. 
There is a 
name known o 
er the world, to Englishmen ' tis dear, 
And well may they he proud of him, their native Bard Shake-
speare ; 
When first his plays came en the stage, he made the world stare 
And yet they were composed, while building Castes in the Air. 
If you take the works of Shakespeare, and study them well 
through, 
You 11 find his sayings are so wise, each sentiment so true; 
They'll make you feel while reading them, as ify on had been there, 
And yet they were composed while building Calles lathe Air. 
Bat yet there is another name, to Seotehmen ("earer still, 
And though a 
real true Scottish heart, ' twil make the blood to 
thrill, 
And though this world t ) him had been, a 
worldfull of care; 
Yet Burns was always happy, building Castles ii the Air. 
His home a 
lowly Ploughman's Cot, yet strife thee ne'er was sae; 
So happy and contented had he lived wee his Jan; 
Beside the bank 0' Bonny Doon, near to the tom O'Ayr, 
The immortal Bobby Burns, built bright Castbs in the Air. 
The Irish had their poet too, they loved him nn/1 I'm sure. 
He was a 
true born Irishman, his name was Thinias Moore; 
Of this world's sorrows, we know lie had his slue, 
Yet Moore was always happy, building Castlesin tli• Air. 
Ile sang the rights of Ireland, he sang againsther wrongs, 
And many loving Irish hearts, wil' cherish ye his songs ; 
Ho made the Irish heart rejoice, he bade themne'er despair, 
And for Ireland in the future, Built bright Catles in the Air.

KISS IN THE RING. 
Who'll come out in the fields to play? 
Who will join in our game of glee ? 
When I'm out for a 
holiday, 
Kiss in the ring's the game for me. 
Walk round the ring, and then touch 'em so, 
Oh, I 
oh ! oh, I 
oh ! 
After each other away we go, 
Oh, I 
oh ! I 
oh ! 
CHORUS. 
Kissing in the ring's the game, 
Jolliest that I 
can name, 
Out in the fields so gay and free, 
Kiss in the ring is the game to play. 
Over the fields away we run, 
O'er the daisies we scamper fast ; 
Catching isn't so easily done, 
Tho' we're bound to be canht at last. 
Then when we're caught do they kiss us ? No 
Oh, I 
oh ! Oh, I 
oh ! 
Back in the ring we are boil : d

Oh, I

Back to t e ring again we walk, 
Out of breath with our run so rough ; 
Lots of time for a

If you've run with him far enough. 
Safe in the ring then we both kiss, oh ! 
Oh, I 
oh 1 
oh, I 
oh 
Well, it's all in the game you know, 
Oh, I 
oh I 
I

And so a 
pleasant hour is pass'd, 
In summer, autumn, or in spring ; 
And when at night we sleep at last, 
We dream p'rhaps of another ring. 
For kiss in the ring, as I

Ala 
Wearing of the Green." 
A victim of Circumstances and a 
Bashful Irishman 
Were seen, one morning, to dance the French Can-Can; 
The Lancashire Lass was seen a 
Taming of the Shrew, 
With Barney, the Baron, on her arm to help the matter through. 
The:Grand Duchess stoops to Conquer, Under the Gaslight After Dark, 
With Black-eyed Susan by her side : Oh ! isn't she a 
lark 
Shylock keeps in Chatham streA a 
Lager-Dior Saloon, 
Where Hamlet and the Orange Girl will spend their Honeymoon. 
/ The Ticket-of Leave- Man's troubled, lest he'll be sent to Botany-Bay ; 
Hots Waitin.; for the Verdict, and I 
think he'll see Foul Play; 
The Ghost of Hamlet's Father was heard to raise a 
buzz; 
The Emerald Ring will glitter, when Ireland's as it was. 
The Man with the Carpet-bag was seen to steal a 
silver spoon, 
Has Ben Butler for his counsel, and he'll be Caste out soon ; 
ICs mighty odd for Tommy Dodd he's always safe to win, 
lie's run away, and married to the beautiful East Lynne. 
The Gentleman from Ireland is In and Out of Place, 
There's No Thoroughfare in Camden where a 
horse can run a

Jack Sheppard robbed Othello; Falstaff's got a

With Coriolatms on his back, to sing him I.. an O'Linn 
The Tempest has subsided, now we'll have a

There's something wrong, I'm thinking, with the Rose of Ettrick Vale. 
Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist are true friends now, I'm told, 
That's nothing new however; for, they were friends of old, 
Paul Pry is on His Last Legs: Robert Emmet lost his life, 
Ring Richard the III. has run awiy with the Flying Dutchman's wife. 
A terrible Flash of Lightning was seen on the Jersey shore, 
The Rivals have had a

The Forty Thieves are all in jail, for making too much noise: 
The Toodles have run away with one of Julius Cmsar's boys. 
Our American Cousin's married. and Dundreary be has sneezed, 
Dick Turpin courted Jenny Lind and her hand he gently squeezed ; 
The Tame Cat began to howl ; the Wild Cats grew too fast, 
Shakespere woke up from his dream, and there was Light at Last. 
There was Much Ado About Nothing when Lucullus slew the Male,

IT'S NAUGHTY, BUT IT'S NICE.—[CONCLUDEL 
Last night I 
called at Westbourne Grove, 
And asked if she would go 
A walk, and we would talk of love; 
At first she answered, " No I" 
Then consented, and we walked and talked— 
I 
thought it paradise,— 
But she said 'twits wrong; I 
answered,— 
Well, it's naughty, but it's nice.—Crio. 
I 
put my arm around her waist, 
Her form I 
gently pressed; 
And then she laid her lovely face 
Upon my manly chest. . 
I 
kiss'd her two times on the cheek, 
I 
would have kissed her thrice, 
But I 
whispered, Ain't it naughty I 
She said, Yes, but it's so nicc.---C110. 
To-day she asked if she might wed, 
Her ma exclaimed, My dear! 
You must not think of marrying Fred 
For many and many a 
year: 
It's wicked, miss, your pa and ma 
And home to sacrifice. 
To get married—well, I 
know, said she, 
It's naughty, but it's nice. 
Cno.—If you think marriage wicked, ma, 
You're guilty of that vice; 
You perhaps may call it naughty-, 
But you also know it's nice. 
Her parents have consented, and 
In two years she will be 
My wife; so now you know my tale: 
I 
hope you will give to me 
The same applause, that from you all 
So often I 
entice ; 
It's naughty p'rhaps to ask it, 
But to get it is so nice.—Cao.

I KNOW SOMETHING. 
Written, Composed and sung by Gus Wnazems, 
know something which I 
don't mind telling you, 
But keep it a 
secret, now mind, 
I3ecourse off my wife was to find it out, too. 
I 
know that mit rage she'd go blind 
It's about a 
young girl what I 
meet th'other day, 
While walking along in the street— 
And I 
know off this young girl know'd I 
had a 
wife 
he wouldn't think I 
was so sweet. 
Now you know what I 
know, and what my wife don't know, 
She don't know what I 
know, and what I 
know you know, 
If you tell her what you know, and also what I 
know, 
Then she'd know what I 
know, what you know also. 
I 
know that this young girl wore lots of false hair, 
I 
could see dat at once at a 
glance, 
I 
know that her feet was much larger than mine, 
I 
found dat out when we did dance. 
She got beauty spots all over her face, 
I 
don't want to make fun at all, 
She'd a 
mole on her cheek as red as a 
beet, 
And it look'd like a 
big cod-fish ball. 
Now you know what I 
know, & e. 
This girl's hair was red or a 
stra wherry blonde, 
Her eyebrows hung down to her nose ; 
She'd a 
mouth dat when open looked like a 
mouse- trap, 
It worked on a 
spring, I 
suppose. 
But still she's a 
beauty longside of ray wife. 
To- morrow I 
get a 
Divorce— 
And the secret 
dont mind telling you— 
', I 
marry this young girl, of course. 
Now you know what I

Out in this cold world, out in the street, 
Asking a 
penny of each one I 
meet, 
Shoeless I 
wander about, thro' the day, 
Wearing my young life in sorrow away. 
No one to help me, no one to love, 
No one to pity me, none to caress— 
Fatherless, motherless, sadly I 
roam; 
A 
child of misfortune, I'm driven from home. 
CITORUS. 
No one to he7p me, no one to bless, 
No one to pity me, none to caress; 
Fatherless, motherless, sadly I 
roam, 
Nursed by my poverty, driven from home. 
The flowers that bloomed, that I 
loved to see, 
Seem bowing their heads as if pitying me; 
The music that mingles with vciets of mirth, 
From the windows of pleasure and plenty on earth, 
Makes me think what it is to be friendless and poor— 
And I 
feel I 
shall faint when I 
knock at the door; 
Turn a 
deaf ear, there's no one will come 
To help a 
poor wanderer driven from home. 
No one to help me, &c. 
Oh! where shall I 
go, or what can I 
do ? 
I've no one to tell me what course to pursue: 
I'm weary and footsore, I'm hungry and weak, 
I 
know not what shelter to night I 
may seek. 
The Friend of all friends, who rules earth and sea, 
Will look with a 
pitying eye upon me ; 
I'll wander about, till his messenger comes 
To lead me to father and mother at home. 
No one to help roe,

THE IRISH RECRUIT. 
Ata:—"Paddy O'Rourk." 
Teddy O'Ran had a 
valliant heart, and to fight was mighty 
willing; 
To the sargeant Paddy marched, and took the 'listing shilling. 
Faith Ill be promoted soon, says he to Corporal Cacy, 
For I've shouldered the hod for many long years, it will tach 
me to shoot aisy. 
Wid a 
row dow dow, & c. 
SroKEN.—Hould up your head, stys the sargent. 
That's what 
I'm always after doing—excepting whin I've got a 
whiskey 
faver, and thin it is a 
bit lobsider]. 
Turn out your toes, says he. 
Faith and sure don't. you see my toes are out already; and faith, 
that was true for me, for both shoes were out at elbows, and the 
only stockings I 
had were bare feet. 
Stand at ease, cried he. 
How will I 
be after doing that same? 
Sure and faith, said I, I 
never stand at ease but when I 
set down. 
Shoulder arms, cried 
he. 
Would you have me shoulder legs? says I. 
Right about 
face, says he. 
Oh, rm all right about the face, - says I. 
To the 
right wheel, says he. 
If it's the same thing to you, I 
would 
sooner have a 
tazte of tnutton. 
Order arms, says he. 
Where 
will I 
order thim ? says I. 
Load, says he. 
The cart or the bar-
row, says I. 
Fire, says he. 
Where, says I. 
Charge, says he. 
Three and a 
kick says I, 
Take that, says he. 
And by powers 
of Poll Kelly he was after latting me such a 
crack that made 
me sing 
Row de dow, & c. 
At last they drill'd and brac'd me up, and fitted me for battle, 
And MT we march'd to the field of fight, where the cannons loud 
did rattle. 
There the blood did run about just like pools of water, 
Paddy, says they, now which is the best, the gun or the hod wid 
de mortar, 
SPONEN.—Phat was the use of disliking that same ? 
They told 
me I 
cud but die once faith, but 1 
saw many a 
poor fellow killed 
two or three times. 
At last it came to my turn— for a 
ball come 
and knock'd me down as dead as a 
herren. 
Get up out of that, 
says the sargent. 
How can I, says 1, sure and don't you see I 
am kilt. 
The devil a 
bit, says he. 
Sure then, I'm helpless, 
says I—snd that's just as bad. 
While he was going on so, 1.ad 
luck to me but a 
ball come3 alez,g, and takes off his leg. 
My 
leg's gone, says he. 
Which leg ? says I. 
31v left, says he. 
Oeh, then, says I, your right is left. 
How's that? says 
he ? 
Because it's the only one that'sleft. 
So at last we beat the foe, 
and the drummers bate, and I 
was taken off the field wid the 
killed and wounded, got my discharge wid a 
thumping penchan, 
which they never pay, causing me to sing 
Row, de dow, &e.

THE REFORMER ON THE SLY . 
Revised and Sung by JOHNNY Itoicti with great Success. 
Good people all, take my advice, and listen unto me, 
But don't put too much confidence in every man yon see, 
They say, fine feathers make fine birds, but not so every one, 
For men will often wear broadcloth, to hide their little 
ame, 
But whether they are fish or fowl it makes no difference to 1, 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
reln:mer on the • Iv. 
ae 
There are fifty kinds of swindling-mills in the papers every day, 
And lotteries where you draw a 
farm f
.Clod knows how far awly ) 
There's politicians now-a.days that at public expens ,, 
They rob our city government and leave it not worth a 
cent, 
I 
wish for once I 
was a 
Judge, and had those thieves to try, 
They'd get sent up and polished off', by a 
reformer on the sly. 
There's Madam Morris, from Corsica, who with her telescope, 
Your future wife or husband shows. 
Good grace us that's a 
joke, 
If you give to her but fifty cents, she'll send you a 
card by mail, 
I 
think they ought to find her a 
home, six months in the county 
jail. 
There's the seventh daughter of the seventh son to swindle you. 
they'll try, 
But I 
know their little euchre game, I'm a 
reformer on the sly, 
In Chatham street, the other day I 
took a 
walk along, 
I 
heard a 
fellow crying out, going, going, gone. 
Who Nds for it, this fine gold watch, the finest ever seen, 
The thought I 
was a 
little fiat—rerhaps a 
little green— 
I 
says, excuse me, please, if I 
wink so with my eye, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
reformer on the sly.

LONG BARNEY. 
Did yez ever hear tel of Long Barney, 
Who came from the sweet grove of Blarney, 
From the turn of whose eye, the girls would all sigh— 
For, they all had a 
liking to Barney. 
Did you ever hear tell of his fighting ? 
A thing that he took great delight in ? 
When he handled his stick, how the boys he would lick, 
he'd floor them all round, would Long Barney. 
He went to the fair, it being Easter, 
In his pocket he'd many a 
tester, 
There he met Biddy Twig, and wid her ne'd a 
jig, 
And fell .deep in love, did Long Barney. 
Then into a 
tent he did take her, 
To give her a 
drop of the crathur, 
With his arms round hr waist, her sweet lips he did taste, 
She cried, "• Och ! you'll smother me, Barney I' 
Then in came big Da- by O'Brien, 
Who for Biddy had long had an eye on ; 
" 
Arrah ! Biddy," suit! he, " come over to me 
And don't sit there listening, to Barney." 
Said Barney, " I'll soon make you toddle," 
And hit him a 
crack on the noddle, 
When whack went their sticks, on the floor Darby kick 
Faith ! he dusted his jacket, did Barney. 
Said Barney, " 'Tis Biddy for you then, 
The devil I'd fight it is true then, 
And if any spalpeen dare step out on the green— 
Faith I 
I'll scuttle his nub,' cried Long :Barney. 
And then he sat down by his Biddy, 
While the fighling and punch made him giddy, 
lie buzzed in her ear, " Sweet Biddy, my dear, 
'us yourself I 
will marry," said Barney. 
With a 
good deal of blushing and twisting, 
She at length said. " There is no resisting, 
And my father Tim Twig, says he'll give a 
pig 
To the man that will marry me, Barney." 
" 
Sure my father will give me another, 
And we'll soon make them sister and brother ; 
And wid children and pigs, little Barneys and Twigs, 
We'll soon stock the cabin of Barney."
