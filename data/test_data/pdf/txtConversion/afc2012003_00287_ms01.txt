About Luciana “Lucy” Loyal and Zefta “Dolly” Pirtle 
 
Lucy Loyal and Dolly Pirtle are sixth generation members of the Loyal Repensky family 
which came to America in 1932 to join the Ringling show. Repensky was the maiden name 
of Jules Loyal’s mother and only Loyals performed. Natives of France with a long history of 
performing in numerous circuses around Europe, this horseback riding act included various 
acrobatic formations and feats accomplished on horseback. Their act included a seven 
person pyramid based on five horses. At one time it was considered one of the highest class 
equestrian troupes in the United States.  
 
With time, and as the members of the troupe married, members of the Loyal family 
developed specialties of their own. The Alfonso Loyal Repensky troupe quickly earned a 
reputation as an excellent bareback riding act and Lucy Loyal, the daughter of Alfonso, was 
one of the stars. Lucy was born in 1949 in Sarasota, Florida and in 1955 her family made 
their first trip to Hugo, Oklahoma where they joined the Al G. Kelly Miller Show. Lucy was 
already performing at this time. By 1965 her family had moved to Hugo and was performing 
for the Carson and Barnes Circus with whom Lucy continues to be associated. Lucy’s 
children and grandchildren are involved with the circus industry. 
 
Dolly Pirtle is the daughter of Zefta Loyal Perez and Raymond Perez. Zefta was a member 
of the Loyal Repensky family and performed in the bareback horse act. Dolly, at a young 
age, learned aerial acts and performed on the trapeze until she graduated from high school. 
At that time, she married and left the circus life. Dolly, instead, pursued a career in law 
enforcement and is a retired detective in Henderson, Texas. Even though she did not devote 
a career to the circus, she has very fond memories and can still perform a trapeze routine, if 
only in her mind.  
 
Both Lucy and Dolly have cherished memories of their grandparents, aunts, uncles, parents, 
cousins, and themselves as their lives evolved around the center ring. Circus provided them 
many life lessons from practicing hard to laughing much…and how little water is absolutely 
needed when showering!

My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn and with me is Tanya Finchum. We’re 
with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library. 
Today is Thursday, June 30, 2011, and we’re in Hugo, Oklahoma, 
interviewing Luciana Loyal, also known as Lucy—a little easier to say—
and also, Zefta Pirtle, but we like to call her Dolly. Does that sound 
right? 
 
That’s good. 
 
All right. Thank you for joining us today. We really appreciate it. We’re 
going to begin with Lucy. Lucy, I’d like you to tell us where you were 
born, what year, and give me a little bit of background on your parents. 
 
Okay, I was born in Sarasota, Florida, in 1949 at Sarasota Memorial, and 
my doctor’s name was Dr. Miller, but the pediatrician was Dr. Olson. 
Now, my father was born in Milan, Italy. My mother was born in 
Florence, Italy. My father’s name was Alfonso Loyal. My mother’s 
name was Lilia Panini. My father came to the United States in 1932 with 
Ringling Brothers Circus. My mother wasn’t from show business. She 
was, as we call, a towner, but her uncle joined the circus. He joined a 
teeter board act. Somehow or other he met my father’s sister and he 
married my aunt Albertina. He was here in the United States before the 
war broke out in Europe, the Second World War. Mom, of course, was 
in Italy, in the war.  
 
Well, after the war my uncle would write to my mother, or his sister, and 
my mother was his favorite niece in Europe. Somehow or other, through 
the writing she sent my uncle, or her uncle, a picture. My father just 
happened to see this picture and asked my uncle if he would mind if he 
wrote to her. So my father would write my mother and they fell in love

through these letters. Then in 1948, the family brought my mother over 
from Europe, into Baltimore, and that’s how come I’m here. They got 
married and here I am! (Laughs) 
 
All right. Dolly, tell me a little bit about where you were born, what 
year, and then a little bit about your parents. 
 
I was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1944 at the Cook County Hospital. My 
father’s name is Raymond Perez. My mother is Zefta Loyal-Perez. She 
came to this country in 1932 with Ringling Brothers. In fact, Lucy and I 
are first cousins. Her dad is my mother’s brother. There were five other 
brothers and sisters that were also involved in the circus. We wintered in 
Sarasota, Florida. My dad’s family, they were somewhat circus. They 
were in it for a little while and then they got out of it. That’s how my 
mother met my father, was with the Ringling Brothers, because they 
were performing with them also.  
 
I grew up in Sarasota, Florida. I was in the circus, did flying trapeze, did 
trapeze, and after I got older I was in Sailor Circus, which was part of 
the Sarasota High School. That’s where I went to school. Then I met my 
first husband, and he was from Texas, and I ended up moving to Texas. I 
got out of the circus and I ended up going into law enforcement and 
became a detective, and then I married a sheriff. 
 
My mother, however, stayed in the circus. She stayed in the circus until 
she retired. She always told me, she says, “Dolly, I will retire center 
ring. I will never stay long enough to where I’m going to be in the side 
ring,” and that’s what she did. She retired in 1954, I believe it was, in the 
center ring. She said, “I’m getting on up in age,” and she says, “I know 
what’s getting ready to happen.” She says, “It’s not going to happen to 
me.” She got out of the circus. She always had that feather in her hat. 
She always said, “That’s my feather in the hat because I was center ring 
from the day I went in until the day I retired.” It was real important to 
her. She was very, very talented. 
 
How old would she have been? 
 
She was born in 1916 and I’ll let you do the math. Well, she retired at 54 
so what are we looking at there, twenty or thirty years? Thirty years, 
something like that. 
 
’26, ’36, ’46, ’56… 
 
So it would’ve been… 
 
…almost fifty years—or almost forty-five years, something like that.

But yes, she just made a point that she didn’t want [to be moved to the 
side ring]. She saw too many of them end up like that. She says, “That’s 
not for me.” 
 
Your family name, when people hear it, automatically images pop in 
their heads of the history. I really want you to tell me about your 
family’s circus tradition, because it goes back many generations. 
 
I’m what—seventh generation? We’re seventh generation. My 
children—oh, no! Am I seventh? 
 
I would say we are the sixth generation, your son’s seventh, and your 
grandchildren are the eighth. 
 
…eighth generation. 
 
How did your family get involved with the circus business? 
 
Well, we did a little research. Well, we didn’t. Back in Napoleon’s time, 
the Loyal family is like Smith. There are a lot of Smiths everywhere. 
Okay, the revolution broke out. Well, the Loyals kind of scattered, I 
guess. A bunch of them went to Germany, some went somewhere else to 
Italy and some stayed in France. Ours stayed in France and he used to 
break horses for Napoleon’s army and at the end of each—conquest, 
would you say? When they would conquer something, then he would 
give grants to his soldiers, where they would want land or whatever. But 
ours didn’t want that. Ours wanted canvas, as much canvas as he could 
get, like those tents that they used to make. Our family used to have one 
pole and they had a ring. They would work out in the street with their 
horse act. They would get—was it like contributions? Where they would 
donate… 
 
Donations. 
 
Donations. Well, then when he worked for Napoleon. I guess worked for 
Napoleon—that’s what he wanted, he wanted canvas. So they made their 
first tent and that’s how the Loyal family got started doing the bareback 
riding. 
 
Then the Travaglia family, which is going to be our grandmother’s 
side… 
 
On our grandmother’s side. 
 
They had a circus in Italy for years, years, and years.

…years and years. 
 
We can’t even tell you how far back that goes, because we don’t know. 
There’s no one alive to tell us. But my grandfather ended up marrying 
my grandmother. You saw how that came about. It was an arranged 
marriage because they were both quite talented with horses and doing 
circus. He really wasn’t in love with our grandmother. He was in love 
with her sister. But because she was so talented and he was so talented, 
the family thought, financially, that was the smartest move. It didn’t 
matter what they liked so that’s how they got together. In 1932, they 
came to the United States with Ringling Brothers, and they went back. 
They went back to Europe, but then the war broke out. When that 
happened, they came back and they stayed permanently. 
 
I’m going to bust in there real quick. The first time they came was 1929. 
 
’32 is when they came and stayed. You’re right, I got it wrong. 
 
They came in 1929. Then they went back to Italy. Then they came back 
in ’32, and that’s when they stayed here, in ’32. 
 
That’s correct. 
 
Then the war broke out. What’s so funny is my mother’s uncle, his name 
was Aldemaro. We called him Zio [Uncle] Tattu or Zio [Uncle] Chanto. 
He wasn’t from show business, and he winded up marrying my father’s 
and her [Dolly’s] mother’s sister. Then when my mother married my 
father, it made double cousins and aunts. 
 
We used to joke around and say, “Well, you’re your own grandfather.” 
(Laughter) We can’t piece that together. There’s really no relationship 
there, but there is. 
 
And that’s like Adriano “Nucci” [Catarzi] that made the disks. That 
would be his first cousin, but yet, it would be his aunt. So it’s really, “Uh 
oh, that doesn’t sound too good,” but pretty much all the families are 
real tight. Even though we don’t live close to each other, we are a real 
tight family. That’s the way it has always been through the generations 
in Europe, with all of us. 
 
How did your parents learn what they learned about the circus? 
 
Our grandfather taught his children. And then when they had us, he 
taught us. Let me tell you what, it wasn’t a fun experience, because we 
would go to school all day long. Our parents insisted that we got an

education because they weren’t afforded that opportunity. We would go 
to school all day, and when we got home we practiced every single day. 
Sometimes we didn’t practice on Sunday and that was only because he 
didn’t want to. He would be tired or whatever. But we practiced every 
day. It was like we went to school and then we went to school. He was 
very, very strict with us. 
 
There would be tricks that he would invent on his own.  
 
He came up with a one-man flying act that I did, one person. He rigged 
this thing up—I’ve got pictures of it, I’ll show them to you later—and he 
wanted to take me to Europe with that, but my mother told  him, “If 
you’re going to take my daughter to Europe it will be in the 
summertime.” He said, “Well, she doesn’t need to go to school. She’s 
going to make a living doing that.” She said, “No, Dad. She’s going to 
go to school. If you want to take her in the summertime when school’s 
out, you can do that.” Of course, they argued back and forth about that, 
but Mom just kept her foot down about that.  
 
But back to that flying act. You would take a web, which is a long rope-
looking thing. You would go up to this bar, trapeze, you would reach up 
above the trapeze, you would stand on that and then you would work 
your way up. He had these straps that made loops. You would put your 
feet in these straps and go across those straps to this other bar… 
 
Upside down. 
 
…upside down. My cousin used to say, “How are we supposed to get 
from that bar to the other one?” and in Italian, you would say, “Come 
una mosca.” That means, “Like a fly.” You would have to go across 
these straps to get to this other bar. Then you would hang from that, he 
would bring a trapeze up to you, you would swing, you’d do the trick, 
and you would catch the other bar. You didn’t need a catcher. You were 
a one-man flying act, and he had me doing this crazy act. 
 
I’m just a few years younger than Dolly, not much. (Laughter) But I 
remember. In fact, she had forgotten all about that trapeze. 
 
I had forgotten what happened to the bar, yes. 
 
And I said, “Oh, you know Dolly,” I said, “I was going to get this bar 
one day, over at the old winter quarters in Sarasota,” our winter quarters. 
I said, “I saw it leaning up against this thing,” and I said, “I remember 
this trapeze that used to hang up in the backyard.” It’s like a square and 
it had one trapeze at one end and one at the other, and I said, “I 
remember you practicing on it. You would be on this and you would do

like a forward somersault.” The two bars would meet and she’d be on 
one end and I said, “You’d do a forward somersault,” and she would 
literally catch by her heels on the other trapeze. And she’s only like six, 
seven, eight years old. I was a lot smaller, but I remember her practicing. 
I would be down there practicing, or she would be practicing. I’d be 
watching. Dolly and them were more the aerial-type people… 
 
Yes, I never did care for the horses... 
 
…and I’m strictly horses. I don’t know if I got it from my father and 
grandfather… 
 
You got it on the Loyal side, period. They’re all horse people. 
 
…but the horses, those are the most beautiful animals God ever put on 
this earth, are horses. I eat, sleep, and drink horses. 
 
That’s true. 
 
And I still go out right now. In fact, I was up real early this morning 
taking care of horses. 
 
What acts were your families known for in those early years? When 
you’re growing up, what are your parents doing? 
 
Oh, gosh! They did everything. They were known, though, as bareback 
riders, as equestrians, but they did everything. Like my uncle Joe 
[Galasso], he was hand balancing, handstands, and my aunt’s husband, 
Zio Tattu [Aldemaro Catarzi], he was teeter board. I mean, they all had 
their—how would you say it? 
 
They all had their specialties… 
 
Specialties. 
 
…but they were all versatile. They could walk in there and they could be 
a one-family circus. They could. They could be a one-family circus. 
They could tumble, they could fly, they did wire walking, they did 
horses, they did the cannon, they did cloud swing, they…

If it was done, they did it. 
 
Yes. 
 
And so that’s what I’m saying. The family was big… 
 
High wire… 
 
…and they could actually have done a complete circus. Of course, you 
got tired of looking at the same ones over and over again, but they 
could’ve done it. 
 
I could see how that could be very attractive. 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
The tricks that my uncles and my aunts did, very few others ever 
accomplished. There were tricks that many of them never even 
attempted to do. And they’ve never done it since. They’ve never done it 
since. My uncle Giustino [Loyal], he did somersault from the first horse 
to the fourth horse in Madison Square Garden. And it was just to 
show—there used to be, among the circus performers, a lot of rivalry. Is 
that the word? 
 
That’s correct. 
 
Competition. 
 
Rivalry is a good word for it. 
 
Competition and rivalry about, “Okay, so he did somersault from horse 
to horse. Oh, well, he did it from the first horse to the third horse.” So 
when they went to Madison Square Garden, there were two other riding 
acts there. There was Cristiani’s and I believe, if I’m not wrong, [Edwin] 
“Poodles” Hanneford’s. 
 
Yes, Hannefords. 
 
Hannefords. And so they put the Loyal-Repenskys in the center, because 
the Hannefords were doing it from the first horse to the second horse and 
Cristianis from the first horse to the third horse. Well, my uncle Giustino 
[Loyal] wasn’t going to let anybody get away with that so he put a 
fourth horse in there. 
 
Now, you’ve got to understand the horses were not back to back, like 
you see them when they do from horse to horse, because it would’ve

filled the ring up. So they had them angled. 
 
What they would do, too, is like, say your fourth horse—they’d be all in 
line, but when he got ready to throw his somersault, there’d be a 
command my grandfather or my uncle would say or do to them. And the 
one horse, instead of this it would be one of the two horses that are 
directly—because he’s going to go from the first horse to the fourth 
horse. This number three horse would pull up beside it so, actually, he’s 
doing it from the first horse to the third horse because that fourth horse 
pulled up. Then he just drops back a little bit. 
 
Then my mom, she did somersaults from horse to horse. She did just 
about anything that any of the men did as far as horseback riding went. 
 
She did somersaults through hoops… 
 
Through hoops... 
 
…through two hoops at the same time. They’d be holding a big hoop 
and she’d do it through the little hoop and go through the big hoop. She 
did it over banners, one right after the other—doon, doon, doon, doon, 
doon! 
 
Then two of my aunts, [Claudia] Esterina [Galasso] and Germana [Loyal 
Zacchini], they followed in our grandparents’ footsteps as far as the part 
of the act that they did. And what is it called? 
 
It’s called the pas de deux. 
 
The pas de deux, and the one we were talking about, Germana, she was 
always what they called the porture, which is the one on the bottom. She 
was the heavy, as far as muscles and stuff went. They would do a 
balancing, head balancing with the horses moving. 
 
She… 
 
No hands. 
 
My aunt… 
 
They were so quick. 
 
My aunt Germana would hold my aunt Esterina and go head to head, no 
hands, stand on their heads, no hands, handstand, hand to hand… 
 
My aunt Germana fell in love with my uncle, who had the cannon act,

the Zacchinis. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of that, but they were 
very famous. The problem with that was my grandfather blew a fuse 
because that was a big part of the act. He didn’t want to lose her so they 
snuck off and got married. When they got back and she finally told my 
grandfather, her wedding present was a slap (laughs) because she 
disobeyed him. They eloped and everything. 
 
Yes, and they weren’t allowed to… 
 
They didn’t have any type of marital life until after the season was over. 
 
Yes, there was no honeymoon. There was nothing. 
 
And it’s because of the fear of maybe her conceiving a child or 
something like that. They had a contract. They were married, but they 
weren’t “married” until the end of the season. But he was really, really 
bad news when it came to the girls getting married, because he needed 
every one of them for that act. They all were special in their own way. 
And it took away from the act when they would get married and leave 
with their husbands. 
 
When my father—when my mother, I should say, came to the United 
States in 1948 or ’47, and landed in Baltimore, it was going into the 
night performance. She had never been to a circus in her life, I don’t 
guess. They picked her up at the airport, whoever, it wasn’t anybody in 
the family. They sent somebody to pick her up. When she got there, they 
took her straight to the dressing room and they plucked her eyebrows 
and put a costume on her and… 
 
Can you imagine? (Laughs) 
 
…put makeup. My mother didn’t even know what makeup was! 
(Laughter) 
 
…and send her out there! (Laughs) 
 
Putting high heels on her and they all marched in, like you saw on that 
tape where they all marched in. Well, low and behold, they have a big 
cape on her and a headpiece and these high heels. (Laughter) They said, 
“Just landed from sunny Italy, another Loyal-Repensky sister!” She 
came wobbling out and falls down! (Laughter) Then, the next morning, 
at five o’clock in the morning, my grandfather had her in the ring 
practicing. 
 
How to walk in heels, for starters! (Laughs)

She was ready to go back to Italy! (Laughs) Since her and my dad had 
been writing each other and they fell in love through letters and mail, 
when it was time for them to get married, my father was thirty-two and 
he had to go ask his oldest sister, Albertina [Loyal Catarzi]—get 
permission to marry my mother. And she said no so he went to his 
father. My grandfather told him, “What did Albertina say?” He said, 
“Albertina said no.” He said, “Then it’s no.” So a few days later he 
snatched her up, they took off, eloped, and went to Chicago and got 
married in Chicago. 
 
Oh, I didn’t know they married in Chicago. 
 
Yes, they took off and got married in Chicago. 
 
Well, tell them a little bit about you. 
 
Well, actually, before we go into that, you’re growing up in … 
 
Sarasota. 
 
…what is your—both of you, I want you to tell me your earliest circus 
memory. 
 
Of working in the circus or practicing? 
 
Just in general. Like, the earliest circus memory. When you finally get a 
grasp that this… 
 
I’m going to try. I think I’m going to be about four years old. I’m going 
to say about four years old and it was Polack Brothers. I remember Jack 
Leontini, and we were practicing a dog act. Somebody had a dog act. 
Who had a dog act? Zio Tattu had a dog act! 
 
Yes. 
 
And they were practicing the dog act. That is one of my earliest 
memories of practicing. 
 
My earliest memories were the winter quarters, the Ringling Brothers 
winter quarters. 
 
I was a little older than that. 
 
They were out there practicing. I remember—I don’t know why I 
remember this. It might be something I was told, but this is what I 
remember. They were out there practicing and I remember running out

to the ring. Everybody was hollering at me because I was little, and they 
were afraid the horses were going to run over me. I was trying to go to 
where my mother was. My grandfather had a whip and he was hitting 
those horses, because he was afraid I was going to get trampled by the 
horses. That’s a terrible memory! But that’s my earliest memory, was 
the fear of the horses. And I never did like the horses. 
 
Oh, I loved the horses. 
 
I liked the horses. I didn’t want any part of doing the horses. 
 
I hated practicing the trapeze. (Laughter) My grandfather had a trapeze. 
My grandfather’s house sat over here. (Gestures) It looked like an old, 
medieval castle. That’s what I always thought of that place, a medieval 
castle. 
 
It kind of looked that way, yes. 
 
And he had this fountain and then there was like a row of trees and some 
bushes and then there was my aunt Albertina’s house. Well, right there 
they would set up these little upright bars where the trapeze would hang 
on that upright. 
 
Yes. 
 
And he would get Dolly and Olympia [Zacchini]—and I was real little—
and me, and we would practice. Well, she was already great, but I hated 
it. And he used to spank me. Dolly knows about the spankings. He used 
to spank me. But I hated trapeze. I hated it! And I hated tumbling. And 
I’ll tell you another thing my grandfather used to make us do. Back in 
those days when you were a performer, you had to be able to do 
everything. You had to be able to act, you had to be able to play an 
instrument. You had to be able to do all of that. My grandfather, every 
day, after we practiced, we would have to go in the house with my aunt 
Albertina, and we would have to sit there and I had to learn how to play 
a violin.  (Laughs) Dolly… 
 
I had a saxophone. (Laughter) And we were so bad. And Nucci had the 
violin.  
 
Nucci had a violin and I had a violin. 
 
I don’t know how my grandmother stood the noise! (Laughs) 
 
Each one of the cousins had to play an instrument. I think Remo [Loyal] 
did the trumpet.

Gus [Giustino Loyal, Jr.] did the trumpet. 
 
Somebody had a trumpet… 
 
Gus did the trumpet. Remo had a sax too, but let me tell you a story 
about the saxophone. It was called a soprano saxophone. It was about 
this tall. (Gestures) It was really a short sax. There was always a method 
to my grandfather’s madness. He wanted me to learn how to play that 
thing while I was doing tricks on the trampoline. (Laughter) And I was 
supposed to play this stupid song. I’d have a busted lip all the time! I’m 
doing the trick and it’s going down my throat! (Laughs) I could not wait 
to get rid of that saxophone! 
 
My grandfather came up with some real unusual… (Laughs) 
 
He got a bear one time, a black bear. The name of that bear was Martan, 
which is Martin in English. He got it when it was like this, little bitty 
cub. Oh, cute cub! And he kept it down there at the Ringling Brothers’ 
winter quarters. Every day we’d go down there, clean out the cage, and 
feed the bear. The problem was the bear started growing. He was getting 
big! (Laughter) He got to looking at us like lunch! (Laughs) We went 
down there one day and my grandfather had these whips and he called 
them Vitamin A, B, and C. You never wanted to get to A, for some 
reason. In school that was good, but with him that was not good, A is not 
good. When we were practicing he would use those whips. 
 
Yes, he was like… 
 
But, here is this bear and this day we walked down there and me and 
Adriano, the one that made the video, he says, “Go in there, clean the 
cage, and feed the bear.” I said, “I’m not going in there.” He said, “Go in 
there”—in Italian he was telling me, “Go in there, clean the cage, and 
feed the bear.” “I’m not going in there.” He says, “I’m going to go get 
Vitamin C.” I said, “I don’t care if you bring A, B, and C! I’m not going 
back in that cage!” (Laughs) I never did go back in that cage. 
 
And that bear never did ride the horse. 
 
And that bear turned out mean. Oh! He was going to raise it up to ride 
on the horse, this bear on the horse. I don’t know if he was going to put 
one of us on top of the bear or what! We never got that far. (Laughter) 
 
My one cousin—and he’ll tell you, Gus—my grandfather wasn’t a very 
patient man and when you went to practice or learn something and he’d 
tell you to do it, he expected you to do right then. There was no learning

time. He told you to do it and you had to do it! And he expected it to be 
right. How can you do something you’ve never done before? 
 
He had the two cousins that she was talking about do a tumbling act. In 
this act, my older of the two cousins was supposed to throw Remo up in 
the air, his brother, get down on his knees, and Remo was supposed to 
land on his back, on his back, back to back. They practiced and they 
practiced and they practiced. It was impossible to do it! 
 
My cousin—Giustino is his name, but we call him Gus, Bebito—and he 
would take my cousin Remo… 
 
Throw him up… 
 
…and he’d have to throw him up in the air… 
 
…and get down. 
 
…and he would have to bend over. Well, while he’s bending over, Remo 
has to be doing a somersault… 
 
…and land on his back. 
 
…and land on his back, back to back. 
 
…back to back. 
 
Well, they never did it! They never could do it! Then when my 
grandfather got through with them, then my uncle Giustino started in on 
them. 
 
Well, Remo got to where he was calling in sick a lot. (Laughs) He was 
the one that got all the spankings, because Gus was doing his part. He 
was the bottom man. He’d get down and his part wasn’t the hard part. 
Remo’s part, to land on his back, was hard. So he was always—you 
know, he was sick a lot. (Laughs) 
 
My aunt Albertina, who you saw doing the incline on the wire, taught 
my cousin Remo to do a wire act. He was fantastic. There’s nobody, 
nobody—there was a famous wire walker called… 
 
Concolino. 
 
…Concolino. My cousin surpassed Concolino in wires. I feel real bad 
that I don’t have a photo to show you of him doing somersaults, one 
right after the other on the wire.

Una plancha—I don’t know how to say plancha in English. 
 
It’s lay out. 
 
A flat lay out. It’s a flat, straight… 
 
Instead of tucking for a somersault… 
 
You’re straight out. It’s absolutely gorgeous. You see the wire. You can 
see him and he’s straight up and down with his feet and his head down, 
going into—he was fantastic! He was fantastic. But he didn’t like circus. 
 
When you were younger did you have a choice as to… 
 
No. 
 
You’re like, for nothing!  (Laughter) …as to what you wanted to do. You 
didn’t want to really work with horses… 
 
Yes, they tried me on the horses. They tried me on the horses and I could 
stand up, and I could kneel, and I could do a few things like that, but 
they could see I wasn’t cut out for that. I always was trying to go swing 
on things so that’s where the trapeze came in. 
 
And see, I was the opposite. 
 
But you had to do something. There wasn’t any… 
 
I didn’t like the trapeze. I just didn’t—and I hated the flying act. I would 
never let go, is what my problem was. I’m not going to let go, they’re 
nuts! I’m perfectly fine holding on. (Laughs) See, I wouldn’t let go. 
 
She was down in Jacksonville. I was already up in my thirties when this

And I’ll tell you exactly. It was Alfredo and Morales’s flying act.

then. So I go home and I go to bed, and the next morning I crawled to 
the bathroom. (Laughter) There wasn’t anything that didn’t hurt!

I was like, “Oh, my, just let me get there! (Laughter) I’m going, “I’m too

But you remembered how to do it, though. 
 
Yes, like I said, you don’t ever forget.

It’s like riding a bicycle. You don’t forget. Now, mentally I can still do 
it. 
 
Like Dolly will tell you, she can do all of those tricks in her mind. 
 
Yes. 
 
Where were your parents while your grandfather was… 
 
On the road with the circus. 
 
They were working. 
 
We would stay home with our grandmother [Josephina Estella Travaglia 
Loyal] and grandfather [Jules Loyal]… 
 
And we would go to school… 
 
…because they insisted we go to school. As soon as school let out—
back then it let out in June—they put us immediately on a plane and sent 
us to where they were at. Sometimes we actually worked. I worked a 
little bit with Ringling. 
 
I didn’t start working until 1956, ’57. 
 
So your early years you were going to school just like regular kids. Are 
you in Sarasota, I take it?

But see, we moved to Oklahoma—well, we didn’t move—we were 
traveling on a small circus called Benson Brothers or Kelly Morris at the 
time, and they’re out of Gibsonton, Florida. I don’t know where we went 
to visit Al G. Kelly Miller. I remember them announcing that we were 
there visiting and my dad and my mother stood up, and we waved, and 
we sat back down. Mr. Miller had made arrangements with my dad for 
us to come on their show, which was based here in Hugo, Oklahoma, the 
original Al G. Kelly Miller Circus. So we moved to Hugo. We came to 
Hugo in the winter of 1955 to open in March of ’56. I hadn’t been 
practicing that long with my grandfather, because I was born in ’49. My 
grandfather passed away in ’56 and we had to leave the show. I 
remember us leaving the show in October to go to Florida when my 
grandfather passed away. 
 
But then my mother worked with Kelly Miller some, too. Different ones 
did. 
 
Yes. We were looking at those pictures and there was Lilly Stropitov. 
You said, “What’s her name?” I said, “Oh, that’s Lilly Stropitov. I don’t 
remember her looking like that,” because I remember her in later years. 
But yes, your mom and them had all come to work on that Kelly Miller 
Circus, on Al G. Kelly Miller. That’s when our uncle Giustino was 
supposed to give your mother Vroka, her horse, which he didn’t. He sent 
Cincinnati instead. 
 
Cincinnati was getting up in age, too. 
 
And I learned to ride on this horse called Cincinnati. He belonged to the 
family way back when. When that horse died, he was thirty-two years 
old. But I learned to ride on Cincinnati. He was a golden Palomino 
Belgian. Papa would try to retire him, because by then we had younger 
horses. He would get loose off the truck and he would come running into 
the tent, this poor, old horse, and he would get right in his place. He was 
always the second to the last horse. 
 
I didn’t know he did that. 
 
Oh, yes. Cincinnati would get loose, and he’d come in and he’d get 
between Dolly and Chulo every time. 
 
Dolly the horse. (Laughs)

Yes, we named a horse Dolly. 
 
I really need to clarify that. (Laughter) 
 
The very first horse I had was named Ginger. Here, I’m like five or six 
years old when we got Ginger. But then when we came to Al G. Kelly 
Miller, Papa bought horses. One was named Pat and Dolly; we named 
her after you… 
 
Thank you. 
 
…and we had our very first, Chulo. Well, I had Cincinnati and 
Cincinnati would get loose and he’d always come in and go right 
between those two horses, and Papa couldn’t get him out. We had to 
finish the act. 
 
Her father was such a fantastic horse trainer. He was very good, 
patience. 
 
My dad wasn’t known for being a—I mean, he was a rider. He was an 
average rider. He was good, but he wasn’t anything like my uncle 
Giustino or my aunt Zefta. But what he lacked in being a bareback rider, 
he made up for training the horses. My uncles and my aunts will all tell 
you, the horses that my grandfather and my father put out, nobody else 
ever… 
 
And not only that, Lucy, they had no act without the horses. 
 
Well, that’s true. 
 
You had to have that so his part was so terribly important. 
 
I was telling you about the somersault from the first horse to the fourth 
horse, the horse that threw my uncle, my grandfather and my father 
taught him. All they had to do was like tap him in a certain place or step 
in a certain place on him and the horse automatically knew to give them 
that extra buck to throw them up. In fact, there is a picture that you 
have—it was on that thing—of your mother doing the somersault and 
you can see where the horse is… 
 
You can actually see where… 
 
…where she’s throwing… 
 
It’s kind of like giving her a boost.

…where she’s giving her the boost, because there’s a certain way that 
she can touch her or whatever and that horse would give her that boost. 
 
Well, what goes into training a horse? 
 
Patience. 
 
You need to talk to her about that. 
 
A lot of patience and it’s consistency. Is that how you say that? 
Consistency? 
 
Yes. 
 
Doing the same thing over and over and over. You don’t beat them, you 
don’t hit them, you don’t smack them in the face. That’s where a lot of 
people get the wrong conception—it’s treats. When they do something 
good—okay, you teach them—this is the way I was taught. Okay, you 
want them to learn to run the ring. First, I walk them around the ring 
several times a week, whatever, so they know… 
 
Repetition. 
 
…the outlay of the ring and whatever, that they know that’s what they 
have to do. Then, you trot them a little bit so they don’t get dizzy. 
Horses are like people, you run in a circle you’re going to get dizzy. 
They’ve got to learn to run a little bit, stop, maybe one round, stop, run 
around, stop. When they get that, then you add another round, then you 
add another round, and then eventually, they’re not getting dizzy and 
neither are you, because you stand there and go like that too, you get 
dizzy. So they get it and then they go around maybe four, five, six times, 
and then you stop them so that gives them time. Then after awhile, it 
doesn’t bother them anymore.  
 
But it’s consistency. Whenever they learned and we’d stop them, 
“Bravo, good boy,” and you pet him and you give him little sugar cubes. 
Or now they have treats for horses so I just go down and buy the treats 
because [with sugar cubes] they slobber all over your hand and get it all 
sticky! (Laughs) Those treats are a lot easier. They’re not all sticky! But 
when we used to practice and stuff, I would always go so I could steal 
those sugar cubes. I’d be sitting there, “Can I have one?” (Laughs) 
 
You were eating the horses’ treats?! 
 
Yes! I used to like the sugar cubes. (Laughter) I’d just go over to 
practice just so I could have sugar cubes.

I didn’t know you did that! (Laughs) 
 
Sure did! But it’s just consistency and patience, a lot of patience with the 
animals. That’s pretty much all animals.  It’s like everything, you always 
get one rotten apple somewhere along the way and it spoils it for 
everybody else. But no, I tell you something, my grandfather and my 
father and I were taught this—we take so good care of our horses. 
They’re the ones that put the bread and butter on the table. You have to 
take care of them. They are the ones that make your living. Without 
those animals, you have nothing. You can walk to a coke machine. You 
can walk to the water spigot or your water fountain or whatever and get 
a drink of water or go make you a sandwich, but those horses don’t. 
They depend on you. All animals depend on you, the elephants, the 
lions, the tigers, the dogs, the ponies—they depend on you to take care 
of them.  
 
Before any of us, especially with my father, our horses ate before we ate. 
A horse got taken care of before we got taken care of, always. That was 
instilled in us ever since that—well, with me because I did the horses, 
but instilled, I think, in pretty much all my cousins, that the animals 
were first and pretty much everybody in show business that has animals. 
You have to take care of them first because they depend on you. They’re 
like part of the family. I was sitting here and I was telling Dolly, “Oh, 
yes I remember this horse.” She said, “Well, how do you remember?” I 
guess from being around my father. She says, “Oh, Manalique, I don’t 
remember that.” “Oh, I remember Manalique!” And I remember 
Palermo. 
 
I remember the names on some of them. 
 
I remember New York. 
 
I remember them. 
 
And I remember Cincinnati. I remember the name Vroka, but I don’t 
remember Vroka. 
 
I remember Vroka. 
 
They had a horse called Marna, and she never remembers Marna. She 
was a white horse. 
 
But you were more into the horses. 
 
That’s true.

How were names decided? 
 
On the horses? 
 
Yes. 
 
Here’s what I think. I honestly believe it’s where they got the horse. One 
of them was named New York—think about it—one of them was named 
Cincinnati. One of them was named—there was another one named after 
a town. I don’t remember what it was. But I think that they didn’t know 
what else to call them so they named them after… 
 
Oh, there was Cipolla! Do you remember Cipolla? 
 
I remember Cipolla. But the rest of the names, I don’t know how they 
came up with those names. 
 
And cipolla is onion. 
 
Why would they name him Cipolla? 
 
Was it white? (Laughter) 
 
Yes, my horses. 
 
And why was that one named Dolly?! (Laughter) 
 
Papa named her Dolly. I don’t know why he named her Dolly. Then 
another one, his name was some other name and he was so pretty that 
they called him Chulo, which means beautiful in Spanish. Que chulo, 
que chulo, so they named him Chulo. Then I got some Belgian horses 
back in, oh, I want to say late-’80s. Somewhere in the ’80s and wait till I 
tell you their names. One was named Alexander McKeag. The other one 
was named Pasquinel. The other one was named Clay Basket and one… 
 
I don’t even want to know! How’d you know about those names—I do 
want to know! 
 
The other one was named Seccombe. I’m so into that Centennial, that 
miniseries, Centennial. Have you ever seen that miniseries, Centennial? 
I was into that miniseries, Centennial, and it’s about a French—how 
weird—a French, oh, what do you call them? A trapper, a French 
trapper, a Canadian-French trapper that came to the United States back 
in the cowboy days. He’s the mountain man, and these were characters 
out of that movie, and his name was Pasquinel. Oh, and then I had

another one name Jake, Jake Pasquinel, that was the son. Then I had 
Mikey, well that was the other son. (Laughter) 
 
Were you raised in a bilingual household? 
 
Yes. 
 
Yes. 
 
In fact, when I first started school, I did not speak English. I spoke 
Italian. I understood it, but we didn’t speak it, because my grandmother 
and grandfather didn’t speak English. So we didn’t speak a lot of 
English. 
 
My grandmother, till the day she died, I think she only knew maybe five 
words in English, hello… 
 
She’d say, “Come here,” when she wanted you to leave and, “Go away,” 
when she wanted you to come here. (Laughs) She knew a few words, not 
many. 
 
Yes, none of them spoke any English. 
 
In fact, my grandfather never spoke English. He spoke Italian and when 
he’d get mad, he’d speak French because he’s French. We were talking 
about that yesterday. Why did we speak Italian instead of French? 
Because they were both French nationals, but my grandmother was 
Italian. The last name Travaglia, that’s Italian. That’s not French. She 
spoke more Italian than she did French. 
 
But I think when they went to Italy, because when they were with the 
Travaglia, which was in Italy, the Travaglia side of the family, because 
where they did the high wire and everything it was all in Italy. 
 
It was because the Travaglia circus was in Italy. 
 
Then my father was born in Italy. 
 
My mother was born in Sicily. 
 
So they pretty much left France and went to Italy, I think, because of the 
circuses. I’m not real sure. 
 
How old were each of you when your grandfather passed away? 
 
He passed away in ’56 so I was twelve when he passed away. And

you’re five years younger than I am so that would’ve made you about 
seven. 
 
Who took over his role? 
 
My uncle and my aunt Albertina took over the role and that’s when, a 
little bit later on, the family kind of went their separate ways. 
 
Yes, I want to say Mom stayed just a couple more years. 
 
I think when they finally dissolved everything was in 1959, and I’m 
going to tell you Zia [Aunt] Albertina, and your mother came to Gil 
Gray in Dallas. It was Papa, Momma, your mother, Zia Albertina, they 
were going to put a riding act together for Gil Gray, and I don’t know 
what happened. 
 
They couldn’t get them all together because my aunt Germana married 
my uncle Bruno [Zacchini] and they had gotten out of the circus. He had 
rides and stuff in the carnival. 
 
And then Zio Giustino went to the Ringling show. 
 
He started his own troupe and he separated. And then my other aunt, 
Esterina, married and they went to New Jersey. So it just… 
 
And then Zia Simona [Loyal Pedrero] was with Zio Eddie [Pedrero]… 
 
So they kind of just—it was time. It really was time. They were getting 
up in age. 
 
The only one, actually, after the family busted up—all of them went into 
carnival business with having rides, dark rides, and glass houses and all 
of that stuff, spook houses and stuff, except for my father. My father 
stayed true to his… 
 
His heritage. 
 
…his heritage in the circus. 
 
Now, my uncle Giustino, in a way, did stay. 
 
Yes, he did, because of my cousin. 
 
He did that, but he also was going up to Sailor Circus, and he was 
helping train those kids.

No, no, and I forgot, not only that, he was ringmaster on the Ringling 
Circus. 
 
He did that. 
 
And he was an equestrian director, in fact. 
 
Right. But he stayed active with Sailor Circus. He would go and they 
would call him Papa. 
 
Papa Loyal. 
 
Papa Loyal and he’d go up there and he’d help train all those kids at the 
high school. He did that up until he got to where he was unable to do 
anything like that anymore. 
 
Yes, he got Alzheimer’s and he couldn’t do that anymore. But they 
loved him dearly, they really did, up at Sailor Circus. My cousin Timi—
I forgot. I’m sorry, I left him out. Timi finished high school and he went 
to Sailor Circus and everything, but Timi had the blood in him to be a 
bareback rider. Let me tell you, he is as good as my uncle. 
 
The only one out of his four children, out of Giustino’s four children, 
that, as far as I know, didn’t do anything with circus was Danny. Gus 
did… 
 
Danny didn’t do anything. 
 
…he did horseback riding, Remo did wire, and Timi did horseback 
riding. 
 
No, Danny didn’t do anything. Then Timi, of course, right now he’s 
somewhere in—where’d Armando say they were? In New Hampshire 
and when I talked to him earlier he said, “Oh, I passed Timi yesterday. 
They were in Massachusetts.  They were setting up in Massachusetts. I 
couldn’t stop. All I did was drive by, but I saw the truck and the trailer 
and stuff with the horses.” 
 
I think what’s impressive about all of this is the fact that you go back 
eight generations and there’s still some family still doing circus. That’s a 
long, long time. My cousin, Timi, is training his daughter. She’s [Lucy] 
got her kids doing it, and her kids have got their kids doing it. 
 
My grandkids. 
 
That’s a long time.

I told you the story about my aunt Zefta and my aunt Esterina and my 
aunt Albertina getting a little ticked off at me because my last daughter, 
Tina, was supposed to be named after one of the aunts. They got into a 
squabble over which name. 
 
Well, it’s all your fault. If you’d had seven like you intended to, you’d 
have had a name for every one of them. (Laughter) 
 
I know! (Laughter) Anyway, my son, when he had his first son and he’s 
named after my father. His name is—well, my father’s name isn’t 
Christian, but his name is Alfonso. Christian’s name is Alfonso Joseph 
after my father and my brother who passed away. Then their second 
child was a little girl, and they promised if it was a girl, her name would 
be Zefta. So my aunt Zefta was here for the birth and everything, and 
she was so happy that there was a Zefta after—well, her name is Zefta. 
 
Well, she couldn’t count on me, because I had all boys. I was a big 
disappointment to her! (Laughs) 
 
So we had a Zefta and boy, she was the happiest thing. Now, my aunt 
Zefta’s youngest daughter, Gina [Bowman Priddy], her son got married 
and we finally have a little Zefta, another little Zefta. My daughter, 
Mona, we call her Mona—her name is Simona after my aunt, the 
youngest aunt that passed away. Her too, for a long time I named her 
after her and finally, one of her daughters, they named their daughter 
Simona. 
 
Yes, the youngest one, Monique. 
 
Monique named her daughter Simona. Of course, I have Josie. Her name 
is Germana, but we call her Josie, but she’s named after my aunt 
Germana. She’s kind of built like my aunt Germana, too. Too bad she 
didn’t have the sense my aunt Germana had! (Laughs) 
 
I haven’t seen Josie in a long time. 
 
She looks just like Zia [Germana]. Just like Zia. 
 
I was a kid the last time I saw her. 
 
What’s funny is, when we went to Florida, they have this thing that they 
call…I can’t say it. 
 
Saint Armand’s Circle.

Explain to them what it is, Dolly. 
 
It’s in Sarasota, Florida, and it’s on the way out to Lido Beach, and it’s 
called Saint Armand’s Circle because it is a circle. They’ve got little 
stores and shops all around this circle. It’s a big tourist attraction area. In 
the center of that, it’s like a small park. It has got benches and things like 
that. All the way around that thing, they have different circus 
performers. They’ve got plaques that are in the ground. They are round, 
they’re not square like a plaque, but they’re round and they have their 
dates and what they did and so forth. Our family is in that Saint 
Armand’s Circle. 
 
Every year they can… 
 
Every year they put a new circus family or performer in that circle. It’s 
really kind of a neat thing. 
 
We went down for that and of course, my youngest daughter, Tina, was 
little. She was, I want to say maybe five, and she remembers her aunt 
Germana and she says, “All I can remember is that she wouldn’t call me 
my name. She would always call me Piccinina. ‘Piccinina! Piccinina!’”  
This is Fegan, I’m Cesa! (Laughs) That’s the names our aunts used to 
call us all the time.  
 
But circus is in our blood, actually. We were talking about the new 
generation and everything. Now, my granddaughter Zefta, she stands—
I’m going to send that DVD with you and you can see her standing, 
practicing, and learning to ride, which she rode when she was little until 
she was about maybe four or five years old and then she didn’t ride 
anymore. She was strictly in school and that was pretty much it. She 
started practicing again, I want to say a couple of years ago, and she’s 
doing really, really, really, really good. They’re all practicing. All my 
grandkids are pretty much practicing. They love the circus. In fact, I 
think Zefta left yesterday. Zefta and Renzo left yesterday for Kelly 
Miller to be with Armando on the show. 
 
No Vitamin A, B, and C? 
 
Oh. (Laughter) That stuck with you, did it not? It stuck to me a lot, too! 
 
There’s a little bit of Vitamin A, B, and C. That was so funny because 
on that DVD my cousin made for us, none of us talked about what we 
were going to say or anything. They just came in and they said, “Oh, 
Nucci’s going to do a DVD out there. He wants to interview you. Would 
you go out there and give him an interview?” It’s so funny because 
nobody really paid any attention. Well, everybody was inside and just

one at a time, “Oh, Nucci wants you,” and they’d go out. So when we 
got the DVD and we’re sitting there looking at this DVD and going, 
“Oh, my gosh! He’s talking about A, B, and C! Oh, my God! She’s 
talking about A, B, and C!”  
 
If you look at it, every one of us talked about A, B, and C. (Laughter) 
Well, how could you forget that? That wasn’t a pleasant… 
 
But see, I didn’t say A, B, or C. I said, “I remember a lot of spankings. I 
got a lot of spankings. I got a lot of spankings.” 
 
Well, for your information, it’s A, B, and C! (Laughter) 
 
I said, “Oh, I remember them.” Christian was looking at it, and he had a 
bunch of his high school friends here. They’re looking at it and they’re 
laughing. When it got through with it he says, “What is with you people? 
Everything is an A, B, or C or you’re going to die! (Laughter) You’re 
talking about drowning and the other one’s talking about getting blown 
up.” 
 
In her video, her best memory of the family was when we were in 
Cuba… 
 
With my cousins. 
 
…with your cousins… 
 
I love them! 
 
…and we were hiding under beds because they were bombing in Cuba. 
They were blowing it up. 
 
I remember the revolution! The revolution! 
 
The revolution, that was her best memory. Now, what is it with you? 
(Laughs) 
 
I said, “And it was fun!” To me, it was fun. My grandmother would 
snatch us up and, a bunch of us, she took our clothes and tied us together 
so we wouldn’t get lost. We’d be running down the street and we’re all 
hooked onto each other. They’d hide us under the beds and stuff because 
of the bombs. I remember one of the hotels. Yes, and I said, “That was 
one of my funnest times.” And it is! It was! It was for me. Oh, I had a lot 
of fun with my cousins. I thought it was fun. 
 
Back then, on the circus, too, it was a lot different. Everybody looked

out for everybody’s child. We could go outside and we could play and 
say so and so, Canastrelli’s, who lived over here, their kids were outside 
playing and the Bisbinni’s, they lived over here in their trailer and their 
kids were—everybody watched everybody else’s children. They were 
always supervised. Maybe we weren’t directly, they weren’t directly 
outside standing over them, but we always knew there was always 
somebody watching us. The kids could go outside and play and stuff and 
you didn’t have to worry about anything. Anymore…it’s like I tell my 
daughter Josie, who is on Carson and Barnes, I said, “Josie, watch Maya. 
Josie, watch Juju. Josie, watch—you don’t know who’s out there.” 
Before, you used to know everybody. Anymore, you have no clue. These 
people are coming from different parts of the world and we don’t know. 
Things have changed so much from when we were on the circus. 
 
When we were kids on the circus and we were going back then, the 
Ringling Brothers had the trains. We would have almost a whole train 
for ourselves because we had a big family. Inside the train there would 
be like an isle going up the middle and then there would be what they 
call state rooms. My uncle would have his room and then my mother and 
then through this whole section over here. I remember when we would 
come into town, it was so exciting to see all those people standing out 
there, watching you. We thought we were important. It wasn’t us, but us 
kids liked it. We’d go and stand on the end like, “Here we are!” 
(Laughter) And they weren’t looking at us, they were looking at the 
elephants and the horses, but we thought we were important. (Laughter) 
I used to love that part of it. Just riding the train and going from town to 
town and watching them put the tent up. 
 
When you were growing up did you think, “This is what I want to do, 
too”? 
 
I think I did when I was little, but then it got to be a job, because they 
started working me in the circus when I was like six. They would take 
me out of school and take me to South America and Central America 
and Cuba, and then I have to come home and make that work up at 
school. 
 
We were talking about that this morning. 
 
It got to where I felt like I had to do it. So when I got older, I pulled 
away from it because it was so pushed on me all my life that I wanted to 
run away from it. And I did. I left. 
 
And see, I was the opposite. I hated school. I was telling her this 
morning how I hated school. I don’t know, I was trying to explain to her, 
I said, “Dolly, I hated it. I literally hated it.” I said, “I would be taken out

of school in March. I would come home in November. I would have to 
do all that catching up.” I hated school. It’s not that I was dumb or stupid 
or anything. My mother left me here one year in 1960 with a lady named 
Ruby Doyle. I called her Aunt Ruby and I used to make straight F’s. I’ve 
gone to school with everybody in Hugo, Oklahoma, “Oh, Lucy? Yeah! I 
know her. I went to school with her.” (Laughter) “Oh, yes! I went to 
school with her!” I have class pictures with everybody in Hugo! 
(Laughter) And I love every one of them. 
 
And some of them are nineteen! (Laughter) 
 
I made straight F’s. I did. I made straight F’s. The only thing I made an 
A in was conduct. I could keep my mouth shut. I didn’t know anything 
to say! 
 
I guess that was your second career, right? 
 
Anyway, when I stayed home that year with Ruby, after Mom and them 
left and went on the road, I made straight A’s. I made straight A’s. My 
teacher kept going, “Lucy, how are you—are you cheating?” I’m going, 
“No.” They’d say, “Okay. Well, tell me what this is, what you read, or 
my multiplications and all of that.” It was due to Aunt Ruby because 
Aunt Ruby would make me sit there and apply myself and do my work. 
If I didn’t do it, I didn’t go play. I stayed there until I learned it so I 
made straight A’s.  
 
Well, summer vacation came and I didn’t go on the show. I stayed here 
with Ruby and then school started, I still made straight A’s. Well, 
Momma and Papa came home off the road. Back then, Momma used to 
pay Ruby fifty dollars a month for me to stay there and go to school. 
Well, Aunt Ruby would say, “Well, leave her with me, Lilly, Alfonso. 
You don’t have to pay me. Just so she keeps me company,” because her 
husband got a job in Dallas and he would only come on the weekends. 
Her kids were all grown and out of school. Her youngest one graduated 
the year I stayed with her. And so, of course, me, “No. No.” I wanted to 
be with Mom and, of course, Momma didn’t speak English that well. 
Papa really didn’t go to school. I think he was third grade and that was 
about it. Momma graduated, but it was all in Italy. So they never pressed 
me or made me do my work, and I could care less because I didn’t want 
anything to do with it anyway. I wanted show business and show 
business it was.  
 
I finally quit junior high. I was fifteen years old, just getting ready to go 
into the ninth grade. Here I am going into the ninth grade with eleven 
year olds—I don’t think so! (Laughs) So I quit school and at times, I 
regret it because I didn’t get to get involved in the senior prom, and they

have the high school reunions and things like that, that I think I 
would’ve enjoyed. Now that I’m older, I look back and think, “Oh, well, 
that would’ve been a nice memory.” And do this and do that. When I 
had my kids, I made sure my kids went to school, got an education, and 
got the best of both lives, got the circus. Now, my two oldest ones were 
never going to be in show business and where are they? On the circus. 
They both went to OU. Mona went one day longer than Armando. Josie, 
she didn’t want anything to do with college. Tina graduated and got 
married to a young man in the service and that’s about it, though. 
 
See, my children are just the opposite. I Americanized my children, 
totally. They know about the circus, they know what I did, they see the 
pictures, but they were never involved in it. In fact, two of them have 
businesses, appliance businesses, and my middle boy has a career in the 
navy, but they’re totally out of the circus. Do I have regrets? In a way, I 
do. I wished I had spent a little more time teaching them some of the 
things. But back then, I was really, really pulling away from it.  
 
Now, my grandkids, we push them. We keep them in school. I have two 
that are going to graduate this coming year, but they’re both involved in 
the circus. Christian is absolutely—he wants to go out and buy his own 
horses now and stuff. Kylie, of course, is with her mother. You asked me 
about the costumes. Those are for Kylie’s mother’s mother-in-law’s 
circus. Kylie this year did web in the circus, her first year to do web in 
the circus. Of course, Kylie did hula hoops a couple of times when she 
was little, and she did work in the riding act with me when she was 
smaller. Zefta worked in the riding act, Christian worked in the riding 
act, and Channing? No. Maya? No, not yet.  
 
But my youngest grandson, Argio, who’s the same age as Lexie, about 
three, he’s a clown on Kelly Miller. And a very good little clown at that! 
He loves it. It’s in his blood, I think. All of them, though, practice riding. 
On the DVD I’m going to let you take, you can see them all practicing. 
But it’s like everything, circus has its good times, it has its bad times, it 
has its happy times, it has its sad times. Dolly, she left the circus. I love 
the circus. I couldn’t exist without the circus. I couldn’t. There’d be no 
way. Even now, I’m so still involved in it. 
 
But I think that it was so engrained in us that I could be out of it and 
walk over and be in it. 
 
Yes. 
 
I understand it. It’s part of my history. I don’t have the fear of ever 
losing that for myself, but I did lose it for my children.

Lots of times, I feel—I don’t know—I feel lost or something. Now, I’m 
going to sound really stupid! (Laughs) I hadn’t done it in a while, but 
you’ve seen those metal washtubs that they sell? I went and bought—in 
fact, I’ve still got it. I went and bought one and I—this was at the old 
place—and I’d go outside and I’d fill it up and I’d get a sheet—I know 
you’re going to think I’m stupid—and put up a clothes line, and I would 
get those clothes pins and I’d put it all up, and I’d put that tub in there 
where the water spigot is, and I would go take a bath in it so I could feel 
like I was on the circus. Doesn’t that sound—I know it sounds stupid, 
but it’s a part of me that I miss and I like and I enjoy. I said, “A lot of 
people can’t live without their buttons and their cell phones, their 
computers,” I said, “What are they ever going to do if they cut the 
water? What are they going to do if there are never any lights? How are 
they going to survive?” I’ll survive because I know how. 
 
That’s right. 
 
I know how to do without any of that stuff. 
 
My mother had three buckets and she had her name on every one of 
them and Lord, do not get one of her buckets! (Laughs) She would send 
somebody to go get her water, because when you first get on the lot and 
stuff, there was no other way to get clean. There wasn’t any showers like 
they have now. Later on in life, they ended up having trains or areas 
where you could go shower, but back in those days they didn’t. 
 
Self-contained trailers. 
 
We didn’t have that. 
 
We didn’t have self-contained trailers. 
 
And Lord, you didn’t touch that bucket of water. She’d have her three 
buckets of water—don’t even look at them! (Laughs) 
 
Do you know, today, I could take a bath in a gallon of water? 
 
Yes. 
 
And wash my hair and rinse my hair and take a complete bath in a gallon 
of water. 
 
But it was out of necessity, it really was.  
 
Now, we have those self-contained trailers, where you have your 
running water even though there’s only so much water that can fill in

that tank. When we’re on the show, “Okay! The trailer’s full. You get 
wet, you shut it off, you soap up, you rinse off.” That way there’s plenty 
of water for the rest of them. We come home and they turn the water on 
and when they get in they shut it off, they get soaped up. I said, “No! 
You can leave this one running!” (Laughter) “We’ve got running 
water!” But it’s just a way they learn to conserve and the same with the 
lights. Oh, God! I don’t want any lights on. If you’re not in there using 
them—and you’re lucky you’ve got lights on right now! (Laughter) 
Because on the road, the lights came on at a certain time, they went off 
at a certain time. You better have everything you needed done that 
needed lights. 
 
In fact, I’m going to tell you a story. My mom and dad had just gotten 
this new trailer. It was a Midway. Our lights went out. Well, way back 
when, they used to have those candles. They still have those candles. 
And so you’d have it in a candle holder and I’d put it up on this little 
shelf by the window. Well, low and behold, the little wind came up 
behind it. I left it on and went and did the riding act. When we came 
back the front of the trailer was on fire… 
 
Oh, wow! 
 
…because that curtain had caught on fire. 
 
That’s scary. 
 
Well, they got it out though. We still had a trailer. (Laughs) You 
remember that old Midway, over there. Did you ever notice that burnt 
area. It was darker. 
 
I never knew why. I do now! (Laughs) 
 
Now you know. They cleaned it all and everything and they, I don’t 
know, with sand paper. They varnished it, but it was always darker than 
the rest because that side of the trailer was on fire. (Laughs) 
 
Was that a major decision when they decided to get a trailer? 
 
Yes. When my father and my mother first got married and everything—
and back then, it was like the whole family was together and they got 
one salary. I’m going to use this for an example. Say they got fifteen 
hundred dollars for the week and there are how many in this family? 
There’s my grandfather, my grandmother, my aunt Albertina and her 
husband, there’s… 
 
There were seven kids and their spouses.

…and their husbands and wives. Well, that fifteen hundred dollars, you 
might’ve gotten ten because the money, my grandfather controlled and 
my aunt Albertina. They paid for all—everybody ate together. I mean, 
everything was there. 
 
All your needs were taken care of, but the money went into a pool and 
so in the wintertime they would have money to survive on. 
 
To survive on, okay. Now, if the aunts or the uncles or whoever made 
extra money, that money they would use to buy their own trailer or 
whatever. But say they didn’t, it was a family trailer. If they just made a 
decision, my grandfather and my aunt would make the decision or my 
grandfather, aunt and my uncle Giustino, who were the oldest, are the 
ones that took care of the rest of the family. When my father married my 
mother, they got them a car. They either had a car or they had a trailer. 
Well, they couldn’t bring a trailer because they didn’t have anything to 
pull it with. They chose a Woody. Do you remember what a Woody is? 
Okay, they had a Woody, and so they would go when they worked, 
wherever the buildings were, they always had stalls for the horses and 
stuff. Papa pulled that little Woody right up next to there and Momma 
would unload it. She’d move into a stall. She’s put her bales of hay and 
they would drape something over it. 
 
That’d be the table. (Laughs) 
 
She put her little electric stove up there and stuff. She wrote back to her 
mother in Italy, “I feel like the Virgin Mary.” (Laughter) “I’m living in a 
stall. All I need is a cow and a sheep!” That’s how they did for a real 
long time, but it always went through the older family, the eldest. If they 
had the money, they’d buy them, “Okay, now you get the trailer,” like 
that. Unless they had a side act or something that they did on their own 
that didn’t conflict with the family and they made extra money, that 
money was theirs to do what they wanted with. 
 
I remember one year my mother and dad had bought a brand new trailer. 
They already had the car, they had a Buick. We pulled in on the lot—I 
guess I might’ve been about six or something, maybe even seven—they 
pull in on the lot and he says, “Where do you want to park this thing?” 
She points to some tree. My dad backs it up over there and by the time 
he gets it about lined up and ready to set it up she said, “Well, I think I 
want to go over there, because Simona’s parked over there.” So he 
moved it again and he put it over there. Well, then somebody else came 
in, one of the other sisters and she said, “Well, you know, there’s a 
shade tree over there.” He moves it the third time. The fourth time when 
she wants to move it, he pulls it up where the tree was at and he backs it

into it. He said he hit the tree, but then he says, “You’re parked!” 
(Laughter) She didn’t move it anymore, but he was moving it all over 
that place! 
 
I remember this one time my aunt Zefta, my father and my aunt Zefta 
were very close. We were discussing this the other day. My aunt 
Albertina was the oldest and there was a big age difference between her 
and her siblings. My uncle Giustino, my aunt Germana, and my aunt 
Esterina were real close. They were real close because they were in the 
same age [range]. Then my father and her [Dolly’s] mother were very 
close. 
 
They were younger than the other ones. 
 
Then Simona was the youngest and like she said, she was left in Europe. 
But her mother, I remember—well, I don’t remember them buying this 
little green trailer—my mom and dad… 
 
Did it have a crease in the back? (Laughs) 
 
They wrecked their trailer or something happened to their trailer, I don’t 
know. But I remember we moved into this little… 
 
And it was little! 
 
I think it’s as big as this couch. (Laughter) It was just a little thing and it 
was green! 
 
It was dark green. Like a hunter green. I remember that thing. 
 
It was green! I remember green! Then, one morning we heard [imitates a 
frog] all over this trailer. It was covered with frogs! It attracted every 
frog in Florida I think! This little trailer that they had. I wonder if it’s the 
one they ran into the tree. 
 
That’s why I asked if it had a crease in the back. (Laughs) 
 
I don’t remember. Then I remember one time, I was still real small when 
the family—I don’t know if you remember this—the family had their 
circus. They took it to the Keys. Do you not remember that? When they 
took it… 
 
Tell me a little more. I don’t remember yet. 
 
They took it to the Keys. Oh, I can’t remember all of it, but I remember 
coming back. We were coming back and we were like in a hurricane and

it had knocked down all the telephone poles that were on that, across the 
bridge or the road… 
 
You would remember that if you lived in Miami, going across that to the 
Keys. 
 
…and those telephone poles had all fallen onto—and I remember we 
were parked along the side of the road because we couldn’t go any 
further because of the light poles. All the circus trucks were in a line and 
stuff. I guess they must’ve cut the lights off or I’d be electrocuted by 
now, but they used to have these blue things on the light poles. 
 
Conductors. 
 
These blue things that were made out of glass and I was picking them all 
up. Then I remember that somebody went somewhere to get some food 
for everybody and they built like a bonfire or something and were 
cooking outside or something. That’s how we ate until they got that 
cleared off. 
 
I don’t remember. 
 
Do you not remember? 
 
I don’t remember that. 
 
I remember that. 
 
I might not have been there. 
 
Well, somebody was there. (Laughter) I wasn’t there by myself! 
 
Okay. 
 
Well, you’re saying yes, you remember that and then, “Oh, well, I 
might’ve not been there.” 
 
I don’t remember it, okay! (Laughs) 
 
Was there a point when the family decided to kind of go on their 
separate ways and kind of split off? 
 
Okay. We left in ’55 and came here. But then when my grandfather died, 
they went back to the family and they took their circus to Cuba. They 
took the circus to Cuba and we came back in—well, whenever…

…whenever we came back. We’d lost everything down there because of 
the revolution down there. They stayed in a little bit longer and in fact, 
my mother got with my uncle and they were going to do a riding act. 
 
That was in ’59. 
 
That was in ’59 and then after that, I think Mother, she went to another 
circus, and I can’t think of the name of it, for a very short time and then 
she got out of it. That’s when she got out of it. They all did that. They all 
started splintering and going their own ways. 
 
Their own ways except for my dad. He stayed… 
 
But he did splinter. 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
He came over and did his thing, but… 
 
But we stayed in circus. 
 
…but they stayed in circus, right. 
 
We stayed in circus. 
 
How old were you, Dolly, when you said, “Okay, I’m ready to get out”? 
 
When I got out of high school, when I got married. I was eighteen when 
I got married. I graduated when I was seventeen and met my husband. 
My mother and I sat down and talked about it. She understood. 
 
Which was a smart decision. 
 
Yes, she understood. I said, “I love the circus and I’ll always love the 
circus, but in most cases it is such a short lived center-ring type thing, 
unless you’re extraordinarily good that after ten or fifteen years, you 
need some kind of a backup.” And that was my thoughts on it. 
 
When you start out as a performer, you start out as a child, like Dolly. 
By the time she’s thirty-five, that’s it. 
 
That’s your lifespan? 
 
That’s it. 
 
It is in that because you’re going to get hurt. You’re going to…

Your bones and your shoulders wear out, the bones—a bareback rider 
usually loses his knees at a very young age. They tear out the cartilages 
or something. My cousin, Timi, has had, I don’t know how many, 
surgeries on his knees where the cartilages or his knee cap or something, 
or something with his knee. I had been so fortunate that I never let it 
happen to me until I was going to practice one day. I was breaking a new 
horse and the person I had had the lead on the horse that goes to their 
bridle. They just hold it to keep the horse in the ring so he doesn’t hurt 
himself hitting the ring curb. You keep him so far away from the ring 
curb until he learns to run it without hitting it himself. I was vaulting off 
and on the horse. Well, normally, you are supposed to—if you get on 
that side of the rope it will catch you as the horse is running because 
[they are supposed to] let go of it. Well, they didn’t. They pulled it and 
when they pulled it, it caught my leg and it tore the cartilage out of my 
knee. I didn’t do it on the horse, the person that was holding the rope did 
it. 
 
But that’s true with horseback riding. With flyers it’s usually your 
shoulders. 
 
Their shoulders. Anybody that does trapeze, it’s their shoulders… 
 
And their neck, their shoulders and neck. 
 
…and their neck and that type of thing. People that do teeter board, their 
back, their knees, their neck. 
 
It’s such a high impact part of your body that you use. 
 
Like the cannon, your knees and your back. 
 
See, I did the cannon for a little while, too. I even did that. 
 
See, I don’t have any back problem because I didn’t do any of that stuff. 
I had one knee problem and it wasn’t because of the horse. It was 
because of that idiot that was holding that rope! Should’ve let go of it. 
(Laughs) 
 
So a bareback rider could’ve had a longer career. 
 
I think so, yes. 
 
More so than a… 
 
Than a flyer.

grandkids. Oh my God! [imitates scared grandkids] Because I have a 
defibrillator and they are so afraid that I’m going to have a heart attack 
on this horse. 
 
Well, I mean they’re probably telling you right when you do that. 
 
But I got that—on the DVD, I’m on the horse guide. 
 
We put our grandmother… 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
They took her out one year and she was going to tell my mother and 
them how to horseback ride. 
 
I had gone to Florida… 
 
How old was she then, in her seventies? 
 
Oh, she was close to eighty, Dolly. 
 
Yes. 
 
I had gone to Florida… 
 
And they had put her on that horse and she did a round on that horse. 
She didn’t stand up. She just sat on it, but she made a round on that 
horse and got off and turned around and all the kids were telling, “That’s 
how you do it!” (Laughs) 
 
I had taken my horses to Florida. I had to do something in Florida and it 
fell through and I never did do it. They had a big party and I think it was 
her birthday. I’m not sure when it was. They brought my grandmother 
and everything and sure enough, they put her on this horse, poor Nonna. 
[her grandmother] She was up there! She was up on that horse and did 
her little thing, going around. “See? See?” 
 
She didn’t perform herself? 
 
When she was young, yes. 
 
When she was young, yes. 
 
Yes, she was very, very talented. Her and my grandfather worked

together. 
 
Yes, yes. They were. That’s why my great-great-great grandmother… 
 
We’ll show you here in a minute. We’ve got a list that shows you how 
far back it goes. 
 
Okay. 
 
My son—I don’t know how my son did this. This has been several years. 
My son got on the computer and was trying to check back the 
generations or something, and he found a cousin of ours that had 
splintered during Napoleon’s reign that went to Germany. This cousin 
has done like twenty years of research on the Loyal family and stuff. 
Dolly and I were discussing, oh, we need to do this on the Travaglia, on 
my grandmother’s side now and see how many generations and what 
year they started in show business. For me, I consider myself a bareback 
rider. That’s what I consider myself, a bareback rider. But I worked 
elephants, trapeze—nothing like Dolly. Mine’s a half-assed trapeze. 
 
You were good. 
 
No, I just did a little routine and that was it. I never did anything like 
you. I did web. I did swinging ladder. I’ve helped put up the tent, take 
down the tent, and you’ve done the same. I remember back when we 
were kids and the family had their circus. We had folding chairs, red 
ones… 
 
We had to set them up. I remember setting those up. 
 
I remember red folding chairs and here I am, five, six years old, putting 
up those red folding chairs. We had red folding chairs up in the seats for 
the audience to sit in. I’ve driven stakes, I’ve put up pony rides, I’ve 
taken down pony rides, I’ve… 
 
If you could walk, you pulled your load! (Laughs) 
 
I did just about everything. Did everything but play in the band and if 
my grandfather could’ve gotten me to play that darn violin, I’d have 
probably been in the band, too! And juggling and I hated juggling. I 
hated it. My father was a fantastic juggler, but I hated juggling! It 
doesn’t do anything for me, still doesn’t do anything for me. 
 
I could juggle a little bit, just enough to say I can do a little bit. 
 
I used to go, “Ta-da! Ta-da! Ta-da!” in the back and that was it, the

juggling. When Tina was little, my daughter, we used to put her in the 
riding act. She was about three years old. I used to have her stand up at 
the front and, of course, she didn’t do anything. She’d have her hand on 
her hip and she’d be going like this. (Gestures styling) (Laughter) She 
came out one day, just crying. At the end they’d run back and they’d get 
her off the ring curb because she’d stand there. So she came out crying 
and I said, “Well, what’s the matter, Tina? Why are you crying?” She 
says, “Armando says I can’t do Tootsie no more!” because I used to tell 
her to stand out there and do “Tootsie! Tootsie! Don’t cry!” (Laughter) 
She came out, “Armando says I can’t do Tootsie no more!” That was her 
debut in the circus, doing Tootsie.  
 
But we did everything. I’d sit out on the tent when we’d have blow 
downs, like a storm would come and it would blow it down. My dad 
would sit out there—in fact, I’ve got pictures somewhere—and he would 
sit out there and sew on that. We used to sew and I learned to do 
baseball stitches. That’s how we used to sit and sew on that old canvas, 
baseball stitches, hours and hours. 
 
I remember we used to make the nets for the flying act. We’d sit out 
there and put them together. 
 
The flying act nets? 
 
Yes. 
 
Yes. And just… 
 
I think I can still make a mean net! (Laughs) 
 
I worked a set of llamas once. 
 
Oh, wow. 
 
I’m going to tell you, don’t ever work a llama act. Them suckers spit at 
you! (Laughter) You try to dodge those suckers. I had four of them in 
that ring and I’m trying to make them go around and up, (imitates 
spitting) and I’m dodging the spit! Cush! Cush! Let me tell you! 
 
She was more into the animals. I didn’t have to feed my act. (Laughs) 
 
And my mother is real funny, because like I said, she didn’t come from a 
circus family. She came from towners, excuse me, but she learned to 
work elephants, she learned to work chimpanzees, she had a bear act at 
one time, and worked in the riding act. She never did any aerial work, 
but she was pretty much the riding act, elephants, and chimps. In fact, I

used to get that chimpanzee’s hand-me-down costumes. The 
chimpanzee, her name was Debbie, one of the chimps… 
 
Those are some mean animals. 
 
…and she loved my mother. That Debbie would love my mother, and it 
loved her to death. Anyway, Momma had this little chimp, one of the 
chimps that she worked, and her name was Debbie. Well, when Debbie 
would outgrow the costume, I got the costume. 
 
You wore a monkey suit? (Laughs) 
 
I wore the monkey’s suit! (Laughter) 
 
I didn’t know that! (Laughs)

What’d you do about the back of it? (Laughs) 
 
Oh, shhh. No, it was closed up. 
 
Oh, okay. 
 
She wore diapers, Dolly. They wore diapers back then. 
 
Okay. (Laughs) 
 
They didn’t have Pampers, they had diaper diapers. But yes, her name 
was Debbie. I remember Debbie. 
 
I didn’t know that! (Laughs) I’m sorry.

I didn’t know about wearing a monkey’s outfit!

Lucy, do you remember the first time you met D.R.? 
 
D.R. Miller? 
 
Yes. 
 
The first time I ever met D.R. Miller. I’m going to say it had to have 
been in 1956 or the end of ’55, beginning of ’56. We came to Hugo. 
Okay. You know where the hospital is, right? Okay. And that glove 
factory right there, right, that they’re turning into a boys and girls club? 
Okay. That was the end of the road, right there. It was dirt road from the 
end of the hospital all the way down Kirk Road, past Kelly Miller, past 
Carson and Barnes. That was all dirt road. And I remember coming into 
Oklahoma, crossing the Red River. The road was like going down Kirk 
Road, back in the day because none of that—town ended—well, that 
wasn’t even in town. Okay. Where Angie’s Restaurant is? Okay. We 
were out in the country already. It was Angie’s Restaurant, but it wasn’t 
Angie’s. It was called Tyler’s and it had the old drive-ins, like the old 
drive-in where you pull up and they come to the car like an A&W, and it 
was called Tyler’s. Then there was a big span of nothing and then that 
little, red building that’s the bar, the Red Star, that was there. There was 
nothing beyond that. We were already out in the country.  
 
The hospital was over here and the road went out and you went by the 
hospital right there, a little road went there, Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
none of that stuff was there. That was all trees, all out in the country. At 
the end of the hospital, it began the dirt road. It was all dirt road, all the 
way to winter quarters. I remember Mr. Miller coming up and then I 
remember him leaving. That was the first time I remember seeing him. It 
was him and his father, Obert. Then they left and I don’t know how 
much longer—when you’re a little girl, it seems like time is forever—
here comes Kline, sitting on an elephant. This is the elephant and he was 
sitting like one foot here and this one over the ear, like that. (Gestures)

He’s riding up on the elephant and got off, hooked that elephant, “Tina,” 
made Tina turn around, hooked her up, climbed back up on her head. He 
pulled us from there all the way to winter quarters. It had snowed here 
and it was all mushy and nasty and you couldn’t go down the road. You 
would get stuck. You’d go off the road. They pulled us, truck and trailer, 
or car and trailer, I should say, from there all the way to winter quarters, 
and then D.R. was there to park us, showed us, parked my mom and dad. 
That was the first time I’d ever seen Mr. Miller. But later in years, not 
that many later in years, but later in years, he paddled my butt several 
times. 
 
I did not know he did that. 
 
Oh, yes ma’am. Not only did he get me, he got my brother. 
 
I could see him getting your brother, though. He was doing something 
all the time. 
 
But one of the things—and I don’t know if you remember this, when 
you were growing up on the circus you’re never supposed to hang on the 
guy lines. 
 
I know that. 
 
I was always hanging on the guy lines. I was always playing wire or 
something on those guy lines, trying to walk up like Zia Albertina on 
those guy lines. Always. I was hanging there and you’d be hanging, but 
you’d be hanging like crooked. He’d come up and let me tell you, “Get 
off the guy lines!” and paddle! My brother had a bad habit of going 
under the seats. Another thing, he didn’t want you under the seats 
because you could hit one of those jacks. 
 
Right. He was looking for change, I bet you. 
 
Oh, no. We were looking for candy. 
 
Candy? 
 
You remember those candies that used to come in those boxes? They 
were like taffy and they’d be rolled. 
 
Was it the Crackerjack? 
 
Not the Crackerjacks, they had taffy. 
 
Oh, they actually had taffy in them. Yes, I do and it had the plastic…

And then they had little prizes in there.

And we were always looking for those things that you put your finger in 
and you could pull them and stuff. 
 
Yes, Chinese handcuffs. 
 
Well, I don’t know what the heck they were called. Then they had those 
little glasses. That’s what came in the Crackerjacks, those little round 
things that you could hold. If you hold it in the sun and hold it over the 
thing, you could get a little fire started. 
 
You quit making fun, that’s where I got my first driver’s license. 
 
Out of a Crackerjack box? (Laughter) But yes, my brother would always 
go under the seats. Always! Mr. Miller just happened to catch him. 
 
Oh, wow. 
 
Let me tell you. He was something else. My brother was something else. 
Back in the day, they had what they called banners and a representative 
of the circus would want to make extra money, I guess, is how it 
worked. They would go into town, and they would go to the city 
merchants, and they would go to the grocery store, the hardware store, 
wherever, feed store, and would sell them banners. “Okay. We’re going 
to make banners”—I don’t know how much they charged, twenty-five 
dollars. I guess they charged by the size of banner you wanted. 
Anywhere from probably ten dollars on up and so they would come back 
with a list of these different merchants. They had this trailer and they 
had paint in the back of this trailer and they would have these big, long, 
white sheets of paper that came on a roll and they’d cut them. They 
would, with this paint, would put on there, “So and so’s garage,” or “So 
and so’s grocery store.” Then they would take them in the tent, and they 
had clothes pins, and they had like laundry lines, and they had those 
things on them. They’d drop them down, and they’d snap them on there, 
and then they’d pull them up, and they’d be all around the… 
 
They’d be like advertising?

Advertisement for all these different merchants. Well, needless to say, 
my brother found the backend of that paint truck, that trailer that had the 
paint. He painted the whole inside of that trailer. He painted the horses 
that were tied outside that trailer. Calvin Miller’s trailer is whose it was. 
And he painted those horses’ feet red, blue, pink, whatever color they 
had. I mean, he painted everything! (Laughter) And then he had paint all 
[over]. They wanted to know who got in the paint… 
 
Did he deny it? 
 
“Not me! Not me!” He had paint all over him. (Laughter) Boy, I tell you 
what, Mr. Miller and Calvin Miller both got him. Then another time, 
Freddy Logan, that I was telling you about, his son, they had their trailer 
parked there and my brother was always in trouble. Always. He was a 
little kid and his dad worked chimps and his name was Bob Mocks. I 
can’t remember what the little kid’s name was. But anyway, they had 
crawled underneath Freddy’s trailer and it was windy, and they were 
going to have a wienie roast, but the wind kept blowing the fire out. So 
they got this fire started under Freddy Logan’s trailer. 
 
Oh, no! 
 
They set the whole backend of the trailer on fire, because they were 
sitting there wienie roasting under this trailer! That happened out here at 
the circus, out at Carson and Barnes back in the day. I’ll tell you what. 
And the old barn, where I practice now these Appaloosa horses, I 
practiced in that barn. My kids practiced in that barn. 
 
Your dad practiced in that barn. 
 
My dad and your mother. 
 
Yes, I remember that. 
 
And my grandkids are practicing in that barn. If that barn could talk, just 
imagine the stories it could tell us. There’s no telling how many people 
before us practiced in that ring barn. It’s ready to fall, but still. 
 
Where is the barn? 
 
I’ll have to take you. Before you leave I’ll take you up there and show 
you the old Al G. Kelly Miller winter quarters. Carson and Barnes’ first 
winter quarters is out of town. When you come in, you come from off 
the turnpike, right? 
 
Yes.

Okay. Right where the turnpike is, where you get off to come into Hugo 
and you go under and you come—I don’t know if you notice, there is a 
veterinarian office over that way. Okay. And the sale barn? Okay. Well 
the sale barn sits right here and there’s a road that runs along the sale 
barn. Well, on this side of the sale barn, the house is still there. There’s a 
house on that corner and that’s the original Carson and Barnes Circus 
winter quarters. 
 
Ya’ll need to go see that. I’d like to see pictures of that, myself. 
 
I mean, it’s just a house. 
 
Still. 
 
But that was the original Carson and Barnes winter quarters and who the 
owner of the circus was back then was Jack Moore. Then when Jack 
Moore, of course, him and Mr. Miller and them, I don’t know how later 
on they were in partner together. This is my understanding , Jack Moore 
and I believe a man by the name of Franco Richards opened Carson and 
Barnes up. I’m not sure if Mr. Miller had invested in it or not, I don’t 
know, I couldn’t tell you. Then later in years—I’m trying to think, 
1963—1963, we went on Carson and Barnes because up until then we 
were still on Al G. Kelly Miller Circus, which was by Mr. Miller. Then 
in ’63, we went to Carson and Barnes, which was owned by Jack Moore 
and his wife at the time. Then in ’64 we went back to Al G. Kelly Miller 
and then in ’65, we went back to Carson and Barnes and then stayed on 
Carson and Barnes.  
 
The year, I’m going to say ’68—in ’68 I was in Florida for some reason, 
that winter. Zio Giustino was the equestrian director and ringmaster or 
performance director of Ringling Brothers. They were in Venice, 
Florida. They were no longer in Sarasota. They were in Venice so it was 
me and Papa and Zio Giustino wounded up going to Venice. Well, Zio 
had to go anyway, because he had to be there every day, but they wanted 
me to go and I was supposed to work for the Christensens, in their riding 
act. So everything was getting set up for me to go on the Ringling show. 
Papa was supposed to do something. I can’t remember what it was.  
 
But then we went back to Zio’s house, they got a phone call from Jack 
Moore. This was like towards the middle or first part of February. We 
got a phone call from Jack Moore, and he was having a lot of problems 
and he was in the hospital. He got on the phone to Papa and he told 
Papa, he says, “I understand you’re going to the Ringling show and 
you’re taking Lucy.” He says, “Alfonso, I was really counting on you,” 
he says, “because I know you know I’m sick and I’m not doing too

good,” he says, “and Mr. Miller’s going to”—I’m going to back up a 
little bit. By then, Al G. Kelly Miller had gone broke. What happened 
was he winded up selling. There were some problems and he wound up 
selling Al G. Kelly Miller to a man by the name of Joe McMahon, Mr. 
Miller did, and the show went broke. So then Jack Moore said, “D.R. is 
coming on the show. He is going to be my manager,” and this and that 
and the other. He says, “He’s going to take over the duties, but 
everything will stay the same.” He says, “I really need you to be there. 
You know how everything works, to help him out, and I’m really 
counting on Lucy,” and blah, blah, blah. To make a long story short, I 
didn’t go to the Ringling show.  
 
We came back to Carson and Barnes, and it was 1969. He died two 
weeks before we went out, but we went ahead and went with Carson and 
Barnes. In ’69, we were still—we, I always say “we” because to me, 
that’s like my home—it was a three-ring circus still, and I remember we 
were in the Chicago, going into Chicago and that was the first year, and 
D.R. made it a five-ring circus. He had gotten two more middle pieces 
and more poles. He made a five-ring, and it was the most beautiful 
circus I had ever seen. It was at Maywood Park, and the police was our 
sponsor. They had brought truckloads of sawdust and it was absolutely 
gorgeous, all this sawdust and the lighting. He had hired extra acts to 
come in. He hired a young man by the name of Martin Leontini, which 
your [referring to Dolly] mom and them knew the family, because they 
used to do the hand balancing and tumbling act. Then he hired a bunch 
of girls called the Cassidy Girls and they did aerial acts, and he had hired 
some other acts.  
 
From there is where Carson and Barnes grew its five rings. He had 
worked—gosh, we did Wheaton, Wheeling, Oakbrook, it was absolutely 
glorious. It was like a month of just in the Chicago area. When we left 
the Chicago area it went back to three-rings, but then the following year, 
1970, it was five-rings the whole year. Then, of course, we went back to 
Maywood. We went back to Maywood several years and then I’d been 
on Carson and Barnes. D.R. bought Carson and Barnes from Angela and 
Hank Hoover or something. I believe in 1970, it became his. That’s the 
story that I know of like that. But Mr. Miller, it seems like we were with 
him forever. Barbara and I grew up together. We used to be so mean to 
poor Barbara. I remember chasing her with a stick with a nail in it and… 
 
Oh my gosh! (Laughter) 
 
I was real hateful. I think about things now, you know. And Barbara, in 
her own right, was a very good little performer. She did bounding rope 
and she did magic and elephants. She was very talented. She was very 
talented on the bounding rope. I remember her practicing with doing

tumbling and stuff with a Mexican family and the man, his name was 
Maurice Mamalejo. When we’re on the circus as young kids, even 
though they’re not related to us, they’re our aunts and our uncles. Aunt 
Gerry, Aunt Flo, Aunt so and so, Uncle Dory, Aunt Isla, even though we 
are not related, but to us we feel like… 
 
It’s like a sign of respect. 
 
Like Moira [Loter Curiel], to me, Moira is like my little sister. I’ve 
known Moira—I knew Moira before Moira even knew Moira! 
(Laughter) I knew Moira when Moira was on her way. I’ve always been 
around Moira. In fact, Moira and I saved my cousin a couple of times, I 
think. (Laughs) 
 
How long were you on Carson and Barnes? 
 
Do you want to say with Mr. Miller or do I want to say…? 
 
In total. 
 
In total? Oh, goodness. I’m going to say forty-two years, forty-three 
years. Then I left and then I’m back. I’m not on the road with them, but 
I’m still involved with them so I don’t know how you want to use that. 
I’m going to be sixty-two in July, next month. 
 
When did you stop performing yourself? 
 
When I started performing, I think I was probably about five. 
 
When did you stop? 
 
When did you stop? 
 
Oh, stop! Oh, I’m sorry! Oh, let’s see. When did the Towers…? 
 
About ten years ago. 
 
The Towers, it was when the Towers…  
 
Oh, 2001. September 11? 
 
September 11, 2001. 
 
That’s the last year I performed—no—yes, a complete season. Then I 
did a date or two for my son, the comedy and that was it in 2002 or 
something. That was it.

Even though you were still probably training horses and doing all kinds 
of things, what was your reasoning behind not performing anymore? 
  
My defibrillator. If I had a good heart, I wouldn’t be sitting here. My 
butt would be on the road. It would be performing, if they would let me. 
(Laughs) I don’t think I would look very pretty in a costume anymore. 
But no, I did comedy there at the last. I did a comedy act in the riding 
act. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen it or not. It was on Funniest Home 
Videos one year. 
 
It was pretty good. 
 
It was really hard for me to do it because I am so used to riding the right 
way, that you have to ride like you don’t know how to ride. I know how 
to ride so it’s really hard to do like you’re not trying to ride. But I’ll look 
for some videos of me doing the comedy and let you have some. 
 
Yes, that’d be great to see. 
 
To me, it seems like I’ve always worked forever in the circus. I don’t 
remember not working in the circus, except when we’d come home in 
the wintertime and then I practiced and sewed. I’d go out and sew all 
winter out at the circus in the basement, or across the street, in the 
sewing room. I was always doing something with the circus, practicing 
elephants, practicing the riding act, or something. I wished we’d have 
filmed you that day you got on the flying act. 
 
Oh, Lord. 
 
The day that Dolly got on the flying act. And that was in the ’80s, Dolly. 
 
I was in my thirties. I remember that. 
 
It was in the ’80s. I’m going to stop and I’m going to try to think what 
year it was in. ’85—wait a minute… 
 
Maybe I was in my forties if you keep going up on that. (Laughter) 
 
Wait, no, no. It wasn’t ’85. I’ve got to go back. No, I didn’t have Tina 
yet. It was like ’79. 
 
Okay. 
 
It was like ’79, ’78…

Something like that. 
 
It was either ’78 or ’79 and Alfredo, Moira’s ex-husband, it was his 
family’s flying act and nobody knew Dolly. Everybody knew Dolly’s 
mother. “This is my aunt Zefta’s daughter, Dolly.” “Oh, yes! I heard 
about your mother. Oh, I’ve seen your mother. I’ve seen pictures and 
videos of your mother.” I said, “Well, you know she used to fly.” “Oh, 
yeah?” It was like one of those, “Oh, yeah?” Well, anyways, she got up 
there and boy, their mouth went—and they go, “Oh, my God! What 
style—Que stilo! Stilo tiene! Nina que stilo tiene!” I said, “Yes, you can 
thank my grandfather for the stilo she’s got, her style of flying.” And 
then like she said, she was so sore the next day that she couldn’t… 
 
I can remember that like it was yesterday, trying to get out of that bed 
and make it to the bathroom to get ready to go to work. I was so 
miserable! (Laughs) 
 
When Dolly came on Al G. Kelly Miller, because it wasn’t Carson and 
Barnes, it was Al G. Kelly Miller when her and my aunt Zefta came. 
There was a lady who did trapeze on the circus, but she wore shoes with 
gimmicks, and she had a net underneath her. She was coming to do an 
audition for Mr. Miller. I remember that. They told the lady she wasn’t 
working that day. I remember it like it was yesterday. They told her that 
she wasn’t going to perform that day, that they had a young lady coming 
to do an audition and they wanted to do it during the performance so 
they could watch her work. So they put up the trapeze for Dolly and, of 
course, there’s no net. There’s no mechanic and she’s all of what, 
eleven? 
 
I don’t know. 
 
Something like that and she comes in to work and, of course, her father 
and my father are there to watch her and she goes up, no tights, no 
nothing, just a little costume on and does her toes and her flying heel 
catches and everything. D.R. goes, “Yes, okay.” Oh, boy. Talk about 
somebody getting upset. 
 
Yes, she was. 
 
There was always a lot of competition in the circus. And here’s this little 
eleven-year-old, doing it with no gimmicks, no net underneath her and… 
 
You’ve got to understand, that woman was trying to make a living. 
 
Yes.

All I was doing was showing off. (Laughs) 
 
And she was taking her job away from her! (Laughter) 
 
That was funny. It’s not funny when you think about it when you’re 
older, but back then I thought, “Oh, I can do that! Let me show you how 
it’s really done!” 
 
She goes, “Lucy, I do that without shoes!” I said, “I know!” I said, “She 
has to wear gimmicks.” (Laughs) God, kids are terrible, aren’t they? 
 
We were awful! 
 
“I’m better than she is at that,” when we were kids. We were terrible! 
 
Are there parts that you miss, looking back, Dolly? 
 
Well, sure, absolutely, absolutely. If I had to do it over again, I probably 
would’ve done it a little bit different. I don’t think I’d have given up on 
my circus roots and gotten out of it like I did. But, like I said, back then 
it was just like I was running away from it. Yes, I do. 
 
We were talking and I don’t know if you noticed this with Moira and 
them, how Moira too, her family is right there, her kids, her daughter, 
her grandkids, and stuff. We were discussing this and my cousin, my 
other cousin in Florida too, we were discussing this. She says, “Lucy, 
it’s really incredible how you kept the family tradition alive.” Basically, 
like my father and his sister and the others—they all lived there right 
together. That’s how I am with my kids, except for Tina. She’s the only 
one that wanders off every now and then, because her husband’s in the 
military. But they always say when he retires he’s going to be close to 
home, which I understand. They get moved here and get moved there 
and everywhere. But then, like my daughter, Josie, she’s here. My son, 
Armando, he’s here. My grandkids on both sides are here. My daughter, 
Mona, comes home and stays here and stays quite awhile and then when 
it’s time for her to go work, then she’ll leave, but her daughter is here 
with me ever since she was little. Well, ever since my mom passed 
away, because my mom used to send all my kids to school and start it 
off. I kind of took her place, pretty much. 
 
You know, I’ve tried both ends of the stick. I’ve done circus and I’ve 
gone into what you call the towner’s life. And no matter what, it’s in 
your blood. It’s your roots. It’s your history. How many people can talk 
about that? Very few. We can all talk about growing up and different 
things like that, but the history of the circus—it’s a rarity, it really is. So, 
yes, it’s part of our upbringing and we’ll never forget it.

A lot of times people will ask me, “Oh, well, do you think the circus is 
dying?” I don’t think the circus is dying. I don’t think it’ll ever die. 
There’ll always be a circus in some way or some form. Maybe not a big 
circus, like Ringling Brothers or like Carson and Barnes used to be, all 
five rings. I always think there will be a small branch of a circus, even if 
it is just a ring and a small family doing with one trailer, or what we 
would call a dog and pony show. But I always believe that there will be 
a little circus. I don’t think it will ever die. I really don’t. 
 
Do you think there’s something unique about the tent? Ringling 
performs in large cities, big arenas… 
 
There’s a big difference. 
 
A huge difference. 
 
A big difference, big difference. The smell—I don’t know what it is. The 
grounds, the smell, I can tell the difference of working in a building and 
working [in a tent]. I’d rather be on a mud show than in a building. The 
only good thing about a building is when it’s hot, you’ve got air 
conditioning and when it’s cold, you’ve got heat. 
 
And don’t forget the showers. 
 
Oh, well… (Laughter) Well, no. I bring my own bucket! (Laughter) 
 
She has a gallon! (Laughter) 
 
I want to show you something, Dolly. I’ll be right back. You can 
continue the conversation. 
 
Where are you going? 
 
Right here to get something. 
 
She’s going to bring a bucket. I guarantee it. You watch. 
 
That’d be awesome. 
 
I just want to see that costume. (Laughter) I really want to see that 
costume! (Laughs) 
 
Well, I wanted to know why you decided law enforcement. 
 
Oh, wow. Well, my husband, my kids’ daddy and I, separated and I went

back to Florida. I really needed to go to work so there was an opening as 
a dispatcher at the sheriff’s office. 
 
She hadn’t done trapeze in a while. (Laughs) 
 
I started working as a dispatcher there. Then when I came back, we tried 
to work things out. I came back to Texas and started working. We 
separated again and I stayed. I started working as a dispatcher and then I 
went to the police department there in Henderson, and dispatched there 
for a little while. I walked into the chief’s office one day and I said, “I 
need to make more money. I need to get on the streets,” because I was 
struggling trying to raise my kids. He said, “Well, I’m not going to have 
a woman on the streets.” I said, “I really, really need to make more 
money.” So about two weeks roll by and he called me in there one day 
and he said, “Are you serious and will you stay if I pay to send you to 
school?” I said, “Absolutely. My kids are here. I won’t be leaving.” So 
he sent me to school. I went into patrol and did that for twelve years. 
Then they put me in as a detective and I did that until I retired. That’s 
where I met my current husband, was in law enforcement. It was a 
necessity and I liked it. Don’t get me wrong, I really liked it, but it’s not 
the same as circus. 
 
Okay. We were discussing… 
 
If you bring a tub out here… 
 
No! I didn’t bring a tub! (Laughter) 
 
Oh, I know what you’re putting out there.  
 
You said don’t forget the showers. Well, if it’s hot you’ve got cold 
water. If it’s cold and you’ve got lights, you’ve got hot water! 
(Laughter) [shows device to warm water] 
 
Really? 
 
Yes, that’s how you heated the water up.  
 
Well, they didn’t have these, really. Actually, this is from… 
 
Back then, they used to set them in the sun. 
 
Yes, this is what I used for my horses when the water freezes in their 
water barrels. I just run enough light cord to keep it from freezing, but 
you have to pull it out or unplug it. But then I go, “Hey, yes! We can use 
these to heat water up! Put it in the bucket and have hot water.” (Laughs)

How’s life different on the road? I’m sure you don’t have to practice a 
lot. 
 
You do and you don’t. It just depends on what you do. If you’re a 
juggler, you practice all the time, whether you perform in the show or 
not. The minute the show is over and the people are out of the tent, he’s 
in there practicing. A juggler practices twenty-four-seven. It depends. 
Like the flying act, they like to practice all the time. I didn’t like to 
practice all the time. (Laughs) 
 
You’ll also see them working a lot when they’re not performing, to do 
something new to put in the act. 
 
Yes. 
 
You’ll see them going in and trying to come up with something new to 
add on to that act. 
 
Or if they want to learn a new trick. 
 
Or if they have a new performer, they’ll work with that person. 
 
So at the end of the season when everybody returns to winter quarters or 
goes their separate ways, what’s happening during that time? 
 
A lot of them practice, make new costumes for the next year. A lot of 
them have winter dates. Well, they don’t have them so much anymore, 
but they used to have a lot of winter dates. They would close and they 
would go on and go—I’m going to give you an example. They have 
what is called—it’s in Indiana, Evansville, Evansville, Indiana—they 
have a big Paul Kaye’s days. It’s a big date. It’s one of the biggest dates. 
It’s in, I believe, November, in November. Then they also have one in 
New Orleans, the Hanneford date, there’s New Orleans. I think those are 
about the last two dates until after Christmas. Then in January and 
February they’ll start up again and they’ll have Binghamton, New York. 
They go to—I can’t ever say this town—Kipsy, Tokipsy, New York, or 
something like that. 
 
Poughkeepsie. 
 
What is it? 
 
Poughkeepsie. 
 
Okay, wherever. And then they have like Memphis. They have a big

date in Memphis, Saginaw, Michigan, and Detroit. They used to have a 
lot of big dates. Anymore, I’m not real sure of all the dates, Roanoke, 
Virginia, Atlanta. But like, Ringling has pretty much all those big 
cities… 
 
Sewn up. 
 
…sewn up, and they don’t go in there very much anymore. 
 
I remember them when the family would come in and most of the times 
they would come in around the first part of November. Now, they 
weren’t necessarily still working with the show at the time. They might 
still be doing some dates, but when they came in, in November, they did 
not practice until after January, because there was Thanksgiving and 
Christmas and they really enjoyed those dates. But as soon as Christmas 
and New Year’s was over with, they were either practicing or they were 
out on a date. 
 
Working. 
 
Even if they weren’t with the show they were going to be with for the 
season, they were going to find some dates to make money through the 
winter. If they didn’t, they would be practicing. They rested that short 
period. It was like a month and a half, or so. They did take a break. 
 
It’s really hard for the people with animals, though, that have elephants 
and lions and stuff, for them to take a break because they have to… 
 
Animals forget. 
 
…to keep them sharp and stuff like that. I remember Harry Rooks when 
I was a little girl. He would practice the Liberty horses every day. There 
were three rings of Liberty horses and there were six horses in each act. 
So he would have to go through that whole act, I don’t know how many 
times he’d go through the act. Then he’d practice the next group. But it 
was like an all-day thing. Then he did the ponies and stuff. They would 
come home after being on the road and the only day he didn’t practice 
was Sunday. That was the only day he didn’t practice.  
 
The elephants were the same thing. Right now, when Tim Frisco and 
those guys come home, when they’re home—in fact, men are up there 
now—he has his elephants or the elephants that he takes. He practices 
every day in the morning to just keep their mind alert on their thing. It’s 
the same routine over and over, but it’s to keep them alert. Consistency, 
like what I was telling you about practicing or teaching a horse. It’s 
consistency, keeping the same thing up over and over and over.

A lot of the performers, they just come home until after New Year’s and 
then I know we would start practicing, but I would sew. It would start 
after New Year’s, go to the Big House or to the sewing room in the 
basement and sit and sew and make new costumes for the next year. 
Have you not been over to the old wardrobe? I will have to take you. 
You will have to bring your camera. I’ll show you where we made 
wardrobe, where Carson and Barnes makes all its wardrobe and show 
you all the costumes hanging up and stuff that are still there, that they 
use at different times and things. 
 
Who taught you how to sew? 
 
Myself, my mother, really. I watched my mother sit and sew. I 
remember she used to get this… 
 
We all did the costumes. You learned when you’re little. 
 
She’d get socks and learn to mend everything. My mother couldn’t make 
anything. It was already made and she would put the stuff on it. I 
remember she would have somebody make my costumes, but Momma 
would put the stuff on it. Now, the only time Momma did make a 
costume, and I’ll never forget it, she’d go to a secondhand store and 
she’d buy somebody’s old evening gown, that had the tutu that went all 
the way around, like a prom dress. She would go to the secondhand store 
and it’d be somebody’s old prom dress or something and she would 
whack it off and hem it. And say it was too big, she would take it up for 
me on the sides and stuff and put sequins and stuff on it. 
 
My mother used to make all my costumes. She made this one costume… 
 
I remember I got one of your mother’s. She made me a costume, a blue 
one. 
 
She made me this one costume that was completely covered in beads 
and sequins. I mean there wasn’t a spot on it. The problem was it was 
kind of heavy. I almost lost the costume out there, on one of my tricks. 
One of the straps broke and I just knew I was really going to put on a 
show out there. It was at Sailor Circus. The problem was, it was so 
heavy I was having a hard time with the heel-catching tricks, because if 
you take that costume and weigh it, it was heavy! We had to have a talk 
about that and she kind of lightened up on it, but it was absolutely the 
prettiest costume I ever had. It was gorgeous. 
 
Your mom made me a costume. It was all black sequins.

She loved doing it. She was good at it. And she taught me, and her 
momma taught her. We helped with the costumes. But that costume… 
 
But to cut out the costumes and stuff, what I would do is I would go to a 
secondhand store or garage sale and there’d be a bathing suit or a leotard 
and I liked the way it was made or whatever. If it was a bathing suit, I 
would take it apart and I would use it as a pattern and make my own. If 
there was a leotard that they used at ballet to practice in or practice their 
dance in, I would take it and I would get a piece of chalk and I would 
draw on it what I wanted to cut out and how I’d want it. I’d cut out the 
holes or cut the back out of it or something and then take it apart and use 
it as a pattern. That’s how I taught myself. Now I know the material for 
the front has to go up this way. (Gestures) For the back, it has to go this 
way. (Gestures) 
 
The costumes now are pretty skimpy. 
 
Well, I’ll tell you another thing, too. The costumes her mother made 
weren’t stretch material. They didn’t have stretch material back then. 
She had to have the measurements, your exact measurements. Now, this 
is stretch material. All I do is cut it out and it stretches any way you want 
it. 
 
But back then, you weren’t allowed to wear those kinds of costumes. It 
was not thought the proper thing to wear. So what they would do is they 
would get this netting that was skin colored and then they would make 
the costume. But this, up through here, was not your—you didn’t see 
your skin. It was skin colored material. She would fix it to where you 
had some movement and everything. But now, the costumes really are 
just a lot skimpier. Back then, you weren’t allowed to do that. It’s just 
like when I worked. When I was little, I was not allowed to work 
without a net because there were laws. You had to be sixteen to work 
without a net so we’d have sitters underneath us, or somebody. But 
times have changed a lot, they really have.  
 
Where would you buy your fabric? 
 
She would do, kind of like what Lucy was saying, she would find like a 
bathing suit or something and she would measure me, and she would 
take off whatever she needed to take off that to make it fit just me. It 
wouldn’t fit anybody else. She would fix that costume and then she 
would get material that she liked, that had designs on it, and she would 
make the costume by using that pattern out of the material that she 
wanted the costume made out of. Then, where the designs were at, she’d 
put all the sequins on that. She did a lot of that.

This is a costume that belonged to my aunt, one of my aunts. 
 
This is what I was talking about. See this? (Holds up a vintage costume) 
 
Yes. 
 
That’s what they would do. 
 
The Ringling show made this for my aunts. This is one of their 
costumes. I have one more over at the other house, the old house. This 
one was a yellow one. Well, anyway, I got to wear this back in the day 
when it fit me. (Laughter) But it didn’t stretch like they have the stretch 
material now. They had to know your measurements. That’s like my 
aunt would measure. There’d be no way. For me to sew one like this, I 
couldn’t do it because I’m not that good of a seamstress. I wouldn’t 
know how to do it, but the stretch material, hey, it’s nothing. This way, 
that way, and I can do that. But there’d be no way I could make a 
costume like this.  
 
The Ringling show made these costumes for the family back in the day. 
If I’m not mistaken, I told Dolly, I said, “Well, I think this one belonged 
to my aunt Esterina.” I said, “I could’ve told you, had I not washed it,” 
and I washed the name off. But I believe this was hers, one of the 
costumes they made them in 1932, when they came to the states. I’ve got 
a few of their costumes I got to wear. I have one in a picture over there 
that I used to call it the blue one, the winter costume with the marabou 
around the bottom. Then there was one they call “The Velvet.” I love 
that red velvet costume. I loved it. 
 
I remember that costume. In fact, Momma’s got it on in one of those 
pictures. 
 
In one of those pictures. In fact, I’m wearing it in one of my pictures. 
That one belonged to the family, too, when they were on the Ringling 
show with rhinestones and blue on it. But I remember Mr. Miller’s 
family, Al G. Kelly Miller, bought a whole bunch of costumes that 
belonged to the family, after. Do you remember the yellow? Well, they 
were green and yellow, the cancan outfits and all of those. They bought 
all of those. They had all of those costumes one year. 
 
The family wore a lot of feathers, head pieces. But when they took this 
great big, huge headpiece off, there’d be a small one and it’d have a 
small bunch of feathers on it. It was so elegant when they walked out 
there with those big capes and those feathers and everything. Then 
they’d take the cape off and hand that feather back to whoever was 
taking it.

I’m going to ask Dolly if she ever remembers this. Dolly, do you 
remember the shoulder pad things that they wore under the cape? 
 
Yes, I do. 
 
Those big, metal things… 
 
Yes. 
 
…that made the… 
 
Why are you aging me, cousin? (Laughter) 
 
No, I said, “Do you remember?” 
 
I do! 
 
I remember them. 
 
Thank goodness! Okay. (Laughs) 
 
Those big, metal things. My gosh! They were heavy! I remember those 
costumes and those metal things, the capes. They sent them all to my 
mom and dad for them to use them. Momma took them to the Goodwill. 
Gosh, I wish… 
 
She did not! 
 
Oh, yes she did. 
 
Oh, no. 
 
Yes, I wish I had them now, believe me. 
 
What about shoes? 
 
We had what we call pumps. They were special made. They were made 
in a place in New York called Griffin’s, and I still have the address 
somewhere in that stuff. 
 
Now, my momma’s pumps are buried with her, that and her whip is 
buried with her. She’s buried over here [at Showmen’s Rest in Hugo]. 
She asked if we would put that in with her. Now, there was one problem. 
I couldn’t find—well, her whip is buried with her. Her pumps are not. I 
couldn’t find her pumps and I just panicked. After we had her buried and

I went back home, we were trying to get things ready to sell and move 
out of there and I found her pumps, but it was too late. So I had one 
pump and Gina had one pump, my sister, and I finally gave her the other 
one because I thought they needed to be together. So she’s got them, but 
we couldn’t put them in with her. I was really upset about that because 
she said, “Put my pumps and my whip in there,” but we did put her whip 
in there. 
 
So not to change your subject, but Dolly brought a gift for my 
granddaughter Zefta. It’s a beautiful—well, it’s aged now—but it’s a 
trunk that my aunt Zefta used to take all of her costumes and stuff in. In 
fact, it’s in the room right there. We are going to have it restored. 
 
It still has her name on it. 
 
It has her name on it and stuff. 
 
I just figured that it needed to stay in show business, and her namesake 
is still in show business. I know Momma would’ve liked that. 
 
I only wished I could’ve been alive or born in their era, because I think 
that was the heyday of circus, to me. I mean, it was… 
 
It was. 
 
It was the heyday of circus. I would’ve given anything to have been 
alive back then. There’s a place in Sarasota, it’s called Circus City 
Trailer Park and anybody that was ever in show business lived in that 
trailer park. I mean, everybody lived in that trailer park. So here in 
Hugo, we have a Circus City—well, it wasn’t called Circus City Trailer 
Park, but we had a trailer park. You passed it every time you went to 
Moira’s house. There’s little storage units there and then there’s like a—
I want to say garage, but it’s not a garage. It’s like they have a wrecker 
there and they have cars that have been wrecked and stuff in there, like a 
tow yard thing. That used to be called Modern Trailer Park and all the 
show people used to live in that trailer park back then.  
 
We lived in that trailer park. Moira’s mother, her grandmother, her 
grandfather lived in that trailer park. The Logans lived in that trailer 
park, the Zaners, the Rawls. Mary Rawls lived in that trailer park! So 
when you talk to Mary Rawls say, “Lucy wants to know”—I’m sure she 
remembers that we used to have catechism, study for catechism. I think 
her father, Willy, was our catechism teacher. We all grew up in that 
trailer park, Mary Rawls, David Rawls—well, not Mary. Mary was a 
mother, but her husband Harry, and they lived in the house. David, 
Bobby, Margie, Suzy, Chris, Michael, Cathy—well, Cathy and Billy

came way later. That’s like Gina and Timi, but the Modern Trailer Park. 
I don’t know, did she ever mention that to you? 
 
No. 
 
Have her mention the Modern Trailer Park to you. The owner was 
Dorothy Turner, was the owner of the trailer park and she was an old 
show woman, too, her and her husband. 
 
Well, let’s ask you one more question. 
 
Sure. 
 
Let’s see, Tanya, what’s that question going to be? (Laughs)  
 
Ask whatever you want, we’ll tell you! We’re not shy. 
 
Well, for Lucy, you could live anywhere. You’ve been many, many 
places. Why do you decide to make Hugo your home? 
 
This is where my father and mother came to work for Mr. Miller and 
everything. Okay. The circuses in Florida—I’m not saying we’re dying 
out, but the family was different. They left, Papa left, the family broke 
up and stuff, and we had work here and they always wanted Papa back 
every year on Kelly Miller, Carson and Barnes, whatever. My brother 
and I went to school here and our work was here. Our work was here. 
Well, then later in years, we’ve often talked about going back to Florida 
and stuff. Then my brother was killed in an accident and he’s buried 
here. My mother said she would never leave Hugo now at all, ever. We 
lived in the trailer park. We didn’t own any property or anything and 
then after my brother died, we bought a piece of property and had a 
mobile home put on it. She said she would never leave Hugo because of 
my brother so this is home.  
 
I don’t know how to explain it. I’m going to start bawling here in a 
minute. [Cries] I was always with my mother and father. I never left 
them. I grew up with them and then after my brother was killed, I knew I 
wouldn’t ever leave. My mother and my father wouldn’t ever leave 
because of my brother so I just made Hugo my home. I was married, 
divorced, he wanted me to leave and go with him. There were fifteen 
brothers and sisters in his family. He’s in show business. They’re from a 
circus family and stuff and like I said, after my brother left, he wanted 
me to leave and everything and go with him and his family and stuff. I 
told him no. I just said, “If I’m going to take care of anybody’s family, 
I’m going to take care of my family. My mother and my father don’t 
have anybody else but me. You’re welcome to stay or you’re welcome

to go. Your mom and dad have fourteen more brothers and sisters that 
can take care of them. If you want to bring them along, they can come 
here and live with me, but I’m not going anywhere. I’m not going.”  
 
My brother’s buried there, next to my aunt Zefta. My father and mother 
are sitting right here on the entertainment center, and they’re not going 
to go until I go. When I go, then they can go with me. The kids were all 
laughing about it and they said, “Well, Mom,” Josie, she’s kind of the 
funny one of the family, she said, “Well, Momma when you die we’re 
going to have you cremated and we’ll set you up there and Josie, she’s 
going to say, ‘Nope! They’re not going until I go!’ Pretty soon we’ll 
have a whole collection of Loyals sitting up there. (Laughter) Nope! 
We’re not going until she goes!” What’s really funny is when we get 
tornado warnings, being here in Oklahoma, those sirens go off and 
everything, one of us will grab the picture of my brother, the other one 
will grab the other urn, one will grab the other urn, and they go with us. 
When we go on vacation, they go with us. I don’t leave them here. When 
I go to Florida, they go. When I go wherever, they go. People will say, 
“I was at the cemetery, Lucy. I couldn’t find your mom and dad.” I say, 
“Oh, no. They’re here.”  
 
They just took a trip to Florida. (Laughter) 
 
They look at me like I’m crazy! They say, “What?” I say, “Yes…” 
 
They’re at the house. 
 
“…they’re at the house watching TV!” (Laughter) 
 
What? 
 
I said, “Well, I leave the TV on.” My dad loved western movies so I 
leave the TV on. They always had the TV on so I always leave the TV 
on. I said, “No, they’re there at home.” They look at me like I’m crazy. 
I’ll say, “But they’re in their urns.” So the kids sometimes go, “Hey, did 
you hear that?” One of the grandkids will go, “Yes, that was Nini 
rushing through the house. Didn’t you hear her yell at you to shut up?” 
(Laughs) But, no, I don’t know. There’s not much to Hugo, but it’s my 
home and I will never leave Hugo. You know, I can talk bad about it, 
say how ugly it is or whatever, but nobody else better. Like I said, I went 
to school with everybody here in Hugo. I know everybody here in Hugo. 
Everybody knows me. 
 
I was getting my kids a haircut one day, my grandkids, not my kids, but 
my grandkids before they went to Florida for summer vacation. I’m 
sitting up at the barber shop and it’s full of people. There’s this old man

sitting over there, staring at me. I said, “Oh, gosh! Don’t let him be 
putting the make on me, please!” (Laughter) I’m past that. He goes, “I 
know you.” I said, “Oh, yes? Okay.” I was like, “Was he one of my 
boyfriends when I was in school or something?” (Laughs) He goes, 
“Yes, I know you.” I said, “You do?” He said, “Yes, your dad was that 
little, teeny, skinny, Italian man that used to walk them horses out to the 
circus every year.” I said, “Yes.” He said, “When the circus would come 
home, he’d walk them home every year.” I said, “Yes.” He said, “And 
you were right there, with him, arguing all the way home!” (Laughter) 
He said, “What’s your name again?” I said, “Lucy Loyal.” He said, 
“That’s right, Lucy Loyal. I knew I knew you!” But yes, a lot of people 
will come up and say, “Yes, I know you.” They only know me because 
my horses are the only ones that get loose. 
 
They escape. 
 
What’s funny is our horses would get loose. And then my brother would 
be in school, up at high school. They’d say, “Joe! Your dad’s horses are 
loose!” And there would go my brother with his football buddies and 
catch the horses and bring them back. And there’d be my dad. Then, 
later on in years, my horses would get loose. “Armando! Your mom’s 
horses are loose!” And there’d go Armando, him and his friends would 
jump in the back of the pickup and go down—because they were headed 
to Carson and Barnes Circus—go down Kirk Road. They’d be all in the 
back of the truck, his friend’s pickup. They’d bring the horses back. 
Now, they call, “Christian! Your grandmother’s horses are loose!” 
(Laughter) So one day, it wasn’t too long ago, the phone rings and it’s 
Zefta. I said, “Hey, Zef! What’s going on?” She said, “Granny, your 
horses are loose.”  I said, “You’re in Florida! How the hell do you 
know?” She said, “Stacy so and so called me and told me your horses 
are loose.” So Tina and I had to go catch the horses and put them in. 
 
That’s funny. 
 
But yes, everybody knows… 
 
Your horses. 
 
…my horses are loose or something. It’s so funny. They know where to 
go. Sometimes I’ll get a call—this wasn’t too long ago—the dog catcher 
came, “Lucy,” he goes, “Your horses are loose.” I said, “My horses are 
loose?” He goes, “Yes.” I said, “They can’t be loose. They’re tied.” He 
said, “No, they’re loose. They’re right up here.” I went with him and I 
just looked at him and I said, “Finally, once, those are not my horses!” 
(Laughter) I said, “Those horses belong to”—oh, the man that’s the 
chamber, Mr. White. I said, “Those are Mr. White’s horses. Those aren’t

mine. I don’t have to run after them. I can go home.” (Laughter) But yes, 
everybody knows when the horses are loose, they call me. 
 
Dolly, was it your mom’s plan to be buried here in Hugo? 
 
We had two choices. We could’ve buried her in Florida, because we 
have a plot down there. She didn’t want to go down there, because Gina 
and I are both in Texas. She loves her brother so she said, “If I can’t go 
back to Florida, I want to be buried with my brother.” So we got her a 
plot up here. In fact, they had an extra plot and we got it from them. 
 
When Momma bought the plot, she bought four plots. 
 
See, she was intending to actually live up here. She really was. 
 
She was, like I said, she was going to live in that—she wanted to buy 
that place where Moira is now and she got sick. 
 
But I couldn’t let that happen because I couldn’t take care of her up here. 
And they were on the road and in and out and I told her, I said, “Mom, I 
know that’s what you want to do, but I can’t take care of you up there.” 
Gina was down in Austin then, and she certainly couldn’t take care of 
her. She was working and had her kids in school. So I said, “I’ll tell you 
what we’ll do. Let me talk to my uncle and see if we can’t get one of 
those plots.” That’s what we did. She said, “As long as I can be…” with 
her circus. Plus, she had worked some with the show up here, too. 
 
Oh, she knew everybody. 
 
She came up here and everybody knew her. 
 
Everybody knew her. She worked with all these people… 
 
It’s family. 
 
Yes, I used to bring her up here two or three times a year and have to 
rush back to go to work. When I’d get her up here, she really didn’t want 
to come back home. She wanted to be around the circus and everything. 
She’d have to come home for her treatments and stuff and I said, 
“You’ve got to come home.” 
 
And one of the things was when I was sewing on costumes and stuff, she 
would sit up there and sew on the costumes. She would give me ideas, 
“Hey, what if you do it like this? What if you put that on there?” and 
stuff like that. Zia was a lot of help, a lot of help.

But her and my uncle Alfonso were very, very close. 
 
Oh, they were funny. Oh, gosh! They were funny sometimes. She had 
just gotten back from the hospital and… 
 
I brought her up here. 
 
To know this family, how they really were, it’s funny. I want to say the 
Kardashians, they have nothing on this family! Let me tell you! She gets 
up out of the hospital, Dolly brings her… 
 
She said, “I want to go see my brother.” “Okay. Here we go.” 
 
So they’re sitting in there and they start arguing over her mother’s name. 
“You don’t know your mother’s name?” “Yes, I know my mother’s 
name! Her name is Stella!” “No! Her name is not Stella! Her name is 
Josephine!” They’re fighting over what her name is. Her name is Stella 
Josephine. 
 
Estella was her… 
 
First name. 
 
…first name. 
 
They’re fighting over the name. “No! Her name was Josephine!” “No, 
Estella!” 
 
Now, you’ve got to understand my mother’s really shorter than I am, 
okay? 
 
She’s real little. 
 
Real short. 
 
Real little and frail because she has been so sick. A long time ago, my 
mother used to smoke and so did my father, but they hadn’t smoked in 
thirty years. But she always kept this stupid, blue ashtray, a big, glass, 
heavy ashtray and he gets mad and he gets that ashtray and he hits her on 
the head with this… “Now do you remember her name?! It’s Josephine! 
I can’t believe you don’t…” He’s getting ready to hit her again! Dolly 
grabs it…  (Laughter) 
 
And I’m going, “You can’t hit her!”  
 
“You can’t hit her! She just got out of the hospital! What are you

doing?” But they were like this. (Gestures tight) All of them were like 
that. My one aunt, they’d sit around this table in their house, my uncle 
Giustino’s house and their kitchen was huge, huge. They had this big 
dining room table and I mean it was huge. They’d all sit around this 
table and then some of us would sit back. This one aunt, every time she 
had something to say, she’d stand up, she’d push that chair back, and 
she’d beat on that table, she’d pull the chair back, and sit back down. 
She’d get back up—do you remember Tetati doing that? 
 
I do. (Laughs) 
 
She would do that and they’d be arguing, but they weren’t really 
arguing, it was just the way they talked. The way they talked, it seems 
like they were yelling, but that’s just the way they were. 
 
My husband puts it really well. We went down there for Christmas one 
year and when we got back he said, “First of all, I didn’t understand a 
word they were saying”—because they all talked in Italian—“but they 
all talked at the same time. Not only did I have a problem with the 
language, but how do they know what each other is saying?” (Laughs) 
 
Then, my aunts and stuff, pulling these chairs out and hitting on the table 
and arguing, but they’re not arguing, that’s just the way they talk. When 
we get together, we’re the same way. And people go, “Why are you 
yelling? Why are you yelling?” 
 
It’s family. It’s good. 
 
On that DVD that we showed you earlier, there’s a part on there where 
all the families are together at a Christmas party and my grandmother 
puts on a show and stuff. Well, Christian had his friends over here, 
right? And he’s a real nice kid and he’s sitting over there, Bryant. I look 
over there at Bryant and he’s bawling. And I’m thinking to myself, 
“Why in the hell is he crying? He doesn’t even know them!” I said, 
“Christian, Bryant’s crying.” Christian goes, “Why are you crying, 
Bryant?” He says, “Look at the love! Look at the love in that family! 
Look at the love!” I started laughing and I said, “Oh, you don’t know 
that family!” 
 
Well, I would like to thank you for your time this afternoon. 
 
You’re more than welcome. 
 
And really sharing your lives with us. We really appreciate it. 
 
Well, we appreciate you coming and doing this for the circus, like Dolly

said. And if there’s anything we can help you with, anything else you 
want to know or… 
 
I didn’t know if you wanted to see some photographs. 
 
I do, yes. I just wanted to get our thank you in.
