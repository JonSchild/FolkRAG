DASHING YOUNG ARISTOCRAT 
SONGSTER. 
As sung by George Melville, the successful Comic Vocalist. 
The honorable Sidney Fitzdoodle 
is standing before you just now: 
I'm looked upon oft as a 
noodle, 
And often get into a 
row; - 
But this all my friends can attest sir, 
Although l'm inc'ined to be fat, 
I 
can take my own part with the best, sir, 
Althio' a 
Dashing Young:Aristoct at. 
CHOEDS. 
You can see by the style of my walk, 
The shape of my coat and my bat, 
My style and my air, and cut of my hair, 
I'm a 
Dashing Young Aristocrat. 
Of fashionable life I 
am weary, 
And from it I 
soon shall retire ; 
For everything seems to be dreary, 
There's nothing I 
really admire, 
Except Sir John Muccoo's niece Carry, 
Who says I'm inclined to be fat, 
And rather inclines for to marry 
This Dashing Young Aristocrat. 
You can see by the style, etc. 
My 
good looks I 
often do rue; 
What it is to be handsome alas! 
There's one girl in Filth Avenue, 
I 
notice whenever I 
pass; 
At the window, along with her poodle, 
For the last fourteen days she has sat 
Merely to gaze at Fitzdoodle, 
The Dashing Young Aiistocrat. 
You oan see by the style, etc. 
I 
really must thank you profusely 
For the kind way you've listened to me, 
And really trust you will excuse me, 
DASHING YOUNG ARISTOCRAT SONGSTER. 
If, by accident, I've been too free. 
The gents I 
thank for their attention; 
To the ladies I 
take off my hat— 
But to see you again's the intention 
Of the Dashing Young Aristocrat. 
You can see by the style, etc 
" 
Go It While You Are Young." 
Composed. by Frank VAN H ESS. 
Bung by GEORGE M ELVILLE. 
Respectfully dedicated to John Melia, Esq., proprietor of the 
" 
Hong Quo," 84 Spring St. New York. 
You've often heard it said, perhaps many times you've 
read 
To " Go it while you're young" is just the thing; 
For when you are old you know, your ideas are rather 
slow— 
So go it, then, while time is on the wing. 
These are the days for sport, at games of any sort, 
To while the weary hours that would be, 
We'll drink and gaily chaff, at the comics we will 
laugh, 
We're bound to go it when we have a :Spree. 
CHORUS. 
So " Go it while your young" is our motto, boys, 
For when you're old, you know, you can't they 
say. 
This is the time- for fun—join in, then, every one, 
And enjoy oursell-es I 
think as best we may. 
DASHING YOUNG ARISTOCRAT SONGSTER. 
There are some who'll say I'm wrong, wnat I've in-
troduced in song; 
To them I'd say we cannot all agree: 
Let those be grave who may, for me I 
will be gay— 
My way is jolly, plainly you can see. 
This life to all is short, I 
go in, then, for sport, 
Not drag my life to three score years and ten, 
With a 
wrinkled face of care, showing sorrow was my 
share— 
That's not the style for now-a-days young men. 
So go it, tic. 
Music, song and dance for all, in choruses to bawl, 
With a 
drop of beer to keep our spirits high, 
And merrily all friends that we do meet, 
Our motto is that none should e're go dry. 
So I 
leave the rest with you, and if anything you do, 
Remember well the sentiment I've sung, 
Then every week come here, the same then you will 
hear, 
That our maxiin is to go it while we're young. 
So go it, tg:c. 
My Friend John Barleycorn. 
First introduced and sung by FRANK VAN H ESS. 
All through my life, for grief and strife, 
I've had but little care; 
Or instead.of being stout and gay 
I 
should be sad and spare. 
Friendship I've tried, and love, beside, 
They're both like visions, gone; 
My two best friends have been my pipe 
And old John Barleycorn. 
CHORUS.. 
Hey, John Barleycorn, ho, John Barleycorn 
Old and young thy praise have sung, John Barleycorn! 
When soft and young of love I 
sung, 
And Fanny fair adored; 
She wed a 
man, who kept a 
stand, 
And all my hopes were floored. 
What did I 
do? did I 
look blue, 
A 
gone goose and forlorn ? 
No, not a 
bit, my pipe I 
lit, 
And tried John Barleycorn. 
Hey, John Barleycorn, Asc. 
And then a 
friend I 
thought would tend 
To make me happy quite; 
Soon one I 
made, who always said 
If down he'd set me right. 
A 
strait soon came, I 
asked his aid, 
He treated me with scorn; 
So I 
stepped it home, lit up my pipe, 
And quaffed John Barleycorn. 
Hey, John Barleycorn, &c. 
I've been deceived, but never grieved, 
Still kept my courage up; 
And see no harm, but more a 
charm, 
In enjoying pipe and cup. 
10 
DASHING YOUNG ARISTOCRAT SONGSTER. 
Not through the use but the abuse 
Of that, men wrong have gone; 
May we never need a 
pipe of weed 
And good John Barleycorn. 
Hey, John Barleycorn, Iric. 
Bathing. 
.As sung by Gsonoit MELciLt.r, the successful Comic Vocalist. 
One quiet afternoon in the latter part of June, 
My employer said, " James, l'll dispense with 
Your service from to-day, for a 
fortnight go away; 
Here's a fifty' for defraying the expense with." 
how nice it is to go, just for a 
week or so, 
From town to ease the mind from toil and slaving; 
Along the hills to scramble, and in the waters gambol, 
To enjoy a 
little clean and wholesome bathing. 
I 
was a 
single man, and my sweetheart, Mary Ann, 
In the country lived (the daughter of a 
farmer ; 
So, natural enough, next morning with a 
puff; 
I 
was soon locked in the embrace of my charmer. 
She met me at the train, and how can I 
explain 
My ecstacy or how I 
was behaving ? 
But I 
kissing was away, when I 
heard an old man 
say, 
" 
To cool his love he'd better try some bathing." 
So, next morning I 
arose, and the weather being close, 
Determined on a 
dipping in the river. 
So I 
told the servantmaid that I 
going was to bathe, 
r'• 
DASHING YOUNG ARISTOCRAT SONGSTER. 
And at eight o'clock I'd be returning thither. 
Two hundred yards I 
swam from the spot where I 
be-
gan, 
To an island, when for breath I 
almost craving, 
From the water up arose, turned round to find my 
clothes, 
But all had disappeared while I 
was bathing. 
shaking :was, like leaves when I 
saw the nasty 
thieves, 
I 
shouted out, " You sacrilegious wretches, 
Take my coat, my boots and hat, satin vest and silk 
cravat, 
But for decency do bring me back my breeches. 
But all was no avail, they were off and in full sail, 
Not e'en a 
pair of socks could I 
be saving. 
When, my troubles on to force, in a boat a 
gent 
across 
Pulled two ladies to the spot where I 
was bathing. 
Oh, judge of my surprise, I 
could scarce believe my 
eyes. 
When I 
saw that one Mary, my intended. 
I 
was dumb, f 
had no choice; if I 
spoke she'd know 
my voice, 
And look a 
thing that ought to be prevented. 
So I 
dodged around the isle, till a 
quarter of a 
mile 
Stood between me and the boat, I 
almost raving, 
When, agreeable to view, and by chance most lucky, 
too, 
I 
saw another individual come bathing. 
I 
soliloquized, " Here goes, I 
must have .a suit of 
clothes, 
DASHING YOUNS ARISTOCRAT SONGSTER. 13

DASHING YOUNG ARISTOCRAM SONGSTER. 
. 
Or they'll raise a ' hue and cry' for Mary's lover ;" 
So in I 
plunged once more, and swam towards the 
shore, • 
And took his, for one good turn deserves another. 
He saw me in the fact, and I 
scarce knew how to act 
To get out the dilemma I 
was braving. 
So away I 
quickly ran, saying, " Catch me if you 
can." . 
But he couldn't in the state that he was bathing. 
Like a 
tiger home I 
tore, kept knocking at the door, 
The servant she refusing to admit me. 
While creating these alarms, I 
rushed in Mary's arms 
In a 
suit of corduroys that didn't fit me. 
1 
very soon explained why I 
had been detained, 
And was laughing though the theft was most de-
praving, 
When a 
man wrapt in a 
sheet and nothing on his feet, 
Came and asked to see the gent who'd been out 
bathing. 
Said Mary, " Dear, it's true, this man is wanting you, 
I 
wish I'd known what made you stay away.. 
I 
saw you all the while, you were dodging round the 
isle '•  
But, to tell the truth, I 
didn't like to say so." 
So the stairs I 
stumbled down, while 1 
nearly broke 
my crown, 
And apologized for rudely thus behaving. 
But now rob me if you can, for I'm since a 
married 
man, 
And Mary minds my clothes when I 
go bathing. 
The Will for the Deed. 
Written and Sung by FRANK VAN H ESS. 
Respectfully dedicated to George Melville, the successful Comics 
Vocalist. 
Weighed in the Balance and found not Wanting." 
You often have heard of the motto, 
That " Where there's a 
Will there's a 
Way "--
" 
Cold shouldered," it sounds to the friendless, 
A 
get-rid-of excuse, I 
should say. 
How much better to stretch out the hand 
To the willing, and help those that need; 
Suppose there should naught be returned; 
It's best take the will for the deed. 
CHORUS. 
Then do to each other the right thing, 
And happy's the life you will lead; 
There's merit you'll find in the motto 
Of taking the will for the deed. 
There are facts in the world that would startle 
The many, if they could but know 
The horrors and miseries of poverty, 
Through which many compelled are to go. 
Then to render relief to the worthy 
Should an article be in our creed, 
Though it's a 
debt contracted for payment, 
By taking the will for the deed. 
Then do to each, &v. 
The future may bring to us sorrow, 
Misfortunes unlocked for our lot;

To see me ould mother and Dublin once more. 
Fm Teddy McGlynn, from the town of Dublin, 
And that is the name you will find on me door.

If green I

The love in me heart for me country's repose. 
For light is now dawning, and Liberty's morning

Then Katy I'll marry, and no longer tarry 
To see me ould mother and Dublin once more.

And often drank whiskey wid Phelim O'Toole;

Were all of us sprung when we waked Tim 1s1cDoul. 
In the finest society, famed for sobriety, 
I'm welcomed with pride at each Fenian ball;

Who lives on Fifth Avenue, as big as them all.

In the garden of the heart.

That will spring afresh and new,

Budding for it's blossoming,

Alone, and From Home. 
As 
Sung by FRANK VAN TI tss, Balladiet. 
Alone and from home, friendless and poor, 
how many sorrows and slights I 
endure; 
Anxious I 
look for one face that I 
know; 
'Watching the crowd as they pass to and fro; 
Some look upon me with sorrowful eye, 
And drop a 
kind word as they quickly pass by; 
While others bestow but a 
cold glance of scorn, 
Nor pity the stranger so sad and forlorn. 
CHORUS. 
Sadly I 
wander by day and by night, 
Counting the moments in time's rapid flight: 
No one will come for me, whither I 
roam, 
A 
poor weary stranger, alone and from home. 
Alone and from home, weary, oppress'd, 
No one to welcome me, nowhere to rest; 
Where may I 
pillow my poor aching head ? 
Who will weep over me when I 
am dead ? 
The night falls around me, cheerless and still, 
The dew drops upon me, so damp and so chill; 
'Tis then that I 
long for the coining of day, 
For then the dark shadows will all pass away. 
Sadly I 
wander, &c.

As Sting by Gmosus MELvILLE, the Successful Coml.; Vocalist. 
Button up your waistcoat, button up your shoes,

Be like me and good for a

Come and be a

All things real, we have no shams, 
Except champagne, good champagne, 
We drink ' till the day is dawning;

Each one puts a

And on some doorstep sit and drink 
'Till daylight in the morning.

The Baron of the Rhine. 
As Sung by FRANK VAN Hess, Balladlst. 
A 
jolly old Baron once dwelt on the Rhine," 
In a 
castle so stately and square, 
his lands they were wide, and well wooded beside, 
Where he chased the wild Boar to his lair. 
He'd a 
buxom old dame— his life's earliest flame— 
And a 
daughter with bonnie brown hair, 
The minutes flew fast, he the days gaily passed, 
In his castle SD stately and square. 
CITORUS. 
His rule it was this, if' you'd ever taste bliss, 
No maxim from Cynics e'er borrow, 
Laugh and sing while you may, then be happy to-
day, 
And sorrow, put off till to-
morrow. 
Of vassals, the Baron had many I 
ween, 
His board ' twas a 
pleasure to share, 
Both summer and spring did their luxuries bring, 
There was always enough and to spare. 
When Christmas came round, how his heart it would 
bound, 
While the yule log on high threw its glare, 
What jokes then he'd crack, as he tippled his sack, 
In his castle so stately and square. 
• 
his rule it was this, &c. 
This Baron so gay has long since passed away, 
With his dame, and his daughter so fair, 
his castle still stands in its well wooded lands, 
But the walls are dismantled and bare. - 
In its halls there now dwells a 
famed ceho that tells, 
Of thc revelry once reigning there. 
And the capital plon of the merry old man, 
In his castle so stately and square. 
His rule it was this, &c.

A s

In this world I've gained my knowledge, 
And for it I

Though I 
never went to college, 
Yet, Pve heard the poets say— 
Life is like a 
mighty river, 
Rolling on from day to day, 
Men are vessels launched upon it, 
Sometimes wrecked and cast away. 
So, then, do your best for one another, 
!‘laking life a 
happy dream, 
Help a 
worn and weary brother, 
Pulling hard against the stream. 
Many a 
bright good-hearted fellow, 
Many a 
noble-minded man, 
Finds himself in water-shallow; 
Then, assist him, if you can. 
Some succeed at every turning, 
Fortune favors every scheme; 
Others, too, though more deserving, 
Have to pull against the stream. 
So, then, do your best, &c.

And you've weathered every swell, 
Think of those who luckless labor,

Don't give way to foolish sorrow, 
Let this keep you in good cheer,

Jones's Sister. 
As 
sung by GEORGE listrittit, the successful Comic Vocalist. 
My old friend Jones a 
nice farm owns, 
And he asked me if I'd go, 
A 
month to spend, and to such a 
friend, 
Of course I'd not say no. 
On the appointed day, Jones had to stay 
In town, so I 
went alone. 
'Be as much at home,' said Jones, ' till I 
come, 
As if all were your own.' 
I 
was met down there by one so fair, 
No mortal could resist her; 
I 
made up my mind to be uncommonly kind 
To my friend Jones's sister. 
Quite pleased, I 
had the right address, 
I 
said, " Is your name Jones ?" 
A 
lucky guess, she answered, " Yes," 
In such sweet silvery tones. 
" 
Miss Jones ?" " Well not so much a 
miss," 
Replied this charming jester. 
I 
felt quite certain after this, 
That she was Jones's sister. 
She was so fair, I 
do declare, 
No mortal could resist her, 
And at first sight I 
fell downright 
In love with Jones's sister. 
Day after day soon passed away, 
So pleasantly and nice; 
Friend Jones was right, from morn till night, 
1 
followed his advice. 
As if all were my own down there, 
I 
made myself at home; 
And was half inclined to speak my mind, 
Before friend Jones could come, 
She was so fair, I 
do declare, 
No mortal could resist her, 
I 
walked many a 
mile, to get a 
smile 
From my friend Jones's sister. 
The news one morning I 
received, 
Thit Jones was coming down; 
And if I 
am to be believed, 
24 
DASHING YOUNG ARISTOCRAT SONGSTER. 
I 
wished he'd stopped in town. 
I 
never shall forget, when they first met, 
0 
how he hugg'd and kiss'd her, 
So pleased she seem'd, I 
little dream'd 
He was half so fond of sister. 
She was so fair, I 
do declare, 
No mortal could resist her; 
And I 
vow'd on my life, if I 
ever had a

This charming fair, I

No mortal could resist her; 
But on my life it was Jones's wife, 
Instead of Jones's sister. 
Quite overcome with grief and shame, 
My tongue refused its use; 
When Jones to my ' sistance came, 
And said,

The fault's my own, I 
might have known,

To see that bright and beaming eye,

A. justice of the peace, he was, and also an M. P., 
Was fettered to no party, his principles were free; 
He courted not the Premier, his sons were in the 
guards, 
With Fox he sometimes voted, but much oftener play-
ed at cards. 
He kept a 
steed of racers, 'twas his joy to see them 
run, 
His side-boards were well covered, with the gold cups 
they had won. 
To the town he represented, each year he gave a 
plate, 
And to the course in coach and six he always drove 
in state. 
Six goodly nags they were forsooth though very fat 
and slow, 
Their manes well decked with ribbons, their flowing 
tails also. 
His lady sat beside him, tall and upright as a 
wand, 
And the people loudly cheered him, as he alighted at 
the stand. 
He kept a 
rack of Fox-houndsr 
of the pure old Eng-
lish breed, 
Most musical and staunch they were, but not much 
fam'd for speed. 
His hunters were enduring, could go a 
decent pace, 
To suit his hounds he bred them, not to run a 
steeple 
chase. 
O'er hedge and gate he boldly went, nor stopped at 
ditch nor brook.

And if he caught them sitting, why he showed them

Talk of shooting flying, about fifty years ago,

In the Village church he's buried, scarce a 
mile from

His memory is still cherished, and many people say, 
With this good old country Squire, good old times

Let Each Man Learn to Know Himself

Let each man learn to know himself, 
To gain that knowledge let him labor, 
To improve those failings in himself,

And guilty conscience strive to smother, 
And yet how harshly we review, 
Those self-same failings in another.

Whose whisperings oft make men confounded, 
And trumpet not another sin, 
Lest you should blush if you were sounded. 
Let each man learn, &c. 
If in self-judgement you should find, 
That you to others are superior, 
Think Providence to you's been kind, 
As you should be to your inferior.

Which oft-times men are apt to follow, 
First learn to improve yourself, to-day, 
And then improve your friend to-morrow.

When troubles burthen those we know, 
Or tears of sorrow rain, 
'Tis then we can some aid bestow, 
To ease the mental pain; 
For sympathy would soothe and cheer, 
Did we but take a 
stand, 
Beside the couch of suffering near, 
And lend a 
helping hand. 
Beside the couch, tie. 
Whatever be our rank on earth, 
'Tis well to recollect, 
There's nothing in the pride of birth, 
Unless we win respect. 
Some may be scared and turn away, 
From poverty's sharp brand, 
But the dread foe we'll try to stay, 
And lend a 
helping hand.

0„h I

The first girl I 
loved, she was— verily! 
With a 
groan and a 
sigh, VII lay down and die, 
For the loss of my Ruth with a 
cast in her eye. 
Her father and mother were awful severe, 
And never allow'd me to see Ruthy dear, 
Like Romeo and Juliet, our ease it was hard, 
For I'd serenade my love each night from the yard; 
In an old empty water butt, that stood on the ground, 
Secreted inside, I 
there might be found, 
'While Ruth at the window, would look down on me, 
When her parents tooled for me no one could they 
see. 
Oh! have you seen, &c. 
courted her long from the butt in the yard, 
I'd rasp on the violin and sing like a 
bard. 
But her parents found out the place where I 
hid 
And lad on a 
pipe to the butt—yes, they did ; 
The nest riight I 
got in, my sweet voice she heard, 
I 
sang 0 
my Ruth, " Oh! would I 
were a 
bird," 
I'd scarce got so far as " I 
could fly to thee," 
When or came the water and well nigh drown'd me. 
Oh! have you seen, &c. 
I 
left then in silence and returned to my h-ome, 
With slime I 
turned red, and then blue to the bone; 
I 
tossed head or woman which way I 
should die,

could not tell either for the tears in my eye; 
It turned up a 
woman and poison it meant, 
So then to the cupboard half drowned I 
went,

From that day to this my sweet Ruth I've not seen, 
All over the world— to Washington I've been, 
No hopes I

She flew from her parents home, just like a

All through their cruelty to her and to me.

Through losing my Ruth with a

As sung by FRANK VAN Hzs , 
Balladist. 
O'er mountain steep thro' valley roaming, 
how happy is the muleteer: 
With joyous heart, with jocund song 
From blush of day, to twilight grey, 
Laughing, winds he his way along, 
The merry, happy Muleteer: 
At vine clad door a 
welcome guest; 
By toil subdued, how calm his rest; 
Faded grandeur I

Build no rainbow castle in his breast, 
Thoughts of home therein are dear, 
O'er mountain steep thro' valley roaming, 
How happy is the Muleteer, 
Oh! happy, happy Muleteer. 
His native vale where flowers are blooming, 
Enchants alone the Muleteer: 
His rustic home, his lovely bride, 
Their hearts' best joy— the smiling boy-
Slumb'ring tranquilly by her side. 
These, these delight the Muleteer, 
For them he braves the mountain way, - 
The woif by night, the storm by day; 
llalls of splendor, dreams of grandeur, 
Never lead his manly heart astray, 
Thoughts of home alone are clear, 
O'er mountain steep thro' valleys roaming, 
How happy is the Muleteer, 
Oh! happy, happy Aruleteer.

They fall who are fearful of stumbling, 
And hard as your lot may be found. 
Did you ever know good come by grumbling?

And seek like the Bee for the honey, 
Finds something turn tip before dark, 
That brings to the pocket the money, 
The soil must be tilled for the grain; 
The net must be cast for the fishes, 
And only by striving, ' tis plain, 
Will fortune fall in with our wishes. 
Then halt, &c. 
Don't always depend on your friends 
Who fly with the tidings of sorrow; 
But rather your purse touch with care, 
And see that it yields for the morrow. 
In fact, be a

And thus by self effort succeeding, 
You soon will be able to say, 
Many thanks—but your aid I'm not needing.

Why Did She Leave Him ? 
As 
sung by ROBERT H. 
CLEAVER, Tenor. 
Why did she leave him ? they grew up together 
In the old church on the bright village green; 
Never apart on sunshiny weather, 
Ellen and Edward in childhood were seen. 
She had not wealth, but her beauty commanded 
Suitors; alas 
who could riches secure ? 
But when her hand as his bride he demanded, 
Why did she leave him, because he was poor?" 
A 
63 
He who was once 'mid the young and gay-hearted, 
First in the frolic of market or fair,— 
Wan are his cheeks, whence the smile has departed; 
Others may revel, but he cannot share. 
Bright are the eyes that around him are beaming( 
Cold is the heart they strive to allure, 
Save when at night on the past lie is dreaming— 
Why did she leave him, because he was poor? 
Now she rides by in her pride and her carriage, 
But where is the bloom that once shone on her cheek ? 
Haughty and proud are the friends of her marriage. 
Now she must feel what she dares not to speak, 
She perchance sighs for her earlier hours, 
Grieves for the sorrows that he must endure; 
Would give up the world for a 
wreath of wild flowers; 
Why did she leave him, because he was poor ?
