THE 
BIG SUN-FLOWER 
SONGSTER. 
The Big Sun-Flower. 
There is a 
charm I 
can't explain 
About a 
girl I've seen: 
My heart beats fast when she goes past, 
In a 
dark dress trimmed in green: 
Her eyes are bright as evening-stars, 
So loving and so shy, 
And the folks all stop and look around, 
When ever she goes by. 
CHORUS. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big sun- flower 
That nods and bends in the breezes, 
And my heart is as light as the wind that blows 
The leaves from off the trees-zees. 
As days past on, and we became 
Like friends of olden times, 
I 
thought the question I 
would pop, 
And ask her to be mine. 
But the answer I 
received, next day, 
How could she treat me so! 
Instead of being mine for life, 
She simply answere'cl: No. 
And I 
feel, &c. 
The Bottle; Or, the First Step to Crime. 
All the interest of a 
first class romance: the utility of a 
sermon.

The Big Sun-Flower 
I 
went, next day, dressed in my best, 
This young girl for to see: 
To ask her if she would explain 
Why she had shaken me. 
She said she really felt quite sad 
To cause me such distress. 
And when I 
said : 
Wont you be mine? 
Of course, she answered: Yes. 
And I 
feel, &c. 
The Husband's Dream. 
Why, Dermot, you look healthy now, your dress 
is neat and clean; 
I 
never see you drunk about, oh! tell me where 
you've been ; 
Your wife and family all are well, you once did use 
them strange , 
Oh! you are kinder to them, how came this happy 
change ? 
It was a 
dream, a 
warning voice, which 'leaven 
sent to me, 
To snatch me from the drunkard's curse grim want 
and misery; 
My wages all were spent in drink, oh ! what a 
wretched view ! 
I 
almost broke my Mary's heart, and starved my 
children too. 
What was my home or wife to me ? I 
heeded net 
her sigh ; 
IIer patient smile has welcom'd me when tears be-
dim'd her eye; 
My children, too, have oft awoke: " Oh, father 
dear," they've said, 
"Poor mother has been weeping so because we've 
had no bread."

My Mary's form did waste away, I 
saw her sunken 
eye, 
On straw my babes in sickness laid, I 
heard their 
wailing cry ; 
I 
laugh'd and sung in drunken joy, while Mary's 
tears did stream, 
Then like a 
beast I 
fell asleep and had this warn-
ing dream. 
I 
thought once more I 
staggered home, there 
seemed a 
solemn gloom; 
I 
missed my wife, where can she be ? and strangers 
in the room ; 
I 
heard them say: Poor thing, she's dead, she's led 
a 
wretched life, 
Grief and want has broken her heart, who'd be a 
drunkard's wife ? 
I 
saw my children weeping round, I 
scarcely drew 
my breath: 
They called and kissed her lifeless form for ever 
stilled in death. 
Oh! father, come and wake her up, the people say 
she's dead, 
Oh! make her smile and speak once more, we'll 
never cry for bread. 
She is not dead, I 
frantic cried, and rushed to where 
she lay, 
And madly kissed her once warm lips, forever cold 
as c;ay ; 
Oh! Mary, speak one word to me, no more I'll 
cause you pain, 
No more 
grieve your loving heart, nor ever 
drink again. 
Dear Mary, speak, ' tis Dermot calls. 
Why, so I 
do ! she cried. 
I ' woke, and true my Mary dear was kneeling by 
my side.

The Big Sun-Flower 
I 
press'd her to my throbbing heart, while joyous 
tears did stream, 
And ever since I've heaven bless'd for sending me 
that dream! 
She Danced Like a 
Fairy. 
I'll relate to you, Public, the source of my woes, 
They're worse than hard blows: for, nobody knows, 
When with lovely-our young heart like a 
cauliflower 
grows, 
And the girl don't care two-pence for you: 
The case it is mine, I'm sorry to say, 
Through a 
girl—when I 
think, my heart heaves 
Whom I 
taught to dance in an exquisite way, 
And sing twice as well as Sims Reeves. 
CHORUS. 
She danced like a 
fairy, and sang like a 
bird: 
She did, on my word; but, rather absurd, 
She doated on Charley', a 
man that you've beard; 
And so, she skedaddled from me. 
Then, her father sold goods on a second hand 
plan: 
He'd, when he began, no meat in the pan; 
But, from little to big, be became a 
great man, 
And he, now, has a 
hand-me-down shop. 
Coats, trousers and waistcoats, for him, she would 
turn, 
And convert the old shirts into new, 
When business was done, then her steps she would 
learn, 
And dance in a 
suit of light blue. 
She danced, &c. 
The first time that I 
met her, 'twas at her Pa's 
shop; 
I 
outside did stop, then inside did pop,

Half-a- sovereign bright in her little palm drop, 
Said: Have you got a 
suit to fit me? 
She showed an assortment: hats, coats, boots as 
well, 
And at last, I 
choose these, like a 
man ; 
She said I 
looked handsome, in love with me fell, 
From that time our courtship began. 
She danced, &c. 
On each Saturday-night, I 
my clothes would re-
deem: 
It's just like a 
dream, so stranae does it seem. 
Just to think we, on, Sundays, looked like King 
and Queen: 
When from " Uncle's " I'd borrowed my clothes ; 
He'd lend me my chesterfield, just for the day: 
And, on Mondays, I'd take him them back, 
The money spend on her, but, to my dismay, 
One morning, she gave me the sack. 
She danced, &c. 
But sweet Charley got clothes from the same shop 
as me, 
And, soon, I 
could see: with me 'twas II P. 
He made friends with her father, and with them 
took tea, 
And he sang them his last comic songs. 
His soft winning ways her affections did win, 
And then he took her feelings by storm ; 
He then brought her out, and he thus brought me 
in, 
For, with him she now does perform. 
She danced, &c. 
The Pledge; Or, the First Step to Fortune. 
Never was a 
noble lesson taught in a 
more interesting style.

never forget thee, Dear nary. 
My heart wanders back, o'er the waters, 
To the land that I 
left, long ago: 
I 
loved one of Erin's fair daughters, • 
And she's faithful to me, well I 
know. 
Her form is as neat as a 
fairy, 
And her smile 'tis a 
blessing to me: 
Oh! I'll never forget you, dear Mary, 
Or the bright Emerald Isle of the sea! 
Oh! I'll never forget you, dear Mary, 
Or the bright Emerald Isle of the sea! 
They forced me in sorrow to leave thee: 
But, my own, there are bright days in store, 
When the hands of the Tyrant shall grieve you, 
Lovely land of my birth, never more! 
Though dark is the present, my fairy, 
Olt ! how sweet is the dawn that will be! 
And I'll never forget you, dear Mary, 
Or the bright Emerald Isle of the sea 
And I'll never forget you, dear Mary, 
Or the bright Emerald Isle of the sea! 
The cot and the brook where we parted, 
Oh ! I 
see, every night, in my sleep: 
I 
wander almost broken-hearted, 
When I 
think of the past, I 
could weep.. 
I'd toil on for your sake, my fairy: 
For, there's hope in the years that will be: 
I'll come and I'll wed you, dear Mary 
In the bright Emerald Isle of the sea! 
I'll come and 
wed you, dear Mary, 
In the bright Emerald Isle of the sea!

There are many ups and downs, as throurrh this

No matter where you go—go where er you may, 
And to get a

But push along, go ahead, you'll have a turn_

Now, I 
don't care a 
jot, but take things rough and 
ready, - 
Troubles and misfortunes away from me I 
fling, 
And puts up with things hot, like Gubbins's old 
Noddy, 
With my pipe and my pot, I'm as happy as a 
King.

There's my wife, she's very tall and slender, 
And like the ladies generally, very fond of 
tongue ; 
If I 
tell her just to hold it, bless you, it offends her, 
So says I, " Never mind, go it while you're 
young." 
She often blows me up, while smoking by the fire, 
My pine sends up the chimney; the kittle begins 
to sing; 
The smoke ascends to the top of the house, but her 
tongue is heard higher, 
But lor, I 
doesn't mind it, for I'm as happy as a

For my dearly belov'd wife she'd kick'd me out 
of bed, 
But I 
sleep like atop all night on the landing, 
In the morning lit my pipe, and merrily did sing, 
" 
Cheer, boys, cheer! just at daylight dawning ; 
A 
fig for devils blue—I'm as happy as a 
King." 
Da diddley do, &c. 
This morning at breakfast, I 
upset the milk jug, 
Milk and the pot both went upon the floor; 
But, in return, at my head my wife she threw the 
teapot, 
Which scalded all my pate and left me Very raw; 
Next over went the table, the bread, the water-
cresses, 
! 
didn't I 
dance when I 
heard the crock'ry 
ring, 
And I 
sung, " Home, sweet home," while picking 
up the pieces ; 
All the time my wife was whooping me I 
felt as 
happy as a 
King. 
Da diddley do, &c. 
So be of my fraternity, I'm a 
man as never holla ; 
Care's but a 
silt: calf, life is but a 
span ; 
Take things rough and ready—just as they may 
follow ; 
Live like a 
brick and do all the good you can. 
Never mind your wives, for the ladies at times will 
be vixins, 
Yet let them have their own way, much comfort 
they will bring, 
And if they should like to wop you, let them for 
amusement, 
For it wont hurt you—please them—and you'll 
be as happy as a 
King.

When first I 
beheld her, she was linen collecting, 
Love's telegraph was working within; 
To think at a 
washing tub should be presiding, 
A 
creature so lovely I 
thought a 
great sin, 
I 
ran from the office followed her quickly,

The Big Sun-Flower 
Without hesitation she told me her name was 
Jemima, the laundress of Hoboken Fields. 
The very same evening, I 
called at her dwelling. 
Unexpected I 
was—alas ! she was out ; 
I 
sauntered and loitered, when soon I 
beheld her, 
With a 
queer looking fellow walking about. 
My handkerchief pressing close to my features, 
From observation, I 
said, well it shields ; 
When the fellow I 
heard say, come home with me 
dear, 
To Jemima., the laundress of Hoboken Fields. 
My heart was near bursting, love's passion rising, 
From knocking him down could scarcely resist : 
Jemima, I 
said, what means this behavior, 
When down the man knocked me with his huge 
fist. 
Up I 
was getting, the blow to return him, 
A 
loaded preserver at me he wields— 
Quite silly it knocked me, away be went laughing, 
With Jemima, the laundress of Hoboken Fields. 
The police when 'twas over to the spot coming, 
I 
told them some man was near taking my life ; 
They said, serve you right, you should not be 
accostin g, 
Or paying attentions to another man's wife. 
Another man's wife, said I, you're mistaken, 
This woman quite willingly yesterday revealed 
To me her address—told me her name was 
Jemima, the laundress of Hoboken Fields. 
The next day I 
called to obtain satisfaction, 
With such a 
saucy jerk of the head; 
'Twas only your custom to get up your linen, 
My address I 
gave you, that's all that she said, 
Excuse me, I 
answered your behavior was cruel, 
Its only your sex from my punishment shields; 
I 
forgave her, and since my linen well gets up, 
Jemima, the laundress of Hoboken Fields.

Jimmy Riddle. 
Now, I'll tell you, if I 
can, of a 
pretty girl called 
Nan, 
Who stole the young affections of this individual. 
I 
never knew no love, but I 
know it now, by Jove! 
And I 
sorrow through the treatment of a false 
young gal! 
She was a 
perfect Venus: and, had nothing come 
atween us, 
We might have been as happy as a 
big turtle-
dove. 
CHORUS. 
But a man, named Jimmy Riddle, what played 
upon the fiddle, 
lie managed to swindle me out of my true love. 
At a 
bakery, down in Grand, you will please to 
understand, 
I 
first beheld my Nancy, who behind the counter 
stood. 
She looked so neat and nice, while serving out her 
pies 
To the many hungry customers ! The sight would 
do you good. 
Rather hungry I 
did feel: so I 
thought a 
little eel 
Would gain a 
smile from Nancy, if not beneficial 
prove. 
But a 
man, &c. 
Now, I 
told my love to Nan, like an honest, good 
young man, 
She smiled and wiped her nose, and said that I 
was very kind, 
And if I 
would but stay till her twenty-first birth-
day, 
She'd think the matter over and let me know her 
mind.

To gain a

But a

Now, her birth-day draxvine, 
near, thinks I, I'll go 
and see her, 
So, in I 
goes, quite full of hope, into her little shop, 
But judge of my surprise! there was another girl 
serving pies, 
My head began to spin around, and I 
thought that 
I 
should drop. 
Thinks I: I'll know the worst, my brain it almost 
burst : 
I 
asked for Nan: the young woman my worst of 
fears did prove. 
SPOKEN :—Why, haven't you heard the news? 
Why, we have got the laugh at you! and I 
discov-
ered that. 
But a 
man, &c. 
Now, I 
doesn't mean to fret, though I 
never yet 
have met, 
A 
girl half like my Nancy, so loving and so nice. 
And as to Riddle, he, if my will should be, 
Compelled to live on nothing else but little pies 
And if his days they were not short, they're better 
than I 
thought, 
So, farewell! darling Nancy, though faithless you 
did prove!

poor little beggar one day. 
Who in strains full of woe did appeal,

He in finding his way did employ, 
As he cried, " Oh ! pity, oh ! pity, 
Oh! pity the poor blind boy.

In the bands of a

Who they say, is a 
poor blind boy. 
" 
Stand ! stand I" said the poor blind boy. 
This beggar-boy, bold in his theft, 
Stole her heart and bewilder'd her head, 
And the maiden in anguish he left, 
For his rags turn'd to wings, and he fled. 
So ladies, beware of all youths, 
Who begging petitions employ, 
And cry, " Pity, pity, pity,

Is It So Or Not. 
AIR :—" No Irish need apply." 
In these rum times fresh sayings quaint, come up 
'most ev'ry day, 
And after living for a 
time, as quickly fade away, 
Slang phrases are indulged in now, by high as well 
as low, 
And short sensation sentences are truly all the go. 
There's " Who's your hatter," gone defunct altho' 
some it ran, 
The same's the case with " Am I 
right ? or any 
other man ;" 
"How's your poor feet ?"" Where are we now ?" 
have both been sent to pot. 
And now the question of the day is " Is it so or 
not?" 
As tho' the great metropolice I 
sauntered Vother 
day, 
Tall crossway bridges met my gaze, which struck 
me with dismay, 
To spoil our public thoroughfare, it really seems a 
shame, 
One cannot but conjecture that our government's 
to blame ; 
The poor hard-working artisan, is driven out of 
town, 
To make room for the iron road, they pull his 
dwelling down; 
He often without warning has to quit some cher-
ished spot, 
Which is an arbitrary thing, now " Is it so or not ?' 
There is a 
saying very rife, you've heard it p'raps 
before, 
"

poor ;"

If you'll listen to me, a 
story I'll tell, 
Of a 
Henrietta Hat that was worn by a 
swell. 
He sported his tight legs a 
tweed tog and vest, 
But his tailor's nonsuited in costs he confess'd. 
His washerwoman, with whom he oft flirts, 
Says his pay is all dickey as well as his shirts 
S,4 
up as a

Henrietta Hat,

But what I 
will have a 
Henrietta Hat. 
Wherever he went the folks us'd to say, 
Mind that Henrietta Hat for he never does pay; 
Was there mischief afloat, it was reckoned up flat, 
And damages placed to the Henrietta Hat. 
If he went a 
wooing he saw with dismay, 
The Henrietta Hat always stood in his way ; 
A 
child was born to hint—'twas like him so pat, 
The dear little baby was mark'd with a 
Henrietta 
Hat. 
A Henrietta Hat, &c. 
As for brass in his pocket it was never the case, 
All the brass he e'er had was the brass in his face; 
And when asked for payment, as fierce as a 
rat, 
He cried, " Oh ! put it down to my Henrietta Hat." 
Yet he found means to visit balls, routs, and plays, 
But his ways and means were very mean Ways, 
Thouo-h 
lean his resources, he'd still cut it fat, 
All by the cock of his Henrietta Hat.

When the waiter announced that he missed some

But the Henrietta swell was took up as the thief.

The Big Sun-Flower 
Mr. Bubbs's Party. 
Mr. Bubbs was a 
man who'd retired from business, 
And fortune had given his head a 
great dizziness ; 
He had cabbaged a 
fortune by being a 
tailor, 
And was against Veasure and high life a 
railer. 
Mrs. Bubbs was a 
woman much given to passion, 
M ss Bubbs, his daughter, a 
lover of fashion ; 
His son, Nubby Bubbs, was of the same cast man, 
A 
hater of slow life, and of course was a 
fast man. 
Tol de rol, &c. 
Mr. Bubbs to keep quiet, oft wisli'd his wife out, 
For when at home she would worry his life out 
About his narrow ways, 'stead of being broad and 
hearty, 
And would not let him rest till he had given a 
party. 
Miss Bubbs took the hint, and went sobbing and 
cryin 
For a 
party of young friends, she vow'd she was 
dying; 
The son, Nobby Bubbs, advocated a 
mirth day, 
And demanded a 
party to keep up his birth-day. 
Tol de rol, &c. 
After much haggling, poor old Bubbs consented, 
To give way to a 
case that couldn't be prevented; 
It seemed an event like the affairs of a 
nation, 
The issuino• of cards for a 
grand invitation. 
Then to seek out professors they made no re-
strain tnen t, 
To give an effect to the night's entertainment ; 
Mr. Bubbs was delighted that Bubbs was so hearty 
To give his consent to give a 
grand party,

Mrs. Bubbs she invited her friend Mrs. Randal, 
A 
lover and great propagator of scandal;

And her neighbor, the rackety wild Mrs. Gradish, 
Who though married three times was really old 
maidish. 
With her husband's ex-foreman, who was rather 
behind man, 
Mrs. Bubbs thought the young man was a very 
kind man; 
Much younger than Bubbs, more handsome and 
zealous, 
And as a 
matter of course, poor old Bulks grew 
quite jealous.

Within the walls of home.

Thy constancy I've tried ;

It teaches me to die.

All thine, love.

Breathe not other sighs, love ;

Farewell, By Thee Forsaken. 
Farewell, by thee forsaken, 
Joy's lingering ray is o'er; 
My heart can ne'er awaken, 
To one bright moment more. 
The hopes my soul has cherisli'd, 
Have wither'd, one by one ; 
And tho' life's flowers have perish'd, 
I'm left to linger on. • 
The cloud of early sorrow, 
Hangs heavy on my brow, 
No sun- burst of to- morrow, 
Can brighten o'er it now. 
My broken lute alone 
Remains my grief to tell, 
And this, its parting tone, 
Can only say farewell. 
Oh! ' tis Not a Forgotten Name. 
Oh, ' tis not a 
forgotten name, 
Although I 
may not speak ; 
The hidden pangs that steals away, 
The roses from my cheek. 
They wonder oft why I 
am sad, 
When all around are gay, 
As though a 
flower could bloom *hose germ 
Was withering away. 
They say another has his name— 
I 
may not heed him more ; 
They tell me that my accents seem, 
Less joyous then before, 
Yet do not blame me if I'm sad, 
When all around are gay, 
For hearts and hopes, like tend'rest flowers, 
Are born to fade away.

In my breast to see her glide, 
With light anti graceful motions, 
And soon was uy her side. 
Oh, those girls, &c. 
I 
soon became her partner, 
As thro' the dance we passed, 
The closer— tighter, tighter, 
I 
hutrged her round the waist. 
Said I, miss, do I 
hurt you ? 
No, says she, trip across, 
In fact I 
rather like it, 
And so did I, of course. 
Oh, those girls, &c. 
Dancing over, we had supper, 
And chatted very free; 
I 
vowed I 
loved her dearly, 
She said, she fa icied me. 
Upon that hint, the question, 
I 
popped it, then and there, 
And swore for her I 
die would— 
I 
meant, I'd dye my hair. 
Oh, those girls, &c. 
The liquor rather strong was, 
Her nerves were rather weak ; 
To see her home to town again, 
A 
cab I 
had to seek. 
One of the springs was broken, 
We up and down did ride; 
But she said she liked the jolting, 
And I 
was satisfied. 
Oh, those girls, &c. 
Her I 
was going to marry, 
As people said, I 
ought, 
But she fell in the Harlem river, 
And, lifeless out was brought.

Dear Rosa, I'm Thine. 
In the gay dawn of life, when fair fancy had spread 
Her colours of manifold hue, 
When the heart does but little to sober the head, 
Dear Mary my suit was to you : 
But experience soon taught me that love was a 
cheat, 
And that she was as fickle as fair : 
So I 
threw off my chains, and revenged the deceit, 
And scorned the lone willow to wear, 
Where under the hawthorn rends the green brook, 
To the zephyrs that scent the gay vale ; 
My freedom, fond tool, once again I 
forsook, 
And told to fair Fanny my tale ; 
But soon found the nymph was to love less inclin'd 
Than to take the soft incense of pray'r, 
So the vows that I 
pledged her I 
gave to the wind, 
And scorn'd the lone willow to wear. 
No more chafed with anger, with love, or disdain, 
The tyrant I 
drove from my breast; 
Till the shafts of bright beauty renewed the fond 
pain, 
And to Rosa my flame I 
confess'd. 
Oh! joy beyond bound, when in accent sincere, 
She whispered, " Dear Henry, I'm thine." 
Not less true the pledge, not less honest the pay'r, 
When I 
answered. " Dear Rosa, I'm thine."

The Love Test. 
Oh, no! they never can have loved, 
Who say that love's a 
bed of roses, 
Where, when after hearts he's roved, 
Cupid, tired, in peace reposes, 
" 
Love," the sage with wisdom cries, 
" 
Is more a 
bed with thistles on it, 
HorE—the down that on it lies, 
And fear—the thorns that spring up from it.' 
Count the sands that gild the shore, 
Count the stars that shine above us, 
Here's a 
task bewild'ring more— 
Count the doubts of those that love us. 
Who could view the summer's storm, 
And doubt the calm that reigned above it' 
Who would gaze on Beauty's form, 
And feel determined not to love it? 
Mark the pagan at his shrine, 
Grant his prayer, for thus he'd crave it, 
Sooner than his heaven resign, 
He'd yield the life alone that gave it. 
Bid the sun forsake the sky, 
Bid the stars not shine above thee, 
And with this, when they comply, 
You may bid me cease to love thee. 
Who would pluck a 
rose, and want 
To see it fade within the hour ? 
Who would rear a 
tender plant, 
To see another snatch the flower ? 
Then deeply must the lover feel, 
Who, gazing on thee, passion smothers, 
And finds what lips no more conceal, 
The form he fondly loved—ANOTHER'S. 
Stars may now forsake the sky, 
Suns may cease to shine above us, 
Earth is dark to mortal eye, 
When those we love no longer love us.

Go It While You're Young. 
A 
thourrht struck me that I 
would go, 
One Stuiday afternoon, 
To Jones' wood and hear the band, 
Strike up a 
jolly tune. 
For home I 
found so very dull, 
And so was Missus B. 
Who follows Master Beecher, 
That she may lecture me. 
CHORUS. 
As we can't live forever, 
Let care from us be flung, 
The best of friends must sever; 
So go it while you're young. 
Straight for the street rail car, 
At once I 
made a 
start, 
I 
cross'd the street to get on board 
And then lost my heart. 
For on the seat sat such a 
girl, 
Deck'd out in fine array, 
And seem'd too bound for Jones' wood, 
To hear the music play, 
As we can't, &c. 
That crinoline I 
soon addressed, 
The weather was my theme, 
But that soon glided into love, 
As we pass'd o'er the stream ; 
We reached the beach of Jones' wood, 
And to her I 
did say, 
There is no harm you taking mine, 
To hear the music play. 
As we cant, &-c. 
Of course we walked towards the band, 
And found it had begun, 
With brazen throats to bid the world, 
"Go the whole hog or none."

We had some shrimps and tea, 
And were just going in for grog-
-When up comes Mrs. B. 
I've caught you, have I 
sir, she cried, 
Then quickly scratched my face, 
And like a

Did the fair maid embrace. 
As we can't &c. 
Murder! Police! we all did cry, 
And quickly I 
did holler, 
They to the station dragged my wife, 
Which just cost me many a 
dollar. 
We kissed and made it up again, 
But still think of that day. 
When first I 
went to Jones wood, 
To hear the music play. 
She's made me promise never, 
Such folks to go among, 
So think of me, and ever— 
Go it while you're young.

Buzz, buzz, always buzzing about one.

Which nothing but monkeys can dwell on. 
Her heart's like a

Like the wind, like the sea, 
Whose raging will harken to no man;

Upon the mansion floor; 
While wine and cider mull'd and warm, 
Came in at every door.

The Shipwreck. 
Avert you omen, gracious heaven, 
The ugly scud, 
By rising winds resistless driven, 
Kisses the flood, 
How hard the lot for sailors cast, 
That they should roam. 
For years, to perish thus at last 
In sigh of home! 
For if the coming gale we mourn 
A 
tempe$ grows, 
Our vessel's shatter'd so and torn, 
That down she goes. 
The tempest comes, while meteors red, 
Portentous fly ; 
And now we touch old Ocean's bed, 
Now reach the sky. 
On sable wings, in gloomy flight, 
Fiends seem to wait, 
To snatch us in this dreadful night, 
Dark as our fate ; 
Unless some kind, some pitying Power, 
Should interpose, 
She labors so within this hour, 
Down she goes! 
Be Mine Dear Maid, 
Be mine dear maid, this faithful heart 
Can never prove untrue; 
'Twere easier far with life to part, 
Than cease to live for you. • 
My soul, gone forth from this lone breast, 
Lves only, love, in thine ; 
There is its only home of rest, 
Its dear its chosen shrine.

Then turn thee not away, my dear, 
Oh, turn thee not away, love ; 
For by the light and truth I 
swear, 
To love thee night and day, love. 
'Tis not mine eye thy beauty loves, 
Mine ear thy tuneful voice; 
But 'tis my heart thy heart approved, 
A 
life-enduring choice, 
The lark shall first forget to sing, 
When morn unfoldes the east, 
Ere I 
by change or coldness wring 
Thy fond confiding breast. • 
Then turn, ftc 
Isabel. 
Wake, dearest, wake! and again united 
We'll rove by yonder sea ; 
And where our first vows of love were plighted, 
Our last farewell shall be; 
There oft I've gaze'd on thy smiles delighted, 
And there 
part from thee. 
There oft I've ;.raz'd on thy smiles delighted 
And there I'll part from thee.

Fare-thee- well I

Far hence I

Ali me! ah me ! 
Dark is my doom, and from thee I 
sever, 
Whom I 
have loy'd alone; 
'Twas cruel to link thy fate for ever 
With sorrows like my own ; 
Fights for the Championship of England.

Good night, good night, my dearest, 
How fast the moments fly; 
'Tis time to part, thou hearest 
That hateful watchman's cry, 
" 
Past twelve o'clock !"—good night! 
Yet stay a 
moment longer— 
Alas! why is it so?— 
The wish to stay grows stronger, 
The more 'tis time to go. 
" 
Past one o'clock !"—good night! 
Now wrap thy cloak about thee :— 
The hours must sure go wrong, 
For when they're past without thee, 
They're oh I 
ten times as long.

Past two o'clock !"—good night!

A

That I

With social friends to-night.

Fill up my tankard I

Good health to " one and all."

Like music to the ear 
It cheers the heart, relieves the mind, 
To know that they are near. 
And thus forever may it be, 
No matter of what clime, 
That man shall feel for man the same 
Until the end of time.

With hearts light as a

With cheerful smiling faces, they 
In social chat together.

Let noble hearts and honest hands, 
Join friendship on the way.

He starts! then sinks to sleep again, 
Nor dreams, nor dreams of danger nigh. 
In calm or in storm, and mid the battle's strife, 
His brave heart dotes on a 
sailor's roving life, 
And thus sings he right merrily, 
And thus, and thus sings he— 
"

gallant ship on the boundless sea, . 
With a 
jovial crew is the home for me. 
Whether it be mid icebergs hoary, 
Or where the rocks and reefs of coral grow,

Constant of heart the sailor's glory, 
At Duty's call is still to go, 
No danger can his soul appal, 
Resolvod to conquer or to die. 
E'en though it be his fate to fall, 
His country claims his last fond sigh, 
E'en though it be his fate to fall, 
His country claims his last fond sigh. 
He starts, &c.
