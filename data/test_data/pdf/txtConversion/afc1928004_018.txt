With love for her he crazy was,

His name, I've heard, was Buzzy Bird, 
But they called him " Stoughton Bitters." 
Stoughton Bitters, he was four foot two, 
But he dressed up in the fashion, 
And many charms his face peeped through, 
In fact he was quite dashing.

THE FANCY BARKEEPER. 
At night to see her he'd post up-town, 
With heart as hot as a 
cinder, 
And there he'd whistle " Old John Brown," 
Right underneath her winder; 
And then they'd meet, with kisses sweet, 
While love peeped through each peeper, 
And then she would with wittles stuff 
The fancy, young barkeeper. 
Chorus—With love, etc. 
Stoughton Bitters he was wide aWake, 
And talked as sweet as honey, 
And to Miss Dove he love did make, 
Because she had the money. 
Her bank account was a 
nice amount, 
And he, than Old Nick deeper, 
Says, " very soon, I'll rake this pile," 
The artful, young barkeeper. 
Chorus—With love, etc. 
One night, 'twas in the month of June, 
The tale is most appalling, 
His darling, being all alone, 
The kitchen did him call in. 
She gorged him well with beef and ale, 
His smiles in joy did steep her, 
She yielded to the amorous tale 
Of the fancy, young barkeeper. 
Chorus—With love, etc. 
When Stoughton Bitters gained his ends, 
She said in tones affrighted, 
" 
You've me undone, so make amends 
And let us be united." 
He vowed he would, but then he told 
Her, that he could not keep her, 
She believed him, and gave all her gold 
To the fancy, young barkeeper. 
Chorus—With love, etc. 
THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT. 
When Stoughton Bitters got the cash, 
He for New Jersey started, 
With a 
peanut gal he cut a 
dash, 
And left her broken-hearted. 
His victim soon was put to bed, 
And nightly wasn't a 
sleeper, 
To think that she'd been done, ' tis said, 
By the fancy, young barkeeper. 
Chorus—With love, etc. 
That's the Way to 130 It.

I 
AM quite a

And through the town I 
dash on, 
Dressed from top to toe 
In the latest fashion. 
I'm a

As all of you must view it, 
Up to every move,— 
That's the way to do it. 
Chorus—Fol de rol, etc. 
The truth I 
will confess, 
I'm fond of stylish clothes, sir, 
And always like to dress 
Just as the fashion goes, sir.

Nothing equal to it, 
I'm bound to cut a

Up and down Broadway,

And when I

That's the way to do it. 
Chorus—Fol de rol, etc. 
Blooming tittering girls, 
Lord! how I 
love to see 'em 
Show their teeth like pearls 
At Barnum's Museum; 
Soon on one I

Quickly hand her through it, 
Show her all the sights,_ 
That's the way to do it. 
Chorus—Fol de rol, etc. 
Once while loitering there, 
For a 
lady waiting, 
I 
saw a 
maiden fair 
The " Greek Slave" imitating; 
As like the chiseled stone, 
So skillfully she drew it, 
I 
asked to see her borne,— 
That's the way to do it. 
Chorus—Fol de rol, etc. 
To every dodge I'm fly, 
For weeks before the races, 
Out of town am I, 
To watch the horses' paces;

On that I 
bet my tin,— 
That's tile way to do it. 
Chorus—Fol de rol, etc. 
So now .1

To close my ditty handy, 
So waiter hand me prime,

And just before I 'ye done, 
This toast I 
Will clap to it, 
Here's " The ladies every one !"— 
That's the way to do it. 
Chorus.—Fol de rol, etc,

SUNG BY TONY PASTOR. 
Am—" Whack row de dow." 
OF 
the hunIcy gals of 'seventy-six 
Our histories still ring, 
We all know how they helped the boys 
That fought 'gainst England's King; 
To help the cause they worked and toiled 
Each one to fear a 
stranger, 
And in defence of human rights 
They nobly braved each danger. 
Chorus—With a 
whack row de dow, 
The ladies all are hunky critters ! 
Whack row de dow, 
Though they wear the hoop de doo. 
That Congress setts they'd fill with grace 
Each husband Will allow, 
When petticoats have government 
We all of us must bow; 
As rulers, time still proves the fair 
Possess the greatest skill, oh, 
For, do or say what e'er we will, 
The ladies' rule us still, oh. 
Chorus—With a 
whack, etc. 
That well our ladies could our armies 
Lead, we all can see, 
For tell me who like women can 
Command the hVantry; 
10 
THE LADIES ARE ALL HUNKY CRITTERS. 
When she the breast-works carries, then 
To fight who could defer, 
There's not a 
man who wouldn't stand 
To live and die for her. 
Chorus—With a 
whack, etc. 
That greatly she'd the pulpit grace, 
It is as clear as day; 
For who'd not soar to virtue, when 
An angel leads the way; 
And that the bench she would adorn, 
I've said, and say again, 
For after all the ladies are 
Best judges of us men. 
Chorus—With our whack, etc. 
That they IT the best of counsellors 
Is clear to old and young, 
For how can woman fail when she 
Has got to use her tongue; 
And that they'd best of doctors prove, 
Is equally as sure, 
For where 's 
the ill in life, I 
ask, 
A 
lady cannot cure ? 
Chorus—With her whack, etc. 
As brewers and distillers, who 
Can doubt the ladies', merits, 
For who so like the ladies still, 
• Can put a 
man in spirits; 
That good upholsterers they'd be, 
I'll prove it in a 
minute, 
For no house can be furnished, 
if there 's 
not a 
lady in it. 
Chorus—With her whack, etc. 
ENCORE VERSES. 
As tailors to their merits, 
Every tailor still must bow, 
So well do they suit all mankind, 
As all men will allow; 
I'M GOING TO FIGHT MIT SIGEL . 
As smiths, each Smith the mastery 
Still yields unto his wife, 
For oh! the chains the ladies forge, 
Are chains that last for life. 
Chorus—With a 
whack, etc. 
That they'd make famous nursery-men, 
Our children fully prove; 
And were they but our gardeners. 
For tu-lips none would rove; 
Such flowers within themselves they'd be, 
They still would charm life's fever; 
Be balsam to our anguish too, 
And hearts- ease prove for ever. 
Chorus—With their whack, etc. 
And thus I 
think I've clearly proved 
The ladies all in all, 
And while we've them to aid us, 
Sure Columbia ne'er can fall, 
And ' tis my firm belief they might 
Soon bring men to that station, 
As to be merely used for to 
Keep up the population. 
Chorus—With their whack, etc.

Ant—" Annie Laurie." 
SHE has beauties without number, 
But her heart's as hard as stone, 
Though my love for her wont slumber, 
Sure she wont have me, och hone! 
She wont have me, och hone !— 
Though I 
know her purse is long, 
Yet, her scorn it adds fresh fuel 
To the love of Paddy Strong. 
I 
have tould her she's a 
cratur 
Too good to walk the earth; 
But I 
said not it was swater, 
Just to know her money's worth— 
To know her money's worth, 
For her fortune is my song, 
Sure the cash it is I'm wanting, 
Not herself, says Paddy Strong. 
Oh 
they tell me she's a 
widdy, 
That her husband sudden died, 
And advise me not to wed her, 
And I 
don't know what beside— 
I 
don't know what beside; 
But herself might not live long, 
Then, of course, her cash she'd lave me, 
Big thing for Paddy Strong.

WERRY MYSTERIOUS. 
It was enly 't 
other morning, 
Just a 
week or two ago, 
That I 
gave the cratur warning, 
How my love was so and so— 
My love was so and so; 
But she thought I 
acted wrong, 
Then she said I'd best be moving,— 
What a 
blow for Paddy Strong! 
I'll go and talk unceasing, 
But the divil a 
word I'll spake, 
For my love is fast increasing 
For her cash, and no mistake— 
Her cash, and no mistake, 
Love-letters I've sent, a 
throng; 
But just like many 
'others, 
I 
can't write, says Paddy Strong. 
I'm great in form and figure, 
Barring I'm but four foot two, 
I'm fair as any nigger, 
With a 
squinting eye to view— 
A 
squinting eye to view; 
But good luck I'll be among, 
For I'll coax and taize the widdy, 
Till I 
make her Mrs. Strong.

15 
I 
once was so happy, beset by no sorrow, 
I 
laughed, danced, and chatted, nor cared for to-morrow, 
But how soon I 
was changed when I 
met with Miss Fearis, 
There was something about her so werry mysterious. 
SPOKEN—Werry mysterious: werry mysterious and 
singular, indeed. I 
can't prezactly describe 
it, but 
There was something about her, etc. 
I 
met her one day in the Central Park, 
She was walkinc, along with a 
dashing young spark, 
her dress of pink muslin so daintily made, 
Declared her to be a 
dress-maker by trade. 
Her looks I 
shall never forget any more, 
Like lightning they shot to my very heart's core, 
She gave me a 
card with the name of Miss Fearis 
By jingo, thinks I, this is werry mysterious. 
SPOKEN—W ell, it was werry mysterious to think of me 
cutting out the fancy chap she was a 
7alking 
with. 
Oh, the sweet glance she gave me ! I 
wilted right down into my boots, and I 
was 
up to snuff, and sound on the goose. 
I 
couldn't help thinking 'twas werry, etc. 
My heart was so filled up with joy and delight, 
The thoughts of her kept me awake all the night, 
Next morning quite early with spirits I 
rose, 
And dressed myself smart in my best suit of clothes. 
Before her shop door all the day I 
did stroll, 
Love burnt in my breast like a 
furnace of coal; 
But not e'en a 
glimpse did I 
catch of Miss Fearis, 
Which I 
couldn't help thinking was werry mysterious. 
SPOKEN—Werry mysterious, indeed! 
After thinking 
I 
had such a 
big thing on ice; walking all 
day till my teeth chattered and my toe-nails 
cracked with the cold, and I 
was as hoarse 
as a 
hop-toad with the asthma. 
Of course— 
I 
couldn't help thinking, etc. 
16 
WEBBY MYSTERIOUS. 
The next day Miss Fearis I 
happened to meet, 
While brimful of thoughts, walking through Chatham Street, 
Zhe curtsied so sweet, and said, " How d'you do?" 
That I 
felt like a " hunky boy" then, wouldn't you ? 
Then we walked up the Bowery to purchase some collars, 
And I 
bought her a 
necklace, which cost me ten dollars; 
At parting she kissed me, did pretty Miss Fearis, 
Yet something about her was werry mysterious. 
SPOKEN—Yes, there was a 
sort of a 
kind of a 
half smile, 
three parts grin, in the manner in which she 
thanked me for the necklace, as she said, in 
the words of Byron, " Bully for you, Johnny. 
You're a 
pertty little boy, with a 
bully glass 
eye, a wooden nose and a 
copper coffee-
grinder." 
Still it rayther struck me that 
There was something, etc 
Next day I 
did call at her house; but, how queer, 
I 
found she was married to a 
gay gainho-lier. 
I 
began to upbraid her, the bard-hearted jade, 
But, I 
ne'er will forget the vile trick that she played. 
In a 
werry large cistern, quite up to my chin, 
I 
was soused till completely wet through to my skin, 
While the gay gam-bo-lier that had charge of Miss Fearis, 
Cried, " Duck him again!" 
Now, 'twas werry mysterious. 
SPOKEN—There was a 
cooler. 
After buying her a 
ten. 
dollar necklace, to shiver my warm spirits in 
cold water, soused like a 
pig's foot. 
Miss 
Fearis laughed. 
It was fun to her, but the 
point was invisible to me. 
In fact, I 
can't 
bear.to eat, sleep, drink, or make water ever 
since. 
Such conduct, in my opinion,— 
There was something, etc. 
I 
feebly crept home, filled with aches and with pain, 
Confined to my room I 
was six months insane, 
Talked of nothing but blankets and pretty Miss Fearis, 
Which all my attendants thought werry mysterious.

LA.NIGAN'S BALL.

I 
walks about weeping the 
I 
never complain, but 
But I 
met her last 
o 
be gay, 
whole of the day, 
ye grown werry serious, 
night, it was werry mysterious. 
SPOKEN— Last night to ease my 
grief I 
took a 
walk out. 
I 
went into a 
basement in Broadway where 
there were waiter gals. 
One of the wirgins 
dropped in my lap, and, in a 
familiar woice, 
asked, " How are you, Johnny ?" Great Hey-
ings! it was the dientical Miss Fearis. 
The 
gay, young garnbolier was made brigadier-
general of a 
division of stone-breakers on 
Blackwell's Island. 
Miss Fearis was con-
verted, joined Henry Screeeher's conglom-
eration, read Cock Robin and other good 
books, and carried lager bier to thirsty souls. 
Her perversion was wonderful. 
But still, her behavior was werry mysterious, etc.

LANIGAN'S BALL. 
'Twas myself had free invitations 
For all the boys and girls I 
might ask, 
In less than five minutes I'd frinds and relations, 
Singing as merry as flies round a

Jenny O'Hara, a

Tipt me the wink and asked me to call, 
Whin I 
arrived with Timothy Gilligan, 
Just in time for Lanigan's ball. 
Dance—Whack, fal lal, etc. 
Whin we got there they were dancing the polka, 
All round the room in a 
quare whinigig; 
But Jenny and I 
put a 
stop to this nonsense, 
We tip't thitn a 
taste of a 
nate Irish jig. 
Oh ! Mavrone, wasn't she proud o' ne; 
We " batthered the flure" till the ceiling did fall, 
For I 
spent three weeks at Brooks's Academy, 
Laming a 
step for Lanigan's ball. 
Dance—Whack, fal lal, etc. 
The boys were all merry, the girls all frisky, 
Drinking too-ether in couples and groups, 
Whin an accident happened to Paddy O'Rafferty, 
He stuck his right fitt through Miss Flanigan's hoops; 
The craythur she fainted and roared " millia murther !" 
Called for her hinds, and gathered them all, 
Tim Dermody swore that he'd go no further, 
But he'd have satisfaction at Lanigan's ball.

Dance—Whack, fal lal, etc. 
Och ! arrah, boys, but then was the ructions, 
Myself got .a 
wallop from Phelim .McCod, 
Soon I 
replied to his nate introduction, 
And we kicked up the divil's own phillilaloo. 
Casey the piper, he was nearly strangled, 
They squeezed up his bags, chaunter's and all; 
The girls in their ribbons, all got entangled, 
And that put a 
stop to Lanigan's ball. 
Dance—Whack, fal, lal, etc. 
RAGGED MAN WITH THE SOAP-FAT CAN.

The Ragged. Man. with the Soap-
rat Can. 
Sung by J. 
C. 
STEWART. 
Chctunting Benny;" or " The Album." 
No doubt you've heard of ragged Joe, 
A 
gentleman, and all that; 
You've heard of me afore, I 
know— 
Or heard me call for soap-fat. 
My pedigree aint very long, 
Although there's plenty in it, 
And if you listen to my song, 
Of course I 
will begin it. 
Chorus—You may have met me in the street, 
Or at your houses calling, 
Perhaps you've heard my voice so sweet, 
When " soap-fat 1" I 
am bawling. 
At six years old I 
went to school 
And got my education, 
My master said " Unto a 
fool 
I 
was a 
near relation ; " 
He said my fate might be like his'n, 
Though I 
could scarcely hope that, 
I 
might go to congress or to prison, 
Or else might carry soap-fat. 
Chorus—You may, etc. 
But when I 
got the college through, 
And all its high resources, 
I 
started up fifth avenue, 
And went to holding horses; 
But there one day I 
had a 
muss 
With Mr. Brooks's flunky, 
Then, as I 
was such a 
funny cuss, 
Barnum hired me for a 
monkey 
Chorus—You may, etc.

WONDERFUL MARCH OF INTELLECT. 
Next I 
went to blacking boots, 
My stand was in the park sir, 
My customers I 
always suits, 
Pd shine them like a 
spark sir; 
That business I 
made it pay, 
So quite a 
pile it made me, 
But I 
blackened Greeley's boots one day, 
And I'll swear he never paid me. 
Chorus— You may, etc. 
And now the soap-fat trade I 
tries, 
The best I 
ever took to, 
May every jolly cook e'er thrive, 
For it's them I 
have to look to; 
And soon I 
feel I'll be i 
luck, 
A 
comfort there's in that man, 
I 
know some day a 
handsome cook 
Will marry the soap-fat man. 
Chorus—You may, etc.

The Wonderful March or Intel-
lect. 
NEW VERSION. BY I. F. POOLE, 
Ant—"Jeremy Diddler." 
NEW Vont( is a 
wonderful place, 
Such schemes are daily arising, 
Each artist is running a 
race, 
To astound us with feats enterprising; 
To be sure it has ruined a 
few, 
But this you'll be just pleased to recollect, 
'Tis what we might judge would pursue— 
Such a 
wonderful march of intellect 
Of course you must own that is so, 
In this wonderful age of intellect. 
WONDERFUL MARCH OF INTELLECT. 
21 
A 
proposal we lately have had, 
The darkies to move from their station, 
South America they'd populate, 
And form a 
new African nation ; • 
But the " greasers," you know, heard the news, 
To have the" mokes" there they did object, 
And so the whole plan bursted up— 
Oh! wonderful march of intellect. 
Cho.—Of course, etc. 
To walk now some are not content, 
In balloons they must mount like a 
rocket, 
So if breaking their necks they prevent, 
They at least break a 
hole in their pocket. 
The opera is now quite the rage, 
High- scented Italians we so respect ; 
" 
Old Hundred" is behind the age— 
Oh 1 
wonderful march of intellect. 
Cho.—Of course, etc. 
Our forefathers boasted with pride, 
That Shakespeare's works would enlighten us; 
But with horrors we're now horrified, 
So that even the spirits won't frighten us. 
Dictionaries all are now let slip, 
Our phrases are how, if I 
recollect— 
" 
Over the left," " Let her rip,"— 
Oh 1 
wonderful march of intellect. 
Cho.—Of course, etc. 
" 
That's what's the matter," " Played out," [man 
"Be a 
brick," and " How is your grandmother ?" 
" 
I 
don't see it," "A 
big thing on ice," 
" 
How are you, Judge ?" " Or any other man." 
" 
Skedaddle," " Spondulicks," " Vamose," 
All this I 
suppose now is quite correct; 
But they weren't in use long amo— 
Oh wonderful march of intellect. 
Cho.—Of course, etc.

Just to knock out your eye or you tooth—

An Ethiopian Stump Speech. 
By J. F. Poo. 
Delivered, with tremendous applause, 1.iy H. W. EAGAN, Ethiopian 
Comedian. 
FELLOW-HEARERS and heareresses, having being squilic-
hated by some of de principal members of dat " nine hun-
dred thousand" to lecture before you dig evening, I 
have 
been industriously conglomerating a 
hypersquilateral col. 
lection of approbious and useful notes and tings, but, my 
beloved woodchucks, I 
stopped at a 
Hungarian lager bier 
saloon, to recuperate my culinary physiology wid a 
glass 
of dat salubrious beverage, and while I 
was investigating 
de—de—consorts of de institution I 
left my notes and tings 
on a 
head of cabbage. 
What was de squences? Why, a 
gentle maiden, of forty years, sneaked off cabbage, notes, 
and all, and in less dan free seconds it was chopped up into 
sour-krout, filling de combustible regions of some Dutch-
man's segastric metambphis.

When Kit Carson drove his 
apple-cart across de Alps on his way to de ever effiuverous 
stickamores of Jerusalem, for de purpose of planting Brig-
ham Young in Salt River, does you suppose dat if Monitor 
had built de Ericson, dat de Peruvians would ever have 
gained entrance to de fore and aft steamer Mayflower, when 
it took de pilgrimages and deli' families across de desert 
plains of New Jersey, and landed dem safe in Gowanus 
Creek? 
Certainly not; for, as Games Jordan Bennet ex-
claimed when he attacked John Heenan's masked battery, 
On doughnuts now dey've placed de taxes, 
Two cents a-piece is de price dey axes.

Cromwell had stopped at Delmonico's to have a

Old Erin's Own S_hillelalt. 
Sung by Fred. May. 
Ant—" The Shamrock." 
FROM brick and tile 
To rest awhile 
As Mike and Phelim wandered, 
With Pat the wight, 
Who said, " Ere night 
Our dollars shall be squandered." 
Now as they pass 
.3ily bog of grass, 
OLD ERIN'S OWN SHILLELAIL 
They see its worth the picking • 
Like ladle seen 
In soup tureen, 
A 
nate shillelah sticking. 
Chorus. 
Och! the shillelah, 
That magic wand, shillelah, 
'Twixt man and wife 
It ends all strife, 
Old Erin's own shillelah. 
Says Phelim, " See, 
That sprig's for me, 
That lies by yonder turning," 
Says Mike, " no, no, 
It's for us two, 
We'll cut it up for burning." 
But Paddy craves 
Their couple of laves, 
And cries, " Och ! don't it sever, 
It's for each one, 
So for 't 
we'll run." 
(Now for it. 
Wan, two, three, and the divil take the 
hindmost, hurroo 
Och, Paddy, now or never. 
Chorus—To the shillelah, etc. 
Away they ran, 
And every one 
Seized hold of it together. 
They pull'd and lick'd, 
And swore and kick'd 
The toes off their shoe leather. 
But Paddy's kick 
Got him the stick, 
THE MARRIED MAN. 
And 'cause the others whimpered, 
lie bate thim so 
lie brought thim to, 
And made thim both good-timpered. 
Chorus—With the shillelah, etc. 
Says Paddy, " ye 
Do all agree 
This cudgel is my earning I" 
Says Mike, " we know 
It's your's, and so 
This whiskey- shop we'll turn in," 
And there the knaves 
'Went singing staves, 
Whose burden was " Ne'er shiver, 
A 
stick that tends 
To make air friends, 
Mike, Phelim, Pat, forever I" 
Chorus—Oeh the shillelah, etc. 
The Married Man— 
AIR—' The Goose hangs high." 
Tuts life we know is mostly blanks, though some may get 
a 
prize, 
And this you know whate'er our rank, we think ourselves 
most wise; 
Now, some are scared to take a 
wife, I'll prove it if I 
can, 
The greatest blessing in this life, is to be a 
married man. 
Now, I 
was single once myself, and out at nights did roam, 
And then with others spent my cash, and pennyless went 
home; 
Next morn my head was aching so, for my bitters off I 
ran, 
And it was best, I 
soon found out, to be a 
married man. 
And if so be a 
house you keep, and get romping with the 
maid, 
And when a 
few months on do creep, you begin to feel 
afraid; 
NEW PATENT SONG ON THE NEW PATENTS.

A 
young'un you expect she'll bring, that often is their plan, 
But that sort of thing, it seldom happens to a 
married man. 
If single, you should get in debt, you're bothered every way, 
And if they get you into court, they're bound to make you 
Pay; 
But if about your wife you speak, make an excuse you can, 
And then they quick " let up" on you, 'cause you're a 
mar-
ried man. 
My moral, now, is this, you see, if you're inclined to roam, 
To keep from troubles ever free, you'd better stay at home; 
To single men take, take my advice, avoid each snare and 
plan, 
If after a " big thing on ice," go be a 
married man.

By turns have had their day, sir; 
No wonder then in this great town,

When art and genius are combined, 
And patents are the rage, sir. 
Chorus—Yes, sir-ree, 
It is the age of patents now;

In mentioning the various arts, 
You'll think I'm singing changes, 
We've patent stoves and patent grates, 
And patent kitchen ranges. 
Chorus.— Yes, sir-ree. 
We've patent guns of every kind, 
Patent balls and patent powder, 
Patent lightning on the telegraph, 
And patent pots for chowder;

And though they may not like the job 
To stop domestic Wrangle, 
The men may get the washing up 
With patent mill and mangle. 
Chorus—Yes, sir-ree. 
We've patent busts and patent teeth, 
And patent bustle's big, sir, 
With patent curls and patent hair, 
And patent ladies' wig, sir; 
Wt've patent urns and patent churns, 
Patent lamps, and that aint all, sir, 
They've got a

For making codfish balls, sir,

In a

And then to finish up the job, 
Aint it a 
funny caper ? 
The patent Gayetty steps in. 
And gives us patent paper. 
Chorus—Yes, sir-ree, etc. 
There's patent physic for the sick. 
Though some will be found scoffing, 
And die just to enjoy the sweets 
Of a

A PARODY ON " 
The Gipse,y King." 
'Tis I 
am the tinker Joe, 
And where is there one like me ? 
If your saucepans are only so, so, 
And your kettle won't make your tea. 
In my tent there is never a 
table, 
And our furniture's rather queer; 
But I 
eat of the best, when I 
am able, 
Or puts up with bacon and beer— 
Chorus—And there's nothing like tinkering, 
Hal. ha! 
A 
tinker and gipsey am I, 
I 
don't pay, for that makes things dear, 
And honesty's all my eye; 
For you find rogues everywhere. 
Of police I 
am never in dread, 
For I'm not such an ignorant fool 
As to prig before all are in bed, • 
Which you'll own is an excellent rule. 
Chorus—And there's nothing like tinkering, 
Ha I 
ha! 
I 
confess I'm a 
handsome man, 
Though 
soiled with the smoke, I 
know ; 
And I'm fond of my glass and my can, 
And a 
pipe—though that's rather low.

My tent has got many a

And I

And in summer I

Chorus—For there's nothing like tinkering, 
Ha! ha! 
With my tinkering life I'm content, 
While I 
have enough to eat, 
And I 
wouldn't give a 
red cent, 
In Congress to have a

No governor's chair I

IF 
you've never IP-mrd tell of Frederick Brown, 
Come listen unto me— 
He was the wonder of the town, 
Such a 
wonderful man was he. 
Mister Brown he was so very strong, 
Upon my word 'its true, 
He could carry a 
tree nineteen feet long, 
As if lwere nothing to do. 
Chorus—Then go it Mister Brown, 
You know you're mighty strong, 
If other folks can take you down, 
Why don't they come along. 
He all at once resolved to go 
As a 
soldier out to fight; 
To pulverize the boasting foe, 
Then blow their dust from sight; 
MR. BROWN THE ASTONISHING. 
Then with him he took such a 
sword, 
He could such great things do, 
So a 
regiment without a 
word, 
Like larks he spitted through. 
Chorus—Then go it, etc. 
In the midst of the fight, a 
cannon ball 
Came whizzing o'er the plain, 
He caught it, and without letting it fall, 
He threw it back again. 
The enemy were sore afraid, 
And all began to run; 
But this cannon ball such havoc made, 
It killed them every one. 
Chorus—Then go it, etc. 
He was, indeed, a 
wonderful man, 
To sea he took a 
trip; 
But so very high the wild waves ran, 
They soon capsized the ship, 
But, bless you, this was naught to him, 
A 
trifle and no more, 
For like a 
fish this man did swim, 
Twelve hundred miles to shore. 
Chorus—Then go it, etc. 
He mesmerism knew so well, 
Its effects he oft would try, 
Once touching- an oyster on the shell, 
He made the oyster fly; 
Right round the world this oyster fled, 
You may depend upon it, 
And what is more, ' tis truly said, 
With Mr. Brown stuck on it. 
Chorus—Then go it, etc. 
Such a 
large segar he used to puff, 
'Twas like a 
timber log, 
Indeed he once made smoke enough, 
To wrap the world in a 
fog; 
HANS DIETCHKRAPPENHIETER . 
The folks begged hard he would retire, 
Such fright they had endured; 
But to ease their minds, against a 
fire 
He had the world insured. 
Chorus—Then go it, etc. 
Now Mister Brown could sing a 
song, 
With a 
tune enchanting quite, 
That would take you full a 
fortnight long 
To sing it, day and night; 
But then he had a 
voice so clear, 
Crack singers he'd defy, 
His .upper notes you'd plainly hear, 
Though he pitched 'em ten miles nigh. 
Chorus—Then go it, etc. 
This clever Tan could dance so well, 
And that so very light, 
You may believe me when I 
tell, 
He once jumped out of sight; 
Just at that time, beneath the sky 
There sailed a 
large balloon, 
He stopped the car, bid them " good night," 
Then jumped into the moon. 
Chorus—Then go it, etc.

Ain—",Toe Bowers." 
'Twas in a 
street, on the edit side, in this big town of ours, 
A 
maiden fair did long reside, her name was Kitty Bowers, 
The sweets of life had long been her's, but soon she felt its 
sours, 
For love approached, quite unawares, and wounded Kitty 
Bowers. 
The baker who the dinner baked and brought at stated hours, 
Was not aware how throbbed and ached the heart of Kitty 
Bowers. 
But chatty quite he soon became and talked of Hymen's 
powers 
In flowery words, which did inflame the breast of Kitty 
Bowers.

JOE BOWERS' SISTER KITTY. 
On Sunday out to Jones' Wood, her bonnet trimmed with 
flowers, 
With the baker, drinking lager bier, the lovely Kitty Bowers, 
The fluids there quite strong did prove, delightful pass'd 
the hours, 
For the baker talked all day of love, and so did Kitty Bowers. 
But rivals oft block up love's road, of different size and 
powers, 
And a 
gardener, living away up town, he wanted Kitty 
Bowers. 
Oft at her window he would stand with pots. of fragrant 
flowers, 
And all he wished for was the hand, he said, of Kitty Bowers. 
At length, the rivals they did meet and fought one day for 
hours, 
But the baker being bravest beat, and claimed sweet Kitty 
Bowers; 
The gardener took it so to heart he lost both speech and 
powers, 
And soon with death he did depart, through grief of Kitty 
Bowers. 
Now to church as they walked arm-in-arm, the rain came 
oF 
down in showers, 
And the darkness greatly did alarm the timid Kitty Bowers, 
And as the churchyard they walked through the clock 
struck out twelve hours, 
When the gardener, dressed in apron blue, appeared to 
Kitty Bowers. 
" 
False girl," says he, " you thought me dead, and passed 
with joy your hours, 
But this night to deck my bridal bed, I'll have you, Kitty 
Bowers." 
Then fast he seized her by the arm with more than mortal 
powers, 
And the rain and him were quickly gone, and so was Kitty 
Bowers.,

DON'T POKE YOUR SNOUT IN A FAMILY QUARREL. 37 
The baker backwards fell with fright in a 
grave scarce dug 
' 
three hours, 
And the people thought he was quite right to follow Kitty 
Bowers. 
His baking-3 
brown, he baked no more, nor dealt again in 
flowers, 
And that's the last of the gardener, the baker, and Kitty 
Bowers.

COMIC SONG WITH A 
MORAL. 
Ant—"Landlady of France," or "lionitor and Merrimac. 
Mn. BOURNE and his wife, 
At breakfast had a 
strife, 
He wanted bread and butter with his tea, tea, tea; 
Says she " I'll rule the roast, 
I 
will have a 
plate of toast ! " 
So then to loggerheads with him went she, she, she. 
Now there was one Mr. Moore 
Who lived on the first floor, 
This man was very strong in the wrist, wrist, wrist ; 
Heioverheard the clatter 
About the bread and butter, 
So he knocked down Mr. Bourne with his fist, fist, fist. 
Says he, " upon my life, 
You shall not b-at your wife, 
For that is both a 
sin and a 
disgrace, grace, grace ; " 
" 
You fool," says Mrs. Bourne, 
" 
It's no business of your'n," 
And threw a 
cup of tea smack in his face, face, face. 
Cried poor Mr. Moore, 
'As he started for the door, 
"I surely am a 
man without brains, brains, brains; 
When two married folks are flouting, 
If a 
stranger pokes his snout in, 
He's sure to get it tweak'd for his pains, pains, pains.

Gobble O'G-obble and the Elogs. 
AIR—"Lord Lovel." 
ONE Gobble O'Gobble of eating renown, 
Bolted pork so remarkably fast, 
That where'er in his buggy he travelled from town. 
Oh! he longed for each pig that he passed. 
Passed, passed, passed, etc. 
To Ohio he travelled in love with the name, 
Where he found them as merry as gigs, 
At the sign of the hog, and of infinite fame 
For dishing up young sucking pigs. 
The bill of fare couldn't boast a 
pig or pork pie, 
Which enraged this swine-eatinc, sinner, 
Till the waiter said, " Sir, we've thirteen in the stye, 
And the fattest we'll cook for your dinner." 
" 
Lay the cloth, then in haste, I 
shall stay for a 
week, 
And dine in this room, if not taken; 
For then I 
can hear the pigs' musical squeak, 
Though their squeaking will not save their bacon." 
Thus day after day the poor pigs went to pot, 
Till he'd bolted a 
dozen or more; 
And whene'er he was asked what for dinner he'd got— 
"Why a 
dear little pig to be sure." 
Once more be was roused by a 
terrible cry, 
John answered the bell that had rung, 
And informed him that all the old pigs in the stye. 
Were enraged at his eating their young. 
" 
Whv then my fine fellow to end all this row, 
And finally settle the squall; 
So order the butcher to stick the old sow," 
So he paid for and gobbled them all. 
In Ohio the hogs all signed a 
petition, 
And stuck it on every stye, 
Which the sapient pig of learned tradition, 
Explained as hR chanced to ride by.

" 
Oh, shame !" he exclaimed, with grunt and with squeaks, 
" 
Gobble O'Gobble's conduct 's 
unkind; 
And if ever a 
spice of my knowledge he seeks, 
I'll be d—d 
but I'll tell him my mind."

A 
COMIC RECITATION. 
JACK OAKnAM was a 
seaman good, 
As ever stood to gun ; 
And when on shore was always first, 
To join a 
bit of fun. 
One night, as on the dock he strolled, 
A 
play bill caught his eye, 
By which " The Tempest" was announced 
In letters three feet high. 
Jack, though he'd never seen a 
play, 
To join the folks was willing, 
So straight he mounted up aloft, 
For which he paid a 
shilling. 
The curtain rose, the play commenced 
With thunder, lightning, rain, 
The vessel, with a 
horrid crash, 
Was instant sent in twain. 
That moment all the gallery props 
Gave way in sullen fit, 
And showered down the motley crew 
Right headlong in the pit, 
Says Jack, " If this be play, my lads, 
By Jove, I'll instant strike it; 
It may be fun for aught I 
know, 
But dam'me if I 
like it.

Next year Jack again arrived 
To make a 
few weeks' stay, 
And to the " Bowery" then he strolled— 
" 
The Tempest" was the play. 
But slily in the pit he got, 
Retnemb'ring former folly, 
And far removed from danger's shore, 
Determined to be jolly. 
Soon as the well-known scene began, 
And lightnings rent the skies, 
lie twisted round with cunning leer, 
And upwards turned his eyes.

Hold hard aloft, you jolly dogs,

Mind what you're at you shilling swabs, 
For here you come my hearties."

He was a 
queer old gentleman, 
lie never could get fat. 
At breukfast every morn, 'tis said, at truth I

He'd eat a 
dozen loaves of bread, soaked in a 
little liquor; 
Of coffee gallons three he'd drink, as I'm a 
living sinner, 
And yet, in spite of all he ate, he still kept getting thinner. 
He was, etc. 
At luncheon, he could eat, they-say, a 
half a 
dozen geese 
And turkeys ten, which only made his appetite increase; 
He'd drink a 
gallon down of ale, eat berad and cheese at 
leisure, 
Then of tobacco smoke a 
pound, and think it only pleaaure. 
And yet this queer, etc.

And then at dinner, if he could, he'd have them placed 
close by, 
A 
two ton apple dumpling and a

glutton, 
In a 
twinkling they would disappear, with a 
dozen legs of 
mutton. 
For he was, etc. 
And then at tea time eat he could, and there is no denying, 
Of buckwheat cakes a 
hundred while the ham and eggs 
were frying; 
Six dozen eggs beside the ham, it all went down his throttle, 
And after he had eat all that, of wine he'd drink six bottles. 
He was, etc. 
At supper, when the time was near, you'd think his maw 
was sated, 
At pies and puddings he'd to work, as if he had not tasted; 
And then when he had eat up all he'd look so very queer, 
And cry aloud he wanted more and a 
keg or two of beer. 
He was, etc. 
So then, to make them some amends, he'd stumble off to bed, 
And there he'd lie for seven years, you'd think that he was

If ever he wakes up again, he never will get fat.

Spoken—As a

Says he, " Ned sticks at nought but sheep, and I'll soon

My maxim '6 
a

Indeed, if it's followed, it never will fail:

May all be so over a

Fol de rol lol, etc. 
The man who is rich, and his money 
a 
trouble, 
Never let it perplex him what with it to do; 
Assist those in want, whether single or double, 
And get a 
good name, though it be from a 
few. 
Take care of enough for yourself and another, 
That you may enjoy yourself telling the tale 
Of the good you have done for a 
friend and a 
brother, 
And still have enough for a 
mug of old ale. 
Fol de rol lol, etc. 
The man that is poor and must work for his living, 
And fortune should frown on him day after day, 
has always a 
friend that has something to give him 
To soften his mind and drive sorrow away. 
Let pride never prove himself for you too many, 
Nor prejudice deep in your bosom prevail; 
But if you should chance for to fall out with any 
Why, make it up over a 
mug of old ale. 
Fol de rol 101, etc. 
The man that is married is sure to be happy, 
Because his companion is with him for life; 
Ho can hoax her and coax her with her take his nappy, 
And by his good policy keep away strife. 
If she should be jealous, then he should be zealous, 
And fondle as often as e'er she may rail; 
Or when she 's 
inclined to be kind and concessions, 
Why, give her a 
share of your mug of old ale. 
Fol de rol lol, etc. 
A 
man that is single can always be jolly, 
With social companions he always can join; 
With all sorts of mirth he can drown melancholy, 
Or if he is rich, he can tipple his wine;

Then you that are married, and you that are single, 
And you that are wealthy and you that are poor, 
The younger or older, wherever you mingle, 
Your maxim must be, " keep the wolf from the door.'

He is happy indeed, if he goes to bed mellow,

Nor could he guess what thoughts of him 
Were to her bosom flocking, 
As her fair fingers swift and slim, 
Flew round and round the stocking. 
While, as for Joshua, bashful youth, 
, His words grew few, and fewer; 
Though all the time, to tell the truth, 
His chair edged nearer to her. 
Did Josh-u-a, did Josh-u-a.

Meantime, her ball of yarn gave out, 
She knit so fast and steady; 
And he must give his aid, no doubt, 
To get another ready. 
He held the skein—of course, the thread 
Got tangled, snarled and twisted; 
"have patience!" cried the artless maid 
To him, who her assisted. 
To Josh-u-a, to Josh-u-a.

A_ Drop or Good Whiskey. 
Sung by J. CONNER, Comedian and Comic Vocalist. 
AIR—" Gee ho, Dobbin." 
A 
DROP of good whiskey will make you glad. 
Too much of the creature will drive you mad, 
If you take it in reason, 'twill make, you wise, 
If you drink to excess it will close up your eyes. 
Yet father and mother, 
And sister and brother, 
They all take a 
sup in their turn. 
Some preachers will tell you to drink is bad, 
I 
think so too—if there's none to be had. 
Maine Law men will tell you to drink none at all, 
But while I 
can get it—a 
fig for them all. 
Both layman and brother 
In spite of this bother, 
Will all take a 
sup in their turn. 
Some doctors will tell you 'twill hurt your health, 
And justice will say 'twill reduce your wealth ; 
Physicians and lawyers do both agree, 
When your money's all gone they can get no fee. 
Yet doctor and lawyer, 
And mason and sawyer 
Will all take a 
sup in their turn. 
The Quakers will bid you from drink abstain, 
By yea and by nay, 'tis a 
fault in the vein; 
DER LAGER BIER. 
63 
Yet some of the broad-brims will get to the stuff, 
And tipple away till they've guzzled enough. 
For preacher and spouter, 
And temperance shouter 
Will all take a 
sup in their turn. 
The Qermans, they say, they can drink the most, 
The French and John Bullies also do boast; 
But Hibernia's the country (for all the noise,) 
For generous drinking and hearty boys. 
There each jovial fellow 
Will drink till he's mellow, 
And toss off his drop in his turn.

I 'd

jackass, born in a 
shed 
Where clover, and thistles, and oats often meet ; 
Rolling all day on a clean straw bed, 
And kicking all pigs that wished with me to eat.

never sigh for potatoes or wheat; 
But I 'd 
be a 
jackass, born in a 
shed, 
Kissing all pigs that are pretty and sweet. 
Oh! could I 
pilfer the wand of a fairy, 
Two pair of pretty swift legs I would have; 
My summer days rambles should be free and airy, 
And I'd sleep upon hay, while the owls hoot so bravo. 
Th.se who drag burdens are tired and weary, 
Lazy ones nought but a 
good beating get; 
I'd be a 
jackass, and nothing should scare me, 
Rolled up in hay, I'd be merry, you bet. 
TIIE PLAGUE OF ALL PLAGUES .

What though you tell me you're free and in clover 
After you've toiled through a bleak autumn day; 
Surely, ' tis better to be a gay rover, 
To kick up your heel's and to gallop away. 
Some through the winter may slave till 'tis over, 
And live upon stubble, a

And when I'd get mad, raise the devil to pay.

Both high and low the same; 
And thee, despite thine honors fair,

Ne'er till the last trump calls thee out, 
Poor John shalt thou arise; 
But like the diamond clothed in light, 
Thy soul shall seek the skies. 
The Iilliii 
of Time. 
A BACCHANALIAN SONG. 
AIR—".Down, Derry, Down." 
ONE evening Good Humor took Wit as his guest, 
Resolved to indulge in a 
sensible feast; 
Their liquor was claret, an_i Friendship their host, 
And Mirth, Song and Sentiment garnished each toast. 
Derry down, down, 
Let the claret go down.

THE KILLING OF' 
TIME. 
But while, like true bucks, they enjoyed their design, 
For the joy of a 
buck lies in love, wit and wine; 
Alarmed they all heard at the door a 
loud knock, 
And the watchman hoarse bellow'd "'Tis past twelve 
o'clock !" 
Derry down, etc. 
They nimbly ran down, the disturbing dog found, 
And up stairs they dragged the impertinent hound; 
When brought to the light, how much they were pleased 
To see 'twas the grey glutton, Time, they had seized. 
Derry down, etc. 
His glass as his lantern, his scythe as his pole, 
And his single lock dangled a- down his smooth skull; 
" 
My friends," quoth he, coughing, " I 
thought fit to knock, 
And bid ye be gone, for 'tis past twelve o'clock." 
Derry down, etc. 
Said the venom- toothed sage, " On this advice fix: 
Tho' Nature strikes twelve, Folly still points to six ;" 
He longer had preached, but no longer they'd bear it, 
So they hid him at once in a 
hogshead of claret. 
Derry down, etc. 
" 
This is right ;" called out Wit, " while you're yet in your 
prime, 
There's nothing like claret for killing of Time." 
" 
Huzza!" replied Love, " now no more he can knock, 
Or, impertinent, tell us, "Tis past twelve o'clock!'" 
Derry down, etc. 
Since Time is confined to our wine, let us think 
By this maxim we 're sure of our Time when we drink ; 
With bumpers, my lads, let our glasses be primed 
Now we're certain our drinking is always well timed. 
Derry down, etc.

Last night I 
went to meetither, 
With true love I 
did greet her, 
When in she looks at a 
pastry- cook's, 
And wanted me to treat her. 
Oh, yes, she did, 
indeed, she did! 
Ri tol lol, etc. 
At this I 
felt quite funny, 
Says, " My charming honey, 
I've lots of love, which you can prove, 
But, lord! I've got no money; 
Oh, no, I 
ain't, 
I'm sure I 
ain't !" 
Ri tol lol, etc. 
Says she, " Young man, 'tis plain sir, 
Your love is all in vain, sir; 
Unless you've cash to cut a 
dash, 
My heart you ne'er will gain, sir; 
Oh, no, you won't, 
I'll bet you won't I"

A ROW WITH MY SWEETHEART. 
I 
shocked was when I 
heard her; 
Says I, " Don't go no further, 
You surely will with coldness kill, 
And you'll be hanged for murder, 
Of course, you will, 
I 
hope you will?" 
Ri tol lol, etc. 
Says she, " You're not the thing, sir, 
l've got you on a 
string sir; • 
Get rid of hope— go, buy a 
rope, 
And give yourself a 
swing, sir." 
That's what she said, 
Indeed, she did! 
Ri tol lol, etc. 
The tears in my eyes started, 
I 
felt quite broken-hearted; 
I 
sighed a 
sigh, she blacked my eye, 
And that's,the way we parted. 
Oh, yes, we did, 
That's what we did! 
Ri tol lol, etc.
