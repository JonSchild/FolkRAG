LIZ CARROLL
 
Irish traditional music has been an important thread in
 
America's artistic fabric since the immigration of an
 
estimated seven million Irish fleeing famine,  poverty,  and
 
oppression in the mid and late 19th century.
 Irish musicians
 
from remote villages in the old country met and exchanged
 
ideas and regional repertoires and styles.
 New,  urban,  Irish
 
"villages"  took shape in places like Chicago and the Bronx in
 
which Irish fiddlers,  pipers,  flutists,  harpists,  and the
 
like,  enjoyed a lively,  creative musical ambience.
 While the
 
first Irish recordings were made in New York,  the "bi bl e"  of
 
Irish tunes appeared in Chicago in 1903,  an enormous  (
still
 
the largest anywhere)  compilation by Chicago's Chief
 
Superintendent of Police,  Francis O' Neill.
 It was said that
 
O' Neill had an open job offer on the police force for any good
 
fiddler or piper.
 In the mid-1900s,  this older-style Irish
 
music with its ancient Gaelic ballads and vast instrumental
 
repertoire was falling increasingly into disfavor,  edged out
 
by mass pop culture and a new breed of pop songsters singing
 
tunes on Irish themes.
 But traditional Irish music refused to
 
die,  and,  aided by a continuing migration from the old
 
country,  it experienced a reinvigoration that began in the
 
1970s and continues to this day.
 Central to this Irish music
 
renaissance is fiddler Elizabeth "Liz" Carroll.
 
Liz Carroll was born in Chicago in 1956 of Irish
 
immigrant parents from County Offaly and County Limerick.
 Her
 
father,  a button accordion player,  began teaching her Irish
 
traditional music when she was 5,  and Liz also had the
 
opportunity to hear her grandfather play during visits to
 
Ireland.
 Although she studied classical violin for a brief
 
period from a nun at her parochial school,  local concerts of
 
Irish music,  sessions (
informal Irish musical gatherings),  and
 
her family were her main sources of musical schooling.
 Liz
 
honed her skills through years of playing at meetings of  the
 
Irish Traditional Musicians Association,  and exposure to the
 
music of veteran Chicago Irish musicians Johnny McGreevy,  Joe
 
Shannon,  Seamus Cooley,  Jimmy and Elenor Neary,  and others,
 
who imbued her with a wealth of tunes,  techniques,  and stories
 
that gave her a breadth and depth of musical and cultural
 
knowledge possessed by few of her generation.
 In 1975,  after
 
a series of stunning victories in the junior division of the
 
All-Ireland Fiddle Championship,  Liz,  then 18 years of age,
 
astounded the Irish music world both in the U.S.  and in
 
Ireland by winning the senior division championship title.
 In
 
accomplishing this feat,  she was immediately recognized as one
 
of the most outstanding Irish fiddlers of all time.
 This is
 
still true today.
 Folklorist and concert producer Nick
 
Spitzer says of Liz:  "She is widely admired for her wide
 
-mo r e-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 4
 
repertoire of tunes  [
that includes many of her own
 
compositions]  and for her enthusiastic,  but carefully crafted
 
playing that mingles a variety of regional styles.!!
 
Liz Carroll's artistry flows from a deep sense of
 
connection and devotion to Irish music and culture.
 As she
 
has commented,  "It's just one of those ingrained things,  the
 
kind of thing you keep going back to."
 Liz has never worked
 
full-time as a musician,  preferring to stay close to home in
 
order to raise her children and to take part in the many
 
sessions that take place in homes and community gathering
 
places in and around the Cook County area  (once jokingly
 
referred to as  "County Cook,"  for its important international
 
place in Irish music).
 Occasional excursions from her Chicago
 
home have taken her to festivals and concerts,  including the
 
Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife,  the National Folk
 
Festival,  and the "Folk Masters" concert series at Wolf Trap,
 
among others.
 
CLARENCE FOUNTAIN AND THE BLIND BOYS
 
Since the 1960s,  commercial gospel music has most often
 
taken the form of soloists backed by large choirs.
 Its
 
predecessor,  though,  was a much smaller group of four or five
 
members singing one-on-a-part that stretches back to
 
19th-century minstrel and black college singing and the
 
jubilee quartets that were especially popular in the 1930s.
 
In the wake of the great migration of rural southern Blacks
 
northward in the early 20th century,  gospel pioneers like C.A.
 
Tindly of Philadelphia,  Thomas Dorsey of Chicago,  and W.
 
Brewster of Memphis wrote music that combined elements of
 
European choral singing and harmony with the more African
 
preferences for alternation between a lead singer and group
 
response,  vocal devices associated with early blues and jazz,
 
and a more syncopated rhythm.
 This new,  urban musical sound
 
left its mark on jubilee quartets that in the 1940s continued
 
to evolve into "gospel" quartets,  as they incorporated the
 
highly emotive character of the "sanctified" music of
 
Pentecostal and Holiness churches into the style of the lead
 
singer and a more driving rhythm.
 While in the commercial
 
realm of gospel,  the large choir style predominates,  quartet
 
music still commands a strong following among Black church
 
members in both the North and South.
 
Clarence Fountain and the Blind Boys were "discovered" by
 
theater-going audiences in 1987 when they appeared in the
 
Obie-winning musical  "Gospel at Colonus," an adaptation of  the
 
Greek tragedy "Oedipus at Colonus."
 But in reality,  this was
 
only the latest success in the history of  the group that
 
started in the early 1940s as schoolmates singing together at
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 5
 
Alabama's Talladega Institute for the Deaf and Blind.
 
Founding member Clarence Fountain remembers how after the
 
group scored its first hit record "I Can See Everybody's
 
Mother But Mine"  in 1949 and was signed by Specialty Records
 
in 1953,  there was great pressure to switch over to the rock
 
'n'  roll sound of pop music.
 But Fountain refused,  saying,
 
"Rock is alright for those who are into it,  but the Blind Boys
 
have devoted our lives to serving the Lord."
 
While the group has experienced changes in membership
 
over the years,  current members Clarence Fountain,  Jimmy
 
Carter,  George Scott,  and Johnny Fields are outstanding
 
veterans of quartet singing and have been with the group since
 
the 1940s. And as a group,  they have kept their integrity
 
intact,  upholding the nickname "house-wreckers," given to the
 
most exciting quartets in recognition of  their ability to
 
"shout"  the church by stirring their listeners into states of
 
spiritual ecstasy.
 "We never really had a chance to be on big
 
national TV shows or anything like that," Fountain once said,
 
"because I think we were a little too intense for that.
 So we
 
built our audience the really hard way:  night after night,
 
town after town,  from one side of the country to the other."
 
Today,  Clarence Fountain and the Blind Boys continue to
 
draw large audiences to theaters,  churches,  festivals,  and
 
nightclubs around the country,  as they have for over 50 years.
 
More and more,  they are reaching broad audiences outside of
 
the Black church network.
 Recent appearances include the
 
World Music Institute in New York City,  the New Orleans Jazz
 
and Heritage Festival,  the Monterey Bay Blues Festival,  the
 
San Francisco Symphony Summ er Pop Series,  and the Detroit
 
Festival for the Arts.
 
MARY MITCHELL GABRIEL
 
The centuries-old basketmaking traditions of Maine's
 
Indian tribal peoples are today at perhaps the most important
 
juncture of their history.
 While interest in basketmaking has
 
been on the wane among tribal youth,  a heightened concern for
 
the future of their culture and a deep love of their artistic
 
tradition has motivated a determined group of basketmakers and
 
cultural advocates to act.
 Unprecedented collaborations
 
between several tribes and state arts and natural resource
 
agencies have tackled problems of dwindling supplies of
 
basketmaking materials,  inadequate markets,  and disinterest in
 
learning traditional aesthetic principles and skills.
 Central
 
to these efforts among the Passamaquoddy people is one of  the
 
most accomplished and giving basketmakers of  the region-- Mary
 
Mitchell Gabriel.
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 6
 
Mary was born in the Passamaquoddy Indian Township of
 
Princeton,  Maine,  in 1908.
 Her mother and grandmother were
 
dedicated basketmakers and her father built birchbark canoes,
 
paddles,  and snowshoes.
 She began learning the skills of
 
making Passamaquoddy baskets out of sweetgrass and brown ash
 
splints from her grandmother.
 "I pestered her to teach me,"
 
she said.
 Under her grandmother's direction,  she made her
 
first basket when she was seven or eight years old.
 Mary's
 
daughter Sylvia,  also a basketmaker,  described the change in
 
traditional style that they both were a part of:  "In the
 
beginning,  Indian women made the baskets for their own use.
 
Later,  tourists arrived and wanted to buy them.
 As time went
 
on,  the baskets became more and more fancy.
 We all learned
 
from one another.
 They handed down the traditions."
 
Traditionally,  basketmakers would harvest sweetgrass from the
 
coastal salt marshes in July and allow them to dry for several
 
months before braiding them.
 Brown ash logs were pounded to
 
loosen each ring, which was then stripped to the desired
 
length and thickness.
 In her younger years,  Mary did all this
 
herself,  but now she purchases the sweetgrass and splints from
 
other tribal members.
 
Mary's baskets are both traditional and individualistic,
 
reflecting both a recognition of the need to produce
 
marketable baskets and a strong personal creative sense.
 
"[Some ideas just]  pop out of my head,"  she says.
 Her basket
 
types range from the popular striped bowl basket,  to the
 
striped "sea urchin"-  shaped bowl basket,  to her "baked bean
 
crock,"  to the larger sewing and flat baskets.
 Many of her
 
covered baskets display her "trademark" braided frog handle
 
that she created.
 One remarkable aspect of her baskets is  the
 
closeness of their weave,  which not only is beautiful,  but
 
ensures  that their beauty will last long into the future.
 "If
 
I am to be remembered for my baskets,  I want them to live
 
forever,"  she once said.
 Her sweetgrass braiding skills are
 
well honed,  and at one time she could weave nearly 100 yards
 
in a day.
 
Though Mary Gabriel has long been known among her people
 
as a fine basketmaker,  significant wider recognition has only
 
come in recent years through awards and exhibits featuring her
 
work.
 She has been a senior counselor to the burgeoning
 
basketry revival among Maine Natives,  and most importantly,
 
she continues to produce baskets of extraordinary beauty.
 As
 
she once said,  "I' ve asked the Lord to please let me keep
 
making my baskets and I guess He must agree!"

JOHNNY GIMBLE
 
In the words of Merle Haggard,  Johnny Gimble is  "the
 
greatest  [Texas]  swing fiddler alive today."
 Born in East
 
Texas in 1926,  and raised on a farm near Tyler,  Johnny Gimble
 
became heir to both the old and the new of the immensely
 
influential fiddle traditions of Texas.
 The Depression years
 
of the 1930s saw the old-time,  Southern-derived Anglo string
 
band tradition with its breakdowns,  schottisches,  waltzes,  and
 
reels blend with the big-band jazz and pop music of the day to
 
form a new sound known as  "Western swing."
 Epitomized and
 
promoted by renowned bandleader Bob Wills and his group,  The
 
Texas Playboys,  in the 1940s and later, Western swing rose to
 
prominence nationally as one of the most popular American
 
regional musics.
 In 1949,  Johnny Gimble and his fiddle became
 
part of  that band and continue to bring the Texas fiddle sound
 
into the lives of millions of Americans through recording and
 
live performance.
 
Johnny was playing mandolin and fiddle professionally
 
with his brothers by age 13.
 Following his graduation from
 
high schoOl,  he performed with the Shelton Brothers on KWKH
 
radio in Shreveport,  Louisiana,  and in the campaign band
 
during Jimmie Davis's  (
the singing governor of  "You Are My
 
Sunshine"  fame)  successful bid for that state's highest
 
office.
 He did a stint in the military during World War II,
 
and then continued to hone his skills playing with a number of
 
Texas radio and dance bands until he joined Bob Wills.
 
According to Jim Day,  President of the Texas Old Time Fiddlers
 
Association,  "During those years  [with the Playboys]  Johnny
 
was very likely the most talented and technically gifted
 
fiddler of all the fiddlers who played with Bob Wills band.
 
As Bob Wills is given credit for making Western Swing famous,
 
Johnny Gimble had much to do with the development of  the sound
 
and rhythm of Western Swing."
 He left Wills'  band to settle
 
down and raise his children in Waco,  where he had a television
 
show for three years,  cut hair at the Veterans Administration
 
hospital,  and played for dances on weekends.
 
Then,  in 1968,  he moved to Nashville with his wife
 
Barbara and his $5,000 life savings.
 He arrived in Nashville
 
at a time when interest in the fiddle was on the rise.
 He
 
recorded with Merle Haggard  (
"If we Make It Through
 
December"),  Conway Twitty  (
"You' ve Never Been This Far
 
Before"),  Connie Smith  (
"If It Ain't Love"),  and other popular
 
artists.
 In 1975,  he won the Country Music Association's
 
coveted "Instrumentalist of the Year ,
, award,  the first of the
 
five times he received it.
 He was proclaimed "Fiddler of the
 
Year ,
, eight times by the Academy of Country Music and received
 
a Grammy in 1994 for his arrangement of  "Red Wing" on the Bob
 
Wills  tribute album by the group Asleep at the Wheel.
 Several
 
of his compositions like "Slow 'N Easy Blues" and "Under the
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 8
 
'X'  in Texas," are widely performed and were re-recorded on
 
his 1977 album,  Johnny Gimble's Texas Dance Party.
 
Despite his commercial success,  Gimble remains close to
 
his roots,  volunteering as guest performer at educational and
 
charitable events.
 In recent years,  he has appeared at the
 
National Folk Festival,  Houston's  "Texas Country Roots"
 
concert organized by Texas Folklife Resources,  and the "Folk
 
Masters"  series at Wolf Trap.
 "Folk Masters" artistic
 
director Nick Spitzer summed up the opinions of many
 
traditional music connoisseurs about Gimble:  "He was always a
 
consummate musician,  an articulate commentator on the roots
 
and branches of Texas country fiddling,  and highly respected
 
for his abilities and generosity by fellow musicians."
 
FRANCES VAROS GRAVES
 
In the deeply-rooted Hispanic culture of northern New
 
Mexico and southern Colorado,  weaving and embroidery have long
 
been a major medium of artistry.
 Born of the necessity in
 
Spanish colonial times of providing warmth,  "coichas," or
 
blankets fully embroidered with a characteristic form of
 
stitch,  are in a sense the regional Hispanic equivalent of  the
 
quilt.
 In the early years of the 20th century,  as
 
mass-produced items began to displace the meticulously
 
hand-embroidered coichas,  Frances Varos Graves was largely
 
responsible for an important counter-current to this trend
 
that has kept coicha embroidery an art and emblem of her
 
regional Hispanic culture.
 
Born Frances Varos in Arroyo Seco,  New Mexico,  in 1910,
 
she moved to the northern New Mexican Mormon community of
 
Carson in 1929  to work mending and repairing blankets  (Rio
 
Grande and Navajo weavings)  for several blanket traders that
 
included Claude Graves, whom she married in 1931.
 Although
 
her maternal great grandfather had been a weaver and her
 
mother had passed on her knowledge of spinning and dying wool
 
and needlework,  Frances saw her first coicha in Carson.
 "We
 
bought an old coicha in Ojo Caliente.
 Part of it needed
 
mending so we tore it apart and copied the stitch.
 We kept on
 
practicing until we got it right. .  .  .Right after I got married
 
I started making coichas for my own use.
 I made my first one
 
on gunny sacks for the floor.
 Money was hard to get and we
 
were paying off our land.
 Claude was working for the State
 
Highway Department for $3.75 per day and I made coichas.
 A
 
store owner in Chamita wanted every coicha that I made.
 He.

colchas since then and have taught and exhibited my work."

As other women in the area followed her example and
 
started their own coicha cottage industries,  a "Carson coicha"
 
style emerged that incorporated new stitch patterns and new
 
motifs into the old form.
 As described in a Millicent Rogers
 
Museum exhibit,  "Carson colchas are relatively easy to
 
identify in that they reflect an Anglo sense of pictorial
 
composition and are relatively large in size when compared to
 
earlier ones.
 In addition,  the materials used in the making
 
of a Carson coicha are almost all recycled.  .
 .
 Another
 
identifying feature...
. is the vertical direction of the
 
stitches, whereas in the older coicha embroideries,  the
 
stitches follow the curves of the pattern".
 
Frances Varos Graves continues to produce her distinctive
 
colchas.
 Her work has been exhibited widely, appearing in
 
one-woman shows in Taos,  the One Space/Three Visions exhibit
 
at the Albuquerque Museum,  the widely-toured exhibit Spanish
  
Textile Tradition of New Mexico and Colorado at the Museum of
 
International Folk Art in Santa Fe, and the Coicha Embroidery
  
of Northern New Mexico exhibit at the Millicent Rogers Museum,
 
among others.
 Her niece and her grandson's wife produce and
 
sell colchas, and through her participation in the New Mexico
 
Arts Division's state apprenticeship program,  she continues to
 
pass on her "Carson colcha"  tradition to future generations.
 
VIOLET  (ta(f.ablu) HILBERT
 
Born in the Skagit Valley of Washington State in 1918,
 
Violet "vi" Hu bert was part of a generation that grew up
 
speaking the Lushootseed (Puget Sound Salish)  language,  shared
 
by several Native American tribes from the Puget Sound
 
eastward to the Cascade Mountains.
 As a child, she was
 
surrounded by accomplished traditional orators and
 
storytellers.
 Her father was a tribal historian and one of
 
the last speakers of the Skagit Coast Salish language.
 Her
 
mother Louisa Anderson was a skilled raconteur and an
 
ebullient public speaker,  and her father Charlie Anderson
 
possessed a rich store of traditional stories and song.
 As a
 
young girl,  she traveled with her parents picking berries
 
throughout the Northwest and attended 15 schools before
 
receiving her high school diploma.
 Though she was forbidden
 
to speak her Native tongue at Indian boarding schools, outside
 
of school she was raised according to the old values by her
 
mother and father, who valued their family history and who
 
were proud of the rich store of ancestral names and stories
 
that, according to tribal tradition,  they owned and she would
 
inherit.
 She attended important tribal ceremonial events such
 
as funerals and naming ceremonies and was taught the strictest
 
standards of propriety that require generosity, discretion,
 
and forebearance.  An immense repertoire of traditional tales,
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows, page 10
 
artfulness of rhetorical style,  and the function of stories :n
 
maintaining tribal history were key to her traditional
 
upbringing.
 
In the 1960s, years after the deaths of her parents, her
 
concern for the rapidly diminishing number of Lushootseed
 
speakers and the infrequency of ceremonial settings for
 
oratory took her on a one-woman mission of cultural
 
preservation that continues to the present.
 "There are very
 
few places where the stories are still being told, and the
 
people who know them are dying.. .  .That's why I feel such a
 
sense of urgency to collect and write the remnants i know."
 
As a cultural conservator,  she is eager to remind tribal young
 
people of the aesthetic depth of storytelling and its
 
centrality to Native culture.
 "[The]  best storytellers could
 
become the characters in their stories," animating rocks,
 
trees,  and animals with subtle changes of voice and gesture.
 
At many social occasions for storytelling,  "there was duck
 
soup and bread and coffee.
 People who were hosting.. .would
 
invite their friends and relatives to join them.
 My parents
 
would bring cattail mats for us to sleep on because the party
 
went all night."
 In keeping with her concern for making the
 
stories a part of her people's future,  she studied linguistics
 
and labored hard to translate the often subtle meanings into
 
English so that those who did not learn the language may
 
understand.
 
Vi Hu bert has taken Lushootseed stories to wide
 
audiences- -non-Native and Native American- - throughout North
 
America.
 She has lectured and taught at universities and on
 
her own Upper Skagit reservation, has continued to speak at
 
tribal ceremonial events, has transcribed,  translated,  and
 
published her stories,  and has appeared in many public events,
 
such as the National Association for the Perpetuation and
 
Preservation of Storytelling in Tennessee.
 In 1989,  she
 
received the Washington Centennial Commission' s  Ethnic
 
Heritage Award.
 Her people say she often reminds them of the
 
story of the race between the Bear and the Ant to dig a hole.
 
While Bear took frequent rests, Ant never stopped to rest.
 He
 
worked so hard that he stretched himself thin,  almost to the
 
point of breaking in the middle.
 Ant won the race, and
 
aq
ablu's unflagging energy and dedication won her the
 
affectionate title "Ant."
 
SOSEI SHIZUYE MATSUNOTO
 
In East Asian cultures, many artistic traditions are
 
considered to be ways of achieving self-discipline as well as
 
a means of producing aesthetically engaging expressions of
 
creativity.
 There are numerous venerable examples of these
 
-
more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 11
 
"meditative arts," but in Japan none is more highly esteemed
 
or inclusive of different artistic media than chado, or "way
 
of the tea."
 In the words of Gerald Yoshitomi,  "The art of
 
Tea has been characterized as the very essence of Japanese
 
culture,  embodying as it does the various artistic disciplines
 
of ceramics,  architecture,  horticulture,  landscape
 
architecture,  visual art,  literature,  and calligraphy,  not to
 
mention the mental discipline which goes into the formation of
 
one's character."
 
Chado is a complex series of hundreds of steps designed
 
around the act of serving tea and requires a connoisseurship
 
of all the necessary physical accoutrements as well as acute
 
sensitivity in the disciplined interaction between its
 
participants.
 When properly practiced,  the natural setting,
 
the delicately wrought tea utensils,  the simple elegance of
 
the decorations,  and the smooth,  regulated movements of the
 
participants combine to remove the host and guests from the
 
pressures of the outside world and place them in an atmosphere
 
where each finds inner peace and tranquility.
 Historically,
 
chado has left its mark on many other art forms.  In the 16th
 
and 17th centuries,  for example,  tea masters influenced
 
theshaping of some of the most beautiful of ceramic tea ware,
 
always preferring the simple,  rustic,  and spare over the
 
highly finished and refined.
 
In the United States,  the most influential  teacher and
 
accomplished master of chado is Sosei Shizuye Matsumoto.
 M
ine.
 
Matsumoto was born in Honolulu,  Hawaii,  in 1920.
 Her interest
 
in cha-no-yu  (or chado)  as a young woman took her to Kyoto,
 
Japan,  where she studied for seven years to master the essence
 
of the tea ceremony,  and she received a teaching credential
 
from Tantansai,  the 14th generation Grandmaster of the
 
Urasenke School of Chado.
 After World War II,  she saw that
 
there were few practitioners of the tea ceremony among
 
Japanese-Americans in her new home of Los Angeles,  but her
 
desire to start a school was thwarted by the unsettled times,
 
with her people returning from the wartime internment camps.
 
In 1951,  she was invited to the signing of  the U.S.-Japan
 
peace treaty in San Francisco,  where over a four-day period
 
she and the Urasenke Grandmaster served tea to more than 3,000
 
American and Japanese officials,  including President Truman
 
and Prime Minister Yoshida.
 That same year she opened the
 
first tea ceremony classes in the United States,  and presented
 
the tea ceremony in the Twentieth Century Fox film "East is
 
East."
 In the 1950s,  Mi
ne. Matsumoto introduced millions of
 
Americans  to chado through appearances on CBS and NBC.
 In.
 
1968,  she was invited to present at the Olympic Arts Festival
 
in Mexico City.
 Her more than 40 years of teaching and
 
lecturing throughout the country has resulted in over 120
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 12
 
credentialed chado teachers and thousands more tea ceremony
 
devotees.
 
Sosei Shizuye Matsumoto has received numerous awards:  a
 
special commendation from the Minister of the Department of
 
Foreign Affairs of Japan  (
1960);  a Special Recognition Award
 
from the Urasenke School in Kyoto  (
1960);  the honorable master
 
of  tea ceremony,  "Meiyo Shihan"  (highest teaching certificate)
 
from the Urasenke School  (
1989);  the Japanese American
 
Cultural and Community Center's President's Award  (
1989);  and
 
The Order of the Sacred Treasure,  Gold and Silver Rays from
 
the Emperor of Japan in 1990,  the highest form of such
 
recognition.
 She has long been the major American proponent
 
of  the art of chado and its message of  "peace from a bowl of
 
tea."
 In the words of Chado Urasenke Los Angeles Chapter head
 
Glenn Webb,  "Mme. Matsumoto is the very e
m bodiment of a 'tea
 
person,'  or chajin. 
She not only knows  (and can teach)  all
 
the procedures for Chado;  she also manifests the true spirit
 
of self discipline and compassion for others,  which only a few
 
students of  tea attain.
 To the extent that she embodies the
 
ideal human being as defined in traditional Japanese society,
 
she is  the perfect role model."
 
D.L. MENARD
 
D.L. Menard is a singer,  a guitarist,  a writer of songs
 
that speak to the deepest sensibilities of Cajun people,  and
 
much more.
 In the minds of many,  it is especially fortunate
 
that he came along at perhaps the most critical time in Cajun
 
history since the French-speaking Acadians first migrated to
 
Louisiana from what is now Canada to escape religious and
 
cultural persecution in the late 1700s.
 Born in 1932,  he was
 
raised in the heart of Cajun country near the town of Erath,
 
when Cajun French was forbidden in schools and Cajun music was
 
said to be crude,  and when the ever-more intrusive pop culture
 
vied for the values and minds of Cajun young people.
 But D.L.
 
never consciously tried to preserve a lifestyle or to be a
 
spokesman for his people.
 His wit,  unfailing good humor,
 
generosity,  and overall make-up embodied a self-confident,
 
quintessential Cajun character that,  combined with his intense
 
musicality,  projected liveliness,  strength,  and creativity
 
into Cajun life.
 
Growing up,  D.L.  was a fan of Hank Williams and early
 
country music.
 "I first learned to sing by listening to an
 
old battery-powered wooden radio that we had.
 Every night,  I
 
turned it on to listen to Del Rio,  Texas,  and I learned those
 
songs that I heard on the radio.
 The battery would die every
 
year about a month or two before we sold the cotton.
 That was
 
the hardest time,  without the radio.
 I didn't play the guitar
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 13
 
yet,  but that's where I learned all my first songs.
 And all
 
those songs were in English.
 I couldn't hear any French songs
 
on the radio"  (
from The Makers of Cajun Music by Barry Jean
 
Ancelet).
 When D.L. was 16 years old,  his parents quit
 
farming and moved into town.
 There he heard his first live
 
Cajun music and immediately fell in love with the guitar.
 He
 
ordered one from a catalog for $11.00 and learned to play.
 
His first dance job was in Abbeville with Elias Badeaux and
 
the Louisiana Aces,  embarking on a musical path that would
 
place him firmly in the era of Cajun music marked by post
 
World War II road houses,  honky-tonks,  and family dance halls.
 
At first,  D.L.  specialized in singing English language
 
songs and left the Cajun ones to the more experienced singers.
 
Soon,  he was not only applying his heartfelt voice to songs in
 
French,  but began composing new songs,  and adding French words
 
to instrumentals.
 The local popularity of one of his first
 
songs surprised everyone,  including himself.
 "In those days,
 
a [recording]  session cost $175,  which included 300 records,
 
you understand,  and you could sell them.
 "La Porte d'en
 
Arriere"  (The Back Door)  came out on a Wednesday and by
 
Saturday I had my $175 back already and some extra money to
 
split among the guys in the band. .  .  .That night,  we had to play
 
it seven times on the bandstand."
 "La Porte d'en Arriere"  and
 
many of his other songs like "Un Homme Marie" and "La Vie d'un
 
Vieux Garcon," have become part of the standard traditional
 
repertoire.
 To pursue his musical interests,  D.L.  quit his
 
service station job to find another,  more flexible job.
 He
 
learned how to make chairs,  and opened a shop next to his
 
house.
 His comfortable rockers are found in homes throughout
 
the area,  and when he appears at folk festivals,  he often
 
demonstrates chairmaking when he's not playing music.
 
Since 1973,  D.L.  has been taking Cajun bands to
 
festivals,  including the National Folk Festival and the
 
Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife.
 He has represented
 
the U.S.  abroad,  touring for the State Department to South and
 
Central America,  Asia,  the Near East,  and Europe,  and has come
 
to be one of the most well-known representatives of Cajun
 
culture.
 In his words,  "It made us feel so proud of our
 
culture to see people from all over applauding the music we
 
brought them from south Louisiana."
 
SIMON SHAHEEN
 
The oud  (also,  ud),  a pear-shaped lute,  has been in
 
Arabic musical tradition since at least the 7th century,
 
having been borrowed from their Persian neighbors.
 The
 
long-time favor it has commanded among musicians from many
 
musical traditions,  both rural and urban,  throughout the
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 14
 
culturally diverse Arab world has given the oud great stature
 
as a vehicle for highly-developed artistry and an important
 
source of identity and common ground among Arabs and Middle
 
Easterners.
 In Arabic cultures, most masterful musicians do
 
not feel impeded by the boundaries of categories like "folk,"
 
"classical," and "popular" as they move freely between
 
repertoires and styles intended for different occasions,  and
 
this is particularly the case with the highly adaptable oud.
 
Since his immigration to the United States in 1980,  Simon
 
Shaheen has been recognized as the premier Arabic oud virtuoso
 
in this country,  and in the words of Arabic ethnomusicologist
 
and musician Jihad Racy,  "[Shaheen]  is one of the top few
 
musicians in the entire Arab world."
 
Simon Shaheen was born in 1955 in the Arab Christian
 
village of Tarshiha in the Gau l region of Israel.
 He first
 
took up the oud at age four,  and under the tutelage of his
 
father,  Hikmet Shaheen,  a renowned teacher and composer of
 
Arabic music,  performed his first public improvisation at age
 
six.
 Simon fondly recalls studying with his father:  "It
 
wasn't like music lessons.
 My father played,  and I played,
 
too."
 After moving to Haifa,  he studied western classical
 
violin at the  Rubin Conservatory and went on to Tel Aviv,
 
where he earned a E.A.  in music and Arabic literature.
 In
 
Israel,  he took part in an extended performance series of
 
Arabic Music for National Israeli Television and Radio between
 
1973 and 1978.
 When he came to the United States,  he earned
 
an M.A.  in Music Education from Columbia University and an
 
M.A.  in Music Performance from the Manhattan School of music.
 
In the U.S.,  Simon has proven himself a highly versatile,
 
virtuosic,  and creative musician who knows few boundaries,
 
social or musical.
 Upon his arrival,  he mainly made his
 
living playing a wide range of social occasions for Middle
 
Easterners of many backgrounds.
 Increasingly,  his exquisite
 
talents have been recognized by critics and presenters,
 
bringing him greater opportunity to display his
 
concert-oriented,  creative side.
 New York Times critic Tim
 
Page has likened him to the Spanish guitarist Segovia,  and
 
Edward Rothstein has written of his  "virtuosic
 
sophistication."
 Shaheen has composed many new works in an
 
"art music"  style,  incorporating a "subtle combination of
 
traditional Near Eastern techniques with contemporary
 
[Western]  ideas of form," according to scholar Philip
 
Schuyler.
 
While he now devotes great effort to his personal musical
 
career,  his compositions,  and his Near Eastern Music Ensemble,
 
he has not let this narrow the range of his musical interests
 
nor limit his concern for his fellow Arabs in the United
 
States.
 He travels widely to perform at important Arab
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 15
 
events,  and to share his skill with developing Arab musicians.
 
He has been a vital force in keeping these traditions alive.
 
In the words of his nominator Margaret Wolfson,  Mr.  Shaheen's
 
authentic cultural and musical roots,  his extraordinary skill
 
and experience as performer and teacher,  his fluency-
-
 
derived
 
from natural ability and serious study-
- in both Near Eastern
 
and western musical styles,  his vibrancy as a person and
 
dedication to his musical heritage,  combine to make him an
 
ideal instrument to transmit and preserve near Eastern folk
 
music in this country."
 
LILY VORPERIAN
 
It often seems that the incomprehensible social upheaval
 
experienced by Armenian people who fled the massacres of 1910
 
in their homeland only strengthened their resolve to maintain
 
their unique cultural identity.
 In Southern California,  the
 
"Capital of the Diaspora" where over 300,000 Armenians live,
 
many of their most venerable traditions are alive and in some
 
ways flourishing.
 In 1989,  Armenian oudist Richard Hagopian
 
of Fresno was recognized through a National Heritage
 
Fellowship for his tasteful musicianship and for his efforts
 
to keep traditional music a part of Armenian social life.
 In
 
Armenian crafts,  no artist commands greater respect than Lily
 
Vorperian:  inheritor,  practitioner,  and creator of
 
Marash-style embroidery.
 
Lily Kambourian was born a refugee,  in Aleppo,  Syria,  in
 
1919,  three years after her parents had fled the Armenian City
 
of Marash.
 Raised in the Armenian colony in Aleppo,  she
 
married Haroutioun Vorperian in 1937,  had four children,  and
 
was widowed in 1953.
 She moved to Beirut in 1964 and came to
 
the U.S.  in 1978,  once again escaping the disasters of war.
 
At age 12,  she began embroidering,  learning from the elderly
 
women who came to her house daily because it was a center for
 
refugee aid distribution.
 With the exception of her high
 
school years and while she was raising young children alone,
 
she has dedicated herself to her embroidery.
 Though she is
 
familiar with 18 other regional Armenian embroidery styles,
 
she always preferred that of her parents'  home town of Marash,
 
known for its tasteful color combinations,  intricate designs,
 
and complex,  demanding stitchery.
 When asked why she favored
 
the Marash style,  she answered "Because it is the hardest.
 
It's the same with cooking.
 I always want to prepare the
 
hardest things."
 
Ms.  Vorperian is a master of her craft,  an artist of
 
national and even international stature.
 In the words of
 
folklorist Susan Auerbach,  "Not only is her workmanship in a
 
complex technique superb,  but her intricate designs bring
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 16
 
Marash work to a new aesthetic level,  while still keeping to
 
traditional forms.
 Marash embroidery is the vehicle through
 
which she expresses her creative energy and vision,  as well as
 
her passionate cultural pride.
 While most women who still do
 
Marash work rely on ready-made patterns or repeat a few simple
 
designs,  Lily creates her own work from start to finish and
 
takes pride in devising so many variations on Marash-style
 
design."
 Lily often boasts of the neatness of her work:  "Look
 
how clean it is on the back."
 Her Marash technique barely
 
pricks the surface of the reverse side,  even though the basis
 
of each design is interconnected herringbone stitches,  over
 
and under which the thread may be woven four or even eight
 
times.
 Clusters of squares or crosses then become the
 
building blocks for bold patterns.
 The effect is slightly
 
raised and intricate,  reminiscent of traditional Armenian
 
wood-carving,  stonework,  or jewelry engraving.
 In recent
 
years,  she has been known for her embroidery of slogans and
 
names in the Armenian alphabet that speak her sentiment
 
concerning the tragedy of her people,  such as  "Oh,  Armenian
 
people,  your only salvation is in your collective strength."
 
Today,  her work motivates her more than ever.
 "I feel a
 
lot younger.
 I want to show that I can do 10 times this
 
amount if I live."
 Admiring cultural compatriots and
 
non-Armenians alike share her desire,  inviting her to exhibit
 
and demonstrate her work in festivals and exhibit sites in
 
California,  such as the Los Angeles  "City Roots Festival" and
 
the Armenian Cultural Festival sponsored by the City of Los
 
Angeles.
 The Armenian Relief Society proudly displays its
 
logo,  a large Marash embroidery by Lily Vorperian.
 
ELDER ROMA WILSON
 
As is often the case with music passed on through aural
 
tradition,  an artist's creations may become more famous than
 
the artist himself.
 This is certainly the case with harmonica
 
player,  singer,  and composer Elder Roma Wilson,  whose music is
 
known to millions of Americans,  while he remained in obscurity
 
until being "rediscovered"  in the 1980s by his former partner
 
in song,  Reverend Leon Pinson.
 
Roma Wilson was born in 1910 and hails originally from
 
Tupelo,  Mississippi.
 Folklorist Worth Long recounts Wilson's
 
early musical life:  "Elder Roma Wilson learned to play the
 
harmonica as a boy with old,  worn-out harps discarded by his
 
older brothers.
 He learned to  'choke'  these harps in order to
 
get traditional sounds out of them.
 He was taught by both
 
traditional secular and sacred harp masters and became known
 
throughout the state for his version of  the song  'This
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 17
 
Train.'" A young minister as well as accomplished harpist,
 
Wilson subsequently teamed up with the young,  blind,
 
guitar-playing Reverend Pinson to travel around Mississippi
 
and Arkansas,  preaching the gospel on the "brush arbor"
 
circuit and playing the religion-inspired music for which they
 
both became known as masters.
 
In the 1940s,  he parted ways with Pinson and moved to
 
Detroit to raise his family,  making his living as a street
 
musician on Hastings Street.
 It was here that Joe Von Battle,
 
owner of Joe's Record Shop covertly recorded Wilson's
 
astonishing harp-blowing and subsequently released a 78 rpm
 
recording of  "Lily of the Valley" and "Better Get Ready," on
 
the Gotham label.
 These recordings became legendary,  and when
 
they were re-released in 1983 by St.  George Records,  the liner
 
notes stated:  "Concerning Elder R. Wilson,  nothing of a
 
background nature is available for study.
 Robert  [Richard]
 
remembered recording with a preacher,  but sadly nothing
 
else. .
.  .Hopefully more information will surface on this
 
charismatic preacher who blew harp and quite possibly had the
 
help of ascending masters,  as blues legends claim that one
 
sold one's soul to the devil to play that well."
 Elder Wilson
 
replies:  "That ain't true.
 I
' m alive and well in Mississippi
 
and still don't play no blues."
 Elder Wilson also taught his
 
sons to play the harp,  and in another 1940s recording at Joe's
 
Record Shop,  he and his three sons made what is now considered
 
to be an important historic 78 rpm release of what Mike Seeger
 
has called "the single most important selection by multi-harp
 
players in existence."
 
Elder Wilson and Reverend Pinson were reunited when
 
Wilson returned to Red Hill, Mississippi,  in the 1980s.
 They
 
have since performed at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage
 
Festival,  the Chicago Blues Festival,  the Smithsonian Festival
 
of American Folklife,  the National Black Arts Festival,  and
 
other major events.
 In 1991,  the Southern Arts Federation
 
took them to venues throughout the South as part of the "Deep
 
South Musical Roots"  tour.
 Elder Wilson's performances today,
 
usually coupled with his long-time partner Pinson,  move
 
audiences as much as they ever did,  as described by David
 
Whiteis of  the Chicaqo Sun-Times: "Wilson,  who alternates his
 
harp blowing with 'brush arbor'  preaching in the traditional
 
southern rural style,  provides eloquent accompaniment and a
 
gentle impetus for Pinson's fretwork.
 Together they provide a
 
rare testimony to the power of music as a vehicle of faith."

LIZ CARROLL
 
Irish traditional music has been an important thread in
 
America's artistic fabric since the immigration of an
 
estimated seven million Irish fleeing famine,  poverty,  and
 
oppression in the mid and late 19th century.
 Irish musicians
 
from remote villages in the old country met and exchanged
 
ideas and regional repertoires and styles.
 New,  urban,  Irish
 
"villages" took shape in places like Chicago and the Bronx in
 
which Irish fiddlers,  pipers,  flutists,  harpists,  and the
 
like,  enjoyed a lively,  creative musical ambience.
 While the
 
first Irish recordings were made in New York,  the "bible" of
 
Irish tunes appeared in Chicago in 1903,  an enormous  (still
 
the largest anywhere)  compilation by Chicago's Chief
 
Superintendent of Police,  Francis O'Neill.
 It was said that
 
O'Neill had an open job offer on the police force for any good
 
fiddler or piper.
 In the mid-1900s,  this older-style Irish
 
music with its ancient Gaelic ballads and vast instrumental
 
repertoire was falling increasingly into disfavor,  edged out
 
by mass pop culture and a new breed of pop songsters singing
 
tunes on Irish themes.
 But traditional Irish music refused to
 
die,  and,  aided by a continuing migration from the old
 
country,  it experienced a reinvigoration that began in the
 
1970s and continues to this day.
 Central to this Irish music
 
renaissance is fiddler Elizabeth "Liz" Carroll.
 
Liz Carroll was born in Chicago in 1956 of Irish
 
immigrant parents from County Offaly and County Limerick.
 Her
 
father,  a button accordion player,  began teaching her Irish
 
traditional music when she was 5,  and Liz also had the
 
opportunity to hear her grandfather play during visits to
 
Ireland.
 Although she studied classical violin for a brief
 
period from a nun at her parochial school,  local concerts of
 
Irish music,  sessions (informal Irish musical gatherings),  and
 
her family were her main sources of musical schooling.
 Liz
 
honed her skills through years of playing at meetings of the
 
Irish Traditional Musicians Association,  and exposure to the
 
music of veteran Chicago Irish musicians Johnny McGreevy,  Joe
 
Shannon,  Seamus Cooley,  Jimmy and Elenor Neary,  and others,
 
who imbued her with a wealth of tunes,  techniques,  and stories
 
that gave her a breadth and depth of musical and cultural
 
knowledge possessed by few of her generation.
 In 1975,  after
 
a series of stunning victories in the junior division of the
 
All-Ireland Fiddle Championship,  Liz,  then 18 years of age,
 
astounded the Irish music world both in the U.S.  and in
 
Ireland by winning the senior division championship title.
 In
 
accomplishing this feat,  she was immediately recognized as one
 
of the most outstanding Irish fiddlers of all time.
 This is
 
still true today.
 Folklorist and concert producer Nick
 
Spitzer says of Liz:  "She is widely admired for her wide
 
-more-
I
  
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 4
 
repertoire of tunes  [that includes many of her own
 
compositions]  and for her enthusiastic,  but carefully crafted
 
playing that mingles a variety of regional styles."
 
Liz Carroll's artistry flows from a deep sense of
 
connection and devotion to Irish music and culture.
 As she
 
has commented,  "It's just one of those ingrained things,  the
 
kind of thing you keep going back to."
 Liz has never worked
 
full-time as a musician,  preferring to stay close to home in
 
order to raise her children and to take part in the many
 
sessions that take place in homes and community gathering
 
places in and around the Cook County area  (once jokingly
 
referred to as "County Cook," for its important international
 
place in Irish music) .
 Occasional excursions from her Chicago
 
home have taken her to festivals and concerts,  including the
 
Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife,  the National Folk
 
Festival,  and the "Folk Masters" concert series at Wolf Trap,
 
among others.
 
CLARENCE FOUNTAIN AND THE BLIND BOYS
 
Since the 1960s,  commercial gospel music has most often
 
taken the form of soloists backed by large choirs.
 Its
 
predecessor,  though,  was a much smaller group of four or five
 
members singing one-on-a-part that stretches back to
 
19th-century minstrel and black college singing and the
 
jubilee quartets that were especially popular in the 1930s.
 
In the wake of the great migration of rural southern Blacks
 
northward in the early 20th century,  gospel pioneers like C.A.
 
Tindly of Philadelphia,  Thomas Dorsey of Chicago,  and W.
 
Brewster of Memphis wrote music that combined elements of
 
European choral singing and harmony with the more African
 
preferences for alternation between a lead singer and group
 
response,  vocal devices associated with early blues and jazz,
 
and a more syncopated rhythm.
 This new,  urban musical sound
 
left its mark on jubilee quartets that in the 1940s continued
 
to evolve into "gospel" quartets,  as they incorporated the
 
highly emotive character of the "sanctified" music of
 
Pentecostal and Holiness churches into the style of the lead
 
singer and a more driving rhythm.
 While in the commercial
 
realm of gospel,  the large choir style predominates,  quartet
 
music still commands a strong following among Black church
 
members in both the North and South.
 
Clarence Fountain and the Blind Boys were "discovered" by
 
theater-going audiences in 1987 when they appeared in the
 
Obie-winning musical "Gospel at Colonus," an adaptation of the
 
Greek tragedy "Oedipus at Colonus."
 But in reality,  this was
 
only the latest success in the history of the group that
 
started in the early 1940s as schoolmates singing together at
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows, page 5
 
Alabama's Talladega Institute for the Deaf and Blind.
 
Founding member Clarence Fountain remembers how after the
 
group scored its first hit record "I Can See Everybody's
 
Mother But Mine"  in 1949 and was signed by Specialty Records
 
in 1953,  there was great pressure to switch over to the rock
 
'n'  roll sound of pop music.
 But Fountain refused,  saying,
 
"Rock is alright for those who are into it,  but the Blind Boys
 
have devoted our lives to serving the Lord."
 
While the group has experienced changes in membership
 
over the years,  current members Clarence Fountain,  Jimmy
 
Carter,  George Scott,  and Johnny Fields are outstanding
 
veterans of quartet singing and have been with the group since
 
the 1940s.  And as a group,  they have kept their integrity
 
intact,  upholding the nickname "house-wreckers," given to the
 
most exciting quartets in recognition of their ability to
 
"shout" the church by stirring their listeners into states of
 
spiritual ecstasy.
 "We never really had a chance to be on big
 
national TV shows or anything like that," Fountain once said,
 
"because I think we were a little too intense for that.
 So we
 
built our audience the really hard way:  night after night,
 
town after town,  from one side of the country to the other."
 
Today,  Clarence Fountain and the Blind Boys continue to
 
draw large audiences to theaters,  churches,  festivals,  and
 
nightclubs around the country,  as they have for over 50 years.
 
More and more,  they are reaching broad audiences outside of
 
the Black church network.
 Recent appearances include the
 
World Music Institute in New York City,  the New Orleans Jazz
 
and Heritage Festival,  the Monterey Bay Blues Festival,  the
 
San Francisco Symphony Summer Pop Series,  and the Detroit
 
Festival for the Arts.
 
MARY MITCHELL GABRIEL
 
The centuries-old basketmaking traditions of Maine's
 
Indian tribal peoples are today at perhaps the most important
 
juncture of their history.
 While interest in basketmaking has
 
been on the wane among tribal youth,  a heightened concern for
 
the future of their culture and a deep love of their artistic
 
tradition has motivated a determined group of basketmakers and
 
cultural advocates to act.
 Unprecedented collaborations
 
between several tribes and state arts and natural resource
 
agencies have tackled problems of dwindling supplies of
 
basketmaking materials,  inadequate markets,  and disinterest in
 
learning traditional aesthetic principles and skills.
 Central
 
to these efforts among the Passamaquoddy people is one of the
 
most accomplished and giving basketmakers of the region--Mary
 
Mitchell Gabriel.
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows, page 6
 
Mary was born in the Passamaquoddy Indian Township of
 
Princeton,  Maine,  in 1908.
 Her mother and grandmother were
 
dedicated basketmakers and her grandfather built birchbark
 
canoes,
 
paddles,  and snowshoes.
 She began learning the skills of
 
making Passamaquoddy baskets out of sweetgrass and brown ash
 
splints from her grandmother.
 "I pestered her to teach me,"
 
she said.
 Under her grandmother's direction,  she made her
 
first basket when she was seven or eight years old.
 Mary's
 
daughter Sylvia,  also a basketmaker,  described the change in
 
traditional style that they both were a part of:  "In the
 
beginning,  Indian women made the baskets for their own use.
 
Later,  tourists arrived and wanted to buy them.
 As time went
 
on,  the baskets became more and more fancy.
 We all learned
 
from one another.
 They handed down the traditions."
 
Traditionally,  basketmakers would harvest sweetgrass from the
 
coastal salt marshes in July and allow them to dry for several
 
months before braiding them.
 Brown ash logs were pounded to
 
loosen each ring,  which was then stripped to the desired
 
length and thickness.
 In her younger years,  Mary did all this
 
herself,  but now she purchases the sweetgrass and splints from
 
other tribal members.
 
Mary's baskets are both traditional and individualistic,
 
reflecting both a recognition of the need to produce
 
marketable baskets and a strong personal creative sense.
 
"[Some ideas just]  pop out of my head," she says.
 Her basket
 
types range from the popular striped bowl basket,  to the
 
striped "sea urchin"- shaped bowl basket,  to her "baked bean
 
crock," to the larger sewing and flat baskets.
 Many of her
 
covered baskets display her "trademark" braided frog handle
 
that she created.
 One remarkable aspect of her baskets is the
 
closeness of their weave,  which not only is beautiful,  but
 
ensures that their beauty will last long into the future.
 "If
 
I am to be remembered for my baskets,  I want them to live
 
forever," she once said.
 Her sweetgrass braiding skills are
 
well honed,  and at one time she could weave nearly 100 yards
 
in a day.
 
Though Mary Gabriel has long been known among her people
 
as a fine basketmaker,  significant wider recognition has only
 
come in recent years through awards and exhibits featuring her
 
work.
 She has been a senior counselor to the burgeoning
 
basketry revival among Maine Natives,  and most importantly,
 
she continues to produce baskets of extraordinary beauty.
 As
 
she once said,  "I've asked the Lord to please let me keep
 
making my baskets and I guess He must agree!"

JOHNNY GIMBLE
 
In the words of Merle Haggard,  Johnny Gimble is "the
 
greatest  [Texas]  swing fiddler alive today."
 Born in East
 
Texas in 1926,  and raised on a farm near Tyler,  Johnny Gimble
 
became heir to both the old and the new of the immensely
 
influential fiddle traditions of Texas.
 The Depression years
 
of the 1930s saw the old-time,  Southern-derived Anglo string
 
band tradition with its breakdowns,  schottisches,  waltzes,  and
 
reels blend with the big-band jazz and pop music of the day to
 
form a new sound known as "Western swing."
 Epitomized and
 
promoted by renowned bandleader Bob Wills and his group,  The
 
Texas Playboys,  in the 1940s and later,  Western swing rose to
 
prominence nationally as one of the most popular American
 
regional musics.
 In 1949,  Johnny Gimble and his fiddle became
 
part of that band and continue to bring the Texas fiddle sound
 
into the lives of millions of Americans through recording and
 
live performance.
 
Johnny was playing mandolin and fiddle professionally
 
with his brothers by age 13.
 Following his graduation from
 
high school,  he performed with the Shelton Brothers on KWKH
 
radio in Shreveport,  Louisiana,  and in the campaign band
 
during Jimmie Davis's  (the singing governor of "You Are My
 
Sunshine" fame)  successful bid for that state's highest
 
office.
 He did a stint in the military during World War II,
 
and then continued to hone his skills playing with a number of
 
Texas radio and dance bands until he joined Bob Wills.
 
According to Jim Day,  President of the Texas Old Time Fiddlers
 
Association,  "During those years  [with the Playboys]  Johnny
 
was very likely the most talented and technically gifted
 
fiddler of all the fiddlers who played with Bob Wills band.
 
As Bob Wills is given credit for making Western Swing famous,
 
Johnny Gimble had much to do with the development of the sound
 
and rhythm of Western Swing."
 He left Wills'  band to settle
 
down and raise his children in Waco,  where he had a television
 
show for three years,  cut hair at the Veterans Administration
 
hospital,  and played for dances on weekends.
 
Then,  in 1968,  he moved to Nashville with his wife
 
Barbara and his $5,000 life savings.
 He arrived in Nashville
 
at a time when interest in the fiddle was on the rise.
 He
 
recorded with Merle Haggard  (
"If we Make It Through
 
December"),  Conway Twitty  (
"You've Never Been This Far
 
Before"),  Connie Smith  (
"If It Ain't Love"),  and other popular
 
artists.
 In 1975,  he won the Country Music Association's
 
coveted "Instrumentalist of the Year" award,  the first of the
 
five times he received it.
 He was proclaimed "Fiddler of the
 
Year" eight times by the Academy of Country Music and received
 
a Grammy in 1994 for his arrangement of "Red Wing" on the Bob
 
Wills tribute album by the group Asleep at the Wheel.
 Several
 
of his compositions like "Slow IN Easy Blues" and "Under the
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows, page 8
 
'X'  in Texas," are widely performed and were re-recorded on
 
his 1977 album,  Johnny Giinble's Texas Dance Party.
 
Despite his commercial success,  Gimble remains close to
 
his roots,  volunteering as guest performer at educational and
 
charitable events.
 In recent years,  he has appeared at the
 
National Folk Festival,  Houston's "Texas Country Roots"
 
concert organized by Texas Folklife Resources,  and the "Folk
 
Masters" series at Wolf Trap.
 "Folk Masters" artistic
 
director Nick Spitzer summed up the opinions of many
 
traditional music connoisseurs about Giinble:  "He was always a
 
consummate musician,  an articulate commentator on the roots
 
and branches of Texas country fiddling,  and highly respected
 
for his abilities and generosity by fellow musicians."
 
FRANCES VAROS GRAVES
 
In the deeply-rooted Hispanic culture of northern New
 
Mexico and southern Colorado,  weaving and embroidery have long
 
been a major medium of artistry.
 Born of the necessity in
 
Spanish colonial times of providing warmth,  "colchas," or
 
blankets fully embroidered with a characteristic form of
 
stitch,  are in a sense the regional Hispanic equivalent of the
 
quilt.
 In the early years of the 20th century,  as
 
mass-produced items began to displace the meticulously
 
hand-embroidered colchas,  Frances Varos Graves was largely
 
responsible for an important counter-current to this trend
 
that has kept colcha embroidery an art and emblem of her
 
regional Hispanic culture.
 
Born Frances Varos in Arroyo Seco,  New Mexico,  in 1910,
 
she moved to the northern New Mexican Mormon community of
 
Carson in 1929 to work mending and repairing blankets  (Rio
 
Grande and Navajo weavings)  for several blanket traders that
 
included Claude Graves, whom she married in 1931.
 Although
 
her maternal great grandfather had been a weaver and her
 
mother had passed on her knowledge of spinning and dying wool
 
and needlework,  Frances saw her first colcha in Carson.
 "We
 
bought an old colcha in Ojo Caliente.
 Part of it needed
 
mending so we tore it apart and copied the stitch.
 We kept on
 
practicing until we got it right .
... Right after I got married
 
I started making colchas for my own use.
 I made my first one
 
on gunny sacks for the floor.
 Money was hard to get and we
 
were paying off our land.
 Claude was working for the State
 
Highway Department for $3.75 per day and I made colchas.
 A
 
store owner in Chamita wanted every colcha that I made.
 He
 
would give part cash and part trade.
.
. . I have worked on
 
colchas since then and have taught and exhibited my work."
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 9
 
As other women in the area followed her example and
 
started their own coicha cottage industries,  a "Carson coicha"
 
style emerged that incorporated new stitch patterns and new
 
motifs into the old form.
 As described in a Millicent Rogers
 
Museum exhibit,  "Carson coichas are relatively easy to
 
identify in that they reflect an Anglo sense of pictorial
 
composition and are relatively large in size when compared to
 
earlier ones.
 In addition,  the materials used in the making
 
of a Carson colcha are almost all recycled.  .
 .
 Another
 
identifying feature. .  . . is the vertical direction of the
 
stitches,  whereas in the older coicha embroideries,  the
 
stitches follow the curves of the pattern".
 
Frances Varos Graves continues to produce her distinctive
 
coichas.
 Her work has been exhibited widely,  appearing in
 
one-woman shows in Taos,  the One SpaceJThree Visions exhibit
 
at the Albuquerque Museum,  the widely-toured exhibit Spanish
  
Textile Tradition of New Mexico and Colorado at the Museum of
 
International Folk Art in Santa Fe,  and the Coicha Embroidery
 
of Northern New Mexico exhibit at the Millicent Rogers Museum,
 
among others.
 Her niece and her grandson's wife produce and
 
sell colchas,  and through her participation in the New Mexico
 
Arts Division's state apprenticeship program,  she continues to
 
pass on her "Carson colcha" tradition to future generations.
 
VIOLET  (aq
oblu)  HILBERT
 
Born in the Skagit Valley of Washington State in 1918,
 
Violet "Vi" Hilbert was part of a generation that grew up
 
speaking the Lushootseed  (Puget Sound Salish)  language,  shared
 
by several Native American tribes from the Puget Sound
 
eastward to the Cascade Mountains.
 As a child,  she was
 
surrounded by accomplished traditional orators and
 
storytellers.
 Her father was a tribal historian and one of
 
the last speakers of the Skagit Coast Salish language.
 Her
 
mother Louisa Anderson was a skilled raconteur and an
 
ebullient public speaker,  and her father Charlie Anderson
 
possessed a rich store of traditional stories and song.
 As a
 
young girl,  she traveled with her parents picking berries
 
throughout the Northwest and attended 15 schools before
 
receiving her high school diploma.
 Though she was forbidden
 
to speak her Native tongue at Indian boarding schools,  outside
 
of school she was raised according to the old values by her
 
mother and father, who valued their family history and who
 
were proud of the rich store of ancestral names and stories
 
that,  according to tribal tradition,  they owned and she would
 
inherit.
 She attended important tribal ceremonial events such
 
as funerals and naming ceremonies and was taught the strictest
 
standards of propriety that require generosity,  discretion,
 
and forebearance.
 An immense repertoire of traditional tales,
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows, page 10
 
artfulness of rhetorical style,  and the function of stories in
 
maintaining tribal history were key to her traditional
 
upbringing.
 
1.
 
In the 1960s,  years after the deaths of her parents,  her
 
concern for the rapidly diminishing number of Lushootseed
 
speakers and the infrequency of ceremonial settings for
 
oratory took her on a one-woman mission of cultural
 
preservation that continues to the present.
 "There are very
 
few places where the stories are still being told,  and the
 
people who know them are dying. .  .  .That's why I feel such a
 
sense of urgency to collect and write the remnants I know."
 
As a cultural conservator,  she is eager to remind tribal young
 
people of the aesthetic depth of storytelling and its
 
centrality to Native culture.
 "[The]  best storytellers could
 
become the characters in their stories," animating rocks,
 
trees,  and animals with subtle changes of voice and gesture.
 
At many social occasions for storytelling,  "there was duck
 
soup and bread and coffee.
 People who were hosting. .  .would
 
invite their friends and relatives to join them.
 My parents
 
would bring cattail mats for us to sleep on because the party
 
went all night."
 In keeping with her concern for making the
 
stories a part of her people's future,  she studied linguistics
 
and labored hard to translate the often subtle meanings into
 
English so that those who did not learn the language may
 
understand.
 
Vi Hu bert has taken Lushootseed stories to wide
 
audiences--non-Native and Native American--throughout North
 
America.
 She has lectured and taught at universities and on
 
her own Upper Skagit reservation,  has continued to speak at
 
tribal ceremonial events,  has transcribed,  translated,  and
 
published her stories,  and has appeared in many public events,
 
such as the National Association for the Perpetuation and
 
Preservation of Storytelling in Tennessee.
 In 1989,  she
 
received the Washington Centennial Commission's Ethnic
 
Heritage Award.
 Her people say she often reminds them of the
 
story of the race between the Bear and the Ant to dig a hole.
 
While Bear took frequent rests,  Ant never stopped to rest.
 He
 
worked so hard that he stretched himself thin,  almost to the
 
point of breaking in the middle.
 Ant won the race,  and
 
aq
oblu's unflagging energy and dedication won her the
 
affectionate title "Ant."
 
SOSEI SHIZUYE MATSUMOTO
 
In East Asian cultures,  many artistic traditions are
 
considered to be ways of achieving self-discipline as well as
 
a means of producing aesthetically engaging expressions of
 
creativity.
 There are numerous venerable examples of these
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page ii
.
 
"meditative arts," but in Japan none is more highly esteemed
 
or inclusive of different artistic media than chado, or "way
 
of the tea."
 In the words of Gerald Yoshitomi,  "The art of
 
Tea has been characterized as the very essence of Japanese
 
culture,  embodying as it does the various artistic disciplines
 
of ceramics,  architecture,  horticulture,  landscape
 
architecture,  visual art,  literature,  and calligraphy,  not to
 
mention the mental discipline which goes into the formation of
 
one's character."
 
Chado is a complex series of hundreds of steps designed
 
around the act of serving tea and requires a connoisseurship
 
of all the necessary physical accoutrements as well as acute
 
sensitivity in the disciplined interaction between its
 
participants.
 When properly practiced,  the natural setting,
 
the delicately wrought tea utensils,  the simple elegance of
 
the decorations,  and the smooth,  regulated movements of the
 
participants combine to remove the host and guests from the
 
pressures of the outside world and place them in an atmosphere
 
where each finds inner peace and tranquility.
 Historically,
 
chado has left its mark on many other art forms.  In the 16th
 
and 17th centuries,  for example,  tea masters influenced
 
theshaping of some of the most beautiful of ceramic tea ware,
 
always preferring the simple,  rustic,  and spare over the
 
highly finished and refined.
 
In the United States,  the most influential teacher and
 
accomplished master of chado is Sosei Shizuye Matsumoto.
 Mme.
 
Matsumoto was born in Honolulu,  Hawaii,  in 1920.
 Her interest
 
in cha-no-yu  (or chado)  as a young woman took her to Kyoto,
 
Japan,  where she studied for seven years to master the essence
 
of the tea ceremony,  and she received a teaching credential
 
from Tantansai,  the 14th generation Grandmaster of the
 
Urasenke School of Chado.
 After World War II,  she saw that
 
there were few practitioners of the tea ceremony among
 
Japanese-Americans in her new home of Los Angeles,  but her
 
desire to start a school was thwarted by the unsettled times,
 
with her people returning from the wartime internment camps.
 
In 1951,  she was invited to the signing of the U.S.-Japan
 
peace treaty in San Francisco,  where over a four-day period
 
she and the Urasenke Grandmaster served tea to more than 3,000
 
American and Japanese officials,  including President Truman
 
and Prime Minister Yoshida.
 That same year she opened the
 
first tea ceremony classes in the United States,  and presented
 
the tea ceremony in the Twentieth Century Fox film "East is
 
East."
 In the 1950s,  Mme. Matsumoto introduced millions of
 
Americans to chado through appearances on CBS and NBC.
 In
 
1968,  she was invited to present at the Olympic Arts Festival
 
in Mexico City.
 Her more than 40 years of teaching and
 
lecturing throughout the country has resulted in over 120
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows, page 12
 
credentialed chado teachers and thousands more tea ceremony
 
devotees.
 
Sosei Shizuye Matsumoto has received numerous awards:  a
 
special commendation from the Minister of the Department of
 
Foreign Affairs of Japan  (1960);  a Special Recognition Awaro
 
from the Urasenke School in Kyoto  (1960); the honorable x
nast r
 
of tea ceremony,  "Meiyo Shihan"  (highest teaching certificat
 
from the Urasenke School  (1989); the Japanese American
 
Cultural and Community Center's President's Award  (1989);  a

the Emperor of Japan in 1990,  the highest form of such
 
recognition.
 She has long been the major American properen
 
of the art of chado and its message of "peace from a bowl 01
 
tea."
 In the words of Chado Urasenke Los Angeles Chapter head
 
Glenn Webb,  "Mme.  Matsumoto is the very embodiment of a 'tea
 
person,'  or chajin. 
She not only knows  (and can teach)  all
 
the procedures for Chado;  she also manifests the true spirit
 
of self discipline and compassion for others,  which only a few
 
students of tea attain.
 To the extent that she embodies the
 
ideal human being as defined in traditional Japanese society,
 
she is the perfect role model."

D.L.  Menard is a singer,  a guitarist,  a writer of songs
 
that speak to the deepest sensibilities of Cajun people,  and
 
much more.
 In the minds of many,  it is especially fortunate
 
that he came along at perhaps the most critical time in Cajun
 
history since the French-speaking Acadians first migrated to
 
Louisiana from what is now Canada to escape religious and
 
cultural persecution in the late 1700s.
 Born in 1932,  he was
 
raised in the heart of Cajun country near the town of Erath,
 
when Cajun French was forbidden in schools and Cajun music was
 
said to be crude,  and when the ever-more intrusive pop culture
 
vied for the values and minds of Cajun young people.
 But D.L.
 
never consciously tried to preserve a lifestyle or to be a
 
spokesman for his people.
 His wit,  unfailing good humor,
 
generosity,  and overall make-up embodied a self-confident,
 
quintessential Cajun character that,  combined with his intense
 
musicality,  projected liveliness,  strength,  and creativity
 
into Cajun life.
 
Growing up,  D.L.  was a fan of Hank Williams and early
 
country music.
 "I first learned to sing by listening to an
 
old battery-powered wooden radio that we had.
 Every night,  I
 
turned it on to listen to Del Rio,  Texas,  and I learned those
 
songs that I heard on the radio.
 The battery would die every
 
year about a month or two before we sold the cotton.
 That was
 
the hardest time,  without the radio.
 I didn't play the guitar
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 13
 
yet,  but that's where I learned all my first songs.
 And all
 
those songs were in English.
 I couldn't hear any French songs
 
on the radio"  (from The Makers of Cajun Music by Barry Jean
 
Ancelet).
 When D.L. was 16 years old,  his parents quit
 
farming and moved into town.
 There he heard his first live
 
Cajun music and immediately fell in love with the guitar.
 He
 
ordered one from a catalog for $11.00 and learned to play.
 
His first dance job was in Abbeville with Elias Badeaux and
 
the Louisiana Aces,  embarking on a musical path that would
 
place him firmly in the era of Cajun music marked by post
 
World War II road houses,  honky-tonks,  and family dance halls.
 
At first,  D.L.  specialized in singing English language
 
songs and left the Cajun ones to the more experienced singers.
 
Soon,  he was not only applying his heartfelt voice to songs in
 
French,  but began composing new songs,  and adding French words
 
to instrumentals.
 The local popularity of one of his first
 
songs surprised everyone,  including himself.
 "In those days,
 
a [recording]  session cost $175, which included 300 records,
 
you understand,  and you could sell them.
 "La Porte d'en
 
Arriere"  (The Back Door)  came out on a Wednesday and by
 
Saturday I had my $175 back already and some extra money to
 
split among the guys in the band .
... That night,  we had to play
 
it seven times on the bandstand."
 "La Porte d'en Arriere" and
 
many of his other songs like "Un Homme Marie" and "La Vie d'un
 
Vieux Garcon," have become part of the standard traditional
 
repertoire.
 To pursue his musical interests,  D.L.  quit his
 
service station job to find another,  more flexible job.
 He
 
learned how to make chairs,  and opened a shop next to his
 
house.
 His comfortable rockers are found in homes throughout
 
the area,  and when he appears at folk festivals,  he of
'
 
demonstrates chairmaking when he's not playing music.
 
Since 1973,  D.L.  has been taking Cajun bands to
 
festivals,  including the National Folk Festival and the
 
Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife.
 He has represented
 
the U.S.  abroad,  touring for the State Department to South and
 
Central America,  Asia,  the Near East,  and Europe,  and has come
 
to be one of the most well-known representatives of Cajun
 
culture.
 In his words,  "It made us feel so proud of our
 
culture to see people from all over applauding the music we
 
brought them from south Louisiana."
 
SIMON SHAHEEN
 
The g
 (also,  ud),  a pear-shaped lute,  has been in
 
Arabic musical tradition since at least the 7th century,
 
having been borrowed from their Persian neighbors.
 The
 
long-time favor it has commanded among musicians from many
 
musical traditions,  both rural and urban,  throughout the
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 14
 
culturally diverse Arab world has given the oud great stature
 
as a vehicle for highly-developed artistry and an important
 
source of identity and common ground among Arabs and Middle
 
Easterners.
 In Arabic cultures,  most masterful musicians do
 
not feel impeded by the boundaries of categories like "folk,"
 
"classical," and "popular" as they move freely between
 
repertoires and styles intended for different occasions,  and
 
this is particularly the case with the highly adaptable oud.
 
Since his immigration to the United States in 1980,  Simon
 
Shaheen has been recognized as the premier Arabic oud virtuoso
 
in this country,  and in the words of Arabic ethnomusicologist
 
and musician Jihad Racy,  "[Shaheen]  is one of the top few
 
musicians in the entire Arab world."
 
Simon Shaheen was born in 1955 in the Arab Christian
 
village of Tarshiha in the Gau l region of Israel.
 He first
 
took up the oud at age four,  and under the tutelage of his
 
father,  Hikmet Shaheen,  a renowned teacher and composer of
 
Arabic music,  performed his first public improvisation at age
 
six.
 Simon fondly recalls studying with his father:  "It
 
wasn't like music lessons.
 My father played,  and I played,
 
too."
 After moving to Haifa,  he studied Western classical
 
violin at the  Rubin Conservatory and went on to Tel Aviv,
 
where he earned a B.A.  in music and Arabic literature.
 In
 
Israel,  he took part in an extended performance series of
 
Arabic Music for National Israeli Television and Radio between
 
1973 and 1978.
 When he came to the United States,  he earned
 
an M.A.  in Music Education from Columbia University and an
 
M.A.  in Music Performance from the Manhattan School of Music.
 
In the U.S.,  Simon has proven himself a highly versatile,
 
virtuosic,  and creative musician who knows few boundaries,
 
social or musical.
 Upon his arrival,  he mainly made his
 
living playing a wide range of social occasions for Middle
 
Easterners of many backgrounds.
 Increasingly,  his exquisite
 
talents have been recognized by critics and presenters,
 
bringing him greater opportunity to display his
 
concert-oriented,  creative side.
 New York Times critic Tim
 
Page has likened him to the Spanish guitarist Segovia,  and
 
Edward Rothstein has written of his "virtuosic
 
sophistication."
 Shaheen has composed many new works in an
 
"art music" style,  incorporating a "subtle combination of
 
traditional Near Eastern techniques with contemporary
 
[Western]  ideas of form," according to scholar Philip
 
Schuyler.
 
While he now devotes great effort to his personal musical
 
career,  his compositions,  and his Near Eastern Music Ensemble,
 
he has not let this narrow the range of his musical interests
 
nor limit his concern for his fellow Arabs in the United
 
States.
 He travels widely to perform at important Arab
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows, page 15
 
events,  and to share his skill with developing Arab musicians.
 
He has been a vital force in keeping these traditions alive.
 
In the words of his nominator Margaret Wolfson,  Mr.  Shaheen's
 
authentic cultural and musical roots,  his extraordinary skill
 
and experience as performer and teacher,  his fluency-- derived
 
from natural ability and serious study--in both Near Eastern
 
and Western musical styles,  his vibrancy as a person and
 
dedication to his musical heritage,  combine to make him an
 
ideal instrument to transmit and preserve near Eastern folk
 
music in this country."
 
LILY VORPERIAN
 
It often seems that the incomprehensible social upheaval
 
experienced by Armenian people who fled the massacres of 1910
 
in their homeland only strengthened their resolve to maintain
 
their unique cultural identity.
 In Southern California,  the
 
"Capital of the Diaspora" where over 300,000 Armenians live,
 
many of their most venerable traditions are alive and in some
 
ways flourishing.
 In 1989, Armenian oudist Richard Hagopian
 
of Fresno was recognized through a National Heritage
 
Fellowship for his tasteful musicianship and for his efforts
 
to keep traditional music a part of Armenian social life.
 In
 
Armenian crafts,  no artist commands greater respect than Lily
 
Vorperian:  inheritor,  practitioner,  and creator of
 
Marash-style embroidery.
 
Lily Kambourian was born a refugee,  in Aleppo,  Syria,  in
 
1919,  three years after her parents had fled the Armenian city
 
of Marash.
 Raised in the Armenian colony in Aleppo,  she
 
married Haroutioun Vorperian in 1937,  had four children,  and
 
was widowed in 1953.
 She moved to Beirut in 1964 and came to
 
the U.S.  in 1978,  once again escaping the disasters of war.
 
At age 12,  she began embroidering,  learning from the elderly
 
women who came to her house daily because it was a center for
 
refugee aid distribution.
 With the exception of her high
 
school years and while she was raising young children alone,
 
she has dedicated herself to her embroidery.
 Though she is
 
familiar with 18 other regional Armenian embroidery styles,
 
she always preferred that of her parents'  home town of Marash,
 
known for its tasteful color combinations,  intricate designs,
 
and complex,  demanding stitchery.
 When asked why she favored
 
the Marash style,  she answered "Because it is the hardest.
 
It's the same with cooking.
 I always want to prepare the
 
hardest things."
 
Ms.  Vorperian is a master of her craft,  an artist of
 
national and even international stature.
 In the words of
 
folklorist Susan Auerbach,  "Not only is her workmanship in a
 
complex technique superb,  but her intricate designs bring
 
-more-
1994 National Heritage Fellows, page 16
 
Marash work to a new aesthetic level,  while still keeping to
 
traditional forms.
 Marash embroidery is the vehicle through
 
which she expresses her creative energy and vision,  as well as
 
her passionate cultural pride.
 While most women who still do
 
Marash work rely on ready-made patterns or repeat a few simple
 
designs,  Lily creates her own work from start to finish and
 
takes pride in devising so many variations on Marash-style
 
design."
 Lily often boasts of the neatness of her work:  "Look
 
how clean it is on the back."
 Her Marash technique barely
 
pricks the surface of the reverse side,  even though the basis
 
of each design is interconnected herringbone stitches,  over
 
and under which the thread may be woven four or even eight
 
times.
 Clusters of squares or crosses then become the
 
building blocks for bold patterns.
 The effect is slightly
 
raised and intricate,  reminiscent of traditional Armenian
 
wood-carving,  stonework,  or jewelry engraving.
 In recent
 
years,  she has been known for her embroidery of slogans and
 
names in the Armenian alphabet that speak her sentiment
 
concerning the tragedy of her people,  such as "Oh,  Armenian
 
people,  your only salvation is in your collective strength."
 
Today,  her work motivates her more than ever.
 "I feel a
 
lot younger.
 I want to show that I can do 10 times this
 
amount if I live."
 Admiring cultural compatriots and
 
non-Armenians alike share her desire,  inviting her to exhibit
 
and demonstrate her work in festivals and exhibit sites in
 
California,  such as the Los Angeles "City Roots Festival" and
 
the Armenian Cultural Festival sponsored by the City of Los
 
Angeles.
 The Armenian Relief Society proudly displays its
 
logo,  a large Marash embroidery by Lily Vorperian.
 
ELDER ROMA WILSON
 
As is often the case with music passed on through aural
 
tradition,  an artist's creations may become more famous than
 
the artist himself.
 This is certainly the case with harmonica
 
player,  singer,  and composer Elder Roma Wilson,  whose music is
 
known to millions of Americans,  while he remained in obscurity
 
until being "rediscovered"  in the 1980s by his former partner
 
in song,  Reverend Leon Pinson.
 
Roma Wilson was born in 1910 and hails originally from
 
Tupelo,  Mississippi.
 Folklorist Worth Long recounts Wilson's
 
early musical life:  "Elder Roma Wilson learned to play the
 
harmonica as a boy with old, worn-out harps discarded by his
 
older brothers.
 He learned to  'choke'  these harps in order to
 
get traditional sounds out of them.
 He was taught by both
 
traditional secular and sacred harp masters and became known
 
throughout the state for his version of the song 'This
 
-more-
 
I
 
1994 National Heritage Fellows,  page 17
 
Train.'" A young minister as well as accomplished harpist,
 
Wilson subsequently teamed up with the young,  blind,
 
guitar-playing Reverend Pinson to travel around Mississippi
 
and Arkansas,  preaching the gospel on the "brush arbor"
 
circuit and playing the religion-inspired music for which they
 
both became known as masters.
 
In the 1940s,  he parted ways with Pinson and moved to
 
Detroit to raise his family,  making his living as a street
 
musician on Hastings Street.
 It was here that Joe Von Battle,
 
owner of Joe's Record Shop covertly recorded Wilson's
 
astonishing harp-blowing and subsequently released a 78 rpm
 
recording of  "Lily of the Valley" and "Better Get Ready," on
 
the Gotham label.
 These recordings became legendary,  and when
 
they were re-released in 1983 by St.  George Records,  the liner
 
notes stated:  "Concerning Elder R. Wilson,  nothing of a
 
background nature is available for study.
 Robert  [Richard]
 
remembered recording with a preacher,  but sadly nothing
 
else. .  .  .Hopefully more information will surface on this
 
charismatic preacher who blew harp and quite possibly had the
 
help of ascending masters,  as blues legends claim that one
 
sold one's soul  to the devil to play that well."
 Elder Wilson
 
replies:  "That ain't true.
 I' m alive and well in Mississippi
 
and still don't play no blues."
 Elder Wilson also taught his
 
sons  to play the harp,  and in another 1940s recording at Joe's
 
Record Shop,  he and his  three sons made what is now considered
 
to be an important historic 78 rpm release of what Mike Seeger
 
has called "the single most important selection by multi-harp
 
players in existence."
 
Elder Wilson and Reverend Pinson were reunited when
 
Wilson returned to Red Hill,  Mississippi,  in the 1980s.
 They
 
have since performed at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage
 
Festival,  the Chicago Blues Festival,  the Smithsonian Festival
 
of American Folklife,  the National Black Arts Festival,  and
 
other major events.
 In 1991,  the Southern Arts Federation
 
took them to venues  throughout the South as part of  the "Deep
 
South Musical Roots"  tour.
 Elder Wilson's performances  today,
 
usually coupled with his long-time partner Pinson,  move
 
audiences as much as  they ever did,  as described by David
 
Whiteis of  the Chicago Sun-Times: "Wilson,  who alternates his
 
harp blowing with 'brush arbor'  preaching in the traditional
 
southern rural style,  provides eloquent accompaniment and a
 
gentle impetus for Pinson's fretwork.
 Together they provide a
 
rare testimony to the power of music as a vehicle of  faith."

SUBJECT:
 The Effect of a National Heritage Fellowship
 
On Personal Income Tax and Eligibility for
 
Government Benefits
 
My office has researched and reviewed several issues
 
pertaining to the effect of a National Heritage
 
Fellowship on the recipient's personal income tax
 
liability as well as on the recipient's eligibility for
 
Social Security benefits,  Food Stamps,  Medicare and
 
Medicaid.
 
Recipient's Personal Income Tax Liability
  
During our meeting late in 1994,  you raised the
 
possibility that the Internal Revenue Code  ("IRC")  had
 
been amended in such a way as to provide National
 
Heritage Fellowship recipients with an exemption,  or
 
some other relief,  from the general rule of income
 
taxability with respect to their fellowship funds.
 
Section 117 of the IRC,  which pertains to fellowships
 
and scholarships,  excludes qualified scholarships from
 
the gross income of an individual who is a candidate
 
for a degree at an educational organization.
 A
 
qualified scholarship includes "any amount received by
 
an individual as a scholarship or fellowship to the
 
degree that the individual establishes that,  in
 
accordance with the conditions of the grant,  such
 
amount was used for qualified tuition and related
 
expenses."
 26 U.S.C.  §117(b)(1).
 Qualified tuition
 
and related expenses include tuition and fees for
 
enrollment or attendance at an educational facility or
 
books,  fees,  supplies and equipment for course
 
instruction at an educational institution.
 
A National Heritage Fellowship does not fit the § 117
 
definition of a scholarship or fellowship.
 Therefore,
 
the income from a National Heritage Fellowship is
 
taxable income.
 This is true of all Arts Endowment
 
-2-
individual awards.
 
Given the definition of "scholarship or fellowship"  in
 
the IRC,  the Arts Endowment would be unable to change
 
the description of the National Heritage Fellowship to
 
imply that the award is to assist further education.
 
Even if the description of the Folk Heritage Fellowship
 
were amended to include some reference to the use of
 
the award for continuing education,  the IRC definition
 
of fellowship would require that the recipient be
 
enrolled in an educational institution.
 
Under the IRC,  the Arts Endowment may request a Revenue
 
Ruling  (
"Rev.  Rul.")  to specifically exclude the
 
National Heritage awards from inclusion within the
 
recipients'  gross income.
 Generally,  obtaining a
 
Revenue Ruling is likely to take several years and
 
would require substantial legal and policy efforts to
 
justify the ruling request.
 
I believe that in the absence of a Revenue Ruling,
 
beginning with the 1995 National Heritage Fellowships,
 
the Arts Endowment should give all recipients written
  
notice that the award is taxable income.
 Written
 
notice is particularly important to National Heritage
 
Fellowship recipients because they do not apply for the
 
award and receive no other notice,  writteri or
 
otherwise,  about the award prior to th e ir select
ion  and
 
the verbal advice that the $10,000 award will be added
 
to their gross income.
 
I understand further that the grant period for National
 
Heritage Fellowships is currently one year.
 If the
 
Arts Endowment were to amend this policy and extend the
 
grant period for National Heritage Fellowships to two
 
years,  the written notice should explain that payment
 
of the $10,000 award may be requested in a lump sum or
 
in installments over the two-year period.
 Installments
 
over two calendar years may reduce the effect of the
 
additional income on the recipient's gross income and
 
therefore,  on the recipient's taxable income.
 The
 
alternative of installment payments may also be useful
 
to National Heritage Fellowship recipients in
 
determining the impact of the award on their
 
eligibility for other government benefits.
 
While the IRC does not provide an income tax exception
 
or exemption for fellowships,  such as the National
 
Heritage Fellowships,  the IRC does exclude the Arts
 
Endowment from the requirement to issue a Form 1099 to
 
the recipient and the Internal Revenue Service  (
"IRS").
 
The IRC provision concerning the issuance of 1099's may
 
-3-
have given rise to the confusion over the question of
 
taxability of the award.
 The two IRC provisions,
 
taxability of the award and duty of the agency to issue
 
a 1099,  are,  however,  mutually exclusive.
 
Effect of a National Heritage Fellowship on the
  
Recipient's Eligibility for Supplemental Security
 
Income  ("SSI")  
Supplemental Security Income  (
"SSI")  benefits are
 
available to "assure a minimum level of income for
 
people who are age 65 or over,  or who are blind or
 
disabled and who do not have sufficient income and
 
resources to maintain a standard of living at the
 
established Federal minimum income level." 20 C.F.R.  §
 
516.110.
 The mandatory eligibility guidelines of
 
national uniformity provide a minimum income base on
 
which states may build supplemental payments.
 20
 
C.F. R.  § 416.110(d).
 
Regardless of the applicant's age or disability,  the
 
applicant's income and resources must fall below a
 
certain level,  or "break even point."
 The break even
 
point for individuals is $977 per month,  if all income
 
is derived from earned income,  or $466 per month if all
 
income is derived from unearned income.
 1
'or income
 
which is both earned and unearned,  the break even point
 
is somewhere in between.
 If a Fellowship recipient
 
exceeds the Federal income eligibility guidelines,  the
 
individual may remain eligible for SSI under the
 
recipient's state supplemental plan.
 My office has
 
examined the impact of the Fellowship award on income
 
eligibility to Federal mandatory guidelines only.
 An
 
examination of state guidelines would require a state-
by-state review.
 
For purposes of SSI,  income is defines as "anything you
 
receive in cash or in kind that you can use to meet
 
your needs for food,  clothing,  and shelter."
 20 C.F.R.
 
§ 416.1102.
 Anything that cannot be used to pay for
 
food,  clothing and shelter is not income under the SSI
 
guidelines.
 The National Heritage Fellowship award is,
 
of course,  cash,  which can be used for food,  clothing
 
and shelter,  and therefore must be included in the
 
Fellowship recipient's income for SSI eligibility.
 
The National Heritage Fellowship is unearned income
 
under the SSI eligibility guidelines.
 Other examples
 
of unearned income are dividends,  interest,  rental
 
income and gifts.
 Exclusions to unearned income
 
include "emergency assistance up to $20 a month if it
 
-4-
is infrequent or irreqular [emphasis added]."
 20
 
U.S.C.  § 416.1124(c).
 An irregular and infrequent
 
payment may be received only once in a calendar quarter
 
from a single source or not be reasonably expected.
 If
 
the Fellowship is received in monthly installments,  for
 
instance,  it is expected.
 If it is received in one
 
lump sum,  it is not expected and the recipient may take
 
a $20 deduction from the unearned income exclusion.
 
With a $10,000 award,  the $20 deduction has no real
 
effect upon eligibility.
 
To continue to receive SSI payments without
 
interruption,  a Fellowship recipient must remain below
 
both the income eligibility threshold and the resource
 
eligibility threshold.
 Resources are defined as "cash
 
or other personal property that an individual  (or
 
spouse,  if any)  owns and could convert to cash to be
 
used for his or her support and maintenance."
 20
 
C.F.R.  § 416.1201(a).
 
Resources include liquid and non-liquid assets.
 Liquid
 
assets are all cash and personal property that can be
 
converted to cash within 20 days,  including checking
 
and savings accounts.
 Non-liquid assets are all
 
personal property that cannot be converted to cash
 
within 20 days.
 A single individual may not hold more
 
than $1,500 non-excludable resources and z
r
 married
 
individual may not hold more than $2,500 non-excludable
 
resources.
 Exclusions and deductions from resource
 
calculation include the value of the individual's home,
 
household goods whose aggregate value does not exceed
 
$2,000,  a car with a value not exceeding $4,500,
 
property of a trade or business or non-business
 
property which is essential to the means of self-
support,  stock in a village held by a native Alaskan,
 
life insurance,  restricted allotted Indian lands,
 
payment of benefits under a Federal statute other than
 
Social Security,  disaster relief,  burial spaces and
 
expenses,  retroactive payments,  housing assistance,  and
 
Federal income tax refunds.
 The remainder of any
 
monthly or lump sum Fellowship payment is a resource
 
which may make the recipient ineligible for SSI.
 To
 
avoid ineligibility,  a Fellowship recipient must spend
 
the majority of each monthly payment.
 
If an individual's income or resources exceed the
 
statutory break even point,  benefits will be terminated
 
or suspended.
 Unless a National Heritage Fellowship
 
recipient can "spend down" the majority of the funds
 
(received in a lump sum or installment payments),  the
 
Social Security Administration  (
"SSA")  will suspend SSI
 
payments in the first month that an individual's income
 
-5-
or resources exceed the eligibility requirements.
 
Eligibility will remain suspended until the individual
 
submits evidence to provide that he or she meets all of
 
the SSI eligibility requirements.
 If the individual
 
fails to prove his or her eligibility within 12 months,
 
the SSA will terminate the individual's SSI
 
eligibility.
 
Additionally,  individuals must notify the SSA within 10
 
days of the close of the month of a change in income or
 
in his or her resources which may�e fect 
 SSI
 
eligibility.
 If the report is la
 ,
 the SSA may impose
 
a penalty deduction from the individual's benefits.
 
The SSA conducts periodic redetermination reports.
 If
 
the SSI recipient has not reported the change in income
 
or resources,  the recipient must repay any SSI
 
overpayment.
 
Clearly,  the SSI requirements are very tight,  offering
 
almost no relief,  other than the spend down approach,
 
for those National Heritage Fellowship recipients
 
receiving SSI.
 [Note:  The only exclusions from the
 
definition of unearned income are statutory,  e.g.,
 the
 
exclusion of disaster relief from the definition of
 
unearned income.  42 U.S.C.  § 1382a]
 
Absent an immediate  (and perhaps unlikely)  statutory
 
exclusion,  the Arts Endowment should begin notifying
 
National Heritage Fellowship recipients of the impact
 
of the $10,000 award on the recipient's SSI eligibility
 
and give each recipient the opportunity to accept the
 
award in a lump sum or in smaller installments.
 
Effect of National Heritaqe Fellowship on
  
Medicaid Eligibility
  
Medicaid is a Federal-state cooperative program which
 
administers aid to individuals who cannot afford
 
qualified medical care.
 Under the statute,  the Federal
 
government develops mandatory and optional eligibility
 
criteria and the states develop medical care plans to
 
administer Medicaid to eligible individuals.
 An
 
individual may be eligible under the mandatory or the
 
optional Medicaid coverage as either categorically
 
needy or medically needy.
 The categorically needy
 
include individuals receiving Aid to Families with
 
Dependent Children  (
"AFDC")  or SSI,  pregnant women and
 
certain aliens.
 The medically needy include aged and
 
disabled individuals with income below a certain limit.
 
In either category,  because an individual's income
 
-6-
determines Medicaid eligibility,  a National Heritage
 
Fellowship recipient may lose Medicaid benefits by
 
accepting the Fellowship.
 
Furthermore,  categorically needy individuals may
 
receive Medicaid benefits under mandatory or optional
 
requirements.
 Generally,  individuals who satisfy SSI
 
eligibility requirements are mandatory categorically
 
needy for the purpose of receiving Medicaid.
 
Nevertheless,  a state may impose more stringent
 
Medicaid requirements than the SSI eligibility
 
guidelines.
 Additionally,  some individuals may qualify
 
for Medicaid under statutory or optional provisions
 
other than SSI eligibility.
 Eligibility under an
 
optional provision,  such as for the medically needy,
 
varies from state to state.
 Therefore,  although some
 
National Heritage Fellowship recipients do not receive
 
SSI,  the $10,000 award may still effect their Medicaid
 
benefits.
 
Effect of the National Heritage Fellowship on
 
Eligibility for Medicare
  
Medicare Part A is a health insurance plan determined
 
by an individual's age and eligibility for certain
 
benefits.
 If an individual is age 65 or older and
 
eligible to receive monthly Social Security Retirement
 
(
"OASDI")  benefits or Railroad Retirement benefits,  the
 
individual is automatically eligible to receive
 
Medicare Part A.
 Therefore,  award of a National
 
Heritage Fellowship cannot effect the award recipient's
 
eligibility for Medicare Part A.
 
Medicare Part B is a supplementary voluntary insurance
 
program financed from premiums paid by the enrollee and
 
contributions paid by the Federal government.
 The
 
insurance pays for medical and other health services,
 
as well as facility services furnished by ambulatory
 
surgical centers and comprehensive outpatient
 
rehabilitation facilities.
 Any individual age 65 or
 
older,  regardless of income or eligibility for Medicare
 
A,  who is a resident citizen or resident alien may
 
enroll in the Medicare Part B program.
 Therefore,
 
award of a National Heritage Fellowship cannot effect
 
the award recipient's eligibility for Medicare B.
 
Effect of National Heritage Fellowship on Eliqibility
 
for Food Stamp Proqram
 
Under the Food Stamp Program,  the U.S.  Secretary of
 
-7-
-4
 
Agriculture distributes the stamps to state agencies,
 
which administer the program to eligible low income
 
households.
 Generally,  eligible households may include
 
an individual who is over the age of 60,  but is unable
 
to purchase food or prepare meals because of a
 
disability.
 The eligibility of these individuals for
 
stamps is dependent on whether the income of those with
 
whom the individual lives does not exceed the poverty
 
line by more than 65%.
 
Categorically eligible households include individuals
 
who receive public aid or SSI benefits.
 Individuals
 
not receiving SSI benefits or public aid may receive
 
food stamps if their income does not exceed the poverty
 
line,  as defined within the Community Services Block
 
Grant Act.
 [The 1993 poverty line was $14,763.]
 
Additionally,  households with disabled or aged
 
individuals may receive food stamps if their income
 
does not exceed 30% of the poverty line.
 
Many of the inclusions and exclusions of income used to
 
determine SSI eligibility are used to determine Food
 
Stamp eligibility.
 Household income includes earned as
 
well as unearned income.
 Resources include all liquid
 
as well as non-liquid assets.
 Therefore,  National
 
Heritage Fellowship recipients should be advised that
 
acceptance of the award may destroy food stamp
 
eligibility.  As with SSI eligibility,  recipients may
 
spend down their awards  (received in either a lump sum
 
or installment)  to avoid ineligibility.
 
Effect of the National Heritage Fellowship on
  
Eligibility for Social Security Retirement Benefits
 
Social Security retirement benefits are available to an
 
individual who is fully insured and 62 years or older.
 
Social Security "Age-72" benefits are available to a
 
fully insured individual,  age 72 or older,  who is also
 
a U.S.  citizen or resident alien.
 Fully insured
 
individuals have completed a certain number of quarters
 
(3 month blocks)  to qualify for benefits.
 Eligibility
 
is determined by length of employment rather than
 
income.
 Therefore,  the National Heritage Fellowship
 
would not effect a recipient's eligibility for
 
retirement or Age-72 retirement benefits.
 
Effect of National Heritage Fellowship on Eligibility
 
for Social Security Disability Benefits
  
Social Security Disability benefits are granted to
 
-8-
disabled individuals regardless of income.
 An
 
individual is eligible for disability benefits if the
 
individual is fully insured,  is under the age of 65,
 
has a disability as defined by the SSA and has been
 
disabled for five months prior to retirement.
 There is
 
no income eligibility test
 Therefore,  the National
 
Heritage Fellowship would not effect eligibility for
 
Social Security Disability benefits.
 
Conclusion 
The $10,000 National Heritage Fellowship is taxable as
 
income to the recipient.
 Further,  the award of a
 
National Heritage Fellowship may effect the recipient's
 
eligibility for several benefits,  including SSI,
 
Medicaid and Food Stamps.
 Therefore,  the award letter
 
to Fellowship recipients should include the following
 
information.
 
The Internal Revenue Code provides that the full
 
amount of the National Heritage Fellowship is
 
taxable income.
 If you have any questions about
 
your own tax liability you should contact the
 
Internal Revenue Service or your own tax counsel.
 
Receipt of the National Heritage Fellowship may
 
effect your eligibility for state and Federal
 
benefits,  including Supplemental Security Income
 
("SSI"),  Medicaid and Food Stamps.  If you have any
 
questions about your eligibility for state and
 
Federal benefit programs you should contact the
 
Social Security Administration or your granting
 
state agency.
 
Finally,  if,  after further discussion with the Grants
 
Office,  the appropriate Deputies and the Chairman,  the
 
Arts Endowment decides to extend the grant period for
 
National Heritage Fellowship recipients from one year
 
to two years,  a final sentence should be added to the
 
award letter offering the choice of a lump sum payment
 
or installment payments over a period of not longer
 
than two years.
