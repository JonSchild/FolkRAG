[Letter from John A. Lomax to Harold Spivacke]
Port Aransas, Texas 3/28/ 19 39
Dear Harold: Notice of the shipment of the machine came this morning. Thank you
sincerely.
Also a special air mail from Dornbush asking that a decision be made this week. I've done
my best, as the enclosed copies of correspondence till show. His letter raises several new
points which may be impossible to solve in so short a time. I am sending to Dornbush the
original letter to me from Broome of San Angelo.
Yours in great haste, Lomax
