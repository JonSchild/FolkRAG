00:00:00 -- Introductory Slate // Interview Lede 
00:01:30 -- Early Lives in Gujarat, India; Coming to Ohio 
●
Kamal -- b. 1956 in Ahmedabad, Gujarat; business degree; came to America in 2001; but, 
before that, worked in family businesses (movie theatres; and engineering businesses) in 
Ahmedabad, and in construction. Kamal was not involved in the restaurant business in India.
●
Ami -- born in Ahmedabad; father was a lawyer; completed her schooling at Jay Commerce 
College and law school; and practiced criminal law with her father and brother. Came to 
Ohio, along with her husband, in 2001. Did not know how to cook in India; had cooks in the 
house in her in-laws’ house; but the family loved eating, so Ami learned how to cook -- she 
cooked her mother-in-law & mothers’ recipes, and started a restaurant in Ohio
●
00:04:00 -- Came to Ohio to follow their only son, and because other family members lived 
in Columbus; opening/purchasing a restaurant was a clear path to having a legal status in the 
U.S.; this was a chief motivator for why they established a restaurant in Columbus, even 
though neither Kamal or Ami had been involved in the restaurant industry; Banana Leaf 
became the “ﬁrst all-vegetarian restaurant in Ohio since 1998”
●
00:06:00 -- Growing up vegetarian; discussion of “Hindu vegetarianism” (no eggs; no ﬁsh; 
but dairy is OK); vegetarianism as a part of the culture of Hinduism -- “you have no right to 
take somebody’s life, so you cannot take somebody’s life, because life is given by God.” 
Indian cuisine oﬀers complete meals for vegetarian -- “rice, vegetables, lentils, and bread.” 
●
00:11:00 -- Kamal discusses  widespread Indian vegetarian cuisines; but also, regional 
diﬀerences between North/South/West Indian vegetarian cuisines, based on geographical 
and lifestyle diﬀerences 
●
00:13:35 -- Common meals growing up in Kamal & Ami’s families in Ahmedabad, Gujarat; 
discussion of prevalence, in Gujarat, of most women only working in the home. Kamal 
discusses the “complete meal,” which used to consist of rice, lentil, vegetable and bread; and 
light dinners, featuring dishes like kitcheree. “Breakfast like a king, lunch like a lord, and 
supper like a pauper” in Indian society; practice in Gujarat was to have very light dinners; but 
practices have changed. Ami reﬂects on a similar pattern (00:16:30) but also shares about 
unique foodways in Gujarat, including some “sweet” elements being put into everything, 
including vegetable dishes, using jaggery. 
00:17:40 -- Starting Out in Ohio: Purchasing Annapurna (2001) ; Opening Banana Leaf/
Moving to Bethel Road (2006); Learning to Build Out a Menu 
●
Starting a restaurant without much experience, but building the menu from parents’ 
experiences, even when household cooks had traditionally done most of the work.
●
Kamal -- prime purpose of having a restaurant used to be so that they could stay in the U.S. 
and be with their son; but also believed deeply in “doing things the right way”: took all the 
proper managerial courses, got licenses, etc.; from 2001-2006, worked with Ami’s            
brother and mother-in-law to learn many dishes
●
Ami reﬂects on diﬀerences between her family’s and Kamal’s families foodways; her mother 
would never eat any food from outside the house or in restaurants
●
Kamal reﬂects on growing up eating a wide variety of cuisines in his house, including Italian 
cuisine -- this is something he carries on, from his mom, in Banana Leaf’s catering business; 
some of his mom’s recipes (including “desi pizza,” with wheat crust, home-made pizza sauce, 
and Indian cheese) are on the Banana Leaf menu
●
00:23:00 -- Kamal discusses some of the ways Banana Leaf’s restaurant and catering 
company are unique; for example, oﬀering “Village-style” Indian food and “very traditional” 
home cuisine; and discusses the “chaat buﬀet” that Banana Leaf is known for -- putting lots of 
varieties of foods together!
●
00:25:19 -- Developing the Banana Leaf menu, since 2001; early history of Banana Leaf as 
Annapurna Restaurant, started by a fellow Gujarati emigrée, started in 1998 in Columbus 
Square. Ami and Kamal bought Annapurna in 2001, and inherited their vegetarian Indian 
menu; and then added a few more dishes. In 2006, Banana Leaf moved to Bethel Road, and 
acquired its new name, to better communicate its South Indian menu. 
00:27:16 -- Kitchen Work Cultures at Banana Leaf 
●
00:27:16 -- Ami: on transitioning from being a lawyer to learning how to run the kitchen, 
perfect the recipes, and train employees
●
00:29:27 -- Moving to becoming managers and not working full-time in the kitchen; and 
behind-the-scenes catering business; and selecting/training cooking staﬀ who explicitly are 
not trained chefs -- “our restaurant runs only with the Indian housewives” (and other 
housewives -- Pakistani, Bangladesh, Mexican, American); trained by Ami
●
00:31:30 -- on training non-professional cooks to be Banana Leaf’s chefs; how Kamal and 
Ami select employees, based on Banana Leaf’s menu of “homestyle” food -- “all the Indian 
housewives know about that; all they have to do is incorporate our style of recipes; what Ami 
wants”; discussion of large population of Indian-Americans in Columbus and wide pool of 
“housewives” seeking work outside the home; hiring out workers from staﬃng companies for 
big events (catering for 500 people, etc.)
●
00:33:58 -- Wages and employee payment at Banana Leaf; keep food costs between 15-25%; 
keeping cost of labor around 25-30% -- “not more than that”; most of Banana Leaf’s business 
is in catering, not in the restaurant, so there’s not alot of overhead except when catering 
demands are high; main chef paid around $16/hour; basic wages (about $9/hour) for everyone 
else, with some bonuses “depending on what sort of eﬃciencies they have provided.”
●
00:35:30 -- divisions and role distinctions between front-of-house and back-of-house staﬀ; 
one cross-trained staﬀ member
00:36:30 -- Banana Leaf Cooking Classes // Vegan Indian Cooking Education 
●
00:36:50 -- Kamal’s connection with the vegan meet-up group in Columbus; and their 
invitation to Kamal and Ami to start a cooking class
●
00:37:40 -- how Ami trained, via looking at cooking shows, for how to put on a cooking class
●
00:38:30 -- Kamal, on learning how to teach the philosophy of healthy Indian vegetarian 
cooking; with a theme that a healthy meal can be cooked at home in under 45 minutes; goal 
was to inspire conﬁdence in the class’s students, and to show simple ways to prepare Indian 
vegetarian food -- access is key! “We cook from scratch, in front of you.”
●
00:39:54 -- oﬀer of on-call email and on-site support from Ami and Kamal, post-cooking 
classes
●
00:40:50 -- goal is to teach access to healthy food; most restaurants use frozen/ready-made 
food, “not good for your health”
00:41:00 -- Healthy Food // Sourcing Ingredients for Banana Leaf 
●
00:41:30 -- working with local Indian grocery stores, like India Grocers on Sawmill Road in 
Columbus; and ordering in special ingredients
●
00:41:50 -- sourcing fresh vegetables and other ingredients in bulk at Restaurant Depot; “one 
of the most economical”; other ingredients sourced from Sam’s Club
●
00:42:31 -- “our inventory is very much analyzed; we just have to push in the requirements, 
and it is here”
●
00:42:47 -- no walk-in cooler and freezer; so, no space for pre-made dishes made the day 
before
00:43:20 -- Audience for Banana Leaf & Changes in Offerings: Catering, Buffet Meals 
●
00:43:30 -- Who is the major audience for Banana Leaf? Many Indian consumers, of course; 
but lots of vegans and vegetarians, as well -- many of whom are not Indian
●
00:44:12 -- changes in interest in vegetarian/vegan cuisine in Columbus, since 2001
●
00:44:53 -- more details on Banana Leaf’s catering company -- not just vegan Indian cuisine; 
but also Kosher food
●
00:47:12 -- changes in the Banana Leaf buﬀet; originally, ﬁve years ago, changed restaurant 
hours from 3pm-9pm, since their grandson was born; recently, Banana Leaf opened the 
kitchen for lunch again, since their prep staﬀ has to be there in the morning -- Kamal 
decided to oﬀer a “protein power”-themed lunch buﬀet, to convince skeptical new 
vegetarians! “There are many people in this world who do not know the consumption of 
lentils as a part of their diet … the Hindu vegetarians back in Indian, we get lots of proteins 
from lentils. And India is the only country which cultivates and grows over 20 kinds of 
lentils. And, if you put it’s form, there are 40-50 diﬀerent types of forms; so, lentil can be a 
whole lentil, and a split lentil. In our protein power lunch buﬀet, we put three lentils, all the 
time …”
●
00:49:50 -- Ami, on training cooking staﬀ to cook buﬀet meals
00:50:12 -- Perspective on their 18+ Years, Now, in Columbus’ Restaurant Industry 
●
00:50:20 -- More options, such as online delivery service
●
00:50:50 -- Kamal & Ami have become much more social; they are known, and provide 
catering, all across Ohio; “we are the oldest Indian restaurant in Columbus in business”; 
Kamal also serves on many non-proﬁt boards and with the local Gujarati community board, 
and in refugee services non-proﬁt work in Columbus
●
00:52:10 -- Kamal’s plan to open a branch of Vegetarian Vision in Columbus, which would 
deliver information about vegetarian nutrition in Columbus’ public school system (ages 8-12): 
information about vegetarianism, and dietary information regarding healthy options for 
foods
●
00:53:30 -- changes in reception of Indian food and regional dishes in Columbus; “now, 
people eat Indian food as a healthy option” (whereas, before, Kamal saw non-Indian Ohioans 
eating Indian food as a sort of “adventure”)
●
00:54:40 -- on being one of the ﬁrst restaurants in Columbus to mark up their menu, in the 
early 2000’s, according to what is vegan // what is vegetarian; now, Kamal reﬂects, you see 
this everywhere
●
00:55:24 -- Gluten-free options; “most of Indian food, except for bread, is gluten-free by 
nature”; most Indian food is Kosher, as well; most fried Indian food is coated in chickpea ﬂour 
(besan), not white ﬂour. Kamal and Ami also worked to develop bread recipes out of 
“naturally gluten-free” ﬂours: chickpeas, buckwheat, etc. 
●
00:57:42 -- Balancing “authentic” family recipes and innovations for the menu
00:58:16 -- Food Futures: Concern About Healthy Food Access // Community Vegan 
Kitchens 
●
00:58:30 -- Kamal’s concerns about unhealthy eating in our contemporary moment; “you 
have to follow the vegetarians … who have been vegetarians, for decades and decades.”
●
00:59:00 -- Kamal shares plan/vision for “healthy food kitchens,” similar to food pantries, to 
be run by non-proﬁts; but wants to see them serving fresh, healthy, vegetarian food; 
concerned about food access being healthy.
●
01:00:00 -- Futures for Banana Leaf: plans to open new locations; but also working on 
developing options for franchising, etc., to get themselves out of the kitchen and the 
restaurant; but they want to make clear that they can run everything in the business by 
themselves, even if the rest of the staﬀ disappeared
●
01:02:37 -- “My main focus is how to eat healthy food; and access to healthy food to the 
people.” Kamal encourages people to check out his blog via Banana Leaf’s Instagram page, 
for more thoughts on his future non-proﬁt, and working to make healthy food access 
possible for the majority of people. More reﬂections on the healthy food kitchen and bulk 
requirements as critical for the economic success of a restaurant or endeavor; “just for the 
food, not for the experience” -- larger corporations will help ﬁll in the gaps of the budget, to 
make the vegan kitchen aﬀordable to community members (much more so than regular for-
proﬁt restaurants) -- “less than $5 for a meal. At today’s cost structure, I can do it.”
