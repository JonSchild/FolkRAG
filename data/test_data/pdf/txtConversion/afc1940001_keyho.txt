21E-A2P. F. THE KEYHOLE IN THE DOOR We left early, the hour was scarcely nine,Then by some
happy fortune, her room was next to mine,And I like bold Columbus, new regions to explore,I took
that bold position at the keyhole in the door.I waited there most patiently upon my bended knee;I
waited there most patiently to see what I could see.She first took off her collar, it fell down on the
floor,I saw her stoop and get it through the keyhole in the door.Then before the fireplace her little
feet to warm,With nothing but her chemise on to hide her naked form.Oh, do take off that chemise,
I'll ask for nothing more , And then I saw her do it through the keyhole in the door.Now all you men
of science that strain your eager eyes , A-viewing of the planets that deck the starry sky , Talk of your
wealth and all your worldly lore,But a telescope is nothing to the keyhole in the door.
