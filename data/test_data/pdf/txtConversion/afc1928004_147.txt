PREFACE. 
All the songs in bis book are sung in connection with CHAS. M AC 
EVOY'S ORIGINAL " H IBERNICON." 
This exhibition. as the name im-
plies, has reference to Ireland ; and is, in fact, a 
panorama of Irish 
scenery, and with its many adjuncts, illustrates the scenery, music, 
and antiquith‘s of Ireland. 
It was the first exhibition of the kind ever presented to an Ameri-
can audience, and was gotten up with great care, after years of mature 
study and deliberation. 
The sketches, engravings and photographs were imported from 
London and Dublin, expressly for the work, and executed on canvas, 
at a 
vast outlay, by the celebrated French Scenic Artists, MM. Dn. 
flocq & Fouchere, of the Grand Opera House, Paris. 
Many of the `• Historical_ Pictures," added to the series from time 
to time are from the pencils of the best European Artists. 
To give vitallity to the exhibition and render it acceptable to all 
classes, both young and old, a " Dramatic Episode," written expressly 
for it, and entitled " Irish Hearts, or, Love in the Ould Sod," is per-
formed in connection with the panoramic views as they pass before 
the spectator—introducing also, appropriate, patriotic, sentimental 
and comic songs, many ot them original, and nearly all of which will 
be found in this collection. 
These adjuncts to the paintings, improved upon by many years of 
experience, have proved to be an important element in the success of 
the Original " Hibernicon." 
'l'o produce a 
refined Irish entertainment of this style, of only two 
hours duration, and give in that short time glances at the most 
beautiful scenery of the •• Emerald Isle," reminiscences of her glorious 
past history, together with life- like sketches of the grave and humor-
ous sides of the character of her extraordinary people, is no small 
task. 
Yet, all these things have been successfully accomplished in the 
" 
Hibernicon," and from its first exhibition in 1860, to the present 
time, has delighted hundreds of thousands of people, and received the 
highest encomiums of the entire press of the United States and 
Canada. 
Its extraordinary success since the " Inaugural Exhibition" given 
in New York, in 1863, has recently induced unpriocipl d speculators 
to imitate it. 
And, although the title, episode, and other accessoriew 
are protected by the latest " copyright" laws, 
these miserable 
" 
Frauds" usurp the legal rights of the proprietor under cover of 
mere technicalities, palm off their miserable daubs and plagiarisms on 
the public as the genuine article. 
Hence the word " Original" is 
used to distinguish it from the many counterfeits now traveling 
through the country, 
CHARLES MAcEVOY, 
Sole Proprietor and Manager.

CHARLES MAC EVOY'S 
FAMOUS ORIGINAL ‘ 1
-1IBERNICON: 
Mac Evoy's " Hibernicon."—This entertainment is decidedly one 
of the finest of the kind ever exhib.ted in New York.—Dentocrat. 
Aug. 9, 1808, 
Mr. MacEvoy's " Hihernicon" proved exceedingly pleasing to its 
auditors. 
It is a careful y 
painted and strongly meritorious pano-
rama, which in the presentation is illustrated by speech and by song 
--New York Tribune, Sep. 29, 1868. 
Whoever wttnesses it once will not fail to go again, and bring their 
friends.— Irish People, Oct. 3, 1868. 
It has suddenly made a dive into public favor, and from present 
indication it will stick there interminably, historically, musically, 
poet ic a ily, sentimentally. comically and pictorially, it forms a diver-
sion that young and old both profit by.—New York Courier, Sept. 27, 
1868. 
As we predicted a 
few weehs ago this exhibition has proved a 
decided saccess.—aVeiv York herald, :
seta. 1868 . 
MacEvoy's " Hibernicon” is 
exceedingly well patronized—Roger 
Williams' Hall being nightly nearly tull—a success which is no more 
than the very great and diversified attractions of the entertainment 
richly merit — Providence ( ltd.) Journal, April 7, I869, 
Chas MacEvoy's " Hibernicon."—The institute was again filled in 
ev-ry part last night, by an atr.ience who appeared to be highly 
deligit fed wita the whole performance. 
Indeed, they could not be 
otherwise for from wh-itever point it might be regarded " excellent" 
is the word that naturally arises ti eXpre8S the degree of merit with 
which it is viewed.-- St. John ( N. B.) Daily Horning News, &lay 21,1869. 
No better evidence can be given of " love of country" than is 
afforded in the triumphant success of MacEvoy's " Ilibernicon."

EXTRACTS, &C. [CONCLUDED. 
We 
really do not remember when we have been more charmed than 
by the " Hibernicon" last night, at , Alas • uic Temple. 
it is a grand 
panorama of " I 
tuld Ireland," the blessed land of song and scenery, of 
wits and poets, orators. statesmen and heroes, who stand unrivaled. 
Louisoile ( 1(y .)Sun, Dec. 7, 1869. 
For the first time we were a 
spectator from beginning to end, last 
evening, 
at MacEvoy's Original " Iliberiticon" on exhibition at 
Masonic Hall— his panorama is unexceptionably, in artistic execution 
and the variety of seenerY pictured the most attrac:ive that has ever 
been unfolded in New Orleans.—Xew Orleans Commercial Bulletin, 
Jad. 21, 187J. 
To say that tho " flit ernicou" is a grand success does not express 
the whole truth. 
The scenery and music is of the highest order. 
The tour through Ireland will well repay any one without the fine 
music, or the side-splitting, fun-provoking utterances of " Barney 
the Guide."—Daily Constitution, Mobile, Ala. Feb. 18, 1870. 
MacEvoy's Original " Hibernicon."—We are glad to perceive that 
this entertainment is receiving the patronage which its merits so 
richly deserve 
The panorama itself is a 
faithful delineation of that 
unequalled natural scenery \ hich has made Ireland famous the world 
over.— St Louis ( Ito.) Republican, Nov 1569. 
In days like these so replete with advertised humbugs, it is truly 
pleasing \Alien one wishes to spend all hour in some profoundly in-
tellectual amusement, not to find oneself duped anew. Such indeed 
were our felings, when lately in company with some friends we 
enjoyed the numberless scenic beauties of the celebrated MacEvoy's 
" 
Iiibernieon.—St. Louis Times, Nov. 18, 1869. 
The exhibition is rather tin quo, being a 
Panoramic View of a 
jour-
ney through Ireland ; being teal in so much as the genuine Irish 
Guide, whose odd sayings and witticisms are calculated to mahe a 
wooden man laugh. 
The views are fine and well put up, and the ex-
hibition is 
yell worth the attendance of all who wish to combine 
amusement and instruction.—Indianapolis ( Ind.) Sentinel, Nov. 30, 
1869, 
Chas. MacEvoy's " ITibernicon" still continnes to draw large crowds 
of delighted visitors. 
The entertainment consists of a 
Panorama in 
five parts, giving views of all the chief objects of interest in Ireland. 
It is well executed, al.d from the delicrlited ejaculations id various 
auditors we judge the views are accurate. 
A sort of running; accom-
paniment is gi vett in thejoys and s.irrows of " Barney the guide," and. 
t e 
varied success lie meets wit h in wooing Nora. 
This is acted 
with spirit and is extremely laugha .
1e.— Daily Gazette, Cincinuatti, 
O., Dee. 30, 1870. 
Last night. MacEvoy's " Eihernicon" was presented to an admiring 
anti appreciative audience, who testified their approval by loud 
appla 
and nproarous laughter at 
the 
comic delineations 
of 
"Barney the Guide." 
The painting, as a 
work of art, is decidedly the finest ever exhibit-
ed in this city, and as an illustration VC may mention the fact that 
several tunes amine- the evening persons famiiiar with portions of 
Ireland called out the mimes before the lecturer had time to announce 
the scene presented before them 
We heard of one enthusiastic 
lady who said site could inur,ine herst if walhing on Sackville street, 
in the beantitul city. while looh itg at he twautiful representation on

DEAR OLD ISLE. 
Music by J. G. M AEDER. 
Oh! a 
blessing fall upon thee now, 
My dear old isle, 
Tho' in grief aid care thy children bow, 
My dear old isle. 
While far away beyond the sea, 
In pleasant dreams I 
visit thee, 
And best of lands thou art to me, 
My dear old isle. 
It's a 
blessing on thy pretty girls, 
My dear old isle, 
For of womankind they are the pearls, 
My dear old isle. 
Their lips are sweet as morning dew, 
Their loving hearts are warm and true, 
The fairest girls I 
ever knew, 
My dear old isle. 
Should a 
roving heart thy sod forget, • 
My dear old isle, 
May a 
cloud upon his way be set, 
My dear old isle. 
The storms that fold thy hills to-day, 
Shall melt iu tranquil suns away, 
So blessings on thee now we may, 
My dear old isle. 
41 PHAT BOY ZEPHYR GLIDE." 
SONG AND DANCE . 
Composed expressly for the " Phat Boy " by CHAS. McEvoy. 
I'm just sixteen and growing still, increasing every way, 
Two hundred sixty-one my mark, I 
made it but to- day ; 
My friends they say if I 
should live till I 
am twenty-one, 
And have my he lth, I'll surely be a 
member of the ton. 
Ye votaries of Terpsichore, who linger at her throne, 
Some weighty thoughts, if you will wait I'll give you of my own, 
For I 
will prove the poetry of motion don't reside 
Alone with meagre form and limb, behold the Zephyr glide. 
The great Celeste and Ellsler, too, were naught compat ed to me, 
For I 
was twins when I 
was bor i
, as you can plainly see. 
With many sighs they viewed my size, and wondered as I 
grew, 
That I 
should be a 
single boy yet big Dough for two. 
I 
took to steps before my time by rolling , own the stairs, 
And won the prize from prying eyes, at State and County fairs, 
This light fantastic toe is mine, my fortune and my pride, 
But don't encore, I 
beg you won't, the " Phat Boy Zephyr Glide."

KATE O'CONNOR. 
(Recitation) 
Written for the Original " Ilibernicon" by IluGH ROBINSON, San Fran. 
ei:ico, Cal. 
Up from a 
valley where beauty's smile, 
In that gem of the ocean, the Emerald Isle, 
The clustered spires of Conamara stand, 
Green-walled by the hills of Ireland. 
Fields of grain o'er the valley sweep, 
And honest toilers everywhere you meet ; 
It was years ago, in ninety-eight. 
When the world wept for poor Emmett's fate. 
When guilty Morbury from vengeance fled, 
Fitzgerald fought and glorious Wolfe Tone bled; 
When an aged hand struck for Ireland's weal, 
And flashed in defiance her native steel. 
Kate O'Connor four-score years and ten, 
Waved the Emerald banner in the lion's den ; 
Bravest of all when the Red Coats came, 
And the men stood back with a 
blush of shame. 
She nobly stood in her cottage door ; 
Write on her tomb " true to the core ;" 
Up the street came the soldiers' tread, 
With a 
scion of Britain riding at their head. 
From under his plume of red and white, 
lie glanced, and the flag of Erin met his sight ; 
Halt 
Each one holds his breath, 
And awaits the order that sends withering death 
To the noble soul in the cottage door, 
With the waving gem of the shamrock shore. 
[
1] 
KATE O'CONNOR,— [CONCLUDED. 
Fire—outblazed the leaden blast. 
It rent the banner from her feeb:e grasp. 
But ere it reached its native soil 
Kate O'Connor, who did not recoil. 
Raised it up with a 
loyal will, 
And spoke in tones that were clear and shrill, 
" 
Shoot if you will this oil grey head ; 
This flag don't fall until I 
am dead.'" 
A shade of sadness and a 
blush of shame, 
Over the face of the Briton came. 
The very soldiers gave a 
heartfelt sigh, 
When they saw their bullets had passed her by. 
The leader turned and in a 
quiet tone 
Bade his soldiers to go marching on. 
The soldiers passed, and that green flag tossed, 
Over the head of King George's host. 
4 
And ever it's green folds rose and fell 
Over the head of her who loved it well. 
Kate O'Connor's work is o'er, 
And Britain's leader is no more. 
Honor to her : and o'er her grave 
That flag triumphant yet shall wave. 
When the cry " to arms." comes for Erin's weal, 
Midst the thunder of cannon and clash of steel. 
Her spirit will hover o'er the fight. 
Blessing those who strike for Ireland's right. 
And when Erin's struggle is at hand 
Thousands will flock from every land. 
Heroes will rise on every shore. 
And swear Erin's Isle free for evermore.

PADDY MILES. 
From the big town of Limerick lately I 
came, 
I 
left Ireland solely bekase of in 
name, 
For if anything wint wrong, or a 
mischief 'fives done, 
Shure they'd have all the blame on my mother's own son. 
So my pante now is Paddy O'Connor, 
'Pon an Irishman's thrue word and honor, 
Oh, misfortune my cam se light upon her, 
'Twas she christened, me Paddy Miles. 
If a 
windy was Imoke, or a 
house robbed of tiles, 
And you'd ax who done that, shure they'd say Paddy Miles; 
Who was it set fire to his reverence's wig. 
And cut the tail of Pat Flanigan's pig. 
Who called Mishes Muloney a 
scollop, 
And gave Biddy McGoe's cat the jallop, 
Some blackguards would hit me a 
wollop, 
And say it was you, Paddy Miles. 
I 
worked in the bogs and behaved, as I 
thought, 
From my master Mick Flynn. a 
character brought, 
But it done me no good, and I 
thought that was odd, 
Bo I 
made up my mind for to lean the mild sod. 
For the devil a 
wan would employ me, 
The girls there they would saim;3 me, 
They threatened at once to dest-oy me 
All bekase I 
was called Paddy Miles. 
Who cut oil one of the tails of Pat Finegan's coat, 
And who broke the left horn of Ned SLoughnessy's goat, 
Who through the back door to the chapel get 
And drank all the wine, blood and ounds what a 
sin,, 
Who half-tunrdered a 
poor-house inspector, 
And tired at a 
police detector, 
When Miss Fagan they tried to eject her, 
Who was it, but you, Paddy Miles. 
I 
trotted to Dublin to look for a 
place, 
Tho' they'd ne'er saw me there, faix, they all kttas- *4 'a 
C4 
The jackeens kept calling meself to annoy, 
There's !roes Paddy Miles he's a 
Limerick boy. 
Till I 
flourish my sprig M' 
An' smattered their gobs so genteelly, 
When the blood it began to flow freely, 
Said I, how do you like Paddy Miles. 
In short, brqore long to this country I 
came, 
An' found Paddy Milt- s 
here was the same; 
If my name wasn't changed I 
was likely to starve, 
For bad lack to the master could I 
sarve. 
So Paddy O'Connor it is made, sir, 
An' if you want to got a 
smart blade, sir, 
Be my soul then you need not be afraid, sir, 
For to hire me, I'm not Paddy Miles. 
WE HAVE LIVED AND LOVED TOGETHER. 
We have lived and loved torzether, 
Throng,h many changing years; 
We have shared each other's gladness, 
And wept each other's tears. 
I 
have never known a 
sorrow 
That was long unsoothed by thee, 
nit was long unsoothed by thee: 
For thy smile can make a 
summer, 
Where darkness else would be.

- 
Reimer,. 
Like the leaves that fall around us, 
In Autumn's fading hours, 
Are the traitor smiles that darken, 
When the cloud of sorrow lowers ; 
And though many such we've known, love, 
Too prone, alas ! to rane-e, 
Too prone, alas! to range, 
We both can speak of one, love, 
Whom time could never change. 
Repeat. 
GOOD-BYE, SWEETHEART, GOOD-BYE. 
The bright stars fade, the morn is breaking, 
The dew-drops pearl each bud and leaf, 
And I 
from thee my leave am taking 
With bliss too brief, 
With bliss, with bliss too brief. 
How sinks my heart with fond alarms, 
The tear is biding in mine eye : 
For, time cloth thrust me from thine arms: 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye 
Good-bye, sweet-heart, good-bye! 
For, time doth thrust me from thine arms, 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye! 
The sun is up, the lark is soaring, 
Loud swells the song of chanticleer: 
The lev'ret bounds o'er earth's soft flooring, 
Yet I 
am here, 
Yet I 
am here, yet I 
am here. 
For, since night's gems from heaven did fade 
And morn to floral lips cloth hie, 
I 
could not leave thee, though I 
said: 
" 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye, 
Good-bye, sweet it 
good-bye." 
I 
could not leave thee, though I 
said: 
"Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye."

From an aged father's bp— 
As welcome as the haven

To the swords of the Brigade. 
See their shattered forces flying, 
A broken, routed line— 
See England, what brave laurels

From the chivalry of Erin, 
And France's " FLEUR DE LIS !"

And thought upon our brethren

And others girding swords. 
The trumpet blast has sounded 
Our footmen to array — 
The willing steed has bounded, 
Impatient for the fray_ 
The green flag is unfolded, 
While rose the cry of joy : 
"Heaven speed dear Ireland's banner,

We looked upon that banner, 
And the memory arose 
Of our homes and perished kindred, 
Where the Lee or Shannon flows; 
W e looked 
upon that banner, 
And we swore to God on high, 
To smite to-day the Saxons' might, 
To conquer or to die! 
Loud swells the charging trumpet— 
'Tis a 
voice from our own land— 
God of battles—God of vengeance, 
Guide to day the patriot's brand; 
There are stains to wash away 
There are memories to destroy, 
In the best blood of the Briton,

Plunge deep the fiery rowels, 
In a 
thousand reeking flanks— 
Down chivalry of Ireland, 
Down on the British ranks—

Bad luck to his treat, it cost Inc all my tin. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Well, the green curtain drew up. and a 
lady I 
spied, 
When a 
man came to kiss her she scornfully cried, 
" 
Get out, you big blackguard, I'll bother your jig," 
When in comes Pizzaro with a 
grunt like a 
pig. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
In the days of mild Goury a 
long time ago, 
The Spaniards claimed war. ' gainst Peru you know; 
They demanded its cash, its jewels and keys, 
When a 
boy they called howler, says, " No. if you please." 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Howler came on. like a 
day- star appeared, 
Be made a 
long speech, and the sogers all cheer'd, 
Says he. " beat well the Spanimils, and do the neat thing, 
And then boys, stand up for your oountry and King. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Mr. Murphy Alonzo, somehow went to jail, 
He got out by a 
back door withent giving bail, 
While howler was jumping oe'r bridges and greens, 
He was shot by sonic blackguard behind the big screen& 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then howler came forward, and with him a 
child. 
Looking all for the world like a 
man that was w:ld ; 
" 
Here's your gossoon, dear ( lora, for it's my blood that's spllt. 
In defence of your child, blood- an ounds I'm kilt." 
Derry down, down, down. derry down. 
, 
Then Alonzo, and Pizzaro, had a 
terrible fight, 
Pizzaro got killed, that seemed perfectly right. 
For the audience came down with showers of applause, 
They were all enlisted in the Pernviahs cause 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Alonzo came forward and handsomely bowed, 
Saving, " Ladies and gentlemen," meaning the crowd; 
" 
By your kind permission, to- morrow, then, 
We will murder Pizzarro over again."

WREN YOU AND I WERE YOUNG, MAGGIE. 
I 
wandered, to-day, to the hill, Maggie, 
To watch the scenes below: 
The creek and the creaking old mill, Maggie, 
As we used to, long ago. 
The green grove has gone from the hill, Maggie, 
Where first the daisies sprung: 
The creaking old mill is still, Maggie. 
Since you and I 
were young! 
CHORUS. 
And now we are aged and gray, Maggie. 
And the trials of life nearly done : 
Let us sing of the days that are gone, Maggie, 
When you and I 
were young! 
A 
city so silent and lone, Maggie, 
Where the young and the gay and the best, 
In polished white mansions of stone, Maggie, 
Have each found a 
place of rest, 
Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie, 
And join in the songs that were sung. 
For, we sang as gay as they, Maggie, 
When you and I 
were young! 
And now we are aged, &a 
They say I 
am feeble with age, Maggie, 
My steps are less sp tightly than then: 
My face is a 
well written page, Miggie, 
But time alone was the pen! 
They say we are aged and gray, Maggie, 
As sprays by th white breakers flung: 
But to me you're f 
dr as you were, Maggie, 
When you and I 
were young! 
And now we are aged, eas. 
ERIN MY COUNTRY." 
Oh ! 
Erin my country, though strangerF, may roam 
Thy hills and thy mountains I 
once called my own 
Thy lakes and thy valleys no longer I 
see, 
But \ 
vannly as ever my heart beats for thee. 
CHORUS. 
Oh " Cushla Machree " my heart beats for thee, 
Erin ! Erin my heart beats for thee. 
Long years have passed o'er us since last time we met. 
But lived I 
a 
thousand I 
could not forget : 
The warm heart that loved me, 
The bright eyes that shone 
Like stars in the heaven of days that are gone. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! " Cushla Machree " my heart beatsjor thee, 
Erin ! 
Erin ! my heart beats for thee. 
Dear home of my youth, I 
shall ne'er see thee more, 
But memory treasures the bright days of yore : 
And my heart's latest wish the last sigh of my breut 
Shall be for thee, dear home, the land of the west. 
Oh ! " Cushla Machree " my heart beats for theer

LESBIA HATH A BEAMING EYE. 
By THOMAS M OORE. 
Lesbia hath a 
beaming eye, 
But no one knows for whom it beameth ; 
Right and left its arrows fly, 
But what they aim at no one dreameth. 
Sweeter ' tis to gaze upon 
My Nova's lid that seldom rises; 
Few it looks, but every one, 
Like unexpected li•rht, surprises. 
Oh, my Nora Creina, dear, 
My gentle, bashful Nora Creina, 
Beauty lies 
In many eyes, 
But love in yours, my Nora Creina 
Lesb'a wears a 
robe of gold, 
But all so close the nymph bath lac'd it, 
Not a 
charm of beauty's mould 
Presumes to stay where nature plac'd it. 
Oh, my Nova's gown for me, 
That floats as wild as mountain breezes, 
Leaving every beauty tree 
To sink or swell as heaven pleases. 
Yes, my Nora Creina, dear, 
My simple, graceful Nora Creina, 
Nature's dress 
Is loveliness— 
The dress you wear, my Nora Creina. 
Lesbia had a 
wit refined, 
But when its points ar • gleaming round us, 
Who can tell if they're designA 
To dazzle merely, or to wound us? 
Pillowed on my Nova's heart 
In safer slutob,T Love reposes— 
Bed of peace ! whose roughest part 
Is but the crumpling of the roses. 
Oh, my Nora Craina, dear, 
My mild, my artless Nora Creina, 
Wit, tho' bright. 
Hath no such light 
A warms your eyes, my Nora Creina. 
SWEET KATE O'SHANE. 
There's a 
lass of beauty rare, 
"With blue eyes and golden hair, 
One who mee's me often in the shady lane; 
And she l 
,ves me well, I 
know, 
Though she n-ver told n 
e 
so, 
And I 
know I 
dearly love sweet Kate 0"Shane. 
There's a 
charm about the girl, 
More than dainty eve or curl, 
More than all that lover's fancies may beguile; 
Ms a 
good and loving heart, 
That from me will never part: 
I 
can read it in her happy, truthful smile. 
CHORUS 
There's a

Come then sunshine, or come storm,

Come then sadness, or come 
There's a

Those blue eyes ma‘ gently fade, 
As we go down earth's fair glade, 
And the soft hair lose its tint of brightest gold, 
Yet along life's varied strand, 
As we wander hand in hand, 
We shall never, never let our hearts grow old.

PADDY Mc CARTHY THE IRISH TINKER. 
Written by John 0' Brien Egan for Dan Bryant. 
.Reopectfully dedicated to Hon. Timothy McCarthy of San Francisco, 
by his friend Dan Bryant. 
In Ballinahack there resides an ould man. 
That can handle a 
chanter a 
spade or a 
pan, 
For his tinkering trade he's a 
beautiful plan, 
And his name is ould Paddy McCarthy. 
He rises at seven his work to begin, 
And he wallops away wid his sodder an tin, 
The girls wid their tay pots and kitties come in 
To be mended by Paddy McCarthy. 
On Fridays he goes to the market at Clare, 
Wid fresh lard on his brogues, and the same on his 
hair. 
He gets drunk and throws his hat in the air, 
Who wants to fight says old Paddy Mc earthy. 
One Shaun 0' Meaney a 
piper by trade, 
Who can chanter a 
stick or a 
spade, 
Swore a 
divil a 
tinker ever was made 
Could wra,stle ould Paddy McCarthy. 
One Dennis Gilloughly, a 
comical card, 
Wid a 
noddle as bald as a 
bladder of lard, 
Got jealous of Paddy from the way that he spar'd, 
So he challenged ould Paddy McCarthy 
They fought for two hours, but he murdered poor Mac, 
Wid a 
left handed stkelp on the broad of his back. 
Paddy lay on the hoot' like a 
coal porter's sack, 
God be good to ould Paddy McCarthy. 
Poor Paddy is dead, now the solderin' rogue, 
Tho' that left banded skelp from Gilloughlys kithogue 
Every boy in the village will la:: t 
bugrougue, 
Wid sorrow for Paddy McCarthy. 
His silent remains was stuck under the clay, 
Wid his budget and soddar in glory he lay, 
I 
hope for the corpse every Christian will ;way, 
When they read of ould Paddy McCarthy.

TEDDY O'NEAL. 
I 
dreamt but last night, oh, bad luck to my dreaming! 
I'd die if I 
thought 't 
would come truly to pass— 
I 
dreamt, as the tears down my pillow were stealing, 
That Teddy was courting another fair lass. 
Oh. didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing! 
The thought of the grief was too deep to conceal. 
My mother cried, " Norab, child, what is your ailing?" 
But all I 
could utter was" Teddy O'Neal." 
I've been to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As wee a 
mud palace as ever was seen ; 
Although it did serve to keep poultry and pigs in 
I'm sure it was always most illegant clean. 
But now all about seems lonely and dreary; 
All sad, and all lonely, no piper, no reel, 
Not even the sun thro' the casement is cheery, 
Since I 
left that dear darling, oh, Teddy O'Neal. 
Shall I 
ever forget when the big ship was ready? 
The moment had come when my love must depart ; 
I 
cried like a 
spalpeen, " Good-bye to you, Teddy I" 
With drops on my cheek, and a 
stone at my heart. 
He said ' twas to better his fortune he's roaming, 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel, 
If he'd only come back to me, honest and loving, 
Still poor, but my own dear Teddy O'Neal.

Oh I 
sweet is the smile of the beautiful morn, 
As it peeps through the curtain of night, 
And the voice of the nightingale singing his tune, 
While the stars seem to smile with delight.

And tee sweet breath of summer is calm,

I've but one darling wish, and that is that you'd come 
And for ever be happy with me!

I'll give you a 
kiss for a

And all the fond vows that I've made you, I'll keep--
What more can I 
promise than this ? 
Does the sea have such bright and such beautiful charms 
That your heart will not leave it for me ? 
! 
why did I 
let you go out of my arms, 
Like a 
bird that was caged and is free! 
Oh! Shamus O'Brien, &c, 
Oh I 
Shamus O'Brien, I'm loving you yet, 
And my heart is still trusting and hind ; 
It was you who first took it, and can you forget, 
That love for another you'd find ? 
No! no! if you break it with sorrow and pain, 
I'll then have a 
duty to do ; 
If you'll bring it to me, I'll mend it again, 
And trust it, dear Shamus, to you.

BARNEY BE AISY. 
THE IRISH STRANGER. 
Composed by Citas, AlAcEvey, and sung by BARNEY, at the 
Original Ilibernicon. 
Arrah ! Nellie my dear, come stand by me here, 
Till I 
tip you a 
bit of my blarney, 
I'll sing you fine songs, ' bout the poker and tongs, 
And the beautiful Lakes of Killarney. 
I'll wrap my big coat,round your neck and your throat, 
For to keep the night dew from my daisy, 
Then my arm your dear waist, shall most lovingly taste, 
And you'll giggle " Now, Barney, be aisy.!' 
tell von about, my own darling Isle, 
The nate Emerald gem of the Ocean, 
About Ow kings and the bogs, the priests and the ! row., 
And other strange things of my notion; 
I'll tell of St. Ruth, of Sarsfield too, 
And all about Corporal Casey, 
For its sogers you like, whether bayonet or pike, 
And you'll giggle out " Barney be aisy." 
Then I'll spatte or a 
cot—on the hills of Arcme, 
With the ships and the sea underneath us, 
fresh air and fish, an illegant dish, 
Not a 
Lord in the land can ere bate us; 
Then we'll stand on the rocks of a 
fine Bummer's day, 
With our eldider so fat and so greasy, 
With the salmon and tr ,tit a 
jumpin obout, 
Then you'll whisper, now " Barney, be aisy." 
,461, 
Oh. pity the fate of a 
poor Irish str anger, 
That's wandered thus far from his home ; 
I 
sigh for protection from want, woe and danger, 
But know not which way to roam. 
I 
ne'er shall return to Hibernia's bowers, 
For bigotry bath trampled her sweetest of flowers, 
That gave comfort to me in my loneliest hours, 
They are gone and I'll ne'er see them more. 
With wonder I 
gazed on yen lofty building, 
As in grandeur it rose for its lord ; 
With sorrow I 
beheld my own garden soon yielding, 
Its choicest of fruits for its board ; 
But where is my father's low cottage of clay, 
Wherein I 
did spend many a 
long, happy day, 
Alas! has his lordship removed it away ? 
Yes, it has gone, and I'll ne'er see it more. 
When nature was seen on the sloe- bush and bramble, 
Sit smiling in beautiful bloom— 
O'er field without danger I 
used to ramble, 
And lavish amidst her perfume ; 
Or range thro' the woods where the gay feather'd throng, 
Did joyfully sing their loud-echoing ; 
The days, then, of summer passed sweetly along, 
Now they are gone, anl £ 11 leer see them more. 
When the sloes and the berries bung ripe on the bashes, 
I've gathered them off without hum : 
And gone to the fields where Eve shorn the green 
Preparing for winter's 
storm. 
Or I've sat by the tire 071 a 
cold winter's night, 
Along with my fliewls telling tales of delight. 
Those tales gave me pleasure, I 
could them invite, 
Now they are gone, shall I 
ne'er see them more ! 
But Erin, sad Erin. it grieves me to ponder, 
On the wrongs of thy injured Isle ; 
Thy sons, many thousands deploring to wander, 
On shores off far away in exile. 
But give me the power to cross o'er the main, 
America might yield me some shelter from pain, 
I'm only lamenting whilst here I 
remain, 
For the joys that I'll never see more. 
Farewell then, Erin, and those T 
left. weeping 
Toon her disconsolate shore : 
Farewell to the grave where my father lies steeping 
That ground I 
still dearly adore. 
Farewell to each pleasure I 
once had at home. 
Farewell, now a 
stranger in England I 
roan, 
0 
give my past joys, or give me a 
tomb; 
Yon, in pity I 
ask for no mon.

THE LADS WHO LIVE IN IRELAND: 
OR, WHERE TIIE APPLE PRAMS GROW. 
Afy name is Ned O'Manney, I 
was born in sweet Killarney; 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plough, reap or mow; 
And, if I 
met a 
pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know: 
I'm none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other shabby families, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show: 
Oh 1 
I'm of the O's and Mac's, and likewise the sturdy Whacks, 
CITORUS. 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree: 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've ninety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry, 
And each unto their name has a 
Mac or an 0; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan: 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show : 
I'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid; 
For, I 
was born in Ireland, & c. 
May Heaven still protect our hospitable Country. 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, and heard its cocks to crow 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely bay of Bantry! 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to show. 
Oh! those scenes I 
did enjoy, like a 
gay, unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, arc. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man in truth, was he; 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go: 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be:

There came to to tho beach a 
poor exile of Erin. 
The dew on his robe was heavy and ; 
'or his country he sighed wIntit at twilight repairing, 
To wander alone by the wind- beaten hill. 
But the day-star attracted his eyes's sad devotion: 
For, it rose on his own na;ive isle of the Ocean, 
Where once, in the flow of 1is youthful etc otion, 
He sang the bold Anthem of Erin go brag-,

Oh ! sad is my fate, said the heart-broken stranger, 
The wild deer and wolf to a

But I

CASTLES IT THE AIR, 
This world is all a 
bubble, wherever we way go, 
There's nothing hero but troubles, hardship, toil aud woe; 
Go where we will, do what we may, we are never free from care, 
And at the best, this world is bet a 
Castle in the Air. 
We are rocked upon the sea of life, just like a 
little boat, 
And some get wrecked upon the rocks, and never get afloat; 
But we will do the best we can, and never let despair 
Usurp the place between us, and our Castles in the Air. 
There is a 
name known o 
or the world, to Englishmen ' tis dear, 
And well may they be proudof him, their native, Bard Shake-
speare; 
When first his plays came cn the stage, he made the world stare 
And yet they were composed, while building Castles in the Air. 
If you take the works of Shakespeare, and study them well 
through, 
You 11 find his sayings are so wise, each soutimerit so true ; 
They'll make you feel while reading them, as i 
fyon had been there, 
And yet they were composed while building Castles in the Air. 
ut yet there is another name, to Scotchmen dearer still, 
And though a 
real true Scottish heart, ' twill make the blood to 
thrill, 
And though this world to him had been, a 
world full of' care; 
Yet Burns was always happy, building Castles in the Air. 
liis home a 
lowly Ploug,hman's Cot, yet strife there Infer was seen, 
So happy and contented had he lived wee his Jean; 
'Beside the bank 0' Bonny Boon, near to the town O'Ayr, 
The immortal Bobby Burns, built bright Castles in the Air. 
The Irish had their poet too, they loved him well I'm sure. 
He was a 
true born Irishman, We name wa. _Lhottian Moore; 
Of this world's sorrows, we know he had 
a share, 
Yet Moore was always happy, building 
tstles in the Air. 
Ile sang the rights of Ireland, he sang against her wrongs, 
And many loving Irish hearts, wil* cherish ye 
i: his sou.-1,s ; 
He made the Irish heart rejoice, he bade them ne'er despair, 
And for Ireland in the future, Built bright Cax,tlea in the Air.

And as a

In a

Said the sergeant you are just the chap, 
And placed a

They sent me off to Ballarat, 
To fight in the Hungry Army.

Sound the bugle, blow the horn, 
Fight for glory night and morn, 
hun gry soldiers, ragged and torn, 
Just returned from the army-. 
March, boys, march, the way is on before us, 
Shout, boys, shout, and join us in the chorus, 
March. boys, march, the foe is still advancing, 
Cheer, boys, cheer, for the new and happy land. 
I 
went to drill on one fine day. 
The wind was rather strong that way. 
It fact it blew us all away, 
This glorious hungry army. 
I've got a 
medal as you see, 
The workhouse presented it to me, 
For hanging to a 
rotten tree, 
When the wind took the hungry army. 
Then sound the bugle, &c. 
They cut my hair with a 
knife and fork, 
And curled it with a 
cabbage stalk, 
And fed rue on some cabbage broth, 
To tight in the hungry army. 
They served it out in a 
large tin can, 
A teaspoonful to every man, 
I 
got so fat I 
could'a stand,

Of this glorious hungry army. 
Now kind friends I

FROM TUE TOWN OF DUBLIN. 
Words and Music by H. M ILLARD. 
I 
left me ould mother wid one little brother, 
And came to this country when scarcely a 
boy: 
And though I 
am Irish, and lived on the Parish, 
I'm first-cousin-german to Patrick Malloy, 
came in short breeches that often lacked stitches, 
Had nails in me hoes fit for horses to wear ; 
Me motheed not know me, but if you would show me, 
I'd quick know me mother and Dublin of yore. 
CHORUS 
I'm Teddy McGlynn from the town of Dublin, 
And that is the name you will find on me door. 
I've worked, and I've waited, me brains I've berated; 
I've been to the schools, and to Lanigan's Ball; 
Me father was uncle to Kathleen Mavourneen; 
So l'm proud of Inc kindred, me mother, and 
But now I'm a 
lawyer, and feel like a 
warrior; 
I'll dance you the Lancers or jig, if you call. 
I've kept me shillelah, and own I'm most crazy 
To see me ould mother and Dublin once more. 
I'm Teddy McGlynn, rito. 
And soon I'll be goin' the truth to be knowin',1 
And judge for meself of ould Ireland's woes; 
If green I 
am wearing, the Shamrock is sharing 
The love in me heart for me country's`fdpose. 
For light is DOW dawning, and Liberty's morning 
Will shed its warm ray on ould Irelands shore; 
Then Katy I'll marry, and no longer tarry 
To see me ould mother and Dublin once more, 
Then Mister McGlynn, when at home in Dublin, 
Will welcome you all at his new cabin door. 
I've found many cronies amongst the Malonys, 
And often drank whiskey wid Phelim O'Toole ; 
O'Brien and MeNielly and poor Miles O'Reilly, 
Were all of us sprung when we waked Tim Mellon' 
In the finest society. famed for sobriety, 
I'm welcomed with pride at each Fenian ball ; 
I'll soon be an Alderman, like Jimmy Flanagan, 
Who Lives on Fifth Avenue, as good as them all.

THE DEAR LITTLE SHAMROCK. 
Sung by NORA at the HinEusicoN. 
There's a 
dear lit t'e plant that grows in our Isle, 
'Twas Saint Patrick himself, sure, that set it ; 
And the sun on his Libor With pleasure did smile, 
And with dew from his eyes often wet it, 
It shines through the bog, tbro' the brake and the mireland. 
And he called it the dear little Shamrock of Ireland. 
That dear iittle plant still grows in our land. 
Fresh and fair as the daughters of Erin, 
'Whose smiles ciii be witch and whose eyes can c.-immand, 
In each climate they ever appear in, 
For they shine thro' the bog, tin -u' the brake and the mirelaud, 
Just like their own dear little shamrock of Ireland, 
That dear little plant that springs from our soil, 
When its three little leaves are extended, 
Denotes rum tile stalk we tog-etl er should toil, 
And ourselves by ourselves he 1 
efriended ; 
And still thro' the bog, and the bra , o 
and the inireland, 
From one root should bra•,ch like the Shamrock of Ireland.

I MAKE NO NOISE AT ALL. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and Composed by Mn. CfiAs. MAcEvOY, for the Original 
Ilibernicon. 
Some people think that they must make a 
noise to get through life, 
While others are more sensible, avoiding every strife: 
The wise lay low- and wait their chance, the foolish loudly bawl, 
So here's my subject when I 
dance, I 
make no noise at all. 
Dance—Then watch my motion to and fro, 
So silently aboet I 
go: 
You'll see the movement of my foot. you cannot hear it fall. 
For when I 
do my little dance, I 
make no noise at all. 
I 
think It very foolish to confide in every ft 
And tell him all your business from beginning to the end; 
You can't trust everybody, if yen do you'll surely fall. 
wise in speaking of yourself, so make no nose at all. 
CHORC8 
Now as T 
think I've said enough, then silently I'll go, 
A. d if I 
have made too much noise, of course yon ought to know ; 
I 
hope to see you here again, you're welcome when you call, 
So recommend us to your friends, but make no noise at all.

OLD IRELAND, OUR COUNTRY. 
AIni—" Wearing of the Green." 
Did Ireland, our country, shall soon her freedom gain, 
And from her weeping face shall wipe away the cruel stain, 
That England long has placed upon her once bright emerald brow, 
To strike the tyrant's shackles off—the time is coming new. 
Her homes have been torn from her, and her hearths are desolatti, 
Her sons are in a 
dungeoei, and her dangh!ers mourn their fate, 
But yet she'll rise triumphant, and smile again once more, 
And drive all foreign tyranny away from Erin's shore. 
For years the noble-hearted have mourned their country's wrongs, 
And vowed they would possess that land which to Irishmen belongs. 
They nave gone across the ocean- wave to the country of the fr e, 
Though crushed their hearts, they still are brave and true will evei 
be. 
The love of their dear island ,hotne is planted in each breast, 
And till they have it once again her patriots will not rest— 
They have waited long and suffered much, and will not stiffer more, 
But drixe all foreign tyranny away from Erin's shore. 
Then arise, unfurl your banner, and spread it to the breeze, 
Each son of Erin's isle, and all who've come across the seas! 
Strike, strike for liberty ! the . word to Irishmen so dear, 
And soon our country shall be free— the time is drawing near, 
Oh I 
Erin ! dry your weeping eyes, your sons have drawn the sword, 
Which never shal be sheathed again till freedom is the word ! 
For yet triumphant you shall rise and smile again once more, 
And drive all foreign tyranny away from Erin's shore,

THE IRISH CUPID. 
By J. G
-. MAEDER. 
The Music of this Song is pablir,bed by W 11. POND & CO., 547 
Broadway, :New York. 
Oh, Cupid is a 
native god. 
Erin is his mother, 
And Ireland is his own abode, 
lie never had another. 
In Blarney's groves the boy was bred, 
And buttermilk his pap was, 
Until with whiskey he was led, 
Which rainier a 
mishap was; 
For it made hint so warm and bold, 
That still it is no wonder 
All great and small, and young and old, 
To Irish love knocks under. 
CHORUS . 
Och, love's an Irishman's employ, 
And at it he's a 
genus, 
For Cupid is an Irish boy, 
Each Irish girl's a 
Venus. 
Love's blind and bare, I 
do declare, 
And lives upon pataties, 
Why lie is so, if you would know, 
Why faith I'll tell you gratis. 
Love made each Irish boy so bright, 
They soon found beauty's prize out. 
For which. poor urchin, out of spite 
The heathens tore his eyes out, 
And to be sure he'd never roam, 
And so deserve our loathing, 
To keep love with us always vt home, 
lie took away his clothing. 
For love's an Irishman's employ, 
And at it he's a 
genus, 
For Cupid is an Irish boy, 
Each Irish girl's a 
Venus.

SWATE CASTLE GARDEN'. 
When I 
landed at Swate Castle Garden, 
I'd just came from the say, 
In my packets I 
had not a 
farthing, 
As I 
stepped out up the Broadway; 
I 
walked up to a 
lamp-lighter, 
The mystery for to unravel. 
His hair was cut short, like a 
fighter, 
So I 
shouldered my bundle and travelled. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for the stars and the stripes, 
And the land where we never see fogs, 
If I 
hadn't come here, by the pipes, 
I'd been digging up tulf in the bogs 
Shnre the road it was dirty and sloppy, 
Until I 
came to a 
street they call Wall, 
A blackguard shouted, there goes a 
Croppy. 
Whin I 
kim to the big City Hall, 
I 
axed a 
Dutch barber the way; 
He answered me (hinder and blitzen, 
And a 
big old at Yankee stepped out, 
And made me an American citizen. 
Hurrah for the Stars, ike 
The first time I 
wint out to Chicago, 
The weather it was very warm 
The Commissioners axed me if I'd go 
And settle upon a 
nice farm. 
No, says I, I'll go back to New-York, 
Where the Politicks they are so pretty, 
Lave your Dutchmen stop here and work, 
But be jabers I'll stick to the City. 
Hurrah for the Stars, &c. 
Bad luck to that villain from Sligo, 
Shure he tould me Lis name it was Hubbs 
Re sould me a 
card for Chicago; 
Be my s , u1, 'twas an on d 
Jack of Clubs, 
But I 
musn't indul-e in reflections, 
What I've stlid isn't worthy of note, 
I'll be running for Sheriff next election, 
So step up me brave boys, and vote

THE POOR HOUSE. 
The times are getting worse and worse, 
They're going down like a

And if by chance you ask for relief, 
You're knocked about and called a

Chop and bite with all your might, 
For you'll get no inure till morning ;

WHERE THE GRASS GROWS GREEN. 
ROLLICKING IRISH BARNEY. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by CHAS. M AC EVoY. 
Sung by BARNEY Tint GUIDE with aIneEvor's Original " Hibernicon.' 
I'm the rollicking Irish Barney, 
I 
deli .lit to dance and sing, 
I'm fu 1 
of the divil and blarney, 
And all of that sort of thing. 
Just w,itch my graceful motions, 
As I 
move upon the floor, 
If my foot but took a 
notion. 
It would never stop I'm sure. 
(Dance.) 
CHORUS. 
R-o-l-l-i-c-k-i-n-g B-a- r-n-e-y, 
Am I 
not full of the blarney, 
Just watch my foot astore, 
Its motion is so sure, 
The ladies' eyes they follow mine as 1 
trip about the floor. 
••• 
I'm Denny Blake from County Clare, 
And here, at your command, 
To sing a 
song in praise of home, 
And my own native land ! 
I've sailed to foreign counteries, 
And in many climes I've been, 
But my heart is still with Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love my native country, 
And tin' richer laud's I've sew. 
Yet I 
can't forget (Mid Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat; 
His heart and hospitality, 
Has much to do with that. 
Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot call him mean; 
Sure, a 
stranger's always welcome 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &e. 
He's foolish, but not vicious, 
His faults I 
won't defend; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
his life to serve a 
friend, 
He'll give, without a 
m 
rirmur— 
So, his follies try and screen; 
For, there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
(Dance.) 
I 
love my, Soe. 
(Repeat the ladies' eyes, die.) 
I 
have traveled this country over, 
And to stop I 
don't know how, 
For I 
alway., must keep moving, 
The same as ye 
see n:c now. 
But somt.how or another, 
The p 
ople all agree 
When I 
sing raid dance it pleases them, 
And of course it pleases me. 
c. 
(C110: us anl d:mce as before.) 
'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight debility 
That many more endure. 
He's fond of fun, he's witty, 
Though his wit ' tis not too keen; 
For, there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &c. 
There's not a 
true-born Irishman, 
Wherever he may be, 
But loves the little Emerald 
That sparkles on the sea. 
May the sun of bright prosperity 
Shine peaceful and serene, 
And bring better days to Erin. 
Where the grass grows green! 
For I 
love my, S

TIM RISING OF THE MOON. 
This song, which is the production of John B. Casey, " the 
Galtee Boy," who was an inmate of an English dungeon, is 
immensely popular here, especially in the West, where it is 
often made the marching tune of 
bodies of men eager to 
emulate the patriot example of the men of '08. 
it is sung to 
the Air of: " Wearing of the Green ;" 
Oh ! then, tell me, Shane 0' Farrel, tell mewhere you htirry so ? 
Hush, ma bouchal I 
hush and listen, and his cheeks were all 
aglow, 
I 
bear orders from the Captain : get you ready quick and soon 
For the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon. 
CHORUS. 
By the rising of the Moon, by the rising of the moon 
For the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon, 
I 
bear orders from the Captain : o-et you ready quick and soon, 
For, the pikes must be together by the risin' of toe Moon. 
Oh ! then, tell me, Shane 0' Farrell, where the gatherin' is to be ? 
In the ould spot, by the river, right well-known to you and me. 
One word more: for signal-token, whistle tip the marehin' tune, 
With your pike upon your shoulder, by the risin' of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, & e. 
Out from many a mud- wall cabin, eyes were watching thro' 
the night, 
Many a manly heart was throbbing for that blessed warning-
light ; 
Murmurs passed along the valley, like the banshee's lonely 
croon, 
And a 
thousand pikes were flashing by the risine, of the Moon 
By the rising of the Moon, & c. 
Down along von sing,ing river, that dark mass of men was seen, 
High above their shining weapons floats their own beloved green, 
Death to every foe and traitor ! forward ! strike the mardlin' 
tune ! 
And hurrah, my boys, for Freedom! ' tis the rising of the Moon. 
'Tis the rising of the Moon, &c. 
Well they fought for poor Ould Ireland, and full bitter was 
their fate ; 
Oh! what glorious pride and sorrow fill the name of Ninety-
Eioth t ! 
But yet, thank God, there's beating hearts in manhood's burn-
in e--noon, 
Who will follow in their footsteps by the rising of the Moon.

CARRY YOUR FRIEND IN YOUR POCKET. 
I 
don't say it's right, but there's a 
saying quite true, 
if you've goodness at least ' twill shock it. 
Its that selfish expression " Mind number one, 
And carry your friend in your pocket." 
'Tis a 
palpable fact, and requiring great tact, 
Grim poverty's inroad to block it ; 
For friendship's all fudge, and that you may judge, 
If you hav'nt a 
rap in your pocket. 
Whilst you're young an11 in health, by industry gain wealth. 
Your cutler you'll very soon stock it ; 
After that you can go and be scraped and bowed to, 
As they know you've a 
friend in your pocket. 
-When ' tis known yon have cash, why the veriest trash 
You utter, goes off like a 
rocket ; 
You re a brick' tho' a 
stick, and are flatter'd till sick, 
Thro' the friend that you've got in your pocket, 
But be poor and in want, and just ask for a 
loan. 
The need you set f 
wth they oft meek it, 
And say, Fin so short,' or ' really I 
can't,' 
Or, ' I 
havn't as much in my pocket.' 
They say ' tis no sin, to be wanting in tin, 
The nerve of those needy, ' twill shock it, 
So wher'er yon may roam, abroad or at home, 
Put our only true friend in your pocket. 
THE BIRTH OF SAINT PATRICK. 
On the eighth day of March it was, some people say 
That St. Patrick at midnKt he first saw the day ; 
While others declare ' twas the ninth he was born, 
And ' twas all a 
mistake between midnight and morn, 
For mistakes will occur in a 
burry and shock, 
And sonic blamed the baby—and sonic blamed the clook— 
'Till with all their cross questions sure no one could know 
II the child was too fast—or the clock was too slow. 
Now the first faction fight in owld 'Ireland, they say, 
Was all on account of St. Patrick's birth- day; 
Some fought for the eighth— for the ninth more would'dte, 
And who wouldn't see right, sure they blacken'd his eye! 
At last both the factions as positive grew, 
That kept each a 
birth-day—so Pat then had two, 
'Till Father Mulcahy, who showed them their sins. 
Said no one could have two birthdays but a 
pair of twills.' 
Says he, 
boys. don't he fielding for eight or for nine, 
Don't be always dividing— but sometimes combine : 
Combine eir,l,t with inn e, and seventeen is the mark, 
So let that be his birthday," Amen,' says the clerk. 
If he wasn't a 
twin. sure our hisCry will show— 
That at last e 
lie is worth two saints that we know !' 
Then th y 
all got blind drunk—which complwted their bliss, 
And we kept up the practice from that day to this.

As sung by BARNEY THE GUIDE, with CHAS. 21AcEYOY's Original 
" 
iliberuicuu." 
My name is Barney the driver lad, a 
jolly chap am I, 
I 
always am contented, be the weather wet or dry ; 
I 
snap my fingers at the snow, and whistle at the rain, 
I've braved the storm for many a 
year, and can do so again. 
C1101ZUS. 
Crack. Crack ! goes my vhip, I 
whistle and I 
sing, 
I. sit upon my jaunting-ear, Fin as happy as a 
king; 
My horse is always willing, as for me I'm never sad, 
No.te can lead a 
jollier life than Barney the Driver Lad. 
My father was a 
carrier, many years ere I 
was born, 
He used tc rise at day-break, and go his rounds each morn; 
And then he'd take me with him. especially in the Spring, 
I'd love to sit upon the car and hear my father sing. 
Crack, Crack, 8:e. 
; 
I 
never think of politics or anything so great, [
state 
I 
hate to hear their fly-blown talk about the church and 
1 
act upright to all men, and that's what makes me glad, 
"You'll find there beats an honest heart in Barney the 
Driver Lad. 
ICrack, Crack. .gze. 
1 
think I 
will conclude my song, ' tis time I 
was away. 
My horses will get weary, if I 
much longer stay; 
To see your smiling faces, it makes my heart feel glad, 
So, drivers, treat your horses kind, like Barney the Driver 
Lad.

PADDY BLAKE'S ECHO. 
Sung by BARNEY THE G UIDF,. 
In the gap of Punic, 
There's an echo or so, 
And some of the echos is very surprisin', 
You'll think in the stave 
That I 
inane to desave. 
For ballad's a 
thing you expect to find lies in, 
But sartin and thrue 
In that hill forninst you, 
There's an echo as sure and as safe as the bank too, 
(1)

PADDY BLAKE'S ECHO.—[coNOLuDED. 
If you eivil3r spake 
how d'ye do, Paddy Blake, 
The echo politely says very well, thank you. 
One day Teddy Keogh, 
With Kate Connor did go, 
r1!0 hear from the echo this wanderfttl talk, sir, 
But the echo they say 
Was conthrairy that day, [sir, 
Or, perhaps, Paddy Blake had gone out for a 
walk, 
Now, says Teddy to Kate 
'Tis too hard to be bate 
By this deaf and dumb baste of an echo so lazy, 
But if we both shout 
To each other no doubt 
We'll make up an echo between us, my daisy. 
Now Kitty, says Teddy, 
To answer be ready, 
Oh, very well thank you, cries out Kitty then, sir, 
Would you like to be wed 
Kitty darling, says Ted, 
Oh, very well thank you, says Kitty again, sir. 
Do you like me, says Teddy, 
And Kitty quite ready, 
Cried, very well thank you, with laughter beguiling, 
I 
think you'll confess 
Teddy could not do less, 
Than pay his respects to the lips that were smiling. 
Oh, dear Paddy Blake 
May you never forsake 
Those hills that return us such echoes endearing; 
And may girls all translate 
Their answer like Kate, 
No faithfulness doubtin', no treachery fearing, 
And boys be you ready 
Like frolicsome Teddy, 
But earnest in loving, though given to joking, 
And thus when inclined 
May all true lovers find 
Sweet echoes to answer from hearts they're invoking

Mueze BY T. L. Mottoy. 
(The music of this piece, arranged for the voice and the pianoforte, 
published in Da Witt' Sixpenny Series. of Choice Music. For sale by 
it. M. Do Witt, 13 Frankfort Street. 
Price six cents. 
Thady O'Flynn ag-in and agin, 
You said you loved me dearly, 
And sorra a 
bit I 
doubted it, 
I 
thought you loved sincerely; 
You said when we should married be, 
You'd make me quite a 
lady, 
But now I 
find you've changed your mind, 
It's ugly Norah Grady. 
At Phelim's wake I 
saw ye take 
her hand with glances tinder, 
Tho' sorra a 
bit ye fancied it— 
I 
saw ye through the winder; 
Your arm you placed around her waist, 
Its little she did mind ye— 
You called her ' dear' right in her ear, 
I 
wish I'd heen behind ye. 
Thady O'Flinn you vowed it thin, 
You'd make me quite a 
lady, 
But now I 
find you've changed your mind, 
It's ugly Norah Grady. 
THADY O'FLYNN—[coNciunED.] 
At Goolah fair, I 
saw ye there, 
Along with Norah Grady; 
It's sorra a 
bit ye fancied•it, 
But I 
persaiyed ye, Thady; 
I 
pity your taste your love to waste 
On Norah so consaited, 
Why I declare your'e muttherin' there— 
As if you'd been ill-trated. 
There, go your ways, yourself to plaze, 
You only need be throublin', 
Ye think there's few as fine as you 
From here away to Dublin. 
There's Pat Malone at least you'll own, 
And Mike, and Clanty Brady, 
And Barney Bourke, and Terry O'Reurk.e. 
I'm not in earnest, Thady. 
Now, Thady dear, come sit ye here, 
And listen awhile to razin, 
It's sorra a 
bit I 
mind the chit, 
Sure I 
was only tazin. 
It's you're the one to throw your fun 
At ugly Norah Grady. 
)iow don't begin and do it agin, 
Now there's a 
darlin' Thady. 
REST, DARLING, REST. 
Beside the streamlet in the vale, 
In dreamless sleep my Maggie lies, 
for waibli g 
voice is hushed and still, 
And closed in death her azure eyes; 
Yes, hero we oftentimes did meet, 
And sit beside the purling stream, 
But now she slumbers 'neath tny feet, 
And vanished is my happy dream. 
CHORUS. 
Best darling, rest, sleep dear one. sleep, 
From care and sorrow thou art free, 
Though at thy grave, I 
grieve and weep, 
'17,s sweet to know there's rest for thee. 
With broken heart I 
stand alone, 
And list to nature's Plaintive strain, 
And in each sad and plaintive tone, 
I 
seem to hear her voice again ; 
Though I 
be spared till old and gray, 
My Maggie I 
shall not forget, 
Supreme my love shall reign always, 
Until life's ruling sun shall set. 
Rest darling, &c.

I'IYI DREAMING OF THEE, NORAH. 
I'm dreaming of thee, Norah, I'm dreaming still of thee, 
Thy spirit hannts me ever, Like fairy melody; 
When in loneliness I 
wander, or in halls of mirth and glee, 
AltI my heart to thine is turning, I'm dreaming still of thee. 
I'm dreaming of thee, Norah, 
I'm dreaming still of thee. 
I'm dreaming of thee, dearest, I 
dream of thee alone, 
I 
think how well I 
love thee, and feel we shall be one; 
For I 
know there is no other, e'er can be so dear to me, 
Ah I 
when e'er I 
dream of Angels, I'm dreaming still of thee. 
I'm dreaming of thee, Norah, 
I'm dreaming still of thee. 
ERIN REAVOURNRRN. 
When the pure sense of honor shall cease to inspire thee, 
And kind hospitality leaves thy gay shore; 
When the nations that know thee, no longer admire thee— 
Then, Erin marourneen, I'll love thee no more. 
When the trumpet of fame shall cease to proclaim thee. 
Of warriors the nurse, in the ages of yore; 
When the muse, and the record of genius disclaim thee, 
Then, Erin mayourneen, I'll love thee no more. 
When thy brave sons no longer are 0
.enerons and witty. 
And cease to be loved by the fair they adore ; 
When thy daughters no longer are virtuous and pretty 
Then Erin mayourneen, I'll love thee no mcnie.
