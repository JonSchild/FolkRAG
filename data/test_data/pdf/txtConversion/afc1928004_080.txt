JUST THE THING FOR FRANK. 
Written and Composed by J. BATC HE LD E 
R. 
Sung with immense success by A RTHUR LLOYD. 
While walking out, the other night, I 
heard a 
jolly song, 
That induced me to sit down, and try to write one right or 
wrong; 
The one I 
heard, was meant to quizz a 
respected friend I 
know, 
Who in a 
most nonchalant style, Sings, " No, no, Not for 
Joe." 
Spoken.—A capital song too, and the incomparable style in. 
which my friend Baxter expresses his negatives in such a 
posi-
tive manner, has induced me to reply in the following a ma-
tive Chorus: 
CHORUS. 
A 
pretty little wife, as a 
partner for life, 
And a 
thousand or two in the Bank: 
With a 
good friend too who is honest and true, 
That's just the thing for Frank. 
The fellows wondered how it was that I 
got on so well, 
The many hearts I 
caused to break, 'tis impossible to tell; 
To enumerate my lady loves would gain for me a 
thank. 
And ' twould be breach of confidence, and not the thing for 
Frank. 
Spoken.—Decidedly not, any fellow guilty of such an in-
discretion, would never be worthy of— 
A 
pretty, etc. 
When I 
was single, 'pen my word, my friends did all de-
clare, 
That, at making love to pretty girls, Frank Fair-face was 
" 
all there." 
To stately dames I've whispered low, till in my arms they've 
sank, 
An interesting picture, eh ? and just the thing for Frank. 
JUST TILE THING FOR FRANK.—[CONCLUDED:j 
Spoken.—Decidedly interesting pro tern, but nothing to the 
olelights experienced with, 
A pretty, etc. 
But now I'm married and done for, I'll propose a 
toast for 
all, 
And although an old one, still I 
know you'll answer at my 
call: 
May the single, all get married, and the married, happy 
be” 
And then, with right good will, you'll all, this chorus sing 
with me. 
A 
happy, etc. 
'Of worldly goods I 
have my share, and am jolly as can be, 
For I'm a 
friend to any man, who friendly acts to me. 
'So in the lottery of this life, may 'You never draw a 
blank, 
But to see you all as gay as myself, is just the thing for 
Frank. 
Spoken.—Just the very thing for Frank, for what can be 
=ore pleasant, than to see those around you happy, especially 
when you have the gratification of knowing that in some 
slight degree you have contributed towards that happiness. 
'I hope some day to be personally acquainted with every one 
of you; I 
hope some day I 
shall receive an in-itation to .visit 
every one of you, and I 
trust that when I 
do have that pleas-
rare, that every one of you will be possessed of— 
A happy, etc.

JESSIE, THE BELLE AT THE BAR-
'Twits at a 
rail road station, in pursuit of my vocaticn, 
I 
saw a 
tall and handsome girl, who stood behind the bar. 
I 
heard some one call her JCS6i'., perhaps, ' twas Mr. Bond, the Icasecri, 
And her diamond eyes were twinkling, just like the evening star. 
I 
found this pretty dame made love to all that came, 
In a 
quiet sort of way, with her eyes so soft and bright. 
She had lovers half a 
score, always some one to adore, 
From the first train in the morning, till the last train out at night 
SrosEN.—Yes, her admirers were, 
CIIOEUS. 
A tinker and a 
tailor, and a 
soldier and a 
sailor. 
And a swell who used to talk about his pa and his ma, 
A butcher and a 
baker, and a 
quiet looking quaker, 
All courted pretty Jessie at the rail-road bar, 
Now 
this darling little creature, with a 
smile on every feature, 
Was serving all the customers with cakes and bitter beer, 
And this was on a 
Monday; so, r 
asked her if on Sunday 
She would meet me at the Bark gate, when she gave me such a 
leer,. 
And then she said ,to me, " most happy I 
should be, 
But I'm sorry to inform you that it's not my Sunday out; - 
One Sunday out of nine is the only day that's mine;" 
And then she had to leave me just to serve a 
glass of stout. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, but she never informed me that sbc had on previous 
Sundays walked out with— 
A tinker, etc. 
Well, better late than never, and I 
thought that I 
was clever, 
To get Jessie dear to meet me, when it was her t-hin:ay out, 
With my hair curled and anointed, at the time and place appointed, 
I 
was there to the minute, and began to look about— 
And when my Jessie came, my heart was in a 
flame, 
When I 
saw her water- fall and her bonnet trimmed so gay. 
She politely took my arm, I 
admired her every charm— 
But judge of my surprise, when I 
beard some urchins say. 
SPOKEN.—I say, Bill, if there ain't Jessie,_ along with another swell I, 
why, I've seen her with— 
• 
A tinker, etc. 
Now my confidence was shaken, but I 
thought the boys mistaken, 
And my modesty would not permit to ask if it was true. 
I-proposed, and she accepted, in a 
manner unaffected, 
And the tears she shed completely bid from me her eyes so blue. 
Then I 
sent her a 
wedding dress, lit for an Empress. 
And saw the porter give it her, while serving at the bar, 
But on our wedding•day, liss Jessie ran away 
And got married to a 
man who sold the H ERALD and the STAR! 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and the only consolation I 
had was, she had taken Ins 
besides myself, 
A tinker, etc.

UHEY TOLD VIE NOT TO LOVE HIM. 
They told me not to love him, 
They said that he would prove 
:Unworthy of so rich a 
gem 
As woman's .priceless love. 
But I 
bAieved them not, oh! no, 
I 
knew it could not be, 
That one so false as they thought Um 
Could be so dear to me. 
They told me not to love him, 
They said he was not true, 
And bade me have a 
care, lest I 
Should do what I 
might rue; 
At first I scorned their warning—for 
I 
could not think thathe 
Concealed beneath so fair a 
brow 
A heart of perfidy. 
But they forced me to discard him! 
Yet I 
could not cease to love, 
For our mutual vows recorded were 
By angel hands above. 
Ile left his boyhood's home, and sought 
Forgetfulness afar; 
'But memory stung him—and he fought, 
And fell in glorious war. 
They told me to discard him, 
They said he meant me ill, 
'They darkly spoke of friends that hire, 
And smile, and kiss, and—kill. 
I 
all unheeding heard them—for 
I 
knew it could not be, 
'That one so false as they thought him 
Could be so dear to me. 
Tie dwells in Heaven, now, while I 
Am doomed to this dull earth: 
Oh! how my sad soul longs to break 
Away, and wander forth. 
From star to star its course would. 
be, 
Unresting it would go, 
*Till we united were above, 
, Who severed were below.

BOWLD SOJER BOY: 
Oh, there's not a 
trade that's going, worth showing or knowint,r-
,, 
Like that from glory growing, for a 
Bowld. Sojer Boy; 
Where right or left we go, sure you know, friend or foe, 
Will have the hand or toe from the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
There's not a 
town we march thro', but ladies looking arch 
thro', 
The window panes will search thro', the ranks to find their: 
joy. 
While up the street, each girl you meet with look so sly, will 
cry My eye, 
Oh, isn't he a 
darling the Bowld Sojer Boy 
But when we get the rout, how they pout and they shout,. 
While to the right about goes the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
'Tis then the ladies fair, in despair, tear their hair, 
But the devil a 
one I 
care, says the Bowld Sojer Boy, 
For the world is all before us, where the landladies adore us? 
And ne'er refuse to score us, but chalk us up with joy. 
We taste her tap, we tear her cap, Oh, that's the chap for mei, 
says she, 
' 
Oh, isn't he a 
darling, the Bowld Sojer Boy? 
Then come along with me, Gramaeliree, and you'll see, 
How happy you will be with 3 
our Bowld Sojer Boy. 
Faith if you're up to fun, with me run, 'twill be done 
In the snapping of a 
gun, says the Bowld. Sojer Boy. 
And 'tis then that without scandal, myself would proudly 
dandle, 
The little farthing candle, of our mutual love and joy. 
May his light shine as bright as mine„till in the line he'Di 
blaze, and raise 
The glory of his corps, like a 
Bowld Sojer Boy, 
'THE DUTCHMAN'S SLATE. 
Ain—" Enoch Arden." 
Kind friends, you was listen, I 
told you one story 
What happened to me, here, one day. 
I 
keep of this city a 
lager-bier saloon, 
And I 
think of that business will pay. 
But my lager run out, and my Switzer-Kase, too, 
And I 
found out, when it has been too late, 
Of you want to make money in this kind of business, 
By dam! you must not keep a 
slate. 
friend, Gasper Huntz, he called on me one day, 
And asked me for em n 
glass of bier: 
He drink that, and said: It was bully! anudder, 
And then rubs his belly—right here. 
He called for more lager, and Switzer-Kase, too; 
And then he said: That was first rate! 
When I 
ask him for pay, he do so—mit his eye, 
And told me : Put that on the slate. 
Now, I 
don't like that business: and so I 
was told. him, 
One day, when lie came mit my store, 
And there I 
saw Gasper a- drinking mine lager, 
And huggin' my wife mit the door: 
I 
t 
tke him shust so, mit the slack of his breeches, 
And pitch him right out on his head: 
I 
take down that slate, and I 
break up that business, 
And den, ten tausend II was mad.

ELLA REE: 
Oh, Ella lice, so kind and true, 
In the little churchyard. lies, 
Her grave is bright with drops of dew 
But brighter were her eyes. 
Then carry me back to Tennessee,1 
There let me live and die-, 
(
Repeat..) 
Among the fields of yellow corn, 
And the land where Ella lie. 
Her pretty eyes and gentle form, 
Methinks I 
yet can see, 
I 
love the spot where she was born, 
Way down in Tennessee, 
Then carry me back to Tennessee, ) 
There let me live and die,, 
Among the fields of yellow corn,

And the land where Ella lie. 
j 
The summer moon will rise and set, 
And the night-birds trill their lay, 
And the possum and coon so softly step, 
Round the grave of Eda Ree. 
Then carry me back to Tennessee, 
There lot me live and die, 
Among the fields of yellow corn, 
And the land where Ella lie. 
THE MINSTREL BOY., 
(Repeat.),
 , 
The minstrel boy to the war is gone, 
In the ranks of death you'll find him' ; 
His father's sword he's girded on, 
And the wild harp strung behind him, 
Land of song— said the warrior bard, 
Though all the world betray thee, 
One sword at least its right shall guard, 
One faithful harp shall praise thee. 
The minstrel fell, but the foeman's chains-
Could not keep his proud soul under ; 
The harp he loved ne'er spoke again, 
He tore the strings asunder ; 
And said : " no chains shall sully thee, 
Thou soul of love and. bravery, 
Thy songs were made for the pure and free 
They shall never sound in slavery l" 
RORY 0' MORE. 
*Young Rory O'Moro courted Kathleen Bawn, 
Ile was bold as the hawk, she as soft as the fawn, 
He wished. in his heart pretty Kathleen to please, 
And he thought the best way to do that, was to tease. 
" 
Now, Rory, be aisy,' . sweet Kathleen would cry, 
Reproof on her lip but a 
smile in her eye; 
" 
With your tricks I 
don't know, in troth, what I'm about, 
,1 Faith you've teased ti 1 
I've put on my cloak inside out." 
Oh, jewel," says Rory, 
that same is The way 
You've treated my heart this many a 
day, 
And ' tis pleased that I 
am , and why not, to be sure ? 
For 'tis all for good luck," says hold Rory O'More. 
" 
Indeed, then,' says Kathleen, " don't think of the like, 
For I 
half gave a 
promise to soothering Mike ; 
The ground that I 
walk on he loves Pll be bound," 
" 
Faith," says Rory, " Ill rather love you thau the ground." 
"Now, Rory, I'll cry if you don't let inc go, 
.Sure I 
dream every night that I'm hating you so!" 
Says Rory, " That same I'm delighted to hear, 
For dreams always go by contraries, my dear ; 
Oh I 
jewel ! keep dreaming that same till you die, 
And bright morning will give dirty night the bick lie; 
And ' tis pleased. that I 
am, and why net, to be sure? 
Since ' tis all for good luck,' says bold Rory O'More. 
" 
Oh Kathleen, my darling, you've teased me ertomtli, 
I've thrashed for your sake, ainny Grimes and Jim Duff, 
And I've made myself drinking your health quite a 
beast, 
So I 
think after that I 
may talk to the priest I" , 
Then Rory, the r ) gtic;, stole his hand round her neck, 
So soft and so white, without freckle or speck, 
And he looked in her eyes that were beaming with light. 
And kiss'd her sweet lips, dont you think he was tight ? 
"Now, Rory. leave off, sir, you'll hug me no more, 
That's eight times times to-day that you've kiss'd me before." 
Then here goes another," says he, • to make sure, 
For there's luck in odd numbers." says Rory 0'11ore.

JAY LOVE NELL. 
Ant—" Come all 
Oh! come all, you boys, both far and near. 
And listen a 
while to me: 
And a 
dismal story you will hear 
About my love and me. 
I 
coorted long.. my love was sthrong 
As the heart of a 
big oak three; 
But sorry I'm to say 
My love is gone away 
To the shores av Amer-i-kay. 
CHORUS. 
For, my love Nell 
Was a 
charmin' girl: 
From the cove av Cork kern sho:, 
But I 
weeped and I 
railed 
Whin the big ship sailed 
For the shores av America.. 
Whin I 
got to the church, 
I 
was left in the lurch.. 
But let that day go by; 
Whin I 
got to the door, 
Nelly sez; I'm poor! 
Then, my love, sez I, good-bye I 
For, I 
know right well 
You're an Irish girl; 
So, you don't come over me. 
Oh I 
sez Nclly, d'ye mind, 
1'11 lave you far behind,

Is worth twinty thousand million on a

Though persuade you they may for to name the day, 
Then say, Wait till the time suits me. 
Then as slippery as an eel, they'll turn on their heel, 
And sail for America.

LET THE DEAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL REST. 
Words by C. C. BUTLER. 
Music by S. W ESLEY M ARTI N. 
Let the dead and the beautiful rest, 
Make her grave 'neath the willow by the stream, 
Where the wind-harps will whisper o'er the blest, 
Like the song of some Angel in our dream. 
DUETT Oh! so young and fair, with her bright golden hair! 
Oh! so young and fair, with her bright gold,en hair! 
CHORUS. 
Let her sleep, let her sleep, 
Let her sleep 'neath the willow by the stream: 
Let her sleep, let her sleep, 
Let her sleep 'neath the willow by the stream. 
Let the dead and the beautiful rest: 
For, the Spring-time is coming with its flowers, 
When the wild-rose will blossom o'er her breast, 
As the song- birds will while away the hours. 
Repeat Duett apd Chorvs. 
Let the dead and the beautiful rest, 
Where the long drooping willow branches wave; 
While the moon, slowly sinking in the West, 
Leaves the stars keeping vigils o'er her grave. 
Repeat Mutt and Chorus.

THE VELOCIPEDE.—[CONCLUDED.] 
'Twas when I 
went a 
racing 
One day upon the street, 
I 
met a 
lovely charmer— 
Our eyes they chanced to meet 
I 
touched my hat so neatly, 
My " challenge" she did heed--
She sailed—I 
followed after, 
On my gay velocipede 1 
Whiz 1 
Bang! Fiz! Clang! &o. 
Away we flew together— 
The folks they stopped and stared-
Policemen holloed after, 
But not a 
thing we cared. 
Her lovely curls were dancing, 
And faster went her steed 
I 
lost my hat and coat tails 
On my gay velocipede 
Whiz! Bang! Fiz! Clang! &c. 
I 
tried to " rein " my " racer," 
But faster went instead ; 
Another mile we blustered, 
Which found us both " ahead 
A peanut stand before us, 
We neither one could heed— 
We struck it, 0, and busted up 
Our gay velocipede! 
Whiz I 
Bang I 
Fiz 1 
Clang 1 &c. 
But there came a 
fellow, 
A stylish sort of chap, 
He winked at my dulcinea; 
To me a 
dire mishap; 
They dashed away together— 
He calmly smoked his weed— 
And left me toddling after, 
On my gay velocipede I

SUSAN'S SUNDAY OUT. 
Oh sha'n't I 
be delight-ed just when Sunday comes, I 
know ; 
I 
wish it would make haste and come, but ' tis so pre-cious 
slow. 
No doubt, you will de-sire to know what it's really all about ? 
The fact is that • Next Sunday is my Susan's Sunday out. 
CHORUS. 
Oh Ge-mi-ni, en-key, blow me tight, I 
always dance and shout. 
It fills my heart with great delight, when it's Susan's Sunday out; 
Repeat. ) 
My Susan is a 
kitchen-maid, and lives in Washington-Square; 
She's eyes like sloes, a 
turn- up nose, and a 
carroty head of hair; 
She's often taken for a 
Queen, as with me she walks about, 
And I 
always feel so happy when it's Susan's Sunday out. 
Oh ! Gemini, crikey, &c. 
She must have lots of perquisites: for, she brings me lots of 
meat, • 
Tho' sometimes in the summer time they isn't over sweet; 
She keeps me well in Pannum; that's what makes me look so 
stout— 
And don't I 
just blow out my kite on Susan's Sunday out. 
Oh! Gmini, crikey, &c. 
And all the loose tobacco she finds in the empty jars, 
She gives to me and sorn4times brin s 
a 
bundle of cigars; 
She says they're all her perquisites . which, of course, I.do not 
doubt, 
And sometimes wish that oftener 't 
was Susan's Sunday out. 
Oh t 
Gemini, crikey, & c. 
Her perquisites extends to clothes • for, she brings me bang up 
suits— 
Coats, Trowsers, Shirts, and Waistcoats, -Umbrellas, Hats and 
Boots. 
Says she: Master he can't wear em now, acos he's got so stout: 
So he gave em to me to give to you, when '
twas my Sunday out. 
Oh! Gemini, crikey, &c. 
Tier mistress and the young ones are often out of town: 
Tnen I 
goes into the kitchen and to tea with her I 
sit down— 
Her twister he can't come down stairs, he's always got the ( rout: 
And sometimes two or three times a 
week, it's Susan's Sunday 
out. 
Oh! Gemini, crikey, &c. 
We've got an eye to business and are already beginning 
To stock a 
pretty little shop with lots of Baby- Linen. 
She says: It may be wanted—and it will, I 
have no doubt; 
For married we intend to be on Susan's Sunday out. 
Oh Gemini, crikey, &c. 
TRUST TO LUCK. 
Trust to luck, trust to luck, stare fate in the face, 
Sure the heart must be aisy when it's in the right 
place, 
Let the world wag awry, let your friends turn to foes, 
Let your pockets run dry, and threadbare your clothes. 
Should woman deceive when :you trust to her heart, 
Never sigh, 'twont relieve it, but add. to the smart. 
CHORUS. 
Trust to luck, trust to luck, stare fate in the face, 
Sure the heart must be aisy when it's in the right place; 
Trust to luck, trust to luck, stare fate in the face, 
Sure the heart must be aisy when its in the right place. 
Be a 
man, be a 
man, wheresoever you go, 
Through the sunshine of wealth, or the tear drop of woe; 
Should the wealthy look grand and the proud pass you by, 
With the back of their hand, and scorn in their eye, 
Snap your fingers and smile as they pass on their way, 
And remember the while every dog has his day. 
Trust to luck, &c. 
In love or in war, sure it's Irish delight, 
He's good humored with both, the sweet girl and a 
fight. 
He coaxes, be bothers, he blarneys the dear, 
To resist him she can't, and she's off when he's near, 
And when valor calls him from his darling he'd fly, 
And for liberty fight, for Ould Ireland he'd die. 
Trust to luck, &c.

THE RED ROBIN. 
Come into my cabin, Red Robin, 
Thrice welcome, blithe warbler to me, 
Now winter has got its white cap on, 
And again thou comest trembling to me, 
Come, freely hop into my pantry, 
And partake of my plain humble fare; 
I 
never was blest with a 
dainty, 
But what man and bird might share. 
Three years have gone by, Red Robin, 
Since first thou earnest trembling to me ; 
Alas how things have altered, sweet warbler, 
Since Mary proved false unto me ! 
I 
once had my wee bonny lassie, 
But away with another she is gone; 
Her friends used to visit my cabin, 
But alas ! now I 
sigh all alone. 
Sweet is thy wild notes, Red Robin; 
They bring many a 
tear to my eye; 
It calls to my mind youthful pleasures, 
When Mary sung sweetly to me. 
Though pleasures gives way to sorrow, 
And pleasure gives millions to pain, 
Frail hope can ne'er delight a 
fond lover: 
Life's comfort I 
sigh for in vain. 
Then where is thy sweet-heart, Red Robin ? 
Go fetch her from the house-top or tree, 
I'll bid her to be kind to thee, Robin, 
Though false was my las,ie to me. 
Thou shall share every crumb on my table, 
And sing the cold winter away; 
I 
would never deceive thee, sweet birdy. 
Let mortals use me as they may. 
NO ONE TO LOVE. 
No one to love, none to caress, 
R )aming alone through this world's wilderness; 
Sad is my heart, joy is unknown; 
For, in my sorrow, I'm weeping alone, 
No gentle voice, no tender smile 
Makes me rejoice, or cares beguile. 
CIIORIIS. 
No one to love, none to caress, 
Roaming alone through this wor'd's wilderness, 
Sad is my heart, joy is unknown; 
For, in my sorrow, I'm weeping alone. 
In dreams alone, loved ones I 
see, 
And well-known voices then whisper to me: 
Sighing I 
wake, -waking I 
weep; 
Soon with the loved and the lost I 
shall sleep, 
Oh! blissful rest ! what heart would stay 
Unloved, unbless'd, from Heaven away. 
No one to love, &o. 
No one to love, none to caress, 
None to respond to this heart's tenderness, 
Trusting I 
wait; God, in his love, 
Promises rest in his mansions above, 
Oh I 
bliss in store! oh I 
joy mine own l 
There never more to weep alone. 
No one to love, Sze.

While being out on this spree, 
With my new white hat and evening dress,

A policeman came up at the time, 
The noise to ascertain, then,

But his efforts were in vain, then ;

WRITE TYIE A SONG OF MY FATHER.

pray, 
You ever write songs about Mother,,

Is his love and. affection less ardent ? 
Does his heart less emotion bestow ? 
Though the sun to the moon is less ardent, 
Still but one light from both o'er us glow..

Oh! write me song of my Father, 
And tell me the reason, I

Not a

Oh! think of him, when in your childhood, 
With dear Molter, he'd fervently pray, 
And call you his child and his darling, 
And that God might protect you alway 
Then blessings and kisses he'd give you, 
And call you his own pretty boy, 
When scarce you could lisp the word: Father! 
And your heart free from earthly alloy. 
Ohl write me a 
song. &e. 
And now that you've growi'i into manhood, 
Be grateful to him whose fond care 
Ever guarded both you and your Mother, 
And as oft dried the sorrowful tear, 
Oh! love him, think not of him lightly; 
Cheer his heart, let it not be opprest— 
Love your Mother, but don't forget Father— 
Let the one with the other be blessed!

THE SNEEZE ;

But step—er— (trying to sneeze)—no,

thought, . 
When a

And if that fly had not perched there, 
I 
think I 
should have snoze. 
Snoze! that's not wight, 
At least not quite, 
I've a 
wrong word used no doubt— 
Spoken—Let's see, how is that; sneeze, sneezing, snoze— 
no, that's not right: sneeze, it's snozing, snooze, no, I've mixed 
it up somehow ah, well, 
It's one of those, etc. 
I've come down here to tWy and stop 
The'mawage of my bwother; 
As I'm his only welative, 
Except my gwooms godmother, 
No, that's not wight, 
At least not quite, 
There's something wrong popped out. 
Spoken—What is it ? 
I 
know, my servant's father was my 
godmother's gwoom ; yes, then what weltition is my servant to 
me ? 
If my servant's godmother was my father's gwoom, I

She never blam'd him, never; 
But received him when he came, 
'With a

And she dreaded not her doom', 
She never thought of sighing, 
O'er her beauty's blighted bloom—

For she knew that they must ?art;

And she heard the bugle's sound; 
'They pass'd and strangers found her 
Cold and lifeless on the ground.

THERE'S A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW FOR 
THEE. 
When a 
boy but twelve years old, I 
worked hard to support 
my mother and two younger brothers, and usually carried my 
earnings home every evening. 
One night, it being very dark 
and muddy, and having three miles to travel and a 
heavy bun-
dle to carry, I 
did not reach home until late. 
My mother, 
feeble and weary, had retired, but she quickly aroused when 
she heard my foot-st-ps and voice, and soon met inc at the 
door, with a 
warm kiss and warmer tears, and a: " God bless 
you, my boy." As she received my bundle, she exclaimed: 
" 
After this, my son, I'll set a 
light in the window for you." 
And, true to her word, the bright light in the window ap-
ppared, and oh ! how it cheered my heart ever after for years I 
Health failing me, I 
left home, ( after my other brothers could 
help in ,Alter.) and went to sea. 
When three years from home 
and on the Pacific Ocean, my mother died; but just before she 
expired, she said to those around her: " Oh! give Edward my 
dying blessing: for, he has been a 
good boy; tell him I 
have 
gone to Heav,n, and I 
will set a 
light in the window for 
him." 
There's a 
light in the window for thee, brother, 
There's a 
light in the -window for thee: 
A dear one has moved to the mansions above: 
There's a 
light in the window for thee. 
CHORUS. 
A mansion in Heaven we see, 
And a 
light in the window for thee; 
A mansion in Heaven we see, 
And a 
light in the window for thee. 
There's a 
crown, and a 
robe, and a 
palm, brother; 
'When from toil and from care you are free, 
The Saviour has gone to prepare :Vona home, 
With a 
light in the window for thee. 
A mansion, &e: 
Oh ! watch, and be faithful, and pray, brother, 
All your journey o'er life's troubled sea ; 
Though afflictions assail you. and storms beat severe, 
There's a 
light in the window for thee. 
A mansion, &c.

Till from conflict and suffering free-,

There's a

THOU BAST LEARNED TO LOVE ANOTHER. 
Thon bast learned to love another— 
Thou bast broken every vow— 
We have parted from each other, 
And my heart is lonely now. 
I 
have taught my looks to shun thee, 
When coldly we have met, 
For another's smile hath won thee, 
And thy voice I 
must forget, 
Oh I 
is it well to sever 
This heart from thine for ever, 
Can I 
forget thee ? never! 
Farewell, farewell for ever. 
We have met in scenes of pleasure, 
We have met in halls of pride, 
I 
have, seen thy new found treasure, 
And I've gazed upon thy bride. 
Thy looks were stern and altered— 
Thy words ran cold and high, 
How my traitor courage faltered, 
When I 
dared to meet thine eye. 
Would I 
neler had met thee, 
Fain, fain, would I 
forget thee, 
'Twere folly to regret thee; 
Farewell, farewell for ever. 
We have met and and we have parted, 
Yet I 
uttered scarce a 
word, 
Like a 
guilty thing I 
started, 
When thy well known voice I 
heard. 
I 
have marked the timid lustre, 
Of thy downcast happy eye, 
I 
have seen thee gaze upon her, 
Forgetting I 
was nigh. 
Oh, woman's love may grieve her, 
And woman's pride will leave her, 
Life is fled when love deceives her, 
Farewell, farewell for ever.

PADDY CAREY. 
'Twas at the town of nate Clogit eon, 
That Sergeant Snapp met Paddy Carey; 
A chiller boy was never seen. 
Brisk as a 
bee, light as a 
fairy; 
His brawny shoulders, four feet square, 
his cheeks like thumping red potatoes, 
His legs would make a 
chairman stare! 
And Pat was loved by all the ladies, , 
Old and young, grave and sad, 
Deaf and dumb, dull or mad, 
Waddling, twaddlng, 
squinting, 
Light, brisk and airy— 
CHO 
All the sweet faces at Limerick races, 
From Nullinavelt to Magherafelt, 
At Paddy's beautiful name would melt! 
The sowls would cry, and look so shy, 
Och! Cushlamachree, did you never see 
The jolly boy, the darling joy, the ladies toy, 
Nimble-footed, black-eyed, rosy-cheeked, 
Curly-headed Paddy Carey! 
0, sweet Paddy, beautiful Paddy! 
Nate little, tight little Paddy Carey. 
His heart was made of Irish oak, 
Yet, soft as streams from sweet Killarney, 
His tongue was tipped with a 
bit of the brogue, 
But the deuce a 
bit at all of the blarney. 
Now Sergeant Snapp, so sly and keen; 
While Pat was coaxing duck-legged Mary, 
A shilling slipped, so nate and clime, 
By the powers, he 'listed Paddy Carey! 
Tight and sound—strong and light— 
Cheek so round—eyes so bright— 
Whistling, humming, drinking, drumming, 
Light, tight and airy— 
All the sweet faces, &c. 
PADDY CAREY.—[CONCLUDED.] 
The sowls wept loud, the crowd was great, 
When waddling forth came widow Leary; 
Though she was crippled in her gait, 
her brawny arms clasped Paddy Carey! 
" 
Och I 
Pat," she cried, " go buy the ring; 
here's cash, galore, my darling honey." 
Says Pat, " You sowl I'll do that thing." 
And clapped his thumb upon her money. 
Gimlet eye—sausage nose— 
Pat so sly—ogle throws— 
Learing, tittering, jeering, frittering, 
Sweet widow Leary! 
All the sweet faces, &c. 
When Pat had thus his fortune made, 
He pressed the lips of Mistress Leary, 
And. mounting straight a 
large cockade, 
In captain's boots struts Paddy Carey; 
He grateful praised her shape, her back, 
To others like a 
dromedary; 
Her eyes, that seemed their strings to crack, 
Were Cupid's darts to Captain Carey! 
Nate and sweet, no alloy— 
All complete—love and joy. 
Ranting, roaring, soft adoring, 
Dear Widow Leary! 
All the sweet faces, &c. 
From Mullinavat to Magherafelt, 
At Paddy's promotion sigh and melt; 
The sowls all cry as the groom struts by, 
Och ! Cushlamachree, thou art lost to me, 
The jolly boy! the darling boy! 
The ladies' toy, the widow's joy ! 
Long sword girted, nate short skirted, 
Head cropped, whisker-chopped Captain Carey I 
0 sweet Paddy, beautiful Paddy! 
White-feathered, beet-leathered Paddy Carey! 
AU sweet faces &c.

I AM DREAMING, SADLY DREAMING. 
Words by G EO. BIRDSEYE. 
Musieby FRED. BUCKLEY. 
I 
am dreaming, sadly dreaming 
Of the love that once was mine 
But the Past, is past redeeming, 
And in sorrow now I 
pine. 
It has left me, like the Summer, 
With each joy and blooming flower: 
And now Winter, warlike comer, 
Holds my heart within his power. 
CHORUS . 
I 
am dreaming, sadly dreaming 
Of the love that once was mine; 
But the Past is past redeeming, 
And in sorrow now I 
pine. 
I 
am dreaming, sadly dreaming of the love that 
once was mine! 
I 
am dreaming, sadly dreaming 
Of the joys that once were mine: 
Of Lov's star so brightly gleaming, 
And which now has ceased to shine. 
In the darkness now I 
wander: 
For , my happiness is o'er ; 
And I 
fondly, fondly ponder 
On the days that are no more I 
I 
am dreaming' sadly dreaming, &c. 
BLUE-EYED NELLY. 
When the bird is on the bough, 
Retiring, love, to rest: 
When the sun is gently sinking 
Down in the beauteous West: 
I 
roam then with my Nelly, 
My own my lovely bride, 
And I 
bless the hour of gladness, 
When both our hearts were tied. 
CHORUS . 
Oh ! darling Nelly, NI e'er be true to thee ; 
My sweet, my blue-eyed Nelley, thou art all the 
world to me. 
That blessed, little ehureh, 
Down yonder shady lane 
Its form is in my sight, 
Where Nelly changed her name. 
We cannot boast of riches, 
Which others may possess ; 
But peace and happiness is all 
We wish with to be blessed. 
Oh, darling, &c.

To dat pretty yaller gal dressed in blue. 
She's set dis darkey, 
THOU ART GONE FROM MY GAZE 
Thou art gone from my gaze like a 
beautiful dream, 
And I 
seek thee in vain by the meadow and stream, 
Oft I 
breathe thy dear name to the winds floating by, 
But thy sweet voice is mute to my bosom's lone sigh. 
In the stillness of night when the stars mildly shine, 
My heart fondly holds sweet communion with thine,, 
For I 
feel thou art near and where'er I 
may be, 
That the spirit of love keeps a 
watch over me.

A MOTTO FOR EVERY MAN. 
Some people you've met in your time, no doubt, 
Who never look happy or gay ; 
I'll tell you the way to get jolly and st ut. 
If you'll listen a-while to my lay. 
I've come here to tell you a 
bit of my mind, 
And please with the same if I 
can ; 
Advice, in my song, you will certainly find, 
And a 
motto for every man. 
CHORUS. 
So we will sing, and banish melancholy, 
Trouble may come, we'll do the best we can 
To drive care away : for grieving is a 
folly; 
"Put your shoulder to the wheel," is a 
Motto for every man. 
We cannot all fi2,1-it in this battle of life, 
The weak must go to the wall ; 
S. do to each other the thing that is right ; 
For, there's room in this world for us all. 
Credit refuse, if you've the money to pay; 
You'll find it the wiser plan ; 
And " A penny lay by for a 
rainy day " 
Is a 
motto for every man. 
So, we will sing, &c. 
A coward gives in at the first repulse, 
A brave man struggles again. 
With a 
resolute eye, and a 
bouuding pulse, 
To battle his way amongst men ; 
For he knots he has but one chance, in his time, 
To better himself, if he can ; 
So, " Make your hay while the sun doth shine," 
La motto for every man. 
So, we will sing, -&c. 
Economy study, but don't be mean ; 
" 
A penny may lose a 
pound ;" 
Thto' this world, a 
conscience clean 
Will carry you safe and sound. 
all very well to be free, I 
will own, 
To do a 
good turn, when you can ; 
But " Charity always commences at home," 
That's a 
motto for every man. 
So, we will sing, &o. 
STOP DAT KNOCKING, OR SUSY BROWN. 
I 
once did love a 
yaller gal, whose name was Susy Brown ; 
Sue came from Alabama, and was the fairest in the town ; 
Her eyes so bright that they shine at night, 
When the moon has gone away; 
She used to call this nic,.ra up, 
Just afore th e broke of °day, 
With a ' Who dar, who dar, who dar, who dar knocking 
at the door ?' 
Spoken—Atn dat you, Sam, no 'tis Jim. 
Why, Sam, ain't you gaine to lull' me in ? 
No ? you'd better stop dat knockin' at the door. 
'Let me in,' 
Stop dat knockin'. ' Let me in.' 
Stop dat knock in'. ' Let me in.' 
Ali l 
you better stop dat knockin' at my door.' 
Let me in.' 
' 
Stop dat knockin', stop dat knockin', stop dat knockin', 
Stop dat knockin', oh I 
you better stop dat knockin' at my 
door.' 
She was the handsomest gal dat eber I 
did see: 
She neber went out walkin' with any colored man but me; 
I 
took my banjo to the house, to play three times or more, 
When I 
heard two or three knocks pretty hard, 
Come bang ag'in the door. 
Spoken — With a Who dar, who dar,' &c. 
HOME AGAIN. 
Home again, home again, from a 
foreign shore; 
And 0, it fills my soul with joy, to meet my friends once more. 
Here I 
dropped the parting tear, to cross the ocean's foam ; 
But now I'm once again with those who kindly greet me home. 
CHORUS. 
Home again, home again, from a 
foreign shore; 
And 0, it fills my soul with joy, to meet my friends once more. 
Happy hearts, happy hearts, with mine have laughed in glee, 
But 0, the friends I 
loved in youth seem happier to me. 
And if my guide should he tire fate which bids me longer roam, 
But death alone can break the tie that binds my heart to home. 
Home again, &c. 
Music sweet. music soft, lingers round the place ; 
And 0, I 
feel the childhood charm, that time cannot efface. 
Then give me but my homestead roof, I'll ask no palace dome; 
For I 
can live a 
happy life Ivith thpse I 
love at home. 
Home again, &c.

JINNI Y RIDDLE. 
Now, I'll tell you, if I 
can, of a 
pretty girl called Nan, 
Who stole the young affections of this individual. 
I 
never knew Tv) love but t 
know it now, by Jove! 
And I 
sorrow through the treatment of a 
false young gal 
She was a 
perfect Venus : and, had nothing come at ween us, 
We might have been as happy as a 
great big turtle-dove. 
CHORUS. 
But a 
man named Jimmy Riddle,what played upon the fiddle, 
lie managed for to swindle we out of my true love. 
At a bakery, down in Grand, you will please to under-
stand, 
I 
first beheld my Nancy, who behind the counter stood, 
She looked so neat and nice, while serving out her pies 
To the many hungry customers ! 
The sight would do you 
good, 
Rither hungry I 
did feel: so, I 
thought a 
little eel 
Wou,d gain a 
smile from Nano.
.., if not beneficial prove; 
But oh! that Jimmy Riddle, &c. 
Now, I 
told my love to Nan, like an honest, good young man, 
She smiled and wiped her nose, and said that I 
was very kind, 
And if I 
would but stay L.11 her twenty-first birthday, 
She'd think the matter over aril let me know her mind. 
The fildler used to frown so, I 
thought I'd done him brown, 
To gain a 
smile from Nancy, what happiness; by Jove! 
But, oh! that Jimmy Riddle, &c. 
Now, her birthday drawing near, thinks I, I'll go and see her, 
So, in I 
goes, quite full of hop, into her little shop; 
But judge of my surprise! there was another girl servingpies, 
My head began to spin around, and I 
thought that I 
should drop. 
Thinks I; PII know the worst, my brain it almost burst; 
I 
asked for Nan; the young womAn my worst of fears did prove. 
Spoken:—Why, haven't you heard tivt news? Why, we 
have got the laugh at you; and I 
discovered that: . 
She'd married Jimmy Riddle, &c. 
Now, I 
doesn't mean to fret, though I 
never yet have met 
A 
girl half like my Nancy, so loving and so nice. 
And as to Riddle, he, if my wi 1 
should be, 
Compelled to live on nothing else but little pies : 
And if his days they were not short, they're better than I 
thought. 
So farewell I 
dining Nancy, though faithless 3-on did prove, 
Bad luck to Jimmy Thddle, I'd like to smash his fiddle: 
For, . he managed for to swindle me of my true love.

As I 
strayed from my cot at the close -of the day, 
About the beginning of June, 
'.Neatit a 
iessamine shade I 
espied a 
fair maid, 
And she sadly complained to the moon. 
Moll on, silver moon, guide the traveller's way, 
When the nightingale's song is in tune; 
But never, never more with my lover 1'11 stray, 
By thy sweet silver light, bonny moon. 
Roll on, &a. 
As the hart on the mountain my lover was brave, 
So handsome, so manly, and clever, 
So kind and sincere, and he loved me so dear, 
Oh, Edwin, thy equal was never. 
But now he is dead and gone to death's bed, 
He's cut down like a 
rose in full bloom; 
lie's fallen asleep and poor Jane's left to weep, 
By the sweet silver light of the moon. 
Roll on, &c. 
But his grave 
seek out until morning appears, 
And weep for my lover so brave, 
I'll embrace the cold turf and wash with my tears, 
The flowers that bloom o'er his grave; 
But never again shall my bosom know joy, 
With my Edwin I 
hope to be soon: 
Lovers shall weep o'er the grave where we sleep, 
By thy sweet silver light, bonny moon. 
Roll on. ;to.

Still by my side did linger one.

May Heaven protect tne for her sake: 
I 
pray, both night and day, 
That I 
ere long may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May.

Although I'm far away :

And my little Maggie May.

BE QUIET, OR I 
LL SCREAM. 
SERIO-COMIC soNa 
One bright midsummer's eve, 
With Harry by my side, 
As we went strolling forth, 
I 
fueled that be sighed. 
His arm around my waist, 
With joy his eyes did beam; 
He asked a 
kiss. 
Says I; 
Be quiet, or I'll scream I 
We reached my cottage d9or: 
He bade me there good-bye; 
My heart rebuked me then, 
I 
thought of his deep sigh: 
So, smiling at my beau, 
Who rather glmn did scow, 
Says I: Love, take a 
I 
never meant to scream. 
We tread the same old pa 
Though years I've been a 
x, 
Our days glide on in biiss. 
We k 
how no care or str:fe. 
And when we reach one spo% 
As bright the moon doi h 
beam 
He laughs, and so do I, 
'Twas there I 
said I'd scream. 
His heart is all my own, 
And his sweet k'sses, too; 
He's just as constant now 
As when he came to woo; 
The walks are just the same, 
The moon as bri;.:ht doth beam, 
Bat if he failed to kiss, 
Oh, dear! how I 
shOuld scream 1

PRETTY JEMIMA. 
My love she lives in a 
two-pair back, 
Her eyes are bri oda as stars of night : 
Of falling in love I've got a 
knack, 
And she is the girl for me. 
At six o'clock, sic leaves off work, 
At seven, she's finished. her tea, 
At eight, she's dressed in all her best, 
And she comes for a 
walk with me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! pretty Jetniina, don't say— No 
Oh 1 
hi oh! don't say—No. 
Pretty Jemima, don't say—No. 
And we will married be. 
1, once, was afraid to speak :mtright: 
I 
was so shy, I 
feared to try : 
The thought of it put me all in a 
fright 
So' I'd grizzle and pine all day. 
I 
was getting as thin as a 
scaffold-pole, 
My buttons all fell away, 
And just because I 
hadn't the nerve 
To pluck up courage and say: 
Oh I 
pretty Jemima, &c. 
We went for a 
walk, not long ago— 
Thinks I—somehow, I'll tell her now 
I 
just was going to let her know. 
When she spied a 
milliner's shop: 
A 
hat and feathers was there for sale, 
I 
couldn't do less than stop: 
By the time I 
bad bought it, my courage had gone 
And I 
couldn't the question pop. 
Oh! pretty Jemima, &C. 
At last, one morning, I 
bought the ring, 
And lilt on a 
plan to make me a 
man., 
Thinks I 
to myself: this is the thing, 
This night shall cast the die. 
I 
held it up : look ye here, I 
said, 
The moment it caught her eye, 
Her lovely cliPeks were suffused with red, 
And seeing no one was by, I 
said : 
Olt ! pretty Jemima, &c. 
Of course, I 
was anxious to know my fate 
I 
almost dread the words I 
said. 
WhethPr to be with joy elate, 
Or be the most wretched of men. 
She tried it on her finger, and said : 
'Twas a 
little too large, but then 
I 
could buy a 
keeper, and we'd get wed, 
Next Saturday morning, at ten.

Oh

NANCY FAT. 
Oh! Nancy Fat, she was a 
gal 
Fair and tall and slender, 
The fairest gal I 
ever sa w, 
In all the female gender. . 
A lovely foot I 
know she had, 
Into a 
boot to thrust; 
Her ankles small were made for use, 
To keep from it the dust. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Nancy Fat, what are you at ? 
I 
love you as no other.; 
Oh! Nancy Fat, get out of that, 
With sweetness me you'll smothe 
Ou ! Nancy Fat, she had a 
mouth, 
I 
cannot now describe it: 
It opened like a 
safety-valve, 
When she wished to divide it; 
And well I 
knows she had a 
nose, 
And ev'rybocly knows it ; 
The end of it just looks as if 
The brandy-bottle froze it. 
Oh! Nancy Fat, &c. 
! 
Nancy Fat had two such eyes, 
Like burnt holes in a 
blanket: 
The inspiration from her soul 
I 
took it in and drank it; 
She says this darkey am so sweet, 
She loves me like molasses; 
Dat small machine she calls her heart, 
Goes pit- pat as it passes. 
Oh! Narcy Fat, &c. 
If Nancy Fat does marry me, 
How nice we'll live together, 
She and I 
and all de bairns, 
Like ducks in rainy weather! 
And as we march unto the church, 
And hear the bells a 
ring-in', 
De joy will break di s 
niggar's heart, 
To hear de darkies singing. , 
Oh Nancy Fat, &c. 
FD OFFER THEE THIS HAND OF MINE, 
Music by L. Thayer Chadwick. 
I'd offer thee this hand of mine, 
If I 
could love thee less, 
But hearts as warm and pure as thine 
Should never know distress; 
My fortune is too hard for thee, 
'Twould chill thy dearest joy, 
I'd rather weep to see thee free, 
Than win thee to destroy. 
I'd offer thee, &e. 
I 
leave thee to thy happiness, 
As one too dear to love, 
As one I 
think of but to bless, 
As wretchedly I 
rove; 
But oh, when sorrow's cup I 
drink, 
All bitter though it be, 
How sweet 'ti ill be for me to think, 
It holds no drop for thee. 
I'd offer thee, &c. 
And now my dreams are sadly o'er, 
Fate bids them all depart, 
And I 
must leave my native shore, 
In brokenness of heart; 
Then oh, dear one, when far from thee, 
I 
ne'er know joy again, 
I 
would not that one th ,ught of me 
Should give thy bosom pain. 
I'd offer thee, dte.

HAPPY BE THY DREAMS. 
Oh, happy, happy, happy be thy dreams, 
Bright be the vision that before thee lies, 
Dreams of radiant hills and sunlit streams, 
Dreams of the bright and blue unclouded skies! 
Sleep— for thy mother watches by thy side; 
O'er thee, unseen, the watchful spirits glide. 
Pure as the star that o'er thee mildly beams, 
Oh, happy, happy, happy be thy dreams, 
Happy, happy, happy be thy dreams. 
Oh, happy, happy be thy path in life, 
Long still thy mother's tender love to share; 
Till Heaven has called her from this vale of strife, 
And purer bliss succeed to worldly care! 
Then, if the Angels earth-ward turn their eyes, 
She will watch o'er thee from the radiant skies. 
Sleep— while yon Star still o'er thee mildly beams, 
Oh, happy, happy, happy be thy dreams, 
Happy, happy, happy be thy dreams!

My cognomen is racketty Jack, a 
noisy swell am I, 
I 
care not how the world may wag, I 
never will say " die." 
In grog and beer I 
do indulge, sometimes in Cliquot true; 
A 
bottle of phiz is all my eye, bring in a 
dozen or two I

Hi! ! Hi! Stop! here Waiter, Phiz! Pop!

out in the flesh. 
Hi! Ho I 
Hi, &c.

Cabby's fare, 
Nor, like low swells wrench knockers off, and kick stalls in 
the air, 
For I 
can true enjoyment find with friends like you at my 
back, 
So fill up your glasses once again and drink with racketty 
Jack. 
Hi! Ho! Hi, &c. 
To the girls we love then let us drink wherever they may

For they are joly good fellows, which no one will deny.

THREE ROGUISH CHAPS. 
Spoken :— In good old colony times, when our forefathers 
were under the king, there were three Roguish chaps, who 
fell into mishaps, just because they could'nt sing. 
The Pub-
lisher would advise all boys to learn to sing, and then they will 
be found in the company f 
young Ladies enjoying a 
musical 
feast; this, will keep them from falling into mishaps. 
In good old colony times, 
When our Fathers were under the king, 
Three roguish chaps, fell into mishaps, 
Because they could not sing. 
Because they, SRL 
The first he was a 
Miller, 
And the second he was a 
Weaver, 
And the third he was a 
little Tailor, 
Three roguish chaps together, 
Three roguish, ece. 
Now, the Miller he stole corn, 
And the Weaver he stole yarn, 
And the little Tailor, stole broadcloth for 
To keep these three rogues warm. 
To keep, &a. 
The Miller got drown'd in his dam, 
The Weaver got hung in his yarn, 
And the sheriff clapp'd his paw on the little Tailor, 
With the broadcloth under his arm. 
With the broadcloth, &a. 
Now if these three roguish chaps, 
Who flourished under the king, 
Had lived to sea as much as me, 
They'd surely have learned to sing. 
They'd surely, ac. 
Then the Miller could sing to his love, 
And the Weaver comfort his wife, 
And the little Tailor, make ballads for, 
To keep these three rogues right.

THAT'S WHERE THE LAUGH COMES IN, 
Augustus Don Pedro, a 
handsome young man, 
Who ttaveled on shape, I 
am told, 
Determined to get, if he possibly could, 
A 
wife who had plenty of gold. 
So, filling his noddle with many a 
plan, 
By which he the lady could win, 
He hit upon one—which I 
shortly shall tell, 
And That's where the laugh comes in 
CHORUS. 
That's where the laugh comes in, ha! ha I 
That's where the laugh comes in ! 
'Twas owing all to the Income-tax, 
And That's where the laugh comes in! 
He borrowed a 
watch and a 
massive gold chain, 
Rings, studs, and in fact, all he could— 
Then sold them for Green- backs, and, shortly,befow 
The Income- Assessor he stood. 
He handed the money to one of the clerks, 
Who entered his name with a 
grin— 
He thought him a 
Nabob , and set him down such— 
And shortly— the laugh comes in ! 
That's where the laugh, &a. 
While eagerly scanning the paper, next day, 
To his great delight, did appear 
His name, with his income in figures set down 
At full twenty thousand per year. 
The plan was successful— he married the girl— 
And, though he was not worth a 
pin, 
His wits eot a 
wife who had plenty for both— 
And That's where the laugh comes in I 
That's where the laugh, &c. 
The father, enraged at the terrible 8e2Z, 
Determined the younir man to shoot ; 
But, turning the matter aemin in his mind, 
Concluded A

When calmer he crrew, he thought he would do 
The best that he could for his kin ; 
So he gave them the cash, and they cut quite a 
dash;

I'M LONELY SINCE MY MOTHER DIED. 
I'm lonely since mother died; 
Tho' friends and kindred gather near, 
I 
cannot check the rising sigh, 
Or stay the silent heart-felt tear. 
Of earthly friends, she was the best 
My erring youthful steps to guide; 
Oh I

I'm lonely since my mother died. 
CHORUS. 
I'm lonely since my mother died; 
Tho' friends and kindred gather near, 
I 
cannot check the rising & et, 
Or stay the heart- felt silent tear. 
You may not deem it brave or strong 
To let these tears so often flow; 
But those who've lost a 
mother's love, 
Can tell the pain of my sad woe. 
Could I 
but call her back again, 
And kneel once more down by her side, 
I'd love her better than before. 
I'm lonely since my mother died. 
Pm lonely, ite. 
0 you who ave a 
mother dear, 
Let not a 
word, or act, give pain; 
But cherish, love her with your life, 
You ne'er can have her like again. 
Then, when she's called from you away, 
Across death's dark and troubled tide, 
in pain, with me, you need not say; 
I'm lonely since my mother died.

NOBODY'S CHILD, 
Where I

really can't make out: 
And whether I 
was born at all, 
There seems to be a 
doubt; 
And, though I

To find that I

In fact: Nobody's child!

In fact: I'm Nobody's child! 
They found me 'neath a 
gooseberry-busl 
At the tender age of three; 
I 
don't belong to Nobody, 
Yet he belongs to me. 
Some horrid "blunder has been made

And I

But some one else's brother.

My uncle's sister's niece.

Nobody was 
father, as 
I 
have already said: 
Nobody: so, he must have been 
Made up of legs and head 
Although he had no body, yet,

Because he kept his legs.

She laughs and jokes on Vother side;

She'll meet me, at the door, 
With: Come in, lad, and warm yourself, 
You must be cold, I'm sure.

And lays them by my side,

Content to stay at home,

Her bright smile no more I'll see— 
And the loved ones, too, have parted;

Perhaps you think I'm green 
To come and sing before ye.: 
Brit that is to be seen, 
When I

Give attention to my ditty— 
For another one don't care;

arrived the other day. 
And as I 
was rather green, too, 
A nice young man I 
met— 
He said I

Be said my folks he knew, 
And it was quite a 
pity 
To see me rambling, round, 
A 
stranger in the city. 
He toted me about, 
To a 
Faro-bank he brought me.: 
Said he; Now bet a 
Five. 
I 
did as he besought me.; 
I 
lost and gave a 
ten: 
Got a 
Five, in change, so pretty : 
Twas a 
counterfeit I 
gave: 
Pm a stranger in the city ! 
While strolling thro' the street, 
I 
met two fellows fighting: 
A 
girl they fought about, 
How loving and exciting! 
The maiden stood alone: 
I 
thought it was a 
pity : 
So, quickly saw her home: 
I'm a 
stranger in the. city. 
She bade me stop awhile, 
To introduce me to her cousins , 
And soon they tumbled in: 
She had them by the dozen"! 
Don't go away! said she.

But you can't come over me : 
I'm a 
stranger in the city!

BETTER LATE THAN NEVER. 
What folly 'tis for man to fret and waste his days repining, 
I 
care not though the sun is set, he still is somewhere shining; 
The clouds that hover round him now will not be there forever 
The icy chains which winter links, the spring-time sun will 
sever. 
CHORUS. 
Why, then, why, why not use the strong endeavor— 
Try, men, try, ' tis better late than never. 
Should fortune fly, yet still proceed, ail :thoughts of danger 
scorning, 
The lane is long and straight, indeed, that has not got a 
turning ; 
'Tis not the wish that makes men great, 'tis works proclaim 
them clever, 
A battle won, ttiough long begun, is better late than never. 
Why, then, &c. 
Then onward be the watchward, still each man on himself re-
lying— 
The way comes friendly with the will, there is nothing lost 
by trying; 
So if success we can't command, to gain it let's endeavor, 
For great or small, if it comes at all, 'tis bet ter late than neveL. 
Why, then, &c. 
WHAT CAN THE MATTER BE. 
At sixteen years old you could get little good of me, 
'Twas then I 
saw Norah, who soon understood of me, 
I 
was in love—but myself, for the blood of me, 
Could not tell what I 
did ail. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas, dear, dear I 
but what can the matter be r 
Och! botheration ! what can the matter be! 
Och! gramachree! what can the matter be! 
Bothered from head to the tail! 
I 
went to confess to Father O'Flannigan— 
Told him my case—made an end—then began again. 
Father,. says I, make me soon my own man again, 
If you can find out what I 
ail. 
Oh ! dear, dear, says he, &c:. 
Soon I 
fell sick—I 
did bellow and curse again— 
Norah took pity to see me at nurse again ; 
Gave me a 
kiss, but ocli ! that made me worse again, 
Well she knew what I 
did ail. 
But dear, dear, says she, &c.. 
long- ago, now, since I 
left Tipperary— 
How strange, growing older, our nature should vary!, 
All symptoms are gone of my ancient quandary, 
Yet I 
cannot tell now what I

Still, dear, dear, says he, &a..

Oh! the days are gone, when Beauty bright 
My heart's chain wove ; 
When my dream of life, from morn fill night, 
Was love, still love. 
New hope may bloom, 
And days may come, 
Of milder, calmer beam, 
But there's nothing half so sweet in life 
As love's young dream! 
No, there's nothing half so sweet in life 
As love's young dream. 
l'ho' the bard to purer fame neTy soar, 
When wild youth's past, 
Tho' he win the wise, who frown'd be-
2crle, 
To smile at last; 
He'll never meet 
A 
joy so sweet, 
In all his noon of fame, 
As when first he sung to woman's ea 
His soul-felt flame. 
And, at every close, she blush'd to hear 
The one loY'd name. 
Oh! that hallow'd form is ne'er forgot, 
Which first love trac'd; 
Still it lingering haunts the greenest spat 
On mem'ry's waste. 
'Twas odor fled 
As soon as sly cl; 
'Twas morning's wing, d

'Twas a

should meet her, I'm resolved without delay, 
To implore and to entreat her to name the wedding day. 
Oh! early in the morning, &c. 
THE SLEIGH RIDE. 
Descriptive Glee 
Merrily, merrily sound the bells, 
As over the ground we roll, 
When the snow drift breaks 
in silvery flakes, 
Beside our coriole. 
When wrapt in buffaloes, soft and warm, 
With mantle and tippet tight, 
We cheerily cleave the fleecy storm, 
Or skim in the cold moonlight. 
Merrily sound, fke. 
Merrily, merrily sonna the bells 
Upon the wind without. 
When the wine is mulled, 
And the waffle culled. 
And the song is passed about; 
When rosy lips and dimpled cheeks 
The welcome jest inspire, 
And mirth in many a 
bright eye speaks 
Around the hickory fire. 
Merrily sound, &c.

WHEN SAMMY COXES HOME. 
Words and Music by G. W. Hum 
I 
love a 
valiant soldier bold, 
Nineteen years old, with plenty of gold 
On his dress, and if the truth he's told 
He's awful fond of me. 
The one that I 
love his name is Sam, 
Such a 
darling is Sam, without any cram; 
I 
like him far better than raspberry jam, 
For his like yet I 
never did see. 
cifolius. 
0. sha'n't I 
be glad when Sammy comes home, 
When Sammy comes home, when Sammy comes home, 
Oh sha'n't I 
be glad when Sammy comes home, 
When Sammy comes home in the morning. 
• 
He wears a 
red coat and a 
sword by his side, 
With spurs on his heels and long whiskers beside, 
And sometimes has a 
big horse for to ride, 
0 
don't he look martial and grand. 
On the top of his hat a 
feather there grows, 
Put there I 
supi:ose to show how the wind blows, 
His hair is Magenta, and so is his nose; 
With the handsomest form in the land. 
0, sha'n't I 
be glad, &o. 
My Sammy has travelled to many a 
shore, 
Where the elephants fly and the crocodiles roar, 
And, oh, should he never come back any more, 
For my Sammy l'd die in despair. 
No one could imagine what he has gone thro', 
He can talk foreign languages until all is blue; 
French, Dutch, Spanish, Persian, and Irish, too, 
To hear him would make you all stare, 
0 
sha'n't I 
be glad, &o. 
I 
shall never forget when he told me his love, 
And vowed by :, 11 the stars above, 
And squeezed my poor fingers as well as my glove, 
I 
believed every word that he said. 
But, oh, when he said that abroad he must hie, 
And wished me good-bye, I 
thought I 
should die, 
So I 
sat myself down and had a 
good cry • 
For without him I'd surely be dead. 
Oh, sha'n't I 
be glad, i&c.

HARK! I HEAR AN ANGEL SING. 
Hark! I 
hear an angel sing— 
Angels now are on the wing; 
And their voices, singing clear, 
Tell us that the spring is near. 
Dost thou hear them, gentle one ? 
Dost thou see the glorious sun 
Rising higher in the sky, 
As each day, as each day it passes by? 
CHORUS. 
Hark! I 
hear an angel sing--
Angels now are on the wing; 
And their voices, singing clear, 
Tell us that the spring is near. 
Just beyond yon cliff of snow, 
Silver rivers brightly flow; 
Smiling woods and fields are seen, 
Mantled in a 
robe of green. 
Birds, and bees, and brooks and flowers, 
Tell us all of vernal hours. 
There the birds are weaving lays 
For the happy, happy spring-time days. 
Hark! I 
hear, &c. 
Look! oh, look! the southern sky 
Mirrors flowers of every dye, 
Children, tripping o'er the plain; 
Spring is coming back again_ 
Spring is coming! shouts of glee: 
Singing birds on bush and tree, 
And the bees; their merry hums; 
For the spring-time comes, it comes, it comes! 
Hark! I 
hear, &c.

THE MOON BEHIND THE HILL. 
I 
watch'd last night the rising moon 
Upon a 
foreign strand; 
Till mem'ries came like flow'rs of June, 
Of home, and father-land; 
I 
dream't I 
was a 
child once more, 
Beside the rippling rill ; 
When first I 
saw, in days of yore 
Repeat. 
The moon behind the hill. 
It brought me back the visions grand 
That purpled boyhood's dreams: 
It's youthful loves, its happy land, 
As bright as morning beams; 
It brought me back the spreading lea, 
The steeple and the mill; 
Until my eyes coul I 
scarcely see 
The moon behind the hill. 
Repeat. 
It broughtme back a 
mother's love, 
Until, in accents wild, 
I 
prayed her from her home above 
To guard her lonely child; 
It brought me one across the wave, 
To live in mem'ry still; 
It brought me back my Mary's 
The moon behind the hill. 
grave Repeat. 
And there beneath the silv'ryjsky, 
I 
lived life o'er again ; 
I 
counted all its hopes gone by 
I 
wept at all its pain; 
And when I'm gone, oh! may some tongue, 
The minstrel's wish fulfil; 
And still remember him who sang, 
epeat.
