January 11,  1980:
 Discussion of ethnic tours.
 Present:
 Joe Wilson,
 
Dick Shea,  Kathy Pfieffer,  Bill Kornrich of NCTA:  Bess Hawes,
 
Dan Sheehy, NEA
 
Characteristics of the ethnic tour program:
 
1)
 Tours are made up of ad hoc assemblages of artists,  the
 
finest that can be found from all parts of the country.
 Each
 
touring group,  therefore, must be funded for a rehearsal period
 
as well as the tour itself.
 
2)
 Tours are planned primarily to reach audiences of the
 
same ethnicity though the general public is also welcome.
 Sites
 
will be chosen accordingly,  though one or two general public
 
concerts can be included for financial reasons.
 
3)
 Tours will be planned and staffed by the best possible
 
cultural experts available as artistic directors and presenters.
 
Knowledgable scholars will be involved as well as practicing
 
cultural activists.
 
4)
 Tours will feature musical and dance styles traditional
 
within the particular ethnicity.
 Modern or emergent forms may
 
or may not be included;  traditional forms always will be.
 
5)
 There will be an educational component included in each
 
presentation, by whatever means are appropriate -- informational
 
programs,  presenter's remarks, public announcements, posters,
 
translation techniques etc.
 
6)
 Each tour will be planned to create a wake,  to maintain
 
some kind of continuing relationship with the community visited
 
after the tour moves on,  to maximize the impact of the tour
 
visit while the folks are there.
 Appearances on local radio and
 
television programs,  guest concerts in schools, master classes
 
and/or informal sessions with local musicians and dancers will
 
be scheduled in every possible location.
 
10  
-2-
Ethnic tours discussed:
 
1)
 Appalachian tour (currently funded and being planned
 
by Joe Wilson and Bill Kornrich)
 
2)
 French tour (possible venture being considered by
 
Missouri Friends of the Folk Arts to visit Missouri and Louisiana
 
under leadership of Kathy Pfieffer.
 Some discussion of second
 
leg of tour hitting New England; possibility of inclusion of
 
Mitchiff Indians also mentioned.)
 
3
)
 Jewish tour to feature Klezmer music  (possible venture
 
being investigated by Bill Kornrich.
 Mark Slobin,  Ruth Rubin,
 
Mr.  Zopoznick and Balkan Arts personnel recommended as consultants.
 
4)
 Mexican-American tours.
 (Two possibilities -- a tour
 
through central California valley and another from Texas north
 
through the midwest being discussed by Dan Sheehy and Dick Shea.
 
Tour organizer needed.)
 
5)
 Puerto Rican tour.
 (Dan mentioned possibility of organizing
 
Puerto Rican/Newyorican tour to be organized by Hector Vega,
 
Puerto Rican ethnomusicologist.)
 
Organizational problems:
 
1)
 NCTA,  in order to mount a tour activity greater than
 
the current Irish and Appalachian effort, would need staff
 
additional to Dick Shea.
 Bess and Dan will see about the
 
Expansion Arts institutional support grant.
 
2)
 Dick Shea,  if he returns to school, may be able to work
 
part-time on touring;  whether or not, he needs to start training
 
some full or part-time help.
 
3)
 Folk Arts will need to estimate total costs carefully
 
especially in view of the energy situation and rising trans-
portation expenses.
 Continuing on a one-grant-per-tour basis
 
for the next year may prove the wisest course.
 
4)
 It was agreed that,  although NCTA is currently interested
 
and active in developing an ethnic touring program,  neither NCTA
 
or Folk Arts is bound to this.
 Folk Arts will continue to consider
 
suitable applications from other organizations,  if any are received;
 
NCTA will continue to keep all its irons hot and will seek advice
 
from its board before getting much further into the business.
 
All options were to stay open for the time being.

U 
Thank you for agreeing to attend our working meeting on folk arts touring.  The
 
meeting will be held May 14 and 15 in room 730 of the Old Post Office Building,
 
1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., here in Washington.  We plan to meet from 9am
 
to 5
:30pm on Thursday the 14th and from 9am to lunchtime (
hopefully no later
 
than 1pm) on Friday the 15th.
 
By way of background information, we are sending you three items.  First is a
 
memorandum of understanding drawn up several years back clarifying the general
 
type of "ethnic tours" that the Folk Arts Program would fund.  Second is a
 
funding history of tours we have supported over the years.  Third is a working
 
agenda with a few suggested topics for the discussion.
 
As you may see from these documents, the Folk Arts Program has supported the
 
touring of traditional music and dance since the Program's inception in 1978.
 
Most Folk Arts-funded tours have been gatherings of the very best musicians
 
and dancers in a given ethnic tradition (
for example, Irish, Italian, Mexican,
 
Afro-American, and so forth) performing in venues likely to attract audiences
 
of those same communities.  Over the past recent years, more traditional artists
 
have shown interest in finding new audiences and opportunities to perform, and
 
at the same time, an increasing number of professional multi-discipline
 
presenters have contacted us in search of high quality traditional arts to
 
include in their annual programming.  The primary purpose of our meeting is to
 
bring together folk arts tour producers, artists, agents, presenters, regional
 
arts organizations and others involved in touring to discuss the potential
 
problems and advantages of taking traditional folk artists to broader audiences.
 
We hope you have had the opportunity to make all the necessary arrangements for
 
your travel and a place to s
tay here in Washington.  If you have any problems or
 
questions, please do not hesitate to contact Dan Sheehy here in the Folk Arts
 
Program at 202/682-5449.  We all very much look forward to seeing you in the
 
next couple of weeks.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Director, Folk Arts Program

January 11, 1980:
 Discussion of ethnic tours.
 Present:
 Joe Wilson,
 
Dick Shea, Kathy Pfieffer, Bill Kornrich of NCTA; Bess Hawes,
 
Dan Sheehy, NEA
 
Characteristics of the ethnic tour program:
 
1)
 Tours are made up of ad hoc assemblages of artists,  the
 
finest that can be found from all parts of the country.
 Each
 
touring group,  therefore, must be funded for a rehearsal period
 
as well as the tour itself.
 
2
)
 Tours are planned primarily to reach audiences of the
 
same ethnicity though the general public is also welcome.
 Sites
 
will be chosen accordingly,  though one or two general public
 
concerts can be included for financial reasons.
 
3
)
 Tours will be planned and staffed by the best possible
 
cultural experts available as artistic directors and presenters.
 
Knowledgable scholars will be involved as well as practicing
 
cultural activists.
 
4)
 Tours will feature musical and dance styles traditional
 
within the particular ethnicity.
 Modern or emergent forms may
 
or may not be included; traditional forms always will be.
 
5)
 There will be-an educational component included in each
 
presentation, by whatever means are appropriate -- informational
 
programs, presenter's remarks, public announcements, posters,
 
translation techniques etc.
 
6)
 Each tour will be planned to create a wake,  to maintain
 
some kind of continuing relationship with the community visited
 
after the tour moves on,  to maximize the impact of the tour
 
visit while the folks are there.
 Appearances on local radio and
 
television programs,  guest concerts in schools, master classes
 
and/or informal sessions with local musicians and dancers will
 
be scheduled in every possible location.

Ethnic tours discussed:
 
1)
 Appalachian tour (currently funded and being planned
 
by Joe Wilson and Bill Kornrich)
 
2)
 French tour (possible venture being considered by
 
Missouri Friends of the Folk Arts to visit Missouri and Louisiana
 
under leadership of Kathy Pfieffer.
 Some discussion of second
 
leg of tour hitting New England; possibility of inclusion of
 
Mitchiff Indians also mentioned.)
 
3
)
 Jewish tour to feature Klezmer music  (possible venture
 
being investigated by Bill Kornrich.
 Mark Slobin,  Ruth Rubin,
 
Mr. Zopoznick and Balkan Arts personnel recommended as consultants.)
 
4)
 Mexican-American tours.
 (Two possibilities -- a tour
 
through central California valley and another from Texas north
 
through the midwest being discussed by Dan Sheehy and Dick Shea.
 
Tour organizer needed.)
 
5)
 Puerto Rican tour.
 (Dan mentioned possibility of organizing
 
Puerto Rican/Newyorican tour to be organized by Hector Vega,
 
Puerto Rican ethnomusicologist.)
 
Organizational problems:
 
1)
 NCTA,  in order to mount a tour activity greater than
 
the current Irish and Appalachian effort, would need staff
 
additional to Dick Shea.
 Bess and Dan will see about the
 
Expansion Arts institutional support grant.
 
2
)
 Dick Shea,  if he returns to school, may be able to work
 
part-time on touring; whether or not, he needs to start training
 
some full or part-tirne help.
 
3
)
 Folk Arts wi ll  need to estimate total costs carefully
 
especially in view of the energy situation and rising trans-
portation expenses.
 Continuing on a one-grant-per-tour basis
 
for the next year may prove the wisest course.
 
4)
 It was agreed that,  although NCTA is currently interested
 
and active in developing an ethnic touring program,  neither NCTA
 
or Folk Arts is bound to this.
 Folk Arts will continue to consider
 
suitable applications from other organizations,  if any are received;
 
NCTA will continue to keep all its irons hot and will seek advice
 
from its board before getting much further into the business.
 
All options were to stay open for the ,time being.

FOLK ARTS PROGRAM
 
MEETING ON FOLK ARTS TOURING, MAY 14-15
 
The following is a tentative l
ist of issues,  roughly arranged
 
along the order of an agenda.
 I
t i
s not meant to be
 
comprehensive, nor should anyone at the meeting feel obliged to
 
stick to the particular issues outlined.
 Rather,  it i
s only an
 
attempt to get us all thinking in the same direction.
 
I
.
 "In-reach" and "Out-reach" Touring
 
What are the advantages and disadvantages or "outreach" touring
 
(
touring to the broadest possible audiences) as opposed to
 
"
inreach" touring (
taking traditional artists of a particular
 
cultural group to audiences of the same background,  e
.g.,
 
I
talian-American artists to I
talian communities in the
 
Northeast,  or cowboy artists to ranching  areas of the West)?
 
Under what c
ircumstances is outreach touring most desirable?
 
What kinds of groups should be toured to professional presenters?
 
I
s there a developmental relationship between inreach touring
 
and outreach touring?  How can the two strategies be
 
complementary?
 
How can the inreach benefits of touring (
for example, validation
 
of the arttists and art forms in the minds of their own
 
community members,  involvement of the local ethnic communities
 
in the sponsoring, organization, and attendance of performances)
 
be enhanced in touring to professional presenters?
 
I
I.
 Production and Packaging in Outreach Touring
 
How should production values and approach be tailored to make
 
folk tours as competitive as any other art form among presenters
 
and their audiences?
 I
s special technical expertise of
 
equipment needed?
 
What are the needs and l
imitations of folk artists and folk arts
 
tours in terms of time, programming, and special care?  Are
 
there imaginative ways to accomodate these needs and l
imitations
 
(
for example, short "weekend tours" for artists with full-time
 
jobs)?
 
Are there other alternative forms of touring that would be of
 
mutual benefit to artists and presenters?
 
Are there advantages in a regional approach to touring?
 
What types of promotional materials and promotional strategies
 
are needed?  Are there certain values to folk arts tours that
 
would be particularly attractive to presenters?
 
What additional activities could accompany folk arts -
-
exhibits,  recordings, written materials,  f
ilms,  local workshops,
 
local performance parties?
 
I
II.
 "BROKERING" AND FUNDING
 
How can working relationships be made between folk artists and
 
both small presenters (
e.g.  $2,500-$5,000 fee range and in small
 
to middle-sized communities) and major presenters (
in the
 
$5,000-plus fee range) who would be interested in expanding
 
there variety of programming to the general public to include
 
folk artists?
 
Are there already institutions and mechanisms in place that can
 
better l
ink up traditional artists and the touring/presenting
 
network?  Should some kind of new something be created to broker
 
traditional artists with presenters in an ongoing way?
 
What are the available financial resources available to fund
 
folk arts tour to wide audiences?  How can new partnerships be
 
forged to support folk tours?
 
Are there special financial needs particular to folk arts
 
touring?

Although projects in the folk arts had lona been funded
.
 
by Music,  Dance, Media, Museums and other Arts Endowment programs
 
it was not until 1978 that a formal Folk Arts Program was
 
established and given a separate budget and staff.
 The director,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes,  is ably assisted by two arts specialists --
Daniel Sheehy whose special areas of interest are music and
 
Hispanic arts  (Dan is f
luent in Spanish),  and Sally Yerkovich,
 
who is particularly concerned with visual arts and media.
 
Administrative concerns and grants management are under the
 
capable supervision of Martha Kuenhold and Rose Morgan.
 
Secretary Pat Makell rounds out the small but energetic staff.
 
Since it is one of the Endowment's newest programs,  Folk
 
Arts has the smallest budget allocation and therefore has had
 
to consider its priorities with the greatest care.
 Many projects
 
that might ordinarily be thought of as in the folk arts area,
 
therefore,  do not as of now qualify under our necessarily strict
 
definition.
 The Program hopes eventually to be able to loosen
 
its restrictions as more  funds become available.
 
Essentially,  the Program feels its top priority must be
 
the preservation and
. the protection of the older art forms now
 
in danger of being forgotten,  or simply drowned out by the
 
noisier and more glamorous contemporary arts.
 As the Endowment's
 
Five Year Plan puts it:
 
"The Folk Arts Program illustrates the depth of the
 
Endowment's dedication to artistic excellence in its attempts
 
to nurture the many and varied roots from which artistic
 
initiatives spring....  The Folk Arts Program works to encourage,
 
protect,  and preserve living artistic traditions that are
 
- 2 -
 
examples of our rich cultural history,  thereby protecting and
 
preserving wellsprings of artistic variety within all art forms."
 
Thus,  the Folk Arts Program does not support general
 
ethnic arts festivals; we do, however, help fund those sections
 
of such festivals where traditional artists can display their
 
skills,  thereby giving them honor and encouraging the young
 
people to learn from them.
 Further,  the Program supports a
 
small apprenticeship program through which the very finest of
 
our traditional craftsworkers and musicians can pass their
 
skills on directly.
 Finally,  the Program encourages documenta-
tion of the older skills,  so that they can be studied by those
 
who may not have an opportunity to observe them directly.
 
The Program has generally found the finest practitioners
 
of the folk arts are those who have been brought up within
 
traditional communities,  learning their art as they live their
 
everyday lives.
 In this way,  artists learn the aesthetic ideas
 
that lie behind the particular art form,  as well as "how to do
 
them".
 
Examples of projects that have been supported by Folk Arts
 
include:
 support for Los Angeles Mexican-American musicians
 
to study traditional harp styles with senior jarocho harpists;
 
support for a traveling exhibit of traditional crafts practiced
 
by Blacks in  southeastern  Mississippi,  including pottery,
 
quilt-making and
. blacksmithing;  support for workshops in willow
 
basketry and pottery by senior crafts women of the Pueblo
 
Indians in New Mexico;  support for artists'  fees for the tradi-
tional musicians,  singers and dancers participating in a
 
Caribbean-American cultural festival in New York City.

Position Paper on "World Music"
 
From:
 Bess Hawes/Daniel
•
 
talking
 
In considering what,  for purposes of brevity, we are
 
momentarily (we hope)  calling "world music"
 there are a few
 
considerations to bear in mind:
 
1.
 What are we really 
 about? 
Basically,
 the
 
non-European classic performing arts -- the high arts of Asia,
 
the near-East 
• Africa.
 These are not folk
 
they are both highly professionalized and formally taught.
 
Though these presentations are based on music, most also involve
 
theater and/or dance
 
2.
 Why should the Arts Endowment be concerned?
 
a.
 Because many U.S.  citizens
• 
•  Asia and the
 
Near-East and would be pleased to have their formal as well as
 
well as their folk and emerging arts supported.
 
• 
Because many other U.S.  citizens are interested.
 
traditions.
 
In the museum world,  federal support for exhibits of the arts
 
of the Far East, Africa,  and the rest,  is accepted as a common-
place and a natural public responsibility in the interest of
 
increasing general public sophistication.
 
C.
 Because many citizens,  especially Afro-Americans,
 
are deeply interested in learning about their ancestral artistic
 
d.
 Because many U.S.  citizens are concerned with
 
Alternate life styles and philosophy
 and are turning towards
 
eastern philosophic and aesthetic ideas.
 
e. 
Because if we don't pay these world-renowned arts
 
at least a bit of attention, we will be vulnerable to charges
 
of provincialism and worse.

. 
Who performs these arts?
 
a.
 U.S.  performing ensembles from the "ethnic"  community
 
(
e.g.  Chinese opera companies in many U.S.  cities).

the oud etc.
 Some replicate the classic music appropriate to
 
the instrument;  others use the instruments in jazz or modern
 
music contexts.
 
d.
 Lots of students ensembles, mostly centered at a
 
few universities, primarily those with ethnomusicology or
 
dance departments.
 
e.
 Foreign ensembles and solo artists touring the
 
United States.
 
4
.
 Who presents these arts?
 
a.
 A few special-interest organizations such as the
 
Alternative Center for International Arts,  the East-West Center,
 
etc.
 
b.
 Community ethnic organizations  (e.g.  Chinese Bene-
volent Societies);  these groups usually confine themselves to
 
presenting their own particular art forms and are not interested
 
in other peoples'.
 
C.
 Community °
'ethnic" voluntary cultural schools  (
e.g.
 
after-school classes for Japanese children in the Japanese
 
language and Japanese arts).
 
d.
 Colleges and universities,  especially those with
 
ethnomusicology or musicology programs.
 
e.
 Commercial concert bureaus.
 
5
.
 What should we do about it?
 
a.
 Move cautiously,  recognizing that nobody in the
 
whole Endowment  (with the possible exception of Dan Sheehy)
 
knows much about it.
 This is an area where bad funding would
 
be disastrous in effect.
 
b.
 Call a small working meeting of advisors  (
some
 
suggested names are attached)  plus representatives from Special
 
Projects,  Dance,  Opera/Music Theater, Music, Folk Arts, Expansion
 
Arts,  International,  and  (
possibly)  I.C.A.  to discuss what the
 
Endowment and other funding agencies are already doing in this
 
field and what might be done.
 This group should address funding
 
strategy, vis-a-vis artists/presenters;  organizational support/
 
project support;  tours/media, etc.
 Several possible outcomes:
 
1
.
 A working list of consultants, who could be
 
called upon by the various programs for expert advice,  as various
 
groups apply under normal program guidelines  (
no cost or minimum
