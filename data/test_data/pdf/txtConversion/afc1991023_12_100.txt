TXO1: (This is a second go—round at interviewing Mr. Marquez. 
It 
follows about 20 minutes after the first attempt, 
in which after 
set up and checking everything out, I did something wrong in the 
actual recording procedure, and the reel was blank when we were 
done. 
Mr. Marquez was very philosophical about the problem, and 
encouraged me to fool with the machine and figure out what had 
gone wrong. 
He was interested in hearing how he would sound on 
tape, and after we had figured out the taping problem and 
decompressed a bit, he said "Why don't we do 
it again?", so we 
went through the interview a second time. 
In some ways, this was 
helpful, and there was a lot less time spent in uncomfortable 
silence, as Marquez had really warmed to the idea by this time 
and seemed much less shy of the equipment. 
He had also collected 
his thoughts on some of the questions, I suppose, as the first 
attempt netted a lot of gestural and facial expression—type 
responses, which were informative in the context of conversation, 
but not useful for taping; the second time around, his responses 
were more fully verbalized. 
The interview was conducted outdoors, at the door of the 
cranberry packing house G—Birches Road; 25GT. 
Mr. Marquez sat on a 
high stool, which he had brought out to the doorway for the 
purpose, and I sat on the ground nearby. 
No machinery was 
running in the packing house at the time of the interview, as 
berries from the day's harvest had not yet begun to be put 
through the sorter.)

INTERVIEW CONDUCTED IN ENGLISH (See corresponding 
fieldnotes.) QUOTES APPEAR IN THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH THEY WERE 
SPOKEN. 
(0 minutes) 
Mr. Marquez has been working out at Birches for "20— 
some" years. 
He first found out about the job through a friend 
of his who worked at the employment office. 
At the time he 
started, his job included driving about thirty people a day over 
from Philadelphia to work on the harvest, when they used to still 
harvest by scooping the berries by hand. The workers who were 
residents of the Pines were "the same people that live here now," 
and the workers who came in with Marquez were seasonal workers 
who lived 
in Philly. 
There are many fewer people coming back and 
forth to the harvest nowadays, because "they do 
it with the 
machine, now." 
"Before" the berries had to be gotten up with a scoop, 
brought to the packing house in boxes; they would bring in quite 
a few boxes before they started working the packing house. 
They 
would pick for a couple of weeks before they started working the 
packing house. 
The picking season was longer then; "sometimes we 
stayed here two months." The work season lasted about twice as 
long then, and they had about thirty people working. 
Now, 10 or 
12 people can do the work. 
The switch to machine harvesting and 
sorting happened about 10 years ago. 
The old sorting machine was "some sort of shake machine", 
and a man would dump the berries into it. 
The machines shake the 
trash and dirt out, "the leaves, and all that." 
The machine 
distinguished the rotten berries and trash from good berries by 
means of brushes; the wrong stuff gets brushed to one side, 
because it 
is soft, or the wrong shape. 
The hard berries keep on 
going by. 
It takes four people to do the sorting nowadays: 
two 
at the top ( at the feed end of the machine), and two at the 
bottom. 
There are only two women working at Birches — George's wife, 
Bea, and Orlando Torres' wife, Hazel. 
They do the hand—sorting, 
at the end of the conveyer belt, right before the berries go into 
the crates. 
They pick out whatever the sorting machine has 
missed. 
G—Tabernacle Twp., 25GT 
The crates or boxes into which the berries are loaded are 
950 pound boxes. 
Hazel and Bea pick out "quite a few little 
boxes" of bad berries missed by the sorter each day. 
They put 
them into smallish, rectangular wooden boxes, to be thrown out; 
these boxes used to be the ones that were used to bring the 
berries in from the bogs 
in the days of hand harvesting. 
Bad 
berries will be thrown out "for the deers." 
G—Tabernacle twp., 
25GT 
The deer eat "a lot of berries" around Birches; "sometimes 
they run all over down here." 
They come out in the daytime as 
well 
as at night. 
George once saw a doe try to cross a bog when 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 2 
it had water in 
it, and she fell 
in, but since deer can swim, she 
got across all 
right. (wind noise) 
(5) 
15 or 20 years ago, when Marquez brought harvesters 
over from Philly, he brought them over in a bus. 
Of the thirty 
that he brought, he estimates that most of them were "Americans", 
and only four or five Puerto Ricans. 
(When I askes him, for 
clarification, 
if they were mostly "nortenos, gringos", 
i.e., 
anglos, he said, "whoever I can get; mixed." 
Now, he drives over 
only four or five people, including three Haitian men. 
The 
whole time that Marquez has been working at Birches, he has 
worked in the packing house; he hasn't really been a part of the 
harvest, but "when we scoop it, I used to take care of the men in 
the field, myself. 
I used to be, you know, watch the field, make 
sure that they're picking right, you know." 
The berries would be 
put into the smaller boxes, which are now used for bad berries. 
There were men whose job it was to put these boxes into trucks, 
and bring them back to the packing house when the truck was full. 
What Marquez now does in the packing house is work the tail 
end of the conveyor belt. 
He makes sure that the washed, sorted 
berries get into their 950 pound boxes. 
"Then, when the trailer 
comes, I load them in the truck." 
The trailer comes from the cannery. 
Marquez loads it, using 
a fork lift. 
The crates are placed at the end of the conveyor 
belt, on a scale. 
Each box must be weighed individually. 
The 
berries come off the conveyor belt through a spout which fills 
the boxes. 
When a box 
is full, the spout flips to the other 
side, ready to fill another box. 
Berries don't have to be 
levelled off as the boxes fill; 
it can be done at the end, when 
the box 
is full. 
Not every day produces a full 
load of boxes to go out to the 
cannery, though "right now", at the height of the harvest, they 
do go out every day. 
44 boxes of 950 lbs. each make up one 
trailer load. 
All of this harvesting is done now by about a 
dozen people. 
"Put a lot of people out of work, this machine, 
you know that?" 
The machines are good "for the business people," 
but bad for "the poor people, the working people." 
Almost all 
of 
the farmers got their machinery at about the same time, and a lot 
of people lost their jobs. 
"They go someplace, get another job, 
I guess." 
(airplane noise) 
Most of the people who were are affected by the job loss due 
to mechanization were the people who came in from elsewhere to 
work. 
"The other people stay around here." 
There is a Puerto Rican community in Chatsworth, which is 
made up mostly of people who live there the year around. 
They 
mostly work for Haines, 
in blueberries and cranberries. 
There is 
also a Puerto Rican community in Tabernacle, and they mostly work 
in fruit, 
"apples, and peaches, strawberries, and all kind of 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 3 
fruit; 
I don't think they got cranberries." 
Blueberry season 
starts about the 24th of June; 
it 
is over by now, 
in fact by 
August. 
(10) 
I asked if 
it was part of his job to drive people 
here, or 
if that was something the grower hired him to do: 
"No, 
I just like to come down here, you know." 
Marquez likes to come 
down to the Birches for a few weeks, to get away from the city. 
The thing he 
likes best about this part of New Jersey is the 
quiet. "You know, I like peace place, nice, the quiet; that's 
what I like. 
And then I can walk, and I don't have to worry 
about behind me, somebody might hit me." 
He likes to go for 
walks during the day when things are slow at the packing house. 
He walks on the dams and roads that connect the bogs. 
There are 
"no big animals" out here to see, but he does see deer 
occasionally, and rabbits. 
There aren't any snakes around any 
more, because of "too much fertilize; they go away." 
The growers fertilize the berries and give them a lot of 
care: 
pruning, fertilizing, spraying, "all 
like that." 
They 
prune them with a riding machine like a lawnmower, put the 
cuttings in rows, and go get them in a truck and "lug 'em out." 
The clippings are not used for anything, just thrown out in the 
woods. 
After they prune the berries, they fill the bogs with 
water, and leave them that way till springtime. 
If they are not 
under water during the winter, "They cook the vines, they burn 
the vines" — i.e., the vines get frostbitten and die. 
When the 
weather begins go get "a little warm," they let the water out. 
Then they have to bring bees in. They rent the bees, and put out 
"so many boxes, each place." 
The bees have to go to every 
flower; 
if they don't have bees, they won't have berries. 
The 
growers don't raise bees themselves, but rent them. 
The 
beekeeper brings them in and sets out the hives, "so far apart." 
They leave the bees out until the harvest time: 
"They just took 
them off the other day when we start (sic) work." 
The 
cranberries flower in the spring; their flowers are "kind of red 
and white inside." 
9 
Sometimes Marquez comes down here just to get away from the 
city, but basically he comes here to work, during September and 
October. 
He has had the same job 
in Philly for 22 years, and 
takes his vacation time, plus some extra time that his boss there 
lets him go for, to come out to Birches to work. 
Marquez would like to be able to move out here to 
live some 
day, but "le falta la plata" (idiom, he doesn't have enough 
money) to buy out here. 
"It's very expensive here now." 
Everything is going up all over (in price). 
He would love to 
"move out here, not here, exactly; someplace in Jersey," to live 
in the country. 
It would be nice to keep a garden in the summer. 
(15) 
Marquez sometimes makes his own cranberry juice. He 
boils them, then strains the pulp through a cloth bag, "then you 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 4 
mix so much sugar and so much water." 
If you don't add water "it 
will be too thick, 
it turns to jello." 
"It's very nice. 
This 
tastes better than the one you buy from the store." 
He doesn't 
bother to make cranberry sauce or relish because the canning 
house sends the workers some. 
The berries that he uses for his 
juice are given to him by the grower; "I ask for a few; they give 
them to you." 
But the grower here is strictly a wholesale 
seller; even if someone wanted 20 Ibs, he won't "sell them to 
nobody." 
The canning house claims them all, though many people 
come by to ask 
if they can buy. 
At this particular farm, owned by Thompson, only George and 
Orlando speak Spanish. 
Over at Haines's place, "he got quite a 
few." 
"They tell me that's all he got working (Puerto Ricans); 
there might be some 
American too, you know. 
You know, that live 
around there." 
Marquez doesn't know of any players of Bomba and Plena music 
in this area, though in Philadelphia, he says, there are a lot of 
places to go and hear Puerto Rican music, including performers 
who come up from the island on tour. 
Marquez hears about them by 
listening to the Spanish language radio program. 
Puerto Rican food ingredients, to make "comida criolla" can 
be gotten at any big store, like the acme supermarket. 
He thinks 
that the small stores around here wouldn't carry the products, 
and that Puerto Ricans who live in the Pines and want to maintain 
their Puerto Rican eating styles would have to go to Mount Holly, 
where the nearest Acme market is. 
Any "big store" would have it.

TX01: Interview was conducted at the home G—Birches Road; 25GT of 
Orlando and Hazel Torres, seated at the kitchen table. 
Joseph 
Czarnecki was present for a part of the time, and occasionally 
added a question or comment. 
The Torres' children, Amanda and 
Joshua, ages 1 and 3 years, respectively, were also present, and 
up past their usual bedtimes. 
They account for a lot of the 
distraction and additional noise, as they were up to the usual 
business of people their age, and required a lot of attention 
from one or both parents at times; Joshua was also fascinated 
with the recording equipment and kept asking about it and 
reaching for various parts of 
it throughout the interview. 
Interview was conducted in English. 
See also PFP83—FBB1020. 
Owing to some recording error of mine, or perhaps to some 
flaw in the tape used for the first reel of the interview, this 
reel 
is virtually unintelligible. 
Voices are very faint, and 
surface noise is 
loud; 
increasing playback volume doesn't really 
help. 
There are sections of the tape where a sentence or a few 
sentences can be understood amid the hiss and hum, but they are 
few and far between. 
Someone with patience might gain some 
benefit from listening to the tape, but it 
is a lot of effort for 
little gain. 
I have decided against making an effort to log 
it, 
after listening through it, 
as there is so 
little that is clear; 
it would be a very sketchy log. 
The remaining reels of this 
interview are quite clear.

Someone turned in a man in this area 
because he had built a new roof on a building without a permit. 
The explanation offered is that nowadays nobody minds their own 
business, and "some people are just crazy." 
Joshua brought in a guitar that Orlando had made for him 
(cut the shape out of a 2x10) and wanted to play and sing for the 
tape, but then changed his mind. 
Orlando made all 
the furniture 
in the living room of this house, and would like someday to start 
his own furniture business, so he won't have to work for anybody. 
He made a lot of things for his mother as well, including a solid 
mahogany coffee table, and some tables for her banana plant. 
The 
banana plant has to stay inside, and it repeatedly grows to 
ceiling height, gets cot down, and sprouts again. 
It can't get 
big enough to bear fruit inside. 
Orlando's uncle works in a 
greenhouse, and gives plants to Orlando's mother, who is "good 
with flowers." 
She has flowers all the way around her house. 
(030) 
Orlando does his woodworking on the front porch of 
their house nowadays. 
Before he had the porch closed in, 
he used 
to do all 
the woodworking upstairs in the bedroom; that's where 
he built all the living room furniture. 
Every day he'd have a 
big mess to clean up -- sawdust. 
He does all his power cutting 
with a hand held power saw; one day he'll get a table saw. 
He 
has quite a few hand power tools. 
He has plans to ask the farmer 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 8 
is he can finish off the inside of an unused garage near the 
house to use 
it for a shop. "I don't want to get rich; I just 
want to have fun." 
(050) 
Explanations of the recording equipment to Joshua. 
Joseph leaves and Hazel warns him to watch out for deer on 
the road as he leaves. 
(069) 
Orlando is the crew foreman on the cranberry harvest. 
The first year he was on the crew, they had a lot of "Spanish 
people" (Hazel's term) on the crew, and Orlando was the only one 
who could speak to them in Spanish. 
The first day they were on 
the job the farmer told the Hispanic crew that he (Orlando) was 
going to be in charge of them. 
These were workers who came over 
from Philly every day. 
A man drove them over each day, 
like 
George (Marquez, see PFP83—RBB001) now does. 
They used to be all 
"Spanish;" 
one day one of the men "went nuts" and lay out in the 
middle of a dam. 
They had to bring him back in 
in a truck, but 
when they put him in the truck, he started throwing things out. 
"They know he was on drugs," Hazel said. 
Someone left the bogs 
to come and get George [Marquez], and the man who was going nuts 
got into another pickup truck and set the seat on fire while he 
was sitting in 
it. 
When they tried to get near him, he smashed 
out all 
the windows with a piece of metal, and tore out all 
the 
wires and the entire interior of the cab. 
He had the doors 
locked so no one could get to him. 
They finally had to call the 
police to come and deal with him, and when the cop asked for his 
ID, 
he "pulled out his umbrella like a sword." 
He never came 
back after that. 
The freak—out began when the crew was out in 
the water, and Orlando was talking to one of the other guys about 
the turkey buzzards that were flying around, when this guy 
started yelling that he wasn't going to kill anybody. 
According 
to Hazel, "they had some real sweeties come up here, I tell you." 
There have been some fierce fights out in the bogs. 
Orlando's 
attitude when a fight begins is to "let 'em fight. 
I'm not going 
to get in their personal business." 
(114) 
Orlando doesn't really like being foreman. 
It's more 
work than 
if he just had to work the harvest all 
day, and he has 
to keep after the men who goof off. 
The worst of 
it 
is that he 
has "half—authority." 
If he had his way about it he'd tell them 
if they weren't going to work to 
leave, but he has no hiring or 
firing capacity. 
All that he can do in that regard is to tell 
the fellow that drives them out from Philly that they don't want 
to work and to find somebody else to bring, but that still only 
amounts to a suggestion. 
(122) 
It as a part of George Marquez's job to bring the 
workers in from Philly. 
It isn't always the same ones; he "just 
picks up whoever's there waiting for him." 
Mostly they are the 
same ones, and some have been coming for years. 
Some of them are 
older men, 
like George, who "works 
in the ring" (where the 
berries are floating at the foot of the elevator) 
is 65 or 66, 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 9 
Sam and Frank are "close to 50." 
These three have been coming to 
work at Birches for 13 years or so. 
(133) 
Orlando used to work at Haines's, on his father's 
crew, off and on. 
Every summer he worked on the blueberries. 
The good thing about working for Thompson (Birches) is that there 
are only cranberries, and after the harvest is over, "everything 
slows down back to normal." 
Cranberry season is a constant rush 
for 6-8 weeks. 
(148) 
Thompson just planted 2 or 3 acres of blueberries 
this year, and Orlando thinks he plans to add to the planting 
each year. 
They can't be harvested for at least 4-5 years after 
they are planted. 
(154) 
The house where Hazel and Orlando live 
is owned by 
Mr. Thompson. 
Orlando makes the improvements to 
it that he and 
Hazel want; "I could just live 
in 
it, but ...that's not my 
style." 
That's why he'd like to have his own house. 
Hazel also 
figures that if you want something done the way you want it, 
you 
have to do 
it yourself, and at any rate they're notplanning on 
moving any time soon. 
(165) 
Orlando feels happy in this house too, but would 
still 
like to own his own house. 
So would Hazel, but "I don't 
want it 
in a town." 
Orlando too wants it "out in the woods with 
no neighbors." 
He feels that if you live in the city, the only 
thing you can do to "escape reality" is "put on the headphones 
and turn on the radio; out here, you can just go outside, listen 
to the birds or the animals, or just walk around." 
Hazel feels 
the woods are nicer for the kids too. 
They lived in Pemberton 
for a while, and "you never saw a tree; you never saw a duck." 
Kidnap too 
is a threat they associate with the city; out here 
"nobody's going to take them." 
Not that there aren't any "nuts" 
out here, but they're "not hanging out on the street corners 
around here." 
(190) 
Hazel has always lived in the woods. 
Orlando lived 
in Glassboro for a year; he went to college there for that year. 
(200) 
Orlando recalls a saying about how a bird leaving its 
nest before its time will always come back; that's how he feels 
about this area. 
Hazel's dad always said that you can take the 
Piney out of the Pines but you can't take the Pine out of the 
Piney. 
"It's true, 
it really is. 
(HT)" 
"(OT) You live out here 
for a while, and you think you want something faster, so you move 
out where there's a lot more action and you get tired of that, so 
you move back." 
When they lived 
in the apartments in Pemberton 
there was always noise and people around every night; people were 
always dropping in. 
Here, nobody drops in without calling 
because it's a long trip to the house, and they don't want to 
come outif there's nobody home. 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 10 
(222) 
This is Hazel's first year working in the 
cranberries. 
Her job lasts only for the duration of the 
harvesting and sorting. 
She got tired of sitting at home, so she 
asked "Chick" for a job and he gave her this one. 
She and Bea 
(Marquez) do the final sorting, getting out all 
the trash that 
the sorting machine misses. 
(236) 
One thing that's nice about living in this area is 
the ease of access to fresh produce. 
When Hazel and Orlando want 
something, they call up Mr. Higginbotham and ask him to bring it 
up. 
One of the men who works at Birches also has his own small 
farm, and his wife does a lot of canning; he often brings stuff 
to the Torreses. 
He also raises chickens and a couple of pigs 
each year. 
He has been working at Birches about 5 years now, 
although he also worked here 30 years ago, and says nothing's 
changed. 
In between, he worked at the correctional colony, 
supervising their farm. 
(264) 
Orlando likes to move into new work when he gets 
tired of one thing. 
After cranberrying wears thin, he'd like to 
do any sort of work with his hands, he'd like to go back to work 
with boats again. 
He worked for Pacemaker Yachts once, 
in Lower 
Bank, and considered that a very good job. 
He started as a 
woodworker, and 
in 7 months he had worked his way up 
into 
training newcomers as to how to install windows. 
When he first 
started, they put him into an empty fiberglas hull, and he was 
supposed to put in the floors, the sides and cabinets, and all 
interior woodwork, as well as preparing the top andsetting that 
on. 
What he 
liked about the place was the opportunity to work 
your way up, which he did; the only thing he didn't do was the 
finishing on the outside fiberglas. 
That's a dirty job, but very 
perfectionistic. 
A woman goes around to inspect with a little 
roll of red tape, and she puts a tape marker on "any little 
scratch she finds", inside and out. 
If that part came through 
your part of the installation, you have to replace it. 
It was on 
their time, but you also had to keep up with the rest of your 
work schedule. 
Orlando feels that that kind of pressure is 
healthy, and makes you want to work. 
"Like any other company" 
they were "too cheap" to implement ideas for improvements if they 
were going to cost them money. 
Orlando thinks you've got to 
spend money to make it. 
The division in Lower Bank, which was a 
half hour from where the Torreses live, went out of business. 
At 
the time he worked there, Orlando lived "around my mom's house" 
(Chatsworth/Hog Wallow); he moved out of his parents' house and 
moved in with a friend just down the street. 
Laterhelived with 
hisbrother for a while, but mostly stayed within the general 
area. 
Birches Road is 
in "the great township of Tabernacle." 
They have lived here for 2 years, and don't really know anybody 
who lives very close. 
All the people they know well 
live far 
away, towards Mount Holly, down toward the shore, these are 
Hazel's relatives. 
(325) 
Hazel's sister lives at the shore, and they often 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 11 
visit. 
They stop at Orlando's "mom's house" on the way down 
there, then spend the weekend at the shore with Hazel's sister, 
then visit Orlando's mother again on the way back. 
They spend a 
lot of time visiting with relatives. 
Hazel finds that "this is a 
good place to get away from, too," even though they're always 
glad to come back to 
it. 
When you stay away for a couple of 
days, you just want to sit down and enjoy being home again when 
you get back, enjoy the quiet. 
They go down to Hazel's sister's 
house on Mystic Island to get some excitement, but are glad to 
get home to the quiet. 
Where she lives, there are "wall to wall 
houses"; she lives close to the water, but not right on the 
lagoon, as she used to. 
Orlando would not like to 
live there the 
year around, because he doesn't like the weather there, "it 
changes too much." 
Around Birches, the weather is "either hot, 
or cold." 
Hazel prefers the cold weather. 
Orlando likes the 
summer because when you knock off work at 3:00 in the afternoon 
there's still a lot of daylight; you can even still go to the 
shore for the late afternoon, since it's only an hour's drive. 
He 
likes to fish at the shore; this 
is his first year ocean 
fishing, though he fished from the docks, and he really liked it. 
Hazel used to go out ocean fishing in boats with her dad all 
the 
time when she was little. 
Orlando has ridden a motorcycle, but 
never a horse or a fishing boat, never so much as a motor boat. 
He would really like to go horseback riding; Hazel says there is 
more to that than he suspects.

TX01: (Continues PFP83—RBB002/003, see also PFP83—FBB1020.) 
(002) 
Orlando's father is "extremely strict", but doesn't 
"get loud" 
like he used to. 
He was very strict with his 
children, and also with his work crew, who used to call him 
Castro, but not to his face. 
One day this summer, there was a 
new kid, who was behind in his assigned task on the crew; 
Orlando's brother went out to help him out, and his dad chewed 
him out. 
He got mad at the crew one day last week, and just 
called them all 
in before the work day was done, and sent them 
all 
home. 
He must have been really disgusted, because it's not 
like him to quit a minute early. 
"He's a real nice guy, 
if you 
do your work." 
Most of his crew speak Spanish. They are not 
residents of the area, but seasonal workers. 
Over there 
(Haines's) they have a 6 month harvest season, because they have 
blueberries and cranberries. 
He has two big buildings where the 
seasonal workers are housed for the whole 6 months; after that 
they either go to a farm that has winter work or they go back to 
Puerto Rico. 
A lot of them have wives in PR, and they go back to 
them for the 6 months in between; Orlando couldn't live like 
that, even though he thinks it might be a good way to make some 
money, since the cost of living is not as high in PR as 
it 
is 
here. 
(039) 
There is a permanent Hispanic population in 
Chatsworth; most work for Haines. 
Orlando's mom and dad live 
there, and all 
their kids, the kids are "still Puerto Ricans" 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 13 
even though they all speak English, and may not speak Spanish. 
Living out in the woods, generational differences don't mean so 
much, especially as the kids get older. 
Orlando's youngest 
brother is 
17 years old. 
"Out here you can see the generations 
grow up and all become one generation later on." 
Living anywhere 
else, you just don't notice them; they seem to "kind of 
leave." 
The population of Orlando's home town was 60 people. 
Hazel comes 
from a family of 7 kids, mostly widely scattered. 
She has 2 
brothers and a sister in Missouri, a sister in Florida. 
They 
don't keep 
in touch with the rest of the family. 
Hazel's sister 
Shirley called up just a few weeks ago, and it was the first time 
she had heard from her in 5 years. 
They fight among themselves a 
lot. 
Orlando thinks maybe it 
is a function of their ages. 
Hazel's oldest sister is nearly 50; 
in Orlando's family, the 
children are just a year apart, so they all 
grew up together. 
By 
the time Hazel was born, only two of her other siblings were 
still at home. 
Orlando's brother who just graduated from high 
school, and doesn't feel 
inclined to go on to any more schooling. 
Orlando feels that when you grow up with older siblings you get 
used to being told what to do all 
the time. 
(109) 
Hazel has Friday off this week, so she can do her 
shopping during the day. 
Usually she goes one evening, and 
Orlando stays home with the kids while she goes; when she goes 
during the day, the kids go with her. 
Hazel thinks Orlando has 
spoiled Amanda (nickname: Willie); he denies it. 
(113) 
This summer after work, Orlando used to take Joshua 
fishing several days a week out in the reservoir behind the 
house. 
Orlando would catch the fish and give them to Joshua to 
throw back. 
They catch Pike and Catfish. 
He used to eat them, 
but now feels that Pike is too much work because it has too many 
small bones. 
He just likes to fish for the fun of 
it. 
The 
Catfish are just about fished out; the ones you can catch now are 
too small. 
"That's from having too many people around." 
Outsiders are not supposed to come in to fish, but they do 
anyway. 
Before, there used to be one or two a year who came 
in 
and you could tell them they were on private property and they 
wouldn't come back. 
"Now there's so many people, you could make 
a living out of chasing them out." 
All you can really do 
is make 
sure that they don't get intothe bogs or ruin anything. 
There 
has been a real 
increase in the number of people coming in the 
last few years. 
You always see tracks of people's having been in 
and out of private roads and lands where "we're the only ones " 
that should be there. 
"There shouldn't be any tracks in there, 
and you see hundreds of tracks 
in there; people everywhere." 
The 
tracks are from trucks, dirt bikes. 
People go right into private 
property to use the land, swim and so on. 
One day they told a 
guy that he was trespassing, and he denied it, even though he was 
sitting right under a "posted" sign. 
Another guy was giving 
people permission to come onto someone else's property. He didn't 
even know the owners; he even built them a footbridge so they 
could cross easily. 
"They're really brave." 
"No respect." 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 14 
(178) 
Things are getting bad around here too with the 
trash, because the dumps are being closed down. The 
environmentalists have a hand in this. 
Now that the dumps are 
being closed, you can drive down any of the back roads and see 
trash that has been dumped by the roadside. 
People just make 
sure there's nothing among the trash with their name on 
it. 
You're not allowed to burn anymore, because of concern for fires 
and pollution. 
"They're making all these laws now, and ... 
the 
only thing it's making it hard for is the people that live here. 
It's nice for the visitors, but if you've got to 
live here all 
year around, you can't, you can't do anything. 
You're almost 
trapped." 
Orlando's fishing in the reservoir behind his house 
is 
not legal because he doesn't have a freshwater license. 
There is 
a reservoir behind his mom's house where he fished every day as a 
kid; now you have to have a license to fish there. 
Hazel doesn't 
really know how the process works by which these laws get passed, 
just, that "they say do 
it, 
and you do 
it." 
There's "nobody, 
really" to complain to 
if you don't like it. 
You still don't 
have to have a permit to go deep—sea fishing for a day, but 
they're trying to change that too; for that, for crabbing, for 
anything you do at the shore. 
(212) 
Before, people used to practice "all sorts of little 
different hobbies" to make extra spending money, but "the way 
things are now, you can't even do that." 
For instance, you could 
make things out of driftwood to sell, but pretty soon somebody 
would come asking 
if you have a permit to sell or if your 
business is 
legal. 
You can do 
it on the side, but "you always 
take a chance on getting caught." 
"Really, 
it's a hobby, you 
only want to make a couple dollars, but ... Uncle Sam wants to 
know everything." 
"The loss of freedom's working its way out of 
the cities now, and everybody's losing it." 
(234) Around here, most of the farmers own large parcels of 
land; Haines owns "thousands and thousands" of acres; after him 
comes DiMarco. 
Almost all of the land is owned by a few farmers, 
so "it's not hard to trespass around here; you're always 
trespassing." 
But when there were fewer people around, they were 
locals and they were known. 
Now, strangers come in, and anybody 
who sees you on their land wants to know who you are. There has 
been a lot of vandalism, too, and people have had their flood 
gated and pumps shot up, and their gates torn down. 
There didn't 
used to be gates on the back roads until the vandalism started, 
and they were put in to keep people out of the land. 
Now you 
can't even take a short cut anywhere any more, because of "other 
people"; you have to go around by the main roads. 
They don't 
know who does it; there are all kinds of people coming in. 
The 
gunning clubs bring in a lot of people. 
The gun clubs are 
located here, but their members come from other places; the gun 
club that Hazel's dad used to guide for was mostly people from 
Princeton. 
A local resident will be the guide, because he knows 
the woods.

(270) 
On the bridge just outside the packing house 
enclosure at Birches Road there were people out fishing all 
summer. 
they would set up with their camping gear and all, and 
expect the people who lived and worked there to go around them. 
They're not even supposed to be there, but they set up there, and 
you have to wait for them to get out of the way when you go by. 
This road 
is Hazel and Orlando's driveway; they worried that if 
they told people, as they were leaving, that they'd better be 
gone when they got back, 
it would be as good as an invitation for 
them to then go check out the house while they were gone. 
There 
has been stuff stolen out of the buildings at Birches, but not 
since they came to 
live here. 
(300) 
Last summer there was some kind of a party out 
nearby, and some kids were shooting off their .22s; they shot up 
the neighbor's mailbox, and when he complained to the police they 
wouldn't do anything about it, even after they caught the kid 
with the .22, because there was no actual witness to the 
shooting. 
Orlando target shoots around here, but they use a big 
pile of waste cranberry leaves to back up the targets, and the 
shells are spent in the pile. 
(319) 
Orlando thinks the cranberry farms will always be 
around. 
There would have to be an influx of "millions of people" 
to build up enough to jeopardize the cranberry farm, and the 
building moratorium "does away with that." 
In Chatsworth, there 
was a big development planned, and the roads were already being 
dug at the time the moratorium was started. 
Hazel feels that it 
really won't stop them, 
if they have enough money; there's a big 
development off of Tabernacle Road that went in 
last year. 
She 
figures if you have enough money and know the right people you 
can get permission to built. 
"It's who you know." 
Before, you 
weren't affected by these considerations; if you needed to build 
a barn, you didn't have to ask; "not now." 
The current farmers 
got their farms down through the families; Hazel said that at one 
time recently, the farmers had to get permits to dig new bogs on 
their own land — she doesn't know if that's still 
in effect. 
Orlando figures it's to keep people from clearing all 
of their 
land at once to put it 
into crops; "back to the tree frog." 
(365) 
Hazel guesses there must really be something to this 
tree frog business. 
Once a few years ago, when she was married 
to her other husband, a fellow came down from the Bronx Zoo to 
catch two tree frogs. 
One of them wouldn't eat when they got it 
back to the Zoo, so he came all the way back here to 
let it go, 
so 
it wouldn't die. 
The frogs are really pretty; there emerald 
green, with an iridescent purple stripe down the side. 
They are 
less than an inch long. 
They come out in the spring. 
They are 
an endangered species, so 
laws have been made to try to save 
them. 
At the same time, "the state's trying to put rattlesnakes 
out." 
Once they let bears out in this area; "so many sets of 
brown bears." 
Hazel swears she saw one of them on her farm, but 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 16 
nobody believes her. 
They have also released wild turkeys, and 
Orlando sees them around and thinks they are "populating." 
The 
original turkey population had been "shot out." 
There are 
rattlesnakes around here already, enough, 
in Hazel's opinion, 
that they don't need to put out any more.

(000) 
Around here almost everyone is related, at least 
distantly, to everyone else; they're "some sort of cousin." 
You 
use the criterion 
"they ain't got my last name" to decide who's 
not really family any more. 
(011) 
"People out here are really strange." 
Orlando was 
telling me the other day about how people are afraid to talk to 
strangers; they're afraid "Uncle Sam's gonna come down and 
investigate their whole lives." 
His attitude is "let 'em come do 
it. 
... I don't own anything that they can't have." 
The old 
timers are really starange. 
They're used to doing things their 
own way, and you can't tell them any different. 
Small farmers 
are finding it's almost not worth it to grow stuff any more 
because of the taxes. 
There are investigations made, though 
"they try to be sneaky about it; I guess that's what makes the 
old timers around here paranoid." 
Hazel says they may be afraid 
of revenuers; there's no telling what they're doing around here. 
Orlando doesn't understand the fear of the government; he thinks 
"there's nobody in government any different than I am." 
(039) 
A few years ago there was a TV documentary on the 
Pines, which portrayed a very bad image. 
They made it 
look "like 
the people were living in caves." 
They try to make it 
look like 
"we're way outof civilization; there's nothing out there." 
Orlando would like to get on TV and voice his opinion on how the 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 18 
country's run. 
He reckons there would be at least 5 million 
people who would agree with him. 
"Not even 1% of the 
population's running the whole world; and that don't seem right 
to me." 
The idea of coming here in the first place, says Hazel, 
was to get away from opression in England, and now "they're right 
back into it." 
(062) 
Once at Orlando's mother's house, a niece of Hazel's 
overheard Orlando and his mother speaking Spanish, and asked 
Hazel why they were "talking Chinese." 
Orlando got a kick out of 
that. 
Orlando finds it handy that people often don't "know my 
race;" he can eavesdrop on conversations, including conversations 
about himself, and then announce just as he 
is 
leaving that he 
understood it all. 
It works both with people speaking English in 
front of him, and Spanish. 
He has a "thing" for mind control, 
and he used to practice at it for a while. 
(085) 
Orlando is also very outspoken, and usually tells 
people right to their face just what he thinks of them. 
Hazel 
feels that that is "ignorant," but Orlando feels that as long as 
he's telling the truth, 
it doesn't matter. 
He does acknowledge 
that it doesn't always make him too popular. 
That phase 
coincided with their living in town; now that they're back out in 
the woods, he's "mellow again. 
I'm not loud like I was." 
Hazel 
thinks that "that place does it to you. 
You gotta do something. 
You got to. 
Drive you crazy if you don't." 
(105) 
Hazel generally gets up at 5:30 every morning. 
She 
gets the kids ready and takes them to the babysitter before the 
workday begins.

G—Vineland; 33GT Tape begins in the middle of a 
conversation about the starting up of the Fire Aid Society. 
Many 
of the people who lost their homes in the fire also lost their 
savings, because they didn't have bank accounts but kept cash in 
the house in a box or in the mattress and it was burned up. 
The 
owner of the store 
in which the fire had started helped to 
organize the first fund drive; he had insurance coverage, but 
none of the people who were left homeless did. 
The Fire Aid 
Society, besides helping fire victims financially, tries to 
educate the public to fire safety, tenant's insurance, and so on. 
The store owner no 
longer lives in Vineland; he returned to 
Puerto Rico  after the fire.

•Ivan explains the anglicized pronunciation of his name. 
Most Anglos say Arcaya with a long A in the medial position, 
though in Spanish that A is pronounced of 
if 
it were the English 
Iong I. 
Interruption: 
Sonny Lugo sent word to our table that I was 
to come up and address the crowd and introduce myself. 
Most of the Puerto Rican settlers in the Vineland area came 
from the town of Utuado, a small town 
in the interior of Puerto 
Rico. 
Most of them were farm workers or small farm owners in 
P.R. 
When Puerto Rico was industrialized "overnight, by the 
American occupational forces, these people were displaced, 
basically." 
Operation Bootstrap, conducted by the joint effort 
of the US government and the government of Puerto Rico, promoted 
the industrialization which radically altered the principally 
agrarian economy. 
Displaced farmers and agricultural workers 
migrated to the US where they could still pursue their familiar 
employment. 
The governments of the US and Puerto Rico formed an 
organization which transported displaced Puerto Ricans to the US 
for farm employment, "and that's how the people here 
in Vineland 
came to be here." 
"All the people here ... are either 
farmworkers, or descendents of farmworkers." 
"And basically from 
the same area. (...) 
if you include the other towns, 
like Utuado, 
Jayuya, then it's probably" an area of about 100 miles radius. 
But the majority are from "one exact town", the town of Utuado, 
some 75 to 90 percent. 
The others are from the interior of 
Puerto Rico as well, but from other small towns. 
There is still a good deal of travel between the mainland 
and the island, since people still have relatives in Puerto Rico. 
The three major Hispanic groups in the US are Mexicans, Cubans, 
and Puerto Ricans. 
The Puerto Ricans retain their culture "the 
most" because they have "dual citizenship," in the US and 
in 
Puerto Rico. 
"Even though Puerto Rico's not considered a nation, 
they consider themselves citizens of Puerto Rico. 
And they also 
consider themselves citizens of the United States." 
(Background: 
auction of a prize donated by a local 
business.) 
(075) 
When people get back to Puerto Rico for a visit, they 
"immerse themselves" 
in the culture of the island; they speak 
only Spanish, they don't listen to English language radio. 
They 
become reLatinized, and often have trouble adapting to the U.S. 
when they come back again. 
They have culture shock, "even if 
they're there for only, 
let's say, a month, they're just on 
vacation." 
Return to the US after a visit to Puerto Rico 
is 
almost unreal. 
Puerto Rico is a commonwealth, so " it's sort of 
like a political creation" which is neither a nation nor a state; 
"and this political creation either accidentally or on purpose 
has helped the Puerto Ricans maintain their culture." 
Their 
politics are Latin, as 
is the social 
life; 
"everything's Latin 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 21 
except their economy", which is Americanized. 
Socially, 
culturally, and politically, Puerto Rico is Latin, but 
economically, 
it 
is American. 
(036) The most recent census shows about 
13,000 Puerto 
Ricans in Cumberland County, of which Vineland is the largest 
city. 
Local Hispanic community leaders estimate the number is 
closer to 20,000. 
Arcaya figures it's about 15,000, and that the 
census figures are conservative while the leadership figures are 
liberal. 
Unity in the community follows the Puerto Rican 
pattern. 
In the island there is a close identity with one's 
native town, mores o than with Puerto Rico; regionalism is 
stronger than nationalism there, and towns are felt to be unique. 
That carries over here, where people still 
identify more with the 
town that they come from in Puerto Rico, "unless there is 
something that threatens them as a group" and then they identify 
with Puerto Rico, or with Hispanic culture as a whole, "for 
solidarity purposes." 
(025) 
Only part of Vineland is within the Pinelands 
Reserve. 
Building regulations have not really affected the 
Puerto Rican community here, because the Hispanics live 
in the 
center city area, and it 
is not within the bounds of the Reserve. 
In the Eastern portion of the city, which is within the bounds of 
the Reserve, a few very successful Hispanic professionals do 
live, but the majority of the comunity is unaffected. 
(138) 
There are sports clubs which go by the name of Puerto 
Rican home towns, especially softball teams, or small 
organizations. 
There is some problem with this since most of the 
people are from only one or two towns, so that theoretically 
there could be a number of teams named "Utuado", and not many 
people available to join teams named after other locales. 
As a 
consequence, more team names, and hence more sense of 
identity, 
are being attached to the island itself, and to more 
nationalistic themes, or more "neutral names" such as "Club 
Borinquen", or "Roberto Clemente" (named after a famous Puerto 
Rican baseball player). 
About 10 years ago, 
identification with 
the towns was stornger in these matters; nowadays it 
leans more 
toward identification with the island as a whole, and with well 
known figures, alive and dead. 
In Vineland there is the Social 
Action Club, the Club Borinquen, and the Liga de Domino as main 
organizations; most people belong to one or another of the clubs 
(Domino League membership overlaps both, apparently). 
Other 
organizations spring up temporarily to meet a certain need or 
other. 
The clubs serve a places to speak Spanish together, "to 
eat their own food, hear their own music, drink their own 
drinks." 
(180) There are musical groups in Vineland, and many 
musically talented people. 
There are no professional groups that 
Arcaya knows of, though there are groups "that should be 
professional." 
They don't really have formal memberships or 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 22 
names, but different aggregates of musicians get together under a 
variety of names to play. 
(Arcaya will forward some referrals to 
me. ) 
Arcaya himself is from the city, and verifies that the 
musical tastes are different in the cities of Puerto Rico (which 
are 
in the coastal areas) than 
in the interior. 
The cities have 
more of an Afro—Caribbean flavor, the kind of music Arcaya 
himself grew up with. 
Most of the music of the interior is 
"jibaro". 
This area is now changing because of the high 
percentage of young people in Vineland's Hispanic community; they 
prefer rock music, though at one tiume they were into the Afro— 
Caribbean music, which became popular when there was an 
influx of 
Puerto Ricans into Vineland from New York and Philadelphia; they 
brought the music with them. 
The older people still retain the 
"jibaro" music, the "musica tipica puertorriquena". 
The music 
that is 
in the background of this tape he refers to as "first 
generation Puerto Rican—American music", very rock—and—roll, very 
Americanized. 
The music is associated with the Puerto Rican 
group Menudo, and doesn't necessarily have a name particular to 
the style. 
It mixes Spanish lyrics with American Rock music; 
there are no African of Jibaro musical features in 
it. 
Salsa was 
basically the Afro—Caribbean music mixed up with a lot of jazz 
and a little bit of the "tipica" music (Arcaya refers to the 
"jibaro" music as "tipica," typical or traditional.) 
Salsa was 
also at one time the big thing among the younger people; the 
older people basically have always retained the "tipica" music. 
The young people are willing to experiment. They have been 
through fads of Salsa, Disco, and now Menudo. 
(240) 
The older people are fearful that the younger people 
are losing a grip on their culture; their musical taste adds to 
this fear. 
But the promoters who have created Menudo have been 
shrewd in retaining the Spanish language and 
in selecting 
membership who represent the range of skin colors found in Puerto 
Rico, dark, light, "sort of 
like mixed looking ones; triguenos" 
(wheat colored), and white. 
The group Menudo is a creation of 
the promoters, who are trying to tap the market of the more 
Americanized young Puerto Ricans in the US, who are likely to be 
more affluent. 
"There's some...socioeconomic class involved 
in 
this also;" it mainly functions in Puerto Rico. 
Here in the US 
most of the Puerto Ricans are working class, or poor; there is a 
small group of middle class professionals, or children of 
professionals. 
"But the majority of the Puerto Ricans are still 
porr and working poor, and they tend to retain the "tipica 
puertorriquena" music, and also the Salsa." 
(Menudo) 
is 
basically a middle class phenomenon created in Puerto Rico and 
transported to the mainland. 
(276) 
Most people still retain their Hispanic foods at 
occasions, though it 
is mostly the older people who still keep it 
in their homes as wel, older people, and the people who were born 
and raised "in the island" and then came here later. 
"It's a 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 23 
combination of...cultural and educational; because even the 
successful businessmen who have the money will still buy the rice 
and beans." 
Professionals, many of whom were raised in the US, 
mix their foods quite a bit. 
"Those who are educated and raised 
here, regardless of their income, will be more...like a 
hyphenated—Americans, mix both foods. 
Those who are raised over 
there, 
in the island, even if they became affluent here will 
still retain mostly the Puerto Rican food from the island, 
la 
comida criolla, arroz y habichuela, rice and beans, that type of 
thing." 
People make a point of having the traditional foods at 
festivals. 
(297) Every summer in Vineland they have El Festival 
Puertorriqueno, a week of cultural events, including typical 
music, a parade with "folklorical type of dresses,...folklorical 
music," skits dealing with religious and folk traditions. 
"The 
entire week is dedicated basically to Puerto Rican folklore and 
Puerto Rican culture, Puerto Rican history;" to remind people of 
their culture, and to show the community at large "that there is 
another side to the Puerto Rican other than just his language," 
i. 
e., that Puerto Ricans have culture, literature, 
folklore,painters, poets, clothing, customs. 
(320) Parents make a certain effort to teach their children 
the traditions, and succeed up to a point, "until the children 
leave." 
Once the children leave home for college, or leave the 
area and go somewhere else for a job, "then you will see a change 
when they come back." 
They become Anglicized, and become "more 
hyphenated—Americans." 
"Education seems to change the Puerto 
Ricans in the area, and also working in other parts of the 
country" where there are not so many Hispanics. 
(339) 
In Vineland the Hispanics are "very community 
oriented" and so they tend to mingle among themselves; the more 
educated ones mingle more in the Anglo community and the Black 
community. 
There 
is not too much communication among the Hispanic 
communities in South Jersey (e.g., Hammonton, Vineland, 
Woodbine). 
People in each New Jersey town tend to be from a 
different locale in Puerto Rico, and the pattern of native town 
identity still operates here 
in the US; 
if 
"they don't have their 
towns 
in common... basically they don't know each other." 
They 
know each other as Puerto Ricans but not as "my neighbor Juan; 
they're not vecinos (neighbors). 
"Here in Utuado... I mean here 
in Puerto Rico ... see, here I go again. 
This community is so 
Puerto Ricanized, I guess, that I even forget that I'm, 
sometimes...in the United States." 
(364) (Introductions from some Anglo politicians who stopped 
in; background cheering for a raffle winner.) 
Prize donations 
are made to the Fire Aid Society are mostly made by the Hispanic 
owned businesses, as an incentive to prospective money donors to 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 24 
pledge. 
The Maraton is a fairly unique event in Anglo—Hispanic 
cooperation. 
(Arcaya left for a moment to quiet a drunk; 
background music is for a belly dancer who dances for one of the 
donors to the fund raiser.)

(000) 
G—Vineland; 33GT Arcaya apologizing for the drunken man 
who had interrupted us. 
There are Hispanic owned businesses in 
Vineland, of which the majority are grocery stores. 
They 
basically sell typical Puerto Rican foods, and cater only to the 
Hispanic community. 
There are also service businesses, such as 
garages, which appeal to "all groups" 
in town.Bodegas sell food 
and herbal healing items, and there are a few in town. 
The ones 
Arcaya was talking about, though, are more specifically 
groceries, and they make up the majority of the Hispanic owned 
businesses. 
There is also a change happening in this area, more 
Hispanic doctors, lawyers, real estate people, business 
consultants, accountants, tax experts. 
Depending on the 
generation, Hispanics who become economically successful relate 
more or less to the community from which they came. 
The older 
generations tend to bear the community in mind, and remain active 
in 
it after their successes, while the younger people don't. 
Even the very affluent older ones retain their links with their 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 26 
group, and "maintain a very down—to—earth...the jibaro culture; 
the jibaro culture is a very down—to—earth culture where people 
are all 
treated as equals..."Arcaya finds it remarkable and 
"unique" that the affluent members of the community keep up their 
culture, and don't just start going to the ballet. 
The more 
educated members tend to mingle more with the Anglos, and "belong 
to the Kiwanis, or the Jaycees." 
(050) 
The majority of the Hispanic community in Vineland is 
Catholic, "and the rest are, I would say, Penetecostal." 
In the 
Catholic church, the Cursillistas and the Carismaticos 
(charismatics) are very popular, and most of the Catholic 
Hispanics belong to one of these groups. 
The Carismaticos are 
more like born again Christians, and the Cursillistas are more 
fundamentalist. 
The church is accepting of both groups. 
The 
Pentecostals are an evangelical group. 
The biggest "patron" of 
the Puerto Rican community is the Virgin Mary; she 
is more the 
symbol of the Puerto Ricans, 
while the Mexican—Americans are 
given to the devotions to patron saints, the Puerto Ricans are 
devoted to the Virgin. 
They used to observe a number of saints 
as well, but the church "came down hard...on the patron saints, 
so they gave that up.. But they refused to give up their loyalty 
to the Virgen. 
That is one thing that the church will never be 
able to eliminate. 
They more or less compromised. 
We won't be 
so hooked on the potron saints, but there's no way we're gonna 
give up on the Virgen." 
La Virgen de Fatima is very popular in 
South Jersey, "and they will never give that up." 
In Vineland, 
the church tries not to stress the saints or the Virgin, so there 
are few processions in their honor. 
People observe them 
privately, and "maybe when the priest is gonna come for a visit, 
you put her back into the background a little bit." 
The priests 
are trying to stress Christ and the Trinity, "whereas the Puerto 
Ricans still are very attached to their Virgin Mary." 
In the 
cities, "they are much more open about the Virgin Mary," because 
they are more liberal; they come from different parts of the 
island. 
In Vineland, the Puerto Ricans are more conservative. 
(101) 
They are politically conservative, too, and Arcaya 
feels that is unique to this area. 
There are many Republican 
supporters among the Hispanics in this area. 
Typically, Puerto 
Ricans are associated with the Democratic party in Puerto Rico, 
and so associate themselves with the Democratic party in the US; 
however they have begun to realize that the Democratic party of 
the island 
is more conservative. 
As a result, 
in Vineland they 
feel that the Republican party is more attuned to the Puerto 
Rican Democratic party. 
In Puerto Rico, the Democratic party is 
conservative, "it's the Commonwealth party. 
The liberal party in 
Puerto Rico is actually the Independence Party." 
The majority of 
the Puerto Ricans do not associate with the Independence party. 
In the rural areas in the US now, Puerto Ricans are beginning to 
be drawn to the Republican party, though in the cities they still 
stick with the Democrats. 
Arcaya feels that this 
is part of the 
"uniqueness" of the Hispanic culture in the South Jersey area, 
and that many politicians, especially in the urban centers are 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 27 
unaware of the Hispanic "political awakening." 
There will 
be 
Puerto Rican candidates running for both parties in the area in 
'84; this will be the first time there have been Hispanic 
candidates at all, and they will 
be represented on both sides; 
another thing that is unique to this area. 
Arcaya feels it will 
be divisive of the Hispanic community to have this party split. 
Businesspeople and working people will be likely to vote 
Republican, while the poor will vote Democratic, "even if the 
Republican candidate is better." 
There will be a class, rather 
than an ethnic division in this election. 
Arcaya again stresses 
"the uniqueness of the rural Puerto Ricans to the urban." 
There 
has been ongoing organizing for voter registration, and the 
turnout should be good 
in 
'84. 
The major newspapers, which are 
in urban centers, are likely to miss the real story — the 
Republican vote of rural Puerto Ricans. 
Arcaya feels that the 
rural areas are more interesting, and they fluctuate more than 
the urban. (Background radio announcer's noise particularly loud 
here.) 
(160) 
Concluding remarks. 
Again stresses "we do have a 
unique culture, a rural culture, 
in the South Jersey area; and 
it 
is not being publicized." 
"The urban Puerto Ricans are more 
Hyphenated—Americans" than the rural ones; their culture is truly 
unique and has not been documented, which Arcaya feels is a great 
shame.

Enrique Rodriguez 
TX01: G—Woodbine; 37GT (See also PFP83—FBB1109. 
Beginning of 
interview was conducted in English; because Mr. Rodriguez seemed 
so uncomfortable, and I thought that language might be a factor, 
we switched to Spanish early on, and finished the interview in 
Spanish. In fact, 
language had nothing to do with Mr. Rodriguez's 
discomfort; he was just feeling embarrassed and on the spot, I 
think. 
All quotes appear in the language in which they were 
spoken.) 
(000) 
It 
is common to use English nicknames for Hispanic 
given names. 
Rodriguez goes by "Ricky" (though I noticed that 
people who addressed him in Spanish pronounced it "Rique", so 
it's hard to tell 
if they're using the English nickname or the 
Spanish one). 
Also, many people will use Spanish nicknames, 
which may or may not have anything to do with their given names. 
Rodriguez' brother Angel goes by "Chiwi", just a made up name. 
In the community, no one calls him by his given name, just by 
"Ch iwi." 
(033) 
the Hispanic community in Woodbine numbers 
between 400 and 500, 
in Rodriguez' estimation. 
It 
is a fairly 
stable, permanent community. 
Many Hispanics have lived there 
alnost 30 years; Rodriguez has lived there 27 years. 
Immigration 
to this area began in about 1951. 
When Rodriguez came to the US, 
he was first in Tuckahoe. 
Many people came to work in farms in 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 29 
the nearby area, as 
in Cedarville. 
Also, many people came 
directly to Woodbine and worked in the factories, of which there 
were several at that time. 
Two of them were situated right 
across the road from where the Ambulance Company now is, on 
DeHirsch Avenue; 
these were clothing factories. 
A third factory 
which made clothing at that time 
is now a candle factory for the 
Wheaton company. 
There was a hat factory as well as a general 
clothing factory, and one which made rubber goods. 
"There was a 
lot of industry at that time." 
The factories moved out of town, 
bit by bit, though Rodrtiguez doesn't really have an 
idea why. 
They began to move out of state, 
if they didn't go out of 
business; 
it started around '67 or '68. 
Many people, "quite a 
few," were affected by the moves, but most of them are now 
employed in the Woodbine Development Center, for the handicapped; 
it 
is the former State School, whose name has now been changed. 
Most of the Hispanic population in Woodbine work there. 
(078) Many Hispanics in Woodbine own their own houses. 
(Switch to Spanish.) 
One of the strongest points of the Woodbine 
Hispanic community is that they are very very unified. 
The 
identity is strong with Puerto Rico. 
In Woodbine, the Puerto 
Ricans have come from various parts of Puerto Rico, coastal and 
interior; they are from several towns. 
Rodriguez is from the 
interior, from Cayey. 
Identity is also strong with one's home 
town in Puerto Rico. 
Some people go back and forth to Puerto Rico fairly 
frequently, but Rodriguez last went there 13 years ago. 
Last 
month, however, a family member of his died, so he went there for 
a week; but it was the first visit in 
13 years. 
Most of his 
family are 
in the US, 
in Woodbine and 
in the environs. 
His 
brother lives 
in Millville, but he used to 
live 
in Woodbine, and 
owned a house there; he came there first, and lived there some 
15-18 years. 
(115) In Woodbine people are conscious of keeping up the 
Hispanic traditions. 
There is a small group who have gotten 
together to begin to form a club, and they get together regularly 
to play dominoes. 
They are just beginning a club; they have 
rented a building temporarily, until they can begin to get 
together a building [of their own]. 
There was another club, back 
in 
'67, but it gradually petered out, and no one has tried to put 
together another one until to now, but the effort is underway. 
"Tambien nos dedicamos tambien en el verano en el 
sofbol y eso." 
(There is great enthusiasm for softball 
in the summer.) 
The 
league they play in 
is the Vineland league; the Woodbine teams go 
there, and the Vineland teams come to Woodbine to compete. 
There 
is one team only in Woodbine, two 
in Vineland, and one 
in 
Landisville who are 
in the league. 
Hammonton used to be in the 
league, which was originally between Hammonton, Woodbine, and 
Vineland. 
Hammonton fell off gradually though, and then the rest 
of Hammonton got together with Landisville to make one team. 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 30 
(145) "En los tiempos de ante" (before; at one time) there 
were good parrandas (caroling outings) at Christmastime, but 
things are changing now; they still do them some. 
Parents do 
make an effort to teach the traditions to their children. 
Rodriguez and his wife have made a special effort to teach their 
two boys, both born in the US, to speak Spanish. 
They keep up 
the comida criolla, "siempre" (always). 
Ingredients can be 
purchased in Woodbine to a certain extent. 
There is one Hispanic 
store there, but most people go to Vineland to buy the goods. 
There is quite a bit of commerce and contact between Woodbine and 
Vineland, and more recently with Millville as well. 
The 
community in Woodbine has always been about the same size, 
roughly 500. 
(174) 
There is a Spanish language mass in the church in 
Woodbine, St. Casimir's. 
The Cursillo is active in the church 
there. 
It 
is a personal, experiential kind of retreat, which 
supposedly one has only once in a lifetime, and tries to maintain 
a lifestyle which reflects it thereafter. 
People who have had 
the experience get together in meetings to discuss it among 
themselves, and these are the cursillistas. 
There is also the 
experiential time after, called the ultreya; and lately people 
have begun a movement called la renovacion in which one can 
basically re—experience, or renew, the cursillo. 
The 
cursillistas of the entire Diocese of Camden (Camden, Vineland, 
Hammonton, Atlantic City, Woodbine, Milleville, Bridgeton) keep 
in touch with one another, and get together for meetings and 
reunions, for example each month there is Una hora con Cristo 
("an hour with Christ"), and every year there is an Ultreya 
meeting "para mantener el movimiento asi adelante" (to keep the 
movement going forward). 
The movement is based both in the 
church and 
in the community. 
Anglos are 
in the Cursillo movement 
in some places, e.g., 
in the Villas, the nearest one to Woodbine, 
but not in Woodbine proper. 
In the prison nearby there is also a 
group who goes there to give the Cursillo and there many 
Americans are members. 
The Anglo and Hispanic communities do 
come together in th Cursillo. 
(230) Although the Hispanics in Woodbine are very dedicated 
to maintaining their Hispanic identity, there is also very close 
contact and free interchange between the Anglo and Hispanic 
communities. 
But the sense of Hispanic identity "es una cosa que 
uno se mantiene" (is a thing that one maintains). 
(235) In Woodbine there are no musical groups playing 
traditional Puerto Rican music. 
In other times, when they still 
had the club and had dances and parties, they hired groups in 
from Philadelphia and New York to play, dance bands, who played 
Salsa and other dance musics. 
Jibaro music uses guitars and the 
cuatro, and has special songs; 
it 
is more for the special 
occasions, and for the parrandas and other such things. 
The 
dance bands don't play anything like that. 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 31 
(253) Some time back, they used to reenact the Passion of 
Christ at Eastertime, going 
in procession through the streets, 
but now they just have a smaller version, around the block the 
church is on. 
They do 
it on Good Friday. 
Before, they used to 
go through almost half the town. 
It has fallen off quite a bit, 
and people don't participate like they used to, just as they 
don't keep up their weekly attendance at church. 
About 70% of 
the Puerto Rican community is Catholic. 
Many people now have to 
work on Sundays, since they work at the Development Center, and 
may have a Weekend shift, and this affects church attendance 
adversely. 
(272) 
Many people from Woodbine also work 
in Atlantic City, 
which is about 45 minutes from Woodbine. 
People begin to 
identify more with Atlantic City when they work there. 
It has 
been about 4 years since there was an active club in Woodbine, so 
Rodriguez can't really say whether many people would prefer to go 
to Atlantic City for their entertainments if there were a club in 
Woodbine. 
Many people do go to Vineland to dance at the Club 
there, at the Social Action Club. 
(300) 
Radio from the ambulance. They have arrrived at the 
hospital. 
Rodriguez had been working with the volunteer 
ambulance service for 12 years. 
"El padre" (his father? the 
priest?) has three years on him at that. He has been with the 
service 15 years, and has just retired; he 
is the "primers 
persona de salud" 
(the first or primary person in Health). 
He 
was with them for 15 years. (It is the priest.) 
He has retired 
now. 
Rodriguez himself hurt his back in the aambulance, and can 
no 
longer go out with them on trips. 
He stays on as an active 
member of the corps, and 
in fact is their president. 
The company 
is voluntary, but they do provide worker's compensation; at one 
time the insurances had to be paid for by the members themselves, 
but now they are paid by the town. 
Rodriguez goes to therapy for 
his back three times a week; the clinic is near Atlantic City, 
in 
Pomona. 
His back 
is getting better little by 
little. 
(337) 
The economic situation is difficult for Puerto Ricans 
in Woodbine, just as 
it 
is 
in bigger cities. 
There is 
unemployment, and a problem of very small housing for large 
families. 
The government of Woodbine is by mayor and city 
council, and they are responsive to the needs of the Hispanic 
community and help out some. 
(372) 
The Hispanic community has changed, from earlier 
times; "ha decaido un poco" (it has declined somewhat). 
Before, 
there was more work and prosperity, and more activity. 
(380) 
There is no Puerto Rican parade in Woodbine, but many 
poeople do go to Vineland for the Hispanic festival and parade 
there the last week in July. 
There is much communication between 
Woodbine and Vineland, but not too much with Hammonton.

Woodbine has been affected by the Pinelands laws, but 
Rodriguez refers me to someone else to discuss that, who is more 
involved in such matters.

Interview 
conducted in Spanish, with occasional phrases in English. 
All 
quotes appear in the language in which they were spoken.) 
(000) G—Woodbine; 39GT Discussion of the ambulance crew and 
the assignment they were out on, following radio communication 
from them while the tape was being changed. 
Resume talk of the Pinelands Reserve laws and if/how they 
have affected the Hispanic community in Woodbine: 
in particular 
it makes it difficult for people to be able to build, and getting 
permits has become very complicated. 
There are national park 
lands 
in the Woodbine area, but Rodriguez has not noticed that 
there have been any particular changes in their use lately; there 
is a lake there, and 
it has always gotten a lot of use. 
Again E. 
Rodriguez refers to another man whom he says could give me 
information about the subject, a Jose Rodriguez (no relation). 
(039) 
E. Rodriguez's sister in 
law (Jeannette Irizarry) 
works on the ambulance crew, and she also could be of help in 
talking about community life 
in Woodbine, and how it has changed 
in 
recent years. 
(At the time of the interview, she was out on a 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 34 
call with the ambulance crew.) 
This was not the woman I met the 
last time I was 
in Woodbine (see PFP83—FBB1013); that was 
Rodriguez' sister, Nati Rodriguez. 
Nati 
is short for Natividad. 
E. Rodriguez had spelled Irizarry's last name for me, and had to 
correct it; he 
is not used to spelling in Spanish (many Puerto 
Ricans in the US, though they speak primarily Spanish, spell 
things out in the English alphabet, and are not comfortable or 
fluent with spelling in Spanish). 
(Pause in tape, while E. Rodriguez called J. Rodriguez to 
ask him to join us.) 
TX02: WHAT FOLLOWS IN INTERVIEW WITH JOSE RODRIGUEZ: 
(064) 
Jose Rodriguez joined us. 
He is a councilman in Woodbine, 
and has lived 
in Woodbine for about 35 years. 
He was 15 or 16 
years old when he came here; E. Rodriguez was 12 or 13. 
J. 
Rodriguez thinks that, during the time that he has been 
councilman, he has seen many problems, "No se ha visto ningun 
cambio; al 
contrario, problemas" (There haven't been changes, but 
rather problems), as a result of the new Pinelands laws. 
Especially, there is a problem with people not being allowed to 
put up any new building, unless they meet stringent requirements. 
They must have 5 acres outside of the town, and one acre inside 
the town, 
in order to build. 
There are people who would build 
but they don't have the land. 
There are also times when the 
initial ok 
is given, but then after 5 or 6 months of running 
around looking for all the necessary permissions, they are 
eventually denied permission. 
This is, 
he feels, a problem of 
the regulations of the State and the "Pinelands"; people who live 
in Woodbine must also go as far as Camden or Trenton sometimes to 
deal with their paperwork, though it can be done by telephone and 
mail. 
People are getting permits, but it 
is complicated. 
In 
general, 
in this area, people are allowed to make adjustments to 
existing buildings, anything that has been built in the past 20 
years; but new building is badly affected. 
Some people 
in 
Woodbine have been building a new house recently, but they had to 
run around for 3 or 4 months to get their permits. 
The costs are 
also very high, and that is also the fault of "la Pineland," 
mostly in that the minimum land requirements are now so high for 
obtaining a permit, that any sort of proposed building budget is 
automatically increased by the cost of the minimum amount of 
land 
(5 acres). 
The other problem is that there are an increasing number of 
sites that are vacant and available within the town center, on 
some of the main streets, and people won't buy them, because they 
don't meet the land minimum, and prospective buyers know that 
they will just be hampered later in any efforts to build there. 
The former building lot requirements in town were 75' x 150', but 
now people aren't allowed to build on those lots. 
There are many 
sites in the very center of town, which no one dares to buy. 
The 
center of town 
is being abandoned little by 
little. 
Here 
in the 
small town, they are having the problem of the larger urban 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 35 
areas, that the center of town becomes empty, "y nunca se replace 
(last word in English)" (it never gets replaced). 
The problem 
cannot necessarily be solved by purchasing lots together, because 
they aren't always available contiguously. 
(121) 
Since "el Pineland" has been registering all 
land 
uses in South Jersey, there have been problems, but J. Rodriguez 
feels that the southern area has been the most affected. 
The 
reason for this 
is the concern with the water conservation 
programs. 
Anywhere that there is or has been water there are 
strict refgulations; there is not much wetland or woodland in the 
north. 
In the south there are manmy acres of 
land which also 
have water, and "el Pineland to coge" (the Pineland takes it). 
The government wants to have control of all 
sites where there is 
water replenishment, interior and near the ocean. 
Near the 
lakes, where people used to be able to fill 
low land and build 
houses, they now longer can; they have to ask "el Pineland", 
which doesn't want to give any permissions for building where 
water is or has been in the past. 
Even if a spot is now dry, but 
is marked on the map as a place where water has been in the past, 
it comes under their control. 
The problem in Woodbine is not so 
much one of the wetlands, but of the building lots being too 
small to obtain permits. 
(170) In Vineland, there is not enough unity in the Hispanic 
community to get a Hispanic representative in the city council, 
or to organize people to vote. 
In Vineland, they have the bad 
reputation of being very self—seeking, and feeling that if 
someone is seeking a position of leadership, they are trying to 
advance themselves, not that they are trying to help the 
community at large. 
There, people 
in general are not dedicated 
to the community at large, and they don't like to work for free. 
In all community organizing, when there is so much work to be 
done, there is a lot which must be done voluntarily. 
"Uno no 
necesita tener pago para todas esas cosas" (One doesn't need to 
be paid for all these things). 
There, though, they want to be 
paid for every effort. 
(207) In Woodbine the community is small, but very unified: 
JR: 
Somos pocos, pero siempre ha estado... 
ER: 
...siempre unido. 
(We are few, but it has always been, 
always united.) 
Much of the community work is voluntary.

TX01: (Interview was conducted in the living room of the home of 
Adelio Garcia and Selina Aides. 
Adelio 
is Puerto Rican and 
speaks heavily accented English; Selina is an American Black 
woman, who speaks no Spanish. 
The interview was conducted 
primarily in Spanish, except when questions from me or 
explanations from Adelio were addressed to Selina. 
All quotes 
appear in the language in which they were spoken. 
See also 
PFP83—FBB1110a.) 
(008) 
G—Whitesbog; 21GT Adelio gave me his name 
in the 
traditional Latin form — Adelio Garcia Nieves, father's last name 
followed by mother's last name. 
The surname he uses here 
is 
Garcia. 
The name of his Puerto Rican neighbor across the street 
is Gumercindo Rivera Ortiz; everyone here calls him "Jimmy." 
(See PFP83—FBB1006) 
Adelio calls him "Gume," which is his 
Spanish nickname. 
He had gone to Puerto Rico to visit his family 
this week, and expected to return a week from today (that would 
be Nov. 17). 
Rivera's father and mother are both living in 
Puerto Rico. 
They are 
in good health, but they are old. 
An old 
person is 
like an old car; you fix one thing, and then something 
else breaks. 
The last time Adelio went to Puerto Rico was 
in 
'73 
when his mother died. 
He had also gone before that when she was 
in the hospital. 
(030) 
Adelio and Jimmy Rivera are the only two Hispanics in 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 37 
this area, Whitesbog/Browns Mills. 
There used to be "un buen 
grupo" (a good—sized group) of Puerto Ricans when the cranberries 
were hand harvested. 
At that time a lot of people used to come, 
but now that everything is mechanized, not too many come. 
The 
bogs where Adelio works belong to JJ White, Inc, owned by Tommy 
Darlington. 
He signs his name Thomas B. Darlington, but is known 
as Tommy. 
Nowadays everything is picked by machine. 
Before, 
when they picked by hand, he would have had 100—some people on 
the blueberry harvest; 
"ve, para la cosecha; no 
'estedi,' para 
la cosecha" (for the harvest, you see; not steady, for the 
harvest). 
Now he has three machines, for blueberries as well as 
cranberries. 
Lots of people don't come there any more. 
When 
they used to have a lot, some stayed here, and some were 
seasonal, they came and went. 
Some came for the harvest, and 
then went to Florida when it was finished. 
Sometimes 4 or 5 or 6 
people stayed on, but ususlly they went to Florida after the 
harvest. 
Adelio has never been to Florida. 
(052) 
He arrived here 
in Browns Mills in 1955. 
He came to 
the US for the first time 
in 1954, but went back to Puerto Rico. 
then he came back 
in 
'55, going first to Bridgeton. 
The next 
year there was little work there, because of drought, and a 
friend of his wrote to him and told him he ought to come here, so 
he did. 
He has been here about 29 years. 
The work in Bridgeton 
was to "cortar parrago" (harvest grapes and tend grapevines), and 
harvest tomatoes. 
The first and second years, he came 
in with a 
migrant workers' organization, a camp. 
(067) 
The camp was located in Glassboro, and the farmers 
came there to hire workers from among those who had come in. 
For 
everyone that the farmers took from the camps, they had to pay 
the camp $10; the camp was a business. 
The workers came to the 
camp, and some were there a week, some 15 — 20 days before they 
were taken out to work; others came one day and were out to work 
the next. 
The farmers were responsible for providing housing for 
the workers once they were out of the camp. 
Once a farmer had 
hired his workers, he also had to pay the camp for what they had 
eaten while they had been there, 
whatever their expenses were. 
It was definitely a business, for the profit of the camp owner. 
The farmer might have taken your camp expense money out of your 
wages. 
Adelio worked through the camps for two years. 
(092) 
The house where Adelio and Selina live belongs to the 
state now. 
The farmer for whom he works pays a rent to the state 
for this and two other adjacent houses. 
This land and the houses 
used to belong to him, the farmer, but he sold them to the state. 
The bogs and fields are just across route 70 from here, about 5 
minutes from the house. 
The farmer sends a truck over to pick 
them up for work. 
The farmer provides the waders, pruning 
shears, and all 
the equipment needed. 
It's pretty good work. 
Adelio works steady during the cranberry and blueberry harvests, 
but when things are slower, pruning and such, 
he only works 
three days a week. 
He has to be sure not to earn too much, 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 38 
because he draws social security. 
He works part—time right 
through the winter. 
The company sees to the maintenance of the 
machines; they don't have to work on them. 
(135) 
He and "Gume" work behind the machines during the 
harvest, seeing to the filling of the blueberry boxes on a little 
hand car behind the harvesting machine. 
They also work in the 
water, 
in the flooded cranberry bogs, gathering up the berries. 
Many people come by to photograph and look at the cranberry 
harvest. 
(145) 
Adelio cuts firewood from whatever clearing brush the 
farmer gives him, and he buys the rest (for the woodstove in the 
living room). 
He will burn 4 or 5 cords in a winter. 
He doesn't 
use the firewood cutting program offered by the state forest 
nearby because he doesn't have a vehicle and doesn't drive. 
For 
his job, transportation is provided. 
When he buys firewood, 
it 
is delivered. 
(162) 
The ditches around his house get filled with leaves, 
and he has to clean them out from time to time, but this is his 
own business, not something to do with the company. 
When he has 
free time, he likes to work around the yard. 
There are chickens 
in his yard, but they belong to Rivera. 
At the moment, he 
is 
feeding them and taking care of them while Rivera is 
in Puerto 
Rico. 
Adelio has no chickens himself, but he has about 15 cats; 
some of them technically belong to Rivera, but they all come and 
go, and eat, at each house. 
They don't bother the chickens, and 
neither does the dog, though sometimes he gets one in his mouth, 
but he doesn't hurt it. 
A man who lives nearby, who is a 
schoolteacher in Trenton, had four ducks and a goose, and one day 
a wild dog came around and killed two of them. 
There are "perros 
... ambulantes" (wandering dogs) all around here; they haven't 
seen chickens and ducks before, so they kill them. 
(200) 
Rivera's step—daughter (the daughter of the woman he 
lives with, referred to as his step—daughter) 
is pregnant, but 
hasn't given birth yet; she lives 
in a rented house in 
Hightstown, and has a boyfriend. (She 
is due any day.) 
(217) 
Selina has lived here longer than Adelio. 
She 
is 
from Virginia. 
She came here 
in 
1929, to the place they call 
"Dick's Matter (?)". 
That old house burned down. 
Her mother and 
father used to live there, but they're dead. 
She and Adelio 
lived in a camp called "Rome" before they came to this house. 
When the man who owned it sold it, they burned the houses; the 
houses were old and when the state took them over they burned 
them. 
If they didn't do that, people would just come into them 
and set fire to them; to avoid that, the state burned them. 
"That was old houses, anyhow." 
They weren't any good for people 
to 
live 
in any more. 
(243) 
Sometimes there are forest fires, 
in the summer, 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 39 
though there haven't been many too near here. 
But sometimes 
there are. 
(246) 
Adelio and Selina moved to this house in 1967. 
At 
that time, 
'they' gave the house across the road to "Gume", and 
this one to them. 
Adelio met "Gume" when they were living in 
Rome; they weren't acquiainted in Puerto Rico. 
Rivera is from 
Cayey, and Adelio from Barceloneta (in Puerto Rico). 
Cayey 
is 
in 
the interior, and Barceloneta is on the coast. 
The culture is 
really the same, jibara music, orchestras, bombas and plenas, 
rhumbas and merengues; what you call 
in English "country music." 
In New York there is a radio station, WADO, which broadcasts in 
Spanish 24 hours a day, and there are other stations in 
Philadelphia and Trenton. 
Adelio listens to Puerto Rican music 
on the radio. 
(278) 
Adelio always eats comida criolla, rice, beans, and 
so on. 
But sofrito can now be purchased readymade in the stores, 
and Adelio gets sweet peppers and onions which Selina cooks with 
fried meats ("el guisado"), and with rice. 
She knows how to cook 
spanish style, too. 
She learned from Adelio. 
She isn't supposed 
to eat too much grease, because of an "ulcerated stomach" and 
high blood pressure. 
She also has varicose veins. 
Neither of 
them is allowed to eat too much grease. 
Adelio had two 
operations for a blockage in the stomach. 
He was 
in great pain, 
and the took him to the hospital. 
Two days later he went under 
the knife. 
The first operation didn't work, so about 7 days 
later he had another, and 
it worked. 
He was working, and was 
overcome with pain. 
In those days he still drank. 
He told 
"Gume" that the cold water he had drunk had given him a stomach 
ache. 
He came home and drank two or three beers to see 
if 
it 
would get better, but it didn't work. 
The next day, his brother 
came from Chatsworth, and he and "Gume" decided to call 
an 
ambulance to take him to the hospital, because the pain wouldn't 
stop. 
Adelio said they should wait one more day to see 
if 
it 
would go away, but they said no. 
He thought that in the hospital 
they would just give him some kind of medicine, but the doctor 
said he had to stay, and needed an operation. 
The operation was 
the next day. 
"Gume" had presented himself as a family member, 
and the doctor told him things were bad, and 
if they had waited 
any longer, Adelio would have died. 
This was in 1978. 
Now he 
is 
fine, and he goes for a checkup every 6 months to the Memorial 
Hospital 
in Mount Holly, where the operation was. 
He was 
in 23 
days then. 
Selina goes there too for her checkups. 
(352) 
Selina used to wear surgical stockings, but the 
doctor told her to stop wearing them for a while. 
"Yet and 
still" she has problems, and gets tired out easily and has to sit 
with her feet up. 
"I feel a lot better when, you know, I'm not 
stirring around too much at times. 
It's a tiresome feeling." 
Sometimes her legs swell, and it's better when she puts her feet 
up. 
Her back sometimes bothers her too, and her hands. 
Part of 
it 
is arthritis; it's not painful, exactly, just sort of numb. 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 40 
Selina's neighbor, Minnie (who lives with Rivera) sometimes takes 
her to Mount Holly to the doctor's; she has a driver's license. 
Sometimes Selina's sister takes her. 
Rivera knows how to drive, 
but doesn't have a license; he drives a little, but not on the 
highway. 
Sometimes he drives down to the corner, where this road 
meets route 70, to check the mail. 
Before the store was torn 
down, just at then end of this line of houses, the mail came 
there. 
This waw some time ago, when the company store was still 
there. 
When the people who kept it died, the company wasn't 
interested in maintaining it, 
so the took it down. 
They used to 
do all their marketing there, meats and vegetables and all.

G—Whitesbog; 21GT In 1350 and through '60 there was no 
store in Browns Mills, but now it 
is a regular town. 
They have 
McDonald's and everything. 
The only thing they don't have is a 
theater. 
The nearest ones are 
in Highstown and Mount Holly. 
They don't go to the movies any more, anyway, because they have a 
TV. 
When Adelio came here in the 50's, he used to go to the 
movies in Hightstown. In that time there still weren't too many 
TV's. 
Now that they have a TV, there's no reason to go to the 
movies. 
Some people go when there is a new film, but the TV 
carries films and stories anyhow. 
Adelio doesn't really watch it 
too much, because he prefers music on the radio, but Selina likes 
to watch it. 
She likes the 'stories' 
like Guiding Light and As 
the World Turns. 
He doesn't like the stories too much. 
Guiding 
Light is Selina's "main" story; also As the World Turns, Dukes of 
Hazzard. 
On Friday nights they watch Dukes of Hazzard, and 
Dallas, and Falcon Crest, right in a row. 
Falcon Crest is the 
last one, from 10 to 11. 
These Adelio likes too, but he doesn't 
have much enthusiasm for the daytime stories. 
I mentioned that I 
watch Dallas too, and that I am from Texas. 
Adelio said oh yes, 
Dallas is 
in Texas, and that's where they killed the president. 
They couldn't exactly remember what year that was, 67 or 68? 
He 
was a good president, and everyone mourned for him. 
The good 
ones always get done 
in.

Behind the picture of King is a necklace, which was 
given to Selina by a sargent who used to take them to the clinic 
for their allergy shots. 
"The man gave it to us for a gift." 
It's made of some kind of seeds, and Adelio thinks it 
looks 
Hawaiian. 
(090) 
Neither Selina nor Adelio has any children, but they 
have lots of pictures of the children of all their friends from 
the camp. 
They are school pictures. 
There is also a picture of 
James, Rivera's grandson, the first son of his step—daughter, 
whom he 
is raising. 
He 
is nearly 9 years old come January. 
This 
picture was taken when he was 2 years old. 
He is 
like a son of 
theirs: 
"Ese negrito, nosotros to queremos como si fuera hijo de 
nosotros" (We love that little black boy as 
if he were our own 
son). 
The night he was born, they went to see him in the 
hospital. 
His mother more or less ignores him, so he 
lives with 
his grandmother; he calls Rivera "grandpa". 
When he wants 
something, 
like a bicycle, Rivera will pay for half and Adelio 
and Selina pay for half. 
Rivera loves him like a son, and so do 
they. 
He and his mother are Blacks, but she 
is more fair than 
dark. 
It 
is said that her mother liked to go with white men, and 
that her father is white; that is why she is so fair, and has 
blue eyes. 
James looks a little more black, 
his hair and all, 
but he is also fair—skinned. 
He doesn't speak any Spanish, 
though they all 
try to teach him a word or too. 
He can say 
"adios, amigo." 
Maybe later on he'll 
learn some more Spanish. 
He goes to school 
in Browns Mills. 
He walks down to the store. 
They still call 
the building the store, even though it's not 
really a store any more. The school bus picks him up there. 
(142) 
At this time year, there are hunters around here, 
hunting deer and rabbits. 
This is state land, so the state must 
let them do it. 
There are two or three rabbit seasons each year, 
but only one deer season, though they do also give one or two 
other days for killing does. 
In the regular season, they only 
allow the killing of bucks. 
During the season, the state puts up 
signs warning against firing near the houses. animal

to get into a fight, you might as well only have your

fists. 
Adelio hasn't been in any fights, either, though he has 
mouthed off at people when he's been drunk. 
Now, since the 
operation, he no longer drinks. 
It was his decision to stop 
drinking when he got out of the hospital; he didn't want to go 
back toit. 
Sometimes, when he would start drinking, he would go 
on a "roll," drinking for a week or two. 
He would miss work, and 
not eat, and everything. 
He would drink beer, whiskey, anything. 
He had stopped smoking before he came here; he left that vice in 
Puerto Rico. 
But he kept on drinking. 
Often his friends would 
ask him how the hell 
he could drink so much and not smoke, but he 
said because I quit it. 
The doctor advised him not to drink, but 
he really made up his own mind to stay dry. 
He was in the 
hospital 23 days without alcohol, so he decided to keep off 
it. 
Sometimes Rivera will tell him that a beer or two wouldn't hurt, 
but he remembers how gross he would get when he drank, and 
is 
afraid that he might get a taste for it again 
if he tries it. 
Sometimes the appetite grabs you. 
When Adelio was on the 
whiskey, he would be up all night, every half hour, for another 
shot, and he wouldn't let Selina get any sleep. 
She had to "walk 
the floor" all night; "it was nerve—wracking. 
I was glad it 
stopped." 
She used to drink too, but she would control 
it 
better, though it often made her sick. 
Adelio was out of 
control. 
He would get up 
in the morning and see all the empty 
bottles, and start tipping them to see 
if there was another 
little sip. 
There were some times when he would set out from 
here on foot to get to the bar in Browns Mills; sometimes friends 
would see him and give him a ride, but if no one passed, he would 
walk the whole way. Now, when he sees people who drink a lot, he 
has pity for them, because he used to be the same way, and he 
knows that the vice can overpower reason: 
when he was without a 
shot of rum, he was 
in despair. 
Smoking is the same. People will 
do anything for a cigarette. 
And now the young people are the 
same way with marijuana, and they will stop at nothing to get it. 
He doesn't see that it 
is really any worse than cigarettes, and 
wonders why they don't legalize it, since 95% of everybody uses 
it anyway. 
All the artists and performers use drugs of some 
kind, you see how they leap around and sing like mad. 
Take the 
example of Elvis Presley, who used so many drugs; how else 
in the 
world can someone keep it up, singing day and night. 
Marijuana, 
caffeine, they are all drugs. 
Coffee is a drug too, 
if 
it has 
caffeine. 
Adelio uses Sanka, because it 
is decaffeinated. 
In 
the hospital they gave him Sanka, and the doctors recommended it 
to him. 
He likes coffee, but can't drink regular coffee, or 
strong coffee. 
(291) 
When he got out of the hospital, they recommended to 
him also that he drink "esa leche que no tiene vitaminas" (this 
milk without vitamins), but he kept on drinking regular milk. 
He 
told Selina that was nuts, 
it was no different than water. 
If 
that was what he wanted, he'd drink water or he might just as 
well wash his hands in that milk. 
The doctor told Selina the 
same thing, and she drank it, 
and she got very thin. 
Adelio told 
her she better change her diet back or she would die, she was 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 44 
just living on white water. 
That skim milk, milk without cream 
in 
it, 
is no more than water. 
There is no nourishment in 
it. 
They told both of them to 
leave off fried foods, but they still 
eat fried meat, and haven't had any trouble. 
They eat what they 
want: fried meat, rice, beans, yams, "yautia" M. They told the 
doctor so. 
"Uno no se muere mas que una Bola vez." (You only die 
one time.) 
If you eat something and it hurts you, then you have 
to 
leave 
it alone, but if 
it doesn't bother you, why worry? 
Anyhow, Adelio really likes fried meat; 
it 
is what he 
is used to. 
When he 
left the hospital, the nurse told him not to eat salt, 
but he said his meat would be flavorless without salt. 
A week 
later he had an interview with the dietician, and complained 
about the salt restriction, and she said it had been a mistake. 
Sometimes, such as for "alta presion" (high pressure) it really 
is bad to eat to eat salt. 
For a while he had to eat only roast 
meats, but one day he just got tired of 
it, 
and tried a "fritura" 
(fried meat) again, without ill 
effect, so he went back to 
it. 
He eats all kinds of meats, pork, chicken, turkey; the doctor 
recommended lamb, because it 
is easy to cut off the fat. 
(376) 
Adelio's brother, Francisco Negron, 
lives 
in 
Chatsworth. 
He 
is really a half—brother, but they are brothers 
in the sense of "crianza" (raising), because Negron's father 
brought them both up. 
Garcia was the name of Adelio's "padre 
principal" (main father", but the father who raised him was 
Cisco's father. 
They are not brothers by the same parents, but 
by "crianza y familia" (raising and family). 
They are the same 
as family. 
They visit quite a bit; Negron comes here to visit. 
Not during the cranberry harvest, though, because over there they 
work 7 days a week during the harvest. 
That farmer, Bill Haines, 
works steady, 7 days, during the cranberry harvest. 
The same is 
true for blueberries: 
once he starts "sigue de 
'roll'" (he 
is 
on 
a roll), and he doesn't stop for anything. 
The farmer that 
Adelio has, Tommy, doesn't like to work Saturdays and Sundays. 
That's better, though it wouldn't be so bad, because it's only 
for the harvest. 
Nevertheless, they work only five days.

(003) 
G—Whitesbog; 21GT Some people work on the cranberry 
harvest who came in 
daily from Philadelphia or other towns, and 
someone drives them here. 
A certain percentage of each 'ticket' 
(?) 
is for them. 
They still do the cranberry harvesting by hand 
in some places, and this 
is better because they only pick the 
ripe ones, whereas the machines knock off all 
of them. 
They have 
to pay more for the labor in that case, but they also make more, 
because there is lass waste. 
The farmer Adelio works for 
sometimes has to throw out as much as a third of his harvest 
because the berries are green. 
The green ones have to be thrown 
out. 
(024) 
Selina observed that it had started to rain, and 
Adelio said that the forecast was for heavy rain this afternoon. 
Sometimes the forecasters are right, sometimes wrong. 
The one 
who really determines what happen is "el 
de arriba" (the one up 
above). 
The weatherman has a machine that tells what should 
happen, but sometimes God changes it. 
It is Nature which 
commands. 
You can't really depend on the weatherman. 
(033) 
Cranberry harvesting goes on 
in the rain, too, but 
blueberries have to dry before they can be picked. 
The 
blueberries get damaged if they are picked wet, but cranberries 
are picked wet anyway. 
The only time they don't pick if 
it's 
raining 
is when there is 
lightning and thunder; the law forbids 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reef 
logs 
page 46 
it then. 
Poeple can't be out in the water picking in the 
lightning and thunder. 
(041) 
A man came by and spoke to Selina at the door. 
It 
was "Bobby" and he came to bring Adelio's check. 
They usually 
bring it 
in Friday, but today is Thursday. 
It must be because 
tomorrow is a holiday celebration Veteran's Day. They get paid every 
Friday, unless there is a holiday, 
in which case they get paid 
the day before, because the bank will be closed on the holiday. 
Adelio cashes his paychecks at the Acme supermarket in Browns 
Mills; he has a check—cashing card there, and they will always 
cash his check because he 
is a regular client of theirs; he 
always does his shopping there. 
They will cash the paycheck 
regardless of whether he 
is making purchases at the time or not. 
He cashes his social security check at the bank, though, because 
it 
is a bigger check, and the supermarket might not have enough 
money on hand to cash it. 
If he goes with the two checks to the 
Acme, they will onlycash one of them. 
Adelio has about $400 in 
the bank,so they will cash his checks. 
He signs them, and they 
put on his account number, and they cash it. 
When Selina has a 
check, her sister signs for her. 
(087) 
Selina's last name 
is Albes. 
She was once married to 
a Portuguese man, whose last name was Albes, so that is still her 
last name. 
Her name 
is also on Adelio's bank account, so she can 
cash her checks there too. 
they have medicare, which pays for a 
part of their medical expenses. 
Adelio also has Blue Cross and 
Blue Shield through his work, paid for by the company, but Selina 
isn't covered. 
What medicare doesn't pay for Adelio's expenses, 
the Blue Cross does. 
He was lucky to have these when he was 
in 
the hospital, because otherwise he wouldn't have been able to pay 
for it. 
(111) 
In Chatsworth, Adelio thinks there are about 15 or 20 
Puerto Ricans. 
There are more there then here, because the 
farmer there hires more. 
They stick together pretty much. 
Adelio's farmer only has the two, and the rest of his workers are 
"americuchos," Americans. 
The Hispanics in Chatsworth live there 
permanently and work the year around, just as Adelio and Jimmy 
do. 
The migrants who come and go are different; those who live 
here the year around work steady. 
Adelio is a legal 
resident 
here, votes here and everything. 
There are still a lot of 
"puertorros" (Puerto Ricans) who come only for the harvest, but 
that is a different matter. 
As soon as their contract is over, 
they go back to Puerto Rico. 
The government of Puerto Rico 
doesn't send people to Florida; those who want to go there have 
to pay their own way. 
The ones who come here to work have their 
way paid by the government of Puerto Rico. 
When Adelio first 
came, 
it wasn't that way; they had to pay their own way. 
But 
now, the camp pays for it, by some agreement with the government; 
the government ends up covering for the travel expenses of those 
who work out their whole contract. 
If they leave early, they 
have to pay for it themselves. 
The government sends people to 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 47 
Jersey and to Massachusetts, but not to Florida. 
Not to New 
York, either, because those who come to New York come to the 
city, so they have to pay their own way also. 
There's not much 
agriculture in New York; that's why. 
They once sent some to 
Michigan, but they don't any more, because the farmers there 
refused to pay them, and the government ended up having to pay 
for it all, so they don't send them to Michigan any more. 
In 
Michigan they ripped them off, and treated them very badly. 
"Gume" once went to Michigan, on his own, and said that the 
mattresses they gave them there were stuffed with the old straw 
from the horses, from the barns, and they had to sleep on the 
floor. 
They didn't even pay them. 
(131) Adelio thinks that there are no 
longer cockfights 
around here like there used to be, because it 
it 
'private' now. 
They still do 
it, but it 
is hidden, because it 
is not legal. 
Of 
course, "juegan gallos" (they play the cocks), but always hidden, 
They do 
it 
in Long Island too, but it's the same story there. 
If 
they are caught they have to pay a big fine. 
In Puerto Rico it 
is 
legal, and they play them a lot. 
Everyone who has a cock will 
fight them, and people place bets on them. 
Even the policemen go 
to them, there. 
When Adelio was a boy he sometimes went to them, 
upin the mountains, but he didn't like them very much. 
Why 
in 
the world would anyone want to watch two chickens fighting? 
There are many people who like 
it, 
but he never did. It's the 
same with boxing; what's the point of seeing two men there 
fighting (laughs). 
Yet many people are fanatics for it. 
When he 
was 15 or so, he sometimes went to the cockfights, but he never 
bet on them; he didn't have anymoney for betting. 
There were 
illegal cockfights in Puerto Rico too, out in the mountains, and 
the police would sometimes come in and arrest people and take 
them away; 
that was 
in the time when they were prohibited, 
before they were legalized. 
The fine then was only about $4 or 
$5, not much, but then people didn't make much then either; a 
worker may have made 55 cents a day. 
animal 
In that time, when you went 
to the store, a pound of rice cost 2 cents, a pound of sugar 1 
and a half cants; two oranges, 1 cent, two bananas, 1 cent. 
In 
those days, people didn't earn much, but they lived ok. 
Look 
what one little banana, or one orange costs you today, 15 or 20 
cents. 
He used to pay a penny for them, or sometimes, when he 
was a boy, just bend down the trees and take 2 or 3, and suck out 
the juice. 
He never bought a mango, just picked them; and now 
they charge $1.50 for one mango in the store. 
In those days 
$1.50 would get you a truckload of mangoes, for sure; they were 
worth a penny. 
In any case, he never paid for them, because he 
had a neighbor with a mango tree. 
When it was windy, and they 
fell down, the neighbor would give him a basket to gather them up 
in, 
and then would give them 10 or 12 to take home. 
They did 
sometimes buy bananas. 
Even people who owned stores hardly 
bothered to sell their mangoes; they gave them to people. 
There 
was a very rich man 
in his town, Antonio Davila, who had a mango 
tree. 
He told them that when there was a ripe mango, they 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 48 
shouldn't throw rocks at it or anything, just climb up and get 
it, eat it, and leave the green ones. 
Because sometimes, they 
would throw rocks at the ripe ones to knock them down, and the 
green ones would fall, too. 
When the boys were walking home from 
school, they always went after the mangoes. 
This guy had three 
trees of one kind of mango, and three of another. 
This one kind 
they called "mangotin," a small round variety, sweet as sugar. 
The other ones they calles "pazote"; 
it was a big mango, the size 
of your hand. 
Then, they ate all 
kinds of fruits: 
"puma rosa" 
(apple?), "tamarindo" (tamarind), "guama" (?). 
Those were all 
just out there growing in the weeds. 
In that time, there was 
still a lot of uncultivated land 
in Puerto Rico, and the fruits 
just grew wild there. "Guayaba" too, a fruit which has many tiny 
seeds in 
it (guava); 
Adelio wondered if I knew of 
it 
in Texas or 
in Mexico. 
He didn't know what it might be called in Mexico 
(same name). 
There were also "la granada" (pomegranates); they 
have a little crown at the bottom. 
They are the same as guayaba, 
they have many seeds. You can buy pomegranates in the Acme. 
In 
the Acme they sell bananas, and at one time they sold frying 
bananas ("platano") and yams "nami" and "yautia", but they 
stopped. 
They must not have done enough business with them. 
Occasionally they still have plantains ("platano," the frying 
banana). 
Yautia is something like a potato, but very nourishing, 
and with a strong flavor. 
Yams are sort of 
like potatoes, too, 
but they have more starch. 
There are two classes of yams: 
some 
are 
long and large, and some are round. 
They are similar in 
color to a potato, sort of white; 
like yautia, too. 
That is not 
the same thing as "la batata", which is what is called sweet 
potato in English; that's not a yam. 
There is a Puerto Rican 
sweet potato ("batata") which is reddish inside, and one which 
has a red skin, and another which is white and has white skin. 
Then there 
is one which they called "la mameya" which is a yellow 
sweet potato; they were called "batata mameya" because they 
resembled the "mamey" (same botanical name 
in English). 
You can 
get sweet potatoes here, and "chayote" (no English equivalent in 
my dictionary, just a description of a "pear—shaped fruit with a 
large stone," Nuevo Diccionario Cuyas de Appleton) , but not 
mamey. 
(334) 
At one time there was a Puerto Rican fellow who had a 
small store in Browns Mills where you could get these things, but 
he was killed. 
Someone came in to rob him, and they shot him and 
he died. 
He was a veteran, and lived 
in Hightstown. 
It seems 
that when they came ion to rob him, he recognized one of them. 
He went looking for a revolver or something, and they shot him. 
He wasn't killed that instant. 
They took him to the veteran's 
hospital 
in Hightstown, and he died that same night. 
His name 
was Victor Cintron. 
After him there was another Puerto Rican 
owner for two years, and then the store was taken over by a 
Portuguese, but he didn't know the business very well. 
After him 
there was another Puerto Rican, but he was the same, not like the 
other two; he just didn't know business well. Now some Chinese 
people run 
it, but they sell other stuff, oriental foods, not 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 49 
Hispanic. 
They have an oriental name for the store. 
Adelio is 
not familiar with the International foods store in Pemberton, 
though he goes through Pemberton to get to Mount Holly. 
He has 
heard of 
it, 
and knows that they sell Puerto Rican foods and 
vegetables. 
That's how the one was 
in Browns Mills, 
it was a 
small store, but when Victor had it, he had everything: 
yams, 
batata, yautia, chayote, calabaza (squash), platano, guineo 
(bananas), all 
the Spanish stuff. 
(376) 
In those times they paid the farm workers in cash. 
Then, after Victor was killed a policeman from Browns Mills 
suggested to Tommy (Darlington) that he pay by check, so he 
wouldn't have cash on hand to tempt robbery. 
That policeman 
worked half—days on the farm, and was a policeman the rest of the 
time. 
It was his idea to change over to payment by check. 
The 
first time they were issued a check it made trouble, because no 
one had any identification besides social security cards, and 
they didn't have money 
in the bank, so no one wanted to cash the 
checks. 
There was a market in Browns Mills, Galeski's, where 
Adelio bought beer, bread, and such. 
He knew Adelio, so he 
cashed the check, but the Acme and the bank had both refused. 
Once the Acme started the system of check—cashing cards, there 
was no more problem, because you had a number with them. 
Now 
that Adelio has a few dollars in the bank, he can cash his checks 
there, too, but before they wouldn't do 
it.

TXO1: (Refer also to PFP83—FBB1112. Interview took place at St. 
Joseph's Parish Hall G—Hammonton; 11GT, where the interviewee(s) 
along with others, were setting up for a large—scale party to be 
held that night. 
One of the featured events of the party was to 
be the election of the queen of the Puerto Rican Community of 
Hammonton; her coronation will be at another party, December 3. 
There is much background noise of tables and chairs being moved, 
and people conferring about the set—up. 
The Puerto Rican Civic 
Association's Spanish name is Asociacion Civica Puertorriquena, 
hence it's Spanish initials, ACP. 
Interview was conducted in 
Spanish, though Angelina, who 
is 
15, sometimes preferred to speak 
English. 
All quotes appear in the language in which they were 
spoken.) 
(010) 
The Puerto Rican Civic Association has both male and 
female members, totalling about 30 members in all. 
Rodriguez 
estimates the Hammonton Puerto Rican population's size at 2500-
3,000. 
(030) 
The ACP is dedicated to helping out the Puerto Rican 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 51 
community, and their fundraising efforts are to get money for 
various needs, both personal and community. 
Every year they give 
a small scholarship to a Hispanic high school student who wishes 
to pursue a higher education. 
They also give money and services 
to those in personal need, such as victims of house fires. 
A man 
recently came to them in need of funds to return to Puerto Rico 
to get medical treatment for his cancer, since he has no papers 
qualifying him for medical assistance in the US. 
The ACP issued 
him a check for $180, and took him to the airport. 
(048) 
In the Hammonton area there is farming of 
blueberries, tomatoes, potatoes, strawberries, peaches. 
Cranberries are not grown in this area, as far as they know, but 
are concentrated "para Chatsworth." 
(053) The ACP has a treasury from which aid monies are 
drawn, but they also depend on their members to work diligently 
to see that the treasury is maintained, and people's needs are 
made known and met. 
They have to work hard, and 
if they don't, 
it 
is the community which suffers. 
The land on which the ACP 
building is built was donated by one family. (See also PFP83— 
FBB1119 and PFP83—RBB014/015.) The association was formed in 
1959; the building was all built by voluntary labor from within 
the Hispanic community. 
The first Hispanics arrived in Hammonton 
in about 1955. 
The original organization had 12 members; a few 
of the original members are still alive and active, about 3; 
the 
rest have died or moved away. Torres joined the organization in 
1962; then he 
left the state for 13 years, but when he returned 
to Hammonton at the end of those 13 years, he resumed active 
membership, and has remained a member since then. 
(087) 
Many of the Hispanics in Hammonton still have 
relatives in Puerto Rico, and they try to go back to visit when 
they can. 
Rodriguez has uncles and cousins there; he has not 
been back for three years, but is hoping to go sometime this 
year. 
Torres has uncles, brothers, and his parents there; he has 
not been for 10 years and would like to go next year. 
In the 
meantime, his mother has been here to visit him and his family 
several times. 
They usually work it out this way because it 
is 
cheaper to bring her here than to fly all of them there. 
(105) 
At the party on this night, the Queen will 
be elected 
and announced. 
On December 3 she will be crowned; also that 
night there will be soldiers present, with the flags of Spain and 
Puerto Rico; the church hispanic youth group will also be 
represented. 
(115) 
Once the ACP surprised a woman whose son was away in 
the marines and whom she hadn't seen in 2 or 3 years. 
There were 
soldiers present at an ACP event, and Rodriguez had arranged for 
her son to be there among them. 
He had told the other women 
in 
the community about it, 
and told them to help out in keeping it a 
surprise; they crowded around the soldiers in order to prolong 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 52 
the surprise, and give the mother time to be at the event and be 
used to the soldiers' presence before she spotted her son among 
them. 
This was last year. 
(130) 
ACP monies are used for personal and institutional 
gifts, and for their own operating expenses, such as the 
utilities costs on their building (it is paid for in full), 
events production costs, 
liquor licenses for events. 
The only 
time they really make a profit is when they have a dance. 
The 
proceeds go mainly to pay the music and the food, but what is 
left after expenses is added to the treasury fund. 
They try to 
maintain the fund at a minimum level of $1,500 to $2,000, so that 
they will have money ready to hand 
in the event of an emergency. 
Once there was a fire which left 13 families homeless, and the 
ACP organized a marathon which collected $2,500 in aid, plus 
donations of clothing and food; these were divided equally among 
the affected families. 
All 
the club members dedicate themelves 
to the work, though there is a core group of 12 to 15 who are the 
prime movers. 
When there 
is 
an event which requires more help, a 
request is made, and people always respond. 
(166) 
For this party tonight, they are planning to have 
comida criolla, 
including roast pork, potatoes, and little 
bananas (probably roasted or fried); they may have pastries and 
sweets also, but they were uncertain whether that would come off 
or not. 
There will be a bar, serving a variety of hard liquors 
as well as beer; they stocked a lot of rum, which is one of the 
most common drinks in Puerto Rico. 
Rodriguez himself will not be 
able to drink tonight, because he 
is 
in charge of the party's 
smooth functioning; the responsibility for its success 
is his; he 
also has to be on hand to help the kids out, the 6 candidates. 
(130) 
(Rodriguez called Angelina Hernandez to come and recite 
her introduction speech for this evening.) 
Angelina recites her 
introduction speech for the evening, giving a brief biography: 
name, age, and school, thanks to those who have helped her; 
... 
refers to the "club Civico" (the ACP) as "un rinconcito de Puerto 
Rico aqui 
en Hammonton" (a little corner of Puerto Rico here 
in 
Hammonton. 
Also recites her acceptance speech, 
in the event she 
should be elected, thanks especially certain friends and family 
members, congratulates fellow candidates, and expresses gratitude 
to Rodriguez as president of the club. 
(217) 
Rodriguez explained that a lot of the younger people 
don't speak Spanish with great ease, but that these kids are 
devoted to making the effort, and they work hard on their 
speeches. 
If they don't know how to say something fluently, they 
look for someone to help them out with it. 
"La comunidad hispana 
de Hammonton, 
la juventud siempre esta tratendo de 
Ilevar el 
nombre de Puerto Rico en alto," in the Hispanic community of 
Hammonton, the young people are always trying to glorify the name 
of Puerto Rico. 
Angelina and Anna Reveron (also present and a 
candidate for queen) are both 15 years old. 
Anna's twin sister 
is the leader of the Hammonton High cheerleading squad; she 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 53 
coaches the candidates on their posture and on their speeches. 
Anna was too shy to recite her speech for the tape; not shy, she 
said, but "I just don't feel 
like saying it." 
(238) 
Angelina feels that she knows about her own 
background, but "sometimes,...since I'm over here, then I just 
use the American tradition, not the Puerto Rican tradition." 
The 
particular meals that they eat in her home include a lot of rice 
and beans (she laughs). 
She thinks that basically they do the 
same things that the Americans do, except that at Christmas they 
have the three kings along with Christmas, and that in Puerto 
Rico they don't celebrate Halloween. 
Rodriguez said that in his 
town 
in Puerto Rico they did go house to house on Halloween; 
Angelina teases him that he's "talking about the other century." 
Rodriguez said that they did go out with masks on at Halloween, 
but instead of candy they gave money, "50 cents, 25 cents." 
In 
the countryside they made parrandas at Christmastime, going house 
to house and singing. 
They don't do it 
in the city, because 
people don't know each other that well there, and they don't want 
to 
let people into the houses. 
The music of the parrandas is 
musica jibara. celebration 
(275) 
Rodriguez exceses himself to go back to work on the 
arrangements. 
The ACP has it's last meeting of the year on Nov. 
20th, at 3:00, to which I am invited. 
They meet regularly the 
3rd Tuesday of each month at 3:00 p.m., and the first Tuesday at 
7:00 p.m.; they also meet one Sunday a month. 
(230) 
Explain to Angelina about the archive. 
(300) 
Reiterate invitation to the meeting; give me 
directions from the parish hall to the ACP building. 
(As 
it 
later turned out, I had a conflicting appointment, and couldn't 
go to the meeting.) 
Invitation to subsequent meetings as well. 
(330) 
Explain further about the project to Torres and 
Rodriguez. 
Torres suggests it would be good for us to 
include the Puerto 
Rican week in the study; 
it 
is 
in 
late August or early September. 
They begin with a flag—raising ceremony, and have activities all 
week long; they wind up with a day of speeches, and usually the 
mayor comes, though it 
is not certain whether he will come this 
next time. 
They used to always have a parade as well, but this 
past year for the first  time, they were refused a permit for a 
parade because there were new people in the city government who 
were unfamiliar with their traditional observation, and were not 
friendly to their cause, as the previous officeholders had been. 
The other problem was that the officials wanted them to pay a 
very high insurance fee 
in order to obtain the permit, some $300 
for a parade that was only going 5 blocks. 
They don't really 
know what this bodes for the future of the parade. 
They now have 
no one in the city government who 
is 
interested in their cause, 
and who will come to their meetings, or help them out. 
Other 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 54 
groups which hold public functions now also have to pay for their 
own insurances; before the past year, such insurances were 
provided by the town. 
The former mayor cooperated quite closely 
with the Puerto Rican community, but the new mayor doesn't seem 
to be 
interested; 
Representative DiMarco (DeMarco?) was also a 
voice on their side. ethnicity, government

Interview took 
place in Mele'ndez' home, at the kitchen table. 
His youngest 
daughter, Lisa, age 9, was watching TV in an adjacent room; he 
asked her to turn it down, but it 
is still audible on the tape. 
Interview was conducted in English, with occasional words or 
phrases in Spanish.) 
(009) 
Mele'ndez' family were the first Puerto Ricans to come 
to G—Hammonton; 11GT, as well as the first to settle there. 
Mele'ndez was 14 when they arrived. 
There had been Hispanic farm 
workers there before who came seasonally, including Mele'ndez's 
father the year before, but none had brought families with them 
previously. 
The earliest migrant farm workers from Puerto Rico 
came around 1947. 
At that time, their transportation was paid by 
a loan from the farmer for whom they would work, and the loan was 
paid back out of their wages. 
When Mele'ndez's family arrived, his older brother was 15 and 
he was 14. 
It was the beginning of the strawberry season. 
They 
all worked, even the smaller children, through the summer until 
school started. 
Mele'ndez's father first came in 1948 through the 
Glassboro Farm Worker's Association, which recruited in Puerto 
Rico. 
He came looking for a better way of 
life. 
There were 6 
children in the family at that time. 
The following year he came 
back to the same farmer, and brought his wife along to see what 
she thought about the possibility of their moving there; the 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 56 
children stayed in Puerto Rico with their aunt. 
"It was up to 
her...whether we'd make the move or not." 
Mele'ndez's mother also 
worked on the farm that summer, and 
in the fall they went back to 
Puerto Rico and made plans to make the move the following year. 
In the spring of 1950 his father came alone to make housing 
arrangements; the farmer had a house in which they were to 
live. 
His father came 
in March or April, and 
in May he sent plane 
tickets back to his family, which the farmer financed. 
The rest 
of the family arrived in May, and they all worked during that 
summer. 
At that time there were no restrictions on age for farm 
work, and pay was not by the hour but by the quart for 
strawberries. 
The youngest children worked alongside their 
mother, and were paid for how much they picked too. 
Once the 
harvest season started, there was work through October, because 
the farmer had a succession of crops: strawberries, blueberries, 
tomatoes, peaches, apples, sweet potatoes. 
The children who were 
of school age started school 
in September, but continued to work 
on the weekends and school holidays to help out the fanmily. 
After the season was over his father was 
in charge of the farm 
(the other Hispanic workers) and he worked through the winter 
pruning fruit trees, clearing fields. 
Mele'ndez and his brother 
helped out on weekends in the fall, clearing brush. 
Pay was 
according to the number of hours worked, which was dependent on 
the weather conditions. 
(085) 
They arrived on May 21, a time that would be warm in 
Puerto Rico, and found the climate cold and harsh. 
They went to 
work the very next day; "there was no showing you here and 
there." 
He and his brother were set to work with scissors, 
trimming blossoms from the first year strawberry plants; 
it was 
day—long, back—breaking work. For the first two of three months 
he "just hated it." 
He kept telling his mother that he wanted to 
go back to Puerto Rico, and she kept talking to him, telling him 
that he would get used to 
it. 
It was her job to try to make the 
transition easier and give them courage. 
Come September, they 
went to school, and although that was another kind of shock, 
it 
was also a break from the labor. 
In the first months, 
it was so 
bad he felt "if I could walk back, I would walk back". 
Mele'ndez 
was 
in 9th grade, and had left all 
his friends behind, and knew 
no one in the US. 
(120) 
"We were not very welcome in school, but we 
persevered." 
They were the first Hispanic children to enter the 
public schools in Hammonton. 
Mele'ndez and his older brother 
Angelo knew some English, because it had been taught in School 
in 
Puerto Rico, but "it was more of a British English." 
He had A's 
in English in School 
in Puerto Rico, but had trouble talking with 
people in the US, because they spoke faster, and the slang was 
unfamiliar. 
It took "maybe 6 months or so" for him to feel some 
comfort with the language. 
He felt that the teachers were 
supportive, and "persevered with us." 
After the first year, they 
didn't have any trouble academically in school, although they 
were still not very well accepted by the other kids. 
They didn't 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 57 
have many friends 
in school, and had to put up "with a little 
harrassment, ... but it was not that bad." 
This attitude lasted 
through the whole time they were in the high school. 
He and his 
brother had been put back one year 
in the high school when they 
entered, to help counter the language problem. 
"It took us quite 
a bit to stay in and not get discouraged." 
(156) 
Nowadays things are a lot better in the schools, 
although he still feels that the Hispanics are still "put aside" 
in terms of counseling for higher education, "to make them 
understand that education is a priority that they should consider 
first," and the drop—out rate remains higher for the Hispanic 
students. 
"They don't seem to be doing the right counseling to 
keep these kids in school." 
It is a bigger problem for them 
also, because many of their parents don't have an education, and 
they don't necessarily urge their kids to finish high school or 
pursue a higher education. 
Many drop out at the first legal age, 
about 16, when they have only a couple of years to go to finish. 
(180) 
The school department of Hammonton has approached 
Mele'ndez with a request that he help out in organizing the Puerto 
Rican parents to help their kids stay 
in school until they 
graduate. 
With the help of the Puerto Rican Civic Association 
(or, 
in Spanish, Asociacion Civica Puertorriquena, ACP) he 
organized a meeting for parents of Hispanic kids who were having 
trouble 
in school. 
He personally wrote letters of 
invitation to 
all 
the parents, and planned a meeting. 
They had coffee and 
doughnuts, and the superintendent of schools and the two women 
who were the Hispanic liaisons were on hand to talk with the 
parents. 
No one came at all. 
"Here you see the lack of interest 
in the parents' side." 
It is not only the schools' fault, but 
also the parents'. The school needs to develop better relations 
with the Hispanic community. 
Mele'ndez often is asked to serve as 
a liaison. 
The difficulty is 
in reaching the families in the 
first place, since you can't really just approach people and say 
"I hear your kid has a problem;" it's meddling in their personal 
lives. 
The schools would be 
in a better position to approach 
people in this respect than Mele'ndez is, he feels. 
At the moment 
it remains a problem that no one talks about. 
Mele'ndez credits his pursuit of an education with his 
personal success. 
He has five children, "and they're all 
going 
through college, because ... I KNOW what education does for 
people." 
He himself has a high school education, and would have 
gone further, but he soon had a wife and family, and had to go to 
work. 
(230) 
The Hispanics in this area have done well, "but not 
as well as they should have." 
They have been 
in Hammonton 34 
years, and the population has grown tremendously. 
The Hispanic 
population grows faster "than the local residents" because the 
Hispanics tend to have larger families; 
it 
is not unusual for a 
Puerto Rican family to have four or five children. 
In due time, 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 58 
the Hispanic population will outnumber the "locals", yet they 
still 
remain disadvantaged, and don't get into a position "where 
they can better themselves." 
"I don't see the progress; not as 
much as I like to see." 
(248) 
There is no Hispanic representation in the city 
government, nor has there ever been a Hispanic candidate. 
They 
did have an appointment to the Board of Health 4 or 5 years ago, 
but "politically, we're not involved." 
The ACP is civic—minded, 
and "prohibits religious or political affiliation" (of the club 
itself) but there has never been any action directed at amending 
city laws ar affecting local politics, and "it doesn't seem like 
it's going to be for a while." 
It seems that once the Puerto 
Rican children go through a full education, get a college degree, 
"they become Americans; they don't seem to go back to our 
culture." 
They get Anglicized as they get educated, while the 
older people keep the Spanish traditions and affairs. 
The kids 
often know Spanish, "but they won't use it." 
Mele'ndez and his 
wife speak Spanish to their children, who understand everything 
they say, but they answer in English. 
Most families make sure to 
teach their kids Spanish, knowing that the English will come 
through school, TV, etc. 
At least it 
is good for them to have 
the language in case they need it sometime, and 
it 
is good that 
they can understand it easily. 
Mele'ndez thinks that even that 
tradition is fading, and that his grandchildren's generation may 
not even be taught Spanish in the way that his children were. 
His children do not practice it, and he feels cartain that they 
won't practice it with their kids, when they start having kids. 
"In due time it'll be...put aside." 
(298) 
Still, his generation tries to maintain the 
traditions. 
They have a Spanish Mass, the Club, social dances, 
parties and affairs. 
In the generation who were born in Puerto 
Rico and came here there is a strong sense of Hispanic identity. 
In addition, there is a hometown or regional 
identity among the 
Puerto Ricans here. They tend to fraternize most with those who 
are from their own region 
in Puerto Rico originally. 
(321) 
There are problems which he describes as "small—town 
problems" as well; motor vehicle violations, drugs, to some 
extent. 
When the Hispanic community was more newly arrived, the 
law enforcement officers tended to be harsher with the Puerto 
Ricans than with the "locals," and took advantage of their 
ignorance of the system. 
Mele'ndez thinks that in some measure, 
though, the Hispanics themselves are at fault in their 
harrassment and singling out, because they haven't made enough 
effort to become involved in the 
local community, joining the 
other local clubs, e.g., and becoming more known to the locals. 
(359) 
There has been a Spanish mass at St. Joseph's church 
for the past 10 years, and the church works along with the 
Hispanic community, and makes outreach efforts. 
No local clubs 
or organizations have approached the Hispanic community to 
invite 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 59 
their participation. 
Mele'ndez believes that it 
is up to the 
Puerto Ricans to take the first step, but " I haven't been able 
to get these people to take the first step." 
(370) 
Mele'ndez is 
in something of a leadership position in 
the Hispanic community, partly by virtue of his experience. 
He 
was also the first one to organize the Club (ACP), 
in 1959. 
The 
club purchased the property, with a building which was the basis 
for the existing building. 
At the time of purchase, there were 
no utilities; 
it was a warehouse. 
All 
of the work was done 
voluntarily by members of the Puerto Rican community. 
They have 
never hired any of 
it done "except for maybe an electrician once 
in a while."

G—Hammonton; 11GT Club members include people who are 
good at masonry, carpentry, all phases of construction. 
they do 
all 
of the repairs and construction. 
At the time they did all 
the renovations and new construction to the site, the Pinelands 
Reserve had not yet been created, and all of their permits were 
local. 
Now, they are within the Reserve, and 
if they wanted to 
make changes they would have to go through the Pinelands 
Commission. 
For them, this 
is really a moot point, because their 
facilities are complete now, and they have used up all 
the land 
they have to build on. 
(018) 
They have recreational facilities there for social 
activities. 
It 
is a meeting hall, and a hall for parties and 
fundraising activities. 
They make it available for anyone to 
use, not just the Hispanic community, and for institutional and 
private functions. 
They have often rented the hall for birthday 
parties, baptisms; smaller social dances are held here, though 
larger ones, of which there are 2 or 3 each year, are held in the 
parish hall of St. Joseph's church. 
(031) 
The turnout was very good at the Queen's Election 
dance on November 12. 
(See PFP83—RBB013 and PFP83—FBB1112.] 
They had 300-400 people, and they anticipate a similar turnout on 
December 3 for the coronation. 
This is the Big Event of the 
6lair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 61 
year, and the Club's major fundraising function, these two 
dances. 
The treasury of the ACP is 
all 
used for maintenance of 
the building and to meet individual needs, such as the recent 
collection for a memorial for some firemen who were killed in a 
fire. 
All disbursements are approved by the membership. 
In an 
emergency, the president can write a check, but he must confer 
with at least one other officer before issuing it, and 
if the 
other officer disagrees with the allotment, 
it cannot be 
disbursed. 
Mele'ndez knows of no instance of a refusal. 
Checks 
so 
issued are always reported to the members at the next meeting. 
(066) 
The membership of the Club stands at about 40, 
including the Women's Auxiliary, who may actually outnumber the 
men at this point. 
The Auxiliary was started about 5 years ago. 
Some 10 years ago, there was a first attempt made, but the group 
started then didn't last long. 
About 5 years ago, Mele'ndez made 
the push to start the Auxiliary up again. 
He felt that the women 
would have more time than the men "to join the local setups. 
Actually, 
it hasn't happened yet. 
And I keep preaching for it." 
He thought that the women would be affiliated with other town 
organizations within a year or two, and he emphasizes the 
importance of such affiliation as a club goal. 
The Club has 
drawn up a list of 
local organizations (the fire company, the 
rescue squad, the hospital) which could use help from the ACP, 
and they hope to make an annual donation to each of them. 
So far 
they have not made such donations, because they have been 
investing 
in their own construction and growth. 
He hopes that 
they will be able to help out, and "maybe that's where the 
recognition will come." 
They give a small scholarship to the 
Hispanic student who "wants to further his education", and they 
hope to 
increase the size of that award, and to become more 
publicly recognized via their active donations. 
They are 
recognized by the town officials, but not by the public. 
(128) 
"Our problem mostly is that, all 
our membership is 
hardworking people, with very little time to devote to social 
activities and stuff like that. (...) There's not too many who're 
working just five days a week. 
Most of them are 6 and 7 days a 
week workers; trying to improve themselves. 
So ... there's no 
time to socialize, really." 
(139) 
Some Hispanics are not willing "to become part of the 
American way." 
There is some paradox between maintaining the 
Hispanic identity and adapting to American ways and joining in. 
there are some Hispanics who have a sort of separatist attitude. 
Mele'ndez remains optimistic, though. 
(154) 
Hispanics still stick with the traditional foods. 
Especially in thje older generations, they kept up the foods and 
the traditions. 
In Hammonton, they do make parrandas at 
christmastime, visiting from house to house, though "it's getting 
less and less," partly because the original newcomers are getting 
older, and the newer generation "is not following it up." 
But 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 62 
even 
in PR, 
it's not like 
it used to be. 
When Mele'ndez was a kid 
in Puerto Rico, the festivities started up the 15th or so of 
December, and lasted until January 9th or 10th. 
"Now, 
it's not 
even half as much." 
His relatives tell him that the tradition is 
changing. 
One reason is 
laws against making noise in the 
streets. When they were kids they would make all kinds of noise: 
"I mean, 
it was a celebration." 
One man who was a tinsmith used 
to make a rattle out of a cracker tin ; the kids would tie a 
string of tin cans to a dog's tail and let the dog "run wild 
in 
the street." 
In Hammonton, the parranda is much lower key. 
A 
group of people with guitars come to your door at night, and you 
have them in for food and drink and then they go to the next 
house. 
Members of the houses where they have stopped already 
will join in, 
so the group gets larger as the night goes on, and 
they often go all night. 
Where Mele'ndez lives, 
it 
is pretty 
rural, so 
it 
is OK for them to come around, and make all the 
noise they want; his next door neighbors are Hispanics too, so 
they wouldn't complain. 
They don't do them intown, because 
people will complain. 
they are done from about a week or so 
before Christmas until the 6th of January. 
(213) 
Mele'ndez' family does not observe the Dia de 
los 
Reyes at home. 
Their children have grown up with Santa Claus. 
there are a few families who do still keep the day, but not too 
many. 
As a child, the most important day for Mele'ndez was not 
Christmas, which was an important religious day, but the Three 
Kings' Day, which was when the children got their presents. 
They 
didn't have the tradition of Santa Claus, even though they had 
heard of 
it. 
The church would have some observance in which 
people dressed as the Kings, but in hs town there was no parade. 
Each child at home would put a cardboard box under the bed with 
grass and water for the camels of the Magi, and the next day, 
they would find the grass and water gone, and a toy in the box. 
The legend was that the Kings had come on their camels and left 
the gift. 
Kids usually kept this legend alive until they were 
about 10 or 12 years old. 
Whatever was found in each child's box 
was their own, and though it might not have been much, "because 
those were hard times" they appreciated it and felt it was 
special. 
Nowadays, Mele'ndez feels, kids quickly become bored 
with even extravagant toys. 
When his family first came here they 
kept up the Three Kings' tradition for a few years, but then gave 
it up. 
(285) 
At the Club they have a small celebration of the 
Three Kings, and have people dress as the Kings and give small 
gifts to the children, to keep the kids aware of 
it as "our 
tradition," but few people observe it 
in their homes any more. 
the church has an observation as well. 
The church also sponsors 
an enactment of the Death and Passion of Christ (at Easter) 
celebration but "not as they used to." "It has modernized..." 
because people are more involved with other things. 
"The old traditions are not here any more, really." 
They do have 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 63 
a re—creation of the Nativity during the Spanish mass at 
Christmastime. 
Mele'ndez is currently growing a beard, because 
he will be playing St. Joseph 
in that play; this will be his 
third year. 
His wife will play Mary, as she has also done 
before, and they have a live infant as the baby Jesus. 
This 
is a part of the mass. 
The shepherds come 
in, and they enact 
the whole drama. 
This year it will be on Christmas day, because 
it falls on a Sunday. 
(335) 
All Hispanics, Mele'ndez feels, have basically the 
same observances surrounding the Christmas season. 
The Mexicans 
in Texas will be making similar celebrations to the Puerto Ricans 
in Hammonton, though they have posadas instead of parrandas. 
(351) 
The name parranda he thinks is a Puerto Rican 
construction, which willnot necessarily appear in the dictionary, 
He does not know what its origin is, but feels it 
is a localism, 
specific to Puerto Rico. 
Each Spanish—speaking group or country 
has its own accent, slang terms, almost its own language. 
Much 
of Puerto Rican Spanish will not be 
in a Spanish dictionary. 
He 
feels somewhat uneasy speaking to Spaniards at times, because 
their Spanish is so much more formal, and they don't understand 
the Puerto Rican slang. 
Fr. Jose, of St. Joseph's church, 
is a 
Spaniard, and he sometimes criticizes the Puerto Rican members of 
the congregation for speaking ungrammatical or incorrect Spanish. 
(380) 
There are local musicians who play for the parrandas, 
a "typical folk music." 
Mostly, the musicians play guitars, and 
most of them play "out of their heads; they don't even know how 
to read music." 
The Hispanics are very musically inclined. 
There are musicians who play in the Spanish mass — several 
guitarists, and some drums; a guiro (gourd, a rhythm instrument) 
player joined them about a month ago as well. 
Every Sunday the 
Spanish mass has music; Fr. Jose "seems to be inclined to a 
musical mass," and sings the prayers and responsorial parts of 
the mass; "it's very seldom said" (as opposed to sung).

(005) 
G—Hammonton; 11GT Among the Hispanic community there is 
not a sense of identity with the Pinelands; Mele'ndez believes 
they are not really involved. 
He himself knows little about it, 
outside of an awareness of some of the restrictions imposed. 
One 
reason, he thinks, 
is that the Hispanics are not really involved 
in building houses that much, because of their financial 
situation, so that they don't really come up against the 
Pinelands regulations which have to do with building. 
(017) 
Most of the Hispanics' use of the public lands 
is 
confined to the "swimming, fishing parts of 
it." 
Very few hunt. 
In the summertime, they use the Bass River facilities for 
swimming and fishing. 
It 
is quite a ways from Hammonton, over 
near Rte. 9. 
The use the Hammonton area lakes for swimming and 
fishing as well, and some go out deep sea fishing, though they 
are few. 
The activity that involves the greatest number is 
fishing. 
Bass River is more used than any; 
inlets 
in between 
Hammonton and Bass River are also fished. 
People fish for Bass, 
Pike, Sunnies; there's some crabbing also. 
Mele'ndez himself is 
not a fisherman; he gave 
it up a long time ago. 
Quite a few men 
go crabbing, mostly on an 
inlet near Bass River. this reflects 
fishing customs in Puerto Rico as well, where a great many people 
live from the sea, and mariscos Iseafoods7 are a mainstay. 
Puerto Rico is a small 
island, where you're never far from the 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 65 
ocean. 
People who live around the ocean literally live from it. 
Fishing is a big activity in Puerto Rico, and so people keep 
it 
up here, too. 
(054) 
There are still some cockfights around this area, 
though they are illegal here. 
In Puerto Rico it 
is legal, and 
it 
is "one of the big sports down there." 
A "Sunday there is church 
and cockfights." 
They also "still keep all 
the tradition on 
domino playing" here 
in Hammonton. 
The Club has domino games, 
and several people also get together to play dopminoes and eat at 
each other's homes. 
The sport that involves the most people 
is 
softall. 
"Baseball 
is our sport." 
There used to be a Hispanic 
team in Hammonton, which played in the Vineland League, which was 
all Hispanic. 
Mele'ndez sponsored the team a couple of years. 
Vineland League had teams from Vineland, Woodbine, Hammonton, and 
Landisville. 
There was a team put together from Hammonton this 
year, though they are no longer part of the League, but the team 
dissolved before the season was out. 
Sports are also running 
into 
legal complications, because of new insurance regulations, 
and that leads to expense; this is happening to everybody, 
notjust the Hispanics. 
Also in Hammonton, there are insufficient 
facilities for baseball and softball. 
The school facilities 
require special permission from the school board in addition to 
insurance; 
the town itself doesn't have enough parks to 
accomodate everyone interested inplaying. 
Finding a place to 
play becomes a hassle. 
This was one reason that Hammonton joined 
the Vineland league, because Vineland had more facilities which 
were more readily available. 
They also used Winslow for the last 
4 or 5 years because they had a little park, and 
it was easier to 
get permission from Winslow than from Hammonton to play there. 
The Hammonton team used the name of their sponsor; the last one 
that Mele'ndez remembers was LP RECORDS, named after the shop of 
their sponsor that year. 
That's the name that goes on the 
uniforms. 
(102) 
Mele'ndez has his own business as well, 
in Winslow. 
It 
is a tavern. 
The sponsor buys the softball team's uniforms 
and has his name on them. 
At the time Mele'ndez sponsored them, 
the name of his business was Farm Tavern. 
Now he owns his own 
building, which he built in 1975. 
At that time he changed the 
name to Freddy's Capi—Q Tavern. 
This is a pun in the term 
"capicu", from the game of dominoes; the term refers to a play 
in 
which your last domino can be played at either end of the line. 
This play 
is called "capicu" and 
is worth extra points in the 
scoring. 
"It means you win on either end." 
Freddy was 
Mele'ndez's Anglicized nickname in his first job after graduating 
from high school. 
He worked as a stock clerk and delivery boy 
for a small grocery store, and the owner complained that the name 
"Fernando" was too hard to say — and in those days, 
it was 
unusual around there too so Mele'ndez adopted "Fred" as his 
sobriquet. 
It has been one of his common names ever since, and 
he even calls his son Fernando "Fred." 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 66 
(125) 
It 
is not uncommon for people to have an English 
nickname for a Spanish name, "to make it easier for people to get 
to know you and to identify you." 
People will also have a 
Spanish nickname as well. 
It 
is a very common practice among 
Hispanics to have nicknames, or apodos. 
Mele'ndez' nickname from 
childhood was Nandi; his brother Angel Manuel was nicknamed 
Manolo. 
It is also common to nickname kids, "for anything 
really; whatever they looked like when they were born." 
I.e., 
if 
they were small, they may be nicknamed "Chico" or "Tito"; one 
friend of Mele'ndez, at 34 is still called "Topo" (a die, one of a 
pair of dice), because he was so small when he was born. 
Other 
people may adopt animal nicknames, such as "Culebra" (snake), 
"Pichon" (bird), "Gato"(cat, this one "because of his blue 
eyes..."). 
The nicknames are used "among ourselves," and nobody 
gets offended by 
it. 
Mele'ndez calles his wife "Neva" (little 
girl) and she calls him "Nene" (little boy); or he might call her 
"Negra" (black woman) "which means Negro, but yet its a way of 
expressing, a pet name, sort of." 
"That's 
very common with the 
Hispanics." 
(163) 
The tavern 
is a part—time business for Mele'ndez. 
He 
is employed full time with the Board of Education in Edgewood. 
The tavern 
is an investment that he started 15 years ago. 
He 
gets home from his regular job about 4:45, and by 6:00 he goes to 
the tavern to open up. 
He'll stay there a few hours, or until 
"whatever the limit is" 
if there are people there. 
It 
is 
on the 
back roads, so the clientele are mostly regulars, not to many 
drop—ins. 
If business is slow, he closes up: 
"You can't just 
sit there and wait for people." 
He has an Anglo and a Hispanic 
clientele, though the majority are Hispanic. 
Conversation is 
in 
both Spanish and English. 
There 
is a significant group of 
Hispanics who do not speak Spanish. 
Especially the younger 
generation; they might have command of Spanish, but feel more 
relaxed speaking English, because it 
is the language of their 
everyday lives. 
(212) 
Mele'ndez is not familiar with the Presbyterian 
church's Hispanic minister or congregation. 
Most of the 
Hispanics in the area are Catholic; there are also some Jehovah's 
Witnesses. 
There are no santeros that he knows of 
in Hammonton, 
though 
"I believe there's one 
in Vineland." 
In Hammonton, there 
was "a lady that used to practice it at a low level," but she's 
not around any more. 
Anybody that has any use for that now will 
go to Vineland. 
Santeria was big 
in Puerto Rico when Mele'ndez 
was a child; he remembers it well, though his family never used 
it. 
"It's like a witch doctor kind of thing", 
in which people 
simply have different beliefs, and "in some areas they are right. 
You can't say they're 100% wrong, because they're not." 
He knows 
of cases in which the doctor has failed to effect a complete 
cure, but a Santero has had better results. "Now, I can't say 
that man 
is wrong; he only knows how he feels." 
"That is big in 
the Hispanic countries." as 
is Espiritismo. 
Mele'ndez doesn't 
doubt that there are people with some kind of "God given power", 
Blair 83--Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 67 
but he personally wouldn't seek their aid. 
This is common in 
Americans as well, not just Hispanics. 
Mele'ndez does not condemn 
the belief, even though he doesn't share it.
