They Say It Is a Sin to Flirt
THEY SAY IT IS SINFUL TO FLIRT
Grady Wiley Arvin, 1941
Oh, they say it is sinful to flirt They say that my heart is of stone And they ask me to speak
to him kindly And leave the poor boy alone.
Oh, why do they call him a boy I'm sure he's much older than me Why don't they let us
alone How happy we would be.
I remember last night when he said He loved me better than life And he called me his
darling his own And asked me to be his wife.
Oh Willie, I said with a sigh, I feel that I have to say no And I gave him my hand with a
smile And told him that he must go.
Oh Katie, Oh Katie, he cried, It's true that your heart is of stone And he tuck the white rose
from my hair And left me standing alone.
Next morning they found Willie dead, Deep down by the stream by the mill, And in clear
sparkling water so cool, That flows from the foot of the hill.
His blue eyes forever was closed, And damp was his golden curly hair And in his lips so
sweet Was the rose that he tuck from my hair.
Oh Willie my darling come back, I'll always be faithful and true to you. â€¦
