David RiceNarragansett BayOh, well do I remember my boyhood's happy hoursThe cottage and
the garden where grew the fairest flowersAnd [another?] sparkling [?] on whichWe'd hunt so gay
all the [way before the gentle gale?] [ 3 check ?] I'd I had a dear companion but she's not with me
nowThe lily of the valley is waving o'er her browAnd I am sad and lonely a-weeping all the dayFor
bright-eyed laughing little Nell of Narragansett Bay.Go toll the bell at early dawn of dayFor lovely
little Nell so quickly passed away.Go toll the bell so soft and mournfullyFor bright-eyed laughing
little Nell of Narragansett Bay.I loved this ? I loved that little beauty [?] it was my prideAnd hand in
hand together we'd join [ on?] the foam to rideShe'd laugh in tuneful melodies to see the waves go
byAs [wild and?] furiously the wind and the sea was the sky. ? Through Though tempest gathered
o'er us and all was dark and drearWe loved the great old ocean and never dreamed of fear'Tis years
since our sweetheart days ? But here are we todayOh, bright-eyed laughing little Nell of Narragansett
Bay.Go toll the bell at early dawn of dayFor lovely little Nell so quickly passed awayGo toll the bell
so-soft and mournfullyFor bright-eyed laughing little Nell of Narragansett Bay.One day from us she
wandered and got into the boatThe cord was \ quickly loosened and with the tide afloatThe Arrow
bounded unheard and darted through the sprayWith bright-eyed little Nell of Narragansett Bay.Next
day her form all lifeless lie washed upon the beachI sat and gazed upon it bereft of sense and
speechA year since we parted but still I weep todayFor bright-eyed laughing little tell of Narragansett
Bay.Go toll the bell at early dawn of day.For lovely little Nell so quickly passed awayGo toll the bell so
soft and mournfullyFor bright-eyed laughin laughing little Nell of Narragansett Bay
