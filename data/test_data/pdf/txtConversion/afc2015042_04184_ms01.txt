Summary of  Interview / Event: 
Atlanta-born and Fitzgerald, Georgia-raised, John Edward Benoit discusses his trajectory from a college 
business major, with minimal farm experience, to the Director of Livestock for a multi-species 150-year old 
Georgia farm that is pioneering rural re-development through its agricultural and business practices. John 
discusses the transition from a cattle ranch to a multi-species farm and the technical, physical, social and 
mental agility needed to do this kind of work.  
Interview Log: 
0 00 38 John Edward Benoit introduces himself and his role at White Oak Pastures (WOP). Born on 
November 24, 1990 in Atlanta, he is currently the Director of Livestock (but he calls himself the livestock 
manager) overseeing the plants and the farm. Of his three managers, one oversees the hogs, another the small 
ruminants like sheep and goats, and another poultry.  
John distinguishes between an animal husband, a livestock manager, and a director of livestock. As director, 
he oversees all species, whereas managers each oversee an individual species. They come to John when they 
have problems or issues, so he is “literally all over the place,” moving rapidly between species, one hour with 
chickens, another with hogs and another with cows. 
Cattle, old cracker cattle, have always been on the farm, but over the years, different bulls were brought in for 
breeding. WOP’s herds are closed now, and the farm has bulls, but no steers. We don’t castrate. 
As WOP was traditionally a cattle farm, he discusses the introduction of other species. “With the pigs, the 
farm started with Tamworths, Berkshires and Old Spots all heritage breeds that have bred together creating 
our own White Oak breed of pig that does well on the land.” John describes the other breeds raised at WOP. 
0 03 08 WOP wants an animal that does well on the land and that adapts to the region and climate. This is 
distinct from many growers who want a particular breed irrespective of what their land offers or requires. 
“Let an animal be an animal,” John says of how he manages livestock.  
0 04 19 While he oversees all breeds, John’s primary focus is cattle. Instead of having a cattle manager, he and 
Will (Will Harris, WOP owner) act as a cowboy team checking the cows’ defenses, doing daily chores 
(providing water, minerals, making sure the animals “look” good—with physical appearance being a key 
indicator of health), repairing fences and planting forage. “When you raise cattle, the main thing you’re 
actually doing is growing grass. Without grass, you can’t have cows. When we have a dry spell, as now, we 
bring in hay and keep the cows up tight, just on 300 acres…We’re always planning for the future.”  
0 06 07 John discusses his daily movement of the herd, which depends on pasture conditions and herd size. 
One big herd can be 2500 animals. Cattle need shade and adequate water for they drink a lot. Those in one 
pasture in the morning are moved to another by evening. 
0 06 55 John started at WOP in 2012, but his appreciation of the farm began in the summer of 2011, when 
he was in his senior year in college, dating Will’s daughter Jodi, and visiting the farm on weekends. Before 
there was a formal internship program at WOP, Will suggested that he join the farm and “work all the 
departments… “Seeing the chicks arrive one day, watching them grow, and then slaughtering them in the

plant showed me the full circle of life…” and, he says, provided him with an overview of how all aspects of 
the farm work. 
0 08 27 John discusses some of the professional and life experiences that prepared him for the job of 
livestock director. “Being around animals was important to me.” John describes raising show pigs as a child. 
And, although he didn’t raise chickens, he grew up in Fitzgerald, Georgia, which he calls the Home of the 
Wild Chickens. “When you park your car to get groceries and come back, there’s a rooster on your roof….” 
That integrated life of farm animals and people made the transition to living and working at WOP easy. John 
discusses his grandfather’s business and the construction and engineering work he helped him with that also 
trained him for his current job.  
John shares his educational background — he says he ironically didn’t think he was smart enough to study 
agriculture and instead, he went to Valdosta State University and worked towards a degree in business 
management, intending to be an entrepreneur like his grandfather. “…But then I came here…and even 
though I had four classes remaining, Will offered me a full time job running chickens…” surprising John who 
said that he “had never raised a chicken in my life and here I am about to run a multimillion dollar chicken 
operation with 18 employees…But the transition was good because I had spent a summer working with the 
guys in the field and had their respect.” 
0 11 34 John shares that his workers didn’t see him as ‘the guy who dates Mr. Will’s daughter’ because they 
sweated together.  
0 11 52 In 2013, pigs arrived at WOP. John describes starting the swine program with 30 Berkshires, 8 
Tamworths, and 25 Old Spots, noting that the operation has grown to 600 to 700 pigs, including Iberians 
from Spain, which have distinct needs and growth patterns. 
0 13 11 American swine love to root, John says. They dig deep so if you put them on pasture they will leave 
holes. So we give them tree line access where we want them to root and have them clean out the briars. We 
put the pigs where we need them to work, which they do — like bulldozers. Iberian pigs, on the other hand, 
don’t root but graze like sheep. John discusses spending two weeks in Spain learning how to raise Iberians and 
bringing that training back to WOP. 
0 15 36 John ends by describing the practice of animal husbandry, which is all that one does with animals. 
“They need you for basic food and water. If you’re not there, they will perish.” 
00 15 50 On practicing animal husbandry… “You are their provider…all of our employees are really good 
about having that bond…When it’s January and it’s 30 degrees and pouring down rain, almost snowing it 
takes a lot to get out of bed and say, ‘I’ve got to be in this for ten hours.’ It takes a special person who has the 
get up and go and not see a person the rest of the day, you’re just there with the animals…Then this time of 
year, we’re battling heat. It can be 105 degrees out there and we’re putting in 14, 15-hour days, sun-up to sun-
down…so it takes a special person to do it.” 
00 17 27 On finding co-workers for this hard work and why the culture of White Oak Pastures, which he calls 
an organism, keeps good people there — seven days a week sunrise to sunset…we’re a family. 
00 20 27 On a typical week…I wake up in the morning and I don’t know what the hell I’m going to do. I can 
tell you what my goals are and I have a To Do lists, but I’ve got a notebook in my truck and I’ve got notes 
from last year — you can flip through there — and I’ve still got shit on there that I haven’t done. Problem 
solving is my number one thing I have to do…  
00 21 53 On communicating by bumping into each other, texting, and calling on cell phones with his fifty+ 
employees

00 22 59 One minute I'm a vet, next minute I’m a plumber, next minute I’m a meteorologist…On problems 
say we’ve got an orphan — it’s mama didn’t want it…so we take it to be bottle fed until we can put it back 
with the herd… 
00 24 15 On the radical changes in the past five years, from the chicken processing plant to the restaurant…in 
ten years we may be raising flamingoes…. 
00 25 03 On what he likes…nothing is the same every day. I like changing. I like to be challenged…I used to 
have hobbies, I used to back in the day…If it’s Sunday at 3 o’clock and I’ve got nothing to do, I’m not going 
to sit around and watch TV, I’m going to ride around…because it’s a lifestyle and I love it… 
00 26 15 On his relationship with the processing facility…coordinating calf weights…will I have some ready 
next Thursday…I have 20 sheep that need to be killed, gone away from the herd…they’re at their prime…
they way you’ve got to think of it, when that animal is at its prime for processing, all you’re doing when you 
go past that point is just wasting money. Any grass that animal eats is just grass taken from another… 
00 27 56 on the chute that helps him assess target weight, sending animals to the plant…on how to 
coordinate chicken readiness for processing…a daily communications challenge for once a chicken reaches 
four pounds, it’s considered oversized and not many people want it…because our chickens are athletes…
running from eagles…and they develop muscles…you’re going to go from having a nice tender chicken to 
something you’ll have to put in a crockpot…so we’ve got a peak window 3.5 to 4.5lbs and when that chicken 
is in that window, it’s time to pop the head off and go in a box…some weeks it could be that I don’t have 
birds to kill, that rain two months ago hurt us real bad…or it could be, Hey, I’ve got a thousand birds that I 
had no idea would be at weight and they’ve got to be killed…or these birds are small but we’ve got birds 
coming out of brooder that need this infrastructure… 
00 30 47 On packaging and marketing the animals and how his work with the animals goes hand-in-hand with 
the work that Jenni does selling…because he doesn’t always know what people will buy and needs to know…
she tells me what people want and I tell her what people can get… 
00 32 30 On the original family farm land and how it has been growing…On the first 230 acres they 
purchased and on getting hungry for land and for growing more good food…On how the type of land they 
purchase informs how they revive the soil and which animals they put on it…and examples of how 
introducing multiple species regenerates the land while providing additional revenue streams.  
00 40 21 On opening up the finances for each manager so they can understand the whole system and how 
that has created retention 
00 41 48 My office is my truck — a Ford F250. I’m outside all day long for the most part. I’m so backed up 
on emails and paperwork…it’s all about prioritizing stuff…and late nights…then there’s a jeep I use to get 
through the pastures…I can go a lot faster… “Everybody calls me The Hardware Store on wheels because IF 
you need something, I’ve got ten of them. There’s nothing more aggravating than going to fix a busted pipe 
and along the way you’ve got to fix two gates and something else broke and then someone flags you down…
for you to say yes, I’ve got it, but I’ve got to drive five miles back to go get it…so you just keep everything 
with you. 
00 45 45 On co-workers and pulling guys from the cutting room into a day when he needs to move cattle…or 
if they’ve got a big order and something broke, I’ll send my guys down… 
00 47 08 On this type of work being around in the future…without farmers, there’s no food. Without food, 
there’s no people…On the practices of conventional ag and tensions in society about which direction 
agriculture will go in…
