DEAR ONE OF OUR DREAMS. 
Written by W. IL DELEHANTY, for H ALEY and W EST. 
OH, we have just come out, for to tell about 
A 
darling little fascinating creature ; 
She's a 
lovely girl, just as pure as pearl, 
Like a 
fairy she does seem. 
We shall ne'er forget the day when first we met, 
'Twas on a 
pleasant afternoon in summer, 
When among the flowers, amid Cupid's bowers, 
Sat the dear one of our dreams. 
She's the beauty of the dell, 
Is this queen, this fairy belle, 
'Twas one afternoon, amid the sweet perfume, 
Which the roses and the violets were shedding, 
There amid the flowers, in Cupid's bowers, 
Sat the dear one of our dreams. 
We stood there amazed, yes, in fact, quite dazed, 
At the beatity of this fascinating creature ; 
We could only stare at her face so fair, 
As enraptured we stood there. 
When the balmy breeze came floating through the trees, 
And tossed about her hair so lovely, golden, 
Then our hearts this girl quite away did whirl, 
She's the Dear one of our Dreams. 
She's the beauty, etc.

ONE day while walking down Broadway 
I 
met my cousin Joe, 
lie asked we then if I 
with him 
To Central Park would go; 
1Vith my consent we then did start, 
And reached the lake at three, 
We took a 
sail, and words of love 
IN ere pass'd by Joe and me. 
crionu.s. 
Sailing on the lake, 
To the music of the birds, 
The rippling of the waters, 
And the sound of loving words. (
Repent.} 
On our return we took a 
stroll, 
And soon did reach the mall, 
When from the distance music sweet 
Upon our ears did fall ; 
We sat and listened to the band 
Beneath a 
hawthorn tree, 
While gentle breezes carried words 
Of love from Joe to me. 
Sailing on the lake, etc. 
Now Joe has asked me to be his, 
Of course I 
won't refuse, 
And pa has given his consent--
This chance I 
must not lose ; 
And when some day at Central Park 
The lake you go to see, 
I 
know you'll whisper words of love, 
Like my dear Joe and rue. 
Sailing on the lake, etc. 
CLOVER. 
Written by W ALLY W EST, and sung only by HALEY and W EST. 
HAPPY is my 
lot, for in yonder little cot 
Dwells a 
darling, charming little maiden, 
She's an angel from above, my little turtle dove, 
And with love for her my heart is heavy-laden. 
The last time that I 
saw my love, 
She promised me to wed, 
Oh, she's so sweet, and so complete, 
She's turned this darkey's head. 
CHORUS. 
When this girl does marry me, 
Sorrow will be over, 
Then we will so happy be, 
And this little fig will always live in clover. 
This maiden whom I 
love all other girls above, 
Is the sweetest little girl in all creation, 
-With a 
rosy face so fair, and wavy golden hair, 
She possesses every art of fascination. 
She loves no one but me, and mine some day she'll be, 
I'll be happy when the wedding day is o'er, 
Then when I 
can call her wife, we shall lead a 
merry life, 
In joy and bliss, ecstatic evermore. 
When this girl does marry me, etc. 
Written and sung by JAMES BRADLET. 
No doubt you've heard of the Active Boy, 
Also the Lively Moke, 
But I've got one that's full of fun, 
You will see l'm not telling a 
joke ; 
It's all about this nigger here, 
And of my funny ways, 
how I 
sing to please the folks, 
That's the way I 
pass the days. 
I'm my parents' only joy, 
They say I 
am their dancing boy, 
Twist my heel like any eel, 
Jump up high and down again ; 
The neighbors think I'm awfully wild; 
My father calls me his darling child ; 
Indeed it's so I'll have you know, 
I've got it on the brain. 
To balls and parties I 
always go, 
Whenever I 
get the chance, 
I 
take my gal, her name is Sal; 
Around the room we dance. 
When the hall is over, 
It breaks up in a 
fight ; 
The fiddler breaks his fiddle, 
While the committee all get tight. 
I'm my parents', eta. 
ALABAMA TWINS. 
W ritten by W ALLY WEsr, and sung only by HALEY and WEsr. 
-W E'RE a 
pair of liver-colored coons, 
As gay as gay can be; 
We're twins, and look so much alike, 
You can't tell hint front me. 
Good dancing and sweet singing 
Will please the gloomiest folks. 
We are adepts in both, you see, 
Two lively little mokes. 
CHORUS. 
For so easily we glide, 
First we jump and then we slide; 
Just watch us for awhile, 
As the music now begins, 
And note the graceful easy style 
Of the Alabama Twins. 
We nigs are lively as can be, 
We sing the whole day long ; 
And as we sing, our feet keep time, 
To the music of the song. 
We're just as happy as two larks, 
The merriest little pair 
That ever tried by dancing 
To drive away dull care. 
For so easily, eta.

The babies in twos and threes, 
Came into this world of trouble, 
And when they were twins, 
Upon my pins, ---
My work it was always double. 
I'd carry them upside down 
in terrible desperation, 
My mother would frown and say: " you clown 
You're bringing on strangulation !" 
CHO: —Johnny don't wriggle the baby, &c.

The babies I 
had to feed 
With an infant's feeding-bottle, 
And still as they smiled, 
grew so wild.— 
The darlings I'd like to throttle. 
I 
nursed till I 
grew a 
man, 
it was a 
public scandal, 
A 
mangle we had, it was too bad; 
I 
nursed while I 
turned the handle. 
Cuo:—.Johnny don't wriggle the baby, &c. 
3 
To shuffle this nursing work, 
I 
managed at last to marry, 
But now it is wuss, 
I've still to miss,— 
And several babes to carry. 
'When broken of iiihtiv rest, 
In vain to the babes I 
chirrup, 
To silence each pest, I 
must invest 
In a 
gallon of soothing syrup!

LONG AGO. 
Negro Character Song, by W ALLY W EST. 
IN a 
lowly little cabin down in dear ole Georgia State, 
Is where this nigger was bred and born; 
And happily I 
passed away my childhood's golden hours, 
A 
hoeing of the sugar cane and corn. 
I 
used to pick the snow-white cotton, aud ole massa's often 
' 
said 
He had no better working hand than me; 
But now I've left the dear old home, ole massa too is 
dead, 
Those happy days again no more I'll see. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
wish they'd come again, those good old days of yore, 
Us niggers never thought of care and woe; 
We had no cruel overseer to drive us on through fear, 
In those happy times in Georgia long ago. 
Oft us little folks would gather round our dear old mother's 
knees, 
At night when all the niggers' work was done ; 
Ah, how often I 
have sat here, 'neath the fragrant orange 
trees, 
An' watched the happy niggers in their fun. 
Then as years passed on I 
older grew, and learned to 
speak of love, 
In that same old-fashioned way we all do know, 
As we wandered arm in arm, 'neath the shining stars 
above, 
In those happy times in Georgia long ago. 
Oh, I 
wish they'd come again, etc. 
OLD POMPEY THE FIDDLER. 
Sung by HAnnts and Canama.. 
HE.—Old Pompey the Fiddler play 'd 
a 
rare tune, 
And a 
merry old darkey was he ; 
His rosin was good—his stout bow of the best, 
And .his break-down was something to see. 
He'd always a 
grin and a 
hearty laugh 
Whenever his door you would pass ; 
His fiddle was always tuned up for the dance, 
And ready for each lad and lass. 
CHORUS—BOTH. 
There was Sam and Bill, Dinah and Nell! 
They merrily sang all day ; 
And cheerfully we would join the spree, 
For that was this darkey's way. 
SHE.—Old Pompey was handsome. He never would IN ed, 
Yet the wenches he loved passing well ; 
And the reason he gave was of all the dear sex 
Which he liked best he never could tell. 
The Pays, the Sallys, the Susans, and Fans 
So bothered old Pompey's soft heart, 
A 
bachelor free he resolved to be, 
And never from his fiddle part. 
BOTH.—There was Sam and Bill, etc. 
HE.—Old Pompey jogg'd on in his usual way, 
And play'd for the folks round about, 
Till, meeting one day a 
sweet colored girl gay, 
The sweet damsel upon him did pout. 
SHE.—Her bonnie black eyes took him so by surprise 
He asked her if she'd be his wife. 
She, grinning, said " Yes," and he gave her a 
kiss, 
And now she's the plague of his life. 
SPOKEN.—Yes; and we all danced at old Pomp's wed-
ding. 
CHORUS—BOTH. 
There was Sam and Bill, Dinah and Will ! 
They merrily danced all day ; 
And cheerfully we did join in the spree, 
For that was this darkey's way. 
SEE THAT MY GRAVE'S KEPT—. 
Sung by HALEY, W EST, and SPARKS BROTHERS. 
W HEN I've passed in my cheeks, little rosebud, 
When I'm six feet under the turf, 
I'll forgive, you though you took me for a 
sucker, 
And played me for every penny I 
was worth ; 
You said I 
might " look, but I 
musn't touch," 
And " you put me in quite a 
dilemma," 
But there's one little sn ap which I 
wish you would fake up, 
That's to see my grave is whitewashed every summer. 
Oh, the days will come to you, poison face, 
When you'll think of how you back-capped me when I 
was living. 
Clean the snow off my grave with a 
pitchfork, will von, 
darling ? 
And decorate my grave with turkey breast, Thanksgiv-
ing ? 
Don't get cranky when I 
ask you to remember 
flow you used to give me taffy on a 
stick; 
With your dizzy jokes you nearly paralyzed me, 
But, my darling, you can't say I 
ever kicked ; 
I 
will in:et you in that everlasting " By and By," 
Tra la lee, skip the sofa, you're my baby. 
Plant huckleberry trees on the next lot to me, darling, 
And see that my grave is kept shady ; 
Oh, my name will soon be Dennis, sweet Aleena. 
When you had a 
dollar I 
always stuck to you, 
Get a 
host of volunteers to play some kind of music, 
And soc my grave is kept red, white and blue. 
As sung by TON Y PASTOR. 
BEHOLD 111 Me a 
jolly card, 
I've sweethearts by the score, 
A 
secret I 
will tell to you, 
There's one whom I 
adore. 
I 
nightly take her for a 
walk, 
We stroll among the trees, 
While the moon is brightly shining 
We wander at our ease. 
CHORUS. 
In a 
shady grove, all among the trees, 
While the moon is shining, you stroll there at your ease, 
With your sweetheart on your arm, on a 
summer's night, 
Telling tales of love, while the moon shines bright. 
We often wander to the spot 
Where Nell and I 
first met ; 
'Twas on a 
lovely summer's night, 
I 
never shall forget. 
What brought me there ' tis hard to say ; 
But Cupid will beguile ; 
I 
lost my heart when first I 
met 
My Nelly by the stile. 
In a 
shady grove, etc. 
My charmer's hair is raven black, 
Her eyes they are dark blue, 
Her face it always wears a 
smile, 
I 
love this girl so true ; 
She seems to fill my soul with joy, 
With her I 
could not part, 
She is my guiding star through life, 
Dear Nelly, my sweetheart. 
In a 
shady grove, etc. 
Now shortly I 
intend to buy 
A 
little golden ring, 
To join my lover's heart to mine, 
With joy how I 
shall sing ; 
The wedding bells will then peal out, 
Their music it will tell 
The girl I 
love is made my bride, 
My charming little Nell. 
In a 
shady grove, etc. 
SINCE TERRY'S LEARNED TO DANCE. 
Written by W ALLY W EST. 
OR, ye've all heard tell of my Tgrrenee, 
For of him I've often sung, 
And he's always in some sort o' trouble, 
Though 1 'spose that's the way with the young. 
Sure, almost every evening, 
Round the kitchen floor he'll prance, 
He wakes all the neighbors wid his noise, 
An' says he's learnin' how to dance. 
CHORUS. 
I 
know I'm going crazy; 
For I 
don't stand no sort o' chance, 
Oh, I'm going to the divil intirely, 
Since Terry learned how to dance. 
He puts on a 
pair of wooden shoes, 
That makes his foot look like a 
log; 
He stands there shakin' them half an hour, 
An' calls it a 
Lancashire clog. 
An' then he's got another pair o' shoes, 
I 
guess they're full two feet long. 
c 
Sure, he throws them up, and slaps them down, 
Au' calls it a 
dance an' song. 
I 
know I'm goin' crazy, etc. 
Sure the other day he took two tubs, 
An' fixed up the divil's own rig ; 
An' he stood on the top o' the two an' danced, 
An' called it a " pedestal jig." 
At the very first step, sure, the pile fell down, 
An' giv' him the heartburn in the bosom of his pants. 
Sure, his clothes is wrecked completely, 
Since he's learnin' how to dance. 
CHORUS. 
Sure, Mary Ann's gone crazy, 
'Cause she don't stand no sort o' chance, 
Her trada-la-loo's gone out o' date 
Since Terry's learned to dance.

THE GERMAN'S DEAD CHILD. 
Written and Recited by Gus WInufats. 
You yonder vy I 
look so sad, 
And vy my hair yos gray, 
Vich vas so plack vone year ago, 
But listen vot I 
say. 
I 
had a 
darlin7 leetle shild, 
Und Peder VOS his name. 
But now he's gone from me—he's dead, 
Und in the cold grave lain. 
" 
Aly vife Adele also is dead, 
Und buried in de earth; 
I 
can't forgot de time she died 
'Dwas giving Feder birth. 
Und how I 
yatched dot shild grow ub, 
'Till he first vent to valk; 
Und oh ! how glad vas my poor heart, 
I-en he first learned to talk. 
Dot shild was everyding to me, 
Und yen de lire so wild 
Had burned me oud of house and home, 
I'd still left me my shild. 
Und I 
vos habby, doucrli de glouds 
Looked heavy, dark and dim, 
Und yillingly I 
vorked me den, 
Because DI left me him. 
THE GERMAN'S DEAD CHILD.—Continued. 
Und I 
vorked hard, and soon I 
had 
All dot I 
wanted of vealth, 
Yen all at vonce my darling shild 
Began to fail in health. 
Und I 
did pray unto my God, 
in accends dot were wild, 
To dake me if lie wanted to, 
But blease to spare my child. 
Dey say dot God is merciful, 
Und " doeth all dings well ;" 
At any rate my Feder died, 
Dot child I 
loved so veil. 
Und here I 
am, a 
poor olt may, 
Alit wrinkles on my prow, 
No vone to bless or comford me--
Oh ! I 
am lonely now. 
Fader, molder, all are gone, 
Also my darling wife ; 
But sdill I 
could have outlived dot, 
If He had spared vone life. 
I 
only trusd vhen I 
am dead, 
Und Heaven has on me smiled, 
Dot first to velcome me up dere, 
Viii be my dading shild. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
THE great men of the day they sing 
About their West End belles, 
Of " Oxford Joe " and " Polly " too, 
And noisy, howling swells ; 
But I 
will sing of another sect, 
And please you, if I 
can ; 
And the one I'll mention in my song 
Is the honest workingman. 
CHORUS. 
For we are not " toffs " or " Immensikoffs," 
And none of the " Upper Ten '-" 
But we bel ong t
o a gl
ori
ous band, 
They call the workingmen. 
Some pride themselves upon their wealth 
And stations high in life ; 
A 
married match they always hatch 
Whene'er they take a 
wife ; 
But if true love and virtue should 
.Be recorded in the plan, 
Why, as good as any countess, boys, 
Is the wife of a 
workingman. 
For we are not " toffs," etc. 
If misfortune should at any time 
Bring the rich man down ; 
He stands as helpless as a 
child 
To brave the world's cold frown ; 
While we instead can earn our bread 
With hard but honest hand ; 
So, to speak the truth, what lord or duk:-. 
Can equal the workingman ? 
For we are not " toffs," etc. 
Some time the great and rich 
Will at the poor man sneer ; 
But where would be their grand estates 
If workmen were not near ? 
So I 
will hold my head erect, 
And say, " Thank God, I 
am 
Old England's boast, from coast to coast, 
The British workingman, 
For we are not " toffs," eta. 
SWEET MAGNOLIAS. 
Written by W ALLY W EST, and sung only by " Les Grotesques Be-
centrique," HALLY anti W EST. 
Ix a 
cosy little cabin down in Georgia, 
Where the cotton flowers blossom fair and white, 
There dwells a 
lovely little girl 
Who is my heart's delight, 
And at night when little stars were peeping, 
And the moon in all her glory shone above, 
I've often talked in happier days 
With this one sweet girl I 
love. 
CHORUS. 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom, (Syn.) 
How I 
love their sweet perfume, (Sym.) 
While walking through the scented groves of orange, 
'Neath the calm and silvery light of the moon, 
I 
told my darling of my love, 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. 
Now I've wandered far away from sunny Georgia, 
That dear old land I 
love to call my home, 
Yet oft my dreams will take me back, 
As through the world I 
roam. 
There I 
see the pure white blossoms of the cotton, 
As they glisten 'neath the calmly shining moon ; 
There's where I'd like to live and die, 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. etc.

BANNER SONG. 
Written and sung by Gus Wrusems. 
M
ERE is a 
foreign country proudly resting from its strife, 
That is mighty on the land or on the sea ; 
Its sons are true to freedom, to justice and to right, 
And its recard is a 
bright one, you'll agree ; 
1 
sing of that old country, of the dear old Fatherland, 
That is precious to its sons o'er all the earth; 
And its memory vill grow dearer when they oft and proudly 
think, 
That to Frederick the Great, their land gave birth. 
Then here's the flag of Germany, 
It waves o'er good and true, 
Long may it float in peace, beside 
The Red, the White and Blue. 
Music—" 
Die Wacht dem Rhine. 
There is a 
little island that is known unto you all, 
And its banner I'll unfurl unto your gaze ; 
A bright and glorious emblem that you'll recognize at once 
As the banner of its bright and better days ; 
The sunburst and the shamrock shall yet over them prevail 
In that dear little isle across the sea, 
And no power of might or right shall dare that flag assail, 
For in tlme that little isle shall be set free. 
Then here's the flag of Ireland, 
And blessed be every fold, 
Her sons shall spre id it to the breeze, 
As powerful as of old. 
Music—" The Harp that once through Tara's Hall. 
There is another country that I 
now will sing about, 
And I'm sure you'll concide with what I 
say ; 
She has helped our nation nobly, when she needed help the 
I 
ost, 
But her glorious sons have now all passed away ; 
lithouzh beaten in the late ‘var, she will be herself again, 
And show the world how great then she can be ; 
No king or queen shall rule her, no matter what they say, 
For like America she ‘vill be free ! 
Then here's the National Standard, 
That now floats over France, 
Iler Government is wide awake, 
And keen as any lance. 
music.—" 
Mameidaiae Hymn," 
There's another little island that is struggling to be free, 
From the tyrants and oppressors who rule there ; 
She's an honor to the New World, and an ornament besides, 
But her troubles, they are more than she can bear ; 
Her oppressors are a 
brutal set who do not recognize 
The law which God has given to us all, 
But murder and cold butchery they deal to every one, 
And that little isle for help does on us call. 
Then here's the flag of Cuba, 
Down trodden though she be, 
But Uncle Sam will soon send aid, 
And give her liberty. 
Music—" 
Cuba Shall be Free." 
There is a 
foreign country far beyond the rolling sea, 
With its castles and its power on every hand ; 
It has great men in its councils, and of (-rood men not a 
lack, 
And a 
language that we all can understand ; 
She's a 
great and mighty nation, though her faults we can't 
ignore, 
But the founder of our Union came from there ; 
So while we honor her great power and her noble sous of toil, 
Yet we trust our love of justice she will share. 
Then here's the flag of Emdand, 
And while it long shall wave, 
May we ne .er fail to love the land, 
That to us Shakespeare gave, 
God Save the Queen." 
There is still another country that is dear to every man, 
Who should love his brother ever as he ought ; 
It spreads the name of Liberty, where there is human life, 
'Tis the flag that was with blood of heroes bought ; 
Her doors are always open to the suffering and oppre,sed, 
Who may there in peace and plenty speed the tight ; 
Her defenders are the patriots, who of freedom know the cost, 
For the banner they will ever gladly fight. 
Then here's our National Emblem, 
The Flag that Ft eedotn won, 
And those beneath it dearly love 
The Laud of Washinaton. 
Musie—" The Star Spangled Bannw."

DARK 
EY'S HOLIDAY. 
Sung by Ilkunts and Ceuttom.. 
HE. 
I 
LOVE the Southern clime, where this darkey was born, 
I 
love the dear old time, each was a 
happy morn ; 
With joy we worked all day, at eve we joined the dance ; 
Each dusky belle, so beautiful, could kill me with a 
glance. 
I 
tuned my old banjo, and struck the tambourine ; 
We sung the old time music as we capered round the 
green. 
The good massa would join, our fun would never rest ; 
Those days will never be forgot, within this darkey's 
breast. 
CHORUS.—BOTH. 
Dancing on the green, dancing on the green ; 
Joyful darkeys we, when (lancing on the green. 
Strike the old banjo, strike the tambourine ; 
That's the fun I 
loved, dancing on the green. 
SHE. 
They say this nigger's free ; yes, free to want and pain, 
I 
would much rather see those good old times again, 
When through the cotton field I 
wandered with old Joe ; 
But those good times will ne'er come back, those days of 
long ago. 
It makes my old man smile, he thinks of those sweet 
hours, 
When me with love tales he'd beguile, amidst those sunny 
bowers ; 
But cheer up, dear old man, through life we've done our 
best, 
We'll pass out like the sunlight, when it dies in the west. 
CHORUS. —BOTH. 
Dancing on the green, dancing on the green; 
Joyful darkeys we, when dancing on the green. 
Strike the old banjo, strike the tambourine ; 
That's the fun we loved, dancing on the green. 
TO-NIGHT WE SAY FAREWELL.

OH 
! 
sing to me one song of thine, 
One song before we part ; 
The voice that angels stoop to hear, 
Must soothe my aching heart. 
Oh ! let it be a 
gentle song, 
Replete with love innate ; 
Such as the golden robin sings, 
To win an early mate. 
(Repeat two last lima.) 
'Tis true, when lovers meet to part, 
When breasts with sorrow swell, 
Sweet music lends her cheery voice, 
And helps to say " farewell !" 
We've met our last, perhaps for years, 
To-night,we bid adieu ! 
Our fondest hopes of timely bliss 
Have vanished like the dew. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Then sing to me a 
song of joy, 
One song before we part; 
That I 
may bear away with me 
Thy music in my heart. 
I'll kiss thee as thou warblest on, 
A 
token of our love ; 
And leave thee, till we meet again, 
In care of Heaven above. 
(Repeat two lad lines.)

M OST ev'ry lady has a 
beau 
She thinks the best of all, 
And doats upon him night and day, 
Tho' he be short or tall; 
She'll speak about his black mustache, 
Or else his curly hair, 
And kiss his " photo " now and then 
Because he is so fair. 
SPOKEN.—That " 
photo " business may be all right, but no 
paste- board kissing for Inc. 
It's too much on the half- shell 
principle, and borders a 
little too far on the ridiculous. 
For 
myself, I 
prefer the genuine, original, " Dawn East " smack, 
that goes off like a 
pop-gun every time it falls on the real arti-
cle—a 
pair of ruby lips—that's Inc. 
CHORE'S. 
For I 
prefer the genuine, 
The real old style of " smack," 
The one that's scented sweet with love 
And goes off with a " whack." 
Some take their follows by the hand 
While they are out to walk, 
And think themselves in Paradise 
When he begins te talk ; 
She'll say " ' tis pleasant since the rain," 
He'll answer, "' tis quite cool," 
And off they wander hand in hand, 
Like children going to school. 
SPOKEN.—Catch me and my fellow on that string and you'll 
catch eels edgeways— the weather has always been the stereo-
typed topic of conversation with the majority of moon- struck

"THE WAY TO KISS IN STYLE."—Concluded. 
lovers, and it always will be. 
Why not talk about the stock 
market, financial fiascoes, monetary matters, bulls and bears, 
or even pet poodles. It's just as sensible, and far more interest-
ing than weather lingo. 
Old Probabilities can attend to the 
weather question and spoony lovers should drop it. 
Then, 
when they get to the garden gate after a 
short ramble, they, of 
course, want to kiss. 
He's afraid, and she darsn't ; and they 
finally part by throwing one at each other. Now, if I'd been her, 
and the chap was worth it, I'd let fly one of this kind. (
gives 
isaitation of a 
healthy smack.) 
CHORUS. 
For I 
prefer the genuine, 
The real old style of " smack," 
The one that's scented sweet with love 
And goes off with a " whack." 
I 
have some lady friends who say, 
When beaux have bade " good- night !" 
" 
Just wait a 
moment longer, dear, 
Oh, do not leave my sight." 
Then they will take their lover's hand, 
And hold it for a 
while, 
And all the kissing that they dc) 
Is just a 
parting smile. 
SpoKEN.—This may be well enough for those who like it, but 
give me something better. 
What does a 
fellow care for a 
little 
squeeze like that, and. the outside door half open? Some would 
call it rather " tart," and several whom I 
know wouldn't stand 
it. 
The fellow that comes to see me— that is, one of them— fares 
better than that, and don't he like it, though ; just before he 
steps out I 
put them to him right srvart. and the beauty of it is 
be retaliates. 
CHORE'S 
For we prefer the genulne, 
The real old style of " smack," 
The one that's scented sweet with lore 
And goes off' with a " whack."

You may call me sweet and pretty, 
Tell me I 
am " so refined I" 
You may say my disposition 
Is the purest of my kind; 
You may praise the hue and sparkle 
That you witness in my eye, 
But your worship will diminish, 
You'll forget me, by-and-bye. 
CLIORI7S. 
You may call me sweet and pretty 
Woo me with a 
gentle sigh; 
But your worship will diminish, 
You'll forget me, by- and-bye. 
You may say I 
am " perfection," 
Say you love to see me smile, 
You may tell me that you love me, 
Tho' you're jesting all the while; 
You may whisper loving pleadings, 
Woo me with a 
gentle sigh, 
But your vows like chaff will scatter, 
You'll forget me, by-and- bye. 
You may; etc. 
You may ask my hand in marriage, 
Name, perhaps, the wedding day, 
You may say that you will take me 
On a 
journey far away; 
You may give me precious tokens, 
And my virtues glorify, 
But your promises will wander, 
You'll forget me, by-and-bye. 
You may, etc. 
MABEL GRAY. 
Written by W ALLY W EST. 
Sung only by " Les Grotesques Ec-
centrique," HALEY and. W EST. 
IN 
a 
lowly little cottage on a 
streamlet's mossy shore, 
There lives a 
little maiden whom I 
ever shall adore; 
Like a 
bird within the wildwood she is singing all the 
day, 
My sweetest dreams of childhood are of little Mabel Gray. 
CHORUS. 
She's the sweetest little creature ever seen beneath the 
sun, 
Her bright and winning ways make her pe of every one; 
Joy and sweetest pleasures linger round the cottage all 
the day, 
This earth it seems like heaven when with little Mabel 
Gray. 
Where I 
met this little charmer I 
know I 
shall ne'er for-
get, 
Her bright sweet smile still shines on me, I 
think I 
see 
her yet ; 
Her vision haunts me in ray dreams, it's near me all the 
clay, 
I've found at last my heart has gone to little Mabel Gray. 
She's the sweetest little creature, etc. 
DON'T GET WEARY, CHILDREN. 
Sang with great success by JOHNNY ROACH. 
OH, Johnny, you've been a 
bad boy, 
For to treat your true love so, 
And if you don't behave yourself, 
Ell let the old folks know. (
Repeat.) 
ononrs, first. 
Don't get weary, don't get weary, children, 
Don't get weary, for I's a-going home; 
Don't get weary, don't get weary, children; 
Don't get weary, for I's a-going home. 
CHORUS, second. 
When the sun rise in the morning, 
Down by the yellow corn, 
There we darkeys all take warning, 
When Dina blows the horn. (
Repeat.) 
CHORUS, third. 
When I'm gone you'll miss me, 
When I'm gone you'll miss me; 
There is one kind heart will miss me when 
I'm gone, yes, when I'm gone. (
Repeat.) 
Oh, Susie, I've been a 
bad boy, 
But I 
won't do so any more, 
And if you give me your heart and hand, 
We'll go to the old Virginia shore. (
Repeat.) 
Don't get weary, etc.

MOTHER, is the old home lonely, 
With no children left you there, 
And no one to guard thee only 
Him who hears the humblest pray'r 
Do you miss the many faces, 
Miss their love- kiss on thy brow, 
Loving hearts and warm embraces, 
Is the old home lonely now 1 
CHORUS. 
Is the old home lonely, mother I 
Lonely to you night and day ? 
With your children, one another, 
Wandering so far away. 
'Mother, is the old home lonety, 
With no voices bush'd in pray'r, 
And no little footsteps only 
Making music ev'rywhere 
Happy hearts that lived to cheer you, 
And your cup of bliss tc fill, 
They may never linger near you. 
Is the old home lonely now ? 
Is the old home, etc. 
#0. 
Mother, is the old home lonely, 
As you think of other days, 
When kind hearts around thee only 
Linger'd still to speak thy praise? 
You are growing old and weary, 
Marks of sorrow on your brow; 
And the days must be so dreary. 
Is the old home lonely now 
Is the old home, eta. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT. 
Sung by HARRIS and CARROLL. 
DAR'S a 
pretty little spot down in Southern Tennessee, 
Whar de ivy blossoms twine around de door. 
And ever fresh and green in our memories it will be, 
Though we know we'll never see it any more. 
But we never can forget the old home we loved so well, 
And the many good old tunes that we have sung; 
And the tears they fill our eyes every time we try to tell 
Of the times we used to have when we were young. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, de tambo and de bones are forever laid away, 
And de fiddle and de banjo am unstrung; 
But we often heave a 
sigh for de happy days gone by, 
And de times we used to have when we were young, 
When de autumn days had come we would husk de yaller 
COrn 
In de fields, we were a-singing all de day, 
For before dey made us free we had never cause to mourn, 
And around the old place everything was gay. 
And many, many times, when de work of day was o'er, 
With our melody de old plantation rung; 
And our hearts do often long for the happy days of yore, 
And times we used to have when we were young. 
Oh, de tanabo, etc. 
GIVE HIM ANOTELEM CHANCE. 
TIES world's a 
cold and selfish one, 
As many thousands know; 
Who once w
. 
ere blessed with hope and joy', 
But now are fallen low; 
Whose hearts were ever kind and warm, 
Nor turned from grief aside, 
But always lent a 
listening ear 
When pain and sorrow sighed. 
Then let us aid their sad distress, 
For we like them perchance 
May crave the favor of the world, 
To give us another chance. 
We cannot search their breaking hearta, 
To know the ancmish there, 
But kindly acts may heal their smart, 
And soothe their sad despair; 
For many whom you meet to- day, 
In sorrow broken down, 
Possesses hearts as kind and true 
And noble as thine own. 
Then do no not turn away from them 
With cold and haughty glance, 
But lift your fallen brother up, 
And give him another chance. 
The riches of the world were made 
Not for a 
selfish end, 
But that we generously might spare 
Some for a 
suffering friend. 
No matter what the faults may he 
Concealed within his heart, 
To save the wretched erring one 
Is a 
true and manly part; 
Then when you see a 
fallen man, 
With sorrow in his glance, 
Don't crush him farther in the dust, 
But give him another chance. 
THINGS THAT OUGHT NOT TO BR 
Written and sung by GEORGE HARRIS, the great Motto Singer 
How strange are the things that we meet with each day ,: 
As we go thro' the journey of life. 
Some are wishing that single they'd been by the way, ) j I'VE sung about dot Schweitzer kase, 
And some they go in for a 
wife. 
In Europe the people each other do kill. 
Why don't they come here and be free ? 
Let the emperors and kings do the fighting themselves; 
'Tis a 
sight I 
would much like to see. 
Is it right that some people should dress in their silks, 
And from this world's SO1TOW be free, 
While others in tenement-house3 should. starve ? 
'Tis a 
thing, sure, that ought not to be. 
Is it right Mr. Bergh by a 
bull-dog should stand— 
Should feed it with food of the best--
While the poor hungry folk., that do beg at our door 
Are in want of both shelter and rest ? 
Is it right the rich man who gets drunk on his wine 
Should get clear when his fine he does pay, 
While a 
poor starving wretch who ten dollars can't catch 
To the island must go quick away ? 
Is is right a 
pawnbroker who takes in your coat, 
And to lend a 
few dimes does agree, 
Should charge twenty cents for hanging it up ? 
'Tis a 
thing, sure, that ought not to be. 
Is is right out in Utah, where Mormons do live, 
That wives they should have by the score, 
While we, in New York, by the law are kept down 
Just allowed to have one, and no more ? 
Is it right that a 
parson should show us the way 
A " short cut" unto glory to reach, 
While he, on the sly, every pleasure does try, 
And don't practice at all what he'll preach ? 
Is it right a 
policeman should rough use his club 
'When a 
pcior, forlorn Creature he'll see, 
And bow low to the man who can " tip " him a 
bribe ? 
'Tis a 
thing that ought not to be. 
DISAPPOINTED DUTCHMAN. 
Written by W ALLY W EST for MODE'S and FIELDS. 
Dot krout and lager beer, 
Und now I'll sing about my gal. 
To me she's very dear; 
She is the sweetest Deitcher gal, 
Dot ever you did see, 
Und often I 
have heard her say 
" 
Oh, Jokey, I 
love thee." 
Oh, don't I 
love dot gal ? yes, you bet my life I 
do, 
Und I 
will make her my wife; 
Den so happy we will be, mit de kinder round our knee, 
We'll_ be happy all my life. 
Oh, dot's de vay I 
used to clink, 
Before dot I 
got wed;. 
But I 
changed my tune in 'bout a 
week, 
When I 
got me a 
broken head. 
My frau she hit me mit a 
tub, 
Und almost broke my jaw, 
I 
done a 
funny fall clear down de stairs, 
Und a 
million stars did saw ; 
She scrubs me mit de floor, und bangs me mit a 
door, 
Dot angel I 
call my wife, 
I 
wish I 
wasn't wed, ober else dot I 
was dead, 
For I 
am sick of dis life.

ALL GETTING MARRIED. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
BEHOLD in this mortal a 
poor single man, 
Who wanders about all the day, 
No one in this world cares a 
jot about me 
As long as my lodgings I 
pay; 
I 
away s 
was shy, and often would cry 
If any young girl winked at me; 
But, to tell you the truth, all the friends of my you 
They are all getting married but me. 
CHORUS. 
The birdies that fly, the pigs in the sty, 
The fishes that swim in the sea, 
The mice and rats, the dogs and the cats, 
They are all getting married but me. 
Oh, it makes me feel awful when I 
look around, 
And think of the days that are gone; 
I 
see my old " pals " walking out with their girls, 
While here I 
must wander alone ; 
I 
often have a 
doubt and want to find out 
Whatever the matter can be ; 
The haddocks and whales, the frogs and the snails, 
They are all getting married but me. 
The birdies that fly, etc. 
There is only one thing in this world I 
can do, 
That i, for to cross the wide sea, 
Join Brigham Young, and a 
Mormon become, 
Then, perhaps, much more happy I'll be ; 
But it seems very queer that there is no girl now here, 
I 
fancy they could take to me ; 
The sparrows and wrens, the cocks and the hens, 
They are all getting married but me. 
The birdies that fly, etc.

W ALTZING IN THE MORGUE. 
Banjo Solo. 
Written by W A.LLY W EST. 
NEW subjects now are very scarce 
In this advancing age; 
If a 
man should strike a 
new idea, 
They'd have him in a 
cage. 
However, I 
shall run all risks, 
And as I 
go along, 
You'll see that I've struck something new, 
In the title of my song. 
CHORUS. 
L'Tis waltzing in the morgue,in the dim and dusky twilight, 
With stiffs all around, laid out on the ground, 
vision fair, which charmeth the eyesight ; 
It's pleasanter by far, than oyster canning a 
dog; 
ly chiefest delight on a 
warm summer's night, 
Is waltzing in the morgue. 
I 
Called one evening on my girl, 
And asked her to a 
ball ; 
She is a 
daisy too, you bet, 
She's just about six foot tall. 
She wears a 
number sixteen shoe, 
Her foot looks like a 
log; 
You should see her dainty slippers, when 
She's waltzing in the morgue. 
CHORUS. 
Whirling around with Charley may be very fascinating 
For young damsels fair, with bright golden hair, 
And bosom fair, with joy palpitating ; 
But pleasanter far to me, as I 
never was known as a 
hog, 
Is with my sweet girl, as madly we whirl, 
While—waltzing in the morgue. 
THE DINNER DELL. 
Parody oil " The Water Mill." 
By By COLLINS expressly for ITALEy and WEsr. 
IirsTEN to the Dinner Bell ; 
At 12 o'clock each day 
.How the boarders shout " Hurrah," 
To the dining room hurry away. 
The proprieter looks so pale and sick 
As they all sit down to eat, 
And though looking, yet he cannot tell 
1Vhich one his board will beat. 
Here, pass that " Union butter," 
One of them boarders said. 
If the mill can never grind 
We don't get any bread. 
What a 
hardened hungry lot 
These boarders seem to be, 
How they grasp and gormandize 
Most everything they see; 
They were never known to stop, 
Unless they had their fill, 
Often coming hack again 
To that corn- beef 
; 
Truly speaks the landlord, 
" 
Ary clothes are fading fast; 
I 
cannot wash my Ulster 
In the water that has past." 
( 
1 
1 
" 
Take this lesson to yourselves, 
But don't take anything Lore ; 
Pay your board, leave my house, 
Or I'll fire you out the door. 
You want your trunk, I 
want my money, 
I've trusted you enough; 
I 
know you well, you can't fool me, 
And say my turkey's tough; 
Go to the Black Hills and dig for Indians 
You may come back in silk; 
But the mill can never grind 
With the water that's in milk." 
Oh what waste in a 
boarding house, 
What bills you have to pay ; 
A 
dead-beat will come back again, 
'Cause he " couldn't stay away." 
Some will ask for a 
fire escape, 
And more an elevator, 
And want their dollar diamond rings 
Put in the refrigerator. 
Take this lesson to your hearts 
Before you bring in your trunk ; 
The coffee mill can never grind 
When the cook is on a 
drunk.

IN 
the Emerald Isle across the sea, 
I 
left a 
colleen fair ; 
She's beautiful and bright to see, 
With wavy golden hair. 
Her bright blue eyes of heaven's own hue, 
Like the sun at early dawn; 
Sure the only girl I 
ever loved 
Was my own sweet Colleen Bawn. 
CHORUS. 
Sure I 
love her as I 
love my own life, 
An' I'll soon go back an' take her for my wife. 
Oh 1 
her eyes are as bright as the dew 
On the-trees at early dawn; 
Let come what will, I'll love her still, 
My own Sweet Colleen Bawn. 
Sure many lands I've travelled o'er, 
And many beauties seen ; 
But none of them could half compare 
With my charming Irish queen. 
There's a 
spot in Erin dear to me, 
It's cherished in my heart, 
That's where she promised she'd be mine, 
And that we should never part, 
Sure I 
love her, etc.

A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS— MALE AND FEMALE. 
[Scene, a 
cottage. 
As the scene opens, the symphony of the 
song is played.] 
[Enter NANCY, from cottage.] 
NANCY — Oh, dear! I'm so lonely while my Jack's away. I 
had a 
frightful dream last night. 
I 
thought his ship went down 
pi a 
great storm, and he was drowned. 
I 
awoke crying such 
great big tears. 
Oh, how I 
long to see my darling! May be Ite 
has forgotten me by this time. 
They say a 
sailor finds a 
wife in 
every port. 
But I 
know he is true to his sweetheart, no matter 
where he may be. 
If he is safe he ought to be home soon, and I'll 
be as contented as I 
can till I 
can clasp in these arms my true-
hearted sailor boy. 
[Looking od7.] 
Why, as I 
live, that looks like my Jack coming 
down the road yonder! The same light step and merry face. 
It 
is my Jack! Oh, fin so glad! I'll hide, and see what he will say: 
though it is a 
shame to tease him. 
[Goes in cottage.] 
[Enter JACK, with slick and bundle.] 
JACK.—Well, may I 
be devoured by land sharks, if I'm not 
disappointed ! I 
thought my little Nance would signal me 'fore 
this. 
I 
wonder where she is ? I've been away on a 
long voyage, 
and it's hard lines not to see the lass I 
love the first to welcome 
me when I 
come ashore. 
She may be sick, though I'll be bound, 
though sick or well, she's true blue ! 
This is the snug little 
moorings that hold the trim- built craft that I 
love dearer than 
life. 
How I 
long to give her a 
sailor's welcome! 
[Knocks at door.] 
No answer? Not at home? Nancy ! Nancy! 
(Galling.) 
The house is as silent as Davy Jones' locker. 
Well, 
to pass the time till she comes .back. I'll sing a 
little song I 
made 
about her. 
Many a 
time I've sung it in my watch on deck, far, 
far out at sea. 
[NANCY appears at the window, but is unnoticed by JACK.] 
NANCY. —( 
asule.) 
lie's going to sing about some new sweet-
heart he's got! Oh, dear! (sighs.) 
NANCY LEE.—CONTINUED. 
. [ The symphony of the song is played and JACK sings " NANCY 
LEE." 
At its conclusion, NANCY enters, and JACK clasps her 
to his breast.] 
NANCY.—Jack, my Jack! 
JACK.— Nancy, my Nancy I 
NANCY. — Still true? 
JACK.-- True blue! 
NANcY.---And you'll never tlr,o to sea again 
JACKS—Never leave my darling again! 
NANCY.—Oh. I 
could dance for joy 
JACK. -- SO 
could I

THE YOUNG LADY WITH THE CURLY HEAD 
OF HAIR. 
I 
HAVE suelca lot of beaux, all eager to propose, 
But they're none of them approved of by mamma, 
And she keeps so strict a 
guard over me, that's very hard, 
For I'm fond of beaux, as all young ladies are! 
She will seldom let me out, for she knows they stroll about, 
In the hope that they will catch a 
glimpse of me ; 
91,t as by the house they go, through the windows oft they 
throw 
Little notes I 
read when ma's not there to sea. 
SPOKUN.—Which generally contains something to this effect— 
CIIORCS 
Are you coming out to- night, for the moon is shining bright, 
And the little stars are peeping here and there; 
I 
am waiting here in doubt, oil! are you coming out 
Little beauty with the curly bead of hair. 
There is handsome Harry Lee, who is deep in lovp, with me, 
Whom I 
met at cousin Henrietta's ball ; 
But mamma declares him poor, says he's courted gids befre,. 
And she will never speak well of him at al:, 
But he often passes by, and I'm sure I 
don't know whlr, 
But I 
at the open window sit and sew ; 
And my heart beats very fast, as be whispers going pat.t. 
In that voice of his so musically low. 
Are you coming out, etc. 
Then there's Frank, who apes the swell, still I 
like him very 
well, 
Though I 
look upon him only as a " beau ;" 
He will often wait about, pleading " Arn't you coming out," 
And declares it wrong of ma to treat him so. 
Then there's merry Philip Drew, he's a 
dear, but he's poor too, 
And so daring, not afraid of ma at all ; 
she's not deaf, so she must hear, when his voice rings out so 
clear, 
As beneath my window he will often call, 
Are you coming out, eta. 
If alone to walk I 
go, I 
am sure to meet a 
beau, 
Nearly crazed with joy to catch me out alone ; 
But there's one—I 
won't say who—of no consequence to you, 
Fond of me, and—well—my heart is all his own. 
He is handsome, good, but poor; that's a 
fault ma won't ignore; 
But it shall not make a 
difference with me; 
For—you needn't tell mamma, but some day we really are 
Going to run away to church and married be. 
SpoKEN.—Then there will be no need for any to say— 
Are you ^eming out, etr

COME to me closer, my darling, look once upon me again; 
Speak to me fondly and truly, tell me the cause of your pain; 
Did I 
speak thoughtless or chiding, did I 
your heart ever 
grieve I 
Don't keep the truth from me hiding—kiss me, and say you'll 
forgive, oh, forgive. 
No one but what have their failings, try to forgive and forget; 
And if you'll love me as ever, life will have charms for me yet; 
Say then again that you love me, never shall change while we 
live ; 
Just once again tell me, darling—kiss me, and say you'll forgive, 
oh, forgive. 
Ah, tell- tale smile, I'm forgiven; now are my troubles all o'er, 
Like Cupid's arrow it's driven thro' to my heart's very core ; 
Smiles breaking from you, my darling, thus ever smile while 
we live; 
Remember to err is but human, so kiss me, and say you'll for 
give, oh, forgive. 
DARLING ISABEL. 
Written by W ALLY W EST, and sung only by " Les Grotesques 
Eceentrique," HALEY and W EST. 
I'M always happy, gay and free, 
My heart's as light as air ; 
It's brimming o'er with joy and love 
For a 
maiden fair, 
With flashing eyes and teeth like pearl, 
And lips of rosy hue. 
She is, compared -with other girls, 
A 
diamond, tried and true ; 
I 
love her, and I've promised her 
Her name I'd never tell. 
I 
will not ; still, I've christened her 
My Darling Isabel. 
CHOBITS. 
My darling Isabel, 
The one I 
love so well, (
Sym.) 
The fairest flower that ever grew 
In a 
shady dell 
For being sweet, could ne'er compete 
With darling Isabel. 
On Sunday eve, at half-past eight, 
I 
go my love to see, 
Down by the little rustic gate, 
She's waiting there for me ; 
I 
take her arm, we stroll along 
Where the silvery moonbeams play. 
Beneath the shade of the greenwood glade, 
My love and I 
do stray. 
I 
love hey, and I've promised her 
Her name I'd never 
I 
will not ; still, I've christened her 
My Darling Isabel.

I 
see again the winding wall, 
The meadow, brook, and pool; 
But sweetest vision of them all, 
The lane that led to school. 
The birds are singing just as sweet 
Upon the chestnut-boughs, 
The youthful lovers, as they meet, 
Exchange the olden vows; 
I 
see the fields in verdant gown, 
And feel the breezes cool, 
That used to blow so gently down 
The lane that led to school. 
I 
see again, etc. 
The woods are ringing far and near 
With shouts of boyish glee ; 
The girlish voices that I 
hear 
Renew sweet youth in me , 
I 
hear the old familiar song, 
And see the crippled stool, 
While in my dreams I 
walk along 
The lane that led to school.

Only this favor, Willie darling, 
When at last you reach the far-off shore..

Since she gave me her blessing with a

Tell them I

Bring back the old folks, Willie; 
Tell them I

Promise you'll not forget it, darling, 
When you're far away, oh, Willie dear. 
tiay you'll remember, Willie darling, 
Give them this letter when you're far across the sea. 
Warm hearts will greet you, Willie darling, 
For you've always been a 
friend to me. 
There's one who can tell you how I 
love her, 
And soon she will meet me here, I 
know ; 
But bring back the old Wks, Willie darling ; 
God bless you wherever you may go. 
Bring back the old folks, etc. 
Write me a 
letter, Willie darling, 
When you are happy in the dear old home once more. 
I 
shall be dreaming of you, darling, 
Sitting in our little cottage door; 
And then, oh, how gladly will I 
greet you, 
For the old folks are coming back to me; 
But give me your hand, oh, Willie darling, 
love you wherever you mrty be. 
Bring back the old folks, etc.

ARMY SO GRAND. 
Music by JOHN BRAHAII. 
Published by G. D.-Ttussma. & Co., 126 Tremont St., Boston. 
a 
gay vivandiere, yes, a 
gay vivandiere, 
And the pet of the army so grand; 
I 
march to the drum, to the tune of the drum, 
And halt at our Colonel's command; 
In the light bivouac, round the camp fire at night, 
We sing in such-sweet harmony; 
Aye, bravo they shout, while the guard turn out, 
And join in the wild harmony. 
ClIORUS. 
Then mark time to the band in the army so true, 
In the army so fearless, so fearless, so true, 
Who fight for the right, regardless of might, 
And our banner the red, white, and blue. 
I'm joyous and free as a 
lark in the sky, 
And the life of a 
soldier adore ; 
The officers oft throw sheep's eyes at me, 
But a 
lad in the ranks I 
love more ; 
He's the pride of my heart, so nobby and smart, 
And the best in the regiment to-day ; 
When his time does expire then we will retire, 
Get married, and lice on half pay. 
SP:AtEx.—Not altogether on half pay, for he will have a 
nice 
litk cottane and farm, an I 
raise all our own vegetables ; but 
we will never forget our military life and discipline, when we 
used to—

And when the man aslte-,1

This is what I 
did. (Dance.) 
When I 
went to get married, my girl was straight and tall,

• 
Beware the first approaches of this stealthy foe, that cometh 
like a 
thief in the night. 
A change of drinking- water, unripe 
4'ruit, a 
debauch, a 
slight cold may be the first clutch of Fever. 
't can be guarded against and repelled by a 
timely use of 
Merlin's Health Granules, A person shouid never 
travel to the mountains, to the sea- shore, or on the ocean with-
out a 
supply. 
Doctors admit this fact, and they don't speak 
well of any medicine unless its merits are very great. 
DYSPEPSIA, the arch- fiend of misery and decay, can 
be cured effectually by a 
persistent use of Mer_in's Health 
Granules. Why'? 
Because these Granules go to the 
very root of the complaint. 
They not only drive out the fecu-
lent matter that clogs the avenues of the body, but they in-
vigorate and give tone to the digestive apparatus, and make 
healthful blood flow through every petty artery ; then comes 
a 
good appetite, arid good food insures a 
lasting cure. 
In the Cholera Years it was found that the first 
thing needed was to drive out of the stomach and bowels the 
noxious germs of the destroyer. 
Nothing is so effectual for 
this purpose as Merlin's Health Granules, for while 
they are very powerful for good they are harmless for evil. 
A child may take them in moderation, while they can be 
made to operate upon the strongest man. 
" I 
DON'T KNOW WIIAT AILS NE I" 
How often do we hear this remark. 
A man or woman grows 
weak, feeble, irresolute. 
As Hamlet says, " Mao delights not 
me, nor woman either." 
This feeling arises from many causes. 
Lack of exercise, loss of appetite, deep grief— all these tend to 
render the fluids of the body heavy, thick, sluggish. 
There 
was a 
health- lesson taught by the angel stirring the pool be-
fore the sick got any benefit from its waters. 
It needed action, 
vitalizing with pure air. 
This is precisely the effect produced 
by Meriilli 9§ 
Heattli Granules. The sluices arowleaned, 
and the nutriment finds its way where it is wanted and can do 
most good.

Such is the innocent and admirable com-
position of " M ERLIN'S HEALTH GRANULES," 
that their action is most gentle and grateful, 
while at the same time thorough and search-
ing-. They do not produce violent irritation, 
followed by increased torpidity; on the con-
trary, their action is tonic and permanent. 
The torpidity and loss of tone of the bowels, 
which so often occur in advanced age, will be 
remedied by these precious granules, thereby 
increasing- health and strength, and prolong-
ing existence.

MALARIAL FEVER. 
However doctors may differ as to the exact cause of this 
fearful disease, they all agree upon one thing, that poisonous 
atoms have found their \vay into the system. 
Common sense 
tells us that the \vay to cure this disease is to expel these 
poisonous atoms. 
This is effectually done by a 
free use of 
merun.,,s 
ricaler, Granules. Not only do they cleanse 
the bowels of the perilous stuff that to retain is fatal, but they 
restore the blood to activity, and make it pay frequent visits to 
the lung-:, where it becomes aerated and full of health. This is 
purifying at the fountain head. 
Where the source is clean the 
stream cannot be foul 
Good health and chills and fever of 
course cannot exist together. 
THE GOUT CAN BE RELIEVED, 
if not entirely banished from the system, by using Merlin's 
iiea:Cla Granule:* at the first intimation of an approach-
ing attack. 
The Grama:es prevent the formation of the 
chali.y deposits which, if allowed to become at all fixed, ren-
der the ,jint,-; 
titr, and make them work with dlfficulty.

Lave exactly the same effect upon the joints that 
grease has upon axles and wheels— lubricates the grating

that their action is most Arenile and s-rateful, 
while at the same time thorough and search-
ing. 
They do not produce violent irritation, 
followed by increased torpidity; on the con-
trary, their action is tonic and permanent. 
The torpidity and loss of tone of the bowels, 
which so often occur in advanced age, will be 
remedied by these precious granules, thereby 
increasing health and strength, and prolong--
ing existence.

DON 'T WAIT TILL TO -MORROW 
If you feel any symptoms of Jaundice or other complaints be-
ginning in a 
non- acting Liver. 
The bile is stopped, and not 
doing its duty. 
Soon follow torpidity, congestion, mor-
tification, DEATH. Take at once a 
full dose of Ater-
lin 9s 
Health Granules. That will stop the disease. 
NERVOUS DEBILITY 
is the curse of civilization. 
Luckily it can be cured. 
It pro-
ceeds from intense mental strain; from violating physical laws, 
throwing the reins on the neck of Passion. The body becomes 
impaired, the mind follows suit, then the weak body and the 
irresolute mind plague each other, and drive the poor wretch 
to mental imbecility ; but, as we have said, Nervous Debility 
can be cured; the diseased humors can be driven from the 
blood ; the stomach becomes strong and active, the heart 
bonnds to its work, the mind follows suit, black despair flies, 
health returns, not by any miracle, but simply by using the 
great remedy, Merlin's Health Granules. 
One box 
has been known to bring a 
poor wretch from the edge of the 
grave.

Von are either filled with Malarial 
Poison or there lingers ia your system the dire effects of an-
cestral indiscretions and the Mercurial Poisons never driven

failing remedy, Merlin'3 Health Granules, the poison-
ous atoms are expelled to give place to pure, strength-giving

“COME AND LET US REASON TOGETHER.” 
It has been well said that he that cannot reason is a 
fool; he 
that dare not reason is a 
slave; he that will not reason is a 
bigot. 
We do not believe, good reader, that you belong to either of 
these three classes, and therefore address ourselves to you. 
You will have noticed that every Doctor, after feeling the 
pulse, looking at the tongue, and ascertaining the temperature 
of the body, pauses for a 
moment's thought. 
Then he quickly 
asks, " Are your bowels regular? " 
This you will therefore 
notice is 
the very key-note by which he seeks to know 
whether you are healthy or diseased. 
By further questions in 
the same direction he learns the particular nature of the dis-
ease. 
But no odds how many different points he may wander 
o, he soo:3 re:urets lo the digestive organs. 
The disease may be most apparent in the lungs, the kidneys, 
the heart, the 1:ver, the head ; but it is always the bowels he 
treats as the salient point of disease that has to be first treated, 
hence the first medicine prescribed is a 
dose to act upon the 
organs of digestion. 
This is wisdom. 
The doctor knows that 
vrithout thorough ergestiou half the food taken is 
worse than useless. 
As certain things strewn around become 
incorporated whit the soil and nourish it (left in a 
compact 
heap they breed disease) so without an active digest ion food is 
hurtful. 
These are truths that no ,sano man will attempt to 
gainsay. 
What is the remedy 
Surely a 
medicine powerful 
enough to carry off all injurious matter, and at the saute time 
having such balsamic qualities as will heal any inflammations 
that may have arisen in the lining of the different ducts. 
Now 
the very best thing that can be used to do what all doctors 
recommend is Merlin's Health Granifles. 
Pleasant 
to take, easy in operation, and leaving_ lasting good effects after 
their use. 
This is homely, sound doctrine. 
Try, and be con-
vinced. 
Merlin's Health Grannie ,4 
do not ( ompete 
with any other aperient medicine; they simply extinguish 
them.
