Library in Stillwater, Oklahoma. 
Project Detail 
This project is supported by the Archie Green Fellowship of the American Folklife Center at the 
Library of Congress. 
The purpose of the Immigrant Women Artists Oral History Project is to examine the occupational 
folklife of first-generation immigrant women artists living in Oklahoma and the networks of 
support that allow them to pursue their vocations in a 
new environment. This series of interviews 
examines not only the cultural and occupational traditions that these artists nurture in straddling 
multiple cultural identities, but also the translation of an artist's occupational life between 
multiple cultural and physical spaces. 
Legal Status 
Scholarly use of the recordings and transcripts of the interview with Sarah Ahmad is 
unrestricted. The interview agreement was signed on January 15, 2021.

About Sarah Ahmad... 
Sarah Ahmad is a 
multidisciplinary artist and educator, currently in residence as a 
Tulsa Artist 
Fellow. Ahmad researches the interconnectedness of pattern across the natural world through 
study of recurring forms that are common to the human body, nature, and the cosmos. She 
combines these natural forms with geometric pattern inspired by Islamic art-making traditions to 
expose the inherent unity that underlies our existence, transcending geo-political boundaries. 
Ahmad's work draws on her own experiences of trauma and reconstruction. She immigrated to 
the United States with a 
degree in fine art from the National College in Lahore, Pakistan. She 
earned an MA 
in education specializing in arts education and following the breakdown of the life 
she built in the US, she earned an MFA, and forged her own path as a 
professional artist. Her 
work posits a 
future rebuilt from the wreckage of destructive experiences. It is an exercise in 
renewal: an artistic inquiry into universal identity and the human condition that transcends 
borders and the constraints of media. 
Since starting her MFA 
in 2013 Ahmad has maintained a 
robust exhibition profile, showing 
work throughout the US and internationally—from the Sharjah Art Museum in the United Arab 
Emirates, the Delhi Contemporary Art Week in India, and the Koel Gallery in Karachi, to the 
LuminArte Gallery in Dallas, the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, and the Los Angeles Center of 
Digital Art. Ahmad has given myriad artists talks, for example at Crowe Museum in Dallas and 
University of Memphis. She has produced public art projects for the Nashville International 
Airport, the Regional One Hospital in Memphis, as well as the Greenwood Art Project in Tulsa. 
Ahmad's work has garnered mention in national publications and media, including: the New 
York Times, artnet news, PBS News Hour, USA Today, Google Arts and Culture, and 
Hyperallergic. Internationally she has been cited in Dubai's Guy f 
News, and in numerous 
publications in Pakistan including The News, Dawn, Herald, Friday Times, and Youline 
Magazine. Ahmad is a 
recurring guest on NPR's Public Radio Tulsa. She has been accepted to 
successive artists residencies that have enabled a 
dynamic exhibition schedule, for example at: 
the School of Visual Arts in New York City (2017), the Vermont Studio Center (2015, 2017), 
and the Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles (2018). Ahmad has twice been nominated 
for the prestigious V&A's Jameel Prize, and the quality of her artistic research has been 
acknowledged through nomination to the eminent Joan Mitchell Foundation (2019), and receipt 
of numerous regional awards such as through the Oklahoma Visual Arts Coalition (2019, 2020). 
Ahmad's research focus has turned increasingly towards community engagement and socially-
oriented projects. Her current work as a 
contributing artist to the Greenwood Art Project 
commemorates the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This juried program, overseen by MacArthur 
fellow Rick Lowe and Guggenheim fellow William Cordova, took on national prominence with 
the groundswell of attention to racially targeted, state-sanctioned violence. Placed in a 
local 
nature preserve, Ahmad's contribution The American Dream invites the public to help convert 
3 
the entire preserve to a 
living memorial with iconographically-rich marigolds. Her work is 
continually sensitive to socio-political forces; Ahmad embraces the possibility of resurrection in 
the wake of destruction with a 
profound understanding of the need for sites of communal peace 
amidst the chaos of the world. In her own words, "I 
create aesthetic sanctuaries, offering spaces 
of collective healing."

Little Thunder 
This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder with the Oklahoma Oral History 
Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Today is January 15, 
2021. This is a 
remote interview with Sarah Ahmad 
for the Library cf 
Congress' OcciApational Folkl fe Prcject funded by the Archie Green 
Fellowship. We are both in Tulsa. Sarah, you received a 
Tulsa Artist 
Fellowship in 2019. Congratulations on that. 
Ahmad 
Thank you. 
Little Thunder 
I'm looking forward to hearing more about you and your work. Where were 
you born, and where did you grow iAp? 
Ahmad 
I 
was born in Lahore, Pakistan. I 
grew up in Lahore and immigrated to the 
US after I 
had done my undergrad college. 
Little Thunder 
Can you tell me what your folks did for a 
living? 
Ahmad 
My mother was a 
homemaker. She was a 
homemaker when I 
was growing 
up, and after all her children were married and had left, she became an 
educator and taught at a 
private school in Lahore. My father ran a 
government contracting business primarily supplying to the railways. 
Little Thunder 
How about your exposure to art growing iAp in your home or outside cf it? 
And that's any way you want to dcfine art. 
Ahmad 
I 
attended private all-girls schools, and art was not offered in the schools I 
attended. We had needle work at Sacred Heart School. That was a 
private 
Catholic school. Embroidery was the art form that I 
learned in school and at 
home. I 
learned sewing and embroidery and all sorts of needlework crafts. 
The one experience of art I 
did have in school was we had politeness lessons 
5 
that were taught by a 
German nun who was the head of the school. We had 
to illustrate each lesson in our politeness books, and one student got the 
prize for the illustrations at graduation. That was the only art prize that the 
school offered, and I 
got that prize. You know, when this interview came up 
is when I 
even looked back and thought about it. I 
had almost forgotten 
about that part of my 
life. We actually had these beautiful politeness books, 
and I 
spent a 
lot of time drawing and just loved doing it. There were no 
guidelines for it. It was just, however we interpreted illustrating those 
lessons. My other experience was the biology illustrations I 
did in high 
school. We had to draw diagrams of cellular networks, organs, and systems 
of the body that we were studying. For me, it became an art exercise. I 
spent 
a 
lot of time on these drawings, and I 
loved collecting images of cell 
structures and networks of the human body and plants and organs. 
Now, looking back, that was something I 
was really intrigued by and loved 
doing. Now if I 
look at my detailed drawings of cellular structures inspired 
by scientific imagery, I 
can sort of make the connection; that was something 
I 
loved doing, way back then in middle school and high school. The other 
exposure I 
had was at home to a 
variety of traditional arts and crafts. We had 
all sorts of hand-crafted objects like handwoven rugs and hand-carved 
wooden screens, beautifully carved silverware... patchwork or applique 
quilts and linens. Some of them were made by my mom, her sister, and 
family members. My grandmother used to design and sew the quilts for us. 
We had a 
collection of very rich fabrics that had everything from beadwork, 
embroidery, needlework, and all styles of hand work. My mom also had 
antique fabrics and jewelry that were family heirlooms. I 
think it was unique 
in the sense that my home environment was very visually rich with all these 
handicrafts. I 
think that definitely Pakistan is a 
country that's very rich and 
vibrant in arts and crafts and color and pattern. That stands out as a 
hallmark 
of the culture. That works its way into one's work without you realizing it. 
[00:05:12] 
Little Thunder 
Ahmad 
For sure. How did you end iAp at the National College cfArt in Lahore? 
National College of Art is the premier art institution in Lahore and South 
Asia. I 
had never heard of it. I 
discovered—NCA is short for National 
College of Art. I 
discovered NCA by accident when I 
came across it in a 
book in a 
library. That in itself was interesting because it was a 
library that I 
hardly knew anyone even visited. It's a 
mid- 19th century, Victorian style, 
really grand building that is located in these historic gardens. I 
came across 
NCA, and I 
immediately thought this would be fun and an escape from the 
drudgery that the education system felt like in Pakistan was at that time, 
with outdated textbooks not really engaging. This offered me an alternative 
that really fascinated me, that a 
college I 
had never heard of would be a 
new 
adventure. Art seemed like something that would be fun, something I 
would 
6 
love doing. That's how.... Then I 
remember that I 
brought it up with my 
parents and found out only later that NCA had a 
very scandalous reputation. 
It was a 
co-ed college with all sorts of liberal stuff happening in this private, 
enclosed niche. (Laughs) I 
think my family allowed me to attend because 
my aunt was an artist. She had graduated from Pratt Institute in New York in 
the ' 60s, and she was an influential person in my 
life. 
Education was also really important for my family because there's a 
long 
family history of my family being leading educationists and social reformers 
of their time, in the Indian subcontinent for generations. For example, on my 
mother's side of the family, one of the oldest universities in India that is also 
one of the largest even now and one of the most prestigious, Aligarh 
University, its first classes started at my great-grandfather's family estate 
home in the same room in which my mom was born. We used to spend our 
summers in Aligarh and found out about its history. I 
think I 
was allowed to 
attend because my family valued art and education. There was, a 
precedent, 
even though my aunt did not attend NCA, but she had a 
degree in art from 
Punjab University. I 
think what happened was that we had to take a 
life 
drawing test for admission. That was my first experience in, taking art 
lessons to learn any traditional art from and drawing. I 
took that test and got 
in and found myself at NCA. (Laughter) Initially, it was really, I 
guess, to 
have a 
good time. I 
grew up in a 
very sheltered, protected sort of household 
with no independent exposure to the outside world, so the whole idea of 
NCA was really exciting to me. (Laughter) 
[00:09:19] 
Little Thunder 
Ahmad 
What kind cf a 
base did you get there, artistic base? 
We had foundation drawing and painting and foundation art courses, and 
then we had to select our major. Mine was painting and print making. It was 
a 
four-year degree with art making as the main focus. I 
think one of the 
biggest impacts of that degree was the exposure to a 
different world, life, 
people, ideologies that I 
did not have at home because it was a 
very 
protected, sheltered upbringing. In college, not only did I 
love making art, 
but the work took me to explore the city in a 
different way that was not 
accessible to me before for art making, exploring resources, and getting 
things made. I 
was suddenly exploring parts of the city I 
had never seen 
before or experienced or would not find myself in if it hadn't been for the art 
degree. My 
professors included leaders of women's rights movement, 
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. There were peace activists and 
visionaries. Salima Hashmi, who is still my mentor, was a 
vice chair of 
Human Rights Commission, is a 
leading South Asian curator, educationist, 
social reformer participating in many peace justice movements. Lalarukh 
who the founder of the Women's Action Forum, was my professor. 
7 
I 
think it's just having these professors who were visionaries and being 
mentored by them that influenced me. Independent thinking, talent, and 
quality of work were respected. Another interesting thing was that I 
had 
attended private elitist all-girl schools. NCA was completely different 
because my classmates came from all over the country from villages and 
cities from different social, economic, cultural backgrounds, different 
regions of the country. NCA was a 
great equalizer. I 
was exposed to, you 
know, also diversity in that sense. I 
think the biggest thing was that I 
found 
something that I 
loved doing, an activity that I 
was good at and was having 
fun engaging in, but it didn't feel like work. I 
excelled in college. I 
was on 
merit scholarship for four years. The top four students in the entire class of 
hundred, or however many, get merit scholarships. One year I 
was first. 
Some years I 
was, like, third or fourth. 
I 
excelled at it, but it was just I 
was having fun. Finding that combination 
was a 
new discovery that education is definitely not drudgery. (Laughter) I 
think that what happened in that process was that in my final year, I 
had a 
really traumatic life experience, and my year was consumed by it at the 
time. All my peers were in the most intense phase of college, which is 
working towards the Thesis show, and I 
was barely hanging in there, really 
isolated. I 
graduated, and I 
applied for graduate studies to colleges in 
London, which is where I 
wanted to go. I 
got admission with scholarships, 
but I 
was married off and went to the U.S. with my husband. I 
think the 
foundation I 
got at NCA sort of stayed with me. I 
called upon that degree 
when I 
had to return to art making and the transnational training to get into 
the MFA program and start my art practice here. 
[00:14:02] 
Little Thunder 
So you ended iAp in Tennessee. Did you get to explore the landscape a 
little 
bit? There's some beautful country there. 
Ahmad 
Tennessee's definitely beautiful. I 
think landscape I 
explored more not when 
I 
moved here but years later when I 
was going through a 
divorce and started 
making art and attending Memphis College of Art. I 
think my landscape 
exploration somehow came at that period in my life. I 
moved there for my 
husband's fellowship in oncology at UT, and when we moved there, I 
enrolled in the MFA program at Memphis College of Art on a 
scholarship. I 
had two kids, and my husband didn't want me to work and didn't want me 
to pursue the degree in art at that time. We put our kids in daycare, and they 
both started falling ill really one after another, week after week. I 
had to stay 
at home with them. That's when my husband put his foot down, and he 
didn't want me to continue. I 
think my life initially was focused on building 
a 
family life at home and raising my children. Then the landscape 
immersion part comes later, but Tennessee's definitely beautiful... . 
Tennessee's so beautiful. Even though we lived in Memphis, I 
feel like 
8 
when I 
moved to Tulsa I 
had what I 
call the trees deprivation because 
Memphis feels like it's carved out of the woods. There are beautiful trees 
everywhere, and in downtown here I'm surrounded by concrete. I 
had to 
find places in Tulsa where I 
could go and find that experience of nature 
immersion. (Laughter) 
[00:16:04] 
Little Thunder 
Ahmad 
[00:18:20] 
Little Thunder 
Ahmad 
Well, you did describe a 
moment in some c 
f 
your interviews where art found 
you, and I 
wondered fy ou could talk about that. 
I 
thinkI was going through a 
divorce. My divorce took eight years, so it 
was a 
very traumatic period in my 
life. When my children had their first 
overnight weekend visitation with their dad when we were separated, that 
was when I 
found myself alone for the first time in life, something I 
had not 
experienced because I 
grew up in a 
joint family in Pakistan in a 
household 
full of people and had been a 
full-time mom. I 
hadn't been away from my 
children ever, except for literally two days when I 
was on a 
family trip with 
my mom. I 
was alone, and my uncle who lives in Rhode Island, he just 
challenged me to create a 
painting because he said, "Now you have the time 
and no one around to tell you what to do." (Laughs) That is what I 
did that 
weekend. I 
was surprised to find that I 
could still paint and draw after all 
those years. More than that, how my life struggles would find expression in 
the work in a 
really beautiful way because the paintings I 
created during 
those first few weekends, showed me that even when I'm at my lowest lows 
in life, really depressed and broken, I 
could create something beautiful out 
of it. It was almost like a 
moment of awe, that my life's meaning and 
purpose had been, up until then, through home, family, kids and without 
that, I 
wouldn't have an identity. This early work reminded me that I 
had a 
purpose beyond that role and it was something I 
wanted to explore and 
continue in. I 
saved those paintings, you know, to remind myself that I 
can 
always do this, even through whatever times I'm going through in life. I 
think that was a 
moment really when I 
went back to art. 
That's so cool. When you do get into graduate work in art, what kinds cf 
sul ject matter are you exploring when you first start your graduate work? 
When I 
first started graduate school, that was actually the most intense 
period of my divorce litigation. I 
was almost full-time going through that, 
and my husband was descending into schizophrenia. I 
had to literally save 
my children's well-being, their education. I 
think at the same time all these 
things were happening, I 
had all these other responsibilities and barely 
making it to graduate school for, studio work or classes. My graduate 
school, Memphis College of Art, is located in the Overton Park. The old 
9 
forest, which is 176 acres of forest, is in the Overton Park. I 
was really 
broken and going through a 
lot of trauma, and I 
went for walks in the forest. 
It just happened really organically, and I 
found this space for, sort of, refuge. 
A 
lot of my work started there, was set in the forest or had references to 
these arboreal forms and gardens. That became the subject matter of my 
work, but also in terms of the materials I 
was using in 2012, I 
had these 
beautiful screens carved in Islamic geometric patterns on one of my trips 
back to Pakistan. That is a 
tradition that is, prevalent in that culture of hand-
carved screens. 
I 
brought them back with me, and I 
had all these ideas of making beautiful 
artwork with it. I 
had these screens with me when I 
started graduate school 
in 2013. What I 
did was, because I 
think my life was so broken and I 
could 
not connect with making artwork the way I 
had envisioned, I 
broke the 
screens and randomly cut them up into pieces. Then I 
had a 
heap of broken 
pieces on the floor that was just like a 
reflection of my life that felt like a 
heap of broken pieces that I 
was getting buried in. I 
started reassembling 
those screens and making structures out of it that became installations. In 
that first semester, I 
made something like eight different installations from 
the same set of screens that I 
broke, assembled, reassembled, reconfigured, 
painted, cut them up in different combinations. That became a 
process of 
sort of rebuilding my life from these broken pieces and building a 
future 
from these destructed pieces, broken pieces of the past, looking at sort of 
resurrecting myself and transforming into, a 
new life or looking at hope or 
creating something beautiful. I 
think all my life experiences juxtaposed with 
my time spent in the forest. The other experience I 
had was, my graduate 
studio and later my apartment were two blocks from the Mississippi River. 
[00:22:15] 
I 
started going for river walks for sunset views. I 
discovered these gorgeous 
panoramic sunsets on the river that I 
had never seen before, these 180 degree 
views of sunsets because I 
lived in the city. On the other side of the 
Mississippi River is Arkansas that is swampland, so nothing is built there. 
You see the sunsets with this unimpeded view. That became my other 
escape, sky gazing, even going at night and just looking at the night sky and 
clouds and taking tons of pictures of sunsets and clouds. When I 
came back 
to my studio, I 
was working with the screen carvings, and so I 
started 
combining these painted cloud shapes with screen carvings. That became 
my seminal piece of immersive installation, the Groundless series that came 
about that later traveled nationally and internationally. Clouds became a 
metaphor for transcendence during these difficult times of trauma and loss 
and upheavals of life, transcendence into this space of my own, for creating 
a 
beautiful space where I 
could exist; a 
metaphor for freedom and 
transcending boundaries because clouds are liminal, just like screen 
carvings. The screen are perforated and just like the clouds, they blur 
10 
boundaries, exist in between spaces, and mediate light. Juxtaposing the two 
exposes the commonalties between two contradictory structures and is a 
reflection of my life and identity. 
It's a 
confluence of many disparate elements that come together in that 
work. The landscape of Tennessee and the place became the inspiration for 
my work, and I 
discovered the healing power of nature, which is what made 
me keep going back to it. It's not just the visual beauty and wonder and awe 
at, the beautiful landscape, but it's also the energy, the healing energy that 
you feel. You're in rhythm with creation, especially in these solitary 
experiences in the woods and when you're really immersed in nature. It's a 
nature preserve, humans have not intervened with that space. I 
think I, 
especially now after that, seeking outdoors experiences in nature became my 
refuge and a 
break from life, a 
place where I 
can feel regenerated. The 
impact of the landscape of Tennessee, initially was taking children to these 
beautiful lakes or parks, but later on it became much deeper. 
My work in college at that time was foundational because I 
developed these 
themes that I've continued to work on. It was in the confluence of all these 
elements that came together, reconstructing fragments and looking to nature, 
natural phenomena, bringing together an interest in craft and non-traditional 
contemporary media into this very contemporary mode of art making that is 
this large-scale installation that came about really organically. I 
think the 
innovation of that work is not evident now because many artists are doing 
this work with screen carvings of Islamic geometric patterns, but at that time 
in 2012 and 2013 when I 
first started working with carved screens, there was 
no precedent. It was the beauty of discovery and something really special 
about that experience. 
[00:26:59] 
Little Thunder 
Ahmad 
Yeah, how neat to know that you were one c 
f 
the first to start working in that 
area. You also did some teaching. You did end iAp getting a 
teaching 
cert ficate and taught art for a 
little hit. What did you get from your 
teaching, or how did that impact your own artwork? 
I 
love teaching, definitely. I 
am a 
licensed art teacher for visual arts, K 
through twelve, so before teaching at the university, I 
taught at public 
schools full-time while I 
was going through the divorce. I 
loved university 
teaching, as well. We lived in a 
small town in Tennessee where I 
first started 
teaching. While my children attended this all-white school and had endured 
many racist experiences, in the teaching community, in the schools I 
taught 
at, the public schools, they were very welcoming and supportive. I 
found a 
community of people that is just completely different from the conservative 
sort of racist Tennessee experience we had. I 
was teaching art full-time, and 
the schools I 
taught at ranged from this well-known school that had a 
long 
waiting list to the schools that were at-risk with 80 percent students on free 
11 
lunches. Those schools were almost, majority of the student population and 
even staff, predominantly African American. 
It exposed me to the ethnic disparities in the culture in a 
very direct way. My 
art supplies budget was less than a 
dollar per child per school year. I 
had 
twelve hundred students, so I 
was immersed in that community in a 
different 
culture. I 
was, at the same time, learning about all these societal racial 
politics and seeing it play out in these totally contrasting communities in the 
neighborhood where I 
lived, which was an affluent neighborhood and the 
schools where I 
taught. It became really fulfilling for me to be able to 
provide these experiences to these students, to teach art, and see that all of 
them can discover themselves and find empowerment through art. They 
were winning prizes and felt confident about themselves. It was just very 
fulfilling for me to take these students and see them go through this process. 
At the same time, I 
was yearning to make my own work, and I 
knew that if I 
designed my life myself and did not have these prescribed roles, then I 
would have done my MFA. 
[00:30:54] 
When I 
got my—you get an apprentice license when you first get the 
teaching license, and you teach for three years full-time. Then you get the 
professional license. As soon as I 
got the professional teaching license, I 
quit 
the teaching job and joined the MFA program because that was the point 
where I 
had job history and, you know, had worked and felt that I 
could go 
back to it to earn a 
living to support myself, that this is something I 
really 
have to do. The other thing was that I 
got a 
master's degree in education in 
Jackson, the small town we lived in, because when we moved after my 
husband finished his oncology fellowship and moved to Jackson, the 
university there only had MBA and master's in education. I 
didn't have 
access to an MFA degree. My children started preschool, so I 
was able to do 
the MA 
in education in a 
way that did not interfere with my family 
responsibilities when my children were starting preschool. My husband 
didn't want me to work after I 
got my professional license, so I 
wasn't 
teaching. 
Instead, I 
started volunteering at my children's school in art flings and 
festivals, committees, in their classrooms, and teaching about our culture 
because post-9/11, we were the only Pakistani American family in that town 
for some time. My children were the only ones from our cultural 
background; there were a 
couple of African American families at one point. 
At that time, they were the only people of color in their classrooms, of 
Pakistani immigrant background, so it was really important for me to dispel 
those prejudices xenophobic notions after 9/11 with people not being 
exposed to anyone from our culture. I 
spent a 
lot of time celebrating our 
cultural events in the classrooms, even taking books in Urdu and reading 
12 
them and translating them to the children to get them exposed to just 
listening to a 
different language. Then later on, it was in my school teaching 
experience, and I 
did a 
lot of that, introducing artwork from different 
cultures in my classes. Then after my MFA, I 
did teach at the university. 
Actually, after my MFAI 
did my MFA, finished and graduated in 2015, 
the same year I 
got divorced after eight years of divorce battles. I 
tried a 
number of different directions coming out of graduate school. I 
tried design 
but was immediately turned off by the emphasis on monetizing everything. I 
taught in a 
couple of places. I 
loved teaching, but I 
realized that teaching 
was really time consuming starting out when you're trying to build an art 
practice. I 
could not sustain an art practice while teaching starting out. 
Finally I 
decided that I 
was going to take the financial risk and make art full-
time, and that's what I 
started doing. That's when I 
started doing the series 
of artist residencies and did my solo show in Pakistan, my group show in 
Pakistan, the show at the United Arab Emirates, showed my work locally 
and nationally and moved to Tulsa for the Tulsa Artist Fellowship. 
[00:34:38]

Little Thunder 
Ahmad 
Did you go? Did you go, as well, with your exhibit? 
Yeah, yeah, I 
actually made the work there, a 
lot of the work there, and had 
made some work here. It's sort of made in both countries. Then after that, I 
came to Tulsa. 
Well, what was it like for you to get the Tulsa Artist Fellowship? 
The Tulsa Artist Fellowship came at the perfect time in my 
life, when I 
needed it for the next step in my art practice, to have the means and 
resources to continue on because it provides the financial security, housing, 
studio stipend. It takes that, you know, financial pressure off of you. Other 
than that, this was the first time I 
moved for myself, my 
life, and my career 
because we lived in Connecticut and Virginia for my husband's practice and 
his fellowship, residencies, and then in Tennessee. This was a 
beautiful 
experience because up here I 
found a 
community of artists. I 
found sort of 
another layer of my identity in this community. It's not just the community 
of artists but the diverse community. I 
had been in artist residencies and 
programs which were all nearly- all white. At my art college for example, in 
the MFA program there were two Iranian Americans in my first semester 
and two African Americans in my last semester, and I 
was in college for two 
and a 
half years. Otherwise, it was all white. The same for most of my 
residencies. 
The Tulsa Artist Fellowship is predominantly actually more people of color 
than the other way around. It's been really beautiful because I've been 
13 
exposed to the Native American community and artists from so many 
different backgrounds. It's done wonders for me on many, many different 
levels. I 
think not in terms of these opportunities but also in terms of my art 
practice that has become, is moving more in the direction of socially 
engaged and socially interactive projects and large-scale projects that I'm 
taking on; the fellowship has provided the resources and means to be able to, 
do this work. The other thing about Tulsa is that it's not just the fellowship 
but the arts organizations and arts community. All of them really support 
and welcome artists from diverse backgrounds. This is something really 
special that people don't know about Tulsa because they think it's 
Oklahoma, but actually, for example, OVAC [Oklahoma Visual Arts 
Coalition] is so supportive. It's been instrumental for funding and support 
and sponsorship and opportunities for my work in Oklahoma. The arts 
community here, it's wonderful. It's a 
wonderful experience. 
[00:38:21] 
Little Thunder 
That's nice to hear. Yeah, you participated in the American Dream, you 
know, prcject on the Greenwood [Art] Project. I 
loved what you did. Could 
you describe, a 
little bit, your prcject... ? 
Ahmad 
Okay. 
Little Thunder 
...your contribution to it? 
Ahmad 
Okay, so the American Dream project is part of the Greenwood Art Prcject, 
and it's part of the Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial, the 1921 Tulsa Race 
Massacre. When I 
moved here, I 
obviously realized that I'm living and 
working on not just the native land, but also, where the race massacre took 
place. I 
was really curious about the history and started attending a 
lot of 
events and meetings that were being hosted in town around the centennial 
and around, these activities to educate myself about it.... During that 
process what happened was that the Greenwood community welcomed me 
and selected me to participate in the Greenwood Art Prcject, which I 
was 
hesitant to even apply for at first, but their encouragement gave me the 
confidence to engage with their history when, as an immigrant, one can 
often feel or be made to feel that one doesn't belong in these conversations. 
Even if we are making our own histories in our adopted homes, we often 
feel that. Their support led me to also work on this project, led to my work 
evolving in the direction of making connections with common histories of 
white supremacy in South Asian, Pakistani, cultural history and the US 
history and finding a 
place in the conversation through that. 
My work is broadening in all these directions, and social engagement, and 
creation of interactive spaces has become important as a 
direct result of the 
opportunities in Tulsa and, being in this community. The Greenwood Art 
14 
Prcject is built around a 
refugee tent. That is the centerpiece. I 
used the 
images of the tents that were used as temporary housing for the people 
whose homes were destroyed. I 
modeled the tent after that, so it's based on 
those tents. It's going to be covered in marigold flowers, and it'll be placed 
in a 
forest. The inside of the tent is going to be filled with collages made 
from archival photographs of the massacre. When I 
looked through these 
images of the Tulsa Race Massacre in my research, hundreds of images, 
refugee tents stood out as a 
common symbol or sign of destruction and 
displacement. You know, to see the refugee tents on the land and 
homes ... that people were made refugees on their own land and on the site of 
their own homes, and how the home represents the American Dream, and 
especially for immigrants, the idea that everyone has the opportunity to 
achieve that dream and build, a 
life for themselves... 
These people had built this successful life and community that was burnt to 
ground by the white people in state-sponsored violence. Then looking at 
how the state-sponsored violence is still going on, hundred years later in 
Pakistan, where the drone attacks have displaced millions of people. The 
drone attacks actually target civilians as well as children. The people have 
been rendered homeless, and I 
was really familiar with the images. I'd been 
looking at the Tulsa Race Massacre images. It struck me that these images 
that I 
still see, coming out of Pakistan of destruction, even though they are 
natural causes of destruction, as well, like earthquakes and floods, the state-
sponsored violence also plays a 
big part in it. I 
wanted to use the refugee 
tent, but having gone through trauma myself, I 
know how it affects your 
health and even your DNA, how the DNA 
is expressed its intergenerational 
trauma that is passed on. For any sort of healing to take place, the trauma 
that is part of one's body, hidden inside, has to be acknowledged first. You 
could be leading a 
successful life but still going through the stages of 
healing from trauma. The tent's interior represents this embodied nature of 
trauma. 
[00:44:03] 
I 
imagined the interiority of the tent as sort of holding that space where 
there's acknowledging the destruction and trauma, but on the outside, it's 
plain. It sort of goes through this transformation through the course of the 
installation by people participating in it and transforming the space into a 
sculptural memorial with flowers around it and converting the tent immersed 
in this space. Initially, my project was different, but COVID happened and 
the quarantine started. Literally for nearly ten, eleven months I've been 
mostly in quarantine, other than obviously emergency necessary travel and 
some work, but working from home. The forest that is in the Oxley Nature 
Center, I 
started going for walks there with another fellow from the 
fellowship, and that became my refuge. The walks became a 
ritual. Just like 
in Memphis, the forest was a 
space of comfort for me and a 
space of respite 
15 
and regeneration. A 
lot of my projects started evolving from that experience, 
and collaborative works with the other fellow. 
Also, when I 
was looking at how to adapt the Greenwood Project, for an 
outdoor installation that doesn't have to be made inside, I 
decided to, after 
conversations with the lead artists, to actually do the installation in that 
nature preserve that I 
would go to for my walks, and converting the nature 
preserve, the whole space of the nature preserve, into sculptural memorials 
along the trails. I 
was researching firebombs and images of firebombs, and 
what immediately struck me was how the firebombs visually recall the 
marigold flowers, even the color with the reds and oranges both the colors 
and the shapes resemble the marigold flowers. The marigold flowers are 
very rich, iconographically rich across cultures because they're not just in 
South Asia, but they're used in funerals, festivals, as sacred offerings. They 
originated in Mexico and are used in the Day of the Dead celebrations. It's 
called Mary's Gold because historically the word marigold originates from 
their use as offerings in altars in place of gold coins. 
There's a 
history of the flower being used across cultures all over the world, 
in these liminal moments of transition, at death and funerals, but also in 
weddings. In Pakistan and South Asia, it's associated with weddings and 
festivals, at this moment of transition in life. I 
looked at the liminality and 
how it represented all these dualities, but also it was a 
symbol of renewal in 
a 
very beautiful way. I 
think it has all these, like, layers of meanings and the 
history of flowers being used to commemorate acts of warfare, to honor the 
dead. This is first that time that I 
am working with natural materials and 
with fabric, working in nature directly, creating the installations with nature 
as a 
collaborator. 
[00:49:23] 
Little Thunder 
Ahmad 
Little Thunder 
Ahmad 
Little Thunder 
Now, it sounds wonderful, but it is not.... This is conceptual, right? You're 
in the conceptual stages cf doing this right now? 
Well, actually, the tent has been made. 
Okay. 
I've created the collages, designed them from photographs of the massacre. 
The Tulsa Historical Society & Museum, gave me permission to use their 
archived photographs for the project, so that is courtesy of the Tulsa 
Historical Society. 
Right. 
16 
Ahmad 
I 
printed the collages on fabric to line the interior of the tent, and I'm at this 
point trying to work out the process of stitching those panels on the tent. I 
had been researching using fresh flowers. We'll skip through this part. I 
was 
in Pakistan for almost two months because my dad fell critically ill, so I 
had 
to travel to visit family. I 
also had to be working on this project, so while I 
was researching the flowers, there were, like, lots of issues of, you know, 
making such a 
huge installation with real flowers. What if something goes 
wrong and the flowers will dry or wither? ... I 
thought that I'd make fabric 
flowers to use in combination with real flowers. I 
was in Pakistan, so I 
started researching fabrics and making prototypes of flowers. I 
worked with 
an NGO that... acts as a 
facilitator for women in the villages to provide them 
with income and work through their handicrafts. 
I 
made prototypes of flowers, and the women through that NGO, the 
Kaarvan Crafts Foundation, I 
connected with these women in the villages 
who were making the flowers for me based on the prototype. It became a 
collaborative work. Even while I 
was in Pakistan, I 
made thirty thousand 
flowers and had them strung in garlands, and textile design interns from 
Zonia Anwaar's Design House helped with this process. She is a 
family 
friend, and she connected me with textile interns. We all worked on figuring 
out, the fabrics and dyes and, and what will last in different weathers, and 
starching it, and the whole process of putting it together. I 
think I 
have about 
thirty, forty thousand flowers that have been made... so that if anything 
happens, my installation can still go up and stay through the course of the 
year. We are also going to use fresh flowers in combination with that. It's 
not only conceptual at this point. It's very much in the process of being 
made at this time. 
[00:52:57] 
Little Thunder 
Yeah, what a 
great way cf connecting people across the world, you know. 
Ahmad 
Yeah, I 
think when I 
visit my family in Pakistan, if I'm there for one month 
or six weeks, I 
work there, as well. It's really my practice is trans-national, 
not just conceptually but also literally involved in the use of resources and 
making work, and ideas back and forth that travel with me, and all of that. 
Little Thunder 
Yeah, wonderful cross-pollinations going on. When will it go /Ap cf ficially, 
though? When will the installation.... 
Ahmad 
It's going to be installed on, installation finished, (I'll do it over the course 
of months) on May 25. 
Little Thunder 
Okay. 
17 
Ahmad 
It's slated to open on May 31, which is the opening reception for the 
Greenwood Art Prc 
ject. 
[00:53:57] 
Little Thunder 
Ahmad 
Okay. You know, it's hard to talk about East-West views. I 
mean, it's just so 
limiting, that vocabulary that we have to talk about d,.) ferent perceptions (f 
art. I 
wonder fy ou can talk a 
little bit about some c 
f 
those d,.) ferent cultural 
approaches to art that you have in your home, that you grew iAp around, that 
you encountered here, and how they've come together or enriched each 
other or.... 
With my work, there's a 
confluence of cross-pollination, as you said, a 
confluence of influences, aesthetic traditions, crafts, and a 
combination of 
all of that.... I 
know we discussed the view of art from my culture as 
opposed to the newer American view of art, and I 
was thinking about that. 
Historically what we called the cult of the artists, the singular genius, is a 
very Eurocentric idea because historically art was enmeshed in our everyday 
lives, not just in the art forms that were created and that were made at home. 
Quilts were made at home by the men, and many other art forms, as well. I 
think in my family experience, and also in the broader cultural experience, 
aesthetics is a 
way of life, really enmeshed in everyday life. I 
thought of 
this, and it's really interesting that even in everyday life, when we talk about 
it, it's not just making art forms but how we are inhabiting spaces and 
moving through spaces. The example that comes to my mind is, like, when 
(this is very recent) I 
was visiting my aunt and peeling an apple. She would 
say that, "You're messing it up. It has to be done elegantly and create this 
pattern." Even in the act of peeling an apple, you are creating a 
pattern and 
shapes in the way you do it. 
My daughter was visiting, and the other day I 
was telling her, "You are 
loading the dishwasher this messy way. How do you come from this 
family?" (Laughter) We have to do everything elegantly. It's an art form 
how you load the dishwasher and create all these patterns with dishes that 
line up in a 
certain order. It becomes part of our everyday conversation. Like 
my son would say, "I 
made the bed your way." (Laughter) His way is a 
different way that is not accepted. He goes back and visits, like, his 
grandmother or even my aunt. It's their way that it has to be done because 
everything is.... I 
think "elegantly" is a 
word that is used a 
lot, but also 
literally, aesthetically, crafting patterns through all the acts that you do. That 
is really interesting, that the concept is not art as a 
commodity or an object, 
but it's the art of daily living, as well as the crafts that are practiced as part 
of daily life. My grandmother used to make applique quilts and design them 
for us at our home. You would not think of that as an art form, but it's a 
very 
beautiful art form with a 
lot of skill that goes into it. We all learn to do 
embroidery and many other activities and skills that we learn along the way. 
18 
[00:58:24] 
With contemporary artists nowadays—it's a 
global tradition that art is 
commodified, and it's the Euro-American view that the art world has 
embraced on a 
global scale. I 
think culturally and historically, the emphasis 
was not on individual artists but more on communal work, and art was 
created more collaboratively. On the other hand, when I 
go back to Pakistan, 
a 
lot of aesthetic traditions are enmeshed in my work and combined with 
other aesthetic traditions into this unique hybrid. For example, on one of my 
trips back when I 
was in graduate school, I 
traveled to Multan to photograph 
and visit Sufi shrines. That area in Pakistan has the biggest concentration of 
shrines of Sufi saints. The architecture is really beautiful. It's very ornate tile 
work... dim lighting, low ceilings, and this very decorative, ornate, spiritual 
environment that is created. What happened was, interestingly, I 
wasn't 
modeling my work after that or using it as an inspiration that, "I'm going to 
come and do this," but the work I 
created immediately after that was the 
Groundless installation. 
The floor, the ceilings, all of the walls were covered with this very 
decorative, colorful artwork, this kaleidoscopic sunset, modeled after the 
sunsets on the Mississippi River but layered with patterns and carvings 
hanging from the ceiling and all over the walls. Several people commented 
on that, several people from cultures here. One of the artists gave the 
example of the church, and said that the installation had the feel of this 
ornate architecture from his culture and has an element of transcendence. He 
said he will bring his church community to visit it because this captures the 
transcendence that is the foundation of the spiritual faith in all religions. 
Those influences work their way into the work in a 
very organic way, so it 
becomes like, wow, this installation I 
made right after coming from Pakistan 
has an effect of the spiritual interior of the shrine. 
The ceiling is low; the lighting is dim. You just enter it, and you're 
immersed in the work, standing inside the artwork itself. It surrounds you 
from all sides. As you walk through it, you get these multiple shifting 
perspectives, but then you see the work as a 
whole and how these are all part 
of this bigger whole, and the whole view of the interconnectedness of 
creation. We are all part of one big whole. These aesthetic influences also 
sort of become a 
part of my work. When I 
looked at the firebomb images, 
marigold flowers are used in Sufi shrines as offerings and also in weddings, 
and it's just like such a 
popular flower there in South Asia that that 
immediately came to my mind. I 
wasn't researching for flowers that would 
represent that theme of renewal and transformation, I 
guess. These are some 
examples of how my work is a 
cross-pollination of influences. 
[01:02:53] 
19 
Little Thunder 
Ahmad 
[01:06:44] 
Well, part c 
f 
your job at the Tulsa Artist Fellowship, too, in addition to 
creating your work, has been to help educate people. I 
wonder fy ou could 
talk a 
little bit about some cf the expectations and/or stereotypes people 
have about immigrant artists, or immigrants in general, and how you 
address them. 
Coming to the Tulsa Artist Fellowship definitely gave me the opportunity 
and also the push to engage in these narratives. I 
spearheaded the immigrant 
narratives program. The first one was a 
discussion panel of immigrant 
artists, and the idea was to dispel the stereotypes of immigrants and 
immigrant artists and make our voices accessible to the community 
directly—for them to hear from us, and be able to talk to us and create a 
bridge between cultures, especially at this time. I 
think there are several 
ways in which I 
would like to interrupt the narrative about immigrants. 
While we are not a 
homogenous group and we have diverse experiences, I 
think one stereotype seems to be that our works will address the "immigrant 
experience." While that is a 
defining experience in my life and all of our 
lives as immigrants, (I'm brown; I 
have an accent) and that identity is 
inescapable, it's not my dominant identity. For example, my identity as a 
mother is a 
role that took precedence in my life and has been my defining 
force in my life. Like how Whitman says, "We all contain multitudes," and 
how Jerry Saltz says, "Art contains multitudes." 
We all have multiple identities, and our artwork can address any part of it. 
The expectation that it will be about the immigrant experience is one thing 
that a 
lot of immigrant artists commented about. Other expectations are that 
immigrant artists will somehow shine the light on oppressions in their own 
countries, and become the spokespersons for injustices, as liberated 
individuals in a 
free society are, conversely. That role shines the light on the 
artists while justifying the savior role in some way, or that we need the free 
society to help liberate oppressed cultures. Spivak's essay title, "Can the 
Subaltern Speak?" comes to my mind when I 
think about it. I 
think the 
immigrant artists can obviously really have many interests and many 
interests that feed our work outside of these identity politics. The cosmos 
inspires me. The structure of the universe inspires me. The concept of the 
possibility of harnessing the power of the universe to manifest one's destiny 
in contemporary spirituality inspires me. Most of all, the beauty and wonder 
of creation inspires me. 
While all these identities are an integral part of my life—being a 
mother, a 
single mother, immigrant, Pakistani American femaleI have a 
core 
identity that transcends these, where I 
exist in a 
space independent of these 
defining politics of society, and where I 
am free and a 
part of the rhythm of 
creation. I 
find that most in nature, so it's a 
place where I 
belong the most in 
a 
way in the non-human world because it's outside of all these labels and 
20 
you are free in a 
different way. In debunking the stereotypes of immigrant 
artists, there are several ways of doing it. The programming series was one 
opportunity to dispel some of these stereotypes and for community members 
to talk to us directly or hear our voices. Another avenue that opened for me 
was when I 
moved here, and Philbrook was having [Wondrous Worlds: Art 
& 
Islam through Time & Place], the exhibition of objects from the Islamic 
world. 
They invited me to share object stories, which was a 
very interesting idea. 
They asked me if I 
can write about the objects in the exhibition from my 
point of view as an artist but also from a 
cultural perspective, because a 
lot 
of these art objects are a 
part of our everyday use, like silverware and wood 
carvings. There were a 
lot of objects I 
saw in the show that we use in our 
homes. I 
talked about those stories, and they invited me to give talks to the 
audiences to talk about different parts of the exhibition and how I 
connected 
with it. In terms of talking about the Islamic culture and the art of the 
Islamic culture, as well as about the immigrant culture, the fellowship 
provided me with these opportunities and avenues to expand those 
conversations. That is another beautiful thing the Tulsa Artist Fellowship 
focuses on. 
[01:09:34] 
Little Thunder 
Ahmad 
Well, I 
think maybe we'll end iAp with one final question here. Yeah, I 
love 
just the beauty and though. fulness c 
f 
your art. You speak and write very 
eloquently about it, in addition to making this eloquent work. You've talked 
a 
little bit in other interviews about Islamic art, the roots c 
f 
Islamic art, and 
how it's interconnected with natural patterns in the natural world. I 
wonder 
f 
you could 
just.... The geometric designs, in fact, come from a 
specs fic 
understanding and place. 
Yes, so that is true because my work explores universal patterns that recurs 
in nature, the human body, the cosmos, as well as juxtaposed with the 
Islamic geometric patterns. That is both for thematic and philosophical 
reasons, the foundational framework for my work, because I'm looking at 
the underlying unity of creation or the cosmic interconnectedness through an 
investigation of pattern. For example, in Fractured Cosmos and some of the 
other works, I 
have used the neuron networks from the human brain, which 
are sort of almost.... Identical wouldn't be the appropriate word, but appear 
identical to the cosmic web networks. The scientists have put images of 
both, side by side, to show how indistinguishable they may appear and how 
the structure, the fundamental structure of the universe, the cosmic web, the 
structure of galaxies, and how they are arranged is so similar to the structure 
of the networks in the human brain. I 
also look to science to show how 
modern scientific technologies make the invisible world, the microscopic 
world, visible. How wondrous it is, that those patterns from that world recur 
21 
in the natural world and then in the cosmos and in the 3-D maps of the 
universe. It's just marvelous. The 3-D map of the universe was the first.... 
The map was put together last year after twenty years of research of 
scanning the sky by the Sloan Digital Sky [ Survey]. 
Where the Islamic patterns come in is that the underlying principles of 
construction are the same as these patterns that, recur throughout the 
creation. But also thematically, all the Islamic patterns are made from a 
circle, which is the perfect symbol of unity and divine creation. It's 
interesting that the map of the universe that was put together is also in 
concentric circles with Earth as the center. The circle is a 
symbol. The 
Islamic patterns are created by multiple divisions of these circles into 
polygons that are then infinitely repeated, and all the patterns are created 
hundreds of patterns are created this way. They symbolize the infinity 
through the continuous repetition, harmony, unity, the divine. Basically, 
historically also, they were used in architecture as screens that represented 
dissolution of the materials, which represents the spiritual within the 
material. The symbolism of the patterns is the same as the wonders of 
creation, which I'm looking at through an investigation of patterns using my 
own observations in the natural world but also in my drawings, but also 
scientific research and patterns made visible by those research technologies. 
I 
think the Islamic patterns aesthetically, obviously, are a 
big part of my 
culture... architecture where I 
grew up. They're used in screens, as well. 
Also, it's the thematic principles that connect with my work. 
[01:14:35] 
Little Thunder 
Great. Well, is there anything you'd like to add, Sarah, that we didn't talk 
about that's important? 
Ahmad 
I 
think my most recent project, Cosmic Veils, that was made here last year in 
Tulsa for the University of Tulsa. That unifies a 
number of these recurring 
themes in my work—destruction and resurrection, or creating something 
beautiful out of fragmented wreckage, or broken pieces of destruction, also 
the notions of veiling which have recurred in my work, such as in the Bol 
series of the women in the woods. The concept of veiling I'm looking at is 
in terms of an unveiling of identity and finding one's voice because I 
found 
that identity through the process of making art at a 
transitional stage in my 
life. When I 
was going through the dissolution of one phase of life or 
identity and at the threshold of transformation into whatever else would 
appear, it was through art that I 
found it. So it's the unveiling of identity in 
that sense, and also creating an immersive site-specific installation where 
the patterns I 
used are in layers as the way they grow in nature or natural 
phenomena. Cosmic Veils is a 
culmination of work of research and ideas 
that came about in this fellowship. So it's about not just the reflection of 
22 
veils, in the way that they are semi-transparent, but ultimately how the veil 
can conceal, how it became a 
metaphor for an unveiling of identities. The 
show is also inspired by the Veil Nebula. The Veil Nebula is the largest 
nebula in the cosmos. It was created by the massive destruction or explosion 
of a 
star. 
[01:17:13] 
It looks like these luminous waves floating in space, these meandering 
filaments in these magenta and pinks and blues. I 
was coincidentally making 
work with women in these same colors, covered in lace fabrics many years 
ago before I 
discovered the nebula, which also looks like these lacy fabrics. 
I 
think in some place, it's also called the Lacy Nebula or Lace Nebula. I 
think all those themes and ideas came together in that installation. It also 
expanded my work in this direction of using light as the primary medium in 
my work. The work transforms through the course of the day. At night, you 
can use light to create your own patterns with light, which look like 
Northern Lights and nebulae and patterns of light. The viewer's body 
becomes the living support for those shifting patterns of light, and becomes 
immersed in it. This method of community engagement to create beautiful 
spaces to experience moments of beauty and wonder and regeneration 
through all the upheavals of life, and creating these aesthetic sanctuaries, to 
have that experience, has been important in my work. Being able to make 
these large-scale installations in Tulsa allowed me to take my t 
work to the 
next level. I 
also think about how during the pandemic and all the social 
upheaval, that the Veil Nebula became a 
much-needed metaphor for renewal 
because this beautiful structure was created by the destruction of the star. 
Little Thunder 
That's really well put. Well, thank you so much for your time today, Sarah, 
and I'm really looking forward to seeing more c 
f 
your work. 
Ahmad 
Thank you so much for taking the time to, you know, interview me. I'm 
really excited about this project, many more of these and more work on, you 
know, immigrant artists. I'm so glad that you're doing this. 
Little Thunder 
Great.
