Abstract: Barbara James Norman is a 4th-generation blueberry farmer in Covert, Michigan. 
Covert, Michigan is a small village in rural Covert township in southwestern Michigan. Covert 
has an unusual history of racial equality dating back to its founding around the Civil War. 
African Americans have owned land, farmed and been elected to high political office in the 
community since the 1860s (before it was actually legal for them to vote in the state of 
Michigan). Ms. Norman grew up in a completely racially integrated public school system. In 
2003 the USDA gave her the National Small Farmer of the Year award. She has been a leader in 
the USDA small farmers association, as well as organizing with schools in Detroit and Chicago 
to bring large groups of inner-city children to her farm.
