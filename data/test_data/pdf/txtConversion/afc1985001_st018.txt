COTTON EYED JOE 5142 A1
King Family Visalia, 1941
Where did you come from Where did you go Where did you come from, Cotton Eyed Joe?
I come from the city I come for to show Come from a place Called Cotton Eyed Joe.
Cotton Eyed Joe had a new suit of clothes Nobody knows where he got them clothes.
Went to the weddin' Went to the show Stuffed my gut Full of sweet cake dough.
