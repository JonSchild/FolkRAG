JOSEPH'S PRAYER
 
If I were to die this night
 
Lord,  take me into Thy transcendental light,  I pray
 
Take me take me bones, blood and skin.
 
Show me my transgressions
 
And set me free once again.
 
But before You do--before I breathe my last--
a few kind requests I
'd like to ask.
 
Be there any man, woman or child
 
whom I have wronged or slighted
 
bring them to me that I might amend
 
my soul thus blighted.
 
If there was a moment I took for granted
 
any particle of Your Earth
 
my distraction with daily affairs supplanted,
 
bring this faulty moment back to me
 
that I might embrace and cherish it
 
reverently on bended knee.
 
Was there a sunset, was there a dawn
 
an unnoticed zephranthus open to bloom
 
unfelt dewdrops across the lawn
 
a shaft of sunlight or a droplet of rain?
 
Were there moments I slighted your mighty creation?
 
Bring them, 0 bring them now that I might contemplate
 
the intricacy of the nature's lace You selflessly work.
 
Let me bless each knot You have tied on Earth,
 
Paradise Land You sacrificed to us
 
for our birth and rebirth.
 
Another thing, Lord, this the most sublime
 
bring back my anger, hatred, admonishment, lust, and greed;
 
return them now that I might all transmute and transcede
 
every unholy thought, action, and deed.
 
Hold them in Your blinding, purifying light
 
that I might see my frailties to fellow man.
 
Transform them, 0 Lord, and let me leave this earth
 
truly a cleansed man.
 
Joseph's Prayer

With all this transmutation done
 
Let your praises be always on my tongue.
 
Let me go, let me go, God bless me
 
when I must leave on that journey
 
man in body can never perceive.
 
In the rays of Thy ever holy light
 
take me, take me--for all spirit
 
will have been consumed
 
and my search for perfection
 
once again resumed.
 
If You do, Lord, in Your domain
 
decide that I must endure the fires of pain
 
though I may thrash and curse and cry
 
I only ask this pain You sanctify
 
and place upon it, with Your bounteous feeling
 
Some great Mystery--a kind of grace and meaning.
 
And when comes the moment to climb the invisible stair
 
to reach Thy chambers of light
 
If Thou findest this advisable in Thy sight
 
meet me Jesus, make me an angel of the air
 
and if Thy wings You place should fail me, Lord
 
hitch on another pair!
 
And now that my humble prayer is done
 
whatever work I still must do, shall be begun.
 
Take these words and rend them asunder
 
Disperse them throughout the Universe
 
emboldened with the rocking
 
of Thy knee-knocking thunder.
 
Scatter them to the East
 
Scatter them to the West
 
Hold them, Lord, in the inscrutable crimson folds
 
of Thy eternally magnanimous breast.
