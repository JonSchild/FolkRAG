Joyce Vegar interview, 2015-01-21 : interview conducted by Nathan J. Moore
and Donald Eugene Stacy
INTERVIEW LOG
00:07:05-00:07:23: Name is Joyce Vegar, but goes by Joy.  Lives in Lakeside, Oregon.  Has 
worked as a home care worker for 13 years.
00:07:30-00:08:12: Other jobs—fry cook, certified professional nanny for 15 years, childcare 
provider.  Recruited to home care work by childcare co-worker.     
00:08:19-00:09:24: Has worked mainly with seniors, but also with clients in the mental health 
system.  Has done hospice work and worked with clients with Parkinson's, diabetes, and 
Alzheimer's.  Has lived-in with clients.
00:09:30-00:10:22: Has worked exclusively on a one-on-one basis with clients.  Sometimes part 
of a caregiving team, but only one home care worker is there at the same time.  When you 
“live-in,” you work for a certain number of days, and then another worker takes over.  Also 
worked in situations that are not quite “live-in,” but involves shift work.  Always kept a notebook
and arrived early to speak with other home care workers.
00:10:32-00:11:11: Has been on duty twice when clients passed away.  Worked with one client 
for 20 months.  She got to pass away in her bed with Joy, her dog, and her cat in the room, which
was what she wanted.  
00:11:31-00:13:08: Previous jobs have involved caregiving.  Sees herself as a people person.  It's
important to know that her job makes a difference.  People get to stay in their own homes, go 
places, do things.  One client had cancer and could no longer talk.  Joy would get her out of 
apartment and take her for drives.  Sometimes did this on her own time without pay.
00:13:20-00:14:37: Can anyone do this work?  Yes, but not everyone can do it well.  You have to 
have compassion and like people.  You should not be a home care worker if you remain 
uninvolved and disconnected with clients.  Don't have to be bosom buddies with clients, but you 
have to care for them.  You have to be willing to roll up your sleeves and get dirty.

00:14:56-00:16:33: How do you learn the job?  There are training programs now, but not when 
she entered the field.  There used to be just a basic orientation.  Got lucky with first client — a 
stroke victim whose wife was a former CNA (certified nursing assistant).  Learned a lot of skills 
from her.  Now there are good paid trainings on a variety of subjects that workers can access 
through the Oregon Home Care Commission.  Important to keep learning.   
00:16:41-00:17:49: Does get close to clients, some more than others.  Has become close to some 
of the families.  Also has been a care giver for members of the same family.  Works closely with 
family members when caring clients with Alzheimer's and dementia.   
00:18:03-00:19:55: Emotional relationships with clients can be stressful, especially when 
someone passes away.  Being a Christian helps.  Often prays at work when things are going 
wrong.  People with dementia often “lose their filters” and yell at caregivers.  Going for a walk 
in nature helps.  
00:19:58-00:20:37: On two separate occasions, the person who was supposed to relieve her did 
not arrive.  Ended up working thirteen straight days with no help.  Dealt with it by going outside 
for small periods of time.
00:20:47-00:23:00: Has been a first responder for people in emergency situations, sometimes in 
the middle of the night.  There are times you work on your days off because there is no one else 
available.  Flexibility is important, but does like to have a general idea of what the client needs.  
Usually, there's a task list to follow, but it's not always possible to stick to it.
00:23:03-00:25:30: Has a twenty-two-year-old daughter, who was ten when Joy started home 
care work.  When a client broke her hip and locked herself in her house, Joy's daughter climbed 
through the window and opened the door.  She was a hero.  
00:26:23-00:28:35: Is there a typical day in home care work?  Yes and no.  Depends on the task 
list.  Some jobs involve only cleaning, others involve meal prep, activities, etc.  Almost always 
has more than one client at a time.  Currently has six clients and carries out a variety of tasks—
housekeeping, cleaning, and even takes one client out to dinner.   
00:28:41-00:29:40: Likes the variety and being around different people.  Works with three 
different clients on Tuesdays.  Very busy.
00:29:48-00:30:32: What do you talk about with clients?  Anything and everything.  Doesn't talk 
about her faith unless client is a Christian and brings it up.  Talks about families, dogs, 
interesting things that have happened, news items.  You talk like you would talk to a friend.  
2
00:31:34-37:02: Any specific stories that illustrate what being a caregiver is like?  Yes.  Lived 
part of the week with a client and shared duties with another less experienced home care 
provider.  Client experienced a medical emergency and the other caregiver called the fire 
department.  Joy arrived, got into bed behind client, put her hands on his shoulders, and told him 
to breathe.  Client calmed down and did not have to be transported.  Did what had to be done in 
that situation.  Another client was developing a pressure sore from sitting in a recliner.  Went to 
her house at two in the morning every morning and switched the pillow.  Learned a lesson after 
messing up her own sleep schedule — just because you can do something doesn't mean you 
should.  
00:37:13-00:39:15: Experience helps home care workers know what to look for on the job.  
Caregivers are always on the look out for things like pressure sores. 
00:39:18-00:41:18: Humor is very important.  Part of Joy's philosophy — you can laugh or you 
can cry and laughing is more fun.  Sometimes things are genuinely funny.  Tells story of cat 
jumping on her while helping client in the bathroom.  Some clients like to laugh more than 
others.
00:41:24-00:44:23: Currently serves as home care council director for Coos and Curry Counties. 
Attends meetings at labor hall in Coos County and travels to Gold Beach for Curry County 
meetings.  Very active in the union.  Also serves on three committees.  Getting together with 
other union members is really helpful.  There aren't other people at the work site, so it's nice to 
talk about your day, experiences, get advice.  Helps you realize that you are not the only one who
has experienced things like clients refusing to take medicine or take a bath.  It's nice to be in a 
room where everyone thinks that your job has value. 
00:44:38:-00:45:53: Caregiver talk—outsiders might not understand acronyms like PSW 
(personal support workers).  Caregivers talk about things that non-caregivers don't normally 
discuss — anatomy, giving baths, catheter care, etc.     
00:46:47-00:48:50: Learns best through hands-on experience.  Tells clients that they will have 
repeat things in the beginning.  Also learns by making notes to self.  Lots to remember with six 
clients.  Not currently cooking for any clients.
00:48:58-00:50:18: Has the union made a difference in your work?  Yes.  When first started, 
there was no workers' compensation.  Was always worried about tripping or hurting self.  Now 
has paid time-off and health insurance.  Has high blood pressure and allergies and medications 
are covered.  Nice to be able to see the doctor, especially when dealing with women's and 
age-related health issues.

00:50:20-00:51:20: Has traveled to the Oregon State Capitol (in Salem, Oregon) for lobby days.  
Doesn't just advocate for self; advocates for clients too.  Important to share stories with 
lawmakers.  Remembers a client being asked, “What does your home care worker mean to you?”
He responded, “It means I get to keep my feet.”  He was insulin-dependent and couldn't put on 
support hose.  Home care workers put it on for him.  “I defy anyone to hear a story like that and 
not think that the program needs to be funded.”
00:51:21-00:52:15: The SEIU [Service Employees International Union] care provider umbrella 
includes home care workers, personal support workers, childcare workers, nursing home 
workers, and workers in adult foster homes.  If everyone who receives home care support goes to
nursing homes, what will we do with the people who need to be there?  We don't have the money
and bed space for everyone.  It costs taxpayers a lot less to have Joy go in for a few hours a day 
than it does to put people in 24- our facilities. 
00:52:19-00:52:49: Has not testified in a legislative session, but has talked to individual 
legislators.  Will be talking with local legislators at an upcoming town hall meeting.  
00:52:53-00:54:14: Some home care workers take clients to lobby days, but Joy's clients don't 
travel well.  Home care workers wear purple union colors on trips.  Currently, has a union t-shirt,
vest, and jacket.  Was in Mexico several years ago and was amused that her cosmetic kit, day-trip
bag, and purse all had SEIU logos on them.
00:54:19-00:54:32: At the lobby days, if there is a big gathering, someone will start chanting, 
SEIU!, SEIU! (with clapping on the beats).  Everyone joins in. 
00:54:45-00:55:38: All wear purple so legislators will see them.  If one person says that 
something needs to change, politicians will think about it.  If a sea of purple shows up and says, 
“We really think you should fund this program,” it's hard to ignore it. 
00:56:12-00:56:57: Discussion of various SEIU colors.  Don Stacy (videographer) notes that his 
SEIU union local wears red.  Joy: it's important that each sector of the union has an individual 
identity as well as a collective identity. Discussion between Nathan and Joy about what the term 
“home care worker” means and how it is often applied to multiple jobs.      
 
00:57:05-00:59:40: How does the community view home care work?  Some people are aware of 
what home care workers do, but a lot are not.  One third of Curry County's population is 65 or 
older.  One-quarter to one-fifth of Coos County's population is 65 or older.  A lot of people need 
help or will need it in the future.  They are part of the community and should be taken care of.  
It's part of the covenant we make with workers in the U.S.  If you work hard all your life, you 
should be able to retire and be cared for.  If we don't do this, we're letting people down.  There 
are other cultures that revere their elderly and we can learn from them.

00:59:49-01:00:09: Works with male and female clients.  It depends mostly on personality.  
01:00:14:-01:00:35: Hobbies — walking, reading, watching movies and television, going for 
drives, talking to people.  Active in the Hauser Community Church.  
01:01:48:-01:02:38: Something surprising about home care work?  The organizational part.  
Helping people with memory issues involves booking appointments, taking them to physical 
therapy, filling the medicine box.  People don't know that home care workers “make the whole 
place run.”
01:02:56-01:04:17: Sometimes has to make necessary changes in a client's life.  Tells story of 
client who threatened another caregiver with a kitchen knife.  Joy made the decision to move 
knives to a safer place.  Calls this “living-proofing the environment.”    
01:01:32-01:05:32: Plans on doing this work as long as physically able.  May transition to more 
specialized work that doesn't involve as much physical exertion.   
01:05:40-01:08:58: Discusses Harris v. Quinn, a court case in Illinois.  Any home care worker 
knows about it.  The Supreme Court coined a brand new phrase: fully-fledged state worker.  The 
Court said home care workers are not fully-fledged and entitled to certain benefits.  Impacted 
SEIU in Oregon.  Union stopped collecting fair share dues from non-members that still benefited
from collective bargaining.  Likens it to hooking up to the neighbor's cable.  Everyone should 
help pay.  Very offended by the idea that home care workers are not fully-fledged state workers.  
Considers it a civil rights issue.  It will be an ongoing fight and SEIU may not win.  Public 
unions are the last strongholds of unionism in the U.S.  Unions don't mean what they used to 
mean.  Union didn't used to be a dirty word.  Going to a union meeting wasn't something that you
had to do on the sly.  Middle class is vanishing so that people at the top can make more money.  
01:09:00-01:09:52: Father was a union carpenter, owns his home.  Joy lives in a mobile home 
that's falling apart.  Not sure how it can be replaced.  We need to take care of the care providers.
01:10:09-01:13:10: Frustrated about not being a fully-fledged state worker.  Receives pay 
voucher from a state office, paycheck says “State of Oregon” on it.  Also does the union 
orientation for Coos and Curry Counties in state buildings.  Why suddenly a second-class 
citizen?  Works on SEIU's civil and human rights committee.  An African-American committee 
member reminded Joy that social security originally excluded domestic and agricultural workers.
Why?  Because they were non-whites.  Do we really want to go back to differentiating between 
the value of workers on the basis of what they do or the color of their skin?  Home care workers 
are one of the most diverse work populations because people who need care come in all shapes, 
colors, and sizes.

01:14:40-01:16:42: Question from Don Stacy: How do you feel about the recent push for 
$15/hour in industries like fast food?  How do you feel about home care administrators who say 
that they can't pay workers that amount?  Joy supports anyone who can get $15/hour because a 
rising tide floats all boats.  The heads of corporations need to re-examine what the phrase “can 
afford” means.  Discusses the difference between heads of corporations affording luxury 
vacations and workers making choices between food and medication.  Talks about being a single 
mother and trying to make ends meet. 
01:16:52-01:17:02: Notes that many home care workers keep working past retirement age.  
Knows home care workers in their seventies or older because they can't afford to retire.
01:18:11-01:21:30: Example of the importance of home care work.  Imagine being in a Wal-Mart
or walking down the street.  Think about everyone you see who is over 65 and imagine all of 
them not being there anymore.  They are our bridges to the past.  We need to respect that.  
Discusses her father and all of the buildings that he helped build.  He deserves to be taken care of
in his old age.  Also talks about mother's struggles with dementia and not being able to have a 
home care worker.  
01:22:47-01:24:26: Talks about how home care workers can contribute to decision making on 
health care policies and senior programs.  Home care workers have experience and common 
sense.  Gives example based on former client's experiences.  
01:26:39-01:29:00: Home care workers at risk for occupational injuries and sexual harassment.  
Having status and stature provides protection.  There is a need for a group setting in which home 
care workers can share their experiences and receive support.  
01:30:30: End of interview.
