I was interested in interviewing Rina Monarca because she is a Sicilian hairdresser with a 
predominately black clientele. In the salon world this is a rare.  Most black women will only 
go to black hairstylists because they are more familiar with their hair texture. Since southern 
Italians tend to have curlier hair, I imagined that Monarca had more experience and less fear 
of handling black hair. 
 
We arrived at Monarca’s salon at noon. It is located on a large, busy, suburban highway in an 
unassuming building. However once we walked in it was quite impressive. It was a large 
salon, about 1500 square feet with vaulted natural wood ceilings. Monarca is small and blonde 
with a generous spirit and welcoming personality. She was very easy to talk to and extremely 
professional.  
 
Her client, Jessica Glover, an African American woman, was getting her hair blown straight. I 
photographed Monarca washing Glover’s hair and blowing it dry. Her hair is not chemically 
straightened so she had to blow it out from its natural state. I have never seen this done 
before. Most black women who get blowouts have their hair straightened beforehand. It was 
quite impressive and labor intensive. The blow out took about forty minutes and a great deal 
of physical effort. It was a significant transformation from thick, coarse, kinky hair to smooth 
and straight.  
 
After Monarca finished styling Glover’s hair, we sat in the back room and I interviewed her 
for over an hour. The salon was closed that day so it was completely quiet. After we finished, 
Monarca offered to wash my hair and blow it dry, which I graciously accepted. She did a 
beautiful job and I tried to offer her money, but she wouldn’t take it. We left about 4:30pm.
