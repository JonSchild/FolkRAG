Interviewee English:   
I remember when I first learned how to weave, there was 
hardly any thread. People were weaving mostly with local 
fibers, such as hibiscus fibers and banana fibers. The weaving 
tools were all made of local wood. I, myself, first learned from 
my mom. I also learned by watching and observing other 
ladies when they wove. 
  
Then I practiced making my warp (chow) with sticks that were 
planted into the ground as my warping board. By the time I 
started using the real warping board, I had an idea of how and 
where to move my hands first. I started learning how to weave 
with the local fibers, but now I have woven more lavalava using 
commercial threads because it’s faster and there are more 
variations of colors.  When weaving with local fibers, the fibers 
break easily because they are more fragile compared to the 
thread, which rarely breaks. And sometimes, if you are lucky, 
the local fibers are strong enough and won’t break like other 
times. Weaving with local fiber is faster because it is lighter 
than thread.  
  
Thread just came later, which makes weaving easier and 
faster because it eliminates the preparations of fibers, and you 
have to have sufficient amounts to make one lavalava. Fr. 
Walter was the first person that brought thread to our 
islands. Having these threads, people made plenty of lavalava 
and had more to wear because it’s much easier to make. 
  
When the thread first arrived, we didn't know how much or how 
many to use, that will be enough for one lavalava like the local 
ones. So, we tried out by guessing and experimenting until we 
figured out how much thread is good for one lavalava.   
  
Nowadays, we are using nylon thread for heddle string (yal 
ngung) to weave lavalava. Back in the day, we used the leaves 
of a type of plant which we call “Fach”(pandaus leaves). We 
take off the skin or outer layer of the leaf and scrape off the 
inner portion and the juice from the fibers, dry them, and tie 
them together to have a long string that will be enough to use 
for a heddle string. We used small rocks to spool the heddle 
string onto, and we used it when we made the warp (chow). 
(Making the chow, or the warp, is the first part of weaving, 
where the colors are put together on the warping board.) 
Nowadays, there are a lot of different objects from the new 
modern items that are much better to use for the same 
purpose than a rock.

04:07 Question 2 
2.   In your mind, who is the one person you most associate with weaving in your life and 
why?

Interviewee English: 
At the beginning of my learning process, I associated more 
with my mom because she taught me how to do different kinds 
of warping and weaving. When I could do weaving on my own, 
I associated with my peer groups because there were things 
that they knew and I didn’t know, so I learned from them, and 
there were things that I knew, and they don’t know, so I shared 
with them. Especially during the duration of our menstrual 
cycle (usually 7 days) where we are to stay together (in the 
women’s house), so we collaborated and shared ideas in 
weaving strategies with other ladies that are there, too. We 
also had competitions in tying or connecting the local fibers, so 
by the end of your stay at the women’s house, you would have 
enough to make a warp when your next period cycle comes. 
And if it’s weaving that you are doing, the competition is there 
so you can finish it before your cycle at the women’s house 
comes to an end.  What’s good about our weaving 
collaboration at the women’s house is you get to share the 
colors you have that others don’t have, and they also share 
what they have that you don’t have. We also share ideas of 
4 
 
lavalava design, or tactics that make the warping and weaving 
easier and faster. That’s why I associate more with my group 
at the women’s house. We had good competitions. 
06:11 Question 3 
3.   Why is weaving so important to you?

Interviewee English: 
Weaving lavalava is important because: 
1. It is used as our clothing.   
2. It is given to our daughters after they’ve had their first 
menstrual cycle (they stop wearing grass skirts and wear 
lavalava as a sign of entering into womanhood).   
3. It’s given to people, such as parents, husbands, and 
children) when they travel off island. 
4. It is used if one of our kids or relatives fights with 
somebody or hurts somebody and draws blood. We give 
the lavalava for making peace. 
5. It is used for weddings. Like if your son or brother marries 
someone, the paternal relative is responsible to gather 
some lavalavas for the bride. 
6. When we travel to Yap main island, we give lavalava to our 
“sawei” (people in Yap main island that we treat as our 
relatives) to protect us while in Yap. 
08:21 Question 4 
4.   How has weaving or woven skirts changed over your lifetime, or since the lifetime of 
those who taught you?

Interviewee English: 
Weaving has changed a lot. Back in the day, we only made 
two types of lavalava called “Gulfei” and “Guluch”.  Gulfei is 
made from hibiscus fibers and is worn by women, and Guluch 
is made from banana fibers and is worn by men. Oh, there’s 
also one that is a mix of hibiscus fiber and banana fiber that we 
call “Pathguluch”, and it is worn by women as well. For the 
colors, there are only a few colors which are the natural colors 
of the fiber. The hibiscus layers next to the bark are lighter 
brown and the inner layers are even lighter than the light 
brown. Nowadays, with these threads, there are more colors 
available. The first threads that were introduced to our island 
were limited in colors. So we were only able to make black and 
white, blue and white, black and red, and blue and red. Right 
now, we have all kinds of colors. We can make striped colored 
lavalava with many colors and we make different designs of 
lavalavas. There are lavalavas that we make with one plain 
color so we weave in supplemental weft designs (fich) and 
6 
 
writings that will display a good phrase or maybe their name. It 
is up to each weaver what color and design they like to do 
nowadays. Back then, only “Machi”, a lavalava that is given to 
the chiefs only, is the one that comes in different designs and 
patterns of supplemental weft.  
11:51 Question 5  
5.    If you could talk to your great-granddaughter about weaving, what would you want to tell 
her?

Interviewee English: 
I would like to tell my daughters to learn to weave because 
there are so many things in our culture that we use lavalava 
for.  Weaving holds a very important aspect in our 
culture.  They need to weave to always have lavalava on hand 
in case something happens suddenly, and then they have it 
available.  So, if there is a death (we lay our dead in the 
lavalava and we cover them with it as if it were a sheet), 
fighting (we give lavalava for peacemaking), or relatives 
traveling afar (we give lavalava for farewells), then we have 
them available. It’s bad in our culture that when things happen 
you don’t have lavalava because you don’t know how to 
weave. Now that modernization is kicking in, maybe people will 
start wearing dresses, but I will tell them they need to learn 
because when things happen that we need to address in our 
culture, lavalava (gow) will always hold that important place in 
our culture. And it is irreplaceable.
