0 :--
The prettiest girl in all this town lives just across the way 
I'm going to call on her and see if she will name the clay; 
She is very sweet on both of us, which one she cannot say, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. 
She promised to be mine, and said how happy we would be 
Before I 
went away she said she loved no one but me; 
:ft 
She may be fooling both of us, but now we're going to see 
Which one shall wed Miss Katie Ann O'Connor. 
CHORUS; 
Katie Ann O'Connor she is the prettiest girl I know, 
Katie Ann O'Connor said I 
might be her beau; 
She is sweeter than the flowers that in the garden grow, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. ( Repeat). 
Now all the boys around the town have got her on the brain 
The girls they are so jealous that they're mighty near insane; 
But Katie she don't notice it, she loves me just the same, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. 
So now we are going to leave you, and will come som e 
other time, 
And when we do, we'll let you know when the marriage 
bells does chime; 
To the wedding we'll invite you all, and won't we have a 
time, 
With this pretty girl, Miss Katie Ann O'Connor. 
(Chorus), 
My Pretty Irish Queen, Farewell! 
Words and Music by FIELDS & LESLIE, the only Neat Irish Dancing 
and Singing Artists in America, who never fail to please. 
In a 
distant sunny land that's far away, 
'Tis Erin's lovely isle; 
There lives the fairest maiden in the land, 
And did our hearts beguile; 
Saucy sparkling eyes of sapphire hue, 
Their glances on us fell; 
We could no longer stand their thrall, 
So my pretty Irish Queen, farewell! 
Her ways are so enticing, 
That tongue can never tell; 
One-half the love is fascination, 
So my pretty Irish Queen, farewell. 
Oh, yes, I 
thought I 
won her heart, 
And from me I 
thought she ne'er would part. 
Saucy sparkling eyes of sapphire hue, 
They completed just the spell; 
Our hearts were aching when we sailed, 
My pretty Irish Queen, farewell. 
If you chance to roam across the sea, 
To view that Emerald land; 
And you should chance to meet a 
lovely lass, 
So beautiful and bland; 
Do not listen to her silvery voice, 
It weaves a 
dangerous spell; 
But close your ears to her and say, 
My pretty Irish Queen, farewell. 
her ways are so enticing, 
That tongue can never tell; 
One-half her love is fascination, 
So my pretty Irish Queen, farewell. ( Chorus), 
RESPECT SHOW TO OLD AGE. 
Words and Music by JAMES J. 
LESLIE, and sang by FIELDS & LESLIE 
with immense success in all the Theatres throughout the United 
States. ( New York's Greatest Favorites). 
Behold our smiling faces, 
Overjoyed with happiness; 
Our cup of joy it has been filled 
With sunshine and with bliss; 
Old age is creeping on us now, 
And feeble grow § our gait; 
This is our golden wedding day, 
And the young folks celebrate. 
CHORUS: 
Obedient to your parents be, 
Each word should bring a 
charm; 
Protect now and provide for them, 
And shield them from all harm. (Repeat). 
Now, young folks, take this moral, 
To you each and every one; 
Your parents cannot always last, 
You'll miss them when they're gone; 
They cherished and protected you, 
And nursed you in their arms; 
And brought you up to manhood, 
So shield them from fill harm. 
(Chorus), 
Words and Music by JAMES J. 
FIELDS, and sang by FIELDS & LESLIE, 
only. The Great Irish Comedian Team. 
Good evening, kind friends, we have just stepped in, 
If you'll listen, we'll tell who we are; 
We are a 
pleasant old couple as you can see, 
And we are known both near and far; 
We are old and gray, and we are on our way, 
Through the pathway of life; 
And as we pass by, the young folks they cry, 
There's old Mr. Logan and wife. 
CHORUS: 
He.—For I'm old Mr. Logan, 
She.—I'm Mrs. Logan, 
Both.—Old Mr. Logan and wife; 
She's Mrs. Logan, I'm Mr. Logan, 
Old Mr. Logan and wife. (Repeat). 
We've settled down for life you see, 
In our little old country home; 
Two boys and a 
girl was our happy lot, 
So you see we are not left alone; 
our life's a 
dream, with joy supreme, 
Devoid of care and strife; 
And as we pass by, the young folks all say, 
There's old Mr. Logan and 
(Chorus) 
As sang with great success by MISS JENNIE HUGHES. 
I 
know a 
jolly old bachelor, 
Who lives next door to me, 
Though he is thought a 
bit of a 
bore, 
In jolly good company; 
For he is such an inquisitive man, 
That if you e'er should meet, 
He'll button- hole you if he can, 
And give you the following treat. 
CHORUS.—Does your mother take in washing? 
Has she sold her mangle 
What's become of the old piano, 
Your sister used to strangle? 
Has your father plenty of work ? 
Does be still get boozed too 
Tell me all the particulars, 
And stop as long as you used to. 
Now this old man has lots of wealth, 
So he's not without a 
Choice friends who'll call to drink his health, 
And borrow a 
pound or two; 
But the old man cross-examines them so, 
That they're glad to get away, 
As rich as they came, and as out they go, 
With a 
grin on his face he will say. 
CHORUS.—Does your mother, &e. 
This bachelor's blessed with a 
lovely niece, 
His heiress, so they say, 
So I 
thought I'd try to be in the piece, 
And told my love one day : 
"Oh! speak to my Uncle, sir," she said, 
" 
With his consent we'll wed," 
So I 
asked him if she could be my bride, 
When he drew me aside, and said. 
CHORUS.—Does your mother, &c. 
The ladies give him their sweetest smiles, 
And flatter and coax him so, 
But he can see through their artful wiles, 
Though his knowledge he does not show, 
They make him presents of gloves and ties, 
And handkerchiefs white as snow, 
Which be will wave before their eyes, 
As he asks with a 
chuckle and crow. 
CHORUS — poeS your mother, &e. 
Sons of Erin's Isle. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisaxx, 11379. 
We've heard marshal songs and songs of the sea; 
Love songs and comic songs, but they don't suit me. 
We love to sing of Ireland—sweet land of our birth— 
I'm Paddy, her son, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh Erin, my country it grieves us to see 
Our enemies prosper, and yet we are not free. 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the sons of Erin's Isle! 
Hurrah for the daughters, who on us do smile 
A 
fig for her foes, where-ever they may be; 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Then arise, sons of Erin, and prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled. 
Be united like brothers, and join hand in hand, 
Then you'll drive the proud Saxon from off of our land. 
Sure the land is the people's, and who dare to dispute 
The word of our maker—for he spoke the truth. 
Then desend from the hill, and arise from the glen, 
And once more the battle of freedom begin. 
Then hurrah, &c. 
SOMETHING TO TICKLE THE GIRLS. 
Written by A.

FRENCH. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique. 
Music by T. B. 
KELLEY 
The pet of the girls ev'ry where, 
Society calls me a 
wit; 
For nothing gets on unless there, 
I 
drop in to please them a 
bit; 
I've stories not few, and jokes that are new, 
As brilliant they tell me as pearls; 
Nonsense now and then is liked by all men, 
Of course it will tickle the girls. 
• 
Cnouns• 
Someth_ng to tickle the girls, 
Laughing and shaking their curls; 
You'll not go amiss, I 
promise you this, 
With something to tickle the girls. 
Some chaps they are terrible bores, 
Some spoony and dull as a 
hoe; 
No kind that a 
gay girl adores, 
She favors no one who is slow; 
Some fellows are shy, and others they try, 
To please when as crabbid as churls; 
I'm not either one, I 
can revel in fun, 
And can always tickle the girls. 
(Chorus). 
Then take my advice ev'ry one, 
And put it at once to the test; 
Go in with the girls and have fun, 
For that is just what suits them best; 
They like a 
gay heart, who does well his part, 
To cheer them as life swiftly whirls; 
You're always their friend, to love and commend, 
With something to tickle the girls. 
(Chorus).

I'm Waltzingham McSweeney, 
A 
man well known to fame, 
I'm a 
shining light at all the clubs, 
I'm a 
man of pluck and game. 
I'm the best known man on Broadway, 
On account of my form and face, 
And the stylish way I 
carry myself, 
With a 
walk of air and grace, 
I'm the one you can't help notice, 
I'm a 
man of splendid parts, 
I've a 
high-born education, 
I'm decomplished in all the arts 
I 
can swim like Captain Boynton, 
I 
can walk a 
Highland fling, 
I 
can pull a 
boat with Hanlon, 
I'm a 
crack shot on the wing. 
WALTZINGHAM MCSWEENEY. — CONTINUED. 
CHORUS. 
Waltzingham McSweeney, 
That's the cognomen I 
bear, 
The ladies admire my pretty shape 
And aristocratic air, 
The swells they all get jealous, 
When the dashing girls at me lear, 
For my graceful glide in the ball-room, 
I'm called the gay cavalier. 
I'm a 
great pedestriau walker, 
My record dates far back, 
I'd be sure to beat O'Leary, 
If they'd let me on the track, 
I'm known at all the races, 
My bets are all the boast, 
I 
can always name the winning horse, 
Before he leaves the post, 
All politicians seem to know me, 
They shake my hand with pride, 
For they know my great influence 
In elections turn the tide. 
All the Congressmen and Senators, 
Admire me everywhere, 
And Waltzingham McSweeney, 
Some say will be your Mayor.

When They're Making Me a 
King, 
As sung by America's Own Vocalist, TONY PASTOR, at his own theaxre,, 
Broadway. 
I 
had a 
dream the other night, I 
dreamt I 
was a 
king, 
And fifty million subjects to my honor they did sing; 
When I 
awoke, I 
soon found out the dream it wasn't true; 
I 
don't think I 
shall be a 
king, I 
really don't; do you? 
CHORUS. 
When the moon is made of green cheese, when pigs begin to 
fly, 
When four-and-twenty blackbirds are all baked in a 
pie; 
When the pie is opened, if the birds begin to sing, 
That will I
P?, about the time they're making me a 
king. 
Were I 
a 
king, the workingman should have his " old time" 
pay, 
And sewing girls should never toil for thirty cents a 
day, 
I'd take a 
trip to Canada, where Ilennett he has gone, 
And make the people happy there, for they are all for-
Lorne. 
When the moon; &c. 
Were I 
a 
king, I'd give each gut a 
rich and wealthy beau. 
On every blooming widow I 
a 
husband would bestow; 
I'd give a 
candy store apiece to little girls and boys, 
And from the Elevated Road, I'd soon extract the noise.. 
When the moon. &c. 
WHEN THEY'RE MAKING ME A KING. 
Continued. 
Were I 
a 
king I'd go around with Talmage every night, 
I'd take a 
peep in every den to see them drink and fight; 
But when I 
feel inclined to go and see the haunts of sin, 
I 
think that Brooklyn would be found a 
good place to begin. 
When the moon, &c. 
Were I 
a 
king, I'd make the parsons practice what they 
preach. 
I'd take away policemen's clubs that have too long a 
reach; 
The beggar. 
d the man of wealth I'd give an equal 
chance, 
And find out how much Murphy gets for preaching temper-
ance. 
When the moon, &c. 
Were I 
a 
king, I'd make the land with milk and honey flow, 
Who was it robbed a 
certain grave? I 
very soon should 
know ; 
On every grand piano leg, I'd draw a 
stocking fair, 
Lest Comstock should pop inland find some misdemeanor 
there. 
The Electric Light. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR, at his own theatre, Broadway, with 
success. 
The time is coming when no one can tell the day from night, 
And that will be when we shall see the new electric light. 
Then gas will have to vanish, as all gassy subjects should, 
Nnd the "Yankee Triumph" it will shine upon the bad and 
good; 
The bold policeman on his beat can never go to sleep, 
While all our ball-room beauties, who now look solace at night, 
Will not seem quite so charming by the new Electric Light. 
CHORUS. 
There's some of us will welcome, 
And some will hate the sight 
Of the latest, greatest wonder. 
That's the new Electric Light. 
The light will show our loving wives if husbands come holm, 
" 
straight." 
And all the " spooney " pairs at night a 
kissing at the gate! 
'Twill show the rich man just the way to help the starving 
poor, 
And the way to keep the prowling wolf from honest labor's 
door! 
'Twill show the road to " good old times," now specie pay-
ment's here, 
And how long Murphy's converts will abstain from gin and 
beer ! 
'Twill show us how our sweethearts keep their " curls" so 
long and bright, 
We'll see what makes their " blushes " by the new Electric 
Light. 
There's some of us, Sm. 
THE ELECTRIC LIGHT. 
Continued. 
This light will show us how .to got the," cash" from " broken 
banks," 
And why them bold directors are allowed to play such pranks. 
'Twill show us why policemen club the helpless and the old, 
When the banks are robbed in broad daylight by burglars 
stout and bold 
'Twill help a 
girl to ferret out what tints her sweetheart's 
nose, 
And why her dashing neighbors wear such fine, expensive 
clothes. 
zhow us if those " cyphers " that -we read of were all 
right, 
We'll find our honest statesmen by the new Electric Light. 
There's some of us, &c. 
This light will show the honest man beneath the ragged coat, 
And why our " Little Johnny" wouldn't let the people vote. 
'Twill guide the Reverand Talmage on , some other vice to 
speak, 
:Ind will show him clearly " some " are " frauds" who hear 
him twice a 
week. 
Twiii show who writes the " Personals," and what they all 
:nay mean, 
!and why the girlz, with " navy busts' when dressed so stout 
are seen ? 
Why some one found a 
baby on his door step one fine night, 
.
,3ool look quiet apparent by the new Electric Light. 
There's some of us, &c. 
The Personals. 
Written by SAUL SERTREW and sung by America's Own Vocalist, Tom, 
As I 
was a 
reading the " Herald " one morning, 
The " Personal Column" I 
happened to see, 
And I 
made up a 
song while I 
was a 
reading, 
Of the things that I 
saw so funny to me. 
There were strange informations and friends and relations, 
For each other asking, both old and the young, 
And chaps with their sweethearts appointments were making, 
How some of them read now I'll sing in my song. 
Oh, Baby, my darling, now meet me at " Bigots," 
And I'll buy for you, precious, a 
camel's hair shawl; 
There's a 
love of a 
diamond that I 
have my eye on, 
And I 
also have tickets for " Lannigan's Ball." 
Oh, beautiful Georgy, oh, where art thou, darling ? 
The store I've been passing for many a 
day, 
Oh, tell me, my darling, have you been arrested, 
Or up on the Island, or gone far away ? 
Will charming young widow, so guileless and pretty, 
The night it was storming, I 
met on the train; 
Who told her sad story on which I 
took pity, 
Please be returning my gold watch and chain. 
Oh, why don't that fellow bring back my umbrella, 
The day it was raining he borrowed from me, 
To see home a 
lady, and carried her baby, 
While his wife was a 
waiting his coming to tea. 
TIM PERSONALS. 
Continued. 
All is forgiven, come home to your mother, 
Your father's a 
waiting for you at the door, 
My son, don't be kicking, now take a 
good licking, 
And say you will never get drunk any more. 
Five hundred babies are wanted as midgets, 
Regardless of color, the hair, or the eyes, 
Cross-eyed or triplets, fat ones or thin ones, 
The one that cries loudest will capture the prize. 
If gent, who is married, and seen in a 
carriage, 
A 
kissing a 
certain young widow so gay; 
If he don't send to Smithy twenty-five dollars, 
Why, Smithy now quickly will " give him away." 
The twins that the father now left at Mrs. Grundy's, 
If they are not called for this very day, 
To the show of the babies she says she will send them, 
Then there'll be the " Dickens" and deuce now to pay. 
Meet me at Stewart's, I've ten thousand dollars, 
Whatever you wish, love I'll buy for thee; 
The savings bank's bursted, tho' I'm not mistrusted, 
Oh, hasten, my darling, and fly now with me. 
Look out, there's detectives, and you are suspected, 
For you they are searching the city all o'er; 
Shave off your mustache, I've got your hard cash, 
So good-bye, my Charley, you'll see me no more.

SHOOT THE HAT. 
A. sung by TONY PASToR. 
Alr.—Immenseikoff. 
STRANGE sayings now are all the ga, 
Wherever you may be, 
I 
don't know how it is with you, 
But ' tis the case with me. 
Whatever kind of hat I 
wear, 
Let it be long or fiat, 
Same urchin in the street is sure 
To sing out, " shoot the hat." 
CHORUS. 
Shoot the beaver; shoot the hat, 
rt: makes a 
fellow look like a 
flat, 
Go where you will, you're sure that 
Some one wild sing out, " shoot the hat,' 
To a 
fancy ball 1 
went one night 
With my sweetheart Sarah Jane, 
Determined for to cut a 
dash 
In my best hat and cane, 
When on the road an Irishman, 
I 
think his name was Pat; 
Said, " Joe, dear friend. if I 
was you, 
Vue takka and shoot that hat." 
Shoot the beaver, & a, 
I 
went one night just for a 
walk 
Down - 
street I 
strayed, 
Of that by word to rid myself, 
For a 
new hat there I 
paid, 
At 
famous hat store 'twas, 
The latest st;le that's out, 
I'd scarcely got outside the door, 
When boys began to shout: 
Shoot the beaver, etc. 
So now my friends, my song is done, 
I 
will no longer talk; 
But say good night unto you all, 
So now my chalks Pll walki 
Before I 
go I'll ask of you 
A 
favor, which is, that 
it you should meet me in the street, 
Please don't shout shoot that hat, 
Shoot the beaver, etc.

THE PULPIT, THE PRESS & THE STAGE 
Written by JERRY COHAN for W ALLY PRICE MOTTO SINGER. 
•••••—.4. 0 
Of all the great levers that move this world, 
The principal ones are but three; 
And when my strange argument I 
unfold, 
Wise people with me will agree. 
The Newspaper ball keeps rolling on, 
While the Pulpit controls the mind; 
The theories that these powers expound, 
Are moving ones you'll find. 
The Theatre, too, does not fail to improve, 
The wisdom of every age; 
So the principal levers that make the world move, 
Are the Pulpit, the Press, and the Stage. 
Conviction is carried to every one, 
That this life's but a 
fleeting show; 
So Religion is the lever strong, 
To remind us of this, we know. 
Why the veriest hypocrite that can _talk, 
And wear sanctimonious ways, 
Let him enter the Pulpit, we listen, and oft 
are persuaded to believe all he says. 
The Christian, the Infidel, no matter what, 
The wicked, good, weak and strong:, 
Must acknowledge the Pulpit a 
lever of power, 
And it moves this world along. 
28 
THE PULPIT, 
THE PRESS, 
AND THE STAGE. 
CONTINUED. 
Next comes the Press, a 
most wonderful power, 
That we love, we fear and admire; 
It tells us the doings of every hour, 
And of all events as they transpire. 
Its reviewed by all classes, all nations and men, 
Propounding the wrong and right; 
Observe how the Press has improved the world, 
And brought us from darkness to light. 
It brings closer together all countries apart, 
Of all races of men tis the voice; 
The Press moves the world with unerring power, 
'Tis a 
lever in which we rejoice. 
Next comes the Stage, nature's mirror so true, 
'Tis both criticised, praised and condemned; 
But the Pulpit and Press has abuses, too, 
And the Stage has so much to commend. 
The grandest of minds were its patron's, I'll prove, 
Even those who have worshipped the Press; 
And spoke from the Pulpit the doctrine we love, 
Its Charities cannot grow less. 
So the Stage moves the world with the Pulpit and 
Press, 
In one how ' twill portray a 
whole age; 
And the principal levers that move the world, 
Are the Pulpit, the Press and the Stage. 
The Poor Serio-Comio. 
'Words by John McVeigh. 
To my friend Wm. Carter, and sung by him with I 'ea 
success. 
Oh ! the titles of songs of late are so used 
That it's hard a 
new one to find, 
But I've hit one at last and I 
think 't 
will please, 
So carefully bear it in mind. 
" 
Remember the poor," " You've children of your own, 
I'll admit to be very good logic, 
But the title I've given to the one I'll now sing, 
Is " Pity the poor serio-comic." 
CHORUS. 
See how she struggles with music and words, 
She acts like a 
colt on a 
frolic, 
She yells and she screeches then gets out of key, 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
About six months ago, a 
mechanic she was, 
In a 
hotel at the corner of the street, 
Till she formed the acquaintance of a 
bad actor so gay, 
Who tol d 
her she was charming and neat, 
lie put her on the stage with about a 
dozon more, 
And they say now that she takes a 
tonic, 
But she isn't to blame—sure she's working for fame, 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
CHORUS. 
Then help her along to the jail if ybu can, 
And her discords put to an end, 
Treat her with kindness, then slug her with Wicks, 
And prove your the dizzy's best friend. 
No' -; these poor serio-comics oft have nothing to wear, 
Except clreses that cost a 
hundred or two, 
And I'm sure that's enout,t, and I'll know you'll admit, 
To make any poor creature feel blue. 
Oh, they get by the week ten dollars or so, 
Which makes them feel badly and chronic, 
Vet they wear diamond rings that would swell a 
man'l 
head, 
Those poor dizzy serio-comics. 
CHORUS. 
Then always extend to them your hand or your foot, 
In kindness to them never lack, 
For the poor serio-comic don't know what she does, 
Let her alone and she'll surely come back.

Mrs. Brady, a 
widow lady, 
Has a 
daughter that I 
adore; 
I 
go to court her, across the water, 
Every Sunday afternoon at four; 
She sings so sweetly, she dresses so neatly, 
So like a 
fairy she trips the floor; 
She's good society, she's full of piety, 
And her mother keeps a 
little candy store, 
CHORUS: 
Dainty feet, measured beat, 
Trips the street; oh! so neat; 
Dresses sweet, what a 
treat, 
And her mother keeps a 
candy store; 
Her name is Norah, I 
do adore her, 
She's like an angel, my heart is so sore; 
She's like a 
daisy, she sets me crazy, 
And her mother keeps a 
little cOndy store. 
(Dance). 
Every Sunday, and every Monday. 
With the family I 
go to dine; 
And the daughter, I 
do escort her, 
Every evening till the clock strikes nine; 
One Summer evening, the moon was beaming 
I 
said I 
loved her as dear as life; 
She blushed completely and smiled so sweetly 
Yet she promised she'd be my darling wife.

And each a

Some turn a

While others turn a

Some hold a 
hand flushed with trumps, 
While others none can show. 
When Hearts are trumps we play for love, 
And pleasure decks the hour. 
No thought of sorrow checks our joys, 
In pleasant rosy bowers. 
When Diamonds chance to crown the pack, 
It's then men stake their gold. 
Large sums are often lost and won, 
By gamblers young and old.

I 
have a 
darling whom I 
adore, 
When he is near I 
am sighing no more; 
Lone arc the hours when we are apart, 
Fondly his image now dwells in my heart. 
Sweet hours of gladness we pass side by side, 
Waiting the day when I'll be his bride; 
Dearly he loves me, but never in vain, 
Soon he is coming to kiss me again. 
CHORUS. 
Kiss me again and say that you love me, 
Ever my darling remain; 
Kiss me again, and if I 
complain, 
Say that you love me and kiss me again. 
Sweet is the kiss that lovers can share, 
How it will cheer you and banish all care; 
Never refuse one, never be shy, 
Don't be too bashful and scream out " Oh, my!" 
Kisses are plenty and kisses are sweet, 
When you take one the dose you'll repeat; 
If with your lov'd one you'd always remain, 
come to his side and say, " kiss me again l" 
Kiss me again, ete.

It's the land of the beautiful shamrock so green, 
And the prettiest country that ever was seen. 
But the shamrOck by law is forbidden to grow

An ar.-ay of patriots determined you'll see, 
Who will fight Johnny Bull tillold Ireland is free. 
Oh, the boys won't forget '98, I 
am sure, 
When the widow and orphau was drove from the doot 
When Emmet, the patriot, was strung on a 
tree 
On that bonnie green isle way over the sea. 
Soon shall the day come when each valley and glen 
Shall re-echo the war-cry of bold Irish men. 
From oppressors and tyrants may they ever be free, 
On that bonnie green isle way ever the sea.

JULIA. 
AS 
sung by TONY RUMOR. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875, by A. J., 
VisriER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
I'LL sing in praise of Julia, a 
proper piece of stuff, 
A 
girl who knows her way about all over, 
She's been there once before, so of course she's up to snuff, 
And I'm the chap who'd like to be her lover; 
Although she seems to favor me somehow I 
cannot make 
An impression on her, though I 
often sound her, 
I 
really do believe, in fact a 
fever I 
will take, 
That there's not a 
living soul who can get round her. 
CHORUS. 
You might get round a 
corner, might get round a 
post, 
You might get round a 
square, and that's peculiar, 
You might get round the town, round the country, round the 
coast. 
But 'twill take you all your time to get round Julia. 
My Julia she is not a 
Westender, you must know, 
For Whitechapel is the place where she is housed up; 
Although she's very plebian, in fact I 
might say low; 
Her spirits they are high when they are roused up, 
Just touch her on her tender points, and you will quickly find 
She's not a 
girl on whom you'd ever practice, 
Although to hurt your feelings, she'd not be so unkind; 
But she'd give you a 
straight, because the fact is— 
You might get round a 
corner, etc. 
I 
often try to court her, but find it is no go, 
Although I 
have more influence than any, 
For, when I 
try it on, she quickly lets me know 
With her hands that she for me is one too many, 
Ah, but yet I 
live in hopes that I 
shall marry her some day, 
Although the date's beyond my calculation, 
I 
now know she really loves me, but she never tells me so, 
And so I 
tell you for your information. 
You might get rouucl a 
corner. ctc..

If they'd make it right away how much betteri wou:d o:

That's the song now to sing and the motto for the day, 
For life is but fleeting we haven't long to stay.

There's Tweed he is waiting for that sweet ny and bye, 
And Alurphy skipped the gutter and took it on the fly, 
And Mrs. Hicks she captured a " Lord" 01 high degree, 
And all upon the quiet they are singing merrily, 
Oh, the sweet right away, Oh, the sweet right away, 
That's the style all the while and the motto for he day, 
For life is but fleeting, Oh, make no delay, 
Let your joy: now be shining in the sweet right away.

I 
will tell you of a 
lady, 
One I 
love so well, 
Bonnets and ribbons she does sell; 
On the Bowery she owns a 
store, 
She has " Milliner" on the door, 
And Augustine Delia Clancey that's the bell'. 
Shure it's every Sunday night, 
It is my heart's delight 
To go up Miss Clancey for to see. 
A 
grand piano she plays so fine, 
To me she is divine, 
And all those lovely songs she sings to me. 
CHORUS. 
She sings, she sings Sweet Bye and Bye, 
And go to sleep my Baby Mine. 
She sings, she sings such pretty tunes, 
The girl I 
love I'll marry soon. 
There is Owen Smith and Grady, 
The Misses Scott and Doyle, 
Sitting in the parlor all so fine. 
Sure Smithy has comical talk, 
And such a 
funny walk, 
Which causes all the party for -to smile. 
When Miss Clancey does appear 
Such curious things you'll hear, 
" 
Mks Clancey, dear, you're looking all serene," 
She smiles and bows her head, 
To the piano she lightly treads, 
And all those loyely songs she sings to me. 
She sings, she sings, & c. 
THE MALONEY& 
Written by liAnaY MULLEN expressly for KEARNEY & POWERS. 
Sung and made popular by JAMES KEARNEY and circus. 
You're looking well this evening, 
We're glad to see you all; 
We've just came here from Ireland, 
Our own sweet Donegal; 
We're a 
rattling Irish couple, 
And we landed here last fall; 
Faith, we won't be easy, 
'Till we're back in Donegal. 
CHORUS: 
We are the Maloneys, 
We are the Maloneys; 
We're a 
rattling Irish couple, 
And we came from Donegal; 
We'll go hand and hand together, 
As around the town I'll roam; 
And where'er we go we'll ne'er forget; 
Our dear old Irish home. 
You'll always find us at it, 
For we're going day and night; 
At dancing Irish jigs or reels, 
It is our heart's delight; 
We take in all the fancy balls, 
And at spieling on the floor; 
Or dance an Irish Can Can, 
Upon an old barn door.

GOOD-EVENING. 
I 
HAD been dining rather late, 
The fact I 
think it best to state 
As I 
strolled out without a 
mate, 
One very pleasant evening, 
On fancy beats my steps were led— 
As onward through the streets I 
strayed, 
A 
lovely figure I 
saw ahead. 
Walked past and said: " Good evening." 
I 
felt a 
disappointed dunce, 
Not a 
word she answered in response, 
Though I 
repeated more than once: 
" 
Good-evening, Miss, good evening." 
At length she turned her head this way— 
And you can judge of my dismay— 
She was fifty-five if she was a 
day— 
And of course I 
said " Good-evening." 
My disappointment made me queer,. 
I 
stepped into an ale-house near. 
Addressed the bar-maid thus : " My dear, 
A 
glass of ale—good-evening." 
With sparkling eyes she an ale soon served— 
What is it makes me so unnerved? 
Close standing by me I 
observed 
My tailor: s'- 
Good-evening. 
35 
SPOKEN—How do you do, sir? I 
am always happy to see 
my tailor, especially when I 
don't owe him anything. 
Goo& 
evening, sir, good-evening 
his presence spoiled my wish to stay, 
I 
reached the door, then heard her say, 
" 
Please pay before you go away, 
Ten cents, sir then good-evening." 
" 
Pray, pardon Miss, I 
beg of you. 
I 
quite forgot." (and that was true.) 
The tailor says : " You often do; 
Good-evening, Snooze, good- evening." 
I 
felt a 
blush come o'er my face, 
At such a 
crowd and such disgrace— 
They shouted as I 
left the place, 
" 
Good-evening, Snooze, good evening." 
Policeman Jones, outside the door, 
Increased my misery more and more. 
He says, " I've watched your little game before, 
Get out of my beat— good evening." 
I 
left his beat, it did not suit, 
To argue with the stupid brute, 
Or hear him make me that salute: 
" 
Good-evening, Snooze, good-evening." 
Into a 
lane I 
made a 
dive, 
A 
fresh street reached more dead than live, 
And there again met Miss Fifty-five, 
Who simpered out, " Good-evening, John* 
good-evening."

GO GET PERMISSION OF MA. 
As sung by To 
PASTOR, 
Air—" I 
fancy I've seen you before," 
I ONCE had a 
sweetheart, a 
charming young girl, 
A 
beautiful young village queen, 
A 
rustic young beauty with hair all in curl, 
And only just turned seventeen, 
When I 
told her I 
loved her, her head she hung down, 
And her cheeks colored up like the rose, 
So I 
thought I 
would try and just steal a 
sly kiss 
From the spot where her victuals all goes. 
SPOIERN.—And I 
did try, but she stopped me and said: 
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission or ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before you attempt to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
While talking one night of what pleasure love brings, 
'Twas one pleasant evening in May, 
No dickey bird sailing through air on his wings 
E'er felt half so happy or gay, 
I 
asked my fair charmer if she would be mine, 
And begged she would then name the day 
When we should be married and settled for life, 
Tut listen to what she did say: 
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before we attempt to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
A. 
a 
Her ma did consent, and in one month from this 
Maria and I 
will be one; 
To my suit the old lady with pleasure said yes, 
Her consent it was easily won; 
"But you must agree, said her mother to me, 
To what I 
am now about to say; 
When married you calmly submit and agree 
To let us have all our own way." 
87 
SPOKEN.--ThiS quite stunned me for the moment ; b‘it re-
covering myself, I 
cooly replied : 
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before I 
agree to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
A 
little advice to you girls I'll now give, 
So listen to what I 
shall say : 
When sweethearts want to marry, and with you to live, 
Don't say, " I 
must have my own way," 
If you do, as sure as I 
am singing to-night, 
Old maids I 
am certain you'll die, 
For a 
man's but a 
fool, if he does'nt tell you, 
Or rather unto you reply: 
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before I 
agree to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma.

Haste my love my heart's repining, gently breathe thy tender

The dowsy bee lias ceased to hum, the daisie's closed its starry 
eye, 
The sun has sunk, the night has come, and here alone for thee 
I

The evening star is brightly shining, etc. 
What's that lightsome foot so near me, is it the leveret bound-

Will she come to- night and cheer me? my lonely wanderer's 
song. 
Is that a 
ghost that conies to fear me ? what's this sound that 
makes me start? 
Its only the wind that's whistling near me, with the beating 
of my heart. 
The evening star is brightly shining, etc, 
SPEAK, ONLY SPEAK. 
Sung with great success by the PEASLEVS. 
Why are you silent and sad, love, 
Filling my poor heart with pain?) 
Lives like your own should be glad, love, 
Smile on me sweetly again ; 
Surely I 
never can leave thee, 
Here with those tears on thy cheeks, 
What have I 
done thus to grieve thee ? 
Speak to me, love, only speak, 
CHORUS. 
Speak to me then, only speak, love, 
Why are those tears on thy cheeks, 
Give me the answer I 
seek, love, 
Speak to me, love, only speak. 
Lives like your own cannot live, love, 
Always in sorrow and pain, 
Whisper you gladly forgive, love, 
Kiss and be happy again; 
Cease then your weary repining, 
Banish the tear from thy cheek, 
With my arms round you entwining, 
Speak to me, love, only speak, 
Speak to me, then, etc.

STOKES' VERDICT. 
Written and sung by W ILLIAM J. 
SCANLON. 
Am.—"Nevor Go Back on the Poor." 
if you ' 11 listen awhile, I'll sing you a 
song 
About this "gloriousland of the free," 
And the " difference" I'll show ' twixt the rich and the poor, 
In a " trial by the jury," you see. 
If you've plenty of "stamps," you can hold up your head, 
And walk out from your own prison door, 
But they'll hang you up high if you've no friends or gold— 
Let the " rich" go, but hang up the poor! 
CHORUS. 
In the trials for murder we 've had now-a-days 
The rich ones get off swift and sure, 
While they 've thousands to pay to the jury and judge, 
You can bet they'll go back on the poor! 
Let me speak of a 
man who s 
now dead in his grave---
A 
good man as ever was born--
Jim Fisk, he was called, and his money he gave 
To the outcast the poor and forlorn. 
We all know he loved both women and wine, 
But his heart it was right, I 
am sure; 
Though he lived like a "prince" in a 
palace so fine, 
Yet he never went back on the poor! 
CHORUS. 
If a 
man was in trouble, Fisk helped him along 
To drive the " grim wolf" from the door ;-
He strove to do right, though be may have done wrong 
But he never went back on the poor! 
Jim Fisk was a 
man, wore his heart on his sleeve,' 
No matter what people would say, 
And he did all his deeds (both the good and the bad) 
in CI: broad opeu light of the day.

[SPOKES'. 
VERDICT.--COntinucd.] 
With his grand " six-in-hand" on the beach at Long Branch, 
Ile cut a " big dash" to be sure, 
But " Chicago's great fire" showed the world that Jim Fisk, 
With his " wealth," still remembered the poor? 
CHORUS. 
When the telegram came that the homeless that night 
-Were starving to death, slow but sure, 
his " Lightning Express," manned by noble Jim Fisk, 
Flevi to feed all her hungry and poor? 
Now what do you think of this " trial" of Stokes, 
Who murdered this 2rIQ.nd f 
the poor? 
When such men get free, is them anyone safe 
If they step from outsie:e their own door? 
Is there one law for the :: oor and one for the rich? 
It seems so, at kast so I 
Say; 
If they hang up the :
or, why---danm. K.?--the rich 
Ought to swing up the very aarac.s 'FM;

Vigilance Comm'Aee 
raiso or our shore, 
And take the law in - ur own haDdr.;! 
Of all the strangest girls on earth, 
I 
think my girl's the one; 
You know she has peculiar ways, 
And quite devoid of fun. 
She never sees a 
joke of mine, 
Whenever humor flows, 
But gives me a 
disdainful look 
And quite turns up her nose. 
SPOKEN—Some girls like a 
little joke, you know, but mina 
don't, she turns her nose up at it. 
I 
think she works it on 
the same principle as this (
turning up nose with jinger). 
CHORUS. 
Some girls do, and some girls don't, 
Some girls will, but my girl won't; 
I 
tried very hard to see if she would, 
She said she really couldn't, and I 
don't think she could 
I 
took my love to see the play, 
As other fellahs do; 
And thought that she'd enjoy herself, 
She cried the mihole night through. 
And when we reached the s' reet again, 
Some oysters I 
proposed, 
But she said, " No, not me, young man," 
Still turning up her nose. 
SPOKEN—Up 
it went again at three dozen of t'6 best 
:Saddle Rocks, just think of that. 
To see a 
girl turn up hem 
nose at five cents a 
time. I 
said, " Well, my love, if yos 
43 
won't have any supper, we will have a 
cab and go home." 
She replied, " No, young man, no four-wheeled cabs for me 
at this time of night." 
Some girls do, &c. 
We met one Sunday afternoon, 
For a 
day in Central Park; 
And when we mounted " One tree hill" 
We had, well, say a 
lark ! 
'Georgina said, " You know, young man, 
Some girls prefer a 
stroll ; 
Not me, when I'm in Central Park 
I 
dearly love a 
roll!" 
SPOKEN—NOW, there's an extraordinary girl for you. 
Of 
course, I 
wanted to take her for a 
nice quiet lover's walk in 
some shady lane, but she said she'd prefer a 
roll. 
Then I 
wanted to talk to her of love, romance, and poetry, but no, 
she said she'd " sooner have a 
good dinner." 
Well, 
Some girls do, &e. 
Not long ago my uncle died 
And left me fifty pounds; 
As soon as I 
received the news 
My joy it knew no bounds. 
I 
thought, wel1,I will marry now, 
So I 
at once proposed; 
But when I 
mentioned the amount 
Up went

DON'T CATCH A BUTTERFLY . 
Never was a 
man without a 
little boy 
Just try to put the matter in your eye! 
You may not all of you believe the fact, 
But little boys grew bigger bye and bye, 
Roaming in the fields or over in the park, 
Before I 
was too big I 
used to try, 
As quick as any merry lark, 
Or little dog with snappy bark, 
To catch at a 
butterfly. 
CHORUS: 
Oh I 
now boys and girls beware 
And learn to mind your eye, 
While you are well enough 
Let well enough alone 
And don't catch a 
butterfly. 
When I 
sowed my oats I 
set up for a 
sport 
And tho't it nice to take a 
drink and try 
J` To bet my money on the bobtailed nag," 
But " Mountain Girl" was quicker on the fly; 
So I 
told my " Ma " just how I 
had been hurt, 
Said she to me" my son, oh mind your eye! 
Just every time you will I 
esort 
To bet your money like a 
sport, 
You're after a 
butterfly," 
Chorus. 
Then I 
did resolve to try and be a 
man— 
A 
girl she shot an arrow in my eye; 
My heart went pi-ti-pi-ti-pat and so 
I 
feared, oh, dear I 
I 
was a 
butterfly! 
"Pretty 3Iollie Jane," said I, " oh be my Queen!" 
Said she, I 
will be-your., until I 
die."— 
'Twas walking out upon the green, 
When nothing but the stars were seen, 
I 
caught not a 
butterfly 
Chorus. 
Don't Forget to be Kind to the Boys' 
Written expreasly for LITTLE BOB by BEN DODGZ 
There is something which I 
wish to mention to you, 
While trying to please with my song. 
Some solid advice unto you I 
will give; 
Please listen its not very long. 
Your attention I11 call to the poor little boys 
You will meet on the street every day. 
Do not spurn them aside with a 
curse or a 
kick, 
When by chance they are thrown in your way. 
CHORUS. 
Don't think they're too small to be noticed at all, 
Let them share in your sorrows and joys. 
• 
Their love will repay your kindness some day, 
Don't forget to be kind to the boys. 
If a 
poor boy accosts you while trying to earn, 
By honest means but half a 
dime, 
If you have it to spare, buy a 
paper at once, 
Or invest when he proffers a 
shine. 
He has loved ones at home who upon him depend, 
For the poor crusts of bread which they eat; 
And the brave honest boy to provide them with food, 
Has to labor each day in the street. 
Don't think they're too small, &c. 
The greatest of statesmen were once small like me, 
And no one can tell what's in store 
For a 
boy in the future if upright he proves, 
No matter if now he is poor. 
So unheeded don't pass the advice which I 
give; 
But by your applause let me see, 
That you promise to ever be kind to the boys, 
And I 
hope you'll begin here with me. 
CHORUS 
Don't think I'm too small to be noticed at all, 
But kindly give me your applause. 
My love will repay your kindness some day, 
Don't forget I 
am one of the boys.

Oh, oh, I

Yonder, yonder is her father's house. 
And that's where she lives.

AS I 
strolled out by chance one day, 
'Twas in the summer time, 
I 
first beheld a 
fairy form, 
And since I've called her mine; 
Some flowers she was bending o'er— 
I 
begged of her a 
few; 
The glance exchanged was one of love, 
Down where the pansies grow.—Dance 
CHORus. 
And we whispered and we lau bed so free, 
And of course we were as happy as could be, 
Oh her smiles they are as bright as the rays 
Of the sun that loves the dew; 
Two hearts were moulded into one, 
Down where the pansies grew. 
The favor asked was but a 
bud, 
A 
rose that she posessed ; 
The little flower love implied, 
And that I'd half confess'd; 
Her cheeks were blushing like the leaf, 
In all its rosy hue; 
That even:ng I 
exchanged a 
kiss, 
Down where the...pansies grw. 
And we whispered, 
The flowers faded, but her love 
Remains as bright and green; 
And since the day I've called her mine, 
How happy we have been; 
So now the story I 
have told, 
In all its joys to you, 
How I 
strolled into happinsss, 
Down where the pansies grew,

I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
The place I 
want to see, 
The place I 
used to wander, 
It was so dear to me; 
I 
was happy with old massa, 
When living in the lane, 
So I'se traveling back to Georgia. 
I 
will say goodbye to you. 
CHORUS: 
I'm traveling back,—Sym. 
Yes, traveling back,—Sym. 
I'm gwine back again, 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
For to see my home again. 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
The place where I 
was born; 
Where I 
used to hoe the cotton, 
The sugar cane and corn; - 
I'm getting old and feeble, 
And tired of roaming, too; 
So I'm gwine back to Georgia, 
I 
will say good-bye to you.

Dedicated to JOHN Barzion, the rising Irish Comique. by BEN COLLIN& 
Sung by Jso. REILLY. 
In Erin's Isle—the shamrock's home, 
A 
darling fond and true, 
lilly fair, with golden hair, 
And cheeks of the brightest hue. 
I 
soothed her sorrow, bade farewell, 
Murmurred, ' Katie, think of me," 
Grasped her father's hand and left 
To cross the stormy sea. 
Katie, darling, think of me as always by your side, 
And never fear, my colleen dear, 
I'll return for you, my bride. 
CHORUS. 
Katie, mine, when the winter wind is snarling, 
The love ot my colleen will cheer me always, 
Think of our parting sorrow and starting, 
I'll remember you, too, in the long summer days. 
I 
often think of the happy days, 
When Kate and I 
did roam, 
By the old mill that's running still, 
Where the waters dance and foam, 
It was there I 
met her in the evening, 
Throwing pebbles at the tide, 
Homeward bound, what happy moments, 
She was by my side , 
I 
am thinking of her al: day, 
Long My Cushla Gm a 
Machree, 
And dreaming of her lovely face, 
It fills my heart with glee. 
What Talmage Did Not See. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, with immense success. 
Air: "Castle in the Air." 
Mr. Talmage late to New York came to see eac-h 
wondrous 
sight, 
To find out if the world went wrong, and make the matter 
right; 
He visited each curious place where " Life" did find a 
home, 
In fact he had a 
midnight spree as he this town did roam; 
I 
do not wish much fault to find, of him to make complaint, 
But think at home by his fireside would have been better for 
a " Saint !" 
No doubt he saw many things of the easy kind and free, 
But some misery he could help to cure, he had not eyes to see. 
He did not see our working girls as the snow was falling fast, 
Creep home to attic, cramped and small, thro' the chilly 
wintry blast ; 
Her wretched home of poverty is roofless o'er hcr 
Her heart is bleak and cold and sad ! her meal a 
crust of 
bread. 
He did not see the twinkling stars shine down from the blue 
sky, 
Upon her upturned face of woe as she lay there to die; 
Heard not her suffering cry .7:2 " help !" as her soul trom 
bondage free; 
Sped swiftly to the unknown shore I 
THAT Talmage -lid not 
see. 
Continued. 
He did not see our laboring men in life's sad battle beat, 
Working from daylight until dark that food their wives might 
eat ; 
He did not see dark hunger's cloud grow denser every day, 
Nor capital, with iron hand, drag down each workman's 
pay; 
Ile did not see each savings bank our poor, hard earnings 
lie went where luxury abounds in the halls of gilded sin; 
The outcasts of the gutter, he in scorn did let them be, 
No hand he them reached out to save, such sights he did not 
see. 
I 
have often pondered in my mind, he had better go to 
work, 
And purify his own good town before he tries New York; 
/ 
never thought that Brooklyn was the long sought " promised 
land," 
Or even that its parsons were the famous Gideon's band. 
I 
hope before he next starts out in search of sin to roam, 
He'll use his purifying broom, and sweep much nearer 
home; 
Or if be must keep on his course and will not let us be, 
He'll give a 
dime and not a 
tract when misery he does see.

You'll Never Run the Engine Unless 
You have the Steam. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, with :great success, throughout the United 
States. 
There's many maxims in this world, 
And practice makes them true; 
But the one that I've invented, 
You'll find it good and new; 
Man may be likened to a 
boat, 
Afloat on life's great stream, 
But he'll never run the engine 
Unless he has the steam. 
CHORUS. 
Then keep the fires a 
burning, boys. 
You'll find the wheel will turn, 
You'll seldom meet with accidents 
If the motive power you learn. 
Upon life's steam gauge keep an eye, 
Don't fall asleep and dream, 
For you'll never run the engine 
Unless you keep up steam. 
Look at the home where rich sunshine 
Makes every thing so bright, 
Then gaze upon that poor man's hut, 
Where all is dark at night. 
" 
58 
YOU'LL NEVER RUN THE ENGINE UNLESS YOU 
HAVE THE STEAM. 
Continued. 
His wife lies dying on the straw, 
For bread his children scream, 
'Tis hard to run life's engine far, 
If he hasn't got much steam. 
Then keep the fires, &c. 
Columbus many years ago, 
Did ask the Queen of Spain, 
To fit him out with men and ships, 
To sail the unknown main; 
Some instinct told him there was land 
That never had been seen; 
Now we run America, for 
Columbus gave us steam. 
Then haughty England made a 
yoke, 
And brought it to this land, 
But soon found out ' twould never fit 
That brave and fearless band. 
For the engine was commanded 
By Washington and Greene, 
And we owe our independence to 
Their patriotic steam. 
Then keep the fires, &c.

Now Moses being my christian name, I 
used to feel afraid, 
And dreading something awful I 
for hours awake have laid, 
Sometimes I'd cry myself to sleep but horrid things I 
dreamed, 
For naughty ghosts at my bedside glared at me while they 
screamed: 
Ciio:—Where was Moses when the light went out, &c.

Upon the nurse I 
split and she was kindly asked to leave, 
But Moses Muggins married her for which we did not grieve, 
I 
met her in the street when she had just two days been wed, 
And didn't she warm my jacket when I 
innocently said:

Some twenty years passed by before I 
heard the phrase again, 
Alone with a 
young lady I 
was riding in the train, 
We rushed into a 
tunnel and when all was pitchy dark, 
My lively little lady friend gave vent to this remark: 
eno:—Where was Moses when the light went out, &c. 
5. 
Now when once more the light of day we saw to her I 
said, 
As you've 'waken'd up old memories you're the girl I'd like to 
wed, 
We're married now and six fine boys amuse us every night, 
And they never fail to ask when their Pa puts out the light,:

" Original:' 
The moon was up and the river did shine, 
We all started off for to have a 
good time; 
We sent for the girls and they all did agree 
To dance till the morning and have a 
good spree. 
First came I,ize, and then came Sal, 
Hau,ring on the arm of big- foot Hal: 
They stnted up the fiddle and figures did call, 
In a 
grand double-shuffle at the flat- boat 
Cnonus: 
Then its oh, my! let me die, 
Mille I 
hear the music sweet; 
Oh, dear! can't you hear 
The sound of du.ncing feet. 
[Repeat. 
We danced so long the niggers did shake, 
Some hollered supper and they all made a 
break; 
They jumped on the table like a 
lot of loose fleas, 
And the yellow gals sat on the colored men's knees. 
They eat hog meat till they couldn't eat more, 
The boat got a 
sinking, then we shoved her ashore; 
Big Liza fainted and in the water did fall, 
And she floated on her bustle at the flat- boat ball. 
(Chorus). 
We all walked home as the sun did rise, 
Some got sleepy and they shut their eyes; 
We led them along like a 
lot of lost sheep, 
And sang 'ern a 
song that rocked 'em to sleep. 
But old Bill Carter and young Sam Glim, 
They got in a 
muss and the fight did begin: 
They pulled out razors and on the ground did fall, 
Oh, they carved each other at the flat-boat ball. 
(Chorus).

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
ft is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called 
Ii1011PrY DUMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear, 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at . home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
