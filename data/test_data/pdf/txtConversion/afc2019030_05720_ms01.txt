And thank you very much for talking with me today. You know you’re being recorded? 
 
SW: 
Yes, I know I’m being recorded. 
 
LG: 
Okay. And for the record can you give me your birth year? 
 
SW: 
My birth year is 1968. 
 
LG: 
Okay, thank you. 
 
 
 
To kick us off, can you just talk about where you went to medical school and residency, 
please? 
 
SW: 
Yep. I went to medical school at Northwestern University, in Chicago, Illinois. And I 
completed the four years there, and then I came out here, to Salt Lake City, for my 
residency, and then stayed on for my fellowship,as well. 
 
LG: 
And what years was that? 
 
SW: 
My residency was in ’97 through 2001; and then my fellowship in Child Psychiatry was 
2001 to 2003. 
 
LG: 
And what year did you enter medical school? 
 
SW: 
1997 was medical school. 
 
LG: 
1997. 
 
SW: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Okay. How did you decide to become a doctor? 
 
SW: 
Oh, that’s an interesting story for me. I kind of had a circuitous route. I thought I always 
wanted to be a physician, ever since I was a little kid – I talked about it all the time. And 
then once I got to college, I was in a liberal arts college, and I discovered what the liberal 
arts were.  
 
 
So, I quickly diverted from my path of pre-med and asked my pre-med advisor about the 
fashion industry and philosophy – and he thought it was time for me to get a new advisor, 
so [laughs] –  
 
 
So, I ended up graduating in philosophy and then I had a minor in math. And I also was 
interested in the fashion industry. And I did that for a few years, and there was always 
this gnawing part within me about going to medical school.  
 
[02:00]

So, I ended up going back to get my post-bac degree (or not my post-bac degree, but my 
post-bac classes), and did all my prerequisites within about a year (about 15 months), and 
was working part-time. And I told myself – I’d apply to three medical schools, and if I 
got in, that was great; and if I didn’t, it was not meant to be. 
 
 
And when I got accepted, then I really didn’t know what I was going to do because I was 
also had put an acceptance on hold at Medill School of Journalism (for their marketing 
and advertising graduate program). So, I had to kind of flip a coin. 
 
 
And it was one of my very dear friends from high school, she said to me, “Susie, if I had 
that opportunity, I know exactly what I would choose.” And I was kind of angry at her, 
because I knew what she would have chosen, and I was really afraid about all the 
commitment ahead of me. And I knew that I needed to go to med school, but that was – I 
was pretty afraid of everything that I knew it was going to demand of my life.  
 
LG: 
What was it, specifically, that you were afraid of? 
 
SW: 
Really all the time commitment, and I come from a long history of physicians – so, I’m 
third generation of physicians on my paternal side, and we also have some physicians on 
my maternal side as well. And I was just really afraid of all of the grueling hours. In all 
honesty, I thought I couldn’t possibly be smart enough, but then everybody kept telling 
me, “Well you got into medical school.” [Laughs] 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about what medical school was like? 
 
[03:58] 
 
SW: 
Sure. So, medical school for me was a little bit different than the traditional track student, 
because most students in med school go right from undergrad directly into medical 
school. And because I was doing something completely different, I also didn’t have as 
much science background as a number of other pre-med students had.  
 
 
So, that transition was a pretty eye-opening experience – it was like baptism by fire. And 
the workload, right out of the gate, was quite overwhelming for me, because I didn’t have 
a whole lot of the additional science background that a number of my fellow students had 
(fellow classmates). 
 
 
But I was in the first class at Northwestern that had an integrated program – and that’s 
what really, really spoke to me at my particular school. They had small group classes – 
we definitely had some of the traditional lecture-style with the basic sciences. But having 
the one-on-one learning was just an incredible experience. So, I quickly found my footing 
that way, and was able to make some in-roads then in figuring out all the other additional 
sciences that I did need to know, too. 
 
LG: 
What’s an integrated program? 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 4 
 
 
SW: 
An integrated program was set up as – we had four different colleges (that’s what they 
called it): they divided our class into quarters, and that was just a random division. And 
each of those colleges had a mentor (another physician), and that person then became 
truly our mentor throughout the next four years.  
 
 
And then within the little college – so, it’s roughly about 45 people in each of the 
colleges. Then we were also divided into smaller groups. So, we had work groups, where 
it was 10-12 students, and we were always working on understanding physiology, 
understanding patient problems, understanding how to even approach a patient.  
 
 
So it was a lot of very intimate, hands-on learning where we were applying, right from 
the get-go, all of the hardcore sciences that we were learning in lecture hall.  
 
[06:35] 
 
 
And I have a funny joke (or not a joke), but a funny experience from that [laughs]. Our 
very first pod, or our very first team meeting we had to figure out what the medical 
terminology meant without having a medical dictionary. We were disallowed to have a 
medical dictionary, we had to figure out – in any way that we possibly could, within this 
hour period of time – what the patient was experiencing. 
 
 
So, [laughs] we had the word “analgesic,” which most people may know (or some people 
may know) means it’s something to take away pain. But none of us – all of us were very 
naïve – and we all thought it had to do something with the anus. [Laughs] Our mentor 
came by, and he laughed so hard – so, that was a really great way to kick off my medical 
school training. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
LG: 
That’s really funny. 
 
SW: 
But I’ve learned very [??] how to use a medical dictionary, and know medical 
terminology quite well now [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about the workload – you said earlier you were a little afraid to go 
into medical school because of the workload? 
 
SW: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
For people who have never done medical school, can you talk a little bit about that? 
 
SW: 
Yeah; the workload is – it is pretty extreme. And I think because of having had some 
other life experience, I also knew what it meant to maintain a balance, and not just only 
be a bookworm. And that piece, I think, is really important when we’re looking at what is 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 5 
 
that workload, and how do you also end up maintaining a sense of self while you’re in 
medical school. 
 
 
And I guess that’s probably the biggest fear that I had: that I would lose my sense of self 
while I was there, because of all the workload. And for me, it was pretty much non-stop 
studying, and the hours were just incredibly intense.  
 
 
Because I was a post-bac, and knew a couple other post-bacs in my class (so, they had 
other life experiences too), some of them had been through other graduate school 
programs, including law school, including going after their PhDs. And very consistently 
everyone said that medical school was the most demanding and rigorous and 
overwhelming of any other graduate programs.  
 
 
 
So, it’s really hard to explain what that feels like, but it was pretty much just a lot of 
sleepless nights, just trying to layer, and layer, and layer all of the different sciences, and 
trying to understand how do these really integrate.  
 
[09:40] 
 
 
And how I like to study is to really hold on to that information and really allow it to 
percolate so I can really apply it down the road. There are definitely a number of medical 
students who are really great at studying and taking tests, but really lose that level of 
integration. And for me, I feel like I really need to study to really integrate that.  
 
 
And some of those things that I learned back in my first and second year, in terms of 
physiology, I still use those principles today in my practice.  
 
LG: 
Did you feel like there were medical students that lost their sense of self? 
 
SW: 
That’s a great question. I would say that a lot of medical students do suffer from anxiety, 
from depression, from addiction. And that’s something that’s really not talked about very 
much.  
 
 
I would say in the last (probably) five to 10 years it’s becoming a little bit more of a 
focus for larger institutions, and also for residency programs – to really help support the 
health and the resiliency for medical students.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. And would that be related to the workload, then? 
 
SW: 
Definitely the workload; it really is just non-stop studying, and – yeah, at least that’s how 
I experienced it. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. So, one of the most well-known classes in medical school is gross anatomy –  
 
SW: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 6 
 
LG: 
To the public, that’s the one people usually think of –  
 
SW: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
When they think of medical school; can you talk about gross anatomy a little bit? 
 
SW: 
Oh, I loved gross anatomy, just absolutely loved it: I had a great team, and we had five to 
the cadaver. And I have to say – our group really functioned very well; we were very 
supportive of each other. And we had a lot of fun, even though [laughs] it was – it could 
be pretty nasty.  
 
[11:50] 
 
 
We found a pacemaker in our cadaver, so that was kind of a fun thing. We opened up the 
chest, and it was –  
 
 
I would say the test (at the end), that was incredibly challenging, because you had to be 
able to identify tissue that was completely misplaced, so out of the cadaver, and you had 
to be able to identify what kind of tissue it is, or what kind of bone it was.  
 
 
So, there was just an incredible amount of learning that needed to go along with the fun 
part, which was the dissection. 
 
LG: 
So you enjoyed the dissection. 
 
SW: 
I, yeah – I loved dissection. I actually loved my surgical rotations so much I really 
debated if I wanted to go into surgery, because I’m very dexterous, and I’m also very 
visual. And I did a fantastic job on my rotations in surgery, but I also didn’t want the 
lifestyle along with that. But yeah, that started (definitely) when I was in the cadaver 
room.  
 
LG: 
Any funny cadaver stories from gross anatomy? 
 
SW: 
Oh. You know, I just really remember enjoyment, not necessarily the – like a funny story 
that came up through there, yeah.  
 
LG: 
How did you decide to go into psychiatry? 
 
SW: 
So, when I entered med school I kind of thought that I would – I was debating between 
psychiatry and then also pediatrics. And I had worked – while I was doing my post-bac, I 
was working as a unit secretary at the Children’s Hospital in Chicago. And I just – I 
really loved the pediatricians, and I loved the kids. And so that was a debate back and 
forth for quite some time. 
 
 
And then when I did my psychiatry rotation, I actually hated it. And I thought, “Wow, I 
really am barking up the wrong tree here.” But what I hated about it was that I was on an 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 7 
 
in-patient unit, and I really didn’t have a whole lot of stimulation, really, from the 
resident (who was my supervisor at the time).  
 
[14:10] 
 
 
And it was only by the grace of God (I’d say) that I bumped into one of my mentors just 
before I was ready to submit my applications for pediatrics. And she asked why I hadn’t 
come around to talk to her about programs. And I told her about this miserable 
experience I had at psychiatry, and I said you know, “It’s just not for me.” 
 
 
And just that night she said, “There’s a fantastic lecture coming; please come to this local 
chapter meeting.” 
 
 
So, being a hungry student, I went to the meeting because I knew there was going to be 
food. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SW: 
And when I saw the neuro images that this lector was discussing I knew that that’s where 
I needed to be. And he was looking at functional imaging about the brain, and how 
different psychiatric processes come to be. And this was, you know, in the infancy of 
functional imaging. And I changed all my applications that night, and started to pursue 
psychiatry again.  
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
SW: 
Yeah. And I was so grateful that I bumped into her. And then I ended up doing my sub-I 
(or a sub-internship) in child psychiatry, and I knew I found home for me. 
 
LG: 
Interesting. Well can you talk about the residency – what the residency is, as compared to 
medical school? 
 
SW: 
Um-hmm, yep. So, I did my residency in Salt Lake City, Utah, here at the University of 
Utah. And I just want to back up for a second – I actually chose my residency (I knew I 
wanted to move out west), and I chose it by getting off the plane and seeing how 
amazingly beautiful it was here.  
 
 
And certainly I put other factors into that mix, and I was really looking at a couple of the 
big-name schools out west. And I was just so incredibly impressed by, even though it was 
a small program here, by the rigor and the access to attendings.  
 
 
And that becomes really important: having that access and mentorship in a residency 
program, especially a residency program like psychiatry, where there’s a lot of intricacies 
and subtleties that become very essential to really best treat your patients, and really 
understand the comprehensive nature of their issues.  
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 8 
 
[16:45] 
 
 
So anyway, I was really, really impressed by everything that I saw when I was out here 
for my interviews. And then when day one came, I really (again) felt like I was home. I 
loved working with patients who had incredibly complex mental health as well as 
physical health issues. And I really had such a fun time, actually, on the psychiatric in-
patient unit, because I had incredible mentorship.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Can you talk a little bit about what that was like? 
 
SW: 
Yeah. The mentorship – I just have such fond memories of incredible attendings. And for 
those of you who don’t know, attending means (in a training program it means) kind of 
like the top dog physician. So, then they have residents-in-training below them.  
 
 
And when you have a really great attending, they are able to convey the pearls of 
everything that they have learned in a very succinct manner. So, you really having this 
very rich experience of principles jumping off of text books and being able to see that in 
application in real life.  
 
 
And especially in psychiatry, again, that becomes really important because it’s so hard to 
describe personality on a piece of paper. But being able to have an attending point out 
very subtle behaviors, and what you need to look for as the next thing in order to get to a 
diagnosis so you can really understand how to best treat a person becomes essential. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SW: 
So, having that truly one-on-one interaction with the attendings out here was just an 
absolute prize for me.  
 
[18:48] 
 
LG: 
Nice. Can you talk a little bit about what it was like to work with patients on the in-
patient unit? 
 
SW: 
Sure. Yeah, the in-patient unit – it’s intense: it can be really, really intense with 
psychiatric illness. You never know what to expect, as I’m sure like on any in-patient 
unit, you never really know what to expect – whether it’s in the ICU, or post-surgical.  
 
 
But dealing with people who are really not able to think effectively, sometimes, or whose 
personalities might change on a dime; or people who are really suffering psychiatric 
illness because of actually physical health issues – it really becomes a constant challenge 
to assess, and to make sure a person is psychiatrically stable, or sometimes even 
physically stable as well. 
 
 
The hours are very long on the in-patient unit. But what seems like it should just be a 
quick check-in on a daily basis – it’s not just that 15 to 60-minute check-in with a patient, 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 9 
 
but it’s then at least twice that amount of time of everything that has to go into taking 
care of that patient: coordinating with other disciplines.  
 
 
On the in-patient unit, it wasn’t uncommon to have multi-disciplinary groups to help a 
person stabilize. So, coordinating with cardiology, or gastro-intestinal physicians, 
coordinating with the psychiatric nurses, pharmacy – it really becomes quite an 
orchestration.  
 
 
So, the time is very, very demanding if you want to do a good job.  
 
[20:50] 
 
LG: 
Can you think of any particular memorable moments during your residency? 
 
SW: 
Oh, [laughs] yeah. 
 
LG: 
I’m sure there’s a lot [laughs]. 
 
SW: 
Yeah – no, there are a lot. In one of my all-time favorites: I was in my fourth year, I was 
chief resident for my program. And I was on the consult service, and I got a phone call to 
come down to the ER to see (I’ll call her) Mrs. Jones. And Mrs. Jones was brought to the 
ER after she stepped off a train as it started leaving the station. And they didn’t know if 
she had a suicide attempt. And she was very incoherent, so they also didn’t know if there 
was something else that had happened to her. 
 
 
So, I went down to the ER to look for Mrs. Jones. I went into her room –  
 
 
Oh, I have to back up here for a second. They also told me, “And don’t be alarmed: she’s 
dancing around in her room, naked.” [Laughs] 
 
 
So, I went to her room, and there was no Mrs. Jones there. There was nothing of evidence 
that she had even been there. So I thought at first that there was some kind of joke being 
played on me. And they said, “No, she’s in there.”  
 
 
I said, “No, she’s not.” [Laughs] 
 
 
And then we at least had found out by that point that she was traveling cross-country 
from, I think it was the Midwest somewhere, by train to go visit her friend on the west 
coast. And her son, I remember, had been contacted already. So, now we have a missing 
person and we are responsible for this missing person. 
 
 
And I approached security, and I said, “You’ve got to help me find this woman. She can’t 
be that far, she’s like in her 70s. And she’s either naked, or she put her clothes on 
[laughing] and she has her bags with her.” 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 10 
 
 
So, as I’m going down the long hallway (the main hallway) at the U, I see this little, old 
lady, and she’s carrying her suitcase. And I said, “Oh, Mrs. Jones! How nice to see you.” 
And I happen to have my white coat on, with my stethoscope over my shoulders. And she 
said to me, “Oh, doctor – it’s so wonderful to see you again.”  
 
 
And I just happened to be standing by the bank of elevators that went right up to the 
locked unit on the psych unit [laughing]. So, I said, “Come in – let’s go chat in my 
office.” And she followed me up there, and we got her behind secure doors. So, that was 
really funny and very [laughs], very tense time too. 
 
[23:36] 
 
LG: 
Yeah? Was she naked? 
 
SW: 
She was not naked, no. No, she was clothed by then [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
That’s a really funny story. 
 
 
So, you mentioned at first you were wondering if somebody had played a joke on you – 
do people play jokes on each other? 
 
SW: 
I would say not about patient care, but yeah – we had a fun group of residents. And oh 
my gosh, we had a very fun group [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Can you think of any jokes that you ever played on each other? 
 
SW: 
Gosh, jokes that we played – oh, I’m at a blank [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Okay. That’s a very cute story though; that’s a very cute story. 
 
 
So, that brings up an interesting question though – can you talk a little bit about what it 
means to be responsible for a patient? 
 
SW: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
I mean, because you said that was a scary moment. 
 
SW: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
When you realized she might not be there. Can you talk a little bit about what physician 
responsibility is for people who don’t know? 
 
SW: 
Um-hmm, yep. That’s a really sobering question. And my first experience of that was 
actually writing my first prescription. And after I got my medical license, and now I’m 
responsible on my own, I don’t have a supervising resident over me – I just remembered 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 11 
 
having that twinge of anxiety about writing a basic prescription, that I had written 
previously (you know, while I was still a medical student).  
 
 
So, the responsibility now shifts to, “Holy cow – I’m in charge of somebody else’s life.” 
And you know, a simple prescription for Prozac – it may sound like nothing, and a lot of 
people think that it’s a nothing thing; but you also don’t know if that person could have 
an adverse reaction, if you are going to be able to assess that. And every medication we 
put into our mouth (whether it’s even an over the counter medication that we take): it can 
have serious, adverse effects on our body.  
 
[25:51] 
 
 
So, when I wrote that first prescription, I just said a little prayer, and said, “Okay,” kind 
of a blessing over the rest of my career, that I would always take very seriously the health 
and all the nuances that go into health for all of my patients.  
 
 
But in psychiatry, in particular, as one might imagine, we’re also dealing with very 
chronically life and death situations, because people (very often) are struggling with 
issues like suicide, or self-harm behavior. They might be dealing with psychosis, so 
they’re not thinking things through effectively, and they could inadvertently harm 
themselves, or harm somebody else.  
 
 
When I expand that a little bit further, looking at the responsibility of taking care of 
someone who has a really severe eating disorder – that is an enormous magnitude of 
responsibility and care. And these are people who are very sick. And no one wants to be 
sick. 
 
 
But when you’re dealing with an organ like the brain, that we don’t have a lot of 
understanding about (even to this day), it makes it incredibly challenging sometimes to 
convince people that they need to have the help that they need. So, that becomes yet 
another layer of challenge that a psychiatrist faces on (pretty much) a daily basis. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about the kind of work you do now? 
 
SW: 
Um-hmm. I am – so, I’m trained in child and adolescent psychiatry, and adult psychiatry. 
And I have also expanded my training in addiction medicine. And right now, I just 
opened up a center for professionals who have addiction issues, because we don’t have 
anything like that in our state, to really support professionals (and most people go out of 
state).  
 
[28:08] 
 
 
But how I got into addiction medicine was actually because of my child psychiatry 
training, and I really fell in love with the adolescent addiction unit at a place called 
Odyssey House. And Odyssey House was actually originally founded back in Boston, 
and then eventually franchised into other locations.  
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 12 
 
 
 
So Odyssey House here is a community addiction treatment center. And I spent about 12 
years working for them at the adolescent unit, and the last three years I was their medical 
director for the whole agency.  
 
 
And what I learned so much about addiction was that addiction does not start as an adult, 
it really starts much earlier: it starts (really) in childhood, and typically the use starts in 
adolescence. 
 
 
So, now I spend quite a bit of my time looking at that overlap between trauma and 
addiction. And the trauma piece becomes very relevant with psychiatry, and all of the 
anxiety that comes along with that, as well as secondary depression, and then also can 
give rise to other psychopathology, like: bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia (if there is an 
underlying genetic proclivity there). 
 
 
So my work is really focused now on looking for what I call the epicenters of what set off 
that addiction. Because I know until we find that epicenter, we’re not going to really treat 
the addiction, we’re going to create more of a revolving door, and we’re going to just be 
in the entrenchment of maintaining sobriety instead of creating resiliency and really 
helping a person into a full recovery program.  
 
[30:15] 
 
LG: 
And can you explain what you mean a little bit about that epicenter? 
 
SW: 
Yeah. So, epicenter – what I mean by that, and that’s Susie Wiet terminology that I’m 
using there – epicenter, for me, is looking for where did the thought process change, that 
gave rise to an addiction. 
 
 
So the addiction doesn’t happen, typically, right at the point of the epicenter. The 
addiction becomes a secondary mechanism, and what I have called now an avoidance of 
self (that’s my definition of any addiction). It’s avoidance of self because there’s 
something that changed that we don’t want to address.  
 
 
So, we’re looking for a way out, we’re looking for, basically, negative reinforcement 
schedule, because we don’t want to feel crappy; so, we look for something else to take 
that crappiness away. And so, that’s what that epicenter is.  
 
 
That epicenter could start all the way back in early childhood, because of maybe really 
poor parenting, or because loss of a sibling, or because of people who have harmed us in 
some way. And when we experience those types of things, then that has been very well-
documented that it alters our neurobiology. And that’s what I’m really fascinated in, are 
the changes in the neurobiology, starting in early childhood.  
 
 
And there is a very, very famous study that was conducted that was called ACES (or 
Adverse Childhood Experiences). And the founders of that study were (or are) Dr. Felitti, 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 13 
 
and also Dr. Anda. And what is astonishing to me is that this study has been replicated on 
numerous levels – the original study was almost on a half a million people, and yet, most 
people don’t even know about the impact of this.  
 
[32:26] 
 
 
And what they clearly have demonstrated is without understanding these (again, what I 
am calling the epicenters) – without resolution of these early childhood experiences, we 
see very, very strong correlations of long-term, not just psychiatric illness, but also long-
term pro-inflammatory states, which give rise to very significant and well-known 
physical health disorders (like cardiovascular disease, auto-immune disorders, and a 
whole slew of other related physical health issues). 
 
 
And so I spend the majority of my time looking for these epicenters, because I know that 
once we’re able to identify that epicenter, we can start helping our clients, our patients to 
start normalizing their neurobiology. And when we normalize our neurobiology, we start 
healing our body from within too.  
 
 
Now that’s not to say that I don’t use medications to assist with that. But I also know that 
just putting a medication on top of it, without looking for these epicenters – we’re not 
doing anything except putting a band-aid over a gaping wound.  
 
LG: 
So, as a psychiatrist you mentioned you see a lot of (obviously) mental health issues, 
including people who are suicidal, people who might be inclined to self-harm, all kinds of 
addiction and trauma. So, you (in your daily work) are a witness to a lot of different kinds 
of suffering. Can you talk about that a little bit? 
 
SW: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
And how that affects you, or how you keep it from affecting you? 
 
SW: 
Um-hmm. Yeah, that’s a really great question. I would say that brings me all the way 
back to, really, my training. And I had to learn how to remain really empathetic without 
bringing everything home.  
 
 
And the work that I do on a daily basis is, in some ways, far more exhausting than the 
grueling hours that I spent on the surgical units. And it’s so draining because the energy 
that’s required to constantly be reading other people, and looking for subtle clues, and at 
the same time being supportive of them when they are typically (or very often) in a state 
of distress.  
 
[35:25] 
 
 
It’s just incredibly challenging work. And I love the work, I absolutely love it. Nothing 
brings me more joy than when something finally clicks for someone – and not necessarily 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 14 
 
when a medication clicks, but when they can see themselves in a very different 
perspective. And then they start – and then their behavior starts changing for the positive.  
 
 
But going back to your question about suffering – it’s nothing short of an honor for me to 
be able to hear some of the most intimate and intricate stories of people’s lives. So very 
often, people will share things with me that they don’t even talk about with their spouses. 
Or, things that they felt like (quote), “I thought I’d take that to the grave with me.” 
 
 
And it’s an honor because it’s not just – it’s not at all about being voyeuristic. It’s about 
then taking that seed of information and helping them to cultivate a full garden for 
themselves out of it. Where they’re needing to (perhaps) overcome the perspective that’s 
kept them sick for so long, and that’s kept them isolated for so long; or that has prevented 
them from reaching out to people for so long. And that just really drives that suffering 
even more. 
 
 
So, working with them on all different levels – in all different levels I mean from 
medication, to behavior, to perception, I’ll integrate spiritual perspective (if they are so-
inclined), nutrition, exercise – all of these things really integrate into a person’s well-
being.  
 
 
And the only organ in our body that governs over everything else in the body is the brain, 
and that’s where the suffering begins and is perceived. And that’s where we have to 
really focus those efforts to bring them to a different understanding about their ability to 
participate in their own well-being. 
 
[38:00] 
 
LG: 
Do you feel you’ve ever suffered because of the kind of work that you do? 
 
SW: 
I definitely have gotten myself really exhausted, for sure. There have been (definitely) 
times when, you know, both in the past and even, that can happen really at any time – if a 
number of patients aren’t doing well, it definitely taxes my time, and I want to be able to 
be there to support my patients, and help them resolve issues as quickly as possible.  
 
 
So, that definitely takes a toll on me, and sometimes on my family too; when I’m unable 
to join for vacations the whole time, or unable to even join for dinner, sometimes, the 
whole time because I have to attend to those more urgent issues.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. How do you not take this stuff home? 
 
SW: 
[Chuckles] 
 
LG: 
Seems like it would be hard. 
 
SW: 
Sometimes it is hard. Sometimes I’ll talk in generalities with my husband, and sometimes 
with my friends, and definitely with my colleagues. But for the most part, I’ve learned 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 15 
 
that I really have to leave it (as best as I can) back in my office. And that doesn’t mean 
that I’m not working every, single night – either catching up on a documentation, or 
following up on something else that I’ve learned: whether it’s learning about a new 
intervention.  
 
[40:00] 
 
 
But yeah, I think I’ve done a really good job of being able to leave it at my office. And 
then coupling that with taking care of myself. So, I have a daily practice of yoga and 
meditation (if I don’t fall asleep during it) [laughs]. And my spirituality is very important 
to me, so I find a lot of balance through that as well. And then definitely, just being with 
my family, being with my friends – that’s so important to counterbalance the heftiness 
that’s experienced sometimes at work. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Well what would you say was one of the best things about being a doctor? 
 
SW: 
Wow. 
 
LG: 
And the work that you do? 
 
SW: 
I have to go back to that experience of when people just – you’re working, working, 
working with them and they finally get it: they see themselves in a different vantage. And 
they are starting to see hope for themselves – there’s nothing, for me, more rewarding 
than that. It just like lights me up in all corners of my entire being, seeing that joy and 
that hope, or that possibility for that. And that’s my pay-off. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. What about one of the hardest, or most challenging things? 
 
SW: 
When I have a really stuck patient, and I can see where they need to go with something – 
and I think it boils down probably to trust: having to build up trust with a patient. And 
trust (in psychiatry) when we really are wanting healing and not just a band-aid, really 
developing that necessary level of trust for helping them change: that’s the hardest thing 
when someone is stuck, because you can see it for them, and you can’t help them along.  
 
[42:23] 
 
 
It’s kind of like having like a two or three-year-old, when you have to convince them 
[laughs] that they have to do something that they don’t want to do. And as parents, we 
can, you know, pull out our bag of tricks; but when we’re dealing with an adult who is so 
stuck, or an adolescent, or even a young kid who is just really stuck and you can see all 
the potential for them, and you can’t help them, and they’re losing hope. That’s painful 
for me. 
 
LG: 
How has (if you can remember back this far) –  
 
SW: 
Um-hmm. 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 16 
 
 
LG: 
How has being a physician, and specifically a psychiatrist, changed you as a person? 
 
SW: 
My training really changed me, definitely for the better. Gosh, there are so many different 
directions I can go there [laughs].  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SW: 
I would say because of not just my training, but all of my work experiences it has really 
broadened my perspective on humanity and what we’re capable of doing: both the good 
and the bad. Nothing really surprises me anymore. I used to be a pretty anxious person, 
and I think I’ve lost a lot of that, so I’m grateful for that. 
 
 
It’s helped me to become way more balanced, but that’s not just being a physician or my 
training, per se, but all of the other pieces, I think, that I have brought to that. And I 
would say one of the most important keys for my training (and how I like to practice 
psychiatry) was doing what’s called demonstration psychotherapy.  
 
[44:33] 
 
 
So, what that means is during my residency training we had an elective to work with a 
skilled therapist as, like a student in training, but we were also the patient. And [laughs] 
my demonstration psychotherapist was also a child psychiatrist. And I loved his name 
(but I won’t mention it) [laughs], but it was very apropos.  
 
 
And when I went into him I said, “You know, I’ve learned x, y, and z about myself, and 
I’ve done all this work on myself already,” (because I’d already seen a therapist when I 
was, actually prior to med school). And he just looked at me and he said, “Huh. So, now 
you’re ready to deal with all the emotional content?” 
 
 
And I about hit the roof. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SW: 
I thought, “How audacious.” And I knew he was spot on.  
 
 
And because of that demonstration psychotherapy, he really helped me to understand 
how to unearth (within myself) pretty intense pain that I didn’t know I was burying, and 
going back to those epicenters that I talked about before – we all have our epicenters; we 
don’t all necessarily end up with addiction. But I feel like all of us have the potential to 
go down those routes, until we understand how to unearth these things within ourselves, 
and be real with who we are.  
 
 
And I would say that’s really what demonstration psychotherapy helped me to do, was to 
really see myself for who I am, and not who other people told me I was, or who I thought 
other people wanted me to be.

LG: 
Um-hmm; interesting.  
 
SW: 
So, I feel like I owe him my life.  
 
LG: 
As a female physician –  
 
SW: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
Do you feel there are any barriers that you had to overcome in your training? 
 
[46:36] 
 
SW: 
You know –  
 
LG: 
Or in medical school, or in residency, or –  
 
SW: 
Yeah. You know, I’ve thought about that question, actually, quite a bit across my career. 
I found a lot of nepotism when I was in med school, and I really couldn’t wait to leave 
that arena.  
 
 
And when I came out for my residency training I felt like for the most part it was 
balanced, but I’m sad to say that even in medicine today, that I still find that there is 
gender discrimination, despite the feminization of medicine. I would say that I 
experienced at least quite a bit of discrimination. And I’m pretty vocal about it, so I 
would bring it up as I needed to. But even despite that, I still felt like it was challenging, 
many times, to have my voice heard.  
 
 
And I think because of those experiences, and because I’m a pretty feisty person [laughs] 
– perhaps that’s why I started my own private practice and have been creating a center of 
wellness where everyone plays fairly in the sand box, and everybody’s voice is 
important. Because I didn’t really, honestly, experience that consistently in other arenas.  
 
 
And specifically what I mean by that is having numerous experiences of being a woman 
in leadership at different institutions and my voice not being heard, but then hearing a 
male counterpart say pretty much the same thing, and he had a brilliant idea. 
 
[48:40] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SW: 
And there is nothing more demoralizing to me than that, and that’s when I really started 
to think about how do I really want to craft the rest of my career, and create what I know 
to be really effective? 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 18 
 
 
So, I have a fantastic team, and we have men and women on my team. And we have a 
great time together. And what’s, I think, so essential is to have a foundation where 
everyone feels like they can be who they are, and there is trust amongst the entire team. 
Because then you get really great advocacy for your patients. 
 
LG: 
Nice.  
 
 
Okay, I just have a couple of questions about humor.  
 
SW: 
[Laughs] 
 
LG: 
What are some jokes told about psychiatrists? 
 
SW: 
About psychiatrists? [Laughs] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
SW: 
You know, I am really bad with jokes. But –  
 
LG: 
Or funny things? If you can think of any. 
 
SW: 
Like on the spot I’m so terrible at these things. But what I can say is like it’s not 
necessarily a joke, but I don’t like to take my degrees and my status so seriously. So, I’ll 
refer to myself as “the shrink.” And I think that that’s really helpful for my clients, 
because they’ll just kind of giggle a little bit. And they see that I’m just another person; 
I’m another person who has a lot of information and a different perspective to offer them. 
But I’m just a human being too. 
 
LG: 
And how do people who you just meet treat you when they learn you’re a psychiatrist? 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
What kinds of things do they say? 
 
SW: 
Almost inevitably, I get the joke, “Are you analyzing me?” [Laughs] And I’ll tell them, 
“No, not right now, but I can.” [Laughs] 
 
[50:47] 
 
LG: 
That’s cute. That’s cute.  
 
 
Well what kinds of advice, or things would you like somebody think about, or know, who 
might be thinking about going to medical school? 
 
SW: 
If someone is going to medical school these days, I would really encourage them to look 
for a medical school that has a progressive curriculum, and that really starts to integrate, 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Susie Wiet 
Page 19 
 
within the context of their curriculum, functional medicine. That has been a wonderful 
add-on and additional training that I have sought out on my own, that looks at the basics 
going all the way back to those very first lectures: looking at the basics of cellular 
biology, and how do we really start influencing those in a very natural context.  
 
 
And that’s very possible. And since I started practicing in that vein, I have very happily 
been able to reduce a lot of medications for folks, and help them get to a place of more 
substantive living, and leading more of a balanced life. So, functional medicine, I think, 
is really important for medical school curriculum. 
 
 
And then just be prepared to really study extremely hard, and to put your all into it. 
Because you are eventually going to be responsible for people’s lives. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
 
Is there anything that we haven’t talked about that you feel is important for people to 
know? 
 
SW: 
Medicine is – it’s such a beautiful discipline. I really love looking at biology as being a 
symphony. And at the same time, it really needs to be honored, I believe, as such. And I 
really wish that there was not such an emphasis on seeing physicians, and for physicians 
to see themselves, as being owed a lot of money.  
 
 
I think it’s important that people are paid appropriately for the work, and definitely all of 
the training, and the excessive hours, and lots and lots of money that goes into medical 
education.  
 
[53:27] 
 
 
But there’s always like this lingering sadness for me when I see medicine either being 
bastardized by the media, and/or seeing people within our own discipline who are not 
really honoring the reason why we became physicians, and honoring the Hippocratic 
Oath of first, do no harm. 
 
 
And there are so many ways that we can do harm, and I’d love for us all to look at our 
humanism [laughs], and why we went into medicine in the first place. 
 
LG: 
Nice. Okay; is there anything else you’d like to add? 
 
SW: 
Nope, I think that’s it. Thank you so much for this opportunity. 
 
LG: 
Okay.  
 
 
Well it is – again, I am Lisa Gabbert; we’ve been talking to Dr. Susie Wiet at her office 
in Salt Lake City. And today is Sunday, December 8th, 2019.
