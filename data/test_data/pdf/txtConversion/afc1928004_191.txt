Dims JENNIE ENGEL'S pleasing ballad singing is also be 
coming an attractive feature at this establishment, and the 
lady is invariably welcomed with applause.—N. V. Her-
ald. 
Miss JENNIE ENGEL'S ballad singing, for example, might 
serve as an excellent model to the young lady artists of 
the drawing-room who cannot be persuaded to pronounce 
the words of their songs, and her sprightliness of manner 
would not be out of place in many a 
sombre concert room 
—Boston Herald. 
Miss JENNIE ENGEL is one of the most exquisite singers 
we have ever heard. 
Her tones are as soft and mellow 
as a 
silver flute. 
She sings the melodies of the immortal 
poet, Tom Moore, with great feeling and pathos, added to 
which she possesses a 
charming person, and in appearance 
is one of the most beautiful women we have ever seen.— 
Baltimore Star. 
Miss JENNIE ENGEL as Octavia, the female bandit, being 
especially 
worthy of mention, and altogether proved 
quite a 
success.- —N. 
Y. 
Herald. 
MISS JENNIE ENGEL, one of the most charming serio 
comic vocalists in the profession, clad in a 
rich and taste-
ful costume, sang several songs which were loudly ap-
plauded. 
1. Clipper. 
MISS JENNIE ENGEL is a 
public favorite. 
She deserves 
to be. 
As a 
soprano, Jennie stands high in the rank of 
female singers. 
Her voice is sweet and melodious, and 
4 
her presence delightful. 
She displays excellent taste in 
her costumes, but the dress is entirely lost sight of when 
her voice is heard—how pathetic , how mournful and 
wailing, and then she bursts into a 
rollicking, cheerful 
ditty, which almost makes u 
i 
forget even the name of 
sorrow. 
Her attitude on the stage is both graceful and 
womanly. 
She is entirely free from the affectation so 
common amongst female singers, and we are confident 
that her present popularity will increase with every night's 
appearance.—Doston Gazette. 
JENNIE ENGEL still remains a 
popular feature of this 
most popular company. 
Her songs are perfect little 
gems in their way, and she has a 
most charming stage 
presence, which adds much to the effect produced by her 
beautiful voice. 
That she may linger with us for many 
weeks to amuse, is the earnest wish of every patron of 
the Howard.—Boston Post. 
THERE'S BOUND TO BE A 
ROW. 
I'M a 
poor unlucky married man, 
I've got an awful wife, 
To please her I 
do all I 
can, 
But still she plagues my life, 
If I 
do everything that's right, 
She'll find a 
fault some how. 
And if not in at eight each nigh 
There's bound to he a 
row. 
CHORUS. 
There's bound to be a 
row, 
Bound to be a 
row, 
Do all in life to please my wife, 
Yet there's bound to be a 
row. 
She makes me do the household work 
When I 
come home at night, 
If I 
cough or sneeze when going to bed, 
Of course that is not right. 
If she should wake the young ones up, 
With rage she'll storm I 
vow, 
And if I 
snore too hard for her, 
Why there's bound to be a 
row, 
There's bound, &c. , 
She wakes me early ev'ry morn, 
In an awful cruel way, 
She kicks me round about the room, 
Yet not a 
sentence dare I 
say, 
I 
have to wash my stockings, 
My pants awl shirts T 
vow, 
And if I 
don't wash for her as well, 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
There's bound, Stc. 
And when I'm paid my wages, 
After working hard all week, 
I 
give her ev'ry farthing up, 
And then she's got the cheek, 
To give me two pence for myself, 
And for that I 
have to bow, 
But if I 
spend it all at once, 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
There's bound, ke.

THOUGH you gentlemen are stilling, 
It's very plain to me, 
But most of you are single, 
Which of course ought not to be, 
There's girls I'm sure in plenty, 
Who would your happiness advance, 
By wedding you to morrow 
If they only had a 
chance.

filen don't be shy, for single life's a 
sin, 
Fair lady, as the proverb says, 
Faint heart did never win. 
Then don't be shy, but do the best you can, 
And when you go a 
courting 
Why, speak out like a 
man. 
When at your kind attentions, 
We appear to take offense' 
Pray don't be disconcerted 
That's merely a 
pretence. 
if to wring your, ears we threaten, 
We, of course, wan no such thing, 
It's merely a 
suggestion, 
We ourselves should like a 
ring. 
Then don't be shy, Sce. 
Now you gentlemen attention. 
If you'd happy be for life, 
Don't live in single wretchedness, 
But quickly take a 
wife. 
There's a 
funny man sitting there, 
Like one upon the shelf, 
To set you an example. 
I'll make love to him myself. 
Then don't be thy, ice.

Her smile was bright and gay, 
And loving was her glance! 
We wandered in the ' mall;" 
We 
strolled beside the " lake ;" 
Her pretty hand so white and small 
Of course, I 
chanced to take ! 
We talked about the swans 
And all the other birds, 
I 
thought I 
heard sweet music 
When I 
listened to her words! 
She leaned upon my arm ; 
The sun went down the west, 
I 
tried in vain to whisper all 
The love within my breast!

KATE O'BRIEN. 
OH! Kate O'Brien is my name, 
I'll tell you boys from whence I 
came, 
Old Ireland is the place I 
claim, 
And I'm an Irish girl. 
No Country is more dear to me, 
Than the little isle stands in the sea. 
Where boys and girls are gay and free, 
Deny it if you can. 
Sure old Ireland's the place, 
That there's fame for fun and mirth, 
Its equals you cannot find, 
And search all o'er the earth. 
Good-natured boys and girls there, 
With few of them you can compare, 
Their hearts and minds are free from care, 
That makes an Irish- man. 
CHORUS. 
Then Kate O'Brien is my name 
I'll tell you boys, from whence I 
cams. 
Old Ireland is the place I 
claim, 
And I'm an Irish girl. 
Oh Dan O'Connel, Ireland's friend, 
He struggled hard her to defend 
'Gainst all invaders who did intend 
To crush poor Paddy's land, 
He alwaya proved poor Paddy's friend 
13 
When on his trial he did attend, 
And made the noblest back to bend, 
To the honest Irishman. 
In the high court of justice, 
He made them all to stare, 
With his learning, wit, and humor, 
To hear him it was rare. 
May peace and plenty ever be, 
In our little isle stands in the sea, 
Then let the toast be Ireland free, 
And you'll all be happy men. 
Then Kate O'Brien, &-,
c. 
In Eighteen forty-eight gone by 
The Irishmen they had to fly, 
For famine stood in every eye 
Along old Grannia's shore; 
Thousands to America did sail 
Leaving their wives and babes to wail, 
They were determined they would not fail, 
But their hardships undergo. 
The Harp that once through Tara's Halls, 
Its cord shall strike again, 
And welcome back the exile 
From across the stormy main. 
May peace and plenty ever be, 
In that little isle stands in the sea, 
Then let the toast be Ireland free, 
And you'll all be happy men.

What Would the Men do Without Us. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGL. 
I'M going to sing you a 
song, 
Not very short or very long, 
And as to weather right or wrong, 
I'll tell you when I've done sir. 
It is about the sterner sex 
Who us girls of ten will perplex, 
And tease defy, deceive and vex, 
And think it very jolly, 
CHORUS. 
Oh you know its true, 
You can't deny what I 
tell you. 
For doat on us, of course you do! 
You could not do without us. 
When little girls, you often please, 
To take and dance us on your knees 
We pull your whiskers and we tease 
You near to desperation; 
But when we have much bigger grown, 
Just like the tender rose full blown, 
Oh ! don't you wish we were your own 
You lords of the creation. 
Oh! you, &c. 
And when we were wed, what jolly fun, 
We then take care of number one, 
Sharp as you are, you're often done, 
You can't deny it. I 
know. 
We do with you just as we 
And sometimes treat you very ill, 
But with all our faults you love us still, 
And will for evermore, sir.

MY NATIVE LAND OF GREEN. 
I 
AM a 
true born Irishman I 
come from Paddy's land, 
Where the stranger finds a 
welcome with the grasp of friendship's 
hand, 
Where the wit it flows spontaneously, and pleasure does abound, 
And good nature mix'd together in abundance can be found, 
Where the boys are all so jolly, at a 
pattren race or fair; 
For courting purty girls none with them can compare, 
They're the bravest set of boys, that ever yet were seen, 
The boys of dear OuId Ireland, my native land so green. 
You will surely find that Paddy, his aid will always lend; 
And he ready to assist you, if e'er you want a 
friend. 
If his cabin you should enter, you know as well as me; 
He'll treat you with the very best, quite welcome you will be. 
He'll share his pipe and whiskey, your spirits he will cheer; 
Oh 1 
ould Ireland you're my darling, the spot I 
love so aear, 
For true hospitality, no matter where I've been; 
There's no place like ould Ireland, my native land so green. 
If e'er you're bent on pleasure, abroad you need not roam, 
There's no such sights in foreign lands, like those we have at home, 
Killarney's lakes are beautiful, as every one must own, 
And if your fond of nonsense, just kiss the Blarney Stone, 
We have scenery in Wicklow, there's the Giant's Causeway too • 
The bay and sights round Dublin, are splendid to the view, 
I 
have traveled many a 
thousand mile strange countries I 
have 
seen; 
But none to equal Erin's Isle, my native land so green. 
Then here's success to Erin, my own dear native Isle. 
May discontent soon vanish, and plenty on ier smile. 
May discord and ill meting, be banished irom thy shore; 
And prosperity 
on thee, as it did in days of yore, 
I 
only w1:-.n 
for happiness, that our troubles soon will cease 
So we might Jive like brothers, hi unity and peace. 
May trade increase and flourish, and shortly will be seen; 
The people gay and happy) in my native land so green.

Barney, the Tight Lad of Derry, 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
OH! Barney, sweet Barney, was blithesome and merry; 
We met, where the wild thistle grew: 
His cheek and his lips were as red, as a 
cherry, 
His eye, like his jacket, was blue: 
And lie vow'd, that I 
look'd like an angel above, 
And his tongue coax'd so swately, I 
tumbled in love, 
Wid Barney, the tight lad of Derry, 
Oh! Barney, the tight lad of Derry! 
But 0! the desaver, he set my heart bating, 
Then whisper'd, " Dear Bridget, good bye! 
'Deed ! the times are so bad, that abroad I'm retreating, 
My fortune, far off, for to try:" 
And he kiss'd me, and told me to banish my fears, 
I 
spoke not, but moisten'd the cheek, wid my tears, 
Of Barney, the tight lad of Derry. 
Ohl Barney, the tight lad of Derry I 
Long years have pass'd by, since I 
parted with Barney, 
And sadly I 
watch Wry day; 
And lovers, come coorting,, so brimful of blarney, 
But my love is wid him, far away: 
And should he come back with his heart left behind, 
He shan't see me weep, for I 
still will be kind, 
To Barney, the tight lad of Derry. 
Ohl Barney, the tight lad of Derry!

FLIRTING IN THE TWILIC-HT. 
Words by M ISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
Music by DAVID BRAII AM. 
OH! I'm very fond of roving 
When the stars are in the sky ; 
And a 
heart so true and loving 
Often meets me on the sly. 
The sweetest words he whispers, 
And his eyes are sparkling blue ; 
But what he tells, you may be sure, 
I'll never tell to you. 
Oh ! we wait ler while the shadows fall, 
But a 
pair of eyes are my light; 
Of all the joys it beats them all, 
This flirting in the twilight. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! my heart kept going pit-i-pat, 
I 
scarce could tell what I, was at; 
We wandered in the shadows, 
But his beaming eyes they were my light. 
Of joys we meet, there's none so sweet 
As flirting in the twilight. 
(Symphony, when. dance is omitted.) 
Now he called me " pet " and " dearest." 
And I 
could not tell you half! 
And he said I 
was the " nearest " 
Then I 
laughed a 
little laugh! 
His arm he kindly offered, 
Then he offered me his hand, 
And said, he'd make his darling one 
The happiest in the land! 
Tho' twas darkness in the pleasant air, 
Yet his beaming eyes were my light! 
He kissed me—ere I 
was aware— 
While flirting in the twilight! 
Oh my heart, &c. 
Now I 
never can forget him, 
Nor his dear, enticing way! 
Near the place where I 
have met him 
0, I 
wander every day ! 
My heart is in his keeping, 
lie has stolen that I 
know, 
lie really makes a 
very sweet 
And fascinating beau! 
So we wander in the darkness yet, 
But his charming eyes are my light! 
My heart was caught in Cupid's net 
While flirting in the twilight! 
Oh my heart, &e.

Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire, 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
PITY my sorrow and melt at my woes, 
What I've put up with you wouldn't suppose, 
How I've been treated and snubb'd all along, 
Listen to me and I'll tell in my song; 
When but a 
schoolboy tho' trying my best, 
in the last form I 
continued to rest, 
Getting well flogg'd when I 
tried to rise higher, 
'Twas out of the frying pan into the fire. 
CHORUS. 
Out of the Frying Pan, out of the Frying Pan, 
Frrhaps you may fall, if too high you aspire, 
Out of the Frying Pan, out of the Frying Pan, 
Out of the Frying Pan into the fire. 
When tired of leading a 
batchelor's life, 
Looking around me I 
sought for a 
wife, 
Met with an angel with manners so soft, 
Face like a 
Cherub's that sits up aloft, 
Oh! how I 
pictur'd cur lives free from care, 
Happy as dicky birds up in the air, 
But such a 
temper had darling Maria, 
'Twas out of the Frying Pan into the lire. 
Out of the Frying Pan, &C. 
Doting on children, to babies endeaed.

Sung by JENNIE ENGL. 
MOTHER, Home and Heaven! 
How dear those words to me ! 
The first, she held me to her breast, 
And danced me on her knee ; 
I 
was to her a 
priceless gem, 
She thought me nice and fair; 
And now I 
never can forget, 
A faithful mother's care. 
Cnonns 
Mother, Home and Heaven! 
How dear to think of all ! 
Before the trumpeter descends 
To bid us mind his call, 
Mother, Home and Heaven! 
How sweet to me is home ! 
For there we meet with those we love, 
And do not care to roam ; 
We 
have a 
pretty sister's voice, 
To cheer us day by day; 
We 
have a 
little baby bright, 
To watch while he's at play. 
Mother, home, &c, 
Mother, Home and Heaven 
The last we hope to see! 
Where angels gather 'round the throne, 
And sing a

Oh may we all assemble there, 
And cast our sin saside : 
For with the true and righteous ones, 
Our aim is to abide. 
Mother, home, &c. 
NOBODY'S TREASURE, 
Sung by JENNIE ENGL. 
THE snow has been falling and lies white in the street, 
And thro' it are wandering those little bare feet, 
With an old torn dress that tries to enfold 
Her shivering form from the merciless Cold, 
She holds out her hand now chill'd with the blast, 
hoping to find a 
kind word at last; 
But all pass her by, for they all have a 
home, 
Leaving nobody's treasure to wander alone. 
CHORUS. 
Nobody's treasure, nobody's treasure, 
No one will miss her, or speak words of love. 
Nobody's treasure, no one will miss her. or speak words of love. 
Nobody's treasure, Angels bear nobody's treasure above, 
Angels bear nobody's treasure above. 
The storm has been fierce and deserted the street, 
The snow-flakes still fall and are mingled with sleet, 
She sits on a 
doorstep and bitterly cries, 
But warmth is within and no one replies, 
She whispers a 
pray'r she learned on the knee 
Of one who's dead and from sorrow free; 
She's no one to miss her, and no words of love, 
So the angels bear nobody's treasure above. 
Nobody's treasure,

HIS NAME WASN'T LARGE ON THE BILLS. 
Written by Wm. B. CAVANAGH. Sung by BILLY CARTER. 
BILL COTTON, a 
vocalist, young and ambitious, 
Whose muse was decidedly good and propitious, 
He sigh'd for high honors and tuned his banjo, 
And nightly drew plaudits from the gods at the show, 
The fair sex admired him, he made conquests a 
score, 
The artists too laughed at his puns o'er and o'er, 
But sad his misfortune and bitterest of pills, 
His name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
CHORUS. 
The ballet girls adored him and stood in the wings, 
While he tuned his banjo and said funny things, 
But sad his misfetlune and bitterest of pills, 
His name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
His fame kept increasing throughout all the land, 
And scores of new friends he shook by the hand, 
The dailies, too, praised him in articles long, 
For his manipulations of banjo and song, 
Then resolving to be in the profession a 
beau, 
He called on a 
tailor for a 
suit comme ii faut, 
But the snip would not trust or measure his limbs, 
For his name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
The ballet girls, kirc. 
A 
bewitching brunette did his senses entrance, 
His heart was a 
slave to her enraptured glance, 
He proposed, was refused, so to end all his woe, 
Packed his things up at night bade adieu to the show, 
And now o'er the sea in far distant clinics, 
He wanders on foot, plays his banjo and rhymes, 
For his country or home his heart never thrills, 
For his name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
The ballet girls, Ate.

UP ON FORT GREENE. 
AIR—Daton the Bowery. 
I'VE come to sing a 
song to you 
About this noble town, 
And all about the doings 
That has gained some renown; 
Go where you may, do what you will, 
You're never to he seen, 
Without you take a 
girl with you, 
And go up on Fort Greene, 
CuOttus. 
Up on Fort Greene, up on Fort Greene, 
With elegant swells, and the fairest of belles; 
Up on Fort Greene, U 
p 
on Fort Greene, 
There's where I 
do stroll when in town. 
You talk about the avenue, 
Where bloods are often seen; 
But if you want to see some style, 
Why go up on Fort Greene. 
For there you'll see such nobby airs

My Little One Waiting for Me, 
IN the dell where the brooklets gently flowing, 
On the bench 'neath the old willow tree, 
Where the birds their songs are sweetly singing, 
There my little one's waiting for me; 
And she knows well the sound of my footsteps, 
As I 
cross o'er the bridge by the lea, 
And I 
hasten with arms stretch'd to greet her, 
My little one waiting for me. 
And at night when daily toil is over, 
And I'm wending my way toward my home, 
My heart's always beating with pleasure, 
For my little one surely will come; 
As I 
pass o'er that clear rippling brooklet, 
There, watching, I 
always can see , 
On the bench 'neath the old weeping willow, 
My little one waiting for me.

So now my:boys be gay and free, 
And take a 
look at me, 
And see if I 
ain't full of fun, 
And always full of glee. 
So if you want a 
good day's sport, 
Be dressed and look quiet clean, 
For there you'll meet some nice young girls, 
A 
walking on Fort Greene. 
Tip on Fort Greene, &C. 
So now my friends I've sung my song 
I 
hoped it pleased you all, 
So come and see the boys and girls, 
They are always taking strolls, 
So if there's any strangers here, 
They will not think me mean, 
Beause I've sung a 
song about 
Our beautiful Fort Greene.

THE PRIDE OF PETTICOAT LANE; 
or, Darliug Mary Jane. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
OF all the trials that mortals have I 
think that Love's the 
worst, 
In every sad disaster you're sure to find him first, 
My reason now for saying this, I 
quickly will explain, 
how I've been served by courting one the Pride of Petticoat 
Lane. 
CHORUS. 
er 
Then oh ! what would I 
give, 
Could I 
only but obtain 
A 
sight of my darling Mary Jane; 
The Pride of Petticoat Lane. 
not going to say that she's a 
queen because I 
know she 
aint, 
Nor yet a 
perfect beauty, an angel nor a 
saint, 
Her business it's not over grand you can hear her might and 
main, 
'On Sunday mornings crying out, " hot stew'd eels," down 
the Lane. 
Then oh, &c. 
Her mother used to carry out a 
baked potato can, 
Her father was that celebrated Turkey Rhubarb man, 
30 
Her sisters made handkerchiefs in a 
crowd, her brothers 
did the same, 
So amongst them all they did a 
tidy business down the 
Lane. 
Then oh what, &c., 
used to go on Sunday and sit behind her stall, 
No .,00ner there than a 
crowd of dirty brats would loudly 
bawl, 
"Oh ! here's some swell that's out of luck, we'll watch his 
little game, 
Then with cabbage stumps, and orange peel, they'd pelt me 
down the Lane. 
Then oh, what, Lte. 
One day as I 
sat by her side, she said, "oh Georgey, dear 
Do serve out some eels for me I 
feel so very queer"; 
For I 
want to run to mother, I 
will soon return again," 
So I 
had the job to cry and sell hot stew'd eels down the 
Lane. 
Then oh, what, &c. 
When she returned she brought with her, a 
ferocious-look. 
in 
man, 
Who empties over me all the hot eels in the can; 
Which burnt my 
face, and spoilt my 
clothes, but I 
wouldn't

LOOK AT THE CLOCK. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
YOUNG ladies tarry, think e'er you marry, 
A 
lesson pray take from that I 
sing, 
For though black slaves are of course unknown here, 
We wives you'll find are the slaves of the ring, 
Our husbands nightly, most unpolitely 
With their companions abroad will roam, 
Of us ne'er thinking, they go off drinking, 
While we are crying our eyes out at home. 
CHORUS. 
Think, think, how slowly the moments pass, 
While you're enjoying your pipe and gLss, 
Think, think how slowly the moments pass, 
Now gentlemen pray mind what I 
say, 
And look, look at the clock. 
Now thus to leave us, and so deceive us, 
I'm sure you'll own is a 
monstrous sin, 
For there's no knowing where you are going, 
Or what bad company you may get in, 
For when you tell, deceitful fellows, 
That at your club you have passed the night, 
At that casino you're often seen oh, 
You must acknowledge now that is not right, 
Think, think, & c. 
Then when returning we're soon discerning, 
That in your manner there's something queer, 
You whisper Salmon but that's all gammon, 
It's something stronger than that I 
fear, 
it must be really, for when awaking, 
A 
noise you're making for a 
cup of tea, 
You didn't ought to want Soda water, 
Through eating Salmon you must agree, 
Think, think, IC. 
IIAD I 
been a 
monk or a 
hermit that dwelt 
In a 
cave where the world could not see, 
I 
then might be quiet, collected and cool, 
But fate has not will'd it to be; 
I'm thrown on the world with its troubles and trials, 
To avoid them I 
every day try, 
I'm nervous, fidgety, very reserved, 
In fact, I'm most awfully shy, 
I 
can't look a 
girl in the face, but I 
blush, 
For I 
feel most awfully shy. 
CHORUS. 
Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
Oh! I'm so shy—dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
I 
can't pass a 
stay shop, because I'm so shy. 
Some people go to the theatre each night, 
To see actresses dress'd comme ilfaut, 
But I 
never will cast my eyes on the stage 
-Unless the footlights they put low; 
There's the ballet girls too, so graceful to view. 
To see them is stretcli'd ev'ry eye; 
To some this is good, but ' tis not to me, 
For I 
feel most awfully shy, 
Ballet girls' movements are all very well, 
But I 
feel most wretchedly shy. 
CHORUS. 
Shy, shy. shy, shy! 
! 
I'm so shy—dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy: 
would if I 
could, but I 
can't; I'm so shy. 
For all I'm so shy, I 
once fell in love, 
To my sweetheart no question could pop, 
For hours I 
would sit by my loved one and say— 
"Vol hing ! and then I 
would stop; 
She put the question, I, blushing, said 
Got married—I 
felt I 
should die, 
To think of the fru tire, teats came to my eyes, 
I 
felt so terribly shy, 
Yes, to think of the future, tears came to my eyes, 
or I 
felt so uncommonly shy. 
CHORUS. 
Shy, shy, shy, shy: 
Oh ! I'm so shy—dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy. shy, shy: 
When I 
put on the ring I 
was awfullyshy 
UPON THE GRAND PARADE, 
LET people talk of foreign life 
Its pleasures and its joys, 
But continental gaiety 
To me's all empty noise. 
And raffling, dashing Broadway, too, 
Is quite thrown in the shade, 
By Long Branch in the season there, 
Upon the Grand Parade.

Throws our Broadway in the shade.

While on that Graial Parade.

And lots or tunny taig.• 
And .tuen pretty little speeches, too; 
Yet I

There are , oine nang:ity libs all told,

That's the place to pick and choose, 
There's Dutchman, Frenchmen, Germans, Turks

And flue old American gentlemen 
Who have their fortunes made, 
And gay young swells with none at all, 
Upon that Grand Parade. 
Upon the Grand Parade, (Sze,

Why I 
hope that it will be, 
To some nice, jolly captain,

DOLLY DOT.. 
As sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
I'M told that once there lived a 
maid, 
Whose name was Dolly Dot, 
And while her Pa soled hoots and shoes, 
She sold potatoes hot; 
He never stirred from out his stall, 
But Dolly had to roam. 
For she repaired to Madison Square 
While he repaired at home. 
Cu 
on is. 
Dolly Dot was handsome, Dolly Dot was fair, 
Dolly Dot potatoes hot sold in Madison Square; 
Oh! Dol:y Dot was charming, Dolly Dot was gay 
And just the sort of a 
girl to steal a 
fellow's heart away 
Now as she earned her daily bread 
'Tis said that it betel, 
She won the heart of one who came 
His daily bread to sell; 
So gay was he that in his coat 
A 
flour was always found, 
And he went round the Square because 
The Square was in his round. 
Doily Dot.

ONE April morn, when walking down, 
A 
quiet country lane, 
I 
overtook a 
fair young girl. 
Whilst hurrying through the rain. 
I 
asked her " If she would accept 
My arm and take a 
share 
Of my umbrella ?" " Thanks, kind Sir, 
I 
will," replied the fair. 
SPOKEN.—One with golden locks, by Jove, and without c,ie 
of those useful articles (holding up Umbrella)— when she 
popped her little arm in mine, my heart beat to that degree it 
nearly dislocated my 
ribs (of the Umbrella I 
mean) it's a 
fact: I 
thought to myself, here's a 
chance to go—

Courting in the rain, courting in the rain, 
I 
ne'er regret the day I 
met my charmer in the lane: 
Courting in the rain, courting in the rain, 
'Twas sweeter far than moon or star, 
Whilst coueing Mary Jane. 
The rain poured down alarmingly, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it: 
There I 
quickly learnt her name. 
She also told me where she lived, 
With Pa down at the farm, 
A 
farmer's daughter: well, said I, 
That is an extra charm.

what could be better ? I 
wished the rain would keep on as `
a 
rather liked— 
Courting in the rain, &a 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright. 
The little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light— 
I 
gently pressed her arm in mine, 
And said: " Now don't say nay, 
But let me come and meet you here 
Again, some other day." 
SPOKEN. —" Well, she said, I 
can't exactly decide, you must

So I 
made up my mind to go in and inform till 
old gentleman we'd been 
Courting in the rain, & c. 
We reached the old farm-house, arid then 
She introduced to me 
Her Pa, a 
jolly nice old )oy, 
With him I 
made quite free: 
I 
told him where and when I'd met, 
his daughter in the rain, 
And bleed the lucky chance that took 
Me down that country lane—

Am.—" Getting up Stairs." 
TALE: about modest girls, I 
knew a 
young chap, 
Too modest to kiss a 
girl sitting on his lap, 
Tho' he was twenty-five, he no girl did adore; 
In fact didn't know, what the girls were made for! 
Cuonus. 
Such a 
very modest young man was Samivell Simmons 
Such a 
modest milksop no one ever saw. 
So modest was this nice innocent youth, 
That he couldn't bear to look at the naked truth; 
Ile went to the great Exhibition, one day. 
And, at sight of the " Greek Slave," he fainted away. 
Such a 
modest, & c. 
fled blush to the eyes and looked round askance 
If a 
pretty 
cast upon him a 
sly glance ; 
The ladies 'all said, he would never get wed, 
He could sooner court danger, than any fair maid. 
Such a

To say the right word, his mind up he couldn't make, 
So as4ed for a 
pound of bull's latter-end steak ! 
Such a 
limiest, &-c. 
When down by the sea side he was such a 
flat, 
The bosom of the ocean he couldn't look at; 
lie would have been a 
soldier and fought Greeks or Turks, 
But he was afraid of looking at uncovered br_ast-works. 
Such a

Such a

Now, Samivell's mamma had money, and said 
She'd not leave him a

He blush'd, but the thought of losing the tin,

Such a

Soon found one, got wed and his friends have since sworn. 
Ere the honeymoon was done all his modesty was gone!

SHE WORE A 
MONKEY JACKET. 
As sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
THOUGH its evident a 
landsman's life's the life for me, 
For in managing a 
yacht, I 
am very much at sea; 
Yet I 
once went out a 
cruising, and I 
think that you'll agree, 
I 
was very badly treated, as you soon shall see. 
I 
was staying at Cowes, and I 
walked on the pier, 
When I 
met a 
pretty girl, such a 
nice little dear, 
And fell right over head and ears in love with her, I 
fear: 
'Twas the saLwy little yachting dress that settled me. 
CriontrS. 
For she wore a 
monkey jacket and a 
neat straw hat, 
A 
pretty little ribbon and a 
sweet cravat, 
For she wore a 
monkey jacket and a 
neat straw hat, 
And was so fond of yachting. 
Very soon an introduction to this pretty girl I 
got, 
Her father was the owner of a 
smart little yacht; 
And on a 
summer's morning, when the sun was very hot, 
He asked me if I 
should like to take a 
trip to sea. 
I 
very soon consented, for I 
thought I 
saw 
A famous opportunity, I 
hadn't had before, 
Of proposing for her band, for I 
loved her more and more 
For the saucy little yachting dress had settled me. 
For she I'ore, & co. 
w•wilailliY •

Then I 
soon rigged myself out in a 
nautical dress, 
For when you go out yachtin ,, you cannot do less; 
Though I 
felt rather awkward in the clothes. I 
must confess; 
Like a 
swan upon a 
turnpike road, you see, 
The water was romrh, and I 
didn't feel grand, 
'gut it wouldn't do to own it, you must understand, 
And on my knees I ()tiered for her heart and for her hand, 
For the saucy little yachting dress had settled me. 
For she wore, & c, 
Thought I 
felt so very wretched, I 
could hardly speak, 
And knew that my appeal was most excessively weak. 
saw it pretty smile upon her (11'11*(111We cheek, 
And thought myself accepted on the briny sea; 
But in trying to fret up, for I 
felt assured, 
My head it went to windward, and my legs went leeward; 
I 
tried to say, " 7rly dearest one!" but only called out " Stpw-

Oh, that saucy little yachting dress had settled me! 
For she wore, (te. 
The sailors quickly picked me up, and carried me below, 
For the rest of the trip I 
was too unwell to show; 
But when I 
got on shore again, I 
determined I 
would go, 
And conclude the declaration I'd commenced at sea. 
I 
ran down to the pier the next day in great haste. 
And there she was but agony. alas, for her taste!

Of the saucy littie ,yachting dres..q that settled me.

parting kiss, 
I 
always used to say: 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
Mother says I

Oh, George, dear George, 
Not Just yet awhile.

And sank upon his knees in quite

Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we be wed; 
He longed to hear me give reply, 
And this is what I 
said: 
Mother says I 
musn't, &c. 
From then he went to work, indeed, 
He left no stone unturned; 
Until two thousand dollars a 
year, 
At last he'd really earned. 
My mother heard how things had changed, 
And when we met one day, 
I 
seemed so pleased aml so at last 
I 
lovingly did say: 
SPoKEN.—Well, George, darling, as you have improved In 
circumstances since we last met, suppose you ask me again

The swells of th ocean to carry me

But, when I

And have dress'd and emerged on the pelibly strand, 
Oh! what a

What a

You may grasp by the hand, boys, 
But keep yor hearts free. 
From the swells on the shoi 
By the side of the sea. 
There's a

bride. 
For he knows, cunning dog, why the girls are brou:,lit dow

The mammas are more verdant then they were in town. 
He ogles an heiress; ma' sanctions the match, 
And all in a

But silly mamma, finds, too late, that her " catch "

Oh! silly rmnimas, 
Let you (lerighters go free

MASTER TOMMY WHATTLE 
And the B:g Blue Bottle, 
As sung by Miss ,TEN. I ENGEL. 
ABOUT a 
year, or two, or three, or four, or five ago, 
There . ived a 
wealthy family, residing down at Bow 
They- kept a 
footman and a 
cook. a 
page and many others, 
They'd fourteen aunts, six uncles, seven sisters and eight bro-
thers. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Master Whattle, naughty Master Whattle, 
Why did you to and kill that big blue-bottle ? 
They all were handsome children, but his mother's hope and joy, 
Was Tommy Whattle, aged five, a 
darling ilttle boy; 
He'd learnt to read, and write, and sing his do, re, ml, sol, fa, 
:k.tid though he always cross'il his 
t's" he never cross'd his ma. 
OhI Master. & c. 
he'd take his powders minus jam, and went to bed at night 
And never seeni'd at all put out when nurse put out the light; 
But children have their weaknesses, however much you chide 
'eat, 
And Tommys was for killing flies, he never could abide 'em. 
! 
Master, 
The dragon and the blue- tail , ly vere his especial horror,

Whattle, 
Until one day he chanced to slay a 
rno:1 
routs bi 
blue-bottle. 
Oh! Master, &c. 
The blue-bottle's the King of the flies, as al: of you may guess. 
A crowning triumph, Tommy thought, this was to his success, 
For not a 
single fly appeared again. I've heard it said, 
Until that dreadful night, when little Tommy

gone to sleep rejoicing, too, that wicked 
tie pickle, 
But something settled on his nose, and woke him with its ticklc ; 
A 
horrid buzzing noise he heard-- the flies had conic n 
hosts, 
At least they couldn't conic themselves, and so they sent their 
ghosts. 
Oh! Master, ttc. 
Some had no legs, arid some no heads, no bodie3 and no 
And Tom repented very much he'd done such wicked things: 
They fell upon him, headed by the monstrous big blue- but: 
And flew away with him—and there's an end to Tommy Whattle. 
Oh! Master, & c. 
MORAL. 
Now little children, aged four, or five, or six, or eight, 
Don't kill the flies, or you may meet with Tommy Whattle's fate. 
The world is big enough for all, to live in awl to thrive, 
Then buy a

And though he killed one ev'i j-

ON BOARD OF THE KANGAROO. 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
ONCE I 
was a 
watennan. and liv'd at home in ease; 
Now I

I 
thought I'd like seafaring life, so bid my love " adoo," 
And shipp'd as cook and steward, boys, on board o' the Kan-

CHORUS. 
I 
never thought she would be false, or ever prove untrue, 
When we saIrd away from Milford Bay on board o' the Kan-
garoo. 
My love she was no foolish girl, her age it was two score; 
'My love she was not a " spinster," she'd been married twice 
before; 
And they could not say it was her wealth that stole my heart 
away, 
She was starcher at a 
laundress's for eighteen- pence a 
day.

THE TWINS. 
Sung.by Miss JENNIE ENCEL. 
IN form and features, face and limb 
I 
grew so like niv brother. 
That folks got taking ! tie for him, 
And each tor ma! another; 
it puzzled all our ki ii 
ind kin 
And reached a 
frightful pitch, 
For one of us was born a 
twin. 
But not a 
sold knew .4
, 
ilia. 
One day, to make the matter worse, 
Before our nzlille:,-; 
V.';'re fixed, 
As we were beilig w.tsied by nurse 
We got completely mixed; 
And so you see by fate's decree, 
Or rather nurse's \\Milli, 
My brother John got christened me 
And I 
got 
him. 
MIS fatal likeliss even docre-nd 
My footsteps when at shool— 
And I 
was alwz.is being flogged, 
For John turned out a 
fool ! 
I 
put this question fruitlessly, 
To every one 1 
knew, 
What would you do if you were me 
To prove that you were you 
This sad resiblimve turned the tide 
Of my domestic life. 
And somehow my imended bride 
Became my brother's wife; 
In fact, ycr itfer year this same 
Absurd mistake wen' on, 
And when I 
died, the neighbors came 
And buried—brother John. 
THE PIC-NIO PARTY, 
OF 
all the pleasures on this earth, 
For fun, and frolic joy, and mirth, 
Laughing, riding, walking, talking, 
Give me a 
pic-nic party. 
Girls so pretty, men so witty, 
Rushing from the crowded city. 
List, I 
pray, to this my ditty, 
About the pic-nic party. 
Bo lets be merry and contrive 
how to keep the game alive, 
On fun and frolic let us thrive, 
At this our pie-rue party. 
Now there's the dinner on the graa9. 
The spread, the knives, and forks, and giass, 
With pigeon pies and joints en masse, 
To feed the pic-nic party. 
Tis true they leave the salt behind, 
The corkscrew they can never find, 
But to complain 'Mould be unkind, 
So everybody says " Never mind," 
Now all are seated, they begin, 
When shrieks are heard, a 
horrid din, 
For a 
nest of ants they're sitting in. 
Oh, the joys of a 
pic-nic party. 
54 
When other sports have all been tried, 
A 
lady seated by your side, 
Says " She should like to a 
donkey ride," 
It's so nice at a 
pie-me party. 
When all mounted off you go, 
But Miss Jemima screams out " Oh, 
My donkey's laying down, please wo." 
on, the joys of a 
picnic party. 
You use stick, throw stones and other missiles, 
The driver sets up shrieks and whistles, 
When donkey lays down in a 
lot of thistles, 
That's nice at a 
pic-nic party. 
You perhaps suggest a 
little walk 
With a 
charming girl, and as you talk, 
There's no one near your joy to baulk, 
Oh, that's nice at a 
pic-nic party. 
She wants a 
flow'r, you try to leap 
A 
ditch, whose bank is very steep, 
And soon find out you've cause to weep, 
For you tumble in all of a 
heap; 
You howl with pain in madd'ning, grasps, 
The girl with terror her hands she clasps, 
For you've roll'd into a 
nest of wasps. 
Oh, the joys of a 
plc-nic party. 
So let's be merry and contrive 
how to keep tin game alive, 
On fun and frolic lot us thrive 
At this our pie-nie party-
A 
NORRIBLE TALE, 
As sung by M ISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
Oh, 
norrible tale I 
have to tell 
Of sal misfortunes which befell 
A 
family that once resided 
Just in the very same thoroughfare as I 
did. 
The pa-ri-cut was so grim a 
gutlin, 
Ile never liked no fun nor nuffin; 
In fact, he never made the feast endeavour 
To be facetious notsumnever. 
Cumtus. 
For (4a, it is such a 
norrible tale! 
'Twill make your faces all turn pale! 
Your eyes with grief quite overcome! I ! 
Twiddle, twaddle, twydle, twaddle, twin": I 
1 
Though a 
very respectable family 
They never saw no company; 
And every boy and every gal 
Grew hy-po-chon-der-i-a-cal. 
They fancied they had all sorts of sorroes 
And conjured up all kinds of horrors. 
Till each, with a 
face as long as a 
ladder 
Turned pale as a 
sheet if they saw their 9wn shadder. 
For oh, Su 
They sat with the curtains drawn down tight. 
On purpose to keep out the light; 
And the father, the mother, the sister, nor fix brother, 
:Never spoke a 
word to one another. 
At last this doleful, dismal lot, 
All so melancholy got, 
That an end to themselves they did agree 
To put, when they'd settled which end it was to be. 
For oh, & c. 
First, the father into the garden did walk, 
And beheaded hipisplf with a 
toasting fork; 
33 
And the motner an end to herself did put, 
Ry strangling herself with the waterbutt; 
Then the sister went (low:. on her bended knees, 
And drowned herself in toasted cheese; 
Whilst the brother, a 
most determined young feller, 
Wmit and poisoned himself with his gingham umbrella. 
For oh, &c. 
Then the baby in the little cradle 
Shot itself dead with its silver ladle; 
:And the servant-girl, seeing what it went and did, 
Smothered herself with the sauce-pan lid; 
The miserable cat by the kitchen fire 
le 
Swallowed the poker and did expire: 
And a 
fly on the cell:ng—this case was the wust 
Went and blew itself up with spontaneous combusti 
For 
Then in there walked the auctioneer, 
Who did with the furnituro disappear; 
And the broker's man— mind this arn't no fable— 
Ile made hisself away with the three-legged table. 
When the house saw this its sides it splits, 
The windows went cracked, and broke themselves to bits; 
And the roof got a 
tile off, and so dreadful was tills slang.h , 
ter-rate, 
on. 
oh, &c. 
That nutiln was left at last hut an unpaid water- rate. 
For oh, & c. 
Now, here's a 
moral, if yon choo,ie: 
Don't go and give way to the blues, 
fir you might come to those dreadful ends 
Of these my melancholy friends, 
You'll find to laugh whene'er you can 
Is a 
very sensible sort of plan, 
And if from my song - igh you caught of it, 
That is about the 1( ', e 
short of it.

MAMMA WON'T LET ME MA 
Sung by miss JENNIE EN 
TITNE.—" I shoul 
GEL. 
(1 like to marry." 
MAMM 
A. won't lA me marry, 
I'm sure I 
can't tell why— 
Now, isn't it provoking, 
And enough to make one cry? 
Jeminia says it's jealousy, 
But she goes rather far; 
My parent thinks herself too young, 
To be a 
grandmamma. 
But she will not let me marry yet; 
Oh dear, what shall I 
do ?— 
Now, isn't it a 
shameful thing 
To treat a 
daughter so ? 
Jeminia's cousin's sister's maid, 
Who lives at number six. 
Says she, " If I 
was you, M-iss Brown, 
The day I'd make her lix; 
For captains now are very scarce, 
And husbands hard to find; 
And if you do not hook your man, 
Perhaps he'll change his mind." 
But mamma won't let me marry yett 
Oh dear, what shall I 
do?— 
Now, isn't it a 
shameful thing 
To treat a 
daughter so? 
The captain says such pretty things, 
And calls me his heart's queen— 
I 
wonder he has not proposed 
A 
trip to Gretna Green. 
When I 
hinted at it t'other (lay, 
lIe smooth'd his glossy hair, 
Said he loved me to distraction, 
But he could not live on air. 
Oh, mamma won't let me marry yet; 
Oh dear, what shall I 
do ?— 
Now, isn't it a 
shameful thing 
To treat a 
daughter so? 
Miss Clark was married t'other day, 
(A nasty pert young jade); 
And now she's got an opera- box, 
And keeps her lady's-maid. 
The spiteful thing has dared to say— 
Oh dear, how very funny— 
That the captain does not care for me, 
But only wants my money. 
Mamma won't let me marry yet; 
Oh dear, what shall I 
do?— 
Now, isn't it a 
shameful thing 
To treat a 
daughter so? 
Those guardians and executors 
Are all on mischief bent; 
They too forbid my marrying 
Without mamma's consent. 
My fortune's at their mercy, 
So like a 
lonesome nun, 
I 
must pine hi single wretchedness, 
Until I'm twenty-one! 
For mamma won't let me marry yet; 
.0h, dear what shall I 
do?— 
Now, isn't it a 
shameful thing 
To treat a 
dauzliter so? 
IT'S well to be in love with one, 
But if there should be two, 
Both sighing for your heart and hand 
What can a 
poor girl do? 
I've one who always bothers me, 
No matter where I 
be, 
And whenever he gets a 
chance, 
Why then he says to me. 
Cuoncs. 
Susan, Susan, pity my confusion: 
Won't you, won't you, won't you marry me 
Susan, Susan, if you still refuse one, 
I 
shall, I 
shall, I 
shall D. I. E. 
As soon as number two is gone, 
Then in comes number one; 
" 
My own dear girl ( says he to me) 
Now tell me what I've done— 
That to my suit you will say no! 
It's cruel, upon my word ; 
Now, dear Sue, say, that you'll have me, 
And give up that chap absurd." 
Susan, &c. 
Of course I 
cannot wed them both, 
But between you and Sue, 
I 
don't much care for either one, 
So Ill give up the two; 
And somewhere e:se I'll find a 
beau, 
Who'll have a 
different way 
Of winning little Susan's heart, 
Than saying all the day—

With a

A smile was all she gave me. 
I 
sent her notes, I 
sent her flowers, 
I 
took her out a- riding: 
How quick time flies when love and sighs 
Are with the hours gliding! 
A 
rival was my only fear: 
And I 
couldn't think, to save me, 
That when 1. asked her who he was, 
A 
smile was all she gave me. 
Cherus. 
At last, a 
note, I 
got one day, 
And dreadful news it carried, 
Inviting me to come and see— 
Herself and rival married! 
Now off I 
went, on death was bent, 
Resolved that none should save me— 
But I 
am not dead, though she got wed, 
And a 
smile was all she gave me-

To those who have never perused the sad story of Cnamorra 
TEMTLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sympathised and 
wept with her in her sorrows, ad glowed with indignation at the 
wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, an oppor-
tunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works ever 
written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfortunato 
Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultlese, and her mind. 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane sad kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah I 
the cruel spoiler came--" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a 
striking 
example that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the 
end leads only to misery and shame.
