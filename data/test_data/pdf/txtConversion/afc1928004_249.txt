As sung by 
ALICE HARRISON, 
Music to be had of J. L. PET7:as, N.

I'm in love with such a 'harming little man. 
A musician in the military band, 
And I 
love Lhi better then goY. or wealh, 
When I 
sec 
17; ,aiform s.7, grand.. 
The first tira3 that 1 
met him, 
with love I 
was struck dumb, 
And my heart was in s. fluttl.r, 
When Charlie played the drum.

And it's

Oh ! my ! but I

70u its fun, 
When Chaney plays the drum. 
Oh! he often comes to take me for a 
walk, 
And we stray along together, side by side, 
And so sweetly and go lovingly he'll talk; 
And once he ask'd me if I'd be his bride. 
And ev'ry Thursday evening, 
AS SOOn LIS Work is done, 
I 
hasten to the park to hear 
My Charley play the drum. 
And it's One, two,.

GOOSE AND INGUNS. 
As sung by Son SIrrrn RUSSELL. 
Oh, dear! I'm nearly starving, 
1 
want something nice to eat, 
I 
fancy myself C.id r 
v 
i 
Lig ; 
Big pies and joints of meat. 
Roast pork or leg of mutton, 
To me would be of use ; 
And though I'm not a 
glutton, 
Still, I'd polish off a 
goose 
CHORUS. 
For it is my opinion, 
That stuffed with sage and ingm, 
No bird that flies is half so nice, 
As a 
goose with sage and ingun. 
Fill very fond of Turkey, 
Spring Chicken is good to take; 
Of Partridge or of Pheasant, 
A 
dinner I 
could make. 
I 
like corned beef and mustard, 
Or sirloin steak with juice, 
Or Prairie hen or Bustard fat, 
But most I 
love a 
Goose ! 
For it is my opinion, &c. 
I've liver tried, and bacon, 
And tripe both boiled and tried; 
A 
sheep's-head I 
have taken, 
And put myself outside. 
Though turtle soup is filling, 
And fish-balls joy produce; 
'Tis not the rapture or the joy, 
That appertains to goose! 
For it is my opinion, &c.

/ly thoughts are wand'ring back to-day 
On jcyous scenes of yore, 
The merry girls and boys at play 
Around the cottage door;

But sweetest vision of them all, 
The lane that led to school. 
CD:OLT:S. 
I 
see the moay, winding wall, 
'I he meadow, trook and pool, 
But sweetest vision of them all 
The lane that led to school. 
The birds are singing just as sweet 
Upon the chestnut boughs, 
The youthful lovers, as they meet, 
Exchange the oldc.r vows ; 
I 
see the fite'ds in vcrdant gown, 
And fool the breezes cool, 
That used to blow so gently dawn 
The lane that led to school. 
I 
see the mossy, &a. 
The woods are ringing, far and near 
With shouts of boyish glee,

And why your drooping cyclias cloao 
Oh, darling, tell me this? 
To me you are the fairest flow'r, 
The sweetest bud I

But if my love you can't return, 
Why don't you toll me ? 
No satisfaction, to. 
Why is it that you cannot love

PULL DOWN THE BLIND. 
As si,i2g by TONY PASTOIL', 
DID you ever make love ? If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxiti;2,- tual wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ey' ry niLrLt to her hoase, I 
went, 
In harmless der gilt our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
qleer saying,Ivhateve:t it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered Ler home she would say : 
cnoni:s. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, conic don't be unkind, 
Though were alone, bear this in mind, 
Sornebof.ly's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
Flow loving we wer, how cosy we'd chat, 
'flout one thing and ('other, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waist, bow cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle- doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and ple..sino- we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to mak t 
our hearts glad, 
With lau:_ddn- and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; , 
But still she was awfully spooney on me. 
SPONEN.—And if that soldier would only have left us alone, 
she would never havu exclaimed: 
• 
Pull down the, blind, etc. 
One night, for a 
change, we went to the Play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was •• Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She called me her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, wine fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOKEN,—Just at that moment apolicemm passed, and Elie 
said: 
Pull CIONV11 t116 blind, etc.. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, she calls me Ned, 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
fine litualsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow, never us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful I'm blessed with a 
good little w 
fe.

should an angry word rise to my lips, with

"get away George, you're always saying something," that 
means yes, yes it does, so I 
says to her, says I, 111 go and have 
our names put in the morning vipers, and then ill go to the

YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL Mt 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
WHEN a 
child I 
lived at Lincoln with my parents at the farm, 
lessons that my =ther tanght to me were quite a 
charm; 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of childish 
play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mother 
say— 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach; 
Let your wutchword be " dispotch," and practice what you 
preach; 
Do not let your chances, like sunbeams, pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief- making boy, 
Destruction seent'd my only sport, it was my only joy; 
And well do I 
reino:nc-:', when ofttimes well chastised, 
how father sat b:-side me then and thus has me advised. 
Waste not, tfro. 
When I 
arrived at manhood, I 
embark d 
in public 
And found it was a 
ragged road bestrewn with care and etrila; 
I 
speculated foo isbly. my losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny, littio voice Rept whisp':ing in mine car. 
Waste not, S
IC. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, and found, to my surprise, 
My funds, instead of sinking, very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasp'd each chance and alwars struck the iron while '
twat 
hot, 
I 
Seiz'd my opportunities and never <Ina% forgot-
-Waste rot, IrA. 
• 
Im' married now and happy , I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony, devoid of care and strife; 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have little children three, 
The lessons that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee 
Is. waste not. &-c. 
Sung by JOHN Frt-77)nco. 
If you have health, if you have wealth, 
If you intend to enjoy yourself; 
If you want pleasur2, if you want sport, 
Just take a 
trip to New York ; 
Walk through the City, 
There ycu'll 'find pictures I 
think of every kind, 
If yotT fool weary, not up to the mark, 
Then take a 
gentle walk through the Park. 
Cr:oats. 
There you can lie beneath the trees, 
Enjoying yourslf with the greatest of ease, 
Wink at the girls just as you please, 
Idling the time away. 
You feel so jolly lighthearted and gay ; 
Perhaps to a 
girl these words you say :— 
I 
mean to enjoy myself to day, 
Whate'er the expenses may be ; 
You treat her to one or two bottles of beer, 
Then you get spooney—call her your dear, 
Say that you love her, to her you'll be ',mo— 
rn fact, anything in this world say you'll do. 
There you can lie, az, 
You stay there perhaps some hours, 
Watching the bees, the birds, and the flowers, 
Exercising all your power 
To get her to name the day; 
First she'll say yes, then she'll my no, 
Then she'll say Fred, don't bother me so, 
But if it will please you, it will give me delight, 
To give you an answer going home to-night. 
There you can lie, 1.:c. 
Beneath the trees no longer you stay, 
But for home you hasten away, 
Back to the City you return again, 
And see the girl home to her door, 
You kiss her, caress her, squeeze her hand tight, 
And after some talk bid her good night,— 
Tell her you have an income for life, 
And then she'll consent to become your wife,.

BY THE OLD MILL STREAM. 
STIng by JOHN 1
713ELDDTG. 
You must know that my Uncle is a 
farmer 
Keeps a 
large farm in the West, 
While staying there I 
met a 
little charmer 
And many's a 
time I 
carressed 
That girl so fair, with nut Lrown hair, 
Her equal ne'er was seen ; 
And where I 
met this charming little pet, 
Was down by the old mill stream. 
Cnonus. 
Down by the old mill stream, 
There many happy hours I've seen, 
Strolling day by day, we passed the time twan 
Down by the old mill stream. 
Her father was the owner of a 
dairy, 
Her brother worked the plough, 
And while I 
used to roam with little Mary, 
Her mother would milk the cow; 
But her father said, " We should not wed," 
Which I 
thought rather mean, 
As she could not be my 
wife, she said ' • She'end her lib 
By drowning, in the old mill stream. 
Down by the old =ill, 10. 
Nave the old man !  g;d ?laughter, 
S.ayinee 
dent belicy3 a ' vcrd that you say," 
But v;hen he saw her E:,t-aggling in the water, 
He exclaimed, 
Do sari her pray?" 
But it was .1 
oo late, she had met her fate, 
Oh : what a 
terrible scene ! 
The old man cried, as the neighbors tried 
Tc- pull her out of the stream. 
Down by the old mill, &e:. 
At last they got her out of the water, 
And some of the neighbors said, 
"Oh! Crown you've been the ruin of your daughters 
Pc: the girl is really dead !" 
Ho ter3 his hair gave way to despair, 
Ian away, never more was seen. 
And now I'm told the dairy is sold, 
That stood by the old mill stream.

High in my window two love-birds 
flung in their cage for a 
summer long; 
Their passion had not the relief of words, 
And they did not appear to know a 
song; 
But there they nestled upon the perch, 
Beak to beak in a 
loveable way, 
Like two young lovers just fresh from church, 
And a 
look in their eyes that seemed to say— 
Cn.ours. 
Hours go by 
We'll mark them with a 
kiss. 
Hours go by

The time we pass in lissing, 
Tilc time we pass in hissing 
Is time we never miss. 
My bird's example spread far and wide ; 
There in the window they kiss'd and coo'd, 
'Till it soften'd the hearts of folks outside, 
And quite affected the neighborhood; 
And love grew in fashion mo:c and yet more; 
All thro' the terrace filfrtation so rag'd, 
That no one of twenty, few of two score, 
But was either just wed or else engaged.

HER FATHER'S SHOP, 
BY SOHN FIELDING. 
Last Easter Monday I 
went out, 
Ad 
took a 
trip to Troy, 
Twas there I 
met this darling girl, 
Of whom to sing Ill try. 
'Twas on the steamer we first met, 
Next at Doolen's Calico Hop, 
When she told me her name and then 
Described her father's shop. 
SPosEs. — She said her father sold— 
Soap, starch and candles. turnips, starch and turpentine, 
Paper, glue and mustard, sweet oil and scents, 
Black lead and clothes lines, firewood and brandy wines, 
Colors mixed for painting, pots and brushes lent! 
We saw them play at kiss in the ring, 
We joined them in the scene ; 
She always threw the glove to me, 
To chase her round the green. 
And when I 
caught her, oh! what bliss, 
To span her slender waist ; 
But when I 
kissed her, then I 
thought 
'Twas Heaven such lips to taste I 
SPMEN.—All but one thing, I 
thought I 
could detect 
slight flavor of— 
Soap, starch, &o. 
When night closed in, I 
saw her hume, 
It was not very nr ; 
When we got there, she introduced 
Me to her Pa and Ma. 
I 
said I 
hoped they were quite well, 
And then I 
heaved a 
sigh; 
And said, I 
hoped we should one day 
lie joined by a 
closer tio. 
SnornnN.—And when I 
sighed L-nlies and Gentlemen, 
you can believe me, when I 
say I 
1
-eit very queer—not being 
used to the odor of— 
f-'oap. starch, &c. 
But now I'm used to all the smells, 
For I 
spend most of my time 
Behind the counter, for I 
think, 
'Twill one clay be mine. 
Last week the old folks gave consent, 
Now all my fears have 110 ; 
Next week will end my single life, 
I 
shall be a 
married man instead.

And love is in its prime. 
The only fellow for making love, 
Is he who drinks his wine. 
You never lind him bashful, 
The wine tills him with life, 
He don't speak unheard, but out with the word, 
Will you be mine own (hurling wife? 
He don't speak unheard. but out with the word, 
Will you be mine own darling wife ?

And makes us young as May.

To the girl he's made his wife, 
The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
Then he's led a

The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
For he's kid a

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy Temple. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
ch ildren." 
It depifts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those around us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the }Holiest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and 
ir resulting from once yield-
ing to the seductive innueecc of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in rant attention to the end.

The autli ,-,r 
of this work is well known as an extensive

some valuable additions to American

The work 
we are now n3ticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on intchaiws treat the subject in a manner 
which is not avat'able to young men commencing as appren-
tices in sh.)ps. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only sable for a 
text-book, but also as a wcik 
of reference. 
Liost amOitious young men will make them-
selves so ramiliat• with it 
contents as to be able to refer 
really to any p ) rt,on of the book.
