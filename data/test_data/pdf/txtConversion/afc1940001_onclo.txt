Mrs. DenoonOn [Cloddie's?] BanksAs I stepped out one evening, 'twas in the month of MayDown by
a flower garden I happened [ to ?] to strayI overheard a [female?] in sorrow did complainHow the far
and absent lover [who?] plowed the distant Main.I stepped up to her, I took her on surprisesI knew
she wouldn't know me for I was in disguise"Oh, where are you going my own heart's delight?Oh,
where are you going this dark and rainy night.""I'm hunting for a young man, young Johnnie is his
name,And on the bankes of Cloddie I'mm told he does remain,On the banks of Cloddie if you would
please do show And pity have for a female, for there I [n] bound to go[."?]
[Pilya?] maid distracted?
"It's on the banks of Cloddie on which you now  stand ? But never mind young Johnnie, for he's a
false young man.Oh, never mind young Johnnie, for he'll not need your here;Just stay with me in the
green wood, no danger need you fear."If Johnnie was here this night, he'd free me from all harm,But
he's on the field of battle dressed in his uniform;He's on the field of battle for honor and great
gain.""The ship's been wrecked, so I have been told, all on her way from Spain."When she heard
this dreadful news, she fell into dispair,[With?] wringing of her hands and tearing of her hair,Saying,
"If Johnnie's gone, no other will I take,Through the lonesome hills and valleys, I'll ramble for his
sake."When I heard this joyful news, I could no longer stand,I caught 'er in my arms, saying, "Molly,
I am the man.Saying, I'mm that man that's caused you all this pain,And since we meet on Cloddie's
Banks, we'll never part again."
