TIIE limited space afforded in the pages of a 
work 
of this description for a 
Memoir of the peculiarly 
original and justly celebrated Composer and Banjo-
ist, Mr. Charles H. Fox, may readily be perceived, 
and also that the requirements of brevity at once 
compel us to omit many incidents, themselves 
pleasing, in the life of one so well known to the New 
York public. 
The subject of this short sketch was born in 
Brooklyn, N. Y. Nov. 15th, 1828, at a 
time when his 
native city had just, by a 
rapid increase of popula-
tion, began to assume a 
noticeable importance in the 
Union. 
Ile was at an early age sent to a 
Ward 
School, where, besides displaying a 
generous dispo-
sition toward his comrades, and by his equitable 
temper gaining their esteem, he secured the warm-
est approval of his teachers. 
Not long, however, 
was he destined here to pursue his studies, for in 
less thin three years, when but ten years of age, we 
find him before his father, John Fox's, forge, learn-
ing the trade of a 
blacksmith. 
With his father he 
remained until 1840. 
In 1848 he made his first appearance on the Ethi-
opian stage, as violinist to an amateur company 
bearing the name of" Fox's African Minstrels," and 
played at Stapleton, Staten Island. 
The entertain-
ments, which at this period he led, notwithstanding 
Vi 
MEMOIR. 
the toils and anxieties incidental thereto, were the 
delights of his life, and strenuously did he exert him-
self to make them successful. 
The educational opportunities which were lost by 
his early removal from school were amply made up 
by arduous efforts at self- culture, ever afterwards 
pursued, and it is to that indomitable perseverance, 
as well as genius inherent, he owes his present 
position. 
To satisfy his desire for change of scene, and 
acquire knowledge unobtainable at home, except in 
a 
limited degree, like many of the Ethidpian profes-
sionals lie became attached to a 
company of travel-
ing Minstrels, and with them performed in many of 
the principal Cities and Towns in the United States, 
every where meeting with merited success—his 
unique compositions producing unbounded roars of 
laughter. 
The following pages contain a 
portion of 
his numerous songs and sayings, fraught with 
laughter-stirring wit and pleasantries. 
After a 
period of six years of travel, profitable both 
in a 
monetary and experimental sense, he returned 
to New York in 1854, and ever since has been 
employed in companies of great respectability in 
that city. 
At present he performs nightly at Wood's Min-
strels, where his versatile talents as composer, banjo-
ist, and tamborinist, holds him in a 
position he 
fills with increasing popularity, viz.: the very head 
and front of Ethiopian Minstrelsy.

CHARLEY FOX'S 
ETHIOPIAN SONGSTER. 
What Can't be Cured. 
Oh, youth and folly make young men marry,— 
So far you well, love, I'm goin away; 
What can't be cured, love, must be endured— 
Then, so far you well, I 
must away. 
CHORUS: What can't be cured, love, must be endured, 
So far you well, I'm goin away. 
She cried and sighed, oh! when we parted, 
Says I, my dear, wipe your tears away ; 
She says to me, John, I'm broken hearted, 
To think you're going far upon the sea. 
CHORUS: What can't be cured, &c. 
My heart is sad, lovely Johnny dear, 
To think you'd leave your sweet Sally here; 
Your auburn hair did my heart ensnare, 
An your gimlet eyes bored a 
hole thro' me. 
CHORUS: What can't be cured, &c. 
CHARLEY FOX'S 
Cloe in de Cellar. 
Composed for Charley Fox by T. Vaughn. 
Down on de Susquehanna bank, 
I 
often used to roam, 
While listening to de banjo twang, 
Would wander from my home. 
My thoughts would often mingle 
Wiu a 
crowd of lovely fair, 
And then my heart would jingle 
Wid a 
wish dat I 
was dare. 
CHORUS: '
Twas dar I 
loved a 
colored gal 
I 
often seed afore, 
So early in de morning, 
Peeping froo de cellar door. 
One day Miss Cloe---dat was her name— 
Invited me to tea, 
She said her lub was all de same, 
No consequence to me; 
And when she spoke, her voice so sweet, 
It sounded in my ear 
Just like ten thousand whip-poor-wills, 
She sung so very clear. 
CHORUS: '
Twas dar I 
loved, &c. 
I 
left dat night contented, 
For to lub her ebermore; 
To kiss her in a 
hurry 
I 
fell froo de cellar door; 
My head went in de fire, 
And my heels stuck in de wall, 
Miss Cloe was safe as eber, 
But loudly she did bawl. 
CHORUS: '
Twas dar I 
loved, &e. 
SENTIMENTS OF A. HUNGRY MAN.—Pea soup. 
Blow ye Winds. 
I 
am a 
clever darky, my name is Shoepeg Sam, 
I 
used to work for Sausage Bill, on board de Taleran; 
One morning my ole massa died, I 
thor't it would 
not do, 
I 
sung an played dis good ole tune, an brought de 
ole man to. 
Cuonus: Den blow ye winds ob morning, blow ye 
winds, I 
oh ! 
Den blow ye winds ob morning, blow— 
blow—blow. 
White folks listen to dis song dat I'm a 
gwine to 
sing, 
I'll sing it loud for young an ole, an make de banjo 
ring; 
Be white folks lubs de ole banjo, de darkey lubs 
him too, 
I'll make it hum like Taylor did de guns in Mexico. 
CHORUS: Den blow ye winds, &c. 
About three hundred years ago de war it did begin, 
Be solgers dey was dead in snow dat laid upon de 
green; 
I 
said to Uncle Safelock John, dis ting will never do, 
So I 
sung an play'd on dis banjo, an brought dena 
solgers to. 
Cnomys: Den blow ye winds ob morning, &c. 
" 
Pompey, what are girls like'?" 
" 
1Val, Sam, I 
would say dat dey was very much 
like arrows." 
" 
Why so 1" 
" 
Kase dey are all in a 
quiver till de beaux come, 
and dey can't go off widout ' em.

CHARLEY PDX'S 
Johnny's Equal is not here. 
Oh! Johnny, lubly Johnny dear, what makes you 
look so queer, 
flab you been eatin sassengers or drinking lager 
beer 7 
flab you been in de riber trying to pull de shad 
poles up 
An found they'd broke in two, and then had to gib 
it up 1 
CHORUS: Oh! Johnny, lubly Johnny dear, 
Your equal is not here. 
If Johnny was de Alderman of New York City town, 
He'd shut de Dutchman's grocery stores or license 
must cum down, 
He'd stop de cars from running on de Sunday of de 
week, 
Let ladies an de gemmun make railroads of dere 
feet. 
CHORUS: Oh! Johnny, &c. 
He'd take the Broadway pavement and he'd pull it 
right straight up, 
To keep de horses on dere feet, for falling is dere 
luck •, 
He'd make de sidewalks wider, for to let the ladies 
pass, 
To keep the gemlan's boots and shoes from tearing 
all dere garments. 
CHORUS: Oh! Johnny, &c. 
" 
What is de difference between a 
young lady and 
an old hat 1" 
" 
Don't know."

New York City. 
At New York City I

see, 
The ladies dey are hansome, an dey look right 
straight at me, 
Bey tell me dat dey lub me all about de heel an de 
toe,— 
Oh! ladies, do not flatter, now I 
tell you it's no go. 
CHORUS: /New York City, it am de place to be, 
Be ladies dey are hansome, and dey are 
all in lub wid me. 
be gals in New York City, dey dress so neat an gay, 
Day promenade on Sunday wid de gemmen on 
Broadway, 
Pere hats dey wear 'em gallus, an dey bang off well 
behind, 
When going round de corner dem last you're sure 
to find. 
CHORUS: New York City, &c. 
De Dutchmen of New York, dey lib all round about, 
Dey get up in de mornin an dey eat dere sauer kraut, 
Bey drink dere lager beer, an dey cut a 
mighty swell, 
Free hundred licenses for to pay to keep a 
big Hotel. 
Cnonus: New York City, & c. 
New Jordan; 
OR, DE RIGHT OF SEARCH. 
Written for C. H. Fox, Esq., and sung by him with shouts of 
laughter and applause. 
People's talking long enough 
Of de British in de gulf, 
Dere exploits and everything accord'n, 
But if dey fool wid Uncle Sam, 
Why he'll like a 
damn, slam, 
An send 'ern to cle oder side o' Jordan. 
CHORUS: From Cuba in de South, 
It's in everybody's mouth, 
What de telegraph reports every mornin, 
Loud talk is often made 
Of the Cuba slave trade, 
Dat's carried on on dat side o' Jordan. 
De British from dere perch 
Essayed de right of search, 
But Yankee skippers know dere duty accord'n, 
If dey give 'em too much slack 
About de Union Jack, 
Dey'll send 'ern to de oder side o' Jordan. 
CHORUS: From Cuba, &c. 
Spoken: De rule in warfare is dis: 
De British fire a 
shot, 
Kase dere feeling rader hot, 
But Bartlett took no notice dat mornin, 
His flag lay on de cabin table, 
And he asked if dey IA ere able 
To take him to de oder side o' Jordan. 
CHORUS: From Cuba, &c. 
Nicaragua. 
As I 
was a 
walking down de street, 
De pretty gals I 
chance to meet; 
I 
thort I'd stop in and sing a 
little song 
For de white folks— it won't take me long. 
When my song you've heard it'll make you holler, 
You'll stretch your necks right out ob your collar, 
You'll jump right up, saying, " Gib me anoder cup!" 
I'm off to Nicaragua in de morning. 
CHORUS 
To de land, to de land, to de land, to de 
land, 
Oh! oh! oh! oh! 
Then far you well, white folks, I 
bid you 
all adieu, 
I'm off to Nicaragua in de morning.

CHARLEY PDX'S 
Now de "lards and de Softs has had a 
mighty time, 
All about the election; 
Them long-headed Whigs and Democrats 
Are looking for satisfaction. 
But de Know-Nothin chaps, wid dere Wide-Awal:e 
hats, 
Are traveling very fast, oh ; 
The first thing you know they'll be a—not oh! 
Then I'm off for Nicaragua right away. 
CHORUS: 
To de land, &c. 
De times is berry hard in New York city; 
Some folks why dat am a 
great pity; 
Flour is very high, pork an sausage, too, 
An mighty little work for de poor folks to do. 
But cheer up, my friends, and don't feel sad, 
There's a 
good time comm n 
what ain't very bad; 
ill bet you half a 
dollar to a 
buckwheat cake 
That the next Buchanan is wide, wider ' wake.

For de eels an pickerel.

She was just de gal for dis ole cuff; 
She could hoe de green tobae 
On de banks of Potomac;

Good Bargain. 
" 
Mr. Snow, did you eber hear me sing'?" 
"

" 
Oh, yes, Mr. Snow, I

singer in my day. 
Yes, sir! I 
got once ten dollars 
for singing one tune," 
" 
What, ten dollars for singing one tune '1 Why, 
that was certainly good, Pompey. 
How did you 
get it 7" 
" 
Well, you see, I 
went to a 
party one night, an in 
de korse ob de night, a 
gemmun sed he would like 
to hear me sing. 
I 
s'pose they must hab heard ob 
rne in de papers—de Police Gazette or some oders." 
" 
Yes ; no doubt." 
" 
Well, this gemmun sed be would give me five 
dollars if I 
would oblige him wid a 
song." 
" 
Why, Pompey, you said you got ten dollars; five 
is only half." 
" 
Well, dat's only half de story. 
I 
pocketed de 
five dollars and began. I 
had only got froo two 
lines when anoder gem'mun steps up an says be 
would gib me five dollars to stop."

Wid your tight legged pants, so de colored folks say, 
Your Byron collar an such a

An patent lever boots clear down to your toes; 
Your fh,fer is slender, as de poets tell, 
You're slim as a 
rail, I 
know very well, 
You look like my cousin—his name was Slim Jim, 
He says de liquor law isn't going to stop his gin. 
CHORUS: Rat-e

She went right away wid a

Of gemman, b'hoys an little dandies.

Bobbing. Around. 
Oh she an me went on a 
spree, 
Bobbin around, around, around, 
I 
kissed her and she kissed me, 
As we went bobbin around. 
I 
felt so real all-fired good, 
Bobbin around, around, around, 
In kissin her I 
tore her hood, 
As we went bobbin around. 
She give me a 
slap, I 
felt it too, 
Bobbin around, around, around, 
It turned my eye very black and blue, 
As we went bobbin around. 
I 
told her that I 
didn't care, 
Bobbin around, around, around, 
Wid dat she tried to pull my hair, 
Again I 
bobbed around. 
I 
sod to her you've cruel been, 
Bobbin around, around, around, 
We kissed an made it up agin, 
Den we both went bobbin around.

Wide Awake. 
De oder day I 
arrived in town, 
De breakfast bell was ringin; 
I 
gladly took de banjo down, 
And dis same tune was singin. 
CHORUS: Wide awake, bake de cake, 
Wake up, Ginger, hear me sing, 
Don't you hear de banjo ring 7 
I 
did not stay, I 
did not go, 
I 
thort it was so funny, 
I 
was not fast, I 
was not slow 
To eat hoe- cake and honey. 
Cifonus: Wide awake, &c. 
Dat breakfast bell, dat breakfast bell, 
An bery long it tolls, 
At rnornin den you hear de knell ' 
Of buckwheat cakes an rolls.

De chimbley may refuse to draw, 
De mornin may be dark, 
But spite of all domestic law, 
Dat bell will toe de mark.

Experience ob a Muleteer. 
Oh! I 
hab tra.beled far an wide, 
An seen great many sights, 
I 
used behind de mules to ride, 
To stop dem as dey bites. 
Wid poles I 
used to poke 'era up, 
An teach 'em what to do; 
1 
Widin dere ears I 
made a 
cup, 
To rattle stones right thronzh ! 
CHORUS: Kip, Boney whee! I 
used to cry, 
Don't you know me? Whee! mind yer 
eye ! 
Whoa dar! 
Back Dobbin! whoa! 
I'be trabeled on de steamboat route, 
An seen skies sweet an blue, 
I'be fished behind for pickled trout 
An found it wouldn't do. 
For once, instead ob shinin fish, 
I 
hooked a 
splendid bag, 
I 
asked de cook to hand a 
dish, 
To hold de drownded rag. 
Company: And what did he say 7 
CHORUS: Git out dere, you blind cullered man, 
You stole dat purse from dis ere ma'an 
Now oberboard you goes right off. 
I 
went a-sailin round de world, 
In de ship de Ole Moon, 
An dere came once a 
hurry- whirl, 
Dat dey called tipo-foon; 
De lightning blazed, de sky looked mad, 
As crazy tings afore hab done, 
De ship she broke an den I 
had 
Into de sea to run. 
Company: How was that 7 
CHORUS: De mast it fell an broke de planks, 
De shrouds came down an all de shanks, 
De sea it swallowed me right up. 
I 
laid on a 
rock an made a 
raft, 
An prayed as ne'er before, 
I 
prayed de winds to gently waft, 
An bear us to de shore. 
•

CHARLEY FOX'S 
De winds war deaf, dey wouldn't hear, 
Nor take us to de shore, 
So I 
begged de waves dat war near, 
To drown us—nary more. 
Company: What did you say 7 
CHORUS: Blow ye winds, blow now gently o'er, 
Bring us some news from yonder shore; 
An, please you, something to eat. 
I 
bought me once a 
litttle cot 
Dat in a 
pine grove stood, 
But dere alone o'er my sad lot 
I 
oft an oft did brood. 
I 
bibbed a 
bright;eyed yaller gal, 
An she did lub me, too, 
So den I 
red, My dearest Sal, 
Will you I 
marry you 
Company: What did your lady-love say 1

My dearest Will, for you I 
sigh ; 
You are my life, my all, my— 
Company: llo bo! 
I'be seen de tad-poles in de stream, 
An seen 'em on de bank, 
I'be seen mud- turtles on de beam, 
Pat seed me an den sank; 
I'be heard de cat-bird on de tree, 
An felt de wee gnat's sting 
I'be heard de tree-toad querily 
Try dis sweet song to sing. 
Conzpany: What song

Oh I

Ob all de songs I 
eber sung, 
Pis am de best, de greatest one; 
"Pis ob a 
darkey full of fun, 
Dey call him One-Eyed Josey; 
He used to dress himself so neat, 
Win high-heeled boots on his feet, 
De gals would whisper in de street, 
Look! dar goes One-Eyed Josey •

CHORUS 
Den here's de chorus, sing away, 
To-morow will be holiday ; 
Get de fiddle, let us play, 
To please ole One-Eyed Josey. 
Den in a 
ball- room ebery night, 
To dance an sing was his delight, 
De gals would pull him left an right, 
Because it was dere notion. 
But then one night he danced so high, 
lie run his heels in a 
colored gal's eye, 
Oh golly me ! but didn't she cry ! 
Unlucky One-Eyed Josey ! 
CHORUS : Den here's de chorus, &c. 
But after dat be went, no more, 
Dey laid his head beneath de floor, 
his tombstone mark is on de door, 
Here died poor One-Eyed Josey. 
When loving friends you know is dear, 
You cannot help but drop a 
tear, 
And thinkin they are always near 
'Tis so wid One-Eyed Josey.
