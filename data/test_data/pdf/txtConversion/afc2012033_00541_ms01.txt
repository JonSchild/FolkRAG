VC: So I’m back here this morning, and this is the 17th of April, to do a follow-up interview with Andy, 
and thanks again. 
AG: No problem! 
VC: You’ve been very kind to do this. This is a project that’s turning out very well for us, I think. We’ve 
got lots of good information from people and helpful people like you.  
AG: Good. 
VC: So we have a random bunch of questions. We went back and listened to the interview that I’d done 
with you and thought of some things that were- lot of the time before we were talking about specifics of 
farming and the specifics of this farm and all that. But there’s some more, kind of, philosophical 
questions too we thought of. So, there’s no particular order to these, but could you kind of give me, 
Andy, a month by month, season by season what happens on the farm? You can do it month by month 
or season by season- 
AG: Yes. As far as the—we really run two businesses. We run the dairy business, which is year round. 
Everything is pretty much the same all the time. Cows, you have cows calving, cows going dry, having 
calves. So that business is pretty stable. It just does the same thing. The other part of it, we run—people 
don’t think of a dairy farm as having two separate businesses, but most dairies here grow all their own 
feed. So the feed growing part of the business is a separate enterprise in a lot of parts of the country. 
The feed growing enterprise, what we do in the wintertime is we spend most of the winter, we get done 
combining corn November, December and we spent most of the winter in the shop, the guys do. Fixing 
equipment, rebuilding planters, rebuilding trucks, going through mowing machines, ‘til right about the 
first of April. Then we start in spreading manure and we doing seeding of alfalfa and grass seedings 
come next. We plant corn, this is a very compressed time of year because we’re trying to plant all the 
corn we plant plus do our first crop of hay, which comes off the end of May. So you’re trying to get all 
your corn planted in time to get- and sometimes we don’t get the corn all planted, we quit and cut hay 
because we need the hay quality. And then the summertime you have three or four cuts of alfalfa hay 
and two cuts of grass hay in between. So you start in May with the alfalfa, then you do grass, then you 
do second cutting of alfalfa, third cutting alfalfa, second cutting grass, then fourth cutting alfalfa. Then 
you chop corn silage in the fall and you harvest grain corn after that. Interspersed among all that you’re 
spreading manure, because we produce a lot of manure, these cows do. So we’re putting manure on 
crop ground. Lot of manure goes on the ground to grow corn. Manure has a lot of nitrogen, it’s a great 
corn fertilizer and we put manure on the grass ground because grass needs nitrogen too. And we haul 
the manure everywhere, to comply with our CAFO plan to spread it all out so we’re not overloading any 
of the ground. 
VC: That’s part of the requirement? 
AG: It’s part of the requirement, yeah. But it also makes sense because fertilizer is very expensive, 
commercial fertilizer, so you’re trying to use the fertilizer you produce to recycle the nutrients. So we’re 
hauling manure. Like today, we hauled miles. Tractor trailers run all the time hauling manure here, 
there, and everywhere. So we cover every field. We have a specific cropping plan for every field, so we 
know how much manure it gets and keep track of all that. So that’s basically how the year goes, it’s 
quieter in the winter with the cropping, but the cow end is the same all the time.  
VC: So three or four, four cuttings of hay?  
AG: Yup. Well, we get two cuttings of grass and four cuttings of alfalfa.  
VC: So it starts in April- 
AG: May. The end of May. 
VC: And it goes ‘til- 
AG: Depends on the year. Like this year we’ll be later a little bit than last year. Because of course nothing 
is growing by now and it’s the 17th of April. Last year we were in the field working and we had a beautiful 
early spring. So it all depends on the year. If we have a late enough spring and the cooler weather, we 
won’t only get three cuts of alfalfa. So it all depends on the year. 
VC: Right, right. So when you say alfalfa, it’s planted or is it just simply- 
AG: Oh no, alfalfa’s planted. It’s a perennial, but over time it’s reseeded. What we do is, our rotation 
would be corn and alfalfa. Corn for three or four or five years, then alfalfa for three or four or five years. 
And then alfalfa dies out, since it’s a perennial, if you get freezing and thawing the taproots get snapped 
off or plants die and it doesn’t reseed itself. It is only a grass that grows- 
VC: What are the special qualities of alfalfa? 
AG: It’s higher in—it’s tremendous cow feed. It’s higher in protein than grass. It will regenerate more in 
warm weather and you can get four cuts out of it. And it—well, grass can be good if it’s cut the right 
time, but you can get a lot more yield with the alfalfa. 
VC: They used to talk about timothy, is that still used? 
AG: Oh yeah, some of our grass hay—we have different grass hay varieties—Reed’s canary, timothy is 
one of them. Timothy is—doesn’t seem to, the varieties aren’t as good. It doesn’t grow back as good as 
the Reed’s canary. If you take a Reed’s canary grass and you do it right and you want to cut it a lot, you 
can make really good feed out of it. Timothy it tends to be a cool season grass. You get a lot of growth 
early in the year and then you get growth later when it cools off in the fall. It doesn’t seem to grow as 
well in the middle of the heat of the summer. Alfalfa will grow in the hot weather. Plus alfalfa has a tap 
root so it can go down and get water. Timothy is shallow rooted; most grasses are. So in the 
summertime you’ll see alfalfa growing back nice and green and everything and the timothy will be just 
sitting there because of lack of moisture. The tap root on alfalfa will go down six, eight feet to get water. 
VC: Now on your operation, the field crops and all that, that’s your brother’s responsibility? 
AG: Yes, my brother, and my nephew helps him some, but my brother mostly. Yeah, I don’t do anything 
with cropping. What I’m telling you is just general stuff. I couldn’t tell you what varieties of corn they 
plant. They pick all that. 
(0:06:40)  
VC: That’s all good, that’s fine. Talk through with me the major changes. 1980 was a big year for you, 
right? 
AG: I came home, yeah.  
VC: So like the major changes since then. 
AG: Well the big thing that covers everything is the technology of it. So you look on the cow end. The 
technology is way better vaccines. So we have vaccination for things like klebsiella and e. coli that are 
tremendous. We have genomic testing so that the genetics is better of the animals. We use artificial 
insemination so the genetics is way better. The ability to balance rations from research, we can do a 
great job balancing for specific amino acids, we balance for different kinds of protein, we balance how 
much rumen-degradable protein comes though the rumens. So all that technology. On the crop side, 
same thing. The new corn varieties are just tremendous. They have drought resistance; they have all 
kinds of traits of help them yield better. The yield on the corn—we used to average—if we did a 110 or 
20 bushels per acre it was great. We can average a 170 or 80. Same land and everything. The 
equipment—you’ve got GPS that can steer tractors, you’ve got corn planters, the equipment is just way 
better too. There’s been tremendous improvement in the equipment technology. And that’s allowed us 
to have more animals and be bigger. Computers. If you had to keep records on this many cows on a 
handbook system, you’d have to have a full-time person just keeping track of who calved and when 
they’re going to have to be dry. The computer all does it. 
VC: Sure. 
(0:08:32) 
AG: We have a program on here that keeps track of how much we feed every day, called “Feedwatch.” 
We can even figure, do the waybacks; some of the cows don’t feed, we wayback and put into the heifer 
diets to save feed, and the computer figures how much grain’s in the waybacks, then figures out how 
much grain the heifers need and then can readjust the ration for the heifers. So it’s all that kind, it’s 
technology, it’s just great. 
VC: Sure. Then specifically for this farm, you’ve made significant changes in the actual structures, the 
buildings.  
AG: Oh, the milking parlor again is a technological marvel. It weighs how much milk they give, keeps 
track of their activity. These free stall barns with the high side walls and the better ventilation. Forty, 
fifty years ago we didn’t have curtains on the side of barns. Well, cows make a lot of heat, so you can 
lower the curtains. The ventilation’s way better. Stall design is better. 
[Phone rings] 
VC: Do you need to get that? 
AG: No, I don’t need to. I don’t ever answer this, because it’s just a fax number. We get a lot of—they’re 
telemarketer calls. Anybody that wants me calls my cell phone. So this barn, these barns are way 
better—are you on, still on? 
VC: Yes. 
AG: The technology of these barns, we’ve got fans in there, sprinklers that turn on the electric eye in the 
summer to wash it down. We’re adding brushes to brush ‘em off, so that it cleans all the hair and the 
dirt of of ‘em. We just know more about taking care of cows and doing a better job with ‘em than we 
ever did.  
VC: And you told me at length before about the changes in the acreage and the number of farms you’ve 
acquired, so I think we’ve pretty well covered that. I thought specifically, the answers you just gave me 
were exactly the kind of answers, the impact of technology and so forth. 
AG: Good. Well, one of the things you don’t think about, people don’t think about, the guy working on 
the field, driving these tractors with air-conditioned cabs, a nice seat to sit in, versus an old W4 we had 
that just about shake you to death when you’re out in the open. They’re not anywhere near as easy to 
operate, no power steering, you had to hang right on. So it’s completely better for the operator, to 
operate them. We have some retied guys that work for us. They couldn’t—you wouldn’t want at that 
age, you wouldn’t want to run one of those old tractors. 
VC: No. 
AG: You couldn’t stand it. Your back and shoulders and everything. These tractors are a lot easier to 
operate and they’re comfortable to work in. So that makes a big difference. And picking rock with a skid 
steer versus a stone boat is way better. A skid steer, we got ours air-conditioned. 
VC: So, it used to be that people would, I’m thinking in terms of workforce, people who had limited skills 
could find a job on the farm because they could- 
AG: Oh, pick rocks. Pick em up, put ‘em on a stone boat. A stone boat is just a flat bunch of boards, but 
you take these guys now, you’ve got to be able to run a skid steer. If you see someone that can run a 
skid steer well and think, “Well, that doesn’t look that hard.” Well, get in it and try it, if you’ve never run 
one. Most all the drivers we have here have commercial driver’s licenses. They have to to drive for us. 
Well, take the commercial driver’s license test. If you can’t read—we’ve had people come that were 
working for us that wanted to you know—but they tried taking the CDL test. And the CDL test is pretty 
long and you’ve got to be able to study the book. Well if you can’t read the book and you can’t read the 
questions, you can’t pass the CDL exam. No matter how hard you try. So, you know that’s just the reality 
of it. Because our drivers have to have CDLs to drive them tractor trailers.  
VC: So even the day-to-day, the average worker on a farm, not a manager, needs to have some skills 
that might not have been around. 
AG: Oh, they weren’t around. 
(0:12:50)  
VC: Interesting. As I said, we’re gonna jump around for a few minutes. 
AG: Yup, go ahead. 
VC: So the next question that I had was—I don’t know exactly how to phrase this—what’s the 
production per cow, it’s gonna vary a lot but how does it— 
AG: I was just looking, when you were coming, Varick. We had—we’re averaging about right now—I 
keep track every day. But we’ve been between 89.9 and today we’re at 84, so it depends on the day and 
everything. We’re between 85 and 90 pounds. And we’re, when I first started— 
VC: That’s per day or per milking? 
AG: Per cow per day. So when I first started milking, I looked in this, when I first started on testing, they 
used to publish in the extension news a list of all the cows in the county that were over 100 pounds on 
the previous month’s test date. And there’d be like a page, maybe 40 or 50 cows in the whole county 
that would be over a 100 pounds on that test day. There probably weren’t even that many. Today on 
this herd, even though we’re down little bit today, we have 293 cows over 100 pounds. Today. Well back 
then we’d be lucky if out of a hundred, course we had fewer cows, but out of a hundred cows you might 
have three or four, two or three is you were lucky. 2%. You’ve got, well you figure we’re milking 1,100 so 
we’ve got 20% of the herd, more than 20%, 25% is over a 100 pounds a day. So there’s a huge difference 
and it’s all related to everything we’ve done. The animal’s genetically better, she’s genetically better not 
just to give milk, but her ligaments that hold her udder are better, her feet and legs are better. 
Everything about her is a sturdier cow because you’re picking the best genetics. You’re feeding her 
better. You’re taking care of her health better. She’s better vaccinated, better raised as a calf. Our heifer 
barns now all have the same curtain side walls; we’ve made improvement in those. And we balanced the 
diet for them, just like we do for the cows. And they’re vaccinated right along. So the whole process is 
better for them too. So then the cow that grows up is in better shape. She hadn’t been having them only 
as a calf; she was well-fed all along so she’s reached her potential for growth. The whole process, people 
tend to think of it as what can I do to jump. Well, it isn’t, it’s a long road of processes that culminate in 
better production in the end. You can’t just go in and change- I think of people watching NASCAR and 
they say, “well, they did this with the car.” Well, they do every little things, transmission, engine tires. 
The whole nine—the calf’s better, the heifer’s better, the cow’s better, the feed’s better. Everything. 
We’re putting in more fans to try to get better air flow through the barn for the summer. You add a little 
bit there so that the cows are cooler. And they ask if we shut them off at night. Well you don’t because a 
cow’s big. If she builds some heat in her body during the day, the way you deal with that is you keep the 
fans on at night and you get that heat blowed off the cow at night. And then she’s back down to normal 
temperature and she can eat better, she eats more at night, so you run the fans all the time even if it’s 
forty, fifty degrees on a summer night—or 55, that helps cool her down with the body heat of it. So you 
do that and don’t shut the fans off. And that keeps her cooler. And then reproduction’s better, she eats 
more, she’s healthier, she lays down more. When a cow’s uncomfortable they stand more. And when 
they stand they aren’t ruminating like they should and they aren’t resting. They’re better off laying 
down but when they’re hot they don’t want to lay down. 
(0:17:05) 
VC: You’re sharing a lot of really specific knowledge that you use in order to come up with these 
decisions. Is some of this intuitive or is a lot of this come from the research. 
AG: Oh no. A lot of it comes—you read magazines and articles. Farmers share what they do with other 
farmers. Like we’re gonna put brushes in to clean them off. They like them for one thing, they get their 
back itched. But the other thing it does, it gets rid of all the old hair of so they can get rid of heat better. 
It gets rid of all the dirt on their back and everything so they can shed heat. They just feel better. But if 
you look around, all the farmer’s magazines have all kind of things about how to take care of cows, how 
to design stalls, how to do everything.  
VC: They’ve actually been doing that for a long time, right? 
AG: Oh, yeah. It gets incrementally better all the time. 
VC: I remember even as a—you may have talked about this before, American Agriculturalist and Hoard’s 
Dairyman, those kinds of things came out fifty maybe longer ago than that. 
AG: Hundred years ago. 
VC: And they were showing—wasn’t that one of the reasons for the fair, too? That they showed off new 
improvements? 
AG: Right. 
VC: New inventions. New patents and so forth. The county fairs and state fairs were really— 
AG: The thing that happens now too with these farms, these bigger farms that are around the county is, 
if some company has a new idea, since there’s more cows—they’ll come to one farm because they—like 
before it wouldn’t have made sense to visit a whole bunch of fifty cow farms. They’ll come now and say, 
“we’ve got this idea.”And maybe we won’t buy it or whatever, but at least we get to see all the new 
stuff because if you’re big enough or if some company does sell to you, they can make a big enough sale 
to pay for their costs of their people and everything else. 
VC: Sure. 
AG: And we belong to different things like, the Northeast Dairy Producers Association, lot of farms 
belong too now. We swap ideas, they have a newsletter, they have a person they hire that works on 
different things. So there’s different organizations like that too. There always have been but when you 
have bigger farms, it’s just easier. 
(0:19:18) 
 VC: Right, Right. Good, good. Changing the subject again, a little bit about your business plan for the—
this is something you’ve worked on in a pretty sophisticated way, business plan for the farm now and for 
the future. 
AG: Well, you know one of the things, we’re buying a little more land. And the land that’s left takes quite 
a bit of work. It’s got to be, some of the land we’ve bought has got brush on it. So you can cut brush, put 
in tile drain, and then you got—the way we’ve always done it is we get the land, work on improving it 
and then add cows and do some different things. Because you’ve got to have land to feed them before 
you have the cows. Because there just isn’t a lot of feed available around here to buy. Because 
everybody, most everybody is dairying, so they’re using their own feed. So that’s the way we’ve always 
done it. And then the trouble we’re all running into, all the bigger farms are buying land. We hear of 
farms buying land with 100 acres of white birches. And of clearing all the white birches and stumping it 
all and then tiling it, to get land to grow crops on. And there’s nothing wrong with that, it just takes time 
and money. Because land doesn’t, it just takes time to do that. And land that somebody might have let 
go ten, fifteen years ago because they didn’t have tile, bigger farms will buy it, put tile drain and make 
good land out of it. But it takes time.  
VC: A lot of the land requires tile drainage. 
AG: A lot of it up here. Tile drainage, there’s two things that make cropping here way better. Tile drains 
is the first thing. You can go on a lot of this land and put tile 40 feet, 35-40 feet apart, pretty deep. If the 
tile is four feet in the ground, there’s a gradient of water ‘til the next tile, it’s a pyramid shape. The 
water kinds of goes down, it doesn’t go directly across. Of course it has to flow down so you’ve got the 
tile here, go like this everywhere between the tiles, with the way the water goes away. So you have to 
have the tiles close enough together so you still get drainable in the middles between them enough. And 
it depends on the soil type. So sandy soil you could have them a little further apart and the water will 
flow and it won’t be high. Clay ground you’d have to have them closer together. The other things that’s 
really made a big difference is skid steers to pick rock. Because we have two or three skid steers and a 
rock wagon. 
VC: Skid steer. 
AG: Skid steer, you know like a Bobcat. 
VC: Yup. 
AG: Because you can pick rocks all day in one of those, a guy can. Well if you’re picking by hand, you pick 
four or five hours, you’re pretty well shot. 
VC: That’s right. 
AG: So a lot of this land that was stone here, you can pick with a Bobcat and we can pick and keep ahead 
and plant. So those two things have really helped. The tile drain has been tremendous. Especially you 
get down land closer to the river that’s heavier, needs the drainage. So tile drain has made a big 
difference. 
VC: Now, round here and down around Parishville, Hopkinton, Colton, maybe they’re different from 
each other—stony? 
AG: Stony. There are a lot of stones up in this area. More than—so a lot, like I have friends that have 
farms in Ogdensburg; they don’t have almost no stones. But all that land—some of our land doesn’t 
need tile. But all that land, you get down closer to the river, needs tile. It’s all heavier ground. 
VC: Clay. 
AG: Clay, yup. Siltier loams. But they don’t have stones. 
VC: Ron Baldwin. 
AG: Yup. He does most of the tile. He’s done a lot of tile work for us, Ron has. 
(0:23:20)  
VC: He was a classmate of mine. Okay, good. Are you satisfied with the economic state of the farm? 
Maybe people are never satisfied. 
AG: Well, yes. You know there’s two things going on. My wife commented the other day that my brother 
and I have been able to do this and it’s worked out well for us. Obviously we’re here and things have 
gone well. But the reality is too that there are a lot of other farmers that it didn’t work out well for. And 
a number of them got out of business for economic reasons and farmers love to farm, so they work 
incredibly hard in less than ideal conditions, for not much money. And before they finally were forced by 
economics to leave. So for a lot of people it hasn’t worked out as well. The ones you talk to are the 
survivors that are left that have done all right with it. And so there’s the other side of it there. You can’t 
argue with that at all. And one of the things my parents did for us, and if you go around the county, the 
ones that were thinking years ago, if you had somebody that wanted to come home to the farm, they 
could help you by not going to college and come home. Well, the ones that have made it, generally have 
went to college. Because the ability to work hard is one thing, but you’ve got to be able to manage well 
to make these things go. It’s just the way it is. I remember one time when I was doing an internship for 
Farm Credit when I was in college. And I went to, I was at an office and they had you follow somebody. 
And I went to a dairy princess banquet they had in the county or something going on, I can’t remember 
exactly. I sat at a table with a young man. His father gave him a choice of going to college or if he came 
home to the farm, he would buy him a new Camaro. He gave him the choice of the money. Well, this 
young guy—they had a nice farm. I’d been there as part of this internship with the loan officer. They had 
a nice farm. And of course the young guy took the car and stayed home. And I thought my whole life, I 
remembered that. That was a poor decision. A very poor decision. The father shouldn’t have given him 
the choice of a car or college. He should have said either go to college or don’t come home. No car, no 
nothing. If you want to graduate from high school and you don’t want to go to college, there’s no job for 
you here. And my parents putting us through school was as valuable thing they could have done for the 
long term benefit of the farm. My nephew spent a semester in Europe when he was going to college, 
learned a lot there. Spent a summer, instead of coming home to work he did an internship on another 
large farm. And he learned a lot there. He got to travel around, which at the time we went to college 
they didn’t have all these trips to travel as much as they do. So all that’s valuable stuff. My nephew’s 
girlfriend is finishing her Masters at Cornell in Ag Education. I don’t know if they’ll ever, how that’ll work 
out, but she’s doing an internship with Extension up here this summer and gonna live with my niece. 
And that’s all good stuff to bring home. Because the education and management is the more important. 
You gotta work hard too. But you can lose a lot more money with poor management that you can make 
up with hard work. Let’s put it that way. 
VC: That’s a very good quotable quote. 
AG: Well it’s the truth! You cannot work hard enough to make up for poor management. No matter how 
hard, you can work 24 hours a day at one of these things. You just cannot do it. And the other thing 
that’s helped me a lot is being involved in ag organizations. I just finished, I’m a Certified Corporate 
Director now. 
VC: Last time I was here that was about to happen. 
AG: Yup. And so I got my certificate. That training, Farm Credit trains board members exceptionally well. 
I put a plug in for Farm Credit of course, because I’m on the board, but you know we get training all over 
the country. We meet with other farmers or other directors that are in the same training. Because we 
don’t just have it all just for our organization because we want the cross pollination between directors 
of different organizations. You know if I wasn’t, if you’re running a farm there’s so much to do, would 
you pay—it would cost a lot of money to get that. They probably spent a hundred thousand to get us 
trained through this one program. At least. Would I spend that kind of money on myself? Maybe I’d 
think about the money, but then the time, too. To go to these different sessions. And you would have to 
figure out how to get the right people together to pay for it, to do that. So I have been fortunate, being 
on the Board, I’ve learned a lot by those kinds of training things. So that helps too. It all helps. 
(0:28:45)  
VC: Great. Good.  You said something before about a national trend to get bigger versus everything 
we’ve done to say in business. Have any more thoughts on the need to expand? 
AG: Well, you know what drives it is the fact of the technology, ‘cause technology—everything is a 
double edged sword. The technology’s great, but it costs money. You know this Feedwatch program you 
know is several thousand dollars. Every year we use the Dairy Comp that’s running right now, but it isn’t 
like you buy the Dairy Comp program and you just use it. They license it to you for a year. So every year 
you have to pay for the license. And they make improvements to it; it’s a great program. But it’s like the 
GPS stuff; it saves time and money, and I’ll give you an example. They have corn planters now that can 
turn off every row. So when you come to the field that has a point or corner, when you get to where you 
are, the GPS knows and it shuts the rows off so you don’t double plant. Well, there’s a farm, Marks 
Farm, that put it in in Lowville and they saved two whole pallets of seed. And seed is like $300 a bag. So 
you’re talking, they saved $25,000 dollars worth of seed by having this technology to turn off. Well if 
you’ve only got 80 or 100 acres of corn, you cannot afford the technology to save yourself. Because the 
technology is so expensive, you don’t save any money. Where you save the money is by being big 
enough to have enough acres so that once you pay for the technology, you can spread it over a lot of 
acres. It’s like if you had 100 cows in our parlor, to protect milk weights and all that, you can’t afford the 
parlor for 100 cows. So you’re bigger. If you have a 12 row corn planter, you can plant a lot of corn; but 
if you’ve only got 50 acres, you can’t afford the technology in the planter. Technology drives it and 
technology allows farms to be bigger, just like computers. So the two things work together. And the 
other thing that happens, and I think it’s as important as anything, is the lifestyle thing. If someone really 
wants to have 70 or 80 cows as a family; you could do it. But you’d never get any time off. And you could 
manage, you could hire your neighbors to put corn in for you and you could do all that; but even my 
employees used to be people that worked on farms, they worked seven days a week. Well, nobody’s 
raised that way today. They just, nobody will do it. It’s like somebody asked me, I work six days a week, 
that’s a lot. I said, “Well, no, I’m pretty happy because when I started here I was working seven days a 
week.” So, I get a day off a week and it’s way better! Well, people now, five days a week, maybe six. 
VC: And forty hours. 
AG: Well, 40, 50 hours, that’s about it. That’s just the way people are raised. You can’t go against that; 
you can’t make it. These guys work, they’re great, they’ll help out if somebody’s family member passed 
away, they work an extra day and all that kind of stuff. But to do it every day, people aren’t going to do 
that. Not in this society. 
(00:32:33) 
 VC: So in other words, it has crossed your mind to expand? 
AG: From here? We always think about it. You look around and the problem we have right here is you’ve 
got to take care of this manure. And of course there’s a lot of water in it. So you’ve got to haul it away. 
So the further away you haul it, you get to a point where it just doesn’t work. And so maybe there’s a 
limit on how many cows you can have at this location. And the other thing we were talking about the 
other day. I’m gonna be 55 this summer. You run out of time to do it, so somebody else has to do it. You 
just run out of time to do—it’s running along great but you run out of time. I can remember my 
grandfather telling my father, “Well, someday you’ll be my age and you won’t feel like doing as much.” 
Well, you don’t, that’s just the reality. But we’ll just have to see how it goes. And you can expand other 
ways. We’re growing a little more grain so we don’t have to buy as much. And haul our own milk. So 
there’s other things you can do. But there’s a limit in a particular area because—particularly on a cattle 
farm. You’ve got to do something with the manure. You’ve got to haul it, put it where it needs to go.  
VC: The thing with manure, that can be controversial, right? 
SAG: Oh yeah.  
VC: Spreading the manure, the lagoon, all that. Do you have a lagoon? 
AG: Yes.  
VC: Then especially when you come to a little denser population and so forth. 
AG: Well, we’re lucky here because there are not too many people around us. And we were fortunate. 
My father bought the land around the farm. And we never sold lots or anything like that. So we don’t 
have very many houses. You drove by; you know there’s not too many. And it’s interesting, people’s 
attitude about it. Because if you ask them if they believe in recycling and reuse, they’re all for all that. 
But manure, it’s the ultimate recycling thing. You know the other thing that’s very interesting is people’s 
thought about what happened years ago versus the way things are done today. If you look at- we do 
very detailed maps- 
VC: You’re getting a fax. 
AG: No, it prints off the parlor report. At 10:30 and 2:30 in the morning and at 6 at night. 
VC: Really? 
AG: It automatically prints the parlor report. But if you look at these—we do very detailed maps of all 
the land we have. And we do very detailed soil sampling of all the fields. If you take a look at all the 
places where there was a small barn- what we call Cali farm any of these places that had a small farm 
with a small barn. Even though the barn is gone, maybe or hasn’t had cattle in it for years, right around 
that barn it’s very high in nutrients. Because those farmers fifty years ago, when they were spreading 
manure in the winter, they didn’t get very far before they spread the manure. Or they’d haul it out with 
something and spread it right around the barn. We do a much better job of moving nutrients to far 
fields, to spreading it out evenly, than they do. But the perception of course is that these big farms do a 
worse job. But if you look at these maps, they are color coded. So around these old barns it’s almost 
black, because of the high concentration of phosphorous. Well, it’s because they went right out there in 
the winter in an open cab tractor or horses or whatever and they spread the manure right there. Just 
got it out of the barn and got in on the land right around the barn. And so really, in many ways- it’s just 
we’re so big if anything does happen it’s more of an issue. But a lot of farms spread manure out. We 
haul it everywhere; we spread it out over all the fields. Those guys didn’t get very far from the barn 
before they spread. 
VC: Well, the odor issue for some— 
AG: The odor issue because people—and here’s another interesting thing. Because when people fifty 
years ago they all grew up on farms, mostly. There was odor issues then, they were just used to it 
because they grew up with it as a kid and it didn’t bother them. Now people don’t have any contact with 
any kind of odor issues; and so when they get out and they get an odor—and it’s interesting too because 
there’s been a lot of research done on—this may not seem related in a way, but on-farm kids don’t have 
the asthma and auto-immune issues that other people have. If you read quite a bit, you ever read those 
articles where they’ve just done studies on kids growing up in the suburbs, they’re not exposed to 
anything, their immune system isn’t challenged in any way, they have a lot more auto-immune diseases 
and all that. Well, being out in the country on a farm, you get the benefit of all that. You wonder if 
people are just more sensitive to any kind of odor or dirt. If both people followed me around, I’ll come 
home at night and there will be manure on my forehead and my wife will say to me, “You’ve got manure 
on your forehead.” And I’ll say, “Well, I thought I got it cleaned off, I got no mirror here.” Most people if 
they got that dirty, they’d go wild. Most people, the way we’re raised today a little manure on you—
we’re in it all the time. 
VC: Well, actually as you were describing that scenario, it seemed to me it’s like cigarette smoke. You 
know, I grew up with cigarette smoke and I never thought about it. And now if I smell cigarette smoke I 
can detect it. 
AG: Oh, I know it! If you go to a hotel room that was for a smoker and you have to get one, it just reeks. 
Or smell somebody, come up near somebody in church that smokes. But years ago my grandfather, 
everybody smoked in the house, you smoked everywhere. And so it’s the same sort of thing. And we try 
to work the manure in as quick as we can to save the nutrients too. The funny thing is, the runoff is bad 
for you, the odor—I don’t know as if the odor is going to do much damage. There’s worse things about 
it. 
(phone rings) 
VC: Sure, take that. 
AG: Hello. Good, Matt. Listen, I got a guy here with me. Are you busy today, can I call you back? Okay, 
thanks Matt. Yup, bye. My vice chairman. 
VC: Oh. 
AG: Yeah. 
(0:39:28) 
 VC: What has kept you in business when others haven’t made it? 
AG: Well, we work together, all of us as a family. My parents and everything. We had the advantage of 
good education, that helps a lot. You know we like the lifestyle of doing this. There is a lifestyle part to it 
because running any business like this is 24/7. If you really want to be able to get away on the weekend 
or get away and not have anybody bother you, this probably isn’t the job for you. Because things just 
happen. The middle of the night things happen. Yesterday the guys were hanging fans and they had a lift 
in the middle alleyway where the cows’ feed is. And this cow got up on the curb with her feet and she 
was reaching out to lick that and she got herself over the bar. So she’s hung up half over the bar with 
her feet in the feed and the back feet in the alley. So I had to come around with the skid steer, put it 
under the front of her and pick her up to back her up to get her out of there. Well, cows just do stuff and 
things just happen. So I think, we had the benefit of good education. Maybe we had opportunities. It 
depends in a given area if we happened to be younger at the time where we farmers are selling out. 
There were a number around here where they got older and nobody in the family—we had neighbors 
up here that never got married and they had a small farm. When they quit we were able to rent their 
farm. You know, just things. Sometime you just wonder if you’re in the right place at the right time. And 
we like this and seem to have somewhat of an aptitude for it. So that helps too. Lots of good things 
happen, I guess. Maybe we just don’t mind owing money and you know borrowing money— 
(Varick laughs) 
AG:-There’s some factor to that. There’s a lot of risk in this business and all the bigger farms I know owe 
substantial debt. So you’ve got to have a little bit of willingness to do that, otherwise you never—You 
can’t even save enough money. If you’ve got 100 cows and want to save enough money to have enough 
money to save to go to 200, you’d never get there. But you get that other 100 cows by owing the money 
and they help pay the debt. So there’s some of that too. Willing to take the risk of doing it. 
VC: Si Eakins told me many many years ago, I remember his coming into my dad’s store, maybe I told 
you. And the other men, they were all sitting around the store, everybody had their opinion of course. 
And they were all on his case, he was young. They were on his case about how big he was getting and 
how much money he must owe, the whole deal about—they were minding his business, small town 
people sometimes do. 
AG: Oh yeah.  
VC: So I remember his saying the bank owned the farm. It was the only way he could do it. That’s why he 
didn’t lie white lies because he said there was no way— 
AG: He’s just running it for ‘em, that’s what Si would say. Yeah, he gave me my high school diploma. 
VC: Is that right? 
AG: Yeah. And you have to have good relations with your lender because when you owe the kind of 
money we all owe, they are kind of your quasi partner in this business. But it just worked out well for 
those of us. If you hate owing money and it really bothers you, this is not the job for you either.   
(0:43:15) 
 VC: This is not a natural follow up question to that, but it’s another question. What do you and Tony’s 
wife do on the farm? Do they do anything farm related?  
AG: Well, my wife does truck registrations. She’s helping right now with her mother and my mother a 
little but not as much as mine but mostly with hers, her mother’s  a widow. Mary Ann works at Clarkson 
and she does all the book work for—we have a gravel pit, so Mary Ann does all that.  
VC: And that’s Tony’s wife.  
AG: Tony’s wife. And then, my wife and I have got four children and of course I’ve been doing off-farm 
co-op stuff for years. And so I’m gone quite a bit. So she would have been like a single mom in some 
ways. Somebody said- this isn’t bad or good, or maybe it’s bad- I’ve never been to a doctor’s 
appointment for one of the kids. And my mother-in-law babysits. When they were young, Mary would 
take them. So partly the farm, she just did it. And that’s the way it is. 
VC: You had to be working— 
AG: It isn’t, to do the amount of work there is around here, it’s just the way it is. I go to the concerts and 
all that, but my wife does it for our kids and for Tony’s kids. 
VC: It used to be that small farmers, quite a few that I know, their wives were teachers. Obviously 
supplemented the family income. 
AG: And had health insurance. 
VC: Yeah, exactly. All those kinds of things. Has either of your wives, does that have an impact on— 
AG: Not the size, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference. The income. Let’s say at this size we’re at, if your 
wife was the CEO of IBM or something, but if you’re making a regular income, let’s say a teacher’s 
income of $50,000 a year. You know, we gross $600 or 700,000 a month, somewhere in there. So you’d 
have a really had time, that $50,000 is not going to save you. If you had a 40 or 50 count farm, the 
health insurance and everything makes a big difference. But we run this place poorly, it’s not going to 
make any difference what the girls make. 
VC: That was my question. So they do it for their own satisfaction? 
AG: Oh, yeah or whatever. Or they’re just not farmers. 
(0:46:12) 
 VC: Thoughts, maybe we’ve talked about this a little bit before. Thoughts about some of the labor 
situation. I know we’ve gone into some length about how you’ve hired local guys. Any particular thing 
about—maybe I should do this question. Your thoughts on immigrant labor? 
AG: Well, one of the things that’s happened in this area, and I see it because I get to travel some. And 
it’s discouraging in a way, living here and loving Northern New York. But the reality of where we live is, 
this is an exceptionally poor area. Very limited employment opportunities for people. In a way you could 
say it’s almost poverty-stricken, how this whole area is. And it really is.  
VC: And it’s sad too, but I agree with you 100%. 
AG: Yeah, it is. You look around, as you know I’ve spent quite a bit of time in Washington, DC and that 
area. And I’ve spent time other places. It’s really sad because I love this area. And there are a lot of good 
people that love living here. And so I think that helps. And plus the living costs are lower. Low house 
prices and everything. So we’re able to have people work here that we can pay and they can make a 
decent living working for us. Where if you were living in Maryland or even Rochester, you couldn’t 
afford a house. So that helps to some extent. People choose living here and they like being closer to 
home.  They’re going to school; a lot of the people working for me have gone to school with my kids so I 
like having local people work for us.  
VC: That’s a very interesting point. I think you do a real service actually.  
AG: Well, it’s hard because it’s a full-time—and Hispanic workers are great. (phone ringing) Hello. What? 
You know where the choke is, Chris? Push—all the way down is the choke. And it won’t run? Well, either 
that or just work it. I’ll be down in a few minutes and I’ll start it for you, when I’m done here. Okay, 
thanks. 
VC: I don’t have a lot more. 
AG: Okay.  
(0:48:54) 
 VC: What’s the most challenging part of dairy farming? 
AG: Well you know the weather is always an interesting thing. That’s something we can’t do anything 
about. So I don’t consider that a challenge because you just kind of work around that. You know having 
all the people. It’s not that’s it’s bad or good it’s just that when you have so many people working, 
there’s all the personalities just like any business, how everybody gets along and works together. To get 
everything done. The most challenging thing is that it’s 24/7. And you’ve got to do the same thing every 
day and you’ve got to do it EVERY day. I’m sure somebody, I hate to pick on cabinetmakers, but I’m 
looking at the cabinet on the wall, you’re getting so many cabinets out a week and you have a problem 
today and you’re one short, you can add a person and gain one tomorrow. Well we’ve got to feed them 
and milk them exactly the same every day. So you can’t say, “Well, we won’t feed these cows today, 
we’ll just wait and feed them twice tomorrow.” That makes a big difference. If a cow has an issue, where 
she’s sick or whatever, we’ve got to deal with it right now. And so that’s the part of it—I have friends 
that are farmers that do other, grain farmers or whatever and a lot of them wouldn’t dairy. Too much 
every day. The same thing has to happen. You don’t get a break from it. If you’re growing grain, you 
don‘t need to work on Christmas. So that’s the challenging part of being a dairyman, it’s so steady. It’s 
every single day. 
(00:50:40) 
 VC: Yes, I can certainly see that. What’s the most satisfying or enjoyable part of dairy farming for you? 
AG: Well, my vet and I had a herd check yesterday in one of the paddocks. Just got to love cows. It’s like 
I told you about the cow, she was reaching for the thing. He was telling me he was doing an operation at 
a farm and he put his box, they had a box stall next to it and the heifers could reach through the pen. He 
put the box just so they couldn’t reach it. He said they spent the whole time trying to reach through the 
bars and lick his box. And one of them finally touched it with her tongue, shut the cover on it, and they 
all jumped back. Well, you gotta like cows. They’re friendly. I was out working on a broken stall, you 
can’t leave anything. I had my truck right there with the stuff in it. I ran out a cord so I could run the drill 
and I run out to get something and I mean as soon as I leave and there was only five, ten feet, they’d run 
right around the corner to lick the drill and see what’s going on. So, I like the cows. And then the 
satisfaction of building a business and having it look decent. It’s a lot of fun too. And you know, Varick, I 
like, love living in Northern New York. With the skills I’ve had, I’ve the opportunity to run a pension fund, 
I’ve had the opportunity to learn some other stuff, that’s the kind of job I’d had. But I wouldn’t have 
been here. I would have been—you’d have been in a city somewhere. You’d have been in Boston or 
New York or Washington and I could have made a career doing that and liked it. I like the opportunity, 
but I love living here. I don’t mind visiting cities; I wouldn’t want to live there. A farm’s a great place to 
have a family. And Northern New York is a great place. 
(00:52:42) 
 VC: You have hobbies? 
AG: I play golf a little bit. Mainly my hobby is doing the Board stuff. Because it takes a lot of my time and 
I like it. It’s a different mental challenge. I was on a Trust Committee. Well, I ran one and then I just got 
off one I was on for six years. ‘Cause my hobbies are like Sudoku, crossword puzzles and stuff like that. 
VC: You don’t hunt, fish. 
AG: Oh no. 
VC: Did your dad? 
AG: Yeah! My father loved to hunt. It’s all he did for hobby. I hunted with him because he always did it. 
My brother loved to hunt. I like my meat in a store. I don’t want to have to gut it and clean it and cook it, 
or cut it up and all that kind of stuff. I wouldn’t mind if I had time I wouldn’t mind fishing. It’s like playing 
golf. I love to play golf. I’ve never taken lessons, but I’m not a bad golfer at all. And I’ve gotten to play. 
I’ve played Pebble Beach a couple times and I’ve played in Broodmare Colorado. ‘Cause I have meetings 
places. And I play pretty decent. I shoot around 100 on those kind of courses which if you’ve ever played 
is pretty good. If I didn’t have anything else to do I could play every day, I wouldn’t like it. I like doing this 
and the Farm Credit stuff is very interesting because the bank’s almost five billion dollars. Getting to be 
the Chair of that Board’s been a lot of fun because you get to be working with the people and see how 
the people work together. People to me, the biggest fun thing for me in a way is watching people and 
working with them. Because the most fascinating thing going in our life is people. It really is; it’s the 
most fascinating thing going. Human beings are incredibly interesting, maybe not happy, or frustrating, 
but incredible interesting, human beings.  
VC: This is off topic, but I just lately, I don’t know if you’ve ever paid any attention to Jonathan Winters 
the comic. He used to be on television frequently. He just died, so there’s been some talk about—he 
was a genius at creating characters. He was obviously a great observer of people to do that. And I don’t 
have that talent but I’ve just always found it interesting, people are so interesting. 
AG: And that’s the thing about—I don’t have language skills. This is back to the labor thing. The Hispanic 
workers are good workers and there’s no issue with that. But I like talking to the people that work with 
me and interacting and getting to know them. I just like the people aspect of all this. We had, my CEO of 
the company on the Board said he doesn’t have to worry about sending me anywhere because I’ll visit 
with the people. Just people really, Varick, they are, human beings are the most interesting, we’re an 
interesting creation. 
VC: Species. 
AG: To put it mildly. 
VC: Just to go back for a moment, something you were talking about the cows and how they would 
follow around, follow around. Cows are curious right? It always occurred to me that like when they’re 
out in the field, they’re always watching. Very curious. 
AG: They have very much personalities; they’re all different, just like people. People look, who don’t 
know cows, they say oh there’s a cow. But they’re all different. Some of them never some up, others are 
right there. And they generally are just all different. 
(00:57:00) 
 VC: Speaking of that. There was a question that Hannah wanted to ask you. When did you stop 
pasturing? Early on? 
AG: Yeah. Well, we pastured heifers for a while. Oh it was at least 15-20 years ago.  
VC: And that’s important? That you not pasture? 
AG: Well, the trouble with the number we have now, we just have mud most of the time. And then they 
waste a lot of feed when they’re on pasture. And you can do it right. There’s people that rotationally 
graze and everything and it works out fine. But this number is hard to rotationally graze. Our land is so 
spread out too, you couldn’t haul the animals to it. So we haul the feed to them. Plus the other thing, we 
can make them more comfortable in the barn, especially in the summer with fans and sprinklers and all 
that. ‘Cause if you ever go by in the heat of the summer a bunch of cows on pasture, they are all 
standing together under one tree. So they’re in the slop and the muck and the flies are all concentrated 
there and they’re not eating anything and they’re not drinking anything and they’re just all hot together. 
I never figured out with cows, they are plain stupid though because why not spread out in the pasture 
under a bunch of trees to get the shade. It’s a herd thing; they’re a herd animal. So they all herd right 
together, even if they’re dying in the heat. 
VC: Couple more. How do you see the role of the farm and the dairy farm in particular, in the broader 
community in Northern New York. What’s its role? 
AG: Well, in Northern New York dairy farms are economic engines. Because you look at not only the 
number of people we employ but directly, then you have the people that deliver feed, even the local 
hardware stores and local businesses that we all buy from. There’s a lot of economic activity gained by 
farmers. We spend all the money we get. We spend a tremendous amount of money in local taxes; a lot 
of time farmers are on school boards or on the County Legislation, they have natural budgeting skills 
that quite frankly a lot of people that don’t run their own businesses don’t have. So there’s a lot of 
benefits to having vibrant agriculture, economic benefits. Besides the community benefits of having 
people on boards and understanding what it is to run a business and have a budget and all that. We 
seem to have lost it because you look at some of these budgets around the North Country and people 
just don’t understand. There’s not unlimited money and you’ve got to have some kind of economies of 
scale, you’ve got terrible fixed cost problems in our schools, ‘cause most of your cost of school is fixed 
costs of teachers and buildings and stuff. And if you have fewer kids and the state aid is based on per 
pupil, you can’t afford to lose too many kids before you really run into a terrible fixed cost. 
(1:00:16)  
VC: Are there farms around here or even beyond that you particularly admire? 
AG: Oh, there’s a lot of good farm operations. You know we have in the county, John Greenwood does a 
tremendous job, Dick Eakins—Dick can grow corn, Stauffers, just locally, the ones right close by. 
Stauffers have done a great job. There’s a lot of them around. The ones that have left, they’ve done a 
really good job. They improved land, they’ve tiled, they’ve run good businesses and done other things. 
Kevin Acres is on the County Legislature and I agree with Kevin’s stance on things so that kind of helps 
too. 
VC: You do, you say. 
AG: I do. And Kevin’s given that and that takes a lot of time, you know. And he gets a lot of flak for that. 
So there are a lot of good ones. 
(1:01:25) 
 VC: This question just occurred to me. Looking back over years past and before a lot of the major 
changes occurred, do you think the farmers and farms that, when they were still small that were good 
farmers, like your dad would have admired. Like before there were still good farmers around... 
AG: Oh, there were a lot of good farmers around. And the changes, you know people tend to want to 
pick a time that things changed. But things evolved. It isn’t like you come to a point and all the sudden 
everything changes. 
VC: Sure. 
AG: There’s always various stages of evolution in these businesses. And there were a lot of good farms 
around. You mentioned, Si Eakins did a good job back then. Different people at different times and the 
stage of the business, and they raised families and they made a living. 
VC: I remember people used to talk, was it Scott Cook? 
AG: Oh, Conrad’s father did a good job, too. I knew Scott just when he was just a much older man. He 
was retiring. But there again, his wife taught school and Scott did a great job, he had a beautiful herd of 
Guernseys. And it’s just like, people don’t think of it but there’s a Jersey farm in Canton. 
VC: Oh Sheesley’s. 
AH: Sheesley’s. They’ve got a tremendous herd of Jerseys. They’ve got one of the best Jersey show cows 
in the country. Right in Canton, right in the village, almost. I think they are in the village. 
VC: I think they are. 
AG: They do a good job. And theirs, it’s not related, it’s just economies of scale. What’s happened is, 
your cost of production has to be low enough and the only way—it’s hard to get it if you’ve got a small 
farm. 
VC: He’s quite specialized, right? 
AG: Oh yeah. They do Jerseys and they’ve got off-farm jobs. And they show. 
VC: Breeding. 
AG: They’ve got tremendous show cows and tremendous genetics. 
(1:03:40)  
VC: This may sound like a really weird question, but we’ve run into this, so that’s probably why I wanted 
to ask you. Are you religious and does this play a role in your choice to farm? 
AG: Well, the religious part, yeah I’m religious. Went to Catholic schools. Somebody I was picking on, 
they didn’t know, somebody came to I remember they were Mormon or whatever—to convert you, I 
was kind of picking on them a little that day, so they were saying something and I said, “Say, I don’t 
know about that, but really you ought to think about becoming Catholic.” I said “I’ve been Catholic my 
whole life, born Catholic and plan on dying Catholic, but I think you really ought to think about 
converting to be Catholic, because Catholics came before Mormons.” And they left! (Both laugh) They 
didn’t stay and visit with me! And so I don’t think it has anything to do with whether I became a farmer 
or not, but I think it does color my view. Because this new Pope we got. This Jesuit. Very interested in 
working with people that need help and it does color my view about believing in the local community. 
Wanting to hire people to live here and kids go to school with my kids or went to school. And that kind 
of thing colors my view. If you believe in your religion at all, I just love the idea that this new Pope is a 
Jesuit. I think that, his view on religion should be there to help the less fortunate. That should be the 
first thing. Mother Theresa, the Jesuits always view you work in the poorest neighborhoods. If you 
believe in religion at all, God created all of us. And so we’re all equal in God’s eyes. You just do the best 
you can to help the most you possibly can, recognizing there is limits to what we can do as humans. You 
want to try the best you can. 
VC: That’s all very helpful and interesting. It’s been our observation that some people that are farming, 
it’s almost like a religious experience for them, in the sense of the closeness of the land and all of that. 
The Amish particularly. 
AG: Oh yeah, of course. 
VC: I’ve noticed there will be farms around that quite often, occasionally you’d see one that has religious 
symbols in the yard or they call it God’s whatever. 
AG: I’ve seen them. There’s one on 11. Outside of Gouverneur. You know the interesting thing is that it’s 
hard to be here every day and see stuff growing and the animals and all that and not believe that 
somebody created this, created us. Maybe that’s why farmers are more religious, I don’t know if they 
are. I tend to think they are. It’s kind of hard, if you’re not out in nature and as close to it, you can kind 
of get the view that you control things and out here you’ve got the weather. Somebody else is 
controlling something, Varick! It certainly isn’t me! (both laugh) I’m just trying to deal with what comes 
down the pike. It’s hard not to be here and not see, like in the spring, this is a great time. Stuff growing, I 
just love to see when the corn gets up.  
VC: Spring is my favorite season. And the problem for us is it’s so short. 
AG: Well, it is but you see it and you know—even animals giving birth, as much as I see it, it’s a miracle 
when things are born. That’s just the way it is. In my mind, it’s a miracle of birth; it’s tremendous even at 
my age. The number of cows I’ve seen calve. It happens here every day. But it’s amazing. Everything 
works generally, so I kind of have a hard time not believing. 
(1:08:10)  
VC: One last question.  What are you most proud about? 
AG: Well, my kids, actually. I love the farm and I’m happy with that. But your family, my mother and I 
were talking about this—my family, all of them, my mother and brother, everybody, it’s your family, 
what you have or don’t have at the end of the day, is your family. ‘Cause businesses come and go. 
Things can happen; you never know what’s going to happen. You could grow up and lose the ability to 
get up every day and do what you’re doing. But you’ve got your family. That’s the thing to me that’s the 
most important thing going. It works out nice. Mary and I are both Northern New York people, her 
mother is now a mile from us. She moved closer than she was, so we’ve got all of them around. Yup, 
that’s the most important. 
VC: And what are you most proud of about the whole farm operation? 
AG: Well, I like the way it looks. Being able to be here and stay doing it is, I’m happy with that. And I do 
love the way it looks. I think it’s important, people say there’s vanity in there, it’s not, if you take pride in 
something you want to have it look decent. And you want to have people that drive by, have a good 
view of your industry. I’m more worried on that than anything, because when you put your life’s work 
into something, you want to have the general public be appreciative of agriculture. And I think that 
generally, as we get further along in time, our general population doesn’t have, isn’t as appreciative of 
American agriculture as it used to be. Because other places in the world don’t have what we have in 
terms of productivity of agriculture and the base of our economy. Because when you can feed the 
people you have with the number we have, it frees up people to do other things. 
VC: It is part of the culture though. I spent some time—I’m going to turn this off, this isn’t relevant—
