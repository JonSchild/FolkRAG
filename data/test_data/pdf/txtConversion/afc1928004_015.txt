SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO, WHEN YOU'VE 
MONEY. 
BY H. ANGELO. 
Air — Kate Kearney. 
A BLESSING it is to have money— 
'Twill oft prove a 
friend and a 
crony— 
Your wants ' twill supply, 
The world you can buy, 
That's if you've enough of the money;

Of nonsense you're constantly dreaming, 
While cash from your pockets is streaming; 
In a 
palace you'll dwell, 
There, cut a 
great swell, 
That's if you are blessed with the money. 
See what you can do when you've money— 
Your friend, your companion, and crony— 
The ladies all sigh, 
And after you cry, 
It's not for yourself, but your money; 
You've friends in abundance to greet you, 
It's " How do you do ?" when they meet you; 
" 
Please lend me a 
ten, 
I'll pay you again," 
And there's an end of that money. 
See what you can do when you've money— 
Your name without '
Squire looks funny— 
No fear of the law, 
Make use of your jaw, 
'Twill clear you of trouble—will money; 
For office of course you're perfection, 
Your name has great weight at election, 
You'll have it your way, 
And carry the day, 
Provided you're blessed with the money. 
See what you can do when you've money— 
Your friend, I 
repeat, and old crony— 
'Tis lasted awhile, 
And ' way goes your pile— 
Your downfall, perhaps, was your money; 
At races and cards you've been simple, 
Drank rum— till your nose—there's a 
pimple— 
Some prison or jail, 
No friend to go bail, 
You wish once again to have money. 
UNDER YOUR NOSE. 
117 H. ANGELO. 
Air—Derry Down. 
MANY queer subjects pop into my mind, 
Many queer songs have I 
sung of mankind; 
To sing you another, my friends, I 
propose, 
Concerning of matters right under my nose. 
'Tis a 
fact, yes, yes, ' tis a 
fact. 
In a 
fashionable street, with a 
charming young 
maid, 
Together you're walking the gay promenade; 
Your tailor accosts you, and makes an expose, 
By poking a 
tong bill right under your nose. 
'Tis a 
fact, &c., & c. 
Invite your best friends at your mansion to dine, 
Introduced to your wife, he declares her divine; 
Beside her at dinner a 
seat he has chose, 
And ten to one but he's kissed her right under 
your nose. 
'Tis a 
fact, & c., & c. 
If you've got a 
few dollars you'd like to put out, 
Your pile, a 
small interest will swell it no doubt; 
All the saving funds offer, you'll get, I 
suppose, 
But if you are wise, keep it under your nose. 
'Tis a 
fact, &c., &c. 
The doctor, the lawyer, the tradesman, and all 
Will take the advantage, no matter how small; 
Your eyes are your market, if you let ' em impose, 
They'll stick you like forty, right under your nose. 
'Tis a 
fact, &c., & c.

ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS. 
Now- a- days you can't trust either woman or man, 
Deception and humbug now's every one's plan; 
Foes may be friends, or friends be your foes, 
But you're sure of nobody, though under your nose. 
'Tis a 
fact, & c., & c. 
MY WIFE. 
BY H. ANGELO. 
Air—Mrs. Johnson. 
OF 
all the women in this town, 
That I 
have seen since I've been round, 
There's one I 
think can take ' em down— 
(Spoken.) 
That's my wife. 
Whenever I 
goes home at night, 
With me she's sure to pick a 
fight, 
Then I 
gets bang'd both left and right_ 
(Spoken.) 
By my wife. 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS.

What right has my wife to sit up at nights, burn-
ing candles at my expense; yes, and what right 
has she to go to bed when she knows I'm out— 
that's the question. 
(Sung.) 
For Mrs. A., my wife, sirs. 
All kinds of work she makes me do, 
Wash all her clothes, and dishes too; 
Sometimes I 
catch it with her shoe— 
(Spoken.) 
By my wife. 
There was a 
time she called me dear, 
But now behaves so very queer; 
Now, who d'ye think drinks lager beer ? 
(Spoken) 
My wife. 
What right has my wife to drink lager beer, 
injuring her constitution, when she knows it's 
against the rules and regulations of our tee-to-tal 
society ?—that's the question. 
(Sung.) 
For Mrs. A., my wife, sirs. 
Her tongue keeps going click, click, clack, 
And when I 
goes to sass her back, 
Across my mouth I 
gets a 
smack— 
(Spoken.) 
From my wife. 
Talk of accidents the papers may, 
Of steamboats blowing folks away, 
Why, I 
gets blowed up every day— 
(Spoken.) 
By my wife. 
What right has she to blow me up—me, her lord 
and master ? 
What's more, when she knows Pm 
a 
superior officer—that's another question 
(Sung.) 
For Mrs. A., my wife, sirs. 
Our party they are fully bent, 
To Washington I 
shall be sent, 
But I've been under government— 
(Spoken.) 
Of my wife. 
Political meetings I 
attends, 
For there I'm sure to meet my friends, 
46.1140Aivraiiiiiktir 
II 
10 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS. 
But some one always for me sends— 
(Spoken.) 
That's my wife. 
What right has my wife to interfere in politics, 
when she knows a 
woman ain't allowed to vote 
until they pass a 
woman's rights' law; and that 
won't be till the year nineteen hundred and ninety-
nine—that's another question 
For Mrs. A., my wife, sirs. 
Whenever I 
goes to take a 
drink, 
Or treat a 
friend—now what do you think ? 
Some one is sure to steal the chink— 
That's my wife. 
She calls me horrid names all day, 
With her no longer I 
can stay; 
I 
believe my soul I'll run away— 
(Spoken.) 
From my wife. 
What right has my wife to call me Bill, when 
my name's William ? 
She says I 
ain't a 
good Bill, 
either—won't pass—a 
tavern—without going in. 
I 
don't know what bank I'm on—last Sunday, I 
was on the Schuylkill Bank—drunk. 
I'd better 
leave this—perhaps somebody might come along 
that looks like 
Mrs. A., my wife, sirs. 
GOOD AND BAD TIMES. 
Sr H. ANGELO. 
Air—Sprig of Shillela. 
Or good and bad times, I 
will sing hit or miss, 
As experience has taught me enough of such bliss, 
Concerning the changes in times good or bad. 
There once was a 
time when a 
fellow could go, 
And get a 
good toddy, for a 
three-pence or so; 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS.

But these monstrous big houses, rot pay such big 
rents, 
If you take but a 
swallow, they'll charge you ten 
cents. 
Now arn't it ridiclous, these very hard times ? 
There once was a 
time, but that time has gone by, 
When silver and gold all our wants would supply; 
But we scarcely get either these very hard 
times. 
If we'd read in the papers for the lost and the 
found, 
We'd hardly take trouble to go hunting around; 
'Though perhaps in our rambles find a 
pocket-book 
full, 
But now nothing's lost ' cause the times are so dull. 
That's a 
vast difference ' tween good and bad 
times. 
There once was a 
time when our ladies and gents, 
Wore diamonds and jewels—not minding expense; 
But pride must come down these very hard 
times. 
Although to keep up this same fashion of old, 
They've a 
good imitation of silver and gold, 
Dangling on dresses of broadcloth and silk, 
Though forced to drink coffee without sugar or 
milk. 
Arn't that an idea in such awful hard times ? 
There once was a 
time politicians were rare, 
And to seek for an office, honest men wouldn't 
care; 
But oh, what a 
change we have had in the 
times! 
Now, it takes dollars to buy these fat jobs, 
And ccnventions are ruled by political mobs; 
Candidates in abundance to accomplish their ends, 
Blow their own horns, and soap up their friends. 
That's another idea, these very hard times. 
11. 
12 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS. 
There once was a 
time, when a 
man was content, 
And could borrow a 
dollar, though he hadn't a 
cent; 
That was some consolation before we'd hard 
times. 
But now, if by chance your cash is played out, 
Your silver- spoons, and so forth, soon goes up the 
spout; 
To please a 
few friends, you had promised to go 
And o'er a 
few bottles spend an hour or so, 
'Till your mind has been freed from the 
thoughts of hard times. 
There once was a 
time, and we have it here now, 
And before I 
conclude, I 
beg you'll allow 
A word or so more ' bout good and bad times: 
When we've good times, we are living too fast., 
And when we've bad times, we oft think of the 
past; 
We go to extremes, without ever a 
thought., 
'Till experience has taught us—and that dearly 
bought. 
Then we soon know the difference ' tween good 
and bad times. 
BILLY, SAY, IS THIS YOU? 
[Parody on Willie, we have missed you.] 
BY H. ANGELO. 
On! whiskey, was it you, dear, 
Say, say, old chum ? 
That got me down below here 
For thirty days to come. 
Last night I 
was out late, 
And crawled in between some joists, 
BILLY, SAY, IS THIS YOU? 
14 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS. 
For I 
thought I 
heard a 
footstep, 
And a 
policeman's well known voice; 
But he pulled me out—oh dear! 
And said, in a 
voice quite grum, 
Oh, Billy, say, is this you ? 
With me you must come. 
I'm used to spreeiiag nightly, 
But last night beat all; 
My head got rather lightly, 
And went round like a 
ball. 
The taverns were all shut, 
For ' twas twelve o'clock and past, 
When the rain began to sprinkle, 
And came pouring down quite fast. 
But the policeman's well-known voice, 
Through my dizzy head still rung— 
Oh Billy, say, is this you ? 
With me you must come. 
I've just two cents about me, 
That won't buy the beer; 
Old hat, I'll have to spout thee, 
When I 
gets out of here. 
Oh, how I 
wish and watch 
For them thirty days to end, 
So I 
can see them boys once more, 
That's got the dimes to spend. 
Now when I 
gets free again, 
I 
wish some friend would come 
And say, Billy, we have missed you— 
Won't you take some rum ?

JONATHAN SLY. 
ANSWER TO BILLY BARLOW. 
BY II. ANGELO. 
Air—Billy Barlow. 
No doubt ev'rybody's heard Billy Barlow 
Narrate his adventures and make a 
great blow; 
I 
guess as how he's spun out by this time, very nigh, 
For here's a 
real Yankee—one Jonathan Sly. 
Oh, yes, pray listen to I, 
A 
genuine Yankee is Jonathan Sly. 
We Yankee's are pumkins—I mean to say cute— 
We'll out talk the world, and can thrash ' em to boot; 
Our gals are all beauties, no one can deny, 
And of boys—here's a 
specimen—Jonathan Sly. 
Oh, no, you cannot deny, 
A 
genuine Yankee is Jonathan Sly. 
Speculation's my hobby, if I 
make but a 
dime— 
All manner of notions I've bought in my time— 
I'll sell to a 
friend or a 
foe, if they'll buy; 
I 
wants but a 
profit, does Jonathan Sly. 
Oh, yes, you all can rely 
On the truth of a 
Yankee, one Jonathan Sly. 
Don't talk of inventions, for they're not a 
few; 
I've just took a 
patent, ' twould astonish all you— 
It's a 
plan to hang traitors, when our laws they 
defy— 
All foes to our Union—means Jonathan Sly. 
Oh, no, you cannot deny 
A 
genuine Yankee is Jonathan Sly. 
My clothes are all homespun, and real Yankee 
wool— 
My bumps say of music my noddle is full— 
16 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS. 
Play, whistle, and sing Yankee Doodle, can I; 
And tell a 
good story, can Jonathan Sly. 
Oh, dear, the ladies all sigh, 
And cast a 
sheep-eye at young Jonathan Sly. 
If you know a 
young lady in want of a 
beau, 
I'd soon pop the question, if she'll but let me know; 
She might get a 
worse bargain by not takin' I— 
Chock full of affection is Jonathan Sly. 
Oh, yes, gals, listen to I, 
Don't judge by the harness of Jonathan Sly. 
Kind friends I 
must leave you, perhaps I 
intrude ; 
But a 
word or two more, then my song I'll conclude: 
Let the flag of our Union in triumph float high, 
And never desert it, says Jonathan Sly. 
Yes, yes, the world we defy— 
Iluzza for our Union, says Jonathan Sly.

SOME talk about domestic strife, 
Or even a 
bad, tormenting wife, 
But the greatest plague of all your life 
Is troublesome next door neighbours. 
Now Mrs. Squib lives on my right, 
And on my left, there's Mrs. White— 
There in and out from morn till night— 
Tittletattling's their delight— 
One wants to borrow this and that— 
The ' tother sits, and there she'll chat 
Some silly story, stale and flat— 
These troublesome next door neighbours.

ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS. 
Don't talk about domestic strife, 
Or even a 
bad, tormenting wife, 
For the greatest plague in all your life 
Is troublesome next door neighbours. 
Now Mrs. Squib's a 
tongue for use, 
For spreading news, or heap abuse, 
'Cause all she hears she soon lets loose, 
'Bout others of our neighbours. 
But Mrs. White will merely say, 
She only heard, the other day, 
That so and so had run away, 
And left his landlord minus " pay ;" 
'Bout some one's baby, some one's dress, 
Or some one being in distress, 
And how they live they cannot guess. 
Oh! such troublesome next door neighbours. 
Don't talk, & c., & c. 
Then, if my wife has work to do, 
They'll keep her back an hour or two, 
To whisper something they have new 
'Bout others of our neighbours. 
Now don't you tell, says Mrs. White, 
'Twas told to me the other night, 
For if you do, I'm done up quite, 
I 
promised ne'er to tell a 
mite— 
Smither's wife has heard it said, 
Simkins' Adest son—named " Fred,"— 
With widow Jones was going to wed, 
That's the talk among the neighbours. 
Pont talk, &c., & c. 
And for borrowing—there's scarce a 
day, 
Under promise they will pay, 
Some trifle they don't tote away, 
These troublesome next door neighbours. 
They borrow, break, and never mend; 
But still I'm fool enough to lend, 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS. 
And for fear these folks I 
might offend, 
I 
mortally hates for things to send. 
You see I 
know not what to do, 
Whether to stay amongst this crew, 
Or go to the country, where there's few 
Such troublesome next door neighbours. 
Dont talk, & c., & e. 
THE WAYS OF THE TOWN. 
BY H. ANGELO. 
Air—Yankee Doodle. 
On! the tarnal ways of this ' ere town, 
I 
can't help but ' bout speak here, 
As I've kinder been done brown, 
And only been a 
week here. 
I'd no sooner touched the slip 
When lots of fellers, mauling, 
Began my coat to tear and rip, 
With their " Carriage, carriage," bawling. 
Oh the tarnal ways, Szc. 
Then ' bout forty ragged boys, 
Pokin' "Extrees" '
neath my nose, too— 
And twenty boot blacks, with their noise, 
All pullin' at my toes too— 
Three darkies offered, very kind, 
To carry my valise, too, 
So, I 
said, I 
didn't mind, 
But they charged a 
dime apiece, too. 
Oh! the tarnal ways, &c. 
A 
man had shaving soap for sale, 
I 
stopped to hear him gabble; 
Now and then a 
yarn he'd tell, 
Which tickled all the rabble. 
20 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS. 
Another chap wer' tellin' folks, 
He'd stuff to mend their china, 
I 
watched him close, it wern't a 
hoax 
So I 
bought some for Jemima. 
! 
the tarnal ways, & c. 
I 
put up at a 
big hotel, 
And stopped there until now, sirs, 
But when I 
had my bill to shell, 
It made me sarch my trowsers. 
Why, in our parts, I'd board a 
week, 
With what they charge a 
day, sirs, 
I 
kinder thought they had a 
cheek, 
But still I 
had to pay, sirs. 
Oh! the tarnal ways, &c. 
BY TAKING A PEEP AT THE PAPERS. 
BY H. ANGELO. 
Air — Over the water to Charlie. 
ANOTHEIt idea's popped into my brain, 
Which adds a 
new song to my budget. 
My friends, if you'll listen, I'll sing and explain, 
Of its merits I 
leave you to judge it. 
We're told, by one Shakspeare, this world's but a 
stage— 
Humbug is still cutting its capers— 
Now, when you want knowledge, a 
sixpence I'll 
wage, 
You can always find lots in the papers. 
CHORUS.—Were it not for the papers now what 
would we do; 
We'd hear none of the world's silly 
capers; 
Then, when you want knowledge, you'll 
get it, ' tis true, 
By taking a 
peep at the papers. 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS.

The news of the day in the locals is great— 
Murders, mishaps, and a 
fight, too— 
Another bold robbery, or narrow escape, 
Which the public all read with delight, too. 
Then the editor's column, with whims of his own, 
Which he wants the whole world to agree to— 
He'll argue both sides, and opinion make known, 
And right, never wrong, will he be, too. 
CHORUS. 
There's houses for sale, and there's houses to let, 
And daily accounts of house-breaking; 
There's houses on fire, and there's houses for debt, 
Which the sheriff of course has been taking. 
And for wants, you will find that the columns are 
rife— 
Housemaids, store clerks, and child nurses. 
There's wanted a 
husband, or wanted a 
wife, 
And wanted some cash for your purses. 
CHORUS. 
When money is tight, or when money is loose, 
When stocks are gone up, or come down, sirs, 
And when there's a 
wonder—a 
gander or goose— 
They note such arrival in town, sirs. 
They'll issue an extra for this and for that, 
By the aid of our great telegraph, sirs; 
'Twill help fill the paper, and they do it so pat, 
You'll believe it is true, more than half, sirs. 
CHORUS. 
There's lost and there's found, and there's runaway 
wives, 
Who've left without just provocation; 
And quacks with their patents to save all our lives, 
With a 
puff, or a 
recommendation. 
There's goods below cost, selling off to close out; 
Damaged cloth very cheap at the draper's. 
All this, and more too, you'll see without doubt, 
By taking a 
peep at the papers.

FOUR GAY COVES. 
(Quartette.) 
[Written expressly for Sanford's Troupe.] 
EY H. ANGELO. 
Air—Poor Mary Ann. 
On, here we all together stand, 
Us four gay coves. 
We take the shine off Gideon's band, 
Us four gay coves. 
Yes, foot to foot, and shin to shin, 
To sing this song we now begin, 
With one short chorus, let's all "dip in," 
Us four gay coves. 
We had rehearsal all forenoon, 
We four gay coves. 
And guess as how we're all in tune, 
We four gay coves. 
We tuned our throats with a 
whiskey wrench, 
And can reach high notes without a 
bench; 
We sing Italian as well as French, 
We four gay coves. 
We wish some one would volunteer— 
We four gay coves— 
And call us out to take some beer, 
Us four gay coves. 
Or send an invite out to tea— 
Professional gents all hands now be, 
And travel on shape and talent, d'ye see, 
Us four gay coves. 
We'd all look well in a 
photograph, 
Us four gay coves— 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS.

I 
guess ' twoukl only cost a 
"half," 
For us four gay coves. 
Good friends, we'd better "simmer down," 
If we'd keep on perhaps you'd frown— 
Then gi'e us hand, we've done it brown, 
Us four gay coves. 
SONG OF THE LOAFER. 
"I'D MAKE THE MONEY FLY." 
A PARODY ON " I'D BE A BUTTERFLY." 
BY U. ANGELO. 
Orr! how the money flies, millions an hour, 
And I've " nary" threepence, though crippled up 
feet; 
Roving about, like a 
goose in a 
shower, 
And missing my lunch, ' cause I 
can't coax a 
treat. 
Oh! how I 
languish for wealth and for power; 
I'd never shun a 
friend I'd chance to meet. 
I'd make the money fly! passing each hour, 
Saying, " Come up, fellers, it's my next treat!" 
I'd make the money fly! I'd make the money 
fly! 
Saying, " Come up, fellers, it's my next 
treat !" 
Oh! were I 
to find a 
purse of the "ready," 
I'd buy of old rye a 
barrel, by jing! 
My summer days' rambles would be sportive and 
steady, 
I'd sleep in the wood, where the owlingales sing. 
But ' tis as it is, and '
tisser it can't be— 
Poverty, sure, nought but misery brings. 
I'd make the money fly! nothing should daunt me, 
And sleep in the wood where the owlingale sings. 
I'D MARE THE MONEY FLY. 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS. 
25 
I'd make the money fly! I'd make the money 
fly! 
If I'd but the " ready"—I 
would, by jing! 
What if the folks tell me, I'm but a 
loafer, 
The world owes a 
living to all, some say; 
I 
can't see the right folks have to talk so for, 
If the world owes the bill, I 
wish it would pay. 
A 
feller, for years, may toil, then discover 
His purse still empty, as ' twas the first day. 
I'd make the money fly ! living a 
rover— 
That's provided I'd plenty, and had my way. 
I'd make the money fly! I'd make the money 
fly! 
Provided I'd plenty, and had my way.

W E'RE all puffing, puff, pe, puffing, 
We're all puffing our way through this world. 
The taylor puffs his cloth, and the baker puffs his 
bread, 
The lawyer puffs his client, as long as there's a 
" 
RED ;" 
The doctor puffs you up, with lots of pills and stuff, 
'Till he's puffed you out of money, and killed you, 
sure enough. 
With all his, &c., &c. 
The ladies puff with hoops, that take the pavement 
wide, 
They also puff their hair, and puff their beaux be-
side; 
And as they're fond of puffing, you must please the

By puffing them as angels, or they'll puff you 'bout 
the ears.

Our uppertendom gents are some at puffing, too, 
With puffy beard 'pon chin and lips, to hide their 
mouths from view; 
With meerschaum pipe or strong segar, a 
cheap 
one, I 
suppose, 
They'll puff away their horrid smoke, beneath a 
lady's nose. 
So, we're all, & c., & c. 
Musicians, actors,, writers, and singers, too, enough, 
Great photographic pictures hang out, themselves 
to puff. 
Newspapers help them 'long, though puffing is their 
trade; 
They've puffs in great abundance, all of which are 
ready made. 
So, we're all, &c., & c. 
Saving funds will puff, and say they're safe enough ; 
So will banks and brokers, till they've puffed away 
your stuff.

And clear our glorious Union of every ruthless

THAT DON'T PAY. 
BY H. ANGELO. 
Air—Poor old maids. 
FRIENDS, PH sing to you a 
song, 
Called, That don't pay; 
I'll not promise you how long, 
'Cause that don't pay. 
Yes, I'll sing to you a 
song, 
Perhaps it's right, or maybe wrong, 
However, I 
have idees strong 
'Bout what don't pay. 
There's both politics and law, 
Neither one pay— 
They've each an awful paw, 
And that don't pay. 
Yes, there's polities and law, 
They can fix both shrewd and raw, 
And soon empty purse and draw, 
Now that don't pay. 
Now, this selling goods on " tick," 
That don't pay— 
It's enough to make one sick; 
No, that don't pay. 
Yes, this selling goods on " tick," 
Till they've piled it on so thick, 
You've against it got to kick, 
Now that don't pay. 
This expecting help from friends, 
That don't pay. 
One on whom all hope depends, 
Now that don't pay. 
32 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS. 
This expecting help from friends, 
Till you find they " never lends," 
Then your friendship quickly ends; 
Now that don't pay. 
Then by drinking too much rum, 
That don't pay; 
And 'round taverns daily bum, 
Now that don't pay. 
Yes, by drinking too much rum, 
Till your faces show it some, 
And red noses 'gin to come, 
Now that don't pay. 
GOING OUT A SPARKIN' 
BY H. ANGELO. 
Air—Umbrella Courtship. 
My song, perhaps, to married men 
May bring back recollections— 
I 
mean their days of courtship, when 
They wished a 
gal's affections. 
Now, I'm a 
single man, 'tis true, 
But I 
want you all to hearken, 
I've experience, some, as well as you, 
For Pve been out a 
sparkin'. 
Tol de rol, & c. 
When first I 
ventured in that line, 
My heart began to flutter, 
But the name of saying a 
gal was mine, 
Was all I 
wished to utter. 
I'd have some barber dress my hair, 
And dye, its hue to darken, 
Then I'd be off, I 
can't tell where, 
But guess I 
went a 
sparkin'. 
Tol de rol, Sze., Sze.

ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS. 
I 
went to see a 
gal named Sprigs, 
Who lived 'way out of town, too— 
Her dad, a 
butcher, slaughtered pigs, 
And was of some renown, too. 
"c took a 
short cut 'cross the fields, 
When I 
heard his dogs a 
barkin', 
Her dad had set 'em on my heels, 
That settled that 'ere sparkin'. 
Tol de rol, & c., & c. 
A widow gay invited me 
To spend an evening with her— 
I 
went there early, stayed to tea, 
But wished I'd not gone thither. 
Run up like steps, she had eight brats 
Whose smartness I'd to hearken— 
'Sides paw for pennies, they'd like cats, 
When I'd go there a 
sparkin'. 
Tol de rol, &c., Sze. 
But as this subject's known to all, 
I 
guess I'll pass it o'er now; 
Of my experience, that's but small, 
I 
could tell a 
great deal more now. 
This song is true, as I'm alive, 
And a 
word I'm 'bout remarkin'— 
To please the gals I 
always strive, 
'Cause they're so fond of sparkin'.

But nary a " beer or punch."

Picking his teeth he'll stand;

Though he's never a

OWN SHOP. 
LA Parody on London agrah is the Devil's own shop.] 
LOCALIZED BY H. ANGELO. 
From great Londonderry, one morning so merry, 
My own native self, and shillela beside, 
Gave old daddy the slip, then junipt board of a 
ship, 
And ' cross the salt ocean took bit of a 
ride. 
We landed one morning — the weather looked 
charming— 
Myself and shillela both tipsy we got; 
I've been all over town—first up and then down— 
l'hirdelphi', by Jabers, the devil's own shop. • 
CHORUS. 
The advice of my daddy, was mind your eye, 
Paddy, 
This world's full of humbugs, from bottom to 
top ; 
Now, Paddy Mahony, take care of your money— 
PhiPdelphi', by jabers, the devil's own shop. 
There's Doctor Jayne's building, with drugs 'tis 
well filled in, 
By jabers, what money this building has cost; 
There's the custom house, too, such a 
beautiful 
view, 
That's where them one hundred and ninety was 
lost. 
I 
tried for to find it, both front and behind it, 
Devil a 
cent could I 
see anywhere near the spot; 
I 
think they were joking—their fun they've been 
poking— 
Phirdelphi', by jabers, the devil's own shop.

Fairmount's got a 
fountain, and hill like a 
moun-
tain, 
And mighty long steps, too—now boys there's a 
lot; 
Myself and shillela, we mounted 'em gaily, 
Then onward did trudge, till we got to the top. 
Holy murtber, says I, but I'm up mighty high— 
Here's steeples, and chimneys, and the devil 
knows what; 
'Twould puzzle Pat Swope, with his big telescope, 
To tell which was which from 'mongst the whole 
lot. 
CHORUS. 
When coming back home, by myself all alone, 
A 
gentleman, dressed as a 
gentleman should, 
First tipp'd me the wink, then asked me to drink; 
As an Irishman ought to, I 
told him I 
would. 
He filled me with whiskey, until I 
got frisky, 
Then pulled out a 
watch, which he wanted to 
swop; 
Says he, Paddy, it's gold; says I, SO I'm told; 
But Phil'delphi', you know, is the devil's own 
shop. 
CHORUS.. 
In all its resplendence, stands great Independence, 
A 
mighty big hall, with a 
mighty big bell in ; 
And, boys, you must own, 'twill always be known, 
All over creation as liberty's dwelling. 
'T would take more than a 
year, to sing all the 
sights here, 
So with your permission, I 
think I 
will stop; 
Any night you may name, if you'll drop in again, 
I'll sing you Phil'delphi's the devil's own shop.

THE TIMES AS THEY ARE. 
BY II. ANGEL9. 
Air—Bow, wow, wow. 
Tilts world is turning up side down, 
I 
really do believe, sirs; 
The people in it try their best 
Each other to deceive, sirs. 
They say the times are very dull, 
Provisions rather high, sirs; 
But, as it's all the fashion, now 
To make you laugh I'll try, sirs. 
Oh! dear, oh! 
The times are getting worse and worse, 
Oh! dear, oh! 
Should you be blessed with lots of cash. 
You'll always find a 
friend, sirs; 
But if you haven't got a 
cent, 
Their friendship's at an end, sirs. 
A 
friend in need's a 
friend indeed— 
But that no more is thought of, 
Since humbug now has got the sway, 
That's all the people talk of. 
Oh! dear, oh! & c., &c. 
Our dandies now spend all their cash, 
To keep up with the fashion— 
With queer cut coats and women's shawls, 
In Chestnut street they dash on. 
Of women's rights they needn't talk, 
You may depend upon it, 
Another year, instead of hats, 
They'll wear the ladies' bonnets. 
Oh! dear, oh! &c., &c. 
ANGELO'S ORIGINAL SONGS.

Our ladies, when they promenade, 
Wear bonnets down behind 'em— 
They are so small I 
think 'twould take 
A 
microscope to find 'ern. 
Their dresses, too, look like balloons, 
And take up all the walk, sirs— 
The beaux cannot get near enough 
To have a 
little talk, sirs. 
Oh! dear, oh! &c., &c. 
Now if you don't feel very well, 
And wish to take a 
ride, sirs, 
Stop a 
railway car that's passing by, 
Although it's full inside, sirs. 
" 
There is no room," some voice cries out, 
But open goes the door, sirs, 
Conductor, very gruff, exclaims, 
" 
There's room for twenty more, sirs." 
Oh! dear, oh! & c., &c. 
When forced to ride in railroad cars, 
Your tickets you've secured, sirs, 
Take my advice before you go, 
And get your life insured, sirs. 
For when they smash they'll break your back, 
And damages you claim, sirs, 
The verdict of the jury'll be, 
Nobody is to blame, sirs.

Although there's many a

The cut of it, of course suits me.

Each tear I

Patched up in a

Through fashion's thoroughfare, 
Both old and young now stalk in, 
Gaping at the sights they see, 
In Chestnut street whilst walking. 
Too ral loo, &e. 
News boys bawling, " Ledgers"— 
Others, " Black your boots, sir"— 
Some making fun of ladies, 
With those enormous hoops, sir— 
Fops, in the tip of fashion, 
Bowing, scraping, talking, 
You'll see this every day, 
In Chestnut street whilst walking. 
Too ral loo, &c.

Jammed in tight together—

Too ral loo, & e. 
Handsome stores and windows, 
Handsome ladies shopping— 
Some one's purse must suffer,

In Chestnut street whilst walking.

Beneath the shady trees, 
Near old Independence,

Shine in great resplendence.

Men with patents hawking—

In Chestnut street whilst walking. 
Too ral loo, Ste. 
There's always something new 
To attract attention 
In this great thoroughfare,

walk'd my toes clean out my shoe, 
To sing dis song, white folks, to you. 
Dat's my style now, white folks, white 
folks, 
Dat's my style now, white folks, white 
folks, 
I'm professor ob de old banjo. 
I 
met a 
gal on Chestnut street, 
She, at a 
distance, looked so sweet; 
I 
got ' long side, but she said go ' way, 
But I 
hung out well, and 'gun to say, 
Dat's my style, & c., & c. 
I 
promenaded ' bout a 
square, 
And talked what lub I 
had to spare; 
I 
stole a 
kiss, and a 
good bye bid, 
Turned on my heels, and 'way I 
slid. 
Dat's my style, & c. 
Tinks I, my lub, I'll call on you, 
Dis mornin' I 
wrote a 
billy-dou;

I 
signed myself a 
barber's clerk, 
But found de gal done kitchen work. 
But dat's my style, & c., & c. 
An answer come in a 
little while, 
I 
must hab cash, an awful pile; 
Or else wid me she'd neber wed— 
I 
soon wrote back, I'd nary red. 
Dat's my style, &c., &c. 
So dat's de way wid gals now days, 
Dey'll flirt about and make displays; 
Dey'll smash your hearts, but you can't get 
deirs, 
Unless you put on de " big bug" airs. 
Dat's deir style, &c., &c.

'Case she looked so bewitchingly fair. 
Her dress cost a

AT LAST I AM ENGAGED. 
COMIC SONG FOR THE LADIES. 
BY H. ANGELO. 
[Music by Coulston, 147 North 8th Street.] 
Six years I 
have been looking for 
(Although but twenty-three) 
Some nice young man, with courage true 
Enough to marry me. 
I've found at last the very man, 
And have him snugly caged; 
Successfully I've laid my plans, 
At last I 
am engaged. 
I 
am engaged! I 
am engaged! 
Oh! yes, I 
am engaged. 
Successfully I've laid my plans, 
At last I 
am engaged. 
He wears moustache and goatee too, 
That's just the man for me. 
My mind I've had made up some time, 
And married soon shall be. 
I 
hinted to him oft and on, 
Got Cupid war to wage, 
And quickly made him captive then— 
At last I 
am engaged. 
I 
am, &c., &c. 
We in the parlor sat one night, 
When he the question popped— 
Although we girls love coaxing too, 
" 
Yes," from my lips soon hopped. 
Both pa and ma oppose the match, 
With me they seem enraged— 
But I've a 
husband in my mind, 
At last I 
am engaged. 
I 
am, & c., &c.
