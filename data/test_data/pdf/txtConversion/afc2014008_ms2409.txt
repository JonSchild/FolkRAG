The p

well proportioned.  On entering t

good-natured.
 
He had p
reached t

 way;
 
and yet they s
ap one's moral f

one's d

her a

eply t
o every d

ost a
 pound myself that '
fort-

go on with your d
iplomas; I
 ought not t

have i
nterrupted.
 
"Cheerfulness should be part o
f the
 
graduating course," s
aid the d
iploma-
maker, thoughtfully, "and an ability t

"In short, your graduate must be per-

"How many  d

could ever be g

"There's t

Of course

Those windows of t

So f

To be sure,

I l

Are l

Yes, yes,

ife  o

1 sa w  her  f
irst In  the  for m  of an  ivory
 
miniature  i
n  her  brother  Chan cy's  state-
roo m  i
n  the  s
tea mer  Quaker  City,  in  the
 
Bay  of  Smyrna,  i
q  t
he  su m mer  of  1
867,
 
when  she  was  in  her  twenty-second  year.
 
I sa w her in the f
lesh for the f
irst t
i me in
 
Ne w York in  the  follo wing  Dece mber. She
 
was s
lender  and beautiful  and  g
irlish —and
 
sho was both g
irl and wo man.  She re main -
en both 941 and wo man to the last day of
 
her l
ife.  Under a grave and gentle exterior
 
burned  i
nextinguishable  f
ires  of  sy mpathy,
 
energy, devotion, enthusias m, and absolutely
 
l
i mitless affection.  She was a
l ways, f
rail i
n
 
body,  and she l
ived  upon her spirit,  whose
 
hopefulness and courage were indestructible.
 
Perfect t
rUth, perfect honesty, perfect can-
doi,  were  qualities of her character which
 
were born with her.  T
ier judg ments of peo-
p
le and things were sure and accurate. Her
 
i
ntuitions  a
l mott  never  deceived
 her. In
 
hei
' jud
ments of the characters and acts of
 
both  f
riends  and  s
trangers,  there was  al-
ways  roo m  for  charity,  and this charity
 
rover  failed.  I have  co mpared and con-
t
ta ted  her with  hundreds of persons, and
 
m y conviction  re mains  that  hers  was the
 
most  perfect  character  I have  ever met.
 
And I may add that she was the most win-
ningly d
ignified person I have ever kno wn.
 
Her character  and  d
isposition  were of the
 
sort that not only i
nvites worship, but co m-
mends i
t.  No servant ever l
eft her service
 
who deserved to re main in i
t. And,  as she
 
could choose with a g
lance of l
eer eye,  the
 
servants she selected d
id in a
l most a
ll cases
 
deserve  to  re main,  and  they  d
id  re main.
 
She was a
l ways cheerful;  and she  was a
l-

THE REUNION OF THE TO IS.
 
A l
ittle t
oy bug and a l
ittle t
oy mouse
 
And a l
i
ttle t
oy t
iger met
 
On t
he l
ittle t
oy porch of a l
ittle toy hous'
 
Where a l
ittle t
oy table was set.
 
And t
he l
i
ttle t
oy  mouse wailed:  "Oh
 
my!"
 
And the l
ittle toy t
iger atte mpted t
o speak
 
But emitted a sad l
ittle s
igh.
 
A l
i
ttle t
or soldier, set down a toy cup
 
And i
ndulged i
n a p
itiful wail,
 
And sadness ca me o'er a l
ittle t
oy pup
 
With a poor l
ittle S
tu mp of a tail;
 
And a l
ittle t
oy engine that ran on a t
rack
 
Gave a sad l
ittle t
oot as i
t sped
 
And a l
ittle b
isque doll sad:  "Alas  am
 
a
lack!
 
I r
eally wish I were dead!"
 
Then a brisk l
ittle Jack popped out i
n th
 
a
ir
 
Fro m a box he had opened so meho w,
 
And he said t
o the t
oys:  "This i
s s
trange
 
I
 declare!
 
W hat makes you so sad?  W hat's  th
 
row?"
 
And  the  l
ittle b
isque  doll  put a l
ittle
 
b
isque hand
 
On her l
ittle b
isque heart, and replied:
 
"
I' m a s
tranger a
lone i
n a s
trange, fore
i
gn  
I
 and."
 
And the others in unison s
ighed.
 
And the soldier said:  "That's what's tht
 
matter with me;
 
I
'm ho mesick and l
onely today,
 
For the ones that I l
ove are far over the
 
sea —
 
Oh, Why d
id they bring me away?"
 
And the l
ittle toy mouse and the l
ittle t
oy
 
CUP,
 
And the l
ittle t
oy table and p
late
 
And the l
ittle toy t
iger and the l
ittle t
oy
 
pup
 
Had the sa me l
ittle tale t
o relate.
 
Then the Jack-in-the-Box dashed  a t
eat
 
f
ro m h
is eyes,
 
And said i
n a sorro wful t
one:
 
t
oo, am a s
tranger beneath a s
trpng
 
sky,
 
Far, far f
ro m the haunts I
 have know,!
 
They made me i
n Ger many, thousands o
l
 
miles
 
Across the b
lue ocean!"  And o
'er
 
The f
aces around h
i m there broke hapr)
 
smiles
 
Where sadness was p
ictured before.
 
"Made over i
n  Germany!" shouted the doll.
 
"
I, t
oo, was made there!"  And the bug
 
And the soldier and t
iger and puppy and
 
a
ll
 
Rushed forward to g
ive her a hog.
 
"They made me i
n Ger many," each of the m
 
cried.
 
"Wie gehts!" squeaked the mouse to the
 
Jack;
 
"Danke shoen," in a g
la d l
ittle vo i
ce  be 
replied —
 
The engine l
eaped c
lear f
ro m i
ts t

Then the l
ittle t
oy bug and the l
ittle t
oy
 
mouse,
 
And the soldier and doll and the rest,
 
Formed a r
ing on the porch of the l
ittle t
oy
 
house,
 
And Joy was i
n each l
ittle breast.
 
And they sang: "Made in Ger many, o
'er the
 
s
ea
 
And they danced a
ll around with delight—
 
And a l
ittle boy woke and sat up and said
 
he:
 
"Why, they're Just as I l
eft the m l

 —S. B. Kiser.
 
"Did you ever see such wild  
f
lo wers?" he
 
exclai med, as he walked with her afield.
 
"You'd be Just as wild  yourself,"  pro-
t
ested a modest delsy, i
ndignantly, "
