General Manager of Texas Terminals 
 
00:00:49 
Grew up in Galena Park. On the ship channel. Would go down to the ship channel as a 
child, watching ships come and go. Wanted to be in the business. Took a part time job at 
a small private docks facility while in college. Loaded small vessels. One of their 
customers was West India line. Worked with roll on and roll off operation. Started going 
to college in the night time. WEst india line had property on the sea port. Started their 
own facility, when they did offered him a job in April 1970. Been in the business ever 
since.  
 
00:03:17 
Started at the bottom doing everything. Became a tallyman, receiver clerk, tracking the 
cargo, documented it. Then ended up in the ship in the gang. Wanted to know everything. 
Only member in family in the maritime business. Father worked for Aramco steel. Closed 
in the early 80s.  
 
00:05:06 
Tallyman documents the cargo that is loaded on the ship. Earlier things were manual and 
handwritten. Dock receipts were even typed up. THe movement of cargo was all manual. 
Ships have changed, have become "user friendly". Easier to work, better equipment. 
Cargo has gotten large. Ships have had to increase capacity of ships. Ships earlier could 
handle 5 tons.  
 
00:08:28 
West India Line- came at 22 years of age. Was asst. operations manager. Ended up taking 
over the total management of the facility. Worked for the operating company. Closed 
company after partners couldn't agree on the business after founder passed. Always loved 
cranes and was involved in West INdia with cranes buying and selling. Care shipping 
was building Crane terminals. Crane represented small containers service. Was offered a 
job. Became their general manager at Care Terminal. Back then container rates got bad, 
all carriers were losing money, because it cost them more to move then what they were 
 
 
getting. Container companies provide trucks with chassis, very expensive to care and 
maintain. Finances got so bad they had to close their container shipment business. 
Owners decided to sell the place. Sold it to port of Houston in 1995. Took time off after 
that. C.A Rousser took up the facility and tried to sell it. Opened it under a new owner. 
Was concerned about good service and tried level best to provide it. Built a small 
business and managed to get some old people back.  
 
00:19:01 
Couple of crane operators are the oldest employees who are now still around. Cranes are 
used in a number of areas. Big demand for crane operators. Forklifts and crane comes in 
different sizes and can carry different types of cargo. Some admin members have still 
stuck around,  
 
00:23:02 
Belong to industry organizations and whenever new technologies and methods are 
introduced, try to be in the know of it and learn it and use it of it helps. Always need to 
keep ears and eyes open. Such as Cargo documentation or FID. Anytime there isa process 
that can improve the operations, try to go with it. Department heads mentor everyone 
under them. People need to be trained in a particular way. Supervisors are very involved 
in mentoring their juniors. Safety is very important in the industry. 20 years ago did not 
see any hard hats in this line of work. PPE - personal protective equipment such as hard 
hats and safety boots. Training is very important.  
 
00:29:44 
Have always enjoyed the industry, been very hands on. Have been at work from before 
daylight to after dark. Need to be very involved while building a business. Have always 
enjoyed it. Have expected employees to do a good job also.  
 
00:32:50 
Facility built to handle heavy cargo. Most docks are by the water, own piling and maybe 
dock strength is not much, Older docks only have500 lb.. of square foot capacity. Crane 
have always been of interest. Back then, did not see many cranes on the docks.  
 
00:34:49 
Old boss was a salesman. Name Jim Allen. Was an Aggie. DIed at 56 in 1982 Extremely 
outgoing, never met a stranger. Leant a lot about cranes from him. Learnt social skills and 
people skills from him. Was a great motivator and people person. Business is all about 
relations. He understood cranes mechanically. Taught what each lever does. Crane 
operators need to do separate things with each hand. Are special people. Crane operation 
is pure geometry.  
 
00:39:15 
 
 
Stevedoring - the word means unloading and loading. Supervisors make a big difference. 
Get a lot of different types of cargo. Have very experiences and very knowledgeable 
supervisors for handling cargo. Need a lot of good experience. Not a lot of them around. 
Try to train them in a professional fashion. Manufacturers have people who train our 
employees. Try to put new people through more class-room time than in the past. Always 
looking for good people. Last year hired 98 new people but were left with just 19.  
 
00:43:18 
People not wanting to be here on weekends, not caring enough, not being productive. 
They are taught that they are salespeople. Try not to hire anyone who doesn’t speak 
English. Sometimes difficult to find the quality employee that is needed. Constantly 
trying to find good workforce. Admin, invoicing, acct. payable etc. Downstairs - cargo 
documentation and operations. Operations deals with handling the cargo, dealing with 
customers about movement of cargo. Tallyman, labor category. Operations is larger 
group of people.  
 
00:47:42 
One major con for the employees is will have to put them wherever the need is at that 
moment. Cannot put them where they want to be, some people are used to doing only one 
thing and that does not work here. If employees were not flexible, would have to double 
the staff. Very competitive business as is.  
When truck comes into deliver cargo, it is met by a truck office. Will inspect papers and 
identify it and will pass it to receiving clerk. Will inspect the cargo and take it to a place 
for unloading. Gets it unloaded. Ocean carrier is paid by either cubic or dimensions of 
cargo or weight. Either cubic meter or metric ton, whichever is greater. Cargo 
documenters input it into the system and it generates a receiving report. It then goes to a 
load list for that particular ship. The forklift operators unloading the truck. Supervisor 
directing the operations. Crane operators and gear men have rigorous work. They know 
the tools to use. Involved along with labor. Ship superintendent has complete control of 
the vessel operations on the company's behalf. He also coordinates with the gang 
foreman. 2-3 gangs to the ship. 5 people. Tallyman are also called clerks. There is a 
tallyman with each gang as well. Clerk known as pusher shows the crew the order in 
which to be loaded. Most of the time a port captain is also involved. There is a diagram 
that shows how it to be loaded. Very important to know the port rotation as a ship can 
call on many different ports before the final destination. So need to know that 
information in order to load it in the order of unloading. THe Stow plan also shows the 
port of discharge for all the goods. Generate a full load list after loading to teh ocean 
carrier and the agent.  
A lot of ships are three holds today. 2 decks in each hold. The bottom deck is called a 
tank top because below that are tanks that help keep the ship stable. Ships today use 
bunker sea fuel, bi-product of refining process. So thick it has to be heated to be pumped 
through a line. Some ships will have bunker tanks. Part of the stevedoring gang is also 
crane operators. Load a lot of heavy cargo with ship cranes. Attract heavy cargo. Regular 
 
 
business to load blowout preventers on ships that are drill ships in the Far East and 
sometimes the Persian Gulf. Blowout preventers are big structures that sit on the surface 
of oil wells. It controls the flow of oil and if there is a problem the blowout preventers 
close down restricting the fire and the flow of oil. THey weigh about 600,000 lb.  
 
01:03:37 
THe second largest crane on the ship front is a 300 ton crane and company has two of 
those. Barge crane called Big John, can lift 500 short tons and works up and down the 
channel. Vessel superintendent is in charge of the operations. Directs people in the yard, 
clerks considered the pushers locate the cargo ahead of time. Vessel superintendent plans 
the whole flow ahead of time. People work long hours while working a ship.  
 
01:07:07 
Non union labor. All stevedores that work at the Turning Basin or the city docks are 
union labor. Container terminals at the port authority are also union. Hourly labor at the 
company. Make money on the overtime. Overtime always helps.  
 
01:09:04 
No relation between Texas Terminal and Houston port authority. Port treats the other 
facilities as competition. Don’t treat the other facilities as the common industry. Texas 
Terminals is busy. Wish there wasn't such a competitive nature between the terminals. 
Non union cannot work at the Houston Port Authority. Handle respective markets. Most 
container carriers are signatories to the union contracts so they have to use union labor. 
SO Barbers Cut, Bay Port will always have business.  
 
01:13:31 
Since the property is owned by Texas Terminals, can offer incentives to shippers that the 
port cannot. Port makes money off wharfage. Wharfage is a charge for cargo going over a 
dock. Today, typical wharfage rate is $3.11 for 2000 lb. Port Authority has always tried 
to attract steel for the Turning basin. That's where the port makes its money. Dockage is 
the charge applied to the vessel for being at the dock, per diem charge based upon the 
length of the ship. 450 ft ship - $4.50 cents for lineal foot per day. Port charges dockage 
to the ship and wharfage to the cargo owner. Most steam ships agents represent vessel 
themselves. Port of Houston is probably the largest port in the Gulf for handling steel. 
Most of the money comes from the container terminals.  
 
01:17:17 
When the port of Houston published tonnages, they include everything. Crude oil makes 
up most of the tonnage. Don’t submit information to them on a regulate basis. Sometimes 
will call and ask and then will give them. Port Authority is very involved in making sure 
dredging of the ship channel happens. Maintenance dredging was last done in 2009. 
Typically done every 5 years. trying to generate finds to get it done every 4 years since it 
silts up very quickly. THe channel is a "huge ditch" as it has no flowing, running water 
 
 
other than the Gulf of Mexico. When cold fronts come down, the north winds follow and 
with them lose 4 ft of water every two days. When that happens, some ships, like the 
large tankers have to restrict their draft by a foot or two. It is a great expense. Takes more 
ship loads to bring in same cargo. Most of the ship traffic is mainly chemical tankers, 
crude tankers and container ships.  
 
01:21:00 
Have a lot of power generation equipment. GE Builds modular power plants. Build 
several different sizes. Smallest is 25 megawatt. QLSO BUILD 50 AND 100 megawatt 
units. Pretty aggressive sales effort around the world. Texas terminals handles their 
export. Their 100 megawatt unit's main module weighs 380,000 lbs and is over 15 ft 
wide. Move it by rail. Also handle on shore drilling equipment. TO Risers are the long 
pipes almost 90 ft long. some of the 90 footers weigh 75,000 lbs. Go from drill ship to the 
ocean floor to the blowout preventer. Serve as the well in the ocean. Every drill ship has 
to have them. Have handled rigs themselves. Anything related to petrochemicals and oil 
equipment. Future will handle the generator portion of the windmill for export.  
 
01:25:53 
75% of business is export. sometime ago, 75% of business was import. So there is a good 
growth in export. Make it attractive for shippers to marshal cargo and collect it and 
search for ships to book it with an ocean carrier. 50% of export business is from shippers, 
forwarders and manufacturers that deliver cargo to Texas Terminals. Marshalling is the 
collecting of cargo, waiting till all pieces are built and delivered to a dock facility, and 
then collected to be loaded on to a ship to be delivered to a site. Give very attractive 
terms to people to allow them to collect cargo here.  
 
01:27:49 
Have 80,000 sq ft of warehouse space. Don’t have a lot of cargo that needs to be in 
warehouse. Liner service is an ocean carrier that calls a certain trade plane. Goes to the 
same ports over and over again. Makes a revolution. Most of export cargo is booked on 
chartered vessels known as the tramp industry. Tramp ships goes wherever the cargo is, 
loads it and takes it where it needs to go . Most of the cargo that needs warehouses is 
from the liner business. Large rolls of cardboard used to make corrugated cardboard 
boards. Each roll can weigh up to 5000 lbs. about 5 ft tall and 5 ft in diameter. Needs to 
be in a warehouse.  
 
01:31:30 
To build a container terminal takes a lot of money. Port authority can generate fund for 
that. a lot of Pot authorities will lease the container terminal to a stevedoring company. 
At the port of Houston they want to operate their own container terminal. Warehousing 
away form the dock area is a different business. Warehousing at the port should be 
referred to as transit sheds.  
 
 
 
01:34:10 
Some of the business is from ship agents. Agents represent ocean carrier if they are not 
familiar with Houston. Good service is always a recommending factor. Have good 
relations with most of them. A lot of the steel that comes to Houston goes to the city 
docks.  
 
01:37:05 
Consider people as assets more than other people do. Treat employees better than most 
do. Operate in a little more expensive fashion, as have a lot of people on the terminal 
side. Staffed to handle the busy days. Manchester terminals has acquired liner from the 
past because of more warehouse space. They have services toRussia - Aluminum ingots. 
Large warehouse space did attract cargo for them in the past. But it has changed. MT was 
built in the 1920s in the days of cotton. All warehouses back then was at the edge of the 
water because of cotton loading.  
 
01:41:06 
Meeting people form all over the world has really been an interesting part of the business. 
Have met people from every country in the world and ,made good friends with some of 
them. Japanese have been the most interesting people ever met. Used to make a point of 
visiting with the captain. Usually give gifts to the captain, chief mate and chief engineer. 
Get some business through them sometimes.  
Bugassi - dynamic, wealthy, has a lot of ships. Freight forwarding industry has a lot of 
international people. Late 70s Europeans came and started buying local businesses. They 
wanted to establish a presence here.
