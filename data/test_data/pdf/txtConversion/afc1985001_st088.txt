Pretty Fair Maid
PRETTY FAIR MAID 4115 28B
Mrs Sullivan Shafter, 1940
A pretty fair maid all in a garden A jolly young soldier came a-marching by And stepped up
to the gate to meet her, O say, O say, won't you marry me?
O say, O say, can't you fancy a soldier Can't you fancy a soldier and marry me? O no, O
no, my kind young fellow A man of honor you may be For I have a sweetheart in the army
Though he's been gone three years from me.
Perhaps your sweetheart has been drownded Or in some battle has been slain Or perhaps
he's to some purty girl married You'll never see his face again.
I hope he's happy if he's drownded Or in some battle he's been slain Or if he's to some
purty girl married I love the girl that married him.
He ran his hands all in his pocket His gingers being both long and slim Drew out a ring that
she had gave him And at his feet the maid did fall.
He picked her up and then he kissed her O say, O say won't you marry me? O say, O say,
can't you fancy a soldier Can't you fancy a soldier and marry me?
O yes O yes, my own true lover, A man of honor you may be But if you'd a bin gone just
three years longer No man on earth would have married me.
Come all you fair and (?) old ladies Take warning by a girl like me And if you have a true
love roaming Just wait, and he'll return to thee.
