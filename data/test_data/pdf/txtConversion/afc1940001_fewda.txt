Few DaysOur Country now is great and free,Few days, few days;And thus shall it forever be,We
know the way,Though rummie foes may gather here,Few days, few days,We will protect what we
hold dear,We know the way!Chorus:We'll battle innovation,Few days, few days,And fight against
ursurpationBy a cunning foe.For our guide's the Temp'rance banner,Few days, few days,Our
guide's the Temperance banner,We know the way.The world shall see that we are true,Few days,
few days,And that we know a thing or two,We know the way!As Temperance men go hand in
hand,Few days, few days;Our countless throng shall fill the landWe know the way!Chorus: We'll
battle innovation, [&c?].Then shout aloud, o'er hill and plain,Few days, few days,We will Temperance
rights maintain,We know the way!We'll always guard it with our might,Few days, few days;And keep it
steadfast in the right,We know the way!Chorus: We'll battle innovation, [&?].
