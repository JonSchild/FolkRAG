INTERVIEW WITH SYPHA HAM, LOG 
00:01:58 
Her personal history. 
Story of where from and how she got here from Cambodia, from the city of Phnom Phen. Born 
in 1953 and had to leave Cambodia on April 3, 1975. Went to Thailand first, to American 
embassy there. Came to US in June 1975. First came to California. Her Sister's boss sponsored 
her family. 
Then moved to Virginia. Her sponsor's family helped them get everything they needed when 
they moved here. 
00:05:00 
Moved to Columbus in 1981. Came because her sister's husband had a 
job here. The sister 
asked her to come help open the store. At the time there were not any Asian food or markets 
around. 
00:06:08 
Store carries food from many different Asian countries, but it is mostly Cambodian. Lists 
different places of where food comes from: Lao, Thai, sound Vietnam, Mexico, Semolina, 
Philippines. 
00:07:10 
When started was it only Cambodian? Also Vietnam, Thai, Lao, 
00:07:27 
Do Americans come here? 
Yes and Africans come too. They like Asian food. 
00:08:00 
When Americans first started coming here, she had to explain how to cook the food. 
00:08:22 
They put some signs in English, but don't have to frequently because they have English on the 
foods. 
00:08:44 
Discussion of American responses to the different smells of the food. Any complaints? No they 
like it. 
Say the store is clean. Like the smells. 
People enjoy coming here; when waiting on the food they like to look around. She was 
pleasantly surprised to find that the "office person" doesn't mind to come here to sit (they have a 
restaurant serving Thai food). They like the food, Thai food, even "high" Columbus persons 
don't mind." 
00:10:10 
Do people ask about Cambodia? She tells them what the food like. Some dishes are too long or 
too many ingredients to cook. 
00:11:00 
She buys some ingredients-- vegetable and fruits--from Cambodian farmers. There are 
Cambodian farmers in Florida that have 5 
acres to grow Thai bananas and a 
few other things. 
00:12:20 
Son and husband works here. Daughter is a 
nurse at Ohio State University. She wanted her 
children to have a 
good education. She succeeded. She feels bad because she was not able to 
have a 
good education because of the government of Cambodia growing up. She told her 
husband she wanted better for their children. 
She learned Cambodian; French Second Language; and English was third language. Now she 
can hear French but not speak it well. 
00:15:37 
She speaks Cambodian in the store to her family, and also teaches a 
little bit of Cambodian to her 
customers. 
00:16:29 
The store is more than just a 
store. She teaches [and reaches] people through the store. 
She likes people. Wants to take care of people. Doesn't care if people come in to look without 
buying anything. 
00:17:34 
Are there many Cambodians in Columbus that come here and need help? 
Sister has helped to sponsor refugees. That is why sister wanted her to open store so she can use 
that money and food to help the refuges. Can get money from government to help feed the 
refuges that they have sponsored. 
00:19:12 
People also come who need help with food ad no transportation. He husband will help them get 
to and from. 
00:20:12 
Work hours are long: no day off. Seven days a 
week. Early morning until late at night. But says 
she is lucky and enjoys it. 
00:20:46 
She is "glad of her life". Has proved a 
lot. Never took food stamps or any help when she came 
to USA. Her sponsor helped them to get a 
job right away. First worked at Holiday Inn 
(housekeeping) and then went to school at night. 
00:23:04 
Mom and Dad were ran businesses in Cambodia. They had a 
shop. Husband didn't; he used to 
work for and at the airport ( 1978 government sent him to Thailand to learn about working at 
airport). 
00:21:51 
Story of how she met her husband and how her husband came to the US to Washington DC. He 
was supposed to go back to Cambodia but couldn't go back because of the fall of the 
government. They got to choose where they wanted to go. He picked US. Said some people did 
decide to go back because they had families sent back in a 
boat via Thailand. Only 2 
of the 20 
people survived getting back into the country. 
00:25:42 
She was fortunate that she left Cambodia for Thailand when she did. A 
week after left (April 
15th) was the takeover. Now they have new community and new life. 
It also feels they are like 
staying in Cambodia because of the friends that come in (to the store).
