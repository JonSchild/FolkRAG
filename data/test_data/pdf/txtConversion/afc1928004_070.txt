SONGSTER. 
Irish Shoo rly. 
song and Dance. Composed and sung with great success by 
J. H. Ryan, at Tony Pastor's. 
The subject of my song you'll very soon find out, 
For as you go along Shoo Fly those niggers 
shout. 
When first I 
did arrive it seemed so odd to me. 
To Lear them shouting Shoo Fly, no matter 
where I 
be. 
MMUS. 
Shoo Fly seems odd to !lift,' 
Hear it bhout where ere I 
be 
The tun of which I 
could not see, 
1 
being Irish Paddy McGee. 
(Dance walk around chorus., 
Yes it is clear to me it seems queer, 
As Shoo Fly's been all the rage. 
With those niggers on the stage,

I 
join in the fun no matter where I 
be, 
But Shoo Fly seems very old, 
To Irish Paddy McGee. 
• 
Shoo Fly, etc. 
I 
met a 
friend, of mine I 
asked the meaning of Shoo 
Fly, 
To which of course he made the following reply. 
Ile says, should you be accosted by a 
nigger on 
your way, 
You need but shout out Shoo Fly and he will 
run away. 
Shoo Fly, etc. 
I 
pnried with my friend coming down Grand street, 
When a 
teilow met inc on the way, 
And asked it 
Id treat, with me he sought to 
quarrel, 
But me shillaleh I 
let fly, I 
walked away 
Quite cool remarked, Shoo Fly, don't budder me. 
Shoo Fiy, etc. 
Now I've done me song I 
hope I 
pleased you all, 
I 
will not detain you long, but some ° tiler time

If I 
but told to you what occurred to me, 
By a 
nigger trying his Shoo Fly tricks on Irish 
Paddy McGee.

We're True Sons of Erin. 
As written, composed and sun; by J. H. Ryan. 
Each day, poor Erin, thousands leave ) ou, 
And sure what can you do alone. 
But no wonder when some do deceive you, 
And drive your true sons far from home. 
When I 
read of our girls once so gayly, 
As over history's pages 1. glance, 
When Pat would twist his big shillaleh, 
low he'd bring his colleen through the dance. 
CHORUS. 
Saving, join in the sport, ha ha,

Make one think sure although we're poor, 
Where e're we go let's still be true,

And though ihe enemy are prowl ng, 
Our men shall gather on the bill. 
Farewell sister and li:tle br ther, 
Though I

And help to break her long locked chain.

And we're told we'll soon awake; 
So poor ( Id Erin don't. be weeping, 
Ii ough your sons this foreign home may seek. 
For the many true sons you're after.rearing, 
Soon will return with a

And avenge the troubles you are bearing -

The Bold Pat Colleg.
,an. 
Composed and sung by J. II. Ryan.. 
Sure I 
am the bold Pat O'Regan, 
Though amongst you I'm not yet known; 
But many is the heart I 
have lett breaking, 
Since I 
started from famed sweet Athlone, 
Where the people they all did admire me. 
And the girls all at me would smile • 
The truth is, they all did desire me, 
As a 
son of the Emerald Isle. 
CHORUS. 
When at a 
party I'm called for a 
song, 
The girls all at me do smile ; 
I 
do it so quare, I 
make them all stare, 
At this son of the Emerald Isle. 
One day as I 
walked down through Broadway, 
A 
young lady to me gave a 
nod, 
And most politely she asked me 
If I'd come from the Emerald sod. 
As I 
gazed at this charming young crelture, 
All the blood in my veins seemed to boil, 
For she seemed to admire every feature 
Of the son from the Emerald Isle. 
When it, etc. 
Now, as my heart being-light and airy, 
I 
asked her name plump and straight; 
She answered, my name is Kate Carey, 
And hoped that again we might meet.

And sure he came from the Emerald Isle. 
When at, etc. 
Now after a 
long conversation, 
Of course, then I 
thought it no harm, 
So then, without any persuasion 
So gently she leant- on my arm. 
We walked and we talked at our leisure, 
And when parting, I 
knew by her smile, 
That she felt a 
mighty great pleasure 
In being with this son of the Emerald Isle.

Life is like a

While others are beginning,

That gives an early winning; 
But if you chance to fall behind 
Ne'er slack in your endeavor, 
Just keep that motto in your mind,

The Fifteenth Amendment. 
Composed and sung with unbou-ideel applause, by J. 11. Ryan, 
and J. Welch. 
Arrah, sure, I 
gue-s you all did hear 
The latest news that seems so queer, 
Tuere is no sh w

Since the Fifteenth Amendment. 
Sure as this is the land of the free, 
I 
just come over the sights to see. 
They say a 
nil:runt- is as goad as vim or 
Since the Fiiteentt. Amendmeht. 
SPOKEN — Yes, gentlemen, but my opinion o. the 
state of atiaird in general is that 
TUE IRISH SHOO-PLY soxasTru. 
CHORUS. 
It would be the devil's own sight- 
to see, 
A 
nayg ,r 
in a 
white ta.i ily, 
Taking your sister out for a 
sore; 
Or eloiing with your mother. 
The other day as I 
strayed out, 
A 
bi 
buck nayger at ne did shout 
Saying, Paddy you're gone up the spout 
Since the Fifteenth Amendment. 
I 
returned the compliment right away. 
Says L 
wait until election day, 
you'll find that Paddy will have a 
say, 
When ye naygers are a 
voting. 
SPOKEN.— Sure enough I'd like to sac tha niv-
ger that would come to the election box wall, me 
when 1 
get naturalized. 
I 
d 
give him such a 
tip 
with this, undtr the left side of the right leg that 
he'll be sure to meet with a 
long sickness or bud-
dea death, for, as I 
said belore, gentlemen, 
It would, etc. 
You'll find they will not rest content, 
Ti I 
they have a 
nayger president, 
For all the stamps are nearly spent, 
In giving them education. 
'It seems they're trying with all their might, 
,If they could, they'd make a 
nayger white: 
Faith between them and the Woman's Rights, 
This country is gone to the divil. 
SPOHEN — Yes, gen lemen, but I'm. sure its no 
business of mine at all, at all, only that I'm still 
ot the opinion and will tell the day I. kick the 
bucket, that, 
It would, etc.

THE IRISh 
SHOO-FLY 
Now, gentlemen, do you think its far, 
To let a 
nayger in the chair, 
Or have a 
colored city Mayor, 
By this Fifteenth Amendment. 
I'm sure you'd get a 
great surprise 
To see them getting naturalized ; 
Faith you'd see gorillas in disguise, 
At the polls on next election. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, gentlemen, talking of enrprisp, 
sure it was myself that was surprised to see the 
coal yard they were making of the Coope, Institute 
on a 
certain occasion. 
It was not tali then the 
idea struck me, that 
It would, to 
I 
find they have the cheek as well, 
To sit above in the Saint Nicholas Hotel; . 
°They act the part of an English swell, 
Since the Fifteenth Ameudment. 
But one thing gives me great delight, 
You may think I'm wrong, but I 
think I'm' 
right; 
They can't come amongst us here to-night, 
And that's where the fun comes in, boys. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, gentlemen, one of them had the 
cheek to tell me the other day he wai my brother. 
Oh, boys, oh, boys, is it it possible 1 
left old Ire-
land to come over to find a 
brother as black as the 
divil in America, but if that's the case 
soon 
pack up and disown relationship, but before I 
go 
gentlemen, I 
want to ask you 
SECOND CHoRDS. 
What's this country coming to 
Or what's a 
white man going to do, 
When a 
colored wench may marry your son, 
Or a 
baboon run away with your daughter

Now as I 
walked the Bowery down the other after-
noon. 
Where a young cirl followed by my side and 
asked me very soon,

Then I, quite shy, I 
made reply, yes I'm Pat Excel-

Though to tool me some would try, yet that does

For I 
am a

When working, what do you think, I 
used to spend 
my stamps in drink; 
But shnre I 
was so simple, gay and frisky, 
Some would take me by the hand, saying, come

'While I 
had the stamps they would help me 
drinking whiskey, 
Och hone, wirrasthrue I

But when I

By the ghost of Mad Moll, she was as hard

blow up Dublin. I 
could be on my solemn oath, 
that there wasn't an ounce of natural flesh on her 
ea case, except what she had en her hands, and 
that was unnatural, for you ,might as well get a

Pat's Farewell to Kathleen. 
Composed and sung by J. II. Ryan. 
Says Pat to Kathleen, I 
will lave yon, 
Though to me you have give ) great pain, 
Shure the divil a 
more harm I 
meant you, 
Nor the chaaging of your name. 
Shure if to that you consented 
Shute I'm as honest as ever was born, 
Arrah, the divil a 
day you'd repint it, 
For I'd comfort you, night, noon, and morn. 
CHORUS. 
Wirrasthrue I 
phillaloo, I'm kilt, 
May the quilt lie light on your delicate form, 
And the weather it's hot but my love when 'tis Lot. 
May it rowl you up cozy and warm. 
For a 
long t.me poor Pat thought her faithful, 
By that thought he was quite led astray, 
And shure, when he found her deceitful, 
Then from her he did gi away. 
And wh n 
on the ocean forsaken, 
Where he heard nothing hit the sform and wind, 
lie then t 
ought on the notion he'd taken, 
And the false one he had let far behind.

Now after a 
long voyage he landed. 
Forever he then bid her adieu, 
Far. far away then he wandered, 
Aye, for to seek one more true, 
But he hoped that she'd ask for forgiveness, 
Yes, and that he might b. near, 
Again for to cheer her in sadness, 
And through life to protect her from fear.

Although I'm old my heart's not cold

The rec tIlection now I

When our boys they were so joyful, 
And our girls would merrily sing; 
But now I'm growin.4 old, 
No such sights as those are seen, 
Our girls so gay, while the pipes would play 
Dancing on our village green.

Blow your bugle, beat 5-our drum, 
For the fighting day dii come. 
'Twas ihen each Irish mother's son, 
Turned out . or the Union army. 
(Dialogue.) 
CHORUS. 
Marrh, boys, march, with hearts so light and airy, 
Shout, boys, shout, for dear old Ti ,, perary, 
On, boys, on, united yet we'll stand, sir, 
Cheer, boys, cheer, for poor old Ireland. 
It was in the year eighteen sixty- ono, 
The cruel war it first be,un, 
At the first attack upon Boll Run, 
Where t 
ley deleated the Union army. 
Ave, but in eighteen sixty- lour, 
Paddy's sons they went once more, 
it wiva down the rebels flay they tore, 
And gave three cheers for Ir land. 
March, boys, etc. 
Th-n why de=pise poor Pat, chone, 
For if he itPd stopped at home, 
The North won d 
never have her own, 
From the rebel arzny. 
Aye, but th y 
came from near and far, 
To fight beneath the st-ir,e9. and stars, 
WhPn the brave Francis Meagher, 
Was a 
general in the army. 
(Dialogue.) 
March, boys, etc. 
Yol've all heard tell of little Mac, " 
With Sheridan ant Siegel at his back, 
And Sherman joined them in a 
crack, 
To fight for the Union army.

Miles O'Reilley I'll name to you 
He was a

so <tier, too, 
And General Mead you know was true, 
Unto the union army. 
March, boys, etc. 
Grant you know is number one, 
He is a 
see-nd Washington, 
For a 
great victory be wun, 
As a 
leader ot the army 
There's one we never can forget, 
His name is General Lafayette, 
And G •ore 'Washington, America's pet, 
Who made this tree and happy U. ion. • 
March, boys, etc. 
Tile Gutter Club. 
Composed by J. H. Ryan. Air—" Old Irish Gent." 
There's one thing all 
omic authors.have forgot, 
I 
h 
ve named it in my 1).11, 
It concerns the Gutt-r Parliament 
That meet on Michael's Hill. 
Each night they all as ,emble, 
At about half- past seven or eight, 
Alai do not seem to care a damn for an Or-
angeman, 
Or any magistrate. 
CHORUS. 
So tl at amongst these disehargrA warriors 
You'll find some of the real old ttyle. 
Each night as the big church clock 
trikes out the appointed hour, 
Then our aged old fogies 
From all parts of the city to the bill begin to 
pour.

We have a 
novel selection of fogies and waxeys, 
but one in particular, 
Wtio, in consequet.ce of being defea'ed. 
On ins po.itics tw ) nights betore. 
For the day fotlowing caunot partake of any 
g 
ub; 
For there is something most remarkably heavy 
on his mind 
To be argued at the Gutter Club. 
So that, etc. 
At night he rushes to the spot, 
First for a 
moment he will pause, 
And as be enters the crowd 
lie is greeted with applause. 
SPOKEN.— One young bla'guard remarks, " Hur-
rah, my old shoemaker," etc., etc. 
Thus interrupts the going on of politics, 
With his listeners' minds to fill, 
So that between himself and a 
couple of other 
old sh emakers 
They t 
aise the uevil's own sensation on the 
Hid. 
So , hat, etc. 
The Hill is for a 
moment silent, 
Proceeds he with his speech, 
Till at length near the main point 
He is beginning tor to 
each. 
To John M'chael's opinion on Fonianism, the 
Church Question, tae Alabama Claims, Na-
poleon lionaparte, 
And every other part of the world, 
THE IRISH 51100-FLY SONGSTER. 
He gives a 
gentle rub, 
that he is determined not to leave the Hill 
till he becumes the foremost poiiiiciaii o. the 
Gutter Club. 
So that, etc. 
In the mi 1st of this confusion 
his tongue he the.) lets loo ,e, 
About the noble days he spent at war 
He bgins to introduce. 
Willi this the crowd is getting quite disgusted, 
The night is growing late and chid, 
So all our brave- tongued patriots 
Slope away from Michael's Hill. 
So that, etc. 
So now kind friends my song is finished, 
I 
hope none here I 
did offend. 
I 
but told you how the night begins up there, 
And likewise how it does end. 
But on some future time, when you hear young 
Ryan, 
For a 
moment I 
may pause, 
And with what little I 
compose, 
Hope to gain your kind applause. 
CHORUS. 
So if any of you here be on for fun, 
I've told you where you'd get your fin. 
'Twou1.I be worth you while to spen t 
An hour or two at the Ga.ter aub on Mi-
chael's Hill. 
Why would the Prince of Wales, bad he been at a 
public school, have been the most thoroughly whip-
ped boy there ?—He would be wales from head to 
toot.

The Days when I was Young 
As sung by Harry Richmond. 
The other day, as I 
went out, 
A 
walking down the sire 
An old man, weak and leeble, too, 
I 
hal pened or to meet: 
And pausing as I 
passed him I 
y, 
Th ,su words tell nom his tongue; 
Oh I 
things ain't as they used to was, 
In the days when I 
was young. 
When I 
was young, the boys were boys, 
But, ah I 
that time is past; 
For, now they're men when once in pant.9 
And go it mighty fast; 
For with the gals they strut about, 
One on each arm hung— 
Oh I 
the boys ain't as they used to was, 
In the days when I 
was young. 
When I 
was young, low-salaried clerks 
Ne'er drove titer teams in style, 
Or, at races, on the fastest horse 
1 
hey never bet their pile, 
Nor, at Monte or the Faro- bank, 
Their dollars never flung : 
And they didn't have their whiskers dyed. 
In ihe dits when I 
was. young. 
When I 
was young the gals dressed plain, 
G od hoine-put ciothei they wore, 
They didn't used to spend their days 
In shopping at each store; 
They ne )er went out in monstrous hoops, 
Or i si.ks and diamonds hung ; 
And they hadn't invented waterfalls, 
In the days when I 
was young.

Together lived, of course ; 
And, every day, you did i't hear

When other lips and other hearts 
Their taes of love do tell,

Go out upon a

Left me a

And addei as he kicked me out,
