COM ING HOME FROM THE BALL. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. H. HARDING, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. 
H. 
HARDING, 233 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
THERE is no place so gay as the ball-room, 
When we are dancing in dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never greet us 
In the flash of the beautiful night ; 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasures we dearly adore, 
1
7. 
We must part from the scene so enchanting, 
And go home looking sleepy and sore. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, it's all very well to be waltzing, 
And the pleasures we love to recall, 
But you know how you feel in the morning, 
Coming home, coming home from the ball. 
There the ladies are rivals of Venus, 
And their smiles all around us do bestow, 
Every face wears a 
mantle of gladness, 
There is welcome wherever we go; 
But when morn comes around, we are weary, 
And we growl at the pain in our heads, 
And we think we are foolish for dancing 
When we should have been home in our beas. 
Oh, it's all, etc. 
All around us the music is floating, 
Light and gay as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
And we heed not the hours as they fly, 
Till the light peeping in through the window 
Makes us all bid each other good-bye. 
Oh, it's all, etc.

NEVER GO BACK ON THE POOR. 
AIR.—" 
Don't put your foot on a 
man when he's down" 
IN 
this world of sorrow, of toil and regret, 
There are scenes I 
would gladly pass o'er, 
But stern truth compels that each fact must be told, 
That thro' life we may check them the more. 
Is it right that a 
man who has \veil earned his pay 
On the pipes by the sweat of his brow, 
Should wait like a 
beggar content day by day, 
Or else home in hunger to go 1 
CHORE'S. 
If a 
man is in trouble, remember this song, 
Go drive the grim wolf from his door, 
Assist him in need, you will seldom be wrong, 
f 
you never go back on the poor. 
From the wild waste of waters a 
death-cry came, 
As dashed on the iron-bound shore, 
A 
noble ship struck in the darkness of night, 
And sank ' mid the tempest's loud roar, 
The captain asleep and the men off their posts, 
With the coal and provisions run short, 
While the doomed ones they hoped for that bright western 
land, 
Which in joyous sweet dreams they had sought. 
Can it be such neglect shall by us be forgot .1 
Or that money shall triumph once more? 
A 
good willing, hand a 
stout branch and a 
rope, 
For those who go back on the poor. 
(1)

NEVER GO BACK ON TT-TE POOR.—Continued. 
When the divers went down ' neath the wreck to search 
For the victims that lay far below, 
"'Tis only a 
steerage," was oft the remark, 
As the ghastly form came up to view. 
As if only a 
steerage could shut out a 
soul, 
Because poverty claimed him her own; 
As if dollars and dimes are the standard of worth, 
And the pass to all good that is known. 
CHORUS. 
But the White Star must change its emblem aloft, 
To blood- red, afloat and ashore, 
Till the steamer Atlantic's forgotten by time, 
With its cargo of unburied poor. 
At the stands on the corner of every street, 
The aged and the blind used to be, 
And work out a 
living to save them from want, 
From the poor-house that they might be free. 
But now, stout Italians, healthy and strong, 
Each old grandmother's driven away ; 
I 
don't think the people will stand the base wrong, 
Of these people who work under pay. 
And the newsboy or bootblack that toils morn and night 
To keep hunger and pain from the door 
Have been pushed to the wall by these great organ men, 
Let us never go hack on the poor.

THE OLD ENGLISH SQ UIRE. 
By 
R. 
STEIRLY. 
The Music of this Song is published by E. 
II. 
HATZDING, 288 Bowery. 
Price 10 Cents. 
About fifty years ago when George the Third was Tiling, 
The Prince the star of fashion, hiightly shun'' i.. pleasures ring ; 
Liy'd a 
good old English Squire, a 
man of great renown, 
he'd an old hail in the Country, and a 
modern house in town . 
A 
justice of the peace he was and also an M P., 
\Vas tetter'd to no pa- ty. in his principles was free ; 
He courted not the Premier, his sons were in the Guards, 
With Fox he sometimes voted, but much ofrner play'd at Cards. 
He kept a 
stud of racers, ' twas his joy to see them run, 
His side boards were well cover'd with the Gold cups they had won 
To the town he represented ev'ry year he gave a 
plate, 
And to the course in coach and six he always drove in state. 
Six goodly na ,rs they were forsooth, tho' very fat and slow, 
Their mattes well deck'd with ribbons and their flowing tails also; 
His lady sat beside him, tall and upright as a- wand, 
The people loudly cheer' d 
them as they lighted at the stand. 
He kept a 
pack of fox bounds of the pure old English breed, 
Right musical and staunch they were.tho' not much fam'd for speed ; 
His hunters were enduring, and could go a 
decent pace, 
To suit his hounds he bred them, not to ran a 
steeple chase. 
Ile boldly dash'd o'er hec'hre and ditch, nor stood at gate or brook 4 1 
.And many a 
Melton Mow 
bray swell would shy the leaps he took ; 
'Twas 
pleasant sight to see hint thro' a 
bound fence make a 
gap, 
With his hair just like a 
drum stick, sticking out behind his Cap. 
On the first day of September, as the season it came round, 
The Squire in the stubble, with his pointers might be found; 
His gun was like a 
musket, an old fashioned flint and steel, 
Wide muzzled and a 
kicker, she was heavy in the heel. 
But birds they befit 
plentiful, lie brought down many a 
brace, 
And if be caught them sitting he showed them little grace ; 
Talk of shooting flying, about fifty years ago, 
Kill when you can was then the plan but trust to shooting low. 
His rent day was at Michaelmas, beneath the old oilc Hall, 
Where portraits, arms,and horns of deer bedeck'd each panerd wao., 
'Twas his Custom and a 
good one, with his tenantry to dine. 
And the first toast that he gave, was in a 
gold cup 
with wine. 
Old claret rich and spark hit g. such as seldom tasted now, 
'Twas the King. and Royal Family and Goa speed the plough ; 
Amen: exclaimed the V car, his patron seated near, 
The Farmers drank their bumpels off and gave a 
hearty cheer. 
About thirty years ago, the time I 
wt- 11 remember 
A dark and dreary day in the c‘dd month of -November ; 
This good old Country Squire, aged three score years and ten, 
Was ga her'd to ins Fathers, to the grief of all good men. 
In the village Church he's buried. scarce a 
mile from the old Hall, 
His heir he was chief mourner, six old neighbors bore his pall ; 
His memory still is cherished and many people say. 
With this good old Country Squire good old times have pass'd away.

THE REFORMER ON THE SLY. 
Revised and Sang by JOHNNY Mum 
with great success. 
Good people all, take my advice, and listen unto me, 
But don't put too much confidence in every man you see, 
They say, fine feathers make fine birds, but not go every one, 
For men will often wear broadcloth, to hide their little game, 
But whether they are fish or fowl it makes no difference to 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
reformer on the sly. 
There are fifty kinds of swindling-
mills in the papers every day, 
And lotteries where you draw a 
farm (God knows how far away.) 
There's politicians now-a•days that at public expense, 
They rob our city government and leave it not worth a 
cent, 
I 
wish for once I 
was a 
Judge, and had those thieves to try, 
They'd get sent up and polished off, by a 
reformer on the sly. 
There's Madam Morris, from Corsica, who with her telescope, 
Your future wife or husband shows. 
Good gracious that's a 
joke, 
If you give to her but fifty cents, she'll send you a 
card by mail, 
I 
think they ought to find her a 
home, six months in the county 
jail. 
There's the seventh daughter of the seventh son to swindle you. 
they'll try, 
But I 
know their little euchre game, I'm a 
reformer on the sly, 
?n Chatham street, the other day I 
took a 
walk along, 
I 
heard a 
fellow crying out, going, going, gone. 
Who bids for it, this fine gold watch, the finest ever seen, 
he thought I 
was a 
little flat-1 
erhaps a 
little green— 
I 
says, excuse me, please, if I 
wink so with my eye, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, Fin a 
reformer on the sly.

BRIGADIER BRANIGAN. 
W HEN I 
was a 
single young man, the girls they all tried to 
please me; 
To be merry was always my plan, for devil a 
thing could tease 
me; 
I 
was always merry and gay, how I 
jigged it with Judy O'Ca-
lagan. 
Until, like a 
poor ninny one day, I 'listed with Brigadier Bra-
n 
gan. 
SPOKEN.—The Brigadier was a 
tall, slim man, about six feet 
five, and as fine a 
looking man as you'd meet in a 
day's walk— — 
people used to take me for the Brigadier.—He used to come in-
to my mother's shebeen-shop every morning for a 
noggin of whis-
key, and he'd talk to me about the battles he was in and the 
battles he wasn't in ; about the Generals he killed and the Gen-
erals that killed him, until he had me as full of military ardor 
as an egg is full of 
meat. 
One morning he said to me, 
" 
Paddy," said he, " will you take a 
snilling's farth 7" 
Said I, 
" 
I 
will, for I'm dead broke this minute." " Oh," said he, " you 
don't understand me, the Queen wants men." " Well," said I, " I 
know plenty of women that want men, besides the Queen." " No, 
no, that's not what I 
mean," said he, " will you list 7" " I 
don't 
mind if I 
do," said I. 
So I 
donned the regimentals and off I 
started to his 
CHORUS. 
Rub a 
dub dub, a 
dub, doo whack fa Iar a 
ladidy, 
Rub a 
dub dub, a 
dub, doo whack fa lar a 
ladidy. 
Soon we were marching away, and over the fields I 
was footing 
it ; 
But something told me all the day, arrab, Paddy, you're put-
ting your foot in it; 
°eh, hone, how the girls they did cry, especially Judy O'Cala-
g,an; 
Who I 
left with a 
tear in my eye, to go marching with Briga-
dier Branigan. 
SPOK EN. — We were all drawn up in rasp and file—or rank and 
file as the Brigadier called it. 
One tine morning I 
walked over 
to him as polite as you please. " Good morning, your honor," 
said I ; 
would you be after taking a 
drop of the creater this 
morning ?" " I 
don't mind if I 
do," said he, so over the road 
(1) 
BRIGADIER BRANIGAN.— Continued. 
we started to a 
shebeen-shop and I 
called for a 
half pint. I 
was 
pouring out a 
noggin for him, when he grabbed the mu ,' 
out of 
my hand. " Hould on, Paddy, me boy," said he ; " discipline 
among the men. 
The private3 are never allowed to drink while 
the officers are around." 
lie put the mug to his mouth and 
divil a 
sup he left for poor me. " Fall in !" he cried. " Arrah, 
we'll not, fall out," said I. " Stand at ase I" " How can I 
when 
there's a 
big cobble stone under my right foot 1" " Forward, 
march !" 
I 
didn't execute the order quick enough, he drew 
his sword and hit me with the flat of it across the hip, which 
made me limp off to his 
Rub a 
dub, etc. 
Soon into battle we went, where the bullets where shooting and 
flying sure; 
Where many a 
poor fellow lay killed and many another lay 
dying sure; 
A 
bombshell came flying o'er me, I 
was thinking of Judy O'Ca-
lagan; 
With the Brigadier's head it made free, faith it finished Briga-
dier Branigan. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, there we stood, Murphy on one side, I 
on the 
-other and the Brigadier in the middle, when along came a 
bomb-
shell taking the head clean off the Brigadier. " Hurrah !" 
cried Murphy, raising his hand. " We're free at last!" when 
along came another bombshell, taking the hand right off of 
Murphy. " Arrah !" cried Murphy, " I've lost me hand! I've 
lost me hand !" " Hould your gab, you black- guard," said I, 
" 
there's the Brigadier has lost his head, and divil a 
word he 
says about it." 
I 
went over to where he was lying. " Are you kilt 7" said I 
fie didn't condescend to speak to me. " If you have any request 
to make," said I, " if you tell me what it is, I 
will do it for you." 
" 
Paddy," said he, " Pm not kilt, but Pm murdered, and spach-
, 
less, and if you have any regards for me, you'll be after going 
over the field and looking for my head, place it on my should-
ers, and see me buried dacently." " I'll do that same," said I. 
So over the field I 
went, looking for his head; at last I 
came to 
it. trying to roll over to a 
canteen full of whiskey. 
I 
knew it was his head, for he had a 
big pimple on the side 
of his nose. I

LA DE DA DE SWELL. 
As sung by BILLY BENNETT. 
I FAILED three times in horseflesh, 
Got bottled up in wine; 
I 
came to grief in that black trade, 
Cold liquors run divine ; 
My bubble companies wouldn't float, 
My patent rat- traps sell, 
So I 
all at once gave up the ghost, 
And behold a 
howling swell. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I'm the swell of Piccadilly, with my hair of piccalily, 
And a 
large estate in Chili, and that's the style you see; — 
There's many a 
foolish filly and sentimental silly, 
Says you're the man for Billy, and he is the man for me; 
Smash, crash, driving down pell mell; 
Stand aside, you fellow, for I'm a 
howling swell, 
I'm a 
la de da de swell, and I 
don't mind telling you, 
I'm a 
la de da de swell, with my la de da de do. 
I 
went down town the other day, 
With a 
friend of mine to dine ; 
We dined off splendid fishes, 
And most delightful wine ; 
That sort of thing it suits me, 
I 
like that living well ; 
But he didn't know he had the honor 
To be dining with a 
swell. 
SPOKEN.—No, I 
can assure, he didn't know he had so distin-
guished an honor as to be dining with the— 
Swell of Piccadilly, etc. 
We went down town together, 
In a 
quiet sort of way; 
'Twas most delightful weather, 
Up and down Broadway; 
I 
stepped into a 
jeweller's, 
A 
lady's hair to deck ; 
Dear me, it's after banking hours, 
But I 
can draw a 
check. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and he would only be too happy to receive a 
check from so renowned a 
person as — 
The swell of Piccadilly, etc.

I'M what you call a

If you doubt me, I

I 
stand just six foot two, " sans " a 
stocking or a

And a 
finer soldier you will never scan. 
CHORUS. 
To a " right shoulder shift," my musket I 
will lift, 
And all the pretty faces I 
will scan, oh, 
When the band does sweetly play, we will march, march' away, 
For I'm what you call a 
military man. 
Whenever I 
go out upon parade, 
I 
awaken in the breast of every maid, 
A 
feeling they admire, for I set their heart on fire, 
And of military men, they're not afraid. 
To a " right shoulder shift," etc. 
When they see me marching proudly down Broadway, 
They look at one another, and they say, 
" 
Oh, what a 
splendid man, just look at him, Mary Ann, 
I 
can't resist his military way." 
To a " right shoulder shift," etc. 
Where'ere I 
go I 
greatly am admired, 
And with such martial feeling Pm inspired, 
That the ladies all assert that with me they'd rather flirt, 
For of military men they're never tired.

My constituents they all go there, 
To enjoy the summer's recreation, 
And the refreshing East river air ; 
I'm known in Harlem, I'm known in Jarsey, 
I'm welcomed hearty on every hand; 
Wid my regalia on Patrick's day, 
I 
march away like a

YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL THE 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
When a 
child I 
lived at Flushing with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of childish play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mother say; 
CHORUS. 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
Let your watch-word be despatch and practice what you preach, 
Do not let your c 
hances like sunbeams pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seemed my only sport it was my only joy, 
And well do I 
remember when °filmes well chastised, 
How father sat beside me, and thus has me advised; 
Waste not, want not, &c. 
When I 
arrived at manhood I 
embarked in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road, bestrewn with care and strife, 
I 
speculated foolishly, my losses were severe, 
But still a 
little voice kept whispering in my ear. 
Waste not, want not, & c. 
Then I 
studied strict economy and found to my surprise, 
My funds instead of & liking very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasped each chance and always struck the iron while twas hot, 
1 
seized my opportunities and never once forgot: 
Waste no, want not, & c. 
m-rrie 1 
now and happy, I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony devoid of care and strife, 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have Ii tie children three, 
The lesson that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee; 
Waste not, want not, & c.

Behold in me a 
wretched man, quite broken down by woe, 
I've lost my wife and cannot find her anywhere I 
go ; 
At first she robbed me of my heart and now she's flown 
from me, 
And taken all my furniture, wherever can she be ? 
Perhaps she's on the railway, with a 
swell so fair,— 
Perhaps she's up in a 
balloon, flying thro' the air; 
Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive. perhaps she's on the sea ; 
Perhaps she's gone to Brigham Young, a 
Mormonite to be. 
She read so much of Mormonites, of nothing else she'd 
talk, 
And with a 
sanctified young chap each day she used to 
walk; 
She said he was a 
Mormon saint from far across the sea. 
1 
have not seen her for a 
week, wherever can she be? 
Perhaps she's, & c. 
She can't respect the marriage vows, that faithfully she 
swore, 
only hope her Mormon spouse has fifty wives or more ; 
I 
hope he'll thrash her every night when he comes home 
to tea, 
I 
hope they'll always row and fight wherever they may be. 
Perhaps she's, (te. 
1 
hope she'll have a 
lot of hungry, squalling, brats to keep, 
I 
hope they'll cry all night, and never let her go to sleep ; 
I 
hope her chimneys all may smoke, her lodgers never pay, 
And German bands and organ men annoy her all the day 
Perhaps she's, &-.
e. 
It she is in the railway train, I 
hope that it will smash ; 
If up in a 
balloon, I 
hope she'll fall out with a 
crash ; 
If on the road to Salt Lake, then, I 
hope she may get 
drowned, 
Then I 
will get another wife and quickly I'll be bound.

She say, my dear don't fret, 
She look that vay I

Her nose vas blue, and turned up too, 
Tier hair so red hung down, 
Her foot vas big as a

She's de peautifullest gal in town. 
I ask her if she valk mit me, 
And have some lager bier, 
She told me she vould happy be, 
And said I

And as quick as we got in, 
She bawled right out on de top of her voice,

MISS YOU, DEAR. 
You don't know how we miss you, dear, 
how long the days now seem, 
Our once contented, happy home 
Seems like a 
faded dream ; 
Your dear old father all the day 
Does nothing else but mourn, 
At night he dreams you home again, 
But wakes to find you gone. 
CHORUS. 
But again we hope to meet you, 
When the trials of life are o'er, 
Oh, how fondly we will greet you, 
When we meet to part ro more. 
Your mother—oh, if you could see 
how gray her locks have grown, 
how deep the care marks on her brow, 
how sad- like is her tone; 
We try sometimes to comfort her, 
But only try in vain, 
She sweetly smiles, but quickly then 
The tears come back again 
But again we hope, etc.

LITTLE SWEETHEART, COME AND KISS ME.

THE BUGABOO. 
As Sung by JERIZY BARRINGTON. 
COME all ye tender-hearted boys, wherever you may be, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardships, my boys, 
that I went 
throuffh,* 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys, on board of the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
The day when first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal : 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never 
shall : 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plough the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of Richmond barracks so 
true,* 
When the gallant 84th fired a 
royal salute of bricks at the cap-
tain of the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We sailed three years when a storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark blue 
sky, 
So the second mate gave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—he set 
fire to the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When the captain found what he had done, he loud for help did 
shout, 
lie called up through the chimney- top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out ; 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so hard through the middle of the turf, 
they couldn't save the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When fifteen thousand miles from land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so hard one night, that it couldn't burn any-
more ; 
So the captain he gave orders to lower the boats and save the 
crew,* 
While 1,000 rods of turf and 50,000 men were smothered in the 
Bugaboo.

We may never roam together

LIFE'S journey's a 
path full of briers and thorns, 
We must trudge it on foot, boys together; 
The rough and the smooth, The calm and the storm, 
We must face it no matter the weather; 
It is folly to grieve for the joys that are past, 
Our troubles a 
lesson will give ; 
So courage, my lads, with strong hearts and true, 
We will sing, " while we live, let us live." 
CH ORUS . 
The adage tho' old is a 
good one to give, 
" 
In this world while we live, let us live, let us live," 
" 
In this world while we live, let us live." 
The miser a 
crusty old knave with his pelf, 
The rich in their carriage and four, 
Are not half as happy as you are, my friends, 
If you've got health and strength though you're poor. 
Then to grumble ' gainst fate, is a 
sin and a 
shame, 
But thank God for blessings He'll give ; 
Throw care to the winds, be staunch to the core, 
And then sing, " While we live, let us live." 
The adage, etc. 
There are those in the world that are poorer than us, 
Struggling hard with it's turmoils and strife ; 
Then hold out your hand, and help them to mount 
A 
round in the ladder of life. 
The mite thou;lt but small, will reap its reward, 
If you've enemies freely forgive ; 
With envy to no man, and good will to all, 
You can sing, " While we live, let us live."

Innisfallen's ruined shrine 
May suggest a 
passing sigh ; 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by. 
Castle Lough and Glenn Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagles' Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span: 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints ; 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries doff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair: 
Beauty's home, Killarney 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstasy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud-wreaths in that sky 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine ; 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

BEAUTIFUL GIRLS. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
THEY talk about their foreign girls, 
How beautiful they are, 
And how they dress, and all that thing, 
But for that I 
don't care; 
The girls I 
love are Yankee girls; 
I 
see them every thy ; 
They're plain, I 
own, but then they have 
A 
nice and winning way. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, indeed. 
I 
needn't go out of the United States 
to find— 
CHORUS.—Beautiful girls, beautiful girls, 
Saucy, teasing, pleasing girls ; 
I 
love one and all, both great and small, 
Beautiful, beautiful girls. 
It's nice, when it is winter time, 
To go upon the road 
In a 
nice sleigh, a 
pretty girl 
'Long side of you is stowed; 
And how the people they will look, 
And wonder who she is; 
But you drive on, and never mind, 
Because it's not their " biz." 
SPOKEN.—It's the nicest thing in winter to have a 
pretty girl 
out sleighing. 
You stop at a 
hotel, and ask her what she will 
have to drink. 
She says ( very meekly), " Wine." ‘• What 
kind — port or sherry ?" 
She says, " Champagne." 
Now, ini-
ac,ine treating to champagne and only a 
dollar in you pocket— 
and that always happens when you take out riding— 
Beautiful girls, etc. 
And when the summer comes around, 
To pic-nics you do go, 
And to enjoy yourself, while there, 
You ask along your beau. 
The day is fine, the music, too, 
And birds sing from each tree, 
And with a 
charming, nice young girl, 
How happy one must be ! 
SPOKEN.—At a pic-nic a 
man can always enjoy himself, if he 
has a 
pretty aid with him. 
How nice it is to eat lunch with 
her that. she has prepared with her delicate hands! 
How nice 
it is to get into a 
swing with her, and then to wander off in the 
woods alone ! 
You (Yet on your knees, and tell her you will 
love her as long as life lasts, and ask her to be your wife. 
She 
consents. 
You then get up, and find a 
lot of mud and oyster-
shells all over your knees; and all that comes fsom making 
love to— 
Beautiful girls, etc.

DARLING BESSIE OF THE LEA. 
By HENRY TUCKER. 
OH 
! I wander 'mid the roses in the golden summer time, 
And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime ; 
But far sweeter than the roses and the streamlet unto me, 
Is the sunlit face of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
CHORUS. 
She is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
Pure and gentle as an angel, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
She is my star and treasure, darling Bessie of the lea. 
Not a 
bird in the wild wood but will answer to her call, 
Oh ! most I 
love the twilight when the pearly dew-drops fall, 
Then she meets me in the valley and she kindly welcomes me, 
My bonnie star of evening, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, etc. 
Oh ! the honey bee may linger where the buds and blossoms 
grow, 
The r
,entle breeze of summer in its fragrance come and go, 
But they ill will pass unheeded, for wherever she may be, 
My heart is full of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, etc.

BEAUTIFUL LOVE. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
LOVE, love, oh, what is love l 
love, ' tis that makes man feel so 
peculiar: 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud, a Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia 7 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round and 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the first attack it's like raspberry jam, running 
down ones back. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, love it is that makes a 
man feel so pecu 
liar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man's but a 
fool when he falls in love. 
Oh, love, when you're in love, to presents, to parties and picnics 
you treat her, 
Oh, love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel just as tho' you'd 
like to eat her; 
But the best of loves must part—then an end comes to your 
bliss, 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the 
parting kiss. 
You bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
Oh, love, etc. 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning yourself 
in cold water; 
If it's all right she'll giggle and say, please ask father if I 
may,

Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a

When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked- for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beautiful twins.

IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU FEEL THAT WAY. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
SHAN'T forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
CHORUS, 
I 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled into ho 
all their money 
The feeling's 
• 
so peculiar and funny, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
ney, and some one had left me 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the ices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
We met again 9ue afternoon, and as we were alone, 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own; 
She blushed and said, go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
The old man said that we might wed and so he crowned our 
bl iss, 
Anil I 
shall he a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass away, 
I 
long to hear those wedding bells, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt ag tho', etc.

GOOD EVENING. 
I 
had been dining rather late, 
The fact I 
think it best to state, 
When I 
strolled out without a 
mate, 
One very pleasant evening; 
On fancies bent my steps were led, 
As onward through the streets I 
strayed, 
A 
lovely figure I 
saw ahead, 
Walked past and said, " Good-evening." 
I 
felt a 
disappointed dunce, 
Not a 
word she answered in response, 
Though I 
repeated more than once, 
" 
Good-evening, Miss, good-evening." 
At length she turned het: head this way, 
And you can judge of my dismay, 
She was fifty-five if she was a 
day, 
And of course I 
said " Good-evening." 
My disappointment made me queer, 
I 
stepped into an ale-house near, 
Addressed the bar-maid thus : " My dear, 
A glass of ale—good-evening." 
With sparkling eyes she an ale soon served, 
What is makes me so unnerved ?" 
Close standing by me I 
observed 
My tailor, sir 
Good-evening. 
His presence spoiled my wish to stay, 
I 
reachzd the door, then heard her say, 
" 
Please pay before you go away, 
Ten cents, sir, then good-evening." 
" 
Pray, pardon, Miss, I 
beg of you. 
I 
quite forgot," (and that was true.) 
The tailor says, " You often do ; 
Good- evening, Snuze, good-evening." 
THE GIRL WHAT I CALLS MINE.

in 
the bank For the girl what I calls mine. 
Now where she lives, and what's her name, 
I 
don't intend to tell, 
For certain sure she'd soon be quizzed 
By every noble swell; 
You may see me on a 
Sunday, if 
The weather it is fine, 
As I 
takes my walk, and on my arm, 
Is the girl what I 
calls " mine."—Cno. 
There's servant-maids, and other maids, 
What's dealers at my store, 
They winks their eye, so I 
winks mine, 
In fun—but nothing more; 
if a 
duchess wished to marry me, 
I'd beg leave to decline, 
I'd rather live on bread and cheese, 
With the girl what I 
calls mine.—Cao. 
Twas on last Sunday afternoon, 
I 
plucked up nerve to pop, 
The question, if she'd have me, and 
My wegebles and shop. 
She didn't say " no," she didn't say " yes," 
But she said she'd " drop a 
line," 
'Cause so very bashful and so shy, 
Is the girl what I 
calls mine. 
SroEEN.—I do believe she'd blush herself to death if anybody'd 
let her; but it's a 
ton of coals to a 
pint of gooseberries she answers 
"yes"; so if the wegebles should go up a 
penny or so, it will be 
owing to the matrimonial speculation of this " umble hindiwiddle"

hoppersite sect, of which as I said

I WISH MAMMA WAS HERE. 
The Musk of this Song is published by White & Goldlard, 86 Tremont 
Street, Boston, Mass. 
Price 35 cents. 
Sung with immense applause by TONY r ASTON.. 
A 
TINY, pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say, 
"Now papa, you kiss me." 
The father pressed his darling child, 
And smoothed his silken hair, 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here !" 
'I wish mamma was here ! 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
A 
tear rolled down the father's cheek, 
lie pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh ; 
He bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the fallincr tear, 
And Willie murmured in his sleep, 
"I wish mamma was here !" 
" 
I 
wish mamma," etc. 
His darling pined that very night, 
Until the turn of tide, 
The angel death was near him then, 
At early (lawn he died. 
The father cried in wild despair, 
" 
Oh! live, my darling- dear !" 
And Willie breathed his last fcnd sigh, 
"I know mamma is here !" 
"I wish mamma," etc.

I WANT TO GO HOME TO MAMMA. 
Written and Composed by F. 
W . 
EGERTON. 
Sung by M IES JENNIE ENGEL. 
I 
once had a 
sweetheart—tho' her name was Brown, 
She was most decidedly green, 
But when you have seen her, you'll say she's as nice 
A young lady as ever was seen; 
And then she's so tunny, she's just like a 
child. 
She loy'd me, but much better far, 
She lov'd her dear parents for always she cried, 
I 
want to go home to Mamma. 
cnonus. 
I 
want to go home to Mamma, 
I 
want to go home to Mamma, 
" 
It's naughty" I 
say " to keep me away, 
When I 
want to go home to Mamma." 
When first I 
beheld her, I 
thought what a 
dear, 
With joy, oh ! I 
nearly went wild, 
But when I 
began, to boo and to coo, 
Why she snivelled out like a 
child ; 
I 
thought she was ill, I 
could not make her out, 
%V hen she jumped up and said, " Oh tat-ta." 
I 
said " pray don't go," when she cried out, " Oh I 
I 
want to go home to Mamma." 
I 
want to go home, &c, 
With lots of persuasion, and coaxing, and fuss, 
The worst job I've had in my life, 
contrived to assure her I 
loved her so much, 
Till she said " that she'd be my wile ;" 
We drove to the church, when oh, what a 
scene! 
She would have the door left ajar, 
The clergyman said, " Will you wed," she shrieked out-
-,"No, 
I 
want to go home to Mamma l" 
I 
want to go home, 66c. 
At last we were married, Oh ! my, what a 
job, 
To the continent then off we went. 
I'm happy to say, she her nervousness lost, 
When the honeymoon cosey we spent. 
So now she's so derent to what she once was, 
We're happy by night and by day, 
Her marriage she says " she will never repent." 
And never do I 
hear her say, 
I 
want to go home, &a 
THE INCREASE OF THIRST. 
Ant.—" Crime." 
I'VE been drinking of late, I've been drinking— 
And the fact I 
can scarcely deny— 
I've been drinking hot gin and rum-punches, 
But now I'm obliged to go dry! 
Cries the man at the bar : " You're a 
bummer, 
You're something I 
can't understand; 
You've worked like a 
man all the summer, 
And still you've no scrip in your hand. 
It is true you are cheeky and bold, sir, 
All the rum I 
have got you could hold, sir ; 
You could drink a 
whole barrel, I'm told, sir— 
Can you wonder the reason you're dry 1" 
It is true what you say, Mr. Landlord, 
I 
ought to have scrip laid away— 
A 
great plenty to go on a 
bust, sir, 
And drink cocktails all night and all day ; 
But you are like a 
dog in the manger, 
You might treat me, would you but try, 
But to bummers you act like a 
stranger ; 
Can you wonder the reason I'm dry 1 
For my thirst you don't care a 
thing, sir, 
For the rich man you'll make a 
gin- sling, sir, 
While I 
for my beverage must sing, sir— 
Can you wonder that sometimes I'm dry'? 
'Tis true what you say, Mr Landlord, 
Good liquor is bard to resist ; 
Just look at that poor drunken rounder— 
Few drinks, God knows, he has missed ; 
Can you wonder at his weak constitution, 
When he drinks every time that he's asked ? 
(1) 
THE INCREASE OF THIRST.—Continued. 
Soon he'll go to that great institution, 
To the State Farm he'll stagger at last. 
There's his poor wife at home, God defend her ! 
With children whose years are quite tender. 
All the bread that they get kind friends send her— 
Can you wonder they're hungry and dry ? 
Can you wonder I'm dry, can you wonder, 
When there's so many like me on the beat, 
So many poor thirsty creatures, 
Who would much rather drink than to eat ? 
There's a 
rounder in the corner sits grinning 
In the broad open light of the night— 
In my pockets I've not got a 
shilling, 
Or we'd both be exceedingly tight; 
lIe smiles with contempt and derision, 
A 
hot whiskey punch meets his vision, 
But the price of good liquor has risen, 
And still we are forced to go dry. 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
That I'm not too proud to drink rum ; 
While the drinks that you take can't be counted, 
'Tis a 
godsend for me to get one! 
Go visit the places that I 
take in ; 
Such sights you will never behold. 
When a 
man's broke, his friends all forsake him, 
Though his heart may be made of pure gold! 
While one drink would soon break asunder 
The thirst this poor sufferer is under ; 
Hear me plead with a 
voice loud as thunder; 
Oh! why will you let me go dry ?

THE OLD KITCIIEN PLOOR.—[CONCLUDED ] 
I 
remember the fire-place with mouth high and wide, 
The old-fashioned oven that stood by its side, 
Out of which, each Thanksgiving, came puddings and pies, 
That fairly bewildered and dazzled my eyes. 
And then, too, Saint Nicholas, slyly and still, 
Came down every Christmas, our stockings to fill. 
But the dearest of mein'ties I've laid up in store, 
Is the mother that trod on that old kitchen floor. 
Cho.-0 
the old kitchen floor, &c. 
Day in and day out, and from morning till night, 
Tier footsteps were busy, her heart always light; 
For it seemed to me then, that she knew not a 
care, 
The smile was so gentle her face used to wear. 
I 
remember with pleasure what joy filled our eyes, 
When she told us the stories that children so prize; 
They were new ev'ry night, though we'd beard them before, 
From her lips, at the wheel, on the old kitchen floor. 
Cho.-0 
the old kitchen floor, &c. 
To- night those old visions come back at their will, 
But the wheel and its music forever are still ; 
The band is moth-eaten, the wheel laid away, 
And the fingers that turned it lie mould'ring to clay; 
The hearthstone, so sacred, is just as ' twas then, 
And the voices of children ring out there again; 
The sun through the window looks in as of yore, 
But it sees stranger feet on the old kitchen floor. 
Cho.-0 
the old kitchen floor, &c. 
I 
ask not for honor, but this I 
would crave, 
That, when the lips speaking are closed in the grave, 
My children will gather their own at their side, 
And tell of the mother who long ago died. 
'Twould be more enduring, far dearer to me, 
Than inscription on marble or granite could be, 
To have them tell often, as I 
did of yore, 
Of the mother who trod on the old kitchen floor.

JENNY WHO LIVES IN THE DELL 
Oh the fairies have not all departed, 
And bid this dull planet adieu ; 
For, I 
know a 
maid gentle- hearted, 
With eyes that are tender and blue, 
You'd take, in a 
moment, to be one; 
She weaves in all bosoms a 
spell; 
So, if you are longing to see one, 
It's Jenny who lives in the dell. 
CHORUS. 
Jenny who lives in the dell, 
Jenny who lives in the dell, 
There is no maid so bright and so bonny, 
As 
Jenny who lives in the dell. 
Oh I 
I'm sighing wherever I 
wander, 
My 
heart has been stolen away; 
On 
nothing at all do I 
ponder, 
But Jenny's fair face, all the day. 
But she sings as blithesome as ever. 
And knows that I 
love her so well: 
For, love in his roving, has never 
Found Jenny who lives in the dell, 
Jenny who lives, &ie.

"KEEP TO THE RIGHT.* 
Words by HARRY LINN. 
Music by ROLAND HOWARD., 
One day while walking thro' the streets, amidst a 
busy throng. 
Studying and musing on a 
subject for my song, 
A board 'laird to a 
corner, it quickly caught my sight. 
And painted there I 
saw the warning, " Keep to the right," 
CHORUS. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, shun whate'er is wrong, 
Then upon life's billows you'll go merrily along. 
Be honest in your dealings, morning, noon, and night, 
And let your watchword always be, boys, keep to the right. 
Keep a 
smiling countenance, never wear a 
frown, 
Do not try to raise yourself by pulling others down, 
Envy not your neighbor, ne'er indulge in spite. 
Malice brings unhappiness, so keep to the right. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, &c. 
Be sober and industrious, ambitions to get on, 
For in 
unequal battle you must struggle hard and strong, 
In gossiping or meddling, never twie delight, 
Always mind your own atrairs. and keep to the right. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, Sze. 
Keep to the right then, how happy you will be, 
Your heart will be as light as air, your conscience pure and free, 
Behind the darkest cloud, the sun is always shining bright, 
Prosperity will crown you if you keep to the right. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, &c.

MY BARNEY. 
Written for and sung by Miss TostE Meatus, in the " Grand Hiberniea." 
Ant.—" Teddy McGlynn." 
MY 
name pon me honor is Kitty O'Connor, 
And I 
live near the city of Dublin so grand; 
My lover's name's Barney, he's tipped wid the blarney, 
And his car any day you can see on the stand. 
As he drives thro' the street, sure you niver can meet 
Another wid such a 
sweet blarneying smile ; 
Himself is a 
picture so trim and so neat, sir, 
And he is the boy that my heart does beguile. 
My Barney the guide, ' tis he is my pride, 
And he is the boy that'll make me his bride. 
In ructions and fighting he takes a 
delight in, 
A 
jolly good shindy it fills him wid glee, 
And sometimes a 
drop of " the cratur" he'll sup, 
He drinks nothing stronger than whiskey, d'ye see. 
A 
long time we've tarried and soon we'll get married; 
And won't I 
be proud when I 
sit by his side, 
All dressed in my best, wid silks and the rest, 
As I 
leap on his car and to church we will ride. 
Me and Barney the guide, my joy and my pride, 
'Tis he is the boy that'll make me his bride. 
LIMERICK IS BEAUTIFUL. 
As sung in the " Grand Hiberniea." 
OH, Limerick it is beautiful, as everybody knows, 
The River Shannon full of fish beside that city flows; 
'Tis not the river nor the fish that weighs upon me mind, 
Nor with the town of Limerick I've any fault to find. 
Oh, the girl I 
love is beautiful, she's bright-eyed as the fawn, 
She lives at Garryowen, and she's called the Colleen Bawn; 
And proudly as that river flows beside that great city, 
Still prouder and without a 
smile that colleen goes by me. 
Oh, hone! oh, hone! 
Oh, Limerick, it is beautiful, as everybody knows. 
Oh, if I 
was the Emperor of Russia to command, 
Or Julius Cxsar, or the Lord Lieutenant of the land, 
I'd give me goold and silverplate, likewise me army, 
The horse guards, the rifles, and the royal artillery ; 
I'd give the crown of my head, me people on their knee, 
I'd give me fleet of sailing ships upon the briny sea; 
A 
beggar, I 
would go to rest to rise at early dawn, 
If by me side, just as a 
bride, I'd find the Colleen Bawn. 
Oh, hone! oh, hone! 
Oh Limerick it is beautiful, as everybody knows.

OYSTERS AND WINE AT 2 A. M. 
I'm a 
maiden who never refuses, 
The pleasures that come in my way, 
For now is the time to be merry, 
To be bashful is but to delay; 
When the stars far above us are shining, 
With a 
party of friends, but a 
few, 
Quick the night passes by and we finish, 
With oysters and wine at 1 
CHORUS. 
Oysters and wine at 2

Oysters and wine at 2 
A. it., oysters and wine at 2. 
Now a 
journey to Long Branch is pleasant, 
Oh ! yes, ' tis delightful to me, 
f,4 
We stroll on the beach in the moonlight, 
When the wild waves are roaring with glee; 
Oh! but give me a 
partner for dancing, 
And sweet music to ' liven us too, 
While we whisper " good-night," and then finish 
With oysters and wine at 2. 
Oysters and wine, etc. 
Thro' this wide world where we now are roaming, 
Life calls for excitement and fun, 
So why should we sigh, or feel gloomy, 
For too soon will life's pleasures be done; 
So then let us be merry while living, 
For it never will do to look blue, 
But still cling to the pleasures delightful, 
And oysters and wine at 2. 
Oysters and wine, etc.

FIRST SHE WOULD.--{CONCLUDED] 
She hung her head, and smiled, and giggled, 
Her giggle to me was bliss; 
And when we parted on that night, 
I 
tried to steal a 
kiss.— Cho. 
I 
often met her after that, 
And I'd take her here and there, 
And every ti:ne I 
got a 
chance 
My passiou I'd declare. 
I've vow'd to be true on the top of Saint Nur; 
On the Undergrcund rail, Richmond Hill. 
At last I 
said, " if she wouldn't wed, 
By jingo! mysolf I'd kill."—Clho. 
I 
thought it was " rifht," and so I 
had 
Tha banns put up " on spec," 
And sent my love a " sweet silk dress," 
Her darling self to dech. 
Upon the wedding morn I 
called, 
My intended bride to find, 
Not dressed at all, and worst of all, 
She'd not made up her mind. 
Spoken----She said she thought— 
Cho.—At first she would, and then she wouldn't. 
And then, somehow, she thought she couldn't, 
And then she said, " I 
really shouldn't,' 
And I 
was a 
naughty, naughty man. 
Well, after that, we married were, 
And we're pretty jolly at home; 
To one thing, though, my wife objects, 
That's when I 
wish to roam. 
She says that " home's the proper place 
For all good married men," 
If I 
trot out at night I 
have 
To be in bed by ten. 
6poken—As for letting me have the latch-key—. 
Cho.— Once she would, but now she wouldn't; 
I 
say " she could," she says " she couldn't," 
She says, " what's more, she's sure she shouldn't," 
And I'm a 
naughty, naughty man.

MY

I'm an American cit-i-zan; 
I'm proud you know, 
Wherever I 
go, 
I'm a 
true born Irishman: 
There's one thing, me boys, I'd have you know, 
And I've come to tell ye that, 
It's the seventeenth of March, 
Whin, as stiff as starch, 
I

CHORUS . 
For it's down Broadway I 
march so gay, 
Wkl Cornelius, Barney and Pat— 
The people shout whin I 
turn out, 
And parade with my old hat. 
That hat was made in Dublin, 
In the year of ninety-eight; 
'Twas never called in and ye can't begin 
To say it's out of date. 
It's travelled the wide world over, 
From Ireland to Bombay, 
And the only time it can be seen 
Is on St. Patrick's day.

For it's down, etc. 
Thin give three cheers for the hat I

Before it is too late, 
And nine more cheers for Patrick's day,

I'll raise me hat to ye, 
I'll invite ye all to come and call, 
And join my company.

SOMEBODY WANTS THE DOCTOR. 
Written, Composed, and Sung with great success by HARRY EVE. 
PERHAPS you don't know who I 
am, my name is Alfred Proctor, 
And by profession you must know I'm noted as a 
doctor. 
At college I 
was called M.D., which means by rule of Cocker, 
That I 
can settle everything—except my bell and knocker. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
can cure head-ache, heart-ache, tooth-ache, 
knee-ache, toe-ache, stomach-ache, in fact I 
can cure anything 
on the face of the earth except my street door knocker and 
night- bell, and they are continually going into convulsions, some-
thing after this style : 
CHORUS. 
Rat- a- tat, rat-a-tat-tat, oh goodness, gracious me, what's that 7 
Ding- a-ding-ding, ring-a-ding- ding, there's somebody wants the 
doctor. 
Quite tired out I 
go to bed, to get some sleep then try to, 
When just as I 
am dozing off my door I 
have to hie to ; 
.) " 
Oh, doctor, I 
am very sorry you to have to waken, 
But Mrs. Johnson's baby boy i 
very badly taken." 
SPOKEN.—M rs. Johnson's baby boy, poor little fellow; now 
you go home and give him—well, let me see, give him a 
quart 
of jalap, three pints of ice cream and about a 
half a 
gallon of 
castor oil, give him that hot three times a 
day ; if that doesn't 
cure him, well, it'll pretty soon kill him. 
Well, off she goes, 
and as soon as she's left it starts again. 
Rat-a- tat- tat, etc. 
No rest I 
get from morn to eve, it's really very shocking, 
My street door too is wearing out by this infernal knocking. 
But what annoys me more than all, as sure as I'm a 
sinner, 
Is that confounded loud rat-tat on Sunday after dinner. 
SPOKEN.— On Sunday, after dinner, boys, when me and the 
old woman are quietly sitting down enjoying our port wine and 
peaches—when we can get them—we're suddenly annoyed, 
troubled and bothered, by that confounded loud—

ED BURTON'S NEW MEDLEY. 
As arranged and sung by ED 
BURTON and HARRY Eviz 
I'vE been thinking of late, I've been thinking, 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define; 
I've been thinking how people could wonder 
At our nation's great increase of crime; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
Such sights you will scarcely behold; 
To the fever dens go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoardings of gold in— 
Fourteenth street, there you meet 
Lots of swells and girls so sweet; 
Fourteenth street, what a 
treat, 
Doing the grand in— 
Baden Baden Spa, France of Germany, 
Liverpool or London, Spain or Italy, 
In such society there's much variety, 
But nothing equals— 
Dancing round the May- pole on the first of May, 
Dancing round the May- pole, who would not be gay 
Dancing round the May-pole on the first of May, 
Dancing round— 
Eily Mavourneen, I 
see thee before me, 
Fairer than ever in death's pallid Ii tie ; 
Mortal thou art not—I 
humbly adore thee, 
Yes, with a 
love that is— 
Whiskey, you're the divil, you're leading me astray, 
Over hills and mountains and to Arnerikay ; 
You're stronger, sweeter, dacenter, you're spunkier nor 
tay; 
Oh— 
Touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
And sing me the songs that I 
love, 
'Twill recall the bright days when we played in the wood 
And watched the birds flitting above ; 
There was one that you sang, my pretty Louise, 
The words I 
remember them vell ; 
I 
loved it, and when you had finished each verse, 
I 
kissed you, and said never tell. 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, Just— 
After the Opera's over, after the Opera's done, 
We gems of the very first water with— 
Little Mary Ann, sweet little Mary Ann— 
The village song from morn till night is—

ED BURTON'S NEW MEDLEY.—Continued. 
Don't I 
like my beer, oh, don't I 
like my beer, 
Old or mild will suit this child so long as— 
I 
never drink hard, for it don't suit me, 
To toast my friends with a 
one, two, three; 
Merry and wise is the motto for me, 
And be up with— 
Old Brown's daughter, Nvho's a 
proper sort of girl, 
Old Brown's daughter, she's as fair as any pearl ; 
I'd like to be an alderman, a 
marquis, or an earl, 
I'll be blowed if I 
wouldn't mary old Brown's girl— 
For I (bat on the ground she walks upon, 
And her two bright eyes that shine ; 
I 
would not take all the money in the bank 
For the girl that I 
call— 
Jarnsetjhee, ma jabajehoy, 
Jabbery dobie porie, 
Ikey pikey sikey crikey, 
ChillingoNvullbadorie. 
Far back in my musings my thoughts have been cast, 
To the cot where the hours of my childhood were passed ; 
I 
loved all its rooms, its pantry and hall, 
But that blessed old kitchen was dearer than all ; 
Its chairs and its tables none brighter could be, 
For all its surroundings were sacred to me, 
From the nail in the ceiling to the latch on the door, 
And I 
loved to be— 
Down at the Branch, down at the Branch, 
Down at the Branch, down at the Branch, 
Doing the la de da— 
Spooning on the sands, spooning on the sands, 
With Kitty, or Polly, or dear little Day, spooning on the 
sands ; 
Spooning on the sands, spooning on the sands, 
Oh, isn't it jolly, so awfully jolly to be— 
Waiting for Nelly at Union Square, 
Waiting for Nelly at Union Square, 
Every night when the stars shine bright, 
I'm waiting for Nelly at Union Square; Then— 
Give me the spade and the man that can use it, 
A 
fig for your lords with their soft, silken hands 
Let he who has strength never stoop to abuse it ; 
Give back to the giver the land, boys, the land.

A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.---[CoNcLunEn.] 
The gay and giddy crowd, 
Which every day we view, 
Both old and young have passions strong 
As those our grandsires knew ; 
In friendship and in truth, 
You'll find 'twas ever so, 
For fools believed, and knaves deceived, 
A

A hundred years ago,

For fools believed, and knaves deceived,

YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND TO ME. 
Sung by E . 
BURTON, the popular baritone. 
MY bark of life was tossing down the troubled stream of time, 
When first I 
saw your smiling face, when youth was in its 
prime ; 
My days of darkness turned to light, my sorrowed heart was 
free, 
Oh, since that time I've always found you've been a 
friend to 
CHORUS . 
I'll ne'er forget where'er I 
roam, 
Whatever I 
may be 
If ever I 
have had a 
friend, 
You've been a 
friend to me. 
Misfortune nursed me as her child, and fondly loved me too, 
I 
would have hail a 
broken heart, had it not been for you ; 
Kind words were whispered soft and sweet, but glad I 
could not 
be, 
Until I 
found that you had been a 
faithful friend to me. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc. 
The light of hope from your bright eyes dispelled the clouds 
of strife, 
And threw their rays of sunshine down my weary path of life ; 
I 
now look back upon the past, along life's stormy sea, 
I 
smile to think ' mid all life's scenes, you've been a 
friend to me. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc. 
BANJO DUET. 
On, here we are a 
very funny pair, 
And of us you had better all beware, 
We can play the banjo and dance and shout, 
And you can bet your bottom dollar, 
That our mothers know we're out, 
What a 
very funny pair are we. 
Oh, what a 
funny little chap is he, 
He is too smart for me, 
He went into a 
blacksmith shop 
To get out of the rain, 
lie picked up a 
red-hot horse shoe, 
And he laid it down again, 
What a 
smart young chap was he. 
Oh, you need not laugh quite so loud, 
Of your smartness you need not be so proud, 
She bought a 
lot of hens, 
And in hot water put their legs, 
To see if she wouldn't make them 
Lay boiled eggs— what a 
smart little girl was she. 
Now you've got yourself into a 
stew. 
I'll tell all the people about you ; 
She got married the other day, 
And her husband got tight, 
And he sat up courting her all night, 
What a 
funny old man was he. 
I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU, 
BOY. 
Sung with great success by E. BURTON. 
TH 
ERE is a 
kindly greeting, we always love to hear, 
'Tis when our old friends wish us, " Merry Christmas " once a 
year ; 
But there is another greeting, I 
hear perhaps every day, 
'Tis when some old friend takes my hand, and proudly seems to 
say : 
CHORUS. 
I'm glad to see you, boy ; Fm glad to see you, boy. 
I 
feel so gay, when people say, l'm glad to r.,ee you, boy. 
Perhaps too we are courting, and some blue-eyed maiden fair 
Has won our heart, how gladly then to see her we repair ; 
The door is quickly opened, and there stands our little dear, 
Who greets us with a 
winning smile, and whispers in our ear : 
I'm glad to see you, boy, etc. 
The broker and the tax- collector seldom bring us ,joy, 
We do not often greet them with, I'm glad to see you, boy ; 
But as they one and all are here, surrounding me to- day, 
Believe inn, that I 
fe:.1 quic proud whenever I 
hear you 
I'm Owl to Lco you, boy, etc.

Am.—" Ten Thousand Miles Away." 
I 
strProsE yes all heard this tune, 
It's ten thousand miles away, 
But's not the one I'm going to sing 
For that has had its day. 
But I'm going to tell of an Irish girl, 
W ho loves me, so they say, ay, ay; 
She's plump and fat as butter, boys, 
And she lives across the way. 
CHORUS. 
My Peg she has blue eyes, 
Her trade is making pies, 
Her cheeks is red, 
And so is her head, 
And she hails from Dublin Bay, ay, ay, 
She is as thick as she is tall, 
And she wears a 
waterfall, 
She's gone on me, that's plain to see, 
My girl across the way. 
Her father is a 
Connaught man, 
Her mother is a 
Tip, 
And she was born in Kerry, 
So yes see she's not a 
Mick ; 
I've told yes all I 
can, me boys, 
For I 
must not delay, ha, ha, 
For this very night I'm to be spliced 
To this girl across the way. 
My Peg etc. 
MY LITTLE ONE'S WATCHING FOR ME. 
IN 
the dell where the brooklet's gently flowing, 
On the bench ' neath the old willow tree, 
Where the birds their songs are gently singing, 
My little one's waiting for me, 
And she knows well the sound of my footstep 
As I 
cross o'er the bridge by the lea, 
And I 
hasten with arms stretched to greet her, 
My little one's waiting for me. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
And at night when my daily toil is over, 
And I'm wending my way towards my home, 
My heart always beating with pleasure, 
For my little one's waiting for me. 
As I 
cross o'er the clear rippling brooklet, 
Their watching I 
always can see, 
On the bench ' neath the old weepin7 willow 
My little one's waiting for mo.

OFF LIKE A ROCKET. 
AN 
unfortunate fellow am I—one who never successful can be, 
Good luck always passes me by, disappointment alone visits me , 
For whatever I 
do, be as cheerful or bright as I 
may, 
There's a 
time that soon comes, when all my good plans fly 
away. 
CHORUS. 
Off like a 
rocket as it flies away, 
Amid the clouds on high, sir; 
Up in the air with a 
flash so gay, 
It flies up in the sky, sir. 
Now in Wall street I 
thought I'd invest, and of course become 
a 
wealthy at once, 
So the whole of my cash I 
laid out, oh ! alas, I 
was such a 
dunce, 
For you see one fine day a 
beautiful crash came around ; 
And the whole of my fine cash went floating away, as I 
found. 
It went off like a 
rocket, etc. 
A 
charming young creature I 
loved, and I 
fondly hoped that she 
loved me, 
But when the sweet question I 
popped, I 
found that we did not 
agree, 
For she said when I 
asked her if my dear better half she would 
be, 
That she wished, and must have, a 
much handsomer fellow than 
me. 
I 
went off like a 
rocket, etc.

THE SUNBEAM. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
0, DON'T you wish that you were me 
It is no use saying no, 
For the girls they say I 
am quite the thing, 
I 
guess they ought to know; 
They say I 
have such a 
graceful style, 
My laugh the air keeps ringing, 
And then my dance is all 0. K., 
You can't discount my singing. 
CHORUS. 
So it is let the times be what they may, 
You will find this darkey always gay, 
For you I 
will sing and dance all night, 
To please you all is my delight. 
Now what's the use to hang your head, 
And pine and grieve with sorrow ; 
Come take a 
lesson now by me, 
And grief you will never borrow ; 
If you only saw my Nell and I, 
You would never sigh again; 
I 
am only waiting for the day 
That she might change her name. 
So it is let, etc. 
When the moon is shining bright and clear, 
I 
to and see my Nell, 
And by the burning amber light, 
Our tale of love we tell; 
She says i 
am all the world to her, 
And to me she is just the same; 
I 
am only waiting for the day 
When she may change her name. 
So it is let, etc.

MICHAEL DWYER . 
A BALLAD. 
AT 
last, brave Michael Dwyer, you and your trusty men 
Are hunted through the valley and tracked into the glen, 
Sleep not, but watch and listen, keep ready blade and ball, 
The soldiers know you're hiding this night at Akild le Morn ; 
The soldiers seached the valley, and towards the dawn of day 
Discovered where the outlaw, the dauntless rebel lay; 
Around the little cottage they formed into a 
ring, 
And called out, " Michael Dwyer, surrender to the King." 
Up spoke Michael Dwyer—" Unto this house we came, 
Unasked by those who own it, they cannot be to blame; 
Then let these quiet people unquestioned pass you through, 
And when they are placed in safety, I'll tell you what we'll do." 
'Twas done; and now said Dwyer, " Your work you may begin, 
You are a 
hundred outside, we are only four within ; 
We've heard your haughty summons, and this is our reply, 
We are true united Irishmen, we will fight until we die." 
Then burst the red Mar's lightning, in poured the leaden rain, 
The hills around re-echoed, the thunder pealed again ; 
• 
The soldiers fall around us, brave Dwyer sees with pride, 
But ab! one 2allant comrade lies wounded by our side, 
But there are three remaining, good battle still to do, 
Their hands are strong and steady, their aim is quick and true ; 
But hark ! what horrid shouting the savage soldiers raise— 
The house is fired around us, the roof is in a 
blaze. 
Then higher and still higher the lurid flame arose, 
And louder swelled the laughter and cheering of the foes; 
Up spoke the brave McAllister, that weak and wounded man, 
" 
You shall escape, my comrades, and this shall be your plan : 
Place in my hand a 
musket, and lay upon the floor; 
I'll stand before the soldiers—throw open wide the door, 
They will pour into my bosom the fire of their array, 
And while their guns are empty, dash through them and away." 
He stood before the soldiers, revealed amidst the flames— 
Out of their levelled pieces the wished- for volley came; 
Up sprang the three survivors for whom our hero d:ed, 
But only Michael Dwyer burst through the ranks outside ; 
lie baffled his pursuers, who followed like the wind, 
lie swam the River Slaney, and left them far behind, 
And many were the soldiers he promised soon should fall, 
For those, his gallant comrades, who died at Akild le Mom.

AIN'T YOU AWFUL. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. H. Efeanixo, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E H. H ARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Written and composed by JosErn P. SUELLY. 
I 
TOOK my love one ev'ning, 
When the summer moon was beaming, 
Thro' silent arbors gleaming, 
Where Cupid has control; 
I 
wanted to tell her 
how dearly I 
adored her, 
But oh, she would not listen, 
Tho' I 
tenderly implored her ; 
Oh, love, oh, love, why don't you heed me 7 
How can you treat me so 7 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not my pain; 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, ain't you awful; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Yes, you are awful; 
Your like I 
ne'er did see ; 
Oh, ain't you awful ; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Dear me, you're horrid ; 
Why don't you let me be 7 
To make my feelings clearer, 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said I'd like to hear her 
Say yes, and ease my mind ; 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention ; 
She said mamma would scold her, 
If such things she dared to mention ; 
" 
Come, love," I 
cried, " we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind." 
" 
Oh, no, oh, no," she said. 
" 
Don't ask me now to wed; 
What would the people say 
If we should run away 7 " 
Oh, ain't you awful, etc. 
(1) 
AIN'T YOU AWFUL.--continued. 
She talked on useless matters, 
Till my patience was in tatters, 
Just as a 
woman clatters, 
When silent she should be ; 
I 
begged her to listen, 
And drew her close beside me ; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes defied me, 
And soon she told me with a 
smile 
That she did not care for me; 
My love was all in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
Oh, ain't you awful, etc. 
A HANDFUL OF TURF. 
As sung by ED 
BURTON. 
IT'S sailing I 
am at the dawn of the day 
To my brother that's over the sea, 
And it's little I 
care for my life anywhere, 
For ' tis breaking my poor heart will be ; 
But a 
treasure I 
take for old Ireland's sake, 
And I'll pledge all belonging above, 
'Tis a 
handful of turf from the land of me birth, 
From the heart of the country I 
love. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Then won't that poor lad in his exile be glad, 
When he sees the bright present I 
bring ?. 
And won't then the flowers in their elegant bowers 
Breathe forth the perfume of spring 7 
Oh, Erin, Machree though it's parted we'll be, 
'Tis a 
blessing I 
leave on your shore, 
Though your mountains and streams I 
will see in my 
dreams, 
Till I 
cross to old Ireland once more. 
(Repeat as before.

can't do less than give her a
