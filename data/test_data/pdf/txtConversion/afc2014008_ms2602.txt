 makes me want to run away and  H &
 iv
 
-mbarrassment,  an embarrassment compounded of warm,  juven
 
feelings
 of affection and
 inadequacy.  Until  recently  i
t
 
has  been difficult for me to do anything at all,  yet  I ha'
 
striven mightily
 
Now almost every morning  big
 visions come  .
 Many ci
l
 
t hem  I am able to put scribble
 down or  rattle off on the
 
word  processor,  as  I crawl  aching and often  rather  hearts (
 
11
 
out of  bed  .
 These many pages of notes are the best work
 
I
've ever done.Stored away this accumulation will  be useful
 
for the systematic
 writing  that  I must soon do.
 At times
 
when  I feel  most discouraged with myself,  I think that
 
oven  I  don't do anything with them,  some student,  picking
 
over my lieterary bones
 will  find a lot of them curious and
 
some even exciting.
 
But they never
 would  have happened  if  I hadn'L
 
able to hang on  here during these  last years.  I have
 
urgently needed
 the continuity of this  place,  with  I
ts
 
hosts of  familier things,  to keep on working out solutio n;
 
for  the problems that  have so long  preoccupied me.  The
 
support  that youall
 have given me
 has enabled to chip
 
away at them without sinking  into total  anxiety
 during
 
these  last  rather dreadful  years.  But talk and notes and
 
splavication don't countr--it's  product that  our society
 
wants--loved onesw want  product just as much as  friendly
 
strangers do.  And  I haven't  been  produc: inp,  I

films at  the Musee de l'Homme in  Paris  in the winter. There
 
after one of my showings
 I met a young female producer-- -
very talented
 -who found my dance films wonderful  and Just
 
what  she needed as the material  for a series of  5 minute
 
ethnographic films she was developing for  French TV.  Her, 
notion was that short shorts of ethnographic content would
 
make the perfect filler for other  kinds of serious cultur
 
broadcasting on the French educational  network.  She was a
 
superb editor and  I stayed on and worked with her for a bit:
 
for  pay  .

3)  The there was the Marseill]os
 
celebration of the works of  Lomax 
 in June I spent a mon H
 
getting  ready.
 I pulled out  20 of our old  teaching film:
 
cleaned
 them up,  and now
 it would  be possible,  with a
 
little more work to have a good course on Choreometrics a
:
 
result  .
 Also developed new ideas about  human synchrony,
 
incorporated these  in a new teaching film.
 
All  in all
 I cleaned up and  refurbished the wholo
 
Choreometrics thing a lot  ,
 putting  it  in shape  tc
 be
 
taught,  and next year  FP and  I will  stgart  teaching  it  at
 
Hiunter
 
Then  I went
 to
 Marseilles
 and talked for 4 days
 
rather steadily ---the director of  the center said  it was tha
 
longest scholarly s2eech
 he had ever  heard-. I fell  far
 
short of winning my audience,  but  I know the substance was
 
good  ,
 even  revolutionary  ,putting together
 
a viable rationale for ethnographic film--which is what  th ey
-
had asked me to do.  The whole thing was taped;  it was
 
supposed to be transcribed  for  publication--but the outfit
 
has  run out  funds--and now  I am tryinmg to get  them to scu d
 
me the tapes,  so  I can somehow tackle the job myself..  I

was truly a huge piece of work--and  I believe a good on
 
but now of course,  I
'm kind of mad about  it--and feel  I
 
shouldn't  pursue it myself.  However  I find that  1 lac k a

Patchwork programs  .
 Well  these Brits
 sailed  into my

 to get  the sample of Soviet movement  and dance that
 
i had not  been able to collect  in earlier visits--this we
 
did  by
 shooting the whole festival
 off the screen as thc
 
pictures from all  over USSR were shown,
 using a little hand
 
held camera  ,
 getting about  12  hours of  patterns from all
 
parts of the Socviet union.
 
b)  Showing the Choreometric films,  especial],
 
Longest Trail.  They were big  hits,  won  priozes  in the
 
festival  competition,  were given special  showings at
 
local  theatre,  at the university and used as  part of a
 
telecast  the night that  Reagan and Gorbachev
 signed thni;'
 
agreement.  I discovered on the Finnish visit that
 
CCantometrics and Choreometrics
 were regarded  in
 
Scandanavia.
 
5)  The  Intelligent Museum of Human Behaviti'
 
Great  progress  has  been made this year on saving the
 
project's data  banks  *
 and  bringing them back  into
 
As you may remember,  Norman  had to work with old-fashicio
 
proghramming tools and on the huge and  hard to handle
 
Mainframe computer at Columbia.  Howvere,  he did  produce
 
extraordinary results--matching geographic taxonomico "H
 
song,  dance,  speech,  orchestras and culture--
intercorrelations  between  hundreds of variables  in all  the
 
f
ields.
 
Now  it  is  possible to use a computer to call  up
 
patterns of  song and dance performances  illustrative of all
 
these relationships.  Compact discs can now store
 30 to 80
 
hours of sound on a sde and computers could call  up example;;
 
of all  the things we have found from the recordings that we
 
have already analyzed from all  over the world.  The
 
combination would give rise
 to
 make an  intelligent world
 
museum
 of music and dance and ccl Lure.

 I thought you might like best to hear some of the

is rhe Alabama one, the Texas one and the Virginia one, that you won't
 
know, maybe, butwill like---and then one of Brazilian music that
 
I

but  if  it's a question of your basic health,  I think you owe it to yours
 
elf and all of us who love you and need you to plan to do that.  There
 
are  lots of good people,  whom you can afford,  who could make your
 
domestic  life rosy and
 -make Tom feel so good he wouldn't
 
mind occasional
 spells of rest for you.  Please take
 
a loving brother's B9 solemn council and solve this problem.  If you
 
do,  many others will be  resolved.
 
Znd please don' t get mad at me for trying to advise you.  I
 
love you very very much.  If we occasionally differ,  that s no more than
 
two people always  do. You have the right to fuss at me,  since you
 
are my older sister who partly raised me.  I have a right sometimes
 
to disagree,  J
@H maybe even crossly,  because I am ,
 after all  68 and
 
occasionally  in a bad temper because I am overburdened and not smart enoc
 
ough to carry out all the  jobs I've promised.

at1ey wrote me recently that you had sustained a severe
 
ry. I hope that whole thing has cleared up by now. But let
 
aow how you're coming along, because I
've worried about you.
 
1
;
 '
s not nice to think of you ±z
 zx
s z X being held down by
 
like that.
 
have spent this year paying myself out of debt for my m.r ci1-
1
.
:
 extremely expensive, voyage to Italy. The trip netted ic
 
hours of recordings and ended with a complete survey of Itai1.
 
olk music, the first im ever done, but it set me back physical
 
ncia11y a whole lot.
 
Iings are finally beginning to go very well, however. I  i
 
a very handsome contract with Doubleday for another balla('
 
The Polk Music of North America, which is to be pub1is.
 
xt Christmas. And my Penguin book of American folk songs is alr
 
one and on the way. My last 550 series was so successful that the:
 
e willing to send me just about where Iwant to Co. and my next
 
rip will ,
 I think be to West Africa, for the winter and sprili,
 
)
57-58, to record the material that lies back of the blues, tb
:
 
iritua1s and jazz.
 
I think all of us have been worr
mi .n  Ennoyed about wha
 
uen happening to the Lomax songs---th(
,, 
by music publisher_.
 
have been working on this problem fop: a
iDou  six months, Progress
 
as slow at first, But at last results are begif
lning to show, Her ':
 
story,and, as I need your help and support on this one, i' L
'
 
the way it happened to me.
 
:
.
) Several young English ballad singers began last spring
 
congs they learned off Lead Belly records, The records mac
 
i
 i
cI
,  Backed by this money, they then were promoted into hit-
_n the states. And the capital accumulated enabled the Howard 1ic -
ond Publishing Group to maintain the copyri hts against the litt:
'
 
Iarks,,,, Aftre the third of fourth song, I began to get mad, be
 
;use these bozos were claiming to have written t
 he songs, words
 
J
.S
 when, in fact t
 hey were simply copying them out of a
xb z x
 
o
r
iiax books or from secondary recorded sources,
 
2) I put a firm of lawyers on the scent. After silence for
 
S, Richmond has written me a letter asking me  t
o participate
 
i
i  tie exploitation of a Bahaman song I collected in 1936 and whi
 
ppears in Our Singing country--our title--Married Man--new title
 
cy Liley-Liley. This song I had altered somewhat and taught to I
'Sc
 
ueger, and from him it spread back over here. It was about to be
 
ubliehed ,
 words and music, by someone named Whytton, when they
 
ame to me.
 
3) The Pnglish branch of Richmond, 5ssex
 really rurA this
 
f n c
1 - me in, They
 
e
:
 
vey l
iad a
ii
'eady stoleri---they have published
., they showed me,
 
about ten songs frmm our books. I don't know what they have
 
copyrighted
, but not yet published
. and I have asked them to find
.
 
out,
 
Naturally I would like s
omething of what they have already
 
made, and
, they may eventually pal something. But everyone seems
 
to think that it is doubtful, and my lawyers here do not be
 
lieve I could collect if I sued
. them.  I
'll keep working on
 
that,
 
Meantime my agent and other advisors here have S
ugge sted
 
that I ask Richmond to form a c
ompany which would
, exploit the
 
rest of the Loamx collections,
 
this month 0 
published
, and
. unpublished
,
. Ri ch-
mond seems quite willing to discuss that when he comes
 here  
Meantime, again, the Essex f
irm, which had be en robbing me
 
up to this point ,  are now being very very nice. They call me
 
whenever they hear of a new record
, comin out or when a group
 
of local skiff
-L8 singers some in with a new number and aks me
 
whether it belongs to the Lomaxes. If it does, then they
 
draw up a contract in our name. Even if it doesn't pertain to
 
one of their singing groups or recording sessions, they are
 
policing it and
, claiming copyright for us.
 
Like
 other raekets, this one is carefuilt organized.
 
Essex is tied up with the recording director who actually makes
 
most of the sessions and(or) manages the skiffle groups
,1who do
 
make them. I have now become freid
.nly with both Essexand the re-
ord
.ing director, 2x And
, they are watching all the ratho es for
 
me in a mammer I c
ould never do if I didn't devote my whole
 
time t
o it.
 
They now propose, not only to w fight for all our copy-
rights, as at the present, but to build up,out of our books
 
and
, from fresh material I offer them, a c
ataalogue of numbers
 
which they will offer the groups as they c
ome in. Material that
 
has already been reworked
, s
o that our copyright has be'
 
assured * This is a pro-
u
.tempore relationship until the day
 
our comoany is f
ormed,
 
This company will then be an app
dage of the Richmond
,
 
organization, run by Essex here, They will take 10  of s
ongs
 
they publish, and 50 %
(this is unfortunately the normal) of
 
songs they put their plugging organization tz behind. But if
 
we have a company, we will not only profit as writers, but
 
as publishers as well.
 
There are a lot of peculiar angles to this business. In
 
the first place, it is strange that, for the moment, the s
ongs
 
are being launched by English groups, amateurs mostly who have
 
fallen for Leadbelly's things. It is lucky f
or us that so far
 
they don't have anything much available to them but things we
 
have published
., How long this state of affairs will last, I
 
don't know. Maybe day after tommorrow an American group will
 
3
)
 
come along. Then somebody will have to be in New York to
 
look over the ratholes there.
 
Another thing is that all lawyers assure me that our
 
copyright, if any, has been in many oases "abond
.oned
." because
 
we didn't protest when the songs were first used
.. So that
 
if I told
. Richmond to go to hell and to pay me the several
 
thousand dollars he owes right now, he could probably start
 
a suit that we would
. lose. The"efore I seem forced to go
 
into b3 u business with him.  $
 
Again, of course, our rights in all these songs, because
 
we didn't publish them first in an arranged f
orm, are question-
able. In the American courts. I could never even get my English
 
lawyers to discuss a suit when Lonnie Donnegan took Bring Me
 
a Little Water, Sylvie, right out of the material Lead
. Belly
 
sold
. us.
 
About the Lead
.belly songs. As you know, he sued pa, when
 
the book was in process. Then in settlement of 300 dollars,
 
he signed over all his rights on the songs to us. ?k*zbwsk
 
Martha, who doesn't know this, is handing over all Leadbell
 
copyrights to another one of the Richmond
. subsidaries. I wrote
 
Richmond about this. I told him that we have this letter from
 
Lead
.belly, that the copyright belongs to us, that the new
 
edition of the Lead
.belly book is in the hands of Duell Sloane
 
and
. Pearce. In making that contract with DSand P some years ago
 
I signed over one third the royalties to Martha Led
.better,
 
keeping one third for me, one third for the Lomax estate.
 
Within a week I heard from Richmond's New "o I
, office that he
 
ha iaapproaohed DSandP and is arranging a co-publication and
 
wqnts copyright assignments.
 
You can see he is a very, very busy boy. All that is to the
 
good
.. He is tf
le big gun in promoting this field both in 1ngland
 
and
. America* ne is certainly a rascal, but then all musi
 u - 
u shers are. And
. I can't get asiy of my most oonservativ  t
o
 
me not to go into business with him. Frankly ,  I don't k
ifbw
 
k wMether to or not.
 
Now to come down to oases, when I meet with him or anybody
 
I ye got to tell them that the Lomax estate is back of me,
 
Suppose we form a company, located
. in England
. or New York, with
 
my agent as operating director, because I can't be bothered
 
with running a monstrous business like that, what should be
 
the estate's share?  My own thought was that the estate get
 
a percentage, say 25% of everything that happens, including
 
songs that John A. had a hand a in and those he didn't.
 
Another suggestion is that you get half after operating expenses
 
including salary for me, I reokon 1is deducted
..
 
At any rate this can be a very profitable Lomax enterprize
 
and it  is not my intention to go in for it alone.
 
By the way I
tting the precedent of cutting in the source
 
of the song--the singer, that is--for a one third s
re of the
 
writers' royalties in almost every case. That is true of the
 
Bahaman woman from whom I collected
. the Married
. Man song. It
 
will be true of E.C. Ball and
. the Jennie Jenkins number that
 
3)m
 
is coming soon, of Rising Sun(I collected this one in Ky)
 
and
. the Ky girl who is the s
ource, the Grey Goose and Lead
.
 buk
 
Belly, Green Corn and Le&d
. Belly. These are the current songs.
 
This g is purely a protempore arrangement to keep us morally
 
and legally in the elear until we work out some better solution.
 
Now I come to a new and bigger idea that this whole
 
thing has raised in my mind. None of these people have any idea
 
of what or where the resources for this folk material are.
 
I have. I am friends with all the people who have the big
 
collections. I am thinking, why not really do this thing
 
right and set up a big international folksong trust, including
 
the Lomaxes, the English Yolk Song Society, the Nat = Scottish
 
and
. Irish sources and hadle all the copyrights in a bloc.
 
Part of the money derived will go back to sources. Part of the
 
money will be used by the organizations concerned to ino ease
 
their collections. Part of the money for folksong research.
 
Then no one could be accused of making a profit out of what is
 
essentially a public domain affair.
 
For me this is what Ip
t prefer. I want to go on with my
 
research. But it is always 80 hard to find
, the money andto
 
but4 the equipment ka needed. I want no part of the business
 
operations here. I should be concerned with finding songs,
 
shaping them popularizing them, etc--the creative end. And
 
I am also good at high-level negociation. But this whole thing
 
is alraadr wasting my time in ! conferences with the dirty
 
little nincompoops in the music business.
 
Would
. you like to take a hand in setting up a big scheme
 
like this, on the business side? It might work very well for
 
everybody concerned. Maybe, of course, someone has already
 
robbed the till too extensively in New York. That would have
 
to be determined. But , here is an angle that surprises me.
 
Even on the songs of ours that Richmond has already pub-
lished credited to one of the little hangers-on in New York,
 
they will discuss publishing a new verEion in our name when
 
a new record is launched and simply leaving their other writer
 
out.  In that way we might, eventually reestablish claims
 
on a lot of the cowboy songs that father "abandoned." What
 
a horrid word for what a noble attitude on his part.
 
I have stayed out of all this up to now, because I didn't
 
want to get involved in such a dirty bt
.siness, but when I see
 
the people that are putting do*  their names as writers on
 
songs father and
. I did find
, and
, put into shape for public con-
suaiption, I just had to do something.
 
So please  think all this over, organize the Lomax tribe
 
behind me, and write me a supporting letter, so that I can
 
handle these local negooiatiof
ls, at least, as they come up.
 
I suspect I shall come home thi s year  to look into this and a
 
lot of other things. For instance, all the Lomaxx stuff in
 
t
.
 
4)
 
the Library should be copied
., arranged and published before
 
the sharks get wk holã of that, too.  Naturally we would
 
be in a better position with Richmond or anyone also if our
 
catalogue of songs was all ready to go, instead of being
 
somewhere on tape.
 
For my part of the bargain I have now most of Spain
 
Italy and
. the British Isles on recora and next winter I am
 
going to West Africa for six or eight months. With the several
 
thousands songs at the disposal of the English folk songs
 
society ,  the scottish groups, etc., we would already present
 
a formidable front.
 
Anyhow, the letter is long enough. Will you boil it
 
down, get replies from the other family members as necessary
 
and write me soon?
 Hope all this doesn't fizzle after two
 
or three songs. It may do, of course. N But ,  from now on to
 
the forseeable future, money,-your money, my time,u.Invested
d
,
 
in all this will pay off for a long time.
 
Anne is here with me, flourishing. Elizabeth i
s nearby
 
writing a book, which, if you followed the Spanish news lately,
 
helped to get Artacoo ,  the Spanish foreign minister sacked
..
 
I am too busy for my own good
., but hope to get a little vacation
 
this spring.
 
Send me news from you and yours. Love

opyright. However, there are quite a lot of unique son ­
ithin the entire corpus--if you take in all the old Lo a:
 
i
ls,, the 25,000 at the LC, and my own very barge  uropean
 
ollections. Interestingly enough, it i
s just such unique
 
songs that pete Kemeron has so far been pirating---House
 
of the Rising Sun, which comes from one source, The grey

,
 
for another.
 
:
) The Howie Richmond technique is to set up a hit recort  ith
 
fellafonte or someone of the sort. He sells a million o'
 
these before anyone has a chance to do research. He also
 
Bells the same version in sheet music , several hundred
 
thousand copies. He bragged to r
ue, for instance, that he
 
had sold 450,000 copies of On Top of Old Smokey , as the
 
result of the \
ieavers record and forced BURL IVES to sii
 
the we
ers version when he rerecorded for Coli
bia. All
 
this has to do with the power politics of t e amusement
 
business,
 
4) The Lomax books have, by and large, consisted of such
 
unique songs, z a z±n ø often sung into a special shape
 
by father or myself or by Bess. It is very interesting  i  Lots
 
that it is these songs or the Miles songs or the sharp son s
.
 
or the Leadbeily songs or the Hughes songs(I Know Where I':
 
oing, Moves Through the Fair, Lass with a Delicate Air) which
 
the music business and the public have found so far the most
 
useable. This is because they were chosen and arranged by all
 
of us with an eye to the urban audience. The other tunes which
 
repose by the thousands in the regional collections are, sur-
risingly few of them, good for the general popular anthology.
 
I have just been through all the anthologies looking for mater
i
a
l
 
'
or my new book and have found very very few new pieces of
 
sufficient appeal to make them worthwhile printin
;.
 
?here is then the possibility of another year or so of editor-
ial selection and arranging work which could very profitably
 
be expended on the corpus of material which remains, Out of I
t
 
should come three or four hundred, perhaps more, songs which
 
-
lave a unique shape and which could he rrotected by the sor'.

March 10, 1959
 
Dear Johnny, Shirley, Margaret, Bess and extended
 
Lomax Clan,
 
From deep inside the New York rat race, all hail and
 
greetings.  If you want to see my concert, by all means
 
come because you'll have free tickets but I doubt If
 
you'll see very much of me because
 have about
 
sixty very complicated people on my hinds all wanting
 
different things at the same time, and these reople have
 
to g-t on stage and also into LP's in about two days.
 
Frankly, I don't want more responsibilities.  If fam—
 
ily money is going to be invested in a trip to New York,
 
invest it for the week after the concert, when we can
 
all have a ball together and my worries one way or the
 
other will be over.  It dso might just be that I'll
 
have a job by then and can take you out to dinner at
 
least once.  Also, I could put you up by then, which I
 
couldn't do during the concert because the beds are
 
promised to tempermental guitar players from the Ozarks.
 
Now, if you can pick your way through these neurotic
 
problems of mine and see a solution that will please
 
you and at the same time not scare me any more than I
 
am scared already, by all means come.
 
Much love to all,
 
AL/dm
 
P
. S
. My secretary 's idea is that you come in time for
 
the concert and we all soend some time together
 
during the ensuing week.
 
Dear Bees,

o know how you liked my record...
 
Enclosed are letters from Susan and
 
Shirley.  The letters from Susan  o back

Most of the peor1e I knew or who were interested in me were away or about to
 
leave, so that my presence here and now in New York i
s all a bit anticlimactic.
 
Nevertheless, everyone has been terribly friendly, kindly, concerned and even
 
a shade worshipful. The last I find very hard t• take and almost imrosetble to
 
adjust to. W

a fire raged for three hours before the foremen could souse the
 
blaze. My flat, for reasons only the fates know, -

3e man,
 
Thank you for your letter of September 10th and for the
 
i
u-
:11 c nDtat i
ons of your ar ran ge me nt  and the tape demOnstration.
 
Tirst of all, I want to say that your arrangement i
s a charming
 
one ¶ndeed, and I can understand why other folk s
ingers should want
 
to s
ine it.
 
As for the busiress arrangements, I think they should
 
not be too  ifficu1t, if we can establish some basic premise .  The
 
irst of these  remises is that I am the only party with a v
csted
 
nterest in the rccorded collection of Alabama Negro m
usic.  The
 
expedition on which these musical mat''nia1s were gathered was fin-
anced by myself and by academic institutions which rendered me
 
additional assistance.
 I paid for the costs of travel,  o
ii c-
tlng, recording equipment, fees to singers, their transportation
 
from one p1 co to another, etc.  As grateful as '
l am to Mrs. Tartt
 
for her asst tance while I was working in the area around Living-
ston, Alabama, she is not, by the nature of things, a p
erty to an:
 
contractual arrangements.  Any arrangement you may wish to enter
 
;l
l1 have to be between you and me,
 re is no need for the
 
inclusion of
 
a
-ny other names in any rublished versions or arranrr-
n nts.  Such acknowledgements as I have made to Mrs. Tartt and  :
c
 
t
's singers and schools involved have bcen
 
'-
 n *e sir
 
of ncnden
i o nract oe in such matters.
 
As to the "split," therefore,

I received yo   l
etter yesterday, and have given considerable t -
ght
 
to its contents.
 It is not a simple letter to answer, because I
t
 
contains a number of diverse elements, challenges and complaints.
 
To complicate matters, you have tied these things to a reply to
 
"enner-Gren inquiry.  I certainly have no wish to avoid an airing
 
of t-i
e various questions, even though I regard your presentation of
 
some of them as not having been carefully considered.  However, in
 
vtew of your having linked these matters to the Wenner-Gren inquiry,
 
which I feel was a gross impropriety, I have had no choice but to
 
Inform Dr. Fejos that I don't fool your reply could, under present
 
circumstances, be a truly objective one.  I might add that I did
 
not give your name or any other as a reference, having left the
 
roblem of referees entirely to the found tjo
s discretion.
 
It was very difficult to avoid the impression (despite your asser-
tion that you were writing "in the friendliest snirit possible")
 
tkat you have clear-cut resentments and complaints over my having
 
rcorded folklore and folk music in certain territories which,
 
a parently, you like to think of as having been staked off like a
 
uranium claim.  When you suggest that collectors oftontin s have
 
an fov rpossessive sense" in regard to areas in which they have
 
worked, I do not know whom you are referring to.  The serious
 
scholars with whom I have been working do not manifest this reeling.
 
Tf you yourself at tiTe s may be aroused by the feeling that others
 
should not follow where you have broken the ground, perhaps it is
 
te wrong feeling to have.
 If someone follows you to a particular
 
area and produces nothing new or useful, discriminating people will
 
surely comprehend that fact, and your reputation cannot be tarnish-
ed.  If a little something new come s ou t of second, third, and fourth
 
efforts in a particular region, surely it is in the in
terests of
 
knowledge and understanding.  I myself have never been able to co -
prebend the mentality which identifies particular folk singers
 
with certain collectors, as though the latter "own" them in a spec-
ial sense.
 
Now I would like to point out something about the area of my record-
ing activities in 1950.  I spent some two weeks or longer gathering
 
materials in the region of Silacauga, six or seven days in the
 
neighborhood of Puskoegee, two weeks in the environs of Selma and
 
ogue chitta, two weeks, approximately, in Livingston and the
 
territory around it, several days in eastern Mississippi, and then
 
another week in  i1acauga.
 I normally do not feel obligated to
 
account to anyone for the areas in which I choose to make investiga-
tions*
 I simply want to point out to you that Livingston, while a
 
fru itful and pbasant exner 4ence larrrely because of the kindness of
 
ke mnrtt s, w s only -art
 of a broader  '
ro!
.-ram.
 
2
 
Some of tbo other roints you ra1 e had bast "e
 r
erod in an it a
m-
ized way.
 
The matter of yo- r havina riven re Ruby's name seeus to play a
 
large nart in your sense of having been wronged.
 I might say,
 r-
enthetically, that Livingston and the Tartta were mentioned by otL rs
 
as well.  As for my statement to you, which I recall very well, that
 
I was going South to gather n oria1 for a novel, that was in every
 
respect true.  I have in fact written the novel, and I expect it
 
to be published in 1960 or 1961.  There will be more mterials of
 
this kind to follow.  As for recording, it vms a purely secondary
 
interest on that occasion.  With the u
t erest that I have in folk-
lore, as you must know, I rarely make trips of any nature without
 
thinking of the possibility of adding to existing recorded mater-
ials.  Most of the stuff I 1 ve been able to record during the
 
ast twenty years is now in the archives of various American Uni-
versities.
 I have not regarded the fruits of my recording exper-
iences as a private treasure.
 I have not copyrighted it, so that I
 
might thus control its use and make money for myself out of it.  You
 
say in your b tter that my recording work in 1950 "didn 't oorresnond"
 
with what I told you at the t
ime about my plans, and you unavoidably
 
leave t
he  implication that you certainly would not have mentioned
 
Ruby Tartt had you known I might make recordings.
 I can only say
 
that, on the contrary, I have given Ruby 's name to many people w
'o
 
were intending to do some work in the area, with no thought of
 
whether they might see or hear s
ome of the same singe-s known to
 
others who hod passed through Livingston before them.
 
As to "that painful correspondence" with Ruby, as you
 ut it, it
 
appears to be an odd note in a l
etter regarding a recommendation.
 
T belie ve I answered you in teat detail on the subject when you
 
brought it to my attention,  That oorres:ondence was indeed pain-
ful to me, because both Fnma and I were dearly fond of Ruby and
 
ratt.  As you yourself have said, they are extraordinary and won-
derful people.  I have never understood how things between us and
 
the Tartts got out of hand the way they did.  Perhaps if I had been
 
able to get back there and see them everything could have been
 
straightened out.  I am deeply sorry.  But I must repeat for your
 
information that the singers were all well paid for their efforts
 
on the spot, much more handsomely than Ruby would have permitted
 
had she known.  Subsequently they received additional chocks from
 
no in New York,  as well as large amounts of clothing.  Ruby received
 
a fifty dollar check from Folkways for a little introduction she
 
wrote on ohii ren's games (which she said was the first money she
 
bad ever received for work with folk music).
 I tried but faller' to
 
et her a foundation grant for her work, though I did secure fou
 
her, by my personal si,znature, a recording machine.  As you well
 
know, her name has appeared on all of the records containing the
 
Alabama material, and in all of the booklets.
 Th it not reasona
1e
 
for me to ask, under the ciroumstanc s, why  TOU  are so concerned
 
over whether Ruby receives proper credit?
 
Your question about the area from which uy n tarials co' ,­ Ia, I
 
feel, out of order.
 I do not feel that I an  accountable to anyone
 
for regions I wish to  epresent in a study.  Nor do I regard the
 
query as to whether I will do justice to Ruby and various singers
 
an a
rorriate one.  I suppose these quori a are
 ica ad on an
 
3
 
assumption that certain rog ons and peoplo arc "off bounds," and
 
that clearance and approval must be obtaired.
 I have made my
 
feelii s clear already on these things.  It has never been my in-
tent to steal anyone 's thunder.  I am not a pop SOY€
 writer, and I
 
an not concerned with muscling in on anyone for monetary of any
 
other kind of gain.
 I try to do a decent job within the confines
 
of my orn sphere of in erest, and to share the few benefits which
 
accrue.
 
I do not beli vo, as you put it, t
lmt my nosition is "awk;ard."  I
 
do not subscribe to the theory of prior "right" in folk music, and
 
a-u particularly aware that many other folklorists have wended their
 
way through areas originally passed through by your father.  It is
 
about ten years since the field trip in question.  If I now wish to
 
make available some materials which may be useful to society, it
 
surely can not be injurious to anyone except persons who may feel
 
that a "keep off" sign is forever valid.  I believe that you aro of
 
two minds on this question.  I for one do not feel that people and
 
riaces can be copyrighted.  If you were at work currently in any
 
area, I would certainly not move in and do comparable work there at
 
the same time.  But I do not think there is any moral precept which
 
would prevent me from working there at a future date, or that woul d
 
prevent you from undertaking studies in places where I had been.
 
As for Ruby Tartt writing the book on her work and experiences, why
 
not?  Even if she were planning to do so, does that mean that no
 
one else may comment on that scene?  Certainly she should write such
 
a book, and it is a pity that she hasn't already done so.  7
1ut I
 
gather that you yourself have fell; free to use sore of "her" sing-
ers for book material.
 
You did not ask about the nature of the material w
j dch Vonner-Gren
 
has on its mind; certainly the brief statement on the subject, which
 
you must have seen, must have given you at 3
Bast a clue, so I shall
 
not go any further into that aspect of t
he question.
 
r
ith the hope of making my views clear, I have probably written too
 
long a letter.  Nevertheless, the-e may be other points that you
 
would like to discuss, and I am willing to meet with you and ex-
niore tHem.
 However, we shall have to conduct any such discussion
 
absolutely independent of the Wenner
ren matter.
 I am not willing
 
to have your P
e rsonal regard for me, whatever it is, or your con-
corn over "ownership" of any portion of the American scene, enter
 
into a decision as to what you should say or not say to the '
renner-
(ren iouridation.
 It is for this reason that T have rotton in
 
tauch with Dr. Pejos, as I indicat'.d earlier.

Dear Bess,
 
Johnny sent me your long and very amusing family letter of
 
September 19.  
I am certainly glad to hear that Butch is feel-
ing better and that things are going reasonably well with you
 
ll.
 It's great -
-
ibout the refrigerator and the washing machine,
 
so nice to have prosperous and loving relatives.
 
This summer was a curious one.
 I finally worked myself into
 
what I suppose has been coming for a long while, and after I
 
finished a series of broadcasts in England, my insides just
 
went on a sit-down strike.
 I felt pretty bad for a while and
 
retired to a life of swimming and sleeping -
-
 in Mallorca and on
 
the Cape.
 I am just coming back into circulation now and in
 
about ten days will go to Philadelphia to be a sort of scholar-
in-residence in the University of Pennsylvania.  Perhaps you
 
didn't know that I had won an Americar?
.
 Council of Learned So-
cities fellowship for six month
's of study and research.
 It
 
looks like it will be maybe possible that other grants '
:ill come
 
along to s u
p l e m e n t  a n d  succeed this one so th at I will be able
 
to follow up the line suggested in my A. A. paper.
 
The book I worked on in
 
England,  The Folk Songs of North Ame ica, 
which runs about 700 pages of songs and comment,  came out there
 
in September to very good press and will be
-published here by
 
Doubleday in mid-November.
 It's full of nc;; ideas and I think
 
it will please some and annoy lots of others.
 You'll get your
 
copy in due course.
 By the way, if you have any suggestions
 
about people in the vicinity who could help the book on radio
 
or in the press,  send me their names and I will see that they
 
are covered.
 
Another nice bit of news is that Atlantic Records is bringing out
 
seven LP's of the stereo tapes I made with Shirley in the South
 
in the summer of '
59.  There are some very interesting new things
 
on these records and the sound should be really superb.
 You'll
 
get yours as they come out.
 
I am looking forward with great pleasure to a quiet year of read-
ing and writing.
 It's been due me a long
 time and perhaps some-
thing
 
good may come of it.  Please give my best to Butch and
 
hugs to your children, and remember me,
 
Your fond and devoted brother,

Dear Johnny, Margaret, Shirley, Chris and Al,
 
Enclosed are the pictures of Anne I promised you last Christmas.
 
They were taken during our vacation at Ponza, and they show what a lovely
 
and vivid child Anne is coming to be. I hope to bring her here to London
 
and put her in a good Lnglish school soon. Would you divide them up
 
and let us have some of your families.
 
t
 
Isn't there any way I can come off the
 black books?
 
Things seem to be about to go well with me. I have a contract
 
to do 20 records with an European record comoany and am about to sign
 
a longterm contract with the best of the television companies h
ere.
 
The Penguin anthology I 4r0te you about has now become two, and
 
they will be done this year.
 
Thanks for your good letter and keep me in touch with the news.
 
Mi ch love,
 
Alan

Dear Bess,
 
Ed Kahn will be taken care of by Doubleday.  Despite their somewhat
 
inept handling the book has sold about 11,000 copies and they are
 
confident it will continue to sell at this rate for some long time
 
to come.  I'm kind of surprised you didn't mention the map idea
 
which is really new in the field and I think r
.
oints the direction
 
for the future.  The principle professional ethnologist on American
 
matters looked at i
t and said, "This is the basic map of American
 
culture from the ethnological point of view."  He and I are setting
 
up a research project which will describe other parts of the world
 
in behavorial terms and should be getting well along with it in six
 
months.  Wish you were here so I could hire you.  The available
 
n
iisicologists are simply tied up in knots and I'm s
ick of pulling
 
at them instead of working with them.  As of March 1st I will be a
 
research associate at Columbia University with additional funds from
 
Rockefeller and the promise of more to come.  I'm also working on
 
setting up a Museum of Recorded Music which will be a base for me
 
and a research center for all sorts of people.
 
My best news at the moment is that today I have found a x
aisic teacher
 
who understands nr special problems and I'm happily hard at work with
 
him with secret plans to become a composer.
 
I loved the pictures of the kids and news of them.  Hope someday to
 
meet them face to face.  Give them and Butch my love.
 
Your everloving brother,

Dear Bess,
 
There is no deadline on the Bessie Jones material ex-
cept that it ought to be done as soon as possible so
 
as to protect her.
 12  you mill send a duplicate set
 
of the songs in batches of twenty-five at a time to
 
my agent, Paul Rosen, at 4
85 Madison Avenue, New York
 
City, he can copyright them in groups of twenty-five
 
and thus the material can move along step by step.
 
One thing must be quite clear:  It is extremely import-
ant that her songs not be taught anybody until they are
 
copyrighted in some way or other, because the uncon-
scious and intentional pirates are many.
 
My relationships with Hedy West are a little vague at
 
this point.  I sent her her first payment and a con-
tract and the records and have he --
--
-.
rd nothing.  I am
 
pretty worried and if it turns out that she is going
 
to welsh on the job it may be that I
'll ask you to take
 
my part and transfer the text to Victor Grauer, my
 
assistant of last s
ummer who lives in Venice, Califor-
nia.  Howsoever, I will know more about that by the end
 
of the meek i and if necessary will call you.  Meantime,
 
I am packing for the West Indies to leave within a few
 
days now.  Among the packing jobs will be to send you
 
Bessie's tapes.  Some of them are double track, most at
 
7.  Remember, I don't want Seeger-type transcriptions,
 
but simple transcriptions of the songs so that ordinary
 
humans can learn them.
 
Hastily and with love,

Dear Johnny,
 
A very mysterious, to me, series of communications
 
have turned up in my flies from the Republic National
 
Bank Trust Department.  They are entitled "
statements
 
of receipts and disbursements."  According to the last
 
one, the balance on the 31st of March was $8,000 odd.
 
There are disbursements of about $7,000 and there remains
 
a balance of about $18,000.  What is all this about?
 
I haven't answered your recent letter because lt'reached
 
me just before I left Jamaica and is still in customs
 
with the rest of my stuff.  I came home rather hurridly
 
because Anne had rather an upset at Bard and her doctor
 
decided it '
would be better for her to skip the first
 
term and that I ought to come back to look after her.
 
She's getting on beaufifu.11y, has started studying
 
Russian and Italian, and is living very happily here with
 
me in New York.  Meantime, I
've started to work on the
 
new book and various other projects.
 
My good news is that the g
rant came through, cut '
way
 
down but still $138,000 guaranteed for two years.  I
 
don't know '
whether to be pleased or scared, but anyway
 
it is the first time since I was in the Army that it's
 
been possible for me to think of as much as two years'
 
continuity.  It will probably make me into some sort of
 
horrible, s
tuffy conformist.
 
The family reunion you ran was a real '
wonderful occasion
 
for all of us and I hope we have another one before too
 
long.  In many '
ways the few quiet days in your house
 
afterwards were even nicer.  It is a lovely house, but
 
even better, is the almosphere of security, warmth and
 
human excellence that pervades the atmosphere.  You are
 
great people and I am proud to be related to you.
 
With much love from Toni, Anne and me,

Dear Bess,
 
As you probably know by no'
w, Anne had a rather severe upset in
 
her first two weeks at Bard and her doctor recommended that she
 
drop out of school for this semester.  She was doing very well in
 
her '
work but she was not happy at all.  She is now living with me
 
in New York and is recovering rapidly.  She is taking Russian and
 
Spanish, '
working hard at them and enjoying herself.
 A good, long,
 
'
warm, family letter from you would give her no end of a boost.
 
I came back f
rom Jamaica rather unexpectedly on account of this
 
problem and have been bust trying
 to re-organize my '
working life
 
since that time.
 
The grant from NINE has come through -
-
 $69,000 per year for two
 
years -
-
 a rather terrifying prospect for right now -
-
 all that
 
'
work and all that responsibility.
 
.
4 couple of very nice pieces have been '
written recently assessing
 
the Lomax contribution to American folklore.  One of these I
 
enclose.  It more or less answers the rather catty and unpleasant
 
things Wilgus said in his book.  The other is a review of "The
 
Folk Songs of North America" by David McAllister in the last
 
issue of ZJiL
irl
I think you will be very much pleased
 
by it, as I '
was.  If you have no '
way of getting a copy, I will try
 
to get  hold of one for you.
 
It was lovely to see you this summer.  I hope you are planning to
 
take that job in the University system.  You need the security,
 
the continuity and the leisure it will give you.  We Lomaxes
 
have to get it through our stubborn and prideful heads that '
we
 
simply cannot carry the burden of our own personal lives and the
 
responsibilities of everybody else's problems as well on no money
 
and no security.  Take the job and then do '
what extra you really
 
have time for.  Nobody '
will think any the less of you and you
 
will probably discover that you can use your time more effectively
 
when you can occasionally draw a long breath and look around.
 
My ACLS fello'
wship, when I had no responsibilities for a '
whole
 
year, really chanced my life because I had time to think.
 
Lots of love to you all from Toni, Anne and myself,
 
November 30, 1962
 
Dearest Bess,
 
Damn
 I
'm sorry that Sam Hinton is the source of the song.  He
 
has lifted so much stuff from my books with no acimo 1edgement
 
that it burns me to have to  i
rite and ask
 for the proper
 
credits.  But I
'm doing it, anyway.  If he mere reproducing pic-
tures from a fellow marine biologist, he would put in a long
 
footnote.  Why is he so goddamed irresponsible on his records?
 
Did you notice, for example, that he had heard an identical,
 
word-for-word, note-for-note version of "Whoa, Buck" from some
 
country boy in East Texas?  This song, text and tune, happens
 
to be a composite which I constructed at great pain from all
 
over the South.  Nayhe Sam follows me around in a time machine,
 
like Harry Jelafonte.  Anyway,  small matter.
 
How are you coming  ith the Bessie transcriptions?  I hope you
 
don't come up with a bill too soon because I am horribly broke,
 
but I thought I owed it to Bessie to ask.
 
If you get time, give Hedy West a pat on the head.  She's the
 
best transcriber and editor of tunes
 ever met -
-
 better
 
than all the Seegers compressed into one icicle.  But she's a
 
terribly distraught gal and might just go entirely to pieces one
 
fine day if she doesn't get some love, or better, some therapy.
 
By the way, in this regard, I hereby order you to slow do n now
 
or in the near future and get a little therapy, yourself.  You
 
are much too tired for the good of all the people who adore you
 
and will terribly miss you if you should get down s
ick.
 This
 
is an order and a warning from the source!
 
Did I tell you how fabulous I think your children are?  Just
 
about the nicest three I
've ever seen, and with the right 5oup 90n
 
of Lomax -
-
 thank God not too much of it, though.  I would say
 
large slathers of Butch, luckily for them.  It's really so mar-
velous that the girls can be so independent, organized, mature,
 
and such natural youngsters at the same time.
 
This is for your private eye,
 but I am at the moment having really
 
serious father problems.  Anne is behaving, thinking and feeling
 
part of the time like a twenty-two-year-older and the other part
 
of the time like she was about nine.  As I am the only relative
 
around, I am catching hell.  The fact that Anne is a lot smarter
 
than I am and also has more time to plan her dramas puts me at
 
quadruple disadvantage.  What I mean here is hat she has three or
 
four personalities to my rather battered one.  The flaming ques-
tion always hangs in the background, "Why weren't you there all
 
the time like you should have been?"  And, of course, until she's
 
about fifty,  she could never bear to hear the reason.
 
This is all much  i
ore cheerful than it actually reads because
 
Anne's getting better fast and the household refrain, "Nobody
 
loves me," is coming a little less frequently.  Toni '
s cooly
 
affectionate, objective and independent stance is helping no
 
end, of course.
 
-2-
Meantime, with my desk covered iith telephone messages from Anne's
 
boyfriends and the house in a state of seige for various reasons
 
a good part of the time, I am running at about half speed.  This
 
ain't good because I
've agreed to deliver this collection of 600
 
songs on January 1
, and I don't believe there are 600 good songs
 
left, including "Our Singing Country."  The fact that I finally
 
did a good book also is an obstacle since this one's got to be,
 
according to the American success drive, better, and it would
 
take me a year to do that.
 The Library of Congress, where I am
 
supposed to be getting the material, has no dubbing time and
 
they've recently thought up a way to double the costs, which
 
ere already excessive.
 
Meantime, my Cantometrics is beginning to make me into every-
body's favorite after dinner speaker.  The invitations are com-
posed of just those proportions of dear friendship and prestige
 
which make them impossible to turn down.
 And I am constructed
 
so that it takes me t o days to prepare emotionally for a speech
 
and two days
 to get over it.  l
lo,ever, since it appears to be
 
part of my destiny, I am accepting a lot of them and hoping that
 
I
'll get blithe, careless and tiresome like most other people.
 
I must stop this ramble and get down to work.
 
Remember  that you're a rock but that you need the right kind of
 
climate to weather in,  even so.
 
Much love from your affectionate brother,
 
P. S.  The letters to Anne  1
ere import rit.  Send her a crazy
 
post card if you're too busy.
 
January 2
, 1963
 
Dear Bess,
 
Your Christmas package was a real mine of delight for us all, and
 
I feel a little ashamed that ours wasn't so lavish.  Actually,
 
the pictures were rather expensive when I covered the '
whole
 
family with gets, but as Nicky's were so good, I felt that he'd
 
rather stolen my thunder.
 Anyway, there'll soon be records along
 
and other publications and I hope you'll take a rain check until
 
then, as we are a bit broke.
 
I keep hearing about you from all the people who journey East
 
from the West Coast, so I judge you are still wheeli
4 46ly-burly 
and deal-
ing in a big way.  I
've '
withdrawn entirely from the 
 
of folk music and everybody thinks I
'm an awful old meany because
 
I have lost interest in it.  But I did put in almost twenty
 
years of looking after singers and their problems, and it seems
 
to me that somebody else can take on this job now; in fact, they
 
have.
 
How are you getting on with Bessie's songs?  Typically, I have
 
heard nothing more from the Belafonte group '
which had expressed
 
an interest, but as soon as I have the music, I
'll do something
 
about the whole business.  At least I
'll get the c
ollection copy-
righted and protect it for her.
 
The old '
wind has out down on us from the north pole and the town
 
is shivering and gloomy like a '
whipped cur in the corner.  At
 
least that's the '
way I feel.  I will therefore close in thelope
 
that things are better with you.
 
Much love, and attached check,
 
couldn't shake.  Also, the tempo of work has been extremel-y
 
fast as I am -oushinF
, hard to get the utmost out of this

p4ves me a rou;h picture of performance  nructure for any piece
 
of music I listen to.
 I have s
teady results for Africa, Western
 
urope, Central Europe, the Orient,  hustralia, Polynesia, two
 
for American Indians, etc.
 In other words, I think I have found
 
a way of roughly classifying and describing folk music which will
 
work for almost all the material, and work every time.
 It has
 
both the virtues and the limitations of a first rough approach,
 
but using it one can really talk sensibly and at length about
 
most of the factors and sets of faotors that operate vt
henevcr
 
people make music.
 
Lots of love,

Dear Shirley,
 
I am sure you had a great Christmas with your children in Moline.
 
Had a nice time at our house, the presents being capped by two
 
fur coats, one for Toni and one for Anne.  Just at Christmas I
 
discovered there is a store here in town that dials in reconditioned
 
furs -
-
 in fact, there are 70,000 of them on one floor -
-
 and if
 
you look hard enough you can find something real good.  Toni got
 
Japanese mink, real elegant, needing only a new lining to make
 
it look worth several thousand dollars.  I bought a racoon for
 
Anne, but she's refused to wear it up to now, even though she
 
looks marvelous in it.  I suppose it has all kinds of Freudian
 
implications for her and that probably we'll have to take it
 
back and get something much soberer for her.  Keep this in mind,
 
however, if you ever decide to deal in fur coats on a lar ee
 
scale.  Nothing over $35.00 in the whole place, including beaver.
 
The great event of Anne's fall (including her analysis) is her
 
driver's license.  I bought another ancient Buick, this time
 
l95+, for  $150.00.
 It runs like a '
watch and it's built like a
 
tank.  Anne spends most of her time either driving or thinking
 
about driving it.  A couple of '
weeks ago she w
ent with me on a
 
lecture trip to Indiana and she drove from Newark to Akron without
 
taking her hands off the wheel, talking like a maniac the '
whole
 
'
way.  But Lord God, aren't eighteen-year-old girls a pain to
 
live vithl  Since they are the perfection of nature  they look
 
down upon all the rest of the world from a dizzy height and with
 
a scorn-curled lip.  I
'm afraid I react as badly to this as my
 
father did in his time.  I roar, bellow, '
whine, grow reasonable,
 
but the implacable and cruel tide of youth flows caliny on,
 
mindless of my hurt feelings.
 
I made some inquiries about the Washington t
raining program in
 
psychotherapy and discovered what I heard about was a pilot pro-
gram involving only a small number of people, '
which is now being
 
evaluated by a study committee.  At the moment there is no cur-
rent training program.  Alo±ig about the end of February, and then
 
full-time from March on, I will be constantly with people in the
 
social s
ciences.  If you could tell me by that time what it is
 
that you have in mind for yourself to do, I will really work on
 
finding out '
where you ought to go for training or look for a job.
 
I ree ll, when I asked an eminent analyst
 in regard to Anne '
what
 
she should do to get ready for training as an aia1yst,
 she said,
 
"Have as '
wide a life experience as possible."  Of course, you have
 
had that in a '
way.  It seems to me that the only thing you lack
 
is the kind of sophistication that all-Americans need -
-
 expec-
ially middle-western Americans -
-
 in moving around across cul-
ture lines.  If you had behind you a six-months' sojourn in
 
Europe at this stage in your growth and spoke at least something
 
of one foreign language, I think you '
would be much further along
 
in the direction you '
want to go. Besides which, you need the
 
experience for its own sake.
 
-2-
I am as usual shoulder-deep in papers, projects and all sorts of
 
obligations.
 I have a lousy mid-winter cold and an awful yearn-
ing to go to bed, which I am now going to do.  It's been marve-
lous to read your letters on the family circuit and to hear that
 
you are doing so well, even in the midst of your harried job.
 
Come to see us if you ever want another kind of harriedness in
 
your life.
 
In the meantime, remember me, your ever-loving brother,
 
P. S.  Enclosed is royalty check.  I am going to arrange for
 
the amount to be paid to you and the others directly from now
 
on.

April 24, 1963
 
Dear Bess,
 
You'll have to forgive me for not writing you promptly about the
 
transcriptions. Victor and I looked over them and they looked
 
very good, but I'll have to postpone my comments until another
 
day.  I have been working very hard and am not very well and
 
right now t
iaere is a tremendous demand on my time so that 1 can
 
never finish anything.
 I suppose you know that situation.
 
t
hat I have to get to is  Bessie Jones' immediate problem.  At-
tached are the contracts which she sent me for inspection.  I
 
don't feel, on the whole, that these are very adeq.uate.dOculf
lef
lts.
 
If •d keeps managing her, it seems to me that he should have
 
better contracts for her than .
Letters saying that she is involved
 
in such-and-such a date because she is carrying five people all
 
over the country and messes can be involved, as you know.
 
Second, it seems to me that the fees that Ed is now paying her
 
are too low for iive people, and the lowest one is for their
 
week's engagement at  
Ed's 'own club.  I told him over the 'phone
 
in a mild sort of way what I thought about this, and I only hope
 
that we can increase the size golden egg without killing the
 
goose.  Also, their fee for their appearance at the UCLA Polk
 
Festival is low for five people, when they are going to occupy
 
such an important part of the prdgram.  As I see it, they are
 
going to make about 14 1000 for a total of almost three months
 
Wa  I)
MA  494e p v4.teti
 is an average qf 5
j800 apiece.  If you
 
subtract  250.00 for just their transportation, that leaves them
 
$600 clear for three months, which is t200 a month, and not very
 
high pay.  Bessie has got to learn how to think this say.
 
There are
 couple of minor points.  First is about the movie.
 
Their Sl,000 fee should not represent outright sale to the
 
University.
 They should retain their rights in the film if
 
it is used for any kind of taeatrical or television distrib-
ution.  No artist should ever sell anything outright when he
 
is being paid wages for his time.
.
 The final point is about
 
recording at the Festival.  I think there will be albums coming
 
out of these affairs and they should have a regular royalty agree-
ment for their participation in the albums, completely apart from
 
their participation in the festivals.  I think this is agreed,
 
but it must be spelled out before they are recorded.
 
d tells me that he is going to make up to them for giving them
 
a low weekly salary at the Ash Grove by furnishing lodging be-
tween May 19 and June 11.
 This ought  o oe checked.
 
Bess, you cannot overemphasi e with this group the importance
 
of their sticking exactly to the music and movement model that
 
they have had established for them in their coo
imunity, and you
 
should really raise hell if they depart from it in the least bit.
 
AS you work with them,  .
t
hey are going to cons antly uncover new
 
-2-
more interesting material,  out this mus  be stylisticaJJy consonant
 
with the old for you to accept it.
 There is no reason in the
 
world why John and .es ie and the group cannot learn to under-
stand the levels of authenticity and time depth that their mater-
ial represents.
 ThiS will protect them from becoming acculturated
 
any more rapidly than will happen in the normal course of things.
 
I think you should do everything possible to push John to be more
 
of a leader of the group in terms of decisions about dates, fin-
ances, etc.  I also think that Bessie should not do all the
 
MCing, because she is apparently talking more and more, and this
 
is one of the chief barriers between the group and their public.
 
I suspect that Henry would make a good, quiet announcer of tunes,
 
and I suggest that you try him out at this for some of the smaller
 
dates.
 
I am going right now to a meeting about a Negro folk touring
 
company to go to Europe following the successful heels of the
 
"Black Nativity" group.  If this works out, I think it is going
 
to furnish a long period of employment for Bessie and other Negro
 
artists.
 
Please forgive the unbrotherly tone of this letter, but I am
 
making it all business -
-
 personal affairs during the next few
 
days.  Our house is now big enough to accommodate one or two
 
more Lomaxes at a time, and we would love to hear from you all.

iho ovnz and directs s
everal black s

tations.
 
L
ouis Prank, a
 well-known Public Relations man
,, is also advising.  I have permission of
 
'
olui ia University to send out a l
etter on their s
tationery announcing the availability
 
of this transcription containing approximately forty one-minute spots researched by
 
J
ohn Henrik Clarke, Raoul Abdul, and members of vw staff.  If t
his idea proves to be at-
tractive, 3
 • Welter Thompson can still interest and pay for the time .
 In any event, vs
 
expect the spots to be so attractive that they '
wi l
l be used by the stations a
tqv a
y as
 
art of their educational obligations to the FCC and to the public.
 
This series w
ill contain at least f
ifteen spots about the bleak *zsical

t to naks
 
points about the longevity of Negro cultural history, about basic African geogra h3?,
 
about Africa* s
ocial s
tyle, as well as about the special 1ua1iti5s of African music.
 
I think you will be delighted when you hear these spots.  When this part of the work is
 
done, I an ping to try one of the big record c
ompanies out on the notion of putting out
 
a record which deals in this extremely popular way '
with Negro cu
ltural history through

I guess I
'm too much in the middle of the work on the whole system
 
to want to parcel it out in unfinished condition to anybody now.
 
I think we could help Naomi later in the year to develop a good
 
system for observing animal behavior but this ought to be done in
 
a normal and straitforward, collaborative way.
 Tell her from me
 
that I think the big job that needs to be done right this minute
 
is to develop a reply to Lorenz & Company.  Their books, supposedly
 
based on good ethnology and archeology have become the spine of the
 
philosop1iy of all the hawks  of this country--a bunch of very dangeu-
ous/
S * reaten the future of mankind.
 I am going to tell her that
 
I think she ought to
 her colleagues and see what they
 
feel about all this because  hey have never replied to these people
 
in public and thus we are being defeated by our own material and
 
our own ideas--a painful business.

I am taking the good copy of the film to Mexico for a week of con-
ferences, and the second copy I will cut to pieces.
 So, I am
 
sending you another film, a little bit more esoteric but maybe all
 
the more interesting.
 
It is about how dances can be viewed as a way of presenting the
 
erogenous and vulnerable central zones of the bod -
h  t
!h-c.

. -.  Therefore, a solo dancer grinding her hips counts
 
as solo erogenous, while a group of dancers grinding their hips
 
count as-presenting the belly.
 
Enclosed is a copy of the script.  You had better go over it once,
 
because some of the titles are out of place on this rough copy.
 
hope your kids will enjoy it.
 
We are trying but there is still no news of the microphone.

written to reassure the young ones.

 once the hideout of
 
pirates, now the habitat of f

thir
i 15 to 50 miles offshore, and  form the
 
paradise Carol has brought me, too. You  remember the
 
pleasures of the coast south of Cancun. We have found Lhc

:
haded, sandy i
sles where the same  Barrier reef that we

 again, conveniently,curls white
 
just a few hudred yards off shore.  I always thought that
 
P

arrived.
 
First, you're at sea, with a sea-breeze alvap
 
blows or s

the islands are very small, and there are almost no cars.
 
Everyone--everyone is barefoot--walking sandy roads,

hound to the reef for f
ishing or diving.
 
Third,these villages are  prosperous, ftc
 
c
atch cooperatively sold to the RED LOBSTER chain at a
 
price, and with bits of  tourism thrown in .
 The social air
 
is  mild in the extreme; there '
s the wonderful mood of
 
natural
 shyness,
 lots of friendliness. The population is
 
r
ajorly Spanish speaking--a meztizo mix of Mayan and
 
Mosquito -
--smallish, quiet, extremely gentle and quick and
 
refined. The new black population, recently arrived from
 
barifuna land to the south,  is also quiet, sailorly, theii
 
natural ebullience somewhat held in check by the calm styh
'c
 
of their Mayan meztozo neighbors. But ther mix of black adds
 
sauce to the otherwise often too placid Latin atmosphere.

You will forgive me for my long silence, but I have been absolutely overwhelmed
 
with work for the last three months.  Also, for the first time in my life, I
 
have been taking week-ends off and going out to a house I have rented on Long Island
 
--swimming and reading through the entire week-end.  When you come by New York,
 
I hope you will hole up there for a while and cool off in the calm of day.  My
 
life is not the conventional one carried out by members of the establishment in
 
Lubbock, but if you can put w up with that, we ought to be able to have very happy
 
times together.
 
Ann is established in her own apartment with a girl friend xii and has a very
 
interesting and very tough job--also getting ready to go to Columbia next fall.
 
She is in great shapes-so am I

 If you can wangle a dinner invitation at their home, I would guarantee
 
you a great evening.  He is in New York at the moment, leaving tomorrow, but I will

In relationship to presentations of folk performance for the public, i
t seems
 
to me that there are a number of approaches, each one of which i
s good on i
ts
 
own, and each one of which is capable of being combined with the others in
 
a
ll sorts of ways to produce a great number of textures.
 
1
)  The Making of an Environment. This idea i
s beautifully exemplified
 
in the 1o*th Carolina festival that was laid out l
ike a map of the state
 
where the audience was then enveloped by the folklore of the s
tate and made
 
a point-to-point visit to i
t, eating, watching, perhaps participating.  An
 
even more beautiful example of this was the Festival of India at the
 
Smithsonian where two environments were used, one inside the Museum a kind
 
of "
living" museum, the other outside on the Mall, a piece of the Indian
 
environment reconstructed through i
ts quintessentially exciting performance
 
moments.  In a way, this pleases me the most because here the audience comes
 
face to face with a culture close at hand within the magic circle of a kind
 
of theatrical mock-up of the environment that produced i
t,
 
ita
Ed

2
)  Dramatization. In my view, very l
ittle work i
s ever done with the performers
 
bemselyes in
. order to make it possible for them to discover, in their own
 
background and talents, the tx

dialogue and presentational ideas that would make them able to present as
 
actors the war t
iIei
'r culture works -
-
 the ideas and emotions that are within i
t.
 
Here the pe  orniances of Leadbelly and Woody Guthrie, which I had a lot to do
 
With, are examples
 Nobody understood Leadbelly's songs, so we said, you'd
 
better explain them, and then Leadbelly developed a talking, chanting s
tyle
 
that annotated t
ile- songs, putting them into an environment.  He also used
 
an axe and a hoe to demonstrate the work songs; he also danced.  Woody's
 
performances were so full of good talk about Oklahoma and the weary ways of
 
the world that the songs almost disappeared at times.  In one place he never
 
got around to singing till the evening was almost over.
 
But what would interest me more is interaction between the people in the cast
 
Ean
. McColl and Bert Lloyd and I ased to put on ballad-singing contests where
 
,  topic was suggested and we had to come up with something interesting
 
often not singing the whole song even.  This was for a fairly sophisticated
 
audience.  On the other hand, there is the improvising of new songs in the
 
varied s
tyles of rhymed couplets or verses, or such forms as fiddling contests,
 
the product of some folk traditions.
 
Beyond that of course i
s the working out of dialogue between the members of a
 
good troupe.  The Irish do i
t '
very well; Anna Chai'retakis is hrixgixg beginning
 
i
t with the I
talian groups but i
t needs
- much much more work.  All these people
 
are natural actors; all are just waiting to have the opportunity.  Winston
 
Fleury made an acting company out of two-dozen working-class people from
 
Carriacou,  The Garifuna (
from Belize now living in New York) have dramatiz d
 
their music on stage by chopping down an imaginary tree and turning i
t into a
 
canoe with songs all the way,  There's much to do here and you need to have
 
rehearsal time built in.
 
3
)  The Annotated Concert. Here much can be done with program booklets
 
giving background with perhaps one or two presenters.  First and foremost,
 
the Cantometric and Choreometric characteristics of the perromance can
 
yield rich requards for the audienc, showing what i
s African, what i
s
 
European, what i
s Latin about the performances.  A great deal of this wk
 
work i
s done already, existing in my catalogues :
ka of s
tyle.  I can send you
 
some pages of what Forrestine and r
 have done in annotating American jazz
 
performance, both music and dance.
 Barry Ancelet
 
has the material r
 did on Cajun music which i
s, I think, pretty good.  Here
 
we give the audience characteristics to look for that they can actually see
 
and hear for themselves -
-
 the degree of overlapping, the kinds of dynamics
 
used, the length of phrases -
 all this is easily described and can go into
 
booklets in brief form that can accompany performances.
 
In addition to this, of course, there i
s the normal folklore material, something
 
of the ethnology, so that each tour could be accompanied by X=x a s
ort of
 
a handbook to give the audience resources useful for understnading what i
t's
 
l
ooking at,  Commentators can also draw from this source, because not all the
 
audience will actually read the booklet, until them perhaps are s
timulated to
 
do s
o.
 
There i
s a big opportunity here -
-
 something i
t seems to me you could work
 
But with NEl
l for themes and culture strains.  When I put on the Midnight
 
Special concert series at Town F
lail, I generally gathered things together in
 
terms of some thematic idea such as ballads, or blues or whatnot.  I think
 
my best was the Carnegie Hall one where I focused on all the x urban forms
 
that had grown up.  I think these sorts of frameworks are always good, but they
 
depend a good deal on professionals or semi-professionals rather than the folks.
 
These national tours
- that you're taking around -
_
 i
t seems to me that they have
 
not altogether lived up to their prom ise because no one tells any of the
 
poignant and dramatic and politically hot stories in the backgrounds of the
 
groups ,
 The presentations are -
rather abstract, and I really feel that the
 
presenters have not worked hard enough on telling the story of each of these
 
groups in America and in their original homes, so that the audience can really
 
appreciate the historical and cultural importance of each: the s
truggles of the
 
I
rish, the terrifying poverty of the Mediterranean world, the fruition of
 
contribution of each of these peoples to the growth of the United Sttates.
 
These things are hardly mentioned.  They should be, so that the l
ore i
tself
 
conies to stand for an aesthetic achievement of a people who are, l
ike every
 
group, fighting for their live
-s.
 
Look what's happening in Fiji now.  We are looking with distaste at the Fijians
 
who are trying to protect their l
ittle bit of land and their basically simple
 
sharing culture from the ravages of the extremely aggressive, extremely
 
advanced and complex, extremely highly organized Hindus who are eating up the
 
Fijian world because tkey happened to get transported there by the ever-messy
 
British mingi colonial system.  Fijians are fighting for their culture; they
 
have only a little bit of land to support i
t, and the Indians will certainly
 
smother them if Fijians don 't do something absolutely drastic,  Now this i
s
 
true for every group you've got
 I think this is gki highly dramatic, and
 
these stories need telling -
-
 a
long with the singing -
-
 somehow.
 
I
'll try to dig up the memo that t never sent to Ralph as a result of my
 
thoughts about the Festival of India two years ago, but there i
s one thing
 
certain: all the festivals are over-waidked.  The performers are absolutely
 
ham-strung by a festoon of stiff, rigid, upright l
inear things (
very
 
northwest European) called microphones which restrict their movement and
 
make it impossible for them to look or be themselves.  You've got to get
 
miking equipment set to do away with these awful things,  There are many
 
possibilities that are available now, and they have got to be a part of the
 
investment of our presentation of the people.
 
Until that's done, really the best thing to do is to go back to small environ-
ments for the music so that i
t can be heard just they way i
t i
s and s
o that
 
the audience and the singers can be close to each other, staging festival
 
pieces or episodes and small concerts like the Indians did i
t at the Smith-
sonian,  There are lapel mkes or various combinations of overhead and f
loor
 
mikIng that would leave performers free to move around to do their stuff and
 
still be heard,  B
tmt now they' re never really seen properly because they can't
 
move.  They have to sit or stand there l
ike pokers, and that's not the way
 
folk music l
ived except in northwest Europea where i
t didn't have any room,
 
where it occurred in wintry environments right in front of the fire.
 
4
)  Electronic, computerized, artifical environments. That is the problem
 
that  aro1 K
ii,ig is working on and knows a great deal about.  Here we surround
 
and support the perrormance by s
lide shows, bits of projected films, song
 
texts, translations of dialogue coming from all sorts of newfangled e
lectronic
 
gadgets
 r'ii  sure that what Carol is developing will become a part of many
 
many performing groups in the future.
 I
t will give such groups all sorts of
 
dimensions that they, couldn't otherwise have with films and s
lides projecting
 
pictures of the environment that the material actuall comes from.  I think
 
you should have Carol down to talk to your group or you should get her to write
 
you a piece or something.
 
I hope this has all been helpful,

Thank you again for the Robbins contact. Choreometrics
 
could lead to a new lease on life for choreography--not to say
 
dance criticsm. But god know whether it will lead to anything.
 
Forrestine keeps pushin me and pushin me--never remembers that
 
she mostly exists as apublic figure because of our collaboration,
 
and keeps demanding and demanding and leaves me wishing I
'd
 
never invited her in,  had chosen Irmgaard who knows when to stop,
 
or had worked on something else besides dance. Ztm
 
The scripts are finished and recorded--they have some re
 
really bmax beautiful and charming spots---spots that cost me
 
very dear,  very dear.  I hope they're worth it.  It was nice this
 
morning to call NSF and tell them the end was  in sight and
 
hear how happy they were.  I'll be showing them in Washington
 
in December--if I live and the machines don' t
 break down.
 
Anne is  looking happier--she's calm and growing calmly.
 
She looked so happy when she told me the other  day that Bill's
 
headaches are disappearing,because he is more relaxed--and I could
 
tell that she thought she had a
:* lot to do with that.
 
Enclosed is the piece I wrote in Sudan--make a copy
 
if you want to keep it. I think it's the first plan like this
 
ever made for a whole country. We could make one for America--
might take two weeks,  instead of one.
 But this is between us.

UNITY AND DIV R ITY -A  JDA
   CJLTUP L PROGRAM
 
by Alan Lomax
 
The recent history of mankind has been characterized by
 
the destruction of cultures.  Once this process was caused
 
by military and economic imperialism.  Lately the cause
 
has shifted to the over-centralization of communication and
 
education systems, which render local cultures passive and
 
silent.
 
The newly modernizing countries have the opportunity
 
to learn from the mistakes of Europe and Asia and to b
ii1d
.
 
multi-civilizations -
 nations with a strong center, supported
 
by the loyalty of a fascinating and ever-creative core of
 
varied cultures.  Modern Sudan, drawing upon the ancient
 
lessons of the Kingdom of Puij and the tolerance for which the
 
Arab tradition has always been distinguished, can weld
 
its unparalleled diversity into such a multi-civilization.
 
Its borders contain the whole range of African cultural
 
variety, North to South, East to West.
 This cultural richness
 
is certainly its greatest natural resource.  It means that
 
for every task there is a requisite temperament, for every
 
emergency there is the needful cultural depth and flexibility.
 
greatest treasure is his varied creation of life-
styles, by means of which he adapted to all the earth's
 
environments; his varied repretoire of languages and expressive
 
systems which enable him to handle his problems symbolically
 
in a virtually endless variety of manners, far beyond the
 
range of any conceivable computer.
 Sudan, with its hundreds
 
1
0
 
2
 
of tribal and local cultures, coming from many different
 
traditions, and its multitude of languages and artistic
 
heritages has resources, culturally speaking, that are hardly
 
exceeded anywhere else,  Beneath this variety there are many
 
ancient lines of kinship to be found upon which a natural
 
unity can be based.
 Therefore Sudan should boldly develop
 
its diversity, knowing that by keeping this national treas re
 
of expressivity, ingenuity, and adaptability alive, while
 
modernizing, unforseen future growth will be possible.
 
Who knows which of Sudan's many languages might prove mos t
 
useful to some future development in computation, for exa
i.. iT
h?
 
There is another side to this coin.
 In modernizing it is
 
important not to damage the people, who after all must suffer
 
the effects of change.  All sectors of the population should
 
move ahead with full c
onfidence in their heritage, pride
 
in their ancestors and a sense of who they are as well as
 
who they are becoming.  Because of the dizzying effect pro-
duced by centralized communication systems  of national
 
education systems that bring in new standards to isolated
 
communities, and of the growth of cities and the rapid
 
movement of populations, many individuals and localities may
 
suffer psychic and cultural damage that threatens not only
 
them but also the nation.  Life in the local community and
 
in the family circle can lose its value and not be replaced
 
by any sound and rewarding values developed in the cities,
 
so that the impetus to work, to study, to grow, to procreate,
 
and to develop dimif
liSh.
 This has occurred in many developing
 
countries; the same phenomenon accounts for the feelings of
 
despair and anomie that afflict the rapidly industrialized
.
 
C
 
)
 
nations like Sweden, Germany and particularly the U.S.
 
Some of the Arab countries have experienced this within a
 
generation.
 Sudan, a land with a fresh, vital, and vigorous
 
population of peasants and pastoralists, notorious for their
 
vitality, their vigorous folk art and their boundless enthusiasm
 
for life, must plan to head in a different direction.
 The
 
pages that follow contain some practi al suggestions for
 
this plan.
 I have preferred to list them in brief numbered
 
paragraphs, rather than to develop any in detail, since I
 
am not sure which of them could be implemented first.  However,
 
certain general principles apply all the way through.
 
1)  The main threat to local cultures comes from the
 
centralized communication systems (TV, radio, records)
 
and from centralized education systems.
 It is not usually
 
realized that these two systems carry mainly the ideas and
 
standards of one central Westernized culture and relentlessly
 
impose them on all the localities they penetrate.  The result
 
is that the local traditions of communication and the
 
local artists are sooner or later put out of business;
 
the loudspeaker takes the place of the local bard; the
 
school teacher replaces the parents and the grandparents.
 
Our plan must modify these bad effects, while realizing
 
the benefits of both systems.
 
2
)
 These forces, supported by the development of econom-
ic dependency on distant capitals, reduces the autonomy
 
of the locality, until it becomes an unattractive and
 
unrewarding place to live.  As local entertainment and
 
tradition is killed off the community loses its charms;

people leave it for the city; or they remain but with
 
feelings of dissat sfaction.
 These conditions loom on
 
the horizon for Sudan, as it moves into rapid development.
 
The question, as Sudan develops its agricultural resources,
 
will become how to keep the morale of agricultural workers
 
high?  There is a parallel question, which also faces
 
every nation in the world; how to stave off over-crowding
 
and ruin in the big cities.
 The answer is obviously
 
the enrichment of life at the periphery -
 or rather
 
maintaining the wealth of local cultures and encouraging
 
their growth.
 
3
)  The answers to these problems can come, as work in
 
many countries shows us, by a) giving all the cultural
 
interests and traditions in the nations an equable share
 
of broadcast and school room time so that their need for
 
self-expression, feedback and perpetuation may be met, b)
 
providing rewards and facilities and attention for all
 
the expressive, artistic and communicative traditions,
 
most especially by recognizing the artists in all their
 
traditions,
 c)  by making anthropolOgists, folklorists
 
and ethnomusicologists responsible for this delicate work
 
because they know how traditions live and grow in their
 
different ways, and are the best -equipped to act as their
 
guardians, critics and protectors, when needed, d) by
 
emphasizing audio-visual devices in all this work.
 The
 
oral, non-verbal folk and popular traditions, of which
 
Sudan has such a rich store, are best recorded, fed-back,
 
preserved, transmitted and studied in the form of records
 
and films.

and sound in the capital and in the cultural centers of the
 
provinces where the w
I
' le art of the people can be kept
 
accessible to them and to the scholars, the savants and
 
the artists who will want to make use of  them.
 
5
)
 The expressive aspect of culture -
 song, dance,
 
design, tale, ritual, language, handicraft, custom, and
 
the like -
 symbolizes the whole.
 Thus a people need not
 
continue every practice of the past or retain outworn
 
ideas or customs, in order to maintain a healthy sense
 
of identity and pride; this may be provided in all or part
 
of their inherited symbolic systems.  A musical tradition,
 
a way of moving, a cooking style, a language may carry
 
out all or part of this cultural continuity.
 
For this reason, the expressive traditions must be emphasized.
 
Thus I feel sure that the Department of Culture has this
 
in mind as it develops its plans and builds its cultural
 
centers.  I must say I am astonished at how modern and forward-
looking the thinking  and the plans of the Sudanese
 
are in these respects.
 I can only supplement, crystallize
 
and support the developments already in the works.
 
6
)  In this field I am weary of the word "preserve".
 This
 
is something we do with the dead relics of t
1e past.
 
The Sudan's pop u
lar traditions are alive.
 They merely
 
need room, cdt'e, support and critical attention in order
 
to coninue to flourish and to grow and, of course, to change.
 
In later pages we will  come to some specifics about
 
"preservation" but first let us talk about development.

TEE FUNDAMENTALS OF TEE PLAN FOR CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
 
or CULTURAL ECOLOGY
 
1) EDUCATION -
 primary and secondary.
 The poetry, music,
 
dance, art, language, and history of the locality and the
 
region must be taught in the local and regional schools,
 
and be given a dignified place alongside other subjects.
 
The instruction can be carried on by the traditional
 
artists and histori a
ns, themselves.  Part of the develop-
ment of every school child and of every school as a cultural
 
c ntei
' should be the recording and the writing down
 
of this ocean of human creativity. Here guidelines should
 
be distributed to all teachers on how to initiate the program,
 
and folklorists and anthropologists should go into the
 
schools to set the program in motion.
 The literature,  
art, and music of early education would be primarily -
the local traditions, taught by the local experts.
 
2
) COMMUNICATION -
 insofar as radio and TV reach the masses
 
of Sudanese, care must be taken that all cultures so
 
reached are recognized by some amount of serious program-
ming in which the best and most important aspects of their
 
culture get time on the air.  When a people or a culture
 
is left out of an important communication system, trouble
 
ensues
 Man is the communicating animal and must have
 
access.  to all the systems he knows about. Under separate
 
heads -
 radio, TV, film -
 more detailed recommendations
 
will be made, in later pages.
 
3
) LANGUAGES -
 Man, especially African man,has a natural
 
aptitude for languages.
 There is no reason that every child
 
on his way up cannot acquire fluency and grace in three
 
or four or even five languages.
 Since so many languages
 
exist D  the Sudanse,  environment, there is no reason
 
that the child should not be aided to do what delights
 
him -
 to keep up his own family and tribal language,
 
to learn Arabic and perhaps English, and then pick up
 
another language or so from strangers or traders or
 
other linguistic minorities in his communities.
 This
 
will make him much more likely to succeed in his multi-
tongued world; and again the cost to the state would
 
be nihil; a teacher's guide wo u
ld be the main expense.
 
The low cost of teachers drawn from the community is a
 
factor to be considered.
 
4) HOUSING -
 Modernization often brings people from comfort-
able vernacular housing into hideous and unhealthy shacks,
 
shanties or tenaments.
 Sudan has a heritage of traditional
 
housing styles, all based on needs of local climates
 
and made of available local materials.
 There is no need
 
to import expensive iron and cement when the material
 
for better housing is at hand in most communities.
 The
 
school of vernacular architects, headed by El Pahti,
 
the prophet of home-made housing for the poor, whose
 
headquarters are in Cairo and who has carried out his
 
most successful experiments in the Nubian desert, has the
 
answers.
 Communites that are healthy, delightful to look
 
at and to live in, and extremely cheap can be built by
 
the people themselves, using native skills, led by these
 
(j1
 
architects.  Moreover, their knowledge brought to the
 
local community through field-workers can improve even
 
these without losing the ancient and often unrecaptu
.rable
 
beauty of many of these tribal centers.
 
5
) FOOD, the CUISINE -
 Almost everything we eat was dis-
covered in ancient times by unknown women, gatherers and
 
planters, and almost all the dishes and beverages, the
 
flavors and savors and spicy recipes were designed by
 
women anxious to please their husbands.
 In other words
 
our cuisines are folk creations; and it is being discovered
 
that folk diets are generally very nutrious and healthy as
 
well. It is most important that we do not lose this most
 
delicious of all human treasures in the rush to the
 
supermarket; it is imperative, for instance, that the
 
use of powdered milk and milk substitutes should be dis-
couraged, where proper sanitary conditions are not possible.
 
Specifically, the schools, the field-workers, the cultural
 
centers of Sudan should study and document and
. celebrate
 
Sudan's cuisines; and native cooks should be praised
 
and noticed and the festive customs of eating and drinking
 
that add savor to the life of every community should be
 
carried forward and not be replaced by Pepsi and burgers,
 
the twin plagues of the west.  A series of native cook-
books must be compiled.
 
6
)  CRAFTS, ENDANGERED SKILLS -
 The people should be
 
encouraged to make use of as many of their local products
 
as possible, and standards should be kept high.
 Thus
 
local life will be enriched by objects of beauty; local
 
0
 9
 
artists will be encouraged and paid to continue to excerciz
 
their skills and their fantasies; and an enormously valuable
 
surplus will be available for export.
 One of the most
 
important functions of the field worker will be to en-
courage the best of local craftsmen to buy good pieces
 
for the centers, to set the highest standards and to
 
protect the folk artist from the rip-off of the primitive
 
art buyer. If this matter is handled properly, it can
 
bring wealth to the locality and the country.  Here I
 
recommend that an international expert like Ted Carpenter
 
be called in to help to set up policy.  Where it is possible
 
that hand-skills and manufacturing techniques might be
 
lost these should be carefully documented, using film
 
where possible.  More important however, is bringing attention
 
and reward to the local craftsmen so"that apprentices
 
will be eager to acquire his skills and his expertise.
 
Central to this is that the community itself become
 
aware of th value of its own craft traditions -
 and here
 
again the media, the schools, but above all the cultural
 
field worker, operating through the center, is crucial.
 
7) MBDICINE -
 Science has increasingly discovered
, its
 
limitations for healing and has continued
, to acq
,uire
 
respect for the folk practitioner.  Only last year in
 
New York the major find
, of
.-psychiatry was that the spiritu-
alist cults of the Puerto Ricans operated with roughly
 
the same set of hypotheses and curative techniques as
 
did
, the psychoanalysts in dealing with mental patients - 
only the names and
, the rationale differed.  Nowadays
 
in modern ps1r&i
t
,ry in many areas of mixed urban cultures,
 
0
 
10
 
the psychiatrist and the folk healer work hand in hand
 
in healing mentally upset patients.
 Sudan would be wise,
 
therefore, to take advantage of its ancient heritage of
 
understanding about mental illness and move to support
 
the village practices in dealing with neuroses and mental
 
illness.  Here again major economies can be forseen.
 
By following the example of modern China and a number of
 
other countries, the national health service can work
 
cooperatively with the native practicioners, bringing
 
them into the national medical .
system as participants
 
rather than antagonists.  A system of training for the
 
establishment of rural semi-professionals to work as
 
adjunct medical care personnel should, it seems to me,
 
become part of the plan of national development.  Due
 
respect for the knowledge of native pharmacopia, native
 
healing techniques, moving alongside a major effort in
 
eradicating endemic disease would
' be beneficial both to
 
the nation and to the local culture.  Here ag n the mediation
 
of the anthropologi t would be a first step;
 field
 
work by trained personnel being most necessary.
 The
 
goal, as all through this paper, local self-sufficiency - 
supportive of national self-sufficiency.
 
8) WO
N AND HOME LIFE -
 Recent finding in social science
 
have drawn attention to an all-too-obvious, but all-too-
frequently-neglected fact that women make up more than
 
fifty percent of the world's adult population, that they
 
generally do at least half of the productive labor, that
 
they are almost entirely responsible for the continuance
 
I?
 
11
 
of culture, since they pass on its basic tenets to the
 
young and shape their personalities through the kind
, of
 
care they give or withold
.
., and that their interests are
 
central to the growth and continuity of any society.
 
So far as the cultural development program is concerned
.,
 
women occupy the key role; for they -
are the basic transmitters
 
of culture.
 Our program must seek to support and to
 
bring recognition to the feminine role; it must research
 
the needs of women at the folk level and strive to improve
 
their lot.  Above all, if this program succeeds, it will
 
be because it wins the support of women and because they
 
are encouraged to carry on the best things in local culture - 
cooking, crafts, language, tales, poetry, dancing, rituals
 
in the home and in the school.  Many of the best of the
 
field workers will be women and their special assignment
 
should be to find ways to assist the women in improving
 
what they are already doing, which is to provide the
 
basis for all life.  We aim toward a sensitive, culturally
 
sophisticated home extension work, so that modernization
 
can gradually come to the aid of women in their tasks
 
without distorting or shattering the traditional feminine
 
arts.
 
9) LITERATURE -
 It is the general belief of bookish people
 
that literature is all in print.
 The fact is that every
 
form of literature exists in far more profusion in the oral
 
traditions: stories, epics, poems, songs, jokes, sayings,
 
folk-drama and
, ritual are all passed on by word of mouth,
 
filling the air of every human locality with a fifth
 
J
.2
 
dimension of wit and fantasy.
 The field worker must,
 
above all, strive to encourage the continuance of this people's
 
literature -
 by bringing its practicioners in the schools,
 
by supporting the evening circles of tale-telling, by
 
making sure that the great tellers are recorded -
 but
 
above all played back, by bringing the best of the tale
 
tellers and poets on the local radio systems.
 Out of this
 
effort and working with phonetic transcription can emerge
 
a host of local literatures, faithfully written down from
 
the tellers and poets, kept at first in note books as
 
community treasures, then cheaply printed for local
 
circulation, so that the transition from a general oral
 
tradition to an accompanying written tradition may take
 
place with a cross-fertilization between the two media.
 
Becoming literate will then, in school, be writing down
 
and becoming 1 literate in your own tradition along with those
 
of the world outside.
 
10) NON-VERBAL EXPRESSIVE
 
and film make it possible
 
arts, so that they may be
 
TRADITION -
 MUSIC AND DANCE. 
Tape
 
to record and preserve these
 
completely known to future
 
generations.
 I rejoice to hear that there is a vigorous
 
and well-equipped program in the African-Asian Institute
 
for reco
. rding Sudanese music and tales, that there
 
is a fine collection of music in the Radio Archives,
 
and that the film unit is equipping itself so that the dance
 
and
, gesture-life of Sudan may be fully documented and shared
 
as a national treasure.
 In fact the most important use
 
of these documents, after they are carefully stored for
 
posterity in a national archive, is in the stimulation
 
A
O
 
13
 
to have its own archive of its o
wn non-verbal arts;
 
these will be the museums of the future, from which mul-
tiple cult u
ral renewals can ever be springing up.
 
Provincial museums, with catalogues of artists by photo
 
or by other means accessible to the local public, can
 
help by enshrining, celebrating, and playing back the
 
best of the provincial aritsts in local sonnet-lumiere
 
hows.  But by far the best results occur at the village
 
level, provided that the playbacks and projections are
 
eventually made at a good level of quality, so that the
 
people can learn, from this convincing evidence, that
 
their music on the media is just as formidable as any
 
other.  This means that, wherever possible, the field
 
recordist should carry with him battery-operated loud-
speakers so that he can give his informants truly spendid
 
concerts of their own music.
 Short of this, the government
 
mobile projection units should carry with them tapes
 
and when ready, films of local and regional music and
 
dances, so that these presentations will put the local
 
material on a par with what they hear from faraway.
 
The matter of quality control is the crucial element.
 
The highest standards of what is authentic, genuine and
 
classic should be maintained in all these activities
 
especially in these concerts.
 There is a strong tendency
 
in local and
, provincial cultural centers for the locally
 
somewhat educated, somewhat citified to take control
 
and to push their versions of local culture, rather than
 
permitting the reaJ.:thing -to, --be seen or heard.

phoney towny lore has, in many countries, entirely
 
buried or cQrrpted the far finer and more fertile native
 
traditions.  Music, and especially dance, are susceptible
 
of being corrupted and mis-represented.
 I have already
 
observed the effect of this mixing of styles in the fine
 
and lively Folk Dance Band of Sudan.
 Some of their
 
things are fine; some are poor.
 The poor illustrations
 
should be severly rejected.  It must be the business
 
of the folk and cultural worker to push celebrate and
 
present the good and to discourage the mediocre.  His
 
work is to be both critic and diplomat.
 In order to carry,
 
out this function he needs his own experience with and
 
study of the tradition he is working with, but he also
 
can use some training.  Here I can be of some help.
 
The CANTONETRIC training tapes, a copy of which is beings
 
left with Francis
 Deng, sensitizes the listener to the
 
main cultural features of human music, enabling him
 
to judge his own music against that of the rest of Africa
 
and the world, on 37 characteristics.
 These are powerful
 
style factors and if all are kept intact, in the case
 
of any one sti le, it can maintain its integrity.  Know-
ledge of this system, which can be acquired in a week
 
or two of self-instruction from the tapes and handbook,
 
will prepare the field worker for judging the style,
 
of singing and having a
.way of reco niz ng its authen-
ticity.
 I suggested to the head
, of the .
AAI that he have
 
two students train with it during the fall in preparation
 
for my winter visit, and
, then, on my return, we can
. use
 
I
'
D
 
15
 
it to orient the whole of the staff concerned with culture
 
to these problems.
 
The OHOR O
TRIC system performs the same function for
 
dance and movement.  Knowing the student or field worker
 
can point to variations away from an authentic model.
 
Although not so many training flims are available, I
 
can bring some along with me on the projected visit,
 
and, if possible my assistant in dance, and we can to-
gether train a circle of observers and workers with dance
 
some to help develop companies of authentic dancers,
 
others to be expert in their dealings with dance under
 
field conditions, others to film it more eloquently for
 
film and TV.
 
MODELS. Even without these sophisticated techniques
 
of analysis or others, all cultural workers should have
 
extensive exposure to the best examples of non-verbal
 
art in tape, film and live performance, should learn to
 
recognize the salient characteristics of each form, simply
 
by acquaintance, and become sensitive to the aesthetic
 
involved.
 It has been shown that if the very best-and
  
finest models of oral song and dance are always presented
  
and always explained that their validity will be main-
tained or accepted.  Here, for example, the French
 
jazz critics performed the service of bringing the best
 
of jazz to the American public.
 Since your department
 
has all the media at its disposal -
 radio, TV and the press
 
and also the mobile film units -
 and, since the scholars
 
16
 
are your allies -
 the task in Sudan is relatively easy.
 
It amounts to continually presenting,-; m
'
the liveliest
 
and at the same time the best models of the expressive
 
arts -
 the finest pieces of cra±
'tmanshiP with the craftsman
 
at work if possible -
 the best singers and
. orchestras - 
only the greatest and most authentic dance groups,
 
absolutely unchanged, without compromises of costume or
 
ohoreopgraPlly.
 These models win their own victories,
 
if the public is given time to become truly acquainted
 
with them.  Much of the rest of what I have to say con-
cerns the development of a series of models, each of which
 
may have somewhat different audiences, but each of which
 
must be of un compromizing authenticity and
. quality.
 
THE ELITE, THE AUDIENCE OF THE CAPITAL AND ABROAD. 
In
 
developing the enthusiasm of the Roosevelt regime for folk-
lore, at the time of the American folklore revival,
 
we aimed some of our best things at the conversion of
 
the elite.  Here I would suggest several publications,
 
which might immediately be embarked UpOf

many Africans and others would like to have in their

  -
 an edition of the
 
recordings published by Francis Deng for Folkways.
 
There may be more, but these and similar records should
 
be made available and be given a hearing in all the circles
 
of Kartoum and other provincial capitals, in the university,
 
and, of course, over the radio, where they should be
 
seriously reviewed and discussed.  I suggest that one
 
person in the department be given the task of vigorously
 
publicizing this work.
 I would be delighted, of course,
 
to help edit, select, or simply supervise these recordings
 
when I return.
 Or if a selection is made in my absence
 
I can arrange with Folkways to have it mastered and readied
 
for publication, if required.
 
AN ANTHOLOGY OF SUDANESE ORAL LITERATURE. I feel
 
sure that one of our university presses would jump at
 
the chance to publish an anthology of the tales and
, poetry
 
of the peoples of Sudan, brought together to interest
 
the broad reading public in the special charm of this
 
material.
 I should imagine that there must be enough
 
representative material already collected to make such
 
a preliminary volume possible, if one drew upon both new
 
and old studies.  I feel that .
AAI or D of C should immediately
 
launch this project, so that the elites of this country
 
and abroad can come to appreciate the potential of this
 
multi-civilization we are dreaming about.  Perhaps
 
an Arabic edition would be even more desirable than one
 
in English.

portraits of other parts of the country, bits of dialogue,
 
sounds, music, hymns, arranged area by area and group

components of Sudan would be brought together in brief
 
form, with the magic touch of good sound editing.

THE POPULAR MEDIA. RADIO. 
Please understand that
 
I am unacquainted with the programming styles and content
 
of Sudanese radio.  My suggestions therefore do not
 
reflect on what is or has been done, but only encompass
 
some program ideas which will provide support for the
 
diversity of Sudanses culture.  If such training has not
 
been available, I would suggest that someone from BBC features
 
be brought in to help in this development.  Moreover,
 
I would recommend that writers and producers,
 
with a background in or passionate concern for folklore
 
be brought in to the department of culture, to help
 
prepare these programs for radio broadcast.  Again
 
the accent should be on the very highest level of authen-
ticity, -accuracy and quc1ity.
 
HELLO SUDAN -
 a radio program of five minute spots,
 
each one to be repeated several times a day or a week,
 
until the "message" has been absorbed -
 a cultural commercial
 
in sum -
 each one dealing with a different tribe, locality
 
neighborhood, or tradition -
 giving a brief sketch of the
 
facts about it in breezy, witty style.  At the beginning
 
there is an exchange of greetings in the language or
 
dialect and the listener thus can learn a word or two
 
of the native dialect, how to say hello, how to ask for
 
food and shelter and so on.
 Then he goes to a party,
 
a feast, a festivity and hears some of the music of the
 
place.
 Then there is a passage of serious talk in which
 
he learns about the history, ethnic origin, economic
 
problems and special peculiarities of the group - there
 
20
 
is a farewell song, in which he is encouraged to join.  He
 
learns to say goodbye in the idiom, and is told goodbye.
 
These carefully prepared spots can be conserved and made
 
into an educational package for use in primary schools
 
as discussed in the note on Sudanese Roots. With new
 
spoken coninuity they then can be broadcast in various
 
other languages.
 The aim is to inform all Sudan about
 
Sudan, putting the facts about the whole nation on the
 
air, culturally speaking.
 
TALES OF THE NILE. Arabic speakers from a wide var-
iety of Sudanese groups can be found in Kartoum.
 These
 
people should be brought together fot a series of half
 
hour programs of folk tales, jokes, legends, tall stories
 
and so on, coming from their own locailties, but translated
 
into Arabic.  The narrator of this program might be a
 
real jokesmith who can incite the participants into regular
 
contests of wit.
 
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SONG IN THE WORLD 
-
 a half-hour semi-
dramatic series, concerning the adventures of a young
 
composer in search of the most beautiful song the the world
 
to make as a theme in his new composition.  He becomes
 
dissatisfied with the music of the capital and journeys
 
through the country from place to place, looking for
 
the tune of his dreams.  Everywhere he asks people to sing)
 
everywhere he looks for the great musicians; he tells
 
us what he finds, describes his adventures, his encounters
 
with strange people and, at times, with beautiful girls.
 
Above all, he plays us the music he records along the way,
 
beauties.  He is almost ready to choose a song, in every
 
program, but then, in the midst of his work, he hears
 
about another song, another singer down the road, and
 
off he goes toward his next adventure -
 which the listener
 
will hear about next week .
.. Here is a slot in which radio
 
Sudan can use all the best of its exotic tape recordings,
 
the material in the archive, plus lots of solid ethno-
graphic information in making a romantic tale that should
 
attract a good audience.
 The fictional hero of this
 
program might become, with his singing and his tam'our-
.playing,
 
a national pop-character.
 
IF ANTER LIVED AGAIN -
 modeled
. on The  \
igitive -
 this pro-
gram has a hero who is always on the r
i m, always in trouble,
 
although he is a person of the best intentions and the
 
finest motives.
 This young
. man is an admirer of the poet
 
.
Antar, whom he is fond of quoting, and believes that life
 
in our times can be full of adventure; indeed for him
 
it always is.  He is always fighting injustice, rescuing
 
maidens in distress, poking his nose in where it should
 
not go, befriending the wrong people, flirting with the
 
wrong women, always in hot water, and often on the
 
run from his enemies.  However, because of his charm,
 
his cleverness, his laughter, his ability to talk people
 
round, to fight and then to move quickly away from danger,
 
he manages to escape and to end up with half the world in
 
love with him and the other half laughing at his escapades..
 
This modern .
Antar is interested in everything; he hunts
 
with the hunters, herds with the herders, mines with
 
the m1ners, robs with the robbers, tries out the whole
 
22
 
of life.
 Through him the listener wanders over the whole
 
vast landscape of Sudan, becoming a part of its most
 
exciting secrets, always drawn on by the romance he finds
 
everywhere.  He comes to symbolize the romantic spirit
 
of the land and its people.
 Through his adventures
 
Sudan comes to know itself... THE FORMULA COULD, OF COURSE
 
BE APPLIED TO A YOUNG ENGINEER OR A YOUNG EDUCATOR...
 
BUT I PEEL THE ROMANTIC CHARACTER WOULD IN THE END
 
REACH MORE PEOPLE AND DO MORE GOOD.
 
THE RIVER OF SONG
- 
-
 begining with a theme symbolizing
 
the eternal Nile this serious musical half-hour looks
 
for the roots of the culture of Sudan in its varied
 
music -
 recorded North, South, East or West.  Here the
 
musical instruments are played and
. discussed.  V ried
 
rhythms are analyzed, melodies are compared, traditions
 
are examined, and families of style are put together.
 
The far-flung connexions of Sudanese music can he presented
 
along with many many facts of Sudanese history, in a
 
tone that is serious, informative, but basically popular,
 
so as to appeal to the man in the street.
 The same programs,
 
with translated script might well be good for international
 
consumption.

CARTOUM IS SUDAN

 a variety hour or half hour that would

including people from the far-flung corners of the country.
 
It would encourage songs and jokes and bits of dialogue
 
in various languages, including those of the non-African

course.  Its aim would be to show how interesting and
 
exciting and talent-filled a place Kàrtouin actually is,
 
if all its people are brought to the mike.
 
THE SOUND OF AFRICA. 
The music of Africa is probably
 
better recorded than that of any other part of the world.
 
Literally  hundreds of field recordings are available
 
from every area, from every tradition, and from this
 
wealth this program would be drawn, stressing the message
 
of the strong ties and yet the distinctive differences
 
between the music of the continent and the music of
 
Sudan.
 
TELEVISION PROGRAMS. Not so much time and space is allo-
cated to TV in this report, because TV is not yet the main-
stay in Sudan that it may yet become.  As a student of
 
the medium and what it has done to culture in my own and
 
other countries, I have this strong suggestion to make.
 
Do not permit the television establishment to become self-
contained and isolated, as it tends to become everywhere.
 
The workers and directors in TV have such a difficult
 
and fascinating task that they tend to become self-
absorbed and self-serving, unable to really be interested
 
in what other people have to say  about them, gradually
 
becoming a power-elite, occupied with selling their own
 
ideas and with their own approach to education, which
 
seldom reflects the needs or the views of t
1e country
 
they serve.
 Just as in the case of the American army,
 
citizen control needs to be maintained over TV, so that
 
this process doesn't swallow it up and then absorb the
 
non-professionals of the highest intellectual and creative
 
capacity and good sense in
 dominant policy positions,
 
so that your system can grow in a healthy fashion.
 
Another general princip & is to present frequently all
 
the kinds of people, all the kinds of dress, costumes,
 
mannerisms, dialects, styles of address that are normal
 
to the various cultures and social strata in the country.
 
Otherwise the medium becomes the avenue of the dress,
 
posture, gestures, behaviors, mannerisms of only one culture
 
and ono class.  When this hap en ,a1l the other cj
zens
 
begin to feel self-conscious about who they are and why
 
.

In the cross-cultural study of body language, we have
 
learned that every culture has its own non-verbal communica-
tion  system as rich and as interesting and as valuable
 
in potential as every other one.
 These systems are trans-
mitted by film and TV; in order to keep the rich mix
 
of  r
stems that makes Sudan a fascinating place to live
 
and offers it so many ways of handling problems and so
 
many avenues of growth, it is essential that from the
 
beginning a
ll are respectfully and frequently allowed
 
on the tu1ie.
 This is communication democracy in action.
 
In order to give these principles some programmatic
 
contexts, I am suggesting the following ideas for TV
 
seri2s, any one of which would make a contribution to
 
the support of Sudanese culture.
 
SUDANESE ADVENTURE.  A series of half-hour documentaries
 
on the riskiest occupations and sports of the Sudanese
 
people, stressing the co u
rage, the hardihood of the
 
of var
 eT 4 'r •
 g r n '1r s  as the
 i
ce life-
endangering problems or participate in contests or in
 
personal combat.  Here the viewer watches hunting, diving,
 
sailing, nomadism, mountain climbing, fights against
 
flood and drought, sports, dueling -
 a series of real-
life adventure stories.
 This series could be shot
 
by a professional company in six months time, and could
 
be sold abroad.
 It certainly should interest the hor
l!t
.
 
audience and increase the attachment to the national image,
 
at the same time as it celebrated the exploits of the whole
 
range of Sudanese cultures.
 I
'd like to participate in
 
planning and carrying out this one.
 
WEDDINGS. 
Some of the best and most successful docu-
mentaries of Eastern Europe are the films taken at the
 
folk wedding ceremonies in that region.
 I feel sure that
 
Sudanese weddings are even more varied and fascinating.
 
Documentation of this moment in the life-cycle across
 
the band width of human culture would present Sudanse
 
society at its most appealing, most romantic and happiest
 
moments.  The footage going into these films would make
 
an .
archive of custom of endless value to the folklorist
 
and the historian of custom.  Each program would attempt
 
to personalize the event by showing to the viewer through
 
the eyes of one of its participants -
 the mother of the
 
bride, the groom, the father-in-law, the best-man, and so
 
on, so that listener would be "there" as he watched.
 
SUDAN IS FESTIVAL. 
There must be many thousands of
 
colorful and brilliant people's festivals in Sudan - 
celebrating harvest, the return of the herd, the birth
 
of
 the maturation of yoirng men, as well as
 
26
 
others.  And by choosing the best of these we can cer-
tainly create a series of programs that will fascinate
 
TV viewers and cinema audiences, at the same time as
 
they get to know their country better.  Again the approach
 
should  be one of being in the festival, seeing it from
 
the inside, learning about it from one of the partici-
pants, as well as being told about its importance by the
 
guide and narrator of the program.
 
THE WAY WE DO IT. Here the craftsmen, the folk musicians,
 
the cultivaotrs, the cooks the artisans, the engineers,
 
the teachers show their countrymen how they do their jobs,
 
how they make what they make, how they create what they
 
create.  These are individual portraits  of the treasures
 
of Sudanese hand-skills and ingenuity, where the single
 
craftsman or creator, along with his intimate group,
 
show how he em
'iches life in his own place.
 
THE WAYS 0
1? TE
E WOI
-ILD. 
This should be a series util-
izing the best of world documentaries, showing the life-
.styles  of all the world's peoples.
 There is an almost
 
endless treasure of such films, particularly rich in Af-
rican subjects, which could be brought to this TV audience.
 
THE MOBILE PROJECTION UNITS
 
Such Sudanese documentary films as those just describe(
.
 
are essential cinema fare for the rural audiences re:
 
by the mobile vans. These people must see themselves
 
and their o n kinds of life-styles portrayed we l
l and
 
nobly in the cnema redi' m so that they won't
 be  oo
 
'2
 
dazzled by the films depicting non-Sudanese life.
 
Tape  shows of Sudanese native music, especially of
 
the region should accompany these programs.
 This
 
naive, truth-oriented audience should be given films of
 
the greatest educational importance -
 the great docu-
mentary films about Africa and the Middle East
 so that
 
they can see themselves as part of their region,
 They should
 
be given ethnographic films from all over the world as
 
well, so that they will develop a world perspective,
 
and will be made aware that their lives are as rich
 
and exciting as those of the'peoples of other lands.
 
It would be ideal if folklorists and cultural workers
 
could prepare these programs and the continuity that
 
introduced them, and if they could also make tours w--
!--,
I
i
 
trucks to find out how the people were receiving and
 
understanding these filmed messages from faraway.
 This
 
is an ideal situation for an important study of human
 
communication.
 
PLANNING ETHNOGRAPHIC FILMING
  
FEEDBACK
 
In my mind the most important use of ethnographic
 
film is in the community and among the people who are its
 
subjects, so that they can see themselves in this larger-
than-life medium and grow from this experience.
 These
 
days many of the most advanced documentarists in America
 
are making films for communities with the collaboration
 
of the people in the communities.  Here film serves
 
its main purpose -
 cultural feedback; the culture in every
 
case being the culture f
ilmed.
 
FOOTAGE
 
Straight-forward realistic long sequences serve these purposes
 
best.
 The detailed depiction of exactly what transpired during
 
an event, how an operation was carried out, the whole of an inter-
action -
 this kind of footage is in the end the most useful - 
both to the scientist who wants to study and restudy what
 
happened and how things work -
 and to the people of the culture
 
themselves.
 I strongly recommend that the Department of Culture
 
in collaboration with TV and the Film Unit and the University
 
of Kartoum set up a footage archive, where the complete footage
 
of all documentaries of interest shot in Sudan is kept and care-
fully catalogued.
 This archive will prove a priceless national
 
treasure in years to come.  Meantime, it will be a source of cinema
 
programs which the folk audiences of the country will greatly
 
benefit from.  Also it can become the material for serious study
 
of the structures of Sudanese types of non-verbal communication.
 
M
tJLTI-PURPO SED FIL11NG
 
Whenever a sizeable ethnographic film is done -
 at least three
 
kinds of audiences and three kinds of cinema outcomes can be
 
planned for. 1) The local audience of the people filmed which will
 
enjoy and benefit from seeing the total footage shot, 2
) the
 
scientific audience that wishes to study non-verbal communication
 
and human interaction, 3
) the general audience.
 
this third catagory actually includes two films
 
version for home consumption in the province or
 
origin and
, a shorter, quicker-paced version for
 
Perhaps
 
-
 a very long
 
the
 
country of
 
the international
 
audience, if there is one.
 Too often, the individi 1 cinema
 
maker sacrifices these possibilities in order to make the fourth
 
29
 
type -
 the hit film which will bring him fame and fortune.  How-
ever, in planning to use cinema for general cultural ends, these
 
other kinds of film outcomes and other audience interests may
 
be kept in mind.
 
T
 ETHNOGRAPHIC FILM
 
We should plan a series of five or six big ethnographic flims - 
dealing with the main, and outstanding types of culture found
 
in Sudan.
 Certainly one on Dinka life where Francis Deng will
 
act as a collaborator, one of the Nuba mountain world, one of the
 
Beja, one of the Nubians, one of the Fur, one of the Zand,  or
 
other equatorial tribes.
 I am sure if the Sudanese government
 
lends their support to such a project, that good film-makers
 
could be found and that the project could be well-financed.
 
The ideal way to work is for an ethnographic film maker to spend
 
an extended period with a people, or else for an experienced
 
ethnographic cameraman to work for a time with an anthropologist
 
who knows a locality and its interests thoroughly.
 
I suggest two steps.  Let us invite the real stars of ethnogra-
phic filming from a)Australia b)Japan  )France d)C
-ermany e
)the
 
US f)Holland g)Switzerland -
 each one to make a film, with a
 
Sudanese trainee anthropologist as assistant and collaborator.
 
At the end of their work on these films -
 which should continue
 
right through the editing -
 the Sudanese will know every aspect
 
of the business from start to finish.  Moreover, the six or seven
 
young men will pool all the knowledge in the field, and Sudan will
 
be self-sufficiet so far as field ethnographic film-making is
 
Concerned.  Part of the contract with each film-maker brought
 
in will be to train his Sudanese team.

I
:
 
An equally important step is to bring in an adiveor from the
 
film production side
 make certain that the whole of your produc-
tion chain -
 developing, printing, editing, mixing,etc. is exactly
 
what it should be.  My amateur's impression is that it is almost
 
all there, but that two or three components are not as they should
 
be  and that there are certain impro ve me nt s  to be made.
 One or
 
two obvious things...
 
1) Humidity Ccn roit. A U  Um and tape must be kept at
 
optimum levels of humidity and temperature . Drying out i  a
 
big problem.
 The air conditioners are at work but no humidifying
 
systems that I saw -
 and at least in the tape archives there were
 
no meters on the wall (
these are cheap items).
 
2
) Sound. I heard poor quality in the film unit material.
 
This is somet ing easy to remedy, but it needs the attention of
 
an expert.  By the way, many Sudanese seem to work too'
. close
 
to the mike and this can be a source of distortion.
 
3
) Print Quality. Many Sudanese films I sar seemed too
 
washed out or light -
 as if the originals had been over-exposed
 
or the printing had not been correctly done.
 This blight should
 
be looked into.
 
4
) Projection Damage. 
Ala. Sudanese pictures I saw had
 
been badly scratched1 scarred,and so on in projection.
 The cadre
 
of projectionists  must be taught and disciplined, because this
 
means a huge loss of money in damaged prints.

PRESERVATION 
By preservation I mean permanent storage of folklore on film,
 
tape, or paper in various kinds of archives.  All originals should
 
be kept in archives completely closed to all outsiders and wider
 
optimum conditions of humidity, temperature and
, cleanliness.
 
It is unnecessary, perhpas, to combine all the collections - 
provided that all conform to the same rules of storage and
 
catalOguing.
 There should be a central control point, probably
 
located in the Department of Culture, where a central catalogue
 
is maintained
..
 This unit should be commissioned to review all
 
current film, tape and souid programs occuring on the networks
 
and should keep copies of those judged to be of historic or eth-
nographic interest.  A national system of audio-visual archiving
 
can accumulate a treasure of inclaculable value for the growing
 
nation.
 
Audio-visual libraries where copies of films of sound -
 and
 
soon video-tapes or discs of sound -
 can immediately be set up
 
in provincial and even local cultural centers.
 The visits of
 
outsiders from Kartoum or elsewhere to record or film local ac-
tivities is a very impressive thing to the people of a locality;
 
1.
 
able to receive or at least to have access to copies of these
 
.
tapes.  Little local archives can be set up nowadays with a
 
$60 cassette machine as their center; and the people can begin
 
to gather and study their own
, culture.  Meantime good sound
 
reproduction facilities will, of course, be part of the on-coming
 
cultural centers; and here visitors from the country will find
 
the tapes recorded by the folklorists and other professionals.
 
The catalogues of these collections should be designed so that
 
the folk, themselves, can use them.  In
. the Upper Volta, for instance,
 
songs are filed by singer, with a photograph of each prominent
 
singer heading h  section in the tape catalogue.
 
These sound libraries should contain more than songs and music.
 
They should also store folk-tales, rituals, life-histories, con-
versations and the sounds of daily life.  Moreover, they ought
 
to be completely  transcribed and annotated, where possible,
 
by the recorders and performers themselves.  Developed in this
 
way, the materials in an audio-visual library can provide a
 
basis for stabilizing and formalizing a culture and giving it
 
maturity.  It will enable a people to skip the slow, somewhat
 
old-fashioned methods of print, books, museums of objects -
 and
 
substitute, to a considerable extent, collections of living
 
human communication, interaction and expressive behavior -
 all
 
potential for perpetuating the permanent and valuable structure
 
of a culture.
 Thus these ARCHIVES OF THE QU.LCK T
KEDIA -  THESE
 
AUDIO-VISUAL MUSEUMS -
 can become the basis for the new civiliz-
tion -
 where the images of the whole past, of all the people can
 
be capt u
red and the swift developments of all new cultural currents
 
can be displayed and enjoyed and, through the newly developing
 
science and art of communication, be evaluated and under tood.
 
5)
 
Modern man now swims in a torrent of communication, coming at
 
him from all directions via many media.
 In the future, this almost
 
uncontrollable river of sound and vision will wash into the lives
 
of every Sudanese.  I believe that, in order to maintain balance,
 
all people everywhere need to be given some sophisticated under-
standing of the content of the media, so that they can reject
 
poor and turn to good sounds and images.  Human beings have
 
built in audio-visual evaluating systems -
 but the damage that
 
records and
. TV and radio have inflicted on the souls of Americans
 
and Europeans shows that we all need to be better prepared for
 
this onslaught of sound and image.  Everyone should have training
 
in rudimentary linguistics -
 phonetics, at least.
 Such training
 
will make every schoolchild literate, enabling him or her to write
 
down his own heritage of poetry and prose and become sensitive
 
to it.  Training in CANTOT'LETRICS, which can be taught from tape
 
or even over the radio, will make all listeners into musical
 
sophisticates, able to understand the basis of their own musical
 
preferences and thus defend the b
.asis.of.,their own musical
 
preferences and thus defend the best of what they really like.
 
RESEARCH 
Here, of course, much good work has been done in the past and
 
is' currently going on.
 I was very impressed by the solid beginnings
 
in the folklore section of the .
AAI, for example.  One strong rec-
ommendation is that all folklore research be centered there or
 
directed from that group, at least, for the moment.  Nothing is
 
worse or can have worse effect than badly done folklore work.
 
When and if I return next winter, I should like to have a chance
 
to orient the teaching staff of the Institute as well as that of
 
the Department of Culture and those who are to be involved in
 
filming and recording and presenting Sud
,anses folklore, and
, the
 
students and workers in the AAI and the D of C
. The orientation
 
coming from Cantometrics and Choreometrics, as well as the practi-
cal knowledge I have of folklore revivals, will be useful to all
 
these people.
 Some of the students, of course, can do more intensive
 
training in the analytic techniques than others, and will be pre-
pared to analyze, classify, and interpret some aspects of Sudanese
 
living tradition.
 
I have wandered a bit from what I wished to say.
 Of absolutely
 
paramount importance is the completion and enrichment of ethno-
graphic surveys of Sudan, begun well by the British, and superbly
 
exemplified in Deng's book on the Dinka.  We ought, in the long
 
run, to aim for a series of monographs of that high calibre about
 
every culture in this country.  Meantime, the anthropology depart-
ment at Kartoum University should be urged and supported in the
 
work of completing its present surveys of the North and East.
 
I gather there are other efforts afoot, such as the study of the
 
excellent young scholar, Asha Mustafa; these should all be linked up.
 
The big job of Sudanese ethnography could certainly be superbly
 
done within a decade if the scores of talented young graduate students
 
in America, for example, who are looking for thesis subjects, were
 
enlisted in this work.  This would cost the Sudanese government
 
nothing at all, unless it wished to establish a system of colla-
boration and training for its young MA anthroplogy candidates
 
to participate in this work.
 These st udies should be carried
 
out within the limits of some standardized plan so that their re-
sults would be comparable.
 If ten or fifteen
 ll-distributed
 
e
'thnographies were done according to a standard plan, and paralleled
 
by Cantometric, linguistic and folklore studies, the baselines of
 
Sudanese culture and its poe -bntials for growth would be visible
 
and useable.  But standardization is essential, if we plan to bring
 
computer study of the results to bear on the problems.
 
The development of the tape machine makes it possible toi cord
 
and study the whole audible tradition.
 Oral histories enlist
 
the participation of the people, themselves, in the preservation
 
of t
I
r cultures.
 Soon cheap video-recording will double this
 
potential,
 Then cultural studies will probably become a general
 
human preoccupation, as a t'ij
.e science of culture, based on
 
detailed studies of permanent audible and visual evidence, will
 
be created by specialists.  Meantime, however, the burning question
 
in the Sudan is the protection of the well-springs of culture,
 
itself, for these can rapidly dry up in the hot winds of modern-
ization.  Modernization, for the cultural point of view, simply
 
consists in pressuring people to forget their own traditions and
 
accept those f
ragments o
f a standardized mainstream culture
 
which they are given the chance to acquire.
 
CONXTJNITY WORX -
 CULTURAL CARETAKING
 
This whole report has dealt with various ways in which a bene-
ficent central government can foster the continuance of local cultures.
 
All these however, are subordinate to work at the community level.
 
In the best of all worlds there should be an anthropologist and/or
 
a skilled folklorist living in every community, who is concerned
 
about the maintananCe o
f the quality Of life -
 that is, the con-
tinuance of the best of the past and its most harmonious and
 
rewarding development and growth.
 Short of this, a small cadre
 
of concerned and well-trained folklorists and anthropologists
 
should be permanently established in the field to look after the
 
36
 
Part of what these appled culturologists will do will, of course,
 
be research,but the major activity will be supportive activity - 
cultural diplomacy.
 They must work at the face of the community,
 
looking after the arts, the artists, the spirit of t
]e culture.
 
Their concern must be for the genuine, for the perpetuation of
 
high standards.  They will find new avenues for the artists and
 
singers, displaced by schools and mass communication.
 They will
 
find ways for the traditional arts to be taught in the schools,
 
without disturbing the flow of general training.
 They will super-
vise the festivals.
 They will help the craftsmen to protect
 
themselves from rip off and
, to maintain ancient high standards
 
of quality.
 -
.
 They
 
will fight for full and high quality coverage of local culture
 
by the media.  They will encourage the women to continue the
 
transmission of domestic lore, and will help them gain recognition.
 
They will be the caretakers of the traditional arts during this
 
period of rapid change.
 They will act as advocates of the people
 
as they come under pressure, interpreting their country ways to
 
sometimes hasty urbanites.  They will actively participate in
 
the development of new communities, making sure that their cultural
 
life is enriched from traditiaal sources and that the arts and
 
graces of the past in housing, cooking, assembling and entertain-
ing bring their riches and their joys into these modern habitats.
 
And this is only the barest outline of their responsibilities.
 
Their job requires, first of all, deep commitment to people and
 
to folklore and popular tradition.
 Second, it requires keen
 
perception of the genuine and the authentic that comes from the
 
best training in anthropology and folklore.  Here what I have to
 
o
ffer with the CANTO
TRIC and
. CHOREO
TRIC training methods can

p eren  an    li±
'y wha
'
 he iright young graduate student
 
or the writer or folklore smatuer already has —
 a sensitization, 
to some of the structures of non-verbal communication, at the
 
expressive level.  But most of all it demands experience and hard
 
work.
 
Here I recommend that Sayyid put together
, a team of the best
 
available people in AAI and D of C along with other who wanted
 
to do this work, but have since gone on to other posts.
 The
 
aim should be a cadre of ten and hopefully at I
sast twenty people,
 
who should be set to work, full-time, in studying the current
 
situation of the sub-cultures in Kartoum, finding the artists,
 
aiming perhaps to produce an all-Sudanese folk festival, composed
 
of people who live here.
 In the process of do±g this practical
 
job, this team will acquire some of the practical experience
 
they will need for the field.  They might then go on to put to-
gether some sort of sizeable cultural event in some other part
 
of
 i
dan.  In each case the results of their studies, of their
 
research, will be of immediate and visible benefit to the human
 
communities involved.  After this experience each of these applied
  
culturologists should be put in afieldstation to survey an area
 
and to plan for its cultural future, in the light of the recommen-
dations made in this plan and in other such planning.
 One essential
 
thing, of course, is to catalogue the kinds of expressive material
 
and events of each terrain and to locate and to get to know the
 
principal performers and their standards.  At the end of the first
 
six months of work, the gro p can come back together for an ex-
tended period of discussion, replanning and pooling ideas.
 
Thus, I believe, a major and permanently beneficial
 
tet forward will have been made for culture, not to speak
 
of anthropology and folklore.
 It is essential that anth-
ropologists and folklorists, especially in a developing
 
country like Sudan, should leave their libraries and their
 
studios and offices, and move their activities out into
 
the field, in order to apply their skills and their per-
ceptions in helping communities and their artists develop
 
in a healthy and creative fashion.

have a very dull lot, which, it seems to me, is w
 
u've got. I think that the Festival is a discretio

i American life that have brought color, excitement, anL
 
Jtural contribution to this country. We should be

  really miniscule

I myself would lean strong
 
award having,  say, the Lituanians because of the unusual
 
aracter of their folk tradition. I don't see how you could
 
ave out the Dutch, because of the fundamental nature of
 
i

These countries are so small that their head-count would

It the moment, not having the group of Albanian musicians who
 
ave suddenly turned up in New York would be like not having
 
The most exciting ethnic group music that has ever arrived

They are the very latest of our batches of immigrants,
 
leeing from the latest of the social repressive situations;
 
and they  can represent that.

Dear Timothy
 
Bess sent me your l
ong memorandum on reshaping the
 
s
ociety.  I
t i
s a coherent and sensible plan that will
 
beneifit academic  folklorists and other professing to be
 
folklorists ,
 but I
. found i
t disappointing. In only one
 
place does i
t mention what must be the principal goal o
f our
 
efforts--"to increase the respect for folklore and the
 
folk'--  tHE REST DEALS WITH HOW FTHE PROFESSIONALS I

HAS BEEN CONDEMNED AS POPULARIZATION ,
 AND UNTIL RECENTLY
 
I
TS PRACTTITIONERS HAVE BEEN BEYOND THE PALE SO FAR
, AS
 
AADEMIC FOLKLORE WAS CONCERNED.

The Colonial Williamsburg Motion Picture

OF
 WI L L I A M S B U R G
  
Content Guide to Complete and Condensed Version 
Since the purpose of this motion picture is to give an interpretation
  
of the 18th century musical l
ife of the Colony of Virginia, enough of each selec-
tion is presented to identify it and to respond to it.  A f
orthcoming guide to
 
the motion picture will further identify sources for various selections.
 
Also, this l
isting may assist those who need to choose the version most
 
suitable to their needs.  Though there is a difference in motion picture editing
 
style between the versions, f
rom a content standpoint, the basic differences are
 
two:
 f
irst, the complete version has four more musical numbers, and f
ive others
 
are presented more completely.  Second, the condensed version is twelve minutes
 
shorter.  This permits it to be used in situations where this time-difference is
 
important, and in the conventional television time period.
