j. H. RYAN' S 
Great Personation of the " Irish Guide." 
TRATELLERs to the " Green Isle" never appear to tire of rehearsing 
the peculiarities, good humor, and ready wit of the " Jarveys " that drive 
the little jaunting-ears about Dublin and its vicinage. 
These fellows rat-
tle over the stones, their tongues wagging all the while; their uncontrol-
lable spirits and rollicking humbr making the roughest roads smooth. 
Many Irish comedians have essayed to represent this character; but 
rarely with success. They have too often mistaken " cheek " for wit, and 
vulgarity for humor. But no such faults are apparent in M R. RYAN'S 
delineation of the" Irish Guide." He has studied the character from the 
life, and he gives us a 
delicious picture of the drolleries of the originaL 
It is certain that the best dramatic critics vie with each other in eulogiz-
ing M R. RYAN'S capital rendering of the amusing " Jarvey," a 
character 
as essentially Irish as the Shamrock itself. 
Every person that delights in 
a 
perfect character-painting of that " mad wag," the driver of the jaunt-
ing- car, should see Ma. RYAN play the part. 
It is reality itself, and it 
requires no great exercise of imagination, while listening to his inimita-
ble " soothering " brogue, to fancy one's self on the banks of the Liffey or 
driving through the unbrageous avenues of the incomparable" Phaynix." 
But while this gentleman is the very embodiment of " rale" fun and 
sparkling wit, he never sullies his lips by profanity or vulgarity to raise 
a 
laugh from the thoughtless or win the applause of the ignorant. 
It 
may here be appropriately mentioned that this present edition of his songs 
is in every way superior to all previous issues. 
The songs are more numer-
ous, are more correctly printed, and many of Mn. RYAN'S original poems 
and songs are given that have never previously appeared in print. 
Here, 
too, we should mention that Mn. RYAN'S literary abilities as a 
poet are 
not a 
bit less than his great merit as a performer. 
Permeated with a 
love of his native country, every throb of his heart is true to the beauti-
ful Isle of the Sea. We trust that the public appreciation and admiration 
of this young poet-actor's talents will be as universal as his deserts are 
great.

NOTICES OF THE PRESS Off MR. 
J. 
H. 
RYAN 
"SHANDY McGrinr."—Mr. J. II. 
RYAN as Shandy, and also as the old 
woman, is almost unrivalled. 
His witticisms are splendid, and his jokes 
are such as to keep his audience lapsing from one fit of hysterics to an-
other.—.New York Sunday Mercury, Jan. 25, 1874. 
THE Inuit COMEDIAN, M R, J. 
II. 
RYAN.—It 
is with great pleasure we 
hear of our young and talented friend ItYsses success in his specialty—the 
Irish Drama. He has revolutionized the burlesque, hitherto fashionable 
and popular with the thoughtless, who only cared that their risibilities 
were pandered to, while it has long and cruelly pained sensible and reflec-
tive men; but in his style they have more fun exhibited, more genius il-
lustrated, and more patriotism consecrated, than judicious lovers of" The 
Island of Sorrow" thought it possible to combine in exhibitions of the de-
scription to which Mr. RYAN is attached. He has just published the third 
series of his stage songs—many of them his own corn position—a 
perusal 
of which, together with his previous efforts, will illustrate our remarks 
above more tully than anything short of seeing or hearing himself on the 
stage. 
Mr. SEAVY must be congratulated on having secured for his " Hi-
bernia's Gems" the services of such a 
trio of stars ( we might justly say, 
such rams of Hibernia) as the handsom ,., versatile, and gifted :Miss NEI, 
L/R VINCENT, the eloquent lecturer and inimitable pianist, Mr. M . 
J. 
O'M ArioN Y, 
and the incomparable song, dance, and generally humorous 
artist, Mr. J. H. EvAs,—.11-ew York News. 
J. 
U. 
RYAN is an exception to the general rule of Irish comedians, who 
think the mora ridicule they adopt the better they are received ; but this 
gentleman, in placing himself above the level of such performers, has won 
for himself the love and esteem of our Irish citiz.ins. — Albany Argus. 
J. H. 
RYAN'S original character of Shandy McGuire is one of true patri-
otic cast, and is highly instructive ; morality is conspicuous throughout, 
and it is really amusing, Which takes an actor of ability to do it justice. 
Mr. RYAN'S conception of this role is unrivalted. — Hackensack Herald. 
Mr. RYAN is a 
comedian of rare ability; a 
native of Dublin ciit

lie is 
quite young, has a 
good voice and a 
good appearance . H e i

J. 
II. 
RYAN has gained a 
good deal of importance as an Irish comedian, 
and renders his songs with that amount of patriotic sentiment and pa-
thos which only an Irish exile ( as he is) and worthy son of old Ireland can 
feel. —Sunday Citizen, New York. 
It has been our fortune to witness many representations of our race on 
the stage by various actors, but with none were we more pleased than with 
Mr. J. H. RYAN. It has been well said, " His witticisms are splendid 
and his jokes are such as keep his audience continually lapsing from one 
fit of hysterics into another." His attire is in keeping with his character— 
neat and tidy ; assuming the character of Shandy McGuire, lie dresses as 
to impersonate a 
comfortable farmer's son, and is perfectly free from vul-
garity. 
His episode, entitled " Shandy McGuire." is highly moral and in-
structive, and possesses much of that wondrous wit which is so conspicu-
ous in the general character of the Irish race. 
His Irishism is also promi-
nent ih his every movement. He is a 
good Irishman, and more, an Irish 
exile, We wish ham every success in his dramatic career. —.1fusicai

EILEEN ASTHORE. 
Wtitten and sung by J. 
H. 
RYAN with great effect in his beautiful IPA 
iSketch entitled " Barners Return." 
AIR.--" Because I 
was poor." 
-W EIL'S I 
left poor old Ireland, 
The new world to roam, 
I 
bid good bye to Eileen, 
And left me old home; 
When the friends of my childhood 
Took me by the hand 
And bid me good luck 
In that far-distant land, 
When I 
landed in New York, 
Though friends I 
had none, 
I 
sought hard for labor 
Till my day's toil begun, 
And the money I 
earned 
I 
sated up in store 
To return to old Ireland, 
And my Eileen Astliore. 
Sure the letter she sent me 
When far o'er the sea, 
To my heart was. more welcome 
Than gold e'er could be. 
_Ah, come back to me, Barney, 
Were the last words I 
read, 
For I 
now am so lonely 
Since mother is dead, 
And that little mud cabin 
That stands on the hill, 
sure I 
hope that my Eileen 
Is living there still, 
For with me she'll come 
To Columbia's bright shore, 
Where happy I'll live 
With my Eileen Asthore. 
• TI T GREEN FLAG OF IRELAND. 
Written by W ILLIAM M . 
COLLINS expressly for and dedicated to .
3. H. 
RyAN, and sung by him with great success. 
Now, Irishmen, draw near 
To the few lines I 
have here, 
And then you will be satisfied to say, 
Come join, both heart and hand, 
In that gallant Fenian band 
For the glorious turnout on Patrick's day. 
Let Irishmen be seen 
To stand up by the green, 
As. they always did in former days of yore; 
May the American flag be seen 
With the little shamrock green, 
And freedoin to old Ireland evermore. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for Erin's isle, 
And may Heaven on her smile, 
As it always did in former days of yore; 
May the American flag be seen 
With the standard flag of green, 
And freedom to old Ireland evermore. 
On the plains of Vinegar Hill, 
Where the foemen got their fill, 
The Irish from the field 
They made them fly.

'LEIB GREEN FLAG OF IRELAND.—Concluded. 
Faggaballagh they did cry, 
We will conquer or we'll die, 
Was the word was heard 
From every Irishman; 
Then let the flag of green 
On the battle-field be seen, 
And death to every traitor it will show; 
May the American flag be seen 
With the standard flag of green, 
And freedom to old Ireland evermore. 
Then hurrah, etc. 
Dan O'Connell, old Ireland's friend, 
Sure he struggled to defend 
Agqinst the tyrant traitor long ago; 
But Robert Emmet he did say. 
Before he passed away, 
Give freedom to old Ireland evermore; 
Then let the flag at last 
Be nailed up to the mast, 
And peace and happiness attend our shore; 
May the American flag be seen 
With the standard flag of green, 
And freedom to old Ireland evermore. 
Then hurrah, etc.

" 
Good morrow, most beautiful maid, 
Your beauty my heart so entrances!"

Says colleen dhas cruthen na moe.

" 
Let my tomb remain uninscribed and my memory in oblivion till my 
country shall take her place among the nations of the earth; till other 
times and other men shall do justice to my character. 
Then, and not 
till then, let my epitaph be written."—Einmet's Speech. 
W REN Erin shall stand 'mid the isles of the sea, 
Unburden'd, unfetter'd, " great, glorious, and free ;" 
When beacons of freedom shall light ev'ry vale, 
And the hearts of her tyrants before them shall quail. 
(Repeat for chorus.) 
When the standard of freedom unfurls to the breeze, 
That fans the fair emerald isle of the seas; 
When each billow that washes her ocean-worn strand, 
Rich tribute shall bring from each free happy land. 
(Repeat for chorus.) 
When the chains of oppression are broken and riven, 
And she stands among nations the favor'd of heaven; 
When her children shall wander as exiles no more; 
Till then let me rest on oblivion's dark shore. 
(Repeat for chorus.) 
When the music of liberty swells to the skies, 
From the flowers that bloom and the zephyr that sighs ; 
Till my country shall stand as a 
gem 'mid the free ; 
Till then let my epitaph unwritten be. 
(Repeat for chorus.) 
When the bonds of the brotherhood firmly shall hold 
Her children together like fetters of gold; 
When rejoicing and plenty shall circle the land, 
And her exiles return, as a 
free happy band. 
(Repeat for chorus.) 
YOU OUGHT TO BE WOUND UP. 
Igew local song, written and sung by J. H. RICAN 
with great success. 
Am.—" Tipperary Men." 
'
SLANG words now I'd have you know 
Have got to be the rage, 
Them you'll hear most everywhere, 
From the workshop to the stage, 
I'll tell you of the latest known, 
No matter where you stop, 
The cry is now, you are run down, 
And ought to be wound up, 
CHORUS. 
Don't try to talk a 
man to death 
For fear his friends might drop, 
And all would sing out in a 
breath, 
You ought to be wound up. 
Now if by chance you meet a 
friend 
As through the streets you walk, 
Of course you'll shake him by the hand, 
And for a 
while will talk, 
But some little boot-black standing by, 
Who may have seen you stop, 
'You are run down, he's sure to cry, 
Say; you ought to be wound up. 
Don't try, etc. 
Now even into politics 
This phrase you can discern, 
The friends of Grant were trying tricks 
To fix him a 
third term, 
But when they found a 
Hayes who did them please, 
They thought they'd better let it drop, 
Yes, I 
think it was best, you know the rest, 
The second term to wind him up. 
Don't try, etc. 
This phrase it is more useful 
Than those we have had of late, 
I'll prove it comes in truthful 
For either City or State. 
Think of the hard times that's gone by, 
Let us hope they soon will drop, 
For the voice of the people now does cry, 
It is time to wind them up. 
Don't try, etc.

KATIE OF KILLARNEY: 
Words by FRANK DUMONT'. 
Music by FRED B. 
NAYLOR. 
The Music of this song is Published by W. R. 
SMITH, 135 N. Eighth St.,-
Philadelphia, Pa. Price 30 cents. 
How sweet is old Ireland, its lakes and its blarney„ 
How dear each scene and its mem'ries to me; 
For sweet is the cot on the shores of Killarney, 
Where first Katie said, how happy we'll be. 
But time since then has parted us both, 
With sorrowing heart I 
cross'd the blue sea, 
My heart is in Erin, though far I 
may roam,. 
I've left it with her who is thinking of me. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet is the cot on the banks of Killarney, 
Sad was the time when I 
cross'd the blue sea. 
I 
left my heart with sweet little Katie, 
Left it with her who is thinking of me. 
I'll work late and early, my darling, for thee, 
Your face will cheer me wherever I 
go, 
For near me forever your blessings will be, 
And that will cheer me in sorrow I 
know; 
But, darling, in spring the flowers will come, 
And so will the day when no more we shall part, 
I'll come to old Ireland, the land that I 
love, 
Again as of yore press thee close to my heart. 
Sweet is the cot, eta.,

THE GALLANT FIRE BRIGADE. 
Written and sung by J. 
H. 
RYAN, with immense success. 
SINCE the days of the Mulligan Guards 
To the Fogarty Musketeers, 
You have beard the songs of the various hordes 
Which daily still appears; 
But not a 
song has yet been sung 
Of what puts them in the shade, 
The noble-hearted, brave, true boys 
Of our gallant Fire Brigade 
CHORUS. 
As we ride, we ride along through the street, 
And throwing pretty kisses to all the girls we meet, 
Don't we look fine though when we are on parade, 
As we march, as we march in our gallant Fire Brigade. 
When the alarm bell we hear, 
What more can you desire 
To see the way the sbreets we clear 
When we are going to a 
fire ! 
We strike out bright with all our might, 
And of nothing we're afraid, 
For the boys will give a 
hearty cheer 
For our gallant Fire Brigade 
As we ride, eta. 
We must away, we cannot stay, 
For 'fraid of us you tire, 
For we must be at our post 
If wanted for a 
fire; 
So while we're gone you toast our song, 
And hope we'll never fade, 
But live for many a 
glorious deed 
In our gallant Fire Brigade 
As we ride, etc. 
TITM GALWAY RIFLE CORPS. 
Written and sung by J. H. RYAN in his successful sketch the " Irish 
Settler. 
Ant.—" Boulevard." 
On, here we are an Irish pair, 
We're sprigs of the real ould stock, 
We are landed here about a 
year, 
In the City of New York; 
We have joined a 
squad from the shamrock's sod, 
About a 
month or more, 
And from town to town we have won renown 
In the Galway Rifle Corps. 
CHORUS. 
For with spirits gay we march away, 
And our feet are never sore; 
At the word of command we march so grand, 
In the Galway Rifle Corps. 
Our captain's name is McNally, 
And he came from sweet Tralee; 
He is just the sort for raising sport 
When he goes on a 
spree; 
If to our ball you make a 
call, 
You'll find whiskey in galore, 
For one and all both great and small, 
With the Galway Rifle Corps. 
For with, etc. 
So we must away without delay, 
For we hear the bugle's call ; 
We must take our stand at the word of command, 
Then into line we'll fall, 
With the volunteers amidst hearty cheers; 
No matter how the rain will pour, 
On St. Patrick's day we march so gay, 
In the Galway Rifle Corps. 
Written and sung with charming success by J. IL RYAN in his irreproach• 
able sketch, entitled, " The Irish Settler." 
Am.—" Live as Long as I 
can." 
W E are a 
happy old Irish couple, 
Whose days are nearly gone, 
We've seen a 
deal of trouble, 
But now we are left alone, 
We once were very happy, 
. 
Och, with our family, 
But now they are miles, miles far, far 
In Ireland o'er the sea. 
CHORUS. 
We're growing old and feeble, 
And white gray is our hair, 
But although we're old 
Round here we are told 
We are a 
happy old Irish pair. 
There was time in Ireland, 
To recollection now we bring, 
HE.—When a 
boy I 
was so joyful, 
SHE — And I 
with any young girl could sing; 
BOTH. — But now we are growing old, 
No such sights as those are seen, 
Our girls so gay when the pipes would play 
Dancing on our village green. 
We're growing, etc.

THE 17TH OF MARCH. 
Composed and sung by Mr. J. 
H. 
RYAN. 
AIR.—" 1776." 
TRUE Irishmen, they still turn out, 
Be the weather foul or fair, 
With the green flag floating o'er them, 
As they march around -Union Square; 
With our marshals too in grand array, 
I 
tell you it's first rate 
To see them out on Patrick's Day, 
Which we Irish celebrate. 
CHORUS. 
For we have not yet forgot 
The days of ' 98, 
We have not yet forgot 
When we did the Saxon bate, 
History sure can tell 
How the Irish fought and fell in 1798. 
It was in 1798 they bravely met the foe, 
Although sad has been old Ireland's fate, 
They laid many a 
Saxon low; 
For like Washington when 
He crossed the Delaware 
With his united band, 
The true sons of old Ireland strove 
To free their native land. 
For we have, etc. 
So my advice to Irishmen, 
E'er before I 
go away, 
Let no politics your clubs disband, 
But unite without delay ; 
So with your rifles in your hands, 
Why, make a 
grand display 
To free your own dear native land 
On some future Patrick's Day. 
For we have, etc.

HONEST MIKE MALLOY. 
Written and sung by J. II. RYAN in his original Irish sketch, " Just 
Landed." 
Ain.—" Larry Doolen." 
GOOD evening to you one and all, 
Your bright smile gives me joy; 
I 
am not long from Donegal, 
And ray name is Mike Malloy; 
I 
used to drive a 
jaunting car, 
And as you may understand, 
I 
am a 
poor coach driver now 
In this free and happy land. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
drive away both night and day, 
With a 
true and trusty hand; 
I'll drive you down to Rockaway, 
Or the Central Park so grand; 
My carriage is neat, my horse is fleet, 
So the trip you will enjoy, 
And the driver to be trusted is 
Poor honest Mike Malloy. 
When I 
was leaving Ireland 
From my heart came many a 
sigh, 
As I 
stood upon the dock, 
And bid my friends good-bye; 
But when I 
landed on this shore 
My heart was filled with joy, 
For a 
welcome here was in galore, 
For poor honest Mike Malloy. 
For I, etc. 
So now I'll bid you all good-bye, 
It's time I 
was away, 
I 
must go and stable up my horse, 
For we've both worked hard all day; 
My stand is down on Chatham square, 
And if me you will employ 
You will find your dealings always fair 
With poor honest Mike Malloy. 
For I, eta 
BARNEY, 
COME BACK TO ME. 
As sung by Miss JOSIE Mons's, with the " Grand Hibernica." 
BARNEY, come back from o'er the Atlantic, 
Back to the heart that is longing for thee; 
Ever I'm waiting to see in the distance, 
The ship that is bearing you, darling, to me. 
Long have I 
waited, waited so lonely, 
Why did I 
let you go forth from my heart, 
My lips for your kisses are eagerly waiting, 
Barney, no never again shall we part, 
• 
Barney, no never again shall we part. 
ClIORIIS. 
Barney, my lips for your kisses are waiting, 
Why did I 
let you go forth from my heart, 
Long have I 
waited, yes waited so lonely, 
Barney, no never again shall we part. 
Barney, return, the shamrock is blooming, 
Nature is smiling in valleys and dells; 
Darling, I'm waiting where first we did wander, 
Where oft we heard ringing the dear village bell' 
Oft have you said you'd ne'er forget Kathleen, 
Your colleen, you left in that cot o'er the sea, 
I've prayed for the hour when we shall be meeting, 
Barney, do hasten my darling to me, 
Barney, do hasten my darling to me. 
Barney, my lips, etc.

cessful Irish sketch, " Shandy McGuire." 
AIR.—" Danny Dear." 
On, Nellie darling, come with me 
Across the deep blue sea; 
The good ship she is bound to sail 
At the morning's break of day, 
So cheer up, my Nellie dear, 
For to you I'll prove true, 
Sure I'll work both day and night 
To bring happiness to you.

iS hard to leave old Ireland 
And my kind friends far behind, 
And the playmates of my youth, 
Who to me were kind. 
HE. — But remember, Nellie dear, 
How happy we will be 
In our own bright happy home 
Where all men are free. 
So cheer up, etc.

THE IRISH REFUGEE. 
Written by JAKE BERRY, Esq., expressly for J. II. RYAN, and sung wit 
great success by him in his great tableaux farce, entitled " Barney' 
Arrival and an Irishman's Honor." 
"Am.—Shabby Genteel." 
I 
AM just from old Ireland over the sea, 
And now I 
am happy, content; 
I 
left my dear home for this land of the free, 
And I 
hope I 
shall never repent; 
My father and mother still live over there, 
In a 
cottage that stands by the sea; 
Oh how they were crying when I 
came away, 
For I 
am a 
poor Irish Refugee. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
left my old home for the land of the free, 
God bless this land of sweet liberty ; 
May her bright sous like me never be, 
A 
wandering poor Refugee. 
My outside appearance to you may seem rough, 
But it is not the clothes makes the man; 
A 
working man's suit for me is good enough, 
Let us all do the best that we can ; 
I'll stand by this country as long as I 
live, 
For I 
love to be with them that's free, 
For I 
know fin American will never go back 
On a 
poor Irish Refugee. 
For I 
left, etc. 
• 
God bless the land that gave Washington birth, 
And may its good laws never die; 
He made them for lovers of freedom on earth, 
For a 
good thing they are to stand by ; 
And may the good laws for a 
thousand years hence 
Prosper by land and by sea, 
And may the Americans under no pretence 
Refuse a 
welcome to a 
poor Refugee. 
For I 
left, eta.

My coat is cloth, and honest bought, 
And not raggety at that; 
My knee-breeches too I 
wear, 
Without a 
patch or tear 
For they were the style in Erin's Isle, 
In happy days of yore. 
But represent, etc. 
But in this enlightened age 
It seems to be the rage, 
With painted nose and torned clothes, 
The feature of the stage,

To the greatest men on earth, 
Is ridiculed and buffooned without talent, wit or mirth.

UP TO THE MARL 
Written and sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
Wait for the Turn of the Tide." 
'Tis well to be up to the mark, my boys; 
Just look at the days gone by, 
When Washington planted our flag, my boys, 
And raised our bright banner on high; 
When Jefferson stood by this land of the free, 
And Lafayette too, he fought in the field 
When first shone our stars in the face of the foe, 
Those stars and those stripes which never did yield. 
CHORUS. 
For these men were up to the mark, my boys, 
They brought sweet sunlight from the dark, 
They made this great land where we live, my boys, 
And proved themselves up to the mark! 
And they'll find before long the north pole, my boys, - 
Or travel that northern sea through; 
Or die at their post like brave hail, my boys, 
Midst the icebergs of cold eighty-two, 
We Yankees, ' tis said, through the world, my boys, 
Do not know the meaning of defeat or fail; 
Our banner shall there be unfurled, my boys, 
The future will soon tell of the tale. 
CHORUS. 
We've men left like Morton and Hayes, my boys; 
One failure but kindles the spark; 
And brings to the surface them all, my boys, 
These men that are up to the mark. 
Dear Ireland, that's over the seas, my boys, 
Has got a 
bright record to show; 
Since Sarsfleld he fought for the cause, my boys, 
And trod down the base Saxon foe. 
O'Connell he struggled with might, my boys, 
Brave Emmett he gave his dear life; 
Their sons will continuo the fight, my boys, 
Till the shamrock does win in the strife. 
CHORUS. 
So list to the words of this song, my boys, 
I Though now you may seem in the dark, 
A good time will come for the Irish, my boys, 
And they'll prove themselves up to the mark.

SAY YOU'RE SINGLE. 
A 
new comic song, composed and sung by J. 
H. 
RYAN. 
As through this world I 
jog along, 
Though some of course may think it wrong,' 
I 
have found it best in every throng, 
Where I've been obliged to mingle, 
Especially in such a 
pleasant place, 
As where ladies go to waltz with grace, 
And almost in every other case, 
To always say you're single. 
Cnoncs.—So gents in the chorus mingle, 
Let all your voices jingle, 
For here, there and everywhere, 
It's hest to say you're single. 
I 
went one night to a 
fancy ball, 
And there I 
danced with nearly all, 
Where a 
maid in love with me did fall. 
Her name was Dolly Grindell, 
With her brother I 
had cigars and wine, 
Her mother said I 
danced divine; 
It was all because that I 
so shine, 
Told Dolly I 
was single. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, yes; talk as you like, there's nothing like a' 
single life after all. 
In the first place there's the la de da de 
George or dry good's clerk who jumps the counter about one 
hundred and ninety-nine times a 
day for about seven dollars a 
week, still nevertheless you can find those fellows at summer 
pie-flies, enjoying themselves with as many airs and graces as a 
rising politician, dressed in a 
first cost price duster, a cheap 
John white plug, twenty-five cent gold studs, paper linens, etc. 
Ah, but observe the contrast, see that young man about six 
months after he is married, an old slouch instead of a 
plug, 
plain china instead of studs ; in fact, he is the remains of 
shabby gentility and a 
good picture of a 
poor married man. 
Next, there is the single young mechanic, one of those devil-
may-care sort of fellows you know, who works hard all the 
week, gets his wages of a 
Saturday night, calls to see his 
friends at the little store around the corner, gets as tight as a 
piper, comes rolling home about two or three in the morning, 
looks for the key-hole on the wrong side of the door, finally 
kicks it in, knocks down the boarding- mistress in the entry, 
tumbles upstairs to bed or lays on the floor as the case may be, 
wakes up in the morning feeling as if there was a 
barrel of 
sawdust in his throat, drinks a 
basin of starch water, goes off 
to his work feeling as stiff as an alderman after the day of elec-
tion, so gentlemen as I 
said before. one and all 
In my chorus mingle, 
Let all your voices jingle, 
Here, there and everywhere, 
It's best to say you're single. 
EILEEN AND BARNEY. 
Written and sung by J. H. RYAN and Miss NELLIE VINCENT IR their 
beautiful Irish sketch called " Eileen Allanna." 
Am.—" Dont go, Mollie." 
EILEEN. 
YOU'RE leaving old Ireland, oh, Barney Machree, 
'It's breaking my heart for your sake I 
will be, 
Tis little yon know when you're far away, 
Don't cross the seas, Barney acushla Machree. 
(Repeat.) 
BARNEY. 
Dark is the night and the tempest loud roar, 
And I'm watching here from the bleak ocean shore; 
It's sad for to leave you, my Eileen Machree, 
I 
must cross the ocean, the new world to see. 
(Repeat.) 
Then sad is our parting, Eileen, don't fear. 
I'll comfort your heart and your spirits I'll cheer ; 
I'll soothe you in sorrow, and words I 
will say, 
Then Eileen, my darling, I 
must go away. 
(Repeat.) 
EILEEN. 
Then Barney, my darling, just heed what I 
say, 
Your poor aged father is pining away, 
So Barney, be said by your father and me, 
Don't cross the seas, Barney acushla Machree. 
(Repeat.) 
BARNEY. 
Now Eileen, my darling, the anchor is weighed, 
The ship is now ready to sail o'er the seas ; 
I 
am off to America, the land of the free, 
So fare you well, Eileen, I 
musl, be away ; 
'Tis but for a 
while I 
will bid you adieu, 
But Eileen my darling to you I'll prove true ; 
For my heart's in your keeping where'er I 
may roam, 
So cheer up, my Eileen, I'll return soon home.

THE ADVENTURES OF PADDY WATERS. 
Written and sung with great success by J. H. RYAN. 
My father was a 
man that was well known 
In the days of Torn and Jerry, 
He had often beat imposters down, 
And made the people merry; 
So I 
hope I 
wont shock the modesty 
Of any of your sons and daughters, 
While you listen to the adventures 
Of poor Irish Paddy Waters. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps some of you 
may deem it necessary to know who I 
am. 
Well, I 
am my fa-
ther's son, and they do say it's a 
wise child that knows his own 
father, so you'll give me credit for knowing a 
little. 
You see 
I've come all the ways from Ireland after some property left 
me by my mother's brother's first cousin's father's uncle. 
I've 
been a 
long time trying to find out where it is, but I 
am afraid 
it's so far off yet I'll never get rich at it. 
Sure I 
asked a 
lawyer 
the other day what I'd best do about it, and he told me to put 
it in a 
sinking fund. 
So I 
did. 
I 
went to a 
cemetery and put 
it in the hands of a 
grave digger, and buried the lot as a 
bad 
job. 
To add to my misfortune I 
got married, and had kids 
named Tommy and Joey. 
As for Tommy, his face to my know-
ledge didn't destroy the skin of a 
cent's worth of soap for the 
past twelve months, and as for Joe, why he didn't have as much 
clothes upon his back as would dust the flies off a 
sugar hogs-
head in summer time. 
I 
used then to reside in that aristocrat-
ic locality of Baxter avenue, a 
brown stone front do you mind, 
the tip toe part of the rear house, two steps up a 
cellar. 
But 
one big rainy night we had a 
flood in the cellar, so you were to 
see me, and Tommy, and Joey, tied on me back, and I 
swim-
ming about the cellar, and I 
singing, " Steer my bark to Erin's 
Isle," and there was my wife Molly, now, and she perched upon 
the stove singing, " There's a 
good time coming," after that she 
caught cold and died. 
Ah, but she died splendid. 
She dyed 
black, so one night to cheer my spirits up, I 
got pouring spirits 
down to such an extent that I 
got as tight as a 
fiddler, and com-
ing through the street I 
commenced to sing a 
little song some-
thing after this style: 
At the side of the road near the bridge up at Harlem, 
Poor Martin O'Hara was stationed to beg, 
lie brought from the war as his share of the piunder 
The loss of an eye and short of a 
leg. 
Arrah, Martin O'Gra, Martin O'Hara, 
Shure why did you list for a 
soldier on sea, 
You know you were much better off home in Brooklyn, 
Not over here in New York on the 12th of July. 
SPOKEN.—But before I 
got the last word out of my mouth I 
got a 
belt from an officer that sent me scattered like a 
basket

of oysters off the sidewalk. 
When I 
got leave to stand up the 
cop says, " I 
want you." " For what 1" says I. " I 
am look-
ing for another fellow all night, and you'll do as well. 
Come 
on." " But I 
did nothing," says I. " Neither did I," says he, 
" 
for the last month, so come on ; I'd take up my father if I 
met 
him," so I made resistance, and he rapped his club for 
assistance till 
he had as many policemen around me as 
was guarding the Italians on the Longshoremen's strike. 
So 
when I 
saw myself surrounded by the barn door savages, 
I thought I 
might as well go, and that's the place they 
will fatten you. 
All the food I 
got to eat was three oyster 
shells and a 
steel pen. 
Faith, if you staid there a 
month you'd 
come out as fat as a 
gas- pipe. 
Next morning I 
was brought 
before the judge. " What's the charge ?" says he ; " Drunk 
and disorderly," says the cop. " That's a 
lie," says I. " Shut 
up," says the cop, " I 
am speaking in your favor." 
And sure 
I 
know he was, for he wanted to send me to rusticate for about 
six months on the island. " What have you to say for yourself 1" 
says the judge. 
So I 
put on a funeral face and spoke as fol-
lows: " I 
am a 
stranger in the country, your honor, and I 
was 
only on ticket- of- leave from Castle Garden when I 
met the con-
stable and politely asked him what time it was, when he up 
with his club, struck me, knocked me down, and said it just 
struck one. 
And if it had to strike three or four I'd been a 
dead man by this time." " Ha, ha," says the judge, " that's a 
serious charge against the policeman. 
Where is that officer'?" 
But he couldn't see him, for he was one of those chicken-
hearted fellows ; his limbs got disjointed from the effects of 
false swearing; he fainted, and I 
was discharged. 
After I 
got 
out of that mess I 
joined the order of temperance. 
The first 
night I 
joined they had no speaker, so they asked me to make 
a 
speech or give the people a 
lot of old gab to pass the time 
away. I 
spoke as follows : 
Mr, President, ladies and gentle-
men, boys, girls, old maids and little children, the seeds of in-
temperance I 
am about to scatter amongst you. 
Gather up 
and gather round, says I, but as soon as I 
got as far as gather 
up there happened to be an Italian from Cork in the crowd, 
who honored out, " Young roan, if you mean to insult me by 
the word gather them up, that's my trade, and the sooner you 
gather yourself down out of there the better, so that ended my 
speech-making, and now I 
am married again, although my wife is 
a 
step-mother, yet she keeps everything cosy, the children's faces 
black-leaded, the stove whitewashed, so now I'll end by saying: 
I 
hope I 
haven't shocked the modesty 
Of any of your sons and daughters, 
While you've listened to the Adventures 
Of poor Irish Paddy Waters.

ARBAH, to New York I came from the sweet County 
Louth, 
Where I 
called on a 
friend for to show me around; 
He brought me through streets, lanes, and avenues so 
grand, 
Till my feet got so tired that I 
could hardly stand; 
He showed me Trinity steeple, built ever so tall, 
The grand new Post Office and big City Hall, 
But the name of all places I 
cannot relate,

Where Italian and Jew will sell you for new, 
Boiled up old clothes, both brown, black and blue,

Convenient to sweet Baxter Street, there is a 
store, 
Where a 
man day and night like a 
jackass does roar, 
They call him Cheap John, and he does a 
good trade, 
And he'll tell you that that's how the money is made. 
As he stands up so high he'll show you all kinds of things, 
Big brass gold watches, likewise brass gold rings, 
But one-half what he's got there I 
cannot relate, 
So they tell me he started in sweet Baxter Street. 
Where Italian, etc. 
We got loose from this place, both myself and my friend, 
I 
thought the least I 
could do, was a 
quarter to spend. 
We went into a 
place where we saw such a

Is this what you call Governor's Island recruits ? 
Ask the divil, says .one, his plate and all at me shoots, 
Then they all roared with laughter while I 
tried to retreat, 
So that commenced my adventures in sweet Baxter Street. 
Where Italian, etc. 
My friend tried me into the street for to shove, 
When a 
policeman jumped in and struck me with his club, 
My blood then being up my stick I 
let fly, 
So I 
battered his head and I 
blackened his eye. 
Run or they'll hang you, I 
heard somebody cry, 
But I 
couldn't for the clam soup had scalded my eye, 
So I 
there was arrested and to the station marched straight, 
Curse my adventures in sweet Baxter Street. 
Where Italian, etc. 
They all gathered round me like bees round a 
cask, 
When the judge, if guilty I 
was, he did ask, 
But when my accuser stood up to charge me with the 
crime, 
It was my own brother Teddy I'd fought all the time. 
When he saw me he let out a 
thundering screech, 
And cursed the day the alderman put him on the police. 
But he spoke to the judge and he got me off neat, 
To go home and stay far away from Baxter Street. 
Where Italian, etc.

A NEW LOCAL SONG. 
Written on the Pollee Raids, and sung by J. H. RYAN with great succeas. 
Au.—" King of the Cannibal Islands." 
0, HAVE you heard the news of late, 
The news that bothers every pate, 
Whether of high or low estate ? 
It is the law of Sixty-Two, sirs; 
No matter how much its weight you feel, 
From this law there's no appeal; 
But O'Gorman says to show your zeal, 
And your wounded pride to heal. 
Liquor's getting clearer every day, 
The poor man for good stuff can't pay 
On account of heavy license by the way, 
Through this anti-liquor law, sirs. 
CHORUS. 
The country is in the devil's hubboo, 
Arrah, what's poor people going to do, 
If our simple pleasure they will pursue 
By this law of Sixty-Two, sirs. 
New York is in an uproar now, 
Liquor dealers are looking fierce, and vow 
They have their doubts if they'll allow 
This anti-liquor law, sirs. 
Many a 
poor performer ponders o'er 
The dollars he's often had in store, 
But now they're gone his heart is sore 
Since the law of Sixty-Two, sirs,

shame to have to say 
That in this great land of the free, 
Poor folks they can no pleasure see ; 
Since the law of Sixty-Two, sirs, 
It matters little where you walk, 
This liquor law is all the talk; 
The fun-making knights of burnt cork 
Are sadly in despair too ; 
Private cops are running round like spies 
Assuming every mean disguise, 
Concert halls they do surprise, 
Since the law of Sixty-Two, sirs. 
The country, etc. 
What's poor singers and dancers going to do, 
Who are now dead broke, without a

For Smith and Walling will them pursue, 
Through the law of Sixty-Two, sirs. 
'Variety managers their best do try 
This shocking law for to defy, 
But pleasure-seekers are growing shy 
To enter places of amusement;

From that little isle so green,

We are few and far between. 
We always do our best to please, 
And act upon the square, 
Bat what do you think the people say, 
We're a

While I

And there to take the belle,

To drive away dull care, 
So what do you think the people say, 
We're a

And there have lots of fun, 
You'd soon be glad to carry the hod, 
And away from them to run.

And do what's right and fair, 
And win the people's kind applause,

VERSION OF 
THE EMIGRANT'S FAREWELL. 
Written and sung at the departure scene in the Panorama of Ireland, by 
J. 
H. 
RYAN. 
Au.—" The Dear Irish Boy." 
On, Erin, my country, though thousands now leave thee, 
After suffering privations which no tongue can tell, 
To see the pride of my country depart sore does grieve 
me, 
While their sighs fill the sails as they bid thee farewell; 
Our foes they are smiling while wealth they are piling; 
Our brave boys are toiling by land or by sea; 
Oh, land of great plenty, with barns and stores empty, 
Farewell dear ould. Erin—Acushla Machree. 
Oh, why is my country in sorrow and in danger ? 
You rulers of Ireland can best understand; 
'Tis because all our strongholds are held by the stranger, 
Our houses, our cattle, our farms, and our land, 
While my country declining far from her proud station, 
That once was the noble, the brave, and the free, 
And the pride of our people still seek emigration, 
Far away from ould Ireland—Acushla Machree. 
Though England may boast of her army and navy, 
And the conquests of old, which she ne'er fought alone, 
If a 
war should break out she may want a 
new levy, 
And need those poor exiles she is driving from home; 
or Irishmen ever in battle none braver, 
They fight like the tiger by land or by sea, 
And in all England's quarrels who won bright her laurels, 
Faugh an ballagh for Ireland—Aeushla Maehree.

MT 
name is McDonough, I'm a 
son of Erin's soil, 
At seven in the morning sure, begins my daily toil; 
And all the day, through heat and cold, I 
pick and dig away, 
And lay the trap-block pavement, on a 
street they calls Broad-
way; 
At home I 
have a 
family, a 
wife and three big boys, 
They nearly drive me crazy wid their fightin' and their noise; 
There's Roger and Fat Mickey and big Dan, that makes the 
three, 
But of all the gang fat Mickey sure he looks the most like me. 
CHORUS. 
Now there's Dan, handsome Dan, 
Sure he's the ladies' man; 
And Roger, he's the divil 
Wid his dancin' and his noise; 
But of all the boys we've none 
So fond of jolly fun 
As Mickey, darlin' Mickey, 
He's the best of all the boys. 
He's as broad as he is lengthy. and he weighs two hundred 
pounds, 
At atein' or at slapein' sure his like cannot be found; 
At snorin' he's the dIvil, now believe me whin I 
say, 
You can hear him snore from Tubby Hook across to Dublin 
Bay; 
And he can ate his size in mate, or pack the grub below, 
At drinkin' Irish whiskey sure, egad, he is not slow ; 
When he comes home at four o'clock, chock full of old benzine, 
You can bet your bottom dollar then some lively sights are 
seen. 
Now there's Dan, etc. 
He joined the " Doherty Fusileers," they put him in the squad, 
He could not hold a 
musket, so they gave him many a 
prod; 
He could not march into the ranks, bekase he was too fat, 
So says the Irish sarjint, " Mick, I'll bounce you out of that!' 
They made him carry the target thin and march up in the rear 
And on the street on Patrick's day you'll see him every year 
He walks along the boulevard, so proudly and so gay, 
And whin the girls observe him, sure you'll always hear the 
say— 
(I) 
Now there's Dan, etc. 
FAT MICRP.Y.—Concluded. 
They say at Philly-del-phia they're going to have a 
fair, 
And all the curiosities they tell me will be there ; 
I 
think I'll take fat Mickey there, and enter him for style, 
I 
know his fat appearuance will cause 'em all to smile; 
And if they give a 
premium for " lads that are not quick," 
I 
think he'll get the medal, sure, the boy we calls our Mick; 
For sure he is no good at all, he never worked a 
day, 
And if you say a 
word to him his mammy's sure to say— 
Now there's Dan, etc.

THE GREEN ISLE OF THE SEA. 
W ritten and Sung by J. 
H. 
RYAN. 
I am the son of an Irishman, 
In Dublin I 
was born; 
Where often you meet with a 
welcome hand, 
And you're seldom met with scorn. 
not ashamed to say 
It's the land of my birth ; 
Tho' it has got numerous foes, 
But I 
hope that freedom yet will shine 
Where that green little shamrock grows. 
CHORUS. 
Then there's not a 
spot, hurrah, my boys! 
Like that Green Isle of the sea ; 
Where the blooming little Shamrock grows, 
• Arrah, that's the land for me. 
I 
look on its mountains and its hills, 
Its lakes and valleys so grand; 
And read of the boys of 'OS, 
how they fought for Paddy's land. 
And our blue-eyed girls, with their hair in curls, 
But few of them now are seen; 
Because they were forced to emigrate 
From the Land of the Shamrock Green. 
Then there's not, &c. 
Think of the days of the great Brian Boni, 
Sarsfield, Fitzgerald, and Wolfe Tone; 
And let their spirits still remain, 
Although they're dead and gone. 
There's Emmett, and Owen Rowe and O'Connell. too, 
Who ne'er fear'd to demand ; 
midst our British Saxon foes, 
The rights of Paddy's Land., 
Then we'll hip hurrah, for Erin go Bragh, 
And one another befriend ; 
An I 
hope the day is drawing nigh, 
Old Ireland to defend. 
Don't talk to me of your Broadway swells, 
Nor rave about your Bowery belles, 
I'll tell you of the best of girls, 
A country little fairy. 
I'll sing to you of a 
girl I 
knew, 
She lived in Huntingdon, it's true: 
And if you listen you'll find there were mighty few 
Could equal Kate O'Leary. 
CHORUS. 
For she is just the girl you'd like to spark; 
Her eyes are blue and her hair is dark; 
Not from the Battery to Central Park 
Could you equal Kate O'Leary. 
Iler cheeks were red, and her eyes were blue; 
Her hair was dark, of the deepest hue; 
Tier foot was small and neat to view, 
And her heart was light and airy. 
Her voice was music to my ear; 
She had an Irish brogue, so rich and clear: 
The like again I'll never hear 
As from sweet Kate O'Leary. 
For she's just, duc. 
Although she had no " Grecian Bend," 
She had the hearts of all the men. 
For invitations they would send, 
For she danced just like a 
fairy. 
She was none too short, nor yet too tall— 
She had no " Chignon " nor " Waterfall ;" 
But faith the belle of any ball 
Was my charming Kate O'Leary. 
For she's just, d6o.

MURTY CAREY. 
Composed by J. H. RYAN, and sung by him in the Panorama of Ireland. 
Aim—" Sarah Walker." 
SURE I 
am an Irish boy; I 
came from sweet Fermoy, 
Where the boys' and girls' hearts are light and airy; 
'Tis in that little isle so green true fun is to be seen— 
Sure they can't compare with us in Tipperary. 
Since I 
was two days old, I 
often have been told 
That I 
was christened by one good old Father Leary, 
And the name that I've been called since I 
was two days old, 
Is the rollicking, roving Irish Murty- Carey. 
Then hurrah, my Irish boys, that's fond of fun and noise; 
There's not from Cork's own town to Tipperary, 
From Wexford to Fermoy, a &went Irish boy 
To equal -the roving Irish Murty Carey. 
I 
came over from old Ireland to this great counterie, 
Where I 
find my friends in many occupations ; 
And I'm proud on them to call, fOr they know me one and all, 
Because they're my own true blood relations. 
So as I 
sing my song, I'll name them one by one; 
You'll not wonder that my heart is light and airy, 
To see some in command of that gallant Fenian band, 
Sure it cheers the heart of Irish Murty Carey. 
First there's General Burke who from our cause did never 
shirk, 
And Savage, 'Halpin, Costello, and O'Mahony, 
There's John Mitchell and Luby too, Kickham and Martin 
true, 
Poor Mulcahy and honest John O'Leary. 
Generals Sheridan and Francis Meagher, who're famed both 
near and far, 
Not forgetting O'Donovan Rossa from Tipperary, 
Allen, Larkin and O'Brien, with our Cuban Martyr, Col. Ryan, 
Sure they're all blood first cousins to Murty Carey. 
TO DONNYBROOK FAIR. 
Composed and sung by J. H. RYAN. 
AIR.—" Limerick Fair." 
Now it was a 
Monday morning, 
In the pleasant month of May, 
As myself I 
took a 
jolly ride 
With charming Molly Gray, 
Whose eyes shone like the stars, 
And her cheeks were like the rose; 
I'll tell you all about it, 
Just as my story goes. 
CHORUS. 
But as I 
drive my jaunting car, 
I 
drive away dull care, 
And never can forget the day 
We went to Donnybrook Fair. 
And never can forget the day 
We went to Donnybrook Fair. 
Arrah, Molly had on her Sunday gownd, 
And I 
my Sunday coat; 
It was in my breeches pocket 
I 
had a 
one pound note, 
With an odd few shillings or so, 
And the whip was in my hand; 
She jumped upon my Irish car, 
And away we drove so grand. 
But as I 
drive, etc. 
But Molly and me both agreed 
To become man and wife, 
So the best we try in every way 
To be happy all our life, 
Or should the times be good or bad, 
We drive away dull care; 
We never shall forget the day 
We went to Donnybrook Fair. 
But as I 
drive, etc. 
So fill your glasses full, my friends, 
And give one toast with me; 
Here's success to dear old Ireland, 
The bright gem of the sea; 
Let us hope the day is drawing nigh, 
And may we live to see 
That poor, downtrodden Emerald Isle 
A 
land of liberty.

PAT O'HARA. 
Written by J. P. STEWAI1T, and Sung by BILLY Asncnori. 
I 
Am an Irish boy, and my heart is full of joy; 
I 
owe my breath to famous Limerick City, 
I 
can handle well the twig or flitter an Irish jig, 
Or give you a 
stave of a 
native ditty; 
My heart is seldom sad, I 
like to make folks glad, 
And the girls' eyes a 
twinkling like a 
star, Oh ! 
I'm always at my ease, for my friends I 
love to tease— 
I'm the rattling, rowling, teasing Pat O'Hara. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah ! my Irish boys, that's fond of fun and noise, 
There's not from Dublin down to Connemara, 
Or from Limerick to Kildare, a 
boy that can compare 
With rattling, rowling tearing Pat O'Hara. 
And on a 
pattern day my heart is light and gay, 
I 
frisk across the green sod light and gayly; 
I 
am always up for fun but was never known to run, 
For that would be disgrace to my shillaleb ; 
If a 
colleen too you see that's looking after me, 
And faix her name is Kitty McNamara, 
With two eyes as black as a 
sloe's that wherever I 
may go 
They are always chasing after Pat O'Hara. 
Hurrah ! my Irish boys, etc. 
I 
love the Emerald sod where in childhood first I 
trod, 
With its hills and valleys clothed in shamrocks green, 
And its colleens sweet and fair, few with them can compare, 
For their equal's mighty seldom to be seen sure ; 
Though the times have changed this while in dear ould 
Erin's Isle, 
And many have had to wanecler near and far, 0! 
Arrah ! just keep up your heart, you'll find that the better 
part, 
Tis the style that always pleases Pat O'Hara. 
Hurrah! my Irish boys, etc.

hear somebody whistling, Mary? 
MAX-Y.—Sure, it was the wind, mother. 
MOTHER sings. 
I've lived a 
long time, Mary, in this wide world, my dear; 
But the wind to whistle a 
tune like that I 
never before did 
hear. 
MARY sings. 
But, mother, you know the fiddle hangs just behind the 
chink, 
And the wind upon the strings of it is playing a 
tune, I 
think; 
Is playing a 
tune, I 
think.

THE WHISTLING THIEF.—[CoxrnmEn.] 
[PAT, outside, barks like a 
dog.] 
MOTHER sings. 
The dog is barking now, and a 
fiddle can't play a 
tune. 
MARY sings. 
But, mother, you know that dogs will bark when they see 
the moon. 
MOTHER sing*. 
But how can he see the moon, when you know he's old and 
blind; 
Blind dogs can't see the moon, nor fiddles be played by the 
wind, 
Nor fiddles be played by the wind. 
[PAT, outside, imitates a 
pig.] 
MOTHER sings. 
And there now is the pig,. oneasy in his mind. 
MARY sings. 
But, mother, you know the saying, that pigs can see the 
wind. 
MOTHER sings. 
That's all very well in the day, but allow me, miss, to re-
mark 
That pigs, no more than ourselves, can see anything In the 
dark, 
Can see anything in the dark. 
MOTHER.—SO, so, my daughter; get out wid your mum. 
You can't decave your ould mother. 
MARY.—But, mother dear. 
MOTHER.—Oh, go 'long wid ye. 
MOTHER sings. 
I'm not such a 
fool as ye think, I 
know very well it is Pat. 
[Goes to window.] 
Get out, ye whistling thief, and get along home out of that; 
(

THE WHISTLING THIEP.—[Coyme.en.] 
And you, miss, be off to your bed; don't bother me wid youx 
tears; 
For though I've lost my eyes, I 
haven't yet lost my ears, 
I 
haven't yet lost my ears. 
[Exit M OTHER, shaking her crutch at M ARY.] 
PAT (
at window).—Whist, Mary mavourneen! 
Darlint, aro 
you there ? 
MARY.—Yes, Pat; but be aisy, me mother is wide awake. 
PAT.—Oh, bad luck to her—I 
mane, God bless the ould 
woman. [Climbs through window.] 
MARY.—Oh, I 
know she'll hear us. 
If she does, sure she'll 
be after breaking every bone in your body. 
PAT.—What do you suppose I'd care for that ? 
MARY.—Don't come whistling round the door any more, 
Pat. 
You ought to know better. 
PAT.—Sure, I'll whistle now if you don't stop me mouth 
wid a 
kiss from those rosy lips of yours. 
MARY.—Oh, go along wid yer blarney. 
PAT.—Well, if you won't give me one I'll stale it. 
[Kisses 
her.] 
MOTHER (outside).—Mary, Mary, come in; what kapes yet 
so long? Do you want me to come and fetch yer? 
It's bed-
time an hour ago, sure. 
MARY.—Pat, go quick! 
PAT.—Bedad, I 
will. 
Good-bye, darlint. 
[Kisses her.] 
I'll 
go outside the same way I 
came in. 
[Jumps through the, win-
dow.] 
MARY.—I'm coming, mother dear. 
[Enter MOTHER.] 
MOTHER.-1S it all night you'd be after staying up? Come, 
along, yer ungrateful girl. 
Sure, yer head's so full of that 
whistling thief, Pat, that yer can't rest. 
Get in wid yer. 
MARY.—Yes, mother. 
L' 
Kisses hand at window.] 
[Exit MOTHER and MARY.] 
PAT (
leaning on window-sill). — When I 
ourne again, bedad. 
I'll come wid a 
still tongue in my head. 
Take my advice: 
(

THE WHISTLING THIEP.—[CONTINUED.] 
PAT sings. 
Now, boys, don't courting go too near to the house, d'ye mind; 
Unless you're certain sure the old woman's both deaf and 
blind; 
The days when they were young, forget they never can, 
They're able to tell the difference ' twist a 
fiddle, pig, dog 
and a 
man; 
A 
fiddle, pig, dog and a 
man.

Her face is always brightened with a

Faith, none with ray jewel can compare. 
She's the fairest, etc.

The thought of it cheers me on my way; 
The bells will ring, and the colleens will sing, 
When she names the happy wedding-day.

Thou with the sweet voice and cloud-cleaving wing, 
Shake from thy plumage the tears of the night, 
Haste where the splendors of morning invite ; 
Soar where the sinless and beautiful stray, 
Tell them my Norah's as lovely as they. 
CHORUS. 
She's the " Lily of Kerry 1" 
The fairest e'er seen 
In Erin the sea-girt, 
In Erin the green. 
Greet, in thy rapture, yon rose-scented dell, 
Deep in whose shadow my Norah cloth dwell: 
North, as pure as the pearls on the thorn, 
Bright as the golden hair'd-godd.ess of morn; 
She, from whose fairy-like fingers the flow'rs 
Fall on the meadows in odorous show'rs.

Free from all guile, and unconscious of wrong, 
Simple and sweet as thy silvery song.

We're coming solid to the front, 
Of that don't have a

The Mulligan's, the Hoolahan's, 
The Dougherty's and all, 
When we're paradin' thro' the streets, 
We drive them to the wall.

TOM BROWN he is a 
married man, with children four or five, 
All day he's deep in business, and in life he seems to thrive ; 
But when his daily toil is done, all round the streets he'll roam, 
And some time after midnight, you will find him rolling home! 
CHORUS. 
When Brown comes rolling home, 0, then he's in his glory; 
He loves to sing a 
song, or tell a 
jolly story; 
But there's a 
scolding wife that waits for him alone ; 
0, there's sure to be an awful row, when Brown comes rolling 
home! 
He circumvents the excise law upon the Sabbath day, 
And drinks his beer with right good cheer, no matter what they 
say ; 
He loves a 
schooner, tall and deep, with no great wealth of 
foam; 
A 
few of these are sure to please and send him rolling borne! 
When Brown, etc. 
At night he wakes his neighbors up, when pounding at the 
door; 
Sometimes it's two, sometimes it's three, and often after four; 
And where he stays till such an hour, the fact is never known, 
He says " it's business " all the time, that sends him rolling 
borne! 
When Brown, etc. 
Tie drinks a 
keg of lager bier, he quaffs the wine of Mumm ; 
And if he stands without support, he's slightly out of plumb 
But Brown heeds not his wavering steps, he cries out, " come 
boys, come ! 
We'll take a 
drink, a 
social drink, then I'll go rolling home !"

I'VE a 
son call'd James Fitzpatrick, 
Brought up like a 
dacent man, 
But lately he goes sportiu' round 
Wid Rafferty's big son Dan; 
He wears high collars and dandy dress, 
He drives a 
wagon for " Dodd's Express," 
But the house and home is in great disthress 
Since James put on high collars. 
CHORUS. 
He's out all night in his dandy clothes, 
He's always axin' for dollars ; 
I'm half distracted wid care and woe 
Sin w James put on high collars. 
At night, when all his work is done, 
He fixes himself wid care ; 
The high-toned collar goes round his neck, 
And lavender gloves he'll wear; 
He buys French pools and he drinks champagne, 
I 
talk to him, but it's all in vain. 
I 
hear the neighbors all round exclaim, 
" 
Look at James with his big high collars." 
He's out all night, etc. 
He goes to pic-nies and to balls, 
And dances the waltz-quadrille; 
It takes his wages every week 
To settle his tailor's bill ; 
With stylish ladies he loves to go, 
And wants to put up for a 
first-class beau; 
Oh, I'm half distracted wid care and woe, 
Since James put on high collars. 
He's out all night, etc. 
BRIAN THE BRAVE. 
REMEMBER the glories of Brian the Brave, 
Though the days of the hero are o'er, 
Though lost to 3Iononia, and cold in the grave, 
He returns to Kinkorah no more! 
That star of the field which so often has poured 
Its beam on the battle, is set— 
But enough of its glory remains on each sword 
To light us to victory yet. 
Mononia 
when nature embellished the tint 
Of thy fields and thy mountain air so fair, 
Did she ever intend that a 
tyrant should print 
The footstep of slavery there ? 
No ! Freedom, whose smiles we shall never resign, 
Go tell our invaders, the Danes, 
That ' tis sweeter to bleed for an age at thy shrine, 
Than to sleep but a 
moment in chains. 
Forget not our wounded companions who stood 
In the days of distress by our side : 
While the moss of the valley grew red with their blood 
They stirred not, but conquered and died— 
The sun that now blesses our arms with his light, 
Saw them fall upon Ossory's plain! 
Oh! let him not blush, when he leaves us to- night, 
To find that they fell there in vain.

SAINT PATRICK was a 
gentleman, 
Sure his name we celebrate, 
And on the seventeenth of March 
The Irish concentrate; 
A 
bran- new hat on each man's bead, 
And a 
green necktie that's newly made; 
The left foot first, then lightly tread 
In the Patrick's day parade; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow, 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
CHORUS. 
We shout hurrah for Erin go bragb, 
And all the Yankee nation, 
Stars and stripes, and shamrock bright arrayed; 
The Irish shout, the girls turn out, 
To see the celebration; 
We march stiff as starch, 
In the Patrick's. day parade. 
You should see the marshal on his horse, 
Like Napoleon Bonyparte, 
And as be rides along the line, 
He'd break each lady's heart, 
And if the rain should fall down then, 
We hoist our umbrellas high, 
For history states that Irishmen 
Are always warm and dry; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc. 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
And though I'm not a 
drinking man, 
On that day I'd drink my beer; 
I'll wear the shamrock in my hat; 
The green, my boys, ' twill never fade, 
And march along with Dan an' Pat, 
In the Patrick's day parade; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patriele@ day parade. 
We shout hurrah, eta.
