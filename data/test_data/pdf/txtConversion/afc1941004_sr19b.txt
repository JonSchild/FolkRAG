John Lomax: Dr. Terrill, I've had a telegram from Washington asking me to secure the reactions of
four or five average men and women to the Japanese aggression. I'd like to get yours and before you
give this reaction will you please identify yourself?
Dr. James J. Terrill: I am Dr. James J. Terrill of Dallas, Texas, a practicing physician limiting my practice
to mental and nervous diseases. I've been practicing for about thirty-nine years. I grew up in Texas,
although I was born in Missouri. Grew up in a small town, taught school for two years before I
studied medicine and then taught in the medical college at Galveston for about eleven years. And
since then, I've been practicing mental and nervous diseases.
[long pause] You asked about my reaction to the news of the Japanese aggression. First, it was
unbelieving surprise. And then the horror that any nation could so attack another nation while
negotiations were still going on. After I realized that the news was true then the next realization was
that I personally was at war. Not the country was at war, but that I was at war. That everything that I
had and all that I could do should go into it.
Realizing, of course, my physical limitations I felt that everything else I had and could do should
be devoted to the cause of winning the war. I don't believe in war as a way of settling things, but
I do believe that it is the only method sometimes forced on us. And that if we get into it that the
quickest way that we can win the war will be the one that will save the most lives. Just what my
contribution will be will have to be determined by those who know the full program, the full picture.
In the meantime, until I'm told what I'm going to do or what I should do, I'm going to go ahead with
my daily duty, work that I've been doing supplementing that with such suggestions and help as I
myself can think of giving, cooperating thoroughly with those in authority in so as far as my ability
goes.

John Lomax: And have long have you lived in Dallas?
Mike Stephens: I've been living in Dallas ever since 1934, which is about seven years.
John Lomax: What are you doing in Dallas?
Mike Stephens: Well, I'm working in Dallas. I'm a house man, chauffeur, cook, and a yard man.
John Lomax: Washington wants to know, Mike, what do you think about this war with Japan?
Mike Stephens: Well, my thoughts about the war, which I've been thinking over for some
considerable time and reading, are I figure we have a hard task to do. Is because since our friendship
with our [assistant (?)] countries there's nothing for us to do, but go into it with all force, with all
might, and with all strength and ask God to teach us and direct us the right path, that we can see the
right thing, that we'll come out more than conqueror.
John Lomax: Well, what do the [colored people (?)] in general think of this situation Mike?
Mike Stephens: Well, the general colored-people I believe will speak the same in [portion (?)] with me,
what I'm saying now. Is because in talking with different ones they talk the same thing.
John Lomax: Well, do you find them willing to bear their part and pick up arms and fight for their
country?
Mike Stephens: Well, yes. I believe they feel like I felt when the news heard over the radio that
Japan had declared war on the United States. Everybody felt in sorrow and woke up with a strong
determination. Mine is to go forward, to do the best they could. Is because this is our country and
this is our place to live and everything here is prepared for us and we don't want no other dictator
over us.
