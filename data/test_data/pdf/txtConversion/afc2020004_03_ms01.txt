Transplant: After Georgia O’Keeffe’s Pelvis IV, 1944 
 
-for that 26-year-old in Florida 
 
Wolves have two stomachs, I only have one 
Inside their den, regurgitation of skeleton and then another 
 
There is quiet now in our hospital rooms 
Ventilator’s tail pulled from electrical socket 
 
Parents weep a lake. A sky and moon, too 
They weep a pelvis. It hangs in a museum 
 
I steal your hip bone, tuck it deep inside my pocket 
Where else does a love note fit if not next to a groin 
 
The hip’s eye blue nests a moon  
I disguise myself from God 
 
Black robed messenger, two buzzards fight for a kidney 
Your mother writes He never met a stranger 
 
O’Keeffe in the desert, her pilgrimage, a transplant 
Long after the buzzards and wolves have left 
 
Two pictures of your strangerless face in the post 
Two blue eyes, spring starflowers harvested from God’s garden 
 
Organs reaped from a body I didn’t sow 
Such porcelain gifts a fragile body sows 
 
I ingest dissolvable moons so that we become strangers 
Two skeletons of different stomachs: 
 
One lost in the desert, the other a planet, a god 
A wolf swallows his own rib to rebuild all of us
