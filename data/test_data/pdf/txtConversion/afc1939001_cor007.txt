[Letter from Harold Spivacke to John A. Lomax; Port
Aransas, TX]
January 30, 1939
Mr. John A. Lomax Port Aransas, Texas
Dear Mr. Lomax:
Before I can recommend that you be reimbursed for mileage and per-diem, I must have
more specific information regarding your plans. Can you tell me approximately how long
each trip will take, the approximate mileage to be covered, and how many discs you will
need?
The places I had in mind for you to cover were New Mexico, Arizona, and perhaps
Colorado. Since you plan to come to Washington this Spring, however, it may be best to
defer work in this territory until a later date.
Alan assures me that the machine is in good repair and I shall send it to you soon. Will you
need the batteries and converter? Alan thought not.
With kindest regards,
Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
