Scott Pullman interviewed by Jaime Lopez 
This interview was really based off of all of the awesome stories that we get to 
share with each other on the job site, so as an apprentice and journeyman you 
always get to share time with these people, and get to know them, but a lot of 
times you separate, and then you may not ever see them again, and you lose 
the words, and the things that you shared. This is like honoring those 
conversations, and honoringthose relationships, and honoringthe people that 
do that type of work, so I'm just going to go down and begin [00:00:30] by 
telling us your name, and your job title. 
My name is Scott Pullman, and I'm an electrician, Local three electrician, journey 
person. 
What division are you in? 
A division. 
Can you tell us about your background where you were born. 
I was born in the Bronx. I moved out here when I was little I guess after three 
years old I moved to Plainview, Long Island. I grew up there. [00:01:00] I come 
from a Jewish background. My father is really not a religious guy. My mother is 
not religious at all. That was it. I thought I had a normal childhood. I hung out 
with some guys. Actually, my good friends were Irish, and Italian, a couple of 
Jews, Spanish guy, and that was it, you know, we were good. Everybody was 
good. It was a good gig. 
Where were your parents from originally? 
[00:01:30] My mother was from Flushing. Her parents were from Jersey, but her 
heritage I guess it comes back from they were from Russia, so they were Russian 
Jews, and I guess they fled her parents years ago. She's probably already five 
generations. My father was from the Bronx. Co-op city is the last thing I 
remember. I was born in Bronx-Lebanon. [00:02:00] My mother, my 
grandmother, his mother was from Poland. She was Jewish from Poland, and his 
father was from I like to say I'm not sure he was Italian Catholic. He was from 
Italy. I don't know if they went to Buenos Aires first, and then they came here. It 
was a way to get to the U nited States. 
What [00:02:30] neighborhood do you live in now? 
I live in Massapequa.

I know I asked this before, we just spoke about it, but how many years have you 
been in the business? 
I came in the business in July of 1984, so I guess I'm coming up on 34 years. 
What type of work do you find yourself doing now what types of work? 
Right now what I was doing was just really, you know, like we [00:03:00] do all 
the time piping wire, and that's what I do, that's what we do. Right now I was 
just doing building racks for a set of pipes for the East Side Access job, which is 
probably the biggest job in the country right now, or the biggest job on the 
North Atlantic, right? 
Can you describe the East Side Access and what it looks like? 
Well, right now we were on the bottom of the Grand Central, so they were 
making the tunnels, and they want to connect I think into all the Penn Stations. 
Is that right? I'm [00:03:30] not sure. I think it's from Penn Station. I was only 
there for a few weeks, and then before that I was in the subways, so I was doing 
some subway work, so that's pretty much what I've been doing for the last year 
and a half. That was good work, you know, going to the relay room building 
some racks, doing the lighting, pulling fiber through the manholes, and that 
went all the way from U nion Turnpike to Roosevelt. [00:04:00] That was a good 
job. UnionTurnpike and Queens to Rooseveltand Queens. 
How did you become an electrician? 
How did I become an electrician? I think when I went to school I was going to 
Plainview here, Plainview High School. I was intelligent, but I wasn't the best 
student. We had a couple of friends, and my good friends everybody was their 
father or their uncle somebody was connected into Local three. [00:04:30] I was 
doing some cement work with my buddy in Kilkenny. It was great work, and 
then I working at panel trim I was doing cabinet work. Then my old man said, 
"Listen, if you're going to work with your hands you got to get into Local three, 
bar none." At that time my father was actually an engineer in Local three. He 
actually went to school at night. He was pumping gas, and he got into that 
through night. I think he was pumping gas for Metco who was a Local three 
company, and they brought him in. That's really how [00:05:00] I got in. Me and 
my friends we all went in. 
Are you a first-generation electrician? Do you have any family in the business? 
I'm a first-generation electrician. I'm a second-generation Local three, so my 
father was an engineer. When he started he was doing drawings, and then he 
just started doing like taking people out, you know, charismatic guy, and 
working for an individual Local three company, so [00:05:30] I guess I'm second- 
generation.

You said you were describing your job site at the East Side Access, and how that 
was connecting some? 
I think it's connecting to Penn Station. 
Forthe people who are goingto be listeningto this interview can you just 
describe what it is to go into the job, and what is it that you see when you enter 
the job site, and working in that environment? 
Well, what do you do? What you do is [00:06:00] you walk in. What you do is 
you walk in, so the job went from 49th Street, or 52nd I think. We went in at 
53rd to, and this is underground, 53rd all the way to I think 42nd, so now you're 
talking 11 blocks underground. [00:06:30] That goes 11 blocks, so you walk in, 
and it's pretty much a straight walk. It's just every trade is down there. A lot of 
electricians down there. A lot of different companies, but everybody's down 
there. The carpenters are down there. The plumbers are down there. The 
cement workers are down there. There's backhoes down there. It's a big job, so 
next year when you're working you can see the Metro-North Railroad, 
[00:07:00] and we're doing it forthe trains, and it's just something where I guess 
there's about I don't know I would have to say 150 people down there right 
now, and it's just starting. I mean people come every day, so I'm sure they'll be 
five, six hundred people there, I'm sure. 
Let's come back to because you've been working underground for many years, 
and you're familiar with that type of work. We'll come back to what it is that you 
do underground. I like the statement you made about pipe and wire, and what 
it [00:07:30] is about pipe and wire mean to you, okay? Do you remember the 
first day when you started in the business? 
Absolutely. 
Can you tell me about it. 
Absolutely. My first day in the business my old man got me he bought me a big 
toolbox, big metal toolbox. I'd like to say it was a Craftsman's toolbox, but I'm 
not sure who it was. I think it was Sears. My old man was a big Sears' guy. When 
I grew up everything was Sears. Sears, Sears, Sears. 
How come? 
That's just what it was. He was a Sears' guy, you know, you had dungarees from 
Sears, you bought [00:08:00] your tools from Sears. That was like America, man. 
That's what he did he went to Sears, so he got me my toolbox, and he said, 
"Don't be late." That's all he ever said. "Don't fuck this up." You know, because I 
wasgoingto come in. I worked inthe maintenance division in DBM when I was 
18, and I left the Local because I didn't feel like doing maintenance. I really 
would have got in the A Division a little bit sooner, but they kind of showed me 
Page 3 of22 
that this is something, so they made [00:08:30] me wait until I was 21. They 
made me wait because instead of going over right away they said, "Listen, you 
left. Now are you sure you want to, you know, make sure you want to come 
back," and now I came back, so I was very excited. 
My buddy, Timmy, was there he worked a couple of weeks. Mac was already in. 
A couple of guys were in. I was excited, and I went down the street, walking 
down the street I'm looking around. I'm not a city guy, you know. I'm walking 
around feeling good, you know, I'm a little nervous, but I feel good, you know, I 
worked with [00:09:00] my hands my whole life, so I'm not like nervous about it, 
but I'm in there carrying this box. That was the worst thing just carrying a 
toolbox. It was the summer it was hot, and I'm looking for this guy, and I see this 
guy sitting there. 
I see Joe, Old Man Joe as they called him, great guy. My first mechanic all tatted 
up, you know, he's got the guinea T-shirt on, and he's got the cross hanging 
down, and he's got the tattoos all over him. His hair is in the back [00:09:30] 
slicked back. It was picture perfect. I went over to him and I said, "I'm looking 
for this address," and he goes, "That's us." That was it we shook hands, and he 
sent me upstairs. As a Local three guy you hear all these stories. "My buddy was 
working for guys, and they took him out to the bar they were taking him out it 
was the '80's," so my first day he said to me he goes, "Listen, kid, go upstairs, 
and there's going to be a couple of gangboxes. You throw your tools in the 
gangbox." 
[00:10:00] I didn't know what a gang box is, you know, I'm like "What's this guy 
talking about gang boxes." "The big box, steel box, you lift it open." He had a 
little bit of an attitude. I go upstairs. I go up there, there was like I think literally 
there was three or four gang boxes, so what do I do I open the gang box, and it's 
nothing but like beer. It's just beer and fucking coolers, and I was like, "Oh, shit," 
but that wasn't the electrician's toolbox. That was [00:10:30] the Sullivan 
Brothers, and that was the ironworkers. You don't mess with the ironworkers 
shit, but I didn't know that, so I was like, "Wow." It was a 7:30 stop back then, so 
what I did was I had a beer. 
I opened it up, I had a beer, and I sat by the window, and I said, "It's the greatest 
thing" because the other boxes were locked anyway. I checked them. They were 
all locked. I figured this is like the welcome party they were all my buddies, too, 
so that's what I did, so I had a beer, and I'm drinking, and I'm like, "Oh, this is 
the greatest thing." I waiting for them to come up the stairs, and I'm waiting, 
and I'm sitting by [00:11:00] the window. Then I finish one, I said, "You know 
what? I don't know, I'm going to have another one," so I went ahead and took 
another beer, and as I'm drinking that beer all of a sudden I hear Old Man Joe, 
"What the fuck are you doing?" 
I'm like, "Joe, thank you." He's like, "You idiot." He goes, "That's the 
ironworkers. They'll kill us." He goes, "Give me that thing." I didn't know what 
was going on at first, and it was funny. If I look back it's a little more funny, but 
Scott Pullman edit

Scott Pullman: 
back then [00:11:30] I'm like "What the fuck." The other boxes were locked, so 
they were locked, so I figured that was the only one that was open, so it was 
kind of like, you know. He's like "This is the boxes." "Well, you didn't give me the 
key. How am I supposed to get in there?" He got in there, and now he's like all 
angry at me. We go downstairs. This guy Mario is down there. Mario is looking 
at me just shaking his head at me, but he wasn't mad, a nd it was good. That was 
my first day, and this other guy Charlie was there. He was another apprentice. 
He was like a fourth year apprentice. That was my first [00:12:00] day in the 
business. That was like my first hour in the business. 
You drank two beers. 
A beer and a half. Joe took the other beer. He's like having a heart failure. I said, 
"Take it easy." Meanwhile, it's a guy that's got tattoos all over him, you know, 
he moves his forearm the girl moves in the glass, you know. He's got Elizabeth 
Taylor on his arm, and he spelled Elizabeth wrong. This is the kind of guy and 
you know he's mad at me. I'm like "All right, here we go," but absolutely a very, 
very good electrician knew his trade. [00:12:30] That was my first day. We got 
acclimated. Me and Joe, eventually, I was a good worker, so he liked that. It was 
just four of us we worked. It was an M shop. It was Arctic Electric, so it was kind 
of more a little hands-on. We do a lot of service work, and I was working, I 
would work, so he was like we went to another job. Where did we go? I think 
we went to the Pfizer building. 
All four of you together? 
No, me and Joe went there. We left Mario [00:13:00] and Charlie there because 
we worked for about a week, and then me and Joe still a little tension there 
after the week, but it's just a little tension, but we worked together. It was a 
little mutual respect, but still like, you know, I'm like "You're a jerk." He's like 
"You're a jerk," or whatever, and that's it, so now he's like "Kid, we got to go to 
42nd Street." Now I meet him there Monday. The box gets dropped off if I 
remember correctly. We dropped the box off. They dropped the box off Arctic. 
We go down there, so Old Man Joe has got [00:13:30] at this time this was his 
box, he had his own box. It was an M shop, whatever, so to have his own 
personal things. He said "The tools are there," and he's got like a couple of bags 
in the back, and he's got his scotch. He's got Dewar's White Label. 
Old Man Joe pours himself a drink out of the plastic cup, so I was like, you know, 
"What the fuck is that? Who the fuck am I ? I'm fucking Woody. Are we bonders 
or what?" He goes "Are you going to have a drink with me?" I said, "Yeah, I'll 
have a drink with you." We did two shots together. We did a shot, and then he 
was going to [00:14:00] do another one. "Yeah, I'll do whatever you think you 
can do big guy," and then fuck, and we did them together, a nd after that that 
was it. The bond was on and that was it. That was my early days, my early week 
in the business. Everybody was good. We all looked out for each other. It was 
nice. Joe always looked out for me, always talked to me, always treated me as 
an equal. Never less than, never condescending. If he did, sometimes, he

slipped, he always apologized. I knew it was never malicious so that was nice, 
[00:14:30] you know.

How long did you guys work together? 
We worked together for about I was at Arctic Electric for about a year and a 
half. I already asked for my rotation. They wanted to keep me I had to get out of 
there. 
As an apprentice? 
Yeah. 
How did you feel when you left? 
I felt good. I wanted to leave the M shop. I wanted to be in A shop. You got to 
remember back then this is in the '80's, you know, M guys weren't around. M 
guy was like the plague you know what I mean? As my boy [00:15:00] Ray said, 
he goes, "You were better off having AIDS than being an M guy." I mean, you 
know, it was like oh, man, he's an M guy that was bad news. You wanted to be 
in the A world, you know. I mean, literally that was like the worst thing that 
could happen to you. Fucking M guy, oh shit, you know. 
You spoke a little about doing some concrete work. 
Just so you know the M guy is the guy that doesn't go through the 
apprenticeship he came through the back door. 
Thank you for clarifying that. Back door meaning organize. 
Organize guy. 
Right. [00:15:30] Can you tell us a little more about your work as a concrete 
worker, and you said everything... 
No concrete was... 
One of your past jobs. 
Yeah, that was Kilkenny Construction. That was the crazy Irish, you know, loved 
the man to death, and may he rest in peace. Great guy, loved the family, loved 
Kilkenny's, great people, all the Kilkenny's, sisters, about everybody, but he was 
a guy that worked, and [00:16:00] he worked hard. I mean that's what they did. 
There was no break. You worked; you ate your lunch from fucking job to job. 
You broke up cement, you used a sledgehammer. You get a wheelbarrow and it 
was 100 degrees out, and you worked, you know, there was no, "I need a break. 
Page 6 of 22 
I think the heat's too high. Can I get another drink of water?" It wasn't like that. 
"Let's go, let's move." 
Jamie Lopez: 
Scott Pullman: 
Jamie Lopez: 
Scott Pullman: 
He used to put his ear down on the ground, and I used to look at him, and he's 
like, "Oh, my Jesus, Scotty, can you hear it? I can hear the trucks they're about 
five minutes away." He used to go "Can you hear?" He used to get so [00:16:30] 
excited, and I used to love that. I really enjoyed that. We worked hard. He liked 
me, I mean, I wasn't the best guy, but we worked hard, so he always respected 
that. That's what he always told me. He said, "You're always willing to work," so 
that was like key. 
Then I worked like panel trim. I did some kitchen work. I was the helper. That 
job was all right, you know what I mean? I like the fact that when you walked 
away like the concrete you saw a nice stoop, you saw some nice brickwork in 
this work, and I was the helper and everything. I was not the mechanic. You'd 
walk away from [00:17:00] a nice kitchen, or a nice, you know, something you 
walk away you can see it. That was like the service work you could put up some 
cabinets, put up some copper detail, but after you close everything up you don't 
see electrical work. 
You know, when you close it you don't see it, so for me it was always nice 
building something electric, you know, so you could see it not doing like the 
renovation, and you don't see it. You only see the outlet on the wall, the switch, 
or the lights on the ceiling, but yeah, it was nice. Everybody was close. Both 
shops I worked at everybody was close. Kilkenny's we were very close. 
[00:17:30] Old man Kilkenny used to say, "Jesus Christ, you go over there you 
have fucking potatoes everywhere." Potatoes in the sink you grab them. You 
could eat one raw and it would taste like an apple. That's what we'd do we kept 
them around, and what a great guy. I learned a lot. 
So that concrete work and that kind of work how did it help you transition into 
the electrical industry? What kind of influence did you do because I know as you 
were working hard, but did [00:18:00] those work ethics transpose? 
I think the work ethic was always it was just different you know what I mean 
because the M shop you had guys that came in from non-union places, so their 
work ethic wasn't really like the A worker work ethic, you know, so now you go 
in, and I'm working hard. They liked my work. They still worked. Work ethic was 
fine. The idea was for me the biggest thing was going from a union place to a 
non-union place [00:18:30] like realizing what Local three is what the union was. 
One less person. 
Yeah, you know what I mean, and when I didn't have, and when I did have, you 
know, once you don't have it you're like "Oh, wow," so it was just a great thing 
back then because Local three was strong, you know. My old man used to say 
"You could walk into a car dealership and you didn't have anything on you. You 
Scott Pullman edit 
Page 7 of22 
Jamie Lopez: 
Scott Pullman: 
Jamie Lopez: 
Scott Pullman: 
Jamie Lopez: 
had your Local three card you'd put it on the table, and the guy would say come 
on in Mr. Pullman," and that's all he did. That's all you needed was a Local three 
card that was it best job in the city, you know, that's what it was. [00:19:00] It 
was a lot of respect, so in that sense, and then the Union was just getting 
breaks. I was eating in the truck from job to job, and I thought that was fine 
because that's what I did, and I loved the guys, but it was nice to be able to, oh, 
we're going to have a break. Oh, we're going to go eat. We're going to come 
back. Oh, we actually get the chance to wash up, and then we can clean up, 
then we get time to clean up and go home, and then I could leave my tools on 
the job. 
I didn't have to bring them back and forth. I could pack it up. I don't have to buy 
any heavy duty tools, or power tools. [00:19:30] Everything is all taken care of, 
so in that aspect that was really nice, you know, that was like "Wow, this is local 
three." At that time Local three like I said, as I went on, as I noticed I would be in 
the city, and I would just go to lunch somewhere, or I'd eat at the Blarney Stone, 
or downtown at Cozzoli's coffee house when I got shipped downtown to 
another. I forget who I was working for we went down there, and I went down 
there, and everybody says, "Hey, you're a Local three apprentice," like they 
knew before I [00:20:00] had to say anything. That's how powerful it was. That's 
how crazy it was, you know, you walked around. 
How did they treat you as an apprentice? 
Oh, it was great. The Local three apprentice got treated great. I mean it was just 
like I said if you were in a hoist going up, and everybody dropped their card the 
first card they're looking for is that Local three card. All the other cards stay. 
Where's the A card? Give me the A card. It was the fitter's card, it was the 
laborer's card, it was the painter's card, it was the fucking concrete guys card, or 
the elevator guy. It was the Local [00:20:30] three card, and there was a sense 
of pride back then. It was great. Harry Van Arsdale was still around. The Local 
was probably only about I would say I think 6,500 members at that time so it 
was pretty small compared to where we are today. I think how many A guys are 
there now, 13,000 or something? 
Mm-hmm. 
I think, you know, it was just fine, but I'm saying back then it was a smaller 
group of guys, so everybody is closer. Everybody knew [00:21:00] somebody, 
who knew somebody, or who is this guy, you know. It was good because if you 
knew somebody, and they knew you knew somebody you worked twice as hard. 
You really didn't float on it because now, sometimes, guys like "Oh, you know 
who that guy knows leave him alone." No, back then, "Oh, you know that guy?" 
"Yeah, I'm going to work twice as hard now". 
All right. Can you explain a little bit some of the thought processes? 
Scott Pullman edit 
Page 8 of 22 
Scott Pullman: 
Jamie Lopez: 
Scott Pullman: 
That mentality was just different like you know right away, you know, "Oh, shit, 
you know Scotty's old man. He's over there I saw him in the other building." So 
all of a sudden, you know, "Oh, shit I'm going to [00:21:30] work twice as hard." 
That's what we did we stayed together, but now I don't know what happened. 
Now it's like it's just different. Sometimes a guy knows somebody, and all of a 
sudden he thinks he knows what I'm doing. 
It kind of bothers me a little bit, you know, "Who's that guy now, or what has he 
got?" "Oh, he knows someone. That's his brother over there?" "Oh, so what's 
his gig? He doesn't do anything now?" Because now the work falls on the other 
guy, and we always said, "The contractor has got to make some money." 
[00:22:00] If we don't make money we got a problem, so I don't know how that 
twisted, but it did twist it a little bit, so it is what it is. Hopefully, we could twist 
it back, you know. 
Scotty, can you tell me about the learning process at work your learning 
process? 
Well, my learning process is a little different. I think apprentices have it a lot 
harder today. When I came in Local three it was a two man trade, [00:22:30] all 
right? So when you went to work you always worked with another guy, and that 
was it. There was no, "Oh, you're doing three-quarter. Oh, you're doing one 
inch, you can do this by yourself. Now you're doing two-inch can you do it by 
yourself? Just get it on the rack." No-no. "Can you cut three, or can you get it all 
the way in?" You know, fuck that. It's just crazy shit right now, but back then 
when I came in it was a two man trade so it was great. 
I worked for a guy, and I remember like as an apprentice at Arctic Electric I 
worked it was me and Joe, or it was just us together working [00:23:00] 
together so it was the learning process I was hands-on I was right there, but 
when I got rotated I went to O'Kane Electric in my third year, and that was a job 
where ... Was that my second or my third? Whatever, Louie Joppa was running 
that job, so if we had 12 guys, and two apprentices, or maybe me just the only 
apprentice every week Louie would put me with two different guys. I would 
have to get the coffee and everything, but I would be able to get actually and lay 
back, a nd watch the way these two guys worked, a nd maybe we'd do the 
service. Then they go upstairs, and then maybe I would [00:23:30] do the 
lighting with two other guys. Maybe I bent pipe with somebody else, so it was 
really nice. 
Now, sometimes, they send apprentices on their own, you know, which is right 
away can you do this for me? Can you help me out? I think it's a great 
disadvantage that's why I'm very happy that the schooling has changed where 
these guys go to school for the week, and they actually work with guys, a nd they 
stay more together, and that comradery is there because when we went to 
school I could see a guy that I went through the apprenticeship, and I haven't 
seen him in 20 years all of a sudden we're like best friends. You know what I 
mean? So [00:24:00] it's just something where we just see each other, and 
Scott Pullman edit 
Page 9 of 22 
Jamie Lopez: 
Scott Pullman: 
we're just tight, and that's just the way it is. We have something. I like to see 
that they're back in the school where they have to learn, and they're together 
it's nice. 
Can you remember a time where you were scared of a certain tool, or a certain 
job location, or a certain type of task that you had to do? 
[00:24:30] I was scared of a certain task. I don't know if I was ever because 
when I started working in the subway the trains were a little dangerous, but 
when I first started I worked with a lot of guys that were already in the subway, 
and I knew these guys, and we actually started the South Ferry, so when you 
start at the South Ferry the South Ferry was getting redone everything was 
dead, so it was nice. I got to walk around, and [00:25:00] really see everything 
first, but to be really scared when was I ever? I don't know. I think one time at 
NJD Electric was further in my career they were hooking up the school alive they 
went to the end-line box, you know, it's something you shouldn't do, you aren't 
going to do, and my super asked me to do it. I just told him "I'm not going to do 
it that's all," and sure enough he had two other guys that did it, and I said, 
"That's fine. I'll stay by the door over here, and when you guys blow up I'll be 
over here." 
That [00:25:30] was something that was a little wacky. That was the only time I 
was actually scared for them because they were two decent guys. It was an M 
shop, too, so they came in through the back door, and I guess they wanted to 
show their value. They didn't want to leave the shop where I could leave and go 
I felt fine, but I knew the guy didn't want to lose me, but I was probably scared 
for them. I was like "Holy shit." These guys were dripping with sweat. They were 
putting the detail on, [00:26:00] and it was live, and one guy was putting the 
bolt through, and attaching the bolts I was like "F that. I'm not doing that, bro. 
I'll be over here. Do you guys need a drink or something? I'll be over here." 
I can't actually remember really being scared. I guess maybe up in a lift walking. 
I'm trying to think at Ravenswood when we walked around on top of that job we 
had to walk on to get to the other side. It probably wasn't the smartest thing. 
Back then we didn't have there wasn't all harnesses, there wasn't like crazy 
safety it is now, [00:26:30] you know, ironworkers, nobody wore harnesses. 
Now they all wear them, and I walked across the iron, and I get to the other side 
my buddy Richard is like "What are you crazy?" I did it because I enjoyed it, but I 
guess I don't know. I can't say I was really ever because if I really felt 
uncomfortable on something you know what? I didn't do it. I really didn't do it. I 
would get a couple of guys with me. 
I guess at Amtrak we were on top of this the trains were underneath us, so they 
built this shield like [00:27:00] this metal shield that you worked on top of, and 
you were closed in there, but it was kind of a wacky area, you know. We always 
preached safety. The stewards there safety, safety, safety, open the ladder, this, 
that, but when you got to work in an area, especially, in the subways it's not 
always the case, so you got to work, but live track it always gets me a little

nervous sometimes. Live track you got to be careful where you put your feet. If 
you have a long day you don't want to trip or fall [00:27:30] or something, but 
that's it really. I got to honestly say that's really it. 
Scott, you spoke about pipe and wire. Is it safe to say that that's some of the 
work that you feel most comfortable doing? 
Yeah, that's pretty much what we did. I mean when I came in the saying was 
"What are you doing today? Pipe and wire?" That's what we did, you know, but 
now today's world is a little different. Now you have the fiber. Also, you have all 
this data. Each lighting system is specialized. [00:28:00] Now we got into the 
subway, but the subway it's pretty much we're pulling wire whether it's for the 
relay rooms, and they're number nines, or they're two mils, or they're number 
12's, and they're 500,000's. That's what we do. We run pipe and we pull wire. 
It's electrical work that's what it is. 
Scott, can you tell us about the action of pulling wire, and what has been for you 
the things you've learned, and how does that happen? 
I love to pull wire because pulling [00:28:30] wire became this thing where the 
guys get paid, so if you get the wire pulled everybody is happy, you know. The 
poor guy running the pipe breaking his ass is getting no accolades he's doing all 
the work, and then you get a guy with a couple of reels of 500,000's. We did 
that at the Bloomberg Building I think that was on the west side highway. It was 
over there somewhere. I don't know I'm trying to remember. That's all we did 
me and my partner we pulled wire. [00:29:00] They had a problem we were 
runningthe pipe upstairs. "Pullingwire is nothing, blah, blah, blah." 
They lost a couple of noses of 500's because everybody wants a shortcut, so you 
put the basket on. You got to tie wire the basket. You could put a little jacket on 
and a zipper. Use the soap. Another thing what guys do, especially, guys for 
some reason guys that come through the back door they don't like using soap. 
It's just like they don't want to get dirty. It's just pullingwire in buckets of soap 
for me that's what it is, and you use a lot of soap, [00:29:30] and after it's done, 
and it's pulled everybody is so happy because now the contractor is going to put 
in for a payment I guess, and it's like you become the hero on the job, and it was 
a great thing. 
Scott, I want to make sure that when people listen to this they may not know 
what losing the nose is. 
Well, losing the wire, you know, so now the wire you're pulling wire, so what 
you have to do is you pull a small rope through this pipe if you're pulling like 
four-inch pipe, and you're pulling [00:30:00] 500,000's that would be the 
feeders, so what you do is you have these big reels that go way up to 2,000 
pounds on one end of this I don't know it's like a 500 foot run, 400 foot run, 
whatever it is. There's some 90's, there's some bands, there's maybe going 
Scott Pullman edit 
Page 11 of 22 
Jamie Lopez: 
Scott Pullman: 
down there's a riser, and every fifth floor there's maybe a box that you got to 
pull through. You want to put soap there. The guy is going to soap. 
Communication is the biggest thing, but when you're pulling wire, and there's a 
guy in a tugging machine that's pulling this thing, and you're [00:30:30] feeding 
it, and if it gets jammed somewhere, or it's not going in there's not much soap, 
and a lot of friction, a lot of resistance, and all of a sudden that basket comes off 
because it wasn't tie wired properly then what happens? You've lost it. You pull 
that thing, and I know when I get the wire out of there if it was going down, or if 
it was going across, you know, it's just a big headache. Here's a job that really 
was a nice job became a mess because the guy wanted to cut a couple of 
corners, you know, or didn't know what he was doing, [00:31:00] and he didn't 
want to speak up and say "I didn't know what I was doing," or the foreman who 
was there should have really checked the nose a couple of times, and let these 
guys run instead of doing whatever else he was doing, you know, the priorities 
were set wrong. 
So what I would do is, you know, they go up to the elder guy, you know, the 
veteran guy, or not even that, but me and Eric were good. We had a little bit of 
a reputation there. We're doing a little pipe. "Scotty, can you do me a favor?" 
Mikey said, Mikey Rizer, "Can you do us a favor. Can you take care of the 
noses?"" [00:31:30] Sure no problem." There was no problem, and then we 
would do it. I asked for more soap. They're like "Do you really it? Do you need 
this? Do you need more tie wire?" I'm like, "Yes, this is what we need. If you 
want me to do it I'll do it, but it's got to be my way. I ain't putting my name on it. 
Don't tell me how to do it, and have me do it because you don't need me then. 
I'll do something else. I'll do the pipe." 
That's something that I was very strong on. If you want me to do something 
then you know what? We're going to discuss it, and then we're going to figure it 
out together, and then we're going to [00:32:00] do it, and that's just what I did. 
The pulls went good. The pulls started going good. We got walkie-talkies for 
everybody. We only had two between the puller and me. All of a sudden there's 
guys in the shafts they want to pull it's going down. You know what? They need 
to know. I need to know where they are, and make sure the wire went through 
the pull box, you know, the pencil boxes. They have to know, and it was like 
"Oh, we'll hear them." "No-no, we're not going to hear them. We're not sticking 
our head in the box. We're not doing any of that crazy shit. Not putting your 
hands in there. We're not doing it. Get me walkie- [00:32:30] talkies, or have 
somebody else do it." 
You got them? 
We got them. You always get them, and you know why? Because there were so 
many pulls I mean there had to be at least 40 pulls, or something, and literally 
probably 30 had to be at least 30, and why not? Most contractors don't care 
they really don't care. They give you whatever you need. You just got to ask.

Scotty, this communication you're talking about. What is some of the 
commands, or some of the words that you use when you're pulling wire? 
[00:33:00] Stop the pull. You know, there's a guy on the radio, so I always do a 
little testing to the catcher, you know, "Testing, one, two, three. Joe, do you 
hear me? Where are you? We're making the nose now? How's the machine? Did 
you set the machine up? Pull the rope in." We got to pull the rope because we 
have a drag. You have a small rope then you pull the heavier rope in, so we pull 
the rope in, it's good. We set up a pulley, a couple of pulleys, a couple of wheels, 
so when a wire comes out if it's up above you want the least [00:33:30] friction 
as possible. It was just something that was good, so pulling the wire for me it 
was either stop the pull. For me there's no talking on the radio. When that pull 
goes "Ready? We're ready to pull wire. Everybody ready?" "Good." 
You have a couple of guys by the reels. They got to feed the wire in because you 
don't want them to pull it right off. You want less stress on that machine so we 
got the guys in position. We're feeding. We have the soap is in position. 
"Everybody is in position?" Nobody talks now to get going. The only thing I want 
to hear is [00:34:00] if there's a problem I'll say, "Stop the pull," or you know it's 
coming through this pencil box I know where it is. I'm putting more soap there 
for the other guy pulling it through the stairs, and at the end we got it we're 
good. "Let's do another one," and that's it. 
Very cool. Scott, have you ever passed a tool down to somebody, or have a tool 
passed down to you? 
[00:34:30] Say that again. 
Have you ever passed a tool down to somebody, or have a tool passed to you? 
Of course. 
Like somebody gave you a tool, or you gave somebody a tool? 
Of course. 
Which tool do you remember? 
What do you mean? Maybe I don't understand, I mean it's just always, oh, you 
mean like for keeps like from a friend or a father? 
Yeah. 
I thought you meant work. [00:35:00] I think back in the day Old Man Joe he 
gave me tools. He gave me like a Star Drill the Starbit, you know. I don't have it 
anymore. I think I left it on the train. 
Page 13 of 22 
Jamie Lopez:

Jamie Lopez: 
Scott Pullman: 
What's a Stardrill? 
It's like instead of using a drill with like power you put this thing on the wall, and 
you bang it with a hammer and you turn it. It's like a pick. It's got like a fine bit, 
almost like I guess like a Phillips screwdriver, but it's steel, [00:35:30] and you 
hold it, and you bang it, and you make a hole by hand, so you turn it, you turn it, 
you turn it, then you put the fastener it there, and then you screw into the wall, 
so those days are gone. I threw it away. Joe gave it to me. I said, "We're not 
using this anymore, Joe. We're getting tools," but he loved it because we never 
used power, and he was an old-time guy, and strong guy, really strong guy. We 
had a great time. Then you know what? I still have, and I still love from the old 
days [00:36:00] on the pliers used to have the red grips. 
What do you mean? 
The grips, so the insulators. On the pliers they come with grips. I mean you buy 
a pair of Klein pliers they're blue, and now they have all different kinds. People 
buy all different kinds, but back in the '80's when I came in the old man used to 
buy these grips, and you slip them on your hand when you take the other ones 
off, and they were thicker, and they were heavier, but those were just cool. 
Those were the cool ones. 
So you were happy. 
[00:36:30] You were happy that was it. Old Man Joe gave me that, and that's 
pretty much that was the extent, you know, but Joe would give me any tool I 
wanted, you know, he didn't care. Gave me anything I wanted. He was a great 
guy. May he rest in peace. 
That is some sort of tradition that we do have when we hand tools, or we give 
tools. Are there any other traditions that you could think of that are some of 
your favorite traditions in Local three? 
My favorite tradition in Local three. Well, the best thing to do is really to hand 
off their knowledge. I mean that's [00:37:00] the best thing. That's what we're 
supposed to do. We're supposed to hand the knowledge off, so when you do 
work, and you're working in a box, and we put tape around the receptacle we 
don't do it because you have to. It's not code. We do it because the next guy in 
is going to be a Local three electrician, so he doesn't get banged up. You always 
want to do the job looking good. I mean that's really one of the best I mean 
when I came in quality work was really something that was important. It was 
really important. I mean it's still important. Don't get me wrong, but obviously 
quality for some reason takes a little bit longer than the quantity. [00:37:30] Not 
always because sometimes the quantity goes up, and it's garbage and it comes 
right out, so I really believe that the quality really has to be there, but it takes 
more time to do it. 
Scott Pullman edit

Local three as Old Man Joe he told me something that I still use to this day and 
he told me we were working on a job. Quick story, we're working on a job, so 
this is when now me and Joe are good. We did the shot of scotch if you 
remember. We did the shot of scotch each, a couple of shots of scotch me and 
Joe are forming [00:38:00] this bond, and now he likes me a lot. Now we got 
each other's back. He's got my back we're good. We're on the job for about 
three months, four months. There were other guys from our company there, 
too, but Joe is the kind of guy that's got his own little slice, so we got our own 
little slice in there, and it was nice for me, too, because I only had to listen to 
Joe. There was no general for the other foremen. I kind of just listened to Joe, so 
there was a little animosity. 
Also, we got to the job and another contractor I forget who it was another 
electrical contractor was [00:38:30] there, and another apprentice was running 
around, and me and Old Man Joe used to leave everything open. The boxes 
were always open. You never stole anybody's tools. If you were going to steal 
something you would steal maybe a contractor's tools, but you never stole a 
guys personal tools, never. No matter what the trade was. All of a sudden this 
guy is like "You got to lock the box. You got to lock this up." I'll never forget I'm 
like "Joe, you know, maybe we should lock stuff up." He goes "Why? What are 
you talking about?" I said, "The guy keeps telling me the other job it was 
stolen." 
He [00:39:00] goes "Watch that kid. If he's worried about stealing everything." 
He goes, "Listen, Scotty, I'm going to tell you something right now." He told me 
he said, "It's a thief that worries about stealing," and that's something that I've 
used for my whole life, and sure enough the kid was a thief. I'll never forget 
that, and that's with anything. That's when you work for a guy, and it's a real 
fucking hard-on, and I worked for a guy like the guy Greg I had a little bit of a 
problem at the relay room that we just came from. I know the guy, one of the 
worst workers [00:39:30] I've ever seen. He's a sloth. He just takes forever to do 
anything. He's a good mechanic, but it just takes him forever. I mean 
unnecessarily. 
I always said, "He thinks that when he's at work that everybody is fucking him." 
You know why? Because it's a thief that worries about stealing. Since he always 
fucked the guy he thinks everybody is fucking him, and that's the problem. That 
saying is the best, so the tradition is really how tight we get with each other. The 
tradition is really that we do look out for each other. The comradery on the job 
is really [00:40:00] good. I like that when you're on the job, and another Local 
three contractor comes in, and maybe you know him, maybe you don't know 
him, but if he needs something you always take care of that guy. Always take 
care of him. That's a great tradition, you know, but we're always like that. 
Jamie Lopez: Beautiful. You speak about transition and changes and how the way things used 
to be is there anything about the industry that you like [00:40:30] or dislike in 
this change? 
Scott Pullman edit 
Page 15 of 22 
Scott Pullman: 
First of all change has to happen. That's that. I mean it does happen. I 
remember when I was an apprentice, and we would try to fight the change. 
They had the Yankee screwdriver, so if you push them they spin real quick. I 
remember Teddy [inaudible 00:40:55] he was a crazy steward. All the stewards 
back then they were [00:41:00] all forces, you know, great guys, a lot of stories 
just really stand-up guys. He used to have me going around, he'd be like "Kid, I 
want you to go around and take any Yankee screwdriver. You see somebody 
using a Yankee screwdriver take it away from them because we're going to 
screw it in by hand. We don't use them screwdrivers." We didn't have screw 
tips, we didn't have the battery guns, we didn't have any of that. Eventually, 
now we have the guns, and now I know how to use it. You have to change, but 
that was back then. 
Change is good. [00:41:30] Change is something that has to happen. I feel like 
because there was only 6,500, maybe 7,000, 8,000 guys, now there's almost 
13,000 the change in society is that people need more money to live. Life is 
tough right now. I mean both people work all the time. My wife works, you 
know, you have to work. It's expensive, so what happens is people years ago if 
you left your job [00:42:00] there was another job waiting for you. Local three I 
know you went down to the Union hall, and there you are. "Go here now, go 
here, go here." "I'm not working." "All right." "I'm going to get my money. I'm 
going to move on. The job is up." "Do you want to stay with the company?" "No, 
actually, I'm leaving, bro." You go down to the hall. "Great, it's great to see you." 
You go downstairs, you have a couple, you see guys, you go down you got 
another job. That was the best part about Local three just going all over the city. 
For me I loved that. Now you get laid off. [00:42:30] I actually just got my money 
the other day Friday the day before Memorial Day, and you know it's a five 
month wait, so that change is tough because out there right now I mean, 
obviously, we have twice as many guys working, which we still have a 
tremendous amount of guys working, but there's a lot of construction going on, 
and we have a five month wait, so that's a big change, so guys don't want to get 
laid off that quick. If you're a younger guy, and you got a mortgage, and you're 
35 years old, and your wife is maybe [00:43:00] having a tough time she's not 
making great money, you know, and the guy says, "Listen, I want you to run up 
there and get this done." 
You may say, "You know what? I don't want to get laid off, man. I don't want to 
be off five months." You may run up there and do something that you really 
wouldn't do, you know, so that change I would like to see go back, you know. I'd 
like to see like the front office I guess I don't know somehow more contact with 
the jobs, but I did see when I was at the Hub, which was nice Johnny Baker came 
down to the job [00:43:30] a couple of times, which was really nice. That was 
just nice to see guys like that. The reaction from the guys was like "Oh, one of 
the business reps is here." John's an approachable guy, so it was no big deal 
whether you knew him, or you didn't know him he was a very nice guy, you 
know, very approachable, so that was good. Guys want to feel that. They want 
to feel the Local. That was a bigthing. 
Scott Pullman edit 
Page 16 of 22 
You go to some jobs where the steward is not really prevalent, and there's some 
jobs that you go to, and the steward is there all the time that's nice. That's what 
we need to see, you know. [00:44:00] The change is tough. The work picture is 
tough. You go through the city now, and there's a lot of work going on, but we 
have a lot of guys still working. When you think about it we still got 10,000 guys 
working I mean that's a tremendous amount of guys working, so I don't know. 
As far as change I would like to see more, but it's always been that way I guess, 
you know, the 10% rule where you see the same guys at the rallies. You see the 
same guys. 
I'm not an overly active guy. I'm [00:44:30] active, but I'm not overly active, but 
there are guys that give everything in their family life, and everything. God bless 
them, and there's guys maybe like me that really believe in the Union so strong 
because I know thank God I'm in Local three. Thank God I'm in Local three 
because I wouldn't have a 401(k). I have friends that don't work Union. They 
don't have anything. That would be me. I would have nothing. Now I have a 
pension. I have a 401(k). I got something for my kids going [00:45:00] to college. 
The Union is paying giving me money for that a scholarship. It's incredible. Local 
three is by far unbelievable. 
The changes I'd like to see is, you know, see the young guys on the job start to 
take a little more interest. I see guys on my job we had that rally at Spectrum, 
man. I saw guys, and I'm like "You going?" Oh, here comes the steward. I'm like 
"You don't have to tell me to go. I'm going to go." I don't need to sign a piece of 
... I'm going to the rally. [00:45:30] We need to go to the rally, that's what we 
need to do. They're attacking our medical benefits. They're attacking our 
benefits, and we're not going to go, and there's guys now "I'm going to go 
home." If we had 10,000 people down that block that's incredible. That's 
tremendous. Years ago when we had the ABC contractors we walked down that 
street. I got to tell you we walked down 42nd we were in the middle of the 
street we closed everybody down. 
We were running into non-union buildings throwing people out. [00:46:00] They 
were out running their cars, and if they left we left them alone. If they didn't 
leave whatever happens happens. You know what I mean? What are you going 
to do? Tough break, you know, so that was just a different time. That was crazy. 
That was probably in the '90's and everybody was there, you know, cops how 
they come on their horses. I mean it was just a crazy time because we were 
there, and we were willingto give it up, you know, everybody came down. It 
wasn't if there was 8,000 or 10,000 people, you know, there was 3,000, 4,000 
thousand people there, [00:46:30] but I'd like to see the numbers come up. I'd 
like to see people realize what they have because for some reason there are 
guys and you talk to them in this business they think they got everything 
because they're smart. Of course, they're really good electricians. 
Well, that mea ns nothing. It means nothing. The only reason I have anything is 
because of the Van Arsdale's and Harry, and we have Local three. That's it, now 
Chris, I mean really. I mean but I think somehow we got to get people to feel it

more, so if we had more time, or more I don't want [00:47:00] to say Chris, but 
maybe a couple of business reps some of them came down, or came down to 
the jobs once in a while these big prolific jobs, and said, "Hello," and say, "Hey, 
what's going on?" I think that the younger guys would feel like "Wow, that's 
great" because they have that mentor program, which is great, and they have all 
these things. You know I always felt like I was a mentor anyway. I always stayed 
in touch with people. I really didn't think that was something that I had to do, 
but it's a great thing. It's great innovation, so that's it it's really, really good. I 
[00:47:30] don't know where I'm going. 
In the future do you think that your children, or members of your community 
are going to do the same type of work? 
Listen, in my future I already have my friend Jerry and Timmy his son is in the 
Local he's an apprentice. I have another friend trying to get his son in the 
business. I have one son going to school now, and he's going to do the college 
helper thing next year. He didn't want to do it this year on account of him 
getting internships, and I have another [00:48:00] guy that he'll definitely do to 
that college help, or maybe come in I don't know when he's younger, you know, 
because he did great. I look around I got a great thing going on, you know, 
absolutely. I hope the Unions stay strong, you know. 
What advice would you give someone starting in your field or job? 
My advice would be to keep your eyes open, and try to keep your mouth closed. 
I mean that would be my advice. I'm not a good, you know, I like to talk, and I 
like to tell people things, but [00:48:30] if I had to do it all over again that would 
be my thing. I would learn as much as I could. If you're with a decent size 
company I'd probably try to stay there, and not look to leave right away. I would 
join a club or two, maybe at least one club, and get close to that club because 
I'm a guy that joins clubs, and I go there for a while. I make a cameo. I come 
back. I go for a while, and then I come back. I never really hook myself in. 
When I see guys now that I'm 50 some years old they're like when I started 
[00:49:00] before these guys now these guys have nice positions they're doing 
the right thing, and believe me they give up a lot of time, too, don't 
misunderstand what I'm saying, but I'm like "Wow, if I would have put a little 
more time in that could have helped me a little more," you know, and really the 
only thing was if I would have just ran some work because I work for guys now 
that sometimes it's just unbelievable, but I wish, you know, I didn't step up, or I 
didn't get that chance, you know. I did run work. I did have a couple of jobs as 
you know we had that job. That was a good job. That was a good time, and the 
steward we had [00:49:30] I mean he was good, and that was a good job. That 
worked out good. That was a lot of fun. 
Yes, can you tell us a little about that job that you ran with Stenco?

Yeah, I was one of the foremen. I didn't run the job. I was the general foreman, 
but we had a good job. Jamie Lopez, was that your first? 
I think it was my second shop. It was my first year. 
Yeah, second shop, first year, great apprentice. Always willing [00:50:00] to 
learn. Always willing, always excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent. 
Scott, before you go further I remember you used to come on the floor when 
we used to finish for the day, and with your finger you spin your finger and you 
would say, "Wrap it up." 
Wrap it up, and that was it. I love sayingthat. Like I said that with my kids when 
they little on the field "Wrap it up, let's go" because you know what happened? 
I miss that because years ago when we came here years ago the foreman was 
the last guy to leave the job. He was at the job the last guy to leave [00:50:30] 
the job. Now a lot of times I come up to work, and he's gone. Where the fuck is 
the foreman? He's gone, you know, and no fault I'm not bad or good, but for me 
that was something that was big. If I walk up from a hole, and I see the trail, and 
the foreman is gone, you know, he was the last guy there. 
You don't have to do nothing. He's going to plan. You don't have to physically do 
anything, but he was usually the last guy there unless you want somebody to 
get away I get it. You know what I mean? But that was a big thing, so I loved 
going [00:51:00] to the floor letting the guys know that I was there. Let's wrap it 
up. Let's get out of here together. Everybody goes together, and that was 
important to me, and I loved doing that. Like I said I love the Local, but that was 
the point that we all got on the same page, you know, that was an important 
thing. 
I remember that like I feel the same way like when we come into the work even 
though we come in separately we should all leave together. 
Oh, absolutely. That's something that I miss. On this job I can't tell you. 
[00:51:30] The South Ferry when I worked the day time the shift was small. I 
come upstairs there's nobody around everything is locked I'm like "What the 
fuck is going on here? Where's my foreman?" Thank God I didn't get hurt, or 
something is going on, or I wanted to talk to him about something, you know, 
and how can that guy actually ask me what time did you leave? What he's 
saying? I'm like the guy that leaves are you kidding me? Who's this guy? Right 
away my respect for that guy goes right out the window. It's a tough situation, 
and the job suffers because there's no doubt if you don't have [00:52:00] any 
kind of supervision around, or he doesn't do all these walks through, and see 
what's going on the job pays a price. I don't care what anybody says. The job 
pays a price. 
Do you feel electricians are underpaid, fairly paid, or overpaid?

Jamie Lopez: 
Scott Pullman: 
Never overpaid. Always underpaid, but I think we're fairly paid, and I think we 
make a good living. Never overpaid. I really believe that. We're never overpaid 
because like I said [00:52:30] you go to that spectrum, and that guy upstairs is 
making 99 million, and he don't want to pay out benefits. 99 million and you 
don't want to payout benefits for whatever guys you got 40 guys. Is he kidding 
me? He can make 90 million, and give everybody a raise, you know, so I never 
think we're overpaid, never, ever. I think we're fairly paid. I think our business 
guys our business manager I think everybody does the right thing. I think they 
progress. [00:53:00] I think we do what we have to do at the time. I think that 
he's pretty smart with that stuff. I think he really knows what's going on, and he 
gets what he can. 
With negotiations, right? 
Yeah. 
I only have one more question for you. What inspires you? 
What inspires me? A guy like you inspires me. You know, a young guy that 
comes in, and really has some kind of thought process, and thinks about things, 
and thinks about people. [00:53:30] Takes a different view take maybe a 
different look altogether. When I see other young guys on the job when I see 
like I saw this guy Ronnie Wersch. You know Ronnie? Another young guy, 
steward. Another very intelligent guy, you know, he could think, and you think 
he does care about the Local, and when you see people that actually care that's 
what inspires me. I saw this other guy Ryan a great mechanic he's like in his 30's 
tremendous mechanic. 
It inspires [00:54:00] me when I see the job get done, and it's nice, and I can 
look down, and I turn around, and I like work with a bunch of guys, and you 
know, "Wow, look how good this looks, you know, this looks nice, man." Fill in 
the dirt now, or whatever, look at the rock, you know, it came out really nice 
that inspires me. That's really cool, or we could all after work go out to a bar and 
hang out and laugh and you know we talk to each other that's nice, or you do a 
collection for a guy that's maybe having a baby, or somebody doesn't feel well, 
somebody got hurt that's nice when [00:54:30] you could do something for 
somebody. That's inspiring. That's what the Local is all about. 
For me it's not really the work. I could work in a pit. I could work in a beautiful 
place. If I'm with good guys it's all good. Good people. Good people are good 
people. If I work in a really nice place, and the guy is an asshole, and the other 
guy is I don't work there. I'd rather work in a hole with just good people. That's 
what the Unionism is all about the comradery that we all got each other's back, 
and I think it's still there, but like I said it's a little bit harder [00:55:00] now. The 
money is harder. The work time there's a lot more guys in the Local. There's no 
doubt we're up against things that we haven't been up against, so it's a little 
different, but I definitely think it's there, though.

Is there anything else that you want to add or you want to ask me or? 
What do I want to ask you? How did you get started with this? I mea n for me 
when we went to class Jamie Lopez is the [inaudible 00:55:28] He certainly 
knows that, so [00:55:30] we did it we went to class we went for our college 
education. Why I went I'm not too sure. I still got one more class to do, and I will 
do it, but it was good. It was good for my kids to see it, and I wanted to get it. I 
just wanted to have it, you know, and I wanted them to see that it was 
important, and Jamie Lopez was a young a guy that we worked together, right? 
On his second job, and now he's going for this education, and that's what the 
Local needs. The Local needs [00:56:00] guys that think, so I was very inspired 
by that. I always love to see you, and I love to see that part of the business. 
Right because we've worked together over a decade ago at that job in Stenco, 
and then we reunited again working at the United Nations about five years ago 
now, and then we met together one more time at school taking classes together 
for our Bachelors. 
It's a small world, and it's a smaller [00:56:30] Local. 
Once I left that job I thought we weren't going to see each other, you know, but 
then I did have the luck of meeting you again, and being able to reconnect with 
you. 
You're always going to be. For me that was the best part about the Local issues. 
That's why for me leaving a contractor you don't want to work when you leave a 
contractor, I mean, obviously it would be a little bit hard I guess you get put in 
place if you're inactive I don't know whatever the case is, but for me that's 
meeting every job. [00:57:00] Going to different people I love that. I love going 
to the city, and working downtown, and then you work in midtown, then you 
see this other guy. Then you don't see him for five or six years you see him 
again, and then you don't see him for 15 years like yesterday at the Sportsman 
my Italiano comes up to me Anthony he's like "Bro, how you've been?" He goes 
"You remember?" He goes "You were my mechanic. I was your apprentice." 
Then I'm remembering because I worked with him over at the UN, and I'm like 
trying to remember when that job [00:57:30] was, and I think it was for Forrest 
those were crazy days. I'm trying to remember which job that was, and we still 
to this day we hook up. Yesterday the other day I was over at East Side Access, 
and my buddy Stevie, you know, Stevie we were apprentices together, and we 
didn't work together it's got to be 30 years whatever it is, you know, 28, 30 
something, and we seen each other. We just laughed. We hooked up right away, 
you know, "How you doing? How's [00:58:00] your daughter? What's going on?" 
That's the best part about it. That's the best part about the Local that you 
actually see a guy, and you grab him.

I would love to see in the Local when I see guys what I would love to see is like 
years ago if you saw a guy working, and you were a young guy, and you were 
working, even older guy whatever it was, and a guy needed a hand you just gave 
him a hand. Now, sometimes, when I'm carrying something a guy walks by I got 
to whistle and yell. "Do me a favor. Get the fuck on the other end of this." You 
know what I mean? What are you kidding me? " [00:58:30] I'm not doing it I'm 
doing something else." I get you're not doing it, but you got to carry this fucking 
thing because we're walking down this way anyway. 
Jamie Lopez: Right. 
Scott Pullman: To me I want to get that mentality back. For some reason I feel like it's left a 
little bit, but it will come back, you know, I always have faith I really do I have a 
lot of faith. Of course, guys like you that's why I have faith, and Ronnie, and 
other guys I see. Those guys a re good guys. We have a lot to give, a lot to offer. 
[00:59:00] That's really what it's all about. Thank God for the Local. Thank God 
for Local three. 
How did we do?
