How did you get the job that you get as you talk about taking care of children? 
How did you come into that job? Walk me through that. How did you come to 
be this babysitter or domestic worker? 
Darlene Flores: 
Well, when I first came to America there was no documentation ... You had to 
get some documentation in order to have like [00:01:30] a real job. So I decided, 
since I like kids I'm going to go into the babysitting field, and that's what I did. 
Christine Lewis: 
You weren't recommended or no agencies. I know some people, you know, go 
to agencies, some people were recommended. Were you recommended by 
anybody to this job that you got? Were you recommended by somebody? How 
you come to do the job there? 
Darlene Flores: 
This my last job or my first job? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, no, your first [00:02:00] job. 
Darlene Flores:

first job that you got.

Yes, I got it from a friend of mines who worked for actually, her boss, had two 
kids that was adopted and she told me that they wanted to have someone to 
take care of the kids.

Speaker 2: 
Yeah, you had like, you've been a babysitter [00:03:00] and a live-in. Maybe 
before you answer that question she asked, just talk about the different types of 
jobs, because as I'm learning there is many ... We talked about it. There is many 
different- 
Christine Lewis: 
That's right.  
Speaker 2: 
-jobs- 
Christine Lewis: 
Layers.  
Speaker 2: 
-so just talk about the different types of those six jobs you've had. 
Darlene Flores: 
Right, yeah well I had different requirements on my job. I had mostly like well, 
we all know like living in you did a little extra, taking care of the house, but then 
[00:03:30] there was also jobs that I did were also required ... They had their 
own housekeeper and stuff, but once I'm living in I did extra work housekeeping 
and babysitting. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. All right, and nothing extra, you know. I write something that talk about 
women and landscapers, women ... 
Darlene Flores: 
Oh, no, no. Nothing with the outdoors, just indoors. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, because I filled it all, right? 
Darlene Flores: 
Okay. No, no landscaping. 
Christine Lewis: 
There's [00:04:00] a next story here. 
Darlene Flores: 
No landscaping. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yep, yep, yep. Painter. 
Darlene Flores: 
I do my own landscaping at my house. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. Walk me through a daily routine. What you do on the job. Give me a little, 
as we say in Trinidad, a ball-by-ball commentary.

school, there's some that I take, go to school, some that [00:04:30] I stay at 
home with, all depends on their ages. Just working hard to make my job better, 
you know, and taking good care of the kids, to make sure they have better life, 
too. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, so you stay at home with the kids. Tell me some of the things that you 
would do with the kids when you stay home with the kids. 
Domestic Workers United

Darlene Flores: 
Play with, you know, just have fun with them. Things that they like. I work 
through to see what they enjoy and whatever they like because different kids- 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:05:00] You ever do the parks? 
Darlene Flores: 
The what? 
Christine Lewis: 
The parks. 
Darlene Flores: 
Packs? 
Christine Lewis: 
Park. Park. 
Darlene Flores: 
Oh, to go to the parks? Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
Bookstores and all of that. 
Darlene Flores: 
The swings, sometimes Barnes and Nobles. If there's like libraries or stuff 
around, I'll go read. Give them their baths, put them to sleep. You know, the 
basics. Basics as a mother. A replacement as a mother. 
Christine Lewis: 
What skills do you need as a domestic worker? 
Darlene Flores: 
Well, you need to be respectful. You need to be- 
Christine Lewis: 
Is that a skill though? [00:05:30] Let me stop you. Is that a skill, being respectful 
as opposed to something? A skill is ... 
Darlene Flores: 
[inaudible 00:05:37] 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. I mean, it's good. We're having a conversation, so it's all right.  
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
A skill, is that- 
Darlene Flores: 
You mean with the baby? 
Christine Lewis: 
Well, it depends on you as a domestic worker because a domestic worker is 
somebody who works in the home, right? As you say, elder care giver, 
housekeeper, house cleaner. Is there a skill that you have to come [00:06:00] 
with? 
Darlene Flores: 
The most important thing is to be safe, I should say. Is safe a better answer? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, if you're comfortable with that. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
4
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah. I mean, you have to be- 
Speaker 2: 
Patience is good, too. 
Christine Lewis: 
Patience. 
Darlene Flores: 
Patience is very good, yeah. 
Speaker 2: 
I mean, talk about safety, but I think what I'm learning the patience thing is 
important, too, because not a lot of people have patience. 
Darlene Flores: 
That is a very good thing. Right. 
Speaker 2: 
We'll talk about safety. Go ahead. Sorry. 
Darlene Flores: 
No, no, no, no. You have a good point there. 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:06:30] Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Darlene Flores: 
Which is very ... because we need a lot of that anyway. 
Christine Lewis: 
Of course. 
Darlene Flores: 
I'm sure I've done 10% patience. 
Christine Lewis: 
So what training is necessary to be a domestic worker? Is there training? Is there 
something that you have to do or learn to become a domestic worker? 
Darlene Flores: 
Not really because it's just like having a kid. You have to learn your kid and you 
have to be, as I say, patience and safety. Basically it's like, I think it's the two 
most top, you know, to be [00:07:00] safe, make sure the kids are safe, and 
have a lot of patience, so that you don't snap and have to go off track. 
Christine Lewis: 
When I say that, you know, we grew up with mothers who we saw do things in a 
certain way, and kind of working in a home you sort of bring a skill. You know, 
you see the way your mother might cook- 
Darlene Flores: 
From [my ancestors 00:07:23], yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
You could pull something from that to say well, you know, the way that you 
would work with this family [00:07:30] that you worked with. What does that 
thing that you bring that is sort of in the genes of you, your family, you're right? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
5
Darlene Flores: 
Well, right, with ancestors we- 
Christine Lewis: 
Culturally. 
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, of course everyone has their own culture, but we learn, you know, like 
manners, which is important, and patience again. You know, safety, hygiene. 
There is a lot of combination which will bring like a good healthy home and 
happy home, which is very important for the home to be happy, so [00:08:00] 
yeah. It's all depend on how you, you know, patience have a lot to do with it, 
too, as you say, because it's going to respond on your attitude and stuff. How 
you control everything else. 
Christine Lewis: 
Is there some [speciality 00:08:17] or expertise that you bring to the job? That 
you have? Anything that you like or you have a tendency to. 
Darlene Flores: 
I think basically when you're going to a job you have to [00:08:30] be as if that's 
your home. You know, you go the same thing you do at your home, I think that's 
the best thing to have at the back of your head. Where whatever you do in your 
home to bring a good, happy home, I think would be good to bring a job. 
Christine Lewis: 
You, Darlene, what it is that you specialize in? Let's assume that you're working 
in the home but you come with something, a certain sort of [je ne sais 00:08:56] 
[quoi 00:08:56] that you come with from whence you came, that [00:09:00] you 
could bring to that family. Is that something special? Let's say, it could be 
cooking. Let's say you could bake a mean cake, or you could ice a mean cake, or 
you could sing. You might be a really great singer. You know, art is used to assist 
the kids, too, in a big way. For me [inaudible 00:09:16] artistic, you know with 
music and dance. I come in naturally as an artist performer. That's what I bring 
to my job. 
Darlene Flores: 
Job. 
Christine Lewis: 
As an educator, too. You know? We all have that special thing that you could, 
[00:09:30] you know? I could say, listen- 
Darlene Flores: 
I like just reading stories and stuff, singing, and stuff. Basic stuff that kids enjoy. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Darlene Flores: 
I should say that. Keeping them active. 
Christine Lewis: 
That expertise, that thing that you might have done in Trinidad that you bring 
with you to the job wherever you might have worked. You might have worked 
as a beautician, but you come to the home and you might dolls up the kids, in 
other words beautify the kids. Something like that. Whatever you used to do 
home or whatever you used to do that- 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
6
Darlene Flores: 
[00:10:00] Well, more like I say, singing, dancing, just having them, you know, 
having fun. 
Christine Lewis: 
All right, so- 
Darlene Flores: 
All kids are different, so like you get to know the kid, what they like, what they 
enjoy, and then you work with whatever. 
Christine Lewis: 
This question has to do with what you bring, that special thing that you used to 
do. 
Darlene Flores: 
Basically no, just singing, dancing and whatever they enjoy, as I say. Even if I 
bring in something that I think the person, the kid might [not 00:10:27] like it, 
you know? 
Christine Lewis: 
The glean from our [00:10:30] culture, this is the conversation we've been 
having- 
Darlene Flores: 
Singing.  
Christine Lewis: 
-because the glean from our culture and it's a beautiful gift in that, we as 
domestic workers can bring to a home that doesn't have that. That's what they 
glean from where it's ... And we'll come back to that. 
Darlene Flores: 
Something different. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. 
Darlene Flores: 
Something different. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, whatever it is. 
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah. 
Speaker 2: 
Sorry to interrupt. Because I talked to Darlene before, what about the 
cleanliness?  
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, hygiene and stuff. 
Speaker 2: 
Hygiene? Can you tell me a bit about ... Because that seemed like something 
that you were passionate [00:11:00] about and you had talked about your 
grandmother and ... Can you talk about the importance of ... 
Darlene Flores: 
[inaudible 00:11:06] tell me that. 
Christine Lewis: 
Well, we're telling stories, so that's why. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Darlene Flores: 
Okay. 
Speaker 2: 
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Darlene Flores: 
No, no, no, no, no. I understand. As I said, with my ancestors, and being the first 
[gran 00:11:23], she always taught us to have a clean environment. We must 
have, especially when you're dealing with [00:11:30] kids, make sure that your 
bottle is sterilized and stuff like that, in order for them not to get a cold. There's 
a lot with like hygiene and stuff that I always [maintain 00:11:42] and I think it's 
like stuck on me. Sometime I'm over.  
 
One time I was like in this job and the dad would help me because they have 
dinners and stuff. The dad would help me wash the dishes because sometimes 
the dishwasher is over-packed and sometimes after [00:12:00] he washes the 
pot, I would see like a little spot of potatoes and stuff and I would go it, and one 
day he called me. He's like, "Oh, it's not clean enough for you, right, Darlene?" It 
was kind of funny. I go to him, "Oh, I'm sorry, you know, but there was 
something stuck in there." They knew me like that and that was a big help, too, 
because seeing that I had brought that into the home and they realize, they 
would also help with the housekeeping. That, "Oh, she already cleaned here. 
She didn't like this." They would help and stuff. "Oh, kids, you put away your 
stuff." 
 
[00:12:30] Yeah, I think that was something that I brought into the house, and it 
was- 
Christine Lewis: 
That's ... Let me- 
Darlene Flores: 
It was a ... [crosstalk 00:12:38] 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, that's your little, as I said before, your little [inaudible 00:12:42]. We all 
have something that we're, you know.  
Darlene Flores: 
I'm a clean freak, sorry. A little too overboard, but that's just me.  
Christine Lewis: 
Would it freak, let me ask you, though, would it freak out the household that 
you're work with with that kind of cleanliness? Would it ... What was the 
[00:13:00] tension like with the family if any with that cleanliness? You come 
from where you come from with bent on hygiene, bent on washing this dish 
immaculate.  
Darlene Flores: 
This is not clean [inaudible 00:13:12].  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
8
Christine Lewis: 
Immaculate, taking that gunk off of that ... By the way, I would do the same. I go 
in, it's funny. When I go to work where I work, I take all the dishes out of the 
dishwasher and wash it over.  
Darlene Flores: 
Okay. You a little worse than I am.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, I [00:13:30] take ... Yeah.  
Darlene Flores: 
Okay.  
Christine Lewis: 
It's funny because that's my madness. You know what I feel, I feel if I don't bring 
my cup, I'll have to drink out of that glass or cup and it's not washed clean 
enough. I think for me, believe it or not, not to make it about me, but for me it 
was a catharsis or catalyst about something that I dealing with at the sink that I 
needed to take those glasses and cups and spoon back outside of the [00:14:00] 
dishwasher. Quite frankly, dishwasher really don't do a good job.  
Darlene Flores: 
It don't do a good job, yeah.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah- 
Darlene Flores: 
It don't do a good job.  
Christine Lewis: 
It don't, it don't.  
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah.  
Christine Lewis: 
I have seen dishes right here, you know, you take it out where people drink and 
they still have lipstick stain. You're right, things like pasta where you stain the 
pasta with cake onto the spoon. I've seen it back in the drawers. When I go 
there, I take the things back out of the drawer and wash them. It could be 
something about me. 
Darlene Flores: 
Another thing I noticed with dishwashers, sometimes they just eat even with 
salad and you have balsamic [00:14:30] vinegar and you just put it in and you 
would see salad, the lettuce and stuff, still in. I think you should at least rinse it 
off with underwater and put it in the dishwasher.  
Christine Lewis: 
That cleanliness doesn't drive a wedge? For some people it could be. Some 
people say you're OCD, you know.  
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, I have a sister-in-law that was like that.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, some people might say OCD. Culturally, we could be different people 
from- 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
9
Darlene Flores: 
That's [different 00:14:58] people as we say. It's different. Everyone [00:15:00] 
is different. Some jobs they will realize and will try to help [inaudible 00:15:04] 
and some just don't care because as we say, it's different people. It's the 
individual person and how you feel, you go in and you do what you have to do.  
Christine Lewis: 
When caring for a child, yeah, when caring for a child, what are some ways you 
help them fall asleep? We storytelling, we pulling- 
Darlene Flores: 
Sing.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah.  
Darlene Flores: 
Singing to them or even reading stories. Most of [00:15:30] time, I rock them to 
sleep.  
Christine Lewis: 
You rock them to sleep? 
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah. They love being rocked or taking them for a walk outside in the stroller. As 
again I says, all depends. You have to learn the kid and then you work with 
whatever. All kids are different. Some I would sing, some I would take them out 
and there's different techniques. All depends on ... You have to know the kid.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. What tricks- 
Darlene Flores: 
Learn them actually.  
Christine Lewis: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). What tricks do you use to get a child to eat or eat 
vegetables? 
Darlene Flores: 
[00:16:00] That is a tough one.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, because kids are finicky with foods.  
Darlene Flores: 
Sometimes you have to bribe them.  
Christine Lewis: 
When you say bribe- 
Darlene Flores: 
Something that they like.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, when you say bribe.  
Darlene Flores: 
You said, "Oh, try it. You're going to be healthy. You're not going to get sick, 
you're going to get strong." You know? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
10
Darlene Flores: 
"You won't have to go to the doctor. If you eat this, you're not going to be sick 
to go to the doctor," because most kids and even adults are scared of doctors. 
Sometimes [00:16:30] you tell them, "Oh, if you have these carrots, you're going 
to be healthy, you're not going to go to the doctor. The doctor's never going to 
see you because you're going to be so healthy you don't have to go." Stuff like 
that. That's like my number one. "You're going to be very healthy and strong." 
You're going to be like Popeye.  
Christine Lewis: 
I know, right.  
Darlene Flores: 
I did that with my son.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, I see. What are some of the ways you get a child to stop crying or fussing? 
What are some of the ways? 
Darlene Flores: 
I said, taking [00:17:00] them for a walk is pretty, one of the tops.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Darlene Flores: 
You know? All depends on the parents. Sometime they, some home allow 
television, like a favorite show, some don't. Sometimes I use the tablet that they 
all auto-play, instead of just hearing my voice all the time reading, reading, I just 
give them something different. Yeah, then they go to bed.  
Christine Lewis: 
That works? 
Darlene Flores: 
[inaudible 00:17:29] system.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Darlene Flores: 
[inaudible 00:17:31] [00:17:30] system, yeah.  
Christine Lewis: 
We're talking about medicines now. We're talking about doctors. We come to 
this one where, is there any home you partake remedies or medicine or folk 
remedies, medicines or folk remedies to help cure a child who's sick or teething 
that you bring from your culture, wherever you come from? 
Darlene Flores: 
So much. 
Christine Lewis: 
You came from Trinidad.  
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They have- 
Christine Lewis: 
Name them.  
Darlene Flores: 
-like teething- 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
11
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, what have you found [00:18:00] worked also to alleviate or relieved when 
that child seemed to be cranky [inaudible 00:18:05] what illness that they might 
be going through? 
Darlene Flores: 
As I said, [distraction 00:18:10] because there are some parents who don't like 
too much Tylenol and stuff unless they have to. Most home, actually, when they 
have to, but I kind of try and rock them. Depends on the kid. Take them, get 
them distracted with something that they like.  
Christine Lewis: 
Is there anything that you bring from your culture. I remember once a woman 
said to me, [00:18:30] a child had a rash. 
Darlene Flores: 
Oh.  
Christine Lewis: 
[inaudible 00:18:33] Trinidad. They child had a rash and she couldn't tell the 
parents, but she couldn't see the child in that itch, itch or whatever- 
Darlene Flores: 
Discomfort.  
Christine Lewis: 
Discomfort. She put the child, I think it was in Epsom salt or baking soda, that 
was in Long Island. She said, "Christine, that alleviate the baby so much." It was 
a toddler in some warm ... You know those are things we do for itch, itchy skin 
[00:19:00] or torn ... You know, there's that thing that you bring from home. 
Even like, I remember with teething, we used to use the pumpkin stem. I don't 
know if you remember- 
Darlene Flores: 
No.  
Christine Lewis: 
-about the pumpkin stem. Right, but something natural. Even the cold ice, too.  
Darlene Flores: 
Ice, I know for ice.  
Christine Lewis: 
Right.  
Darlene Flores: 
To soothe it off.  
Christine Lewis: 
What you bring culturally, you know, we cheat. We cheat [crosstalk 00:19:23] 
You know why we ... Let me just say why we cheat, because the babies can't 
speak for themselves. We are with the babies literally 24/7. This [00:19:30] is 
when I get feely/touchy. We are with the babies 24/7. We look at the babies cry 
sometimes uncontrollable. Even with your kid. I remember my daughter when 
she was young [crosstalk 00:19:39] she cried and I couldn't tell. I had to take all 
her clothes off to see what it was that was hurting my daughter. You know, I 
had to see what it was. She just cried. I remember her cry. That haunted me for 
a long while I was a young parent.  
Darlene Flores: 
Of course, because you don't want to see them like that.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
12
Christine Lewis: 
No, for me, it haunted me because I always look back. That was that one thing 
that [stook 00:19:55] out with my daughter. The kids we work with, we grow, 
there's a bond [00:20:00] that comes. 
Darlene Flores: 
Of course.  
Christine Lewis: 
We're not their parents. They call us 'mama'. They call us 'mama'. The parents 
resent it, they hate it, but we are in that home, too, 24/7 giving care for that 
child.  
Darlene Flores: 
[inaudible 00:20:11] I had a story about- 
Christine Lewis: 
That's why my point. The idea is to draw that story out, to tell that story. There 
is something that we do that pacifies the children. I would say to the mother, 
"Listen, I might go back and those children will [inaudible 00:20:24] up." I said to 
the mother, "Everything is not doctor or growing fever." 
Darlene Flores: 
Exactly.  
Christine Lewis: 
All the kids I work with, [00:20:30] I saw [inaudible 00:20:30], but western 
medicine is what westerners are used to.  
Darlene Flores: 
Right, or even something that we know about. 
Christine Lewis: 
That's my point. I would say, "Look, he getting a cold. It's a growing fever, or 
that cold that I'm looking, seen him growing at very often in winter." When I go 
back the next week, it's like, whoa, little baby grew up.  
Darlene Flores: 
Interesting.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, but that's what I'm talking about.  
Darlene Flores: 
Actually, two things that you pointed out there, too. Even the last job that I had, 
when I went into that job on the Monday, the parents never [00:21:00] even 
knew the child was cutting his first tooth. I told them, like, "Oh, do you know 
he's cutting the teeth there?" They said, "Oh, it's amazing how you saw that." 
That was with the teething and stuff.  
Christine Lewis: 
What was the sign- 
Darlene Flores: 
I also- 
Christine Lewis: 
What was ... Let me interrupt you for a minute, was there a sign that you saw it? 
Darlene Flores: 
He was crying.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Domestic Workers United

Darlene Flores: 
He was crying and stuff, and drooling a lot. That was a sign, drooling is a number 
one sign to me. This other incident that you talked about with the medicine 
[00:21:30] from back home, I had [trial 00:21:32] medicine called, [Candid B 
00:21:33]. It's not from Trinidad, but it's from in there. I had used it and it's very 
good for rashes. Now, the family that I was working with had taken, his name 
was [Matt 00:21:45], taken him to dermatologist after dermatologist. He had a 
bunch of stuff on his skin. When I went home on vacation, I bought the Candid 
B. I didn't say anything to her, which I didn't want to because some of them 
reject; [00:22:00] like in your mind you know this is going to work. I took a little 
of the Candid B and I keep just a little bit, like a ringworm. It looked like that, but 
it wasn't the ringworm. I took the Candid B and I keep rubbing it every time I 
give him his bath in the night. Eventually, it faded in days. It's a very good 
medicine. A very good cream, actually. 
 
When I told her, when it was almost gone, I was like, "You know I have 
[00:22:30] a confession to make." She said, "What?" I said, "Look at his hands." I 
don't want to call the child's name, I don't like it. She looked at it and she said, 
"Where is it?" It was almost just a ... I said, "That's my confession. This is what I 
bought." She was really ... She looked into it, obviously after because it's like, 
you got to see the ingredients and stuff like that. I couldn't care less. I knew 
what the cream could have done and [00:23:00] I used it. She said, "[inaudible 
00:23:03]." I said, "If you're not comfortable with the [inaudible 00:23:05], if he 
ever gets it back, you can dilute it with petroleum jelly. Just to kill whatever is 
[stored 00:23:14] and stuff." Never came back on his hand. He's grown and I 
even left, bought and extra tube, never came back.  
Christine Lewis: 
Could I say that you talk about that eczema thing? Most times, the doctors here, 
again, the western doctors would [00:23:30] say, and I remember thinking 
[inaudible 00:23:33] doctor. The doctor, it was kind of, it was a low blow to me 
as a what we call, third world women that we are, according by the western 
standards. Kids here get ringworm. They call is eczemas.  
Darlene Flores: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
It's ringworm. He tried to tell me that it's only a third world thing. It's not only a 
third world thing. [00:24:00] It's not only a third world thing. My daughter got it 
and it was in the schools here. When the kids get beside each other- 
Darlene Flores: 
Oh yeah, bacteria.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, no, no, no, but doctors here, the doctor that I took the kid to said to me, 
"No, no, no, no, no." When I brought it up, he said, "No, no, no, no, no. That's a 
third world thing. I know better." It's not a third world thing.  
Darlene Flores: 
Even with taking care of kids as the difference from back home and now 
because I remember when I had my son and all my brothers and they're growing 
up, [00:24:30] we would put the baby to lay on their tummy.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
14
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Darlene Flores: 
We had always done that. You came here, "Oh, you got to put them on their 
back." They were even talking about it in the news the other day. It's different 
things we learn differently and different cultures, but hey. 
Christine Lewis: 
We learn it, but what do we do as caregivers, that's the question, who works in 
the home and see that the kids go through. I have, listen, I have, that same 
thing, the mother I work with the kid with the baby on the baby's [00:25:00] 
tummy. Sometimes when the kid, I believe, especially if the child is having a 
hard time sleeping [crosstalk 00:25:06] Right, no, I put the child on the side and 
sometimes he sleep the longest. His little legs across and his arms across and he 
sleep really long. He was getting up really, really early. Really, every time I put 
him down, I had to go back into the room.  
Darlene Flores: 
We would put them in [inaudible 00:25:22] position and most kids, especially 
when they start moving and as we adults, too, they always position their self 
where they're more comfortable [00:25:30] and just ... I'm just like sharing the 
different ways where we've learned it and they've learned it. Eventually, some 
kid would even be on the tummy, on their back, they'll be on their side, they'll 
be all over just for their comfort.  
Christine Lewis: 
Could I say we know, too, because we work with the kids. 
Darlene Flores: 
Of course.  
Christine Lewis: 
We know when their parents leave, what works and what doesn't work.  
Darlene Flores: 
Exactly.  
Christine Lewis: 
How to rectify and deal with it. That's how we can tell the parents whether they 
take it or not, we've been with that kid 24/7, some of us. Some of us have had 
long days, so we know [00:26:00] that sleeping pattern. The baby's not taking a 
bottle, you're not giving the baby formula. They be relying on breast milk. It's 
not the [crosstalk 00:26:08] 
Darlene Flores: 
We know because we're there most of the hours, too.  
Christine Lewis: 
Right. Is there any special skill that you have to [inaudible 00:26:17]? Anything 
that you came with that? It could be cultural, it could be a little nuance, it could 
be anything that you have [taught 00:26:25] the parents and we all teach the 
parents something. [inaudible 00:26:28] change yourself, we all [00:26:30] teach 
people we've worked with- 
Darlene Flores: 
Of course, because [crosstalk 00:26:32] 
Christine Lewis: 
-if not them, their family members.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
15
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, because well as I say again, we are the ones who deal with the babies, so 
we learn the babies and- 
Christine Lewis: 
No, but is there a certain skill that you have taught the parent that ... Again, it 
was ... We could tie that into the question before with that little bit of medicine 
that you, you know, they went to the doctor and they got all kind of thing it 
wasn't. That rash wasn't going away but you brought that [candy 00:26:55], how 
you call it? 
Darlene Flores: 
Candid B.  
Christine Lewis: 
Candid B, and it worked. Something like that, something you [00:27:00] gave to 
the parents or you showed the parents. It could be a food item, too. It could be 
the way you sorting something. Is there anything in particular? 
Darlene Flores: 
I had a conversation before about feeding and stuff like with finger feeding and 
you know ... Most parents actually, sometimes they have their first baby and 
stuff, so I will give my experience, what I had with my kid- 
Christine Lewis: 
What would that experience be? [crosstalk 00:27:24] As opposed to being 
vague, we want to pull the story. What would that experience be? [00:27:30] 
Give one scenario or one situation.  
Darlene Flores: 
When it's the right time to give them finger feed. They pick up their own stuff 
and eat, yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. What is- 
Darlene Flores: 
Eating on their own.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yes, what is the best part of your job? Give me an example.  
Darlene Flores: 
Spending time with the baby.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah? How so? We use the key word, patient. To me, sometime the parents 
make the jobs difficult. [00:28:00] It's a baby for crying out loud. Some of us 
come as mothers already. Some of us come with six and 10 children to babysit 
other people's children. You have parents who tell you how to do it. When it's 
the baby, and I'm not putting words in your mouth and I don't want to ... I could 
give a multitude of stories. I love to tell domestic worker stories, I really do. It 
has been my experience.  
Darlene Flores: 
Experience, right.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, I don't want to put words in your mouth. While we say the baby, the 
parents, some of them are nightmares [00:28:30] from Elm Street.  
Domestic Workers United

Darlene Flores: 
Of course.  
Christine Lewis: 
I don't want to say it for you. 
Darlene Flores: 
No, no, no.  
Christine Lewis: 
I'm just saying to you- 
Darlene Flores: 
No, you're right, though.  
Christine Lewis: 
You're right. As I say, what is the best part, give an example. I guess you'll come 
to that.  
Darlene Flores: 
The best part of the job? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah.  
Darlene Flores: 
I focus on the babies.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yes, okay.  
Darlene Flores: 
Spending time with the babies. Seeing them growing up and doing different 
things, I enjoy that. They going from step to step and learning different things. I 
enjoy that.  
Christine Lewis: 
What is the worst part of your job? I believe you have had tumultuous 
[00:29:00] or many, a multitude.  
Darlene Flores: 
Worst part is when you can't have that relationship because- 
Christine Lewis: 
With who? 
Darlene Flores: 
With the parents. When you don't have that relationship and a lot of parents as 
you say, if you comment an idea, they would object, "Oh, don't do this. Don't do 
that." You made a statement to them like they get ... What should I say? I don't 
... I want to use the right [00:29:30] word. They get jealous.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, yeah you could say, you could say.  
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
That's why we here. We have a nice conversation because it's true, too.  
Darlene Flores: 
Sometimes, yeah. Time for that, I kind of back off because one time one parent 
say, "Oh, you can't hug him." I don't hug a baby as much as I want to hug a baby 
sometimes, it all depends. Unless I get that consent. I've learned that.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
17
Christine Lewis: 
Wow.  
Darlene Flores: 
You can hug the baby.  
Christine Lewis: 
Wow.  
Darlene Flores: 
One of my friends actually [00:30:00] told me, they called last weekend and said 
they parent told her, "I don't want you kissing the baby when you're leaving." 
She's like, "Okay, I didn't mean to get you upset now." "If he ever calls you 
'mama', I'm going to die." Those were the words. "If he ever calls you 'mama', 
I'm going to die." 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow.  
Darlene Flores: 
I had an incident. Actually, my last job when there was a little conflict and the 
father said, "Give me my child." [00:30:30] I said, "It's yours. I have a son and I 
can never love your kid as much as I love kid. I will always love my kid because 
this is mine. I love your kid in a different way. You love your kid in a different 
way and you can never love my kid the way that I love my kid." It's a difference. 
I think the more we get to understand this, because I mean, I, as a mother, I 
cannot see. I don't care [00:31:00] how ... I love my kid more than everything 
else. I will love your child because I'm there and who cannot love a baby, 
anyway. A lot of parents, I always know how to step in from experiences, I don't 
go too beyond until it's okay.  
Christine Lewis: 
How's your relationship with your current employer? 
Darlene Flores: 
My current employer? [00:31:30] Terrible. It was terrible.  
Christine Lewis: 
How so? How so? 
Darlene Flores: 
The mother was very, a nice person, but- 
Christine Lewis: 
You mean the wife of your employer? 
Darlene Flores: 
The wife, yeah, the baby's wife- 
Christine Lewis: 
The baby's mother.  
Darlene Flores: 
The baby's, sorry, the baby's mother was a very ... You can see from her family 
and stuff. I never saw her family, but they spoke to me on Skype and she was 
very ill. Actually, I got this job through the internet, [00:32:00] my last job. I 
came up and I say, I'm going to do it because I had the- 
Christine Lewis: 
You came up from where? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
18
Darlene Flores: 
From my country, Trinidad. I was home. My mom was sick and I had an 
interview in June of last year. When I came ... No, I check my emails and I saw 
that they replied and they was trying to get in touch with me. I said, my phone is 
[de-active 00:32:23], but you can get me through email. They did, wanted me to 
work, [00:32:30] and they told me, well, can I come in December? I said, "Well, 
okay, but I can't just leave. I'll make arrangements. Is it okay if I come in 
January?" She said, "Sure." When I came up, I realized that she was very ill. I 
came up- 
Christine Lewis: 
The mother of the baby was ill? 
Darlene Flores: 
The mother of the baby was very ill. When I came that Saturday, the husband 
was in control of everything. I [00:33:00] had the summary and then he said, 
"Three weeks without pay." I said, "Three weeks without pay? What am I going 
to tell my landlord?" The mom was so ill, she was on the sofa and she said, 
"Let's just see how it goes." When I started working that Monday, I went on 
Monday, they said that they were going to work. He left knowing that none of 
them can work because the mom had cancer and the [00:33:30] father, he's a 
stay-at-home dad. Getting to realize with his attitude he can't even work 
anywhere. After six months I realize that. He was home and then when they told 
me she had cancer, they asked me if I can work day and night because they have 
no family member here. The father was from ... Can I say where he's from? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah.  
Darlene Flores: 
He was from Turkey and the wife was from Greece. He had this attitude that 
he's [00:34:00] the man of the house and you got to do what I say, labeling 
food, you know, stuff like that. When I go in, I would see- 
Christine Lewis: 
[Expound 00:34:13] on labeling the food. Tell me a little more about the labeling 
the food.  
Darlene Flores: 
The labeling of the food was only the mother's name. She was the one who's 
bringing in the money. He didn't work. The oranges was [Maria 00:34:25]. You 
go into the fridge, it's Maria. Maria, Maria, Maria. A couple [00:34:30] ... started 
bringing in little stuff to eat. I told her, "I'm coming in here for 10 hours. I'm 
getting 'x' amount of money. I'm not going to just like collapse because you guys 
are not going to have anyone to take care the baby." She started getting bagels 
and stuff and I had to cook my own food, which I didn't have a problem with 
and stuff. One day I told her, "In my country, food is ... You consume food 
[00:35:00] and you know where it goes. I'm not comfortable and seeing anyone 
labeling food." 
Speaker 2: 
I'm sorry, so they would label food so that you wouldn't eat their food? 
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
19
Speaker 2: 
Oh my god.  
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah.  
Speaker 2: 
Is that common? Is that- 
Darlene Flores: 
No, no, no- 
Christine Lewis: 
No. That's not common. 
Speaker 2: 
That's wild.  
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, he was just uncivilized and not used to food. It's so funny, don't put this 
on the thing, but anything he consumed [00:35:30] ... I'm joking. Anything he 
consumed, he let it out. That was the father.  
Christine Lewis: 
Could I ... Hold your thought on that, but could I say this, that depending on the 
culture of the people, they don't want you to bring the food in. I remember my 
[girlfriend 00:35:44] was living in and when she would make her macaroni pie, 
her Trinidad food, she would bring it on Sunday, and the man tell her, "Don't 
put her food in the fridge." She said, "Christine, I used to throw out the food." 
It's the labeling, it's kind of common. You hear [00:36:00] people are told, don't 
bring certain foods in their house. Yeah, don't bring [crosstalk 00:36:04] 
Darlene Flores: 
He would label their own food, whatever she buys. When I told her about it, she 
said, "You know, write whatever you need." That's how it was. I told her, 
"Listen, in our country, we throw food for the dogs. Whatever we don't want, 
the neighbor, you want something? I'm going to cook today. Come over, have 
lunch." It's very degrading and if you're not [00:36:30] ... I think it's shameful. 
It's a shameful thing to do to someone. Things started escalating and escalating. 
Because of the baby, I fell in love with the baby the moment I saw that baby 
when I walk in there, the Saturday, and I hang in when Wednesday she was 
admitted at New York Presbyterian, and I stayed in that job from the sixth to the 
18th. 
Christine Lewis: 
Of where? 
Darlene Flores: 
January when I started.  
Christine Lewis: 
This year, 2016? 
Darlene Flores: 
2016. Day [00:37:00] and night. They had no one, no family member, and 
because of the baby and her situation I said, "Okay." I stayed in there and I 
worked from the sixth to the 18th, day and night.  
Christine Lewis: 
You lived in? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Darlene Flores: 
Just for those two weeks. It was not [inaudible 00:37:21] because she was being 
sick, I stayed in. Yeah. It [00:37:30] was a very, very ... It was the worst job for 
my 18 years I should say because normally I would just walk away. Why it was 
even worse is because, I came from Trinidad with a one-way ticket, got myself 
situated to do the job and ... I just had to take the abuse for six months until it 
started escalating and got out of hand.  
Christine Lewis: 
Are there relationships with any of your previous children that you worked 
[00:38:00] with, memorable? 
Darlene Flores: 
Oh yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
That you could in a good, bad, or in a different kind of way, that you could 
recall? 
Darlene Flores: 
I have- 
Christine Lewis: 
What has been your relationship? Can you name one or two that you could 
remember, that you could recall that was really memorable? [crosstalk 
00:38:19] 
Darlene Flores: 
I lived with a family for almost four years. We had, I should say like [98% 
00:38:26] of the time. We really had good times traveling and seeing the 
[00:38:30] kids growing up. Even the day they ... Once they know I'm around, 
they would call me and I'll go over and see them and stuff. 
Christine Lewis: 
You still have a good relationship with them? 
Darlene Flores: 
Oh yes. Oh yes. That's my reference every time I have to get a job. Even my last 
job, she said, "Oh, I called and they had nothing. They had really, really, really 
good things to say about you. Nothing bad." I have- 
Christine Lewis: 
The kids? What stands out with the kids? I know you talk about traveling. Is 
there anything that particularly [00:39:00] juts out that you remember, that 
kind of keeps you smiling? 
Darlene Flores: 
You know what? That family, was a lot of trust. It's really good to see, she 
allowed me to bring her two kids from Florida back to New York. She would give 
me her social security number if I had anything to do. It was like, it really, you 
could say it's a, wow. To see that someone have that trust in you, it was really a 
good feeling.  
Christine Lewis: 
[00:39:30] How do you manage your emotional feelings with a child or family 
you're caring for? That's big because we work with the family. We have 
emotions, we have feeling. Going back to the story that you tell just now, I 
mean, that's as you say, wow.  
Domestic Workers United

Darlene Flores: 
That's not even half of it.  
Christine Lewis: 
I bet.  
Darlene Flores: 
[Know 00:39:55] patience. Patience. Patience as my grandmother says, is 
overdue. You have to just ... [00:40:00] try and think about good things. 
Sometimes I'll call my son home, family members, speak to them, just hearing 
their voice and that would kind of cheer me up.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. It's not easy to deal here. You're giving, you're talking about a sick 
woman, you're talking about the baby in this situation, right? The mother is at 
the Presbyterian Hospital, god forbid, nobody wants to be sick and this baby is 
innocent. You're dealing with this man who you really, clearly, [00:40:30] 
doesn't seem like, you know. He's like [inaudible 00:40:33].  
Darlene Flores: 
Worse.  
Christine Lewis: 
How do you harness the feelings though? It's sad because we're, you know.  
Darlene Flores: 
The good thing about it is that, he would stay away from me. I would be at the 
job and he would be in his bedroom most of the times. That kind of kept me 
because certain things, he would like you know ... I would tell him, "I'm not your 
maid. I'm not going to be throwing the trash out. [00:41:00] I would put my foot 
down." I think his wife would just tell him to, "Keep away from her. Leave her 
alone." One day when I was walking away, she said, "Leave her alone." She told 
him, "Leave her alone," because I think she was like ... I went all day and I really 
put that effort into that baby.  
 
As I was saying, her parents [inaudible 00:41:19] on Skype and seeing that I was 
there. Her friends to see that you stayed on this job for two weeks. I was a total 
stranger, everyone really appreciated. [00:41:30] Her mom came on Skype, "Oh 
Darlene, we love you." They sent me a little gift from Greece. Her brother came 
from Greece and really appreciate. That kind of let me realize, you know what, 
do this for Maria and the baby. Don't do this for him. I just blank him off. He was 
like not much in my eyesight, which I didn't want him in my eyesight. That was 
good and then- 
Christine Lewis: 
Damn, that's a love/hate relationship, boy.  
Darlene Flores: 
Oh yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
What you call? A [inaudible 00:41:58] relationship.  
Darlene Flores: 
I [00:42:00] stayed out most of the times with the baby. The same way he 
stayed away from me, I tried to stay away from him. It worked out. To six and a 
half months. Couldn't go anymore [inaudible 00:42:11], god knows why.

Christine Lewis: 
Let me just go off the beaten track. Do you think, you said he's from a foreign 
place, right? 
Darlene Flores: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Christine Lewis: 
Turkey, right? 
Darlene Flores: 
Turkey.  
Christine Lewis: 
Do you think the patriarchal system has a lot to do with that? 
Darlene Flores: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
You know that manly, macho culture? 
Darlene Flores: 
Yes- 
Christine Lewis: 
We all come from cultures that are you know, men are ... Men make laws. 
[00:42:30] Pretty much, and men have [inaudible 00:42:33]. You look at 
parliamentarians, who especially, the [senators 00:42:40] here. These old, white 
men who talk about birth control for women when women should decide what 
they should use for their bodies. I'm thinking that comes to mind. As I hear all 
that is said, that patriarchal culture, that man dominance.  
Darlene Flores: 
I think so, because what happened, his mother came on the 18th, that's when I 
got released [00:43:00] and realized that she was an old woman, because he 
said his mom is going to come and she can help with the baby and cook. The 
cooking was most important because she was only cooking for him. She wasn't 
even cooking for the wife. I realized ... Yeah. She wasn't even cooking because 
she had ... No, because she had cancer and had to eat certain stuff and I'm 
telling you, I saw this man with a big silver bowl. [00:43:30] You know what we 
season [inaudible 00:43:31] with? He was eating salad with a spoon. In all this 
experience, I realize that he's not used to food. He was just banging ... I realized 
that the culture and even with the mother, he was yelling at the mother. One 
day I came in into the, listen to this [inaudible 00:43:54] and this is ... No 
[inaudible 00:43:57]. Listen to me.  
Christine Lewis: 
[00:44:00] Okay.  
Darlene Flores: 
The day when that mom was leaving the country for her brother to come 
because it's a small place, I walked in into that house and I saw that baby 
covered with feces and urine. The mother came, he had the little eating chair 
with the wheels and pushed the baby towards me. When I came in, the kitchen 
was filthy. It's like, oh, this is your last day here, let her do everything. That's the 
impression [00:44:30] I got. Kitchen was filthy- 
Christine Lewis: 
Because it's your last day-

It's the mother's last day.  
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, oh.  
Darlene Flores: 
It's her last day, so don't do anything. She's coming. We had an [inaudible 
00:44:40], like when we had the discussion and he said, "Oh, you take care of 
the baby, so you have to clean the baby." That's where I realized, I said, "Oh," I 
say, "You're a monster." I say, "Who father leaves their kids filthy like this for 
the nanny to come in?" I say, "You're a monster." [00:45:00] I said, "But I have 
one thing to tell you, it's a pleasure for me to come and clean that baby up." I 
say, "If I had to come at three o'clock in the morning to clean him up, I would. If 
you had sent me a taxi, I would come and clean him up at three o'clock instead 
of leaving him all night until I come in." The baby couldn't even go on the 
changing table. I took the plastic mat and i put him on the floor, clean him up.  
 
His mom, the baby's mom was laying in bed with [00:45:30] a lot of pain 
because she had radiation. She was taking her treatment. I told her, "It's 
ridiculous." I say, "How can you guys have someone come into your home with a 
filthy kitchen, baby covered with feces, and it's not bothering you?" She started 
crying. She said, "Darlene, I can't do it." I said, "You're not supposed to." Those 
two, meaning, the man and the mother, who's out there living the good life, 
they could help. They could help Maria, [00:46:00] and she was crying.  
 
I realize from the interview from, sorry, from the experience, she was getting 
abused from the man. I realize with the behavior, the way he was speaking to 
his mom, you know, "Oh, go see about the baby." He was actually yelling at the 
mom. I understood his culture, but it's just like, I wasn't having it. Yeah, we go 
through some tough ... You know what? It makes us stronger. It makes us 
stronger.  
Christine Lewis: 
[00:46:30] They say what don't kill you, make you stronger. 
Darlene Flores: 
It makes us stronger. 
Christine Lewis: 
Do you feel that the amount of hours you work and your holiday schedule are 
being respected? 
Darlene Flores: 
No.  
Christine Lewis: 
Whatever, respected? 
Darlene Flores: 
Nope. I wasn't respected. That was one thing I told him, too. That's why the job 
came to an end. I was like, if you don't respect your wife because she had ... One 
day when I came into the house, another thing, they garbage was in the middle 
of the kitchen. It was just sitting there. I'm sorry, that's why I came [00:47:00] 
after with the baby, I took the baby for a walk, [was 00:47:02] in the morning 
time. It was sitting there actually, this is for you.

Christine Lewis: 
He couldn't take it out? He brought it out in the middle of the room? 
Darlene Flores: 
No, he doesn't [crosstalk 00:47:13] He don't ever throw the trash. His wife does. 
He don't ever throw the trash. Since I'm there for the six months I saw him 
twice. He's not doing it because it's in his culture that he's the head of the house 
and the woman is who takes care [00:47:30] of him. The trash was there, I don't 
know if the garbage truck came up on the 14th floor, but the morning when I 
came in, it was not there. Trust me, that garbage truck [was 00:47:41] going to 
come up if they wanted that empty. I walk away like, "Have a good night," and I 
left. She started emptying. One time I even, while he was going out, it's like 
Maria, "[inaudible 00:47:52] can you throw the trash?" She sad, "No, I'll do it." 
She has ... I realize she was being abused. I also realized with [00:48:00] the 
consultation we had a dispute, she couldn't even talk, she couldn't even take 
the baby away from him. She couldn't do none of that.  
Christine Lewis: 
He wouldn't give them baby- 
Darlene Flores: 
He would not give the baby ...  
Christine Lewis: 
Oh.  
Darlene Flores: 
... to her. That, we had a quarrel on that Thursday. On Friday, I had to call the 
cops for him because he wouldn't pay me and he also pushed me. It was a big ... 
Yeah, worst experience. Worst, worst experience. I told them, "I've been doing 
this for 18 years. [00:48:30] You're from Greece and he's from Turkey. I've never 
worked with people who are non-Americans. You guys the first and you guys are 
going to be the last." Yeah. The Friday morning when I came, the last thing she 
told me is, "Go home and rest." [inaudible 00:48:48] because I asked for two 
weeks compensation.  
 
She said that her family would come and if I can come back and work in 
September, but when I asked for my two weeks, he said, "No, we have no 
money to pay you." I said, "I [00:49:00] know you have no money, because you 
don't work." I said, "Maria, can you pay me? Since you're the one who's 
working, you're the one who knows about responsibility, you're the one who 
has bills." He said, "No, I'm head of the household. You look at me when I speak 
to you." When he looked across, he was like a little away from me and I was like, 
"Excuse you? I said, please do not speak to me like that." I say, "You want 
respect, you have to give respect." I say, "Then again, if you don't respect your 
wife, [00:49:30] you're not going to respect me." He said, "Oh, you want to tell 
me about my wife? Give me my child." That's when everything came. I was like, 
"You do nothing." 
Christine Lewis: 
How he actually come to put his hands on you to be able to push you? What- 
Darlene Flores: 
That Friday, that was a Thursday evening and the Friday morning when 
everything, well, Thursday we were like, we were really giving each other ... I 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

told him, "Oh you don't do anything. You just lay in bed, go to the toilet, go to 
the kitchen. That's your routine. Bedroom, toilet, kitchen. Bedroom, toilet, 
kitchen." [00:50:00] Maria started laughing. I was like, "Yeah, you have all rights 
to laugh because he's a joke. Who treats woman like that? You don't respect 
them. You're a joke."  
 
She told me when he started, you know, we started telling each other off and 
then he said, I was gossiping about his mother. I said, "No, it's a difference 
between gossip and standing up for my rights. I told you, I am not your maid, 
I'm not your mother's maid. You [00:50:30] told me she was going to come here 
to help. Apparently, she was just like you and I'm not any maid's. I don't know 
anything about being a maid. You guys can work. There's no geriatric person 
here. It's not a geriatric house. Do your stuff, I'm here to take care of the baby."  
 
That Friday when Maria said, "Darlene, go home and rest and we'll talk about it 
tomorrow," the last thing when I was walking out, "Are you going to be there to 
open the door?" She said, "Yes." When I came in on that Friday, [00:51:00] he 
had my bags and he said, "You're fired." I said, "Can I come in the apartment 
and get my stuff? I'd like to speak to Maria. Maria told me I would see her on 
Friday morning." He said, "No, you can't see Maria." I said, "This is your stuff. I 
would like to come in and get my stuff. You don't know what my stuff is. I know 
what I have here from what I don't have here." I says, "As a matter of fact, 
there's my phone charger. I need to come in here." I yelled because he said the 
neighbor's going to hear. I said, " I don't care about the neighbors." I [00:51:30] 
say, "You better open this door and let me come in and get my stuff."  
 
He opened it up and then when I was trying to go into the room, I realize Maria 
and the baby was in there and with all the loud noise, the baby started crying 
and when I reached for the door to open to see Maria, that's when he pushed 
me. He had the baby and Maria locked into the bedroom. 
Christine Lewis: 
So that they couldn't see you? 
Darlene Flores: 
They couldn't see me.  
Christine Lewis: 
When you're coming for your stuff? 
Darlene Flores: 
He fired me, Maria didn't. She was locked into the bedroom. [00:52:00] When 
he pushed me, I call, "Did you just push me?" I called the doorman. I said, 
"[Richard 00:52:05], this man just pushed me. Can you call the cops?" The cops 
came and then he picked the phone up after and he said, "Richard, tell the cops 
to come here. I want her out of my house." I said, "You're late. They're going to 
be here. I call already." Someone came and escort us downstairs. He wasn't 
giving me my salary. The cops had to come upstairs and give me my salary. I 
made a report and [00:52:30] ... I'm getting hell from lawyers and stuff.

Christine Lewis: 
Would you say, so sorry, would you say the [nature 00:52:40] of the job's right 
and some of the people we meet on the journey, right? 
Darlene Flores: 
The what? 
Christine Lewis: 
I said, the [inaudible 00:52:45] of the beast, the jobs that we do- 
Darlene Flores: 
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
For caring, for loving a child. For just, you know.  
Darlene Flores: 
This was the most [inaudible 00:52:52] for the part. I know the father that baby 
has. When she's grown, she could [00:53:00] do her thing, but to have the baby 
in that kind of life, I think that's the worst thing [out 00:53:08]. I also realized 
was, I was with the baby, he would be happy and then he would [inaudible 
00:53:14]. There's a lot of helicopters around [Roosevelt 00:53:16] Island and he 
would be running like he's devastated. 
Christine Lewis: 
Who the baby? 
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah. I said, "Maria, why is it [inaudible 00:53:25], he always- 
Christine Lewis: 
Anxious.  
Darlene Flores: 
No, he's scared because of the noise. It's because of the father being abusive 
[00:53:30] to the wife. I see when I put pieces together and seeing little blue 
and black marks. I'm thinking it's from her injections and stuff. It's abuse. For 
him to push me like that, you got to be abusive to a woman to do something like 
that. 
Christine Lewis: 
Would you say that you or any other worker that you know has been exploited 
due to immigration status? 
Darlene Flores: 
Oh yeah, they take a lot of advantage because of that.  
Christine Lewis: 
Do you know anyone in particular? Any [00:54:00] person that has happened 
to? That you recall or you having any experience with? Some of these employer 
throw the fact that you don't have papers in your face or they'll call 
immigration. You hear it so fast and furious. 
Darlene Flores: 
You mean from employers? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Darlene Flores: 
No, no, no.  
Christine Lewis: 
Any experience?  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Darlene Flores: 
No, no, no.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Darlene Flores: 
I think we have a lot of people there that's not documented and that's the 
reason why they take advantage.  
Christine Lewis: 
It also should be the reason why they shouldn't.  
Darlene Flores: 
Exactly. If you're hiring someone who is not ... Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
You [00:54:30] and problems, too. Even to treat the person or say you're going 
to call immigration [crosstalk 00:54:35] 
Darlene Flores: 
Exactly, exactly. Exactly. 
Christine Lewis: 
It has never been your experience? 
Darlene Flores: 
No, no, no, no. No.  
Christine Lewis: 
Do you ever- 
Darlene Flores: 
I'm happy to go home anyway. We came from our Caribbean country, so hey. 
Send me home.  
Christine Lewis: 
You're ready to go back? 
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, because I remember this girlfriends, because everybody wants to come to 
America, everybody, ooh, this is like heaven. One time my girlfriend told me, oh, 
they [00:55:00] would see people crying in the embassy in Trinidad. She said, 
"Little, do they know. They're getting a favor done because home is the best 
home." It's hard for when we have to come and sacrifice. I remember my son, 
when I first came here, my son wasn't traveling. I tell his dad, "Listen, it's no way 
I can come to America and not see my son for years," because I have friends 
who sacrifice and have their kids leave their kids for, like eight, nine years. 
[00:55:30] They can't go home. My grandmother died, I couldn't go home to see 
her funeral. She's the one who brought me up.  
 
You know, it's really, really hard for us to sacrifice this ... Not anyone and we hae 
to count ourself very strong people to have to do something like that. Some of 
us leave our kids behind. I went back home and I told his father, "Listen, there's 
no way I can leave mys on. We have to go to the embassy and get him a visa." 
We did and he got through a visa. He would come [00:56:00] and travel. If he's 
leaving the next day to go back for school, we would cry, hug each other and cry 
the night before he leaves. We would hug each other, "Mommy, I don't want to 
go." I say, "Baby, you have to go. Mommy have to stay here and work." We 
would be crying that night before and is like, "I want to die before you." We 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
28
would start saying things. "No, I want to die before you." "I want to die before 
you." There's so much love with our kid and the sacrifice that we have to go 
[00:56:30] through, we need to be respected and appreciated more than we are 
right now.  
Christine Lewis: 
Do you ever share cultural things from your heritage with the families? 
[inaudible 00:56:42] you work for example, food, language, folk tale, a belief.  
Darlene Flores: 
Our [carnival 00:56:48]. Our carnival. Our carnival is like- 
Christine Lewis: 
What have you shared? 
Darlene Flores: 
We have fun, we have costumes, everyone have a good time. If you ever have to 
go to Trinidad, go around carnival time. [00:57:00] It's a little crazy, but it's fun 
and it's nice to know about a culture. Also, tell them about [inaudible 00:57:06], 
which is very tourist-like. I talk about the [inaudible 00:57:13] reef and stuff like 
that and island pool. When the boat takes you out and all you see around you is 
ocean and you can stand in the middle of the ocean and just be surrounded by 
water. That tourism and stuff. I share that with them, the music pan, [00:57:30] 
you know, the fun things. The kids that [inaudible 00:57:32] I make macaroni pie 
and stuff. They love our food. Some of the places, we can't really put out our 
cooking because you will become a cook before you know it. Sometimes I had 
most of the stuff- 
Christine Lewis: 
You hide? 
Darlene Flores: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
Interesting.  
Darlene Flores: 
Hold back some of my cooking. "No, I can just do pasta and make a few 
[crosstalk 00:57:56] 
Christine Lewis: 
Why though? 
Darlene Flores: 
You become a cook.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see, okay. Thank [00:58:00] you.  
Darlene Flores: 
You become a cook. That would be another additional thing to your- 
Christine Lewis: 
Job.  
Darlene Flores: 
-job where your salary is being small and more work.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Darlene Flores: 
"No, I can cook just the basic." I'm a good cook. That family that I work with for 
three and a half [inaudible 00:58:17], I would make ... I call [inaudible 00:58:19]. 
I made macaroni pie for them. They love it.  
Christine Lewis: 
They had the expectation of wanting that all the time, right? 
Darlene Flores: 
Yes. "Can you make your favorite?" I had a [00:58:30] friend who had that same 
problem right now. The kids are all in school, they are grown. Now she has, "Oh, 
can you make this delicious chicken and can you make your delicious 
meatballs?" She's stuck now with cooking for them. I was like, oops, you 
shouldn't go there. 
Christine Lewis: 
It's true, though.  
Darlene Flores: 
It is.  
Christine Lewis: 
You start to cook and after time they want everything.  
Darlene Flores: 
You know, as I said, you can do things for people who appreciate [00:59:00] you. 
That family had appreciate me, so I would do ... I would take care of those kids 
like it's my kids. Make sure their sneakers are clean, I would go to the extreme.  
Christine Lewis: 
So true. 
Darlene Flores: 
Unfortunately, it's like as I said, different type of people you just have to know 
your border and how much you have to bring out.  
Christine Lewis: 
It's funny because you're right, when they're nice, they get more. 
Darlene Flores: 
Exactly. Money is not everything. There's times money is not everything, trust 
me. It wasn't everything. It wasn't everything.  
Speaker 2: 
Before you ask that, [00:59:30] we're about to go into your family, how you 
manage your personal life, can you just describe your ... You mentioned briefly 
that you're part of a big family. That you were the first [grand 00:59:49]. 
Darlene Flores: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Speaker 2: 
Can you just explain that a [01:00:00] little bit, just so ... Like I said, how big was 
your family? You grew you with a lot of [sisters 00:59:57].  
Darlene Flores: 
Okay. I was the first and my brother the sixth. He died. He was two and then my 
dad was a little on the fast lane. I had five, four brothers and one sister on my ... 
He separated from my mom and I have ... It was my brother and I were the only 
first two. I lost him 2004. He was to be the best man for my wedding and he 
does before. It was very hard. That's [01:00:30] about it. I'm like, just basically 
two on my mother's side.  
Domestic Workers United

Christine Lewis: 
Your father's side [crosstalk 01:00:36] is more? 
Darlene Flores: 
Is five, yeah. I'm the first girl for a long while.  
Christine Lewis: 
What is your relationship like with those on your father's side? The kids that 
your father have. 
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, we- 
Christine Lewis: 
You recognize each other as brother and sisters? 
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, but not as much as of course my blood brother. We don't see each other, 
but we still try to live and love and stuff. Yeah, communicate and stuff.  
Christine Lewis: 
Let me go, how do you manage [01:01:00] balancing your personal life, family 
life, and your work life? You're here, you have your work life.  
Darlene Flores: 
I'm here with my work life. My son is older now. He's 30 [01:01:10] years old, 
believe it or not. With all Skype and WhatsApp, and Messenger and stuff, it's 
much easier with the technology. It's still hard. It's still hard. He has a daughter 
that I love so much. It's still hard. That's what I'm saying, the sacrifices. When 
you sacrifice, you should have more respect [01:01:30] and you should be more 
appreciated. Appreciated first.  
Christine Lewis: 
Let me just come back to this question. You talk about the woman being in the 
hospital, you living in for that two weeks- 
Darlene Flores: 
For two weeks.  
Christine Lewis: 
What do you do? What is your life like for you outside the family? How are you 
able to balance? Come on, let's face it [crosstalk 01:01:54] 
Darlene Flores: 
It's sacrificing.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, no, but I want you to pull not to be vague, but to tell that story. [01:02:00] 
We want to be in our beds. We want to go home in our pillow. We want to go 
home to our comforter. You're not where you sleep, even if you snore you 
might [not 01:02:09] want somebody to hear you snore. You know, you might 
go to bed late. How do you balance that, though? How do you find that, carve 
that time for you when all that, for that two weeks you were surrounded with 
work, work, work, work? Period, work. [crosstalk 01:02:23] 
Darlene Flores: 
It wasn't really that bad because the baby was seven months old. He was with 
the wife most of the times [01:02:30] in the hospital. I was pretty much by 
myself in the apartment and it was calm and it was, it wasn't bad. It was not bad 
experience, but I mean, you just have to focus. You're on a mission and you just 
have to keep that strong willpower and do what you have to do.  
Domestic Workers United

Christine Lewis: 
Let me ask you again, a root of that, a tentacle of that root, what do you do? 
What is your lifestyle like for fun, apart from working around the clock, dealing 
with this man who wasn't really nice to you? [01:03:00] What was your place of 
solace? Where would you go to [crosstalk 01:03:05] 
Darlene Flores: 
I might take walks with the baby- 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, but your community of people. What would you do? [inaudible 01:03:11] 
all time. 
Darlene Flores: 
You know what, once you [inaudible 01:03:14] to me, this is how I do it and I 
would talk to my family as I tell you about. To me, it's like, with all the 
experience and stuff and I guess I get older, it's like it's not no big thing. I would 
just read a book, play games [01:03:30] on my tablet, read a book or something 
and just to get that peaceful. It's not forever, as my grandmother say, nothing is 
forever. When that time comes to work, I take my job very seriously because 
that's my bread and butter and it comes first because with all that, you can't 
survive, so I always put my job first. If I'm here for whatever time and I go on 
vacation, it's more like ... It's like a relief. Okay, I'm ready to explore. [01:04:00] 
When I comes to work, I work. I just focus on my work. I try to get myself active, 
take walks, read a book, play a few games, talk to my family.  
Christine Lewis: 
Are you a member of other organizations or groups? 
Darlene Flores: 
No.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay.  
Speaker 2: 
I'm sorry. [01:04:30] I'm sorry. How do you explain it to you son your job? When 
you talk about that great story you told about- 
Darlene Flores: 
With him [inaudible 01:04:30]. 
Speaker 2: 
What do you say to him? 
Darlene Flores: 
My son is older now and he's there with the girls. He took it really, really hard. It 
was difficult for him and he would tell me, "Oh mommy, you was not wrong and 
nothing can make up for this." It's very hurtful, you know what I mean. I try to 
let him realize that there's kids who doesn't have mom and dads [01:05:00] and 
they're dying. They lost their parents, but at least I'm still here. I try to put it off 
like that. "I'm here, I just can't hold you and stuff, but I'm going to come back." I 
said, "There's kids who don't even have mom and dads. They lost their mom and 
dad maybe by an accident or whatever. I'm still here and I'll always love you and 
it's a sacrifice. I'm making a sacrifice." 
Christine Lewis: 
What would your mom say? What would your mom say to you? What would 
your mom ... I know you're going back and you talk about your mom- 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
32
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, [01:05:30] my mom or everyone is excited right now because my mom as I 
say, is not well. She's ill. She likes having me in the house. We go to the beach 
and we have fun. It's hard for everybody when I'm away and vice versa when I'm 
away from them. Everything happen for a reason. Anytime that I get off that I 
can go visit them, I go.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see. 
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, it's a very [01:06:00] good feeling though, to be around my own family.  
Christine Lewis: 
When you're doing domestic work, do you feel part of a larger group or 
community? When you're doing the work you do, like [inaudible 01:06:09], do 
you feel like you belong to something else, another group or do you feel a part 
of a larger group or community? 
Darlene Flores: 
Sometimes, all depends. That's why I think when you keep yourself active, the 
less you ... That what it mean? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, yeah, but beside doing the work ... You know, [01:06:30] like I belong to a 
lot, I do a lot of things. Not just [crosstalk 01:06:34] I do a lot of ... 
Darlene Flores: 
To keep yourself active.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, a lot of active stuff that I do. I dance, I work out, I write, I act, I am very 
much- 
Darlene Flores: 
Active. 
Christine Lewis: 
Active, yeah. You know, communities. My church community or if somebody 
invite me to something and it's progressive, I go. [crosstalk 01:06:54] It's not just 
the work that we do, yes. 
Darlene Flores: 
Right, right. 
Christine Lewis: 
Some of [01:07:00] us can get [buggered 01:07:01] down by the job.  
Darlene Flores: 
I go out with friends and stuff, especially on a weekend. 
Christine Lewis: 
Break the ice a little bit. 
Darlene Flores: 
Yes, yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
The monotony. When and why did you become part of [DWU 01:07:12], as 
small as you came into the movement? What inspired you to come and be a 
part of DWU? 
Darlene Flores: 
It's something that I was always, funny enough, I saw it online-

Christine Lewis: 
Yes.  
Darlene Flores: 
The front experiences that the front people had and I [01:07:30] was like, "This 
[interested 01:07:31]," because my girlfriend told me about the bill of rights and 
stuff like that. I was always interested. In a sense that, why didn't they have 
them come to this earlier on? With my incident, what happened, my friend told 
me about someone that she knew that was in this group and it was so 
interested when it was exactly what I was thinking about for years. For someone 
to come, you know, [01:08:00] and form this group especially first. I know how 
hard it is for us. I know with the sacrifice, I know we are not being appreciated, 
we are just being disrespectful. This job is the hardest job on earth. As Oprah 
say, "A mother's job, she's not a mother, but she can say it's the hardest job on 
earth." These are kids that we have to groom to come [01:08:30] out into the 
world and to make the world a better place. I mean with DWU and all the bad 
experiences that we have been going through, I think it's a very, very good 
thing.  
Christine Lewis: 
Why did you choose to become a part of the movement? 
Darlene Flores: 
Because of my experience that I went through.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see. What has it meant for you and you work, that the domestic worker's bill of 
rights passed in 2010? What does that mean to you? 
Darlene Flores: 
It means a lot. It means a start [01:09:00] and it mean, and I think, and I've told 
a lot of friends that this is something that we really need to take serious and we 
really need to build. We need to build because no one likes to be humiliated, no 
one likes to be disrespectful, to have someone disrespect them and no one likes 
to ... Sometimes you feel like all your energy is just going to waste. We would 
spend so much years with these family and then, in one day it would deteriorate 
like it [01:09:30] was nothing. I think it's very, very interested that we come 
together. It's like, what should I say? It's like a barrier we're trying to put up 
from a fight or from a big tsunami. We should put a barrier where we can be 
safe and we should be respected and we should be appreciated.  
Christine Lewis: 
What would you like to see happen in the future with the bill of rights? 
Darlene Flores: 
I would like to see it grow bigger, I [01:10:00] shouldn't say bigger, but I would 
like to see more opportunities that we would have and more, what's the word? I 
would like us to be treated equally like everyone else. This is what I would like 
to see.  
Christine Lewis: 
From your perspective, why is domestic workers united important for domestic 
worker? I think you outlined it before, but why would ... If you had to tell 
somebody to come to the movement, why is that [01:10:30] important? Why is 
that important?

Darlene Flores: 
That's the only way for us to build, the more the merrier. There's a lot of people 
out there and as I told my friends, it's not like you're going to come to the 
meeting because your employee is giving problems. You come to the meeting to 
learn and to know your rights. As I said, when you put in 'x' amount of years and 
then you think, they can just do you what they want. There might be something 
where you can stop [01:11:00] or something that you can prevent from other 
people being treated or whatever experience, so I think it's important. [crosstalk 
01:11:09] Build it and get a greater ... What's the word? It would be for us to 
work better and for us to ... Wait, no not that. Not really [01:11:30] for us to 
work better, but for us to be more appreciated.  
Christine Lewis: 
What do you want the legislators to know? I know you say you're happy with 
the bills in [part 01:11:41], but what you want the legislators to know? If you 
were to go to Albany to talk to the lawmakers, who are the ones who sign the 
bills, what again would you want them to know? What would you say to them? 
Darlene Flores: 
I would like them to know that the need to tell about the DWU because we are 
all human, we have a very hard job, [01:12:00] and it really hurts when we put 
all this efforts and work time as everybody else. We try to really [help 01:12:11] 
the family and no one with experience or feel the way we felt unless they 
experience what we've been through. We know what we feel, we know the 
effort, we know the things that we experienced. Bottom line: we're humans, we 
need to be treated [01:12:30] equally.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, what area of education skills are you looking to gain? At this phase of your 
life, what would you like ... What you aspire to be or to do or to learn? We're 
always so ... We're learning, we're in the school of learning until we pass on. 
Everyday we learn something. Whether it's on the job, whether we walk out on 
the streets right now, we're always learning. I know I am. What, if you want to 
right now at this phase of your life, what [01:13:00] areas of education skill 
would you look forward to gaining? What would that be? What would that look 
like to you? What would that be? What you always wanted to do in your 
childhood? What was that thing that drove you? You got married, you had your 
son- 
Darlene Flores: 
I love singing. No, not married. I love singing and stuff like that. Even traveling. I 
think traveling would be ... Yeah.  
Christine Lewis: 
You'd work in the travel [01:13:30] industry? Would you work as a tourist guide 
or a travel industry agent? You know, there are things, we grew up and we want 
to be teachers, we want to be lawyers, we want to be doctors, we want to be 
this, you want to be that. [crosstalk 01:13:43] 
Darlene Flores: 
I like socializing.  
Christine Lewis: 
If you was to go back to school, what would you go back to school for?

Darlene Flores: 
Cosmetology.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. Oh, there you go. There you go.  
Darlene Flores: 
Yeah, I like that.  
Christine Lewis: 
Since you came into the DWU, is there any skill that [01:14:00] you got from 
DWU and why type of training? I know it's a short while for you, your situation 
and circumstances brought you to DWU, but in the meantime, when you came 
in and sat, what was that thing that makes you want to come back if you didn't 
have to go back to Trinidad on Friday? What is that thing that you saw? 
Darlene Flores: 
Learning about domestic workers, number one. I heard you guys, have little 
outings with touring and stuff like that. I think that [01:14:30] was quite 
interested.  
Christine Lewis: 
What was that is that, we have, that outing you talk about is, we have the ally 
groups. It's always about education.  
Darlene Flores: 
Right.  
Christine Lewis: 
Empowering with these other ally groups, what's going on with them over 
[inaudible 01:14:43] project- 
Darlene Flores: 
To come together.  
Christine Lewis: 
To come together, yes. This is what will make the struggle [crosstalk 01:14:49] In 
the end, this [crosstalk 01:14:49] 
Darlene Flores: 
It's like two in one. The bigger the, yeah. The bigger the group.  
Christine Lewis: 
Any words you want to share with us? I'm so grateful that we could have done 
this together and have a chance to talk [01:15:00] to you about your experience 
in DWU. Any words that you want to say to somebody that will come to the 
library of congress and will want to listen to this voice and say, "Oh my god, this 
might be my story," or "I didn't know this is what these women used to go 
through." What would you say to whoever is listening? Us, we're listening, we're 
all listening.  
Darlene Flores: 
Okay, well first I would say that I'm very happy to be introduced to DWU. I really 
enjoyed the [01:15:30] effort that you guys have been working towards ... 
making things better for domestic workers. I mean I enjoyed the short time that 
... and the things that I saw and even the help that I got, I really enjoyed and 
appreciated.  
Christine Lewis: 
It's not the end, right?

Darlene Flores: 
It's not the end.  
Christine Lewis: 
Good.  
Darlene Flores: 
As I told you, I am not here unfortunately, because [01:16:00] of my job 
situation. If I had a job waiting, I would keep onto this meeting, but as I told you, 
I have a lot of friends. I'm going to give you their numbers, who's very interested 
and I mean, that's all I can do for right now.
