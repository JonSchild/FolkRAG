3. Some fine Mexican play tunes and lullabies.

4. Some roaring western breakdowns with lots of singing between occasional bars.
We have traveled 1600 miles. The machine is working beautifully. We start on East
tonight. After a few stops we cross in to Arkansas and Louisiana.
Next address is in Huntsville, Texas.
Dornbush has killed my chance of getting real cowboy singers from Texas.
