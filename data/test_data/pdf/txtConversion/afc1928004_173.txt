COURTING IN THE RA1Nd 
Sang by JENNIE ENGLz. 
NE April morn, when walking down 
A. quiet country lane, 
1 
overtook a 
fair young girl, 
Whilst hurrying thro' the rain.' . 
I 
asked her " If she would accept 
My arm, and take a 
share 
Of my umbrella.". " Thanks,-kindsiz, 
I 
will," replied the fair. 
Spoken.. —One with golden locks, by Jove, 
, 
land, without one of these useful ,articles 
[holding up thubrFlfa] wheb
. she poPp'd 
her little arm in mine, my heartbeat to that 
degree it ;nea-rly disolated my ribs [of the 
umbrella I 
mean] it's a 
fact I 
thought to my-
self here's a 
chance to go -` 
CHORUS. • 
Courting in the rain, courting in the rain, 
I 
neter regret the day "met, my charmer in 
the lane ; 
8 
Courting in the rain, courting in The rain, 
'Twas sweeter far than moon or 6tar, whilst 
courting Mary Jane. 
The rain poured down alarmingly-, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it, 
There I 
quickly learnt her name. 
Sbc also told me where sivahved,.. 
With pa down at the farm, 
A 
farmer's daughter; well said I,' 
That is an extra charm-
Spoken. — I 
glozy in country life, ,and a 
farmer's daughter, what could be better, I 
wish'd the rain would keep on. as r 
rasilieg 
liked 
Courting, ilk-
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite brigbit, 
The little birds beau to sing 
My heart it felt so light. 
I 
gently pressed her arm in mine, 
And said now don't say " nay," 
0 
9 
But let me come and meet you here, 
Again soother day. 
Spoken..—Well she said I 
can't exactly de-
cide, you must ask my pa, so I 
made up my 
mind to go and inform the old gentlemait 
we'd been 
Courting, ,43e. 
We reached the old farm house, and the* 
She introduced to me, 
Her pa, ajolly nice old boy, 
With him I 
made quite free; 
I 
told him when and where I'd met, 
V 
His daughter in the rain, 
And bless'd the lucky chance that took, 
Me down, that country lane. 
Spoken.--The old gentleman was quite 
delighted "'with my kind attention, and I 
soon gain'd his consent, which proves the 
truth of the old proverb—" It never rains 
but it pours." and so it occurred to me 
through 
Courting, ato.

THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
ONCE I 
was as gay 
As a 
jolly cock sparrow, 
Who's percli'd upon an apple tree, 
Or down amongst the corn; 
But now clean through my heart, 
You could drive a 
large wheel-barrow, 
For my love has left a 
hole in it 
0 
where's Rosanna gone! 
CHORUS. 
I 
shall never kiss my love again behind the 
kitchen door, 
I 
shall never squeeze my darling's little finger 
any more, 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone, until it's 
rather sore, 
0 
where's Rosanna gone ? 
I'm sure no other maid 
Would equal my Rosanna, 
Without my love this manly form 
Will soon become a 
wreck: 
• 
11 
Of her Dad I 
was afraid, 
He's a 
disagreeable tanner 
And he's atm promised faithfully, 
He'd dislocate my neck. 
So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitch-
en door, 
But t 
ne'er shall squeeze my darling's little fin-
ger any more, 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone, until its 
rather sore, 
0 
where's Rosanna gone? 
Of an evening after tea, 
While her Daddy blew his bacce,' 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, 
And ask her to share my lot; 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my! how he would whack her, 
ipWhile I'd jump over the garden wall. 
As tho' I'd just been shot. 
I 
shall never, sm. 
rd jump'd over the wall one night. 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
66skgotiabOakietiblilititsaik. 
12 
And though I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her Dad, the tanner, 
Oh I 
my teeth they rattled like dominoes 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
Spoken. — At the end of our interview I 
FELT 
convinced that HE understood what 
TANNING' 
was, and so did L I 
also concluded— 
I 
should never, &c. 
Some say she's hid away, 
By her cruel Dad on purpose 
To cure her of her love for me, 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon, 
Shall they find my clay cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come, anddrighten 
her Dad 
'Mind the kitchen door. 
I 
shall neva/. 
Ilse. 
13 
Perhaps' She's on the Railway. 
EHOLD in me a wretched man, quite 
) broken down by woe, 
I've lost my wife and cannot find her, where-
ever I 
may go, 
• 
At first she robbed me of my heart, and now 
she's flown from me, 
And taken all my furniture wherever can she be; 
CHORUS. 
Perhaps she's on the railway with a 
swell so 
fair, 
Perhaps she's up in a 
baloon flying through the 
air, 
Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive, perhaps 
she's on the sea, 
Perhaps she's crone to Brigham Young a 
Mot 
to be. 
Fif 
read so much of Mormonites, of nothing 
else she'd talk, 
at 
nd with a 
sanctified young chap, each day 
she used to walk, 
• 
14 
She said he was a 
Mormon saint from far 
across the sea, 
I 
have not seen her for a 
week wherever can 
she be? 
Perhaps she's, & c. 
She can't respect the marriage rows, 
that 
truthfully she swore, 
I 
only hope her Mormon spouse has fifty wives 
or more, 
1 
hope he'll thrash :her ev'ry night, when he 
comes home to tea, 
I 
hope they'll always row and fight wherever 
they may be. 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
I 
hope she'll have a 
lot of hungry squalling 
brats to keep, 
1 
hope they'll cry all night, and never let her go 
to sleep, 
I 
hope her chimneys all may smoke, her lodgers 
never pay, 
knd German bands and organ men annoy her 
all the day. 
Perhaps she's, &c., 
15 
If she s 
in the railway train, I 
hope that it will 
smash, 
If up in a 
baloon I 
hope she'll fall out with a 
crash, 
If on the road to the Salt Lake, I 
hope she may 
get drowned, 
Then I 
will get another wife and quickly I'll be 
bound. 
Perhaps she's, &c.

IN THE BOWERY. 
TONY PI..n.otes Great Sensational Song. 
AIR.—" Piccadilly." 
[This song has been called for nightly for Months 
in succession, having been sung by Mr. PASTOR in his 
own inimitable style, and been received with atm-
ders of applause. 
OME say that Central Park's the place, 
For fun of every kind; 
Dn Broadway and Fifth Avenue 
Much pleasure others,find. 
But I'm a 
different sort of a 
chap 
No fun in that I 
see, 
For when I 
want enjoyment 
The Bowery for me. 
Spoken.—Yes, you may talk about your 
Broadway belles, your Fifth Avenue swells, 
your exquisitely-dressed creatures, with their 
4101.1160 
17 
lavender kids, and their la-de-da's, now, what 
do they know about enjoyment? They are 
afraid to go in for a 
little fun for fear of disar-
ranging their toilets; and then what would Mrs. 
Grundy say? " Charles Frederick Augustus is 
getting decidedly vulgar; Seraphina Emelia is 
positively shocking!" 
But here in the Bowery 
people enjoy themselves just when they feel like 
it. 
They don't care a 
curse what others may 
say, for that's the custom. 
CHORUS. 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
For beautiful girls with bright eyes and dark 
curls, 
In the flowery, in the Bowery, 
That's where - reside when I'm home. 
No butterflies of fashion there, 
Or idlers may be found, 
But men with open hearth and hands. 
With honest labor browned; 
18 
lien who to help a 
friend in need, 
Would their last dollar lend, 
Who never live on other folks, 
But earn the cash they spend. 
Spoken. — Yes, there Is no place in tne Bow-
ery tor those well-dressed corner statues to try 
to look like 
millionaire's sons, while their 
mothers are out scrubbing for a 
dollar a 
day to 
support them in idleness. 
A fellow nas no 
business on the east side of town unless he 
wants to work and earn his own living. 
What 
fortune is there more honorable than that of a 
working men. 
There was Washington, he was 
a 
farmer, and Franklin a 
printer. Warren a 
doc-
tor. 
Andy Johnson a 
tailor. 
Abe Lincoln 
a 
rail-splitter, and Grant a tanner. 
If you 
want to see men who make our country great, 
who add to her wealth, develop her resources, 
maintain her strength and prosperity, you will 
always find them— 
In the Bowery, &c. 
19 
The other da'y a 
well-dressed fop, 
While walking through the street, 
Insulted a 
poor working girl 
With whom he chanced to meet 
A 
young mechanic came along, 
And heard the words he said, 
He soon pitched in to the fop 
And on him put a 
head. 
Spoken. — Yes, hb laid the cownrdly rascal 
out. " Now," he says, " git up and git, and 
if ever I 
catch you insulting a 
female again I'll 
add a 
French roof to that head I've put on you. 
The dandy quietly sneaked away: the young 
lady turned to her preserver, with tears in her 
eyes, and said; " My dear sirA how can I 
ever 
thank you for the kindness which you have 
shown me in protecting me from the insults of 
that ruffian and I 
hope sir, we shall meet again. 
Do you live near here ? Certainly, young lady. 
I'm always found— 
In the Bowery, &c, 
20 
When dark rebellion raised its head, 
And war o'er spread the land, 
When rushed unto Columbia's aid 
Each gallant hero band, 
Among the foremost on the field, 
Amid the battle's noise, 
Upholding still our starry flag; 
Was found the Bowery boys 
Spoken. — When the call came for soldiers in 
the hour of danger, the Bowery was the first to 
send its volunteers, and nobly did they do their 
duty. 
Who does not remember that incident 
at the battle of Antietam, when the enemy 
charged in full force, one brave regiment brave-
ly stood its ground, under a 
terrific fire and 
changed the tide of seeming defeat to one of 
glorious victory. 
This was noticed by Genera! 
McClellan, who exclaimed; " What regim 
is this?" " New York Volunteers," was the 
answer. " Where do they hail from ? "

CRIME. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
firE been thinking of late, I've been think 
ino• 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries Old Uncle Sam, it's a "poser," 
There's something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our lan& 
i'm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sir, 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
ifiuldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by night and by day; 
V 
idle you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
tour gold to yourself you confine, 
22 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
. 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, sir, 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole lot. sir 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, sir, 
And still you wonaer at crime. 
Can you wonder at crime, can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinning, 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch him they say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
He defies a 
whole police division, 
While the poor man is sent off to prison, 
And still, you wonder at crime. * 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
How the poor of our land they are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god-send for them to get bread; 
k 
23 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
To our prisons then go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoardings of gold. 
A 
little would soon break asunder, 
The chains the poor sufferer is under, • 
Go, list to that great voice of hunger, 
And you'll never more wonder at crime..

JAMSETJHEE 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
3
 
UST like Sinbad the Sailor, 
7 ' 
Or Robinson Crusoe— 
I 
left my native land, in search 
Of wonders I 
would go: 
I 
went to be a 
sailor— 
I 
came back as you see, 
A mixture of an Indian, 
A Turk and Chimpanzee. 
CHORUS. 
Jamsetjhee, ,ma 
jabajehoy, 
Jabbery Dobie Porie 
Ikey, Pikey, Sikey, Crikey, 
We'd been to sea a 
fortnight, 
A 
dreadful storm arose: 
Upon an island I 
was thrown, 
To wind and rain exposed, 
27 
By savages surrounded: 
(It was their island home,) 
They addressed me in alanguage, 
Decidedly their own. 
Jamsetjhee, &c. 
I 
expected from these savages, 
Less pence than kicks and blows: 
They'd a 
funny dress, in fact they'd not 
A 
single stitch of clothes. 
They tore my things from off my back, 
My hair from out the roots, 
They left me with a 
waistcoat, 
A 
hat and pair of boots. 
Jamsetjhee, &c. 
When they got all my clothing, 
Thinks I: what next they'll do ? 
They brought their paint and painted me, 
With colors red and blue— 
And so that was my costume: 
A waistcoat for my clothes, 
Striped red and. blue, a 
hat and boots, 
And a 
ring stuck through my nose. 
Jamsetjhee, &c. 
YIN  
28 
For five years in that costume, 
I 
roamed about the land: 
To a 
damsel of the royal-blood 
They made me give my hand: 
And there were great rejoicings, 
Upon the wedding day, 
And we've got two pairs of black kids, 
My wife bas taught to say: 
Jamsetihee, 
One day a 
ship appeared in sight, 
I'd scarce believe it trne— 
To reach the ship I 
stole a 
boat, 
And paddled my own canoe. 
But now I'm back in Merrikey, 
The country I 
adore— 
I'll take good care to stick to it— 
And never leave it more. 
Jamsetjhee, Eoc.

LOVE AND PRIDE. 
Comic Medley Duet. 
Sang by JENNIE ENGEL and TONY PARTOB. 
TONY. 
ND SO, 
Miss, you mean to deceive me, 
Your promises all would you break; 
Do you think it is kind thus to. 
grieve me, 
When you know I 
would die for your sake? 
I 
don't ask yOu to live upon pottage, 
Or anything mean, 'pon my word. 
JENNIE. 
The idea of love in a 
cottage 
Is decidedly very absurd. 
TONY. 
There's some soldiers away in the village close 
by, 
I'll go and enlist; in the wars I 
will die 
Like a 
warrior bold, and the storryou'll hear 
That your Tony he died like a 
brave cavalier. 
30 
80 make up your mind, Miss, as " so 
as you 
can, 
And take me for better for worse, " I'm the 
man." --
To render you happy as happy can be, 
If not to the wars, I'll go over the sea. 
JENNIE. 
Don't talk of marriage, 
Unless in a 
carriage, 
To church you can take me and make me your 
wife. 
You have not a 
shilling. 
TONY. 
Then wretched I 
be all the days, 
of my life, 
My sorrows I'll bury 
Become military, 
Enlist for a 
soldier, and off to the wars. 
JENNIE. 
Make haste—be going, 
Your valor be showing; 
But you'll never do so. 
81 
TONY. 
Why not? 
JENNIE. 
Because you must march, march, come right 
about, face this way. 
TONY. 
Yes, march, march, for one and a 
penny a 
day. 
JENNIE. 
March, march, come right about, face this 
way; 
After you face, 
Right about face, 
Off, off, and away. 
TONY. 
Good-bye, Jennie, dear, I'm oft now in a 
crack, 
ill go and be a 
warrior, 
You'll never see me back ? 
This is the last time you'll look upon Bill; 
I 
go to fight the foe and fight against my 
will. 
JENNIE. 
Don't be so provoking, I 
was only joking. 
4 
83 
32 
TONY. 
Then it's very cruel, for with grief I'm neat 
choking, 
You mean to wed with me, then? 
How h.apriy I 
shall be, then; 
I'll never be a 
soldier if you'll'inarry me; 
Oh, 1.11 stay at home, I 
never will roam. 
'JENNIE. 
'Twould be very wrong if you to do so. 
, 
TONY. 
I 
might stick on an island, 
And never see dry land, 
Like a 
second young Robinson Crusoe. 
JENNIE. 
Never mind Robinson Crusoe. 
TONY. 
No, because I 
love yOu so, 
You shall be my than Friday, 
And keep my house tidy; 
What

HAD been dining rather late, • 
The fact I 
think it best to state, 
When I 
strolled out without a 
mate, 
One very pleasant evening; . 
By fancy's bent my steps were led, 
As westward through the streets I 
sped, 
A 
lovely figure saw ahead, 
Walked fast and said " Good-evening.". 
I 
felt a 
disappointed dunce 
No word she answered in response, 
So I 
repeated more than once, 
" 
Good-evening, miss, good-evening;" 
At length she turned her head this way, 
Judge if you can of my dismay, 
She's fifty-five if she's a 
day, 
I 
blurted out, " Good-evening." 
The disappointment made me queer, 
I 
turned I 
op7tbliènear, 
Addressed the bar-maid thus, " My dear, 
A 
bitter beer, good-evening;" 
VVith ti6arkling eyes 'arid Me sc;on Served, 
What is it makes me so tmnerved, 
Close standing by me I 
observed 
My tailor, whorsaid, " Gciod-evening.." 
His presence spoilt my wish to stay,. 
I

"Please -

Good-evening, sir, good-evening;" 
"Pray pardon, me I 
beg of yoU,

quite forgot," and that was true, 
The tailor said, " Yon often do, 
Good-evening,"gr„ good-evening." 
I

In such a

Policeman ten outAde the door, 
Increased my misery more and more, 
He said, " I've seen your game before, 
Get off my beat, good-evening, sir, good-even-

I 
left his beat, it didn't suit, 
To argue with that stupid brute, 
Or hear him echo the salute, 
" 
Good-evening, sir, good evening.' 
Into a 
court I 
made dive, 
A 
fresh street reached more dead than alive, 
Again I 
met Miss Fifty-five, who Simpered out, 
" 
Good-evening, sir, good-evening." 
Things mostly happen for the best, 
If you're amused, I'll waive the rest, 
And with me enjoy the jest. 
At my expense this evening; 
But luckily I 
am here 
Where I 
have naught to fear, 
And so with kind regards to all frienda, 
I 
beg to say, " good-evening."

A. Starry Night for a Ramble 
As sung by Gus Williams.

little boating 
To pull against the stream. 
But of all the games that I 
love best 
To fill me with delight, 
I 
like to take a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night 
CHORUS 
A 
starry night for a 
ramble, 
In a 
flow'ry dell, 
Through the bush and bramble 
Kiss and never tell. 
Talk about your bathing 
Or strolling on the sands, 
Or some unseen verandah 
Where gentle zephyr fans, 
Or rolling home in the morning boys 
And very nearly tight, 
Could never beat a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night.

Down in a 
Coal Mine. 
AM a 
jovial collier lad, 
As blithe as blithe can be; 
For let the times be good or bad, 
They're all the same to me; 
'Tis little of the world I 
know, 
And care less for its ways; 
For where the dog-star never glows, 
I 
wear away my days. 
C 
HORUS. 
Down in a 
coal mine, underneath the ground, 
Where a gleam of sunshine never can be 
found; 
Digging 
dusky 
diamonds all the season 
round, 
Down in a coal 
mine, 
underneath 
the 
ground.

My hands are horny, hard and black 
With working in the vein; 
And, like the clothes upon ray back, 
My speech is rough and plain: 
Well, if I 
stubble with my tongue, 
I've one excuse to say— 
Tis not the collier's heart that's wrong, 
'Tis the head that goes astray. 
Down in a 
coal mine, &c. 
At every shift, be't soon or late, 
I 
haste my bread to earn, 
And anxiously my kindred wait, 
And wrtch ior my return: 
For death, that lovcis all alike, 
Whate er their rank may be, 
Amid the fire and damp may strike, 
And fling his carts at me. 
Down in a 
coai mine, &c. 
r44 
Wow little do the great ones care— 
Who sit at home secure— 
What bidden dangers colliers dare, 
What hardships they endure! 
The very fires their mansions boast 
To cheer themselves and wives, 
Nayhap were kindled at the cost 
Of jovial collier's lives. 
Down in a 
coal mine, &c. 
Then cheer up, lads, and make ye mudl 
Of every joy ye can: 
But let your mirth be always such 
As best becomes a 
man: 
However fortune turns about, 
We'll still be jovial souls, 
For what would nations be without 
The lads that look for coals?

Mistake. 
As Sung by Gus Williams. 
OME folks think they're awfully

That all other folks are but fools, 
Some people will often endeavor, 
To make other people their tools.

And fancy they're well wide awake. 
That none are so deep or so cute as 
themselves. 
That's where they make the mistake.

ROSA— 
They keep me at it all day long, 
First with dance and then with song, 
Its no use talking, you can see, 
They can't let this Darkie be. 
Sam. Stop that music. 
Rosa. Let me be, 
Don't you see it tickles me. 
Sam. First its heel and then its toe. 
Rosa. Yes, I'm always on the go. 
Both. White folks, don't you pity me, 
They can't let this Darkie be. 
SAM— 
I'm in love with Rosa fair, 
She picks cotton over there, 
Her nose is frat and her lips hang down, 
She's the prettiest girl in town.

When we out a-walking go, t 
The Darkies they do stare us so,. 
This it is that troubles me, 
They can't let this Darkie be.

T'other night while at the ban, 
The Darkies all, both great and small, 
Then it was I 
had no care, 
I 
was with my Rosa fair.

The Darkies they did dance and sing, 
They made the bones and banjo ring, 
Then 'twas up with Sam and me, 
They couldn't let this Darkie .be.

If Ever i 
Cease to Love. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS with great 
applause. 
Music published by White & GouHand 
Boston, Mass. 
N a 
street way over in Weehawken, 
And. where there's a 
plank road, 
There stands a 
neat little frame house 
Which is my true love's abode 
I 
go there to see my Mary Jane, 
She is my turtle dove, 
61,vearing on my bended knee, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
Taking my oath, just like a 
fool, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love; 
May the moon be turned into greeem 
cheese, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May I 
have to live on red hair hash, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May all the seas, be turned to ink, 
May " spooney's" eyes get straight, 
May conductors never knock down a 
cent, 
May I 
gold watches hate; 
May cows lay eggs, ducks give milk, 
May an elephant turn to a 
dove, 
.iray I 
be stuffed. with sausage meat, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May each old maid be blessed with 
twins, 
If over I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May I 
know how it is myself, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May I 
know how the old thing works, 
If ever I 
cease love. 
If ever I 
cease to love 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
if I 
ever cease to love, 
May policemen club no more little boys, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
She can sing, she can play the piano. 
She can hop, she can skip, she can run, 
She's of good breeding and manners, 
And the best little girl under the sun; 
Now who could. not love such a 
beauty, 
For she is one, 
by Jove. 
lgay I 
be stung to death with flies, 
If ever I 
cease to love; 
May all the streets be paved with gold, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
If ever I

If ever I

May little dogs wag their tails in front, 
If ever I

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
HUIVIPTYDUMPTY! 
IT PLEASES OLD AND YOUNG. 
With directions so plain that, any person 
can become an adept. 
Read what a 
Leading Journal says of it: 
' 
An ingenious little book of the thaum a-
turgic order has been sent us, called "IIIDIPTY 
DUMPTY," and bound in such a 
way as to dye 
opportunity for a 
decided puzzling tack. 
While presenting the ordinary appearance of a 
child's picture book, gayly printed and col-
ored, it is so bound that a 
practised manipu-
lator taking it up and flirting the leaves rap-
idly over, can make it appear to be filled with 
copies of only one picture, or with blank pages 
or wiih any one of quite a 
succession of fig-
ures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly 
thumbed, appears to contain nothingbut por-
traits of Harlequin in his tesselated suit; the 
.4' 
I, 
next, only Columbine; then, nothingbut Pan-
taloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistopheles. 
A 
little practice and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at borne in 
the handling of it."—Philad. Evening Bulletin.
