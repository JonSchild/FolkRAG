Harvy Ortiz interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 25, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company 
Plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: Today is Tuesday, May 25th, 2021. This is an interview for the occupational 
history archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, funded by the 
Archie Green Fellowship. As part of this project, I am interviewing cement workers in the 
Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry in the United 
States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the 
Library of Congress. I am Vyta Pivo and today I'm speaking with Harvy Ortiz at the Lehigh 
Cement Company Nazareth Plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm, you, give 
me your permission to record the interview, is that correct?  
 
Harvy Ortiz: Yes, I did.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much. Could you tell me your full name, your year of birth, and where 
you were born?  
 
HO: 
Well, my full name is Harvy Enres Ortiz Valencia. I was born in 1988; 1988 in 
Columbia. 
 
VP: 
Where in Colombia? 
 
HO: 
In a small town in the Department of Cauca, it’s called Cartago.   
 
VP: 
Is that where you grew up?  
 
HO: 
I was born and raised there, yeah. Then I moved when I was 17 to Pereda, where I 
went to college, to the Universidad Technologico [unclear].  
 
VP: 
What did you study there? 
 
HO: 
Uh, professional chemist, industrial chemistry. So, I went there for five years and it’s 
funny because I wanted to be a doctor, but, I had to take a test and my score wasn't high 
enough to be a doctor. So, they say, like, you cannot be the doctor, so you can pick any of the 
engineers. So, I decided to go with chemistry and it's been fun.  
 
VP: 
And how did you discover the cement industry?  
 
[00:02:14] 
 
HO: 
Oh my gosh, it's a funny story. I never thought that I was going to be in this industry. 
When I was in college, by the end of my career in college, we were busier. And, you know, in 
the last semester, we dedicated the last semester just to visit different companies, different 
industries. And in Colombia, there is Argus, Argus Cement. So, we visited Argus Cement in 
Cali over there. And by that time, it was the wet process. So, I have some memories, but I 
know much about it. You know, it was a big, big process and never, never got into the details. 
2 
 
And then I never thought that I was going to work in the industry. But I always feel blessed 
of being a chemist because I knew that I was going to have a role in any company, any field, 
you know, it has a big spectrum to work with. So, I got out of college and I worked for a 
company that makes colors. It was very interesting. And then I, I don't know, usually kind of 
came off very fast between companies. So, then I went to work for another company, that 
makes tissue paper, everything there is tissue paper; another beautiful process. Most of the 
production was done from recycled paper. And then I ended up running a refinery from 
ethanol, used to make ethanol from sugar cane.  
So, then I met my wife and we decided to come here to the United States. And I never 
thought that I was going to work in the cement business because I had a lot of expertise in 
making ethanol from sugarcane. And since we have a lot of refineries here, I thought that was 
the easier [industry] to link with. But then once I arrived here, I bought a house here in the 
area and just driving to my house, I saw the Keystone. I was like, “oh, this looks interesting 
to me.” And I come in. Before that I didn't look for a job because I was assigned the language 
of my English, I wasn't great. I don't think it's great yet, but I'm still learning. But yeah, I 
wasn't able to communicate very well, so one of the first things that I had to do when I 
arrived here to the United States just to get involved in a community college. I was there for a 
year and when I felt ready to explain to people what I know to do so, I say I was going to 
apply for a job. So, the day I saw that big kiln, the preheater. I didn’t see Nazareth first, I 
would have applied here first, but I was driving from the other side and I saw Keystone. And 
I stopped by just to see the name of the company. And that night I opened my laptop and I 
applied for a job there. There was not a jobs. Um, but I saw the HR manager contact there. 
So, I sent my resume, they call me next day for an interview. And the same week I went for 
an interview, uh, it was it was a nice interview. They like my profile, they liked what I had 
done by that time. And they didn't they were not looking for a job. But they say, um, 
something like, uh, we are not looking for anyone, but we just cannot let you go. We would 
like to work with you. So, they kind of create a job for me that they. 
 
VP: 
What was the job? 
 
HO: 
It was just like a mix between process engineering and working in the lab, as well as a 
manager in the lab assistant. So, I was a coordinator to the lab, but, I always thought and I 
told, “I’m process engineer, that's what I do know how to do better.” In all my life, I had been 
working as a process engineer. My strongest skills are to improve processes, you know, make 
them more efficient and environmentally friendly, you know, so is what I always done. So, I 
say they want they want me to work in the lab. I say, “I can work anywhere,” you know, “I 
can work in the lab, but it's going to be boring for me. I like to be solving problems or 
looking how to make things better.” So, they say, “oh, no worries. You do work two or three 
days in the lab and then or two days in the field as a process engineer, how do you want to 
do?? I say, “OK, that's fine.”  
 
VP: 
So, when did you start working at Keystone?  
 
[00:08:15] 
 
HO: 
So, I said working on Keystone in 2017, I believe. Yeah, 2017. Um, so I feel like I 
didn't know anything about cement when I started there. Uh, just the very common, you 
know, the rock, the kind of rock, the process in general, how they burn the rock. Um, but 
once I start working there, I just I don't know. I just think I just did what I always do. Uh, I 
love learning and I learn the business as well as much as possible. And there was a lot of 
3 
 
books. I was lucky there was a library there. So, I read a lot of books and I learn all the details 
and I think I've become good at it. And, uh, and sometimes and it's just fun, you know. There 
is, I got a lot of admiration for my colleagues, some of them, you know, very senior 
gentlemen who have been in this business for 40, 50 years. I have a lot of friends in this 
business now and a lot of admiration from there. And I've done business with a lot of people 
already. And so, sometimes, you know, when you are young, the people that has been in this 
business for so many years, they look at you like you don't have enough experience, you 
know? That's one side of the coin, but on the other side, there is people that recognize like 
“this kid is so small, it doesn't matter if he has two years experience. He already proved what 
he knows about this business,” you know? So, it's like I saw my friend say, OK, this 
gentleman has thirty years experience, but that means nothing to me because it could be that 
whatever he has been doing in the thirty years is wrong. It's always he has been wrong. So, it 
could be that a person that he has only two years is doing the right thing and it doesn't mean, 
you know?  
So, anyway, it was fun. I learned a lot at Keystone. I learned a lot, but I got to this 
point, where I was used to. In the past, I was used to, I just started, it was a short career in my 
last experience before coming to the cement industry, I was running a refinery. I was a plant 
manager of a refinery making ethanol. And I started there as a project engineer of the 
fermentation process. Very quickly, I moved up to the supervision process, you know, and I 
did, uh, a series of improvements, you know, maybe ten improvements that are safe, uh, very 
significant. Uh, money to the company becomes the plant very, very efficient, you know, uh, 
reusing all the cost and making it more friendly with the environment. So, during my career, I 
been used to have ideas and implement those ideas because it’s just, it is to me not something 
that are trial and error, it is something that I’m putting numbers and doing my energy and 
balances. And I think if numbers, you know, numbers don't lie, not if the numbers are there. 
If I have a project, we can review it together and I will make sure it's going to work, you 
know? 
 
VP: 
So how can that previous experience of manufacturing helped you work in the cement 
industry?  
 
[00:12:23] 
 
HO: 
Oh, my God, experience is really important, you know? And you when you are in 
college, you learn a lot, but there is a gap between theory and reality. You know, but the 
theory help you to understand the process better. And there is a lot of things that you can 
apply and experience in the other process, as you know, I knew. So, I didn't know how was 
the cement process, but I was an expert in energy mass balances, heat exchanged, and I know 
how to run big equipment and I know how to run big ideas fans or the kind of pumps or 
models. So, I knew how to calculate [unclear] efficiencies, pump efficiencies, you know, and 
there is also so many analogies that you can do from one business to another. You know, it's 
just the science behind is the same, is the math behind the conversions, the [unclear], you 
know, it's just the same math, the same science behind.  
So, I was at Keystone when I learned about it all. I knew all the potential that the 
company had. And I wanted to do a lot of things, but I didn't feel like I had the backup to do 
it because I was new. And in less than two years, they promote me three times there. But they 
still, they didn't give me, like, let me do my job, like, I want to do this, you know, but I don't 
know how I felt by that time. So, I just got a little bit bored because I wanted to do more and I 
was feeling like I wasn't doing enough. And I think that's one of my characteristics, is like I'm 
like a proactive. I mean, I like to be efficient and I like to keep moving, you know, every day. 
4 
 
So, I just decided to go to I say, “you know, I'm going to look for another job. I got bored 
here. Maybe I'm going to a refinery or something.” So, one of my friends that has been a long 
time in this industry say, “no, no, no, no, no, we cannot let you go.” You should interview my 
friend, too – he will be happy. Oh, so he's like a “no, no, no. We need people like you in this 
industry. We cannot let you go.” He gave me a very nice recommendation letter the other 
day. The HR manager from Keystone did, too, because I had planned to go to the Lehigh 
University to start my MBA. So, I had two nice recommendation letters. Uh, so I was trying 
to get a job in a refinery. My friend say “no, let's do this.” You just want to go to another 
company. So, he put me in contact with another person, like a recruiter. And they offered me 
two jobs, one in Texas and one in California. And California has always been a dream, you 
know, to me, I think for everybody wants to go to California. I say I say, “oh, I always 
wanted to go to California.” So, I went to California with Lehigh Hanson as a quality 
manager. And it was super fun. Uh, the whole experience was great.  
 
VP: 
How many years did you spend there? 
 
HO: 
Um, almost three years from, eighteen months from, so, I went there in 2019, and uh, 
I was there 2019 and 2020. I came here last year.  
 
VP: 
And how was the work different in California from what you did at Keystone.  
 
[00:16:35] 
 
HO: 
Keystone, oh it was better because I felt my job being appreciated a lot. And even 
though most of the people were so old-timers, but they were so smart. And I think when 
people are so smart, they are able to appreciate who's smart as well, you know, and they feel 
happy to have an intelligent person being part of their team. So, uh, and in California, people 
were more, they have I think they have more ownership with the company because they have 
been so long with the company, and they have made a good amount of money with the 
company. So, I got to meet some elements, all of them, you know, have a good network that 
they built through the years thanks to the company. So, they feel very grateful to the company 
and they were glad to see good people and they were smart people. So, I was explaining to 
them my projects and what I wanted to do. And they agreed with and they were happy to see 
me there. They were really hard when I had to live. So, and I had the opportunity in 
California to do all the departments, so when I hired there in quality, I was like, OK, I said, I 
can do this job, I can be the quality manager, but I will be watching the kiln as well. You 
know, I say the quality depends on the process. If you don't run well, the process, how you 
can achieve good quality, you know, it doesn’t make sense. So, I say I will watch the kiln as 
well. I have to do to make sure we make good quality. So, I always been in the in the both 
sides, you know, is like here, I am the quality manager here. We just joke around, I say you 
have it easy you know, because here I'm running the kiln so I know what the quality people 
like to say, you know, and, and of course like we all like to see, you know, we, we make good 
quality, our customers are happy and it's just good for everybody, you know? We build the 
structures that are going to last longer.  
 
VP: 
So, you came to Lehigh in 2020? 
 
HO: 
Here? Yeah, November 2020, I came here to Nazareth, but I was already working for 
Lehigh, I was just transferred here. So, my wife didn't like California. I loved it. So, she 
because she, she was right in this area. Born in New York, raised in this area, so all her 
5 
 
family lives here, so she wanted to come back. I say, OK, let's go back. So, I talked to Lehigh 
in the beginning of 2020 and I say I have to go back to Pennsylvania. So, I was so lucky, they 
oh, we need you here, what can we do for you to stay one year more or less. So, I said well I 
put out several conditions. Lehigh has been good with me so I like I needed to come every 
month for vacation time and they cover all my expenses. And it was a good agreement. So, I 
decided to stay one more year in California and they say, don't worry, by the end of the year 
we will transfer you to one of our sister plans. So, they were looking how to transfer me. 
Then, by the end of the year, I say, I remember that I was going back to Pennsylvania, you 
know? I would like to stay with Lehigh but if there is no opportunity to be transferred, I will 
just go. You know, I have to go by eventually. Everything worked out very well. They say, 
no, no worries. And in November, they say, oh, that is the kiln engineer position open, will 
you be interested. And I said, sure, yeah. That's what that's what I like to do. That's my 
favorite position.  
 
VP: 
So, can you tell me a bit about what do you do in your work? What is the job and 
what does your workday look like? 
 
[00:21:20] 
 
HO: 
So, I just interact with a lot of people, I have a lot of meetings, I interact with a lot of 
people, and I think 80 percent of my time is spent learning and coaching people. I have read a 
lot of books and I know I have learned a lot about this process. So, for me, it's important for 
people to understand what we are doing and what we are doing in the way we want to do it, 
you know? For me, it's important for people to understand how cement is made, when and 
how can we make it efficiently. I like people to be aware of all the concerns we have, the 
environmental challenges. And so there is something that always caught my attention, you 
know? I came from a Third World country and I had the opportunity to work in some 
multinational companies there, you know, and they run very efficiently. It's just amazing, you 
know? But there are big differences, of course. You know, the unemployment rates are way 
higher there, you know? So, the companies there has some kind of luxury, you know, is how 
I see that. Even the people that clean, they have the greatest education, you know? So, this 
place is run very, very well. And the way they manage, you know, because they because the 
capability of hiring people, good people all the time. So, the way they manage it is very 
straight line. Like, for example, I had to do for improvements every two quarters in order to 
keep my job, you know, like I had to do an environmental improvement.  
 
VP: 
This is in Colombia? 
 
HO: 
Yeah, I had to do the safety improvement, you know, so we become very safety, you 
know, everybody was looking for ergonomic regs and biometrics, biological regs. You know, 
you have to do an improvement in safety. You had to do an improvement on environmental 
in all the fields, you know, for improvements every quarter. So, everybody was challenged to 
improve every day. So, when I come here, uh, I always say, oh my God, I can hardly believe 
how this business has been running for so long, you know. And this company, they look we 
look like a mess, you know? 
 
VP: 
In what way? 
 
[00:24:10] 
 
6 
 
HO: 
It's like a mess, it's just dusty and dirty everywhere, you know? And we have been in 
this business for over a hundred years. You know, we hear from 1800, from coal kilns, wet 
process. You know, you saw that in the machine. We had a lot of history here in 
Pennsylvania where one of the places where this business started. And I just, you know, uh 
and we saw running plants are still running. But I think people, most of the people in the 
cement business, you know, but I mean by the labor people, by the union, they don't have 
enough training or enough knowledge. And I can pull any labor or any person from the union, 
you know, I guarantee you I can go to any plant, any plant and pick a random person from the 
union and they won't be able to explain how we make cement. You know, so people, most of 
these companies, they just hired laborers, you know, give a little bit of training on major 
equipment. This is this, this is this, go clean there, go clean there. And people start working 
and they work hard, you know? They are hard workers, but they just don't work in an 
efficient manner, you know, and they become part of the culture. They think because, you 
know, because the cement business is a dirty, they call it a dirty industry. So, they think that 
being dirty is normal. No, we are dirty because we are not efficient. You know, we are not 
fixing what needs to be fixed, but is no reason to be dirty anywhere, everywhere.  
So, at Keystone, that was one the things that happened, you know, so I come from a 
country where I used to be so efficient and I see so much inefficiencies that is just driving me 
crazy, you know? I couldn't handle it like a no. I came from a refinery, where we were 
supposed to produce a 100 thousand gallons of oil a month. We were producing 110, you 
know, like we were like a 99.999 over a hundred. Like, we couldn't even, you know, we were 
so efficient. We were almost recovering all the ethanol, you know, in the bottom of the oil 
distillation columns. It was just way it was supposed to be, you know, being energy efficient. 
And I come here with a cement plant that has a capacity of 1.1 million a year and the most 
that we can produce is 600 thousand. So, I was like, God, this is just, you know.  
 
VP: 
And you brought this new kind of perspective, or new set of values. How did the 
companies respond?   
 
HO: 
Uh, it was really difficult. They used to have a production manager that was really 
hard to work with, and he ended up resigning. And I think, um, you know, the world has a 
huge challenge in all kinds of industries, you know, especially I think here mostly. So, this is 
how I see, you know, my personal point of view. But we have a lot of managers, you know, 
people have a lot of bosses, but we really do have few, few leaders, you know? It's hard to 
find leaders. And I think leaders can be created and educated, you know, but I think most of 
them are born with those skills. That's how I feel. Um, I don't know. I feel like I feel one of 
them and I keep learning and reading to improve my skills, you know? There are many books 
that they do help even when sometimes you identify yourself when you are in there. But they 
still, you know. 
 
VP: 
What's the most helpful book that you can think of? 
 
[00:28:40] 
 
HO: 
I recently received from Maxwell, one of my favorite books is like How to Win 
Friends and Influence People. That's a great one. So, but yeah, sometimes this is this is very 
critical, you know, because I think any person because I don't, I think any person can do any 
job if it's properly trained, no matter what job, you know? I’ve done it in the past, many 
times, and I did it at Keystone again. So, I was managing the lab, I talked to the HR manager, 
and I say, you know, I made this friend when I was studying English, you know, my friend, 
7 
 
one of my best friends here. We came at the same time. He's from Syria, right? I'm from 
Colombia. We met in college with the same purpose, learn English. We both were there 
paying to learn and we become friends because he caught my attention, how he being from 
Syria, I'm from Colombia and how we can think alike, you know, like I couldn't believe it 
was just so strange to me. Like, this guy is just like my brother and we are so far and we just 
think like, you know, so we become friends. He was working somewhere else, working really 
hard. And, you know, there are people that have skills to do better jobs than just working 
hard. Anyway, so I called the HR manager, and I say, I need this guy here. We need a person. 
And I think he, he never been in this business, but I'm pretty sure if I trained him, he will be 
able to do this job. They gave me the opportunity and he was still there, you know, and I’m 
trying to bring him over here now.  
 
VP: 
Wow, that’s amazing! It was am immigrant business to begin with, and now it seems 
pretty American and very white.  
 
[00:30:47] 
 
HO: 
Yeah. But yeah, it's because, ah, I think it's been a white job because for a long period 
of time, because I think unions, you know, before they were just allowed to hire the 
employees that were relatives of employees. And I don't think anymore and also it used to be 
one of the best paid jobs in the area. That’s not anymore [the case]. And it’s a hard job, you 
know, it's a hard job. And we've had areas where is it's risky to work.  
So, on this, let's go back. So, yeah, what happened is that there is a gap, I think, where 
we need more leadership between the operators and the managers thing, right? Here, and I 
think we got a great, great team here. So, some plants had a lack of leadership, right? And 
what I see is more lack of conveying the knowledge. So, let's say the management team has 
the, is supposed to have more knowledge because we run the business, you know. But the 
hard task is to convey all that information to the operators because they are who are 
physically running the business, you know, and that's my job. So, answering your question, 
that's my job. I coached the operators who runs the kiln and they are running the heart of this 
business, which is the kiln. If the kiln is down, we are down. So, the kiln is the heart of this 
business, the most important piece of equipment. And here I am doing what I like the most 
because I feel like I control the major process. Um, and I'm very good with indicators and 
with math. I'm very competitive, but like with myself, you know. I always try to be the best at 
what I do. It doesn't matter what I do, you know, where I go. I want to I want to put a 
difference, you know, like this is before me, this is after me, you know? So, I coordinate all 
the activities with maintenance, refractory, everything that is involved with the kiln 
operation. And I make sure that all the jobs are done properly and the way how to. So, I 
inspect equipment. I make sure that that we are set to run well and then I talk to the operators 
to make sure we are running how we are supposed to run because the equipment can get 
broken because by operation, but also there is [unclear] and some other kinds of conditions. 
You know, modern equipment here [unclear], uh, I forgot the word, how to pronounce it. If 
you know modern equipment is the environment conditions, some raining. So, things get 
worn down. So, but it it's amazing. So, the operators are, imagine this. So, we got those kids 
to run the most important piece of equipment, you know, where every single thing that you 
look at is expensive, you know? We spend millions and everything in refractory and [unclear] 
and everything that has to be with the kiln is expensive and the force to get it done and the 
materials are expensive.  
So, and then our we get the labor force, right? So, everybody starts as a labor in the 
union sometimes because they lack, because they lack of personnel. So, we promote these 
8 
 
guys very, you know, usually in, um, like on a normal [unclear], you know, you would like to 
hire a labor and stay there for quite few time. Then, move to another position and, you know, 
until he gets to know all the business in a few years and then maybe move him to the most 
important job in the plant. But sometimes you don't have the time to do that. You know, like 
most of the operators, operators that we have here in the control room, they were labor just a 
few months before, you know? They don't have any technical background, any college 
education, they never knew anything about this business before. They were just hired as a 
labor and learning and now they are running the most important piece of equipment, you 
know? And I was and I, you know, at the end of the day, I admire them, I don’t blame them, I 
don’t judge them. I was like, guys, you are doing amazing because you don't even understand 
what you are doing and you are doing it like, you know, it's just it blows my mind. I was like, 
you don't even know what’s happening in there and they are controlling it, like, it used to 
make sense. You know how you can control something that you understand what was 
happening there? And is how this business has been running for so many years. This is why 
we had so many failures, so many breakdowns, so many inefficiencies, you know, but I think 
we are moving in the right direction. Things, good things take time, you know, it’s a process 
little-by-little. We have seen a lot of improvements in in such a short period of time. And but 
people are so smart, you know. So, I go to the to the operators. I say, look, if you look at this 
temperature, it will tell you how hot is in there, you know, and then the nobs it's also an 
indicator of how hard you are in there, you know, so now they are looking at nobs and they 
are looking at this temperature. You know, the next day I go and say, hey, the chemistry is 
important. Today, we got so much liquid phase, which makes it easier to burn. So, the next 
day, the operator is also looking at the liquid phase, you know, and little by little, they are 
getting all this knowledge, all this knowledge, you know, and sometimes the problem is that, 
you know, how you approach to people. Sometimes people like a feeling like you are going 
to punish them, judge them. They feel fear and that's not the idea, you know, the people to be 
afraid of you. And I tell people, I'm just here to help, you know? My only job here is to make 
you look good, no worries. You know, I just, we just learn [from] each other. You teach me 
how you guys have been doing it and maybe I can help you to do a better, you know? And I 
feel happy, I think people is happy and people, as I mentioned to you people, most of the 
people I think everybody is very intelligent, you know, all humans, we are smart.   
 
VP: 
You describe like how do you start your day and just kind of what does a typical day 
look like for you at work?   
 
[00:38:56] 
 
HO: 
So, we got here, uh, so I just come to work every day, 6:30 in the morning and I start 
reviewing, um, the last 24-48 hours operation. So, in my computer I have access to all the 
trends, all the variables, all the temperatures, uh, pressures, all the emissions, everything. So, 
I start checking if we have any issue and I just analyze all the information, all the data we 
have. Then we had a process meeting and I explain to other people in the meeting, um, why 
things happen, what we felt, why that happened and what we should have done so it doesn’t 
happen again. So, we are working on corrective actions, you know, and, uh, and I just go and 
talk to the operators. Look, this is what we did, this is what we cannot do it this way. And this 
is how we are supposed to do. And we go from there. 
  
VP: 
And when do you typically finish work?  
 
9 
 
HO: 
I finish work, it’s really hard, it's really hard to finish work when you have so much 
work. It's really, really hard. I guess when my wife start getting upset with me, I think it's 
time to go home. But yeah, we had so much work here to get done, it’s just … We got room 
for so much improvement in is in every single area, you know, every single process. So, we 
had a lot of process here, it’s a big facility and even if I want to walk around all the plant, I 
can't you know, it will take forever. You know, I can spend just one day working in the heater 
tower, you know, if you are looking with details.  
 
VP: 
So, how many hours do you think you work for a week typically?  
 
HO: 
Uh, well, it depends. Maybe I think something between 50 and 60. And we just got 
out of the one of the longest outage of my life. So, they are, I say like that because we had a 
lot of difficulties to start back. But the outage, we had also a lot of work, you know, and 
usually the cement plants they planning, they always plan an outage for the beginning, for the 
winter time because the sales have slowed down. You know, most of the fields, the concrete 
jobs have slowed down during the winter because the conditions. So, cement business take 
advantage of that, do an outage that lasts around a month. And so we take advantage of that 
to do the major repairs that cannot be done during normal operation. Uh, and sometimes we 
had to spend a lot of weekends here. Sometimes we work a lot. And that's what we are trying 
to, that's where we are trying to work now, you know, to work too much, you know, but 
sometimes it's hard. You know, I get, um, very passionate and I’m a passionate person, very 
passionate for what I do. So, sometimes I go home and [unclear], you know, or studying how 
to improve things or sometimes you had an issue and you just can’t stop thinking about it. 
You just keep going and going and going until you can find the answer.  
 
VP: 
What would you say is the hardest part of your job?  
 
[00:43:27] 
 
HO: 
Keep the kiln running. No, sometimes it’s like, yeah, so it's like I … So, I do a lot of 
motivation to people. You know, people like to know what's going on. People like to know 
the importance of their jobs. So, and I told people, you know, when everything is running 
well, it's just easier for everybody, you know? The customers are happy, the quality is happy, 
you know, we are producing and everything is running. And the things are easier for 
everybody. But when the kiln goes down, it's just everybody has more work or when things 
are not running, [unclear] is broken apart, everybody has to go out and fix it and all of that. 
And unfortunately, there are so many, like, for example, this year, you know, it's already five 
months, by the end of five months. And we have had so many failures this year that hasn't 
been because production or operational mistakes that sometimes happen, you know, 
sometimes the operators plug the tower, fill it up the material, overburn and destroy the 
refractory in the kiln or many other things can happen from the operation. But luckily, this 
year, we haven't stopped because the process by we just had a little bit of local issues with the 
mechanical, you know, we had rock conveyers, you know, uh, sometimes the [unclear] fails, 
you know, got banned. Um, like right now the bearings get damaged, we need to replace 
those bearings. So, we need to take the kiln down, cool it off, it takes, you know, some time, 
so … There's just so many sensors, you know, transmitters, so much instrumentation and 
servers, pulses is a big deal, is so much things that we are depending on. We all wish, we 
decide to run the kiln as much as possible, but we are depending on so many things that 
anything can false any time. You know, we got so many [unclear], so many transmitters, 
thermocouples balls, you know, flow transmitters, flow meters. Uh, it's just so many 
10 
 
conditions. The raw materials come from the earth, you know, they are changing all the time, 
new challenges. So, every day we try the best to control our mix parameters, you know, but, 
uh, I think it's … cement manufacturing is a beautiful process and a very challenging one, 
you know? And I love it.  
 
VP: 
Yeah, but the what's the best part about your job or what keeps you motivated to keep 
working so hard?  
 
[00:46:57] 
 
HO: 
Uh, that's a good question. Uh, I think I kind of told you this before, but I just, I don't 
know, I feel very particular during my life, you know. I just, I try my best because I don't see 
myself here too long, you know. I never see myself to like in any company, but, I always love 
to like, you know, I always like to live like a [unclear]. So, in the refinery are systems where 
people still remember my name, because they say, oh, Harvy, the, you know, so in Redding, 
I'm pretty sure the people can say, oh, Harvy, did that, he showed us how to use that, he 
improved that, we were not doing that before. So, I think that's the most satisfying thing for 
me, you know, like when people say thank you, I didn't know that I learned so much with you 
in those few months that all the time that I was before you came, you know? So, I just think 
of making people happy is the most satisfying thing or maybe making people more 
comfortable. Like, I know the operators feel more comfortable, they wanted to live before 
because imagine you having the pressure to run something well, something that you don't 
understand how it runs. You don’t how that thing runs and you have all the pressure to run it 
well and you really understand what you are controlling. So, it was easier for me because 
they already know how to control everything, they just don't know what's happening. So, 
once I explain to them what is happening, what is the reason or those numbers that they are 
looking, they are like, oh, OK. So, now it's easier for them, you know, they just all start 
running better because now everything makes sense, you know? I always tell people, ask 
questions as the why of everything, you know, if you don't know something, just ask why. 
And I just think is the reason of this life, you know, you always need to know why things 
happen. And it's the way I like to work, you know? If something that makes sense to me, I’ll 
just stop and keep figuring out until it makes sense. You know, something is everything 
needs to make sense. Everything needs to be logical, you know, and there is a reason for 
everything and it’s just the way it should be, you know?  
 
VP: 
So, in closing out this interview, is there something that you feel like you haven't had 
a chance to talk about or is there a question that I didn't ask that you would like to address?  
 
HO: 
I think we covered a lot. I think we could spend so many days, you know, I could 
share so many experiences that we could speak a lot, a lot more. I would give you my contact 
if you need, if you would like another interview or something else. Because there is a lot to 
talk [about], yeah, I think we just got a few minutes and I also got to go. Um, but there is so 
much to talk about and there's so much to improve and they are so much to learn. Um, in all 
the fields, you know, all the fields. Uh, and yeah, no, I think the most important and we 
covered the most important, I don't know if you have anything else, any other questions.  
 
VP: 
I think this was wonderful. Thank you so much for your time.
