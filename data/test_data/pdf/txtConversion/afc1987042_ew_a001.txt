TAPE BEGINS WITH INTERVIEWER IN MID-SENTENCE:  Lowell Folklife Project, October
15, 1987.  Film worker, Eleanor Wacks.  Interview with William Dristiliaris.
E:  October 15th.  [W:  October 15th, 1987.]  Okay.  Why don't you tell me a little bit about the 
Candle Shop.  You said that it was a family run business.
W:  Well, our we on?  [E:  Yeah, we're on.]  Okay, fine and dandy.  Well, basically, uh, we go 
back to the turn of the century around 1910, that era.  And, uh, our dad, who had recently arrived 
a few years previous to that.  [E:  Arrived from where?]  From Greece.  [E:  Where in Greece?  
Where is the city?]  Oh, in the north, uh, north, in the northern part of Greece, uh, the county of 
Latesa(?)  and the village of Kustanya(?).  And, uh, anyway, he was working oh, here and there, 
the Mills, and doing a lot of odd jobs.  And one of the odd jobs, he was helping this other Greek 
man in his small candle factory.  Everything was hand-made and the man had a few accounts.  A 
few church accounts, there wasn't that many Greek Churches in the country at the time.  Anyway
he had a few church accounts and, uh, and the unusual thing about this man, his name was uh, 
Anasoulas(?).  I don't recall his first name.  [E:  How do you spell that?]  I wouldn't even attempt 
it.  Anasoulas, something like that.  And, uh, my dad worked with the man when the man would 
have an order, dad and the man would work together.  And the man would, uh, had difficulty 
simulating to this culture, and wish to go back to Greece, and he did that, so before leaving he 
sold, uh, his business to my father.  This was 100 odd dollars or so.  [E:  A hmm.]  I think it was 
less than $200, I'm not quite sure of the amount.  And that was around 1910 there abouts.  And as
the, uh, Greek population increased, and they started scattering all over the country, uh, Greeks 
are unique in a sense.  One of the first projects they will take on, if there is enough of them in the
neighborhood, in the city too, is to start a church.  And, uh, as more churches were established, 
dad was one of the early ones in this line of work, business picked up to the extent where today 
we ship all the way down the east coast into Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, and as far west as 
California.  So, and most of that is from word of mouth and, uh, people knowing us on a personal
basis.  Uh, so that is one way the business has expanded as more churches came established, 
business grew, and other people went into the same business, so now you have the all-American 
tradition of competition.  Which I think is healthy if it is honest competition.
E:  So when did you start making candles?  Were you around the shop when you were a little 
boy?
W:  Oh yeah, I have been in the shop since I was, uh, in grammar school.  I would swing by and 
do all little odd jobs here and there, trim candles, quick wicks, uh, even do some dipping on 
occasion.  Uh, so I have been doing it over 50 years now.  Uh, (--)
E:  At what time did you take over the business from your father?
W:  Well I didn't take it over myself exclusively.  I had two other brothers.  And when my dad 
past away, we had, uh, the decision to make, whether to liquidate the company or keep it going.  
And mother, uh, didn't want to liquidate.  So the three of us, the three brothers, kept it going.  
And uh, (--)  [E:  What year was that?]  Oh that was 30 odd years ago.  [E:  A huh.]  My dad past 
away.  He has been dead for 35 years at least.  [E:  A hmm.]  So the three of us worked it.  And 
uh, on a part time basis I might add, because uh, again the economics of the business was such 
that it would support one let alone three.  Because again there was a lot of hand work involved.  
And, uh, giving it some thought, uh, the only way we could survive or make a decent living out 
of it, was to mechanize, bring in modern equipment and so forth.  And we started doing that.  We 
brought in (--)  [E:  This was 30 years ago?]  Yeah, 35 years ago.  One of the first things we 
brought in was uh, a dipping frames.  [E:  A hmm.]  Uh, before the (--)  We designed a wicking 
frames.  All the wicks were put by hand and there was a slow tedious job.  
E:  You would still be able to do that today if you wanted to wouldn't you?
W:  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  And, uh, so by putting in the frames you eliminated right of from the 
beginning two hand operations.  [E:  What were the hand operations, from beginning to end?]  
Well the hand operations from the beginning, I might even go down and find one, was simply a 
narrow board, with nails sticking out into it.  And uh, you would have a long piece of wick lets 
say for the lengths of the candles you wanted to make.  And you would tie a half knot on it and 
then stick this into the nails.  Well you know when your nails are only an inch apart, so you 
always get nails pricks in your fingers.  Anyone would say it was a slow tedious job.  So by 
designing these dipping frames, I eliminated the, uh, job of rolling up the wick, cutting it, 
knotting it, bundling it.  So now the girls that put the wick, they just tie one knot on start and they
work right off the spool of wick.  It's just up and down and uh (--)  [E:  What's the wick made out
of, Cotton?]  Cotton.  Yeah, cotton, and bleach, it's bleached at the factory.  We are one of the few
candle companies that still use uh, a certain number of wick.  It's all cotton but it's bleached at 
the factory especially for us.  [E:  Where do you get it from?]  Uh, one of the Mills in the 
Carolina's.  
E:  Why is it have to be bleached?
W:  Because if it is unbleached, when a candle is burning, it will give you off excessive smoke.  
Black smoke.  And then when you snuff it out, it will still give you that black smoke.  So, by 
bleaching it you eliminate ever cleaning the burning candle, no smoke, smokeless, whatever.  
And uh, so, consequently, by going from the hand-dipped to the frame on the board, from the 
board where you had to tie a knot and slip it on and all that.  And going to these other frames that
I designed, uh, uh, two man operation.  Well the old system would give you maybe 50 pounds 
production a day.  Good morning.  I thought you retired.  I thought you quit.  [O:  This is my last 
trip.]  Oh, all right.  That's one of my wax suppliers.  And he comes in about every few days a 
week.  Right now I am totally out of the wax that he supplies me.  [E:  Oh.]  So, he's bringing me
another ton of wax today.  Uh, so in the old system two people could make maybe 50 pounds of 
candles a day on these very thin, there eastern style devotional lights.  They're about the size of a 
pencil.  And now with this new system, uh, immediately two people on an eight hour day, instead
of just coming out with 50 pounds, your coming out with 300.  [E:  Uh hmm.]  The work was, 
uh, less technical because with the old wicks, the old dipping frames, the wicks would be free 
hanging.  Another words they would just be flopping there.  And, uh, the operator would put this 
wick in the dipping tank, the board, and let it soak for a minute or two.  Then pull it out, and they
were all tangled up like when you come out of the shower and your hair, you haven't used a 
rinse.  And then he would literally comb them out.  And that was very time consuming.  Where 
these new wicks, now, you dip them in, let them soak, pull them up and put them away.  It is a 
ridged frame over a loose frame.  
E:  So you design these frames?
W:  Yeah, uh huh.
E:  Speed to be more efficient?
W:  Yes, yes, and also you can train a person with average native intelligence, one or days 
training, okay your on your own.  
E:  How many people do you pull in?
W:  Uh, ten.  Total, there is ten of us here.  And the hand-dipping and down here.   And that's an 
essence on hand dipping.  In hand dipping you dip the frame, take it out of the container of wax 
there, set it aside and dip another one.  So in the process where the operator will have say 50 
frames on one rack, by the time he or she has finished dipping the last one, the first one has dried
enough to take another dip.  And the process just keeps repeating itself, until you acquire the 
diameter that you are looking for.  And then you just get another rack and do it over again.  So, 
(--)
E:  How many candles do you produce in a day?
W:  Oh, thousands and thousands.  We are not that sophisticated where we have, uh, you know, 
records of (--) production records, because this is the kind of industry where you don't have to 
maintain code numbers for uh, recalling items.  We never had to recall a candle, like lets say a 
[E:  A car.]  A car, or a food in a can.  So there is no recall.  We don't have a (--)
E:  So there are some parts of the process that are still hand-on and some parts of the process 
were hand-on and now are mechanon.  
W:  They're mechanized to an extent.   They're not totally mechanized.  These molding machines 
here, uh, those candles at one time were hand dipped.  [E:  A huh.]  But in order to be 
competitive we had to go into molding.  And it gives you as good a candle if not better than a 
hand-dipped candle.  
E:  Who do you supply your candles to?  Is it primarily churches?
W:  Primarily, we're still primarily churches.  [E:  Churches in the Lowell area?]  Oh, yes.  [E:  
Any (--)]  My own parish of course.  [E:  UNCLEAR]  Transfiguration, and the Assumption, on 
occasion Holy Trinity, or another St. George.  But as I said over the years people saw it as a good
source of income, and they went into the business.  Uh, where we were practically the only 
candle suppliers in the early part of the century, now there is a couple of dozen of them.  And, uh,
the competition is there.  [E:  What makes for a good candle, how do you know, what are some 
of the things that are in your (--)]  Yeah, okay.  The main criteria is how is it going to be used.  
Okay.  Now if it is going to be used at a home, lets say on a dining table, uh, naturally you don't 
want that candle to be so smoke, making so much smoke that it is going to blacken the ceilings.  
Most homes have what an 8 foot ceiling.  
E:  Do you, uh, (--) Are the candles that you sell also end up in homes as well?
W:  Oh, yes, we (--) [E:  Sell them at the shop.]  We sell them here at the shop.  We sell dinner 
[UNCLEAR]  And we sell religious candles here at the shop.  [E:  I noticed that.]  Well the main 
reason we sell religious candles here is the faithful Roman Catholic friends, they can buy them at
the church, but they are going to have to pay much, much more for them.  Without mentioning 
one church they have a nice little retail outlet in there gift store, religious good store, and you can
buy a dozen of vidual candles there for the last I heard was $45 a dozen.  You can pick them up 
here for $15.  So, there is a difference.  And uh, a lot of our Catholic customers say, well those 
are blessed, I will bless these myself.  Save thirty dollars.  But the intent was there's.
E:  Let's go back a minute about what makes for a good candle?  I sort of got you off tract.
W:  Okay, candles today are basically made out of Refined Carafin(?), sterine, and bees wax.  
Those are the three main ingredients that go into a good candle making formula.  You can deviate
it, uh, but candles coming out of the far east, Hong Kong, Sipan, Tiawan, and India, those areas, 
those candles are 100% Arafin, which makes for a decent candle that is cheap.  But they are fast 
burning.  A 12 inch candle of 100% Arafin with the average size diameter might burn two, three 
hours.  Where the candles we produce here 12 inch would burn eight, nine, ten hours.  They are 
more expensive but in the long run you get a better candle.  So the thing that makes the candle is 
the combination of the formula and the wick.  You have to (--)  You can not use the same size 
wick for all diameter candles.  Uh, (--)
E:  So does each company then have there own formula?
W:  Oh, yeah, most of them have there own formula.  Uh, then when they get the church candles,
uh, you can go as high as 100% bees wax.  Again, a good staring candle would burn as good if 
not better than 100% bees wax candle.  But, uh, the churches traditionally want bees wax on the 
altar.  [E:  Why?]  It's just tradition.  Because that was the prime source of wax at one time.  And 
then they went into oil, then, uh, oil out of the earth was discovered what 125-30 years and then 
in the process of refining it (--)  God there is thousands of products that are made from Crude 
Oil, and one of them is Parifin(?) and uh, (--)
E:  How is the formula decided on?  Is it something that you put together?  Is it a formula that 
your father had put together that you still use or (--)
W:  Well my father had a fantastic formula but then things were different in the days of Canaba 
Wax.  [E:  Canaba?] Canaba, that comes from a tree in South America.  It's very, very hard wax.  
It's harder than granite in my estimation.  And it gives you a very good  shine.  It gives a nice 
gloss.  But it is very expensive.  You can, you can, uh, get the same gloss from a hand-dipped 
candle by after finishing the last dip then dip it into a bed of cold water.  You get the same 
saturney finish.  And you don't have the expense of the Canaba Wax.  Bees wax is very 
expensive.  So as the years go on and the economics dictates how your going to (--) your 
formula.  Formula's are constantly changing.  Uh, (--)  [E:  So, you will sort of play with the 
formula and experiment?]  Oh yes.  [E:  Almost like a chemist in a way.]  Right, in a way you 
have to (--)  [E:  A formula's sort of family secrets?]  No not really.  Public libraries are loaded 
with How to books on candle making, and uh, I consulted the library oh, many, many year ago 
when I was a young man, and my dad and I would get into heat of discussion over frozen corn, 
[UNCLEAR]  [E:  Did you listen to your dad?]  Very seldom.  [LAUGHING]  Uh, he and I we 
got along but we argued a lot over technical things.  Uh, I was always the quizzed at mind.  And 
I'd say "You know dad, if we do it this way"  "Hey boy"  he would say to me, "Just keep doing it 
the way your doing it, don't mess with success."  And there is a lot of truth to that.  Don't mess 
with success.  Even today, I would say, what if I did it this way instead of that way.  I am always 
looking for better avenue's to do things.  It is less boring that way too.  If you do the same thing 
day in and day out.  [E:  Yeah, of course.]  Yeah.  
E:  You have been doing this for a long, long time.  
W:  Yeah, yeah.  [E:  People want change.]  Yeah.  [E:  But it is interesting too how some 
traditional ways keep persisting and stay with the old way if you don't want to pamper with 
success.]  Why dad?  Because.  I could never accept that answer "because".  To me it wasn't (--)
E:  So what are some things you have experimented with?
W:  Well, I experimented with, first of all it was my hand dipping method.  [E:  Right, you 
mentioned that already.]  Yeah.  And then I experimented with molding.  [E:  A huh.]  I had a lot 
of failure in that before common sense said to me, "Now wait a minute, you did it this way 
instead of that way you will have better results".  Again trail and era in experience.  So I got it 
down to a point to where molding I can do it blind folded and get a very superior candle.  My 
mother use to make, she use to poor, (--) She would stand on a platform similar to that and (--) 
[E:  Okay, wood table.]  And suspended from the ceiling with a ring, and on that ring, you know 
the huge ring, there may have been 24 wicks hanging and the wicks would be anywhere from 4-6
feet in length.  In the Greek churches, in the Orthodox churches they burn these huge candles.  
And she would stand on that platform and get a bottle of wax and pour it over the top of the wick
and at the same time twist the wick, and she would make the most beautiful huge candles.  I 
mean they were uniform and (--)  But it would take her a week to finish the ring because when 
you build it up so much then you would have to leave it over night so it could cure before you 
could build on it again.  Then I started thinking what if (--) Again the "what if".  Actually, I had a
lot of compassion for my mother, I didn't want to see her working that hard, you know.  My 
father, by the way, you to call me the black protestant.  I was always protesting I guess.  Looking 
for ways.  My mother would say to him  "You will never understand him, George."  So, the 
motivating factor to make the molded candles was to give my mother a break, so she wouldn't 
have to work that hard, so.  Again, experiment in whatever.  And I got that down path, where I 
could make uh, 4, 5, 6 foot candles or dozens of them in one day instead of a week.
E:  So some of the things that make for a good candle then are the evenness, the gloss on the 
outside (--)
W:  The ultimate thing is how is it burning.  Okay.  You don't want it to smoke, you don't want it 
to drip excessively.  Of course, there is a lot of things that will cause a candle to drip.  A draft, air
conditioning, high ceilings you know the cathedral type ceilings, these create drafts, and a good 
candle in a uh,  I don't know if there is such a thing as the perfect environment, will burn and 
give you a nice steady glow, no smoke, and burn evenly, and not drip all over you Irish linen on 
your table cloth, that thing.  
E:  Can we talk, uh, a little bit about the process.  Maybe what you would like to do is walk 
through the different areas in your shop so we can talk about the process from the beginning and 
the end.  You might want to start with what materials are needed.
W:  Well, basically the materials that, uh, (--)  Now these are double jacketed stainless steel 
kettles, and they are heated by steam, we have a boiler down cellar and that produces the steam.  
Before, we had that kettle similar to that with [E:  Smaller kettle?] yeah, with direct gas.  And 
although that was adequate for the times, the draw back to that was it was dangerous for one 
thing because if you neglected the kettle the temperatures could build up and reach the 
spontaneous combustion stage.  Where the the double jacketed kettles you can't, it is impossible. 
It is impossible to reach the combustion stage.  Also, uh, they were uh, (--) The floor is messy but
you are not going to slip.  [E:  Yeah, no, Yeah I noticed it was a little wet.]  Another thing with 
those kettles was when you came to work in the morning, you had to light the jets because over 
night the wax inside becomes solid and then your looking around for things to do while the wax 
became liquid.  So sometimes it would be an hour or two before you had an opportunity to make 
candles. 
E:  At what temperature does that happen?
W:  Spontaneous combustion?  Way over 300.  [E:  Okay.]  Where with the stainless steel kettles 
you eliminate the hazard of spontaneous combustion, and by having a timer on the clock, when 
you come in in the morning, the liquid is waiting for you.  
E:  Had there been accidents before with the other method?
W:  No, we've had one fire, uh, two fires in 70 odd years we have been in business.  One was 
caused by vandalism, and the other one was caused by the freak of nature.  [E:  What happened?]
A down draft.  We had a small boiler upstairs, and the down draft came down and blew the pilot 
light and there was some piece of paper there and that caught fire and spread.  [E:  Hmm.  How 
long ago was that?]  That was oh, maybe 5-10 years ago.  [E:  Was that in this building?]  Yup.  
[E:  How long did you say you were in this building?]  Twenty five years.  [E:  Twenty five 
years?  A hmm.]  Yeah, twenty five years.  [E:  It's like meat loaf pans.]  Yeah, that is exactly 
what they are.  And this is the left over wax that was in that kettle.  [E:  A huh.]  Uh, and we 
blocked it up.  
E:  So get back into the beginning.  What else goes into the big kettle?
W:  Well if you look into the kettle here.  You can stand up here.  See all those old wicks.  [E:  
Oh yeah, it looks like spaghetti.]  Yeah.  Uh, one of the amazing things about candles, if you use 
old waxes, used waxes, your going to make a better candle than if you use all new waxes.  [E:  
Why?  Do you know why?]  I don't know what it is, but it's there.  My molder, when I don't have 
old wax, there is old candles to blend into the new, he will complain like holy heck and making 
new candles from all new waxes just isn't (--)
E:  So that's why he was pouring some of those candles into the kettle.
W:  Yeah, this is the thing.  This is all used candles that I pulled out of a church yesterday.  Now, 
see these were originally 15 inches.  In the (--)  [E:  So you go back to the places that you supply 
them and take the (--)  That's why they always look fresh in a church.]  Cause they are.  [E:  
Yeah.]  In the Eastern Orthodox Church the candle is lit one time.  When the Litergy is over the 
candles are put out and set aside.  When I go to deliver my next order I'll bring them all there 
fresh candles, pick up all the remains, and use it to blend in with new wax, this is my formula.  
[E:  Ecological sound business.  When you (--)]  This is the wax that we presently use.  It comes 
from Oklahoma.  [E: A hmm.  You can feel it.]  It's a very hard wax.  It is 100% refined parifin.  
[E:  Is this Parifin?  Yeah.]  Yeah, that is 100% Parifin.  [E:  So this is the same stuff they put on 
top of jelly, you know when you making fruit.]  Yeah.  [O:  Yeah, you buy the little one at 
Demoulas or supermarkets]  
E:  So, how big is this lets say?]
W:  Its about an 11 pound slab.  And there is about 200 of these in one pallet.  We buy these by 
the pallets.  And that's part of the ingredients that would go into the [E:  The kettles?] the tapers.  
Now this wax here is different.  [O:  It looks the same.]  It looks the same but it isn't.  
[OPENING WAX]  [E:  Oh yeah.  How is this different?]  Well it has a higher oil content.  [E:  
Yeah.  A hmm.]  And it isn't as refined as that one.  Now, using this wax here you don't need 
anything else for the purpose of this wax.  The purpose of this wax is to make vidual lights in 
glass.  That wax is too good for that purpose.  You'd just be (--)  It would just be like grinding up 
Filet Minoin(?) for Hamburg.  Same thing.  [E:  A hmm.  I understand.]  Uh, these here are one 
of my (--) Again when my mother was making them hand, I had to figure out a way to do them 
the other way.  I just taken an aluminum tuben, simple stainless tuben and having a head sort of 
made at a machine shop and by putting them together, it may take me a moment to do that, make 
a mold.  [DROPPING SOMETHING]  Kathy, you want to get a number four?  You create a 
needle.  [E:  Oh, that is like a needle threader.]  Yeah, but this is (--)  One day I was trying to 
figure out where I could get needles long enough to wick my candles.  [E:  A hmm.]  And my 
mother, who did not have any formal education at all, [E:  A hmm.]  [E:  Could you hold your 
hand still for one second?]  Sure.  [E:  Thanks.]  [TAKING PICTURE]  She was loaded with 
common sense that woman.  She says to me "Billy, take a piece of wire, fold in half, and then 
what do you have?"  And I said "Oh no.  So simple."  you know.  Okay, now this is just ordinary 
weather seal putty.  And I am going to use that to cover up the hole so that the wax will not drip 
out.  [E:  Okay.]  Common Cottor Pin, and that wick now, that is all set.  [UNCLEAR]  [E:  
Okay, so you got the frame.]  All the setting up you have to do is fill this up with wax.  [E:  A 
huh.  And then you have it.]  And then you have it.  And uh, you can, uh, go back a few hours 
later and take it out.  All set, instead of taking a weeks to make it.  So the (--)   This is a candle.  
[E:  Wow, that's some candle.]  Yeah.  What are these candles used for, churches?  They're used 
in churches, they do more than people making special requests, forfilling promises, things of that
nature.  You notice how [UNCLEAR] white it is?  [E:  Uh huh.]  That has about 35-40% sterine 
in it.  And Parifin.  If you compair the difference and amount each one has.  [E:  There is a lot 
more Parifin in there.  It is whiter.  The candle is whiter, and clearer, and smoother.]  And it is 
Opage.  The purpose of it is it gives you a finer finish, and it slows down the buring of the 
candle, and it gives you more long lasting life.  It makes it stronger, it has uh, (--) you dont want 
to burn the place down.  [E:  No.]  No.  Basically, that system holds true for even the molding.  
[E:  A huh.]  See Those are water cooled and this is air cooled.  That's air cooled.  
E:  Now, let me see if I have the process right.  You start off over there.
W:  First you have to melt your wax down, naturally.
E:  The formula if made in the kettle.  So it is a question of which wax you use, and other things 
you add as well, bees wax.
W:  Sterine.  So you just uh, (--)  [E:  And then after they are out of the kettle, after the wax is 
prepared, the next step is (--)]  To use it.  So you can either use it in the machine, or pour it here 
in the candle mold.  [E:  Okay.  What is the stuff in the back.  That was the cleaning the glass, 
right.]  This here was the cleaning up the bottles.  That is paint.  [E:  A huh.  That's why your 
hands are so red, right?]  Yeah, well I was painting this morning.  [E:  So your sterilizing the 
bottles.  So you got the bottles back again from the churches?]  Yeah. A huh.  No you see that.  
This is the special paint.  [E:  It comes right off.]  Yeah.  It comes off relativally easy.  And uh, 
and that paint is water proof.  It's not a oil based paint.  It doesn't have any (--) Agian this is 
non-combustable material.  And this paint is made only in one source in the country.  [E:  What is
the name for it?  Is there any particular name for the type of paint?]  It's just transparent.  [E:  
Where do you get it from?]  Now that is a trade secret.  [E:  Okay.]  Okay.  Like I say uh, (--)  [E:
Every occupation has it's trade secrets.]  That's right but there's hundreds of paint factory's in the 
country, and if somebody wanted to find out, it would just take a question of getting information 
(--)
E:  How long does this process take of cleaning the bottles?  You get the bottles back, you pick 
them up from the churches.
W:  Well, assuming after your water, there also chemicals in there that help chew it up a little bit.
And, uh, it would take, oh, I would say, I never really timed it that closely but, once the water is 
hot, it has four racks, by time the first rack is ready to do (--)  [E:  You could fit 20 on the rack or 
so?]  Yeah.  Like when he finishes this rack, uh, (--)  [E:  Great, yeah, I see it.]  By the time he 
finishes this one, [E:  I would take a photo but I ran out of film.  I need to change.] he will load it
up again and then he will advance the other racks.  It's just an endless process.  [E:  Process.]  
And uh, I don't time it because again (--)  [E:  Would you say it takes an hour or less?]  Oh, much
less than that, much less than that.  [E:  Okay.]  Right now I am just putting this soap through.  
[E:  Can we go over to the machine over there?  Check that one out.]  
E:  Okay, I need to reload my film.  Why don't we explain this and then I will rechange my film.  
You have four machines?
W:  Oh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 down here.  [E:  I must have missed one.]  There is one over there that you
walked right by.  Okay.  These machines are basically simple.  
E:  They almost look like the kind of machines that you find in a cotton mill.
W:  I've never been in a cotton mill working.  But anyway this is (--) The mold, uh, secured in a, 
we'll call it a jacket, and in this particular case there's, uh, 24, there is 30 dozen molds in here.  
So that makes what, 360 molds in this machine here.  Each mold has it's own piston.  [E:  Uh 
huh.]  Now the piston has a dual purpose.  When the piston's are in postion, they act as the 
stopper for the bottom of the mold.  Because without that then the wax would come all the way 
through.  The piston is also hallow and as you can see each piston has it's own source of wick 
supply.  [E:  Uh hmm.]  And it's also self feeding so that when these candles now are finished and
they are going to be jacked up.  [E:  Uh huh.]  You'll notice that the wick is going to come up 
with it.  [E:  Yeah, I see that.  Uh hmm.]  So the only time the operator has to wick a mold is 
when the spool runs out and that could be thousands of pourings down the road.  Uh, the good 
part about it is we use different size spools, because we don't want all 360 to run out at the same 
time.  And that would take him a week to rewick all of them.  [E:  Right.]  So by having various 
sizes, uh, two, three, maybe five will run out per day and he just [E:  Exactly.]  does it that way.  
Now we are looking at 360 dozen candles [E:  So this process (--)] in about an hours time.  [E:  
Okay.]  And if you compare this to hand dipped, now you are talking 8 hours, hand-dipped.  [E:  
So this puts the wick (--)]  With a total operation.  
E:  So this is called (--)  What did you say it was called, wicking?  [W:  Molding.]  Molding.
W:  Yeah, these are molded candles.  Uh, (--)  [E:  So they are strung up?]  Yeah, their all, now.  
[E:  So the candles, (--) Okay.]  He's ready to string one here.  [E:  I see it loose, yeah.  So there 
(--)]  There is another one on the other side.  These candles now are finished.  [E:  Right.  I saw 
him pulling the candles off the rack.]  Yeah, now before he can take these candles out [E:  Yeah.] 
he has to make another batch.  [E:  So the melted wax then is transfered into the (--)  Okay where
is it put into (--)  Oh, okay.]  If you want to stand up there that would be okay.  [E:  Okay, I will 
go on my toes.]  You see, these are the molds.  [E:  I see.]  And the 360 of them, each mold has 
it's own piston.  Now, when he makes more candles from there, what he is going to do is lock 
them.  Lock this receiving rack.  [E:  Uh hmm.]  That will keep (--)  If I don't lock them, see 
what happens.  The candles come back down.  [E:  Yeah.]  Okay.  [E:  Uh huh.]  But by locking it
[E:  Uh huh.] that will hold the candles up there while the pistons go down.  And as the pistons 
go down they line up the wick again for the next process.  [E:  Uh hmm.]  So (--)  [E:  So it 
forces the wick in.]  No it forces the wick (--)  Lines the wick (--)  The wick is already in the 
mold.  [E:  Right.  It forces it when you pull it up (--)]  Yeah, it brings the wick up for the next 
batch.  [E:  Yeah, that's what I meant to say.]  And if you will observe (--) Uh, [UNCLEAR], you 
got wicks to make?  You got to do wicks?  There's two down there.  Now?  Okay.  I can lower it 
down just a little bit.  [E:  Okay.  So it is strong, the wax goes into the center.]  Yeah, that's right.  
[E:  What a great photograph.]  See the way the candles stay up and the wicks come down.  This 
piston is going to come all the way down here.  And this part here will now be down here.  These
will be all the way down here.  [E:  Uh hmm.]  And when they reach down there the wicks will 
automatically go into place.  And he will pour his wax through these gutters lets call them.  And 
[E:  That's it.] basically that is it.  [E:  So it is a process of setting this up?]  Setting it up.  Okay, 
now, technically just locked these here.  It took me a second to lock it up.  I've got 360 candles 
all wicked.  If I was to do that with my hand I'm talking about a half an hour.  [E:  Exactly.]  So I 
just did that in a few seconds.  [E:  Right.]  And that is one advantage over the candles by 
molding them.  Because when they come off the machine they are finished and ready to be 
packed.  [E:  Be what?  Packed?]  Yeah.  [E:  Yeah, just pack them.  Uh hmm.]  So as against the 
hand-dipped candle, they have to be cut off the frames, trimmed, and then packed.  Again, (--) 
[E:  Much faster.]  Yeah.  Uh, like if he was to work on this for later, things are a little slow right 
now, but when he is on this for the full 8 hour day, [E:  Uh hmm.] he can produce more candles 
in one day than a, uh, single operator could produce in a week.  
E:  What is your busy time?
W:  Well, right after August the 15th, which is The Assumption of the Virgin Mary, right up to 
Easter.  Uh, if I was to create a sales chart, it would just be a simple B.  [E:  Uh huh, uh huh.]  
Because we have our low peak, the B or the X mark would start going down right after Easter, 
and would go down May, June, July, August, and then in August it would start going all the way 
up.  And, uh, in a couple of months the phone will be ringing off the hook.  [E:  Yeah.  Well it is 
certainly is an important service for the community.  For the Religious Community.]  Yeah, a 
number of my customers already have started putting in there Easter inventory for "88".  They 
can't wait for the last minute because I say "Hey, your ordering ten pounds of Blueberries and I 
only have a 5 pound bag."  So they order well in advance, and, uh, I'll stock them up.  [E:  Uh 
hmm.]  Uh, one church alone can go through, uh, a hundred cases of this in one weeks time.  [E: 
Hmm, that is quite a bit.]  Yeah, that is quite a bit.  Uh, tomorrow I'll be, uh, driving up to 
Albany, New York with 25 cases.  [E:  Uh huh.  So you're your own delivery person as well?]  
Oh yeah, I'm a delivery person.  [E:  You get out on the road?]  Yeah, I get out on the road, and I 
quit scraping floors though, I got the other guys for that.  I use to do that too at one time.  So 
basically (--)  [E:  Did you have to do that when you were a kid?]  Yeah.  Yeah.  [E:  Scrape the 
floors.  Scrape the wax off the floor.]  Yeah.  [E:  There must have been some funny stories 
associated with that.]  Oh god.
SIDE ONE ENDED
TAPE BEGINS WITH INFORMANT:  Basically, [UNCLEAR]  need water cooled and water 
heated molding machines.  And they are manually operated.  The newer models today, some are 
hydrodically operated and others are electrically operated.  That is to raise the candles out of the 
mold.  But this is still a basic machine.  I've had it, uh, 15 years.  Some machines [E:  Uh hmm.]  
Some machines here I have had as much as 30 years.  If you take care of something, it will take 
care of you.  And basically it's very, very simple.  After setting the machine up by lowering the 
piston and warming up the machine with warm water, then the operator can go ahead and fill it 
up with wax.  It shouldn't take him but maybe 5 minutes.  He's got full gutters here.
TAPE STOPS AND THEN BEGINS AGAIN BUT IS UNCLEAR
TAPE BEGINS AGAIN WITH INFORMANT IN MID-SENTENCE:  So he took the bigger of 
the two.  And, uh, I gave him a tape of my last (--)
INTERVIEWER IN MID-SENTENCE:  So you go back to Greece often? 
W:  I go back every year [E:  Every year?]  Or two.  Yeah.  I'm native born here, by the way.  [E: 
I was going to ask you that.  Okay, uh, let me just find this card.]  By the way, that is my 
daughter Kathy.  [E:  I was going to ask you if that was your daughter.  How many children do 
you have?]  Kathy's my first born.  [E:  Uh huh.]  I have five children.  Three girls and two boys. 
E:  The name of the store is that (--)
W:  Ymittos.  Y-m-i-t-t-o-s.  [E:  Y-m- (--)  How did that name come about?]  Oh, that's 
misspelled.  It's name of a mountain in Greece [E:  Uh huh.] where there are wild bees and it's, 
uh, what we would call comprable to a national park where people can go gather their own bees 
wax and honey.  [E:  Uh hmm.]  And that is misspelled, that another story in that.  [E:  What's the
story?]  Well, dad didn't know how to spell English.  [LAUGHING]  It's that simple.  [O:  And 
they change the spelling of your name, and you don't know how to spell it, you don't know 
English and they don't know how to spell your name.]  [E:  Was your dad's name spelled 
incorrectly?]  No.  It's uh (--)  [E:  How do you spell the name of the mountain?]  H-m-y-t-t-o-s.  
[E:  Okay. How about the phone number?]  Uh, area code 617-453-2824, if a woman answers 
hang up.
TAPE STOPS AND CONTINUES WITH INFORMANT IN MID-SENTENCE:  Queens, I had 
alot of [UNCLEAR]  But then, uh, three years ago, four years ago, uh, this fella asked me "Do 
you get a lot of churches here to buy candles here from you?"  And the tone of his voice and his 
non-verbals brought my defenses up and I said "I'm just a truck driver today."  [LAUGHING]  
O:  The reason I asked you about Lowell and Dracut is because there was a lady in Dracut who 
went to the Topsfield Fair and won blue ribbons for English Smocking.  [W:  What the heck is 
English Smocking?]  It's that little embroydery stuff that you see on little girls dresses.  [E:  It's 
like little v-shape stitches, it bunches up the fabric and it's very (--)  We are looking for people in 
the Lowell area, uh I know smocking is really the in thing (--)]
W:  These are the old wicks right.  [E:  Yeah.]   Do you see that?  [E:  Yeah.]  That's going to end 
up in my wood burning stove.  And that will burn for about two hours.  [E:  Uh huh.  What's 
downstairs?]  Down stairs is bottles and storage.  That kettle there [UNCLEAR].
[WALKING]  E:  Woops.
W:  A clear wax is the appropriate setting for clear wax would be carnations, that's a white 
flower, or vanilla.  So (--)  [E:  That's usually in church?]  No, we don't put (--)  So if I wanted to 
make a center candle I want to take some vinalla and put it in just at the last minute if you don't 
want it to desipate.
W:  How are you feeling John?  [J:  Uh, not bad.  Not bad for my age.]  How old are you, by the 
way?  [J:  Old enough to vote.]  [E:  Oh, 18, hey.]  Oh, about that.  [E:  Maybe you can get a car 
soon.]
E:  Okay, let me tape the remaining (--)
W:  The only thing that is left now is upstairs I think.
INTERVIEWER AND INFORMANT ARE IN ANOTHER ROOM
E:  Okay, so let me just pack this stuff up.
W:  I think I will have another coffee.  Would you like another one?  [E:  Oh, quick cup, and then
I am gonna (--)]  Quick cup.  [E:  Quick cup.]
