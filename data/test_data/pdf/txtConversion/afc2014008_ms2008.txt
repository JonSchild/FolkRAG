Five  years  1ater,  the  basic  formt;l atiori  still  sat isfi es  us,
 
still,  I think,  thrills  us  a little.
 It  is  ennobling  to  reali ze
 
that  the  government  of  the  Uni tnd  Stat
s  has  launched  a program  that,
 
however  small,  seeks  to  "help  enrich  the  lives  of  all  Americans  by
 
making more  visible  the  sophistication,  the  vivacity,  and  the  mean-
ingfulness  of  our  multi-cultural  heritage".
 There  it  is,  in  black
 
and  white  in  an  official  federal  document:  we  are  roing  hoynnd  the
 
melting  pot  (always  a slightly  unpleasant  netaphor)  into  the  '
r o  of
'
 
the  mosaic.
 The  encouragement  of  the  so-called  "small"  cultural  art
 
forms  is  agreed  upon  to  be,  in  some  degree,  of  national  importance.
 
The  establishment  by  Congress  of  the  American  Folklife  Center  at  tho
 
Library  of  Congress  and  the  development  of  the  Folklife  Prorran  st
 
n Snithsonjan  Institution  are  further  evidence  of  this  national
 
intent. 
This  intent  is,  after  all,  in  accordance  with  our  f
inest
 
national  traditions.
 The  promise  of  artistic  freedom  has  brought
.
 
many  individual  artists  of  world  significance  to  these  shores,  where
 
they  have  contributed  enormously  to  the  quality  of  our  national  life.
 
Cultural freedom  is  a less  often  discussed  extension  of  that  sane
 
promise.
 Throughout  our  history,  the  United  States  has  opened  its
,
 
doors  to groups  displaced  from  their nations  of origin,  groups
 
ranging  from  the  Pennsylvania Dutch  of  the  seventeenth  century  to
 
the  twentieth  century  Cambodians.
 And  each  group  has  brought  their
 
talents,  their  energies,  and  their  matured  art  forms  with  them  as
 
gifts  to  this  country.

 artistic  traditions  are  so
 
insignificant  after  all.
 I suspect  that  the  number  of  first-class
 
mariachi  ensembles  activeir  playing  in  the  United  States  m ight  compare
 
- 3 --
favorably  with  the  number  of  string orchestras  playing  classical
 
music,  that
 might  well  outnumber  oratorio  societies.
 
Chinese  opera  companies  are  now  established  in  at  least  seven  major
 
United  States  cities  where  they  perform  in  amiable  concord  side  by
 
side  with  the  larger  European/American  classic  opera  presentations.
 
The  planners  of  the  recent  Worlds  Fair  in  Knoxville  believed  th
 
musical  traditions  of  the  upland  south  were  such  impor
ar t  machors
 
of  the  region  that  they  set  aside  a special  section  of  the  Fair where
 
local  fiddlers,  ballad  singers  and  clog  dancers  performed  the  full
 
six  months  of  the  Fair.
 Indeed,  one  newspaper  reviewer  termed  the
 
folk  presentation  the  "class  act"  of  the  entire  Fair.
 
All  these  musics,  and  hundreds  more  I have  no  room  to  mention,
 
add  the  energy  and  charm of  variation  to  life  in  these  United
 
States  and  provide  for  cross-fertilization  and  excitement  in  the
 
development  of new musics  yet  unheard.
 It  is  to  the  self-interest
 
of  all  American  musicians,  classical  or  otherwise,  that  the  feisty,
 
independent  sounds  of  the  Cajun  button  accordion,  the  northern
 
Mississippi  black  fife  and  drum,  the  Comanche  flute,  the  Hmong  kieng
  
(progenitor  of  the  pipe  organ)  continue  to  refresh  our  ears.
 It  is
 
to  the  self-interest  of  all  American  musicians  that  our  distinctive
 
regional  musical  traditions  continue  welcoming  us  home,  with  one
 
kind  of music  in  the  Minnesota  Iron  Range  and  with  another  along  the
 
Texas  border.
 It  is  to  the  self-interest  of  American  musicians  that
 
we  reject  the  Coca  Cola  fantasy  of  a "national"  or  "world"  music
 
here we  all  sing  the  same  song  in  four-square  harmony.
 Let  us
 
'censure  and  delight  in  our  delicate  differences!
 
hut,  it  is  not  enough  to  cheer.
 Those  of  us  who  val se  the  many
 
musics  that  grace  our  nation  have  some  work  to  do  and  none  respon-
sibilities.
 The  Folk  Arts  Program  has,  during  the  past  several  years
 
discovered  and  proved  that  all  r
nusi(:s  thrive  under  pretty  much  th
 
same  conditions.
 The  sam e  support,  system  that  bolter  syrnrhonies  and
 
chorales  can  be  applied  to  our  ethnic  and  folk  musics.
 All  musics
 
need  to  be  introduced  with  excitement  and  enthusiasm  to  children  in
 
the  schools
. as  early  as  possible.
 All  musics  need  to  be  presented
 
to  the  widest  possible  public  through  phonograph  recordi ngs,  m uir
 
and  television  programs.
 They  all  need  to  he  treated  as  news,  to
 
he  written  about  and  advertised  in  newspaper, columns  and  the  poruiem
 
press.
 And  they  all  need  to  he  critically  examined  by  scholars  and
 
savants  charged  with  the  responsiblity  of keeping  standards  him .
 
Uhen  these  things  happen,  even  just  one  of  then,  the  i
.mnact  en
 
these  smaller  musical  systems  is  enormous.
 
The  major  Cajun  fiddler  of'  south'vost  frui
T s  ann  once  tol d  v
ie,
 
when  I asked,  that  the  thing  he  most  wanted  to  do  f
'nr  the  rest  of'
 
his  life  was  to  present  Cajun  music  in  the  schools  around  his  home,
 
to  explain  and  demonstrate  that  Cajun  music  has  a theoretical  system,
 
an  orchestral  organization,  an  improvisational  component  its  own
 
har moni c  rul es,  an d  a  repertoi re  of'  son g  and  real  noetic.  stature.
 
He  wanted  to  do  all  this  during  hi s
 he
 
been  told  by  his  teachers  when  he  was  a  child  in  these  same  schools
 
that  Cajuns  were  ignorant  folks  who  didn't  know  any  music  except
 
something  that  sounded  like  cats  caterwauling.
 And  his  eyes  fil l ed

finally  got  this  fine  gentleman  his  chance  to  perform  in  the  local
 
schools.
 I asked  him  after  a few  months  how  i
 t '.ias  goi n g.
 
"oh,  it's  lust  oondnrf i
l .
 You  should  se e  ho w  fi ne
 
the  children  feel  when  the:;
 hear  the  sonos  s
im
m  in
 
their  own  language  and  how  interested  they  get  in
 
the  instruments  and  the  way  they  fit  together.
 And
 
the  teachers  like  it  too.
 Oh,  it's  just  fine.
 But
 
there  is  one  thing  
 I' m  beginning  to  worry.
 i
low
 
that  they  know  that  their  music  is  real music  and  now
 
that  they' ve  learned  something  about  their  own  roots,
 
I don't  want  our  Cajun  children  growing  up  thinkinm
 
they're  the  only  kind  of  children  with  the  only  kind
 
of  music  in  the  world.
 Don't  you  think  we  should
 
start  to  work  on  getting  them  music  from  the  other
 
kind  of  people  who  live  in  Louisiana,  or  even  in
 
other  places  in  the  world?"
 
He  had  been  defined  into  the  magic  circle.
 And  as  he  had
 
brought  the  very  best  of  his  music  to  his  children,  he  could  now
 
welcome,  indeed  strive  for,  the  bringing  of  all  the  worlds'  rich
s
 
to  the  schools  of  southwest  Louisiana.
 I urge  Si I music  e
'i'm  ators
 
to  open  your  ears  and  hearts  to  the  sounds  around  you,  to  seek  out
 
the  many  quiet  musics  that  enliven  the  communities  where  you  li-e
 
and  work,  to  share  time  with  your  fellow  artists,  to  help  thorn
 
keep  their  standards  high,  their  repertoires  fresh  and  their
 
technique  poi
shed ,
 so  tnat  they  are  not  defeated  and  drowned  out
 
by  the  thousands  of  ioud - sn

if  you  doubtful  of  your  ability  to  recognize  the  very  best  -
-
and  you  should  only  sponsor  the  very  best  available  -
-
 there  are
 
scholars,  books,  instructional  offerings  to  help  you.
 But  open  the
 
doors  of  the  schools  and  let  the  musics  in.
 The  rewards  will  he
 
much  greater  than  you  think.

Fo'k1nr ,  world  m sic a,  and  sir
n 1ar  delights  in  a wide  variety  of
 
ducational  settings,  I found  mysn
f  enticed  into  a career  chance.
 
F joined  the  staff  of  the  National  Endowment  for  the  Arts,  a federal
 
granting  agency,  fr om  which  rather  specialized  position  I have  been
 
looking  about  at  the  lively,  exciting  and  uplifting  cultural  Jand-
scape  of  the  United  States  and  trying  to  think  how  it  might  become
 
even  more  lively,  more  exciting  and  more  uplifting.
 
My  particular  area  of  responsibility  was  and  is  folk  arts,  that
 
discipline  that  concerns  itself  with  the  art  forms  of  the  many
 
different  peoples  who  constitute  the  body  politic  of  the  United  States.
 
My  predecessor  had  laid  out  the  terrain;  an  advisory  body  of  scholars
 
was  in  place.
 We  were  ready  to  announce  ourselves  and  our  concerns.
 
Our  first  brochure  began  bravely:
 
) "The  folk  and  traditional  arts  are  those  that  have
 
grown  through  time  within  the  many  sub-groups  that
 
make  up  any  nation  -
-
 groups  that  identify  them-
selves  as  sharing  the  same  ethnic  heritage,  language,
 
occupat ion,  religion,  or  geographic  area.
 Every
 
Iroquois,  Louisiana  Cajun,  and  Mennonite  represents
 
a people  who  have  developed  a distinctive  expressive
 
system,  a body  of  important  works  of  art,  and  an
 
assembly  of  respected  practitioners  of  those  art
 
forms,  all  cherished  and  valuable.
 
Five  years  later,  the  basic  formulation  still  satisfies  us,
 
still,  I think,  thrills  us  a little.

He  wanted  to  do  all  this  during  his  retirement  years  because  he  had

that  Cajuns  were  ignorant  folks  who  didn't  know  any  music  except
 
something  that  sounded  like  cats  caterwauling.
 And  his  eyes  filled
 
with  tears  of  hurt  and  shame  as  he  told  me.
 Well,  the  Folk  Arts
 
Program,  along  with  a great  many  other  people  working  on  the  problem,
 
finally  got  this  fine  gentleman  his  chance  to  perform  in  the  local

 I asked  him  after  a few  months  how  it  was  going.
 
"Oh,  it's  just  wonderful.

May 1983
 
EASTERN, NORTHWEST, AND SOUTHWESTERN DIVISIONS CHOOSE NEW PRESIDENTS-ELECT
 
Ballots were counted in the MENC headquarters office March 9 for three division
 
president-elect races.
 Winners Joseph R.  Sugar, Eastern; Lynn E.  Sjolund, Northwest;
 
and Mollie Autry,  Southwestern begin six-year terms,  commencing in July 1983, as
 
presidents-elect;  as division presidents from 1985-87 and members of the MENC
 
National Executive Board and National Assembly;  and as vice-presidents until  1989.
 
Sugar is a district director of music education for the Hewlett-Woodxnere Public
 
Schools in New York,  with thirty years of teaching and administrative experience
 
with Long Island University,  Indiana University, Upsala College, Dowling College,
 
and public schools in Matawan, New Jersey, and Bethpage, New York.
 A past
 
president of the New York State School Music Association, he will lead the largest
 
of six divisions with 13,000 members.
 
Sjolund is chairman of the Fine Arts Department and director of vocal

ASSOCIATIONS PROTEST REGULATIONS ON POLITICAL ADVOCACY BY NONPROFIT GROUPS
 
Receipt of several thousand comments from association and corporation executives
 
forced the Office of Management and Budget to withdraw proposed changes to Circular
 
A-122,  "Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations," which concerns the use of
 
federal funds for political activity. The Internal Revenue Service's code of
 
"influencing legislation" prohibits nonprofit organizations from using more than a
 
small percentage of their total funds for political purposes, but this modification
 
would have cut into the code further by detailing where funding for any political
 
activity must originate.
 
The revisions would have labeled as political activity any effort to affect rule
 
making, to influence government decisions by policy statements,  to display art
 
work with a political statement, or to pay a staff member's salary who engages in
 
writing a letter to a congressman.
 
News Brief
 
NEW MEXICO CONSIDERS NO-ARTS BILL
 
SB55, a bill in the New Mexico
 
Legislature directs the State Board of
 
Education (SBE) to prescribe minimum
 
graduation requirements for students in
 
grades nine through twelve, including
 
twenty-two units covering most fields
 
except music and the arts. According
 
to Donald M. Hardisty, Past President
 
of the New Mexico Music Educators
 
Association and current President of
 
the New Mexico Alliance for Arts Edu-
cation the bill has been tabled in the
 
Education Committee and the board of
 
education has been directed to make
 
further recommendations.
 
"One problem," he says, "is that the
 
SBE has already made recommendations
 
that eliminate ninth-grade music and
 
the arts. The intent of 5B55 is
 
impressive in that it attempts to
 
raise standards and to prepare students
 
for the technological age, but
 
unfortunately, it follows the trend of
 
current federal bills to fund [
only]
 
science and math teachers .
... Encouraged
 
by the clout from these federal bills,
 
if SB55 passes in New Mexico, within a
 
few years most state arts teachers
 
will lose their jobs.
 
"Emphasis in only the sciences and
 
math will lead society in the wrong
 
direction," Hardisty stated, "away
 
from world peace and stability. By
 
forgetting to support the practical
 
arts, legislators fail to recognize a
 
vital part of education.  Deletion
 
would weaken the very roots of our
 
culture."
 
ROBERTS MAKES JAZZ HALL OF FAME
 
Past MENC Southwest Division Pres-
ident John T. Roberts received the 1983
 
Hall of Fame award from the National
 
Association of Jazz Educators (NAJE).
 
Supervisor of music in the Denver
 
schools for twenty-five years and
 
an active music educator for more than
 
fifty, Roberts added jazz to the cur-
riculum as early as 1960. He prepared
 
MENC's first jazz session at the 1
963
 
conference.  A cofounder of NAJE, he
 
was its president from 1
970 to 1
972,
 
organizing state NAJE units for MENC.

SEGREGATION ON THE INCREASE
 
Voluntary and mandatory integration
 
plans have not been successful, according
 
to School Desegregation Patterns in the
  
States, Large Cities, and Metropolitan
 
Areas,  1968-1980 by Gary Orfield, a
 
University of Chicago political
 
scientist. Schools within large cities
 
show the highest segregation, with six
 
of the ten largest urban districts
 
increasing in minority student make-up
 
from one-half to two-thirds of the
 
population during the period covered.
 
Enrollments for the fifty largest
 
central-city schools in the country
 
showed both nonwhite student majorities
 
and a decline in white students.
 
"IOWA PRIDE" SHOWN IN SONG CONTEST
 
The Iowa Music Educators Association
 
(IMEA), along with the Iowa State
 
Education Association (ISEA), sponsored
 
a contest that resulted in widespread
 
recognition, a new song, and enhanced
 
state pride--at a cost of $25 to IMEA.
 
In December 1
980, ISEA Public
 
Relations Specialist Bill Sherman
 
suggested to James Crowder, current pres-
ident of IMEA, that IMEA provide a theme
 
song for a "Take Pride in Iowa Schools"
 
campaign.
 IMEA organized and judged
 
the contest; ISEA provided a $500 prize.
 
The winning entry--"Iowa Pride," by
 
elementary music teacher Sara A.
 
Grabenstein Otto--was honored at the
 
1
982 IMEA state banquet.  The song was
 
arranged for chorus, band, and
 
orchestra, and parts were printed by
 
ISEA and distributed to Iowa schools,
 
senators, and congressmen.
 
HEADQUARTERS STAFF CONTACTS

ESSAY CONTEST FOR STUDENT MEMBERS
 
"Why Music Is Basic To Education"
 
is the theme of a student-member essay
 
contest that will be held during the
 
next school year.  Winning essays in
 
the competition, which must be between
 
500 and 750 words, will be printed in
 
MEJ.  MENC student advisors will

Harriet Hair, who is organizing the
 
contest.
 
MARKET MUSIC EDUCATION
 
A marketing research class at
 
Georgia State University found an
 
alarming lack of knowledge about school
 
music programs among parents and
 
community members.  Under the direction
 
of music educator Sally Monsour, the
 
class conducted a telephone survey of
 
193 parents and 193 members of the
 
general population in the Atlanta area.
 
Almost 30 percent of the parents
 
questioned were somewhat concerned
 
about dropping music education programs
 
from the school curriculum.  More than
 
59 percent were deeply concerned
 
about music cuts. More surprising
 
survey results showed that of the
 
general population group, 47 percent
 
said they were somewhat concerned about
 
elimination of music education, while
 
about 30 percent expressed deep concern
 
for continuation of music education.
 
The survey reports, "There exists
 
within the population of parents and
 
at large sufficient support to maintain
 
current music education programs."
 
Recommendations included bringing
 
music programs into a more visible
 
position in the parents' minds. One-
tenth of the parents of music education
 
students were not aware of their
 
children's participation in the music
 
education program. To remedy this, the
 
report suggested parents' days, open
 
houses, performances in public places
 
as well as during activities involving
 
parents at school.
 
The report emphasized organizing a
 
continuing marketing effort of music
 
education. The warning: "Plan and
 
act," don't react.

AU REVOIR
 
A colleague recently said, "The last
 
rites, provided that you are walking
 
away and not being carried, are the
 
bragging rights." If that is indeed the
 
case, let me reflect on four remarkable
 
and personally rewarding years.
 
We've lost a few, but we've won a
 
lot.  We have gone places, participated
 
in events, faced
 
issues, and achieved
 
goals that we were
 
told were beyond our
 
reach. As a result,
 
the foundation now
 
exists upon which we
 
can continue to build
 
and music education
 
can prosper.
 
There have been
 
dramatic changes in
 
the quality of
 
NEJ, which received both awards and
 
national recognition and is enjoyed
 
and anticipated by its readers.  We
 
have a much-needed public relations
 
program as a top priority, with an
 
ambitious but workable five-year plan.
 
Effective communication is reflected
 
in the development this year of a
 
networking program.
 
Efforts are underway to establish a
 
Research Center for Music Education at
 
MENC, to develop a National Music
 
Honor Society for high school students,
 
and to effectively market music
 
education to the public in this country
 
and throughout the world.
 
The headquarters operation has been
 
computerized, a variety of professional
 
management procedures are in place,
 
and MENC has operated in the black
 
each year. This but touches upon the
 
many positive changes at MENC during
 
the past four years. The future looks
 
bright for MENC and music education.
 
To all who have shared in these
 
achievements and meant so much to me,
 
thank you. For me, other opportunities
 
call and I must accept the challenge.
 
Au revoir.

HALF A MILLION BUTTONS LATER...  
The 1983 Music In Our Schools Week
 
(MIOSW) program underwent several
 
changes. To enable MENC to monitor
 
the program more efficiently, control
 
costs and revenue, and provide members
 
with more benefits, sales of MIOSW
 
materials were brought in-house.
 
Production began January 14 when
 
all orders were tabulated, and a
 
generous amount of overage was added.
 
MENC guaranteed that orders received by
 
the deadline would be processed and
 
delivered by February 28. Orders
 
received after the deadline were
 
processed on a first come, first
 
served basis until supplies were
 
exhausted.
 
Over 1
,600 orders were received.
 
Lapel stickers ranked as the most
 
requested item with 555,000 sold,
 
although buttons were not far behind
 
with sales of 525,000. Also distrib-
uted were 5,000 posters, 3
,700 iron-on
 
transfers, 3,500 banners, 3,500 memo
 
pads, and 2
,100 bumper stickers.
 
As with any new endeavor there were
 
some rough spots. MENC will review
 
all aspects of the program to refine
 
and improve operations for next year,
 
the tenth annual Music In Our Schools
 
Week. Suggestions are welcome.

WILL CORPORATE GIFTS TO ARTS DECLINE?  
Will corporate charitable giving be
 
reduced because of falling profits?
 
Will contributions be shifted from
 
the arts to social programs because
 
of the recession and the Reagan
 
administration's call to the public
 
sector to subsidize health and welfare
 
programs? An article in the New York
 
Times (Sunday, February 20) questioned
 
three major corporate donors. The
 
conclusion is mixed; some major com-
panies have cut or soon may cut arts
 
donations, but a strong trend toward
 
this has not yet been established.
 
The Exxon Corporation gave away
 
more than $50 million last year,
 
including $
10.8 million to the arts.
 
The level of total contributions
 
will remain the same this year, but
 
the amount to the arts will be reduced
 
by $3 million.
 In addition, profits
 
to the company fell by 13 percent in
 
1982, which will eventually be reflected
 
in the level of contributions.
 
Minneapolis's Dayton-Hudson Corp-
oration presents a different story.
 
Its generous regional support of the
 
arts is expected to continue.  There
 
has been some criticism from the
 
community and employees that the
 
company's approximately $4.5 million
 
contribution is inappropriate in the
 
present economy, but manager of
 
corporate giving Margaret Wurtele is
 
quoted as saying, "We feel that the
 
needs in the arts are as great as ever."
 
Philip Morris is currently
 
underwriting a $3 million exhibit of
 
Vatican art.  Partly as a result of
 
this grant, growth in arts contributions
 
by the company may stop for awhile. In
 
the future, cultural programs may be
 
deemphasized in favor of social programs.

I
t a
ll happened at the NFA convention.
 
These were their actual words as they
 
d
iscovered the Bundy H—a f
lute so good
 
i
t
 catches the most critical p
layers o
ff
 
guard.
 
W hat has t
ransformed the f
amiliar
 
Bundy f
lute? All o
f the m t
raced the
 
dramatic change to a
 l
ighter head j
oint
 
with a
 new l
ip p
late and b
low hole,
 
developed under the personal super-
v
ision o
f Mark Tho mas. Their s
tudied
 
comments varied as widely as their
 
spontaneous exclamations, touching on
 
t
imbre, tonal balance, projection,
 
dynamic range. Together they r
eflect a
 
comprehensive improvement over the
 
earlier Bundy —itself one o
f the most
 
popular s
tudent f
lutes i
n the world.
 
Until you have a
 chance to share
 
their d
iscovery, r
eme mber this: the most
 
f
requent co mment i
s that the Bundy H
 
p
lays l
ike a
 professional f
lute. And this: i
t
 
i
s priced f
or beginners.
