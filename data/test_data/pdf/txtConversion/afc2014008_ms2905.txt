When he was j

Dr. Townsend's Conundrum
 
I
)
R F
. H
. TO WNSEND, of Long
 
Beach, California, has i
nvented
 
a s
che me under which he s
ays
 
that 'hu manity will be f
orever r
elieved
 
f
ro m the f
ear o
f destitution and want."
 
Mr.  Mark  Sullivan  thinks that Dr.
 
Townsend  has  obtained  twenty-f
ive
 
million s
ignatures to petitions f
or h
is
 
s
che me  and  t
hat Congress  may  be
 
driven t
o adopt i
t because the Ameri-
can people will not have enough co m-
mon s
ense to s
ee what i
s wrong with i
t
.
 
The Townsend p
lan i
s very s
imple.
 
I
t p
roposes:
 
1
. rhat every man and wo man
 
over s
ixty years o
f age shall s
top
 
wt'rtiiig f
or gain.
 
2
. rhat the Federal Govern ment
 
shall  pay  each  man  and  each
 
wo man over s
ixty a monthly pen-
s
ion o
f $200, provided, f
irst, the
 
pensioner i
s not an habitual c
ri m-
I
t
ial, and provided, s
econd, that he
 
o
r she will t
ake an oath to spend
 
the whole $200 within thirty days.
 
3
. That the cost of the pensions
 
be raised by q
.
 general sales t
ax.
 
Dr. Townsend believes that of the
 
10,300,000 persons e
ligible for the pen-
s
ion, 8
,000,000 will apply for i
t
.  At
 
$2,400 a year the annual cost of the
 
Townsend p
lan would, therefore, be
 
about $
19,200,000,000, p
lus the cost of
 
ad ministering i
t
, or abbut twenty b
il-
l
ion dollars. This su m has to be raised
 
by a
 general sales t
ax. Retail sales this
 
year have been about thirty b
illion dol-
l
ars. So the Townsend p
lan would have
 
meant that f
or every dollar any one
 
spent i
n a
 s
tore this year he would have
 
had to pay an additional s
eventy c
ents
 
tax. Thus, f
or exa mple, a
 t
en c
ent l
oaf
 
of bread would have had to cost s
even-
teen cents, a twenty-cent gallon of
 
gasoline would have had to cost thirty-
four c
ents, a s
ix hundred dollar car
 
would have had to cost over a thou-
sand dollars.  A man earning f
ifteen
 
hundred a
 year would have had to g
ive
 
up about s
ix hundred dollars of i
t i
n
 
taxes.  Persons on r
elief, now r
eceiving
 
on the average $25 a
 month, would have
 
had their purchasing power r
edu 9d to
 
$
15 a month. A d
isabled voterad r
e-
ceiving a
 pension o
f $50 a
 month would
 
have been t
axed until he had only $30
 
a month to spend.  Even Dr. Town-
s
end's pensioners would not have had
 
$200 a month t
o spend.  They would
 
have had l
ess than 8
120 a month f
or
 
more than $80 would have been t
aken
 
in t
axes.
 
Any one can f
igure out f
or h
i mself
 
the mini mu m that the Townsend p
lan
 
would cost hi m; he has only to sub-
t
ract about two-f
ifths f
ro m h
is ex-
penditures.  For every 8100 he now
 
spends, he would, under the Townsend
 
p
i'n have $60 to spend.  The rough
 
arith metic o
f the matter i
s as f
ollows:
 
$60 p
lus a
 70", t
ax on $60 equals $
102.
 
.
 S
 *
 
W'ry, then, does Mr. Townsend think
 
i
i" h'  f
ound a way o
f making every
 
r
''her?  His a
rgu ment i
s a
s f
ol-
Or 810,000 pensions f
or persons over
 
thirty?  What can be s
aid against these
 
proposals that must not a
lso be said
 
against the Townsend p
lan?
 
Dr. Townsend's e
rror l
ies i
n f
orget-
t
ing the s
imple t
ruth that so me one
 
must produce the wealth which i
s con-
su med by the non-producers, be they
 
i
nfants, o
ld people, s
ick people, the
 
une mployed, the i
dle r
ich, or the c
ri m-
i
nal c
lasses,  I
f Dr. Townsend's medi-
c
ine were a
 good r
e medy, the more peo-
p
le the country could f
ind t
o support
 
i
n i
dleness the better of
f i
t would be.
 
Dr.,Townsend i
s i
n my opinion a
 
public benefactor.  He has succeeded
 
i
n inventing a conundru m which r
e-
duces to absurdity a whole mass o
f
 
i
deas that have had g
reat vogue during
 
the depression.  So me o
f these i
deas
 
a
re current in f
or ms which make i
t
 
harder to detect the catch than i
t i
s i
n
 
Dr. Townsend's sche me. They a
ll, how-
ever, derive f
ro m the sa me notion,
 
which i
s that i
f people worked l
ess and
 
spent more, they would be r
icher.
 
Business men have had the i
dea that
 
they must curtail output and r
aise
 
prices.  Organized l
abor has had the
 
i
dea that i
t could make work f
or a
ll
 
by r
educing hours and r
aising wages.
 
The f
ar mers have been paid f
or r
e-
s
tricting output.  Now I do not wish
 
to say that there a
re not specific i
n-
dustries, which i
n r
elation to o
ther i
n-
dustries, were over-expanded.  A c
lear
 
case, I
 think, i
s wheat, o
f which a
ctu-
a
lly toc'nuch i
s produced, and a
 s
ound
 
a
rgu ment can be made f
or paying a
 
bounty to wheat f
ar mers to help the m
 
in the t
ransition t
o so me o
ther k
ind
 
o
f far ming.  But the exceptions do not
 
make a
 rule.  I
f everybody t
ried t
o pay
 
everybody e
lse f
or not producing, the
 
country would be bound t
o, be much
 
poorer.
 
The experi ment has been t
ried, and
 
the country i
s much poorer.  In the de-
pression men have been une mployed
 
and f
actories have been i
dle and l
ess
 
goods have been produced.  The de-
pression i
tself i
s the most drastic l
imi-
t
ation of production ever experienced.
 
The population on r
elief i
s the l
argest
 
nu mber of people ever supported i
n
 
i
dleness. I
f there were any t
ruth what-
ever in the theory that a nation can
 
beco me prosperous by not producing,
 
then the depression i
tself should have
 
made us roaring r
ich.  Dr. Townsend
 
wishes to r
e move f
ro m productive l
abor
 
a paltry 8
,000,000 persons.  When the
 
depression was going s
trong, 1
6,000,000
 
persons had been r
e moved f
ro m pro-
ductive l
abor.  I
t d
id not make us
 
prosperous.  And f
or a
 v
ery s
imple r
ea-
son.  Those who s
till had j
obs had to
 
support those who d
id not have the m.
 
Less wealth was produced and so the
 
s
tandard o
f l
iving had t
o f
all.

When John Lomax got on
