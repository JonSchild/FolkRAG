Abstract: Alma and her grown children were all raised in Gibson County, Indiana, as part of the
historically Black Lyles Station farming community near Princeton, Indiana. Alma Jones was
raised on her parents’ farm in Gibson County, and attended college where she was valedictorian
of her class. Alma’s mother started a racially integrated 4H Club in Lyles Station, because the
other 4H chapter in the county would not accept African American children. Brent owns a
construction company and helped with the building of the Lyles Station museum. All three of
them are open about the racism in the area, and the issues that this has caused for them and their
community.
