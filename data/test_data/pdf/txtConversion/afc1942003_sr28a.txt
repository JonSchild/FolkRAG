"Dear Mr. President", Detroit, Michigan, January or February 1942
AFS 6428A
Harry H. Sanger: Mr. President, this is Henry H. Sanger, president of the Manufacturers National
Bank of Detroit speaking, to assure you of our wholehearted support in assisting to the utmost of
our ability in financing the war. In fifty years of active banking here I have seen Detroit rise to meet
many crises and emergencies. And never has she failed to get more than was asked or expected of
her. Thus far our bank has received over fifteen thousand applications for defense bonds, stamps,
and tax notes for an aggregate of nearly twenty-five million dollars. This is typical of what all the
banks of Detroit and Michigan are doing along this line. They have been behind the defense bond
sales since long before Pearl Harbor and have an outstanding record of sales. But we are not resting
nor will we do so until our intensified efforts alongside of and supporting industry, workers, the
government, and you Mr. President have achieved final victory.
