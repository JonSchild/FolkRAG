Department of Anthropology
 
California State University at Northridge
 
Northridge, California  91324
 
Dear Lynn:
 
This is a formal request for an additional year and a half of
 
leave without pay from my duties in the Anthropology Department.
 
This would mean that I would return to the University at the
 
beginning of the academic year 1978-9.
 
As we discussed over the phone, the position I propose to accept
 
for this time period is as the director of the Folk Arts program
 
at the National Endowment for the Arts.
 It is a position of
 
considerable responsibility.
 I will be handling a grants budget
 
of close to a million dollars; additionally, I am specifically
 
charge with developing, in conjunction with the new Folk Life
 
Center at the Library of Congress and the Folk Arts program at
 
the Smithsonian Institution, a five year program for further
 
outreach in the field of the traditional arts.
 
As I told you, I had really been looking forward to returning
 
to the Department this spring.  My natural cowardice in the face
 
of the new responsibilities involved in this appointment has
 
been overcome, however, by the urging of senior colleagues in
 
the American Folklore Society who feel that my Washington experience
 
in the past year and the general thrust of my past career will
 
stand me in good stead.
 I also feel that this appointment will
 
increase my eventual usefulness to the university and the department.
 
Outside of whatever prestige might accrue, I shall be dealing
 
directly with a large number of ethnic groups and Native American
 
tribes, and the experience gained should add significantly to the
 
breadth and depth of my teaching.
 
Finally, the position entails a great deal of travel, as I shall
 
be making site visits all over the country.
 I am sure these will
 
take me to California with reasonable frequency, and I will certainly
 
take advantage of this to drop by and visit with my old friends on
 
campus at every opportunity.
 
I
'm really grateful both to you, the department and the Dean for
 
permission to extend my leave.  My very best wishes for a smooth
 
and productive academic year, and please give my warmest personal
 
regards to all the departmental faculty and other old friends.
 
ncerely,
 
- o--/ 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Dear Lynn:
 
I promised you a final decision by the first of the year.
 
I
'm afraid I won't be coming back to CSUN next fall.
 This
 
work is simply too much fun and too interesting, and I think
 
it is on the point of expanding sharply.
 I can.t.'bear to
 
leave it just now;  I want to stick around and see what
 
happens to the program that I and others have started.
 
In a year or two I will be out of ideas in this area of
 
activity,  I suspect, and I will start thinking about coming
 
home.
 I do not intend to sell my house, at least as yet,
 
and I still think of California as home base.
 So, who knows,
 
maybe you will take me on as a part-time instructor in a
 
few years?  Or,  if you think the dean would hold still for
 
yet another year of delaying action, I should be most happy.
 
My major regret is the loss of close association with friends
 
and colleagues with whom I have worked so long.
 I am proud
 
of my past association with the Anthropology Department at
 
CSUN, and I hope we will always keep in touch.
 Please give
 
my warm wishes and affection to all my old friends.
 
Yours,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

P.S.
 Barbara Rahm has volunteered to help clean out my
 
office files and will be in touch with you soon.
 Should you
 
need to reach her, she has moved out of my house and is now
 
living at 1736 Garth Avenue, Los Angeles 90035;  telephone:
 
838-4394.
 Also, if there are forms I should fill in or other
 
formal letters I should write,  I would appreciate your lett:Lng
 
me know.
 Mail addressed to my home  (
address above)  arrives
 
more speedily than that coming to the office.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
SMITHSONIAN OFFICIAL NAMED TO HEAD
 
ARTS ENDOWMENT'S FOLK ARTS PROGRAM
 
WASHINGTON, D.C.  -- The appointment of Bess Lomax Hawes,  former
 
Deputy Director for Presentations of the Smithsonian's
 
Festival of American Folklife,  as Director of the Folk
 
Arts Program of the National Endowment for the Arts was
 
announced today by Nancy Hanks,  Chairman of the Endowment.
 
"Bess Hawes is a distinguished folklorist,  who will bring
 
considerable knowledge and many years of experience to the
 
Folk Arts Program," Miss Hanks said.
 "As its Director,  she
 
will have responsibility for those grants programs which were
 
formally established in 1974 to meet the demands of Americans
 
as more and more people were attracted to the richness and
 
diversity of our traditional art forms."

The Program makes federal matching funds available for
 
presentations of folk arts,  for development of organizations
 
involved in documentation and/or presentation of folk arts,
 
and for efforts to renew folk arts within a community.
 
Mrs. Hawes has previously served with the Endowment as
 
Co-Chairman of the Jazz/Folk/Ethnic Advisory Panel of the
 
Music Program and as a member of the Folk Arts Panel.
 
She took leave from her post as Professor of Anthropology
 
at California State University at Northridge to join the
 
Smithsonian staff in July 1975.
 At the Smithsonian,  she
 
planned and assisted with operations of the Institution's
 
Festival of American Folklife held this past summer in
 
celebration of the bicentennial.
 
Mrs. Hawes has taught adult and college courses in anthro-
pology and folklore subjects for 25 years,  the last 10
 
of which have been at California State University at Northridge.
 
She earned a B.A.  in Sociology at Bryn Mawr College,  Pa.,
 
graduating cum laude;  and an M.A.  in Folklore  (within the
 
Department of Anthropology)  at the University of California
 
at Berkeley.
 
She is co-author with Mrs.  Bessie Jones of a book on the games,
 
plays,  songs and stories derived from the Afro-American
 
heritage entitled Step it Down, and has published widely

in the folklore field.
 Film and video work has also been
 
extensive,  her latest film being "Say,  Old Man,  Can You
 
Play the Fiddle?" which documents the style and technique
 
of a traditional Missouri fiddler.
 
In 1969, Mrs. Hawes received the Distinguished Professor
 
Award given by the California State College system.
 She
 
is past President of the California Folklore Society and
 
past Vice President of the American Folklore Society.
 
Mrs. Hawes comes from a family of distinguished folklorists.
 
Her father,  John A.  Lomax did pioneer field work in folk
 
songs,  collecting and publishing the first cowboy songs
 
ever printed,  as well as many other standard anthologies.
 
Much of his later career was
 spent at the Library of
 
Congress where he was the Honorary Curator and Consultant
 
to the Archive of American Folk Song.
 
The National Endowment for the Arts is an independent agency
 
of the Federal government which was created by Congress in
 
1965 to encourage the nation's cultural resources.
 It is
 
advised by the 26 Presidentially-appointed members of the
 
National Council on the Arts.
