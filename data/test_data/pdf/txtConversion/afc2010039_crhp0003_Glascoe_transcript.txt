[START RECORDING] 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Today is Wednesday,  
01:00:09 
November 17th, 2010.  And I am 
sitting with Dr. Myrtle Gonza Glascoe 
[phonetic] for an oral history 
interview on her involvement in the 
Civil Rights Movement.  Dr. Glascoe, 
you were born and raised in 
Washington D.C., can you tell me 
about some of the early instances in 
your life that contributed to your 
involvement in the movement? 
01:00:44 
DR. GLASCOE:  Right off the top of my 
head it's hard to think of things 
that may have contributed to me going 
into the movement.  My family wasn't 
very political.  I honestly don't—
it's hard to think of anything.  But 
I was always, as my Godmother would 
say, I was always too frank.  
Whatever I thought I said and I had 
to learn how to not do that, you  
01:01:17 
know, because if I saw things and 
they were not right I made it clear 
that I did not agree and so.  But

right now I don't think of anything 
from my childhood that led to me  
01:01:33 
coming into the movement. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  So even as a child you 
were pretty honest and straight 
forward? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Oh I was very honest, 
yeah.  And I was also get up and go 
because my brother and my sister used 
to make jokes about me, they would 
say she always has money.  And you 
know we had to bargain with my dad to  
01:01:56 
get money and so—he didn't give us an 
allowance but I would go to the 
grocery store and I would carry 
orders, I would take groceries for 
people to their house for a quarter.  
And then when I got to where I had a 
bicycle I would do that too, I would 
put the groceries on the bicycle and 
take them for a quarter.  That's the 
reason they said I always had money  
01:02:21 
because I would make a little money.  
Then sometimes I would come to my 
father and I would say, well you know

I want to go to the carnival.  The 
carnival came to D.C. I think once a  
01:02:30 
year and I would tell my dad I want 
to go to the carnival and then I 
would tell him—I said what I need is 
six dollars to go to the carnival but 
I already have three so all you have 
to do is give me three, so he was 
willing to do that. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Well it sounds like you 
were straight forward, you said what 
you wanted and you were able to  
01:02:50 
negotiate— 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Exactly. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  --what you got.  So you 
take kind of that straight forward 
nature, you graduated from two of the 
finest African American educational 
institutions in the country, Dunbar 
High School and Howard University. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Yes. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Were there instances at  
01:03:05 
Dunbar or Howard that inspired you to 
become involved in the struggle for 
civil rights?

DR. GLASCOE:  I don't think of any in 
particular.  Let me see at Dunbar, no  
01:03:19 
I don't think of any.  But you know 
the thing that interests me about 
that is people, especially my 
classmates at Dunbar, when they see 
me, when we go to our reunions and 
stuff they always tell me that I 
always had something going.  I was 
always making fun or doing stuff that 
was kind of not quite acceptable.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  Mm-hmm. 
01:03:43 
DR. GLASCOE:  But anyway I don't 
remember anything at Dunbar.  Let me 
see at Dunbar— 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Were there any clubs or 
organizations or were there 
discussions amongst students about 
civil rights issues? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  No.  And at the time I 
just—I wasn’t into that stuff, I was 
just going to school. 
01:04:06 
INTERVIEWER:  Mm-hmm. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  And I was going to 
school and I wasn’t doing my best, I

was just going to school and I was 
getting by.  But I mean I remember my  
01:04:15 
English class I enjoyed that.  And I 
remember one occasion where I knew 
that this young man had—and I read 
the Esquire magazine and I read—my 
father used to get a whole lot of 
stuff, you know the Life magazine, he 
got all three newspapers and I read 
it all.  And so this particular 
classmate of mine, we had to write an 
essay and so he read his essay and I  
01:04:42 
recognized it as an essay I had read 
in the Esquire magazine and so I told 
the teacher about that.  And so—but 
anyway.  I don't think that 
particularly speaks to me being 
involved in the movement. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  What about your time at 
Howard.  So many people talk about 
college as an opportunity to kind of 
expand their horizons and whether  
01:05:07 
it's through activities or courses, 
can you pick a moment where there's 
certain things that really attracted

movement?

movement or also anything because you 
never know what kind of spurs you 
along. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  I hate to say it. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Nothing particular? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  I went to school and I 
partied. 
01:05:32 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay.  So you were 
living the young college experience. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Exactly, yeah.  I mean—
and I didn't realize at the time how 
good of student I was.  I had this 
great facility for going to class and 
taking notes and reading my notes 
before an exam and getting an 
excellent grade. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Mm-hmm. 
01:05:55 
DR. GLASCOE:  And so in these years 
people have said to me how smart I 
was and how they like to be in class

with me and to hear me say things.  
But anyway there was nothing  
01:06:08 
political going on in my life and I 
think about it a lot that there was 
so much political going on in the 
city that I knew nothing about but 
anyway.  I'm trying to remember. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  So what happened after 
college, what did you do next? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  I took a teaching 
position at a Catholic high school 
in—right after college I took a—see  
01:06:39 
I was a health and physical education 
major. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  I took a teaching 
position right after college at a 
boarding school for young black woman 
and that might have fired me up 
because I was aware of how 
discriminatory the nuns were to our 
young girls.  And they had these  
01:07:04 
strict rules and regulations, they 
wouldn't let the girls dance or if 
they did let them dance they screened

all their records.  And the records 
that the girls really wanted to dance  
01:07:15 
to they couldn't dance to those.  And 
so I was a health and physical 
education teacher and one of my phys 
ed sessions was devoted to dancing 
and I saw to it that the records that 
the girls wanted to dance to they got 
to dance to those records.  And of 
course that probably added to the 
fact that there was some other things 
that happened and they asked me to  
01:07:44 
leave before the end of the year.  I 
had a young lady to ask me one day in 
class could she get pregnant by 
kissing and so I stopped the class 
and I diagramed how she could get 
pregnant. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  And they didn't like 
that? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  No, not at all.  And so 
anyway they didn't get rid of me  
01:08:07 
right away but I also was expected to 
go to mass and I would go to mass but 
I couldn't handle it and so I stopped

going to mass.  And then one day I 
was sitting in my room and I was  
01:08:24 
knitting, I took up knitting while I 
was there because it was an isolated 
place and my room was way up on the 
top of this castle like building.  
And I was knitting and a knock came 
on the door, it was the Mother 
Superior and the principal of the 
school and they both said to me they 
had prayed for me and prayed for me 
and prayed for me.  And they had come  
01:08:50 
to this unfortunate conclusion that I 
had to go and they said you have to 
go by tonight.  And so I then said to 
them well this money that I'm making 
here is scheduled for me to go back 
to graduate school and if you cut me 
off now I won't be able to do that.  
And so by the time I finished they 
agreed to pay me for the rest of the 
year, just leave. 
01:09:15 
INTERVIEWER:  Still the negotiator. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Anyway.  And so I have 
no consciousness of that moving me to

the movement.  But I think to the 
fact that I was feeling oppressed and  
01:09:31 
frustrated and angry and whatever. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  So after that first job 
was there a point where you had an 
awakening or consciousness that you 
wanted to become more involved? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Well it was a few years 
later I had—I went back to school of 
social work in 1958, I took my degree 
at the University of Pennsylvania 
School of Social Work in 1960.  And I  
01:10:19 
was working at the Rosewood State 
Hospital outside of Baltimore as a 
social worker, you know I did social 
group work and social case work with 
the families of the children that I 
served.  And one day I was at lunch 
and one of my co-workers says to me 
why don't you come down to the 
meeting tonight, I said what meeting, 
he said—he was the chairman of  
01:10:48 
Baltimore CORE.  And so he invited me 
to come to the meeting and I went to 
the meeting and I got involved.  And

so I didn't believe in picketing and 
so I refused—because I didn’t  
01:11:04 
believe in non-violence so I refused 
to walk the picket line.  But I would 
come and I would do all kinds of 
things behind the scenes, I would 
drive people places, I would do 
support work and all kinds of stuff 
like that but I just wouldn't walk 
the picket line.  And so one day they 
said to me come on and go with us, 
we're going to sit in and I said sit  
01:11:27 
in where, they said they were going 
to the White Coffee Pot and that was 
one of the places that we were not 
allowed to go.  And so I went with 
them to the White Coffee Pot and as 
soon as we sat down there was this 
guy who got up and the guy came to 
us, he had grease on him it seemed 
like from the top of his head to the 
bottom of his feet, dirty apron,  
01:11:52 
greasy hair and he read this thing to 
us which said we had to get up and 
go.  And so the intention was that we

would get up and go and so we got up 
and we left.  And I was so mad, I  
01:12:08 
could feel that anger all the way 
home, I could feel the anger.  And I 
just—anyway it was like a rod of 
steel was put up my back and I can't 
even describe how I felt, it was that 
burn that turned me on.  And so from 
that point on I got involved in 
picketing and I never got arrested 
but you know we were doing Route 40 
things at that time.  And the Route  
01:12:46 
40 demonstrations and people—you know 
what I was surprised to learn once I 
got involved was that when someone 
was going to go to jail they made a 
decision to go to jail, to actually 
go and do what they were not supposed 
to do and refuse to remove 
themselves.  Like if we had wanted to 
go to jail that day we would have not 
gotten up and left the restaurant and  
01:13:18 
then the police would have come and 
arrested us.  As a matter of fact 
there were five police outside

waiting to arrest us.  So anyway—what 
was I saying? 
01:13:53 
INTERVIEWER:  We were talking about 
how it was deliberate— 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Yeah.  So anyway I had 
not known that.  So whenever we would 
go to different places where we were 
planning to sit in on Route 40 then 
there would be certain people who had 
come and they had brought their 
toothbrush and whatever they thought 
they needed to spend the night in  
01:14:20 
jail.  And so I never would agree to 
that, I didn't want to be in jail, I 
didn't want to be arrested but I 
would go and do other—I would support 
that, I would picket, when it was 
time to get arrested I would leave 
with a whole lot of—there were other 
people that would leave too.  So that 
was my introduction to the movement.  
And in that process I remember going  
01:14:46 
over to Howard and picking up folks 
like Courtland Cox and driving them 
to stuff we were doing on Route 40,

and Bill Mahoney, you're probably not 
familiar with those names.  But I  
01:14:59 
remember going up there and picking 
them up.  You know it was about these 
are the youth and they need support 
to get where they're going and that 
kind of stuff.  Because I was still a 
professional social worker and I saw 
myself a little bit back from the 
circle of civil rights workers. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  And so anyway. 
01:15:22 
INTERVIEWER:  I mean it seems like 
there was an evolution in the levels 
of your involvement.  And I just 
wanted to go back to something that 
you had said first when you didn't 
want to picket and you didn't believe 
in non-violence.  Can you kind of 
explain what you meant by that?  And 
then you get to the point where you 
do want to picket and then there's  
01:15:44 
certain levels, was it part of your 
attitude evolving or--? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  It didn't make any

sense to me to have people beating on 
you and you didn't—and you couldn't  
01:15:58 
respond to that in a like manner.  
And I had not attended any sessions 
where you were taught about non-
violence.  I had no knowledge of the 
philosophical approach to non-
violence and so that was my gut level 
response to it.  And when to work at 
CORE—went to work with Baltimore CORE 
I took those understandings with me.  
But as I said once I—I mean  
01:16:30 
I got so angry that this greasy 
uneducated person would come and 
stand there and tell me I wasn't as 
good as he was, get out my face, I 
will knock you down. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  So it sounds like to me 
it's more than just joining up, it's 
understand the philosophy and the 
rationale that it wasn't just a mass 
of people coming together, that it  
01:16:59 
was deliberate, it was planned, there 
was strategies— 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Exactly.

INTERVIEWER:  And as you got more 
involved, you—

DR. GLASCOE:  [interposing] And I 
came to understand— 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  --I could participate 
but that's my way.  If I don't 
understand I can't do it.  And things 
I don’t—you know some things in life 
I've had to come to say to myself 
well you're not going to understand 
it, you're still going to have to  
01:17:21 
accept it, it's there for you.  It's 
for you and you need it but even 
though you don't understand it.  And 
I'm talking about things spiritual 
right now, you know there's so many 
things that we don’t understand but 
they happen and we're surrounded by 
those things.  And it's to our 
benefit to choose to make ourselves 
available to those things, to open  
01:17:46 
ourselves to receive on that level, 
yes.

01:17:57 
DR. GLASCOE:  Well I left Baltimore 
in the summer of 1962 to take a 
position in Los Angeles, California 
working with emotionally disturb 
delinquency prone youth.  And when I 
got to Los Angeles I reconnected with 
CORE and I continued to attend CORE 
meetings and like that.  What was the 
question you asked me? 
 
INTERVIEWER:  How you ended up making  
01:18:41 
your way South. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Okay. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  So you went from 
Baltimore to L.A. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  I went from Baltimore 
to L.A. and then as part of my work—
you know as a result of being 
connected with Baltimore CORE I came 
in contact with Frederica Teer 
[phonetic] who was a national officer  
01:19:01 
for CORE.  And she would come down to 
Baltimore sometimes and we became 
good friends.  And so once I was in

Francisco and so I went up to visit  
01:19:14 
her one time and she introduced me to 
Mike Miller who was the Student 
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee 
chair of the support group there.  
And so I met him and I like that area 
and so when I completed my—I had a 
temporary job in Los Angeles, so when 
that job was over I moved to San 
Francisco and I began working with 
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating  
01:19:49 
Committee support network there.  And 
so right now were in early 1964 and 
so I went up there and so I was in 
San Francisco during the summer of 
1964.  And Mike would go down—Mike 
was in the South and he brought all 
kinds of stuff back for me to read.  
And so in effect—I mean it's almost 
as if he had a plan to educate me, I 
don't know that he did, but all the  
01:20:22 
stuff that he brought back, he 
brought back lots of papers and all 
those things and I read, it was like

I was eating dinner every day, I was 
reading so much, I enjoyed it.  And I  
01:20:34 
got to understand what people were 
trying to do in the South.  And then 
from time to time somebody would come 
out and so I got to meet lots of 
people, I got to meet Larry—Lawrence 
Guyot and Ivanhoe Donaldson and Mrs. 
Hamer.  One time we had a workshop 
and Mrs. Hamer came and I had to 
drive her around in my car and I was 
so excited, I was just thrilled.  And  
01:21:01 
she was just as down to earth as she 
could be.  As soon we got away from 
all the folks she pulled out her 
tobacco and she stuck it in her mouth 
and she says, "Now I can get me a 
good chew."  Anyway.  And so that 
spring I was on a committee to choose 
people to go South and so I'm still 
not at the point yet where I have 
released my professional social work  
01:21:29 
stuff, I'm still working as a social 
worker.  And so I'm on this 
committee—and you see the thing that

happened was that during the summer 
of 1964 so many young white people  
01:21:43 
went down and many of them did not 
want to leave and so there was a lot 
of concern about who came—who would 
come down for the '65 summer and how 
would decisions be made to try to get 
more people who would fit in better 
with the way things were.  And so I 
was on a committee to help to choose 
those people and in the midst of all 
that I decided I was going to go.   
01:22:14 
And actually my decision was 
facilitated by this young Chinese 
woman who worked in the office with 
me and she had been traveling in 
Europe with her husband and I think 
two children.  And her husband died 
and there she was no husband and the 
two children.  And so she had to come 
back and she had to pick her life up 
and keep going.  And so she and I got  
01:22:42 
into this conversation, I was telling 
her how much I was attracted to being 
a part of the movement.  And so she

just looked at me and she says, well 
why can’t you go?  I started thinking  
01:22:55 
about all the reasons I couldn't go 
and she says do you have any bills?  
No I don’t.  Do you have a husband?  
No I don't.  Do you have any 
children?  No I don't.  And so then 
she says there's no reason that you 
can't go, so I just stopped right 
then and I said okay you can go.  And 
so that's how I did it.  And I signed 
myself up to go.

else up. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Yeah, so anyway. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Many people, and I 
think you eluded to this, who were 
born or grew up in the North have 
shared that they went to the South 
with the intention of only staying 
for a short time and then ended up 
staying for a long time.  Did you  
01:23:39 
have a plan for how long you were 
making the trip?

volunteer for the summer.  I think 
back inside myself I knew that I was  
01:23:50 
going to want to be there more than 
one summer but that wasn’t up front 
in my mind.  I got there and I got 
involved in the work and I wanted to—
and I stayed beyond the summer.  
Because you know I had—we have 
cousins who lived in southern 
Maryland and we would go to visit our 
cousins.  And when I was a teenager 
we would go there and I would have a  
01:24:18 
great time when I was with my cousins 
in southern Maryland.  We would go to 
joints and we would dance and we 
would have a good time.  And so I 
found quite a lot of the same kind of 
the thing in the South.  You know in 
Arkansas after we worked ourselves to 
death then we would go this—it wasn't 
the Hall, the Hall was the place you 
know where my cousins lived.  But we  
01:24:46 
would go to this I think VFW hall and 
we would dance and we would have a 
nice time, we would enjoy.  But

that's not the reason I stayed, I got

01:25:02 
loved the work. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Can we talk a little 
bit—obviously your work started long 
before you went South.  I mean 
getting involved in Pennsylvania and 
then moving out west.  When you made 
it down south what were some of your 
first responsibilities, what did you 
get involved in? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  I was the Director of  
01:25:22 
the Freedom School in West Helena, 
Arkansas.  And it was truly the 
result of the fact that I had worked 
in summer camps for many years as a 
camper and as a director.  And so 
what I did in so many words was set 
up a day camp in West Helena, 
Arkansas for those children there and 
we did a lot of different kinds of 
activities.  And of course an  
01:25:52 
important part of that was discussing 
with them what was going on in their 
communities and facilitating for them

opportunities to express themselves 
and to write poetry if that was what  
01:26:05 
they desired and stuff like that.  
And so that was the first thing I 
did.  And the most important part of 
that summer for me was the guidance 
that I received from the workers who 
were there.  Because one of the 
things they said to me, and as a 
matter of fact Mike had said the same 
thing to me before I got in the 
South, that I needed to pay attention  
01:26:29 
to what was going on around me, that 
I didn’t need to get involved right 
away, you know thinking that I had 
something to offer or to lead or to 
guide.  That it was important for me 
to watch and listen and learn.  And 
as a matter of fact the director of 
the project in West Helena told me go 
to community meetings but do not get 
up and tell people what you think,  
01:26:56 
stay in your seat.  If you have to 
write down what you think and we can 
talk about it later.  And so that was

the most important experience for me 
that summer.  Of course I did voter  
01:27:09 
registration, there were nine of us 
volunteers that summer and there were 
two of us who were black.  And we did 
voter registration, we did—I did the 
Freedom School, we attended community 
meetings in different parts of the 
county.  And I learned how to go 
places and just be there and 
gradually get acquainted with people, 
people knew who I was and I would go  
01:27:46 
places and just kind of hang out.  
And you know gradually introduce 
myself to people and then my goal 
would be to get - - and then 
gradually ease in to some discussion 
with them to find out where they were 
in terms how they felt about being 
involved in the movement.  How they 
felt about coming to the meeting once 
a week and once they were at the  
01:28:12 
meeting would they do other things 
related to what we were doing.  Would 
they canvas, would they picket, what

in Mississippi?

or--? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Exactly.  Yeah, I 
worked at West Helena from—I worked 
in Arkansas from May of 1965 until—I 
don't remember exactly when in 1967.  
I had to come out because I was sick.   
01:28:51 
And I was in Atlanta where I saw the 
doctor and then I knew John 
Buffington from seeing him at 
meetings and John asked me if I would 
come and work at his project in West 
Point, Mississippi and I agreed to do 
that in 1967. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  What was his project in 
West Point? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  It was a regular  
01:29:16 
project, you know the same kinds of 
things.  You moved around and you got

them—you know if there were 
challenges that they were facing,  
01:29:30 
problems they were having you'd help 
them to think through things that 
they could do or you helped them to 
do things to help solve those 
problems.  And that was the tact we 
took in the meetings also.  People 
would talk about things that they 
wanted to see differently in their 
communities and we would try to help 
people to think of what are some  
01:29:53 
things that the community could do to 
make the changes, how should we 
proceed to make those changes.  And 
you would help people to go forward 
with their ideas and try as much as 
possible to not put your stuff on 
them, you know let stuff come from 
them.  And then support that.  Like 
for example in Jones Ridge, Arkansas 
the Turner Elementary School, the

families there were disturbed because 
every time it rained the toilets 
would back up and feces would float

down the hall in the elementary 
school.  And so that had been going  
01:30:45 
on for a long, long time.  And they 
had been complaining and trying to 
get somebody in the county to come 
and see about it but no one every 
came, and so when we started having 
the meeting in Jones Ridge that was 
one of the things that came up.  And 
so I wasn’t working that part of the 
county it was my co-worker Howard 
Himmelbaum who was doing the work.   
01:31:10 
And he said to people what do you 
want to do and so they said well we 
want to get this changed, so they 
thought about all the different 
things they could do and then they 
decided after they tried going back 
to the county and seeing about it 
again.  Then they decided they should 
go to Little Rock and go to the 
Health Department in Little Rock,  
01:31:30 
which is what they did.  And then 
people came down and checked things 
out and they found that the pipes had

been laid uphill and so anytime it 
rained there was a problem.  So once  
01:31:45 
that was corrected then the people in 
that community said well we did that, 
that was great, now we can think of 
other things we can do to make the 
schools better for our kids.  And so 
that was how we got started.  And 
actually that energy took us to where 
people decided that they wanted to do 
a school boycott and to force 
desegregation.  Because at that time  
01:32:11 
they thought that the way that their 
kids could get the best education was 
if all the children were educated 
together.  And so they decided to go 
for that.  And we spent a good part 
of the summer of 1966 moving around 
to different places in the county and 
having meetings and talking and 
building people's confidence up so 
that when school started that fall we  
01:32:42 
held 1500 of 1800 black kids out of 
the segregated school for six weeks.  
And then the school district did

capitulate and they desegregated the 
schools.  But you know I think—I  
01:33:01 
don’t think I said that in any of my 
little accounts.  But midway that 
process I began to have different 
thoughts, I began to feel like we 
don't need to be doing this because 
the hostility was so tremendous and 
there was great anger that during the 
boycott, I wasn’t there yet, but 
anyway I began feeling like we should 
not be getting in these white  
01:33:29 
schools, we should be trying to do 
our own school, make our own school 
what we needed it to be.  And I 
attempted to broach that with Mrs. 
Jackson, the woman who was the 
matriarch of the family that was 
central in all of these activities.  
And she just couldn’t see it all.  I 
mean she was just so caught—everybody 
was so caught up with we're going to

finally get our children together and 
what she said to me was when our

fine.  The children are not full of 
hate, the children will love each  
01:34:10 
other.  And so but what I was aware 
of was the fact that the anger and 
the hostility was so great that we 
just didn't need to be taking those 
chances, that was how I felt.  But we 
went ahead, we desegregated.  And I 
don’t think it was five years later 
when I went over to see Mrs. Jackson 
one time and she says Myrtle all of 
my kids hate white folks.  And so I  
01:34:40 
mean I knew that already.  And so she 
says well why is that, I said well 
you know they are being treated a 
certain way in the school.  And so 
you know once the kids got in the 
school, they had been in the band in 
our other school, they couldn't get 
in the band.  There were so many 
things that they were not allowed to 
do and people were condescending to  
01:35:05 
them.  And Mrs. Jackson was so 
unhappy and the kids themselves were 
very unhappy.

INTERVIEWER:  So that's how your 
thinking evolved, once you did come  
01:35:19 
down South and see the realities of 
certain situations— 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Yes. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  --and so the hostility 
and hatred was pretty visceral— 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Yes. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  --and part of the 
struggle.  You mentioned Mrs. 
Jackson, is this Gertrude Jackson? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Gertrude Jackson, yes. 
01:35:36 
INTERVIEWER:  Right.  So this was in 
the community of Marvell with Earlis 
and Gertrude Jackson? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Yes. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Can you talk a little 
bit more about your interactions with 
them?  About that project and working 
with the both of them and voter 
registration and the schools and 
public safety. 
01:35:54 
DR. GLASCOE:  Well the Jackson family 
was the—you know like you can say in 
most projects there's usually one

family that is kind of around which 
the project revolves.  And so the  
01:36:12 
Jackson family, Mrs. Jackson and her 
husband Gertrude and Earlis, as well 
as James Jackson, Mr. Jackson's 
brother.  As well as a Jackson who 
was a cousin who owned the store.  
All of those people were staunchly in 
support of change for their 
communities.  And Earlis Jackson and 
James Jackson farmed together, they 
planted cotton and I think they  
01:36:43 
planted soy beans.  And there was one 
instance where they were getting 
ready to harvest their cotton and 
sugar was put in the gas tank of 
their cotton picker.  They went out 
to crank it and they found that the 
sugar was in there and of course the 
engine was destroyed.  And Mr. 
Jackson, Mr. Earlis Jackson and Mr. 
James Jackson didn't get upset, they  
01:37:13 
just stopped and took the thing 
apart, cleaned it, put it back 
together and went back to work.  And

they just kept going like that.  I 
mean they were an inspiration to all  
01:37:23 
of us, they were so strong.  And Mr. 
Earlis Jackson and Mrs. Gertrude 
Jackson had 11 children and they were 
just practically fearless.  And Mrs. 
Jackson had this kind of soft spoken 
way and she was easy going and I mean 
as I've gotten to know her since 
then, in many ways that was just a 
façade because she is powerful.  And 
so what would happen was that one of  
01:37:57 
the things that I would do every week 
would be move around to different 
people in the community who were 
working with us and just go and visit 
and sit with them for a little bit to 
see what they were thinking about.  
And actually I used that as my 
preparation for the meeting that we 
would have later that week.  And so I 
would go and I would sit with each— 
01:38:18 
maybe four or five different people I 
would sit with and make sure I knew 
what was on their minds and say some

things to them that I thought they 
needed to hear.  And so I would go to  
01:38:27 
Mrs. Jackson and we would do that.  
And then what I began to realize 
after awhile, I didn't pick it up 
right away, was that when I would go 
to Mrs. Jackson, Mrs. Jackson would 
always have great ideas about things 
to do.  And so the way she would do 
it is she would tell me the idea and 
so I would be so excited about it I 
would just go to the meeting and when  
01:38:50 
the meeting was going on I would 
present the idea.  Then I finally—I 
backed up a little bit and I thought 
about it and I said to myself, Mrs. 
Jackson is planting stuff on me and 
she should be doing it herself.  And 
so when I finally got clear about 
that the next time I went to see Mrs. 
Jackson and she started her little 
process of putting these ideas on me.   
01:39:13 
I said Mrs. Jackson this is your 
idea, it's not my idea it's yours.  
And so this time when we go to the

meeting you're going to present that 
idea, I'm not going to present it.   
01:39:26 
And so she—you know she said no, I 
don't know how to present that idea, 
you are good at presenting the idea, 
you are the one that needs to do it.  
I said no Mrs. Jackson, you are the 
one who has the idea and your 
community needs to know that you are 
the one who has the ideas and you are 
the one who needs to stand on those 
ideas and help people to know how to  
01:39:51 
do them.  And so that first time I 
waited until she expressed her idea, 
it was kind of tense, but she did 
indeed say what she had on her mind.  
And then as time went on she would do 
that more and more.  But in the long 
run it was Mrs. Jackson who pulled 
people together and got them 
organized and they actually set up a 
community center and it still is in  
01:40:20 
existence.  It's limping, but it's 
still there.

assume, I'm trying to understand how 
this was all pulled together, that  
01:40:32 
volunteers who came from the North, 
there was always a movement afoot in 
the communities in the South.  So 
what did the volunteers bring?  I 
mean it looks like you were looking 
for it to be a mutual process, that 
you spent time observing and watching 
and didn't want to insert yourself 
and come in there and say that you 
think you should do this and that and  
01:40:57 
that.  That you were very careful in 
working with the communities and 
letting the ideas come from them.   
 
DR. GLASCOE:  My goal being there was 
to create a process where they got in 
touch with the fact that they are 
capable and where they develop 
confidence to move and do on their 
own.  And I saw that as the building 
blocks to them being in charge of  
01:41:26 
their own communities and doing 
things for themselves.  I have to say 
that where I was successful in that

regard with Mrs. Jackson, she was one 
of the few people who were willing to  
01:41:44 
pick up and assert herself.  There 
were people who wanted to be in 
charge and to do things but they 
didn't trust themselves.  And Mrs. 
Jackson got to where she did trust 
herself and so she was able to step 
forward and do things.  The 
experience I had— 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Some other community 
leaders it didn't work the same way. 
01:42:18 
DR. GLASCOE:  Well I mean—for 
example, now Mr. Jackson when I came 
to things that were related to what 
he had to do, you know once—like for 
example some people who get sugar in 
the gas tank of their—in the tank of 
their cotton picker would just be 
devastated.  But to Mr. Jackson and 
his brother it was sort of like this 
goes with the territory, now let's  
01:42:46 
just fix it and keep moving.  But he—
when every time I came back to visit 
Mr. Jackson would tell me stuff, okay

it would be like—they didn't call me 
Ms. Myrtle but Myrtle we still having  
01:43:01 
these problems and it was to sort of 
like telling me to help him to solve 
them.  And I would always be saying 
well Mr. Jackson, did you do this, 
did you do that, things that I used 
to say back when.  But you know where 
Mrs. Jackson—Mrs. Jackson figured out 
how to send all of her girls to 
college.  I mean she connected with a 
woman in Connecticut who was willing  
01:43:31 
to send her money so that those kids 
could go to college.  I mean I didn’t 
know a thing about how she did it, I 
didn't know when she did it or 
anything, she just did that.  You 
know, do you see a difference in the 
spirit.  And her husband never—I mean 
there were things that he was strong 
on but not by comparison to Mrs. 
Jackson.  She was creative, she is  
01:44:00 
creative, you know she was always 
looking for ways to do stuff that 
other people didn't think about.

INTERVIEWER:  During your time with 
SNCC the dynamics of group leadership  
01:44:14 
and participation really changed in 
relationship to the white workers, 
what did you witness in the 
communities in which you worked? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Well my co-worker 
Howard Himmelbaum was a Jewish guy 
and we worked fine, I mean I thought 
we worked fine, we did work fine 
actually we didn't have any conflicts 
of any sort.  But when we were  
01:44:40 
planning for things to do the two of 
us always talked and we always worked 
out whatever differences of opinion 
we might have before we went to do 
things, like I think I mentioned in 
one of my write-ups that we had this 
workshop for people, it was like a 
legal support workshop, where people 
who were trying to get on welfare and 
couldn't came and a lawyer would talk  
01:45:13 
to them.  Anyway I was saying that I 
said that.  But Howard attending the

decision was made that the white 
workers should leave the black  
01:45:27 
communities and go and work in white 
communities.  And when he came back 
he just matter of fact said to me, 
Myrtle I'm going to leave in X number 
of days.  What we decided at the 
meeting was this and so he told it to 
me and he did indeed leave.  And I 
was worried, I was scared at first 
but once he was gone I found that 
there was stuff inside me I didn't  
01:45:58 
even know I had.  And so when it came 
time to make decisions I was 
perfectly capable of to make them on 
my own.  I began coming up with ideas 
I didn't even know were there.  In 
the beginning I was feeling very good 
and very confident and so that 
doesn't speak to the question of him 
being a white person at all, it 
speaks to me.  My sense of what it  
01:46:22 
was was that I was deferring to him, 
I was in that traditional man-woman 
role, you know where the woman gives

I was doing that.  And so I  
01:46:37 
discovered some things about myself 
once he left.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  Do you have a sense 
what the larger discussion was?  
Because obviously it empowered you to 
feel that there was more that you 
could do and that you had the 
capability to be out there on your 
own but did you—it sounds like you 
were kind of working on your own  
01:47:00 
where other people were spread out 
all over the place.  Did you have a 
sense of what some of the larger 
questions that people were asking in 
regard to making that change about 
where white workers would work and 
where black workers would work? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Well I understood 
entirely that it was difficult for 
black people to get to where they  
01:47:23 
could feel comfortable doing things 
for themselves with a white person in 
a position of to their way of

thinking of authority.  Even though I 
did my best to say to people and to  
01:47:36 
behave to people, you are in charge 
of your community, I'm here to help 
you to think about what you want to 
do and to plan for things that you 
need to do and to do those things 
effectively.  It was fine for me to 
say that but it was quite a different 
thing for people to fully buy it and 
not see me as an authority figure.  
Because I came from somewhere, I was  
01:48:01 
a college graduate, I was actually a 
Master's degree person at that time 
and I had a level of expertise, I 
could talk well, I could write well.  
I knew I had a whole lot of knowledge 
that people didn't have so for them 
to rise up and also not think of me 
as someone in charge, that was a 
challenge.  And so if I had been 
white that's even more of challenge.

And I understood that, I saw that.  I 
didn't see it as clearly before

gone, I saw it, you know, and I saw 
how people had backed off and how  
01:48:46 
they weren't as comfortable to be 
themselves around him.  And so of 
course—I mean my position was not to 
rub that in his face because he had 
done many things in that community 
that helped that community and I 
respected that and I respected him.  
And as a matter of fact I like him, 
I'm still in touch with him.  In many 
ways, you know, we lived in the same  
01:49:12 
house, he was like a brother to me 
and so it's complex. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Mm-hmm. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  It's not anything, it's 
not open and shut.  But the part that 
could be open and shut is for white 
people to get to where they become 
aware of who they are and how they 
impact other people, other black 
people.  And for Howard, Howard was  
01:49:44 
willing to pull himself back and do 
some reflecting to see how that was.

worker until—from May of 1965 until 
the fall of 1967.  By this time I'm 
in Mississippi and I'm flat out 
broke.  And there was an opportunity 
for a job in the Head Start Program

Washington.  And between 1985 and 
1993 you were the Founding Director 
of Charleston's Avery Research 
Center.  How do you consider these 
activities to be part of your ongoing 
contribution to the Freedom Movement? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Well first of all I 
became an activist.  When you become 
an activist you don't give up being 
an activist, it gets inside you.  And  
01:51:35 
so you know I approached things—I 
guess I was an activist when I was a 
kid because I went straight at stuff 
and I had to learn how to go at stuff 
and not go so dead straight.  Because 
lots of times when you go straight at 
stuff you turn people off and they 
are people that you need to be 
connected to.  What did I do first—
after I left—after I worked—the first  
01:52:09 
thing I did that was not—well, I 
taught at Tougaloo College right 
after I worked in the movement.  And

worked in the Head Start Program and  
01:52:27 
I don't know if anyone has said this 
to you or not, you know in an 
interview or not, but the Head Start 
Program in Mississippi which was 
started in 1965 was the first Head 
Start Program in the country.  And 
the way it got started was that the 
volunteers, the white volunteers, who 
had worked in Mississippi came back 
home all caught up with their  
01:52:55 
feelings about how people were so 
poor and people did not have decent 
schools and people did not have 
enough food to eat, they got involved 
in trying to set up some kind of 
program to meets those needs.  And 
what they came up with was the Head 
Start Program.  And so on the one 
hand in the sense that it—in one 
sense it was an excellent situation  
01:53:23 
because for the first time people who 
had been working the cotton fields 
and making stuff like $10 and $12 a

shouldn’t say $10 or $12 a day, $5 a  
01:53:39 
day.  You know you pick a certain 
number of pounds you get $5 for that 
and you work 12 hours to do that.  So 
those people had jobs where they were 
making $65 a week.  And it was the 
first time black folk had jobs that 
were not connected to the white power 
structure in Mississippi.  At the 
same time by placing the program on 
the wheels and the infrastructure of  
01:54:10 
the movement, it gradually destructed 
that infrastructure.  What I'm 
talking about is how people got 
together to create programs for their 
children before Head Start and to 
work out ways to feed their children 
before Head Start on their own, out 
of their own funds.  When the money 
came then there got to be concerns 
about well who makes the decision  
01:54:49 
about who gets the jobs and how do 
people get to have these jobs.  And 
so what you had was people who had

movement being separated because so

and so was on the Board and he made 
sure all his family got the jobs.  
And Ms. Johnson over here who had 
also worked closely with him in the 
movement days was not on the Board 
and so she didn't get to have any say 
about who got the jobs.  And 
furthermore she might not have gotten 
one herself.  And so that just 
dropped all kinds of poison down into  
01:55:37 
the infrastructure of the movement.  
And so after awhile people who had 
been close, who had worked hard 
together, who had just struggled 
together weren't speaking to each 
other.  It was very painful to watch, 
very painful.  I worked for that 
program, I was the Director of the 
community program organizers.  You

whatever period we had the funding 
for and the program was going along  
01:56:25 
and people who—everybody who worked 
in the program had formally been 
working in the movement.  And so 
people continued to do the things 
they had done in the movement, to 
make sure folks got information, to 
make sure folks stayed abreast of 
certain issues, to make sure folks 
got out to vote and stuff like that.  
And so of course Stennis fought it,  
01:56:46 
this is a federal program supposed to 
be for education and food and 
changing communities, it's not 
supposed to be the movement.  So he 
would bring the program to a dead 
stop and so people would not have 
jobs for X amount of months.  And 
then there'd be a big fight in 
Washington and then the program would 
come back.  And then there'd have to  
01:57:12 
be a decision about well who's going 
to get the jobs this time, who's 
going to be on the Board, because

job.  And of course it didn't have 
nothing to with—I mean I had the job 
because I had the job.  But their 
jobs had been cut off because the 
program was stopped.  So even during 
the time when the program had stopped 
there were certain people who kept on

working, I'm one of those.  I got to

quitting.  And so I just waited, I 
just stopped working until the  
01:58:15 
program came back and then I went 
back to work.  Because it was too 
painful, you know it was just too 
painful because folks were angry at

all that.  It was just very, very

Tougaloo from 1969 to 1972 and I 
taught in the sociology department, I 
taught for Dr. Ernst Borinski.  And 
because of who I was to a large 
extent, I just continued doing what 
I'd always been doing.  Bringing 
information to people, helping the  
01:59:11 
kids to understand certain kinds of 
things, you know.  At the time I 
became a Muslim, I was in the Nation

and I was passing that information 
onto people, how to eat to live, and  
01:59:24 
so the kids would be walking around 
campus saying did you hear what 
Glascoe said last week, she said 
you're supposed to eat this and 
you're not supposed to eat that.  But 
I enjoyed that tremendously.  And I 
also—I developed a course that was 
called The Small Group in Process 
where we focused on getting to know 
ourselves as individuals and also as  
01:59:50 
people who are part of communities.  
And I've had young people to say to 
me that that course caused them to 
think about themselves in ways that 
they had never realized that they 
needed to and it helped to change 
their lives.  And to some extent I 
still have versions of that course 
salted into everything I do, you know 
that is like in my teaching.

kind of mimics your own evolution in 
your own life, kind of being a part

of community and getting involved?  
Did your own experiences kind of feed  
02:00:30 
into developing that course? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  I'm sure.  I'm sure of 
that but it's actually focused on—see 
the challenge for me has been getting 
to know myself, getting to know who I 
am, getting to know what my gifts 
are, what my liabilities could be, 
what areas of my personality need me 
to be aware of them and be on top of 
them all the time.  And that was the  
02:01:04 
gift that I attempted to give to my 
students through that course.  That 
it's very important for you to know 
how you affect others.  When you go 
into a situation what's your 
personality like?  Are you open and 
outgoing, are you shy and retiring, 
do you just kind of take things as 
you go along and in any of those 
cases how would that affect other  
02:01:28 
people who are just meeting you.  So

way I would approach that whole set 
of issues was well each one of you  
02:01:43 
has a story and each one of you needs 
to tell your story to yourself first.  
And then you need to tell your story 
to the class so that each one of us 
can get to know each other.  And in 
that process I actually set up a 
format for people to follow, to do 
that and so it was—what I would ask 
them is what are you bringing in your 
suitcase with you of your beliefs and  
02:02:14 
your attitudes into classrooms where 
children are.  Do you know what you 
have in your suitcase?  If you look 
in your suitcase that you're bringing 
with you and you see some things that 
you'd rather not the children have, 
do you know how to take those things 
out of your suitcase, do you know how 
to adjust those things, so that you 
don't bring that in its form that  
02:02:36 
it's in now to the classroom.  Can 
you see how that would affect the 
young people in the classroom?  Those

up front and to be straight ahead.   
01:02:12 
And I had to learn at the Avery 
Project that that wasn’t going to 
work.  That to be upfront and 
straight ahead with people who were 
waiting for you to give over to them 
was not going to work.  But at the 
same time they were kind of in a 
tight position. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Can you tell us a 
little bit about the Avery Project,  
01:02:36 
just for the record. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Okay.  I was invited in 
1985 to be the Founding Director of 
the Avery Research Center for African 
American History and Culture.  It was 
envisioned as in archives by a group 
of people who had attended the Avery 
School—like the Avery School was 
founded in 1865 and it was the first 
academic high school for black people  
01:03:10 
in Charleston, South Carolina.  And 
it remained open as an academic high 
school for black people until 1954.

And by that time, by 1954, the city 
of Charleston had a school that had  
01:03:31 
combined academic and vocational 
pursuits.  And right now the name of 
that school doesn't come to me.  So 
the Avery School was closed in 1954 
and the building that had been built 
for it—I need to go back and say 
this, during the years that the Avery 
School was open it was supported by 
the American Missionary Association 
and there's a connection between the  
01:04:10 
American Missionary Association and 
the Amistad and I can't speak about 
it directly right now, but anyway, so 
there's a lot of history in there.  
And so anyway people who had—it was a 
school that had a reputation of being 
discriminatory inside the black 
community.  There were comments made 
that black skinned people did not go 
to the Avery.  If you got there and  
01:04:43 
you were black skinned you were there 
but the Avery did not welcome black 
skinned people, they welcomed light

skinned black people to the Avery.  
And so that was one of the  
01:04:54 
reputations of the Avery.  But the 
story, the long and the short of it 
is, graduates of that school after 
the school was closed and it went 
through a number of different 
incarnations with different 
organizations living in that 
building, those graduates got 
together and they wanted to get the 
building back and put back into it an  
01:05:20 
institution that would support the 
education of black people in 
Charleston.  And so I was invited 
down to head that up.  When I got 
there the organization it called 
itself the Avery Institute for 
African American History and Culture.  
I think they called themselves the 
Avery Institute of African American 
History and Culture.  They had  
01:05:48

received a planning grant.  And so

there was a plan in place and my job 
was to bring that plan into fruition.   
01:06:07 
And I went to work on that.  When I 
came the building was not in any way 
useable, it was sitting there and it 
was deteriorating.  And so boy oh 
boy, go back and try to recap all 
that. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  You don’t have to recap 
everything. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  But what was clear to 
me when I first came was that because  
01:06:38 
the building—because literally I was 
given an office that was about twice 
the size of this room and I was told 
to work in that office.  And of 
course that first year I had enough 
money to get me through the budget 
year, I actually had some money left 
over at the end of the year.  So the 
first thing I started thinking about 
was how was I going to spend that  
01:07:03 
money, how was I going to make it 
worth the while of it being there.  
And so I purchased collections from a

Guy and Candy Carawan of the music of 
John's Island.  I purchased that  
01:07:19 
collection and also the art, the 
photographs.  I can't remember—you 
know all this. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Mm-hmm. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  So that was my first 
purchase.  And so I found out that 
was—actually Guy and Candy came by to 
say hello and we got into this 
conversation and they started telling 
me about how the people on John's  
01:07:42 
Island really did want those 
materials to be available to them.  
And so he talked about it as if, if I 
could I would make this available. 
And so I said well Guy, I think I 
have enough money in my budget that I 
could possibly work on bring those 
materials here and so I did.  And so 
I let him know shortly and then we 
got this process going where we  
01:08:10 
purchased the collection, I don't 
remember what we paid for it, we 
purchased the collection.  We

purchased the photographs, was the 
guys name Yellin [phonetic], I don’t  
01:08:18 
remember what his name is.  We 
purchased the photographs from him 
and we purchased the music, I don’t 
know who owned the music, anyway we 
got it.  So I got that and I bought 
some furniture for my office.  That 
was the way I used that budget money.  
And I got busy thinking about what 
kind of ways could we do other things 
to let people know that we were there  
01:08:46 
and that we were alive.  And so the 
first thing I did was to plan a 
conference on the work of black women 
in South Carolina.  I think prior to 
that—no I think I did that right in 
the beginning.  So at the end of the 
budget year I found out that the folk 
in South Carolina who make decisions 
about who's going to get money and 
who's not going to get money had   
01:09:10 
made a decision, and since we didn't 
have any operation there was no 
reason for us to have any money.  And

so they said that to me and so I 
started telling them all the things  
01:09:23 
that we had done and all the things I 
had intended to do so they gave me a 
budget for the next year.  And it 
went like that for the next couple of 
years.  And then with me planning—you 
know the program that Elaine talked 
about on the study of African 
American funerals and mourning 
customs we also did that project and 
Elaine worked with us in that  
01:09:51 
project.  And we did all kinds of 
stuff until we had a building where 
we could do stuff in.  And then of 
course as I was going along we 
started working to do the building, 
we had to come up with a plan for how 
we were going to do it, where we were 
going to get the money from and there 
was black person in the legislature, 
a black Charlestonian who was in the  
01:10:21 
legislature and he was instrumental 
in helping us to come up with a plan 
for how we could do that.  And the

other thing that I didn't mention was 
prior to my coming the organization  
01:10:37 
of graduates had lobbied the state 
legislature and gotten a commitment 
from them to support the development 
of the Avery Research Center.  All of 
it is about how I was able to figure 
out ways to keep it alive until we 
actually got into the building, got 
the building going and of course part 
of doing that was the building had to 
be fully renovated.  And of course  
01:11:06 
the college was doing that.  What 
else do you want to know about that?  
I could talk about that for the rest 
of the afternoon.

see you were there— 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  [interposing] Do I see 
it as part of my activism? 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Yes.  And in what way?

Or when looking back on it now. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  I mean bottom line on 
that is that—I may be mistaken but

the average person who would come 
somewhere to work would expect people  
01:11:40 
to tell her what to do and to say 
well you can use these funds to do 
this, you can use these funds to do 
that.  My position was the funds are 
there, I'm in charge of them, I'm 
going to figure out what to do with 
the money.  I'm not going to ask 
nobody what I should do with this 
money, I'm going to figure out—then I 
began to realize that my boss who was  
01:12:08 
the Director of Libraries at the 
college had said to me I don't want 
any surprises.  So I took a position 
that anything I was getting ready to 
do I would tell him.  And I literally 
would tell him, I would say David 
what I'm thinking about is this, and 
I would lay it out what I was 
thinking about, whatever it was, and 
instead of him saying I don't think  
01:12:36 
you should do that he would say well 
I don't know if that's a good idea.  
If he did not tell me no, I was gone.

That's the activism.  If he did not 
say no, I mean I just went ahead and  
01:12:52 
did it.  Which means that every 
budget I had I spent all of the money 
when I was supposed to spend it.  I 
bought books, I bought tapes, I 
bought equipment, I have a copy of Du 
Bois' papers there, I did a whole 
bunch of stuff.  And so you know it 
was about we're going to keep this 
thing going, we're going to make it 
work, we're going to bring it to  
01:13:15 
life, it's going to have a life—I 
mean literally and of course that's 
where I ran into trouble with the 
school, it's going to have a life of 
its own.  Because my position is when 
you put something into action it does 
create a life of its own and your job 
is to see what that is and then to 
implement it.  But the college didn't 
want that, the college wanted to put  
01:13:41 
the Avery together, they wanted it to 
sit over there so they could say, oh 
you see this lovely place that we

wonderful.  It is wonderful but it  
01:13:53 
has a life of its own, if you're not 
going to honor the fact that it has a 
life of its own, I had to leave.  I 
literally had to leave because I got 
to a point where it was clear to me 
that the college wanted me to sit 
there and move papers.  Mm-mm.  
Because I was interested in an oral 
history project, I was interested in 
having the freedom to see what needed  
01:14:20 
to be done and getting out there and 
doing it.  You know this is an 
institution that is here for black 
people and it goes out to find the 
black people and to do the work that 
the black people need to have done.  
You don't bring me in here and set me 
up in this place and then tell me I 
have to have this hat on my head 
that's going to keep me from seeing  
01:14:40 
stuff.  Nope you don't do that to me, 
not me.  And then of course I went

School of Education.  And they gave 
me a syllabus to teach the  
01:14:54 
introductory course in education to 
people who were going to be teachers.  
And the first thing I noticed was 
they had nothing in there about 
anything except white people.  So by 
this time, you know in education 
circles we were talking about 
multicultural, so the first thing I 
do in that course is to introduce 
native people, African people, Asian  
01:15:27 
people, all of the different 
permutations of that.  And I don't 
ask them can I do this in my course.  
In so many words when people would 
ask me I'd say I don't know how to 
teach the course unless I teach this, 
do you see who I am. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  We didn't get to talk a 
little bit about your work with 
W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T.  
01:15:53 
Washington in your research.  And I 
was wondering if you brought any 
insight to that given your

involvement in the Freedom Movement 
when you started to work on these  
01:16:03 
topics or teach and write about them.  
Were there any kind of new insights 
that you had bringing their words and 
writings of a previous era? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Well the bottom line on 
all of that is I've done one 
published article.  Actually I've 
done about three published articles 
about my work on Du Bois.  I did my 
work on Du Bois educational thought  
01:16:29 
and how it evolved and how it changed 
over the years.  And I'm getting 
ready now to go back and publish that 
material, I'm getting ready to get 
into that dissertation and pull it up 
and bring all of what I have now to 
it.  And I mean it's interesting 
because I was invited to give a paper 
at Greeley, Colorado on Du Bois' role 
in founding the NAACP and in that  
01:17:05 
context I wove the ideas on education 
onto all that.  And so what I 
realized then was I'm much better

prepared now to approach that work 
from the perspective of what I can  
01:17:18 
bring as a result of all my different 
experiences.  What I can bring to—
what insights I might be able to 
bring to his thoughts.  And I haven't 
given as much time as maybe I will 
give to Booker T. Washington.  But 
one of the things that I'm clear 
about is that the whole two-ness 
idea.  Where I take it is that the 
two-ness idea reflects on the  
01:17:47 
one hand—what I believe Du Bois was 
saying was that on one hand we are 
African and on the other had we are 
American.  And where I take that in 
terms of education is that as 
teachers we must be aware of the fact 
that African American children must 
have opportunities to reflect the 
culture that they come out of and at 
the same time they must prepare to  
01:18:19 
live in this society, even though 
their lives in the society will 
contradict many of the values that

they bring with them from their 
culture.  And that for me is a level  
01:18:31 
of the complexity and the intricacy 
of those ideas and that in terms of 
the two-ness.  And so I'm trying to 
think if I can just bring anything 
else right off the top of my head in 
relationship to all of this.  I don't 
know that I can.  And I see myself 
connecting to Du Bois' ideas about 
what we'll call the Talented Tenth.  
You know that in the beginning he  
01:19:08 
envisioned the Talented Tenth in 
terms of what they were bringing as 
well as who they were in terms of the 
class base for it.  And you also know 
that later in the 1930's he got to 
the point where he began to say, well 
the way I approached it in the 
beginning doesn't work.  And what I 
want are the most talented and the 
most gifted of our young people to  
01:19:37 
come forward and be ready to serve.  
And the way to get them is not to go 
about it in the way that I was going

there's so many things that are going

on that are about those of us who 
have must turn around and give.  
That's what I see.  And I will have

INTERVIEWER:  In your perspective are 
there lessons to be learned or to be 
passed on based on your involvement 
in the Freedom Movement to young  
01:20:14 
people to today?  Are there some 
things that worked then that won't 
work now, are there some lessons to 
remember from then that we need to—
people need to implement now?  What 
would you say in that regard given 
the current climate of things? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  What I would say is 
that our struggle is to fully prepare 
our young people to know on the one  
01:20:44 
hand who they are as individuals and 
as members of a particular community 
and at the same time enable them to

see clearly what the society is 
about.  To see the contradictions  
01:21:01 
between who they are as members of a 
particular community, the 
contradictions between that and what 
the society says it is and what the 
society purports to offer.  And to

reality that we face.  That's what I 
would say.

01:22:24 
DR. GLASCOE:  Anyway, we're in such a 
dilemma in so many words, our 
children are lost, so so-called 
desegregated education is not serving 
us, it does not prepare our young 
people for the lives that they need 
to lead in this society.  And 
furthermore there's no place, except 
that we do it ourselves, where our 
children can know and understand  
01:23:02 
what's going on in this society.  How 
the oppression is still here, it's 
alive and well and it surrounds us

it, accept it and work out ways that 
we're going to have decent lives in 
spite of it.  And what that means is 
on the one hand we're going to know  
01:23:43 
who we are, we're going to know what 
we can do, we're going to have skills 
to do it, at the same time we're 
going to know about this thing that 
calls itself a society.  And what it 
is and how it functions and how we 
fit into or don’t fit into it so that 
we can manage our lives in it, 
because we ain't got no place to go.  
You know one of the most exciting

things I've heard lately is how the

INTERVIEWER 2:  Myrtle. 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Yes. 
 
INTERVIEWER 2:  You started talking 
about the education system and how  
01:24:45 
you feel like it has failed provide 
the kind of education that African 
American children need, can you say 
some more about it? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Well first of all the 
teachers do not believe our children 
are capable of learning.  Not only is 
that the case for European American 
teachers, it is the case for black 
American teachers who have been  
01:25:15 
educated in this system, who have 
been taught how to teach by people 
who accept the idea of the innate

inferiority of people of color.  So 
when we have teachers who are with  
01:25:33 
our children having those attitudes, 
there is no expectation that the 
children will learn, will have the 
capacity to learn.  And so the 
experiences that the children need 
are not offered to them.  And many 
times the teachers don't even know 
that they have these attitudes 
themselves which is the reason why 
when I'm working with people who are  
01:25:56 
going to be teachers I ask them what 
are you bringing with you, what are 
your attitudes, what are your 
beliefs, what did you bring from your 
house, what did you bring from your 
upbringing.  How do you know how 
you're going to approach these young 
people?  And so many teachers tell me 
so many young people that are taught, 
and especially at Gettysburg College,  
01:26:19 
believe that their job was to keep 
the children quiet while they gave 
lectures to the children.  While they

tell the children what they're 
supposed to know.  They had no sense  
01:26:29 
of the fact that the children are 
human beings and that they have inner 
selves that need to be awakened and 
part of education is about that.  
They didn't even know that about 
themselves.  When I would ask them—
you know when I would be teaching and 
I would say to you well you have this 
assignment and your assignment is to 
read X and X and X and come back  
01:26:56 
prepared to discuss.  So the students 
would come back, well what are you 
going to give on the test.  I would 
say to them, I said well you read—I 
said now that is my question for the 
test, you have read such and such and 
such and such and such.  And you have 
also learned that such and such and 
such and such is going on in schools.  
So how do you take those ideas that  
01:27:19 
you learned when you read and apply 
them to what's going on in the 
schools.  In what ways would you

change the kinds of things that are

the students don't want to do that 
because it makes them think.  They 
want to do that, they don't want to 
think.  They want to have the answer—
they want me to ask them questions 
that's going to give them an 
opportunity to give the answer that 
they read in the book.  Mm-mm, that's 
not me.  You have to think.  In order 
for you to teach my child you have to  
01:27:52 
be thinking because my child has to 
learn how to think, if you don't 
believe in yourself and you're not 
able to think, how you going to teach 
my child?  You can't.  And I'm not 
talking about just black children, 
I'm talking about all children, all 
of us, all of us.  And in this 
society poor white children are in as 
much trouble as black children are  
01:28:15 
and other children of color.  Anyway, 
those are my thoughts.  Did that 
answer your question?

question?

INTERVIEWER 3:  I was wondering when 
you were thinking about going down 
South— 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  Yes. 
 
INTERVIEWER 3:  --that first time.  
Did people try to talk you out of it? 
 
DR. GLASCOE:  I didn't tell anybody,  
01:28:50 
I just went ahead and did it.  But of 
course my mother came down to visit.  
And when my mother got there she was—
I mean I met a new mother.  She 
behaved like she was an activist.  
And she was going around talking 
about what her group—and her group 
was doing things.  She was a nurse 
and her group of nurses had decided 
that they were going to find clothes  
01:29:13 
and package them and send them down 
to us, which was fine.  And so she 
went around telling everybody and

everybody was talking about oh the 
daughter's just like the mother.  And  
01:29:25 
then when I got home my mother looked 
at me, I hadn't been in the house 
five minutes, she says you will never 
get a husband down there.  And I 
didn't have enough sense to say to my 
mother, well mama I didn't go there 
to get a husband, I went there to do 
some other things.  No one actively 
tried to deter me.  As a matter of 
fact as I remember some people  
01:29:49 
thought I was courageous.  Are you 
going to do that, yes I am, and they 
thought that was courageous.  But I 
wasn't at home, I was in California, 
my family was back in D.C.  But my 
family wasn't happy with me being 
there.  My Godmother was—she 
understood what I was about, she was 
good with it.  But my mother was—as I 
know now, my mother was terrified.   
01:30:19 
She was afraid for me and she was 
worried about me and she wanted me to 
be on the path that she thought I
