This Island on which I Love You 
 
And when, on this island on which 
I love you, there is only so much land 
to drive on, a few hours to encircle 
in entirety, and the best of our lands 
are touristed, the beaches foam-laced 
with rainbowing suntan oil, 
the mountains tattooed with asphalt,  
pocked by telescoped domes, 
hotels and luxury condos blighting 
the line between ocean and sky, 
 
I find you between the lines 
of such hard edges, sitting on  
the kamyo stool, a bowl of coconut,  
freshly grated, at your feet.  
 
That I hear the covert jackaling  
of helicopters and jets overhead  
all night through our open jalousies,  
that my throat burns from the scorch 
of the grenaded graves of my ancestors,  
the vog that smears the Koʻolaus into a blur 
of greens, that I wake to hear the grind  
of you blending vegetables and fruit,  
machine whirl-crunching coffee beans,  
your shoulder blades channelling  
ocean, a steady flux of current.  
 
Past the guarded military testing grounds, 
amphibious assault vehicles emerging 
from the waves, beyond the tangles 
of tarp cities lining the roads, past  
the thick memory of molasses coating 
the most intimate coral crevices,  
by the box jellyfish congregating under  
ʻOle Pau and Kāloa moons, at the park 
beneath the emptied trees, I come  
to find you shaking five-dollar coconuts  
(because this is all we have on this island),  
listening to the water to guess  
its sweetness and youth. 
 
On this island on which I love you, 
something of you is in the rain rippling  
through the wind that make the pipes 
of Waikīkī burst open, long brown  
fingers of sewage stretch out  
from the canal, and pesticided 
tendrils flow from every ridge 
out to sea, and so we stay inside 
to bicker over how a plumeria tree 
moves in the wind, let our daughters 
ink lines like coarse rootlets  
in our notebooks, crayon lines  
into ladders on our walls  
and sheets. Their first sentences 
are sung, moonlit blowhole plumes 
of sound calling pebbles to couple, 
caverns to be carved, ʻuala to roll 
down the hillside again, and I could  
choke on this gratitude for you all. 
 
This island is alive with love, 
its storms, the cough of alchemy 
expelling every parasitic thing, 
teaching me to love you with  
the intricacies of island knowing,  
to depend on the archipelagic  
spelling of you lying next to me,  
our blue-screen flares their own 
floating islands after our daughters  
have finally fallen asleep, 
to trust in the shape and curve 
of your hand reaching out to hold mine 
making and remaking an island our own.
