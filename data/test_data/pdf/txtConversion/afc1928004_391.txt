GET THEE GONE, JANE. 
tornpoed anti 1,iung by Andy Colluni, 
As I 
was reading the bulletin last night. 
A very strange item on it caught my sight. 
About a 
red headed damsel who demoralized a 
clerk, 
Around the block she would hang when he was at work, 
She always would watch, on hint have an eye, 
And she vowed she would fix him, and have him or (lie. 
When she went to embrace hint he wonld bawl out so strong. 
Get thee gone, Jane, get thee gone, Jane, but Jane would not 
“et thee crone. 
She arose very early down town she would go. 
In search of her darling and that you must know. 
She would roost on the corner in his window she'd look. 
And see her own baby perusing his books, 
And when he'd go home from his work every night. 
She would seize his coat tail and there have a 
tight, 
Oh, site would cry, oh, dear George, and to her he would say. 
Get away, Jane, get away, Jane, but Jane wouldn't get away. 
Ile is worried to death and looks like a 
rail. 
By this damsel who sticks so close to his coat tail. 
She hollers out murder, in the streets site 1N- ill cry. 
When he hits her a. smash right over the eye, 
She bawls out police, and away he does tly. 
Leaving her nibs with a 
pair of black eyes, 
'Pile gang on the corner they will all give a 
cough, 
Get thee oft; Jane, get thee oft; Jane. but Jane don't get Tlice otI.

And with it Fll relate, 
About some funny sights 1

In a

There was turkey gobblers,

Get along children don't walk so slow,

For to-morrow am the holiday. 
Funniest sight 1 
ever saw, 
Was a 
rooster on a 
rail. 
Taking his ease a 
sunning himself, 
And shaking out his tail, 
That was on the other side of the fence to me, 
The reason he lost sight of his tail, 
,He was blind and could not see. 
CHORUS. 
As I 
was coming down Broadway to- day, 
The hoot-blacks on the corner at leisure did play, 
They all looked up and saw me by chance, 
Cried one stag the gauk he's got fringe on his pants, 
I 
took my girl to the ball last night. 
The gang on the floor commenced for to fight, 
My daisy got drunk and they slugged her by chance, 
For mashing a 
sue who had tar on his pants. 
Now all you young blokes take a 
warning from me, 
Oh, never get married how sorry 
be, 
You'll go to the parks and you will meet them by chance, 
But beware ()film daisy who wears fringe on her over- ails.

BROWN BAKED BEANS.

Chap who in Boston does dwell, 
Who lived beyond his means. 
At dinner he would call for lard on toast, 
And a 
plate of brown baked beans. 
He never refused to take a 
drink, 
But would ask his friends it seems, 
if they could lend him fifteen cents. 
To go and get his beans. 
At 12 A. 31. this aristocratic bum, 
On North street could be seen. 
'Working the lunch route every day. 
And going fur his beans. 
He W1h collared one day while at work. 
At the lunch where he was geell, 
AVith a

He hired as a

dining saloon. 
Every day where he was seen, 
Bawling out at the top of his voice. 
Eor another plate of beans. 
He was thinking of beans when he went to sleep, 
All at once he started in his dreams, 
In the middle of the bed he stood on his head. 
Crying another plate of leans.

Old uncle Pete had a 
dream last night, 
Looking out the window he saw a 
sight, 
MI about a 
story I 
am going to tell, 
Will make you all feel .. 4) well. 
Chicken in the hen- roost dancing juber, 
Monkey in the garden playing base, 
Ducks and the gander and old grey nag, 
Singing in the chorus rally round the flag. 
Owls in the tree winking, blinking, 
Cats in the pantry chasing mice, 
Bugs in the attic playing poker, 
Spider in the cobweb slinking dice. 
Chicken in the henroost drinking egg nog, 
Pig double shuffle in the sty, 
Massa swearing at the skeeters. 
Bald headed spiders coaxing 
Behind the hen- house on my knees, 
1 
thought I heard a 
rooster sneeze, 
Sneezed so hard with the hooping cough, 
Sneezed his head and tail both off.

Come gather you snoozers to you I 
will tell, 
Of a 
lunch route I've found out that will make your head swell. 
Three kinds of soup, there you can get every day, 
Noodle boodle, dumbee doodle, kindle they say, 
It is one, two and three, four, they will stand in a 
line, 
Getting away with lunch, for they never lose time. 
More bread, more bread, one bum you'll hear cry, 
When the bar tender hits him a 
smash in the eye. 
To-morrow they change for a 
better lunch route, 
Get mustard and cehese and dutch sour-krout, 
Red herring, and bologna, and meat so they say, 
Pluck liver and hats boys, (lout give it away, 
It's one, two and three, glass of beer at a 
time, 
They swell his nobs head, till he nearly looks blind, 
More beer, more beer, the bums they will roar. 
When the dutchman he tires them right out the front door.

KICK ME AGAIN. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Parody on Kiss Me Again. 
Sung by Andy Collum, 
I 
sat down one night on an old cellar door, 
Around the corner in front of a 
Dutch grocery store, 
Thinking of home, and my clothes all in hock, 
-When suddenly I 
experienced a 
terrible shock, 
The door gave away and unlucky I 
fell, 
I 
-bursted my pantaloons and undergarments as well, 
I 
struck on my head on the hard cellar floor, 
And the proprietor bounced me up through the door. 
Clionus, 
lie kicked me again in the bosom of my pants, 
Which made my stonetch feel queer, 
He kicked me again and because I 
complained, 
Out on the sidewalk I 
walked on my ear. 
Kicks are a 
thing that all bummers can get, 
If they bang around saloons and cigar stores you bet, 
They are always given freely and don't cost a 
cent, 
And the place that you get them are sure to be bent, 
If once you get landed out into the street, 
You hardly would care the dose to repeat, 
Boot toes have nails in and makes you feel sore, 
And always are ready to kick you once more. 
CHORUS. 
He kicked me again, So. 
a 
Sung by Andy Collum, 
Your attention now I 
ask, to what I'm going to say, 
The subject I'm about to hit, are the by- words of the day, 
In passing by the corners, now the first thing that your heat, 
Go give his nobs the buzz, cull, for two schooners of beer. 
'me gang goes around the corner, in the middle of the block, 
They give poor dutchey the finger, for beer and ginger pop, 
lie smiles and takes it very cool, until they try once more, 
Then he gets mad and says, he's glad if they don't come there 
any more, • 
They give the poor dutchman a 
great chin before he's got tune to 
think, 
They swell his head like a 
barrel, for four or five rounds ofdrink, 
Just then another one of the gang, says dutchey aint it warm. 
How is the beer, go find out he says, don't give me the racket so 
strong. 
Pipe the gin be tumbled, I 
wonder what he thinks, 
Go give him a 
little more taffy, for another round of drinks, 
You sherry his nibs, and cully too much, is all what I 
do hear. 
My lunch you have faked, my head you have swelled, but you 
don't get any more beer.

...JARODY ON GRANDFATHER'S CLOCK. 
Composed and sung with great success by Andy Conum. 
My grandfather's nose was as red as a 
beet, 
And he used to hang around in the yard, 
Get chuck 11 of gin around to Patsey Flynn's, 
With the gang he was always playing cards, 
They stuck him every game and they called for the same, 
So the old guy got chuck full of booze, 
They would lay him on the chairs, stick feathers in his ears, 
While the old bum ‘‘.:as taking a 
snooze. 
CHORUS. 
Thirty years he's been living on gin, gin, gin, gin, 
The neighbors around the corner say it's a 
d—sin,sin,sin,sin, 
But he stopped, quick, never to get drunk again, 
When his mother-in-law fired him out the door. 
My grandfather's watch was too large for his pockets, 
So he used to hang it up on the wall, 
Whenever he got broke of course he would go, 
And give Uncle Simpson a 
call, 
He would ask five or ten, or whetever they would lend, 
To the rum shop he would steer right away, 
Get full as a 
brick, next morning he was sick, 
While the super in the pawn shop it did lay, 
CH 
OTIX'z. 
Thirty days he's been lunching around on beans, bean, 
beans, beans, 
The bartender hit him with a 
screen, screen, screen, screen, 
Rut he dropped, quick, never to lunch again, 
When the bur teuder stood him on his ear. 
MAW 
IT MILD. 
Written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Let's learn to temper our wishes, 
For there's many a 
thing we desire, 
Which on the morrow is worthless, 
And makes nature a 
vivid satire. 
Young men whose fathers are wealthy, 
In dissipation their hours do beguile; 
Get all you can from the old man, 
But remember draw it mild. 
CHORUS. 
For those who wish to be much in life, 
My advice, to mail, woman or child, 
Is, go it strong while you are young, 
But rememler, draw it mild. 
To the blushing maid of sweet sixteen. 
At whom Cupid flings his dart, 
Love at first sight's not always right, 
And leads to an aching heart. 
To all who believe in passion divine. 
And on whom the fates have smiled; 
Love's filter use, but don't abuse, 
And remember, draw it mild. 
To all who would an evil shun, 
Be he defaulter or politician; 
Honor or duty can't be bought, 
So give up sordid ambition, 
Or else like evil doers, 
Upon whom riches are piled; 
A day a 
recovery soon will corn, 
IjnIM you draw it mild. 
To those, etc.

DARLING BESSIE OF THE LEA. 
As sang by John Nolan, the pleasing tenor. 
OH! I

And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime, 
But far sweeter than the roses and the streamlet unto me, 
is the sunlight face of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lee. 
Cuottus. 
She is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
Pure and gentle as an angel, darling Bessie of the les, 
Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
She is my star and treasure, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Not a 
bird in the wild wood but will answer to her call, 
Oh! most I 
love the twilight when the pearly dew-drops - all, 
Then she meets me in the valley and she kindly welcome me, 
My bonnie star of evening, darling Bessie of the lea, 
She is, &e. 
Oh I 
the hohey bee may linger where the buds and blos.socae 
grow, 
The gentle breeze of summer in its fragrance come and go, 
But they all will pass unheeded, for wherever she may be, 
My heart is full of Bessie, darling Bessie ot the lea. 
She is, tte,

PAPA, dear, come sit by Willie, 
Said a 
little dying boy, 
I 
have not long to be with you 
Ere I 
pass to peace and joy. 
His father hastened to his bedside 
And fondly his little forehead pressed; 
Death, he found, was fast approaching, 
And soon his boy would be at rest. 
Cnont:s. 
Farewell, papa, I 
must leave you! 
When I'm gene don't weep or sigh; 
Do not let this parting grieve you. 
Good- by, papa dear, good-by! 
In my visions I 
see mamma 
'Midst angels beautiful and bright, 
In robes of radiance and splendor 
Watching o'er my bed at night. 
When your darling boy has left you, 
Let me ne'er cause you grief or pain; 
Though on earth we both be parted, 
We shall meet in heaven again. 
Farewell, papa, etc. 
Oh, papa, I 
see little angels, 
With my crown their coming nigh! 
Ms father smoothed back his curly locks, 
littered naught, but gave a 
sigh. 
Reclining with his face towards heaven, 
He placed his hands across his breast; 
lie offered up a 
dying prayer, 
And passed to happiness and rest.

THE PULL-BACK DRS 
I 
OF It KIN ONLY FOUND HER. 
Written expressly for JAMES D. 
ROOME, by BEN Donok. 
I'll sing to you a 
song about 
The fashions now-a- days, 
The people all are dressing in 
Such very curious ways; 
The girls especially, who have lost 
All common sense, I 
guess, 
The way they sling themselves around 
Each one in a 
pull- back dress. 
CHORUS. 
They wear the pull-back dress, 
The late style pull-back dress, 
They pull them back, and pin them fast 
To make their skirts look less; 
Ohl that's the pull-back dress, 
The famous pull-back dress, 
Dame Fashion must have been on a 
drunk 
When she invented, the pull- back dress. 
You'll meet a 
gay and dashing girl, 
While walking down the street, 
All pinned back in her crinoline, 
The style she thinks so sweet. 
Bu if she was to tell the truth, 
She surely would confess, 
She's afraid to sit, for fear she'll bust' 
The pucker- string of her dress. 
They wear, etc. 
While out to-day, I 
met a 
girl 
Dressed in the latest style, 
A 
little mishap that she met, 
Provoked from me a 
smile; 
She stepped upon an orange-peel, 
It caused an awful mess, 
for heels flew up, her head came down, 
That settled that pull-back dress. 
They wear: etc.

WAIF OF THE CITY. 
Composed and sung by I)vjj.i 1{OCHE. 
THESE lines are founded on the real circumstance of a 
poor news boy who upon one terrible winter's night bare-
foot, hanyry, homeless, and alone died in the street. 
Ou ! 
where is that sad cry, that piteous wailing ! 
As the fierce, howling wind whistles terrific strong. 
'Tis a 
cold winter's night—frost nipping, hailing. 
Ah ! a 
sweet voice cried " pity! " Yes, sure this is wrong, 
For far in the distance of a 
dark clodded city, 
Through the gloom of the night I 
now plainly see 
The form of a 
poor ragged child craving pity. 
But alas ! death was certain and life must soon lice. 
I ' il(11;1 -S. 
If you have not the heart of a 
stone, oh, do pity ! 
Give forth a 
small mite, and never say nay, 
Remember the poor ragged waif of the city, 
And God with a 
blessing is sure to repay. 
Poor child of this cold world, thy home is not here 
No one on earth hast thou to love, 
No one to claim thee or yet shed a 
tear, 
Bat—the Father of all, our great Ruler above--
Oh God ! can it be that 'mid so many beings 
A poor, friendless creature cast in the storm 
Should starve in the city, without care or pity, 
Receive the pure soul, it has fled this bright morn. 
If you have not, etc. 
WHAT SHALL I

Written and sung by J. D. Room. 
Oh! dear, I'm alindst crazy,

So I

Oh. what shall I

The night that she did run away, 
A carriage came to the door;

And she told me to hold my jaw.

For she has sued for divorce;

Or else I'll then be forced.

THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. 
Through eating too much supper before I 
went to bed, 
Strange dreams came o'er my slumbers, 
strange thoughts 
danced through my head;

Were doing the mos peculiar things— in the world turned 
upside down. 
Beecher was running a 
faro bank, while Tilton " capped" his

tame: 
Edwin Booth went off with Barnum to take the place of clown, 
While Talmadge pla3ed in " Led Astray" in the world turned

The Prince of Wales he was elected Emperor of France, 
Moody and Sankey travelled ' round doing double song and 
dance; 
Susan B. threw off her pants and wore a 
woman's gown, 
And Henry Stanley found Bill Tweed—in the world turned up-

THE VTIFE'S DREAM. 
PRAT, tell me, Mary, how it is that you can look so gay, 
.! When evening after evening, yonr husband is away ; 
I 
never see you sulk about, nor say an angry word, 
But still you've plenty cause for tears, if all be true I've heard 
1 It is because, my sister dear, a 
husband you've ne'er wed; 
To see your children gathering round asking you for bread ; 
You ne'er can tell how it becomes a 
woman's lot through life 
, 
To be, even to a 
drunkard's life, a 
faithful, loving wife. 
But still I 
can recall the time when bitter tears I 
shed, [ said 
And when my husband staggered home, and angry words I 
I 
never thought I 
could be as cheerful as now I 
seem, [ dream. 
Yet this happy change was brought about by a 
simple little 
One eve as I 
sat waiting at our bumble cottage door, 
And listening for my husband's steps as oft I'd done before, 
!i Some wicked thoughts came in my mind, and bitterly I 
said 
I 
never wish to see him more—I 
would that he were dead. 
They say the wretched cannot rest, but sure it is not so, 
For very soon I 
fell asleop, ' midst cares of grief and woe; 
I 
dreamed I 
had my wish fulfilled—my husband was no more ; 
I 
fell upon his lifeless corpse, and kissed him o'er and o'er. 
Dearest darling, speak to me—I 
meant not what I 
said ! 
0, speak one word unto your wife—say, say you are not dead! 
0, sure I 
am not, Mary, dear— I 
woke up with a 
scream, 
And found my husband standing by—his death was but a 
dream. 
Ever since that time, whene'er I 
feel disposed to be unkind, 
The warning of that fearful dream comes fresh into my mind; 
Although it costs me many a 
pang to know the life he leads, 
I 
strive to greet him with a 
smile when oft my poor heart bleed* 
I'll humbly put my trust in God, and ask for strength to bear 
The trials He has sent on earth for all of us to share; [ life, 
And if, by patience, I 
should change my husband's wandering 
Ue'll bless the hour that dream was sent to his neglected wife.. 
The Widow in the Cottage by the Sea. 
Just one year ago to-day, love, 
I 
became your happy bride, 
Changed a 
mansion for a 
cottage, 
To dwell by the river side: 
You told me I'd be happy, 
But no happiness I 
see, 
For to- night I 
am a 
widow, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
ClIORUS.—(May be sung or omitted./ 
Alone, all alone by the sea-side he left mei 
And no other's bride I'll be; 
For in bridal flow'rs he deek'd me, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
From my cottage by the sea- side. 
I 
can see my mansion home, 
I 
can see those hills and valleys, 
Where with pleasure I 
have roamed ; 
The last time that I 
met him, 
Oh, how happy then were we, 
But to-ni•rht I 
am a 
widow, 
In the Cottage by the sea. 
CHO.— 
Oh ! my poor and aged father, 
How in sorrow he would wail, 
And my poor and aged mother, 
how in tears her eyes would swell, 
And my poor and only brother, 
Oh, how- he would weep for me, 
If he only knew his sister, 
Was a 
widow by the se.

UP TO THE MARK: 
Entered according to Art of Congress in the year 1875, by A..1 
FISHER, in the °ince of the Librarian of Congress, at Washin2ton 
Music by W M. CARTEL 
'Tis well to be up to the mark, my boys, 
Just think of the days gone by, 
When Washington planted our flag, my boys, 
And raised our bright banner on high ; 
When Jefferson stood by the land of the free! 
And Lafayette, too, he fought in the field, 
When first shone our stars in the face of the foe, 
Those stars and those stripes which never did yield. 
CHORUS. 
For those men were up to the mark, my boys, 
They brought sweet sunlight front the dark, 
And made this great land where we live, my boys, 
And proved themselves up to the mark. 
And they'll find the North pole before long, my boy-4 
Or travel that Northern sea through, 
Or die at their post like brave Hall, my boys, 
'Neath the icebergs of cold 82 ; 
We Yankees, ' tis said, through this world, my boys, 
Do know not the meaning of defeat, or fail ; 
Our banner will soon be nufurl'd, my boys, 
The future will tell of the tale. 
CHORUS. 
We've men left like Morton and Hayes, my boys, 
One failure but kindles the spark, 
And brings to the surface them all, my boys, 
'I hose men that are up to the mark.

In Harlem Lane, there once did dwell a 
charming little bean.

It makes me feel so jolly you know; 
0, squeeze me, Joe, 0, squeeze me, Joe, 
And if you love me tell me so. 
He kept a 
pretty little farm, and horses he had three, 
So he said, my dear, there'll be no harm to take a 
ride with me

cried, don't

really can't say no; 
I'll be your wife and joy through life, if you'll only squeeze me

I 
married him then, and now am happy as can be, 
For the little farm, and all its charms of course belong to me,

Who thinks it is no sin; 
And if by chance the Thomas cat 
Held big car's and went out, 
The ( lephant would then get mad 
And " trump" him with his snout 
I've seen a

Go "courting in the rain;" 
The snake was mean and vicious, 
And the lizard she was vain; 
Says snakey: " Will you have mer 
Says she " You'll never do."

And hit her nibs in two.

She carried a

She said her father owned a

This nice young girl from Harlem. 
She said she was going to meet her In, 
Her little brother and dear mania, 
She was " giving me taffy " and " tra-la-la-la," 
This nice young girl from Harlem. 
We left the car and took a 
cruise, 
I 
swore this gal I'd never lose, 
Bought lager beer and seventeen stews 
For this nice young girl from Harlem. 
In about two hours she got her fill, 
Then asked me to loan her a 
ten dollar bill, 
Said she'd come back— but

I'll sing you a

She dresses in the fashion, 
And she wears a

Her feet are like canal boats, 
And her ears are loin, and slender; 
Iler ather keeps a

Way out in Kalamazoo, 
CHORUS. 
She's my darting 7,lichigander— 
She's aa alab , ster rose; 
Her ears are Long, her voice is strong, 
She wears a 
Roman nose. 
She iu ,rodes the hash, she's on the math 
M st every where she goes— 
She's my Kalamazan-go-zander, 
Kalamazander, Alabazan.

Gehoshehopper; 
Her father's name is Jehoshifat, 
With my skimynnarinky day. 
Sh_e swears according to Hoyle, 
And you bet its hard to beat her— 
She can lather and shave an elephant's trunk, 
And chew hay like a 
cow. 
She's my darlimr, 
She went out to join the circus. 
And she used to feed the monkeys, 
And (+,au thehippopotanius, 
And she used to chew the glue. ( Bang.) 
But the camel got his back up 
With a 
pair of Barnum's donkeys, 
Chewed v.p her shoes and stockings, 
With my Hoopdedoodendo. 
She's my darling, & e.

And the seal beat time with the drum;

At the big Aquarium.

She's purty, but she's dark ; 
And when she laughed and opened her mouth. 
I 
thought she'd swallow the shark. 
The lobster smiled- and sucked his thumb, 
And laid as still as death; 
When the turtle winked his eye at Sal, 
It nearly took her breath. 
Oh, the big sea lion, etc.

But the porpoise cleared the track : 
The eel he tied himself in a

And the crab walked on his back. 
The trout and the catfish danced a

BOLIVAR BILL, 
Written by JIM MASS. 
Sung by J. D. Roomm 
Bolivar Bill was a 
pea-nut man, 
And he had a 
lovely daughter, 
With eyes that looked like oyster-shells, 
And nose as fiat as a 
quarter; 
She was graceful as a 
cord of wood, 
Her feet was full of bunions, 
Her mouth was as wide as the Erie canal, 
And her breath was as sweet as onions. 
Ono.—And she'd say oh, my! fie, for shame! 
Do you carry a 
pop, sir? 
Go, take a 
drop, sir. 
Oh, my! fie. for shame ! 
Jimmie, I 
think you're too fresh. 
She dressed up in the latest style, 
She looked just like a 
clothes- rack, 
With a 
horse's tail for a 
water-fall, 
And a 
dish- rag for a 
pin- back, 
With government shoes, about nineteen, 
With a 
brick- bat for a 
locket, 
And a 
big tin pan for a 
diamond pin, 
And a 
ham- bone in her pocket. 
Cno.—And he'd say, Tat, tar! tat, tar! my baby dear, 
I'll meet you in the park 
If you treat to lager beer; 
Now, don't you think yourself, 
That you are a 
little queer, 
And, I 
think, the best thing you can do, 
l 
s 
slide off on your ear. 
She fell in love with a 
nice young man, 
And tried his heart to slaughter, 
His hair was red, his teeth were loose, 
And he peddled chalk and water, 
lie used to drive a 
stump- tail mule, 
With eyes that folks call gugle, 
And when he went to see his girl, 
lie whistled Yankee Doodle. 
Guo.—For he was " the belle of the ball," yes, 
le wouldn't have it at all, yes, 
llc sheried he shook her,

he had a

BROOKLYN'S GREAT FIRE, 
Composed by P. J. 
DOWNEY. 
(Air—" Sailor's Return." 
51 
It was on a 
Tuesday night, as the stars were shining 
bright, 
When this happened which I'll now relate to you ; 
It's about this sad affair that you bear most everywhere, 
And that o'er our pleasant city spread a 
gloom. 
It of the young and old I'll tell, how their dear lives they 
did sell, 
And who suffered, God only knows what pain; 
But I 
hope they're now at rest, in heaven with the blest, 
And with pain thgv111 ne'er be troubled any more. 
(Repeat last four lines.) 
It was, on this fatal night, when with faces that were 
bright 
That those people they all left their happy homes ; 
If the " Two Orphans" they could see, how happy they 
would be, 
And all to the Brooklyn Theatre they did go. 
The place it was filled soon, and some left for want of 
room, 
And them that got seats thought that they were lucky ; 
But it's little did they know the trouble or the woe, 
That they were about to leave upon this earth. 
(Repeat last fi,ur 
They all sat there with glee and the falling sparks ( lid see, 
And they most all thought that it was in the play ; 
But when they saw the flames and smoke they saw it was 
no joke, 
'It's then they ran excited for the door. 
Some fell upon the floor, from which they rose no more, 
And God help the women, you could hear them cry, 
And young men there with their wives, asking God to 
save their lives, 
But it seemed they all were led there to die.

SAY, Jack, I've been bothered some lately, 
By the poems that come from the West, 
About Heathen Chinees playing poker, 
With Bill Nye and all of the rest, 
But why don't they write of our city, 
About us and our big diamond pins. 
Where we always play keno and faro, 
And commit other such innocent sins. 
This is the town for big butlers, 
Where the elephant can always be seen, 
And pocket-book-droppers are waiting 
To play tricks upon those who are green. 
if those fellows would like to play poker, 
t 
them come here—we'll rope them in, 
Alia we'll fight them with pops or with bowie,

BARBER AND BUTCHER. 
Banjo Solo by BILLY W EST, 
I'll sing of a 
darkie that lived in this city, 
He was a 
melodious and sweet-scented coon; 
Ilk hatr it was curly, his heels double-jointed, 
He was chief engineer cf a 
barber saloon. 
To see him each mornirg a 
handling the razor. 
The people would gather in crowds round the door , 
And all would exclaim as 
slapped on the lather, 
Such a 
sweet- scented barber they ne'er saw before. 
There was a 
young maiden, her name was O'Brien, 
Provost Marshal was she in a 
kitchen close by ; 
She would pass by the shop on her way to the market, 
And in at the barber she'd throw it sheep's eye. 
The barber would wait till he saw her returning, 
And quietly then to the door he would come ; 
And a 
box of pomade he'd slip into her basket. 
And then drink her health in a 
pint of Bay ROHL 
But a 
young butcher boy by the name cf Hans Schneider, 
lie heard of the barber and jealous he grew ; 
He loaded a 
bladder with kidneys, and doughnuts, 
And straight for the sweet- scented barber he flew. 
Then the battle commenced and the slaughter was awful, 
They with murder intent on ( a.eli other did rush : 
But the barber he soon got the lest of the butcher, 
He blew out his brains with a 
lathering brush. 
When Matilda O'Brien she heard of the slaughter. 
She made up her mind to commit suieide; 
She swallowed three gallons of brandy and water, 
And then she went down in the cellar and died. 
Then the barber went crazy and busted his Inkiness, 
At policy played and his money- let fly ; 
Ile melted and melted clear down to a 
shadow. 
Then poisoned LintskIts with it box of hair klyo. 
As sung by ANDY COLLOM, at Toy PASTOR'S, 13'way, N. Y. 
There was a 
young man who never had his health, 
He was subject to all kinds of ills ; 
He went down in town on Sunday afternoon, 
And bought a 
box of Vegetable Pills. 
He took twenty-six, and then he went to bed, 
And soon he was fast asleep • 
And to his surprise wheu he open'd up his eyes, 
He was turned to a 
big dead-beat. 
SPOKEN. —
That's the reason, Ladies and Gentlemen, you 
should never partake of those luxuries commonly called 
Vegetable Pills— 
CHORITS. 
For if you do, surely you'l rue it, 
Though strange to you it seems, 
For how funny you would look, all strung upon a 
hook, 
And all turned into beans. 
The old woman was taken with a 
pain in her head, 
And she sent for her darling Lou ; 
She says, go bring me that same box of pills, 
And I 
think I 
shall try some too. 
But the pills made her worse when she sent for the nurse ; 
After taking in a 
great big number, 
When she look'd in the glass she was just as green as grass, 
She had turned to a 
big cucumber ! 
For if you do, Sx. 
Now the old pussie cat was looking for a 
rat, 
When she spied that box of pills ; 
She was looking all around when she gobbl'd them down, 
She thought they would cure all her ills ; 
But then the fun begun when the cat began to run 
From the cellar clear up to the garret; 
And her body it turned to a 
barrel of sour krout, 
And her tail it turned into a 
carrot ! 
SroxEN.—As I 
said before, Ladies and Gentlemen—

BIG-FOOT SAL, 
Banjo Solo. 
Written by J. L. FREENY, expressly for JAmEs D. 
ROOME, Banjoist. 
The gal that I 
will sing about, 
Is very fond of me 
• 
Around the waist she's very stout, 
And stands about ten foot three. 
Her foot is a 
tremendous size— 
She wears number twenty-two; 
Her ears are like an elephant's, 
And she walks like a 
kangaroo. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, big-foot Sal, she's the gal, 
That's known by every one; 
She can waltz on her ear, and drink lager beer, 
And she weighs about five ton. 
She can sing, and play the old banjo, 
At that she can't be beat; 
And dance the light fantastic toe, 
With her tremendous feet. 
Her mouth resembles a 
railroad tunnel; 
She presents a 
terrible sight; 
Fier hand would cover an acre of ground: 
Like a 
bull- dog she can tight. 
Oh, big- foot Sal, etc. 
She went to a 
ball the other night, 
And what do you think she done ? 
To raise a 
muss, she put out the light, 
Then took to her heels and run. 
The gals did scream, the men did shout, 
To catch that crazy gal; 
But there wasn't a 
man with pluck enough, 
To tackle big-foot Sal. 
Oh, big- foot Sal, etc. 
Originally sung by VIRGINIA S,TICKNEY. 
We met and we flirted, you and I, 
In a 
beer garden not long ago. 
And oh we were happy you and I. 
As the lager down our throats did flow, 
We threw two glasses, you and I, 
In the gutter as it glided on, 
While the Dutchman sadly us did eye. 
And the waiters as they slowly passed along; 
And oh we were broke then you and I, 
And felt that our life's pleasant dream, 
Must end, for the police very soon 
Would find out what dead beats we had been. 
We sat in the parlor, you and I, 
A 
nd married six months we had been, 
I 
thought we'd be happy, you and I, 
But soon found out that I'd been taken in. 
We fought like two eats then, you and I, 
And my hair, oh how tightly 3-on hung on. 
You then hauled off and blacked my eye. [corn.

But Butler thought he'd get aboard, by some means or an-
other, 
So he struck the plank, and made a

the other; 
They tugged away with might and main, to see who'd get on

Old Noah cried, get off, you beats, I'm afraid the boiler ' 11

They jumped aboard, ' twits hard to tell who first got on the

But the steam was up,and soon this gallant craft was all afloat.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is tne old-
est and, most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years. and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arrnged and printed in series—II( arts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
sneers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playiug is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. Ei. 
anclosed in handsome case 
Price 25 Cents. 
Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
le meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-oommittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too die. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of qeestions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
el it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the tut-
Corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Keening Telegram. writes: " We ha-. e 
lately seen 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing 'twenty-five cents, called the 
Little Flirt," published by A. J. neural., No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the moclus op( randi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recoaa-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
