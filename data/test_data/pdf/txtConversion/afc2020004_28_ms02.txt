START OF RECORDING 
 
Laura Tohe:  This recording took place on July 10, 2020. It was recorded in Dez Tillman’s Sonic 
Alchemy Studio in Phoenix, Arizona. This poem is written by Laura Tohe.  
 
[Laura Tohe reads “Within Dinétah the People’s Spirit Remains Strong”] 
 
LT:  This is my commentary on “Within Dinétah the People’s Spirit Remains Strong.” Over a 
hundred years after the forced removal and imprisonment of the Diné people at Hweeldi also 
known as Fort Sumner from 1864 to 1868, my poem reflects on this historic and horrific 
removal from the homeland within the boundaries of the four mountains, sentinels that mark 
the ancestral homeland, order, and stability for the Diné people. In the era of Manifest Destiny, 
this poem looks at how the Diné viewed themselves as part of the larger world and how they 
endured removal that changed them after their return.
