THE CANDY GIRL AND MARGY. Talk about your girls setting in your settee?,I've one that you can
never beat.All day long she stands behind the counterDealing out the things that are so sweet.She's
as sweet as any of the candy,And her smile would put you in a whirl.Every day at four I wait outside
the doorTo walk home with the candy girl of mine.Eyes as dark as the chocolate creams,Lips just as-
sweet as the jelly beans,Just, like a wafer of high degree,She's a nonpareil ?, she looks good to me.I'm
her taffy, she's won my heart, [?]And from my butterscotch I never will part.Like a nectarine, she
comes in my dreams,That candy girl of mine.Margy, I idolize you.Oh, how I prize you, my little darling!
Sweeter than the honey that's made by the bee,Fair as a flushing rose,Always we'll be together.I'll be
your queen, dove,And you'll be a dean ? in November,And I want you to rememberMargy, you're the
girl I love.
