You Riofisters Don't Make Me No Droubles 
Entered acsordeing to Act of congress, in the year 1881, by A. J. FISHER, 
24 VeSe:y St., in Me Offce of the Librarian of Congress, 
at IVaskington, D. C. 
Words and music composed by HARRY HOGAN, as done by the HOGAN 
Baos. in all the principal Theatres throughout the U. S. 
On the coast near the South Atlantic sea, 
The land where they grow the rice and corn, 
And sugar-cane you'll see 
In the clime where we were born; 
Beneath the sun's warm glow, (vm.) 
In that sunny land so far away, 
Where the rivers Nile and Congo flow; 
There the coons are light and gay, 
And while the hours away, 
With us Nigs of the Mozambique. 
CHORUS: 
To sing and dance is our delight. 
(
brork.) 
And we are happy day or night. 
(
break.) 
When the rays of the silver moon did shine, 
And the stars did twinkle bright and clear; 
Then we had a 
golden time, 
With those from far and near, 
Us Nigs of the Mozambique. 
We worked in the fields of sugar-cane, 
From early morn until sundown, 
It was there we gained our name, 
For miles and miles around; 
All among the yellow boys, 
At night when all our work was done, 
We'd sing and dance and make a 
noise, 
It was then we had the fun, 
When the sun had gone to rest, 
Us l'•ags of the Mozambique,

HOMELESS TO-NIGHT. 
Words and Music by HARRY HOGAN, of the HOGAN BROS. 
Respectfully dedicated to M. S., of New York. 
Wandering through the streets so cheerless, 
From dawn until the close of day, 
Amid the Winter's storm so fearless, 
Beneath a 
sky all cold and gray; 
For food and shelter I 
am longing— 
Oh! God, but pity me to- night, 
Here in the streets I 
am dying, 
I'm footsore and homeless to- night. 
CHORUS: 
Homeless to-night, cheerless I 
stray, 
Sadly I 
ponder o'er life's weary flight— 
Dark is my life, drear is my way, 
I'm cheerless and homeless to-night. 
1 
have stopped each stranger passing, 
And told to all my tale of woe; 
With scorn they look, their path resuming, 
Not caring to hear of my sorrow. 
Perhaps at their homes all is cheerful, 
And comfort reigns there to-night; 
But to me all is desolate and fearful, 
For I'm footsore and homeless to night, 
HAPPY BOYS FROM BORNEO. 
Words and Music composed by HARRY HOGAN. 
As done by the 
HOGAN BROS., at " Harry Miner's Theatre," New York, in 
their famous Hottentot Act. 
When day is o'er and the sun has gone to rest, 
Down behind the clouds of blue; 
When the moon shone bright, we felt the best, 
For our pleasure would then commence, we knew. 
Our hearts were light, and we were ever bright, 
As the days that come and go; 
To dance and sing from morn till night, 
Was a 
pleasure to us boys of Borneo. 
CHORUS: 
Laughing, singing, we are always glad, 
(
Break). 
And you'll find our hearts are never sad. (
Break). 
With hearts of glee, we are just as free, 
As the tide at evening's flow; 
And just as lively as can be, 
We're two happy little boys from Borneo. 
In our little hut of clay down in that sunny land, 
Where we first saw the light of day; 
There the sun shines bright on the golden sand, 
From the morning until the close of day. 
But at eve, when all is still and calm, 
To the riverside we'd go; 
Or 'neath the waving trees of palm, 
Were these happy little boys from Borneo. 
Words and Music by J. K. Jonysos. Sung with great 
success by the HCGANS. 
Lolling ' midst a 
lovely bed of roses, 
Lending ear to natures melody, 
Leaflets sighing, wafted by the breezes, 
Seem to whisper loving words to me. 
Trifling birds among the trees were flitting, 
Filling with sweet song the wood and dell, 
Over all the golden sun was setting, 
Still I 
dreamed of naught but Floribel. 
Cnonus: 
Lightly as a 
fawn, o'er the grassy lawn, 
/ainty Florie's footsteps fell, 
In a 
happy dream, by the silver stream, 
Toward our tryst, the woodland dell. 
Fairies bursting forth from rosy petals— 
;:m(etest prison, dewy- scented cell— 
Gambling gayly o'er the flowery arbor, 
Could not e'er compare with Floribel. 
AL
-14)wn the lane over clover-blossoms, 
Gracefully among the flowers she'll glide; 
At last she's here, darling angel Florie, 
Now she sits so cosy by my side. 
Lovely hair in sunlight glinting golden, 
Features rare of roes and of cream; 
And her merry, gayly joyous laughter, 
Seemeth like the music of a 
dream. 
Eyes like velvet bathed in softest starlight, 
Windows of the soul, sweet shaded wells; 
The wedding day is named, and joyous pleasure, 
Soon will peal our merry marriage bells. 
words and music by Hanny HooAI•:. 
As done by the itooAs imos. 
at the Vine Strect Opera House, Cincinnati, 0. 
All around for many a 
mile, 
From the Congo to the Nile, 
From the burning juligle to the river's tide, 
There, working side by side 
In fields of cane and corn. 
Is the land where we were bred and born. 
From morning until night 
Our hearts were ever light, 
And dancine. used to lend to us a 
charm. 
Wan the golden moon so calm 
At night its light did .shine 
On us happy little Congo nigs. 
Cnours: 
Two gum elastic rubber figs are we, 
And we are just as limber as can be; 
Oh, we are never sad, 
And our hearts are always glad, 
We never know a 
sorrow or a 
pain. 
When in the fields of cane 
We're as merry as can be, 
Us happy lath; Congo nigs. 
Beneath a 
sky of gold, 
We never could grow old, 
Or even tire of dancing all the day; 
But while the hours away 
With spirits light and free, 
From the land out to the far off sea. 
Our biggest joy at night 
Was when the moon shone bright 
To gather by our little hut of straw; 
There by its open door, 
Such merry hours we spent, 
Us happy little Congo nigs.

Then they Chase the Landlord from the Door. 
Written by Edwin Talbot for Pat Rooney and sung by him 
with great success. 
AIR— " 
Never take the Horseshoe from the Door," as sung 
by Harrigan & Hart. 
Every month the rent is handed to the landlord, 
In the tenement house, where the families congregate, 
Then Mrs. Duffy says that Mrs. Reilly's daughter, 
In the sink threw dirty cabbage and corn mate. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, then they get a 
drinking and a 
slugging, 
It's worse than listening. 
to the Pinafore, 
But when Kelly throws ashes at Terry Monaghans mother, 
Arrah, it's then then they chase the landlord from thci 
door. 
Mrs. McNally had sixteen shirts upon a 
clothes line, 
And a 
brand new suit of dresses from the store, 
Young Kelly's son be stole them and he pawned them, 
You can bet she chased the young kid from the door. 
Last night her daughtcr Mary Ann the speeler, 
\Vas standing with a 
young man she met before, 
some one dropped out a 
scuttle full of cinders, 
To chase the dizzy lovers from the door, 
The milk is left up in the hallway every morning, 
From Jacob McCarthy's german grocery store, 
When he tries to collect his bill they give him warning, 
Aud chase the poor old tuilkmac. from the door.

PARODY ON PITCHER OF BEER, 
As sung by HAnaloA.N .
3: HART in the Mulligan Guard's Picnic. 
Writeen by JAMES RICHMOND. 
I 
am a 
friend to the Millionaire, when he is drunk, 
Though from a 
Millionaire I 
am far away; 
My Pa he is rich, he owns a 
wood's and a 
ditch, 
And gets seventy-five cents every day. 
He spends money free for coffee and tea, 
And often it does turn his brain; 
To see himself drinking water because he is poor, 
And the rich drink from their bottle 6f champagne 
Cnours: 
Then each week in the night, each year in the monvh, 
It will snow, it will blow, or it will rain; 
While the rich is draining beer-kegs on some lonely street, 
While the poor man is drinking champagne. 
The poor go to Long Branch for the good of their hedith 
The Herald and the Sun is the proof; 
They smoke a2.00 cigars, go in bathing in silks, 
While the rich have to sleep on the roof. 
Its a 
shame poor factory girls can't wear diamond ring. 
If she catches a 
mash at a 
ball, he is insane; 
He'll buy her a 
doughnut and a 
three cent lemonade, 
And imagine she is drinking champagne. 
Crtonus: 
Then take my advice, sleep on a 
cake of ice, 
If you're got a 
bad reputation, rub out the stain; 
The Queen of Cincinnati has to drink milk, 
While Dennis Kearney is drinking _ champagne. 
WHEN THE FLOWERS ARE ASLEEP. 
Written by CHARLES H. 
DocKsrauTErt, and sung by DAN COLLYER, 
with Tony Pastor's Immense Company. 
Where the watermelons grow, 
The wind in the key of G 
cloth blow; 
Where the rippling waters ramble, 
O'er the mossy jack-stones; 
Meet me with thy glossy smile, 
Blushes fan thy granite brow; 
Sylph-lolke glide thy cow-hide footsteps, 
Oh, ho, ho, hallo me Hannah. 
CHOltUS: 
When the flowers walk in their sleep, 
And the night-mare trots the deep, 
Come back home in your bare feet, 
Beloved, fair one, me Annie. 
When thy young heart's pure and free, 
Beats, dead beats, alone for me; 
Musha Mickey, Mikey, oh, ho, ho, ho, 
Thin be jabers, Annie; 
Ach du bist verrtickt mein kind, 
Pigeon-toed are thy footsteps; 
Hear the hydrant how it fizzles, 
Down by the Tan Yard, me Annie. 
CHORUS: 
When the flowers are sound asleep, 
And the willows sob and weep, 
Rush back home and let us eat, 
Oh, ho, ho, be gosh, me A.nnic..

Of all the young swells that you ever seen, 
There's none for to equal us two La Da Das; 
We have just come over from the land of the green, 
Where we left the gang and our Ma Mas. 
We are n'oted for being two bashful young men, 
Especially where ladies are found; 
If you go into any of the fashionable balls, 
You will hear the word go around. 
CII0ItITS: 
Oh, my! ain't they two babies, 
Look at the swells with the glass on their eye; 
Oh, yes, they're the pets of the ladies, 
Clarence and Arthur, now don't they look fly. 
Now Clarence and Arthur, as everyone knows, 
Drinks wine from the keg as fast as it flows; 
Although we are not lushers that have a 
red nose; 
We go for the bowl as far as it goes. 
We don't care for money although we have none, 
Our parents are very well off; 
We get through on our face, if not on our shape, 
We are Clarence and Arthur the toffs. (Chorus),

Parody on Full Moons. 
Written by Edwin Talbot, and sang with great success by 
Billy Carter. 
The noble order of Ancient Bums, 
That ain't got any stamps, 
Are trying to form a 
No-work Club 
With the always-idle tramps. 
They sit in overy public park, 
Or lay upon the grass, 
And beg a 
chew of tobacco, boys, 
From any one who'l pass. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
Then march down Broadway, 
They pick up stumps and work the pumps, 
They're the terrors of the day. 
CHORUS. 
When the little tramps are begging, 
They say they never begged before, 
They'll sleep in a 
cart or some alley, 
And beg at every basement, basement door. 
They take the road the 1st of may, 
Put lightning on their heels, 
And steal the farmers chickens and corn 
If they don't get three square meals; 
Beat every freight train in the land, 
When they're catched they make 'em sick, 
And when snow falls upon the ground 
To the city double quick. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
They're as quiet as a 
mouse when asking 
The Captain of Police fcr to sleep in the Station flouSe. 
Chorus.

BARNUM'S COMICAL MICK. 
-
:0:-
Written and sung by FERGUSON ct MACK, with TONY PASTORS 
Immense Company. 
-:o:-
We're the Pudding Brothers, Tom and Jerry, 
We throw somersaults on our gums; 
We get four hundred a 
week of P. T. Parnum, 
For walking on our thumbs; 
We jump ov(r seventeen elephants at once, 
Do a 
flip-flop on a 
pie; 
Walk on our teeth, fall on our ear, 
And dance upon our eye. 
CHORUS: 
Jump on our neck, run on our tongue, 
We do all the breakneck tricks; 
They know us by the name we bear, 
It's Barnum's Comical Micks. 
We juggle cannon balls weighing a 
thousand pounds, 
If you don't believe us, you are a 
liar; 
Leap eight hundred feet, catch a 
spool of thread, 
Surrounded by brimstone and fire; 
We got forty-two cast-iron medals, 
From the King of China and Mayor of France; 
We made them laugh for seven months, 
Sure we thought they'd bust their pants.' 
P 
Written by JOHN WALsn, and sung with great success 
all over the world. 
Many a 
man grows tired and weary, 
As he toils life's road along; 
Everything looks dark and dreary, 
All he does seems to go wrong; 
Yet, I 
say, never be despairing, 
Fortune yet may smile some day; 
And her gifts with you be sharing, 
So remember what I 
say. 
CHORUS: 
Never, boys, give way to sorrow, 
Sighing only is in vain; 
For the sun will shine to-morrow, 
And the grass will grow again. 
Though false friends should all forsake you, 
Laugh their dirty trick to scorn; 
Luck some day may overtake you, 
When you look the most forlorn; 
Troubles in this world are plenty, 
Few from them are always free; 
Though your pockets should be empty, 
Still take this advice from me. (Chorus). 
Sung by BILLY COTTON. 
Gone am de days, 
When my heart was young and gay,

When I 
landed at Castle Garden, 
About ten years ago, 
I 
made my home in a 
tenement house, 
In Cherry street below, 
'Twas there I 
got acquainted 
Wid a 
German girl so gay, 
It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day. 
CHORUs. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, 
We'll ring a 
wreath for thee, 
All the little children, 
Sang so sweet to me; 
Ladies came in carriages, 
With presents and boquets, 
To little Michael Callihan, 
Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout, 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gaily did turn out; 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had funny things to say 
To Mike and Lena Callihan, 
Upon their wedding day. - (Chorus.) 
There was August Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry Ciselmyer, 
With all my wife's relations, 
And Cohn the old clothes buyer. 
My brothers Pat and Danny, 
Wid the ladies danced the glide, 
Bet the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to'kiss the bride.

In Scotland, France and Germany, 
Music you will hear, 
The Italian loves to play the harp, 
He plays so soft and clear. 
Sweet music always charms my ear, 
Wherever it may be, 
love to hear Tom Moore's sweet songs, 
They have such harmony. 
CIIORVB. 
I 
love music, I 
love singing, 
I 
love dancing—it's entrancing, 
I 
love babies, I 
love ladies, 
Yes, they're all the world to me. 
The Irish songs are soft and sweet, 
They harmonize so well, 
The Meeting of the Waters, 
Or the Emigrant's Fareweh. 
There's Bobby Burns, the great Scotch poet, 
Whose memory shall reign 
In Scotland where he lived and died, 
And honored was his name. 
(Ch.orus.): 
In speaking of our poets great, 
There's one now whom I'll name, 
his praise is sung both far and near, 
He's well known for his fame. 
'Tis of William Cullen Bryant I 
speak, 
Who Americans will adore, 
this works are read throughoutthis world, 
From this to foreign shore.

SOMETHING TO TICKLE THE GIRLS. 
Written by A. W . 
FRENCH. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre C,c!mique. 
• Music by T. B. 
KELLEY. 
The pet of the girls ev'ry where, 
Society calls me a 
wit; 
For nothing gets on unless there, 
1 
drop in to please them a 
bit; 
I've stories not few, and jokes that are new, 
As brilliant they tell rne as pearls; 
NoLseuse now and then is liked by all men, 
Of course it will tickle the girls. 
CHORUS' 
Someth_ng to tickle the girls, 
Laughing and shaking their curls; 
You'll not go amiss, I 
promise you this, 
With something to tickle the girls. 
Some chaps they are terrible bores, 
Some spoony and dull as a 
hoe; 
No kind that a 
gay girl adores, 
She favors no one who is slow; 
Some fellows are shy, and others they try, 
To please when as crabbid as churls; 
I'm not either one, I 
can revel in fun, 
And can always tickle the girls. 
(Chorus). 
Then take my advice ev'ry one, 
And put it at once to the test; 
Go in with the girls and have fun, 
For that is just what suits them best; 
They like a 
gay heart, who does well his part, 
To cheer them as life swiftly whirls; 
You're always their friend, to love and commend, 
With something to tickle the girls. 
(Chorus).

Good evening, kind friends, we have just stepped in, 
If you'll listen, we'll tell who we are; 
We are a 
pleasant old couple as you can see, 
ALA we are known both near and far; 
We are old and gray, and we are on our way, 
Through the pathway of life; 
And as we pass by, the young folks they cry, 
There's old Mr. Logan and wife. 
CHORts: 
He.—For I'm old Mr. Logan, 
She.—I'm Mrs. Logan, 
Both.—Old Mr. Logan and wife; 
She's Mrs. Logan, I'm Mr. Logan, 
Old Mr. Logan and wife. ( Repeat). 
We've settled down for life you see, 
In our little old country home; 
Two boys and a 
girl was our happy lot, 
So you see we are not left alone; 
Our life's a 
dream, with joy supreme, 
Devoid of care and strife; 
And as we pass by, the young folks all say,

I 
will tell you of a 
lady, 
One I 
love so well, 
Bonnets and ribbons she does sell; 
On the I3owery she owns a 
store, 
She has " " 
on the door, 
And Augustine Delia Clancey that's the bell^e. 
Shure it's every Sunday night, 
It is my heart's delight 
To go up Miss Clancey for to see. 
A 
grand piano she plays so fine, 
To me she is divine, 
And all those lovely songs she sings to me. 
CHORUS. 
She sings, she sings Sweet Bye and Bye, 
And go to sleep my Baby Mine. 
She sings, she sings such pretty tunes, 
The girl I 
love I'll marry soon. 
There is Owen Smith and Grady, 
The Misses Scott and Doyle, 
Sitting in the parlor all so fine. 
Sure Smithy has comical talk, 
And such a 
funny walk, 
Which causes all the party for to smile. 
When Miss Clancey does appear 
Such curious things you'll hear, 
" 
Miss Clancey, dear, you're looking all serene," 
She smiles and bows her head, 
To the piano she lightly treads, 
And all those loyely songs she sings to me. 
She sings, she sings, &c.

The prettiest girl in all this town lives just across the way 
I'm going to call on her and see if site will name the day; 
She is very sweet on both of us, which one she cannot say, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. 
She promised to be mine, and aid how happy we would he 
Before I 
went away she said she loved no one but me; 
She may be fooling both of us, but now we're going to see 
Which one shall wed Miss Katie Ann O'Connor. 
CHOI117S; 
Katie Ann O'Connor she is the prettiest girl I 
know, 
Katie Ann O'Connor said I 
might be her beau; 
She is sweeter than the flowers that in the garden grow, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. ( Repeat). 
Now 
all the boys around the town have got her on the brain 
The girls they are so jealous that they're mighty near insane; 
But Katie she don't notice it, she loves me just the same, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. 
So now we are going to leave you, and will come som e 
other time, 
And when we do, we'll let you know when the marriage 
bells does chime; 
To the wedding we'll invite you all, and won't we have a 
time, 
With this pretty girl, Miss Katie Ann O'Connor.

STOP AS LONG AS YOU USED TO. 
As King with great success by Miss JENNIE HUGHES. 
I 
know a 
jolly old bachelor, 
Who lives next door to me, 
Though he is thought a 
bit of a 
bore, 
In jolly good company ; 
For he is such an inquisitive man, 
That if you e'er should meet, 
He'll button- hole you if he can, 
And give you the following treat. 
CHORUS.—Does your mother take in washing ? 
Has she sold her mangle ? 
What's become of the old piano, 
Your sister used to strangle? 
Has your father plenty of work ? 
Does he still get boozed too ? 
Tell Inc all the particulars, 
And stop as long as you used to. 
Now this old man has lots of wealth, 
So he's not without a 
few, 
Choice friends who'll call to dr!nk his health, 
And borrow a. pound or two; 
But the (Adman cross-examines them so, 
That they're glad to get away, 
As rich as they came, and as out they go, 
With a 
grill on his face he will say. 
Cimuus.—Does your mother, &c. 
This bachelor's blessed with a 
lovely niece, 
His heiress ' so they say, 
So I 
thought I'd try to be in the piece, 
And told my love one day : 
"Oh speak to my Uncle, sir," she said, 
" 
With his consent %veil wed," 
So I 
asked him if she could he my bride, 
When he drew me aside, and said. 
CHOlius.—Does your mother, & c. 
The ladies give him their sweetest smiles, 
And flatter and coax him so, 
But he can see through their artful wiles, 
Though his knowledge he does not show. 
They make him presents of gloves and ties, 
And handkerchiefs white as snow, 
Which he will wave before their eyes, 
Asi he asks with a 
chuckle and crow. 
CHORUS.—Doev your mother, SLe.

—:o:— 
Mrs. Brady, a 
widow lady, 
has a 
daughter that I 
adore; 
I 
go to court her, across the water, 
Every Sunday afternoon at four; 
She sings so sweetly, she dresses so neatly, 
So like a 
fairy she trips the floor; 
She's good society, she's full of piety, 
And her mother keeps a 
little candy store. 
CHORUS: 
Dainty feet, measured beat, 
Trips the street; oh! so neat; 
Dresses sweet, what a 
treat, 
And her mother keeps a 
candy store; 
Her name is Norah, I 
do adore her, 
She's like an angel, my heart is so sore; 
She's like a 
daisy, she sets me crazy, 
And her mother keeps a 
liftle condy store. 
(Dance). 
Every Sunday, and every Monday, 
With the family I 
go to dine; 
And the daughter, I 
do escort her, 
Every evening till the clock strikes nine; 
One Summer evening, the moon was beaming 
I 
said I 
loved her as dear as life; 
She blushed completely and smiled so sweetly 
Yet she promised she'd be my darling wife. 
Catfish running down de stream, 
Yes, my love, I'll meet you, 
Turtle ask him what he mean, 
I'll meet you by and by. 
Turtle caught him by de moufe, 
Yes, my love, I'll meet you, 
And turned his jacket inside out, 
I'll meet you by and by. 
Den hoe dat corn, hoe dat corn, Moses, 
Den hoe dat corn, I'll meet you oy and by. 
CHORUS. 
Get away from that window, my love and my dove, 
Get away from dat window I 
say; 
I'll be here some other night, 
Kase dar's gwine to be a 
fight, 
Dare'll be razors flying in de air, 
Get away, (sym.) get away, (sym.) 
Get away you sassy nigger. 
(Repeat chorus.) 
I 
went down to Shilam town, 
Yes, my love, I'll meet you, 
Bull- frog kicked all de houses down, 
I'll meet you by and by, 
I 
buy my bread and eat my crumbs,_ 
Yes, my love, I'll meet you, 
Rabbits bit off bole my thumbs, 
I'll meet you by and by. 
Den hoe dat corn, hoe dat corn, Moses, 
Den hoe dat corn, I'll meet you by and by. 
Get away from dat window, &c. 
UNCLE ABE AND SISTER RUTH. 
Composed and Sung by JOHNSON & POWERS. 
Lend us your attention, 
And we're sure you'll easily guess, 
That we're a 
pair of Quakers. 
You can tell it by our dress; 
We're very sanctimonious, 
Never struggling with the truth, 
Uncle Abe and sister Ruth. 
Cnottus: 
Then oh! my! we feel delicious, 
Then oh! my! we feel delicious, 
Then oh! my! we feel delicious, 
And dancing's our delight. 
We never let the congregation, 
Know we dance and sing; 
They'd elevate their eyes and say, 
It's not the proper thing. 
We 
steal away to visit you, 
And please you ' tis the truth, 
Uncle Abe and sister Ruth. 
We're going back to Quakertown, 
We'll take the early train; 
And when the watermelon's ripe, 
We'll visit you again. 
So keep us in your memory, 
This maiden and this youth, 
Uncle Abe and sister Ruth.

STELS, with great success. 
We're full of joy and glee to-day, 
And as frisky as a 
mule; 
We heard the bell—now don't you tell— 
We ran away from school. 
Our A B 
C's we know with ease, 
And c-a-t 
spells cat; 
We are so stout we waddle about, 
And we're taking Anti-Fat. 
Cnottus: 
We float around like big balloons, 
But yet we never will complain; 
We dance and sing, and then we swing 
All day in the shady lane. 
The neighbors all do loudly bawl 
When we climb their fences no matter how tall; 
And down the apples and peaches do fall, 
When into their orchards we make a 
call. 
We never study so very hard, 
For a 
dunce we'd rather be; 
And on a 
stool we stand in school— 
No books for him and 
'We are too fat to learn to spill, 
We never will be wise; 
We 
sit all day in the sun and play 
At baking and making mud pies.

"Ever thine own Sam." 
I'm very absentminded, of course it's want of thought, 
But somehow I 
can always do things wrong; 
I 
make such sad mistakes, that my heart it nearly breaks, 
And don't think that I 
shall live so very long; 
A 
girl the other day fell o'er a 
heap of clay, 
And to render some assistance I 
did stop; 
But I 
left the girl for dead, and picked up some clay instead 
And with care I 
took it to a 
doctor's shop. 
Gliorus—Do pity me, my sorrows you can see, 
To do the thing that's right I 
feel inclined; 
But I'm very often fixed that I 
get my senses mixed 
Because I've such a 
very absent mind. 
A 
lady in a 
train, placed a 
baby on my knees. 
It flurried me a 
bit beyond a 
doubt; 
The smoke from my cigar made the little baby sneeze, 
So through the window meant to throw it out; 
I 
was trying to be so kind, but still my absent mind, 
It very nearly drove me off my head; 
thought 'twas my cigar, but a 
scream from baby's ma, 
Showed me that I 
had slung the baby out instead. 
I'm quite as bad at home, once it was my wife's desire, 
That I 
would take the kettle from the hob; 
Fill it full of water, and place it on the fire, 
But of course I 
made a 
muddle of the job: 
When I 
brought the kettle back, altho' with soot 'twas black 
I 
placed it on the chair where I 
reposed; 
Still my absence did aspire, I 
placed myself upon the fire 
And I 
toasted something else beside my clothes. 
I've a 
dog, a 
very large one, which many people dread, 
We'd both been out, 'twas raining very hard; 
I 
was so absentminded, I 
placed the dog in bed, 
And myself I 
went and chained up in the yard; 
Things appeared all right, I 
lay there all the night, 
It rained, besides the night was very dark; 
I 
lay just like a 
dog, I 
thought I 
was a 
dog, 
&lid I 
never knew until I 
tried to bark.

BREACH OF PROMISE CASE. 
Sang by NF,D BARRY with great success at HARRIGAN & HART'S 
Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
Once I 
loved Matilda llinking, 
Once Matilda she -loved me; 
Once we billed and cooed like winking, 
Once engaged to wed were we; 
Now all things are altered sadly, 
Our engagement's all "U. P.; 
Matilda served me, oh! so badly, 
Silly old Cupid's up a 
tree. 
SPOKEN.—And I'm up a 
tree, too, for she who might 
have been my spouse, has made me pay for my broken 
vows, although— 
CHORUS: 
Once she loved me to distraction, 
Once she was beloved by me; 
Now she's gone and brought an action, 
Against her lover that used to be. 
Tilly in a 
shocking fashion, 
Flirted hard with ev'ry swell; 
Filling me with rage and passion, 
So one day I 
said " Farewell!" 
This, of course, raised Tilly's ire, 
Oh! you should have seen her face, 
Nothing at all would satisfy her, 
But a 
Breach of Promise Case. 
SPOKEN.—She said I 
had basely deserted her, but no' 
she would not be trampled upon with impunity, (as if 
wanted to trample on her with anything at all). 
She had 
three hundred and forty-nine love letters of mine, and 
damages she would have. 
Oh ! the inconsistency of woman. 
She said she was injured and yet she wanted further dam-
ages. 
She hated the sight of me, although— 
(Chorus), 
Si 
BREACH OF PROMISE CASE.—CONTINUED. 
The case was tried, the Court was quite full, 
Everybody was there to see; 
They seemed to think the fun delightful, 
Sport to them was death to me; 
Tilly's lawyer to the jury, 
Bullied me beyond all bounds; 
The verdict was, oh! rage and fury, 
Damages, just one thousand Pounds. 
SPOREN.—Oh, only a 
thousand; that's all. 
I 
could for-
get that, and forgive Tilly, but never can I 
forgive that 
odious lawyer of hers, Jawkins, Q. C. 
Not content with 
calling me villain, forger, burglar, assassin and other mild 
epithets, he added injury to insult by reading my letters to 
the jury. 
This is one of them: 
My own Angelic Darling: 
I 
cannot retire to my lonely couch without once more 
pouring out to you the devotion of this heart that beats for 
thee, and thee alone, my beautiful, my own. 
Oh! what a 
paradise was ours as we stood upon the doorstep this 
evening, oblivious of all save love. 
No! No! I 
cannot re-
tire to my lonely couch. I 
will watch o'er thee; the door-
step on which we stood shall be my couch, the scraper 
pressed by your seraphic boot, shall be my pillow. 
Sleep 
on! 
He read that, and everybody laughed. 
Oh! I 
could 
smother him! I 
was so upset, that when the Judge asked 
me a 
question, I replied- (Chorus). 
Now I'm in a 
pretty pickle, 
With the cash I've had to pay; 
My Matilda false and fickle, 
Weds another man to- day; 
So ev'ry swain whom Cupid fetters, 
My advice should take I 
think; 
And always write their spooney letters, 
In Anti-Breach of Promise Ink. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, gentlemen! 
Whenever you write love 
letters, always be careful to use the Anti-Breach of Prom-
ise Ink, which fades away in a 
week or two after it is 
written. 
If you do this, you will never have occasion to 
say with me— (Chorus). 
Written and composed by HARRY WhALING,Vocal Comedian and 
Author at TONY PASTOR'S TIIEATRE. 
You chaps that's been toiling and slaving all day, 
For a 
moment or two lend an ear; 
And gaze on a " Tramp" that's jolly hard up, 
And has not worked for many a 
year ; 
All sorts of games in this world I 
have tried, 
To get rich, you will please understand ; 
I've sold soap for pills, and salve to cure corns, 
And I 
once led a 
temperance band. 
aorus—Then please not to smile, but list to my tale, 
With sorrow I'll pierce your hearts through ; 
Then assist if you can a 
poor tramp out of work; 
And doesn't want any to do. 
I've beat the big drum outside of a 
show, 
I 
next faiked the thimble and pea; 
But for that I 
got nailed, and got three months in jail, 
And of course that didn't suit me; 
I 
next stole a 
child, which I 
hugged in my arms. 
And for charity knocked at each door; 
And to soften their hearts I'd stick pins in the kid, 
Which made the dear baby to roar. 
Chortid. 
I 
soon found it. out that game wouldn't pay, 
For the child could eat more than I 
got; 
So I 
turned it up and resolved on a 
plan, 
And blind beggar I 
tried like a 
shot; 
With a 
poodle and string and a 
card on my breast, 
Round every street I 
would jog; 
But because I'd no license a 
policeman came up, 
And quietly walked off with my dog. 
Chorus. 
It's time to be going, I'm getting quite dry, 
And I 
haven't got price of a 
gill; 
So you that have got any " coin " to spare, 
Please bestow it upon Lazy Bill; 
There's an old woman coming I'll see if she'll give 
To a 
cripple that's bad with the cramp; 
A coin for my lodgings, I 
mean for a 
drink, 
For the workhouse just suits this old tramp. 
Chorus, 
Nancy Green.

Pretty little Nancy will you love me ? 
For you know I

I 
will love you in the morning and the evening, 
If you will only wed me, Nancy Green. 
'Twas in among the sweet grape vine 
Where first I 
met Miss Nance, 
The little birds sang sweetly, 
My heart was in a 
trance. 
I 
asked her for to marry me, 
She did not answer no, 
And on next Sunday afternoon 
We both to the church will go.

Written by LUKE SCHOOLCRAFT, and sung with great success at 
HARRY MINER'S THEATRE. 
Ten little Niggers sat on a 
bottle of wine, 
One got killed and then there was nine; 
Nine little Coons looking for a 
date, 
One catched on, and then there was eight; 
Eight little Niggers trying to go to Heaven, 
One had a 
ticket, and then there was seven; 
Seven little Niggers playing with bricks, 
One got stabbed, and it just left six; 
Six little Niggers robbing a 
bee hive, 
One got stung to death, and left only five. 
Five little Niggers hanging on a 
door, 
One fell off, and left only four; 
Four litile Niggers standing on a 
tree, 
One fell off, and left only three; 
Three little Niggers tried to kill a 
Jew, 
One got arrested and left only two. 
Two little Niggers sleeping in a 
gun, 
One got shot, and then there was one; 
One little Nigger sat eating pie, 
The whole ten are living, it's only a 
lie.

There's sixteen dacent families 
In the house where I 
reside; 
On summer nights to cheer ourselves, 
All pleasures we have tried; 
But on the roof it's best of all, 
To hear us would be proof; 
We make the neighborhood resound, 
All singing on the roof. 
Singing on the roof, the boys and girls together, 
We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo; 
The -Murphys and O'Neils come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms; 
With pleasant conversation then, 
Sure every one she charms; 
There's Rosy Dunn and Reiley's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud they join the crowd, 
An singing on the roof. ( Chorus). 
Young Roger Flynn got up to dance, 
With a 
lady from next door; 
"Come welt the tin," says Roger Flynn, 
" 
It's like a 
ball-room floor;" 
Then one by one they joined the fun, 
Sure, none could hold aloof, 
It was a 
sight that summer night, 
To see them on the roof. ( Chorus), 
Now that's the place to spend the night, 
And feel that pleasant breeze; 
Take up your pipe and stretch yourself, 
In an attitude of ease; 
The boys and girls will gather round, 
And till the air with glee; 
When singing on the roof at night, 
As happy as can be. ( Chorus),

Singing all the day, 
Lilian, my love; 
Ever blithe and gay, 
Pure as any dove; 
From my native isle, 
Far across the sea; 
I've wandered all the while, 
Soon I'll be with thee. 
Lily waits for me, 
Sweet wild flower, 
In her bower, 
That o'erlooks the sea. 
I 
will see thee, Lily, 
When the dew-drops shine, 
'Midst the flowered vine; 
I'll be with thee, Lilian, 
When day cloth break 
-Upon the lake, 
And on the shore, 
'Midst grasses green; 
I'll meet my love, 
3Iy Emerald Queen. 
O'er the ocean spray, 
Lilian, my love; 
Swiftly all the way, 
Guided from above; 
my dear old home, 
I've come back again, 
Never more to roam, 
o'er this vast domain. 
Then with Lily, dear, 
Cheeks so rosy, 
Sitting -
cosy, 
Breathing perfumed air. 
I 
would wed thee, Lily, 
Will you be my wife? 
Through joy and strife 
I'll protect thee, Lilian; 
She whispered low, 
"I love you so."

Of silvery sheen, 
I 
wedded my

LESLIE, the only Neat Irish Dancing 
and Singing Artists in America, who never fail to please. 
In a 
distant sunny land that's far away, 
'Tis Erin's lovely isle; 
There lives the fairest maiden in the land, 
And did our hearts beguile; 
Sauey sparkling eyes Apf sapphire hue, 
Their glances on us fell; 
We could no longer stand their thrall, 
So my pretty Irish Queen, farewell! 
Her ways are so enticing, 
That tongue can never tell; 
One-half the love is fascination, 
So my pretty Irish Queen, farewell. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, yes, I 
thought I 
won her heart, 
And from me I 
thought she ne'er would part. 
Saucy sparkling eyes of sapphire hue, 
They completed just the spell; 
Our hearts were aching when we sailed, 
My pretty Irish Queen, farewell. 
If you chance to roam across the sea, 
To view that Emerald land; 
And you should chance to meet a 
lovely lass, 
So beautiful and bland; 
Do not listen to her silvery voice, 
it weaves a 
dangerous spell; 
But close your ears to her and say, 
My pretty Irish Queen, farewell. 
Her ways are so enticing, 
That tongue can never tell; 
One-half her love is fascination, 
So my pretty Irish Queen, farewell. (Chorus). 
As sung by JAMES JOHNSON in the sketch. " Sunny South," at SAN 
FRANCISCO M INSTRELS. 
You will miss me, darling Chloe, when I 
sleep beneath the 
sod, 
When the Summer winds are murmuring o'er the lea; 
You will think of me in kindness as life's weary road you 
plod, 
When my spirit rests from pain and sorrows free. 
For the sands of life are slowly ebbing, darling, with the 
tide, 
And soon these bones will mingle with the clay; 
In the winter of your sorrow you will think of how I 
died, 
And you'll miss me, Chloe, when I 
am laid away.

Old master calls, he can no longer stay; 
his limbs are getting weary and his eyes are growing dim, 
But you'll miss me, Chloe, when I 
am laid away. 
You must tell our little children that their father dwells 
above, 
With the angels now he walks the golden stai.e; 
You must tell th2m how I 
kissed them with a 
fond and 
sacred love, 
They muq, try and meet their poor old father there. 
And when the Judge his trumpet sounds from realms of 
bliss on high, 
And the mlrning of the great day comes at last, 
I 
will meet you, darling Chloe, and together you and I 
Will no longer dread December's Wint'ry blast.

James Gordon Bennett's Carpet Bag. 
Written in' d 
sung by America's Favorite Motto and Comic Vocalist, 
CHARLES H. DUNCAN. 
I'll sing you a 
ditty that I'm sure you'll say is witty, 
And before I'm done will cause you all to laugh. 
'Tis of a 
man of some renown, and a 
native of this town, 
Connected with an editorial staff. 
He went abroad, ' tis said, some damsel fair to wed, 
Whose Christian name, ' tis whispered round, was Mag. 
When he sailed for Liverpool, across the briny pool, 
In his left hand he held a 
carpet bag. 
I 
know ' twill be a 
task, an unpleasant thing to ask 
Your ears, but pray don't let your spirits flag, 
And I'll endeavor to explain, yes, each article will name 
I 
saw within James Gordon Bennett's bag. 
There was reports of the Brooklyn scandal, and a 
symphony 
wrote by Handel; 
Letters from the only girl he ever loved ; 
A 
pair of Harry Miner's dirty socks, wrapped in a 
note from 
" 
Sunset" Cox ; 
A package of " queer " that some young gounoff shoved; 
Elizabeth Tilton's last confession, an article on secession, 
While tied up in Dr. Mary Walker's old suspenders 
Was a 
document rather suspicious, looking old and quite 
judicious, 
Containing accounts of Senator Conkling's secret benders; 
Then a 
poem by deacon Smith, without either rhyme or pith; 
A new-fangled way to play the game of tag; 
A 
picture of President Hayes lacing Victoria Woodhull's stays, 
I 
saw within James Gordon Bennett's bag. 
There was the long lost Charlie Ross with Jack Aberle on a 
hoss, 
Making love to Tennie Claflin on the sly; 
Old Ben Butler on a 
stump Potter's committee trying to pump, 
Senator Thurman he was chanting " Root hog or die." 
Owney Geoghan he was caught doing things he hadn't ought, 
Billy Sexton with a 
broken billiard cue. 
He was stirring a 
pot of soup for a 
girl who had the croup, 
-Who rejoices in the name of Duck- foot Sue; 
Muldoon the solid man he had joined a 
Scottish clan, 
Little Mack was holding Bonnet's bobtail nag; 
But what caused by brain to whirl was Pastor's Coney Island 
girl, 
Dancing the can-can in James Gordon Bennett's bag.

JAMES O'NEIL'S PARODY ON 
Grandmother's Chair. 
Revised and sung by JAMES O'NEIL 8: JOHN CONROY, in all the 
leading Variety Theatres in the United States. 
My Grandfather he, at the age of 1,000 and 3, 
lie worked upon a, farm catching bees; 
It was him discovered pie, and he had a 
leather eye, 
And his necktie was a 
boarding house for fleas; 
His lungs was made of wood, and he never was any 
good, 
He could walk upon the water and never sink; 
His nose was very long, and his breath was very strong, 
He'd chew up porous plasters, soap and ink. 
CHORUS: 
But now he has departed, he bought a 
pair of wings to fly, 
Now he's painting clouds and frescoing the sky; 
He'd never refuse a 
drink, and he always had blues, 
And when he died he left Dr. Tanner his old pair of shoes. 
When he grew up to be a 
man, he had five toes upou 
each hand, 
And he married a 
girl called Arrabella Green; 
They were married just one year, and don't you think 
it queer, 
They had a 
family the finest ever seen; 
While smoking a 
clay pipe, his eldest boy named Mike, 
Was playing with a 
puzzle made of blocks; 
When seven million dollars and 3,000 paper collars, 
Fell out of my Grandfather's socks. 
(Chorus). 
He was never known to eat, he had 14 set of teeth, 
And he never wore pants in all his life; 
He was crossed in his thumbs, he had whiskers on his 
gums, 
And with ice cream he tried to choke his wife; 
One day he pawned his eye for to buy some rock and rye, 
lie got wrestling with a 
brick and broke his head; 
lie slept upon a 
box, he never changed his socks, 
And now I'm told the poor old man is dead. 
(Chorus).

ORANGE NELL. 
Written and sung by JOHN W ALSH with great success. 
I'm a 
Nobleman's daughter, och, faith, what's the matter, 
Ye needn't be laughing, ' tis truth that I 
tell; 
I 
was born in Galway, I 
trade in a 
small way, 
The finest of oranges I 
have to sell; 
Don't think that I'm joking, or fun at you poking, 
'Tis truth, every word, och, bad seran to the lie; 
Ye may well believe me, I 
wouldn't deceive ye, 
Although I 
sell oranges, arrah, who'll buy? 
CHORUS: 
They're cheap at the money, sweet, too, as honey, 
As moist as the maiden, and thin-skinned as well; 
For fever and ague, or if thirst should plague you, 
The cure's in the basket of old Orange Nell. 
My dad's name was Ryan, my mother's O'Brien, 
Their relations were Kings at the time of the Flood; 
If you look in my face, here, you plainly can trace here, 
The remnants of real, royal, red Irish blood; 
None could be purer, although I 
am poorer, 
Than they used to be, still my pride it is high; 
For the toss of my head, sure, will show I'm well bred, sure 
Although I 
sell oranges, arrah, who'll buy? 
Though I'm proud as Old Harry, I'm wanting to marry, 
Is there ever a 
boy here of high pedigre? 
With a 
pretty long stocking, be dad, I'm not mocking, 
If there is, here's my hand and my heart is quite free; 
lie must be an O'Grady, Mulroony or Brady, 
Six feet without brogues on, and not at all shy; 
Well fit for his duty, or I'll spoil his beauty, 
And make him cry oranges, arrah, who'll buy? 
Written by BEN COLLENS, and respectfully dedicated to AL. W. 
FILSON,

I'm the prince of gay young fellows, 
Who possesses enormous wealth, 
And for those who do not know me 
I 
will introduce myself. 
I'm the favorite of the ladies, 
Refined and quite high-toned, 
My name I 
hope you will excuse 
For reasons of my own. 
.SPOKEN—Yes, ladies, and gentlemen, I 
would like to tell 
you my name, but you see it might cause a 
slight misunder-
standing between several lady friends of mine. 
Oh, nothing 
wrong, I 
can assure you, I 
would tell you my name this even-
ing, but you see I 
couldn't, because it's— 
CHORUS. 
A 
private affair of my own, 
It's a 
private affair of my own, 
And it would not be right to tell you to-night, 
For it's a 
private affair of my own. 
Last evening at a 
party 
In the surburbs of this town, 
My heart was really smitten 
By a 
pair of eyes so brown; 
PRIVATE AFFAIR OF MY OWN. 
Continued. 
Her voice it quite bewitched me, 
When I 
heard her play and sing, 
Then a 
handkerchief flirtation, and— 
Oh well, all that sort of thing. 
SroKsN—Yes, I 
met the dear creature at the party, was 
introduved to her, & c., &c., and we became busily engaged in 
an earnest conversation. 
I 
made the proposal, she accepted 
—poor thing. 
I 
then called for some ice cream, soda water, 
and one thing and another. 
She then proposed a 
ride; it was 
agreeable, so I 
called a 
carriage. 
We got in, and we were 
driven to—well I 
would like to tell you where the carriage 
did take us, but I 
couldn't because— 
It's a 
private affair, &c. 
Well, we reached our destination, 
And we hastened to alight, 
But the ice cream and the soda 
Had affected my eye-sight. 
We called for more beer and oysters, 
Oh, you have all been there before, 
If not you can easily find the place 
By the number above the door. 
SPOKEN—Yes, we had just got comfortably seated when, 
on looking up, I 
beheld my astonished wife standing before 
me, whom I 
had left home three hours before. 
She uttered a 
piercing shriek, and throwing her arms aloft she exclaimed, 
"Sir, what does this mean, that beer, those oysters, that 
woman; explain yourself, sir, explain !" 
I 
arose with rather 
an unruffled expression upon my countenance and another 
upon my shirt-collar, and I 
said, " My dear, (
hie) can't you 
(hic) see, it's nothing ( hic)but— 
A 
private affair, &c.

(C1wrus.) 
ONE day, while musing quietly, 
Not knowing what to do, 
Our thoughts did wander back again 
To times of long ago; 
When father appeared just like a 
boy, 
Would caper around and prance 
To the banjo's sweetest melodies 
In merry song and dance. 
CHORUS. 
Music is so very sweet, 
It always makes us move our feet. 
Oh, don't we love this dancing! 
It fills our hearts with joy; 
'We caught it from our good old dad 
When we were little boys. 
(Sym.) 
(SYm-) 
The longer that we live 
We learn some new things good or bad; 
We always took the new things in 
We learnt from our old dad. 
This style of dancing now is new, 
Not like those days gone by, 
So watch us, and you soon will see 
How we make these old shoes fly. 
Music ;s 
so very sweet, etc.

CHAS. GILDAY'S Latest Specialty. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by A. 
J. 
FISHER, 24 Vesey St., N. Y.: 
To the opera I 
went one night, 
And " Martha" was the play, 
The music was enchanting, 
And the scene was bright and gay. 
Jewels sparkled on fair forms 
And eyes sparkled as bright, 
And oh, I 
was transported with 
The gorgeus brilliant sight. 
My heart beat fast, my cheeks glow'd red, 
My eyes they danced with light, 
Just like two round and shining stb.es 
Lit on the brow of night. 
I 
raised my glass to look around 
To see what I 
could see, 
And found that every opera glass 
-Was levelled right at rae. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, smile3 and blushes, music sweet, and jewels rich and 
rare, 
And waving fans, in many all fashion beauty there, 
My eager eyes drank in the sight as far as I 
could sec, 
But every other eye was bent admiringly on me. 
I 
turned my head to look awhile 
And gaze upon the stage, 
I 
knew my hair and dainty hat 
Would soon be all the rage. 
I 
heard a 
long drawn tender sigh, 
The house was then quite still, 
And turned to meet a 
pair of eyes 
That made my bosom thrill. 
A 
lady was discoursing her most charming occupation 
And as I 
gazed and listened 
I 
forgot my own sensation, 
For those eyes and sighs in t'other box 
Seemed with music to combine 
As the lady's song her lover's heart 
With the thread she did entwine. 
(Chorus.) 
Settle Dat Bill. 
As sung with great success by Tom SEARLES. 
Oh my ears am bendin' forward, 
For to listen to the horn 
Of Uncle Gabriel, Uncle Gabriel, 
And we'll all take a 
journey 
Just as sure as you am born. 
Uncle Gabriel, Uncle Gabriel, 
Kase when dat horn am sounded, 
Its tones will be so shrill, 
'Tis den dat day of reckon will come, 
Den you better for to settle dat bill. 
CHORUS. 
Den you better for to settle dat bill, 
I 
tell you dar's gwine to be trouble, 
Den you needn't climb high on a 
hickory tree, 
But you better for to settle dat bill. 
'Tis den you wicked sinners 
Will all be a 
crying, 
Uncle Gabriel, Uncle Gabriel, 
(Sym.) 
Den you'll all be scared to death and dyin', 
Uncle Gabriel, Uncle Gabriel. 
Kase de last time you got trusted, 
'Twas for a 
drink of rye, 
You swore afore God dat you hadn't got a 
cent 
'Twas den you told a 
lie. 
Den you better, &c.

My Mother-In-law, 
sung with great success by HARRY McAvov at the London Theatre 
New York, in the sketch of " Jealousy or Two Can Play at that 
Game," and in all the principal theatres in America. 
if you'll listen while I 
will sing you a 
ditty— 
It's about the worst woman that ever you saw, 
And when you have heard it you'll say it's a 
pity 
That ever I 
had such a 
mother-in-law. 
Whatever I 
do she is always fault finding, 
Wherever I 
goshe is sure to be there, 
And if I 
don't do why just as she asks me, 
She will help herself to a 
lock of my hair. 
CHORUS. 
My life is all troubles, I 
cannot live happy, 
If I 
open my mouth she will shove in her jaw, 
I'd rather be sent to jail or to congress 
Than to live aJ my life with my mother-in-law. 
Now she is so ugly she frightens the children 
Whenever she happens to go out in the street, 
She's a" hole in hei mouth like a 
crack in a 
pumpkin, 
A hump on her back—I'll never mention her feet, 
And she's got a 
notion that she is good-looking, 
Though her face is the worst one that ever was seen, 
And when she sits down to have her picture taken, 
The very first squint she breaks the machine. 
My life is, &c. 
Now I 
told her one day when I 
married her daughter, 
That I 
did not intend the whole family to wed, 
When she quick helped herself to a 
bucket of water 
And taking good aim let it fly at my head. 
Now I've heard that they had some good shooting at 
Creedmoor, 
And the shots were so close they were all but a 
draw, 
But I'd give ten dollars to any good shooter, 
That could rid me at once of my mother-in-law. 
My 
life is, &c. 
KISS ME AGAIN,

Prince St., N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
have a 
darling whom I 
adore, 
When he is near I 
am sighing no more; 
Lone are the hours when we are apart, 
Fondly his image now dwells in my heart. 
Sweet hours of gladness we pass side by side, 
Waiting the day when I'll be his bride; 
Dearly he loves me, but never in vain, 
Soon he is coming to kiss me again. 
Kiss me again and say that you love me, 
Ever my darling remain; 
Kiss me again, and if I 
complain, 
Say that you love me and kiss me again. 
Sweet is the kiss that lovers can share, 
How it will cheer you and banish all cam; 
Never refuse one, never be shy; 
• Don't be too bashful and scream out " Oh, my!" 
Kisses are plenty and kisses are sweet, 
When you take one the dose you'll repeat; 
If with your lov'd one you'd always remain, 
Come to his side and say, " kiss me again!" 
Kiss me again, etc. 
Sons of Erin's Isle. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FtsmaR, 187g. 
We've heard marshal songs and songs of the sea; 
Love songs and comic songs, but they don't suit me. 
We love to sing of Ireland—sweet land of our birth.... 
I'm Paddy, her son, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh Erin, my country, it grieves us to see 
Our enemies prosper, and yet we are not free. 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the sons of Erin's Isle ! 
Hurrah for the daughters, who on us do smile I 
A 
fig for her foes, where- ever they may be; 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Then arise, sons of Erin, and prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled. 
Be united like brothers, and join hand in hand, 
Then you'll drive the proud Saxon from off of our land. 
Sure the land is the people's, and who dare to dispute 
The word of our maker—for he spoke the truth. 
Then desend from the hill, and arise from the glen, 
And once more the battle of freedom begin.

DANCING ALL THE TIME. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by SAUL SERTREW. 
I'm light as a 
cork, I'm happy and gay; 
On the heel-tap I 
come, just to pass time away. 
Oh, I'm happy-go-lucky, all day, you see, 
The merriest darkey that ever could be. 
I 
charm all the fair sex, I 
make their beaux frown; 
My heel makes the music just where it comes down. 
Oh, 
feel like a 
grasshopper, nimble and gay, 
knd dancing just carries this darkey's way. 
CHORUS. 
Dancing all the time! 
Dancing all the time! 
On the light fantastic toe, I'm dancing all the time. 
Dancing all the time! 
Dancing all the time! 
Trouble never troubles me, I'm dancing all the time. 
(Dance.) 
Old trouble may come, I'll let him alone; 
He's a 
bad friend, I'm sure, for a 
fellow to own; 
Oh, the twist of the grape-vine is just my style, 
It makes a 
man happy most all the while. 
'Way down in the ball-room I 
make the folks stare, 
For fun and for frolic, you'll find I 
am there. 
So wherever I 
go, if there's fun to be found, 
If you keep your eye open, you'll find me around.

The Dear Olcl Flag of Green. 
Written for PADDY and ELLA MURPHY by BARNEY FAGAN. 
How proudly floats forth our noble flag of green— 
That emblem of purity—in solitude serene. 
With rapture and delight the Irish bosoms heave; 
To earth its oppressors our martyrs yet will cleave 
No taint of dishonor at that banner ever hurled, 
Since first its proud foulds to the breeze were unfurled. 
May the bright suns of heaven cast their beams on tha' 
spot, 
And let a 
day of freedom be the Irishmen's lot, 
CHORUS. 
Then let your shouts re-echo, far, far across the sea, 
All loyal sons stand ready to see that isle set free ; 
Quickly swell your ranks, and let your war cry be: 
Death to the tyrants; on, on to victory! 
With pride we can look on the noble deeds and fame 
Of Irelands trusty warriors—immortal be their names. 
Foremost in the strife amid the shot and shell, 
The glorious din of battle- cry our patriots help to swell 
Their praises resound throughout our noble land, 
On every battle field their deeds of bravery stand, 
With courage true as steel and eager for the fray, 
Right manfully they strive, to help gain the day. 
All honor to the heroes now lying 'neath the clay, 
The memory of their valiant deeds never shall decay. 
Unfurl to the breeze the flag they love so dear, 
Proclaim to its foes they'll yet have cause to fear. 
Loud above the din of the roaring cannon's peel, 
The steady tread of cavalry, the clanging of the steel, 
Will be heard the cry of victory, as it resounds from 
shore to shore, 
Old Ireland's sons will wake to find their bondage chains 
no more. 
Then let your shouts, Ste.

You may think that / am mad, but I 
only do f
eel 
sad, 
And the reason I 
will tell you every 
one; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, and 
her 
name 
was Peggy Doyl
e, 
And I 
took her to Coney Isle to have 
some f
un. 
She is from the County Down, and she wei
ghs 200 lbs., 
And I 
thought she would be true to me all th e 
w hile; 
But if I 
had it to do again, she would never 
go 
t
o 
Swim along with me again to Coney Isl
e. 
CHORUS 
She had salt water there galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile, 
Sure they all did wave thei r hat
s, 
And shouted float her Pat, 
The day I 
took my Peg to Coney Isl
e. 
Now its when we reahed the pi er, 
we 
went 
and had 
some 
beer, 
And after that we went to have a bath e. 
You may talk about the f
at 
woman that 
t
ravel
s w i
th 
Bar-
num's show, 
But you'd ought to see myPeg upon the waves. 
The gang began to guy us, my bosom 
was 
on 
fi re, 
And sonic ot them gave me a 
grand 
hurrah ! 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth 
Be heavens shouted out, the re's one 
of 
the 
lions 
That escaped the other day. 
Ch orus. 
Now of course I 
did feel mad aft er 
li st
eni
ng t
o 
th at l
ad, 
And I 
know he thought himself quite smart, 
But if I 
had him in New York, up 
near 
the- 
Central 
Park, 
You can bet that I 
would break 
hi s heart. 
I 
don't say I'm a 
fight er, 
a 
cutt er 
or 
a 
bi ter, 
But I 
always take my 
own part 
all the 
w hil e; 
Arndt mushal bad luck to Peg, 
May she lose one of • ht legs, 
Before I 
take her again to Coney Island.

Took My Peg to Coney Isle.

Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called EITIMPTY DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear. 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at,home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
