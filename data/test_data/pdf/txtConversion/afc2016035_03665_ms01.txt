Corrine Case interviewed by Paul Vance and Barrie Cline 
Does it, it doesn't turn green? 
It doesn't turn green. 
Understood. 
Crazy. 
Completely understood, what do you want me to do? 
Just sign there, initial. 
I guess I want to be recorded. 
Surprise [Corinne 00:00:17], we're recording you. 
I hate Law and Order. Can they take up any more parking spots? 
Oh is that what was so- 
Yeah. 
[00:00:30] It was a film shoot? They love- and then they don't even use half the spots 
half the time. 
I know. 
It's pretty frustrating. This neighborhood ... All right. So what's today's date? The 
second? February 2nd. 
Tomorrow's my birthday. 
Exciting. How old are you going be? 
41.

Oh, my gosh. All right, let's start with the first question. [00:01:00] Let's start with please 
tell me your name and your job title and where do you live? 
My name is Corinne Case. I live in Ridgewood, Queens, and my job title is, I'm a 
journeyman. Electrician, journeyman. 
Is there a specific, like there's apprentice- 
I'm a journeyman. 
You're a journeyman. 
Journeyman electrician. 
[00:01:30] Okay, perfect. Did you grow up in Ridgewood, Queens? 
I did not, I grew up in Cutchogue on Long Island, New York. 
Cutchogue. 
Suffolk County. 
Is that where your parents are from? 
Yes, from the same town. It's not really the same village but the town of Southold and 
the town of Riverhead, which are two Suffolk County towns. Both my parents and my 
father's family's been there since, believe it or not, since the late 1700s, [00:02:00] my 
father's family's been on Long Island. 
Wow. 
Yeah, I'm pretty well-versed on my father's side of the family, not as much on my 
mother's side. 
Do they still live there? 
Yes. 
That's crazy, and you're super close with your family? 
Yes. 
Like crazy close. Are any of them electricians or in the construction trade? 
Yes, my father actually died when I was four years old from a construction accident. 
No [00:02:30] way.

Believe it or not, somehow I ended up like what do you want to do, do you want to be? 
"I want to work in construction," and both of my brothers are both carpenters. Some of 
my cousins are carpenters. I have a cousin that was an electrician in Local 3 but he 
moved to Maine. Now he works up there. 
Asa Local Three electrician? 
No, as an electrician but I don't think he's- 
In a local? 
Yeah. He's not working for anyone. 
Do you have any hobbies, Corrine? 
[00:03:00] Not really. My hobbies pretty much are: I hang out with my family. I used to 
be into artwork, not as much anymore. I think my life now, where I am at now, is ... I just 
kind of like to go on vacation. I think that's my hobby. 
Where are you going on vacation these days? 
I just bought a condo in Puerto Rico. I love it so much. 
Oh, my gosh. [00:03:30] Congratulations. 
That's my goal right now, is to be a professional vacationer. 
Okay. 
We bought a vacation property to rent it out in order to go on more vacations. 
Does your job allow for more vacations? 
My job financially it allows me to go on vacation. Time-wise, I take what I can get if we 
have furlough, which we have [00:04:00] eight weeks of furlough. Fortunately, this year 
I'm pregnant, so I don't get to use my time for vacation. I have to use it for baby time, 
but last year, yeah. I'm sorry. Furlough's really, it's hard, because we'd only get two 
weeks' vacation if we didn't have furlough. Last year we didn't have furlough, so I took 
the two weeks and I took a couple more weeks that I just didn't get paid for. 
But you were financially fine with being- 
I was financially stable to be able to do that. Because [00:04:30] we didn't have furlo ugh 
last year, I worked a lot and I saved money and hence the condo and the baby. That was 
unplanned, the baby's not planned. 
The baby's not planned?

Oh, my gosh, that must have a- 
Would you mind explaining what furlough is? I don't think everyone knows... 
Furlough is a type of work share program that Local 3 does. What they do is, if there's 
too many people, we call it 'being on the bench' when people are out of work. If there's 
too many people on the bench, [00:05:00] they do it by percentage of A-rate employees 
and amount of time that they're out. They have an equation, a special equation that 
they use every year. If the rate becomes too high and the wait is too long, they begin a 
furlough process and we can have either 8,10, 12, or 14 week furloughs per year. It 
allows for people that are out of work for an extremely [00:05:30] long period of time to 
come back in. They get tickets, they call them, and they're work tickets for a certain 
amount of time. That amount of time allows them, by whatever mandates, to make sure 
they keep their, that they get their year for their pension down the road and the family's 
healthcare is not turned off and things like that. 
Basically it's a type of work share program. It's called a furlough [00:06:00] because we 
are technically laid off for whatever those times are through the state. When that time 
is up, we can go back to work. They have replacement workers which can come in. They 
can come in for up to 26 weeks or more and they get to make sure that they don't turn 
off any of their benefits. They get their benefits after. 
Okay, thank you. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative) 
Your division is journeyman, right? 
I'm in the A division. 
Journeywoman. 
I prefer journeyman, [00:06:30] but whatever. 
You do? 
I do. 
Why? 
I'm very weird about, I didn't come in to the field to become a female electrician, I just 
wanted to be an electrician. I'm not a, maybe I am a feminist, but I'm not the type of 
feminist where I have to have women's things. I just want equality, do you know what 
I'm saying?

Umm. 
I'm good with that. Treat me like everybody else and I'm really good with it. I don't need 
special privileges. I don't need a special bathroom. I don't need a special shanty. I just 
want to be treated like everyone else. When it comes to doing things, [00:07:00] I like ... 
which is hard now, because I'm pregnant. 
I was just about to ask you? 
They won't even (inaudible) do heavy labor. I just want to be treated equal, I don't want 
them to treat me different. So far, until I got pregnant, it was very ... I think that's why I 
stayed employed was because I was like that. I wasn't, I don't want to say you have to 
be thick-skinned, because I really don't think you do. I think it's a choice that you make 
to go into an industry, right? If I was to go into the fashion industry, [00:07:30] I would 
have to know that, I mean, this sounds really snotty, but if you're going to go into the 
fashion industry, you prefer to be a smaller size, because you know that's what it is. I 
don't want to say you have to be thick-skinned to go into this, because you know when 
you go into it, what it is. We're not there to be delicate and no one's there to be, no one 
there is a psychiatrist ora psychologist. No one's going to baby you. I just [crosstalk 
00:07:57] people. 
So what is it that you do? What is it? [00:08:00] What is being an electrician? What type 
of work do you, in your division, do? 
I do commercial electrical installs, which include lighting, power, anything. Right now I'm 
working in a Starbucks. We have to put in, we had to feed transformers which fed four 
other panels and install the panels, the steel back boxes, the [dubs 00:08:23], and then 
you run pipe and wire out to every device, which is an outlet or a switch or a [00:08:30] 
coffeemaker or anything that you have to do, an air conditioner unit, and then you wire 
those units, wire receptacles for the coffeemakers. We do all the lighting, which includes 
lighting controls. That's about it. 
Have you been doing the same type of work throughout your- 
Absolutely not. I've been really fortunate to have a very [00:09:00] diverse type of work. 
I originally wanted to be a carpenter, and someone told me, "You could end up putting 
up sheet rock and you'll, will put that same sheet rock up for 20-something years and 
everyday you're just putting up sheet rock." That scared the shit out of me, and I did not 
want to do that. I've done a lot of AV work. I worked at Madison Square Garden for four 
years, and I've probably seen, I'll probably never see the types of AV installations- 
What's AV work? 
Audio Video. [00:09:30] Just all low voltage work, but they're weird wires with crimps 
and fiber optic cables and every time you land a cable into a rack, it's a different kind of 
connection into the rack. You just learn to work with what, at some point you have to 
accept that I don't know everything, absolutely. You know, it's like there's no way for

you know. That makes you more open to be able to do new things. [00:10:00] Where 
some people are like, "No, this is a Cat 5, and this is how you use it and this is how it's 
connected and every single time," but things are changing so much now that there are 
other ways. As stubborn as I am, I try to always keep an open mind and do whatever I'm 
told to do. 
So how did you go about becoming an electrician? Why was that- 
I originally wanted to work with wood. I told you I wanted to be a carpenter. 
Carpenter. 
[00:10:30] I went to a Non-traditional Employment for Women, which was a [00:10:34] 
introduction to the trades for women. I fell into it, actually. I wanted to be a carpenter, 
wanted to be a cabinetmaker, and I found out that the waiting list to become a 
cabinetmaker is a very, very long list. You have people just with a lot more experience 
than I have in cabinetry or woodworking in general [00:11:00] on those lists because 
they've been working non-union for years. They're just waiting to get in. 
Is that female and men are waiting on this list or is it- 
I've never met a female cabinetry person. 
Oh, really? 
I think it's a smaller, I don't know about now. I came in 2009. I think I came in 2009. 
To the electrical industry? 
Into, yeah, the Local 3. I had done research when [00:11:30] I was at [NEW 00:11:30] 
about different things and one of the, I did research a lot of different unions. I knew I 
wanted to be in a union, because I knew I needed the protection. I needed the benefits. 
I haven't worked without benefits my entire life. I looked into the Dock builders, and I 
don't think there were any women in the Dock builders at the time. I got scared away 
from it, honestly, because I went online and I looked at their pictures online. The guys 
were all shaped like Vs, their shoulders were double the [00:12:00] width of mine. You 
can tell it's not because they work out, do you know what I'm saying? Because they had 
beer bellies and stuff like that. It wasn't like they were going to the gym and working 
out, it was their jobs that did that. 
I was already older when I started, I think I was 33. I think I was 33 when I got accepted, 
I started looking into these things. I knew that there was no way, in 20 years at 53, as a 
woman, there are physical, women have physical [00:12:30] things that make it harder 
than for me. At 53,1 think a woman's bones are more delicate than a man's, I just do, 
that's what I think. I figured 30 years of that, I don't think I can manage.

Corrine G.: 
When I looked into Local 3, into the electrical field, the res so many different outlets, 
there's so many different things you can do. It's a choice, it's not forced upon you where 
you can put your passion. [00:13:00] There's some spots wherever you put your passion, 
and you fell in it. You could go there and you could do that and you could make your 
own path. I think that's very, very rare in this day and age, for you to go into any 
industry, not even construction, any industry, law, doctors, anything, a field will push 
you into what's needed. If passion dictates where you go, I think it's a lot healthier 
[00:13:30] and it's a lot more fun to work ... 
Can you tell me what your passion is with the work that you do? 
I really like AV work a lot. In our industry, there's not a lot of AV work. I know how to use 
the tools, the tools are very rare, some of the tools. I can crimp [00:14:00] almost any 
wire with, I can tell a crimper, what kind of wire it goes with. I like that a lot because it's 
very unique work and it's very, when you lay wires into a tray and you do it neatly, it 
looks very nice. I love doing that. 
I also like doing heavy stuff, it's a mix of things. I'll find passion in whatever job we have, 
what I like to do in it. 
What's the heavy stuff? 
Huge transformers or switch [00:14:30] gear, where you have, like, 500,000s, which are 
really heavy wires. I can't do it now because I'm pregnant, but when you have to use 
your whole body to bend a wire to make it look neat, it's less ... people thinks it's all 
totally physical, but it's not. It's a lot of pre-think, you got to think ahead where you're 
going to bend the wire. It's kind of using your brain on how to use a tool or to use a box, 
anything to get the wire to bend, where you're not [00:15:00] just using brute force, 
you're using kind of like a fulcrum, you're using something else to do it and to make it 
easier. Believe it or not, they say and I find it true, women in the industry thi nk before 
they do. With a lot of guys, they'll just do and women will think. 
Like today at work, we were going to have to pay $10,000 to have two transformers 
brought into our job. Because we're not on the elevator floor, [00:15:30] you can't, 
there's only an escalator and you can't take a transformer on an escalator. Another job, 
they were building, the MTA was putting an entrance in for an E train. There's a big 
open hole, and there's a guy up there in a forklift. There's a guy over there with a big 
digger thing, a backhoe, a backhoe. I said, "Why can't we just bring it in that hole?" 
I'm the type person that'll just go ask somebody. I'll ask the driver, "Can you, can 
[00:16:00] you grab something for us and bring it down this hole?" They actually ended 
up doing it. I was really surprised they listened to me. Sometimes I have really crazy 
ideas, and we actually ended up doing it. We saved probably $10,000 just by asking 
people to do a favor. "Can you do me a favor?" They probably had to slip somebody 
$100 here or there, but if you think about things before you do them, otherwise we 
would have been carrying 800 pound transformers down the stairs. I [00:16:30] wasn't 
getting that.

Did you get accolades for thinking of that solution or- 
I don't think so. I think it's kind of like- 
Is it a thankless job? 
No, I think the thanks that I get is that a) they allow me to work when I'm pregnant. I'm 
on light duty, which is not a necessity in our field. They don't have to put you on light 
duty, they don't have to, but if you ... That's my performance right [00:17:00] now, you 
know what I'm saying? I'm trying to do thinking things because I can't do the physical 
things. If I could, I would have carried it down the stairs. I would have been like, "There, 
it's done," but that's what I have to offer right now. Like I say, where your passion is. 
That's what I have to offer right now, I can't lift giant reels of wire or push things, and 
I'm tryingto be useful. I don't want to, as a female and pregnant, and there's not... 
Believe it or not, it's not [00:17:30] as common as one would think. We do have, I think 
our percentage is really up there now, like of women in our industry- 
What's not very common? 
People of- 
A pregna nt woma n that's working because- 
That's so funny you said that. 
I had to make phone calls to our union hall to find out how much time I get off. They're 
like, "Well, you working?" And I'm like, "Yeah, I'm working." I asked people, I asked 
other women that I knew that had babies that were electricians, and I'm like, "Well, 
what'd you do?" They're like, "I didn't go back to work," or "I left work." I'm like, "Well, 
like, I wanna continue working. [00:18:00] I like, you know, I wanna take, have some 
time off, but I wanna go right back to work with the same job that I left with." It's not 
very common. I had to go to a lot of people to find out the answers to my questions 
about time and things like that. 
How common is it for women to be on the site at all, pregnant or... 
It's pretty common, actually. I mean- 
I re- 
I forget, it's 10 percent. What is it, 9 percent? 
I remember the first [00:18:30] job we were at, we had that female worker who was 
working. She was just putting in switches and outlets and stuff like that, back in Adco. 
Blonde. We had a big sandwich party with her. 
Who was that?

No, it wasn't Karen. That's funny. 
How did you go about learning all the, since we obviously can't know everything, but 
how did you- 
I [00:19:00] thought I did, I did. Cool thing about it, I want to say your personality and 
how it helps work, is that, it's like the law of attraction. If you're attracted to people that 
are doing the right thing, you'll learn how to do the right thing without even thinking 
about it, as far as learning how to bend a pipe instead of learning how to leave 15 
minutes early. Those are all things and they're not, they're a choice like anything 
[00:19:30] else. They're a choice of who you choose to align yourself with and just how 
you choose to work, you know? What your work ethic is. 
I was old enough when I started that my ego didn't really get in the way to say, "You 
know what? I'm an apprentice and I don't know this and I want to know it. Can you 
teach me?" But I think that's also easier [00:20:00] for women, [inaudible 00:20:00]. So I 
never had a problem telling somebody, "I don't know what I'm doing, can you show me 
what to do?" And still, after they showed me, I could go to somebody else and be like, 
"Somebody show me how to do this. Can you show me how you do it?" That's very 
common in our industry. That there's not one way to do things, there's many ways to 
end up with the same result so it's who you choose to learn from. 
[00:20:30] I like things to look nice, I like them to be neat, and that's who I stuck with 
when I started learning stuff. I looked at people who tied their shoes properly. 
Ridiculous things that made a difference to me. If someone comes in in work boots and 
they don't tie them? I don't think that I want to work like them. You know? That's how I 
try to help people that are coming in now, is to say things like that. Like [00:21:00] "Tie 
your shoes and you'll get more respect." I mean, it sounds totally ridiculous, but in 
reality, it's not. It's just the way of the world. And if that's your fashion statement... 
You say that you would base who you wanted to work with or get taught by certain 
[00:21:30] certain little innuendos or whatever- 
Yeah. Characteristics. 
Did you get to pick those people or are you assigned those people? 
Listen, again, I didn't come into this at eighteen and I live a lifed and we all, whether you 
like to admit it or not, we [inaudible 00:21:46] to get what we want. However it be. 
So you were able to pick someone [crosstalk 00:21:54].

I want to say it's ... [00:22:00] I don't want to say it's a conniving thing, but it's a positive 
aspect of- did you spend anytime hanging out on the streets. You have to learn how to 
do certain things and you have to learn that your behaviors have a certain result. Maybe 
sometimes, you behave [00:22:30] a certain way to get a certain result. People can do it 
wherever, if they have to return a pair of jeans that they wore already and they want to 
do it, they'll do that. But then at work, they won't be like, "Oh, I can't do it. If you had to 
go to Macy's to return those pants you would be like, a little bit, you know?" 
Working it? 
Get your way. So, I do think that that [inaudible 00:22:49] get my way. There are certain 
things you have to give up. I was at a certain job and the people that I had to work with 
used to [00:23:00] come in an hour early. So you know what I started doing? Coming in 
an hour early and hang with them. And guess what, I got to work with them. There were 
even certain times when I was just really stubborn in probably a negative way, it still 
sticks with me. They would be like, "Oh, you're still working with this person?" Just 
every free minute, I would make a reason to go talk to the other person that I wanted to 
work with that were doing something else. 
Do you think you had to push a little bit harder as a woman? Or- 
[00:23:30] I don't think as a woman. I think as a stubborn person that wanted to get my 
way, I had to push. I think that I knew a lot of people that were pushing for the wrong 
reason [crosstalk 00:23:43]. I have a good friend, and I love her and we get along great, 
and she has a different outlook on her purpose. Where my purpose is honestly just to be 
an electrician when I go to work. That's my purpose. I [00:24:00] don't need to show 
anybody that woman are just as good, I don't care. If you treat a wife like shit, I honestly 
know people that don't treat their wives that nice. But I don't really judge them on that, 
because that's not my purpose. I'm not friends with them, I don't hang out with them on 
weekends. It's not my purpose and I'm not goingto sitthere and tell them how they're 
behaving wrong. Or how they're treating women wrong. 
My purpose is just to go to work. I [00:24:30] think that some people, I mean it sounds 
really [inaudible 00:24:32], but some women go on a job and they get that fucked up. 
And I think they are there to prove a point. That's not why you go to work. You don't go 
to work to your 9-5 to prove a point, unless you're a lawyer. If you're not a 
representative of- If you're just an electrician- If you want to go and be a steward and 
you want to do that, and you want to have a political life, that's available. But if you 
[00:25:00] just work during the day and you just want to do your job and be happy and 
go home, then you can choose just to do your job. And not have to be uncomfortable in 
situations that have nothing to do with you. 
I have women friends in the industry, they take shit so personally. Like, "Ugh, can you 
believe they said this about her?" Even the shit that goes on right now with Trump. You 
know, I have people that I work with and I enjoy their company and they voted for 
Trump and it makes me sick. It makes me want to throw up. But I don't judge them 
because that's [00:25:30] not what I'm there for.

That's not [crosstalk 00:25:38] I'm not a renegade in that way, in that manner. 
How many years have you been working as an electrician? 
Since 2009 I have been working as an electrician. 
Since 2009? 
2009. 
Nice. Was there ever a tool or a location that was a little overwhelming [00:26:00] or 
something that you might have been scared to work with? 
Definitely. I hate still hate to use a sawzall. 
Do you? 
I hate the sawzall. 
What is a sawzall? 
A sawzall is a very reciprocating saw blade that comes out of the machine gun. Like a 
handheld saw and it can bounce and it is not an exact [00:26:30] saw blade. 
Do you use it? 
Yeah, I have to. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
I try to do it very sparingly. And when I reckon I can use a different tool, I use a different 
tool. 
Yeah? 
Because I think that there's no way to- Just the bounce, you don't know where it's going 
to go. And your finger is already there. You ever see people on motorcycles and they 
lost control but they're holding on, so they're pushing the gas at the same time? 
Yeah.

That's a sawzall. That's what I do with a sawzall when it goes on. 
What about location? 
[00:27:00] Yeah, I usually got my mind changed. I've been so fortunate to work with 
people and in places; the place matters less than the people. I think it was a couple 
weekends in a row, I worked on Governors Island in the middle of the winter. It was so 
cold, we were in a ditch. 
Oh my gosh. 
We were in a ditch and the only cool thing was you could smoke [00:27:30] while you're 
working. So, I was like you know you always find the silver lining. 
You have to. 
And it was so cold, the only thing showing was my eye under my glasses. But it was 
funny because it was just so miserable. You laugh at people when they fall off the ladder 
into the dirt. Another pretty miserable location- You know, I worked with cool people. 
What made it miserable? It was just the outside? 
Conditions, [00:28:00] it's always the conditions. 
Mow'd you prepare for that? I mean, I remember waking up for a deck job and just being 
like, "Oh my gosh, what do I wear?" 
Yeah, you just do layers. And the thing there was there was no food either. That's what 
freaked me out because now they may ask you to stay an extra three hours. So I literally 
bought a grocery bag full of food with me in case. Like whole avocados, I just threw 
[00:28:30] them in there and stuff. The way to prepare is just to know who's going to be 
there and know there's at least one other person that you can commiserate with. And 
then, it'll be okay. I didn't want to go to Madison Square Garden when I first went there 
because the year before, the conditions were so horrible people were coughing up 
blood and they couldn't breathe there. A guy died on top of a duct. Just really bad. It 
was [00:29:00] really hot. But your conditions go by the wayside if you have fun a little 
bit. 
Have you ever been injured on a job? 
I hurt my back when I was a second year apprentice. 
Oh my gosh. 
I thought I was an elephant, like there was nothing that could hurt me. I used to do 
stupid shit that I wouldn't do now like take deliveries by myself of sixteen rolls of BX and 
roll a cart down a loading dock that was at an angle. I [00:29:30] would never do that

now. But I hurt my back on a twelve foot ladder putting up really heavy outdoor 
temporary lights. 
Temporary, too. 
It was like an engine block, they were so heavy. It was just to show a space [ 00:29:42]. 
Oh my gosh. 
And I used to take the attitude of, "Got to get it done." After that injury, it's more, "Get 
it done safely." That's more important to me. So I twisted wrong, it [00:30:00] didn't 
hurt that night. The next day, I couldn't walk. I tried to get in my bathtub, I had a bath 
you had to step over and I couldn't. And I had to stop school, I was out for six months, I 
had to stop working. I realized I wasn't infallible. I wasn't going to be superman. But 
then, I also realized that it was..benefits are awesome [ 00:30:24] It was such a little 
amount because I think I was [00:30:30] still getting first year pay, so I was getting 
maybe $325 week. 
How much? 
$325? 
Wow. 
Yeah. I got workers compensation and I was making 90% of my salary. I'm like, "Holy 
shit, you can get hurt at work [00:31:00] and they'll still pay you when you're not at 
work." It was a revelation to me and I would go to the doctor and they'd be like, "That's 
it. There's no copay, there's no nothing." And I was like whoa. The union was great. I 
always have a good reception when I have to do anything at the union hall. I'm very 
grateful for that. I guess I worked a long time that I didn't have any benefits. When you 
work at a fucking bar and you get hurt, you'll [00:31:30] probably never go back to there 
for work, ever. That's just the way it is. You're like, yeah remember she broke her hand, 
oh yeah, she was cool. And then they never saw you again. 
And what does it mean to you to be a union member? 
Really grateful. I'm so grateful to have some backup, it's like having backup for your life 
basically. I just bought a condo [00:32:00] and the only way I was able to afford to do 
that was because of my benefits. Because of my 401k and because I started putting 
money in a credit union and they take it out of your check automatically. Otherwise, I 
would have never saved that money. If I wasn't working on a union job, I probably 
couldn't afford to have a baby right now. There's no way I could afford to take off time, 
off work. If you worked in a restaurant, that's what I did before, I kind of did a lot of 
[00:32:30] that, you can't take time off and still get paid. So if you have a baby and you 
don't have benefits, how do you have a baby? I don't know how you do it. How do they 
afford it? I don't have to pay for my doctor's appointments. If I had to pay a $30 copay

every time I went to my baby doctor- It's crazy. It has your back to live life, do other 
things. And if I didn't have benefits, if I didn't have the health insurance that I had- 
The dental[00:32:57]. 
Yeah, and the disability. [00:33:00] All that stuff. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Do you have a favorite Local 3 tradition? 
I kind of just like fucking with people at work. We kind of always do that. One of my 
favorite things, we did it the other day, sometimes we get money from mongo[ 
00:33:23] but we'll lie to one person and say we got three times [00:33:30] as much as 
we really did. So it's a game and we laugh and whatever. 
What's mongo [00:33:34]? 
So sometimes we are doing a job and there is copper left over and they pulled it out and 
it was going to get thrown away. So, the foreman would take it in and split it between 
the job and the shop and all that stuff. They don't usually get into that, I never do it on 
my own but when they do on the job, they do it every once in a [00:34:00] while and 
that's always a fun way to mess with people. I like the camraderie of it. You get together 
and have coffee in the morning. 
I like going to rallies. You know when you see pictures of the twenties or the forties and 
you see the people who actually died for what we have? Literally died, you know what 
[00:34:30] I'm saying? Sometimes, you go to a rally and you realize wow, I'm just taking 
some time off ...docked pay or whatever but these people gave up their jobs or they 
have no food on their tables and they still went and did something they weren't getting 
paid for so that somebody else could get paid for it. I like doing that, I like feeling that 
way. When you go to a rally, you'd feel like the people that [00:35:00] did it years before 
you. Still resonates in the air like that. 
Do you have a typical day at work? 
No. 
No? 
I don't think so, not really. 
Do you enjoy that? 
Yeah, I do enjoy that. I don't have a typical day. Because each job is ... every job is 
different. 
Do you always work with the same people?

I'm working with Mike Byrd who I have worked with, known him for yea rs. Usually if I'm 
on a job with him, we end up working together because we just laugh a lot. I've worked 
with him at the Garden for a year and a half. I really stay in the same circle of people 
that are at different jobs. I [00:36:00] stayed under the same foreman for six years. 
Oh wow. 
Five years. So then, I did work with the same people for a long time. When you eat 
together with people and you- Not so much at this job, my last job in Brooklyn, we ate 
together every day. Everybody ate lunch together because there's no going out for 
lunch there because there's no place to go. [crosstalk 00:36:28] order out at the 
Brooklyn [00:36:30] Nets. 
Where? 
Industry City? We would order out sometimes and we at like a family every single day. 
And we were spending more time with those people than you do with your family. And 
you get to know them. Someone's kid is sick or whatever, it's a family. I'm very 
appreciative of that family, but then you don't really hang out them outside of [crosstalk 
00:36:53] I don't have to. I see my boyfriend for the weekend [00:37:00] sometimes. My 
other family, you know. People like my friend Dominic was getting married and he called 
me, he's like, "Do you want to go to the wedding?" I'm like, "Not really, no offense." I'm 
really honest about that, I really don't want to go to a weddingwith your family. I hang 
out with you every day. I know exactly everything that's going on in your wedding. I 
don't need to be there, you know? 
Show me pictures. 
I know, exactly. 
Over coffee, quick. 
I really appreciate that camraderie in people where we don't feel like, especially back 
with people in Brooklyn, nobody [00:37:30] felt like they had to do shit with each other 
outside of work. 
Do you take work home with you ever? 
Never. 
Never.

Do you [00:38:00] and Mike Byrd, is it just you two on the job? Or what's the size of the 
job? [crosstalk 00:38:06] 
We have a bunch of different job numbers but it's all on the same site. So, I wasn't 
always there. I was pulling fiber for a long time. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
It was with other people and I was on the fiber- There's crews. Now, I'm on the Star 
bucks and it's me, Mike, and another kid, an apprentice. And we're [00:38:30] basically 
just doingthe Starbucks. There's people downstairs doing four-inch [inaudible 00:38:33] 
crew, people downstairs that are pulling wire, the wire crew. It's a very weird thing over 
there. 
So it's like your shop and then there's the umbrella 
Probably ten or twelve local three shops on that job. 
Oh wow. 
Yeah, there's a shantytown. 
What is a shantytown? 
[00:39:00] A shanty is either a Conex box, which is like the shipping boxes. Or it's just 
like a plywood shed, sort of. Where all the guys put their coats and their backpacks. 
They change their boots, they change their clothes. That's really about it. They put those 
out usually all in one area so not an eyesore on the job. So in the basement of the 
Oculus, there is still [00:39:30] probably thirty shanties down there. 
Wow. 
Yeah. 
That's literally a town. 
It is a town. 
Do you guys have your own coffee shop down there? 
No. 
No, not yet?

Some people have coffee machines down there. We don't have one. 
Oh man. Oh, so you get to personalize them? 
Yeah. 
Interesting. Have you ever felt creative at your job? 
Yeah, definitely. 
Yeah? Can you explain? 
Yeah. So if you show that [00:40:00] you know what you're doing, someone will leave 
you alone to do your job. They won't tell you how to run a pipe, they won't tell you 
which direction to run it, put a 90 here, put a 90 degree angle in the pipe. They won't 
tell you that, they know that you can handle it and they'll just say do it. So, it sounds 
silly, but you get to run pipe runs, decide where the pipes get bent [00:40:30] and how 
they look. 
Today I was wiring up a hot water heater and you know you have the hot water heater 
in the corner and you have valves sticking out with things that you have to wire on 
them, so you get to do it how I think it looks nice. And I like that. I like doing that. I like 
the wires to be neat, I like them to do splices neat and tidy. I love doing panels, you pull 
the wires all either from the bottom or top, wherever they're coming from, and you run 
them in there. You bring [00:41:00] each one to a breaker, I like to do that a lot. I think I 
do it fairly neat. So if you do that, then they'll say, "Okay, this is how you do it." 
If you're not neat about it, they are not [inaudible 00:41:08] not going to ask you to do 
it. But they're going to be like, "I asked you to do this, I need you to do this, and I need 
you to do this." And then you're restricted. You have to be careful to put the ground 
here, neutral here, and all the hot lines[inaudible 00:41:17] or whatever. And if you 
show that you know how to do it, they'll kind of let you be creative about that. That's 
why I like to do AV work, I really like to- You bring thousands of wires into a big 
[00:41:30] rack and you use a lot of Velcro and you just make it look neat. And I like to 
do that. And then I get really mad when the final users come in and they start running 
their own wires and you just get pissed. I kind of like that part too, though, because 
we're like, "Jerks." 
Have you ever had a tool passed down to you or passed down a tool to an apprentice? 
Both ways. 
Oh, nice. 
[00:42:00] One special thing that happened is that I found a pair of Klein pliers in my 
Aunt's garage. My [inaudible 00:42:06] passed away in probably the late 80s, I found a

brand new pair of Klein pliers still in the box. They used to not come with rubber 
handles on them, they used to be just the metal pliers. 
Oh my gosh. 
You had to put your own handles on them. They had letters on the thing and I googled it 
and they were made in the fall of 1968, [00:42:30] those pliers. 
Wow. 
Brand new, still in the box. There was also a roll of electrical tape, it was the kind that 
came in a tin. It was brand new and I was so psyched to find that. I still have it. 
You still have the tape? 
Yeah, I didn't use it. I'm going to put it in a shadow box. 
Oh fun. 
And I had somebody give me, my friend gave me, the handles that go with it. A lot of 
people used to have these maroon dipped handles. 
Who gave them to you? 
[00:43:00] A guy [inaudible 00:42:59] at my job. I brought the pliers in and showed 
everyone at work. So he said, "Listen, these are for your pliers." So I'm going to put 
them in the shadow box as well. The dipped handles. Because you don't need to buy the 
dipped handles anymore because usually the handles don't fall off your pliers anymore. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
And then [inaudible 00:43:16] When somebody give you tools like that, I kind of 
remember it. [inaudible 00:43:22] came out of it with a magnet on the end? They're like, 
"Oh my god, that's so cool!" He was like, "Really?" "This is the [00:43:30] best thing I 
ever saw." And he was like, "You can have it." He gave me that and the guy gave me a 
quarter twenty screwdriver that threads. A thing that threads. 
Threader? 
We call it a threader... I don't know what it is. It's called a Tap. 
And what do you do with that? 
You thread holes so that you can put a screw into a hole without [00:44:00] putting 
anything on it. So far as me giving tools, tools are really not important to me. 
How do you choose to give a tool to someone?

If they are showing- they need it 
Is it typically an apprentice? 
Yeah, because the other guys can afford theirtools through [inaudible 00:44:22]. They 
all make the same amount of money, they know how much you make. [00:44:30] God, I 
remember struggling with money so bad when I was an apprentice. Especially my first 
year, it was hard because I was older and I felt like I was the same age as everybody and 
they're making way more money than me. But I remember not being able to, once you 
bought your weekly metro card- Maybe Thursdays and Fridays I couldn't get lunch. So I 
remember that. Where you couldn't buy a pack of cigarettes or you couldn't get coffee 
on the way to work a nd coffee and then coffee on the way home. That was not 
happening. So if I [00:45:00] see, especially a young apprentice, I just tell them it's okay. 
We were all there. Let a mechanic buy you coffee, they can afford it. Everybody went 
through the same thing of making really shit money in the beginning. 
Have you given a tool away recently to an apprentice? 
Let [00:45:30] me think who the last person was. No, I don't think this job. I think the 
last job I did. [inaudible 00:45:37] 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Do you have any aspirations as an electrician? Do you want to 
become a foreman? 
I don't. My only aspiration is continue working, retire, and not have any waves made 
upon me. I'm so happy to be what I'm doing and [00:46:00] you know as much as I wish I 
loved politics and wanted to make some positive changes, I don't. I just want to have a 
change where you work and you go home. I don't mind even doing overtime, but when 
it's a Saturday or a Sunday and I'm not working, I don't want to call anybody. I don't 
want anybody to call me. And I think that's really what's missing in this day and age. I 
think if you have a job that you're on call, with email and your phone and shit, you're on 
call [00:46:30] twenty-four hours a day basically to answer emails or texts. And I don't 
want that. 
And you don't have to have it. 
And I don't have to have it. 
I know you love your job so much, but is there anything you think you would change 
about it? Or improve upon it? 
Not really, I can't think of anything. [00:47:00] No, I don't think of anything. For other 
people, there's stuff. But not for me. 
Okay. 
I see other people struggling.

What are they struggling with mostly? 
I see people getting treated like shit. I don't want to say that I never allowed it because 
it just didn't happen to me. 
Yeah. 
So I'm [00:47:30] really fortunate about it. But I see the same people that I know never 
would have talked to me like that, talk to somebody else like that. You wish better for 
that person. But I'm pretty content with where I am. 
Yeah. 
I know people that have been- There's a girl in my class, they put her on a job and they 
treated her like shit, and they told her, "Here, a cordless drill." And they had her putting 
ground lugs [00:48:00] and motor mounts. And a motor mount is minimum a quarter of 
an inch of steel. And to give her a cordless drill, that you'd have to change the battery 
three times before you can even drill through the thing. She didn't know any better. 
[crosstalk 00:48:16] 
They had her doing their laundry. 
That's crazy. 
They were in the plant. You've got to leave the plant clothes there, you're not supposed 
to bring that stuff home to your kids and stuff. And I'm like, [00:48:30] you don't have to 
do their laundry, this isn't part of your job. She was stuck and she had to do it. I wish for 
people like that that they didn't have to- That never happened to me. 
You're definitely a one in a million type person. Do you think you would recommend this 
career to your kid? 
I have no intention of recommending a career path to [00:49:00] my child. Just follow 
your passion. That's my whole thing. Just follow your passion, I don't care what it is, it 
could be anything. It could be folding paper. And you could go on to become the person 
who decorates the origami tree at the museum. Just whatever your passion is, follow it. 
If they liked what I did, sure. But if that wasn't their passion I would never be the person 
that says- People came in that way, their parents were [00:49:30] like, "You're twenty, 
you haven't decided what to do yet, why don't you join? Here's your Local 3 paperwork 
and start going to work." I'd never do that. 
Do you think the work we're doing now is going to change? 
Of course, it has to. If it doesn't change, we're going to lose members and we're going to 
lose [00:50:00] work. Technology is changing so much that if we don't change with it- 
Which is very sad, because I think a lot of people aren't changing with it. We have to

grab the solar work. We have to grab the new ways of energy consumption and the way 
it's made. And if we don't grab onto that, we're going to lose our industry because that's 
what's coming up now. We need to be on top of [00:50:30] what happens in the 
electrical field. We can't say, "Oh we're not doing that because it's not hands-y work or 
there's not enough wires on it." Do you know what I'm saying? 
Yeah. 
We can't do that. Just because we don't understand it. At some point, I was beginningto 
hope and pray that big oil was going fail in their domination. It's probably going to take a 
[00:51:00] lump with it if we start doing windmills and waterwheels and stuff like that. 
But I think if we don't, and you don't learn how to do it- Think of LED lights. Ten years 
ago, LED lights were expensive, nobody wanted to install them because they were like, 
"What's this little wire?" 
The lighting was terrible 
It didn't [inaudible 00:51:23]deliver great light. And you think, look now, look at the 
Empire State Building. And if somebody didn't say, "Listen, we can do this and-" 
[00:51:30] Make it better. 
And that's our work. It's another thing to say it's our work. And say that it would never 
have happened, it was never used so much. And now LED's are cheaper than regular 
lights. And now they last for twenty years. 
They can come in any color you want. 
Yeah, you can program them. And if you don't stay on top of that work, obviously- There 
were old-timers who didn't want LED's because they just [00:52:00] simply don't want 
to put up a light that lasts for twenty years because it's taking away work. But you have 
to say, "Listen, it's going to happen whether you want it to or not. We need to grab hold 
of that work and do it." I think there should be a [inaudible 00:52:11] of every building in 
Manhattan. 
That's what you should do today. 
I saw this thing and it's a tree, it's the side of a tree, and it has these little things like 
round, little turbines on it that go on the tree. And that tree's enough for a house. That 
tree is enough [00:52:30] to make enough electricity for a house. We have to get into 
that shit. Design, all of that. Because we have Local 3 warehouses that make fixtures, 
that make LED's, that make all of this stuff. You have to get in all the way and make it 
and install it. And be the best at it. 
Do you think Local [00:53:00] 3 navigates people into the fact that you can design stuff, 
you can grow our section of the industry? Like making fixtures, as you said, engineering, 
little magnet flashlight tools or stuff like that.

I think that I am not connected- Because I'm not politically inclined, I am not connected 
to those people. I know those people exist and [00:53:30] I know they're there. But the 
waters that you have to tread to get to those people are not kind. I don't like those 
waters. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
I find those waters very uncomfortable. So, do I think it's valid? Yes. Have I been, has it 
been available to me? No, because I haven't put in my requisite that's beyond the eight 
hours, [crosstalk 00:53:53] I'll go to a rally, I will go do stuff, [00:54:00] I'll donate time to 
build a house. I'll do Sandy relief, I'll do that. And that's my option. But then another 
option is to do the political thing where you take trips to Washington D.C. or St Louis 
and go to the International-1 think if you get to know those people, of course, there's 
ways to get into law. There's ways to get to work for the union. I just work [00:54:30] for 
a contractor in the union. 
Do people in your neighborhood know that you're an electrician? 
Yes, because I live in a very blue collar neighborhood. 
Okay. 
I see people on job sites that are on the same train as me. I don't think that the people 
in my building know what I do. 
Would they be asking you to install lighting fixtures all the time? 
Yeah. They'd be like, "Can you look at this?" We have old gaslights in my [00:55:00] 
building, too. 
Oh my goodness. 
Change a switch and I'd be like, "I dunno." 
Not here. 
Do you do side work at all? 
No. 
No? I'm not into it for side work. 
It can get pretty messy in these old city buildings, eh? 
Yeah. 
Would you have any advice to pass down to someone in this field that's coming up?

[00:55:30] Show up and be on time, that's it. 
Show up a nd be o n ti me. 
That's all that's required of us. Show up, be on time. And then everything else is just 
what you make of it. That's basically it, right? Show up on time and work a seven hour 
day. Or eight hour day. Whatever they ask of you. And in the beginning, that's all you 
need to do. You don't have to be smart, you don't have to be funny, you don't have to 
know what you're doing when you're an apprentice. 
Mm-hmm [00:56:00] (affirmative). 
I mean, you can't be a total jackass. But that's all you really have to do is be on time. 
That's it. I think that's the most important thing: be on time. 
Do you feel compensated enough for your job? 
Does anybody feel compensated enough for their job? 
No. I don't think so. 
That's fair. 
Yeah, I don't think we're compensated enough. [00:56:30] Absolutely not. I think that 
what we do is very dangerous and I think that what we do keeps everybody in the 
building safe. So if we didn't know what we were doing and they got electrocuted 
plugging in their freaking iPhone, does that make a difference? 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
I think it does and I think that we should be paid for more. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
I think that if a toilet floods, no offense to the plumbers, if the [00:57:00] plumber 
doesn't do their job and the toilet floods, no one's goingto die. If we don't do ourjob 
right, someone can die. Very easily. I was at the apple store the other day and they 
didn't ground a handrail, [inaudible 00:57:13] go up those fucking stairs, man. And then 
the genius bar is upstairs so you go up, try to touch the handrail and you get 
electrocuted. It's a little thing, but it's not a little thing. Do you know what I'm saying? 
Somebody didn't do their [00:57:30] job properly. If we don't do ourjob properly, 
someone's going to get hurt very easily. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
The guy that has to do the fire sprinklers, they should probably make more money too. 
It's all life-saving shit.

And I mean, it's your life too. 
Yeah. 
You're risking your life doing this life-saving shit. 
Yeah. 
Is there anything that inspires you, Corinne? [00:58:00] Get up in the morning to do 
what you do? 
Inspiration is just like, it's just life. I fucked around for so many years, like thirty years, 
well I don't think the first ten years I don't really consider fucking around. From when I 
was a teenager until I was thirty, really free spirit and I really did whatever. I lived on my 
own since I was sixteen and I did whatever the hell I wanted [00:58:30] to. And I 
supported myself and I was always independent and I did whatever I wanted to. I was 
like, "Nobody can tell me what to do. I don't have to have a regular job, I can wear 
whatever I want." So at some point, you get so on the outside of doing whatever you 
want and not doing what everyone else is doing, at some point I got so messed up. 
The whole circle of life, going out and doing drugs, I [00:59:00] was up when nobody 
else was up and sleeping when everybody else was up. At some point, you get too 
wrapped up and you are like, you know what? You know what would be really cool to do 
is just to have a regular job and eat dinner at 6:30. So I did it. [inaudible 00:59:15] I was 
really fucked up on drugs and you know that song, It's Hip to Be Square? I was like, "Oh 
my god it's true!" That song is true. I was stuck on it for a whole night. Like what's wrong 
with you? I was tripping [00:59:30] out, "Oh my god, it is hip to be square. It is true." 
After all this shit when you're a teenager and you're rebellious and all that shit, and 
you're like, "Oh man, it'd be so nice just to go to work and then go home and do 
whateveryou want then." But in a way that fit into society. I forgot what your question 
was. 
So my inspiration is [01:00:00] I work to be able to do whatever the hell I want. Nobody 
can tell me-1 do the right thing in life and I network. So nobody can tell me shit. People 
think I'm a bitch, but I'm like, "You know what? I'm not a bitch because I know I do the 
right thing." 
I never thought you were a bitch. 
Some people really do. Some people that don't know me. Sometimes shit happens, we 
went to lunch late today because we were taking the transformers [01:00:30] in a giant 
whole. Some of my coworkers will be like, "Oh my god, we can't." I'm like, "I'm going to 
fucking lunch, man." We just worked through lunch and I always do the right thing and I 
always give of what I have to give and now I'm going to go eat lunch. I don't care if the 
super sees me coming back late because I can say without a problem yeah, I left late. 
And because I've done the right thing-

For so long. 
I don't feel [01:01:00] bad about it. And I like that feeling. That's the new "go screw 
yourself" is "I do right by whatever I can do to do right." That's my new way to say in my 
older age. When I was sixteen, I'd be like, "Fuck you" and give you the finger for no 
reason at all. But now, that's my way to be rebellious is to say, "I don't care if you don't 
like my shoes or my car or whatever, [01:01:30] I do right by myself." You know? 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
And my life, so that's my way. At work, I'm especially that way. We're not supposed to 
go out and get our own coffee. I've been doing it for seven years. 
Yep. 
And you know what? I'm back on time, I take the same amount of time and everybody 
else, but I get what I wa nt. A coffee. 
What do you get for coffee. 
Starbucks. 
Okay. 
You know why? Because I can order it on my phone. 
Oh, and then [crosstalk 01:02:00]. 
I get [01:02:00] there and it's there. 
Very convenient. 
And then I can sit down and drink it and then go back to work. 
Nice. 
And there's one on every corner so it's not like- 
So it's pretty amazing, you said that you fucked around for ten years and then you were 
able to have this opportunity. 
Yeah, that was because of NEW (Non Traditional Employment for Women)- Gave me the 
confidence to do it because my confidence was shot after these hard drugs for ten years 
straight, every day. [01:02:30] So you lose your confidence to go back into the real 
world. Because it's hard, people have houses and kids and families and shit and you're 
like, "Oh, the same shit I had ten years ago." Nothing's changed with me. That's when I 
went to the training program. They gave me the confidence to be like, "Ugh, shit, look

you can carry a bucket of compounds." And everyone's like, "oh my god, I can't believe 
you can pick that up." And I'm like, "huh." Not everybody can carry that up the stairs, 
you know? I was like, look at that. So that kind of boosted my confidence a little bit 
[01:03:00] enough to go into it. I just found I fit pretty good. Honestly, I don't know, if I 
didn't, if I were to have left at that point, I don't know. It was a nook that I really enjoy. 
Because I feel like you look stronger if you just use your mind a little bit more, also. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
There's some shit. Like an iron worker, he just got- There's no smart way about it. 
You've got to [01:03:30] lift the high beam up. But with our stuff. You can use your brain 
instead of, you can either be on the tea m that uses their brawn or the team that uses 
their brain. Try to- 
Dabble between both? 
Yeah. No, having the brawn gave me the confidence. So now I don't have to use it as 
much. I'm getting old and pregnant. 
Huh, interesting, [inaudible 01:03:52] Well I will let you go then. 
Okay. 
Thank you so [01:04:00] much for coming. 
Thanks for having me. 
No, thank you. Really. How do I stop this?
