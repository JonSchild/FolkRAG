My name it is Lyons, a 
merchant by trade, 
Oh. I'm in the old clothing line, 
I'd sell you new trowsers and second-hand boots, 
I 
warrant them all superfine; 
Suspen leis and socks, hats, neckties and bows, 
Oh, it's garters and shoe- laces, too; 
Olt, take them at cost price, my gracious, they're nice, 
So beautiful, lovely, and new. 
CLIORLTS. 
Old clothes! I 
buy and sell, 
Walk in the store, I'll treat you well, 
Now, old clothes, when it's hard times, 
Come buy of Mordecai Lyons. 
Alexander, my brother, he lc:ieps a 
pawn-shop, 
Where the sports and the gamblers all went 
hid vatches and diamonds, sealskin overcoats, 
At six in mths, at forty per cent ; 
Three balls is the sign, the number is nine, 
Von can see his terms " Gish!" on the ‘vall, 
He's worth, I 
am told, just one million in gold, 
lie made on the Black Friday fall. 
Old Clothes, etc.. 
On Sunday I 
goes, I 
put on my new clothes, 
ThF.y cost me a 
five-dollar note, 
Go by the horse car I 
ride awfully far, 
It's cheaper than wagon or boat; 
I 
do whit I 
can, I'm not a mean man, 
I 
don't let a 
beggar pass by, 
A penny I 
give, oh, the poor man must live; 
I 
can't take it all when I 
die.

At Macy's Grand Emporium 
met a 
charmer fair, 
Oh, she was selling neckties 
To the swells that gathend there: 
I 
stepped up to the counter, 
I 
said, " My name is 171-ash." 
Said I, " My pretty little girl," 
She simply holloa'd " Cash!" 
Cnonus. 
It was " Cash! Cash ! Ca sh I" 
With a 
smash, smash, smash, 
Oh, she hammer'd on the counter 
For number Forty-nine: 
It was " Cash! Cash! Cash!" 
I 
thought I 
had a 
mash, 
But ‘vhen I 
went to speak to her, 
'Twas " Cash! Cash! Cash!" 
I 
asked her for a 
price- list, then 
She handed me a 
book, 
Oh, then I 
looked it over 
For to see if she would look, 
She never condescended, 
Which made me rather brash, 
Said I, " My pretty little girl," 
She simply murmur'd " Cash!" 
I 
paid her for a 
necktie, 
A regular bon ton, 
I 
asked her if she'd be so kind 
To help me put it on; 
She leaned across the counter 
In a 
manner very rash, 
I 
kiss'd her on her pretty cheek, 
She simply hollou'd `• Cash!" 
Up came a 
pretty little child 
About the age of nine, 
She whisper'd softly to him, 
" 
Call hither Mister Ryan." 
A monster large Hihernitui, 
Ho hit me such a 
smash, 
As I 
went through the doorway, 
Oh, I 
heard her holloa " Cash!"

In the old palmy days 
We had red-hot plays,

boy in the Old Bow'ry pit, 
Now Cook played a

To the boys in the Old Bow'ry pit." 
In the old palmy days, etc. 
There's no use of grieving, 
The stage has gone wrong 
Since the old timers pass'd out and quit; 
Oh, then we'd have " Hamlet," 
" 
Ben Bolt" with a 
song, 
Would the boys in the Old Bow'ry pit. 
In the old palmy days, etc. 
Oh, I 
have seen Forrest, 
Macrettdy, and Keen, 
The bosses, now don't you forgit; 
When the'd walk on the stage we 
Would stand up and scream, 
Would the boys of the Old Bow'ry pit. 
In the old palmy days, etc. 
Oh, most all the good ones 
Lay under the clay, 
Farewell to their talent and wit; 
The old stock's plity'd out, oh, 
It don't live to- day, 
No more does the Old Bow'ry pit.

Oh! father's gone to market town 
He was up before the clay, 
And Jamie's after robins' nests, 
And the man is making hay; 
And whistling down the hollow goes 
The boy that minds the mill, 
While mother, from the kitchen door, 
Is calling with a 
will: 
Polly! Polly! the cows are in the corn! 
Polly ! Polly! the cows are in the corn! 
From nil the misty morning air 
There comes a. summer sound, 
A murmur, as of waters, comes 
From ships, and trees, and ground; 
The birds they sing upon the wing, 
The pigeons bill and coo, 
And over hills and hollow rings 
Again the loud halloo! 
Polly! Polly! the cows are in the corn! 
Polly! Polly! the cows are in the corn! 
How strange at such a 
time of day 
The mill should stop its clatter; 
The farmer's wife is listening now, 
And wonders what's the matter. 
011! wild the birds are singing in 
The woodland on the hill, 
While whistling up the hollow goes 
The boy that minds the mill.

Published by request. 
urwas the eve before Christmas, " good night " had 
been said, 
And Annie and Willie had crept into bed; 
There were tears on their pillows and tears in their 
eyes, 
And each little bosom was heaving with sighs; 
For to-night their stern father's command had been 
giveti 
That they should retire precisely at seven— 
Instead of eight— for they troubled him more 
With questions unheard a 
than ever before. 
He told them he thought this delusion a 
sin--
No such person as " Santa Clan s" ever had been— 
And he hoped, after this, he should never more hear 
How he scrambled down chimneys with presents 
each year. 
And this was the reason that two little heads 
So restlessly tossed on their soft, downy beds. 
Eight, nine, and the clock on the steeple tolled ten; 
Not a 
word had been spoken by either till then, 
When Willie's sad face from the blanket did peep 
As he whispered; " Dear Annie, is 'ou fas' asleep?" 
" 
Why, no, Brother Willie," a 
sweet voice replies; 
" ve long tried in vain, but 1 
can't shut my eyes, 
For somehow it makes me so sorry because 
Dear papa has said there is 110 Santa Claus. 
Now, we know there is, and it can't be denied 
For he came every year before mamma died; 
But, then, I've been thinking that she used to pray, 
And God would hear everything mamma would say, 
And maybe she asked Him to send Santa Claus here 
With the sack full of presents he brought every year." 
"Well, why tan't we pray dust as mamma did den, 
And ask Dot to send him with presents a,den ?" 
" 
I've been thinking so too," and without a word 
more 
Four little bare feet bounded out on the floor 
Lads, a-4444*.

ANNIE AND WILLIE'S PRAYER. 
(Continued.) 
Arid four little knees the soft carpet pressed, 
And two tiny hands were clasped close to each breast. 
" 
Now. Willie, you know that we must firmly believe 
That the presents we ask for we're sure to receive; 
Vou must wait just as still 
till I 
say the 
Amen,' 
And by that you will know that your turn has come 
then. 
Dear Jesus, look down on my brother and me, 
And grant us the favor we are asking of Thee. 
want a 
wax dolly, a 
tea- set and ring, 
And an ebony work- box that shuts with a 
spring. 
Bless papa, dear Jesus, and cause him to see 
That Santa Claus loves us as much as does he: 
Don't let him get fretful and angry again 
At dear Brother Willie and Annie. 
Amen." 
"Please, Deesus, let Santa Taus turn down to- night, 
And bring us sonic presents before it is light; 
I 
want he should div me a 
nice ' ittle sed, 
With bright shining 'unners, and all painted red; 
A. box full of tandy, a 
book and a 
toy. 
Amen, and den, Deesus, I'll be a 
dood boy:' 
Their prayers being ended, they raised up their 
heads, 
And, with hearts light and cheerful, again sought 
their beds. 
rhey were soon lost in slumber both peaceful and 
deep, 
And with fairies in dreamland were roaming in sleep. 
Eight, nine, and the little French clock had strrn:k 
ten 
Ere the father had thought of his children again. 
He seems now to hear Annie's half-suppressed sighs, 
And to see the big tears stand in Willie's blue eyes. 
"I was harsh with my darlings," he mentally said, 
" 
And should not have sent them so early to bed; 
But then I 
was troubled; my feelings found vent, 
For bank- stock to-day has gone down ten per cent; 
13iit of course they've forgotten their troubl-rs ere this, 
'77" • 
32 
ANNIE AND WILLIL s PRAYER-
(Continued.) - 
And that I 
denied them the thrice-asked-for kiss; 
And, just to make sure, I'll steal up to the door, 
For I 
never spoke harsh to may darlings before." 
So saying, he softly ascended the stairs, 
And arrived at the door to hear both of their prayers, 
Ili nnie's " Bless papa!" drew forth the big tears, 
And NVillie's grave promise fell sweet on his ears. 
" 
Strange—strange—rd forgotten," said he with r. 
sigh, 
"How I longed when a child to have Christmas 
draw nigh. 
I'll atone for may harshness," he inwardly said, 
" 
By answering their prayers ere I 
sleep in may bed." 
Then turned to the stairs and softly went down, 
Threw off velvet slippers and silk dressing gown, 
Donned hat, coat and boots, and was out in the 
streets, 
A millionaire facing the cold, driving sleet! 
Nor stopped he until he had bought everything, 
Prom the box full of candy to the tiny gold ring; 
Indeed, lie kept adding so much to his store 
That the various presents outnumbered a 
score; 
Then homeward he turned, when his holiday load, 
With Aunt Mary's help in the nursery was stowed, 
Miss Dolly was seated beneath a 
pine tree, 
By the side of a 
table s'pread out for her tea; 
A work-box well filled in the centre was laid, 
And on it the ring for which Annie had prayed ;-
A soldier in uniform stood by a 
sled, 
" 
With bright shining run n 
erS, and all painted red;" 
There were balls, dogs and horses, books pleasing to 
see, 
And birds of all colors were perched in the tree; 
While Santa Claus, laughing, stood up in the top, 
As if getting ready more presents to drop. 
And, as the fond father the picture surveyed, 
lie thought for his trouble lie had amply been paid; 
And he said to lihnself as he brushed off a 
tear: 
33 
'ANNIE AND WILLIE'S PRAYER. 
(Concluded.) 
" 
I'm nappier to-night than I've been for a 
year. 
I've enjoyed more true pleasure than ever before— 
What care I 
if bank-stock falls ten per cent more? 
Hereafter I'll make it a 
rule, I 
believe, 
ro have Santa Claus visit us each Christmas-eve.' 
So thinking, he gently extinguished the light, 
And tripping down stairs, he retired for the night. 
.As soon as the beams of the bright morning sun 
Put the darkness to flight, and the stars one by one, 
Pour little blue eyes out of sleep opened wide, 
And, at the same moment, the presents espied: 
Then out of their beds they sprang with a 
bound, 
And the very gifts prayed for were all of them found. 
They laughed and they cried, in their innocent glee, 
And shouted for papa to conic quick and see 
1Vhat presents old Santa Claus brought in the night 
(Just the things that they wanted), and left before 
light. 
" 
And now," added Annie in voice soft and low, 
"You'll believe there's a`Santa, Claus,' papa, I 
know ;" 
While dear little Willie climbed up on his knee, 
Determined no secret between them should be, 
And told in soft whispers how Annie had said 
That their dear, blessed mamma, so ion.- ago dead, 
Used to kneel down and pray by the side of her chair, 
And that God up in heaven had answered her prayer. 
"Den we dot up and prayed dust as well as we tood; 
And Dod answered our prayers; now, wasn't He 
dood?" 
" 
I 
should say that He was if lie sent you all these, 
And knew just what presents my children would 
please. 
(Well, well, let him think so, the dear little elf; 
'Twould be cruel to tell him I 
did it myself.") 
Blind father! Who caused your stern heart to relent, 
And the hasty words spoken so soon to repent? 
'Twas the Being who bade you steal softly -up stair., 
And made you His agent to answer their prayers.

Like a

Round me echoed soft and low, 
Still your mem'ries linger near me, 
Chiming bells of long ago! 
Sweetly fell your silv'ry numbers, 
Down the still and fragrant air; 
Woke my soul from gentle slumbers 
List'ning to your echoes fair! 
Friends and hopes of happy childhood 
Blest me in their purest glow; 
Softly rang o'er grove and wildwood, 
Chiming bells of long ago! 
CHORUS. 
Sweet chiming bells! sweet chiming bellsi 
Ye murmur soft and low! 
Sweet chiming bells! sweet chimhq.,

Sweet bells of long ago! 
Happy visions rose before me, 
Brightest that my heart could know; 
Still your spell is ling'ring near me, 
Chiming bells of long ago! 
Sweetly now your notes are falling, 
O'er may heart so sad and lone; 
Mein'ry from the past is calling 
Dreams that once I 
called my own; 
Visions of my dear ones only 
Bless me now at evening's glow; 
Oh, ye cheer my life so lonely, 
Chiming bells of long ago!

TB E ITA ', IAN MO UNT A 
IN MAID . 
As sung by the favorite Motto Vocalist, JOHNNY GIBBONS. 
There is a 
pretty litt he maiden that I 
ever dearly love', 
ln Italy .that bright and sunny land; 
My life would be a 
pleasure, I 
would ask for nothing 
More, 
If she would only share my In,art and hand. 
For her father was a 
brigand on a lonely mountain 
pass 
And with him on the mountain she (toes dwell, 
There is no titled lady in all Europe can surpass 
The dear Italian girl I 
love so weR. 
CHORUS. 
lIer father was a 
brigand on the mountain, 
She is as gentle as the daughter of an earl, 
And since she set Inc free, my heart \vitt ever be 
A captive to the dear Italian girl. 
While roaming through the village 'neath the blue 
and sunny sky, 
A 
band of sturdy brigands, bold and strong, 
Dikl capture me, and helpless, put a 
bandage on my 
eyes, 
A victim I 
was led along. 
Five thousand pounds as ransom they said that I 
should pay, 
But that I 
was not rich enough to give, 
And only for the pleading of this little mountain maid 
They would not have la'rmitted me to live. 
They put me in a dungeon where I thought that I 
should die, 
And while the brigand chief with all his band 
Was plundering poor travelers, this lovely maid came 
nigh 
At gloomy night and by my side did stand. 
She tore my bonds asunder, bade me rise and set me 
free,
Andfi•om her father's coffers saved my gold, 
And while the tears of love and pity gladdened in her 
eyes, 
The ,,ecret of our hearts was plainly told.

KATY'S LETTER. 
Och, girls, dear, did you ever hear 
I 
wrote my love a 
letter? 
,And although he cannot read, 
I 
thought ' twas all the better; 
For why should he be puzzled 
W .ith hard spelling in the matter, 
When the maning was so plain 
That I 
loved him faithfully, 
And he knows it—oh ! he knows it— 
Without one Nvord from me. 
I 
wrote it, and I 
folded it, 
And put a 
seal upon it; 
'Twas a 
seal almost as big 
As the crown of my best bonnet; 
For I 
would not have the postmaster 
Make his remarks upon it, 
As I'd said inside the letter 
That I 
loved him faithfully, 
And he knows it—oh! he knows it— 
Without one word from me. 
My heart was full, but when I 
wrote 
I 
dare not put it half in; 
The neighbors know I 
love him, 
And they're mighty fond of chaffing; 
So I 
dare not write his name outside, 
For fear they would be laughing, 
So I 
wrote: " For little Kate to one 
Whom she loves faithfully," 
And he knows it—oh! he knows it— 
Without one word from me. 
Now, girls, would you believe it, 
That postman, so consated, 
No answer will he bring me, 
So long as I 
have waited; 
But maybe there mayn't be one, 
For the rason that I 
stated, 
That my love can neither read nor write, 
But loves me faithfully, 
And I 
know where'er my love is, 
That ho is true to me.'

KENTUCKY ROSE. 
With the compliments of the author of the words and music, IVAL-
TER BRAY. 
As sung by TONY HART with great success at Harrigan Sc Hart's 
Theatre Comique, 514 Broadway, N. Y. 
Oh, the rose of Kentucky and me, 
Long ago old mosso set us free; 
I'll tell you what did happen in her good old mother 
. 
cabin 
To the rose of Kentucky and me. 
On the banks of the Ohio River, 
Where the winters are so cold the darkies shiver; 
One night about eight, we joined the married state. 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
CHORUS. 
On the banks of the river, that old muddy river, 
She lived on the banks of the river; 
And one night about we joined the married state, 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
When they tiled to win niv rose away from me, 
My wife alone she said she'd be; 
Yet their vanity she flattered, and their hearts she al-
ways shattered, 
When they tried to play that game on me, you see.. 
Her voice filled this darkey full of glee, 
She's as merry and as busy as a 
bee; 
love when I 
look at her, she's black, but that's no 
matter, 
She's just the shade I'd have my darling be. 
On the banks, etc. 
Since I 
took Kentucky Rose for my wife, 
We have lived together, free from care or strife; 
And it's natural to suppose, we had a 
little Rose, 
For so sweetly flowed the summer of our life. 
Yet the winter of our days will come, alas! 
When sprino-, summer and autumn, too, will pas.:
, 
Hand in hand we'll glide away, and I'll bless the hap.

took Kentucky Rose for my wife.

LISTEN TO TH E OLD CHUR CH BELL 
Sung by C. 
HEYWOOD. 
Floating down the sunny vale,. 
Wafted over brook and dell, 
On the summer's perfumed gale. 
Conies the chiming of the bell,. 
Soft and low it sways along, 
Up and down in fitful swell, 
Still the same sweet, happy sound, 
Listen to the old church bell. 
Still the same sweet, happy sound 
Listen to the old church bell.

Ring its chimes 
Listen to the

Many years I've passed afar 
From the old church in the dell, 
Yet sweet meidries wakened are 
By the voice of that old bell 
Visions come and visions go, 
More than words of mine can 
And my heart sways to and fro 
List'ning to the old church 
And my heart sways to and 11.0, 
List'ning to the old church bell. 
Sweet and low, etc. 
When the stars above the vale 
Smile upon the peaceful dell, 
Then at vesper hour a 
tale 
Chimes the gently swinging bell, 
Tales of youth and life's fair May, 
Crown'd with love's sweet magic spell, 
Where my heart delights to stray 
. 
List'ning to the old church bell, 
Where my heart delights to stray 
List'ning to tha old church bell.

We'll chase the devil around the stump, 
There's one wide river to cross! 
We'll chase the devil around the stump, 
There's one wide river to cross! 
CHORUS. 
One wide river, one wide river to cross! 
One wide river, one wide river to cross. 
When duty calls us to the field, 
The order we'll obey, 
If to defend our native land, 
We'll mingle in the fray! 
And by our camp- fires burning bright, 
We'll have a 
jolly spree, 
We'll tell our jokes and sing our songs, 
And laugh and shout with glee! 
I 
love to hear the stirring drum, 
The cannon's booming roar; 
To be a 
soldier is my joy, 
I 
ask for nothing mon?! 
And when our battles all are o'er, 
A 
joyous pDtce to come 
To meet our comrades side by side, 
it is the Soldiers H OIP2.

ONLY A PIN. 
As recited by the Great Comedian, HARRY G. 
RICHMOND. 
It was only a 
pin! 
As it lay on the floor, 
Shining and bright, 
And it glistened in the noonday light, 
Only a 
boy! 
Yet he saw that pin; 
And on its possession became so intent 
That soon both boy and pin alike were bent. 
Only a 
chair! 
Yet he placed the pin there, 
And not on in a 
thousand could have discerned 
That the point of the pin was heavenward turned 
Only a 
man! 
Yet he sat on that chair, 
Then he bounced in the air like a 
cork from a 
bottle, 
:\nd a 
most unearthly sound camc.ont of hh thlottle 
Only a 
yell': 
But it was an honest one; 
It rent the air—and soon boy, man and chair 
n 
OA 
in 
much confusion 
close communion 
were.

OLD-FASHIONED CHURCH ON THE HILL. 
Sung by W ALTER PERENIX with great success. 
Music published by T. B. Halms & Co., N. Y. Will be sent by us to 
any address. 
Price 33 cents. 
There's an old-fashioned home that is not far away, 
And an old happy couple Jive there; 
There's an old wooden pump by the side of the gate, 
And a 
sweet lilac tree scents the air. 
There's an old-fashioned woman that always smiles 
As she watches the sweet mountain rose, 
3lie's an old fashioned cap on her snowy white head 
And she's dressed in the old style of clothes. 
Clitottus. 
Listen to those sweet bells, 
My joyous soul cloth fill; 
Listen to those sweet bells, 
In the old-fashioned church on the hill. 
There's an old fashioned clock on the old mantel 
piece, 
With its long swinging pendlum and hands, 
There's a 
large wooden bench by the old fireplace, 
And the broom in the corner it stands; 
There's a 
quiet old man by the fireplace sits 
And he smokes his long- treasured pipe, 
There's an old-fashioned bed in a 
warm cozy room, 
That they kneel by to pray every night. 
Listen to those sweet bells, etc.

TRIED AND TRUE. 
Sung with great success by the great, the only, Serb-Comic, Mrss 
M INNIE LEE. 
In this world full of deceit quite often do we meet 
One who in hour of need does prove a 
friend; 
If along life's weary road we sink beneath our load, 
To us a 
helping hand they'll always lend. 
They may not be men of wealth, but they do good 
by stealth, 
But when from this world they've passed from 
view, 
Though numbered with the dead of them it can be 
said, 
When tried we always found them true. 
There is a 
glorious name inscribed on the roll of 
Fame, 
Of his great deeds posterity will tell. 
He was honest, he was just, and true to every trust, 
And on his post on duty then he fell. 
In our country's hour of need he was a 
friend indeed, 
His duty he did always try to do; 
When he fell by the assassin's hand there was mourn-
ing in our land, 
For Garfield, when tried, was always true. 
To the sons of Erin's isle where fortune yet w:!1 
smile, 
And among republics yet she'll proudly stand; 
There is one who did bravely fall, and who's memory 
is dear to all, 
Who loved the freedom of their native land. 
Ile fell in manhood's prime, and died before his time, 
lie done what all true patriots will do, 
For his country's cause to Freedom and just laws 
Young Emmett, when tried, was always true.

WE NEVER SPEAK AS WE PASS BY. 
liusic pun ished and copprig,lited 1t3S!? by SPEAR & DEIINOFF, 717 
Broadway, N. V. 
Price 40 cents. 
The spell is past, the dream is o'er, 
And tho' we meet we love no more. 
One heart is crusli'd to droop and die, 
And for relief must heav'nward 
The once bright smile has faded—gone — 
And given way to looks forlorn. 
Despite her grandeur's wicked flame 
She stoops to blush beneath her shame. 
CHORUS. 
Wj never speak as we pass by, 
Altho' a tear bedims her eye; 
I know she thinks of her past life, 
When we were loving man and wife. 
In guileless youth I sought her side, 
And she became my' virtuous bride; 
Our lot was peace— so fair, so bright; 
One sunny day, no gloomy night. 
No life on earth more pure than ours 
in that dear home midst field and flow'rs, 
Until the tempter came to Nell. 
It dazzled her— alas, she fell! 
We never speak, etc. 
In gilded hall, midst wealth
-sha dwells; 
How her heart aches her sad face tells! 
She fain would smile— seem bright and gay; 
But conscience steals her peace away. 
And when the flaterer casts aside 
My fallen and dishonored bride, 
I'll close her eyes in death—forgive! 
And in my heart her name shall live. 
We never speak, etc •

"l'M JlJST GOING DOWN TO THE GATE." 
Copyright, 1882,, by. W . 
A. 
EVANS tit Bno. 
Music by J P. SKELLY, and written and sung xvith great success by 
Gus W ILLIAMS. 
The music of this song is published by W. A. EVANS & CO , 10 Park 
Place. N. Y. City. or N) Bromfield St., Boston, Mass. 
Price 6 
cents in postage stamps. 
All rights reserved. 
My sweetheart's a 
sly little fairy, 
Her ago it is just seventeen; 
Her parents think that she's too airy. 
But a 
sweeter girl never was seen. 
At night she steals out from the cottage, 
Her mother cries after " Kate," 
She answers, " Dear ma, 
not going far, 
I'm just going down to the gate." 
Ctionus. 
"cm just going down to the gate, dear ma," 
Just down to the old garden gate, 
The wool' is so bright and it's such a 
nice night. 
I'll go just as far as the gate." 
Of course at the gate I 
am waiting, 
And sweet are the words that we say, 
While inside the old folks are debating 
As to whether they'll move first of May. 
Sometimes they call gently for Katie; 
She answers, " Dear ma, ' tis not late. 
There's no sign of storm, and the night is so warm, 
I 
love to stand down by the gate 
" 
rm just going down, etc. 
They say she's too young to be married, 
But with them we do not agree; 
Love's message to Katie I 
carried. 
And a 
kiss was the answer for me. 
We'll wander alone in the moonlight. 
Much longer I'm sure we can't wait; 
Some night by- and- bye to the preacher's we'll fly 
When Katie comes down to the gate. 
" 
I'm just going down," etc

AN IRISHMAN'S TOAST. 
Pang with great success by the great Irish Comb:the; films Se 
GEORGE H USSEY. 
There's a 
green little isle that is far across the sea 
Which misfortune compelled me to leave, 
Vet still for that Emerald Isle of the sea, 
In my heart I 
always will grieve. 
Its hills and its valleys, its brooks and its streams, 
In memory now I 
do see, 
kud thd dear little spot where my childhood was 
spent, 
Will ne'er be forgotten by me. 
CHORUS. 
here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen, 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God bless ould Ireland is an Irkhman's toast, 
Twas there the best days of my lifetime were spent, 
'Tis there that my colleen does: dwell, 
And, oh, how I 
love this green little isle, 
Only I, who am exiled, can tell. 
The sea now divides us, I'm away from my twine, 
And its green shores I 
never may see, 
But in sunshnE. or sorrow, old Erin agree, 
This toast L 
will now drink to thee.
