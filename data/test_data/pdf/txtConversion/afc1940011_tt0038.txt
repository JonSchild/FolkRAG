Lord, son, come home.
How can I go when I got no ready-made money? How can I go when I got no ready-made
money? I can't go home, Lord, Lord, I can't go home.
If I just had me one more dollar and a quarter, If I just had me one more dollar and a
quarter. I'd go back home, Lord, Lord, I'd go back home.
I left my baby standin in the back door cryin, I left my baby standin in the back door cryin.
Daddy don't go, Lord, Lord, daddy don't go.
Do you see that dark cloud risin over yonder? Do you see that dark cloud risin over
yonder? It's sign of rain, Lord, Lord, it's sign of rain.
Cap'm, have you heard all your men goin leave you? Cap'm, have you heard all your men
goin leave you? On the next payday, Lord, Lord, on the next payday.

The first line of each verse was sung by a single man, and the entire crew joined in on the
