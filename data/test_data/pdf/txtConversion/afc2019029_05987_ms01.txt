[00:00:00] Brief introduction; Matt Sigmon (“Matt Sigmon,” “The Heatseekers”) describes basic 
personal background information including his date of birth, his hometown of Middlesboro, 
Kentucky, and his current place of residence in Knoxville, Tennessee. 
 
[00:01:45] Sigmon explains that his fondness for professional wrestling began at an early age. 
He draws connections between his love for superheroes and watching wrestlers perform athletic 
maneuvers in the ring. “I was hooked immediately.” As he got older, Sigmon attended live 
events hosted by local and regional promotions. He likens performing to an “adrenaline rush” 
where “all eyes are specifically on you.” Sigmon values competition and athleticism over 
theatrical productions. He has worked as a personal trainer, a gym owner, and now offers remote 
coaching through Noom. “Health has always been a really cool, big part of my life...but it all 
goes back to wrestling.” 
 
[00:05:03] Sigmon recounts his journey towards becoming an independent professional wrestler. 
Jim Cornette’s Smoky Mountain Wrestling promotion hosted events near Sigmon’s hometown in 
Kentucky. In high school, Sigmon says he “fantasized” about becoming a wrestler and sought 
out information online. He recalls a national movement geared towards “exposing” wrestling and 
mentions a ​20/20 ​broadcast special that featured Killer Kowalski’s training school in Boston, 
Massachusetts. Sigmon traveled up north to train as a wrestler for a week. “I came home bruised 
up, banged up, and I wanted more.” Sigmon was introduced to notable professional wrestler and 
trainer Dr. Tom Prichard. Sigmon trained with Prichard for several months before branching out 
to wrestle at other promotions throughout the region.  
 
[00:09:37] Sigmon outlines the structure of his training sessions. Lessons were every weekday 
after school whereas weekends were for traveling to shows. “Getting our feet wet, so to speak.” 
Learning the foundations of wrestling and the wrestling industry. “I was just an ordinary high 
school kid that wanted to jump in the ring.” Sigmon explains that his interest in professional 
wrestling and adopting a healthy lifestyle took root at the same time. “I went from a high school 
kid to feeling like an 80 year old man in months.” 
 
[00:11:42] Sigmon attempts to distinguish how the indie pro wrestling scene differs from larger 
televised spectacles. He notes that Prichard’s training focused on “what has worked for a very 
long time.” As far as wrestling styles are concerned, Sigmon believes there’s “something for 
everybody.” Catering to niche audiences has become more acceptable.  
 
[00:13:45] Sigmon shares memories of some of his first matches. “They were terrible, but at the 
time I thought they were great.” Sigmon’s first match was in Harlan, Kentucky against “Ryan 
Dookie,” which made him second-guess his decision to become a professional wrestler. He talks 
about constantly trying to hone his craft in an environment that demanded an intense level of 
dedication. He talks about his rigorous travel and performance schedule.  
 
[00:17:05] Sigmon discusses his in-ring persona, which he believes is a natural extension of 
himself. Sigmon and his tag-team partner are oftentimes the “heels” (i.e. “bad guys”) at shows,

which differs drastically from his day-to-day approach to life. Intensity and a degree of 
seriousness are important to Sigmon. “I try to honor what the people that came before me 
worked so hard to protect.” 
 
Sigmon talks about meeting his tag-team partner, Elliott Russell, and the creation of “The 
Heatseekers.” Always fascinated by tag-team partnerships. Sigmon originally trained Russell and 
several other younger wrestlers, and they often wrestled as opponents on weekends. Eventually 
they transitioned into tag-team partners, and have been wrestling together for the last seven 
years. Sigmon sheds light on the dynamics and complexities of wrestling as a tag-team. “There’s 
always something special about tag-team wrestling.” Russell is more of a “powerhouse brawler” 
whereas Sigmon sees himself as a “technical guy.” 
 
[00:22:40] Sigmon describes a typical show day from start to finish. He meets up with Russell on 
a Thursday or Friday and they use the road trip as a space to refocus their energy on the 
upcoming shows. He mentions exercising and brainstorming spots for their match. Sigmon 
prefers arriving at the arena early while Russell waits until the last minute. He details their 
pre-match rituals. “Once it’s showtime, once it’s time to take business serious, then we get 
ready.”  
 
He also muses on the locker room as being a “sacred space.” “Depends on the locker room.” 
Sigmon feels like there have been too many “outsiders” let in behind the curtain, and notes that it 
used to be much more difficult to break into the industry.  
 
[00:27:50] Sigmon expands on the idea of wrestlers as storytellers. He speaks about his 
responsibility to give fans a solid performance that offers an escape from reality. Sigmon feels 
like storytelling is a “lost art these days” where younger wrestlers are only concerned with 
showing off their athletic ability. “...looking like a Cirque du Soleil act and not getting the 
emotional investment.” 
 
Sigmon discusses how he maintains relationships with audience members both in and out of the 
ring. As a heel, he prefers to stay in the locker room away from crowds. Sigmon limits his 
interactions with fans in order to protect appearances. He talks about the incongruity between 
heels eliciting a negative reaction from fans and then taking friendly pictures after the match. He 
segues into maintaining a social media presence and interacting with fans online. “It’s tough to 
navigate these days.” 
 
[00:31:57] Sigmon comments on the differences between international audiences and those 
throughout central Appalachia. “The cool thing about central Appalachia is the people, 
sometimes, still believe to a certain extent.” Crowds as easily riled up (e.g. jumping in the ring, 
following wrestlers to their cars, drawing guns and knives on wrestlers), but heavily invested 
emotionally. Sigmon also reflects on how the Appalachian region has shaped his approach to 
wrestling.  
 
[00:36:45] Sigmon examines the more challenging aspects of professional wrestling. He notes 
that wrestling is “political” (i.e. “It’s who you know!”) and all about “timing.” Being in the right

place at the right time to seize an opportunity. Sigmon cautions against those who are only 
looking out for themselves. “Anybody can go to the gym. Anybody can get in good shape. 
Anybody can study wrestling and get a decent foundation as long as they’re willing to work for 
it.” However, politics and timing are two things beyond the control of most wrestlers.  
 
[00:38:54] Sigmon shares some of his more memorable matches and those he has used as 
learning opportunities. “Every single match is a learning experience.” Wrestling The Rock ‘n’ 
Roll Express and other childhood heroes. He lists several other formidable tag-team duos 
throughout the south. Weaker matches are inevitable, but adaptation is key.  
 
[00:41:35] Sigmon explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected independent promotions. 
“It has been terrible for wrestling.” Significant decrease in events. Sigmon recalls losing 30 
scheduled shows in a single day, which ultimately impacts personal finances and expenditures. 
Taking extra precaution in deciding which promotions and wrestlers to work with. Promotions 
and wrestlers forced to re-evaluate how they conduct business in the future. “I’m glad I’m not a 
decision-maker when it comes to rules and regulations.” 
 
[00:49:00] Sigmon touches on trends in the wrestling industry, especially in relation to treatment 
of women and people of color. “Wrestling has done a pretty good job of eliminating people this 
year that don’t support that.” Room for improvement and growth across the board. “I don’t see 
many negatives from these changes just yet.” 
 
Sigmon discusses where he sees his career headed over the course of the next several years. 
Wrestlemania matches and WWE contracts are always the primary goal. He envisions The 
Heatseekers earning a national television contract. “I’m still gonna be in wrestling.”  
 
[00:53:24] Sigmon offers advice to those interested in becoming professional wrestlers. “Don’t 
do it.” He talks about the rewarding aspects of wrestling but acknowledges the toll it takes on 
someone mentally, emotionally, and physically. Finding a reputable training school or investing 
with a well-respected trainer. “Vet the process and see who’s gonna work the best for you.” 
Sacrifice time and relationships. A positive mental attitude “can work wonders.” 
 
[00:57:32] Closing remarks. Sigmon once again reflects on how the Appalachian region has 
molded him into the wrestler he is today. “This area is rich in amazing, amazing wrestlers.”
