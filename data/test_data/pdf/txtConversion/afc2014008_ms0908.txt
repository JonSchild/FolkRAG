Dear Ms. Hawes
 
The Guam Legislature has just ruled that because of b dcjet problems the
 
University must cease all publications -
-
 temporarily at least. The
 
University had been dragging its feet on editing my A Tidy Universe of
 
Islands, and its publication has been temporarily cancelled.
 I want you
 
to know that I am now starting over again to find a publisher.
 
Actually, I am not disappointed by this development since I had become
 
convinced that the University does not have editing capability for
 
anything as long and complex as my manuscript.  Recently I have been
 
rewriting quite a bit of the manuscript in an effort to give the
 
chapters (
some written years apart) better continuity.
 I have ordered a
 
computer so that I can revise more methodically, and so I can record on
 
disks.
 I will send a disk to you, if you are interested.
 
I think that I sent you a copy of A Chuukese Testament.
 If I failed to
 
o this please let me know and I will mail one to you at once.
 
Thanks for your interest in helpinq me, who just turned 83 years old, to
 
publish material that I should have published 20 years ago.
 
Sincerely,
 
W. M. Peck

 f
an o
f D

liver Sachs and envies you t
he chance o
f
 
meeting h
im. He must be a
 wonderful person.
 
Seldom  have I felt so self-confident and grateful at the same time as T have
 
been feeling since your letter arrived several hours ago.  Yes, of  course, T
 
remember  you  very  well  for I was similarly stimulated by the comments you
 
made when you came here in the early 80s. But before  I discuss  my  current
 
l
iterary  efforts, I will  bring  you  up-to-date  on  my present situation.
 
Barbara, my wife, died several years ago.  I am now 82 years old and  bealt1ly
 
enough  to  go  on  rapid three mile hikes every morning, though I did have a
 
pace maker installed a year ago. Even so I ran for about a blocIr this morning
 
during my walk.
 
And now about my writing.
 I think that my poetry writing days are now  gone
 
forever  but  I continue to write articles for local publications and I enjoy
 
helping local politicians prepare their devastating speeches.  I don't  tbinl�
.
 
I showed  you  the  translations  I had  made of ancient Trukese (
Chuukese)
 
poems.that  the  University  of  Guam  is  now  in  process  of
 publishing.
 
Unfortunately the first completed ones have such poor bindings that they must
 
be  redone.  I am  enclosinrT one of these poorly finished pamphlets and hope
 
that you enjoy its contents.
 
The partially completed book-manuscript that you saw '
has been  comnleted  an0
 
has  been accepted by the University of Guam and I am now making revisions to
 
give the various  chapters  continuity  and  to  empbasize  several  unifying
 
themes.  I have included only several poems anc

Dr. Oliver  Sachs, the  autlior  of The Aw* =inqs and T
"he Man
 Mistoo-[
�
� '
h
i
 
Wh o
 
Wife for a Hat visited me. He is a neurologist  and  had  come  to  Guam  to
 
consult  T
1
.
1
ith  a neurologist  friend of mine who then brought '
him to Rota to
 
meet me.  He was here for only a short  time  but  he  read' rapidly  tbrouq1
, 
portions  of  the  manuscript exclaiming as he went, "This must be nublis
"he( ,,
 
This  must  be  published,"  and  '
he  offered  to  help  f
ind  a
 publisher.
 
Unfortunately  I had  already made a commitment.  I found Sachs to be a very
 
pleasant nerson, -his interests in music and l
iterature coinci0inq wit-h mine.
 
He plays the keyboard and enjoyed my harpsichord.
 
I am, of  course f delighted  to  !mow that YOU may visit Rota next year.  By
 
then I hope things will be under control.  If not I will most certainly  turn
'
 
to you for help; as it is, I am taking very seriously the several suggestion ,
-,
 
you  have made and am planning to reread the manuscript with your sugr
 
in mind.
 j
estions
 
I am enclosing Montaingne's Introduction to his  Essays  which  expresses  my
 
current  expectations, and  also the Introduction that i
llustrates the t
'�
-emes
 
that I want to emphasize in the text.
 
Yes, my address is the same as it was when you were -
here.
 
I shall  start  with  a chanter, Cultural  Adaptation, that I once gave
 
speeches to prepare newcomers  for  the  shock  and  joy  and  adventure
 
existence  on  small  Pacific  islands  and  then I
'll include articles th
 
record details of bomb testing as I participated in  them  in  the  Marsha
 
Islands  (
glorious  when  they  occurred but painful now to reconstitute a
 
impossible to justify), and then s
l�etches of my adventures in Guam  w1l
ere
 
l
ived  through  the  worst  typhoon  ever recorded up to that time.  Afric
 
where I spent three years, I shall try to reduce to island size by includi
 
just one short description and a poem.  Then I shall include  six  years
 
adventures  in the old, now-defunct Trust Territory, and an account of thr
 
-
 -
. And at this point, now
 
I should add that I have had two purposes in  writing  A  Tidy  Universe  of
 
Islands:  Number One, to put down on paper the adventures on Pacific Islands
 
that  have thrilled and awed me and that I want to share with my friends and
 
relatives (
just as Montaigne wanted to share his Essays); and NUmber  Two, I
 
want  to  cite  incidents that affirm the honor and dignity and soundness of
 
traditional ways of life that, over many centuries, '
have been s
lowly crafted
 
and adapted to the essentials for survival on  these  isolatec
', starl�, ror'-y
 
islands;  for  it was here that I first came to understand that cultures are
 
usually fundamentally sound for situations in whicli they have  been  create,:
q
 
and should be respected, and that the term '
uncivilizeCl should be used with
 
Montainqne's Introduction to  is Essays
 
Reader, this is an honest hook.
 It warns you at the very outset that in it I
 
have  set  for  myself no other goal than a domestic and orivate one.
 
I
 
given no consideration in it either to  your  service  or  to  my  eLory.  My
 
powers  are  not capable of such an aim.
 I have dedicated it to the personal
 
use of my relatives and friends, so that when they have lost me  (which  they
 
must soon do), they may find
, again some traits of my habits and humor and may
 
by  this means keep more intact and more alive the knowledge they
 have had of
 
me.  If I had intended to seek the favor of the world, I should have  adorned
 
myself  better  and should present myself in a studied hearino.
 I wish to be
 
seen in my simple, natural, and ordinary fashion, without effort or artifice,
 
for it is myself that I portray.  My defects will here he read to  the  l
ife,
 
and  my  natural form, as far as respect for the public has permitted.  Had I
 
lived among those nations which are said to live still in the  sweet  liberty
 
of the first laws of nature, I assure you I should very gladly have portrayec
 
myself here at full length and entirely naked.  Thus, reader, I am myself the
 
matter  of  my  book; there is no reason for you to spend your e
leasure on so
 
frivolous and vain a subject.
 So farewell, from Montaigne, this first c
1ay of
 
March, fifteen hundred and e
ighty.

I finally had the good fortune to meet Dr.  Peck.
 He gave a
 
talk to a class I'm taking on Micronesian History.
 It was
 
delightful.
 He read excerpts from an autobiography he is
 
writing- anecdotes from his introduction to life on th
-e
 
Rongalap in the Marshalls,  advice he gave to newly arrived
 
physicians to Micronesia,  and talked about some of the other
 
books he has written.
 One book,  called Storyboard 2, is his
 
poetic translation of the Chuukese New Testament which was
 
given to him by a Chuukese close friend who felt that this
 
oral material should be shared with the world rather than
 
kept in secret by a small elite society in Chuuk.
 His book,
 
I Speak the Beginning, was especially exciting to me because
 
it was a document of Chamorrita songs he has recorded in
 
Rota,  then had literally translated.
 He then put the words
 
back into English poetic verse.
 I haven't found a copy of
 
either of these books yet,  but I'm still looking.
 I spoke
 
to him of your wish to get in touch with him,  and he said
 
you had written.
 He wrote a chapter for a book you are
 
working on,  and said he is anxious to know if you are going
 
to use it.
 He's 83 years old,  and except for being hard of
 
hearing,  is very well.
 I told him of my interest in
 
Chamorrita songs,  and he invited me to come to Rota and
 
listen to his recordings.
 I plan to take him up on it.
 
I've entered the graduate program for Micronesian Studies
 
which began this fall at the University of Guam.
 Included
 
is a syllibus for your information.
 I'm taking History of
 
Micronesia from Dr.  Dirk Ballendorf and Geography of
 
Micronesia from Dr.  Harley Manners.
 Both are challenging
 
and interesting.
 My M.A.  is in Home Ec,  which doesn't h
 
much application to my work at CAHA.
 So I felt this
 
best way to pursue an eventual Ph.D.

Gef Pa'go Chamorro Cultural Village has been operating for
 
almost a year now.
 It's progressing very well,  thanks to a
 
dedicated board of directors and a very competent,
 
resourceful staff.
 As with all new operations,  adequate
 
funding is a problem.
 Tourism has slowed considerably
 
because of the Japanese recession and our spate of typhoons.
 
We were just getting the numbers back up when the August 8th
 
earthquake scared visitors away again.
 The Guam Visitor's
 
Bureau has decided that Guam must promote its culture as a
 
unique destination  (finally)  and they are promoting Gef
 
Pa'go in all their off-island promotions.
 They have taken
 
the Taotao Tano dancers  (including the high school students
 
trained in our AlE program)  on promotional trips to Japan,
 
Korea,  and Taiwan.
 I wrote a grant application for them to
 
the Administration for Native Americans for $90,000 and we
 
just learned that it has been awarded.
 That,  plus the
 
$50,000 awarded from NEA Underserved Communities,  is a most
 
welcome addition to the Gef Pa'go budget for  '94.
 
On my return from Fife in June,  Merrie Carol,  Johnny and I
 
traveled home via the Island Hopper.
 We stayed two days in
 
Majuro,  three days in Pohnp& ,  and a day in Chuuk.
 At each
 
stop we paid visits to officials whom we thought could serve
 
as points of contact for future joint projects.
 I
 
especially mentioned the proposed canoe conference we are
 
planning for February  (pending funding).
 We hope to bring a
 
canoe builder and chaperone  (preferably someone in
 
government who can get things moving)  to come to Guam to
 
discuss ways to promote canoe activities for the next four
 
years.
 The ultimate goal will be for all participants to
 
have a canoe at the next Festival of Pacific Arts in Western
 
Samoa.
 Rob Limtiaco and Gary Guerrero are currently
 
building an ocean-going canoe here.
 They have formed a non-
profit organization called T. A.S.I -
 Tradition About
 
Seafaring Islands.
 
I will be attending the NASAA conference in Charleston
 
November 17-21,  thanks to scholarship assistance from the
 
Southern Arts Federation.
 I won't be able to attend the AFS
 
meeting,  unfortunately.
 
I hope your interests bring you to Guam someday soon.
 Its
 
nice and warm here in February.

Dear Bess Lomax Hawes:
 
January 31,  1994
 
I have just run across your letter of April,  1993 and it occurs to
 
me  that  I  should  bring  you  up  to  date  on  the  status  of  my
 
manuscript for A Tidy Universe of Islands.
 I answered your letter
 
by  rhapsodizing  on  my  information  and  expectation  that  the
 
University of Guam would be able to follow through on its promise
 
to publish the book.
 This satisfied my aspirations and I awaited
 
publication with enthusiasm and faith.
 Unfortunately the economy
 
of the University slowly deterriorated and the Legislature of Guam
 
finally instructed the University's editor that he must cease all
 
publication.
 That is where I stand now.
 I did contact an editor
 
at the University of Iowa's press.
 She spoke encouragingly of the
 
material but lamented that a book dealing with the Western Pacific
 
would not attract state-side readers.
 I contacted Bess Press in
 
Honolulu,  but made the mistake of  admitting that  I had  included
 
some  of  my poetry  and  the  editor  replied  that  Bess  Press  never
 
published poetry.
 
To prepare for a more extensive attempt of finding a publisher,  I
 
have purchased a computer, which I have learned to operate and I am
 
now prepared to send a compact disk of the manuscript to anyone who
 
is interested in it.
 I am writing to you, especially with this in
 
mind,  and,  if you are still  interested  in seeing the  final much
 
revised,  extended version of the manuscript,  I will be very happy
 
to send you a compact disk.
 
I note with enthusiasm,  as  I reread your  letter,  that you might
 
come to the CNMI for a visit.
 I seem to have missed this statement
 
in your letter when I received it.
 This I would value very, very
 
highly,  and I would take advantage of it by asking your advice on
 
many matters.  It would be much better than my merely sending you a
 
compact disk,  though I will be happy to do that at once.
 
Just one after-thought.
 It seems to me that public attention is
 
once again being aroused by bomb testing issues, especially by the
 
possibility that radiation was deliberate and for scientific and
 
medical evaluation.
 That might give some renewed interest in the
 
area.
 
As ever,

The f

John, t

at t

worried about t

long t

Once he noted a

d

 The possibility
 
t

might be r
elated never o
ccurred t

And t

As  I had  mentioned  to  Mrs.  Hawes,  I was  personally most
 
interested  in  your  project,  for  I feel  it  is more  timely  than  ever,
 
and  you  clearly  nrc  the  only  person  who  can  write  this  particular  ac-
count.
 
The difficulty  is  that  your  requirements do  not  fit  any  of  the
 
funding  programs  currently  supported  by  the Literature Program.
 
I would  suggest  you  encourage  the  University of  Guam to  apply  for
 
writer-in--residence  position  in  your  name.
 We  would  then  be able  to

 However,  t e  residency
 
rcat  could  not  be  applied  toward  your  travel  to  Washington.
 
A second  possibility  is  that  you  contact  the  Consortium  for  Pacific
 
Arts  and  Cultures,  which also  serves  Guam,  American  Samoa  and  the  Nurth-
ern  Marianas.
 In  case  you  don't  have  the  information,  our  records  show
 
their  address  as
 
Ms.  Bernice Mataname,  Program  Coordinator
 
Ms.  Ann  Teregyo,  Chairman

They might  be able  to  fund  your  project  directly,  or  they could
 
apply for  a residency  in  your  name.
 
After  talking  it  over  with Mary MacArthur,  the Assistant  Director
 
of  the Literature  program,  who  also  expressed  her  personal  enthusiasm
 
for  your  writing,  these were  the  best  possibilities  for  support  of
 
your  project  that  we were  able  to  come up  with.
 
Please let me  know  if  there  is anything more  I could do  personally
 
to  further  your  work on  this  important  undertaking.
 And  if  you  do  de-
cide  to  come  to  Washington,  please  drop  by and  see us;  we might  be  able
 
to  help  with  suggestions  for  professional  representation,  publishing
 
possibilities,  etc.
 
Once again,  the  best  of  luck,  and  please  forgive our  delay  in
 
responding  to  your  letter.
