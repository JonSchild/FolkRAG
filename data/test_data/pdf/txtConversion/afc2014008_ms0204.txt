SUBJ WT:  Foreign P
articiration in t
he Festival
 
i
t i
s t
ime for a r
eview of our procedures for api:
-roaching f
oreign
 
countries about participation in the: "Old i
:ays" program
, of the Festival.
 
I
le have absortred, t
o s
co
re degree, the lesso r of 1974:  the failure of
 
Ghana to ,
arrive, the late arrival of Nigeria.  However.,  I am not con-
vinced t
he Festival s
taff yet appreciates the continuing
: reverberations of
 
our fail-re t
o handle t
he Tunisian progrwn bffectively
 
.It is clear t
o
 
me t
hat 36 foreign n
ations in 1976 will make a shambles of our systems,
 
p
rocedures and n
erves i
f w
ee d
o not give greater t
hought t
o t
hose l
essons
 
and develop n
ew approaches based on that exrx-rience.
 
As an outgrowth of t
he 197h experience, in October of l
ast year I
 
prepared a set o
f procedures (
bnclosed) for cooperation between the State
 
Department m d DFA t
o ensure a Mora c
onsistent approach to foreign nations.
 
These procedures.
, based upun my t
y
ro f
tM a h
;
-lf month experience with t
he
 
Fostival at that t
in�,
,havc not stood up to experience and s
crutiny.
 
Thero are t
r
:ree major flaws in the October 1971 proc ures.  F
irst,
 
t
i,ey assume that invited countries w
aill give an official c
ommitrent t
o
 
participate before field work h
as be ,.
.
 n completed and the s
ug;-ested troure
 
s
elected.  For the most part, our descriptions of the Festival, i
ts o
bjectives
 
and successes, h
ave not moved t
he invited countries to accept o
ur offer.
 
I think it can now be accepted as a general principle that our field worker
 
must travel t
o t
he invited country, complete the survey and present his/
 
her c
onclusion:: t
o both the Smithsonian and t
he invited c
ountry's c
i
lltural
 
office, before serious d
iscussion can begin.  r
this principle presuppc s
e
's that
 
field workers must get o
ut t
o the field months earlier than t
hey have in
 
t
he past.
 
The second flaw in the (
October 1
974 memo was my failure to realize
 
that the folklore c
onsu=ltant cannot !
-
e divorced from t
he n
egotiating
 
process.  My a
scumptions were t
hat folklorists.
, since they are n
ot trained
 
a
s n
egotiators and have only a limited amount of tLme
> to complete their
 
work.
, s
hould c
oncentrate on their area of competence.  The Cultural Affairs
 
Officer of the A
r
reric.n ?mbassy, I reasoned, c
Gotild negotiate the conclusions
 
he/she received from our folklore consultant.  This year's experience
_ has
 
shown t
hat t
his d
i
.visie
.n of l
abor i
s i
mpossible.  The Festival's narrow
: :
end
 
precise criteria regoire professional explanation, if they are to be accepted
 
by per.-ons outside
s the field of f
olklore.  Caly a folklorist c
an field the
 
myriad questions generated when a suggested troupe i
s presented t
o a
 
particular 1
L

inistry of Culture for approval.  Altlloug
;h the folilorist cannot
 
be divorced from the n
egotiation process, the m
ole o
` the Cultur=
.:1 Affairs
 
Officer h
as not d
iminished.  His or her support i
s essential t
o the success
 
of this program.

The most critical flag in t
he October procedures i
s t
wat the i
ssue
 
of review and possible rejection of field work was not s
ufficiently thought
,
 
t
hrough.  I
t i
s clear t
hat the Smithsonian must retain c
ontrol of presentation
 
quality at t
he Festival--but how that control i
s exercised is at i
ssue.
 
In the future, if we are t
o reject s
ome or all of a f
olklore c
onsultant's
 
c
onclusions, we r
oust be r
eady to send s
omeone immediately t
o t
he invitee
 
c
ountry t
o p
ick u
p t
he pieces,  L
ebanon this year i
s my c
nso in point.
 
More i
mportnn is t
he field work must be c
ompleted c
onsiderably e
arlier than
 
i
n the p
ast, the c
onclusions reviewed more e
xpeditiously, and i
f t
he Festival
 
staff feels the c
onclusions do n
ot meet its criteria, that d
ecision must
 
be transmitted t
o the invited c
ountry's embassy and t
o the American Embassy
 
according t
o  accepted protocol.  Either I or the International Programs
 
Office will give g
uidance on protocol.
 
The most serious flaw, however, lies outside t
he s
teps listed in th e
 
October procedures.  The Festival staff has not .
fully g
rasped that decisions
 
based on f
olklore are not made in a vacuum.  R

g
etting intricately involved with t
he bureaucracies--and often t
he elites--
of the invited c
ountries as well as with t
he Stabe Department and U
.S.I.A.
 
The villain of t
his piece, of this analysis, i
s r
apid change and
 
growth.  The Festival has shifted t
oo rapidly from a s
mall, containable
 
program t
o a presentation t
hat would t
ax John R

personalized procedures d
eveloped in pre-Bicentennial d
ays are s

breaking dorm.  In 1973 i
t was p
ossible t

lukewarm fashion.  Then we ask the invited c
ountry to pay not an insignificant
 
p
ercentage of the c
ostss-and we stipulate thnt a "
'Mithsonion
. representative
 
must travel t
o t
he country to salect participants, albdAt in cooperation with
 
invited ration scholars.  Final acceptance/rejection remains
. with t
he
 
Smithsonian.  Particularly in developing countries and countries worried
 
about t
heir international image, this i
s a fairly weak bargaining position.
 
We enter into the cultual s
overeignty of a particular n
ation ! refuse
 
Pahkafed folk groups, and s
elect what we dotermine are v

It might not b

E

aid a

nd shepherds
 
c
omes to mind.  With developgd, industrialised countries we face the
 
problem of cornne rc
ialiaation'and the general preference for classical
 
cultur e
 
'
.
.
'hat T
ve're trying to do cannot be done.-but we'll do it.  h
'e'll d
c
:
 
it if v
ie can sat our house in order, begin everything earlier, a
nd s
peed
 
up the decision proce-s.  The as-3gnrent of a folkloriot to the "
Old `
.
-
.
`
ays"
 
staff and the establishment
  of an advisory board give ma c
onsiderablc hope
 
that our decision
,/action log jam can be broken.
 
Everything hangs on the selection of the folklore c
onsultant assigned
 
to do field work; in a particular country.  All a&ainistrative back-up,
 
mine i
ncluded, is of little use until the folklore c
onsultant gives the
 
program focus.  We must select con
ipetent folklore consultants who have the
 
confidence of all c
oncerned, and they should be specialists in the countries
 
they visit, if at all possible.  There i
sn't the time or money to train
 
generalists to deal with the peculiarities of a r
•
articular c
ountry's culture.
 
For i
nstanc:;, t
he folklore c
onsultant must k
now if a particular ethnic
 
or tribal group has political control in a country and how to &,il with
 
that fact--Cf
iana, case in point.  Fifteen days' field worm can hardly b
e
 
called r
esearch.  The field worker must bring with him or her extensive
 
knovledCo of the c
ulture in question and solid contacts in the country's
 
scholarly c
ar
.:
 n
i
.nity, if he or she is to accomplish what we ask.
 
Finally, we need scholarly evidence of t
he Festival's accon
,pli:;hments--
 
j
ournal articles, r
ecords--to u
se in convincing
. foroign cultural repre-
s
entatives of the restival's l
asting value.  Most of our arglar
ients are based
 
in public relations -135,C00 people c
ame on July l
a
th---or are e
 .trerlely
 
vague,
 
Much o
f our creative energy this fiscal year h
as been spent in a
 
manichaean faculty-versus-administration, artist/scientist-versu3 administration
 
confrontation.  If we can at least c
ontain tht
.
- is- ue, we

o
 
do this impossible ,

MEMORANDUM
 
August 20,  1976
 
TO
 John Jameson
 
FROM
 Ralph Rinzler
 
SUBJECT:  New Folklife Program at the Smithsonian Institution
 
As you suggested it might be helpful, I have drafted this memo to
 
recapitulate and clarify parts of our conversation of Monday, August 16th.
 
In the process, I have added or simply re-emphasized, perhaps,  (
I am not sure
 
I remember every point we touched upon), matters of particular programmatic
 
concern to me.
 
The scope of the program suggested in our Planning Documents  (including
 
the subsequent July 30 memo and proposed publication list) is clearly something
 
that appropriately concerns you and other Assistant Secretaries.
 Yet, I do
 
not see how we can accomplish the proper objectives of such a program (and
 
what I expect the Secretary expects of it) by seriously diminishing that scope.
 
The Library of Congress is beginning a program with a staff of eight and a
 
budget of $300,000, whereas it has at least been suggested to us that we can
 
continue a program (
involving the accumulation of ten years of valuable
 
experience -- almost none of it reviewed -- and the expenditure of many millions
 
of dollars) with a staff of two folklorists and one secretary.
 Bob and I have
 
considered this suggestion from eve ry conceivable professional perspective,
 
and still conclude that we cannot make do with less than the minimal staff
 
specified in my memo to you of July 30.
 I should emphasize, however, that
 
the size of that staff perhaps appears more imposing than it actually is.
 
Of the six listed in our memo of July 30, only two (
Bob and myself) are Career
 
employees, one appointment  (
that of Frank Proschan, the Archivist) is in-
tended for one year only, and with the possible exception of Thomas Vennum,
 
the ethnomusicologist, the other three are not necessarily permanent and would
 
remain on staff only as long as the needs of the program and their own cap-
abilities justify it.
 Beyond this staff of six, we have listed only 8 people
 
who would be on contract solely for varying (
some of them relatively brief)
 
periods of time.
 
Certain reductions in total program cost can be effected, of course.
 
Recent developments (
the failure of HEW to come through with a contract for
 
video taping, the fixing of termination dates at November 30 for certain
 
of our contractors on current Bicentennial appointments, etc.) would allow
 
us to cut back total contract costs by about $7,000.
 In addition, our entire
 
equipment list (
budgeted at $27,000) consists of a portion of technical
 
equipment already purchased for folklife programs by the DPA, and no part of the $27,000
 
-2-
need be spent if this equipment can be assigned to the new folklife program
 
when it separates from DPA.
 The $4,000 we have budgeted for office supplies
 
and equipment could be considerably reduced in the same fashion.
 Beyond this,
 
Bob and I do not see any possibility of cutting.
 
My conversation with you also revealed that our Planning Documents do
 
not make sufficiently clear how the activities of the past, those projected
 
for FY 1977, and those for FY 1978 are linked in a three phase continuum
 
of (
1) the accumulation of experience and data,  (
2)  the analysis and dis-
semination of what we have learned, and (
3) the application of that knowledge
 
in innovative museum presentation and training programs.
 Thus, e
.g., the
 
experience and data of Working Americans gathered during the conceptualization
 
and presentation of occupational folklore in our Festivals can be handled as
 
follows:
 
1
.
 Written up by contracting specialists Seitel and Shore in FY 1977.
 
2
.
 These monographs will be Dublished by us in FY 1978.
 
3
.
 In the same year they will be applied in a living museum presentation
 
associated with an SI museum (
probably MHT).
 
4
.
 This presentation will include a training program for innovative
 
museologists.
 
Both Paul Perrot and the AASLH (
American Association for State and Local
 
History) have already expressed interest in this idea, and the AASLH could
 
almost certainly be relied upon for collaboration and perhaps funding as
 
well.
 Our plans for the development of past programs in ethnicity (Old Ways
 
in the New World), Black culture (African Diaspora), and Family Folklore also
 
embody this same three phase continuum.
 
The above, as I understand it, responds directly to one of the Secretary's
 
concerns.
 You will recall from Monday's conversation, that Mr.  Ripley had
 
posed the question, "Why, if our Festivals are so well received, have other
 
museums not followed our example?"  My response was that we had developed
 
expertise and now were charged with sharing and disseminating what we had
 
learned.
 This can be accomplished most effectively by following up publication
 
with presentation designed for public enlightenment and also used as a
 
training model for a group of recruited trainees who would be enrolled in a
 
course given here by our staff during the presentation.
 The course would
 
use the presentation as an operating example o
f the type of living museum
 
program which the course is set up to proliferate.
 In short, the presentation,
 
a kind of mini-festival, will be at once a public event and an interactional
 
training laboratory.
 
Our programming of Native American cultures, on the other hand, calls
 
for a complete reassessmcnt; and in FY 1977 we have plans for that reassess-
ment to be undertaken by the most eminent Native American anthropologist in
 
the country.
 
-3-
I would also like t
o emphasize at this point the importance to our plans
 
of the files (
photographs, correspondence, fieldwork reportF) and documentation
 
of 10 Festivals presently stored.in the DPA; in fact, the implementation of
 
our plans is absolutely dependent upon immediate and easy access to (
hence,
 
possession of) those files and materials.
 I am very concerned, tnerefure,
 
that they remain intact and be transferred in their entirety to the juris-
diction of the folklife program on September 7
, 1976.
 
You also expressed interest in the relationship we envision (and in
 
part have already discussed) with the Library's new Folklife Center, in
 
addition to its well established Archive of Folk Song, and the two Endow-
ments.
 Recent discussions have underscored the desirability and importance
 
of a long-range (
i.e., ten-year) tripartite plan which would set out the
 
objectives and responsibilities of our three institutions in keeping with
 
our mandates.
 Such a cooperative operational plan would address the needs
 
f
or folklife programsthroughout the U
.S. and would be designed to work sys-
tematically towards long-range objectives at scholarly and popular levels.
 
The attached excerpt from a May 6
, 1976 memo to Julian prepared by Bob, Bess
 
and myself provides the framework of one type of collaborative effort already
 
discussed with colleagues at NEA and the Library of Congress. I
t is not the
 
only such joint endeavor we might undertake but represents the type of approach
 
we think might be fruitful for all of the participating institutions.
 
It was gratifying to learn from your comments Monday that I can expect
 
a response on budget questions by August 30. If Bob and I can be helpful in
 
reviewing any of this with you and Julian in the next ten days, please call
 
on us.

Dear Dr. Mead:
 
My brother, A
lan Lomax, has told me t
hat you have k
indly
 
consented to contribute an article to t
he 1
976 Smithsonian F
estival
 
of American Folklife program book.  This particular edition w
ill be,
 
we hope, a gala affair, and we are t
hus particularly happy about your
 
participation.  We expect t
hat t
his year Festival v
isitors w
ill buy
 
t
his book not only as a program guide but a
lso a
s a souvenir of t
he
 
B
icentennial to be preserved for t
heir grandchildren; t
hus, we are
 
p
lanning an extremely s
izeable printing (
first printing:  1
00,000).
 
I
 enclose a tentative table of contents for your i
nterest.
 
A
lan has a
lso told me t
hat he t
hought you would appreciate my
 
preparing a draft article t
hat you could edit to your own style.
 I
n
 
searching for how best to do this,  I came across t
he 1
975 Redbook
 
article i
n which you d
iscussed our Festival.  The entire tone and
 
content of t
hat article seems to me and t
he other Festival d
irectors
 
exactly what we should l
ike for our book, so I have t
aken t
he l
iberty
 
of editing i
t down to f
it our space r
equirements and substituting a
 
f
ew paragraphs containing more up to date i
nformation on our p
lans
 
for t
he 1
976 Festival.
 I
f t
his solution meets w
ith your approval, we
 
w
ill of course write Redbook for permission and w
ill arrange for a
 
proper statement of credit.
 
The draft I prepared from your article i
s enclosed.
 I
 would
 
greatly appreciate i
t i
f you would r
e-edit i
t i
n any way you would l
ike
 
and r
eturn i
t to me as soon a
s possible, a
long w
ith, i
f you agree, a
 
photograph of yourself which we could print a
long w
ith your article.

The Festival of American Folklife i
s a case in point.  The festival will take place
 
on the mall during the summer of 1
976, in the green and open space between the
 
Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.  Pierre L
'Enfant, who designed the
 
capital, called the Mall the "axis of the nation".  In a sense this national festival
 
also is an axis.  For the people taking part in i
t are gathering from a
ll over our
 
country and many foreign lands, and once i
t i
s over, they will s
tream away to other
 
festive celebrations.
 
In the year of 1
976, Native Americans are coming to Washington from every area of
 
the country, celebrating their ways of l
iving both in the l
ost past and in the
 
modern world.  Ethnic Americans of the most diverse cultural heritages will join
 
together with their contemporaries from the lands of their cultural origin; B
lack
 
Americans will celebrate with their cultural cousins from Africa and the New World.
 
Working Americans will focus on the pride, the skills and the traditions particular
 
to the countless ixdxxtrixxx occupations which support and make productive our land.

Dear Dr. Ripley:
 
I read with great interest your "View from the Castle" with regard to
 
the American Folklife Festival..  It is yet another appreciative essay on the
 
subject from your pen that I have seen from time to time in the annual folklife
 
festival
 
This year I am somewhat distressed to learn that the Smithsonian Institu-
tion may pass its effective sponsorship of folklife festivals to other agencies,
 
inside the government and out, that are willing to build upon the foundations
 
that have been laid over the past dozen years or no.
 
2
, for one, would certainly hope that the Smithsonian would contitm
,e to
 
keep the American Folklife Festival within its range of concerns, leaving to
 
other groups the sponsorship of state and regional festivals and other expressions
 
of the American folk spirit.
 
I hope that b
efore y
ou g
ive up the idea of same sort of aI
Inmial folklife
 
festival in the City of Washington, you will certainly talk the whole situation
 
over very carefully with Nancy Hanks of the National Endo ment for the Arts and
 
Alan Jabbour of the American Folklife Center.  Both of these agencies will be
 
willing to help out in some way, I a
re sure, but I do not think that either one
 
is equipped to do the job the Smithsonian has done so ably for a
ll these years.
 
Perhaps this matter can be discussed at the meeting of the Board of Trustees of
 
the American Folklife Center at its meeting in Any.  This will be an occasion
 
for representatives of all interested-Varties w
ould be present to consider the
 
matter in a deliberate way.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Wayland D. Rand, Chairman

Dear ,
Best:
 
The attaches letter was written for
 
Kate. This first part of it seems as
 
appropriate for y
 u as fQ  her, and
 
so I send the cop�
i No A
f
f you in a
 
bit more on how things are going. I
 
come alive once work involves people
 
like you and Alan and Lopes-Graga
 
whom I hope you will meet this summer.
 
How to thank you for the support you
 
provided before my departure. Once away
 
from D.C., I take stock of how madly my
 
mind works in the unhealthy atmosphere
 
of our office.  Unhealthy, at least,  for
 
me.
 
You must be quite frank with me about
 
how things work for you in my absence.
 
I am confident that what I can accom-
plish on this trip can only be done
 
by me,as I
've worked with the USIS
 
people and folklorists and know what
 
to do and how. Nonetheless, If  this
 
absence makes problems on the home front
 
I can surely rearrange things and cur-
tail some if not all further travel. i
jc
.,
 
will wd &� this out on the basis of your
 
own evaluation of the situation. In some
 
ways,  it might be easier when  I
'm away
 
because I am so myopic about some thing:
 
that I constantly tend to polarize and
 
that's clearly unproductive not to men-
tion unpleasant. For that I apologize.
 
For your contributions -intellectual,
 
creative  stabilizing,
 political - I
 
will always owe you a deep debt. With-
out your presence, this year would be
 
impossibly difficult. I only hope it
 
is worthwhile for you, and will count

i
Th s trip is, in a way, nicer than the last '
an the fall
-warm weather is
 
very beautiful and, though I have very little time free,  it is '
nice to be
 
able to walk about Lisbon and Hadttd with shirt sleeves in the balmy air.
 
I arrived in Lisbon having flown all night with only four hours sleep the
 
night before I left and two hours sleep on'tbe plane.  I went straight, to
 
the embassy and met with people, then had a two-hour nap and went to visit
 
Portugal's collector-composer, 70 yr. old Fernando Lopes-Graaa. A gentle,
 
kind man of great power who, since his youth, was living as a conounist
 
in a fascist state. He was imprisoned in 1931 and again in 1936 ,finally
 
fleeing to France for two years and returning-on the eve of-W.W. II. Like
 
Bartok, he early took an- interest in folk song and began to collect in
 
the field.  He used some of the themes in his own compositions and also
 
set the texts of topical underground Portuguese poets to song in addition
 
to doing setting$for piano and voice of black American spirituals concen-
trating on the themes of deliverance from oppression into freedom.  While
 
the settings are recorded by operatic singers singing in black dialect in
 
English (
the singers are Portuguese, mind you - imagine)  accompanied by
 
piano,
 the meaning is significant.
 I have taped some of the settings (
they, 
are modern and agreeable) to be polite, but the performance, while accept-
able for non-English speakers who may have a penchant for bel canto singing,
 
is hard to take
—especially if you've heard anything black other than
 
Marian Anderson and Paul Robeson.
 
Nonetheless,  that was a lesson in cultural relativity.
 He is such a superb
 
man, that one understands where he's coming from, what he's been through,
 
and how remarkable it is that he's survived a lifetime of underground crea-
ting to now be celebrated  (
since April 25,  1974) as the most significant
 
composer of h
is beloved country. His picture is in every record store, he
 
walks in and everyone wants him to sign the recordings of his wor s
,s of his
 
symphonic pieces  (mostly recorded by Eastern European Socialist  ymphonies
 
and his own choral group of young people whom he has trained for years
 
sub rosa right in Lisbon.
 His field recordings are masterpieces.  They
 
were done in conjunction with an ethnologist who is about my age, was born
 
in Corsica,  educated in Paris and now lives in Lisbon. Michel Giacometti,
 
no relation to the late sculptor, was away during this visit, but I plan
 
to return to Lisbon enroute home because the govt. ministers resigned the
 
day before I left and they are in the process of setting up, alas, a Chris+
.
 
ian Democratic  (
probably, that is)  government in place of the Socialist
 
one which followed the revolution. There is too much struggling between
 
the communists and socialists, and they defeat their own purposes and end
 
up with an unsatisfactory compromise for both.
 In any case, Giacometti
 
is a brilliant photographer - like a super-inspired, unromantic John Cohen.
 
He captures the spirit,  vitality and vigor of the Portuguese peotble and
 
his pictures evoke a deep love for them one and all - especially when you
 
hear their music.
 
r
- L
 
is
 
Fado singing ,/known round the world as the music of Portugal, and prized
 
by Portuguese-American s  (you'll remember the family we met at Providence
 
airport while waiting for Paula and Colin - they both sing fado songs) who
 
seek to keep bold of their heritage.
 It is essentially a•cabaret style,
 
lush, romantic, with overtones of folk style both vocally and instrumentally.
 
Texts are primarily romantic if not exclusively.  The hard core revolution-
aries brusquely reject
 fado now recalling the night clubs in which it
 
flourished as entertainment for fascist leaders,  industrialists, bankers
 
and weiithy tourists - places which- working people could not afford to
 
frequent.
 
Lopes-Grata and giacometti have collected such splendid, gut solid material
 
that fado wouldn  4e by direct comparison.  There is gr and variet
y in  their
 
beautifully bound,  (
the covers are brown burlapa  six volume l.p.  set of
 
disc5issued in painfully small numbers, paid for by subscription, much of
 
it from Europe and overseas,  little from within Portugal.
 It is documented
 
with Giacometti's powerful photos, musicological commentary by  Lopes-Grata
 
and cultural commentary by Giacometti. Maps are missing and should be added
 
to a planned reissue as should historical commentary to provide perspective,
 
at aeast for us ignorant feriners. But the layout, design,  factual data (the
 
name and age,  not to mention town,  region, district etc.)  of almost every
 
informant including members of choral groups is provided. Thus, my favorite
 
performance  (
it'll make your hair stand on end - sounds like Macedonian
 
peasant women,  shrill, passionate,  sharp edged) which is done by a rather
 
large group (
about 12-15)  I know I can some day hear in person as it was
 
recorded about ten yrs. ago and some of the singers were then in their 20's
 
and 30's. It moves from monody to small group unison then to a startling
 
harmonic burst with parallel fourths and major seconds wailed out fall tilt.
 
Sounds like 13th century choral music - Perotin and Dufay- with an injection
 
of strong insulin. One knock-out feature: the second verse is sung 1/2 step
 
higher in pitch than the first and the third drops 1 1/2 steps below the
 
second.
 For some inexplicable reason, G-L was disturbed when I remarked at
 
this admiringly saying it might have been a fault in the recording equipment
 
or was perhaps edited together from several performances. He hadn't been at
 
that field recording session. Either,  as a trained, professional musician
 
he takes exception to it or  he misinterprets my reaction. He cautioned me,
 
when I exclaimed at it, that one mustn't theorize too much - I had no theory
 
on hand for that one .
.. it just�,delighted and astounded me. Them he pointed
 
out that he had made the same observation in his notes in Portuguese, and
 
dismissed the subject.  We can communicate effortlessly as he speaks perfect
 
French, having sought asylum there on several occasions. Even
 after
 two
 
nights with almost no sleep,  I stayed at his place until 51:30  (having arrive
 
in m
 
i
d
-afternoon and been deserted after 1/2 hou r b y the
 Xembassy people who
 
accompanied me, 40rtunately). We ate some cheese and listened avidly to music
 
for about eight hours. Then I had to make
 m y wa y back
 
to  Lisbon (40 minutes
 
by overland train along the coast)  at midnight.  I slept 10 hours and Chat-
accustomed me to the 5-hour time change tout de suite. Next day I was back
 
at noon and spent another 5 hours listening until he had
 to  leave
 to  go `
'4
 
a celebration of Bulgaria's national day in town. I did get some dis

 - onl

and some symphonic things to see how he differs from Bartok whom I k

of the other s

C
a hearty sounding bunch, almost like
�
Wraininn men with booming,  rich voice s
 
sings about the olive trees while they are shaking the branches so that the
 
olives fall on the tarpaulins which they've stretched to catch the fruit. Like
 
those Ligurian Italian farmers who sang at this summer's festival, these men
 
harmonize naturally,  inventivejy and very beautifully moving in and out of
 
unison.  I heard (and copied)  two different groups. Both are similar and it is
 
interesting to note the common features of that regional choral style. in Lopes-
Graca tends to favor the south  (
as it is politically distinctly left and con-
sistently so).
 He therefore was irritated at Joanne's "theory"  (
I believe it's
 
a fact, nonetheless)  that mainland Portuguese came mainly from the north to the
 
U.S. The static we were getting can,  I am quite convinced, be traced to the
 
discomfort socialist and communist figures in the government
 felt with:
 
1
)  the idea of sending only northerners who might be a bit more con-
servative politically than they feel comfortable with
 
2
)  the possible reaction of Port.-Americans to anything which the pre-
sent government would wish to send
 
The political scene is unpredictable here.
 It's just as well the key man I was
 
hoping to see was away. In fact,  it may be symptomatic. In any cas� Let'

question we can get a superb group from here - up to the quality of the Italia
 
material of this summer and at that level  (
i.e. no mixture of evolved, city
 
material). Fado may be included from the states, but, as I mentioned in the
 
door of your office when you, Tom and Susan were discussing the matter and you
 
posed the question to me , it is a cabaret tradition and I think we could do
 
without it and be better off for doing so. Especially if we bring the sort of
 
material I
've listened to for these two days. You'll see what I mean when you
 
hear the tapes. It would be a very whole picture and a comfortable one,  I think,
 
were your  al for is
 ople to come much as they did last summer, and do the
 
same musical
 mat`e r
vial enhanced,  if you wish, by some additional fieldwork. They
 
would complement and sound completely at home with what I
've heard here. Much
 
more interesting tb  have the foreign and U.S. things complement rather than
 
overlap when possible  especially so when immigration is relatively recent.  I
tt
 
allows for more variety and greater geographical stylistic representation. There':
 
a nice range of bagpipe styles here. Nothing as elegant as the cranning,  saucy
 
cant of the uilleann pipes with their sophisticated altering drones but rough
 
hewn,  straight forward instruments on which dance music sounds just right. There
 
is one terrif

s-piece which begins with a slightly syncopated bass d im solo and

Re:
 H
ispanic-American Week
 
The f
ollowing i
s a summary of a d
iscussion w
ith D
r. Arturo Warman
 
about t
he H
ispanic-American p
rogram week at AFS meeting, New Orleans,
 
October 2
4 and 2
5.
 
P
rofessor Warman, probably t
he n
icest man i
n t
he western hemisphere,
 
talked on a number of programmatic p
ossibilities,  i
ncluding ; at my
 
request, s
uggestions on areas other t
han Mexico proper.
 
SPAIN
 
Though most of t
he early Spanish explorers and settlers came t
o
 
t
he new world out of t
he Spanish p
rovinces of Castille a
nd Extremadura,
 
t
hey s
tayed i
n southern Spain before departure sometimes a
s l
ong a
s a
 
year.
 (
It t
ook a l
ong t
ime to make t
he journey south during t
hose days,
 
a
nd t
he f
leet was t
ypically months a
nd months l
ate; apparently t
he DPA
 
i
s not t
he only p
lace where deadlines don't get met.)  This s
ituation
 
resulted i
n t
heir acquisition of t
he Andalucian musical t
radition and
 
r
epertoire.  Thus i
n H
ispanic Mexico, t
he musical t
radition i
s l
argely
 
Andalucian r
ather t
han E
xtremaduran or Castillian.  This seems an
 
extremely i
mportant point f
or a
ll f
ield workers t
o bear i
n m
ind.
 
Warman r
ecommends s
trongly that Anna Lomax, before her r
eturn
 
from Spain, v
isit t
he Canary I
slands, l
argely settled b
y Africans a
nd
 
H
ispanic-American r
eturnees from Peru and Mexico during t
he 1
8th a
nd
 
l
9th centuries.  Thus t
heir music i
s c
losely r
elated both to Mexico
 
and t
he H
ispanic Caribbean.  The r
epertory i
ncludes many songs known
 
i
n t
he new a
nd t
he o
ld world, but C
anarian s
tyle i
s a b
it d
ifferent -
-
somewhere between t
he P
uerto R
ican seis a
nd t
he Mexican jarocho but
 
"not so bright -
- more soft and gentle".
 
Warman suggests bringing i
n one male and one f
emale copla s
inger
 
(
they t
ake t
urns, s
inging i
n solo but overlapping s
lightly on t
he l
ast
 
note) p
lus an accompanying musical ensemble of perhaps 5
 or so s
tring
 
p
layers.  They a
lso s
ing aguinaldos (
Christmas songs), a
nd t
here i
s a
 
dance t
radition which accompanies t
he coplas. 
P
rofessor Garcia-Matos
 
of Spain has done extensive r
esearch i
nto t
he music of t
he Canaries,
 
but unfortunately d
ied a year or so ago.  However, Warman i
s s
ure some
 
of h
is students would be available for advice and counsel.
 
-2-
ANDALUCIA
 
Warman f
eels i
t w
ill be very d
ifficult t
o get a Gypsy quadro to
 
represent t
he f
lamenco tradition, because so many of t
hem have gone
 
r
eally commercial.  H
is advice i
s t
o t
ry for a peasant r
ather t
han a
 
gypsy f
lamenco group; t
hey are not "as bright but s
till wonderful".
 
He a
lso s
uggests t
hat a s
ingle s
inger who can do t
he S
aetas (
Holy
 
Week song) be considered; no accompaniment on t
he guitar would be
 
u
sed for t
hese and we could l
eave out t
he brass band t
hat normally
 
preceeds t
he song.
 
What he r
eally t
hinks we should bring f
rom Andalucia are
 
campanilleros (
Christmas songs accompanied by bells and a f
riction
 
drum, z
amponia). These could be performed effectively, he t
hinks,
 
by a group of s
ix (
typically, young people, between t
he ages of 1
2
 
and 26 or so).  The song t
radition sung by t
hese f
olks i
s r
elated
 
to t
he P
uerto R
ican aguinaldos (
Christmas songs) and to t
he jarocho
  
aguinaldo sung i
n New Mexico.  He feels t
his i
s t
he c
learest cognate
 
tradition we can demonstrate and s
hould definitely be i
ncluded;
 
besides, t
hey are very beautiful.
 
CATALONIA
 
He r
ecommends skipping t
he Catalonians i
n Spain proper, a
s t
hey
 
d
id not emigrate t
o t
he new world u
ntil  t
he l
ate 1
8th century, and
 
t
here i
s t
hus no c

VALENCIA
 
He agrees w
ith Anna t
hat t
he a
leu en dos t

s e
specially
 
wonderful.
 
OLD CASTILLE
 
Again, he agrees w
ith Anna's r
ecommendations, adding only t
hat
 
t
here are charros t
here, which are r
elated to t
he Mexican charros. 
He says t
hey are good dancers b
ut there i
s not much a
ssociated music;
 
therefore t
here would be no point i
n bringing t
hem unless we p
lan to
 
i
nclude t
he c
harro t
radition i
n t
he new world.
 (
This essentially

i

DRAFT
 
Summary of discussions of first meeting of Old Ways in the New World
 
Advisory Committee on May 3
, 1975
 
Present:  Arensberg, Lomax, Jakobson, McAllester, Hawes, Morris, Rinzler
 
Lester, Cherkasky, Vennum, Belcher
 
Underlying Concepts for Old Ways in the New World:
 
If the "Old Ways" program wants help from the Advisory Committee, it
 
must take seriously the responsibility that it's assuming:  to make America
 
and the world conscious of the traditions here; and to exert the best
 
possible effect on those traditions themselves.  In working with scholars,
 
foreign  nations and American agencies,the Old Ways program must have credi-
bility.  Criteria should be stated clearly and adhered to.  How well this
 
goal is carried out will have long-term effects;  erosion of trust will
 
cause enormous damage.
 
The cognate concept has been useful as a rationale for not accepting
 
a choreographed or slick troupe that a nation might want to send;  but
 
using the concept as a cover doesn't increase credibility.  On the other
 
hand, the concept also may aid in the selection of traditions or
 
tradition-bearers to be presented.  Or it may cause problems if the field-
worker i
s short of time and yet attempts to adhere too closely to it.
 
Ralph said the cognate concept is valid only insofar as there are
 
good examples of the dynamic, living, performing tradition.  Cognates are
 
a point of departure;  not the ultimate goal.  Alan Lomax said that
 
fieldwork must go beyond cognates to find root materials;
 though other
 
material (
e.g. Novi Sad) may be used as "window dressing".  He said one
 
characteristic of our Festival of American Folklife presentations is that
 
it is not easy to figure out what the Smithsonian approves of.  Bess added
 
that "matched pairs" needn't be presented.  Svatava Jakobson pointed out that
 
presenting the old repertoire as well as American additions to it provides
 
interest for both Old World and New World participants.
 
Bess Hawes said that in using cognates, we must be aware of subdivisions
 
within political units;  American immigrant communities may feel no rela-
tionship to those who have come from overseas.  This may be especially true
 
when the foreign group is on tour.  Alan Lomax suggested that cultural
 
rather than national criteria be used and that we ask foreign governments
 
simply to help with bringing the tradition to the Festival.  An explanation
 
was given to the Advisory Committee of the proposals to nations for provision
 
of the transportation of their participants.
 
Concepts of celebration and community introduced.  Usefulness of these
 
concepts was considered.  Little discussion;  no conclusions reached as
 
to whether these concepts, whLch have been used to provide coherence and
 
unity, should continue to be basic to Old Ways.
 
• 
-2-
Administrative and Program Staffing
  
Alan Lomax stated that in the past the Festival has placed too much
 
emphasis on administration rather than fieldwork.  Good fieldwork is the
 
most difficult work that anyone can do.
 
Jim Morris responded that Old Ways has had mainly support staff in
 
the past.  He explained how Civil Service regulations have led to severe
 
staffing problems.
 
The Advisory Committee should advise on what kind of a program staff
 
is needed;  anthropologists, folklorists or ethnomusicologists,
 
specialists or generalists.
 
Alan Lomax recommeded that i
f the American academic community is asked
 
to participate in policy, there should be one person for them to deal with.
 
This person should be supported by an adequate administrative staff and should
 
have both responsibility and authority to develop a program and staff.
 
The program staff's first responsibility should be support and supervision
 
of fieldwork, and its translation into presentation.  The administrative
 
staff should be a back-up for a tremendous field operation;  the Old Ways
 
Advisory Committee also should be used as a back-up.  Lomax also suggested
 
that the Festival staff have a couple of high-level trouble-shooters on a
 
fulltime year-round basis (
perhaps one for Regional America, one for Old
 
Ways, one for European).  Bess should not have to devote all of her time
 
to administrative matters;  also should do trouble-shooting in the field.
 
A
 
Alan Lomax felt that until there is a clearly delineated staff for
 
policy-making  (
Bess and others), it is pointless to deal with potential
 
fieldworkers on the basis of names and addresses.  Pointless to have more
 
advice without a staff to carry it out;  a piece-meal approach as in the
 
past will not suffice.
 
Recruitment of Fieldworkers for Old Ways
  
Alan  Lomax pointed out that in planning to work with many more nations
 
for 1976, Old Ways needs to use the top academic channels to approach their
 
peers in foreign nations to discuss trategy;  any other method would be a
 
waste.  Since the foreign folklorist may be considered radical in his own
 
country, just as are folklorists here, such prestigeous American scholars
 
can back up and support the foreign scholar in the work he does for us.
 
It is essential to get to the right people quickly;  otherwise the field-
worker may be tied up in diplomatic work.
 
a
 
Each country needs
 ^different strategy, with a special organization
 
set up to "bear in" on each country's needs.  Any American who does overseas
 
fieldwork should have a network of friends in that country or at least
 
reliable contacts.
 
On, the other hand, everyone doing fieldwork
. dQesnAt
•. have. to be a
 
scholar, e
,g. someone like Brownie McGhee , Use of the Anthropological
 
Register was suggested by Dr. Arensberg, as well as contacting foreign
 
long-time scholars to be matched with younger U.S. scholars to work with
 
them.
 
i
 
r
 
-3-
Emphasis should be placed on allowing enough t
ime and money for
 
fieldwork:  think time and work time in the U
.S. and abroad.
 
Alan Lester pointed out that planning for the Learning Center also
 
requires access to people who really know the culture.
 
There is a real problem of communications in dealing with many field-
workers.  Each individual fieldworker needs much support and information,
 
and the support staff needs to be strengthened accordingly.
 
Trying to move on too many fronts (
music, dance, crafts, Learning
 
Center exhibits) may dissipate the energy of the fiel
,dwork�rs,
 
1976 fieldworkers should be invited to the 1975 Festival to observe,
 
learn and evaluate.
 
Overseas Follow-up Work
 
Alan Lester pointed out the need for someone to do follow-up work in
 
each country, receive and send cables, etc., pick up on all of the loose
 
ends, passports.
 
He suggested that diplomatic operations be -separate from the
 
fieldwork planning so that foreign participants can be selected by field-
workers and then presented to the foreg
gin government as a fait accompli,
 
thus avoiding government interference.
 
Alan Lomax pointed out that the Old Ways approach is so novel that
 
even with good diplomatic work, a peer network of scholars is needed.
 
Tom Vennum added that even i
f we do contact the ethnology department
 
of a foreign government, they could insist on sending inappropriate groups.
 
Foreign governments and scholars must understand why the  Festival
 
can`t present things in "living exhibitions" that don't fit our guidelines
 
any more than can any other parts of the Smithsonian complex.
 
Prior to fieldwork, the
. Old Ways program must lay the groundwork for
 
that fieldwork through cables and through a visit by Ralph Rinzler, or
 
someone else at a high level, to go with U
.S. Embassy personnel to meet
 
with appropriate officials at the Ministry of Culture and tell them who the
 
American fieldworker will be and the s
cholar in that nation with whom
 
we want to work.  Later, if there are changes made in the list of partici-
pants decided upon, we can go back to friends at a high political level
 
for redress.
 
Feedback 
A
. Through Touring
 
Touring the foreign groups is one way of providing feedback t
o  com
-
munities throughout the U
.S.  For maximum effectiveness on tour, there should
 
be attempts to work with folklorists in each city who could use
. foreign

folk.artists effectively in many ways.
 
Interest in groups from abroad and feeling of ethnic identity are
 
highest in small towns or in neighborhoods  
in large cities.
 
Fieldworkers should be aware of the t
our component of the Old Ways
 
program and should plan for it.  Fieldwork in the U
.S. also could lay the
 
groundwork for some tour bookings.
 
Tour plans demand a very high level of planning in cultural terms,
 
and funds should be available for adequate staff.
 
B
. Through Filming and Recording
 
Advantages of filming: through educational television '
it would increase
 
feedback to individual communities, especially in the U.S.  Feedback to
 
foreign nations would help in informing them of what the Old Ways program
 
is seeking, why particular things from the countries have been chosen to
 
be brought to the Festival.  In addition, the film and recordings could
 
be a comprehensive documentary of twelve weeks of national and international
 
participation.
 
The film would reflect the multi-ethnic character of the U.S. political
 
and cultural system, would counteract current impressions and would answer
 
foreign nations inquiries about what contributions the U.S. has made which
 
are worthy of their participation i
n our Bicentennial.
 
Alan Lomax suggested that Bob Young and John Marshall do the filming.
 
There was consensus that such a film could be a very important cultural
 
document and that the project should be undertaken.
 
The filming project should be a coordinated effort of NET,and NFA;_with
 
the initiative coming from the American Revolution Bicentennial Administra-
tion.  It was suggested that Jim Morris arrange for the funding.  The project
 
could not fit into the present Festival budget but must have its own.
 
In regard to the recording project, Ralph pointed out that even though
 
the film would be distributed widely, many more people could buy records and
 
take them home.than would ever see the film.  Therefore, a recording project
 
is very important.  The Advisory Cotu::-
iittee recommended the taping of all
 
music in 1975 and 1976, using a high  quality stereo recording set-up, a
 
good engineer and an ethnomusicologist  who will work with the performers.
 
The recording should be done in a good acoustical situation at Marymount
 
with an audience of other participants.
 
Advisory Committee Observation of 1975 Festival of American Folklife
  
Ralph suggested that the visit encompass five days:  Saturday and Sunday,
 
heavy days of the first week;  Monday and Tuesday to observe preparation and
 
rehearsals; Wednesday, as example of first day of second week.
 
Discussion of advantages of simultaneous or separate visits;  decision
 
for simultaneous visits.
 
I
 
-5-
A taped discussion evaluating what is observed will serve as a
 
report.  No decision on who should chair the discussion.  It should take
 
place during the five-day period.
 
Recommendations
  
The Old [
days in the New World Advisory Committee recommends very
 
strongly to the Division of Performing Arts Administration
 
1
)  that fieldwork and developmental activity need to have the
 
highest priority and that there be adequate funding for the
 
research programming aspect of the Festival
 
2
)  that a new approach, with a richer and more scholarly staff being
 
brought in, should have as part of its assignment the job of
 
looking into making the Festival into something that will have
 
permanent value in terms of scholarship and research in the years
 
after 1976.  This should be related to folklore scholarship abroad
 
and the interchange of these folklore scholars between the U.S.
 
and their home nations.
 
3
)  that this new approach include not only s
cholarship but the
 
encouragement of performance and continuity at the grassroots
 
level
 
A
 
4
)  that the basic benefit of the Festival will be how well it handles
 
the cultural feedback problem:  how participants are looked after,
 
how the communities they come from are considered and how the media
 
are used.  The Festival should not use participants and their
 
communities simply a
's live exhibi ts or the whole purpose:
,df:our
 
work and concern will be abrogated.
 
5
)  that the most important outcome of the Festival is what the field-
worker and Advisory Committee do in relation to each of the foreign
 
and domestic groups so that when they return home they have been
 
strengthened rather than weakened.  There should be a later follow-
up of the groups and exploration of research ideas which have come
 
from the f
 ieldworkers.
 
6
)  that fieldworkers be encouraged to include with the group from
 
overseas a foreign scholar to work with us on presentation.
 
7
)  that the possibility be explored of arranging for the foreign
 
scholar to remain after the Festival to pursue his own research.
 
This could give him the opportunity to a
) see what happens here
 
in terms of cultural interchange between immigrant groups who have
 
been in the U
.S. a long time and the foreign participants, and
 
b
) to do some collecting from both groups.
 
It is important that there be a response to the often-asked question
 
about how the Festival plans to avoid provoking a cultural ripoff.
 
Therefore, it was further recoiiuiiended that a condensed part of the discussions
 
be circulated, and that a letter incorporating the proceedings be sent to

John Warner of the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration, to
 
the White House and to Secretary Ripley.
 
DISCUSSIONS ON SPECIFIC NATIONS
 
Germany
  
Traditions:
 springtime festivals and Fasching.  We could bring a
 
piece of a German festival.  South German iron-workers' guild does an
 
elaborate sword dance with terrific music;
 it has movements like a clock
 
face.  Alan Lomax said he could supply further information on this.
 
Selection of fieldworker postponed as well as decision on need for
 
further domestic and overseas fieldwork.
 
Italy
  
Fieldworker:  Anna Lomax
 
United Kingdom
  
Szwed and Goffman of the University of Pennsylvania have been working
 
in South Philadelphia on dancing.  John Szwed should be involved in fieldwork
 
plans.  Ralph said he'd ask him if he could find time.
 
Ireland
  
Fieldworker:  Mick Maloney;  should begin fieldwork in the U.S.
 
Alan Lomax suggested the man who took Margaret Barry around when she
 
was here.  Who was he?
 
*
 We should check on what Larry McCullough and Mick Maloney are getting
 
an NEA grant for.  Explore with Jabbour.  No fieldwork needed in Ireland;
 
knowledgeable people here could determine participants.  Alan Lomax urged
 
that Robin Howard also be considered.
 
Great Britain
  
Fieldworker:  none suggested for U.S. work.  No fieldworker needed in
 
Great Britain.
 
Mexico 
Fieldworker:  Arturo Warman might be free t
o work on it for some months
 
in Mexico and the U.S., or Irene Vasquez suggested.  DickBauman may have sug-
gestions, or Alan Lomax suggested that one of the knowledgeable American
 
anthropologists in Mexico could give suggestions.  Crafts are most important;
 
music is secondary in Mexico.
 
France
  
Fieldworker:  Claudie Marcel-Dubois or John Wright and Catherine Peurier
 
• 
-7-
for work in France.
 
U.S. work has been done in Louisiana.  Should do French Canadian stuff
 
in New England (Riendeau Family, foot rapping) and Northern
. Mighigan,  This
 
U.S. fieldwork should be correlated with Regional America,
 
Scandinavia 
Gordon Tracie currently in Scandinavia,
 
Japan 
Fieldworker:  Miiko Toelken has indicated she may not be able to
 
continue for 1976.  Gen'ichi Tsuge is a graduate student at Wesleyan
 
*
 University and a former student of Professor Koizumi.  Old Ways staff
 
should contact him s
oon before he leaves for Japan.
 
Yugoslavia 
Fieldwork possibilities for U.S.:  Nahoma Sachs, Carole Silverman,
 
and Zarko Ledac, Yugoslav anthropology student at Wesleyan,  Areas
 
Gulf Coast, Pittsburgh area, California.
 
Fieldwork in Yugoslavia:  many suggestions given previously by Alan
 
Lomax.
 
Spain 
Fieldwork in U.S.:  Richard Stark, Etienne Phipps;  Michael Kenney
 
*
 was suggested by Dr. Arensberg.  Areas -- Asturians in N.Y.;  Galician
 
piper;  a Hall at 8th Ave. and 40th St. in N.Y.
 Alan Lomax is willing
 
to contact Baroja in Spain in person or by letter.
 
Israel
  
Fieldwork in U
.S. and Israel:  Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett
 
Austria
  
Fieldwork in U.S.:  John Cole and Eric Wolf (
sp?) have done a book,
 
Discussion about possibility of sending Division of Performing Arts emis-
sary to talk with Dr. Pfoundler.
 
*
 Alan Lomax said he would write a note to Anna Gerlachstein.
 
Hungary
  
Fieldwork in U.S.:  Stephen Erdely
 
Fieldwork in Hungary:  Thomas Hofer
 
Poland
  
Fieldwork in U.S. and abroad:  James Kimball

J
 
Belgium 
Traditions:  puppetry;
 there are masked guild dances in all Belgian
 
towns.  Dr. Arensberg reported that the masked guild dancers sometimes
 
travel from town to town.
 
*
 Alan Lomax suggested that Ralph write to Kerezztessy about his
 
evaluation of Francoise Lempereur.
 
Netherlands
  
Traditions:
 singing in unison.  Alan Lomax suggested the Volendam
 
wooden shoe dance.
 Suggestion that Tom Vennum call William Malm about
 
Dutch communities in Michigan and suggestions for a fieldworker.  Alan
 
* Lomax said he would write a letter to Vander Mollen (with a copy to Old
 
Ways) about Dutch folklore.
 
Greece
  
Fieldworker:  Sotirios Chianos, ethnomusicologist at Binghamton.
 
May need persuasion.  Dr. McAllester should be asked to call him.  Could
 
start work at once.
 
Czechoslovakia
  
Fieldworker in U.S. and abroad:  Svatava Jakobson
 
Bulgaria
  
Decision not to contact Richard Crum.  Perhaps Svatava could do field-
work in Bulgaria on Czechoslovak trip.  She will also look at Bulgarian
 
communities in the U.S.
 
Portugal
 
*
 Joanne Purcell should not do Portugues fieldwork,  Dr. Arensberg will
 
ask Charles Wagley in Florida where Jorge Diaz is.
 
Joyce Riegelhaupt was suggested.
 
There is a possibility that some of the  Azorean bands coming to New
 
Bedford-Fall River, Mass. could stay on for the Festival.  Most U.S. Portuguese
 
are from Azores, Cape Verde or Madeira.
 
Switzerland
  
Alan Lomax will write to Ted Carpenter in Basel and ask him to look
 
at the Appenzeller group and to talk to the people in the Ministry.  Tom
 
will listen to Swiss 45's and sued them on to Alan Lomax.
 
Turkey
  
Dr. McAllester suggested Dreter Chistensen, of Columbia.  He speaks
 
Turkish.  U.S. Embassy in Ankara and the State Department have urged us
 
to send American fieldworker rather than using Turkish scholar alone.

Romania
 
Fieldwork:  Dr. Mihai Pop should be called immediately before he leaves
 
the U

5/7)  He will be coming through Washington enroute home at end of May.
 
Plans made to go to Embassy.
 
Ind is
  
Fieldwork in process:  Dr. Nazir Jairazbhoy.  Also will do U
.S. fieldwork.
 
Korea
 
Fieldworker:  Song Bang-Song, getting Ph.D. at Wesleyan on 5/23.
 
*  Has family connections all over Korea.  Lives in Toronto.  Dr. McAllester
 
will call him to see if he's interested.  Good scholar.  Thesis on urbanized
 
folk instrument.  Terrific folk dancing in farm villages.  But class-consious-
ness may hinder this.
 
Pakistan
 
Fieldworker:  Dr. Nazir Jairazbhoy.  Dr. Arensberg suggested as informant

in N.Y. (

. of Penn. in the fall.
 
Canada
  
Should consider French and British tradition
nn.  Perhaps Icelanders in
 
Western Canada.  We have spoken to Carmen Roy.  The Canadian Board of
 
Tourism has organized information about e
thnic groups there,
 
Australia
 
Alan Lomax has information on sheepherding songs.  Should also consider
 
Suagis (
sp? Suagis?) who sing the Bilabong songs.
 
Lebanon
 
Bess said she was opposed to doing Lebanon twice.  Ralph said he had
 
discussed fieldwork in Lebanon with Jihad Racy.  Importance of conserving
 
Lebanese folk traditions against inroads by Baalbek.  Could strengthen
 
Jihad Racy's hand by encouraging conservation through selection fo Lebanese
 
groups for the Festival.
 
Question:  Can funds be put in the American Folklore Society to pay small
 
stipends to European researchers doing little projects for us?
 
Alan Lester will check.

INTERVIEW WITH BILL PEARSON -- T
CM, BFSS, SUSAN, FRANK present

do
 
Bill:  how/we choose perfoiners for a festival such as we have -- are we reviving-
dying customs or encouraging living customs and promulgating new aspects of them?
 
The Festival never made it exactly clear what the musical purpose of the festival was.
 
This came up in a context of why we were discouraging electronic music at the
 
Festival.  Bill thinks that from a strictly musicological point of view rock and
 
electronic music is m by now a part of everyone's heritage. & e feels that it's okay
 
for us to support an acoustical pre-industrial musical style�we should say that clearly.
 
If on the other a hand we are intending to represent American xxsio musical tradition
 
today
 across the board, we should have had more electrified music than we had.
 
If we choose not to represent a tradition, that's okay, but we shouldn't allow people
 
to think that it's non-traditional (
s  ce we don't have it).
 
Occasionally people would ask from the =x  crowd why are you not including electrified
 
music; why don't you have western swing?
 
The interaction of professional groups and strict traditional artists was discussed.
 
Frank commented part of the problem was in schdduling the Boys of the Lough who never
 
got to sing more than two songs at a time and were frustrated and angry; the De Dannon
 
group had half an hour programs during Irish wcck and^felt good wo so they integrated
 
better with the older traditionalists.  In general the feeling was that professional
 
groups and traditionalists can be presented at the same time if they are handled
 
properly.  Px :

The Diaspora part of the festival both in terms of field work and presentation
 
though it should have been the best Hp part of the festival was, Bill thinks, the
 
weakest.  Their field work in the west indes was pitiful, and their presentations
 
on the festival stage were more directed towards the slick pop show style rather
 
than trying to convey some data which might have been useful to the audience in
 
f
inding out what the music was about.  A person who should have been allowed to presetn
 
more often was the Belgian guy with Zaire; f
ialim was a victim of that pop format, -1
-10,
 
The goal of their presenters was to be H showmen.  James Early often made Jesse
 
Jackson style impassioned speeches which was okay but they didn't explain a anything
 
about the music to the people.  Bill Wiggins tried to say something substantive about
 
the music but he didn't know anything much really.  They did find sane very finde
 
perfozners but they also had some
 poor ones like the Zydeco band and two of their
 
blues bands . Also presenting avant garde experimental electronic music as they did
 
at the last confuses the issue very much; it was jazz rather than any relationship to
 
folk.
 
We really shied away from m saying things that might be cultural judgments, since they
 
are so easy to misunderstand.  Bill thinks �
 anyone doing anything like his
 
job in future should be brought on several months ahead of time in order to build up
 
his own knowledge and information in order to make coherent statements.  Bess suggested
 
a cantometric run-through for a cultural style picture for each area from which
 
generalized comments could be made.  fixEill Where Bill had had direct experience
 
and time to research he was on pretty sure territory but where he hadn't he had to
 
depend on field workers notes which were sometimes not very informative.  Susan sug-
gested that in future we should require of field workers that they prepare an over-
view statement making cultural statements and sketching in the historical and
 
cultural background
 -
 their field reports.
 
Frank:  there was never any clearly enunciated purpose for the main stage; opinions
 
ranged from Ralph's view that it relieved crowding to B
.C.'s notion that it was
 
where we should and could put our porofessional foot forward.  Physically it was
 
hostile to most of what the rest of the festival was about; it was a performance
 
context that was removed from anything we were trying to present -- traditional
 
people didn;t work that well in that context.  The Rumanian group was designed for
 
main stage presentation but everywhere else, where we were trying to present people
 
in something like perfozma mex¢makexk natural performance context, people were
 
frightened of performing there.  It was too high; it was too formal.  It was perfect
 
for blues bands and professional bluegrass but not for most of the folks.
 
Fifty-five thousand dollars was budgeted for sound there and 1
0,000 for construction
 
but nothing for presentation or programming until the last minute when we shifted
 
things around in order to get Bill and Al on.  This is pretty characteristic, Frank
 
thinks, of the confused attitude towards what the main stage was for anyway.
 
The rationale for the main stage was unclear and also poorly communicated to the
 
program areas.  In Old Ways, Shirley was working against Susan in trying to get coopera-
tion for the main stage, so the field workers were picking up one message f
rom Shirley
 
and another from Susan.  There were a lot of the field workers who understood the
 
cross-cultural idea immddiately but a lot that never did.  Tom suggested that perhaps
 
the ethnomusicologists who tended to think cross-culturally caught on better, being
 
a bit broader in their perspectives than even the folklorists who often tended to
 
be extremely protective of their fiefdoms "
tl��:  
,
, F
G  S",
 
Bill:  it seems to him an error to continue a festival based solely in Washington
 
and continue calling it a FAF.  It should be moved around the country from year to year
 
if we are coninuing to put on a national festival, one year in one state, one year
 
in another and so on.
 
We needed more people to go around and check on the well-being of perfauters; E
.C.
 
and Orna Ball were put on for too long periods and were too tired and didn't want to
 
c
omplain.  Probably there are many such situations we'll never know about.  There
 
should have been more checks and more fall-backs to m
inimize the damage of the
 
ims mnakimex occasional insensitive people we hired.
 
The Festival stage programs were often not as strong as they could have been because
 
there was not enough time to work�
�1th the perfo-
Li
ters before going on stage; we really
 
needed two presenters.  Repertoird^could have been selected.  Additional presenters
 
attached to the main stage should have been out on the festival grounds listening to
 
what the next days performers could have been.  Two is simply the minimum.
 
It would have been better if Bill could have gone to the site and listened to the
 
programs as given the first day; the rehearsals were useful, but the programs would
 
have been better.  Rehearsals were useful if they show very briefly what each per-
formance would be about; the least successful rehearsals were the ones that were
 
d
ominated by the fi]sning.
 
The musicians registry was marginally helpful from Old Ways when Bill got to see it;
 
Bill McNeill was a big help from Regional; Diaspora people were pmjdKy hostile to the
 
notion that a musicians registry was even being considered and were offended that
 
Bill w" enquired; Native couldn't give Bill anything because they didn't know what
 
was coming.  If the concept had been well done, it would have been a tremendous help.
 
The scheduling procedure that was finally evolved was probably the best that could be
 
worked out; they did it with Diaspora and Regional the Saturday or Sunday of the week
 
before and` W Old Ways at the rehearsal.  Bill says that anybody who was a field worker
 
who didn't feel himself responsible to prepare axfH x1y in real detail what his
 
performers were about, where they were from, what they did etc. shou
l dn't have been
 
hired.
 
The sound system on main stage was totally absurd; there was no f
lexibility
 
of miking.  People who moved around could not be miked at all; there should have
 
been overhead miking.  The stage was miserably designed for dancing; the crowd
 
couldn't see the people if they moved to the back of the stage at all and the
 
roof was so low that dancers couldn't jump up the way they wanted to.  In order
 
to allow the dancers to dance at all, the monitors had to be moved off so that
 
the audience could haaxzich m see them and then the musicians couldn't hear themselves
 
back.  The structure was so high that people couldn't see well anyway and it was
 
far too formal.  Also the stage was K so small that a lot of things, such as
 
Diaspora programs, couldn't be presented effectively.
 
(
from notes taken 10-26-76: Bill, Tom., Susan ,
 Bess)
 
It's clear from Bill's comments about his lack of knowledge of main stage
 
rationale, that we slipped up in passing information on to himand probably
 
to other people who came in  to work on the Festival in the spring of 76 and
 
at the beginning of the summer.  We need to think about the way peopd
)e are
 
phased into a festival and make sure we fill them in.  We may have been
 
making assumptions about things they knew or understood about our theoretical frame-
work� t

Bess pointed out the the presentation of folk-root material followed by the
 
evolved, more s
dnR3A urban or what have you material usually leaves
 
the impression that the latter is the good stuff.  She says this model was
 
used by Ralph in P
-arlier festivals and she objected to it
 '
a wn; �
.
a�
 
Susan pointed out that the linear thinking of Western culture programs us
 
to see t
lwx a linear model as moving toward perfection- i
.e. the evolution
 
model.
 
It is clear from Bill's comments and our responses that the main stage f
unction
 
needs to be rethought.  What is its function?  How can we get it to do what we
 
say it should do?
 
One thing that worked was greater flexibility in scheduling main stage -- this
 
started about week 6
 when Regional and Old Ways had particularly weak per-
formance components andthe Main Stage began to open later in the day.
 
The last four weeks of persons and groups hired just for main stage eased
 
Frank and Bill's burden of programming but it presented problems.  Altrough
 
the presenter got to know the performers well because of their being their
 
and performing there often, and was thus able to make better, wore coherent
 
introductions, these participants were not functioning within a cultural
 
cont ext.  And this went against what Bill understood the ma
de to be',
 
trying to do.  It did provide, however, a place for people who could not
 j
 
really fit into any of the programs, i
.e. Me re Trav
 -
I
 S
.
 
Bill would recccnnend,\living at the dorms with the participants provided
 
people were careful to plan escape for times out.  Thus it would be easier
 
to get to know performers for presentational reasons and just all around
 
everyone feeling better about eadh other.
 
Bill had mixed feelings about the musicians who worked in Working America.
 
He felt that many of them were good perfoLiiers and good musicians but he also
 
felt that they did not fit into the context of the Festival and were not
 
operating in the folk 6orm.
 
t- O "
 
M@
! question raised here and elsewhere is, what do we do with the folknik
 
contingency that we have more or less inherited fin our awn past-- and
 
maybe form other festivals too?
 
We also talked here about the possibility of exploring and exploiting the
 
multiple ro&es of our participants- their occupations, region, ethnic heritage,
 
skill or talent.  The main stage might functicn in this way rather than or in
 
addition to presenting the cross cultural picttre.  This might help put to-
gether the shattered image of folklife we present.
 
If we do pursue the cross cultural idea, Susan suggests that we need to plan
 
the Festival with that in mind.  Just another thing to keep in our heads while
 
planning schedules.
 
Bill pointed out that for main stage the French week, esp. the Cajuns, worked
 
best for making the cross cultural point.  The Cajuns plus the U
.S .
 French
 
Canadians., and the Cajuns from Regional, Old Ways  and African Diaspora.
 
Again the question comes up, why did this week work so well?  Even better than
 
the Hispanic week where we really concentrated our energies to produce a cross-
cultural statement? Bess told how the Cajuns adojed the Regional stage with a
 
dance floor as their meeting ground and came from all over the Festival to
 
gather there.  It was, in her words, the way Regional ought to have operated..
 
In general, the two sessio n,
 pointed up our need to rethink the main stage
 
rationale and work out its effectiveness.
 
One suggestion was that perhaps we do evening concerts and even cross-cultural
 
things on area stages.  We could thus eliminate main stage (
Bill suggested that
 
in a way, it violates what all the other areas are about).  Or we could have a
 
main stage area, less elaborate, maybe with a dance floor,"for big bashes and
 
programs when crowds were heavy, etc.
 .

To explicate further, why could not Working Americans demonstrate their additional
 
traditional skills (
a fiddle playoxing railroad engineer, a fa ner-sculptor)?  There
 
really is no place in the entire festival where multiple roles are explored --
occupational, regional, ethnic, religious.

General statements extractedn from Susie Cox interview:
 
1
)
 In future festivals, more folklorists should live in the dorms.
 
2
)
 Crafts presentations are better when more than the object itself
 
and how it is made are discussed.
 There should be some relationship
 
established between the activity and the life style and cultural
 
background of the participant.
 
3
)
 The Old Ways program should probably have paid more attention to
 
crafts; audiences seemed to want that.
 
4
)
 Food demonstrations should be reprogrammed or redesigned rather
 
than dropped.
 
L
 
5
)
 Where revival performers are used, they should not be allowed to
 
be in competition in any way with traditional performers.
 This can
 
be controlled by careful programming and by selecting revivalists with
 
genuine appreciation of and affection for tradition.
 
6
)
 Presenters should provide commentary on the cultural background
 
and give some historical perspective, not simply introduce the individual
 
performers and talk about their specific repertoire.
 Many presenters
 
spoke well about the performances themselves and knew the particular
 
participants and their personal history, but failed to give the audience
 
any overall perspective of the cultural importance of the material.
 
7
)
 More attention should be paid to helping presenters with simple
 
staging suggestions.
 
8
)
 We did not pay enough attention to ceremony.
 A specific suggestion
 
was to have a final ceremonial on each Old Ways stage  (as we did for the
 
Italians), thanking the performers and wishing them well;  this should be
 
done by Festival VIPs.
 
9
)
 It is clear that visitation by Festival directors must be regular
 
and highly visible to the performers and the presenters.
 One visit is
 
not enough;  sensitivities are highly acute, especially when important
 
or senior folklorists are concerned.
 
10)
 Programs really needed the 50 participants to bring off a coherent
 
presentation for the 6 hour stretch.
 All smaller programs suffered.
 
11)
 Every effort should be made to develop a strong working relationship
 
between the presenters  (domestic and foreign).
 Where nightly meetings were
 
held at Georgetown,  the presentation benefitted;  (
cf. point # 1 -- if
 
more folklorists had been on hand in Georgetown, such rapport could have
 
been more quickly developed).

Why was Irish week such a  success?
 Especially since it started out with
 
such had vibes.
 Suzie suggests t
he reason was the level of the per-
formers which were mainly really folk; excpet for LDe Danaan and they
 
wrre presenting; traditional material  and t
tarr also respected t
he tradition
 
hearers.  The other reason was in,o the presenters- Tom was tense  
—cut
 
saran was very gentle and laid back an d so was ?
tick.  Their planning
 
sessions were masterpeices of cooperation and consideration for each
 
othdr.
 (De LDannan by the way,  seemed to avoid t

 In the Irish American community there is

having no knowledge of
 
what the French program would actually be, she had set the French up in
 
separate blocks.)  off-stage there was good interaction and songswapping
 
between t

French performer selection was excellent;  the problems stemmed from John's

Omrr Marcoux,  t

he crafts presentations were hest when more t
han t

iscussc-d.
 (The Irish ladies talked about t
heir
, lives as did
 
Omer Marcnu�).
 This may turn out to be the distinction between presenting
 
CT a ftS  and presenti
.ns; occupations.
 Crafts expertise was almost secondary
 
to whether or not t
he person had a personal involvement with t
he activity
 
(If it's an occupation, you step into an outside role and leave your
 
own identity behind.)
 
OW maybe should have had more crafts•
,WbT people,creally seemed interested in

 If �,ou  don't have any crafts coming from overseas, you don't develop
 
much interest in your domestic f

SCANDINAVIAN - TOM AND SUSAN
 ( P
, 655)
 
Gordon did all his field work with Shirley over the phone; he turned in
 
very few usable or accurate tapes and very little in the line of reports.
 
The entire programmatic content was decided between Shirley and Gordon;
 _
 
he was quite arrogant with Tom and Bess and took suggestions from us badly.
 
As a result, there was little variety in overall programmatic content during
 
Scandinavian week though what was there was good quality on the whole.
 
He is very quick to settle on reviNlistic material and makes not much effort to
 
dig for older root stuff.
 Example:
 the horn player (birchbark oboe and pastoral
 
horn) Swedish xx or Norwegian; Tom really questions whether this is a "real"
 
instrument; it was modelled on an archaeological find from the 13th centyry but
 
had a nice modern diatonic scale; Tom felt the whole thing was spurious.
 It really
 
was a revival instrument and presented as such.
 
Gordon is totally stubborn; Bill Pearson said he was impossible to deal with on
 
the main stage, changing his schedule every day and cancelling performers without
 
notificationx and in a really high-handed manner.
 He handled our objections to
 
his field work by not sending in reports, tapes or information until it was
 
simply too late to make any alteration a or suggestion.
 Overall all the program
 
staff objected to Gordon's high-handedness and general arrogance.
 
Tom objected also to the fact that Gordon brought the boat builder to make only
 
a model here and then piggy-back off the Smithsonian to do a real boat in
 
Seattle.
 The same guy was the Faroe singers'  lead, but still Gordon wanted
 
the boat building more than the dancing (until he saw it finally).
 
Susan says Gordon over=scheduled his people, especially the Americans; they
 
complained and were unhappy about it.
 Sonja Savig is a professional ethnic;
 
Bess/Tom/Susan recommended against her (she accompanies herself on guitar) but
 
Gordon wanted her and we decided the program needed some variety -- however,
 
in spite of our requests that she sing a cappella she went ahead and did her
 
typical program the way she wanted.
 
The issue with Gordon is that he is extremely rigid and gnzxion opinionated; he
 
took almost no suggestions from Bess and went to the Faroes under protest.
 We
 
are none of us sure whether or not the statements Shirley makes in the interaview
 
(which she gets from Gordon) are really true.
 For example, "there is no dance
 
tradition in Finland".
 Bess saw general public folkdance when visiting Helsinki
 
on Midsummer Eve; perhaps this is a spurious tradition but it clearly was there
 
and nobody was teaching the steps.
 Generally, Bess feels that Gordon is too
 
cocksure and has not really s done the kind
 of  di gg in g we  require of other field
 
workers, either in the US or abroad.
 He seems content with a kind of surfacy
 
approach, banking on his contacts with well known fiddlers etc.
 2tzii His doing
 
his field work through the various folk music houses in Scandinavia seems as
 
tkexgkzaaxzB,Jxixixhxfaikiazi$t parallel to our doing British field work in
 .
,
..._
 
the British Country Dance Society.
 1K Tom says there are Finnish bands in northern�r�.
 
Wisconsin, yet we had no Finnish American musicians; he too questions hazAexLKz
 
the extent of Gordon's field work. Basicall
y Susan
 says in the US part of the
 
program ka Gordon brought back what he had had here before and he brought people
 
from his x own geographic area.
 Olga Nilsson, however, was dynamite -- an ex-
cellent choice, and there were obviously some others.
 Suzanne Broback, who sang a
 
only in the activities center, was lovely; she sang songs she sings to babies and
 
people listened to her with tears in their eyes.
 (We fought to get her as a
 
c
ounterblanace t
o the revival groups.
 
Shirley really badmouthed field workers who did not turn in their reports
 
on time except for Gordon.
 
Scandinavians were very successful with their dancing, both on the sragax dance
 
floor and on their various stages.  Auden taught well and got people to partici-
pate; he started out with the funny sort of hmstility that
L seemed to prevail
 
towards the Faroese but changed around as the week went along.  Auden functionned
 
really quite well as a presenter.
 
W
w
 
Craft demos really should be able to  be l
ooked at  I
n the round; Mrs.
 
Takahashi you couldn't appreciate unless you looked over: her shoulder,
 
for example, so that you saw the sand painting being made from her
 
perspective.
 This was why some things in terms of craft demonstrations
 
and discussions worked better in the Old Ways learning center than in
 
the craft tents.
 
POLAND
 
Ralph beautifully manipulated the problems with the ministry of foreign
 
culture and got through to Bielawsky who was terrific xxg who also had
 
a good working relationship with Jim Kimball, our domestic field worker.
 
Jim said that Bielawsky was a very good choice because he is not specially
 
important in Polish governmental terms, and therefore people did don't
 
notice especially what he dog did or pay much attention to his program
s
 
Jim was an excellent field worker and presenter; did a nice job with the
 
domestic.
 The paper cutter he found was unbearable alone but perfgect for
 
the festival; Jim apparently recognized this in advance.
 The Gramada
 
family were a little weak musically but made up for it by their spirit and
 
involvement.
 The week had a tremendously strengthening impact on them;
 
the Polish Poles really liked them and respected what they were doing
 
and there was none of this giggling about how they weren't as good that
 
you found in some of the foriegn troupes.
 
The Gramadas performed on stage with the Polish Poles from time to time
 
and in the activities center explained the Polish Poles well to Americans.
 
They were a big help in the acitvvities center, gzggg translating and
 
commenting, since Jim was completely tied up at the stage.
 (Bielawsky
 
did not do any presenting so that Jim was really overworked.) They also did
 
crafts  (
beadwork, metal work and embroidery on felt, demonstrating both
 
EdzRoxomax  in the craft tents and in a craft workshop on the main sragg
 
area stage.
 This was on Monday when the Polish Poles had their day off,
 
and it worked out really well -- a large audience sat and listened to
 
an entire program on crafts.
 This was in part because the Gramada daughter
 
Jane Kedron did the presenting, and she was excellent.
 They also did
 
immigrant narratives and ethnic stories plus family history.
 (
Jim had
 
outlined this and said they could do all this stuff; they worked ceaselessly
 
and were really strong participants.
 Other people wxxg dduring the summer
 
were supposed to be as versatile, but it rarely happened; the Gramadas were
 
really one of the major finds for the entire summer.)
 
Mrs.  Batori was the paper cutter.
 She was an old festival hand and kas her
 
experience was useful rather than Ike
. otherwise.
 She did a lot of teaching in
 
her presentation and also operated as a translator in the activities center.
 
The polka band (American) was a super big hit; they were very nervous to
 
begin with because they felt they didn't have anything to offer and weren't
 
really secure in their identities as Polish Americans (
they don't bill them-
selves that way) so their popularity was a real boost for their morale.
 They
 
got very close with the people from Poland; they sang together a lot in the
 
dorms and played for dancing by the young women from Poland who loved to
 
dance to their music.
 It was important to include them because it was such
 
an important urban tradition, and this particular group had such a large reper-
toire in Polish.

(
The Polka band couldn't speak Polish but could and s
l
id sing i
n it.)
 
Some of the material that came from Poland was beginning to get choreographed
 
and organized; you could tell - it was obvious a
s they repeated each day
 
the same way.  They did have fine voices and the loudness
 of  Polish
 sin
gin g
 
in general especially the Slovak border f
olks is astounding.
 
Jim presented very well -- finally began to include some translations of
 
lyrics and chose nicely.
 Good content generally.  The small Polish
 
singer Aiertek, was especially fine -- generally the foreign component
 
from Poland contained about ten women, and that made f
or interesting programming  _
...�  
possibilities.
 Overall an extremely strong pnxg program.
 x,
,,
WA , 
The serious problem that week was attending to the needs of the participants;
 
fortunately the Americans didn't need much but the Poles did and they didn't
 
get i
t.  The cultural liason Alicia was very good and helped out a lot.
 
However, their a
ssistant program coordinator didn't spend any time with
 
them; they really needed warm beverages and Larisa didn't provide them.
 
She dropped out; she liked people like the Yugoslays who had style.  The
 
Poles were too poor and ordinary f
or her so she didn't do anything for them.
 
Jim has a bit of a whiny style; he didn't seem to know how to operate in
 
our xk3L system to get what he wanted and he didn't get any help from Larissa
 
so he went to Susanx all the time, and basically, the Poles did not get the
 
same kind of t
.l.c. that Jeffery and Susie provided their participants.
 
We really needed a map that week.
 Shirley consistently refused to pay for
 
maps, so they were not available almost any week.  We really should have
 
insisted a
t the beginning that maps be provided f
or each country in Old Ways
 
and forced them to be budgeted for.
 Some embassies had suitable maps for
 
loan but others did not.
 
If we are going to do kkxk the kind of festival we say we're doing and get
 
in the kind of people we say we're getting, we must take care of them properly
 
and we must realize that they are poor and cannot afford to pay for their
 
own beer and wine, etc.
 Susan saw the Polish Poles wardrobes and they had
 
very little.
 They needed 1
2tait laundry taken care of and similar things.
 Susan
 
says that nowhere in the whole f
estival did she feel this a
s strongly as with
 
the Poles, except f
or the case of Cleophus, where we similarly didn't really
 
do our t
.l.c. responsibilities.

YUGOSLAVIA
 
x Turned out to be quite good; we were worried about getting a troupe but
 
got several bunches of real folks.
 Dr. Dxagkxiaex Dragoslav Antonijevic
 
from the Institute for Balkan Studies na picked out some terrific stuff.'
 
The Macedonian dancers were excellent, danced to the zurna and drum, very
 
athletic and exciting.
 Two ladies sang with a man -- all from Herzegouina
 
also excellent.
 Altogether an exciting,and interesting and well composed
 
troupe.
 
Domestic field work done by Richard Marks.
 He had some trouble reaching the
 
level he wanted originally because many of the people he really wanted refused
 
to come.
 He had to tap into a slightly more politicized consciousness-
raised group in the community in order
s to get people who would come.
 He really
 
did get some very good stuff eventually; almost all of them spoke one or another
 
Yugoslavian language and they in8eracted well with the Yugoslavians.
 
Twox9exbian  The Slovak mens quartet was a little slow; the Lubitzan all-girl
 
tamburitzan (with one boy) was a smash success.
 Lots of audience participation
 
that week; a lot of people came and stayed all week specifically to do the
 
Yugoslavian dances.
 The Yugoslavian guslar was a little slow also; he would
 
have gone over better in the activities center where people could look at his
 
instrument more closely and his tradition could be explained in more detail but
 
he just wouldn't come -- he was a star.
 
Svatava and Richard did the presenting; Richard knew everything about them and
 
was an okay presenter but he zxzxaxiitk1a had already taken the Yugoslavians
 
on a bit of the tour -px schedule before hand and he had already worked out what
 
he wanted to say and didn't change it much.
 He wasn't a really exciting pre-
senter.
 Also he was somewhat irresponsible and immature; he would just leave
 
the performance and go away and there would be long periods when nobody knew
 
where he was.
 Svatava had to be down in Regional with the Czechs a good bit of
 
the time; kaxiS when he left (which he did most frequently with the domestics
 
who he thought could present themselves) Larissa and Susan filled in for him
 
some of the time.
 It really doesn't work for domestic people to present them-
selves.
 Overall, though, the performances were excellent.
 
There was a tamburitza maker in the crafts tent and he was fine; there was a
 
woman who made a part of the costume an agva maker who was the only person who
 
left the festival early.
 She was just plain unhappy and sour and complained
 
bitterly to everybody who came so we offered to send her home early and she went.
 
Nobody was quite sure what was the matter with her; when you fixed one thing,
 
she would switch her complaint to something else.
 
There was a nice contrast that week between the Irish and the Yugoslays.
 The Irish
 
more laid back and low key and the Yugoslays more flamboyant.
 The Yugoslav
 
food demo was very good as was the food sales -- lots of people came down to
 
get the Yugoslav food and take it back to the Irish stage.

ROMANIA
 
i
 
Overseas material basically a troupe and Ralph hated i
t; l
ie worked very
 
hard to get root material out of them and succeeded with the fiddler but
 
he (
the f
iddler) never really performed the material.  Essentially, they
 
stuck t
o their own prechoreographed performance and showed little ability
 
to be flexible.
 Sam Beck reported in his tour report, the Romanians apparently
 
felt that in our suggestions for changes we were really gpli attempting to
 
humiliate them in front of American audiences.  They wanted to be flexible
 
and cooperative but were most suspicious of our motives and never really got
 
the message.
 They sent along a government official and a "folklorist" not
 
approved apparently by Popp.
 
Svatava brought a liturgical group from Detroit who sang pretty old stuff,
 
not bad, mostly two and three part singing, somewhat quiet and not especially
 
splashy, with a choral director.
 It 4as hard on the domestic f
olks to be up
 
against that rather spiffy Romanian troupes,.
 John Lazar's group was mostly
 
instrumental and played for dancing; they did the kissing dance which went
 
over well with audiences and got a lot of approva l.  As the week went on
 
the domestic Romanians seemed to feel stronger and better about themselves,
 
though essentially shy and a little feeling of having been put down.
 
Svatava worked out a session of immigrant songs with the domestic troupe, and
 
seemed to have interested some of the Romanian Romanians in the
sis repertoire,
 
Bess thinks.
 There were, Svatava f
ound, two different types of subject matter
 
dealt with in the immigrant songs -- one repertoire expressing the feelings
 
of people who immigrated before World War I (
or maybe II?) and one repertoire
 
after.
 She got the people to talk some about their immigrant experiences from
 
the stage; they particularly were concerned with preserving their language.
 
They had some needlework and an egg painter in the crafts exhibit; they were
 
doubling and so were not there very often.  W
iRzxlamastdxparhapx  Doubling in
 
terms of crafts doesn't seem to work very well, Susan thinks.  Larissa's
 
mother was the food demo person; i
t seemed to work out okay.
 Sam Beck
 
turned out t
o be a fairly good presenter (
Tom had had to get hold of him in a
 
hurry because of the tour meetings in the spring and Svatava hadn't located
 
anybody).
 He was basically an anthropologist; he didn't really understand
 
why we were unhappy with the troupe aspects of it and kind of stuck up for them
 
but gradually Ralph felt better about him as the week went on.  He did learn
 
what there was to learn and said it, but basically he felt put on the spot by
 
our attitude since he wanted to go back to Romania to do field work and didn't
 
want to push anybody around or get to be persona non grata.
 (
Underneath it all,
 
I think he was one of those people who opposed telling the f
olks what to do
 
on theoreticaly grounds as well as practical.) Sam was a bit like Jaime, also
 
an anthropologist; basically, we need t
o pick our presenters f
rom folks who are
 
ethnomusicologists or f
olklorists.  This was a case where the field worker was
 
working a bit at cross purposes to the program and though he wasn't unpleasant
 
about it, i
t did make difficulties.

HUNGARY
 Tcm/Bess/Susan
 
Hungarians all sat on stage together along with their paintings which they used
 
to provide atmosphere and there was as a result very little roan.  Basicallky
 
they were a troupe, somewhat semi-professional and young people (
college students
 
and the like).  The instrumental group was apparently gypsy, and quite nice
 
though undoubtedly very urban;  (
no one of this group feels competent to distin-
guish cabaret instru
mental tradition from rural instrumental tradition, assuming
 
there is any).  Most of the Hungarian material was vocal, solo and chorus;
 
lots of dancing -= much emphasis on regional costume.
 
Domestic Hungarians  included the group from New Jersey (
father, daughter-in-law
 
and son who came only on the weekbnd and the two grandchildren).  Father made
 
h zithers (
strummed); duahgter-in-law played with father; daughter-in-law sang
 
with children.  Son apparently played some percussion on the stage, did not do
 
workshops.  They were very successful; Judith Magyar was extremely serious --
worked well on stage, practiced and helped in activities center in between times.
 
Louisiana Hungarians thought the New Jersey group took themselves too seriously
 
and sort of xtH resented Svatava's suggestion that Kallman Magyar might be able
 
to help then organize themselves.  He eventually did go down to Louisiana after
 
the festival; he is in the folk dance movement (
the son, this i
s -- his father
 
speaks almost no English).
 
Louisiana Hungarians felt that they were very succeasful because they got a lot of
 
feedback from the visitors -- lots of people told them that theirs were the on ly
 
true costumes and better than the Hungarian Hungarians etc.
 (
This may all be
 
fantasy, but thay went home feeling extremely satisfied about themselvesxt in
 
any event.)  There was much confusion overall because of poor communication between
 
Svatava, Tarissa and Axana, the cultural contact plus Mari, the tour lady.
 
Tarissa and Axana got along well together but were disliked by the Louisiana folks
 
who thought they treated them rudely.  Svatava was to present only the Americans;
 
Mari the Hungarian Hungarians.  Mari was not particularly effective, but this is
 
quite possibly because of the difficult relationships that maintained between the
 
various supernumeraries.  Tom and Susan had found three people before Mari was
 
hired, none of wham Larissa ever checked on and finally Mari came in sort of from
 
lef t field; she was not really qualified for such a job. This was clearly a messup
 
between Shirley and Tarissa (
Shirley backing Tarissa all the way.)
 
The l
ungarian Americans in the audience seemed really moved by the Lousiana group
 
on the grounds that unlike any other group in the country they had really hung on
 
to a part of their heritage, bits of which were still clearly recognizable, and
 
they kept coming up and congratulating the Lousiana folks for this.  Svatava may
 
have helped establish this sense that what they were doing (
however bizarre it
 
looked) was real by her lengthy introductions in which she described in total detail
 
how she found them, what they countryside looked l
ike, the houses, the small
 
communities, how she approached them fEbdmcim as a folklorist.  Though she some-
times took 20 minutes for such an intro, nobody seemed to notice audiences leaving
 
(
Bess sat through two of them and nobody went away) and the Lousiana Hungarians
 
defended Svatava when son-�
ebody remarked she talked too much and said that they
 
understood and valued what she was trying to do.  This may have been one case in
 
which lengthy introductions were actually the best strategy, particularly s
ince
 
Svatava made them very poetic and evocative.  She was good at taking a painting
 
during the Hungarian program and pointing out interesting features in it as well.
 
ty-ing it into what the Louisiana group was doing or going to do.
 
4( 
Susan says that we were really lucky to have kept the Lousiana group; they almost
 
left and there were a number of reasons for that.  When they arrived all the
 
Africans were sitting outside Harbin and they got terrified; we really should
 
be on the lanxk alert for this kind of reaction.  We find such situations so _
 
normal, but newcomers think it totally strange and potentially frightening.
 
When Susan visited them in La., they took pains to assure her that all the blacks,
 
including the Africans, at the festival were really nice folks, so apparently the
 
experience was healthy for them.  Secondly, they were very nervous about the
 
"professional" Hungarian troupe, which they felt they were being pitted against,
 
and also that the Magyars were so polished and had so obviously done this kind of
 
thing before.
 
At the rehearsal one of the things that really helped was when Ralph got them
 
all into a group and had them introduce themselves to each other in Hungarian..
 
People had made comments about the piano player and everyone was feeling very
 
uptight;  (
remember Tam "
s remark that when you get folks actually at the Festival,
 
all you can do is work with them -- there's no point in letting anybody's feelings
 
get hurt by telling them -- or acting as though -- they are bad.)  Ralph's
 
instincts to get people together in groups is really very fine; he seems to be
 
able to sense this kind of difficulty and knows haw to handle it.
 
completely
 
Something was going on in the cooking tent that week which Susan doesn't/understand
 
in toto.  Mary Reshatar (
community leader and cook) said she was doing a little
 
politicking for Jimmy Carter and collecting names from people who came.  What
 
she said was that p w qd3KK the Smithsonian had been too cheap to run off copies
 
of her recipes and so she would send them along later, but she was also collecting
 
names of people who were interested in the community, and politics and a wide range
 
of subjects. There was a lot of tension between Connie Lee, OW concessions manager,
 
and Mrs. R
.  and there
, was something happening between them so that Mary p(and
 
Susan)provided kheix own food on a couple of occasions since it hadn't been ordered.
 
Mary told Susan that she was planning to send out a newsletter to the names she
 
collected with articles on ethnic heritages and the like so she was clearly using
 
the festival as a form, and we might not be very happy with the ways she is doing
 
this.  Its probably, Susan thinks, that this kind of thing was going on all over
 
the place every week, and she thinks we should consider if we wHt want to monitor
 
this activities more closely or maybe we should help it along as another form of
 
outreach?  Maybe if we provided some channel for this kind of activity it woulnd't
 
have taken place in such a politically and emotionally charged atmosphere.
 
Overall, the hassles of Hungarian week were caused by a number of factors: it was
 
the Jaskzweukxamdxskaffxwasxtizxd next to last week and staff was tired; there were
 
political problems and fears between domestic and foreign; Hungarian culture may
 
tend toward the quarrelsome a la Israel; but most of the problem, we believe, was
 
caused by the fact that Shirley and therefore Larissa had their claws out for
 
Svatava, and because Ta rissa was undoubtedly the worst assistant RH coordinator
 
on the staff.  She was lazy and uncaring for particular the American folks through-
out the festival and the cultural liasons took her lead quite often and only inter-
acted with the foreigns groups.  She also lied.  She should under no circumstances
 
be recommended by festival staff in future.

Belgian and Belgian American presentations very different, more supplementary
 
than cognate.
 The Belgian Americans had so little music but the games
 
went very well -- they were very "in-house" activities -- i
f you hadn't
 
been in the Belgian American community, _
you never had seen them,lso that
 
audiences were interested and responsiv
e The Belgian-Americans interacted
 
very well with the Belgian participants and the audiences.
 Belgian-Americans
 
some of them have gone over to Belgium and visited their new friends.
 
The Belgian Belgians really felt at home because of the community that the
 
Belgian-Americans created for them.  l
The whole grounds (
even though the
 
group was small) felt like Belgium.,
 
t
 
Belgian music was very thin; the fife and drum with the f
lag twirler was
 
the most rousing; everything else was very quiet.
 In compensation, we
 
brought all the participants up on stage, adding psychological support;
 
this seemed to be quite effective.
 
Cultural liason, Paul, was upset with the quality of the material brought
 
from Belgium (
he himself i
s Belgian).  He felt his grandmother sang better
 
than the lady who sang; the harmonica player was off-key, etc.  Just thought
 
i
t was thin and unexciting in quality.  The flag twirler, however, i
s reknowned
 
in Belgium; has a lot of prestige.  Paul himself found the experience of
 
working with the festival a growing one.  He related more to the Flemish
 
in part because Francoise related to the Walloon -- this seems to have been
 
a personal reaction.
 Franucoise's presentation was quite scholarly, possibly
 
more (
Paul felt) than the material warranted.
 
Both presenters, Genie thought, were excellent.  Josephine worked well as
 
well as Francoise.  RRxkaxk Hubert did not exert any leadership whatever
 
though he had done kka part of the field work; he simply played on stage.
 
(
Francoise was actually in charge of the field work.)

 Two backup people who did not come to the Festival but who were extremely
 
well informed and helpful were Dorothy Heinrich - Wallon from Green Bay Wis.
 
and from Moline Illinois, kaxix Dolores Bultinck.  Her mother was one of the
 
lace makers.  Lace making was an extremely effective presentation; they had a
 
crowd around them much of the time; also interesting to see a grandmother and
 
granddaughter doing that archaic activity.
 (
Three lace makers in all.)
 
We got away with having so few people in this presentation because of the
 
nature of the Belgian American material; all the Belgian musicians being singletons,
 
J the stage ka did have t
o be closed down when the rolly bowly and archery was
 
going on.
 Overall, a good variety within this presentation; people were surprised
 
by seeing what was actually going on in midwestern communities.  The staff also
 
worked hard to make the Belgians feel_good about themselves -- parades and so
 
forth added much t
o their presentation.? S
taff also found housing -- the Washington
 
Belgian community was really super and helped in this operation (
the Belgians
 
had to stay over a week because they weren't going on tour.)
 
V
  
After the mall they stayed in Washington for a week and t
hen the Walloons
 
went to Green Bay and the Flemish went t
o Moline hosted by the Belgian
 
American communities.  This is another model that might be considered
 
for future f
estivals if foreign guests come.
 
Looking back, the people really stood out; they were very warm and very
 
individual.  The Walloon Flemish division was not uncomfortable,  (
not like
 
the Swiss, where you felt very divided) ] Since the Festival, the Flemish
 
Belgian-Americans have been visiting with the Walloon Belgian Americans
 
over Labor Day weekend, and they are keeping in touch.
 
Belgian introductory ceremony was very nice with fife and drum and
 
the flag twirler laying the flag down on the ground and inviting the
 
ambassador to come and shake hands over it -- old world and new.
 
Georman f
ood demo was the weakest of all Geneie's countries; very quiet.
 
She was a good cook but she didn't keep the conversations going -- more
 
just dishing the food out.  The Hochbrett player (
husband) was very
 
patient in demonstrating and answering questions, but he t
oo was just
 
a quiet soet of man.

Both the rolle bolle and the archery had minimal audience attractiveness.
 
They were attractive and "dressed the set" well but as for programmatic
 
interest, it was minimal.  We a had counted on them to make up for the
 
thinness of stage presentation and that actually didn't work.  The problem
 
was in part that the games were not effectively presented; where this happened
 
(
Swiss wrestling), the games added a good supplementary feeling.
 Overall
 
Tom, Susan and Bess feel that games are an excellent supplement but not
 
a substitute for strong stage programming.
 And they must be presented.
 
Pig nose amplification systems should be thrown in the pond.
 They were
 
totally inadequate for this type of outdoor presentation (games etc.)
 
also at the learning center.
 Axka Batter portable equipment must be
 
available.
 
One of the things the Belgian presentation pointed out was that you have to
 
have at least one group of some size, some community type of group to keep
 
a presentation sort of jolly and positive.
 Too many separate single and
 
double performances give an overall weak feeling.
 
Fife and drum was certainly the most rousing music; it was nice but it was
 
not all that rousing.
 
Having people on stage (
not performing) can give psychological support to
 
small performances; they can also get in the way and be distracting (as in
 
the Hungarian) program.
 The Irish worked very well because they were very
 
supportive and worked off of each other, singing similar songs for comparison
 
or adding interesting commentary.
 
Both presenters were very low key and this non-dynamic approach didn't seem
 
to help matters.
 It may have been due to the fact that the material was not
 
dynamic, but it'd difficult to tell.
 Certainly it didn't help.  Hubert Boone,
 
in contrast, came to the activities center and did the dulcimer workshop; his
 
English wasn't always under control but he was so incredibly enthusiastic
 
that it lame over much more strongly.
 He is excited about what he w is doing --
brought his book over, showed pictures and talked about the dulcimer all over
 
Europe and it was much more of a turn on than anything that happened on stage.
 
By contrast to him, the women presenters sounded knowledgeable, intelligent
 
and nice, sweet but their tone wasn't strong and positive. Hz They didn't create
 
interest; they knew the answers but then nobody asked.  A
 
Scholars are not necessarily good presenters -- field work and presentation are
 
two different things.
 The presenter must know the material but he must also
 
ha like it and be enthusiastic about it in order to attract and maintain
 
audience interest and enhthusiasm.
 If the presenter does not sound as though
 
the material is important, he actually has the effect of putting it down.
 Some
 
of our presenters, festival-wide, were just too laid back and quiet.
 
We needed presenters for the lace makers; one was a good talker, the other two
 
were monosyllabic in responses.
 This was awfully rough on the lady that talked.
 
Lace-making is not an archaic craft, by the way.

oxexati4zwexzaaiiy One of the lace makers actually sang; we could have

Lme to go
 
develop it.  At the festival i
t is even possible that we could have
 
developed a singing group from among the lace ladies (
a la the Old Believers
; ,;
 
in Regional) but that didn't get done.  We really could have used two
 
full time professional folklorists in Old Ways, one to work on present ations
 -
` I '  
and one to wazkzaz do Susan's job.
 
A possible model for future festival would be to assign one permanent
 
foklorist-presenter per stage; then bring in the folklorist field worker$
 
who had gotten the presentation together and no assistant presenter.
 
This would give us the advantage of cooperation between partixa$azzHzVextgz
 
aadxexpgztzxeaz:pzasagtakim people who knew the material very well and
 
people with presentational experience.  Each week we had t
o start from
 
scratch with people who were learning what worked and what didn't -- very
 
inefficient.
 
The Belgians did not feel good about themselves.  The harmonica player
 
wanted to go home the first day.  The Egyptians wiped them out even in
 
rehearsal at Georgetown and it upset the Belgians.
 It really did not
 
work; it was a weak presentation and putting them opposite the Egyptians
 
was diastrous.  We did not get away with this -- we should not have done
 
it.
 It was a poor performance, and further intensifies our recommendation
 
that given as six hour schedule, you cannot do a presentation with so few
 
people (
plus with such a weak culture).

German and German-American music both seemed a bit the same; the German
 
being more varied.
 A lot of omm pah pah without much distinctiveness;
 
that may reflect just what there is.
 German American music was not that
 
different from region to region though the hockbrett was very- fin
e
 
The Langenshiltach group did their job but it was all sort of bland.
 
Apparently the German participants were chosen this year to make the
 
tour easy -- not real strong individuals except for Ziggy Lott (
jewsharp
 
and hand made instrument player) -- he was a real person.
 Ursula also
 
a distinctive individual, very special.  Though she had her postcards
 
and all and was a bit commercial, she was a woman who had lived her life
 
on the street and she wxx had a real identit*.
 She was so anxious to
 
get to her organ that she tore the crate apart practically with her
 
hands to get at it (
it had been lost z for a while during shipping.)
 
Ziggy was a very playful guy, loves performing and making people happy.
 
Aside from the Langenshiltach, it was clarinets and accordions all week.
 
Crafts -- hochbrett maker (his wife demonstrated food).
 He also wanted
 
to play, and did on the main stage and in the food demo tent.
 A very
 
strong willed man.
 
Some of the Germans had been here before, and were warm and friendly.
 
Roger Welch had thought of comparing different German communities in the
 
U
.S,  and brought groups from several different ethnic communities.
 The
 
Amana Iowa group is into preservation, are trying to restore their
 
town into a 19th century German village -- sort of a Sturbridge Village.
 
They sent young people; all spoke German and very absorbed in their
 
German heritage.
 A very solid German tradition in that area.
 The Mequan
 
Wisconsin area sent an older group, very inter-related; did more religious
 
MUSIC.
 
Roger and Tony did a good job of presented; Conrad did not do much at all.
 
Tony, Genie thinks, actually did a better job than Roger who lived in a
 
hotel and did not get the evening experience with the performers.  He did,
 
however, have a good relationship with all the performers because he knew
 
them well.
 Roger, Tony and Hana (
the cultural liason) had all worked together
 
past year, so they knew each other well and things went very smoothly.
 
In comparison with Austria and Switzerland, Germany didn't have the pageantry
 
of the other presentations -- just the solid music for beer halls tradition.
 
Perhaps this is due to increased industrialization in Germany -- more of the
 
urban scene.
 
The other German American area was kkw Nebraska, but still all clarinets and
 
cornets.
 The r
daaxexsxwHas Langenshiltach dancers were prettier this year
 
than last; almost all married -- again, they wanted to have a smooth tour.
 
Overall, however, there were very few women -- German American group had only
 
one; Germans only :
kaxxx five.
 Hanna is very good as a cultural liason.
 
Logistics of the tour went very well because the team had worked together before
 
r �rr-
" MI  P.
 
German embassy party was much better this year than last; last year they
 
almost ushered them out.

(
With Austria, the beer should be warm rather than c
old.
 Our beer generally .
_
Otf t :
 
was weaker than Europeans like.  Germans were very proud to  be  out-
drinking (
as they thought) everybody else, but actually the Belgians were
 
the top beer consumers on the mall.)
 
Overall complaint from Genie was the price of the f
ood at Georgetown;
 
she went there every evening when her countries were in and she simply
 
could not afford to eat there.  The excuse that the price was kept high
 
in order to keep students from coding in dzdx
i:kzwozkxbReaaxe was irrelevant
 
because all staff had tags anyway.  Generally the kitchen people in
 
Georgetown however were very cooperative and friendly.

Tom objects to most of Genie's analysis:
 
1
.
 Hana was the finest cultural liason of the whole summer.
 The hardest working ,
 
mother hen with a tremendously fine disposition.
 (Tom)
 Susan says there were
 
others as good.
 She worked with both the Austiians and Germans and wanted to
 
work with the Swiss but Shirley wouldn't hire her on the grounds that we needed
 
someone tri-lingual.
 
2
.
 German field work suffered from the fact that Tom did not have enough time to
 
spend in Germany.
 Conrad is a fine folklorist but so far the kind of field
 
work we need has not been done really in Germany.
 He doesn' understand or
 
have experience with digging for repertoire and people, and because of time
 
shortage, Tom had to leave it mostly an his hands.  We agreed to b&gin with
 
on repeating with Langenshiltach because they had been successful last year
 
and because we werea little panicky about how much folklore there was left in
 
Germany.
 Tom wouldn't have them again -- they're getting turned into Sturbridge
 
Village by over exposure; it probably is revival anyway rather than survival.
 
The inclusion of the street organ player was well worth it; generally the
 
presentation was much more varied than last year's programmatically.
 Ursula
 
was in many ways the most successful single presentation we had; she should
 
not have been put on the stage, however but left to wander around the grounds.
 
Susan had her in the activities center and she was great there; even without
 
a translator she was incredible and with one she was even better.
 
People k just loved her.
 We did everything wrong -- she should have been here
 
for the entire festival and we should have had her donkey and anything else she
 
wanted.
 
Both Roger and Conrad are folklorists with special folkloristic biases -- kakk
 
mazaziaxtkexRayaaxGxeagxeampz -khaaxza  Roger really gets to the im public level
 
mostly, rarely gets to the private tradition because ha�KzXOtzxeaiiYxiatazasteAz
 
zazitx may not g make that distinction or he may not have time to get to it.
 
Also, he's male, and he gets the male level - the sitting around drinking beer
 
sort of activity.zatkexzt
:hxaxtkexokharxaati$itiexzx  Conrad also counts on being
 
able to get in and get out fast because, like Roger, he's on a tight academic
 
schedule.
 We really wonder if anybody is g doing any field work either in
 
Germany a or among German Americans
 
Conrad never sent his tapes until it was too late; there was a lot of similarity
 
in instrumentation coming in from Germany; as Genie says, accordios and clarinets.
 
We were successful in presenting the low key types of instrumental ensembles
 
from Germany, both brass and woodwind
 
German-American - Susan interviewed six of the Amana group all of whome talked
 
about from whom they had learned their traditiona.
 We should have brought one
 
or two of

osapke along with the Amana youngster s `
'
 also kept talking
 
about reli 2o
 us music but t
,
�-`didn't do it, deferring to these older people
 
(who were I�t there).
 Roger brought the young people but they kept talking about
 
the old pepple.
 (Good exmple of Roger's approach -- a bit surfacy.)
 
(Bob B

feeling that it is, in contemporary terms, more authentic.

 I
le had been a playing parLicipant last summer
 
xkagw but was asked to do craft demo alone this summer; it seemed to create
 
some pressure.
 Roger didn't think it would but apparently it did, even
 
though he played in his craft demonstration booth.
 
Tony was pleasant and self assured but neither he nor Roger gave very much
 
information on stage.
 
frmm last year
 
Mequan group was a small representation from a large marching band that we
 
had last year.
 Much nicer group than the large blaskapeller but they
 
did not play religious music, as Genie said they did. We did not have the
 
large obnoxious leder-hosen group from Washington that taught dancing
 
last year; they monopolozed everything axdxwazwax (
sponsored by the Embassy)
 
awd but we were successful in avoiding them this year.
 A great relief.
 
Tom feels that an awful lot more can be done on German-American field work.
 
Bess and Susan suggest trying Texas German communities another time --
New Braunsfels, Fredericksburg.
 Tom says a number of communities Roger
 
has never hit -- New Olm Minnesota, Rhinelander, Wisconsin -- a number of
 
farm communities of this E
lk kind where a more variegated tradition might be
 
found.
 We have, for example, hardly ever had any song tradition in our
 
German American presentation, and Tom thinks it must still be around; it
 
may possibly have died out in Germany -- at least Tom couldn't find anything
 
in Hamburg where there used toxx be a song tradition centered around the
 
waterfront.
 
People felt that the German stuff sounded much the same; Susan and Tom feel
 
this was a result of a lack luster presentation.  Neither Roger nor Tony
 
worked very -ard at it; for example, the Amana community were a fascinating
 
group to hear about kHk as a well as to hear but nothing was made of this
 
ddring the presentation on stage, only in the activity center.
 
Again, the American groups tended to be left on their own to do their own
 
self-presenting, resulting in routine programming, just giving the titlesw of
 
what they would play and playing - not doing anything like tagking about where
 
they learned them or what they meant.
 
Almost all the music in both the German and German-American programs was played
 
from score, which says a lot about the state of the art.

AUSTRIA
 
In spite of all the political hassles, the material from Austria turned
 
out to be among the most varied and rewarding programs of the summer.
 
Tom had less time for field work in Austria than he had wanted; we got all
 -1
,;
 
of the material we wanted that he saw and we had good people suggesting the
 
rest later.
 They had to work behind the scenes for political reasons (
Schuller
 
Thiel et al).
 Christian Feest,w an anthropologist, was set up as the
 
political straw man -- he was a neutral figure politically and had worked
 
previously with Bill Sturtevant.
 Being an anthropologist and interested in
 
Native American material, a
te he could not be accused of folkloristic bias.
 
He did a superb job of rounding up the troops, providing documentation and was
 
an excellent presenter.
 
The sorts of things we got from Austria were extremely unusual and very
 
enlightening to the American public; the embassy was delighted.
 They chose
 
thde absence of the ambassador to throw a big party for us.
 
Austrian-American material was vastly exexskaxoAwsdxbyzXhu overshadowed by the
 
Austrian,  extremely weak by contrast and in its own terms.
 Tom is not
 
convinced that Tony Hellen�erg is the best field worker we could have gotten.
 
He's kind of a fragile invididual; also he and Genie did a lot of the stuff
 
on the phone together.
 It was a tough field work assignment because the
 
Austrians are pretty mixed up with the Germans in the US all over -- however,
 
he's a bit of an ineffectual sort of person and didn't go at the field work
 
with any kind of bang.
 Whaxzkex Some of what he got was unusual but he relied
 
a lot on what we were doing here (in Old Ways)  to find leads Hkxx and evaluate;
 
he sort of didn't take over himself.
 
The dance group from Chicago had only about 2 or 3 numbers really in their
 
repertoire; how authentic it was we're not sure.
 (The Austrians were kind of
 
astounded or amused.)
 Very strange formation style carrying white and green
 
A's but nobody ever knew what it stood for.
 (American Airlines?  Austria?
 
America?*  Adultery?)
 The other group was the Dick Theml group which tended
 
to be schmaltzy.
 Heidi yodelled (the Austrians thought it was awful)t but the
 
Americans loved it).
 
The Austrian Fastnacht people worked out very well in the activities center;
 
the costumes attracted an audience immediately, and they talked well $kmx
 
through a translater about the village customs, the meaning of the costumes
 
etc.
 Sebastian Pfaund&er was assistant presenter (frmm Austria) is bright,
 
just starting medical school, interested in folk medicine; made a good pre-
senter.)
 Feest and Pfaundler were 8 very easy and accomodating people to
 
work with, helped with iR activities center et al.
 Tony was a worse presenter
 
this summer than last, Tom thinks; Susan also says he was weak, but he was
 
getting a hard time (like Richard March) was k getting a hard time from
 
Linda Degh -- both being I
.U.  students and she not being a supporter of the
 
FAF.
 Generally, Susan thinks T6ny tends to respond to people rather than
 
to generate anything himself.
 
Heidi's mother did embroidery; a good display with a historical slant - you
 
could trace how her designs developed through time, using new materials etc.
 
Heidi also wore the clothes her mother made for her on the stage and spoke
 
about them.

Tom:
 the Swiss program was the most successful
. of all Old Ways programs
 
for the summer in both foreign and domestic components.
 Certainly it was
 
the best integrated, tremendously good feelings throughout all of the
 
participants.
 Any of the fears we might have had about factionalism
 
among the Swiss rapidly disappeared.
 (RSSus an  doesn't think it was the
 
best program -- probably the Irish -- but certainly it was up at the top.)
 
Certainly some of the strongest good feelings all summer long (
this is
 
Susan) -- everybody liked and admired everybody else.
 
The only sore part of the Swiss Swiss was the Appenzel group who are fairly
 
slick, not really professional, but they tended to stay off by themselves
 
thinking of themselves as a cut above.
 (
They had been to the US before.)
 �
r
}+
 
WRzkadzazietzuixpxekiEEmazxikhxtrkomz  They were difficult to begin with
 
they were not the group Birgette anti Tom wanted to bring txzhegznzxikhy anyway.   
 
Birgitte and David Bjork worked very well together.
 Both were good presenters.
 
David did good field work - his xxzxu choice of the two belt wrestlers was
 
fine; he found the Sxtzrisx4x  Ax Sartoris  (
the Italian Swiss Americans),
 
got a good range of ages.
 Also in the Swiss presentation generally, there
 
were a reasonable number of women; whereas in many of the Old Ways presentations
 ,
 
there were almost no women.
,
 
One very unifying factor for the group was the morning parade and forming the
 
circle.
 This was done also by the Belgians but not so successfully; with
 
the Swiss you got a terrific feeling of unity.  It was a quick programmatic
 
decision xk on how to present the whip cracking, alphorn and flag throwing
 
and it worked very well (
Birgitte, David and Tom worked this out.)  Using
 
the alpho rn at the end of the day was Brigitte's idea and also worked well,
 
sort of like taps.  (Throughout the summer, Susan say,s the gxbkH various
 
ways to begin and end the day was discussed; there seemed to be a general
 
Rx  need to do this formally - n
.b.  for future festivals.)
 
Swiss and Swiss Americans were extremely outgoing; seemed to like to talk
 
to mH people and audiences.  Were beautiful in the activities center.
 
Two zither players, the woman spoke English and the man very little but
 
they worked inxxi very well - taught people how to play simple tunes and so
 
on.
 (The Ulrichs).
 The leaf blowing and broom playing workships in the
 
activities centers were probably the biggest successes of the entire summer.
 
The alp horn carver worked out very well; people were very interested and
 
the gentleman was a good explained very well considering he had almost no
 
English.
 
Wrestlers was the best sport demonstration of the entire summer.
 Actually,
 
we did a lot of things xxtgzxe with the Swiss that we also did with the
 
Belgians, but in the case of the Belginas it didn't work so well, partly
 
because there were fewer of them and partly because the Swiss tradition is
 
just a stronger performance tradition.
 The particular wrestlers were extremely
 
articulate and handled their own presentation beautifuly (needed no presenter).
 
Overall, the Swiss program was extraordinarily varied and all of its components
 
worked together beautifully.

MEXICO
 
Sosouv
 
Irini and Salvador did a remarkable job o
f selecting real stuff for us
 
in Mexico, although i
t was difficult t
o keep in communication with them
 
before hand.  All the Mexican skxii material and performers were first
 
rate and from the right level.  John McDowell and Hector were both
 
excellent presenters; R John was a bit of a cold fish and didn't work
 
nearly a
s hard a
s Hector who not only presented but did t
.l.c. and negotiated
 
vithzxz with Irini and Salvador.
 
There were endless preliminary hassles RxR at the beginning a
bout presentation
 
with Irini, Hector, Salvador et al.  The other main problem was the media
 
blitz -- Frank* and Mike recording, Herb Shore's wife, R John Marshall
 
and the NBC crew filming.  There was far too much documentation and as a
 
result the Mexican performers got over-performed.  It was already a
 
c
onfusing week, since we were cross}ng back and f
orth with Regional performers
 
(
the Banda was split between Regional and Old Ways), and because we were
 
trying t
o f
ill up Anna's stage, since she had n o foreign component from
 
Spain.  The result of all this was pretty chaotic.
 
Hector and John finally worked out that John would take care of the per-
formers when they had to go any place else than their own stage, so John
 
brought them t
o the activity center and the main stage, e
tc.  2xixaRox;
 
zkzkaxandxout*zdzdzxokzsp$akzkaxdiyxaxyxE-Rgizsh;xtziaizdzd  This didn't work
 
too well as John tended to disappear.
 Salvador wasn't much help generally
 
since he turned out to speak almost no English; Irini -- who was not invited
 
did turn up from time to time and helpout. Bascially, Hector did the work
 
and as a result developed laryngitis since the others just left him out.
 
Hector, like Dan Sheehy, was endlessly good natured; if we had not had them
 
there we would have had endless problems.
 
It was perhaps a mistake to have two jarrocho groups; the MuAxi Mexican
 
far outshone the oxzgiHaizxzWhRsxtkexoxe domestic and we probably should
 
have cancelled that presentation when the original domestic jarrocho we
 
wanted couldn't come.
 TkH It was really too bad that we lost the marimba.
 
We probably should have gone ahead and gotten even a not-so-hot norteno;
 
the-P-
_%,C
a Papgo group didn't really fit too well, though they came and played
 
with a nice cooperative spirit.
 The banda, on the other hand, was successful.
 
Except for the farm workers from Regional, it was a tough week in the activities
 
center; none of the other performers liked to talk about what they were doing,
 
they just wanted to perform.
 This may have been exikaxal a cultural feature,
 
since none of them talked well or freely and even in the dorms seemed to want
 
to play all the time, both foreign and domestic.
 The craft demonstrations
 
were excellent but could have used some presenting; the sxakexoszWexexbRaxtifK1
 
carvings were beautiful, far nicer than last year's.
 Since there were two
 
pmopfRzdoi santeros,  it would have been nice to get a dialogue going between.
 
them but we zkoxiAzkaxexhx needed a presenter to do that.
 
Susan suggests that another time we might consider not doing crafts con-
tinuously but having shorter, somewhat planned programs for craftsmen so that
 
they can be effectively presented, or maybe a combination of both.
 She says
 
them people who really did talk were absolutely exhausted at the end of the
 
day and really shouldn't have been worked so hard.
 
The Mexican program always got off to a very slow start in the morning.
 Starting
 
with the Indians made good historical sense but poor programming; you really
 
I( 
needed to work up t
o them.  There was also no integration a
t all between
 
the Mexican and Mexican American material programmati
.catly speaking.
 
Probably all of Hispanic week was sufferend from over-complexity;a d
 
we just bit off more than we could chew probably.  All three of us (
Tom,
 
Bess, Susan) don't remember individuals well from this week; there was
 
so much c
onfusion, so many areas of idssension, so much activity in
 
general (
parades, negotiations about filminag, Tom spent a lot of time
 
in Native, Bess in Regional) that no clear impression about any single
 
part of the program remains.

one very largr pr

;arl-arn KC was in Tsrale s
he had given

,e American isxapk contingent :
could
 
not contain former Israelis.
 The fact tht it did raised problems throughout
 
the week.
 (The Yemenites and the scribe and the Succoth lady are all former
 
Israelis.)
 It seems unlikely, however, that Barbara would have agreed to
 
this and then violated her agreement; she probably said, if it's possible,
 
or something of the kind. There is a lot of resentment among Israelis that
 
emigration has occurred, so it made.!for bad interpersonal relationships
 
on the mall.
 
field worker
 
Shiffra was/responsible for the badkhn (wedding jester)g who upset both
 
the American Jews, the. Israelis, the audiences and the S
jmithsonian.
 Barbara
 
had heard a tape f and felt very badly also.
 Jeffery feels that if Barbara
 
were doing a rep at, she would have worked up a very different domestic
 
program.
 She wa  satisfied with the Israeli program. Although she and
 
Uri didn't get a ong well, B did say that he had done an excellent job of
 
coordination.
 
This is one program where you must take into account the cultural personality
 
style; Israelis are immensely aggressive and don't really worry about other
 
people's feelings, esepcially Americans.
 
Another problem with the Israelis was too many presenters (
4 American); they
 
did nothing and got in the way.
 The crafts were not presented at all.
 Pam,
 
who worked with the Kurds was probably the best, since she knew exactly
 
what her function was, to take care of the Kurds.
 Dena and Uri both had
 
Yemenites and they fought over them.
 Shiffra did shofar workshops at the
 
activities center and picked up around the edges; she was useful as a translator
 
and generally energetic.
 During the field work period, she organized the
 
entire isxaa Jewish delegation, relieving Barbara of much preparatory work.
 
Reyzel was brought with the Yiddish singers; she was a bit of a nag.
 
Overall, mNs1zHfxtke many of the problems had to do with first week problems.
 
Dan Ronin (
from Israel) did an excellent job in keeping the Israeli group
 
together.
 He presented the modern stuff and tended to take over with the
 
accordion, each day his part of the program got a little longer.
 The
 
Israeli program qas really well planned, including middle eastern elements
 
that most Americans do not associate with Israel and included also the
 
familiar standard Israeli.
 Folklorically speaking, a good balance of the
 
familiar and the educational.
 
Barbara planned much more imaginatively than most field workers.
 She insisted
 
for example on not just having the wedding procession, but in having the
 
bride dressed-in the traditional style in the learning center prior to the
 
parade.
 This was immednsely successful.
 Barbara suffered from the cutback
 
the mandolin
 
e

U
 
the mandolin orchestra was well received and if she had been allowed t
o
 
keep it longer, it would have helped the program.  She had already invited some

when the cruch came and would have chosen a different 18 than the ones she had.

Frist week problems:
 transportation 1
% was not working well and we had
 r
 
a chronic shortage of supplies.
 Overall, many of the Israeli week  roblems

were du  to such factors.

Crafts:  we needed presenters in w th the calligrapher; by the end of 6
`
 �.
 
week, the staff understood the flow problems better and arranged the
 
crafts in a bit more useful a xa way.  We didn't have the sewing machine
 
and ironing board the tailor needed, plus no presenter.
 
Barbara commented that the cognate idea does not work well presentationally
 
because it doesn't give you enough vez!satility to fill up the stage long
 
enough.  Nazir also remarked on this.
 
All presenters complained about the main stage and the necessity of going
 
there.
 a
.
 They thought the stage itself was a horrible place to perform,
 
people couldn't hear one another playing.  b
.
 It was much too exhausting
 
to have to go back and forth down to that area. They all, however, had praise
 
for the main stage people -- Bill Pearson and Al in particular.
 (
The
 
only program that the main stage worked well with was the Egyptian; a lot
 
of the American Egyptians enjoyed the main stage for some reason.)
 
_Everybody liked the evening concert, however.
 
(Overall, Jefferey reports that all his countries thought they  were worked
 
too hard and were over-scheduled.)
 
Most performers did not like to eat before they performed; so the hour before
 
their main stage evening concert, hardly any of them ate, and then-t

Barbara located almost all the crafts that were sold and really researched
 
them.
 Th&se were our finest ethnic folk crafts, but they did not sell.
 
The things that sold were the tacky mezuzahs and stuff like that.
 Actually
 
'
the sales area needed another presenter who could explain the crafts being
 
i
sold and why they were chosen.
 (When the British guy was sitting there
 
playing the tin whistle, they sold a lot of tin whistles.
 e
.g.)  Also Scandi-
navian week, there were a lot of lovely ornaments but nobody explained what
 
they were and so people didn't buy them.
 Our crafts sales require the same
 
(
kind of t
.l.c.  in presentation khaaxaxx as our other presentation§ and the
 
people we had this past summer simply sold, they didn't know anything interesting.
 
in Old Ways
 
Crafts sales/had to be separate from the activity; Susan thinks maybe this
 
was a bad idea.
 
There was a real effort made in Old Ways to get Jewish people there in th
 
audience -- Barbara insisted on this and worked on it herself.
 Barbara gave
 
out information, brochures etc. with very little engendered from Roschwalb.
 
Old Ways people contacted Jewsih Community centers etc.  to good effect.
 The
 
Jewish social structure made this pretty easy to do actually.
 The American
 
Jewish community used the newsletters, and this route is important for other
 
ethnic communities another year.
 We should try to get into the ethnic informationa
:
 
system.

In future festivals, there should be someone in Press t
o spend maximum
 
time contacting ethnic communities.  The press f
olks were not only inefficient
 
but uncooperative with both Tom and Jeffery (
and Bess )
.  hmwassz*
 
In the Learning Center there were many many interviews with Jews that week
 
indicating that there was a large percentage of Jews attending the festival kkak
 
then.  They discussed the presentation, critically -- both positive and negative
 
JkzxaxzpixiHzkhat  The large amoujnt of community ethnic presence was a real bonus
 
for the overall presentation -- .the performers felt good, the area kind of ha hummed
 
and the audience could be actually involved.
 
4&eaexaiiy�x
 
Uri said that he felt this festival was an immense success and he and the other Israelis
 
were really surprised at the reception to the exotic material.  He thought this would
 
turn around the Israeli governments tendency t
o try to homogenize traditions.
 
Barbara thus has to be especially thanked by us for persisting exexzkhazxhez$
-Zgzapked
 
gxoHps in spite of their scheduling all the choreographed groups on getting to the
 
real level we wanted to present.
 It had a good effect not only on this festival but
 
in the home country as well. Jeffery thinks this ability to persist and make out points
 
well is a critical factor in field workers we send overseas.  Barbara had not worked
 
at the Festival before but she had observed it and knew what worked well.  Halim also
 
did this in Egypt and Nazir in Pakistan.
 They have to be people who really know and
 
understand not only the traditions but who will not back down in front of governmental
 
reluctance.  A prime example ware the Bhangra dancers in India; kkay
. Nazir had to insist
 
and insist simply to have them included; they turned out to be so essential to the
 
presentation axx that the Indian government paid Sxpk extra to take them on tour.)
 
All of these pRapiax field workers (
Barbara, Nazir et al) were also extremely persistent
 
in writing back t
o the countries after they left and insisting UK that the program
 
not be changed.a:i
 
This was a veryh exciting week because i
t was one of the most s creative weeks.  Jeffery
 
feels this is in large part due to Barbara who he would recommend earnestly for future
 
festivalsx as a field worker and planner and presenter.
 Fantastic as a presenter.

JAPAN

So easy.  Well organized, they helps, they don't complain, they anticipate. - 
Mr. Yamaji was the best gxxx foreign group leader of the whole summer;
 
he was definitely in charge, he respected the opinions of all tkRX his charges
 
and was interested in their welfare, would jump in and help.  When they
 
arrived, he made signs with their names in Japanese and put them xa up zazaiiz
 
on their doors so they could find each other in the dorm (good thought).
 
(He was the folklorist and leader).
 
All of the stage set up was smoothly handled - overall well organized.
 
Ralph Samuelson was the m ost efficient field worker Jefferey had to deal
 
with -- filled in all the cards, wrote letters, got along perfectly with
 
the performers, anticipated problems so that Jeff could deal with them in
 
advance.
 His presentations were low key, informative and short.
 
He did resist our suggestion to come on stage and explain more frequently
 
(
because thex presentation, both puppet and kagora were so lengthy); however,
 
he finally did it reluctantly and Jeff and Susan thought it helped.
 
Certainly the audiences stayed around through long long programs.
 The Japanese
 
themselves were so decorous and polite in demeanor that they affected the
 
audience which didn't talk as much as usual, stayed longer etc.
 
L
.
 
(
NB Alan's/sugges:kzxa that the relaxed atmosphere we tried to set up to
 
enable is one to one interactions between audience and performers diminished
 
slightly the effect of really smashing performances -- except where the
 
performances themselves were as rowdy and gutsy as the Egyptians.
 Overall
 
he felt the atmosphere was so relaxed and laid back that it wxx verged on
 
the disorderly and inconsequential.
 Bess thinks this is true in part but
 
he didn't see many of the programs where other things did occur.)
 
Patia's finding the Yanos was great.  Mrs. Yano played the bewa -- really fine
 
artist.
 As a field worker Patia she was fine, wrote informatively in advance.
 
The Japnese and Japanese Americans loved her - she got along very well with
 
both groups.
 Miko, who had had mixed feelings at the end of the summer because
 
she was offended with RR for some reason, ended this summer feeling very good
 
Tom thinks we could have worked it out to have the bon dances done completely
 
with live music if we had worked earlier at it.
 Certainly the live music was
 
better from our gaxx point of view  and the dancers didn't seem to dislike it
 
Everybody including Miko liked the live music.  Miko did a fine job in the
 
field, getting the material together quickly and efficiently; also she worked
 
well on the mall.
 She helped presenting the cooks and crafts and a bit on the
 
stage.
 Ralph did most of the Japanese presentation on stage and Patia presented
 
the Yanos; Patia was really essential to them and did a nice job.  Miko said
 
that she felt much better this year because she had been here the year before
 
and thus wasn't as nervous or uptight; Ralph S
. said the same thing.
 It is apparentl_.
;. 
a good idea to have the same field workers/presenters repeating; they give off
 
a lot of secure feelings to the performers.
 The same thing applies to the perfoemers�-?'*r 
who repeat  (
there were a couple from Japan plus the Seabrook people).
 That
 
helped a lot -- the Seabrook people brought extra rice because they knew the
 
Japanese wouldn't like the American style and they cooked it up in the dorm at
 
night.

Miko found one of our most successful crafts demonstrators of the summer --
Mrs. Takahashi - the sand painter.
 She did excellent workshops (a very o
ld
 
tradition, going back to the 700dreds A
.D.).
 
have had
 
Tour guide$  commented that everybody seemed to bRzhaxzxg fun -- not noisy
 
boisterous fun but very civilized fun -- "very symbolic" he thought.
 
Susan had mixed impressk
.ons of patia in the Activities Center (
she did most
 
of her presenting there).
 She seemed to get on well with the Japanese,
 
she kind of threw people off because of her sort of non-standard kinesics
 
and speech stylezxz2hf
fzwaazkowexex (Americans, that is).
 She was knowledgeable,
 
a good translator, but she did have a kind of sense of inferiority -- a
 
sort of "I can't do this" which was not born out by her actions in the Activity
 
Center.
 She is a western trying to be A
 Japanese, and it makes interaction
 
with her a little sort of off center.
 RRxfoi In g actual performance, she was
 
very good.
 
Moshe demonstration was extremely successful (
too bad it doesn't taste better).
 
It was outdoors -- outdoor cooking much the best -- and they involved the
 
audience in doing the pounding -- a very happy experience all around including
 
Japanese, and Japanese Americans.
 An important point here was that this
 
demonstration was near the stage and when they did it, they closed the stage
 
down and brought the audience over.
 This was one program in which the food
 
really got integrated into the overall presentation. Jeffery suggested this,
 
by the way.
 
The Japanese presentation -- performers and field workers -- was one of the
 
happiest and best balanced and best integrated presentation of the summer.
 
They all got along together and didn't pull against each other.
 Tkny
 
The bon dance during the last two or three dances they stopped and said they
 
wouldn't dance any more unless the Americans joined in and they finally got
 
really good audience participation.
 Very happy and looked lovely.
 
Sumiko Biderman - cultural xwixaxexx liason -- suggested that IVIS volunteers
 
should be scheduled by her so that they could get relieved regularly and be
 
where they were needed; of when coordinated by IVIS, this didn't seem to happen
 
as smoothly.
 Jeffery feels that cultural liasons were indispensible -- helped
 
immensely, not only in just talking with the folks but in settling disputes and
 
keeping things moving smoothly.
 They often could tell you whether a disagreement
 
was really significant or whether the staff should get involved or not etc.
 By
 
and large Jeffery feels they were well selected.
 
IVIS had a varied level of commitments and were not well organized by their own
 
people.
 While they were there, they were reliable, but you couldn't count on
 
their coming ahead of time.
 They served an excellent purpose while there.
 
In dishing out and serving the i
doche, they :
pH had two tables so that a lot
 
more people could be accomodated.
 Sort of cooking in thr round -- an area
 
roped off so that a lot of people could see, as well as be serv59bple
 
T gn fHjycaja q�Lhi  was also th e best  of the summer
 - the same
/as  las t summe

but this year they improved enormously.

EGYPT
 
Magda Saleh was probably the best presenter J
. worked with, and possibly
 
of the entire Festival.
 When Jefferey told her that, she w said, "Well,
 
that's show biz".
 Coming from ballet, trying to get some more Egyptian
 
style (
rather than straight Russian) into the company, she became interested
 
in Egyptian folkdance and is now writing her PhD on the subject.
 She's
 
also making a documentary film on Egyptian folk dance.
 She spoke fluid
 
Arabic because she's Egyptian; her mother was Scottish, so she had excellent
 
English.
 She got in a lot g of information and handled the presentation
 
of erotic movement extremely beautifully, without being condescending,
 
coy or in any way embarrassing either the performers or the audience.
 
Halim's field work was superb; his presentation was not all that good --
a bit too laid back and soft spok6n.
 He dislikes conflict and will avoid
 
it wherever possible.
 On every other level, he was superb. His interpersonal
 
relations with everybody were excellent.
 
Both Nazir and Halim had the same problem:
 that tkexpxopiRzwhi& almost
 
everyone who comes to this country from the middle east comes from the
 
intellectual or professional stratum, so that it is extremely difficult
 
to find folk traditions
 We had an extremely small domestic component
 
(only about 14) Egyptian-American; considering how few there were, they
 
had a lot of versatility.
 He was very hxpxrEd hampered by the budget cut;
 
had wanted to bring a church group, which he could not.wit (The Copts
 
-- domestic -- did liturgy; man who played oud and wife who drummed;
 
fellow who played the ney, a dolakh player and a dancer -- all of these
 
domestic.)

A really very smooth week.
 The main problems were food and tea; they
 
really needed more middle eastern food available to them -- more sp ce,
 
lamb, etc.
 The lunches were really not any good for them.
 Marriot�
�really
 
went out of their way to put out food that would be attractive for the
 
vazrious peoples throughout the summer.
 Plus the fact they offered a
 
significant choice made everybody feel good.  '
 
The food demo was a trouble -- the food demo lady didn't speak much
 
English and had two children who occupied a lot of her time.
 Jeffery
 
feels that food demos in general were not really worth while except for
 
such things as the Japanese moshe demo  (
this was done outdoors).
 
Perhaps a presenter using a pig nose would have helped in explaining the
 
preparation style of food.
 Susie's suggestion of a larger demo area
 
with the audience inside the screen was seconded.
 
Food sales wRx -- the programmatic value was great, but there was no
 
appropriate control once the people got here and started serving.
 Some
 
of the food was overpriced and nobody controlled it; there wasn't really
 
anybody who was in charge of the food sales on the mall.
 
There was a similar problem with crafts -- there didn't seem to be anyone
 
whose job it was to keep an eye on quality control after xhxRxmxxpmR
 
everyone got to the mall.
 If new craft items were added, posters put
 
up on food sales areas, or changes made in menus or prices , the re  was

PAKISTAN
 
The level of performance was fabulous and the Pakistanis had some of the most
 
interesting and colorful characters of the summer.
 Some of them developed cult
 
f
ollowers by the end of the week.  People really fell inlove with some of the
 
Pakistanis.
 
Nazir's fieldwork was outstanding.  He got 80% of what he wanted; a 100% would
 
have blown us away.
 
Gordon Thompson was a very good assistant presenter and a nice person who got
 
along with staff, and participants andNazir beautifully and was extremely help-
ful and cheerful all the time.
 
Nazir was excellent on the stage as a presenter but he really bloomed in the
 
Activity Center dealing with the musicians one at a time and extracitng amaz-
ing amounts of material from them on the music and insturments.  He would be
 
an ideal for presenters to learn from.
 On the area stage the gave short, pithy,
 
informative, sincere and often humorous introductions and explanations.  His
 
respect for the musicians was obvious and catching and his humane treatment
 
of the participants was also fobservable.
 
Constant tea was necessary for the participants; they got it from Jeffrey.
 
The Egyptians and later, the Egyptians also needed tea.  Jeff made the tea,
 
bought it and carried it out in pitchers  a couple times a day.
 
The domestic program was rather weak.  Nazir had to choose them before he
 
knew what was coing from Pakistan and hence many of them did not fit in well
 
with the final program. - Also most  Pakistanis in this country are professionals
 
and are t
oo far removed from their "roots" to be terribly useful in a folk
 
festival.
 
Mufti was a sinsiter, and demoralizing influence.  He was less repulsive on
 
the Mall but embarassingly awful duridng rehearsals.
 Participants were
 
afraid of him., since many of their jobs and livelihoods depended on him when
 
they returned to Pakistan.) I
vey wouldn't do anything without his permission.
 
Nazir found Mufti very cooperative, however and he didn't seem to have any
 
effect on performance.
 
The f
ood was also a f
problem for them- it wasn't what they were used to.
 
(
Thompson spoke Urdu (
impressing lots of the participants), was comical and
 
humerous, excellent stage presence; excellent personality.  Nazir recommended
 
him - he is a former student now at Indiana.)
 
Nazir felt that Mufti had really done a good job in that anything that Nazir
 
a
sked for eventually got done.  Jeffery counters that the means employed didn't
 
justify the ends.
 If we want to do anything again in Pakistan, Mufti is a
 
good person to stay on the good side of.
 
Overall, hot drinks are important for participants coming in from abroad;
 
e
specially singers were not used to all the ice that we have available.

Nazir was hurt by the cognate idea -- when he went around l
ie chose people
 
(on the domestic side) like one Pushto, one Sind etc.  in order to work with
 
the variant groups he thought he would be getting $a (and actually did in
 
most cases)  from Pakistan.
 Jeffery thinks the domestic presentation would.
 
have been stronger if he had chosen a local community group of a larger size
 
(
somewhat like the bhangra group in the Indian presentation).
 Tkixzwaxzkx0
 
axaktPxadx  Of course this may not have been possible with American Pakistanis.
 
One of the main things that made Nazir a good presenter was that he was very
 
creative; he would try things, and if they worked well he would try the same
 
thing with other people.  He believed in experimenting both in the field and
 
on the mall; was extroardinarily flexible and changed the program, keeping
 
everyone fresh and interested.
 
Hefferey suggests that a two weeks stay would be much better per group;
 
one possibility might be to bring groups in on a staggered schedule, starting
 
with only one country for one two week period, then bringing in a second
 
starting week 2 for two weeks.
 That way there would always be some variety
 
of presentation, but the xa staff would also have to handle only one new
 
group per week.
 Also if you had them for two weeks, they could do something
 
nice on Monday and Tuesday and start the second week with high morale; this
 
way we seem to throw them out before they've had time to relax and see
 
Washington.

Cognate idea.
 A lot of f
ield workers ignored the principle.
 Those
 
who didn't suffered, because likely enough either the foreign or
 
the domestic was better making for dissension.
 As a result, the
 
reinforcement wazxtHzi&exa that was to occur didn't happen; Jeffery
 
thinks that having a lot of different things makes for better program
 
and better interpersonal relations.
 
Where the cognate idea is exciting is where you have two foreign groups
 
doing the same sort of thing (
bagpipes from othmrxenaatxif
fzk two
 
countries or stick dancing from two countries etc.).
 
®azkhgzntkexzkand'*zxmgzxzx  Overall unless we can stick to the
 
tightast conceivable type of cognate (
people from the same village)
 
Jefferey feels the field worker should build up the most impressive
 
program possible and that that makes everybody participating feel good.

Jeff's favorite program.  We were awfully lucky, because we had little control
 -  
over what came from India.
 The reason it succeeded i
s that Miss Bhagat
 
was Indira Ghandi's social secretary,zagdzshxz:ke19z f
or many years and she took
 
a personal interest.
 They took our guide lines through Nazir seriously and
 >
`
  
both Miss Bhagat and Miss Prakash seailyzkadzko (
crafts coordinator) really
 
had to fight to bring real f
olk artists or eazxzxaxaxs people who were carrying on
 
f
olk traditions (
rather than classical tradition*x which was backed by higher
 
ups in the cultural ministry who were unconvinced that f
olk traditions should
 
be presented abroad.
 
She succeeded because she is intelligent, in a good high position and is aggressive
 
She interacted well with the performers, presented very well, joined in with
 
the bhajan singing.
 The Indian Americads got along very well with her and
 
respected her.
 Actually everybody got along well with everybody except for
 
ixx Nazir who was dogtired and a bit irritable that week, resulting in his
 
being much less effective than he was during the Pakistani week.  He had trouble
 
dealing with Miss P
. the first couple of days; basically, both Susan and
 
Jeff thinks this was because he was very tired.  However, once again, he did
 
an excellent job of presenting, and once Miss P
. saw how difficult i
t was to
 
control things on the mall, she relinquished scheduling to Nazir and this worked
 
much better.
 
Amy  Catlin has a marvellous way about her, charmed everybody including the
 
sub-group leaders and Miss Bhagat; just being there, she helped out enormously.
 
She presented xzkitttiex only a little but what she did she did nicely and
 
presented quite well on tour.
 She and the other f
our ladies would get together
 
every morning on tour and discuss the day's schedule, and they had really a
 
very smooth tour.
 She said it was like four sisters gettin gtogether.
 
She worked extremely well with Nazir and filled in quite nicely Xkax the things
 
he was having trouble with, tended to calm him down. Her field is south classical
 
Indian tradition, and that gave her a bit of difficulty because most of the
 
material was from the north.
 Both she and Nazir worked hard all week taking
 
notes and typing them up so that she would have a good disxax8ikx  lot of material
 
for informative comment on tour.
 She came highly recommended by Bonnie Wade
 
and seems to be an impressive young woman.  Had a wonderful interviewing technique.
 
She herself is a musician and performer and the musicians respected her and talked
 
about musiciaxx with her.
 
The governments published two pamphlets, one of music, one on crafts.  Same
 
thing with Rumanians and Switzerland -- governments arriving with material we
 
have not had a chance t
o review.  Mostly it was quite good but it did seemed as
 
though they were advertising their side of the show.

Nazir not as good in the activity center the Indaia week; probably fatigue
 
since he doesn't wear well.
 
Some of the material was not strictly folk--the girl dancers, e
.g.,; however
 
the material was excellent as a whole, showed both real f
olk and students of
 
folk, in this way it was dynamic then a good marriage between the two, what'
 
the public would like, the f
olklorists, everybody was pleased.
 
Audience reaction VERY positive, to the crafts as well. Excellent craft material
 
but could have used presenting; often much lilence, with only the craftsment
 
working. Some volunteers were conscripted to say a few things about the crafts.
 
The platform style of exhibit worked very well; nice to have them all under one
 
tent. Shirley suggests that someone be hired to be simply a crafts coordinator
 
to see that the exhibit was set up properly each week--India an example of what
 
could bedone.  Some silea going on sub rosa until Shiley put a stop to it.
 
Food demo was excellent; lots of different preparers. 61les- Sales were OK but
 
not up t
o expectation. Exotic names in foreign languages for the foods need to
 
be traslated on the menu. Many didn't know what i
t was that they were eating or
 
ordering. Just a plateful of sample isn't sufficient. Jeff questions whether
 
craft sales are worth it. They don't make much $
, people go away with a surplus.
 
Good f
or the American public not to be able to buy something everywhere.
 
Suggestion: could crafts be purchase abroad in advance, then sold through museum
 
shops? Or at Festival and suprlplus channelled through the museum shopes ?Susan
 
says butting crafts, i
/e/ owning something, is more important thatn learnging about
 
how it i
s made ;
 44 people take pictures of things so they don't have to really
 
look at them. J & S questions whether drafts should be sold at all.
 
Jeff not exhausted after his last country. In fact, Indian Americans were so nice
 
and helpful and everyone got along so well that it was a pleasant week. But the
 
whole summer did begin to wear . . .
 
Susan says sthere was a brief skirmish between the Austrians and the Indians at
 
the Activities center the first day. Nazir was late s
tarting, went off in a huff
 
when Fastnacht people arrived. Then Indians set up musicians outside tent and
 
drew their own crowd, etc.

Relatively few problems overall.
 Main difficulty was the west coast people
 
being too bawdy and offending Lopes Graca and Maria Ernestina.
 West coast,
 
east coast and the two Portuguese groups were very quarrelsome withim each
 
other, but that seems to be a sort of Portuguese style.
 They didn't seem
 
to get really mad.
 
Lopes Graca actually brought some of the most elegant folkloric material we
 
had all summer and thus x he was particularly sensitive to the earthy and
 
bawdy material of the desafio singers; it upset him.  Joao and Nemisio
 
made some unpleasant statements about the child desafio singers and baited
 
the Allentej singers during a workshop.  The west coast people seemed t
o
 
go on the defensive.aTsd gwtxwNzxexaszkhRzweHkxwE[ak'17his might have been due
 
to their having done such a big show t
ie summer before and they felt bad
 
that they were presented in a weaker c
ontext this summer.
 
The east coast Portuguese came in very bratty and awful, but settled down
 
worked hard and were very popular with everyone but Lopes Graca. They were
 
very enthusiastic; Larry said he would give anything t
o have such a bunch in Calif.
 
Conceptually, this was the program t
hat was t
he most difficult t
o work out
 
in advance.  Portuguese seem t
o be naturally competitive anyway and they
 
certainly behaved so on the mall.  It was c
lear there were c
ompetitive and
 
political problems within the groups, but somehow or other, i
t actually
 
worked out well.  Susan f
ound the best way to handle the whole problem of
 
Portuguese interactional difficulties was not to take it t
oo seriously
 
because actually they did function well.
 
The real difficulty was the budget cruch here -- khutxxx there were too
 
few groups (
two from Portugal) and fHwx€xem three or four American Portuguese.
 
There were also too few instrumentalists, and they worked all the time.
 
The Rancho Folklorico people benefitted enormously by participating; they
 
really liked the Portuguese I
aKapiK stuff and felt terribly good about being
 
brought together.
 Everybody loved the children and Silvana.
 Elena Olivera
 
had a very good informal way of approaching stage presentation and was perfect
 
for a festival.
 
In retrospect, Joanne Purcell would have driven us all crazy.  Most problems
 
disappeared by the end of the week, but if Joanne had been here they would
 
have advanced.
 
Jaime was very good at handling the eternal politics of the program; he was
 
a poor presenter - kxd very monotone and unenthusastic but improved by the
 
end of the week, asking the audience for questions.
 He had a real problem
 
because he felt he didn't know technical information;  his sense of authority
 
grew as he went along.
 Jaime is difficult in that he is pretty sarcastic,
 
but he is really a nice guy.
 
One thing akakx about the Portuguese -- they are very patient; they will sit
 
and wait and stay put.
 Silvana Ehrman was the cultural liason and was perfect.
 
Maria Ernestina had poise, charm, competence and`L�'�family friend of Lopes Graca
 
so she could handle him.
 She was also a good presenter in the activities center,
 
and the main stage.
 She fielded questions extremely well.

Joanne Purcell always says that Portuguese are extremely good organizers;
 
you can put them into any situation and they sort of take hold.  This
 
may be why Jeffery thinks it was one of the smoothest weeks -- he is
 
thinking in terms of dorm, travel, food, etc.  where they were patient
 
and generally easy to handle.
 Folklorically i
t's a different matter.
 
Odette was great; f
ood demonstrator.
 She interacted well with the
 
other presentations -- she sat in the audience at the stage a lot
 
and sang in and i got t
o be very close friends with all the other
 
Portuguese and Portuguese Americans.
 
In future, we must figure a way to get
 
free wine.
 It i
s simply an essential.
 
compensation from their government, so
 
to pay for wine even at just 15(,, a cup.
 
than walk into Georgetown because they
 
but wanted to take i
t home.
 
Portuguese (
and many other countries)
 
The Porguguese were not getting
 
it was really unfair to ask them
 
They sat in the dorms rather
 
didn't want to spend their money
 
It was a constant embarrassment kx not to have sightseeing free for
 
performers.
 It was every week the same story.  RxaxXxxRR We should also
 
have had something to give them besides a certificate.  Many field workers
 
went out and spent their own money t
o get presents f
or the performers.
 
The medallion idea o
va would have been excellent f
or them.
 Sightseeing
 
should have the first priority, then something to give them folks.
 
Wine, tea, beer are crucial.
 
There should have been some sort of laundry service; many of the middle
 
eastern people spent far too much time washingx down in the basement.
 
Susan_- I really object to the first two sentences of this section,
 
although the picture doesn't look as cheerful if you read on down.  My
 
impression of the Portuguese week m m is that we were always involved
 
in some sort of hassle, usually hurt fcclings, offended sensibilities,
 
gossip, nothing terifically serious but very wearing.  When we suggested
 
for example, that the Hartford group learn a dance that the West Coast
 
group did, they refused, saying they were tired.  The next day they
 
learned and performed the dance.  THe main difficulty was this sort of
 
constant nagging and the energy it took to deal with it.  Fortu nately,
 
I was liking them so much that it sort of balanced out the irritations
 
but I still remember the week as very tiring.
 
GUIDELINES FOR PRESENTATIONS, FAF
 
The -overall goal of our Festival is to present traditional
 
artists in their very best light.
 
The function of the presenter is to frame every performance
 
by these artists so that audiences unfamiliar with the culture
 
can understand and appreciate the expertise of the performer
 
and the significance of his material.
 
The ultimate goal of the presenter is to send performers
 
back home strengthened and invigorated by the experience of
 
performing before an appreciative and approving audience from
 
the larger community.
 
The responsibilities of the presenter are:
 first, to the
 
well-being of the performers; second, to the scholarly concerns
 
and values of the Smithsonian; and thirdly, to the refreshment
 
and stimulation of the audiences.
 Most of the time, these three
 
goals are one.
 
The following are some specific ways to fulfill the above
 
strictures.
 
1
.
 No performance on a stage or workshop should-take place
 
without a presenter in full-time attendance.
 The overall
 
responsbility for an effective program is yours.
 
2
.
 Try to become familiar as quickly as possible with your
 
performers'  repertoire.
 List it and carry the list with you.
 
Performers often forget their most interesting material and
 
may "dry up" on stage.
 
3
.
 Plan your program at least briefly with the performers
 
involved ahead of time.
 No performer should get up on
 
stage without at least some idea of what he is to do and for
 
how long.
 
4
.
 Do not be afraid to tell your performers quickly and directly
 
if any of their repertoire is unsuitable for performance on the
 
Mall.
 They do not want to be embarrassed by a cool reception.
 
Watch particularly for songs containing ethnic or racial slurs.
 
5
.
 All programs presented on the Mall must include some
 
informational content.
 This can include remarks about the
 
performer's region, the group he represents, his individual
 
history, the type of performance, stylistic points to be noted,
 
etc., etc.
 The performer's registry will include some suggestions
 
that may be useful.
 Such remarks should be brief but should
 
address the educational function of the Smithsonian.

.
 E
'  
guidelines, cont.
 
page 2
 
6
.
 Do not feel, however, that you need do all the introductory
 
speaking yourself.
 Some of your performers may be eloquent
 
speakers, and even those who know only a few words of English
 
may want to use them.
 
7
.
 Plan to include the audience in on the action as much as
 
possible.
 If there are not songs that the audience can join
 
in singing, teach them the appropriate way of demonstrating
 
approval in the particular culture or a few words of apprecia-
tion in the particular language.
 Children's songs are often
 
very easy to teach; ask your performers if there are any
 
counting songs in their language which they can teach.
 
8
.
 Though there is no need to be solemn, your role is not
  
that of an entertainer.
 Your role is not to amuse but to
 
back up the performer and not risk overwhelming him.
 
9
.
 When you are presenting a performer, especially when you
 
are on stage, give that performance your 100% attention.
 Your
 
behavior cues the audience.
 
10.
 It is very easy to fall in love with one particular per-
former or performance group.
 This is fine for the beloved but
 
extremely demoralizing to the rest of the performers.
 Please
 
try to avoid any appearance of favoritism in personal attention
 
or in scheduling.
 All performers should, if possible, appear
 
at least once on the main Festival stage.
 
11.
 A final thought:
 in pre-rehearsals and as the Festival goes
 
along, help your performers dig for their best repertoire.
 Ask
 
them about the oldest songs they know, the story songs; help
 
them become aware of their own categorization system so that
 
they can take over their own program planning.
 
12.
 Come well rested, with your homework already done, and
 
be prepared to stay in focus.
 This is an extraordinarily in-
tense experience and you will need to call upon all your energies.

Yank Rachell-blues mandolin (
Barbara)  needed better presentation and more
 
working with ahead of t
ime.  As a rule of thumb, Barb thinks you can r
isk
 
getting i
nvolved with e
lectric bands only if you do a l
ot of work before-
hand talking about goals of festival etc. because you're working with people
 
who are earning their l
iving by their music and resist changing to suit
 
festival pattern.  This can't be done by phone.
 
(
Beverly agrees and adds that education about f
estival goals should be done
 
during f
ieldwork.)
 
(
Bill thinks the presentation was okay but the office staff was not very
 
tactful in the way i
t went about informing Rachell that they would prefer
 
he didn't use an e
lectrified mandolin.)

Jennings Family (

Jim even says they arc a bit difficult to deal with.  Three of t

two backups included and they play with a f

larence Langen, New
 
Brunswick style.  Limited song repertoire of sentimental songs (
close
 
harmony) and good mandolinists.
 
(
Beverly apparently agrees)
 
(
Bill "
I agree with the evaluation of their musical abilities but not
 
with the comments about their social personality.  To set the record
 
straight it should be noted that Jim said they were difficult because
 
of their religious beliefs, nothing e
lse.  They don't play f
or dancing
 
and they don't drink and these two things make them different from most
 
participants.  On the other hand they do not force their beliefs on
 
anyone and are pleasant, cooperative people who always try to do their
 
best in a performance.  They will however react strongly to an ego
 
centered, domineering personality (
as would anyone) who i
s more c
oncerned
 
with having their way than paying attention t
o the problem under con-
sideration.")
 
Bill Neely, Larry Kirbo (

Further possibilities for Haitian crafts/arts
 
1
 
1)  Since James Early has recommended
. bringing Andro DimanchE
 who
 
is unquestionally the finest sculptor in Haiti, it occurred to me that
 
two other aspects of Haitian art might be represented as well:  nameoly
 
metal carving and painting.
 
2)  Georges Liautaud,  who is really the first to have begun the style,
 
is a fine metal carver - flat pieces of# oil drums were used at first
 
then pierced out or
 ith tin snips cut  into various fantattic shapes
 
related to vodun or Haitian folk beliefs.  He lives  in Croix des Bouquets,
 
and  is about 70 years old.  Don't know whether he'd come; if not,  a second
 
choice might be Muffat Brierre.  I think it significant that a metal art
 
tradition is emerging in Haiti,  as this is one of the few things which
 
did not take root  in -
Haiti from all the African traditions transplanted
 
there.  It  is really quite unique,
,  and the pieces are bringing high prices
 
in the art world these days.  I have photos somewhere or could get them.
 
3)  Haitian folk painting
 although it has degenerated somewhat for the
 
tourist trade s is still viable  in several artists.  By far the greatest
 
is Andr6 Pierre  (Croix des Missions),  himself a houngan and active  in
 
vodun
 in his own hounfor 
Pierre,  when  I was in Haiti,  was visited by
 
no less a person than Andrdr Malraux,  who pronounced him and St.  Brice
 
as the only real artists practicing today in Haiti,  I have spent many
 
hours in Pierre's smalle caille watching him paint the fantasticly
 
brilliant scenes from his own V spiritual experiences inthe religion.
 
All of his paintings are of ceremonials and he enjoys talking about
 
what everything represents as he paints.  I think,  with an  interpreter,
 
he could do a fine  job of explaining some of vodun beliefs through his
 
paintings,  certainly would be a good antidote to whatever theatrical
 
dancing we might get.  Incidentally
 Pierre  is of the people,  and supports
 
a family of 27 daily
 choosing to live  in the country in spite of the
 
prices  ($1000 and up)  his paintings are now bringing on the market.  I
 
am certain he would come to the Festival  if asked.  Also,  I think with
 
all of these artists
 there would be no security problem,  They are all
 
older people with families left bekind to support,  one reason  I think
 
the government there has no objection to Dimanche.

 USTIFICATION OF CONCESS LONAI M
IS
 
The African Diaspora Program is a presentation of Black American
 
culture.
 This presentation is made stressing cultural links with
 
Black communities in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa.
 The
 
culinary arts represent one of the strongest areas of exploring
 
the family of  culture in Black communities.
 
In the African Diaspora area, food is used in three ways:
 
1.
 Cooked Food Samples: 
Demonstration cooks from the three geo-
graphical areas prepare dishes utilizing pot of stew each day.
 
It is given to festival visitors as samples  (
approximately 50
 
per pot).
 
2.
 Cooked Foods For Sales: 
The Florida Avenue Grill sells to a
 
much larger festival public dishes unique to Black American
 
cuisine.  The menu also features a different African and
 
Caribbean dish each week.
 (
Ex:
 Jamaica - meat, pies; Trinidad
 
and Tobago - Callabor; Ghana - light soup; West Africa - Jollof
 
rice).  Listed among the Black American dishes are:
 Black-
eyed peas and rice, chitterlings, collard greens, chicken and
 
dumplings, peach and apple cobbler.
 
3.
 Uncooked Natural Foods For Sale: 
These foods,  fruits and nuts
 
grow naturally in many areas featured in African Diaspora:
 
The Arabbers carry a tradition of street vending in the selling
 
of their fruit, watermelon, cantaloupe, lemons, oranges, etc.
 
L. L. Greene Company features dried fruit and nut mixtures pre-
packaged.  Although they are presently identified with the health
 
food movement in the USA, these foods traditionally have formed
 
an important part of the diets of the geographical communities
 
from which they originated.
 
All of these foods - demonstration samples and concessions; cooked and
 
natural are of the African Diaspora concept and essential to the success-
ful implementation of its program.
 They function in the African Diaspora
 
area in creating the smells and tastes essential to our symbolic statement
 
of Black community.

 Haitian report  (attached)
 
DATE : Feb 4,  1976
 
1
)  Herewith is the report you requested.  Until now,  I have never
 
received a request from Diaspora for such a report.  Ralph did
 
once casually mention something,  but there was no specific re-
quest made.
 
2)  I would continue to stress the fact that the only reason I got
 
involved to the degree  I did was through a rather complicated
 
web of friendships  (?)  and ultimately Herve Mehu's blundering
 
approach to Jolicoeur, which put me on the spot.
 
3)  My own recommendations at this point would be to continue to be
 
firm in your demands with Haiti.  If you can possibly justify it
 
in your budget,  I think it would be advisable for Bernice to have
 
two or three days in Port-au-Prince at Carneval time and the be-
ginning of Lent,  specifically to review material in its proper
  
context, so that she could have a chance to see meringue and
 
rara is it  is naturally performed,  rather than have it paraded
 
before her.  Your excuse for her coming again could be simply
 
that you are trying to see things in their natural settings in
 
order to develope your programmatic thoughts on reproducing
 
these at the Festival.  This would give Bernice a chance to see
 
all the meringue bands in action,  and perhaps several rara groups
 
so that she could specify,  if not exactly who would be coming,  at
 
least what she did and did not expect of the performers. At that
 
time she could also review the vodun material they had selected
 
to get a preview of the level of performance you can expect from
 
Beauvoir's group.

Haitian report,  as requested
 
in Nov.
 
I sent a letterAto Sheila Isham, wife of American Ambassador in Haiti,
 
informing hero and her husband of Rosie's and James's impending ar-
rival with the general request that anything they could do for them
 
would be appreciated by the office as well as myself.  After I left
 
for Haiti,  a return letter from Sheila Isham,  indicated her willingness
 
to be helpful,  but that she had not heard from James while he was
 
there.  In a phonecall I had with her in Port-au-Prince,  she s
)founded
 
rather miffed that she had not been approached.  I explained to her
 
quite carefully that all our fieldworkers had a certain protocol
 
which they were instructed to follow,  and it probably did not  include
 
going straight to the Ambassador's wife. Also,  that James had been
 
completely hemmed in by the Tourist Office and certa inly did not have
 
the sort of freedom to explore things that he may have wanted.  Sheila
 
refused to believe that bureaucracy should get in the way of things
 
etc.  She still could be of some help,  ultimately , but  I don't
 
think she should be involved unless it were absolutely necessary.
 
2)
 Sheila is on my friend Herve Mehu's committee to organize the first
 
Haitian Festival of Arts. Herve had asked about possible Smithsonian
 
involvement.  I mentioned to both Herve and Sheila that I thought
 
that much depending upon a successful Haitian participation this
 
summer at the Festival,  and that we had some problems with the sort
 
of material being offered.  It was at this point that Herve
` approached
 
Jolicoeur,  completely spontaneously,  and in my opinion very ill-adviosed
 
t
o T was right there when' it happened,  Jolicoeur ignored me,  but said
 
if I had anything to say,  I would have to make an appointment to see
 
him in his office.  This I d(Dd,  cutting my vacation short a day,  but
 
he failed to materialize.  Beaause  I had given my card to his secretary
 
she asked if I wished to see Jean-Baptiste.  I was annoyed at Jolicoeur
 
and felt that my presence at the TourOist Office at least needed some
 
explanation,  so authorized her to give my calling card to J.B. He
 
asked to see me immediately.

3)  I ste
`ressed from the start that  I was on vacation,  and not in any
 
official capacity,  but that  I was aware that  "problems" had developed
 
in our negotiating and was simply there to try to give them answers
 
to any questions they might have.  They wanted to know what I thought
 
of last summer's presentation.  I was very frank,  stressing ethno-
musicological authenticity,  complaining about levels of costuming
 
and theatrical presentations.  They said they understood this and that
 
the man responsible would not be coming this year. Pierre Blanc was
 
now completely in charge and improvements would be forthcoming.  I
 
stressed that Diaspora would have to make all final decisions,  that
 
our office stood completely behind them in what they did.
