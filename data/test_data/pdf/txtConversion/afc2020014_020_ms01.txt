Finding Roots: Asian American Farmers in Contemporary America 
Mika Shibuya 
April 11, 2021 
Interview conducted by Katelyn Reuther 
Mika Shibuya is a 
co-owner and farmer at Rock Steady Farm in Millerton, New York. 
This was a 
remote interview conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mika Shibuya joined 
the interview from Millerton, New York, and Katie Reuther joined from Boston, Massachusetts. 
Interview Log 
00:00:00 
Introductions 
00:00:33 
Mika grew up in Japan in a 
mixed race family. Her mom is a 
white American 
from Iowa and her dad is Japanese. They would have family dinners around the 
table, and her mom would make both Japanese and American food. Mika's 
grandparents lived in a 
small city a 
few hours away, and her family would go to 
visit them. She recalls her grandmother having a 
small patch of tomatoes between 
their house and the neighbor's house. They would go out and harvest the cherry 
tomatoes, and Mika distinctly remembers the specific smell of tomato plants that 
gets all over your hands. She is very fond of that smell, because it brings her back 
to those memories. 
In her grandparents' front yard, there were deep cement tubs that you could fill 
with water. During the summer when they would visit, there would always be 
watermelon that had been bought for them to eat together. Mika and her brother 
were in charge of getting the watermelon in the water to stay cold. The water was 
ice cold, and they would be elbow-deep in it. That's a 
distinct memory Mika has 
of how they shared food with her grandparents and extended family on her 
father's side. 
Because her Japanese language skills have always been limited, there was a 
language gap with her father's side of the family. She says she was able to 
connect with her grandparents as a 
kid over food. They would order food, and it 
would be delivered to their house in a 
heated container by a 
guy on a 
scooter. 
They would unpack and feast on stacks and stacks of food. That was always a 
fun 
part of visiting their family as a 
shy, awkward kid.

00:04:46 
Mika didn't think about food as a 
way to connect with her grandparents growing 
up. She was pretty shy and introverted, so she would always be a 
little socially 
anxious. As she got older, she felt more and more self-conscious, but as a 
kid, that 
was always a 
fun thing they did together. 
00:05:29 
All of her life, Mika has loved eating. One of her teachers would always joke that 
every time she saw Mika, she was eating. Mika has always been a 
big eater, and 
the friends she gets along with the most like to eat. They bond with each other by 
going downtown and finding good, cheap places to eat. She didn't really have a 
relationship with farming growing up, because she was in an urban environment. 
They never had space to grow anything. That's also not something either of her 
parents had in their lives in a 
way that they would want to pass it on to her. 
Mika always liked nature and the idea of having a 
green thumb. She remembers 
going on a 
school field trip to a 
farm where she dug up potatoes with the farmer. It 
was magical. She brought the potatoes home for dinner and was excited about the 
fact that she had harvested them herself. It's a 
very simple, basic experience, but 
she loved it. 
00:07:29 
Mika had that experience harvesting potatoes around second grade. 
00:07:51 
It wasn't until she was in college that she thought about farming. She used to go 
on day trips with her parents, and they would drive by farms. As an academically 
stressed high schooler, Mika thought the farm fields looked very relaxing. She 
says in reality, farming is very stressful. 
Mika decided to study environmental studies in college, and she took a 
course 
called Food, Agriculture, and Development about the global food system and its 
issues. For one or two summers, she also WWOOFed (World Wide Opportunities 
on Organic Farms). It's an online database that connects people who want to work 
on farms with farm hosts. They typically exchange labor for room and board. It's 
hit or miss. Depending on what the set-up is, it can be kind of exploitative. That's 
how Mika got into farming. After graduating, she got her first job on a 
farm. 
00:10:13 
Both WWOOFing experiences were in the U.S. One was in New Jersey, and one 
was near Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. In Ithaca, Mika had a 
summer 
job on a 
small vegetable operation started by a 
young couple. She did a 
lot of 
independent work there. 
The second WWOOFing experience she had was a 
little bit longer. It was the 
retirement project of an eccentric older woman that founded the Waldorf School 
across from the farm. Mika had a 
lot of independence there to learn. She was in 
charge of both milking the cow and of the cheese operation. She says it was cool 
Mika Shibuya Interview Log, April 11, 2021

to have the opportunity to be in charge of something and teach herself how to do 
it. It felt very low-pressure, because it wasn't a 
production farm where there was 
an emphasis or need to make a 
profit. 
00:12:14 
Mika doesn't really remember how she chose those particular places to go 
WWOOFing, but says the locations were good. She was looking for farms near 
where she was, and those opportunities seemed appealing. 
00:13:06 
Going into those WWOOFing experiences, Mika was interested in farming as a 
career. It felt like an easy way for her to gain experience. Like with an unpaid 
internship, she could put it on her resume and learn things, too. 
00:13:53 
When Mika took that course in college about food, she was already interested in 
environmental studies, environmental justice, and social justice. Learning about 
the food system opened up farming as a 
way to bring those interests together. A 
lot of the things she was exposed to in that class through an academic lens, she 
has now experienced first-hand. Having been farming for a 
while, Mika now has a 
different perspective. Looking back on it, the things that come up for her now 
weren't at the top of her head in the class. It's hard to know how much she's 
imposing retrospectively, but some of the biggest issues were: the prevalence of 
farmer suicide; the debt cycle farmers fall into; and the way conventional farming 
has been exported globally at the expense of local people and local farmers. 
That's something Mika thinks about a 
lot. As farmers, they all inherit that baggage 
and she wants to farm in a 
way that supports the health of farmers and farm 
workers. Food is an essential human need, but the people who grow food and 
work in other areas of the food service industry are severely undervalued, 
exploited, and expected to sacrifice their health. It's an illness of society that the 
people who grow food are doing so at the expense of their own health. 
00:17:48 
What made Mika want to start farming and why she wants to continue farming are 
different questions. She thinks back to the interview she had for her current job. 
Mika had an intense experience at the first for-profit production farm she worked 
at. That brought up a 
lot of questions for her around the sustainability of farm 
work; the bootstraps culture of overwork that exists on a 
lot of small farms; the 
way debt plays into that; and the way that can create toxic power dynamics. In 
many people's experiences, a 
lot of the harms of the conventional food system are 
reproduced on small farms. 
Mika was telling that story in the interview as an explanation for why she wants 
to work at her current job at a 
queer cooperative farm. She remembers D, the 
person interviewing her, asked why, given all of those reasons farming is really 
Mika Shibuya Interview Log, April 11, 2021 
3 
difficult, she would want to keep farming. She appreciates that they asked that 
question, because she learned what her answer was by giving it. 
All of the experiences she had at that farm, which were very specific to certain 
things that happened on that farm, are also exacerbated by systemic things. The 
things that have been painful for Mika in her experience farming are also the 
reason to keep doing it. That's the repair. To Mika, farming is repair work. We 
need to repair our relationship with the land and the ways that we relate to the 
land and to labor in a 
very extractive way. Those are the ways to stay in it, 
because that illuminates the real work that needs to be done. 
For Mika, the real work of farming isn't just growing food and feeding people, 
but having healthy relationships with her employers and co-workers and having 
them all be aware of not overworking themselves in service of farming in a 
capitalist food system. A 
lot of that also applies to work places that aren't farms. 
There are a 
lot of toxic work places out there in all industries, and a 
lot of it is 
really normalized. There's an expectation that this is what it is to be part of the 
labor force. Mika is trying to challenge that. She thinks those things tend to be 
more obvious in work that is very physical, or where burnout is mental, 
emotional, and also physical. The closer you work to raw resources, the more 
those things become apparent. However, it's relevant to anyone who has an 
employer. 
00:23:17 
Mika talks about her food and farming journey after college. The food course in 
college sparked her interest in farming, which led her to those two WWOOFing 
experiences. The second was immediately after graduating, and she was there for 
seven months. After that, she worked briefly as a 
cook at a 
farm and wilderness 
summer camp. From there, she got her first paid farming gig at the non-profit 
Veggielution Community Farm in San Jose, California. 
Veggielution is a 
teaching farm, so they had programs, internships, and workshops 
that covered different aspects of farming. Mika worked there for three years 
managing their greenhouses. That's where she got her footing as a 
farmer. 
Working on a 
non-profit farm is a 
different experience than production farming. It 
was stressful at Veggielution, because the non-profit industrial complex also tends 
to overwork its employees in different ways. However, there was not the financial 
stress that she experienced at her first for-profit production farm. 
Mika Shibuya Interview Log, April 11, 2021

After Veggielution, Mika started her first job on a 
production farm. The 
farmer took on a 
lot of debt up front to build infrastructure and set himself 
up for success, but that meant from the beginning, he owed a 
lot of money. 
Once Mika came on, it felt like there was an expansion mentality. To pay back 
those loans, the way to make the most money was to grow and sell as much 
food as possible to survive the week. Mika feels that the expansion happened 
before the capacity building. As a 
result, the farm owner was overworked, and 
they would typically work at least twelve hours a 
day. On big harvest days, 
they would work fourteen hours or more, from sunrise to sunset and often a 
few hours past sunset packing. 
Early on, Mika felt very committed to the farm. She was all in, and in a 
way, 
she became addicted to the hustle of it. At the same time, she could see how 
this was going to lead to burnout for the farm owner. She was concerned about 
it as part of that work place's culture, and she wanted to bring it up as a 
point 
of concern. It's a 
hard thing to bring up and challenge, because there's a 
mentality that that's how it is and how it has to be. In some ways, there's truth 
to that. When you're a 
small farm competing with industrialized farms who 
are exploiting their farm workers in really intense ways, people expect cheap 
food. Food access is a 
really important thing, but so is farm owners making a 
profit and having financial stability and farm workers making a 
living wage 
and working reasonable hours. That's a 
conversation Mika wanted and tried to 
have, but it wasn't successful. 
In response to the culture of that farm, Mika specifically wanted to come to a 
cooperative farm, a 
queer farm, and a 
farm that is run by women, non-binary 
people, and people of color. At the first production farm, it wasn't expected or 
welcomed to be talking about how systemic issues are impacting their 
experiences and the power dynamics in their work place. They were working 
within the system and trying to survive, but there was no room to question 
that or think about how to try and remake it in a 
more humane way. 
At the farm Mika is on now, although they're a 
cooperative farm, they're still 
working within the larger system. They still have the same challenges, and 
Mika knew that coming in. However, in order to be able to see herself 
continuing to farm into the future, she wanted and needed a 
work place that 
not only allowed those conversations but welcomed, expected, and centered 
them as much as the work they do growing food.

00:34:34 
Mika says her transition from the non-profit Veggielution to her first for-profit 
production farm was less intentional than her transition from the first 
production farm to her current farm. When she went into farming at 
Veggielution, Mika was trying to gain experience and liked that part of the 
farm's mission was food access and food justice. She didn't necessarily go 
there because she wanted to work at a 
non-profit. 
Mika decided she wanted to make the transition to production farming, and 
despite it being pretty rocky, she's glad she did it. Non-profit farms and for-
profit farms face different challenges, and even though her experience at the 
first production farm wasn't a 
positive one, it was very educational. She thinks 
non-profits can do a 
lot to challenge the food system, but if we're going to 
make real, lasting change, we need to change the food system in a 
way that 
actually makes farming as a 
business truly sustainable (environmentally, 
socially, mentally, and emotionally). That's not necessarily what she was 
thinking when she took the position at that production farm, but that's what 
came out of it. 
00:37:20 
Mika didn't have a 
community at the for-profit production farm in the same 
way she does at her current farm. That farm wasn't premised in the same way 
on shared values and shared politics as this one is. She was friends with her 
co-workers and was fond of both of her bosses. She really cared about them as 
people and when things hit the fan, she continued to care about them, but she 
couldn't support their actions. Once everything hit the fan in the way that it 
did, there was a 
lot of internal conflict. Depending on where each employee 
was on the hierarchy, they were having different experiences and views of 
what was happening. 
Mika says race plays into that, too. She had two co-workers who were also 
people of color, and they worked with her through a 
lot of the more dramatic 
changes and power shifts that occurred. They shared more of Mika's 
experience of that farm and her politics, and they were able to talk about their 
views on what was happening. She generally found more solidarity with them 
than her white co-workers. 
Mika and one of her co-workers both did farmers markets in the city on 
Sundays. They would drive up together, she would be dropped off at her 
farmers market, and then he would go on to his farmers market. On the one 
and a 
half to two hour drive to and from the farmers markets, they would talk 
about work and about the things happening there. On a 
weekly basis, they 
were able to have intense, honest conversations about the experience of 
working there. 
Mika Shibuya Interview Log, April 11, 2021

Those are formative conversations, because Mika's co-worker talked a 
lot 
about cooperative farming and planted that idea in her head. As things were 
getting more challenging, it was part of her survival strategy to read, listen to, 
and pursue evidence of people doing things differently. With Abe and Hector, 
the other people of color on that farm, Mika could have those conversations 
and try to think outside of the food system as we know it. She credits where 
she is now today to those conversations with those people. 
00:43:38 
Mika talks about how her identity as an Asian American impacted her 
experiences on that farm. She doesn't think it's because she's Asian American 
per se, but she experienced being perceived as threatening when trying to 
make constructive critiques of things she saw happening. Those conversations 
were inherently risky to her because of the power dynamics. If she was a 
white person making those same criticisms, she probably would have been 
received in a 
similar way. Regardless of the specific racial dynamics of 
whoever is in that conversation, that's still a 
messed up work place culture. 
That being said, that's also an experience of a 
lot of marginalized people 
trying to navigate and call out the ways in which they're experiencing 
oppression. As farm workers, Mika knows that they were all experiencing 
oppression in that work place. As it got increasingly worse, the farm owners 
were also experiencing oppression in the food system as small farmers. It 
wasn't accidental that the people of color sniffed out the messed up power 
dynamics sooner. 
Mika tried to have conversations with a 
white co-worker about some of her 
concerns. He was often on the side of the farm owners and the managers. As 
things got worse and there was more division, he was more easily 
manipulated. His privilege as a 
white man worked against him, because he 
wasn't aware of how he was being oppressed and manipulated. In some ways, 
he was genuinely ignorant and cared about the farm and farm owners, but 
that's also not a 
pass. He shut Mika down when she tried to make critiques, 
and by not having the same awareness or being open to conversations about 
that, he was then protecting and perpetuating the oppressive power dynamics 
that were being set up by the farm owners. That's one way their experiences 
were very different, and race plays into that. 
Mika Shibuya Interview Log, April 11, 2021

A 
lot of white men own and run farms, and they have a 
lot of people of color 
working for them who generally don't get a 
say in how the farm is operated. 
The farm owners are making money (or not) on the backs of their employees 
who are people of color. White people are responsible for being part of 
changing the food system, but they aren't and shouldn't be the leaders of that 
change. For the kind of change that Mika wants and needs to see in the food 
system, it can't be led by white men. In order to have people of color want to 
opt in to farming, it has to be different. 
If the history of farming in the Untied States is white people exploiting people 
of color, then what's the appeal for people of color to start farming? There 
need to be more farms that are owned and run by people of color who are 
committed to doing justice work and reforming the food system. Being a 
person of color doesn't automatically mean that you're going to be a 
just 
employer. All of those things need to be happening at once. 
00:52:38 
At Veggielution, Mika was working with a 
lot of white people, but they had 
similar values and shared politics to some extent. There also wasn't the 
production pressure that creates power dynamics, which in turn brings the 
ways they have different experiences to light. It wasn't really until Mika was 
at the production farm that she was experiencing these things first-hand, and it 
felt like it was really in her face. 
00:54:26 
In her current situation, they are very much a 
mixed race farm. For Mika, that 
means they value, centralize, and invite conversations and self investigations 
about how these things show up on their farm and in their relationships with 
each other. That's part of the work they all do together. In order for Mika to 
feel safe as an Asian American farmer who has the values and experiences she 
has, it's important to have a 
work place culture where that's something they 
talk about. Also, when she or others do have concerns or critiques, she can 
trust them as a 
community to hold that and not immediately shut the 
conversation down. 
Having had the experiences she's had, it's important for Mika to be 
somewhere she is thanked and celebrated for expressing her concerns, not shut 
down and perceived as a 
threat. Instead, she wants it to be perceived as a 
gift 
she's giving and as emotional labor she's doing to improve that work place 
and benefit others. It's important that they're making space in the work day 
for that emotional labor and that they're paying her for it. As a 
person of color, 
these are all important things for Mika to feel that it's a 
safe, welcoming place 
she wants to return to year after year and can invite new employees to with 
integrity.

00:58:33 
Mika talks about what it's like to work on a 
cooperative farm and how it has 
influenced how she thinks about her work. Although it's a 
cooperative farm, 
she says in a 
lot of ways, that's more true in spirit than in reality. The only two 
members of the cooperative are also the founders of the business. In some 
ways, the rest of them are employees in a 
way that's similar to a 
more 
conventional work place. That being said, because they have the aspirations to 
be more truly cooperative as a 
structure, there is also the possibility for the 
rest of them to become worker-owners. Several people, including Mika, have 
been coming back year after year, so they are beginning that process this year. 
Hopefully, this will be the first cohort to make that transition. 
In Mika's day-to-day experience, there's a 
lot of transparency around how 
decisions are made. The employees are consulted about a 
lot of things that 
they wouldn't necessarily be consulted about elsewhere. Of course, being 
consulted and having their ideas acted on are different things. It's imperfect, 
which is why it's important for them to be making that transition to hold 
themselves and each other accountable for the changes they want to make. 
Although it's not quite functioning as a 
cooperative, there's a 
culture there of a 
cooperative. It feels good that Maggie and D, the owners and operators of the 
farm, do sincerely welcome those conversations. Mika knows that the extent 
to which they're good employers is also because their employees are 
constantly pushing them to be better. They welcome that feedback, and 
they've learned a 
lot from their employees. 
Becoming members gives workers even more leverage, and it puts Mika in a 
different position. Once she's on a 
different side of a 
power dynamic, how 
does she hold herself accountable to other people that are working with them? 
She says that's hopefully work she's already been doing in her first two years 
there. 
1:04:11 
Mika would like to stay at this farm longer term. She came wanting it to be a 
place she would want to stay into the future. She had a 
really good experience 
the first year, and she loves and cares for the people she works with and for. 
Things are hard sometimes, but it feels like there's space to navigate and work 
on the hard stuff. Conflict and hard conversations are welcome. It's a 
group of 
people she wants to commit to and work with in the long term. At the end of 
last year, it felt good for Mika to say yes to making the transition to becoming 
an owner, especially because she was't the only one saying yes. It would be 
very different if it was just her. It feels cool to make that transition with three 
of her co-workers. It's a 
three-year commitment to become a 
member of the 
cooperative. 
Mika Shibuya Interview Log, April 11, 2021

1:06:44 
One of the reasons Mika decided to work for a 
cooperative farm is because 
she doesn't want to start her own farm. She never had that desire. In the past, 
she wanted to be a 
solid, valued farm worker. She wanted to find the right 
farm and commit to being a 
reliable worker there. Mika doesn't think she's 
built for the kind of stress that owning a 
farm entails, and she doesn't think 
anyone is or should be built for it. It's not healthy for it to be just one person's 
job. It incentivizes that person to exploit others. 
Mika doesn't want that kind of life. A 
cooperative farm feels a 
lot better for 
her, because she doesn't have to take that on. Hopefully as more people make 
that commitment, some of that stress becomes more evenly distributed. If they 
can all be carrying that, it's healthier emotionally for the people who are at the 
top, and the other workers can have agency within their work place. Mika's 
desire for a 
cooperative farm came from not wanting to be exploited again in 
the way that she was and wanting to work at a 
place where she can care for 
the people she's working for without it coming at her expense. 
1:10:04 
Mika talks more about how she sees and approaches her work now compared 
to when she first started farming. Now, she sees farming as a 
lot more political 
and explicitly political than she did when she started. She wants to do the 
work of farming as a 
relational and community-building endeavor and to farm 
in a 
way that facilitates healthy relationships and people meaningfully and 
deeply caring for each other and finding belonging. 
In some ways, farming is an obvious way to do those things, because 
historically, people have farmed communally. There was a 
commons, not a 
competitive, profit-driven marketplace. In that way, it makes sense to look for 
that through farming, but in another way, those values are very foreign to what 
it means to run a 
business and have a 
bottom line. That's something they all 
navigate on a 
daily basis. 
Mika sees her work as a 
farmer as repair work and healing work. She's trying 
to heal herself, her own relationship to farming, her relationship to her 
employees, our collective relationship to land, and relationships to race and 
interracial relationships. Because all of that is the history and damage we 
inherit, the work is to repair a 
lot of that. It has been a 
journey for Mika to 
realize that. She came into farming with certain values and politics, but it's 
really through the work of farming and experiences she's had that she now 
understands what it means to do that work. 
Mika Shibuya Interview Log, April 11, 2021

1:14:37 
Mika is still in the process of learning what it means to be someone with a 
mixed identity. She has baggage around that. When she was asked to do this 
interview, there was part of her that thought she wasn't Asian enough. It's 
something she's working on. 
In her farming career, Mika hasn't really been in community with other Asian 
American farmers. She has tried to pursue it a 
little bit, but not aggressively. 
At the end of her first year at Rock Steady Farm, she found a 
farm in 
California she was interested in working on for the winter. The farm, Radical 
Family Farms, is run by a 
mixed race couple, and one of the partners is an 
Asian woman (Leslie Wiser). They grow a 
lot of Asian produce and sell to an 
Asian market. Mika wanted to be part of that community. She reached out to 
them, but winter is their off season, and they weren't looking to hire anyone. 
Mika thinks it's great they take that time to rest, because farmers don't rest 
enough. Because of the pandemic, she didn't end up going back to 
California this past winter, but she would like to find a 
way to build a 
relationship with them and have seasonal work on another farm for part of the 
winter. 
It would be nice for Mika to have more of an Asian American farming 
community, because she doesn't have a 
lot of that in her life right now. 
There's a 
farm locally that is run by a 
Japanese woman Mika follows on 
Instagram, and she has thought about going to visit. Engaging with that 
community is something that feels good for Mika to lean into more going 
forward. 
1:19:45 
Mika talks about how the events of 2020 impacted her work and the ways in 
which her identity and work intersect. There's the pandemic, and then there's 
the Black Lives Matter movement, the racial justice protests, and the hate 
crimes against Asian Americans. The hate crimes against Asian Americans 
have been happening since before the pandemic, but the pandemic has 
increased them and also brought them more to the forefront. Those are all 
different things, but they're all very clearly related to each other. 
When the recent attacks in Georgia happened, Mika was in Japan with her 
parents. CNN was on in the background, and she heard basic news coverage 
of what was happening. She had a 
physical reaction, but she also wanted to 
continue on with their night as normal. She didn't really engage with it until 
she came back to the U.S. and was in quarantine. Since she didn't want to 
listen to mainstream media coverage of it, she listened to one of her preferred 
news and politics podcasts. Mika says her reaction to the reporting on what 
happened was stronger than her reaction to what had actually happened. 
Mika Shibuya Interview Log, April 11, 2021 
11 
She specifically points to the media and law enforcement officials saying it 
wasn't a 
hate crime, because the white guy who committed these acts said it 
wasn't. Mika has had conversations in her life with white men who think 
something isn't about race when it clearly is. What makes this guy who killed 
a 
bunch of people a 
reliable narrator? 
She also mentions the narrative that he had a 
bad day, and he's a 
sex addict. 
Are we or are we not aware of the ways Asian women are sexualized by white 
men? To Mika, that's evidence there is a 
racial element to what happened. The 
reporting is tone deaf and gaslight-y, but it's also very familiar. When Black 
people, including Black children, are killed by the police, the media then 
conducts a 
character assassination of the victim. Even though there are racial 
differences in how those stories are told, it's still true that those stories are 
racialized in ways that benefit and protect the person who committed the act 
of violence. How many times do white men have a 
bad day, and people of 
color pay for it with their lives? That's how we talk about it, and it's hard to 
shift that narrative. 
As an Asian American woman, Mika grew up in Japan at an international 
school where there were students from all over the world. When she came to 
college in the U.S., she immediately learned what it is to be a 
racialized 
person in the U.S. and how it's different than that experience in Japan. Part of 
the experience of being an Asian American woman in the U.S. is random 
white men coming up and telling Mika about how much they like Asian 
women, about their exploits with Asian women in Thailand, or that she's not 
Asian enough for them to be into her. Especially in urban environments, that's 
a 
reality of being an Asian American woman in the U.S. 
Seeing what happened in Georgia and how the narrative around it is so blind 
to her daily experiences as an Asian American is brutal, but also not 
surprising. There always need to be more ongoing conversations. Mika says 
she is culpable in that, too. She's responsible for doing the work to stay 
informed and be engaged. It won't happen unless she does it.

Mika talks about what changes she would like to see take place on a 
broader 
scale across the food system. She wants to see more cooperative farms and 
more cooperation between farms. It's one thing to have a 
farm that is a 
co-op, 
and it's another thing to have an economy that is based more on cooperatives 
and resource and knowledge sharing between farms. Mika isn't sure what that 
looks like tangibly, but one thing COVID had the potential to do was produce 
more resilient local food systems. There was a 
little bit of that at the beginning 
when it became viscerally apparent that people needed food and a 
farmer to 
grow it and began signing up for CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture).

Mika would like to see more resources allocated to small farms. She thinks 
they aren't going to or can't wait for the government to do that for them. She 
also wants to see a 
food system that's more predicated on a 
commons and 
resource sharing than competition. She mentions reading an article that hit the 
nail on the head and brought up a 
lot of things that aren't talked about enough 
in the farming community or outside of it. 
They used farmers markets as a 
case study, because farmers markets are 
infamously hard to make a 
profit off of unless you go to a 
huge market like 
Union Square in New York City. Time is spent harvesting the produce, 
transporting it to the farmers market, and setting up, only to make a 
few 
hundred dollars. The work hours needed to get to the market, staff it, and 
come back all must be compensated, too. A 
lot of farms do that and consumers 
like it, but it's not really financially sustainable. As farmers, you also have to 
pay in to be part of a 
farmers market. 
Instead of that model, what if farmers pooled their resources and had a 
permanent building that's protected from the weather and is open competitive 
hours like a 
grocery store? Mika likes the idea of thinking outside the box in 
that kind of way about how we can work together instead of competing 
against each other. It's very difficult to survive as a 
small farm when the profit 
margins are what they are. Mika is interested in people who are finding those 
kinds of solutions. 
2020 was a 
weird year for Mika. She responded to a 
lot of what was 
happening by isolating and not engaging as deeply with her work as a 
farmer 
in the ways she has in the past and the ways she has been talking about. She 
doesn't have her hand on that pulse as much right now, but she wants to put 
feelers out about how people are doing things. There's a 
project called 
Humble Hands Harvest, and it feels like they're trying to create something 
that looks more like a 
commons between farms. They were on Mika's radar 
last year, and she'd like to check out what they're doing. She also knows 
in the government's recent food bill, they were going to give money to Black 
farmers. 
There isn't a 
way for it ever to be enough to make up for the history of slavery 
and all of the other ways in which Black farmers have had their land taken 
from them and been exploited. Mika wants to see more reparations and more 
resources being directed toward BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, people of color) 
farmers specifically, and small farmers in general, to make this more 
sustainable.

We all like organic food, but how much are we thinking about who grew that 
food and their quality of life? She wants there to be more of a 
conversation 
around farmers' quality of life and for there to be mental health services for 
farmers. Farmer suicide is a 
huge issue nationally and globally. The people 
who grow the food that's required for all of us to live are literally dying trying 
to do that. It says a 
lot about the food system and, as Mika has personally 
experienced, is really detrimental to both farm workers and farm owners. It 
needs to be something we're aware of and talk more about in the mainstream. 
Part of having a 
CSA and trying to retain CSA members and keep them happy 
is education. There's a 
lot of education work that goes into the way they 
communicate with their CSA members. That's part of the work they do, and 
it's work that takes away from the work of being out in the field growing food. 
It's important to think about how they can be paid for the emotional and 
educational work they do, and how that work can be valued as much as the 
tangible stuff. It's all part of the cost of the food. 
As much as things went wrong at her first production farm job and there were 
lines of communication that were completely closed, Mika heard through a 
co-worker that the farm owner mentioned he thought farming should be a 
public good. Mika was excited to hear that they were on the same page and 
wanted to talk to the farm owner about this politically radical idea. Everything 
that's happening on the farm, including hurting his employees and hurting 
himself by hurting his employees, is a 
case study for that fact. She wishes she 
was in the room to have that conversation with him. 
Mika doesn't know what that would necessarily look like, but she thinks that's 
an intriguing idea. What if we funded farming like we funded other public 
goods? It is a 
public good. What if we valued it that way, and thus valued 
farmers and farm work in that way so it was less brutal? That conversation 
seems very far away, even for Mika. For someone who has been in this work 
and would love to see something like that happen, her imagination is very 
limited. 
1:46:24 
To other people of color who are trying to get into farming, Mika would say: 
know what you're getting into. Do your research on who you're working for. 
When you're in an interview, you're interviewing your employer. You should 
come into the interview with that attitude, and you should be asking them to 
demonstrate that they're worthy of having you on their team, that your labor is 
valuable, and that your emotional labor as a 
person of color is valuable. If you 
can't find an employer that will value it (and that is hard), you have to remind 
yourself of that every day. Find other people of color to be in community with.
