FAT OLD LADY 5112 A1
Bill Jackson Arvin, 1941
There lived a fat old lady In London she did dwell She loved her old man dearly But
another one twice as well O carry me away O carry me away.
She went to the doctor To see if she could find Some kind of medicine To run her old man
blind Say O carry me away O carry me away.
O she found the medicine She made him take it all He says, “My darling, loving wife I can't
see you at all”. carry me away O carry me away.
He says, “My darling, loving wife If I'd could see the way I'd go down to the seashore And
jump in and drown.” S O carry me away O carry me away.
She said, “My darling husband It's there you'll go astray - I'll go along beside you And
show you the way”. S O carry me away O carry me away.
They walked side by side together Till they come to the distant shore He says, “My darling,
loving wife You'll have to shove me o'er”. O carry me away O carry me away.
She stepped back a step or two To run and shove him in And he stepped back to one side
- Head foremost she went in. O carry me away O carry me away.
FAT OLD LADY
When she saw the sad mistake She began to scream and squall He said, “My darling,
loving wife I can't see you at all”. O carry me away O carry me away.

Then him bein' chicken hearted And feared that she might swim He grabbed him up a ten
foot pole And shoved her futher in. O carry me away O carry me away.
