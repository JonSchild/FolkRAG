The Program makes federal matching funds available for

and for efforts to renew folk arts within a community.
 
Mrs. Hawes has previously served with the Endowment as
 
Co-Chairman of the Jazz/Folk/Ethnic Advisory Panel of the

She took leave from her post as Professor of Anthropology
 
at California State University at Northridge to join the
 
Smithsonian staff in July 1975.
 At the Smithsonian,  she
 
planned and assisted with operations of the Institution's
 
Festival of American Folklife held this past summer in
 
celebration of the bicentennial.
 
Mrs. Hawes has taught adult and college courses in anthro-
pology and folklore subjects for 25 years,  the last 10
 
of which have been at California State University at Northridge.

 Film and video work has also been

In 1969, Mrs. Hawes received the Distinguished Professor
 
Award given by the California State College system.
 She
 
is past President of the California Folklore Society and
 
past Vice President of the American Folklore Society.
 
Mrs. Hawes comes from a family of distinguished folklorists.
 
Her father, John A. Lomax did pioneer field work in folk
 
songs,  collecting and publishing the first cowboy songs
 
ever printed,  as well as many other standard anthologies.
 
Much of his later career was
 spent at the Library of
 
Congress where he was the Honorary Curator and Consultant
 
to the Archive of American Folk Song.
 
The National Endowment for the Arts is an independent agency
 
of the Federal government which was created by Congress in
 
1965 to encourage the nation's cultural resources.
 It is
 
advised by the 26 Presidentially-appointed members of the
 
National Council on the Arts.

First reference:  Bess Lomax Hawes,  former director of
 
the National Endowment for the Arts'  Folk and Traditional
 
Arts Program.
 
During her 51 year career in American folk music and
 
folklore,  Hawes has been a songwriter,  performer,  folk music
 
teacher,  film-maker,  author,  university professor,  and
 
government administrator.
 
In 1977 she accepted a position at the National
 
Endowment for the Arts where she established and directed the
 
Folk and Traditional Arts Program from which she retired in
 
1992. During her tenure,  folk arts positions and programs
 
were established in arts councils,  historical societies,  and
 
cultural foundations in 45 states,  and the National Heritage
 
Fellowships were established.  She is widely known in the
 
field of public folklore.
 
A 1993 recipient of the National Medal of Arts from
 
President Bill Clinton,  Ms. Hawes taught in the anthropology
 
department at California State University at Northridge for
 
11 years and in 1968 received a state-wide Distinguished
 
Teaching Award.
 She taught American folk music and folk
 
guitar privately,  as well as through the University of
 
California at Los Angeles'  University Extension Service.
 
Co-author of "Step It Down," a study of African-American
 
children's music and dance,  Hawes has written articles and
 
produced films on aspects of folk dance and instrumental
 
techniques.  "Pizza,  Pizza Daddy-0," her 1968 film about
 
traditional African-American children's singing games,  was
 
selected for showing at the White House Conference on
 
Children in 1970.  In 1997 she was listed as third author of
 
"Brown Girl in the Ring" with Alan Lomax,  and J.D. Elder  a
 
study of Eastern Caribbean song games.
 
For a few years during the forties,  Hawes performed with
 
the New York City based Almanac Singers,  a fore-runner of the
 
Weavers. Later,  in California,  she sang traditional folk
 
songs at coffee house performances,  concerts and festivals
 
throughout the state.
 
Hawes,  whose brother, Alan Lomax,  and father,  John A.
 
Lomax,  were well-known folklorists,  earned her bachelor's
 
degree in sociology from Bryn Mawr College and her master's
 
in folklore from the University of California in Berkeley.  In
 
1994 the Austin,  Texas native was awarded an honorary
 
doctoral degree from Kenyon College,  Ohio;  in 1995 she
 
receioved an honorary PhD from the University of North
 
Carolina.

John A.  and Alan Lomax,  are distinguished names in the
 
history of American folklore studies.She graduated cum laude
 
from Bryn Mawr College with a B. A.  in Sociology in 1941 and
 
earned an M.A.  in Folklore from the University of California
 
in Berkeley in 1970.
 
Her professional career has been varied.She taught American
 
folk music and folk-style guitar for many years both
 
privately and through University Extension Service at UCLA;
 
she gave instruction in folklore and ethnomusicology in a
 
variety of west coast academic institutions including UCLA,
 
California State University at Los Angeles,  the Idyllwild
 
Arts Foundadtion  (
a summer campus of USC),  and Portland State
 
University.  She joined the faculty of California State
 
University at Northridge in 1961,  and was promoted to full
 
professor in 1974.In 1968 she received a Distinguished
 
Professor Award from the California State College System.
 
Her previous professional experience included three years in
 
the Music Department of the Radio Program Bureau,  Broadcast
 
Division of the Office of War Information in New York City
 
(

Endowment for the Arts where she established and directed the
 
new Folk Arts Program,  designed to encourage and promote the
 
traditional arts identified with the multicultural heritage
 
of the nation.
 
During her stewardship the Program grew from a one-person
 
office to a busy professional unit of seven full time staff
 
managing a several million dollar grant program.Among many
 
other initiatives,including the formation of an active
 
apprenticeship grant category,  the Folk Arts Program has
 
established a collaborating network of local,  regional and
 
state offices to help carry out its basic activities of
 
identifying,  supporting and presenting skilled local folk and
 
traditional artists and the cultural communities they
 
represent.  It was also during her tenure that the widely
 
celebrated National Heritage Fellowships honoring master
 
traditional artists were established.
 Mrs.  Hawes retired
 
from the Folk Arts Program in February,  1992.
 
She is co-author of a study of African-American childrens
 
music and dance,  Step It Down (New York:  Harper and Rowe,
 
1972)  and has written numerous articles and edited several
 
films on aspects of folk dance and traditi0onal instrumental
 
techniques  (
"Say,  Old Man,  Can You Play the Fiddle",  "Georgia
 
Sea Island Singers",  "Pizza Pizza,  Daddy-0",  among
 
others).She is currently enjoying a busy retirement attending
 
conferences,  making speeches,  writing,  and undertaking some
 
long deferred travel.
