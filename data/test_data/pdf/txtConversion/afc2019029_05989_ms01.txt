[00:00:00] Brief introduction; Kenneth Smith (“Kaden Sade”) describes basic personal 
background information including his date of birth, his hometown of Nashville, Tennessee and 
his current place of residence in Smyrna, Tennessee. Smith shares the story behind choosing his 
wrestling name.  
 
[00:02:44] Smith describes his own personal connection to the world of professional wrestling. 
Smith’s father introduced him to televised wrestling programs, most notably WWE SmackDown. 
Smith was particularly drawn to WWE wrestler Rey Mysterio due to his flamboyant costuming 
and relatively small stature. “Rey Mysterio was my idol.” In the early stages of his career, Smith 
was told to “tone down” his highly stylized footwork and flashy presentation.  
 
[00:04:50] Smith charts the history of his professional wrestling career. He tells a story of 
meeting Rey Mysterio at a gas station. Mysterio, who was unmasked at the time, gave Smith a 
bracelet, which he still has today. Mysterio offered Smith advice on how to become a pro 
wrestler. Smith continues to use this advice as motivation and inspiration to better his athletic 
performance. One of Smith’s goals is to have a match with Rey Mysterio before he retires.  
 
[00:08:07] Smith explains how he was able to find a point of entry into the local indie wrestling 
scene. Smith’s older cousin was an indie wrestler at a promotion near Smith’s hometown. Smith 
and his family attend a live show, and Smith’s mom was initially hesitant to let her 15 year old 
son become a wrestler at such a young age. Eventually she agreed to let her son train, and Smith 
began attending sessions at a nearby building. “I only trained legitimately for three months, and 
then I had my first match.” Smith clarifies training “legitimately” as learning the foundations of 
the sport (e.g. run the ropes, holds, how to work a match).  
 
He also briefly touches on the differences between approaches to training found in the south and 
those found in the north. Smith believes his performance style is a blend between slower, more 
methodical maneuvers and highflying acrobatics. He sustained several injuries at the beginning 
of his career as a result of his lack of training. Smith believes his physical appearance led 
promoters to believe he was ready to wrestle before he actually felt comfortable doing so.  
 
[00:13:48] Smith describes the evolution of his in-ring persona, especially as it relates to 
wrestling gear. He recently had nearly $1,000-worth of gear stolen. Smith feels like Kaden Sade 
is a natural extension of his own personality. “If you’re seeing Kaden Sade, you’re pretty much 
just seeing Kenneth.” Smith often wrestles as the “babyface” (i.e. the “good guy”), and he values 
authenticity. He mentions that modern audiences have a difficult time connecting with babyfaces 
because they feel unrelatable or robotic. “At the end of the day, I look at it like I’m doing a job.” 
Smith respects engaging with fans in spite of his gimmick.  
 
[00:17:26] Smith clarifies the differences between highly-stylized televised wrestling shows and 
independent promotions. He mentions the time constraints related to televised programs and how 
it affects the pacing of matches. Smith offers an example of wrestling for a local television 
station.

Smith also discusses whether the industry should remain a secret or whether fans appreciate a  
level of transparency. Smith advocates for protecting the business but only to a certain extent.  
 
[00:20:53] Smith explores what makes southern audiences unique. “I can feel an energy level 
with the fans kinda change as I’ve gotten older.” Audiences are more comfortable with being 
aggressive towards older wrestlers. Smith talks about racist chants and insults hurled at wrestlers 
of color. “And then here comes little kid me, and everyone changes that hatred.” Smith provides 
an example of how northern crowds react differently to overt displays of racism or homophobia. 
“I’ve been called every name in the book since I’ve gotten older.” While Smith is appreciative 
that southern audiences are willing to pay money to watch him perform, he prefers wrestling up 
north. 
 
Smith examines the whitewashing of the wrestling industry. He shares additional stories of times 
he has experienced, and been witness to, racism throughout his career. One story centers on a 
noose being used as part of a finishing move. Smith sees the “favoritism” exhibited by 
promotions.  
 
[00:29:05] Smith outlines a typical show day from start to finish. “Man, it’s kind of like a little 
ritual for me.” Smith prefers to be alone in order to mentally prepare for the night ahead. He talks 
about the importance of being in a safe headspace as a means to avoid injury, which could 
negatively affect his family. Smith explains the physical toll wrestling has taken on his body. 
“Thinking about what I’m going to do, how I’m going to do it. Execution. Just figuring out what 
the overall show is gonna be like.” He rarely eats on show days. Once the event begins, Smith 
goes on “autopilot,” which lasts until he arrives home.  
 
Smith describes his inner dialogue during a match. “When that music hits, you gotta walk out of 
that curtain.” He notes that he tries not to focus on the crowd, but he can “hear the atmosphere 
and energy.” Smith can only see his opponent and no one else.  
 
[00:34:50] Smith goes into the value of the locker room environment. Veterans offer advice on 
how to hone wrestling skills. Smith usually finds the locker room too chaotic and removes 
himself from the space until his match begins. “Once I perform, then that’s when I hang out in 
the locker room, start chattin’, you know? Lettin’ everything...get loose again.” He also warns 
against the danger of locker politics and “locker room drama.”  
 
[00:36:25] Smith speaks about how he chooses to build relationships with fans both in and out of 
the ring. “How can I talk to people without them feeling like, ‘This dude is just wanting to talk to 
me for my money.’” Smith feels like a large number of wrestlers aren’t concerned with engaging 
with fans. Smith values humility and works hard to build connections with fans at his 
merchandise table.  
 
[00:40:08] Smith addresses the necessity of building a brand around his Kaden Sade character. 
“Building a brand is very important because that’s your income.” He shares how the coronavirus 
pandemic has affected his ability to book shows. “A lot of shows just want to use you and abuse 
you.” Having an established brand can help a wrestler negotiate a higher payout. “I know my

physical talent, and I know what I can bring to your show.” Merchandise as supplemental 
income.  
 
Smith discusses how he finds a balance between his personal and professional life and how his 
family feels about his wrestling pursuits. Smith’s fiance is supportive of his dreams. “Now that 
she’s put the spotlight on me, I’ll take it and run with it for you.” Smith’s day job also affords 
him the opportunity to pursue his passions. He rejects the idea that you can’t have a family and 
also be a successful professional wrestler.  
 
[00:45:17] Smith describes the challenges of maintaining an engaging social media presence. 
Social media can be detrimental to a wrestler’s career. He checks older social media posts 
regularly to delete things that may be controversial. Posts are mainly wrestling, nutrition, and 
exercise related.  
 
[00:46:52] Smith reminisces on some of his stronger matches and those he used as learning 
opportunities. His “hottest match” was a “scramble match” at Freelance Wrestling in Chicago, 
Illinois. All of Smith’s opponents were considerably more skilled than he was. “In the south, I 
feel like a big, gigantic shark in a fishbowl.” Smith enjoys improving his techniques by wrestling 
outside his comfort zone. “I don’t really pay attention to my worst matches.” 
 
[00:50:52] Smith shares his thoughts on where he believes his wrestling career is headed. 
Earning a contract with All Elite Wrestling (AEW) feels possible to Smith. “When I watch it, 
there’s so much young talent on there that are getting opportunities.” He jokes that he has been 
doing acrobatic stunts for the last 11 years. “People want viral for some reason.” Promoters 
overlooking talent for wrestlers that are marketable. Smith talks about practical steps he can take 
to achieve his dream. He fears “the boys” are scouting for talent (i.e. instances of nepotism), 
which limits opportunities for those who have “raw ability.” 
 
[00:56:31] Smith gives advice to those interested in becoming professional wrestlers. Smith 
stresses athletic ability and finding quality trainers. Few reputable trainers in the south. “Keep 
your ears open, mouth shut.” Accept any and all job opportunities. “Invest in you so you can 
have a good future later in your life. All you gotta do is wrestle.” 
 
[01:00:28] Closing remarks. Smith lists his social media handles.
