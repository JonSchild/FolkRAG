And she is my lovely Sally.

Uncle Ned he shook the bones, 
Joe he played the pine-stick stones, 
While I 
made love to Sally. 
She has got a 
foot 
To fill out a 
boot; 
It's straight and long as a 
gum-tree root, 
Oh, such a 
foot has Sally. 
Sally, come up: etc. 
Oh, Sally has a 
lovely nose, 
And flat across her face it grows. 
It sounds like thunder when it blows, 
Oh, such a

So mind what you are at;

Oh, such a

gained my feet, 
And I 
asked him what he meant by knocking me in the 
street ; 
Sez he, I'll take you're ear off and he gave me such a 
frown, 
And I

Oh, the brute, etc. 
Next day Judge Cornwall let me go, providing that one 
thing, 
That I 
wouldn't be knocking people down when I 
came 
to town again; 
I 
told him I 
was a

So I

KY GENTLE P1011ihR DEAR. 
As sung by SHARPLEY'S Minstrels. 
TRERE was a 
place in childhood 
That I 
remember well, 
And there a 
voice of sweetest tone 
Bright fairy tales to tell; 
And gentle words with fond embrace 
Were given with joy to me, 
When I 
was in that happy place 
Upon my mother's knee. 
CHORES. 
My mother dear, my mother dear, 
My gentle, gentle mother. 
When fairy tales were ended, 
" 
Good night" she softly said, 
23 
POLLY ANN. 
And kissed and laid me down to sleep 
Within my tiny bed; 
And holy words she taught me there— 
Methinks I 
yet can see 
Her angel eyes, as close I 
knelt 
Beside my mother's knee. 
My mother dear, etc. 
In the sickness of my childhood, 
The perils of my prime, 
The sorrows of my riper years, 
The cares of every time; 
When doubt or danger weighed me down, 
She, pleading all for me, 
It was a 
fervent prayer to heav'n 
That bent my mother's knee. 
My mother dear, etc. 
Can I 
cease to remember, 
Or e'er forget to prove 
The vows of holy gratitude, 
The fulness of my love; 
And when thou art feeble, mother dear, 
Then rest thine arm on me, 
And let a 
cherished child protect 
Its aged mother's knee. 
My mother dear, etc. 
POLLY ANN. 
Song and Dance, as sung by DAVE REED.

happy darkey, oh, with this break-down dance. 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
And then she gave a 
sigh, 
When Pompey Smash, he shook his fist 
With vengeance in his eye. 
I 
kissed my hand to Polly Ann, 
The leader gave a 
call, 
Away went Pomp with Polly Ann, 
The gayest of them all. 
Strike up the fiddle, etc.. 
Soon Pomp and Poll were married, 
Pompey cleaned gentlemen's clothes, 
While Polly shouted hot corn 
Where the summer breezes blows. 
But now they have retired, 
You will see them here no more, 
For Pomp has made his fortune, 
And has gone to Baltimore, 
Strike up the fiddle, etc. 
DE HAPPY CONTRABAND. 
Song and Dance, as sung by DAVE REED. 
GOOD evening, white folks, her -
.: I 
ain, from old Virginny 
shore, 
A 
regular living specimen of a- contraband of war; 
SALLY WING. 
My mama he turned traitor, so I 
thought I'd better come 
Up where they go for Union, our good old Union strong. 
CHORUS. 
Come, boy, come, and go along with me, 
Come, boy, come, and go along with me. 
And we'll go down to Washington the sages for to see. 
Way out in Western Tennessee they do things on the sly, 
But General Grant was very smart, he only winked his 
eye; 
He fired away at Donelson, the rebels took to flight, 
And on its walls was soon run up the good old stars and 
stripes. 
Come, boy, come, etc. 
The South it had seceded, but they did quickly find, 
The Yankee boys could wipe them out when they once 
make up their mind; 
Our gallant volunteers now will make the rebels sing, 
If South Carolina then did out, she'll soon come back 
again. 
Come, boy, come, etc. 
SALLY WING. 
As sung by DAVE REED. 
K IND folks, now attention pay 
To this little song I'm gwine to sing, 
It's about a 
little girl I 
knew, 
Her name was Sally Wing. 
But she ran away with an organ man, 
The likes was never seen; 
How could she go and treat me so, 
Deceitful Sally Wing. 
• 
26 
WHEN I RETIRE FROM BUSINESS. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, if I 
ever catch that organ man, 
I, golly, how I'll make him sing, 
I'll break his head or twist his neck 
For taking Sally Wing. 
I 
read the news the other day 
That she, poor gal, had been taken in 
For taking clothes that wasn't her own', 
Unfortunate Sally Wing. 
But she would go away with an organ man, 
The likes was never seen; 
How could she go and treat me so,. 
Deceitful Sally Wing, 
Oh, if ever I 
catch, etc. 
On Blackwell's Island for six months, 
Judge Dowling thought it was the thing, 
To give her time to mend her ways, 
Unlucky Sally Wing. 
But she would go with an organ man, 
The likes was never seen; 
How could she 6ou and treat me so, 
Deceitful Sally Wing. 
Oh, if ever I 
catch, etc. 
WHEN I 
REITRE FROM BUSINESS, 
Am—" King of the Cannibal Islands." 
THOUGH human life as on it goes, 
Has like a 
stage-horse many woes, 
Some hope of pleasure still it knows, 
Which every one requires. 
Now though I've toiled and toiled again, 
And like a 
nigger worked, 'tis plain 
WHEN I RETIRE FROM BUSINESS. 
Some chances of a 
change remain, 
Whicb one can't look at with disdain; 
. 
For having saved a 
dime or two, 
Bought acres, horses not a 
few, 
I'll tell you what I 
mean to do 
Whenever I 
retires. 
CHORUS. 
Kicking care and toil away, 
Growing younger every day, 
There will be the deuce to pay 
Whenever I 
retires. 
I 
keep a 
store in the general line, 
Around the corner, number nine, 
A 
place I 
mean to cut in fine 
Whenever I 
retires. 
By giving weight and measure short, 
A 
pint and a-half instead of a 
quart, 
Three quarters when a 
pound was bought, 
(A practice father always taught); 
The cash I've netted pretty fast, 
For honesty's reward is fast, 
As I 
will shew them all at last 
Whenever I 
retires. 
Kicking care, etc. 
About some twenty miles from town, 
Where moralizing joys are known, 
I'll take my wife and family down 
Whenever I 
retires. 
And then I'll buy a 
mansion grand, 
That on a 
lofty hill shall stand, 
And splendid landscape well command, 
With fifty acres, too, of land; 
I'll keep of servants quite a 
score, 
A 
hale old porter at the door, 
28 
OR, CRUEL SATE. 
And if I 
need them, twenty more 
Whenever I 
retires. 
Kicking care, etc. 
My wife and young ones shall unite 
To dress in fashion's best delight, 
To put all others out of sight 
Whenever I 
retires. • 
Besides, 1'11 keep a 
coach or two, 
A buggy and light wagon new, 
If any noses come in view, 
Their greatest doings I'll outdo. 
As Congress-man I'll have a 
seat, 
A statesman ready-made complete, 
Th' opposing party I'll defeat 
Whenever I 
retires. 
Kicking care, etc. 
All that and many honors more 
That never mortal knew before, 
Fate has for me got yet in store 
Whenever I 
retires. 
If cheating tailors can lay claim 
To fashion, I 
shall capture fame, 
And in each money-making game. 
Then mine will be the foremost name, 
To sink the store and what I 
vend, 
To something greater I 
pretend, 
How I'll cut every poorer friend 
Whenever I 
retires. 
Kicking care, etc, 
OH, CRUEL KATE. 
Ant—" Molly Bawn." 
Ou, cruel Kate, you've kept me waiting 
Three long hours here for you ; 
LITTLE JOE. 
Sure, is that the way you're treating 
The boy that loves so warm and true 7 
Fast the pelting rain is falling, 
Enough my glowing love to cool; 
Loud upon your name I'm calling, 
Still you leave me quite a 
fool. 
Oh, cruel, etc. 
Katy, is it still you're sleeping 7 
Oh, jewel it is time to wake. 
Come, love, to sour lattice peeping, 
Some kind word to softly speak. 
Darling Kate, you'll drive me crazy, 
For you know, dear, I 
love you so. 
Just one word to make me easy, 
Sweetly speak it before I 
go. 
Oh, cruel, etc.

So try and pay attention,

And she wore a

THE MEMORY OF HAPPY DAYS. 
On, memory brings us back again 
To many a 
green and lovely spot, 
And echoes many a 
soothing strain, 
Perchance by others long forgot. 
Sonic gentle link enchains the heart, 
Some theught reflects the pleasing ray; 
And thus while meaner things depart, 
We live again the happy day. 
Oh, is there one who hath not felt 
• 
That, e'en amid a 
life of pain, 
There were no scenes where he had dwelt 
He would not wish to know again? 
Though dark adversity bath gloom'd 
The flowers that seemed in youth so gay, 
He never can forget they bloom'd 
Once—once upon some happy day. 
When first I 
met some valued friend, 
When first I 
breathed love's fervid vow, 
When first my spirit learned to blend 
With one who loves me dearly now; 
WALKING TIP BROADWAY . 
- When first I 
saw my infant smile, 
Though time speeds on his rapid way, 
These memories shall my heart beguile, 
And call back many a 
happy day. 
WALKING UP BROADWAY. 
As 
sung by DAVE REED. 
33 
I 
3IET a 
pretty girl to- day, 
So handsome, tall and fair, 
She wore a 
little jockey hat, 
And she had such pretty hair. 
Her dress was up a 
foot or more, 
And pinn'd up all around, 
I 
thought she'd been out scrubbing the floor. 
And forgot to let it down. 
CHORUS . • 
Ladies and gentlemen, come list to what I 
say 
About the crowded streets we walk going up Broadway. 
Then I 
met another girl 
So fair, and tall, and slender, 
The prettiest girl I 
ever see - 
In all the female gender. 
She wore a 
pretty white lace hat, 
With a 
little cut-off vail ; 
But, oh dear me, how shocking to see, 
The bonnet had lost its tail. 
Ladies and gentlemen, etc. 
When you're tired of walking, 
And want to take a 
ride, 
Jump into a 
railroad car 
With a 
pretty girl on each side;

LOONEY CONNOR AND JUDY ROONEY. 
Ant—" Nancy Dawson." 
Ocii ! 
Judy Rooney; neat and tight, 
'Twas she first gave my heart delight 
In bed. I 
start awake at night, 
A-thinking of her beauty. 
For oh! her eyes such conquest draws, 
That she has gained the world's applause, 
And Judy plays with hearts like straws, 
With which a 
knot but few tie. 
Resolved to speak my mind one day, 
I 
sought Miss Rooney where she lay 
Reclining on a 
truss of hay, 
Her cheeks so rosy red, sir. 
Says I, Och, Judy, give relief, 
For love, that universal thief, 
Has nearly kilt myself with grief, 
Unless with me you'll wed, sir. 
The live long night the ne'er a 
wink 
I 
get, but still of you I 
think. 
Since sorrow's dry, myself must drink, 
Then bid not Looney part you; 
For since my heart to you has flown, 
My night-cap it has useless grown ; 
So e'en take that, they're both your own, 
My night-cap and my heart, too.

PLAYING IN DE POLICY. 
With that the soul she smiled to hear 
her lovely self to me was dear, 
And Judy's smile brought hope to cheer 
The faithful heart of Looney. 
Upon the hay I 
bent my knee ; 
Your night-cap you may keep, says she, 
But th' other trifle leave with me, 
Your own dear Judy Rooney. 
So then I 
threw my cap at care, 
And no one but ourselves being there, 
I 
just made bold to kiss the fair, 
While blushes crowded on her. 
With downcast eyes she sighed a 
power, 
She owned of youths I 
was the flower, 
And Judy Rooney from that hour 
Is Mrs. Looney Connor.

PRETTY OCTOROON. 
As sung by DAVE REED. 
As I 
was walking down the street the other afternoon, 
At the crossing of the walk I 
met a 
pretty Octoroon. 
She looked at me so slyly as I 
was passing by, 
I 
never shall forget that little darling's roguish eye. 
I 
turned around to look at her, and others did the same ; 
She was so much attraction, they were not much to blame. 
She was dressed in height of fashion, high- heel boots 
and mushroom. 
I 
felt so queer, my heart went with that pretty Octoroon. 
The other night I 
met her at an ice-cream saloon, 
And I 
bad an, introduction to that pretty Octoroon. 
We chatted there quite sociably, until it got quite late ; 
She took my arm, we walked along until we reached the 
gate, 
She asked me there to call on her, of course I 
did consent, 
I 
pressed her parting lips to mine, and in the house she 
went. 
I 
never shall forget that kiss, at least not very soon; 
She kissed so sweet I 
taste it yet, that pretty Octoroon. 
This afternoon I 
called on her, a 
little while to stay, 
I 
found her pa and ma at home, I 
wished them far away. 
JOHNNY" STOLE DE TA.TER CAKE. 
Her pa said to me, Who are you, and took me by the cc at; 
Says I, Sir, I'm Reed, steward on the Brooklyn ferry-boat. 
Ile ordered me to leave the house, I 
did without delay, 
But the daughter said she'd meet me where we met the 
other day. 
So, white folks, please excuse me for leaving you so soon, 
I'm going down the street to meet my pretty Octoroon.

And at boarding-school confined, 
The other boys I'd lick like fun,

To pay, I'm loth to do it; 
I

For I'm the boy knows how to do it.

CARS ON TRACK. 
As sung by DAVE REED. 
On ! when I 
was a

At home I 
would not stay; 
I 
left my Alabama hut, 
And travelled far away. 
I 
left my lovely Sally dear, 
And now I'm on de track; 
I 
know she sits and thinks of me— 
I 
never may come back. 
CHORUS. 
Den Sally love, I'm going to go, 
Be still till I 
come back, 
Oh twist your heel and tune your toe, 
Bars cars upon de track. 
Sally was a 
charming gal, 
She looked so neat and gay ; 
She used to sing and dance to me, 
With her I 
used to play. 
Oh! when I 
think of Sally dear, 
It causes me to sigh; 
40 
BECKON I'M IN LUCK. 
She used to laugh right in my face, 
And then burst out and cry. 
Den Sally, etc. 
I 
wish that I 
was back again 
To my little hut, 
I'd live a 
life of ecstasy, 
Never to forget. 
I'd sit along with Sally dear, 
And never let her sigh; 
I'd wipe away her little tear, 
And never let her cry. 
Den Sally, etc. 
RECKON I'M IN LUCK. 
Song and Dance, as sung by DAVE HEED.

Her name was Sally Higgenbottom. 
Don't she look like a 
cherry hub 
When all her Sunday best she's got on! 
Sally wears a 
crinoline, 
With fal de rals around the bottom. 
The first time I 
saw Sally, 
By goodness, I 
was struck. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my love she keeps a 
candy store, 
Oh, dear, I 
reckon I'm in hick. 
My eye! she's sweeter than a 
lollypop; 
I'm so fond of Sally, for she's a 
little duck. 
She was so fair, I 
do declare 
My love for her I 
couldn't smother. 
I 
told her so, and then she said 
She'd introduce me to her mother. 
YOUNG ELLEN LORSINE.

But I

Oh, my love, etc. 
Her mother's got a 
mangle, 
And her biggest brother he's a

And Sally dear herself 
She's an artificial flower maker.

And for worse or better I 
will take her.

YOUNG ELLEN LORAINE. 
As sung by SEARPLEY'S Minstrels. 
W HEN I 
parted from Erin heart-broken to leave thee 
I 
dreamt not of falsehood, young Ellen Loraine, 
I 
thought tho' but woman thou would'st not decieve me, 
Ah, why art thou faithless, young Ellen Loraine; 
I 
loved thee in sorrow, I 
sought thee in danger, 
And dear was the peril and sweet was the pain, 
But now is thy look like the look of the stranger, 
Ah why art thou faithless, young Ellen Loraine. 
Oh, thou wert the vision that lighten'd my pillow, 
The star of my darkness, young Ellen Loraine; 
As the bloom to the rose, as the sun to the billow, 
Thou cam'st in my slumbers, young Ellen Loraine; 
Then think of. me yet when the false world deceives thee, 
And friends of gay fortune look cold on thy wane, 
42 
MY PIZETTY JEMIMA. 
When the sheen of thy cheek like the summer's night 
leaves thee, 
Thou'it think how I 
loved thee, young Ellen Loraine ? 
Oh, speak not to me, in those eyes I 
discover 
The wrongs thou hast done me, young Ellen Loraine ; 
Go, rest in the arms of a 
happier lover— 
Go lovely but faithless, young Ellen Loraine. 
The moments of rapture, the vow and the token, 
They thrill in my bosom and burn in my brain 
Go, false one, and laugh at the heart thou hast broken; 
Go 
lovely but faithless young Ellen Loraine. 
MY PRETTY JEMITIA.. 
As sung by Ancuy H UGHES. 
I 
ONCE knew a 
girl, and they called her Jemima, 
She lived in New Jersey, way over the hills ; 
Her eyes were as bright as the hens' that were setting, 
And her teeth were as bright as a 
porcupine's quills ! 
Her nose it was Roman, just like a 
young parrot's, 
And her cheeks were like sole-leather partly tanned. 
And as for her mouth, it looked like the tunnel 
That runs under Bergen, but much better planned. 
CHOELTS . 
My pretty Jemima, oh, cruel Jemima 
Oh, you naughty Jemima, that lives over the hills. 
Her dress it was cut in the neatest of fashion, 
It looked for all the world just like mushmellon peel. 
On top of her head she wore a 
big pumpkin, 
And ribbon attached to it clean down to her heel. 
Her hair was red to auburn, and awfully frizzled, 
Done up in a 
waterfall awfully high ; 
OH LUCY DARLING. 
43 
And as for her feet, you ought to have seen them, 
They looked like two crocodiles spread out to dry. 
My pretty Jemima, etc. 
Now, would you believe it, this cruel one left me, 
And ran off with another man richer than me 1 
His daddy one time sold clams in Canarsie, 
And now new Park Commissioner bold is he. 
Oh, you cruel Jemima, oh, you naughty Jemima, 
How could you go leave such a 
nice young lad as I 
7 
I 
feel like a 
fly that was smothered in molasses, 
And slapped on the wall to pine there and die. 
My pretty Jemima, etc. 
OH LUCY DARLING. 
Ant—" Groves of Blarney." 
OH 
Lucy darling, you are so charming, 
It's quite alarming how I 
love you, 
With fifty more, though I 
should be flirting, 
There's no diverting my heart so true. 
Where'er I 
wander on you I 
ponder, 
Still growing fonder, I 
fear I'll be 
In mind and feature, you're just the creature 
That's formed by nature to bother me. 
Not Cleopatra—though proud to please her 
Was Julius Cxsar, that bold Roman boy— 
Nor beauteous lichen, who made the Grecians 
To lose their patience at the siege of Troy, 
Nor all the fair ones in heathen story 
Deserve such glory, I'll take my oath; 
If there were two such I'd be an elf, sure, 
Beside myself, sure, and marry both.

A 
Stump Speech on the Times and Things, by J. F. Pootr, 
delivered by D AVE R EED. 
FELLER CITIZENS! and citizenesses, at do especial con-
sideration of an antedeluvian committee of de aristocracy 
of Weehawken, wid a 
conciliation of Wall Street bullers, 
miscegenators, and odor catfish from Fifth Avenue, Ceu-
tral Park, Sandy Gibson's, and de Guano Islands, I'm 
going to lecture dis evening on de circulated encyclopedia 
of greenbacks, non-intercumvention, de law, or any oder 
nuisance. 
Dar's lb

In de firstly place, second position, third claws, section 
de fifteenthly : 
Let us take a 
stupendous contamination 
of dis eventful period. 
Now I 
want to ax you all a 
sol-
emn question which am in de words of Miss Cora Ann 
Dickinson Hatch : 
What's become of all de silver species'? 
Whar am all 
de silver twenty-five-cent pieces what we used to have 1 
I 
guess dey become disgusted wid de shoddy speculators 
and went ober to Englurn. 
Dar a'n't none around, and 
dar ought to be lots oh ' em. 
Kase don't you read in all 
de papers about all de two-shillin' pieces we are gittin' 
from de rebels ? 
Of course you dues. 
I 
see dat dis 
point am too much contused for to penetrate the interior 
of your phreenologics, so I'se goin' to explain de problem 
to you. 
Don't you know dat whenever de Uncle Sam 
sojers wake up„de rebels hab to give up their QUARTERS 1 
Dar's no discount on dat. 
Now, what becomes of 'em 1 
Why, dey turn dem into contrabans, and den confiscate 
'em, and dar's no discount on dat. 
Ahem ! 
Now, den, 
to take a 
oblike view of de twenty-lebenth section ob do 
interior oh de finis, just elevate your ocular delusions, and 
rest your gaze on de battle-field of Fort Donelson. 
Our 
sojers had a 
pretty hard time ob it dar. 
Kase why 1 
dey 
had no nice fedder beds to sleep on; but jell' Davis was 
off after do fight, kase he had lost his Pillow.

discount on dat. 
Now, dar's Mr. Floyd : I'd like to know 
what's de reason dat eherybody blames him. 
What's do 
use ob blamin' him for gittin' out oh de place 'i 
dal, wasn't 
his fault, kase he'd been stealin' all his life, and when he 
couldn't steal any more guns or manuation or nutlia else, 
he kinder thought he'd steal away. 
But he didn't git 
away until he got a 
foot in his rear- battery. 
I 
guess he 
thought dat it was a 
bomb- shell. 
Dar's no discount on

Nextly, to de next place, in de eighty-six section 
ob de lobster claws, just roll your mental visionaries ober 
de odor side, and take a 
squint at EngInm, wid their no-
mix-in- to-get- walloped pole-i-see. 
Dar was de steamboat 
called de Smashville, dat burnt up de Slasher, and dar 
was also likewise de Tuskyroarer, a 
layin' low for her; 
and, I 
golly, if ever dey'd got their tusks on dat ar boat, 
dey'd got chawed up a 
little, and dar's no discount on 
(lat. 
I'll just 'splain to you why de Tusky didn't go for to 
take it : kase Massa A-blinkum writ a 
letter-de- cash- it-oh

dar, kase we got de Smashville here. 
Yes, and we got 
de Smashvilyans too, and dar's no discount on dat. Now, 
my benighted heathens, we'll just dive into de eighty-fust 
diagnostieus ob de double rule of free. 
Now, frinstance. 
suppose dat de furrin nashuns was to send a 
big fleet of 
ships ober here for to settle de hash. 
Some folks think 
dat dey could come right into de harbor and take de city 
ob New York away wid ' em. I 
golly ! I 
think they'd find 
themselves a 
little took in dat time : kase wouldn't we cut 
down all de hills on de Staten Island, and take de dirt to 
fill up de Narrows'? den their boats couldn't git in. 
Whar 
de water is, we would make land, but whar de land is, 
dey couldn't make water ; and dar's no discount on dat. 
To conclude conclusively for de conclusion, in de last 
place, my feller-inebriates, I'se a-goin' to conclude my 
speech by tenni' you a 
few facts. 
Now dat de con-jeff-

WOULD I 
WERE A FLY. 
As 
sung by DAVE REED. 
On, would I 
were a 
fly to buzz about all day, 
Oh wouldn't I 
live high without a 
cent to pay, 
And in the windows I 
could bask it in the sun, 
And lick molasses candy, 0 
wouldn't that be fun 7 
I'd never mind the taxes, no matter how they'd rise, 
For while there's stamps on every thing, there's none 
upon the flies. 
CHORUS . 
Oh, would I 
were a 
fly to buzz around all day, 
Oh, wouldn't I 
live high without a 
cent to pay. 
Oh, if I 
were a 
fly, from place to place I'd roam, 
l'd have no cent to pay, Id have no cares at home ; 
For, unlike married men, only I 
would laugh at fate, 
I'd have no wife to scold me if I 
should stay out late; 
No falsehood I 
should try, nor no excusive dodge 
By telling Mrs. Fly that I 
was at the Lodge. 
Oh, would I, etc. , 
Oh, if I 
were a 
fly, a 
buzzing I 
would keep, 
And hunt until I 
found some bummer chap asleep, 
how jolly it would be upon his nose to light, 
Or drop into his ear, and then I'd buzz and bite ;

And if away he'd drive me I 
would come back again, 
l'd bounce upon his nostril and make him squeal for pain. 
0, would I, etc. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
fly, on a 
gin glass I 
would light, 
Then I 
would sip away and never would get tight ; 
No fear to be arrested nor through the streets to reel, 
For a 
fly. can sip his toddy, ne'er a 
headache feel; 
Oh, then, how I 
would buzz with no fear of human foes, 
I'd never have a 
pimple nor a 
strawberry on my nose. 
0, would I, etc. 
NANCY FAT. 
Song and Dance, as sung by DAvn REED. 
NANCY Fat, she was a 
gal 
So fair, and tall, and slender, 
The prettiest gal I 
ever see 
In all the female gender. 
A 
lovely foot I 
know she had 
Into a 
boot to thrust, 
Her ankle small was made for use, 
To keep from it the dust. 
CHORD'S. 
Oh, Nancy Fat, what are you at, 
I 
love you as no other; 
Oh Nancy Fat, what are you at, 
With sweetness you will me smother. 
Nancy Fat she had a 
mouth, 
I 
cannot now describe it; 
It open'd like a 
safety valve 
When she wish'd to divide it; 
And well I 
know she had a 
nose, 
And every body knows it, 
The end of it just looked as if 
The brandy bottle froze it. 
Oh Nancy Fat, etc. 
Nancy Pat had, two such eyes, 
Like burnt holes in a 
blanket, 
The inspiration from her soul, 
I 
took it in and drank it ; 
She said dis darkey ann so sweet 
She loves me like molasses, 
That small machine she calls her heart 
Goes pit-pat as it passes. 
Oh Nancy Fat, etc.

TEATS WHAT'S 
THE MATTER 
As sung by DAVE REED. 
Goon evening, white folks, one and all, 
I've just come out to make a 
call, 
To dance and sing with all my might, 
And throw myself clean out of sight, 
And try and please you all to-night. 
And that's what is the matter. 
CHORUS. 
Laugh and sing all the day, 
Jump around and have your play ; 
For there's nothing like a 
holiday 
Upon the old plantation. 
In a 
little log but in old Virginia, 
Where mother lived when she came from‘Guinea, 
TA MK; TA BIKE, TA LUKE. 
She said I 
was the only son, 
And my age was twenty-one ; 
And that I 
had just begun 
To know what was the matter. 
Laugh and sing, etc. 
Now, white folks, my song is done, 
And I 
have had my little fun. 
To dance and sing is my delight, 
I 
hope I've done it up all right; 
I'll call and sing some other night, 
Oh, that's what is the matter. 
Laugh and sing, etc. 
TA BEKE, 
TA BIKE, 
TA IMRE. 
As sung by DAVE REED. 
I'LL sing you a 
song of a 
damsuel, 
Most beautious to behold, 
Whose parients were very rich; 
At least so l've been told. 
She used to dress in the gayest style, 
And she had such a 
dashing look; 
She sold peanuts on Fulton street, 
Ta beke, ta bike, ta buke. 
CHORUS. 
She sold peanuts on Fulton street, 
Ta beke, ta bike, ta buke. 
There was a 
gallus gay young man, 
George Henry was his name ; 
He fell in love with this damsuel, 
And he wasn't much to blame. 
He was a 
gallus butcher boy, 
And he had such a 
winning look, 
51 
Ile used to keep books for a 
free-lunch stand, 
Ta beke, ta bike, ta buke. 
He used to keep, etc. 
One day she told him he'd better get back, 
For she never could wed with him, 
Which staggered this poor young man's nerves, 
So he trembled in every limb. 
Then he frantically rushed to a 
beer saloon, 
Twelve glasses of lager he took; 
Then he stabbed himself with a 
second-hand. stove, 
Ta beke, ta bike, ta buke. 
Then he stabbed, etc. 
A LIMLE WISH. 
W HEN first my wife and I 
were wed 
Tan she no sugar could be sweeter ; 
I 
loved her so, I 
did, indeed, 
I 
often thonoht I 
could have eat her ; 
But now I 
wish, I 
do, egad, 
I 
wish to goodness that I 
had.

Blooms, dies and rots, 
Where the winter whirlwinds whistle 
All around the lots,

Saw in all your life ;

Voice like a

CHORES. 
Oh, oft her health in Podunk drinking 
Often I've got drunk, 
And staggared home with eyeballs winking 
To Annie of Podunk. 
As I 
sat by her a- courting, 
Calm and serene, 
With her apron she was sporting, 
Checkered neat and clean ; 
Oh, at every pleasant meeting 
happy was I, 
While my heart with love was beating, 
And the goose hung high, 
Oh, oft, etc. 
Mingled was our hash together, 
All day we sat 
A-chawing gum in winter weather, 
happy as fat ; 
Long 1 
stuck to her like teazles, 
Summer and fall, 
But she went of with the meazles, 
Ankle and all. 
Oh, oft, etc. 
MILD OLIVER CROMWELL. 
A very rare Irish Song. 
011, Blarney Castle, my daeling, you're nothing at all but 
could stone, 
With a 
small taste of ould ivy that up your side has 
grown ; 
OULD OLIVER CROMWELL. 
Och, its you that once was strong and ancient, and you 
kept all the Sassenachs down, 
And you sheltered the Lord of Clancarty who then lived 
in Dublin town. 
Bad. cess to that robber mild Cromwell, and to all his 
long batthering train, 
Who rolled over here like a 
porpoise in two or three hook-
ers from Spain, 
And because that he was a 
Frenchman he mounted a 
bat-
tering ram, 
And he loaded it up with dumb-powdher which into it's 
mouth they did cram. 
It was now the poor boys of the castle looked over the 
battlement wall, 
And they there saw that ruffian ould Cromwell a-feeding 
on powdher and ball, 
And the fellow that married his daughter with a 
great big 
grape-shot in his jaw, 
'Twas bould I-er-ton they called. him, and he was his 
brother-in-law. 
So they fired the bullet like thunder, and it flew through 
the air like a 
snake, 
And they hit the high walls of the castle, which like a 
young curlew did shake, 
While the poor Irish had nothing to fire but their bows 
and their arrows, the sowls, 
Poor tools for shooting the Sassenachs, though mighty 
(-rood for wild fowls. 
Now one of the boys in tlie. castle he took up a 
Sasso-
nach's shot. 
And he covered it up in turf ashes, and he watched it till 
it was red-hot; 
LOCAL ROOT ILOG OR DIE . 
Then be carried it up in his fingers, and he threw it over 
the wall, 
he'd have burned their tents all to tinder if on them it 
happened to fall. 
The ould castle it trembled all over as you'd seo a 
horse 
do in July, 
When just near the tail in his crupper he's teased by a 
pestering fly; 
Black Cromwell he made a 
dark signal, for in the black 
art he was deep, 
So though the eyes in the people stood open, they found 
themselves all fast asleep. 
With his jackboots he stepped on the wather and he 
marched right over the lake, 
And his soldiers they all followed afther as dry as a 
duck 
or a 
drake, 
And he gave Squire Jeffrey's the castle and the loch and 
the rock close, they say, 
Who both died there, and lived there in quiet, as his an-
cestors do to this day. 
LOCAL ROOT HOG OR DIE. 
A s 
sung by D AVE REED. 
On, I've just come to sing a 
bit, I'll try to please you all, 
You'll always find me ready with my banjo at your call ; 
jump right up and do my best, you'll never find me 
A

THE SONG MY MOTHER SINGS. 
But it aint a 
dif of bitterence to either you or I, 
Big pig, little pig, root hog or die. 
The New York dandies dress so very grand— 
Broad shirt collars, gloves upon the hand, 
Shanghai overcoats, mustaches to the eye, 
Big pig, little pig, root hog or die. 
Oh dear, etc. 
The ladies look so sweet with their paint and chalk, 
Whalebone hoops that take up all the walk ; 
You meet them in the street, you never can go by, 
Big pig, little pig, root hog or die. 
Oh dear, etc. 
The dandies walk the streets ; they wear their sisters' 
shawl, 
They feel very big, but look mighty small; 
When they see a 
tailor, they're always sure to shy, 
They never pay their little bills, root hog or die. 
Oh dear, etc. 
The New York ladies look so very gay, 
With their silk dresses, promenading all the day; 
Their bonnets on their shoulders, noses to the sky, 
They go it in the sun or shade, root hog or die. 
Oh dear, etc. 
THE SONG MY MOitir.R SINGS. 
THE good old song my mother sings, 
I 
love it more and more, 
'Tis worth a 
hundred other songs 
We ne'er have heard before; 
It brings to mind the merry days, 
The days when we were young, 
•ealics= 
ON MISS ANNIE BREAD. 
When oftimes with the same delight, 
We listened while she sung. 
When we could scarce repeat the strain, 
And yet in childish glee 
We learnt that song and lisped it forth 
Upon our mother's knee. 
I've heard and lauded many songs, 
But unto none belong 
The memories that endear to me 
My mother's good old song. 
It is not for its melodies 
I 
love that good old song, 
Nor is it for the simple rhymes 
That unto it belong; 
But 'tis because I've heard it sung 
On many a 
festive day, 
On some dear anniversary, 
When all around were gay. 
And ' tis that when from those dear lips 
I 
heard that cherisli'd strain, 
I 
know that to my mother still 
The joys of health remain ; 
Then ask me not what memories 
To such simple themes belong, 
When all I 
love endears to me 
My mother's good old song. 
ON MISS ANNIE BREAD. • 
W HILE belles their lovely graces spread, 
And fops around them flutter, 
I'll be content with Annie Bread, 
And won't have any but her.

DANCING MAD. 
Double Song and Dance. 
As sung by DAVE REED and FRED. ABBOT. 
SOME people talk and some are sad, 
But none like us- 
are dancing mad ; 
So ladies DOW all do agree, 
And pity take on Sam and me. 
As we were walking down the street, 
Mr. Snubs and wife we chanced to meet. 
Says I, now here's a 
pretty good chance 
To have a 
little moonlight dance. 
cnonus. 
Dancing mad we are you see, 
And if you will with us agree, 
And only give us but a 
chance, 
And we will show you how to dance. 
We went to a 
ball the other night, 
We came home when the moon shone bright; 
Said we, now here's a 
very good chance 
To have a 
little moonlight dance. 
We danced away with all our might, 
We danced away till broad daylight; 
The police cried get up and get, 
But, says 1, oh, no, we can't see it yet. • 
Dancing mad, etc. 
To make men happy all their life, 
All they want is a 
little wife. 
TILE -VOICES OF HOME. 
So ladies all, now do agree, 
And take pattern by Sam and me. 
Now ladies all, make no delay, 
But to the church you haste away, 
And it will make your hearts so jolly glad 
When you get like us, dancing mad. 
Dancing mad, etc. 
THE VOICES OF HOME. 
THE voices of my early borne, the humming of the bees, 
The murmuring of the pleasant stream, thb sighing of the 
trees, 
The watch-dog's bark at eventide, the song- bird's morn-
ing lay, 
Are old familiar sounds to me, and what more dear than 
they 
And ever, when I 
wander forth, with weary steps I 
roam, 
Till once again they greet mine ear, the cherished sounds 
of home. 
Iv'e heard the tuneful harp when touched by many a 
skil-
ful hand, 
But felt I 
not as when 'twas played amid our household 
band; 
The voices of the minstrel band, however sweet they be, 
They charm not like the plaintive songs my sisters sing 
to me; 
Though mirth and song perchance may lure the truant 
heart to roam, 
Oh, what recalls the wand'rer back 7 
the peaceful sounds 
of home. 
The voice of home, it hath a 
spell that never can depart, 
It is a 
calm and blessed thing that clingeth to the heart, 
IT PILILLOSERPICY. 
Like stars that o'er the desert shine to guide the pilgrim 
train, 
The voice of home seems whispering a welcome back 
again. 
Oh, soon the wanderer forgets the weary steps he'll roam, 
When memory gives him back again the cherished 9,unds 
of home. 
MY PHILLOSERPHY. 
As 
sung by DAVE REED. 
THE bells rang loud the other clay, 
The people were amazed ; 
What is the matter '1 
each one asked, 
A 
cry of fire was raised. 
At last a 
chap more smart than all,' 
When the question asked he smiled, 
And said the veto bill had passed, 
And set the niggers wild. - 
CHORUS. 
That is so what I 
tell you, 
As you can plainly see; 
Oh, nigger will be nigger, 
That's my philloserphy. 
Now since the nigger has been free, 
I've not a 
word to say ; 
I 
suppose they will all enjoy themselves, 
And make their freedom gay. 
I 
hope that Thaddeus Stevens and all his kit, 
Since this thing has been done, 
Will send the nigger across the sea 
To a 
country of their own. 
That is so, etc. 
62 CEASE YOUR CLACK AND HOLD YOUR TONGUE. 
There is one thing more I 
wish to state; 
They may try with all their might, 
But they never will succeed in 
Making the black man white. 
Truth, like murder, will surely out, 
That every one can see; 
You may whitewash a 
nigger, 
But a 
nigger he will be.

Song and Dance, as sung by DAVE REED. 
On, I 
never shall forget the happy day 
That I 
met my Angelina Minnie May; 
Her complexion it was sutty, 
You can bet she was a 
beauty, 
For she stole my heart and gizzard all away. 
This colored maid the darkeys did admire, 
When she smiled on me I 
thought I 
would expire ; 
But I 
could no longer tarry, 
For she said she wouldn't marry, 
But she stole my heart and gizzard all away. 
CHORUS.

I DREAM OF THEE? SWEET MADELINE . 
67 
In the sparkling of the silver shiny moon, 
This throbbing heart I °treed as a 
boon; 
She began to sigh and mutter, 
And she called me bread and butter; 
I 
was sailing in Professor Low's balloon, 
You ought to see her promenade the street 
With her little gaiters on her fairy feet. 
Oh, the way she wears a 
gipsey, 
it would make a 
darkey tipsey, 
I 
declare I 
think she's good enough to eat. 
This color'd maid, etc. 
Now, this color'd maid you never see no more, 
She is sleeping on the Cooney Island shore;. 
Her spirit now is gliding, 
And with the little fishes hiding, 
I'm afraid I'll have to faint upon the floor. 
Now ladies, I 
must bid you all adieu, 
But I 
hope you don't believe my story true; 
So if you'll excuse my capers, 
I 
will print it in the papers, 
And I'll have it set to music just for you. 
This color'd maid, etc.

DREAM OF THEE, Sipitzi MADELINE.

I 
DREAM of thee, sweet Madeline, 
So beautiful and bright, 
And mem'ry weaves each look of thine 
With every thought of light. 
Thou art the music of my heart, 
That haunts me- night and day ;-
That speaks thy name in every breeze, 
Though far from thee away.

COLUMBIA'S LION HEARTS.* 
CHORUS . 
I 
dream of thee, sweet Madeline,' 
So beautiful and bright, 
And memory weaves each look of thine 
With every thought of light. 
Madeline, Madeline, 
Sweet, sweet Madeline. 
I 
dream of thee, sweet Madeline, 
Through life's sad waste of years, 
Like spring's sweet breath on flowers that droop, 
Thy beaming smile appears. 
When e'er the world would cast its case, 
In visions then I 
flee; 
I 
fear no shade, for in my grief 
I 
turn again to thee. 
I 
dream of thee, etc. 
COLITIGIA'S LION HEARTS. 
As 
sung by SIIARPLEY'S Minstrels. 
AWAKE ye lion hearts of yore 
Columbia's children free, 
Reclaim the rights your fathers wore, 
The wide waves' mastery ; 
There's still a 
power thy fame would blight, 
Though oft it strove in vain, 
To quell thy might, 
To doubt thy right 
To rule upon the main. 
Then up ye lion hearts of yore, 
Unfurl your flags again„ 
For the honor offVolunbia, 
And her victories on the main! 
HOW DO YOU LIRE MY FEET 
Awake! the voices of the deep 
Call back your own again; 
No more should Yankee valor sleep, 
Or foes may rule the main; 
Leap, ye gallant hearts of old, 
And let the signal be 
The foremost blow 
From the strongest foe, 
To drive them from the sea. 
Then prove, ye lion hearts of yore, 
Ye have .not slept in vain, 
For the honor of Columbia 
And the heroes of the main. 
Then up, ye gallant hearts again, 
Still, still a 
sturdy band, 
We've iron ships upon the main 
And freemen on the land; 
And while Columbia's sons unite 
To guard our native shore, 
Will Yankees keep, 
O'er all the deep, 
The fame they won of yore. 
Then up, ye lion hearts of old, 
Unfurl your flag again, 
For the victories of Columbia 
And the heroes of the main. 
HOW DO YOU LIKE MY FEET 
As 
sung by DAVE REED. 
As I 
was walking out one day, 
In this muddy weather, 
I 
saw a 
girl with pretty feet, 
Cased in morocco leather. 
She smiled at me, I 
winked at her, 
And then 1 
crossed the street; 
70 
1101Y DO YOU LIKE MY FEET 
When turning round, she said to me, 
how do you like my feet I, 
CYMRU'S. 
Says I, bliss the rain and bless the slush, 
That makes this muddy weather, 
So I 
can see your pretty feet, 
Cased in morocco leather. 
She wore a 
handsome waterfall, 
And a 
new fashion bonnet, 
One of the latest fashion sacks, 
With shoulder straps upon it. 
Her dress she lifted out the mud, 
As she tripped o'er the street; 
I 
really thought that I 
should faint, 
She had such pretty feet. 
Says I, bless, etc. 
I 
walked apast and looked around, 
She looked at me and smiled; 
I 
slackened up my pace a 
bit, 
And spoke to, 
her quite mild. 
We were just by Taylor's big saloon, 
Says she, won't you stand treat? 
I 
could not well refuse her, for 
She had such pretty feet. 
Says I, bless, etc. 
We went in there, refreshments had, 
I 
thought that I 
had won her, 
But when we came out, says she, good-bye, 
And tripped around the corner. 
I 
went right home, and went to roost, 
But found I 
could not sleep ; 
For right before my eyes 1 
thought 
I 
saw those charming feet. 
Says I, bless, etc,
