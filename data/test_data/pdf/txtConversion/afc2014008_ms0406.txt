Subject:
 Interdisciplinary Funding
 
Apparently I was c
an vacation when the idea of each proarar's
 
contributing to an inter--disciplinary funs? in Special P
rojects
 
was discussed.
 I heard about it first at the first day's
 
budget hearings.
 
Had I .mown about it,  I would have added an additional $50,000
 
to r
ry budget submission for that specific purpose.
 Folk Arts
 
is already doing more inter-disciplinary fundine than most of
 
the other progrartsz  I had figured continuing to co-fund and
 
transfer funds to Dance, Opera/Music Theater, Media Arts and the
 
like within the presentation and documentation categories of
 
our
. 1981 budget submission.
 
What I an
. saying is that to break an amount out of our current
 
;
submission for transfer to Special Projects would really be
 
a hardship for us.
 It is a carefully wrought and absolutely
 
bar e-bones budget.
 I urge you in the strongest terms to con-
sider adding on the amount you feel we should contribute to
 
the poo l
.
 
My apologies for forgetting to bring this up at our recent
 
hearing; it simply slipped my rind.

Dear t
er. afield;
 
Unfortunately I do not have a copy of the Cultural Past
 
article at hand as I write this, bqt either the article
 
is misleadinq or you received the wrong impression of the
 
position of the Folk Arts advisory panel.
 
The problem of media support is a continuous issue in panel
.
 
deliberations.
 In the case of recordings, the panel is
 
concerned lest our funding in thf s area might interfere with
 
the normal operations of the commercial market.
 Therefore,
 
the panel re
stricts its funding recommendatiors to
 
support of previously unrecorded music or projects where
 
federal assistance is clearly appropriate.
 Funding is
 
normally confined to research costs W
 perforrance fees.
 
In the case of films, the panel's essential concern Is with
 
distribution -
-- the fact that so few people or0inaril
.y
 
see the results of our funding.
 costs are also a
 
major concern
..
 i
re have indeed 40ING unsatisfactory films;
 
we have also funded same extraordinarily firs M
rs.
 Nobody
 
is perfect.
 
As to your request for
. :
a list of the films we have supporteO,
 
I am sorry but I simply cannot give you that information
 
because of lack of stuff time to retrieve it for you.
 The
 
Endowment has only recently gained a computer facility; within
.
 
,
a year, wa aught to be able to provide anyone with such lists.
 
However as of now,  I will simply invite you, should you ever
 
be in the Washington area, to come by ane go through our records.
 
The information is entirely public, of co"rse;  it'a just not
 
physically possible for us to honor your request at this time.
 
I hope the above: information is helpful to you.
 Tbank you
 
for your interest in our proc;raw.
 
Cordially,

Dear Mr.  Durh am:
 
Your letter of May 21
. has t
i
e
:
•
=en referred to Folk Arts by the
 
Visual Arts Program.
 I under
.
 stand that they have already written
 
you,  enclosing their nxideline
:✓
~s for your information.
 
I shall enclose with this letter a copy of the Folk Arta
 
brochure explaining our particular prograr.
 It's difficult
 
for me to tell, on the basis of your letter, whether or not
 
you have a project that might qualify under our guidelines,
 
but I do have a sugqeastion or two to make.
 
Several years ago,  the Folk Arts Program funded a project
 
develope d by the southern California Luiseno tribes in which,
 
with the assistance of a professional photographer in Log
 
Angeles,  they visited a11
. the California museums and photographed
 
their holdings of Luiseno basketry for use in reservation e
'duca--
 
tional and cultural programs.
 Duri
.ne the project,  the photo-
grapher, Ms.
. 
 Susan Dyal  (
107 Rose Avenue, Venice, California —
 
213--392--1521, home ,
phone;  2
.13--396--9608 at work)  trained twelve
 
Luisenos in how to photograph objects.
 The results o` this
 
particular grant are absolutely splendid:
 an amazing collection
 
of over 350 first-class Color  s
lides of extraor0irary beauty,
 
display photoq
_
 ra-phs of all the native plants of in ortance in
 
Luiseno culture,  aniJ first--class copie s of all the historical
 
photographs in the possession of California
, museums.
 
I would strongly re
 Commmend that you get in touch with Me.  Dyal
 
and the Luiseno elders who particip
•ated in this project.
 I
 
believe you would he inspired and Jeeply proud of the results.
 
.
'he Folk Arts Program
: itself was so encouraged by the high
 
quality of this project that we are supporting an effort 'to
 
write it up in a publication to be produce d by the Native
 
American Center at U.G.L.A. , a Facility which is under the
 
direction of a Native American ethnomusicologist, F
ir. Charlotte
 
Meth  (
a member of the Folly Arts advisory panel) .  Perhaps a visit
 
to this Cente r and a talk with Dr. Heth might he o f use to you
 
also.
 
I hope the above infa "
,
 ation is useful,  ane I hope that you
 
will take a fear moments to read through the Folk Arts
 
guideliDes.
 If you have any questions an them, please write
 
again, or telephone us at 212-634-4282, person-to-person
 
collect, anc! we will return your call on the federal line.
 
Yours sincerely,

Dear Vaughn;
 
Thank you so nuch for
, your gracious letter telling me about
 
the JFolk Arts Seminar.
 I am both glad are sorry to have been
 
missed  (
sorry, of course, that I coul('n't he there myself).
 
Congratulations on the
. obvious success of your Conference
 
and on your excellent relations with the Illinois Arts Council.
 
It's great ne ws that they are publishing a r
^onocra ph on your
 
deliberations, a
sp! I
'll look forwara to receiving a copy.
 
Judy McCulloh was just in Washington for a Fold.
. Arts panel
 
meeting, and re-orted enthusiastically about the entire event--
the conference as well as "Cele:bration  "
79".
 
I put the matter of your grant time extension into Martha
 
Ruenhold's capable hands, and she assur es re that there will be
 
no problem.
 You can assume via this letter that the extension
 
has been granted; do not, however, expect a confirming
, letter
 
from our Grants Office for another tenth.
 They are currently
 
in the throes of reorganization as well as coping with the
 
oncoring end of the fiscal
. year, c
xo such easy problems as tirue
 
extensions tend to get pushed to the bottom of the pile.
 
Again, r
ay regrots at not '
paving been able to l
ie witk) you, and
 
r
ay very best wishes for the continued success of your project.

 tt is too hdd, rut we are an short

Dear Mr. Boozer
 
A phone call from Linda nuki and a pleasant chat, also by
 
phone, with my old friend, Dewey Baifa, have alerted me to
 
the fact that the Ac Kiana Arts Council will be the futnrea
 
sponsor of our Acadian Artist s-in-Schools application
 
(
#I 12472-7P) .
 
I am very plea
W with this development, not because the
 
Arts Endowment was in any wary unhappy with
, the sterling work
 
of Ann Romaine and the Southern Folk Cultural Pevival Project,
 
but because I belie=ve very strongly in the princicle of local
 
control and local :
support for local
_ arts activities.
 It s
e a
 Ts
 
to a
te that we all ogre a real debt of aratitude to Ann and the
 
SFCPP for initiating this project and carrying it through for
 
several years:  it also seems to me that, now that the project
 
is on such a sound footing, it is tine to make the change to
 
local sponsorship.
 
T Also want to make it very clear that the Fndowment has the
 
very highest retard for Dewey I V fn as a major artist a
.ne as
 
a gentleman of the hichest integrity.
 His handlinq of fina
.nci,al
 
details under the former grants has been exemplary, and I
 
believe any fiscal accounting problems that K I M need to be
 
spelled out can be handled between you two experienced gentlemen
 
with relative ease.
 
We will need an official letter from the Acadiana Arts Council
 
stating that the organization accepts fiscal responsibility
 
for administerinn the grant, and a copy of your IRS determ i-
nation letter.
 I am writing Ann Romaine today for a letter
 
reauesting transfer of the grant, and upon rer
.
.eivina these
 
documents, we will complete the transaction here.
 Dewe y Aalfa
 
will, of course, remain as Project Director.
 
Please rest assnree that the Polk Arts grogram is highly
 
sueportive of they project as it has been, and will continue
 
to he carried on.
 We are most anxious to he of any assistance
 
possible.
 Please don't hesitate to call or write if there
 
are any questions, Z can he reached at  (
202)634--4252, and
 
if you will
. call person-to--persor collect I will return

Dear Ms.  Ferman

 I eo indeed

,
 
if at one remove.
 
It seems to Me  that this project woulO  fit within the Falk
 
Art*  Program quidelines,  a cony of Which I enclose for your
.
 
interest.
 Read the little 
 brochure first;  it's more h"ranea
 
ane explains our program in  (I hope)  non legalistic terms.
 
The larger brochure contains our guidelines ane all the various
 
legal re quirements that *
gust be met.
 It also includes three
 
copies of our application blank, which should he filled out
 
in triplicate.  One of the copies should he in original
 
typescript and contain the signatures in ink so that it will
 
produce a wetter xerox copy.
 
You don't say anything about your tine constraints.
 Our next
 
Official deadline is October 1,  for projects scheduled to
 
start during the spring of 1980.
 If you really need,  for
 
climactic or other reasons to start the work before the spring,
 
we have an unofficial deadline of inly l (
for small and emergency
 
projects o
n1yY , f_ Q1l trust you to know whether or not you
 
realty need to use that particular deadline.
 Otherwise we
 
will hope to ?
year '
fror you by October 1
.
 
In addition to three copies of the filled--out form, we will
 
need a sample script ant, if
. Possible, a sample radio progran
 
as it might be broadcast.
 If the latter is unevailahle, please
 
send along some kind of taneei sample that will enable our
 
advisory panel to judge the technical competency of your local
 
W in people.
 The items mentioned in this paragraph can come
 
in after the application forms, put them in the rail to reach
 
us at least four weeks after the application deadline:
 
Personally, I think yours soune s like an extremely interestincr
 
idea, and I shall be aeliahted to do anvthi
.ng 7 can to help
 
you qet it into aood share.
 If you have problems with the
 
farms, or with working out your budget or other requirements,
 
please don't hesitate to write again or to call, r
.Frson--to-
person collect, 202-634--4282.
 Someone from the staff will
 
then return your call on the federal line.

Dear richa
 el
 
Than%s very much for your ringing support of Balkan
. Arts,
 
one of my very favorite Folk hrts granteeq,  (
just personally
 
speaskinq).  I
'll add your letter to th4-ir next application,
 
so that the Folk Arts panel can sense the kind of surnort
 
Balkan Arts venerates.
 
X think you've been a little nisinforred about our "two year
 
liriit' . Falk Arts is nothing if not flexible, and we have
 
more than once funded the same artnip for the sane thing beyond
 
two years.  On the whole, of course, our policy is to urge
 
ornar
,izations to try to i
ra3re it without Rndowment support as
 
quickly as they can, but we try to he wise arJ r
t�asonahic in
 
the actual a
pplication of this Policy.  The two year fissure is a
 
general
. male, that's a
ll.
 
As a ratter of fact, as you know, the purpose behind the e
rrant
 
to lalkan .
Ants involving your s
ervices was the hope that you
 
could help them to a higher plateau of financial stahil i
.ty.
 
2 doubt the ranel's interest will Oecreasse, especially since
 
Balkan Arts continues; to produce an exceptional quantity of the
 
highest quality work.
 
Please encourage Martin an*
, Fthel to get their application in
 
for our next panel
. neetinq.
 '
hey t
 re already late l Certainly
 
the staff will welco
ine it, and T suspect the panel will too.
 
And thanks a
crair for your letter.

Dear M
a
r
t
y
;
 
T wondered if you and Patricia would like to take a look at
 
this one.  Dr. Roffman first called re about this project.
 
Tn rough outline, she said that the deaf
, are develoring
 
signing into a literature -
.- they tell jokes, poems, proverbs
 
and other retaphoric forr
;s through an ever-increasing sinned
 
meta nhoric sysster, if this maYes any sense.
 She felt that
 
folklorists miobt be interested, as she put
, it, in :
setting
 
in on the beginning of a folkloric repertoire rather than
 
coming; in after the traOition had been thoroughly established.
 
Kind of intriguing. T thought.
 
she also says that there are nunerous deaf poets w
"ho are
 
cor,nosirg in sign language, ana her proposal was to d
ry a
 
videotape project at Gallaudt-t to document both
. the +
poetic
 
and the folkloric develo ments in this area.
 7
,fter a good
 
deal of conversation, I referred her to ovr person here who
 
deals with arts for the handicapper) who finally referred ber
 
to you.  ChTerall,  it seemed a k
nit academic in impact for our
 
particular pr mram, thouc*h T think we c
tonld hand y it if
 
Vou can' t.
 
Anyway. knowing of our interest, Fal Cannon sent the enclosed
 
letter one of his staff had written hack to us.
 It se es to
 
be in the work
. hvt T t
',
-otIght maybe this woul
.' be the kind of
 
project you and Patricia would like to keep track of.
 I h
.ave
 
not done the necessary homework on the proposal
 is Dr.
 
Hofftan cuali'fie' for the research, who else is working in
 
this area, has such a project already been un0ertaken by Sore -
body o etc. .  but the overall problem being addressed really
 
does seem to me to have special appeal.
 
2
 
Let p
si+ know if y
 on conclude thp
. Arts Rnlc+wment might be a more
 
congenial home.  Please understand I
'm
. just plain int:erestef?
 
I don `
 t have any idea whether or not the Folk Arts panel
 
would be,
 ?ut it foes, it seems to re, represent s
car
ce of the
 
kinds of projects you, Patricia, Sally and 
'T have talked
 
about.

Ethnic tours
 
Phil i
cauis
 
The attached brochure will give you an idea of the kind of
 
thing we can c
oo and are doing.  Currently, we are funding two
 
Irish tours and one French.  We have received applications for
 
one Appalachian tour (
in Appalachia), another Appalachian tour
 
(
into Ohio and
. Pennsylvania hitting urban centers where there
 
are lets of Appalachian in-migrants), and one Greek tour (
to
 
.
initiate in Ta rpon Springs and move through the south and the
 
eastern seaboard).  The latter three applications will be
 
reviewed by our June panel anu August Council.
 
By 1981, we could be funding the following potential touring
 
groups:
 
1
)
 Trish
 
2
)
 French -- two tours:  one through New England, as at
 
present, and one through Missouri and Louisiana
 
3
)  .
Appalachian -- two tours as above
 
4
)
 Mexican -- two tours:  one going through central
 
California valley and one through the midwest
 
5
)  Caribbean -- an extraordinary group from the island
 
of Carriacou is currently resident in New York.  All these
 
folks have other jobs, but they might be available for a limited
 
tour in 1981 if p
lanning w
ere t
o b
egin s
oon.  They should be
 
seen in any area where there are significant black populations;
 
they have an extraordinarily African dance and drumming style.
 
,
a)  Serbian -- not yet organized but a clear potential
 
7
)
 Polish -- also not organized by the possibilities
 
are fine
 
As a matter of fact, if we put our mind* to it, the potential
 
is all out there for any number of touring ensembles:  Scandina-
vian, Italian, Spanish (
Basques, Flamenco, Catalan, etc.).
 
Russian, Ukranian, Samoan, you nau a it.  We need -- as Melville
 
Put it -- only time, cash, and patience.
 
Ethnic Tours
 page two
 
z
 
Costs are more difficult to estimate, since some cultures
 
specialize in saio or small group ensembles and others in large
 
choirs and orchestras.  There is no way to present the Russian
 
choral tradition,  for example, without a groups of at least
 
sixteen.  The other factor is time; most of our tours are short --
two weeks waximusr, since we are dealing with artists who basically
 
support themselves by farming or reguA&r jabs and thus cannot get
 
away for extended periods.  For exaA
tple, the Italians, around
 
New York have jobs as might-watchwen and the likes they can only
 
get away over weekends.  Still, I can see us putting together a
 
"tour" for these that would run over, say,  six successive weekends
 
in and around the Hew York/New Jersey/Pennsylvania area,  reaching
 
a large number o
lf people.
 
on the whale, I think it would be rational to project $50,000 per
 
two-week tour per ethnic group; this is w
tore than we are spending
 
now, but we are budgeting mighty close to the bane, and casts will
 
have risen by 1
.981 anyway.  Besides, if one tour comes in more
 
cheaply (
notice, the Irish tour only re wires 7 performers) , tho
 
Mexican -- minimum 13 performers
, -- or the Caribbean -- at .
Least
 
20 woulu make up for it.
 
I have therefore }
projected 10 potential tours for 1931 at $50,000
 
each for a total of $100,000.  Frankly, we will go ahead and
 
mount as want
' of these anyway as we have the money for, but it
 
would be lovely to have some assurance well in advance so that
 
we could do some planning and not just respond to off-then-wail
.
 
requests.
 
I am also attaching xeroxes of the council pages for the last
 
two meetings with red lines drawn down the side of grants that
 
might suggest other "accessibility" activities than tours.
 Hope
 
it helps.
 Please call on i
re if I can contribute to some overall
 
olanning in this area.  There seems to r
oe to be many possibilities
 
as yet unexplored.

I have examined your proposed film project with much interest.
 
However, the national Endowment for the Arts does not, as of
 
this particular time, fund projects that take place overseas.
 
we are cooperating with the newly established International

them might stand you in good stead.  Address:

Another avenue might be theaugh the Smithsonian Institution.
 
As chance would have it, the Smithsonian is cooperating with
 
the national Endowment .
for the Humanities to sponsor a symposium
 
to bring together Egyptian and American scholars, during 1981,
 
I believe.  I have taken the liberty of forwarding your letter
 
to Ralph Rinzler, Director of the Folk Life Program at the
 
Smithsonian.  He is, I know, working on the advanced planning
 
for the symaposiuv and also has a personal interest in crafts.
 
As a matter of fact, he has produced two videotapes himself,
 
one on Korean pottery and another on a family of traditional
 
potters in Appalachia.  I expect you will be hearing from him
 
directly whether or not he can directly help with your problem.
 
with all best wishes to you in your search for funds, iaam

Dear Larry:
 
This is to confirm our conversation of this morning, during
 
which I told you that the Folk Arts panel had recommended
 
full funding in the case of the Southwest Lore Center's
 
request for assistance with the salary of a full-time folk
 
arts coordinator position.
 
The National Council of the Arts Endowment will review this
 
recc mendation on May 13; I cannot conceive of any circumstances
 
that would cause th us to reject or modify it.  From there, it
 
will go to Mr. Biddle, the Endo wment Chairman: for final
 
signature.
 
Technically speaking, the grant will not h*ve beet awarded until
 
Mr. Biddle signs it.  Practically speaking, however. the R,:
atter
 
has been settled.  The Folk Arts panel was extr4noly enthusiastic
 
in their reco mmendationi the National Council has recently
 
approved our 1980 guidelines in which the establishment of such
 
positions is stated as a goal of our Program.  Frankly, it's a
 
shoo-in.
 
1 do not think that the Endowment would have any objections
 
whatever to the University's preparing the paper
y-work to
 
establish this position in advance of the fo mai grant award.
 
Th "r only concern would be a public announcentent say, to the
 
newspapers, prior to Mr. Biddle's signing the grant.  Sometimes
 
he likes to announce them himself, for c
ane thing.
 
-2-
My own view would be that getting the paper work started and
 
even s
 a m
iencing the recruiting process would be perfectly all
 
right from the Endowment point of view, as long as the
,
 
announc ment of the award itself was delayed.  Please let
 
me know what your administrators feel about this, and let
 
me know also if there is anything I can do to forward this
 
project.  I am terribly happy about this grant and anxiously
 
looking forward to helping develop a fine folk arts program
 
throughout the state of Arizona.

Dear Jim:
 
Thank you so c
ouch for your thoughtful letter.
 I
'm awfully glad
 
that you enjoyed the meeting and felt that it was helpful to
 
you.  Makes me feel like all  )
ur efforts were well-spent.
 
I
, too, found the differences among the kinds of work people
 
are doing interesting and certainly worth some thought.
 
George Holt seemed to be in one end of the scale ; on the other
 
end were those people that are working with a very clear
 
academic bent . The latter seemed to me to be really removed
 
from the folk.  Bat so did just about everyone else.  That
 
rea Jy surprised me and has given us all much food for thought
 
Alan, Bess , and I have all wondered whether the conference was
 
structured to make this seem to be the case  (
in terms of what
 
we scheduled people to talk about) or whether the nature of
 
the positions people have make them focus more on work with
 
institutions than on work w
.:_th people.
 I
'd really be
 
interested in yjur feelings about this as you begin to work
 
in Arizona.
 I guess I ended up feeling that those of us
 
supposedly way far away from the action in Washington think
 
more often about helping people out than mist A the f
,3lk-
l
orrists working more on a local leve
 But I could be just
 
patting us an our collective back.
 
I
, to.i, was a bit distressed by the :
unwillingness  )
f the group
 
to talk about an assessment of their projects.
 '
gybe impact
 
and eval
�n are intim-_dating words.  Obvio_isly ind:
i.viduals
 
have to
 about what they have done and about h-3
w to do
 
it better.  They have some goals in mind when they do their
 
work and they do what they do in gays that attempt more or
 
less to realize those goals.
 I
'd hope that they alm to do
 
more than just keep their positions safe, but maybe this is
 
something that really needs to be addressed head on instead
 
of justkhoping that people will talk abut it at will.  We
 
- 2
 
al, realize that we've got a lot of hurdles to get over, but
 
it may be difficult to talk about our assessment of our own
 
rehative successes and failures publically.
 
I hope that everyone will have a chance to meet regionally or
 
at the American Folk.__)re Society meetings in between the
 
meetings in Washington, both to keep up to date and to share
 
ideas.
 You were right -- not everyone was invited to th-s
 
particular conference because we wanted to keep the meeting
 
at a manageable size.  Next time I
'd like to see more people
 
present.
 Perhaps to have small discussion :
sessions as well
 
as large _
)nos would help make this a more realistic goal.
 
What do you think?
 
Please keep in touch and let us know how things go for you.
 
I hope you'll e)ntinue to share your thoughts with us.
 It
 
would be nice if this meeting were the beginning of an on-
going dialogue among us all.  Would you mind if I sent
 
pe-)ple who were at the meeting a copy of your letter?  I
 
found it very thought provoking and would hope that others
 
might want to share their reactions to the meeting and to
 
yoar thoughts.
 
It was really gaod t, see you again.

Dear Mr. Chittenden s
 
First let me congratulate you pa pulling together such an
 
interesting conference.  The participants and the topics
 
seem to we just right.
 
As of now, I just am not sure whether or not anyone €ra
 
Folk Arta can attend, but I thank you very much for the
 
invitation.  As you may know, our travel funds are entsaa iy
 
limiter:, and we are about to run out of money in our m all
 
program.  We will see, however, if any further juggling r
eam
 
be da m.
 
in the nowtime, can I ask that you send announcements of
 
the conference to a few other people.  Have Whisnant would,
 
I's
, sure, t
reat very much to know about it, if you've not
 
already thought of his.  You can address him at 826 Glen Allen
 
Drive, Baltimore, Maryland.
 
I also spoke recently with Dr. Bruce Jackson, a folklorist at
 
Documentary Research, Inc. Se would be interestediin attending
 
the conference and can be written at 96 Rumssy Road, Buffalo,
 
New York  14209/
 
I have also had several meetings with Arthur Rashap of the
 
Erpf Cultural Center (Arkville, New York  12446) about their
 
cultural programs.  I am sure same member of their staff would
 
be interested in attending your conference.
 
_2-
Finally, I would appreciate it if you could send conference
 
information to John Wessel, the Endows
:ent's regional representative
 
for New Yock State.
 You can write his at 110 West 15th street,
 
New York, I
h m York  10011.  Whether or not he could attend
 
personally, I am sure he would g
rant to know of the meeting and
 
might be able to notify others as well.
 
I'll keep working; on sending up a Folk Arts representative.
 
In the meantime, I hope your pre-conference work goes smoothly.

Dear Mr. nauenhauer:
 
Thank you so much for your extremely interesting letter.
 I
 
am sorry to have de b
ayed answering, but i wanted t) check
 
your _
:
lea with .
3ur legal co.insel in order to make sure that,
 
if you applied for assistance from the Endowment, the vexed
 
issue of church-state would n .
t be raised.
 
Our regal counsel's opiai.,n endorses my  >
wnl that this project
 
reflects esseatialiy cultural rather than ral gious c
:)ncerne
 
I hope that in your final write-up of the project you c)ntinue
 
to stress this feature of yoir idea.  The whole church-state
 
issue, let me assure you,  is one that this Frogxam along with
 
others in the Arts Endowment, wrestles with continually
 
There is, as you well know, an enorm:)us quantity of the
 
worlds' art that stems directly out if religious convicti,n
 
and experience.
 we must, and do, recognize this, at the same
 
t me reaffirming those artistic qual:ties that speak to all
 
men rather than to a single sect.
 
The cross -cultural element in the songs you speak of is
 
clearly a fascinating feature of the repertotte that should
 
be documented and re-enforced.
 The new Alaskan-Morn melodies
 
are another remarkable feature of your nr)ject.  over all,
 
th ;
.
s seems to as an eminently worthy project, and I am
 
particularly happy with the idea of the singing events or
 
"get-tagsthers" as an occasion for documentation.  This is
 
the kind of th ng that oux advisory pane; particularly wants
 
to encaurage.
 
I shall enclose two copies of our guidelines for y

Dear Barre
 
I
 
I am enclosing a c-
.
Y p y  of the  etter Prim the Navajo folks
 
that I think I may have mentioned to you.
 It presents,  it
 
seems to me:
, an extraord ,_aarily sophist,.cated perspective,
 
and one which we must, in al  conscience, parsue, though
 
its ultimate realization way be far dawn the road.
 
I send it tD you for y
 lur Pereonal considerati jn, and also
 
because I understand you and Clyd:
ia are planning to got
 
together sometime this spring or s0mmsr for the consideration
 
of :
overall. strategies  :
.
s
a
a tarns of Fa i
k Arts program s and
 
Bative American cultare.
 It seams to me that when you do,
 
you might also consider making a couple of ancillary site
 
visits
 one to the l
ardy who wr .
tes us bore, and one to the
 
Maseum of Northern Ari- ona there (
as I think I have told you)
 
Dr. Robert B
 l
.ac t wants t) set up a ma
 j
 ,
yr i
 s .
*s itrar
 y for
 
Dative xmerican music and art for the entire southwest.
 
It seams to so that you and Clydia .
night be extraordinarily
 
helpful to the persannei of that m
+
.aseum in figuring out just
 
what role they eight be ably* to play in the servicing of
 
the northern Arizona tribes, and Falb Arts wDuld be happy
 
t , pay for any expeases inv alved .  I'd also like to be able
 
to respond to g
 X . claw's request.
 if you think it's a good
 
idea, just let 00  :
now when you might be able to mate it to
 
Arizona and I can,
 f you think it suitable, also axrange for
 
Dr. Black to UWWt y«u there.

 ch ran into Hazel Dickens recently who said that it
 
had been the best a£fa-r she had ever attended at K ghlander.
 
Concerning fending, I am enclos_
:_Ag a couple of applicat on
 
blanks for your use.  We have a deadline coming up the middle
 
of Apriis if you can get as an application by then, we can
 
get it to the June panel meeting where it will get most
 
serious review.  P
 `
.ease try to make that deadline if at all
 
poesiole; we can hand a only small emergency grants during
 
the s
aammex . The next real *pport3nity w }
u d be October 1.
 
In terms of what you a
: ght to do, it occurred to me in
 
reading through the material you sent that y,a  may not under-
stand clearty the crucial difference between gett -
ng grants
 
and fund-rail L n g .
 in the latter, what you have to d , is to
 
prove that you're g
 ,
ad guys, and people give you money on
 
the basis of what you have done to 9u  on doing it.
 In
 
getting grants, it wor cs just the  >
ther way.  Although
 
obviously y ,u have a better chance if you have done lots of
 
good things and have a "track record", the more important
 
factor is what y 3 u  would do with the money if you gat it --
your olans axe the cr tical thing.
 
In terms of your pr posal, you could ask us for funding Or
 
a series of worksho -)
a either at Highlander or in the: general
 
mountain area, but a
re would need t 3  know h k w  many, where,
 
wha might be invited, haw mich each would cast, etc.  Or we
 
could support a tour of the mining area, as we discaveed a
 
year or two ago.  Generally, the pane  has not funded news-
letters, or aongbooks, though I su?pase there has ti be a
 
first time eventually.
 in terms  �
f records, the -
,aael has
 
dec.

Dear Sally:
 
I
'm writing
: this on I
'
Monday morning, even though I have a slight
 
case of j
et lag and r
ay typing ability isn't up to its us&ally low
 
standard,  so that I don't forget the thinNs I feel need saying
 
about those highly rewarding meetin7s last weekend
.. In t
'�e first
 
place,  they were highly rewarding. I got out of them what I needed,
 
along with some unexpect&d and exciting benefits. In addition,
 
the followin7 points strike me as being worth mentl oninga
 
Possibly the most significant statement of the weekend was made
 
Saturday by George Holt when he told u- that *** documentation
 
of folk culture does not e
qual preservation of folk culture.
 
I found it interesting that none of us, myself included, was
 
ready to discuss that one. I personally will be wrestlin7 with
 
the idea for a long time.In his description of his work, George
 
also revealed himself as the only -
person in the room who didn't
 
keen at least an eye cocked towards the needs of the academic
 
community. This is to condemn nei_thtr George nor the rest of us- its
 
just an observation of a difference between us.
 
Another thing that struck me was that m 5t p.oplP were ;
more interest-
ed in discussing work with institutiot
 i e
 �
ls is probably
 
a reflection of the realities and frustrations of the jobs they hold,
 
it worried me a bit that so much emphasis was placed unon service
 
to institutions,**4 vather than on service to people. This is most
 
liley a product of my inexperience and personal prejudices, however.
 
The only slightly disturbing aspect of the sessions was a certain
 
reluctance on the part of almost everyone there to assess and
 
evaluate projects. It seems to me that if we are going to survive
 
as effective workers we must develop tools for evaluating that
 
effectiveness, and for convincing others of it. I got the feeling
:
 
that most people at the table were more interested in doing thalh
 
in asse�-sin7 the impact of their acts. I hope this changes.
 
There are several people working as regional or statep -)
lklorists
 
who were not at the meetings, probably because it woi.ld have made
 
the whole thing too big and unwieldy. Perhaps in future years
 
this nnoblem could be solved by holding regoonal meetings- I
 
know personally the enormous validating; effect that "being called to
 
Wa-hington" can have for at least this Provincial Person, and I
 
assume that I
'm not unique in this. An important result of thf
-se
 
sessions is the feelin:? that "we are not  .
lone"- a g
rood reason
 
to try to find ways to enlarge the scope as opposed to changing
 
the participants.
 
Once a7ain, thanks for I
t
lan exciting weeken(

Dear Mr. Switkes:
 
Thank you for your proposal to the Arts $ndowment's Folk Arts
 
program.
 
Although your proposed film of such a fine traditional artist
 
as "Queen" Ida Gu .
Ulory clearly fit& ;mr guidelines, I feel I
 
should inf ,
3
rm you that our advisory pane`
s has recently been
 
tending to fund very few media proposals , and the chances of
 
,
)btaining funding would be slice.  At a recent policy meeting,
 
they decided to give Folk Arts funds on'y to the most extra-
ordinarily high quality and badly needed projects.  one of
 
the main reasons for this decision was the skyroc <
<eting costa
 
of filmmaking and the alarming rate at which media projects
 
were taking money away from our live presentational
. projects.
 
With a relatively small budget such as ours , this could
 
easily become a serious problem.
 
In the case that you still wish to a
�>ply, I an enclosing F
 
3
1
 
Arts application forms . Our next deadline is April 1
.
 
Accompanying your applicati = sho z
ld be the f31lowing kinds
 
of support material: 1
) a ten-minute sample of your film-
making (
the content should be a sensitive, humanistic treat-
ment
 
->
f a human subjec ts 2
) a letter of consent from the
 
film subject ; 3
) your rea ms and resumes if any other of the
 
major people inv 3
lved in the making of the film; 4
) a brief
 
treatment of the proposed film= 5
) a breakdown of equipment
 
costs and the types of equipment ta
) be used; and 6
) distri-
bution plans for the final product.  The last item has been
 
of increasing concern to our advisory panelists ; they want
 
to be as certain as possible that any film funded by Folk
 
Arts will get ample exposure.

Dear Mr. Reed and Ms. Dickeys
 
It was pleasant meeting with you the other day.  After you
 
had gone, I learned that Professor Nelson Graburn of the
 
Anthropology Department of the University of California at
 
Berkeley has  atereested himself recently in the impact of
 
tourism on native pJpulations .  In fact, he has even edited
 
a boo
 3
n the subject , a colL
iection of essays titled
 
"Tourist and Bthnic Arta" or something close to that.  The
 
book came out a year or s� ago and should be reasonably
 
available . It also occurred to me that since he is so near
 
by, you might want to call
: on Dr. Graebarn and discuss your
 
work with him.
 
I
'm sorry not to have ment _
_onsd this when you were in

i, but the last time I saw Dr. Graeburn he was
 
working on Eskimo child s
•acialization.

to pay him a call, please give his al regards.

Dear Professors Mackearie, I

Thank you for your interesting letter.
 I have discussed your
 
idea with our prafessiona  staff aad they concur with my
 
opin'Lon that this is really not a project that falls within
 
our program guidelines.  You may, of course, decide to apply
 
anyway; how w mr, I believe if you read through the brief pro-
gram description that A
l  enclase, you will agree.  our pragram
 
is designed to encourage the practice of folk arts; the pro-
ject you describe is really a research effort.
 
You might consider sending a letter of enquiry to the Research
 
Division at the Rational Endowment for the Humanities.  The
 
address is: 845-15th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 205©5.
 
I might also suggest that there are a number 4f people in
 
F orida who w:
.yuld be interested to :
learn of your idea and
 
sight have suggestions for local .
funding possibilities.  one
 
is Peggy Bulger, who is a fo -,klorist attached to the Stephen
 
Foster Memorial in White Springs.  Peggy works full-time
 
around the state, and is knowledgable about state resources.
 
You might also consider getting in touch with R
l

and David Clossen in the Suglish Department at the University
 
of Florida, and Alan Burris in the Department of Anthr apology
 
at the same institution.  All three are active in f

As you kWW, the F =

though, they have weakened on several occasi,3ns , and I think
 
you put the argument for third year funding in this case

Dear Stephan:
 
The decision about whether to apply to Media Arts or to Poly.
 
Arts is, of caursae, Hr. Bookhardt'ss.  The major difference
 
is that the primary consideration of the Media folks is the:
 
artistic quality of the film itself, regardless of top)
.c,
 
while Palk Arts w--#
u d loo's first at the topic and then at the
 
expertise of they fiLmaker in documentation and a

My own reactian to the proposal is that it is too d

ffuse: at

you need not sand any of that information again.  we will
 
need a film sample of about ten minutes in length produced
 
by the film-maker you will use.  The sample can be a ten minute
 
section of larger files if t
 hat is necessary= just describe
 
to us where to start the section you want the panel to see.
 
The film s
ample need not be sent in until early Mayt it
 
absolutely must be in hand in this office by May 151 fi
t we
 
prescreen all film samples and our access to film equip ment
 
if limited.  The sample `
+ill be returned directly after the
 
panel meeting the first week of *tne.
 
Should you have any further questions about this application,
 
please don •
 t hesitater to call or write again.
 
Cordially,

P.S. The pastel has requested in the case of film projects that
 
a rough s
ample film treatment be submitted along with the
 
a
►pplicatioa.  Perhaps your film-maker can provide you with a
 
sample, d
emonstrating how he intends to approach one of these
 
topics.

Thank you for your interesting proposal.  I have ventured to

who has recently assumed the office of Folk Arts Coordinator
 
at the Louisiana Arts Council
,.  Hr. Spitzer can be reached at.

I an sure he will be interested to know of your project and
 
will a
vant to he of help to you, if possible.
 
In t*
=4 of the Polk Arts Peogram, I must tell you that our
 
advisory panel has becore greatly concerned of late about the
 
proportion of our limited funds that is consyseed by d Wwwastation
 
projects, especially film and video.  There simply is not enough
 
soneey to handle all the worthy documentation ideas that roach
 
this office daily.  We must find less expensive means to roach
 
our objectives.
 
Have you, by any i
ce, considered whether or not the music
 
of the Coolie family might not be preserved through producing
 
a record?  An UP. of their music would cost far lose to
 
produce and sight even be more readily available to their
 
own co
a
unity and friends.
 
If you feel, on the other hand, that sight is as important as
 
sound in the preservation of the art of the Coolie family, can
 
you give our reviewing panel some assurance that your work
 
L
 
-2-
Will be widely distributed?  We have found, to our deep
 
regret, that many projects we have sponsored have not
 
reached the target audiences for which they were conceived.
 
A comprehensive distribution plan would greatly enhance
 
any application you would submit to us.
 
If you should decide to apply to us, we would require a
 
sponsoring organisation with non-profit status.  we would
 
also require a O
ng match, a good part of which could
 
be in-kind.  We will also need a rough script outline and
 
a sample of film or video work that you have already pro-
duced.  The sample should be approximately ten m#nutes
 
(
you can of course designate a ten minute section of a
 
longer piece), and it should reach us by May 1
.  The
 
application itself, which is included in the enclosed
 
guideli;es, should be sent in by April 1 in triplicate.
 
One of the copies should be in original typescript and
 
contain original signatures in ink, the better to be repro-
duced by our xerox machiney the other two may be xeroxes
 
or carbons.
 
Please don't hesitate to get in touch with us by mail or
 
telephone -- 202/634-4282 if you have further questions.
 
Call person-to-Ve4won collect and we will return your call
 
on the rented federal line.  Or perhaps you would do well to
 
discuss your proposal with Nick Spitzer; he might be able
 
both to help you locate a sponsoring organisation and local
 
funding for the matching purposes.

Dear Mr. Payton:
 
Thank you for your letter.  I am enclosing a copy of the
 
brochure that explains the current Folk Arts grogram for
 
your consideration.
 
The Folk Arts Program is the smallest program in the entire
 
Encoww mt.  With the smallest total budget and the largest
 
potential constituency to serve, we have had to select our
 
priorities very carefully.  As of 1979, we have determined
 
the most urgent task we can perform is to support traditional
 
musicians and artists within their own cm=unities rather
 
than to assist in tours of the type you describe.
 
I w
orry we ars not in a position to help you as of this
 
YO
 W.
 Have you by any chance approached your own state
s arts

 S matinesr it is easier to get local than national
 
funding.  Why not address a letter similar to the one you

I am sorry the Falk Arts Prograsa cannot be of assistance to
 
you at this time, and I thank you for your interest in the
 
program.  You might also wish to enquire again another year;
 
we have no reason to believe that our current guidelines are
 
cast in concrete.
 
Yours sincerely,

You will probably be surprised to hear from se again, but at

Some time later, Pete Seeger, who is one of our panel sotbers,
 
sent me the enclosed note that he had written you.  He had
 
forgotten to note down your address and asked that it be
 
forwarded.  in the meantime, the Program's secr etary resigned
 
and your letter was temporarily misplaced.  Hence the delay.
 
I hope it arkives in tins to be of some assistance.  In any

Dear Mrs. Callister:
 
Thank you for y
,our letter about the Festival of the American
 
West.
 I am sure it is a splendid event.
 
The National Endowment for the Arts acts as a granting agency
 
exclusively, and we maintain no lists of local craftsworkers
 
or musicians.
 
I am sorry we cannot be of help in this particular instance.
 
It **ava to me you might get better results by consulting
 
Sal Cannon at the Utah State Arts Agency or Professor Bert
 
wilson, both of whom are highly knowledgebb " in Utah folklife.
 
'
Where in just no way than any agency " Washington, D
.C. can
 
keep in touch with the hundreds of thousands of traditional
 
crafts workers all across the country, so that my standard
 
advice to people in your position is to consult their friendly
 
local folklorists.
 
May 1
, however, offer you my warm wishes for a most successful
 
festival.

I'm afraid, though, that they preclude our being able to help
 
you with your very interesting project.  The Arts Endowment as
 
a wholes is charge d with the support of living arts and artists=
 
occasionally our museaurs Program gets into the arts of the
 
past, but the other programs typically do not.
 
Ir seems to a
rea that you have a project that would be of real
 
interest to the s
tational Endov=ent for the OMmanitieas.  They
 
saw n to be pretty active in the area of archaeology.
 You
 
aight submit a letter of the kind you wrote we either to
 
Sol Cannon of the Research Division or to Marty Sullivan, newly
 
appointed director of the Special. Projects Division at
 
Humanities.
 (

 Personnally, I think
 
I should try Mr. Sullivan firsts he is especially concerned
 
at this time in developing projects that speak to local and
 
conounity concerns.
 
You might also consider dropping a line to Bernard Keel at
 
the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service in the
 
Department of the Interior, but you are probably already
 
in touch with him.

Dear Jeannette:
 
I simply don't understand ghat has happened to the mail.  A
 
diligent search has turned up only one of the three letters
 
you say you sent us, and that had been put in the wrong place
 
by our departing secre " ry so that n "ther I nor Sally had
 
seen it.  I don't believe the other two ever arrived.
 
we have hastened to take care of your requests for an extension
 
of the project and for funding.  Martha Kuenhold, our grants
 
officer, has walked the papers as far as they can be walked
 
personally, and tells me you should expect a
► letter from the
 
Grants office extending the project in three to four weeks,
 
and the cash r
at payment in ten days.
 (Project extensions
 
are quite routine from the EadwA
iment point of vier and thus
 
get shoved to the back of the list of things to he done
 p you
 
should consider the extension already granted and carry on
 
from here.)  Please let me or Martha Kuenhold know by phone
 
if there is any further delay on either of these issues.
 
I am, of course, delighted that your project is going along so
 
splendidly.  I hope you will eventually discuss the whole
 
enterprise with Charlotte Heth (the Cheokee Ph.D. ethnomusicolo-
gist who beads the Dative American Studies program at U.C.L.A.).
 
we have helped fund her to develop a videotape and tape recording
 
archive of Native American culture at U.C.LOA. and I know she
 
will be fascinated to hear of your materials and techniques.
 
Actually, her Center might be an appropriate place for you to
 
put a protection copy of your tapes (
under whatever restrictions
 
you and the Cahuillas want to place
: on them, odf course).
 I

also believe -- though I am not sure of this -- that Char

this unseemly delays I may get a few weeks behind, but i
 
always answer my sail.  Maybe if you use the street address
 
on further letters, it a
light be safear&

Dear Mr. Borrup:
 
Thank you for your recent letter.  I a
rm venturing to answer it
 
myself, since Sally Yerkovich is at have due to illness.
 
It looks to me as though your project is in reasonably good
 
order.  I must warn you, in a 2ro forma ray, that the Folk Arts
 
panel has recently became concerned with the proportion of its
 
small annual funding allocation that has been going into media
 
documentation; you might, therefore, want to beef up your
 
application as strongly as you can.
 
You'll need, of course, to sub mit a sample of your video work.
 
This should reach us (assuming you decide to apply for our
 
April 1 deadline:) by the end of the month (April) at the latest.
 
Please s
emd us no more than ten minutes of a a mple thst exhibits
 
your technical and cultural sensitivity) this can be a part of
 
a longer piece, if you let us know which bit you want to be
 
sure that the panel seer.
 
I would think the panel would also want to know just where you
 
intend to film, and, if pertinent, what groups or individuals
 
have expressed interest in being filmed.
 (You don't have to
 
give us a detailed list of dram4tis oeraonnae, but we do need
 
to know that some of these folk* don't mind your barging in
 
with cameras.)
 Jane Beek should he able to help support this
 
by her c
yan personal assurances.
 
-z-
Your budget seem quite reasonable (
maybe even shaved a bit too
 
fine), and your distribution plans in good order.
 Why not go
 
ahead and apply to use in April.  I shall enclose a not of
 
our guidelines that contain our application blanks.  Please
 
return three copies, one of which should be in the original
 
typescript with original signatures in ink (
the better to
 
fit our xerox machine).  Don't hesitate to include as much
 
back-up material -- vitas of the principal people to be
 
involved in the project, tentative "script" outlines, and
 
the like -- as you have available.  our panel likes lots of
 
information, but does not respond well to large fat mushy
 
"professional" documents.  Send us in what you have available
 
by April 1; we can always include addenda later in the month,
 
and we will get back in touch with you anyway if there are
 
any glaring inadequacies.  It might relieve you to know that
 
the Folk Arts staff fights hard on the side of
 i ts applicants
 
and tries to help the
ta get into Shod shape.
 
with all best regards, I am,

A d, by the way, may I ask you foraa favor?  we are preparing

Mould there be a possibility that you would let us reproduce
 
photograph "A" -- the one of the gentleman working on the hull,
 
I think -
-- or perhaps you would have another photograph that
 
you think might reproduce (in s wZl scale) better,'  We like to
 
use pictures that stem from our own projects whasever possible.
 
There is no great rush on this.  You could let me know when
 
you send in your application.

Dear Mr. West z
 
Thank you for your interesting letter.  Your proposal seems
 
one that could be addressed by the Falk Arts Program, and 2 am
 
enclosing a copy of our guidelines (containing application forms)
 
for your use.  our next deadline is April 1.  Please include
 
three conies of the application foss, one of which should be in
 
the original typescript and contian original signatures in ink
 
so that our merox machine can repeeduce it clearly.  You should
 
also send along vitas of the three collaborators, and a tenta-
tive table of contents or s list of singers/story tellers you
 
might consider using.  A short sample tape would also be
 
helpful, demonstrating both the kind of material you would
 
include and the technical quality of the recording.
 
The panel has been worrying ab ut the whole recording issue
 
recently, in view of the fact that the commercial market, on
 
the whole, is handling traditional music such better than is
 
any other form of the media.  They are concerned lest we in-
advertently interfere with what is basically going along pretty
 
well without federal assistance.  For that reason, the panel
 
no =
ially confines its funding to help with research costs,
 
performers'  fees, and costs for writing and production of
 
abbum booklets -- all of them items that tend to be underM c
eded
 
or eliminated entirely by commercial recording companies.  we
 
do not help with basic pressing costs.
 
This leads me to wonder if you are wise to consider doing this
 
entirely on your o  - Have you thought about approaching a
 
small record company with the idea?  2 should think County
 
a
right very well be interested, for instances they appear to
 
-2-
have an excellent distribution network at least in Appalachia
.,
 
and you could still sell the record at the Canter.  You should
 
think about this question anyway and b
 e prepared to justify
 
the way you decide to handle it in your final
. application.
 
(
In case you are wondering, we have taken on the costs listed
 
above in the production of records that were later released
 
by Rounder, County, Folkways, etc.)
 
We'll look forward to receiving your application.  Intthe
 
neantime, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to write
 
again, or call person-to-person collect at 202/634-4282 and
 
one of us will return your call on the federal line.

There are many specific Observations I could make, of course,

traditional musicians, singers sod dancers in the classroom as
 
well as craftsmen.  A sure central suggestion might be to
 
recr mend that this document should receive the widest -
-ircula-
tion possible among all the American states so that we can
 
begin to determine where such progrvAes s
lay already be going on
 
and what the results have been.  There is a shocking lack of
 
cultural comounication within this hemispheres for instance, Z
 
only today discovered that our nearest northern neighbor,
 
Canada, has a highly active folk arts program carried on under
 
governmental sponsorship.  It would be most useful to discover
 
whether or not they have att4opted the use of folk arts in
 
schools both among their Native American, Eskimo and European
 
populations.

 Perhaps by September you might be

Dear Ms. Wondis far$ s
 
In reference to the tattoo artist film, the sequence of
 
events as reflected in -
aur records is as follows:
 
An application for matching funds to support this film was r
e-
ceived by the rolk Arts Program during the fall of -
.977.  The
 
application came from the Columbus College of art and Design
 
and was signed by Dean Joseph Canrani a
s Authorizing Official
 
and by Ala n 3
. G-j
venar as Project Director.  We logged the
 
applications in as R80-54-44.
 
The project was reviewed and recommended by the Folk Arts
 
Pane�.
 s
 of 1977.  The a  lication next went to the
 
f
iat �
-
enal Council and finally to Chairman Livingston L. Biddle,
 
Jz., who signed the award letter on March 28, 1978.  The
 
asount awarded by the National Endowment was $8,435.
 
in April, we received a letter from Mr. G
:�veenar requesting
 
the grant peri
-od be extended to December 31,  -
1
.
378, a request
 
which we grantee'
!
 May 15 , 1i78.
 
on November 1Q, I received a telephone call from Mr. Gove
rnar
 
saying that irreconcilable differences had devel3ped between
 
him and the two other m
e mbers of the film team -- Dennis Aig
 
and Stephen Irmo.  After checking with our General Caunael's
 
3ffice , I confirmed to Mr . Govenar the fact that, as Project
 
Director, he was empower ed t
 3 select the personnel involved
 
in the grant.  I requested, however , that if he chose anather
 
film director , he apply for approval for the individual
 
selected from the Falk Atts Panel, as the ;
)anal had recom-
mended the award on the basis not only of f
ir . Govenar's
 
expertise in the subject area but also on the quality of Mr.
 
Irmo `
 s film work.
 
.  2 .
.
 
Mr. Govenar later telephoned me to say that he had decided to
 
replace Mr. Irmo with Bruce Lane, a filmmaker already well-
�
cnown to our panel.  Since this was the case, Z authorized him
 
to go ahead without submitting to further panel review.
 
In a urae to a further reque s
at fram Mr . Canzani , we have
 
extended the grant period to September 1
, 19T).
 
This is hew the matter stands now in terms of our official
 
records.  I have spoken recently with both Alan G
:3venar and
 
Bruce Lane.  It seems highly probable that spiralling infla-
tion, along with the loss of time regultisng from the dis-
agreements between the original tears, has made the original
 
budget impracticable.  I think that Mr. Govenar in planning
 
to return to the panel with a req.a
eat for additional monies
 
at our next meeting
 (
I should in fairneaes state that
 
several other fils makers we have funded are in exactly the
 
same difficulty, and they got along together like angels;
 
film co
s
sets are simply going out of eight even as I write.)
 
I cannot, of course, predict whether or not oar reviewing
 
p
4*nl will decide to support this fil
ls with additional funds.
 
W
eed, we have not even gotten a written request or a revised
 
budget as yet . I can say, I think, that the panel has been
 
sympathetic in the past to film makers whose costa had risen
 
markedly during the period between making out the original
 
budget and receiving the award.  I can also say that the
 
panel was interested in the film topic to beg L
n with and
 
f
 e
e
 It that Mr. Gov
venar '
 a
s proposal was well considered.
 
I hype this letter gives you the information you need for your
 
records.  Please don't hesitate to write or phone again, if
 
there i
an anything further I can tali you,
.

Dear Marla:
 
This is to confirm the substance of the conversation you
 
recently had with Martha Kuenhold, Folk Arts' Grants officer.
 
The Foresta Board should rest assured that the Arts Endowment
 
has various methods of handling problems developing out of our
 
matching requirement.  In the first place,  any organization
 
has until t
he end of the granting period to raise the match,
 
and the granting period can be extended if necessary by a
 
simple request.
 
Secondly,  revised budgets can be filed at any time,  through
 
negotiation with the Program responsible for the grant.
 
Several such revisions can be filed, if necessary, for the
 
seise grant.
 
Fr
 the point of view of the Folk Arts Program, your current
 
method of proceeding is totally appropriate, and the one adopted
 
by many of our grantees.
 It is rare that an applying organiza-
tion has its match in hand at the beginning of a grant.
 Typical-
ly they adopt your method, withdrawing Endowment funds as they
 
raise the match, making sure that Endowment monies are spent
 
.
for the purposes stated in the application.
 The budget can
 
always undergo a final revision at the and of the granting
 
period.
 
Y really hope that the Foresta Board will take this letter as
 
an indication of Endowment support for the Nevada Folk Arts
 
project.  We are committed to assisting our grantees during
 
-2-
and after the grant period, and assure you of our administra-
tive support.  It seems to me the Board may be unnecessarily
 
alarmed at this early stage.  I would appreciate it if you
 
would give them our assurances of cooperation.  If I can be
 
of further assistance or if there are any specific questions
 
I can answer, please let r
ye know.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hewes

I am enclosing a check for the sloop fund that you inadvert-
ently enclosed with your letter to Annette Mader.
 If I can
 
find her letter and address, I shall certainly send yours
 
along to her.  What such people need,  I believe, much more
 
than money l is caring -- plain old
. t.l.c.
 They need to be
 
taken seriously and
. they need to take themselves seriously,
 
so that they put on the best, most deeply-considered, care-
fully-thought-about festival that ever happened
..
 
But all the thinking and
. research and ideas in the world
 
aren't worth anything if the love isn't there to begin with.
 
Every once in a while, during this crazy job of mine,  I think
 
about once when the children were small and we were poor and
 
they went to a very working-class, not very good public
 
school.
 They had a Halloween carnival on the playground and
 
I went over during the afternoon and
, visited the little booths
 
they had put up -- a fish pond
. and
. a bean bag toss and
.
 
various little games like that.
 It was a benefit carnival
 
for the PTA, so everything cost a little bit -- two cents or
 
a nickel -- very exciting.  Anyway, one of the booths had
 
those nasty little crushed paper leis you used to see
 
around
. -- purple and
. hot pink and yellow -- selling for a
 
penny apiece.
 The lady who ran the booth was black, and
 
she was playing awful fake Hawaiian pop music on a tinny
 
little phon raph, and
. she had
. on a fake grass skirt over her
 
housedress, and it was altogether tawdry and awful.
 Since
 
I had met her at the PTA,  I complimented her insincerely on
 
how nice her booth looked
., and she looked at me with a big
 
generous smile and
. said,  "I put this booth up every year,
 
Mrs. Hawes.  I just think it's so good
. for children to learn
 
something about how it is to live in another part of the
 
world
.! "
 
2 -
 
The folks always know what the problem is.
 I went home think-
ing that she was doing a heck of a lot more about world
. peace
 
than I was with all my cultural pretensions.
 She was putting
 
herself on the line in her way, the best way she' knew, and we
 
must put ourselves on the line in our ways, the best we know
 
too.
 The crazy thing to me about this job is that the only
 
thing we have to work with is money.  Most of the time, you
 
think that if you only had enough money, everything could be
 
all right.
 Not true.
 
t
i
 
The next time you come down,  I
'll show you what the Luiseno
 
Indians of southern California did with time, patience,  love,
 
expertise, concern, professionalism, unity, clear thinking,
 
devotion -- and $6,000 of Folk Arts money.
 It's almost
 
parenthetical.  Anyway,  it made my week.

Dear Bills
 
Thanks so much for sending &Umg the list of performers at
 
the ninth Annaul Jubilee Old Time Mountain Festival.  I have
 
taken the liberty of forwarding it along to the American Folk-
life Center at the Library of Congress, in case they would like
 
to try to cover it.  As you kne w, the Arts Bnd
doi ment can't
 
really o
d  anything except fund other people.  it gets
 
frustrating sometimes.
 
I'm also sending copies along to Appalshop and County Records.
 
!
Maybe they will catch a spark.
 
I am sure you yourself are looking around for recordists.  Let
 
me make a suggestion or two in case you decide
r to do it
 
yourself. Lon't take a €oedline of the p.a. system.  In fact,
 
the best thing to do would probably be to pick out the folks
 
you really want to record and get them together in some quiet
 
place offstage.  You get better recording quality that wayf
 
many of these folks are not completely versed in hike tech-
niques, and festival performances, though frequently exciting,
 
are equally often distorted by the p.a. system and its --
and the performers' -- vagaries.
 
one other thing in case you didn't know -- Bobby Fulcher is
 
working with Dee and relta Sick# to record their enormous
 
t
 
-2-
combined repertoire.  A number of records ou#ht to come out
 
of this enterprise, so it probably not be w thh your time
 
to record them extensively, unless it is with other performers
 
they enjoy singing with.
 
Again thanks -
-- and best of luck.

Dear Dr. Quirarte:
 
Mary Ann Tighe just sent s
ue the resumes of two persons you
 
suggested as possible Folk Arts panelists -- Yolanda woo and
 
Beatriz Lopez.  I want to thsak you very much for your
 
suggestions and assure you that I will be in touch with both
 
of these extremely interesting women as soon as possible.
 
Since the Folk Arts Program is small, we have a single small
 
panel (numbering nine members in all) handling both policy and
 
application review.  Therefore, we have only a limited number
 
of possibilities for new panel appointements each year.  And
 
then -
- again because we are small - I like to meet prospective
 
panelists before they are appointed, if at all possible, so as
 
to get s
ome sense of how they might work together.  Either
 
Dan Sheehy or I will be taking a west coast trip during the
 
late spring, and we will make sure to call on both Ms. Woo and
 
Me. Lopez to discuss the Folk Arts Program with them and get
 
a sense of the degree of their interest.
 
For the present year, you will be glad
., I know, to hear that
 
Professor Ricardo Alegria, who founded the institute of
 
Puerto Rican Culture, has agreed to join the Folk Arts panel.
 
I feel very honored to have such a distinguished scholar and
 
such an imaginative and concerned cultural worker as a panelist.
 
Besides, it pleases my sense of geographic fairness to have a
 
representative from the island itself.
 
-2-
Again, my sincere thanks for your suggestions . I hope you
 
will send me names of other people you meet who might be inters
 
ested in our program.  Even if we cannot get them on to our panel,
 
we night be able to persuade them to act as consultants.  We
 
need t
ares and ears and thoughtful advisors all over this
 
enormous nation of ours.
 
I hope, by the way, that you will be able to find the time to
 
consult with Dan Sheehy about his forthcoming southwest trip.
 
There is so much that we should be doing with Hispanic people
 
in your area of the country.  I think much of the problem is that
 
many Mexican-Americans don't know that we exist, and that is
 
what I hope van's trip will help to combat.
 
I shall enclose a couple of Polk Arts brochures for your user
 
please
, help us spread them around.

meeting, several panel members woudered if it would not be a
 
gaod ide
as to charge a modest fee to the school

which the albums would be affered.  Under these circu mstances,
 
I have no hesitation in agreeing with the request in your
 
letter of Decewber 20, 1AW.
 I also confirm our mutua I ander-

be ao prab'sm in yous producing the f

Dear Mr. M
.Lohler r
 
I really do apol-g ire for taking sa long to answer your letter
 
enquiring about the p3asibility of a film concerning William
 
Hornsby.  What happened was that I phoned Rager Abrahams at
 
the University of Texas to got hi8 reaction as the project;
 
he knew nothing about Mr. Hornsby but said he would look into
 
the situation himself and report at a panel meeting in early
 
January.  During the interim, how4nar, Anger was bedded for
 
some wee
rks with back spasms and the whole u tter slipped his
 
si
red, as  .
t did mine too. I'm afraid.
 
That is a poor way for an officer of the federal government
 
to behave, and I apologize again.  Let s
ee hasten to send you
 
an application blank and such w
:
.>rds of wisd = as I can summon
 
up.
 
I F
aust warn you, I think, that the panel has become increasingly
 
cancerned about funding films.  The problem
's are many, but most
 
of them revolve around two factors: cost and distribution.
 
Film costs are rising astronamieally7 we are beginning to see
 
the possibilities that all of our extremely L
imited budget may
 
be used up  n documentation, if we are not careful.
 (You
r might
 
want to think
. a
la
:,)
ut S m.)  The --
)
tber problem in that so few of
 
the films that we have funded are actually seen by any kind of
 
a sizeable audience.  our 1980 guidelines will cantain, ther e-
fore, the a
n "ous statement that we will probably fund only a
 
few major fil m on subjects of the *
greatest importance by the
 
most highly technically qualified filmmakers.
 
s
 
- 2
 
M 
The second problem i see �n your project is the issue of the
 
"naive artist %  On th
is whole , the panel has stayed out of
 
this kind of priject, though, frankly. this  k
.
s a point of dis-
agreement between the staff and the panelists.  I think, when
 
You W itO
 up Your PCoJect description , you would be wise to
 
include s
csee tie-ins between mr, Hornsby's work and the
 
general issue of black aesthetics . I can see the reason for
 
the panel 's reservations on this issue, there are indeed an
 
awfu.
l lot of self-proclaimed naive artists.  we could no "r
 
fund t
hem all, so you will
 have to come up with some goad
 
folklaric rat.onale for this particular gentleman.
 
if you decide to go ahead and apply for a fi -
M grant, we will
 
need a sample of your previous f
.i lm
. work.  This can be sent

For the present year, you will be glad, I know, to hear that
 
Professor Ricardo Alegria, who founded the institute of
 
Puerto Rican Culture, has agreed to join the Folk Arts panel.
 
I feel very honored to have such a distinguished scholar and
 
such an inaginative and concerned cultural worker as a panelist.
 
Besides, it pleases s
py sense of geographic fairness to have a
 
representative from the island itself.
 
-2-
Again, my sincere thanks for your suggestions.  I hope you
 
will send me names of other people you meet who might be inters
 
ested in our program.  Even if we cannot get thee
; on to our panel,
 
we might be able to persuade their to act as consultants.  We
 
need VVes and ears and thoughtful advisors all over this
 
enormous nation of ours.
 
I hope, by the way, that you will be able to find the time to
 
consult with Dan Sheehy about his forthcoming southwest trip.
 
Where is so ru
uch that we should be doing with Hispanic people
 
in your area of the country.  z think much of the problem is that
 
many Mexican-Americans don't know that we exist, and that is
 
what I hope ran`s trip will help to combat.
 
I shall enclose a couple of Folk Arts brochures for your use

Dear Professor Petersen:
 
I
'm awfully sorry to have dela
y so long in answering your
 
letter.  About all I can may in answer to your question is
 
that Joe Wilson has pxoduced Buse extremely fine rec )
rdings
 
biasoIf , and I generaily value his advice.  Certainly the
 
technica l quality of his work has been first-class, and, if
 
he says an S M engineer is goad, I wauld certainly antici-
pate him to be exactly that.
 
A* far as handing "ready-made" products to a record c
,�mpany,
 
that is one )f the better ways to go, unless you happen to
 
ran the record company y
_),ureetlf .  It's a gaol way to gat
 
around same of the financial ca
ret-accounting roadblocks
 
some of the loss affluent and less culturally concerned record
 
companies will throw in your way.
 
With all best wishes for the success of your project,
 
Hastily,

Dear Mt.  Barnett t
 
Thank you for your letter.  I an sorry to have been so tardy
 
in replying ; this has been an extraordinari4y busy month.
 
I enclose f
.ar your infarmation a copy of the -
I
rolk Arta
 
guide .ines . You will notice that our program -- the smallest
 
in the entire Arts Endowment -- has a very limited objectivet
 
the support of traditional arts where they are.  We there-
fore rarely fend t
.wurs of any kind.
 
I am sorry about this.  If we had more money , we could do
 
more
 However , with a l
imited budget , we have had to focus
 
sharply on what seems to our adv.sory pa wl the main ob-
jective : the support of senior traditiomal artists within
 
their _a  cozsmtnities , so that "the prophet shall not be
 
without honor in his own caMsntry".
 
The Dance Program at the Rational Endowm ent for the Arts,
 
has a mar* active touring program.  The competition for their
 
€ands is extremely stiff , bowever, I shall enclose a copy
 
of their guidelines for your use in case you should decide
 
to try.
 
to the meantime, may I wish you all success in your prr�-
jected tour of New England.
 
sincerely,

Dear Mr. Fulehers
 
I have been considering the issues raised in wir te-

conversation of last week# and have also checked thus out
 
with one .
:r two of tkie Falk Arts pano ists.  The general
 
opinion s ous to be that the alterations you proposed in
 
yoar px.>Ject plans fall within the -atent of the original
 
grant # ^12473-78.
 
if there should be any major change in actual budgetary*
 
expenditures, I would, of course, need to be notifies.
 
Otherwise,, please accept this letter as auth.srization to pro-
ceed with your project along the lines of our conversation.

Hear Mr. Evans:
 
I am happy to hear that you will be visiting Washington in
 
February and would be most happy to meet with you.  Of the
 
dates you mentioned, February 7th would be preferable for me
 
during the afternoon, perhaps.
 I could also get in a visit
 
with you during the 8th at some point= I an scheduled to .
meet
 
with the Regional Representatives on that day, but no time
 
has I
m A beta set.  The 9th of February, I shall be at the
 
Council M
ing all days if we haven't connected before then,
 
I suppose we could foregather in the
y hall.  However, all in
 
all, February 7th do
ses seem preferable.
 
I am enclosing a copy of the rejection letter sent Roy Helms
 
at the Alaska State Arts Council in connection with application
 
A25097-78.  in case the xerox doesn't case out properly, the
 
notes scribbled on the bottom of the page says:
 "Barre Toelken,
 
our panel chairaan, hopes to talk with you about this during
 
his fortbcasing trip to Alaska n wt month.  The panel is hoping
 
for a resubmission."  I suppose the letter got misplaced during
 
the transition.  Barre toelken will be attending the Council
 
meeting on February 9.
 Please be sure to remind me to introduce
 
you twor I think a half hour with him would be extresely valuable
 
and I am sure he would be delighted to meet you and go over the
 
issues he and Rog discussed.
 
-a-
Lastly, I am enclosing a few copies of our Folk Arts brochures
 
and application blanks.  The 1984 guidelines will not be out
 
UAtil the summer, b#t our application deadlines continue the
 
Base -- I hope, through eternity -- January 1
, April 1
, July 1
 
(for emergency applications only)
 and October 1.  if you really
 
need a large supply of our 1979 brochures and/or application
 
forms, we can arragfe to have them shipped to you when you come
 
in February.
 
I'll look forward to seeing you then,

Los Angeles, CA  90012
 
Dear Wendy:
 
I am enclosing for your inspection an outline proposal that
 
reached me recently.  Although it is not exactly in the Folk
 
Arts line of country, since all the performances described
 
are clearly within the classical tradition, I would like to
 
do som
-t
ithing for Professor Susilo's proposed concert series.
 
She is tops in her field, and all her productions will be a
 
plus in duality, I am sure.
 
It occureddtbo a*, in worrying over this particular bone, that
 
if you are still working on the noon-time performance series
 
in the Civic Center, you might be interested in Dr. Susilo's
 
concerts -- at least some of them.  She also could use some
 
practical advice, it seems
, to me, about just how to further
 
her praise-worthy desire to perform off-campus.  Prow what she
 
says here, she doesn't quite know how to go about it.  It
 
would seem to me that some performances in city parks should
 
be possible.  Do you suppose you could put her in touch with
 
some sympathetic people in the city administration?  I think
 
it would be splendid to have some really top quality Asian
 
music and dance on display in Los Angeles community facilities.
 
I'm writing you on the assumption that you are still involved
 
in Los Angeles city affairs, if you've moved on to other
 
activities, could you possibly forward this note and enclosure
 
on to someone else who might be interested?  I wouldn't lay
 
this on you except that I do think Dr. Susilo's prograa is
 
worth some effort.  And I will continue
., by the way, to try*
 
to get some funding for her through the Endowmentx it just
 
would seem to me she would have a better chance if her plans
 
for off-campus performance were a bit more definite and clear.

I hope things have been going well for you since you left the
 
Rndow-ment.  Give me a call *=e tin* (person to person collect,
 
of course, 202/634-4282) and fill so in on the news.  warren
 
is back on our trail, by the wayt

Dear I
ts. Golden:
 
Thank you for your letter.  As you will sae from the Folk Arts
 
guidelines I have enclosed, your project of painting murals in
 
Santa Monica dons not fft the priorities of our particular
 
program.
 
I did, howe
t "r, enquire on your befalf in our visual Arts
 
section and spoke with a young w
oman named Pat Fuller there.
 
She reccsxaended that you think of one of two po►ssfbilitiess  a
 
residency fellowship or a planning grant though the arts in
 
public places program.  I as enclosing a copy of the visual
 
Arts guidelines for your uses both of these possibilities are
 
4
0escribed there in some detail.
 
I hope you will find these materials useful.  And, as an old
 
Santa Monica resident, may I send you my best wishes in your
 
search for funds?

Grants to Indian Tribes or Projects
 
Lynn Feingcala
 
The entire survey of Native AnOrican projects funded by
 
Folk Axt,s is simply to3 massive to xerox.  I have co®-
pxaaised by xeroxing the ta me of cintents which indicates
 
the data available, and section 41, which lists the grants
 
alphabetically under fiscal year inciading grantee organi-
sation, goegraphic location, culture gr:)up of artist(s)
 
(
in most cases, the tribal name of the Indiana involved)
 
and amount granted.
 
I am bringing this up to date on two addenda sheets.
 
Why don't you suggest to Liv that if Mr. Quinn wants
 
additional information as indicated on the table of con-
tents, he could get in touch with me directly?  Though
 
Exoansi.an Arts and Visual Arts, I kn w, have handled
 
grants to Indian tribes, I suspect we will Provo to be
 
d
;aing the most business with those folks.
 
you might also want to explain tw:a more things.  First,
 
that the funding agent  .
a often a university or a state
 
arts agency in cases where the applying group doesn't
 
have the first IR8 status.  Hvwmver, Folk Arts never
  
funds a pro)ect involving radian arts without letters of
 
interest and consent from th
is particular tribe
s involved
 
Secondly, Folk Arts has funded s weral projects in
 
Micronesia, as well as a number of multi-ethnic regional
 
festivals and similar events, many of which involve
 
Native Americans.  None of those shav
e up in this break-
d wn .

, as well

that you are -ntending to use traditional artists an
 
defined in our guidelines . our panal would need a sample
 
list of the artists you intend to feature on your concerts,
 
in order to determine whether or not the project would fit
 
into the genenal aims of our Program.
 
There is a technical point I should also mention to you.
 
Al mat all of our grants are w
,
, rked out on a 50-54 basis;
 
that is, you must ,
nut up 50% df  the actual costs of a pro-
ject and we can match that with another 50%.  You should
 
not be too alarmed by that ; you can match our funds at
 
least in part with so-called "soft" aaneay -- donation of
 
space, what your p.a  system
s would cost if you had to rent
 
it, support personnel salaries and the like.  If you are
 
confused ab:aut how to ind:.cate these daatations on the
 
application blank, our Grants Officer. Murtha Kueanh3ld
 
would be glad to help you and you can cal j her person -

It occurs to me in re-reading this that it night be helpful
 
for you to know that a member :
)f our advisory review panal
 
lives is Tennessee.  Perhaps a chat with hiss an the
, phone,
 
or a visit from him mould be helpful to you . His name is
 
Hill Iveyt he is Director of the Country Music Foundation,
 
and he can be reached at 615/256-1539 .  1 shall send him a
 
carbon copy of this letter, and he wi�l probably get in
 
touch with you to see if a visit would be helpful or
 
necessary.
 
I hppe the above information is useful .  If you have any
 
more t
auestions , I, or my associates Dan Sheehy and Sally

Dear Ds. Poulsen:
 
Thank you for y3ur letter.
 I am enclosing a copy :
af the Folk
 
Arts Program guidelines for your information.  As you will
 
see, it seems unlitsly that we can fund your prajected journal
 
of Utah folklore* since the general charge of the National
 
Arta Endowment is to support the production of art and
 
artistic activities, rather than sch
,-larship about the arts.
 
A letter to the s
earch Division of the National Endowment
 
for the 8umanities Might bs a useful step to take.  You could
 
write directly to Mr. Harold Ca
sa, Director of the Research
 
Division, 806-15th Street, N.W., Washington, D.0  20546.
 I
 
do not kn ot whether or not they fund activities such as
 
starting journalas however, their general reap:-t
nsibil
.ity is
 
to support scholarly activities in all the far-flung
 
h
 -man
 it
 ies f
 ie
 lds .
 
A final suggestion might be to talk to your Own Hal Carman,
 
Utah State Fine Arts Co m
eise i
on, 617 Bast South Temple Street,
 
Salt Lake City, Utah 84102 and see if he knows of any funding
 
possibility at the state level.
 
I am truly sorry the Folk Ants Program cannot be of assistance
 
to you in this particular case.  Please accept my best wishes
 
for the success of your new journal and, by the nay, please
 
pass along my Neu Years greeting to your colleague, ,
Tan
 
3runvand, should you happen to see him one of these days.
 
sincerely,
 
Sees Lomax Hawes
 
Director
