Attention: Dr. B. A. Botkin
Dear Mr. Alsberg:
The enclosed “Proposed Recording Expedition Into the Floridas” was written by Zora
Neale Hurston, Negro editor of the Florida Project.
I believe that Zora can assist the expedition in getting an excellent and original recordings
in the State. If possible, she should accompany the expedition on its trip through Florida,
as she has an intimate knowledge of folk song and folklore sources in the State.
Sincerely, Carita Doggett Corse Carita Doggett Corse State Director Federal Writers'
