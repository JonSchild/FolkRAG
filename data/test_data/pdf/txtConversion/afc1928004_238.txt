THE ADVENTURES OP A DRY-GOOD'S CLERK. 
SQUINTY DAN 
Charcoal Man." 
On, there was a 
young man lived in Harlem town, 
Vermicella was his maiden name; 
And he got tired of living a 
country life, 
And lie wasn't very much for to blame; 
So be emigrated down to this ere town, 
The fountain of all wealth, 
And be measured out tape in a 
dry-goods shop, 
Which wasn't very good for his health. 
Oh, be fell in love with a 
nice young dove, 
-Her name it was Johanna, 
And she wore a 
magnolius crinoline, 
And she punished the grand piano; 
And he took her to Coney Island on the ferry boat, 
And fed her on strawberries and cream; 
She was chief engineer of a 
millinery shop, 
And boss of a 
sewing machine. 
There was a 
photographic man lived opposite her house, 
Who tr:ed her cruel heart for to soften, 
And who won her young afnotions away, 
13y taldn , her pictures for nothing ; 
When tile dry- goods clerk came to hoar of this, 
Out of him it took the shine ; 
So he packed all his goods in a 
cigar box, 
And started up in Donaldson's balloon. 
u 
[BANJO SOLO.) 
ra tell you of a 
nice young man, 
And of a 
maiden gal ; 
The neighbors called him Squinty Dan, 
And she long-legged Sal. 
They lived down on Centre Street, 
And loved each other well ; 
And it's of a 
dismal history, 
That now I'm going to tell. 
Now Squinty Dan he had red hair, 
Awl looked two ways for Monday; 
He peddled clzuns around the street, 
On every day but Sunday. 
But Sundays Squinty Din would go 
To court long-legged Sal, 
And take her to ride in his clam-barouche 
On the banks of Go wanus canal. 
He used to feed her on clam-soup, 
Clam-cho‘vder, and clam- pie. 
And send her lots of long- necked clams, 
For her to roast and fry. 
Till the neighbors' gals, through jealousy, 
Male up a 
horrid plan 
To freeze the love in the bosom of 
Bet darling. Squinty Dan, 
When Squity Dan heard the news, 
11c climbed to :I chimiley-top; 
He pulled a 
pound of powder our, 
And down he let it drop. 
it flashed Op with a 
te.trful roar, 
And Wowed him so far on high ; 
He never came down—and that is the last 
Of this mournful his-to-ry.

Aut.—" Dry Dock Sal." 
OH, I 
Wiil sing you a 
song that's new, 
And a 
very funny song it is too ; 
Oh, it's all about the fashions you see every day, 
And when I 
am done you'll be very apt to say, 
What a 
very funny song that is. 
And I 
once went courting a 
gal, 
They called her long- nose Sal; 
She was freckled and she squinted, and her hair was red, 
And she looked like a 
weasel that wasn't half fed; 
Oh, what a 
funny gal that wat. 
011, the dandies you see now-a-days, 
They have such aristocratic ways; 
They wear their pantaloons so wide at the bottom, 
That it makes them look like a 
hog chewing cotton; 
Oh. what a 
funny style that is. 
And the ladies how funny they dress, 
Oh, they look like a 
ship in distress; 
For they wear a 
ball on their maintop gaff; 
And a 
thing banging down like a 
tail of a 
calf; 
Oh, what a 
funny style that is. 
Oh, the girls that I

They fill me with such delight, 
That my head is swimming round like a

And my heart goes pit-a-pat like a

Am.—" 
Road to Boston." 
On, myself and friends went out to ride in a 
gallus horse and

First we went to Tunison's, and then to Coney Island ;

With our two- forty on the road, the old horse a- going. 
Oh, Lor, gals, you ought to have seen us going 
Two-forty on the road, the old horse a-going. 
Oh, Lot., gals, etc. 
When we got out the wagon, we was met by the waiter; 
We called for roast beef, a

Then we got cigars, and went out doors to smoke them; 
Oh, didn't we have a 
jolly time a-going to Coney Island. 
Oh, Lor, gals, etc. 
Den we got some flip, which made us feel quite funny; 
And when we went to pay for it, we found we had no money; 
Dc landlord kicked up a 
muss, which set my blood a-biling, 
Den we had a 
kind o' fight a- going to Coney Island. 
Oh, Lor, gals, etc. 
Dey took us from de house, and dey put us in do station; 
Fined us each five dollars for our intoxication ; 
Oh, de landlord commenced do row, and I

When I

*Repeat. 
The day when first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal : 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never

The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a

That I

Written and sung by Master Lovrnocr. 
Aut.—"Pretty Little 31 ary." 
On, I 
once went a 
courting a 
very pretty girl, 
And they called her blue-eyed Mary; 
Oh, she looked at me so sly, with her coaxing soft blue eye, 
As she tended on the table in a 
dairy. 
Oh, ' twas on a 
summer's (lay, while travelling down Broadway, 
I 
stela into that cool refreshing dairy ; 
I 
called for milk and pie, when I 
met the roguish eye, 
And the fascinatin,g gaze of little Mary. 
Tier step was as light as a 
fairy, 
As she stepped around so nimble in that dairy; 
Oh, I'll ne'er forget that day, for she stole my heart away, 
And I 
could thlnk of nothing else but little Mary. 
To describe her many charms I 
ant not able, 
As she glided lihe a 
zephyr round the table; 
Oh, I 
felt so much at home, and I 
thought on her alone, 
While being waited on by blue-eyed Mary. 
judge of my surprise wi.en a 
ferow twice try size, 
And a 
styllsh air, came walking in that dairy ; 
Who she introduce] to me as her Lusband, (rye see, 
So I 
loa all hopes of wihulna litt:e Mary.

Written and sung by Master LovtLocz. 
AIr. .—Original. 
On, I'll sing you a 
song of a 
nice young girl, 
And he name was Mary Jane; 
She used to sit for hours and make artificial flowers, 
By which she a 
livelihood did gain, gain, gain, 
Which she a 
livelihood did gain. 
Now she fell in lose with a 
nice young man, 
And his name it was Zachariah Snooks, 
And he always used to stand in the Bowery close to Grand, 
A 
peddling of comical books, books, books, 
A 
peddling of comical books. 
So loudly be would cry, my comic books come buy, 
They will make a 
horse launli off his shoes ; 
You can burst your sides with lau;hter, and then forever after 
You will never feel the panic or the blues, blues, blues, 
You will never feel the panic or the blues. 
Now when it used to rain, he would visit Mary Jane, 
As lie couldn't then stand out with his books, 
For love had so turned his brain, and his heart was in such pain, 
That he fed upon sweet Mary Jane's looks, looks, looks, 
That be fed on sweet Mary Jane's looks. 
But true love's course it never does run smooth, 
And so it was with Snooks and Mary Jane ; 
For her iron-hearted father got her married to a 
barber, 
And Snooks hung himself to a 
sign board in the, rain, rain, 
rain, 
Oh, hp hung himself to,a sign board in the rain.

Ott, in New York city once aid reside, 
One who mi ,dit have lived yet if he hadn't of died ; 
No one knew where he used to lodge, 
For he always went on the saving dodge; 
His coat was once of the very best cloth, 
But now a 
restaurant for the moth; 
Any amount of cheese and crackers he'd munch, 
And he was a 
healthy boy at a 
hot free lunch.

In a

At blowing he'd stand and amuse you for hours, 
If you'd just warm him up with a 
few bourbon sours; 
He patronized every free lunch be was able, 
With his plate in his hand he was first at the table; 
On the Astor (louse steps he would then pick his teeth, 
And look with disdain at the people beneath. 
So crajity, crink, etc. 
One day he arrived at a 
lunch rather late, 
And in his excitement he swallowed the p'ate ; 
The people all stared to see such a 
mishap, 
And that was the last of this comical chap. 
Now all you who to free lunches constantl; go, 
And would wish on a

Just take my advice before it's too late, 
And when you've swallowed the lunch always hang on to the

ALARMING CATASTROPHE. 
As sung by Master LOVELOCK. 
Ant.—" Caroline of Edinburgh Town." 
OFI, good people, listen to my song, and I 
won't detain You long, 
It isn't a 
very short one, nor it isn't a 
very long; 
But when you have heard my story, I 
haven't any doubt 
That, I'll make you melancholy when you know what it's about. 
Oh, my father was a 
carpenter, but for that I'm not to blame, 
But when I 
think of mother dear, the tears they fail like rain; 
From G:eenland's icy mountains to the Gulf of Mexico, 
Blow your winds of morning, blow your winds I 
ho. 
Oh, across the raging deep blue sea, against the rock-bound 
shore, 
Where many a 
gallant, ship was lost, and the splashing waves do 
roar; 
The Indian girl upon the lakes, she paddles her own canoe, 
With her Indian rubber overcoat, a 
hoop de doodle do. 
At the foot of yonder mountain there flows a 
gentle stream, 
Midst the fairest of fairie3 that ever yet was seen ; 
Young Mary laid lie: down to rest, and loudly she did shout, 
Good morning, Mr. Jenkins, does your mother know you're out ? 
Now Henry was far out to sea, as you may understand, 
lie took his pocket- 11m lkerchief and waved it in his hand, 
The gallant ship she sprung- a 
leak, and went three times around, 
And sunk into the deep blue sea, and never has been found. 
Now my friends take wining, by this fila an:I doleful tale, 
And never leave your bumble cot across the seas to La :I, 
But think of the fate of Hen-ri-ce, who from his love did fly, 
Like a 
big pig, a 
little pig, a 
root hog or die.

SAL BRILL AND SQUINTING WILL. 
A SIMPLE LITTLE DITTY. 
Atn.—" The Girl I 
Left Behind Me." 
I 
LOVED a 
gal called Pretty Sal, 
In courtship so particular— 
Just three feet high, she'd but one eye, 
Her breath was like the auricula. ' 
Her flaxen pate and waddling gait 
Did seem so like divinity— 
So sweet her leer, I 
cried, " Oh, dear, 
IIl love you for infinity !" 
I 
sent her word, on a 
fine card, 
With figures emblamatical, 
That I 
would come and take her home— 
In that I 
was dogmatical ! 
But she said, " No ! if I 
said so 
From now to all infinity, 
That I 
should find it was her mind 
With me to have no affinity !" 
One day, oh dear! as you shall hear, 
By my own incongruity, 
I 
met Sal Drill with Squinting Will, 
In closest contiguity. 
Oh, then she said, " Gwoot Will I'll wed, 
To end all ambiguity ; 
011aby, good-by! you're ' al ny qw—, 
live in continuity.' 
PRETTY GAL IN BLUE. 
I 
ONCE did bib a 
yaller gal, her name I 
do not know, 
I

She wears a 
white lace handkerchief, 
It's marked with eye and you. 
I'll know her if I 
see her, 
Ease she's always dressed in blue. 
She's set dis darkey crazy, 
I 
don't know what to do, 
If I 
could find dat pretty yaller gal 
Dat I 
saw dressed in blue. 
I 
met her in de street one day, 
She looked at me so sly, 
And when de hosses '!,in to jump, 
Dey both begin to shy. 
They jumped, they pitched, they reared, they went, 
And down de street dey flew, 
And passed dat pretty yaller gal 
Dat I 
saw dressed in blue. 
She set dis darkey, etc. 
If I 
could find her name, 
And where she does belong, 
I'll write by telegraph 
Da verses ob my song; 
But if I 
do not find her, 
My heart will heat and woo, 
Then ru sigh, and bid good-bye, 
To dat pretty yallor gal dressed in blue.

To bother deir heads about do nigger; 
First Boblition comes to view, 
And den Secession, too; 
And di s 
fight is all about de nigger. 
You may talk and you may write, 
You may work and you may fight, 
But what good does cher arise 7 
You may paint and you may rub, 
You may wash and you may scrub, 
But a 
nigger is a 
nigg,cr till he dies! 
But just list to me, etc. 
Now, white folks, in a 
trice, 
I'll gib you some advice: 
Don't get mad because it comes from a 
moke: 
Let de Norf and de Souf 
Both shut up deir ruouf, 
And den you will hit do right stroke. 
Let Abolition die, 
And Secession keep shy, 
And de Non f 
and de Souf shake hands; 
And now, white folks, hear me : 
Just leave de niguer be; 
For, I 
tell you dey isn't worth a 
cent. 
But just list to me, etc.

As Pat Roach arid the Missus, from Galway, 
In Dublin once happened to be, 
To the playhouse they went one fine evening, 
Determined diversion to see. 
But, says Pat as he entered, " there's no one." 
"Pay here !" cried a 
voice. " Holy murther 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
"Pay here:" cries a 
voice. " Holy murther 1" 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
The missus she looked all around her, 
In wonder her eyed they did roll, 
" 
But," says she, " Paddy, darling, alanna, 
lie is hero Eke a 
rat in a 
hole ; 
"Pay here, how much is it ?" " a 
shilling." 
" 
A 
shillinq apiece ; that won't do; 
'Tis too mach, Mister Pay here avourneen, 
Eil-diteen pince, I 
will give you for two ; 
'Tis too much, Mister Pay here avourneen, 
Eighteen pince, I 
will give you for two.' 
Pat crumbled, but paid and rrot seated, 
The hand was be:inning to play ; 
tie :fel on his scat quite ciaied, 
And to the inwilc:ans did say : 
"'T:s ye: celve.-; that can do it, me bouchals,

PAT ROACH AT THE PLAY.—Continuod. 
To the fiddlers more power to your elbows, 
Mister bugler,11.;av'n spdre ye, yer wind, 
To the fiddlers 1110re power to your elbows, 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, yer wind." 
The play then went on, and Pat wondered, 
And sat with li!s mouth open wide, 
As the proud haughty Lord of the Manor 
Sought to make the fair maiden his bride; 
" 
To the mountains," says he, " I 
will bear thee." 
She shrieked as she saw him approach : 
" 
Is there no one at hand now to save me'?" 
Shouts a 
voice : " yis, me darlin', Pat Roach." 
Then up on the scat jumped brave Paddy, 
Says lie: " now ; you blackguard, be gone, 
Or a 
lord thou411 you be tin times over, 
Pa knock your two eyes into one." 
" 
Sit down there in front !" " What, you spalpeen, 
Is it me you thus dare to addriss? 
Do ye think that Pat Roach would sit aisy, 
And see that poor girl in distriss 
A 
scuffle ensued in a 
minute. 
But soon sure the row did subside ; 
And, as Pat gasped for breath, he discovered 
Of the door he was on the Ivrori 
side; 
He soon four,d the missus, next morning 
They started for home, and Pat swore 
If he once safely landed in Galway, 
He'd come up to Dublin no more.

BIDDY NODDY. 
Written amd sung by Master LovELomt. 
Am.—" Off She Goes." 
I WAS born up stairs on the third floor back, 
Without a 
stitch of a 
shirt or a 
rag to my back; 
So I 
suppose I 
must have been born very young, 
And my nose must be just the same age as my tongue. 
Oh, the girls they used to dance me up, 
But I've got so fat they've given that up, 
And they used to put me so nicely to bed, 
But now I've to crawl in myself instead. 
CHOI:US. 
Umpty Dumpty, cook a 
to coo, 
There was an old woman she lived in a 
shoe, 
Old daddy long- legs and little boy blue, 
Oh, cock a 
doodle, doodle doo. 
One day to exercise my legs, 
They sent me out to buy some eggs; 
But I 
thought they might fool me and give me none, 
So I 
sucked them all before I 
got home; 
Then my mother spanke I 
me with her shoe, 
And my parpar walloped me black and blue, 
But I 
played off sick and cut up such freaks, 
That they let me stay home from school for six weeks. 
Umpty Dumpty, etc.

NIDDY NODDY.—Continued. 
But now I'm grown a 
bigger boy, 
And the girls all call me a 
hobety boy, 
Tho' I 
don't mind that because, d'ye see, 
For they're all fighting to get the first kiss at me. 
Now turn about's fair play you know, 
So of course I 
give them all a 
show; 
But if they don't take one another's lives, 
I 
shall surely have to marry 506 wives. 
Umpty Dumpty, etc. 
My parents want to secure me a 
position 
In Barnum's Wax Work Exhibition, 
But I'd rather not go, for the boys would be sure 
To shout and make faces at me at the door. 
And the girls would come in with a 
rush, 
And do stunts with their eyes to make me blush; 
Oh, they make me feel funny, and play off such jokes, 
And perhaps crowd round and kiss me before all the folks. 
Umpty Dumpty, etc. 
Now I'll let them know they can't fool me, 
For I'll run away and I'll go to sea, 
And if I 
don't make my mark very soon, 
I'll go up with Mr. What's-
his-name in his balloon, 
For determined I 
am that my name shall be 
Handed down with renown to posterity; 
So if I 
don't fall into some big fish's jaw, 
I'll come back and tell you all that I 
saw.

Sung by BILLY W EST. 
Oh how many times must I 
expressly desire you to communicate 
to me, Mollie Darling, 
That you never placed your affections on any other snoozer in the 
world but me. 
For I

supplicating attitude, Mary A 
in O'Shaugh-
nessy, darling, 
You are all the world and the biggest part of New Jersey to me. 
Oh just squeal out once that you feel an ardent, attachment for me, 
Put that delicate paw of yours, that looks like au elephant's ear, 
in this hand of mine 
You can have entire possession of my gizzard, sweet candy de.

If you are fond of policy and want a 
gig for the remainder of 
your existence, 
Inform your humble servant by allowing hint the exta tic bliss of 
pressing those lips that look like a 
slice cut out of a 
sugar

I 
am reluctantly compelled to take my departure, Mollie Darling. 
I've got to buy some buttons for the keno tablt S, Rml I'd rather 
lose a 
stack of five cent chips than leave 3 
on thus. 
But when the lamps are lit in the clouds, and the cop is at the other 
end of the block, love, 
I'll whistle llam Pat, and son come and meet me at the gate and 
we'll breathe our flat iron tales of love. 
So—over the river— so long— good bye, you box of blacking. 
May you never have any desire to apply for a 
divorce, 
So retire to your roost and if you dream of any numbers, Mollie 
Darling, 
Morin me in the morning, and I'll play ' cin in a 
gig for two cents.

PITY PETER POPFYTOP.-1-CoxcLuDED.] 
In youth I 
tasted every sham, 
The oil they call the " Castor," 
The powder placed in currant jam, 
The lively mustard plaster; 
Full often I 
with mouth awry 
Brimstone and treacle swallowed, 
I 
daren't complain for then the cane 
And salts and senua followed. 
SPOKEN.—Every body was down on me then, it's very hard-
C110.—Oh 1 
people, etc. 
My thrashings still make me turn pale, 
'Whenever they are mentioned, 
('Twas something very like a 
weal 
To call them well intentioned) ; 
And through a 
lapse of many years 
I 
still can recollect who 
Threw snowballs into both my ears 
Which trickled down my neck too. 
SPOICEN.—Every body was down on Peter, it's very hard— 
Cno.—Oh I 
people, dre. 
I 
thought some money might be made 
By selling silk umbrellas, 
So bought an " old established" trade 
Of two good-natured fellows; 
I 
couldn't make the business pay, 
There never was such weather, 
We didn't get a 
rainy day 
For quite six months together. 
SPOKEN.—Every body was down on me but the rain, that 
wouldn't come down; it's very hard— 
Cno.—Oh I 
people, dre. 
My fortune in the betting ring 
Was like my other ventures, 
I 
nearly squandered every thing 
In some railway debentures. 
My courting, too, turned out a 
do, 
For Sue, my love deriding, 
Got married to a 
fellow who 
Gave me a 
dreadful hiding. 
SPOKEN.—Every body's down on me, it's very hard— 
Cllo.—Oh! people, &c.

While they hang their heads in shame, 
They are modest, Mollie darling,

Oh! Mollie, darling, the anchor is weighed, 
The s!dp is now ready to sail o'er the sea, 
Each moment is precious and time will not wait, 
Oh! Mollie my treasure do listen to me; 
You're going far away from kindred and friends, 
Oil to the laud that is far o'er the foam, 
We've no one but you to gladden our hearts— 
Don't leave us, Mollie, sweet light of our home. 
CHORUS. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, and leave us alone, 
For dreary our beautiful home then will be. 
We've no one to care for but you, Mollie dear, 
Don't leave us, darling. Oh I 
listen to me. 
! 
Mollie, my darling, your father is ill, 
But still he has come down to see you depart. 
He stands by your side in our sorrow and pain, 
And tears tell the anguish that lies in his heart, 
Oh! come to my arms, let me fold you again, 
Close to the heart that is throbbing for thee, 
Remember the days when I 
sang you to sleep, 
Don't leave us, Mollie, to cross the blue sea. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, ete. 
Oh! Mollie, my darling, say what will you do, 
Alone in a 
land were but strangers abide, 
No kind words you'll hear ot advice, M2e134e dear, 
But ah ! many evils will lurk at your side; 
Let me kiss you, perhaps for the last time on earth, 
For we are old, and our days are but few, 
There's tears in your eyes, I 
see you'll not go— 
Heav'n pour sweet blessings, dear Mollie, on you.. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, 8Go.

NY POLLY ANN. 
At the fancy ball, the other night, 
My Polly Ann and me, 
Were dressed to death in all our best, 
So happy, light and free! 
When Pompey Smash a 
colored rnoak, 
Came rushing in the hall, 
And swore that none should dance with Poll. 
There at the fancy ball. 
CHORUS. 
Now strike up the fiddle, and let the banjo ring, 
Then join in the chorus, while merrily we sing; 
Let darkies quarrel, and emigrate to France, 
I'm a 
happy darkie, oh 
with this breakdown deg.... 
My Polly Ann, she looked at me, 
And. then she gave a 
sigh, 
While Pompey Smash he shook his fist, 
With vengeance in his eye; 
I 
kissed my hand to Polly Ann, 
The leader gave a 
call; 
Away went Pomp with Polly Ann, 
The gayest of them all. 
Now, strike up, &a. 
Soon Pomp and Poll were married, 
Pomp cleaned the gemmen's clothes, 
And Polly shouted: Hot corn! where , 
The Summer breezes blows; 
But now they have retired, 
And you'll see them here no more, 
Cause Pompey's made his fortune, 
And has gone to Baltimore. 
Now. strike up, Aft

LAWLOR at Mr. CHAS. MAcEvov's Original 
Hibernicon. 
Air :—" Kate Kearney." 
Oh ! have you not heard of McCarty, 
Who lived in Tralee, good and hearty I 
He had scarce lived two score, when deah came to his door. 
And made a 
widdy of Mrs. McCarty. 
Near by, lived one Paddy Mc Manus, 
Who, by the way, was a 
bit of a 
Genius: 
At his trade he was good: Cuttin' figures of wood. 
Says he ; I'll go see the Widdy McCarty. 
Now Paddy, you know, was no ninny; 
Ile agreed for a 
couple of guineas, 
To cut out a 
stick, the dead image of Mick 
And take it home to Widdy McCarty. 
As the Widdy she'd sit by the fire, 
Every night, before she'd retire, 
She'd take the stick that was dead put it into the bed, 
And lay down by the wooden McCarty.

That the Widdy was wanting a

And under the bed shoved the wooden McCarty.

OLD FOLKS AT HOME. 
Way down upon the Swanee ribber, 
Far, far away, 
Dare's wha my heart is turning ebber, 
Dere's wha de old folks stay. 
All up and down de who e creation, 
Sadly I 
roam; 
Still longing for de old plantation, 
And for de old folks at home. 
CHORUS. 
All de world am sad and dreary, 
Ebry where I 
roam; 
Oh I 
darkeys, how my heart grows wee 
Far from de old folks at home. 
All around de little farm I 
wandered, 
When I 
was young; 
Den many happy days I 
squandered, 
Many de songs I 
sung. 
When I 
was playing wid my brudder, 
Happy was I; 
Oh i 
take me to my kind old mudder, 
Dere let me live and die. 
All de world, &e. 
One little hut among de bushes, 
One dat I 
love ; 
Still sadly to my memory rushes, 
No matter where I 
rove. 
When will I 
see de bees a 
humming, 
All round de comb ? 
When will I 
hear de banjo tumming, 
Down iia my good home. 
All de worli, &a.

It's not my fault I'm timid, and all rough companions dread, 
I 
cannot smoke, it makes me ill! and wine gets in my head. 
The op'ra, concert, ball, or play, possess no charm for me, 
I 
much prefer waxwork, or a 
friendly cup of tea. 
But best of all, I 
like the Park, for, oh! it is such fun 
To feed the pretty little ducks with little bits of bun. 
I 
often notice people smile, which makes me blush, but, then, 
I'm not the same, &c. 
I 
ne'er can hope to marry, and my heart it sorely tries; 
I 
don't know how to ask them, and girls don't care for sighs; 
And if I 
wrote my feelings down, and left them at the door, 
I 
should be too ashamed to meet the lady any more. 
But to the altar if I 
went, so great would be my dread, 
That, when I 
had to give the ring, my knees would knock instead, 
It's very funny, is it not? to feel like this, but, then, 
I'm not the same, &c.

SARAH BELL. 
I 
once did lub a 
yaller gal, 
And I 
know dat she lubbed me, 
But such a 
bright-eyed yeller gal, 
I 
never yet did see ; 
But she has proved inconstant, 
And left me here to tell, 
The sorrows dat my heart do feel 
For deceitful Sarah Bell. 
CHORUS. 
Cheer up, Sam, 
And don't let your spirits go down, 
Dere's many a 
belle 
Dat I 
know yell, 
Is looking for you in the town. 
I 
had no gold to give her, 
And all I 
had I 
gave, 
For wealth or riches don't belong 
To one (let's born a 
slave. 
The white man come and took her, 
She went with him to dwell, 
And broke the vows and promises, 
Of perjured Sarah Bell. 
Cheer up, Sam. dm 
One day as I 
was w„trkIng, 
And hoeing down the corn, 
I 
sighed and wished within me, 
I 
neber had been born. 
Perhaps she's gay and happy, 
Whereber she may dwell, 
While dis poor heart lies breaking, 
For de loss of Sarah Bell. 
Cheer up, Sam, (ic. 
FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS. 
I 
miss them now, those little feet, 
That used to come so oft, 
The little voice that used to speak, 
So sweet, so silvery soft; 
And now when I 
am all alone, 
Engrossed in daily cares, 
I 
listen but 'tis all in vain 
For the footweps on the stairs. 
For when I 
read, or sing or play, 
Or join in pleasures sweet, 
I 
seem to see her glad and gay, 
And miss those little feet ; 
Oh; it is hard to think she's gone, 
With all her winning airs, 
To think I 
never more & tall hear, 
Her " Footsteps on the stairs." 
Her golden curls still cluster round, 
Her brow so white and clear, 
And on her face, now white and cold, 
I've shei full many a 
tear, 
The lids have drooped o'er those blue cyst, 
Death's icy seal is theirs ; 
'Tis he that has forever hushed, 
Those " Foptsteps on the stairs." 
I 
know her feet are walking now, 
The shining streets of heaven ; 
know that to that dear one's brow, 
A golden crown is given. 
I'm thankful that she is at rest, 
Safe from earth's sinful snares, 
Yet still T 
weep and pause to hear, 
The " Footsteps on the stake'

HAPPY JERSEY JOE. 
Written and sung by Master LOVELOCK. 
Ain," The Days We went a Gipt,eying." 
On, you've often heard of Jersey Sam, 
A 
jolly chap like me, 
We've been together oftentimes, 
On many a 
jovial spree ; 
In our youthful days we schoolmates were, 
And now old, we still are friends; 
At any time if short of cash, 
Each to the other lends. 
CHORUS. 
So merrily I 
pass my days, 
And I'd have you all to know, 
I'm known by all around the town, 
As Happy Jersey Joe. 
So merrily, etc. 
Though not exactly a 
farming man, 
1 
labor for my bread, 
And in my youth I 
have nobly 
For my country fought and bled ; 
So merrily down the bill of life 
I'm now resolved to go, 
So cheer up there, begono dull care, 
Make way for Jersey Joe. 
So merrily I 
pass, etc.

HAPPY JERSEY JOE.—Continued. 
Some say this world is a 
world of woe, 
And pull a 
lengthened facg, 
Yes, if you like to make It so, 
You can suit it to your taste; 
But cheer your heart up, always drive 
Dull care to Jericho ; 
Meet troubles half way, I 
guess not, 
That wouldn't suit Old Joe. 
So merrily I 
pass, etc. 
What makes me feel so happy man, 
And brimful with delight, 
Is to see so many ladies' 
Smiling faces here to-night; 
They are doing stunts now with their eyes; 
It's too bad to tease me so; 
I 
could jump for joy, I'm a 
gay old boy, 
You can bet your boots on Joe. 
So merrily, etc , 
Oh, dear, it always brings to mind 
The days when I 
was young; 
To see the coaxing, laughing eyes, 
And to hear their merry tongue. 
One word, kind friends, before we part, 
Farewell, for I 
must go; 
May you always feel as happy 
As your old friend Jersey Joe. 
So merrily, etc.

JERSEY SAX. 
Oh! I 
was born in Jersey, 
And of that I'm going to sing; 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wing. 
I 
went way down to New Orleans, 
And there I 
fought the foe, 
Along with Hickory Jackson, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am one of the olden time, 
And may be thought too gay, 
But I'm Jersey Sam, the Fartuer's man, 
Hurrah! hurrah 
hurrah! 
I 
bear the name of Samuel, 
Though some, they call me Sam, 
And through this world I 
rove along, 
As happy as I 
can; 
The world, they say, has been improved 
But I 
should like to know, 
If folks are any better now, 
Than Fifty Years ago. 
For i 
am one, & e. 
When I 
was young, then boys were boys, 
And went to bed at ten; 
But now, when they are twelve years old, 
They think that they are men. 
You'll hear them call for rum and beer, 
And smoke cigars, heigh-ho! 
What would our parents have thought of that 
Sot ,e 
Fifty Years ago I 
For I 
am one, &c. 
At midnight, too, one hears yonng men, 
With husky voices sine, 
That " Champagne Charlie" is their name, 
And they know it's no such thing; 
They go to bed with a 
head-ache, 
At least they tell us so, 
I 
never heard of such a 
thing, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am ane, tice 
The women of the present time, 
They cannot draw a 
line; 
But wear our hats and jackets, 
And appear quite masculine ; 
They wear false hair, for it's th style, 
And call it their own; you know— 
But our girls would scorn to wear a 
wig,

THE POOR OLD SIAAVII. 
'Ts just one year ago to-day, 
That I 
remember well, 
sat down by poor Nelly's side 
A 
story she did tell; 
'Twas about a 
poor unhappy slave 
That lived for many a 
year, 
Alit now he's dead and in his grave, 
No master does he fear. 
CHORUS. 
The poor old slave has gone to reek 
We know that he is free, 
Disturb him not, but let him rest 
Way down in Tennps,ssq,. 
She took lily arm, we walked along 
Into an open field, 
Ad 
she paused to breathe awhile, 
Then to his grave did steal. 
She sat down by that little mound, 
And softly whispered there, 
Come to me, father, 'tis thy child, 
Then gently dropped a 
teas:. 
The poor old slave, 
But since that time how things have changed, 
Poor Nelly that was my bride, 
Xs laid beneath the cold grave sod, 
With her father by her side. 
X 
planted there upon her grave, 
The weeping willow tree, 
T. bathed its roots with many a 
tear 
That it might shelter me. 
The poor old slate. lbw

PARTING CHORUS, 
AIR—Drinking Chorus, LUCRETIA BORGIA. 
Oh ! the hearts that we love, boys, are beating, 
While to-day our fierce foemen we're meeting; 
But the eyes that we prize for their splendor, 
Will glisten more bright and more terder. 
CHORUS. 
When with lanrels encrowned on the morrow, 
And with victory swelling each breast, 
We return to dispel every sorrow, 
F-om the hearts that we all love the best. 
Bnt our country to-day, boys, is nearest, 
And the flag of our Union is dearest; 
For we fight for our fond ones, God bless them, 
That with honor we still may caress them ! 
Then with laurels encrowned, Joe. 
THE PEANUT GIRL. 
Now gather round me, colored folks, and listen to my ditty, 
It's all about a 
lubly gal, she libed in dis great city ; 
Oh ! she libed wid her mudder up seven pair 
Ob stairs, in de Bowery street, near Grand, 
But her business place was on Broadway, 
Where she kept it peanut stand. 
There was a 
young policeman smiled on her, 
And he bought her peanuts too, 
And she fell in lub wid his German silver star, 
And his lubly coat oh blue. 
Dey lobed each oder like de Shanghai 
Fowls dat walk about in spring, 
And he took her up to Jones' wood, 
To hear de Dutchmen sing. 
She vowed she'd lub him ebermore, 
And ne'er from hint would stray ; 
But she shook him and left wid an organ 
Grinder, de boys call him old dog Tray. 
Dey gib curb stone concerts on rainy days, 
Which hab given de young gal a 
bad cough; 
And de jealous young policeman in revenge, 
When he sees dent, he hollers: Walk offl 
NANCY TILL. 
Down by the canebrake, 
Close by de mill, 
Dere I 
met a yaller gal, 
And her name was Nancy Till; 
She know'd dat I 
loved her, 
She know'd it berry long, 
I'm going to serenade her, 
An' dis shall be de song.

Oh come love, come, de boat lies low, 
She lies high and dry on de Ohio! 
Come, love, come, won't you go 'long wid met 
I'll take you down to Tennessee.

Will you go, lub, wid me? 
I

While de boat rows me; 
And I'm waiting for you now, 
You will not refuse to go, 
And listen to de harmony 
Ob de ole banjo.

Open de window, lub, 
For your lover so true.

Lt may truly be said that since its publication,

Those write now who never wrote before, 
And those who always wrote, now write the more."
