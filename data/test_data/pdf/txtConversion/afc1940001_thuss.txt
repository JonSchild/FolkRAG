Thus Spake the Ancient Gull
I'm a grafter bold as stows my hold With things what come my way, and I laugh, "Yo, ho!" as I chucks
below The graft from 'Frisco Bay.
There was once a time in foreign clime I anchors to them piles And I sees all hands they understands
By the way they kind o' smiles.
So we trails them craft and we works the graft And we fills our hulls each day With various freight
and pieces o' light What they heaves into the bay.
But most we gloat when a ferryboat Starts out with a picnic crowd, With pie and cake along with her
wake Yo, ho,! but we laughs some loud!
Then I seeks a pile and I rest awhile And I sort o' reefs my wings, And I stretches a leg just to rest that
peg And then I ups and sings:
"I'm a grafter bold as stows my hold With things what come my way, and I laugh, "Yo, ho!" as I chucks
below The graft from 'Frisco Bay."
