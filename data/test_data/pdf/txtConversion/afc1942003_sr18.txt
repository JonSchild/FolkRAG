Mrs. Jeb Wagoner: This is Mrs. Jeb Wagoner of Elon College, North Carolina speaking. I feel like that
we're just as much in the war now as the men are. And it's up to the women of North Carolina, as
well as the United States, to do everything in our power to help win this war. We'll all have boys to
go out there and fight, and it's up to us to see that they are furnished everything they need to fight
with, and to eat, and everything else that goes with it. And I don't know what the rest of the women
around here think about it, but that's my opinion. And so we'll fight to the end, till we're finished with
the Japs, Germans, and Italians, as well all the other people that's trying to take the freedom away
from the American people.
Luther Wagoner: This is Luther Wagoner speaking from Elon, North Carolina, Box 274. I work in a
horseshoe mill, and we live on a salary of about twenty-five dollars a month, a week. I don't know
what I'll do when the war gets to where that we don't have any work. [long pause] I was talking to
my wife the other day and [in general (?)] we was talking about what work we would have after the
horseshoe mill shut down, and possibly I might have to go off somewhere to get to another job.
Don't know what we'll do.

J. T. Wagoner: It's J. T. Wagoner, Burlington, Route 4. I want to express my opinion and feeling toward
the national government and their affairs. I feel that we can do something to help to carry on, to win
the war. And we going to win it. Everything that we can do â€” me, my family, my neighbors to win the
war, we're going to do it. We're going to do it in a short while. We've got to do it to save our country.
We have got so much tending at home that we let this war be won by the other countries we have
got nothing. We have lost everything. Our religion means much here at home. And we can't afford
to lose in this struggle that we have here before us. So let us all band together and do something,
everything that can be done to win this war. And when they wind up we'll have something to be
proud of.
