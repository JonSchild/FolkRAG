TAPE BEGINS WITH INFORMANT CLEARING THROAT
M:  Hmm.  Good response.
J:  Was it good?  How about now?  No?  [M:  It is moving a little bit.]  Sprake into the English.  
Nine.  Spraking the bow wow?  Yeah, ruff, ruff.  Go ahead.  What do you want to ask me?
M:  Uh, let's just talk about the Holy Water.  Yeah, what happened here this morning.
J:  What do you mean?  [M:  With the food.] You mean lunch today that you offered us?  [M:  
Yeah.  All I know is that the last time I came, there was more Chanting, you know.]  Yeah.  [M:  
Was that a special thing for the Lowish(?) and Munks?]  No.  The last time you came somebody 
wanted to have like a little, uh, memorial for their ancestors that past away already.  [M:  Oh, 
okay.]  All we did today was the normal blessing to not thank the people but to recite why it is 
good for them to feed us.  [M:  That was after the meal.]  Yeah.  [M:  Before there was something
before the meal, right.]  No, not today, no.  [M:  No I meant the last time I was here.]  Yeah.  
Usually before there is nothing before the meal.  Sometimes we chant before the meal but 
usually with [UNCLEAR] always chants after the meal.  And they chant back to us.  [M:  I 
noticed, yeah.]  Thank you for letting us make this good comma together.  [M:  So you can 
translate the chants?]  Yeah, most of them.  Most of them I have in English.  [M:  Uh hmm.]  
M:  So what does it translate into?
J:  Do you want me to chant today's one?  [M:  Yeah.]
M:  I mean do you chant the same one every day?  [J:  Every time we get offered something, 
anything.]  Yeah.  [J:  Like when you came with the food today I should have done that but I did 
it after lunch today.]  
M:  So whenever you are offered something (--) [J:  Yeah, we have to chant this.]
J: "Just as the rivers full of water fill the ocean full.  Even so does that here give and benefit the 
dead.  Whatever by you wished or wanted may it quickly be.  May all your wishes fulfilled as the
moon upon the 15th day or as the wishful filling gem.  Uh, may all this stress be averted.  May 
all disease be destroyed and may no dangers come to you.  May you be happy, living long, and 
be of respectful nature and honor your elders.  Four qualities will increase in you.  Long life, 
beauty, happiness, and strength."  That's what we chant after every meal.  The first part is 
chanted by [READ IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGE]  And that's it. 
M:  And in what language is that in?  [J:  Bolly(?).  This is the original Buddhist Religious 
Language.  It's (--) Some people call it street transcript.]  But it is still understood by even the 
people that come to the temple.  
J:  Yeah, a lot of people understand some of the words, but not all of the words.  Because it's not 
really a speaking language.  It's more like a memorable one.  [M:  It would be like Latin.]  It's 
like Latin.  It's like a language from memorization and for scholar.  [M:  Yeah.]  Scholar Leaders 
(--).  It's not a very popular language anymore.  Not many people study it.  Only Munks basically
and a few college and scholars, language scholars.  It is the root of the Cambodian, Tye(?) and 
Louwe(?) though.  [M:  But the transcript is the root of all the European Languages too.] This is 
like the street version transcript.  Mike, want some coffee buddy?  [M:  Sure.  So would you be 
able to understand a Buddhist ceremony, you know, chanted?  In any other sect or other part of 
the world?]  They use the same formula's.  [M:  Okay.]  All Budhism was based on four things.  
The first noble truth is suffering, okay.  The second one is, uh, rising of suffering.  The third one 
is the sensation of suffering.  The fourth one is a path or a way to end suffering.  All Budhism is 
based on that.  Every country.  If it is not based on that, it's not Budhism.  Simple, you know.  
The teaching revolves all from those four things.  That is why they call it the Four Noble Truths. 
[M:  Why does everybody center on suffering?] What isn't?  Doesn't mean that you have to be 
attached to it and feel negative about it but what isn't suffering in this world?  Nothing.  Every 
thing is impermanent.  There's not one thing you can tell that is stable in this world.  Nothing.  
Think about it.  
M:  Well everything is always changing.  [J:  Yeah.]  Nothing stays the same.  
J:  I know, so you can't hold on to anything.  When you hold on to things that's when you get 
suffering.  When we think we are things that we are not, you get suffering.  Do you know what I 
mean?  Like when we think we are [UNCLEAR] we are our bodies, we are our minds.  [M:  Uh 
hmm.]  What's up tiger?  Where are you going?  Huh?  What?  Are you going to bed?  [O:  Yeah.]
Yeah.  
M:  She's making progress.  Pretty soon she is going to understand all the things she is saying.  
J:  She's good.  She wouldn't get mad.  She always takes care of me.  She gave me a refrigerator, 
you know, cause one day somebody gave me some juice and the next day she saw me drinking it 
and it was hot.  She said to her son "I will give him some money"  and made him buy me a 
refrigerator to put in my room.  [M:  That small refrigerator?]  Yeah.  [M:  That's nice.]  When I 
went to New York she gave me $50.  Because she has arthritis, obviously.  And I use to treat her. 
Get rid of the pay for two days and it would come back.  She is old (--)  [M:  How would you 
treat her?] [UNCLEAR]  and medicines.  I don't treat her anymore.  She is too old, too sensitive. 
[M:  Really?]  Yeah, my needles are too small and too much energy in them.  I am not suppose to
touch woman so I can't massage her. [M:  How about just medicine?]  She takes too much 
medication for her heart, and I don't want to complicate the medicine.  [M:  Oh, so she is going 
to a western doctor?] Yeah.  [M:  Where do you have to go, downstairs?]  No, right here.  [M:  
Oh.]  I'm just putting my shoes on.  
M:  How about when you guys go outside?
J:  I wear these.  
J:  Do you have any tapes of you playing the guitar?
M:  Uh ah.  Oh yeah I do.  [J:  Oh do you?  Bring them by.  Let me here it sometime.]  I have an 
old open real made a long time ago.  You will have to dub it on a cassette.  Oh yeah, we were 
going to talk about the string and all that.  
J:  What happened to [UNCLEAR]   [M:  I don't know.]  The best thing to do is bring all your 
stuff in with you and once you get him talking just flip it on.  He's hard to make him sit down 
and (--)  [M:  Somebody recorded an interview with him.]  Oh, really?  [M:  Somebody who is 
working on this project last summer.]  
M:  I can tell you when I get back.   I have it in my other bag.  
J:  I am going to take five.  [M:  I took four.]  Take them before you go to bed tonight.  [M:  So 
what is this called?]  Yungell(?). [NO POISON SAID IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGE]  No 
poison.  [M:  No poison.]  I give this to babies.  This works unbelievable for conjuctivitis, ear 
problems.  [M:  Hmm.  But a lot of people practice Chinese Medicine?]  No.  [M:  Just you.]  
Sucoon(?) is a good doctor, an herbal doctor.  He has no supplies though.  [M:  Yeah.]  He is 
stranded because he has the ability but he doesn't have the supplies.  [M:  Yeah, but plants don't 
grow here.] Hmm.  [M:  I asked if the market, if he imported or sold any of the herbs that they 
use for medicine.  He said no.]  You mean Joe?  [M:  Yeah, Joe.  I don't think he can get them.]  
He can get them.  [M:  I don't think he wants to get into then.]  Probably not, because you need 
somebody who knows how to do that stuff.  [M:  Well where can you get them, Boston?]  China 
Town.  Most grocery stores have a drug store.  [M:  Uh hmm.]  
M:  It would be interesting to find out what he uses or how he uses them.  
J:  Sometimes he chews them up.  They chew the herbs up when he sprays it on the pussy 
willow.  [M:  Oh yeah.]  A certain part of the chanting that blows up the (--)  Have you see that 
before? [M:   I've heard about it, I haven't seen it.]  If you stay here all day, and you just kind of 
live here you could (--)  Actually, if you want, you know where that bed is downstairs?  I could 
make you a little corner there.  A lamp and a desk, you can just stay here.  You can see a lot more
that way.  You don't have to be asking me to sit down and tape record all the time.  You can just 
see what goes on.  If you want you can hang around with her.  [SNEEZING] If you want, if 
somebody comes in you can have them translate for you.  Just talk to the people.  They like it 
when Americans talk to them.  They are a little bit shy at first but they are nice.  When I first 
came here I treated a few woman.  And Munks are not suppose to toch woman, but Sucoon(?) 
gave me permission to do that because I am a good doctor.  And like a lot of the woman wouldn't
tell me what was wrong with them.  I had one woman who didn't have her period for 8 years.  
She wouldn't tell me that because it was related to the sexual stuff.  
M:  I know traditional practice, I don't know if it is done here, among cambodians.  It is to Isolate
a girl when she first starts to menstruate like for a month.   [J:  I don't know.  I don't know about 
that.]  Yeah.  Like a dark place.  Like in a room or something and you can not come out.  It's 
strange, huh.  [J:  Well it is just how they see it.]
J:  Sometimes we go to peoples houses like Laotion(?) people  especially they will bring two 
Buddha images.  Or one or two or three.  And we put a string from the Buddha image to a bowl 
of water, down through the hands of all the munks, and through the outside walls through the 
whole house and around the windows.  That's when we do like an exorcism.  [M:  Hmm.]  This 
string is for the vibration, that's all.  
M:  And you would do an ecorcism if there were what ghost, demons, what?
J:  Uh, if they would just feel like they have mental problems or they are just not good luck or 
they just want to get that exorcised out of them.   So we do like a long ceremony that lasts about 
2 1/2 hours just straight chanting.  And then we have two buckets (--) See those plastic buckets 
over there, we stand candles in them, you know those big candle stands down there with long 
candles, so there is candles burning in the buckets.  [M:  Water.]  yeah.  And with all the string 
tied to him and everything like that.  Then what we do afterwards, after we chant, we take the 
person outside and they have just like a bathing cloth [UNCLEAR] you pour the water on them.  
Each munk has one bucket.  People feel better afterwards.  
M:  They do that here.  Did you learn that here?  Or is that something more universal?  [J:  No, I 
learned that here.  It is Cambodian.]  Do they have a name for that ceremony? 
J:  Yeah, I don't know exactly what it is, so everybody tells me they are getting a bath.  "I'm 
going to get a bath from South Corner"  I say "Yeah really, does he wash behind the ears or 
what?"
M:  Do people bring little figures here? 
J:  Yeah, all those belong to people.  They bring them here, leave them here, to get charged up.  
[M:  Oh, I see.]  Just like the main charge (--)  "Yes, we're down at the Buddha Image Charging 
Station in North Chelmsford, we are getting a few of our Buddhist statues charged up for our 
son, he's moving out and going to college."  
M:  [UNCLEAR]
J:  People do that.  Like if they are moving to California, they will bring all of there Buddha 
images here and leave them sitting here and they'll stick them all in their car so they will have a 
safe trip out there.  [M:  Hmm.]  There is about 58 of them up there the last time I counted.  [M:  
That is a lot of them.  I noticed that there is different kinds.]  We have every thing from Japanese,
to Tye to Cambodian, to Betten(?), Sweeonca(?).
M:  It's just a matter of how he is dressed.  
J:  Yeah, it's just the cultural interpretation of a person.  I mean I can't see some dude with a 
haircut like that walking around India 2500 years ago.  It couldn't be that manicured, you know 
what I mean.  [M:  What is that [UNCLEAR] see with the big head dress.]  Oh that's from a story
in the Buddhist time when he was practicing meditation, and it was very bad weather, and his 
serpents or snake coiled himself around it to protect him.  That's what the Cambodians like that 
[UNCLEAR] with seven dragon heads, seven cobras.  Give my back a rest.
M:  I see the microphone stands up here.
J:  Yeah, we use them when we chant when there is lots of people in there.  It is really funny 
nobody ever keeps quiet during a ceremony.  People always doing a million things a once, you 
know what I mean.  Nobody ever (--) It seems like nobody ever gets into the spiritual aspect of 
it, they just let us do it by chanting.
M:  Is that unusual?
J:  Not really.  Most South East Asian places I have been to besides the Chinese they're always 
very quiet.  Chinese are very quiet.  South East Asians do what they want, and when they want.  
It's really funny, they are really strict in some ways and in other things they just don't really care. 
Like there kids, they don't manage the children in here at all.  Other things like bowing to the 
Munks, they are very strict about it, you know.  [M:  Like what?]  Bowing to the Munks.  [M:  
Oh.]  
M:  I noticed that it is pretty relaxed here in terms of people interacting with Munks and 
everything.
J:  Yeah, this place malfunctions as a Cambodian Social Center right now.  That is why we 
bought the house next door so we could have a Munks residence.   [M:  Which house?]]  Right 
directly next door here.  So that Munks can live like Munks, [UNCLEAR].  [M:  Separated.]  
Yeah, separated.  Society is a little lost, need a little more time to practice.  That's necessary.  A 
lot of the young Munks in this country have no training like myself because there is no 
monastery building where they can train you, you know what I mean?  You just kind of got to do 
everything on your own.  Sucoon's a great man to live with because he has been through that.  
He's had a lot of experience in all the different phases of fanatic management.  He knows how to 
do everything, you know.
M:  So why couldn't somebody like Sucoom(?) set up a training?
J:  Well you can but you need a lot of support for that.  You need money and a place, and you 
need on going support.  What he is trying to do here is pay for this building, the other one is paid 
for, when the building is paid for he is going (--) What he wants to do is to start training like they
did in the old country.  Have the Munks go out for arms with there bowl, have them deliver a 
sermon every 15 days.  What's the matter?  
M:  I am just thinking that would be tough to go out with your parole.
J:  But see what you would have to do is you condense, I call it the condense arms round.  You 
just line the people up every 10-15 feet, you put a family.  That way on the weekends, or you just
restrict it to weekends or special holiday's, people can line up out there along the street and it 
would be good for us and good for them.  
M:  I think it would be good for the non-Asians to see it too.  
J:  It's a very definite part of the practice of being a Buddhist Munk.  The name Biccu(?) means 
mendican(?) or beggar.  Not really beggar, you can't really beg for food, but since you are 
begging for food, that's what the word Biccu(?) means, that's what the Munks title it.  
Sucoon's(?) name is [UNCLEAR]  You know, all Munks have that name Biccu(?).  I don't have 
that name, I'm Suminara(?) which means I am a Nomis(?).  [M:  Uh.]  That's what Biccu(?) 
means. And he feels that you have to preserve the religion.  You have to keep the custom, 
someone intact to make the transition to this country.  You know what I mean?  [M:  Yeah, but I 
mean even he is having a hard time.  He can't go out and do the things outside that he is suppose 
to do.]  Yeah.  [M:  He can't walk.  I guess he can.]  He can but who wants to get bothered just 
because you want to live your life the way we do?  You know?  [M:  You need a retreit.]  Huh?  
[M:  You need a retriet.  A place out in the woods.]  Yeah.  [M:  Is there any kind of a national 
organization?]  National?  I think there is a National Cambodian Federation of  Buddhist Munks. 
[M:  Yeah.  Sort of Religious.]  There is a Tye(?) group of (--)  And I think all the major 
representations of Buddhism, like the Chinese has a (--), a United Group in the United States of 
Canada.  The Tubetans(?) do, the Vietnamese do, the Japanese do.  I think they all have like there
own little groups.  There's no like cooperative between them.  [M:  But I mean even if you had a 
Cambodian one, they have no funding to help establish the training center.]  No, they are just 
basically trying to get the people to be generous and keep the religion in there mind, and then 
make the other part of it later on.  [M:  So if you go outside here, you get hassled by (--)]  I've 
been hassled, yeah.  [M:  By kids?]  No grown ups.  Workers, like the guys from the Electric 
Company next door or the Construction guys down there.  You know, older guys, my age, and a 
little older.  [M:  What do they say?]  You know, the usual shit.  "Hey where did you get the 
fucking curtain, man?  Hey [UNCLEAR]  There's no airports around here, what are you doing 
here?"  You know, stuff like that.  Most of it is because they just don't know who you are.  [M:  
Right.]  Once you talk to them, they like you.  Like some people (--)  I was walking down the 
street one day, it was punk rock girls, she had her hair shaved on the side and it was all spikes, it 
was like 8:00 in the morning.  They were just waking up, her and her boyfriend, were crawling 
out of a car in Lowell.  And they saw me walking down the street and this girl started laughing so
hard that she fell down.  And I said "Hey baby what's the matter, you never seen a real Punk 
Rocker before?  I gave up on everything, I am a total revolutionary, you know, get with it."  And 
they started talking with me.  We got to be friends.  Her and her boyfriend, and they asked me 
what I was into, and I told them I am a Buddhist Munk, I am not a freak or a weirdo.  
[CLEARING THROAT]  [M:  People have to understand.]  Yeah.  I think it was a Greek guy that
came here and brought some clothes here the other day, and when he saw me he said "Do you 
have to wear that toga outside?"  I said yeah, this is a munk.  Munks clothes like priest you have 
to wear a collar all the time, or you have to wear black clothes, you know, it is the same thing, 
just the way we live so that people know what we are.  He said "Well don't you get hassled about 
that in public?"  Yeah.  "Well doesn't that bother you?"  Well yeah it bothers me but I like 
Buddhism so much that I put up with a lot of that crap just to be able to come to this country in 
some form or another, you know.  
J:  We'll be right back, uh, doc, what are you going to play for us for this commercial break?  
Could never imitate Johnny Carson.  He's hard.  Ed Sullivan is easy.  Johnny Carson is hard.  [M:
Carson is just too straight and there is nothing really peculiar about it.]  Yeah, the electric 
company guys were yelling at me one day.  "Hey what are you anyway?"  I said I work for Mass 
Electric what does it look like.  What are guys Buddhist Munks wearing those goofy yellow 
helmets?  They started laughing.  It was funny.  "We never talked to no munks before.  Well there
is not that many in this country, you know.  If you have a question ask me, talk to me, I'm not a 
weirdo.  [M:  So they talk to you?]  Yeah, they wave to me and everything, you know.  
Construction guys are a little more hard nosed.  There more, you know (--).  Italian workers, my 
good workers I call them.  They drive all the way from Chelsea and stuff.  He's boss of them who
come here to put sewer pipes in.  [M:  I guess that is what they are doing (--)]  Sewage.  [M:  
They had this street blocked off, detoured.]  It's funny I was walking down by the driveway, 
"Hey Al, Al.  Three or four of them walking down the driveway looking at me.  I turn around 
they all try to make like they are not looking at me.  I go "Hey check it out, check out these 
legs."  They go "Hey that guy speaks English you know."  I said "Yeah I speak English, I worked
on cars for 20 years, Jack."  I speak regular straight, street English and it really blows them away
to associate that language with the way I look.  
M:  But when Soccune(?) walks out he can't understand a lot of what they are saying, right. 
J:  Yeah, he will always say to me "What are they saying?"  They are telling us that we are ugly 
and bold.  "What does ugly mean?"  Ugly means no good, lumbark(?).  Oh, oh, oh, ugly, okay.  I 
like ugly.  He is funny, you know.  [M:  Do you think it would be any different if this temple was 
any closer to where most of the people live?]  No, because you are in America.  When you go out
there is no way you can avoid going through American Neighborhoods.  There is just no way.  
You know.  That doesn't matter that much, because Munks don't go out that much and I never go 
shopping.  Sometimes, like if I wanted to go out for a walk in the woods, I would think twice 
about it.  I would bring a couple of guys with me.  [M:  Uh huh.]  I wouldn't want to get jumped 
or beat up by somebody, you know.  I don't know, that stuff happens.  I am not paranoid about it. 
You know what I mean.  I can still take care of myself, but, sometimes you think twice about 
going someplaces because you don't know what is going to happen there.  [M:  That is because 
you stick out.]  Yeah, I mean I wouldn't go Downtown Lowell, say at 11:00 at night, I would not 
go downtown Lowell looking for somebodies house if I didn't know where they lived.  I just 
wouldn't do it on foot, I wouldn't do it.  [M:  But you are allowed to drive a car.]  Uh, I haven't 
really confronted that issue at all.  [M:  Soccune(?) doesn't drive?]  No he doesn't have a license. 
See I have a driver's license.  I imagine if we got into a jam or something I would drive.  [M:  
But you don't know if it would be right?]  Well they were letting the munks drive before then 
they just decided against it because a lot of the people were saying stuff about the Munks, 
driving around too much, and stuff like that.  
M:  It is interesting how an old religion in a very different culture comes over here and tries to 
make it.  
J:  Yeah.  Buddhism had to do that in every country it has gone to.  Because of one:  it came from
India, which is a hot climate, the temperatures average 100 degrees all year round.  Then it 
moved up to Tabetan(?) [UNCLEAR]  it is freezing cold up there.  There is nothing to eat up 
there.  So the robes had to change.  The Munks started to wear boots and hats.  Then it went to 
China, and the Chinese being such meticulous scholars and so much to etticate and tact and all 
that stuff, that they just made everything really fine.  Where as [UNCLEAR]  sort of like crude.  
They just wear the same robes but real thick.  The Chinese tailored everything, and make it real 
nice.  And they tailored it into the monastic system into the Chinese Monastic System.  It wasn't 
really a Monastic system in the beginning.  The Buddha just say "Hey you want to live like me, 
come on, lets go, lets live together."  [M:  Uh huh.]  And that is how the whole thing started.  
There were never even any wordinations(?).  He use to say, Hey He Biccu(?)  That means come 
on.   Come Munk, become a Munk.  There were no wordinations(?), no rules or nothing.  If you 
wanted to become a Munk and shave your head and wear an orange cloth, everybody just 
assumed that you knew that you had to be selvant and not be intoxicated, and not steel and lie 
and stuff.  And in that time of history, it was assumed that who ever wore the orange or safon(?) 
cloth and a shaved head was a renounced man or woman.  [M:  Women could be Munks too?]  
No, not then but later on.  The first Monastic or contemplative [UNCLEAR] of woman was 
Buddhist in this world.  There was a very revolutionary thing that the Buddha did in India, there 
were 96 religions at the time, all mainly based on Hinduism(?), deology(?), polytheism, 
monotheism.  You know, and all that stuff.  And the woman, there job was in the house, and take 
care of the babies and all that.  The Buddha did a revolutionary thing by giving women, not an 
equal place, but he gave them the opportunity to practice meditation and teach them and let them 
become nuns.  
J:  Boy that thing goes fast, huh.  [M:  Hmm.]  Is it almost over on this side?  [M:  30 minutes.]  
30 minutes?  [M:  Well it is a 60 minute tape.]  The mouse again.
M:  Do people bring all of these things?
J:  Yeah, these are all offerings.
M:  Flowers, candles.  
J:  They bring artificial flowers because you can't go picking flowers like you can in Cambodia 
where you could pick beautiful flowers.  Here you can't buy them so they just buy artificial ones 
because they last longer.
M:  Some people make them in the community.
J:  Yeah.  Those Lotis(?) flowers, some lady made those.  
M:  Joe was selling them at the store and I asked him about it.  He use to come in every day.  
Same with these things, I don't know (--) they are like temples.  
J:  Yeah, I don't know what they are?  I am not sure.  [M:  They look like anchor rods or 
something.]  Yeah.  [M:  I guess they are offerings.]  Some kind of offering, yeah.  [M:  Well this 
one has a little slot in it.]  Yeah, it is donation books.  It is for some particular fund or something, 
cause there are four of them here.
END OF SIDE ONE
BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO
TAPE BEGINS WITH INFORMANT EXPLAINING:  Everybody picks their particular thing 
that they want to express.  
M:  It is tied to a specific (--)
J:  In China, like for instance, in China they have five different schools of Buddhism.  
[CLEARING THROAT]  Okay, five main schools of Buddhism.  They study all five different 
aspects of Buddhism.  One is a discipline school, one is the purelant school, [M:  The what?]  
Purelant.  [M:  Purelant?]  Yeah.  They recite Montra's(?) hoping to be reborn in this purelant 
where there are several body suckers(?) and Buddhist already living there teaching Buddhism to 
people that take birth there.  Discipline, purelant, zen, uh, ideological(?) school, and the uh, 
Esoteric school.  [M:  Do those acquaint with other sets of Buddhism anywhere else?]  No, it's 
totally, totally, (--)  It has the same things like in the ideological school it's like [UNCLEAR] that
is the same as like in Burma(?) they study that intensely, that is mainly what they study in Burma
is [UNCLEAR].  Cambodia mainly they study the [UNCLEAR] which is like a collective saying,
poetic saying, so the Buddha will put it into numerical verses like ones, two's, three's, four's, 
five's, like that, eight's.  And they studied the [UNCLEAR] which is the, uh, the description of 
practice for the really theoretical prospective.  It's written more by a scholar than a practiced 
Munk.  But it has completely compiled everything in Buddhism, and condensed it into one 
volume, called the [UNCLEAR]  Path of Purification.  [M:  So is it prescriptive?  I mean is it 
telling people how they should live?]  Yeah, it tells you everything, about how to practice 
meditation, how to build a monastery, what are the 18 faults of a monastery, where to put a 
monastery, which direction this should be in, how to make the water, and how to make medicine,
how to tell a good teacher from a bad teacher, the credentials of a teacher.  You know, like that.  
It tells you everything about Buddhism that you want to know.  Basically, and that's what 
Cambodians study now.  And they also study a book called the [UNCLEAR] which is logic.  And
it is a discussion between this Buddhist Munk who is fairly young but he was enlightened at an 
early age.  And this Greek king Beander(?) And this king presents all these questions to him and 
he asked for several explanations of each one so it turns into logic, debate or logic.  It's good.  
[M:  That is incredible.  That must have been recorded or at least remembered from (--)]  It was 
recorded.  That one wasn't by memorization.  Most of them were by memorization.  All Buddhist
Sutra's(?) (--) Sutra means garland or thread, words threaded together.  When Buddhist spoke 
they called it a Sutra.  His cousin [UNCLEAR] was his right hand man.  He memorized, he had 
an incredible memory, and he would stand there and memorize all the Buddhist discourses and 
repeat them to people.  ANd they always started out with "Thus have I heard" [NOW, SAID IN 
DIFFERENT LANGUAGE] Always, thus have I heard.  [READING PAPER IN DIFFERENT 
LANGUAGE] Thus have I heard, at one time the exulted(?) one will stay in your sole, 
[UNCLEAR].  See he describes the place, then a certain Devaour(?) Selesual(?) being in that last
[UNCLEAR] lit up the whole of the grove and he approached the Buddha, after he approached 
the Buddha he respected him and stood at one side.  And standing there at one side he talked to 
the Buddha like this.  There's many Selesual(?) beings of men who have pondered on blessing 
and they long for safety.  What are the highest blessings?  And so the Buddha will go on and tell 
him.  That's what they call a Sutra or Suta(?).  I got lost.  Where were we?
M:  Talking about the different varieties of Buddhism.  
J:  Oh yeah, okay.  
M:  We were talking about the Cambodian.  Now is that (--)
J:  We made 20 of these when I became a Munk.  Boleyu(?) chanting with translation. 
[TALKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE] Not to consult with [UNCLEAR] 
M:  Now who made that book?
J:  This book?  Me.  This is from a translation from Tyland(?) but I had the original made, it was 
all falling apart so I had 20 of these printed from a copy place.  [M:  Oh, okay.  So do the other 
people use that here?]  Yeah.  [LOOKING THROUGH PAGES] [M:  Did you take instruction 
here?]  What in Boley(?)?  No.  Yeah.  Or just in anything before you became a Munk here.  No.  
I came up here and talked to Soccune(?) for three months and he knew I had already practiced 
Buddhism a fair amount.  He knew I already knew I wanted to be a Munk.  He knew I knew 
what I was getting into.  [COUGHING]  I didn't really know I was getting into it like this though.
I didn't think it was going to be this strange.  [M:  What it's different from the Chinese Temple?]  
Yeah, much different.  [M:  Is that you've been mostly?  Chinese Temples.]   Yeah.  Uh hmm.  
And my house.  My house is always like a Chinese Temple Monastery.  [M:  So what is the main 
difference?]  Oh, everything is unstructured.  [M:  Here?]  You never know who is going to eat 
breakfast and how much food they are going to cook, or who is going to come and cook lunch?  
[M:  Do you think this because of the way they are here or (--)]  Uh, it's just the way the 
Cambodians, and South East Asian Buddhism is like that.  They are very laid back, sleepy kind 
of people.  
M:  So what happens here on Sunday's?
J:  It's never the same.  It never is.  Sunday I am not here that much anymore.  [M:  That's right, 
you said that.]  I go to the Chinese Temple.  But usually breakfast, somebody will come and cook
breakfast.  Then some families will come to lunch, they will ask for the five presteps(?), 
Soccune(?) will give them the five presteps(?).  And then we will chant blessings and stuff like 
that.  And then if people want to have memorable things for their relatives, they take one of these
things, put a thing of incents on it, some candles, some cigarettes, some money, or something 
like that, come and borrow two or three times.  What do you want?  Okay.  Then he will tell you 
what we have to chant.  [M:  I thought they did that after breakfast that one day.]  Yeah.  [M:  
Now the offerings, is that for the Munk?]  Yeah.  [M:  So, Sunday Service is not much different?]
There's no real structure to it.  I mean, this place here is if you need to see the Munk about 
something, you just come and see him.  Because everybody is so different, you can't just have 
one particular service for everybody, you know what I mean?  [M:  Uh hmm.]  At least that's 
what I get out of it.  [M:  So it is not like everybody shows up here at 9:00 in the morning.]  No, 
there are people that usually show up around 10:00 on Sunday if they want to hear chanting.  [M:
So what happens at the Chinese Temple that is different?]  They practice.  [M:  Very structured.]  
Yeah, they have a very structured regiment.  Is that right?  [M:  Yeah regiment.]  Regiment, 
regiment, regiment, yeah he was [UNCLEAR]  They are very structured.  They are more into 
practicing Buddhism than just hanging around the Temple.  They have no Munks there except for
me.  So they (--)  [M:  How long have they had a Temple?]  About two years.  It is not really a 
Temple.  It is more like an association in one of the members house.  And they set aside a room 
for a wide meditation room, like a little dining room where they all eat together.  
M:  So the people that go there are Chinese Americans?
J:  Chinese, yeah, Tiawan(?).  Mostly students at University of Lowell and Harvard.  [M:  What 
did they do before they you came up there?]  They just had their weekly meetings.  I don't really 
affiliate in anything, I'm just kind of the resident of Munks there.  Come over there and join the 
program and I lead a meditation group in the afternoon.  [M:  Are you helping instruct people 
here?]  Yeah.  I have lots of students.  [M:  Meditation and so on?  How do you do that?]  What 
do you mean?  [M:  Uh, well it is hard to communicate?]  Most of the people that want to 
approach me about that can usually speak English well enough.  [M:  Where they young people?]
There is a variety.  I have some old woman that I teach.  Some high school kids.  [M:  What do 
they come at a certain time each week or (--)]  No, they just show up [M:  They just show up.] 
when they have time.  They say "John, what can you teach me today?"  I say "What do you want 
to learn?"  [M:  That sounds like the satratic method to be (--) Answer a question with a 
question.]  It works good.  [M:  Is that the way of Buddhism too?]  That was the way I was 
taught.  [M:  What's the bottom line for Buddhism?]  What do you mean?  [M:  What's the 
intention?]  Refrain from wicked evil, cultivate the good, purify ones mind.  That's what they call
in Buddhism, the call it [SAID IN BUDDHISM LANGUAGE]  Rules for everybody.  [M:  What
are the five presteps?]  No killing, no stealing, no lieing no allisit sexual activity, and no 
intoxication.  Basically, good, all American.  [M:  You act like it is the Ten Commandments.  
Reduced to five.]  Yeah.  Throw in a little wisdom, and meditation practice and you got 
something.  That's the one thing that I didn't like about Christianity, the don't teach you how to 
practice anymore.  They just tell you what to do, [M:  Or  not to do.]  Believe this, don't believe 
that.  [M:  Well Meditation is definitely not a (--)]  Well they have meditation in the Catholic 
Church but you have to find a good priest or a good Munk that will teach you and take the time, 
and if your not like Catholic Munks, if your not a munk they don't bother with you usually.  How
many Catholic Munks have you seen?  None.  How many Catholic Munks have any Catholics 
seen?  None.  They're all cloistered.  Some ways it is good for the Munk to live like that but in 
other ways it is bad for society because they never get to see what they are supporting, you know.
M:  Okay, when you talk about say a Buddhist [UNCLEAR] Munk does he teach?
J:  Yeah, sure.  [M:  When he comes out?]  Yeah.  They have to.  Buddhist Munk has to teach 
everything, every fifteen days.  You have to have contact with lay people.  It is against the rules 
not to.  They support us, we support them.  [M:  So meditation, and mind phonos connected?]  
Yeah.  You have to learn meditation in order to be mindful. [M:  So what is being mindful?]  
Mindful is when you right now what is going on.  You don't think about the past and you don't 
speculate about the future.  Mindfulness is when you lifting something, you know, or I am just 
lifting it and not attached to what it is or where you are going with it or what value of it is or any 
of that stuff.  And that is being mindful.  You just know what you are doing right now.  Like if 
you are walking, you are just walking.  You are not thinking about looking here and smelling 
this, feeling that, touching that.  You know what I mean?  Just one thing.  [M:  So what is the 
value of that?  What is the point?]  You are not confused all the time.  You just know things.  [M: 
You have to eliminate suffering.]  No, it doesn't eliminate suffering, you still suffer, but you are 
not attached to suffering.  You know what I mean?  There is a big difference.  No matter what 
you do in this world, as long as you live in this world and you have a body, you are going to 
suffer.  Because, basically, we are made out of five things that are impermanent.  We have a 
body, we have feeling that are associated with a body and a mind and indifference.  We have 
memories, perception, bolision, or the ability to do things.  And we have consciousness.  All 
those five things are what makes up a personality.  One belongs to the body group and four 
belongs to the mind group.  Okay.  All those things are impermanent.  And all those things, when
we associate them with us, ourself like our body, "This is my body, it is beautiful, and it is never 
going to get old."  And that is dilution, and then you have suffering, physical suffering.  Feelings,
"Oh, I feel so good today."  And all of a sudden the other side comes.  You know what I mean?  
[M:  Yeah.]  Buddhism is not very deep, really.  It's just very simple.  Just explains what 
everything is, you know, that's all it does.  It just tells you what everything is.  It doesn't use any 
conjection or speculation, you can find it all out for yourself.  Or you just sit down and think 
about it, practice meditation.  [M:  So what ever truths there are come from the dead?]  Yeah. [M:
I mean you have them?]  Yeah.  Everybody has that.  Everybody has suffering.  There's not one 
person in the world that doesn't have suffering.  I don't care how much money they have or how 
much solitude they have in their life.  Everybody has suffering.  Some degree of suffering in their
life.  Everyday, you know.  Easy to prove, too.  I can make people suffer very easy, just sit there 
like that until I tell you to move.  No, two or three hours you wont (--) you'll say "John let me out
of this position, I'm suffering, [UNCLEAR].  A lot of people tell me that suffering is bull shit.  I 
tell them, okay, stand there, and don't move any part of your body.  "Hey can I move now, five 
minutes later?"  Why?  "I don't feel good, my body hurts, my legs are killing me."  Well, I 
thought you didn't have any suffering, control it, you have control of your body, your in control.  
M:  Now is that one of the points in meditation?
J:  The first thing you have to learn about meditation is that you have to learn about yourself.  
You look at you body and your mind, the nature of the body and mind, how you are always 
changing and going different ways and like that.  That is the first thing you learn.  You have to 
learn about yourself, investigate yourself.  It is like writing a class paper.  You have to do 
research first, you know.  You have to research yourself.  Question.  "This body of mine, this 
mind."  [M:  Are there certain instructive ways to do that?]  Yeah.  [M:  Questions to ask?]  Not 
really questions, you just observe things.  Like when you first sit down and teacher might tell 
you just to observe your breathing.  You will start to observe your breathing and all of a sudden 
your mind starts raising around your body, it becomes uncomfortable.  Now, what did you learn 
from that?  Well my mind isn't stasil(?) and my body is uncomfortable.  So they will tell you to 
keep watching your breathing, when you start thinking about your mind and your body, go back 
to your breathing.  Notice that you are thinking away from that and go back to your breathing.  
You always go back to your breathing.  You take one thing, like some people repeat words, some 
people use breathing, some people use this, some people walk.  [M:  Just something to focus on.]
Yeah.  Just basically that is what you are doing.  Every teacher has a different way of practicing.  
Because basically, uh, 48, actually there are 84,000 ways to practice meditation.  But there are 48
basic ways that they teach, you know.  Every teacher has a little thing that they developed and 
they teach there students like that.  Or they teach them a way that they can see (--) There is not 
really just one system like you can't say Buddhism, you never say "Everybody has to practice 
mindfulness and breathing or it is wrong."  They never say that.  They say whatever your 
problem is you have to identify your own problem or have your teacher help you identify your 
problem and give you the appropriate medicine for it.  [M:  Do a lot of people that come to the 
temple here, do they practice meditation?]  Yeah.  I wouldn't say a great deal of them but I would
say there is a small minority/majority lets call it something like that.  You know what I mean?  
[M:  I wonder why more don't if it's (--)]  A lot of people don't have time and think only Munks 
can meditate.  Like when I first become a Munk, people say "I would like to meditate, but I am 
not a Munk."  I say hey I think I got ripped off on my [UNCLEAR] they forgot to give me my 
meditative abilities because they didn't give that, they only gave me was these robes and a whole 
bunch of words to say.  And I said "I practice much more before I was a Munk then I do now.  
You know, sitting meditation."  [M:  You said that the Munks here meditate lieing down.]  There 
is four ways to practice.  Sit, stand, walk, and lye.  [M:  You can meditate while you are 
walking?]  Yeah.  Sitting meditation, walking meditation, standing meditation, and lying down 
Meditation.  Lieing down is usually like this [SHOWING INTERVIEWER HOW IT IS DONE] 
on the right side, I have to lay this way obviously.  Or you lye like this, sometimes like this, 
something like sitting like this.  [M:  Do most people just pick one of those, usually?]  Usually 
everybody sits and walks.  That is the most popular.  Lieing down, not many people do that 
really, I don't think.  And standing up, many people do that.  Even standing is hard.  [M:  I think 
walking would be hard.]  No, walking is easy.  I will show you.  Walking meditation.  [M:  
Yeah.]  You learn a simple technique like this is the [UNCLEAR]  It's where you label all 
activities of the body and the mind.  Like, now I was thinking my mind is standing, standing, 
standing, just standing.  I'm just mindful of standing.  I am not repeating standing, I am not 
spelling the word standing in my mind, I am just mindful in my mind that I am standing.  Now, I 
know that I am going to walk, so I have an intention.  So I make a mental note of that intention.  
Now, I am shifting my weight, lifting, moving, touching, placing, standing, lifting, moving, 
placing.  You just walk like that.  You break your walk into simple steps.  That's how you want it.
That is the first step in meditation.  I walk fast, I walk like this. [SHOWING HIM HOW HE 
WALKS] [UNCLEAR] 
M:  You break it down into little units of now.
J:  Yeah.
M:  What you are doing now.
J:  What you are doing now.  When you loose tract of where you are you stop.  And you stand 
there until you regain your mind from this, and when you regain your mind from this, you 
continue with your practice.  [M:  The implication of walking meditation is that it's external 
things the environment stimilizes, are not going to disrupt (--)]  Hey, all you are going to do (--) 
your not going to stop all those things from exisisting, you're just not going to act on all the 
imputs, you know.  It's like when you become a Munk you sullivate.  You still have impulses, 
and you still like woman and breasts and all that stuff, they're still very attracted to you, you 
know what I mean.  It doesn't mean it stopped there because you are a Munk.  You still have all 
those things coming up in your mind, but the thing is you don't act on them.  Normally, what we 
do is when we are a regular person, like me in my business, I would see beautiful woman come 
in my shop and automatically that sexual side of you takes over.  That evil side of you, man and 
woman thing, happens.  And you just start talking without even knowing you flirt, and like that.  
When you are a Munk you just don't act on those impulses.  You just observe them and realize 
what they are and then they go away.  They next thing comes up and it is like that all day long.  
[M:  But isn't it easier to meditate if you are isolated?]  Yeah, it is easier.  [M:  You know, if it is 
quiet and it is not too bright.]  Yeah, it is easier.  [M:  So your senses (--)]  It is easier but when 
you don't have that situation you just have to use what you have.  It is like somebody says well 
we don't have anything to cook this food in, but we are all starving.  What are you going to do, 
sit there and starve until somebody figures out how to make a pot?  No, you just figure out ways 
to eat it, you know, so.  Meditation is the same way.  If you don't have an ideal place, quiet, you 
just have to learn how to use the environment.  Like here I use hearing a lot.  I sit outside the 
train goes by and the generator is humming over there and their is people running around.  I just 
listen to hearing and it is all on the outside.  It is not inside of me.  [M:  Soccune(?) was talking 
about the music that the birds make, the music of the forest.  He doesn't like the city.  It is not 
music to him.]  It is noise in the forest, too.  The jungle is very wild.  [M:  Yeah, but to him it is 
music.]  Some people gunfire doesn't bother them.  To me, if you shot a few rounds off next to 
me, I would wonder what was going on, you know.  It is just a matter of the environment.  I like 
doing that stuff.  A little holy water for the rug.  
J:  How are you feeling?
M:  I feel good.  
J:  Yeah, good.  [M:  How is your tongue?]  Uh, changed.  [M:  Really.]  [LAUGHING]  It is just 
stuff that works, you know.  [M:  When did you first get into Chinese Medicine?]   About 16 
years ago.  [M:  And who was practicing it?]  My teacher, Chinese Munk, I learned with.  I was 
always interested in medicine anyway.  I like that stuff.  I was always (--)  I liked it.  [M:  Yeah, I 
do too.]  I put a lot of time into it on my own, you know. [M:  Were they written?]  Oh, yeah.  
[M:  Lots of written [UNCLEAR] and stuff?] Oh yeah, yeah.  The oldest one is about 3300 years 
old.  [UNCLEAR]  [M:  And they use the same ingredients?]  Basically, yeah, just about.  The 
same needle points and everything.  [M:  What does Chinese Medicine include then?  
Acupuncture?]  Acupuncture.  Uh, massage, uh, exercise, uh, estrology, diet, meditation.  
[UNCLEAR]  herbs.  [M:  What would you call the pills?]  That is herbal medicine.  Those are 
all made from herbs.  All the ingredients are on there if you have a (--) [M:  They are not 
chemicals?]  No.  I will show you some of my stuff that I have today.  I will take you downstairs 
and show you some.  This holy water is great for arthritis.  [M:  You have arthritis?]  Yeah.  [M:  
From one injury?]  Mike, I have been so banged up in my life.  [M:  What did you do to your 
thumb?]  I cut if off.  [M:  How?]  I fell through a window, and I reached up to grab something 
and it was an air compressor and when I pulled on the belts it started up and it flipped me 
[UNCLEAR] and it cut three of my fingers off.  [M:  Wow.]  It was a heavy experience, man.  
[M:  Yeah, I guess.  Were you practicing Buddhism at the time?]  No, I was practicing how to be 
a 14 kid who wanted to be a mechanic and work in a garage.  I disobeyed my mother.  "Go fuck 
your (--)" "I am going to the garage, I don't want to be a dumb doctor."  16 years old, I (--)  well 
actually, before I was about 14 before I cut my fingers off, I use to draw a lot and paint a lot.  I 
applied to Rhode Island Institute of Design they had me draw a lot of things.  They come up to 
see me at my house in Amsbury(?) and were offering me a scholarship and I told them no, I want
to be a mechanic.   I remember that.  I could have had a scholarship.  I was a little arrogant about 
it, too.  [M:  Most people don't associate mechanics with spirituality.]  I have had a lot of 
pycotheripist and pycologists 
come in and I just goof on them.  Drop thing on them, Oh, yes, that must be because of the 
emerges of [UNCLEAR] obviously.  Funominon, has not been quite enumerated to that point.  
And they go "cars?"  Yeah, cars.  A little physic realinement on this one.  I use to have a lot of 
fun goofing on the people, you know. Playing like a dumb mechanic.  I'm going "you dumby".  If
people only knew what I was thinking they would be doing kartwheels in here.  
M:  So when is the last time you worked on a car?
J:  About 6 1/2 months ago.  [M:  Do you miss that?]  Of course I do, I did it for 20 years, man.  
You know?  I have $40,000 worth of tools sitting down in the basement.  [M:  Right here?]  
Yeah.  That is the only thing that I did not give up.  I gave everything else up.  I kept my tools 
incase I ever needed them, incase I had to go to work, incase my father dies and my mother 
needs me to come help.  [M:  What, you can go back to that?]  Easy.  [M:  In turns of being a 
Munk you only commit yourself for a certain amount of time, right?]  No, I haven't committed 
myself for any period of time.  [M:  But I mean, people have become Munks for one week.]  
Yeah, and then they (--) [M:  So it is a kind of obligation to the family or something.]  Yeah.  Her
son was a Munk for one week, just so that she could see him as a Munk before she passed away.  
[M:  Her son or (--)]  Her son, yeah.  Her son.  He lived with me for a week or a week and a half.
We ate real good that week.  His wife came everyday and took care of us.  Two meals a day.  [M:
She would bring you some non-meat stuff.]  Yeah.  Most of the people know that I am a 
vegetarian, now.  [M:  Why did they think it was funny that I (--)]  They thought it was great that 
you were a vegetarian.  they think it is good that people don't eat meat.  [M:  They think it is 
good?  Well why do they?]  They are just use to it, its their culture, and they don't feel like it 
necessary to eat meat.  Buddhism doesn't say that you have to be a vegetarian.  I am basically a 
vegetarian because I wouldn't really want to have somebody do that to my kids, you know what I
mean.  If I was a (--) "Yeah, well Gese(?), my and the wife are a little hungry today, why don't 
we take one of your kids out and barbecue him."  Yeah, which one do you want the boys or the 
girls?  [M:  Take the fat one.]  Yeah, okay take the chubby one, he eats to much anyway.  You 
know.  It is the same thing, I tell these people, I say why do you think the communist came into 
your town and just randomly picked out people and shot them.  That's just like the guy who goes 
fishing.  Throws the net in the water.  He doesn't care what the fishes name is or who he related 
to.  Yeah, it is like the Jews getting killed in Germany in World War II.  The collective comma, 
that's all it is.  No big mystery.  The cambodian collective comma.  The people in Ethiopia, 
collective comma, the people in Nuganda(?), collective comma.  Whenever big groups of people 
like that get annaliated its for a reason.  What is the reason, because god says "Yeah, the 
Birdseens(?), yeah, we got to let them go, so tell your brother Jacob to get out of town."  You 
know.  
M:  So what is Carma(?)?
J:  Carma(?)?  It is a hard term to describe.  Cause and effect.  It is like if you plant a apple seed, 
you are going to get an apple tree, right?  [M:  Yeah.]  Well that is carma(?).  If you stab 
somebody in the back, you are always looking.  [M:  So what it is an inevitable sequence of 
events?]  The thing to do is to break that inevitable sequence.  And what you have to do first is 
you have to understand your body and mind, you know, to see how your body and mind are react
to your environment.  Then you can break that sequence, until you understand your body and 
mind you are not going to break anything but wind.  [LAUGHING]  You know what I mean?  
[M:  Now, how can you break an inevitable sequence like planting an apple seed and apple tree?]
Well you can break an inevitable sequence of a version.  Like say the inevitable sequence of a 
version.  If you know something is going to bother you and you know why it is going to bother 
you and you analyzed it and inscriptianise it, when the next time it comes up the chances of that 
bothering you is highly unlikely.  Unless you let it carry you away again.  [M:  Right.]  
J:  How am I doing anyway?
M:  Great.
J:  How are my answers, are they okay?  [M:  Yeah.]  Do they make sense?  Buddhism and 
lecture by John Massey.  [M:  It is necessary.  You cant expect outsiders to talk until they know 
what is going on here.]  If you are really interested in the Buddhist aspect of this then you keep 
asking me questions and I can answer anything you have.  That is the best way for me to talk.  
Because if you ask me on little (--)  As you know if you just ask me a few questions than I will 
start going, you know.  [M:  How were the questions?]  Good.  What is this tape almost over?  
[M:  Yeah.]  Go ahead, ask me (--)
