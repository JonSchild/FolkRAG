Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
I have been contacted by the University of Tennessee
 
Press, who tell me that they have already been in
 
touch with either you or Ms. Jones.
 It appears that
 
they are considering bringing out a new edition of
 
STEP IT DOWN, and are just now looking into the
 
specifics.
 One concern expressed to me dealt with
 
permissions.
 Are the permissions you obtained for
 
the Harper & Row edition valid for all editions of
 
the book, or the H&R only.
 If there are permissions
 
that would have to be re-obtained, could you estimate
 
how many, and what amount of money might be involved
 
(you might just want to add up the original charges
 
for the H&R permissions, and we could then adjust it
 
inflation-wise).
 
I imagine you are pleased that the book will be available
 
again, and welcome any comments or suggestions you may
 
have in preceeding with UTP.
 Please feel free to ask any
 
questions, and I
'll look forward to receiving whatever
 
information you can provide me with regarding the above
 
questions.
 
Sincerely,
 
Eric Flaum

Dear Mr. Bishop:
 
I left a message for you to return my call, but I understand that you will
 
be on vacation for a number of days.
 Therefore, let me put in writing what
 
I was going to ask you.
 
First of all, thanks very much for sending me copies of the various docu-
ments having to do with STEP IT DOWN.  The main reason for my telephone call
 
was to tell you that I have not received the additional copies of the book
 
that you said you were sending to me under separate cover.
 I need these
 
copies to send to advisers who will evaluate the book as a reprint possibil-
ity for the University of Tennessee Press.
 So, I cannot really take the
 
next step until I have the books in hand.
 
I do have one question about the contract that you sent to me.
 The termina-
tion agreement dated 26 September 1983 between Hawes/Jones and Harper & Row
 
refers to an agreement dated 12 February 1969, then it later refers to
 
clauses 7
, 19, and 20 of that agreement.  However, the agreement between
 
Hawes/Jones and Harper & Row that you sent me is dated 25 March 1969, and
 
contains no such clauses.
 I don't imagine in the long run this would make
 
any difference, but if you have a copy of the agreement dated 1
2 February
 
1
969, I would appreciate having a copy.
 
Additionally, the termination agreement refers to Curtis Brown as the au-
thors' agents, whereas the Harper & Row agreement dated 25 March 1969 refers
 
to an agent named Collins-Knowlton-Wing.  My only question here is whether
 
there is any longer any agent involved with the rights to this book.
 
Finally, would you confirm that the following person is the agent for Ludlow
 
Music from whom I should get confirmation that Ludlow Music would allow us
 
to reprint the music for $1.00:
 Richard Brackman, Richmond Organization, 10
 
Columbus Circle, New York, NY  10019 (
212-765-9889)?
 
Thanks again for all your help, and best wishes to you,
 
Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Bishop:
 
I thought I should let you know at once that we have decided, with some reluc-
tance not to issue a paperback reprint of STEP IT DOWN.  All of our advisers
 
had good things to say about the book, so our decision reflects in no way upon
 
the value of STEP IT DOWN.  Our decision reflects primarily marketing consid-
erations.  While it appears that there would be some small market for the book
 
among folklorists, the primary market would be in the field of education, and
 
that is a market that we are not equipped to reach.
 
Perhaps you will be able to find another publisher, one with a strong list in
 
elementary education, who would be interested in taking on the project.  It
 
should be an attractive possibility to the right publisher, since the rights
 
are free, having been returned to the authors.
 
I have here the two copies of the book which you were good enough to send to
 
me.  I will hold on to them until I receive your instructions about returning
 
them or sending them elsewhere.
 
Thank you again for all your help, and best wishes,
 
Carol Orr

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
It was a pleasure meeting you at the folk meeting in
 
Bowling Green this spring.  During the intervening time I
 
had time to examine the book we discussed--Step It Down. 
I am favorably impressed by the book and would like
 
to look further into the possibility of our reissuing it.
 
As I recall our conversation about the book, you had the
 
full rights to it, including those of Bessie Jones.
 I
 
did notice that the music selections were copyrighted by
 
the Ludlow Music Company.
 Do you have those clearances
 
also?  Or would we need to secure permission from that
 
company to reproduce the music?  Could you tell me how
 
many copies were sold of the harper edition and when it
 
went out of print?
 
I would be grateful for any further considerations
 
you might have regarding the reprint.  What do you think
 
about the relative appeal of cloth vs. paper editions?
 
I hope that we can work out an arrangement for this and
 
shall look forward to hearing from you.
 
Sincerely,

On the assumption that we would reissue the book in a

Dear Bess:
 
JBANA CHAMPA:GN AND DH CADO
 
November 15,  1985
 
It was wonderful seeing you--if too much from a
'far--at the AFS meeting.
 
Have you had any luck locating copies of the two Laws books?  As I under-
stand, NATIVE AMERICAN BALLADRY is still in print from the University of
 
Texas Press,  for $17.50 paperback.
 As for AMERICAN BALLADRY FROM BRITISH
 
BROADSIDF3
,  I may have misled you, thinking this had been published by the
 
University of Pennsylvania Press.
 The book was published in Philadelphia,
 
but not by Penn.
 Apparently it is out of print, since it's not listed
 
in the 1984-85 BOOKS IN PRINT.
 I
'm not sure where you could put your hands
 
on a copy, unless you simply put out the word that you're looking for one
 
and then hope for the best.
 I wonder if Penn would be interested in reprint-
ing this; perhaps I
'll mention it to the next editor from there I see.
 
Coffin's BRITISH TRADITIONAL BALLAD IN NORTH AMERICA is still available
 
from Texas, of course,  in that recent update that Roger Renwick prepared.
 
At the meeting I had hoped to have a chance to talk with you again about
 
STEP IT DOWN.
 Last time we discussed this,  I believe you were planning
 
to send me maybe 10 to 20 names of people who could advise on the book's
 
usefulness, especially for class use.
 Gene Bluestein is an obvious consult-
ant, of course.
 I
'd very much appreciate your passing on other names,
 
as your time permits.
 Would you consider adding some kind of afterword?
 
Obviously,  this would be better than trying to revise the central part
 
of the book, which would just increase the costs and eventual price.
 For
 
VOICES FROM THE MOUNTAINS,  for instance, Guy and Candie Carawan brought
 
the biblio-discography up to date, but didn't change the heart of the book;
 
we simply shot what was there.
 If your review file for STEP IT DOWN is
 
handy,  I
'd appreciate seeing copies of those reviews, especially those
 
that could be used in promotion of a reprint.
 
Bess,  I
'd be delighted to have the chance to include this book in our P
r
tisic
 
in American L
ife series.
 It would be good to have Bessie represented there.
 
And STEP IT DOWN would provide an obvious and useful complement to our
 
other Bessie book,  though that one, as you know,  is not in the music series.
 
Why don't you drop me a note when your schedule permits and let me know
 
when I might expect to hear more from you about this reprint possibility?
 
I
'd love to work with you on this,  for your sake and for Bessie's.
 
Take care, and write soon.
 
Regards,
 
JI

To Whom it May Concern:
 
It's a special pleasure for me to  endorse the idea of publishing
 
Step It  Down in a paper  edition.  I have  never been  able  to
 
understand why it was not done long ago. It is a book that spans
 
disciplines,  including  anthropology,  folklore,  music,  dance,
 
black l
iterature, and women's studies. I have been using the book
 
s
ince  its  publication  in  1972  and  I can  say  without  hesitation
 
that having it in paper will be a great advantage for me and my
 
students.
 
Let me emphasize a few  of the reasons for making the book more
 
ava i
lable.
 To  begin  with,  it is  in  the  great  tradition  of  the
 
Lomaxes' contributions to our understanding of American folklore
 
and folksong.  One  of their great insights is the importance  of
 
being close to the folk subjects who are being observed.  In this
 
case the co l
laboration between Bess Lomax Hawes and Bessie Jones
 
results in the most remarkable comprehension of what seems on the
 
surface a s
imple set of games and play activities.  Both authors
 
are supremely aware of the deep significance that underlies these
 
activities  and  the  success  of the  book  resides  in  their  ability
 
to  make a
ll of us understand it as well.
 
At the same t
ime, this is a book which joins theory and practice
 
in  a unique  way.  There are few  studies so  well grounded in an
 
undertanding of folklore and anthropological principles.  But one
 
rarely has an opportunity to see how the ideas and speculations
 
of a book can be tested immediately in the practical applications
 
which are provided.  The repertoire of songs and games that the
 
book preserves is in itself one of the study's great virtues;  but
 
one sees also that Bess Hawes and Bessie Jones are great teachers
 
and that they have the  skills that  make it possible to pass the
 
materials  on  to  others.
 We  not  only  get  these  important
 
materials; we learn how and why they work.
 
Fina l
ly,  it's  important  to  emphasize  the  skill and  courage  of
 
both  authors.
 The  book  is  so  smooth  and  seamless  in  its
 
construction that one has no sense of the great obstacles which
 
emerge in the process of such a collaboration between a scholar
 
and  a folk  subject  of  Bessie  Jones's  stature.  Few  folklorists
 
a
llow themselves to get as  close to their  materials or subjects.
 
It is  always  safer  to  work  from  a distance  and  never take
 
chances.  The  collaboration  here  has  resulted in  the  fullest
 
interchange,
 marked  by  Bess  Hawes's  revelation  of  crucial
 
meanings in  the  material  and  Bessie  Jones's  almost  endless
 
unravelling of song and game repertoire.
 
For these and  other compelling reasons,  it  would be  a great
 
service  to  the  fields  of  interest  as  well  as  the  general
 
readership to make Step It Down more easily available.

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
Reviewing my projects here near the end of one year,
 
I notice that we had not heard anything further from you
 
regarding the reissue of STEP IT DOWN  and I am naturally
 
curious about your disposition toward our proposal for
 
bringing out the book in paperback format.
 
I would like to do the book and would be grateful
 
if you could let me know how we stand on it.
 
With best wishes for the holiday season and for the
 
year to come,
 
Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
I wish to inform you that our Editorial Board at its
 
meeting last Friday approved our reprinting of Step It Down.
 
I am very pleased that this has received formal en-
dorsement, though I had no doubts of its doing so, and I
 
am expecting the book will be a good title for our growing
 
list in folk studies.
 It will appear in out fall catalog
 
and books should be available for the folklore meeting.
 
I shall draw up a formal agreement for your signature
 
and will send it to you shortly.
 In the meantime, I would
 
like for you to secure any clearances that may be required,
 
especially with regard to the music, and to forward copies
 
for our files.  We should also have documentation of Bessie
 
Jones's assignment of rights to you.
 
I am enclosing a short information and would appreciate
 
your completing it and returning it to me fairly soon.
 
Let me take this occasion to ask that, if you hear of
 
any promising projects that might result in books, I would
 
be most grateful for word about them, and especially if you
 
could nudge them in our direction.
 
Thanks for letting us have the opportunity of reprinting
 
the book.
 I think that it will be a good production.
 
With best wishes,
 
Sincerely,
 
Wm. Jerome Crouch

Dear Ms. Orchard,
 
I hope you enjoy the book.
 I think i
t has held up pretty well over
 
the years.  After you've had a chance to go over it, you can reach me
 
by telephone at either 202/682-5449 (
my work number) or at 703/243-2271
 
(
my apartment in Arlington).
 
I have already spoken, by the way, to Ludlow Music who hold copyright
 
on the musical transcriptions.  They tell me they will approve re-publication
 
in paperback without charge.  My a co-author, Mrs. Bessie Jones, passed
 
away several years ago.
 Befvre she died she signed a permission statement
 
allowing me to negotiate for re-publication of the book.  After I have
 
heard from you, I will get in touch with her heirs and get their agreement.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomat,H

I understand that you are considering reprintinq Step
 
It D
m
 
f
lessie Jones and Bess Lomax Haves  (originally published b
rp u
 
& Row)  as a Brown Thrasher paperback.  I am delighted to hear this,
 
and want you to know that this proposal has my stronge st support.
 
When the book came out in 1972 1 immediately ordered a copy,  kncw--
'
 
ing that it was one of the few publications devoted to Georgia
 
folklore. After reading the book,  however,  I realized that its
 
significance goes beyond that simple fact,  for it is the first
 
book-length treatment of Georgia folk culture by a trained social
 
scientist/folklorist,  and one of the very few studies of child
 
ren's folklore in the South. The only other remotely comparable
 
book that I'm aware of is May Justus's The Complete Peddler's
  
Pack (University of Tennessee Press,  1967),  and it is merely a
 
compendium of songs and rhymes remembered by the author,  without
 
the descriptive,  contextual,  and attitudinal information that s
 
enriches Step It Down. (The two books are hardly competitors,
 
for Peddler's Pack represents the white culture of Tennessee's
 
Smoky Mountains,  while Step It Down derives from the black co m-
munity of Dawson,  Terrell County,  in southwest Georgia.)
 
Perhaps Step It Down's greatest contribution is its revela ion et
 
the importance of traditional play activities in preparing child-
ren for their roles as social beings,  a theme found mainly in le
 
accessible  (i.e.,  more jargon-laden)  studies.  Further,  the Jones
 
Haves collaboration is one of the precious few informant-orient
 
Colklor e studies, utilizing an approach that goes to the human
 
istic heart of the folklore discipline by focusing on the role
 
traditions in an individual's life  (I suspect it provided a mod
 
f r a later study of an Ozark Mountain folksinger and her reper-
toire, Almeda Riddle's Book of Ballads by Ro er Ahri)L
;,
 
collaboration with the informant).
 
while Step It Down is excellent as it stands,  I believe it C OUl d
 
be enhanced by the addition of photographs of Bessie Jones and  t
 
'eorqia Sea Island Singers actually playing  the q.. r
r's,
 if  s' .
 
2
 
urvive from the California teaching  session,,
, . These would help
 r
'
 
ovoke the spirit of the activity,  and illustrate some of the
 
which may be difficult to visualize from the written description
 
(
it's possible that such photos were excluded from the original
 
edition as a cost consideration,  but it may be possible to inclu c
 
a limited number at the end of the reprint edition at a nominal
 
cost).  I'd also recommend that Ms. Hawes write a brief afterword
 
to bring her subject up to dates  Bessie Jones's being awarded a
 
National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Art:',
 
her death,  and the legacy she left to her adopted community in tdc
 
form of the Georgia Sea Island  Festival.
 
Step It Down opens a window to the joyousness afforded by a rich fol;--
lore legacy in the otherwise impoverished black life of the rural
 
South.  It is a celebration of one woman's conquest,  through her spirit
 
and traditions,  of an oppressive economic and social environment.  To
 
the best of my recollection,  Step It Down was not originally marketed
 
as a book of interest to Georgia and Southern readers,  so there Cou1
 
he a new untapped market for the reprint never reached in the init
1
 
promotional efforts.  If a preface is called for , I'd li k e to  see i
t
 
written by Brian Sutton-Smith of the University of Pennsylvania,  o
:
 
o f  the world's leading authorities on children's folklore,  who is
 
most capable of placing the book within the framework of tb
os fi(
-" '
 
(
and who is already familiar with it,  judging by Ms.  Haw
C  a
 
1edgments).
 
wish you the greatest success in this endeavor,  and if 1 can
 c
 
of any assistance in helpiric to c
Tet  this excellent book back ir on r

do not hesitate to ask.

Dear Mr. Crouch,
 
I expect all authors are maddening, but I fear I may go down in your mind
 
as the absolute ultimate in maddening-ness, if there is such a wor t
 (
I'm
 
sure there is such a thing.)  There have been several reasons for my long
 
silences.  I have been out of town for several long and exhausting business
 
trips.  I have been i
ll with a lengthy, debilit ting and energy-sapping flu.
 
I have had an unusually heavy accumulation of business that has left me always
 
promising myself that I will take care of my own personal affairs when I have
 
the time, and i
t never comes.
 
But the real reason for my apparent foot-dragging i
s that I have run into
 
substantial difficulties in clearing the rights to reprint the book, and I have
 
not had time orenergy to devote to straightening these difficulties out.  I
t
 
turns out that my co-author, Bessie Smith Jones, did not leave a properly
 
witnessed will, and her estate has not yet been settled, nor is it clear just
 
who has the authority to settle it.  I have been in touch withseveral of her
 
surviving relatives and find that there are varying points of view and contending
 
interests to satisfy.
 
That is why I have not signed the contract you sent me.  It appears to me
 
that I will have to investigate Georgia probate law and probably hire a Georgia
 
lawyer to negotiate with the family (
who do not get on swimmingly with each other)
 
before I can take any serious steps towards re-publication.  In my opinion, it
 
will require a personal journey to Georgia which I cannot undertake before the
 
end of the summer.  I am not sure even then what I can *tgotiate.  Although you
 
and I might feel that the possible sums involved are inconsequential, this is
 
not the way the issue seems to Mrs. Jones' putative heirs.  I think it only fair
 
to say that several family members intimated to me that they hope the matter
 
will be handled locally so that their own interests can be kept better account of,
 
as they see it.
 
I am therefore returning the contract and other materials you had sent to me
 
unsigned.  I do not feel that I am ready to proceed with reprinting this book
 
this fall, and I am truly sorry if I have misled you.  As it is now, I need some
 
time to negotiate the rights to everyone's satisfaction, besides, I need some time
 
to consider whether or not the book requires some re-editing or a new introduction
 
or some pictures, and I need some time to reflect upon where and how i
t might best
 
be marketed and where it may find its eventual home.  I think I may look into the
 
situation in Georgia  itself as my "co-authors" seem to want; that may prove to be
 
the only way to make them feel secure.
 
T
 certainly owe you an earnest apology which I hereby give.  I am
 
extremely grateful for your attentive interest in the book.  The errors in
 
judgment have been entirely mine.  When I find I am able to proceed, I shall
 
certainly get in touch with you once again, and perhaps some day we will be
 
able to work together on this or some other project.

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
(,

.
 
It was good to talk with you again yesterday afternoon.  This letter is
 
to confirm the news I conveyed on the phone.  At their meeting on June 6
,
 
the members of our editorial board unanimously (
and enthusiastically)
 
approved publication of Step It Down. We are delighted to be one step
 
closer to republishing the book in our Brown Thrasher reprint series.
 
As we agreed, I
'm enclosing a draft of a publication agreement for
 
reprinting the book.  After you have resolved the situation with Mrs.
 
Jones's heirs, we can modify the contract as needed and draw up a final
 
agreement.
 Please call if you have questions about any aspect of the
 
agreement.
 I will be out of the office June 16-24, but can be reached
 
easily after that.
 
I
'm glad that we are in agreement about the need for only a brief preface
 
or afterword that will give some information about the later years of
 
Mrs. Jones's career and that you are willing to write that piece.
 I
'm
 
glad,  too,  that you are willing to explore the possibility of including
 
some photographs.
 I think a shot of Mrs. Jones teaching children would
 
be ideal for the jacket of the new edition.
 
Please let me know if there is anything I can do to be helpful in sorting
 
out the situation with the heirs.  In the meantime, I
'm asking our order
 
department to send you three complimentary copies of Drums and Shadows so
 
that you and the Jones family can see an example of one of our most
 
recent Brown Thrasher books.
 
All good wishes,
 
Karen Orchard

 OUT-OF-PRINT CONTINGENCY
 
The Publisher shall have the foregoing rights so long as it keeps
 
the Work in print, subject to the following:
 
1
.
 If the Work goes out of print and the Publisher fails to
 
reprint within six (
6) months after receipt of written demand from the
 
Author to do so,  the Author may terminate this agreement by written
 
notice, which termination shall occur thirty (
30) days after the
 
Publisher's receipt of such notice.
 
2
.  The Work shall not be deemed out of print so long as it is
 
available for sale either from stock from the Publisher's warehouse or in
 
the field.
 
3.  Upon such termination all rights granted hereunder except as
 
provided for in this paragraph shall revert to the Author, and the
 
Publisher shall be under no further obligation to the Author except that
 
all royalties under this agreement shall be paid as they become due.
 
VI.  ADVANCE
 
The Publisher shall pay the Author an advance of $500.00 which
 
shall be applied by the Publisher against the royalties to be paid by the
 
Publisher to the Author and which shall be payable upon the signing of
 
this agreement.
 
VII.
 ROYALTIES
 
Except in cases hereinafter provided, the Publisher shall pay the
 
Author, on all copies sold at full price less an allowable discount,
 
royalty of 10 percent on the clothbound copies and 7 percent on the
 
paperbound copies.  The said royalty shall be computed on the Press's net
 
receipts.  The Press shall render a statement of account annually, as of
 
June 30 of each year, and shall make settlements in cash with three (3)
 
months after the date of the statement.
 No royalty shall be paid on any
 
copies sold at or below manufacturing cost.
 Payments amounting to less
 
that $
15.00 are normally held until royalties in excess of this amount
 
are accumulated.  Should the Author receive an overpayment of royalty
 
arising from copies reported sold but subsequently returned, the
 
Publisher may deduct such overpayment from any other sums due the Author,
 
it being understood, however,  that the term "overpayment" does not apply
 
to an unearned advance specifically agreed to as applying to one book.

VIII.
 COMPLIMENTARY COPIES
  
Upon publication the Author shall receive 5 complimentary copies
 
of the Publisher's cloth edition and 10 complimentary copies of the
 
paperbound edition.  The author may purchase additional copies of either
 
edition at a discount of 40 percent off list price plus shipping charges.
 
XIV.  BINDING ON HEIRS AND ASSIGNS
  
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
 
the heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns of both parties and
 
shall be governed by the law of the United States of America and the
 
State of Georgia, both as to interpretation and performance.
 It may be
 
assigned as a whole (
but not in part) by either party with the advance
 
written consent of the other.
 
Made this day at Athens, Georgia.

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
I tried to reach you by telephone at your office
 
today and learn that you have been away on leave.
 So I
 
shall write with the hope you will find this letter on your
 
return.
 
I am naturally curious to learn whether you have
 
been successful in resolving the situation with Bessie
 
Jones's family regarding STEP IT DOWN.
 I trust that some
 
satisfactory agreement may have been reached that will
 
permit the reissue of the book.
 
But I am also hopeful that our press can do the
 
reissue, as we have discussed earlier.
 If the family has
 
any question about our plans or capabilities, I would like
 
to get in touch with them to see what we can do to
 
demonstrate that our press is active in this area and that
 
we can publish the book in a manner that will reflect
 
favorably on all concerned.  For example, two of our
 
Afro-American authors, Juliet Walker of the University of
 
Illinois and Ruth Polk Patterson of Little Rock, Arkansas,
 
who have published family histories with us, would,  I am
 
confident, be happy to write letters that would strongly
 
support our publishing endeavors.
 
As you can see,  I do want STEP IT DOWN for our
 
list, and I anticipate learning its situation.
 I shall be
 
at the AFS meeting in Baltimore and hope that we can talk
 
more about the project there.
 
With best wishes,
 
Sincerely,

World Music Press is an independent publishing house
 
dedicated to providing top quality multicultural music
 
resources for teachers. In addition to our own publications,
 
we are tracking down out-of-print classics to buy all
 
remaining copies of and also obtain the reprint rights for.

concerning the book STEP IT DOWN b C
y
 essie Jones ançi Bess
 
Lomax Hawes, published originally   Har er_-&--Ro
in 1972,
 
and out of print now for several years.
 
I would like to acquire the reprint rights for World
 
Music Press, but if that is not possible, I would still like
 
to know who is reprinting the book, so I may distribute it to
 
my steady customers in music education who see this book as a
 
gem and feel, as I do, that it is terrible to have it out of
 
print for so long.
 
I have enclosed my most recent catalogue, to give you an
 
idea of my orientation and projects. Please reply at your
 
earliest convenience using the enclosed envelope.  Thank you.

Dear Ms. Hawes,
 
We received the attached letter from Judith Cook Tucker
 
of the World Music Press regarding the possibility of
 
reprinting STEP IT DOWN.
 
I spoke to Judith Cook Tucker and she is very excited
 
about this book.
 I think the letter speaks for itself.
 
I doubt that she will be able to offer much of an advance
 
(if any), but there will be some royalties and the
 
assurance that your book has found a good home.
 
I have not tried to contact the Estate of Bessie Jones
 
yet.
 I thought I
'd try you first.  Mrs. Tucker is very
  
anxious to hear your thoughts so please let me know
 
whether or not you are interested.
 
I look forward to hearing from you.
 
cerely,

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
I am pleased that we had the chance to talk about
 
STEP IT DOWN at the recent folklore meeting.  As you know I
 
am disappointed at the decision to publish the book with the
 
University of Georgia Press.  At the same time, I can
 
appreciate the reasoning behind that decision.
 So I wish
 
you and everyone else success with publication of the book.
 
I feel confident that in the long term the new printing will
 
do well.
 
I do hope that you will keep our press in mind for
 
any subsequent work you might do in American folklore.  We
 
are planning to continue efforts to build a strong list in
 
this area, and I can assure you that a project of yours
 
would receive our best attention.
 Therefore, I hope that I
 
may hear from you at some future time.

Herewith at long last the contract for reprinting Step It Down together with a
 
proposed introduction to the re-issue.  If you feel the latter needs editing,
 
I am used to being edited and don't take-offense (
though I may bleed a little
 
quietly).
 
I am still looking for pictures and hope some good ones will eventually reach
 
you.  Mrs. Jones wasn't very photogenic somehow, a quality she shared with me,
 
but I will keep looking for some that look vaguely like her.
 
I am going on the assumption that the matter of increasing royalties will be
 
written into the contract as we discussed it over the phone, also that my
 
request that Douglass and Frankie Quimby receive copies at cost will be honored.
 
You will probably also be relieved to learn that all royalties should be sent
 
to me.  I will donate them in Bessie's name to appropriate causes, such as the
 
ongoing Georgia Sea Island Festival and the Zora Neale Hurston Memorial Fund.
 
Best wishes, and please let me know how matters evolve and what the potential
 
publication deadline may turn out to be.

Dear l
is.  l
awes:
 
A couple of weeks ago I had the privilege of meeting
 
Frankie and Doug Quimby.  They gave an assembly at
 
our school.  I also attended a workshop given by them
 
at Sam Houston State University.  The Quimbies were
 
with Bessie Jones and the Sea Island Singers.
 
As Bessie Jones' book Step It Down is no longer in
 
print, there are a whole passel of music teachers here
 
in Texas and I am sure elsewhere, who would like to
 
see it printed again.
 What a thrill it must have been
 
to know Bessie Jones as you did!
 
W e  are writing Frankie and Doug hoping t
o hook tnem for
 
a return visit to our Humble Schools.
 
Sincerely,
 
Fat Herbert

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
After reading the workshop report in Encounter, (
the Kodaly
 
Educators of Texas Magazine), that your book, Step It Down, is out
 
of print I was so disappointed.
 I have heard teachers at Kodaly
 
workshops talk of this book and wanted a copy.
 I have written the
 
Quimbys several times, but had not received a book even though I
 
sent an order.
 I even sent money by a friend to buy a copy at the
 
Sam Houston University Workshop held by the Quimbys.
 I am most
 
anxious to get this book and urge you to consider reprinting this
 
book.
 There are many others who feel the same.
 
Thank you for bringing this music to our attention.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Mrs.  Hawes:
 
I read in the Kodaly Envoy that if you hear from enough
 
of us Kodaly educators,  you may consider reprinting  "Step it
 
Down."
 
We have been desolate since it's been out of print,
 
having depended on it for our inner-city Boston model and
 
practice teaching schools program.
 Also our Black Materials
 
course depends on it and we have always required the first
 
year students in our summer session to buy it,  as well as
 
our academic year students.
 
I feel it's the best book in its field that was ever
 
written and I' m sure there would be a market for it if you
 
were to reprint it.
 PLEASE--we need it!

PREFACE TO THE PAPERBACK EDITION
 
As I look back over the original edition of Step It Down it seems to
 
me that it should stand as it was written fifteen years ago, especially now
 
that I can no longer consult my co-author.  Bessie Smith Jones passed away of
 
leukemia on September 4
, 1984.  She was 83 years old, and her health had been
 
failing for several years.
 
In the last decade of her life, she had won many honors.  She taught
 
for a year at Yale University through a Duke Ellington Fellowship.  She performed
 
extensively during the summer-long Bicentennial Festival of American Folklife
 
on the National Mall, and her work in the Children's Program there was videotaped
 
by the Smithsonian Institution.  A portion of the numerous interviews she gave
 
throughout her lifetime detailing her reminiscences was published in a book
 
titled For The Ancestors (
Bessie Smith Jones and John Stewart, authors;
 
University of Illinois Press, 1982); and two additional recordings of her singing
 
with various assemblages of children in eastern schools were released under the
 
titles, So Glad I
'm Here and Step It Down, (Rounder Records 2015 and 8004).  In
 
1982, she received a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for
 
the Arts, one of the first eminent folk artists so honored by the United States
 
Government.
 
On hearing of her death,  Alan Lomax, who had first recorded her in the
 
1940's said, "She was on fire to teach America.  In my heart, I call her the
 
Mother Courage of American Black traditions."  And Professor Willie Ruff, with
 
whom she had worked at Yale, commented, "The woman was a metaphor for the
 
continuity of Black tradition."  Her great-r jce, Frankie Quimby, put it another
 
way, "Miss Bessie always said she wanted to live on.  That's what she wanted, she
 
wanted to live on."
 
-2-
She will live on, of course, in the memories of the thousands of people
 
she touched with the blazing force of her personality.  And perhaps the re-issuance
 
of Step It Down will help keep her alive for generations of children and teachers
 
yet to come.  But it must be written somewhere that her work with children and
 
her educational philosophy, complex and detailed as it was, was only
 
part of what she had to offer.  The songs in this book, for example,
 
less than a twentieth of her total repertoire of the finest songs of
 
a small
 
are perhaps
 
the Black
 
tradition, songs that were so profound, true and compelling that they were
 
adopted immediately by the Georgia Sea Island Singers and sung on concert stages
 
across the country.  There are more books to be written about Bessie Smith Jones,
 
more explorations that should be mounted into the depth
 
her art, her determination to keep the faith with those
 
keep on singing the songs the way they were supposed to
 
and range of her experience,
 
who came before her, to
 
be sung.  We have not yet
 
begun to learn all that she had to teach nor listened to all that she had to say.
 
This life-loving, deep-rooted, confident, joyful, adventurous and
 
astonishing woman sang in public for the last time in August, 1984 at the
 
Georgia Sea Island Festival on St. Simon's, an annual celebration that she had
 
helped start and that has since been continued in her memory.  She sat in a great
 
chair on the stage throughout the long afternoon, I was told, with her island
 
friends and their children around her, dozing off occasionally but rousing
 
herself to listen and approve the performances.  When it came her turn, she needed
 
to be helped to the microphone, but she sang one of her favorite songs, a song
 
that will always be identified with her, an old-time spiritual learned from
 
her fore-parents, "So Glad I
'm Here."
 
This book is dedicated to her memory.

Until now, B

Ambitious i

The Sound and t
he Fury and L

n August, a
nd
 
e
valuations o
f Ransom's, Tate's and Penn Warren's
 
c

Douglass s
hows how Bergson e

American writers' s
