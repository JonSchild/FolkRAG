September 21, 1943, letter from B.A. Botkin to Willis
Laurence James
September 21, 1943 Mr. Willis Laurence James 39 Chestnut Street, S. W. Atlanta,
Georgia
Dear Mr. James:
Thank you for your letter of September 15th. I am looking forward to receiving some of the
“Waterfront Songs” from your collection. I was interested in having them placed on deposit
here, and possibly having some of them recorded, if they are still available. The Library
has no folk song publication program other than our record albums but I may have some
suggestions.
Could you write me more in detail about the recording facilities at Atlanta University and
the available material?
With best wishes,
Sincerely yours, B. A. Botkin Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Song
