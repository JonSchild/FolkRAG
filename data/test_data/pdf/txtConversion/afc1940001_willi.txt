Willie Riley It was on one Sunday morning all in the month of spring, The little feathered song birds
in chorus they did sing; The primrose and the daisies [bespangled?] every lawn, And 'twas in an
arbo I espied my fair Coolin Bawn. I stood awhile amazed, quite struck with surprise; On her with
rapture gazed, while from her bright eyes She shot such killing glances, away my heart was drawn;
She ravished all my senses, my fair Coolin Bawn. I smilingly addressed her, "Hail, matchless fair
maid, With grief you have oppressed me, and I am much afraid, Except you cure my anguish which
now is in its dawn, You'll cause my sad overthrow, my fair Coolin Bawn. Then it's with a gentle
smile she replied unto me, "I cannot tyrannize, dear Willie, over thee; My father he is wealthy and
gives severe commands, But if you'll just but gain his favor, I'll be your Coolin Bawn." In rapture I
embraced her[;?] we swore eternal love That naught should separate us except the powers above.
I hired with her father and left my home and land, That with rapture I might gaze on my fair Coolin
Bawn. One evening as her father and I walked out alone[,?] I asked him for his daughters saying,
"Sir, it is well known I have a well stocked farm, five hundred pounds in hand That I'll share with your
daughter, my fair Coolin Bawn." Her father being angry most scornfully did frown, Said [he?] , "Here
is your wages; now, sir, depart the town." Increasing still his anger, he bade me quick be gone[,?]
For none but a rich squire can wed my Coolin Bawn. I went unto his daughter and told her my sad
tale; Oppressed with grief and anguish we both did weep and wail. Says she, "My dearest Willie, the
thought I can't withstand, That in sorrow you should leave me here, your dear Coolin Bawn."
48 [32?] [2/64?] 16
Then a horse I did get ready all in the silent night; Having no other remedy we quickly took our
flight[,?] And then by hill and valley we quickly took our way. O'er lofty rugged mountains we traveled
night and day. 2 2 of 4 Willie Riley Our steed not used to saddle grew weary of the pace, But still
we urged him onward, for none could take his place. The horse he chanced to stumble, and throw
us both along Which confused and sorely bruised me and my dear Coolin Bawn. Again we quickly
mounted and soon we rode away; Through shady groves and valleys we traveled night and day, But
her father quick pursued us with his well chosen band, And I was overtaken with my dear Coolin
AFCCC-WILLI http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_willi
Bawn. They hurried me to prison, my hands and feet they bound, And like some cruel murderer they
chained me to the ground, But this hard cruel treatment most cheerfully I'll stand, Ten thousand
deaths I'd suffer for my dear Coolin Bawn. My Coolin Bawn was taken right back to Sligo town,
Into her father's castle to face his angry frown. Then locked in close confinement there to repent
the deed, Twelve days on broad and water my love was forced to feed. ** He lay in Sligo prison,
a dungeon dark and cold. No words of love to cheer him, he had a heart of gold. If in the court of
justice his Coolin Bawn appear, And she would be his witness, young Riley had no fear. The jailer's
son to Riley goes and thus to him did say, "Oh, get up Willie Riley, you must appear this day[,?] For
at the bar of justice, young Riley, you must stand, For nothing but the stealing of your dear Coolin
Bawn.' The jailer's son to Riley said, "I found this on the strand, A note from yonder castle penned
by a lady's hand. Though I fear the squire's anger[,] you never can withstand, I am afraid you'll suffer
dearly for your dear Coolin Bawn. "This is the news, young Riley, last night that I did hear[:?] The
lady's oath will hang you, or else will sat you clear." "If that be so," says Riley, "her pleasure I will
stand, Her voice so dear once more to hear of Riley's Coolin Bawn." Now Willie's dressed from top
to toe all in a suit of green, His hair hangs o'er his shoulders most glorious to be seen. He's tall and
straight and comely as any could be found, He's fit for Folger's daughter was she heiress to a crown.
"Oh gentlemen," Squire Folliard said, "with pity look on me; This villain came among us to disgrace
our family, And by his base contrivances this villainy was planned. If I don't get satisfaction, I'll quit
this Ireland. 3 3 of 4 Willie Riley "Good Lord, he stole her jewels, her diamonds and gold rings, Gold
watch and silver buckles and many a precious thing Which cost me in bright guineas more than five
hundred pounds, And I surely will go crazy if Riley hangs around." The judge then said, "This lady
being in her tender youth, If Riley has deluded her, she must declare the truth, And in this court of
justice, we witness here today This law in dear old Ireland your father to obey." Then in the crowded
courtroom the lady took the stand; ( She wore )[xxx?] a red rose in her hair, a ring shone on her
hand. The judge then said, 'Now lady, please place your right hand here, And speak the truth, the
whole truth," the judge said loud and clear.
[32 34 2/69 18?]
The lady in a sweet voice said, "The fault lies all on me; 'Twas for my sake he ran away and left his
place you see. With tears of love I begged him, I could not set him free, I loved him out of measure,
which wrought our destiny. "He never stole my jewels, I swear by all above, But there is one I gave
him, in token of true love. The ring I gave you, Riley, I intend for you to wear, With thirty locket
diamonds well sat in silver fair. "Dear Riley, when you're banished and far away from me, To live
in some far distant land, far, far across the sea, This ring I gave give[-?] you, Riley, wear on your
right hand; Think of my broken heart, love, when in a foreign land. "If you have got them, Riley, pray
send them home to me, They're poor compared to that true heart which I have given thee. My poor
love will go with you wherever you may roam, And they may keep my body here, your heart will
be my home." Then up spoke the noble fox who at a table he stood by, "Gentlemen of the jury, for
AFCCC-WILLI http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_willi
[?] justice I reply. To hang a man for love is foul murder you may see. So save the life of Riley and
banished let him be. "The lady's oath has cleared him as all the jury know. I suggest *1 to you, your
honor[,?][*** *1] that you let the villain go. Put him on some sailing vessel soon standing out to sea,
Bound for some lonely island, and set young Riley free." Young Riley sailed at dawning bound for the
Spanish Main. He made a vow in seven years that he'd return again, In sorrow he embraced her, no
other would he love; She promised to be faithful and true as heaven above. 4 4 of 4 Willie Riley The
vessel that he sailed in was one of a convoy That sailed across the ocean, 'twas called Lady del Roy,
Poor broken hearted Willie stood gazing at the land, There he had left his heart and his dear Coolin
Bawn.
They ran away together a second time and were married; when her father heard this he relented.
* Soon as her father heard it his heart it did relent, Saying, "For my behavior I sorely do repent, But
now you shall be happy with me in Sligo town, A portion I will give you of thirty thousand pounds." *
