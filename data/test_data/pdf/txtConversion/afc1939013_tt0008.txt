RECORD 2
B-1 “A Sweet Little Woodmouse” A Conch song learned in the Bahamas, sung by Wilbur
Roberts, Riviera, Florida, January 16, 1940. Recorded by Stetson Kennedy and Robert
Cook.
A SWEET LITTLE WOODMOUSE
A sweet little woodmouse Once made a snug nest In a cornfield Which belong to good
farmer West.
Where everything grew That was pleasant to eat From beans, oats, and barley To
beautiful wheat.
At the door of his house On a carpet of green A woodmouse all set And no way to be
seen.
This is truly A very fine cornfield, said he And doubtless was planted On purpose for me.
(Repeat)
He nibbled the corn As it lay on the ground Just as bright as a lark And he sleeped for
sound.

THE WOODMOUSE
So safe in his nest Far from two bulks of eyes Not worried by dogs Nor molested by boys.
Farmer West was the man Saw him day after day But never attempted To drive him away.

For said he, there's a-plenty And God gave it all. A little we spare For a creature so small.
