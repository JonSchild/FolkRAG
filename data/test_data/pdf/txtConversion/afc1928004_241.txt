HIC AL SKETCH. 
M ESSRS. SHERIDAN and M ACK are natives of Providence, It. I., and first 
appeared on the public stage as Double Clog Dancers under the assumed 
name of the Sliter Brothers. 
The company with which they first appeared 
was Frank Forrest's Minstrels, and their cl,but was made at Pawtucket, 
It. I., on April 12, 1864. 
This monster organization, consisting of the only 
Ned Turner, Harry Butler, Dick Prior, and others, concluded, after a 
three months' tour, to lay up for the balance of the manager's existence, 
so the Sliter Brothers returned to their homes crowned with honors, and 
for a 
while were the lions of Providence. 
Their next attempt, was with 
Chadwick and Webb's Minstrels, who, after running two consecutive 
weeks, suddenly retired— the managers having made reputation enough, 
went into some other business for money. The Sliters, however, not be-
ing without some little talent, met a 
good Samaritan in the person of 
Johnny Whiting, the Comedian, who took them to New York, and got 
them an opening at Butler's American Theatre, 444 Broadway 
here they 
adopted their real names—Sheridan and Mack—and advanced very rap-
idly in their profession. 
Their next move was to Wood's Minstrels, 514 
Broadway. Tony Pastor and Sam Sharpley, about to start a 
travelling 
company, engaged them. They remained with tins company till sonic 
time after their opening at 201 Bowery, and were then engaged with Mor-
ris Bros. and Trowbridge's Minstrels, Boston, Mass. They remained 
with this company over two years, and having made rapid advances in 
their business, were engaged by R. M. Hooley, of the Brooklyn and Sev-
enth street, Philadelphia, Opera Houses. 
At the opening of the great Tammany Hall, New York, they were en-
gaged, and as there were no black face acts permitted, they there adopted 
a 
new line of business—doing song and dances and character songs in 
white faces. 
Messrs. SHERIDAN and M ACK are the originals of this line of 
business, and to-day stand at the head of their profession. 
They have also 
played two engagements in San Francisco, Cal. ( where they made an en-
viable reputation), under the management of Thos. Maguire, the Pioneer 
Manager of California. They then joined Messrs. Maguire and Emerson's 
Minstrels, 720 Broadway, New York, where they were received nightly in 
their original specialties with unbounded enthusiasm, and acknowledged 
by the press and public as par excellence. 
June 15th, 1873, they associated themselves with Mr. Sam Sharpley, and 
travelled through the principal Eastern and Western cities, the company 
being known as Sharpley, Sheridan and Mack's Combination. During a 
portion of the season, Charles H. Day, the well-known showman, was 
connected with the company, at which time be conceived the plan of or-
ganizing that which would indeed be a grand combination. 
Some six 
months were spent in negotiations with performers, and the engraving of 
the most elaborate posters ever used by a 
hall show in any country, when. 
Sheridan, Mack and Day's Company commenced their travels at New 
Orleans, Louisiana, after the largest expenditure in outfit over made by a 
sthgle management. From the outset, despite " bard times" and politi-
cal and local excitements, the troupe has been wondrously prosperous— 
no little of said success being attributed to the talent and popularity of 
SHERIDAN and M ACK.

B FLAT COLORED BAND. 
Sung by ED. FRENCH. 
BEHOLD in me a 
man of shape, 
Of color, air, and style, 
With my regimental garments on, 
I 
am sure to win your smile; 
The base-drum is my forte, you see; 
I 
am the finest in the land, 
I 
am leader in the infantry, 
In the B 
Flat Colored Band. 
CHORE'S. 
That B 
Flat Colored Band, 
That B 
Flat Colored Band; 
We can play more tunes 
For four weak coons, 
Than any in the land, 
One day we played out in the street, 
The President was in town ; 
My girl stood on the balcony, 
As we came mal.ching down ; 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
And then I 
almost choked ; 
I 
hit the drum, made one home run 
Down the bassoon player's throat.

FLAYING HOOKE Y. 
Sung by SHERIDAN And MACE. 
We're as happy, just as happy as can be, 
We're full of fun, my little Sue and me, 
We ran away from school to-day, 
An I 
oh, we had such fun: 
Playing hookey from the school, 
I 
know is against the rule, 
But we don't care, when we got there, 
The school it was begun. 
CHORUS. 
I 
don't care, I 
don't care, 
Do you, my little Sue, 
You know I 
don't, ycu know I 
don't, 
I'm happy when with you. 
(Repeat.) 
First we went and got some cherries in the wood, 
And I'll bet you they tasted good, 
And then we went down to the pond, 
And with the ducks did play ; 
Then Jimmy climbed an apple tree, 
And threw all the cherries down to me, 
But a 
great big dog he chased us. 
Oh, didn't he frighten me 
I 
don't care, Arc.

Oh, far you well—do far you well,

Hop-toad, he skipped and jumped; 
Parson he jumped too ; 
Old missy caught me stealing; 
She lain me with her shoe; 
Jay bird, its heels behind ; 
Niggers too likewise gwine 
To climb a 
mountain hill, 
Jump clean through the skies. 
Oh, far you well, etc. 
THE GRAND OLD MISSISSIPPI . 
Written and composed by BILLY LESTER. 
Sung by LESTER and ALLEN. 
GOOD evening to you, one and all; 
We have just come out to sing a 
little ditty ; 
It is about those times has past and gone; 
How we used to work on the grand old Mississippi. 
Oh, the passengers they used to wink, 
And look at us so shy, 
Because we dance and do a 
break. 
And throw our leas so high 
But now we have sung our little ditty, 
We'll go back again to the grnd old Mississippi. 
White folks, we can no lonffer stay, 
0: the folks will think that we have run away ; 
But as soon as we reach the old plantation, 
Why, a 
song and dance will be our occupation. 
Oh, the captain was as good a 
man 
As ever you did see ; 
He used to feed us on hoe- cake and sometimes hominy; 
But now we are through our little ditty, 
We'll go back again to the grand old Mississippi. 
PRETTY LITTLE JOE. 
Written by J. F. 
SHERIDAN. 
W HILE walking out the other day, 
Strolling up the street, 
Among the many passers-by 
Whom I 
chanced to meet, 
Was one of the fairest creatures 
That e'er saw the light of day, 
And as she tripped along by me 
My heart she stole away. 
Like a 
fairy, (symph.) 
Blithe and airy, (
symph.) 
She tripped along so gracefully, 
As homeward she did go— 
My fascinating, captivating, 
Pretty little Joe. 
As she went on I 
followed— 
She smiled and- turned around, 
When suddenly I 
saw her drop 
A card upon the ground ; 
I 
quickly picked the treasure up, 
Stood transfixed on the spot ; 
Just then she hailed a 
passing car, 
And into it she got. 
Like a 
fairy, etc. 
As that car it passed from view, 
It really made me sad ; 
But when I 
found I'd her address, 
I 
didn't feel so bad; 
Now I'm resolved to call on her— 
To win her love I'll try ; 
So, kind friends, for a 
little while, 
To you I'll say good-bye. 
Like a 
fairy. etc.

W HERE, where can Lulu be 1 
Surely she told me she'd vait for me 
Down by the willow glen, 
When dat old clock vos striking ten 
Till this moment there I

Knowing not why she delayed ; 
I

Dot she's got another young beau. 
Sweet Lulu my dear Lulu, 
Tell me, darling, where you are. 
CHORUS.

Oh, how happy I'd be,

DON'T FORGET THE OLD FOLKS AT HOME. 
Words and music by J. F. SHERIDAN. 
FOR the young folks our song is intended, 
Them their duty we wish to remind ; 
t 
,k 
We hope they Nvil I not be offended— 
'Tis said with intentions most kind ; 
We know as they spring up from childhood 
To strange, distant countries they roam, 
And seldom if ever a 
thought give 
To the old folks so lonely at home. 
CHORUS. 
Don't forget the poor old folks at home ; 
Remember the old folks at home ; 
They nursed you with care— 
Your hardships did bear ; 
Don't forget the poor old folks at home. 
They protected and nursed, aye, and cared for 
You, when so fragile and weak; 
They watched with affection your first smile, 
And taught you to lisp and to speak; 
And now they in turn have grown helpless, 
01(1 age cruel traces have shown; 
Is it right to refuse them assistance, 
And leave them forgotten, alone 7 
Don't forget, etc.

Till my master rapp'd my knuckles: 
On Sundays I'd trim my face to look grim, 
But spoilt all by my chuckles I 
The parson then would frown, 
And I, 'shamed of my sinning, 
Bit my lips to keep it down, 
But my eyes would still keep grinning I 
Oh, don't! please, don't I 
For you know I'm ticklish, very! 
And you won't 
say you won't! 
Oh, please don't I 
oh, please don't! 
Please, don't make me laugh! 
Oh, please don't 1 
oh, please don't ! 
3. So when lovers came, who sigh'd out their flame, 
And vow'd ' twas me they were after, 
I 
trembled, I 
trust, but to their disgust 
It was with inward laughter 
Some came who well might please, 
And others with much money, 
But to see them on their knees, 
To my mind was quite too funny 
Oh, don't! please, don't 
For you see I'm ticklish, very 
Say you won't? say you won't! 
Oh, please don't! oh, please don't 1 
Please, don't make me laugh! 
Oh, please don't! oh, please don't I

WE PUT ON LOTS OF STYLE. 
-Words by J. F. SHERIDAN. 
GOOD evening, kind friends—how are you'? 
We're glad to see you all; 
Having a 
little time to spare 
We thought we'd make a 
call; 
For it always gives us pleasure 
To shirr and dance for you, 
With your smiling faces round— 
'Tis what we like to do. 
CHORUS. 
For you look so sweet, 
And dressed so neat; 
When we go out to take a 
walk, 
The gals all at us smile ; 
The little dears can't help it for 
We put on lots of style. 
There was a 
dance the other night; 
Of course now we were there; 
We put on all our nice clothes, 
And oiled and curled our hair ; 
When the fiddle commenced to play, 
Then we began to dance; 
The figs they all went crazy, 
And the gals into a 
trance. 
CTIOR.ITS. 
Oh, we did it so neat, 
And looked so sweet, 
When we'd ask the gals to dance, 
They'd look at us and smile ; 
We set the poor gals crazy, 
For we put on lots of style. 
Now, white folks, we must leave you, 
For we've other work to do; 
Some other time we'll come again, 
And sing and dance for you; 
We're goinc, to another ball to- night; 
Now wouldn't you like to come 7 
We must fix up a 
little bit, 
So homeward we must run. 
(I)

WE PUT ON LOTS OF STYLE.—Continued. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, we'll look so sweet, 
And be dressed so neat; 
When we get there the gals will stare, 
And of course commence to smile ; 
We'll set the poor gals crazy, 
If we put on all our style. 
THE DANCING APOLLO. 
Jima: I 
am with blubber lips, 
Feet just like a 
pair of ships, 
Nose as flat as ever built, 
Eyes like holes burnt in a 
quilt, 
Mouth that spreads from ear to car, 
Monkey shines and actions queer, 
Dancing like a 
crazy one, 
To fill you with delight. 
CHORUS. 
Kick tip shins, 
Full of grins, 
These the pins 
That always wins, 
Coming like an avalanche to greet you every night. 
Nigger is the great man now— 
That white folks must allow ; 
Everybody clears the track, 
When they see a 
man that's black— 
Woolly head it is a 
sign 
That the owner's bound to shine; 
If you say he isn't, 
There's sure to be a 
fight. 
Kick up shins, etc

THE TWO SARAHS. 
THE GLORIOUS STARS AND STRIPES . 
By GEortan W ARE. 
Sung by the STUART SISTERS. 
THE stars gleam forever on your banner, 
The stripes flow along every fold, 
They speak of a 
nation's devotion, 
They tell of a 
race brave and bold; 
No tyrants sleep under its shadow, 
No harbor of cravens ' twill be, 
It floats o'er a 
nation of freemen— 
It signals the land of the free. 
CHORUS . 
Then stand there undaunted forever, 
Flow proudly o'er mountain and sea; 
Columbia the home of freedom, 
Columbia the shrine of the free. 
The fife calls the soldiers to duty, 
The bugle and soul-stirring drum, 
Up, up, with the star-spangled banner, 
The foe o'er our broad valleys come; 
Tramp, tramp, now our brothers are marchin ,
r. 
Step to step onward proudly come we; 
Columbia our mother is calling, 
March onward, ye. ons of the free. 
Then stand, etc. 
Thus clasped we return our devotion 
To her who can claim us her own ; 
To her dedicate we our future, 
Nor e'er fear a 
threat or a 
frown ; 
There, there float, thou proud starry ensign, 
And bright let thy colors e'er he; 
'Twas from heaven that thy light sprang, oh, banner, 
And it is God that hath christened the free. 
Then stand, ote. 
Sung by LESTER and ALLEN.

shall go mad; 
I 
don't know what to do; 
I'm in love with a 
charming girl ; 
We're to be wed in a

She is the darling of my heart ; 
With her I'm dead in love ; 
She's the sweetest girl for miles around, 
And I 
call her my turtle- dove.

Oh, my, you should see my Sarah— 
Eyes so bright and teeth so white, 
The fairest in the land; 
Oh, no, none could be so fair; 
Oh, banty toes and turn-up nose— 
My little Sarah Ann. 
Oh, we've known each other ever so long, 
And the first time that we met, 
I 
helped to push the barrel along, 
And the rain came down quite wet ; 
I 
helped to push the barrel along, 
Until we got to the door ;

penny to treat myself, 
Because she couldn't afford any more.

Sung by LESTER and ALLEN. 
On, white folks, now we'll say good-bye, we can no longer stay ; 
You hear the whistle blowing, and the steamboats on the way ; 
We're off for New Orleans, the cotton bales so brave, 
And when the boat am going our bandana we will wave.

WHAT SHOULD MAKE THEE EAT, MY DAR-
LING ? 
As sung by ED. FRENCH. 
W HAT should make thee eat, my darling, 
Pork and beans and mutton stew, 
ham and veal, and roasted turkey, 
hearts and livers, kidneys too, 
Sour krout, sausages, and limburg, 
Eggs and oysters, bread and crust I 
If you do not quit your gorging, 
Darling, you will surely bust. 
Beets and turnips you devour, love, 
Sweet potatoes take your eye, 
Cucumbers, cabbages, and string- beans, love, 
Heavy on your stomach lie; 
Quail on toast and prairie chicken 
Taste so lovely, so you say ; 
I 
should think so, for you eat, love, 
Sixteen good square meals a 
day. 
Pickled eel's feet, stewed canaries, 
Pig's feet broiled in kerosene, 
Elephants stuffed with sarsaparilla, 
Donkey's ears with pork and beaus, 
Beeswax fried in black molasses, 
Oysters stuffed with Arctic whales, 
Or frogs in glue prepared in fine cut, 
Hoopskirts broiled on monkey's tails. 
SIFT SAND, 
SAL. 
Sung by LESTER and ALLEN. 
Ou, look at this here sweetheart ; 
I 
told you what's her name ; 
She came from Louisiana, whare 
Dey hoe dat suoar cane; 
She's tall, slim, and slender, 
Her eyes as black as coal; 
She takes in washing, dollar a 
week, 
And she's as good as gold. 
Sift sand, Sal, sift, sift— 
Sift sand, Sal, sift, sift— 
Sift sand, Sal, sift, sift; 
Cow jumped over the moon. 
I 
took her to the parson ; 
Hadn't we such fun ! 
She clutched me and I 
clutched her, 
And the parson made us one; 
Balance to your pardner, 
Swing hands all around; 
Right and left to Liza Jane's, 
The prettiest gal in town. 
Sift sand, etc. 
OH, DIS IS WHAT I DID. 
KIND friends. I'm glad to see you 
Smiling all around ; 
I 
think I 
will just throw myself, 
I 
feel so good and sound; 
I've always been accustomed 
Dancing to the fid, 
And when I 
heard the music play, 
Oh, dis is what I 
did. 
When I 
came to this city 
To see the sights and fun, 
Among the pretty yaller gals, 
You bet I'm number one; 
I 
went into an auction store. 
For these ere shoes did bid, 
When the man he asked me for the pay, 
Oh, dis is what I 
did.

DT YOUR STADIA'S ON US. 
By 
SHERIDAN and MACK. 
There's some folks borrow trouble, 
And then they feel so blue, 
They go and throw themselves away, 
And don't know what to do; 
But we're a 
happy couple, 
Who don't make any fuss, 
And in this little song and dance, 
You can bet your stamps on us. 
CHORUS. 
Now don't you be a 
fool, 
But always take things cool, 
Jump ' round, break down, 
Twist your ankle thus, 
Don't you ever he afraid. 
To bet your stamps on us. 
There are some folks kind of airy, 
Who blow and talk quite loud, 
They would not notice common folks, 
They are so very proud ; 
But let them blow and put on airs, 
You needn't care a 
cuss, 
For whether school it keeps or not, 
You can bet your stamps on us. 
Now don't you, ezc. 
To keep out of double trouble, 
As through this world yon roam, 
Don't let trifles worry you, 
But take things as they come; 
Go right in, through thick and thin, 
If you get in any muss, 
Just drop a 
line and every time, 
You can bet your stamps on us. 
Now don't you, ikc. 
GOOSE AND INGUNS. 
Oh, dear, I-rn nearly starving, 
I 
want something nice to eat 
I 
fancy myself carving, 
Big pies and joints of meat. 
Roast pork or leg of mutton, 
To me would be of use; 
And though I'm not a 
glutton, 
Still, I'd polish off a 
goose! 
CIIOLUS. 
For it is my opinion, 
That stuffed with sage and ingur, 
No bird that flies is half so nice. 
As a 
Goose with sage and ingun. 
I'm very fond of Turkey, 
Spring Chicken is good to take; 
Of Partridge or of Pheasant, 
A dinner I 
could make. 
I 
like corned beef and mustard, 
Or sirloin steak with juice, 
Or Prairie hen or Bustard fat, 
But most I 
love a 
Goose 
For it is my opinion, &c. 
I've liver tried and bacon, 
And tripe both boiled and fried ; 
A 
sheep's head I 
have taken, 
And put myself outside. 
Though turtle soup is filling, 
And fish-balls joy produce; 
'Tis not the rapture or the joy, 
That appertains to Goose! 
For it is my opinion, dzc.

IT GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN.—[OoNctunEn.] 
2. A 
young man courts a 
pretty girl, 
And fancies she adores him ; 
But when he thinks the game is won, 
With some one else away she'll run ; 
Of course, he'll swear he doesn't care, 
Although it nearly floors him, 
And all the while he seems to smile, 
It goes against the grain.

3. Old maids, who don't deny their age 
Is something over thirty, 
May say they hate the sight of men, 
But still we find them now and then, 
At half a 
chance return a 
glance, 
And some get gay and flirty; 
Which shows, if they still single stay, 
It goes against the grain. 
Cho.— They fit the cap, &e. 
4. The vile garotters, when they're caught, 
And that is none too often, 
Are now rewarded with the cat, 
They very much object to that, 
And if some say its not the way, 
Their brutal hearts to soften, 
It makes them yell, so we can tell 
It goes against the grain. 
Cho.—But they fit the cap, &e. 
5. Since Nelson's day upon the sea, 
We've changed our style of fighting; 
Still the brave blue jacket lads, 
Cooped inside the ironclads, 
Are just as game, and true of aim, 
When wrongs require a 
righting ; 
As every foe must know, although 
It goes against the grain.

THE SWELL OF THE DAY. 
Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. 
H .

in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. H AEDTNG, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Words and Music by J. P. SxELIA% 
I 
AM a 
swell of the day as you see— 
All other swells are but models of me ; 
You must have heard of the name which I 
bear, 
Surely you must for I'm known ev'rywhere; 
Girls are enchanted when I 
am in view, 
Gents are bewildered and gaze at me too; 
Some criticise me and stare while they say, 
" 
Oh ain't he nobby, that swell of the day !" 
CIIORUS . 
I 
am the swell of the day— 
That' s 
what the people all say ; 
Go where I 
will they say to me still, 
lie's a 
genuine swell of the day. 
Now I 
confess I'm a 
little low down ; 
How can I 
help it when all thro' the town 
People are praying for times to improve 7 
Still I'm contented and keep on the move— 
Why should I 
grumble when care I 
have none 7 
All my delight is in fashion and fun, 
Friends crowd around me, and wine makes us gay, 
Then they all flatter the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell of the day, etc. 
I 
am accomplished and very refined ; 
Once I 
was rich, but my purse has declined ; 
Love is a 
stran2or as yet to my heart, 
But from the ladies I 
ne:er cm depart, 
They are the cause of my joy and despair ; 
None can resist them, so charming and fair ; 
Some spoeny fellows they drive to dismay, 
But they all cling to the swell of the clay. 
I 
am the swell of the day, etc.

Were happy, gay, and free ; 
A 
cosy club- room we have got, 
In a 
fashionable street, 
And two or three times every week 
The jolly boys there meet. 
SPOKEN.—Ves, assembled together we sit and talk over the 
topics of the day, and when I 
look around me and se., a 
dozen 
of the best hearted fellows in the world, I'm really proud to 
say that— 
CHORUS. 
I'm one of the boys, one of the boys— 
Always so happy when making a 
noise; 
one of the boys, one of the boys— 
l'm happy to say that I'm one of the boys. 
Together we sit, and talk and chat— 
Music, laughter, song, 
It fills the air for squares around, 
But nothing e'er goes wrong ; 
Content we are to share alike 
Each others' cares and joys; 
Hand in hand, and true as steel, 
You'll find the jolly boys. 
SPOKEN.—Yes; if misfortune in any way befalls one of us, 
the others don't forget their unfortunate companion. 
Oh, no! 
for at his side to cheer and comfort him in the hour of affliction 
you'll find--
One of the boys, etc. 
At billiards, rowing, base-ball, too, 
The boys are number one; 
In fact, in all the sports of life 
We're always in for fun ; 
Invitations we receive 
To every fancy ball; 
Dressed up in style the boys you find 
Observed by one and all. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, there's nothing, to compare with the pleasure 
of a 
good round dance when you have a 
pretty girl for a 
part-
ner and encircling the waist of the fairest in all the room you'll 
be sure to find— 
One of the boys, etc. 
MY LOVE SHE IS A FAIRY QUEEN. 
My love she is a 
fairy queen— 
About her face no paint is seen; 
Her pretty foot is very small, 
But very large is her waterfall; 
Her ankle too so plump and fat, 
It makes my heart go pit-a-pat ; 
Were I 
a 
bee upon her lip, 
I'd stay all day and sip and sip. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she never flirts—she's no coquette ; 
She never scolds, nor does she fret; 
She's some on style, and full of fun ; 
" 
You bet your life," she's number one. 
I 
took her to a 
show one night, 
I 
almost knew ' twould please her quite; 
And as we sat in the parquette, 
how nice I 
felt I 
scarce can say; 
The bell it rang, the curtain rose; 
A man came out in spangled clothes, 
Entrancing me with dashing style, 
While to my love he gave a 
smile. 
Oh, she never flirts, etc. 
To see my love next day I 
went— 
To pop the question was my intent ; 
Alas ! poor me, I 
felt quite sore 
To hear she'd gone in a 
coach and four; 
Her mother squealed and I 
did squall ; 
She'd took her trunk and waterfall ; 
I 
seized my hat—to the show I 
ran, 
But she'd eloped with a 
circus man. 
Oh, she never flirts, etc.

WHEN THE BELLS BEGAN TO RING. 
By 
BARRY CARTER. 
'TWAS summer, and the merry birds were singing, 
I 
was strolling by a 
brook one Sunday morn, 
And wishing then to hear the church bells ringing, 
When I 
met the sweetest darling ever born, 
With a 
jaunty bat, and saucy, laughing eyes— 
As lovely as a 
queen she was dressed ; 
When she smiled on me I 
was struck with surprise, 
And thought if she were mine I 
would be blessed. 
CHORUS. 
She's an angel from above— 
To my neck I 
fell in love ; 
She's as pretty as a 
picture of an angel, 
And sweeter than a 
birdie she can sing; 
I 
met her by the brook one Sunday morning— 
It was just before the bells began to ring. 
She took my arm, and off we went a- strolling; 
Soon I 
offered her a 
seat beneath a 
tree; 
The brooklet o'er its pebbly bed was rolling, 
When I 
I 
old her oh, how happy I 
could be, 
If she would be my darling little bride ; 
I'd be happier by far than any king ; 
She said, " I'm thine," and kissed me with a 
sigh; 
'Twas just before the bells began to ring. 
She's an angel, etc. 
She's just too sweet to live, this little daisy, 
With her darling sunny eyes and curly head ; 
I 
often think with joy I 
will go crazy, 
When my darling little beauty I 
shall wed ; 
She's an heiress too, and soon she'll be my own ; 
Then with joy I 
will cut a 
pigeon wing ; 
She'll be prett:er and sweeter than a 
rose just blown, 
Next Sunday, when the bells begin to ring. 
She's an angel, etc.

THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN. 
Su g 
by the STUART SISTERS. 
Goon evening, my friends; have you not a 
kind smile 
To welcome the daughters of Erin's green isle, 
And note the rich fun without any guile, 
That clings to the girls of old Ireland ? 
We come over here to Columbia's shore, 
Because we felt certain a 
friendly door 
Would be open, and you'd have a 
welcome in store 
To bestow on the girls of old Ireland. 
CHORUS. 
For a 
racketty, rollicking couple are we, 
As gay and as happy as happy can be; 
Folks call us the two merry girls of Tralee, 
Us jolly young girls of ould Ireland. 
America sure is the land we would seek. 
Where men can find labor and freedom to speak ; 
You succor the Irish when feeble and weak— 
They fly from their homes in ould Ireland, 
When English misgovernment sends them away, 
From homes that are falling to want and decay; 
Sure thousands have blessed you as day after day 
You received the poor exiles of Ireland. 
For a 
racketty, etc. 
So we'll make our home on American soil, 
Where bread can be won by those willing toil, 
Where monarchy is not our freedom to spoil, 
As it does for the people of Ireland ; 
So give us a 
welcome, and happy we'll be, 
To think that we have ventured here over the sea, 
For a.land where each man and each woman is free, 
Is the place for the girls of old Ireland. 
For a 
racketty, etc. 
Take the Army L;st and search it thro', examine ev'ry name, 
And von 11 not find an Officer eclipsing me in fame, 
For tho' no medals I 
have won—and never shall I 
think, 
ant the " Plun:ers " pet you know, in short I'm Captain Pink. 
Not know me? 
absurd 
When scarce a 
Morning Post comes out, but there my name you 
see, 
There's not a 
night I 
am not out, at Lady Someone's ball or rout, 
And bye-the-bye tht; routs I 
mean are victories for me. 
fie ! what, never heard of Captain Pink, its too 
Take the Army List and search it aim', examine ev'ry name, 
And you'll not find an Officer eclipsing me in fame, 
For tho' no medals I 
have won—and never shall I 
think, 
I 
am the " Plunger; " pet you know, in short I'm Captain Pink. 
Ask- the ladies they will tell you what a 
man I 
rm to dance, 
how dangrens ' tis to flirt with me, the dears have not a 
chance , 
You see we military men have manners quite our own, 
The " Plun ,ers " are invincible in storming Cupid's throne ! 
How can the darlin ,,-s stand this smile ? this killing hok it must 
beguile, 
I've pr.letised it much cA'ner than I 
ever did my drill ; 
Then in the valse, a 
gentle squeeze, I 
know the proper way to 
please, 
I'm call'd the " Lady-killer l" such my amatory skill. 
Take the, .3.7.c. 
I 
can make my spurs and sabre clank, and give the loyal salute, 
I 
can still retain my war-like ways tho' in my mufti suit; 
The Club chef is afraid of rue, I 
make my valet shake, 
And the very waiters tremble, when they ask me what I'll take. 
I 
am a 
judge of wine and weeds, I 
keep a 
pair of matchless steeds, 
And once to serve a 
chum of mine, I 
kept guard at the bank ; 
What's more, I 
once was in a 
figkt, a 
sham one " twits a 
glorious 
sight 
To see me at a 
hay-rick bravely charging down point blank. 
Take the, cic. 
I 
do not care for cricket much, they bowl so very swift, 
At Croquet I'm invincible, for spooning I've a 
gift; 
I 
also boast strategic skill, I 
bring it into play, 
By getting supper at a 
ball, the crush be what it may. 
I 
am ait. fait in songs and glees, I'm always good for mild sprees, 
I 
love my little luxuries, and so I 
have no wife 
I 
have a 
sword that's very clear, but would you be surprised to 
hear ? 
I 
never struck a 
blow with it in all my soldier life. 
Fin sure you all must join with me th giving England joy, 
To think, that in her army, she can men like me employ, 
And reckon on one officer at least who'll never shrink, 
From Fashion's duty calls, you know—your gallant Captain Pink.

THE SNOOZE. 
W ritten for ED. FRENCH by ED. HARRIGAN. 
THERE'S a 
fellow who lives in this city, 
And he sleeps on the floor of saloons; 
He lives on birdseed and crackers, 
And his business is juggling spittoons; 
He's known by every barkeeper, 
a 
hum lie is the worst of thin all; 
You bet he never would tumble, 
The ham with the terrible gall. 
CEORIIS. 
.They say he is a 
horrible snoozer, 
And a 
boozer, what a 
rooster; 
When he borrows your money you're loser, 
The snoozer with the terrible gall. 
He has got an eye in his head like a 
mackerel, 
And his neck is as long as "a 
crane; 
He eats gruel that is made out of sawdust, 
Mixed up with a 
seven days' rain ; 
His clothes would cover a 
hair-pin— 
Shoot him with a 
big cannon ball; 
You bet that he never would drop— 
The bum with the terrible gall. 
They say, etc.

I'm not of a 
quarrelsome nature at all, 
But a 
peaceaide sort of a 
mart, 
And I 
always avoid a 
dispute or a 
brawl, 
That's to say it' I 
possibly can. 
Still if people behave in an insolent way, 
Or to argue or fight are inclin'd, 
Why I 
first listen calmly to all they've to say, 
Then I 
give them a 
bit of my mind. 
CHORUS. 
A bit of my mind, a 
bit of my mind, 
If friend- or relations shoo1d e'er prove unkind 
You cannot conceive the relief that I 
find, 
if l' m able to give them a 
bit of my mind. 
'When a 
wild little urchin. of seven years old, 
I 
was under a 
pedagogue's r 
tile, 
And the fi.tst time I 
got into trouble, I'm told, 
Was for smashing a 
window at school ; 
I 
was promised the cane, as a 
matter of course, 
Which I 
told them was not very k 
ind, 
But I 
didn't much care tho' they flogged me by force 
For I 
gave them a 
bit of my mind. 
A bit of my mind Itz_ 
I've been sadly deceived by my intimate friend, 
Though I 
treated him just like a 
prince. 
For he took all the cash I 
could manage to lend, 
And I've never set eyes on him since : 
Still I 
wrote him a 
letter, indignant and strong, 
Fall of all the bad names I 
could find. 
And it pleas'd rue to think, tho' his conduct was wrong. 
T;.iat I 
gave him a 
bit of my mind. 
A bit of ray mind, & a. 
So if ever I'm injured, or treated amiss, 
AIv behavior is always the same, 
And rye oe satisfaction at least, which is this, 
That I 
don't think I'm greatly to blame. 
If are wife should elope w th a 
rival to-day, 
(Thwigh I 
might not at first be resiorn'd). 
I 
should feel myself better, •' I'm happy to say," 
If I

Beneath an elm, beside the spring. 
I 
sat just as the moon came o'er the hill ; 
And heard a 
voice in sweetness sing, 
Now in- thinks I 
hear it still. 
Angelic was the measure, 
It told of love and pleasure; 
0, would she were my treasure, 
And I 
her chosen dear. 
CHORUS. 
To sit beside that cooling spring, 
Or dance upon the meadow's velvet green, 
And feel myself a 
woodland king, 
With a 
fairy little queen. 
Once more I 
went at set of sun, 
To hear that voice and catch the loving strain ; 
And ere the cuckoo had begun 
His sweet song, it came again. 
From out the limpid water, 
The gods had surely brought her, 
More fair than morial's daughter, 
Was she who drew me there.

To sit beside. & e_. 
My heart was filled with perfect bliss, 
When to me spoke that little water sprite ; 
And said her wish was only this 
That I'd come there ey'ry night."

Her voice is something sweeter; 
With smile and kiss I 
greet her,

There's nothing half so charming 
As a 
happy married life, 
And nothing so alarming 
As a 
vixen for a 
wife; 
But as you make your bed, you know, 
So in it you must Ile. 
rio useless then to make a 
fuss— 
Take my advice, don t 
try, 
cuORI:S. 
A woman's sure to go her way, 
But when she's gone we miss her; 
So if you've had an angry word 
Why call her back and kiss her. 
A wife will surely rule the roost, 
Of course th.sts very proper, 
And if she means to rule you too, 
I 
don't think you can stop her. 
Be never cruel, always kind, 
Do nothing that will tease her, 
And if you wish to happy live, 
You'll du your best to please her. 
A woman's sure, 43C, 
A 
woman's sure to have her way. 
For that we cannot blame her, 
The remedy 1 
alt then I 
say, 
'Tis kindness that will tame her. 
Be always gentle, never harsh, 
And mind you do not flout her; 
And remember you're but helpless men, 
And cannot do without her. 
A woman's sure, ch. 
That woman is your greatest joy, 
Let every man reflect, 
Don't treat her as a 
wothles toy 
Nor slight her with neglect; 
If you possess a 
woman's love, 
What more does any need, 
In sicknesss or in health she'll be, 
A 
comforter indeed.

W HY turn away when I

Why cold to-day 
once I 
was dear; 
Then thy heart stirred and flushed thy brew ; 
Never a 
word comes to me now— 
Now thy hand lies listless in mine; 
Once its replies spake love divine; 
Cold as if we never had met; 
Can it then be hearts can forget ? 
Speak to me, speak— 
Be my heart heard, or it will break 
For one kind word; 
No vows to bind, no pledge I 
seek, 
Only be kind—speak to me, speak. 
One idle day thou didst deplore 
Some castaway on desert shore; 
'Twas but a 
tale, by poet feigned, 
Yet thou did'st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan, sad, sad to be 
Utterly lone, by the bleak sea;

FROM Madison to Union Square 
I 
often stroll to take the air, 
And at the pretty girls to stare, 
Walking up and down; 
I 
sometimes catch a 
gentle glance, 
That makes my heart with lapture dance, 
When I 
meet a 
lady friend, " by chance," 
Walking up and down. 
onoans. 
From Madison to Union Square 
I 
love to stroll and take the air, 
For all the beautiful girls are there, 
Walking up and down. 
At four each day I 
leave my home, 
And up and down Broadway I 
roam; 
Of course I 
seldom walk alone, 
I 
am known so well; 
I'm known at ev'ry step I 
take, 
And oh, such pretty bows I 
make; 
I 
was born the ladies' hearts to break, 
And to be a 
swell. 
From Madison, etc. 
The street is full, yet gay and proud, 
Upon each other still they crowd; 
And some in dress are rather " loud," 
Walking up and down; 
Some come to view the pretty hats, 
And some to have their little chats; 
Many are the queens of nice " French flats," 
Walking up and down. 
From Madison, etc. 
Just see that girl's bewitching gaze, 
While with her handkerchief she plays; 
Oh ! she has most delightful ways, 
Walking up and down. 
For belles and beaux no thoroughfare 
Can with this neighborhood compare; 
Oh! there is a 
charm, I 
do declare, 
Walking up and down. 
From Madison, etc. 
YOU AND I. 
Music and words by CLAntriEL. 
Sung by ALICE DUNNING LINGARD. 
We sat by the river, you and I. 
In the sweet summer time, long ago, 
So smoothly the water glided by. 
Making music in its tranquil flow ; 
We threw two leaflets, you. and I, 
To the river as it wandered on, 
Anti one was rent and left to die, 
And the other floated forward all alone. 
And oh ! we were sadden'd, you and I, 
For we felt that our youth's golden dream 
Might fade, and our lives be sever'd soon, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream. 
'Tis years since we parted, you and I, 
In that sweet summer time, long ago, 
And I 
smile as I 
pass the river by, 
And I 
gaze into the shadow depths below. 
I 
look on the grass and bending reeds, 
And I 
listen to the soothing song, 
And I 
envy the calm and happy life, 
Of the river as it sings anti flows along, 
For—oh ! how its song brings back to mc, 
The shade of our youth's golien dream, 
In the days ere we parted, you and I, 
As the two leaves were parecl o•1 thf-

WHY DON'T YOU COME AND SEE ME ?

HARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. Price 30 cents. 
I 
MET a 
lady friend to- day, 
Of charming look and manner gay; 
We stood a 
while to chat and smile, 
And long she lured me to delay; 
All things and topics we discuss'd ; 
Her voice was rich and creamy; 
" 
Where have you been'? 
You're awful mean ! 
Why don't you come and see me 7" 
CHORE'S. 
Why don't you come and see me 7 
Why don't you come and see me'? 
I'm sure there's no danger— 
I'm always at home. 
Why don't you come and see me 7 
Why don't you come and see me 7 
Why are you such a 
stranger 7 
Ah, why don't you come'? 
" 
You know," she said, " the nights are long; 
You know my patience is not strong ; 
To cheer my eyes and stop my sighs, 
I 
need sometimes a 
smile or song." 
She press'd my arm and smiled so sweet, 
And look'd with eyes so dreamy, 
I 
really trembled when she said, 
" 
Why don't you come and see me ?" 
Why don't, etc. 
In vain I 
ask you every day, 
And all my anxious love display ; 
Our hands caress—you say, " Oh, yes! 
To you I'll quickly make my way ;" 
But though I 
wait each night until 
My eyes grow dull and dreamy, 
You leave me there in love's despair_ 
Why don't you come and see me '? 
Why don't, etc. 
When tea is over pa goes out, 
And ma— well, seldom she's about; 
So there I'm left, of joys bereft, 
To sing, or sigh, or sadly pout; 
'Tis then I 
wish a 
friendly face 
Might fall in view to free me 
From loneliness—my heart's distress— 
Why don't you come and see me ? 
Why don't, etc. 
TAKE A LESSON FROM ME. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
JOGGING along thro' life a 
rover, 
Over the world I've been ; 
'Mongst the wealthy and clever, never 
One contented I've seen. 
The poor declare with a 
fairer share 
Of wealth they'd never complain ; 
But experience s:tows that appetite grows, 
And greed increases with gain.

Some who care to be ever clever, 
Never their object wiil see, 
If content to be very merry, 
Take a 
lesson from me. 
Sone who get rich in a 
hurry, worry, 
how their wealth to employ ; 
Betier, instead of sighing, trying 
lbw that wealth to enjoy. 
The possessor of true Felicity 
ne'er as yet have met, 
The nearest approach is the man who'd be 
Contented with what he could get. 
Some who care, etc. 
All is. not gold that glitters—bitters 
Under the surface may lie, 
Which knowingly we'd not care for, thexefore, 
Trust not too much to the eye. 
For much we see look lovely, that we 
Would find unpleasant to taste; 
What thus we get brings but regret, 
That trouble and time we should waste. 
Some who care, etc. 
Fortune fickle and strange is, changes

Should she deceive you, let her, better 
Never a 
word to say. 
For many will come with gifts to your home, 
If they fancy that you succeed, 
Who would pass you by without a 
sigh, 
If they knew that you were in need. Some who care, etc. 
Where the boots pinch they who wear them, bear them, 
Only with a 
certainty know

THE FORSAKEN. 
" 
SHE SAT BESIDE THE MOUNTAIN SPRING." 
Words by II. 
AME. 
Music by VIRGINIA GABRIEL.

way, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
Sas sat beside the mountain spring, 
Her feet were on the water's brink ; 
And oft she wept when she beheld 
The birds that lighted there to drink. 
She wept, but as they spread their wings, 
Her sweet voice follow'd in the sky ; 
" 
He will return! 
I 
know him well, 
lie would not leave me here to die. 
He will return ! 
I 
know him well, 
He would not leave me here to die—here to die." 
And there she sat as months rolled on, 
Unmindful of the changing year; 
She heeded not the snow and rain, 
All seasons were the same to her. 
She looked upon the frozen stream, 
She listen'd to the night- bird's cry ; 
" 
He will return ! 
I 
know him well, 
He would not leave me here to die; 
He will return ! 
I 
know him well, 
He would not leave me here to die—here to die." 
He never came! in vain she watch'd, 
And dress'd the gold- drips of her hair ; 
Red berries for a 
bridal crown 
She places ev'ry morning there. 
At ev'ry shadow on the grass, 
She starts, and murmurs with a 
sigh : 
" 
He will return! 
I 
know him well, 
He wonld not leave me here to die, 
He will return! 
I 
know him well, 
He would nnt leave ;it? faro to die—here to die."

Sung by W E. HORACE LINGARD-
There is a 
fellow gay and sweet, 
I 
meet him every day, 
He has a 
cunning blonde moustache, 
And such a 
winning way ; 
Each time I 
chance to pass him by, 
He always looks the same, 
And " nobby," too, you bet he is, 
I 
wonder what's his name. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! he is gay and sweet, you bet, 
And always looks the same. 
He smiles at me when'ere we pass, 
I 
wonaer what's his name. 
Oh ! name. 
Last eve his elbow mine did touch, 
While standing in a 
throng, 
But quickly he apoligized, 
And say'd " I 
meant no wrong." 
"No harm," I 
said, for accidents 
Like that are very tame, 
And then he left my eager gaze, 
I 
wonder what's his name. 
Oh ! he is gay and sweet, &c. 
Perhaps to night he's in the crowd. 
That has assembled here. 
Will all my triends plea=e look around, 
And find the pretty dear.

If they will tell me. truly tImugh.

I

A

She has me quite enchanted, 
And I 
love to call her mine ; 
She's not an old acquaintance, 
But she has won my heart, 
And when we meet she looks so sweet 
It grieves me to depart. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love her, oh, so well ! 
I 
love her, oh, so well ! 
She smiles upon me as I 
pass her by, 
While love is gleaming in her beaut'ous eye ; 
Her glance is life to me and makes me sigh ; 
I 
love her, oh, so Nvell ! 
She often goes out walking, 
And we are sure to meet, 
And then we roam together 
Through the gay and busy street ; 
So gracefully beside me, 
Her fingers press my arm ; 
It makes me feel so happy ! 
0, it must be Cupid's charm. 
I 
love her, etc. 
Her form is full of beauty, 
Her smile is full of love, 
Her eyes are sisters of the stars 
That fill the sky above ; 
Her hair is brown and wavy, 
And ripples ' round her face; 
No other maid within my heart 
Shall ever find a 
place. 
I 
love her, etc.

On, we've parted from each other, and our dream of love is o'er, 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last, 
And we'll meet as only strangers in the future evermore ; 
Our once tender love is buried in the past; 
I've tried to bear the blow without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ach'd with pain ; 
But the burning tears would fall in spite of all that I 
could do, 
For thee, darling, whom I 
ne'er shall see again. 
CHORD'S. 
My dream of love is o'er; 
I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain, 
When the mem'ry of the past comes up before me like a 
dream, 
For thee, darling, whom I 
ne'er shall see again. 
They say you love another, and he's claimed you for his bride, 
And you ask me to forgive thee, and forget 
The vows we pledged together by the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into thy beauteous eyes, my pet ; 
Al', the heart is like the tide that flows and ebbs at will, 
And I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could ; 
Through all the future years I'll love thee dearly, love thee still, 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would. 
My dream of love, etc.

DEAR friend, I 
wish to show you how 
I 
charm the gents that gaze at me, 
Some say I'm a 
flirt, but here 
I 
vow that such a thing I 
ne'er would be ; 
This fan which dangles at my side, 
Brings lovers here from far and near, 
And when their pleadings are denied, 
They look so sad and sigh, " 0, dear I" 
I 
wave my fan just so, 
Then love begins to grow ; 
Sometimes I 
laugh at the foolish young men, 
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! foolish young men. 
cuonus. 
This is how I 
use my fan, 
With glances bright and love's delight, 
When I 
want to charm a 
man, 
This is how I 
use my fan. 
When at the op'ra or the ball 
I "do" the graceful like a 
queen, 
I'm sure to take the shine off all ; 
They make me quite a 
heroine. 
Sometimes I 
know not what to do 
To keep intruding gents at bay ; 
The tales they tell make me rebel, 
And thus I 
wave them all away. 
I 
wave my fan just so 
To make them come or go. 
None can resist it when held in my hand, 
All must obey its bewitching command. 
This is how, etc. 
If gentlemen will fall in love, 
It's not my fault I 
do declare, 
They do all sorts of things to prove 
Their adoration and despair. 
Some kneel before me on the floor 
And talk so sweet they make me blush ; 
They squeeze my hands and make them sore. 
Then I 
look down and say, " 0, hush ! 
Get up, get up, young man, 
I 
shall strike you with my fan 
Off with your nonsense and foolish display— 
I 
can't allow it—now please go away." 
This is how, etc.

DARLING, I 
am growinrc 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to-day ; 
Life is fading fast away ; 
But, my darling, you will be—will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes my darling, you will be 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS . 
Darling, I 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away. 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say— 
" 
Oh, my darling, mine alone—alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes ! my darling, mine alone, 
You have never older grown ! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love can never more grow old; 
Locks may lose their brown and gold, 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know 
Never, never winter's frost and chill ; 
Summer's warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer's warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair— 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc.

SOME find great enjoyment in drinking, 
And cling to the glass all their days, 
But while they go on they are sinking— 
The wine cup its victim betrays ; 
'Tis better to shun all temptations, 
Than weep when you're over the spree; 
So whenever they say, " Will you drink ?" 
Answer, " Nay I 
a 
glass of cold water for me." 
C1101tIlS. 
0, give me the glass of cold water— 
From wine let me ever be free; 
I 
answer to all invitations, 
" 
A 
glass of cold water for me." 
A man may be healthy and wealthy, 
A man may be gifted and wise, 
But let him give way to intemp'rance, 
And soon all his manliness dies; 
Peace dwells in the clear flowing water— 
From all nature's ills it is free ; 
So whenever they say, " Will you drink ?" 
Answer, " Nay ! a 
glass of cold water for me." 
0, give me the glass, etc. 
A 
fig for your brandy or sherry— 
They only bring woe to the brain ; 
To-night you may drink and be merry, 
But think of the subsequent. pain ; 
Then take the pure draught, and ever 
Stray far from the wine's fatal glee, 
And whenever they say, " Will you drink ?" 
Answer, " Nay a 
glass of cold Nvater for me." 
0, give me the glass, etc.

I 
will not say ' good-bye,' " she said, 
"But simply Au revoir.' " 
CHORUS. 
" 
Au revoir," " Au revoir," 
Little word full of future glee; 
" 
Au revoir," " Au revolt.," 
Oh, it sounded like music to me. 
And tho' I 
leave my darling girl 
For many a 
weary day, 
I'll ne'er forget those last sweet words, 
Which made my heart so gay; 
And tho' I 
roam in foreign lands, 
And sail from shore to shore, 
Those little words seem ever near, 
" 
My darling, Au revoir.' " 
" 
Au revoir," etc.
