Dear Dr. Spivacke:
This is the letter received from Professor Morris after our first report on recording had been
made to him. The expedition wired from Cross City that they had made some excellent
recordings at the turpentine camp and were greatly in need of more for South Florida.
So if you could send the additional records to Writers' Project office. 712 Wallace S.
Building, Tampa, we will be able to cooperate with Professor Morris at Tarpon Springs and
complete recordings at Sebring and Tampa. The reason for speed is that many of our field
workers fall within the 18 months ruling and our operations will be curtailed after August 31
for several months.
Sincerely yours, Carita Doggett Corse Carita Doggett Corse State Director Federal Writers'
