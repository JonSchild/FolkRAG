February 27, 1941, letter from Alan Lomax to H.M. Bond
February 27, 1941 Mr. H.M. Bond, President The Fort Valley State College Fort
Valley, Georgia
Dear Mr. Bond:
I'm awfully sorry to have missed you and to have to tell you that I can't possibly come to
the Festival as I had planned. I am, however, still trying to arrange to send a Library of
Congress recordist down, and will see that you have word the first of next week about this.
Mr. Schmidt has invited me to the Fisk festival the end of April and I look forward to
meeting you there.
Cordially yours, Alan Lomax Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Song
