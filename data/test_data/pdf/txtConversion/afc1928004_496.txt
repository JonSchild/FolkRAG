Tell Me Love, Will You Remember? 
Duet sung with great success by the WarricEv's, in their original 
sketch, " Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Tell me love, will you remember 
When I'm far away from thee ? 
Will you still be true my darling, 
When I'm sailing o'er the sea, 
Keep the vows of love we plighted 
When we bade our last farewell, 
That you'll keep me in remembrance, 
Tell me, darling, only tell ? 
Cnonns. 
Whisper softly, sweetly, darling, 
Say I 
will be true to thee, 
Though for years we may be parted, 
Promise to remember me. 
Tell me love, will you remember 
When the roses cease to bloom? 
And December, bleak and dreary, 
Takes the place of gentle June. 
Though we may be parted, darling, 
By the cruel hand of time, 
Promise that you will be true, love, 
'Till I 
come to call you mine. 
(Chorus.)

Carrying the Hod. 
Written and sung by Jonw WarricmY, of the W HITNEY'S, with great 
success in their character sketch, " Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Oh, here I 
am, an Irish man, 
As you can plainly see, 
I 
have to work from morn till night 
To support my family. 
I 
left my dear old native land, 
Oh, yes, that dear ould sod, 
And its here I 
am in America, 
Carrying the hod. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, its mortar and bricks 
I 
have to carry from morn till night, oh, 
No sooner than I 
am to the top, 
Than then I'm down below. 
My friends they know both near and far, 
No matter where I 
trod, 
That there's not a 
man in this whole wide world 
Can bate me carrying the hod. 
At night when I 
am through my work, 
Right to my home I 
go, 
My wife she meets me with a 
smile, 
My children do also, 
it's take a 
chair and do sit down 
And rest yourself dear dad, 
For we know your tired and worn out 
From carrying the hod.

Two Flowers From Paddy's Land. 
Written for the W HITNEY'S, and sung with great success all over the 
United States. 
We are two honest emigrants 
Just landed on your shore, 
We left our friends and home behind, 
And we may not see them more, 
We've traveled all this wide world through, 
From Cork to the Isle of Man, 
And we sing and dance from morn till night, 
We're two flowers from Paddy's land. 
CHORUS. 
HE— 
My shillalah I 
can twist with ease 
Wherever I 
may go, 
SHE— And for courting pretty girls, me boys, 
I 
tell you he's not slow. 
BOTII— For singing or for dancing too, 
Just bate us if you can, 
Where e'er we go we always show 
Were two flowers from Paddy's land. 
Ould Ireland is a 
garden fair 
Where many flowers grow, 
One of them, hospitality, 
As all the world does know. 
And we're two more from Erin's shore, 
We travel hand in hand, 
And we grow in soil with honest toil, 
We're two flowers from Paddy's land. 
(Chorus.)

We Came From Ireland, 
Written by BEN CoLuNs for the WrarNEE's. 
Oh, here we are this evening, 
An Irish pair so true, 
We're just from Tipperary, 
Across the ocean blue. 
We'll sing and dance to please you, 
Our style you see is grand, 
We're as happy as two thrushes, and 
We came from Ireland. 
Crtontrs. 
Then watch our easy motion, (Break.) 
We have just come o'er the ocean 
To sweet America, 
We're gay and free as the little birds, 
And we'll have you to understand, 
We are two Irish Paddy's, and 
We came from Ireland. 
We left our native country 
While the birds were singing gay, 
To meet you here this evening 
We've braved the stormy sea, 
We 
left our friends behind us, 
And as we waived our hand, 
We softly murmured to them all, 
We're leaving Ireland. 
G7toru8.) 
HE— 
SHE— 
BOTtf— 
Written and sung by the W HITNEY'S. 
We ran away from school to- day, 
A 
little fun to see, 
And you can bet that we will see it, 
For we're as gay as gay can be. 
The teacher said she'd lick us 
If we ran away again, 
But then we'll take the licking, 
For in school we can't remain. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, we ran away (Break.) 
From the school to-day, (Break.) 
Oh, we ran away from school to-day, 
To have a 
jubilee, 
So now we'll have a 
dance, and then 
Hook up the jamboree. 
Oh, Sallie, she's a 
daisy, 
The darling of my heart, 
And Georgie is my choice too, 
From him I'll never part. 
We'll live happy together, 
And one thing more we'll say, 
We'll come and see you all again 
When next we run away.

The Tipperary Couple. 
Written and sung by the W HITNEY'S. 
Arralf, we just come over, from Ireland, 
As you can plainly see, 
We'are the Tipperary couple 
That's full of fun and glee, 
For to sing and dance is our delight 
We'll have you all to know, 
For at it'we ,always jump, me boys, 
Wherever we may go. 
CHORUS. 
For we're two Irish Paddy's, 
Yes, we're two Irish Paddy's, 
Arrah we are the Tipperary couple 
That's full of fun and glee, 
For to sing and dance is our delight 
Wherever we may be. 
Arrah, the day we left ould Ireland, 
Sure the morning it was clear, 
And as we sailed away, our friends 
They all did weep in tears, 
Saying, good-by my neat little Irish pair, 
We ne'er shall see you more, 
For your going away to the land of the free, 
America's lovely sho--
(Chorus.) 
I Am A Soldier Bold. 
Sung by JOHN W HITNEY with great success in the sketch entitled. 
" 
Irish Patricts." 
I 
love the sword and bayonet, 
I 
like to hear them clash, 
There's music in the rifle 
And glory in the flash. 
When the thundering cannons rattle 
And the foe fades from our sight, 
Let victory crown the hero, 
4 • 
And God defend the right. 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
soldier, should you want me, 
You will find me in the ranks of glory. 
I'm a 
soldier, should you want me, 
You will find me in the ranks of glory. 
Let shot and shell by fury winged, 
Burst round me as they fly, 
And front to front with death at bay, 
I'd lift that standard high, 
And there defend it to the last 
'Till daylight through me shines, 
And man and flag by shot and shell 
Are scattered to the winds. 
(Chorus.) 
But should I 
fall in glorious war, 
Be decked with crimson wounds, 
Let muffled drums and trumpets sound 
To soothe my dying moans. 
And o'er my grave discharge your shot 
With steady hand at arch, 
And funeral notes from trumpets sound 
The soldier's last sad march. 
(Chorus.) 
9 
Originally sung by Sitzpettn & W HITNEY. 
The summer sun was shining fair 
As I 
tripped o'er the lea, 
A 
damsel fair with golden hair 
And eyes too blue to see, 
The birds were singing sweeter 
Than they'd ever sung before, 
And echoing to the warblings of 
That sweet face at the door. 
CHORUS. 
'Then I 
felt so happy when I 
saw (Break.) 
My Nellie sitting at the door, (Break.) 
Oh, music haunts my memory, 
And gently steals me o'er, 
I 
know I 
never shall forget 
That sweet voice at the door. 
Long years have come and gone since then, 
And gently passed me o'er, 
But still my loved one sits and sings 
Her sweet songs at the door. 
But when I 
dream of other days 
I 
love them as before, 
I 
know I 
never shall forget 
That sweet voice at the door. 
(Chorus.) 
Sung by Emma WFITI-NEY, of the WurrNtEr's, in their character sketch, 
" 
Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Oh, my heart is filled with joy, 
I 
scarce know what to say 
About ray darling blue-eyeduban, 
I 
think of night and day. 
'Twas on last Sunday that we met 
Among the sweet grape vines, 
And the little birds were singing forth 
Their sweet, harmonious rhymes. 
CHORUS. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
little red rose 
That blooms down in the shady lane, 
The sun shines from the sky so bright, 
On my pretty darling little blue-eyed Dan. 
He dresses neat, his voice is sweet 
As the sound of a 
silvery bell, 
And often times I 
run away, 
To meet him in the dell. 
He met me at the orchard gate 
Last Sunday eve at nine, 
And whispered love tales in my ear, 
And I'm sure he will be mine.

Oh! If I Knew the Man That 
Learned Her to Spar. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND fcr JOHN W HITNEY. 
Oh, I've got a 
wife her name is Christine-, 
She is a 
hundred and nineteen, her nose it is green, 
She can crawl through a 
gas pipe, 
She's getting so lean, 
She can waltz on her 'eyebrows all night, 
If I 
tell her to wash my porous plaster, 
Its then she will kick, slug me with a 
brick, 
Make me go to the butchers for tick, 
I'll bet you seven dollars Johnny Dwyer she can lick, 
For her breath is as strong as an ox. 
Cnonus. 
Oh, if I 
knew the man that learned her to box, 
I'd give him the small pox or Chastine Cox, 
I'd hit him with a 
brick or a 
dozen of rocks, 
For learning my wife how to spar. 
The other evening I 
came home with a 
new pair of pants, 
She stabbed me with a 
lance, 
Then I 
fell in a 
trance, 
Then she picked all my pockets when she got the chance 
And danced a 
Dutch reel on my neck, 
She picked me up like a 
baby and threw me into bed, 
Put a 
bandage on my head, 
1 
thought I 
was dead, 
Next morning when I 
got up I 
was blue, white and red, 
And my nose was all over my face. 
(Chorus.) 
The Yankee Girl. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND for EMMA W HITNEY, of the W HITNEY'S, and 
performed by her -with great success in their character sketch, 
" 
Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Oh, here I 
am, a 
yankee girl, 
My name is Sally Brown, 
I 
can eat more pumpkin pie or apple sass, 
Than all the girls in Oskosh town. 
I 
can hoe or plow upon a 
farm 
Till the sun my skin does tan, 
My brother Bill caught me last night 
A 
kissing the hired man. 
Spoken. — Yes, Bill catched me kissing the hired man, 
and I 
got the darndest thrashing you ever seen, I 
did, and 
the night before I 
had to go to bed at 4 
o'clock in the 
afternoon for sucking eggs. 
But me and the hired man 
has fun, by gosh, we do. 
We rigged up a 
stuffed man the 
other night, got a 
big white sheet around it, got charcoal 
and blackened him just like ribs, painted his eyes, and we 
got out of bed at 10 o'clock at night and went down to 
Parson Jones' house, stood it on the stoop, pulled the bell; 
the parson he came out, he got scared to death, he closed 
the door, ran in and got an old shot gun and fired out the 
window, and we were running down the street and he shot 
the hired man's hat, and Si Green seen us and told Parson 
Jones, and he had me and the hired man arrested and old 
Justice of Peace Simpson fined us 25 cents apiece, but if 
his daughter Sarah comes down to the Red School House 
I'll make her give me back that 25 cents, or I'll pull all her 
red hair out and give it to our two year old calf. 
CHOR17S. 
But oh, wnat good old times we had 
In school piaying circus clown, 
And playing tag with all the boys 
In good old Oskosh town.

Mary Ann McLaughlin. 
My Latest Captivation. 
Published by permission of GEO. MOLINEUX, Brooklyn. 
In a 
cosy cottage painted green, 
About three miles from here, 
There lives a 
pretty Irish queen, 
To me she does prove dear. 
Her mother takes in washing, 
And the girl helps at the trade, 
And when I've called upon her 
These words I've often said: 
CHORUS. 
Mary Ann McLaughlin, don't you cry, 
Take that apron from your eye; 
Don't you let the neighbors hear you sigh, 
And we'll be married by-and-by. 
Now soon I'm going to married be, 
Of course I'll settle down; 
I'll buy a 
house, also a 
farm, 
A 
short way out of town. 
Oh, then it will be joyful, 
When as cosy as a 
mouse; 
To see the young O'Malleys 
Play tag around the house. 
Mary Ann McLaughlin, &c. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
15 
Written by DAISY REMINGTON, and dedicated to HINES and BLOSSOM. 
I'll sing of a 
blonde I 
met one day, 
While walking on the street, 
She was dressed in the very latest style, 
And what darling little feet ! 
As she tripped along she shyly glanced 
At me with her lovely eyes ; 
I 
made my mind up then and there 
That she should be my prize. 
CHORUS. 
She's sweeter than the violets in the spring time, 
Or the lilies as they bloom so pure and white; 
No rose can compare with her in beauty, 
She is more to me than 'heaven's own sunlight. 
I 
called on her, at her request, 
She met me at•the gate, 
We talked about so many things, 
Ere I 
lett iowas growing late. 
But I 
had mustered courage up, 
And asked her for her hand ; 
She says she has loved me from the first, 
I'm the happiest man in the land. 
She's sweeter, &c.

Man, Know Thyself'. 
Sung by HARRY BECKWITH. 
Let each man learn to know himself, 
To gain that knowledge let him labor, 
Improve those failings in himself 
Which he condemns so in his neighbor; 
How lenient our own faults we view, 
And conscience voice adaptly smother, 
But oh how harshly we review 
The self same errors in another. 
CHORUS. 
Let each man learn to know himself, 
To gain that knowledge let him labor, 
Improve those failings in himself 
Which he condemns so in his neighbor. 
And when you meet an erring one 
Whose deeds are blameable or thoughtless, 
Consider, ere you cast the stone, 
If you yourself be pure and faultic.i.. 
Or list to that small voice within, 
Whose whisp'rings oft make men conf3unded, 
And trumpet not another's sin, 
You'd blush deep if your own were sounded. 
Let each man, &c. 
Or in self-judgment, if you find 
Your deeds to others are superior, 
To you has Providence been kind, 
As you should be to those inferior. 
Example sheds a 
genial ray 
Of light that men are apt to borrow, 
So first improve yourself to-day, 
And then improve your friends to-morrow 
Let cach man, &c.

MY FATHER SOLD CHARCOAL,17 
As Originally Sung by DICK SANDS. 
When I 
was a 
servant in sweet Tipperar3,, ! 
I 
-was as smart as the Divil, 
And just as contrairy, oh ! 
An Irish gosson, 
And great was th'applause of it; 
My father sould. charcoal, 
And that was the cause of it. 
An Irish gosson, 
And great was th'applause of it; 
My father sould charcoal, 
And that was the cause of it. 
Arrah! my mother, poor soul! had a 
habit of drink. 
She fell in a ditch, [ing, 
Which set her thinking, oh! 
A 
mammoth Phratee, 
And great was the size of it; 
My mouth held a 
dozen, 
Which widened the breadth of it. 
Me mouth held a 
dozen, 
Which widened the breadth of it; 
My father sould charcoal, 
And that was the cause of it. 
At a 
break-down or reel, 
It's highly and dutiful, 
And if to remember, 
You deed not to stare at me; 
Sure, I 
can wear my brogans, 
Both behind and in front of me. 
And how does ye's do? 
I 
see ye's all laugh at me; 
And what would ye's give 
For a 
nice Photograph of me? 
And if to remember, 
You need not stare at me; 
Sure, I'll give every mother's son of yell 
A 
lock of the hair of me.

My Grandfather's Hen. 
Composed by NED OLIVER. 
Dedicated to JOHN F. 
FIELDS. 
My grandfather Ben had an old Shanghai hen 
Who laid eggs the size of a 
keg; 
She stood six feet high, from her foot to her thigh, 
And she measured one yard around the leg. 
She had an old rooster, her company for to keep, 
But at last he was killed and served fried, 
And she stopped, short, never to lay again, 
When the Shanghai Rooster died. 
CHORUS. 
No more fresh eggs in the morning, chick, chick, chick, muck, 
The breakfast table adorning, chick, chick, chick, chick; 
But stopped, short, never to lay again, 
When the Shanghai Rooster died. 
In roaming around the farm the old hen took delight. 
And when evening's shades began to fall 
She'd hop up on the roof with the rest of the gang, 
Or stay out with her shanghai on the wall. 
But when daylight did appear, to the corn patch they 
would steer, 
And they would gobble up worms side by side; 
But she stopped, short never to gobble again, 
When the Shanghai Rooster died 
No more fresh eggs, &c.

Many Things that Ought not to N. 
#.n Original Song by PR,mic LEwiS. 
As snug by him 
at Fox's Theatre, Philadelphia. 
There is not a 
day as we pass thro' this life, 
And I 
think you will with me agree, 
There are many mistakes in this world we do meet, 
And things that ought not to be. 
Is it right that a 
soldier who fought in the war, 
And lost, perhaps an arm or a 
leg, 
Should grind a 
hand organ to please passers by, 
And for food, on our charity beg ? 
Crtorms. 
These thins should be stopped in this great land of ours' 
Where every man boasts he is free; 
So I 
thought I'd tell you, by words in my song, 
Many things that ought not to be. 
Lt It right that each Savings Bank always should break, 
And the depositors receive not a 
dime; 
Is it right, the ladies, striped stockings should wear, 
And knock us poor men out of time. 
Is it right a 
poor workman should wear out his life, 
And earn but one sixty a 
day, 
While some roll in riches, big sinecures hold ? 
These are things that ought not to be. 
These things should be, & c. 
Is it right that our army it should be cut down 
To save but a 
dollar or two; 
Was it right to send Custer and a 
few hundred men, 
To be killed by the wild Indian foe; 
Is it right to mix silver with copper and brass, 
And give it to us to make change; „ 
Is it right to let Spain still give us the laugh. 
When the Virginius we've yet to revenge ? 
These things should be, Sco. 
Is it right that the White House should bear the name 
Of Headquarters! where swindles are done; 
Where they steal all they can from a 
poor soldier's food, 
To a 
barrel of whiskey or rum; 
Is it right, when we've millions of acres to spare, 
And all the whole world we could feed, 
That a 
man should be poor, in this great land of ours, 
For which our brays fathers did bleed? 
— 
These things should be,

MY CHARMING KATE. 
Written and sung by Wm. SCANLAN, in his original sketch, en-
titled " Preparing for the Stage," and performed by 
the great SCANLAN and CRONIN. 
Music pub-
lished by F. W. HELMICK, No. 60 
Fourth St., Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Have you ever been to the opera 
When the darling young ladies were there, 
It was there I 
met one evening 
A 
lady so charming and fair. 
Her eyes were as bright as the stars 
That twinkle and shine up above, 
And I'll ne'er forget the evening 
That first I 
met my love. 
CHORUS. 
She's as fair as a 
lily, 
Gentle as a 
dove; 
Looks like a 
little star 
Twinkling above. 
I 
love her dearly, 
I'd die for her sake; 
There is none in this wide world 
Like my love Kate. 
If you ever should see this young lady, 
In love with her you'd surely fall; 
She's always dressed up in fashion, 
In size she's not small nor yet tall. 
She is just as pretty as a 
picture, 
You'd travel for miles to see, 
And I 
don't mean to flatter myself, but 
She's awfully gone on me. 
She's as fair, etc. 
If it's my luck to marry this creature, 
For ever how happy I'll be; 
To sit at home of an evening 
With a 
nice little boy on my knee, 
To hear him call me his papa. 
Well, enough I 
think I 
have said, 
The rest I 
shall tell you some evening 
Alter Kate and I 
are wed. 
She's as fair, etc.

Major Magoozlura. 
Written by WASH. FAVOR for the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELD.. 
We are two gallant soldier boys 
That you very seldom meet; 
And though we never refuse a 
drink, 
We were never known to treat. 
We work the lunch routes every day, 
And get taffy on a 
stick, 
From the fellows that's fly, they give us the guy, 
But we're never known to kick. 
CHORUS. 
Major .Magoozlum, just from Jerusalem, 
Where we've been training the Turks how to fight; 
They call us two ,guagers, the Judge and the Major, 
But still we go mashing the girls all night. 
We never get cranky, for Moody and Sankey 
Told us it was a 
sin ; 
We never do fight, if ever we're tight, 
But at our work we begin. 
We draws the cans from under our coats, 
And drain the kegs for beer; 
We drink it quite sly, and wink our left eye, 
Then walk off on our ear.

Sung nightly by W ILL. H. 
MORTON, with HARRIGAN LK; 
HART'S 
Combination. 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The subject Ill mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you. 
Should you meet a 
man that is down in the work 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
While one cannot always help many. 
A r 
an may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor, 
He struggles his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door. 
To sueh worthy men, 'tis a 
terrible blow, 
So give it to those most in need, 
For you who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
T 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my sorg, 
That nothing I've said out of place ; 
A man though he's poor may still honest be, 
For poverty is no disgrace. 
So give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
We don't know how scon things may turn; 
Give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he'll surely return. 
As sung by Miss IDA BRUMMELL and HARRY BECKWITH in his original 
musical sketch, " Irish Love—Making." 
You're looking as bright as the morn, darling 
You're looking as bright as the day; 
And while on your charms I'm dilating 
You're stealing my poor heart away. 
But keep it and welcome, mavourneen, 
It's a 
loss I'm not going to mourn; 
Sure one heart's enough for a 
body, 
Then, pray, give me yours in return. 
CHORUS.

SHE. 
I 
can't give you mine in return. 
Mavourneen! 
Oh, leave me! 
Then, pray, give me yours in return. 
Ah! you're smiling, and that's a 
good sign, darling, 
Say yes, and you'll never repent; 
Or, if you had rather be silent, 
Your silence I'll take for consent. 
Now, that good-natured dimple's a 
tell-tale, 
And all that I 
have is your cvn; 
This week you may be Kitty Tibbell, 
Next week you'll be Mistress Malone.

I

My rule is. never give tick, 
When there's a 
bum at the stove, on a 
cold winter's day 
It's meself that's making a 
kick. 
set out a 
lunch on the table so neat; 
Fat Herrings that's pickl'd in jar! 
I'd cut off the hand of snoozer or vag., 
That grabs, when I'm back of the Bar ! 
The till I 
keep in me pocket, so safe! 
Me Chandelier is a 
Kerosene Lamp! 
At daylight I 
put up me shutters so tight, 
And go in for to count up my stamps. 
I'm open all day of a 
Sunday, so gay!

They say as they pass by my windy so sweet, 
Dialone's at the back of the Bar!

Drunkard's Lone Child. 
OUT in this gloomy night sadly I 
roam, 
I've no mother now, no friends, no homq 
Nobody cares for me, no one would cry, 
Even if poor little Bessie should die. 
Barefoot and tired I've wandered all day 
Asking for work, but I'm too small, they y. 
the damp ground I 
must now lay my heaa,, 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is chm.d. 
CHORUS. 
Mother, why did you leave msi alone, 
With no one to love me, no friends and no honv: 
Dark is the night, the storm rages wild, 
God pity Bessie, the Drunkard's Lone Child. 
We were so happy till father drank rum, 
Then all our trouble and sorrow begun. 
Mother grew paler and wept every day, 
Baby and I 
were too hungry to play. 
Slowly they faded, and one summer night 
Found their sweet faces all silent and white. 
And with big tears slowly dropping I 
said, 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
Oh! if some temp'rance man only could find 
Poor, wretched father and speak very kind, 
If they could stop him from drinking, why then 
I 
should feel very happy again. 
Is it too late ? 
Men of temp'rance, please try, 
For little Bessie will soon starve and die. 
All the day long I've been begging for bread— 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead.

"4 ads by T. F. CASEY, music by CHARLES JEROME, and sung with great 
success by ELLA JEROME in the original sketch of" Comedy." 
What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June, 
When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
We pass the happy hours away, 
Where the music sounds so clear, 
Feeling happy, light and gay, 
As we smile on the fellows dear. 
What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June, 
When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon.

Oh, my, how happy we do be! (Sym.) 
Yes, yes. full of mirthful glee! (Sym.) 
What a 
pleasure it is flirting in the moonlight, 
On a 
sweet summer's eve in June. 
When the pretty little stars they shine so bright, 
In their dance around the glittering moon. 
Now the pleasures of flirting in the moonlight 
To you I 
could not tell ; 
And making love with some one at the first sight, 
Down in a 
fairy dell. 
With our fans held close up to our eyes, 
We watch for the passing swells, 
And look abashed at the moving skies 
Down where the floweret dwells. 
Now the pleasures of flirting in the moonlight 
To you I 
could not tell; 
And making love to some one at the first sight, 
Down where the flowerets dwell.

Oh, my, how happy we do be! (Sym.) 
Yes, yes, full of mirthful glee ! (Sym.)

FIFTH AVENUE GEORGE. 
Written by JOSEPH. P. 
SHELLEY. 
sung by SCANLAN and CRONIN, in their great character sketch, 
"The Swells," written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Music and words published by E. II. HARDING, 229 Bowery. 
Fifth Avenue George is a 
charmer, 
And every dear creature will swear, 
Of fashion he's always the leader, 
No gent with his style can compare. 
He leads an existence of pleasure, 
While blest with a 
fortune so large; 
And every one gives the opinion, 
There's none like Fifth Avenue George. 
CHORUS. 
Fifth Avenue George, Fifth Avenue George, 
Upon him the girls fondly smile. 
For fun and good cheer to the boys he is dear, 
He's the leader of fashion and style. 
He wears a " Knox" hat made to order, 
And his diamond can vie with the sun: 
A 
gold-headed cane he keeps twirling— 
As a 
swell he is " A 
No. 1!" 
He can waltz like a 
girl in the ballet, 
And sing like a 
signor from Rome; 
In ev'ry grand parlor or ball-room, 
Fifth Avenue George is at home. 
Fifth Avenue, etc. 
He thinks every business is vulgar, 
He can't comprehend the hard times; 
His manner is very romantic, 
And he talks about poets and rhymes. 
He plays " philopene" with the ladies, 
And flirts with the belles all around; 
Each day on Broadway promenading, 
Fifth Avenue George can be found. 
Fifth Avenue, etc.

FRISKY SALLY GRAY. 
AIL—Maggie May. 
By J. W. Moarot4. 
THE Spring has skedaddled, July bad come; 
And the chickens had ceased to lay. 
Down by a 
puddle in Central Park, 
I 
first saw Sally Gray. 
She had a 
nice, bully, glass-eye, 
And was romping all the day, 
And 1 
dearly loved, at sight, this girl, 
Whose name was Sally Gray. 
CHORUS. 
My frisky, frisky, Sally, Sally, 
Romping all the day, oh! 
I'll bet my life there's not a 
girl 
Can equal Sally Gray. 
As Sal walked out one afternoon, 
About ten o'clock at night, 
She met a 
tall man dressed in blue, 
Who said that I 
was tight. 
He also said 
was a 
beat, 
My bills I 
could not pay, 
But my purse is in the care of one, 
And that is Sally Gray. 
My frisky, ,tc.. 
In the faro bank for Sally's sake, 
My cash I 
put away, 
That I 
some day to cupid's shrine, 
May take sweet Sally Gray. 
For she's dead gone on me, 
And as time it flies away, 
I 
shall often think of the puddle in the Park, 
Whare first I 
met Sally Gray. 
My frisky, er4

Jerry Slattery. 
As sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J FISHER, 1879. 
Jerry Slattery was a 
tailor, he was ninety years of age, 
He had a 
son named Micky, a 
play actor on the stage. 
He'd play Romeo with his sister, for diamonds he'd give her 
pork and beans, 
Then little Michael Slattery would tear the bedclothes up for 
scenes. 
He is crazy, he is lazy, he broke his leg last week, 
He is always singing, always dancing, and playing tragedy in 
his sleep. 
He is always talking of Mary Anderson, he'd support her on 
the stage, 
Sure last night he got so crazy, we had to put him in a 
cage. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's little Michael Slattery stole his father's pants, 
He cut them up for tights to do a 
song and dance; 
When his mother was asleep he cut her hair off for a 
wig, 
Now little Micky Slattery is doing an acrobatic jig. 
He cut off his father's whiskers to play Hamlet and King Lear, 
Took a 
shot gun to his mother and made her walk off on her ear, 
He learned his sister dancing, cut off eleven of her toes, 
Now little Micky Slattery is singing tenor through his nose. 
For he's dramatic, he's lunatic, he is clean gone off his base, 
His father and his mother say he is a 
Celebrated Case, 
He says he takes the cake, as an actor he beats them all, 
Next week he plays Julius Caesar down at Solomon Duff's 
hall. 
Then it's little, &c..

FISHER, 24 Vesey Street, N. Y.. 
I 
know a 
pretty little girl, she lives just down the street, 
If you see her when she's out walking, you'll say that 
she is sweet. 
Tier mother keeps a 
grocery store, 
Her brother drives a 
dray, 
Her father is a 'longshoreman, 
And she tends store all day. 
CHORUS. 
Her name is Biddy Ann McCarthy, 
her eyes are blue and she is hearty, 
She takes the prize at every party, 
And we call her Biddy Ann, that's h..r name. (Sym) 
We'll married be in a 
short time; what pleasures we will 
share, 
We'll raise a 
little family up , they'll be our only care, 
We'll move ontsiae the city, 
Myself and little wife, 
And with our children, ever near, 
Be happy all our life.

Woras by R. E. O'BRIEN. 
Sung by W ILL H . 
MORTON. 
When telling that same ancient story, 
That's new since the days of the ark, 
That soul thrilling moment of pleasure, 
That gleam of love's light thro' the dark; 
Our hopes and our fears are all waiting, 
One word from a 
fair maiden's lip, 
If " no " all the world is a 
desert, 
If " yes" life's best nectar we sip. 
CHORES. 
Our hopes and our fears are all waiting, 
On word from a 
fair maiden's lip, 
If " no ' all the world is a 
desert, 
If " yes" life's best nectar we sip. 
A 
blessing, just then, is a 
baby, 
Who comes as if sent from above, 
To say to our sweetheart that really, 
"What we call ' espect, he calls love;" 
And when the sweet damsel surrenders, 
Excuse for most exquisite bliss, 
The quiet remark of the young one, 
"Whoever I 
love, why, I 
kiss." 
(Chorus) 
"Ah! babies, though mar- plots, you're jewels," 
If one has the talent to take 
The proper amount of advantage, 
Of all the queer blunders you make ; 
And many a 
lover has reason, 
To bless for the whole of his life, 
The infant whose timely intrusion, 
Compelled him tn r-gic for his wife. 
(Chorus).

HER HEART WAS TRUE TO ME."—(Ooncluded.) 
2 
We'd not set sail six weeks or more, 
When lor, the winds began to blow; 
For Mary Anne my heart felt sore, 
I 
wished myself at home with her in Pimlico. 
The sea behaved uncommonly rough, 
To the gallant " Timbuctoo," 
And gave her a 
shock that sent her on a 
rock, 
All amongst the Chunkumchoo, 
'Mongst the horrid Chunkumchoo. 
SPOKEN.—I 
very soon discovered that these interesting tribe of 1? 
gel's were in the habit of discussing grilled man 
breakfast, uial 
pickled Grandmother for dinner. I 
never expectected to see the one 
Cno.—Who's heart was true, &c.

They made me captive, dressed me up 
In nothing but top boots, feathers and paint, 
You would not be surprised to hear, 
I 
felt so queer I'd nearly faint; 
Their interesting Queen proposed 
Her husband I 
should be, 
But as she'd nine, I 
begged to decline 
Her making the tenth of me, 
Very kind, but not for me. 
Srmi-Es.—Beside, why shiver my jibboom and capsize my binnacle, 
hadn't I 
already one 
Cno. —Who's heart was true, &c. 
4 
One day from the sweet Chunkumchoos, 
I 
took to my heels and off I 
ran; 
Contrived to reach dear America's shore, 
Bushed off to find my Mary Anne. 
I 
soon beheld the one I 
loved, 
Also her children three; 
And her husband, oh lor 
showed me the door, 
Said " there was no room for me," 
He " regretted" he'd no room for me. 
SPOKEN.— Why, why was I 
noe served up at a 
Chunkumchoo break, 
fast ? sooner than to find myself deceived by the one who said 
Cno.

She'll sing and she'll dance to the old mill clack, 
And the song that she sings " Will my love come back," 
Till her old grandpa with his long white hair, 
Laughs aloud till the tears down his cheeks run clear; 
And the lads in the village they know right well, 
Inat a 
charmer exists in that rustic dell. 
I 
love her all the better, its a

How my heart goes bump when I

That we both first met in the new mown hay, 
She looked like a 
rose with a 
delicate blush, 
Or a 
sweet water lily all among the rush. 
I 
sighed, " Pretty Polly, what a 
witch you are° 
And she said, get along, or I'll tell Grandpa." 
She's just like an angel that sweetly sings, 
I 
should really think she is, but she's got no wings.

Then we march'd down to supper 
In 'ristocratic style, 
The coaches on the outside 
Would reach an Irish mile; 
The company assembled 
Were the pride of our city, 
The solid men from ev'ry ward, 
Were at Higgins' Coterie. — Ref.

Reporters from the " Herald," 
The '' Tribune,' and the " Sun," 
Took the names of all the ladies, 
Just when the ball begun; 
The Haloys and the Daleys, 
Myself, and Nell Mc' Gee, 
Were paraded in the papers, 
From Higgins' Coterie. — Re!

There was Burns, the big distiller, 
M'c Bride, the alderman, 
And a 
wealthy Cuban lady, 
With diamonds on her hand; 
She walk'd around the ball-room 
Like a 
queen of high degree, 
All the wealth was represented 
At Hig,gin's Coterie.— Ref.

At six o'clock next morning, 
The band played " Patrick's day," 
In horse-cars and in stages, 
The crowd all went away; 
It pulverized poor Higgins, 
And kill'd his family. 
He's living on free lunches 
Since he gave the Coterie.—Ref.

WHAT legi us f 
friends always bless us, 
When golden success gilds our way, 
how they smile as they softly address us 
So cordial, good humor'd and gay. 
But, oh ! if the sun f 
prospority 
Has set, then how quickly they frown, 
And cry out in tones of severity, 
Kick the man, don't you see he is down? 
CHORus. 
So let all your hearts be honest and true, 
And do unto others as you'd have them to do; 
Sickness and sorrow u.ay lull unto you, 
So lift up a 
man when he's down ! 
What if, when you had not a 
sorrow 
Your heart was as open as day, 
Your friends when they want.d to hollow 
You'd oblige, and ne'er ask them to pay 
What, if then, a 
friend you ne'er slighted 
You wander about through the town 
Your friend became very near sighted 
And don't seem to see you when down. 
CIIICIRUS.—S0 let all your, &c. 
Then give me the heart that for ever 
Is free from the world's selfish rust, 
And the soul whose high, noble endeavor, 
Is to raise fallen men from the dust. 
And when in a.:versity's ocean, 
A 
victim is likely to drown, 
All hail to the friend whose devotion 
Will lift up a 
man when he's down !

LITTLE darling, do you miss me, 
Wand'ring from your cottage door? 
Do you linger there to kiss me, 
As you did in days before? 
Is your gentle heart repining 
For the joys that once were thine, 
With my arms around you twining 
And your little hand in mine. 
CHORUS. 
Little darling, do you miss me, 
As you dream of days before, 
Do you linger still to kiss me, 
By the little cottage door? 
Little darling, do you miss me, 
Roaming by the streamlet tide? 
Where I 
whispered as I 
kissed thee. 
You were more than all beside? 
Does sweet memory returning, 
Bring again those happy days, 
With the never ending yearning, 
For my lips to speak thy praise ? 
Little darling, eta 
Little darling, do you miss me. 
*Do you long to hear my voice, 
Breathing words so sweet and tender, 
That would make your heart rejoice? 
By and by I 
hope to greet thee, 
As I 
did so long before, 
Are you waiting still to meet me. 
As you've done in days of yore ?

SONG AND DANCE. 
As sung by the FRENCH TWIN SISTERS. 
My heart it is so full of love, 
I 
don't know what to do, 
If I 
could only see that girl 
That I 
saw dressed in blue. 
While walking out one evening, 
My heart did palpitate, 
For passing by her house, I 
saw 
Her standing at the gate 
CHORUS. 
She is the sweetest ever seen, ( Break.) 
And dresses like a 
queen, ( Break.) 
Her hair it hangs in ringlets, 
And oh, such lovely eyes; 
If ever I 
should marry her, 
You bet I'd get a 
prize. 
I 
called around next evening, 
All dressed in clothes the best, 
With patent leather heeled boots, 
A 
nice silk hat and vest. 
We walked and we talked together, 
Until it was quite late, 
And bidding her a 
sweet good-night 
I 
left her at the gate. 
She is the sweetest, & c. 
So now we're to be married, 
Oh, what a 
happy time; 
An invitation I'll give all 
To come with us and dine. 
So now I'll bid you all good- night, 
I 
haven't time to wait, 
For I'm a 
going round the corner 
To meet her at the gate. 
She is the sweetest, &c.

Jump in, jump in, my Kitty dear, 
We're going to have a 
sleigh- ride, 
The night is bright and cold and clear, 
It's going to be a 
gay ride. 
Thro' Ce'ntral Park and Harlem Lane, 
We'll soon be swiftly speeding, 
Jump in, jump in, my Kitty dear, 
The race we'll soon be leading! 
Sleighing on a 
starry night, 
Dashing thro' the snow, 
Full of laughter and delight, 
Singing as we go; 
Rosy cheeks and laughing eyes, 
Tales of love they show, 
Sleighing on a 
starry night, 
Dashing thro' the snow. 
I 
care not how the wind may blow, 
I 
care not how it freezes, 
My little girl is at my side, 
And don't she get some squeezes! 
Our sleigh is dashing up the road, 
And gay the bells are jingling, 
While eyes are bright and hearts are light, 
With love and laughter mingling. 
Sleighing on a 
starry night, etc. 
I 
ask my Kitty is she cold, 
She softly whispers " Yes, dear!" 
The only comfort I 
can give 
Is just one sweet caress, dear! 
I 
talk of love, but Kitty thinks 
The time is not well chosen, 
She says, " My darl:ng, mind the horse, 
My feet are nearly frozen!"

If I 
Catch The Man Who Taught 
Her to Dance. 
Written, composed and sung by Wm. J. SCANLON, in SCANLON & CAON1N'S 
famous sketch, entitled " Life in a 
Tenement House." 
I've got a 
daughter I 
talk to all day, 
But the devil a 
word will she mind what I 
say, 
In spite of advice she'll go far away. 
Sometimes she cannot be found. 
If I 
say stay at home, begorra she'll get mad, 
She'll call me an ould tad, say I've got them bad, 
Inside of an oyster I 
ought to be clad, 
To a 
nannie goat I 
ought to be bound. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, but if I 
catch the man 
That taugnt her to dance 
The la-de-da dance, the tra-le-la dance, 
On the top of his nose I'll make my fist prance, 
And twist off the both of his legs, ha, ha ! 
Repeat.) 
At night she'll put on her fol-de-lol-lols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand calls, 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll wear my coderie pants, 
My chin-chilly vest, or anything by chance, 
But if I 
catch the laddie-buck that taught her to dance, 
twist off the both of his legs. 
(Chorus.)

PAT WON'T GO HOME TILL MORNING. 
Composed and sung by J. II. RYAN, now nerforming with Merchant's 
Panorama of Ireland, as " Rory the Rover." 
THE dawn upon the hill was breaking, the stars were twinkling 
in the sky, 
As Pat upon the ground lay dreaming, his big shillelah lay clos-
by, 
All night the whiskey he's been drinking, and now he wakens 
from his drunken snore, 
He calls for drink to make him frisky, and swears because there 
is no more. 
C 
HORD'S. 
Then fill up the bowl, hurrah ! for a 
thirsty soul, ha! ha! 
An night on .a 
spree, my boys, my throat with fire is burning, 
Dance so blithe and gay,hurrah I 
none like Pat can be, ha! ha! 
Divil a 
hair I 
care, my boys, we won't go home tili morning. 
The, moon upon the bogs was gleaming, and the lambs were 
bleating in the shed, 
rite pigs and sows the swill are raking, and the gossons waking 
to be fed, 
Pat home from the wake is trudging slowly, with divil a 
farth-
ing in his purse, 
Besides his pockets are both holey, and credit to poor Pat not 
worth a 
curse. 
Then 1111 up, 
C. 
rbe night and fun again advances, and the song and dance 
again goes 'round, 
And Pat again is nimbly drinking, until with whiskey he gets 
drowned, 
MI night he's been swigging at the bottle, and now he tumbles 
flat upon the floor. 
Yet still the boys and girls are dancing, but Pat's asleep ta 
dance no more.

Delia on the Trapeze. 
IRISH SONG. 
Written by Wm. J. Scanlon. 
I 
have a 
charmer, she's my alarmer, 
Oh, what a 
pleasure to have such a 
treasure, 
I 
call her baby, she calls me deary, 
We pass all our time in a 
most pleasant way. 
When we're out for a 
walk the young men do say 
As we pass them by in the street, 
Look at Lynch and his mash, don't they cut a 
dash, 
Don't his darling look charming and sweet. 
CHORUS. 
But you should see Delia 
When on the trapeze, 
She'll stand on her head 
And she'll fall on her knees, 
She is a 
daisy, sets them all crazy, 
They laugh and they shout ' till you'd think they 
would burst. 
,Repeat.) 
I 
brought my brother, his wife, and her mother, 
To the theatre, so they coulc mat( her, 
When she came out you'd think they would ate her, 
They shouted and yelled it a

When poor Delia heara i

The N. Y. Evening Nail writefe. 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. 
FISHER'S, 98 Nas 
mu street, called the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining 
how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiat the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." . 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat ifttle 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the told-

for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an • 
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. Th.: 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

i7ourting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which mio•ht have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the dill 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The .ientiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
