Dear Dr. Re s
erdez;
 
It is my understasrding that t
he poessibilitp exists for Professor Vermin P
terreraa
 
to be promoted to the rank of full professor.  I offer this letter in enthusiastic
 
support for rrofes sor ferrera °
 s promotion
 
I have known Ferrera for Ipprorirrate17 eight years, and have lone aenlr8
.d his
 
dedication to three thfnns -
-- his family, his harp, and his Community.  As to his
 
harp playing, I can a
a
a
saure you that he excells, and over the vearR he has become
 
one of the mast
 skillful a
cne s
nidely appreciated Mexican hnrnists in Southern
 
California.  Pit has performed on courtleaas occasions in hixs region of the country,
 
ana his stature in the nation , arena has been recognized through *19 invitation
 
to perform in national events such es the Smithsonian Iniatitution's veastival of
 
Ararican Folklife and the National Polk Festival at prestiplous WbIftrasp Auditorium.
 
In addition, h
as has been well received at region=l conferences and concerts in
 
other parts of the L
Tniterl States (Minnesota, for exavPle) and,
 of
 c ourse, in Yexico.
 
Further testimony is the fact that be is One of the only two penale to receive
 
two apprenticeship grants from t
he rational rndowment for the .
arts to study with
 
a maoter traditional a
artietas.  Nerreraa's f
inal descriptive report W
 accor
 ali
.sh-
rer
_to during
; his study period were as impressive as to w
arrrent rMli
.ny an exception
 
to normal fundin; policies of our ProRram.
 
l
ie dedication to the betteraent of his Chicano commun
i
ty in inseparable from
 
(
thou Rh pore inclssaive than) his musical activities.  Pe has enlivened many a
►
 
cultural event with big r"siciarship, spreadine than messare of one of the most
 
powerful forms of Mexican cultural expression -
-
-e musica i
aarochaq.  Alone with his
 
lone list of gratis ;
performances in benefit of community causes, Professor lerrera
 
adds
s  a tellinv, sensitive explanation of the history, cultural significance,
 
and aesthetics of this „one of the most im
mnortanr
_ of ?
!Pxican musical tra�iitiona.
 
I feel Professor Fermin lerrera deserves the highest encomiums for his rusiciaanship,
 
devotion to cammunity, and nrofessori
,al competence.

Thank you for yourrletter of November 11 to our FOIL Arts Program.  It vAg Food
 
to hear of your plans for the cultural awexrenesn and educational project.
 
It is difficult to give YOU a detailed responses t
o your proposal letter, other
 
than to say that there mpv be some possibility for support through our program
 
for some of your
. activities.  We focus a mood deal
, of attention on the traditi
.o K
 
ality and excellence of the artists involved in project proposals, and we would
 
need to hnav pore about the artists involved to given you an accurate readin^ on
 
your chances in the grant eampestitbnn.

s not eroughttime to get a grant out by then unless
 
you lowerwyour request to W

of the review process, known as a Abairrar'& action."  Also, i
t would be my
 
guess that the Teatro de  1a Tspereanza ray qualify for funding under the %deywment's
 
Theater Program, but not under the yolk
. Arte Progran guidelines.
 
I suggest that you get in touch with me by telephone to discuss your pinns, t
he
 
artists, and t

together an application.  I tried to contact you by phone this veep, but there

Dear !
f

Thar!

: you for your rroposal of W
lovenher ?5 to our Folk Arts Progr am.  In
 
general, your plans seem nhund and clearly exr
-Ta med.  rnclosaed are t
!
-
.
.e
 
appropriate application forms.  Though our neat application deadline is
 
January 1
, if you need an extra two weeks or so to get the forms to us, it
 
should cause us no Frent Inconvenience.
 
I have one question and W M
 so m-e3stion for you.  Will the recordinp
.s be don,-
In the studio or will they be field recordings?  In either case, ve will need
 
a sample illustrating the technical excellence of the recordist.  An%!, we
 
need, by February 15, a 987 mle* of Abre of the musical rmteria 1
. that you want
 
to include in the album, if at all Possible.  Even If You have some informal
 
recordings done with a
t ho w cassette machine, this would be most helpful.
 
The suA!testion is that you do All  y ot1  cAn to come d
enn on the request to the
 
N
TFA.  In the past, we  `
s
alve funded a
elbusrs at a r
aaxi*aL ,
 1lvol of about A7
,snn,
 
and In theses cases, they were producing at least 1
,CY10 records.  I rellize
 
this nay be difficult, but it would probably be very r
±uch to your advar
,tag
:e
 
to stev In the range of oast f
.
.un?
!in¢ as much as nasaaible.
 
Along with the application form and tape samples, Please 1nelude resumes for
 
yourself, Dave Fvans, and any other of the key pro
_'ect personnesl, and a
 
tentative listin7, being as specific as nossible, of the contents of the album.
 
Tf You should have any further questions, please feed free to contact me by

 Arts Presentation at rebruary Council
 
There are s
a couple of preliminary considerations:
 
I
.  Dolt►
.
. Arts has been operating with two-year guidelines.  Therefore,
 
w
ee have not had an opportunity to ennale the Council in a substantive discussion
 
since yehrnary of 1910.  Similarly, there are a number of Council members who
 
have never Participated ir a for m
al review of the folk Arta Propran, during
 
KI M then could see the thrust one the shape of the whole effort.
 
2
.  f
or proposed 1983-4 guidelines repraspnt extensive rewriting aW
 
re+arganizatlon, but are not charged inaaraq really substantive manner from
 
the old guideltres.  I would therefore anti
.ctrate that Council guideline
 
review would be mostly pro forms.
 
I mould l
.
ik
.e tbia time to prevent to the Cour!eil the picture of the Volk Arts
 
Progrsars as I see it -- as a
t Yeas3ty, daring, experimental, Improbable attempt
 
by a major nation to do what r
s
aslor nations have never every thought of wanting
 
to do before -
-- to keep their little* t
exts, their local arts, their special arts,
 
their culturally even divisive arts nlive, 80 developing, and
! triumphant.
 
Excellence is excellence, if you're n
aaintinp eggs of if you're painting the
 
ceiling of the Cisatinee Chapel.  And t
ape3clalnees4 (individuality) is specislress,
 
if you're Andy h
Karhol or the l
ast living l
taiseno basket maker.
 
I have been talkinn all this over wi
.tb Polk Arts 5pe*cialists t
han Sheehy and
 
Bob Teske for :
some days.  G
3e are planning a l
imited slide/tape presentation,
 
not merely a show--and-tell session. but ornanixed around a series of problems
 
we have confronted anti t
he strateyis+ss we have developed for approaching them.
 
The problems include:  l
) t
he maintenance of standards of excellence in
 
situations; where the art form is unfamiliar to the nene!raal audience and to
 
the critics:  2
) the scarcity of stable, a
 s
ophisticated, experienced, and dedicated
 
institutions in the folk arts f
ield. 3
) J
unta to cer-RMIcate with an individualistic,
 
non-institutionalized, unorganized constituency of local chair w Kers, hammer
 
dulcimer players, and solo ballad s
ainve!rs• and several other issues of similar
 
concern.

A Federal agency advised by t

National Council on t

rts
 
Thank you for your recent letter regarding possible Folk Arts Program
 
support for an exhibition of the works of Carl Peterson.
 
While the slides accompanying your letter suggest the quality and style
 
of Peterson's carving and sculpture, T am afraid that without further
 
evidence of his participation in a familial or community tradition of
 
carving or sculpture, our panel would regard him as more a "naive" than
 
a "folk" artist.
 I don't mean to downplay the nature of the work in
 
anv way;  indeed, I think Peterson would have made an interesting local
 
addition to the Walker Art Center's important exhibit of "Naives and
 
Visionaries."  However, under our current guidelines, I doubt that our
 
panel would feel comfortable identifying Peterson as a folk artist.
 
In light of the improbability of Folk Arts support for this exhibit, I
 
would recommend that you contact Mr.  Seymour Rosen regarding other possible
 
sources of funding and regarding inclusion of Mr. Peterson's work in the
 
survey being conducted by Mr. Rosen's organization.
 He can be contacted
 
at SPACES (
Saving and Preserving Art and Cultural Environments), 1804 North
 
Van Ness, I
.os Angeles, CA  90028.
 I have included one of the SPACES'  press
 
releases for your information.
 
I have enclosed the slides which you were kind enough to share with us,
 
and I trust that you will feel free to contact me should you have questions
 
regarding this project or others relating to the Folk Arts Program.
 In
 
addition, I wish you all the best in identifying other sources of support
 
for this fascinating exhibit project.

Dear Mr. Feldman:
 
Thank you for your recent letter regarding possible Folk Arts Program
 
support for a thirteen-week series of radio programs featuring the
 
traditional music of Wisconsin as recorded by Helene Stratman-Thomas Blotz.
 
This project, both as described in your letter and as outlined by Nancy
 
Stearns of your staff in several phone conversations, seems well
 
thought out and sharply defined.  As an effort to increase awareness
 
of the traditional arts among those groups which have supported and
 
shaped them,  the radio series falls well within the Folk Arts Program's
 
guidelines and ranks high in its broadly defined priorities.
 
I am enclosing copies of the Folk Arts Guidelines and application forms
 
for your use, as well as a checklist of the supporting materials it would
 
be helpful to submit with your application.
 Of most importance, perhaps,
 
are the detailed treatment of the series of programs and the sample of
 
previous work.
 
Should you have any questions regarding the requested materials or other
 
aspects of the application process, please feel free to contact me at
 
202/634 6282.
 I look forward to receiving your application for the
 
January deadline.

Dear Marina,
 
Bow very nice of you to write me_
 I had wondered from time to time about
 
your family and yourself and hope) that all was going well for all of you.
 
I shall enclose R brochure that describes whst I
'm doing ns of the moment.
 
I
't both exciting and ironic that you're working with t
ime support of the
 
California Council on the Arts.
 I
've tried rany times to turn them towards
 
putting* a folklorist on their staff, bu so far to no avail.
 
To catch you up with the; test of the family, rore7 is rarried and l
i
_vinb
,
 
in Vancouver, Cana
W she has two odopted children -- 11 and I years old,
 
and both she and her husband are teaching in the Vancouver pul)lic schools.
 
They seem very happy, and I
'm looVinyt forward to spending Christmas with
 
them.  Naomi completed her PhD at Berkeley in Physical Anthropology one is
 
living in Paverhill. Massachusetts with her husband, John
. Bia op (
a film-maker)
 
and their two children, aped 5 and 3
.
 So I
'm a grandma four times over.
 
Rick, Who is living in Amherst, Massachusetts has failed so far to add to
 
the Hawes line but he has turned into the family's only full-time musician
s,
 
playing everything 1ncludin¢ fiddle, piano, button accordion -- you name it --
and calling contras and square
. Knees.  Fe r
e
takes a precarious l
iving like
 
most musicians, and has turned into a fine field worker on the side.  He may
 
become a folklorist yet.
 
As for t
ae, I
'm not sure what the immediate future holds.
 So far, the folk
 
arts nropram has survived the varionss hud7et cuts, but who knave what's
 
coming down the pike next.
 I haven't sold the Santa Monida house y
_et, so
 
that's a cus % n apainit 1zy  possible return to the vast.
 
I was vary interested to readiin more detail in the UCLA newsletter about
 
your work.  You might want to think about applying for some federal assistance
 
for some of your projects.
 In that case, don't hesi tate to give me or '
fan
 
Sheehy a call; the way you work it is to telephone 2?2-634-4281 person-to-
person collect, and we will return your call on the federal line.
 
All the best, and do alve your parents my very best regards when you write
 
them nest.

Dear Anna,
 
The enclosed magazine has ar article on Italian needbavork that stems from
 
an apprenticeship project that Folk Arts fundeA last year.  The author was
 
the apprentice; she lines in t
'ashington anct needed trhvel mpney to visit
 
with her grandmother in Went Virginia, and also wanted to be able to offer
 
her an honorarium.  Ve suggested that she write up the project, and she did,
 
and here it is.  I thought you would like to see it and possibly get in touch
 
with the author of Mrs. reluaso! and them I tboukht you might forward t
he
 
article along to ,
Anna Collesa
a
.no with vy compliments.  In fact, I
'll enclose
 
a little note from no to Anna.  It see m to s
ee the article might give the
 
Buffalo folks some ideals not only about apprenticeships but how to do articles
 
and such about their own ;
artisans.
 
I intend to try and get in touch with Joan Savereano and s
c
r
ee if her rrasndmother
 
has a record player: if so, V11 r
est her a
s copy of your Calabrian record.
 
I hope everything
: is going well

Affectionately.

From:  Bess Lomax Hawes, Director
 
Folk Arts Program
 
Subject:  Full Time Position for Patricia Makell
 
A year ago when Richard Keeling was hired on in a full time slot, I had
 
frankly, forgotten that our program Secretary, Ms. Patricia Makell, was
 
on a 3
9 hour a week part-time basis.  It really was unfair, and I am
 
wondering now if I can repair the injustice.  Since Richard is no longer
 
with us, would it be possible to move Ms. Makell into his old full time
 
slot?  She has worked for Folk Arts with diligence and distinction since
 
April of 1979; she is a GS 7 step 4
, and our only clerical worker.  We
 
need her on board and happy!
 
I
've mentioned this to Charles Yixon and he says he sees no ob.lection if
 
it's all right with you.

 None
 
Concerning 414, every staff members spends much time consulting on state or
 
locally based folk arts program problems, putting people with similar
 
projects in touch with each other, and performing a variety of coordinative
 
functions for a field that has no true service organizations.
 
A final procedure we're not sure is covered:  Our Grants Officer,
 
Rose Morgan, maintains an on-going calendar on which she posts the dates
 
when funded projects will occur; this calendar is used for sending out site
 
visit requests.
 I
'm not quite sure where these functions would fall, but
 
perhaps that will become clear at the training meeting.

Dear *
4r. rhee.
 
Ibrink you for your letter concerning the r
.
.rOPOSed First Annual Navajo '
Nation
 
Concert.
 By now. you should have receivers a COPY of the
. Folk Arts brochure -
--
(
I shall enclose another in case the mails have failed us).
 It appears to me
 
that the Folk Arts Fro^ram would be unable to help ivad the performance you
 
plan since a vooi part of the event i
ts not a
+
.rts-related and a f
lood ranr of the
 
performances are not traditional.  A further difficulty is that our ravel
 
recotmenes the funding of first-time events only under the rarest circumstances.
 
Have you thought of applying to the Fxnansion Arts Prosraar at the Arizona
 
Commission on the Arts one Bumanities7  The person to speak to there is Larry
 
Moore; he's a nice fellow a
and I am sure will do his best to be helpful, he is
 
located at 6310 '
North Seventh Street, Phoenix, Arizona  M
14,  (
607)255-588A.
 
It's often easier to pet local support thnn national: there is so little
 
federal coney available these days thaat we br
ave to apply our guidelines very
 
strictly.  '
Ve have had the pleasure of supportingt several Navajo nation Projects
 
in the oast, rarticulaarly a project designed to get older traditional artists
 
to work
. with €
 e
aadstart youngsters before they left the reservation to eo to
 
outside schools.
 
Please circulate our brochure to otners In vour office, and if a project
 
develops which fits under our guidelines, we'd be del
.lRhted to try and help.
 
I
'll Also be glad to tnik with you about where to refer other Navajo cultural
 
projects.
 
With my very best wishes for success in your search for funds,

MEMORANDUM
 
November 19, 1981
 
To:
 Chatrman Hodsoll
 
From!  Bess Lomax Fawes
 
Subject:  Proposed Funding Levels for FY 1983 (
11/19/81)
 
My notes from this morning's meeting as to the rationales for the various
 
funding levels are somewhat confused.  However ; looking simply at the
 
difference between the lowest and the highest levels (
levels I/II and level V
)
 
and thinking exclusively of the discipline programs, it appears to me that
 
this budget projects a markedly uneven growth pattern from program to program
 
that does not square with the statement that the pain has been relatively
 
evenly distributed.
 
The relative percentage of growth from the 88 million level to the 1
49 million
 
level ranges from 7
9% for both Inter Arts and Media Arts to 30% for Literature
 
and a bottom-line 2
7% for Folk Arts.  Inter Arts is a special phenomenon.  The
 
large programs such as Music and Museums, being large to began with, can
. spread
 
the pain out more thinly: as Ezra pointed out this morning, a small increase Is
 
relatively meaningless in his field
..  I do not say the same for mine, nor, do
 
I imagine, would David Wilk for Literature.
 
An even further skewing of the budget toward the more highly institutionalized
 
disciplines is evident when one considers that Challenge and Treasury funds,
 
neither of which are much use to the small programs, are back in the budget
 
and additional t
o the figures cited above.
 
My own sense of what has happened is that we have not yet corrected from the
 
1981 budget which was purposefully constructed to assist the major institutions.
 
The theory at that time was that in 1982
., a correction would be made by paying
 
especial attention to individual artists and smaller institutions.  The overall
 
federal budget restrictions have left our 1982 budget in confusionv but we are
 
still projecting about the same proportions, program to prograrr, that we used
 
in 1981.
 
As we project into 1983, allocations f
or the major programs are thus increasing
,
 
geometrically at the expense of the smaller programs.  Theo Rikel and several
 
other Council members attempted t
o call attention to and correct this at the
 
June Council meeting, if my memory i
s reliable.
 
I realize, of course, that what I am taking for a somewhat disastrous arithmetical
 
confusion may represent instead a policy decision.  I did think, however, that I
 
should bring the above information t
o your attention.
 
November 13, 1981
 
To:  Gary Wallace / Budget
 
From:  Bess Lomax Hawes / Folk Arts Program
 
Subject:  Overtime request
 
Folk Arts will have a panel meeting December 10-12 (
Thursday through
 
Saturday).  In addition to a full days meeting on Saturday, the panel
 
is scheduled to work Thursday evening for three to four hours, probably
 
screening film and video samples.
 
Support staff is further required to set up the meeting
, room each day
 
and to clear up afterwards.  This generally means coming in by 7
:30am
 
and not leaving
, until 6
:00 or 6
:3npm.
 
I understand that overtime money must be especially requested and is
 
limited to GS 9°s and below.  I should like to request that Patricia
 
Makell, Program Secretary and Rose Morgan, Grants Officer, be authorized
 
to receive overtime pay up to 15 hours Bach during the above meeting.

Dear Bill:
 
Fees has been tied up of late in s
catters concernin" our t
ransition of administration,
 
so I am t
aking the liberty of responding on her behalf to your letter of September 1
.
 
In general, Kuh ns project plans seem both sound and a fresh approach t
o An
 
under researched topic.  As you may know, however, our program's support of
 
publications is very limited, usually taking the form of subsidizing authori-
tative descriptive motes for s
ound recordings, informative programs for
 
festivals, or catalogues for exhibitions of traditional crafts.  Books s
uch
 
as the one planned by Mr. '
Fuhn and even songbooks have been turner: down
 
unanit-ously in recent times by our advisor•
,' panel, so I do not look for z
 
change
s in this policy in the forseeable future.  If anything, given a reduced
 
budget on the horizon, I look for a stricter application of our Puldelir
_es.
 
I wish I could offer ware than moral support, but I regret to s
tay that I
 
cannot be optimistic at this time as to funding possibilities.
 
Sincerely,

As far as Folk Arts is concerned, we are a
lready r
_onsultina with the Smithsonian
 
Folklife Center (
Ralph Rinzler) in a project that Sid Yates suggested:
 
specifically, to re
 President Roosevelt's concert for the King and
 
Queen of England which was emceed in part by my brother and which featured
 
American folk music.  From the original cast, at least some of the original
.
 
cast (Marian Andersen and Lily May Ledford, lead sinner of the Coon Creek
.
 
Girls) are still available: other possibilities include Josh White Jr. and
 
Burl Ives.  Brother Alan has been contacted and is willing to help out.
 
I
've talked
. with Ralph about all this.
 Is there something else we should be
 
doing?  Is there some way in which this should be handled in order to get a
 
little Arts Endowment p
.r.?

Dear Mr. Dauenhauer:
 
It was good to hear in your letter of August 23 that things were moving along
 
well with the Alaskan Orthodox Liturgical "uric p
roject.  It's especially nice
 
to let good news like that these s
tays.
 
io answer your first question, we have a
lready put through another t
ime extension
 
until Movember 30, 1981, and you should he hearing from our Grants Office any
 
time now.
 
Aa to the forwarding; of the 50 tapes, Joe f
fictrerson at the Archive of American
 
Folksong tells me that they prefer to receive the original of the field recording"
 
and make the archive copies themselves.  Our office will need to reviev the final
 
product of the grant, but we have no '
f
acilities for permanent archiving.  So, T
 
suggest that you send the master tapes to us for review, we will forward theca to
 
the Library of Congress for copying, and then will return the originals to you.
 
Does this plan seen acceptable?  The riskiest part probably is the transportation
 
of the tapes via maid, so if you know of any trustworthy acquaintance coming
 
this way, you might consider having them delivered in person.
 
If you have any further questions, feel free to contact ne by t
elephone.  If
 
eau call me person-to--person collect at 20216'4-4??2 and leave your
' n
er
ve and

Dear Joan Lolmaugh,
 
Thank you so nuch for your warm letter inviting me to meet with the I
daho
 
Commission on the Arts November 12-14.  1 expect t
hat b
y now Barbara Fahr
 
has spoken with you concerning the conflict between Your weeting and that
 
Of the 3ational Council.  I do feel so bad about i
ts I would line so much
 
to meet with your Co
 isssioners, and also to take advantage of your offer
 
to stay on a few days and get acquainted with Idaho, a state I
've never had
 
t
ree privilege of visiting.
 
Perhaps ve could work in a visit later on this year or next.  Cm1d you and
 
Barbara code up with another date?  I think almost anv other time would be
 
quite manapeablet
 
 
Actuall
y, I euPpose it's possible that postponing MY visit until after the
 
unceming *
rational
. Council Meeting might have one positive result: enabling
 
me, perhaps, to answer some questions that I would now have to simply guess
 
at.  T
le area certainly is a confusing
. period.  A few additional weeks should
 
help us have a better notion where we are going► and what kind of financial
 
and moral support we have bacl
,�ing us.
 
I do hone your programs are coming along well.  If I can he of any help, please
 
let me know, and I will look forward to hearing a future e
late a
-ben I can,
 
perhaps, visit.  With my very best wishes always,
 
Cordially,

It was nice to hear from you.  I hope everything is going well for you.
 
I
'm sorry, but I have had to make a flat rule that I will write no general
.
 
letters of reco mendation as lon^ as I hold a position an a federal officer
 
in a
e granting agency.  The possibilities for misunderstanding are s
imply too
 
great, and so I don't writs letters supporting either people or projects.
 
I do wish you the boat of luck, however.
 
Feve you seen Anna Chairetaki
.s recently?  She is still working with the Buffalo
 
aeonle from t
ime to t

hat she
 
knows in Queens, and Now Jersev, and '

recordings that she made: they're quite special, I believe.
 
Again, all zy beat vishe

Dear Dr. Vennum:
 
Pursuant to our recent telephone
. conversation, I offer my opinion in writing
 
concerning the exceptional professional credentials of ethnomuisicologiast
 
'
Pierre Kazadi we Mukuna.
 
Z have known Dr. Mukuna for approximately eleven years and have long been
 
impressed with his scholarly and linguistic skills.  Pis research on African
 
survivals in Afro-Draziliaa music and twentieth century African bighlife runic
 
is perhaps the most significant to date on the topic.  The research tools he
 
brings to b
ear on his work are top notch -- he has performed several years
 
of field research in Brazil and Africa, he i
s f
luent in f
our languages, and he
 
brinr
,s the native African perspective to beer in his work.
 
In short, Mukuna is certainly one of t
he most distinguished scholars in his
 
field.  l
ie is a fine researcher and a ware affable human being.  I wish him
 
the best of success in obtaining the neeeesenry view to enter the VniteO States.
 
If you or anyone else should have any fortber questions concerning my knowledge
 
or opinion of "1r.  Muluna, please do not hesitate to get in touch by telephone at

Thank you so much for the invitation to the Conference on Anthropology and
 
American Pluralism.  I shall be delighted to attend.  However, because the
 
Wenner Gren Foundation is a potential grantee of the National Endowment for
 
the Arts
 (
indeed, I believe there may be an application pending), I do not
 
believe I should accept the financial assistance the Foundation so kindly
 
offered me.
 
I shall, then, attend the conference, and I will arrange my own transportation
 
except that I should like to join the group that is taking the bus from the
 
hotel to the conference the morning of October 29.  We can arrange later how
 
I can reimburse the Foundation for the per diem expenses incurred during the
 
conference.
 
Again, my sincerest thanks for being included in this event that I believe
 
will be so stimulating.
 I shall look forward to seeing you there.

Dear P
is. Kel
,eacian.
 
I understand f
rom Anna Chairetakis that you have left your position as Vice
 
Consul of the Italian Povernment in New York,  I ar s
orry not to have reached
 
You before, but perhaps this letter gill find its way to you on Your now
 
assignment.
 
I simply wanted to tell you that several nez
ibers of the i
tallan community in
 
Buffalo mentioned to me their particular del i
ght that you both attended and
 
made a ;
public address at their folk arts festival, the Scampagnata, in upstate
 
New York.  Some of my friends in the Italian community in Brooklyn were also
 
honored by your attendance at their various concerts of authentic I
talian folk
 
music during t
he spring of 1980.  The Folk Arts program of the Natlonal Endowment
 
.
for the Arts was happy to sponsor ane to be of some small financial assistance
 
at all the above occasions, but the nartici
.pation of such honored guests as
 
yourself h
el
v
e make these affairs infinitely more meaningful in the eyes of
 
the participants.
 
I would imagine that there were many demands s
hade on your time during your tour
 
of duty as Vice--Consul in New York City, Lut there could hardly have been more
 
meaningful ways to use your efforts.  Your cooperation with the Center for Ethnic
 
Arts and similar or7aniaations was an inspiration t
o the Italian-American folk
 
artiste and artisans and the Folk Arts Program vents to convey to you our
 
appreciation for your help.  I
t is all too rare, sadly enough, that governmental
 
officials can cormminicate with each other through their 4

Dear Alan,
 
Here
- are two items for you to take a
s look at.  !
hie is the brochure describing
 
C-FAG (
Consortium of Facific Arts and Cultures, the thing Roy Nelms i
s adminis-
trative director of).  The other is a brochure put out I believe by the govern-
ment of Australia that tells a bit about the last South Pacific Festival of
 
the Arts.  This is an activity shared in by the various governments (
see the
 
:
pan on the reverse side); it happens every four years and the next go-round will
 
he in 1996 in New Caledonia, I think.  The
y Hawaiians and the Saexoaxns and the
 
Micronesians rot awfully mad at the NY-4 the last go round because we didn't
 
have honey t
o send them to last year's event in Papua '
iew Cuinea; so one of t
he
 
things Roy Nelms and I have been
. working up is some way to start planning for
 
this a bit earlier on.  Anyway, I thought you'd like the pictures.
 
I think
. you're probably right.  This rarticular bureaucracy may well do a good
 
bit of damage.  We can easily shin out of talking with t
oy, but we should do
 
it pretty soon, since he plans these trips months in advance.

Dear Bank,
 
It is a pleasure to inform you that a national me a
ting of State Folk
: Cultural
 
Coordinators will take place on October 21, 1981 at the E1 Tropicano Motel in
 
San Antonio, Texas at 8
;00 pm.  Planned to immediately precede the American
 
Folklore  Society Meeting, the €athering of Coordinators is jointly sponsored
 
by the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, the Polk Arts Program
 
of the National Endowment for the
. Arts and the Folklife Program of the
 
Smithsonian Institution.
 
Topics to be considered at they Coordinators' Meting include a number of projects
 
currently,in early stages of development, including the rolklife Center's
 
"IntaantAble Aspects of Historic Preservation Survey" and a
s survey of the status
 
and needs of traditional craftspeople in the United States, as well as status
 
reports from the various federal agencies involved in supporting folklife.
 
Because of the range of issues being
; considered and the importance of staying in
 
close communication with both academic and public sector folklorists, I would
 
strongly recomm-
nd your attending the meeting in San Antonio.  Both prior
 
national meetings of State Folk Cultural Coordinators have proven helpful and
 
informative, and I expect this meting vi?
-1 be as well.
 
Looking forward to reel a
g you in San Antonio.

Grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities
 
Walter Anderson
 
During 1980, Folk Arts received no applications from any of the institutions
 
listed.  During 1979 and 1981, oddly enough, we received applications from
 
both Howard University in Washington, DC and Hiles College in Alabama, some
 
of which received positive and some negative recommendations from the Folk
 
Arts advisory panel.  But nothing in 1930.
 
During 1980 we had three distinguished Black scholars on our panel, two of
 
whom are teachers, Dr. Councill Taylor (
SUNY-Old Westbury) and Dr. William
 
Wiggins (
University of Indiana).  The third, Worth Long, provides consulting
 
services out of Atlanta for Black institutions and arts groups throughout the
 
south.  He has worked with several of the listed colleges and institutions
 
but has so far not referred any grant applications to us.

SUBJECT:
 Annual Report on Implementation of White House
  
Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities
  
I.
 BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
 
Under Executive Order 12232 initiated by President Carter all
 
Federal departments,  establishments and agencies,  are required
 
"to implement a major Initiative designed to achieve a signi-
ficant increase in the participation of historically Black
 
colleges and universities in Federally sponsored programs.
 
Through this Initiative,  Federal agencies  (
are expected to)
 
identify,  reduce,  and eliminate barriers which may.  . .have
 
limited the opportunity for Black colleges and universities to
 
participate in and benefit from Federally sponsored programs."
 
(
The preceding quote is from the Implementation Directive from
 
President Carter, which followed issuance of the Executive
 
Order.)
 
The responsibility for monitoring the Directive was assigned
 
to the United States Department of Education.
 Consequently,
 
on November 3,  1980,  all Federal agencies were sent copies of
 
the Implementation Directive detailing the requirements and
 
NZA Program and Division Directors

time lines to be undertaken by each agency to meet the mandates
 
of Executive order 12232.
 Each agency was asked to:
 
(
1)
 appoint an agency representative;
 
(
2)
 appoint an Agency Liaison person; and
 
(
3)
 report data and information to the office of the desig-
nated Director of the White House Initiative on Histori-
cally Black Colleges and Universities located in the
 
Department of 
•
 •
 
Chairman Biddle appointed June Harrison as the Endowment's
 
Liaison person and me as the Endowment's Representative to
 
remain in communication with the Department of Education for
 
the purpose of 
• - -
 •
 
Thereafter a number of complications ensued,  and I shall try as
 
best I can to present them for your understanding as follows:
 
1.
 A draft report on goal setting and implementation strategy
 
in respect to plans 
•  Fiscal Year
•: 
_  • - to have
 
been submitted to the Department of Education no later than
 
December 1
,  1980; and a final report was to have been sub-
mitted by December 15,  1980.
 Additionally there was to have been
 
a review of the agency's performance for Fiscal Years 1979
 
• 1980.
 (
My hunch is that the review reports
• 
• have
 
served as background against which comparisons of projected
 
goals for Fiscal Year 1981 could have been made,  though
 
I have no  facts
• substantiate
 
NEA Program and Division Directors
 
Sebtember 4,  1981
 
Page 3
 
2.
 But as we all know,  concurrent with events referenced above,
 
there was a Presidential election in November,  1980; and,  as
 
the Memorandum recently received from the Department of
 
Education verifies,  "The transition in our government
 
changed virtually all of the agency heads, many of the
 
agency representatives and some of the agency liaison
 
persons causing discontinuity in our process.
 Many of
 
the agency reports,  therefore, were never submitted to us."
 
3.
 Among those agencies which did not submit a report was the
 
National Endowment for the Arts.
 A few of our own compli-
cations made the matter still more complex.
 For example,
 
November 22,  1980 the National Council on the Arts recom-
mended to the Chairman that a Division of Human Rights be
 
established at NEA as a broader program in replacement of
 
the former office of Minority Concerns.
 The Chairman con-
curred and appointed A. B.  Spellman as Acting Director.
 
Problems of goal setting and performance review of NEA in
 
relation to Historically Black Colleges and Universities
 
should properly come under the purview of the Division of
 
Human Rights.
 
4.
 However,  a number of practical problems with which the
 
Endowment as a whole has been greatly preoccupied in the
 
past several months have interfered with the ability of
 
NEA Program and Division Directors
 
September 4,  1981
 
Page 4
 
the Endowment to set up the new program with the additional
 
personnel which would be required,  etcetera.
 
5.
 Also,  it has not become clear to me whether President Reagan's
 
Executive Order of January 20,  1981,  abolishing standard
 
Federal agency regulations, would have any immediate effect
 
on the Implementation Directive based on Executive Order 12232.
 
6.
 President Reagan during the Campaign of 1980 took the position
 
that the Department of Education in its current form should
 
be retrenched.
 Furthermore,  in the recent past,  it has been
 
reported in the press that Secretary Terrel Bell has recom-
mended the dissolution of the Department of Education and
 
allegedly has prepared a number of options, which take into
 
consideration reassignment of the Department of Education.
 
Thus it is within the context of the complications enumerated
 
above that I am attempting to reply to the recent request for in-
formation from the Endowment.
 My assumption is that so long as
 
the Department of Education maintains an office for the White House
 
Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities,  the
 
Endowment should make a bona fide effort to supply information as
 
requested.
 However,  since the Endowment has no set goals in regard
 
to these particular institutions,  I am taking the liberty of sug-
gesting a simplified format for reports from Program and Division
 
offices.
 
• Program 
• Division Directors
 
Sevtember 4,  1981
 
Page 5
 
But before I suggest reporting procedures,  I
'd like to clarify
 
some definitions below:
 
(
1)
 The implementation Directive defines "Historically Black
  
Colleges and Universities" as"those institutions of post-
secondary education that were originally founded for the
 
purpose of providing educational opportunities for indi-
viduals of the  'Negro or Coloured'  race, which continue
 
to provide postsecondary education opportunities for
 
Black Americans by enrolling
 
 •
 of
 
as students"  (
and which are listed in Appendix A of 
this
 
"Historically
include
 Black colleges and universities," however,
 
according to the Implementation Directive,  "are to be
 
distinguished from predominately Black colleges and
 
universities which 
 institutions of 
• -  edu-
cation
 
according to the latest Higher Education and General
 
Information Survey Report."
 (
Emphasis added.)
 
(
2)
 "Barriers" mean regulations,  procedures,  practices or
 
requirements which have the effect, whether or not intended,
 
of limiting or precluding the participation of historically
 
Black colleges and universities in Federal programs.
 
(
3)
 "Federally Sponsored Programs" mean all programs and activi-
ties sponsored by Federal agencies in which colleges and
  
universities are eligible to participate, including, but
 
not 
-• to,  such activities
grants,
•
 pre-
and
 
recruitment,  faculty - staff exchanges,
•
•.-
 -
 
education,  internships and other similar programs.

Using the list provided in Appendix A,  code in the infor-
mation requested in the three columns to the right as such
 
information applies to Fiscal Year 1980:
 
A.
 Number of Applications Received

2.
 Step 2:
 
Designate guidelines categories for which it would be ap-
propriate for Historically Black Colleges and Universities
 
to apply for assistance.
 A simple listing will suffice.

Basically the Endowment's Legislation instructs that support is to
 
be extended to professional arts organizations and individuals of -i►-
exceptional talent.
 Consequently,  the number of grants which go
 
from NEA to educational institutions on any basis is limited.
 It
 
thus is understandable that responses to the request for informatio n
 
will be predicated on the agency's basic charge and the policies
 
set forth in guidelines.
 However,  it will be helpful if you have
 
any suggestions for the benefit of the Endowment or the Department
 
of Education.
 
Although the Department of Education request for a report set a
 
deadline of August 15,  I have spoken with the office of the Director
 
on the white House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and
 
Universities to advise that the Endowment's report will be delayed.
 
There was gracious understanding of the pressures on us.
 I ask,  if
 
possible,  that reports from your respective offices reach me within
 
14 ;
*
 
a week.

Dear Virginia,
 
This is just a personal note responding; to the article you and 1
1r. Watman wrote
 
on "cashing Out the Intimate Details of Ethnic Culture."  The copy before me was
 
sent me by the Idaho State Folk Arts Coordinator.  I have several other copies
 
as well, forwarded for my interest by people from other :
sections of the country.
 
You surely get good coverage.
 
That hein; the case, I feel particularly sad that you used your important forum
 
as you did.  It happens so many tit
tles:  ward-pressed people so often choose to
 
lean on their friends rather than their enemies, perhaps because they believe
 
they can count on their friends to hold still for the treatment.  And so here
 
we go again -- the pitifully small handful of people in the country who care
 
the least bit about ethnic culture (
of which I
'm one) read pour article and
 
wind up more neurotic and unsure of ourselves than we already were:  the Smithsonian
 
folks a bit less willing to stick their necks out, the folklorists a bit less
 
willing to got "involved" in public sector activities.  They were suspicious
 
enough already.
 
Did you happen to read Secretary Ripley's article tin the Sr
.ithaonian some mouths
 
ago when he practically called for a return to the melting pot theory and
 
implicitly chided the Folklife festival for presenting "polyglot  cultures on
 
the Nati mal Nall
.?  Vhy didn't everyone sve&V English, he enquired, at the
 
Festival?  (
I am paraphrasing, not having his article in front of me, but it was
 
truly a frightening series of statements from a person of his stature.  I wrote
 
hire a letter of protest concerning his attack on bilingualism, and he anmvered
 
me most politely but didn't tatze back a single word.)
 
We have real
_ enemies.  We are in extremely difficult times.  Surelv you could
 
have
. foen3d a really j
,xd festival to criticize publicly in a national publication,
 
instead of one of the few that is mal_ingx a serious effort to do the lob well.
 
And why a thole article of
, criticism anyway during this desperately depressing
 
summer?  Isn't this a time to try to help each other keep our spirits u
p and
 
our courage high?

Dear Ys. Varga,
 
Thank you for your letter of early June regarding possible Folk Arts Progren
 
support for activities of
. the Hungarian Civic Association of New Brunswick.
 
Your letter arrived just before our bast panel meeting of the fiscal year, so
 
we held it for consideration under our 1982 deadlines.  I sincerely hope this
 
has not caused your organi%aticm any serious inconvenience.
 
With regard to the proposed projects mentioned in your letter, I would recommend
 
submittingq an application for t
'he embroidery classes for our October 1
, 1981
 
deadline.  In addition to the completed application forms, copies of which I am
 
including for your use, we would greatly appreciate your providing the info m
satinn
 
indicated on the enclosed checklist.  I would recommend not submitting an applica-
tion for the Association's annual festival due to t
he heavily administrative
 
nature of the expenses our funding would r
y
e
s to support.  Ordinarily, our Advisory
 
Panel prefers to fund expenses for artiste' f
ees, field research and program
 
booklets in conjunction with festivals.
 
I have spoken with Kalman M
asgynr of Hungarian Folklore Centrum in Passaic, and he
 
has indicated t
hat he would be pleased t
o assist you in preparing an application
 
if you so desire.  Mr. Magyar has been funded through our program in the  past
 
and is thoroughly familiar with our procedures.  T would also be happy to provide
 
any assistance I can, and would be happy to discuss the proiect with you over the
 
phone.  If you call m
ss collect at 202-634-4282, I will be happy to return your
 
call on t
he WATS line in order to save you a little money.
 
"
Thank you for your interest in the Folk Arts Progran, and I look forward to
 
receiving your application in the next few weeks.  Si ne we were extremely late
 
in responding to your reply, please feel trees to take some additional time
 
beyond the October 1 deadline if necessary.
 
Sincerely yours,

Pear Dr. Dead:
 
Thantk you for your proposal of August 2
5 concerning your idea for a festival of
 
local music and dance in honor of North Dakota's bicentennial.
 
My first reaction to your proposal is that the budget is very much on the high
 
side in terms of our program.  The general range of Folk Arts grants is between
 
$5,000 and $25,000.  In addition, we tend not to fund first-time festivals,
 
particularly very large ones such as yours.  On
. the other hand, your plans may
 
be considered to be an exception
s to this latter policy, since the bicentennial is
 
an exceptional occasion.  In any case, i
f you plan to apply to us, you should
 
work toward scaling down your plans to be less ambitious and less expensive.
 
Another important area of concern i
s the incorporation of adequate cultural
 
expertise into your plans and the effective integration of expertise into t
he
 
presentations.  We would need a restcse of your consultant(s) and the exact role
 
of that person in the festival.  If members of the ethnic communities themseslveea
 
are contributing -
materials, you should have some scholarly validation of their
 
efforts.
 
Also, we will need a list of artists, along
: with biographical material and a
 
samples mudiota
 a of their performing, to accompany your application.
 
Enclosed Is a copy of our application fora..  If you decide to apply and have any
 
further questions, please feel free to contact me.  I
f you call s
it person-to-person
 
collect at 202/634-4282 and leave your name and number, I will return your call
 
as soon as I am able.  I will be on vacation, however, until Septenbe►r ?1, so if
 
you need to g
ent in touch before then, you might call my colleagues Bob T
eske or Dichard

Thank You for your proposal of A
..
-pust 10 to the Folk Pits Program concerning
,
 
your plans t
o continue collecting Latvian ethnic nusic for your archive.
 
As you :
nay see from the enclosed Folk
. Arts Ruidelince, we tend aot to fund
 
collecting projects that do not have a strong dissemination effort written into
 
the grant project plans.  I
f, for exarple, you were to propose to produce a
 
series of radio programs on traditional Latvian music with expressions of commit-
sent from radio stations to play t
hem, that would be more in line with the type
 
of documentation project that we have funded in tha past.  ,
As it appears in your
 
letter, though, you have not developed the plannin7
c to that point.
 
Another important issue is the distinction made under our program guidelines
 
between traditional and the more inclusive term ethnic. All
. that is ethnic is
 
not traditional, and all that is Latvian music would not necessarily f
it within
 
our progatmatic definition of traditional.  I refer you to the enclosed guidelines
 
for more co Mlete information.
 
This is all not to say that there would not be any possibility of funding some
 
projects that you nay have in the nlanninp, and if von would like to rursue
 
the matter further, please feel free to get in touch either by mail or by telephone.
 
If you call me person-to-person collect at 202/634-4262 and leave your name and
 
number, I will return your call as soon as I a
re able.

Derar Kin,
 
I just came across again your letter dated June 25, received herd July 16.
 
Since we
. had, in the intervening period, talked by short-wave (always a heady
 
experience for me making me dov
-nright blabber-mouthed). I had somehow forgotten
 
to answer your letter point by point.  I
'm sorry.
 
First things first.  A combined salt and pepper grinder is on its way.  I hope
 
you'll like it.  Ponape pepper smells and tastes simply divine, and if the grinder
 
never makes it to you, I would recommend bashing the peppercorns in a
3 mortar with
 
a pestle or a hammer or something.  It's too good to keep on a shelf.
 
Now, on to less important matters.  Polk Arts has indeed assisted in the production
 
of LP records, our support being specifically reserved for research expenses and
 
fees, performers' fees, and album booklet research, design, and production costs.
 
I don't see why a project of Chamorro poetry reading would not be of interest.
 
I would think the English translation would be unnecessary on the record itself
 
but could be Included in the booklet.
 
Dan Sheehy suggests that if you proceed with this project, you might want to 
think whether or not the reco rd album  format
 is the best one for netting the music
 
and poetry back to the people.  T
eo lots of people on Saipan et al have record
 
players?  Might tape recordings (
cassettes) be better, or how about doing the
 
whole shooting match in the form of radio programs; for broadcast?
 
When you're in Hawaii for the SEA! r
weeting, be sure to see the double record
 
Petty Tatar did out of the Bishop 1
!useum collection of ancient Hawaiian chants,
 
originally recorded by t
felen Roberts onto cyllinders.  It's a beautiful album;
 
we helped with some of t
he costs and it might give you some ideas.
 
I wonder if t
he airport project has core into being.  It sounded like a worthwhile
 
position.  I
'm sorry t
here is no cultural heritage program development as yet on
 
Saipan; the crafts council movement around here has slowed considerably due to
 
budget stringencies.  As for Folk Arts, we're still hanging in and on as i
s the
 
rest of the Endowment.  The next two or three months should tell the tale; the
 
President's Task Force on the Arts and Humanities is scheduled to report by the
 
first of October, and Chairman B
iddle'sa terra expires by the f
irst of November.
 
Until then, nobody knows quite where we are.
 
I will probably not see you at SEM, but Richard Keeling and Possibly Dan Sheehy
 
will be there.  Rave fun, and I hope the Agharubw Dancers are a smash hit.

We will be getting new guidelines out early next spring, providing we are

Dear Mr. Feaney,
 
Thank
; you very much for your letter about your project With Fred Liebe man.
 
I am also very ,
glad you are going to work with Fred, and will hop
_
 a that we
 
can help out.  If we can't, perhaps we will be  able to find some other funding
 
source that can.  I
've spoken with Fred about the whole idea, and we will begin
 
to work hard on it together.
 
I am enclosing, for ;
your interest, a copy of the brochure that explains the
 
Folk
. Arts Programs.  I think you will recognize some of the people in the
 
pictures, especially Elizabeth Gotten, who I believe has sung at some of the
 
general festivals you have appeared at.  I heard you, bu the way, a year ago
 
or perhaps it was two, at the :
National Folk Festival in Wolf '
Trap.  You were
 
simply splendid, and I am so glad that you have finally agreed to write down
 
and further record your songs and stories.  You have a great gi f

Dear Steve,
 
Thank you so very much for the nice letter from Mr. Whitenack.  It cheered
 
up the whole staff for a whole c
lay.  We also got a rave review of the:
 
festival from Bob Garfias; perhaps you've gotten a copy of that already.
 
I am sending you, under separate cover, a token of r
ay esteem.  You've
 
really done such a fine ,
fob.  I
'll hope to see you in San Antonio but
 
whether or no  let's keep in touch.

Dear Vanessa,
 
I am sorry to be so long in responding to your letter.  I have been advised
 
by the administration here that they think reprinting ar article from the
 
Endowment Annual Report would not be appropriate for your Festival Book since
 
we are not at this time funding t
he Festival.
 
I am, of course, honored to be asked to contribute to the festival Book
., and
 
I have been trying to think of something; else I might have written that would
 
be appropriate.  Perhaps you would want to use an exerpt from STET' IT i
 OWT,
 
the book on Black children's ga
ses that I co-authored with Mrs. Bessie Jones.
 
MACE should have a copy anyway, and I shall take the liberty of sending one
 
for your library under separate cover.
 
Please give Muddy Waters my very warmest greetings, and wAy I extend to you
 
my very best wishes for a
s successful festival.
 
Cordially,

Attached please find my edits for your article in the forthcoming Cultural Post.
 
They are pretty extensive; the problem is that we have had a policy meeting
 
since the May Council, and the panel did not do in August what they said they
 
would do in June.
 (
Sounds like a song title, doesn't it?)
 
I also enclose a small news article written by our summer intern Connie Higden.
 
She was handling the nominations for the Hational Heritage Award and got upset
 
when one of the nominees died while we were still debating just how to do the
 
job best, so she somewhat assuaged her feelings by writing an obit.  I will
 
understand perfectly if you don't use it.

Folk Arts
 
(Grants to individuals X and
 
organizations for the presentation
 
and preservation of traditional arts.
 
Reviewed:  120 applications Requesting
 
$2,423,000.  Recommended:  58 grants
 
totaling $994,000.)
 
The panel meeting took place
 
in early June under the shadow
 
of a possible rescission in
 
the Endowment's 1981 funding.
 
Partly because of this and
 
partly because the Program
 
had received a record number
 
of funding requests,  the panel
 
decided that National Heritage
 
Awards to Fasterful1folk artists
 
should be postponed until fiscal
 
1982. That means the 50-odd
 
nominations received so far will
 
be reviewed at the December panel
 
meeting and the awards announced
 
sometime next year,]
, 
The panel,-however,  remained
 
enthusiastic about this concept,
 
part.icull-l
rly because several state
 
aL"

discussing similar programs which
 
A
  
l
e

could be underway before the
 
E
ridow
inent's own awards come
 
out. This seems another case
 
where an innovativo Endowment
 
program i
nay be more significant
 
for the worthwhile trend started
 
than for the actual grants.
 
In addition,  the panel agreed
 
that while the current application
 
guidell\
�nos have served the folk
 
arts fiel(� well,  tighter, more
 
focused strategies of funding
 
need to be developed in pt
.is time
 
of tightened budgets. The
 
present Folk Arts guidelines,
 
covering fiscal 1981-82,  are
 
considerably more flexible,
 
with
 Agrant categories and restrictions,
 
than the guidelines of other Endowment
 
Programs.
 
For fiscal 1983,  the panel
 
recommended that the guidelines

Dear Lou,
 
I do wish you'd stop taking this grant business as a personal rejection of
 
you and your festival.  '
Nobody is "denying" you anything.  There is a limited
 
amount of money, and an incredibly large number of people and worthy causes
 
like yours who feel they ought to get it.
 
It's true that we hardly ever fund the same festival beyond three years, because
 
there are so many others waiting their turn.  Maybe that's not good policy, but
 
it's the policy we've got and the policy we've been using for the last ten
 
years, and all I can do is tell you what that policy is.  As far as traditional
 
performers go both the Folk Ethnic Program and the Folk Arts Program urged you
 
many times to use local traditional artists.  That kind of programnirg is top
 
nriortty for us.
 
I
'm enclosing yet another copy of our guidelines.  Why not take them to the
 
granting officer at San Diego State and let him help you come in for a small
 
grant for our October deadline that would fit the kinds of things you do that
 
we can fund, not just a general "festival expenses" kind of application?
 
You haven't applied in a long while, and if you want to apply for some special
 
part of your festival, the panel might be interested.  Please bear in mind,
 
though, that the Endowment's budget is beinn reduced and I don't expect large
 
requests to have much chance in these difficult times.  If you need further
 
help call
. me, or '
Richard Keeling, or Dan Sheehy, and we can give you advice
 
over the phone.  The number is 202/634-4282
.; call person-to-person collect
 
and your call will be returned on the federal l
ine.
 
Finally, I
'm sorry but I can't write a letter of support for the festival as
 
long as I
'm a federal officer.  Wait until I retire in the next while, and
 
I
'll be happy to bombard the college for you.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Friends of the SAN DIEGO FOLK FESTIVAL,
 
As you may or may not know The San Diego State
 
University Cultural Arts Board has decided to cut our
 
funding for next years festival from$9,000.00 to$3,000.
 
00 and our days back to Fri & Sat.
 This all coming be-
cause they say we are not drawing people.  While its true
 
our attendance has been down the past 4 years,  it is al-
so true that it was j
ust 4 years ago that SDSU quit appro-
priating an additional $
1,000.00 advertising revenue.  Up
 
to that year we were also recieving additional funds from
 
The National Endowment for the Arts giving us an opportun-
ity to bring out man y o ld ti me  performers living in the
 
East & in general giving us an opportunity to present a
 
wider range of performances.
 Each year since the NEA &
 
SDSU cut funds the first time,  it  -.
,
as been getting in-
creasingly harder to get quality traditional performers
 
& thus w.  inflation,  gasoline prices et al added we are
 
not getting the out-of-town (
or even in town) audience
 
we once did.
 
So last week a few of us got together and talked
 
over a few ideas. First & foremost among these was that
 
the San Diego Folk Festival should not die.  In fact it
 
should be our first priority to bring the festival back
 
to the level of those held 5 years ago.  Several ways were talked about to
 
accomplish this.  FIRST to those of you who can't take an active part local-
ly we ask you to take pen in hand & write th e Un ivers
ity  protesting the cut
 
reminding them of a 1
5 year tradition that should not die.  In fact if you
 
can send a copy ea , of your  letter
 to  the  following

can persuade to write a le tt er  p lease
 do  so.  Anyone
 local
 who would like to
 
be part of a SAVE THE FOLK FESTIVAL COMMITTEE please come to a meeting on
 
Thursday,  June 18 at 7;30 PM at the home of Leslie Satz,  3010 33rd St.  in

The Folk Arts Program of the Rational Endowment for the Arts notes with great
 
regret the death of Chester Cornett, a widely-known maker of hand-carved
 
rocking chairs.
 
Mr. Cornett had been the subject of numerous books and articles and was
 
nominated for a National Heritage Award.  Appalshop Inc. recently completed
 
a film about his work which was partially funded by Folk Arts.  The film,
 
titled "Hand Carved", has been widely acclaimed and was recently given a major
 
review in the Washington Post.
 
Mr. Cornett was born and raised in Kentucky where he learned chairmaking
 
from his uncle.  After serving in the armed forces in World J
ar II, he returned
 
to his home state, where his massive rocking chairs gained the interest first
 
of his neighbors and eventually of collectors and scholars from around the
 
United States.  He moved to Cincinnati in 1970 and continued chairmaking there
 
until forced by illness to retire.
 
Mr. Cornett's work
_ and life have contributed much to our understanding
; of
 
Appalachian folk design and hand carving.

It is with regret that the National Endowment Folk Arts Program
 
notes the death of Chester Cornett,  an individualistic and inno-
vative maker of hand-carved rocking chairs.
 
Mr.  Cornett was born and raised in Kentucky where he learned chair-
making from his uncle.
 After serving in the armed forces in World
 
War II,  he returned to his home state where his massive rocking

Mr.  Cornett was born and raised in Kentucky where he learned chair-
making from his uncle.
 After serving in the armed forces in World
 
War II,  he returned to his home state where his massive rocking
 
chairs gained the interest first of his neighbors and eventually of
 
collectors and scholars from around the United States.  He moved
 
to Cincinnati in 1

by illness to retire.

Re!  A800

I must apologize for delaying so long in answering hour request for information
 
on the Arts Endowment 's Peri.
tage Award program.  :he fact is the entire program
 
was postponed because of the fiscal uncertainties of this ;
cast year , and so Z
 
really don't have the information you requested.
 
The Folk
. Arts advisory panel that reviews our grant applications will be meeting
 
during December of this year to i
aake some final recd  endations on the Heritage
 
Award Program, and I shall be happy to send you an account of the results of
 
their deliberations.  They struggled with just the questions you raise at their
 
last session in August but wish to review the whole issue once more in December.
 
`
:
le shall hope to announce our first awards during the summer
  of 1982.
 
In the meantime, if you get your program off the ground before ours, I hope
 
you will let us know how you do it!  There are certainly a number of highly
 
sensitive issues involved , especially when;
 one is dealing witl:
 native , ethnic,
 
and folic artists.
 
with my very west wishes for the success of your program. I am

Hi.  This is your missing aunt speaking from faraway Washington, sending you
 
and yours love and laying a
x bit of a burden on you, I
'm afraid.  If you don't
 
want it, just forget it or pass it along to whomever.
 
The enclos ed tape and p
.r. materials come from a group I do not know but who
 
were recommended to a
lsply to me at Folk Arts by my old friend Tai Mahal.  I
 
have explained to T
ai r
epeatedly that I am not in t
he business of helping
 
young pop groups get started, but he keeps on trying.  This bunch sounds perfectly
 
good to me, but I really have not kept t
ip with this kind of music and have no
 
idea how they :
could be received by anybody.  T mean, I don't even know if they
 
are avant gardes or moley figs in terms of the contemporary scene.
 
So I thought you might want to give them a listen.  I have no feeling of
 
responsibility for them, except that if they should turn out to be good they
 
ought to get a bit of a '
roost litre any other of God's children.  I have to ld

in the country western scene and they will hear directly fror this individual
 
or not at all.  S

'm delighted that the former is being
 
considered in such a timely manner and that the latter is so well in hand.

, off
 
then -- the tour, the Portuguese festival, and preliminary visits with new
 
projects at the Arboretum

I think we could keep two people vying full tilt even without the SEM meeting.
 
I an beginning to wish I could come, but it doesn't as of now seem to be in
 
the cards.
 
Anyway, I shall

headouarters in New York October 30-31 and wants t

as I thought you wanted, and you should take it from there.  It's easier for us
 
to be flexible than you.
 
By the way, could you possibly send me another copy of the Artforce Special

guided by a number of scholars and cultural workers.  Ricardo Alegria has advised
 
us; so also has Walter Murray-Chieoa and others whose names escape me just now.

Sorry for t

oost of the

spinning down out of the vast and a period of frantic activity ensues.  It's
 
all a hit nerve-wracking, but I have to admit i
t's not such a terrific excuse
 
for getting; behind with the mail.
 
Anyway, I enjoyed your long thoughtful latter and an happy that t

howed your discussion
 
of t
he Texas situation to Connie Hieden, anti she quite agreed with your analysis.
 
You should consider Polk Arta at your d
isposal in helping, insofar as we can,
 
figure out what's best to be done next.  As for a meeting, Bob Teske and I
 
will probably both be in San Antonio for the A

trip to Houston and Brownsville, I thihk

I am sorry to take so long responding to the copy of your July 31, 1981 letter
 
to Brian, but you ask such hard questions that I
'm afraid I have tended to let
 
your letter drift to the bottom of my "Bess, for heaven's sakes, get on with
 
this!" pile.
 
There just aren't any rules or standards for compensation to traditional artists
 
when they are the subject of documentation filming, nor are there standards for
 
royalty payments, nor do we have copyright recommendations easily available.
 
I do have a few miscellaneous remarks on all these issues:
 
a
.  Two years ago or so, Folk Arts had a few special meetings to try
 
to develop some policies that would guide us in our film and our recordings
 
grants.  These reports are probably a bit out of date, but I shall enclose
 
them for whatever usefulness they might have.
 
b.  Richard Keeling suggeststhat Kammerling must have worked out some
 
suitable agreements with the various Eskimo groups he has filmed; he might be
 
worth getting in touch with.
 
C.
 I think a letter addressed to Alan Jabbour at the American Folklife
 
Center, Library of Congress, Washington, DC  20540, might be worth a try.
 
Alan has gone to several international meetings on the subject of copyright
 
and might have some reports that could be useful to you.  Write him about
 
point #2.
 
d
.  And while I am thinking about the Folklife Center, their media expert
 
is a fellow named Carl Fleischauer.  He is very Germanic and thorough and
 
meticulous and might be of real help on your hardware issues as well as some
 
of the other technical questions on video tapes (
a and b under "Distribution
 
issues and videotapes"). I doubt he'd know much about the other issues you
 
raise.  A separate letter addressed directly to him might produce the best
 
results.
 
e
.  Concerning copyright rules, as you may know, there is a brand new
 
copyright law that has everybody kind oP walking on eggs, since it lays down a
 
lot of new requirements.
 I would stron,;ly recommend your getting in touch with
 
the Copyright Public Information Office directly if you have specific how-to
 
kinds of questions.
 
- 2 -
 
f
.  My hunch is that you will eventually have t
o fall back on the position
 
every person working in documentary film/video/recording/radio comes to: you
 
just do t
he best you can to protect the artists' interests and to see to it
 
that some kind of appropriate compensation is made that is immediate and long-term.
 
Circumstances always alter cases.
 Sometimes it's better just to pay a flat fee
 
than to try t
o include a regular royalty payment, for example; we have dealt
 
with cases in Appalachia where the performers never got any payment whatever
 
because "nobody could find them" with their royalties and they hadn't gotten
 
a recording fee of any kind either.  And then sometimes you may want to work out
 
a method of recompense that takes care of the group rather than the individual.
 
We are, for example, repaying a Black chorus by giving them a number of copies
 
of their record that they can resell or distribute as publicity materials; this
 
arrangement seemed more satisfactory to the group than the equivalent number of
 
dollars.  The point is that when you are dealing with traditional artists, you
 
may need to work out all kinds of arrangements in order to deal with the expecta-
t
ions and t
he attitudes t
owards remuneration that may surface.
 
Let me lastly urge you t
o proceed with caution on all these matters, especially
 
in connection with raising artists' expectations.
 It is almost impossible for
 
most people not intimately acquainted with film and record production that every
 
recording artist and film actor is not rich as Croesus.  The fact is, as you
 
well know, that only t
he exceptional case gets anything like "real" money.
 
But as soon as you begin t
o t
alk film with most of the folks, they start thinking
 
t
hey're going t
o be in a major production with a cast of thousands and that their
 
fortune is now made.  We can talk more about this when we see each other in
 
October.
 
In the meantime, I hope things are going well.  Thanks for the informative
 
article on the Hawaiian chant record project.
 It's nice it's being so well
 
received.
 I
'm delighted.
 
All the best always,

Dear Ms. Sherman:
 
Thank you for your proposal of August 11, to the Folk Arts program to document

i sending ,
along the appropriate application
 
forms: as you doubtless know, our next application deadline is October 1
, for
 
projects beginning April 1
, 1982,a
.t the earliest.
 
Along with your papplication, we will need a number of sunportine materials;
 
1
) your resume, and those of any other principal figures involved in the film 's 
production: 2
) an audio sample of Mr. Armstrong's recent performing, as well as
 
samples of his painting, if his painting, activities are to be an important part
 
of the film's content; 3
) a Sample of y
,our filmmaking, with t
he details of pour
 
involvement clearly specified (
e.g., camera cork, producer, editor, and so
 
forth); and 4
) r
! film treatment, outlining the approach and content (
'
for example,
 
will it be a historical biography witb early photos and recordings, or will V
ie
 
emphasis t
ie on contemporary interviews and performances?).  The film sample
 
should be about ten ninutes in length;
. If You mast send a longer sample, please
 
indicate which ten-minute segment you would like the advisory panel to view.
 
The sample should be as similar to the proposed Armstrong f
ilm
. in genera2 approach
 
and content as you can mus
ter .
 
I apologize f
or requestjng such ab!mdant detail; as I a
r
.• sure you l
eave heard,
 
we can expect to be udder severe fiscal restraints during the upcoming fiscal
 
year, and
. I fear that competition for grant monies will be especially stiff.
 
Our panelists will also be looV
.ing for cash in the matching sources for the
.
 
project.  If you can come up with real monev to Patch ours, I think this could
 
by very helpful.

Technical assistance oriented projects s
uch as yours are often scrutinized :
more
 
in second and third year requests, ankh
. since in all likelihood our budget
 
constraints will be greater in the upcoming fiscal
. year, 1 suggest that you
 
include - with your request - a thorough description of the accomplishments
 
during last year's festival, as well as specific plans (
including the traditional
 
artists to be presented) for next year's festival.  Th
ee clearer the idea of t
he
 
festival philosophy vis-a-vis t
he presentation of traditional artists and the
 
format and content of t
he authentic folk component presented in t
he application,
 
the more it vill enable our panelists to accurately evalua te the relstive
 
Importance of the project plans.  Fe as thorough as necessary.
 
If you should have any geestions or problems in co mleting the application

Dear Faustina Rehuher,
 
I am so sorry you have been i

continue well
. In future
..
 
I spoke yesterday to Tare Baker.  We sent the grant letter out of our office
 
on July 28th addressed to the University of G
saass . The next step in for the
 
University of Guam to send a cash request in to us; we will send them the money
 
requested and they can send Dan what he needs to get the project started.  In
 
terms of the money -involved, the university of Guam is new the fiscal agent,
 
not the Palau A
tuata:
!um.  Although you will have a
s major part in
. the artistic
 
development of the project, you no longer have any responsibility for the e
bo ny
 
or the hook-keepin- involved.
 
Dan thinks that Dirk Ballendorf misunderstood all this and aunt the cash
 
request on to you for signature.  If he
: did that. just return it to him.
 
You do not awed to sign anything, and your signature will not help matters.
 
The fiscal part of the grant 1
.
s now the sole responsibility of the University
 
of
. Guam; I see:  to keep saying
: this over and over again, but apparently neither
 
Dan Baker nor Dirk Ballendorf understands this point and it worries me.  We
 
are all so far a
rray frog= each other! the possigi
,lities for misunderstanding
s and
 
misconceptions seem to r
+ultiply with each mi
.1e.  And I am so very anxious for
 
this project to come out veil.
 
Please don't hesitate to vrite again.  I hope you'll keep me informed as to
 
how matters progress.  With all best wishes to you and my other Palaauala friends,

Folk Arts Travel for September
 
Don Moore
 
Via: Larry Baden, Budget
 
Since we understand there are some additional moneys available for staff travel
 
in September, we should like approval of the following actions:
 
a
.  An amendment to Robert Teske's already authorized and obligated trip
 
to Columbus and Atlanta, Georgia, and Asheville, North Carolina.  The
 
amendment would allow Bob one additional day plus travel in Nashville, Tennessee
 
for the purpose of visiting the Edmundson exhibit partially funded by Folk Arts
 
plus conferences with representatives of the Country Music Hall of Fame and the
 
Tennessee State Museum.
 
The additional cost would be $110.
 
b
.  Folk Arts would also like to send Bob Teske to the American .
Association
 
for State and Local History Convention in Williamsburg, Virginia.  The program
 
lists both topics and participants of relevance to the Folk Arts Program; the
 
event is nearby and thus not very expensive.  The event will be attended by
 
state and local museum curators many of whom are interested in developing projects
 
in folk arts.
 
The total cost for attending this conference would be $230.
 
c
.  Our large request is a complicated trip planned for Richard Keeling,
 
which would take him to perform a week-long series of site visits in northern
 
California where we have a number of funded projects and then for a seven day
 
stay in Hawaii where he will attend the Society for Ethnomusicology annual
 
meeting „ review and evaluate the annual festival of the Hawaii Council for
 
Portuguese Heritage, and meet with both Roy Helms of C-PAC and Sarah Richardson
.
 
of the Pawaii Arts Council.  Folk Arts is currently funding some seven projects
 
in Hawaii, and there will be more than enough for Richard to do during a seven
 
day stay in Oahu.
 
The total cost will be $1,346.  We have a
. budget airfare reservation for
 
only $
554 round trip: the heavy cost is the per diem for Hawaii (
$34.00 per
 
day).  Richard has relatives with whom he will probably be able to stay for
 
at least part of the time; however, Travel wants us to estimate the worst-case
 
figure.
 I am sure we will be able to de-obligate some of the above moneys.

Dear Professor List:
 
Bess raves, who is currently much tied up in preparing our annual budget

second volume of music from Colambia.
 
Even though your plans are sound and the materials of s

to say that the Polk Arts Program cannot be of assistance in this case, since
 
our f
unding is limited to the documentation of traditional arts found within
 
the confined of the United States and its territories.  Since your recordings
 
were made in Colombia, this guts the project outside our program guidelines.
 
I have sent a copy of our program brochure with more cowpleste: i

I have also taken the liberty of contacting Dr. Sally `
lerkovich, a folklorist s
 
at the National Endowment for the T

definite category of support occurred to her at the nament, but she asked that

Dear Bernie:
 
Attached is a copy of the % xicsn tour anpl
.ication along with a resuaue of the
 
tour director, Alicia Conzalez, a list of the pool of musicians from Mich four-
teen will be selected for the tour, and a c
assette recording of most of them.
 
At the panel meeting, a revised list of performance sites was given to the panel:
 
Nampa and rocatello, Tdaho; Casper, Che:yeenne, and Roca: Springs, Wyoming; Price,
 
Ogden, and Provo, Utah; Alsmosa, C
olorado: and Billings, V
'onta,na.  This leaves
 
four of the total fourteen performance sites vet to be determined.  Mike 5honeey,
 
the new folk arts coordinator in Colorado, is investifating additional possibilities
 
in his state, Alicia is trying to nut samethinp together in Sacramento. California,
 
Terry Melton s wested Ontario, in eastern Qreaon, as smother, and I wanted to
 
talk to you about northern New Mexico.
 
As you can see from Alicia's resi n, she has considerkb1c
, experience in the public
 
presentation of traditio nal arts.  R
esr work
, for the  1975 Smithsonian Festival of
 
American Folklife ; when i first met her, was superb.  Since theca, she has helped
 
out with several other Smithsonian festivals, the folk consponent of the Carden
 
Theatre Festival in Los Angeles, an exhibit in Texas of family home altars. the
 
South Central
. Lots Angeles folklife festival, and many other similar events.
 
Currently, she is organizing a major presentation of Latin dance forms, entitled
 
"Salsa Picantei "
, for UCLA, involving rer yla ,
 pachuco-style menbo, chachscha,
 
and many other traditional and op
ropular chance types, each to he presented in a
 
simulated typical context complete with live musicians-  It should be treat.
 
In preparation for the tour, Alicia will be responsible for securing the parti-
cipation of the artists, writing the promotional raterials and program booklet,
 
helping plan the logistics, and developing the program itself.  On the tour, she
 
will be the moderator.
 
The National Council for the Traditional
. Arts has committed the use of their sound
 
system, Jeneral telephone and office expenses, the use of their van, and part of
 
their tour coordinator's tire.  If the grant were transferred to another organiza-
tion, they would charge a $
1,500 rental fee for the sound equipment and $500 for
 
the van.  As it stands at present, the "
'
;exican tour is sandw1ched in between two
 
other tours and is pretty much locked i
nto the late-April to early-May t
ime frame.
 
- 2 _
 
.
 
I think this is fine, since it coincides with t
he C
inco de Mayo season.  The
 
NCTA folks have repeatedly told us that the success of the tour is of }
paramount
 
i
r
.m
.ortance to them, even though it :
night mean transferring the grant, and they
 
would be willing
., to assist in any way they caIi.
 
Part of the reason Bess originally contacted T
Jr
,
.STAF about their interest in the
 
tour, was in response to the repeated requests of the '
rational
. Council for the
 
Traditional Arts that she figure out anme way that would allow me to assist in
 
the tour production, since I had put together several similar groups of musicians
 
for festivals at the Smithsonian, the Carden '
Theatre Festival in Los Anr
yeles, and
 
the N tionAl Folk Festival at Wolf :rap.  She checked with our Ce nral Counsel
 
Office here and vas advised t
hat I could take a leave of absence and work on the
 
tour, including receiving an honorarium as long as it did not proceed from the
 
NFA grant monies.  I
, however, did not feel this to he ethical, and offered to
 
work on the tour for nothing during my vacation time.  To do my part, I could need
 
funds for travel expenses only, to talk to the musicians in person (
since many
 
traditional artists tend t
o shy away from strangers and do not put muchhatock in
 
commitments made long distance over the telephone) and to accompany them on the
 
tour.  1
. am not sure their is any way of doing t
his that I would feel comfortable
 
with, but I am willir
_g to give up my annual leave and try to work samethir
.1- out.
 
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I hope to be in Santa Fe in t
he
 
days following Labor Day and plan to give you a call.  Thanks.

Today I spoke with Mirna Yolanda anti

got a general idea of the information
 
The matching portion of t
he grant (
#12-553rd-122) for the crafts coordinator
 
intern totals $11,200.  Most of this is in the form of salaries comaensurate
 
to the time you (project director) and the secretary devote to the project.
 
This does not mean, of course, that Fomento would rued to pay $11,100 more
 
than what they are alread-r paying you and the secretary, it simply means that
 
they agree to allow you and t
he secretary t
o eevote that t
ime to the project.
 
To account for the time, you need to keep a lost of t
he tine spent by yourself
 
and your secretary, showing that the total
. dollar value of that time adds up
 
to $11,inn by the t
ime of the project's completion.  As for t
he reTmlring
 
$
Inn in office supplies, simple produce an accounting of the suprlies used
 
that totals $
110 in value.  It is that easy,
 
If you should have any further cuestions regarding the grant, please do not

Dear Mr. (

As you noticed, we normally do not detail the issues hroiiot t

'
Te
 
do keep notes of the salient points, thoucrh, and often discuss then:
 
over the telephone with the applying parties.
 
In your case, the main issue s
ari one of the artists involved, Don
 
Fields and the pony goys, not coinciding with the scope of our pro-
grar. outlined inonur guidelines  (
see the enclosed brochure) . ^hey
 
seemed to be fine artists and ones deserving of a retrospective
 
documentation, but our advisory panel felt that they wholly fell
 
within the ranee of popular commercial music, and were not strictly
 
traditional.
 
In Making this distinction, there was no opinion a "pessed that
 
the project plans were not sound, nor that Don Fiezlls and his
 
colleagues were not high quality Artists.
 From the notex I have
 
at hand, it was vainly a guidelines issue.

At the recuest of Professor Robert Simon, I an
y sending this
 
letter of reference for F
ir. V
iargarito Gutierrez.
 
I have known Mr. Gutierrez since 1975, when, as a result of
 
field work ?
performed for the '
.*
,ithsonian Institution, I selected
 
his
s to be a ?articipant in the  -mithsonian's Fettival of American
 
Folkl
.ife, held here in Washington, D.C.
 He was a member of a
 
small group of traditional artists representing Mexican culture
 
in California.
 At the .
festival, he proves himself to be an
 
outstanding performer, quite dedicated to the prow
-ation of his
 
own a
.rttstic tradition.
 
Since that time, we have kept in touch regularly.
 in 1978, he
 
was invited by the Asociacion Nacional de Gruuos Folcioricos
 
(
National Association of Folk Groups)  to give a session &n tra-
ditional mariachi music at their annual conference, held in
 
Manhattan, Kansas, that year.  I also participated in the con-
ference, ana I observed him to be a dedicated teacher,  received
 
quite well by his students.
 
The following year, Mr. Gutierrez was invited by the city of
 
San Antonio to offer a similaeeworkshop series at the First
 
International Mariachi Conference.
 I also attended and noted
 
that he was one of the most admired and knowledgeable of the ten
 
workshop leaders.
 
2
 
In short, I highly recoauend Mr.  Gutierrez to teach a course in
 
the perfo =ance of mariachi music.  He is a superb traditional
 
musician, raised and taught in the tradition, any: a fine human
 
bein4 as well.

Dear Bruce:
 
From your letter, it s
 Funds as though things could hardly be
 
better with the progress on the Morns y Cristianos film -- except,
 
of course, for the detail of the shortage of money.
 
on that count, I am afraid that I cannot be the bearer of extremely
 
optimistic nears.
 Bess, as I explain ed to you over the telephone,
 
technically has the prerogative of unilaterally approving amend-
ments that do not exce *d 20% of the total original grant amount.
 
With the recent fiscal constrAints, though, we have decided to
 
send all but they smallest requests to panel for their opinion.
 
The latest reading of our panel is that they are none too sympa-
thetic for film; amendment ree  eats, and less so for the larger
 
grants.
 Yours, believe it or not, is one of our larder grants.
 
when they have approved an amendment, they have: insisted on
 
seeing the closest thing possible to the final product; this
 
usually takes the fo m of a rough edited workprint and accom-
panying wag t=ack.
 
Another strike against you in this case is thajr you show no
 
other cash money up front in the matching ovation of your grant,
 
notwithstanding your goer intentions of getting funds frosr
 
New F
iexico.  I would urges you to do all you can to come up with
 
some other cash from somewhere.
 
Go, I think that your beat strategy would be to put together
 
a stunning samples for out early I
)ecember panel meeting with an
 
accompanying glowing report on the film's progress and the
 
community support that has emerged for your efforts.  This gives
 
you a few months to continue your cash hunting to match your
 
a
rcendwent request.
 
2
 
n
 
As you can 1
probably guess,  things are getting tighter and
 
tougher al-
J the time around here.  My own prediction, based on
 
very little factual information, is that we will sustain a
 
20% to 25% cut in funds,  legs than the 5Or% cut originally recoar
.-
mended for the Endowment at :
Large.  Add in inflation, though,
 
and it comes out to more like a 304% cut in actual 1pouepeyatra*ue.
 
n
t3, if you aGci in an increased applicat ion load, which in ai
 
probability will be the case, the chances are even less of
 
getting a grant.
 This in a roundabout way of telling you toe
,
-do
 
the best and most thorough job possible.
 
I looked into the possibility of getting your ren
.aining grant
 
funds for the r
eoros file
: as soon as possible.  It seems that the
 
next cash request is payable September 1
, only a couple of weeps
 
away.
 If you have Ed Hugetz send in the form as soon as possible,
 
we might even be able to get it out a few c
lays in advance of
 
that date.
 Have him send it to Rose Morgan inoour prograr so
 
that she can give it special handling.
 
Givu me a ca Ll, ?acho,  if you have any more questions or coirment:s.
 
Or, there is a good chance that I will be in Santa Fe sometime
 
between September 4 and 11, so we may be able to get together
 
in person.

MEMORANDUM
 
August 14, 1981
 
To:  Livingston Biddle
 
From:  Bess Lomax Hawes / Folk Arts Program
 
!4V
VJ 
Subject:  Proposed Grants t
o Lettumplay (
grant #12-5530-193, $
5,820)
 
and University of Alaska, Juneau Campus (
grant 412-5530-223, $
26,660)
 
The Council's reluctance to recommend the above grants at the August meeting
 
is most troubling to Folk Arts.  We had felt that both grants served a number
 
of Endowment goals:  both grants were targeted towards making quality art
 
accessible to a wide audience; both grants concerned preserving our national
 
heritage, a heritage that encompasses the artistic contributions of our
 
multi-cultural citizenry; both grants s
pecified the participation of artists
 
of nationally recognized talents and of undisputed artistic achievement.
 
Lettumplay is a Washington, D
.C. based community arts organization often
 
funded through Expansion Arts.  The grant funds were largely budgeted t
o
 
pay the artist's salary.  The artist involved, Charley Sayles, has been
 
featured in Smithsonian Folklife Festival c
oncerts for the past four years;
 
he has performed for President and Mrs. Carter at the White House; his
 
photograph appears on Folk Arts' Apprenticeship leaflet.  Mr. Sayles is a
 
master musician on the harmonica; I do not believe I have ever heard a more
 
virtuoso technician and here I include Larry Adler, t
o whom Pete Seeger and
 
I recently referred Mr. Sayles with a letter of introduction.  In many ways
 
this project was designed to try to get Mr. Sayles some money.  He works
 
often as a street musician, s
ometimes by choice, sometimes by necessity;
 
steady work for a harmonica virtuoso is not perhaps the easiest to come by.
 
His workshops in Lorton have been highly praised.
 
The University of Alaska at Juneau project presents us with an even more
 
serious problem.  The Folk Arts panel had deferred this application from an
 
earlier meeting because they wanted more information as t
o the seriousness
 
of the artistic component and the stature of the artists to be involved.
 
Panel notes disclose that the panel requested definitive information that
 
this would be a residency, not a series of classes, that Native artists of
 
stature would be employed, not "crafts specialists", that there would be no
 
smell of busy-work about the project.  They were more than satisfied.  The
 
list of prospective artists (
one full-time Artist in Residence t
ogether with
 
six additional artists for short-term residencies) includes a number of
 
distinguished artists and artisans of Eskimo, Athabaskan, Tlingit and Aleut

background, one of whom has served on the Alaskan State Council for the
 
Arts.  The art forms t
o be demonstrated include Eskimo cottonwood carving,
 
ivory and soapstone carving, silver engraving, and Tlingit mask-making
 
among others.  Week-long conferences involving several artists discussing
 
and demonstrating Tlingit design and art history, North-west Coast Indian
 
art and design, and Eskimo art history and design attest t
o the seriousness
 
with which t
his program has been planned.  We have support letters not
 
only from prison officials but from artists interested in participating and
 
from native arts organizations.  Our funds are being matched with cash at
 
nearly three to one.  Frankly, I don't know quite what t
o say in a letter
 
of rejection.  This project has been carefully planned t
o meet programmatic
 
and Endowment guidelines, a great number of people have been involved, a
 
great deal of thought and prayerful planning has gone into it.
 
My own belief is that these are good applications, the second certainly
 
stronger than the first, but both of them firmly within Folk Arts' mandate,
 
as I have understood it,  I would greatly appreciate your assistance in
 
this matter at the earliest possible t
ime since 1
931 monies are involved.

_ anaterials compiled to accompany
 
each recording.  Your earlier tapes have been delivered to Carl Rleischhauer
 
at the Folklife Center, and you m
ight address the additional materials to
 
his attention.
 
Thank you main for your thorou Qness in praviding us vith conies of completeo

Thanks for the letter, it was Rreat to hear from you Again.  Tt seems l
ine
 
you "ova around so r
anch these nays that it's Kara to keep up with you.
 
N11a Jakl from the Fresno City government told a
ye that you were interviewing
 
for a joh at Fresno State :
T hone you got it.  T remember your telling a
re
 
that you wanted to get hack there some day.
 
Unfortunately, your letter arrived the first working Oay a
tfter
. our panel Meetine
 
and it was not available for inclusion in the discuasaior
..  Our '
onnel liaten o
, to
 
the tape ane went over tha
t biographical material
_ a
re haZ, and concluded that
 
Tony was indeed a
s fine muzsiclen, but 0
-tat under our current Ruidelines that
 
give criteria for the traditiona3lity of artists, h
at was not the type of artist
 
that we normally fund.
 
T
i
le tend to be more culture specific, that is, for exa m
-le, a mari
.achi musician
 
who is frog
± the particular part of w
est iexico that spawned the narinchi
 
tradition -
-- a hearer of the local culture of whIcb the rmsic is a manifestation.
 
So, we fund jarocho musicians resident in the U
.S. to teach i
atrocho Music,
 
Cajuns to present or teach Cajun music, Pedro Ayala to perforrs con} unto tei1nta
 
M :
sic, and eo forth.
 
Additionally, our panel  recommended fur
:
.dinr
. for an a
 Pplication to support a
 
semester residency at rreano State for Lydia "endoza (
actually we rec
_oam.enc ed
 
the funding
, of the outreach proera ns in the Fresno community) at that same
 
meeting, so she will probably be available for presentations in the city narks
 
and other conrunity sit e
s.  We F
shou M have the final word on this grant in a
 
couple of weeks.
 
Do you have much of a chance to play your horn these days?  I hope no. I h
alves
 
kept a bit busy (
fast enough) with our local r

balances off r

 An the preface affirrs,
 
there are pra;cious few wr.tten or recorded materials available in Enplish or

your work will be m
ac? , appreciated.  Foces will have a prominent place in my
 
library.
 
Your interest in helping out with projects dealing
, g
rit?  dominicanos in this
 
country has by no means s
lipped my mind.  The rain group in New York City that
 
we were working with, hovever, did not turns out to be a good presenter for
 
traditional arts and is no longer our grantee.  And, since our role as the
 
initiator of folk arts projects is greatly lisoited by our wain purpose of
 
responding impartIally to rcrtuersta from the public, I would need to !
lave some
 
exprensior of interest in orpanizing a
! traditional arts activity from the
 
co  unity before being able to send someone in an a consultant to their plans.
 
If th is does materfalise (
aced I hope it does soon), you will be one of the
 
first people T would contract for advice.  I very much appreciate your interest.
 
The topic of developing a traditional arts prograr% of some sort in California
 
that you bring
, up in your letter happens to be a source of Q
reat disappointment
 
art. frustration for me.  I happen to be a Californian, ton, and the intransigence
 
on the part of the California State Arts Council in refusing to address
 
traditional arts in that e
state in any system
-
 stic way burns r
re personally to
 
no end.  I have had talks with the exec{ttive
. director and with the pros ram
 
director, and a group of concerned folklorist s an d et hnic community 'representatives
 
in the state have vressure4 the arts council to do something, but all was to no
 
Avail.  This is particularly frustrating in l
ight of the fact that they could
 
easily apply to us for funding of a state folk arts coordinator's salary, at
 
least in part, for up to three years, but still, t
bev Sb M7 no interest whatsoever.
 
Frank-ly, I have all but given up an them.

The next best things going on in California are a folk arts coordinator position
 
at the Colden Cate Park Recreation Area in San Francisco (
currently held by
 
M ans Drayton) and a couple of festivals in tos Angeles, organized by folkIoriFsts
 
Beverly Robinson and Alicia Conzaalez.  '
these are accomplishments to be proud of,
 
but California is such a big state
r t
hat t
here could be a lot more happening
 
than there is at present.  Other People working there
., by the way, are folklorist
 
Cone Bluestein at California State University, Fresno, and ethnamusicol
.oyiast
 
Robert Bravn at the Center for Vorld Music in San niesao.
 
Bess enjoyed rpadi
.nR your letter to her and asked that I send you her b
east
 
regards and that I let you know that she too will Peep you in mina.  She has
 
been an overwhelmed in coping
, with all the recent proposad bud¢et cats that
 
she has not been abler to stay on top of her correspondence as much as she would
 
like.
 
Again, it w

Near Mr. Platt,
 
I
t was a
s pleasure s
peaking
, with yo" Lest Friday.  You will find enclosed t
he
 
copy of the application for a traditional crafts survey that was submitted
 
to t
he '
Polk Arts Program for consideration by the National Council for the
 
Traditional Arts.  As you will recall, Fllen Lovell of our advisory panel
 
suggested that t
his project a
light nosssIbly be funJable t
hrough National Crafts
 
Planning Project moneys.  Ulth the permission of t
he project director, we are
 
t
herefore forvarding the application to you.
 
The staff of the Folk Arts rrogram, and a number of panel members as well
.,
 
feel this project could provide a valuable supplement to the work of the
 
National Crafts Planning Project.  In addition, a survey report of the nature
 
described in the application would be especially t
imely i
n light of t
he upcoming
 
I
nter-American Year of the "
rafts t
o be proclaimed bq the Qlanizat
.ion of
 
American States in 19R'.  FocusseA upon t
he traditional rather than contemporary
 
crafts, t
hey OAS project will brinp t
ogether both craftspeople and administrators
 
to discuss problems and their potential solutions confronting craftspeople
 
t
brough-out thy+ Americas.  A recent national survey of the position of the
 
traditional crafts in the L
tnited States would be a valuable basis from which
 
t
o proceed.
 
Both Joan McLean and W orah *
'
_Dore have been informed of the survey project
 
application and of our intention to f
orward i
t to t
he NASttA Board of Directors
 
for their review.
 Both
. have felt i
t could be a worthwhile addition t
o
 
t
he Crafts Task
. Force's efforts .
 
If you have any gvestiors regarding the application

Dear Mr. Colon:
 
Ys. Beliasna Klesyneye:r at the National Fndowmeent for the PuManities has forwarded
 
to we a copy of a proposal you subrAtte4 to them for consideration.  As I
 
believe Me. Kle'ymeyer told you, she felt that the folk
. Arts program here at the
 
National ?ndownent for the
. Arts was better suited for your needs.  I tend to
 
agree with her.
 
Enclosed I am sending
, you a copy of our Prograim ruidelines, which delineates
 
the limitations of our program and explains how to apply.  ,
As you will note, we
 
place great emphasis on honoring and assisting traditional artists (
in most
 
cases, senior practiorers who are a
riong the best representatives of their
 
respective tradition).  This includes the funding of situations in which authen-
tic traditional artists (
see ?ul
.delines for explanation) pass on t
heir knowledge
 
and skills to other m
embers of their own cultural comrsunity.
 
If you have presentations of a more interpretive! nature, such as workshop
 
performances with an informative, dducaational component. In mind, I would suggest
 
strongly that you bring someone with considerable expertise in t
he tradition
 
involved into your plans.  Dr. F
a
eactor Vefra or Professor Luis Manuel Alvarez of
 
the Cniversity of Puerto Rico, among others, might be Appropriate.
 
Our next deadline is October 1
, f
'or projects beginning April 1
, 1482, at the
 
earliest.  I would recommend, however, that you first send t
ae a narratives pro-
posal, a letter describing your revised project plans, a
s tentative hudeet out
-
line showing the amount of money to be requested from
, us a
anl what it will be
 
spent for, and the mource of your s
natching funAs &M fn-Vind contributions.
 
The next deadline for this is August 15.  This will allow you the opportunity
 
of receiving maximum feedback on your plans from our staff.
 
In the r
+eantime, if you have questions, feel free to contact me by mail or
 
by telephone.  My number in V
a:
shington, i

Dear Arnold:
 
Well, I an finally ready to write to you about the two a
 ariaschi manuscripts.
 
I didn't have the earlier manuscript on hand while I was reading yogelquist's
 
pie
rce, so I will not make any direct part-hy-}cart comparisons.  Actually, r
+v
 
impressions remain the s
ane as before, and I do not think a detailed compa3riason
 
is where we should focus our attention.
 
In my opinion, Fogelquist's writing is t
he better in terra of the selection
 
of material to present, documentation, ddawinp upon the most up--to-date researcl^
 
on msriachl -
-- in short, in just about every way.  `
!ark, after all, has mule
 
the #ub ject the focus of serleassreseareb associated with ble doctoral degree
 
for over ten years.  Over and above that, he has been a practicing full-time
 
musician of mariachi music for about the same period of time.
 
As I mentioned lefore, you nevertheless might want to taVe into consideration
 
the potential long-tern payoff of encouraging the young r
oan in Rouston to
 
continue his work in r
aaripachi music by accepting his manuscript instead.  At
 
his particular poin in time, I cannot say that this would by my choice in the
 
matter, but I think it is something that should be thouRbt shout.
 
U511, there yo" are, with one more thing to ponder over.  I hope I h
alve been
 
of some help.
 
Faithfully,

Sorry about this.  I am sure some other ideas will

funds are roing to be really t

Dear Lou,
 
I do wish you'd stop taking this Prant business as a personal refection of
 
you and your festival
..  Nobody is "denying` you zrvthInp.  There is .
a lirited
 
amount of ronev, and an incredibly large number of people and worthy causes
 
like yours vho feel they ought to get it.
 
It's true that we hardly ever fund the same festival
. beyond three years, because
 
there are so many others wafting their turn.  Y
'
£aybe that's not good policy, but
 
it's the polies+ we've got and the policy we've been using for the last ten
 
years, and all I can do is tell you what that policy is.  As far as traditional
 
performers go both the Folly
. Ethnic Program and oe Folk Arts Prograr
: ur#pee '
Foss
 
many times to use local traditional artists.  Zha
,t kind of protran"mire is top
 
priority for na.
 
I
'm enclosing yet another copy of our guidelines.  VIty not take
s them to the
 
granting officer at San Diego State and let Mr
. help you come in fer a small
 
grant for our October deadline that would fit the kinds of thi ns you do that
 
we can fund, not Just a general "festival eapensee lt
 kind of application?
 
You haven't apvlied in a lone while, and if you wA
,rst to apply for some special
 
p
thart of your festival, the panel s
*
iight be interested.  Please bear in mind,
 
ough, that the Endowment's budget is bei
.np, reduced and I don't expect large
 
requests to have much chance in these difficult times.  If you need further
 
help call s
aw, or Richarl Keeling, or Dan e
heehv, and we can give You advice
 
over the phone.  The number is ?
n?
./634-4zRz; call person-to-person collect
 
and your call will be returned on the federal line.
 
Finally, I
'm sorry but T can't write a letter of snprort for the festivn! as
 
long as I
'm a federal officer.  ;
fait until I retire in the next while, anti
 
I
'll be hapr+y to bombard the college for eou.

incerely,
