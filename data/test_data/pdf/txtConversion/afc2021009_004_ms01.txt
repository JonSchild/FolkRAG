CH 00:03
Good morning and thank you so much for agreeing to take part in this very important project with the
Library of Congress. Would you please state your complete name?
AA
Good morning. Thank you for having me. My name is Ashleigh Anderson.
CH
What city and state do you reside in?
AA
I'm from Detroit, Michigan.
CH
Okay, Motor City. What year were you born?
AA
I was born in 1996. I'm just shy of 26 years old [chuckles].
CH
Okay, a baby [laughs]. Okay, and you were born and raised where?
AA
So, I'm from Detroit and my family kinda moved a little bit farther west and came to Romulus,
Michigan, which is the hub where everyone pretty much flies in when they come to Detroit.
CH
Is that where the airport is?
AA
Yup, exactly where the airport is.
CH
Oh, okay. And is that where you live, in Romulus?
AA
Yep, I'm from Romulus. Yep.
CH
Okay. Alright, alright. What inspired you to become a nurse?
AA
When I think back to my initial interest, it really stemmed from going to daycare, actually. My mom and
my dad were very much so working people and they had us in daycare a lot when we were leaving
school and, you know, they still had to work afterwards. And I can recall, like, in my particular daycare
being, you know, maybe, like, 10 and having babies around me [chuckles] and the-- whatever caregiver
3
XXXXXXX
was in charge of the daycare at the time, they saw an interest for me that I, you know, had an interest in
taking care of babies at the time. So, when I think back to that, and just instances where I've been, like,
the older cousin and things of that nature, just having cousins that came after me and taking care of them
and having a desire to take care of them. That's kinda how I decided to have a passion in, like, maternal
and infant health. So, it kinda just took off from just being young and being around children, I guess.
CH
Okay, alright. Tell me about your education journey.
AA
Sure. So, fresh outta high school, 2014, I very much so wanted to go to Howard University. Life saw fit
that I do otherwise. So, basically, I ended up at Wayne State University on a full tuition scholarship. I
had basketball as a potential option to play my cards, but I kinda lost interest after a while with
basketball and I didn't keep up with grades in high school, so I ended up at Wayne State just because
academically they were paying for me to go to school. So, I spent maybe, like, the first two years of my
time at Wayne State pre-nursing, as a pre-nursing student, and just getting all my prerequisites out the
way. But as I started to matriculate to my junior year, I got denied into the nursing program at Wayne
State. So, that was really hard for me to see past because I had actually turned down other options in
terms of my college pursuits just because I was goin’ where the money was. So, to make a long story
short, I was getting denied to Wayne State for nursing. I don't think it was really because of the grades,
but in hindsight or, looking back, everything worked itself out. So, I pursued my public health degree at
Wayne State to graduate in four years, and I started researching more about second degree options. So,
as I finished my public health degree-- I graduated in May of 2018, and that August, I started at
University of Detroit Mercy for my nursing degree, my bachelor's in nursing. So, that was a 16-month
accelerated nursing program that I completed right before COVID, [inaudible 3:54], 2019. Little did I
know [chuckles], as of January when I first sat down for my nursing boards that I would be a new nurse
in COVID. So, [chuckles] that's how things accelerated for me with my nursing, you know, education.
CH
So, you really are a new novice nurse.
AA
Yes [laughs].
CH
Yes. So, this is, like, two years in for you?
AA
It’s been two years. Last week was my two-year anniversary of my job.
CH
Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations. We'll talk a little bit more about your nursing path, but
I'm interested to know if you have plans in furthering your education.
4
XXXXXXX
AA
Yes, absolutely. I knew even before I became a nursing student that I had desires to go on to graduate
education. I didn't know exactly what sector, being that maternal and infant health was interesting to me.
But as a new NICU nurse, I came into nursing as a NICU nurse--
CH
And what is NICU?
AA
NICU is neonatal intensive care.
CH
Okay, and you came into that right out of nursing school?
AA 04:59
I did! I got a fortunate opportunity of getting a residency for six months at University of Michigan, and
so I had desires-- I thought of becoming a neonatal nurse practitioner. That was my goal, my idea was
when I was in nursing school. After spending some time in the NICU, I was around so many sick babies
that I kinda just felt my heart gravitating towards work that catered to mothers to not only be happier
themselves, but have happier and healthier babies. So, with that said, I'm currently in school for my
midwifery degree.
CH
Wow!
AA
Yeah. So, I'm pursuing education to become a certified nurse midwife, and then, God willing, on the
DNP track to become a doctor.
CH
So, midwifery is a graduate level certificate program?
AA
Yeah.
CH
And how long is that course of study?
AA
So, it depends on how fast you're taking your classes. For me, personally, I'm taking the part-time route.
I am doing my DNP, which is Doctorate in Nursing Practice, so that adds on time, but for a generalized
certified nurse midwife degree, it's usually about two years if you're taking it full time, but you can do
three years if you choose as well.
CH
Okay, and have you decided what area you want to pursue as a nurse practitioner?
5
XXXXXXX
AA
So, the CNM is actually one of the options. So, when you graduate, there's the four different routes you
can take. There’s the nurse specialist, the nurse practitioner, the nurse midwife, or the nurse anesthetist.
So, technically a lot of people-- There's programs out here now too that encompass CNM with WHNP,
which is a Women's Health Nurse Practitioner, and so it took some knowledge and some research for me
as well because I was like, “What's the difference between a Women's Health Nurse Practitioner and a
nurse midwife?” What I've come to find is that midwifery kinda umbrellas Women's Health Nurse
Practitioner work but it allows, you know, that practitioner to also deliver babies. So, if you will, in a
way, I would be considered a Women's Health Nurse Practitioner.
CH
Okay, alright. So, that sounds like a really exciting career choice there. So, where do you currently
work?
AA
Sure. I'm at Michigan Medicine, and [inaudible 7:19] is closely affiliated with the University of
Michigan's hospitals. So, I'm at my children's hospital and I specifically work in the Brandon NICU,
which is the neonatal intensive care unit for infants up to one years old.
CH
Okay. You already mentioned that you were in a residency program. Can you tell us a little bit about a
residency program?
AA
Absolutely. It’s something I encourage a bunch of nursing students to pursue straight out of school
because it affords you the opportunity to really hone in on whatever skill set or unit of interest to you.
As a nursing student, we get our clinical time, right, when we're in nursing school, but once we're
actually outside of the classroom, there's skill sets that we still have to acquire and develop. And so,
what residency does is it, you know, gives the new nurse the opportunity to still have their hand held a
little bit longer [chuckles]. You go to school, you take your NCLEX, and then sometimes you're, like,
thrown to the wolves and you're expected to know things that honestly, in all reality, like, you acquire
those skill sets by learning from mistakes and experience. But as a resident, you get the opportunity to
not only be mentored and, like, precepted by other nurses that you'll work with independently in the
future, but it gives you that time to actually be one on one with them for an extended period of time, as
opposed to an orientation period of, like, two weeks, three weeks, a month. I was given that opportunity
to have six months of mentorship, if you will.
CH
So, you weren't, like, just thrown in the bathwater to swim, right?
AA
Right, and I'm very blessed. I'm very humble. I appreciate the opportunity ‘cause it allowed me to really,
like, get to know what that specialty requires you to do independently.
CH
And you're able to, like, breathe and...
6
XXXXXXX
AA
Yes.
CH
Not feel overwhelmed.
AA
The new nurse is just overwhelmed as is with just gettin’ the degree, getting the certification and the
license. That's enough as is, so starting a new job is adding even more stress. So, I am 100% a proponent
of seeking out residency as a new nurse, a new graduate nurse.
CH
I am so happy that in nursing now they have afforded the new nurse that opportunity, you know. We
know that physicians go through that internship and residency, and nurses in the stone age, which I came
out of, we were just thrown out there, you know. You had to learn how to swim if, you know, or, you
know, you could be drowning, you know. There may be some kind soul that would help to lift you out.
I'm kidding a little bit, but I feel that a residency program is great. They also have internships, is that
right?
AA
They kinda, like, are interchangeable I would say. I would say they’re kinda the same thing.
CH
Okay. So, when you think about nursing education, was there a large emphasis in this day of technology
on mastering technology as well as the didactics?
AA
I would say so for sure. Like, my program was prior to COVID, but I would imagine even more so now
with COVID, being as that virtual learning platform has been so heavily used, that technology is being
pushed. But when I reflect back on my experience two, three years ago, I've definitely felt like the tech
savvy part was embedded in the program. Are you referring to EMR charting and things of that nature
or…?
CH
Yes, the EMR charting primarily.
AA
I think that was something that, you know, we kinda acquired while we were in clinical, getting to know
some of the charting mechanisms and the systems that different hospitals use, for sure. Once you got to
clinical…
CH
To clinical, but it was not necessarily a part of the nursing education.
7
XXXXXXX
AA
Not necessarily. I think it is more so once you actually got that hospital experience that you got to see it.
More so in the classroom, I would say. When I think of technology, it was more so, you know, having
the means to have an online, like, virtual lecture or, you know, taking a test through, you know, a
computer program or something like that.
CH
But not necessarily for the practice of nursing.
AA
Not necessarily.
CH
The technical. So, mostly, you get that—
AA
In clinical.
CH
When you get into clinical, and certainly when you start to work. So, you already told me that you felt
like it was extremely beneficial to be in a residency program. There is a saying that nurses eat their
young. Do you feel that because you went through that residency, you weren't nibbled on that much?
AA
I definitely feel like I was a bit prepared. I do feel like I was more prepared than the average new nurse,
but I still agree with that statement that nurses eat their young. I've had experiences where I do feel that
way. Even being an African American nurse, I've felt that way in a unit where in 200 plus staff, there’s
only, like, five of us. So, I've had moments where I've definitely felt like nurses were eating their young,
but I do feel like I was more prepared than the average nurse.
CH
Do you have the desire to work in any other specialties besides the NICU?
AA
So, before I started out school, I had considered L & D for sure.
CH
And that is?
AA
Labor and Delivery, my apologies. For me, it's always been an interest in, like I said, women's health.
I've never really-- I remember going to clinical in nursing school and being on, like, hematology floor
and I was like, “What am I doing?” [chuckles]. There’s just like-- When you hit that one area that you
just-- it just resonates with you, you don't have any other interests, right. So, for me, I knew, like, going
out of nursing school into practice, I had those aspirations initially as to becoming a neonatal nurse
practitioner, which is why I sought out the NICU, but I always had in the back of my head that if I didn't
8
XXXXXXX
do NICU, I would have done Labor and Delivery, just for the simple fact that I would be around moms
and babies all the time.
CH
Your area really is women's health and babies, just going through that process of birthing and making
sure that baby and mom are well. I need to back up a little bit and ask you about your family dynamics.
AA 13:56
Sure. So, I'm the oldest of three [laughs]. I've always had that, like, motherly nature about myself. I've
been even told by my sister, like, sometimes just in, like, leisurely activities and stuff, I just have that,
like, nurturing, if you will, like, just dynamic about myself. But I'm the eldest of three. We're all three
years apart. I have a little sister and a little brother. My parents are still together. They've been married
for-- I'm 25. They’ve been married for 30 years. So, that's kind of our close knit family, a family of five.
I'm currently just a single black female, no kids, you know. My brother and sister are everything to me.
I'm actually looking into getting a dog in a couple, so I might be adding that to the family. But that's it,
just the five of us.
CH
It sounds exciting. Are your parents professionals as well?
AA
Yeah. So, actually, my mom is a paraprofessional for a tax agency called Thomson Reuters. It’s housed
in Ann Arbor, and she does a lot of auditing work there. My dad, when COVID hit, he decided he was
gonna retire early. So, he worked for 25 years as an auditor at the headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan
and he retired actually in-- When was that? June of 2021. So, he's been happily retired for almost a year
now.
CH
Do you feel that they have some influence on you pursuing higher education?
AA 15:27
Oh, absolutely. Not necessarily nursing. They didn’t question nursing, but higher education 100%. They
were really supportive of the idea of trying to go to college debt-free. I think that was something that
was ingrained in me even in high school by us, like, being raised-- We played basketball growing up,
and that was an avenue for us to pay for school. But both my parents have a bachelor's degree. My dad
has a master's degree. You know, just growing up, as I grew to understand how society works and things
of that nature, he always encouraged that, you know, education is something that can never be taken
away from you and there's power in that. So, yeah, it was never a question of if I was going. I was going
to college [laughs]. Like, that was a non-negotiable.
CH
So, you went to high school and you went on to college. That's great. How long have you been a
member of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated?
9
XXXXXXX
AA
So, I was initiated into Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated in November of 2019. So, I'm going on three
years old [laughs].
CH
Wonderful. What undergraduate chapter were you a part of?
AA
So, my undergraduate chapter was Lambda Chi Beta. It’s a part of University of Detroit Mercy. I served
as the Basileus, or president, of that chapter while I was there. Being that I only did a year program, I
was only there for a year and then I quickly transitioned to the graduate chapter, Lambda Chi of Detroit,
Michigan.
CH
You already told us the position you held on the undergraduate level. Any other positions you held as a
Beta?
AA
As a Beta, I was just president of the chapter. I did, however, get the opportunity to transition to what
our organization calls the Third Vice President. So, that's the office that is strictly given to Betas, if you
will, undergraduate nursing students of Chi Eta Phi, that pretty much oversees all the Betas in the
membership. So, it just focuses on retaining membership in the Beta population of the sorority, as well
as trying to push the agenda of not just graduating but, you know, thriving as a new nurse as well as, you
know, transitioning to graduate membership, which is something that was all happening at the same time
for me on a personal level.
CH
Do you feel that the programs that are offered to the Betas through the organization are instrumental in
helping you develop as a professional?
AA
Absolutely. Granted, I would like to see more, and we've been working on that more in terms of, like,
you know, just giving Betas more insight into the various routes there are in nursing. But in terms of
NCLEX preparation, which is extremely key in the process of becoming a nurse--
CH
What is NCLEX?
AA
Oh, excuse me. NCLEX is the standard test that every nursing student has to take to become a registered
nurse.
CH
So, there's the nursing board--
10
XXXXXXX
AA
The nursing board, right.
CH
The organization that facilitates you getting your licensure.
AA
Right, and that's across the board for any nursing student. So, what Chi Eta Phi has done is provide
opportunities on not just a national level but, like, locally through different chapters for, you know,
nursing students to seek out opportunities to learn more and to be more prepared for, you know, what's
coming ahead after graduation. Also, just in terms of scholarship funding, that's a huge piece of it too.
Chi Eta Phi is extremely instrumental in helping students, you know, get to the point where they can
attain, you know, their nursing degree.
CH
Through the scholarships that they offer. Do they also offer webinars?
AA
Yes.
CH
Or some other type of in service training?
AA
Yeah.
CH
For NCLEX.
AA
Yes. So, specifically speaking to my office, there is something we did last year actually that caters
specifically to that purpose, which was NCLEX preparation, but also just getting the understanding of,
like, what it takes to actually, you know, do good on a nursing interview and things of that nature. So,
we had, like, a seminar if you will, over the course of two days that was taking place just over Zoom. It
was like a Zoom conference, if you will, and we had this guest speaker that I personally looked up to all
of my nursing education that was-- we were able to, you know, have be our keynote speaker. She really
just gave a lot of insight into like the, you know, the untold, like, the things that are just assumed to be
understood as a new nurse. What we need to really garner and hone in on is that transition. There’s a key
transition that takes place from that mindset of being a nursing student to a graduate nurse. So, things of
that nature that really do help the nursing student come-- become from novice to, you know, actually
practicing.
CH
But you know they consider you a novice nurse from year one to 10 [laughs]?
11
XXXXXXX
AA
For sure, but in terms of being novice and also informed, there is a difference. I would say so.
CH
So, I guess you transition from being a graduate nurse to a novice?
AA
Novice nurse, yes.
CH
And it’s a transition in itself. Do you feel that the graduate chapter was very supportive to your Beta
chapter?
AA
Oh, absolutely.
CH
In what way?
AA 21:09
Without them, I feel like we would fall apart. So, the graduate chapter actually delegates who becomes
the graduate advisor for the undergraduate chapters. So, that for one is a key part, because that's how we
look to our graduate advisor. Then for two, it's as if we partner with them for programming as well. So,
anything that the graduate chapter deems, you know, eligible to happen or okay to happen, we, you
know, carry that out. But also, they ask us sometimes to partner. Then also with our particular graduate
chapter in Detroit, they actually are housing two other undergraduate chapters, so that affords us the
opportunity to partner with those undergraduate chapters for programs as well. So, it's all about
networking too, because at the end of the day, you know, if you're gonna stay in that area, you can, you
know, assimilate and just transfer over to the graduate chapter once you become a graduate member. But
in terms of just becoming a nursing professional, there are so many opportunities to network and get to
know the graduate members that, you never know, could simultaneously be helping with your nursing
career.
CH
I heard you speak about programs. What type of programs did the Beta chapter engage in?
AA
For sure. So, for my chapter and, like, I'm speaking for my chapter, when I was a nursing student, we
spent some time with shelters in Detroit. So, around Thanksgiving, we found ourselves at a homeless
shelter helping to pass out, you know, lunch bags, especially around Thanksgiving, because you know,
there's a lot of homeless people that aren't having that fancy meal. So, that was one thing we did. There's
another initiative we did that I took particular interest in because it was women's health related where we
went to a women's shelter. In the city of Detroit, they have one called the Alternatives for Girls. So,
basically, they housed women that may be raped or molested or trafficked, and that allowed us the
opportunity to come in and really just speak to them, give them, you know, a new face to have
conversations with. Again, we had the opportunity to cook for them as well. So, things of that nature,
12
XXXXXXX
really seeking out ways that a city that you actually live in or you serve or you spend time in needs help.
That was a couple of ways that our chapter engaged.
CH
So, that was keeping in step with the model of service for humanity. Did you all have any campus
involvement?
AA
For sure. So, when I was in undergrad-- That's crazy that I'd say that now. When I was in undergrad, we
had, you know, different fundraisers we would have on campus where, you know, we'd have snacks that
worked in the vending machines and students would love to, like, you know, seek us out to get them,
and that helped us to fundraise money to actually do things for our organization. But also, we had a
scholarship just for our campus. So, when we were fundraising and things of that nature, that was with
the mindset of also giving back to our nursing students that go to our school that weren't even in our
sorority. So, things of that nature, like scholarship opportunities, giving students the opportunity to have
nice snacks in the library, working closely with some of our professors. Some of our professors are a
part of Chi Eta Phi, so that allowed us to have that type of relationship on campus as well.
CH
Certainly then there was another opportunity for networking again, getting some inroads to different
areas of the profession. What challenges do you feel Beta members face?
AA 25:06
That's a good question. I think one thing that really I struggled with was this false perception that once
you graduate from nursing school, that everything was, like, ready to go. Like, you just, you know--
This goal. You've had this goal for so long to just graduate, right? Then you graduate and it's like a
whole ‘nother world is ahead of you. It's a whole ‘nother world. Not to say that I didn't know that as a
nursing student, but I think there's so much time is just ingrained in you of just, like, doing the standard
thing that you came to do that you forget, sometimes, like, well, if I choose a specialty, there is so much
more to know about that specialty once I graduate. Then also just the complexities of NCLEX. NCLEX
is such a-- I don't even know how to describe that test [laughs]. For me, I was fortunate to knock it out in
65 questions, but there's some people that it takes 275 questions to get it done. So, I can't forget to
mention that. That test alone is something that every nursing student fears. So, I think that's a challenge.
I really think that's a challenge, because a lot of our minds are just-- much of our energy is put towards
this test, and we get to a place where we're tunnel visioning so much that we forget what else we have to
try to, you know, try to juggle. So, that, and then just, you know, life after school, you know [laughs].
You spend time if you're fortunate enough not to get debt, but you know, you rack up debt sometimes to
go to school, and the challenges of just being in a [inaudible 26:55] once you actually land that job
[laughs]. So, Betas are juggling all these things. You're juggling trying to pass and become, you know,
registered. You're juggling trying to actually get this degree. You have to secure this job, and then you
just are trying to prove to society that, like, you know, your, you know, your worth which you've been
putting in so much work for, and then you can lose sight of, you know, just being, you know, taking in
the moment. Then that's another thing that I talked to a friend about the other day. It's just giving
yourself grace for, like, being able to have those milestones, because it's like, at one point, you weren't
[inaudible 27:29] graduate program. At one point, you weren't a nurse, you know. I can say that now. I
wasn't always a nurse. I didn't always have a Bachelor’s of Science in Nursing. I actually, in fact, got
13
XXXXXXX
denied to nursing school three times. So, when I have moments where I feel defeated, I have to give
myself grace, because it's a process. It really is.
CH
What does service for humanity mean to you?
AA
Oh, it means a couple of things. When I think of humanity, I think of just the essence of every human
being having needs, right. Those needs look different for every person, but having this mindset where
you're not just sympathetic but you're empathetic. That's something that I really try to keep in mind just
as a nurse period, is not just imagining what someone feels like, but actually putting yourself in their
shoes. When you have that mindset, you adopt this, like, this-- you just adopt this aura about yourself
where what you do has purpose. So, for me, service for humanity is just being purposeful in my
interactions and really just keeping people in mind and treating people how I would want to be treated.
So, that's what I think of service for humanity.
CH
It sounds great. We are experiencing a historical and challenging time in healthcare, our society and
nursing in the face of the pandemic, COVID-19. How has this impacted you and your professional
practice?
AA
A lot [laughs].
CH
And you did mention, “I'm just coming into this profession during a pandemic.”
AA
Oh my gosh. I can speak to this on so many different levels.
CH
Well, let's go.
AA 29:21
So, I graduated and became a nurse, like, I got my license and I started my job as a nurse in January of
2020. COVID actually hit February of 2020. It didn't blow up ‘til March, but I literally started working
as a nurse in COVID. So, even two years later when I reflect, it was challenging because I don’t even
recall going to the hospital without a mask on my face.
CH
Never worked without a mask.
AA
I don’t recall ever going to the hospital and seeing people's faces. That's a really crazy thing. So, that's
one thing that I will never, you know, like, I will never understand. Then for two, so I was telling
somebody this the other day. I work with women, right? So, there's been a lot of, you know, what is it?
14
XXXXXXX
How would I say this? Being that people spend so much time in the house lately, there's been a lot of
babies being born. I’ll be honest. So, that's hitting me from two angles, because it's like, not only am I,
like, it's just so many patients, right? We already are understaffed as a industry, but now it's just-- it's
exponentialized with COVID. Then my coworkers also [laughs]-- So, being that I'm this [inaudible
30:42] senior nurse and I'm just, you know, fresh off the, you know, block, I really have been
overworked. When I tell you overtime has been something that-- I burned out already and I'm only two
years in. It sounds-- I don't know how that sounds to the nurses been working for 25, 30 years, but I can
honestly say as two years in, I've felt burnout in a way that I probably shouldn't as a new nurse, because
of the simple fact that, like, the shortage is just what it is right now. When I think about just even
catching COVID myself, that's a whole ‘nother angle as well. It's just like how health systems have had
to kind of, like, work around how to staff, you know, these units when their employees, if they catch it
on the job, wherever, however they're catching it, how are we still safely staffing with what's going on.
So, just being someone that's caught it myself, it's kind of been challenging too to kind of navigate, you
know, how to use my time off. You know, in terms of just paying-- a paycheck, you know, like, how do
you do that when you're being told to now quarantine for five days now, right? But at that time, it was
like 10. It was two weeks and things of that nature, you know. If you're catching it on the job, something
like what I did, like, how do you navigate that? I was at work and I caught it and I was at work. So, it's
been very challenging on many fronts. I can even reflect on a special certification that I actually want to
acquire. It's called ECMO: Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation. It’s something-- It's a modality in
the NICU that essentially-- it works as a baby's lungs. So, there essentially-- There’s some cool stuff that
University of Michigan does. But essentially, I want to get that certification, and that has been
something that has been on hold for me and I haven't been able to attain because COVID has stunted so
many different programs and things that, you know, were normally operating prior to this pandemic. So,
COVID has done a number in a number of ways. It just will be interesting to see what the foreseeable
future will look like. But, I think one thing COVID has done is really put in perspective for people what
really matters and what's important in life, because we've had a moment to kind of slow down and really
see what, you know, what do we have when all the other things are stripped away?
CH
Have you seen many babies come in with COVID?
AA
So, that's not really the case. Usually what happens is if a baby has COVID it’s because, for example, a
mom has had a C-section and she had COVID herself and the baby caught it in the C-section. The babies
usually are not the ones that are the COVID, you know, carriers. If I have a baby with COVID, it's been
very rare. Then also, nine times out of 10 is the baby's only on contact precautions or COVID
precautions because the mom had it. So, basically, we're doing these rule-out testings to see if the baby
has it, being precautious because the mother has it. It's never really been because of the baby has had it,
and even if the baby has had it, there's been so few situations where the baby has had it that I haven't
been exposed to it [inaudible 34:04].
CH
Did your facility have a problem with the personal protective equipment?
15
XXXXXXX
AA
I do recall masks being short. There was a shortage of masks probably about a year and a half ago, but I
can personally say that that lasted maybe, like, two weeks and we were told, like, to hold on to masks for
a little bit. But I personally can say that I've not-- I haven't witnessed having any shortage of PPE.
There's been a shortage of other things.
CH
Such as?
AA
So, in the NICU, we have something called, like, lavage systems, which is where, you know, we-- when
babies can't feed off of a bottle, they use a tube. There has been instances where the syringes to those
tubes-- Like, we have different like-- 30 ml syringes we have 60 ml syringes. Some of the syringe sizes
are not-- have not been available. We have had instances where some of the lines that I hang for their IV
supplementation, some of the, like, NADs or the links that we put onto those lines, we've had shortages
of those. So, those are examples of things that have been interestingly short on the unit, but when it
comes to PPE, I've not been in a situation where I felt like, “Okay, this is unsafe because I don't have the
proper--" Fortunately. I don't know how that is for every other health system, but…
CH
So, that interruption in the supply chain is translating into more than just a shortage of PPE, a shortage
of the other equipment that you need to effectively carry out your job. How about social distancing on
your unit?
AA 35:56
So, that is something else that has been challenging. So, we have what's called-- We don't have bays in
my unit, we have alcoves. So, our alcoves are pretty much because all of our babies actually have
single-patient rooms. So, in these alcoves, we have two people that can sit on it at one time. I do
remember in the brunt of COVID, we were told we had to space out because of obviously not knowing
what COVID entailed. But when you asked how social distancing has been, I really almost want to say
“the lack thereof,” because it's gotten to a point now where, and I hate to say it, pretty much every
employee has caught it at some point. I'm just gonna be honest. So, now that we have this new normalcy
of, like, people have caught it, people are not really-- We all are wearing masks 24/7. Like, masks are
not leaving our faces, but when it comes to social distancing at work, that's not really a thing. When I go
to the lunchroom, yes, there is, like, a level of social distancing that takes place that's different from
when I'm on the floor, but people have started to get more comfortable with congregating in the lunch
rooms. I will take note of that, is that when I look at last year compared to this year, there's more
comfortability around that, whereas back last year, I remember them opening up rooms that were not
used for, you know, lunches and breaks and stuff because people were so, you know, just finicky about--
even down to like huddle in the morning when we would have to report. We would all used to be in the
room together. I remember there was a point in time where they would literally tell us we could call into
huddle. So, now it's not really that, because people are starting to have not comfortability around
COVID, but once people have caught it and they're back to work and things are normalized, if you will,
quote unquote, people aren't as on edge as they were when we didn't really understand what COVID
entailed.
16
XXXXXXX
CH
So, in the huddle, is it just you and the person or persons you're reporting to, or do they give, like, a
general overview of what's going on with every patient?
AA
It's a general overview of what's going on with every patient. So, for me specifically on my unit, we
have 200 plus nurses because of how many different shifts we have. We have, like, a 58 -bed unit. But,
like, on average, huddle is about 30 nurses. So, we're all in one room with management talking about
our game plan for the next 12 hours, the next eight hours, and people are picking assignments. So, things
of that nature.
CH
You pick your own assignment?
AA
I thought that was interesting too. Yeah, in my particular unit--
CH
You pick your own.
AA
Yes, yes.
CH
It’s not--
AA
It's not assigned to you. There's pros and cons to that. But I was really surprised by that, ‘cause just
being, you know, a nurse tech for so many years, a nursing student for so many years, I was used to
coming into work and charge nurse told you what you had to do. But at my particular unit, they have
adopted this philosophy where you can kind of just pick, and people have, you know, people have
preferences that they had the baby the day before or--
CH
For continuity.
AA
Yeah, for continuity of care. Of course, that takes precedence. But, like, for the most part, people just
say, “Hey, I want this. Hey, I want this,” and people respect it. So, that culture has been something that
I've enjoyed.
CH
After you have the huddle, do you then have a one-on-one report?
17
XXXXXXX
AA
Absolutely. Yes, yeah, yep. So, we congregate all together for the shift, and then right after we all get a
game plan of, like, who's taking what assignment, what ratio, we go to the person that's coming off shift
and we have our one-to-one report to hand off for the day.
CH
And what is the nurse-patient ratio of your NICU?
AA
Okay, so for my NICU, it’s a level four, which means it's, like, the highest acuity there is in terms of,
like, the patients we serve. So, I on average will never take care of more than two babies. If I'm taking
care of three babies, they're literally just there to grow and [inaudible 40:04], so it's kind of like a nanny
mode. But nine times out of 10, I'm taking care of two babies, and every blue moon, I'm taking care of
one baby that just needs that much attention.
CH
Yes. When you said level four, I was like, well, what is that? [both laugh] Because intensive care, I
know there's no way you’re taking care of four patients. Maybe on a step-down, but--
AA
No. On a regular day, I'm taking care of two babies all the time.
CH
We are experiencing racial unrest in our society and inequity in health care, and the racial unrest is
across the board. You see it in education. We see it in the professions. Certainly we’re seeing it in
politics. Can you share any insights and experiences that you have faced in any of these platforms?
AA 41:10
For sure. Two came to mind when you asked the question. I've had a patient experience and I've had,
like, a working employee experience. So, with the patient experience-- Granted, like, my patient
population is babies, so when I say patient it’s nine times out of 10 referencing the parent [laughs]. So, I
actually had an experience where I, as an African American nurse, was pretty much taken off the care
team because a parent did not want me serving their child. I can say from just the interactions, I do feel
like it was racially motivated, because I know the care that I provided for that patient. So, that was hard
to, you know, just come to terms with, ‘cause it was, for me, based off of the fact that my skin color was
what it was.
CH
And management allowed that to go?
AA
I don’t believe management allowed it to go, but you think about these patient-centered approaches that
these hospitals are adopting, right? So, what management did was they just kind of played it from the
angle of a one-on-one conversation with me, “We don't support this, but for the sake of pleasing our
patient, we're going to allow another nurse to take care of this patient.” So, that was one particular
instance that I had that really just rubs me the wrong way.
18
XXXXXXX
CH
How does it make you feel towards your management that they approached the situation in that way?
AA
Yeah. Granted, like, at the end of day, I don't really want to be in a situation where I'm taking care of or
I'm around people that don't want me around. So, I will say that. Let me just preface with that. I don't
want to-- I'd rather be in an environment that serves me as well, right? But it was definitely a valid point
that I wanted to make to them was: How is this that we are essentially supporting their desires that are
racially motivated, right? They completely understood my viewpoint. I think the conversation really just
took a turn of, unfortunately, what are patient-centered approaches being-- what patient-centered care is
being handled here? Because really, when you think about it, these health systems are so economically
motivated that really, at the end of the day, we're trying to get these patient scores up and we're trying to
do all these things that are gonna promote funding and things of that nature. So, on the bigger picture,
that's really what the conversation took a turn of. I kind of left it at, okay, well, this is somebody that I
won’t take care of. We have 57 other beds. But it is disappointing that, like, that's kind of what our
environment has kind of adopted as a normalcy.
CH
Did this occur in the beginning of the shift, in the middle of the shift, towards the end?
AA
I mean, honestly, when I think back on it, it was-- I remember it happening in the middle of a shift. So, I
finished out a shift, and then it was like a passive aggressive approach, right. So, it wasn't even like I
was aware of the fact that the patient didn't want me taking care of their child while I was taking care of
your child. I found this out probably the next day or a couple of days later, after I had completely taken
care of the child for a day. I come back to work another day and, you know, it's just told to me before I
even go out to the floor: “This is a patient that, you know, we're gonna have someone else take care of.”
So, it's kind of, like I said, that passive aggressive thing where the mom had this agenda but I wasn't
aware of it and I, you know, I did my job and I find out after the fact.
CH
So, maybe that kind of helped to put a little buffer for you that it didn't happen while you were actually
taking care of the baby.
AA
Sure. But I can also say too, in the same light, I've been in situations where I've served African
American families and they want me to take care of their child. So, it goes in both hands and that's been
really gratifying. Like, parents have said, “I really want her taking care of my child ‘cause she looks like
me and she understands where I'm coming from and she does a great job at what she does.” So, I take it
with a grain of salt in some ways. Like, granted it’s not-- it doesn't feel good. I've been raised to be, you
know, the minority a lot of times and so it's not like I've never seen these things happen before, but…
CH
What does it mean, “I've been raised to be the minority”?
19
XXXXXXX
AA
Oh wow [laughs]. It means that when I walk into a room with people that don't look like me, I'm not
taken aback by it and it's normal for me. When I'm in a room with a bunch of people that look like me, I
am relieved, I'm happy, because it's not normal for me.
CH
Okay, so being in Chi Eta Phi when you see us all together…
AA
I love being in Chi Eta Phi.
CH
Yes, because we are a predominantly African American organization. And the other example that you
had?
AA 46:32
Oh, yes, yes, yes. So, I was in a situation where I had a charge nurse that has some, like-- she just has a--
it’s known that she's not the nicest person to work with. Being the newer nurse on the block, you know,
you're getting to know personalities. So, to make a long story short, there was a particular shift where I
felt very micromanaged by her. It was very weird, because it was, like, it was almost out of her scope of
what she needed to be doing that day. So, you're the charge nurse. You know, of course, you are, you
know, managing what everyone, you know-- you're seeing what all your nurses have going on and
you're making accommodations for admissions and, you know, discharges and all the things, right? But
this particular day, I felt like she was just very-- had this agenda of seeing what I was doing. I have
already been known on the unit as someone that's younger, someone that is clearly a minority. So, I
actually made a-- [inaudible 47:40]. We’re a union hospital. So, that was an instance where I got the
union representative involved because I felt like I was being profiled that day. I felt like I was being
racially profiled. I felt like I was having a distraction at work, because it was no reason for her to
constantly come around a 58-bed unit. She kept coming around, kept coming around to see what I was
doing and making comments about things that kind of were almost, like, just racially motivated, almost.
I can't really reflect on exactly what happened, but what I can remember is that the comments she was
making to me throughout that shift-- It was, like, a 12-hour shift. They were just very minute. Like, why
are you focusing on that? So, what I did was I ended up reaching out to management about it, telling
them I felt very uncomfortable that day because honestly, there's a power dynamic there. You can assign
me certain types of assignments if you wanted to and make my day more complicated if you wanted to.
So, it essentially ended in a problem-solving meeting where it was very uncomfortable ‘cause I called it.
I called it. Mind you, she's my superior, if you will, because she was the charge nurse that day. She kind
of negated everything that I said, but I wanted it to be known for that to be something that happened and
I'm so fresh and so new to a culture, a unit environment, a unit culture, that that's not okay for me. That's
not okay. I'm a firm believer in you set the precedent for how people treat you. People treat you how you
allow them to. Since then, have I had any problems with her? No [chuckles]. So, but, like, that's an
example of me feeling racially profiled. I felt like my job was not done in a full capacity because I had a
outside force that was kind of, like, impacting my work that day.
CH
Do you all have a EEOC department?
20
XXXXXXX
AA
Is that like a diversity, inclusion?
CH
That’s Equal Employment Opportunity.
AA
Yeah, yeah.
CH
Where you can go and file a claim if--
AA
If you seek it out. So, for me, it was more of one of those things where I was learning that, like-- That
happened early on in my new job as well. So, it was for me even seeking out having a union
representative in a problem-solving meeting, that was something that was new to me. So, I found out
about, like, EEOC after that. So, I didn't feel the need to escalate to that because it was nipped in the bud
from the problem-solving meeting but best believe, for me having to initiate a problem-solving meeting,
I didn't feel like I should have had to do that so soon, but it happened.
CH
You should do it whenever you feel that your rights as a professional nurse and as a human being are
being violated, and not to be afraid, because you are a professional. I'm sure you have a very high
standard of practice that should be respected. Again, just the mere fact that you are a professional
registered nurse working with another supposedly professional registered nurse, we should be able to
respect each other.
AA
That's right. Like, we talked about, like, things that, you know, nursing students, like, need to know and,
like, those are the untold things. They are the unsung things that you kind of have to learn by experience.
It's not gonna be a blueprint to this. Things are gonna happen that you're not prepared for necessarily.
CH
Perhaps that should be a part of the Betas’ toolbox.
AA
I would agree.
CH
That these situations you may face and how do you handle that. I'm glad you were in a union facility
where you were able to get that situation taken care of. Do you have any ideas on solutions to bring
racial gaps together in the profession?
AA 51:55
In the profession as a whole, I feel like I'm a part of an organization for that purpose. When I think about
others that are not a part of the organization, I wouldn't say I have a solution, but what I can say is that
21
XXXXXXX
every individual should adopt the mindset where they look to see how they can be an advocate in that
regard. So, whether that looks like, you know, you heading up some type of, you know, minority group
or reaching out to a Chief, you know, Officer over diversity inclusion because of an instance that
happened, I think that people really need to take it upon themselves to really seek out-- make it an
agenda, make it something that's actually a priority. You'd be surprised that when people all do that
collectively, what change could happen. So, it really starts with the individual. Like I said, sometimes in
these big organizations, like, that's not common, so it really takes a grit and, like, a level of just
endearment about yourself to try to just fight the fight to make it a priority.
CH
And bring that awareness to the forefront. In your community, in the facility where you work, do you
have the occasion to see inequities in healthcare?
AA
Would you equate that to, like, patients as well?
CH
Mmhmm.
AA
So then, absolutely. There was a particular instance where-- We actually talked about it recently in a
meeting, where there was a father of a child, and I’ll try to be careful with my words, who was a
minority. You know, we have securities that-- we have security officers at hospitals for obvious reasons,
but I felt his concern with his child was valid. He got upset. He got upset, and it was not just in an
audible way, but he started, like, being very expressive with his emotions. Like I said, as the nurse who
knew exactly what he was upset about, I don't fault him for how he felt about the situation. He wasn't
having an altercation with anybody. He just was very expressive with how he felt, more so than maybe
somebody else would have been. I feel like he was rightful to do so the way he did because in some
ways, what was happening to his child I feel like was a result of his resources. He didn't have resources.
So, what happened was security was called and a scene was made, because security's around this person
that is essentially upset for a valid reason. They escorted him out of the room. This was a situation
where this particular father of the baby-- The mother was not involved. Very interesting situation. When
you just think about that in totality, like, the bigger picture, this baby is just being born and it's already a
situation where, you know, his advocates are not at his bedside. So, that's just one example.
CH
What is your vision for the future of nursing? I know you are just coming into nursing, but do you have
a vision for what the future of nursing will look like?
AA 55:22
It sounds cliché, but I think it just needs to be more respect, the same respect that you give a doctor, a
prescribing physician, which also nurses can do. If they go on to get graduate education, they’re
prescribing providers as well. I don't think people realize that. There's this conversation around, like--
CH
[Inaudible 55:42]
22
XXXXXXX
AA
Yes! Granted, like, you're not going to call your nurse a doctor, but the essence of a doctor is someone
that has attained this terminal degree in a specialization. We use “doctor” interchangeably with
“physician” a lot, which is fine.
CH
They're calling nurse practitioners “doctors”.
AA
They're getting more comfortable with it. All that to say is, nurses are the ones who are literally-- and it
sounds cliché, but it's not being respected enough. We are literally there for the grit. We're there for the
things that the doctors don't see. We're there when the doctors are not even there. Not to slight doctors.
Doctors are necessary, doctors are necessary. Physicians are necessary. We need them. But when you
look at who's in the room and who's actually doing the work, like, the dirty work, it's the nurses. I think,
you know, you can give as much Nurses Appreciation Days as you want. You can give as much
discounts as you want. But when you look at the bigger picture, nurses are very underappreciated. I'm
not just talking about their pay. I'm talking about the respect they get on an organizational level. I'm
talking about the accolades that they're given. It's very not equal to other health professionals.
CH
For someone thinking about becoming a nurse, what words of wisdom would you give them?
AA
I would say, first, what is it that interests you? Why are you thinking about it? Once you have that and
you know that, keep that same exact agenda, because you're gonna have various instances where you're
gonna try to attain that goal and you're gonna wonder why in the first place. So, before you even go seek
it out, what is your why? Why is it that you want to do this so bad? Remember that, because there's
gonna be instances where you're going to wonder if this is, you know, is this something I still want to do.
But if you really-- Like for me, it was really, like, I genuinely want a career where I feel like I have
purpose, where I can come home some days and-- There's some times I've come home and I've been able
to read a card that was put in my mailbox from a family because they appreciated what I did. Things of
that nature, like, that's why I do it, because I just want to be there for someone in their time of need.
That, if nothing else, makes me feel like I have a purpose of what I do in my life.
CH
I have a purpose. Absolutely. Do you feel that Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated makes a difference in
service for humanity?
AA
Absolutely! I wouldn't be a part of it if I didn't! I just think that it gives this platform that’s unknown to
us. Not us, but it's very uncommon. This platform is not just a Greek organization. This platform is not
just a professional nursing organization. It is a dynamic that allows me to not only feel like I can be
around people that look like me but people that are doing it with excellence. Honestly, there's so many
instances in my career, and I'm young in my career, but it's, like, that is not an opportunity for me. The
people that are doing things with excellence and people that look like me are not often-- they're not often
in the same room. Does that make sense? So, when I think about that in our mission of service for
23
XXXXXXX
humanity, it promotes this agenda and this initiative to others that makes them look and see people of
minorities in a different light, and that trust factor is there. It also allows other organizations with
different agendas to have more respect for minorities. It allows those other organizations to partner with
us and for us to come together and be a force together. So, I think Chi Eta Phi is an exemplary way of
service for humanity, because we are taking these backgrounds that we have and this professional career
that we've been able to attain and we're promoting a agenda that honestly is needed right now in a
climate that is-- you know, our social climate is just so-- it's so upset right now, and organizations like
Chi Eta Phi are necessary.
CH
So, would that be your final thought on our beloved Chi Eta Phi?
AA
Oh, no! That's not my final thought. I can also say Chi Coo! But I will say I just-- I really, if nothing
else, I want to just say how dear Chi Eta Phi is to me, how I respect the founders and their vision, and I
want nothing more than to be a vehicle to just propel it.
CH
That's part of our project to develop nurse leaders, and I applaud you on that. I thank you so much,
Ashley, queen, for being a part of this project. Because of your contribution, people will understand,
throughout history, who Chi Eta Phi is and how important what we do is for society as a whole and our
profession.
AA
Thank you for having me! I'm humbled to be here.
CH
You're so welcome. You're so precious. Again, I thank you so much.
AA
Thank you.
