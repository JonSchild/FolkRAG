TTTI1 CHARMING YOUNG WIDOW 
I MET ON THE TRAIN. 
Whilst in New-Jersey, a 
lidtar was sent to me 
From Boston, which bid me quickly repair 
To an uncle ; it stated : fast he was dying, 
The wish had expressed to make me his heir. 
So, hurriedly packing a 
f_tw things together, 
-Wishing that Boston quickly might gain, 
By a 
first-class express went; in the same carriagis, 
A charming young widow I met on the train. 
An infant she had, so fondly caressing; 
I 
ventured to ask, if that was her own ? 
She answered in words appearing distressing— 
Yes; and its Papa is dead and gone I 
When the question I 
asked, in my face looking— 
That look I 
shall ne'er be forgetting again ! 
In fact, fast my heart to herself was hooking, 
Was the charming young widow I met on the train, 
As the train it was stopping, the engine to water, 
She asked in a 
hurry—Would I 
be so kind 
Her infant to take it, the darling so quiet ? 
Of course, I 
replied, I 
don't mind. 
To the refreshment room she went into 
The signal for starting I 
heard but in vain, 
Not a 
glimpse could I 
see of her; the train without started 
The charming young widow I 
met on tho train. 
Loud I 
wag shouting, the train to be stopping, 
Out of the window putting my head; 
• 
No answer receiving, the infant I 
took it, 
Discovered, 0 
horror! it was dead! 
On its bosom was sewn a 
note—which on reading, 
• Found I 
was taken in, done for, quite plain— 
It begged me bury the child for the sake of 
The charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
It was strange to myself that I 
was remarking 
how quiet a 
child, not hearing a sound— 
The sweet little creature asleep was, she told me; 
Quite dead asleep—so, in truth I 
foand. 
I 
took it, ancl, buried the poor little creature, 
Its age or its name I 
could not explain; 
On a 
stone was inscribed—Underneath was bequeathed Tne 
By a 
charming young widow I 
met on the train.

THE LANCASHIRE LASS 
The way that I 
won her is strange you will say, 
'Twas one afternoon that I 
went to Bellevue, 
A 
young friend of mine was there for the day, 
And took little Polly for whom he'd to pay; 
When first we met I 
soon could see, 
That with his chance 'twas all U. P. 
. And so I 
asked her if she'd have me, 
This beautiful Lancashire Lass. 
My Lancashire Lass, &a. 
She said " she'd be mine" and she swore to be true 
We've since been like doves, billing and cooing! 
We never fall out as some lovers do, 
And she has some money, betwixt me and you; 
She bought this watch which now I 
wear, 
If she don't mind, well I 
don't care, 
She says " that her fortune I 
shall share," 
My beautiful Lancashire Lass. 
My Lancashire Lass, (
te. 
She's published the banns, were going to be wed. 
I 
leave those matters for her to settle, 
To-morrow, for time so quickly has fled, 
The Lancashire Lass to the church will be led; 
I 
need not work whilst there's a 
purse, 
To the idea I'm not averse, 
And p'rhaps one day I 
may have to nurse, 
A sweet little Lancashire Lass.

K M. Dg Wirr, 13 Frankfort Street. 
Price five cents.1 
If you list to what I 
say, 
will show you the way, 
To be healthy, wealthy and wise; 
It's all nonsense and wrong, 
When men say they can't get on, 
A man can never thrive till be tries. 
I 
have heard some people say, 
They never had a 
lucky day, 
But they have let that day go by:. 
If you put off till to-morrow 
You'll find then to your sorrow, 
That you've left it too late to try. 
CHORUS. 
Then on, boys, on, the course is always clear, 
And never stay to give way to sorrow; 
Tho' everything to-day may look so dark and droar, 
Yet brighter days may come again to-morrow. 
Why should WO sigh or fret 
If good times have not come yet, 
Our strutrgle may not have been in vain; 
Though all seems overcast, 
The sun will shine at last ; 
Without a 
turning, very long's the lane. 
So never waste the day. 
Tor Time and tide for no man stay, 
And never think of troubles that are gone; 
Be both happy and content, 
Let your time be all well Tent, 
And be up with the lark in the morn. 
Then on, boys, on, &o. 
If your time lins been misspent 
There is time yet to repent, 
Why your days in vain regretting spend 7 
But pull hard in your boat, 
And, like a 
ragged coat, 
It may never be too late to mend. 
Should on yon smile fortune. 
Then give to the poor a 
portion, 
And up life's ladder lend a 
helping hand; 
Owe to ione you cannot pay, 
Just think of a 
rainy day. 
And never envy any in the land. 
Then on, boys, on, dtc.

SHE DANCED LIKE A FAIRY. 
I'll relate to you, public, the source Of my woes: 
They're worse than hard blows, for, nobody knows, 
When. -with love your young heart like a 
cauliflower grows, 
And the girl don't care two-pence for you. 
The case it is mine, I'm sorry to say, 
Through a 
girl. when I 
think, my heart heaves, 
Whom I 
taught to dance in an exquisite way, 
And sing twice as well as Sims Reeves. 
CHORUS. 
She danced like a 
fairy, and sang like a 
bird, 
She did, on my word ; but, rather absurd, 
• 
She doated on Charley-, 
a man that you've heard, 
And so she skedaddled from me. 
Then, her father sold goods on a 
second hand plan, 
He'd, when he began, no meat in the pan, 
But, from little to big, he became a 
great man, 
And he, now, has a 
hard-me-down shop. 
Coats, trousers and waistcoats, for him she would turn, 
And convert the old shirts into new, 
When business was done, then her step she would learn, 
And dance in a 
suit of light blue. [She danced, fik0 
The first time that I 
met her, 'twas at her Pa's shop; 
outside did stop, then inside did pop, 
Half-a-sovereign bright in her little palm drop, 
Said: Have you got a 
suit to fit me ? 
She showed an assortment, hats, coats, boots as well, 
And, at last, I 
chose these like a 
man ; 
She said I 
looked handsome, in love with me fell, 
From that time Jur courtship began. 
[She darned, R.:e 
On each Saturday-night, I my clothes would redeem, 
It's just like a dream, so strange does it seem, 
. Just to think we, on Sundays, looked. like King and Queen, 
When from" Uncle's" I'd borrowed my clothes. 
He'd lend me my chesterfield, just for the day, 
And, on Mondays, P.t take him them back, 
The money spent on her, but to my dismay, 
One morning she gave me the sack. 
[
She danced, &c. 
But sweet Charley, got clothes from the same shop as me, 
And, soon, I 
could see, with me 'twas U P. 
He made friends with her father, and with them took tea, 
And he sang them his last comic songs. 
ills soft winning ways her affections did win, 
.A.ticl then he took her feelings by storm, 
lie then brought her out, and he thus took me in, 
For with him she now does perform. [Site danced, 4te.

My missis she calls me Sairah, 
But father for short calls me " Sal;"

LOVE AMONG THE ROSES. 
SONG 4ND DANCE. 
Words by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
MUSIC by E. N. CATLIN. 
It was on one Summer's evening, 
In the merry month of June; 
I 
beheld a 
damsel sitting 
'Mid flowers' sweet perfume. 
She had a 
novel, reading, 
Just as I 
was passing by, 
And as she turned another page, 
I 
saw the brightest eye ; 
A 
bewitching smile was on her face. 
As charming as the posies: 
I 
felt the smart of Cupid's dart: 
'Twas love among the roses. 
CTIORtiS.—Now, I 
hate to tell, but then I 
must; 
Within her heart I 
place my trust; 
She was sitting in the garden, 
Where the little butterfly reposes: 
And how we met, I'll ne'er forget, 
'Twas love among the roses. 
I 
passed her house next evening, 
The clock had just struck eight, 
And I 
saw my future happiness; 
She was standing by the garden-gate. 
She smiled as I 
approached her, 
And I 
begged her to excuse; 
May I 
view those pretty flowers ? 
She murmured: If you choose. 
I 
spoke about the violets, 
Then finally made proposes; 
Thro' the garden we walked, of happiness talked; 
'Twas love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, &c. 
I 
confess I 
love Matilda; 
Matilda, that's her name; 
And there is a 
charm about her, 
Which I 
never can explain. 
She dresses up to fashimi, 
To her style there is no end, 
And, of course, she must look dashing; 
For, she wears a 
Grecian Bend. 
But she's left her home, and where she's gone, 
Most every one supposes; 
For, as dear as life is my little wife: 
'Twas love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, &c. 
is 
19 
THE GRECIAN BEND. 
Kind friends I 
am here to sing to you a 
ditty, 
And if you will but to me your ear lend. 
I'll speak about the fashions in the city, 
The last of which is called The Grecian Bend; 
The ladies are the persons who have got it, 
And lately it seems to be all the rage, 
They bend over, for that seems to be the great hits 
But to me it looks as if it were old age. 
CIIORIJS. 
Oh, my, what a 
style, 
flow foolishly the money they do spend, 
I'll bet my alt I 
never will get married 
As long as the women have the Grecian Bend. 
The other day I 
thought of getting married 
To a 
darling little creature over the way; 
One afternoon at her door I 
tarried, 
To the key-hole I 
chanced to put my eye; 
Her wax nose she laid near the shutter, 
Her false teeth she was trying to mend, 
She'd a 
glass eye, but that I 
did'nt care for, 
But I 
left her when I 
saw the Grecian Bend. 
Oh, my, what a 
style, &e. 
When shall our stylish folks get common reason, 
I 
really think the leaders must be mad, 
For waterfalls and long trails were a 
blessing 
To this which is the worst that could be had: 
they'd only introduce it in the army, 
What a 
comfort to the soldiers they would send. 
For they could carry crackers there when it was stormy. 
Oh, I 
wish that old Nick had the Grecian Bend. 
Oh, my, what a 
style, tke.

Music by W. I'. WELtat.4 tigo 
Up and down the gay Broadway I 
go, 
Quite disting,ne in my dress and air; 
All the ladies lrok at me I 
know. 
I'm got up with the greatest care I 
All the tailors like me for a 
sign, 
Everything about me is the style; 
Nothing coarse, of course, is in my line, 
A shining light from boots to " tile!" 
SPOKEN.—Yaas !

But they haven't got the style I've got,

Dainty ringlets falling on my brow, 
Lots of friends and lots of cash to spare, 
I'm good for all except a

As for smoking, hairen't got the nerve; 
My cane it weally tires me so !

PRETTY LITTLE FLORA, 
[The music of this piece, arranged for the voice and the pianoforte, 
is published hi De Witt's Sixpenny Series of Choice 2/usic. 
For sale by 
It. M. De Witt, 13 Frankfort Street. 
Price six cents.] 
I'll sing of pretty little Flora, the gem behind the bar, 
At a 
place near Harlem, you will find my guiding star, 
She is the sweetest treasure, all around near and far, 
And to speak the truth, I 
adore her ! 
Swells flock like little flies around a 
treacle pot, 
And want to steal my fair one, but I 
don't care a 
jot, 
They talk and drink, just to look large, and fancy they'r A 1, 
But they have not half a 
chance with little Flora. 
CHORUS. 
Laze/rig to the music up in Central Park, 
All among the crowd I 
met her; 
Flora was her name, my heart is in a 
flame, 
And I 
never, never, never can forget her 
How I 
love little Flora, and for hours I 
would stand, 
The proudest of the proud, and the grandest of the grand, 
And soon I'll place the gold ring upon her tiny band, 
Yet I 
keep my eye on all who stand before her; 
When swells they pass a 
joke, she says, 
Sir, don't be rude,' 
And putting on a 
frown, declares they very much intrude, 
Then, turning round, she looks at me, as much as just to say, 
Oh I 
George, you have the heart of little Flora I 
Lisening to the music, &c. 
I 
could eat pretty Flora my love is so sincere, 
She wants no Bloom of Youth, her skin it is so fair, 
Her eyes are full of fire, she's a 
splendid head of hair, 
And in a 
brooch she carries me before her; 
We've named the happy day, so I'm right for life, 
If all is true as she says, she'll prove a 
charming wife, 
So am I 
not a 
lucky man, my rivals to defeat, 
And marry my own charming little Flora ? 
Lisening to the music, &o.

I

can reach him 
The fact I 
mean to teach him, 
Though he may have a 
dozen wives 
Still I 
am Number One. 
0 my Popsy Wopsy, &c. 
Now ladies, take a 
warning, 
Let my fate be a 
warning, 
The men are all a 
sort of kind 
Of Bluebeard and not true, 
But if they will neglect us, 
To love they can't expect us, 
For what is sauce for goose you know, 
Is Sauce for gander too.

THE 
21 
GIRL OF THE PERIOD.—[CoNeumEn.1 
We pride ourselves on fine chignon, 
And charming style of hat; 
Which those strange men may smile upon, 
But we, don't care much for that : 
We make "la mode" our study, 
Are first in fapion's field; 
And, 'spite the men, we'll so remain, 
And sooner die than yield. 
A 
Girl of the Period, &c. 
Our style attracts attention as '111644A" 
We promenade the Park; 
Men tremble when they meet us 
At Soirees after dark: 
We handle well the ribbons, 
When out upon a 
drive, 
And if you come to horsemanship, 
The odds are twelve to five— On us, of rourse. 
A 
Girl of the Period, &a. 
When out upon the river, we 
Can show one how to row, 
Pace, forty strokes a 
minute,—now 
That's not so very slow I 
And when we do some billiards, 
We never play at " pot," 
But " go in" for pretty cannons, or 
Score thirty off the spot. 
A 
Girl of the Period, &c. 
15. Let spiteful writers paint us black, 
And old maids have their say ;— 
The " Girl of the Period" 's 
no worse 
Than the " Young Man of the Day 
There may be faults to find with us, 
But- the young men are to blame ;— 
Dress as we will, we know that still 
'They'll love us just the same.

Girl of the Period, &c.

ZERLENA. 
On yonder rock reclining; 
That fierce and swarthy form behold 
Fast his hands his carbine hold, 
'Tis his best friend of old ! 
This way-,,1,4s steps inclining, 
his scarlet t.Titine waves o'er his brow, 
And his velvet cloak bancs low, 
Playing in careless flow. 
Tremble !—E'en while the storm is beating, 
Afar hear echo repeating, 
Diavolo! Diavolo! Diavalo 
ZERLINA. 
Although, his foes waylaying,' 
He fights with rage and hate combined, 
Tow'rds the gentle fair they find, 
He's ever mild and kind. 
The maid too heedless straying, 
(For one, we Pietro's daughter know,) 
liorne returns full sad and slow: 
What can have made her so 
Tremble !— Each one the maiden meeting, 
is sure to be repeating— 
Diavolo ! Diavolo I 
Diavolol 
MARQUIS 
While thus his deeds accusing, 
Let justice, too, at least be shown,— 
A 
ll that's lost here, let us own, 
Mayn't be his prize alone. 
Full oft his name abu-ing, 
Perchance some young and rustic beau, 
Whilst his hopes wiih conquest glow, 
At beauty's shrine bows 
TreniLle !—Each sighing laver dread, 
For of him more truly may be said--
Diavolo I 
Havolo 
Diavolo I 
TRE eTlii6Y'S WARNING. 
Trust him not, 0 
Gentle Lady, 
Though his voice be law and sweet, 
Heed not him who kneels before thee, 
Softly pleading at thy feet. 
Now thy life is in its morning: 
Cloud not this thy happy lot. 
Listen to the Gipsy's warning, 
Gentle Lady, trust him not. 
Lady, once there lived a 
maiden, 
Young and pure, and like thee fair: 
Yet, be wooed, he wooed, and own her, 
Thrilled her gentle heart with care. 
Then he heeded not her weeping, 
He cared not her life to save! 
Soon she perished—now she's sleeping 
In the cold and silent gravel 
Lady, turn not from me so coldly; 
For, I 
have only told the truth, 
From a 
stern and withering sorrow, 
Lady I 
would shield thy youth. 
I 
would shield thee from all danger, 
Shield thee from the Tempter's snare; 
Lady, shun the dark-eyed stranger, 
I 
have warned tle;e—now beware. 
Take your gold, I 
io not want it, 
Lady, I 
have prayed for this, 
For the hour that I 
might foil him, 
And rob him of expected bliss. 
Aye, I 
see thou art filled with wonder 
At my look so fierce and wild, 
Lady in the church-yard yonder, 
Sleeps the Gipsy'4 only child. 
NORAH O'NEAL. 
Bong and Chorus written and composed by W ILL. S. ILITIU. 
Oh 1 
rm lonely to-night, love, without you, 
And I 
sigh for one glance of your eye; 
For, sure there's a 
charm love, about you, 
Whenever I 
know you are nigh. 
Like the beam of the star when 'tis smiling, 
Is the glance which your eye can't conceal, 
And your voice is so sweet and beguiling, 
That I 
love you, sweet Norah O'Neal. 
CHORUS. 
Oh 1 
don't think that ever I'll doubt you, 
My love I 
will never conceal; 
Oh I'm lonely to-night, love, without you, 
My darling, sweet Norah O'Neal I 
Oh I 
the nightingale sings in the wild-wood, 
As if every note that he knew 
Was learned from your sweet voice in childhood, 
To remind me, sweet Norah, of you „ 
But I 
think, love, so often about you, 
And you don't know how happy I 
feel, 
"%it I'm lonely to-night, love, without you, 
My darling sweet Norah O'Neal 1 
Oh 1 
don't think that ever, 
Oh! why should I 
weep tears of sorrow P 
Or why to let hope lose its place ? 
Wont I 
meet you, my darling, to-morrow, 
And smile on your beautiful face? 
Will you meet me? Oh say, will von meet rak. 
With a 
kiss at the foot of the lane ? 
And I'll promise whenever you greet me, 
That I'll never be lonely again. 
Oh! don't think that ever, &c,

J1TLIANA-PFIEBIANA-CONSTANTINA BROWN. 
Oh I 
I'm going to sing a 
song to you about Juliana- Brown, 
She was the prettiest yalier gal was ever in the town ; 
lihe had eyes so bright and teeth 80 white, like diamonds they did shine, 
And such a 
lovely foot dho had: she wore a 
number nine 1 
CHORUS: 
For, she looted so sweet, and she dressed so neat: 
Of all the pretty yaller gals was ever seen in the town, ' 
It's my Juliana Phebiana-Constantina Brown. 
Ohl the first time that I 
saw her, she was dressed up to the teeth, 
The look teat she then gave me nearly took away my breath. 
I 
asked her if she would only be true to me, 
And, when I'd sell my Foodle-Dog, a 
married we should be. 
For, she looked, &c. 
It's my Juliana-Phebiana-Constantina Brown: 
She was the prettiest dancer, for miles and miles around 
For, when she went to balls, her like was never seen: 
For, she was sure to be the Belle, and I 
the Belgerine 
For, she looked, & a. 
CONE IN AND SHUT THE DOOR. 
0, do not stand so long outside, 
Why need you be so shy ? 
The people's ears are open, John, 
As they are passing by 1 
You cannot tell what they may think; 
They've said strange things before. 
And if you wish to talk awhile, 
Come in and shut the door. 
CHORUS . 
Come in, come in, come in, come in, 
Come in, come in, come in and shut the door. 
Nay, do not say: " No, thank you, Jane," 
With such a 
bashful smile. 
You said when ladies whispered, No 
They meant— Yes I 
all the while. 
Ny father, too, will welcome you, 
I 
told you so before; 
It don't took well to stand out hero. 
Come in and shut the door. 
Come in, come in, come in, cto. 
You say I 
did not answer you 
To what you said, last night---
I 
heard your question in the dark, 
Thought on it in the light---
And now iny lips shall utter 
What my 'heart has said before  
Yes, dearest. I ...... but, wait a 
while, 
Come in and shut the door. 
Come in, come in, come in, ctc.;

LONDON SOCIETY.—[CONCLUDED.) 
Society has fancy fairs, for charity, of course; 
To them one has to go—the proper thing, you know; 
There Mrs. Smith, the brewer's wife, -who rides the mighty 
With countesses and duchesses will show: 
[horse, 
They ask you from their stalls, you cannot make excuse, 
You join a 
lottery and p'rhaps you win— 
Though five pounds for a 
doll, that's not the slightest use, 
Should cover quite a 
multitude of sins 1 
Cuonus.—Baden Baden, &e. 
Society, as soon as e'er the London season's o'er, 
Will to the sea run down, where, in a 
bathing-gown, 
It dabbles in the water, or perhaps upon the shore; 
It yawns and wishes it were back in town. 
Assembly balls are slow; and, though it may be nice 
To drink the nasty waters at the Spa, 
And meet the sort of men you'd cut at any price, 
The London season I 
prefer by far. 
CHORUS.-Baden Baden, drte. 
Society reads magazines; as through the list I 
range, 
My eye cloth quickly rest on one, and I 
invest; 
It's called " London Society,"—by Jove 1 
how very strange 
The title of my song should be the best; 
Its poetry is good, its pictures you should see, 
Its fund of information is a 
host— 
Henceforth I 
take it in, and once a 
month 'twill be 
Upon my table with my " Morning Post." 
CHORUS.-Baden Baden, i&c. 
Society I've met with in the Highlands, 'mid the fogs, 
In Paris, ever gay, and in New York's Broadway, 
In Mont St. Bernard's Convent, with the monks and jolly dogs— 
At every place, I 
think that I 
may say. 
But there's a 
charm in town, I 
can't help saying so, 
That makes me like it more than all the rest; 
And, with a 
private box, a 
ball, and Rotten Row, 
Society in London is the best. 
ClIORUS.-Baden Baden, ctc.

My little blue butterfly, rest awhile, 
Here where the garden blooms! 
The beautiful roses, how sweet they smile, 
With rich and rare perfumes ! 
Come, rest you here in clover, 
Why must you onward hie? 
Each bud you kiss, you rover, 
And then away you fly I 
CTIORUS„ 
Ah I—its just the same with love ; yes, 
We'll find it out at last 
Some flower will charm of gayest dress.— 
All vows away we cast 
For evermore Love a 
rover will be, 
From heart to heart he'll flee, 
A 
little butterfly so gay, 
That's roving from you to me! 
So, little blue butterfly, gay and free, 
Never a 
word you say; 
But wooing and winning you sail in glee, 
Through all the summer day! 
The rose and pink are smiling, 
Come, linger by their side; 
The lillies fair beguiling, 
Their lips won't be denied ! 
Ali !—it's just the same, tte.

WE PARTED BY THE RIVER-SIDE. 
We parted by the river-side; 
The moon looked down on you and me, 
The stars put on a 
look of pride, 
'he river murmured to the sea: 
The dew-drops kissed the blushing rose, 
The gentle winds did sigh; 
One word broke nature's sweet repose, 
The sad word was: Good-bye 
CHORUS. 
Oh tell me that you love me yet, 
For, oh! the parting gives me pain, 
Say, tell me that you'll not forget, 
For, we may never meet again I 
We parted by the river-side: 
A 
tear-drop trembled on your cheek, 
In vain to tell my love I 
tried, 
My heart was sad, I 
could not speak. 
I 
promised that I 
would be true 
So long as I 
would live; 
The parting kiss I 
gave to you, 
Was all I 
had to give. 
Ohl tell ra 5 &C. 
We 
parted by the river-side: 
And I 
have roamed a 
distant clime, 
My heart has not forgot its pride; 
For, I 
have loved you all the time. 
And I 
am faithful to you still, 
While I 
believe you true; 
Afar or near, let come what will, 
love you, you, only you.

MUS .0 
by G. 
OPERTI. 
My cognomen is racketty Jack, a 
noisy swell am I, 
I 
care not how the world may wag, I 
never will say " die." 
In grog and beer I 
do indulge, sometimes in Cliquot true; 
A 
bottle of phiz is all my eye, bring in a 
dozen or two! 
CHORUS. 
Hi! Ho! Hi ! Stop! here Waiter, Phiz! Pop! 
I'm racketty Jack, and no money I 
lack, and I'm 
the boy for a 
spree. 
I'm racketty Jack, and no money I 
lack, and I'm 
the boy for a 
spree! spree ! 
When I 
go out at night, my boys, I'm always ripe for fun, 
And 'mongst the fair I 
do declare, I 
always was A 
one. 
Tho' a 
harum scarum sort of a 
chap, I 
never forget the gals, 
And. next to them there's nothing on earth like phiz and 
jolly pals. 
Hi! Ho! Hi, &e. 
I 
like a 
lark, I 
do of course, I 
can't help being gay, 
I 
follow in the governor's steps, so at least the people say; 
For beauty I 
admire and for a 
spree I'm always fresh, 
You see what's bred in the bone, my friends, is sure to come 
out in the flesh. 
Hi! Ho I 
Hi, &c. 
I 
never bonnet a 
Bobby, no, nor cheat a 
Cabby's fare, 
Nor, like low swells wrench knockers off, and kick stalls in 
the air, 
For I 
can true enjoyment find with friends like you at my 
back, 
So fill up your glasses once again and. drink with racketty 
Jack. 
Hi! Ho ! Hi, &c. 
To the girls we love then let us drink wherever they may 
be, 
And let the toast go round Hurrah! with a 
jolly three 
times three; 
The ladies all God bless them, so join me in the cry, 
For they are jolly good fellows, which no one will deny.

SHE WAS JUST ABOUT. THE AGE.-(CONCLUDED) 
She lived a 
little way from town, it wasn't very far, 
And with her dwelt a 
cross old man although be was her 
One day when her papa was out I 
went to her's to dine, 
And in my pocket for a 
treat, I 
took a 
quart of wine. 
For she liked wine, she would you know, she would you know, she 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she was just about the age. 
Fa; 
We sat and talked a 
little while, and after we had dined, 
I 
for a 
little drop of wine felt mightily inclined, 
When a 
rat- tat we heard at the door, and she to me did rush, 
And pushed me in the cupboard, and twas then I 
saw her blushN 
But then, of course, she would you know, she would you know, she 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she was lust about the age. 
Her father then came in, and talked flir half an hour or more, 
And she sat leaning all the while against the cupboard door, 
When the wine-
flask in my pocket broke and made a 
precious mess, 
Ran underneath the cupboard door, all tound her new silk dress. 
For she wore silk, 
he -would you know, she would you know, she 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she was just about the age. 
Her father saw the flowing wine, and said. Sarah, what is that!' 
She said. " Some jam and pickle jars are broken by the cat ," 
Ile opened then the cupboard door, exclaiming, " Who are you 
And I 
was in a 
pickle, in a 
jam, and in a 
stew. 
The old man swcre he would you know, he would you know, he 
would, 
But then, of course, he would you know, he was just about the age. 
lie pulled me out and punched my head, then with good humor he, 
On hearing I 
was not bad off, invited me to tea ; 
Since then I've married Sarah Green, and pleased I 
am to see, 
That she and all our little ones quite happy seem to be. 
But then, of course, she would you know, she would you know, sbe 
would, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she was just about the age.

It's well to be in love with One, 
But if there should be Two, 
Both begging for your heart and hand, 
What can a 
poor girl do ? 
I've One who always bothers so, 
No matter where I 
be, 
And whenever he sees a 
chance, 
Why, then he says to me— 
CHORUS. 
" 
Susan, Susan, pity my confusion 
Won't you, won't you, won't y 
on marry me ? 
Susan, Susan, if you still refuse on(e), 
T 
shall, I 
shall, I 
shall D I 
E 
As soon as Number Two has gone, 
Then in comes Number One; 
" 
My own dear girl," says he to me, 
Oh! tell me what I've done, 
That to my suit you will say ' No,' 
It's cruel, upon my word: 
Dear Sue, now do say you'll have me, 
And give up that man absurd.' 
Susan, Susan, &c. 
Of course, I 
cannot wed them both, 
But, between you and Sue, 
I 
don't care much for either one, 
So, I'll give up the two; 
And somewhere else I'll find a 
beau, 
Who'll have some other way 
Of winning little Susan's heart, 
Than saying all the day--
Susan, Susan, ctc.

THE GLORIOUS VINTAGE OF CHAMPAGNE. 
Words by EDMUND FALcomta. 
Music by M. W. BALM, 
When fortune frowns and friends forsake, 
And faith in love is dead ; 
When man has nothilig left to stake, 
To hope, nor yet to dread, 
One god-like pleasure doth remain, 
Worth all the joys he's lost— 
The glorious vintage of champagne, 
To drink at some knave's cost. 
CHORUS. 
Let life's last song have for refrain, 
The glorious vintage of champagne. ' 
When one by one fade all the beams, 
That light morning's path, 
So dull the world around us seems, 
At life itself we're wrAth. 
New vigour then would we regain, 
Let's drink at some knave's cost, 
The glorious vintage of champagne, 
Worth all the joys we've lost.

Alit when the season's in full swing, 
Now that's the time for me, 
Such " howling" swells and dashing belles, 
You every night will see; 
Fond Inas and pas so anxious, 
In glory they come out, 
And lay such traps, for us poor -chaps, 
At party, ball, or rout. 
Spoken—Yes, by Jove! you should see the old ladies how they 
pile up the agony. 
Lady Fitzfright will observe to her charming 
daughter—" Arabella., darling, do you observe that elegant young 
fellow with the light moustache, he is the younger son of a 
baro-
net," " Indeed, mamma, where have you seen lihni" 
Why in— 
Belgravia, Belgravia, die. 
Wander where you will, my boys, 
No matter where you go, 
You'll never see, Pm certain, 
Another Rotten Row; 
For where can you see such beauty, 
As you will meet with there, 
On a 
stepping horse, I'm there, of course, 
Among the fairest of the fair. 
Spoken—By Jupiter! that 
the place for beauty. " Hallo, Char 
Icy, old fellow, who's that lovely filly I 
saw you with in the ride 
yesterday I" " Oh, she, my boy is an heiress." " The devil!" " No 
'men cher ami,) she's an angel and comes from— 
Belgravia, Belgravia, & c. 
So now, dear boys, I 
must be off, 
I've something on to-night, 
There's Lady Freezeum's party, 
And her I 
cannot slight; 
She's guardian to a 
charmer, 
Who has some thou's a 
year, 
And to cut a 
dash, one must have cash, 
To live near Belgrave Square. 
Spoken—Belgravia is like Billingsgate, one can't get on without 
the coin, so when I 
get settled in my new estate I 
shall be happy 
to invite you all to dine in—

WHEN SATINY COMES HOME. 
Words and Music by G. W. 
I 
love a 
valiant soldier bold, 
neteen years old, with plenty of gold 
On his dress, and if the truth he's told 
lie's awful fond of me. 
The one that I 
love his name is Sam, - 
Such a 
darling is Sam, without any cram; 
/ 
like him far better than raspberry jam, 
For his like yet I 
never did see. 
CHORUS. 
0 sha'n't I 
be glad when Sammy comes home, 
When Sammy comes home, when Sammy comes home, 
Oh sha'n't I 
be glad when Sammy comes home, 
When Sammy comes home in the morning. 
He wears a 
red coat and a 
sword by his side, 
With spurs on his heels and long whiskers beside, 
And sometimes has a 
big horse for to ride, 
0 
don't he look martial and grand. 
On the top of his hat a 
feather there grows, 
Put there I 
suplese to show how the wind blows, 
His hair is Magen.a. and so is his nose; 
With the handsomest form in the land. 
0, sha'n't I 
be glad, &c. 
My Sammy has travelled to many a 
shore, 
Where the elephants fly and the crocodiles rear, 
And, oh, should he never come back any more, 
For my Sammy l'd die in despair. 
No one could imagine what he has gone tbre, 
He can talk foreign languages until all is blue; 
French, Dutch, Spanish, Persian, and Irish, too, 
To hear him would make you all stare, 
0 
sha'n't I 
be glad, &c. 
I 
shall never forget when he told me his love, 
And vowed by ; 41 the stars above, 
And squeezed my poor fingers as well as my glove, 
I 
believed every word that he said, 
But, oh, when he said that abroad he must hie, 
And wished me good-bye, I 
thought I 
should die, 
So I 
sat myself down and had a 
good cry. 
For without him I'd surely be dead. 
Oh, sha'n't I 
be glad, &c,

LOOK AT THE CLOCK 
Am.—" Groves of Blarney." 
Young ladies tarry, think ere you marry, 
A 
lesson pray take from what I 
sing, 
For though black slaves are, of course unknown here, 
We wives, you 11 find are the slaves of the ring. 
Our husbands nightly very impolitely, 
With their companion° abroad will roam, 
Of us neer thinking, they go off drinking, 
While we are crying our eyes out at home. 
CHORUS. 
Think, think, how slowly the moments pass, 
While you're enjoying your pipe and glass, 
Think, think, how slowly the moments pass, 
Now, gentlemen, pray mind what I 
say and look, look at 
the clock. 
Now, thus to leave us and so deceive us, 
l'm sure you'll own a 
monstrous sin, 
For there's no knowing where you are going, 
Or what bad company you may get in, 
For when you tell us, deceitful fellows, 
That at your club you have passed the night, 
At that saloon oh, you are often seen oh, 
You must acknowledge that is not right. 
Think, think, & c. 
Then when returning., we're soon discerning 
That in your manner there's something queer, 
You whisper" salmon," but that's all gammon, 
It's something stronger than that I 
fear. 
It must be really, for when awaking, 
A 
noise you are making for a " cup of tea," 
You didn't ought to waz.t soda water, 
Through eating salmon you must agree. 
Think, think, &c. 
The cradle rocking or mending stocking, 
The time we strive hard to pass away, 
While you are flirting, your healih, too, hurting, 
By staying out till the break of day, 
Besides suspicions will sometimes enter our heads 
While sitting up waiting alone, 
About your latch keys, for who's to know pray, 
-Whose doors they open beside your own.

My love was gone away.

Rose up to show me his place.

Methought he said, " In this far land, 
Oh, is it thus we meet !

Price five cents.] 
Oh, once I was happy and fat, 
But now r am wretched and lean; 
The cause of which is a 
nice young girl, 
As pretty as ever was seen; 
She said she loved me true, 
And truly I 
loved her too; 
But, alas that's past—for I 
found that lao 
Turned out a 
regular do. 
CHORUS. 
, 
She was such a 
nice young 
And just seventeen years old, 
But she's thrown me off for a 
fellow 
With plenty of California gold. 
She'd had a 
sweet-heart, it was said, 
But long she'd thought him dead; 
Thought I 
to myself, " Oh, won't itbe the* 
If she'll take me in his stead." 
So I 
took her to this and to that.

took her to every show, 
Till the fair feminine said she'd be mine, 
In the course of a 
week or two.

CALIFORNIA GOLD: 
The time was fast drawing near, 
When a 
strange tale I 
did hear: 
Her tirst young man had turndd up from abroad; 
oh! I 
felt most uncommonly queer 
I 
first felt hot and then cold, 
When the truth to me was told 
That this fellow'd come home in a couple of ships-
Full of California gold 
She was such, (
Cie. 
"Yes, in Cali—for—ni—a, 
A 
considerable distance away, 
This party found gold in lumps and clump 
(You've heard of the stuff, I 
dare say) 
It turned out a 
wonderful sort, 
And a 
nice little fortune it brought; 
So my love deserted me for this fellow, 
And thus of my heart made sport. 
She was such, 
I 
wish he'd been ate by a 
shark, 
I 
wish he'd been chawed by a 
pylcr, 
For taking my love away from me 
Without asking me whether I'd like. 
I 
find I'm considerably sold 
By this damsel so fickle and bold, 
So I'll end my pain at the end of a 
chain, 
Made of Ctlifornia gold. 
She was such, &A.

tell your wife. 
2 I 
never did a thing that's wong, 
No never once in fun, 
And always go home straight, and tell 
_My wife what I 
have done. 
'Twas rather hard, I 
met 
My cousin Jenny Fife, 
And just shook hands, to hear a 
cry, 
" 
Sad man ! I'll tell your wife." 
3 The other night an aged Aunt, 
Dropp'd in to tea with us, 
And when she left, as it was wet, 
I

But the Conductor rudely said,

I'LL TELL YOUR WIFE.—(CONCLUDED) 
Last week my little wife and I 
Went for a 
country walk, 
And when we reached a 
pleasant nook, 
We sat down for a talk. 
My arms around, her waist, I 
spoke 
About our wedded life. 
I 
turned and saw a 
gaping crowd, 
Who yelled—" I'll tell your wife !" 
I'll tell your wife, &a. 
I 
hear it in the noisy street, 
And in the quiet square, 
I 
hear its murmur in the shell, 
In short ' tis everywhere. 
That dreadful cry is killing me, 
It's causing fearful strife. 
What, Mr. Jenkins, did you say ? 
He says, " I'll tell your wife." 
II tell your wife, &a. 
HARD TIWES COME AGAIN NO MORE. 
Let us pause in life's pleasure and count its many tears 
While we all sup sorrow with the poor ; 
There's a 
song that wiil linger for ever in our ears— 
" Oh Hard Times come again no more." 
CHORUS. 
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary; 
" 
Hard Times, Hard Times come again, no more; 
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door, 
Oh, Hard Times come again no more." 
While we seek mirth and music, and music light and gay, 
There are frail forms fainting at the door ; 
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say, 
" Oh, Hard Times come again no more." 
'Tis the song, etc. 
There's a 
pale, drooping maiden, who toils her life away, 
With a worn heart whose better days are o'er ; 
Though her voice would be merry, '
tis sighing all the day-• 
" Oh, Hard Times come again no more."

BARBE BLEUE. 
Air—" In a 
Cottage Near a 'Wood." 
In my cottage, near a 
wood, 
Lived two dAnsels, young and good— 
In a 
cottage, quite close by, 
Lived a 
man who was mighty high, 
his 7 
lame was Blue Beard, so they say. 
It- turning home one very fine day, 
He met a 
damsel young and good, 
In a 
cottage near a 
wood. 
Air—" Bill Jenkins." 
Now Blut, Beard had six wive.; in his day, , 
And they al disappeared in a 
curious way, 
Ile wanted ano her—on them he did pitch, 
It was one of the sisters—he did not dare which, 
With his cooing and wooing, 
Lying and sighing, 
The young one consented 
To be Mrs. Blue Beard. 
Air—" Paddy's We ! ding." 
Blythe and gay they spent the day, 
When friends were all invited, Oh 1 
The honeymoon soon passed away, 
And the happy pair united, oh. 
But, fatal, as it came to pass, 
Blue Beard he to the wars did go; 
Like knights of old— for silver and gold 
He buckled on belt and sabre, oh. 
Air—" Siubad the Sailor." 
Then he called to his wife, 
And he said, on your life, 
Now, mind what I 
tell you— do dear; 
I'll give you the keys, you can go where you please, 
Only, not to the chamber that's blue, dear, 
Don't go the ch imber that's blue, dear, 
r11 cut off your head if you do, dear; 
Then, mounting his steed, he set off at full speed, 
Saying, " Don't go to the chamber that's blue, dear." 
••• 
BAB,BE BLETTE.—[CONTINITED1 
Air—" Bobbing Around." 
,When Blue Beard's wife went looking around, 
Around, around, around, around, 
The many wi n 
lers that she saw, 
When she went looking around. 
And when she hlot;ed in every room, 
Looking around, around, around, 
To the fatal chamber at last she came, 
As she went looking around. 
Air—" The Maniac." 
She turned the lock—she dropped th- key, 
Oh ! what is that on the wall I 
see ? 
I 
see tlam 'fringing on the wall— 
I 
see them hanging on the wall ! 
Oh I 
rele se 
release me! 
Or the sight of it— the sight will drive me mad. 
Air—" Oh, Susannah." 
She picked up the key, and hopped down stairs 
As light as any cat, 
And though her name was Fatima, 
She was not over fat, 
And when she reached the bottom, 
Quite thunderstiuck she stood— 
She rubbed 
I 
aro. scrubbed the key, 
But could not move the blood. 
Oh, Mrs Blue Beard lives is fear and dread, 
To unfold a 
tale of misery, perhaps; 
She might lose her head. 
Air—" Who's dat Knocking at the Door." 
When Blue Beard came back, 
And the keys to him were brought 
! 
be pulled a 
long face when he saw ono short, 
Where's the key of the chamber? 
Oh isn't it there? I 
shall be found out, 
Oh ! laws! 
Oh ! dear 1 
'Who's been unlocking of the door, 
-Yes, you've been unlocking of the door. 
Oh! it's no use to cry, these tears are all my eye, 
For you've been unl:icking of the door. 
BARBE BLEITE.—{coNcLuDED.3 
Air—" The Tempest of the Heart." 
Oh husband, pray do hear me, 
Wrong I 
was to go there—wrong I 
was to go. 
But you'll forgive me—yes, you'll forgive me, 
But Blue Beard answered " No !" 
Dry those tears—those tears unavailing flow, 
Dry those tears and propv,re to die. 
Oh! my husband, do not kill me— 
Oh my husband do not kill me, 
If you do, why you will rue, 
For ' twill surely break my heart. 
Air—" Mary Ann." 
Do look around my dear sister Ann. 
Do look around for awhile ; 
For my brothers are corning, 
Do give them the summons. 
For I 
am doomed to die, sister Ann— 
Yes, I 
am do ) med to die, sister Ann. 
Air—" Yes, Think of 3Ie:" 
Yes, I 
am doomed to die— 
Yes, I 
am doomed to die, 
Why did I 
go to the fatal room? 
' 
Through disobedience I 
must die. 
Air—" Polly, "Won't You Try Me." 
Just at the time the brothers came in—Ri tol, &c. 
Thy took old Blue Beard by the chin—Ri tol, &c. 
Then to ik their sister, Blue Beard's wife—Ri tol, &c. 
They took their swords and took his life—Ri tol, &p. 
Air—" Red, White and Blue." 
Now ladies with true devotion, 
Love your husban Is and mind What I 
say, 
Like a 
barque on the briny ocean, 
Your time will ride happily away, 
And never disobey your husbands, 
But always to them prove true; 
If the tie you should try to sever, 
'Why you're sure to be found out if you do.

I CANNOT CALL HER MOTHER. 
The marriage rite is over; 
And though I 
turn aside, 
To keep the guests from seeing 
The tears I 
could not hide, 
I 
wreathed my face in smiling, 
And led my little brother, 
To greet my father's chosen; 
But I 
could not call her Mother! 
She is a 
fair young creature, 
With meek and gentle air; 
'With blue eyes soft and loving, 
And silken sunny hair, 
I 
know my father gives her, 
The love be bore another; 
But if she were an angel, 
I 
could not call her Mother! 
To night I 
beard her singing, 
A song I 
used to love, 
When its sweet notes were uttered, 
By her who sings above: 
It pained my heart to hear it, 
And my tears I 
could not smother, 
For every word was hallowed, 
By the dear voice of my Mother. 
My father, in the sunshine 
Of liappy days to come, 
May half forget the shadow, 
That darkened our old home, 
His heart no more is lonely ; 
But me, and little brother, 
Must still be orphan children— 
God can give us but one Mother!

THE STANDARD BEARER. 
Upon the.tented field a 
Minstrel Knight, 
Beside his standard lonely watch Was keeping, 
And thus, amid the stillness of the night, 
He strikes his lute, while all around is sleeping— 
CHORUS . 
The lady of my love— I 
will not name, 
Although I 
wear her colors as a 
token, 
For I 
would fight for liberty and fame, 
Beneath the flag where first our vows were spoken. 
The night is past, the conflict's come with dawn, 
The Minstrel Knight has seen its fortifying ; 
'Midst death and carnage onward still are borne— 
IIis song is heard ' midst thousands around him dying 
The lady of my love, &c. 
Stern Death now sated quits the gory plain ; 
The life blood from the Warrior Bard is streaming, 
While on his flag he rests his hand with pain, 
And faintly sings— his eyes with fervor ikatning. 
The lady of my love I 
will not name ; 
I'll still retain her colors as a 
token ; 
I've fought and fell for lib, rty and fame, 
And never have our knightly vows been broken.
