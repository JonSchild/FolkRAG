are banjo, mandolin and guitar.
 
My f

Therefore, one o

How do most o

 Do  another  two-chord
 
song by ear (
'Cle mentine?') and t
each
 
parts  t
o  another  song.  Encourage
 
somebody t
o t
ake a

o
ther t

t

while people are catching up t

Also someti me a

 point
 
out with considerable enthusias m t
hat
 
t
he group has r
eached an important
 
milestone  with  t
heir  mastering  t
he
 
t
hird chord (
sub-dominant).  They can
 
now make a respectable s

Generally  by  t
he  f

he group will be ready
 
t
o l
earn a
 new key. I
 j
ust point out t
hat
 
i
t
's a good i
dea t

so you can s
ing i

f

 skip t
he
 
t
heory a
t t

 bring i
n a
 waltz
 
rhythm now, and we l
earn f
irst "Down
 
I

n t
he key o
f C, i
ntro-
ducing only one n

we t

a

t r
egularly AND i

This should be done early, as I have

and  by  t

I keep on  .
.ng t
hese same l
ines,
 
i
ntroducing a new chord or so each
 
week and l
ots o
f new songs. With each
 
key I
 t
each a f
ew runs;  usually i
n A
 
we have a walking bass pattern which
 
sounds real professional and can be
 
used by half t
he group while t
he rest
 
chord.  Within  twelve weeks or so,
 
even a
fter t
his s
low s
tart, most groups
 
have l
earned t
heir major chords and
 
-

are well i
nto t
he minors. By t
he t
ime
 
t
he c
lass has l
earned a
ll t
he s
tandard
 
f
irst position chords, we have a
 party,
 
i
nvite a couple o
f l
ocal f
olk s
ingers
 
and s
tart developing an i
nterest i
n new
 
s
tyles and approaches.  (Or sometimes
 
we i
nvite my husband t
o f
iddle, make
 
up a dance band out o
f half t
he c
lass
 
while  t
he  r
est  o
f  t
he  c
lass  does
 
squares, t
urn and t
urn about.)  With
 
occasional s
timulation o
f t
his k
ind, a
 
group can keep going f
or a l
ong t
ime;
 
I have had a c
lass l
ast as l
ong as a
 
year-and-a-half;
 and  many  people
 
have  switched back and f
orth f
or a
 
period  o
f  two  and  t
hree  years.
 
Mostly by t
hen t
hey are j
ust getting a
 
bang out o
f t
he s
inging, but o
ften t
hey
 
have decided t
o t
ry another i
nstrum-
ent and are s
tarting back i
n another
 
beginner group.  (Most groups, I
 f
ind,
 
e
ither  are f
riends t
o begin with or
 
make f
riends as t
hey go a
long, so t
hey
 
j
ust p
lain l
ike t
o keep on getting t
o-
gether as a social t
hing.)
 
This brings me t
o a d
iscussion o
f
 
t
eaching several i
nstruments a
t once.
 
The main reason f
or t
eaching t
his way
 
i
s t
he d
ifficulty o
f rounding up a re-
spectable number o
f banjo or mandolin
 
p
layers a
t t
he same t
ime. Besides, i
t
 
see ms t
o be s
timulating t
o everybody
 
concerned t
o have t
he d
ifferent voices
 
o
f t
he i
nstruments going t
ogether.  (
I
 
especially encourage me mbers o
f t
he
 
same f
amily t
o t
ake up d
ifferent i
n-
s
tru ments;  t
hey can have l
ots more
 
f
un t
hat way.)  Obviously, however, i
n
 
a c
lass o
f f
ifteen guitars, t
hree man-
dolins and two banjos, t
he bulk o
f i
n-
s
truction  will  be g
iven t
he guitars.
 
For really advanced work on e
ither
 
mandolin or banjo, separate i
nstruction
 
must be g
iven; t
his can sometimes be
 
worked i
n before or a
fter c
lass; o
ther-
wise f
it i
t i
n during a
 break i
n t
he l
es-
son, g
iving t
he guitarists a chance t
o
 
rest t
heir hands. Or, most e
fficiently,
 
an occasional private session.
 
For beginning i
nstruction, t
hough, I
 
have  had  no t
rouble working i
n a
ll
 
t
hree i
nstruments. Each group has i
ts
 
own chord sheet;  I g
ive separate i
n-
s
tructions on r
ight hand, working i
n
 
more e
laborate beats j
ust as I
 do f
or
 
t
he guitarists.  Even i
n t
he second or
 
t
hird l
esson you can get some r
eal
 
music by s
tarting with one i
nstrument
 
and bringing i
n t
he o
thers i
n series,
 
with t
heir own d
ifferent r
hyth m pat-
t
erns.  At about t
he t
ime I
 am t
eaching
 
t
he guitar runs, I
 bring i
n melody writ-
t
en out f
or t
he o
ther i
nstruments; f
or
 
t
his I
 have developed a
 syste m, chiefly
 
valuable  because  i
t can  be written
 
quickly on t
he t
ypewriter, i
n which t
he
 
s
tring i
s i
ndicated by a
 number on t
he
 
f
irst l
ine and t
he f
ret by a
 number on
 
t
he t
op l
ine.  Thus t
he second f
ret on
 
t
he f
irst s
tring (
any i
nstrument) would
 
be written:

With such a notation written over
 
t
he  words  o
f  a song,  melody  (
or
 
counter- melody) can be easily f
ollowed
 
even by a
 beginner. Of course, anyone
 
who wants t
o get f
urther will have t
o
 
l
earn music notation eventually; how-
ever, I
 f
ind so many people have real
 
b
locks against f
ormal music i
nstruc-
t
ion t
hat t
he l
onger I
 can delay anything
 
t
echnical, t
he easier i
t i
s f
or t
he m.
 
And t
hen t
here are t
he p
eople who will
 
never l
earn f
ormal music but prefer t
o
 
develop t
heir own improvisation, and
 
t
hat's great t
oo.
 
Almost a
ll t
he people I
 t
each suffer
 
deep f
eelings o
f i
nferiority about mu-
s
ic; t
hey can't s
ing, t
hey c

For t

(

Don't  t

Use rounds where you don't need

Develop sense o

I
ntroduce double t

t

can c

Don't  p

o
f t
his unique musical venture. Here's
 
what he says:
 
How I
 Co mposed*
 The Goofing-Off Suite
 
I
n Lenox,  Massachusetts, home o
f
 
t
he Berkshire Music Festival, I
 chanced
 
t
o hear a
 cha mber music program l
ast
 
su m mer.  I
t
's great stuf
f** and f
olk
 
musicians should hear more o
f i
t
.  I
n
 
between each move ment o
f a
 Suite t
here
 
i
s absolute s
ilence because music i
s
 
Holy, or should be.
 
I
 f
igured f
olk musicians should t
ry
 
t
o write s
o me Suites, and here i
s my
 
f
irst a
tte mpt.  When i
t ca me t
o choos-
i
ng a
 name f
or i
t
, I
 was s
tuck. Finally,
 
I
 decided on The Goofing-Off Suite.
 
Here's t
he reason.  I
f you want t
o
 
l
earn a f
olk i
nstru ment, s
uch as gui-
t
ar, you'll never get around t
o i
t i
f you
 
say,  "
I'll practise f
or an hour every
 
Thursday a
t 5
:30."  You j
ust never get
 
around t
o i
t
.  Not unless you know how
 
t
o goof o
ff.
 
I was t
eaching a housewife how t
o
 
p
lay guitar, near my ho me i
n t
he Hud-
son Valley, and she wasn't making any
 
progress a
t a
ll. I
 t
old her, "Forget t
he
 
d
ishes, f
orget t
he beds and t
he sweep-
i
ng f
or a while."  And you know next
 
week she really had made some pro-
gress.
 
I
'll admit I
'm i
n a
 f
avored position.
 
I
n my ho me everybody can be working
 
t
o beat t
he band, and I
'm l
ying on t
he
 
bed, p
lunking away a
t t
he banjo.  The
 
k
ids say, "Papa's practising."
 
So  t
his  i
s my Goofing-Of
f Suite.
 
You'll notice i
t has a
 nu mber o
f chan-
ges o
f mood i
n i
t
.  After a
ll, barriers
 
are  being broken down a
ll over t
he
 
world, between races, nations and peo-
p
les.  We might as well break dawn a
 
f
ew musical barriers and show t

 Can't Carry A T
une.
 
by Bess Hawes
 
I
n my experience t
eaching guitar
 
accompaniment t
o f
olk songs, t
he i
n-
ability t
o carry a
 t
uneis mentioned by
 
most people only i
n private, and usu-
a
lly i
n  embarrassed  and  desperate
 
t
ones, somewhat as t
hough i
t were a
 
com municable  d
isease  or  a f
amily
 
scandal.  I
t seems t
o me t
hat i
t
's h
igh
 
t
ime t
o bring up the subject i
n SING
 
OUT, i
f only t
o assure t
he readers who
 
have this d
ifficulty t
hat t
hey are not
 
a
lone.
 
Before I
 make any k
ind o
f practical
 
suggestions, however, I
 should say t
hat
 
I
 am not a professional voice t
eacher
 
and personally t
ry t
o s
teer away f
rom
 
anything t
hat might come i
nto t
he area
 
o
f vocal t
raining.  But s
inging i
s a
 
natural thing,  l
ike speech, f
or which
 
we need special t
raining only i
n special
 
c
ircumstances.  I
n f
act, t
he f
irst t
hing
 
t
o know about s
inging i
s t
hat i
t i
s an
 
extension o
f speech.  Most people do
 
not realize t
he extent t
o which t
heir
 
voice varies i
n p
itch when t
hey are
 
t
alking.
 (
"Pitch" s
imply means t
he
 
h
ighness or l
owness o
f musical t
ones;
 
when you say you can't carry a
 t
une, i
t
 
means t
hat you can't control t
he p
itch
 
o
f your s
inging.)

Try  saying  something  a
loud -
 
MARY HAD A LITTLE LA MB or t
he
 
DEC LARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
 
-
 without a
llowing your voice t
o go up
 
or down a
t a
ll. People who have been
 
born t
otally deaf sometimes speak this
 
way, a
ll on one note; or e
lse t
hey may
 
change  their  p
itch on i
nappropriate
 
words.  Try doing t
his, t
oo, and you
 
will begin t
o see t
hat you are actually
 
s
inging when you speak nor mally.
 
I
f you i
nflect normally when you
 
speak (
that i
s, i
f your voice goes up
 
and down i
n p
itch i
n a normally ex-
pressive manner) you are not t
one deaf;
 
you can s
ing; a
ll you nee&—l
s practice.
 
ThisTil' t
he f
irst s
tep: s
ing, as much
 
as you can, as o
ften as you can.  Sing
 
with enthusias m; open your mouth and
 
l
et f
ly.  Solitude i
s o
ften helpful; t
he
 
bathroom not only has t
he advantage o
f
 
good acoustics but i
s great f
or privacy.
 
Sing with t
he radio;  hum  with  t
he
 
Muzak i
n t
he super- market;  j
oin a
 
chorus,  t
he b
igger t
he better;  just
 
s
ing a l
ot i
n any c
ircumstances you
 
can contrive.
 
The second suggestion: s
ing l
oud-
Most people who are nervous
 
[heir p
itch s
ing so softly t
hat t
hey can't
 
hear whether t
hey're on or o
ff;  this
 
t
ends t
o prolong t
he problem. Besides,
 
-24-
i
t 
-
25-
s
inging softly requires more control
 
t
han f
ull voice;  i
t
's much easier t
o
 
wobble  when you're not putting any
 
power behind t
he t
one.
 
At t
his point, we run up against t
he
 
r
ealdiffiCultY. I
f you t
hought you could  
s
ing well, t
hen obviously you would
 
s
ing a
ll t
he t
ime.  S
imilarly,  i
T3dii
 
weren't sure t
hat you'd h
it t
he wrong
 
n
ote, t
hen o
f c
ourse you'd s
ing out n
ice
 
and l
oud.  The only real safety there-
f
ore l
ies i
n not s
inging a
t a
ll.
 
The crux o
f t
his v
icious c
ircle (
you
 
won't s
ing because you can't s
ing, and
 
you can't because you won't)  i
s,  i
t
 
see ms t
o me, t
hat the voice i
s one o
f
 
our  most  p
ersonal possessions.
 I
t
 
co mes r
ight up f
rom down i
n our i
n-
s
ides; i
t's a
ll mixed up with t
he v
ital
 
f
unctions o
f breathing and swallowing.
 
When you're nervous you can't seem t
o
 
get enough a
ir, something goes haywire
 
with your saliva, your t
hroat t
ightens
 
and so your voice really does go out o
f
 
control.
 
This see ms t
o be how most people's
 
s
inging  proble m  s
tarted.
 At  some
 
point i
n t
heir childhood they were t
old
 
t
hat  t
hey  weren't s
inging t
hat song
 
r
ights or t
he t
eacher said not to s
ing
 
w
ith t
he chorus, "
just move your l
ips,"
 
or somebody l
aughed a
t a brave a
tte mpt
 
a
t an out-of-range note.  This appar-
ently needs only t
o happen once f
or t
he
 
v
icti m t
o decide t
hat neve Tã ain will
 
he expose h
is voice -
 t
hat precious,
 
personal i
nside t
hing o
f h
i m -
 t
o the
 
unfeeling world.  I
 have been t
old so
 
many s
tories o
f t
his k
ind by so many
 
adults that I
 have begun t
o f
eel t
hat t
o
 
t
ell a child t
hat he can't s
ing i
s about
 
equivalent,  psychologically speaking,
 
t
o telling h
im t
o s
top breathing -
 or
 
drop dead, as far as t
hat goes.
 
Consequently, i
n order t
o recover
 
f
ro m t
hese shattering experiences, t
ry
 
t
o  reverse t
he process o
f  acquired
 
t
ensi
on as f
ar as you can.
 
1
.  Get i
nto as comfortable a s
itu-
a
tion f
or s
inging as you can f
ind.  I
n
 
addition t
o s
inging by yourself, I
 h
ighly
 
recom mend s
inging with a group.  You
 
will f
ind much more privacy i
n acrowd
 
t
han i
n a private l
esson with a voice
 
coach where you have t
o do i
t al
l by
 
yourself;  besides,  group s
inging i
s
 
f
un, relaxing and sharpens your ear.
 
Most amateur s
ingers are t
oo busy
 
l
istening  t
o t
hemselves t
o l
isten to
 
you, and once you realize this, you
 
will f
eel much more comfortable about
 
s
inging out n
ice and l
oud.
 
2
.  Distract  yourself  f
ro m  your
 
own personal worries about your s
ing-
i
ng. Learning an accompanying i
nstru-
ment such as guitar or banjo may help
 
enor mously,  mostly,  I believe,  be-
cause t
he s
tudent i
s so busy t
rying t
o
 
p
lay t
hat he doesn't even notice t
hat
 
he's s
inging. I
 have seen a
 voice coach
 
so d
istract a s
tudent,  by continually
 
yelling a
t h
im t
o drop h
is j
aw and open
 
h
is mouth wider, t
hat the s
tudent was
 
suddenly s
inging accurately a
 note t
hat
 
he couldn't h
it a moment before when
 
he was t
rying t
o with al
l h
is a
ttention.
 
3
.  Don't t
hink o
f s
inging exclu-
s
ively i
n t
er ms o
f public perfor mance.
 
Remember  that  i
n  many  societies,
 
people s
ing any o
ld t
ime, not j
ust i
n
 
f
or mal s
ituations. I
 was p
laying a
 f
ield
 
holler t
o a
 c
lass once when a
 g
irl said,
 
i
n t
ones o
f t
otal astonishment,  "You
 
mean t
hey j
ust s
ing r
ight out l
ike t
hat
 
i
n t
he middle o
f what they're doing?"
 
I
 asked her i
f she d
idn't ever s
ing when
 
she
 was doing the d
ishes or driving a
 
car, and apparently the i
dea had never
 
occurred t
o her.
 So far as she was
 
concerned, music only happened when
 
one bunch o
f people got a
ll organized
 
t
o perform and another bunch got the m-
selves organized t
o l
isten. Try s
inging
 
when you're really doing  something
 
e
lse; i
t will l
ikely improve your per-
f
or mance i
n both directions.
 
4
.  Don't worry a
t this s
tage about
 
l
earning t
o read music  -
 i
t
's  un-
necessary and beside the point.  Sing
 
as much as possible f
rom  memory,
 
without even using word sheets.
 We
 
have  a  very  eye-oriented  society;
 
com munication by t
he written word i
s
 
so v
itally important t
o us t
hat we have
 
l
earned t
o e
liminate a
ll o
ther s
timuli
 
a
lmost  automatically  when  we  are
 
reading.  This i
s a
 marvellously e
ffi-
-26-
c
ient system f
or s
tudying a
 book, but
 
many people have become so h
ighly
 
conditioned t
hat t
hey t
urn t
heir ears o
ff
 
t
he i
nstant they s
tart t
o read anything.
 
Every once i
n a while I
 t
urn out t
he
 
l
ights when I
'm t
eaching a
 guitar c
lass;
 
i
t
's amazing how t
he music suddenly
 
swells out.  I
t was there a
ll the t
ime,
 
o
f course; we j
ust d
idn't hear i
t.  Try
 
s
inging i
n the dark yourself -
 i
t
's a
 
l
ovely co mfortable f
eeling; re me mber
 
how n
ice i
t was when you sang around
 
a campfire when you were a k
id.
 
5
.  This l
ast paragraph may sound
 
corny, but t
o me i
t
's t
he most impor-
tant o
f a
ll.  Try thinking about what
 
you're s
inging.  Get i
nto the song; be-
l
ieve in what you're saying when you
 
s
ing; t
ry t
o f
ind some sense o
f per-
sonal dentitv with t
he  eople who have
 
sung t
his song nerore you.  I
 think one
 
o
f t
he greatest dangers i
n the current
 
f
olk music boom i
s t
hat we may be-
come so impressed by t
he v
irtuoso
 
perfor mer t
hat we will f
orget that what
 
really makes a
 f
olk song i
s i
ts content,
 
i
ts humanity,  i
ts relationship t
o l
ife,
 
i
ts com mon-ness.  When  you  come
 
r
ight down t
o i
t, i
f you can s
ing "Go
 
Tell Aunt Rhody" to your child i
n such
 
a way that he senses t
hat you l
ove h
im
 
and t
hat people a
ll over the world and
 
t
hroughout t
ime have l
oved and will
 
l
ove,  then i
t doesn't really matter a
 
scrap whether you're o
ff-key or on.
 
And when you can really believe t
his,
 
and when you can really l
ose yourself
 
enough t
o do i
t -
 your p
itch will be
 
solid as a rock.
 
A f
ew suggestions i
f you're t
rying
 
t
o help so mebody l
earn t
o s
ing.
 
1
.  Never never say they're o
ff-
p
itch. Think ofi
ething encouraging
 
t
o say: they have a
 l
overy voice, t
heir
 
d
iction i
s f
irst-rate -
 i
f your back i
s
 
absolutely  t
o  the  wall,  compliment
 
t
heir choice o
f song. S
imilarly, choke
 
o
ff any relatives or what  Leadbelly
 
used t
o call "
so-called f
riends" who
 
make  unpleasant  re marks.
 You're
 
t
rying t
o build up a
 badly damaged self-
confidence.  You'll f
ind you won't have
 
t
o f
lat-out l
ie; j
ust build up t
he good
 
things.
 
2
.  I
f your f
riend i
s worried about
 
a l
imited range, point out t
hat he can
 
a
lways s
ing n
ice h
igh or l
ow parts that
 
use only a f
ew notes.  Don't be a
fraid
 
t
o t
each h
im a s
imple part; being able
 
t
o s
ing i
n har mony will improve h
is
 
morale enormously. At t
he same t
ime,
 
encourage h
i m t
o s
tretch h
is voice both
 
ways.
 
3
.  Remember that many people do
 
not hear t
he octave c
learly a
t f
irst.  I
f
 
you're a woman working with a
 man, i
t
 
may help a l
ot i
f you growl a
long i
n h
is
 
range,  even t
hough you sound pretty
 
awful  yourself.
 Or t
ry p
laying t
he
 
melody i
n t
he bass.
 
4
.  I
t o
ften helps t
o f
ind out what
 
song your f
riend really would l
ove t
o
 
be able to s
ing.  A l
ong t
ime ago I
 ran
 
i
nto a g
irl who was an ardent f
ree
 
I
risher; her l
ifelong ambition was t
o
 
s
ing Kevin Barry. I
t was a
 pretty s
tiff
 
order and I
 d
idn't t
hink she'd ever get
 
t
he "
15o not hang me l
ike a
 dog" part,
 
but a
fter about three months o
f solid
 
Kevin Barry she made i
t
. (
I l
ost t
rack
 
o
f her a
fter t
'hat t
riumph and don't know
 
i
f she ever sang anything e
lse.)  The
 
point i
s t
hat t
he principles o
f s
inging
 
on p
itch are t
he same f
or hard songs
 
and easy ones; and you might as well
 
be s
inging something you really enjoy.
 
5
.  Use every device you can t
hink
 
o
f t
o encourage l
istening, relaxation,
  
and confidence; t
hese seem t
o be t
he
 
crux o
f t
he whole problem.

the  first steo:  sing, as much as you can, as often as you can. Sing with
 
enthusiasm; open your mouth and let fly. Solitude is often helpful;
 
the bathroom not only has the advantage of good acoustics but is great
 
for privacy. Sing with the radio; hum with the Muzak in the super-market;
 
join a chorus, the bigger the better;  just sing a lot in any circumstances
 
you can contrive.
 
The second suggestion:  sing  loudly. Most people who are nervou
 
about their p
itch sing  so softly that they can't hoar whether they're on
 
or off; this tends to prolong the problem. Besides, singing softly require
 
more control than full voice; it's muoh easier to wobble when you're not
 
rutting any power behind the tone.
 
At this point, we run up against the real difficulty. If you
 
thought you could s
ing well, then obviously you would sing all the time.
 
Similarly, if you weren't sure that you'd hit the wrong note, then of
 
course you'd sing out nice and loud. The only real safety lids in not
 
singing at all. The crux of this vicious circle is, it seems to me, that
 
the voice is one of our most personal oossessions. It conies right up from
 
down in our insides; it's all mixed up with the vital functions of breathi
 
and swallowing. When you're nervous you can't seem to get enough air,
 
saliva
 
something goes haywire with your xxx3f
tax , your throat tightens and so your
 
voice really does go out of control.
 
This seems to be how most peonle's s
inging oroblem started.
 
At some poi.t in their childhood they were told that they weren't singing
 
that song right, or the teacher said not to sing with the chorus,"just
 
move your  lips", or somebody laughed at a brave attempt at an out-of-range
 
note. This apparently needs only to haopen once for the victim to decide
 
that never again will he expose his voice -
-
 that precious, personal insid
 
thing of his -
-
 to the cold cruel world. I have been told so many stories
 
-3
 
of this kind by so many adults that 1 have begun to feel that to tell
 
a child that he can't s
ing is about equivalent, psychologically sneaking,
 
to tellinc, him to stop breathing -
-
 or drop dead, as far as that goes.
 
Conse'
-
,uentiv, in order to recover from these shattering
 
exaeriences, try to reverse the p
rocess of acquired tension as far as
 
yoa caa.
 
l
• Get into as comfortable a situation for singing as you can
 
i
ition to s
inging by yourself, I highly recommend s
inging  with
 
a group. You will find much more privacy in a crowd than in a private
 
lesson with a voice coach where you have to do it all by yourself; beside
 
group singing is fun, relaxing and sharpens your ear. host amateur singerE
 
are too busy listening to themselves to listen to you, and once you rea1i2
 
this, you will feel much more comfortable about s
inging out nice and loud
 
2. Distract yourself from your own personal worries about
 
your singing. Learning an accor
noanying instrument such as guitar or banjo
 
may helo enormously, mostly, I believe, because the patient is so busy
 
trying to clay that he doesn't even notice that he's s
inging. I have seen
 
a voice coahh so distract a student, by continually yelling at him to
 
drop his jaw and open his mouth wider, that the student was suddenly
 
s
inging accurately a note that he couldn't hit a moment before when he
 
was trying to with all his attention.

. Don't think of singing exclusively in terms of public
 
oerforrnance. Remember that in many societies,  oeople s
ing any old time,
 
not just in formal s
ituations. I was playing a field holler to a class
 
once when a girl said, in tones of total astonishment, "You mean they
 
just s
ing right out like that in the middle of what they're doing?"
 
I asked her if she didn't ever sing when she was doing the dishes or
 
driving a car, and apparently the idea had never occurred to her. So far
 
-4
 
as she was concerned, music only haopened when one bunch of oeople got
 
all organized to perform and another bunch got themselves organized to
 
listen. Try singing when you're really doing something else; it will
 
likely improve your performance in both directions.
 
4. Don't worry at this stage about learning to read music
 
it's unnecessary and beside the point. Sing as much as possible from
 
memory, without even using word sheets. We have a very eye-oriented
 
society:  communication by the written word is so desoerately important
 
to us that we have learned to eliminate a
ll other stimuli almost automatic
 
when we are reading. This Is a marvellously efficient system for studying
 
a book, but many people have become so highly conditioned that the/turn
 
their ears off the instant they start to read anything. Every once in a
 
while I turn out the lights when I'm teaching a guitar class; it's
 
amazing how the music suddenly swells out. it was there all the time, of
 
course: we just didn't hear it. Try singing in the dark yourself -
-
 it's
 
a lovely comfortable feeling  remember how nice it was when you a
 
a campfire when you were a kid.
 
5. This last paragraph may sound corny, but to me it's
 
ng aroun
 
the
 
Most, important of all. Try thinking about what you're s
inging. Get into th
 
song; believe in what you're saying when you s
ing; don't sing trashy
 
material or songs that don't carry conviction fo
you. I think one of the
 
greatest dangers in the current folk music boom is that we may become so
 
impressed by the v
irtuoso performer that we will forget that what really
 
makes a folk song is its content, its humanity, its reiationsiip to life,
 
its common-ness, if you will. When you come right down to it, if you can
 
sing "Go Tell Aunt Rhody" to your child in such a way that he knows that
 
you love him and that people all over the world and throughout time have
 
loved and will love, then it doesn't really matter a scrap whether you're
 
- 5
 
off-key or on.  nd when you can really believe this, and when you can
 
really lose yourself enough to do it -
-
 your oitch will be solid as a rod
 
A few suggestions if you're trying to help so ebody learn to sing.
 
1
. Never never say they're off-pitch. Think of something nice to say:
 
they have a lovely voice, their diction is first-rate -
-
 if your back
 
is absolutely to the wall, compliment their choice of song. Later on,
 
tell them how well they hit such-and-such a note; don't mention the
 
others. Similarly, choke off any relatives or what' Leadbelly used to
 
ciii "so-called friends" who make unpleasant remarks. You're trying
 
to build UD  a badly damaged self-confidence. You'll find you v n't
 
have to flat-out lie;  just build up the good things.
 
2. If your friend is worried about a limited range, point out that
 
he can always s
ing nice high or low carts that use only a few notes.
 
Don't be afraid to teach him a simple part;  being able to sing in harr
n
 
mon  will imnrove his morale enormously. At the same time, encourage
 
him to stretch his voice both ways.
 
3. Remember that many people do not hear the octave clearly. If yO u' rE
 
a woman working with a man, it may help it a lot if you grow' along
 
in his range, even though you sound pretty awful yourself. Or try
 
playing the melody in the bass.
 
4. It often helps to find out what song your friend really would love
 
to be able to sing. A long time ago I ran into a girl who was an
 
ardent free Irisher; her lifelong ambition wis to sing Kevin Barry. 
It was a p
retty stiff order, and I didn't think she'd eve
' get the
 
"Do not hang me like a dog" part, but after about three months of
 
solid Kevin Barry, she made it.  (
I lost track of her after that tri-
umph and don't know if she ever sang anything else.) The coint is that
 
the principles of singing on pitch are the same for hard songs and
 
easy ones; and you might as well be singing something you really enjo
 
5. Use every device you can think of to encourage listening, relaxatic 
and confidence: these seem to be the crux of the whole problem.
