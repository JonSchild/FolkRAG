Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1872, by A. 7.1 
FISHER, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington, 
PAT WON'T GO HOME TILL MORNING. 
Composed and sung by J. IL RYAN, now performing with Merchant's 
Panorama of Ireland, as " Rory the Royer: , 
THE dawn upon the hill was breaking, the stars were twinkling 
in the sky. 
As Pat upon the ground lay dreaming, his big shiRelah lay close 
by, 
All night the whiskey he's been drinking, and now he wakens 
from his drunken snore, 
He calls for drink to make him frisky, and swears because there 
is DO more. 
CHORUS. 
Then fill up the bowl, hurrah 1 
for a 
thirsty soul, ha ! ha 
Art night on.a spree, my boys, my throat with fire is burning, 
Dance so blithe and gay,hurrah! none like Pat can be, ha! ha! 
Divil a 
hair I 
care, my boys, we won't go home till morning. 
The moon upon the bogs was gleaming, and the lambs were 
bleating in the shed, 
The pigs and sows the swill are raking, and the gossons waiting 
to be fed, 
Pat home from the wake is trudging slowly; with divil a 
farth-
ing in his purse, 
Besides his pockets are both holey, and credit to poor Pat not 
worth a 
curse. 
Then fill up, (46c. 
The night and fun again advances, and the song and dance 
again goes '
rrinid, 
And Pat again is nimbly drinking, until with whiskey he gets 
drowned, 
All night he's been swigging at the bottle, and now he tumbles 
fiat upon the floor. 
Yet still the boys and girls are dancing, but Pat's asleep to 
dance no more.

Man is but a 
Pipe and His Life is but Smoke. 
As Originally sung by JOHNNY RO ACH. 
CONTENTED I 
sit with my pipe and my glass, 
Puffing sorrow and care far away, 
Though liquor may banish man's reason afar, 
He's only a 
fool or a 
sot, 
While his sense and his reason are always at war, 
He don't know when enough he has got.

011011IIS. 
Though many may laugh, others may joke, 
Man's but a 
pipe and his life is but smoke. 
Now man and a 
pipe are much nearer to kin, 
Than ever you have understood, 
For until with breath they are both filled within, 
Pray tell me for what are they good; 
For the one and the other composed are of clay, 
And if right I 
tell nature's plan, 
It takes but the breath from them both right away, 
The pipe dies and so doth the man. 
Though many may, &c. 
Now I'm told by my pipe man's lot is to die, 
For sooner or later he must, 
And when to the end of life's journey he's got, 
Like a 
pipe that's smoked out he's but dust; 
Then all you that wish in your hearts to be gay, 
Encourage not grief, strife nor sorrow, 
Make much of your pipe of tobacco to-day, 
For you may be smoked out on the morrow. 
Though many may, ttc.

THE CHARCOAL MAN. 
Composed and Sung by GEORGE W ELLING, the Great Comique. 
ublin Carman. 
MY name is Denny Conner, I 
am a 
charcoal man, 
And if you will but listen, you'll see I'm an Irishman, 
I 
was born in Dublin City, that place of great renown, 
But now I'm here in America and peddling charcoal 
through the town. 
CHORUS. 
Charcoal is my cry, I 
make the old horse git, 
And if he does go slow you'll bet I 
use the whip, 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, her name was Rosy 
Ann, 
She said r 
was a 
genius and she'd have no other man ; 
But now she's gone and left me, for a 
fellow by the name 
of McGee, 
-Who peddles sawdust around the the city and my Rosy 
no more I'll see. 
Charcoal is my cry, &c. 
(inc day when they were riding the horse he took a 
fright, 
And ran away with Rosy and never stopped till night, 
He ran way up to Harlem Bridge, Rosy screamed with all 
her might, 
He upset the charcoal wagon and threw Rosy out of 
sight. 
Charcoal is my cry, &c. 
When McGee saw this cruel thing, 
it was more than he 
could stand, 
He drew out his revolver and blew himself off the 
land, 
So now I'm left alone, to lead a 
single life, 
And to peddle charcoal as you see, with no Rosy for my 
wife. 
Charcoal is my cry, Scc._

PAT ROACH AT THE PLAY, 
Music of this song can,be obtained of E. H. HARDING, 288 Bowery. 
AS Pat Roach and the missus from Galway, 
in Dublin once happened to be, 
To the playhouse they went one fine evening, 
Determined diversion to see; 
But says Pat as he entered there's no one, 
Pay here," cried a 
voice, " holy murther," 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
Pay here," cries a 
voice, " holy rnurther," 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
The missus she looked all around her, 
In wonder her eyes they did roll, 
But says she " Paddy darling, alanna, 
He is here like a 
rat in a 
hole, 
Pay here, how much is it ? a 
shilling; 
A 
shilling apiece, that won't do, 
'Tis too much, Mister Pay here avourneen, 
Eighteen pince I 
will give you for two, 
'Tis too much, Mister Pay here avourneen, 
s Eighteen pince I 
will give you for two. 
Pat grumbled but paid and got seated, 
The band was beginning to play, 
He j 
igg'd on his seat quite elated, 
And to the musicians did say, 
"Tis yer selves that can do it, me bouchals, 
And I 
wish to ye's wid all my mind, 
To the fiddlers more power to your elbows,', 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, yer wind, 
To the fiddlers more power to your elbows, 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, yer wind. 
The play then went on, and Pat wondered, 
And sat with his mouth open wide, 
As the proud haughty Lord of the Manor, 
Sought to make the fair maiden his bride; 
"To the mountains," says he, " I 
will bear thee," 
She shrieked as she saw him approach, 
" 
Is there no one at hand now to save me?" 
Shouts a 
voice, " yis, me darlin, Pat Roach." 
Then up on the seat, jumped brave Paddy. 
Says he, " now you blackguard, be gone, 
Or a 
lord though you be, tin times over, 
I'll knock your two eyes into one:— 
" 
Sit down there in front!" " what you spalpeen," 
Is it me you thus dar to addriss, 
De ye think that Pat Roach would sit aisy, 
And see that poor girl in distress? 
A 
scuffle ensued in a 
minute, 
But soon sure the row did subside. 
And as Pat gasped for breath he discovered, 
Of the door he was on the wrong side; 
He soon found the missus, next morning 
They started for home, and Pat swore, 
If he once safely landed in Galway, 
he'd come up to Dublin no more. 
Written and sung by JOUNNT ItoACh with great. success. 
PADDY BURKE was a 
man of work, from Limerick town he 
came, 
lie married a 
buxom Irish lass, and she went by the name of 
Kane; 
Now Pat and his wife, through six years' strife, were never 
blessed with a 
child, 
And when she seen one in any one's arms, this is what she'd 
CTIORT:S. 
Rock the cradle, Pat, rock the cradle, Pat, 
There's many a 
man would give his right arm, 
To have a 
child like that. 
Now the war broke out, and Paddy, stout, he swore he'd go 
and ' list; 
To hear his wife's tongue always ding-dong, ' twould drive him 
out of his wits; 
So off he went, left her to repent, for doing a 
thing so wrong, 
For fathering him with that mortal sin, and singing that beastly 
song: 
Rock the cradle, Pat, ikc, 
Now Paddy Burke, this man 01 work, he hadn't been long 
away. 
Till his wife fell in with a•big spalpeen who soon lea her astray; 
For three years long there love was strong, till one tine summer's 
day, 
Paddy Burke, this man of work, came singing her favorite lay: 
Rock the cradle, Pat, & c. 
Well, Pat looked round, and soon he found a 
baby hale and 
strong, 
And turning to his wife, the pride of his life, said, 
" 
Who L 
us been here since I 
was gone ? 
"It was Provilence, Pat," she said, " done that, he was good 
to me three years long, 
And now you can, with my other man, sing my favorite song. 
Rock the cradle, Pat, sx.

THE BRIDGE. 
As Sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
I 
STOOD on the bridge at midnight, 
As the clocks were striking the hour: 
And the moon rose o'er the city, 
Rehind the dark church-tower. 
And, like the waters rushing 
Among the wooden piers, 
A 
flood of thoughts came o'er me, 
That filled my eyes with tears— 
How often, oh! how often, 
In the days that ha,d gone by, 
I 
had stood on that bridge, at midnight, 
And gazed on that wave and sky ! 
How often, oh! how often, 
In the days that had gone by, 
I 
had stood on that bridge, at midnight, 
And gazed oL that wave and sky! 
How often, oh! how often, 
I 
had wished that that ebbing tide 
Wouid bear me away on its bosom. 
O'er the ocean wild and wide! 
For my heart was hot and restless, 
And my life was full of care: 
And the burthen laid upon me 
Seemed greater than I 
could bear— 
But now it has fallen from me, 
It is buried in the sea: 
And only the sorrow of others 
Throws its shadow over me; 
Yet, whenever I 
cross the river, 
On its bridge with wooden piers, 
Like the odor of brine from the ocean, 
Comes the thought of other years: 
And for ever, and for ever, 
As long as the river flows, 
As long as the heart has passions, 
As long as life has woes. 
The moon and its broken reflection, 
And its shadows shall appear 
As the symbol of love in Heaven 
Andlits wavering image here.

BOLD IRISH PAT. 
AIR—Bloated Young A ristocrat. 
Written and Sung by the great noAcu, Irish Comique. 
AN Irishman named Paddy Carey, 
has come to sing for you to-night; 
I 
came from a 
town in Tipperary, 
Where we had many a 
fight : 
But the girls and the boys there are witty, 
You can bet your last cent upon that, 
And in my own beautiful city, 
They call me Bowld Irish Pat. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, you can see by the way that I 
talk, 
The shape of my stick and hat, 
Sober or tight, I'm in for a 
fight, 
hurrah, boys, for Bowld Irish Pat. 
The Saxon of late has been us troublin', 
That's the reason Oiat I 
came away, 
I 
paid my passage down to Dublin, 
And then I 
crossed over the sea; 
When I 
landed safe in tliL city, 
I 
was met by a 
chap they called Mat, 
Who welcc 
-d 
me to this country, 
Saying, how are you, Bowld Irish Pat. 
Yes, you can see by the way, & c. 
But I 
like the ways of this country, 
Where a 
man can live by his toil, 
And if he 
earnest and patient, 
He ma.) soon own a 
bit of the soil; 
ry€ bought a 
line farm down in Jersey, 
And am going to live upon that, 
And if o,. w,,nt to come and see me, 
you'll be welcomed by Bowld Irish Pat. 
Yes, you can see by the way, & C.

WON'T you tell me, Mollie darling, 
That you love none else but me? 
For I

Mollie, fairest, sweetest, dearest, 
Look up, darling, tell me this: 
Do you love me, Mollie darling? 
Let your answer be a 
kiss. 
Stars are smiling, Mollie darling, 
Through the mystic vail of night; 
They seem laughing, Mollie darling, 
While fair Luna hides her light; 
Oh! no one listens but the flowers, 
While they hang their heads in shaine, 
They are modest, Mbllie darling, 
When they hear me call your name. 
Mollie, fairest, &c. 
I 
must leave you, Mollie darling, 
Though the parting gives me pain; 
When the stars shine, Mollie darling, 
I 
will meet you here again. 
Oh! good- night, Mollie, good-bye, loved one. 
happy may you ever be, 
When you're dreaming, Mollie darling, 
Don't forget to dream of me. 
Mollie, fairest,

COURTING IN THE RAIL 
ONE April morn, when walking down, 
A 
quiet country lane, 
I 
overtook a 
fair young girl, 
Whilst hurrying through the rain. 
I 
asked her " If she would accept 
My arm and take a 
share 
Of my umbrella ?" " Thanks, kind Sir, 
I 
will," replied the fair. 
SPOKEN.—One with golden locks, by Jove, and without one 
of those useful articles (holding up "Umbrella)---when she 
popped her little arm in mine, my heart beat to that degree it 
nearly dislocated my 
ribs (of the Umbrella I 
mean) it's a 
fact: I 
thought to myself, here's a 
chance to go— 
CHORUS. 
Courting in the rain, courting in the rain, 
I 
ne'er regret the day I 
met my charmer in the lane: 
Courting in the rain, courting in the rain, 
'Twas sweeter far than moon or star, 
Whilst courting Mary Jane. 
The rain poured down alarmingly, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it: 
There I 
quickly learnt her name. 
She also told me where she lived, 
With Pa dcovn at the farm, 
A 
farmer's daughter: well, said I, 
That is an extra charm. 
15 
SPOKEN. — I 
glory to country life, and a 
farmer's daughter--
what could be better? I 
wished the rain would keep on as 
rather liked— 
Courting in the rain, &a 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright, 
The little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light— 
I 
gently pressed her arm in mine, 
And said: " Now don't say nay, 
But let me come and meet you here 
Again, some other day." 
SPOKEN.— " 
Well, she said, I 
can't exactly decide, you must 
ask my Pa— " 
So I 
made up my mind to go in and inform tha 
old gentleman we'd been 
Courting in the rain, &c. 
We reached the old farm-house, and then 
She introduded tO me 
Her Pa, a 
jolly nice old boy, 
With him I 
made quite free: 
I 
told him where and when I'd met, 
His daughter in the rain, 
And blessed the lucky chance that took 
Me down that country lane— 
SPOKEN.—The old gentleman was quite delignted with my 
kind attention, mil soon gained his consent, which proves the 
truth of the old proverb—" It never rains but it pours," and so 
it occurred to me through— 
Courting in the rain, (ke, 
KILLARNEY. 
published in B. W. Hitchcock's Half Dime series. 
By Killarney's lakes and fells, 
Em'rald isles and winding bays, 
Mountain paths and woodland dells, 
Mem'ry ever fondly strays. 
Bounteous nature loves all lands, 
Beauty wanders ev'ry where, 
Footprints leaves on many strands; 
But her home is surely there ! 
Angels fold their wings, and rest 
In that Eden of the west, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Innisfallen's ruin' d 
shrine, 
May suggest a 
passing sigh, 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by, 
Castle Lough and Glenna Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagle's Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Ange's wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye, 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints. 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn Spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries daft' the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there,. 
Doubt if Eden were more fair, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney, 
Music there for Echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in eestacy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud wreaths in that sky. 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine, 
Beauty's home. Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL THE 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
WHEN a 
child I 
lived at Lincoln with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm; 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of childish 
play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mother 
say— 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach; 
Let your watchword be " dispatch," and practice what you 
preach; 
Do not let your chances, like sunbeams, pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seem'd my only sport, it was my only joy; 
And well do I 
remember, when ofttimes well chastised, 
How father sat beside me then and thus has me advised. 
Waste not, & c. 
When I 
arrived at manhood, I 
embark d 
in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road bestrewn with care and strife; 
I 
speculated foo:ishly, my losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny, little voice kept whisp'ring in mine ear. 
Waste not, (Sze. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, and found, to my surprise, 
My funds, instead of sinking, very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasp'd each chance and always struck the iron while ' twas 
hot, 
I 
seild my opportunities and never once forgot— 
Waste not, & c. 
Im' married now and happy , I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony, devoid of care and strife; 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have little children three, 
The lessons that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee 
Is, waste not. & c. 
STROLLING ON THE SANDS. 
As sung by EDDY NORWOOD. 
OF course we all know Ramsgate well, 
That spot to thousands dear, 
Where dashing belles and heavy swells, 
Assemble ev'ry year: 
Some like to roam along the Pier, 
And view what that commands, 
But my delight from morn till night, 
Is strolling on the sands. 
CHORUS. 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
Watching all the bathers dip, list'ning to the band, 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
In cool or heat there's nought to beat, a 
stroll upon the sands. 
I'll rle'er forget last summer-time, 
I 
spent a 
fortnight there, 
And made the sweet acquaintance of 
'A lovely lady fair 
She'd gone to bathe at Dumpton Gap, 
But, oh! the naughty queen, 
For once she thought she'd do without 
That vile bathing machine. 
Strolling, & c. 
20 
21 
She placed her clothes noon the beack 
And then in the water played, 
But when she tried to come on shore, 
Oh wasn't she dismayed; 
The tide had turn'd, and all her clothes 
Were floating out to sea, 
She'd nothing but her bathing dress— 
In what a 
plight to be. 
Strolling i&c, 
I 
fetch'd her mother to her aid,. 
And saved all further strife, 
The maiden said, " this great event 
think of all my life." 
We soon became the best of friends 
For all enjoy'd the fun; 
We're lovers now—and soon we two 
Are going to be one. 
Strolling, (tc.

Sung with great success by JOHNNY ROACH. 
Music pub:ished by WHITE S: 
GOULLAUD. Boston, Mass. 
I'VE been thinking of late, I've been thinking, 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries, Old Uncle Sam it's a " poser," 
There's a 
something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our land. 
I'm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sir, 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Mouldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by night and by day; 
While you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your gold to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, sir, 
t2 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, sir, 
And Still you wonder at crime. 
I 
am sure you will own Uncle Sani, sir, 
Temptation is hard to resist, 
Just look at our poor working girl, sir, 
Striving her best to exist; 
•kw.1 
22 
Can you wonder at weak constitutions, 
When blood-sucking firms, barely give, 
Enough to keep off destitution, 
A 
girl, though she's poor, she must live. 
There's our poor needle girl, God defend her, 
With feelings as proud and as tender, 
As your proud city lady, remember. 
Uncle Sam can you wonder at crime. 
Can you wonder at crime can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinning, 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch himf.they say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
He defies a 
whole police division, 
While the poor man is sent off to prison, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
Just think while your drinking your wine, sir, 
How the poor of our land they are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god-send for them to get bread; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
Such sights you will never behold, 
To our prisons then go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoardings of gold. 
A 
little would soon break asunder, 
The chains the poor sufferer is under, 
Go, list to that great voice of hunger, 
And you'll never more wonder at crime. 
MY OLD WIFE, 
MY 
old wife is a 
good old cratur, 
Never was a 
kinder born; 
Never did nothing to make me hate her 
Since the wedding ring she's worn. 
CHORUS. 
And every morning for my breakfast, 
She gives me good toast and roll; 
My old wife's a 
good old cratur, 
My old wife's a 
good old soul. 
Then at night, when work is over, 
She brings my "bacca and my beer; 
So, you see, I 
lives in clover, 
Ain't my wife a 
good old dear ? 
And every morning, &c. 
And when matters run three-corner'd 
She slides up,so droll and kind; 
Gives me a 
buss, and gently whispers, 
"Did 'um vex it? 
Never mind." 
And every morning, &c. 
If, as now and then it happens, 
I 
get beery—even then 
She never says a 
cross word to me, 
But welcomes me with, "Well done, Ben I" 
And every morning, &c. 
Some folks live in better houses, 
Some folks live on daintier cheer; 
But none of them have got such spouses, 
Nor such ‘bacca, nor such beer. 
And every morning, &c. 
Blest with health and my old cratur, 
From all feuds and discord free, 
Um quite convinced, throughout all nature, 
There ain't a 
happier chap than me. 
And every morning, & c.

THE WEEPIN' WILLER. 
DOWN by the country side, 
Lives Old Gray, the miller, 
Down by the side of the mill-stream tide, 
Grows a 
weepin' wilier. 
Under the wilier tree, 
Sat the miller's daughter, 
Singin' a 
song and gazin' long, 
Into the bublin' water— Liquid. 
CHORUS. 
She sat by the side of the bublin' water, 
Under the weepin' wilier tree. 
Tears fell from her eyes, 
Hands she was a 
wringin', 
First she cries, and then she sighs, 
And then commenc'd a 
singin'— 
"All the world's a 
waste, 
Life to me is o-jus, 
Since William he deserted me, 
And went and joined the sojers"—Army. 
She sat, &C. 
Then from her bosom she drew, 
A 
piece of needle cover. 
And on it wrote a 
very short note, 
To her deceitful lover, 
" 
Take this to William Phipps, 
Straight to him be tellin' 
His Susan died thro' suicide— 
P. S.— Please excuse bad spelling— Orthography." 
She sat, &c. 
She look'd at the thimble case, 
Which William false had bought her, 
She look'd to the right, she look'd to the left, 
-•, 
And then look'd into the water; 
Then she did prepare, 
Her mortal life .to injure, 
her head was bare and the color of her hair 
Was a 
sort of delicate ginger—Auburn. 
She sat, &c. 
She looked at the wilier above, 
And said, " I'll hang in my garter, 
But what a 
mistake if the garter break, 
I 
shall be drown'd in the water." 
She look'd at the water below, 
And her nerves began to totter— 
" 
I'm not very bold, and I 
may take cold, 
I'll wait ' till the weather is hotter "—milder 
She sat, die.

WHEN THESE OLD CLOTHES WERE NEW, 
EIGHT years ago, I 
looked a 
swell, sirs, 
With walking cane, and purse as long, 
I 
quizzed the ladies in the street, sirs, 
Alas, that game did not last long, 
I 
married got, to my misfortune, 
From that day every penny flew, 
For soon I 
spent the marriage portion, 
On my wedding-day these clothes were new. 
We went to church, so blythe and merry, 
This hat of mine was new and light, 
We drank our crusted port and sherry, 
And ev'ry eye was beaming bright. 
But you, poor hat, can tell the hist'ry 
Of where we go and what we do, 
But how you stand it is a 
myst'ry— 
Think of the days when you were new. 
And you, poor coat, have got quite seedy, 
I 
never cuffed you, speak the truth, 
You cannot say that I 
was greedy, 
I 
filled your pockets, yes, forsooth; 
For ev'ry morning you I 
studied. 
And after dinner open threw, 
And seldom were you skirts e'er muddied, 
I 
kept a 
trap when you were new, 
if 
1 
And you, poor boots, were bright as any, 
You really were a 
lovely pair, 
Cleaning you've cost many a 
penny, 
I 
took you with me ev' rywhere, 
But farewell to the soles departed— 
For my poor toes they do peep through— 
And you, poor tops, look quite faint-hearted, 
How different now, than you were new. 
And you poor gloves, my hands did shelter, 
Yet still I 
held you in my love, 
We through the world went helter skelter, 
Like true friends, living hand and glove. 
But farewell clothes, we part too soon. 
Then for a 
pauper s 
suit, grey or blue, 
I 
must die in a 
poor-law union, 
In clothes I 
hate, though perhaps quite new.

MOTHER SAYS I 
MUSN'T, 
Take Back the Heart that Thou Gayest, 
TAKE back the heart that thou gayest, 
What is my anguish to thee ? 
Take back the freedom thou cravest, 
Leaving the fetters to me. 
Take back the vows thou hast spoken, 
Fling them aside and be free, 
Smile o'er each pitiful token, 
Leaving the sorrow to me. 
Drink deep of life's fond illusion, 
Gaze on the storm cloud, and flee 
Swiftly thro' strife and confusion, 
Leaving the burden to me. 
Then when at last overtaken, 
Time flings its fetters o'er thee, 
Come, with a 
trust still unshaken, 
Come back a 
captive to me, 
Come back in sadness or sorrow, 
Once more my darling to be, 
Come, as of old, love, to borrow 
Glimpses of sunlight from me. 
Love .0911 resume its dominion, 
Striving no more to be free, 
When on the world's weary pinion 
Flies back my lost love to me. 
A NICE young man I 
once knew well, 
A 
few short years ago, 
He courting came, in hail or rain, 
Ile vowed he loved me so. 
He'd long and sigh with love until 
'Twas time he was away; 
And when he'd ask a 
parting kiss, 
I 
always used to say: 
CHORUS. 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
Oh, George, dear George, 
Not just yet awhile, 
Mother says I 
nmsn't, 
Mother says I 
inusn't, 
Oh, George, dear Geor.gi, 
Not just yet. 
Ile waiting kept, at last one day, 
He thought he'd know his fate, 
And sank upon his knees in quite 
An agonizing state. 
Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we be wed; 
He longed to hear me give reply, 
And this is what I 
said: 
Mother says I 
musn't, 
c. 
From then he went to work, indeed, 
He left no stone unturned; 
Until two thousand dollars a 
year, 
4 
At last he'd really earned. 
My mother heard how things had changed, 
And when we met one day, 
I 
seemed so pleased and so at last 
lovingly did say: 
SPOKEN.—Well, George, darling, as you have unproved in 
circumstances since we last met, suppose you ask me again 
that question, eh, what say Georgie Porgey? 
Think of my 
surprise when he said, ' You're very kind, but 
Mother says I 
musn't, /

PAT O'BRIEN 
31 
PAT O'BRIEN is my name, I'll 
tell you, boys, from where 
came. 
Ould Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy, 
No country is so dear to me as the little isle stands near the 
sea, 
Where all the boys are blithe and free, deny it if you can. 
Ould Ireland is the place where they're famed for fun and mirth, 
Its equal can't be found if you search all o'er the earth: 
Good natured boys and girls are there, with none of them you 
can cornpare, 
Where every heart is free from care, that makes an Irish boy. 
CHORUS, 
Pat O'Brien is my name I'll tell you boys, from where I 
came, 
Ould Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy. 
Dan O'Connell, ould Ireland's friend, he struggled hard for to 
defend, 
'Gainst all invaders who did intend to claim 
Or Paddy's land; 
He advocated Ireland's right with all his main and all his might, 
And he was poorly recompensed for all his toil and pains, 
In high courts of justice he caused them all to stare: 
With his knowledge, wit, and humor, to hear him it was rare; 
Ile always proved poor Paddy's friend when on his trial he did 
attend, 
He caused the noblest back to bend to the honest Irishman. 
Pat O'Brien is my name, & c. 
In eighteen forty-four gone by, out countrymen they had to fly 
For, famine stared in every eye along ould Ireland's shore; 
They to America did sail, leaving their wives and babies to wail; 
They were determined not to fail, but ft eir hardships to endure: 
The harp that once through Tara's Halls, shall strike each cord 
again 
To welcome back those exiles from across the raging main. 
May peace and plenty ever be to our little Isle that stands near 
the sea! 
And all our toasts be: Ireland free! and you'll be happy then. 
THE BOLD IRISH SOLDIER. 
AIR- Girl I 
Left Behind Me. 
A RAW 
recruit, och sure is me, 
I 
enlisted in Philadelphy, 
Field Marshall soon I 
came to be, 
Tip top of tin Union army. 
Oh, what pleasure, and oh what joys, 
'Twill be to gain promotion, 
I've a 
taste for fighting any how, boys 
An' a 
better one for the lotion. 
PATTER. 
Arrah! an' ain't I 
sure, fond of the lotion. 
Look at the bloom 
on the top of my nose. 
Ain't it beautiful. 
But the worst of it 
is. it is always runnin', an' the divil a 
bit can I 
stop it, and 
that's not military, is it, lads I It was a 
rum puncheon ( punch-

I 
should think, that would do it. 
But enough! 
I'll 
leave my nose alone an' go on wid my tale. 
Well afther I 
took 
the bounty I 
started, and got dhrunk to the tune of 
CHORUS. 
With spirits gay I'll march away, 
All danger to be scorning; 
I 
could light all night till the break of day, 
An' come home quite fresh in the morning, 
Now I 
an' another an' a 
good many more, 
Had to strip an' show our figure, 
An' be well examined by Dr. O'Moore, 
Afore we could pull a 
trigger.

Says he, None can be prouder, 
Yez can give an' take some thunderin' whacks, 
An' yer rattlin' stuff for powder.

THE SPADE, 
As originally sung by GitiFF BOWDEN. 
GIVE me the Spade and the man who can use it: 
A 
fig for your lord, and his soft silken hands, 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give hack to the giver— the laud, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neighbor, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHORUS.—Give me the spade, & c. 
Give me the spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak of its praise in ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with gore. 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Created our Commerce, extended our Trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the queen of all weapons—the Spade, boys, the Spade. 
Give me the spade, & c. 
Give me the Spade, there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done, boys, without, 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew cold, 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yelling, 
Where our stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Then Hurrah for our true friend, the Spade, boys, the Spade. 
Give me the spade, &c.

WHO'S FOR SANDYMOUNT, 
SURE ye'cs heard of Dennis Fagan, the pretty colleen's joy; 
And if ye'd wish to know him, bedad ! here stands the boy. 
There's not a 
girl in Dublin town but is by him well-known, 
And don't they seem to like him, for he's kissed the blarney 
stone. 
CHORUS 
" 
Then who's for Sandymount?" I 
cry, 
" 
Sweet spot to view the fair; 
Come, jump up on my outside car 
And I'll very quickly drive you there." 
Loo/c, my horse is full of mettle, bike myself, that's easy seen, 
And my car bike dear ould Ireland, you'll bind is ever green; 
Faith! as a 
driver I'm A 1, no better can ye meet, 
Then all who wish to hire me, my stand is Sackville Street. 
" 
Then who's for Sandymount 2' , &c. 
Sir, threepence is the fare, but your honor has more sense, 
Ye'd not insult poor Pat with less than eighteen pence, 
While you've a 
crown in England, which on royal brow ye fix, 
Your sister Isle will take the half, so make it two-and-six. 
" 
Then who's for Sandymount," &c. 
Then success to Erin's iSle, the swatest spot on earth, 
The haven of all havens, the land that gave me birth, 
And when 1

Old Time hired, and he my fare has paid, 
My only earnest wish is 'neath the Shamrock to be laid_

LARDY DARDY DO. 
All! dear friends, bow d'ye do? hope I 
see you all well, 
If you're game now, my dodge I'll just explain, 
And I 
think you'll agree, when once you've liad.rd what it Is, 
That it's simply no loss—but all gain; 
Don't you see, short of tin and all that sort of thing, 
Very awkward for one it is true, 
But I 
find that the needful is quite amply supplied, 
By what I 
call my Lardy dardy do. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, dear friends, it's the lardy dardy do—very 
prevalent just now—and allow me to call your attention to the 
fact, that 
CLIOREK. 
I'm the lardy dardy swell. 
And I 
don't mind telling:you, 
That the only income I 
possess, 
Is my lardy (lardy do. 
I've a 
wonderful fancy now for all that is good, 
Superfine, and the best that can be had, 
What I 
wish for I 
purchase, _ never asking the price, 
For such meanness ' twould truly be sad; 
As I 
don't mean to pay, it's the very best way, 
Not to ask what I 
don't wish to know, 
For you see Lardy (lardy is no coin of the realm, 
Tho' I 
find it always seems with me to go. 
SPOKEN.—And very seldom misses fire, but it's not to be 
wondered at, for you see— 
I'm the lardy, &e. 
:35 
Wita our fair sex my Lardy dardy do is the go, 
And it seems the sweet darlings to impress, 
I've already the question popp'd to more than four score, 
And my answer has always been " yes!" 
But the worldly Papas, and their cautious Mammas, 
When their daughter's affections I 
woo, 
Always say, when I 
tell them upon what I 
depend, 
You can never live on Lardy dardy do. 
SPOKEN.—IS IliCh is a 
very natural conclusion to arrive at, but 
still the dear girls would gladly share my flte, although 
I'm the lardy, &e.

BILLY JOHNSON'S BALL 
BILLY JOHNSON had been married 
Just a 
twelvemonth and a 
day, 
When he sent his friemis some letters, 
In which he went to say, 
As how about two months since 
A baby had been sent, 
So he'd give a 
ball to celebrate 
The glorious event. 
37 
CHORUS. 
Lar dar de dar, and doodle, doodle, diddle, 
They played upon the fiddle and went up and down the 
middle 
Such jolly boys, and pretty girls enough to please you all, 
A 
reglar brilliant sort of spree, was Billy Johnson's Ball. 
There were the Jone-es-es and the Brown-es-es, 
And the Smith-es-es a 
score, 
The Sprig ,,-ins-es, the Scroggins-es 
And half a 
dozen more; 
In Billy's room there wasn't room 
To dance a 
decent jig, 
So he went and took a 
big one 
At the " Tinder box and Pig." 
SPOKEN :—An efficient band was provided, consiA:ng of a 
fid-
dle, a 
tin whistle and a 
Jew's harp, and they played  
Lar dar de dar, &c. 
They introduced the baby, 
And we kiss'd it twice all round 
Mrs. Johnson was quite overcome 
Fell fainting to the ground; 
But they brought her too with water, 
And a 
drop of something in, 
And when she felt herself again, 
The dancing did begin. 
Lar dar de dar, &c. 
In and out and round about, 
Such a 
Ball was never seen, 
And every now and then, 
We'd a 
drop to drink between, 
Billy Johnson he got dancing, 
With all the girls he'd find, 
Mrs. Johnson she grew jealous, 
And declared he was unkind. 
SroKEN 
make it a 
rule never to interfere in family quar-
rels, so I 
choosed a lovely creature in red and yellow, and we 
glided into the  
Lar dar de dar, (Lc. 
I 
drank love to the Jones-es, 
I 
drank love to the Browns, 
I 
tried to keep on dancing, but, 
'Twas somehow ups and downs, 
To tell you how it ended, 
I 
really am not able, 
For I 
found myself next morning, 
Lying underneath the table. 
SPOICEN :—I 
felt rather confused till a 
friend reminded me that I 
ha,d been doing the  
Lar dar de dar, & c.

LITTLE NELLY RAY. 
I 
LOVE a 
little country queen, a 
village beauty rare, 
With rosy cheeks and pearly teeth, and lovely nut-brown hair; 
Tier waist it is so slender, and her feet they are so small, 
Of all the girls I 
ever loved my Nelly beats them all. 
CHORUS. 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, charming little Nell, 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, pretty little belle; 
Nelly Ray like birds o May, singing all the day, 
I 
never had a 
sweetheart like my charming Nelly Ray. 
Her father keeps a 
farmhouse, in a 
village down in Kent, 
And being on my holidays, to spend them there I 
went; 
And while a 
strolling through the fields, as on my way I 
roamed, 
It's there I 
met my Nelly, as she drove the cattle home. 
Nelly Ray, &c. 
I 
took my Nelly for a 
walk, among the bright green grass, 
And words of love I 
whispered to this young country lass, 
I 
placed my arms around her waist, as I 
sat by her side, 
And while we were a 
talking she pledged to be my bride, 
Nelly Ray, &c. 
And now we've named the happy day, and how happy we 
shall be, 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the minds of her or me; 
But in our farm-house we'll be happy night and day, 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I 
have the brightest 
ray. 
Nelly Ray, &c.

Starry Night for a 
Rarable 
I 
LIKE a 
game at Croquet 
Or bowling on the green, 
I 
like a 
little boating, 
To pull against the stream, 
But of all the games that I 
love best 
To fill me with delight, 
I 
like to take a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
CHORUS. 
A starry night for a 
ramble, 
In a 
flu w'ry dell, 
Through the bush and bramble, 
Kiss and, never tell. 
Talk about your bathing 
Or strolling on the sands 
Or some unseen verandah 
Where gentle zephyr fans, 
Or rolling home in the morning, boys, 
And very nearly tight, 
Could never beat a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
A starry night for a 
ramble, etc. 
I 
like to take my sweetheart 
"Of course you would" said he, 
And softly whisper in her ear 
"How dearly I 
love you," 
And when you picture to yourselves 
The scenes of such delight, 
You'll want to take a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
A starry night for a 
ramble, &c. 
Some will choose a 
velocipede 
And others take a 
drive, 
And some will sit and mope at home 
Half dead and half alive. 
And some will choose a 
steamboat, 
And others even fight, 
But I'll enjoy my ramble 
Upon a 
starry riglit. 
A starry night for a 
ramble, &e.

ERIN, MY COUNTRY, 
OH! ERIN, my country, though strangers may roam 
Thy hills and thy mountains I

Thy lakes and thy valleys no longer I 
see, 
But warmly as ever my heart beats for thee. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! "Cushla :Machree" my heart beats for thee, 
Erin! Erin! my heart beats for thee. 
Long years have passed o'er us since the last time we met, 
But lived I 
a 
thousand I 
could not forget: 
The warm heart that loved me, 
The bright eyes that shone 
Like stars in the heaven of days that are gone. 
Oh! "Cushla Machree," &c. 
Dear home of my youth, I 
shall ne'er see thee more, 
But memory treasures the bright days of 'yore: 
And my heart's latest wish, the last sigh of my breast 
Shall be for thee, dear home, the land of the west. 
Oh I "Cushla Machree,"

THE COBBLER. 
Assung by JouNNY Roam, with great success. 
OCH! my name is Dick Darlin' the cobbler, 
My time I 
served down there in Kent; 
Some say I'm an old fornicator, 
But now I'm resolved to repent. 
For twenty years I'd been a 
rover, 
An' wasted the prime of my life, 
One day I 
resolved to give over, 
And settle myself dcp,vii to a 
wife. 
SPOKEN:—Yes, I 
got married, an' be d 
d 
to me. 
Now, 
upon my sowl, a 
woman is the most obstroperous and outragy-
ous crature on the face of the earth! 
Before I 
was married 
whinever I'd go among 'em they'd be fighting for me; an' when 
I 
married one o' them, in the hopes to be quiet and peaceable, 
 
n 
the day shed beaisy if she wasn't fightin' wid me. 
Now, I'll give ye the contents uv may oath, that before I 
was 
married, there wasn't a 
nicer, quieter, dacenter, bether dispos-
ed, or meeker disposition'd boy than myself; but since I'm mar-
ried, be gob ! if I 
didn t 
get into a 
bit of a 
fight now an' then, 
I'd go mouldy. 
And divil a 
fight iver I 
was in or heard tell of, 
but a 
woman was at the top, the bottom, both sides and in the., 
middle of it. 
; 
My wife she was blinkin' and blearin', 
My wife she was humpy and black, 
The devil all over for swearin', 
And her tongue kept going click clack. 
SPOKEN.—Bad luck to me, if iver I 
could tell how a 
woman's 
tongue is hung at all! 
We all know that a 
luau's tongue is 
hung by one hid, but bad scran to me if I 
don't think that a 
woman's tongue is hung be the middle, an' no sooner one ind 
strikes the upper part of her jaw, but the other ind hits the 
lower, an' there it is, upper an' lower, the whole day peltin', till 
at last I'd hey to give her a 
welt in the gob wid my last to stop 
burl an' thin she'd run out of the cellar, roariu' " Watch! 
_ _ _ 
42 
watch! watch! here's this murderin' villian he's kiln' me ! 
He's give me a 
welt la the gob wid his last, an' he's broke the 
collar bone of me. A—rev, wirrastew ! what'll I 
do ? " 
And 
thin, without waitin' for any on to tell her what to do, she'd 
up with a 
brick and let's drive at me. 
I 
can dodge it aisy 
enough ' cause I' in used to it; but another poor divil there standin 
by, an' not sayin' a 
word to anybody, he got it plump in the 
mug. 
Up collies the police, and walks the three av us off for 
assault and batthery, an' d  
n 
the one got batthered but 
the poor divil who had nothin' to do wid it. 
But thats the way 
of it—evil communications corrupt good manners. 
But now we are parted foriver  
One mornin' before it was light, 
I 
shov'd the old jade in a 
river, 
And cautiously bid her good night! 
My troubles of wedlock bein' over, 
This country I 
thought I 
would try; 
Once more I've become a 
free ;:over, 
'

An' afther I'd bate him, as an Irishman ought to do, the

But maybe I

I

I

You didn't knew how much work you could do,

ANY TINWARE TO MEND. 
Composed and Sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
A IR —
Down Among the Coals. 
GOOD people all give ear to me, I'll tell you who I 
am, 
And if you listen to my song rh amuse ye if I 
can, 
I 
am a 
traveling tinker, as you can plainly see, 
Perhaps there's some one here that has a 
job for me. 
CHORUS. 
Any tinware to mend, any tinware to mend, 
I'm the boy can mend your pans, your pots, your kitties and 
your cans; 
Any tinware to mend, any tinware to mend, 
They call me roving Irish Jack the tinker. 
They told me when I 
left the old dart, it's some time now, of 
course, 
A 
rolling stone where e'er it goes it seldom gathers moss. 
But I 
am one that's not too fast, I 
never go too soon, 
For I 
belong to Butler's club, and keep one eye on silver spoons. 
Any tinware to mend, &c. 
And if a 
pretty girl I 
meet, why the question then I 
pop, 
She is sure to bring her pots and pans the holes for me to stop. 
'And if the mistress does come down to find out what's the 
bother, 
tnever fail to use on her some of the same soft solder. 
Any tinware to mend,_&c.

THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR I 
Or, Where's Rosanna Gone? 
As sung by GEORGE HARRIS. 
0 ONCE I 
was as gay 
As a 
jolly young cock sparrow, 
Who's perch'd upon an apple tree, 
Or down amongst the corn. 
But now clean through my heart 
You could drive a 
large wheel-barrow, 
For my love has left a 
hole it it, 
0 
where's Rosanna 0
-one. 
CHOnus. 
I 
shall never kiss my love again behind the kitchen door, 
I 
shall never squeedge my darling's little finger any more. 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone until it's rather sore. 
! 
where's Rosanna gone. 
I'm sure no other maid 
Could equal my Rosanna. 
Without my love this manly form 
Will soon become a 
wreck r 
Of her Dad I 
was afraid. 
He's a 
disag-reable tanner, 
And he's often promised faithfully 
He'd dislocate my neck. - 
I 
shall never kiss my love, &c. 
45 
Of an evening after tea, 
While her Daddy blew his ' bacca', 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, and 
Ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my! how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden wall, 
AS 
tho' I'd just been shot. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, &c. 
I'd jumped over the wall one night, 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And tho' I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad, the tanner, 
Oh! my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
I 
should never see my love, &c. 
Some say she's hid away. 
Ry her cruel Dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me. 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my gray cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come and frighten her Dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, &c.

OLD BROWN'S DAUGHTER. 
THERE lives an ancient party, 
At the other end of town, 
He keeps a 
little chandler's shop, 
His ancient name is Brown; 
He's got an only daughter, 
Such a 
party I 
ne'er saw, 
By jingo, I 
should like to be 
That old chap's son-in-law. 
Cnouus. 
Old Brown's daughter's a 
proper sort of girl, 
Old Brown's daughter's as fair as any pearl, 
I 
wish I 
was the Lord Mayor. a 
Marquis, or an Ear1,1 
I'm blowed if I 
wouldn't marry old Brown's girl. 
Old Brown now he sells very nearly 
Everything you'd please, 
Treacle, soap, and bundles of wood, 
Lollypops and cheese; 
His (laughter minds the shop, 
It's a 
treat to see her serve, 
I'd like to run away with her, 
But I 
haven't got the nerve. 
Old Brown's daughter, &c. 
Poor old Brown; he's very often, 
Troubled with the gout, 
He " grumbles " in the little parlor 
When he can't get out; 
f'± 
6AgNikk 
tors,k, 112,' 
Then I 
go and make a 
purchase, 
0! and wheu she hands the- 
change, 
That gal makes mefee/ga/-vanize(I, 
I 
feel so very strange. 
.01d Brown's daughter, &c. 
Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly, 
When I 
say a 
tender word, 
But old Brown says that she shall wed 
A 
Marquis or a 
Lord; 
But I 
don't think as ever 
One of them swells I 
shall be, 
But, by jingo ! next election 
I 
shall put up for 
1. P. 
47 
SPOKEN.—I 
shall then get in the House of Commons, which 
is only next door to the Lords. " Who'll vote for Scroggins ? 
Scroggins for Spitalfields ! 
Scroggins for ever 1 
Scroggins the 
workingman's friend ! 
Down with taxes and up with Scrog-
gins! 
Scroggins votes for everything!" I 
think I'd stand a 
chance, anyhow I 
shouldn't he the only muff in the House—and 
then I 
should be the happy owner of—

PERHAPS SHE'S ON THE RAILWAY. 
BEHOLD in me a 
wretched man, quite broken down by 
woe, 
I've lost my wife and cannot find her anywhere I 
go; 
At first she robbed me of my heart and now she's flown 
from me, 
And taken all my furniture, wherever can she be? 
CHORUS. 
Perhaps she's on the railway, with a 
swell so fair,— 
Perhaps she's up in a 
balloon, flying thro' the air; 
Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive, perhaps she's on the sea; 
Perhaps she' -= gone to Brigham Young, a 
Mormonite to be. 
She read so much of liormonites, of nothing else she'd talk, 
And with a 
sanctified young chap each day she used to 
walk; 
She said he was a 
Mormon saint from far across the sea, 
I 
have not seen her for a 
week, wherever can she be ? 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
She can't respect the marriage vows, that faithfully sho 
swore, 
I 
only hope her Mormon spouse has fifty wives or more; 
I 
hope he'll thrash her every night when he comes home 
to tea, 
I 
hope they'll always row and fight wherever they may be. 
Perhaps she's1 & c,. 
I 
hope she'll have a 
lot of hungry, squalling brats to keep, 
I 
hope they'll cry all night, and never let her go to sleep; 
I 
hope her chimneys all may smoke, her lodgers never pay, 
And German bands and organ men annoy her all the day. 
Perhaps she's, & c. 
If she is in the railway train, I 
hope that it will smash, 
If up in a 
balloon, I 
hope she'll fall out with a 
crash; 
If on the road to Salt Lake, then, I 
hope she may get 
drowned, 
Then I 
will get another wife and clnickly I'll be bound. 
Perhaps she's, &c.

JAMSETJHEE. 
As Sung by JOHNNY ROACH 
JUST like Sinbad the Sailor, 
Or Robinson Crusoe— 
I 
left my native land, in search 
Of wonders I 
would go: 
I 
went to be a 
sailor— 
I 
come back, as you see, 
A 
mixture of an Indian, 
A 
Turk and Chimpanzee. 
CHORUS. 
Jamsetjhee, ma jabajehoy, 
Jabbery Dobie Porie, 
Ikey, Pikey, Sikey, Crikey, 
Chillingowullabadorie. 
We'd been to sea a 
fortnight, 
A 
dreadful storm arose: 
Upon an island I 
was threwn, 
To wind and rain exposed, 
By savages sorrounded: 
(It was their island home,) 
They addressed me in a 
language, 
Decidedly their own. 
Jamsetjbee, ma jabajehoy, & c. 
I 
expected from these savages, 
Less pence than kicks and blows, 
They'd a 
funny dress, in fact they'd not 
A 
single stitch of clothes. 
They tore my things from off my back, 
My hair from out the roots, 
They left me with a 
waistcoat, 
A 
hat and pair of boots. 
Jamsetjhee, ma jabajehoy, &c. 
When they'd got all my clothing, 
Thinks I: what next they'll do? 
They brought their paint and painted me, 
With colors red and blue— 
And so that was my costume: 
A 
waistcoat for my clothes 
Striped red and blue, a 
hat and boots, 
And a 
ring stuck through my nose. 
Jamsetjhee, ma jabajehoy, &C. 
For five years in that costume, 
I 
roamed about the land, 
To a 
damsel of the royal blood 
They made me give my hand: 
And there were great rejoicings, 
Upon the wedding day, 
And we've got two pairs of black kids, 
My wife has taught to say: 
Jamsetjhee, ma jabajehoy, &c, 
One day a 
ship appeared in sight, 
I'd scarce believe it true__ 
To reach the ship I 
stole a 
boat, 
And paddled my own canoe. 
But now I'm back in Merrikey, 
The country I 
adore— 
I'll take good care to stick to it— 
And never leave it more. 
Jamsetjhee, ma 
jabajehoy, Jr.t.

THE GOAT. 
NOW my dear friends, I'm going to relate, 
If you pay attention, you've not long to wait; 
My father lived in a 
place called Gramote, 
He had a 
sow, and a 
cow, and a 
fine billy goat. 
This goat, sure, he had a 
queer, curious way, 
he'd go out every morning and stop out all day; 
Whan he'd come home at night, like a 
bull he would roar, 
'Till my father gets up for to open the door. 
One day we it down, and was going to ate, 
The goat leap'd on the table and sthole all the mate; 
And without saying a 
word, shure the dirty ould gommag,h, 
He druv his two horns in me poor fathers stomach. 
Says me mother to me, " Jamsey." " Yis mam," says I, 
" 
Take that goat to the market, and sell him, now thry." 
The words she scarce spoke, when the goat, gave a 
jump, 
And sthruck me mother, oh gorra 
such a 
murthering thump. 
Then all the house bate a 
hasty retrate. 
And the goat backed away at the divil's own rate: 
He spied my father's coat hanging, he gave a 
loud bawl, 
Made a 
charge on the " frize," and druv his head in the walL 
Some time afther they went to look for the goat. 
They searched all around, till they came to the coat. 
All of the goat that was left on the very next day, 
Was only the sthump ot his tail, and it still bucking away.

PANAMA; 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
ONCE I 
was a 
waterman and lived at home at ease, 
But now I 
am ainarrineer and plow the raging seas; 
I 
thought I'd like a 
sea-fareing life to visit lands afar, 
So I 
sailed away from Calico Bay on board the Panama. 
CHORUS. 
Then heave away my hearties we're bound for lands afar, 
As we sailed away from Calico Bay on board the Panama 
Our ship she lay at anchor, in the fam'd Jersey canal, 
She was a 
great and noble ship, describe her now I 
shall; 
Her cabin was on her second deck, through a 
ladder down the 
hole. 
And we were bound for Wigan, me boys, to get a 
big load of 
coal. 
• 
Then heave away, ,Kc. 
Our captain was a 
sturdy man, he stood just six feet three. 
His hair was red, his eyes were ()Teen, and his mouth as big as 
three: 
He could beat the world at drinking grog, you might search 
both near and far. 
And his wife she was first mate, me boys, on board of the Pa-
nama. 
Then heave away, & c. 
We sailed three days before the mast, when the water it got 
short, 
And every hour each man, me boys, he was allowed a 
quart; A 
54 
55 
We were in latitude a 
hundred and one, no land for many a 
mile, 
And all the provisions we had on board was a 
bottle of Castor 
Oil. 
Then heave away, &c. 
We fell in with a 
big sand junk bound for a 
foreign shore, 
It's thunder and sparibles said I, me boys, I'll go to sea no more; 
We had to sail east, west, north and south to keep clear of ships 
in the bay, 
And three years after that, me boys, we landed down Broadway. 
Then heave away, &c. 
Our captain he gave orders for action to clear the deck, 
When the man at the wheel fell through the hole and nearly 
broke his neck; 
I 
holler'd at my messrnates till I 
was black in the face, 
But she turned out to be a 
Chinaman and bound for St Mark's 
Place. 
Then heave away, &c.

THE COT IN THE CORNER. 
OCH hone, wirrastew, how hard is our lot, 
The landlord has turned us out of our cot, 
To us in this world 'twas the happiest spot, 
On the hill-side beyant in the corner; 
The roof was thatched over with bright yellow straw, 
And the walls were as white as the snowflake ag,ra, 
Oh it was a 
fine picture a 
painter might draw, 
From the boreen beyant in the corner. 
It was purty without, it was tidy within, 
On the shelves, shone like silver, our plate made of tin, 
Which cast some reflections when sunlight stole in, 
On the dog and the cat in the corner; 
Of bacon, galore, we had many a 
flitch in, 
The wide-mouthed chimney, that yawned in the kitchen, 
Oh ' twould make your mouth water, and eager to pitch in, 
To the 'lames that hung high in the corner. 
And there by the fire my mother would knit, 
And close to her side my ould father would sit, 
What stories he'd tell when his dudeen was lit, 
While he smoked away in the corner; 
When supper was over the neighbors dropped in, 
And by the turf fire each roasted his shin, 
While the boys and the girls ne'er thought it a 
sin 
For to hug and to kiss in the corner. 
When Jimmy, the piper, walked in on the floor, 
The young people all made a 
rush for the door, 
Dragging Jimmy along to the barn and sure 
They placed him high up in the corner; 
Then at it they went, dear, with hearts light and gay, 
And danced the night hours into the young day, 
'Till Jimmy got drunk an' no longer could play, 
For he lay pipes and all in the corner. 
PUT BY FOR A 
RAINY DAY. 
OFTTIMES the world may laugh and jeer at what I'm going to 
to say, 
That is, provide yourselves, my friends, in case of a 
rainy day; 
For if you don't, when you grow old, on what I 
say depend, 
If you can't help yourself, ' Us hard to find a 
friend. 
CUORUS. 
So now be careful, and be wise, and lik.e:me, stow away, 
A 
little pelf, to protect yourself, in case of a 
rainy day; 
Be not extravagant or mean, have just what you require, 
Be kind and provident to all, it is my heart's desire: 
When I 
see my fellow creature is trodden down with strife, 
To help him on the road is a 
proud time of my life. 
So now be careful, & c. 
" 
Waste not, want not." my motto is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
And this another I'd proscribe: "Touch nothing out of reach ;" 
For " honesty's best policy," so honest people say, 
And just remember, though but small, put up for a 
rainy day. 
So now be caref, Lc. 
A 
pin a 
day, is a 
groat a 
year. which proves that the smallest 
mite 
Put by will soon accumulate, and shows my words are right; 
So persevere when in your youth, and then when old you'll say, 
I 
care not how the world treats me, I 
thought of a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, &C. 
I'm hale, I'm jolly, as you can see, and I 
like my friends to call, 
Though the best of friends I've ever found was my pocket, after 
all; 
For that old friend sticks to me still, through thick and thin I 
say 
If you would be advised by me, put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, &c. 
PA friend in need's a 
friend indeed," but how often when you're 
poor, 
Those friends will pass you one by one, and on you close the door; 
So let your motto be like mine, whate'er the world may say, 
Look out for number one, that is—put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, &c.

JERSEY SAM. 
OH! I 
was born in Jersey, 
And of that I'm going to sing; 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wing. 
I 
went way down to New Orleans; 
And there I 
fought the foe, 
Along with Hickory Jackson, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am one of the olden time, 
And may be thought too gay, 
But I'm Jersey Sam, the Farmer's Man, 
Hurrah! hurrah I 
hurrah! 
I 
bear the name of Samuel, 
Though some, they call me Sam, 
And through this world I 
rove along, 
As happy as I 
can; 
The world, they say, has been improved 
. 
But I 
should like to know, 
If folks are any better now, 
Than Fifty Years ago, 
For I 
am one, & c.-
When I 
was young, then boys were boys, 
And went to bed at ten; 
But now, when they are twelve years old, 
They think that they are men. 
You'll hear them call for rum and beer, 
And smoke cigars heigh-ho! 
What would our parents have thought of that 
Some Fifty Years ago ? 
For I 
am one, &c. 
At midnight, too, one hears young men, 
With husky voices sing, 
That" Champagne Charlie" is their name, 
And they know its no such thing; 
They go to Led with a 
head-ache, 
At least they tell us so, 
I 
never heard of such a 
thing, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one, ite. 
The women of the present time, 
They cannot draw a 
line, 
But wear our hats and jackets, 
And appear quite masculine; 
They wear false hair, for it's the style, 
And call it their own; you know— 
But our girls would scorn to wear a 
wig, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one, cte.

THE IRISH POTATO. 
HOW sweet to the taste is the Irish potato, 
As mmnory awakens the thought of the plant! 
Its dark, verdant vine-top, and beautiful blossom, 
In pleasant transition my memory haunt; 
I 
thought of the root in profusion once growing 
On the broad sunny hill- slope adjoining the mill, 
At the homestead how many we raised there's no knowing, 
For some were but small ones, and few in a 
hill. 
CHORUS. 
The mealy potato, the Irish potato, 
The thin-skinned potato that grew on the hilL 
That delectable plant I'll prize while I'm able, 
For often at noon when return -A from the field, 
I 
found it superior to all on the table— 
The best flavored edible that nature could yield, 
With what eager appetite, sharpened by labor, 
I 
phi d 
knife and fork with a 
hearty good will! 
Alas I 
there are none of the old-fashioned flavor, 
None like the real " SiEUOL1S " that grew on the hill. 
The mealy, Lir,c. 
how prime from the full heapen dish to receive it, 
As, poised on my fork, it ascends to my mouth! 
No appeal to the palate could tempt me to leave it, 
Though allected by rot on a 
long summer's drouth; 
And now far removed from that situation, 
Where I 
uged to partake of the root to my 
fill, 
Fancy fain would revert to my father's plantation, 
And sigh for the " kidney" that grew on the hill. 
The mealy, ttc.

The New

A little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison's, 98 Nassau street, called "The Little Flirt." We 
cannot 
strr that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining "how, when and where to do it," and this little 
volume wonld advise and init tate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little hook, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, caled "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher k: 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the inodus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every mot ion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford rattle innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers.

Theory, Practice, and Etiquette of Dancing, 
With a 
full and easily understood description of all the popular 
BOUND AND SQUARZ DANCES 
OP THE rILESENT TI3f1E. 
This book, containing 380 pages, is designed to supersede the 
use of a dancing master. 
Definitions are given to all the terms 
used in dancing, while the STEPS, PosmoNs and FIGURES are 
illustrated by over 100 engravings, so that the Art of Dancing 
may be included among the accomplishments of all who study 
this book. ( 
Special pains have been taken to present the information in 
such a 
manner as to apply particularly to those ladies and gentle-
men who may be without any knowledge of the first principles of 
dancing, and to those who have always been deterred from resiting 
any efforts on the floor from the fear of presenting an appearance 
of awkwardness. 
By means of this book the elegant accomplishment is placed 
within the reach of all.

wept with her in her sorrows, mud glowed with indignation at the 
wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, an oppor-
tunity is afforded of. 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever 
written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfortunate 
Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultlese, and, her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane awl kind, 
And virtue -warnied her heart. 
But, all! 
the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a 
striking 
example that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the 
end leads only to misery Ernd shame.
