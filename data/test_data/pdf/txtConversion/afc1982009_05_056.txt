Blue Ridge Parkway Folklife Project - 1978 
Field Diary - Thomas A. Mler 
Day 1. September 5. 1978 (Tuesday): Flew to Roanoke, where I was 
met by Carl F. and Charles K. VI. Vie took some time to check a 
local Radio Shack store for some kind of patch-cord or connector 
that Carl was looking for, but in vain. More successful was 
CKW’s foray into an adjacent record store, where he located 
numerous interesting bluegrass and gospel records; he bought some 
of the latter, in fact. We drove to Galax then, stopping at 
Mabry Mill for a brief look, in the interest of seeing what sort 
of public presentation or interpretation is made there of the local 
folk culture. We unanimously found it romanticized and generalized 
in the extreme (the signs and exhibit labels identify the local 
lore, and qualify it as "primitive" but "clever"); likewise, little 
reference is made to any time past the 1930s. The potential for 
a site like Mabry Mill seems so great, so much greater than what is 
now currently realized. Maybe we can help. 
.Anyway, I came to Galax, had dinner with Carl, Charles, and 
Blanton, then returned to the Midtowner, where in short order I 
saw Pat Mullen (whom I have met before, briefly) and met the Ellers, 
Terry, Lyntha, and Andrew, their son. And then, later, Gerry Johnson. 
Vie all got together for a videotape practlcum in my room, administered 
by CF in his unique didactic style.. He not only sets up the 
equipment all the way and runs it a while, but also manages to explain, 
in the course of doing so 1) what you have to know to set it up, 2) 
running it in a technical sense, and 3) using it properly, in a 
2 
field-methodological sense. He manages, amazingly, to do this 
with an infinite patience for dumb questions, which he alwi^s 
fields tactfully and helpfully. I am, obviously, again struck 
by how well-suited Carl is to his current role in the American 
Folkllfe Center. He’s already overworked, but I wish there way 
a way to extend his fieldwork-and-media related knowledge — I mean, 
to encourage his role as a teacher of folklorists, at least in the 
philosophy and technology of field documentation. Ah, well, it’s 
clear I appreciate CF. I also feel good at this point about 
everyone else on this project. They all seem alarmingly capable, 
but mutually helpful and encouraging. The group all listened and 
tried out the stuff with CF, and then we more or less broke up into 
two or three smaller groups or pairs, who exchanged ideas, information, 
and plans for tomorrow. I will be getting up to have breakfast with 
Charles; from there I think I’ll check through the maps of the 
area and then try to get out in the car— who knows where? "The 
Last Picture Show" is playing, but it’s late. 
Day 2. September 6, 1978 (Wednesday): After breakfast, Blanton and 
I went out, to go to Traphill, N.C., in Wilkes Co. Route; 89 to 
the Parkway, then (because the Parkway was temporarily blocked), back 
to 613, south into N.C., then east on 18. Stopped at what 
seemed to be an abandoned farm, which turned out to be inhabited by 
Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Wright (approx. 85 years old) and their son 
Clarence (50ish?). Blanton took some notes, I took pix, all K64, 
to the end of roll 1 and starting roll 2. The Wright farm is on the 
3 
north side of 18, about 1 mile viest of the Parkway. We noticed 
it because of the way in which the outbuildings formed a perfectly 
straight line; evidently this plan was partly a response to the 
immediate topography, for the land drops away quickly on all three 
and promised us the opportunity to photograph them robbing their 
beehives. Their farm consists of about 104 acres, plus another 33 
acres located elsewhere. After leaving there, we went down the 
Parkway to 21, then southeast to Roaring Gap. Then viest on 1100 to 
1101, south into V/ilkes Co., — on 1?49, down to Traphill, and the 
Stone Mt. Craft Shop, managed by Ruth Holbrook. Blanton measured 
several benches while I talked casually viith her. I may want to return 
to measure this place: it is unusual, for it was built as a log 
dormitory for a local seminary college. Route continued: West on 
1002, then northwest onto 1?37. A short viay up 1737 we stopped at 
a curious Georgian-modified I-house, built in 1895 by the Brooks 
family. Iona Brooks, wife of the builder, is alive, though bedridden. 
We could not spend enough time to fully measure the house, but vie 
made some sketches and got a good sense of its organization. With 
the aid of Bridgette A. Smith (age 8, granddaughter of Iona Brooks)

vie measured and noted a small barn (BO’s notes) and an older 
saddlebag-house located behinde the I-house. Photos taken on 
roll 3 Include pie safes in the saddlebag house and Bridgette 
posing with the crib her uncle Bert made for her. The "little 
house" (which Bridgette said was their name for the older, smaller 
saddlebag house had an interrupted sill, which suggested to Blanton 
that it was built in 2 sections; but it's curiously assymetrical 
with respect to the sills. Drawing A, appended. The big house 
was too complicated for us<$ to measure completely, though Blanton 
tried to get an approximate drawing made of the 1st floor and the 
roof system, superimposed. I will return, I hope, another time. 
The address of the Smiths (who live directly across the road from 
these old houses) is: Bert Smith, Rt. 1, Box 14?, Traphill, N.C. 
We then continued on around Stone Mountain Park, circling back 
and eventually returning to Galax via 1100, 21 (north), 1463, 1479, 
the Parkway, and 89. On our way we stopped and picked up Marvin 
Lyon and gave him a ride home, where I was given a brief tour. We also 
stopped to make some photos of the Mountain View Church, and I 
finished out a roll trying to get pix (in low light) of a model 
house located in front of a real house owned by someone named Carlton. 
BO got pix of this one too; maybe his will turn out. 
Day 3. Thursday. September 7, 1978: I used up a good part of the 
day today in getting some things I had needed, notably a watch. 
As a matter of record, "dollar" pocket watches now cost eight dollars. 
Finally, around 11:30 I got out and drove the following route: 
89S to 97* E to 713» N to 683, E to 700S (Odometer reading 11462.3) to 
775* 775E to 683 (11468.1); 683E to 52, continue E on 608 to Parkway, 
rew'ai^ 
0^ <{»A 
CJW.WU U-T15 
5 
E on Parkvray from 608 to Floyd Co, then ?26N to intersect 804; 
804 S, 7993 to Parkway, S to 758, W to 629, W to 628, SW to 638 
(Carroll Co.), 638 S to Laurel Fork, then 58 V/ to Galax. 
As I drove, I tried to look out on the landscape around me, 
to get a preliminary sense of the local architecture. I also 
thought about various ways to note what I was seeing, and began 
by compiling a list of Houses, barns, and fences, as follows: 
Houses 
Central-hall I house 
Bungalow 
Pyramid 
Doublepen 
Saddlebags 
Central Door, Center Chimney, stories 
Georgian 
One story 
Full 
Upright and Wing, 2-story 
Rectangular Cabin 
I also noted the extreme prevalence of shed roofs: 
which appear on: 
1) small storage sheds and privies 
2) small burley-tobacco barns 
3) large storage sheds, barns, and stables 
4) Rural stores 
In categories 3 and 4, there may be a longitudinal doubling of 
a conceptual square module often realized in categories 1 or 2. 
For example, on Carroll Co. 775, 6/10 mile East of Intersection 
775/700, there is an old vacant rural store/gas station; Drawing B. 
appended. Photo: BR8-T.A-3-8> also 5-20398. 
6 
Moreover, I was struck by the range of materials: lots of 
brick, stone, concrete block, as well as log, frame, board & 
batten. Fences: barbed wire, and woven-and-barbed combinations 
predominate, but there are old worm fences and double-post-and 
rail fences as well. A few other specific structures of interest, 
perhaps: (A) An old I-house at Carroll 775* *7^» E of 775/701* 
(B) House on 608, 1 mi. west of 608/631 (at the Parkway), with 
inboard chimneys, different symmetries on different floors: 
(C) A bit farther east of (B) stands a farm with an I-house, one 
end chimney of which was formerly brick above stone, but is now 
concrete block above stone. Good outbuildings, too. 
I also noted barns, sort of: lots of transverse cribs, 
single-cribs, some English. Many are banked, but many are not. 
After driving and looking at buildings all day I came 
back to Galax, had dinner and then about 9500 PM joined 
Blanton and Rusty Marshall for a trip to Kyle Creed’s home, 
on 97 just N of the Parkway. We stayed till nearly eleven, talking 
and playing some music (Blanton on banjo, Kyle on fiddle, and 
Rusty and me on guitars). We played "Sally Ann," "Sally Goodin," 
"Chicken Reel," "Fortune," "John Brown’s Dream," "Arkansas Traveler," 
"Soldier’s Joy," et. alia. Kyle plays fast, but both he and 
Blanton complained of being out-of -practice and unable to keep 
proper time. After admiring a bluegrass-type banjo built by Kyle, 
the three of us returned to the Midtowner, and bed. 
7 
Day 4. Friday. September 8. 1978: Today I combined forces with 
Rusty Marshall and his 4-yr. old son, Sandy. We all had breakfast 
together in Hlllsville, at the Corner Restaurant, and then — after 
checking with Mr. Owen Martin, who runs the Marathon station opposite 
the restaurant — went to the Tasker Martin farm, where we took some 
photos (5-20398) and did some measurements. Rusty did the 2nd floor 
of the house (having done the 1st floor on a previous visit), and 
then he drew and measured the large barn. Meanwhile, I measured up 
the "can house" and drew up a plan of the whole farm. Drawings for 
the can house and farm plan are appended, labelled Drawings Cl, C2, 
C3, and D,E.Since Sandy is so young we did not continue all day, 
but returned to Galax, where I spent the afternoon sneezing and 
wondering why my allergies should be bothering me here, and also 
trying to read some of Peter Bartis* monumental pre-field research 
report. In the evening the Marshalls and I attended the dance at 
Fancy Gap, held at the local school (elementary, I think). We saw 
a large crowri down there, enthusiastically dancing Appalachian-style 
square dances, beginning and ending in a large circle of couples, all 
with linked hands. There is clearly a strong continuity in dance 
around here; the stepping patterns that make up the repertoire of 
old-time flat-foot dancers are at least partially equivalent to those 
used by all the square dancers at Fancy Gap. I didn't dance, and we 
did not stay too late. Rusty and I hope to do some more architectural 
stuff tomorrow.

Day 5. Saturday. September 9. 1978: Rusty and I did go out again 
today, this time to the Ernest Jarvis Farm, a few miles north of 
Sparta, N.C. We first drove into Sparta for breakfast, and then 
went back north on 18 to .Alleghany Co. 1439. At Sievin’s Crossroads, 
a little way up 1439 we stopped and spoke with Mrs. Kemp Jarvis, who 
said her son Ernest was at the farm itself, putting in potatoes. We 
searched for a while when we got there, and finally managed to 
find Ernest Jarvis, who gave us permission to completely measure and 
photograph the place, as long as nothing would be published about it 
in the local papers. We assured him on this point, and then got 
down to work. I took a good many photos, both K64 and JX; (see 
1-20398: 8-20398. Also: BR8-TA-3, BR8-TA-4, BR8-TA-5). Then I 
measured and drew up the "can house"/cellar, made of stone and located 
right in front of the house itself. Rusty meanwhile measured the house, 
while I photographed the old log house, now serving as a barn, 
downhill from and behind the frame house, as well as the adjacent 
cemetery. I began to take a few measurements of the old house, 
which is 26* by 20^’, and in terrible shape. While R. and I 
stood contemplating the complicated window-vents that had been 
built in, one of the logs in the most-decayed corner of the house 
shifted, moving outwards away from the house a foot or more, opening 
up at the corner. Since the barn/house was so obviously rickety, 
we (gingerly) took only a few more measurements and photos, and 
then, in mid-afternoon, departed. We returned to Galax, leaving 
the rest of the work on the Jarvis place for an unspecified future 
time — maybe next week, with the new Park Service interns. Drawings 
appended, of Jarvis "can house": F1 and F2_.

Saturday evening was to be the old-time and bluegrass band contest, 
an annual event at the Beulah Ruritan Club. Chjr^les K. Wolfe and 
Wally McNew (sp.?) and Blanton and I went, along viith all the 
Marshalls. The event itself vias interesting — there was some 
parkinglot picking going on when we arrived, notably by a bluegrass 
band from Mt. Airy ("Dixieland Grass" is the band’s name), and by 
an old-time band centering on the dulcimer playing of Ray Melton. 
Inside, the musicians played first in the auditorium of Beulah School, 
and then, immediately after their performance, would go to the 
school gym and repeat their show for another, smaller, crowd. 
Rusty and Blanton and I Joined in with Kyle Creed and two other 
local musicians to form an old-time band, comprised of one fiddle (Kyle), 
one mandolin (a local guy), one bass (me), and two guitars (Rusty and 
a local) and a banjo (Blanton). We performed some local standards — 
"Fortune", "Fire On The Mountain," and later on, to accompany the 
flat-foot dancing competition, "Sally Ann." And when the show was 
over, lo! and behold! Kyle Creed and the Camp Creek Boys took 
third prize, and made eight-and-a-half dollars apiece in winnings. 
The entire show was taped by CKW, with the aid of Blanton and Wally, 
and I attempted some photos, both 3X and K64. For color film I tried 
something new: Ektachrome Daylight 200, pushed to ASA 400. We’ll see 
if any turn out. Anyway the contest lasted till nearly 11:30, and 
we finally packed up and came back to Galax about 12:30 AM. 
Photos: BR8-TA-6 and 10-20398. 
10 
Day 6. Sunday. September 10. 1978: This morning I went with 
Pat Mullen and Blanton Owen to record and photograph the services 
at a black "progressive" Primitive Baptist Church in Patrick Co., 
near the town of .Ararat. I concentrated on photography and PM and 
BO oversaw the audio recording of the music and sermon and the rest 
of the services. The response to our presence was not surprising: 
curiosity, mostly, and when we were introduced, after the services, 
one speaker mentioned that we had been a slight distraction for the 
congregation. Still, it all went very well, and at the end of the 
services we also photographed everyone shaking hands, visiting with 
one another, and then driving away. I shot a good deal of film, 
both 3X and Ektachrome Professional Tungsten 160, which on the 
advice of Lyntha Eller I exposed at E.I. 800. Photos: Slides in 
holders BR8-TA-7 through BR8-TA-16; Negatives on contact sheets 
4-20398. 6-20398. 7-20398. and 11-20413. 
In the afternoon we returned about 3O0» and I subsequently 
wrote up some photographic notes to myself and then goofed off 
most of the evening, just watching TV and fiddling with my 
currently-assigned Nagra E, which has not been charging properly. 
Day 7. Monday. September 11. 1978: This whole day was spent at 
the Jarvis Farm (Cf. notes for September 9)> with Rusty and 
Lyntha and the two Park Service interns, Richard McCamant and 
'Pfi.vce . 
George Porkn-. When we first arrived, Mr. Jarvis was not around, and 
so vie began with Lyntha administering a photo-praoticum under the 
apple tree, next to Kemp Jarvis’s outdoor forge. She presented us 
11 
with a lucid and helpful gloss on the basics: exposure, time, 
depth of field control, and so on. I don’t know if the interns 
found it genuinely helpful, but I certainly did. .After that, 
Lyntha began to photograph the whole place, and she continued till 
mid-afternoon, when she departed (to get Andrew) with only the 
house interior left to do. Meanwhile I took Richard and George to 
measure the large shed-roof barn at the south end of the Jarvis 
farm. The measuring was their first attempt at recording a building, 
and I found I had to explain it all pretty carefully the first time; 
left on their own, the two would (understandably) miss lots of 
significant features and spend a great deal of time recording 
details that ere of little use to a folklife researcher interested 
in buildings. After working on the barn for a long time we began 
to try something new (for them): a measured plan of the whole farm, 
or at least of the section with buildings on it. I suppose 
I can say that everything actually went fine during these measurements; 
it was just very slow to have to teach it as well as do it. 
Drawings appended are based on the measuring work of the three 
of us: Drawings Gl, G2, H. Photos: BR8-TA-1?, BR8-TA-18; and 
contact sheets 9-20413. 11-20413.

Day 8. Tuesday, September 12, 1978: Today was mostly filled up 
by a tour Into Wilkes, ostensibly so Blanton and I could go back 
to the Brooks-Smith house, mentioned above (Cf. Sept. 6). However, 
we never made it — at least not until too late in the day to stay 
and try for better measurements. We got off late, due to a morning 
meeting of the whole group, and stopped to have lunch on Rt. 18, near 
the Parkway. Turning south, we stopped within about 300 yards and 
spent some time measuring up the Meadow Fork Primitive Baptist 
Church (Drawing I) which is an interesting building. Note the 
different, but equally rigid symmetries of the windows on the two 
sides. At the north end I was able to take a photo into the Inside; 
also took plenty of photos of the exterior and grounds: cemetery, 
pine trees, and privies at the south end. (Photos are on BR8-TA-18 
and 9-20^13). The building has evidently been moved or otherwise 
changed around; the sills were hewn, but resting on a foundation of 
concrete blocks. We spent a while taking photos of gravestones, 
and then headed south again on 18. Not very much farther along we 
spied a sawmill on the left, and went in to ask about the name of 
the church we had just measured; Blanton also talked sawmilling 
with the guys, who may be worth coming back to. We headed on 
down 18 then, E on 1?28, NE on 1730, S onl73? to the Hutchison Farm, 
which Blanton had become aware of previously. He had measured the 
very interesting heavy-frame saltbox house there, but not the 
equally nice transverse-crib log barn, which lies about 125 yards 
southwest of the house, over a small hill. Vie measured it up and 
Blanton took photos; this is an incredibly neat barn, I think, 
because it shows such a thoroughgoing willingness on somebody’s part

to work logs into useful units,and that ingenious hollowed-out log 
trough 1 (Cf. Drawing Jl, J2). After taking the time to record the 
barn, we continued E on 1737 again to Littlestone Mountain Baptist 
Church (located just west of the intersection of 1739 and 1737), 
which seemed to consist of two church buildings, old and new. I 
photographed both of them (BR8-TA-18, BR8-TA-19; 9-20413, 15-20424_) 
while Blanton quibkly measured them up, also taking the time to 
note some interesting pews/benches inside the old building. We 
then went on a bit farther east on 1737 and stopped in at the home 
of Joe Hutchison, who used to run a one-man sawmill but is not 
currently cutting. Ife mentioned a "Don Spicer" who is currently 
logging, and who lived just down the road a short way, but when we 
got there and Blanton checked, it turned out he was asleep; after 
B. spoke to Mrs. Spicer he decided to return another day. We 
then came back to Galax via 1002 E to 21, 21 N to 1467 (in Alleghany 
Co.), 1467 to 1444, N to 18, W to Edmonds, N on 613, N on 607 to 
58, 58 NE into Galax.

Day 9. September 13. 1978 (Wednesday): This was the day on which 
Ernest Jarvis said I could come back to intervievi him, so I did, 
along with Richard McCamant. Lyntha Eiler also came out for part 
of the day, but had to leave to get Andrew at 3-30. Richard and 
I spent the whole day — till about 7*30 In the evening (!) talking 
with Jarvis and recording five tapes worth on one of the Nagra E 
models. This was truly portable tape recording, for we walked 
around the whole farm and discussed various buildings and their 
backgrounds, as well as a lot of other details of family background 
and a lot of EJ's personal reminiscences and memories. I took 
only a couple of pictures, of EJ holding some photographs showing 
his father on horseback and his father (Kemper Jarvis) with a team 
of horses used as draft animals; most of the interesting material 
for today is on tapes. Photos: BR8-TA-19; 15-20424. Tapes: 
BR8-TA-R1 through R5. 
Day 10. Thursday. September- 14, 1978: Today was also a prearranged 
affair: Pat Mullen, George Price and I all drove to Patrick Co., to 
videotape some children playing games at Blue Ridge Elementary, in 
Ararat. I really didn’t pay close enough attention to our route as 
we drove. Rather, I spent my time riding and listening to Pat talk 
a bit about the work he has been doing with the black community around 
Ararat, and at the Clark’s Creek (?) Progressive Primitive Baptist 
Church, where we recorded last Sunday. I had never worked with Pat 
before today, and I find him to be an engaging and stimulating fellow 
fieldworker, from whom I think I will potentially learn a lot. At 
any rate, we got to the school, set up our considerable amount of 
tv gear to make videotapes, and then tried to coax several reticent 
15 
classes of kids to do jump-rope rhymes, clapping games, and some 
songs. Some of them got Into it, as well as into our request for 
flat-foot dancing, but on the whole the clapping games were pale 
and flat compared to the ones videotaped in Georgia, on last year’s 
project. We packed up, had lunch in a hamburger joint made out of 
a regular house trailer, in Ararat, and then rambled home, via 
Orchard Gap. Only a couple of still photos were taken all day 
(BR8-TA-19; 15-20424), and of course the Videotapes. Pat and I 
agreed to go out again together tomorrow, to do Rt. 804, or at 
least begin to see what’s up there. 
Day 11. Friday, September 15. 1978: Pat and I left reasonably 
early today, driving E on 58 to Floyd Co., NE on ?80, then 632, 600, 
758, 602, 799 to Union, where we turned NE again on 727 which took 
us to the south end of 804. In going into Union, we actually went 
about a mile and a half too far north on 799; as we doubled back I 
took the first photos of the day on BR8-TA-19; 15-20424), pictures of 
an A-frame house, just to show some of the modern incursions into 
the vernacular in the area (ITA). As we actually started up 804, we 
began to try to make a mileage chart and note some interesting 
features. Our zero point was the intersection of 804 and 727. My 
notes, with the distances converted from speedometer readings (odometer 
readings?) to net miles from the intersection: 
0.0 Going Northeast

block foundation

also a large house c. 1915-1925. 
1.1 House on W side, with stonework all over, including a 
stone barbecue pit, a table, and a bridge 
1.3 W side, I-house out in a field, converted to barn, and 
stuffed with hay 
1.55 Small board and batten house on east side, belonging to 
Roy V/. and Mallssia Weddle. This was our first real stop of the 
day, and a fruitful one at that. The Weddles had briefly been 
visited before, by the Filers, but really had no idea what we were 
all up to. We introduced ourselves and pretty quickly were able to 
see that the Weddles were receptive to our inquiries, but surprisingly 
naive about the tape recorders. In fact, Mrs. Weddle said "I don’t 
know anything about that" when we mentioned the recorder, and it 
became evident that both of them had never been recorded at all, 
even by relatives. We stayed for a long time, making tapes (BR8-TA-R6 
through R8) and photos of the Weddles, their house and yard, old 
family photos (with ID’s on the backs), and Mr. Weddle’s knives, 
all on BR8-Tfl-19 through 24 and 15-20424, 10-20424, 16-20424. 
The Weddle house was absolutely tiny, by the usual standards 
of Pat and myself.

After spending a 
I roughly measured the

exterior of the V/eddle house. Meanwhile Pat continued to interview 
Mr. and Mrs. Weddfce about such diverse topics as belief in the 
signs, and in the use of the moon to guide planting; hog butchering, 
which Mr. V?. did for many years for his neighbors; and knife-making, 
woodwork, and general farm crafts. Prom the Weddle house, after 
several profitable hours of such talk, we proceeded first to take 
some more photos in the immediate vicinity, i.e., of the fence 
across the road, the corn shocked in a field just northeast of the 
Weddle’s house, and of the Old Weddle home, where Roy W. was born.

Having driven 804 once, we went up 726 to 807, then SE to 
Tuggle's Gap, where we had some lunch, and then back down 804. Prom 
the intersection of 807’snd 726, we also noticed an interesting hoase 
about 3/^ mile E; it was al© a two story Hall and Parlor plan, this 
one accompanied by a log tobacco barn, I think. When we got back to 
the end of 804, we went on a bit farther to the Keith farm, the old 
(5 4s) 
Keith farm, which is located up on a hill near the intersection at 
Union. We spent a while poking around and taking photos (BR8-TA-24, 25; 
18 
and 12-20424) of the house and some chairs, iit one point, Mrs. 
Janet Keith came up to the level area below the old farm and began 
driving a tractor back and forth over a pit silo, compacting the 
chopped silage, which will then be covered with black plastic and 
weighted down with old tires. The Ellers, I believe, had secured 
permission for us to go look at the old Keith place in the first place, 
but, as with the Vfeddles, real contact had yet to be made. Pat 
talked with Janet Keith for a v/hile, and took some notes, which I 
will here reproduce, with parenthetical additions included to make 
summarized points clear: 
Burke's Fork Creek (i.e., the name of the Creek that courses 
down the valley below theold Keith farm) 
Cutting silage; riding tractor and packing it down. 
Mr. and Mrs. Keith - both Floyd Co. High School teachers

the old Keith farm, I made a sketch of the layout of buildings, as 
Then, following the advice of the Keiths, we ended the day with a trip 
up to the top of Buffalo Mountain, which can be reached from the 
south end of 72?. We took photos of each other and of the view, 
on BR8-TA-2^._and of some haystacks on 4-20485T_ then drove home 
to rest up, log tapes, and have dinner and talk to the others.

Day 12. Saturday, September 16, 1978: The morning began vjith 
my making various preparations to leave the field for a couple of 
days. This has all been cleared through with Charles and Rusty, of 
course; my plan is to fly to Milwaukee and back tomorrow, so that 
I can spend a few hours attending the wedding of my wife's sister. 
/ifter packing things up, though;} I decided to first go to an auction, 
near the town of Woolwine, just outside the area (OT/i). In fact, 
this medium sized estate auction was heavily attended by members of 
our team: Blanton, Charles, Terry and Lyntha, and the two interns, 
George and Richard, as well as Pat Mullen and Gerri Johnson. I 
took some photos (BR8-T.A-26 through 28; 4-20485), including a few 
of Roddy Moore, who was there from Ferrum, and with whom I am staying 
tonight. Tomorrow I will do no log; my plan is to leave Ferrum 
at six AM, be in Milwaukee by noon, leave Milwaukee again at six PM, 
get to Roanoke Airport around 11:30 PM, and be back to the Midtowner 
by 1 or 2 in the morning, and ready to go again on Monday morning. 
Day 13. Sunday, September 17. 1978: No log (see above). 
Day 14. Monday. September 18. 1978: I resume this log today only 
as a matter of form; I got no work done due to the difficulties I had 
in getting back from Milwaukee. Due to problems at O'Hare Field, I 
had to spend the night (without luggage!) in Chicago, and only got 
into Roanoke Airport in the middle of the afternoon today. After 
driving back to Galax, I spent the afternoon talking to Blanton 
and Pat, and briefly Charles, and then went to my dinner and an early bed 
21 
Day 15. Tuesday, September 19« 1978: Today — as if to make up 
for the nonproductive time during the last two — was filled up with 
all sorts of interesting things. First thing in the morning, Charles 
and I went out together, driving E on 58 to the Parkway, then 
NE on the Parkway to Rt. 8, and thence south to V/oolwine. My photos 
for the day commence with some shots of CKVf in the car, on BR8-TA-28 
and 4-20485. 
We stopped briefly at a store owned by Ward W. Compton 
(Route 1, Box 119» Floyd, V7\), which is at the top of the hill, 
a few hundred yards south of the Tuggle's Gap store on Rt. 8. We 
talked to Mr. and Mrs. Compton (the former out in the backyard picking 
grapes), took a few photos and got the promise of an interview later 
in the afternoon. Somehow, though, it never happened: when we 
returned, about 12:30, Mrs. C. had gone to Roanoke or thereabouts 
to buy some "market eggs," at wholesale, for the store, and Mr. C. 
seemed somehow reluctant. Another time, perhaps this Thursday. 
Compton did tell us some interesting things in the morning, though. 
He talked about his house-building and carpentry — said he'd built 
"many more" than the 50 or so houses Charles guessed he might have 
made — and told us of travelling to "Indianapolis City" and working 
there for two years, 1911-1913, before returning. There were other 
travels, too: to W. Virginia and Maryland. He built houses in W. Va., 
and also mined coal, which he liked less than building houses. When 
he would run out of work during that time, he would return home to 
build houses. He built the Bunion (sp?) McAlexander place with 
Mr. MacAlexander in 1923, and only said it didn't take the two of them 
22 
"too long." He also said that that house was an example of the 
first type of house built after the era of log buildings, which 
was interesting when the house turned out to be an I-house, equipped 
with a single stone end chimney (see diagram below). Compton did 
not use any special name for house -types, though. 
Ward Compton's rambling continued till 1935» when he put 
all his money into the store, which Mrs. C. called "a prison." 
W.C. is 90 years old. 
iifter leaving the Compton Store in the morning, vie drove 
down the mountain and then E on Patrick Co. 678, to the end of the 
maintained section of that road. We took some photos of the facade 
of the house, which is very plain, 
and vihich seems to my eye to exhibit 
an inexact symmetry. The current 
owners were not home; just dogs. The 
s n ffl 
sign mounted on a large tree in front of the place identifies it 
as "Good Karma Farm." 
We came back down 678 a hundred yards or so and parked the 
car; then after walking across a small field we found the overgrown 
graveyard containing the grave of Ishom Cockrum, with his photo 
attached. We photographed it, as well as each other, then tried 
at the McMexander house once again, and finally took off to locate 
Elmer Lyons, the flute plaHpr/fifer we had heard of. Route: Down 
Rt. 8 into Woolwine, SW on Co. 6l6, right on 619 to the first house 
on the right: Elmer Lyon's. There we took some pictures and CW made 
a short cassette recording. Cf. BR8-Ti\-29; 9-20492. Elmer Lyons 
is old (86), speaks slowly, and seemed to want to talk more about 
23 
blacksmithing than about fifeplaying. We simply made contact viith 
EL so that George Price, the Park Service intern who is especially- 
interested in old military music, can follow our visit up and 
interview Lyons in depth. I think one matter that should be pursued 
is EL's singing: he mentioned "walking around and singing" songs 
like "Ellen Smith", which he also played on the fife. But he could 
never play "Yankee Doodle." 
i\fter visiting EL, we went back up the mountain on Rt. 8 to 
Compton’s store, but, as I have noted, it was no go. So we drove 
home via Hillsvllle, where we stopped in at i\ustin"s Antiques and 
looked for the Shell station I had heard about (which was reputed 
to harbor a veteran instrument-trader), but to no avail. 
We returned to Galax about 2:00 PM, with the intention of 
logging some tapes, but instead I conferred till 4:30 with Charles 
and a reporter who was interested in our project, then went out 
with Blanton, to see a log I-house, or what Blanton called a log 
I-house, anyway. Our route: E on $8 toward Hillsvllle, S on 670, 
then 674 SW to the "Hall house;" the sign out in front read: 
Clifford H. Goad, Rt. 2, Fancy Gap, Va. Blanton took photos, 
mostly, while I measured up the house, producing Drawing K (appended). 
Blanton decided on the basis of the general finishings and trim 
that the house was a "late log housd;" he also felt that the whole 
back was added later, and that seems right to me. I took some 
photos of Clifford Goad’s mailbox, which was based on a small plow. 
(Cf. BR8-TA-30) After a stop at the Snake Creek store, which is 
a really old-time rural store on 674, we returned home, via 674 S to 
682, W to 52, N to 58, V/ to Galax. 
Blanton and I got back about 7s00, and I immediately went 
24 
out again: Lyntha Eller and I went (along with Andrew’s babysitter) 
to see the wrestling match at the Fairview Ruritan Club, some of 
which I taped. I couldn't get it all because for a while we were 
denied permission to photograph or record by the local promoter. 
That finally got straightened out, and we taped the sounds of 
the final bout (BR8-T/\-R9). Then, about 11 PM, home to bed. 
i 
25 
Day 16. Vfednesday, September 20, 1978; 
I'm running late; it’s about 10:30 In the morning and I 
just woke up. Apparently, I'm going to go measure the farm that 
was the Crouse farm; it's now been sold to a man named Church. I'm 
going to be going over there with the interns, and we have to go 
pick up the key first, somewhere over near Air Bellows Gap. 
The new owener turned out to be Mr. Paul Church; he said 
the place was established by Henderson Crouse, who was deeded the 
land in 1856 by the state of North Carolina. Henderson Crouse's grave 
is located in the little cemetery hgh on a hill to the north of the 
old house. He was born in 1835 and died in 1913; in 1905 the land was 
deeded to Elbert and Betty Crouse, and Elbert lived on it till i960. 
There are about 140 acres to the place. Mr. Church said a lot more 
information about the Crouse farm could be obtained from Tom Pruitt, 
who lives nearby. 
Actual location of the Crouse farm: Parkway to Air Bellows 
Gap, then Co. Rt. 1130, which bends around under the Parkway, then 
left on Rt. 1131 to a gate, which Mr. Church unlocked and led us 
through. He left us to do our measuring, and together with the 
interns we measured the house, outbuildings, and grounds; Cf. 
Drawings L1-L8. I took a few photos of the cemetery and of Lyntha 
photographing the house (BR8-TA-30, 31; 9-20492) and some of the 
various buildings. I got back to Galax and panicked when I couldn't 
find the key to Mr. Church’s house (i.e., the Crouse log house); 
I found it before long, however, and will plan to return it first 
thing in the morning.

Day 17. Thursday, September 21, 1978: I drove all the v?ay back 
to Mr Bellows Gap first thing today to return Paul Church’s key 
and a plat-map he had let us see. I told him we would send him 
a picture or two of the house: his address is Rt. 1, Sparta till 
Jan. 1, 1979» then the numbers will change and it’ll be Rt. 4, Sparta. 
I drove on around 1131 to find Tom Pruitt, and had an 
interesting conversation with him. He has few teeth, and so can 
not be well understood on a recording, so I made none, nor did I 
take photos. He said that Henderson Crouse built an even older 
house (i.e., an earlier one) up closer to the Parkway; it's now 
totally gone, even the foundation, the rock having been used to 
build the springhouse that was behind the house we measured, and 
it's all gone. Pruitt also suggested I try to find Harrison Caudle, 
who knows a lot about this area and should be talkative. I started 
to leave, but Tom Pruitt also told me he lived in a"little box house" 
when he was born; he was born in 1904, so he's 74 yrs. old, and he 
also said that Henderson Crouse raised cattle, sheep, ang grain. 
The grain was mostly rye, but also some corn and buckwheat, but rye 
and buckwheat particularly wore out the land. The house that we 
measured, i.e., Elbert Crouse's house, was built by a man named 
Isaac (Ike? Ishom?) Reynolds (Runnels?) — I couldn't understand 
which name is right. More information may be available from 
Melvin Crouse or Sadie or Reed Pool, who are related to the Crouse 
family; I can locate them by asking at the Gulf station in Sparta. 
Mr. Pruitt also talked about house-building himself; he built houses 
for people, who would usually specify the size and the number of rooms 
("32 by 28 and so many rooms"). He described a central-hall I-house 
27 
to me, In effect, as he explained how a house vjould be built. He 
said that was how houses were built before trailers came in; TP seems 
really hostile to the idea of trailers. 
I left Mr. Pruitt and his nephews, who gave me some impossible 
directions to find Harrison Caudle, whom they promised would tell 
me a lot of lies. 
An addendum: Tom Pruitt also said that he felt shed roofs 
were indigenous to the area for a long time, rather than having 
just come in during the Depression. 
I drove on down the hill from Tom Pruitt's on 1131» then 
turned SW on 1193 (this is all .Alleghany Co.), along which I photo¬ 
graphed a shed-roof barn very much like Ernest Jarvis', as well 
as some interesting gates and fences.(BR8-TA-31; 9-20492) 
I thought, as I drove along, about the problem of knowing 
what we should keep track of and document. Obviously, a system 
like I was trying to do the first day, keeping track of everything 
and writing it down is not possible; not every barbed-wire fence 
and so on can be noticed. I can notice things like gates, though, 
that people use a lot, or the fact that even where barbed wire fences 
predominate, the local practice is to build gates out of poles, 
that is, a series of poles which must be individually moved into or 
out of place in the opening in the fence. I don't know, though, if 
that is really the farmer's way of making a gate around here, or if 
it is just used to make a gate that doesn't have to be opened very 
often: an unimportant gate. It's certainly an elegant solution to 
the gate-problem, which uses no hardware at all. 
More thoughts, as I drive along these incredibly twisted 
28 
mountain roads, over rocks and boulders: of the old fence types 
around here, the dominant type has got to be double-post-and-rail. 
I continued to the Parkway on 1143> then 1145 to 18, N on 
18 towards Sparta. For future reference: There is an interesting 
looking (and prosperous looking) farm right where 1143 intersects 
the Parkway, with a big I-house with a full 2-story tee-addition, 
brick chimneys on the main part of the house, at least four small 
outbuildings and a large barn. The name on the mailbox is W.C. 
Woodruff; perhaps Blanton knows about this already. 
I drove up into Laurel Springs and passed through, then 
doubled back to ask about the owner of a large house on a hill, 
Jusy N of town, which had the siding off it. I thus discovered 
The General Store, run by Linda Woody Overwater (husband is Dale 
Overwater). The General Store’s address: Rt. 1, Box 17, Laurel 
(J 
Springs, N.G. 28644, Phone #: 359-2919. The store is filled with 
decoupage posters and similar artificial memorabilia; they also 
sell beer, wine, snacks, ice cream, and a few grocery items. Linda 
was voluble, talkative, and interesting; she said the V/oody family 
has been in this area for a long while, perhaps five or more 
generations, or at least since the eighteenth century. I met her 
father also, who was not quite as talkative at first, but they should 
all be good to talk to further. I made a date to come back and 
do a real interview next Tuesday night (l.e.. Sept. 26) between 
6:30 and ?:00 PM. I took off then, heading up Rt. 18 towards 
Sparta, and thinking over the things I ought to pursue when I 
Interview Linda Woody and her family: family history, local Indians, 
29 
and also tales of buried treasure on their land. LVJO also has 
some interesting views about modern life in Laurel Springs; she 
seems to want more people to move to this area, and is unafraid of 
progress. /\t the same time, she has some real antipathies towards 
modern times, and glories somewhat in living in an "old-fashioned" 
way, and in the fact that old-timers around here were "tougher," 
not "sissies" like modern /city27 people. 
A further note from the General Store: while I was in there, 
I met a beer-truck driver named Billy Spears, who talked a bit about 
Tom Dooley and Laura Poster, whom he said are buried over in Ferguson, 
not too far from here. 
The large house on the hill, which I had originally stopped 
to ask about was the E. L. Wagoner house, which consists of two 
juxtaposed log pens. Just northeast of it, on Rt. 18, is a shed-roof 
barn like Jarvis’s, this one with a wooden silo adjacent. 
Drving NE on 18, I stopped at Joines Bros, store, in 
Whitehead, to ask about Harrison Caudle. When I got out of the 
car, I saw an elderly man sitting in an old chair in front of the 
store. He turned out to be HC, and I very quickly moved some 
equipment into his small board-and-batten house and took some 
photos and taped a short interview: Cf. BR8-Tfl-31; 9-20492. The 
interview was filled with religious stories and interjections of 
Scriptural verse, especially towards the end; I was especially taken 
by HC's explanations of his own powers of prophecy and healing, but 
the tape undoubtedly also captured the sounds of trucks negotiating 
the hill in front of the house. The house itself was very small, 
30 
with a shed roof; its apparent floor plan 
was simple: two rooms of equal or near- 
equal size and a porch with one end en¬ 
closed to create a very small front room 
with its own door — perhaps for storage. 
I was only actually in the first room, which contained HC’s bed, 
a dresser or two, a wood stove, and an old overstuffed chair. I stayed 
till about 4:30 PM, when I (gulp!) ran out of tape, having recorded 
only three reels (BR8-TA-R10 through R12). As I left I took 
photos of HG on the front porch, holding up a newspaper clipping 
from 1916; it is a front page, with a photo-story of the 1916 Flood's 
devastating effects on local residents in general, and on HC and 
his family in particular. My photos of the interior may not come 
out too well; it was quite dark, and I was shooting wide-open and 
at low shutterspeeds. As I left, HC showed me his name written into 
an old Bible; it gave his birthdate as February 12, 1893> but he 
showed me how it had been altered (which it had, not too carefully) 
from 189£» when he says he was really born. He is thus 86 years old. 
Also, his name was spelled "Caudill" in the Bible; he himself explained 
this as the old spelling of it, but the 1916 newspaper account gave 
it as "Caudle" -- the spelling he seems to have used all his life. 
I turned N from Rt. 18 on Alleghany Co. 1415, then N on 
1412 into Grayson Co., Va, where the road becomes 626; 626 N to 
the intersection with 58, then E into Galax. A short way N on 
626 from the state line I saw an interesting house: a thick-walled 
byt frame stack house, with an enormous fireplace. It's owned by a 
man named Cook, who lives back up behind it, on 62? (?)or at least 
on a gravel road. I continued on across the Little River, and home. 
31 
Day 18. September 22. 1978; I got up and going this morning about 
9:30, and after breakfast headed dovm towards the apple-drying that 
is to be taking place at J. 1\. Easter's place, near Low Gap, N.C. 
The plan was for the Eilers and CKW and several others to be dovm 
there videotaping, and since there were so many, I took my time 
about getting there. Vfhen I arrived, everything was in turmoil 
because the videotape gear wasn't working right, they had tried 
everything, and I was their last hope. I didn't know what to make 
of it either, at first, until I saw that all the cables were hooked 
up, including a couple of duplicate function between the videorecorder 
and the monitor. Vfiien we pulled out the extra cord, it worked fine. 
We all spent the morning there, and v/hen I left, most of the others 
remained. I helped a bit with the taping, but mostly spent my time 
taking a few photos of the apple-peeling, of Mr. Easter and his 
banjo, and of the whole house, at least the facade. Most of all 
I spent time sketching and measuring the apple-drying shed; see 
Drawing _M; BR8-Ti\-31; 14-20544. For the sake of reference, 
Easter's farm lies southwest of Low Gap, near the end of Surry Go. 
1411. 
Leaving Easter's farm, I returned to Galax, to drop off some 
of the equipment I had for the use of someone else, then I went out 
again, driving all the way dovm the Parkwayto Rt. 18 in .Alleghany Co., 
at the westernmost end of our area, then north on 113> NE onll53» 
1154, 1163, 1164, and 1135* then SE on Rt. 21 into Sparta. While 
in the vicinity of Brinegar Cabin, on the Parkviay, I took a fevi moments 
to look at the buildings and grounds, taking some photos also of

one of the "Park Service" rail-fence gates, as well as of some 
Parkway scenery. Near the SW end of 1153 and 115^ I saw (but did 
not stop to photograph) a shed-roof half-barn with a shed addition 
attached to it, with the roof of the smaller shed attached at a steeper 
angle; the whole thing was at least slightly striking, and representa¬ 
tive in a way of the importance and ubiquitousness of shed roofs 
IT7L On II63 just NE of the intersection with 1169 I took a photo 
of a very brightly painted house, in color only: (BR8-TA-32). It 
was a two-story one-room deep house, w/ central chimney, surrounded 
by several small outbuildings, again with shed-roofs predominating, 
though there were also gable roofs and one extended-gable smokehouse. 
Another interesting house is located on the S side of II63, just 
E of the intersection with 1168; it was a 2-story house with a wing 
jutting out from the back of the house, at the end opposite the 
large chimney. It looked to be log, as if it was a 2-story rect¬ 
angular log cabin primarily, with an ell-addition. Yet another 
interesting house, at the NE corner of intersectiob of 116? and 1163; 
this one seemed also to be a central-chimney house like an I house. 
From Sparta I continued on up 18 past the Severt’s house, 
vfhere I looked to see if either of the Ellers was around to intro¬ 
duce me, but no one was home. As Idrove along, I was again struck 
by the absolute dominance of shed roofs. In recent years, people 
have really adopted it in a wholesale way; they live in it, make 
barns and stores with it, all manner of small outbuildings, privies, 
etc. The only thing I haven't seen is a shed-roof church. There 
is also a linkage, though I haven't been able to put my finger on it. 
33 
between the shed-roof and certain floorplans. First, of course, 
there is a large barn for hay or tobacco, like the one we measured 
at Jarvis's farm. That form can be subdivided along the long axis 
by a factor of one-third, i.e., the building is often realized as 
a drive-thru adjacent to a single line of stall/cribs, and the 
whole thing covered by a shed roof. Moreover, it can appear even 
withopt the drive, so that there is a line of stalls essentially 
open to the weather. The same subdividing principle can also apply 
to corn cribs: yop can have a third of a double-crib-and-drive, or 
two-thirds, or all of it, and any or all of these under shed roofs. 
Sparta, N.C., by the way, identifies itself on a signboard 
on Rt. 21 as "The Home of Del Reeves." I drove on home via 18, the 
Parkway, and 89 N to Galax, where after a wretched dinner I made 
myself in my room, I relaxed for the evening. 
35 
re-dub using the spare Realistic machine. Around 1 PM we intended 
to leave for the Keiths, but didn't actually start till nearer 2:00. 
We spent the whole rest of the day at the Keiths, mostly making tapes 
(although the Ellers naturally concentrated on photos). Todays 
tapes are BR8-T/\-R19 through BR8-TA-R26; beginning with tape R23, 
the conversations include D.J.'s parents, Mr. and 7Mrs. Dewey Keith, 
and beginning with R25» also include Janet Keith's parent, Mr. and 
Mrs. Freeman Slusher. i\lso to be heard from time to time on the 
tapes are the younger Keith's children David, Jennifer, and Kevin. 
The day's interviews were very successful; I wish we had met the Keiths 
earlier in the project, for they may be not only good informants 
in their own right, but also able to act as "bridges" to others, 
both friends and relatives,vho are good narrators or typical residents. 
Towards the end of the day we made arrangements to return very early 
in the morning to photograph the departure of the kids (who take a 
school bus to Willis Elementary School; we will then follow the 
Keiths to Floyd Co. High School and spend the day there, hopefully 
talking to some students and perhaps telling them a little about our 
project. I will also try to get a look at the old Slusher farm, 
which Janet Keith lived on until the age of three, and about which 
she reminisced at some length on today's tapes. Cassette dubs: R27. 28. 
Day 21. Monday, September 25. 1978: This morning Terry Eiler and 
I got up early and drove over to Floyd, to be joined later at Floyd 
Co. H.S. by Lyntha. We watched the Keith kids depart for school 
and I took a few photos (BR8-Ti\-85: 6-20544). We then followed 
36 
D.J. Keith as he drove to Floyd Co. H.S. i\t the school our day 
was interestingly spent, but not all that profitably; we spoke 
semi-formally to several classes of Mrs. Keith's students, telling 
them about folklore in general and about our project in particular, 
and then trying to elicit some responses from them. I made two 
tapes, or at least part of two tapes; one of these was done in the 
classroom, and seemed (on first consideration) to be not even worth 
keeping, as it was poorly recorded and didn't contain much of interest; 
that ultimately was retained, however, and became BRS-T/l-R^S. The 
other tape was made with the Nagra and a shotgun mike, outdoors, 
and contains the comments and questions of a number of students 
who were on a "smoke break" between classes. All the students 
of this age seemed to be understandably disaffected, filled with 
complaints of the boredom of local life, yet also aware of local 
traditions appropriate to their own group, i.e., stories about 
"the Saddle," which is a notorious parking place/lover's lane up 
on the Parkway, and about the route taken when cruising through 
Floyd on a typical evening, looking for something to do. This 
tape seemed useful even though it too is technically poor, so it 
was numbered right in sequence: BR8-TA-R29. 
We stayed at the school till about 3:00 PM; TE took lots 
of pictures, as did LE, and they both conducted a session with some 
interested photography students who wanted to know more about them. 
I took a couple more pictures after school (BR8-TA-36), and then 
followed Janet Keith to the old Slusher home place. I followed 
her W on 1003 to Floyd, then West on 221 and W on either ?19 or 
721 to the farifc;where we drove down to the actual log house in 
37 
Mrs. Keith’s car. The farmhouse is the one pictured in a framed 
color photo in the Keith’s living room, hanging on the front wall 
near the front door. As v?e looked around, JK talked to me about 
the house in general terms, while I photographed. Somehow I neglected 
to record what she said, but I recall her discussing the outdoor 
milking lot and playing in the lone tree on the hill above the house. 
I took vievjs around the house and details of the briok chimney on 
the main part of the house. \1e then drove over a few hundred yard s 
to a small family cemetery, overgrown with the yucca-like plant 
called "oanetery weed" by some local people. JK there pointed out 
the grave of Jacob Slusher ("Schlosser"), who was born in 1797. 
We drove back to my car then, and I made sure I had the Keith’s 
address, for the record: Rt. 3, Box 19^» Willis, Va. 24380. Janet 
Keith and I then bade each other farewell, and ended up thanking 
each other for taking the time to get to know one another; a nice 
feeling. I drove on back to Galax then, in the late afternoon, 
and spent the evening working on slides and writing some letters. 
Day 22. Tuesday. September 26. 1978: A little after nine this 
morning I got going — stopped by Blue Ridge Office Supply to 
get some paper to try to make rubbings of pie-safe patterns, back 
at the Brooks-Smith house (Cf. Notes for Sep. 6), then drove to 
an appointment, loosely arranged through Gerri Johnson, with 
the Severts. When I got there, GJ was talking to Carrie Severt; 
she Introduced me and then kept talking while I measured up the house. 
It is a large house, with some interesting points relating to its

use and meaning by the Severts. Most important perhaps, is 
the simple fact that they don’t use the front door. Even though 
they live in a house with a rigidly formal facade, they circumvent 
the statement made by that facade. Proof: the porch has a railing 
all around it, and a gate at the center, admitting one first to 
the porch and thence to the front door; but the gate v?as latched 
shut securely, and then tied with a rope. You have to climb 
over this gate to even get onto the porch (see Drawings N1 and N2), 
and when I did so, in order to measure the porch, I furthermore 
found furniture blocking the front door. 
I only took a couple of pictures, since this house was 
being photographed by LE the day I was there, plus its earlier 
coverage by GJ. My photos reveal another of the interestging 
points: the storage cellar built into the foundation under the 
East room of the main I-house part (See BR8-TA-37? 26-205^). 
One more curious point is the absence of any sign of a fireplace 
opening into the E room on the second story; compare this with 
the alternating fireplaces on the two stories of the Brooks-Smith 
house (drawing in BO’s notes). 
After measuring the house, I noticed that Ed Severt had arrived, 
and GJ was preparing to leave, so I began to Interview him. My 
conversation with him also Included Carrie Severt from time to time, 
but most of it centered on ES, his life and stories about floods, 
preachers, and relatives; see BR8-TA-R30 through R35« The last 
four reels I recorded were 5" reels, since I had run out (as has 
almost everyone else on the project) of larger reels. After spending 
39 
a good chunk of the day at Severt’s, I returned to Galax to stock 
up on tape and see that I had everything I could want for use at 
the Woody family Interview, which was scheduled for this evening. 
Unfortunately I couldn’t get anything because no one was around 
and the office was locked and I had loaned my key to one of the 
interns. Clearly this level of organization is crucial in a project 
of this nature, and sometimes I feel as if we have gotten a bit 
out of hand on this one; Too many people are trying to keep too 
many different schedules here for us to effectively be sharing 
equipment, yet there is not quite enough to go around. Anyway, I 
still had some tape in my room, so I left early for my appointment 
to meet Linda Woody Overwater at the General Store in Laurel Springs 
and drove down 18 through Alleghany Co. As I went I took photos 
of some buildings and farms (BR8-TA-37; 26-20544). as well as of 
a wringer-washer mailbox support. I also made a few notes as I went 
concerning the look of the land itself: one is surrounded not only 
by the hills and mountains, but more immediately by the trees and 
plants. There is kudzu, hanging down from embankments and draped 
over wires and hillsides, forming living curtains of green, lush, 
foliage. Then there are the pines, hemlocks, and patches of laurel, 
as well as smaller plants and weeds lining the roads: staghorn sumac, 
for example, and goldenrod. This is all part of the context of this 
part of the country, as is what is now happening to it. The people 
I’ve talked to have sometimes told me about the thousands of acres 
their grandfathers owned, the hundreds of acres they have inherited, 
and the holdings seem to be diminishing: present owners frequently 
40 
carve up their land into half-acre and acre lots, which sometimes 
sell for as much as their grandfathers' thousands of acres. And the 
land is being carved up; new dirt roads are easily built linking 
one old dirt road and another; whole hillsides can be peppered with 
small levelled building sites, or even leveled altogether, to make 
way for trailers and brick "ramblers" and "ranchburgers." 
Driving along Rt. 18, SW through Alleghany Co. I also 
took special note of the way a man herded two cows along through 
an open field, using just a long stick to keep them in line. This 
struck my eye at the time as another small type of pre-industrial 
skill that probably has more to it than it would seem at first glance. 
I bet I would have trouble doing that. 
More plants by the side of the road: thistles, goldenrod, 
grasses of every color from deep blue-green to pale brown wisps of 
volunteer wheat, rye, and oats. Nestled in among these patches are 
occasional little buildings and shed si. near the Severt house, for 
example, there is a small salt-lick shelter, much larger than the 
one at the Jarvis farm, and quite different in construction, and 
just as vernacular. This particular structure had a gabled tin roof, 
but as I have already noted, the shed roof seems somehow characyer- 
istic of at least the later utilitarian construction. As I drove I 
began to pay special attention to the way the single-pitch shed roof 
is aligned, both to the functioning parts of the building, such as 
doors, windows, and drive-thru's, as well as to the slope of the 
land on which the building sits, but it’s hard to tell if there are 
any meaningful patterns here. Again, this might be something to keep 
41 
In mind as I observe the cultural landscape. 1\ principle of roof 
alignment may help in figuring things out here, but there are other 
principles that may apply as well: bilateral symmetry and tri¬ 
partite structure, alignment to the sun’s movement, alignment to 
the slope of the land, Georgian symmetry, the square and a rectanggle 
(Golden Section?) used as repeatable units, and who knows what else? 
Names on the land are interesting and evocative, too, of 
local culture: Just S of Sparta on Rt. 18 I passed "Pull Gospel 
Church Road." 
Coming into Whitehead I notiiced that the kudzu had overgrown 
the "Welcome to Whitehead" sign to such an extent that it could scarcely 
be made out at all. I stopped at Harrison Caudle’s again, out of fears 
that the photos I had taken of him the other day did not Include a 
decent portrait. I took several shots that should be pretty fair, 
including some of HC showing me his winter woodpile, and illustrating 
how he can use the hands and fingers for measuring the length of 
a stick of wood (or anything else). For the record, his address is 
Rt. 4, Sparta, N.Carolina 28695 (Whitehead, N.C.). 
A bit S. of EC’s on Rt. 18 I photographed a two-section 
two pen two-sto£y house; in short, a stack house, next to a stack 
house. Both sections were probably built separately, and the window 
symmetries are all awry. The house is visible from Rt. 18, but I 
think it's actually on Lonnie Edwards Rd. 
I saw but didn't photograph some more houses of familiar 
types, especially I-houses with tee- or ell-additions like the 
Severt house (only not so imposingly sited), and thought more about 
42 
some points mentioned earlier in the day, when I talked with one of 
the guys who is tearing up the asphalt parking lot at the Midtowner 
so that it can be regraded. He was talking about how the pollution 
is worse in the mountains than down in the flatlands; also about the 
bad floods that Galax regularly suffered from till about 20 years 
ago. Before that, Chestnut Creek (which flows through the town) 
meandered a lot; they channelized it and widened the opening under 
the railroad underpass it goes through at the north end of town, 
obviating most future floods, but before that they were frequent. 
V/hen I got to Laurel Springs, I was early for the appointment 
I had set up, so I drove up onto the Parkway briefly and took some 
photos off the westernmost vista overlooking Doughton Park, which 
are on BR8-TA-38 and at the end of 26-20544. 
V/hen I got to the General Store, Linda Woody Overwater met me 
and introduced me to her daughter, Robin. V/e spent a while at the 
store, and I took a series of interiors: BR8-TA-38, 39; 27-20344. 
I then followed LWO to her parents' house; hers and her husband's is 
adjacent. V/e went South from Laurel Springs on 18, then V/ on 
1620, "Moravian Camp Road"; since Laurel Springs is right on the 
edge of our area, it means that I have now crossed OTil. V/e drove 
out along 1620 for about three miles, past a pyramid house (one of the 
few) and then fewer and fewer buildings till we were on a tiny mountain 
road — about three miles in all, from 18. At the V/oody home I 
met the Roy V/oody family: RW, his wife Jeanne, their daughter LWO, 
and another daughter, Cheryl, and made several interesting hours of 
tape and took a few photos: BR8-T^-R36 through R39: photos noted above. 
Then around midnight, home to Galax, and bed.

Day 23. Wednesday. September 27, 1978: I went out today with the 
specific intention of taking: lots of photos of representative arch¬ 
itecture. I left Galax in the morning heading E on 58 to and 
through Hillsville, stopping to take some photos of various signs 
and then at the intersection of 58 and Carroll Co. 703, a complex 
of buildings nestling around a large I-house with 2-story tee. I 
was most interested in the very neatly built drive-thru corn crib 
and the sheds (Cf. BR8-T.A-40: 27-20544) adjacent. In Hillsville I 
stopped at the Shell Service Center and talked with the owner, Carl 
J. Shockley and also to an employee, Ronnie Lyons; they said they 
would try to see if they could get together a group by this evening 
to pick some bluegrass music; if so. I'll record it. Prom Hillsvile 
I continued E to Carroll Co. 6?0, then S. Near the junction of the 
two I photographed a pair of churches built within a stone's throw of 
each other, then went on S on 670. I noticed a suburban sort of 
development (if Hillsville can be said to have suburbs) that Included 
some brick ramblers and ranchburgers, some of which were arranged like 
mini-farms, complete with brick outbuildings for storage, garages, 
or guest-houses. Continuing on down 670 I photographed and other¬ 
wise observed a bunch of buildings old and new: a church with 
a model church on a post in front of it; some I-houses; bungalows, 
a Swiss Chalet; and a bunch of modern houses with gambrel and i\-frame 
roofs. I also spent some time thinking about what Mr. Severt told 
me yesterday about the double doors on churches being essential for 
carrying the corpses in for church funerals; that pattern clearly 
cannot apply to churches which have two separated doors, or even two 
44 
doors close together but with a center post. 
Another pattern for thought: the alignment of houses to 
the road. As I drove down 670, I passed an I-house with tee-addition 
with the tee carefully lined up facing the road and the facade facing 
an open field. Moreover, the door on the tee looked like the main 
entrance, complete with an aluminum screen door bearing the owners' 
initial. 
I stopped to photograph some of the modern houses I vias 
seeing on 670, and got a bunch of them just N of the Parkway; 
Cf. BR8-TA-40; 37-20544. Carroll Co. 670 does not join the Parkway, so 
I backtracked N on it to 640 and then headed E, taking photos of 
a pole-supported shed that seemed to be under construction and noting 
that a doghouse could be Isomorphic with half a drive-thru corncrib. 
I continued going E on 640 till I intersected the Parkway, 
then went NE to 58 and E across Patrick Co. to Patrick Co. 640, 
E to 8, then N to Woolwine. At Woolwine I went E on 40, which 
took me OTA, but I wanted to locate and photograph one of those 
huge houses I had noticed before. Between Little Widgeon and Big 
V/idgeon Creeks on 40 I saw one, which I briefly photographed and 
walked through with the new owners, Morley and Leah Wheeler. The 
house itself was enormous, as my rough sketch (Drawing 0) and 
measurements indicate. The Wheelers told me that the house was 
built in two sections, of which the first comprises the rear tee. 
That old section was reputed to be the second house built in the 
county, but that seems unlikely to me. The old house was built by 
Flemin Dehart, father of Ike Dehart, who built the rest of it around 
|pRf\wiN6 0 
Ike D^twt House

1900-1905. The Deharts ran an early (legal) distillery here, 
producing a brand of whiskey called "Old Ike"; Mr. Wheeler was 
able to show me an original "Old Ike" label, and he indicated that 
at one time the place employed perhaps fifty people. The Wheelers 
saved the house from imminent destruction by Patrick Co. bulldozers 
by agreeing to fix it up and live in it and to allow some sort of 
tours through it. The Wheelers are in fact improving the house, 
and doing a nice job, but not in the least being accurate about 
their restoration; in fact, Mr. Wheeler, who is an artist, is 
painting some fantastic murals on the walls. Structurally the 
house consists of three conceptual units: two 2-story Hall & Parlor 
houses and a central-hall Izhouse, though the entire front and 
both porches (with small enclosed rooms at the ends) were part of 
Ike Dehart’s addition. I promised the Wheelers a few photos, 
which should be sent to them: Morley and Leah Wheeler, Rt. 1, Box 
1?» Woolwine, Va. 24185. 
Leaving the Dehart House, I drove back into the area on 
40, then N on 8 to 678, where I again went out to the Mcillexander 
house/Good Karma Farm, and took some more photos (BR8-TA-41. 42: 
37-20544i,44-20544). this time of not only the facade but also of 
both sides, as well as some more of the sign identifying the place 
as "Good Karma Farm." Mter spending a little while there, I walked 
up into the woods NW of the end of the road; a few hundred yards up 
I saw several buildings that had been mentioned to me by George 
Price: first, a formative saddlebag house, at least part of which 
is log, then a very tiny log house which was filled up with odds and 
ends of cobbler’s tools. The little cabin had been lived in by a 
Miss Minnie Thompson, and I photographed it from several angles, 
and tried without too much success, I’m afraid, to codv an ornamental 
or otherwise incised on the door, just V f/ 
above the keyhole. The little cabin was really tiny, perhaps measuring 
about 12’ by 14’ on the outside walls. After poking around there I 
talked for a while with some backpackers who had tried to climb up 
into the mountains behind these houses (i.e., to the N), but had 
found their way blocked by brambles and thickets of thorn-bearing 
berries. I drove back towards home from there, stopping only in 
Hillsville to check in with the bluegrass musicians at the Shell 
station. Mr. Shockley told me it would be on in the evening, about 
?:30, so I drove on back to Galax for dinner. As I went home, I 
thought about what I had seen during the day, and noted some more 
examples of the principle of similitude between houses and their 
respective outbuildings, e.g., a Swiss chalet-style house with a 
Swiss Chalet-style shed behind it. I had dinner and spoke with 
CKW about the evening’s prospect; he said he’d try to be there for 
at least part of the time, as indeed he was. When I got back to 
Hillsville, most of the musicians had not arrived, but they drifted 
in one at a time, and (with the customary studied reticence of all 
competent bluegrass musicians) finally began to play. The personnel 
included Ronnie ZLyons (mandolin); Lonnie Coles (fiddle); Wendell 
Cockerham (banjo); Bobby Harrison (guitar); and Michael Smith (bass). 
There were also a good many onlookers, including Carl Shockley and 
4? 
various friends, as well as several young girls, daughters of some 
of the fans. The music was all competent, but never outstanding; 
occasionally the girls or a couple of the men broke into a bit of 
flat-foot dancing, but most of the evening was taken up with straight 
music-making. I took a few photos on Kodachrome, but concentrated 
on Tri-X because of the poor fluorescent lighting in the service 
station office: BR8-TA-42. 43 : 44-20544; 40-20544: 38-20544; 42-20544. 
.About 11:15 the whole thing ended, and I packed up and returned to 
the Midtowner for the night. Tapes: BR8-TA-R40 through 43. 
Day 24. Thursday. September 28. 1978: Today was my last real 
day of work here, since I will be packing up tomorrow to leave very 
early on Saturday morning. I began by driving down S on 89 into 
Surry Co., past Low Gap. I got off 89 onto Ramey Creek Road, and 
continued S on Surry Co. 1338. As I drove, I passed a house with 
a sign advertising "Red VJigglers - Night Crawlers", which suddenly 
suggested to me the utility of checking the dialect dictionaries and 
atlases to see what the linguistic boundaries of this region are. 
About a mile to a mile and a half down 1338 on the E side of the road 
I saw and photographed an abandoned car, "The Hillbilly Hauler", 
which was parked underneath one of the frequently-seen homemade 
engine-pulling stands made of two forked poles with a heavy pole 
crosspiece. Cf. BR8-TA-43_;30-20544. I tried a few last exposure 
experiments: the last two frames of Tri-X were shot at f8 @ 1/1000, 
which is the reading I got from the Spectra set on "reflected light." 
All the others are about f8 @ l/500th sec, which was derived by 
48 
estimation based on the Kodachrome camera's meter. 
I drove past a number of simple houses of every sort, 
including at least two 1-level Georgian plan houses with hipped 
roofs, two chimneys projecting just outside the points of the 
hips. These houses are late enough and big enough to have integral 
kitchens, which seemed to me to be an important functional advance in 
vernacular architecture. 
A short way south of Ladonia I stopped and photographed 
and roughly measured the Mays' store, which I thought at first 
might be a shed-roof house, because of the stove-chimneys visible at 
each end. Mrs. Mays seemed a bit timid, but she talked to me 
briefly, and said the store was built around 30 years ago$ Drawing P. 
Not much farther S on 1338 I noticed a striking four-crib 
log barn, so I went on till I came to the first house and asked 
about it. The house I had come to was that of Charles Simmons; 
he was out, but the woman who came to the door ( his wife? daughter?) 
told me that the barn belonged to a man named Joe Isaacs, but she 
didn't know where he lived. Vfith her permission I took some pictures 
of a license-plate-covered shed that was situated out in front of 
the Simmons house, next to the driveway, and then went back up to 
the Joe Isaacs' 4-crib log barn. BR8-Ti\-43. 44; 30-20544; 28-20544. 
I photographed and roughly measured the barn; note the difference 
in the sizes of the drive-thru's; the real one is 10* wide, the 
false one (which is an important step towards the transverse/English 
barn development) only 8*. Drawing: Q. 
Continuing my drive S on 1338, I then went VJ on 1331, then-

S on 1335• ^ little way down 1335 I took a couple quick record 
shots of a small tobacco barn, then continued: SW on 1334 (where 
I took a photo of a gambrel-roofed white barn, perhaps a dairy barn); 
then 1330, S on 1322 to Mountain Park, then W on 1315 to Wilkes Co. 
1920 and a short piece S to Rt. 21. I went V/ in Wilkes on Rt. 21, 
then W on 1002 to Dockery, N on 1736 to Absher, and E on 1?37 till 
I got back to the Brooks-Smith house, where Blanton and I had 
been on Sept. 6. I tried then to do some rubbings of the patterns 
on the pie safes which were located in the little house, but my 
efforts were a dismal failure: none of the rubbings was good enough 
to keep, as none of them offered any interpreti-ve advantage over a 
good photo, or even a fair photo, which I had already taken. I also 
got Bert Smith's phone number (957-8211) so that I can call him 
this evening to see if he might want to sell one of his pie-safes. 
Continuing on, I went E on 1737* N around Stone Mt. on 1749, then 
up 21 to the Parkway, to 89 and back to Galax. In Galax I tried to 
check out the possibility for sending home a pie safe in case I 
should try to buy one, and found that it's not really possible, at 
least not at any reasonable price. So instead of worrying about 
a potentially unethical purchase, I hooked up with Carl Fleischhauer 
and we drove over to Ployd Co,, to the Keith's home, where we recorded 
the Korn Kutters live, on Tapes BR8-TA-R44 through R47. The band 
performs almost exclusively instrumental music, and with a good deal 
of vigor and precision. Carl took photos as I did the recording, 
and it was a very pleasant evening spent among people we have gotten 
to know and like.

Day 25. Friday, September 29, 1978: 'This day was spent packing 
things up generally. Almost all of us were constantly around 
the Midtowner, and I spent the morning making dubs of some of the 
tapes so that I could give the originals to Charles Wolfe and keep 
copies. I also began by making a cassette copy of last night’s 
Korn Kutters tapes for the Keiths. In the afternoon I packed up 
most of my own stuff, and spent the evening till about ten casually 
(but constantly!) helping CP and the others pack up our substantial 
office. 
Day 26. Saturday, September 30, 1978: I left Galax this morning 
about 5*30 and drove one of the government cars to Washington, 
leaving it at the Library of Congress for CP to take care of. 
Then it was off to the airport, an amazingly quick flight home, 
and the fieldwork phase of the project was over. 
Dear Carl, 
Sorry about the lack of a speedy response on this, but with 
moving and getting my teaching shit together I've been busier than 
a one-legged man at an ass-kicking contest. 
Comments on the mockup of the Ernest Jarvis section: 
Section 1\, p. 3 — Sentence beginning "The site also 
locates..." seems very awkward. After all, the site involves a 
big hill; the human response to the site was to locate buildings 
below the crest and (as much as possible) along a level. 
Section D — Wight it be helpful to substitute the local 
name "can house" for one of your mentions of the "cellar?" 
Other than these tiny quibbles, it all looks great. 
Oh, yes,: Linguam Latinam non amo. 
Will do my best to get an essay written in the coming month. 
Will I see any of youse guys in L.A. fbr the APS meeting? Hope so.
