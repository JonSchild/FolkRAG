Briana O’Higgins interviewing Dick Ziegler November 3, 2012 
 
Ok, will you start with your name and what you did at Boeing? 
 
Richard L. Ziegler, I go by Dick and I was the senior manager of media relations, 
public relations and media relations for the company. I also was the customer 
service.. well I should say customer service guy, and I was also the director for the 
rebuilding of the B29 Doc.  
 
Um, are you from Wichita? 
 
No, don’t have that pleasure, but I was born back east, upstate New York.  
 
Um, when did you first know of Boeing? Were you younger…? 
 
Yeah, when the headhunter called me and said, Hey, have I got a deal for you, 
hahaha. I was actually working, I had retired from the military, and I was working as 
a loan officer for a bank at a federal credit union, one of their departments, and was 
looking for a job. And I went to work for Manning, Selvedge and Lee, public relations 
international PR in Washington D.C. And I was an independent contributor at that 
time, and that just translates into ‘don’t make much money’ so… I got a call one day 
from a head hunter and he said what do you think about the Boeing company. I said 
Yes, I have flown their airplanes for years, he said will you fly out to Wichita and 
interview for a job and I said absolutely. Three weeks later I was in Wichita. 
 
So Boeing is the only reason you live in Wichita? 
 
Yeah, that and my wife. That’s about right.  
 
It sounds like Boeing wasn’t your first job, where did you work leading up to that? 
 
Well, I was career military, um, both commissioned and enlisted. I got out of the Air 
Force and again went as an independent contributor both at the credit union and a 
public relations firm, and then I worked for Boeing, and that was it. 
 
Um, do you have family members who worked for Boeing? 
 
No. 
 
Just you. OK, so you talked about how you got recruited… 
 
Well, I don’t know. My stepson interviewed at Boeing, I don’t know whether he is 
going to get a job there or not, but, you know, but to my knowledge no I don’t. 
 
What was, you told me your job title, so on from there, what were your job 
responsibilities at Boeing? What did you do day to day? 
 
Uh, oh my goodness, day to day I was responsible for handling news media queries 
for local, uh, regional, national and international media. I also was responsible for 
customer satisfaction… when I say costumer satisfaction they have a whole bunch of 
people in Seattle and other places who look after the airline buying public. Airline 
customers. I just handled basic customer service. And from the year 1997 until I left 
Boeing, I was also the project director for the reconstruction of the B29 Doc. I 
brought Doc to town and assembled the volunteers, and wrote the plan and away 
we went, uh, we have rebuilt it now to where we only need a few more things to 
make it fly. 
 
Was that a Boeing sponsored project? 
 
Uh, Boeing, Boeing said we will give you the time to do it, we will give you a place to 
put the airplane, your labor has to be volunteer and we will give you X number of 
dollars, but after that we are going to have to turn off the tap. So that is how it went. 
So we managed it, contributions, donations. And a bunch of really, really great 
people. Businesses and everything in Wichita and other places that donated original 
pieces and parts, old B29ers that still had pieces and parts, and uh, it was just great. 
I had a wonderful time on that airplane.  
 
Um, what years were you employed at Boeing? 
 
I went to work for Boeing in 1989 and left in 2005.  
 
Uh, well this seems like a jump, but I will go ahead anyway. What were the periods 
of strike like when you were at Boeing? When the unions were on strike. 
 
I have kind of a different take on union company relations. Um, they were stressful; I 
can’t deny that they were stressful. Um, the guys out on the line, the picket line were 
giving an awful lot to get what they seemed to want with their contract. 
Management was put under stress and strain trying to cope with the fact that they 
didn’t have a complete workforce but for me, my job really didn’t change all that 
much. I still fielded media queries, I still answered media queries as best I could, all 
during the strikes and unless you can put a different complexion on the question 
that is about all I can say about it. 
 
What were your superiors like and what sort of were your guidelines for doing your 
job especially when answering news media queries? How much filter was there, 
how open were you allowed to be? 
 
It was my personal position, has been ever since I began doing the job back in the 
United States Air Force in 1972 when I became an officer and a PAO, public affairs 
officer, it was my job to deal absolutely truthfully with news media. I would always 
tell a news media representative, listen I will tell you what you want to know, there 
are only two things that I will not do: I will not lie and if I can’t tell you something, I 
will tell you that I can’t tell you something. And you can ask the question any way 
you want and you still wont get an answer. Was there a filter? Sure, absolutely. 
There always is a filter when you have corporate people involved. They like to write 
the rules at headquarters and let you interpret them… and interpret them for you. 
And if you have questions about it, it goes up the flagpole and if it comes back 
approved you go ahead and say what you need to say. But I tried to always work in 
an atmosphere of complete disclosure and truth as much as I could.  
 
And did you feel like you were being restrained unnecessarily ever, or … 
 
Absolutely. Absolutely. There were a lot of things in my professional opinion that I 
should have been able to relate, but for either reasons of…. Uh, well let me rephrase 
that. Either the lawyers said don’t do it, OK, which was a lot of the time. Or, 
headquarters said don’t do it, and as you know, they weren’t in business to make 
airplanes; they were in business to make money. Airplanes were the way that they 
made money. And of course they had their stockholders to concern themselves with 
and issued their opinions about what I could say based what’s best for the company 
vis a vis the stock holders. As it should be, I guess. 
 
Did you get any feedback about what headquarters thought about media coverage of 
Boeing in Wichita? 
 
Yeah, I think the feedback that I personally got was very positive. Um, and I am 
going toot my own horn here for a second. I came on board in 1989. Before that 
Boeing had a, Boeing had an air of mystery about it. If it was inside the fence, it 
stayed there. It was mysterious. When I first got there I made it my rule and my 
personal obligation to meet with each representative from each of the major media, 
let um, you know, meet with them. And not only meet with them once but meet with 
them regularly. And let them know that there was no mystery. So. Did I even answer 
that question? 
 
Yeah. How did the news media, how did you feel the news media felt about you and 
about Boeing? 
 
I could take you upstairs and show you on my email some of the mail that I got when 
they found that I was leaving Boeing. Um, I think my reputation was a good one. I 
think I was… of course you have always got folks that wish you could’ve told them 
more. And I only got in one argument with one news media representative in the 
years that I worked for Boeing. And he is now not only my friend, but my financial 
advisor, so we buried the hatchet HA, HA, and away we go…. No, I had a good rep 
and I hope it was well earned. 
 
What, yup… (Video guy does something). What sort of corporate changes or um, any 
sort of internal changes did you go through in your tenure there? 
 
There was a big change. As I mentioned before we started the interview, I was hired 
by Boeing military airplanes group, Boeing Military Airplanes. And that is the thing 
for which the Wichita division was known. Military airplanes since 1940 something 
uh, but they also built 75 percent of all commercial airliners that Boeing builds, so 
there was a huge commercial component here. It changed within the couple of years 
that I went to work for Boeing, from Boeing Military Airplanes to Boeing 
Commercial Airplanes, Wichita Division. Boeing Military Airplanes retained a 
division here, the same division that has now indicated they are to leave. And then 
the commercial division, which has turned into Spirit Aerosystems now. Big, big 
changes. And of course, we also underwent changes in leadership uh, hahahaha. 
Yeah. Changes in leadership both locally, and at the headquarters level. 
 
What were those changes like? 
 
Oh CEOs, high, I can’t related any specific changes that went on. But you could tell 
that the complexion of the Boeing Company changed when the CEO changed. It was 
like Mr. Allen Mulally. Allen is CEO of Ford Motor Company now. Allan was my boss, 
my boss’ boss’ boss. For commercial airplanes. Allen is a terrific leader, but you 
could tell when Allen came on and the last guy left. Suddenly.. (Coughing) Suddenly 
you see different communications start to flow down from Seattle. This is before the 
move to Chicago. Um, you could see things, in some ways, getting a little tighter in 
the building of the airplanes, and freer in the talking about it. So, yeah, it was a 
different complexion. As I think there always is when there is a change of leadership.  
 
What was the culture like in your workplace? 
 
It was smoke and mirrors. No, it was… that… that would depend on where you 
worked. That would depend on exactly where you worked, how much overtime you 
were required to work, who your boss was. Uh, the patterns of stress would change 
with every shop. I mean you could tell when things were tense. You could tell when 
we were behind on orders, you could tell after layoffs were announced. I worked for 
a gentleman who was a politician, he was a lawyer by trade, as far as I know he had 
never practiced law. But he was skilled at the law and schooled in the law. Uh, he 
liked to dabble in my job, and that created a lot of stress for me. So… 
 
Did you hang out with Boeing people? Did they become your friends at all; did you 
hang out after work? 
 
HAHAHAHA. That… among the things that I recall at Boeing I remember a particular 
conversation that I had when one of the people that reported to me complained 
about my to my boss. And my boss, as was his want, got me outside in the back 
during a smoke break, that is back when I smoked, I don’t anymore. And he said you 
know, you really have to start to learn to get along with these people, you have to go 
along to get along. And I said, you know, I didn’t join this company to take warm 
showers with my colleagues. I don’t work for you, I don’t work for them. I work for 
the Boeing Company. Ooooo. Big mistake. And that was the day that I felt the stress 
start, and it didn’t stop until I left. Same guy. So, did that even answer your question? 
 
Yeah. Um, so you didn’t hang out with your employees? 
 
OH, I’m sorry. No I didn’t. Uh… 
 
But it sounds like you were sort of in charge of a department so you didn’t have a lot 
of contemporaries. 
 
I didn’t believe in a company with everyday with every night. No, I don’t do that. I 
have good friends who are former Boeing employees and Boeing employees now, 
uh, or actually more appropriately Spirit employees now. But, no, I didn’t hang out 
with people like that. 
 
What was your and is your impression of Boeing as a contributor to the Wichita 
community? 
 
Oh, I think you’ve heard the expression, I’m sure you’ve heard the expression, if you 
haven’t let me make you aware of it: when Boeing sneezes Wichita catches cold. 
That was pretty much then when we had 24,200 people on the payroll. That’s a 
huge, huge impact on the local community. And I’ve got to say, to its credit, Boeing 
turned loose with the bucks. They did. They were a good corporate citizen. They 
tried to be as good a corporate citizen as they possibly could within the framework 
of budget and stockholders. So, yeah, they did, they did, and I haven’t kept track of 
whether they are still doing, but they did a lot of good for food bank, Red Cross, 
United Way, um, they treated the town well, I think. And the town, in turn, treated 
them well with favorable tax; you know favorable tax structures and things like that, 
so. 
 
How did they treat their employees? 
 
How did who treat their employees? 
 
Boeing. 
 
You want a single answer that would take more than the time that we have to 
answer. Uh…. Again, it all depends on the shop you worked in, and what your job 
was. I found it to be a stressful environment, I did. There were a lot of folks who 
found it to be a stressful environment. There were a lot of complaints, there were a 
lot of uh, morale problems. Up and down, up and down… as the contract went, so 
went the ebb and flow of the morale. But in general, I guess Boeing treated its 
employees fairly well. Oh, and it all depends on if you were a commercial or military 
employee too.  
 
Tell me more about that. 
 
Well military employees there never have been as many military employees as there 
are, when I say that I mean Boeing Military Airplanes, as there have commercial 
airplanes. Back when they were building airplanes, I can’t talk to because that was 
before my time. But when they were modifying… and they are absolutely wonderful 
modifiers of current airplanes– they treated their people a little differently, they 
were a little harsher then the commercial guys were. Because there was more of a 
tendency to stick to the old ways with Boeing Military Airplanes. They days of 
Theory X and Theory Y, the Theory X manager, a lot of Theory X management when 
I came to work for Boeing Military Airplanes… Theory X, authoritarian, do as I say, 
get it done, get after it, you know, that kind of stuff. And again, my impression only. 
 
Sure, as all of this really will be. What was your impression… not your impression, 
what was your interaction with Seattle, and what was Boeing Wichita’s, as a whole, 
interaction with Seattle? 
 
Who? Mother Boeing? HAHAHAHA. That is an answer to the question right there. 
Uh, I, there was a time when I was going to Boeing four, five and six times a year to 
meet with my corporate fathers, and mothers. Uh, if Seattle said do it, it got done. Let 
me kind of modify this statement a little bit. Wichita had then, and had all the way 
up until the time I left, had a very, very good reputation in Seattle for putting out 
quality work, on time, within budget, without a lot of crap in the mix, if you know 
what I mean. Uh, and they treated Wichita, singularly a little better then other 
places. Interaction, naw, personal interaction, I talked to Seattle everyday. If I didn’t 
they would talk to me, haha, so. Six of one, half dozen of the other.  
 
(Film guy: as a follow up on that, how did you specifically get on with the PR people 
in Seattle?) 
 
Good question. This is an astute question. Uh, there were no lack of folks in Seattle 
who thought they did more than all the other PR people in the world. And it was the 
gospel according to Boeing. I met people… I met people, HAHAHA, yes I did…. 
Hahaha. Who thought they knew a lot more then they really did. And, they were … 
um, haughty about it. A little haughty. They let you know that they worked in Seattle 
and you didn’t. Is that kind of where we were going? 
 
Was that better than working in Wichita? Did they just think that you would have 
rather had a position there? 
 
Well, no. You have heard the, you’ve heard the expression, ‘Not invented here.’ If it 
wasn’t invented in Seattle, it wasn’t worth a darn. If it wasn’t their policy then it had 
absolutely no impact at all. Individually and as a corporate body they thought that 
they knew more than we did.  
 
(Film Guy: Was that because they looked down at you because you were out in the 
provinces?) 
 
I think that is what haughty means. 
 
Did you feel a sense of loyalty to Boeing at any time? 
 
I felt a sense of loyalty to the company, absolutely. I wouldn’t, I couldn’t keep a job 
for a boss that I didn’t feel like I could be loyal to. That would be two faced. Um, 
there were times that I disagreed with them, and I told them that I disagreed with 
them, and if they said this is how it is, make it so. I would say ay ay captain and 
march on and make it so. But I was always, if not anything else in this world, I was 
always loyal to my company and to my boss. No matter how I was treated. 
 
Were they loyal to you? 
 
No. No…. …. They were a little two faced. A little two faced. A little two faced? My 
aunt fannie, they were a lot two faced. Ohhh, yeah. Next question. 
 
What was your exit like, and what were the last years like? 
 
There was always… when I went to work for Boeing in 89 there were rumors. Oh 
this is going to happen, or that is going to happen. Throughout the 1990s,  
 
(Phone ringing, time lapse.) 
 
Yeah, ok, since you’ve asked me that, it is time for storytelling. 
 
Good. 
 
Ah, at Boeing, I got promoted to positions of increasingly more responsibility, up to 
a point I was two steps down you might as well say from reporting to the Vice 
President of the division. There were three females uh, and towards the last there, 
I’ll give you three females and three males. One by one the males went and did other 
things, and I was pretty much the only manager, male manager left. The rest of them 
were female, and all of them at one time or another reported to me. So, I applied to 
my boss… we had this performance management plan that we had to do every year. 
You had to say how you think you were doing and how you are going to make it 
better. How you were going to make it better. And what your ambitions and 
aspirations were. So, I would every year (phone ringing) ask the director…. My wife 
must be asleep, excuse me. Anyway, every year on my performance management 
plan on the back page where it says ‘what do you want to do now,’ I would put ‘I 
want to be in line for a senior leadership position… school, training. I want to go to 
school in St. Louis, Chicago, wherever it was and be trained to be a senior level 
executive, instead of just a midlevel executive. I asked that four years in a row. In the 
fifth year I took my boss to task for it. I said why won’t you let me go to school. He 
said, it ain’t ever going to happen. And I said, well you mind telling me why? He says 
sure, you’re too old. And I looked him right in the eye and I told him, that’s the 
wrong thing to tell me. That is the wrong thing to say, number one, it is against the 
law. And number two, its just wrong. You shouldn’t do that. He said well, I will tell 
you what. I am telling you again, you’re too old for senior leadership training and if 
you ever ask me in a court of law, I will call you a lair. If you ever accuse me in a 
court of law I will call you a lair. Well, there was a particular female individual who 
at the time was reporting to me who was now close to being a vice president, 
because she got preferential treatment, she got the senior leadership school. She got 
the senior management training, she got the opportunities, and I got underneath the 
bus. Hahaha, in 2005. I will go to my grave believing it was because I was over 60 
years old.  There is no way you could convince me of it being any other way. From 
the time of my, that I related to you that I told my boss I didn’t take warm showers 
with my colleagues, my life was… not a living hell. I don’t want to paint it theatrically 
and call it a living hell, but it was always filled with a little bit of stress. There was 
always that little bit of stress, that little bit of not knowing. They kept me, and I am 
going to again– roses in my hair– they kept me because I was very good at what I 
did. I had a very good reputation and I was very loyal to the company. But when 
they decided that they were going to sell the company I was alright to handle the 
queries about alright, are you selling the company? But when it came time to say, 
yeah we are selling the company they took it away from me and gave it to somebody 
else. The handwriting was on the wall. So, my last year at Boeing, and besides I lost 
my wife 30 days before they essential terminated me, the let me go under 
permanent release. I just didn’t think that was the way to do it. I was a victim of the 
ring and run… club. The overnight delivery guy who would toss you the package. 
Ring your door and take off like hell, because that was your layoff notice. 
 
Will you tell me about that day? How it came, in the mail? What day was it? 
 
It was a Saturday; it didn’t come in the mail. I kind of anticipated it. I shouldn’t have, 
but I kind of anticipated that I wasn’t going to be kept on. Now they had two or three 
different ways that they could have kept me. I will explain that to you, if you want to 
hear it. But Saturday morning I woke up, again, as I told you, I had lost my wife in 
April and this was May. I heard the doorbell, ran outside because I knew what was 
going to happen. After all, I was in on some of the planning of it. Ran outside saw 
this, this truck driving away and saw this package on my step and I knew what it 
said even before I opened it…. Thank you for your 16 years, we don’t need you 
anymore.  
 
Did you go to work that Monday?  
 
Nobody did, nobody that got one of those, those packages in the mail went. Friday 
was the last day.  
 
So, like Thursday, Wednesday, Thursday Friday you were preparing media 
packages, because you knew that the company was going to do a large layoff, and 
Saturday you were one of them. 
 
Yeah, well it wasn’t quite, it was a month or so before the layoff notices came down 
that they jerked me off the project. Uh, I even worked with the company that Boeing 
had hired to place this thing into effect. The venture capitalists that bought Boeing, 
that bought Boeing Commercial Airplane Group Wichita Division, I met their guys, I 
worked with them side by side, until about a month before the big ball went up and 
all of the sudden I was told I wasn’t welcome to do that anymore. So that is kind of 
how you know what’s going on. 
 
What was that Monday like for you? 
 
You mean the Monday after the Friday that was my last? 
 
Well I was just devastated. I had never been fired or laid off before in my life. I will 
be 70 years old in another couple of years, and I had never been laid off or fired 
from a job. To me that was just unacceptable. And it took it as a personal slap in the 
face. And of course, I was already hurting and to have this insult on top of the injury. 
Was, if anything had made me start smoking again that would have, but it didn’t, so.. 
Hahaha. 
 
Good for you. 
 
Yeah. The way they did it, was underhanded and shady. They, they would not let you 
back on the premises to collect your belongings. They locked you out, I was called, 
what is it about a week… it’s been 6, 7 years now. I was called a week later to come 
over the security to pick up my boxes of personal goods. And when I got there, they 
just tossed them outside, said here you go.  
 
Why was it like that? I mean, if you had gotten laid off, you could’ve gone in, gotten 
your stuff, said goodbye and leave.  
 
Yeah, I could have had my toolbox wheeled out to me and stuff like that. yeah, you’re 
right. But they decided, and ‘they’ being the omnipotent ‘they’ decided that there 
was going to be too much animus, too much hard, too many hard feelings. Well they 
were right. They were right. I was angry, I was very angry. I wouldn’t have done…. I 
wouldn’t have acted on that anger. But to be told that you are the greatest, you know 
greatest PR guy that ever lived one day, and the very next day to be absolutely 
without a job, with no reason being given, is, in my eyes, unacceptable. 
 
Did you ever think about pursuing any legal action, considering that you were 
openly discriminated against? 
 
I was openly discriminated against, but try proving that. I joined a, I joined the suit. 
You know, there’s a suit, and I think it is probably still in progress. But I joined the 
lawsuit of those over 40 who thought that they were discriminated against because 
of age. I tried it individually, and I got all this… I had 2 inches of what I thought was 
documentation, and I went to see a lawyer and I went back the following Monday, 
said, none of this is evidence. It’s all hearsay. So no, I wont take your case. So. 
 
What have you done since then? Career wise, I guess. 
 
You mean after I got done crying a lot?? Hahhaha. Uh, and I should tell you I’ve still 
got a lot of anger in me, a lot of anger and a lot of questions. 
 
What sort of questions? 
 
Well for instance, remember I told you that there was several things that they could 
have done with me? They could have busted me back, as they say, from management 
to being non-management, but let me keep my job. They could have done that. 
(Meow, cat) Sure… uh…. Boeing, the Boeing Company, not Spirit, but Boeing, the 
element of Boeing that was still there, could have hired me as their public relations 
manager, PAO, public affairs officer. But, I got it on fairly good authority that 
someone or several someones in St. Louis said; we wouldn’t hire a commercial 
airplane person from Wichita if they were the last person in the world. Politics. It 
was all politics. So, I can’t remember what the question was because my mind is… 
 
The questions you still have about your firing, you’re being laid off. 
 
Yeah, I think I will have questions until I go to my grave. I really will. Why me? 
Nobody’s talking. Nobody’s talking. You hear a lot of whispering in the background, 
you hear a lot of, Oh did you hear that? You know, I don’t place much credence in 
hearsay, but there were a lot of good people who left that Friday. People who really 
shouldn’t have. And there were a lot of people who were kept on, both in 
management and non-management that really weren’t worth keeping. But that’s the 
way the world goes around, I guess.  
 
Will you talk a little, uh, well what were you doing, and do you remember the 
moment that you heard that they were going to leave Wichita completely, Boeing. 
 
Yeah I was with, I was with a reporter from Seattle, fellow by the name of Dominic 
Gates. Dominic I think is either Irish or Welsh. Uh, anyway, Dominic came to town 
under the guise of doing a story on an airplane, blah, blah, blah. I got him an 
interview with Jeff Turner, who was, and still is, the top guy out there. He got into 
Turner’s office, with me sitting there, and he ambushed Mr. Turner. By saying I 
understand that you are selling the division. And that was the first time I heard of it, 
and I was floored. You know, I kind of thought, you cant sell us! Hahahaha. Well of 
course they can, they are owned by somebody else, they can be sold. But uh, I 
remember thinking, you know, if there is any truth to this guy’s allegations this is 
going to be a major shakeup and a major news item. I wasn’t wrong.  Excuse me.  
(talking to cat) Sarge, do you know that you are plugging up my sinuses?  
 
So you are talking 2011, or 2006 here? The announcement that Boeing was going to 
leave Wichita completely last year. 
 
No. No, let me make sure that we understand what we are talking about. Let me 
understand that I know what I am talking about. Selling the division, becoming what 
is finally Spirit Areosystems. Had nothing at all to do with the Boeing side leaving 
town. I started to talk about rumors that had been happening for years. I remember 
that I was only a couple of years in to my employment with Boeing when I started 
hearing, uh, mobile home park rumors. Literally coming in from the mobile home 
parks, oh, my land is not going to be so valuable when you guys sell out. You know, 
you realize that Boeing is leaving town? And it used to be a joke: Boeing won’t be in 
the phone book in 2000. Boeing won’t be in the phone book in 2005. Boeing won’t 
be in the phone book in 2010. And now, finally, Boeing’s not going to be in the phone 
book. Because they have decided to leave. 
 
So you weren’t surprised when you heard that news? 
 
No. No, I was if it had happened all of a sudden, boom, we are leaving. It would have 
been a little bit, a little bit more… I would have been a little bit more incredulous. 
But little things have happened; contracts have been reduced, budgets have been 
reduced, layoffs have taken place. Until finally you are scaling down and scaling 
down, they’re talking about doing maintenance at other facilities, like tanker 
airforce bases, San Antonio Texas, that no longer make Boeing a premier location. 
Boeing is, Wichita Kansas is ideally suited for the airplane industry because we are 
smack in the middle of the United States, equidistant between any ports. We have an 
absolutely phenomenal rail system that gets out pieces and parts– gets our raw 
materials to us, gets our parts out the door. We’ve got a great workforce, a 
workforce that has been building airplanes since the 1940s. This is an airplane 
town. But I remember one of the Vice Presidents, Dan Hite, Dan was our Vice 
President, general manager for a little while. Dan went to the city and said, you folks 
really… I am going to paraphrase… you folks really need to investigate other ways to 
to build your economy and structure your economy, because the airplane industry is 
not at all strong all the time. It’s cyclical, and it certainly was. When the business 
airplanes went up, commercial airplanes went down. When commercial airplanes 
went up, business airplanes went down, that’s it. So, Dan hite told the way it was 
going to be. He foreshadowed it. Don’t put your eggs all in one airplane making 
basket. And he was right, smart man. 
 
Why do you think they decided to completely leave Wichita? 
 
Oh gosh, I really have no idea. I really don’t. Um, the Air Force airplanes are old now. 
They were new when I came to work, they’re old. There is only so much 
maintenance you can do on an airplane. The B52 and the KC135 are literally 40, 50, 
60 years old. Um, the B52 and the KC135 are Boeing 1950s technology. The 767 
airplane, good airplane, we built, Spirit built 75 percent of it, but to modify it, you 
can only modify 1, 2, 3 planes a year. That can’t keep a workforce. So I think they are 
probably working on the balance sheet and saying, ‘this is work we need to do 
elsewhere.’ I don’t know that, I am just surmising it. I am not an airline, airplane-
making expert. 
 
Can you surmise how long you think corporate headquarters knew they were going 
to leave Wichita? 
 
Oh… I think probably…. When they moved the center of Boeing Military Airplanes to 
Seattle Washington to St. Louis, Missouri I think a lot of stuff came on the drawing 
boards back then, and that was in the early 2000s.  
 
So, they knew longer than one year, which is what they claim still.  
 
Oh, hell yes. Yeah, I think so. They may have made the decision a year ago. They may 
have been saying, ‘Ok, starting right now we are going to make a decision whether 
we are or whether we’re not.’ And that was a year old. But, you don’t make business 
decisions like that over the course of one year. At least I wouldn’t. With a business 
the size of the Boeing company? The greatest single exporter of airplanes in the 
world? No. You can’t make that determination in a year. I think you are always 
looking at it though. You are always looking at how you could do your job better, 
cheaper, faster. Yeah, I think that is what it has come to, cost of labor, cost of 
materials, cost of shipping. Versus the military budget, you know, all of the things 
rolled into, rolled into a formula allowed them to make that decision.  
 
Will Boeing leaving Wichita hurt the community? 
 
Hurt the what please? 
 
Hurt the community? 
 
No. I don’t think so. I honestly don’t. Now, if you asked me if whether leaving Spirit 
would, yeah it would, a big chunk. But Boeing, I don’t know how many employees 
they have now, but since the early 1990s, they have had the minority of 
employment, the Boeing Company here in Wichita. It has always been a 
predominance of commercial airplane workers. Even if there are 2 thousand– now 
that isn’t to say that it won’t be really rough on the men and women who now work 
for Boeing, and either have to A retire or B go look for work. Um, as one who has 
looked for work, and has been retired, not retired on his own, but been retired, uh, I 
know it is a helluva task. Getting a job is easy when you’ve got a job. If you don’t 
have a job, and nowhere to go and you are 45 years old, no. that is going to be 
difficult. But, as a corporate entity, I don’t think the Boeing Company’s passage out 
of Wichita is going to be felt all that much.  
 
I think I probably know the answer to this question, but how do you feel about 
Boeing as your past employer now, 6 years since you left? 
 
I really don’t care whether it stays or it leaves. I honestly don’t. I worked long 
enough to get a small retirement from the Boeing Company, for which I am thankful. 
But, given the way that I was treated in the latter years, I don’t care whether they, 
they could have left town 10 years ago; it wouldn’t have bothered me a bit. Not a bit. 
Am I bitter, yeah I am a little bitter. That’s the answer of a bitter man, and I will be 
the first to admit it. But I think my anger and frustration are just, I think they are 
righteous. I don’t think we were done. I don’t think the 900 and some odd people 
who got laid off when I got laid off were done. It was not done properly. It could 
have been done with a little more finesse, a little bit more caring, a little bit more 
gentility. But it wasn’t and that is water under the bridge.  
 
Have you worked, in traditional employment since you were laid off? 
 
Traditional employment? 
 
Like a go to work, 9 to 5. 
 
Yeah, I have worked in construction, in concrete, I worked in concrete for about a 
year, and then for a general contractor from then until now.  
 
Do you miss PR? 
 
Absolutely, everyday. I miss it like I miss the military. There is not a day that goes by 
that I don’t wish I could put on a uniform and go back. There is not a day that goes 
by that I don’t wish I could put a tie and a suit on and go back to work as a public 
affairs guy, a public relations guy. Sure I miss it, that is all I really knew. That is what 
my degrees are in.  
 
I was supposed to ask that. What universities you attended… 
 
I attended Michigan State University for my baccalaureate, graduated suma cum 
laude in 1972. And I went to the University of Georgia for my master’s, my graduate 
work and a little bit of postgraduate at the University of Oklahoma. 
 
And what degrees did you get, were they in communications? 
 
My bachelor’s degree is Communications; master’s degree is Public Relations. 
 
(To film guy) Anything? 
 
(Film guy) The one question I have, the one time I have heard a positive lilt to your 
voice was when you were talking about the Doc Project. Tell me a little bit more 
about that. 
 
Doc is an airplane that came from California, actually it was out in the Mojave 
Desert, and uh, it was a airplane that had been built in Wichita Kansas in the early 
1940s, had been to war, had been flown into the desert, the pilot and the copilot 
turned the airplane off and walked away, and that was the only thing that that 
airplane saw from then until we got ahold of it in the year 1999, is when it got here 
to Wichita, I think. All of the years kind of go together. A fellow by the name of Tony 
Mezzolini bought the airplane, or bartered for the airplane, tried to rebuild it in 
California, did not find much luck because of workforce, called me. I approached Jeff 
Turner, I wrote a plan, the airplane was allowed to come to Wichita– that was quite 
a day, I just saw those pictures again, last week – airplane arrived, and it was a holy 
mess. It was a terrible mess. You oughta see it now, it is practically ready to be 
flown. I got some of the most talented volunteer workers, male and female, some of 
the people that originally built the airplane in the first place. I got some Rosie the 
Riveters, who had been in WW II, knew everything there was to know about their 
part of building the airplane, but them together, and that was what we did. They 
gave of their time and talent, every single day. Or however long they could do it until 
the airplane… Oh, I wish you could see the then and now photos. Those are some of 
the finest people I have ever had the opportunity to meet. The problem is they are 
dying. We’ve already lost 5 that I know of. I just went to a memorial service last 
weekend, for the last guy that passed away. But the airplane is lacking rebuilt 
engines and fuel bladders to make it certifiable to fly. If it does ever fly, and I hope it 
does, but if it does ever fly, it will be the very last B29 in flight today.  
 
I tried to do a story on that when I first got here a few years ago, because I heard 
from someone that the men and women working on this plane were dying off, and 
their expertise were needed to get it going, and I forget even what it was now, but I 
got sort of in the story and realized that there were lots of things going on around 
their airplane, I think… 
 
You think?!! 
 
It was just messy in there, and I had so little knowledge, of the aircraft industry and 
Wichita I decided it wasn’t a good first story for me to pursue. 
 
And you probably did yourself a favor backing off.  
 
You think it is still a back off story? 
 
Even the Doc Project is being politicized. And if you are too kind to say it, I will say it 
for you: The Doc Project is being politicalized. It is no longer a pure restoration 
effort, you know. The airplane was moved into hangar after hangar, kicked out of 
that hangar, just when we got it set up, it was pull up stakes and move. Pull up 
stakes and move. It was one thing after another. Then, I understand, that when I left 
Boeing they ran out of places to put the airplane and McConnell was good enough to 
store it over at the B1 hangar, but the problem is, that is an area that not everyone 
can get it. It is a closed area; you have to be specially cleared. So, no work has gone 
on on the airplane from then until the time that they moved it back over to the 
hangar at Boeing, and I understand now that it is over at a hangar at Boeing. I was 
persona non-gratis. I had no way of getting back on the real estate, so I couldn’t keep 
track of the airplane, but I do get emails from the folks that are still working on the 
airplane.
