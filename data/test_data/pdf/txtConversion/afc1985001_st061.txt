The Lazy Boy
THE LAZY BOY
Jim Hurlburt Visalia, 1940
Come all you people and listen to my song I'll tell you of a young man who wouldn't hoe
his corn And the reason why I never could tell Because this young man was always well.
He planted his corn all in July And in September he laid it by In October it come a frost
And all this young man's corn was lost.
He went to the fence and he peeped in The careless weeds just struck his chin The weeds
and the grass they growed so tall It caused this young man's heart to fall.
He went to the nearest neighbor's house A-courtin' there for to get him a wife And when
his courtship first begun She said, “Young man, have you hoed your corn?”
He quickly answered in this reply, “Yes, kind maiden, I've laid it by I've worked and I've
tried, but it's all in vain I don't really believe I'll make one grain.
Your courting here is all in vain A lazy man i won't entertain I really believe a horse and a
plow Would suit you better than a wife right now.
