Noʻu Revilla:  ʻO Henrietta Lāʻieikawai Kanana ka wahine. 
ʻO Ventura Repolidon Revilla ke kane. 
Noho pū lāua a hānau ʻia ʻo John Henry Haumea Revilla. 
ʻO John Henry Haumea Revilla ke kane. 
ʻO Deborah Cairme ka wahine. 
Noho pū lāua a hānau ʻia ʻo Noʻukahauʻoli Aisha Revilla. 
ʻO Noʻukahauʻoli Aisha Revilla au.  
He hawaiʻi au.  
 
My name is Noʻukahauʻoli Revilla; everybody calls me Noʻu. The title of my poem is 
“Shapeshifters Banned, Censored, or Otherwise Shit-Listed, aka Chosen Family Poem.” 
 
[Noʻu Revilla Revilla reads “Shapeshifters Banned, Censored, or Otherwise Shit-Listed, aka

NR:  Hāʻōʻū is where my grandmother lives in Hāna on the east side of Maui. My grandmother’s 
name is Lāʻieikawai, and she is the core of my poems, so many of my poems, the core of the 
shapeshifting theme that runs through my work. Even her name, written as Laieikawai without 
diacritical marks on her birth certificate, is debated between her daughters and her 
granddaughters. In her mouth, in the mouth of people who love her or are compelled to her, 
my grandmother’s name shapeshifts. When she is in Hāna, she is Lāʻieikawai or Aunty Lāʻie. 
When she lived on Pōhai Street and her sister Puni was still alive, she did not go by Lāʻieikawai 
at all. As she helped raise me, my grandmother was called Henrietta, the wahine who made 
shave ice at the Kahului laundromat.  
 
Hoʻokahi nō; he lehu ka inoa. 
 
I bring up my grandmother’s name because this poem is both a list poem and a name poem. 
The title “Shapeshifters Banned, Censored, or Otherwise Shit-Listed, aka Chosen Family Poem” 
set the stakes. I knew I would be writing a list poem that would be part gossip, part mele maʻi, 
part Indigiqueer feminist love letter, part decolonial worldbuilding, and most importantly, part 
moʻokūʻauhau.  
 
Moʻokūʻauhau is the Hawaiian concept of genealogy, and as an oral, literary, and rhetorical 
device, moʻokūʻauhau encompasses the composition and recitation of genealogy. More than a 
list of names, moʻokūʻauhau reveal important details of one’s relationship to people, places, 
and responsibilities. Noenoe Silva, an ʻŌiwi historian and language expert, talks about 
“moʻokūʻauhau consciousness” as the interlocking kuleana [sphere of privilege and 
responsibility] to listen, record, and interpret. In Hawaiian culture, the question of who you are 
cannot be answered meaningfully without knowing where and who you come from.  
 
The “Shapeshifters” poem reaches for the understood-but-never-spoken moʻokūʻauhau, the 
lines of relation that are hidden in dark, damp places. I found myself gravitating, unsurprisingly 
as a queer Hawaiian woman, to the image of maʻi. In ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi, maʻi denotes genitals and 
biological genealogies. So in one strand, the poem “Shapeshifters” pursues the question of who 
stole the maʻi, which can invoke any number of smaller pursuits depending on who the reader 
is. “Who stole the maʻi” can mean who stole desire, who stole consent, who stole purity, who 
stole my origin story? The repetition of maʻi plays off the third line: “The one named Mai, Mai, 
E ʻAi.” In Hawaiʻi, mai is a directional that signals movement towards the speaker. “Mai, mai, e 
ʻai” is a common expression that invites people to come and eat. So for people who do not 
speak Hawaiian, playing with mai and maʻi so early on in the poem attempts to unify those lines 
at least sonically and encourages them to widen their attention to what else may share a link to 
the word maʻi. For readers who do speak Hawaiian, the mai-maʻi dynamic is playful; it 
acknowledges a deeper intimacy and invites them to think about connections between 
sexuality, kinship, and sovereignty in Hawaiʻi. 
  
In this way, call-and-response became the governing logic of the first several drafts. I let myself 
be led by the anaphora “the one.” During the drafting stage, I would ask myself, which relations 
would stand together at a party or a funeral and trade gossip? Which relations must be 
separated or all hell breaks loose? Which relations are loud, hungry, haunted? Which relations 
need the space of a longer line to tell you their names properly? In some way, I’m always 
seeking to understand and practice Audre Lorde’s work of biomythography. You know, 
fingering that line between myth, history, and memoir; between individual memory and 
collective memory. And, for me, anaphora can activate that in-between-ness. 
 
I think about my time in graduate school. Craig Santos Perez asked me some of the most 
generative questions during my dissertation, including the very simple question: “What is a 
line?” Technically, I understood the line to be a basic tool of expression, organization, and 
rhythm in a poem. Yet none of what I told him that day satisfied me, and that dissatisfaction 
spurred a new level of rigor and honesty. I needed to bring my ancestors to that question. I 
needed to bring my lands and my language, my ‘ōlelo makuahine, to that question. Because in 
ʻŌiwi poetry, relationships exceed kanaka-to-kanaka [human-to-human] bonds. They include 
intimacies between akua [deities], ʻāina [land], and kanaka[people]. I think about the 
phenomenal Haunani-Kay Trask and her poem “To Write By Moonlight,” where she deploys 
ʻāina-based images of mahina [moon], maiʻa [banana], and niu [coconut] to empower ʻŌiwi 
metaphors and assert the genealogical relationship between ʻŌiwi and our land. In Haunani’s 
poetry, in all of our ʻŌiwi moʻolelo, ʻāina is not passive. ʻĀina is an active and exemplary 
storyteller, and as ʻŌiwi are descendants of ʻāina, Haunani’s poem was one of the first to imply, 
for me, that ʻŌiwi literary production is not only a creative act but also a genealogical 
inheritance. 
 
And here we come back to the role of moʻokūʻauhau, so that persistent question of “what is a 
line?” What is a line of poetry? What is a bloodline? What is a line? 
 
And one of the most rewarding experiences of “Shapeshifters” was being able to perform the 
poem for Leanne Simpson. I had the honor of opening her reading event in Honolulu in 
February 2019, and I performed the piece in a set of poems that I framed as a way of 
introducing Leanne to my family. Leanne’s work is so vital. My body exploded when I 
read Islands of Decolonial Love, and I had just finished reading As We Have Always Done, which 
inspired another poem I wrote called “so sacred, so queer.” And I find that gratitude inspires 
reciprocity, and I am so grateful for Leanne Simpson. Performing the poem for her that night 
felt like an ancestral moment. 
 
And so with “Shapeshifters,” I wanted to establish shapeshifting in the context of Native 
Hawaiian wahine, intergenerational stories, queer desire, and consent. How can a list of 
individuals grow into a “we”? Because chosen family is about cultivating shared ground beyond 
bloodlines but also beyond trauma. When I say my ea is bound to your ea, I want to work for 
our shared ground to mean more than shared histories of violence or kill-ability or the struggle 
to survive. There are so many queer Indigenous women writing poetry in Oceania right now, 
and we deserve more than a lifetime in metaphor. I write poetry to root me to my 
moʻokūʻauhau and to re-route worlds of pain toward strength and strategy. “Shapeshifters 
Banned, Censored, or Otherwise Shit-Listed, aka Chosen Family Poem” is an ancestor-affirming, 
sex-positive, queer-loving, and queer-living work.  
 
E ka poʻe moʻo, in whatever skin you have chosen today, I see you. I believe you. A hiki i ke 
aloha ʻāina hope loa.
