"Dear Mr. President", Detroit, Michigan, January or February 1942
AFS 6426A
Bill O'Melia: Mr. President, I'm Bill O'Melia. Right now we're in the plant of the Barnes Products,
Incorporated in Detroit. We're a small outfit compared with many plants around here, but we want
you to know we're behind you one hundred percent and that we're all out for this job of winning
the war. The Barnes family has been making computing scales for about fifty years. You'll find their
scales all over the world and good scales too because I helped to make them. Now, we're feeding
parts into the big plants of Detroit so that they can do the job that you want done.
Our plants switched over to defense work and us fellas who have made scales most of our lives
are now doing something different. Curly Holdsapple over there has been a scale painter for forty-
five years. Now he's operating a mealing machine and doing a good job of it too. I sealed scales for
around twenty years and I'm running a [school (?)] machine now and the boss says I'm doing fine.
I suppose there are hundreds of thousands of fellas like me and thousands of small plants like the
Barnes Products that have swung over one hundred percent to winning the war. The big plants get
their names in the papers, but believe me us little fellas are doing an important job too.
Well, I've got to back to work now. Just want you to know we'll see you through.
