There is a 
little fellow, who no doubt you all have seen, 
And Charley is the charmer's Christian name; 
Jle dresses in the fashion, with a 
bright neck-tie 
of green, 
And to tell the truth he never looks the same. 
fits hair he curls quite nobby, and his moustache 
waxed to kill, 
He's gotten up expressly for the day; 
lie stands upon the corners, but really can't keep still, 
And should you chance to meet him I 
am sure 
you'd say— 
Cnonus. 
Charley he's a 
masher, Charley he's a 
pet, 
Charley he's a 
darling, he's a 
dandy you can bet; 
He's the object of attention from all the ladies fair, 
And when he's out on promenade you should 
see them at him stare. 
He attends all the theatres, and seems perfectly at home, 
Has invitations to the parties, balls, and fairs, 
He's a 
sort of privileged character and is always 
seen alone, 
He seems to run the gauntlet everywhere, 
lie's polished in his manner, in a 
la-de-da sort of way, 
But how he lives I'll leave it all to -you, 
You couldn't help but notice him he always looks so gay, 
It's a 
mystery how they do it but they do.

Behold the Killarney Musketeers a 
walking 
down Broadway, 
With bayonets brightly glistening, and the band 
so gaily play; 
They're the finest soldiers in the land, and of 
battle not afraid, 
And they show the people how they shine, 
when out on grand parade. 
See the stalwart officers, and privates in the rear, 
The captain he is urging on the men that know no fear; 
So let us join together now and give three hearty cheers, 
And raise it, too, for the boys in blue, the 
Killarney Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
All face about, all turn around, and raise your 
muskets from the ground, 
They marched away, so light and gay, with 
hearts that knew no fear, 
Three hundred solid Irish boys to protect their 
homes so dear; 
So let us join together now and give three hearty cheers, 
And raise it, too, for the boys in blue, the 
Killarney Musketeers. 
To-night, my boys, they're going to give a 
dashing fancy ball, 
Representing the American style up in McClellan Hall; 
The Skidmore's in full uniform, along with 
Brannigan's Band, 
The Sixty-Ninth and Musketeers will parade 
on the grand stand. 
The ladies waving American flags, ' twill be a , 
grand display, 
Mingling with the dreamy waltz, enjoying a 
holiday; 
With boys so true, dressed up in blue, we'll 
give three hearty cheers, 
For the best parade that ever was made by the 
Killarney Musketeers. 
PEBBLES IN THE SEA, 
itrarrATIoN. 
BY ANNIE HERBERT. 
RECITED BY ADA BURNETT. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, BY MRS. PAULINE LIEBER. 
Who shall judge a 
man from nature, 
Who shall know him by his dress; 
Paupers may be fit for princes, 
Princes fit for something less. 
Crumpled shirt, and dirty jacket, 
May beclothe both you and me, 
So with your lot try be contented, 
As the Pebbles in the sea. 
There are springs of crystal nectar, 
Ever swelling out of stone, 
There are purple buds and golden, 
Hidden, crushed, and overgrown; 
God who counts by souls, not dresses, 
Loves and prospers you and me; 
While He values thrones the highest, 
But as Pebbles in the sea. 
There are foam embroidered oceans, 
There are little weed clad rills, 
There are feeble inch high saplings, 
There are cedars on the hills. 
God who counts by souls, hot stations, 
Loves and prospers you and me, 
For to Him all vain distinctions 
Are as Pebbles in the sea. 
Truth and justice, are eternal, 
Born with loveliness and light; 
Secret wrong shall never prosper, 
While there is a 
starry night. 
God whose world-heard voice is singing, 
Boundless love to you and me, 
sinks oppression with its titles, 
As the Pebbles in the sea,

We never can contented be, 
With our own lot in life; 
We've always trouble on our mind, 
Some new born care or strife. 
Why not travel through the world 
With sunshine on your brow, 
For you'll never know the difference 
In a 
thousand years from now. 
CHORUS. 
Don't try to read the future, then, 
For this, and that, and how; 
For you'll never know the difference, 
In a 
thousand years from now. 
'Twon't do to be too proud these days, 
Because you have your wealth; 
You may some time the wrong man meet, 
And thereby lose your health. 
Don't scorn to earn your living, 
By the hoe, the spade, or plow; 
For you'll never know the difference 
In a 
thousand years from now. 
Chorus. 
Because your parents are well off, 
Don't scorn to learn a 
trade; 
Remember when the sun is warm, 
You can't always find the shade. 
Don't scorn to do a 
little work, 
Though sweat adorn your brow, 
For you'll never know the difference 
In a 
thousand years from now.

loved alone to wander 
In the happy days long flown, 
O'er fields and meadows fair, to gather 
Bright-hued blossoms, freshly blown, 
Soon beyond the rippling river, 
Winding onwards o'er the plain; 
The buds may burst, but, I 
shall never 
Gather them for you again.

I've been dreaming, oh! yes, I've been dreaming, 
Of things that occur every day; 
I've been dreaming of people who worry, 
And plod through the world in dismay. 
They grumble at all that's around them, 
And snarl like a 
cur in the street, 
While if you attempt to approach them, 
They'll squirm like the snake at your feet. 
CHORUS. 
This world is as good as they make them, 
But snarlers I 
say, we must " shake " them, 
For no matter what way you may take them, 
They'll worry and grumble the same. 
I've been dreaming, oh! yes, I've been dreaming 
Of women who try to do well. 
But are always abused by their husbands, 
For failings too numerous to tell. 
If victuals ain't cooked right to suit them, 
They'll curse everything in the land; 
And if the poor woman disputes them, 
She feels the effect of a 
hand. 
Chorus. 
I've been dreaming, oh! yes, I've been dreaming, 
Of days in the future I 
see; 
When acts of the present will vanish, 
And all will be happy and free. 
As things at this time are progressing, 
A 
change for the better, we need, 
For now it is really distressing, 
To look on each dastardly deed.

As through life we journey onward, 
Queer sayings one hears, when traveling about; 
Some are odd, peculiar expressions, 
As " Put away the cradle baby's out." 
So now with your kind attention, 
I'll sing of the latest one to you; 
One that's sure to catch the fancy, 
And also become a 
popular one, too. 
Spoken.—You have heard all the expressions. 
" 
You're too fresh," " You're too new," etc, but 
the latest is— 
CHORUS. 
•' Tie him up, my friend," tie him up, 
Tie him up, now mind what I 
say; 
You'll be sorry when you're sober, 
And your little spree is over, 
Tie him up, without any delay. 
This world is composed of all sorts of people, 
Who occupy different stations in life, 
The rich and the poor are mingled together, 
A 
living to gain in this sea of strife. 
It matters not where fortune may bring you, 
Slang phrases one hears from day to day; 
The old and the young the same it both pleases, 
As " I 
should remark," and " Nay, Gussie, nay.* 
Spoken—Yes, one hears some very odd, peculiar 
expressions through travelling about, but I 
think 
the latest and the best one is—

When I 
was a 
lad about sixteen, 
I 
travelled with a 
circus and sold ice cream; 
I 
polished up the handle of the elephants trunk, 
And slept in a 
cage with a 
big sick monk. (Break.) 
I 
done ray work in such a 
rage, 
They made me ruler of the monkey's cage; 
I 
fed them on the European plan, 
And they got so weak they could not stand. 
When the show would commence, I'd watch for beatg, 
With a 
club I'd sail round under the seats; 
My legs got crooked and my back got bent, 
Watching for kids sneaking under the tent. (Break. 
I 
said " what, never," to a 
mule in fun, 
And got kicked through the roof of the big bass drum, 
It wasn't the fall that made me kick, 
But stopping quite so sudden made me sick. 
They brought me to, with a 
kerosene pump, 
And the doctor said I 
was off my chump, 
They laid me out on the trick mule's back, 
And I 
went through the roof when he took up 
the slack. (Break.) 
Came down head first, and went clean through a 
dray, 
The horse got frightened and he ran away; 
My voice got broke and my face got scarred. 
And now I'm door-tender in a 
big grave yard.

I'll tell you about a 
young man that I 
know, 
He was struck on the actors, likewise the show; 
He had a 
big wart on the side of his nose, 
From Nicoll the tailor, he got all his clothes. 
He tried to make love to " Aileen Alanna," 
And got hit on the head with a 
rusty bananna; 
He went to sit down in a 
ballet girl's lap, 
And got hit with a 
dummy, and fell through a 
trap. 
CHORUS. 
His front name was Billy, and a 
mule kicked 
him silly, 
While going up an alley to see his girl Sally, 
He struck on his head, and they thought he was dead, 
For he was badly pock-marked from eating stale bread 
He kicked the wheels out of " Grandfather's clock," 
And hit " Baby Mine" in the ear with a 
rock; 
In the railroad strike he got lost in the street, 
And walked till his corns were covered with feet. 
He tried to play base ball, the boys got him tight, 
He got hit with a 
bat and went clear out of sight; 
He went up in the gallery to keep the boys quiet, 
And got shot in the back at the Baltimore Riot. 
CHORUS. 
His teeth were home-made, seven dollars he paid, 
On his breath you could ride, like a 
clam in high tide; 
He dressed like a 
mummy and thought it was funny, 
To be taken for a 
gawk without any money,

'Twits at a 
ball I 
first met my girl, 
The fairest in the land; 
She had pearly teeth, and a 
dimpled chin, 
And a 
little slender hand. 
She skipped around in the mazy waltz, 
As graceful as a 
fawn; 
When the dance was o'er I 
asked her 
Would she walk upon the lawn. 
Caoaus. 
We sat by the brook, 
'Neath the stars so brigh.., 
And whispered words of love 
On that summer night. 
We walked and talked, 
As the hours rolled by, 
In the moonlight I 
kissed heg 
As her heart heaved a 
sigh. 
Next eve we met near a 
running stream, 
And I 
walked close by her side, 
I 
told her then, how I 
loved her so, 
And she said she'd be my bride. 
How happy I'll be all the while, 
When Irene is my wife; 
We'll have a 
cot by a 
babbling brook, 
And will settle down in life.

On Richmond Hill there lives a

With eyes like morning dew,

WHICH OF THE TWO.

Which of the two, rich or the poor, 
Will win in this race of life? 
When fortune leaves wealth at one man's door, 
At his neighbor's bestows toil and strife. 
Yet contentment may be the rich fruit of toil, 
While the wealth, yield but grief and dismay. 
And the bundle of riches we strive so to gain, 
May be gone in a 
single day. 
'There are two pathways open for all men to Mad, 
By the crooked and straight we must go; 
Choose early, choose right, ere your chances are dead, 
Choose carefully, which of the two. 
'The beggar was sitting one day in the street, 
The day our Redeemer was born; 
Merry Christmas bells ringing, he'd nothing to eat 
For his family since yesterday morn. 
A 
woman of sin, passing, emptied her purse, 
Dropped her vail, to hide sympathy's tear; 
The next woman, a 
rich lady, passed into the church, 
Looking scorn on the miserable pair; 
I 
could not help thinking how our Saviour had died, 
To transform sinful sons, bright and new; 
The gilded, and real, stood exposed to me then,

The most that she wore was an old woolen hood, 
Which protected her head as well as it could; 
The ground was hard-frozen, and covered with sleet, 
With only the shreds of shoes on her feet, 
The rest of her raiment was frightfully thin, 
She actually stood in hell to her chin. 
For hours this poor wretch had wandered the streets 
Looking for work or something to eat; 
When she chanced to pass a 
half drunken man, 
To him she falteringly held out her hand; 
In the name of our Maker, help me, she said, 
Please give me enough for one loaf of bread. 
CONTINUED. 
One loaf of bread, returned the wild sot, 
I'll give you whatever change I've got; 
I 
never go back on such people as you, 
Here, take it, it's only a 
dollar or two, 
I 
won it at play, 'tis an ill-gotton gain, 
But 'twill keep you from starving, all the same. 
There was charity forgotten as soon as 'twits given, 
No note taken of it, unless ' twas in Heaven; 
'Twas an act on the impulse, pure, without taint, 
And worthy of praise from sinner or saint, 
Yet in these days of technical charity, 
'Twas only a 
deed of low immorality. 
For thelhand that throttled the wolf at the door, 
Was spotted with sin, aye, black to the core; 
The gift was unorthordox, made by the devil, 
No good can result from aught that is evil; 
And yet, on the moment when our Saviour died, 
A 
thief was his friend, a

When I 
was but sixteen, I 
thought, 
I'd no longer remain single, 
But take for better or for worse, 
A man by the name of Jingle. 
He was handsome, only twenty-one, 
With blue eyes and raven hair, 
I 
thought I'd done the thing, in fact, 
I 
was so happy I 
do declare. 
CHORUS. 
It's all very well to married be, 
And think you'll live in clover; 
But it all depends on your husband dear, 
When the honeymoon is over, 
My husband he has put a 
stop 
To all joys that may be; 
While he flies out to visit round, 
I'm left,to nurse the baby. 
He thinks it is a 
woman's duty, 
To slave from morn till night, 
While he enjoys the pleasures of life, 
In a 
manner he thinks quite right. 
Chorus. 
Now sooner than be what I 
am, 
With every day a 
wrangle, 
By jove, I'd sooner single live, 
By turning round a 
mangle. 
So now, I've told you ladies all 
If you would live in clover, 
Pray get a 
husband who'll treat you right 
When the honeymoon is over.

I 
was invited by a 
friend of the fair; 
It was there I 
met Mary Ann Hoolahan, 
Who wore great big bangs on her hair. 
There was plenty to drink in the ccrner, 
And you can bet I 
took it in; 
And before the party was over, 
I 
was full to the neck of bad gin.

There was all the gang there with their partners, 
With girls who were known everywhere; 
But the one that caught me with her tra-la-la-le, 
Was Mary Ann with the bangs on her hair. 
They fired me out on the door-step, 
When a 
cop came and took me right in, 
They shoved me in a 
cell where I 
lay all night, 
To soak out that awful bad gin. 
I 
was taken to court in the morning, 
When I

And you can bet I'm a

If again I

We have a 
son, and we're told he's a 
bum, 
He works in the art of terpsicho. 
His name is James McCharty, 
Of that we're proud, you know; 
Be looks like his ma-ma, and takes after his pa-pa, 
He's a 
masher wherever he'd go. 
Cnonus. 
He's our darling, pride, and joy, 
The girls all say he's a 
handsome boy, 
He takes in all the dances, 
And waltzes 'round on the floor, 
On " AlcDonald's tin roof," 
And on " Our front stoop," 
He sings in the " Hall way door. 
When first he went 'round the theatre, 
He got work on the stage; 
But since that time, he's not been worth a 
dime, 
Like our daughter Julia, he's all the rage. 
He takes a 
big part in the can-can, 
Whenever it's played any place, 
He wears Baxter Street shoes, and tobacco he chews, 
And they say he's a 
pretty hard case.

One day while leisurely traveling, 
In a 
city far out in the West; 
By flirting I 
made the acquaintance 
Of a 
lady of elegant dress. 
While conversing, she asked me my business, 
With a 
thought I 
very promptly replied, 
I 
am a 
traveling agent from Boston, 
But to tell you the truth, I 
lied. 
She said her folks were all actors, 
Had made a 
million or more, 
And lived in an elegant mansion, 
Also kept a 
large furniture store. 
Her mother and father are gymnasts, 
Most every one said they were smart; 
Her brother was a 
song and dance man, 
And she sat on the first part. 
Her time was all filled for next season, 
But at present had nothing to do; 
As some of her dates had been cancelled, 
Which at times made her feel rather blue. 
For she said she was good in her business, 
To excuse her if I 
thought it conceit, 
But could show me some very fine notices, 
For looking so nice in her seat. 
• 
Her last speech made me laugh rather hearty, 
And finally I 
bade her adieu; 
And promised to meet her next evening, 
Which I 
had no intention to do. 
Good times one can have when traveling, 
Gawks I 
have met everywhere; 
But this one I 
think was the darling, 
The actress whose prop was a 
chair.

Lonely to-night she stands at tha door, 
Of the rude little hut, on the rocky-bound shore, 
Dreary without, with hail, and with rain, 
Whilst the wind fiercely blows 'gainst the 
cracked window-pane. 
Deeply she sighs, then turns her aside, 
While the clouds gather dark, and the earth 
seems to hide; 
Chilly the rain, while the lightening's bright glare, 
Sending flash after flash, quickly cuts thro' the air. 
Sadly she thinks, this is her refrain, 
As the thoughts like the storm, wildly pass 
through her brain; 
Must I 
remain, and father not here, 
rfwere foolish, of winds and of waves I've no fear. 
Quickly she dons her clothing to start 
For the love of her father was deep in her heart; 
Eagerly down the rough path to the shore, 
Like a 
fairy she speeds where the waves loudly roar. 
Faster, sweet maid, or yet you'll be late, 
Do not linger, the billows, storm-tossed will not wait; 
Roaring so loud, they drown the wild cry 
Of the hardy old mariner, now doomed to die. 
AT LAST.

At last the ties are broken, 
And the tightened heart strings riven, 
The love is now returned to me, 
Which erstwhile I 
had given, 
The only one in all this world, 
For whom within my breast. 
The spark of love had kindled, 
E'en now shuns me with the rest. 
I 
think upon the happy days, 
That with her I 
have passed, 
When first I 
offered her my heart, 
They were too sweet to last. 
But time has wrought a 
subtle change, 
Another seeks my place; 
To gain in her affections, 
And no more I'll see her face. 
But though we'll never meet again, 
Yet deep within my heart, 
I'll cherish fond remembrance, 
And with it shall not part. 
May Heaven's bounteous blessing, 
Her cup of pleasure fill, 
And though she be another's, 
Yet I 
shall love her still.

lie was old, and weak, and shabbily dressed, 
The time-beaten wreck of a 
man; 
Whose story the passer-by, might have guessed, 
If the face he had stopped to scan. 
Fate had dealt him many a 
blow, 
Now squarely, and now from behind; 
With sickness and poverty laying him low, 
Then cruelly making him blind. 
As I 
dropped a 
dollar into his hat, 
I 
said, your lot is hard; 
But he cheerfully answered, " yes it is that,, 
For I'm blind, and poor, and bared 
From all that gives to life its joy; 
Yet, perhaps it's only my share; 
For the man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear. 
I 
walked through a 
famous up-town square. 
And. I 
envied the rich man's ease; 
But, lo 1 
on the silver door-knob, there, 
A 
crape fluttered out on the breeze. 
Ah ! this, I 
reflected, is gold's alloy, 
And I 
muttered to empty air; 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear.

LIFE'S CROSSES. 
CONTINUED. 
I 
heard the plaudits and laughter ring, 
In a 
theatre packed to the walls; 
Where the Star was a 
famous comedy king, 
Who smiled in response to the calls; 
Yet I 
knew he had buried— that day—the joy 
Of a 
life, with his dead child fair; 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear. 
I 
thought of a 
poet who labored long, 
In anguish and want, alone, 
Till he rose on the mighty.wings of song, 
To the heights which few have known. 
Then fell the blight of desease to destroy 
The sweets he had won in despair; 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear. 
I 
thought of a 
judge who was honered of men, 
For the power and place he had won; 
Yet the felon one day in the prisoner's pen, 
Was the judge's only son. 
And the iron law the judge could employ, 
While the father was crushed in despair. 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear. 
And thinking of this, how wealth and fame, 
And honor and power and all; 
May each have its grief to hide, or its shame. 
I 
could not choose, but recall. 
The words that beggar blind could employ, 
In his cheery philosophy rare; 
The man was never yet born, my boy, 
Who hadn't his cross to bear.

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
RECITED BY GUS WILLIAMS. 
27 
The woman was old and raged and gray. 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, - 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery street. 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
" 
I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided thii trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
I' " 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, 
( '-'-- 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
A 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand 
To help my mother—you understand! 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
" 
Somebody's mother." bowed low her head, 
In her home that night, and the prayer she said, 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice, and worn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
Angels caught the faltering word, 
And " Somebody's mother's" prayer was heard.

On these Hoft and balmy evenings, 
When the stars are shining bright, 
To be wand'ring with your sweetheart, 
Is a 
source of great delight. 
Just one kiss and then another, 
For she must not stay out late, 
Oh I

delicious hours of courtship, 
Loving smiles intoxicate, 
Rosy lips all ripe for kissing, 
Breathinw sweet words at the gate.

Now a 
blush and then a 
sigh, 
Not a 
word above a 
whisper, 
Lest some prying one is nigh. 
Thros the vines papa is peeping, 
And he could not help exclaim, 
Let the dear young ones enjoy it,

Deep sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
For on this day my infant died, 
This day one year ago 
A tender bud so beautiful, 
So fragile, pure and fair, 
Its fragrance far too sweet to waste 
On earth's t.in-tainted air. 
Through many sad long hours of pain, 
My precious darling lay ; 
Then God in sweet compassion took, 
My little one away. 
As cold and rigid in my arms, 
His lifeless form was placed, 
such agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced. 
CHORUS. 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died, baby died, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day. 
In meek submission how I 
bowed, 
To God's all- wise decree, 
Be only took unto Himself 
The one He gave to me. 
And yet I 
never see a 
babe, 
But sca'ding tears will start, 
And longlv I 
crave to clasp 
My lost one to my heart. 
If I 
my future home could choose, 
In realms where glory reigns, 
I'd ask to dwell with angel babes, 
Ever singing heavenly strains ; 
For sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
For on this day my baby died, 
This day one year ago.

Oh! my name it is Teddy McFadden, 
I'm a 
broth of a 
boy, you may bet; 
As wild and as free as the divil, 
I'm truly my mother's own pet. 
At euchre, and poker, and cortin' 
You may stake your last cent I 
am quick; 
I'm in love with a 
half dozen damsels, 
And they call me a 
real Irish brick.

Teddy, Teddy, you know you're a 
broth of a 
boy, 
Teddy, Teddy, you're sunshine an 1 music and joy, 
Teddy, Teddy, you really don't know what I 
mean, 
Teddy, Teddy, oh! Teddy please scare me again. 
I've a 
smart little darling who loves me, 
And just what she is, you may guess; 
I 
kissed her once very politely, 
And I 
thought it would scare her to death. 
Then I 
asked her very kindly her pardon, 
For I 
thought all my love was in vain; 
But she smiled as she whispered so sweetly, 
Oh! Teddy, please scare me again. 
Chorus. 
I 
asked her one night if she'd marry, 
A 
wild little blarney like me, 
And she acted so very much frightened, 
I 
thought on my soul, she would die. 
But I 
talked very kindly, regretting, 
How naughty and bold I 
had been, 
When she kissed me, and said like an angel, 
Oh! Teddy, please scare me again. 
Chorus. 
Now, boys, do be careful in courtin' 
Remember distinctly, just this; 
When a 
girl Says " no," with a 
vengeance, 
She means nothing else then, but " yes." 
Be up like a 
man, pop the question, 
And if she don't smile on you then, 
Just act very mum for a 
minute, 
And she'll ask you to scare her again.

Lonely and weary, poor, homeless, forsaken, 
Out in the cold bitter hours of the night, 
Wandering far away, while fears awaken. 
Dread of the fast, coming sunbeam. of light. 
Far from the home and the plea4u ,es of childhood, 
With vile companions an exile from joy ; 
Longing once more for the charms of the wildwood, 
And for dear mother to welcome her boy, 
Citenus. 
Go f.r my boy for I 
know he's heart broken. 
Bring him once more to life's sunshine and joy, 
Thus in the. Id home a

Must he repose neath the pale evening star ?

CONTIN UED. 
Oh ! 
how she peers in the face of each stranger, 
Eager to see her boys smiles once again ; 
Longing and praying to shield him from danger, 
Anxious to care for and soothe him in pain. 
Lone is the heart of that poor mother waiting, 
Wrinkled and gray, for one moment of joy; 
While with his evil companions he's straying, 
Far from the mother who longs for her boy. 
Go for my boy, dm. 
Once he was pure as the babe in the manger, 
But friends were false, and they led him astray, 
Far from his home lie has wandered a 
stranger, 
Reckless through drink, as you see him to-day! 
But who can tell how his heart has been saddened, 
When he has dreamed of loit friendship and joy, 
With no sweet thoughts when his brain has been maddened 
Mother would welcome her wandering boy. 
Go for my boy, dw, 
Go for my boy to-night ! search through the city ! 
Tell him dint mother will never forget! 
Though he is fallen— oh ! bring him in pity, 
Back to the mother who loves her boy yet! 
Tell him she never will weary of prayirg 
For his return bringing sunshine and joy; 
Bear him this message, where'er he is straying, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Go for my boy, lee.

Blossom in the meadows, where I 
often stray 
To meet that little fairy that comes at close of day. 
How I

And I 
love her fondly, more than words can tell,

The old willow chair now so aged and worn, 
Where grandmother sat years before I 
was born. 
Though covered with dust, and so nearnts decay, 
Is dear to my heart in its treasures to-day. 
There often my mother would rock me to sleep, 
And when I 
was young o'er my fevered cheek weep; 
And then I 
would list to her low fervent prayer, 
While held in her arms, in the obi willow chair. 
CHORUS. 
It rooked me by day, and it rocked me by night, 
While with us sweet songs filled my heart with deli," 
And then her dear lips, would repeat a

While holding me safe in the old willow chair. 
I 
do not remember my grandmother mild, 
For when sire went home I 
was only a 
child ; 
But mother has told me again and again, 
How calmly she bore all the long years of pain. 
By day and by night, she was happy they say, 
In rocking the hours and the moments away, 
And this is the present she left to our care, 
The best of all treasures her old willow chair. 
It stood in the kitchen, long, long years ago, 
Through many a 
season of sunshine and snow, 
The old willow chair that our grandmother mad*, 
And wl,ere in the slumbers of youth I 
was laid, 
And there in the days I 
now love to recall, 
It was by our circle most treasured of all; 
Butt sow in the garret a

ISY WALTER MACK, TO MISS VIOLA CLIFTON. 
We struck a 
town at midnight, 
Us actors, tired, and weary, 
We walked eleven dusty miles, 
And prospects still looked dreary. 
We asked a 
landlord where that night, 
We'd lay us down in slumber; 
He says, ha, ha! I 
have place 
Behind yon pile of lumber. 
We slept that night behind the pile, 
The theremometer stood at thirty; 
As daylight broke, we all awoke, 
Hungry, cold, aal dirty. 
We started away before breakfast, 
With our worn-out grips in our hand; 
And counted the ties to Boston, 
And at Dudley's we made our first staid. 
For food we braced the actors, 
Also the hangers on; 
They steered us to the lunch bar, 
But, alas all the beans were gone.

Can you forgive and forget, love, 
Can you forgive for love's sake? 
Bury the past with the dead, love. 
And let the old love awake! 
Oh! why did I 
list to others 
Who spoke unkindly of thee ? 
Oh ! would that I 
had believed you, 
When you said you loved but me, 
Can you forgive and forget, love ? 
Let your heart, love, speak for you, 
Others told me you were false, love, 
But now I 
know you were true. 
Oh! take me back to your heart, love, 
There let me evermore live, 
Then let your answer be " yes," lova, 
Say you'll forget and forgive.

One to which I

'Tis a

He called me unto his side; 
Take this ring, forget me not! 
Whispered Willie, then he died.

wear, 
What to ine's a

While grim death stood in the door: 
Willie looked at me and said, 
Sister, sing to me once more ? 
Sing that song of angel's love, 
For ere long I 
shall be one, 
And when I'm in Heaven above, 
I 
will watch and guide thee on. 
Chorus. 
In the cold, cold church-yard tomb, 
Lies our little Willie love, 
While his soul has floated home 
To that golden land above. 
Oft while lying on my bed, 
Tears unto my eyes will spring. 
Thinking o'er what Willie said, 
When he gave to me this ring.

Bow are yous one and all, 
sure we thot' we'd make a 
call, 
And tell you all about the widow's party, 
'[was at Paythogoras Hall, 
We gave a 
break- down ball, 
And invited all the young f-lks gay and hearty, 
There was handsome Paday Grace, 
Sure he's now on the police, 
He was put there by a 
pol-i-tic-al party. 
He came from County Cork, 
To the City of New York, 
He joked and sang and made us all feel hearty. 
CHORUS. 
Ah ! the charming Widow Clancy, 
She was any man's fancy, 
She was a 
fluent talker, and a 
rattling six-day walks.; 
And a 
Venus is the charming Widow Clancy. 
McGinn sang Pin-a- fore, 
Till his throat was very sore, 
And " Little Dudeen," sang by Smith so sweetly, 
Crosby sang a 
little ditty, 
The girla all called him witty, 
And McGuffin done an Irish jig so neatly. 
Flynn sang, " Dancing on the green," 
Also " She's a 
fairy queen." 
Flood sang " Hold the fort for we're the 
strongest party," 
And Murphy and 'I 
im Lang, 
Done the Lack-a-wan-na Gang, 
Down at the charming Widow Clancy's party. Cho. 
As it was growing late, 
Sure we tho't was time to ate, 
We went in two by two's down to the sapper, 
We were hardly seated right, 
When there was a 
fearful fight, 
For McGuinness swore the whiskey was all water, 
All around ' twas hand to hand, 
And they nearly killed the band, 
When in 
the famous boxer Mike McCarthy, 
He swore by the powers above, 
That he'd just put on the gloves, 
And cle.tr out every sucker in the party.

In looking at the lads and lassies on the green ; 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I

Of a 
pretty Irish girl, her teeth as bright as pearls, 
And such rosy cheeks, I 
never saw before; 
Her eyes they are so bright, they shine like stars 
at night, 
Sure she is the only girl that I 
adore. 
She is like the birds of May, singing all the day, 
And her like I'm sure that you have never seen; 
Mary Ellen, that's her name, she lives down in the lane, 
And I 
call her my pretty Irish Queen. 
CHORUS. 
My pretty, my pretty, my pretty Irish Queen,

And I

You should see my pretty pearl, as she's skipping 
to the well, 
With her little water pail upon her arm, 
'With her lovely flowing hair, arra.h, with her 
none can compare. 
And all the Irish hearts she does charm. 
Next Sunday night at eight, down by the garden gate, 
I'll present her with a 
wedding ring; 
And happy'll be the day, when to the church 
we will away, 
And I'll marry ray pretty Irish Queen.

And we are going to the ball. 
For Pete and Hanna both feel good. 
We will dance the gay quadrille, 
For music charms, we can't keep still, 
There will be lots of fun, you bet there will, 
Singing and dancing, kissing, too; 
Throwing around our great big shoes, 
As around the hall we spread, 
When Pete and Hannah both get wed. 
The two fat gals that weighed a 
ton, 
Are coming for to have some fun; 
And Captain Primrose he will be there, 
With his Angelina, oh! so fair. 
Goodness! won't them wenches swell, 
With perfume won't they smell, 
And their lover's they will tell, 
That we will join them in the dance; 
Oh! my, won't them wenches prance, 
Like a 
jackass they will tread,

It was just behind the woodshed, 
One glorious summer day; 
Far o'er the hills the sinking sui, 
Pursued its western way. 
And in my lone seclusion, 
Safely removed afar 
From all earth's confusion, 
I 
smoked my first cigar. 
Ah! bright the boyish fancies, 
Wrapped in the wreaths of blue, 
My eyes grew dim my head was light 
The woodshed round me flew, 
Dark night closed in around me, 
Rayless without a 
star, 
Grim death I 
thought I 
had found, 
When I 
smoked my first cigar. 
I 
heard my fathers smothered laugh, 
It seemed so strange and far; 
I 
knew he knew, I 
knew he knew, 
I'd smoked ray first cigar.

! 
I 
love to recount all the joys of my childhood , 
And tell of those strains that were once dear to me; 
When I 
first learned to sing with the voice of my mother, 
And live in her smiles while I 
sat on her knee. 
It is bliss to remember each love-note of gladness, 
The sweet mellow chords that would come 
with the morn, 
But the dearest by far was that soul stirring music 
Our mother would play on the old dinner horn. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! the old dinner horn, yes the old dinner horn, 
How sweet was the sound of the old dinner horn; 
Oh! how sweet was the sound of that 
• 
soul-stirring music, 
Our mother would play on the old dinner hoon; 
On the old dinner horn, on the old dinner horn. 
How eager we listened to hear the sweet music, 
While patiently waiting the hour that would bring 
Relief from our labor in forest and meadow, 
The cutting of wood, and seed planting in spring. 
When noon-time came round, with what pleasure 
we hurried 
O'er meadows of clover, and fields grown with corn, 
For we heard in the distance, that soul-stirring music, 
Our mother would play on the old dinner horn. 
When the harvest was o'er, and the golden fruit 
gathered, 
Our heart was as happy as happy could be; 
For the toil of the season brought health and 
contentment, 
And sunbeams fell lightly o'er wood-land and lea. 
But while watching the bloom of the 
newly-leaved clover, 
Or gazing on fields of the tall waving corn, 
1Iow eager we listened to catch the sweet music, 
That came to our ears from the old dinner horn. 
Chorus.

We're both growing aged together, 
And Jennie has left the old farm ; 
To walk by the side of another, 
As on in U.'s j,urney they roam, 
And John who was tender and loving, 
Has gone in the pathwhy to harm; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the rartn. 
CiloRQ 
It's sad to be aged and feeble, 
And know that this life has no Charm, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm. 
Vire thought J 
oh n 
would be our proteetiOn, 
For he was so kind when a 
boy; 
And lietsey so gentle and loving, 
Would call him a mother's fond joy. 
But he was led off by companions, 
In ways that bring evil and harm ; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
It's bard to he Ibveless and childless, 
When wrinkles are deep on the brow; 
And hair has grown aged and whitened, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and helpless, 
With none to protect us from harm, 
We only can suffer in silence, 
Or tearfully mortgage the farm.

Where the waters gently flowing, 
Near a 
handsome little cot; 
Dwells a 
lovely little maiden, 
A 
charming sweet forget-me-not. 
She has large blue eyes and golden hair, 
And a 
pretty set of teeth; 
Who has promised for to meet me, 
'Where the roses fall asleep.

CHORUS. 
Oh! my, she is so charming, (Sym) 
She is such a 
darling, (Sym) 
I 
have promised for to meet her, 
And I'll tell her, that I'll wed her, 
Where the roses fall asleep. 
She is so charming and so merry, 
And she meets me with a 
smile; 
This lovely little blue-eyed maiden, 
I 
know that she does love me all the while. 
And when I 
do meet this-bud, 
I 
will tell her something sweet, 
Which will make her heart feel gladened, 
Where the roses fall asleep.

In the early hours of morning, 
O'er the waves we swiftly go, 
Heedless of the sailor's warning. 
Where the foam-c:ipped billows flow; 
For this hour we long have waited, 
And the charms within our reach. 
Make our hearts with joy elated, 
Off for Coney Island Beach. 
CHORUS. 
Some may sail across the ocean, 
Which is far beyond our reach, 
While we find enough commotion, 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
Many pleasures now surround us, 
On this breezy summer day. 
And with charming friends around us, 
O'er the waves we speed away, 
Till we reach that isle of gladness, 
Which is just within our teach, 
Where we banish all our sadness, 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
In the chilling surf we shiver, 
But o ,r 
hearts are light and free, 
While the wavelets dance and quiver, 
Rolling in from depths of sea. 
And the breeze is softly blowing, 
All our lonely ones should teach, 
That the wise much bliss are knowing, 
Down on Coney Island Beach..

In a 
rustic woodland green, 
Where violets sweetly bloom, 
Neath a 
shady arbor sweet, 
One lovely day in June. 
Strolling just for pleasure 
Down in a 
quiet nook, 
I 
met my hearts delight there, 
On the bridge that crosses the brook. 
CHORUS. 
She's the fairest one I've seen, 
My pretty daisy little queen ; 
I'll ne'er forget that day, - 
The pleasant walk we took, 
When I 
met my heart's delight, 
On the bridge that crosses the brook. 
We talk( d 
and laughed togethor, 
She smiled on me so sweet, 
I 
blushed, my heart did flutter, 
When our eyes did meet, 
I 
told her that I 
loved her, 
She thanked me with a 
smile, 
Now together we do cherish—yes, 
The bridge that crosses the brook.

I'm the maid that knows my business, 
For dear mamma always said, 
That in fashion's ways and flirting, 
Daughter had a 
level head. 
And the lesson that she taught me, 
Ere I 
learned to read and spell, 
Was to be a 
star of fashion, 
And the charming up-town belle. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! I'm the star of fashion, 
And I 
love to flirt so well; 
Mamma says my head is level, 
I'm a 
charming up-town belle. 
I'm a 
dashing maid of fashion, 
And for fortune's smiles I 
grieve; 
Only dresses that are finest, 
Doth my aching heart relieve. 
And to go to balls and parties, 
With the robes once worn before, 
/ Would be a 
gloom to all my sunshine, 
I 
could be a 
belle no more. 
I'm a 
darling in flirtations, 
Just the maid who knows her place, 
You will find me kind and loving, 
With the charin of faultless grace, 
I 
am just what mamma made me, 
And you know her taste so well, 
She will call my style perfection, 
For a 
eharmins, up-town belle.

Don't shit out the moonlight, mallet. 
Let each silver- lighted beam 
Softly on my dying pillow. 
In a 
flood of twenty stream, 
Let it shed its radi ,int lustre, 
On my feeble fluttering breast, 
Let it bathe in in its brightness, 
Ere I 
pass away to rest. 
CHORUS. 
Don't shut out the moonlight, mother, 
Let each silver lighted beam, 
Softly o'er my dying pillow, 
In a 
flood of beauty stream. 
Don't shut out the moonlight, mother, 
I 
have ever loved that light, 
And have gazed for hours together, 
In some still andisolemn night. 
On the pale moon slowly floating, 
O'er the starry home on high, 
Dreaming of that land of plenty, 
Far beyond the azure sky. 
Don't shut out the moonlight meths; 
Let it beam on me onee more, 
Let it light me through the valley, 
To that far off peaceful shore. 
And when I 
am coldly lying 
in that last long dreamless sleep, 
Lay me where the silver alooniseause 
Sealy o'er my grave will .seep.

Our good ship ploughs the trackless deep, 
As in our hammocks low we swing. 
The larboard watch lone vigils keep, 
While jolly tars their love songs sing. 
The waves are calm, the sky is blue, 
We idly wait for foam capped swells, 
Ill comes the call of weary crew, 
First watch on deck, eight bells, eight bells. 
CHORUS. 
As o'er the deep blue waves we go, 
We watch the sea for foam capped swells; 
Till loudly comes the mates call slow, 
All hands on deck, eight bells, eight bells. 
We ride the waves without a 
fear, 
And watch the unknown depths below, 
Or dream of days that brought us cheer, 
And idly swing in hammocks slow. 
Our home is on the deep blue sea, 
We take no heed of angry swells; 
A 
crew of jolly tars are we, 
When comes the call, eight bells, eight bells. 
Cho. 
We speed o'er billows white with foam, 
A 
hundred fathoms deep, or more; 
The restless sea we call our home, 
And feel as safe as on the shore. 
We take in sail when tempests break, 
So we may safely ride the swells, 
And then the merry tars we wake, 
Last watch on deck, eight bells, eight bells. 
Cho. 
We love our life upon the sea, 
When calm the waves, or tempest torn; 
A 
crew of jolly tars are we, 
No sailor lives a 
life forlorn. 
Our good ship rides the billows deep, 
Ai.d brings us safe o'er foam-capped waves, 
When toil is o'er, how sweet our sleep, 
'Till culled OA deck, eight bells, eight bells.
