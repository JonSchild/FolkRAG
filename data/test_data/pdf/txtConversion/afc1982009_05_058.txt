programs began to be prepared and the latter pages of book 2 are 
have been microfilmed by a

Mr Nichols likes to make things out of wood. He has built sections of his 
house and furniture in it, incl cabinets and a table or two. He and 
his son are presently rebuilding and converting n log tobacco curing 
barn into a little 16 ft square log house on sane of his son's 
property. They had to work through XM an architect to get the 
building permit ($25 to redraw and sign plans). The permit ins ector 
or building code enforcer (don't know which jurisdiction) told them 
Nichols - 8-20 page 2 
that "poplar" was notXXXXXIMME 
a tested wood and that 
they woi-ild have to use more beams, or closer together, than they wanted. 
The architect, for simiiBir reasons, asked them not to use fieldshones 
for the foundation^ but to use cement blocks. Mr Nichols, 
"Boys, I'JJltell you, the pioneers wouldn't stand a chance." 
Mr Nichols gave us a ball puzzle he makes with a pocket 
He couldn't 82£XX remember exactly where he learned it. 
"Must have seen it sdaewhere when I ZE2Z was a boy."

Q&&irR£m$miA Higgins, 
I apologize for taking so long to get the fox hound pictures 
to you, but two things consXpired to slow me down. And, as you 
can see, when I finally got these in the mail X didn't have 
your address before me -- T assume they reached you in good 
order. 
I had trouble getting the prints made. As you learned in 
the case of the pictures from the church service, we usually 
aet custom prints from a special lab for about three dollars 
each. This guarantees us good results and protects the 
negatives from injury at the hands of careless workers. Still, 
I have always wished ta> find a cheaper way and I thought I would 
experiment.with these pictures so your friends could re-order at 
a lower price. So, I sent them to a lab that charges about 500 
a print. As you can see, some of the pirnts are Oh, but others 
are just so-so, and one is dreadfully bad, I rejected them, but 
they were returned MtKtfjSa without improvement. 1 will try again 
another place, out I thought I should send you these without 
further delay. 
The second thing that slowed me down was my travelling. As 
you see I sent this letter from Utah, having started organizing 
the pictures in_Chicago. 1 imagine that as you read this I will 
be back in v/ashington. I only hope that the pictures reach you 
in time to still be of value. 
1 wonder if you and some of your feiends at the club could help 
me get the names of the dogs and their ov/ners. 1 know you will 
not know all oi the information -- please do not worry about that-- 
but I will be grateful for whatever you can provide. Keep the photos 
of course, but checl the numbers on the back. They corresT'ond to 
numbers on the lists, where you can write in the information that 
youri can easXily recall. I have enclosed a self-stamped, self- 
addressed envelope. 
I hope you and your family are all doing fine. We are busy 
organizing the materials we collected and thank you and your* 
friends for all their help and cooperation during our visits. 
Very truly yours.
