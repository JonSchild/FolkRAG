MEMORANDUM
 
June 30, 1982
 
To:  Florence Lowe
 
From:  Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Subject:  Caroline Adams
 
The Wall Street Journal lady telephoned me and asked when we could talk
 
substantively about Endowment affairs, specifically questions concerning
; the
 
budget, my impressions of the Chairman, and how the agency as a whole was
 
getting along.  I said I was just back from a lengthy series of out of town
 
site visits and was not up-to-date-on budgetary considerations, and that,
 
though I did not wish to seem evasive or uncooperative, I was extremely busy
 
with the new Heritage Fellowship program and would appreciate her deferring
 
our conversation for a week or so.  I also recommended that she get in touch
 
with the Public Information office and I think, though I
'm not absolutely
 
positive, that she said she either already had or that she would.
 
I think a memo from you giving a written outline as to hvw we are to handle
 
requests from media people and reporters would be helpful.  There are lots of
 
new staff and even us old tired ones get doubtful
. sometimes.  For example,
 
I just gave 1
4FTA attape recorded interview on the Heritage Fellowships, and
 
I know I will be asked on the mall for more.  Should I tell you before or
 
after or both?  I also attach a copy of Aa VOA program that I was interviewed
 
for.  My general rule of thumb has been that I would take care of (
while
 
letting your office know) substantive enquiries about Folk Arts per se, as
 
long as they weren't fiscally speculative, while referring general Endowment
 
queries upstairs.

There has been some confusion and misunderstanding about queries
 
from Caroline Adams, an intern/reporter in the Washington bureau
 
of the WALL STREET JOURNAL.
 
The confusion stems from an internal matter of jurisdiction which
 
concerns only the publication,  and not the Endowment.
 However,  the
 
problem  has been exacerbated by the fact that at least five
 
program directors have spoken with Caroline Adams without clearing
 
the query with this office.
 This is standard procedure and should
 
be strictly observed.
 We have a reputation for credibility
 
and for accessibility.
 Nevertheless there are many reasons for
 
coordinating all media contacts through this office.
 
I shall be arranging meetings with each program and division in the
 
near future to discuss this and set up a system for clearance.
 
Meantime,  the WALL STREET JOURNAL has made this assignment and we
 
are obligated to cooperate in a responsible and factually correct
 
way.
 Cynthia Saltzman,  the arts reporter in the New York office,
 
informs me we have no alternative.
 She will pursue the idea for
 
her feature at a later date.
 
Caroline Adams has spoken with the following:
 Senator Pell,
 
Liv Biddle,  Representative Yates and "five Endowment program directors.
 
If the latter can fill me in on her questions it will be helpful.
 
I gather she was trying to get information on "how a man without arts
 
experience is viewed by the staff of the Endowment."
 (Her words)
 
I am sending her some substantive and constructive background on the
 
Chairman.
 She will probably interview him sometime next week.
 
Please let me know if she makes further attempts to interview other
 
staff members.
 
Thank you.

Subject:  Improving Information now
 
A f
ew additional remarkst
 
1
)  A lot of people feel Folic Arts needs a casual xeroxe?d working
 
newsletter that would circulate anong s
t state folk arts coordinators and
 
others working in this field.  Fach bi-monthly Issue
:* could include brief
 
reports on successful projects, requests for special information, announce-
ments of particular projects lists of useful sources, analyses of projects
 
that didn't work well, etc.  Such a newsletter could be produced by the
 
Polk Arts Program or by an oryaniration such as the National Council on the
 
Traditio n) Arts through a contract or grant.  I would tend to favor a one-
year pilot non-matching grant as t
he cleanest route, maybe $6,100.  The
 
subscription list should be a little exclusive, limited to perhaps 100 with
 
an eventual subscription fee of $
5.10 or so.  Vithin a year, it could hell
,
 
be solf-sustaining, if i
t wore well done.  Such a publication would help us
 
with camatunication both to and from the field.  It should eventually
_ extend
 
to Humanities, Cultural Preservation people any; the like,
 
2
)  I b
 e
ve been pleas ed a
.rd surprised w?th the Interest in t
he Folk
 
Arts Program penearaated by the Veritage Vellowship announcements.  Feople
 
I haven't heard from in years have written in, and the pbone s
 are junpinp.
 
I notice that Media Arts uses t
he ploy of settinq up small new catee7orieas
 
or announcing special efforts a
a
lnost every year.  As any good conversationalist
 
knows:  if you h
axva somethinr interesting and unhackneyeed to say, people
 
want to talk to you.  I really think that rather than focussing on tryine
 
to get particular groups interested in our conversation, we should concentrate
 
on wave to he more interesting.
 
3
)  rinaally, I really a
im not sure that s
imply increasing communication
 
is our biggest need.  At least as important Is h
ens to cope with the
 
cormuni
.cation that's already couln  in.  Fcrsonaally, I get about as much
 
information per any s
ea I can ehsorh, and I beep on losing track of that.
 
I do think some nanaarement techniques for helping staff cope with information
 
storage and retrieval would be very useful.  Finally, there is no possibility
 
that much more of anything can he done v1th staff levels the war they are.
 
We are already pushing our Units.

Though the bill has been improved, it seems highly unlikely that it will be
 
vigorously supported during a period of federal cutback.  However, I still
 
agree with the high-lighted sentences, and wonder if you might want to use
 
the gist of them in your reply.  You could also use your "bully pulpit"
 
strategy to commend:
 
a

 the work of the North American Indian Museum Association, a boot-
strap self-help organization formed a few years ago to swap technical and
 
moral support around among the small struggling tribal museums so frequent
 
on Indian reservations and communities.
 It's an all-Indian effort and the
 
idea is much to be congratulated, I think.
 
b

 the work of the Smithsonian's Anthropological Archives whose
 
director, Herman Viola, has long operated a program to bring in American
 
Indian museum and cultural officers for a few weeks' intensive training
 
in archiving techniques, storage and display methods for Indian art objects,
 
how to set up an effective exhibit, and how to locate information on tribal
 
cultural materials at the Library of Congress, the National Archives and
 
other federal repositories.
 This is an essential and exclusive federal
 
function, and I
've never met an Indian who didn't give it the highest praise.
 
(
Viola's tiny annual budget invariably gets cut back when the annual fiscal
 
crisis occurs; it's just not a very visible program, so I always try to give
 
it a plug when I can.)  You may, of course, feel it's inappropriate to comment

Senate bill 2166 "To promote the development of Native
 
American culture and art"
 
Larry Chernikoff
 
1
.  The Arts Endowment should support the aims and purposes of this bill.  The
 
preamble i
s first-class and entirely in con,,i
onance with our own agency goals.
 
2
.  There are, however, a number of problems with the bill as spelled out:
 
a
.
 It has no institutional or agency base.  If conceived of as
 
a separate agency entirely on its own, it will need physicnl space
 
and overhead and administrative funds in quantity.  If it is conceived
 
of-as an adjunct within the Smithsonian or the L
ibrary of Congress,
 
support costs might be less but congruence with the aims and purposes
 
of the host agency must t
hen be established.
 
b.  Section 4 (
b) was written in line with the pattern of the Board
 
of the American Folklife Center.  This was a mistake; the AFC Board
 
has been a disaster.  To extrapolate the problems onto this bill,
 
there are seven Board members from federal
. agencies:  Interior, Education,
 
Smithsonian, NFA,-1TJI, Library of Congress and t
he President of the
 
Institute itself.  As a federal representative on the American Folklife
 
Center Board, I find it extremely awkward to be a voting
; board member
 
within another federal agency.  Representatives of other federal agencies
 
should sit on this Board in an advisory capacity only and should not vote.
 
If this change is not made, I must point out that the Board will undoubtedly
 
be controlled by an Anglo majority, since the twelve Presidential appointees
 
need only include seven Native Americans,  (
a majority of the Public
 
sector group).
 I also query whether a working voting board of twelve is
 
big enough to "provide an appropriate regional and tribal representation
 
on the Board" (
p. 4
, lines 1
.2 and 13).
 I should think a group of fifteen
 
would be better (
assuming t
he federal representatives don't vote).
 
c
.  The list of potential activities on page 8 are nifty but seem
 
unrealistic in the light of the total funding suggested on p
. 10, line 24.
 
American Indian Arts an,1 Crafts hoard (
now in Interior) and the Institute
 
for American Indian Arts in Santa Fe are scheduled, according to this
 
bill, to be t
ransferred into the Institute (
see p
. 9
, Sec. 6
).  Their
 
current combined budgets are in the neighborhood of $3,000,000, leaving
 
only a million to start a Native American art museum, set up a canter
 
for American Indian scholars, begin an inter-American Indian exchange
 
program and a
ll the rest.

FROM:

.1 Counsel for Management
 
SUBJECT:
 S.  792,  Native American Culture  and Art Development Act
 
We have just received a request from the office of Management
 
and Budget to comment on the above referenced bill.
 Comments
 
can be transmitted verba
.11y.
 
This bill would provide for the establishment of an Institute
 
of Native American Culture and Arts Development, which would
 
be under the direction and control of a Board of Trustees.
 
The Board would be composed of eighteen members including:
 
"(1)  twelve members appointed by the President of the
 
United States from among individuals from private life
 
who a
.re Native Americans widely recognized in the field
 
of Native American art and culture;
 
(
2)  Secretary
 
(
3)  Secretary
 
(
4)  Secretary
 
designee);
 
of the Interior  (or his designee);
 
of Education  (or his designee);
 
of the Smithsonian Institution  (or his
 
(
5)  Chairman,  National Endowment of the Arts  (or his
 
designee);
 
(
6)  Chairman,  National Endowment of the Humanities  (or his
 
designee);  and
 
(
7)  Librarian of Congress  (
or his designee)."  (
Sections 4 and E.
 
-2-
The terms of office of each member of the Board would be staggered
 
and would not exceed six years  (
Section 5(c)).
 
The functions of the Institute would include the establishment of
 
a
. Center for Culture and Art Studies,  a
. Center for Native American
 
Scholars,  a Center for Cultural Exchange,  and a
. Museum of Native
 
American Arts.
 In addition,  the Institute would be authorized to
 
develop such centers and programs as the Board deems necessary to:
 
"(1)  foster research and scholarship in Native American
 
art and culture;
 
(
2)  complement existing tribal programs for the advancement
 
of Native America
.n art and culture;  and
 
(
3)  coordinate efforts to preserve,  support,  revitalize and
 
disseminate Native American art and culture.  (
Sections 7(a
.)
 
and  (
b).)
 .
 
In addition,  under Section 5(f)  the Boa
.rd is authorized to solicit,
 
accept,  and dispose of gifts, bequests,  etc.  for the benefit of the
 
Institute.
 
There is no express gra
.ntmaking authority provided.
 However,  the
 
purpose of the various Centers and the Museum is to support and
 
develop research programs,  fellowship programs,  publications,
 
promotional efforts,  and the acquisition and exchange of Native
 
American art.
 Presumably,  these activities would have to be
 
carried out by grants and/or contracts.
 Any comment to OMB should
 
point this out.
 
Appropriations would be authorized in the amount of $4,000,000 for
 
fiscal  '
83.
 (
Section 13.)
 
Traditionally,  the Endowment ha
.s opposed the creation of separate
 
funding entities for specific art forms.
 (Our Folk Arts Program
 
already supports such a
.ctivities,  albeit on a smaller sca
.le.)
 We
 
could oppose on the basis of duplication of Federal programs.
 OMB
 
would probably agree.
 
We should communicate our basic attitude on this bill to OMB by
 
May 13. 
Would you like to briefly discuss?

RE
 I
IODSOLL t
lEMO OF APRIL 16
  
I
' ve been out on some site visits and apologize for responding
 
so late.
 My main problem is with the Analysis of Programs chart on
 
Page two.
 In Column D (Chief source of support,  in order)  "Non-
Mainstream" art is thought to be supported as follows:
 
Private
 
Local
 
Federal
 
State
 
I
' m not totally clear what these terms mean.
 If "Private" means
 
the philanthropic efforts of private foundations and businesses,
 
Folk Arts  (and possibly Expansion Arts too)  would have to list
 
this as the last resource rather than the first.
 If it means
 
"self-support" on the other hand,  then it is indeed the first.
 
The majority of folk arts activities take place without any
 
outside support at all.
 My own preference would be to order the
 
list:
 
Local  (
including self-support)
 
Federal
 
State
 
Private
 
as a reflection of the present-day reality.
 If our folk arts coordinate
 
efforts survives the current hard times,  we could perhaps move the
 
states up even farther.
 
Finally,  I
' m not terribly turned on by the term "non-mainstream."
 
It's always discouraging to be defined by a negative,  and besides,
 
I think folk and expansion arts are mainstream, maybe more main-
stream than a lot of the other d
c
i
siplines.
  
I mean,  is Laurie
 
Anderson "mainstream"?
 
I don't exactly know what to suggest instead,  of course.
 "Populist
 
arts" has bad overtones to some.
 "Indigenous" - maybe?

SUBJECT:
 Policy Guidance for FY 1984:
 Draft for Discussion
 
This is to seek your thoughts on potential policy directions as
 
we develop our FY 84 budget.
 This paper  is part of an initial
 
phase of determining directions for the FY 84 budget.
 
Background 
On April 9
,  the Policy Office submitted to the Chairman a state-
ment of three objectives for FY 84,  accompanied by the attached
 
Endowment Approach to Objectives.  
The Chairman then developed his list of potential priorities for
 
FY 1984,  shared with the Policy Committee on April 13 and described
 
more fully in his memo of April 16, Budget Priorities for FY 1984
 
(
attached).
 
The Policy Office has now
 
priorities with the three
 
The Chairman's priorities
 
effort.
 
attempted to integrate the Chairman's
 
general objectives we developed April 9
.
 
have been modified slightly in this
 
The Chairman's thinking on these matters is still evolving.
 Some
 
of you will undoubtedly have different ideas,  as well as questions
 
about the impact this definition of priorities will have on your
 
Program and on the Agency as a whole.
 
It is understood that these objectives and priorities would be
 
addressed in a number of different ways:
 through Program planning,
 
instructions to panelists,  revision of guidelines,  and where
 
applicable,  through funding category allocations in the FY 1984
 
budget.
 
I would be interested to hear your thinking on these objectives
 
and priorities -- do they apply to your Program?
 Do they make
 
sense for the Endowment?
 Have we missed some key priorities?
 
I
'd be eager to get your thoughts,  even before we all have an
 
opportunity to take up these issues with the Chairman.
 I stress
 
that this is only a beginning and your thinking is needed.

Objectives and Priorities
  
In FY 1984 the Endowment will assist,  through advocacy and support,
 
the following general objectives in order of priority:
 
A.
 Continued vitality and excellence in the arts of America
  
through encouragement of the creation, performance,  and
  
preservation of outstanding art.
 
B.
 Improved overall financial stability of American arts  
organizations.
 
C.
 Enhanced appreciation of art via broadened and more informed
  
audiences.
 
The following priorities  (which refer largely to Objective A)
 
should be reflected in the 1984 Fiscal Year.
 
Priorities
 
1
.
 Support for arts organizations for experimentation and other
 
activities which advance the field beyond established
 
artistic criteria.
 
2
.
 Support for individual artists to develop their capacity to
 
create art of the highest quality in the nation.
 
3
.
 Support for arts organizations of the highest quality in the
 
nation.
 
4.
 Support for art that will enhance our aesthetic and cultural
 
diversity.
 
5
.
 Support for general education.
 
6
.
 Support to quality arts organizations,  touring,  exhibits,
 
residencies,  and media to encourage wider access to the
 
arts.
 
7
.
 Support for professional training.
 
8
.
 Support for service activities which assist the fields.
 
Commentary on Objectives and Priorities
  
The three objectives will be addressed in different order by I

 Challenge/Advancement/Private
 
Sector and III)  Partnership:
 States/Regions/Locals.

 Programs
  
For the Programs, Objective A is primary, especially in the
 
context of this budget exercise.
 That is, while Programs
 
will be developing their strategies to improve the overall
 
financial stability of arts organizations  (B)  and to enhance
 
appreciation of art via broadened and more informed audiences
 
(
C)  as part of their long-term plans, the priorities issued
 
for guidance in the development of the Programs' FY 1984
 
budgets focus primarily on Objective A (
priorities 303 and
 
W ) .
 1
- 4
 
7- 8
 
The access priorities  (
411 MMkbb)  which are in a relatively low
 
position within Objective A, are of great importance to the
 
Agency and will be addressed primarily through the Partnership
 
Office.
 
Each Program will be asked to indicate what planning it
 
intends to undertake with the States and Regions to sustain
 
and develop touring, exhibition travel, and other access
 
activities.
 
II.
 Partnership:
 Challenge/Advancement/Private Sector
  
This area is primarily concerned with Objective B.
 However,
 
its guidelines, plans,  and budget projections must be
 
developed so as to enhance the other two objectives as well.
 
That is,  the improved stability of American arts organizations
 
will be undertaken in order to assure the continued vitality
 
and excellence of the arts in America and to encourage enhanced
 
appreciation and access; guidelines, plans, and budget
 
projections must reflect those objectives.
 
Priorities
  
1
.
 
Organizations of high artistic quality capable of
 
managing a major fundraising drive leading to improved
 
programming
 
2
.
 Organizations of high artistic quality in an early
 
phase of institutional development
 
3
.
 State arts agencies
 
III.
 Partnership:
 States/Regions/Locals
  
The other sectors of the public art support network use Endowment
 
funds to address a wide range of objectives, defined at the
 
recipient's level with those funds that are distributed according
 
to formula.
 Further development of this funding area in FY 1984
 
will focus primarily on Objective C:
 efforts undertaken in
 
joint planning with the States/Regions/Locals to enhance
 
appreciation of art via broadened and more informed audiences.

Endowment Approach to Objectives
  
To achieve these objectives,  the Endowment will serve primarily
 
as a catalyst.
 The FY  '
84 budget,  then, will reflect an increased
 
emphasis on the Endowment's role as a catalyst.
 Historically,
 
the Endowment has served this role; with limited growth potential,
 
its effort must be even more sharply focussed to enhance this
 
catalytic function -- this ability to stimulate developments  in
 
the world of art.
 
Historically,  the Endowment has served as a catalyst in numerous
 
ways:
 
stimulating the creation of new art through support for
 
individual artists who might not have been able to
 
produce without such support,  or whose efforts might
 
have flagged without timely external validation;  and
 
through guideline emphasis on the production and performance
 
of new work.
 
stimulating collaborations among artists and art forms.
 
developing new audiences by touring of artists  (e.g.  dance)
 
enhancing training opportunities through joint ventures
 
(e.g.  Exxon young conductors).
 
stimulating local support for the arts through the
 
funding of state arts agencies.
 
bringing new funders to institutions through such mechanisms
 
as the Challenge Program.
 
stimulating art through advocacy within the Federal government.
 
In this catalytic fashion,  the Federal government has demonstrated
 
its concern for the health and vitality of art in America.
 In
 
recent years,  Endowment funds have accounted for less than 5% of
 
funding for the arts,  but through its imaginative approach to
 
providing this support,  as well as through its posture as a
 
Federal agency,  the Endowment has been able to exercise proportionately
 
more than a 5% influence.
 
In a time of reduced funding,  this ability to catalyze support,
 
new idea collaboration,  creativity,  and broader appreciation
 
becomes more critical,  perhaps,  than at any time in the Endowment's
 
history.

Budget Priorities for FY 1984
 
At the April 13 meeting of the Policy Committee of the National
 
Council, we began discussion of priorities for the Endowment's FY
 
1984 budget.
 The attached chart, Analysis of Programs and the
 
memo summarizing previous Endowment budget priorities were shared
 
with the Committee.
 
The Analysis chart, which grew out of my review of Endowment
 
grants, Program by Program,  represents possible priorities as follows:
 
1
.
 Experimental and Individual Creativity. 
Included here are
 
programs and categories providing grants for Fellowships
 
and innovative projects by individuals, as well as project
 
applications from institutions which focus on innovative,
 
projects.
 
2
.
 Nationally Recognized Institutions. 
This includes the
 
leading orchestras, museums, dance companies, etc., whose
 
quality has been consistently recognized by Endowment
 
panels for the last several years.
 
3
.
 General Education. 
This refers to efforts which provide
 
arts education to the public; currently includes AIE, as
 
well as specific projects found among the various
 
disciplines.
 
4
.
 Non-mainstream Arts. 
This area refers to art outside the
 
classic European traditions; currently includes activities
 
funded by Expansion Arts and Folk Arts, among others.
 
5
.
 Other Arts Presence. 
Refers to support for the work of
 
arts organizations not nationally recognized and the
 
activities we fund to make the arts available  (
e.g.,
 
touring,  residencies, media).
 
1
 
Q
I
C�
 
2
 
6
.
 Professional Training for Artists. 
This area refers to
 
activities for training of professional artists.
 
Columns B and C are self-explanatory.
 Column D indicates my rough
 
sense of where the major support for each of these priorities is
 
located  (
e.g., General Arts Education is primarily funded at the
 
local and state levels).
 
In order to give the Committee and staff the chance to review and
 
consider these priorities,  it was decided that Committee members
 
would write and share their thoughts with Kate Moore's office
 
(
policy,  Planning & Research)  within a week of the policy Committee
 
mcating.
 We would, of course, welcome the ideas of Council members
 
who were not present at the meeting, as well.
 
We will bring the results of this exchange to the May meeting of the
 
Council, where the development of priorities for FY 1984 will be
 
discussed.

^se of this paper is to identify Endowment budget priorities
 
:ron
'i`i y '979 to the present,  indicate the source of those priorities,
 
describe how they influenced the development of the budgets in question
 
and rote how those priorities were institutionalized at the EndoWrrent.
 
Recommendation
  
fore of the previous budget preparations really serves as an adequate
 
model for the development of policy guidance for FY 1984.
 The budgets
 
or the FY 1979 through the 1982 Carter budget all were developed in
 
the expectation of budget growth;  the revised FY 1982 and FY 1983
 
budgets sought, in general,  to maintain historical proportions as muc . 
as possible, within relatively small policy-directed shifts.
 
Moreover, the limitations on Endowment staff .
ceilings,  the unlikely
 
prospects of significantly increased administrative funds,  the need
 
for additional staff travel money as the rest of the program Directors
 
come on board all create limiting conditions that must aff_ct our
 
^Nina about objectives for FY 1984, or at least the means for their
 
attainment.
  
Overall observations

Institutions were to be assisted via two approaches.
 1
)  Increased
 
funds for the Challenge Grant Program, where the future of Advance-
ment and the shape of Second Challenge were under discussion.
 
2
)  Increases in regular Program activities.
 Of particular concern
 
to the Council Committees was support to institutions that directly
 
or indirectly made the arts available.
 The Programs'  improved 
level request was to reflect the emphasis on assistance to institutions.
 
The FY 1982 Budget request was submitted to OMB in September,  1982
 
at a level of $199.1 million; the first Congressional FY 1982
 
submission prepared by the Endowment requested $175 million and
 
included $18.5 million for the Challenge Program and an increase
 
of $13.0 million across Programs lar ge ly for  the benefit of
 
institutions.
 
FY 1982 (Reagan budget)
 
In developing its plan to meet a 50% reduction in sc
_ending frcm
 
132 budget of 5175 million, the Council,
 
management and staff of the Endowment developed priorities
 for
 
what was seen as an emergency year, =n
.tended to sustain at the
 
proposed $83 million level those programs and categories which
 
assist and prc-
rcte
 
-  cro=essionalism and excellence
 
-  organizations which produce art and whose primary
 
concern is focused on the arts themselves
 
-  individual artists
 
At the $88 million level all activities were seriously affected;
 
supporting outreach and touring activities were reduced in favor
 
of funding intended to maintain the artistic excellence and
 
stab
 ty of the arts-producing organizations.
 
These shifts were made,  for the most part, by the Programs
 
themselves;  funding categories were elirrinated or consolidated
 
in some cases; allocations between them were shifted.
 In general,
 
efforts were made to preserve the historic proportionality in
 
funding among the Programs, even at the reduced level, but la mer
 
cuts were made in the case of AIr,  Inter-Arts, Media Arts,  an C
:
 
State Programs.
 
At its Marc.,  1981 meeting, t- National Council made some
 
recommendations on the basis of informal consensus
 to shi=t
 
funds from one Program to another; as a result,  funding for AIE
 
and Media Arts was increased slightly;  funding for *esicn Arts
 
and In
.-er-Arts decreased s

catecori
 
FY 1980  
In 1978,  the new Deputy Chairman for Programs came to the
 
Endowment with a strong commitment to increase funding for
 
artists.
 
Support for artist fellowships was only one of th e areas
 
identified for increases in FY 1980 by the Council's Budget
 
Committee in June,  1978.
 Other areas proposed for Council
 
consideration were Institutions  (
$12.5 million increase), Touring
 
(
$3.3 million)  and Expansion Arts Institution Building  (
$1.5 million);
 
$2 million was the figure suggested for increased fellowship support.
 
The FY 1980 Budget was the first that used the 1978 Goals
 
Statement as a basis for budget presentation.
 
instructions to Programs for budget development identified
 
increased funding for artists as a :
major t
'h
.eme for t
_
-he FY 1980
 
budget.
 :
jot  all Programs served individual artists directly;  t:
_e
 
instructions  did,  however,  tend to  elici t budget just_ficatiOP
.S
 
for  ins titut ional categories  that focused  on  the  bene f its  they
 
indirectly conferred on artists.
 '
Naturally, Programs ide.^
.ti_
`ied
 
other areas of emphasis as well.
 +
 
Programs were not assigned a figure for the improved level for
 
the preparation of their TY 1980 budget requests, but were
 
instructed to request what they needed for each of their
 
f•
 o
 th e Programs'
 
funding categories.  Management  then rev iewed �
.
 
budget requests, approving some and reducing others;  the
 
total requested by the Programs exceeded the $188.0 million to
 
be requested of OMB.
 Major fellowship category increases were
 
focused on Visual arts  ( which was funding about 7% at an inadequate
 
grant amount.
 
The Congressional budget for FY 1980 requested only a 3% increase
 
over the previous fiscal year,  in a budget that identified Individual
 
artists as the first priority, but also focused on institutional
 
sl
l=cort  Lor  Theater  and  Music,  Support  for  Theater tc u
 ng, an
al
 
succort for developing organizations in the Expansicn arts area
 
(through  t.^
.e  Treas ury  Fund)  in  what  would  beco me  the  Advance ment
 
Program in FY 1981.
 
The FY 1980 appropriation of $154.6 million doubled the amount
 
available for Visual Arts fellowships.
 (
It is interesting to

available in that category, chose on the basis of application

 Summary of Policy Committee Discussion,  4/13/82
  
a

Belcw is a capsule review of discussion of the agenda items of
 
the April 13, meeting of the Policy Committee of the National
 
Council on the Arts,  for the benefit of those of you who were
 
unable to attend.

The Chairman brought the Council up-to-date
 
on the status of the President's Committee
 
on the Arts and Humanities, which will proceed
 
through Executive Order, rather than legislation,
 
and which incorporates the Council's sucaested
 
language that addressed the concerns raised at
 
the February meeting of the National Council of
 
the Arts.
 
The Chairman described the three Seminars held
 
so far,  (Design Arts, Music, States/Locals),
 
noting that they have been helpful and will
 
provide issues for policy panel discussion.
 He
 
noted that two more have been scheduled,  for
 
Media  (
June 18-19, St. Paul, Minn.)  and Theater
 
(
July 16-17, New York)
 
Michael Pittas summarized the points made at
 
the Design Seminar, which had urged increased
 
attention to the Program's advocacy role,  and
 
presented to the Committee the issues outlined
 
for discussion by the Design Arts policy panel.
 
The Chairman noted that the examination of "who
 
does what best" and of options for support of the
 
work of the local arts agencies :
rust continue
 
and produce results within a year.
 
Anthony Turney described the recent charges in
 
the State Program Guidelines, noting the
 
elimination of the "
 .old harmless" provision.
 
The Committee indicated an interest in
 N
 
knowing the states' reaction, but Anthony Turney
 
noted it was too early to know;  the NASAA Board
 
will meet later in April and will probably
 
provide a response.
 
The Committee indicated its interest in
 
retaining the criterion that the State Arts
 
Agencies should act as advocates on behalf of
 
the arts, a criterion the States Policy Panel
 
had proposed eliminating.
 
Expansion Arts 
Revised FY 1984 guidelines for the Expansion
 
Arts Program were discussed; the purpose of
 
the changes was to explain more clearly what
 
the Program would support.
 The Committee
 
recommended reconsideration of a number of the
 
changes, among these, the elimination of
 
support for entry-level classes and workshops
 
and for pilot projects.
 The completed revisions,
 
incorporating the suggestions of the Committee,
 
will be sent to Expansion Arts'  special policy
 
panel, for recommendations to be taken to the
 
May Council.
 
International 
Current ideas to develop International
 
Activities 
activities on an advocacy basis were presented
 
to the Committee.
 The status of ongoing work
 
with the ICA was reviewed; suggestions for
 
improving our arts exposure abroad were
 
provided by the Committee.
 It was suggested
 
that film might be an area of emphasis.
 
Budget/Appropriation 
Larry Chernikoff brought the Committee up-to-date
 
update 
on the anticipated FY 1983 budget process.
 The
 
Hearing dates are set for April 2i on the Senate
 
side; May 19 in the House.
 On May 21, the House
 
will conduct its outside witness hearings.
 
FY 1984 Budget
  
Guidance/Goals
  
Civil Rights
  
The Chairman presented his analysis of major
 
Endowment funding areas, and requested the
 
Committee's suggestions for budget priorities
 
for the development of the FY 1984 budget.
 The
 
attached chart, Analysis of Programs, and memo
 
reviewing previous Endowment cu
m  
ad et priorities
 
were distributed to the Committee.
 Committee
 
members were invited to send their suggestions
 
by mail;  the development of FY 1984 budget
 
oriorities will be discussed with the Council
 
in May.
 
The status of Endowment plans to implement
 
como
_liance with Title VI of the Civil Rights
 
Act of 1964 on the part of grantees was
 
reviewed with the Committee.
 
Regional
  
Representatives
  
Challenge Update
  
Advertising Council
  
Panels
  
The Committee discussed the findings of the
 
report on the Regional Representatives prograa.:
 
and voiced its concerns about the future
 
of the program.
 A final decision must be made
 
in May.
 
Liz Weil described the progress of her plans
 
to develop projects with the private sector.
 
Details will be presented to the Council in
 
August, together with fully developed plans
 
for the Challenge Program.
 
Marvin Liebman described plans to develop
 
an advertising campaign focusing on support
 
for the arts at the local level  (memo attacted).
 
John Clark described for the Committee the
 
timetable for review of present oeprations of
 
the panel system,  the issues that need to be
 
considered in determining panel structure,  and
 
some options for consideration.
 The Chairman
 
emphasized that all chances will be tailored to
 
the specific needs of individual Programs.

Lear Ma. Hellnan:
 
I r
e,greet t
he delay in responding
. t
o your letter of l
ast month.  I have
: a healthy
 
backlog of correspondence and tried reaching you over the telephone to expedite
 
matters, but with no success.
 
In the event that you have not already applied under our April 1 deadline,
 
I a
ra sending t
he appropriate application forams to do so.  If you return them
 
to us within
: a week or ten days, you can still qualify f
or this grant cycle.
 
or, if you prefer, we have another deaelir
_e October 1 of this year.
 
I
n general, you should focus on three areas i
n the supplementary material t
o
 
accompany your application:  1
) expertise, both f
ilvoaking and cultural:
 
2
) film treatment,
- and 3
) distribution plans.  "e will need resumes of the
 
f
ila.makers and folklorint(s) involved in t
he project and a ten-minute sample
 
of the film  '
l
eer's wort
, should f
ollcm.  Also, i
t might be '
hest to address the
 
t
raditionality of ?
f
ir. Danforth's spoon playing.  The t
ilt
: treatment sho"Id s
kive
 
a
s general outline of the content and sequence of events in the proposed f
ilm.
 
T
ire distribution plan should g
ive as clear an indication as possible of hats
 
you plan to s
tet the film out and around.  Our advisory panel Is quite concerned
 
that Folk Arts--funded films receive as much public exposure as Possible,
 
In addition, please send a r
elease letter from Mr. Danforth, agreeing to
 
participate under the terns c
s
.
escribed i
n t
he application.  I did not notice
 
a f
ee for the artists listed in the budget.  Is nenforth t
o receive .
an honorarium?
 
I
f you p
lan to request $
48,300, t
his would be a relatively larne request in
 
terms of most of our applications and grants awarded previously.  `
you might
 
want t
o scale your request down if at all possible.  Also, the 57 contingency
 
i
s not allowable.
 
Now, to answer your questions concerning the ratchiniz portion
. of the budget.
 
'
latching funds used before the start of the grant period are not allowable.  If
 
the summer f
estival you want to f
ilri is near the end of a
sum�*r, there may be
 
enough t
ime to process an earlier start date, however.  As far as the release
 
of the funds, I must refer you t
o grants officer Rose "
.organ for full details.
 
I believe that you would be able t
o accept only a portion of a grant s
irply
 
by returning that unspent portion, but I am certain that this would be a most
 
undesirable situation for our advisory panel, s
ince in most cases, grant monies
 
returned t
o us cannot be spent by our progrzm, and are returned to the general
 
federal goveniment coffers for redistribution.
 
O e last note -- I strouply ur^e you to locate some cash to include in your
 
match, since our advisory *anal
. has stnted t
hat in the future
:, a significant
 
priority will be given t
o applicants with real cash matches.
 
I
f you have any further questions in f
illin  out the application, please f
eel
 
free to contact me by telephone.  If you call r
ye person--to--perasou collect at
 
202/634-4292 and leave Your name and number, I will return your call as soon

The Folk Arts proRran and panel received the attached document from our
 
sister agency at the pa
.:iel meeting last week.
 
Panelists discussed the possibility that staff right do well to recormer
_d
 
to applicants andeartakinr native American projects that they v
;et hold of
 
a copy of the N
III Code and consider tha implications of its content in
 
planning their projects.  This doesn't bottler me.  I think the purpose of
 
the Code is fine; I also think that our guidelines Y
)rotect us from rernetuatinR
 
the find of unthinking abuse the Corte is designed to prevent, so I don't
 
feel we need it all that much.  Still, it never hurts to remind people.
 
From a legal point of view, how does this sttike yore?

Subject:  National Heritage Fellowships
 
The Folk Arts panel has completed its deliberations on the first round of
 
National Heritage Fellowship nominations and recommends the attached  list
 
of fifteen nominees.
 
It is a strong list, reasonably
, well balanced in geography, discipline, and
 
ethnicity.
 It is more lop-sided in terms of age and sex; most nominees are
 
elderly and only three are women.
 Still, it is a list that I think both the
 
Endowment and the field can live with and be proud of.
 It should, incidentally,
 
produce a spate of nominations for the next round.
 
Here is what has to happen now, as I envision it:
 
MARCH
 Chairman signs off on slate of nominees.
 (Informal back-up
 
information available on request.)
 
Folk Arts researches and prepares biographical information for
 
inclusion in Council pages and for later public information use.
 
APRIL
 Folk Arts prepares application forms for the fifteen successful
 
nominees
 
MAY
 
Folk Arts prepares rejection letters for those not nominated.
 
(Unsuccessful nominations will be retained for one year in
 
case of repeats; after that, they will be destroyed.)
 
Folk Arts in conjunction with the Folklife Program at the
 
Smithsonian will draw up a plan for presentation of the
 
fellowships at a White House ceremony, possibly on July 4th.
 
Alternatively, the awards could be presented by the Chairman
 
at a ceremony on the Mall at the Folklife Festival July 4th
 
and 5th.  Appropriate Heritage Award winners could present
 
a short program at the White House July 4 picnic in either event.
 
National Council approves nominations and rejections.
 
r
 
Folk Arts mails application forms to the nominators who will
 
get the awardees signatures and return the forms for normal
 
grant processing.
 
- 2 -
 
MAY (
cont.)
 Folk Arts mails rejection letters, also returning backup
 
material where requested.
 
Chairman notifies state governors, state arts agencies, and
 
appropriate senators and congressmen-of successful nominations..;
 
JUNE
 White House and Smithsonian planning must be complete.
 
Office of Public Information prepares and distributes news
 
releases for national circulation as well as local hometown
 
newspapers and radios
 
Certificates are prepared; nominees
 I names must be lettered in
 
nicely, and each must be signed by Chairman Hodsoll, the
 
Folk Arts panel chairman, and the Folk Arts program director.
 
JULY
 Award ceremony.
 
Could you please let me know what you think of all this as soon as possible?,
 
This is a very tight time-frame, and we must get underway quickly and proceed
 
in an orderly fashion since the regular work of the Program has to be carried
 
on at the same time.
 (We have a big April 1 deadline coming up and a June panel
 
meeting as well as an August policy meeting and an August seminar.)

Dear Rick,
 
here is some infornation on the
. Polk Arta Coordinator positions as per our
 
conversation at the National Public Radio meeting !
were in Washinoton.  You'll
 
find a number of informal descriptions of the positions prenaareO by some of
 
the Coordinators, as well as sore more forval ones that have been used in
 
advertising the positions.  There is also a list of places where you might
 
find it useful to advertise (
should you decide to establish a positionj: this
 
list is also useful for locating general information on folk arts.  Finally
 
there is a reasonably complete listing of currently employed Polk Arts
 
Coordinators.  Two positions -- Haw ti and Guam -- are still unfilled; some
 
others have beet► filled so recently we haven't added them into our list,
 
specifically Iowa, Steven Oh
m State Capitol RuildIng, Iowa State Arts Council,
 
'
yes Moines, Town  50319 and Arkansas, Steven Poyser, Office of Arkansas States
 
Arts & W manitieas, Continental Building
., Suite 0500, Main and Markham Street,
 
Little Rock, Arkansas  72201.  K
aanaaa has just established a position (
funned
 
at the February Council veetinr) located at the State '
historical Society and
 
s
will begin recruiting soon, so a pleasing number of your neighboring states
 
will shortly have programs underway.
 
I hope you find all this information helpful.  Please give me a buzz if you
 
need any more, or if you'd like to talk over your specific situation again.
 
I have such high ropes for a Missouri folk arts program -
-- maybe what we
 
ought to do is to set it up that wav and j
ust not call it a "folk arts
 
coordinator" position at alll  There is something about the simple phrase
 
that seems to set Norm's teeth on adFe.
 
It was really nice to a

I hsd a long talk with Ormond today.  a

The version I had read before left ne vaguely troubled, and e

 I was not really reassured by today's conversation,

Congratulations, t
houph, on getting well started on two f
ilms.  That's nulte
 
a bit for a year.  Concerning future funding, the E
tndow^tent has rather more
 
money than we had anticipated having, the Congress restored quite a lot of
 
our money over and a
tove the President's log- point.  '
Next year (
fiscal 1933)
 
i
s more problematic; we don't really have a clue as to how we will fare.
 
In the meantime, though, the Pre►sident'as cuts got much more publicity t
han
 
the Congress' restoration, so most of the Endowment programs have
 -
sore money
 
t
han they had anticipated, since a lot of people apparently decided applying
 
t
o us wasn't worth the trouble.  So you could, if you like, apply for a grant
 
either from folk Arts or from Media.
 
I don't kncv the current Media deadlines, but you could get their
. with a phone
 
call.  Polk Arts' next deadline i
s April 15.  An usual, should you apply to
 
s
>edia, remember they are primarily concerned with file as an art form, so
 
write up your project that way.  In applying to us, renerber we care about

k 
- eliminated the Apprenticeship category and World Music
 
- held the Presentation category at a level percentage
 
- reduced the Documentation category from 2
7% t
o 22%
 
- held the Services to the  Field
 category
 approximately
 
level in percentage terms
 
In calculating an increase t
o $
2,666,000 (
OMB mark 143), one strategy would be
 
t
o return the Program's budget to its 1
981 percentage levels.  That was a
 
good year, and I felt the Program was in g
ood balance.
 
A different strategy would be t
o mount two special initiatives:
 
- under Presentation, t
o increase the budgets for t
ouring
 
- under Documentation, to increase the budgets for Recordings
 
and for "Mixed documentation"
 
- continue with Apprenticeships and World Music
 
Touring is self-explanatory.
 The increases under the Documentation reflect the
 
fact that the Native American  cylinder  copying project being conducted by the
 
Folklife Center at the Library of Congress is almost complete, and I anticipate
 
that tribes will begin to come to us for assistance in obtaining copies,

 Should

Dear Rob,
 
You're probably the wrong person to send the enclosed to, but then perhaps
 
you or !Teddy world know the right one (
assuming anyone's interested at allt).
 
The American r
ol&lore Society has been struegling for years with the problem
 
of tenure committees, promotion co mitteee and deans who think the published
 
acederaic article is the on e basis for promotion or other good acaderle
 
things.  The thought was that if AFS could agree on a policy for evaluating
 
folklorists' professionally that would include filrts,records, ane other public
 
section activities, we could l
xty this on the various university bodies and
 
possibly get them to loosen a
sp a trifle.  So here is the statement finally
 
agreed upon.  Do you think SF2! would be interested in republishing it or
 
revising it for their own concerns?  Maybe the newsletter editor?
 
It looks as though, by the way, I will be up in the northwest during June --
s"cifical
.ly sometime after June 20.  Is there ,
anything you or Freddy could
 
think of that I could usefully do in Washin4ton?  There's no rush to answer;
 
Just think it over, maybe.
 
Thank you again for your marvellous Performance and your sturdy support during
 
the past Council meeting.  You were just F
,reat.  See you lkrch 17thi

Rationale for
 
1982/1983 budget changes by category
 
The only change in our 1983 zao allocations by category -- other than
 
a reduction in the amount of program funds for the folk arts category
 
is that we de4icfed to drop the apprenticeship o4mMoDaMw category as
 
a further savings measure in order to meet the $2,286  figure we
 
were
` =>
 
After long and thoughtful deliberation,
 
,
f
it was decided that perhaps one of the least harmful approaches would
 
be to eliminate the apprenticeship category and hope to work with
 
the states to see  if there might be some way in which they could
 
pick up this important program.
 I would like to stress t* W
 
however,  that I continue to believe fervently in tho individual
 
grants and especially in the concept of apprenticeships.

Dear Ms. Hawe:
 
January 5
, 1982
 
Enclosed is a copy of a letter I have sent to Dan Sheehy who was closely involved
 
in the ethnic music festival grant obtained from your division last year by Robert
 
Kauffman.  I would like to bring the whole sordid matter to your attention as well
 
and ask your advice on how to handle it.
 
I know that the NEA cannot force Kauffman to pay me the money due me, but could you
 
tell me what the official view of his actions would be?  Are there precedents for
 
this kind of thing?  Does this mean that a private subcontractor in a grant serving
 
as a consultant, a sound technician, or performer can be deprived of pay at the
 
project director's whim?
 
Hoping you can shed some light on this problem, I remain —
 
Yours sincerely,

Washington DC,.20506
 
Dear Mr. Hodsoll:
 
January 5
, 1982
 
Last year I worked as a consultant for an Ethnic Music Festivnl project here in
 
Pittsburgh under, t
he d
irection of Robert Kauffman of the University of Pittsburgh
 
Music Dept. and sponsored by a grant from the NFA Falk -Arts n
ivision.  Dan Shcchy
 
was the Folk Arts specialist d
irectly involved.  Kauffman grossly mismanaged the g
i-ant,
 
committed several critical budgetary mistakes and logistic blunders, and lo.3t
 
substantial money on the event that occurred March 1
5, 1981.  My pay was d
ivided into
 
four months, and Kauffman appropriated my f
inal payment of $
294.00 over a month past
 
when the event had taken place, claiming he needed it to cover his deficit.  In other
 
words, he stole my justly deserved income to pad his own pocket.
 
The amount concerned may be small, but I am not wealthy, and the principle of
 
academic integrity is at stake.  I was not an investor but a private subcontractor
 
whose f
ee was not subject to further negotiation after its initial definition.
 
Kauffman claims that s
ince my checks came through the University account (as do a
ll
 
checks connected with any University project), I am a University employee and can be
 
terminated at whim. (
I
le, however, neglected to follow proper procedure for
 
t
ermination —no two weeks' notice, no written notice, etc.)  The case is currently
 
in the hands of attorneys, and I suspect the University will pay me off s
ince
 
Kauffman is costing them a bundle in his other logal disputes.
 
I would l
ike to know what NEA policy is regarding this matter.  Does the consultant,
 
the performer, or the private subcontractor have any rights after being contracted by
 
the project director for a specific fee?  Are there precedents-of which you are aware?
 
What is your opinion of the affair?
 
Please write and l
et me know what you think.
 
Best wishes,
 
Dr. Lawren

You may remember me calling you last May to complain about Robert Kauffman 's attempt
 
t
o defraud me of the payment due me for services to his project sponsored by the NEA.
 
What happened was Kauffman s
everely underbudgeted h
imself ,
 ignored my advice on
 
trimming h
is expenditures, got caught in a whirl of unforeseen costs that couldn't
 
be put off, and came up short after the event essentially'misfired.  He decided to
 
save h
is own pocketbook by d
ipping h
is hand into mine and appropriated my last
 
payment of $
294.00 t
o make up for h
is incompetency.
 
My position is that I was not an investor, and -my fee was not subject t
o negotiation.
 
I
 was a "fixed cost" just l
ike the hall r
ental, the janitor, or the sound system
 
r
ental.  Kauffman shifted the burden onto the University by declaring t
hat s
ince my
 
paychecks came from the University office (
all grants by University faculty have to
 
funnelled through the University books), 1 was a University employee and could thus
 
be terminated at will.
 
Kauffman, however, neglected to comply with University policy by r
iving me written
 
notice of t
ermination or any formal documentation of d
ismissal.  And, if my work was

-ae toll who agreed to work for a definite,
 
f
ixed amount not subject to the whims and vagaries of a bumbling project director:
 
The case is in the hands of attorneys, though the University lawyers have indicated
 
to my lawyer that Kauffman has been causing them lots of overtime the last few months
 
with his other legal entanglements.  He is also suing the University to have the
 
dismissal of his contract reversed, which seems unlikely.  So it's quite possibl e
 
the University will simply pay me off.
 
Admittedly, the money is small (
though my income la t
 year was far in excess of under
 
$4,500), but the principle .
of academic integrity Is what matters.  I bring this matter
 
to your attention so that you can be aware of how Robert Kauffman is likely to act
 
should he ever receive another grant.  I
'm truly sorry his peers judged him unworthy
 
of continuing to teach at the University starting this coming fall,'but I see no reason
 
why he has the r
ight to deprive me of my justly deserved income.
 
I would l

MEMORANDUM
 
January 19, 1982
 
To:  Uhairman Hodsoll
 
From:  Bess Lomax Hawes, Folk Arts Program
 
Subject:  Thoughts on Endowment Travel
 
1
.  There are three general kinds of site visits:
 
Type A - getting into the field to consult, advise, explain.  Such ideas
 
are best made by staff, next best by current panelists. Outside consultants, 
unless they are ex-panelists, are not always familiar enough with program
 
policies to represent them under varied conditions.
 
Type B - attendance to evaluate previously funded events (
festivals,
 
exhibit openings, concerts) or general projects.  Type B trips are best made
 
by panelists; they know just what to look for, having thought a lot about the
 
project, and they learn a lot.  Consultants are next best, especially where they
 
have a particular expertise (
Ojibwa basketry: Peking opera).  Though staff likes
 
and
. often makes such trips -- they are morale building and educational -- grantee
 
tension may mount up and staff view is sometimes very program-specific.
 
Type C - highly specific problem solving
, visits where an expert is
 
sent in to make recommendations on anything from accounting methods to cultural
 
renewal tactics to suitable sound equipment.  Type C visits must be made by
 
the appropriate expert who may be staff or panelist but i
s most usually a
 
consultant. 
2
.  Endowment ground rules have established that all staff trips and penal
.
 
attendance at panel meetings must be paid out of the program's admin budget.
 
Consultant travel or panel travel on Type A
,B. or C visits must come out of
 
program money either through a direct contract or through the kind of service
 
organization pass-through account Folk Arts and Expansion Arts maintain with an
 
outside service organization.
 
3
.  Folk Arts does not have enough staff to be able t
o cover its home base
 
operations and still make all the staff site visits we should- we also do not
 
have enough admin dollars.  Site visits by panelists and consultants are
 
essential.
 
4
.  It is nearly always possible and desirable to cover a number of sites
 
on each trip; economical trip planning therefore ordinarily results in each
 
trip being a combination of Types A and B
, and sometimes C
.
 
i
 - 2 -
 
5
.  All in all, every travel plan, if properly constructed, is a trade-
off -- selecting the best type of person with the particular expertise who is
 
available at the necessary time to do the job at the least cost from the
 
appropriate budget for the most fruitful results.  Is a puzzlement.
 
I would like to recommend in the most earnest terms that the Chairman
 
give out travel budgets to the programs with a firm clear statement that
 
that is it, and then stick to it.  Requirements that trips be approved by
 
administrative staff are irritating and futile.  The rule should be that if
 
we spend the money too fast, we will have t
o live with a shortage.  On the
 
other hand, if we save it up for the summer, i
t would be nice to feel that it
 
will not be taken away arbitrarily to provide some less provident program with
 
emergency moneys.  The Endowment has a long history of regarding the grass-
hoppers (
being an ant type myself, I find this excessively irritating, though
 
probably the grasshopper was a better musician.)
 
There was once a halcyon period when Keith Stevens had just come on as
 
budget director when the programs were given their admin budgets and told
 
that if they could save from one category (
say, printing), they could keep
  
their savings and put them into another (
sav staff
_ travel or training).  Every
 
significant technique Folk Arts figured out for saving money occurred to us
 
during that period.  It was super f
or morale and for tear
:-building.

Subject:
 Suggestion for a White House Concert
 
A young film-maker, George T
. Nierenberg, has just finished his second highly
 
successful film on Black art forms;  (
his first was "No Maps on My Taps").
 
This second effort is titled "Say Amen, Somebody".
 It features Thomas A. Dorsey
 
and Willie Mae Ford Smith, both of them considered giants in the field of gospel
 
music, as well as a number of younger gospel performers and ensembles.  The
 
film has premiered at the New York Film Festival and at a festival in Colorado;
 
in both places it earned standing ovations.  United Artists Classics, a distri-
buting company, will release it for theatrical showing across the country in
 
February.  This is really unusual for a film of this type and means they think
 
it might actually make some money.
 
February is also Black History Month.
 It seems an interesting possibility to
 
suggest to the White House either a premier showing of the film, or a live
 
concert honoring Dorsey and Smith to include some of the younger artists
 
shown in the film, or both, during the month.  At Cathy Christie's suggestion,
 
Nierenberg has already sent an informational packet on the film to Muffy Brandon.
 
In case she calls you, I thought you'd like to know that Folk Arts and Media
 
funded the film along with NEH.  We think it's excellent and well worth White
 
House attention.
 
Nierenberg is also working on several special showings:
 a possible benefit for
 
Henry Street Settlement in New York and a premier at one of the large Black
 
churches in Washington.  His film company is GTN Productions, 230 Park Avenue,
