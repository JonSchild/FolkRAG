WILLIAM HENNESSEY 
 
SUMMARY: William Hennessey talks to Pat Jasper about his career starting from New 
York port to now working at Exxon in Bayport. He also discusses the main 
responsibilities of a marine superintendent and how automation has changed the industry.   
 
Aug 07, 2012  -  Exxon 
 
00:00:30 
Born in Brooklyn in 1951. Father was tug captain. Grandfather was tug captain. Gave an 
entry into the business. Have many relatives in the industry. Had first job with Texaco on 
a tug boat. Left Texaco in 1984 to Maran Towing to become a pilot and tug captain. 
Lasted till 1988 when there was a big tug strike in NY. Then became a financial advisor 
with Prudential for two years. In 1990 got a call from Exxon to work at SFO Bay. Busy 
port for Exxon. In 2003 got a call for a shore assignment. Did harbor work and coast wise 
moving of petroleum barges. Had to move from Florida to Houston. Came to Houston in 
2003. Quality assurance on vessels. Went to Middle East, Africa, Asia. Got on vessels 
and made sure quality was met. Then became Marine Superintendent in Baytown in 
2010. Have 1800 barges that load or discharge from Baytown. Move a lot of petroleum 
products. Very close to Maritime community without sailing.  
 
00:05:55 
Marine superintendent - primary responsibility is any vessel that comes to Baytown need 
to make sure it is acceptable. Not from a quality standpoint but have to make sure the 
ship will fit on the berth. Houston is a 45ft deep channel. Maintain a 45ft depth on the 
berth. Some berths are slightly less. Make sure vessel size fits the assignment they have 
been given. Also dredge the channel because Houston ship channel has a lot of siltation. 
Have annual dredging operation. Means working with port of Houston and Army Corp 
Engineers, the contractor, dredgers. Lot of permitting. Once it starts, it lasts about three 
weeks to dredge all the docks in Baytown. Have a contract to go on board every ship and 
monitor the load and discharge and cargo operations.  
 
00:09:22 
Exxon does own and operate some vessels with an affiliate organization. But most of the 
vessels in Baytown are third party and will be chartered by the customer to either bring 
product or to purchase product for their customers. So they are all chartered vessels, spot 
chartered or time chartered. Have crude ships, time chartered and most of them spot 
chartered. Export different chemicals on cargo sales.  
 
00:10:55 
Import a lot of crude, domestic production has increased. Also export product. Largest 
part is for domestic use. Just want to make sure barges are loaded and unloaded and 
discharged efficiently and safely. Every vessel has to be sampled for product quality. 
Tanker men meet the barge and are responsible for load and unload.  
 
 
 
00:13:20 
Import and export is a growing business, Exports are increasing daily. Growth means 
more jobs, expanding facility. Strategic asset - limited number of refineries over the 
world. Baytown complex is made up of a number of companies. Complex largest in 
North America. Makes 200 million barrels. Huge asset. Competitive asset. Big expansion 
with chemical plant. Driven on domestic production of crude. Good news not just for 
Baytown but the whole ship channel.  
 
00:15:40 
Baytown has a long history over 90 years. See a lot of family relations in the industry. 
Many different talents and skill sets. Education is very important. People with many 
different backgrounds.  
 
00:17:41 
ONly marine person at the site, gives an unique view. Start in the industry, came up 
through the ranks, through opportunity and hard work and luck. Very rewarding business. 
Liaison for the refinery. 
 
 
00:20:30 
Most facilities do not have a marine person. May have access to marine people. Provides 
unique opportunity. Regardless of level of education, experience plays a big role. Not the 
standard model to have people with marine experience at the facility. Given the size of 
Baytown and the traffic, very few facilities handle amount of traffic that  
 
00:22:47 
Baytown is the largest refinery in America. Run 580,000 crude barrels a day. 60% of that 
s water borne, rest comes from various pipelines. Barges move product back and forth. 
Very difficult business, capital  intensive, lot of labor. Running at full capacity almost 
every day of the year.  
 
00:25:27 
Use harbor lights and Port Vision. Both track ships through the AIS system. Harbor lights 
takes it a step further and gives pilots schedule. Schedulers or dock supervisors use that 
tool and find out if the ship has tender. Cuts down a lot on the need to call somebody.  
 
00:28:39 
Don't deal with the ships or the tugs directly. Deal with dock coordinators and 
supervisors everyday at 8 am. Look at the the skeds, delays. Sked needs to be constantly 
changed. Contractors like dredgers, surveyors. Will communicate depths and drafts to the 
industry. There is a lot of interface with a lot of people on the dock. Will speak to the 
person in charge. About 80 people working on the docks, shift workers, 4 days on, 4 days 
off. Fill all these dock positions. With each dock, have 13 berths, 5 docks. that need to be 
 
 
manned at all times. Specially anytime a vessel is there. Part of job is to get to know 
people. Make sure people are comfortable and know there is someone to help. All foreign 
ships need coastguard inspection. If ship has not been to the US in over a year, they may 
be to of compliance and need to be inspected.  
 
00:34:50 
Exxon prides themselves on a safety record. Number of times a year there is a hard 
landing and docks have to be repaired. Being at each dock, handling specific products can 
be a big challenge. Lot of people in the logistical chain. Zero tolerance for accidents. 
Need an engineer to manage the operations.  
 
00:38:04 
Hard landings - dock fenders are designed for a certain wave and certain speed impacting 
the docks, like .2ft per second. If there is a certain miscommunication, the ship will land 
hard on the dock, damaging the dock. repairs will then take 8 days and have to limit the 
usage of the docks. Recently had a hard landing on the crude dock. That was pretty 
critical because there are only two crude docks. Don't have spare docks, nowhere else to 
move that type of volume. Need to have the right plan and the right people. Chemical 
engineers live with the constant challenge of disruption on the docks and manage a very 
stressful situation.  
 
00:41:22 
have two main groups. Shift teams and the docks day team. Five people part of the day 
team. Start work at 7.30 and go home by 5.30. After hours go with the job. Can get a call 
at anytime and have to manage ship clearances even on weekends or holidays. Rather be 
on top of the job than not know what is going on. The marriage - when a ship is delayed 
beyond the charter agreement, have to pay for the excess time. Have analysts in Budapest 
and discuss things with them on daily basis. Part of the workload. Not unusual to be 
involved on vacations, holidays or weekends.  
 
When a ship is scheduled to arrive, there is a 3-day window. if the vessel arrives in a 3 
day window and they are ready to do what they were hired for, have to accept tender. So 
need to put them on a clock. Typically a ship will have tender to come, load, and be ready 
to sail. If it goes beyond that, have to pay an hourly rate for the ship. Ships 5-6 years ago 
were more expensive like 100,00 a day. Now more like 25,000 a day. Costs have come 
down a bit. Look at it closely and try to reduce it. Not as much about cost as it is about 
berth utilization. Vessel operators would rather use the ship than have it sitting on the 
clock. Merge analysis is another industry in itself.  
 
Based in Budapest because part of global presence. Have some business offices in 
Argentina. Time is easier for Argentina than Budapest.  
 
00:48:32 
 
 
Have worked in three very different ports. Earlier people used to say being at the port 
was a dying industry. People were very short sighted. Ports around the world are now 
maxed out. Have always worked for oil companies. All had large fleet- BP, EXXON etc. 
A lot of the piers were being converted to different used - condos, tennis courts etc. 
Marine industry was trying to keeping it for marine uses. No inland traffic in SFO or NY 
unlike Houston. Big inland traffic in Houston. All deep water ocean going barges. There 
are a lot of similarities with all these ports.  
 
00:54:15 
Biggest change is how big everything can get. Harbor tugs are now three times the horse 
power.. From 1600 horsepower to 6000 horsepower. Ships have become much bigger. 
Job is not as much to work on these vessels. Since 9/11 security has become more strict, 
makes it more difficult on sailors. Sometimes sailors are not allowed off the vessel. 
Baytown is one of the few facilities in the country that has a plan approved by the 
coastguard where non TWIC carrying sailors can transit the facilities. So manage to move 
a lot of people ashore so that they can get a change of scenery and do some shopping etc. 
In the 70s could drive or walk in and out of any facility. Job has changed a lot, mostly for 
the better but have taken the fun out of it.  
 
00:58:21 
Turn around time for vessels and ships is now faster. Earlier they used to be around for 7 
days. Vessels have some advancement in the mooring system. But once a vessel is 
secured to a dock, will connect to multiple hoses. Some ships unload many different 
products. Sampling and gauging is pretty much the same. Not a whole lot of change. 
Except for the volume there has not been much of a change in manning or the process.  
 
01:01:18 
Some of the components, like the ship itself used to sail with more than 30 members in 
the crew. Now most ships sail with just 20 crew members. Tugs would have crew of 5-6. 
Now tugs operate with 2 people. As far as shore side, not so much change. Still need 
same number of people on docks.  
 
01:02:15 
One of the biggest changes was getting rid of cooks. If there is a boat running 24 hours a 
day. There will be captain, mate and a deckhand. Combined some jobs. reduces the 
number of people. Engine rooms re all automated. Everything monitored by computers, 
alarms if something goes wrong. Line handling has not changed. Ropes are now larger. 
Most of them are now on a wench, hydraulic or electric. Automation of engine rooms and 
line handling wenches that have helped reduce labor.  
 
01:05:38 
Shipping companies that do a short run, is important to get their crew off the boat at short 
intervals. They went to coastguard and then to Exxon. Wanted a plan that would meet 
security requirements and wanted the coastguard to work on this. Identified that it was an 
 
 
issue that there were unhappy sailors on the ships. Plan - each vessel has a ship security 
officer would escort crew members to a security van and that would take them to the 
gate. Security van charges a nominal fee for the service. Don't allow taxis, people are not 
allowed to walk . But this security van is allowed and it has a few bus stops along the 
way. There is a document that needs to be signed and tracked. Main thing is vessel has 
communication. Been doing this for two years. Sailors are very happy. Almost all ships 
that come to the dock use this van to get on and off the vessel. Wonderful for sailors to 
have that connection. Worked well for everybody. Not an undue strain on facilities.  
 
01:12:27 
Track every one that is coming or going. Everyone is documented. TWIC escort. Very 
expensive.  
 
01:14:54 
The 8 am meeting is when the day team - section supervisor and the dock supervisors, 
measurement and maintenance supervisors will meet and go over dock forecasts. The 
forecasts will not only tell vessels that are at the facility or coming to the facility and 
ongoing work at the dock, maintenance, conflicts, schedules. Have to manage mostly day 
work, Manage the berths. Logistics. Will also discuss the activities with the supervisors. 
Good way to start the day. Meeting at 9 am with product quality group. Challenge 
sometimes to get out of office and out on the docks. Meeting people and looking at 
operations first hand is always an eye opener. Always have to keep an eye on what is 
going on.  
 
01:19:40 
Helps that the management is all at the Marine terminal.  
 
Back in the SO days, had a very large flee, owned marine terminals and more vessels. 
and so there was a lot of marine expertise. There are about 80 marine advisors in the 
company worldwide. Shrinking as far as people with actual ship board experience. there 
are still people coming through universities. Knowledge and experience is invaluable. 
 
01:26:10 
Relations within the industry, can’t underestimate what a great port community Houston 
has. port of Houston is unique. Have close relationships with port of Houston authority, 
coastguard. Allow coastguard inspections on the docks. There are a number of things that 
have been implemented that are helpful to the vessels. A ship needs a lot of support. 
"They are a floating island." Try to offer any help they need. Not a facility that says no.  
 
Have sailed for so many years so know what it is to get and keep stores. It is not just 
about giving. Receive benefits too when a vessel gets its needs met. Everything is very 
tightly scheduled.
