Dear 3ess:
 
All in all, the Festival was more than I expected it to be, not
 
having attended one there before.
 However,  I would like to make
 
a few suggestions that might help to smooth out some of the
 
relatively few rough areas that I encountered.
 
On Workshop I
, as well as on the Main Regional Stage, the sound
 
systems were quite good, but we could have used a workable
 
sound system at the Workshop Stage II.
 Also,  I suggest that
 
we provide boom mike stands on all stages because of their versa-
tility and flexibility.
 Performers who must sit down often
 
have a difficult time dealing with stationary microphones.
 Due
 
to the size of the base of the mike stand,  it causes
 problems
 
getting an equal balance between the instrument and the voice.
 
I believe that boom stands would resolve the problem.
 
Workshop Stage II is located in an area very pleasing to the eye,
 
but the ear suffers because of the heavy automobile traffic such
 
a short distance behind the stage, not to mention the noise from
 
planes.
 I would argue for retention of the present Workshop II
 
area contingent on providing a good sound system there.
 
I understand that the volunteer situation during the first week
 
was excellent.
 However, during the week that I was there,  I
 
rarely saw a volunteer at the Workshop II area, which causeJ me
 
a couple of slight problems when I had to leave the area during
 
a performance to fetch someth ing for a performer.
 I realize
 
that since the volunteers are donating their time that we can't
 
expect to work them into the ground, but I would hope that we
 
could find some way to insure having a sufficient number always
 
on hand to cover whatever needs may arise during performances.
 
In terms of style of presentation I found, as did everyone else,
 
that it certainly varies with each performer.
 I don't think
 
that we can make any hard and fast rules concerning presentation
 
style.
 I do believe that the presenter should stay with the
 
performer in most cases throughout the presentation.
 my feeling
 
is that there were a number of participants that I worked with
 
2.
 
who were capable of pulling off their own "shows," but in terms
 
of holding to the educational purpose of the festival, I felt
 
justified in interrupting the performance and interjecting a few
 
pointed questions concerning the performer's background, both
 
musically and personally.
 
I hope that these comments and suggestions will be useful in
 
helping make the 1
976 Festival even better than 1975.
 In
 
closing,  I
'd like to say that I felt very pleased to have been
 
a part of what,  to me, was a most successful festival.
 
Since ely,

 FESTIVAL OF AMERICAN FOLK LIFE
 
Dear Mr.  Powers:
 
This office has been retained by a group of individuals who
 
participated as employees in the Festival of American Folk
 
Life this past summer.
 
After a great deal of frustration,  numerous long distance
 
telephone calls and extensive correspondence,  they still
 
have not been paid for their services.
 The following named
 
individuals state they are due the sums set forth to the
 
right of their names:
 
1
.
 Barbara LaPan Rahm
 
2
.
 Nicholas Hawes

376.15
 
329.64
 
274.00
 
389.44
 
100.00
 
The following individuals apparently had their contracts rene-
gotiated,  and although they are due significant sums,  the
 
amounts are not known at this time:
 
1
.
 Joyce Bynum
 
2.
 Margaret Bach
 
3
.
 Bess Lomax Hawes
 
4.
 Marilyn Salvador
 
5.
 Justin Bishop

.
 Mike Heisley
 
I am further advised that the amounts as set forth above do
 
not accurately reflect the value of their services in that
 
they extended their services into areas far beyond their
 
contractual agreement,  and did so,  in the spirit of the
 
festival.

It
. is extremely unfortunate that this matter has gone as far
 
as it has.
 The group informs me that they have spoken to.no
 
less than 10 individuals in positions of high authority
 
regarding payment,  all of which was to no avail.
 
Regardless of ill feelings engendered as a result of the
 
inefficiency of the Institution,  the responsible and approp-
riate path to take would appear to be to have someone
 
immediately assigned to the accounts of the above--named
 
individuals and see that they are paid forthwith.
 
It would be appreciated if you could advise me as to what
 
individual has been assigned the task of paying my clients
 
and when payment will be made.
 With the new school year
 
commencing the amounts due would greatly assist this group
 
in sustaining themselves this coming year.
 
Your anticipated courtesy and cooperation is greatly appreciated.
 
Very truly yours,
 
KAUFMAN,  ROTHMAN and KAUFMAN

Dear David:
 
I
'm enclosing all t
ine material I have in writing on the Molokans
 
and the Dunns, including t
iie newsletter the Los Angeles P
lolokah
 
congregation published after their appearance at the 1975
 
Festival.
 
In going throurii thin
, scattered clump -- which shows the ill-
effects of
 1
_he :
watts line available - lots didn't get
 
written down but said over the phone - you should bear in mind
 
a few things:
 
the Dunns work with every kind of R
iissian-speaker
 
Old Believers, Molokans, Dukhobors, the works
 
the Molokan communities in California are divided
 
into two slightly opposing congregations -- Los Angeles and
 
San Francisco.
 There's a kind of doctrinal disagreement involved.
 
the southern (l.A.)Plolokans  are the ones who came
 
to the 1975 Festival; this was the second time in the history of
 
their church they had ever sung for outsiders.
 I have not heard
 
the San Francisco group's music; I have a hunch that the L.A.  folks
 
have perhaps the greater tradition, because the main Molokan
 
composer (
aged 89 and with a voice like a young boy)  lives in Los
 
Angeles and is still active in singing
_.
 His name is ;
loses Voikoff
 
and he is a marvel.
 
the northern Molokans did not come to the Festival and
 
I suspect need some t
.l.c, which the Dunns have been providing.
 This
 
may be why they are interested in t
:le project Ethel writes about in
 
her letter of October 13. Tom Ver
inum and I made various attempts to
 
i
ielp (
see Prof. Mickiewicz letter) but didn't come up with anything
 
practical.
 It is this project that I think might,  then,  still be
 
open and even fundaLle if the right proposals were made.
 
If and when you see the Dunns, ticase give them my very best -
;
ais.ies
 
and tell them that a delegation of Russian Old Believers came to the
 
Festival this summer from Oregon.
 They were brought- in as crafts
 
demonstrators, but we started getting taem to sing and uy the end
 
of t
iie Festival trey sounded absolutely superb -- a totally different
 
repertoire from t
i:e Molokans, all of it secular and some of
. it, I
 
believe, fairly old.
 
If anything works out here and you need tapes of either the L.A. Molokans
 
or the Old Believers, let me know and I
'll try to net them for you (or
 
the Dunns as the case might be).
 Good luck and best wishes -- it's a
 
great musical tradition and I think y6u'd have fun with it.
 Again,
 
thanks for doing such a great job at the Festival and before.

Society and Festa "Our Lady of Miracles" in California
 
Its' Beginning
 
Our Lady of Miracles wished to be honored and veneratrA with
 
love as a mother by her Portuguese children in California.  In 1933,
 
a handful of Portuguese organized the "Portuguese American Club" in
 
the city of G
ustine, their purpose was to enable the Portuguese im-
migrant t
o receive his American Citizenship.
 
Later they wished to have a saint for patroness for the club.
 
At the same period Mr. M. B
. Souza, better known as Manuel Sao Miguel,
 
had arrived from a visit to his native island Sao Miguel in the Azores
 
Islands.  Members of the club produced various names of saints that
 
they wished would be used for patroness of the club.  Mr. M. B
. Souza
 
mentioned a name that he remembered of a beautiful festival he had
 
seen in Terceira, Village of Serreta, in honor of the mother of G
od
 
under the t
itle of "Our Lady of Viracles, where songs were sung, bull
 
fights, bodo de leite and parades.  This was the name t
hat should be
 
used in order to reunite the Portuguese of California in the same way
 
it united the people of Terceira who left their homes to participate
 
in the beautiful festival in honor of Our Lady of Miracles.
 The name
 
of Our Lady of Miracles was unanimously approved by all the members
 
as the patroness for the Testa in G
ustine.  Mr. Souza offered to pay
 
for all the expenses involved for the statue and insignias, which he
 
did.  For the first t
ime the name of Our Lady of Miracles was used as
 
patroness for the beautiful festival which is still celebrated every
 
year in Gustine.
 
Then they needed a man who would be able t
o take t
he first steps
 
with the church and the pastor.  Mr. John T
. Mattos was nominated as
 
he w
.
,
:
,s very prominent in the Festas t
o the Holy Ghost and was expe-
rienced in religious feste
rs.  At the t
ime, Mr. Mattos was not present
 
and a committee composed of three men, Mr. Manuel Mendonca, Mr. Manuel
 
E.  G
omes and Mr. Antonio Mendonca, were chosen to invite Mr. Mattos to
 
come to the meeting which was in session.  They arrived at his home at
 
eleven o
'clock, in the evening
_, to invite him, an invit-,tion that he
 
accepted.
 
Upon his arrival at the meeting they i
nformed him of what h
nd been
 
discussed, he was then nominated to take the first steps in regard to
 
the Pastor and the church.  r"
.
r. Mattos informed t
he members of the club
 
that it would be difficult to explain to the Pastor how a religious
 
festa with Our
- Lady of Miracles as Patroness could be formed with a club,
 
The Pastor w
•s informed of what had been discussed, but could not
 
understand how a religious festival could be organized with a club.
 At
 
that t
ime, the p
.ris:1 was in debt and needed help.  Mr. Mattos explained
 
to the Pastor in this way, we are all Portuguese, and the Portuguese has
 
in his blood religion, the believe in G
od and in h
is Blessed Mother and
 
-2-
all t
he saints.  All Portuguese are Catholic and believe in G
od, for
 
whatever reason t
hey do not always come to church but all will be
 
united 5
0-50 with the church and the club.  For example
', when we go
 
t
o collect donations some will say I
'm not interested in the club but
 
will donate anyway because I want to help the church, another will say
 
I like the club but don't care for the priest but all will g
ive their
 
donations, because it is a traditional Portuguese festival.  The Blessed
 
Mother wants all her children united.
 
Father O
'Brien who was the Pastor at the time answered, I will
 
inform the Bishop of the Diocese of all this, then I will tell you
 
what I am able to do.  The answer was yes, but under the following
 
conditions, Our Lady of Miracles must belong t
o the parish church and
 
there she must stay and the club must be organized 5
0-50 with the parish.
 
A meeting of the Portuguese-American Club was called and the members
 
were I
nformed by Mr. Mattos of what the pastor had said.  Mr. Mattos was
 
chosen to make all the necessary preparations for the first Festa to Our
 
Lady of Miracles.  Mr. Mattos named Mr. John T
. Braza to work with him;
 
they then went t
o San Francisco to order the Statue of Our Lady of
 
Miracles and all the insignias.
 
1936 was the first festa made with the new Statue of Our Lady of
 
Miracles in G
ustine.  Mr. Mattos was the first President.  In that same
 
year Mr. Jose de Sousa Brazil "0 Charua" came from Terceira especially
 
to sing for the festa l also actors depicting the life and miracles of
 
Saint Anthony under the direction of Father Julio Martin from San Jose.
 
Mr. Joe A. Oliverira, Mr. John M. Silva, Mr. Frank M. Soares and Mr. John
 
T. Mattos were nominated to r
ent a large tent and place it in the park
 
for the accomodation of the visitors who came in large numbers.  The tent
 
cost the festa $800.00 for three days.  This festa together with the club
 
5
0-50 made a profit of $600.00 ($300.00 for the p
arish and $300.00 for
 
the club).
 
In 1937, a new president was named by the club.  He was very rich,
 
had many words and ideas, but nn
nt much faith.  He believed more in-his
 
money than in the Blessed Mother.  He decided that the festa should be-
long only to the club and t
he Pastor should receive only a small payment
 
the same as he was paid by the Penetcost Society when a festa was made.
 
Under his direction the club broke its promise, one-third of the members
 
were for the club the others were with the pastor.  The Pastor would not
 
break his promise given to the club of 5
0-50 but would not give up the
 
Lady of Miracles, in church was where she belonged.  The club started
 
another festa with the name of "Feste
. da Serreta".  At the end of three
 
years the club ended, all its debts unpaid.  The club declared bankruptcy.
 
-3-
The Festa of Our Lady of Miracles continued like a garden abundant
 
with flowers, similar t
o the Blessed Mother full of love and devotion
 
which attracted all her Portuguese children in California.
 Our Lady of
 
Miracles wants respect, peace and devotion and in this way will unite
 
all here Portuguese children once a year for her Festa in the center
 
of California, as is the tradition brought to us from our fathers, and
 
grandfathers from the islands in the Azores and Portugal.  Our parades,
 
bull fights, s
ong fests, bodo de leite, novenas, hymns and flowers all
 
show respect and love for Our Lady of Miracles.
 
The first "Bodo de Leite" t
hat was made in G
ustine was very
 
interesting.  When the committee went t
o get the license so that the
 
procession with the cows would be able to g
o through the main street,
 
the mayor said no, the cows could not be taken through the main street
 
but could be taken through a side s
treet.  The mayor and police were
 
watching as it was something strange t
o them.  They were surprised as
 
t
o the cleanliness and to the beautifully decorated cows.  When they
 
saw this they changed the plans and sent the cows through the main
 
street and accompanied the procession t
o the park where sweet bread
 
and milk was served to all that were present.  Mr. and Mrs. Frank Rocha
 
Martin decorated the cows and made the flowers for t
he f
irst Bodo de
 
Leite.  Mrs. Martin decorated the statues for many years.  Mr. Mattos
 
invited the boys and g
irls (12 to 17 years of age) t
o accompany the cows
 
in the procession each couple dressed in white.
 
The Society of Our Lady of Miracles was formed which now is spread
 
through all of California with a g
reet number of members.  The committee
 
that went to the residence of the Bishop of the Diocese to make the
 
rules for t
he Festa and Society of Our Lady of Miracles were Mrs. Maria
 
Beffa, Mr.  Jose DeOliveira Sr., Mr. M. M. G
omes, Mr. Joe V
. Aguiar,
 
Mr. John T. Braza and Mr. John T
. Mattos.  They were received with
 
courtesy by the Bishop who accepted their request and made the bylaws.
 
The bylaws are very well made for those who are honest and keep the
 
commandments of our Catholic faith.  These rules have been forgotten,
 
they are alive but have been closed in a drawer and for a Society t
o
 
be in correct working order it must follow rules.
 
Today t
he parish has under the name of Our Lady of Miracles a
 
beautiful Catholic School, three buses to transport more than three
 
hundred children who are being educated by s
isters.  All of this is
 
paid for and functioning well, all in the name of Our Lady of Miracles.
 
We hope that the new g
eneration will know how to keep up our
 
traditions.  The old ones have ended, if there is still any that are
 
living they have not the spirit or the courage to continue but still
 
have faith in Our Lady of Miracles.

Los Angeles, California  90045
 
Dear Juan:
 
It was very pleasant to hear from you again as well as to learn that
 
you have an exciting new job.
 
I think you have a splendid idea for your forthcoming cultural week,
 
and I shall be delighted to help in any way that I can.
 However,  I
 
shall be staying on at the Smithsonian at least the rest of the fall,
 
and I think the best help I can be is to refer you to some of the
 
Los Angeles people who have the information you'll need.
 
Barbara Rahm and I
, as you know, coordinated the California presentation
 
in 1975;  in the spring of 1976, Barbara came to Washington and did the
 
entire Regional America presentation this past summer.
 She is back home
 
now, and you can reach her at 2522 24th Street, Santa Monica, Cal., 90405
 
(
450-2072).
 She has names and addresses of the Los Angeles folks who
 
came in 1975 as well as others who came in 1976.
 She also can give you
 
good advice about where additional field work can and should be undertaken,
 
if you plan to do any, and about programming and the like.
 If I were you,
 
I
'd have a long session with her; she's full of good ideas.
 I took the
 
liberty of mentioning your project to her so she will not be surprised
 
if you call.
 
Then there are two other people you ought to get in touch with: Dan Sheehy,
 
who is the most energetic field worker in the whole area and who turned
 
up a whole bunch of new musicians this summer, and Alicia Gonsalez who,
 
after the 1975 Festival, applied for and got a small grant to do a multi-
cultural survey of Boyle Heights, the results of which will be displayed
 
in a relief map with associated interview tapes from Boyle Heights residents,
 
the whole to be placed in the local library.
 It's a fine project and
 
I think almost complete.
 Anyway, Dan can be reached evenings at 391-8647
 
and Alicia through the Goez Gallery  (
264-7265) or through either-Dan or
 
Barbara;  I don't seem to have mer most recent phone number here.
 
Just one final general observation.
 Lots of the people you remember from
 
1975 were not from Los Angeles but from other places in California -- the
 
Armenians and Portuguese, for example, were from San Francisco and San
 
Diego respectively.
 The major components from Los Angeles actually were
 
Chicano, Anglo  (
fiddlers, mostly) and Philippino.
 However, there are
 
tremendous possibilities for an extensive and exciting multi-cultural
 
presentation within L.A.;  the trick is to get a bit more field work done.
 
.
q  
(
For just one example, I know there is a large Samoan community in wouth-
west L.A.;  I
've just never gotten around to visiting with them.)
 You
 
might want to talk with Barbara and Dan about such additional field work
 
possibilities; perhaps you could even involve some of your students.
 It's
 
lots of fun, though you need to know some tricks of the trade, and you
 
need lots of cultural sensitivity and patience.
 Barbara and I worked
 
nearly six months with the Russian Molokans before they ever sang for
 
us at all, they were so shy and so sure that we would put their music down.
 
Anyway, good luck, and I hope you don't feel that I am passing you off by
 
referring you to Dan, Slicia and Barbara.
 It's just that they are
 
not only in Los Angeles now but also that they have been in touch with
 
the L.A.  folks far more recently than I
.
 Don't hesitate to call or
 
write again if I can be of any further help;  (call me person-to-person
 
collect at 202-381-4348 and I
'll call you back on the Watts line).
 
My very best wishes for the success of your presentation, and please give
 
my greetings to any of my old friends from Northridge or elsewhere that
 
you may happen to see.
 I
'll probably be coming back to teach at North-
ridge during the spring semester and will hope to see you then.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Bess:
 
It has been a l
ong time since I have had any communications
 
with you -
- since 1
975 when we performed at the Folklife Festival
 
to be sure.
 I have a great favor to ask of you; but before I
 
do, I must give you some history.
 I am presently employed in
 
the Chicano Studies Department at Loyola Marymount University.
 
One of my duties for the upcoming year is to work within a newly
 
developed "Student Development Center" designed to give students
 
an equity in experiential learning to go along with their "book
 
learning."  The program i
s multipractic in scope, and it allows
 
the s
taff much freedom of movement.
 
Within this program, I have been asked to develop a cultural
 
week.
 On thinking about what has traditionally been presented as
 
cultural weeks, I came to the realization that these affairs have
 
always been of a monocultural nature.  Although I am not excusing
 
myself, I have many a time been responsible for this happening.
 
In attempting to remedy this situation, I readily thought of the
 
wonderful cross-cultural experience we had in Washington.
 So, I
 
am now turning to you for help and advice.
 
Would you please direct me to those various groups in the Los
 
Angeles area with whom you have contact so that I may enlist their
 
help in presenting this cultural week.
 I am s
peaking of the
 
Russian singers, Armenian dancers, for example, and so on.
 
I feel this is an unfair request, for I recognize the extreme
 
amount of hard work you have devoted to accumulating contacts.

Dear Marjorie:
 
Thank you for the program of the Kaleidoscope Folk Festival; I found
 
i
t very interesting and am
, sure it was a great success.
 
I
'm afraid my recent l
etter must have been unclear.  The Sourdough
 
Crock that I sent does not belong e
ither to me or to the Smithsonian;
 
it was a special issue gotten out on the occasion of the California
 
presentation at the Festival of American Folklife but it was, is, and
 
remains the property of the California Folklore Society.  That is the
 
reason i
t was offered for sale after the Festival -
- in order to
 
enrich the coffers of the CFS a bit.  L
ikely, the reason for the
 
confusion was that my letter was written on Smithsonian stationery;
 
this was s
imply because the festival l
irector offered to support CFS
 
by sending out the l
etter for us and mailing out any copies ordered.
 
In any event, this means that the swap you suggested won't work out s
inc , 
the Crock does not belong to me; the leftover copies will remain here
 
and any eventually unsold will be shipped back to Greg Longenecker.
 
I hope your teaching is going well and that the fall semester has s
tarted
 
off as you would hope.  I miss California and teaching and shall be
 
-lad to get home next September.
 
Yours,
 
Hess Lomax Hawes

Dear Bess,
 
We were happy to hear the festival in Washington
 
was such a success.
 
I agree with you that it is not often possible
 
to give students uptodate and well-researched
 
information about our own state.
 With this in
 
mind I would like to suggest an exchange of
 
programs.
 
I will enclose a copy of our festival program,
 
as we too have copies left over.
 
I
'll hope to hear from you soon.

Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
I was glad to get your l
etter of July 1
8 about the Molokan performance in
 
Washington.
 I took no action on your suggestion about writing Alan Jabbour,
 
because I wasn't sure that i
t would do any good.  Now, however, I have something
 
that r
eally needs your help and his:
 
About four years ago I learned that Molokans in S
an Francisco used a
 
songbook with musical notations during the 1
920s.
 I knew that the compiler was
 
a man named Zhogloff, who had received musical training at the music conservatory
 
in Samara.  At the turn of the century there was a f
ierce debate in Molokan
 
communities about whether t
o use musical notations.  Molokans l
iving in Harbin
 
(Manchuria) almost certainly used this s
ongbook well into the 1
930s--which i
s
 
as far as I have records for them.
 I have recently been reminded that a group
 
of these Molokans s
ettled in Australia.  One of my informants t
ells me that
 
he has seen this songbook in San Francisco; part of i
t i
s a xerox, but he claims
 
that the very lovely Easter hymn "Mariia stoiala u groba" i
s among those in
 
the book.  He claims that part of the music comes from Rimsky-Korsakoff and
 
Tchaikovsky.
 I feel that even i
f this music i
s that recent, i
t i
s a discovery
 
of some importance.  Rimsky-Korsakoff after all was a well known collector of
 
folk s
ongs.  I need your help.
 I know a great deal about Molokans and almost
 
nothing about music.  As i
t happens the music i
s the sum of Molokan culture in
 
this country.
 I think part of the style can be traced back to the Old Believers,
 
and some of the imagery too.
 
Earlier, we spoke of your inviting San Francisco Molokans t
o s
ing in 1
976.
 
I suggested that you send a formal invitation to the church committee (dukhovnyi
 
komitet) and that you approach Mrs. Alex Pushkarow (
Tonia).
 I
f you were to
 
extend an invitation t
o them to s
ing, you could mention the s
ongbook, and i
ts
 
value to the history of Russian culture and Russian music--things you are better
 
able t
o assess than I
.  You would be able t
o assure them that a copy placed in
 
t
he Smithsonian or the Library of Congress would be safe forever from commercial
 
exploitation, but available to Molokan s
tudents and future scholars.
 I think I
 
have t
ried this before, but I have no authority, and you do.
 
A s
econd point i
s that I heard a group of Molokan women s
inging at the
 
Molokan picnic, and the melodies were s
o close to the hymns, that I asked
 
about i
t.  My informant s
aid that her forefathers were from the Voronezh area,
 
and that was the s
tyle.  This woman has two daughters who married out--an
 
event she i
s t
aking very hard.  She said that she and her friends had taped a
 
l
arge reel of folk songs so that after they were gone someone would be able to
 
2
 6
 
use them.
 I think i
f I were t
o ask her, she would give me a copy of the tapes,
 
but in my case i
t would be almost as if I were to start a collection of hiking
 
boots.  In other words, musicologists should be in possession of the tapes.
 
Now, what can I do?  I
t r
eally hurts t
o know about these things and not be
 
able t
o deal with them.  Can you help?
 
I look forward t
o hearing from you.  By the way, I never got a c
opy of the
 
program you promised.
 
Yours,
 
Mrs. S
tephen P
. Dunn

October '0, 1075
 
Dear Fess,
 
Towards the end of my i
ob with the '
75 Festival, you asked if
 
I might one day write you a small opinion pertaining to the strengths
 
and weaknesses of the event as I saw them in my capacity as grounds
 
crew worker.
 I have never forgot your request, but t
ime and cir-
cumstances of the past two and a half months have prevented my cor-
respondence.  With my recent stint as f
ield researcher in Iowa, I
 
can now view the reality of the f
estival from another angle.
 It
 
would be difficult to run the entire gamut of my reactions, so I
 
will say a f
ew things only about those areas I think might be
 
greatly enriched by better planning on the part of the staff.
 It
 
is easier and more helpful to criticize, anyway,at this time.
 
Overall ; the California presentation was much more informative
 
and enlightening, I feel, f
rom the spectators point of v
iew.
 Two
 
main observations are my rationale.
 For one, i
t i
s apparent that
 
the f
ield researchers OR the Smithsonian staff shirked their
 
responsibilities towards agriculture and farm folklore of The
 
Great Plains Region.
 A f
ew paltry crops and two brand new tractors
 
that stood like museum pieces were almost a waste of space and
 
money.
 The tractor pulls, rather the manner in which they were
 
conducted, might as well never had taken place.
 I think that Farl
 
Sampson d
id his research well, but failed somewhere in communication
 
with the FAF because many of his ideas never came off.
 If a family
 
comes to lasso calves, brand calves, or even slaughter calves, then
 
they should have the opportunity.
 If the Smithsonian knows they
 
won't allow these events, why bring the participants?  Sure, they
 
branded the walls of the barn once in a while, still the display
 
was very below what a larger scope would have meant to the audiences.
 
With the crops appearing lonesome and 1
c
'75 machinery undemonstrated
 
or talked about, very few people gained any understanding of the
 
continuum of farm l
ife on the midwest plains f
rom early p
ioneer
 
days ; nor d
id anyone or anything seek to communicate the traditions
 
of rural l
ife.
 The sheep shearing was f
ine and worthwhile, the music
 
was o
.k.  (
though always distant_except the Indians).
 Put why no
 
farm crafts l
ike rope-making, spinning, sod and wood construction,
 
farming, etc.
 Certainly there is room and participants avaTiable.
 
The second major fault, and one which was somewhat remedied by
 
California, was the entire communication aspect of the FAF.
 I was
 
shocked to f
ind thousands of booklets of recepies of the region, none
 
of which were given out because they lay hiden until the week was
 
past.  Why wasn't there an extensive bibliography and record collection
 
available in the selling stall for this region 9 The stall might as
 
well have been a small log cabin.  Workshop stages for musicians
 
would have brought them closer to the audience making instrument
 
demonstrations and songs, stories, etc,  given on a more informal
 
and meaningful plane.  More informative signs at the craft displays
 
would have helped some of the shy participants and spectators.
 
I think also that the entire publicity of what exactly a
 
visotor to the FAF can f
ind each week in Regional America should
 
be beefed up.
 For instance.
, in the program there was only a mass
 
listing of the range, hidden in an inconspicuous l
isting.
 I f
eel
 
that if visitors would realize the extent of the crafts, for instance,
 
they would seek out specific interesting items instead of f
lowing
 
along with the crowds.
 Usually they are at the mercy of seeing only
 
what they run into.
 The schedule of musical events serves that area
 
well, the same idea could be carried over to crafts, agriculture, etc.
 
I
t would also benefit the area to incorperate into the schedule
 
more events like the Portuguese milking parade.
 These type of
 
f
estivals have a real place in each region of the country ; depending
 
of course on the nature of the lifestyles and ethnogenic background
 
of the peoples of the region.
 But those evnts where the maiority
 
of an area participate, and where each lends their own particular
 
f
uncti&n, these '
mini'festivals tend to communicate the relationships
 
of folk as they work and Flay together.
 To a viewer they don't
 
seem so sterile and '
museum-like' as seperate demonstrations.
 
The California i
'resentation was the best I
've ever seen in
 
Regional America, no kidding.  Much more crowd prticipations, more
 
varied presentations, a semi working book and record stall, better
 
research-presentation communication- these are some of my reasons.
 
I was sorry to see the Charros not able to demonstrate in the ring,
 
on the other hand the music styles and performers were a beautiful
 
blending of the traditions of the state, a state which is a curious
 
blend of traditions itself.
 
Well Bess, pardon my typing errors and fleeting of thoughts. You
 
see, in f
ive hours I leave for a six -month stay in Ireland and I
'm
 
beginning to feel quite nervous about it,
 Traditional Irish music
 
and the Gaelic language are my primark reasons for going.
 I hope
 
to spend most of my time in the Galway area, but who knows what will
 
happen?  Maybe a roving street musician,
 So, I
'll drop you a l
ine
 
from over there and tell you of magical adventures and other ideas of
 
FAF as they happen ; which I
'm sure of.
 
One other thing I must ask of you.
 Could you please remind
 
Charely Camp that he must get in contact with each of the persons
 
in Iowa I talked to.
 I promised them all the Smithsonian would
 
provide an adress for questions, cancellations, etc, and also be
 
assured that I had told the FAF about each.
 I
'm sorry I
'm not there
 
to do this myself, I thought the Froceedure was automatic, and
 
I
'm upset that Regional has done this.
 It i
s inconsiderate to me and
 
the Iowans I contacted.  Thank you for your help,
 
'
?
fake care of yourself Bess, I know you must be working hard
 
on 1
.976, and I
'm happy that I will be back working for presentations
 
that you've had a hand in.
 Hopefully B
.C. May and Regional will
 
hire me as ground's crew chief for Regional next summer.
 So, till
 
I see you...

The Aucrustin Lira affair

-
i
 
Mrs. kahm has forwarded from Santa Monica the enclosed recristered mail
 
receipts indicating that Mr. Bernstein's office in Fresno did indeed
 
receive the xerox of the field report and the copy of :
q
tr. Lira's tape
 
that she was asked to send.
 
I hope these prove to be the final documents connected with this matter.
 
July 28, 1975
 
To:  Jim
 
From:  Bess
 
Subject:  attached correspondence
 
Aucyastin Lira, a Chicano singer and songwriter, was recorded in the
 
s--
ring of 7
.975 by two California field workers assigned to develop a
 
farm worker Presentation.  They recommended him very highly it  their
 
field report which they sent me in May along with a tape of Mr. Lira
 
singing four of his songs.
 
I later decided not to invite Mr. Lira on three grounds:  he was not
 
himself a farm worker, his music was more urban-based than rural, and
 
I was informed that he was a prima donna personality.  He was sent the
 
same letter T se
.r
,i all the artists that I did not select, thanking him
 
for his courtesv and saying that z record of his artistic achievement
 
would be retained in the Smithsonian files in hopes that budgetary
 
increases would make it possible to consider him for the 1976 festival.
 
Durina ml fisrt week here, I received a call from Peter Powers, whc
 
forwarded a copy of the attached
. letter from Mr. Lira's lawyer. I
 
explained the circumstances to Mr. Powers, who wrote the attached
 
letter agreeding that Mr. Lira's tape would be returned to him along
 
with a copy of the field workers' report.  Since that report was
 
highly complimentary, I see no possibility that Mr. Lira could take
 
further offense.
 
I have telephoned Barbara Rahm, who is in charge of my California files,
 
asking her to return the materials by registered mail to Mr. Lira.  So
 
far as I know, this has been done, and I hope this will conclude the
 
matter
_ without any further unpleasantness.
 I am sorry not to have
 
reported to you on this, but I am still not totally clear on just what
 
level the various kinds of problems crossing my desk are to be handled.

We have received your letter of the 20th of June with considerable
 
concern.
 First, we request the immediate return of all copies of
 
the audition tapes which includes the songs "Ser Como E1 Aire
 
Libre", and "La Peregrinacion".
 This material was furnished to
 
Mr. Heisley during April, 1975, solely for the use of audition
 
purposes for the 1975 Festival of American Folklife.
 No permission,
 
either verbal or written was given for the retention, dissemination
 
or any other use of this material.
 You, as well as Mr. Heisley and
 
Mr. Singer will be held personally responsible for any unauthorized
 
use of this material.
 
Second, under the Freedom of Information Act as amended, we request
 
the right to examine, and if we wish, to ask for the "file" you
 
have prepared on Mr. Agustin Lira and any other information you have
 
on Mr. Lira to be turned over to E1 Teatro de la Tierra, Inc.  As
 
you know, the Act requires prompt disclosure, and we will expect
 
your reply within 10 days.
 
Thank you in advance for your cooperation in this regard.
 
Very truly yours,

She is completing her PhD in Anthropology with a specialization in
 
folklore at the University of California in Berkeley; her theils topic
 
is a comparison between the Portuguese Easter festival in Gustine,
 
California and the Azores.  I
ds. Salvador's husband, Vern Salvador, is
 
Portuguese by descent (
Marilyn is not) and a lawyer in San Francisco.
 
The two of them plan to spend next year in the Azores, starting during
 
the fall of 1975.
 
Then there is
 
Joanne Purcell
 
15035 Greenleaf Street
 
Sherman Oaks, California

She has completed (
ithink) her PhD in Portuguese studies at UCLA with
 
a specialization in folklore, and is currently teaching part time at
 
the University of Southern California.  Her husband, Ronald Purcell,
 
teaches music (
classical guitar) at California State University at
 
Northridge.  The two of them plan to spend the summer of 1975 in
 
Portugal, where Joanne will be teaching in some kind of special insti-
tute on Portuguese and Portuguese-American studies in Lisbon.

1
.  CHICANOS  Since no charro presentation within proper context seems
 
i
rricfs ble, my �
7
iew is that the charro association will decline the
 
Smithsonian's invitation.  This throws the entire Chicano presentation
 
into some disarray.  Currently we are still planning to include the
 
f3l'owing items
 
c
Lr
' 
muralists:  three well-known
 of the East
 
Los Angeles community will paint a mural (
location undecided) on the general
 
topic of the Chicano presentation on the mall.  I
t will be painted on canvas
 
for easier transportation and will be re-presented to the community upon
 
its arrival back home.  The mural will be brought in various s
tages of com-
pletion so that festival goers on each of the f
ive days will have an example
 
of how a mural is constructed.  On Sunday, the muralists would l
ike to have
 
their mural formally dedicated.
 
crafts -
- paper f
lower making, pinata making, will be demonstrated
 
and flower making taught the spectator:z.  Bread dough sculpture and paper
 
mache sculpture are additicnal optior
,
 
cooking -
- masa griadin;, tortilla making and tamale making
 
will be demonstrated in the cookin-  ­
�,nt .
 
corrido concert -
- a s
r
,ccial concert including traditional
 
corridos from the Mexican r
.evoluti
"r,_
:ry period, farm worker corridos and
 
contemporary urban corridos, trars'_itions to be f
lashed on a rear screen.
 
farm worker present
"atLjn -
- a special concert concentrating on
 
the farm worker repertoire.  Cur-^,t-ly we are considering an organizer-
singer from Calexico and a group consisting of two 60 year old brothers,
 
a 60 year o
ld neighbor and a yov Z daughter from Delano.  (
This group would
 
also participate in the corrido -oncert -
- personnel: guitar, violin,
 
trumpet (
discreet) and two s
ingers; total 4
.)
 (""c j"'rn
:f"ed
 
I will try to l
o�
-atc s
ome extra impressiven music or craft to
 
make up for the xNx charros.
 
2
.  CHINESE  Shadow Play: a 45 minute presentation which can be given twice
 
daily but, s
ince it is l
iterally an enchanting production, should be shared
 
with the childrens' section.  Per:ormance includes demonstration and explana-
tion of the puppet figur.�s.
 
Crafts.  Mrs. Ung, a d
istinguished craftswoman, will demonstrate
 
kite making of both northern and souther_z China (
together with explanations of
 
the s
tyles and principles involved); she wi11 a
lso demonstrate paper cuts.
 
Further she will supervise the teaching of how to make folded paper kites and

.  MOLOKANS.  These remarkable people will s
imply s
ing and explain their
 
traditions and past history.  They will serve not only to demonstrate
 
California's peculiar tolerance for religious variance but also to provide
 
a choral sound that is absolutely unique.
 I
t is possible they may wish to
 
demonstrate a special greeting ceremonial together with the making of tea
 
in a samovar, but this has not been worked out.
 
4
.  PORTUGUESE.
 Fishing tradition.
 
Joseph Silva, foremost tuna boat designer of the US will demonstrate
 
boat design and illustrate model testing methods in the reflecting pool.
 (
His
 
current model is 8 feet l
ong; it can be tested for speed with varying bows
 
attached and the stabilizer principle can be demonstrated by putting some
 
youngsters in the reflecting pool with boards to make waves.)  Additionally,
 
net making and lure making will be demonstrated by local fishermen plus, hope-
fully, the singing of Portuguese sea and work chanteys.
 
Dairying tradition.
 
Preparation for the major festival of California Portuguese, the
 
`
�Festa da Espiritu Santu" will be demonstrated by the following activities:
 
Making of Portuguese sweet bread (
in fancy braids and coils)
 
Construction of paper f
lowers which are sewn into blankets and
 
garlands to decorate the black and white Holstein cows
 
Regular milking demonstrations in the barn
 
Rehearsal of the chamaritas, the traditional Portuguese square
 
dance, which will be demonstrated and taught the spectators.
 
The final celebration will involve parading the decorated cows
 
through the festival accompanied by the orchestra and participants, ceremonial
 
milking, a milk and bread feast, the singi'of desafio (
a traditional contest
 
between solo singers who improvise verses), and a final chamaritas in which
 
the audience can join in.
 
Other Portuguese participants include a ballad singer from
 
Madeira, a fado singer, and a small mandolin orchestra.
 
1  
S
.  CUPENOS.  These southern California Indians are extremely anxious to
 
demonstrate the work of their cultural center, the only one among the southern
 
tribes.  They are offering to bring to tae festival the .
following activities:
 
acorn mush making
 
hand games
 
t
raditional dance and song
 
story telling
 
a demonstration of their bi-lingual program, using a few children
 
and some older tribal members as "walking dictionaries".
 
A final determination on the extent of Cupenc participation will be worked out
 
next week when I will visit the tribal council and the cultural center.  .
 
6
.
 BLACKS.  This group includes
 
a fine traditional gospel quartet, 4 brothers, resident all their
 
l
ives in Fresno and proud to have been influenced by the Golden Gate Quartet
 
a Kansas City blues style pianist, who is an excellent singer
 
a blues guitarist, not yet selected
 
hopefully, a black French-speaking ballad s
inger (
Louisiana in
 
origin) now resident in a small black community outside Los Angeles.
 
a .
 
7
.  SOUTHERN WHITES  This contingent will include
 
L
,h,Je, 
a blue-grass quartet who, besides being excellent instrumentalists,
 
sing
 A quartet s
tyle superbly
 
Earl Collins, the remarkable Ozark fiddler, resident in California
 
for the past 2T ye ars
 
n �S.i C
 
 White, back-up guitarist, a 40 (

place in the national f
iddlers contest last year for accompaniment
 
Kenny Hall, blind mandolinist and s
inger
 
Otis Pearce, formerly a member of the Sons of the Pioneers who
 
sings an excellent solo repertoire, plays banjo and jews harp and call squares
 
One back-up f
iddler, not yet settled upon
 
Two additional s
ingers, not yet decided.
 
Activities in this section will include teaching square dances and participation
 
in a whole variety of concerts and workshops.
 
8
. FILIPINOS  We plan to use here
 
a small mandolin orchestra (
3-4 people, o
ldsters)
 
4 young people who will divide their time between the craft tent
 
where they will demonstrate the common home craft of making paper Christmas
 
lanterns (
reaching sometimes 5 feet in height) and the "tinakling", the
 
traditional Philippine stick dance (
demonstrated and taught for audience
 
participation).
 
9
. MEDITERRANEANS
 This presentation is far l
imited to crafts:
 
a Greek father and son who will demonstrate traditional beehive
 
construction out of woven s
traw; the son (
college-educated) can also give in-
formation on bee-keeping and agricultural use of bees
 
an Armenian rug-weaver (
male) and an Armenian wool spinner (
female)
 
an additional participant may be an Assyrian drummer who performs
 
marvellously well in s
olo and who might also fit in well with the Lebanese
 
presentation in OWNW.
 
10.  BELL R
INGERS.
 If the cable car can be present, bell ringing conductors
 
will announce each session at the main California s
tage and dance f
loor.  On
 
one day, at least, of the festival, a formal contest will be held among the
 
ringers;  (
blacks and Irish are among the competitors -
- they show great variance
 
in s
tyles).
 
(
There are at l
east two other possibilities which factors of time and budget
 
may e
liminate: a group of Rumanians s
ingers and dancers recommended by Dick
 
Crum; and three I
talian bagpipe and oboe players recommended by Anna Lomax.)

SPECIAL EVENTS
 
Singles:
 
1
.  Dedication of the Chicano mural
 
2
.  Portuguese "festal'
 
3
.  Chicano party.
 (
With the e
limination of the charros this
 
may not prove practical; we had planned them to host a Chicano-Mexican fiesta
 
with s
inging, dancing, tamale consumption and pinata breaking.)
 
Cross-cultural:
 
1
.  An evening of waltzes (
audience invited to dance) accompanied
 
by the Philippino, Mexican mariachi (
borrowed from OWNW), Portuguese and
 
southern white orchestras.
 
2
.  A mandolin concert featuring Kenny Hall (
a unique technician),
 
the blue-grass mandolin 4
4t, the Portuguese mandolinist and the F
ilipino mandolinists.
 
3
.  A quartet s
ing f
eaturing the Wright Brothers (
the gospel quartet)
 
and the Don Parmely blue-grass band.
 (
This should be smashing.)
 
4
.  A Sunday morning religious c
oncert, including the gospel quartet,
 
the blue-grass orchestra, Otis Pearce (
white s
inger), Earl Collins (
who plays
 
religious tunes on his f
iddle) and possibly the Molokans.  Additional partici-
pation by the other e
thnic groups has not yet been checked out.
 
The basic theme of the California presentation seems to be the celebration of
 
human skills and artistry when given the same basic bank of materials with
 
which to work.  Each culture then uses these materials and skills to produce
 
their own unique traditional contribution to the general artistic health of
 
their own and their neighbor c
ommunities.  We seem to have several unifying
 
themes running throughout the presentation:
 
1
.
 The joy of s
ociable dancing, demonstrated by square dancing,
 
the Portuguese chamaritas, the F
ilipine t
inikling and the waltz evening.
 
2
.
 The grace of food, demonstrated by Chinese, Mexican, Armenian
 
and Portuguese chefs.
 
3
.  '
.
'The usefulness of paper, demonstrated by the Chinese paper
 
cuts, kites and paper f
olding techniques, the Philippine paper l
anterns, the
 
Chicano paper f
lowers, pinatas and paper mache, and the Portuguese paper f
lowers.
 
4
.
 The beauty of the human voice, demonstrated by concerts of
 
s
olo s
inging (
Portuguese, Anglo, French and black) and in groups (
Russian
 
Molokans, Anglos, Chicanos and blacks).
 
S
.
 The e
xcitement of z
�hythm, demonstrated by the cable car bell
 
ringers and the Assyrian drummer.
 
6
.
 The prevalence of the s
tringed instrument in western culture,
 
demonstrated by a
ll the orchestras (
white, Portuguese, Philippino and Chicano)
 
and particularly the importance of the mandolin (
white -
- two s
tyles, Philippine,
 
and Portuguese).
 
S
.
 
All the foregoing will be presented in varying c
ombinations, so that the
 
festival goer can savor the s
imilarities and the d
ifferences that make
 
l
ife both wholesome and s
timulating.
 
These point will be further demonstrated by
 
the California f
ilm program to be shown continuously
 
the educational/informational booth where books, records, and
 
a s
pecial pamphlet surveying California folklife prepared by the California
 
Folklore Society will be available for sale
 
large s
igns throughout the area, each containing an outline map
 
of California on which will be indicated the l
ocation, special contributions
 
and relevant facts concerning each participating group.
 
As a f
inal feature, the natural productivity of California will be demonstrated by
 
the f
lower seller (
selling from a f
lower s
tand -

l
ocated by the cable car, a

Dear
 
r
 
The fol"owing remarks, which I hope you wil
 ead not once but several times
 
before arriving in Washington, are excerpted from a letter Alan Lomax wrote
 
in evaluating last year's festival.  Please take serious note of them.  On
 
our ability to meet the challenges laid down here will depend the success
 
of our presentation on the mall, and, much more importantly, the ultimate
 
e
i
.fect of our presentation on the home communities.
 
.
..I have a mounting feeling, which I have picked up at every festival
 
I have attended, that too many of the people having to do with the choice,
 
the presentation and the care of the singers are not sufficiently versed
 
in the l
iving material of the f
ield to supervise the programming in the
 
festival.  The folk brought to Washington have the whole job and seem
 
l
eft to run their own shows as they see fit, l
argely, I believe, because
 
the personnel s
taff i
s not sufficiently versed in their repertory and
 
thus wisely decide to stay out of the picture.  The performers may know
 
well what i
s to be done at home, or what would have gone over with their
 
audiences thirty years ago, but frequently their presentations could be
 
Improved if they had worked on them a bit with someone who understood
 
them and their problems.
 
I take it that the a
im of this festival i
s not just to make America proud
 
of
, its folklore but to p
xovide support for the big river of oral tradition
 
which i
s now being diss.pated and corrupted a
ll over the planet.  We
 
cannot foresee what we world do if we did not have this river of pure
 
creativity always revivi'ying our culture, but l
ife would be a very sorry
 
thing if it i
s dried up.  The festival beats a big drum for folklore on
 
a national l
evel, but it is doubtful whether this i
s of much use to the
 
separate traditions and to their carriers -
- for these traditions are
 
l
ocal and their carriers depend on l
ocal audiences.
 In my mind then, the
 
most important thing that the festival can do i
s t
o aid and s
trengthen
 
the s
ingers (
performers).  As a performer myself, I know that bad experiences
 
with ignorant audiences can turn you off for l
ife.
 
I know that when an authentic performer i
s topped by a non-authentic one,
 
and the non-authentic gets the big hand, the genuine performer may be hurt
 
for l
ife.  The festival thus may damage s
ingers.  For this reason there
 
needs to be somebody always on hand at the performances who is taking
 
care that these real and sensitive people that you bring from quiet places
 
into noisy Washington are not hurt.  I think that most of them might be
 
easily helped, provided the staff makes sure that they not only receive
 
l
ots of TLC on the festival grounds, but are treated a b
=
.t l
ike royalty.
 
They are indeed royalty, each one an important artist in his own genre,
 
and i
t i
s their privilege to have temperament and be taken care of if they
 
are being a
sked to exhibit on your big stages.
 
But the TLC should go further than that.  I
t should be using the festival
 
period to help develop the confidence of the artist, his sense of his worth
 
in comparison to.other artists and other aesthetic traditions so that when
 
he � 
)
e
� 
-
 back Tome he can work more confiden;
:ly in hls own community.
 
2
.
 
When I was young, I spent time with Guthrie, Leadbelly, Josh White, Burl
 
Ives and others, and I consider the time I gave them the most valuable
 
cultural work I ever did.
 If I was helpful, it was because I care very
 
much for the s
ingers' art and what they had to say...
 
This i
s a new profession, this folklorist work with culture.  I
t can't
 
be carried out with show biz standards -
- "We've got that performance
 
off the stage, thank God, now l
et's get on with the next and get away
 
sickly to the party afterward."  There should not be a s
ingle person at
 
`
the festival who feels that way, because the opportunity you have during
 
those weeks i
s to strengthen the carriers of all kinds of cultures for
 
the bitter hard struggles they have at home, faced with T
.V. and indifference,
 
pretty largely.  In other words, I feel that the s
taff should be oriented
 
to work l
ike devoted and wise young angels with the artists who come to
 
the grounds...
 
Lastly, on the question of authenticity, scientific aestheticians have
 
shown that well-trained art experts agree in their choices of the "best"
 
with people from the oral traditions themselves, even when they are not
 
members of these traditions.  This finding about art applies also to folklore
 
and culture.  The folklorist and the anthropologist and the devoted amateur
 
improve their perceptions of the quality of the activity or l
ore they
 
become interested in.  They are the protectors of this part of the human
 
environment.  We must depend upon the folklore expert and the anthropologist,
 
whose job it is to care about the quality of culture, to keep the festival
 
at the high standard it has so far maintained, and to improve that standard.
 
We do not yet have a science of folklore, therefore the s
tandards of
 
authenticity carried by the performers on the one hand, and the scholars
 
on the other, are a
ll we've got to keep the river not just pure, but to
 
keep it f
lowing at all...
 
With the above remarks in mind, I should l
ike to e
stablish the following ground
 
rules foroall presentations in the California section:
 
1
.  No concert, workshop or other major performance i
s to take place without a
 
field-worker-presenter being there throughout.  He/she should start the event
 
off and set the tone.  I
t i
s also the field worker's responsibility to stop the
 
session reasonably on time, c
losing out, if possible on an up-beat so that everyone
 
goes away feeling successful.
 
2
.  When the presenter is working with articulate performers, he/she may not need
 
to m
.c. in any formal sense.
 I
t is important for the festival goers to experience
 
the performers not only as artists but as thoughtful and interesting human beings
 
a
s well; many of our performers are quite capable of providing their own commentary,
 
and this should be encouraged.  Some may best be presented in terms of a quiet
 
interview, the presenter remaining on s
tage, asking occasional questions and
 
suggesting interest
-ing tunes or reminding the performer of good stories and the
 
l
ike.  Translations ran often be handled effectively this way.  Other good talkers
 
may be able to take over entirely on their own.
 I
t still remains the responsibility
 
of the presenter to control the overall pace and effect of the show; he should
 
stand ready az a
ll times to intervene tactfully _f anything whatever is interfering
 
with our goal: to present the traditiop
.s
_1 artists of California in their very
 
best l
ight.
 
3
.
 
3
.  This kind of self-effacing program guidance requires two things:
 
that the presenter be quite familiar with the performer's repertoire. You
 
should work out a list of songs and tunes and games and stories between you and
 
carry it with you,
 a1;
1,44m4s�.  The performer, under unfamiliar pressures, may
 
forget his best material; you should be ready to remind him.
 
that the presenter and performer(s) work out a program together in advance.  
This can vary in presentational detail from a completely scheduled and ordered
 
list of songs to be sung to a "let's each one play the first fiddle tune he ever
 
learned" idea.  However, no performer should get up on one of those stages with-
out having some kind of idea of what he is expected to do, and without some prior
 
feedback from his field worker as to what is the most effective way to do it.
 
4
.
 All concerts or workshops should include some informational content. Our pur-
pose is to excite and interest as well as entertain; but excitement can be
 
engendered by presenting not only new songs and new music and dances, but by
 
new ideas and new information also, to stretch our listeners' horizons a bit.
 
Long speeches should obviously be avoided; however, some little item of substance
 
should be a requisite of every program.  This can be done on several levels:
 
Folkloric or ethnomusicological commentary.  When you are planning this,
 
please be sure your information is as accurate as possible.
 I have heard shockingly
 
inaccurate remarks tossed off at folk music concerts.
 
Historical or geographic commentary.
 Remarks about the history of your own
 
performers' people in California would be of interest to most Easterners.  Bear in
 
mind that we have a bibliography on California available in the newsletter, the
 
Sour Dough Crock, as well as an extremely well selected s
tock of paperback books
 
on California for sale at the book s
tall under the supervision of Nicky Daval,
 
a young l
ibrarian who i
s well up on the available l
iterature.  Festival goers who
 
stump you may be referred to her.
 
General remarks about the themes of the California presentation.  These have
 
worked out to be very simple, but they, are worth s
tating here:
 
A
.  California i
s in a temperate c
limate with a year-round growing season; we
 
are thus the most important food-producing state in the union.  To easterners
 
who perhaps have only flown into San Francisco or Los Angeles, this will come
 
as a real surprise; they appear to think of us as a cluster of industrial
 
metropolises separated by desert.  Many of the peoples represented by our
 
perfmrmers came here originally as agricultural workers:  Philippi lI Portuguese,
 
Chicanos, many Chinese, Anglos from the rural south, etc.  The year-round
 
climate, moreover, gives our farm workers a chance at more residential s
tability;
 
in the east, farm workers must move the year l
ong from s
tate to state.
 
B
.  In s
pite of a really s
triking degree of surface conformity in terms of
 
public behaviors, Californians have retained their e
thnicity to an equally
 
striking degree.  We do not know if this i
s unique to California; we only
 
know that this i
s what we have found here.  In my visiting round the state,
 
this has been the most impressive feature; a
lmost every l
ivingroom I have
 
been in has been alike -
- a
ll nice conventional middle-class-style homes -
-
almost everyone dressed a
like -
- s
lacks and sport shirts for the men, fashionable
 
pant suits and bouffant hairdos for the women.  But the homeland languages are
 
still a
live, from Assyrian to Russian to Chinese to Tagalog; the cuisines
 
are s
till. a
live; the music and dance and s
tories are s
till there, and still
 
beautiful.
 I
t has made me wonder if perhaps the surface conformity may not
 
serve the crucial function of a
llowing a
ll these extraordinarily varied
 
populations to l
ive together in a degree of social peace, while maintaining
 
their uniqueness in a decent privacy.
 
4
.
 
C
.  California traditional arts, a
s e
lsewhere, are learned in the family -
-
most frequently handed down from grand-parent to parent to child.  We did
 
not set out to prove this; it s
imply emerged from the fieldwork.  Almost no
 
group appearing in our presentation i
s without a familial representation,
 
we have four brothers (
the black gospel quartet), a three-generation
 
family of fiddlers, f
ive Chicano artists and cooks of the same family
 
(
mother, son, two daughters and daughter-in-law), e
tc. e
tc.  This s
imple
 
fact -
- the way tradition works -
- i
s worth pointing out to our audiences
 
from time to t
ime.  I
t may cause them to re-evaluate and re-examine their
 
own family traditions.
 
5
.  As a last point, I think I must make plain that all the foregoing requirements
 
add up to a potentially unnerving conclusion: as practicing cultural workers, you
 
are going to have to make choices on the mall, with and for your people.  This i
s
 
applied folklore with a vengeance, and this realization may be difficult for some
 
folklorists and anthropologists whose training has been to observe and not interfere.
 
Here, interference will be required of you, s
ince many of the ultimate decisions
 
will be yours.  Don't l
et this throw you; because of your friendship with and
 
knowledge of your performers, you are the best qualified persons there are to do
 
this particular job.  So be confident and represent your people the best way you
 
know how.  I
t will probably be the best way there i
s.
 
At the end of this excruciatingly l
ong letter (
I am reminded of the great Oscar
 
Wilde l
ine -
- "
I am in too much haste to write briefly"), I should l
ike to say
 
that I am very proud of the l
evel of work that has been carried on in California,
 
both in field research and in the endless details of assembling this presentation
 
and bringing a
ll 1
12 of our performers to Washington in good health and spirits.
 
You have a
ll shown the highest l
evel of social responsibility; the Smithsonian
 
could not possibly afford to pay for the volunteer hours you all have worked, and
 
the thought and expertise you have put into your recommendations.  I think we will
 
all find ourselves rewarded on the mall when the lovely things we have planned
 
together c
ome into reality, but I
'd l
ike to say a personal thank-you to each one
 
right now.

JUST A FEW REMAINING DETAILS...
 
1
.  I am enclosing the schedule for the California presentation which will be
 
printed in the festival brochure.  We only learned of the deadline the day it
 
came to pass, s
o there was no time to consult you and l
ittle t
ime to consider.
 
Please go over i
t carefully and note any discrepancies or necessary revisions.
 
Then please jot down the names of the participants for which you are responsible
 
under the times when they will be appearing.  This l
ist should be mailed or
 
phoned to us (
213-450-3112).  We want to be able to give each participant his
 
own personal schedule before we begin.  Please also schedule yourselves (
as
 
presenters) and don't over-do i
t; we have enough people to fill in.
 
For your information, "c" before a l
isting indicates a concert; "w" means a
 
workshop (
including informal presentations with audience questioning, interviews,
 
audience participation activities, etc.)  One asterisk (
*) means that the event
 
will take place on the main stage with the associated dance f
loor; two (
**)
 
means the workshop stage facing the reflecting pool; three (
***) means the
 
second workshop s
tage, l
ocation at present unsettled.
 
A separate schedule i
s attached for the craft workers and the cook tent.  There
 
will be a few "roving" performers, e
specially Mr. Concepcion, our Philippine
 
yo-yo expert; a
lso the Portuguese ladies are being invited to bring their
 
crochet and s
imply sit around where they can chat with the needle-workers in
 
the audience.  Since these people are not being formally presented, they do not
 
have assigned field workers and are thus in danger of feeling l
onely or
 
unappreciated or over-worked.  I would greatly appreciate it if each field
 
worker would keep an especial eye out for them.
 
2
.  At the Regional Head
 Parters (
air conditioned!!!) will be Diana Parker,
 
who is in charge of all performers in the area and Dorothy Newman, who i
s in
 
charge of a
ll physical supplies.  Bill McNeill, Charles Camp, Barbara Rahm
 
and I will a
ll be working out of the Headwuarters, and there are several
 
volunteer runners as well.  Don't s
it andtsuff
-er; l
et us know what's wrong.
 
3
. Each evening immediately after supper at Marymount there will be a brief
  
meeting of all field workers and presenters for a resume of the day's problems.
 
This is a must, but I promise to keep it short.
 
4
.  Lastly, please paste the following in your hat, or keep it otherwise always
 
accessible.
 In the participants' insturctions, the telephone number that i
s
 
l
isted a
s the one to be called if anybody i
s lost or in difficulties i
s the
 
l
ine to the general Smithsonian switchboard.  Presenters, or any participant
 
who might conceivably get into trouble, should instead call Diana, who will
 
answer the following number:
 (
202) 3
81-6741.  Diana i
s a kind of miracle
 
worker, and a
ll problems can be safely deposited with her.
 
ADDENDUM  (
Not required, but you would get an extra s
tring on your heavenly
 
harp if you could do this)  Please try to notify your local newspaper or radio/TV
 
station about the performers who will be going from their town.  I
t would be
 
marvellous for the l
ocal communities to see their own artists' pictures in the
 
paper or on the tube.  Again, i
t's what happens at home that's really important.
 
COOKING DEMONSTRATION SCHEDULE
 
The cooking area contains two complete kitchens, facing in opposite directions
 
with an additional small unit on the s
ide between.  Thus we can carry on two
 
different cooking demonstrations s
imultaneously while f
inishing-up work or
 
smaller operations can occupy the l
ittle unit.  Announcement boards will be
 
posted at each end of the cooking area; these are plastic and the day's "menus"
 
can be written on them with crease pencil and changed, when necessary, as the
 
day goes on.
 
We have worked out the following suggested schedule for the cooking demonstrations;
 
field workers should discuss the schedule with the cooks in their groups to
 
determine if the times allotted are practical.
 It will be hot there; don't
 
let your chefs overdo.  Clean-up and set-up cooperation will be of course essential.

the small kitchen unit for a demonstration between 2
:00 and 3
:30 while the
 
Portuguese baking goes on.  Also the Assyrian ladies will be very busy spinning,
 
baking and helping with the dance demonstrations; daily tea making may be too much.
 
An
t�T'
.Jut to lunch" s
ign is always a possibility.

 CRAFT TENT SCHEDULE
 
There will be three craft tents, each with a plastic announcement board as above.
 
Please work out suitable schedules among the crafts people so that some activity
 
i
s taking place in each tent at all times between 1
1:00 and 5
:00.
 Both crafts
 
and cooking demonstrations must close at 5
:00 so that materials can be secured
 
for the night.
 
A nearby table arrangement will be set up for paper craft teaching; a schedule
 
for use of this area should be worked out between the Chicano and Chinese craft
 
workers.
 In between teaching sessions, the Portuguese ladies might wish to ex-
pand into this area during the early part of the week in order to prepare the
 
decorations for their festa on Saturday; it might also be used by our crocheters
 
when not needed for craft teaching purposes.
 
Tent #1.
 
Greek bee hive making
 
Assyrian drop spindle spinning
 
Knife and scissors sharpening
 
Tent #2
 Chinese paper crafts and kite making
 
Philippine paper lantern making
 
Tent #3
 Mexican pinata and paper f
lower making
 
Portuguese paper f
lower making
 
Special note to craftspeople:  Scissors Sam is a knife and scissors sharpener
 
who works entirely by hand, using files, and has published a small book on
 
the art of sharpening small tools at home.  Crafts workers and cooks are
 
invited to give their tools to Scissors Sam for his expert attention; personally,
 
I intend to bring a
long all the dull scissors I have around the place -
-
after all, he has to have something to demonstrate with!

Dear Sr. Nunez-Gomez:
 
�

Thank you for your letter.  The Festival was indeed very successful,
 
and the California -anticipants Were, I thought, especially strong
 
and effectjve.  They care front varfed national backgrounds  Filipino,
 
Russian
., Portuguese. Irish, and, of course, ;
4exican.  All were
 
working people: fishermen, boat builders, dairy farmers, builders,
 
farm wormers, and so on.  The farm workers came from the central
 
valley (
Pee
-re Salud On and his daughter, Juanita) and the Im,
-erial
 
Valley,  (your friend, Al Figueroa and throe of his children).  Perhaps
 
Al has told you about the festival already.
 
Concernina your songs, the young man who called on you, Mike Heisley
 
and Merril ringer, recorded you reading sotae of your poems to z
 
musical accompaniment.  I have that tape in n1 files in Santa Monica
 
and, if I
rou wish, I will ask m
ay friend, Barbara Rahm,  to send you a
 
list of just which poems are on it.  *
ms. neisley and Mr. Singer also
 
gave me copies of the words of the poems you recorded which they had
 
found printed in E1 Macreado, and we have those in the files.  I do
 
not believe we have any poems of yours which •
A
nere na already in print
 
in E1 Macreado. Should you want the tape or the copies of the poems
 
returned to you, please let me }
:now; otherwise we  will keep them as
 
part of the Smithsonian archives.  Mrs. Rahm will be shirping all my
 
files to me in Washington by the end of next month.
 
When Iou next soe Al Figueroa, -please give him my warmest regards and
 
my best wishes for the success of his school.  And I thank you again
 
for your help in our project.
 
Yours very sincerely,

Dear Ms. Wenger:
 
I returned from vacation to f
ind your letter seeking information
 
concerning Joyce P
. Bynum unanswered on n
iy desk.  I hope this
 
c
lues not come too late.
 
1`�/
 
I f
irst m
et Joyce Bynum in 1970, when she and I were bpth d
-oing
 
graduate work at the University of California at Lerkeley.  t
`
?e because
 
friends and have remained in occasional touch since then.  She
 
impressed r
oe at the time as an intelligent and mature woman, with
 
a l
ively sense of humor (
which to me always indicates a useful sense
 
of proportion as well).  She was an excellent student and a generous
 
colleague, volunteering to translate some German material I needed
 
for my thesis.
 
During; the spring of 1975, while employed as Professor of Anthropology
 
at California State University at 2
torthridge, I was asked to take
 
on the additional job of preparing a presentation of Cuifornia
 
folkways for the Smithsonian's annual Festival of American Folklife.
 
For this work, I required the services of a number of field workers,
 
and immediately remembered r
ay old friend, Joyce Bynum.  She took on
 
the not inconsiderably job of locating a whole variety of traditional
 
artists in the San Francisco area.  Her work was exceptionally
 
thorough, sensitive, and professional; and during it she demonstrated
 
c
learly her ability to deal with a
ll kinds of people from a whole
 
range of races and nationalities.
 
'
.
y
 personal view i
s that Joyce will brink; a great deal to any job she
 
undertakes.  She i
s mature; she has a great affection for the ordinary
 
run of h
iMan beings.  I think you would be lucky to get her.
 
Cordially,

To Whom i
t May Concern:
 
I have known Ms.  Joyce Bynum for t
he past ten years.
 During t
he
 
summer of 1
975 , she worked u
nder my supervision on a r
esearch
 
project for t
he Smithsonian I
nstitution, where I am temporarily
 
employed during a year's l
eave from my r
egular job a
s Professor
 
of Anthropology at California State University at Northridge.
 
Ms. B
ynum worked a
s a f
ield r
esearcher, preparing a presentation
 
of t
raditional California folklife for t
he 1
975 Festival of American
 
Folklife sponsored by t
he Smithsonian.
 During t
he cours-e of her
 
duties, s
he i
nterviewed numerous people i
n t
he northern California
 
area.
 Her f
ield r
eports were models -
- concisely written,  i
nformative
 
and t
horough.
 She obviously possesses a
ll the r
equisite skills
 
for any k
ind of office work; s
he takes excellent notes a
nd i
s a
 
fast accurate t
ypist.
 During t
he F
estival  i
tself, Ms. Bynum
 
supervised t
he performance of some of t
he California participants
 
and acted a
s an i
nformal "M.C.".  She speaks well  i
n public and
 
was friendly and p
leasant to a
ll - a n
ice person t
o have around.
 
Overall,  I
 was greatly impressed by t
he calibre of Ms. Bynum's
 
work.
 She i
s t
hat present-day r
arity -
- a woman who i
s not only
 
competent but conscientious and not afraid of r
esponsibility.
 She
 
i
s hard-working i
n t
he extreme, and I
 would r
ecommend her i
n t
he
 
h
ighest terms f
or a

ake on.
 I k
now s

would do i

Dear Bess,
 
I didn't get a chance to send you a Christmas card,  since
 
I went to Texas.
 (
Guess what? My daughter said she would
 
pay half my plane fare to go there.
 Isn't that a switch?)
 
Anyway,  I was gone almost all of December.
 So,  a belated
 
Happy New Year to you,  with wishes  for success in your
 
work and a lot of HEALTH and HAPPINESS.
 
Could you do me a favor and write me a "TO WHOM IT MAY
 
CONCERN"  letter about my work with the National Folklife
 
Festival?
 I have your nice letter,  but when I show it to
 
people who want a Secretary,  they look at the part about
 
beehives and Assyrians and get a strange look on their
 
faces.
 I have had a devil of a time getting a secretarial
 
job,  not because my skills aren';t good,  which they are,  but
 
because the job situation is so tight,  and my experience
 
in office work is rather scanty.
 Perhaps you could just
 
say what I did - interviewing,  writing reports,  acting as
 
"M.C."  at the Festival,  supervising,  etc.,  and how I did it.
 
Also,  I worked for the Festival  from March to July 1975.
 
I would really appreciate this,  Bess.
 Hopefully I will get
 
a paying job soon.
 Next term I will be teaching a folklore
 
course at SF State gratis,  but I still have to work during
 
the day.
 Right now I have a temporary job as Legal Secretary
 
at United Airlines,  but they can't hire me for the job be-
cause I
' m not a minority!
 When they do have an opening,
 
I am sure I am a likely candidate,  since the man here likes
 
my old-fashioned attitude  (you know,  conscientious and
 
serious about my job).
 I have been told so many times that
 
I am "OVERQUALIFIED"  that I am thinking of suing for dis-
crimination.
 =  I suppose people think if you have a good
 
education that you won't want to work.
 
My daughter is expecting my first grandchild,  so of course
 
I have started knitting a baby blanket,  and I even went out
 
and bought an antique doll house:
 (Daft,  what?)
 
Take good care of yourself,  and give my best regards to
 
your sister.
 
Love,

who plays
 
religious tunes on his f

pation by the other e
thnic groups has not yet been checked out.
 
The basic theme of the California presentation seems to be the celebration of
 
human s
kills and artistry when given the same basic bank of materials with
 
which to work.  Each culture then uses these materials and skills to produce
 
their own unique traditional contribution to the general artistic health of
 
their own and their neighbor c
ommunities.  We s
eem to have several unifying
 
themes running throughout the presentation:
 
1
.
 The joy of s
ociable dancing, demonstrated by square dancing,
 
the Portuguese chawaritas, the
- Filipine t
inikling and the waltz evening.
 
2
.
 The grace of f
ood, demonstrated by Chinese, Mexican, Armenian
 
and Portuguese chefs.
 
3
.  TThc usefulness of paper, demonstrated by the Chinese paper
 
cats, kites and paper f
olding techniques, the Philippine paper l
anterns, the
 
Chicano paper f
lowers, pinatas and paper u
u►che, and the Portuguese paper f
lowers.
 
4
.
 The beauty of the hwnan voice, demonstrated by concerts of
 
solo s
inging (
Portuguese, Anglo, French and b
lack) and in groups (
Russian
 
Molokans, Anglos, Chicanos and b
lacks).
 
S
.
 The excitement of 1hythm, demonstrated by the cable car bell
 
ringers and the Assyrian drummer.
 
6
.  The prevalence of the s
tringed instrument in western culture,
 
demonstrated by a
ll t
he orchestras (
white, Portuguese, Philippino and Chicano)
 
and particularly the i
mportance of the mandolin (
white -
- two s
tyles, Philippine,
 
and Portuguese).
 
S
.
 
All the foregoing will be presented in varying c
ombinations, so that the
 
f
estival goer can savor the s
imilarities and the d
ifferences that make
 
l
ife both wholesome and s
timulating.
 
These point will be further demonstrated by
 
the California f
ilm program to be shown continuously
 
the educational/informational booth where books, records, and
 
a special pamphlet surveying California f
olklife prepared by the California
 
Folklore Society will be available for sale

ach containing an outline map
 
of California on which will be indicated the l
ocation, special contributions

Dear Ethel Dunn:
 
I am sorry to have delayed answering your letter, but I an still settling
 
into this new situation.  As Barbara Rahm perhaps told you, I small be at
 
the Smithsonian for a year, acting as deputy program director of the much
 
enlarged American Folk Life Festival planned for 1976.
 Should you need to
 
reach me here, my telephone number is (
202) 381-3496, and the address is
 
in care of the Division of Performing Arts, Smithsonian Institution,
 
2100 L'Enfant Plaza, Washington, D.C.
 20568.
 
As to the Molokans, they did indeed come to the Festival this summer, some
 
twenty strong, and, I think, in spite of a few misunderstandings and mix-
ups, they went home feeling successful and brave.  They sang twice a day
 
on a small stage set up under the trees by the reflecting pool, a little
 
off the main stream of foot traffic.  Their programs ran around 40 minutes
 
to an hour each.
 Initially, they had planned not to reapet any songs
 
except for the Twenty-Third Psalm with which they ended every program, but
 
this broke down under audience requests, and they repeated several songs
 
many times.  Jack Pavloff introduced each song and talked to the many
 
people who came up after each program to express their interest.  Meanwhile
 
Annie and Paul Zolnikoff demonstrated tea making in the samovar in a small
 
tent near the craft area, and they also served tea to the California par-
ticipants, many of whom began dropping by the Molokan tent for a breather
 
in between their own activities.  The spectators seemed to enjoy all this
 
and Annie and Paul were kept busy chatting with the crowds.
 
Considering the situation into which they were puinged, I thought all the
 
molokans did magnificently in terms of tolerant social interactions.
 In
 
the first place, they were members of a very diffuse California contingent
 
of 120 people of all shapes and sizes:  black$# Chicanos, farm workers,
 
Portuguese Catholic dairy farmers, Chinese, southern white fiddlers, Philip-
pino cooks, etc.  The Molokans seemed to get on well with them all and even
 
stayed late one afternoon to watch a religious procession the Portuguese
 
put on in which we paraded a small herd of dairy cows, all blanketed with
 
paper flowers, down the length of the reflecting pool to return to the barn
 
for a ceremonial milking and a ritual feast of milk and sweet bread.  The
 
Molokans waited for us (
I had been asked to participate in the procession
 
as a "dignitary")  and clapped as we went by, all complete with a robed priest
 
with whom I was walking, a banner of the Holy Virgin and the Portuguese and
 
American flags.
 
Their only objection, for which I unfortunately was not present, was regis-
tered when one of our Chicano farm workers got carried away and made a leg§thy
 
political speech with lots of "Huelgasl" and "Viva la Causasl"  Apparently
 
the molokans, who were scheduled to sing next, refused temporarily to go on
 
d
..
 
after Mr. Figueroa's remarks; fortunately, Barbara Rahm was there and
 
managed to smooth things over.  We spoke later with Mr. Figueroa, who
 
apologized handsomely, but we made it clear to both the Molokans and the
 
farm workers that each participating group had the right to sing their
 
own songs and explain their own history, and eventually I think everybody
 
understood our position.
 
At any rate, the California participants had all come together on the same
 
plane so they had had at least a little chance to get acquainted.  However,
 
the dormitories we lived in during the Festival were also full of a large
 
number of other groups: the Iroquois nation, a delegation from Ghana, another
 
from Jamaica, as well as Italy, Japan and Mexico.  Most of the partipApkats
 
being musicians, they had a strong tendency to play and sing without any let
 
up whatever, sometimes all night long.  The tolokans endured this without
 
complaint, though I must say that that Indian drum really got to me around
 
three o'clock or so every morning.  However, the social atmosphere was
 
warm and friendly, and though the Molokans tended to eat at the same table
 
in the cafeteria, they often chatted with participants from other countries
 
and once even sang in the cafeteria at the request of one of the Mexicans
 
who had not had a chance to hear them.
 
on the fourth day of the festival, one of the Molokansdlders came to see how
 
they were doing; he seemed happy and by then, I thin, they were feeling
 
most successful and everyone was all smiles.  They were indeed received
 
extremely well by the Festival goers; I deliberately did not schedule them
 
onto one of the big stages but still they drew a crowd of a couple of hundred
 
at every session.  Many were Russian speakers and there were animated con-
versations after every session.  My brother, Alan, also had several lengthy
 
conversations with the entire group and signed every program, beseeching
 
them to keep their music pure and unaltered by assimilation; I think they
 
were impressed.  The morning they left, Annie Zolnikoff told my sister that.
 
they had decided that God had led them to come, for they had reached many
 
of their brethren with whom they had lost contact.  I don't think we could
 
have hoped for more.
 
As to the recordings of their concerts, the Smithsonian requires that all
 
stage performances be taped for a perminanet record to be kept in the Smith=
 
sonian Archives  (
non-existent as yet, but they are filed in this office).
 
Within this context, each participant is required to sign a release giving
 
the Smithsonian the right to use the material for scholarly study or for
 
non-profit educational purposes.  Frankly, I expected the Molokans to jib
 
at this, but they signed, and I gather they are putting their trust in the
 
Smithsonian, something of a frail vessel, I
'm very much afraid.  Anyway,
 
they refused to sign any other form of release including one for National
 
Public Radio which puts out non=profit educational programs, and I decided
 
not to press them, on the grounds that they had already extended themselves
 
considerably.
 
In any event, the proqram tapes are here though so far uncatalogued and
 
thus a bit difficult to lay hands on.  My general feeling is that I should
 
like myself to keep track, at least for this year, of who uses the material
 
and for what purposes.  Poor Willard Moore seems to be in bad  graces
 with
 
the Molokans, and I don't knoq quite what to do about that; however, I am
 
sure they would be pleased to have you given access to the tapes as soon as
 
they are in any kind of shape.  We made a special tape of the Molokans in the
 
quiet of a recording studio which we will be sending them to distribute
 
to their shut-ins, but that project is still not completed.  Perhaps they
 
would not mind if you received a copy of that as well.
 
To end off this intilerably lengthy letter, the only suggestion that I have
 
for funding your work is that you might write Alan Jabbour, Special Consiltant
 
banEolk Arts at the National Endowment for the Arts.  I will continue to
 
enquire at the Smithsonian but so far have not turned up any program into
 
which your work would fit.  Anyway, Alan Jabbour is a fine young man of
 
imagination and energy and well used to neg "iating the shoals of the
 
granting agencies.  However, he is limited by the Endowment's own peculiar
 
strictures; as I understand it, he can help you in terms of oral history
 
projects and particularly projects involving "feed-back" and re-infusion of
 
artistic materials into the community.  He cannot do anything about "pure"
 
research. That lies within the domain of the National Endowment for
 
the Humanities, from which few applications in social science seem ever to
 
return.  I would suggest you write Alan an informal letter outlining a
 
couple of your various projects and ask him which he thinks might be fundable
 
through his resources.  By all means, mention my name if you'd like to.
 
(
I think Alan might have heard the Molokans in Washington; at least he
 
attended the Festival duringgtheir period of the mall.)  And don't hesitate
 
to call on me if I can be of agy further help or if there is any other
 
infomration you want.
 I feel we all owe you a great debt for paving the
 
way so that so many Americans could hear the magnificint so ngs of the
 
Molokans.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
P.S.  My brother Alan just called me and I mentioned your funding problem.
 
He thinks the NEH would be interested in fd Minq you if you didn't hit
 
the anthropological side of your work too hard but stressed the historical
 
aspects.  He says NEH is extremely interested in historical research at this
 
particular moment, and thinks you'd have an excellent chance.  Just write
 
a general letteredescribing the nature of your projects and see what happens.
 
Maybe between this and the NEA idea, something will come t hough.  I surely
 
hope so.

Dear Bess:
 
Thanks for your l
etter of June 1
5.  I called your house in Santa
 
Monica and got Barbara Rahm.  I wondered why she hadn't written me and i
t
 
turned out she had the wrong address.  I hope that much i
s straightened out,
 
because I want very much to have further details of the Molokan performance
 
in Washington.  She told me that there are plans to put some performances
 
on t
ape, and if this i
s done with the Molokans I hope we can have access to
 
i
t.  Barbara Rahm said that Jack Pavloff was going to introduce the songs,
 
and his commentary would be o
f special interest to us.  I hope you and
 
Barbara can keep us informed, because our colleague Bill Moore was told
 
that not everybody in the community was in favor of Molokan participation.
 
Moore would l
ike to analyze the songs by t
aking a l
ist to the various churches
 
and discovering which are used how often, and what the imagery means.  Un-
fortunately, Annie Zolnf
!koff discouraged him, citing dissension in the
 
community as a r
esult of his folklore monograph.  I would be sorry to see
 
the project dropped, but he wanted a doctoral dissertation, and his advisors
 
"don't want him just to add another chapter to his M.A. thesis."
 
I
'm telling you this in order to solicit your official reaction.  For
 
some t
ime I
've been interested in the Canadian Dukhobors.  The Dukhobor leader
 
just before Peter Veregin was a woman, Lukeria Kalmykova, who combined beauty,
 
intelligence and spirituality.  Legends about her are still current in the
 
Canadian environment, and no one has thought to collect them.  I f
ailed
 
to turn up any obvious source, such as women's history research, and the
 
Station has no money for even the summer f
ield trip I contemplate.
 
Then, as an additional frustration, I received the enclosed letter from
 
a friend, to whom I spoke about possible placement for one of the Soviet emigres,
 
but I direct your attention to the f
inal two paragraphs (marked).  We could
 
do such a study, with one or several emigres--but again no money.  Do you
 
think the Smithsonian could help us?
 
I l
ook forward to hearing from you when you have the t
ime.
 
Yours,

.C.
 
wear Bess,
 
I certainly hope ,
you have had time to get away from it
 
all for a while and recharge you batteries.
 Many of us were
 
rather concerned about you when the heat,  hurry, and hassles
 
were all at their peaks during the Festival.
 Knowing how
 
busy your schedule usually is,  however,  I don't imagine you
 
get as much rest and recuperation as you deserve.
 
Now that the smoke has cleared,  I thought that I would drop
 
you a note with a few observations made during and after the
 
Festival, along with my feelings in looking back on the
 
whole thing.
 First of all,  I must say that I have never
 
been involved with any event which I felt was as successful
 
as the California presentation,  successfulnot only from the
 
sta
.nr'point of being interesting, appealing and informative
 
for the au-'iences, but also in accomplishing the previously
 
mentioned goal of reinforcing the self-confidence, pride,
 
and enthusiasm in the folk artists themselves toward their
 
particular skills.
 Jon Jesus went will and is still talking
 
about the Festival to everyone.
 Victor (or perhaps I should
 
say Victor and Alicia, who have become quite close since
 
then) an ,
4 Alicia were sorry it all had to come to an end
 
and along with Mrs. Gonzalez, Rebecca and the muralists
 
seem to be quite interested in keeping the momentum going
 
an, in planning some kind of event.
 Rebecca told me that the
 
Figueroa's stopped by the gallery and seemed to be doing
 
rather well.
 
By way of Alicia  I heard that Paul and Juanita Saludado
 
were very happy about their week in Washington.
 You may
 
have heard that Alicia is trying to get Juanita some kind of
 
scholarship to go to school in Los Angeles.
 I also heard
 
that they came down to Los Angeldslast week to perform with
 
the Mexican delegation which was passing through town for a
 
few lays.
 I flew back with Tom Cruz and Rigoberto Rincon
 
who said they wanted to give me a year's pass to the charreadas
 
an' were overflowing with plans and possibilities for a
 
presentation next year, with horses, of course.
 They wanted
 
to have a roaeo-type structure with stands for the spectators
 
built, with a portable stage so that it couli be use for
 
music any dance presentations as well.
 It soun'ed like a
 
great ilea to me.
 I plan to go by and see them sometime in
 
the next few weeks.
 
My family and I took a trip up to San Francisco after I returned
 
and on the way we stopped by the Assyrians ' place in Modesto.
 
I think they were really happy about most of their experiences,
 
although at times Hubert tends to be a faultfin ^
'er and there
 
seem to be a few factional differences between Hubert and
 
Bob.
 They too, however , had already made some plans for a
 
future trip and with a few extra dancers would be enthusiastic
 
(in their own way) about a repeat performance.
 
I talked to Fermin over the telephone and he seemed to be in
 
quite goof spirits about the cracking instruments affair.
 
He said he will submit estimates of repair costs as soon
 
as he comes to Los Angeles to see the instrument maker.
 I
 
hear that Chavela had a very nice wedding .  Our mariachi sent
 
them a gift.
 
Finally , I ran into "Capiro de Jalisco " a couple of weeks
 
ago at 2 a
.m. at the taco stand where his girlfriend works.
 
He proudly reminisced about the Washington trip with some
 
friends anI then announced that he was now the leader of
 
a group playing nightly at a club on Third Street.
 
My overall impression is that the sum total of the feelings
 
towarl.
 the Festival is extremely positive among the people I
 
have had contact with.
 I can 't imagine being more successful
 
in having so many people so satisfied and with so few complaints
 
than was the case with this year 's group.
 
The complaints that I did pick up were few .  Among the more
 
serious were the following three;
 
1)
 A common source of discontent was the condition of
 
the living conditions at Marymount , although the
 
complainers appeared to be a minority.
 
2)
 Lack of care for the participants on their return
 
home from Washington was an unfortunate matter.
 The Cunninghaats
 
in particular were quite upset when they were not allowed to
 
take their instruments on the plane without half-seat tickets.
 
The problem was compounded by the fact that there was no
 
Smithsonian official at the airport to help them straighten
 
it all out .  Perhaps a return charter flight , if possible,
 
would avoir?
 many possibilities of such problems.
 
3)
 The policy on cracking instruments might be made
 
especially clear in advance,  so as to avoid any
 
in ,�
efinite situations or har t feelings among
 
participants or coordinators.
 
A fourth complaint was that the pargos did not pick up the
 
Assyrians as often as they picked up the jarochos.
 This and
 
most of the other not-so -crucial complaints came from a
 
very small number of people , as you probably know.
 
I
  
I think the greatest counter to the more unsolvable problems
 
was the sympathy, concern and TLC which I observed on the
 
part of the coordinators and
, fieldworkers.
 I thought they
 
were generally quite successful in overcoming any feelings of
 
disappointment and i
nept the morale at a high Level and
 
attitgdes on the positive side.
 
As for next year,  I can see an endless number of possibilities
 
for the Festival.
 Latin America, for example,  has so much
 
to offer that the difficulty would come' A0,lection of traditions
 
to be represented and, of course, the organization of
 
invitations of specific groups, travel arrangements, and
 
so forth.
 As far as my participation is concernel, .
you -can
 
count on me to help out in any way I might be able to.
 
After witnessing our part of this year's Festival, I am
 
completely sold on the value, spirit, and general idea of the
 
Festival and am happy to have been a part of such a
 
beautiful happening.
 
Concerning ,
your courses at Northridge,  Barbara told me
 
that she would prefer not to teach in the fall and asked me
 
if I would fill in for the introduction to folklore and
.
 
North American music courses.
 Ordinarily I would delighted
 
to, but I have already spread myself so thin for the Fall
 
Semester (I will be teaching at Loyola and UCLA, as well as
 
putting in a good 20 hours a week playing mariachi music)
 
that I just feel thaticould not put in enough time to do
 
the courses justice.
 As it is now,  I
'm having a picture
 
male of myself to put in my living room so that my family
 
can remember what I look like.
 I really do appreciate the
 
offer, though.
 I gave Barbara the names of a couple of
 
people who might fit the bill.
 
Well,  I hope that all is well with .
you ani that you have
 
more-or-Less settled in Washington with a minimum of hassles.
 
Best of luck in the upcoming year with the Smithsonian;  I
'll
 
be thinking about ,
you.
 
_ Yours sineprely

Dear Fess,
 
Towards the end of my job with the '
75 Festival
., you asked if
 
I might one day write you a small opinion pertaining to the strengths
 
and weaknesses of the event as I saw them in my capacity as grounds
 
crew worker.
 I have never f
.orgot your request, but t
ime and cir-
cumstances of the lust two and a half months have prevented my cor-
respondence . With my recent stint as field researcher in Iowa, I
 
can now view the reality of the festival from another angle.
 It
 
would be difficult to run the entire gamut of my reactions, so I
 
wilt say a few things only about those areas I think might be
 
greatt
.y enriched by better planning on the part of the staff.
 It
 
is easier and more helpful to criticize , anyway,at this time.
 
Overall , the California presentation was much more informative
 
and enlightening, I feel, from the spectators point of v
iew.
 Two
 
main observations are my rationale.
 For one, it is apparent that
 
the field researchers OR the Smithsonian staff shirked their
 
responsibilities towards agriculture and farm
, folklore of The
 
(
treat Plains Region.
 A few paltry crops and two brand new tractors
 
that stood like museum pieces were almost a waste of space and
 
money.
 The tractor pulls, rather the manner in which they were
 
conducted ,
 might as well never had taken place.
 I think that Farl
 
Sampson d
id his research well, but failed somewhere in communication
 
with the FAF because many of his ideas never came off.
 If a family
 
comes to lasso calves , brand calves, or even slaughter calves, then
 
they should have the opportunity.
 If the Smithsonian knows they
 
won't allow these events, why bring the participants?  Sure, they
 
branded the walls of the barn once in a while, still the display
 
was very below what a larger scope would have meant to the audiences.
 
With the crops appearing lonesome and 1075 machinery undemonstrated
 
or talked about, very few people gained any understanding of the
 
continuum of farm l
ife on the midwest plains from early pioneer
 
days ; nor did anyone or anything seek to communicate the traditions
 
of rural life.
 The sheep shearing was fine and worthwhile, the music
 
was o
.k.  (
though always distant=except the Indians).
 But why no
 
farm crafts like rope -making , spinning , sod and wood construction,
 
farming, etc.
 Certainly there is room and participants avaiiable.
 
The second major fault ,
 and one which was somewhat remedied by
 
California ,
 was the entire communication aspect of the FAF.
 I was
 
shocked to find thousands of booklets of recepies of the region, none
 
of which were given out because they lay hiden until the week was
 
past.  Why wasn't there an extensive bibliography and record collection
 
available in the selling stall for this region 9 The stall might as
 
well have been a small log cabin . Workshop stages for musicians
 
would have brought them closer to the audience making instrument
 
demonstrations and songs, stories , etc,  given on a more informal
 
and meaningful plane.
 More informative signs at the craft displays
 
would have hel
-Fed some of the shy participants and spectators.
 
e
 
I think also that the entire ;ublicity of what exactly a
 
visotor to the FAF can f
ind each wFek in Regional America should
 
be beefed up.
 For instance.
, in the program there was only a mass
 
listing of the range, hidden in an inconspicuous l
isting.
 I f
eel
.
 
that if visitors would realize the extent of the crafts, for instance,
 
they would seek out specific interesting items instead of f
lowing
 
along with the crowds.
 Usually they are at the mercy of seeing only
 
what they run into.
 The schedule of musical events serves that area
 
well, the same idea could be carried over to c
rafts, agriculture, etc.
 
It would also benefit the area to incorperate into the schedule
 
more events like the Portuguese milking parade.
 These type of
 
f
estivals have a real place in each region of the country  
,depending
 
of course on the nature of the l
ifestyles and ethnogenic background
 
of the peoples of the region.
 But those evnts where the majority
 
of an area participate, and where each lends their own particular
 
f
unctid
)n, these '
mini'festivals tend to communicate the relationships
 
of f
olk as they work and play together.  To a viewer they don't
 
seem so sterile and '
museum-like' as seperate demonstrations.
 
The California presentation was the best I
've ever seen in
 
Regional America, no kidding.  Much more crowd Fgti
.cipations, more
 
varied presentations, a semi working book and record stall, better
 
research-presentation communication- these are some of my reasons.
 
I was sorry to see the Charros not able to demonstrate in the ring,
 
on the other hand the music styles and performers were a beautiful
 
blending of the traditions of the state, a s
tate which is a curious
 
blend of traditions itself.
 
Well Bess, pardon my typing errors and f
leeting of thoughts. You
 
see, in f
ive hours I l
eave for a six-month stay in Ireland and I
'm
 
beginning to feel quite nervous about it.
 Traditional. Irish music
 
and the Gaelic language are my primarj reasons for going.
 I hope
 
to spend most of my t
ime in the Galway area, but who knows what will
 
happen?  Maybe a roving street musician.
 So, I
'll drop you a line
 
from over there and tell you of magical adventures and other ideas of
 
FAF as they happen, which I
'm sure of.
 
One other think I must ask of you.
 Could you please remind
 
Charely Camp that he must get in contact with each of the persons
 
in Iowa I talked to.
 I promised them all the Smithsonian would
 
provide an adress for questions, cancellations, etc. and also be
 
assured that I had told the FAF about each.  I
'm sorry I
'm not there
 
to do this myself, I thought the rroceedure was aut6matic, and
 
I
'm upset that Regional has done this.
 It i
s inconsiderate to me and
 
the Iowans I contacted.  Thank you f
or your help.
 
Take care of yourself Bess, I know you must be working hard
 
on i°76, and I
'm happy that I will be baclr working for Fresentations
 
that you've had a hand in.  Hopefully B
.C. May and Regional will
 
hire me as ground's crew chief for Regional next summer.
 So, till
 
I see you...

Dear Tom:
 
EAST LANSING •
 MICHIGAN •
 48824
 
November 11,  1975
 
Thank you f
or remembering me and for your kind letter.  Due, no doubt, to miskept
 
Y.R. Chorus f
iles, I received it only today.  Certainly, Molokan music is a worthy
 
and timely (
before they are gone) source for at least a descriptive s
cholarly
 
treatment.  I am too isolated, here, to name a proper candidate off hand.  Besides
 
historical and sociological problems, which the Dunns may help to solve, the
 
linguistic and hagiological prerequisite seems too complex for "mere" musicologists,
 
whom I run into these days.  I will look around, though.  Did you know, at Yale,
 
Professor Mishko Velemirovic, who i
s now heading the Department of Musicology at
 
Wisconsin, I think.  He did a lot of serious work on various portions of Slavic
 
music, notably, on old Russian hymnology, the kriuki notation, etc.; and he was
 
in close touch with A. Gardner's institute in Munich that does most of the work
 
in these f
ields.  Velemirovic would certainly be qualified to supervise such a
 
project, and he i
s l
ikely to know of relevant doctoral candidates.  Unless you
 
have already been in touch with him, I will be happy to f
orward your package to
 
him and ask him to contact you if he is interested in pursuing the matter.
 
Also, as chairmen and candidates whom I may contact are certain to ask, do you
 
know if there are any grants potentially available f
or researchers in this field?
 
Perhaps, through the Highgate Road Institution or yours, or some other Foundation.
 
Knowledge about potential support would greatly help in drafting the more able
 
f
orces.  I doubt that, at present, many state or private universities would
 
release funds f
or such an undertaking; they usually restrict themselves to
 
offering teaching assistantships for, at least logistically, less ambitious PhD
 
productions.
 
Do you and Brock feel that the Yale Russian Chorus could and should help expose
 
some of that music? (
I have also a mixed chorus here). With the aid of an
 
original tape, I would be delighted to arrange or edit or transcribe whatever is
 
necessary for that purpose.  Or perhaps Brock or yourself would l
ike to try your
 
h

Dear Bess:
 
This letter will hopefully clear up the budget
 
mystery.
 I didn't intend to keep you in the dark but I
 
should have realized that,  in order for you to make plans,
 
you would need to have an exact idea of the budget.
 So
 
my apologies for my denseness.
 The original budget for
 
fieldwork that I drew up oontained $10,405 for the Coastal
 
California research program.
 However, because your con-
tract was changed more money was available for fieldwork.
 
This increase of $2,920 gave a total of $13,325 available
 
for California fieldwork.
 To date the following contract
 
proposals have been drawn up:
 Elaine Miller $406, Greg
 
Longenecker $500, Margaret Bach $1504, and Justin Bishop
 
$780.
 This is a total of $3190.
 In addition to these
 
fieldworkers I have heard from Shirley Sun but not 4rom
 
her assistant Vivian Chiang.
 Therefore I can no lany
 
specific figures yet for them.
 I will let you know as
 
soon as  I am able to get in touch with Ms. Chiang.
 
To date several of the fieldworkers you mentioned
 
have not contacted me.
 Please emphasize that it is im-
perative they do so.
 The reason it is imperative is that
 
they cannot be paid retroactively.
 In other words,  if the
 
paper process hasn't started rolling by the time they hand
 
in their final report they will not be paid. 
I hope�uch
 
a situation will not occur for at least two reasons.
 First
 
is that inevitably the fieldworkers will be mad at me or,
 
at least,  think it is my fault.
 But more importantly I
 
would hate to see someone put in his time and effort under
 
the belief he would be paid and then have to be disappointed.
 
I hope this has clarified things a little but please
 
let me know if there are still some fuzzy edges.
 
Best Wishes,
 
Bill McNeil
 
Happy Graduation!
