It's a great pleasure for me to speak to the members of NASAA.
 Though I have been
 
at the Endowment much much longer than I should have -
-
 almost twelve years - -  and
 
though the Folk Arts Program has been in official existence almost eleven years, and
 
though we've made many presentations before the National Council on the Arts, we've
 
never before addressed NASAA itself (even in part) and it is surely high time that
 
we remedied that situation.
 I should like to introduce my co-workers and long-time
 
companions in the folk arts - -  Dan Sheehy and Barry Bergey.  Dan is assistant director
 
of the program; Barry is senior folklorist.  We have decided to address you in turn,
 
and I get to go first.
 
I have decided myself to take up the itchy question of definitions in this far-
reaching and generous area of concerns that essentially address the question of how to
 
spread the action out.  Before I begin, please understand my purpose is repertorial

rather than preseciptive.
 These are the ways in which these terms seem to be used these
 
days, that's all.
 I'm going to assume at the beginning that you have a
 
working feel for the tri-partite division that most people use to divide
 
the arts world:
 classical  (
or elite)  arts;  popular arts;  folk arts.
 The
 
last one always causes difficulty,  though,  so I will begin there.
 And
 
£-
co from h
-ere - o
ix---e t,  I shall talk about folk arts,  community arts,  ethnic
 
arts, minority arts and multi-cultural arts.
 All in ten minutes!
 (I'll
 
talk fast)
 
The first thing I must do is to persuade you to try to think a
 
little differently than you may already about the function of definitions.
 
Most people think of a definition as a way of dividing some things from
 
some other things.
 And they think,  therefore,  about the particular lines
 
that are drawn by the definition and on which side of the lines certain
 
items fall.
 This causes them to focus on the edges for greater clarity
 
of discrimination,  leaving the center of the subject often a bit soft and
 
muzzy.

How about doing it the other way?
 How about thinking of definitions
 
as ways of focussing on the essentials. 
What are the core issues that
 
distinguish particular classes of things from other classes of things?
 
When you do this,  you find that although the edges may be fuzzy and may
 
remain so,  the center issues become clearer and clearer.
 Now doesn't
 
that actually fit reality better?
 Doesn't it also actually fit human
 
needs better?
 Isn't it ultimately perhaps useful to retain some ambiguity
 
around the edges of a problem,  so that some things can fit here
 
could fit there,  but there is,

 This is why,  hz-the-way, when you read Folk Arts'  guidelines
 
and the like,  you will find lots of words like  "generally" and "often"
 
and "in most cases"  and "usually."
 We're not being mealy-mouthed.
 We're
 
trying to direct your attention to the heart of the matter -
-
 the core
 
issue -
-
 and away from the minor exceptions and the little variances.
 
As Ann Landers puts it -
-
 "Don't sweat the small stuff."
 
So,  let us concentrate on the heart of the definitions that we suggest
 
here.
 To me,  the five terms that mentioned at the beginning of this
 
talk fit together in
 elegant three-dimensional over-lapping
 
structure of strategic thinking.
 Though similar,  none of these approaches
 
are the same,  and that is why they are important.
 
Folk Arts.
 There are many perfectly acceptable definitions of this
 
term.
 The definition that we use at the Endowment is the only one I will
 
3
 
discuss here at this time — it is:
 the multiple artistic forms developed
 
over time by groups that distinguish themselves as groups by possessing
 
the same language or ethnicity or occupation or religion or place of
 
residence or other common factor.
 Folk Arts are generally characterized
 
by having been learned informally,  passed on from one group member to
 
another;  they utilize a shared aesthetic style typical of the group,
 
often demonstrating the group's identity:
 e.g.  Hawaiian hula,  Pueblo
 
pottery,  African-American blues.
 
Now,  there are various kinds of people who can legitimately be
 
called folk artists.
 From the point of view of the folk group itself,
 
probably the most culturally valuable are those who have been brought
 
up within the tradition,  learning the arts as they live the life that
 
the art itself stems from and represents.
 Such people are sometimes
 
called "tradition bearers" or "culture bearers."
 They exist in other
 
fields as well.
 I have always thought that Nadia Boulanger must have
 
been a tradition bearer in the field of classical piano.
 
Then there are those folk artists who have been brought up within
 
a tradition and who determine that they will develop it into new ways.
 
They are the innovators,  the "new wavers."
 Sometimes they bring it off
 
and create a refreshing and exciting new artistic style that becomes
 
accepted by the larger group and gets added into the cultural repertoire.
 
More often,  they don't,  and they sink into a noble oblivion, unheard of
 
by future generations.
 Again,  this same situation exists in many other
 
art forms.
 A
1 u  was a—

Luu t such a
 
Finally,  there are practitioners who have not been brought up in
 
4
 
the tradition but who determine,  at some point in their lives,  to
 
learn it.
 This is a natural human impulse -
-
 to admire deeply,  to
 
the point of commitment -
-
 somebody else's art form,  and it should
 
never be denigrated.
 Such practices stretch the aesthetic muscles and
 
increase the humane and tender side of an artist's character.

way it is with the folk arts.

So, when the Folk Arts Program began to think what should we do,  the
 
order of critical necessity was clear.
 First, we must try to help the
 
authentic old-timer tradition-bearers,  partly because nobody else was
 
helping them but mostly because of their essential function within the
 
art form and within the culture.
 Second, we should try -
-
 if there was
 
any extra money -
-
 to help the emerging exploratory art forms that were
 
growing out of traditional cultures.
 Lastly -
-
 if there still was any
 
extra money -
-
 we should try to help the outside learners, many of
 
whom could indeed make serious contributions to the preservation of less
 
supported art forms.
 And that's basically what we've tried to do and
 
if anybody wants to look at our grants by year,  I think you'll see that
 
that's just what we've done.
 
So.
 I hope we've been able to make a reasonable case for Folk Arts'
 
policy and policies.
 Let's move on.
 If all this stuff is  "folk arts"
 
then what are  "ethnic arts?"
 
5
 
The term "ethnic"  tends,  these days,  to refer to people who share
 
not only the same language but the same history and,  at some past time,
 
the same geographical area.
 They have a solidity that only history can
 
bestow.
 They are the kind of people who -
-
 when they move to a different
 
place such as the United States -
-
 get referred to in a hyphenated sort
 
of way -
-
 African-Americans;  Polish-Americans;  Chinese-Americans.
 The
 
important thing to remember about such people is that they were originally
 
un-hyphenated:
 they were Africans,  they were Poles,  they were Chinese.
 
As such,  they had created a number of different kinds of complex art
 
forms:
 classic  (
elite),  popular and -
-
 more than likely -
-
 several forms
 
of traditional  (or folk).
 It is insulting to such people to confine them
 
to only one art form.
 
Should a group of Polish-Americans turn up in my office,  for example,
 
seeking support for a major Polish-American cultural festival,  I would
 
tell them that they should include in their planning all the range of
 
Polish cultural creativity -
-
 they should have Chopin concerts and Paderewsk.
 
concerts and polka band concerts  (preferably with dancing)  and concerts of
 
the mouth music of the Tatra mountains,  along with exhibits of paper cuts
 
as well as painting,  etc.,  etc.
 The Endowment's Folk Arts Program,  then,
 
would confine its assistance to the folk/traditional part,  assuming that
 
help for the other parts of the events could come from other sources.
 
Exactly such a multi-parted cultural presentation occurred recently in
 
Atlanta at the first African American Black Arts Festival;  there was jazz
 
there and Black theater and readings from the works of great Black
 
authors from Langston Hughes to Toni Morrison,  but there was also South
 
Carolina sea grass basketry and rural blues and Black shape note hymn
 
singing.
 And that's the really satisfying way to be ethnic: 
to get it
 
all in.
 
6
 
All right then, where do the so-called "community arts"  fit in?
 
Actually,  the term "community arts" refers to a
 
rather than to

people.
 Skill or training are not the essentials,
 
willingness and enthusiasm are.
 A community theatre tries to find
 
something for every potential participant to do,  if it's ushering or
 
acting or selling tickets.
 A community chorus wants to attract members,
 
so it probably has only a minimal audition policy and a tather relaxed
 
schedule of rehearsals.
 Community art centers are just that -
-
 places
 
where untrained but eager enthusiasts can find some encouragement and
 
a place to try.
 
This is a marvellous idea,  and a region without a community arts
 
program is impoverished indeed;  I myself from time to time have attempted
 
to find a community chorus in Washington where I can simply go every
 
once in a while and join in making a joyful noise.
 I am glad there
 
are professional choruses -
-
 somebody has to keep the standards but,
 
7
 
I
'd just like to go somewhere and sing in a big bunch every now and
 
again.
 Community arts,  then,  don't go in for heavy federal funding
 
requests;  probably they are best off looking for community dollars,  but
 
we would all be the psychically poorer were they not around.
 Finally,
 
bear in mind that a community chorus can sing When the Saints Go Marching
 
In or Yesterday or the Hallelujah Chorus and it probably will;  the
 
community arts,  like ethnic arts,  cut across the divisions of classical,
 
folk,  and popular.
 
Onward.
 How about minority arts? 
The Endowment General Counsel
 
tells me that the term "minority" is such a very sticky wicket,  legally
 
speaking,  that many lawyers in the Justice Department are trying to get
 
it out of all l
-cislation.

Well, we're nearly home.
 Multi-cultural arts"  is a new term that
 
has come into fashion recently,  and so it is awfully hard to define.
 
I suggest watching it carefully.
 The other terms have developed reasonable
 
internal coherency;  they are not interchangeable and each one focusses
 
the conversation on different aspects of the complex world of the arts.
 
Multi-cultural arts as a term is currently being used as a kind of over-
archin g expression to cover all the many attempts that are being made
 
to extend the arts world to encompass non-Anglos,  from importing
 
classical Peking opera companies to running talent searches for potential
 
Maria Tallchiefs on Indian reservations and all points in between.
 
It's a bit hard to grab hold of — but actually,  I welcome the idea.
 
It means,  for one thing,  that we have become sufficiently aware of the
 
richness of human inventions that have reached these fortunate shores
 
in the form of the creative products of our incoming peoples that we
 
need a big phrase to sum it all up.
 It's a kind of  "the sky's the limit"
 
term we occasionally look for to say it all.
 I offer a word of warning
 
though.
 Peek under the curtain every once in a while and see just what
  
is going on that is so multi-cultural anyway.
 
A long time ago when I first came to the Endowment I visited a
 
southern state that shall be nameless and met with the state arts council
 
that shall also be nameless and spoke with a charming elderly lady arts
 
council member whose name I never got to begin with.
 I told her that the
 
Folk Arts Program was looking forward to developing a program in her state
 
in part because of the long history of musical invention of the Afro-
American people of the area -
-
 a creative contribution that had gone
 
round the world and had been taken to the hearts of the world's many
 
peoples.
 "Why honey, we know about all that,"  she said.
 "What we want
 
9
 
you to help us do is to show us how to get those little black children
 
to learn to play the violin;  that's what they have to do if they're going
 
to turn into real artists."
 Okay — there was a multi-cultural situation
 
there all right,  but which way was the action going?
 We have to learn
 
some new rules and we have to gain some new values if we really commit
 
to multi-cultural programming...
 
But let me end on a positive note.
 I have been fortunate enough to
 
spend the better part of my life in a position where I could marvel at
 
the enormous unstoppable commitment to creativity of every kind of human
 
being -
-
 cowboys,  Mennonites,  Lithuanians,  Tlingits,  Newyoricans,  you
 
name it,  they're out there thinking up new ways to express the meaningful-
ness of their particular way of life.
 It is our happy task,  as arts
 
administrators,  to try to keep open the sluice gates to the channels
 
through which this stream of creativity can flow.
 It is indeed a happy
 
task;  it is also a complicated task that will tax our intellectual powers
 
to the utmost.
 Barry and Dan are going to be showing you some of the
 
fascinating complexities that lie in store.
 One thing I can assure you
 
for the next fifty or hundred or hundred-fifty years,  none of us is
 
going to be bored....
