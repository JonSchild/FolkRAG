Levi Miles interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 26, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company Plant 
in Evansville, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity. 
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: 
Today's Wednesday, May 26, 2021. This is an interview for the occupational 
history archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress funded by the 
Archie Greene Fellowship. As part of this project, I am interviewing cement workers in the 
Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry in the United 
States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the 
Library of Congress. I am Vyta Pivo and today I'm speaking with Levi Miles here at the 
Lehigh Cement Company Plant in Evansville, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm you, give 
me your permission to record this interview, correct?  
 
Levi Miles:  
Yes, ma'am.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much. Uh, could you tell me your full name, year birth. and where you 
were born?  
 
LM:  Levi Kevin Miles, was born 1991 in San Diego, California.  
 
VP: 
And is that where you grew up?  
 
LM: 
 No, my father was in the Navy, so I was born while he was in Japan or something. 
So, I was born in a naval hospital there. I grew up in Missouri.  
 
VP: 
How did you first learn about cement?  
 
[00:01:10] 
 
LM: 
I worked, I traveled for the last four and a half, five years, working at different cement 
plants through a company out of Kansas. And then, I mean, it's one of those plants, one of the 
things that any time they have an opening, anywhere you're at, apply for it because it's a great 
job, a job you could just move your family or myself, it was. And because the pay's good, 
insurance is good. And that's how I got here. They were they were hiring. I actually, I met my 
wife while I was working here and when we got married, that was … now here I am, two and 
a half years later.  
 
VP: 
So, how did you first get your first job?  
 
LM: 
Uh, first job here? 
 
VP: 
Working with cement and traveling.  
 
LM: 
Let's see, it was probably five, you know, seven years ago now. And we went to 
Chattanooga, Tennessee, to a Buzzi plant. And then after that, it was just all two weeks here 
and then off to a different one, couple that we've been to, a couple other Lehigh plants in 
Nebraska, and it's kind of been all over the place.  
2 
 
 
VP: 
How did you first learn about this job opportunity?  
 
[00:02:25] 
 
LM: 
I had my friend right out of high school started doing it, and then I started doing a 
couple of years after him. We've had friends that were in the cement industry already, like I 
am now actually with a plant. Just never thought it was, I didn't know how good of a job it 
could have, it could be. So, it was until I was here and I had a job opportunity.  
 
VP: 
So, what did you do for work when you were traveling initially when you started?  
 
LM: 
We did silo repair, any of the storage silos that the cement that's made is stored in, 
because a lot of plants are old. I mean, you look at this plant, it's over a hundred years old and 
in some parts of it. It's a lot of outside silo repair or we'd go inside the silo and pretty much 
pour a whole new inside wall all the way up the inside of the silo just to support it, stabilize 
it, because it's 100 year old concrete. That's pretty much all we did for the four and a half 
years, five years.  
 
VP: 
So, you worked with concrete basically? 
 
LM: 
Yes, worked with concrete to repair concrete.  
 
VP: 
What's involved in doing that labor?  
 
LM: 
Heights, heights, I mean, tight spaces. Truly, everything runs through, it's pumped 
through a hose that runs, you have a four inch pipe that runs up the silo and then everything's 
pumped into the wall. And it's just you pour like four feet and then you let it sit, crank 
yourself up, pour another four feet. It's just, it's a long process and it's tedious, I guess you 
could say. 
 
VP: 
Did you have to put in the formwork yourself? 
 
LM: 
Yeah, all the formwork, everything is, and then take it off and lift it up and set it on, 
and then raise your. You have a platform that's run off, which is pretty much hand-held 
winches. I mean, you just raise yourself up, however, with these top silos are 120 feet. So 
that's what, four feet at a time.  
 
VP: 
Is it kind of a dangerous job?  
 
LM: 
It is. It's, if it’s not done right. I mean, of course, there's a lot of training, a lot of safety 
you have to have to follow. So, it all depends on the guys, guys you're working with and the 
training that they get and understand. So, it makes it easy when you work with guys that you 
trust.  
 
VP: 
And so, how many people would work at any given time on a project?  
 
[00:05:29] 
 
3 
 
LM: 
The most, I would say around anywhere from six to 10. I mean, we usually had a crew 
of eight, eight guys here pretty much all the time. And of course, you have, you have your 
guys leave, come and go, just like anywhere else, but say eight, six to 10 guys with one 
supervisor all the time.  
 
VP: 
And so. And how long can a project like that take for you?  
 
LM: 
We, all it depends. To do a slip job like that, we were here for a five, five, six months. 
And then there was a few guys that stayed when we went, we were actually went over to 
Nazareth, to the other Lehigh plant and did some work there and then came back here to 
finish up. So, anywhere from it could be four months to eight months, 10 months, just kind of 
depends on how many silos, how big they are. There is a lot to factor in, I guess.  
 
VP: 
So, you spend another six months and then you travel to another place.  
 
LM: 
Yeah, at times. I mean, I've been to a place where it's just two weeks. I mean, it's, you 
never know. I was, I wasn't in a cement plant and at this particular job, but I was out in 
Vancouver, Washington for two and a half years, just and it was a grain facility, but it's still 
owned by a cement plant. It's just different, which varies.  
 
VP: 
What did you like about the work?  
 
[00:06:41] 
 
LM: 
I like traveling. It really is. And just seeing somewhere other than where I grew up, 
that's all I ever. I mean, that's the main part. I mean, pay was all right, but traveling was nice 
there for a while.  
 
VP: 
Did you travel with the same people?  
 
LM: 
Oh yeah. I traveled with three guys that I graduated high school with. We traveled all 
the time, so that made it made it a lot easier to go from plant to plant.  
 
VP: 
And did the company provide you housing or did you have to … 
 
LM: 
They gave us per diem, they paid us per diem. So, we use that. You got, you had to 
pick your hotel, of course. And depending on the place, the hotels were usually cheap, not the 
greatest, but the key was to make as much money as you could. So, try to spend as little as 
possible.  
 
VP: 
Did you have time off?  
 
LM: 
We had some days off, we usually had Sundays off. Going home, you had your 
chances to go home for vacation. That wasn't really if you needed to go in for something, 
they'd let you go home. But it's not like, you didn't get, like, paid vacation like other places. 
They didn't they didn't like for you to go home. I guess it was, uh, work, work, work.  
 
VP: 
And so how did you end up in the Lehigh Valley?  
 
[00:08:11] 
4 
 
 
LM: 
Um, there was a crew out here that we came from Kansas and they put us with this 
crew. And so, we were working here, staying at a hotel. And I heard guys in the elevator one 
day saying that how they were hiring. This was after I was dating this girl for a couple of 
months. And so, I applied and didn't hear anything back. The job had gotten over and I went 
to Nazareth and that job got over. They said they were going to send us to Oklahoma City. 
Like, I just decided I was going to quit and use all my savings to move up here. And then like 
a month later, they called me and offered me a job. And that's how, I forgot I even applied 
here.  
 
VP: 
So, what was the first job you got here?  
 
LM: 
I was a laborer for maybe two weeks, and then I went right into the mills is the, I’m 
the fill-in. So, I'm a laborer Monday through Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. And 
then on Thursdays I fill in because there's no one scheduled for day shift on Thursday. It's 
called the twenty-first shift. And then for any vacations I fill in for any guys that go on 
vacations in that department.  
 
VP: 
So, how long have you been doing this for?  
 
LM: 
Almost two years. Two years, June 18th, actually.  
 
VP: 
So, what does your typical schedule look like?  
 
[00:09:46] 
 
LM: 
Monday through Friday, seven to three is my typical schedule. I only have, there’s a 
lot of young guys that that work with me right now. So, they only have two weeks vacation. 
And there's one older gentleman, he has, he's got four weeks. He's maxed out at four weeks. 
So, I only have 12 weeks of vacation to fill in for, so most of the time, I’m day shift Saturday, 
Sunday off, which is nice, sometimes. I actually enjoy swing shift, I would like to get on a 
swing shift position.  
 
VP: 
Oh, what do you like it?  
 
LM: 
More money to be made, obviously. And having certain different days off during the 
week, like one week you'll have Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday off, which is nice to 
have. And instead of just Saturday, Sunday, when it's hard to get a lot of stuff done or rushing 
around after work, when you get off at 3:00 every day and the next day you'll have Thursday, 
Friday off, you start Saturday. So, it just changes it up a little bit. And it's quiet here at night 
when no one's here, it’s kind of, actually kind of peaceful sometimes.  
 
VP: 
So, what do you do now at the mill? 
 
LM: 
Make the cement. I mean, anything that comes out of the kiln that gets sold that and 
what we do, make sure everything stays running and stay making money.  
 
VP: 
So, what specific tasks do you have?  
 
5 
 
LM: 
Let's see, I mean, everything is run off of air slides, elevators, this is not, I mean, our 
main task, I guess, is to, it’s just to keep up with everything, anything, any moving piece of 
equipment, anything that is just to make sure everything stays in tip top shape, where we 
don't shut, we shut down as little as possible.  
 
VP: 
So, do you do a lot of maintenance?  
 
LM: 
Um, no, technically no. We have the whole, we’re not allowed to, not to say we're not 
allowed to, but we have a whole maintenance crew for that. We just, if we see something that 
needs fixed, we write it up, give it to our boss for maintenance, [unclear]. And it's just kind of 
the chain of command, then they give it to and just gets passed on. We very little things we 
fix, there’s just more things to that and it's doable.  
 
VP: 
But so, do you use the material, basically?  
 
LM: 
Yeah. So, we everything all the materials moved through, through air slides, through 
pipes that runs over to the storage silos where it's stored and loaded into trucks. I mean, we 
don't physically touch it, but make sure that everything is kept up with and cleaned up and 
nothing goes wrong.  
 
VP: 
So, what are some of the tools or technologies that you rely on to do this work?  
 
LM: 
Not so much tools, technology. I mean, everything is run up through Central. So, I 
mean, we're pretty much at their, at their command. They can see anything that goes wrong if 
something chokes up. I mean, we rely on our air pressure for the most part. We use an airline 
with an air hostess to get something unchoaked or to keep it feeding. And just, so air is our 
friend a lot of time just to keep everything flowing.  
 
VP: 
And so, do you monitor the rate and like how …  
 
[00:13:36] 
 
LM: 
Yeah, we monitor, there's, we have scales and in our little office that the monitors, 
how many tons per hour were of the clinker we're putting in to make cement. So, that and 
then and they also have stuff up in the computers at Central that monitor how much gets 
pushed out and how much finished cement is getting thrown over. I mean, it's all, it's all done 
through a computer, through to a scaling system. I mean, there are scales on rollers 
underneath the belt that that reads how much ton per hour is going, actually going into the 
mill. So, those are things you have to, like that you have to keep those clean or else you're 
going to be way off somewhere.  
 
VP: 
Did you have to get some additional training to do this work?  
 
LM: 
Yeah, I mean, you've got to train through four, three months. I had to train for three 
months. I think, just everything just to know the way the material flows through, through 
everything. Because not everything that comes out of the mill goes straight over to, it's just 
one big circle. It's not fine enough, it will go back into the system and run back through 
everything and then go back through. So, you had to train on a lot, just make sure you know 
everything, how everything works.  
 
6 
 
VP: 
So, previously you worked at plants, but now you're working as part of a plant, where 
there things that surprised you?  
 
[00:15:13] 
 
LM: 
Just the … yeah, I mean, I've seen the mills and the kilns and all of that, just really the 
effort and the process of everything, like actually understanding how everything's done and 
the chemistry and everything involved in it. So that was, that was interesting and new to learn 
because a lot of people think cement and it's nothing, it's just rocks crushed up, add water and 
that's it. And it's definitely not the case. So, that was interesting to see that and understand 
and learn that part of it, how it's actually done.  
 
VP: 
And you're also probably working part of the, as part of the union, right? That must 
have been a different experience.   
 
LM: 
Um, yeah. It's great, really. Um, I'm not going to say, you're protected in a way. Um, I 
mean you, but you can't take that for granted by any means, so and you're only as good as … 
I can't be worse than somebody else, it just doesn't work that way. You’re only as good as 
your brothers in the union. But they do they take care of you, they make sure that you get 
paid, that if something happens and you weren't asked to do something and you should have 
been, I mean they make sure they take care of your insurance. That's the main reason I took 
this job, because they offer us the best insurance I've ever, have ever had been a part of. My 
mom works in a hospital and my insurance is better than her insurance. So, it's just, it's 
outrageous, really, the things that we kind of we work for, but we get to, I mean, and people 
take advantage of it and it just blows my mind sometimes.  
 
VP: 
Was it challenging for you to come in as someone who did not grow up in the Lehigh 
Valley and did not have siblings or parents in the industry? 
 
[00:17:22] 
 
LM: 
I thought it was going to be a little bit more difficult. I mean, getting along and maybe 
getting the guys to trust me, um, was the hardest part, I think, because everyone would talk to 
me. I mean, and I'm not hard to talk to, I'm pretty outgoing, I'm not shy by any means. But 
get them to actually, I don't know, trust me, I guess it's kind of how it felt. I don't know if 
that's how it actually happened, but that's how it felt to me was the hardest part, because I did, 
I came in, a lot of guys that … this is a family plant. I mean, if you ask anyone around here, 
their uncle, their grandfather, great grandfather, father have all worked here. And then you 
got this this kid from Missouri that … so, yeah. So, that was it was interesting. But I mean 
I'm good, I'm friends with everyone here. I've made a lot of good friends. Wouldn't, I want to 
stay here the rest of my life if possible.  
 
VP: 
What did you do to earn their trust?  
 
LM: 
I just work hard. I mean, I work hard, do what I'm told. Yes, that's really it, that's 
really all you have to do here. Come in and you just can't be, can't come in here and just think 
everything's going to be handed to you and not to do anything. People see, they see that guys 
see that.  
 
7 
 
VP: 
So, we've actually become kind of friends with some workers. Do you meet up after 
work to hang out?  
 
LM: 
Oh, on occasion, yeah. I mean, unfortunately, a lot of us are, at least the guys I hang 
out with on shift. So, it's tough to do something when you're all on different shifts. But there 
are occasions, absolutely. Go to someone's house or have a beer here or there, stop and grab a 
bite to eat. I mean, go golf. A lot of us golf. So, I was like, I'll have to work when we're on 
the same shift. But it is tough. 
 
VP: 
Has the pandemic changed the work experience for you? 
 
[00:19:39] 
 
LM: 
Other than having to wear a mask all the time, I mean, it's hot in general, let alone in a 
110 degrees inside the building, plus wearing a mask. So, that makes it rough. Other than 
that, nothing has changed much. I mean, it is what it is. Being laid off, this was the first time 
I've gotten laid off. I was laid off for three months. I was really I was worried for a while, not 
sure because I was pretty low at that point. I only had, like, two guys underneath me at that 
point. So, I was pretty worried about not coming back. That was probably the worst part of 
the pandemic was being laid off for three months.  
 
VP: 
What did you do during that time?  
 
LM: 
Nothing. I didn't work, did housework,..  
 
VP: 
Did housework work on my house?  
 
LM: 
I tried to stay as busy as I could so much. I mean, I do. I drew unemployment. I mean, 
I was about the only the only thing I could do. So, I just tried to stay busy around the house, 
went crazy there for a while.  
 
VP: 
So, how did you feel when they called you back? 
 
LM: 
You’ve mentioned you’ve become friends with some of the cement workers! 
 
LM: 
I was … I was relieved because like I said, this is a work stuff. But this is a job that is 
absolutely can if you lose it, I mean, you get used to making a certain kind of money. And so 
I was worried because there's nowhere else around here that the pays like this. Some places 
are kind of close, but I just didn't want to start all over from square one with someone else 
again. But yeah, I was I was really relieved when I got called back.  
 
VP: 
So, how many folks came back after being away? 
 
LM: 
We got everyone back. Shit I think we have 80, 80 to 90 employees and over half, 
half the guys were laid off. So, it was that was nice that they ended up that they brought 
everyone back because it was there was talk that that wasn't going to happen. They were 
going to downsize and but they didn't work.  
 
VP: 
Did some guys just have to come back?  
 
8 
 
LM: 
No, I think I'm pretty sure I think there was a couple of guys that that might have left 
after they got laid off for the pandemic.., just… I can't remember, but everyone that I can that 
I can recall came back for the same position. Yeah. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, what would you say is the most challenging part of your job right now?  
 
[00:22:21] 
 
LM: 
I mean, it really all depends on the day. I mean, there’s days like today, I had I had an 
awful day today, just nothing like nothing went right. Everything choked up. So, I wouldn't 
say one thing is more challenging than the next, because it's it all pretty much it leads up to 
the same thing. But I mean, any time anything, any type of air slide or anything chokes up is 
a challenge. And it, just it's dirty and there's just no good way to get around it besides to get 
right it right in it and get dirty. And I was black when, I before I came up here, had to take a 
shower in my whole skin face was black. So, I would say, yeah, just not one thing is more 
challenging than the other, just it all runs into to into each other in the heat. I would guess 
you said adds to a big factor.  
 
VP: 
And you don't like getting dirty.  
 
LM: 
I don't mind getting dirty, but that no dirty has no fun. I had it in my eyes and I mean, 
it's not fun. It's hot. It's hot material burns your skin, you know.  
 
VP: 
So, what keeps you going? What makes you excited about the work?  
 
LM: 
I like like to make money. I like the guys I work with. My wife, my wife and I just 
bought a house. So, that's a, that's a sure thing to keep me going. Now, looking, we're trying 
to have a kid. So, there's another thing. But mainly I'm a worker. I, I like to work, I, I can’t 
imagine not doing anything and making money that is offered to you now by not work. And I 
mean that's just how I was, how I was grown up to work. I guess that's what keeps me going. 
Really just it's a great job people that you don't find this job very often so I can't lose it. Can't 
afford to.  
 
VP: 
Do you see yourself working in a different kind of department maybe. Or do you like 
do you want to say no?  
 
LM: 
I would definitely consider, there's a couple of things I would consider working up. 
There's a PCO on a computer or in the lab. Even at some point I would consider being a boss, 
being part of the company side, after I put some time and get more familiar with everything 
just so it'd be easier, but yeah, I wouldn't stay in the mills all the time.  
 
VP: 
Do you feel like the company provides opportunities for you to move through the 
company?  
 
LM: 
Oh yeah. I mean I think it's all how, it's all about your work ethic. I mean, there's 
definitely there's definitely chances and opportunities if a Unit 8 positions opens up and it's 
available and they offer it, I think there's definitely chances to move up somewhere. And I 
mean, it'd take a while, but it's there.  
 
9 
 
VP: 
So, in closing out this interview, is there a question that maybe you haven't asked or 
something you'd like to comment on before we wrap up?  
 
LM: 
I don't think so. I think, everything I mean, it was covered pretty well. It's just. I'm just 
I'm just. This is interesting doing this, I would like two hear be able to hear this later on. I 
mean, years down the road, just to hear what everyone said, it's just I don't even know this 
was a thing until she talked to us about it.  
 
VP: 
That's awesome. Well, you'll have an opportunity to do that. Thank you so much for 
your time.
