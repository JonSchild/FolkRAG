Interviewee in English: 
When I was a little girl, I would always watch my parents and 
other people weave. While they were weaving, I would sit 
close to them, watching and observing how they wove. I really 
loved to learn how to weave, so I would always watch them 
when they wove. When they realized that I really liked to 
weave, they made me a small loom so that I could start 
learning to weave. So, I started weaving when they made my 
loom.  When they watched me weave, I already knew how to 
do it because I had been watching them for a long time. I 
started learning with a simple lavalava, which was just plain, 
no designs or any supplement weft.  When they knew that I 
was able to weave the plain ones, then they started teaching 
me to make the ones that we wear, and ones with 
supplemental weft. 
 
01:43 Question 2 
2.   In your mind, who is the one person you most associate with weaving in your life and 
why? 
A. Ulithian:  Lol yam luluwal, itei semal le ye kael yam fel ngali irel yam fefaru doh deur hare 
yam deduer doh?  Bo mada fal? 
Interviewee in Ulithian: 
02:04 Yeramtala ye kael yai fel ngali yal… yamem deur le

yiy bala sor chog hare yor mele ye machei hare, ibe luwliy hare 
mada, ngo igula. 
 
Interviewee in English: 
The one person that I associate with weaving is the person 
that taught me how to weave. Because I was used to the way 
she wove and how she taught me, I would quickly pick up 
anything she taught me about how to make the warp and how 
to weave. She was also the one who taught me names of 
different supplemental warp and supplemental weft designs. 
 
02:53 Question 3 
3.   Why is weaving so important to you? 
A.   Ulithian: Mada mele dedeur ye kael yal palengpelal ngalug iyang? 
Interviewee in Ulithian: 
03:10 Ye paling pelal bo cholop mekala sima taptap iyang.

Interviewee in English: 
Weaving is important because there is a lot of meaning 
attached to lavalava.  First, lavalava is our clothing on our 
islands (the Outer Islands of Yap State). We use lavalava for 
funerals, apologizing, and other things. And, it’s one thing that 
identifies us Outer Islanders, and sets us apart from the 
Yapese and other people, like other Micronesians. When 
people see us wearing lavalava, right away, they know we are 
Outer Islanders, not Yapese. 
 
04:19  Question 4 
4.   How has weaving or woven skirts changed over your lifetime, or since the lifetime of 
those who taught you? 
A.   Ulithian:  Ifa sangal yal deur mo dedeur susuwel doh irel yam bubudoh yesa holadoh 
igla? Hare sa change tangi yathkawe ho k’kai mor irel sensei kala yam?

Interviewee in English: 
There have been so many changes in weaving compared to 
the old days. First, let’s look at the color. There are so many 
different colors of thread these days that people are using.  
When we see the woven lavalava these days, they don’t look 
like the lavalava that we used to see and would immediately 
recognized because they used the usual colors. Now, people 
use so many different colors that some lavalava look like the 
striped towels that we buy in the stores. Even the styles have 
changed. Back in the old days, we only had about 3 or 4 types 
of lavalava. Nowadays, people make different types of peg 
(plain lavalava), peg flak (plain lavalava with stripes), and 
malgur (lavalava with big dark stripes and small lighter stripes) 
styles, and with all the different kinds of colors. 
 
Interviewer in Ulithian: 
06:14 Ifa sangal mala malgur le ma mak? 
 
Interviewer in English: 
How is the malgur with the supplemental weft? 
 
Interviewee in Ulithian: 
06:16 Tapli meka. 
 
Interviewee in English: 
Like this one. 
 
 
06:18 Question 5  
5.    If you could talk to your great-granddaughter about weaving, what would you want to tell 
her? 
A.   Ulithian:  Hare wochog bo hobe malili ngal lol lom tarfefel irel deur, mada mele hobe 
kangalur hare hodipli hobe kangalur? 
Interviewee in Ulithian: 
06:38 Ila, tor layi ngo cholopcholop lol bisiy mo mangey le idipli

Interviewee in English: 
I don’t have kids, but my sisters and brothers have plenty of 
kids. But, I would like to tell them about the importance of 
lavalava and the many different things that we use lavlava for.  
When they know the importance of lavalava, then they will 
have the will to learn how to weave.
