[Letter from John A. Lomax to Harold Spivacke]
Port Aransas, Texas 3/26/ 19 39
Dear Mr. Spivacke:
This bunch is my present choice, though you might wait until I hear from San Antonio
again. I'll shoot the letter on as soon as it comes, at least by the middle of the week. By
then Mr. Thornbush will have information enough to make his own choice direct. I hope he
will take over at once all further correspondence.
The San Angelo bunch are a robust group of Westerners, nearly all sone of cattlemen. Mr.
Thornbush, I suppose, can get some idea of their performance by having Mr. Broome send
on some sample records. They dress their parts, though, as a matter of fact, they are all,
probably, college graduates.

Your wire came a week ago. No machine as yet. I am still hoping.
Always sincerely, John A. Lomax
