PREFACE . 
To 
MY 
FRIENDS AND THE PUBLIC: 
Is introducing to you my collection of new and suc-
cessful songs, allow me to express my gratitude for the 
many favors you have already bestowed upon me. 
It is 
your applause which has acted like a 
beacon fire unto me, 
and pointed out the most certain way to possible success. 
Had it not been for your leniency without doubt I 
should 
have stranded on the shore of failure; but encouraged as 
I 
have been by your applause, I 
now feel safe as the great 
Count Johannes, never to be crushed 
And ever the 
public's obliged servant, 
COD LIVER OIL. 
sung with great suce.eas by J. IL CONROY. 
I'M a 
poor married man, and wretched is my life; 
Six years I've been married to a 
very sick wife. 
From morning till night she does nothing but sigh, 
And the neighbors all said she was going to die. 
A 
young friend of mine called on me one day, 
And saw that my wife she was pining away ; 
He very soon told me how she would get strong, 
By drinking an oil made by Doctor De John. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Doctor De John, oh! Doctor De John, 
Your cod liver oil is so pure and so strong, 
I 
think on my life 171 be under the soil, 
If my wife keeps on drinking your cod liver oil. 
I 
bought her a 
bottle, which gave her delight, 
And soon the contents she put out of sight ; 
I 
bought her a 
dozen, which vanished the same, 
Till I 
thought she'd take cod liver oil on the brain. 
'Twas then that I 
noticed with wonder and doubt, 
My wife she was getting most wonderfully stout; 
And when she got stout, of course she got strong, 
'Till I 
own I 
was jealous of Doctor De John. 
Oh ! Doctor De John, etc. 
We courted and cooed like two turtle doves, 
But lately my wife, she's brought home boxing gloves, 
And if I 
do not keep as quiet as a 
mouse, 
It's round after round I'm sent round the house.

COD LIVER OIL.—Concluded. 
'Twas only last night, the servant named Janes, 
Says " Master, your Misses has brought you home twins." 
For two morP blessed babies I'll now have to foil, 
Oh! how I 
wish she'd stop drinking his cod liver oil. 
Oh ! Doctor De John, etc. 
Our own little Billy, he's getting so fat. 
All day like a 
porpoise he rolls on the mat, 
And even the cat has a 
new coat of silk, 
For my wife says that oil is much better than milk. 
I 
can't get a 
bit cooked, do just what I 
like, 
She's turned against cooking, and is gone on a 
strike, 
And even the kettle, when it begins for to boil, 
You'd swear it was singing out cod liver oil. 
Oh! Doctor De John, etc. 
Oh 1 
Doctor De John, who taught you the art 
Of making cod liver, to break a 
man's heart ? 
For if she continues, you shortly will -see, 
Your cod liver will make a 
short liver of me. 
My house it resembles a 
big doctor shop, 
It's filled with your bottles from bottom to top, 
And when my wife's dead, and she's under the soil, 
I'll write on her tombstone, " Here lies Cod Liver Oil." 
Oh I 
Doctor De John, etc.

JEREM IAH M cCARTY, 
Sung by J. H. CONROY. 
His name it was McCarty, 
Some folks they call him Mick; 
In his buttonhole he carries a 
pop, 
And he wears a 
walking-stick. 
His hair is the color of an onion, 
His eyes are very weak; 
The ladies call him a 
terrier, 
And you should hear him squeak I 
CHORUS. 
Tra la in, tra in in, 
My darling Mick, 
I'll meet you on the corner, 
When the boys are on the strike. 
I'll treat you to some buttermilk, 
I'll meet you at the party ; 
The pride of all the ladies 
Is Jeremiah McCarty. 
His neck- tie is his father's socks, 
He sleeps down in a 
cellar ; 
He looks just like a 
cigar sign, 
With a 
ten cent umbrella. 
His boots are made of paper, 
For his board he never pays ; 
He'll stand upon the corner, 
And this is what he says ; 
Tra In I
A, etc. 
He combs his hair about twice a 
year, 
He never wears a 
collar ; 
His mother owns a 
peanut stand, 
It's worth about a 
dollar. 
His father peddles fish- balls, 
He has a 
trombone voice; 
'You should hear him singing tra In la, 
He thinks he sings it nice. 
Tra in in. etc. 
CURIOUS THOUGHTS. 
Written and sung by GEORGE HARRIS, the great Motto Vocalist and 
Composer. 
How funny it is when to think you commence 
Of things you imagine without common sense. 
I'll tell you a 
few I've thought in my song 
If Beecher should ever refuse a 
sweet kiss, 
Which some parsons do think is the summit of bliss, 
If a 
man should be found who with bitterness cried 
When he heard that his mother-in-law she had died., 
Then I 
am willing to own that my subject is wrong. 
If the swells that we meet in the street day and night 
Should lose their white neck-ties, they'd be in a 
fright; 
To them ' tis breakfast and dinner, and their chief delight. 
If a 
young lady marries, and her husband gets tight, 
And tells her he stops at the club every night, 
You can bet he tells stories; she must not him believe; 
He's got some other girl, and wants her to deceive, 
And the length of his wife's tongue he ought to receive. 
If our cute city fathers should do what they say— 
From the boys take their fireworks so cruel away, 
On the Fourth of July there'll be the deuce to pay; 
If a 
law should come out to make feminines dress 
As their grandmothers did, they'd look very much less— 
Would be bustles enough the girls could throw away 
To fill up with cotton the whole of New York Bay. 
I 
hope they'll not do it. 
Boys, what do you say ? 
If the Tabs would keep quiet, and let Hayes alone, 
I 
think he'd drink lager—cold water disown; 
'Tis a 
much better drink for the man on the throne. 
If old Peter Cooper his wind-bag should burst, 
Or from Sankey another fat sheep should be lost; 
If a 
policeman was found that could not tell a 
lie, 
He'd be appointed commissioner by Mayor Smith Ely. 
I 
will tell you the rest in the sweet by and by.

MeCAFFREY'S OLD HORSE. 
Written and sung with great success by 3. U. CONROY. 
I'm going to sing you a 
ditty, 
I'm sure it will cause you to smile; 
It's about an old horse in the city, 
That sticks out his tail in grand style ; 
Although the poor creature looks lazy, 
Not a 
horse in the land, P11 go bail, 
Could travel so quick and so easy, 
Providing he got a 
square meal. 
SPOKEN. —I 
stabled the old horse in the rear of a 
tene-
ment house in Mulberry street, and the alley going 
through was so narrow that I 
would wear the shoulder-
blades of my coat off when I 
would be going to the 
stable. 
The old horse could go through on a 
trot. 
The 
gang played a 
trick on me one fine morning. 
They fat-
tened him up, and I 
could not get him out of the stable. 
I 
was compelled to knock the roof off and hoist him out 
with a 
derrick into Callahan's yard next door me. 
I 
picked him up and carried him out through the hallway, 
put the harness on him, and he lay down on me ; and I've 
heard of men being beastly drunk, but the horse waa 
as drunk as a 
human being. 
But I 
tell you— 
CHORUS. 
He was a 
horse that could travel, 
Providing you kept him well fed; 
He could trot upon stones or on gravel, 
And make other horses in dread. 
Some say the horse was short-winded, 
Some say he got nothing to eat; 
More say he was high-minded, 
And that he was full of conceit. 
(1)

lYieCAPPREY'S OLD HORSE.—Concluded. 
But while the poor horse was living, 
He eat many bundles of hay ; 
But now that he's dead we'll forgive him, 
For a 
horse like a 
dog has his day. 
SpoKEN.---I was coming from the Fulton Market, and. 
when I 
reached the corner of Woliver and Warrick street, 
a 
fire engine came around on a 
quick turn, and being in 
the neighborhood, the pole hit me and knocked me into 
an ash barrel. 
I 
was mad enough to put a 
head on the 
barrel, but I 
did not. 
I 
left the horse and wagon and ran 
down to the fire, thinking it was my own little home was 
blazing. 
When I 
reached the fire the men had a 
rubber 
sheet spread out. 
Says I, " Gentlemen, what's this for ?" 
They said, " To catch little boys and girls." " I'll give 
you a 
hand," and I 
took hold of the sheet. 
They com-
menced throwing looking- glasses and bustles out. 
I, 
getting dry, thought I'd go and get a 
drink. 
I 
had not 
reached ten paces when the hose busted and I 
was wet 
through. 
I 
went back where the firemen were, and they 
commenced laughing at me. " What are you giggling 
at ?" says I. " Oh, nothing, only you are not as dry as 
you were." " No," says I, " and I'll not take so much 
fire water when I 
go for another drink." 
I 
heard a 
girl 
cry for help. 
I 
rushed up to save her. 
I 
had her in 
my arms, and was coming down stairs, when the stairs 
fell in. 
The devil up or down we could get. 
But the 
presence of mind struck me in the small of the back 
about a 
man wrecked at sea, and washed himself ashore 
with a 
piece of soap. 
I 
went into her chamber, got a 
piece of soap, spit on my hands, made a 
lather, and we 
both climbed down safe. 
Then I 
went to look after my 
wagon. 
The boys had my horse divided among them. 
But many a 
time in speaking to my friends, I 
would 
say — 
Re was the horse, eta.

THE COAL YARD. 
4114,1 
Written and sung ‘vith immense success by J. H. Coyscrir, 
THE other night I 
went on a 
spree 
With a 
gang of jolly good boys; 
We went a-roaming reund the town, 
And cut up the devil's own noise ; 
We went to balls and parties, 
The crowd was rather hard, 
And. I 
woke up in the morning, 
Sleeping in a 
coal yard. 
SPOKEN'.—I'll never forget the first night I 
went on g 
spree. 
There was myself, Dan Hickey, McInabeulah, 
Denny McLaughlin, Alonzo Mooney, Toss McGilligan, 
and a 
few others. 
We stopped in one bucket-shop to get 
a 
drink, and they had two long pieces of string with 
handles on them, hanging from a 
clock. 
Says Alonzo, 
" 
Take hold and pull while I 
watch the hands on the in-
dicator, which tells how many custard pies you can stand 
to have broken on your chest." 
I 
grabbed hold the 
rings, the bar-tender turned on the steam, and I 
could 
not let go, when he gave me a 
full dose of electricity, as 
he called it. 
I 
says, " What do you call that ?" 
He says, 
" 
that's a 
battery ; were you never on a 
battery before ?" 
"Yes," says I, " of course; I 
landed there twenty-five 
years ago this coming Centennial ; but I 
was never down 
on a 
battery more than I 
am on that. 
What is it for ?" 
says I. " Circulating the blood," says he. " Well," says 
I, " what little I 
have I'll keep for myself. 
I 
can't afford 
to dis-tri-bute." 
We all parted for home, and when I 
sized myself up (as the gang call it) I 
found my white 
pantaloons dyed black. 
I 
looked around me and found 
I 
was— 
CHORUS. 
Down in a 
coal yard, 
There I 
lay all night, 
And when I 
awoke in the morning, 
I 
found I 
was jolly and tight,

THE COAL YARD.— Continued. 
Laying upon a 
coal heap, 
That I 
knew nothing about ; 
And when I 
went to my home, 
The old woman she bounced me out. 
13 
We roamed around the live long night, 
Enjoying ourselves with fun ; 
At Harry Hill's we drank our fill 
Of whiskey and hot rum, 
And while we were a-drinking, 
The bums we did discard, 
For happy as a 
king was I, 
Laying in a 
coal yard. 
SPOKEN.—The last spree I 
went on was onintentionally. 
I 
lived at No. 62 Cherry street, in a 
French fiat, and it's 
not a 
flat that's telling you it. 
I 
was just married two 
years to a 
little Cork woman. I 
left the house and started 
to take the pledge. 
I 
looked into the society room, and 
there were sixteen ahead of me. " Oh 1" says I, " there 
is a 
chance for me to get a 
couple of powders before 
going in." I 
went into a 
liquor store and took a 
couple 
of drinks, went back and took the pledge and put it in 
my pocket; and as I 
was crossing Chambers' street on 
my way home, along came the Killmare Guards, playing 
the " White Cockade." 
That's my favorite tune. I 
stood 
watching them, and as they came near, I 
saw one-eyed 
Higgins was captain. 
Says I, " If I 
don't get on the 
blind side of him I'll have to take a 
drink." I 
crossed 
over on the other side of the way, and, bad luck to me, 
I 
got on the bright side of him. 
He saw me, and called 
the company to halt. 
They all started for a 
bar-room, 
and he called me. I 
says, " Sorry a 
drink I 
can take to-
night." " Well," says he, " you can take a soda." 
" 
Very well, I'll have one." 
He whispered something to 
.. the bar-tender in Irish. 
I've heard of a 
soda with a 
stick

in it, but he put a 
three-mast schooner in mine. I 
drank 
soda that night till I 
walked home in an express wagon, 
drawn by boys. I 
says, " I'll not let the old woman 
know I 
am tight," so I 
struck up a 
bit of a 
song in this 
style: 
When I 
was a 
boy in my father's own edifice, 
Tender and bare like a 
pig in the sty, 
Out of the door shure I 
looked with a 
steady face, 
Who but Pat Casey the piper came by. 
SPOKEN.—I 
just reached this part of the song', and out 
came the landlord, who was an Englishman, (
ititates the 
landlord) " Look '
ere, I 
caun't endure this nonsense every 
night." " What nonsense ?" says I. " Is it fiay singing 
you call nonsense, landlord? I 
think you al'e too pre. 
posterious. 
You are carrying this thing too far. 
It's 
tk
about time you should drop on yourself." 
Wi , 1 
that he 
dropped me - 
just two flights of stairs. 
The ctld woman 
called out from the top of the landing, " Is that you, 
Owen ?" I 
replied it was. 
She says, " What happened 
you ?" " Oh," says I, " nothing, except a 
boy as wash-
ing windows with a 
sponge and let it fall on my head." 
" 
Oh, is that all ? 
I 
thought you were hit with a 
bung-
starter." 
She came down and says to the landlord, 
" 
What's up, Mr. Montague, with you and the old man ?" 
He replied, " I 
shan't have him disturbing the neighbors." 
The old woman opened out on him in Irish, and this is 
what she said, " Tasha shana ?niska Poole De Wallah 
Crueson the Gallow De Shanovara Presta Malime ye Oma-
don ye." 
I 
says, " That's me darling," and she says, 
" 
Go with the gang you be with ;" so I 
started oft and 
was picked up as usual— 
Down in a 
coal yard, etc.

And when lie has on his Hibernian dress, 
He is a

A 
widdy fell in love with me, 
In Erie she has stocks, 
She has a 
palace in Central Park, 
Built upon the rocks. 
SPOKEN.—And every Sunday, dressed in my cross-grain 
de Bashall suit, I 
visit the little palace, chat love for 
awhile; she then calls her only son in a 
musical voice, 
and says: 
CHORUS. 
Paddy, come here to your mother, 
That's the darling dear, 
Don't you cause any bother, 
Run out for a 
quart of beer. 
Don't go near the Dutchman's avick, 
You know he is a

But go around where it is cheaper and betwr, 
Go around to Teddy McGlynn. 
I've taken her over to Hoboken 
On many a 
summer's day, 
And there upon the Elysian Fields 
Our figures we'd display. 
Her's was nate and trim, me boys, 
Three fifty was her weight; 
She'd make me stand outside of the boat, 
For she wouldn't fit'n a 
sate. 
Paddy, come here, etc. 
In a 
snug retreat at Central Park, 
We went one beautiful night, 
An' there we had a 
jug of the best--
Both of us got tight. 
A 
policeman he came along, 
And both of us took away, 
And the next morning down at Tombs, 
I 
had both fines to pay. 
Paddy, ronie 11.6>rci, ot-t! 
TWEED'S CONFESSION. 
Oompoped and sung with immense success by GEORGE HARMS. 
Yo doubt you've in the papers read of a 
man so great and 
bold, 
Who to his lawyer, Townsend, did his sins in life unfold. 
The Attorney-General Fairchild it to Albany did bring. 
'Twas the confession of Bill Tweed, the boss of all the 
ring. 
To you a 
secret I 
will tell, which I 
want you all to keep, 
I 
stole it from his pocket when old Fairchild was asleep, 
And every item copied—each funny thing did take ; 
I'll tell you the confession all which old Boss Tweed did 
make. 
He paid for training Morrissey when Heenan he did fight, 
Bought- the collars that Spin°la wears, that make him 
such a 
fright ; 
Bought shoes for all the children which Brigham Young 
did claim ; 
Bought a 
bustle for Miss Anthony, and marked it with 
her name; 
Bought high-heeled boots for Sunset Cox, to make him 
big and tall ; 
Some medicine for Billy Birch, to reduce him thin and 
small ; 
Some tallow for the Russian fleet, that they might eat the 
more; 
Bought Mike Norton a 
new chowder pot for Coney Island 
shore. 
Bought clean shirts for the aldermen, a 
thing they sel-
dom use ; 
Found a 
dump place for our garbage, which the county 
does refuse ; 
Made Baldy Smith a 
pious man—bought Dr. Walker's 
pants ; 
Gets Parson Beecher's courage up when a 
pretty girl he 
wants. 
(1) 
TWEED'S CONFESSION.—Conauded. 
Ee made Fred. Douglass shed his skin—become so fair 
and white ; 
Mich Hayes a 
whiskey cocktail strong, till that T. A. B. 
got tight ; 
Toplease Comptroller Kelly, for a 
new silk hat did pay; 
He )nly wears it once a 
year—upon St. Patrick's Day. 
He "Lade policemen honest men, that would not tell a 
lie; 
He paid the people's dog- tax, and to save their pups did 
try ; 
He bought girders for the Post-office, that rotten roof to 
save, 
Which fell, and sent three working-men to an untimely 
grave ; 
He bought a 
cloth to dry the tears which ran down Aimee's 
nose, 
When she and Josh Hart fainted 'cause her dog it ram-
bling goes. 
He paid the cash to get divorce for each new-made wife 
in town, 
And designed the Jefferson Market tower, like a 
pepper-
box upside down. 
He bit Evarts's little finger off, which he raises to object; 
Found Charley Ross and Sa.nkey's sheep, both together I 
suspect ; 
Made Theodore Tilton run away with Mrs. Woodhull 
sweet ; 
Ben Butler sell his stolen spoons and everybody cheat ; 
Made Grant give back the presents all he from the nation 
got; 
Made Babcock sell his whiskey-kegs in one extensive lot; 
Paid back the money the ring stole and from the city 
took, 
And went himself to Ludlow street when the poor Boss 
got broke.

light, And the Wo- man in White,was—the Woman in White. 
I 
treated her twice to strawberry-ice, 
And nine oyster patties she put out of sight, 
She ate jelly and jam, and chicken, and ham, 
Till her face like her dress was decidedly white; 
Her mouth was so small and her appetite large, 
"[was awful, 'twas awful 
Some two, ten and six was the moderate charge 
For feeding the Woman in White.—Cuo. 
Her style was so nice, I 
laughed at the price, 
I 
expended on Polly Ann Sarah Ann Wright; 
I 
quickly proposed, and the bargain was closed, 
That I 
soon should marry the Woman in White. 
But to think of her now brings the tear to mine eye, 
It's awful, it's awful 1 
She's a 
fright, and a 
sight, and a 
horrible guy, 
No longer the Woman in White. 
SPOKEN.—After our marriage she looked as white as a 
ghost 
that had been through the court and been whitewashed, as 'white as 
a 
marble Venus with its clothes on. 
Fluttered by excitement, I 
gave her the first thing to drink I 
could lay my hand on, or she 
would have fainted; I 
thought I 
gave her cognac, alas! it was hair 
dye, nitrate of silver; she drank, with what effect Wilkie Collirs 
and the next verse alone can tell— Ono. 
The notion is new, but it also is true, 
She swallowed her hair dye that horrible night, 
Her skin changed its hue to an indigo blue, 
Which made her at once a 
most terrible fright. 
There's a 
moral to come, in a 
present I 
think, 
It's awful, it's awful 1 
But hair dye's a 
lotion that no one should drink, 
Ai did the fair Woman in White.—Cno.

DDFIFY, YOU'RE GIVING US TAFFY. 
Written by H ARRY BENNETT, and sung by J. CONROY. 
I'm a 
naturalized citizen of this great land, 
And I'm proud of the honor, I'm sure; 
In politics I'm quite a 
prominent man, 
And respected by rich and by poor. 
Now, I 
try to be civil to every one, 
But they've not the same manners toward me, 
For it's up and down as I'm strolling along 
These words they will say unto me : 
CHORUS. 
" 
How are you, Macduff ? 
Don't you think you 
totigh ?" 
Expressions like these make me wrathy, 
And whenever I 
say, " Lave off with your play," 
They say, " Duffy, you're giving us taffy." 
They'll tell me to go put my feet in a 
frame, 
And go chase myself round the square ; 
And they say that if Barnum knew I 
was alive 
He'd have me caged up with the benr. 
Now, I 
know I'm not handsome, but this much rfla sure— 
To do right I 
always did try, 
And the next man that tells me to sit down on myself 
I'll put a 
lump over his eye. 
How are you. etc. 
They say my feet occupy the whole street, 
With my bunions the people can't pass, 
And say that my face would stop the street cars, 
And my ears just look like a 
jackass ; 
But let them all talk until they are sick; 
They're jealous because they're not me. 
I'm a 
sound Irishman, and that they'll find out, 
And they'll never find taffy in me. 
How are you, etc.

are a 
jolly band, 
The greatest in the land ; 
We once enjoyed a 
social glass 
As long as we could stand; 
But now we've changed our ways, 
And look for better days; 
Have joined that band of happiness 
Called the T. A. B. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, we have joined the army of the T. A. B., 
We nothing drink but Crot

Since we have joined the T. A. B. 
MARCH AND CHORUS. 
There we go now, give us a 
show now, 
Marching away with the fife and the drum; 
All tell the story, we go for glory, 
Soldiers to fight for the kingdom come. 
We talk of our water pure, 
'While whiskey you secure ; 
We are on the for glory, 
The shortest path, that sure , 
No matter how we're dry, 
We don't drink on the sly, 
Cold water is our watchword, 
And the T. A. B. ou,. cry. 
Yes, we have joined, etc. 
There we go now, etc. 
You see how strong we seem ; 
Bad whiskey's but a 
dream, 
'Tis 13ut the skim-milk of the world, 
Cold water snre's the cream ; 
But we are allowed to take, 
If our pledge we, do not break. 
A 
drop of the old " cratur," boys, 
Just for the stomach's sake. 
Yes, we have joined, etc. 
There we go now, etc.—

THE DASHING U. 
S. 
MARINES. 
Originally sung by Coo, M URPHY, VANDEMARK, SCOBIE, and limo 
TER, at 15 West licuston street. 
OH, gay and dashing boys are we, the bold U. S. Marines. 
We march and fight for Uncle Sam, and eat his pork and 
beans. 
To charm the pretty girls likewise we're not at all afraid, 
With muskets bright we take their eyes when out upon 
parade. 
Eyes right, boys, when the fife begins to play ; 
Stiff as stach, we march, we march away. 
With heads thrown back, in our glory then we're seen ; 
Oh, how the charmers smile at the dashing U. S. Marines. 
Beneath our starry banner boldly on we stride, 
Our courage, too, for fighting has travelled far and wide. 
It's high upon the maintop, there we blaze away, 
Like gallant soldiers, foremost in the fray. 
(Repeat last four lines.) 
CHORUS. 
Eyes right, boys, when the fife begins to play ; 
Stiff as starch, we march, we march away. 
With heads thrown back, in our glory then we're seen, 
The pride of all the land are the dashing U. S. Marines. 
And when the summons comes to fight we bid the girls 
adieu, 
And far upon the stormy seas the foes we must pursue; 
But in our hearts we fondly keep the sweethearts we 
adore. 
It's true to them we'll always be until we march ashore. 
Left foot first. 
We're the boys that have no fear.

THE DASHING U. S. MARINES.—Concluded. 
" 
Oh, how sweet 1" cries each dainty little dear. 
They wave their hands when our gallant ranks are seen ; 
The pride of all the land are the dashing U. S. Marines. 
For love and home and beauty we will always fight; 
To rally round our banner still is our delight. 
Amid the cannon's thunder, in the van are we 
To fight for freedom on the stormy sea. 
(Repeat last four lines.) 
Eyes right, boys, etc. 
Then, ladies dear, where'er we go we drink success to 
you, 
And though we may be years away, our hearts will still 
be true. 
Though sailors find a 
sweetheart fond in every port they've 
seen, 
The same is not the case with us, the bold U. S. Marines. 
File left—march, when the drums are beating bond; 
Halt—front face 
Oh, we are the boys so proud. 
Well never say die, though we leave this charming geene, 
For light and gay's the heart of the dashing U. S. Marines. 
With splendid regimental gloves, all lily-white, 
And full of fame and glory, we're spoiling for a 
fight. 
It's high upon the maintop, there we blaze away, 
Like gallant soldiers, foremost in the fray

BIDDY THE BALLET GIRL. 
Written by J. BRADLEY, and sung with great success by JACK CONROY, 
every evening, at Gal.'s, 15 West Houston street. 
I AM a 
gay laboring man, 
And I 
have a 
beautiful daughter, 
Who never did care much for work, 
It's her mother's own wish that she aughter ; 
It seems that she fancied the stage, 
So I 
granted her final request, 
And now she's a 
beautiful dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarty; 
She brings home at night, and at matinees, 
Large baskets of flowers, and also bouquets. 
Oh, she is my only daughter, 
And I 
am the man that taught her 
To wear spangled clothes, and go round on her toes, 
And there is no such a 
girl as Biddy. 
When salary day does arrive, 
All trouble and toil it does smother, 
For, just the day before that there was a 
kick, 
The girl had been scolded by her mother ; 
She's courting a 
clerk in the bank, 
Who sees her safe home at the door, 
And pays a 
big gang in the gallery, 
To applaud in a 
perfect uproar. 
On the stage, etc. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid ; 
I 
thought I 
would go to the theatre, 
And take the old woman along ; 
In the parquette in front I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance, 
My son Danny was up in the tier; 
He cried, " Go in, sister Biddy," 
When they bounced him right out on his ear. 
On the stage, etc. 
WATER ON THE BRAIN. 
Written and sung by PETE CANNON, at all the principal Theatres 111 
the country. 
TIT always been a 
drunkard, since the day that I 
was 
born; 
I 
never could resist, tho' it causes me much pain, 
My head is swelling lately, and I'm broken up completely, 
And all my friends imagine I've got water on the brain. 
CHORUS. 
Me head is swelling lately, 
And I'm broken up completely, 
And all my friends imagine 
I've got water on the brain. 
I 
went into a 
porter house to get a 
glass of whiskey, 
When a 
man came up to stab me, and I 
thought he was 
insane ; 
He made at me some fearful blows, I 
knocked him off and 
broke his nose ; 
To see me fight you'd. not suppose I'd water on the 
brain. 
Me head is swelling, etc. 
My wife is home and in .her bed, and sleeping very 
quietly ; 
She says that I'm a 
drunken brute, and that I 
treat her 
mean ; 
She calls me an in-ter-loper and a 
good-for-nothing toper, 
She says it's whiskey, and not water, that I've got on 
the brain. 
Me head is swelling, etc. 
And now I 
must be going for to get a 
glass of liquor, 
Me throat is in a 
favor and I'm getting dry again ; 
The doctor told me I 
must take some whiskey for me 
stomach's sake, 
For whiskey on the stomach, beats water on the brain. 
Me head is swelling, etc.

THEY STOLE AWAY MY GIRL. 
MARCHING WITH THE BOYS IN BLUE. 
AIR.—" The Railroad Guide." 
sung with great success by JOHN MITRritr, at Gux's ENTERPRISE, 15 
West Houston street. 
I'm a man of many troubles; I've always failed in life; 
I 
never had a 
friend, indeed; I 
never won a 
wife. 
I've often loved a 
pretty girl. 
Before my love prevailed 
Some other fellow came along, and then my courtship 
failed. 
In boyhood, when to school I 
went, the darlings I 
would 
tease; 
I 
added up their little sums—did all I 
could to please, 
And when, fool-like, I 
did get my brain into a 
whirl, 
Some great big blubber interfered, and stole away my girl. 
I 
once went to Central Park, to see the ladies skate; 
A 
damsel gliding on the ice, she quickly sealed my fate ; 
I 
tried to pass before her, a 
glimpse of her to spy, 
We both came in collision, and upon the ice did lie. 
Our skates they got entangled in a 
true-lover's knot; 
Our hearts they beat together; I 
was dead gone on the 
spot. 
I 
wished upon the frozen snow my love there to enfold. 
She said, '• Why, what a 
fool you are to spoon there in the 
cold. 1' 
If I 
dance in any ball-room, or go to see the play, 
There villains surely will come up and take my girl away; 
They call it only joking, but it is no joke to me ; 
I 
only wish those naughty men would let those darlings be. 
Now will some lady pity take, and judge me by my case ? 
I 
look with anxious eye upon each sweet and pretty face. 
I 
adore each laughing dimple—I 
admire each raven curl; 
But say the word, and I'll take care that no one steals 
my girl. 
Sung with great success by GEO. 'HUNTER, at GILL'S ENTERPRSR, 15 West 
Houston street. 
I LOVE to see the soldiers bold, 
I 
love our sailors brave ; 
I 
love the martial boys in blue, 
Who fought our flag to save. 
I 
love to hear the drum pum, pum, 
And see the bayonets bright; 
I 
love when the trumpet sounds, 
That calls them to the fight. 
CHORUS. 
When the band does sweetly play, 
I'm eager for the fray ; 
I 
care not for danger, 
I 
fear not the foe; 
It's my chief delight, 
Beneath our banner bright, 
When marching, when marching, 
When marching with the boys in blue. 
I 
often think of Bunker Hill, 
Where noble Warren fell; 
I 
love to hear the old men talk, 
Their deeds of valor tell--
To hear of Lafayette and Lee, 
That well our battles won, 
And better still were the deeds 
Of our great Washington. 
When the band, etc. 
I 
cry success to Uncle Sam, 
To every stripe and star, 
To every soldier in the land, 
To every gallant tar ; 
To every one that bravely fought, 
To freedom's cause proved true, 
I 
wish them every joy, in life, 
Those darling boys in blue. 
When the band, etc. 
AVENGE CHARLEY. 
Sung with great success by J. H. CONROY 
HE'S a 
swell well known in town, the ladies' peb was he, 
He wears a 
tie of rainbow shade, it is a 
sight to see. 
His kids he never wears at all, he keeps them for a 
show ; 
Each charming girl cries what a 
swell, as up the street 
he'll go. 
CHORUS. 
With his da, da, da! how do, ta, tit 
When marching to and fro ; 
He charms each that meets him there, 
Does Avenue Charley, oh I 
-At evening hour he does arise, and dress himself with care, 
Then go upon some hotel stoop, with consequential air. 
As each girl passed, at her he'd smile, upon his cane he 
leans ; 
When darkness comes he slyly goes, to buy his plate 
of beans. 
With his da, da, etc. 
He rolls his own cigarette, to theatre goes and ball, 
When he a 
bill-board ticket gets, he does outshine them 
all ; 
When morning dawns, his night's work done, he toddles 
home to bed, 
Does wash his handkerchief and shirt, and irons them 
'neath his head. 
On the piano plays a 
tune, sings, " My dream of love is 
o'er." 
He wears a watch- chain, but no watch, with Simpson 
that's in store ; 
But what cares he ; he's made his mark, an 
spent with 
ease a 
day, 
And thus, from daylight until dark he whiles the hours 
away. 
With his da, da, etc. 
THE COAL HEAV1ERS. 
Sting with great nuccess by CONROY and ISILTRPIIY, at GILL's, 15 West 
Houston street. 
OH! here we are, two Lackawanna spooners, 
While we're here keep your eye upon us; 
We load coal boats from Harlem to Gowanus, 
Ha !
ha ! the two selected spooners of the gang. 
When we reach home, our families we embrace, 
And eat our meals with elegance and grace, 
With opposition shovelers we long to have a 
race 
Ha ! ha ! the two selected spooners of the gang. 
CHORUS. 
As thro' the streets we walk away like soldiers, 
And the baskets and the shovels we carry on our 
shoulders ; 
And for to get a 
job, there's none that could be bolder 
Than the two selected spooners of the gang. 
On Saturday night we stand upon the corner, 
Along with the gang that has the roll of honor. 
At Hibernia Hall we're going to raise a 
banner 
To represent the Lackawanna gang. 
-We all get shaved in the one barber-shop, 
And use the one razor, lather, brush and cup, 
And for bay rum or Tonic we long to have a 
sup, 
For to stimulate the Lackawanna gang. 
As thro' the streets, etc. 
We accumulated wealth by hard work and endurance, 
With other scallawags we have no interference, 
We have been well tried by work and perseverance, 
The two selected spooners of the gang. 
With the General Committee we are two great big cards, 
Like Muldoon the Solid Man, we hold our grip in the 
ward; 
We could put ye on the pipes, or the city Boulevard, 
Oh ! the two selected spoouers of the gang. 
As thro' the street; etc.

on the ground she walks up - on And her 
Now where she lives, and what's her name, 
I 
don't intend to tell, 
For certain sure she'd soon be quizzed 
By every noble swell; 
You may see me on a 
Sunday, if 
The weather it is fine, 
As I 
takes my walk, and on my arm, 
Is the girl what I 
calls " mine."—Cao. 
There's servant-maids, and other maids, 
What's dealers at my store, 
They winks their eye, so I 
winks mine, 
In fun—but nothing more; 
If a 
duchess wished to marry me, 
I'd beg leave to decline, 
I'd rather live on bread and cheese, 
With the girl what I 
calls mine.—C°. 
'Twits on last Sunday afternoon, 
I 
plucked up nerve to pop, 
The question, if she'd have me, and 
My wegebles and shop. 
She didn't say " no," she didn't say 
But she said she'd " drop a 
line," 
'Cause so very bashful and so shy, 
Is the girl what I 
calls mine. 
SPOKEN.—I 
do believe she'd blush herself to death if anybody'd 
ict her; but it's a 
ton of coals to a 
pint of gooseberries she answers

LARRY McGEE'S WEDDING. 
sung with great success by J. 11. CONROY, St GILL'S ENTERPRISE, 15 West 
Houston street. 
PAY attention awhile, and I'll sing you a 
ditty, 
About the grand wedding of Larry McGee, 
Who dwelt in a 
fashionable part of the city, 
In an elegant mansion in Avenue D— 
About the grand time we had at the wedding, 
Where whiskey and fun flew around so free, 
And the dancing and singing got the room ringing, 
At the grand wedding of Larry McGee. 
There was Con Donohue with his old fiddle, 
McGuinness the fishman, and Jerry McShane; 
O'Brien and O'Callahan, and Timothy Widdle, 
Who brought to the wedding his new accordeon. 
There was big Andy Fagin, the great whiskey drinker, 
Barney Fitzgibbons and Dennis Farlee • 
McCloskey the butcher, old Doyle the tinker, 
Were welting the floor at gay Larry -McGee's. 
The guests of both sexes all ate very hearty, 
And crammed themselves well into the wind pipe ; 
An accident happened to Mollie McCarty, 
Who half choked herself with a 
large piece of tripe. 
You ought to see Riley sail into the mutton, 
He caused the ladies to titter with glee ; 
He fasted two weeks, the dirty old glutton, 
To clear off the table at Larry McGee's.

LARRY McGEE'S WEDDING.—Concluded. 
When the supper was over, the accordeon and. fiddle 
Struck up the grand wedding of Bally Poreen ; 
The bride made a 
call upon Timothy Widdle, 
Who sang the night Larry was stretched on the green. 
McGuinness the fishinan sang " Croppy By Galia," 
O'Holohan gave us the Boy's Traleigh ; 
And Kitty McNally sang the Sprig of Shillaleh, 
At the grand wedding of Larry McGee. 
We danced and we sang for two hours and a 
quarter, 
And then we drank whiskey until we were sick ; 
When big Andy Fagin swore the whiskey was water, 
And Flaherty levelled him out with a 
stick. 
The ladies they roared and they cried blue blazes, 
And. Roach broke his fiddle on the back of Farlee, 
And Doyle seized a 
dumpling, bless us and save us, 
Which he stuffed in the mouth of poor Mrs. McGee. 
When Larry now saw that his friends had some liquor, 
And 
if he'd not stop them, some harm it would come, 
He told them ' twas twelve o'clock by the ticker, 
And to fill up their glasses before going home. 
They did so and drank a 
toast from Pat Riley, 
Who hoped before long a 
young Larry to see; 
The bride gave a 
smile and bowed so genteelly, 
That wound up the wedding of Larry McGee.

BALLINAMUCK BRIGADE. 
Sting by J. 
IL CONROY, nusTER, MURPHY, SCOBIE and VAN DE 
MARK. 
I'LL never forget the day, my boys, 
We went out on parade, 
Dressed up in uniform so gay, 
Two soldiers for a 
day, 
With the green flag flying o'er our heads, 
The color that never fades ; 
When we went up to the National Park, 
In the Ballinamuck Brigade. 
CHORUS. 
We march away so neat, 
With new shoes upon our feet ; 
Of the Hoolahan Musketeers we're not afraid; 
And we look so neat and grand, 
With our muskets in our hand, 
While marching in the Ballinamuck Brigade. 
The shooting commenced in the National Park, 
In the afternoon at four ; 
Tim Hoolahan won a 
barrel of coal, 
And Murphy a 
barrel of flour. 
Jim Casey won a 
new black hat, 
Dressed out with a 
white cockade, 
To turn out on St. Patrick's Day, 
In the Ballinamuck Brigade. 
We march, etc. 
And when we got home at night, my boys, 
We dressed up for the ball ; 
We invited all the regiments, 
The Munition Guards and all ; 
And during intermission, 
When we drank our lemonade, 
We gave an exhibition drill 
In the Ballinamuck Brigade. 
We march, eta. 
I'LL LAUGH., AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE 
END OF IT. 
Sung by JOHN MURPHY, to great applause, at Gai.a.:la 
Great Enterprise, 15 
West Houston street. 
'Tis my maxim in life, to avoid bitter strife, 
And to walk thro' this world with a 
smile; 
How I 
pity the man, who to laugh never can, 
With no joy his sad home to beguile. 
Let us live by the way, think how short is our stay, 
Nor kill time with foolish repenting ; 
You act a 
wise part, if you take in your heart, 
Every bright ray of life that is shining. 
CHORUS. 
So a 
fig for despair, I 
will drive away care, 
I 
regret not my life what is passed of it. 
If sorrow draws nigh, to defeat it I'll try ; 
I'll laugh, and that's always the end of it. 
If the girl that I 
love should false to me prove, 
Do you think I 
would sit down and cry ? 
No, I'd start out anew, other darlings pursue, 
And to live out my trouble I'd try. 
I 
will always abide on the bright sunny side, 
The sad wrinkle of woe oft be scorning; 
On, though dense be the shroud of a 
darkening cloud, 
'Tis dispelled by the sunlight of morning. 
So a 
fig for, etc. 
I've oft trusted a 
friend, and got wroug'd in the end, 
Still the sweet cap of joy I 
would quaff; 
And if bad luck it came, not a 
soul would I 
blame, 
But my manhood I'd rouse with a 
laugh. 
Not a 
tear would I 
shed, but be jolly instead, 
For trouble I 
never could borrow ; 
Would with patience abide, till the turn of the tide, 
And the bright sun it shone on the morrow. 
So a

IN

No matter what's the game: 
In business or society. 
Good luck I

I

In love or strife, and all thro' life, 
I

I 
sail'd upon the stormy seas, 
And heard the billows roar ; 
The ship was sinking down with me, 
So I

I

If you once took a

Ton my soul you'd never stop, 
A-thinkinr, of the sweet Poteen. 
Old Bacchus, you deluder, 
With all your coaxing ways, 
You've enslaved me like a

When brought within my gaze. 
Wid whiskey I'm so frisky, 
From my head down to my toes, 
I'd prdise you, oh, my darling, 
To your friends or to your foes.

THE KERRY COW. 
Written by PETE CANNON, and sung, with immense success, by him 
through the country. 
OH, I 
once owned a 
cow 
That was all the world to me. 
She was the fairest creature 
That ever you did see. 
You could milk her in the morning, 
And could milk her in the night; 
And the milk that she would give you 
Would never make you tight. 
Wop a 
darry, arrah Dan, 
Wop a 
duddle, darra, ah 
Wop a 
darry, arrah Dan, 
Wop a 
dairy, idal day. 
Oh, the hay that she was fed on 
Was as fine as any silk; 
And, signs upon the cow, 
She'd give the very best of milk. 
Like " Old Dog Tray," so faithful, 
She carries her tail behind, 
And a 
finer little creature 
Would be very hard to find. 
Wop a 
darry, etc. 
At last I 
got in poverty, 
And had to sell the cow. 
I'd buy her back immediately 
If I 
could get her now, 
For ever since she left me 
I 
haven't had my health, 
And I 
wouldn't sell her off again 
For all the world's wealth.

COMIC DREAM SONG. 
Comp()Fed by GE ORGE HARRIS, the great sensational Cornique, Motto 
Singer and Composer. 
I'VE often sung my patriot's dream of the heroes in this 
land, 
Described to you the noble deeds of our great patriot 
band ; 
But now PH sing the dream of one, who one day getting 
tight, 
Lay speechless in the gutter thro' the darkness of the 
night; 
And just before he morning dawn'd, a 
policeman pass-
ing by, 
He struck the bummer with his club, as he did sleeping 
lie ; 
The drunkard saw one thousand stars, and many a 
comic 
theme ; 
He saw that a 
policeman's club did wake him from his-
dream. 
He saw Brigham Young condemned to live with his thou-
sand mothers-in-law ; 
He saw the Brooklyn Theodore roaming thro' that sleep-
ing car ; 
He saw the temperance lecturer, John B. Gough, very 
tight; 
He saw all Europe's soldiers blowing Turkey out of sight ;-
He saw Professor Haxle:,.- try to prove mankind all 
'Were descended from the monkeys, and. no father had 
at all; 
He saw the giant Sunset . Cox playing polo with old 
Blaine; 
Boss Tweed dancing the " Can Can," when they brought 
. him back from Spain. 
(

He saw the scalp of Sitting Bull worn by Peter Cooper 
as a 
wig, 
And Babcock choking on. his back, having swallowed a 
whiskey keg; 
He saw old Barnum's tattooed Greek marked worse than 
any Turk, 
His mother she took washing in, in the big city of Cork. 
He saw the 8011 of General Grant from the battle run 
away ; 
He went quick to the Treasury, and drew the Colonel's 
pay ; 
He saw the foreign rifle teams each " bull's eye" badly 
miss, 
And Beecher mildly looking round for some one he could 
kiss. 
He saw old Sankey's sheep return from a 
mud scow in 
the bay ; 
Ho saw the mighty Hell Gate rock in fragments blow 
away; 
He saw our silent President smoking a 
cheap cigar; 
Saw -Woodward in Chicago caught, from Europe brought 
afar; 
He saw a 
million angels bright that Moody he had made, 
He saw John Bull thJ Rassians fight, only he was afraid ; 
He saw—that is, he would have seen, more strange things 
as he lay, 
But the policeman marched him off to jail across the way.

On! one evening lately, I 
dressed up nately, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug hat and all, 
And I 
started proudly, while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hibernian Hall. 
Going round a 
corner a 
gang of rowdies— 
Oh! I 
know they're rowdies, for they never work 
Says, let us give this old Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
picnic, boys, and toss, the Turk., 
CHORT,TS. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, nor yet a 
biter, 
But when duty calls I 
never shirk ; 
So I 
tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no picnic when they toss'd the Turk, 
Oh! the big ringleader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien, you had better paint the 
tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it !" 
And he thought 'twas funny when the gang did smile, 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one 'loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk ; 
So I 
tapp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no picnic when they toss'd the Turk, 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, etc. 
Oh! they gathered round me, and thought to pound me, 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick ; 
" 
You can't go behind me," says I, " now mind me, 
If ye stand forninst me I 
can bate ye all." 
Then the gang did face me, and thought to lace me, 
But I 
show'd them tricks I 
learned at Donegal; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for mercy they began to bawl 
SPOKEN. --Well, they looked surprised, and Redheaded 
Mike says, " Who are you ?" " Well," says I, " my name

MY MARY ANN. 
Bung to great applause by Jont,t 
CONROY. 
On, I 
have a 
girl—she looks like a 
queen— 
Her hair it is red, and her age is sixteen; 
She's just like a 
fairy you'd see in your dream, 
And in fact she's the sweetest that ever was seen ; 
She plays the piano, and sings " Aileen Allanna,"i 
With a 
voice so soprano, so low, and so sweet; 
But when she sits down to play " Lakes of Killarney," 
She frightens the people all off from the street. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, you should see Mary, so sly and contrary; 
She's like a 
canary from sweet Tipperary ; 
She is not a 
bit airy ; she ' tends to her dairy, 
So airy—contrary—is my Mary Ann, 
I 
took Mary one night to a 
massacre 
To a 
place down below they call Wall Halla 
And when she got there, she went straight for the grub ; 
The way that she eat was like filling a 
tub. 
She called for the turkey, the quail, and the oysters ; 
She ate onions and garlic, to make her breath sweet; 
'But her mouth when it opened her breath was so strong 
That it knocked the people clean off from their seats. 
Oh, you should see Mary, etc. 
You'll find her at all of the blow-outs and. parties, 
She dances the polka, mazurka and all; 
And when she is at it she goes it so hearty 
,„That she knocks the plaster all off from the wall. 
We were down at McNally's one night at a 
party, 
And to make things look lively, she whipped off her 
shoes. 
Iler feet, when she shook them, threw out such a 
flavor, 
That it drove all the people clean out of the room. 
Oh, you should see Mary, etc. 
A
HURRAH FOR THE FRIENDS OF THE POOR. 
Composed and sung by GEORGE HARRIS, the great Motto Vocalist and 
Composer. 
THROUGHOUT this world we often read 
Of many a 
warrior brave— 
Of statesmen that have won a 
name, 
And did their country save— 
Of great inventions made by men, 
Of battles lost and won— 
Explorers who went forth to die 
'Neath Afric's burning sun. 
CHORUS. 
But give me the man who will bravely stand 
When poverty enters in; 
He comes as a 
friend, your woes to end, 
And a 
victory great to win. 
Though nations may boast of their soldiers bold, 
Who high with pride did soar, 
More blessed in the end is the true-hearted friend' 
Who gives what he can to the poor. 
Abe Lincoln signed his name so bold 
That mankind should be free, 
And Lawrence gave his life so brave 
Upon the stormy sea; 
Great Washington, the prince of men, 
Most wondrous deeds he wrought; 
He made our starry banner free 
By battles great he fought. 
But give me the man, etc. 
HURRAH. FOR THE FRIENDS OF THE POOR. 
Concluded. 
I 
love to read of the warlike deeds, 
But better far I 
love 
The men who work with purpose bold, 
Their kindness great I 
prove. 
Boss Tweed, they say he stole away 
The riches of the land; 
But poor folks then could act as men— 
He was the poor man's friend. 
But give me the man, etc. 
Suppose he made a 
great big raid 
Upon the rich man's gain, 
He gave it out with open hand 
To ease the poor man's pain. 
A 
working man, for labor done 
He got a 
fair day's pay; 
In this New York we all had work, 
And many a 
happy day. 
But give me the man, etc. 
And now I 
will the story tell 
Of one to memory known, 
And never while this world does last 
Will I 
his deeds disown; 
He filled the hungry mouths of all 
At the Chicago fire. 
Jim Fisk, when hunger craved his aid, 
Gave all they could desire. 
But give me the man, etc.

MY 
friends, if you will listen, 
You I 
will surprise. 
It's of a 
charmer I 
met at a 
picnic, 
Whom I 
thought a 
prize. 
Her eyes were dark and gentle, 
And I 
loved her dearer than gold, 
But after a 
year of married life, 
How badly I 
was sold. 
CHORUS. 
Waltzing up to the bar 
Is a 
favorite pastime of mine ; 
I 
always call for strong drink, 
Providing I 
have a 
dime. 
Oh give me gin or whiskey, 
Or old Jamaica rum, 
For since I 
married this beauty 
I've turned out a 
regular bum. 
When our love was young and gay, 
How sweet I 
thought her glance, 
I'd place my arm around her waist 
As we went through the mazy dance. 
Around and around we'd go, 
Mid the multitude so large, 
Oh, how lovely it did seem, 
While waltzing on the barge. 
Waltzing up, etc. 
My married life is an unhappy one, 
I 
have still that plague of a 
wife ; 
go and seek to get a 
divorce, 
So I'll have peace the rest of my life. 
My family numbers six, 
The oldest one is a 
blot, 
For whenever I 
sneak to get a drink, 
He clings to the tail of my coat.

At McCarty on his hump.

Price 33 cents. 
To my darling I 
will always prove true, 
40 
And look on her with a 
smile of love; 
Like a 
sunbeam she's beautiful and bright, 
With eyes like the little stars above. 
CHORUS. 
She's the fairest in all creation, 
Pretty Peggy, charming creature, 
Pretty Peggy, darling loved one, 
Ah 
she's like a 
little bird in the spring. 
(Dance.) 
When you're in her company for a 
while, 
Just look at her curly jet black hair 
Her face is always brightened with a 
smile, 
Faith, none with my jewel can compare. 
She's the fairest, etc. 
The day is coming when I'll wed this pearl, 
The thought of it cheers me on my way ; 
The bells will ring, and the colleens will sing, 
When she names the happy wedding-day. 
CHORUS. 
She is the fairest in all creation, 
Pretty Peggy, charming creature ; 
Pretty Peggy, darling loved one, 
Ali I 
she's like a 
little bird in the spring.

JOHN MONAHAN'S DONKEY. 
Sung by JAMES BRADLEY, at the Eagle Theatre, with great (success. 
I'vz got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy ; 
He drinks seltzer water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
run on the turf sure he never proved shy ; 
He makes flood time, one mile a 
day, 
I'll match him against any stallion or bay ; 
He fought for his country, been all through the war, 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay, rope and tar. 
CHORUS. 
I 
got a 
donkey, 
lie's not very chunkey, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey 
To any old fltmkey 
Wouldn't that be hunkey 
if he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, 
• 
And donkey also 'I 
When he's locked in his stable he makes a 
stiff kick, 
He wants to get out, he pretends he is sick ; 
I 
call out my donkey, his name it is Dick, 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick ; 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up, leave none for next day ; 
Last week he broke loose and of course went astray, 
lie was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
I 
got a 
donkey, etc. 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
role on his back so cheerful and gay ; 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We got to the hall without any delay ; 
Just as I 
was turning into the park 
Some one fired a 
pistol, just for a 
lark ; 
The donkey fell down which caused a 
blockade, 
Only for fifty horse doctors he'd spoil the parade.

Written and sung by Gus WILLIAms,

THE theatre was full, it was Dorkins' night, 
That is, Dorkius was going to appear 
At night in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny ? why, he'd make you laugh 
Till the tears ran down your face like rain, 
And as long as Dorkins was on the stage 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A 
family ? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he loved them as dear as life, 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one night, 
And I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage 
That he'd trod for so many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly crammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would laugh 
Till their sides would ache, 
And they longed for the curtain to 
The play soon began; 
Each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye 
For Dorkins to make 
His " first entrance," and then 
To give him a 
cheerful " Hi, hi I" 
(

DORKINS' NIGHT.—Concluded. 
He soon appeared 
Amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong 
You could see. 
" 
Dorkins is playing 
Quite badly to-night," 
The people said sitting round me. 
A 
hiss ? yes, it was. 
I 
saw Dorkins start 
As though stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
Then he'd cast a 
beseeching glance all around, 
And his head on his breast would hang. 
He's drunk, and really 
I 
thought so myself. 
For to me it was awful at times 
To see how he'd struggle 
Along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights at last 
He approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
cannot please you to-night, 
The fault's not the heart, 
But the head. 
There's many a 
night 
I've made you all laugh 
'When so ill I 
could scarcely 
Well stand, 
And every effort was pain to me then, 
Yes, if even I 
raised but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, 
And think that I'm drunk 
(From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan) ; 
I'll tell you the reason— 
I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home."

A,0I all Cie day, thronoh heat and cold, I 
pick and dig away, 
And lay the ti ap-blocl Pavement, on a 
street they calls Broad-

At home I 
have a 
family, a 
wife and three big boys, 
They nearly drive me crazy wid their tip-
,htin' and their noise ; 
There's Roger and Fat Mickey and big Dan, that makes the 
three, 
But of all the gang fat Mickey sure he looks the most like me. 
cnonrs. 
Now there's Dan. handsome Dan, 
sure he's the ladies' man ; 
And Roger, he's the divil 
Wid.Ls dancin' and hie noise; 
But of all the boys we've none 
So fond of jolly fun 
Ilickey, darlin' Mickey, 
lie's the best of all the boys. 
He's as broad as he is lengthy, and he weighs two hundred 
poumis, 
At atein' 0-; at slapein sure his like cannot be found; 
At snorin' he's the divil, now believe me Nvhin I 
say, 
You can hear him snore from Tubby Hook across to Dublin 
Bay 
And he can ate his size in mate, or pack the grub below, 
At drinkin' Irish whiskey sure, e- ad. he is not slow : 
When lie comes home a: four o'clock. chock full of old benzine, 
You can bet your bottom dollar then some lively : Hits are 
seen. 
Now there's Dan. etc. 
lie joine.i the " Doherty Fasileers," they put him in the squad. 
He could not hold a 
musket, so they gave 1.1in many a 
prod ; 
He could no: march into the ranks. beka-e he was too fat. 
So says the Irish sarynt. 
Mick, III bounce you out of that!" 
They made him carry the tare: thin and march up in tl.e rear, 
And on the street on Patrick's day you'll see him every year; 
He walks alonc, the bou:evard, so proudly and so gay, 
And whin the girls observe him, sure you'll always hear them 
say 
Now there's Dan, etc. 
FAT MICKEY.— Concluded. 
They say at Philly-del-phia they're going to have a 
fair, 
And all the curiosities they tell me NN• ill be there;

And it' they give a

THE WATERMILL. 
As Recited by Gus IVILLIAms. 
LISTEN to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves ; 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves ; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And the sickle cannot reap corn once gathered ; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep, and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart, and true ; 
Golden years are fleeting by ; youth is passing, too ; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away ; 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last—. 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and 
will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill ; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy—to- day ; 
Power, intellect, and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh ! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by ; 
Oh ! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh ! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing, un, 
heard. 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh ! love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last ; 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the 
past ; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from 
view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the 
good, the true— 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past.

" 
DORKINS WAS TIGHT." 
Written by BENJ. D. 
COLLINS. 
Sung by Gus Wtr.u.kms. 
THE theatre was full, and so were the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night iii a 
bare-footed slack-wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here. 
The bar-room was fearfully crowded with beats 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise ; 
For they knew they would eat 
When the lunch was set out, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah ; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
But they gave him the laugh and yah I 
yak 1 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure ; 
" 
He's away off his base," says John Jas. Mansfield, 
That never went back on the poor. 
A 
brick—well it was—I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark red for two ; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
But continually dropping his cue. 
He says, " rm the king," when a 
woman jumped up 
Cried, " you lie, for you're one of the gang, 
And you owe me for washing." That knocked Dorking 
cold, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
haven't drank enough bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer; 
When me and Jim Stokes walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here. 
You insult me to-night and say I 
am sober, 
For years I've been a 
Hamlet alone; 
I'll tell you the reason, I 
know you will treat, 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead—drunk at home." 
THE APOLOGY TO O'REILLY. 
NOT a 
hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this our glorious Union land, 
Is kept a 
first-class liquor stand 
By a 
man whose name's O'Connor. 
There's a 
man who's known both near and far 
Who attends to Mike O'Connor's bar; 
Who, in our late war received no scar, 
And his name it is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our banner's starry wave, 
There's not a 
man fought half so brave, 
(Jr half the money for whiskey gave, 
As did McDermott. 
O'Connor's bar-room blazed with light 
On that eventful, bloody night 
That McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With sleeves rolled. up McDermott stood, 
And vowed he'd die before he would 
Say the slightest word that could, 
In any manner, be misconstrued 
Into an apology to O'Reilly. 
With a 
frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly collared a 
glass of rye,. 
'Which he devoured without a 
sigh, 
Then turning to McDermott, said, 
" 
You alchoholic vat, you drunken loon ! 
You've no more sense than a 
gossoon !" 
"Be Heavens ! 
I'll make you change your tune," 
Says McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till o'er his eye a 
shanty rose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
With his head jammed in a 
big spittoon, 
And dreaming of Barnum's big balloon, 
The police came in and collared the gang.
