Jason Woodcock (b. 1976, Somerset, KY) has been a full-time rural mail carrier for 16 years, and has 
worked for the Postal Service for a total of 23 years. His father had worked as a substitute rural carrier 
when Woodcock was a child. Woodcock works out of the Dunville, KY Post Office, serving primarily 
Casey County, as well as Adair and Russell Counties on a 115 mile route with 560 boxes. Some of his 
customers are members of the Amish and Mennonite communities. Woodcock now drives a US Postal 
Service-assigned Mercedes Metris van. In this interview, he talks about delivering mail to Amish 
customers during the solar eclipse, gifts he’s received from customers, the new RRECS system, wildlife 
sightings and encounters along his route, what he listens to while delivering mail, and the future of the 
rural craft. He also recounts a high speed chase he once went on during his route, with his postmaster in 
tow.  
I met Jason at the 2022 winter meeting of the Kentucky Rural Letter Carriers Association. We talked in a 
quiet corner of the lobby in the hotel where the meeting was being held.

EH: Okay, so it is February 5th, 2022. We're in Somerset, Kentucky. Why don't you introduce yourself, 
tell me your name, where you're from and the year you were born?  
 
JW: Name's Jason Woodcock. I was born here in Somerset, Kentucky. What was the other question? 
 
EH: Year you were born 
 
JW: Oh 1976! [redacted] 
 
EH: So tell me how you first got interested in becoming a rural mail carrier. 
 
JW: Of course, seeing the mailman come every day, you know, you're kinda interested in that. And then 
my dad got on as a sub when I was 7, 8, 9--somewhere in that age. And you know seeing him do that and 
then actually what really first piqued my interest was we had some blizzards here when I was in high 
school. And back then, the postal service would let you have a driver. Now you can't. So I got to drive my 
dad on the route while he stuffed boxes. So that's what really kind of piqued my interest. 
 
EH: And that was fun? (laughs) 
 
JW: Sure! I mean, it was different. It was something cool to do, you know. 
 
EH: Did he have a right side drive car? 
 
JW: No, he was carrying in an extended cab pickup, 2-wheel drive and all we did, we would put chains 
when it was really bad and then studded snow tires with weight in the backend is really all you kinda did 
back then. For us. 
 
EH: And he was able to fit all of the mail in the pickup? 
 
JW: Yeah, of course this was 30 years ago. Parcel volume wasn't as much. It was more letters and 
magazines and that kind of stuff. And a lot more fits inside a vehicle in that--of course we did have a 
toolbox in the back end that we could put stuff in to keep dry for extra stuff, but as not as many parcels, 
you don't have to have as much room. 
 
EH: Right. Yeah, so tell me about the community that you serve these days? 
 
JW: I work out of Dunville, Kentucky. It's the gate capital of the world. Tarter Gate makes farm gates 
there so it's known as the gate capital of the world. Its 115 mile-long. I primarily serve Casey County, but 
I do part of Russell and Adair also. And it's very rural. It's got a mixture of Amish, Mennonite, and just 
ordinary country folk on it. 
 
EH: So a lot of farmers probably?

JW: A lot of farmers, yep, sure do. 
 
EH: How many boxes are on your route? 
 
JW: I got 560 boxes right now. 
 
EH: That's a lot. 
 
JW: It is! When you drive 115 miles and 560 boxes, it takes all day. 
 
EH: Yeah, so how many hours does that take you? 
 
JW: Normally clock in at 7:30 in the morning and average time out is somewhere between 3 and 4 in the 
afternoon. 
 
EH: Why don't you walk me through your day from when you get to the post office to when you get back 
home. 
 
JW: I get to the post office at 7:30 and that's when the mail truck is supposed to arrive. My office is 
unique. Most offices when the carrier-clerk's in, or clocks in, there is mail already worked ready for them 
to work. Well, it's supposed to be that way in my office, but it's not. It's when the truck gets there, we 
kinda all dig in. And it's just me and another person and start working the mail, as soon as the mail truck 
gets there and normally anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half, I have the letters cased and the flats 
cased and the parcels marked. Pull it all down, get ready to load it in the vehicle. Usually somewhere 
around 9, something or other like that. And then set out on the route. I take, actually my route's mostly I 
can divide it in half. I do a lot of circles so I've got a big circle on the first part, and I come right back by 
the post office at lunchtime essentially, so I'm able to stop and have a bathroom spot and load up and talk 
to whoever's there, see if they've got any questions and then about 3 hours on the 2nd half and then done 
and ready to go to the house. 
 
EH: Nice. What kind of vehicle do you drive? 
 
JW: Currently drive a Mercedes Metris van. Postal Service put a van on me. It's okay. It will not go in the 
snow. But before that I drove Geo Trackers and then a Toyota Prius, believe it or not. 
 
EH: And how was that in the snow? 
 
JW: Oh it don't go in the snow either. It goes better than the Metris, though, believe it or not! 
 
EH: Oh really? Wow. 
 
JW: Well, the Prius is front-wheel drive so we could put studded snow tires on and go a little bit. But if it 
snows even know, I have a '97 Honda CRV all-wheel drive that I have it studded snow tires on, and I can 
go when other people can't. 
 
EH: I see. So why did the post office have you switch from using your own vehicle to using this 
Mercedes? 
 
JW: It's an agreement between the Postal Service and the union. The Postal Service is supposed to be 
putting more vehicles out on routes. And they figured because I had 115 mile-long route, see what they do 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard

with most carriers is reimburse. They pay them mileage--EMA, which is currently 87.5 cents a mile. So if 
you figure that times 115 miles, that's 90-some dollars a day. So they either pay that to me to reimburse 
me or they figure that that is actually cheaper to put their own vehicle on my route now but now they're 
responsible for all keep-up. Up-keep. I don't have to do anything to it. They buy the gas, they do it all. 
They come out and fit flat tires, they do it ALL. So I guess that's the reason they did. But it won't go in 
the snow (laughs). 
 
06:28  
 
EH: Do you prefer that arrangement? 
 
JW: It took a lot of getting used to for me because I worked out of a 3-bundle system at the time and I 
straddled the seats. I sat in the middle of my delivery vehicles, my personal, so I would have mail all 
around me. Now I sit on the right hand and all my mail is on the left. So it took a little bit of getting used 
to. But I was starting to have some, you know, I've been carrying that route 16 years full-time, subbed 7 
or 8 years and I was starting to have some physical problems. My lower back because I was having to 
reach quite a bit. That has helped with that some. So that is one plus in getting the van put on me. 
 
EH: Is it comfortable to sit in? I talked to someone who is driving an LLV and they were just talking, 
complaining about kind of it's not designed for people. Is it a comfortable vehicle for you? Is there a 
radio? 
 
JW: Yeah! It's actually really comfortable. I mean, it ain't got leather seats and a seat warmer or nothing 
like that, but it's comfortable. It's got a nice radio in it. It's got heat and air in it, where a lot of the old 
LLVs don't. It's kind of a hybrid-type vehicle. If you're sitting still for very long, the air conditioner kicks 
off essentially. So it does get hot but then as soon as you move, it'll freeze you out of it. So it's kinda up 
down, up down in the heat and cold. But overall it's pretty comfortable. 
 
EH: Tell me about your customers and those you've gotten to know over the years? 
 
JW: Have a lot of, I have a mixture. There's a wide mixture of customers on my route. Like I said, 
anywhere from the Amish who are the old-school that have the beards and the horse and buggy and no 
rubber tires or anything like that. And you know, I love those people for the most part. The kids--it's fun, 
they all, well the whole family lives for the mailman! Because that's what they revolve around. They don't 
have TV, they don't have internet, they don't have phones for the most part, cell phones, so you know, 
they write letters. And they wait for the mail to come every day. And the kids run out to the mailbox and 
get the mail and run it back to their parents.  
 
And a funny store with that, I had a family on my route, this eclipse, total eclipse that happened 3 or 4 
years ago now. I, the Post Office provided us with glasses so that we wouldn't get our eyes hurt or 
whatever. So I happened to get to their house roughly when it was at its peak and I happened to notice 
they were all standing out in the yard, and they were trying to look up at it! So I just put the vehicle in 
part and I said, "Hey guys, check these out!" (laughs) And it was cool to watch them all take it and share 
it, you know, put them glasses on and look up and it was really cool. And it was cool for me to give them 
that experience, you know, because they weren't able to get it any other way. They was having to shade 
their eyes and try to you know, glare, and do all that. But you know, I try to provide them a service and in 
turn, they get to know me and they...they do home baked goods pretty good! (laughs) So there's treats in 
the mailbox. I'll get fresh fruit, fresh food, you know, they took good care of their mailman for the most 
part. And then you know, I have the Mennonite family that is more liberal, I guess you would say, and 
they're kinda the same way, but one thing, they do a more mail volume because they run businesses a lot

of time. And they're not hardly, they're friendly but they don't get to know the mailman like the old school 
Amish do. They're a little busier, they're a little more distracted. So they do still rely on the mail pretty 
heavily. But, I mean they're still good people. And then you just got average country folks out there that 
are just like anybody else. All walks of life. I've got business owners, like I said, the people that own 
Tarter Gate in Dunnville, the gate capital of the world, are on my mail route. It's--we are a little bitty 
office. We have one route, one clerk, 6 hours, there's a gas station beside us. But it's a hub of essentially 
worldwide business. There's tractor trailers, there's gates, there's deliveries. There's goods coming in, 
goods coming out. And those people have really helped keep that little Dunnville Post Office going. So, I 
don't know, trying to think of other customers--you got any other questions while I'm thinking? 
 
EH: Oh yeah! (laughs) Yeah, tell me a little bit more about the food and the things that customers leave 
for you. 
 
JW: It's a wide variety. Fresh sausage, in rolls. Like I said, strawberries, watermelon, and cantaloupes--
and this is all seasonal, you know, it's whatever's in at the time. And well this past Christmas there was 
fresh homemade bread, just come out of the oven, still warm because they timed, because I'm pretty 
consistent, so they timed it. There's always chocolate chip cookies and a lot of, like I said, homemade, not 
bought stuff that come from a lot of those customers out there. Cinnamon rolls, it's a wide variety. I do 
have, I'll tell you, I thought of one customer. Her name is Wanda Conatser. I used to go to church with her 
a little bit. She's an elderly lady, she's probably 75 now. So I've known her for almost 20 years. She's 
kinda adopted me as a son. She is the one customer that takes care of me no matter whether it's cold or hot 
or whatever. 
 
13:21  
 
If it's hot, I've got cold drinks in the mailbox, cookies and stuff, snacks along the way, and then when it's 
cold I've got warm food or a warm drink or whatever. She is, she gets extra service too, I wanna tell you! 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
JW: I take care of her mail! (laughs) She takes care of me, her stuff gets taken care of better (laughs). But 
she is a special lady and I think a lot of her out there. So, and those kind of connections make--you know, 
this is a job. But those kind of connections make the job a little better along the way.  
 
EH: That's very cool. And you're so consistent that she can leave a hot drink in the mailbox? 
 
JW: Well, I mean it's, most days. There's some--it all depends on when the mail truck gets there, really. 
Because it takes me about the same amount of time if the mail will get there on time. But most of the 
time, I'm within a 30-minute window, you know. There will be days when I'm not, when the weather's 
really bad or something, but most of the time I'm within a 30-minute window-ish in there. So it might not 
be hot, hot. But it's still warm. (laughs) 
 
EH: I read a book of oral histories about carrying the mail in rural Virginia and there was one story of this 
mail carrier was so consistent that one day they got to the box and there was fresh homemade ice cream. 
You know, it was sitting on--the bowl was on ice--but it was in the mailbox and still frozen. 
 
JW: I'm not hardly that consistent! You could put ice cream in there right now, it'd be alright! But 
(laughs) 
 
EH: I think this was a summer day.

JW: Yeah, I don't...now I have had them stop me and be like, "Hey, can you wait a minute?" And I'm like 
sure, whatever! (laughs) I'll wait for your food.  
 
EH: Yeah, what's the importance of that service for the community? 
 
15:25  
 
JW: Well I mean, especially, we can see this in the mail volume and mail stream. Anybody my age, 
which I'm 46 today, and younger, a lot of 'em are using internet and stuff more to handle their business. 
But from my age on up, everybody has relied on the Postal Service for the most part. You know, my 
parents are 66, I think. Somewhere in there. They still don't, they wouldn't pay a bill online for it! You 
know, they're gonna put a stamp on it and they're gonna mail it off. So, you know, the age makes a 
difference, and when you're out in a rural community like I am, that is a big part of your customer base. 
You know, young people tend to go more towards the city and you know, a little quicker, or have a PO 
box and come pick it up because they want it quicker! They can't wait for the mail to come! But the 
majority of the customers out there, my age and older really rely on the Postal Service. Like I said, I've 
got 4 or 5 home businesses that work out of their home, they wait for me to bring them supplies and then 
they mail their product out in the end. And you know, I got real estate agents, I got, a little bit of 
everything--saw mills, all that kinda stuff and everybody kind of relies on that to wait for us to bring them 
their checks. You know? Checks are important! (laughs) 
 
EH: Definitely! How have you seen your job change over time? 
 
JW: So 16 years full-time, 23 or so total with the Postal Service. When I started, there was no such thing 
as a scanner. So it was just deliver the mail. You didn't have to worry about scanning a package, delivered 
or whatever. Soon after that, the first generation of scanners came out, and it was more about 
remembering. They didn't have a whole lot of delivery confirmation bar codes at the time, but they were 
just starting to track those in the early days, so it was make sure you get that stuff done so that we know. 
And you know, when I first started out, letters, man. The letter volume was, I mean 4 or 5 times or more 
what it is now. I can remember on the route I am now, just 15-16 years ago, getting anywhere from 6-10 
foot a day of raw letters! Which a raw letter, you've got to stand at the case and you've got to case your 
letters. Well, now it switched over to Delivery Point Sequence, so most of that, and most days I will get 
anywhere from 3-5 or 6 feet of letters now. So that went anywhere from 6-10 to I'm down to 3-5 on an 
average day. But it comes in the Delivery Point Sequence so I don't have to do anything. Post Office does 
that, it's already in order. So my raw letter volume has gone to an inch or two compared to what it used to 
be! Flats were the same way. Everybody used to get a newspaper. Everybody! And it's still that way in the 
local towns, like my Casey County News and the Adair Progress and stuff like that. A lot of those people 
out there still get those. There is no Lexington Herald, there is no Louisville Courier Journal. Nobody 
gets those papers anymore. So you know, newspapers are a huge way that it has changed. The other 
magazine flats, we used to get all kinds of advertisement magazines, you know, seed magazines, people 
wanting you to buy everything! Sears catalogs, JC Penny catalogs--everybody used to wait on those at 
Christmas! And they don't come anymore! You know, you get a little one maybe that has like a, you 
know, it's maybe half an inch thick and real loose. It's easy to handle where the old catalogs were 3-inches 
thick and everybody out there got one! (laughs) Phone books! Everybody used to get a phone book! 
That's not that way anymore. We still have phonebook day where part of the route, some of 'em get 'em 
and some of 'em don't. But it used to be, if I had 560 phone books, there was 650 phone books because 
some people had two! Now you might get 200 phone books, because a lot of people don't get phone 
books. And then parcel volume. It used to, it wasn't as many packages and now especially since COVID 
hit, everybody buys online, their medicine is shipped online, everything is online and it's up to us to make 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Jason Woodcock – 2/5/22

sure it gets there. And that's the way I feel about my job. When I took it on and not, I'm sure every carrier 
don't feel this way, but if they get the mail to me, if I can get it safely to my customers, I'm gonna do 
everything I can to try to get it there, whether it's you know, like I said, I've got my own vehicle that I 
don't technically have to provide, but I want to get it to my customers. They might need that medicine, 
they might need something. Now their letter mail and their magazines and stuff can wait if it has to. But I 
feel like you know, as much medicine as comes anymore, it's imperative for me to get out there and get it 
done. 
 
EH: Right. 
 
JW: Yeah. 
 
EH: And especially, as you said, it's an older population as well. 
 
JW: Yep. Well, and like I said, my mom and dad are older, they, you see their lives change. So you know, 
even as a carrier, I've seen, it used to be a medicine bag or two that would come in. Now it's multiple bags 
of medicine that especially since the VA started shipping through the mail. I mean it's, there's just bags of 
medicine, bags of medicine, bags of medicine. So.  
 
EH: Yeah. There was a big discussion today about scanners. Could you talk a little bit more about how 
that has changed your work and you know, being able to being monitored all the time, essentially? 
 
JW: Well, we just had a conversation, me and a couple other people did about customer service. One of 
the big things with scanners is, you're constantly monitored. They know how fast you're going, they know 
where you're going, they know how long you've been there. They know if you back up. They know it all! 
And you know, they currently have a program that if you're there more than 10 minutes, they can ask you 
why you've been sitting still for more than 10 minutes. Well, maybe I'm having a mail conversation to a 
customer, trying to help them with something out. Maybe it's just a friend, you know, or something 
happened, or--there's no way for them to really know why because that scanner may know we're sitting 
still, but they haven't got an aerial view of real time, knowing what's going on out there. And the scanner's 
a good thing and a bad thing. We're able to better serve our customers because when we scan something, 
they know it's at the Post Office, it's "arrived at facility." When we take it out on the route, and scan it as 
delivered, we scan it as delivered at the front door or other location or garage. They know where to go 
look for it. So they know where their mail's at when it comes to that stuff. But it's also, you know, it's like 
having big brother riding with you! The whole time. And the biggest problem is, they don't, like I said, 
they don't know exactly why we do what we do out there. And there's no doubt bad carriers just like, you 
know there's 80 thousand rural carriers. Not all of 'em are doing the job correctly! I don't do it all the time 
correctly because nobody really can.  
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
JW: And it's just...it's hard to deal with but it's a good thing at the same time. I think the new system, this 
new RRECS, R-R-E-C-S, new RREC system is supposed to be a more fair evaluation of our time because 
it's gonna time everything we do. And both parties have agreed to that--the union and the Postal Service. 
It's still gonna be a work in progress as you've heard today. None of us know all the details even, and 
that's kinda why, you know, starting in July, is when our paychecks are gonna be affected, so we're all on 
edge a little bit because we need to know the details to make sure we're doing things correctly, to make 
sure the data's being captured correctly, and applying it to the routes and making sure it's all right! And 
COVID, the last 2 years has thrown all that into, because not only they couldn't meet to get the stuff down 
pat, but supervisors couldn't do that and other things and then there was short staffed everywhere. So it, 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Jason Woodcock – 2/5/22

the last 2 years has just been survive. Survival mode. It's been everybody pitching in for the most part. 
You know, I've worked a lot of my day's off because either the sub was sick or the sub had to go work 
another route because that guy was sick! So you know, that's been happening everywhere across the 
nation. 
 
25:36  
 
EH: Does it seem like most people stand to, for their pay to go down with this new system, or are there 
cases it'll go up? 
 
JW: I think both. My route in particular I think's gonna go down because I do a lot of driving and the 
more driving you do under the old versus the new system, that is gonna decrease your route time. We 
were counted as 12 minutes a mile drive time for the other, average through the week. Now it's, they're 
measuring it by feet. So 15 feet is .6 mile an hour or .5 mile an hour or whatever. 5,000 feet's 40 mile an 
hour. So it's gonna be measured by--and nobody really knows exactly--that's what they say, but we know 
what the old system is but we don't know the new. Now I do have a buddy, he has a high-density route, so 
it's 30 or 40 miles, but he's got 700 or 800 boxes. So he's probably gonna gain because his route, he wasn't 
able to drive that mile as quick as I was and can't. So his route, those kinda routes are probably gonna get 
bigger! And they probably should! You know, I used to carry on a route like that that had 35 miles but 
had 100, you know, would have a bunch of boxes here and there and doctors on it and they all would get 
6 inches of mail a piece and 5 boxes a piece and you know, it takes a lot longer to serve them than it does 
me 10 boxes that get 15-20 letters.  
 
EH: Mmhm. 
 
JW: So both routes, I think I heard a figure that they're expecting 65% of the routes to either go up or 
down. They didn't say which way, but...so that's a big chunk! A big percentage! 
 
EH: Yeah. What are some instances in your work where you have had to stop for you know, 10 minutes 
or longer, aside from the eclipse? 
 
JW: Well, I've had cows out. Now I don't know that it's 10 minutes or longer--I don't time it. 
 
EH: Yeah, yeah. 
 
JW: But of course out in the country you have cows out, and I try to stop and help if I can or even, I'll 
deviate and go find the owner and tell them their cows are out! I've had breakdowns in my old vehicle. As 
a new carrier, you don't have a lot of money so you just bought a cheap vehicle to try to get you around, 
well then you have a flat tire or you have, who knows what happens! So there's multiple times I've been 
sitting still for that. Now, like I said, the Postal Service, if I break down in the van, all I do is call them 
and they come get it. But one, I will tell you one story about something that happened on the route. They 
do what they call inspections where your supervisor or postmaster or whatever would ride along with you 
in the back seat and he would inspect your route. Check and make sure you got the number of boxes, the 
number of miles, all that kinda stuff. He happened to be riding with me this day in my Toyota Prius and 
we was getting about 3/4ths the way done through the route and I got a text from Sherriff's Deputy that's 
also a friend from Dunville there and said my sub's son had been kidnapped! And to watch out for this 
vehicle. Her mail vehicle. He took her son and her mail vehicle. So we're trying to figure out what's going 
on, me and my boss, while delivering the mail, and about a mile down the road, here they come! And I'm 
like--that's her vehicle! And so this, the supervisor probably wouldn't tell you to do this normally but he's 
like, "Chase that guy!" (laughs)

EH: (laughs) 
 
JW: So we, of course, I'm sitting in the middle, driving with my left hand and my left foot and he's in the 
back and we're flying down these country roads, 70, 80 mile an hour, doing curves, trying to catch this 
guy. Trying to follow him and we forgot, I mean we eventually got back to the mail route, but it was, you 
know, it's kinda weird--of course that's not gonna happen very, ever, often, to have your supervisor in the 
back seat and then going 80 mile an hour on these little country roads trying to catch a kidnapper that 
ended up--he got away from the local authorities, ran through fences on the way, and they finally caught 
him about, well it was in Stanford, which is about 35 miles from here north and he had run through creeks 
and all kinds of stuff. He was wanted for murder in Missouri and how--it was just a miracle from God that 
he did not harm that boy. So I mean it is crazy, it all worked out, you know, her mail vehicle was totaled 
and they caught the guy, but he was super dangerous, and that...I mean if I never have that happen again, 
awesome! But it's a story that gets told about me, chasing down a bad guy in a Toyota Prius with my boss 
in the back, all the time! 
 
EH: Wow! That's amazing! 
 
JW: Yeah. 
 
EH: So did your boss call the cops while you were... 
 
JW: Yeah, he was on the phone with the cops while I was trying to drive and concentrate and relay 
information to him about where we were, you know, all that kinds of stuff. Of course out there in the 
country you don't have real good service so you might be on the phone one second and it dropped and 
then you gotta call back and then whatever so it was, it was surreal. 
 
EH: Wow! So did the cops end up joining in or finding him because of that? 
 
JW: They were chasing him before hand, is the reason--and he'd went a back road and come up on my 
mail route, and then was headed the other way. There was not a cop around at the time. They were trying 
to figure out where he was so we were relaying and he eventually got away from us. We couldn't track 
him anymore but you know, we gave him an area, but he still got all the way through Somerset headed 
north to Stanford before they finally caught up to him up there. I mean and if they hadn't have, there's no 
telling what would have happened to that boy. 
 
EH: Yeah, wow. That's amazing. 
 
JW: Yeah, it was--I'll never forget it. 
 
EH: Well that was sort of another question: What are the stories that when you get together with other 
carriers, you tell to each other? And also any jokes or anything like that? 
 
JW: (sighs) I mean there's really--I don't know. In my little office, you know, I know other carriers but we 
don't, there's no real, I don't have a comradery or whatever because there's no other carriers around me. 
Now I know 'em and I talk to 'em but there's no like morning joking around or any of that kind of stuff. 
Now you hear the stories of the dogs chasing you back and I don't get out on one out anymore just 'cause I 
don't want to--Post Office says if I get bit, it's my problem! (laughs)

EH: Wow.  
 
JW: I shouldn't have got out. Now, they'll still have to do stuff, but they don't like it. But you know, I 
don't have a--that's one thing--it's good and bad. I don't have to put up with people, but I don't have that 
office joking and you know all that kinda stuff. But you know, stories, besides driving through the snow 
and seeing weird things and I can't remember them all right now, but you see things out there, like 
animals at certain places. You know, I've seen doors open and goats run out of the house. You know, it's 
like, whatever. (laughs) 
 
EH: Yeah, right! (laughs) What about wildlife, animals, strange encounters on the route? 
 
JW: Have quite a few of them. Lots of deer, lots of turkey, lots of rabbits. And had to dodge 'em, had to 
stop for 'em, had to do it all. Have started seeing eagles on the route, which the last couple years has been 
pretty cool!  
 
EH: Bald eagles? 
 
JW: Bald, eagles, yes! Course you know, they're becoming more populous again, because they've tried to 
make them that way, but I live, I mean the route is part on the Green River. And of course it's a good 
habitat for wildlife and they really, the eagles have really kinda moved in there. I think I've got two pair 
on the route now. But seeing them for the first time, you know, and one of 'em was, the pair was right 
beside the road, catching some prey the first time I saw them. So there was one close and one about 75 
yards away, so that was really cool to see them. And then one time, I was driving my Suzuki Sidekick, 
which is a little 4-door SUV, and I was driving down the road, had the driver's side window up, passenger 
side window down, so it was a little bit cool but not cold. And I see these bunch of turkeys in the field, 
and they were in the field so I wasn't caring too much about them and I was just driving on and they 
started coming towards the road, and right as I got to the road, they started to talk off and fly over the 
road, and one of 'em was coming right towards my open window. And when he got right to the window, 
he just went right over the roof, I mean barely over the roof of the vehicle. Well, I was already trying to 
figure out how to get out of my vehicle when he got in there, because he was gonna win that fight!  
 
EH: Oh yeah. 
 
JW: I wasn't gonna fight him. I was gonna let him do it, but I was hoping I could have put it in drive 
quick enough to get out before he hurt me because that was going to be one mess right there. I know he 
would have whooped me. I can still see it to that day, that turkey going "phew!" (makes flying sound) 
right over the top of the vehicle. Haven't seen any bear yet, but they're coming more and more. Sheep in 
the road, I mean I've had to, flocks of sheep, a lot of the Amish have sheep and they get in the road and 
you just got to kinda mosey them along, get out of the way, horses--there's a little bit of everything. But 
that's one thing I do like about the route. I've got lots of wildlife to look at, lots of fields with different 
crops, you know, in the spring and summer and fall, and I would rather be doing that than looking at 
blacktop any day.  
 
EH: Yeah, for sure. Yeah, what about other changes besides like more wildlife or more eagles? Are there 
changes in the landscape along the route since you've done it? 
 
JW: Not a great, not a great deal. It's mostly cropland. You know, there's Tarter's also has a sawmill 
besides their gate factory. I mean you get logging but they've been doing that for a long time. Now they're 
doing it on a bigger scale probably now than what they used to. So when they go into log a woods, if 
they're taking most of it out, you know, it looks pretty bare. But as for the most part on my route, it's 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Jason Woodcock – 2/5/22

pretty much stayed the same. We get a few more houses being built up where a field used to be, but for 
the most part, crops, and that's the way it is. And that's good. I like it. 
 
EH: Yeah. Not too much development? 
 
JW: Not a whole lot of development. I am getting some people moving in from out of state, different 
states because well I mean, just Kentucky is a more conservative state, and they're not wanting to deal 
with the taxes and stuff and they're buying 2 and 3, 4 acre tracts of land and they're putting a trailer on it. 
A lot of it's land that wasn't being used for crops anyway, but was just kind of sitting vacant, people was 
mowing it off, so they, you know, they're buying this up and moving in. Now they're, I see them just like 
the people that are down here already, because that's kind of what they're wanting to move into. You 
know, they're wanting to leave that up there and move into here. But other than that, not a whole lot of 
change. 
 
38:39  
 
EH: What do you do on your route--do you listen to the radio, do you listen to books on tape? 
 
JW: I'm a sports guy, so I do have a routine. I've listened to mainly a country radio station for about the 
first hour of the route, then I have a sports talk show that comes on--Kentucky Sports Radio that I listen to 
from 10-12 every day. 
 
EH: Is that Matt Jones [radio host]? 
 
JW: That's Matt Jones. Yeah. And then from then on, I do a lot of podcasts over a wide variety of topics, 
anywhere from about church, religion to "Stuff You Should Know," to a lot of true crime. Stuff to occupy 
because if you listen to the radio, if you listen to it long enough, and if you listen to it every day, you're 
gonna hear the same stuff every day. So I try to do other, you know, like the sports talk, it's a different 
topic every day. The country show, Bobby Bones--I listen to him in the mornings for about an hour. 
 
EH: What's the station down here--the country station? 
 
JW: 93.9 
 
EH: It's not The Wagon is it? 
 
JW: No.  
 
EH: Okay. 
 
JW: I don't even know what it's called. But anyway, I listen to it. Bobby Bones out of Nashville is on. So I 
listen to him from about 9-10 and then 10-12 is the sports radio, and then from 12 on, 12-3 or 4, whenever 
I get done is podcasts. So you do that 5 times a week, that's 20 hours’ worth of podcasts, you listen to a 
lot of different podcasts. And you run out of them! (laughs) So you gotta have something to pass your 
time out there. I haven't went to the books on tape yet. I just, I'm not a big book reader anyway, so I 
haven't ventured into that. Now I've still got minimum of 11 years to retirement, so ask me in 11 years if 
I've went down that road because I've run out of other stuff! 
 
EH: Yeah, right. Well, you could get into some true crime novels, or not novels, but you know non-
fiction, or crime novels maybe.

Interview with Jason Woodcock – 2/5/22

JW: Maybe. But I don't know. I don't even like the--I'm getting to the point...I like the ones, the serial 
ones that are multiple in a series or whatever. I will listen to some of those that have each individual 
shows, but some of those even get monotonous to me because a lot of them all cover the same thing. 
Same crimes. So I like the ones that kinda tell a story, so I might like a book, but I don't know if I can 
devote that much time and that much focus. That's the good thing about a podcast is if you got a customer 
talking to you or if you're having to concentrate on the mail for a little bit, if you miss something, you can 
get the gist in a minute or two, what's going on. A book, if you miss something important, you might not 
even know what's going on shortly! 
 
EH: Yeah, for books on tape, I need to do something with a lot of plot, so like mystery or crime. It's hard 
to, if it's very literary it's hard to listen to. 
 
JW: Yeah, I can imagine so. 
 
EH: Hard to follow. 
 
41:48  
 
JW: Yeah, yeah. 
 
EH: Let's see, what else do I have her for questions. What's the maybe most unusual thing you've ever 
delivered? 
 
JW: I deliver queen bees. I deliver wax worms, worms.  
 
EH: And what's that used for--fishing? Feed? 
 
JW: A lot of it's feed for other insects or animals, you know, or I'm sure some of it's for fishing. I don't 
really--I don't ask questions, for the most part! (laughs) Deliver a lot of chickens, especially baby 
chickens, because of the Amish and Mennonites and stuff. Delivered roosters and that kinda stuff. 
Delivered other fowl of some kind or another, not real sure--ducks and stuff. Had a lady that shipped a lot 
of fertile eggs out so she would get eggs packaged up and I'd handle them. I don't know--I've delivered 
whole hives of bees besides just a queen bee. Now those are interesting because especially, they don't 
allow them to come in the winter, but sometimes they do come when it's cool. So they'll come off that 
truck and they're not moving at all. And the longer they sit in the post office, and the longer they start 
buzzing more and more and they start moving around more and more and they start making a lot of noise, 
but you know, for the most part they're staying in that thing, they're not getting out. But it is, you always 
worry. You hear like zzzzzz (makes buzzing sound). If that bunch gets out, I'm in trouble! 
 
EH: Yeah, right. Wow. 
 
JW: I don't think there's a whole lot other. Who knows what's in some of the boxes. 
 
EH: Yeah, right. 
 
JW: (laughs) 
 
EH: Oh I had a question and it just went out of my mind. Do you find that you learn about people by 
delivering the mail? (laughs)

Interview with Jason Woodcock – 2/5/22

JW: More than you should know, in a lot of instances! You know what mail looks like. You know what 
overdraft notices look like, you know what black covers mean, you know...and you know what people, I 
mean a lot of people's political beliefs--you find that out. Religious beliefs, depending on the mail that 
they get and how consistently it comes and I mean you get to--each customer's different and you get to 
know what, I mean a lot of what they're doing in their private life, sometimes! And it's, you know I've 
always, when weird stuff comes in, I say it's my job to deliver the mail and not ask questions. So I just 
deliver the mail! 
 
EH: Probably for the best! 
 
JW: Yeah, a lot of it is too much information! (laughs) 
 
EH: (laughs) What do you generally wear on the job and do you bring stuff along for inclement weather 
or anything? 
 
JW: I've got a coat at the post office that I bought, I don't know, 12 years ago. It's a lightweight coat, but 
it's really, really warm, cost me about 15 bucks. It hangs at the post office all year long. I will take it 
home at the end of the cold and wash it and I'll take it back and hang it back up. And that's all it leaves the 
post office. I put a zipper in it, but it's the best coat in the world. It doesn't let air in, it was cheap, and I 
love it! But I do have like, I wear insulated pants on the day it's really, really cold. But most of the time 
it's just pants and a long sleeve shirt and that coat. Or if it's not as cold a sweatshirt. And then the next 
step is, I love shorts. I wear shorts as long as possible. So shorts and a T-shirt, or shorts and a T-shirt and 
a sweatshirt. That's the general--I'm not required to wear a uniform, even though I've developed my own 
uniform and I'm sure some of my customers have probably figured this out by now, but I have a lot of, I 
have about 5 shirts that are the same shirt, they're just different colors. I wear one on Monday, one on 
Tuesday, one of Wednesday, one on Thursday, and one on Friday in the same color the same day. 
 
EH: Oh wow. 
 
JW: Just because. It's simple, I don't have to think about it. Now they're about to get wore out. They might 
have a year, maybe 2 left in 'em so I'm gonna have to figure something else out. 
 
EH: So what's the color for each day? 
 
JW: Monday is blue. Tuesday is green. Wednesday--what color is Wednesday? Thursday is, I have 
another different color green. I can't remember the Wednesday color. It's been a while since summer! 
(laughs) It's in the closet is all I know. Man, I can't think. And then Friday sometimes I will switch it up 
but I've got a different blue shirt. Different color of blue. But yeah, it's, I used to when I first started out, 
thought I had to wear something different every day and something all this, and I finally, the one thing the 
mail does is it will get your clothes nasty. All the ink that comes off of it. So I don't wear good stuff. I 
mean I look decent, but I don't wear good stuff and I've just got to where I buy cheap T-shirts and that's 
what I wear. Because the customers don't care. The animals don't care. The mail don't care. Nobody 
cares! So I don't have to worry about it! 
 
EH: Nice. Seems like a good plan, good approach. Just one or two more things. What do you like the 
most about your job?

JW: I'm kinda my own boss. You know, when I'm out there, I've got a time set that I need to be done by, 
but if I need to stop and help somebody do something I can. If I need to take care of some business or talk 
to a friend or do whatever, you know, I like that part. And then the other part is the people. The 
customers--developing the relationships. You know, some you don't like (laughs). Most you do, some you 
don't. And some that you didn't like to begin with develop into people that you like! Because you know, 
they see what you do, and you see what they do and eventually you come to an understanding and you get 
along. But yeah, it's the people and the freedom. I mean I like the job for the most part.  
 
EH: Where do you see the future of the craft of rural mail carrying going? 
 
JW: Man, that (sighs)--that subject's a little bit loaded because really you saw it before COVID morphing 
a little bit away from the letters and stuff like that. Since COVID you know, it's parcel heavy and people 
rely on you a little bit more now. You know, I think they've come to appreciate maybe a little bit more. 
But I'm not real sure. A lot of, for my route in particular, a lot of people like the old way still. So maybe 
my route versus a city route won't be as affected as much by technology and all that kind of stuff. Now 
there's no doubt parcel heavy, parcel volume is going to continue to be heavier and heavier and heavier, I 
would think, as people get more used to buying online. And as we see, more stores are shutting down. So 
the option is, you have to buy online for the most part. I mean you look at this city right here. Stores have 
shut down. You can't--I went to the candy aisle at Walmart this afternoon. I like hard candy out on the 
mail route. It's bare! So I had to look on Amazon to look and see if I could find what I wanted! So you 
know, all that kinda stuff is changing, and I don't think anybody really knows. Once, give us 2 or 3 years 
out of COVID, out of this pandemic, and how society morphs into what it's gonna be post-pandemic, 
because this is an event like the Spanish Flu, like World Wars, society's changing and will never be like it 
was 2 years ago. So we really don't know, I don't think. 
 
EH: Yeah, yeah. Well is there anything else we didn't talk about or that you'd like to share? 
 
JW: Post office is a good place to work for the most part, if you like talking to people and dealing with 
people. It's provided for my family and it's got me to places I never thought I could be growing up, you 
know. It's--a appreciate it for that. I appreciate for the people I've met along the way. Made a lot of good 
friends in it. Hope to make a lot more. But that's about it! I enjoy my time. 
 
EH: Thank you so much! 
 
JW: Alrighty. 
 
EH: That was great. 
 
JW: Thank you.
