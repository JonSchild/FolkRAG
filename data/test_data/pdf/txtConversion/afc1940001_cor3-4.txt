Mr. Edward N. WatersMusic DivisionLibrary of CongressWashington, D.C.Dear Mr. Waters:
Thank you very much for your letter saying the famous 10 disks are on their way back to me. I am
setting up the duplicating apparatus this week for the first time since last November; good team
work, I calls it.
I enclose the receipt for $5.23 I paid the express company here for the last 50 blanks sent us from
New York. If you can collect this for me I would appreciate it. I enclose also my receipt for these
blanks, which represent the last installment on the first 200 pledged us.
My office has moved to the Music Department at the University of California, since our Federal funds
have expired. Their renewal will, we expect, be coming along but it may take some weeks. I am glad
to have a chance to finish up a few things without the continual responsibility for a group of workers.
I feel well enough now so long as I hold myself to a conservative pace.
Mr. Seeger inquired in a recent letter whether we need an acknowledgment of the photographs sent
the Library. We do, please; I have to report to the WPA everything dispatched to our sponsors and I
need some evidence of their safe arrival. Mr. Seeger mentioned 88 photographs, but there should be
125, if my memory serves me. He probably counted envelopes instead of prints.Ever cordially yours,
Sidney H. Robertson (Mrs.) Sidney H. RobertsonSR:R

Mrs. Sidney H. RobertsonBox 354Berkeley, CaliforniaDear Mrs. Robertson:
I am glad that you have recovered sufficiently to work again, even if you are traveling at a
conservative pace. Please don't have a relapse.

The photograps are here and I have just counted them carefully. There are 149 of them, wishing I
had time to look at them more closely. Is the letter, acknowledging their receipt, enough of a record
for you?
I turned your express receipt over to the Accessions Division. They are trying nor to get you a refund.
Your Check list of California songs looks very attractive. We very much want, however, about five
copies for the Music Division. Will you please see that they are sent to us promptly?
Wishing you permanent good health for the future, I amSincerely yours,Edward [N?]. WatersActing

Dear Alan:
Just switched on the radio by way of turning off a talkative gardener and dashed for paper to note
down the tune that came booming over --- with a refrain that sounded like "Charley Ross....." when I
heard your name and nearly had a fit on the spot, for I'd tried and tried last year to get your program
at the hours you told me to listen, without success. The trouble was, I judge, that these programs
are played out here in the afternoon from [transcriptions?], instead of being broadcast over the
country all at once, which would make the programs too early here. Or something. Anyhow, it was
swell. And at last I know where to find you! You know I'd never heard you sing before--- how lucky
you are to have such a lovely [qually?] to your voice .... Is there any way of persuading the children to
hold the notes at end of phrases as long as you do? They tend to cut off the sound too soon [md] all
[untrained?] groups do --- but it struck me that perhaps they could be made to use the least possible
time for a breath so asto keep the sand going .... or maybe they would n't! it is easy to make them
self-conscious.
If you do western stuff / again I think we'll hare better material for you this year ---- a book called
the Gold Rush Song Book is about to be published by the Colt Press, and it embodies most of the
singable stuff about mining days and taken from songsters --- as authentic as we could make it. It
should appear within 2 months --- it was orignally announced for Sept. but now they are aiming at
[Imas?] lists... It [ looks?] perfectly magnificent, but for various reasons it is not going to be possible
for [me?] to check over proofs, so I sit and wonder [resigndly?] resingedly just what mistakes I've
made in the original drafts of the adaptations of tune and words, and just what mistakes will have
been [added?] by the various other hands who've copied. A gal named Eleanor [Blask?] had the 3
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
oldest songsters, the idea and the ability to draw [?] some notes for the plates; the rest of the editing
and adaptation of tunes is mine; the typography, which is the raison-d'etre of the volume, is by Mrs.
Grabhorn.
Later will come, I hope, if this volume sells, one full of the songs which were popular in Gold Rush
days, adapted to the tunes named with the texts in the same way, but not limited to the subject of
mines and mining! There are a lot of entertaining ones to do. After that will come, maybe, old songs
still sung today.
We are still without the Raging Canawl! and it must have had a tune since 3 different songs in
songsters were sung to it.
I nearly shed tears over Hog Drovers, Hog Drovers ..... I had forgotten abut that song, but it has all
sorts of pleasant and amusing associations for me.
Jessica Fredericks says you hope to come out here! You be sure to let me know, in [tim?] for us
to drive wherever you are to be, if so..... The idea of ringing in the public schools is magnificent---
there's a big job to be done there, and there is n't anybody who could do it as you can ....... Too bad
you can't give 'em 'Member one night a drizzlin' rain, 'Round ma hart I felt a pain... Fare thee well, ma
[honey?], fare thee well. When my ap'on strings would bow...Etc. That's one of my favorites... what is

Dear Ben:
Sorry not to answer your letter sooner: I have been in a letter-writing [doldum?].
1) Delighted to know the drawins of instruments belonging to the University of California at
Berkeley have gone off to them. It is about 2 years since I borrowed them for 3 months to get them
photographed!
2) Never mind about the records belonging to them. It was a complicated arrangement, probably
there was no complete record of it, I no longer remember the date look it up, even if there were a
record, and trying to do anything about it now is more trouble than it is worth. Jerry [ hada had?] got
it okehed by Dr. SPivacks originally and twice agreed to [?] the blanks afterwards; but this must just
[beone?] of the things that got lost in the shuffle. There were oly 25 blanks or so involved, and as I
left all my duplicating equipment with the U.C. music department the value of the [disks?] in cash is
more than covered. [?]
3) Colin McPhee [oneome?] last night to inquire about some records of Canadian Indian music which
Gilbert Chase was to select and have duplicates sent to him. This has something to do with a project
conceived I believe by Charlie Seeger which is now being carried forward by something called, I
believe, [Instituto?] Indigenista Mexicano which has commissioned a number of composers in N.A.
to write symphonic works based on native themes from their own countries, (Canadian in Colin(s
case). Colin accepted the commission but has been unable to get the material from the Library. He
has just had urgent letters from both Seeger and this Mexican institute asking for the composition.
I told him I thought probably there was difficulty in getting copies / of records made and suggested
he write Mr. Chase again. If you could [unofficially?] let me know what the chances are of getting
this material, supposing Mr. Chase to have made the selection, it would save a lot of wear and tear
all around. If you can't get blanks, or have no technician, or have no Canadian Indian material! or
foresee a delay of several months, I'd greatly [appreciate?] being able to suggest to Colin that he
attack the problem from another angle without further delay ... he [has?] already been waiting
several months, and of course he can't compose a work for full symphony orchestra overnight. It
was Seeger who told him to write to Chase; Carlos Chavez is one of the sponsors of the Mexican plan
and spoke to Colin about it when he was here last month. If this material is really unavailable, Colin
feels he should write turning down the commission right away; he has n't been able to locate usable
material elsewhere.

HENRY COWELL - 61 SEVENTH AVENUE SOUTH - NEW YORK CITYApril 15
Dear Ben:
Mr. McPhee only inquired what I knew about the [situation?] at the Library after his letters to the
Library had gone [unanswered?]; I unwisely injected myself into the situation because I thought
the Library might be unwilling to say categorically that it [could?] not do as originally promised,
or as Mr. McPhee understood that it had promised, and yet you might be able to indicate that
it would be better not to count on it, privately. He was understandably irritated by the whole
situation; I urged him to write again to Gilbert Chase, to whom Seeger apparently originally referred
him, probably during the [interregnum?] at the Archive. McPhee was unwilling to write anybodys
anymore, but I understand he since has done so. So if you have also written him a few anyhow of the
misunderstandings must be cleared up by now.
Documentation for the instruments is included in the report of the California Folk Music Project, a
thin [black?]-bound volume, with photographs, etc., of which [theLibrary?] [wasoriginally?] sent one
copy, as oneof the Project's sponsors; later I gave the Archive another / copy. Only 12 copies were
made, so there are no more available; if you cannot find these, [some?] time you could microfilm
mine if you want to --- it has a summary of the work of the entire project [plusdetai?] ledreport on
certain aspects , including the instruments.
About the Taylor cards: Taylor seemed very fed up with the whole folk lore situation and the thin
hopes for [???] subjects in Universities during the war, etc. He may just have been tired, the night
I saw him! but I gathered he didn't want to be bothered [with?] anything related [to folklore?] ever
again! This doubtless is not a permanent attitude, only it [meansome?] must go a little carefully.
His feeling about his cards is that it is hi research project, not unnaturally, and that he is willing it
should be regarded asa public service when he has finished his plan for it. It is definitely useless to
ask for the cards unless you are prepared to say you will finish [the?] project, [ under his direction?].
He was inclined to resent Alan's attitude about "needing" the cards, not for any good reason that
I could make out, only that he didn't trust / Alan not to give the project a new slant of his own. For
that reason he wrote atone time that he would sendthe cards to the Library only if I would undertake
to see the project through on the lines we began on the Calif. Folk Music Project in Berkeley ---
I had some workers started on it, and had spent some time with Taylor laying but he work. This
might have come about if the job I came east for in 1940 [had?] materialized, but I didn't want the
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
cardsattached to my skirts and wrote Taylor at least twice urging him to send them and let the NYA
people finish them, as soon as Alan was able to free the NYA workers from the archive listings and
could promise to go ahead with the cards.
There is a tremendous amount of work to be done on the cards [as?] they stand, and of course
the published collections they cover must be only about half the field. Alan could never write /
saying he had / workers who could begin on the cards next week, so the matter was dropped. I
believe also that Taylor at one time said photographing the cards was ok by him if it could be done
in Calif., without [sending?] the cards to Washington and back; then later he decided the [?] was to
incomplete, I believe, and that he would prefer not to let / them out of his hands for the present.
If you can afford to have the cards photographed, I suspect the money would be better spent
starting the / listing afresh from the beginning, on yur own basis; you could write Taylor you
are doing this and offer him the material to add to his after the war, or something! Even if he
were willing and anxious to send you the cards it [seemsto?] me to be asking a great deal, with
[transportationas?] [????] is now. I sent Alan [hisletters?] to me; I'd suggest you go over [Alan ???]
[thinking?] and mine. He appears very inconsistent, but from hi [??? I don't?] [???].
He is willing to have someone else complete the work [he?] originally conceived but he
feels no obligation to divert a half-finished research project to sombody's else's purposes.

HENRY COWELL - 61 SEVENTH AVENUE SOUTH - NEW YORK CITY To Albert Elkus [Hend?]. Dept &
[music?] [B.c?] - [Probably?] April 21, 1942
Dear Albert: This is a long - overdue note, first of all to thank you most heartily for the warmth of
yours to Henry & me. (I'm writing quite flat on my back in bed. Whether I've been consigned for
some weeks or months [md] for a very Interesting Reason however, so waste no sympathy on me,
as I'm being spoiled within an inch of my life! I only hope this is legible!) Second: condolences over
the wasted efforts in the direction of [EB.?] - his daughter [Suzanne?] told me the other day that he
has resigned. She fully appreciates your difficulties, & agreed with me that if there is a doubly wrong
way of doing a thing [EB?]j will search it out & insist on it! I took the liberty of giving her enough of
the background so that she might appreciate your efforts & your great goodwill, & mentioned that
the "rudeness" [E.B.?] claimed to be victim of was probably no more than the suggestion that the
[University?] had to have some report on the students 'work, or some other unwelcome impersonal
compusion. Ernie did mention that you had written to apologize, however which was honest of him!
Suzanne said that all their his friends agree he has grown much worse lately, & your troubles are
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
not the only ones! She has been asked several times to arrange lectures by him here but has never
dared suggest it to him, foreseeing endless trouble & impossible complications. She remarked: "After
all, one has only [2?] HENRY COWELL - 61 SEVENTH AVENUE SOUTH - NEW YORK CITY one life to
live!" Certainly no one who [knows?] [2B] will blame the Department; the general attitude among
musicians & college [music?] people in the [last?] seemed to be astonishment at your courage when
the enterprise was first undertaken! It is a great shame, because he does have so much to give.
Third item: The Library of Congress was supposed to replace the blank disks I brought last with me
to record for you on the way. I was so delayed by a series of troubles with my car [on?] route that
I was unable to record in the [Ozarks?] as we had planned this almost [immediately?] on arrival in
[Washington?] [my?] recording machine was stolen. I would like to be sure those blank disks reached
the Dept., & that [the?] my "account" is clear!
The [Span.?] - Calif. songs from the Calif - Folk Music files should have reached you some months
ago, returned with Thanks by the Pan American Union.
The [photoproject?] [drawings?] of folk instruments are now at the Library of Congress & have, I
believe, been photographed for them. A man at N.Y.U. has work shop for [making?] instruments.
He wants to see the drawings, after which the will go back to you. They were very [impressive?] to
[visiting?] [?] & other L. A. folklorists.

June 27, 1942
Dear Mrs. Cowell:
Alan didn't mention two points of business we still seem to have pending with you. First, are the WPA
folk instrument drawings to be returned to you or to some address in California? I want to hold them
a week or two longer in hopes of being able to check the photostats when these finally circulate back
into our hands; but it's really high time the originals revisited their rightful owner.
Second, Dr. Spivacke asked us to obtain two more copies of your reprint from the January California
Folklore Quarterly. Do you have these to spare or should we write for them direct? Where is the
California Folklore Quarterly?
These are not such matters as one should clutter a vacation with, but I'd appreciate your filing
them for attention when convenient. The Archive seems to find it very easy to build up arrears
of unfinished obligations, not huge in themselves but rather terrifying when they stand in the
office in piles. I hope in the absence of the main dynamo to bring most of them approximately
current.Sincerely,

Dear Harold:
Early in the summer Henry transmitted a message from you to the effect that you would like to have
me do more recording on the Pacific Coast. Until now I have been too preoccupied with the various
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
family exigencies that brought us out here to be able to think about it, but today I was invited, ( by
a trained nurse who is a full blooded Indian from Table Mountain back of the Priant Dam 40 miles
away, ) to attend an Indian funeral (as soon as an Indian dies!) and record it if I can. She also knows
an old man at Clovis, 15 miles away who would sing for recording without question, but not, I gather,
without pay. What can the Library do about paying informants?
I promised to be ready when an Indian dies! but think I should look the ground over first, since my
nurse friend thinks I must do any recording surreptitiously. This means, I judge, a mike on a very
long line, to battery equipment in the car some distance away, and Henry to operate one end or the
other, perhaps.
We have no usable equipment here at all. Albert Elkus offers extraordinarily good contacts with
Indians in California, Nevada and the Southwest, and I have good ones myself in Washington,
so perhaps I should pursue whatever offers. Paul Radin encourages me in this and says an
anthropologist would only be indispensable if I wanted complete translations of the texts; if
th records are good, he can [???] use those. Paul seems to think the average anthropologist of
extremely doubtful value in the field! I am not proposing to cover Indians only, of course, but there
seem to be few recordings made with modern equipment, almost none in California, and Albert
Elkus considers a it well worth while. What do you think? Could the Library send me the equipment
John Lomax used for that extraordinary Negro funeral in, I think, S. Carolina?
Elkus says the Univ. of Calif. will pay cost of duplicating, no other cash available before next
summer.
On Thursday evenings here on the ranch ten miles north of Fresno, there is a Second Coming
revival meeting at a cabin 200 yards away from our house, using all the Holiness sect techniques,
exhortation, hymns, testimonials, chanted confirmations, more hymns, sermons by several people
with ejaculations by the congregation, and so [?] on , --- all in [Spanish?]. Music is provided by a
trumpet, a guitar or two,[?] a banjo and four women singers in long white robes... sometimes very
interesting tunes, straight from white spirituals but sung in [Spanish?], with naive words. Christ
is always referred to in the sermons as El Hombre, The Man. I would like to get this music down
and enough of the preaching and testimonials to give the flavor. It is extremely picturesque: one
gasoline lamp, rows of the faithful on benches, beautiful dark faces, an enormous Mexican Indian in
starchy white playing the trumpet, and the vivid wiry preacher standing before a fig tree gesticulating
earnestly.
In addition to battery equipment I should have good electrical equipment I think, don't you? I wish,
however, that I could have the [lightest equipment consistent?] with adequate recording. I always get
along well with those small Prestos, although nobody else liked them, and I think thequality of the
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
records I made was generally considered above the average, was n't it? In this connection, since you
probably know the NY [?] found the copies of field recordings of mine sent them by you unusable,
but strangely enough the San Francisco [?] copied the same recordings from the collection at the
University of California (of which [you?] have the [originals?]) and Mrs. Chen tells me they were used
on short wave broadcasts
Oh for [?] on wire and a well equipped station [?] with special microphone You may be
interested to hear that
for many weeks.
What the Archive most needs, I imagine, is more really pioneer western material. This is extremely
difficult to find in California; the old Californians sing stage songs for the most part when they sing
old songs at all; I have never yet found a real ballad singer, with anything of a repertoire, who had n't
come here from east of the Rockies. I think Nevada, Oregon and Washington would all be better in
this respect, and I would like to propose a trip to Tacoma, Wash. and way points as soon as that can
be arranged. I should have to try to make what contacts I can in advance by letter, in order to be sure
of some records at least [?] before starting out. It is 5 years since I made a rapid trip to Seattle and
back, and this may be difficult I may [?] have to start entirely afresh.
I don't know what to propose about payment, at all. This country is not like the territory east of the
Mississippi; it is sparesely sparsely settled, which results in the often-heard remark out here that
the distances are greater in the West than in the East! It takes fully twice s much time and mileage
out here as it does in the Appalachians to get a given number of records. The very few recordings by
miners in my California collection represent a really killing amount of physical hardship, in the form
of nights spent sleeping on rocks and skipping of meals because I was too far from food to bother,
and hard driving on narrow mountain roads, and so on. Recordings by minority groups: Hungarians,
Armenians, Icelanders and so on -- all except Basques -- just fell into my lap on the other hand, once
I really got under the guard of a given group.
So, the situation would seem to add up like this: Real western stuff, mining, cow country and such
pioneer , are the hardest to get and most expensive, but the rarest and most lacking in the Archive.
Ballad singers are next thinnest and when found usually come from somewhere else: Oklahoma,
Arkansas, [?]
Minority group music is a delicate matter to tap but voluminous once started; the same is true of
American Indian music, though this requires more mileage, comparatively, than the minority music,
since Indians are inaccessible, particularly in / this state.
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
There seems to be a good chance that the first two groups may be better established and more
accessible in Oregon and Washington; a few records at least I can be sure of. Query: How much
mileage, effort and expense should be put into what is chiefly, though not entirely, an exploratory
trip?
You once told me you had calculated that each record in the Archive had cost somebody an average
of $15. I checked on the ones I had made and thought $8-$10 was nearer, but that did n't take into
account all the preliminary explorations I made out here of my own expense which enabled me to
get records quickly later.
What would you think of a $7.50 per record basis for records made in Califonia, you to supply
equipment and blanks? For out-of-state trips, we might arrange a salary plus per diem plus mileage
for a limited period, as for example one to two months; I don't want to go off anywhere for longer
than that anyhow. Of course on the payment-per-record basis you wol would want to set some limit,
say 200 disks a year, or whatever.
Do you want to make me a proposal for work to be done between now and the middle of January,
when we leave for New York? Then we can discuss further plans in person / at that time. I have
two interesting things I am very anxious to do next summer, but would rather discuss them with
you personally later. Meanwhile I would like to get my teeth into Oregon and Washington this fall if
possible.... starting in about a month, or sooner if it can be arranged. Cordial regards - Sidney Cowell

Dear Dr. Emrich:
Miss Candee is taking a holiday but I will get in touch with her presently. Mr. Warner had unkind
things to say about the machine he has, but was cordial about cooperation. He says the machine is
incurably noisy in spite of a couple of repair jobs on it. Somewhere in New York I should be able to
do better.
I wonder if you know that among the recordings I made for the Farm Security Administration are
some that might be useful to you. Dan somebody, a good Serb singer, Eveleth, Minn., recorded with
his tambouritza orchestra some things all Jugo-Slavs are crazy about -- more popular than folk, I
think, but anyhow very fine. Gigi (hard -g-) was the title of one. Perhaps from that you can trace it.
Then among the recordings of the National Folk Festival in Chicago in 1937 there were at least two
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
fine Lithuanian songs -- one is te / famous Ar tu zimai ("Do you remember?") which is not only a
nostalgic recalling of the old country but is the nationalistic equivalent of the Wearing of the Green.
The song was forbidden in Lithuania -- but whether under the Czar and/or the Soviets I am no longer
clear. Anyhow, it was accompanied by a kind of harp or zither called the kankles, if I remember
correctly; and this instrument was such a rallying point for rebel nationalistic emotion that it., like
the Irish harp, was forbidden to be played in Lithuania. I remember this recording as quite god; but if
distance has lent enchantment let me know, I am sure I can dig it up again in New York.
About Gigi, above, I forget to say that it tells about "How a man in the old days who [?] rode a horse
was more of a man than it takes tday to drive a car." But I daresay this is scribbled somewhere on
the album cover.
In my California collection there is some good Jugo-Slav stuff, Slovenian however rather than Serb --
mostly instrumental music, bagpipes and a flute, the svirals, and a nice little knee fiddle whose name
I forget -- by gum it was the [liritza?]. This player was a Croat I think. Also the gusla, --a man who is
considered a very fine guslar and who chants the heroic ballads and accompanies himself.. he is the
man for whose instrument I had to get some hairs from the tail of a horse: Black horse hair would be
too fine, white horse hair too coarse, from an old horse, too tough, from too young a one, too brittle!
So I settled for some Kentucky race horses, color, red, age, seven! This last man is of course a Serb.
I also recorded a Hungarian Chrismas party, with carols, and a little other Hungarian singing that I
remember as quite goo. It was Hungarian?, anyhow, everybody told me fifty-six times, and not Jewish
nor gypsy. I believe there was a lullaby e!
The finest singer of any kind I ever recorded was Reuben J. Baboian or Baboyan, a chef in Fresno.
Magnificent wild singing, some nostalgic national, some dance songs; good voice; mountain
Armenian from Van, not Turkish nor Syrian influence (as [?] might say from the Appalachians. But
less strange to Armenian ears than the corresponding thing here.)
Finns, if interested: Look in both collections, Finnish stuff in Minnesota is probably listed under
Marjorie Edgar's name. As I remember the Berkeley singers, 2 men, were better listening; but there
was a very pretty-pretty girl in Ely, Minn.
Dear me it is so many years since I thought of any of this. Regards. Sidney Robertson Cowell

funny situations a collector gets into, it is unbeatable, exciting and absurd and touching. I was
really there! Let me know what you think! Cordially,[?] HENRY COWELLSHADY, NEW YORKJuly 22,
1952[??]July 28, 1952[?]Dear Duncan:
Henry and I have been invited by our families to make a visit to Calif. this summer as soon as
Henry is able -- he had an operation on his spine in June. He will fly, out the Magnecorder and I
propose to drive, to re-do Warde Ford primarily, also Japanese children's songs in L.A. This had just
been decided when I started to Provincetown to but ter up my Portuguese fishermen and friends;
and on the Kingston ferry I ran into a young woman that Paul Radin has bee trying to arrange
for me to combine forces with for about 3 years. You know his great specialty is the Winngebago
Winnebago ; Mrs. Lurie (Nancy Oestreich) just got her doctorate under Herskovitz; she is the only
young anthropolgist to specialize in the Winnebago language and stick to that area over a period of
years. Her contacts are good, as Dr. Radin's no longer are, and she has an Indian assistant. Last year
she was given a small grant to record, and hired a technician with a machine, but the results were
very disappointing: things blacked out by mistake, labels wrong or omitted, the informants rushed
and irritated, so she stopped the work, and feels she spent her money to no purpose. I offerered to
spend a week or ten days with her in Wis. and/or Nebraska, en route this summer (Aug. Sept or on
return.) We will each pay our own living and travel expenses, but need two things: 1) Reels. 2) Cash to
pay informants, which as you doubtless know is indispensable with Idians, who even pay each other
cash for the right to sing another Indian's song. Can the Library help with this?
Reels: Roughly 15 hours of recording -- 30 reels?? We would of course settle for less if necessary, but
not less than 15 reels I think. She should have duplicates for her own use, and I a couple of reels of
samples which I will make for myself.
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
Cash to pay informants: $150 dollars. If the Library would like a whole ceremony recorded, according
to Radin there is one that would be possible, but must be bought, cost another $150. That is, we
pay for it food, and for an assistant to go around with mike in his pocket-- an Indian. Apparently the
conventions allow for recording to go on, and for it to be ignored, with us at a little distance.
Anthropologists differ as to the significance of this ceremony -- as to what it will prove, that is;
but there is no doubt that it would be of great interest. Some of Mrs. Luries informants are very
"acculturated"; but her Indian assistant is in communication with older Winnebago in Nebraska who
have sent word they wish to record the old way of doing things while people exist who recall it. This
suggests a far more favorable set-up for recording the les modified layers of an Indian culture than
has ever existed so far as I know: we would go in to record for the Indians and at their request. How
extensive this material is, we cannot tell till we get there.
Paul Radin is apparently travelling and I doubt whether I can reach him in time to get him to
write you about this; but as it is something he has himself tried to arrange I am confident of his
enthusiastic support. We will have to know what help we can count on by August 10 in order to
arrange in advance for informants. Would you be good enough to see what you can stir up and let
me know fairly soon, especially if no soap?? Thak you.
Item 2 is this: I have wanted for a long time to see a Ford Family collection appear: the variety is
fantastic: fine Child ballad versions, loggers' songs, local songs, a couple of shaped note hymns. It
would have to be sung chiefly by Warde, but there are also a few records by his two brothers and
his uncle Rob or Bob Walker. By extending it to Ford family friends, you could present a fine logging
community cross-section with, I think, enough variety. I have hesitated to suggest this, as it seems
a funny subject for editing by a woman, but after all it is something I know very well: I spent many
weeks being shown around by the Fords in Wisconsin, visiting logging camps and mills, and later
visited a Yosemite Valley Logging Company above the Yosemite Valley -- no connection with Fords
but a couple of usable -- I think -- songs, and a fantastic contrast: put-up lunches with canned-fruit-
salad, an idea given raucous cheers by the Wisonsin contingent when I told them. I camped with
Ford brothers and their familes awaiting contrsuction jobs on the Shasta Dam in Calif. later, and for

My dear Dr. White:
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
I too am fascinated by, the story you mention, but I fear rather more in the way one in [fascinated?]
by the combinations and permutations of fact with fancy that produce folklore. I recognize about
half the [ingredients?], but .. my feeling is that the chances are against its being true.
Taking the elements one by one: I was going [around?] recording all kinds of traditional music luring
the WPA period (1937-40, roughly) and I never heard of anyone else who used a recording machine
for California for that purpose at that time. I ran a WPA project for California folk music, 1938 and
1939, for the music department of the University of California at Berkeley.
But I recorded no Assyrians, as it happens, and I did not record anyone in either Colma or South
San Francisco. [Gangemen?]: There is an [oft-hold?] tale about a man sent form an AAA garage in
Berkeley to change a tire for me on Shattuck Avenue, who mattered to himself a British ballad I
recognized, thereby crystallizing my determination to ask Albert Elkus to find me some money for
travel after songs in california.
I did call on an [Assyrian?] bar player in San Francisco at the suggestion of Henry Cowell, but this
man never did play for me because he was in mourning for the death of his brother. His (American)
name was George Daniels; he came from [Fiflis?] in Georgia, and a I remember his native language
was, he told me, Persian. He and his wife lived in a flat on one of the streets that run north form Fell
Street, at right angles to the Golden Gate Park panhandle, about 1938. Mr. Daniels and his brother
were house painters; the brother dief of a heart attack on a ladder above Mr. [?], who caught him
as he fell and strained his back in the process. I cannot forebear a digression at this point, if you will
forgive me: The surviving Mr. Daniels suffered a great shock, of course, but also an injury to his back
that was really incapacitating. Doctors at the nearby St. Francis Hospital having done little for it, as
he told me, he then bethought himself of his uncle the camel-doctor in Persia, and of the traditional
treatment he had often observed, for strains and sprains among camels. After prudently asking a
somewhat surprised corner drugstore clerk whether tar would injure human skin, Mr. Daniels went
out to beg a bucket of tar from one of those small city repair crews that go about with a huge kettle
of tar boiling over an open fire, mending rough spots in the city streets with it. He took his bucket
of tar home with him, cooled it off a little and then had his wife over his torso with several layers
tar, to make a flexible but strong support [for?] his back. [Illegible text 7 1/2 lines] 2 Assyrians are
so you doubtless know a small and [acatifred?] remnant of a people -- Mr. Daniels told me there
were only 20 families in the U.S. and no more than 50{?] Assyrians left in the world-- for what [such?]
figures are worth. But I did run into a small group, 8 or 10, very old people who claimed Assyrian
descent, living in [Burlock?]; they were toothless, [decredit?] and their singing so nearly tuneless
that I did n't record them, the more so as they wanted only to sing Christian (Presbyterian) hymne.
This would have been interesting in its way but I often had to decide between several desirable
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
informants, forlack of funds. Anyhow, the point is that it is always possible that I missed a good (by
which I [mean?], a comprehensible) singer among these people, who may later have recorded for
somebody else.
Such is the conservation of certain kinds of traditional song, particularly when associated with
ritual, that theoretically it ought to be possible for a [cuneiform?] tablet and a living 20th century
California singer to coincide. But in my experience with far simpler similar problems, the chances
against actually making this identification would be about a million to one. I may be less receptive
at the moment to this possibility than I should be, on account of 18 months of earnest and
unavailing struggle with the songs of some Gaelic-speaking Canadians, only 3 generations from
the Hebrides. The singers do not read or write Gaelic, and the people who read and write Gaelic
cannot understand their dialect. And the songs have no titles, nor any kind of label, in their [minds?]:
they speak of Fergus' songs or Tom's long song, or the song they sang for the minister with the
beard, and so on. To explain what a song was about was another great difficulty, since Gaelic "has so
many words that you don't have in English,-- a man can make love in Gaelic but English is no good
for that." English is good for road building and garage work, and only partly useful in fishing and
farming, and hardly any use at all in the home.) This was all extremely interesting --[both?] songs and
language seemed entirely identified with the occasion of their use. But at the end I was still without
titles for the Library of Congress to use in its catalog, and the contradictions in the interpretation of
the texts that were offered by various self-styled "Gaelic [sebolars?]" were wildly funny.
It would not surprise me to find the persistence of a text over a very long period in a culture that
had retained its pride in its identify, with some physical isolation, and which had some written
records, no matter how scarce ... as among cetain remote [Sanitic?] tribes. I heard only last week
some wonderful recordings of a remnant of the very clannish Samaritan Jews. Only a few people
[ire?] literate, but there are old scrolls that are consulted by somebody or other in every generation
in order to sustain and correct the oral tradition; and the chanting of the Ten Commandments
seems credibly established as antedating the [Xtia?] era by several-hundred years. But Assyrians all
scattered and adopted other nationalities and languages, an I understand it, so that quite different
factor are involved, which seem to me to incline toward [scattering?] and less of any [consistent?]
cultural tradition, not toward persistence. I do not know whether today's Assyrians speak, or
think they speak or sing, a language peculiar to themselves and identifiable as Assyrian; but it is
my impression that they don't. Without a ritual or a strong cultural tradition like the Latin in our
civilization to keep the language alive, it is my experience that the older chants as to music and text,
die out very rapidly, although more slowly where there are written texts to consult occasionally. I
think that without such texts, the language's survival is indispensable if the chant are not to be lost. 3
One would have to [suppose?] the existence of just the right archeologist, I think-- [a man?] now who
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
not only the [cunciform?] texts at his finger tips but who has also a ready command of the sound of
Assyrian speech, which would have also to be assumed to have survived in a recognizable form ...
you see the difficulties. [?] I am [wrong?] about the survival of the language of the tablets, [then?] this
difficulty is immediately [?]. But then another occupy to me: [??] the cunciform [terte?] [ideconible?,
isepcly?]. If [olar?] archeologist could travel [?] then without forming any idea of the sound of the
language. Funny thing, within the [?] month or two I [read?] somewhere about some [cuniform?]
tablets that recorded a text obviously for use in a song or a chart, but I can't think where, nor can I
find it her now. But it is very hard for me to believe that an archeologist who knew the texts from the
cuneiform tablets would find anything familiar to him in any current Assyrian remnants. yet I could
always be entirely wrong about this!
Dear me, I just thought, was n't Sennacherib an Assyrian? Because if we might trade Ashurbanipal
for Sennacherib,-- somebody or other, an Armenian I think, [?] or maybe a Berb, did sing me a song
about Sennacherib and his chariot. That does not mean at all that either text or tune go back to
Sennacherib's day, of course, any more than the Negro spiritual Go Down, Moses, dates form the
time of Moses.
I will look this up in my notes when next I go to the country where my files are. This was certainly
something I recorded in California, but I played it for no archeologists; whether anyone else did, Dr.
Vincent Duckles, head of the Music Library at the University of California in Berkeley might know, as
the record is there. My notes will enable them to locate the record if you want to [hear?] it.
I should probably explain why I am so inclined to discount the possibility of this identification, if I
may do so in confidence. There lived in S.F. when I was recording there, a neurotic young romantic
named (part of the time; he used other names, I learned later) Leonard Austin. He was in Henry
Cowell's Music of the World's Peoples [?] when I was, in 1933 or so, and he [wespurred?] thereby
to inquiry about San Francisco's [exotic?] populations. He developed a fantastic knowledge of
the haunts of small groups such as people from Cyprus, Madagascar, Swaziland, and so on, and
later did a book called, I believe, "Around the Word in [?] which dealt with various kinds of native
festivals. When it came to matters expressible in figures: street addresses, population figures and
other statistics, I am sure his information was perfectly all documented and reliable. But folk music
seemed to him wildly romantic and exciting and the truth was simply not in him with regard to it.
He guided me to various groups around the Bay, and he accompanied me when I called first on
Mr. Daniels, and I may well have told him about the Sennacherib song. But he created endless
problems: he was always coming to me with lovely tales about some old chant he had learned, which
then proved to be identical with something known to somebody else in another part of the world
or in some old manuscript. He had a scattering of many kinds of knowledge, and always included
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
something concrete like the names "[?] and Ashurbanipal" by way of lending--what is [???] a bald and
unconvincing statement. I remember his claim to know of [?] Chinese chant, for instances, which he
claimed [???] [Esquire?] on and with one found along California [???] -- I forgot. [Illegible text 4 1/2

[?] West [10?] and [??]April 14, 1955
Dear Dr. White:
A postscript to last night's dissertation on Assyrian chants... I have just talked with a Mr. Wilkinson,
archeologist and art expert on the Middle East at the Metropolitan Museum. He said promptly that
the chances were a million-to-one against the coincidence of identical texts form the [time?] of
[Anhurbanipal?]. To my surprise he knows both my Assyrian groups in california, because some of
the men [?] with him at '[digs?]' in the late Twenties. He says, what one would expect, that the notion
of a Fragment of sure [Assyrian?] race is nonsense, and that the identification is with various forms
of the Assyrian Church, whic is supposed to have been the first-established Christian state church,
in I believe the 3rd century. This would argue against the continuity of pre-Christian chants too, of
course.
Mr. [V's?] main argument was on the score or the very great changes in the language since the 5th
century [BC.?] as the Assyrians scattered among other Semitic groups and the language contributed
to Aramsic, Hebrew, etc., where one can find surviving world forms similar to old Assyrian words on
tablets, much as on finds [Saxon?] or Norman fragments embodied in English. But it does not survive
as a separate language, by that name, or in forms identical to any great degree with [Ashibanipal's?]
time. He confirmed my idea that great changes followed the spread of Mchommedanism in both
speech and music, but added something I did not know that [?] doctors of Music" in the [lith?] and
12th centuries colified and largely changed much in the music in all that part of the world, and at
about the same time many new instruments were adopted from elsewhere or invented; the Arabic
influence was paramount not only [???] politically and in fashionable culture, but also of course it
religious forms.
Mr. [V.?] also pointed out [aimiably?] what I feel sure is true: that what one finds inevitably is a
[paralellism?] as to texts and [molodic?] and rhythmic forms, among peoples at a simple level of
culture all over the world, when one examines religious or magical chants and work songs.
AFCCC-COR3.4 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-4
If I understood his very British speech correctly, there was a Dr. MacGowan at "Berkeley" until
recently who had done archeological exploration in the Middle East-- in Palestine chiefly; and his
son did the same in Iran. The older MacGowan--if I am spelling him properly--is now at Chicago; the
younger's whereabouts Mr. W.. did n't know.
So, it's now your turn. But I will still look up my song abot Sennacherib. Only I suppose your historical
point is now spoiled! Sorry!Cordially,
