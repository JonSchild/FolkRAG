W E'RE the finest police in the world, 
In a 
gay dress of blue they enfold us ; 
We arrest all offenders of law, 
And the people are proud to behold us; 
We walk the streets all the long dark night, 
And we take good care to be far from a 
fight; 
Our clubs are hard, and our shields are bright, 
We're the finest police in the world. 
CHORUS. 
We're the finest, we're the bravest, 
We're the grandest police in the world, 
We're the, finest we're the bravest, 
We're the grandest police in the world I 
We're the finest police in the world, 
And our praises are sung in the papers; 
When we find a 
disorderly man, 
Very soon he is cur'd of his capers; 
We are the pride of the nation wide, 
And around our footsteps no law is defied; 
The rogues all fear us on ev'ry side, 
We're the finest pollee in the world. 
We're the finest. eta.

ON 
the soft and snowy pillow 
Oft we turned her little head, 
As she thought she saw the angels 
Hoviing o'er her dying bed ; 
Listen, papa, she would whisper, 
Don't you hear their loving song ? 
They are calling me to join them, 
Papa, won't you come along 1 
en Onus. 
I 
am going, papa, going, 
Don't you hear their loving song ? 
They are calling me to join them, 
Papa, won't you come along? 
Sitting near her little bedside 
Oft we coed her tinted cheek, 
Oft we wrapp'd the little blanket 
'Round her tiny shir'ring feet; 
Even then our pet would murmur, 
Don't you hear their loving song ? 
They are calling me to join them, 
Papa, won't you come along ? 
I 
am going, etc. 
Father, mother, sister brother, 
Come and kiss me ere I 
go 
Far away to meet the angels, 
Said that voice so soft and low ; 
Then there came the final whisper, 
Don't you hear their loving song ? 
They are calling me to join them, 
Papa, won't you come along ? 
I 
am going, etc.

LITTLE voices sweetly calling, 
Calling mamma all the day, 
Oh, it's sweet to hear the darlings, 
Hear the cunning words they say; 
There is music in their prattle, 
Comfort in their happy glee, 
And it is a 
joy to kiss them, 
Or to hold them on our knee.

Little voices sweetly calling, 
Calling mamma all the day, 
Oh, it's sweet to hear the darlings, 
Hear the cunning words they say 
Pretty faces ever smiling, 
Smiling sweetly all the day, 
Oh, it is so nice to watch them, 
Watch our angel doves at play; 
From the early morn till twilight, 
Cheerful as the merry birds, 
They are calling one another 
In the sweetest kind of words. 
Little voices, etc. 
Tiny feet that never weary 
Going up and down the stairs, 
Little minds that are not troubled 
With a 
score of worldly cares; 
Home without them would be dreary, 
Minutes lengthen into hours, 
If the garden of our household 
Had not these delightful fiow'rs.

I'D OFFER THEE THIS HAND OF MINE 
I'd offer thee this hand of mine, 
If I 
could love thee less ; 
But heart so warm and pure as thine 
Should never know distress. 
Mv fortune ' tis too hard for thee, 
;Twould chill thy dearest. joy, 
I'd rather weep to see thee free, 
Than win thee to destroy, 
I'd offer thee, 
I 
leave thee to thy happiness,' 
As one too dear to love. 
As one I 
think of but to bless,' 
As wretchedly I 
rove. 
But, oh ! when sorrow's cup I

Flow sweet twill be for me to think 
it holds no drop for thee. 
I'd offer thee 
And now my dreams are sadly o'er, 
Fate bids them all depart ; 
And T 
must leave my native shore 
In brokenness of heart. 
Then. oh ! dear one, when far from thee, 
I 
steer know joy again. 
I 
would not that one thought of me, 
Should give thy bosom pain. 
I'd offer thee, kc. 
I've roved over mountain. I've crossed over wood, 
Is e 
traversed the wave-ielling sand : 
Though the fields were as grern, and the moon shone as brig,ht, 
Yet it was n,t my cr,‘

Yet happier far were the hours that I

Bows in the valley where the honey bee sips 
The sweetness from many wild flow'rs, 
They have made her a 
grave, our sweet Imogene, 
The darlinc we love to call ours; 
The buttercups bend their bright heads o'er the mound, 
The daisies they grow by her side, 
And often we sit near that sweet sacred spot 
To weep for the dear one that died. 
CHORES. 
Under the buttercups, bright yellow buttercups, 
Darling is sleeping, sweet Imogene fair ; 
Under the buttercups, bricht yellow buttercups, 
Imogene, darling, rests quietly there. 
She left in the summer, the birds on the trees 
Were caroling sweetly the day 
That the anJels from heaven came to our door 
And took little dewdrop away ; 
She left with a 
smile on her lips, pretty one, 
She bade us a 
loving " good night," 
Then down in the valley they made her a 
grave, 
And laid her ' neath buttercups bright. 
Under the buttercups, etc.

Comr, to the window, love, come quick, my pretty dove, 
Lovers in plenty are waiting for thee, 
Show- thy sweet, winning face thro' the white curtain lace, 
Darling, make haste, we are anxious to see; 
Wake from thy happy dreams, for gentle starlight beams 
Shine on your window so charmingly bright, 
Birdies their carols cease, neighbors now rest in peace, 
Come in the calm of this sweet summer night. 
List to the music, dove, hear the sweet songs of love 
That we are sincing so sweetly for you, 
Cr,me to the window, pet, that we may not forget 
She who is beautiful, lovinc and true; 
Slumber no loner, dear, while many beaux are near, 
Wake, now awake, if you take but a 
peep 
At many friends of yore, you often met before, 
Who tl,en will leave you to nature's sweet sleep.

Enter HUNGRY JAKE and JIM.] 
HUNGRY JAKE. —I 
can't go any further on an empty stom-
ach. I 
haven't smelt of a 
square meal for the last six months. 
Free lunches on the island aint what they're cracked up to be. 
Oh, dear! I'm hollow, 
Jim.—Oh, come along. 
You're always growling. 
Why, it 
isn't three days yet since you had a 
peanut. 
HUNGRY JAKE.—I 
want something more nourishing. 
I 
would like to tackle a 
cow or an elephant. 
Jrm.—Brace up. 
We can get a 
good square meal here if 
you only do as I 
say. 
This is the gentleman's house who ad-
vertised in this week's Clipper for two artists in the singing 
HUNGRY JAKE.—W e 
look more in the Sing- Sing line. 
Oh, 
dear! if I 
only had the cover of a 
herring box, or an old India 
rubber shoe. 
JIM.—There you go again. 
Brace up, now, here comes the 
gentleman. 
[Enter Mn. JouNsoN.] 
JIM.— Good morning, sir. 
HuNnnY JARE.—Good morning. [Aside.] I 
hope he'll say 
"

M R. JOHNSON.—Good morning, gentlemen. 
You have 
called, I 
presume, about the advertisement. 
JIM.— Yes ; my friend and myself have just left our cha-
teaux, and wish to accept of your situation merely for amuse-
ment, and more to pass away time than anything else. 
HUNGRY JAKE (
aside).—Just left our chateaux! 
That's the 
first time I 
ever heard the island called by that name before. 
M R. JOHNSON.—Well, gentlemen, what is the style of your 
voices, bass or tenor? 
Or do you play ? 
HUNGRY JAKE (
aside).—I'd like to play with a 
knife and 
fork. 
JrN1.—My friend here is just from the Conservatory at Paris, 
and is a 
tenor of very superior abilities.

MR. JOHNSON.—And yourself? 
Jim.—Oh, I'm a 
bass. 
IIuNGRY JAKE (aside).—Base enough for anything. 
Mn. JOHNSON.—Well, gentlemen, if you will just sing a 
song or an aria, merely to show me the style of your respect-
ive voices, we will adjourn to the dining- room. 
HUNGRY JAKE (
leaning against JIM, aside).-011 my, he 
said eat 1 It takes away my breath.

Hash, hash, mysterious hash I 
In a

Hash, hash, beautiful hash! 
It's a

I've travelled this country thro' and thro', 
This famous conundrum is always new; 
Talk of scrambled eggs, crumbs and crust, 
But mysterious hash is more robust; 
Reed-birds, quail, champagne and ice, 
Canary birds stuffed is all very nice—

An1 revel on lager and Limburger cheese; 
That's the luscious stuff to eat, 
For it makes your breath so sweet. 
Talk of love in Cupid's bowers, 
Talk of the balm of a 
thousand flower--
Cho. Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese! 
Floating so gaily and sweet on the breeze; 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese, 
Bring me a 
dish of sweet Limburger cheese.

There was a 
lord, a 
high born lord, 
He loved a 
high born lady, 
She lived in a 
palace all so grand, 
Till she met with the Gipsy Davy. 
CHORUS, 
Elopements now are all the go, 
They set the ladies crazy, 
Now then ladies all beware, 
And look out for Gipsy Davy. 
This lord he was a 
nice young man 
He set this lady crazy, 
She pack'd up her duds and away she ran 
Along with the Gipsy Davy. 
Elopements now, &e. 
Her parients ravel and tored their hair 
When they found they had lost their baby, 
To think that that high born lady 
Would run off with the Gipsy Davy. 
Elopements now, &c. 
Last night she lay on a 
clean feather bed 
And in her arms a 
baby, 
To-night she will lay on the cold cold ground 
And so * 11 the Gipsy Davy.

How could she leave her baby, 
How'could she leave her own true ' ord

I 
LOVE a 
fellow nice and sweet, 
A 
beautiful brunette, 
lie is not swellish, but he's just 
A 
darling, you can bet ; you bet ; 
His form is beautiful and straight, 
He has a 
manly air, 
And then he has a 
lovely head 
Of black and curly hair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, he is just a 
darling duck, 
My Charlie, sweet and fair ; 
The dearest thing in life to me 
is Charlie's curly hair. 
He has a 
dark and piercing eye, 
A 
killing black mustache, 
And when he promenades the street 
lie cuts a " nobby " dash; you bet; 
The girls they all are after him, 
For them he does not care, 
Altho' they often compliment 
His black and curly hair. 
Oh, he is, etc. 
Together we go out to ride 
Behind a 
trotter fast, 
You ought to see us on the road, 
We never are the last; you bet; 
We " shoot '' past all the single teams, 
Oft beat a " fancy pair," 
And all the time I'm thinking of 
My Charlie's curly hair. 
Oh, he is, etc. 
He calls to see me twice a 
week, 
And brings nice things to eat. 
Which he takes from the pockets of 
his clothes made up so neat; you bet; 
And when he bids me sweet " good night," 
He whispers of an heir 
That we may have in future years, 
With black and curly hair. 
Oh, he is, etc.

PARODY ON " KISS BEHIND THE DOOR." 
ONCE I was so gay like a

But now into a

day. 
SPOKEN.—I'll tole you how it vos. 
You see, I

M AN the life boat! man the life boat! 
Help I 
or you ship is lost ; 
Man the life boat 
man the life boat! 
See how she's tempest-toss'd ; 
No human power in such an hour 
The gallant bark can save; 
Her mainmast's gone, and hurrying on, - 
She seeks a 
watery grave. 
Man the life boat! man the life boat! 
See the dreadful signal flies; 
Ha! she has struck, and from the rock 
Despairing shouts arise ; 
And one there stands and wrings his hands, 
Amidst the tempest wild, 
For on the beach he cannot reach 
He sees his wife and child. 
Life-saving ark! yon doomed bark 
Immortal souls doth bear; 
Not gems, nor gold, nor wealth untold, 
But men, brave men are there I 
Oh, speed the life boat! speed the life boat! 
Oh, God ! their efforts crown I 
She dashes on—the ship is gone 
Full forty fathoms down. 
Ah, see! the crew are struggling now 
Amidst the billows' roar; 
They're in the boat! they're all afloat; 
Hurrah 
they've gained the shore ; 
Bless the life boat! bless the life boat 1 
Oh, thoult hear our prayer ; 
Bless the life boat! bless the life boat I 
No longer we'll despair.

MR. BILLY BARLOW. 
Now ladies and gentlemen, how do you do, 
I 
come out before you with one boot and one shoe, 
I 
don't know how ' tis. but somehow ' tis so, 
Now isn't it hard upon Billy Barlow. 
0 
dear, raggedy 0, now isn't, ka. 
Do show me a 
boarding-house where I 
can stay, 
I'm so hungry and sleepy, I've eat nothing to-day, 
They'll not let me in, at Astor's I 
know, 
But a 
market stall's vacant for Billy Barlow. 
0 
dear raggedy 0, there's a, & c. 
As I 
went down the street the other fine day, 
I 
met two fair ladies just coining this way ; 
Says one—now that chap, he isn -t, so slow, 
I 
guess not, says the other, that's Mr. Barlow. 
0 
dear raggedy 0, I 
guess not, & a. 
I'm told there's a 
show coming into the town, 
Red lions and monkeys, and porcupines brown; 
But if they should show. I 
shall beat them I 
know, 
For they've never a 
varmint, like Billy Barlow. 
0 
dear raggedy 0, for they've, & e. 
I 
went to the races on Long Island so gay, 
The man at the gate he asked to pay; 
What pay. says I, and looked at him so, 
Pass on C31r, I 
know you, you're Mr. Barlow. 
0 
dear raggedy 0, Pass on, &e. 
I 
had been on the track, but a 
minute or two, 
Before the people flocked round me, what I 
tell you is true : 
Who'se that little fat gentleman, does any one know, 
Yes, says a 
young lady, that's Mr. Billy Barlow. 
0 
dear raggedy 0, Yes, says, &e. 
There's a 
darkey been here, who they say is Jim Crow, 
But he cleared out the moment I 
came, you must know ; 
If you doubt what I 
say, I 
can prove it is so. 
Just look at the rigging of Billy Barlow. 
0 
dear raggedy 0, Just look, & a. 
0 dear but I'm tired of this kind of life, 
I 
wish in my soul I 
could find a 
good wife; 
If there's any young lady here, in want of a 
beau, 
It her fly to the arms of sweet Billy Barlow. 
0 
dear raggedy 0, Let her, ece. 
Now ladies and gemmon, I 
bid you good bye, 
I'll buy a 
new suit, when clothes aint so high ; 
My 
hat's shocking bad as all of you know. 
But looks well "n 
the head of Billy Barlow. 
0 dear raggedy 0, But looks, 
NO, NE'ER CAN THY HOME BE MINE. 
I 
ItAvE told thee how sweet the roses are 
In my home beyond the sea, 
Where the dark-eyed maid, with sweet guitar, 
Sits under the orange tree; 
Then fly, oh, fly from this isle of storm, 
Where all that is fair must pine, 
To a 
sky more blue and a 
sun more warm; 
Henceforth let my home be thine. 
I 
have heard thee tell of a 
sky more blue, 
And a 
sun more warm than this; 
And I 
sometimes thought, if thy tale be true, 
To dwell in that clime were bliss. 
But oh! when I 
gaze on my tranquil cot, 
Where clematis boughs entwine, 
The land of the stranger tempts me not ; 
No, ne'er can thy home be mine. 
I 
will sing to thee, if thou wilt rove, 
The songs of the olden time; 
Thou wilt never compare with my ardent love 
The love of a 
colder clime; 
Thou wilt scorn the fruits of thy mountain home, 
Beholding the purple vine; 
Then come to the land of my birth, oh t 
come; ' 
Henceforth let my home le thine. 
Alas! ' tis plain that my mountain home , 
Must ever be scorned by thee; 
And may I 
not fear that a 
time will come 
When thou wilt have scorn for me 
And oh I 
there is one who loves me here, 
Whose voice, if less sweet than thine, 
To my simple taste is far more dear ; 
No, ne'er can thy home be mine.

THE RING MY MOTHER WORD, 
BY 
LOUIS DEL. 
The earth has many treasures rare, 
In gems and golden ore; 
My heart hath one more precious far—. 
The ring my mother wore, 
I 
saw it first, when I, a 
child, 
Was playing by her side ; 
She told me then, ' twas father's gift, 
When she became his bride. 
I 
saw it oft in sorrow's hours, 
Which marked the after years, 
When shining on the soft, white hand, 
That wiped away my tears, 
And eh! I 
saw it once again, 
When, on her dying bed, 
She lifted up her hand in prayer 
And laid it on my head. 
Beside that bed, where fell my tears, 
The ring to me was given; 
She placed it on my hand, and said: 
We'll meet again in heaven I" 
I 
kissed the chee.k I 
oft had pressed. 
From which the rose had fled : 
And bowed with grief, stood inotherls.t,„ 
'Alone, beside the dead. 
Among the blest in realms above, 
Where sorrows are unknown, 
Oh ! may I 
meet my mother dear, 
No more to weep alone. 
Her dying words of love and faith 
I'll cherish evermore, 
Within the heart which holds so dear. 
The r: -.12; my mother wore. 
GOOD- EVENING, friends, pray bow are you I 
We've come to sing a 
little ditty, 
We're out to-night with great delight, 
To see the fashions of the city ; 
I'm this gal's beau, she loves me too, 
You'd best believe it ' tis a 
pity, 
We hardly know what ails us, 
We're such a 
happy pair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, we'll both be married in the spring, 
Oh, yes, we're welcome everywhere, 
My eye, we love to promenade and sing 
We hardly know what ails us, 
We're such a 
happy pair. 
When we walk out the people shout, 
They like to see our fond affection, 
And when they smile to see our stylo, 
We havn't got the least objection. 
We're so gentle, so high we feel, 
We almost blush through our complexion ; 
We envy not the white folks, 
We're such a 
happy pair. 
Oh, my, etc. 
To fancy balls we go each night, 
To cut a 
swell and show my figure, 
I 
dance the Polka with delight, 
And everybody cries, " just tiwg her." 
I 
show my heel in fancy reel, 
I'm such a 
gay and sprightly nigger ; 
We beat the crowd at anything, 
We're such a 
happy pair. 
Oh, my, etc.

WANDERER'S DREAM. 
23 
I'vE been thinking of thee, mother, all this long, long summer 
day, 
For last night I 
dreamed I 
met you, in our old house far away ; 
And methought you smiled upon me, as you used to do of yore, 
And, mother, I 
was happy then, but that sweet dream is o'er ; 
My father's welcome, too, ' twas sweet; his words were soft and 
mild, 
Just as they used to sound to me when I 
was but a 
child ; 
I 
pressed his hand within mine own, its clasp was warm and 
true; 
And, mother, I 
was happy then, with father dear, and you. 
My sister's lips I 
pressed to mine, and clasped her to my heart, 
And she murmured softly in mine ear, " we never more must 
part; " 
She told me she had lonely been, and often wept for me, 
As she feared the wayward wanderer she never more might see ; 
And last, my brother's welcome, his love had ne'er grown cold ; 
He pressed me to his throbbing heart, as he'd often done of 
old; 
He told me I 
was strongly grown, since I 
crossed the stormy 
main, 
But, mother, if my form is changed, my heart is still the same. 
Then methought I 
stole away and sought the garden fair, 
Where blossomed many a 
fragrant flower, of beauty rich n.nd 
rare, 
Then down beneath the orchard trees, where oft a 
child I 
played, 
Once more I 
sat upon the grass beneath the pear tree's shade ; 
Then, with a 
smile upon my brow, I 
sought the homestead fair, 
Lightly I 
bounded through the door; hush ! ' INN-as the voice of 
prayer ; 
My father read the holy page, oh ! how lifelike it seemed; 
And, mother, then it was I 
woke, and found I 
had but dreamed.

No longer could I

'Tis strange how fellows now and then 
Stare in a 
lady's face, 
When she walks out to take the air, 
Or shopping place from place ; 
There's one I've met quite frequently, 
His manners they are free, 
Ile smiles whene'er I 
pass him by, 
" 
Oh, ain't he sweet on me !" 
CHORUS . 
Oh, yes, be is, indeed ! yes, he is 
Completely gone, I 
see ; 
And fifty times a 
day I 
say, 
" 
Oh, ain't he sweet on me." 
I 
meet him every morning most, 
And in the afternoon 
He's sure to pass me, feeling just 
As big as a 
balloon; 
He fixes up regardless of 
Expense, indeed does he, 
He smokes a 
pure Havana, too, 
" 
Oh, ain't he sweet on me." 
Oh, yes be is, etc. 
The other night, when cousin Jule 
And I 
were out to ride, 
We saw a 
fellow driving fast, 
Who soon was by our side ; 
He bowed to us politely, and 
As nice as nice could be, 
And then he gave a 
cunning wink, 
" 
Oh, ain't he sweet on me." 
Oh, yes be is, etc. 
Last Monday afternoon as I 
Was passing down the street, 
I 
dropped my pocket- handkerchief 
Beside a 
fellow's feet ; 
He quickly picked the linen up, 
And cried, " there is no fee," 
While I 
stood gazing at the chap 
That is so sweet on me. 
Oh, yes he is, etc. 
"OH! AINT HE SWEET ON ME ?"—Concluded. 
Young ladies all, if you should chance 
To have a 
lover true, 
Why, also try and have like me, 
A 
fellow sweet on you ; 
Sometimes your lover and yourself 
Don't always just agree, 
And then how nice the subject of 
" 
Some fellow sweet on thee." 
Oh, yes he is, etc.

Come back to New England, and see its green hills,

Are roaming and dancing in ringlets and curls ;

Come back to New England, the pride of our land, 
Where all are received with a 
grasp oT the hand ; 
Where hearts that are honest, and faithful, and true, 
Are anxiously waiting a 
welcome to you ; 
Come back to the homestead all nestled in vines, 
The home where the hop and the green ivy twines ; 
Come back ' neath the roof that once sheltered thee long, 
Come back to New England, the land of sweet song. 
Come back, etc.

There are a 
lot of jol:y cats, 
That often meet at night, 
To hold a

Or else to squall and fight.

And they always are so noisy, oh, 
So noisy oh, s.) noisy oh, 
They always are so noisy, oh, 
Whilst on the tiles they be. 
They fi ,rht, they bite,

There they are again, there they are again. 
Kwatclik pilutt! there they are again. 
Such jolly cats are they. 
They kick up such a 
jolly row, 
In vain to sleep I 
tries, 
Their little claws I'm sure were made 
To scratch each other's eyt-s 
For they always, &a 
They wander round the chimney pots, 
And climb the water spout, 
And oft I 
have to throw a 
brick, 
To put them to tbe rout. 
And they always, &c. 
To watch their gratnbols and their pranks 
SJmetimes is jolly fun, 
Although I 
never shot the cat, 
I 
mean to buy a 
gun. 
For they always, &c. 
They drink our milk and steal our meat, 
And think it not a 
crime, 
And when they bring forth kittens, 
They come fitly at a 
time. 
For they always, &c.

Now there's no one left to love me, 
Friends of old have pass'd away; 
Some are glad in lands above me, 
Where my fancy loves to stray; 
Some in distant homes are dwelling, 
Born a 
joyous life to know, 
While I 
live so sad and lonely, 
With my dreams of long ago. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet long ago, sweet long ago, 
Life now no pleasure can bestow; 
Pure and bright in lands above me, 
Live my friends of long ago. 
Oft a 
friendly smile may greet me, 
But its pleasure soon is fled; 
Ann-el smiles in slumber meet me, 
When I'm dreaming of the dead.' 
Days are dark with clouds of sorrow, 
Hope is dead within my breast; 
Joy to-day, and pain to-morrow, 
Till there comes eternal rest.

DARLING, I 
am growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to-day; 
Life is fading fast away ; 
But, my darling, you will be—will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes! my darling, you will be 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS . 
Darling, I 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away. 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say— 
" 
Oh, my darling, mine alone—alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes! my darling, mine alone, 
You have never older grown ! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love can never more grow old; 
Locks may lose their brown and gold, 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know 
Never, never winter's frost and chill ; 
Summer's warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Sumin?r's warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair— 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below 7 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I

THE SEA. 
Written by BAIIIIY Comment.. 
THE sea, the sea, the open sea, 
The blue, the fresh, the ever free; 
Without a 
mark, without a 
bound, 
It runueth the earth's wide regions round; 
It plays with the clouds, it mocks the skies, 
Or like a 
cradled creature lies. 
I'm on te sea, I'm on the sea; 
I 
am where I 
would ever be, 
With the blue above and the blue below, 
And silence whereso'er I 
go. 
If a 
storm should come and awake the deep, 
What matter I 
I 
shall ride and sleep. 
I 
love, oh ! how I 
love to ride 
On the fierce, the foaming, bursting tide, 
Where every mad wave drowns the moon, 
And whistles aloft its tempest tune, 
And tells how goeth the world below, 
And why the south-west wind doth blow. 
I 
never was on the dull, tame shore 
But I 
loved the deep sea more and more, 
And backward flew to her billowy breast, 
Like a 
bird that seeketh its mother's nest— 
And a 
mother she was and is to me, 
For I 
was born on the open sea. 
The waves were white, and red the morn, 
In the noisy hour when I 
was born ; 
The whale it whistled, the porpoise roll'd, 
And the dolphins bared their backs of gold, 
And never was beard such an outcry wild 
As welcom'd to life the ocean child. 
I 
have lived since then, in calm and strife, 
Full fifty summers a 
rover's life, 
With wealth to spend and power to range, 
But never have sought or sigh'd for change; 
And death, whenever he comes to me, 
Shall come on the wide unbounded sea. 
WE PARTED BY THE RIVER-SIDE. 
We pasted by the river-side; 
The moon looked down on you and me, 
The stars put on a 
look of pride, 
The river murmured to the sea: 
The de-w-drops kissed the blushing rose, 
The gentle winds did sigh; 
One word broke nature's sweet repose, 
The sad word was: Good-bye I 
CHORUS. 
Oil I 
tell me that you love me yet, 
For, oh I 
the parting gives me pain, 
Say, tell me that you'll not forget, 
For, we may never meet again 
We parted by the river-side 
A. tear-drop trembled on your cheek, 
In vain to tell my love I 
tried, 
My heart was sad, I 
could not speak,. 
I 
promised that I 
would be true 
So long as I 
would live; 
The parting kiss I 
gave to you, 
Was all I 
had to give., 
Ohl tell ur 
&03. 
We 
parted by the river-side: 
Ana I 
have roamed a 
distant clime, 
My heart has not forgot its pride; 
For, I 
have loved you all the time. 
And I 
am faithful to you still, 
While I 
believe you true; 
Afar or near, let tome what will, 
ni love you, you, only you.

And well we've braved the storms of life 
Amid inclement weather. 
'Tis fifty years ago, good wife, 
Since we stood up together ; 
And well we've banished care and strife, 
And loved each other ever. 
You then was called the " best of girls," 
You ae the same to- night; 
Although the long and raven curls 
Have turned to snowy white. 
'Tis fifty years, etc. 
'Tis fifty years ago, good wife, 
Since we avowed together 
That ours should be a 
model life, 
And none our love should sever. 
That promise we have kept till now, 
And shall till we depart; 
'Tis pictured on your honest brow, 
It lingers in my heart. 
'Tis fifty years, etc.

SIMPLE SIMON. 
Oh, they call me Simple Simon, though my name is Simon Snip: 
I 
saved a 
little money, so I 
took a 
little trip. 
Go where I 
will, do what I 
may, it always is the same; 
For without an introductien, people seem u 
know my m 
me. 
For they say, Simon ; (that is what you say to me, 
And judging from your smiles around, what a 
Simon I 
must be! 
Oh, my name it seems familiar, and they say with a 
grin, 
And they treat me like a 
Simon, tor they always take me in. 
Oh, I 
thought that I 
could fancy a 
lady in Brcnewry, 
I 
don't think it was Nancy, though she tried to do the gay; 
We went into the country, where she made tie dr.ver tight, 
When she tooli away my money and the driv( r 
wiseed to fight ; 
And he said, Simon, and came a quaring up to me : 
Come on, said he, if you're 
man, what a 
Simon I 
would be I 
He was big enough to eat me, I 
did not wish to stay, 
For to fatten such a 
cannibal, so Simon ran away. 
I 
went to Niblo's Garden to see VT 
White Fawn, 
When 
quickly found that irom my fob my watch was being 
drawn ; 
I 
called Police they turned me 
it for making such a 
noise, 
I 
fancy I 
still hear the voce of all the little I 
oys, 
Saying, Simon and did FO - at me. 
For any one to lose a 
watch, it is such a 
jolly spree : 
There a 
nothing half so funny as a 
watch and etaiin to lose; 
Misfortune to a 
little man is sure tor to amuse. 
I 
looked in vain; for I 
could not find the author of the crime, 
I 
found that locking ior my watch was only losing time. 
I 
said now my poor tick lk

E- top, now my old ticker s

When Ifelt aban I

You simple looking S.mon, now march! I

On every beat that I'm upon, all thiev(a must run away.

THE BELLE OF THE AVENUE. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLy. 
The Music of this sang is published by E. U. 
HARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
My love is the belle of the Avenue, 
She walks up and down ev'ry day, 
And charms eviry one as she passes by, 
So beautiful, graceful, and gay ; 
The swells when they see her go crazy, 
And silently wish they were free 
To walk by her side, but they are denied, 
For she will have no one but me. ( Ch!) 
CHORUS. 
She is the belle of the Avenue, 
Graceful and bright, full of fairy light, 
Sweet-and enchanting with eyes of blue, 
Beaming with love and glee; 
She is the star of socIety, 
Pride of the ball with her fairy form, 
Joy and delight of her home so bright, 
And dearer than life to me. 
Sometimes when it's fine in the afternoon 
Her ma sends her out for a 
walk; 
Now, darling," she'll say, " don't be long away, 
Don't stand with the young men to talk ;" 
" 
0, ma," she replies, " do not fear me— 
You know such a 
thing cannot be ;" 
Then smiling she goes in all her nice clothes, 
And waits on the corner for me. ( Ha ! ha!) 
She is the belle, etc. 
We walk and we talk of the latest balls, 
And view all the styles of the day, 
And when she must leave, oh! you can't conceive 
how much I 
would wish her to stay ; 
But she will return on the morrow, 
That is, if mamma will agree, 
And while we're apart I 
know in my heart 
She's all the time wishing for me. ( Ah!) 
She is the belle, etc.

Fat getting old. and feeble now, I 
cannot work no more;

Ole mama an' ole miss's am dead, dey're sleephe side by side;

De scene am changed about de place, de darkies am all gone;

But de angels watches over me when I

Dar was a 
happy time to me, ' twas many years ago, 
When de darkies used to gather round de door; 
When dey used to dance an' sing at night I 
played the old banjo, 
But alas, I 
cannot play it any more. 
De hinges dey got rusted an' de door has tumbled down, 
And de roof lets in de sunshine an' de rain,

THERE'S MISCHIEF IN HER EYE. 
W HEN first I 
met this fair young girl— 
With roguish eye and golden hair— 
I 
fell in love as you'd have done, 
Although i 
she warned me to beware. 
But for my folly I 
am sad ; 
Her ways have caused me oft to sigh— 
I 
never dreamed she was so bad, 
Nor saw the mischief in her eye. 
CHORUS. 
Her mind is full of wickedness, 
I'm sad enough to cry, 
For to my sorrow I 
have learned 
There's mischief in her eye. 
When first I 
called she asked me in, 
And motioned me to have a 
chair, 
And on that chair there was a 
pin, 
Which she had placed in mischief there. 
As I 
sat down I 
felt the point, 
And quickly rose to heave a 
sigh, 
And as I 
looked into her face, 
I 
saw the mischief in her eye. 
Her mind, etc. 
But soon I 
found another seat, 
And looked as though I 
meant to stay, 
When softly she came up to me, 
And handed forth a 
sweet bouquet. 
And as I 
smelled a 
fragrant rose, 
Her faultless band I 
mildly squeezed, 
And something sweet I 
meant to say, 
When suddenly I 
stopped—and sneezed. 
Her mind, etc. 
Such wickedness I 
could not stand, 
And took my hat to leave the place, 
But as I 
went to put it on, 
Flour covered all my head and face. 
Then with a 
cry I 
madly tied, 
And never stopped to say good-bye, 
But as I 
passed the door I 
said, 
There's devilish mischief in your eye. 
Her mind, etc.

AM a 
gay and dashing belle, 
As you are all aware, 
I 
love to dress and cut a 
swell, 
With me none can compare ; 
I'm always cheerful, light and gay, 
My heart is never sad, - 
I 
strive to cast dull care away, 
To keep my spirits glad. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, I 
am a 
gay young belle, 
And well I 
love to cut a 
swell ; 
Among the boys, and girls as well, 
I 
am called the Female Swell. 
The other day I 
caught a 
beau, 
lie offered me his arm, 
He talked so sweet, we walked so slow, 
He worshipped every charm ; 
He spoke his heartfelt love for me 
In words I 
cannot tell. 
"Pray stop," said I, " for don't you see 
That I'm the Female Swell." 
Oh, yes, I 
am a 
gay, etc. 
As I 
walk down the crowded street 
I 
toss my flowing curls, 
And smile on every gent I 
meet ; 
l'm envied by the girls, 
The little dears they are so shy, 
Their thoughts they dare not tell, 
They are afraid to wink so sly, 
Like me, the Female Swell. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, I 
am a 
gay young belle, 
I 
love to dress and cut a 
swell; 
Amon -* the bilys, and girls as well, 
I 
am 
the Female Swell. 
THE SPOT I 
LOVE: 
How I 
love the deep shade of the wildwood, 
How I 
love the old spot in the dell, 
Where some one so often has met me, 
Each time the same story to tell. 
When others had joined in their pleasur 
And were romping in happiest glee, 
Alone I 
have sought the dear treasure 
Who has waited so fondly for me. 
CHORUS . 
How I 
love the deep shade of the wildwood, 
how I 
love the dear spot in the dell, 
Where some one is anxiously waiting, 
Waiting his story to tell; 
Where some one is silently waiting, 
Waiting for me in the dell. 
Sweet moments of gladness I've squandered, 
With some one I 
often have met, 
And sometimes in sadness I've wandered 
To the spot I 
shall never forget; 
The dear shaded spot in the wildwood, 
The moss- covered seat in the dell; 
From the earliest days of my childhood 
I 
have loved their sweet soothing spell. 
How I 
love, etc. 
As I 
sit neath the trees gently sighing, 
As I 
list to the sweet words of love, 
I 
think how the moments are flying, 
how soon we shall find rest above; 
As I 
list to the words he is saying, 
Sweet words that I 
never can tell, 
I 
know that my love i3 still deeper 
For the dear shaded spot in the dell. 
How I 
love, etc.

THE LADIES' MILE.—[CONCLUDED.] 
I 
see my friend, Lord Allcash, 
And his chum, the Duke of D., 
They want to know the latest news, 
And so they come to me. 
I 
tell them a 
good story, 
And the duke, a 
queer old file, 
Goes off to spread the last ton mot 
Along the " Ladies' mile." 
Cho. I

There's Charlie Trevor of the Blues— 
" 
Ah, Charlie, how d'ye dol 
When did you see the Langford girls ? 
They're rather sweet on you ; 
I 
thought you'd gone abroad, perhaps." 
Says Charlie, with a 
smile, 
" 
We fellows like home duty best, 
Alory, the Ladies' mile.' " 
Cho. I 
caster, e„,:c. 
Who is it with the ponies there I 
And looking, so demure, 
She hasn't missed a 
single day 
This season, I 
am sure. • 
She drives the neatest pair in town, 
That little Jessie Lyle, 
But all that glitters is not gold 
Alon ,, the " Ladies' mile." 
Cho. I 
canter, er.c. 
Then, when the mile begins to thin 
Of lovely forms divine, 
I 
take another canter round, 
And then c/o home to dine. 
I 
meet w:th fellows at the club— 
We smoke, and talk a

Of what we've done, and whom we've met.

TRA LA LA, GEORGE. 
'Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SEELLT. 
My love is young and fair and sweet, 
My fancy she can please, 
But 0, she is inclined to flirt 
With every one she sees; 
Whenever she goes out alone 
She's sure to catch a 
beau, 
But then she says it's all for fun, 
And that's no harm, you know. 
I 
want her to be mine, 
And oft I 
tell her so, 
But though she don't decline, 
She wont say yes or no. 
CHORUS. 
Tra la la, George, 
You must go and ask papa, George, 
Tra la in, George, 
You must go and ask papa, George, ha, ha! 
Her father is a 
gruff old man, 
With lots of worldly pelf— 
He says his charming daughter is 
A 
fortune in herself; 
In that, of course, we both agree, 
But when I 
speak about 
her hand and heart we have to part, 
For he coolly kicks me out! 
I 
see my love each day, 
She says it is a 
shame; 
What will we do ? I 
say— 
Her answer is the same—

THOSE laughing eyes, those laughing eyes, 
how beautiful and bright; 
Like glitOring gems, like glitt'ring gems, 
They sparkle in the light. 
As sunlight on the dancing waves, 
Those radiant orbs of thine, 
As coral from the rocky cave, 
Yes, brilliantly they shine, 
As sunlight on the dancing waves, 
Those radiant orbs of thine,— 
As coral from the rocky cave, 
Yes, bri:liantly they shine. 
Those lau2hing eyes, those laughing eyes, 
They wreathe a 
magic spell, 
Round the enchantel gazer's heart: 
In vain he breathes farewell. 
He seems to doubt, now gazes still— 
Now hope, now fear, denies ;

That sunny-ey'd, rosy-cheek'd lass, 
With a

With always a 
smile as you pass. 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Clyde, 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
Lives my own sweet Kitty Clyde. 
With a 
basket to put in her fish, 
Every morning with line and a 
hook, 
This sweet little lass, 
Through the tall heavy grass, 
Steals along by the clear running brook. 
She throws her line into the stream, 
And trips it alone the brook side ; 
0 
how I 
do wish 
That I 
was a 
fish, 
To he caught by sweet Kitty Clyde. 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Clyde, 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
Lives my own sweet Kitty Clyde. 
How I 
wish I 
was a 
bee, 
I'd not gather honey from the flowers, 
But would steal a 
dear sip 
From Kitty's sweet lip, 
And make my own hive in her bowers, 
Or, if I 
was some little bird, 
would not build nests in the air, 
But keep close by the side 
Of sweet Kitty Clyde, 
And sleep in her soft silken hair. 
Sweet Kitty, dear Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Clyde, 
In a 
sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
Lives my own sweet Kitty Clyde.

I

In the distant long ago. 
When hope smil'd on my life's dawning, 
For I 
knew nor care nor woe. 
By my side there tripp'd a 
maiden 
Passing fair and dreamine-eyed. 
Rosy smiles and eyes love- laden 
Reveal'd thought her tongue denied. 
Dreaming eyes! Dreaming eyes! 
Dreaming eyes of long ago. 
Dreaming eyes ! Dreaming eyes! 
Dreaming eyes of long ago. 
I 
recall so well that olden, 
Ever unforgotten time; 
It was in the glorious, golden, 
Merry laughing summer's prime; 
After summer came December, 
Roses perished in the snow ; 
While I 
live, I 
must remember 
Dreaming eyes of long ago. 
Dreaming eyes! Dreaming eyes ! 
Dreaming eyes of long ago. 
Dreaming eyes ! Dreaming eyes ! 
Dreaming • eyes of long ago.

Then halloo, halloo, halloo, Gregalach, 
If they rob us of name and pursue us with beagles, 
Give their roofs to the flame and their flesh to the eagles. 
Then gather, gather, gather, gather, gather, gather, 
While there's leaves in the foreq, and foam on the river, 
Macgregor despite them shall flourish forever. 
Glenorchy's proud mountain, Colchurn and her towers, 
Glenstrae and Glenlyen no longer are ours, 
We're landless, landless, landless,

Thro' the depths of Loch Kathrine the steed shall career, 
O'er the peak of Benlomoml he ;, alley shall steer, 
And the rocks of Craig Royston, like icicles melt, 
Ere our wrongs be forgot, or OM* vengeance unfe!t.

I 
TOOK my love one ev'ning, 
When the summer moon was beaming, 
Thro' silent arbors gleaming, 
Where Cupid has control ; 
I 
wanted to tell her 
How dearly 1 
adored her, 
But oh, she would not listen, 
Tho' I 
tenderly implored her ; 
Oh, love, oh ; love, why don't you heed me 7 
How can you treat me so 7 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not my pain; 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
cnoaus. 
Oh, ain't you awful; 
it's wrong you know to love me so, 
Yes, you are awful ; 
Your like I 
ne .er did see ; 
Oh, ain't you awful ; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Dear me, you're horrid ; 
Why don't you let me be 7 
To make my feelings clearer, 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said I'd like to hear her 
Say yes, and ease my mind ; 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention ; 
She said mamma would scold her, 
If such things she dared to mention; 
" 
Come, love," I 
cried, " we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind." 
" 
Oh. no, oh, no," she said. 
" 
Don't ask me now to wed; 
What would the people say 
If we should run away 7 "

AIN'T YOU AWFUL.---Continued. 
She talked on useless matters, 
Till my patience was in tatters, 
Just as a 
woman clatters, 
When silent she should be ; 
I 
begged her to listen, 
And drew her close beside me; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes defied me, 
And soon she told me with a 
smile 
That she did not care for me; 
My love was all in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
Oh, ain't you awful, ete.

And it's little I 
care for my life anywhere,

take for old Ireland's sake, 
And I'll pledge all belonging above, 
'Tis a 
handful of turf from the land of me birth, 
From the heart of the country I 
love. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Then won't that poor lad in his exile be glad, 
When he sees the bright present I 
bring 
And won't then the flowers in their elegant bowers 
Breathe forth the perfume of spring 7 
Oh, Erin, Machree though it's parted we'll be, 
'Tis a 
blessing I 
leave on your shore, 
Though your mountains and streams I 
will see

Till I 
cross to old Ireland once more.

My button-hole bouquet, I 
wear it ev'ry day, 
Because it catches all the pretty girls ; 
For when I'm out to walk, I 
love to hear them talk, 
And see them toss their captivating curls. 
Some say that I've got roguish eyes 
And quite a 
pleasing nose, 
While others fall in love at once 
With all my stylish clothes ; 
Again they'll say, my black mustache 
Is nobby, neat and gay, 
But all are struck completely with 
My button-hole bouquet. 
My button-hole, etc. 
Let others drink the best champagne, 
And eat the richest game, 
Or let them drive about the town 
A 
trotting horse of fame; 
For I 
would rather starve myself 
On two fish-balls a 
day, 
Than promenade the streets without 
My button- hole bouquet.

Oh ! the river is up, and the channel is deep, 
And the wind blows steady and strong; 
Let the splash of your oars the measure keep, 
As we row the old bo tt along. 
Oh! the water is bright and flashing like gold 
In the rays of the morning sun: 
And old Dinah's away, up out of the cold, 
A-gotting the hoe-cake done.

Down the Ohio; 
Repeat. 
Down the river, down the river, 
Down the Ohio. 
Oh! the master is proud of the old Bioad-horn, 
For it givos him plenty of tin ; 
Oh! the crew they are darkies, the cargo's corn, 
And the money comes tumbling in. 
There's plenty on board f3r the darkies to eat, 
And there's something to drink and to smoke, 
There's the banjo, the bones, Itnd the tambourine, 
There's the song, ad the comical joke. 
Oh! the river is up, and the channel is deep, 
And the wind blows steady and strong, 
Let the splash of your oars the measure keep, 
As we row the old boat a'ong. 
Down the river, down the river, 
Down the Ohio; 
Down the river, down the river, 
Down the Ohio. 
Repeat. 
In Scarlett towne, where I 
was borne, 
There was a

When green buds they were swellin',

For love of Barb'ra Allen. 
He sent his man unto her then, 
To the towne where shee was dwellin', 
You must came to my master deare, 
Giff your name be Barb'ra Allen.

And ore his heart is stealin: 
Then haste away to comfort him

lovely Barb'ra Allen. 
Tho' death be printed on his face, 
And ore his hearte is stealing, 
But little better shall he bee, 
For bonny Barb'ra 
So slowly, slowly, she came u p, 
And. slowly she came nye him; 
And all she sayed, when there she came,

Fare Nell, said Barb'ra Allen. 
He turned his face unto the wall 
As deadly pangs ho fell in; 
Adieu, adieu, adieu unto you all, 
Adieu to Barbara Allen. 
She turned her body° round about 
And spied the corps a

She, on her death-bed as she laye,

As she was walking ore the fields 
She heard the bell a

And every stroke did seem to say; 
Unworthye Barbara Allen. 
With scornful eye she looked downe 
Her cheek with laughter swellin; 
Whilst all her friends cried out amaine, 
Unworthy° Barbara Allen. 
Hard-hearted creature him to slight,

When he was alive and neare me. 
Farewell, she sayed, ve virgins all,

JOHN BARLEYCORN IS A HERO BOLD. 
Written by J. B GEOGHEGAN. 
Music by JOHN BLOCKLET. 
John Barleycorn is a 
hero bold, 
As any in the land, 
For ages good, his fame has stood, 
And will for ages stand. 
The whole wide world respect him, 
No matter friends or foe, 
Whate'er they be that make to free, 
He's sure to lay theta low 
CHORUS. 
Hey, John Barleycorn 
Ho, John Barleycorn ! 
Old and young thy praise have suhg, 
.John Barleycorn. 
Now see lihn in his pride of growth, 
ills robes all rich and green ; 
His head is spear'd, with prickly beard, 
Fit Knight to serve a 
Queen. 
And when the reaping time comes round, 
And J ) 11 ,1 
is stricken down ; 
He yields his blood, for England's good, 
And Englishmen's renown 
Hey, John Barleycorn, dx. 
The lord in courtly castle, 
And the squire in stately hall ; 
The great of name, of birth and fame, 
On John for succour call. 
He bids the troubled heart rejoice, 
Gives warmth to natures cold; 
Makes weak men strong, and old one's young, 
And all men brave and bold. 
Hey, John Barleycorn, &c. 
Then shout for great John Barleycorn, 
Nor heed the luscious vine; 
I've not the mind, much charm to find, 
In potent draughts of wine. 
Give Inc my native nut brown trie, 
MI other drinks I 
scorn ; 
True English cheer is English beer, 
Our own John Barleycorn.
