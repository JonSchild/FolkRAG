Y OU'VE been drinking—what a 
pity 
Such a 
man should be a 
slave 
To that dreadful king of ruin; 
Would you fill a 
drunkard's grave ? 
Can you know what you are doing, 
When you lift the fatal cup 
To your lips 
Oh, think a 
moment; 
Father, husband, give, oh, give it up. 
CIIORTJS. 
You've been drinking; if you'll only 
Turn aside the fatal cup, 
Joy will take the place of sorrow; 
From this moment give it up. 
You've been drinking; oh, what sorrow 
These few words to me impart; 
Think of friendship, think of honor ; 
Think of mother's broken heart; 
Is it true that you are willing 
To be numbered with the lost ? 
Think of home; oh, think of loved ones; 
Give, oh, give it up at any cost. 
You've been drinking, etc. 
You've been drinking; if you'd only 
See yourself as others do, 
You would listen to the pleadings 
Of the friends that pray for you. 
One by one companions leave you; 
One by one your honors fade; 
Step by step you'll earn the title, 
" 
Drunkard, drunkard, of the lowest grave." 
You've been drinking, etc. 
You've been drinking; in all kindness, 
Listen, ere it is too late; 
Choose between a 
man of honor, 
Or a 
drunkard's fearful fate ; 
One road leads to wealth and glory, 
And the other leads to shame ; 
Can you then refuse me, darling 7 
You will never, never drink again. 
You've been drinking, etc. 
WHAT IS HOME WITHOUT A MOTHER-(IN.

Words by GRACE CARLETON. 
Music by A. P. NIITT. 
W HAT 
is home without a 
wife 
To cheer our lonely way 7 
What is home without a 
babe 
To bless us day by day 7 
Who would miss a 
mother's smile, 
The best the world e'er saw ? 
But what is home, 
Alt, what is home, without a 
mother-in-law ? 
SPOKEN.—Before I 
was married I 
knew nothing about it, but 
now, au ! alas !— 
cuonus. 
Oh, that man to joy is dead— 
Naught his gladness can restore— 
If he's to an orphan wed, 
And has no mother-in-law ! 
Home is sweet when full of love, 
Tho' poor that home may be; 
Go and search the wide world o'er, 
No dearer place we see; 
When in distant lands we roam, 
'Tis cherished more and more, 
And then it is we sigh for her— 
Our own dear mother-in-law! 
SPOKEN.—I 
really do " cherish my home," but under the cir-
cumstances " more roaming and less sighing " would greatly in-
crease the " cherish," because—. 
Oh, that man, etc. 
Who cloth watch our every step 
With never-tiring eye ? 
Who will chide each little fault 
With many a 
weary sigh 7 
Who can make our cottage blessed 
As Eden was of yore 7 
Our wives are fond, but what is home 
Without a 
mother-in-law ? 
SPOKEN.— Of 
course I 
can " go " a 
little watching and chid-
ing, but as for my " cottage being blessed," you will agree with 
me in saying— 
Oh, that man, etc.

WHAT IS HOME WITHOUT A M OTHER-(IN-
LAW) 
?—Continued. 
Sweet her kind endearing smiles, 
Like sunshine after rain; 
Sweet her oft bestowed advice 
That charms the heart from pain; 
Bless the dear old party's curls, 
And never-ending jaw; 
No pleasant home should be without— 
Without a 
mother-in-law. 
• 
SPOKEN.—My fortunate friends, it is not for me to expatiate 
upon her noble qualities of heart and mind. 
I 
leave it for oth-
ers to enlarge upon the subject, and simply reply to this con-
undrum, " Get one for yourself," for— 
Oh, that man, etc.

W HAT is home without a 
wife 7 
"[Is her smiles that make home dear ; 
All is lost when her sweet life 
Departs, with many a 
bitter tear! 
My early love is in the grave, 
My home once bright is so no more; 
Above her now the willows wave, 
And naught can e'er my joy restore! 
What is home without a 
wife ? 
'Tis her smiles that make home dear; 
All is lost when her sweet life 
Departs, with many a 
bitter tear! 
She was like a 
sunny beam, 
All the world she was to me! 
Life it was a 
blissful dream; 
'Tis now a 
weary and troubled sea! 
I 
long to clasp her to my heart 
In yonder radiant home above; 
There every sorrow shall depart, 
And be forgot in joy or love. 
What is home without a 
wife ? 
'Tis her smiles that make home dear; 
All is lost when her sweet life 
Departs, with many a 
bitter tear!

W HAT WOULD MAMMA SAY ? 
On, GET ALONG, JOSEPH. 
The Music of this song is published by W HITE & GOIILLAUD, 86 Tremor 
St., Boston. 
Price 35 cent. 
Now some girls are bashful, 
And others are bold; 
Now I 
knew a 
charmer 
Of nineteen years old ; 
About her, like some others, 
There was much pretence, 
For, at the least thing, 
She'd be sure to commence (with her) 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, fie, for shame, 
What would mamma say ? 
What would papa say'? 
Oh, my, fie, for shame, 
Get along, Joseph, do. 
I'd take her about 
To wherever she'd please ; 
When we were alone 
She'd appear ill at ease; 
Now a 
kiss once a 
week 
Every fellow'd expect, 
But when I 
tried for one, 
She'd be sure to object, ( with her) 
Oh, my, etc. 
Her pa and her ma 
Out of town chanced to be, 
So I 
called on my charmer, 
And with her took tea; 
The time like a 
slow 
Quaker's meeting did pass, 
Till she somehow by accident 
Turned out the gas. 
SPOKEN.—There we were all in the dark. 
I 
was afraid to 
move for fear of breaking something, and she couldn't or 
wouldn't find the matches. 
When she found I 
didn't move, she 
said— 
Oh, my, etc. 
She seemed oh, so awfully 
Coy and demure, 
That I 
thought her complaint 
Only marriage would cure; 
(1)

WHAT WOULD MAMMA SAY ?—Continued. 
So I 
asked " If she'd wed ?" 
Did she think she would die? 
She pretended to faint, 
But her only reply was— 
Oh, my, etc. 
Now I 
found out this bashful 
And timid young lamb 
Was simply a 
con-
Glom-er-a-tion of sham; 
To two other parties 
Her kisses were free; 
Perhaps she had one of them, 
But she didn't " hare me," ( with her) 
Oh, my etc.

Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY. 
LONG, long ago, when wild and gay, 
I 
rambled from friends and home, 
Strayed from the scenes of boyhood's play, 
'Mid strangers to live and roam ; 
Only in dreams and fancies bright 
Can I 
see my loved ones of yore; 
But now I'll go back to my old delight, 
And I'll be a 
rambler no more, 
No more, no more, no more--
I'll be a 
rambler no more. 
Years I 
have lived in distant lands, 
And thought of the gladsome past; 
Oft I 
have sighed to press the hand 
That lingered in mine the last; 
Sad I 
have been at night and day, 
Far away from those I 
adore; 
But homeward affain I 
will go, so gay, 
And I'll be a 
rambler no more, 
No more, no more, no more— 
I'll be a 
rambler no more.

FUNNIEST NIGGER ALIVE. 
Now all white folks dat are here to-night, 
I'll sing a 
song to you, 
De people say it's very nice, 
Because it's something new ; 
'Tis all about a 
gal of mine, 
To please me she does strive, 
Says she to me, my dearest Clem,

CHORUS. 
Den ob course, white folks, I'll do my best, 
To please you I 
will strive, 
Because my dearest said I 
was 
De funniest nigger alive. 
One night I 
took her to a

only could, 
For de funniest nigger aliv3.

PATRICK'S DAY PARADE.

Price 40 cents. 
SAINT PATRICK was a 
gentleman, 
Sure his name we celebrate, 
And on the seventeenth of March 
The Irish concentrate; 
A 
bran-new hat on each man's head, 
And a 
green necktie that's newly made; 
The left foot first, then lightly tread 
In the Patrick's day parade; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow, 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
CHORUS. 
We shout hurrah for Erin go bragh, 
And all the Yankee nation, 
Stars and stripes, and shamrock bright arrayed; 
The Irish shout, the girls turn out, 
To see the celebration; 
We march stiff as starch, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
You should see the marshal on his horse, 
Like Napoleon Bonyparte, 
And as he rides along the line, 
he'd break each lady's heart, 
And if the rain should fall down then, 
We hoist our umbrellas high, 
For history states that Irishmen 
Are always warm aad dry; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc. 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
And though I'm not a 
drinking man, 
On that day I'd drink my beer; 
I'll wear the shamrock in my hat; 
The green, my boys, ' twill never fade, 
And march along with Dan an' Pat, 
In the Patrick's day parade; 
Then two by two away we go, 
tip Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc.

MY LOVE TO THE WAR HAS GONE. 
As sung by Miss ANNIE ADAMS. 
Arranged by W. S. M ILTON. 
broken-hearted quite, for me there's no delight, 
Oh! dear, oh! dear, what shall I 
do '? 
My love to the war has gone, and left me here forlorn ! 
Oh I 
dear, oh! dear, my hopes are few. 
CHORUS. 
I 
wish there was no fighting, I 
wish there was no wars, 
If I 
the Goddess were of Love, I'd rule it over Mars ! 
Or if our kings and rulers, they must bark and bite, 
Let those who make the quarrel, take upon themselves to 
fight. 
I 
shed tears fast as rain, and when I 
sleep would fain, 
My screams in dreams alarm the neighborhood round, 
For I 
fancy I 
can see my love so dear to me, 
My Fred, there dead, on the cold, cold ground. 
I 
wish, etc. 
I 
cannot sleep at night, and I've lost my appetite. 
Behold, untold, you all may plainly see, 
I'm wasting fast away, by inches, ev'ry day! 
Oh! yes, oh ! yes, it's a 
case with me. 
I 
wish, etc.

Words and music by Oro. G. 
HART. 
COME to me closer, my darling, look once upon me again; 
Speak to me fondly and truly, tell me the cause of your pain; 
Did I 
speak thoughtless or chiding, did I your heart ever 
grieve 7 
Don't keep the truth from me hiding—kiss me, and say you'll 
forgive, oh, forgive. 
No one but what have their failings, try to forgive and forget; 
And if you'll love me as ever, life will have charms for me yet; 
Say then again that you love me, never shall change while we 
live ; 
Just once again tell me, darling—kiss me, and say you'll forgive, 
oh, forgive. 
A 
11, tell- tale smile, I'm forgiven ; now are my troubles all o'er, 
Like Cupid's arrow it's driven thro' to my heart's very core ; 
Smiles breaking from you, my darling, thus ever smile while 
we live ; 
Remember to err is but human, so kiss me, and say you'll for-
give, oh, forgive.

YOUNG FELLAH, YOU'RE TOO FRESH. 
SERIO-COMIC SONG. 
Written and composed by Josnra P. SKELLY. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. IL HARDING, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. IL HARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
BECAUSE I am a 
countryman, 
And a 
stranger in the city, 
All sorts of tricks they play on me, 
And they think their actions witty; 
When I 
go out I 
turn about, 
And peculiar smiles I 
see; 
" 
Oh, ain't he fresh 1" I 
hear them shout, 
While they take long looks at me. 
SPOKEN.—I 
can't understand it at all. 
No matter where I 
go, 
I 
hear some personal remarks. 
I 
don't like personal remarks. 
They strike deep into my sensitive breast, and make me swear. 
I 
say, " Dem it, what does it mean 1" and echo answers, " Dem 
it, what does it mean?" 
The very day I 
arrived in this city I 
asked a 
man up at the Grand Central Depot if he knew where I 
could engage a 
nice furnished room. " Oh," says he, " you're 
after furnished rooms, eh? 
Well, sir, you're in the wrong 
neighborhood; you don't belong here. 
Well, sir, I 
suppose 
you'll keep correct by following your nose !" 
I 
told him be 
was very impertinent. But as I 
walked away in silence and dis-
may, I 
heard the fellow say in a 
very peculiar way— 
CHORU S. 
Young fellah, you're too fresh, 
Young fell* you're too fresh; 
It strikes me very forcibly, 
Young fellow, you're too fresh. 
One day last week I 
took a 
car, 
And a 
stranger sat beside me, 
Who stole my watch and pocketbook, 
Though to prove it be defied me; 
I 
went and saw a 
man of law, 
And begged his best advice; 
" 
My friend," said he, " you're very fresh 
Why, you've just come off the ice." 
(1) 
YOUNG FELLAH, 
YOU'RE TOO FRESH. 
Continued. 
SPOKEN.—I 
thought that a 
very strange expression for a 
man 
of law. 
I 
told him he must certainly be mistaken, for I 
had 
never been on ice in my life. " Oh, yes, you have," says he, 
" 
metaphorically speaking, you have, sir; you have been on the 
ice of innocence; you have lived in an atmosphere of Arctic 
virtue, free from the burning influence of metropolitan wicked-
ness." 
He wanted to convince me that I 
was an ice man, I 
sup-
pose. 
But as he could give me no satisfaction for the loss I 
sustained, I 
left him; and as I 
came down stairs I 
beard him 
say— 
Young fellab, etc. 
I 
took my girl to Central Park, 
And while there I 
grew quite spoony ; 
I 
asked her if she'd marry me ; 
" 
Why," says she, " you must he loony ;" 
I 
told her no, it is not so, 
I 
assure you, Pm quite sane ; 
You know I 
love you very much— 
Oh, don't let me love in vain. 
SPOHEN.—She didn't seem to understand my feelings correct-
/ 
ly, although I 
poured out my love in strains worthy of a 
trou-
badour. 
All she would say was, " Oh, don't! please don't! I 
want to go home ! please don't !" 
" 
Nay, home thou shalt not go 
Till reasons good I 
know 
Why thou wilt not bestow 
Thy love on me, 
And fill with glee 
This breast now shadowed o'er by woe. 
By jingo! yes, the cause I'll know 
Speak out! Oh, fairest creature speak! 
Tell me what secret bate thou 'last ! 
The tale I 
bear may make me weak, 
And all my hopes and fancies blast, 
But I 
must know! yes, I 
must know, 
Wherefore thou slightest me." 
I 
began to get excited, so she thought she had better explain 
herself. 
You may judge of my astonishment when she remark-
Young fellah, 
fellah, etc.

RAILWAY GUIDE. 
As sung by JENNIE H UGHES, 
I 
HAD to make a 
journey a 
little while ago, 
Somewhere down the Jersey Central, you must know ; 
A 
splendid-looking man, he was seated by my side, 
He asked me if I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
The man he was troubled with absence of mind. 
The ticket for his journey he had left it far behind, 
lie could riot recollect the town to which he wished to ride, 
So he begged that I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, he had actually forgotten the name of the 
town that he wished to travel to. Could only remember that the 
word contained the letter B, M or K. So I 
began to run through 
a 
list of towns whose name contained that letter, such as : 
CISORUS. 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, Neversink and Squadunk, 
There's Peekskill and Pishkill and Catskill beside, 
Weehawken and Hoboken, Binghamton and Stonington, 
lie said he'd sure to find it in my Railway Guide. 
Then I 
produced my Appleton, and said to him, " Good man, 
Take the book I'm reading and find it if you can 
He took the volume from my hand and eagerly he tried 
To find the place he wanted in my Railway Guide. 
He searched o'er every leaf, and turned o'er every page, 
Until at last the fellow he got in quite a 
rage, 
lie soon turned round to me, and bitterly he cried : 
" 
Dear Miss 
I 
cannot find it in your Railway Guide." 
SPOKEN.— Although he said he had read all through, 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, etc. 
I 
reiched my destination and was going to alight, 
lie placed his hand upon my arm, and said with much affright, 
" 
Oh, dear Miss! don't leave me all alone to ride, 
What shall I 
do without you, and your Railway Guide 7" 
S 
id 1, 
" 
Oh no, I'm going down now to my hotel, 
You, sir, cannot walk with me, for it would not look well," 
But he linked his arm in mine, and kept marching by my side, 
lie kept a 
firm grasp on me and my Railway Guide. 
(1)

RAILWAY GUIDE.—Continued. 
SPOKEN.— And, said he, if we put our heads together, we 
shall certainly soon discover whether it is— 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, etc. 
He walked with me in silence, some distance on the road, 
I 
knew not bow to leave him, when I 
got to my abode ; 
And all that afternoon, the foolish fellow tried, 
To pay attention to me and my Railway Guide; 
And once he plucked up courage, and squeezed my 
little glove 
lie suddenly discovered that he was deep in love ; 
He proposed and I 
accepted, I'm soon to be his bride, 
And thus I'll gain a 
husband with my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN.— And he tells me it makes him feel so happy, that 
he don't care if he never arrives either at 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, etc.

B OTH.— To Bunker's Hill we'll march away, 
'Tis there we'll give the foe fair play ; 
Come along, you butchers out of Spain, 
We've whipped you once and we'll do so again 
SHE.—Now mind, Johnny, and make the enemy run, 
You look so nice when you shoulder your gun. 
HE.—If I 
only get behind their backs, 
You bet I'll see them make tracks. 
SHE.—But you must fight them face to face, 
If they fight me they'll have to race, 
For he who fights and runs away 
Will live to fight another day. 
To Bunker's Hill, eto.

SOAP FAT MAN. 
AIR. —" 
Little Brown Jug." 
I 
KNEW a 
nigger that was so thin, 
Dey used to call him high- go- Fling ; 
He used to go wid a 
gal of Kildare, 
And wasn't they a 
healthy pair. 
CHORUS. 
Yaw I 
yaw! yaw! you and me, 
Shoo fly, will you lef me be. 
One night dis colored gal and he 
Went to have a 
jolly spree ; 
Dey had a 
fight, and he hit.her wid a 
ham, 
When along came her fader, de soap fat man. 
Yaw ! yaw ! etc. 
Her fader he got in a 
sweat 
And grabbed dis nigger by de neck, 
Dat put dis feller in a 
raae, 
And den he flew for a 
Broadway stage. 
Yaw ! yaw ! etc. 
Her fader he went home with de gal, 
And soaked her head in a 
soap-fat barrel ; 
Said he to her, " why did you go 
Wid such a 
man dat would treat you so 7" 
Yaw ! yaw ! etc. 
YOUR MONEY IS YOUR FRIEND. 
You may talk your best of friends, but the only one to me 
Is the money in your pocket-book as you can plainly see; 
For when a 
man is flush of cash, and money he can lend, 
He's courtel by a 
score of men who claim to be his friends. 
CHORUS. 
So never let yourself run short, 
And all your money spend, 
For when it's known that you are broke, 
You haven't got a 
friend. 
If sickness lays a 
hold of you, and your purse it has run low, 
If you ask some one to wait on you, they do it very slow ; 
But don't go it with a 
rush when you've plenty cash to spend, 
What is it I 
can do for you, you know I 
am your friend. 
So never let yourself run short, etc. 
So now pray all take my advice and never do get rash, 
But always try and manage to hold on to all your cash, 
For what I 
say you know is true, as through this world you 
wend, 
They all can say just what they may, but your money is your 
friend. 
So never let yourself run short, etc. 
ONE afternoon in winter, 
When the snow was falling fast, 
A 
walking down a 
by street, 
There a 
maid I 
chanced to pass. 
Her face it looked quite ruddy, 
At least I 
thought it so ; 
I 
turned around and spoke to her, 
A 
walking in the snow. 
Walking in the snow, boys, 
Not going very fast, 
I 
thought it mighty pleasant, 
And the time so quickly passed ; 
Oh, she's a 
little darling-, 
As time to me did show, 
I 
bless the day I 
met her 
A 
walking in the snow. 
As we walked along, not thinking 
Of the time that flew so fast, 
She said to me, in sweetest tones, 
" 
I've reached my home at last." 
As by the door we parted, 
I 
said to her, " good-bye, 
I'll see you, love, to- morrow, 
As the twilight hour draws nigh." 
Walking in the snow, etc. 
A 
year and more we courted, 
Without having any strife, 
I 
asked this darling creature, 
If she would become my wife. 
She said to me, " my loved one, 
Anon I'll let you know, 
But if I 
do, I'll ne'er forget 
Our wallfing in the snow." 
Walking in the snow, etc. 
CLOTHES-PIN GEORGE. 
BANJO SOLO. 
I'm clothes-pin George, who plays de bones, 
And makes de banjo ring; 
The girls say I'm too sweet to live, 
When I 
begin to sing. 
I'm going to tell of a 
pretty girl, 
A 
meerschamn-colored belle ; 
She's by- per- coon in the fish-ball room, 
At Leland's big hotel. 
I 
met her first at, a 
fancy hop, 
In South Fifth Avenue; 
When I 
got there my charmer fair 
Was worrying an oyster stew. 
I 
sought an introduction and 
I 
soon was by her side, 
Which made me feel as happy 
As a 
soft clam at high tide. 
I 
asked her for to fly with me 
To some secluded spot ; 
She said it wasn't fly time, 
And thought she'd better not. 
We agreed to wait till summer, 
Till the beans and peas were ripe ; 
But she choked that night with a 
Russian towel 
She ate for a 
piece of tripe. 
TYROLEAN DUCKS. 
As sung by JENNIE H UGHES. 
W HENEVER ducks go two by two, 
They're surely got something in view, 
And what it is they will not tell, 
Although themselves they know it well, 
They smooth the feathers on their back. 
With a 
loving quack, quack, quack, quack. 
CHOULTS . 
Quack, quack, quack, quack, 
And little ducks words never lack, 
Tra oh la uh, tra la, tra lah uh, all 
Quack, quack, quack. 
Whenever ducks go three by three, 
It puzzles much both you and me ; 
Are there two drakes and but one duck, 
Or but a 
single drake in luck ? 
They smooth the feathers on his back, 
With a 
loving quack, quack, quack, quack. 
Quack, quark, quack, etc.

T i SOUR KROUT BAND. 
W ords by E. 
D. 
GOODING. Sung by LUKE Seim°Intel-T. 
Am.—" Rollicking Rams." 
ONCE I was a 
member of de Sour Krout Band, 
Yes, I 
was a 
member of de Sour krout Band, 
They could drink all night and never get tight, 
And bum around till morning. 
Veil, I 
never will forget dem times, 
For I 
veil remember dat I 
spent my dimes, 
What matter was dat—you see I 
got fat, 
For money we was scorning. 
Von night I 
went to serenade a 
little Dutch gal fair, 
To tell de truth, I'm much afraid I 
got drunk while I 
was dere, 
And between lager and benzine, I 
was drunk as ever seen. 
(Speaking.) 
CHORUS. 
Because I 
was a 
member of the Sour Krout Band, 
The Sour Krout Band was de happiest in de land, 
Drink lager all night and never get tight, 
And bum around till morning. 
Veil, I 
thought I 
better go and take me a 
wife, 
For I 
loved a 
Deitch gal dearer than my life, 
She was so pooty—dey said she was a 
beauty, 
And she valtzed just like a 
fairy. 
She lived in a 
country where there was no rows, 
Yes, she lived on a 
farm and she milked de cows, 
And every mornin' she'd drive the town in, 
To sell milk from her fadder's dairy. 
One day when she sold de milk all out, 
I 
ask her to go mit me, 
I 
buy her limberger, lager bier and sour krout, 
how it ended you shall see, 
We had a 
fight—she hit rue in de snout. 
Veil, what about ? 
(Speaking.) 
Because I 
was, etc. 
So den I 
got married, and settled for life, 
And we lived so happy, no words or strife 
For about two weeks—when I 
saw her tricks, 
She wouldn't getup in de morning ; 
I 
told her get up and she hit me on de head ; 
She hit me on de head. while laying in de bed, 
I 
took her waterfall and throw it gin de wall, 
And told her den take warnin'. 
She den went up to de policeman's place, 
And angry words did mutter, 
She said I 
knock her down and hit her by de face, 
And had mc rested for salt and butter, 
Put me in a 
cell—well, very well, 
She can go to—de devil. 
(Speaking or not.) 
Because I 
was, etc. 
NEVER GO BACK ON THE BOYS. 
Now my wanderings are over 
I 
hope I 
am greeted by all, 
Then try and assist a 
poor brother, 
Let his offerings be ever so small ; 
Though some people and fortune may sever, 
And have not a 
dollar for toys, 
But then if I 
do live forever, 
I'll never go back on the boys. 
CIIORUS. 
So here's we may never know sorrow, 
Together we'll share all our joys, 
I'll meet you again on the morrow, 
And I'll never go back on the boys. 
When a 
man has acquired wealth plenty 
To buy all this world in its joys, 
You'll find nineteen out of twenty 
Will turn their back on the boys ; 
They forget that they once was lonely, 
And think of their troubles no more, 
They're down on a 
friend because only— 
This friend he chances to be poor. 
So here's we may never know sorrow, etc. 
I've travelled this wide world over, 
The South, the East, and the West, 
And at the end I 
discovered 
That here in the North was the best ; 
The people up here can live quietly, 
And have all the world in its joys, 
That is if they only act rightly, 
And never go back on the boys. 
So here's we may never know sorrow, etc.

DARLING, I

Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to-day ; 
Life is fading fast away ; 
But, my darling, you will be—will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes! my darling, you will be 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS. 
Darling, I 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away. 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say— 
" 
Oh, my darling, mine alone—alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes! my darling, mine alone, 
You have never older grown ! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love can never more grow old; 
Locks may lose their brown and gold, 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know 
Never, never winter's frost and chill ; 
Summer's warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer's warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair— 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below 1 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE. 
Tuts world's a 
cold and selfish one, 
As many thousands know; 
Who once were blessed with hope and joy, 
But now are fallen low; 
Whose hearts were ever kind and warm, 
Nor turned from grief aside, 
But always lent a 
listening ear 
When pain and sorrow sighed. 
Then let us aid their sad distress, 
For we like them perchance 
May crave the favor of the world, 
To give us another chance. 
We cannot search their breaking hearts, 
To know the anguish there, 
But kindly acts may heal their smart, 
And soothe their sad despair ; 
For many whom you meet to-day, 
In sorrow broken down, 
Possesses hearts as kind and true 
And noble as thine own. 
Then do no not turn away from them 
With cold and haughty glance, 
But lift your fallen brother up, 
And give him another chance. 
The riches of the world were made 
Not for a 
selfish end, 
But that we generously might spare 
Some for a 
suffering friend. 
No matter what the faults may he 
Concealed within his heart, 
To save the wretched erring one 
Is a 
true and manly part; 
Then when you see a 
fallen man, 
With sorrow in his glance, 
Don't crush him farther in the dust, 
But give him another chance. 
BEAU BELLES ; 
Oa? THAT'S THE W AY THE BELL GOES. 
DICK W IIITTINCTON came back to town 
When Bow Bells seemed to call him, 
And tell him of the great renown 
That after would befall him; 
Everybody has a 
way 
Of fancying the words they say, 
And to me they seem to tell, 
Swinging to and fro, 
Every beau should have a 
belle, 
Every belle a 
beau. 
CHORUS. 
Beau belles and belle beaux, 
That's the way the bell goes; 
Ladies never sell beaux 
When they're very swell beaux, 
When they're out at elbows, 
They know how to tell beaux; 
Beau belles and belle beaux, 
That's the way the bell goes. 
With bachelors I 
don't agree 
Wherever I 
may find them, 
And dearly do I 
like to see 
The pretty maidens bind them 
BEAU BELLES.—Continued. 
Alatrmony does them good, 
Though they little thought it would, 
And the bells they seem to state, 
Swinging to and fro, 
lie is glad to get a 
mate, 
Very well we know. 
Beau belles, etc. 
An old maid's very sad and prim, 
And she'd always be tart, 
But she gives up ev'ry whim 
When she gets a 
sweetheart; 
All at once her eyes are bright, 
All at once her heart is light, 
And the bells they seem to say, 
Swinging to and fro, 
She shall always bless the day, 
First she had a 
beau. 
So now to all the single folk 
This good advice I 
tender, 
Don't fight against the marriage yoke, 
But cheerfully surrender; 
You shall find my words are true; 
Ev'ry joy shall wait on you, 
And the bells shall ring and say, 
Swinging to and fro, 
Here's another pair to-day, 
Happy down below. 
Beau belles, etc.

SKELLY. 
I 
AM a 
swell of the day as you see— 
All other swells are but models of me; 
You must have heard of the name which I 
bear, 
Surely you must for I'm known ev'rywhere; 
Gills are enchanted when I 
am in view, 
Gouts are bewildered and gaze at me too; 
Some criticise me and stare while they say, 
" 
Oh ain't he nobby, that swell of the day !" 
CHORUS. 
I 
am the swell of the day— 
That' s 
what the people all say ; 
Go where I 
will they say to me still, 
lie's a 
genuine swell of the day. 
Now I 
confess I'm a 
little low down ; 
How can I 
help it when all thro' the town 
People are praying for times to improve'? 
Still I'm contented and keep on the move— 
Why should I 
grumble when care I 
have none '? 
All my delight is in fashion and fun, 
Friends crowd around me, and wine makes us gay, 
Then they all flatter the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell of the day, etc 
I 
am accomplished and very refined; 
Once I 
was rich, but my purse has declined ; 
Love is a 
stranner as yet to my heart, 
But from the ladies I 
ne'er can depart, 
They are the cause of my joy and despair; 
None can resist them, so charming and fair; 
Some spoony fellows they drive to dismay, 
But they all cling to the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell of the day, etc.

THERE'S a 
letter in the candle, 
And it points direct to me; 
How the little spark is shining, 
From whoever can it be ? 
It get's brighter still and brighter, 
Like a 
little sunny ray, 
And I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drives suspense away. 
C11011US. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me, 
And send a 
loving message 
From far across the sea. 
Hope and fear alike perplex me: 
Oh, superstitious dread, 
how many idle fancies 
You conjure in my head; 
When those we love are absent, 
how wantonly you play— 
Ev'ry shadow seems a 
substance, 
And drives suspense away. 
Bright spark of hope, etc. 
How gladly I 
remember, 
'Tis two short months—no more, 
Since a 
letter in the candle 
Shone out as bright before; 
Then the darling messenger 
Came prompt and safe to me; 
If this is only from the same, 
How welcome it shall be. 
Bright spark of hope, etc. 
THE BOLD MILITIA MAN. 
BEnoLD a 
noble hero, 
Behold a 
man of might; 
I 
never have a 
fear, no, 
For I 
never have to fight, 
And I 
hope I 
never shall have to, 
As it would not suit my plan. 
CHORUS. 
Then shout hurrah, shout hurrah. 
For a 
bold militia man; 
Then shout hurrah 
For a 
bold militia man; 
So shout hurrah for glorious war; 
I'm a 
bold militia man. 
My uniform so splendid 
Quite captivates the fair, 
Such grace and valor blended 
YOU don't find everywhere; 
But of all I 
like the servants, 
For from them I 
get the scran. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, the servants—for your humble servant they 
know how to reward my generous devotion to my country, and 
they do reward me with their masters' victuals; and when I 
recount to them the deeds of daring I 
have done, they— 
Shout hurrah, etc. 
I've been in sev'ral battles, 
Sham fights of course I 
mean, 
And where the powder rattles, 
Why there I'm never seen; 
You may find me in the rear, 
But never in the van. 
SPOREN.—Ah, I 
have seen some service—I 
have been in the 
battle of Brighton on Easter Monday, and a 
night attack at Al-
dershot at the end of a 
field day—I 
remember once in the midst 
of the fray we lost sight of the enemy altogether, but presently 
we found them; ' twas in a 
public house ; the order was given 
to charge, and we charged them, and they charged us—in fact, 
overcharged us, sixpence a 
pot for fourpenny ale, but I 
beat 
them all at drinking it— 
So shout hurrah, etc. 
Of war I've such a 
notion, 
So all the soldiers say, 
That Pm sure to get promotion 
If with them long I 
stay ; 
I 
shall become a 
general, 
Or a 
torp'ral if I 
can. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, they say I 
shall soon become one of three—a 
corp'ral, a 
gen'ral, or a 
scoundral, and who knows but what one 
day it may be the latter ?— 
So shout hurrah, etc.

Music by CEIAXLES E. PRATT. 
Tonx from home, I'm sad and weary, 
Far from scenes that once were bright; 
Wand'ring ' neath the sky so dreary, 
Pity the homeless one to- night! 
Darkly dawns for me the morrow, 
Coldly now the stars look down; 
Nothing left me but sorrow— 
I'm beneath Misfortune's frown! 
cnorms. 
Torn from home, I'm sad and weary, 
Far from scenes that once were bright; 
Wand'ring neath the sky so dreary_ 
Pity the homeless one to-night. 
Gone for me the sounds of gladness, 
Gone the joys that once I 
know; 
Help, oh, help me in my sadness, 
Kindly hearts so good and true I 
Lonely in the cheerless city, 
Storms around me fiercely blow; 
Who will on me now take pity, 
While I 
wander to and fro 
Torn from home, etc. 
Beam no gentle smiles to cheer me; 
Once I 
gazed in eyes so fair! 
Dear and loving ones were near me; 
Now I've naught but wild despair I 
No soft mother- hands to bless me, 
No fond kiss at close of day! 
No wee darlings to caress me— 
Homeless, helpless, now I 
stray. 
Torn from home, etc.

Words and Music by J. P. SEELLY. 
Hs takes me gently round the waist, 
lie holds his arm just so, 
I 
place my willing hand in his, 
And gayly off we go; 
He's never weary of the dance, 
And I'm about the same, 
And when the music sounds no more, 
I 
cry, Oh, what a 
shame ! 
SPoKEx.— Yes, indeed, I'm quite sorry when the dance is 
over; it seems like waking from a 
sweet little sleep. 
Of course 
my Charlie is the whole cause of it—everybody is aware of 
that— because you know— 
He's such a 
lovely waltzer, 
t3o graceful he can go, 
Oh, he's such a 
lovely waltzer, 
My darling, dancing beau! 
Around the floor with many more, 
We go in wild delight; 
We think of nothing but the dance. 
While in the mazy flight ; 
We seem to float upon the air, 
Like angels from above, 
And everywhere we take our share 
Of music, dance, and love. 
SPOKEN.—Under some circumstances it might 
delightful, but with him it's— well, you can guess 
when I 
say--
not seem 
now nice it is 
He's such, etc. 
I 
can't endure those old quadrilles, 
And reels—oh, gracious, don't, 
Don't speak of them; if you insist, 
I 
plainly say I 
won't; 
I'm far above those worn out things, 
They're much too full of halts; 
No dance to me can ever bring 
Such pleasure as the waltz. 
SPOKEN.—And he's such a 
glorious fellow! 
Sometimes when 
the dance is over he says," Come, love, and have some soda water. 
You like soda water, I 
suppose ?" I 
tell him I 
do like it very 
well. 
Then he says, "Soda I 
I" 
And if there happens to be a 
bright moon looking down from the sky, he often tells me that 
he wonders which looks the most glorious, the moon or my 
eyes. 
I 
say, " Hush ! don't talk nonsense." 
But then I 
don't 
care what he says—my admiration is all based upon the fact 
that--
He's such, etc. 
With mellow strains from jolly Strauss, 
And gleaming lights around, 
' 
Our forms entwined, our joy combined, 
We hear the gladsome sound; 
We think no more of worldly woe, 
While quickly flies the time; 
The music comes so soft and low, 
I 
think it quite sublime. 
SPOKEN.—Sublime, did I 
sayl 
Yes, that's just the word. I 
may seem a 
little enthusiastic, but I 
can't help it 
It's all be-
cause— 
He's such, etc.

Or a

At any rate they're all agreed 
I'm something in the city.

3. Perhaps I 
meet with Smith, we have a 
glass, 
And talk about the weather, 
When in comes Brown—(you all know Brown)— 
We " hob and nob" together; 
When I'm gone, Brown says, " Who is that chap I" 
"That's Johnson, rather witty; 
What is he 
blest if I 
can tell, 
He's a—a 
something in the city." 
SPOKEN.—Of course, a 
fella couldn't walk up to another fella, 
and ask the fella how he got his living, could he ?—it would puzzle 
some fellows to tell, wouldn't it?—so I 
find it considered highly 
respectable to be— 
G110.—Something in the city, ezc. 
4. On peoples' curiosity 
I'd never put a 
stopper, 
So let them think me what they choose, 
As long as its something " proper ;" 
But if I 
tell you—you'll keep it dark, 
Or else 'twould be a 
pity— 
Well, now, when I'm in the city, I 
am 
Something in the city. 
Cho.—I'm something, in the city, 
Yaas, something in the city, 
You'll find it highly proper, to be 
Something in the city. 
SOME fellers are so orful fond of Marget, 
And others go as far as Rome, 
Some fellers do the Rhine—some noodles 
Get a- saying there's no place like 'ome; 
Some do the lakes and mountings, 
And some like the open sea, 
But I 
wouldn't give fa.rden a 
for the lot, boys, 
Gay Paree is the place for me. 
CIIORUS. 
I'm called Parisian '.Arry ' cause I 
am so fond of Paree 
Pm a 
proper sort of swell they all can see; 
As I 
does my prornenards down the jolly Dullevards, 
All the pretty French girls are spoons on rue. 
It's very seldom I 
comes over, 
And the reason's—why, you see, 
Is, the journey from " Calley " to Dover, 
Is a 
rort of thing as don't suit me; 
When I 
visits Goswell Road, too, 
The spot where I 
was born, 
And think of the beautiful Paree, 
My feeling's overco:ne with scorn. 
SPOREN.—Can't help it. 
IN 
it's " nowhere," when I 
gaze 
mind me of Paree a 
little bit. 
of it anywheres, so excuse me 
'hen I 
looks at the Goswell Road 
at Leicester Square, it don't re-
I 
looks round and don't see any 
if I 
say— 
I'm called, etc. 
" 
PARISIAN 'ARRY."— Continued. 
I 
has " Degenare " and some " cally" in the morning, 
Then I 
promenards about as I 
please; 
About six o'clock I 
toddles off to dinner 
At a " caffy " among flowers and trees! 
Then perhaps I 
does some billiards, 
Or if for dancing inclined I 
feel, 
I 
calls out " Alley voo" to a " coachong," 
And he drives me to the " Gay Mabille." 
SPOKEN.—That's the proper sort of life; it's what we Paris-
ians call " Boco-tray jolly magnifik," which means, " right up 
to the knocker, proper, and no mistake." 
All the people know 
me, and that's why— 
I'm called, etc. 
Yes, the French swells they all know 'Arry, 
'Cause I 
meets 'em on the " Boy de Boolong," 
And the French girls they want me to marry, 
But I'm looking out for one with " Larjong ;" 
Now whenever you thinks of roaming, 
And you want to see some sights, 
Just make up your mind and come over, 
And I'll put you on your feet to rights. 
SPOKEN.—You can live like a 
lord very moderately, when you 
know the way. 
put you up to it, and show you the " Roos," 
and the " Bullevards," and the " Caffies," and the " Morgu," 
and the " Shams Elizas "—and see that your " Sally Marngers"

Only say the word—over you come, and ask for 
me at the " Restantey Post," and you'll find— 
I'm called, etc. 
THE SIX-FOOT GUARDSMAN. 
A 
six-foot Guardsman, Joe my name is, 
A 1 
shot so true my aim is, 
For courage, too, well-known my name is, 
As you'll shortly see ; 
I 
am my country's brave defender, 
Pride of all the female gender, 
Nursemaids young and housemaids tender 
All make love to me! 
SPOKEN.—Abem—now then, you silly villains, attention; eyes 
right; and gaze upon the greatest warrior that England ever 
produced. 
They've got some of the " finest " men in the world 
in our regiment, and " I'm one of them." 
I've had more stripes 
than any other private in the army ; I've got ' ern in any quan-
tity, but I'm so very bashful that I 
likes to keep ' ern covered 
over! 
Talk about bravery! why I'm a 
terror to the enemy on 
the field of battle, and the admiration of all the servant girls in 
St. James' Park, and as I 
march along they say to one another , 
" 
Oh, isn't he a fine-built' man! There's muscle for yer. He's 
Just the sort of chap to—" 
cuonus. 
Stand at ease! eyes right! attention. 
Charge I 
make ready for foes prevention; 
Twenty years and then a 
pension 
Of a 
"bob" a 
day! 
I 
tun a 
most enlightened scholar, 
Very seldom out of collar; 
In a 
week I 
make a 
dollar 
By odd jobs I 
do. 
My comrades, tho' good hands at fighting, 
Are not dabsters at inditing— 
Pay rue well to do the writing 
All their sweethearts to. 
SPOBEN.—Now if there's one thing as I 
likes more than an-
other it's standing at ease, it comes so natural to me, for when 
I 
was a 
schoolboy, learning my letters, I 
couldn't quite get to 
(1) 
THE SIX-FOOT GUARDSMAN.—Continued. 
1', consequently I 
always " stood at E's." 
Girls don't mind 
" 
standing a 
tease" now and then, and I 
delight in teasing 
nursemaids; I 
does to them what the chap did to the flea when 
he made it die a-larfing—I tickles ' ern under the ninth rib. 
They say, " Lawks, Colonel, how can you be so rude ?" 
But 
when I 
arkses ' em to take my arm, they feel quite proud of 
themselves, and well they might, for who is better able than me 
to— 
Stand at ease, etc. 
The " bobbies " stare at me, and wonder, 
Look at me as black as thunder, 
For I 
compel them to knock under 
To this soldier gay ; 
I 
court their cooks, which sends them raving, 
Get the scraps for which they're craving, 
And if themselves they're not behaving, 
Take their gal away ! 
SPOKEN.—Yes, it's all a 
case with the " raw" lobsters now; 
servants like " boiled " ones the best, and when they takes their 
quarters' wages, they give the greatest portion to us, besides 
what nice little snacks they gives a 
fellow now and then, and I 
recollect last summer when Dorothy Doublechin, the fat cook, 
gave me a 
slice of cold fat pork, which I 
shoved in my coat tail 
pocket, and the sun was so hot that it drew all the fat clean 
through the cloth where I 
had been sitting on it. 
They put nie 
in the guard- room for spoiling' her Majesty's clothes. 
But lot', 
I 
don't mind it, for when they " choose " to give me solitary, I 
" 
chews " my baccy, and when I 
comes out I'm in much better 
fettle to— 
Stand at ease, etc. 
Some would-be heroes talk and prattle 
'Bout what deeds they'd do in battle, 
But when they hear the cannon's rattle, 
They're the first to run; 
But I 
stick to our noble nation, 
Laugh to scorn capitulation; 
Behind a 
tree I 
take my station 
Till the battle's done! 
SPOKEN.—Yes, that's the hammer. 
Stand behind a tree 
where the bullets can't hit yer. 
You can see all that's going on 
without being hurt—that's what I 
always does—you don't get 
killed so soon, and you are able at some future time to— 
Stand at ease, etc.

THE FIVE O'CLOCK 'BUS. 
MY 
name it is Stokes, and at Putney I 
dwell, 
And on Tower Hill I've a 
warehouse as well ; 
I 
am a 
dry salter in quite a 
large way, 
A 
very dry salter I 
think I 
may say ; 
I 
always am down in the city at nine, 
And, unless I 
come home in the ev'ning to dine, 
My dear little wife really makes quite a 
fuss— 
So I 
soothe her by catching the " five o'clock ' bus," 
CHORUS. 
For the five o'clock ' bus 
There are thirteen of us, 
And we start from the bank in 
The five o'clock ' bus. 
The five o'clock riders are all city gents, 
Who talk about shares in the new three per cents. ; 
Each day the same lot of ,old gentlemen ride, 
And the five o'clock ' bus carries thirteen inside; 
One evening, when starting, depict our dismay, 
When our old conductor quite slyly did say, 
" 
Would any gent here like a 
lady to miss'? 
For there's one wants to go by the five o'clock ' bus.' 
For the five o'clock ' bus, etc. 
The old buffers smiled and the old buffers frowned, 
And then came some chaff about handing her round, 
For the five o'clock ' bus was so full, don't you see, 
It was plain she must ride on some gentleman's knee; 
The lady was pretty and young, it was clear, 
And so we all said, " Come and sit here, my dear." 
She giggled and blushed, and she might have done WW1, 
For she sat on my knee in the five o'clock ' bus. 
For the five o'clock ' bus, etc. 
I 
chatted and talked to the girl all the way, 
And slyly arranged I 
would meet her next day; 
But when I 
alighted and rang at the bell, 
I 
found the young woman was waitinu as well; 
I 
shook in my shoes with a 
horrible doubt-7--
I 
feared she had come there to let it all out; 
13ut my wife, when she saw us, said, " Very odd, Gus, 
Here's our new servant come by the five o'clock 'bus.' 
For the five O'clock ' bus, etc.

THF. 
FIVE O'CLOCK 'BUS .—Continued. 
Now I 
can never look that young girl in the face, 
For if she but tells 1 
shall get in disgrace; 
I 
am chaffed all the way till I 
reach my abode, 
For, somehow, the story's got known on the road; 
Then, old city gentlemen, be careful, please, 
And don't let a 
young lady sit on your knees, 
Or you'll have to put up with the chaff and the fuss, 
low about the young girl and the five o'clock ' bus. 
For the five o'clock, ' bus, etc. 
I WISH THAT I COULD FLY. 
I 
ONCE was very happy, but I'm now so very sad; 
My disappointment is so great it nearly drives me mad; 
A mountain maid who lives in Wales, a 
Gipsey girl so fair, 
Quite won my heart last summer, when I 
happened to be there. 
CHORUS. 
T 
only wish that I 
could take and fly. fly, fly! 
Up on the mountain tops so high, high, high! 
My life would be all honey, ' cos I'd take up all my money, 
And along with Jenny Jones I'd live and die, die, (lie 
I 
sauntered out one morning, when this Gipsey girl I 
spied! 
" 
Oh ! let me tell your fortune, sir," the little darling cried ! 
I 
said, " Fair maid, what's thy name'?" when in angelic tones 
She said, " I 
live upon the hills, and my name's Jenny Jones." 
I 
only wish, etc. 
I 
felt enraptured, kissed her hand, when lo! a 
man came near, 
And swore he'd shoot me if again he ever caucht me there ; 
He tore the maiden from my arms, and then to her said, " Come, 
Leave that half cranky tourist there ; go to thy mountain home." 
I 
oniy wish, etc. 
So now she vanished from my 
have no wish to live; 
My wealth, ' tis almost twenty pounds, unto the poor Ill give ; 
My furniture, one wooden stool, unto my brother will; 
1'11 turn a 
hermit, build a 
hut, and live on Primrose Hill. 
I 
only yisli, etc.

OE, they sail away so gayly, 
When our youth was in the prime! 
And we watch their coming daily 
From the fair enchanted climc, 
From the fair enchanted clime, 
They will bring us endless treasures 
From the mines beyond the main ; 
They will bring us fame and pleasures 
We are sighing for in vain. 
They are sailing, they are sailing, 
O'er the ocean's pearly foam, 
And our joy will be unfailing 
When our wand'ring ships come home! 
And our joy will be unfailing 
When our wand'ring ships come home! 
Tho' our ships may haply perish 
In the lone, deceiving waver 
And the hopes we fondly cherish 
Follow them to gloomy graves, 
Follow them to gloomy graves! 
Time but leaves us where it found us, 
Waiting for them on the shore, 
While the simple joys around us 
We are losing ever more. 
They are sailing, they are sailing, 
O'er the ocean's pearly foam, 
And our joy will be unfailing 
When our wand'ring ships come 'home! 
And our joy will be unfailing

Musk by J. It. THOMAS. 
Ou, sing again! that song of thine 
Hath wakened mem'ries old and dear, 
And bringeth joy unto my heart, 
Though 
from mine eye there falls a 
tear. 
Each word and tone recalls the time 
When I, in childhood's ignorance, 
Dreamed life WiLi bliss. 
Alas, its cares 
Soon rudely broke that glowing trance! 
Oh, sing again ! that song of thine 
Hath wakened mem'ries old and dear, 
And bringeth joy unto my heart, 
Though from mine eye there falls a 
tear. 
Oh, sing again ! that gentle strain 
Has charmed my weary heart from woe; 
The present fades, the past is mine, 
With all the joys of long ago. 
The tones of friends delight my ear, 
And loving arms az e 
round me pressed; 
With musical accord, again 
Sweet hopes and joy thrill o'er my breast. 
Oh, sing again ! that song of thine 
Hath wakened mem'ries old and dear, 
And bringeth joy unto my heart, 
Though from mine eye there falls a 
tear. 
Oh, sing again! and let me hear 
The strains I 
loved in days of yore; 
Thy voice seems like an echo sweet 
Of tones I'll hear on earth no more. 
Oh, sing ! and should I 
weep the while, 
My tears will not from sorrow flow, 
For oh, thy strains with mem'ries teem 
Of friends and joys of long ago. 
Oh, sing again! that song of thine 
Hath wakened menfries old and dear, 
And bringeth joy unto my heart, 
Though from mine eye there falls a 
tear.

IT

One Sunday afternoon— 
All dressed to kill from head to heel, 
Such a 
handsome little coon. 
When I 
seed de gals, my hat I 
raised, 
And how de white folks stared; 
Dar's little Bob, de nobby soul, 
Out on a 
promenade. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, I 
was slamenading around promiscusly, when 
my ' tention was Vacted away by one of de lubliest animiles I 
eber bad the opportunity of gazing upon. 
It was a

de sweetestest waterfalls, and innocent mouth, and more of it 
dun any gal I

All dressed to kill I 
see her still, 
Leaning on de winder sill; 
She winked her eye as I 
passed by, 
Haugh ! it tickled me so I 
liked to die. 
I 
passed her on a 
block or so, 
But could not stay away; 
She shook her handkerchief after me, 
Which signified 0. K. 
She smiled so sweet when me did meet, 
I 
thought dat I 
should fly; 
It tickled me so when she asked me in, 
0, golly, I 
liked to die. 
SPOKEN.—But I 
declare to goodness I 
mustn't say much 
more about it, or I 
get to laughing so I

All dressed to kill, etc. 
It's just about a

Since what I 
told transpired; 
I 
asked her, please won't you be mine ? 
Says she, " it' you desire." 
We're going to be married soon, 
You must be sure to be there; 
And I'll introduce you all around, 
To the fairest of the fair.

KNOI.V A MAID WHO LOVES ATTI. 
Written by Wm. H. D ELEICAN TY. 
I 
KNOW a 
maid who loves me, 
And has my heart in keeping, 
And every day she proves me 
Her love to me is leaping—. 
Like dews of summer weeping, 
In tears the bud-rose steeping. 
CHORUS . 
Sweet Emma's of my life a 
part, 
The sunshine of my eye, 
The love I 
feel within my heart, 
Can never change nor die. 
But if you chance to meet her, 
IIer grace and beauty charming, 
Will make you fondly greet her 
With admiration warming— 
The heart of love alarming, 
But wishes free of harming. 
Sweet Emma's, etc. 
Had'st thou but heard her talking, 
Thine all attention given, 
Or by her side been walking 
That lovely summer even', 
While zephyrs flower-breath laden 
Made earth seem part of heaven. 
Sweet Emma's, etc. 
But dread the bitter ending, 
If when by her deserted, 
Bereft her sweet befriending, 
'Twere better death had started 
His round, nor leave thee parted, 
Forever broken hearted.

LITTLE DEW DROP. 
Written and Composed by Wm. H. DELErreacTir. 
Now everybody wonders I'm so happy_ 
They criticize my gay and airy style, 
But if they knew the pretty little beauty 
That threw at me the sweetness of her smile, 
I'm sure they wouldn't wonder I 
was airy, 
Nor think that I'm in any way to blame, 
When I 
say I 
gave my heart up to a 
fairy— 
Yes, " Little Fairy Dew Drop" is her name. 
CHORUS . 
Oh ! yes, she's like a 
fairy, 
Blithesome and airy— 
pouting lips of cherry, 
Smiling when we meet. 
Bright eyes when they view me, 
Piercing thro' and thro' me, 
Perfectly under me, 
Dew Drop is so sweet. 
One summer's day we went a- picking berries, 
So ripe and running wild upon the hill, 
how carelessly we trod upon the daisies, 
So anxious were we then the pail to fill ; 
And when the pail was full we sat and rested, 
'Twas just because I 
said she needed rest— 
And oh! how very sweet the bei ries tasted 
With little Dew Drop leaning on my breast. 
Oh ! yes, etc. 
I 
told her then my life was very lonesome, 
And bluntly asked her would she he my wife, 
And tho' I 
said, I 
knew I 
wasn't handsome, 
Still, I 
hoped with love to bless her all her life ; 
She answered " yes," when we were homeward turning, 
Thro' fields where corn was waving high above, 
While I 
think to bug or kiss we were a- learning, 
And no one heard our gentle tale of love. 
Oh ! yes. etc.

IRISH COURTSHIP. 
A COMIC DUET. 
As Sung by THE FIELDING& 
He— I'VE come far over the hills, 
My colleen for to see; 
The moon is up in the sky, 
I 
wonder where she can be ? 
Thn Rooney, the bog-trotting elf, 
To my Mary did propose, 
If I 
catch him at it again, 
I'll break his ugly nose. 
Enter M ARY ; L. II. 
She—My Pat is standing there, 
lie's waiting too for me, 
The finest lad is he, 
From the Liffy to the sea. 
I 
love him so dearly too, 
But my brain in anger whirls, 
When I 
see him at the fair, 
Kissing the other girls. 
He—Ah I 
there you are, my dear, 
It is yourself I 
see. 
She—Now, plaze your distance kape 
Go talk to Biddy McGee ; 
I 
saw you at the fair, 
With your arm around her waist. 
Ile—You mustn't mind that, darling, 
It's only an Irishman's taste. 
She—I'm glad you told me that, 
Your taste is mighty fine, 
Her nose it does turn up, 
And in one eye she is blind, 
ire—But the other one is good, 
With such a 
winning lurch ; 
She—Her tongue it runs as. fast, 
As the clock in the village church.

IRISH COURTSHIP.—Continued. 
He—But she has lots of pigs, 
Which is quite good you know, 
She— She's got a 
hump on her back, 
And her legs bend like a 
bow; 
He—She's forty pounds in the bank, 
Perhaps a 
pound or two more. 
She—Her mouth runs from ear to ear, 
As big as the chapel door. 
lie—But, Mary has a 
snug cabin. 
She—Well, haven't I, you spooney ? 
He—But yours you know, Mary, 
Has been ax'd by Tim Rooney; 
She—Do you think it's the likes of him, 
That could get the likes of me, 
I 
hate that spalpeen as bad, as— 
Re—You do poor Biddy McGee. 
He—Mary, there's one thing I 
think, 
Will surely plaze your taste, 
Just put your arm in mine, 
And let's go unto the praste ; 
She—Is it the truth, you're spaking now, 
Or my feelings wish to try '1— 
ile—Let's get married now, darling,

Written and Sung by THE FIELDINGS 
ARRAH, blud-a-nounker, dears, 
Arrah, musha, man alive, 
Sure you all can see, 
That we have just arrived, 
From where Patrick he was born, 
Betwixt daylight and morn, 
OuId Ireland's the place I 
mean. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, we are an Irish pair, 
An Irish pair 
From the County of Kildare, 
At a 
wake, a 
dance, 
A 
fight or a 
fair, 
We're always to be found. 
Shure Ould Ireland is the place, 
For a 
row or a 
wake, 
If you're not mighty shy, 
Shure they'll blacken up your eyes, 
So look out, me boys, 
,If you're not on the right side, 
For the divil is to pay 
When sticks they let fly. 
Yes, we are, etc. 
I WONDER WHAT'S HER NAME. 
A 
new Song and Dance, written by T. M. II kNOLER. 
THERE is a 
darling gay and sweet, 
I 
meet her every day, 
She has a 
cunning, winning smile, 
And such a 
charming way; 
Each time I 
chance to pass her by, 
She always smiles the same ; 
She dresses neat and so complete, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
Oh, she is so neat and so complete, 
She always smiles the same, 
I'd give the world if I 
knew, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
(Repeal.) 
Last eve her elbow mine did touch, 
While standing in a 
throng, 
But quickly I 
apologized, 
And said, I 
mean no wrong; 
No harm, she said, for accidents, 
Like that are very tame, 
And then she left with a 
pretty smile, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
Oh, she, etc. 
Perhaps to-night she's in the crowd, 
That has assembled here, 
With all my friends please look around, 
And find this pretty dear ; 
If here, whoever points her out 
I'll not the slightest blame; 
Oh, tell me where this davlin 1. is, 
I 
wonder what's her lame. 
Oh, slue, etc.

Tun moon is out to-night, love, floating through the sky, 
The little stars are laughing as she passes by, 
All the little songsters sing their pretty tune, 
Happy as they can be singing to the moon. 
Clouds of silver lining waiting in the sky, 
For the moon to pass them; Jessie, so am I. 
For I've come to meet you with a 
happy smile, 
To tell you how I 
love you, sitting on the stile. 
CrIORIIS. 
The moon is out to-night, love, meet me with a 
smile, 
I've something sweet to tell you, sitting on the stile; 
Kiss me when you meet me, Jessie of the Glen, 
And when I 
go to leave you I'll give it back again, 
The moon is out to-night, love, all the roses blush, 
When the gentle night winds tell the birds to hush, 
For I 
want to listen for a 
merry voice, 
Whose every note is music, and makes my heart rejoice; 
Jessie, I 
am watching to see if I 
can see 
Some one like a 
fairy coming towards me; 
Ah the little angel coming once again, 
I've a 
kiss of true love for Jessie of tLe Glen. 
The moon is out, etc. 
I'm going to get (lima, Norah, 
Pray.

Sure to-day it is the Seventeenth, 
The day we celebrate, 
In honor of St. Patrick, 
Old Ireland's patron saint. 
CHORUS. 
On St. Patrick's Day, 
We'll march so gay-, 
Up the Bowery and down Broadway, 
If we don't have fun, 
The devil's to pay, 
On the Seventeenth of March 
This is the hat 
wear, 
And PH put on my false hair, 
And as we march together, 
The people they will say, 
There goes an Irish couple, 
That keep St. Patrick's day.

W E'VE got an awful malady the doctors cannot cure, 
There never was another case to equal us before; 
Our dad he scolds us up and down, but still it is no go, 
Our progress in the keep still line is most almighty slow. 
CHORUS. 
Now watch us sling our feet about, like magic how they fly, 
It is no use, we feel so loose, we must sing, dance or die. 
We've worn out all the carpets, and kicked up every floor, 
Our mamma says if we don't stop, we'll ruin her house for sure; 
She begs us for to hush that noise, and we to mind her try, 
But it's born in us, that you'll agree, to sing, dance or die. 
Now watch us sling our feet, etc. 
We're known among the village folks, as the kickywicksy kids, 
And all we care for in this world is the sounding of the this ; 
When we think of settling down to work it almost makes us cry; 
It's a 
settled fact of history, we must sing, dance or die. 
Now watch us sling our feet, etc.

When we left the ould sod, 
Where we worked in the bogs, 
Our father and mother did say: 
" 
Be honest and true, 
Awl God will be with you, 
When yes get to America." 
We told them that we would, 
And do all that we could 
To have them out here next May ; 
And we'll stick to our word, 
If we have to dig mud, 
At a 
dollar and a 
half a 
day. 
'Tis work, etc.
