PAT ROONEY'S SONGSTER. 
TO MY NUMEROUS AND KIND FRIENDS. 
Ix launchino, this, my trim little bark, upon the sea of popu-
lar favor, it may riot be out of place for me to give my reasons 
for so doing. 
As has been the case with many other successful singers, I 
have suffered from the fact that conceited persons have tried 
to imitate my various " make- ups," and styles of singing and 
dancing; and in doing so, have appropriated my songs and 
music—as far as their lack of ability would allow. 
In their 
unsuccessful imitations they mar the music and mutilate the 
language; substituting vulgarity for humor, nonsense for wit. 
I 
have, therefore, felt it a 
duty I 
owe to that kind public which 
have showered favors and plaudits upon my anxious and success-
ful endeavors to please them, to issue a 
correct version of all 
my leading songs. 
I 
have consequently selected the publisher 
of this work to place my productions in print, as his house is 
not only the most extensive, but the most reliable in the trade. 
I 
avail myself of this opportunity to heartily thank a 
gener-
ous public for the liberal encouragements they have always be-
stowed upon their much obliged servant,

I 
KEEP a 
saloon on the corner, my boys, 
And faith I've a 
flourishing trade ; 
I've brought out my cousin, Nathaniel Doyle, 
The money on whiskey I 
made. 
I 
could sell to you now a 
nice " Passe Caffay," 
Or a " Rhino Victoria." cigar ; 
No slate, chalk, or pencil, is kept in the house 
When Malone's at the back of the bar. 
CIIORITS. 
Tra In la, tra la la I 
When Malone's at the back of the bar. 
I 
never was stood up for brandy or beer. 
My rule is to never give " tick ," 
When a 
bum's at the store on a 
cold winter's morn, 
It's meself that is making a " kick." 
I 
set out a 
lunch on the table so neat, 
Fat herrings, presarved in a 
jar ; 
I'd cut off the hand of a 
snoozer, or vag, 
That grabs when I'm back of the bar. 
Tra la la, etc. 
The till I 
keep here in my pocket so safe, 
I 
light up my kerosene lamps ; 
At daylight I 
put up my shutters so tight, 
Then go in to count up my stamps. 
I'm open all day on a 
Sunday so gay, 
To the young girls I " tra la la la I" 
They'say as they pass by my window so sweet, 
Malone's at the back of the bar.

My name is Roger O'Malley, understand, 
And don't begin for to doubt me ; 
I 
own my own house, and a 
bit o' land, 
There's no common stock about me. 
I 
went to college when a 
boy, 
And left with heaps of lore ; 
And came out here to this free land, 
Just pravious to the war. 
Roger O'Malley, that's my name, 
Quite famous I 
have grown ; 
I'm far superior to Muldoon, 
Mulcahy, or Malone. 
I'm quite independent in my way, 
High-ton'd and well educated ; 
All my taxes 
ready for to pay, 
And I'm not in the least dissipated. 
I 
can take a 
drink, and smoke a 
cigar, 
With comfort and delight; 
But you'll never see me login' round 
The whiskey bars at night 
Roger O'Malley, etc. 
I'm as dacent a 
man as you can find, 
Like all my seven generations ; 
With a 
good deal of larnin' in my mind, 
Which I 
use on important occasions; 
I'm far above yer common scraps, 
That fling their names all round. 
And they'll not catch me in any traps, 
For I'm sensible and sound. 
Roger O'Malley, etc. 
I'm a 
marshal whenever we parade, 
I 
ride a 
horse from Araby.; 
With a 
big stick of honor in my hand, 
Sure, in martial affairs nun° baby. 
I 
ate my fill, and wear good clothes, 
Made up in the style you see ; 
.My walk is grand, and plainly shows 
That there's no such man as me I

I 
COM E with news to-night, Inc boys, 
Just heed me for awhile; 
My song will give delight, me boys, 
For it makes Inc grin and smile ; 
You've heard about that famous man 
Who left us all in pain ; 
Sure, he's back at last all safe and sound— 
Mulcahy's home again! 
CHORUS. 
Then shout, and cheer, and drink yer beer, 
No more in grief remain; 
For now the cry is ev'rywhere, 
Mulcahy's home again! 
I 
met him down in Chambers street 
A week ago to- day; 
And when I 
shook his friendly hand, 
Sure, I 
thought I'd faint away ! 
He's big and stout, and walks about 
In dress both nate and clan°; 
Says I 
with glee, " 0, can this be 
Mulcahy home again ? " 
Then shout, etc., 
I 
axed him why he strayed away, 
And left us all behind ; 
But diyil a 
word would he reply 
To satisfy me mind ; 
He may have lived in foreign lands— 
In Jarsey, or in Spain; 
But none will care from whence he came, 
When he's home with us again. 
Thee shout, etc. 
He talks no more of politics— 
He says he's had enough ; 
To stand their capers and their tricks 
One must be bold and touoh! 
He thinks he'll start a 
corner store, 
And paint a 
sign so plain, 
To greet us when we reach the door— 
" 
Mulcahy's Home Again I" 
Then shout, etc.

arian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
as on a 
Saturday night, 
That we started a 
Company, 
And elected Anthony Wright, 
Our Captain for to be ; 
He accepted office with thanks, 
And appointed us Pioneers 
For to march in front of the ranks, 
In the Hoolahan Musketeers! 
CHORUS. 
We march'd like soldiers thro' the streets, 
With our new flags flying so gay, 
And bate the time wid both our feet, 
While the baud did sweetly play; 
From windows high the girls did look, 
And they stniPd at the Pioneers, 
And then their handkerchiefs they shook, 
At the Hoolahan Musketeers. 
To the guests invited we gave 
All the prizes to carry round, 
And at nine o'clock we did lave, 
For to go to the shooting ground, 
Where we stopp'd for two hours or more, 
And we toasted the Pioneers, 
Had eating and drinking galore, 
Did the Hoolahan Musketeers ! 
We march'd, etc. 
But when we got back to the ward, 
It was then we felt light and gay, 
And our Captain flourishld his sword, 
While the crowd did lave the way ; 
At Monahan's we broke up then, 
And faith, we gave three hearty cheers 
For the officers and the men, 
In the Hoolahan Musketeers! 
We rnarch'd, etc.

MY 
name it is Mike Slattery, 
And from Ireland I 
came, 
And I've a 
son who's a 
big blackguard, 
And Terence is his name; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain, 
And he calls it a " super " and a " slang. 
Oh, my heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
CHORUS. 
He'll come rolling home in the morning, 
And he'll give the door the devil's own bang; 
Oh, my heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
When he came- home last Thursday night, 
Sure, I 
talked to him very nice ; 
When he said, " Old man, you're getting too fresh, 
And we'll soon have to put you on the ice." 
lie told the old woman for to take a 
drop, 
And to shut up giving him her slang ; 
Oh, her heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
he'll come, etc, 
Sure, be stands upon the corner 
From morning until night, 
And if the policeman says " move on," 
He'll spit at him with spite ; 
He went to the market only yerterday, 
there he stole a " wipe" and a " slarrg 
Now Wm 
got three months in the Penitentiary„ 
Along with the rest of the " gang."

BAD was the day, Erin, I 
bade thee good-bye, 
I 
left thee in sorrow, a 
tear in my eye ; 
Thy hills of pure em'rald, the pastures and plain 
Are sights, darling country, I'll ne'er see again ; 
A 
heart full of sadness, a 
heart that was sore, 
Was mine when I 
left thee to see thee no more ; 
But visions of all that I 
left there behind 
Are flitting so sweetly at times thro' my mind. 
CHORUS . 
Sad was the day, Erin, I 
bade thee good-bye, 
I 
left theein sorrow, a 
tear in my eye ; 
A country I've found that gives shelter to me, 
America; truly the land of the free. 
Sad was the day, Erin, I 
bade thee good-bye, 
And sad were my feelings when Norah did cry ; 
I 
left her, sweet jewel, a- waving her hand, 
As the ship shot away from my dear native land. 
She stood on the cliffs till the dark of the nighl, 
had shut the fast- sailing craft, out of her sight; 
Then to her small cabin she went, well I 
know, 
And wept did my darling, because I 
would go. 
Sad was the day, etc. 
Sad was the day, Erin ; I 
bade thee good-bye, 
But hard I 
will work, and much harder will try 
To bring the dear creature, the sweet little dove, 
My Norah, to this, now the land that I 
love ; 
The Irishman finds here a 
friend that is true, 
The Green waves aside of the Red, White, and Blue ; 
And all from the Emerald Isle of the sea 
Find welcome in this, the real home of the free.

A SKETCH FOR ONE CHARACTER. 
[Scene, a 
cabin. 
Enter TIM FLAHERTY, ,
singing or whist-
shoulder.] 
ling "The Girl I l
ef
t behind me. " Bundle and stick, on 
TIX—Bad luck to it, here I've been trotting over the bogs 
for the last week since I 
landed on me own native sod, and 
sorra a 
bit have I 
seen of the darlint I 
left behind me when I 
went over the say. 
I 
wonder where she hides her own pretty 
face. 
Sure, it's of her I've been dreaming since I 
sailed away 
in the big ship, night and day. 
I 
went over beyant to seek 
me fortune, and it's devil a 
fortune I 
was after finding at all at 
all. 
When I 
landed at Ca.stle Garden, devil a 
castle or a 
garden 
I 
found there; but a 
big chap sez to me " Can you work ?" 
sez he. " I 
can," sez I. " What at ?" sez he. " Anything," 
sez I. " All right," sez he ; 
I'll make a 
builder or an archi-
tect of ye," sez he. - " What's an architect ?" sez I. " Why," sez 
he. " thim's the boys that builds up the houses." Sure I 
thought 
me fortune was made. " Follow me," sez he. " I 
will," sez I; 
and away we went into an illeg,ant part of the city, I 
think 
they called it Baxter Street, and there I 
met me old friend, 
Tim Finnegan, who lives there. 
And he was an architect, 
too; and the first thing I 
knew after, I 
was breaking the 
small of me back going up a 
pair of stairs without any ban-
isters, and carrying a 
load of bricks. " Is this what you call an 
architect in this country ?" sez I. " It is," sez he. " Then I 
resign," sez I. " All right," se.z he. 
And here I 
am. 
I'll 
sing ye a 
song all about me own adventures. and then I'll go 
on me travels again, for I 
feel like the devil knows what till I 
see me own little Irish girl once more. 
Song 1.s played.

So I 
went to the court, and explained to the judge. 
He called me a 
pauper, a 
vagrant and loafer, 
And gave me six months in the island above.— Cho. 
So I 
shouldered my bundle, and homeward I 
wandered, 
Ould Erin for ever, oh, she is my joy I 
It's here I'm at home, and never will roam, 
For she's good enough for a 
rale Irish boy. 
Sure, there's whiskey galore, just here by the door. 
And beauties you ne'er can find afar o'er the sea; 
And the girls are so pretty, so nate and so witty, 
And that's just what suits the lad, Tim Flaherty.— Cho.

And bright as the fresh morning dew, 
They speak of a 
heart full of gladness, 
A 
love that is tender and true; 
They sparkle like purest of di'monds, 
They twinkle like stars in the skies, 
And nothing to me is fairer to see 
Than my Kathleen's beautiful eyes.

And bright as the fresh morning dew, 
They speak of a 
heart full of gladness, 
A 
love that is tender and true. 
Oh, blue are the eyes of my Kathleen, 
And firm as the old em'rald isle, 
They tell me that one darling creature 
To me will be true all the while; 
They glisten like dear little sunbeams 
That fall from the clear summer skies, 
And nothing I 
see is dearer to me 
Than my Kathleen's beautiful eyes. 
Oh, blue, etc. 
Oh, blue are the eyes of my Kathleen, 
And clear as the soft silver stream, 
They light up my heart with their brightness, 
And bring a 
relief in their gleam; 
They whisper to me of the future, 
When under the starry p,em'd skies, 
Mv darling will be united to me 
By my Kathleen's beautiful eyes. 
Oh, bloc, ctc.

started for the fair, 
With spirits light and hearty, 
Behind McCarthy's mare; 
Oh, it was a 
lively party! 
You never saw the likes of it, 
Believe me what I 
say ! 
Sure we had a 
roaring racket, 
But the mare she ran away. 
Off she wint ! off she wint! 
Be gob, I 
wasn't worth a 
cint ! 
The sate was jist as bard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Hould her in !" McCarthy cried; 
" 
Stop her!" says McCue; 
I 
thought I'd shake to pieces 
As along the road we flew ! 
Me bead was swimthing like a 
top, 
My heart was in despair, 
The divil himself was in the wheels 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
McCarthy held the reins, 
And Murphy held McCarthy, 
But whiskey filled their brains, 
And made them wild and hearty ; 
Maloney tumbled out behind, 
And there we let him lay— 
Sure I 
offered to assist him, 
But the mare she ran away. 
Off she wint ! off she wint! 
Be gob. I 
wasn't worth a 
cint ! 
The sate was jist as hard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
" 
Hould her in !" etc. 
THE RUNAWAY MARE.—Coneluded. 
Me dacent coat was tore, 
Me hat was left behind me; 
I 
rattled and I 
swore, 
And. I 
thought the dust would blind me ; 
In holes and ditches whit the wheels-
0, murther! such a 
day ! 
Sure mesilf was kilt intirely, 
With the mare that run away. 
OW she wint ! off she wint! 
Be gob, I 
wasn't worth a 
cint! 
The sate was jist as hard as fl:nt, 
Behind McCarthy's mare.

SEE how fast from heaven, mother, 
Fall the featlfry flakes of snow, 
Weaving white and pure a 
mantle 
For the fruitful earth below ; 
Ere they melt I'll leave you, mother, 
Leave for e'er this world of pain; 
Something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flow'rs again. 
Do not weep, dear loving mother, 
Sad am I 
to cause you pain ; 
But something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flow'rs again. 
How I 
lov'd alone to wander 
In the happy days long flown, 
O'er field and meadow fair, to gather 
Bright-hued blossoms freshly blown ; 
Soon beside the rippling river, 
Winding onward o'er the plain. 
The buds will burst, but I 
shall never 
See the summer tiow'rs again. 
Do not weep, etc.

lin go back to Erin, to Erin, deer Barney, 
I'm sighing, my dearest, for one glance at you ; 
I 
long for the borne of the dear little shamrock, 
The mountain and meadow that sparkle with dew. 
Since last I 
beheld you my heart has been weary, 
I've thought of you, darling, by night and by day ; 
And often in dreams I 
have tried to caress you, 
And you, my dear Barney, so far, far away. 
Ah! I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
I 
cannot, I 
cannot no longer delay ; 
I 
long for the home of the dear little shamrock, 
And, Barney, my love, 
be soon on the way. 
I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
I'm longing for you and those bright auburn curls; 
I 
sigh for the scenes of the past in our village, 
The valleys. the rivers, and rosy-check'd girls. 
The lakes of Killarney are shining before me, 
Their sweet, placid waters are bright as of yore ; 
And often I 
think I 
am wanin2 beside you, 
And talking- of love by the lake's pleasant shore. 
Ah ! I'll go back, etc 
TU cl'o back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
So, darling, be ready to welcome me there ; 
I 
1,ok for the day when we'll fix- for the wedding, 
The marriacre that makes us the happiest pair. 
The lark and the cuckoo will 7reet my arrival, 
The nightingale, too, will respond with a 
lay ; 
And Barney, remember, be ready to meet me, 
For Barney, my love, 
be soon on the way. 
Ah 
I'll go back.

crave your condescension, 
And we'll tell you what we know 
Of marching in the Mulligan Guards 
From the seventh ward below; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey— 
A Tipperary man— 
tle carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
CHORUS. 
We shouldered guns, 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the Connernarro pet, 
With the rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red, boys, 
To show where we came from ; 
Our guns we'd lift, 
With the right shoulder shift, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We shouldered, etc. 
When we'd get home at night, boys, 
The divil a 
wink we'd sleep; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of whiskey, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
" 
And march in the Mulligan Guard. 
We shouldered, ete.

THE hero of my bumble song 
Was once a 
mighty man, 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood, 
And chief of all his clan; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
CHORUS. 
He was great and grand, and took command 
Of the boys on Patrick's day; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away. 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too! 
Sure many a 
time for nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue ; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And now he's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor; 
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
Ho thought it bright and fair;

1YIULCATIY'S GONE AWAY. — Continued. 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
His mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But lie lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
He treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to his feet; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display ; 
He was a 
most distinguished man— 
But now he's gone away! 
He was great, etc,. 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man ; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and say— 
Oh, what'll we do at all, at all I 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, etc.

WE are privates in the S:xty-Ninth, 
We follow up the fife and the drum; 
We can't forget our old comrades, 
And their glory at Bull Run. 
It was there with bayonets bristling, 
In the thickest of the fray, 
Where the shot and shell were wh.stling, 
Our boys help'd gain the day. 
CHORUS. 
We march behind the band, 
True sons of Paddy's land, 
The Irish boys for style are excellent; 
The green above the red, 
With martial step we tread, 
In the gallant Sixty- Ninth Regiment. 
They admit we are the ladies' pride, 
When we're out for a 
grand review, 
They shout huzza from near and fa!, 
At our Irish boys so true ; 
With columns solid as a 
wall, 
Bright uniforms neat and clean, 
We are one anl all sons of Erin, 
From the land of the Shamrock green. 
We march, etc. 
Should America call on her soldier boys, 
To the front we'd boldly go ; 
For a 
righteous cause, our Nation's laws, 
Give battle to the foe. 
Well ne'er forget old Ireland, 
But keep our powder dry, 
" 
Faug,h a 
ballag,h " our cry, clear the way, 
To conquer or to die.

Music by DAVID BRAHLIC. 
THREE years ago this very day 
We went to Governor's Isle, 
For to stand forninst the cannon. 
In true military style. 
Seventeen American dollars 
Each month we surely get 
For to carry a 
gun and bagnetts 
With a 
regimental step. 
We had our choice of going 
To fhe army or to jail; 
Or it's up the Hudson river 
With a " copper " take a 
sail;, 
Oh, we puckered up our courage, 
Wid bravery we did go; 
Oh, we cursed the day we went away 
Wid the Regular Army 0 ! 
CHORUS. 
There was Sergeant John McCaffery 
And Captain Donahue; 
Oh, they make us march and toe the mark, 
In gallant Company " Q." 
Oh, the drums would roll, upon my soul ; 
This is the style we'd go 
Forty miles a 
day, on beans and hay, 
In the Regular Army 0 ! 
We wint to Arizony 
For to fight the Injins there ; 
We came near being made bald-headed, 
But they never got our hair; 
We lay among the ditches, 
In the yellow dirty mud, 
And we never saw fu4 onion, 
A 
turnip, or a 
spud.

THE REGULAR ARMY 0 1
— Continued. 
Oh, we were taken prisoners, 
Conveyed fornist the chafe; 
Oh, he said we'll make an Irish stew, 
The dirty Indian thafe. 
On the telegraphic wire 
We walked to Mexico; 
We blessed the day we skipped away 
From the Regular Army 0! 
There was, etc. 
We've been dry as army herrings, 
And as hungry as a 
Turk; 
Oh, the boys along the street cry out, 
" 
Soger, would you work ?" 
We'd ship into the navy 
For to plow the raging sea, 
But cold water sure we couldn't endure, 
'Twould never agree wid me. 
We'll join the politicians, 
Then we know we'll be well fed; 
Oh, we'll sleep no more upon the ground, 
But in a 
feather bed, 
And if a 
war it should break out, 
They call on us to go, 
We'll get Italian substitutes 
For the Regular Army 0! 
There was, etc. 
We've corns upon our heels, my boys, 
And bunions on our toes; 
For lugging a 
gun in the red hot sun 
Puts freckles on your nose. 
England has its Grenadiers, 
France has its Zoo-zoos, 
The U. S. A. never changes they say, 
But continually wear the blues. 
When we are out upon parade, 
We must have our muskets bright, 
Or they'll slap us in the guard-house 
To pass away the night ; 
And whin we want a 
furlough, 
To the Colonel we do go; 
He says, go to bed, and wait till you're dead, 
k the Regular Army 0! 
There was. etc.

SAINT PATRICK was a 
gentleman, 
Sure his name we celebrate, 
And on the seventeenth of March 
The Irish concentrate ; 
A 
bran-new hat on each man's head, 
And a 
green necktie that's newly made; 
The left foot first, then lightly tread 
In the Patrick's day parade ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow, 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
CHORUS. 
We shout hurrah for Erin go bragh, 
And all the Yankee nation, 
Stars and stripes, and shamrock bright arrayed ; 
The Irish shout, the girls turn out, 
To see the celebration; 
We march stiff as starch, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
You should see the marshal on his horse, 
Like Napoleon Bonyparte, 
And as he rides along the line, 
He'd break each lady's heart, 
And if the rain should fall down then, 
We hoist our umbrellas high, 
For history states that Irishmen 
Are always warm and dry; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc. 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
And though I'm not a 
drinking man, 
On that day I'd drink my beer; 
I'll wear the shamrock in my hat; 
The green, my boys, ' twill never fade, 
And march along with Dan an' Pat, 
in the Patrick's day parade; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc.

MeGEE was a 
jolly old cobbler, 
lie came from the divil knows where 
Of whiskey, he was a 
great gobbler, 
And delighted to go on a " tare." 
He was often persuaded to alter 
His habits, and live like a 
man ; 
But whenever he tried, he would falter, 
And go back to his bottle and can. 
CHORUS . 
McGee was a 
terrible man, 
lie was always so flighty and frisky ; 
He tried to reform, but he couldn't keep warm, 
Sure, he'd die if he hadn't his whiskey. 
His wife was a 
dacent ould woman, 
And scolded from mornin' till night ; 
She told him he must be inhuman 
To be keeping them in such a 
plight. 
He would listen in scorn and derision, 
And drink just as much as before ; 
Till at length she gave out her decision 
To begin on a 
temperance war. 
She went to a 
temperance preacher 
And stated the case of McGee ; 
He promised to help the poor creature— 
" 
I'll go over next mornin'," says he. 
When he came, the old cobbler was roaring 
A 
song, with his glass in his hand ; 
'Twas the glass he was fond of adoring, 
And he seemed hardly able to stand ! 
McGee was, etc. 
" 
Dear Misther McGee," said his rev'rence, 
" 
I 
hope you will alter your ways ; 
I've come now to give you deliverance 
From the evil that's bliohtine- your days !" 
" ' Pon me sowl!" says McGee, " I 
am ready, 
stop with the greatest of cheer ; 
But I 
fear I 
can never be steady 
While a 
dhrop of good whiskey is near." 
McGee was, etc. 
A TERRIBLE EXAMPLE.—Concluded. 
" 
Fear not," said the man of cold water, 
" 
You'll show us how good you can be 
The demon of drink we will slaughter, 
And we'll honor the name of McGee." 
Then he promised to keep at a 
distance 
All drinks of whatever degree ; 
" 
Noble man, you shall have our assistance— 
In a 
week the result we will see." 
McGee was, etc. 
SPOKEN. — The reverend gentleman, after some further per-
suasions, took his departure, and Mr. McGee at once became a 
strict disciple of temperance. 
The sudden change of life had a 
severe effect upon him ; he lost all his exuberant spirits, be-
ing entirely under the control of his wife and the temperance 
advocates, who filled his mind every day with solemn lectures, 
and worked him into such a 
queer state—half comfort, half de-
spair— that he would often say to himself, " Begot), I'm net 
meself at all !" 
At last they induced him to state in a public 
meeting the various benefits he had derived from his adherence 
to the pledge— the comfort, the happiness, the great joy and 
peace of mind he had experienced during his short season of 
sobriety. 
He attended the meeting, and with a 
very grave 
countenance, related his experience as follows: 
REC ITATION. 
Good people, I 
stand here before you to-night, 
Me mouth very dhry, and me head very light ; 
It's three weeks to-day since I 
joined in the ranks 
Of the Wather Brigade, I 
left off me ould pranks! 
And ever since Hon, sure, me life has been blessed 
With a 
great many comforts, and nights of good rest. 
I 
paid all me debts, and I 
bought a 
new gown 
For the wife of me bosom—a 
beautiful brown— 
I 
took from the pawn shop me loin Sunday coat, 
Which cost me last winter a 
ten dollar note, 
And put a 
new sole on the ould woman's shoes— 
A weighty big job, for she wears " twinty-two's 
I 
made a 
new sty for the fine little pigs, 
And fixed up the garden with bushes and twigs ; 
I 
wint to a 
lawyer and made out my will, 
My duty to all I 
was bound to fulfill. 
And yesterday mornin' ( don't think that I'm scoffin'), 
I 
bought for me body an litigant coffin ! 
For I 
know if my whiskey is taken from me, 
You'll very soon make a 
dead man of McGee. 
McGee was, etc.

Chorus. 
gen - tie - man, 
that's what I want 
to 
know ? 
Some look down on an Irishman, as if they thought that we 
Could not but helpless dolts or fools e'er have a 
hope to be; 
What matters where a 
man is born—I 
see in Erin's Isle 
There's lots of native gentlemen to greet you with a 
smile ; 
For there's other kinds of gentlefolks, besides a 
dandy beau, 
Then, why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman, that's what I 
want to 
know ?— Cho. 
You cannot give the reason why, I 
see it in each phiz, 
That Paddy's not a 
gentleman, because you know he is; 
He's always good to help a 
friend, although his means are scant, 
And if he's fond of blarney—be hates deceit and cant ; 
His coat may be of common frieze, his heart won't freeze, oh ! no; 
Then why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman, that's what I 
want to 
know ?—eho. 
If an Englishman's a 
gentleman, oh ! woorrahi then it's true, 
As Pat is John Bull's brothe., then he must be one too; 
Just read the Irish history, and in that same you'll find 
Great deeds of Irish gentlemen, St. Patrick's one, d'ye mind ; 
And don't forget this, ye who sneer at honest Paddy's worth 
That actions make the gentleman, no matter what the birth. 
Cho. 
Amu.—" Mulcahy's Gone Away." 
You have heard them sing of a 
hero bold, 
Mulcahy was his name, 
And, faith, he had a 
sister too, 
Was noted for her fame; 
She was chief cook in a 
boarding house, 
And at making hash was great; 
She came from the County Dynegole, 
And her maiden name was Kate. 
She is tall and thin, 
With her crooked shin ; 
Her cheeks was red, and so was the head 
Of Mulcahy's sister Kate. 
She treats me like a 
lady 
When her I 
go to see ; 
She takes me into the kitchen, - 
And treats me to cake and tea, 
And °Mimes I 
used to sit until 
It was very late, 
And whisp'ring my love story to 
Mulcahy's sister Kate. 
She is tall, etc. 
I 
thought she was an angel 
When I 
kept her company ; 
But in the course of time I 
found 
That she was fooling me ; 
I 
went to her house one night, 
And standing by the gate, 
I 
saw a 
greasy soapfat man 
A-hugging my darling Kate. 
She is tall, etc. 
THE GIRL FROM KILDARE. 
A IR.--" Bold Jack Donohoe." 
I Am a decent Irish girl, 
As you can plainly see ; 
Sure I 
have come from Ireland, 
And I 
crossed the briny sea; 
My husband he deserted me, 
And left me here in despair; 
But I 
am a 
decent Irish girl 
From the County of Kildare. 
When I 
did land in New York, 
It was on a Sunday morn; 
The weather it was very cold, 
I went to get a born, 
I went into a tavern, 
And, boys, what do you think ? 
That in New York on Sunday morn 
I 
couldn't get a 
drink. 
SHAKE THE DICE.1 
IT 
is eight years to- day that I 
came across the sea, 
And left Limerick town behind me ; 
Sure, the boys all kinds of tricks on me do play; 
Now I 
never get mad, now mind ye; 
They do call this a 
dice, and a 
queer six too, 
But time isn't like it used to be, 
But it is mighty aggravating upon Saint Patrick's Day 
For to have the blackguards bawlin' after me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, not for the world 
Would I part with this elegant hat, 
And the boys still cry with the top of their voice, 
" 
Are you ever going to shake that dice 7 " 
This hat was made in the County of Galway, 
And 
not ashamed for to wear it; 
But as down the street I 
go stones at me the blackguards throw, 
And all does call me a 
Paddy; 
It's proud I 
am of that, you can see that ; 
If the blackanards would only let me be; 
But it's mighty aggravating upon Saint Patrick's Day 
For to have them bawlin' after me. 
Oh, not for the world, etc. 
Now, me kind friends, if you listen, 
Sure Pat Rooney, that's me name, 
And the very same that I 
was christen'd, 
When lately from old Ireland I 
came; 
Oh, it's when I 
landed in this city, 
Sure I 
knew not what to do at all, 
But some folks, they thought themselves witty, 
Why, they told me to go hire a 
ball. 
Ah, I 
don't understand any of those Yankee words, 
For every one at me they bawl; 
If I 
dance, if I 
sing, if I 
do anything, 
Why, they tell me to go hire a 
hall. 
I 
went and joined a 
temp'rance society, 
And it's then that I 
felt quite content ; 
They saw I 
was full of sobriety, 
Sure, they elected me their president; 
I 
got up for to address the meeting, 
They all swore I 
ought to be blackball'd, 
Sure, I 
spoke for one hour and sixty-five minutes, 
When they told me to go hire a 
hall. 
Ab, I 
don't understand, etc.. 
Now it's about time that I 
crack it aisy, 
Or else with me you will all grumble, 
And I 
hope, me kind friends, I 
did plase ye, 
'Pon me sowl, I've taken a 
tumble, 
But there's one thing I'll say before I 
go away, 
And don't think that I 
have a 
gall ; 
If you've money to lend, why, then I'll amend, 
I'll straightway go and hire a 
ball. 
Ali, I 
don't understand, etc. 
PEG OF MULLINGAIL 
Ant.—" Little Jessie." 
I 
AM going to sing to you about my Peggy, 
A 
bright-eyed Irish queen ; 
She is the girl that I 
left behind me 
In that little Isle so green ; 
Last week I 
got a 
letter, in which she went to state 
If I 
did not forget her that she woukl emigrate ; 
Oh, how I 
wish that she would only come here, 
And be my guiding star, 
For fairer than an angel 
Is my Peg of Mullingar. 
CHORUS. 
For my heart it keeps a 
thumping, 
With joy I'm always jumping ; 
I'm anxious for to see my little beauty ; 
For the day's not distant far 
When I 
will be united 
To Peg of Mullingar. 
You may talk about your dandy Yankee ladies, 
With their fol-de-dols and pretty golden hair ; 
But with my pretty little dark- eyed beauty 
There is none that can compare. 
And when she does come over, to the Far West we will go, 
And there we'll live in clover, in the State of 0-hi-o. 
Now all I 
ask is that you won't forget me, 
When from you I'm distant far, 
For I 
know that I'll be happy 
With my Peg of Mullingar. 
For my heart, etc. 
WHEN THE AUTUMN LEAVES ARE 
FALLING. 
W ords by J. E. CARPENTER, Ese. 
W HEN the autumn leaves are falling, 
And the flowers have lost their prime, 
And the bird to his mate is calling 
To soar to a 
brighter clime, 
The heart that is bow'd by sorrow 
Now sinks in a 
deeper gloom ; 
For we know that the coming morrow 
Must wither some lingering bloom. 
For we know that the coming morrow., 
Must wither some lingering bloom. 
When the shadows of ev'ning lengthen, 
And we muse o'er each present grief, 
The hopes that we strive to strengthen, 
We feel, like our joys, are brief; 
And the leaves, as they fall around us, 
Remind us how short our span; 
That the flow'rs which the springtime found us 
But fade like the hopes of man. 
That the flow'rs which the springtime found us 
But fade like the hopes of man.

MY IRISH HOME ; 
OR, " DEAR ISLE OF THE SHAMROCK." 
Words by T. C. S. Coitus, M. D. 
Music by W ALTER BURNS. 
DEAR isle of the shamrock, where I 
lov'd to wander, 
And pluck hawthorn blossoms when hope's dream was young, 
Though far, far away, my heart daily grows fonder 
Of thy plaintive lays which so oft I've heard sung. 
Green, green be thy fields, happy home of my childhood; 
Thy daughters are pure and thy sons brave and free ; 
Fair land of the mountain, lake, round tow'r, and wildwood, 
Tho' now I'm an exile, my heart clings to thee. 
At morn when the sun thro' night's darkness is gleaming, 
And darting his rays from the east o'er the sea, 
Each stream of pure light that so brightly is beaming 
Seems wafting a 
message from Erin to me. 
Yet this western world with abundance is flowing, 
There's food for the poor and the weary find rest; 
But tho' nature's gifts all around me are growing, 
My old Irish home is the spot I 
love best.

MEsELF and Barney Casey whit to have a 
little spree, 
lie had a 
bottle for himself, and another one for me ; 
We thravell'd round the city till our heads and feet were sore, 
And ev'ry dhrink it was so nice, it made us wish for more. 
CHORUS. 
Bad luck to Casey's whiskey, it made us both so frisky, 
We dhrank our bottles empty, and at last we couldn't stand; 
Along the streets we rambled, we staggered and we scrambled, 
And sang a 
song, the whole night long, of gay ould Paddy's 
land. 
We met a 
big policeman, and he looked at us, says he, 
" 
What brings you out so late as this ?" says I, " the counthry's 
free ;" 
" 
Shut up," says Casey, " come along!" " 0, divil a 
bit," says I, 
" 
sthrike him jf he says a 
word, the durty mane ould spy." 
SPOKEN — And if Lever did sthrike him he might well say 
Bad luck to, etc. 
Ile turned around and left us—sure the man was not to blame, 
I 
called him back, and axed him if he'd plase to tell his name ; 
" 
Of coorse," says he, " it's Flanigan, I'm from the county 
Clare." 
" 
Hurroor says I, " shake hands, me b'y, our whiskey you must 
share !" 
Bad luck to, etc. 
Out kern the empty bottle, and I 
put it in his paw, 
" 
Look out," say he, " whin on me post, a 
dhrink's against the 
law." 
He put the bottle to his mouth, but divil a 
dhrop was there, 
And while we laughed at Flanigan, sure he began to swear I 
Bad luck to, etc. 
He raised his club above his head, and vow'd he'd take us in 
For dhrinking on the highway, " 0," says Casey, " that's too 
thin!" 
He dhragged poor Casey off to jail, and thried to take me too, 
But to keep a 
hoult on Casey was as much as he could do. 
SPOKEN.—I 
pitied poor Casey and I 
suppose he pitied me. 
But it was all his own doings. 
The two bottles fixed him. 
Bad luck to, etc.

DEAR OULD SOD . 
IT 
was down in Queenstown harbor, 
The mornina I 
set sail, 
My mammy cried to me, " Oh, John ; 
Your heart will never fail ; 
You're leaving poor old Ireland," 
My mother said to me; 
" 
Arrah, don't forget the dear ould sod 
Across tho deep blue sea." 
The boys and girls all ' round me 
Did shed the parting tear; 
My hungry eyes were fastened on 
The form to me so dear ; 
She waved her poor old withered hand, 
And cried out, " John machree, 
Arrah, don't forget the dear ould sod 
When you cross the deep blue sea." 
The very winds did sob and moan, 
As we put out to sea, 
A 
sad farewell to Ireland, growing, 
Dim upon our lee; 
But through my brain kept ringing still 
Her parting words to me— 
" 
Arrah, don't forget the dear ould sod 
When you cross the deep blue sea." 
When I 
landed in New York 
I 
felt both strange and queer; 
'Twas soon I 
had the money earned 
To bring the old mother here, 
And as she stepped upon the dock 
She cried, " Grah gin, machree, 
You didn't forget the dear ould sod 
When you cross'd the deep blue sea." 
The old dark days have passed and gone, 
"their grip no more we'll feel ; 
There's bread for every man who'll put 
His shoulder to the wheel; 
But while we're living here beneath 
The banner of the free, 
We'll ne'er forget the dear old sod 
Across the deep blue sea.

Then into IZoossia I 
have rushed, 
The laud of furs and capes, 
'The 111C11 all make the women work,

Then sailin' undl,er stars and stripe 
I

I'll never leave it more.

For the bosom of beauty itself miht expand, 
When bedeck'd by the Shamrock of Old Ireland; 
There's a

BOLD JACK DONOHOE.

The likes of Bold Jack Donohoe was not in this country, 
From maintaining of the peopie's laws, he fought so man-

Than to live in British slavery, says Bold Jack Donohoe 
With me hele kom hale, &c. 
Then never shall it yot be said, that O'Donohoe the brave,

She's ray rattling County Galway girl. 
You should se her on St. Patrick's days 
Preparing whisky for the tay, 
Her hair tied up in ribbons green, 
You'd think she was an Irish queen. 
Oh, could I

In true Irish style I'd her caress,

TITTI GALLOPP1NG'• HORSE ; 
OR, TERRY O'MULLIGAN. 
A broth of a 
boy—full of good humor and scientific knowledge. 
Written and composed by FREDERIC M AC CABE. 
On I 
my gallopping horse! 
Oh! my gallopping horse! 
I'm at home on the top of my gallopping horse! 
And I 
never can meet 
With a 
tune half so sweet 
As that made by the feet 
Of my galloping horse; 
'As there he goes prancing, 
And here he comes dancing, 
And rearing- and tearing so proudly and strong, 
It is so delightful, 
And makes me feel quite full 
Of daring, don't caring, while rushing along 
On my gallopping horse, 
On my gallopping horse, 
I'm at home on the top of ray ,gallopping horse; 
And I 
never can meet 
With a 
tune half so sweet 
As that made by the feet 
Of my gallopping horse. 
Oh I 
my gallopping horse! 
Oh I 
my F.,,allopping- horse! 
There was never his equal for mettle or force; 
lie's a 
spirited racer 
And bold steeple- chaser, 
My far-leaping-, hi ghfiyi11g, g,alloppina horse. 
He goes smashing and crashing, 
And splashing and dashing, 
Straight at a 
deep ditch, a 
rough fence, or high wall, 
Not badly though madly, 
All obstacles gladly, 
That come in his way, he goes full at them 
all. 
Oh! my gallopping horse, etc. 
Now I'll draw rein with reason, 
And just take my ease on 
The back of this wonderful gallopping horse; 
And I'll own I 
was wrong 
When I 
put it so strong-, 
That there wasn't his equal for mettle or force; 
THE GALLOPPING HORSE.—Continued. 
There is such another 
That makes as much bother 
In rearing and tearing as ever did mine; 
That prances as gladly, 
And dances as madly, 
And who's this nag's owner you'll never divine. 
On his gallopping horse, etc. 
Each man's hobby, of course, 
Is his galloping horse ; 
He believes there's no steed of such mettle or force • 
And when he's astride 
Of his hobby, he'll ride 
Just as wildly as I 
do on my hobby-horse ; 
If you ever endeavor 
To stop him, you'll never 
Succeed in persuading him out of his course. \ 
He thinks he's so clever, 
No logic whatever 
Can reason him down from his own hobby-horse.\ 
That's his gallopping horse, 
That's my gallopping horse, 
That's yours, mine, and every man's gallopping horse; 
And we never can meet 
With a 
tune half so sweet 
As that made by the feet of our own hobby- horse. 
BLOW GENTLY, WINDS, BLOW GENTLY. 
Written and composed by FREDERIC M ACC ARE. 
As I 
wander through the fields where the sweet flowers are 
growing, 
Or down in the meadow where the streamlet is flowing, 
I 
sing- that my love may come safe back to me— 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, while my love is on the sea ; 
For oh ! he is coming, coming back to me— 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, while my love is on the sea. 
Though the sky is fair and calm above, in sunlight brightly 
glowing, 
And through the softly waving trees the mildest breeze is blow-
ing, 
Far, far upon the ocean, ah! what storms may there not be— 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, while my love is on the sea; 
For oh ! he is coming, coming back to me— 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, while my love is on the we. 
THE OLD HAT. 
Written tend Composed by NED ItanainAN. 
Sung by HUGH MAGUIRE. 
Am.—" Going to the Mass last Sunday." 
Mr name is McNamarra. 
I'm an American cit-i-zan; 
I'm proud you know, 
Wherever I 
go, 
I'm a 
true born Irishman : 
There's one thing, me boys, I'd have you know, 
And I've come to tell ye that, 
It's the seventeenth of March, 
Whin, as stiff as starch, 
I 
parade with my old hat. 
citonus. 
For it's down Broadway I 
march so gay, 
Wid Cornelius, Barney and Pat— 
The people shout whin I 
turn out, 
And parade with my old hat. 
That hat was made in Dublin, 
in the year of ninety-eight; 
'Twas never called in and ye can't begin 
To say it's out of date. 
It's travelled the wide world over, 
From Ireland to Bombay, 
And the only time it can be seen 
is on St. Patrick's day. 
For it's down, etc. 
Thin give three cheers for the hat I 
wear, 
Before it is too late, 
And nine more cheers for Patrick's day, 
The day we celebrate. 
And when you see me on parade, 
l'il raise me hat to ye, 
invite ye all to come and call, 
And join my company. 
For it's down, etc. 
Come all ye boys of Paddy's land, who are inclined to roam, 
To reap the English harvest so far away from home, 
Be sure you're well provided with comrades bold and true, 
For you have to fight both day and night, 'gainst John Bull and 
his crew. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah, my boys, for Paddy's land, 
'Tis the land I 
do adore, 
May heaven smile on every child 
That loves that shamrock shore. 
When we left home for Dublin, tile morning it being clear, 
And when we got on board the boat, ne gave three hearty 
cheers, 
Saying: Good-bye, my boys, to that dear old land, we ne'er 
may see it more, 
For were going to fight, both day and night, all for that sham-
rock shore. 
Then hurrah, my boys, drc. 
We sailed away from Dublin Quay, and ne'er received a 
shock, 
Until we landed in New York, long side of the dock, 
Where thousands of our countrymen they were all in that town, 
And " Fagh a 
ballagh, clear the track I" were tile words that 
passed all round, 
Then away we went in merriment to drink I.ourhon and wine, 
Each lad he gave his favorite toast for the girl he left behind ; 
We sat and sang, made the ale-house ring, despi-ing Erin's 
foes, 
Or any man that hates the land, where St. P.itriek's shamrock 
grows. 
PAT O'BRIEN. . 
Pat O'Brien it is my name, I'll tell you, boys, from whence I 
came, 
OuId Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy; 
No country is so dear to me as the litstle Isle stands near the 
sea, 
Where all the boys are blithe and free, deny it if you can. 
Odd Ireland is the place where they're famed for fun 
mirth, 
It's equal can't be found if you search all o'er the earth; 
Good natured boys and girls are there, with none of them yss 
can compare. 
Where every heart is free from care, that makes an Irish bs3. 
cuoaus 
Pat O'Brien is my name, I'll tell you boys, from where I 
came. 
Ould Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy. 
Dan O'Connell, ould Ireland's friend, he struggled hard for to 
defend, 
Gainst all invaders who did intend to claim poor Paddy's land. 
He advocated Ireland's right with all his main and all his 
might, 
And he was poorly recompensed for all his toil and pains, 
in high courts of justice he caused them all to stare, 
With his knowledge, wit, and humor, to hear him it was rare ; 
He always proved poor Paddy's friend when to his trial he did 
attend, 
lie caused the noblest back to bend to the honest Irishman. 
Pat O'Brien, ck-c. 
In eighteen forty-four gone by, our countrymen they had to fly, 
For famine stared in every eye along ould Ireland's shore; 
They to America did sail, leaving their wives and babies to 
wail; 
They were determined not to fail, but their hardships endure. 
The harp that once through Tara's Halls, shall strike each chord 
again, 
To welcome back those called from across the raging main, 
May peace and plenty ever be to our little Isle that stands near 
the sea, 
and. all our toasts be, Ireland free ! and you'll be happy then. 
Pat O'Brien, & c.

THE HAT ME PATH-RR WORE. 
Composed by DANIEL M CCARTY, and given by him to JOHNNY Rolm, am 
a 
token of respect. 
Ala.—" Irish Molly, 0 
I" 
Pm Paddy Miles, an Irish boy, just come across the sea; 
For singing or for dancing, boys, I 
think that I'll please ye; 
I 
can sing and dance with any man, as I 
did in days of yore, 
And on Patrick's day I 
love to wear the hat me father wore. 
CHORUS. 
It's old, but it's beautiful—the best you ever seen; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so green. 
From my father's great ancestors it descended with galore— 
It's a 
relic of old dacency, is the hat me father wore. 
I 
bid you all good evening—good luck to you, I 
say, 
And when I 
cross the ocean I 
hope for me you'll pray; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Ballyinore, 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's land with the hat me father 
wore. 
It's old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see, 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and more, 
And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat me father wore. 
It's old, etc.

'Tis I

THE BUGABOO, 
As Sung by JERny BARRINGTON. 
COME all ye tender-hearted boys, wherever you may be, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardships, my boys, that I went 
through,* 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys, on board of the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
The day when first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal : 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never 
shall : 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plough the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of Richmond barracks so 
true,* 
When the gallant 84th fired a 
royal salute of bricks at the cap-
tain of the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We. sailed three years when a storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark blue 
sky, 
So the second mate gave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—he set 
fire to the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When the captain found what he had done, he loud for help did 
shout, 
He called up through the chimney- top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out; 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so hard through the middle of the turf, 
they couldn't save the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When fifteen thousand miles from land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so hard one night, that it couldn't burn any-
more; 
So the captain he gave orders to lower the boats and save the 
crew,*

Now, Mr. Pat, do you moind that,

About blarneying to me.

But you can't play that on me. 
PAT.—Oh, Kitty, if you don't have me, 
My poor ould heart will break ; 
KITTY.— Oh sure if you're as bad as that 
Go home, and something take.

All for the sake of you.

PAT'S TRIP TO AMERICA. 
Sung by TONT PASTOR. 
AIR.—" New Policeman." 
I 
LEFT my native shore in May, 
A 
steamship swept me through the ocean 
Of mighty thundering hills of say, 
Of which dear people you've no notion. 
The thunders howled, the billows rowled, 
The storm growled, and I 
yowled beside them 
The lightning flashed, the ingines smashed, 
And the captain swore that ill betide them. 
SPOKEN.—OW, murther ! murther ! but that was the day of sor-
row intirely. 
I 
thought it was all up with me. 
We were out 
for ten weeks and fourteen days; and we were tossed about un-
til the divil a 
bit I 
eat for seven years before, that didn't come 
gallopping up as if a 
whole brigade of blue horse cavalry was 
after it. 
It shook me as if there was a 
faction fight going on in-
side of me! 
CHORUS. 
I 
roared and bawled, and screamed and squalled, 
And wished the ship to go no further; 
I 
cursed the day I 
sailed away, 
And hollered, " Holy millia murther." 
Up went the ship.—" Oh dear," says I, 
And up whit my accounts that minute; 
Then down to L. or very nigh, 
I 
thought bedad I 
was half-way in it; 
The waves smashed down our mast of shmoke, 
It was no joke, at dead of night thin ; 
For sails and rigging danced a 
jig in 
The gale beneath the moon's dim light thin. 
SPOKEN.—Oh ! 
be the powers, it was the divil's own commo-
tion sure enough. One minute we were catching Mother Carey's 
chickens, among thunder and lightning, upstairs in the clouds ; 
the next minute we were dancing upon the back of a 
whale a 
tailor's hornpipe, or one of them knotty call dances—whales as 
big as the plains of Connamara or the Wicklow mountains, every 
one of them ! Begorra, ould Jonah would have had a 
mighty 
fine time swallowing one of them fellows. 
There's no use in 
talking—the waves bate the Bannabar and Bannahar bates the 
divil, but our unfortunate butter tub bate the pair of them. 
I 
began to keep on singing out— 
I 
roared and bawled, etc. 
The captain cried, " Mate," I 
shouted " drink," 
The ship has struck—she'll go asunder ! 
We reeled upon the grave's thin brink, 
That minute our cargo was bolts of thunder, 
The ingines melted— the hailstones pelted— 
And faith I 
felt it mighty quarely ; 
The vessel parted and so I 
started 
For shore on a 
stick, that morning airly. 
SPOKEN.—OW 
WOW! but it was terrible to hear the thunder 
and the lightning pelting away at each other as if they had both 
gone crazy ; then they would fire away at us as if there wasn't 
a 
target in the whole world for them to shoot at but our poor 
ship. 
There was I 
tossing about on the wather, like a 
pickled 
herring-, 
and the big fishes making every grab to get a 
hoult of 
me. But I 
got safe ashore at last as dead as a 
lobster, my mouth 
as full of mud and sand as ever it was full of praties and butter-
milk. 
Be me sowl, 
I 
roared and bawled, ete.

How dearly I

But oh, she would not listen, 
Tho' I

Oh, love, oh, love, why don't you heed me? 
How cart you treat tne so ? 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not my pain ; 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said—

Oh, ain't you awful; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Yes, you are awful ; 
Your like I 
ne'er did see;

It's wrong you know to love me 80, 
Dear me, you're horrid ; 
Why don't you let me be? 
To make my feelings clearer, 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said I'd like to hear her 
Say yes, ad ease my mind ; 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention ; 
She said mamma would scold her, 
If such things she dared to mention; 
" 
Come, love," I 
cried, " we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind." 
" 
Oh, no, oh, no," she said.

If we should run away 1"
