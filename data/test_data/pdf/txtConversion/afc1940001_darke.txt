The Dark Eyed SailorIt was of a comely young lady fair,As she walked out to take the airShe met
a sailor along the way,And I paid attention, and I paid attentionTo hear what they might say."Oh
lovely maiden, why roam alone?The night is coming and the day's far gone."She answered him,
while the tears did flow,"'Tis my dark eyed sailor, 'tis my dark eyed sailorHas caused this over flow."It
was seven long years since he left this land;He took a gold ring from off my hand,He broke the
token, here's one half with me,And the other's rolling, and the other's rollingIn the bottom of the
sea.""Oh maiden, drive him from off your mind,As good a sailor as him you'll find.Love turns aside
and cold doth grow,Like a winter's morning, like a winter's morningWhen fields are wrapped in
snow.""His coal black eyes and his curling hair,His flattering tongue did my heart ensnare,Genteel
he was and no rake like youWho'd advise a maiden, who'd advise a maidenTo slight that jacket
blue."As Willie did the ring unfold,She seemed distracted 'twixt joy and woe,She drew a dagger
and then did sigh,"For my dark eyed sailor, for my dark eyed sailorA maid I'll live and die."In a
cottage down by the river side,In unity they now reside,Oh girls, be true, while your lover's away,For
a cloudy morning, for a cloudy morningOft brings a pleasant day. TextRobertson; Sidney [md]
