S2: Well back in the late '30's a <gap> from Kingston came over here, and he got me and
<unintelligible text> to help him buy cattle. And we bought up about 214 head. We was
about 2 weeks a-getting everything lined up and we started to Alpena with them, and we
got on the way and sold his one of his brothers, boy, 14 head and that left us 200 head.
And we lost 8 head on the drives down in the canyon and he come back later and got
those and we got way back about 40 miles this side of Alpena - yeah we was a-horseback,
and it was 80 miles to Alpena from where we left our place here, on the Riley's creek. And
we drove them cattle to his place and stopped and stayed two days and let them rest and
he butchered one, and then we took them on, and we was oh we was about 30 days a-
rounding them up and getting them over there and getting back home and I got $2 a day
for me and my horse. And we was out oh about 40 miles this side of Alpena and he rode
up to a house and he said lady, I need something to eat for seven men and he said we
need to be a-moving on pretty quick. He said eggs and bacon and cornbread 'ud be good.

had to count every once in a while, on the road and herd then cattle and there weren't
very good fences then, and part of the bunch'ud set up good in there and the rest'd go
to bed and then at midnight the others 'ud take them over til daylight and then we'd head
out in that daylight with them. We got to Alpena and the right up north of Alpena we drove
them up a hill on top of a hill and put them in a big pasture. A feller name of Jim <Wardon?
> bought them all. <gap>. And then we started back home as quick as he got them all
lined up got his check, before we started home. And that was the end of the story. Well
I'm going to try to tell this part of the story. Missed a little of it. We was on the other side
of Red Star, and I took off down that hollow, about two miles on the other side of Red
Star and so one of them's <gap> the boss he was 81 years old the old man was and he
couldn't hear good and he couldn't, he'd have to set in the saddle and he couldn't turn his
head, and the old cow had a bell on him and and he was just going on the road hollering
Soo-ooo-oo. Sam said you go on <unintelligible text>, don't never stop for that old cow and
I said well I'll go on then, and I took after him on the little horse and about 2 miles around
the road why I caught him. I rode up beside of him, and I said <unintelligible text>, w've
lost them cattle and we got to get down there and try to get them out. And <unintelligible
text> said for you to go out there and

there with her and we'll get them out. <unintelligible text> said no, I know more about a
