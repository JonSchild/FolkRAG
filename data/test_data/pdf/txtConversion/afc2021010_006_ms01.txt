Interview with Roger Dale Taulbee – 1/29/22

I was referred to Roger Taulbee by Zack Mullins, the clerk at the Lost Creek, Kentucky Post Office, and 
his colleagues at the Jackson, Kentucky Post Office.  
 
Roger Taulbee (b. 1948, Campton, Kentucky) was a rural mail carrier in the Vancleve, Kentucky area for 
56-58 years. He inherited the route from his father, who carried the mail for 50 years, initially on 
horseback. In this interview, Taulbee speaks of the changes in the Postal Service over time, the vehicles 
he used to deliver the mail, and what he knows of his father’s time delivering the mail on horseback.  
 
Taulbee was somewhat reticent during the interview, and told me afterwards that he “gets nervous 
sometimes.” He wore his United States Postal Service belt buckle to the interview.

00:00 
EH: Alright, I'm here with Roger Dale Taulbee in Jackson, Kentucky, and it's January 29, 2022. Why 
don't you introduce yourself and tell me your name, where you're from and the year you were born? 
 
RT: My name is Roger Taulbee. I was born in Campton, Kentucky and my address right now is 
[redacted]  Campton, Kentucky. 
 
EH: Why don't you tell me when you started carrying the mail and how you got into it? 
 
RT: Well I got into it from my dad and I got started in 1964.  
 
EH: Yeah, tell me about your dad. What do you remember about him and if you don't mind sharing some 
of the stories he had about carrying the mail? 
 
RT: Well, as far as I know he used to carry it on a horseback and he carried it about 50 years. And he told 
me that his feet would freeze to the stirrup of the horse in the wintertime now. So, that's all I can tell you 
about him. And he's the one that got me started on this.  
 
EH: Did he own his own horse or was it a post office horse? 
 
RT: It was his own horses. He had a whole bunch of horses at the time. That was before my time you 
know. Then after his time, he had cars. He carried the mail from Jackson to West Liberty, 1953 I believe 
it was. And I was born in '48 so I was just a young lad whenever get got his cars and started driving the 
mail. 
 
EH: Do you remember those horses at all? 
 
RT: No, no, I wasn't...I don't know nothing about that now. 
 
EH: Yeah (laughs). Do you know what he would wear? Was there anything we could do to keep his foot 
from freezing to the stirrup? 
 
02:11  
 
RT: No, I don't. I don't know what he wore, I don't know a thing about that, you know. He just, he had to 
go up creeks and he didn't have no roads to travel like he does now. You know, used to people had to 
travel the roads, you know!  
 
EH: Wow. So tell me what it was like when you first started carrying the mail. How did you learn how to 
do it? 
 
RT: Well my dad, I learned from my dad. Dad was the one that had the mail route at the time. And about 
20 years ago he gave it up. 
 
EH: I'm sorry to hear that.

RT: So that was, he gave it to one route to me, one route to Gary, my baby brother, and my baby brother 
died of cancer. So now my nephew has got Gary's route. I had mine and I gave it up about 2 years ago. So 
I carried it anywhere from 56 to 58 years. I don't know exactly how long.  
 
EH: And so you had a different route over those years? 
 
RT: Yes, I carried it through War Creek. Daddy had a mail route all in one thing at that time. When I got 
sworn in to be a mail carrier, I went down to Campton, I was sworn in by Roy Tashell (sp?) at the 
Campton Post Office.  
 
EH: Why did you want to carry the mail? What was appealing to you about it? 
 
03:40  
 
RT: Well, I took over my dad's route and I just you know, I just enjoyed going, delivering the mail! I 
enjoyed it real good! 
 
EH: Why did you enjoy it? What did you like about it? 
 
RT: Well, I don't know I just, my dad had it and I just wanted to take over his procedures. 
 
EH: So tell me about some of the customers you would deliver to--who they were and how you got to 
know them.  
 
RT: Well now I don't know nothing about the customers. I couldn't tell you. I just put the mail in the box 
and back then we didn't have to have an ID card. We had to have, now we have to have an ID, when I 
quit, we had to have an ID card. We didn't have to have computers when we started. Now I have to, now 
you have to have them computers to scan packages, scan letters, and different things, you know.  
 
EH: Did it get harder when those technologies came in, or did that make things easier? 
 
RT: It just made it harder for me! Them computers. Used to I could get people, whoever I wanted to to 
ride the mail route with me, help me with the mail and later it got to where you had to have them ID cards 
and you couldn't do it. 
 
EH: So who rode with you sometimes to help you? 
 
RT: Do what now? 
 
EH: Who rode with you to help you? 
 
RT: Just different people, you know I could get different people back then. But now you can't get 'em! I 
had to do it by myself! 
 
EH: (laughs)  
 
RT: So that made it harder, you know. 
 
EH: Right. You didn't get to know any of your customers at all?

RT: Yes, yes! I know plenty of 'em. They was good to me, they was friendly to me, everyone I had was 
friendly! They know me! I was on, I lived almost on the route all my life.  
 
EH: Oh wow. 
 
RT: I delivered my own mail! 
 
EH: (laughs) I'm finding that a lot of people deliver their own mail.  
 
RT: Well, that's the way I done it, I just delivered my own mail you know. And I done it since '64 on up 
to I quit! 
 
05:58  
 
EH: Did they ever leave any gifts for you in the mailbox? 
 
RT: Yes. Christmas time.  
 
EH: What kind of things did they leave? 
 
RT: They'd leave me money, knives... 
 
EH: Knives! 
 
RT: Candy, just different things! 
 
EH: What kind of knives? Were they knives that they made? 
 
RT: Yeah, that was, like a case knife, you know, double-edged case knives and just different things, you 
know. Just different kind of knives. 
 
06:27  
 
EH: And candies--were they homemade candies? 
 
RT: Yes, yes. Peanut butter fudge, chocolate, that [audio cuts, but he talks about a peanut butter swirl 
candy here] confectionary sugar. 
 
EH: Uh-huh, uh-huh. That sounds good! Tell me about what kind of vehicle you used over time and how 
that changed? 
 
RT: Well I just used just a single two-wheel drive pick-up truck 'cause they didn't have no 4-wheel drives 
when I first started! And then later they went to, and it was standard shift. I had to drive standard shift up 
for a few years. Then I started out with automatic. I started out with cars. They didn't have very many 
trucks back then. Then finally they went to 4-wheel drives and I started driving them 4-wheel drives now. 
That's better! 
 
EH: Did you ever have a right-side drive car or did you reach over?

RT: I reached over ever since I was driving? 
 
EH: Even though you had the standard shift though--that seems hard to reach all the way over with the 
stick shift in the middle. 
 
RT: Well I'd have a straight seat and that was a help to me. Back then, they didn't used to have them 
bucket seats. 
 
EH: Right, right. 
 
RT: So I just had to use them straight seats and hold my foot on the brake and reach way over! 
 
EH: (laughs) Let's see. What was I gonna ask you about? Something about your car. Oh! Did the mail fit 
in your pickup truck? All of the mail? 
 
RT: Yes. I delivered out of a pick-up truck! See, most time I was delivering out of a pick-up truck as long 
as I get people to help me and a lot of the times I'd have a right hand seat and I'd pick the mail up and give 
it to 'em and they'd put it in the box. 
 
EH: Mmhm. Mmhm. Why don't you tell me what your day was like on a typical day on your route from 
when you, if you picked up the mail at the post office, to when you got home at night. 
 
RT: Well, I don't know nothing about that question now.  
 
EH: Okay. 
 
RT: I can't answer that 'cause I don't know much about it! 
 
EH: Okay. So, would you start your day going to the post office and sorting mail? 
 
RT: Yes, I'd go into the post office and sort mail. That's where I'd sort my mail at is over here at the 
Jackson Post Office to go through War Creek and I'd have mmmm...I've had about 20 postmasters I guess 
since I started. Everyone of them just about dead now!  
 
EH: Wow. And then so you'd sort the mail and then you'd put it in your car in order? 
 
RT: Yes, I'd put it in the car in order, carry it and then whenever I get to the box, I'd just have it on top. I'd 
go in, I started out here at the, this here government building down here on Jefferson, no not Jefferson but 
I can't think of the name of the street now. Come down Main Street there and there's a building down 
there that goes down towards the riverbanks. 
 
EH: Oh okay. 
 
RT: That was called a government building.  
 
EH: I see.

RT: And they used to have well, the post office used to be there. Court system used to be there. It used to 
be just a government building. And I started down there. Later on in the years they built a new post office 
over here right on the main highway in Jackson. 
 
EH: I see. Yeah, I think I've driven by that. 
 
10:29  
 
RT: Over there by the Dollar General store. 
 
EH: Oh yeah, I've been there [to the post office]. What is the most unusual thing you've ever delivered in 
the mail? 
 
RT: Well, there was a lot of packages that was unusual, big, heavy, and they'd be I'd get it delivered, some 
of 'em I'd take to the house, some of 'em I'd put down at the mailbox, that was before we started getting 
them scanners, you know. After we got the scanners, we had to take every one of 'em, that wouldn't fit in 
the mailbox, every one of 'em to the house, put them on the porch. 
 
EH: That's a lot of work. 
 
RT: Well, that was the name of the game! 
 
EH: Did you ever deliver any animals like chickens or bees? 
 
RT: Yes, I've delivered a lot of chickens. A lot of chickens. 
 
EH: Would they make a lot of noise in your truck? 
 
RT: Yes, they would! They'd aggravate you to death all day long! Some of 'em had to stay in there all 
day. 
 
EH: Did any ever get out? 
 
RT: No.  
 
EH: That's good. 
 
RT: No.  
 
EH: Have you ever had any animal encounters when delivering the mail? 
 
11:45  
 
RT: What? 
 
EH: Animal encounters or sightings? 
 
RT: No. 
 
EH: Never saw a bear or anything like that?

RT: No. 
 
EH: Well that's lucky.  
 
RT: I never seen a bear. I've seen squirrels! Rabbits! And snakes! 
 
EH: Snakes? That's not so lucky. 
 
RT: I've never seen a bear, lion, or bobcat or nothing like that you know. 'Cause they travel mostly 
overnight! 
 
EH: Right, right. 
 
RT: I've seen deers! There are deers around here but I don't think there's any bears. There's some elks 
around here but I never seen one of them.  
 
12:31  
 
EH: Did you ever find anything unusual in the mailbox like any birds making nests or anything like that? 
 
RT: No. I never found a thing in the mailbox unusual. 
 
EH: Well that's lucky! 
 
RT: Yeah. 
 
EH: How did your route change over time? Did you have more boxes added over time? 
 
RT: Well, when they got, if a post office went out, I got more boxes added. That's, as the post office went 
out. 
 
EH: When it closed you mean? 
 
RT: Yeah. 
 
EH: And which post office closed? 
 
RT: Well, it was, I had Elkatawa closed, Wolverine closed, Frozen Creek closed. Uh, War Creek closed 
and the Lawson Post Office closed. 
 
EH: Wow, that's a lot.  
 
RT: That was on the War Creek side now. And on my, when I started over on the Frozen Creek side, I 
was--Sewell Post Office and Mountain Valley Post Office and Taulbee Post Office. 
 
EH: And is that named after your relatives? 
 
RT: I don't know whether it is or not. It was there before my time.

EH: I see. 
 
RT: So. 
 
EH: So that's about 10 post offices you've seen close... 
 
RT: In my career, time.  
 
EH: Wow. How do you think that impacted the communities they were in? 
 
RT: Well see, they put the mail route on that, up them little old hollers and stuff like that. Add them on to 
me!  
 
EH: So was it--people who were used to coming to the post office, you then started delivering their mail, 
is that right? 
 
RT: Well, they seemed to like it better than going to the post office! Cause I'd be there. I'd have to, if they 
wanted money orders, I'd have to take it to the post office, get a money order. If they wanted special 
delivery on something, I'd have to give a special delivery on something. You know? Just whatever they 
needed! So I tried to serve the people as best I could.  
 
EH: I bet they really appreciated you. 
 
RT: They did. They did. They really loved me, every one of 'em did. Right now they, every one of 'em 
still yet. 
 
EH: They miss you I bet! 
 
RT: They do. 
 
EH: How did the area on your route, did it change from when you first started? 
 
RT: Yes it did. Seemed like they keep different things on to you, they keep taking things off of you. And 
everything just changed. Just kept changing. Just different things! 
 
EH: Like what kind of things? 
 
RT: Just different things! I couldn't tell you what all the things, but now, it changed, you know, taking 
them post offices out. That changed a whole lot. See that took up a whole lot of my time right there when 
they took out them post offices 'cause I had to deliver more mail. 
 
EH: Yeah, I bet. So did you have a longer day then? 
 
RT: Did I what? 
 
EH: You had a longer day? 
 
RT: Yeah, every time they'd add a box to me, it'd be about 15 minutes!

EH: Wow.  
 
RT: So. 
 
EH: Yeah, and do you know how many miles your route was? 
 
RT: It was about 300 mile I'd say. 
 
EH: Every day! 
 
RT: Yeah, every day. 
 
EH: That is a really long route. And how long would that take you? 
 
RT: Well, I'd start sometimes by 7 o'clock in the morning. It would take me to about 3 o'clock in the 
afternoon. 
 
EH: And would it be a loop or would you have to backtrack to your house? 
 
RT: I'd have to, I'd go up like Frozen, up there towards where I live, turn around that way. I would have to 
go up that way, back track myself back out--that takes a lot of time to backtrack about 20 miles out of 
there!  
 
EH: Mmhm. Mmhm. That's a long route. What about the land and the you know, the landscape on your 
route? Could you describe it to someone who has never been to this area? 
 
RT: No I can't, I can't describe. I ain't much on describing things now! 
 
EH: (laughs) Okay. Let's see, what else. When you were delivering, did you bring snacks along with you 
or any other supplies? 
 
RT: Sometimes I would. See, when I first started they had post offices, a little store here, a store there, 
and here, there. And I'd stop maybe every once in a while and get me a snack, and maybe a pop or 
something and head on out. 
 
EH: What was your preferred snack? 
 
RT: Them little cheese crackers or something like, and a pop. Sometimes I'd get me a bag of tater chips. 
When I'd get me a long [unintelligible] I'd get me a bag of tater chips! 
 
EH: (laughs) Nice. And what about clothing. Did you have to dress warmly in the wintertime? What did 
you usually... 
 
RT: In my car, I kept a good heater in it! 
 
EH: Oh, okay. 
 
RT: I just kept a good heater. Everything seemed to be warm in there.

EH: That's good. 
 
RT: I could lay my window down and stay warm. 
 
EH: Oh that's great! 
 
RT: That way I wouldn't have to, when I was by myself, I wouldn't have to roll my window up and down 
and then there they come along with them automatic windows, push button windows and I could roll it up 
and down and keep warm! 
 
EH: Yeah, before when you had the crank windows, I bet that was a lot of cranking up and down to 
deliver each box.  
 
RT: Yes it was, it was a lot of cranks. 
 
18:32  
 
EH: Did your arm get strong? 
 
RT: Yes, it got strong, now it's weak now! 
 
EH: (laughs) What else, let's see here, did you ever encounter any bad weather that was a challenge for 
delivering anything? 
 
RT: Yes, I had a lot of snow in the wintertime. It was real bad. Like right now, we've been having a lot of 
bad weather this winter. 
 
EH: Yeah, we have. 
 
RT: Back in uh, '40, the '50s we'd have snow about every day in the wintertime. And it, I've had to push 
snow with the front bumper of the truck. 
 
EH: Did you ever spin off the road or anything? 
 
RT: Yes, I've been off roads plenty of times.  
 
EH: But you still were able to deliver all the mail that day? How did you get back on the road? 
 
RT: Well, sometimes I'd have to get a wrecker to come pull me out.  
 
EH: That's no fun. 
 
RT: No, that's not no fun. Not with a wrecker had to come pull you out and cost you about 20 and 30 
dollars a trip.  
 
EH: Right. But the snow, it doesn't seem like there's as much as there was in the 50s? 
 
RT: No. No.

EH: Well let's see what else. Did you see the type of mail that you delivered change over time? 
 
RT: Yes. It got heavier! 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
RT: A lot heavier. They argued that it wouldn't get heavy, but it did. 
 
EH: And why is that. Why did it get heavier? 
 
RT: Well, there'd be more letters come in, there'd be more letters go out and around Christmas time, I'd 
pick up a lot of Christmas cards out of mailboxes and mail 'em out!  
 
EH: Did you get letters to Santa? 
 
RT: No. No. 
 
EH: No kids writing letters to Santa? 
 
RT: Did you ever write letters to Santa when you was... 
 
EH: Yeah! Definitely! You have to tell him what you want! 
 
RT: Yeah? Yeah. Most of 'em didn't believe in Santa on my route. 
 
EH: Oh yeah. 
 
RT: Around in them big cities they believe in Santa Claus. 
 
EH: You don't think they do out in the country? 
 
RT: They don't out in the country much. 
 
EH: Interesting. I wonder why. 
 
RT: Huh? 
 
EH: I wonder why.  
 
RT: I don't know!  
 
EH: Huh. What about were there any funny mailboxes that people had made? 
 
RT: No. 
 
EH: No. All standard mailboxes? 
 
RT: All standard mailboxes.

RT: Driving!  
 
EH: You liked to drive? 
 
RT: Yeah. 
 
EH: Would you listen to the radio or anything? 
 
RT: Yeah, sometimes I would. Not much though. I didn't have time!  
 
EH: Yeah, right.  
 
RT: And sometimes I'd forget what I was listening to on the radio, so I'd just turn it off! 
 
EH: Would you listen to music or talk radio or what? 
 
RT: I'd listen to the talk radio. I like to listen to news, find out what's going on in the country. And I like 
to go up there and get the paper every week right now to see what's going on in the county! 
 
EH: Yeah, right. 
 
RT: See if any of my mail patrons died over the years.  
 
EH: Yeah. Do you stay in touch with any of your patrons? 
 
RT: Yes I do! I go see them every now and then right now!

EH: Oh very nice. 
 
RT: They still appreciate me the same as they did! 
 
EH: And who are they? What kind of things do they do and... 
 
RT: Well some of 'em does a lot of gardening. They gave me corn, right now they still give me corn. 
They give me country eggs--I love my country eggs. 
 
EH: (laughs) They're the best. 
 
RT: Oh, give me country eggs, give me green beans, give me tomatoes mmm, mmm, mmm--I love them 
tomatoes! 
 
EH: (laughs)

EH: Was that fresh or did they ever give you canned goods? 
 
RT: Yes, they give me canned goods. I got a woman right now gives me canned tomatoes, gives me 
canned beans, canned cabbage, mmmm. 
 
EH: Nice. Like chow-chow? 
 
RT: Chow-chow. I get that a lot! 
 
EH: That sounds good. 
 
RT: Yep.  
 
EH: That's a good job perk. 
 
RT: Do you like it? 
 
EH: Oh yeah, I love it! Were there special kind of tomatoes, do you know? 
 
RT: No. Just different kinds of tomatoes! 
 
EH: Nice big... 
 
RT: I got some last year about that big [dinner plate size] out of the garden! One slice would make a big 
meal! Put it on a big baloney sandwich, mmm-mmm! 
 
EH: (laughs) Do you have your own garden? 
 
RT: No. No. 
 
EH: You just benefit from other people's garden. 
 
RT: Yep. 
 
EH: I see. What was the hardest part of the job for you? 
 
RT: Well I don't know about that now it's just, 'cause you know I had to deliver to everybody so there 
wasn't no hard jobs about it. No harder job nowhere else, not one place! 
 
EH: And did you feel good about your pay? 
 
RT: Yes, I felt good 'cause it kept me going! 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
RT: That's what kept me going is my pay.

RT: So I just had the mail route in my name about 10 years. Because my dad, in about his 70s, when he 
was about 70, he give it all up.  
 
EH: I see. 
 
RT: And that's what, when they put it in our names is whenever he got disabled to do it. See he had a 
wreck down there at Vancleve when he was carrying the mail. He started to pull out there and the state 
man come along, backed in, turned him over. He went back down there to get his car--he left his car down 
there--and him and my wife went and delivered some mail. And they, the state man turned him over and 
he was throwed out of the truck and got his ribs broke, neck broke. 
 
EH: Oh no! 
 
RT: And he had to go to Lexington and spend 30 days and nights in the Lexington hospital. 
 
EH: Oh that's awful. I'm sorry to hear that. Let's see. What do you think the importance is of rural mail 
carriers, people who deliver--highway contractors too--who deliver to rural communities? 
 
RT: Well, I think it's a great job, but they just don't get as much pay as rural carriers and I think that they 
should have a little more pay. 
 
EH: Mmhm, mmhm. 
 
RT: That's what I think about it.  
 
EH: Yeah, why are some carriers contractors and others are salaried? 
 
RT: I don't know about that now, I can't answer that question 'cause I don't know.

EH: So is there still a post office at Vancleve? 
 
RT: Yes! There's still a post office at Vancleve. It's open on the weekends 8 'til 12 I believe it is, and from 
12 'til 4 through the week. So. 
 
EH: Yeah. And so it's open about 4 hours a day now. And is that different from what it used to be? 
 
RT: Yeah. It used to be open 8 hours a day. 
 
EH: Oh yeah. 
 
RT: And they used to be just different postmasters come in, back then, like they do now.  
 
EH: Did you know when that changed? 
 
RT: I tell you around '70 when that come in. 
 
EH: I see. Were you part of a union?

RT: No. I wasn't no part of no union. 
 
EH: Did you feel like were you in touch with other mail carriers? Did you have kind of a community of 
people who had similar jobs? 
 
RT: I don't know about that one now. I can't answer that because I don't know.  
 
EH: Okay (laughs) Are there certain jokes or language of people who carry the mail, that you tell to each 
other when you get together? Because you said some other people in your family had carried the mail. 
What are the stories you tell to each other about your job? 
 
RT: Well I could tell them if it's a good job, I just love my job and when I quit I'd have been still carrying 
if I hadn't had a heart attack. 
 
EH: Oh wow. 
 
RT: I had to quit 'cause whenever I went to Hazard to have that stent put in, I had to, I just had to go and 
have a stent put in and while I was in there, I just decided I just was gonna give it up. I'd have probably 
still been carrying if it wasn't for that. 
 
EH: And that was in 2020? 
 
RT: That was about 2 years ago. 
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
RT: 2019 I believe it was.  
 
EH: Okay. Seems like you're doing pretty well right now! 
 
RT: Yeah, they done an operation on me 3 times in the same stent. They put a stent in and it collapsed, 
they put a balloon in and it collapsed. They turned around and put another new stent in and a different 
one, a different type or something, I don't know, said it was a different type so... 
 
EH: Wow. Well I'm glad to see you doing a lot better.  
 
RT: Well, I'm glad I'm doing better too! 
 
EH: So how many people in your family have carried the mail? 
 
RT: Well there's me, and daddy--Eugene Taulbee was his name. And Harold, my oldest brother. Gary 
was my baby brother. And right now Joel Borsher's (sp?) got it--that's my nephew. Paul, my middle-aged 
brother got it, had it. That's all the brothers I had! 
 
EH: Wow, so everyone!  
 
RT: Well they helped daddy before I got it. They helped on his route. 
 
EH: One thing I'm finding is that there's a lot of musicians who carry the mail. Were anyone in your 
family musicians.

RT: No. I've never heard of none of 'em playing music of no kind. 
 
EH: (laughs) Not even singing? 
 
RT: Well, when they go to church they'd sing, that's about the only time! 
 
EH: Yeah (laughs). Let's see, did you ever have to help any of your customers if they had something 
happen when you came upon them on your route?  
 
RT: No, no I didn't. I didn't have to help none of 'em! 'Cause it seemed like everybody kept a vehicle 
going. Kept a vehicle going good!  
 
EH: Nice. 
 
RT: They'd help me sometimes! 
 
EH: They'd pull you out of a ditch? 
 
RT: Yeah (laughs). 
 
EH: Well, let's see. Are there any other stories? Are there any stories you like to tell about your job to 
other people?  
 
RT: No, not that I know of you know! I just now told all my stories that I know of! 
 
EH: (laughs) Well, thanks so much for your time. Is there anything else you'd like to share about your 
work? 
 
RT: No, not that I know of. 
 
EH: Alright, well thanks so much Roger.
