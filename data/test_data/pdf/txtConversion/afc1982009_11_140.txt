Dear Mr. Kuykendall: 
I am enclosing a copy of the American Folklife Center’s final 
report for the Blue Ridge Parkway Folklife Project. You will recall that 
the fieldwork phase of this project was undertaken in the summer of 1978. 
At that time you had telephone conversations with me and Charles Wolfe 
regarding the project. 
Please let me know if any additional materials would be of 
interest to you, or if you would like copies of any of the publications 
mentioned in our report. Ormond Loomis, the consultant assisting in the 
preparation of our "cultural conservation" report for the Department of 
the Interior, said he enjoyed talking to you a few weeks ago and sends his 
regards. Best wishes and good luck in your work. 
Yours truly

Dear D.K. 
I thought you might be interested to see a copy of this final 
report from our Blue Ridge project. I hope you are doing fine, and that 
your video equipment is thriving and getting lots of use. All of us at

Best wishes.

Dear Andy, 
Here is an advance (typos and all) 
copy of the Blue Ridge final report. 
We'll move on the final, final copy 
very soon, so be sure to let me know 
at once if you wish to suggest changes. 
Meanwhile, how many copies of Blue

purposes? 
Best wishes.

Dear Roy, 
Here's the final draft of our final report 
from the Blue Ridge Project. We are circulating 
advance copies to a few folks—including you 
and Andy Kardos--and plan to adjust and 
rework a few things during the next week or 
so. Please let me know if you have any 
suggestions. 
We expect the phonograph record in November 
and plan to submit our whole "package,"
