H:  Yeah, I born in Saigon.
B:  In what year?
H:  Now I live with, with my, my cousin when I was about five year old until I escape my 
country.  My, my parents and the whole families live in Bien Hoa.  Bien Hoa is about twenty 
miles, uh, twenty miles from Saigon.  But I, I didn't live with my parents.
B:  You didn't.  You were born in 1962?
H:  Yes, 1962.
B:  What month, what month?
H:  Uh, November.  November, 1962.
B:  So you don't remember too much about the Vietnamese War?
H:  Mm, no, not really.
B:  Yeah.  And you came (--)
B:  Because, you know, I live in Saigon.  And that's jungle, you know.  It happened in the other 
city around Saigon.  Maybe is in the middle of my country, you know, because my country 
divided into three part.  Three parts on, North Vietnam, or in the middle, Vietnam, and the other 
one is in South Vietnam.  But it originally happened in the middle.  (B:  And then you lived?)  
Because of the boundary in the middle, you know?
B:  Umhm, right.  So you didn't, you weren't involved in the war directly?
H:  No.
B:  And then when the Communists came you left in 19, you said 1975?
H:  Excuse me?
B:  When, when did you leave Vietnam and go to Indonesia?
H:  Oh 19, um, 1981.
B:  Oh, '81?
H:  Yes.  And I live in Indonesia for, for three year.
B:  Three years?
H:  Yes, yes.
B:  At that camp?
H:  Yes, I come there just about three years, but I try to learn English in Indonesia.  I mean in the 
[unclear] camp.
B:  Right.
H:  And I come to the USA, I know how to speak English, how to understand the people talk, 
something.  Is not too much, you know, just, just understand and talking.  The regular things.  I 
have uh, three months in ah, the college for English, I mean I study English, in New Orleans.
B:  What?  English as a second language?
H:  Yes.
B:  E.S.L.?
H:  Yes, E.S.L.
B:  Were you working in Vietnam?
H:  No.
B:  You were too young?
H:  Yeah, I, I was too young.  I went to high school in my country, high school.  (B:  Umhm)  
After uh, you know I graduate high school, and then after that I just try to escape my country.  So
I got no job.  I mean, I spend the whole time to looking for, look for the way to escape my 
country.  But you know, that time my parents arrange for me to escape, you know.
B:  They arranged for you?
H:  Yes.  They, uh (--)
B:  Are they, are they still there?
H:  Yeah, they were still there.
B:  Are they?  Can they come here?
H:  No, no, I don't think so.  Because my parents are too old.  So uh, they taught if they come 
here [unclear] is difficult, you know, difficult for the old people, especially about English, you 
know, second language.  (B:  Right)  And how can they talk?  And how can they understand the 
people?  And the other things I thought is there's quite difference in cultural, you know, different 
cultural.
B:  What are, what are some of the biggest differences?
H:  Because uh, when uh, the old people live in my country, they are very friendship with the 
other people.  I mean, is in our neighborhood.  They, they just want to uh, go to uh, their friend, 
they just go to their friend and visit there.  They don't need to make appointment.  They don't 
need to call, and you know, just come there to visit there.  And I know Communism in my 
country, very hard to live.  But the old people, they still feel more comfortable, you know, (B:  
Right) because uh, they are old, [few words unclear].  They don't care.  And, you know, isn't it, is
young people who scared, because they uh, the Communism force them to uh, join in the army, 
something.  They have to fight with the other country.  And they have no freedom.  And do, 
whatever they do, they have to look around.  And scared something, you know.
B:  So it's the young people who want to leave more than the old people?
H:  Yeah.  Some uh, some old people come here and they are boring, and the trouble of their 
language, the culture.  And then they try to uh, go back to country.  [Chuckles]
B:  Did you go to ah, a temple or a church?
H:  Uh, I'm going to a church every Saturday.
B:  Oh!  Which one?
H:  Oh, St. Patrick.
B:  Oh, okay.  So are you a Catholic?
H:  Yes, I'm Catholic.
B:  Are a lot of Vietnamese in Lowell Catholic, or some Buddhist?
H:  Not not really.  Just about seventy, or one hundred people.  That's all.  Not too much.  Not too
many.
B:  Are, are some Buddhist?  Other religions?
H:  Yeah, some Buddhist.
B:  Do they go to a temple?
H:  I don't know, because uh, there's no temple in here, just Cambodian temple.
B:  Yeah, and Laos.
H:  So maybe it's a difference from Vietnamese Temple, so they don't want you come, you know?
B:  How about, uh, customs like, uh, food?
H:  Oh, food?
B:  [Chuckles]
H:  Yeah.  You know, the most I say people doesn't get along with American food, you know?
B:  They don't?
H:  No, they don't.  Except the young people, they come here.  Seeing they go as a boy who is 
young, then they grow up in uh,  America, America. And so they get along with American food.  
(B: Right)  But the old people come here, they, they couldn't, they can't eat American food.  
Sometimes just a little bit, you know.
B:  What, what kind of, what are the main kinds of food that they want to eat?
H:  Oh, just uh, just rice.
B:  Rice?
H:  Rice, yes.  They eat rice every day.  And just rice and some, uh, some special food in my 
country.  I mean, it's, uh, it's like noodle, something.  They call pho.  That, and they call in my 
country pho, (B:  Pho) yeah, p-h-o. 
B:  Is that, those are noodles?
H:  Yes.  Noodle.  They put, they put some uh, soup in there, some uh, beef, some uh, vegetable, 
something.
B:  Right.

B:  Do you, uh, do you prepare that yourself at home?
H:  Yeah (--)
B:  Do you cook?
H:  Yeah, it's not too hard to cook.  They, they cook by uh, beef bone, beef bone, they put in.  
They put in something else, and (--)
B:  What kind, what kind of vegetables?
H:  Oh, it's like bean uh, it's you know, soybean, something.
B:  Um hm.  Soybeans?
H:  Yeah, and uh, some, some kind of vegetable, I don't know how to call that.  (B:  Yeah)  But 
American doesn't eat that.
B:  No?
H:  No.
B:  Do you, where do you buy it?
H:  Sometimes American eat that because, they, they eat that all the time.  I mean, they, they can 
come to restaurant, and they order pho all the time.  So they know what's that.  (B:  Umhm)  
They can eat that.
B:  Where do you get your food then?
H:  No, in uh, in a Laotian store, in Cambodian store.  (B:  Oh, okay)  We don't have Vietnamese 
store in here.  We have some in Boston, but, it's, it's not quite difference, from uh, Laotian and 
Vietnamese you know, food.
B:  So Laotian food and Vietnamese food are similar?  [Other comment unclear-both speak at 
same time]
H:  It's not quite difference, but is it a little bit.
B:  You use the same vegetables?
H:  Yes, the same.  But some, some kind I never eat in uh, in uh Cambodian, or [unclear] food.
B:  You don't?
H:  No, I don't.
B:  Why?
H:  Because uh, it's like American and they, they doesn't eat Vietnamese food, you know.  
Sometimes they can't eat that.  It's like me, sometimes I can't eat that.  So, I can't.  
B:  What's, what's the main difference between Vietnamese food and say, Laotian, or Cambodian,
or Thai food?
H:  I don't know, because uh, each food have a smell different, (B:  different) a different smell 
(--)
B:  Yeah, different spices.

H:  It's uh, come from the owners.
B:  Oh Popeye's.  Okay.  Okay.

H:  Because the first time I just, I just come to uh USA
B:  Um hm.
H:  Somebody bought for me some, and when I live in [unclear] camp, I don't have enough food 
to eat.  
B:  Right?
H:  That's right.  [Chuckles]  You know I, when I see the, oh is, it's good when you know, when

B:  You eat hamburgers?
H:  Yeah, sometimes.
B:  Pizza?
H:  You know, I don't like it, but I still eat that, because it's uncomfortable for, um, when I go to 
school, I have just about an hour, half hour, to uh, to get out for lunch.
B:  Right.
H:  So it's easy just come there, to order one and just a few minutes to eat that, and then go back 
to school.
B:  But when you cook at home, you cook Vietnamese food?
H:  Yes.  I cook Vietnamese food.  Sometimes Chinese food.  It's not difference from Chinese 
and Vietnamese food.

B:  About twelve years old?
H:  Yes.
B:  She's going to school?
H:  Yes.  She went to uh, St. Patrick School.
B:  Oh.
H:  Private school.  It's very good, because uh, some sister in there, because uh, that's a private 
school and Catholic school.  (B:  Right. right)  And they try to take care of my sister, you know?  
You know, first, I mean uh, my sister come America, America for two years.  Two years later, I 
mean, two years later.
B:  Two years after you?
H:  No.  She come the same time.
B:  Oh.
H:  But she went to, I send him, I send her to uh, Chicago.
B:  Oh.
H:  My cousin live there.
B:  Oh, your (--)
H:  Then she went to a Chicago school.  And after that, two years later, I took her from Chicago 
to uh, to Lowell.  She uh, she doesn't know how to speak English.  She, she doesn't know how.  I 
mean it's very stupid, because she live in America for two years.  I don't know why.
B:  And she didn't learn English?
H:  Yeah, she did.  She went to school, but after I send her to St.  Patrick School, (B:  Right) and 
after one year she speak English very good.  It's like American voice, and you know, accents like 
American.
B:  Yeah.
H:  Maybe the sister take care too much in the school.
B:  She's younger, too.  It's easier when you're young, when you're younger.  (H:  yes, younger)  
She was what, nine years old when she came here?  [Few words unclear]
H:  Yes, nine year old.
B:  Do you think she's becoming more Americanized?
H:  Yeah, she's, she love American food.  Do something like American culture, you know.

B:  What does he do?
H:  Uh, he's uh, do something about computer, something in Wang.
B:  Oh Wang?
H:  Yes.
B:  Electronics?
H:  Yeah, electronic.
B:  Did,, did, did you live in New Orleans with him?  New Orleans?
H:  Oh yes.  I live in New Orleans with him.  And I come here before he, he did.  I come here for 
a year later.
B:  Um hm.
H:  I, I call him and he came here.  He came here just about two years.  1986, sometime.
B:  Well, what are some of the other customs that you are changing from Vietnam, Vietnam to 
America?  Uh, let's see, language is one.
H:  Yeah.
B:  You learned English.
H:  Yeah, maybe the life of, uh, younger people change too much.
B:  Too much.
H:  Yes, too much.  Because, uh, in my country if the younger people is I mean, uh, under 
eighteen, (B:  Umhm) when they go somewhere they have to ask their parents.  They do, 
whatever they do, they have to ask parents and need uh, need ideas from parents.  When they 
come here, there's some people they uh, they don't care, the parents, you know.  Did you want to 
go, go somewhere, you know.
B:  Um hm.
H:  They don't care, they just, why don't you go!
B:  So, that (--)
H:  So it's, it's quite different.
B:  The discipline and the family.
H:  Yeah.
B:  Or parents' control.
H:  The parents can't control them.
B:  Not as much control.
H:  Yeah.
B:  That's more like an American family.
H:  Yeah, system. Yeah, I know.
B:  What about (--)
H:  Yeah.  Even uh, the older, older people, I mean, over in eighteen years, when they go 
somewhere, they have a date, or something, they still have to ask the parents.
B:  Oh.
H:  They, they, until they get married, they still belong to the parents.  I mean the parents still 
control them.  Sometimes they need to do something, ask parents.  That's in my country, you 
know.
B:  Yes.  Do parents pick who you will marry?
H:  Not really.  That's a very old custom.
[Both are speaking at same time.  Interviewer's comment unclear]
B:  Very old.
H:  But, it happens sometimes.  But it's not a lot of people do that now.
B:  But young people here are dating in American, like Americans.  That they want to go out with
someone, they just go.
H:  Yeah.
B:  Just for a date.
H:  Yes.
B:  Go to a dance.  Go to a party, or movie.
H:  Yeah.  But some uh, some people live, I mean uh, the most it happen with the male people, 
you know.
B:  Uh huh.  More, more of the boys than the girls.
H:  I mean more the girls than the boys, female.
B:  Oh.  They're changing more, the girls?
H:  Yeah, because uh, if they live here with their parents, they belong to parents, it's better.  But 
they come here by themselves, they just control themselves.  
B:  Um hm.
H:  So they, they just do whatever they want.  Some, some people, they just want to dance and go
to the party.  No school, you know.
B:  Oh.
H:  Because uh, they have no parents here.
B:  Because they have no parents.
H:  Yeah.
B:  Will that be a problem with your sister?  Or will she do what you, you and your brother say?
H:  No, because my sister, I take care of her like my parents, you know.
B:  Right.  And she respects you as (--)
H:  Yes.
B:  What you say?
H:  Yes.  Because uh, I really don't want my sister go out much, you know.  Because uh, 
sometimes they uh, they get along with American culture.  I can't control her, you know.  
Sometime they, they say why don't you go, they go.  She want to go, she doesn't want to ask me 
if uh, she go out too much.
B:  But she's only twelve.
H:  Yeah, only twelve.
B:  Twelve years old, so another couple of years, she may start dating.
H:  Yeah, I know.
B:  Things will change.
H:  But I just try to keep her in my control.  Control, yeah.  (B:  Right, under control)  But I, I 
just try to do it.  But, [chuckles] I'm not guaranteed to do it. 
B:  Um hm.  Well do you speak French?
H:  No.  My parents speak French.  The most, uh, older people in my country speak French.
B:  Speak French, yeah.
H:  You know, because French came to my country before.
B:  Right, right.  Before the Americans?
H:  Yeah, before Americans.  And then after American came to my country, the, the all of the 
people change to uh, change to uh study English.
B:  English.
H:  Yeah.  I study English in my uh, high school in Vietnam.
B:  Even after the Communists?
H:  Yeah.
B:  They teach English too?
H:  Yes.
B:  Hm.
H:  They teach English and, uh, uh, Chinese and, you know, Soviet.
B:  Russian?
H:  I don't know what, what it call that, Soviet?
B:  Soviet?
H:  Yes.
B:  That's Russian?  The language?
H:  Yes.
B:  That the Soviets speak?
H:  Yeah.
B:  It's Russian.
H:  Russian?
B:  Russian.
H:  They call that?
B:  Yeah.
H:  Oh.
B:  (Speaks few words in Russian)
H:  [Laughs]
B:  [Laughs]  I learned that in high school.
H:  Oh.
B:  I took Russian.
H:  [Laughs
B:  Do you still,uh, do you speak Vietnamese mostly with, with other Vietnamese in Lowell?
H:  Yes.  That's my trouble.  That's my trouble.  I mean it's good for me when I keep my 
language, my modern language.
B:  Right.
H:  But, it's, it's no good when I talk English.  I still have Vietnamese accent.  Sometimes the 
people does, doesn't understand (B:  Right) what I want to say, you know.  I live with American 
friend for a few months in [Bedford?], near my school.  That's how I speak English better.
B:  Oh, yeah.
H:  Then but I, I don't get along with the American, uh, culture.  So I left for him.
B:  Um hm.
H:  And moved out.
B:  You don't get along with American culture?
H:  No.
B:  What, what do you mean?
H:  No, I mean.  I don't know.  When I live with him, I see, uh, he went to work in the morning 
until uh, until uh, the night time.
B:  Right.
H:  Just like that.  Every day he go out and go back, and go out and go back.
B:  Um hm.
H:  Nothing happened in my life.  And I go to school and go back, and uh, study and then go to 
sleep, and go to school.
B:  Right.
H:  It's, it's like a cycle.
B:  Right.
H:  I can't, I can't cook at home because I live with him.  I scared.  I'm (--)  I don't know that, but 
I scared he, he doesn't want to smell some Vietnamese food, you know.
B:  Uh huh.
H:  But I just try to avoid that.
B:  Um.  Did he cook?
H:  No.  Sometime he went to restaurant.  Hamburger, whopper, something.
B:  Right.
H:  That's why I have to, went to, I had to go to American food too.  I mean hamburger, whopper 
every day.
B:  Right.
H:  It's boring.  So
B:  Yes.
H:  I can't eat that anymore.  [laughs]
B:  That's true.
H:  Yeah.
B:  So when you came back here, you're, you don't speak English as often?
H:  No.
B:  You don't speak.
H:  I say it in my school.
B:  Do you have many friends who speak Vietnamese here?
H:  Yes.
B:  When you speak English, you thinking Vietnamese, in Vietnamese?
H:  Nah, yeah I did, I did when, um, when a few, a few months I just come here, you know?  I

B:  Right.
H:  So far, sometime I just talk talk talk, because I talk often, you know.
B:  Um hm.
H:  So I, I don't have to, uh, transfer into my language.
B:  What are some of the other big differences in traditional Vietnamese ways, and in here in 
America.  Is this the same, health or medical?  Is that different?  
H:  Yeah it's different.  Though some uh, my um, my people when they get sick, they just stay

how to speak Cambodian, how to speak Laotian, and work with him and translate.  They have 
an, they, some, sometimes they just went to uh, the doctor.  They have, they don't have to make 
an appointment.  They just come and uh, take, you know, something.
B:  Um hm.
H:  So it's more comfortable for Laotian people, because Laotian people, they don't need to make
an appointment when they come to see, to get in.

H:  [Chuckles]  Um, the most Vietnamese in my country, they, they don't use check.  They use 
cash (B: Oh, no credit) all the time, yeah.  Because uh (--)
B:  No credit?

people who's rich, you know?
B:  Yeah.  
H:  They have much money.  They want to ah, make a business, or something.  They put money 
in there.  And the most people they keep money at home.

B:  So, fire?  
H:  Fire, yeah.

something.  But some, uh, some people they use money to buy gold.  Gold, and they put, they 
put at home.  Sometimes the fire, or something, they still keep that and take it out, you know.  
B:  When you left, when you left Vietnam was it hard to take anything with you?
H:  No.
B:  Could you take (--)
H:  Just a short and a tee-shirt, that's all.  
B:  That's all.
H:  Because my [unclear] I mean my boat about ah, four or five feet, four or five feet, feet wide.  
And is about twenty one maybe twenty five feet long.  There, there were fifty-two peoples on 
that, on that boat, yeah.  The level, the level of water is just like this.  Just about two inch, or 
sometimes one inch.
B:  Wow, if you were in a storm (--)
H:  Yeah, you know (--)
B:  You would be (--)
H:  Just about five persons fall and live.
B:  Fall in?
H:  I mean ah, five persons ah, alive.  
B:  Oh, five persons left?
H:  I mean it's about ninety, ninety-five persons die, you know?  So they have no hoping.  They 
escape, oh, they have no freedom.  They have nothing in my country.  So they try to escape.  The
most of the young, younger people escape from my country.  
B:  From the South anyway.
H:  Yes.  Some, some people in the North.  They still come to ah, South and then escape from 
South to the other country.

on my boat they just drive, they have no direction.  They just want to try, they just want to 
escape, you know.  
B:  Yeah.
H:  So maybe they, they half expect when they get out of my country, they meet some ship, big 
ship.  The ship will save them, you know.  So they just try.
B:  Your brother and sister went with you?  (H:  Yes)  The three of you?

H:  You mean, because American way different from Vietnamese way.  When I, when I draw, I 
mean when I draw in my country I use brush and something.  And, just like that.  But I come to 
here, they never, they never use brush with charcoal.
B:  No.
H:  No.  So, they just use the fingers and something like that.

B:  They're similar with all the different colors.
H:  Yeah.  If ah, if you paint a painting, I mean a technique like some artist [unclear], it means 
you have to ah, create, create a new way to do, you know.  Maybe it's better.

know how to paint.  
B:  Yeah.

you know.
B:  Because you couldn't get, you didn't know how to get the ones you wanted.
H:  Yeah, because I have no color theory.  
B:  Right.  So you have more control now.  
H:  Yeah, more control now.  But, you know, you have, I mean if you want to be a famous painter
you know, you have to create your own, your own way, you know.  Never copy from some artist.
They're looking, they'll copy from artist.  They'll do it for, it's not a practice, you know?  Then 
later on you can try, you try to create, create a new way.

H:  Yes.  Most, most parents in here, they try to keep their children to be Vietnamese, and talk, 
speak Vietnamese at home, and learn how to write, you know.
B:  And to read.
H:  But ah, it's like my sister when she come here.  She know how to write, how to write in 
Vietnamese language, you know, something.  And then a few, a few months, a few first months 
she just came here, she write a letter to ah, to my parents sometime.  And then later on she forgot,
she forgot.  So I ask her, "you write a letter to ah, to parents?"  She write a letter, but sometime 
she put English word in there.  Sometime she write Vietnamese word, and English, and 
Vietnamese, English.  [Chuckles]  So even when I read that I don't understand what it, what it 
say.  So, I mean my parents never understand when they see it drawn like that.  
B:  They won't read English.  They don't [unclear].
H:  No, no.  That's why I had the trouble.  And maybe a few years later she write all English, no 
Vietnamese.  [Laughs] 
B:  Do you have books at home?  
H:  Yeah.
B:  In Vietnamese?  
H:  Yeah.  So I, I stay with um, give her idea to read the book, you know.  I advise her to, to read 
the Vietnamese book, and to write Vietnamese.
B:  It takes practice.  
H:  Yeah.
B:  Or you forget.  
H:  Yeah.  I just try to keep my sister to be a Vietnamese, and I mean, know how to write, (B:  
Umhm) how to read.  (B:  Right)  But, I have no time, you know.  The trouble is no time.  
B:  Are there other Vietnamese ah, boys and girls in the school she goes too, St. Patrick's?  
H:  Yeah, a lot of Vietnamese go to St. Patrick's, because uh, that's a good school.  Because I 
mean good school, because they got more attention, you know, from the teacher.  
B:  Right.
H:  A small school.  
B:  Is there something, anything I missed that you would like to, to say?
H:  [Chuckles]
B:  Something I didn't ask that you think is important?
H:  No.  (B:  No?)  I don't know.  [Chuckles]  You know, this is the first time I talk with someone 
about my country like this.
B:  Really?  It's been very interesting.
H:  I say I talk to ah, I say I talk to my people, because they are Vietnamese.  So they know that.  
(B:  Yes, right)  Yes, we talk sometimes.   
B:  Right.  Are there special problems that you think your people have in adjusting to America?  
H:  No.  [Laughs] 
B:  Just like language?
H:  Yeah.  I mean the, the big problem is the language and the culture, that's all.  Just the 
language and the, maybe some Vietnamese when you know, some, sometime I go out, I uh, I met
some Vietnamese.  They talk to me after I ask them with the Vietnamese language, they answer 
me English.  
B:  Oh.
H:  Because they understand, but they can't talk.  
B:  Oh, I see.  So you have to keep practicing.  
H:  Yeah.
B:  Any language is that way.  
H:  [Chuckles]
