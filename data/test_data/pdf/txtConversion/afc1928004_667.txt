VIE OLD MAN'S DELIGHT EVERY DAY.

Composed and sung by ANDY COLLOM. 
---: 0 :---
When I 
was a 
lad I 
was an unfortunate kid, 
I 
used to get a 
licking for everything I 
did; 
The old man would take me and lay me cross his lap, 
While he used upon me the old leather strap. 
CHORUS. 
Across his knee so gently 
He'd make me holler murder when he'd— 
Oh! that pain I 
cried in vain, 
Holy Moses General Hickory Jackson how :it. 
I 
remember well at school when hooky I 
did play: 
When I 
came home to dinner, there would be the 
deuce to pay; 
Up in the little attic once more he'd make me prance, 
With that old leather strap he wore holes through 
my pants. 
So I 
thought of an idea and I 
soon improved the chance 
Says I 
go it easy pop or you'll bust my Sunday pants. 
'he old man paused a 
moment, then he raised tile strap 
aloft, 
Go into the next room Andy and lake those breeches 
Then once more he'd make me sore, 
I 
used to holler murder when be'd— 
Oh! that pain went through my frame, 
Holy Moses General Jackson how he'd— 
What is it? 
COMIC CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and music 
Sung with great suecess by 
M URPHY and M ACK. 
It's very strange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks 1 
hear about me every day ; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is !" 
SP OK EN— As soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here it 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it ? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chrorno 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
"rwas in the Park, a 
lively mob at rue did talk and stare, 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green ! 
SPOKEN—Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
Look out for it, 
it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum--
What is it, & c. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
pipe, 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPOKEN—Yes, they want to know if I'm natural or artificial, 
and how many of roe there arc in a 
bunch, and whether I'm 
good raw I But abcvgill they wildly ask— 
What is it, & c.

I'm stopping at a 
boarding-house 
Kept by Misses Doyle; 
The rules and regulations 
Are forninst us all the while. 
Two meals a 
day was all We got, 
We set down in a 
line. 
'Twas every man in bed at eight, 
Or locked out after nine. 
CHORUS: 
There was Slotty McGonigal, 
McAllister and O'Burke, 
A Scandinavian tishei man, 
A Norwegian and Turk. 
The ladies, the babies, 
Were crying all the time, 
Every man in bed at eight, 
Or locked out after nine. 
At a 
rousing demonstration, 
Held up in Union Square, 
Tammany Hall Republicans 
And anti-Tarns was thc-
e. 
Our boarders congregated 
To see the sight so fine; 
Gilligan wanted it stopped at eight, 
We got home after nine. 
There was tAlotty, McGonigal, et. 
There waa 2Ictty McGonigal

kicking on the door, 
The ladiee and the babies 
For Miss Doyle did roar. 
We woke up all the neighbors, 
The tailor Constantine 
Turned out the fire department 
When we was locked out after nine. 
There was Slotty McGonigal, oto, 
There was a 
row next morning, 
Wid all the boarders drunk; 
Miss Doyle she got excited 
And threw out every trunk.. 
Hat boxes and valises, 
And shirts from off the line, 
Came out wid all the lodgers 
Bekase we got home after nine. 
There was Slotty If ctGonigal, etc. 
Wid vengeance they did roar; 
They rushed for bricks 
And heavy sticks 
To batter down the door. 
'Twas then they got the collar, 
Three long months wid a 
fine, 
Was their conciliation 
For coming home aftrr ninc.

The Order of Old Bums, 
Written by Jerry Cohan and sung with great success by 
Billy Carter. 
The secret order of oh. . ns, for gall will take the cake. 
They recognize the pass word, it's " What'll von have to 
take ?" 
We likes to drink, we likes to eat, and don't waste drops 
or crumbs, 
Cops and rounders all are on to the order of old bums. 
CHORUS. 
The first degree—charge it to me—then your eye you 
wink, 
The bottle tip, the glass you grip— password—What 0 
ye 
drink ? 
For the back of your neck and the seat of your pants, 
The landlord gently comes, 
And lands you on the sidewalk in the order of old bums. 
When the little cop is staying, in some door way for a 
snooze. 
The " Burns" are on the war-path laying, 
For a 
lunch, a 
grasshopper, or booze, booze, booze. 
THE ORDER OP OLD BUMS.—Continued. 
The watermelon season for a 
change will sometimes suit, 
And when we can't get soft shell crabs why then we'll 
tackle fruit. 
We work the bar for all it's worth till the landlord for us 
comes, 
We furnish politicians from the order of old bums. 
FIRST DEGREE SET TO. 
In the spring time and the summer, 
To the green fields and hen roosts off we goes, 
But in the winter the poor bummer, 
Must hustle in the jail for feed and clothes. I 
suppose. 
SECOND DEGREE SET TO. 
The object of this order is to walk when we can't ride. 
And fill ourselves with lager from the empty keg outside, 
We smoke the best Havana buts, and share 'em with our 
chums. 
And an unprotected clothesline is a Christmas for the 
bums. 
THIRD DEGREE SET TO. 
At election time it is our oyster— 
To the polls we gently, gently stray, 
And of schooners the bum is then a 
holster, 
As he samples with the keg election day. 
What d'ye say.

Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day 
Your huslytnd wasn't the only man sat behind the wail; 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all; 
The Politicians promised him work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a

Ah, six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly 
get, 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him 
yet.

Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, 
Don't give away to the blues, 
You and I

New bonnets and new shoes; 
As for me, I'm done a

No more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times gets better, 
When McGuiness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, the devil take them, why didn't they stay at

Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely

With a

On that night I

While Wiling for the stove. 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door;

I've raised a

From the eldest one, Dan, to the youngest just weaned: 
I've tried all my life to keep them at home, 
But von know that it's some children's nature to roam. 
There's the eldest one, Margaret, who is not yet of age, 
Ban away from her home, and went on the stage; 
But I 
can't blame her much, ' twas her nature you see, 
And, besides, every week she sends money to me.

There's my son. Pat, he could never get fat. 
He'd dance on the corner from morning till night ; 
He'd sing and he'd shout, and he'd wear his shoes out, 
And come home in the morning generally tight. 
Now, he has joined Haverly's big forty stars, 
lie started away with them off on the cars; 
He wears a 
large diamond as big as my hat, 
I'm proud of my son, for an actor is Pat. 
When last he played here, I 
got chuck full of beer, 
And took all the family up to see the fun; 
The band gave a

And this is the kind of a

singer in A

:0: 
We're stout-hearted boys front the green shores of Erin, 
That Emerald set in the sea; 
Where bounteous nature her best (loth appear in, 
And choicest gifts scattered free; 
Her mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
IIer rivers and lakes filled with life in galore; 
Loveliest scenes on all sides are surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
CHORUS: 
Hurrah for that bright, little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar; 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Dear granuail, her daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn; 
Ever in battle her sons they are fearless, 
Death do I 
hold but in scorn; 
Our hearts ever warm to welcome a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turn from your door; 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud, boys, to wear it, 
To it I 
will ever prove true; 
All loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply, indeed, as I 
do 
Distance or climate that bond cannot sever, 
True in our hearts all this wide world o'er; 
The land of St. Patrick, for7et it, no, never! 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore.

Oh, how soon we are forgotten 
In this busy world of ours, 
Though we often strew the pathway 
Of our friends with choicest flowers. 
Ev'ry loving deed and action 
is remembered but a 
while; 
And the thanks are oft as heartless 
As a 
flirting maiden's smile. 
CHORUS. 
Tho' we often strew the pathway 
Of our friends with choicest flow'rs, 
We are very soon forgotten 
In this thankless world of ours. 
Oh, how soon we are forgotten 
in the paths of ;laily life. 
Mouth we aid our lame companions,

JOLLY GOOD LUCK TO ALL. 
sang by NED BARRY at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre Comique 
Music published at E. H. HARDINGS, 229 Bowery. 
If I 
had the power a 
gift to bestow, 
On the friends that around me I 
see, 
I'd give them the very best gift that I 
know, 
The gift that they lucky should be; 
For no matter how clever, how foolish, how wise, 
No matter how great, or how small; 
By luck more than merit, we fall or we rise, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
CHORUS: 
Here's jolly good luck to us all, my friends, 
The best of good luck to us all; 
For by luck more than merit, we rise or we fall 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
One man may be gifted with talents divine, 
But may still in obscurity live; 
While shallower mortals successfully shine, 
And take all the world has to give; 
One waits on in vain, for good fortune's caress,. 
While the other some chance may befall; 
Which used to advantage results in success, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. (Chorus', 
,So, up and be doing, deserving good luck, 
And good fortune may favor the brave; 
For some of life's prizes are won by sheer pluck 
And are lost by the indolent slave; 
There is always one chance in the life of a 
man, 
Which, if lost, he can never recall; 
So work for it, watch for it, hope if you can, 
That there's jolly good luck for us all. (Chorus),

Oh! Aint He got a 
Nose. 
Presented by BONNIE BEN:CELLS to MAJ. E. 
NEWELL, and sung with 
great success. 
Oh: good evening, pay attention, 
And I 
will relate my woes; 
I 
must succeed in making friends, 
Instead of making foes. 
Gaze on a 
wretched mortal, 
Who, no matter where he goes, 
But what some one is sure to cry, 
Oh! aint he got a 
nose. 
CHORUS: 
Oh! aint he got a 
nose, 
What a 
nose, such a 
nose, 
Won't it be ugly 
When it older grows. 
For the people all do cry 
Whenever I 
pass by, 
hoist an umbrella over his nose, 
Oh! aint he got a 
nose. 
Now it really is too bad, 
That I 
was born with such a 
curse; 
And at two minutes old, 
It was discovered by my nurse. 
My eyes were like my daddy's, 
They were startled I 
suppose, 
When she dropped me on the floor, and cried 
Oh: aint he got a nose. ( Chonts). 
And when older grew I 
thought 
I'd 
ettle down in life, 
thought the best thing I 
could do 
it was to take a 
wife. 
I 
popped the question blushingly, 
red as any rose; 
When she looked up in my face, and said 
Oh: aint he got a nose. ( Chorus).

:o. 
Of all the young swells that you ever seen, 
There's none for to equal us two La Da Das; 
We have just come over from the land of the green, 
Where we left the gang and our Ma Mas. 
We are noted for being two bashful young men, 
Especially where ladies are found; 
If you go into any of the fashionable balls, 
You will hear the word go around. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, my! ain't they two babies, 
Look at the swells with the glass on their eye; 
Oh, yes, they're the pets of the ladies, 
Clarence and Arthur, now don't they look fly. 
Now Clarence and Arthur, as everyone knows, 
Drinks wine from the keg as fast as it flows; 
Although we are not lushers that have a 
red nose; 
We go for the bowl as far as it goes. 
We don't care for money although we have none. 
Our parents are very well off; 
We get through on our face; if not on our shape, 
We are Clarence and Arthur the toffs. (Chorus).

Co., Boston, Mass., Price 40eg, 
You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me ; 
But ah! there comes another day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses ; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush ! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day,_ 
The day you will not love me, 
The day you will not love me.. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me ; 
! 
no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget r;ne.

The gray hairs of my mother, 
This tress, this tress recalls them now, 
Again I 
see them cluster, 
In beauty, in beauty round her brow: 
Oh, then, tender are the mem'ries 
That wake from out the past, 
I 
live again life's morning, 
Too beautiful, too beautiful to last. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the gray hairs of my mother! 
This tress, this tress recalls them now, 
Again I 
see them cluster, 
In beauty, in beauty round her brow. 
The gray hairs of my mother, 
This tress recalls them now, 
Again I 
see them cluster, 
In beauty, in beauty 'round her brow, 'round her 
brow.. 
Once more I 
kneel at twilight', 
In childhood's simple, earnest pray'r, 
Once more I 
see the homestead, 
And all, and all the blessings there! 
Oh, lovely tress of silver, 
Whatever cares may be, 
My heart, in all its trials, 
is nearer Heaven, is nearer Tteaven for thee.

But as years roll on, I

How I

But there's one request I'll make, just for my mothers sake 
Don't forget it, attend to it I 
crave; 
And when I'm far away, remember what I 
say, 
Plant Flowers on my Angel Mother's Grave.

Then remember what I 
say, when I 
am far away, 
Ana sailing o'er the dark blue sea ; 
And God may bless you always, if you'll do as I

Pint some Flowers on my Angel Mother's Grave. 
Well put a handsome marble headstone o'er Angel

To remind us of the days gone by; 
we'll have inscribed upon it our Angel Mother, dear,

And ask God to make us strong. and brave; 
When wandering from that spot, plant a Sweet-Forge,-
And some Orange Blossoms on Dear Mother's Grave.

Many Can Help One. 
Sung with great success by HARRY RICHMOND, 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you ; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any 
Remember that many can always help one, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've beard people say, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
'When he is near dying from want ; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't ; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. ( Cho.) 
A man may be wealthy one end of the year 
The next one be wretched and poor; 
lie's struggled his hardest to keep himself up 
But has sunk down to poverty's door; 
Such men as these deserve you-r 
support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. ( Cho 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to- night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place 
A man may be poor but still honest be 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace , 
Then give what you can with a 
generous hear 
No knowing when the tide it may turn • 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the wort], 
An! ' out kin 
sure to return.

Only a

Yet the look in the eyes as they meet mine, 
Still comes to me o'er and o'er. 
Only a

Only a 
word, that was all; 
Yet all day in my heart it echo'd 
Like the sound of an angel's call. 
Only a 
smile of welcome, 
Only a

Yet that smile will still be remembered 
As long as my life shall last 
Only a

Only a

Yet there's naught that this wide world contain. 
Half so dear as this woman to me.

I 
have a 
fine old woman, Jane Riley, don't you see, 
I 
strike her with a 
feather, this Janey she loves me; 
Iler throat is like a 
fountain, her honor she won't cry, 
But, you know, hiding all 
her faults, Jane Riley's 
always dry. 
Crionus: 
Ginger ale, very stale, 
She would order my Danny to go out and o_ty; 
I'm very stout, she would shout, 
I'll keep drinking rock and rye. 
Claret wine, gin so fine, 
She would land down the kettle on the table and ery 
My son Dan, fill the can, 
Her honor, Jane Riley's Dry. 
It 
only very lately Jane Riley's nose got red, 
Sure neither paint or whitewash would whiten Janey's 
head. 
it's when I'm only rising, scarce opening my eye, 
I 
catch her sending out the boy, Jane Riley's always 
dry. 
Her mother often told me, when I 
was young and gay, 
The only thing to keep her still, was to let her have 
her way; 
You see I'm nearly looney, just look you in my eye, 
-Tis a 
big drop of the cratur, Jane Riley's always dry.

THE PULPIT, THE PRESS & THE STAGE 
Written by JERRY COHAN for W ALLY PRICE MOTTO SINGER. 
Of all the great levers that move this world, 
The principal ones are but three; 
And when my strange argument I 
unfold, 
Wise people with me will agree. 
The Newspaper hall keeps rolling on, 
While the Pulpit controls the mind; 
The theories that these powers expound, 
Are moving ones you'll find. 
The Theatre, too, does not fail to improve, 
The wisdom of every age; 
So the principal levers that make the world move, 
Are the Pulpit, the Press, and the Stage. 
Conviction is carried to every one, 
That this life's but a 
fleeting show; 
So Religion is the lever strong. 
To remind us of this, we know. 
Why the veriest hypocrite that can talk, 
And wear sanctimonious ways, 
Let him enter the Pulpit, we listen, and oft 
are persuaded to believe all he says. 
The Christian, the Infidel, no matter what. 
The wicked, good, weak and strong, 
Must acknowledge the Pulpit a 
lever of power, 
And it moves this world along. 
• 
87 
THE PULPIT, 
THE PRESS, 
AND THE STAGE. 
CONTINUED. 
Next comes the Press, a 
most wonderful power, 
That we love, we fear and admire; 
It tells us the doings of every hour, 
And of all events as they transpire. 
Its reviewed by all classes, all nations and men, 
Propounding the wrong and right; 
Observe how the Press has improved the world, 
And brought us from darkness to light. 
It brings closer together all countries apart, 
Of all races of men tis the voice; 
The Press moves the world with unerring power, 
'Tis a 
lever in which we rejoice. 
Next comes the Stage, nature's mirror so true, 
'Tis both criticised, praised and condemned; 
But the Pulpit and Press has abuses, too, 
And the Stage has so much to commend. 
The grandest of minds were its patron's, I'll prove, 
Even those who have worshipped the Press; 
And spoke from the Pulpit the doctrine we love, 
Its Charities cannot grow less. 
So the Stage moves the world with the Pulpit and 
Press, 
In one how ' twill portray a 
whole age; 
And the principal levers that move the world, 
Are the Pulpit, the Press and the Stage.

When silver locks replace the gold, 
I'll love you, darling, as of old. 
And kiss the cheek where bloom'd the rose, 
Ere life had crept so near its close. 
The eyes that were so fair and bright, 
Still shed for me their loving light, 
And on your lips I 
plainly see 
The smile that's always dear to me. 
CHORUS. 
When silver locks replace the.gold, 
I'll love you, darling, as ofgc Id. 
And kiss the cheek where bloom'd the rose, 
Ere life had crept so near its closa. 
When silver locks replace the gold. 
And love with some is growing old, 
I'll cling to you with all my heart. 
And death alone our love shall part; 
Thy face no more with ruby glows, 
The lily has replaced the rose, 
But still you are to me as dear. 
Your voice is just as sweet and clear. 
When silver locks, 
When silver locks replace the gold, 
Our stories oft will be retold, 
And in life's last declining rays 
We'll catch a 
glimpse of other days ; 
The hands that clasped each other true, 
The olden vigor will renew. 
And ' till life's busy dream is o'er 
I'll love you, darling, all the more.

Parody on Babies- 
on Our Block. 
Written and sung by Billy Carter with great sta-Nru!sa 
You can talk of ugly babies, 
On our block it is a 
sight, 
To see a 
thousand babies chaw 
And claw with all their might. 
There is pug-nosed babies, goggle-eyed kids 
And some of the good old stock, 
It's a 
regular menagerie. 
The babies on the block. 
Mrs. Grady's got a 
baby 
That talked before ' twas born, 
Another by the name of Simpson. 
With a 
nose like a 
Wm. goat' horn 
They'll get squalling and bawling., 
And they'd gather in a 
flock, 
Barnum ought to make a 
call 
On the babies on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Johnny Toothpick 
And Susan Turpentine, 
A 
crying and a 
fighting, 
And a 
singing Baby Mine; 
They'd take the chromo cake and all 
For smashing Grandpa's clock, 
They'd win the prize for swallowing flies, 
These babies on our block.

.' ARODY ON BABIES ON OUR BLOCK . —CONTINUED. 
There's an Italian kid just two years old, 
With eyes in the back of his head, 
You can guess how the daddy feels 
When the young one's hair is red ; 
Some have got no eyes, and some have got no nose, 
And a 
black and tan kid 
With an elephant hoof 
And forty-'leven toes; 
Some's dramatic, some's lunatic, 
One kid has a 
wooden ear, 
Another one, they call Napoleon, 
Drinks his barrel of lager beer. 
They'll rear and tare, 
And pull their hair, 
Until your nerves they shock, 
They'll scream and yell, 
And raise old fun, 
The babies on our block. 
Little Sally Falseteeth, 
Sitting in a 
custard pie. 
A 
crying ' cause her little brother 
Slugged her in the eye. 
Rise, Sally, rise, knock his eye out with a 
rock, 
For there's a 
hundred times more babies 
Than there's daddies on our blodk.

ANOTHER GOOD MAN- GONE WRONG. 
Written and sung with immense success at Olympic Theatre, Chicago, 
by FRANK LEWIS. 
Also the Great Hit in New York. 
This world is but a 
race, of men to gain a 
place, 
Of wealth, distinction and a 
happy home; 
Some may conic in way behind, and you'll very often find 
That many a 
noble man is left alone; 
I 
will tell you here to- night, things that pass before my sight 
The mistakes of many folks I'll put in song, 
These words I 
have heard said, or in the papers read, 
They say, another good man has gone wrong. 
In days that now are past, there is one whose name will lat, 
As a 
warning strong to hundreds in our land; 
He was once the Tammany boss, and New York feels his 
loss, 
A 
true friend to the honest workingman; 
Though he robbed our city sure, still he helped our starving 
poor, 
And comfort brought to many a 
pitiful throng; 
'Tis of poor Tweed now I 
sing, but remember just one thing 
lie was but another good man that's gone wrong. 
Throughout this glorious land, you will often find a 
man 
Who has fallen and weaved in a 
depth of crime; 
He possesses manly traits, but is working against fate, 
To a 
life of degradation seems resigned; 
I 
am not out here to preach, but a 
lesson I 
would teach, 
A 
motto I 
would give you in my song; 
Do not pass him with a 
frown, lift him up when he is dowA 
He may have been a 
good man that's gone wrong. 
Our preachers now so meek, they took a 
sudden freak. 
By denouncing an actress of great fame; 
From their pulpits now they preach, and their congrega-
tion teach, 
Sarah Bernhardt is a 
woman of had name; 
In the towa of Montreal, the clergymen there all, 
Denounced her in language loud and strong; 
But if they'd look more to home, they would find among 
their own, 
There is many a 
good old preacher that's gone wrong.

Oh how sadly I

You will never die alone, 
Because I'll never squeal.

Good-bye, mother, sister, brother. 
To this world we bid adieu, 
Do not know us, but disown us, 
We throw no shade on you. 
If we had done as you advised us, 
From bad company staid away, 
Do not cry, we now must die, 
For us we hope you'll pray. 
Good-bye, Jakey, &c.

za entitled, " Dan Maloney's Raffle." 
Nov here is my man, Dan-i-el, 
He comes from Donegal, 
just look at his chin whiskers, 
Now don't he bate them all? 
And if he meets an old-time friend 
He'll always fill the can, 
And when ye seek for blooded stock, 
Dan -

Cuonrs: 
Maloney's my man, now don't he look grani? 
He is down here to-night wid his cronies; 
At raffle or wake, sure he'll take the eakc 
No man in the world is like Maloney. 
Sure he is no day labor - 
r, 
His debts he'll always pay; 
lie hires all his men himself 
At five dollars a 
day. 
Now when the politicians 
They need a

They send for Dan for well they know 
Dan Maloney is the man.

Oh my name is Gilhooly Cornelius Gilh000ly, 
I 
live on the 1st Avenue; 
I'm a 
hard working man from the dear Irish land, 
With a 
heart that is honest and true; 
Every night just before I 
lay down to my rest, 
I 
call to my wife " ducky" dear; 
Run around to Maguire's, it's now I 
desire, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
Cnottu,s: 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer, Mollie. 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer; 
Whem I'm dry it will fill me with cheer, Mollie, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
Then we sit down together and talk of the weather, 
And tell the events of the day; 
When the pitcher is empty, we fill it again, 
And in pleasure the night flies away; 
'rile place where we live is a 
fine Irish flat, 
And our neighbors are full of good cheer; 
If you want to be happy, just come and imbibe, 
From the Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
You may talk of your wines with their high sounding 
names, 
Whisky Punches and Hot Spicy Rum; 
But the Beer is the stuff, and it's quite good enough, 
For your Senses it can't overcome; 
If my friends call arouud, they'll have pleasure and 
fun, 
On a 
Christmas or happy New Year; 
We'll bring out Glass Goblets and off I 
will go, 
For the Little Brown Pitcher of Beer.

The Little Old House on the Rhine.

Air:—" The Old Brown Cot on the Hill," 
Sung by GUS W ILLIAMS. 
1 
remember the days that are now past and gone, 
When a 
child how I 
once loved to play, 
By the side of the mill that stands close by the stream, 
Where for pleasure I 
often would stray. 
But now I've grown old and quite feeble you see, 
And so has my poor Katharine, 
But I 
sigh when I 
think of my once happy days, 
In that little old house on the Rhine. 
CHORUS. 
It was lonely and cold and in winter ' twas drear, 
For the wind would assail it at times, 
Still there's no place on earth to my memory more dear, 
Than that little old house on the Rhine. 
Now the old school house stands just the same as before, 
With the church and its spires so grand, 
Where fond stories of love to each other we'd tell, 
As together we'd walk hand in hand. 
It was there where the old folks for pleasure would stay, 
And bask ' neath the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd return, 
To that little old house on_the Rhine, 
It was lonely, & c. 
They are both dead and gone and they sleep side by side, 
In the grave by the end of the vale. 
Where the birds sweetly sing on a 
bright summer's eve, 
And play in the moonlight so pale. 
Good-bye dear old home, fare you well for awhile, 
You've sheltered me many a 
time, 
Oh ! I'd love to return to my old fatherland, 
And that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely, & c.

And won't I 
look gallus, 
With my swallow- tail coat, 
Double-breasted in the back, 
I'll pay live cents on the steam locomotive 
And to her house I'll rule on the railroad track ; 
I 
expect there will be a band, ( Break.) 
At the depot when I 
land. 
To escort me to my Beckey's house, 
Und then her folks will see, 
Or else a 
half a 
dozen clubs 
Be waiting there for me. 
And if I 
don't get her consent, 
I 
know I 
turn a 
loon, 
And cut my throat with a 
bar of soap; 
That will end me very soon.

Words and Music by DoT. 
l'ublished and copyrighted 1879, by E. H. Harding, 229 Bowery, and sent 
to any address, post-paid, on receipt of 35 cents. 
Sung by J. E. 
M URPHY. of M URPHY & M ACE, as the hit of the season 
in the laughable sketch, entitled ' The Secret." 
There is a 
girl of famous note 
Among the upper nine, 
Considerably comilfo, 
Or something in that line; 
When but a 
child she answered to 
The sudden name of " Nan," 
But now her high tuned monnygram 
Is Bidalia Jane McCann. 
CHORUS. 
Bidalia Jane McCann, the elegant Miss McCann, 
There's none so sweet as her, no girl so neat as her, 
Peggy or Julia, Johanna or Kate, like Bidalia Jane McCann, 
The elegant Miss McCann, I'm sure there's not wan, 
That can bate the bon-ton of Bidalia Jane McCann. 
IIer education's wonderful, 
She spells and writes by ear, 
She plays the " Maiden's Prairie," 
And sings " Beloved Ear." 
She says, " I 
feel so fatigayed 
I 
don't know what to do," 
Says I, " Bidale, some grub and ale, 
Might help your fatigu." 
(Ch,oru.s.) 
She gives a " German" every week, 
And " Irish" too as well, 
She says a 
cork would shade my face, 
So I 
could tend the bell ; 
She sings duets all by herself, 
She talks French like a 
man, 
She's very aureroir indeed, 
Js Bedelia Jane McCann.

Beautiful waltz song written expressly for PAT REILLY by ".Tanim 
O'Neil." Music published and copyrighted by E. H. Harding, 
220 Bowery. 
I'm a 
masher among the shop girls, 
I 
carry on business down-town; 
Every morning at eight me breakfast I 
eat, 
With coffee and doughnuts done brown. 
The ladies they all at me smile, 
For I 
dress in the latest of style; 
And the boys on the street when ever I 
meet, 
Say bow do you do Boquet Doyle. 
CHORUS. 
Boquets I 
wear in my coat,. 
Dasies and Posies and Pink and White roses 
With Perfume I'm ready to choke, 
Oh! carry me out or I'll die. 
I'm out every night till just about dawn, 
And up with the Lark in the morn; 
Sure just before dark I 
walk through the park, 
And feed all the sparrows with corn. 
The Mayor of the city knows me, 
And with him I 
often do dine; 
And whenever I 
meet a 
poor man on the street, 
I 
always do give him a 
dime.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widley known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. 
We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series— Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q  for queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under 
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

C'ourting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to he non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation uu. 
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but. may be enjoyed by evening parties

Unfortunatly, there is 
enough of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, 
when and where to do it." and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting."

neat little 
book, bound in illorrocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt." publisned by A. J. FISHER. No. 24 Vesey Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi ot flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol.

is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might 
afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady. and gentlemen readers."
