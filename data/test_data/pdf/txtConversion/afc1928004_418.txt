Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1878, by A. J. 
FISHER, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
Mr. Johnny DatikhertY. 
, 
Written and sung by HENRY CAluolv, with marked success at.Tony Pas-
tor's Theatre, New York. 
You've all heard of the solid men, 
And men of great renown; 
But if you'll listen for awhile 
I'm certain you will own 
That I'm the most respected man 
In this great town ; and why? 
It is because when I 
walk out 
You will hear the people cry— 
CHoltus. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, the tailor 
A man of great renown ; 
And everybody knows that to make a 
-suit of clothes 
I'm the very best you'll find in all the town-. 
I've heard them say a 
tailor is 
The ninth part of a 
man ; 
Let them get up and knock me 
Into nine parts if they can. 
Devil a 
one would ever dare 
To box me for a 
foe, 
For I 
can box as yell as stitch, 
As very well they know. 
I'm 'gr. Johnny Dougherty, &c. 
Written and sung by H ENRY CARNEY, with great applause. 
There's a 
dear little spot call'd the Emerald Isle. 
And there one fine day I 
was born, 
So that is the reason my blood always boils 
When people speak of it with scorn; 
Her sons and her daughters are gallant and fair, 
And the country itself is so grand 
That I 
cannot imagine why people should speak 
In dispraise of my dear native land. 
CHORUS. 
So—__ 
for old Ireland, the land of my birth, 
Her sons have gained famous renown, 
'Tis known as a 
glorious picture on earth, 
So I 
won't hear old Ireland run down. 
I'm sure that no Irishman ever need be 
Ashamed of those heroes gone by, 
Who fought like true Irishmen only can do 
When foes of their country were nigh 
And in modern times, when for England thay fought, 
They were foremost and first in the fray, 
And at the Crimea, when danger was near, 
Pat never kept out of the way. 
So— Hurrah for oh l 
Ireland, & c. 
The names of O'Connell, and all such as he, 
Should make every Irishman proud; 
They were Ireland's heroes, and showed that they were 
With wit and with wisdom endowed ; 
They spoke for their country. as every man should, 
No matter what country or creed; 
So we never need be ashamed of Ireland's sons, 
For they provcd I 
rue in thought, word and deed.

Nancy Mooney. 
Written and sung by " H ENRY CARNEY " 
with great success. 
Ochone, weirasthrue ! sure my heart's nearly breaking; 
Farewell of my senses I'm sure I 
am taking ; 
Thro' thinking of Nancy, asleep or awaking, 
I'm just like a 
long fishing rod. 
My bosom with anger and sorrow does throb, 
Aich breath that I 
take is turned into a 
sob ; 
I'm as wake as a 
drink of could water, by gob, 
I 
wish I 
Nva under the sod. 
CHORUS. 
Desateful Nancy Mooney, of me you've made a 
looney, 
You know since we were childther on you I've been spooney; 
If you don't dhrop gallavantin' widi that blackguard, Mickey 
Rooney, 
I'll dhrown myself, and thin my ghost will haunt you night 
and day. 
Ochone, weirasthrue ! black-eyed Nancy Machree. 
I 
know you're too good for a 
fellow like me; 
But as sure As the birds love the leaves on the tree 
I 
love you far dearer than life. 
If you'll only become Mrs. Mulligan soon 
I'll sing like a 
bird in the sweet month of June, 
And I'll hop on one leg from Drumlish to the moon 
The day that I 
make you my wife. 
Desateful Nancy Mooney, & c. 
Altho' I 
am delicate, lonely, and wake, 
I'll smash every skull in the land for your sake, 
I'll pitch the ould castle right into the lake, 
I'll ride Prince O'Donoughue's horse. 
I'll swear by all colors—black, yaller, or red,— 
That I'll smash like a 
turnip Mick Rooney's big head ; 
You have broke my poor heart—och, I 
wish I 
was dead, 
Chen you might shed a 
tear o'er my corse.

The New York Lasses. 
Written and sung by H ENRY CARNEY with great success. 
Oh, I'll sing in the praise of the New York young lasses— 
Such charming young creatures are they— 
For somehow or other, ' twixt one and another 
My heart has been stolen away. 
It's no use one sighing, tho' hard I 
am trying, 
I 
can't tell wherever it's gone ; 
For the great and the small ones, the short and the tall ones, 
I'm in love with them all, every one. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the New York lasses for me, 
With their hearts and their eyes full of glee ; 
I'm in love with them all, both the short and the tall, 
So the New York young lasses for me. 
Their sweet, smiling faces, as fresh as the daisies, 
Would captivate any man's heart. 
Tho' in beauty they're blooming, and quite unassuming, 
And act as they should woman's part; 
Their eyes glisten brightly, their ways are so sprightly, 
Their modesty none can surpass ; 
Tho' it may perhaps look tiring, I 
can't help admiring 
Those pretty young girls as they pass. 
Oh, the New York young lasses, &c. 
They trip like the fairy, so graceful and airy, 
They look so enchanting and pure ; 
At their darning and stitching they look so bewitching—. 
More like angels than mortals, I'm sure— 
They have such pretty features, these lovel) young creatures, 
That hearts made of stone they would break, 
If one would me marry no longer I,d tarry, 
And a 
good husband, too I 
would make. 
Oh, thc New YorI. young lasses, & c.

Wheif the Rooster Crows: 
Written and sung by HENRY CARNEY. The greatest hit of the season. 
I 
love to roam in the bright green fields, 
I 
like to live at a 
farm, 
I 
love to stroll where the primroses grow, 
For a 
country life is a 
charm. 
I 
love to wander through the old farm yard, 
Round by the old haystack, 
And listen to the chicks, as they cackle, cackle, cackle, 
And the pretty little ducks, quack, quack_

Quack, quack goes the pretty little ducks, 
The hen's cackle is a

When the old rooster crows everybody knows 
There's eggs for your breakfast in the morning.

I 
love to roll on the grass.

Quack, quack, & c: 
Written and sung with great success by HENRY CARNF.Y, at Tony Pastor's 
Theatre, New York. 
There's a 
day that comes but once a 
year—the 17th of March, 
And uppn it every Irishman is drinking ; 
All the girls are dressed so gay, and the pipers—how they 
play! 
And the boys at all the pretty girls are winking. 
Then we all put on the green, and we just feel all serene, 
While the shamrock in our button holes adorning ; 
And every mother's son makes his mind up for some fun 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
CHORrs. 
Then shout Hurrah for Erin, the land that gave me birth, 
And the darling little shamrock don't be scorning ; 
Such a 
sight ye've never seen as the wearing of the green 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
Upon St. Patrick's eve, when our daily work we leave, 
Every Irishman is frolicsome and frisky ; 
He's a 
coin or two to spend, and another for to lend, 
And at home he's got a 
stinging taste of whiskey. 
At night he goes to Led feeling quare about the head, 
And he snores until the day is gently dawning ; 
Then he wakes and rubs his eyes, and then " liedad," he cries, 
" 
It's St. Patrick's day in the morning." 
Then shout Hurrah, &:c 
And when parade begins, och, it's murther for our shins, 
Such hustling and bustling and squeezing ; 
Then of drink there's such a 
lot, and it's always thundering 
hot, 
So there's little chance of anybody freezing. 
Then the band and pipes are blowin' to the chune of " Garry 
Owen,'' 
to have another chune we would be scorning • 
It's the finest bit of spree that ever you did see 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning.

Some Girls Do and Some Girls Don't. 
Of all the strangest girls on earth, 
I 
think my girl's the one ; 
You know she has peculiar ways, 
And quite devoid of fun. 
She never sees a 
joke of mine, 
Whenever humor flows, 
But gives me a 
disdainful look 
And quite turns up her nose. 
SPOKEN— Sonic girls like a 
little joke, you know, but miii . 
don't, she turns her nose up at it. 
I 
think she works it o 
the same principle as this (herning lip nose with _fiver). 
CHORUS. 
Some girls do, and some girls don't, 
Some girls will, but my girl won't ; 
I 
tried very hard to see if she would, 
She said she really couldn't, and I 
don't think she could 
I 
took my love to see the play, 
As other fellahs do ; 
And thought that she'd enjoy herself, 
She cried the whole night through. 
And when we reached the street again, 
Some oysters I 
proposed, 
But she said, " No, not me, young man,” 
Still turning up her nose. 
SPOKEN— Up it 
Saddle Rocks, just 
nose at five cents 
went again at three dozen of the bes; 
think of that. 
To see a 
girl turn up her 
a time. 
I 
said, " Well, my love, if you 
13 
won't have any supper, we will have a 
cab and go home." 
She replied, '' No, young man, no four- wheeled cabs for me 
at this time of night." 
Some girls do, &c. 
We met one Sunday afternoon, 
For a 
day in Central Park ; 
And when we mounted " One tree hill" 
We had, well, say a 
lark ! 
'Georgina said, " You know, young man, 
Some girls prefer a 
stroll ; 
Not me, when I'm in Central Park 
I 
dearly love a 
roll!" 
SPOKEN—Now, there's an extraordinary girl for you. 
Of 
course, I 
wanted to take her for a 
nice quiet lover's walk in 
some shady lane, hut she said she'd prefer a 
roll. 
Then I 
wanted to talk to her of love, romance, and poetry, but no, 
she said she'd " sooner have a 
good dinner." 
Well, 
Some girls do, & c. 
Not long ago my uncle died 
And left me fifty pounds; 
As soon as I 
received the news 
My joy it knew no bounds. 
I 
thought, well, I 
will marry now, 
So I 
at once proposed; 
But when I 
mentioned the amount 
Up went her lovely nose. 
SPOKEN—The had girl, she said she ouf4ht to have five 
hundred with such a 
man as me. 
I 
thought she would have 
jumped at me, you know, for, 
Some !yids do, S:c.

Count The Cost. 
Written an" sung by HAR RY BECKWITH, "America'
s 
Comuinc.', 
tet 
here's many maxims quaint and old 
find to-day quite new, 
And though we oft have heard them told, 
Yet they are good as new. 
While looking over them one day, 
This one I 
came across: 
'Let Life's affairs be what they may, 
Tis best to count the cost." 
CHORUS. 
iThen always count the cost, 
Yes, always count the cost ; 
,'.Bear this in mind, don't go it blind, 
But stop and count the cost. 
iris quite the fashion nowadays 
To go it rather fast ; 
Excesses in a 
hundred ways 
The health of many blast. 
The fruits of toil or wealth, perhaps, 
Is from them idly tossed ; 
,But by and by a 
grand collapse 
Will make them count the cost. 
Then always count the cost, & c. 
Perhaps a 
simple life to you 
Seems not a 
blissful state, 
And so you find, as many do, 
Some day, perhaps, a 
mate. 
Now marriage is quite well, but still 
Love's labor will be lost 
And wedlock prove a 
bitter pill 
Unless you count the cost. 
Then always count the cost. & c. 
Each day we see some splendid chance 
Our money to invest, 
And hopes of gain our soul enchants, 
So then we make the test ; 
In stocks, and bonds, and savings banks. 
We think it can't be lost; 
Some day you'll find that Fortune's pranks 
r
-.Wil1 make you count the cost.

The beau ideal of loves, 
With his hair so black and curly, 
And his whitest of white gloves,

With his Baton in his hand, 
And leads the Instrumentalists, 
In a 
style that I 
think grand. 
CHO.— 
They play such jolly music, 
Waltz, Polka and Quadrille; 
And sometimes play so feelinglro 
It gives me quite a

The Leader sometimes gives a

And looks as though he's rash ; 
And then they play so soft and sweet, 
And after comes a 
crash.

Gliding up the stream. 
To wear a

Oh I 
what a 
gawk, to leave NeW York, 
And go gliding up the stream. 
They put him in the baker's— 
My Willie pure as snow, 
And made him count the raisins, 
And stamp down all the dough; 
They cut his curly ringlets, 
Yes, shaved his head off clean, 
To make him look respectable, 
After gliding up the stream. 
Gliding up, etc, 
When Will came from the prison, 
He floated in a 
tank, 
He landed in Astoria, 
On Long Island's grassy hank ; 
He fell down on his benders, 
So had his eye did gleam. 
Saying. 
You'll never catch-ee me no more-ee, 
Gliding up the stream."

From the clime where I

Alai my ol i

OH my song is of a 
nice young man, 
Who's name was Johnny Glass, 
He was a 
glazier by trade- and the stamps he made 
As through back streets he'd pass. 
1344 started in life, with patty and knife, 
And a 
big pane of glass to begin, 
He was fat as a 
hub and fond of his grub. 
And he hallooed out ‘. glass put in." 
he'd rise with the lark, and from daylight till da: 
He'd trudge through wind and rain; 
By the light of the lamps, he'd count his stamps, 
Next morning he'd be off again. 
'Twas joy to his soul, when he spied a 
hole, 
Or a 
window patched with tin, 
With his eyes rolled up he'd yelp like a 
pup, 
"Do you want any glass put in ?" 
At length he fell deep in love, 
But the fault was not all his own, 
He got shot through the heart with cupid's dart, 
By a 
little Dutch girl half growu, 
With a 
huge large paw she broke his jaw, 
WhenPais keg was half full of gin, 
As he rolled in the dirt, she cries, where is you hurt ? 
, 
And his answer was " glass put in. ' 
Oh, he made her his frou, but I 
can't tell you how 
They passed a 
honeymoon; 
The pork was all hot boiling in the pot, 
As he toddled home that noon. 
Years rolled by, three children did cry--
Two boys and a 
girl, what a 
sin, 
Oh they christened the last Miss Put in Glass, 
And the boys they called Glass Put In.

And the smile she gave as I

She Was Just About the Age. 
Sung by HARRY BECKWITH. 
Oh once I 
dearly loved a 
girl, her name was Sarah Green, 
No rarer girl, 
o 
fairer girl, than Sarah should be seen, 
Seventeen years old, need you be told, for a 
sweetheart she'd 
a 
rage, 
But then of course she would you know, she was just about the 
age, 
CHORUS. 
But then of course she would you know, she would you know, 
she would, 
But then of course she would you know, she \vas just about

She lived a 
little way from town, it wasn't very far, 
And with her dwelt a 
cross old man altho' he was her pa ; 
One day when her papa was out I 
went to hers to dine, 
And in my pocket for a 
treat, I 
took a 
quart of wine. 
CHORUS. 
For she liked wine, she would you know, she would you know, 
she would, 
But then of course she would you know, she was just about 
the age. 
We sat and talked a 
little while and after we had dined, 
I 
for a 
little drop of wine felt mightily inclined, 
When a 
rat- tat we heard at the door, and she to me did rus„, 
And pushed me in the cupboard and ' twas then I 
saw her blush. 
But then of course she would you know, she woulo you know, 
she would, 
But then of course she would you know, she was just about the 
age.

Her father then came in, and talked for half ln hour or more, 
And she sat leaning all the while against the cupboard door, 
When the wine flask in my pocket broke and made a 
precious 
mess, 
Ran underneath the cupboard door, all found her new silk 
dress. 
CHORUS. 
For she wore silk she would you know, she would you know, 
she would, 
But then of course she would you know, she was just about 
the age. 
Her father saw the flowing wine, and said: " Sarah, what 
is that ?" 
She said : " Some jam and pickle jars are broken by the cat." 
lie opened then the cupboard door, exclaiming, " Who

And I 
was in a

In all this wide world round,

There's a

And a

She's loved by the rich and the poor, 
She is free front all dark design, 
She's welcome at every door— 
There's no such girl as mine.

She is light to the banquet ball, 
She's balm to the couch of care;

W AY down in dear old Charleston, in South Carolina State, 
In that dear old spot we passed our happiest days. 
It's there we had a 
home that we once called our own, 
But on that old home we never more shall gaze. 
We together often sat in the doorway of our cot, 
A. listening to the niggers in the cane; 
But now we're left alone this wide world for to roam, 
For we'll never see that good old home again.

Oh, it's often we regret, and 
That good old home we'll

or in pain. 
try hard to forget, 
never see again. 
In this home we loved so well we with happiness did dwell 
But, alas each one soon bore a 
heavy heart, 
For a 
cloud soon overspread and hovered overhead, 
Which caused our happy family to part. 
Old mosso and old missa to the angels they have gone, 
ln happiness and bliss there to remain; 
While we are quite forlorn, and left here for to mourn 
For that good old home we'll never see again. 
Then give me this old wife, etc. 
The colored folks' delight was on a 
summer's night 
To sing and dance for hours upon the green; 
We those old hoofs could shake, when a " walking for dat 
cake," 
Though we think sometimes the past. was but a 
dream. 
Now that we're turning gray, and soon must pass away, 
As in youth, together in old age remain 
Until the day does come that our work on earth is done; 
We'll think no more of that good old home again. 
Then give me this old wife, etc.

Take it Bob, take it. its better than tea. 
I

Ile died at the age—well, say twenty-four. 
And I 
heard the folks ' round me say,

And although T

was dying with thirst. 
A bottle of brandy close by I 
could see, 
'Twas meant for the mourners, it was'nt for me, 
And as on my bed still and sib. mit. I

In the distance distinctly F

But you know the °lit saying that never ileecives— 
What the eye does .nt see, the heart lleVer grieves. 
I

Now don't ask me to drink before I

Floating over the land that is free, 
Since the Goddess of Liberty's cradle was rocked 
On the shores of the Isle of the Sea. 
With a 
dark field of blue and a

Bespangled with stars bright as gold— 
Centennial present from brave hearts now still—

And when Liberty, crushed by the grim tyrant's hand, 
Lay panting and bleeding alone, 
Ere the brave hearts had rallied around our dear land, 
And had offer'd their blood to atone. 
And the Angel of love, looking down from above, 
Deopped tears on the blue oceo.n cold, 
And plashing that flag, they eufigured each star 
On this

While we smoke our clear Havana, 
Then we'll let the champagne flow.

'Twas on One Sunday eve, 
I 
thought I 
would relieve 
My busy mind by strolling through the park; 
When I 
met as if by chance, 
And caught a 
roguish glance, 
Of a 
charmer who seemed bent upon a 
lark. 
She was resting ' neath a 
tree, 
When first she looked at me, 
And of course my bounden duty was to smile; 
And quick it was returned, 
Oh! how my cheeks they burned, 
For this fair one was the paragon of style. 
CHORUS, 
'Twas ' neath an oak tree grand, 
While list'ning to the band, 
Perhaps a 
pleasant hour to beguile ; 
When we met as if by chance, 
And she threw a 
roguish glance, 
For this fair one was the paragon of style. 
Kind friends, you've heard my song, 
And with it each detail 
Of our friendship, which was very short and sweet; 
And now I 
guess I'll go, 
But before I 
do I'll show 
A 
step I 
think it's very hard to beat. 
But on our wedding day, 
Which is not far away, 
We hope you'll come and stay a 
little while; 
And then you all can see 
How happy we can be, 
Together as the paragon of style.

One morning they walked off to church all serene,

They haven't a

But tells his young wife that there's time enough yet. 
They've a 
cot out of town where for light they've no lamp, 
But he's best pleased when living in town, the old scamp 
For he says, it's a

To turn off the gas at the meter.

Song and Dance by E. I). Cloontmo. 
Sung by .Tonwly W ELD. 
THE sweetest of joys in life, 
At least to me ' tis so, 
Is to have some pretty girl—some brilliant little pearl, 
To tell you she'll have you for her beau. 
I 
met my angel at a 
ball, 
And of course in love we did fall, 
She said she would accept me, and she never could forgot me, 
Of course I 
couldn't help what I 
did, 
I 
placed my arm [s3,-tn.] 
But I 
meant no harm, [sym.] 
For I 
couldn't help doing what 
We passed very many pleasant iiourA. 
For I 
thought my love so kind, 
Until last Sunday night at her house I 
saw a 
sight, 
Which has caused a 
sudden change in My mind. 
My Nancy was out in the yard, 
Oh, to tell you the truth, it is hard, 
And beside this tickle dove—was a 
barber making love, 
And of course I 
couldn't help what I 
did; 
stood amazed, _ s3 in.] 
My hair all raised, [sym.] 
And I 
couldn't help doing what f ( lid. 
I 
challenged him to light with me next day, 
For I 
thought it was lny place to do it then. 
For she said she'd never harbor—any love for that, ere harbor, 
And vowed I 
was the dearest of the men. 
But when we took our places for the tight, 
The barber showed a 
letter she did write, 
Where she said I 
was a 
fool and she used me as a 
tool, 
And of course she couldn't help what she ( lid. 
So off I 
straddled, [spit.] 
And for home skedaddled, [ syni.]

I 
met a 
young lady this morning, 
While taking a 
stroll on the street, 
She was dressed in the height of fashion, 
With shoes too small for her feet, 
Her teeth were false and so was her hair, 
Her cheeks ( with paint) were aglow, 
I've heard her pa pa was a 
dealer in rags. 
But she only does it for show. 
You will see a 
young man with an ulster, 
Cutting a 
swell on the street, 
He will say his `• uncle' is wealthy, 
When in fact he's had nothing to eat, 
What kind of clothes he has under 
None of us will know, 
But we do know he has a

But he only wears them for show. 
There are rich men who live in our city, 
Whose thousands roll in at their feet, 
Who hold the fiont pew on a

And scorn at the wretch in the street, 
Sometimes he bas acatn‘e to be liberal, 
Through the papers large sums lie bestow,

Since the dark river of Death we have crossed 
Will not the unbidden tears sometimes start, 
As 3

Here, in our prison of silence and gloom ; 
Still we number our life's Sunny noon ; 
'When you have laid us to rest in the tomb, 
Are we forgotten, forgotten so soon ? 
CHORUS. 
When the grave receives its trust— 
Earth to earth, and dust to dust— 
Are we at once from your nauory torn — 
Are we forgotten so soon when we're gone? 
Think how we cherished and loved you on earth, 
Watched o'er your footsteps with tenderest care; 
'Wept in your sorrow, rejoiced in your mirth— 
Welcome no pleasure which you did not share. 
Give us, again, our lost place in your heart ; 
Keep the sweet chords of affection in tune, 
When for the realms of shadows we part; 
Are we forgotten, forgotten so soon? 
CHOPUS. 
When the last fond tie is broken— 
When the last farewell is spoken— 
Are we at once from your memory torn;

As originally done by QUEEN and W EST, at the San Francisco

ALL around this blessed town we run for information, 
Trying to discover if there's any new sensation. 
Politics and accidents, and scandalizing too, 
These are all the same to us as long as they are new.

Here and there and everywhere, we'll very quickly prove, 
Do what we will we are never still, but always on the move. 
Here and there and everywhere, you'll see at a

Do what we will we're never still, but always on the dance. 
Mr. Beecher asked us if we would be his Mate, 
He would preach, and we would have to pass around the plate ; 
To sing a 
comic song or two, to please the congregaltion--
Anything is fair, said he, to raise a 
good sensation. 
Here and there, etc. 
A 
lessee of a 
theater, in manner most emphatic, 
Told us that we must not dance, because it was dramatic. 
Such petty jealousy, of course, arises from vexation, 
'Cause variety shows are all the go they feel a 
queer sensation: 
Here and there, etc. 
Now we must be going, but on some other day 
About the great sensation we'll have some more to say.

But there is no such thing that I

As that charming game of billiards, 
I 
play it by night and by day, 
In that game I'm excelled by a

By the good handling of the cue. 
There's another style of ' blood," boys, 
That lives in this great town, 
Who makes an easy living

GIVE BREAD TO THE POOR. 
As sung with tremendous success at the New National Theatre, 
Philadelphia, by FRANK LEWIS. 
I've an object in view I 
would like to unfold, 
It's about this great city that's revelled in gold. 
The pride of our nation well tested above, 
In Philadelphia's great city of brotherly love. 
In the famine of late, though ' tis hard for to state, 
The thought of starvation, anti sad was the fate 
Of the many poor families who hail nothing in store, 
Till a 
cry came from Heaven, " Give bread to the poor!" 
Now, there's A. T. Stewart, the New York millionaire, 
Who some time ago sought another world's care, 
Would it have hurt his kind heart to throw out a 
dime 
To keep our poor sufferers from prison and crime? 
He invested, I'm told, in a 
great institute, 
In a 
matter of business, yon bet he was cute•, 
He was not like Jita Fisk, nor will be maily more, 
With his lightning express giving bread to the poor 
There's another kind heart, tho' he has been misused, 
In South Carolina, where all was confused ; 
He kept down the riot, gave his (Alice for peace, 
While the Rads, in the White House, they sat at thelrease. 
In the town of Columbia, which all of you know, 
Their suffering was great with hunger and woe; 
With his shirt sleeves rolled up, like old Jackson at war, 
N Stood Governor Wade Hampton giving bread to the poor.,

They told him, gently she was gone, 
And spoke of Heav'n and grain', 
And drew him from the lonely room, 
Where lay the lovely child. 
'Twas all in vain, he heeded not 
Their pitying looks of sorrow, 
" 
Hush !" hush !" he said, 
she only sleeps, 
She'll wake again to-morrow !" 
"Hush ! hush !" he said, 
she only sleeps, 
She'll wake again to-morrow !" 
They laid her in a 
lowly grave, 
Where winds blew high and bleak, 
Tho' the faintest summer breeze had seem d 
Too rough to fan her cheek: 
And there the poor old man would watch, 
In strange and childish sorrow, 
And whisper to himself the words, 
" 
She'll come again to-morrow !" 
He'd. whisper to himself the words, 
"She'll come again to-morrow!" 
One day they missed him long, and sought 
Where most he lov'd to stray, 
They found him dead, upon the turf 
Where little Nelly lay : 
With tott'ring steps he'd wander'd there, 
Fresh hope and strength to borrow, 
And e'en in dying, breath' d 
the pray'r, 
" 
Oh ! let her come to-morrow !" 
The old man, dying, breath'd the pray'r,

WIEN THE BELLS ARE RINGING 
As sung by DELEHANTY & Cumamaas. 
A 
story I 
will tell you, 
My heart is beating so, 
For love is such a 
funny thing ; 
But that yon all must know. 
The object of affection 
That stole my heart away, 
Is a 
charming, darling little girl, 
I 
think you all will say. 
CHORUS. 
When the bells are ringing, 
Oh how happy I 
will be ; 
Then I'll be married 
And she'll belong to me. 
I 
know she loves me dearly, 
For she often told me so ; 
And she's the sweetest and the neatest, 
Prettiest girl I 
know. 
But now I 
have to leave you, 
I 
know she's on the street : 
I 
told her when we parted last 
The day that we should meet 
But if you doubt my story, 
And think she won't be mine, 
The wedding bells the sequel 
The first day that is tine.

NEW YORK SOCIETY. 
Am.—London S)ciety. 
As sung by JOHNNY MA1ZKS. 
s 
THINK I've travelled everywhere, and seen what's to be seen 
Wherever I 
may roam I 
make myself at home, 
I've flirted down to Long Branch to Newport I 
have been, 
To Saratoga, Rwkaway and to Rome; 
I've seen society in every shape and form, 
I've watched the tide of fashions rise and fall; 
I've viewed it in its calm, I've seen it in its storm, 
And this is my conclusion after all. 
Cnont:s. 
Baden Baden Spa, France and Germany, 
Liverpool Gr London, Spain or Italy; 
In such society there's much variety, 
But nothing equals New York society. 
Society as soon as the New York season's o'er, 
Will to the sea run down, where in a 
bathing gown, 
It dabbles in the water or perhaps upon the shore, 
It yawns and wishes it was back in town, 
And though it may be nice to drink the nasty waters, 
And lose your money gambling at the Spa. 
And meet the sort of men you'd cm at any place, 
The New York season I 
prefer in' far. 
Baden Baden Spa, ttc... 
ociety I've met with in old Ireland, mid the bogs,

In Mount St. Bernard convent, with the monks and jolly dogs,

Pilt there's a

TOUR POCKET-BOOK IS YOUR BEST 
FRIEND. 
Music Published by E. 
H. 
HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. T. 
Price 10 cents. 
Worth by ARTHUR W . 
FRENCH. 
Music by A. 
CULL. 
There are friends you deem true, they will linger near you, 
In the flush of prosperity's hours, 
But in poverty's day, they will vanish away, 
Like the fading of summer's sweet flowers. 
As you journey along in life's turbulent throng, 
While the hill sides you climb or descend. 
You will see it some day, I 
am right when I 
say 
That your pocketbook is your best friend; 
That your pocketbook is your best friend. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis a 
friend that you need, and a 
true friend indestd, 
Ever ready to give or to lend; 
For wherever you go, you will find it is so, 
That your pocketbook is your best friend; 
That your pocketbook is your best friend. 
Our political life is nothing but strife, 
Where all honor is swallowed in gain; 
But to hint such a 
thing to a 
man of the ring, 
Why of course they would call you insane. 
Many a 
man is in power at this very same hour 
That our honest votes never would send: 
And the way it is done is quite plain to each one, 
Why their pocketbook was their best friend. 
'Tis a 
friend, etc. 
There's a 
gay young cashier, with a 
thousand a 
year, 
And his horses and ladies and wine, 
Oh, he goes at a 
rate quite alarming to state, 
Though he draws on a 
very big mine. 
They discover, some day, he has gambled away 
Many thousands or more, and the end 
Is, they give him a 
year, after that he gets clear, 
For his pocketbook is his best friend. 
'Tis a 
friend, etc.

American Fortune- Telling Cards.--This is me old. 
set and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
jpublished it for years. and the demand ms continually increasing. 
These Cards are arr ng a and prieted in series—H. arts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and eau des— and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and uumbers 1, 3. to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to direetions. 
Many ot the an-
ewers depend upon the position eertai u 
cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but t direetants have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
atanding. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the IL S. 
Hnclosed in handsome case..

Courting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
an meet a 
want fiequeetly felt by young people—a want of means or 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are \ 
isited by gentlemen who are either too die. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upun asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by ceetom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result 01 this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
*adieus existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of cp.estions and answers, will cover even-
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
