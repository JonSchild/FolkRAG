Nickerson:  Okay. So this is Ginger Nickerson. And I am interviewing Paul Tomasi at the Northeast 
Kingdom Waste Management District in Lyndon, Vermont. And it is August 31, 2018. So Paul, could 
you tell me roughly when and where you were born? 
 
Tomasi:  Oh, sure. Well, I was born in Washington, Pennsylvania in 1966. 
 
00:34 
 
Nickerson:  Okay. And what is your current job and how long have you been doing it? 
 
Tomasi:  I am the executive director of the Northeast Kingdom Waste Management District. And I’ve 
been in this position since 1999. 
 
Nickerson:  And can you tell me what you were doing before this job? 
 
Tomasi:  I was the supervisor for solid waste management for the United States Antarctic program. 
 
Nickerson:  Oh my gosh! (laughs) So how did you get into that job? 
 
Tomasi:  Well, just, I knew people. I was working as an environmental consultant in Rhode Island. And 
someone that I had gone to college with at Lyndon State College had already joined the United States 
Antarctic program, and asked me if I wanted to go to Antarctica. So you don’t get those kind of calls very 
often, so I went.  
 
Nickerson:  (laughs) Okay. So I’m going to have to ask you some about that. 
 
Tomasi:  Oh, sure. 
 
Nickerson:  What was it like managing waste in Antarctica? 
  
Tomasi:  Well, oddly enough, it wasn’t a lot different than here, except that you know, obviously we have 
trees and it’s a little warmer. But the Antarctic summer isn’t much different than a Vermont winter. You 
know, it had some challenges, obviously, because of where we were and the climate. But because it’s a 
fairly small community, we had much greater control over you know, what came on continent and how it 
left the continent. So in that regard, I felt like we had a lot of impact on waste diversion, because one of 
the first things that happened when you arrived in Antarctica was you went through a waste management 
orientation. There were other orientations once you got off the plane. But we had a small video. And then 
we would talk to the groups that came in and say, “You’re going to see a lot of containers, but this is the 
way it has to be done.” And for the most part, everybody participated. 
 
2 
 
Nickerson: Wow. Had you been involved with waste management prior to that job?  
 
Tomasi:  Not really. I had worked for an environmental consulting firm. But my background is in 
environmental science, so it was of interest to me. But that’s how I got involved in the waste management 
field was the Antarctic program. 
 
 
Nickerson:  Wow. So you said you were able to control what people brought onto the continent and left? 
(laughs)  
 
Tomasi:  Yeah. I mean, it was under a contract from the National Science Foundation. So there were 
restrictions on what could be brought to the continent. And everything arrived on either military transport 
planes or the annual resupply vessels. So once a year, a ship would come from California and resupply the 
base. When you order materials, you try to do that with “what am I going to do with it?” in mind. Which 
you know, I wish more people would do. But we were pretty successful in doing that in Antarctica, to try 
and minimize the amount of waste that showed up there in the first place. 
 
Nickerson:  So what were some of the things that were restricted? 
 
Tomasi:  Well, you know, chemicals, I think, primarily. Although because a fair amount of scientific 
research occurs down there, there are a certain number and type of chemicals that were used to process 
experiments and things like that. But we’d try to avoid things with excessive packaging.  
 
One thing that we struggled with was wood. Because a lot of materials had to be crated for the 
long journey. And then we had to try and get all that wood back to the United States. But we implemented 
some programs so that once the crates arrived in Antarctica, some of them could be reused to ship out to 
the remote field locations. So we were trying to you know, basically scavenge what we could so that we 
didn’t have to order excessive supplies.  
 
One of the interesting things, though, about Antarctica was after the Korean War, a number of 
items, just bizarre things, like Studebaker parts, and Kirby vacuum cleaners, I don't know why they were 
in Korea, but they ended up in Antarctica. Maybe because it was such a shorter journey. But while I was 
there, we were trying to work through a backlog of some of these obsolete things, ship them to the state of 
Washington, and resell them. And oddly enough, you sit on automotive parts that haven’t been made in 
40 years, there’s actually a value. And because Antarctica is dry, everything was rust-free. So we were 
able to move a lot of material back to the states and find homes for it.  
 
Nickerson:  So that sort of leads me to my next question. Obviously you weren’t letting things stay in 
Antarctica. Where did you put them? Where did they go next? 
 
Tomasi:  Well, we had a facility, oddly enough, that looked a lot like the facility we have here in 
Lyndonville, where we would bale materials. Everything arrived on the resupply vessel in shipping 
containers. So as you’re emptying shipping containers throughout the season, we would reload them with 
processed recyclables. In some cases, waste that couldn’t be recycled. And when the resupply vessel 
comes in February, everybody’s alert and you work around the clock to get the boat or the ship unloaded 
and then reloaded with the waste. And they’re hauled back to Washington. And a contractor is— 
 
Nickerson:  Washington State or Washington, DC? 
 
Tomasi:  Washington State. A contractor awaits all the materials and then acts as a broker to ship 
cardboard to a mill and handle virtually everything that comes off the ship. Yeah, it’s quite a project. 
 
3 
 
Nickerson:  Wow. Wow. I have hundreds of questions about Antarctica, but I’m going to just ask you a 
couple more and then move on to Vermont. What was your favorite part of working in Antarctica, in that 
job? 
 
Tomasi:  Wow. You know, it was pretty interesting that the sun just circled the horizon during the austral 
summer. So that was kind of neat. I guess fortunately I didn’t have to stay over the winter, which would 
have been 24 hours dark. Which probably would have been interesting as well. But just the bright 
sunshine every day was pretty neat.  
 
And you get to meet people from other countries. Because we were kind of the arrival point for a 
number of other international stations. So it was pretty interesting. 
  
Nickerson:  And what was your least favorite, or the most challenging part about that job there? 
 
Tomasi:  Well, I guess trying to get the resupply vessel reloaded in February. You know, we really had to 
hustle. Also managing the wood waste. We had a tub grinder. That was an interesting process, because we 
would grind the wood waste and then ship it back, we’d load it into containers and ship it back to the 
United States. And that was always kind of a monumental task. 
 
9:50 
Nickerson:  So how did you get from managing waste in Antarctica to managing waste in Lyndon, 
Vermont? 
 
Tomasi:  Well, again, it was through a college connection, a friend of mine who lived in this area told me 
about the job opening. And when you fly, when you’re in the Antarctic program, you fly from California 
to New Zealand and then get on a military transport from there. And so the trip from California to New 
Zealand builds up a lot of frequent flier miles. So when this job opened up, I said hey, I’ll fly myself out 
there for the interview, because I had a free ticket. And I had attended Lyndon State College, which is 
here in Lyndonville. So I was familiar with the area. And came in for the interview and was hired about a 
month later. 
 
Nickerson:  So are we technically in Lyndonville? 
 
Tomasi:  Yeah. Lyndonville is the village within the town of Lyndon, yeah. 
 
Nickerson:  Got it. Thank you. And so was that, was your first job here the executive director position? 
 
Tomasi:  When I was hired here, I was hired as the executive director, yeah.  
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. Yeah. So do you remember your first day of work here? 
 
Tomasi:  Yes. And the reason I remember is because it was my 33rd birthday. I was previously living in 
Denver, Colorado. And I had driven across country. My official start date was April first, which was the 
following Monday. But I arrived, I guess, fairly early on March 28th. And I think the timing adds up there. 
Maybe not. But I remember arriving here and introducing myself. The previous director had already left. 
And looking at the computer and recognizing there was nothing on the computer. (laughs) So I basically 
had to start from scratch. 
 
 
One of the things that I noticed right away, we used to have a thermal fax machine. So when 
you’d open up a folder, these thermal faxes, because they came on a roll, would curl up. So one of my 
first projects was to go through folders and make copies so that every time I opened a folder they didn’t 
4 
 
roll up. Which seems counterintuitive in a waste management program, but that drove me crazy. So we 
got rid of the fax machine. And, yeah, that’s how things started here. 
 
13:10 
 
Nickerson:  So if there was no, you know, computer records, and there was nobody there to transition you 
into the job, how did you learn what to do? 
 
Tomasi:  Well our first, not our first, but the person who was in the program position, program manager 
position, had been here for a little while, not that long. And I relied on him and the administrative 
assistant to kind of give me an idea of what happened in the past, and you know, some of the things we 
needed to do. And so, yeah, it was kind of a baptism by fire. 
  
Nickerson:  Yeah. Yeah. So you were really kind of just figuring things out as you went. 
 
Tomasi:  Yeah. Yeah. One of the things that helped me quite a bit was we had a folder of newspaper 
articles. So that was helpful. Kind of gave me an idea of how the waste district was viewed in the public 
eye. Which quite honestly, wasn’t very favorable. And that was in the early days of the waste district. 
And I think they struggled to try and find their feet. And I think I arrived at a good time. Things were 
going pretty well and I was able to kind of keep that momentum going and add to our membership. 
Twenty years later, I’m still here. 
 
14:33 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. Yeah. So could you describe for me what the Northeast Kingdom Waste Management 
District is and does? 
 
Tomasi:  Sure. You know, it’s always been my position that we would not be an organization that would 
dictate how things needed to be done. That we would work with our member communities to help 
whatever system they had in place work the most efficiently.  So that said, it’s interesting, because we 
have towns that have transfer stations. We have towns that have recycling-only facilities. And then we 
have towns that just have private haulers operating, you know, picking up recycling and trash within their 
boundaries. So we try and give our members a great amount of flexibility. But also, when we identify 
inefficiencies, trying to work with them to try and improve their systems. So we don’t have an overall 
program where we plug the towns in and say, you know, you have to do X, Y and Z. The state regulations 
kind of drive what towns need to be doing, but there’s some flexibility there. But you know, we are kind 
of, I view us as kind of consultants that will help our membership.  
 
And so, that said, we don’t usually get involved in trash disposal. We handle the things that the 
private sector typically hasn’t done—hazardous waste, tires, up until recently, recycling. And so we do 
collect, process and market our own recycling. Most years, that’s been a blessing. But some years, not so 
much because of market conditions. But I’d say on average, I think, we’re in a pretty good position 
because we do market our own materials. And we do require that people separate their recyclables into 
specific categories.  
 
We do, also, permitting for facilities, outreach. We cover the largest geographic area of any waste 
district in the state. We have 49 member towns in five counties. Our population, however, is pretty sparse, 
so although we cover probably twice as many towns as most districts, our population is still under fifty 
thousand. So you can do the math. Our average town size is just a little over a thousand. And we actually 
have some towns where there are no permanent residents. 
 
5 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah, yeah. (laughs) Do they generate a lot of waste? 
 
Tomasi:  (laughs) No. No. No.  
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. When I was preparing to come here and I looked at your district on the map, I was 
amazed. I mean, it goes from Jay up north to Corinth in the south— 
 
Tomasi: Yeah. 
  
Nickerson:  --and Guildhall in the east. I mean, those are really different areas. 
 
Tomasi:  Yeah. 
 
Nickerson:  That’s a lot of territory to cover, and towns with very different cultures and identities to deal 
with. 
 
Tomasi:  Yeah.  
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. Yeah. 
 
Tomasi:  The term or phrase “fiercely independent” has been used to describe many of our members. And 
I think it fits. Some are fiercer than others, I suppose.  
 
18:50 
 
Nickerson:  (laughs) So what else, would you say, makes the Northeast Kingdom Waste Management 
District different from some of the other waste management districts in the state? 
 
Tomasi:  Well I think our processing capabilities, the fact that we pick up recycling, those things kind of 
distinguish us from other waste districts. And we really focus on trying to do as much as we can. Because 
we control our own marketing and brokering of material, we can add and subtract things I think more 
easily than some other districts. Agricultural film is a good example of that. Because we have a baler, we 
can bale agricultural film and send that to market. Whereas if you are relying on a single-stream 
processing facility, you can only ship what they accept. So you know, I think we have a little more 
flexibility than some other districts in determining what’s collected and where it goes. 
 
Nickerson:  So just thinking for people who aren’t familiar with waste management, so you said that your 
district picks up recycling? 
 
Tomasi:  Yes. 
 
Nickerson:  So how does that work? And how that would be different from what other districts might be 
doing? 
 
Tomasi:  Right. Well our district, as I said, is comprised of 49 towns. And within those 49 towns, there 
are 30 facilities. And I use the term “facility” loosely, because some of them involve or are just simply a 
shipping container or two in a town garage parking lot or whatever. But our role is to service those 
facilities. So we don’t pick up curbside recycling; we service those drop off centers. So every week we 
probably have out of the 30 facilities, 20 of them require being picked up. So we have three box trucks 
that we go out and pick up the materials, bring the materials back here, supply those facilities with empty 
containers to collect and just keep continually doing that week in and week out. 
6 
 
 
Nickerson:  And other districts might not be doing that. 
 
Tomasi:  Correct. Yeah. Yeah, in fact, I’m not sure that there are other districts that are as involved in the 
collection of recycling as we are. 
 
21:35 
 
Nickerson:  So tell me about how, you mentioned that you do processing here, and you also control your 
sort of sales and marketing. So if you could explain that a little bit. 
 
Tomasi:  Sure. Well the processing involves mainly baling materials, consolidating materials for 
shipment, because everything needs to be in a tractor trailer. You can’t really ship things in a smaller 
quantity. So because we have so many small towns, it makes sense for us to band together, have one 
central point that we can collect and process materials. And then, we work with brokers. It’s essentially 
brokers will arrange for transportation and find us end markets for our materials. So there’s not a lot of 
effort that goes into that once you find a couple of brokers that you can comfortably work with. You make 
some phone calls, send a few emails, and they take care of the rest. 
 
Nickerson:  So how does that differ from what they might be doing at Chittenden or central Vermont or 
Rutland? 
 
Tomasi:  Well, in the case of central Vermont, their materials get shipped out of their district to either 
Rutland or Williston. So those facilities make the decisions about where the material goes. And in the 
case of Rutland and Chittenden, those facilities are operated by private companies. So the private 
companies have a little more say of what goes where and what’s collected. 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. So are you the only district then that’s actually processing recyclables? 
 
Tomasi:  No. I believe the Northwest Solid Waste District also does some of that. I think they also do 
some single stream as well. But they are, I know they have a baler and they are processing and marketing 
some of their own material.  
 
Nickerson:  So what are the recyclables that you are processing or marketing here? Just in broad 
categories. 
 
Tomasi:  Sure. Yeah, I mean, we process and market the six items that are banned from landfill disposal 
in Vermont. So glass, tin, aluminum, plastic, cardboard and mixed paper. And then, in addition to that, 
tires, scrap metal, agricultural film, batteries, hardcovered books, things like that. 
 
24:40 
 
Nickerson:  So would you walk me through what you would do on a typical day, if there is a typical day? 
 
Tomasi:  Yeah. I guess, a typical day, it’s difficult to say. Because one of the interesting things about this 
particular position is, because we’re such a small organization, I can be in the office, you know, at my 
computer. I could be out back pouring off flammable liquids as part of our hazardous waste program, 
which I will be doing later on today. I could be on the truck, picking up recyclables. I could be in the 
warehouse, baling materials. That doesn’t happen very often, but I have done everything that gets done in 
this organization. So if an employee says, “Oh, I can’t do that,” or whatever, I say, “Look, I’ve done it. I 
know how it needs to be done. Whatever.” 
7 
 
But most of my time is spent in the office. I spend a fair amount of time at select board meetings, 
meeting with the various select boards of our member towns. I half-jokingly tell my wife that I should 
write a book called Dogs and Sand, because I sit through so many meetings where the topic of 
conversation is, “Did we get our sand up for the winter? And what about so and so’s dog? It’s running 
loose.” But those are interesting. If you’re ever bored, go to a select board meeting in a small town.  
Because they can be very interesting.  
 
Nickerson:  Just to go back a little bit, when I was looking for suggestions for people to interview, your 
name came up in part because you are a district manager who is just as likely to be found on a forklift as 
behind the desk. 
 
Tomasi:  Yeah. 
 
26:51 
 
Nickerson:  People were talking about that. So can you describe the facility itself to me? 
 
Tomasi:  Oh, sure. Yeah. We actually have a wonderful old facility. It was built as part of the railroad 
infrastructure in the middle of the nineteenth century. It’s constructed of brick and granite. And it was the 
paint shop for the railroad back in the 1860s. over the last 150 years, it’s been used for several different 
things. But we made it our home prior to my arrival, but I think 1994 or ’96 was the year we moved in. So 
unfortunately it’s unheated. So that makes things a little trickier. Even in Antarctica, we had heat in our 
building. But it’s a very, I think, unique and impressive structure. We’re trying to make sure that it stands 
for another 150 years. 
 
28:03 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. And how many people work for you? 
 
Tomasi:  We have ten fulltime employees and two or three part time, depending on the time of year.  
 
Nickerson:  And what kind of jobs do they do? 
 
Tomasi:  We have an administrative assistant who handles accounts payable and receivable and budgeting 
issues. We have a program, actually we split the program position into two. So now we have an 
operations manager who kind of oversees the pick up of materials. And then we have an outreach 
coordinator. And then we have folks on trucks picking up materials. And folks that work in the 
warehouse. And generally speaking, except for the office folks, although the operations manager and 
myself end up rotating through, so that everybody knows [how to do all the positions], sometimes 
someone calls out [sick]. And you may have to work Saturday for walk-in recycling.  
 
 
So most of the positions are interchangeable. You have to know what the other folks do because 
it’s such a small crew. 
 
29:30 
 
Nickerson:  So if I were to be in the facility on a day when you were processing materials, what might I 
see or hear or smell? (laughter)  
 
Tomasi:  Well, yeah, the smell could be interesting. For the most part, materials come in pretty clean. The 
exception to that would be food scraps. Once in a while you open a container and you get a big whiff of 
8 
 
spoiled food. And if someone doesn’t rinse out a cat food container, tuna fish can, you get those types of 
odor. Plastic containers that aren’t rinsed, you get different odors there. 
 
 
You might be able to hear in the background our baler working now. It’s generally on the entire 
eight-hour shift. Sometimes in the summertime we add folks in the evening to catch up with the volume 
of material. So there’s a fair amount of activity of trucks coming and going constantly. Occasionally we’ll 
have a tractor trailer two or three times a week with outgoing material. We’re open for public walk-in on 
Wednesdays and Saturdays. But because we’re here other days of the week, we generally leave the 
warehouse doors open, so that people can come in. And we have the public separated from the processing 
activity. So they can come in and recycle on a Tuesday or a Thursday if they want to, and not interfere 
with the rest of the operation. 
 
Nickerson:  You said that, oh, and I guess there might be lots of trucks coming and going as you’re 
shipping materials to the brokers? 
 
Tomasi:  Generally speaking, that happens a couple of times a week. Outgoing truck loads. And then our 
incoming materials generally just are box trucks that come and go. And those are, we have three. Most 
days, two of them will be on the road. And then in the summertime, the third truck will be on the road 
because there are more people in the area during the snow-free months. 
 
31:58 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. Yeah. And you made reference to burning something off? That you were going to be 
doing later today? 
 
Tomasi:  No, pouring off.  
 
Nickerson:  Oh, pouring off. 
 
Tomasi:  No, we don’t engage in any burning here at the Northeast Kingdom Waste District. (laughter) It 
is illegal in the state of Vermont to burn your waste. So, no. No burning. 
 
Nickerson:  Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. 
 
Tomasi:  But to go back to that, we’re one of the few waste districts that collects household hazardous 
waste. We’re not a year-round facility, but we’re open from May through, usually mid-October.  
 
Nickerson:  For hazardous waste. 
 
Tomasi:  For hazardous waste, yeah. So that’s another thing I’m usually pretty involved in, consolidating 
the hazardous waste and getting that ready for shipment. And then participating, people can make 
appointments and bring their hazardous waste here. But we also have eight to ten events where we’ll drive 
out to the hinterlands and set up a truck for three or four hours and collect on a Saturday. And generally 
I’m involved in about half of those annually. 
  
Nickerson:  Yeah. What are the things that you see at the hazardous, what kinds of hazardous wastes are 
people bringing to you? 
 
Tomasi:  It’s usually paint. We get a lot of paint. But over the years, we’ve received some pretty 
interesting things. There are, and obviously this is just [unclear] recording, but we get some [items], look 
like little red hand grenades. They were used years ago to extinguish flue fires. And they’ve been banned 
9 
 
because they’re an oxygen depletor. And you know, part of that process is it sucks all the oxygen out of 
the room. So if you’re not careful, you’ll put your fire out, but you’ll also asphyxiate yourself.  So I don't 
know how many of those we’ve received over the years, but I’d probably say—one year we received a 
case of six of them. And they’re glass. So they’re very fragile. Occasionally we’ll receive one or two 
individual ones. So those are probably the most unique things. 
 
 
We did receive some, I don’t even know what it was, I think it was a muscle tightener for a horse, 
which contained ether. It was an eight-ounce bottle. But because it had ether as one of the contents, we 
had to call in a company to explode the container on-site. That probably happened four or five years ago. 
 
 
But for the most part, it’s paint and household chemicals. We do get some very old pesticides. We 
get DDT occasionally. We get Malathion, Diazinon, things that have been banned from production for, in 
the case of DDT, probably 35 to 40 years now. But it’s interesting. When I cleaned my grandmother’s 
house out, when she passed away, she had a DDT container that had the family on the front of it playing 
in the yard. And it was a dust for rosebushes. You know, with the dog and kids, you know.  
 
 
We did receive, this is probably going back ten years, when the town of Canaan, Vermont, joined 
the waste district, and we had a hazardous waste event there. And we received paint in cans that had 
horse-drawn carriages on the cover. It said, “The best for your wagon.” And I think those cans were dated 
1890. They were quart containers, but they must have weighed 20 pounds because they were just chock-
full of lead. So luckily someone thought to hold onto those. Who knows how many generations they were 
passed down through? And eventually got turned in at a hazardous waste event. 
 
Nickerson:  Wow. Is it a challenge to figure out what to do with items like that?  
 
Tomasi:  No. We work with contractors that, generally they’ve seen it all, so they’re prepared for those 
things. 
 
36:41 
 
Nickerson:  This brings up the issue of the dangers of working in waste management. Could you talk 
about what are the kinds of aspects of your job that are dangerous, or involve personal risk? 
  
Tomasi:  Well, certainly the hazardous waste program presents some I think more obvious dangers than 
some of the other activities. One year we had a drum that we collected from a site. An endothermic 
reaction was created while it was on the truck and agitated. And it sucked the sides of the drum in, and the 
sides of the drum were ice-cold when we got back to our facility. So that was kind of a scary moment. 
 
 
We also had, when we used to contract out the service, we were in Granby, Vermont. And I think 
this goes back to 1999. Before you pour a flammable liquid into a 55-gallon drum, you always keep 
what’s called a splash bucket to the side so that if you’re unsure of what something is, you can take the 
pH, and if it’s neutral, you can pour it off. But you always want to make sure these chemicals are 
compatible. So you have this splash bucket. You dump a little bit of everything that you’re pouring off 
into that bucket. And at this particular event, a small purple cloud formed. And we all took three or four 
steps back, watched the cloud rise and kind of dissipate in the air. But I see the individuals from that 
company periodically, because they’re still in the business, and we always mention the purple cloud. So 
who knows what exactly we formed that day? I’m not sure. But luckily, it dissipated pretty quickly. 
 
 
And then as far as other hazards go, we’ve had folks who have been stuck by needles. For 
whatever reason, people think that they can recycle their hypodermic needles. And so because we’re 
10 
 
processing our own materials, we’re sorting things and pulling things out as they go out the conveyor. 
And one individual was stuck by a needle. Luckily he went to the hospital and he was fine. 
 
 
And then generally, you know, some back issues occasionally. Slips on ice, things like that. But 
for the most part, I think we’ve been pretty lucky. 
 
 
We did have one person a couple of years ago who had a two-ton concrete block fall on his leg. 
Oddly enough, he was back at work within six months. Didn’t break a bone. He fractured his leg. But it 
didn’t even rip his jeans. And, yeah, that was quite a scare for us and him, obviously. 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. Yeah. When I was preparing for doing this, I read that jobs in waste management are 
like one of the third most dangerous jobs, next to firefighters and policemen. 
 
Tomasi:  Yeah. 
 
Nickerson:  And I think the general public doesn’t realize. 
 
Tomasi:  Yeah. And you know, if the general public would just consider that when they’re putting 
pressurized aerosol cans or propane tanks in their trash instead of the recycling and managing them 
properly, we could cut down on a lot of that. Because it’s not that waste management employees are 
careless. It’s that the things that they’re dealing with oftentimes shouldn’t be there. We’ve had 
ammunition put in our scrap metal. Shotgun shells going up our conveyor belt. So, you know, just hope 
that people use a little more common sense and think about what they’re doing when they’re depositing 
these items. 
 
41:22 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. What are some of the hardest categories, or what is the hardest category of material for 
you to deal with? 
 
Tomasi:  I would have to say plastic. The state of Vermont banned plastic a couple of years ago. They 
were very specific. And when I say “they,” the state, as to what types of plastic were banned from landfill 
disposal. But the general public hears “plastic,” sees plastic, and assumes all plastics are banned from 
landfill disposal. And it’s a very small subset, unfortunately. But those two that were banned, number one 
and number two plastics, represent about 85 percent of your typical food and beverage containers. That 
doesn't mean that it’s 85 percent of all plastic, which I think gets confusing sometimes for folks. But you 
know, people want to recycle their kiddie pools or their plastic slides that they bought for their kids but 
got hit by a snow plow, or a whole host of plastic items. Coffee makers. And they’re just not accepted. 
And people sometimes get indignant because we don’t accept certain things. And my response is you 
need to think about that when you buy it, not when you’re ready to get rid of it. So, we struggle with that. 
For the most part, everything else is fairly straightforward. 
 
43:02 
 
Nickerson:  I know that you have lots of different programs here. What’s the program that you’re the 
most proud of? 
 
Tomasi:  You know, I’d have to say our bicycle program. We had an employee back in the early 2000s 
who had an interest in repairing bicycles and giving them away. And we’ve been doing that now for about 
15 years. and it’s a pretty popular program. We’re just now transitioning that program to a nonprofit. So 
11 
 
we’re still storing the bicycles. But somebody else will be repairing them and kind of overseeing that 
program.  
 
 
But the interesting thing about the bike program is as part of our repair process, we put a sticker 
on the bike. It has the year and then our NEKWMD logo. And so it’s like a catch and release program. 
And we have some bikes that have ’06, ’08 stickers on them. So it’s really interesting to see those come 
back and get reused multiple times.  
 
44:20 
 
Nickerson:  That’s really neat. What is your favorite part of the job, or the best part of the job for you? 
 
Tomasi:  I guess my favorite part of the job is when I can work with a town and help them either add 
some sort of program or save them money some way. And you know, a lot of times that will happen as 
we add more towns. We haven’t added many towns recently. But when we first got here, I think we had 
34 member towns. And now we have 49. So you know, meeting with some of these new towns and 
helping them realize that they could be doing things differently or saving money, I think, is the most 
satisfying part of the job. 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. And how about your least favorite or the most challenging part of the job? 
 
Tomasi:  I think it’s related to the best part of the job, is trying to help a town who doesn’t necessarily 
recognize an opportunity for increased efficiency or money savings. It doesn’t happen that often, but 
sometimes it does, and that can be frustrating. And sometimes working with the regulatory agency. The 
people are great, but sometimes the policies can be a little difficult to navigate. 
 
46:07 
 
Nickerson:  Has what’s going on in China affected the Northeast Kingdom Waste Management District? 
 
Tomasi:  It has, but not to the degree that it’s affected some other facilities and districts that rely on 
single-stream. And I’ll give you a perfect example. We get 45 dollars a ton for our mixed paper. And 
some other facilities that are processing single-stream mixed paper are paying 57 dollars a ton. So that’s a 
big difference. That’s—kind of lost my train of thought here. (laughs) 
 
Nickerson:  I was asking if what was going on with China had affected you. 
 
Tomasi:  Oh, right, right. So we’ve been somewhat insulated from that, because we process our own 
material, and it’s a lot cleaner. Most of what is the issue with China is that we’ve been shipping—and I 
say “we” as a country—dirty material for years. And it amazes me how surprised people are that this all 
of a sudden happened over the last year. But tin 2008, China said, “You better clean your stuff up or 
we’re not going to take it anymore.” Ten years went by. Nothing happened. And now all of a sudden 
we’re surprised that they made this decision. I’m surprised it didn’t happen sooner. 
 
Nickerson:  So are the residents in your member towns, are they separating out their recyclables by type? 
 
Tomasi:  They are. Yeah. 
 
Nickerson:  So you don’t do single-stream. 
 
12 
 
Tomasi:  Correct. Correct. Yeah. That’s been a big advantage for us. Some would argue that it keeps our 
diversion rate lower. But I would argue that we have one of the best diversion rates in the state, if not the 
country. 
 
Nickerson:  I’m looking at the time. Are you okay with three or four more questions? 
 
Tomasi:  Oh, yeah. Sure. 
 
48:20  
 
Nickerson:  Okay. Great. So you’ve been in this field for a while. How do you feel like, has it changed? 
 
Tomasi:  Oh, it absolutely has changed. Especially on the state level. The state of Vermont passed Act 
148 several years ago. And that changed a lot of how we handled things, and the public’s perception. For 
the most part, we’ve been compliant, and were compliant even prior to Act 148. But there are some things 
that we’ll struggle with going forward. The diversion of organics. We have organics collections points at 
all of our facilities that are required to have them. What we don’t have is enough infrastructure to expand 
organics diversion. And without that infrastructure, it’s going to be a challenge for us, and it’s going to be 
a challenge for the state of Vermont. 
 
Nickerson:  When you say organics, you mean food scraps. 
 
Tomasi:  Food scraps, yeah. Primarily food scraps. We are making progress, though. We have a couple of 
processors locally and we’re working with individuals to try and give them the information they need to 
navigate the permitting process and get some other folks started. So I’m encouraged by recent events. 
You know, if we had this interview a couple of months ago, I might not have been as encouraged. But 
things are looking up. 
 
Nickerson:  So the flip side of that question is, 30 years from now, do you think someone in your 
community will be doing your job? 
 
Tomasi:  Oh, yeah. I mean, I fully expect that the waste district will still be relevant 30 years from now. I 
think things, I hope things will look a little different. That we’ll be managing resources and less reliant 
upon landfill disposal. But we’ll see how that goes. 
 
50:46 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. Yeah. And what advice would you give, if I were a young person just getting out of 
college and wanted to go into your job, what advice would you give that person? 
 
Tomasi:  Be patient. I graduated from Lyndon State College in 1988. I did go on to get my master’s 
degree. But it took me eleven years to get to this position. And I think there’s a desire by a lot of younger 
folks to go to college and get their dream job immediately. And I just don’t think that’s realistic. So, you 
know, you put in some time and try different things. I don't think when I graduated from college if you 
would have asked me where do I see myself in ten years, it wouldn’t be in this position. But things 
worked out, and I don't think I’d trade it. 
 
Nickerson:  Any special skills or knowledge that is required by your position? 
 
Tomasi:  It’s hard to say. I feel like—my college professors would hate me if they hear this—to say that 
I’m not sure that college prepared me for this. But there are times when I say oh, yeah, something in 
13 
 
ecology or a science class clicked. But I think just being flexible and willing to communicate and able to 
communicate, whether it’s orally or written, is pretty important in this type of position. And willingness 
to talk, whether it’s in person or on the phone. And I know a lot of folks today are tuned into their phones 
and their emails, but there’s still no substitute for one-on-one engagement. 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. Yeah. So is there anything that we have not covered that you would like people to 
know about the job that you do? 
 
53:27 
 
Tomasi:  Yeah. There’s a lot that goes on after you put your materials out. So when you place something 
out at the curb or you bring it to a facility, keep in mind that that’s just the beginning of the process. 
Sometimes it will be handled by an individual, sometimes multiple individuals. And just be aware of, 
there are health risks to putting things in the improper place. And we would appreciate your help, if you 
read the signs. (laughter)  
 
Nickerson:  That’s great. Well, Paul, I know you have some other things to do today. So thank you so 
much. I really appreciate your time and sharing your stories with us.  
 
Tomasi:  You’re welcome.
