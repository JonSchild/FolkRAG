Of a 
pretty Irish girl, her teeth as bright as pearls, 
And such rosy cheeks, I 
never saw before; 
Her eyes they are so bright, they shine like stars 
at night. 
Sure she is the only girl that I 
adore. 
She is like the birds of May, singing all the day, 
And her like I'm sure that you have never seen; 
Mary Ellen, that's her name, she lives down in the lane. 
And I 
call her my pretty Irish Queen. 
CHORUS. 
My pretty, my pretty, my pretty Irish Queen,

in the lane. 
And I 
call her my pretty Irish Queen. 
You should see my pretty pearl, as she's skipping 
to the well. 
With her little water pail upon her arm, 
With her lovely flowing hair, arrah, with her 
none can compare. 
And all the Irish hearts she does charm. 
Next Sunday night at eight, down by the garden gsAe, 
I'll present her with a 
wedding ring; 
And happy'll be the day, when to the church 
we will sway, 
And I'll marry my pretty Irish Queen.

THE PATTER OF THE SHINGLE. 
RECITED BY JOB UART. 
When the angry passion gathering 
In my mother's face I 
see; 
And she leads me to the bed-chamber, 
Gently lays me on her knee. 
Then I 
know that I 
will catch it, 
And my flesh in fancy itches, 
As I 
listen to the patter 
Of the shingle on my breeches. 
Every tinkle of the shingle, 
Has an echo and a 
sting, 
And a 
thousand burning fancies 
Into active being spring. 
And a 
thousand bees and hornets, 
Beneath my coat-tail seem to RW9.1413, 
And 1 
feel the patter 
Of the shingle, oh! so warm. 
In a 
sudden intermision, 
Which appears my only chow" 
I 
say strike gently, mother, 
Or you'll split my Sunday Foals: 
She stops a 
moment, draws her breath. 
The shingle holds aloft, 
And says, I 
had not thought of that, 
My son just take them breeches (AZ 
Holy Moses and the angels, 
Cast your pittying glances down, 
Ana you, good family doctor, 
Put a 
good soft poultice on. 
And may I 
with fools and duncea 
Everlastingly mingle, 
If I 
ever say another word, 
When my mother wields the shingle.

It was just behind the woodshed, 
One glorious summer do,y; 
Far o'er the hills the sinking SIIH, 
Pursued its western way. 
And in my lone seclusion, 
Safely removed afar 
From all earth's confusion, 
I 
smoked my first cigar. 
Ah I 
bright the boyish fancies, 
Wrapped in the wreaths of blue, 
My eyes grew dim my head was ligkk. 
The woodshed round me flew,

Grim death I 
thought I 
had found.

MY DARLING, BUT TALKATIVE WIFE, 
WORDS BY C. W. MARE. 
MUSIC BY J. SCHWENSECK. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, BY WM. J. A. LIEBER. 
ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 
Some people they grumble the day in and out. 
Over very small trifles of life. 
But I 
think I've the right to tell you about 
My darling, but talkative wife 
A 
day cannot pass but I 
get a 
new name, 
You numbskull, you fool, dunce, and such, 
For me to talk thus you might say 'tis a 
shame, 
but really, my wife talks too much. 
CHORUS. 
Now John, come and kiss me, oh! do have a 
care, 
One'd think you were kissing a 
mule; 
Why John, youv'e been drinking to- day, I 
declare! 
You're leading the life of a 
fool, 
Before we were married, you promised you know. 
We'd lead a 
most happy gay life; 
But since we are married I 
find 'tisn't so, 
I'm only your talkative wife. 
One evening while kissing she said have a 
care, 
One'd think you were kissing a 
male, 
I 
said as a 
joke, I 
just kissed one, my dear, 
I 
know not that I 
was a 
fool. 
She scratched me, she pinched me, she wept and she said 
You're mean, you're a 
brute, so you are, 
And she cried as she tore some nice locks from my head, 
I'm going right back to my ma. 
Chorus. 
Now here at election I 
bet a 
new hat, 
Of course 'twas a 
very small cost, 
But she keeps saying why did you do that? 
Why bet on the men that have lost. 
There's Jenkins next door, whose as cute as a 
horse, 
Has several new suits while you've none; 
Now when did he get them, he won them of cour se,
Choru  s, 
By betting on those that have won. 
I 
thought I'd find peace in the club room at night, 
I 
went there one evening to test, 
Oh! then I 
found peace, yes, and then I 
got tight, 
And came home, I 
shant tell the rest. 
One thing I 
will say, though, to all you young men, 
When married, oh! guard against strife; 
If you don't you will wish you were single again, 
Chau& 
That's if you've a 
talkative wife.

I've a 
little treasure here, 
One to which I 
fondly cling; 
'Tis a 
gift from Willie dear, 
'Tis my my angel brother's ring. 
Lying on his dying cot, 
He called me unto his side; 
Take this ring, forget me nct ! 
Whispered Willie, then he died, 
Cnoaus. 
On my finger here I wear, 
What to me's a 
precious thing,_ 
'Tis the gift of Willie dear, 
It's my brother Willie's ring. 
Lying sick upon his bed, 
While grim death stood in the door: 
Willie looked at me and said, 
Sister, sing to me once more? 
Sing that song of angel's love, 
For ere long I 
shall be one, 
And when I'm in heaven above, 
I 
will watch and guide thee on. 
Chorus.. 
In the cold, cold church-yard tomb, 
Lies our little Willie love, 
While his soul has floated home 
To that golden land above. 
Oft while lying on my bed, 
Tears unto my eyes will spring. 
Thinking o'er what Willie said, 
When he gave to me this ring. 
Chorus. 
IT DON'T 
DON'T BELONG TO ME, 
When I 
was but a little child I 
used to go to school, 
And there I 
was so very good, they thought I 
was a 
fool; 
Because I 
never claimed a 
thing that didn't belong to me. 
For I was just as honest and as truthful as could be. 
While walking Gut the other day by a 
police man 
I 
was stopped, 
Be says young man this piece of gold just from 
your pocket dropped; 
But as I 
never carried one, and had but little coin, 
Like an honest boy I did reply the purse it is not mine. 
CHORUS. 
No it don't belong to me, it don't belong to me, 
You had better inquire of somebody higher, 
it don't belong to me, 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you see, 
I 
know nothing whatever about the purse, 
it don't belong to me. 
My wages being very small I 
live in humble style, 
But with the girls I 
lardy dah, among the great and fine 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I 
have plenty cheek, 
But little they think I 
do the swell upon five 
dollars a 
week. 
The other day I 
bought a 
pie, I 
placed it in my hat, 
I 
saw a 
lady on the street, I 
knew she'd stop to chat, 
My hat blew off, the pie fell out, the little boys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said it don't 
belong to me. 
Chorus. 
I 
occupy an attic room in a 
street away up town, 
And in the next there lives a 
girl her name is 
Nelly Brown, 
Whenever I get a chance to talk or pass the time away. 
I 
have a 
little gossiping in a 
quiet sort of way. 
As I 
came home the other night oh ! what a 
dreadful scene, 
The landlord rushing after me saying, Bill, 
what does tis mean, 
Miss Brown has left behind this infant as you see, 
says I, you quite surprise me, sir, but it don't 
belong to 1114.

I 
have a 
daughter of great renown, 
In the ballet she dances in a 
theatre up town; 
She's a 
darling to me, and so pretty you see, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
She wears tarletan skirts all covered with tin, 
She's as an angel a 
soul without sin; 
She's a 
dancer, you see, in the tra-la-la-lee, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
CHORUS. 
She waltzes and pivots so neat on her toes, (Sym.) 
As 'round and 'round and 'round she goes; ( sym.) 
Now there's one thing sure I 
can't understand, 
Why her name on the bills should read 
Madam Du Rand, 
She high-tened wants to be, but she's Irish you see; 
And her right name is Biddy McGee. 
I 
taught her the skip, the hop, and the dip, 
To the tune of a 
fiddle around she would trip, 
She's of high degree, and takes after me, 
Doe's this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
She's a 
voice like a 
bell, though I 
never could tell, 
Where she got it, or how, 'tis a 
mystery as well; 
For she's so full of glee, when dancing you see, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee.

There are songs unsung in every heart, 
Some beautiful memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear-drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope, that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded and withered and dead, 
Oh! beautiful songs unsung. 
CHORUS. 
Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung, 
Oh ! nestle alone in thy secret place, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
There are songs unsung, there are tales untold, 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and to cherish, 
Tho' some are sombre, and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the sad lened they're clung, 
They are set in tears, and never ean die, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
Chorus. 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love, 
That in kindness and truth were spoken, 
But now are the links of a 
glad wild dream, 
Cherished and loved yet broken. 
And, oh ! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that WM kiss'd bydeath. 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung.

In a

Far across the sea on dear old Erin's shore, 
In a 
cottage lives my love where the birds

sing sweet above, 
And the shamrocks grow in plenty round the door, 
'Tis her pretty face is bright as the stars that 
shine at night, 
And her pleasant smile the sweetest ever seen; 
She's as happy as the lark from daylight until dark, 
! 
I 
fondly love my own, my dear colleen. 
CHORUS. 
She will gladly welcome me when her pretty face I 
see, 
For when I 
land on Erin's shore so green, 
Then the happiest hour to me in all my life will be, 
When I'm wedded to my own, my dear colleen. 
She has eyes of perfect blue, she has cheeks 
of rosy hue, 
And a 
wealth of pleasant sunbeams in her smile; 
She has such a 
roguish face and her every 
move is grace, 
While her voice is like the song of birds the while. 
In a 
little rustic cot she shall share my happy lot, 
And the birds o'er head shall sing their joyous lay, 
And the flowers shall bloom so sweet then 
with earthly joys complete, 
We shall pass our lives in sunshine bright and gap.

And my heart first learned its semi.,

She said you would meet me, but I've waited long in vain-. 
In lands far away she does roam ; 
Her promise she will keep— oh 
break it not my Jean ! 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh I 
then let me leng not wan, let ine meet thee 
soon, my Jean, ' 
And the Ilesve”s will smile on our love. 
And when life is dead, we will leav3 this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

JANE. 
WRITTEN BY BEN COLLINS FOR TFIE SUEERINS. 
Not many miles from here, 
Where they sell Milwaukee beer, 
Lives a 
maiden who has got me on a 
string, 
'She's the worst you ever saw, 
She has nearly broke my 
jaw, 
And mads me wear my left duke in a 
sling. 
She's a 
female pugilist, 
lowly suffering what a 
fist, 
It will send you where you won't come back again; 
Her nose looks like a 
cork, 
And she's the terror of New York, 
She's my freckled, fat consumptive Sarah Jane. 
CHORUS. 
Jane, Jane, my Kentucky Jane— pants, 
I 
busted Friday evening at the dance; 
Oh! they say you have no sense, 
But I 
still think you insane, 
You're my freckled, fat, cunstunptive Sarah Jane. 
She promised she would meet me, 
When the clock struck seventeen, 
At the stock yards a 
mile outside of town; 
Where the pigs feet and pigs ears, 
And the tough old Tc4xas steers, 
Were sold for sirlion steaks ten cents a 
pound. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She is cross-eyed, she is crazy, 
She's hump-backed, she's bow-legged, and she's lame; 
She's always full of blarney, 
And shz's struck on Dennis Carney, 
She's my freckled, fat, consumptive Sarah Jane, 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Jane, my poor foolish Jane, 
Slug her with your suspenders once again, 
They say your teeth are false, 
From eating Rochelle salts, 
She's my skinny, lanky, Sarah Jane.

BURLESQUE ON AILEEN ALANA. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY 
AS GLIDDEN. 
Aileen Alanna, Aileen asthore, 
Was born in the country, 
Along with Barnum's Show; 
They cut her eye teeth with a 
brick, 
And raised her like a 
calf; 
And she done flip flaps on a 
baulkey horse, 
And made the gillies laugh. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
yes, she was a 
crusher, 
And she used to grease her musc!e, 
She wore a 
patent corset, 
And a 
double breasted bustle. 
She'd throw her eye at all the guys, 
As round the ring she went, 
And she chewed plug tobacco like a 
horse. 
Aileen Alanna, oh ! how that girl could smil 
She had a 
mouth like a 
railroad crossing, 
Teeth like a 
cross cut pile, 
Her favorite dish was cross-eyed fish, 
She said it gave her brain; 
She went to a 
dentist, be pulled her breath, 
And she liked to went insane. 
Chorus. 
I 
wonder where her daddy is, 
If he only found it out, 
Perhaps he swallowed a 
porous plaster, 
Or else he's got the gout. 
Perhaps he's doing a 
song and dance, 
Way up in that back room, 
Oh! daddy, dear daddy come home. 
Chores. 
Aileen Alanna, some one set her drunk, 
Tony Pastor found her, 
And held her under a 
pump; 
Brother Beacher took her home, 
And sent her off to bed, 
And old John Robinson, 
Rubbed blue glass on her head.

There's a happy little cot down in southern Tennessee, 
WheTe the ivy blossoms twine round the door, 
And forever fresh and green in my memory it will be, 
Enough I 
know I'll never see it any more; 
But I 
never can forget the old home I 
lore so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung, 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to tell 
Of the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
CHORUS. 
Vow the tambo and the bones, am forever laicl away, 
The fiddle and the banjo am unstrung; 
But I 
often heave a

And the times I 
used to have when I

When the autumn days had come, I 
would 
husk the yellow corn, 
In the fields I 
was singing all the day, 
&nd before they made me free I 
had never cause 
to mourn; 
And around the old place everything was gay; 
And many and many a 
time when the work of 
day was over, 
With my melody the old plantation rung, 
.1,nd my heart does often long for the happy 
days of yore, 
And the times I

DANCE ME ON Y, 
UR KNEE. 
PARODY. 
SUNG BY J. C. MURPHY. 
When I 
was but a 
little boy, 
My mother says to me, 
Be careful Johnny, where you go, 
When you get in your teens, 
Some young girl may entice you, 
And cause you to leave poor me, 
And the next I'll hear about you, 
You'll be dancing on her knee. 
CHORUS. 
So dance me on your knee, my darling, 
Dance me on your knee; 
Put your head upon my breast, 
It pleases me, you see. 
Squeeze me tight, don't let me fall, 
For I 
am not afraid at all. 
So dance me darling, dance me, 
Dance me on your knee. 
I 
met a 
daisy on the street, 
She slyly winked at me; 
My mother's words came tc my mind, 
Says 1, daisy, let me be. 
She threw a 
kiss across the street, 
She won my heart you see, 
That night she had me sure enough, 
A dancing on her knee. 
Chorus. 
Her mother happened in one night, 
And when she seen me there; 
Her voice cried out like a 
big giraff, 
As she gently raised a 
chair. 
Git, says she, you bet, says I, 
I 
was glad to get scott free, 
You'll never catch me there again, 
A dancing on 11 ,1. knee.

I 
like honest pluck in this warfare of life, 
'1.o matter whoever I 
meet; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear; 
Yet, 'tis better to know you're prepared for the wont. 
Than tremble like children with fear. 
CHORUS. 
I 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels, 
I 
can light with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels. 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne.er knew the man who had none; 
Hard words may be. used, but I 
like him the most, 
-Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wrong I 
can cure the foul slander ot once, 
And destroy every venomous part; 
Yet I 
reel, when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
Chorus, 
So behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
If you can't do him no good, do him no harm; 
If you don't like backbiting, don't do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm 
We all have to live, so let's try and make life 
A 
good open field for the race, 
And if you have cause of complaint ' gainst a 
man, 
Go tell him right straight to his face.

ks we walk thro' the streets how often we meet, 
Some poor old man who's life is naught but woe; 
With age his form is bent, in his pockets not a

And for shelter he linows not where to go. 
With relations by the score who drive him from the does 
And meet hi ptt on the street they pass him by, 
if you ask him why it's done, he will answer 
you and say,. 
I 
am poor and old and only in the way.

So let us cheer them on, they won't be with us long, 
Don't let us sneer because they're old and gray;

When we'll be old and only in the way. 
There was a

hear when the young were

Young men irr health and might, their old 
parents they will strike. 
It happens every day, it's nothing strange. 
When he his bread can't earn, his children do 
him spun 
For death I 
am sure he oftentimes does pray, 
Himself and faithful wife after toiling all their life,; 
When old they find they're only in the way. 
My little gong I'm sure is for rich as well as poor, 
or take a 
rich man when he's growing old, 
His friends will shake his hand, his relations 
round him stan41. 
Awaiting for him to the they want his gold. 
Then let us from this hour, do all that's in our power, 
To make the road for the old folks light and gay, 
And if they trouble on us cast, why let us be the Isifti 
To say when old that they are only in the way.

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
RECIIED BY GUS WILLIAMS. 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and sloe. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout. 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep. 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping band to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery deist 
At last came out of the merry troop. 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
"I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
"She's somebody's mother, boys, you. know, 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand 
To help my mother- : ohm understand I 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
" 
Somebody's mother." bowed low her head. 
In her home that night, and the prayer she staki 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice. and worn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
Angels caught the faltering word, 
And " Somebody'ii mother's" prayer was hew&

ONLY THE WAY ON THE STAGE. 
By Fred J. Mackley. 
Sung by Henry Graham. 
if you will listen to me some facts I 
will mention, 
Concerning the past and the present strange age. 
And in them, my friends, to von I'll relate 
Some things I 
saw one night and played on the stage. 
I 
came to this city with 
ur two friends, 
And went for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
When we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new drama was played on the stage. 
The first scene I 
saw was a 
e 
trect in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging. she quiet old in age, 
Those sad means - he tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson of life's book a 
page ; 
But a 
policeman passed hv, his face seemed in smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
he'd murdered a 
matt by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad, 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed, 
The jury looked stsrn, and the judge iu a 
rage, 
trai they hung that rich man fq. tine murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it will played on the stage. 
In the near scepe I 
saw a 
c'ergvman from Brooklyn. 
Wh o was danei ,ng a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one 1.om Jersey was playing- tine violin, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed. 
For just at that mittute a 
party mimed Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine aernion on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that that they practiced each 
sermon they preaobot 
Bmt it wa-n only the way it wae played on the stage.

THE TRAMP; 
RE ir D BY FRANK LIIM. 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe, 
Don't you commence your cusin,' I 
ain't done 
nothin' to yon 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we 
ain't no good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though 
folks don't think that we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty 
of cash and clothe, 
That was afore I 
tippled, and gin got into my nose, 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew. 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'n—and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was j 
ust sixteen, 
She was the pootiest ereeter the valley had ever seen. 
Beaux? why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from 
near and far. 
But they were mostly farmers, none of 'em suited her, 
There was a 
city stranger, young handsome, and tall, 
Dam him--I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall, 
He was the man for Nellie— she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know 
a 
young gal's will, 
Well it's the same old story—common enough you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away, 
More than a 
month or after, we heard from the 
poor young thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring, 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her 
mothers side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever, she fell at my feet and died, 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother 
began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when 
I 
took to drink, 
Gimme one glas4, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
IT tramp till I

One day in the street, I 
just happened to meet, 
An old friend whom I'd not seen for years, 
The old man was sad tho' to.meet me was glad, 
And his eyes as we spoke filled with tears. 
I 
said, John, be brief, what's the cause of your grief 
To me your misfortunes unfold; 
Said he, in poor me, you a 
sample may see, 
Of how a 
man gets served when he's old. 
CHORUS. 
Each day growing older, I 
get the cold shoulder, 
By youngsters thrust out in the cold, 
Who jeeringly say, that I'm in the way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
When young I 
was praised, and my wages was raised 
No labor then I 
ever did shirk; 
And my master would then point me out to the men, 
As the one who best stuck to his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak. 
Unless it's to grumble or scold; 
They simply make fun of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you'ae old. 
Chorus 
My wife poor soul she is nearly seventy-three. 
How to keep her from want I 
don't know; 
If I 
beg, I 
intrude, and by police are pursued, 
And if to the Commissioners of Charities we go. 
To seek for relief they but add to our grief, 
You must go to the Island we are told, 
Past husband from wife, to be paupers for life, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
Chang,

We're both growing aged together, 
And Jennie has left the old farm ; 
To walk by the side of another, 
As on in life's journey they roam, 
And John who was tender and loving, 
Has gone in the pathwhy to harm; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
In suffer or mortgage the !arm. 
It's sad to be a.;ed and feeble. 
And know that this life has no charms, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
how painful to mortgage the farm. 
We thought dohn would be our protection, 
For he wa•t so kind when a 
boy ; 
And lietsey so gentle aid 
Would call him a mother'', fond joy. 
But be 
as led off by companions, 
In ways that bring evil and harm ; 
nd left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
It's hard to he 1, veless and childle;s, 
When wrinldes are deep on the brow ; 
And hair has grown :wed and whiten/ad, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and helpless, 
kk it hi none to protect us from harmi 
We only can suffer in silence. 
Or tearfully mortgage the farm.

Down by a 
running brook, 
A 
pretty girl I 
chanced to meet, 
I 
never shall forget her look. 
With dark blue eyes and golden • hair, 
And teeth as white as snow, 
Her heart I 
won in the shining sun, 
Where pretty lilacs grow. 
Clionns. 
When the birds are singing in the glittering sunshine, 
There's none so fair as this pretty girl of mine, 
I 
never shall forget where first we met, 
My pretty little beau, 
One summers night when the moon shone bright, 
Where pretty lilacs grow. (Danee.) 
There is a 
happy day to come, 
A 
day I'll never dread, 
When together to the church we go, 
And this pretty little maid I 
wed. 
Where the little birds are singing in the tree, 
We'll ramble to and fro, 
And ne'er forget where first we met, 
Where pretty lilacs grow.

Where the softest breezes rustle, 
Through the fields of nodding rye, 
And the brightest sunbeams glimmer. 
In the azure- tinted sky ; 
Dwells a 
maiden pure and lovely, 
As she gleans the golden grain ; 
One as blooming.fts the roses, 
Bright and w;.  m•ome Whittle Wane.

At the bright dawn of the morning, 
Or when twilight shades the plain, 
You may see our queen of roses, 
Bright and winsome ‘‘ innie Wane. 
Hearts were made for joy and sorrow, 
For life's sunshine and its gloom, 
And sweet Winnie in hey gladness 
Rivals all that's bright in bloom. 
She is kind to those that suffer, 
And they never ask in vain, 
For the words of love and pity, 
From the lips of Winnie Wane. 
Would you know our fondest treasure, 
Who is fairest of the fair, 
Go among the poor and lowly, 
You will ever find her there. 
Touching brightly brows of sorrow, 
Soothing hearts that throb with psis, 
While the sunbeams fall in beauty, 
O'er out winsome Winnie Wane.

I'LL TAKE YOU HOME AGAIN 
KATHLEEN, 
SUNG BY JOHNNY REESE. 
I'll take you home again, Kathleen, 
Across the ocean wild, 
To where your heart has ever been 
Since first you were my bonnie bride. 
The roses all have left your cheek, 
I've watched them fade away and die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bediru your loving eyes. 
CHORUS. 
I'll take you back again, Kathleen, 
To where your heart will feel no pain, 
And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
Totthat brisht home beyond the sea, 
1!IyiKathleen shall again return, 
And when the old friends welcome thee 
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn; 
Where laugh that little silvery stream, 
Beside your mother's humble cot, 
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam, 
Then all your grief will be forgot. 
Chorus. 
THE GOSPEL TRAIN, 
SUNG BY T. C. MURPHY. 
The gospel train am coming, 
I 
hear her close at hand; 
I 
hear dem car wheels rolling, 
And a 
rumbling through de land. 
I 
hear de bell and whistle, 
It's coming round de curve, 
It's straining every muscle, 
And a 
busting every nerve. 
CHORUS. 
Den get on board, little children, 
Get on board, little children, 
Get on board little children, 
Dere's room for many more. 
It's nearing now de station, 
Oh ! sinners don't be vain; 
But come and get your tickets, 
Get ready,' for de train. 
I 
think it will make a 
little halt, 
And stop upon the line, 
And give you all a 
chance to go, 
But she will make her time. 
No signal for another train, 
To follow on this line; 
Oh! sinner's you're for ever lost, 
If you get left behind. 
The fare ain cheap and all can go, 
The rich the poor am there, 
No second class on board this train, 
No difference in the fare.

Chorus_ 
AIR; CASTLES IN TELE AIR. 
SUNG BY J. C. MURPHY., 
While thinking of some past events, 
At home the other night, 
And sitting by my cheerful fire, 
Which then was burning bright, 
At length the fire began to fade, 
The shades then o'er it grew. 
I 
fancied I 
was future seeing, 
Some grand dissolving views. 
Some views there were that gave me joy, 
While others gave me pain, 
And may I 
never see theni in reality again. 
So give me your attention, 
And I'll quickly tell to you, 
Some pictures that I 
witnessed in 
'Those grand dissolving views. 
'The first a 
view of sad distress, 
A 
truly wretched case; 
The family of a 
wo4inginan, 
Want, stares them in the face, 
The mother and her children, 
Huddled round a 
scanty fire, 
Of embers rather threatening, 
Every moment to expire, 
At length the father enters, 
He hangs his honest head, 
-While silently he hands to each, 
Their share of poor house bread. 
Through poverty he has to steal, 
Though doomed to jail he knew, 
A 
sad but truthful picture in 
This grand dissolving view. 
The next scene was a 
police court, 
Two prisoners in were led, 
One was a 
well-dressed swindler, 
The other a 
boy that was ill fed. 
He had stolen food, confessed his guilt, 
For pardon did entreat; 
He said T 
am an orphan boy and nothing have to eat 
t6ix months hard labor was his doom, 
'The tears rolled down his face. 
While he who'd stolen money, 
Got off with his good grace. 
He paid the counsel with the spoil, 
'Twits money pulled him i 
through, 
While justice blind in silence smiled, 
-On this grand dissolving view.

in the early hours of morning, 
O'er the waves we swiftly go, 
Heedless of the sailor's warning, 
Where the foam-capped billows flow; 
For this hour we long have waited, 
And the charms within our reacb 
Make our hearts with joy elated 
Off for Coney Island Beach 
CHORUS. 
Sonic may sail across the ocean, 
Which is far beyond our reach, 
While we find enough commotion,. 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
Many pleasures now surround us, 
On this breezy summer day. 
And with charming friends around no, 
O'er the waves we speed away, 
Till we reach that isle of gladness, 
Which is just within our , each, 
Where we banish all our sadness, 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
In the chilling surf we shiver, 
But o ,r 
hearts are light and free, 
While the wavelets dance and quiver, 
Rolling in from depths of sea. 
And the breeze is softly blowing, 
All our lonely ones , hohld leach, 
That the wise much blies are knowing, 
Down on Con- y 
Island Beach.

With the dawn of the morning from far and from nee; 
The columns are marehing, and soon they appear, 
You see them approaching o'er hill and o'er dale, 
And each one is armed with a 
bright dinner pail. 
They may not seem warlike, thus simply arrayed, 
But they are the heroes of toil, the tin bucket brigade. 
'Neath the lid of the bucket. t,ho' humble it seems, 
Are rarest of dainties invitingly clean; 
Filled up to the brim with provident care, 
That the eater might have both enough and to share. 
Don't think it demeaning nor cloth it degrade, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
Hide not your position and be not afraid, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
To you my fine fellows, with scorn in your eyes, 
With disdain on your lips as you see them pass by, 
Consoling yourselves, you are not like those 
Poor greasy mechanics, in labor soiled clothes. 
Just think of the time when your own father made 
Your wealth, when he marched with the bucket brigada 
And to all those rich fellows who once carried a 
pail, 
And think that -the item's forgotten ard stale; 
Though they are worth thousands and carry no more, 
The old dinner bucket they carried of yore, 
Just think of the time when their own fathers made 
Their wealth when they marched with the 
bucket brigadO.
