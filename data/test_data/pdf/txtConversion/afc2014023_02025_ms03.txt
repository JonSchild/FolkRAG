hand engraving).

Shavarsh K Jewelry Design – “Lost wax” or investment casting area: on the right (and mid-
ground left) boxes of flexible molds in which wax forms may be case. Almost directly in the 
center, a metal cylinder with evidence of plaster – in the casting process, a loose, yoghurt-
thick plaster is poured over the wax form inside this metal tube. Once the plaster sets, the 
metal tube with its hard plaster is put in a kiln and slowly warmed, heat volatizes the wax 
material out, molten metal [Shavarsh works with gold, platinum, & silver] is introduced 
into the void.

Shavarsh K Jewelry Design – “Lost wax” or investment casting area: note metal cylinder 
with evidence of plaster on left. The blue materials attached to the red “stem” is a positive 
of the shape to be “cast” in plaster. In the casting process, plaster is poured over this wax 
form, which will be inside a metal tube. The gentle “cone shape” on top of which the red 
part rests is NOT part of the casting; that forms a funnel-like shape, down which liquid 
metal should flow. Once the plaster sets, the metal tube with its hard plaster is put in a kiln 
and slowly warmed, heat volatizes the wax material out, molten metal [Shavarsh works 
with gold, platinum, & silver] is introduced into the void.

Shavarsh K Jewelry Design – Another jewelry workstation, establishing shot with good 
example of various traditional hand tools and contemporary technology: “dremmel” type 
flex-drive power hand grinder, high-power optical aid, and various micro-tools in tool-slot 
blocks.

Shavarsh K Jewelry Design – Shavarsh discussed and displays a perfect example of 
terminal development jewelry design: a confluence of discerning, aware clients, mature 
experience and master craftsmanship level of expertise, facility with collateral specialist 
support and suppliers, ongoing technical skill acquisition. In this case, a client had an idea 
and, identifying Savarsh from personal history, approached with a general design. The 
jeweler worked out a number of ideas, was able to “flesh out” the clients stone inventory 
through his contacts with providers. The casting was especially large and complex, so it 
was modeled in house but “cast” by a specialty provider. Each individual stone in this very 
complex piece of jewelry will be hand set.

Shavarsh K Jewelry Design – (Close up – very complex example of jewelry) Shavarsh 
discussed and displays a perfect example of terminal development jewelry design: a 
confluence of discerning, aware clients, mature experience and master craftsmanship. 
Each individual stone in this very complex piece of jewelry will be hand set. “Bangle” in the 
jeweler’s left hand, working diagram at center (and much more comprehensive “program” 
of settings was developed on his computer), and the stone-set, in individually indexed zip-
locks, are in the plastic box.

Shavarsh K Jewelry Design – Although the so-called “lost wax” process is a process of great 
antiquity, the means of creating the source form has constantly been updated. The “void” 
created in the investment may simply be a duplicate of an existing object. Savarsh has been 
a leader, however, in computer aided design. This machine receives the final 3-D design – 
which allows the potential jewelry consumer to “preview” the likely outcome with much 
greater clarity and far less disappointment than traditional 2-D design renderings. It 
begins with an appropriately sized block of wax like material and removes not the design 
until a “copy” of the drawing exists. From that point, the process continues as it has from 
hundreds if not thousands of years.

Shavarsh K Jewelry Design – Shavarsh shows a thick “wax” blank, prior to being reduced 
by the machine, and a finished “model” of a 3-D drawing of a ring, ready to be attached to a 
little more wax (to form a channel down which metal  can flow) and a stem.
