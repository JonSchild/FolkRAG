I GOT A HOME IN NEW ORLEANS
But I got a home in New Orleans; I mean I want to see Black Alma; I mean Mrs. Helen
Green, but I mean Mrs. Helen Green. She's a sweet brown-skin woman, jes' as sweet as
the cold ice-cream. I say she's in New Orleans; She's a brown-skinned woman, sweetest
woman I ever seen, Ev'y time she give me new shirt she buy the black crepe machine (de
chine) She put my initial on de pocket, better than Mrs. Ella Green, I want to see Black
Alma; she's sweeter than cold ice-cream.
Sung by Clyde Hill (Negro convict), Clemens state farm, Brazoria, Texas, April 16, 1939.
