Born 1936, Honey Grove TX. Moved to Houston at age 3. Lived across the road from the 
Union Hall. Gang foreman would use money earned to drink. Could not say much against 
the gang foreman as would be labelled a radical and not get a job. Labor unions used to 
march down Main Street. Stepfather had 40+ years on the water. Cotton jammer and 
cotton screwer are same thing. Cotton was piece work. At 21 years old, went to work 
longshore and Cotton job. Also worked general cargo in the hold. Quartering time. 
Stepfather only worked cotton. Was also a great influence in his life.

Got involved in the port through step-father. Was cotton jammer the whole time. Would 
work in the hold. Went down to the port at 19 years. Needed a job. Got to carry 7-8 bags 
in a load. Did 35-40 tons in an hour. Unloaded cattle, on the hoof. Did not have a pension 
plan earlier. Had to set about creating one. One of the few industries that has not cut back 
on pension checks.

Rule of the dock, could not work a ship. Had a 180 days strike in the 60s. Back then, 
stevedores wanted to break the union. Started working grain boats, and then progressed to 
steel, general cargo, heavy lifts, etc. Had to make sure there was equipment to work all 
these jobs. Broke the strike this way. Worked 120 hrs a week for 5 years.

Started out working in the hold. Stepfather did not want him to work on the waterfront. 
Grew up knowing only longshoreman. In Houston could get turnkey jobs. Loaded the 
Western Hunter, biggest ship to ever leave the Port of Houston. The biggest grain load. 
Was a gear-man. Used to supply all materials that people are going to need, what would 
work, keep aside, load them and take to the venue. Gear-men were not part of gangs. 
Gear belonged to the company - Stevedore. Work has been extremely good.  
 
 Had a turnbuckle accident and lost the tip of finger. Had another accident and twisted 
back. Retired after foot accident (shows foot and scars). Year later had triple bypass.

Been politically active over the years. Believe strongly in the democratic party. Wife 
worked for Congressman. Wife was President of the Ladies Auxilliary Charter number 1. 
Their job was to take care of the men. When on strike, ladies got donations from nearby 
establishments to feed the men.  
 
Walking foreman handled the ship. Superintendent also present. Nowadays 
superintendent tells the walking foreman, gang foreman and the individuals what to do. 
Superintendents are from the company. Took all the power away from locals.

"We had the biggest bunch of misfits that ever gathered under one roof." Everybody had 
a different personality, different beliefs, different religions. "But when we went down and 
got on that ship, we came together and gave them as good a workforce as they could have 
possibly ever trained. " Trained each other. "Hang the whip."

Loved working under Ralph Langrez - best walking foreman. Jack Hashem best gang 
foreman.. Had the respect of everybody.  
 
57.50 
Everybody would hang out at bars together after work. Did get along with management.  
 
1.02.22 
Worked containers. Agreement "no retiree is allowed one red cent from container 
royalty." Container royalty came in to replace man hours. Been retired 24 years. Should 
stand up for retirees and working people. Have not had a raise in anything in the past two 
years. Still trying to promote the ILA. Son is a longshoreman. Harold and Terry both sons 
work at the port. Checkers job - "bunch of prima donnas"

1979 ran for state Rep. Ran against Mike Jackson. He won by 8% of the points. 
Interested in the labor movement. Easier to campaign for somebody else than it is for 
oneself. Father wouldn't even go to union meetings. Son Harold is at the ILA. Terry was 
at fire department for 22 years. Retired with $3000 a month and went back to work at 
checkers local. Worked for a year and ran for business agent.  
 
1.17.12 
Business agent calls people about available jobs. Union used to be a lot stronger. Saw 
labor's strength on Labor Day. Would walk down Main street hand in hand. Did not come 
to barbecues.  
 
1.20.23 
 
 
Could blame our leadership for Labor Day not holding any importance for this 
generation. Was raised on waterfront. Pollution in Deer Park from companies. Container 
ships can be unloaded and reloaded in 48 hours.  
 
1.25.31 
Before containerization loading and unloading would take a 7-10 days and ships would 
remain for so long. 16- 18 men on one ship. Now, three gangs, ten men to a gang. 
Loading and unloading almost unreal.  
 
1.26.37 
Can work with non union people for one tenth of union employees. Conditions, benefits, 
wages difference in wages. If there was no insurance and only had to pay a wage with no 
pension plan, cuts payroll way back.
