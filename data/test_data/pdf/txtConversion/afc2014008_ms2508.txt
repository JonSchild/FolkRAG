"Partir, c
'est mourir un peu.. . ."
 How shrewdly the French language can
 
drive home a nail, thought Mrs. Miniver, seeing again in her mind's eye the
 
row of smiling faces to which she had waved a regretful good-bye, the evening
 
before, from the window of the l
ittle Alpine train.  At her sister-in-law's
 
request she had travelled out with her niece Alison, who was going to spend
 
six months living with a Swill family; and she had stayed on for a week at a
 
pension in the same village, just to see that Alison was happily established.
 
The whole family
' had come to see her off at the station.  The solitary porter,
 
standing beside his yellow toy barrow, had had a grass stalk between his teeth;
 
and the moon, just topping the Mittelhorn, had looked for the space of a breath
 
or two like a vast snow-ball which was about to roll down the glacier.
 
But why, she wondered, as the serene but unjoyful landscape of northern
 
France s
lid past the dining-car windows -
-
 the white horses, the dun cattle,
 
the red farms, the grey shutters, the beaded cemeteries, the hedgeless fields
 
like foreheads without eyebrows -
-
 why has nobody ever made the parallel obser-
vation:
 "Revenir, c
'est savoir ce que c
'est que d
'etre un revenant"?  That would
 
be no less shrewd: for when you first come home from a strange place you are
 
always something of a ghost.  They were sorry when you went away, and they welcome
 
you back with affection: but in the meanwhile they have adjusted their lives a
 
little to your absence.  For the first meal or two, there i
s not quite enough
 
room for your chair.  They ask, "Where did you go?  What was it l
ike?"; but
 
for the l
ife of you you cannot tell them.  You can say, "It was l
ike a large,
 
neat Scotland"; or "They use nonante instead of quatre-vingt-dix"; or "They
 
trim all their buildings with wooden lace"; or "There was a nice l
ittle German
 
boy staying at the pension"; or "
I made friends with a charming farmer at the
 
village fete."  But however eagerly they l
isten they do not really take in
 
what you are saying.  For you cannot make them understand the essential point,
 
which is that when you went away you took the centre of the universe with you,
 
so that the whole thing went on revolving, just as usual, round your own head.
 
How could they, indeed, be expected to believe this, when they know quite well
 
that all the time the centre of everything stayed at home with them?  It is a
 
day or two, as a rule, before your universe and theirs (
like the two images in
 
a photographic range-finder) merge and become concentric; and when that happens,
 
you know you are really home.

Dear Bess:
 Nick gave me your email address and said that you had not seen
 
this post that  I made to Publore right after Alan's funeral.
 I am
 
forwarding this to you now.
 I hope that you are doing well,  I think that
 
this has been a difficult year for all of us  .

 and I send my love and
 
best wishes to you for a healthy and productive year ahead.

FOCUS :
 
by Vicky B

outh Editor
 
THE T
1LIGHT Z
ONE:  The s
eventh grade has
 
b
een studying magic and
 
the supernatural this year, so Mrs. G
old-
b
erg called upon ROD SERLING to speak to
 
the 7th, 8th, H
igh School I and H
. S
. II
 
classes on this subject,
 
During the discussion,
 
questions were asked, many t
o the teach-
erts despair having nothing to do with
 
the supernatural.  Most of them were a-
bout Mr. Serling's show, The T
vlight Z
one.
 
Don Morris asked i
f the fact that Mr. Ser-
ling i
s a Unitarian has anything to do
 
with the ideas of the show.  The answer
 
was yes.  Mr. Serling s
eemed t
o f
eel that
 
every p
erson needed to express himself
 
and his i
deas, and the Twlight Z
one was
 
h
is way of d
oing s
o.
 
The t
alk was first
 
meant t
o b
e on the s
upernatural, but as
 
the s
tudents b
ecame more and m
ore inter-
ested in Mr. Serling's show, its meaning,
 
and its background, any dreams Mrs. Gold-
berg may have had f
or a high l

I

of them are on the floor catching leaks)
 
with foil.  Put in 6

Bake at 350  for 1 and 3

every 15 minutes.

grade's adored teacher, was banned from
 
his c
lass, while MARY ASHER , (
the room
 
mother) and the class worked on "pro-
j
ect- X
."  Each child c
ontributed t
o
 
the purchase of 2 gifts, a layette from
 
the girls, a sweater from the boys. When
 
the gifts were displayed
.,. prior to wrap-
ping  the girls "
0000hhed"; the boys
 
"
ughhhed." Then they wrapped. Next, the
 
boys drew a s
croll for the baby, and
 
the girls drew a sro1l for the baby.
 
The girls' s
croll was a pastel colored
 
depiction of babyhood, springtime,
 
showers, flowers and loveliness. The
 
boys' turned out s
omething of a July 4th
 
n
iotiff-  missiles, rockets, guns, bombs,
 
ships, ptc. Mrs. A
sher c
ommented that
 
perhaps it was not appropriate. "Well,
 
the kid might' gro  'o and be an a

can question logic like, that??  The
 
motiff was approved by a stymied Mary

OMNIS SPIRITUS' LAUDET DOMINUM
 
The above was prefixed to the "Psalmes, Sonets, &
 
s
ongs of sadnes and pietie," of William Byrd, l5P8-
 
who, apparently, f
ound it necessary t
o do a bit of
 
promoting to recruit his singers.
 
B
elow are penned some lines by another Director of
 
Music, 1962 -  who, similarly, is wanting f
or s
ome
 
voices:
 
"
The level of intellect and the progressive spirit of this
 
church demand an appropriate cultural representation —
 particularly in music.
 
For music has t
raditionally provided to religious endeavors much of their
 
g
reatest inspiration.
 
"
In one and a half year, our choir has reached a level of
 
a
chievement n
ot often found in churches, particularly of small size. A
s we
 
add t
o our numbers, the range of music we c
an sing will widen; we will even
 
be able to s
ing when there are a f
ew absences.
 
"
What s
ort of p
eople can best s
erve and be s
erved by our
 
choir?  Those who desire to blend both their voices and their personalities
 
f
or a while to achieve a common g
oal:  that pinnacle of human achievement - 
an excellent p
erformance of a fine work of music.

IXER OF MIDNIGHT
 Reuel Denney
 
I
 
He went to fix the awning,
 
Fix the roping,
 
In the Middle of the night,
 
On the porch;
 
He went to fix the awning,
 
In pajamas went to fix it,
 
Fix the awning,
 
In the middle of the moonlight,
 
On the porch;
 
He went to fix it yawning,
 
The yawning of this awning
 
In the moonlight
 
Was his problem of the night;
 
I
t was knocking,
 
And he went to fix its flight.
 
He went to meet the moonlight
 
In the porch-night
 
Where the awning was up dreaming
 
Dark and l
ight;
 
It was shadowy and seeming;
 
In the night, the unfixed awning,
 
In his nightmare,
 
Had been knocking dark and bright.
 
I
t seemed late
 
To stop it in its dark careening.
 
The yawner went to meet it,
 
Meet the awning,
 
By the moon of middle-night,
 
On his porch;
 
And he went to fix it right.

REPORT ON OHIO APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AS OF OCTOBER 18,  1984
 
I met with Tim Lloyd and Liz Harzof in Columbus,
 Ohio on October
 
18  and  19.
 Throughout  the 18th we went over what  they  have
 
done with the apprenticeship program to date.
 The planned visit
 
to  Laotian  master of kaen (bamboo free-reed  wind
 instrument),
 
Bounsou  Champhavannarath,
 and  his apprentice, Phomma  Sensy,  in
 
Columbus was cancelled due to the  i
llness of one and the unavail-
ability  of the other.
 We reviewed the 18  applications,
 their
 
application and granting forms,
 their news  release,
 newsletter
 
and  other pertinent published material.
 They had returned  all
 
supporting  materials sent in with applications,
 such as  slides
 
and tapes.
 I suggested they ask in future to have materials sent
 
which  they could keep on file which would be useful  in examining
 
development  and  for  other  reference.
 When  we  had  talked
 
ourselves
 out we looked at a f
ilm,
 Refugee Road ,made by  Ohioan
 
Tom Hayes (there are 9,000 SE Asian refugees settled in Ohio)
 
and a video production,
 The Common Thread.
 The film showed the
 
desperate
 plight and anxiety of resettling from rural
 to  urban
 
l
ife
 in  a  new part of the world without the
 language  or  any
 
comprehension  of the lifestyle.
 It was helpful background  for
 
understanding  this  program which is currently  being  developed
 
principally
 for SE Asians.
 On the following day we made a site
 
visit some two hours southeast of Colulmbus.
 
The  apprenticeship program is set up as outlined in the  October
 
83 proposal to NEA.
 Promotion of the program was through direct
 
contact with appropriate organizations/indivi duals and indirectly
 
through a large mailing, the OAC newsletter, and a press release,
 
(which  brought one application for papermaking -not
 funded  but
 
directed  to another program).
 The application blank is  simple
 
and straightforward covering all needed material except age.
 For
 
the
 next
 period
 date  of  birth  will
 be
 requested
 and
 
information that only one apprentice will be funded per master  - 
in  order  spread the funding.
 Information  requested
 includes
 
description  of  apprenticeship  desired  (what,
 how,
 when  and
 
where),
 supplies needed,
 apprentice and master backgrounds, and
 
support materials.
 The grants letter deals with amount granted,
 
payment dates, site visits by staff and/or panel, photos and tape
 
recordings and f
inal reports.
 In this f
irst period masters were
 
found  by  hopeful
 apprentices,
 they  arrived  at  a  mutually
 
agreeable
 arrangement
 and
 the  apprentice
 submitted
 the
 
application.
 As
 the  program progresses
 information  will
 be
 
gathered  about  potential masters who may then be encouraged  to
 
be available to potential apprentices.
 There were only two weeks
 
between  application deadline and panel meeting,
 not  sufficient
 
time
 to  check  out qualifications of  masters  or  apprentices.
 
There
 will
 be six weeks between the next -
 January  1
,
 1985  - 
deadline and the panel meeting to fund the grants on February 15.
 
1
 
In  this
 f
irst granting period the panel made decisions  on  the
 
basis  of prior knowledge (particularly that of Dr.
 Terry Miller
 
on
 SE Asian music),
 and from the supplementary material.
 One
 
site visit was made to master of traditional vaudeville-style tap
 
dancing,
 Jerry Reed, in Toledo because supplementary material was
 
insufficient.
 In spite of time shortage this round it is  clear
 
from  the  applications  that it was not difficult  to  make
 the
 
choices.
 Those
 masters funded have long experience with  their
 
art, are community embedded, as are their apprentices.
 Those not
 
funded either had not defined the apprenticeship sufficiently, or
 
belonged
 in some other program,
 or were essentially revivalist.
 
An  example of the latter is an application from Mary Jo  Dickman
 
who performs frequently with The Dry Branch Fire Squad.
 
There  were
 fewer applications from SE Asians than  expected  (7
 
out of 19).
 Two were funded, one apprentice withdrew (apparently
 
due
 to political schism within the Lao  community),
 the
 others
 
were  asked  to Improve application (with help) and resubmit,
 or
 
suggestions  were
 made
 for them to apply to the  OAC  Technical
 
Assistance
 Program.
 There  will be continual outreach  to  the
 
communities of Vietnamese,
 Laotian,
 Cambodian and Hmong  people
 
to f
ind master artists and possible apprentices and to get beyond
 
the  difficulties of communication and the unsettledness of these
 
newcomers.
 
Presently
 funded  apprentices  and masters  are  all
 culturally
 
matched and with the exception of one, reside  in the same town or
 
city.
 These are, of course, the  ideal conditions for the appren-
ticeship mode of learning.
 There will be two apprentices working
 
with  Jerry Reed but staff and panel have decided that  in  future
 
there should be only one apprentice per master at a time.
 
The 8 apprenticeships funded are Laotian kaen playing,
 Hungarian
 
embroidery
 ,
 Slovenian  style  polka  accordian,
 traditional
 
vaudeville-style
 tap  dancing
 (2),
 old-time
 mountain  fiddle,
 
country gospel guitar and vocal,
 and Hmong music on various wind
 
instruments.
 One  half  of  the
 $16,000 for  grants  has  been
 
reserved
 for the January 1 deadline:
 the present  grants  range
 
from  $1,000 to $1,500 except for a tiny one of $192 for the old-
time
 f
iddler (who must be really old-time).
 An  Elijah  Pierce
 
Memorial
 Apprenticeship has been established for woodworking and
 
will
 be
 granted in the next period i
f there  is  an  appropriate
 
request,  in addition to granting the other $8,000.
 
A breakdown of the f
irst grants is as follows:
 
by discipline -
 5 music,  2 dance,  1 craft
 
by ethnic group -
 1 Hmong,
 1 Lao,
 1 Hungarian,  1 Slovakian,  2
 
Anglo,  2 Black Americans
 
by gender -
 masters/ 5 male,
 2 female:
 apprentices/ 4 male,  3
 
female
 
by place -
 1 Coluimbus,
 1 Youngstown,  1 Cleveland,  3 Toledo,  1
 
Danville,  1 Jackson

S
 
During  the
 visit
 Tim and I made to June  Radcliff  and  Bethel
 
Downard
 in  Wellston,
 June spoke of her early  beginnings  with
 
guitarplaying (age  14), her continuous playing and singing in the
 
region,
 alone,
 as
 leader of several groups over the years  and
 
currently often with her apprentice,
 Bethel.
 The two women are
 
both
 in their 505 and the rapport between them is  clear.
 June
 
composes  both gospel and country songs and accompanies  herself.
 
June plays mandolin,
 fiddle, bass, piano and autoharp as well as
 
guitar. She sang for us alone and with Bethel and is a very solid
 
musician.
 June has been helping Bethel for two years.
 Bethel  is
 
shy and calls herself a "
nervous" person,
 but is obviously drawn
 
out  and strengthened in her music by June.
 June  is  a  natural
 
teacher,
 concerning  herself with Bethel's total needs,
 such as
 
getting  her out to play in public."
 The grant will allow  them
 
to  put aside time to work on problems Bethel has with timing  on
 
guitar,
 phrasing
 and  delivery
 in  gospel
 singing.
 This
 
apprenticeship will be low-key and flexible and ,
I feel,
 is well
 
worth the funding i
t will receive.
 
The concerns I had about the program as originally outlined  have
 
been  allayed.
 It  appeared that the burden of setting  up  the
 
arrangements  and reporting fell too much to the apprentice.
 In
 
fact  the planning has been mutually undertaken and  both  master
 
and apprentice will make final reports.
 There was no requirement
 
of  the master to define what will be taught in the time period - 
the different stages,
 the specific goals, the level of expertise
 
to  be expected.
 Outlining of this sort clarifies the  process,
 
helps  everyone
 to  see  what
 is  happening  and  to  evaluate.
 
Especially
 in  craft  apprenticeships,
 if the  content  of  the
 
apprenticeship
 i
s left too general,it is possible for  a  subtle
 
form of exploitation to result -
 too much sweeping floors and not
 
enough  making pots.
 Tim and Liz and I discussed this issue  at
 
length  and
 I believe they will  incorporate the  ideas in  future
 
guidelines.
 Also
 I  wondered about the unwieldy  size
 of  the
 
Advisory Panel, but as It has such diversity it has been and will
 
be useful.
 Finally,
 I was skeptical about breaking the program
 
into two 6-month periods.
 However, since any apprenticeship may
 
be conducted over the period of a year,
 I now see the advantages
 
of being able to make adjustments soon if they are necessary, and
 
that individuals may reapply in a shorter time.
 
The  panel
 membership  consists  now  of  Howard  Sachs
 (chair,
 
folklore  at  Kenyon College),
 Phyllis Brzozowska
 (director  of
 
Cityfolk- a  presenting organization),
 Rick Goehring
 (furniture
 
maker-not
 traditional),
 Terry Miller
 (ethnomusicologist,
 Kent
 
State),
 Marcia McxDowell  (folkarts division, Michigan State) and
 
alternates Jack Schortledge (folklorist with Trumbell County Arts
 
Council),
 Ricky Clark (F.
 quilt historian and curator,
 Oberlin
 
College).
 They  expect
 to widen the panel to extend  areas  of
 
expertise  and  to
 include a folk artist.
 There  will
 be
 3-4
 
members  with  an additional 6-iO people who will be  called  for
 
meetings where their knowledge  is needed.
 
3
 
In-sum,  the Ohio program is well launc
hed. 
The  approach
 has  been
 
based on solid thought and appropriate outreach.
 The staff and,
 
I
 would
 judge
 from  results,
 the  panel
 together  have  an
 
understanding  of  and sensitivity for this old way  of
 learning
 
which we are redefining to work today,
 and for the cultures  and
 
individuals  who will be  involved.
 I would  recommend that  the
 
Folk Arts Panel fund the Ohio program for another year.

Report on New York site visit for Apprenticeship Program,
 
October 29,30 and 31,  1984
 
October
 29 and 30 I met with two master-apprentice pairs and two
 
other  masters alone and read the applications just received  for
 
1985  grants.
 Paula  Kascel,
 Catherine  Schwoefferman  and  I
 
discussed  the  program
 in bits of time  in the
 midst  of  their
 
preparation for the panel meeting.
 On October 30 I attended the
 
panel
 meeting which selected the applications to receive  grants
 
for 1985.
 
From  talking with some participants in last year's  program  and
 
hearing  staff  advise panel about others who  applied  again,
 I
 
judge
 the actual apprenticeships to have been successful and
 in
 
keeping  with the NEA Folk Arts guidelines for the program.
 The
 
masters are well-known for their skills and are bearers and  able
 
transmitters  of the wider cultural expression.
 The apprentices
 
are from the same cultural group,
 were already well  into the art
 
form  and  have duly advanced their  skills.
 The
 matches  were
 
successful;
 the  pairs knew what they were seeking and appear to
 
have gotten i
t.
 To a certain extent this has come about through
 
beginners
 luck  -
 or  to be more  precise,
 because
 there  were
 
obvious and known masters with apprentices waiting in the wings.
 
There  has  not  been sufficient contact between  NYSCA  and  the
 
applicant  organizations  or  NYSCA and  masters
 I  apprentices.
 
This
 situation has come about because there has been no fulltime
 
Folk  Arts Coordinator since Robert Baron left the position  last
 
February.
 There
 i
s no question that  Catherine  Schwoefferman,
 
working part t
ime on the content of the program and Paula Kascel,
 
f
itting  administrative details into her other fulltime work have
 
done as well as they could.
 I will go into these problems below.
 
I  also  believe this year's grants will have  positive  results,
 
although the lack of full-time coordinator will continue
 through
 
much of next year.
 
To give you an idea of the quality of last year's apprenticeships
 
I will describe what I gathered by meeting with some of them.
 
1
)
 With  Frisner Augustin,
 Haitian master of  ritual
 (Vodoun)
 
drumming.
 1984  grant  $2,200
 ($1,200 for  master;
 $720  for
 
apprentice; $300 for supplies (drum).
 
Both Augustin and his apprentice,
 Franck  Sylvain,
 learned
 
drumming
 in i
t's traditional context -
 Vodoun religious services
 
-and  perform the associated dances in a troupe.
 Augustin is  a
 
reknowned  Haitian  drummer who began learning by  attending  his
 
uncle's performances at age 7.
 From age 10 (
in 1958) he  played
 
the simplest of the three drums,  the Boula, and traveled with his
 
uncle
 to perform in Mexico and the US.
 He has been in NY since
 
1973  and  has taught -
 before that  in Haiti,
 and since
 in  NY.
 
1
 
Performing and teaching are his sole l
lvllhood.
 When he travels
 
to Haiti he takes students with him to show them where he and the
 
music come from.
 
Augustin's apprentice,
 Franck Sylvain,
 began to play at age
 12
 
and  prior  to  the apprenticeship was coached informally  as  he
 
drummed and danced with Augustin's troupe.
 There are three drums
 
used;
 Boula,
 l
ittle  drum  played with two sticks and a  bell;
 
Segan, a larger drum; Manman,  largest and master drum for solo or
 
lead playing.
 The apprenticeship concentrated on Manman playing
 
and  on overall concept of this music -
-
 including where and  how
 
to
 break  rythm
 into  a  different  pattern  for
 relaxation.
 
He  described it as developing a sense of timing for a change
 in
 
rythm  which i
s conveyed back and forth between  musicians  and
 
dancers.
 
Franck  worked  with  Augustin 2 hours on 2 days a  week
 for  9
 
months.
 Augustin  said time was adequate for substantial growth
 
and  learning;
 that  he  was conveying  to  his  apprentice
 the
 
seriousness  of
 the music in terms of  ritual
 meaning.
 Franck
 
taped their sessions and worked daily at home on them.
 
This  apprenticeship  was
 funded for continued work in
 1985  to
 
cover
 2 hours a week for 24 weeks to learn thoroughly 24  rythms
 
and breaks.
 This grant is for $1,650 ($960 to master,
 $640  to
 
apparentice,
 $30 for supplies).
 The  intensived learning of this
 
apprenticeship  could not have taken place without funds for  the
 
apprentice.
 
2)
 With Jelon Vieira, master, and Herbert Kerr, apprentice
 
Capoeira,
 Brazilian gymnastic martial art form.
 1984 grant was
 
for  $2,125
 ($1,500 for master;
 $500 for apprentice,
 $100  for
 
supplies, $50 for travel).
 
This  art form was developed by Angolan slaves,
 with the  ritual
 
combat  disguised as dance so  i
t could be practised  openly.
 It
 
was used by slaves who escaped to the hills to avoid capture.
 It
 
i
s described as a discipline requiring a synthesis of mind
 
(concentration), body (movement), and spirit (ritual).
 Level of
 
accomplishment
 i
s  signified  by color of sash or cord  worn  -
-
from white to red which signifies complete mastery.
 There are
 
only  two red cords in US and Vieira wears one.
 In Brazil now
 
Capoeira i
s second only to soccer as a popular form.
 The  dance
 
i
s done  i
n a circle.
 Musicians put energy into circle,
 dancers
 
put i
t  back out to them.
 The audience stands around the  circle
 
and joins chorus  in a chant or answer,
 thereby participating and
 
adding  to energy.
 It requires 8 -
 10 years to master the  art.
 
Vieira says "you become the art .
 He chooses to teach people who
 
will
 pass I
t on.
 In the end,
 Kerr said,
 You pick up a spoon
 
differently,
"  
2
 
Vielra
 learned  the
 form as a child on the
 streets
 in  Bahia,
 
Brazil,
 later  studying with famous Mestre Bimba,
 practised and
 
performed in US since 1973.
 His apprentice, Kerr, began studying
 
with him in 1979 and during apprenticeship has passed from  green
 
to  purple  cord from which level he  is able to assist Vieira
 in
 
teaching lower cord levels.
 
Tasks
 of  the completed apprenticeship were:  to master  the
 f
ive
 
instrumen ts used in performance.
 (Each level has its own rythms
 
of music and song to which the dance  is related);
 to master  the
 
dance
 of the purple cord;
 to learn the songs  in  Portugese;
 to
 
gain  knowledge and understanding of ritual setting of each level
 
of  Capoe Ira.;
 to  teach  basics  to  others.
 The  master  and
 
apprentice traveled together to Brazil to see,  learn, perform.
 
Vielra  says last year's apprenticeship was for 2-3 hours,
 three
 
or more times a week for five months,
 with apprentice practising
 
on  own daily.
 He always taught overtime and always  worked  on
 
understanding and background of form as well as skills.
 His only
 
complaint was that there were no site visits to them as promised.
 
This  year's application with a different apprentice (one of  two
 
requests  was funded)  involves the same work at a lower level and
 
i
s
 for $3100 ($1500 for master;
 $650 for apprentice,
 $300  for
 
supplies, $65 for travel).
 
3)
 For  Sahomi
 Tachibana,
 master  and  Theodora
 Yoshikami,
 
apprentice.
 Classical Japanese folk dance.
 From discussion with
 
both  and  viewing  videotape the apprenticeship  was  completely
 
successful.
 I will spare you the details though I have them
 i
f
 
you  ever  need them.
 A continuation of this apprenticeship
 in
 
1985  was
 funded for $2,500 (request was for  $6,350)  and  will
 
involve the learning of two dances new to the apprentice.
 
4)
 For Edgar King, master of Panamian West Indian dance, adapted
 
from  Scottish-English Quadrille and Cotillion  dancing.
 I  was
 
f
inally  convinced that the dance had become truly a West
 Indian
 
art
 form in Panama (developed by islanders who came to build the
 
Canal) because the talk of the suppporting group was so vivid and
 
enthusiastic, but I did not see the dance.
 It obviously involves
 
considerable  pride and enthic cohesiveness for these  people
 in
 
the  heart  of Brooklyn.
 The New Muse Community Museum did  not
 
apply this year for an apprenticeship for this art form.
 
The
 principal
 problem  for the New York program is lack  of  a
 
full-time  coordinator resulting in insufficient contact  between
 
staff  and applicant organizations,
 (which need  guidance),
 and
 
masters/apprentices.
 With  the exception of 5-6 site visits
 in
 
her area by Catherine, all discussion, arrangements and guidance
 
3
 
has been done by phone.
 Hopefully this problem will be solved In
 
the  coming year and meanwhile the newly  funded  apprenticeships
 
look  good and Catherine expects to be able to do more  extensive
 
site visits this winter/spring.
 
On September 20,
 1984 NYSCA approved formation of an Independent
 
FA program to begin Spring 1985 with its own budget and full time
 
professional
 staff.
 Mary Hayes believes increased funding will
 
be  appropriated  by the legislature to cover  this  program  and
 
overall support of NYSCA to FA will  increase by 33%.
 
Catherine began her part-time work on the project early in May so
 
there  was a "black hole" for two months.
 Then an article  went
 
out
 in NYSCA newsletter,
 followed by letter explaining  program
 
sent  to  organizations and all known  contacts,
 including  some
 
masters, and all previous applicants for other FA programs. Those
 
interested were contacted.
 Catherine determined appropriateness
 
of master by questions such as:
 where, when, how did you learn?
 
what  are  processes involved?
 is art form  practised
 locally?
 
Then she verified Information through other people.
 For the most
 
part  masters were sure of what and how they would teach and knew
 
a  potential
 apprentice.
 Others  needed  help
 in  formulating
 
the stages of the process.
 The masters and apprentices all knew
 
one another and had planned the apprenticeship before applying.
 
After  applications were received (September 3) Catherine was
 in
 
contact
 to  verify
 information and to  obtain  further  support
 
materials.
 
There
 were
 26  grant applications for  1985  totaling  *58,000.
 
Fourteen grants were made from the *33,050 of available funds.
 
Some were eliminated as inappropriate (e.g.
 percussion  notation
 
for  African musical theory),
 some for not being endangered  FA,
 
one  because
 i
t  was the third application this  year  from  one
 
organization
 (Akwesasne Museum -
 for native American  sweetgrass
 
basketry).
 An example of a problem which could have been avoided
 
i
f  there had been direct contact by a knowledgeable person was a
 
request for false face mask,
 traditional Iroquois wood  carving.
 
The
 Broome
 County  Historical Society planned to  document  the
 
process  and product for presentation to the public,
 but
 i
t
 i
s
 
forbidden  to  publicize
 this religious symbol
 and  would  have
 
stirred  great controversy among the Iriquols.
 The  application
 
was not funded but could perhaps been channeled differently to be
 
acceptable.
 
I  made
 the
 following  suggestions to Paula  and  Catherine
 in
 
discussions  at the end of my visit on the need for which we  are
 
in agreement.
 
-
 direct and skilled contact with masters,
 apprentices,
 and
 
applicant organizations.
 
-
 develop
 knowledge
 in
 FA
 organizations
 about
 the
 
apprenticeship  programs  so they may help  develop  and  nurture
 
individual
 apprenticeships,
 locate
 masters,
 apprentices  and
 
4
 
a-
'1
 
endangered art forms.
 
-
 use
 panel
 or  a  Board of Advisors  with  specialists
 in
 
various
 f
ields  as an ongoing group to be called on  during  the
 
year for advice or to make site visits.
 
-
 use
 panel
 for policy decisions.
 This was  not  done  at
 
October
 3
1st meeting and there are several outstanding issues as
 
well
 as a lack of overview.
 Issue examples are:
 second  year
 
funding
 (
it was done but no concensus on whether it should  be);
 
more
 than on"application per organization;
 continued
 focus  on
 
endangered  FA;
 whether  to require standards of  conformity
 in
 
applications and In quality of support materials.
 
-
 require
 f
inal
 reports from one year to be  available
 for
 
following  year's  panel to provide some view on how  program
 Is
 
going.
 There was one report available this year and it was very
 
i
lluminating.
 
-
 explain  the  whys  of  rejections  and  where  appropriate
 
suggest reapplying with constructive help in doing so.
 
-
 some applications were for very short time,  for example the
 
false face mask carving would have been for 7-8 days.
 This  may
 
be alright, but needs discussion.
 
-
 suggest
 in  guidelines necessity of apprentice to work  on
 
own
 inbetween
"lessons ",  since contact time  is short
 in  many
 
cases.
 
I  recommend continued funding because  important transmission
 is
 
going  on
 in these apprenticeships,
 but with  watchful  eye
 on
 
staff-field  contact this year and,
 of course,
 for the probable
 
fuller staffing for the program in the spring of 1985.
 I plan to
 
make
 site visits outside of NYC later in the
 winter,
 hopefully
 
with Catherine Schwoefferman.

Report on Pennsylvania Site Visit for Apprenticeship Program
 
November 2
, 3, 4, and 5,  1984
 
November
 2  Shalom  Staub  and  I met  with  master  artists
 in
 
Philadelphia,
 two
 Ukrainian
 embroiderers
 from
 separate
 
organizations (one with her apprentice),
 and a Hmong  appliquer.
 
The
 following  day  we  drove NW of  Harrisburg  to  visit
 four
 
qullters
 (3  masters,
 1  apprentice)
 with  the  head  of  the
 
organization which requested funds for 9 apprentices to work with
 
5 masters.
 On November 4, we visited a gypsy willow basketmaker
 
south  of  Harrisburg  and a Cambodian silk weaver in  the  city.
 
The Panel meeting was on November 5.
 
As
 I write of these visits some of the problems of this  program
 
will become apparent.
 The Ukrainian embroidery masters were both
 
very
 skilled  and  dedicated  to  preservation  of  the  craft.
 
Stefanja  Shumsky Myer appeared to be more of a teacher  and  her
 
organization,
 the
 Ukrainian  Heritage Studies Center,
 a  solid
 
presenting  organization  to work with and  build  on.
 She  has
 
embroidered  for  display  and teaching  purposes  an
 impressive
 
collection of stitch and pattern samplers, backed on cardboard.
 
Since
 the  embroidery  patterns  have  regional,
 village
 and
 
sometimes even family differences,
 she will teach the details of
 
design,
 color,
 stitch  to  preserve
 the  authenticity.
 The
 
apprenticeship will take place at Manor Jr. College (which houses
 
the
 Center  and i
ts Museum) 3 days a month for 7  months.
 Vira
 
Nakonehy, her apprentice, whom we met, will carry out assignments
 
between sessions.
 The College will provide bed and food for the
 
apprentice during her stays.
 Vira has been embroidering for some
 
time  and on completion of the apprenticeship it is expected  she
 
will
 be qualified to teach beginners in the regular  classes  at
 
the
 Center.
 One obseravatlon that Shalom and I made after  the
 
two Ukrainian visits  i
s that these people, and presumably most of
 
the community,  is hanging on hard to the past, trying to recreate
 
something of what they lost.
 This is natural enough perhaps, but
 
tends to be rigid and isolating.
 It doesn't seem to be a living,
 
growing tradition.
 They are the ultimate  in preservation, and at
 
this  extreme
 it seems limiting.
 This is just a  philosiphical
 
obeservation,
 not a judgement on the need for these great skills
 
to be passed on.
 
By  contrast,
 the Hmong appliquer,
 Pan Xiong  Sirirathasak,
 i
s
 
combining  preservation of the fabric skills she brought to  this
 
country  with her by creating them both for Hmong ritual use  and
 
adapting  them for American use.
 The latter is accomplished  by
 
making squares,
 using traditional patterns,
 color and stitches,
 
and using them to piece bedcovers,  to make pocketbooks, placemats
 
and napkin sets (embroidered only at one edge) and smaller
 i
tems
 
such  as pin cushions,
 eyeglass cases.
 These adaptations allow
 
the  women  to keep the traditionality of their  needlework
 (and
 
batik)
 while earning necessary money.
 The bedcovers  sell
 for
 
1
 
*5-800.
 
There  are
 young women interested in being apprentices (age 9  - 
17) who cannot learn it at home because their mothers have jobs.
 
There  will
 be 15 four-hour sessions  on  successive  Saturdays,
 
taught  by  three master craftswomen.
 The grant of  *3,000  was
 
funded  through  the Folkilfe Center of International
 House
 of
 
Philadelphia.
 Carole  Boughter  made the visit with us  and
 is
 
clearly
 in  close  touch  with the
 two  masters,
 some
 of  the
 
apprentices  who  were  also  present (as well  as  other  family
 
members) despite language difficulties.
 She has known Pan Xiong
 
for 3 years and Is completely accepted by the Hmong group.
 Since
 
this is an experienced applicant organization,
 we feel sure
 the
 
contacts  needed  to nurture this apprenticeship program will
 be
 
kept.
 
The application for several quilting apprenticeships from  Central
 
Pa.
 Village Crafts gave us little confidence,
 and in fact, only
 
one
 of the five was funded.
 The organization,
 a  Coop,
 bends
 
everything  toward  marketing success.
 For  example,
 when  one
 
woman's  design
 for a quilt or pillow cover sells well,
 2 or  3
 
others are trained to make  i
t with certain fabrics and colors  so
 
the
 item may be wholesaled.
 While the quilters certainly  want
 
the
 income,
 they  seem  submissive to this  element  and  their
 
assignments from the Coop.
 An old problem, severe enough here so
 
they  are
 loosing  their sense of their  own  creativeness.
 In
 
addition  and
 for  the same reasons,
 the
 match  of  master  to
 
apprentice was entirely made  in the head of Patricia Macneal, the
 
Coop's
 manager.
 She
 told  me she knew the
 strengths  of  the
 
masters,
 what
 they  need  to pass on,
 who  of  her  apprentice
 
teachers  can best learn from them,
 and who will get along in  a
 
match?
 The
 masters and apprentices have not met to discuss  an
 
apprenticeship,
 do  not know each other In most cases,
 and  the
 
masters  have
 not  been asked to formulate  any  teaching  plan.
 
Pearl
 Baumgardner
 (age 90) was funded to pass on her Pico  edge
 
technique and her Snowball pattern,
 though she was worried about
 
who  the apprentice would be,
 and said  1 don't know  what
 I'11
 
teacha.
 What
 she
 will teach did take form during  this  visit.
 
This  application
 i
s an example of the weakness of some
 of  the
 
applicant
 organizations  and  of  the craft  as  opposed  to  FA
 
approach  of  the PCA,
 and some of the organizations  they  have
 
worked with for craft programs.
 
The  gypsy willow basketmaker apprenticeship (funded for  *3,000)
 
Is  very  sound,
 although  here again,
 the master and  his
 two
 
apprentices  had not met,
 nor was there any  work  plan.
 Lewis
 
Reinhart is clearly a master of his art.
 He makes baskets mostly
 
for  Mennonite  and Amish farm use,
 but also sells them  now  at
 
Fairs.
 He grows his own willow and has been making baskets since
 
he was 12.
 He was born in a tent and only in the past decade has
 
his
 family owned land and ended their wanderings.
 He described
 
the  picking
 (with  sap for white,
 later in  season  for  brown
 
willow),
 aging, soaking of reeds and structuring of baskets.
 He
 
2
 
has pride  in their strength and utility.
 The two apprentices,
 
both  experienced basketmakers,
 will travel  160 and 60 miles  to
 
work  with  Reinhart
 for 3 consecutive days  each  month  for  7
 
months.
 The applicant organization, The Folk Heritage Institute,
 
has  arranged for the two women to be put up during the  sessions
 
locally.
 
This
 Is an endangered art form and Reinhart is clearly a master,
 
articulate about the process.
 We need to watch the length of an
 
apprenticeship  requiring  such difficult  skills -to  understand
 
how  much can be accomplished in a relatively short period of  21
 
days.
 The apprentices will be practising inbetween sessions.
 
The
 visit  with  Bun  Em turned out to be a tour  de
 force
 for
 
Shalom.
 We
 met in the Market Square Church in Harrisburg  with
 
members of the Historical Society of Dauphin County,
 a woman who
 
has engendered the silk weaving and other programs for SE Asians,
 
and Bun Em,
 her young translator (she has been here 3 years,
 is
 
67,
 speaks no English),
 and several members of her family.
 For
 
the f
irst part of the meeting the organizers spoke of her and the
 
program as though she were not present.
 (She was sitting against
 
a  wall and I did not even realize she was the
 master).
 Shalom
 
drew  her to the center of the meeting and began to question  her
 
through  the translator.
 A whole other set of assumptions  came
 
from her about the arrangements,
 about which she had never  been
 
clear.
 
She was afraid to go out on the streets in winter and did not
 
want to come to the Church to weave as arranged.
 She does not
 
want to start until March as her apartment is too cold.
 She
 
wants to teach only on an Eastern loom and said, with an
 
apologetic smile, that she hoped they didn't expect her to teach
 
an American apprentice.
 The organizers were happy to adjust the
 
program to
 
her needs and agreed to, with Shalom, on the spot, but the real
 
communication about the program only occured during this visit,
 
the day before  it was funded.
 She left the meeting knowing her
 
apprentice was to be her daughter-in-law, which she had not known
 
before.
 Shalom opened the eyes of the people trying to help and
 
put Bun Em center stage and in control of her apprenticeship.
 
The episode will have a lasting effect and I was impressed with
 
Shalomts sensitive understanding and being able to reshape a
 
situation which was way off the mark.
 There are plans to build 2
 
Cambodian looms for use of Bun Em and her teaching.
 
I  regret
 to say that I came down with a debilitating virus  the
 
night before the Panel meeting and was able to attend only during
 
the final hour or two.
 However,
 In that time I found the Panel
 
of  three
 people (Simon Bronner,
 Jeanette Lasansky,
 and  Roddy
 
Moore)
 probing  and  effective.
 The  grants  totaled  $21,805;
 
with  $3,150  reserved for consulting  fees,
 $1,110  for  travel
 
and  $3,000 for a conference to be held in September 1985 of  the
 
consultants, members of the applicant organizations, some masters
 
3
 
and
 apprentices
 for  evaluation.
 Apprenticeships
 for
 the
 
following  traditional
 crafts  were
 funded:
 Irish  crochet,
 
quilting,
 splint oak basketry,
 willow basketry, Hmong applique,
 
Cambodian silk weaving,
 Ukrainian embroidery,
 Ukrainian weaving
 
and  broom-making.
 Nine
 of nineteen applications were
 funded.
 
Applications  not funded were mostly for spinning and weaving
 in
 
addition  to
 the quilting ones referred to  above,
 for  reasons
 
including
 insufficient skill of masters,
 non-folk  training  of
 
master,
 availability  of classes to learn the skill.
 Some were
 
asked to resubmit, some were referred to other PCA programs and a
 
second  Ukrainian  embroiderer was not funded  simply  because  a
 
choice had to made.
 There will be some  indication of the panel's
 
reason
 for  the decisions in the notifications.
 The masters
 I
 
visited are skilled and in all ways appropriate.
 
There are several aspects of this apprenticeship program which we
 
have to bear in mind as it develops.
 (l) It operates within the
 
PCA's Craft Division which is geared to  a discipline,
 not a  FA
 
orientation.
 Within  the  PCA  there  has  been  resistance
 to
 
involvement
 in Folk Arts.
 Shalom believes the  interest in  the
 
apprenticeship  program is already beginning to reverse this  and
 
will turn i
t about.
 I heard June Arey, managing Director of PCA,
 
speak enthusiastically about Shalom's work;
 she will support the
 
refunding  of  his position with the Governor's Heritage  Affairs
 
Commission.
 So the political position of the program within PCA
 
i
s
 improved,
 but Shalom and Dick Slegesmund are working  always
 
with  a  different mind-set behind them.
 I asked Shalom
 i
f  he
 
could  work better within PCA and he said no,
 that he
 has  much
 
more freedom of operation where he  is.
 
(2)
 There
 Is  a  lack  of  knowledge
 (generally)
 within  the
 
applicant  organizations  about the nature of  FA  apprenticeship
 
goals.
 They also are thinking too narrowly about transmission of
 
just  skills -
-
 another form of classwork.
 This has come  about
 
naturally as a result of their prior work with Craft programs for
 
PCA.
 It will take some ongoing work by staff and consultants to
 
bring them to an understanding of the wider elements of tradition
 
which should also be transmitted through apprenticeship.

i
s  quite aware of this and I believe during this program year an
 
understanding will begin to evolve.

 There was not enough contact with the organizations,  masters
 
and  apprentices before applications were made
 this  year.
 The
 
plan
 to  have
 members of the Crafts Advisory  Panel
 make
 site
 
visits was not  implemented and a good deal of arranging had to be
 
done
 by  phone.
 I  am  disturbed  by  the
 fact  that
 many
 
master/a prentice
pairs  had not met and mutually worked  out  a
 
plan,  as ,core of4 mode of learning is what goes on between  these
 
two  people.
 It  i
s likely to work out alright this year  but
 I
 
felt  a  tentativeness
 in those masters who did not  know  their
 
apprentices.
 There
 will
 be  a visit
 to  each  apprenticeship
 
by  a  consultant.
 During  these
 visits  and  the
 follow-up
 
conference these subjects will surface and be addressed.

 The grant application form,
 the standard one for PCA,
 did
 
not  bring
 forth enough  specific
 information.
 Apparently
 I
t
 
cannot  be changed but guidelines can be written to accompany
 i
t
 
which  will
 elicit
 the
 facts needed in a  more  complete
 way,
 
including work plans of stages and goals.
 
I  recommend  refunding the program because a  lot  of  excellent
 
groundwork  has been laid and because the problems I mention can,
 
and  will,
 be addressed as the program  progresses.
 Shalom
 i
s
 
perceptive,
 effective  and the right person to guide the program
 
through  any  sticky wickets.
 I look forward to  seeing  what's
 
happened in the spring.

Dear 3ess:
 
Last f
all, when I h
ired on as your "student in residence", I
 
sat in on the folklore and folkmusic courses for the purpose of
 
putting together a complete set of notes--the results of which
 
you now have in your possession.
 I think that as you look them over,
 
your suspicions should be confirmed.
 IT IS A DAMNED GREAT COURSES.
'!
 
I will not start the folklore notes until... sometime.
 My
 
notes are a bit too disorganized for me to cope with at this point.
 
Philly is a great town.
 There's an historic society for
 
everything.
 For example, the "Widows and Single Womens Society of
 
Philadelphia Founded In 1885."  If you stand on a corner too  lone,
 
your
'e just liable t0  c
'e'- h
l sre  with  hrnnie . nd  he r
ierl ,
.3
r c
­

"Historical Site."
 
That's about all I have t
ime for now.
 Keep in tot.

Dear Charlotte:
 
How complicated our l
ives get, don't they?  I didn't receive
 
your letter of December 17 until a couple of weeks ago -
-
 I
'd been on a long
 
midyear vacation -
-
 and since then I
've been working out my own thoughts about
 
the situation.
 
Let me suggeslthat we simply leave matters pianistic as they are
 
for the time being.  Here is my end of the story.  I am planning to resign from
 
my current job this year, in June or else September.  I
t i
s a somewhat terrifying
 
moment for me, though I am quite sure all will be well, but I have so far found
 
it impossible to get much further with my thinking and planning than just to decide
 
the moment itself.  I don't know where I shall go or what I shall do -
-
 not in
 
any real detail.  Ultimately I will move to the west coast, I feel quite sure; but
 
for the time being, I believe I will stay right here in Washington.  My apartment is
 
comfortable and in a well cared for building, so that I can travel without worry;
 
it seems l
ikely that I will use it as a general headquarters for the next year or
 
two while I get used to my new situation and work out some more permanent plans.
 
That being the case, it is perfectly convenient for me to continuing
 
sharing my home with the piano; I will get it tuned but not refinished, play i
t
 
when I have a moment, and we can take up the whole issue again in a year or two
 
when my own plans have matured.  At that time, I can, as you suggest, either move
 
the piano with me, send it on to you or to a place you specify, or donate it to a n
 
appropriate institution.  As of now I doubt I will be moving into quarters large
 
enough for this piano, but one never knows I In the meantime, should your own plans
 
make it possible for you to reclaim the piano or if xkx you should want to give it
 
to your brother or whatever, please feel entirely free to make the arrangements.
 
You worried far too much about the movers anyway; they didn't discommode either me
 
or Nick a bit.
 
As you may know, Naomi, John and the children are now in California.
 
I visited them over Christmas and had a wonderful time.  Naomi is chair of the
 
Department of Anthropology at California State University in Northridge where I once
 
taught.  We do seem to spend so much of our l
ives going around in circles!
 
With all best wishes to you always,
 
P
.S.  Please don't hesitate to call or write if the arrangment I
'm proposing doesn't
 
suit you f
or any reason.
