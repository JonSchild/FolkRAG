Anna Molen (b. 1954, Pulaski County, KY) has been a rural letter carrier for 32 years and plans to retire 
next year. She remembers admiring the job of a rural letter carrier when she was growing up in Pulaski 
County, KY. Molen was hired by the Postal Service as a rural carrier in 1990 and had known the 
postmaster, her boss, since she was a child. She is currently on her 4th rural route. Her first has nearly 700 
boxes and was 98 miles. Her current route, which she’s been delivering for 13 years, has 600 boxes and is 
76 miles. Molen has her own organizational system for delivering the mail where she organized her route 
sequence in several storage tubs. She is the NRLCA president in her district and has been a union member 
for 26 years. She has also been a trainer of new rural letter carriers for 10-12 years. In this interview, she 
speaks about how her background in social work related to the job of rural letter carrying, her 
relationships with her customers, and the new evaluated system to determine rural letter carriers’ pay.

EH: Emily Hilliard 
AM: Anna Molen 
 
00:00 
EH: Okay, it's February 12th, 2022, and I'm in Somerset, Kentucky. Why don't you introduce yourself: 
tell me your name, the year you were born, and where you're from. 
 
AM: My name is Anna Molen. I was born in Somerset. My birthday is... 
 
EH: Just give the year. Just so your birthday won't be online. 
 
AM: Okay. Okay. I was born in 1954. I've lived in Pulaski County my whole life but several different 
places and now I'm back to living one mile from where I grew up! 
 
EH: Nice. Tell me how you got interested in becoming a rural mail carrier? 
 
AM: When I was a child, I would watch our mailman deliver mail and he had a little Volkswagen Beetle. 
I didn't know this at the time, but he would deliver one section of his route and then go back and reload. 
And I thought that was the coolest job you could ever want. I mean you're out by yourself, you meet 
people. So as I grew up, when I went to college, I was in social work. So, I applied what I learned in 
social work to meeting people. That's, you learn to open your ears and close your mouth! And just listen 
to what they tell you. 
 
EH: That's very cool. So, yeah, tell me how you first started as a mail carrier and how you learned the 
job.  
 
AM: Okay. It took me 5 years to get on at the Post Office, and I was hired in December of 1990. I went 
through my training. The postmaster, I remember him from when I was a child because he used to work 
delivering feed to the farm where I grew up. So I remembered this big barrel-chested man and I finally 
met him as an adult. The man that I worked with that trained me, he was really good. He's a jewel if you 
want to call him a jewel. I rode with him, I worked with him for 4 days to learn my route. And you take a 
notebook with you and you ask questions, write them down, whatever he tells you, because he'd been 
doing it for years! He was a cancer survivor--many different kinds of cancer, but he was so smart and 
easy to work with. He was not hateful and I took that as a clue when I trained somebody--don't be hateful! 
You know, answer their questions! There's no stupid questions because somebody's trying to learn. But I 
did my route and my first day was a nightmare. It was January 8, 1991. It poured the rain. It wasn't warm 
rain. It was a cold rain all day long. I made it back at, to the post office at about 8:30 at night. This is 
Central time. I went places that I delivered all my mail, it was a long route, it was 98 miles at that time. I 
delivered all my mail and got back to the post office. At about 5:30, the postmaster come looking for me. 
And he just come up on me because, and I lagged about 45 minutes or so, but it was raining so hard. And 
he says, "I can't see you!" And I said, "Gee, thanks John, I can't see you either." And he brought this great 
big, huge light to put on top of my vehicle. I had a little light. It was like something you put on a semi 
that's hauling something big and all you can remember hearing is the sound of the light going around, 
vibrating off your vehicle. But I got back and I was off the next day--beautiful day the next day. He said, 
the last words he says, "Are you gonna be back Saturday?" And I said "Yeah!" I said, "I don't let rain 
defeat me." So I've been in rain and snow, flooded areas, you don't go where you can't see. So, but that's 
my first day. 
 
EH: Wow! (laughs) What do you have to do to make sure the mail doesn't get wet?

04:56  
 
AM: Well, I've got the lady that--I used to be a trainer--and the lady that trained me to be a trainer, she 
learned this. They give us straps and she said, you pull it up and it can shift and you can, your elbow will 
pop and your shoulder will hurt. So she said this is what I do. And she bought this little storage tubs like 
15 quart storage boxes with lids! And my mail doesn't get wet. I've got like 25 of those with the lids and I 
put my mail in those and they've each one got a number on the end, so I keep everything in order and 
that's what I use! And I've got let's see, two other, well 2 or 3 other carriers--one regular carrier will use 
them, and the subs.  And your mail doesn't get wet. If you take it out, you can cover parcels and things but 
you can't replace wet mail. So my mail stays dry. 
 
EH: Tell me about your route--your first route--how long it was and how many boxes and then how it's 
changed since? 
 
AM: Ooo, I don't even remember how many boxes. Close to over 700 boxes and it was 98 miles. My next 
route was when I, that was the part-time one. When I went full-time it was a short route, but it was all city 
and it was over 700 boxes. I've been on 4 routes, so the third route was about 75 or 6 miles and it had 650 
boxes. And now I'm on my fourth route. And it's 76 miles and I have right at 600 boxes. So, I know about 
mmm, 40,000 names! (laughs) In my head. Carriers that have worked after me will come up with a name 
on a piece of mail and they'll say, "Hey Ann, where's this go?" And I tell them. I go, "Let me think of it a 
minute," and it'll come to me!  
 
EH: That's amazing. Do you have the order, the addresses on your route memorized? 
 
07:19  
 
AM: Yeah. I do. And names. Names that go with the numbers. 
 
EH: Can you recite some of the numbers in order? 
 
AM: In order? 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
AM: Oh this is fun. I have a road called Half-Acre. That's always funny because the guy before me called 
it "hufaker". And it starts at 137. No it starts at 52 and you go all away around and the last number is 
1650. 1659. But it goes in and out and I go down roads called Chatty Mann Road, Betty Mann Road, and 
this was actual people. And Bettymann lives on Betty Mann Road! But Chatty Mann must have been her 
father or something, I'm not sure, but he's got a road after him! And one of the clerks the other day was 
sorting packages and she goes, "Chatty Mann Road, is that such a thing?" I said, "Yep! Over here!" and 
"It's mine!" But I go down, I go in and out, it's like one road, two, three offshoots off of that road. And it'll 
take about 35 minutes to do that little section, but it all adds up.  
 
EH: Yeah, how long does the entire route take? 
 
AM: Oh, when you have to take a boxholder and depending on how many packages you have to deliver, 
it can run 6 and a half hours. Maybe longer. So you gotta know, you have to get out [of the post office] or 
you don't get back. You can't get out at 10 o'clock in the morning and expect to get back if you've got all 
that stuff. So you have to go through it and you pick up speed as you know the numbers. Because you can

Interview with Anna Molen – 2/12/2022

recognize the name before you recognize the number sometimes. But it's, I love it. I've been doing it for 
32 years now.  
 
EH: And how long have you been on this current route? 
 
AM: Oh, about 13 years. It'll be 14 years I think in July. 
 
EH: Why don't you tell me about the customers and what the populations you serve are? 
 
09:43  
 
AM: Well, I don't have any rich people. They might be rich in land and stuff but they're not high-falutin' 
as the saying would go. Most of 'em are middle income. I have low income. I've got people that have 
money but no big fancy houses. They work. Just about everybody works. It runs the whole line of people 
with money that are established to people that are just getting established. Like I said, I think most 
everybody works. We have very few of what you would consider the poverty level where they can't work 
and they draw, because I don't have that many checks, thank goodness. But I like people to work! I 
worked my whole life so. 
 
EH: Yeah, tell me about some of the relationships you've formed with your customers over the years. 
 
AM: Well, we're on a first name basis and they wave. When it's bad weather, they don't get out and you 
know it! I've got people that can't really get out and move around but they'll be sitting on the porch and 
they'll wave at you and talk to you and you can sit and talk to 'em for 5 minutes and it's all getting along 
with the community and you're promoting the Postal Service. And I've got a lot of people that they know 
me away from the Post Office too. They see me and I remember one woman, I saw her in a doctor's office 
one time and I called her by name and said, "Hi, how are you," and she looked at me like "Who are you?" 
And I said, "I'm your mail lady!" She goes--she was about 5 foot tall--she just looks up, she goes, "You're 
bigger than I thought you was!" 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
AM: But I have old people and I take care with my older people because I will make the extra effort to if I 
take a package to the house, I take their mail with it. And I'll knock on the door and hand it to 'em and I'll 
say this just saves you a trip out in this bad weather, which it's just being nice to people. And what you 
give you, you will get back. I was trying to think of some of the others. I have a lot of people that work 
and they don't want their packages sitting on the front porch. So we can bag 'em, we have the clear plastic 
bags, especially for bad weather, set them in behind on the back porch--that's where they request you put 
it, or "put it in that car in the driveway. It's unlocked, so they don't get wet!" It's all a matter of taking care 
of people's, I call it property. 
 
12:57  
 
EH: Tell me, have customers left you gifts? Do they leave you money, food, etc.? 
 
AM: Jars of jelly, homemade candy or bought candy or a 10 dollar gift card at Christmas, and it just says, 
"Thank you for being such a nice mail lady. This is a little something for you." So yeah! I haven't gotten 
anything major ever. They told us to start with, if they give you 20 dollars, you have to bring it back into 
the Post Office and I said, "They didn't give it to the Post Office! I work and I work hard and I take care 
of their stuff." And that's just, the prices being what they are, that doesn't buy anything. Twenty dollars,

so. It's just nice to know that they remember you and they'll put it in a Christmas card, you know, thank 
you for your service and stuff. 
 
EH: What kind of homemade candies? 
 
AM: Oh, I've got some that make it almost as good as my mother did. The lady that runs the pharmacy, 
her mother makes it and she gives it to me and it's like peanut butter and chocolate. I've had peanut brittle, 
what else? Cookies, different people give different things like that. Some of the candies are good, but 
some of 'em, not so good. That's the difference in cooks! 
 
EH: And what about the jellies? 
 
AM: It's just homemade jelly. What did I get this last time? Oh I got a quart jar of honey, I think it was 
raspberry jelly this time. It's in my refrigerator at home. I was trying to think what else did they give me? 
It's just small things. Somebody gave me something last year that was a bar of soap, scented soap, or 
something. It didn't smell good! (laughs) But it's still there in my house! But you take things in like that. 
You carry it in and you put it up and then you think back, wow, so and so gave me this. And I keep cards. 
Christmas cards, and a year later I'll go through them, I thought, oh, okay, I know what this was from.  
 
EH: Why don't you walk me through your day from when you get to the post office to when you get back 
home. 
 
AM: Okay. I get to the post office, clock in at 6:15 in the morning. I proceed to go through my parcels 
and empty my hamper out so that they can throw more parcels in, but I separate front of the route from 
the back of the route, keep them separated. Then I start sorting mail. I get my flats, you always put the big 
things up first, get your flats, put them up. That's magazines, newspapers, things like that. And then I got 
trays of letters. And sometimes I got 2 trays and sometimes I got 4 trays because I can be, 450 letters in a 
tray. So that's a lot of letters to go through. And I do sort my mail. I don't just take it to the street because 
I would be bringing back so much that goes to other post offices and stuff. So I go ahead and I separate 
my mail, sort it, put it up in the case, and we have cases that have been there for 50 years. They're metal. 
They've got metal dividers, the whole 9. They were the original cases. After you get all those sorted and 
put up, then you mark your packages, big markers for big packages, little markers for little packages. Get 
all those sorted and then you have to go and check your accountable mail which is like certifieds and 
anything that requires a signature--that's accountable mail. Write those up and you put 'em in the case. 
Then you take your mail that's not yours to a throwback case and sort it. Then you proceed to down case. 
We upcase to start and then we downcase. And it's like you put it in a certain order as you're sorting it 
which is the top of the carousel, and it goes around the case like a carousel. And then when you downcase 
it, you start at the very last box and put it in first and you just, I was so confused when I first started, 
"Why are you doing this?" And he goes, "Just watch. Just go ahead and do it." And he said, "I'll explain to 
you when we start delivering it." When you downcase, you start at the end of the route and put everything 
in order going backwards. And when you get to the end of that, you're at your first box that you delivered 
to, and it's like, I did training for about 10 years, 12 years, and it's the hardest thing to get a new trainee to 
understand that because they always want to take the first box down, put it in first, but it would be 
backwards. Then I load my vehicle up, I have a Jeep. I've had right hand Jeeps, oh for about 10 years 
now. And they're a blessing. It's easier on your hips, trust me. Load it up, put your parcels in and you load 
everything. My tubs that I sort my mail into are numbered on the end and the first one that I put in is 
number one, which means that's the last one that I'm gonna put out, deliver. Load your vehicle up, take 
your hamper back in, put it up, then you clock out to the route. We have the scanners, new scanners now 
that you clock in and clock out. Everything is going to be by the scanners anymore, in the near future. I 
told my sub yesterday, he asked me, he says, "This remapping we're doing," he says, "What is it gonna 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Anna Molen – 2/12/2022

do? How's it going to affect us?" And I said, "It's going to affect your paycheck." And I said "There's not 
going to be any corners to cut. You have to do everything the right way. You can't skip, say you've gotta 
go down a road and you can see the mailbox and there's only one mailbox there, and you can see that the 
flag is down, it's not up, you still have to go to it and stop at the box, turn around and come back out." 
Because it keeps track of your mileage. If you get out of your vehicle to set a package on the porch or 
whatever, it's measured. We're supposed to be getting paid by footage now, how much we walk, but you 
have to do that. When you sign out to go out to the route, bathroom, the last thing you do before you 
leave, you go to the bathroom 'cause there's no port-a-potties out on the route. And then you proceed to 
leave the post office. Sign out, and you're gone. And you go to your first box and then you just keep 
going. And it's like learning by memory, like by rote, everything. You stop and I guarantee, everybody 
does it, if you have a package, or not a package, but mail that you have to stop at that box 364 days a year, 
you will stop. The one day a year that they don't get any mail, you will still stop because you're so used to 
stopping there (laughs).  
 
But you go and you deliver your mail. My route is divided like 2/3 on the front part and a third on the last 
part. By the time I get back to the doctor's office, it's right at 2/3rds of my route. I get my dismount, I've 
carried the mail in, a pharmacy, doctor's offices, and then I come back out, I go to the bathroom, go to the 
restroom, and then I'm back in my vehicle again for another two and a half hours. Then I get back to the 
post office and unload my tubs and any parcels that come back in where people are sending them out. We 
always have to scan those too. And deposit everything where it goes, and put up any mail that's been 
sorted to your route that day while you were gone, put it up, making sure all your equipment's put away 
and then you clock out and you got home. It can vary in days from, let's see 7 and a half hours up to ten 
hours because somebody said what time do you leave? And the answer everybody gives is "When I get 
done."  
 
22:27  
 
EH: Do you think the new system will make your paycheck go up or down? 
 
AM: I think mine will go up. But everybody else is saying, "Oh no! We're gonna go down!" But no, I 
don't think so. You do the same thing every day if you go by the rules, you are doing it with the scanners 
and if you're doing it right, it's not gonna go down. It will go up. Basically, my last mail count was before 
we got Amazon, so that's been 4 years, 5 years, and my route went up then! But with those you have to 
keep your edit books, which is what we're gonna do when we map, is by the edit books. And as long as 
you have those up to date, if you get a new box, you put it in the book. If somebody's gone over 90 days, 
then you list it as vacant, but it evens out. It won't be plus and minus. And I carried, I was up 46K and I 
carried 20 minutes for my next hour to go up for 4 or 5 years, simply because I was putting new boxes in 
but I would list other boxes as vacant, so you don't get paid for a vacant box. And it kept it even. It didn't 
change. But it will change now, simply because Amazon will do it, I believe because there's so many 
packages. And we're gonna have a lot of footage if they actually pay us for footage. I told somebody, I 
said, I'll believe it when I see it. We heard that before when we got the scanners, "Oh, it..." They never 
paid us before by footage. I think it will make up a difference. I don't think I will go down. 
 
EH: Do you ever track how many steps you take for your job? 
 
AM: (laughs) I'm too busy looking out for stuff not to step in when I go to a house. Especially if they 
have dogs. You don't like to step into something and you get into your vehicle and you sit down and you 
think, "What am I smelling?" Because you have to get out and clean your shoes as best as you can. But I 
always watch. And see everybody doesn't have sidewalks, so you have to walk across a yard.

EH: But I mean like with a step counter on your phone or anything? 
 
AM: No. I don't do that. That's their job. The scanners are supposed to count the distance. It measures the 
points from point A to point B and when we remap it's doing it by satellite. The picture's coming down 
from the top and we're just having to mark where we stop at the box, where do we stop in the driveway, 
where's our delivery point, and that's a few things. I'm doing my mapping this Tuesday. I was one of the 
first ones that did it and got finished with it 6 years ago. But we've been working on it since and now 
they've got a whole new system! 
 
EH: So it's not actually tracking your steps, it's the line between A and B. Yeah. 
 
AM: You might take, if you're tall and long-legged, you might take 10 steps because your steps are 
longer, and it might take me 12, 13, 14. I've got long legs, but still! And you're carrying something. Then 
you have to set it down and scan it. You're not getting paid this time. You're scanning it and you're 
entering it in the scanner, and then you turn around and you walk straight back to your vehicle. So it's 
supposed to give you the distance between your vehicle and your delivery point and it multiplies it by 2 to 
get your supposedly exact footage. I'm not going to say mileage, it's footage.  
 
EH: Yeah. When you were training people, what were things you made sure to tell them about the job? 
 
26:38  
 
AM: It's not easy. You will be slow to start. But as you learn your route and you keep doing it and you get 
more accurate, you will get faster. Accuracy breeds speed. It's just a natural thing. The lady that trained 
me to be a trainer, she was really good. I lost my train of thought. She showed me things to do and we had 
a thing that I passed out, other trainers, other people, always ask if you don't know how to do something, 
ask! Like I said, there's no stupid questions--ask! Somebody has been on that route before you and that's 
the way to find out.  
 
EH: What do you think the importance of your work is to the community you serve? 
 
AM: Sometimes I'm the only person they see every day. And I always smile and wave. It doesn't matter 
how bad you feel or what kind of day you've had. They don't know. They wave at you, you wave back 
and smile and say how are you and things because you're promoting the post office too. They say, "Oh 
my carrier is so nice!" I've heard that I don't know how many times, from other people that they talk to 
because you know these other people may have a bad one, but the person on my route says, she is so nice! 
And I try to be nice because what you give out's gonna come back to you.  
 
EH: Have you ever had instances where you had to rely on your customers--in bad weather or something 
like that? 
 
AM: Oh yeah! I've been stuck one time. And it was ice and I pulled over. I didn't think I was off the road 
but when I turned my steering wheel to pull away from the box, it slid off the edge of the road. And I had 
to call my postmaster and I said give me, look up this phone number and give me his phone number. And 
I mean he lived a mile from where I was at. And his wife answered. "Just who are you?" And I told her 
and I said, "Would you tell Stan, if he could, to come bring his tractor and pull me out because I'm stuck 
up here and slid off the edge." The front tire was what slid off, and it's icy and it wouldn't come back on. 
And I was afraid I was going to take a mailbox out. So he come up there and he couldn't get a hold of the 
front end because my Jeep has hooks that you can hook onto, it's for the frame. I said, well there's a hook 
on the backside. I said I'll straighten my tires out, and I said you pull and I'll hold that steady, and it won't

turn that wheel! And he pulled me out the back. So I went on, I thanked him, I said, "Thank you so 
much!" And the next day, he had scraped that road. It's like a mile, 2 miles, a little over a mile in and back 
out and he had scraped all those roads. He had his blade on his tractor and scraped them for me. 
 
EH: Wow. 
 
AM: It was so nice. 
 
30:17  
 
EH: Have you had other instances where you had safety concerns, weather or otherwise, when you were 
out? 
 
AM: Well, we go by the saying if it's icy and you don't think you can get through it, don't go. It's a safety 
matter, don't put your life in danger. Because I've got some roads that I'm not going down. It's over a hill 
and you go about a hundred feet and then you do a 90 degree turn and then you go another 50 or 75 feet 
and do another 90 degree turn to the right. I went over it one day and probably shouldn't have but I was 
sliding and when I got stopped, I thought, what am I gonna do? So I pull my Jeep down in Bulldog where 
it just creeps and just let it do itself. You don't hit the brakes. And I got over that hill and I said, "Not 
doing that again! No way!" But I have to go through creeks, sometimes there are flooded creeks and I 
don't go through 'em. Because you're riding on pontoons. You've got 4 inflated tires and they can pick you 
up and just put you down the creek. And I'm not doing it! 
 
EH: Let's see, what do you enjoy the most about your job? 
 
AM: Meeting people. Social work again! Just meeting people. I'm a people person. I'm a book worm, but 
I'm a people person too. 
 
EH: Yeah, tell me more about the intersection between social work and being a rural carrier? 
 
AM: Social work teaches you to listen to what somebody says. Don't put what you think, don't interject it 
into something. Let them talk. Sometimes like I said, I'm the only person they see? Let 'em talk! Because, 
well my dad, he's 91 and I can tell when somebody has been there and talked to him and let him talked 
and listened and visit, because we're scared he's going to get COVID from somebody, but he's had his 
shots, he even had double pneumonia but no sign of COVID. Just visit with people. Talk to 'em! I had one 
little woman, I mean she passed on, she was 90, she was my dad's age and they had to put her in a nursing 
home, well she passed away in the nursing home a couple years ago, she would say, "Why don't you get 
out and come over here and sit down and talk to me!" And I said, "Hon, I would but I gotta be back by 4 
o'clock." And I would talk to her all the time. And she was a sweet little woman. And I mean, you think 
older people kinda lose it mentally? Not her. She knew who you was. And she knows my name because 
the first thing they'll do is, "What's your name?" And I just tell them my first name. Unless they ask my 
last name, I just tell them my first name. And I said if you need me to bring something, stamps for you or 
something, you call the post office and tell them to tell Ann to bring you some stamps. And I'll do it! So 
there's no problem.

EH: How has your work changed since you first started in 1990?

Interview with Anna Molen – 2/12/2022

AM: Well, different routes have different problems. They say the volume's down, it's not. It's a little more 
complicated in how to deliver it, the things you have to do, when they started doing the computer things, 
that throwed, we had these old carriers there that didn't know computers or anything and they just didn't 
like those scanners! But it is what it is, that's part of the job. 
 
EH: What are some unusual things you've delivered? 
 
AM: We deliver 50 pound bags of dog food, chickens, meal worms, exotic fish, purified sand--I have one 
customer that that's his hobby. He has his basement is finished and he has shelving units and aquariums. 
It's like rows of them for exotic fish. I've delivered a table saw that weighed mmm...right at 60 pounds. 
And the guy's neighbor was one of the carriers, he said, "Oh well he'll be there. He'll help ya." No! 
(laughs) Nobody was there. But I had a pickup and I got it scooted to the tailgate and I stood there and 
looked at it and I thought okay. I let it slide down, held onto it, and slid it and then I walked it on the end, 
walked it to the door and just set it down in front of the door. And people don't know. Because I had to 
have help loading it. It was in my car and I could not pick it up by myself. That's the heaviest thing I've 
had, but it's just, whatever somebody can think of to order, we have delivered it.  
 
EH: How are exotic fish packaged? 
 
AM: Well they come in from other countries and they're kept at the customs--they have to make it 
through customs. They're in boxes of water. They're bagged. Sometimes they're live and sometimes 
they're not. It doesn't cost 'em a lot. But I've delivered one time during the mail count I had like 18 boxes-
-exotic fish, plants, things for the aquarium. They've decided they go and get their shelving units. They 
don't have them delivered through the mail, thank God because those things weight a ton. But that's his 
hobby! I mean he can't work, he's retired, he has COPD so when he goes downstairs, he stays downstairs 
and deals with his fish. And then he's decided he's going to learn to cook, so he started ordering 
cookbooks (laughs). So I was delivering exotic fish and cookbooks to the same address, and they said, "Is 
he frying the fish?" No! Because people can see what I have. 
 
EH: Right!  
 
AM: But somedays he'll get 9 or 10 packages. And they're bigger boxes. They're not little packages--
they're bigger boxes. And when they're water, they weigh more. What really gets us is people ordering 
things that come in gallons or 5 gallon things and they're in a box and when you pick them up it shifts 
because water shifts. Or cat litter--I hate cat litter. They'll take 2 of those 20-some pound boxes, almost 50 
pounds in a box. Those things are heavy! I'd rather lift 50 pounds of dog food because I have to pick up 
cat food, comes in the same way. I do 30 pound bags of cat food for my dad, so you just pick it up and 
you put it up here on your shoulder, cat food because it'll kind of curve, and carry it in. That's the only 
way you can do it. 
 
EH: So you must learn a lot about people delivering their mail. 
 
AM: Yeah! But you can't talk about it. I mean you don't even talk about it to the other carriers. It's just 
something you can laugh about something but you don't talk about it. You don't talk about people's mail, 
what's in the mail. I don't care who's gone to jail and who's got this and everything. Because I've got 
people that get letters from the state police and all this. Wow. And go on. Deliver the mail--that's your 
job. 
 
EH: So what are the stories, when you get together with other rural carriers, what kind of stories do you 
tell to each other about your jobs? 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Anna Molen – 2/12/2022 
11 
 
 
AM: We can talk about things we've delivered, but you don't name names, because it's none of their 
business. And unless they've been on the route before you and know these people, now you can have a 
good laugh if somebody's been on the route before you and then talk about it and say, "Well they did this 
when I had them." But you don't talk about it to other people. It's like you sign an agreement and it's a 
confidentiality agreement when you start. And if you break that and they complain, your job's out the 
window. You lose it! It's like working in a bank. You can't talk about so and so's got so much money in 
their account. Well, I didn't know that, you can't talk about it. It's none of your business. 
 
39:54  
 
EH: That's another way it's like social work.  
 
AM: Yeah! What you hear stays in your head. You can write it down if you're making a report because 
that reports only gonna be seen by a court or your supervisor and that's it.  
 
EH: What about like language, jokes, are there words for things that are used between carriers or in your 
work that the general public doesn't know? 
 
AM: (laughs) We've got abbreviations for about everything in the post office. Like an NDCBU. You 
wouldn't have any idea what that is. 
 
EH: No. 
 
AM: Neighborhood Distribution Collection Box Unit. NDCBU. Things like that. We've got the big cage 
things like they bring the mail in, NDCBU is what you would see in front of apartments where everyone 
has one, they have a key and open it. I thought I explained that one. But it's just--they want to abbreviate 
everything and then you think, what? And then somebody says, oh you know that's so and so.  
 
EH: What is the most challenging part of your job? 
 
AM: Getting back to the post office in once piece. And you've got all your mail delivered. 
 
EH: So just getting it all done every day. 
 
AM: Getting it all done. It may take you 7 hours one day and 10 hours the next day. It just depends on 
what you get. It's never the same thing every day.  
 
EH: Tell me about the union and your roll in it and what it does for you as a worker? 
 
AM: Okay. I've been in the union for probably 26 years. I went and joined it right before, about 3 years 
in. I'm the president in my district. I'm a steward so I have to know, if people want to file a grievance, I 
have to know how to do it. I get training for that. We make sure that people can work with no harassment. 
If people start picking on people, we do the grievances. I would rather get something settled before they 
want to file a grievance, but I will file a grievance! I've really, I've never had to file a grievance because 
we can get it worked out before that. It makes sure that you are getting paid what you're supposed to get 
paid. It's like us against the big guy, but it's not really. They expect you to do your job and most 
everything, but you have a few people that will come in and want to ride herd on everybody else and 
sometimes it don't work! I'm not even gonna say that one!

Like I said, I'm the president in this district. I'm over a huge area. Basically all the way across the bottom 
of the state from Clinton County to Harlan County and then I'm District H, but I've got Harlan, 
Kentucky's in mine. Middlesboro, Pineville, Pikeville's in a different district. But all the way through 
there. It's a lot of people and I get phone calls all the time. I got a phone call, I was standing in a store the 
other day and my phone rang and I thought, well that's a pretty local number so I went ahead and 
answered it. I didn't have who it was from, it said it was a valid number, and it was a lady up here at 
Somerset! And she was asking me questions and I said, "Hon, I can't tell you what it is," I said, "But you 
need to talk to your steward." I said, "I know Rick was the steward before and he's not doing it now, but 
he can tell you who your steward is." It was something to do with COVID and how she was going to get 
paid. Or, but you have to know how to talk to them, how to refer them to people that can help them. I 
cannot go as a steward from my post office to the Jamestown Post Office, which is just 6 miles away, and 
do anything in that post office because you're not allowed to. An area steward can--you can call them, I've 
got their numbers if I've got a question that I can't find an answer to, I'll call them! That's what they're 
there for. But it's all working together. The union supports the carriers. We don't support management. So 
if management's trying to get by with something they're not supposed to and it's causing a problem, the 
union can come in and we file grievances and get this settled before it gets out of hand. So that's basically 
about everything. See I'm planning to retire next year and somebody's gonna have to do it from the post 
office! My sub asked me yesterday or the day before, he said, just what exactly do I need to do to know 
more about what the union does and how to get into it, because he just joined the union and he's been 
there mmm almost a year. But he's got his 90 days in, he's got, because I had surgery, he's got his 90 days 
in. And I said, go to the meetings, listen, ask questions, if you don't understand something ask questions. 
There's no stupid questions if you're trying to find out something! But I like the union and I wouldn't have 
joined it if I didn't approve of it.  
 
EH: Yeah. Why don't you describe the area, the community, you know the landscape on your route? 
 
AM: I'm more rural. The only in-town thing I have is the doctor's offices. And then I'm on the road again. 
It's rough! I mean I've got some steep roads to go up and down and there are bad roads in the winter, I 
don't and I have to do a deviation and go around from the other side as far as I can go. The one hill where 
I told you it was 90 degree turns? You don't go down it if it's bad. Ever. Because up here, there's a hill on 
one side, and here's your road, and over here it goes down this way, so you do not want to go off that hill. 
It's just, it's dangerous. Most of the time people drive normally, carefully. Other times there's people will 
just about run you off the road. Mostly it's farm community, farming areas. I've got a few businesses like 
the garages and stuff like that. But if you need help, I think I could ask anybody out there. The last snow 
we had that was bad, I had to turn around. I mean I went as far as I could go and I delivered my last big 
packages and I turned around and I was going like 10 miles an hour maybe? I couldn't keep the snow off 
my windshield. My wiper blades, I'd have to stop and bang the snow off of them because it was wet snow 
and it was packing, and it wasn't clearing my windshield. I got back out to the main road, I called the 
postmaster and I said, I'm coming in! "Well did you get Damron Creek?" And I said, "No!" I said, "I 
couldn't even see Damron Creek!" I couldn't see 10 feet in front of me, so. But the next morning when I 
left the post office, I told him, I said, I'm going to go up and get that area first because they didn't get their 
mail yesterday. If I can get through, and I did the Damron Creek part first and then because I'd have to go 
over hill on that side too. The creek is down at the bottom of the hill and you have to cross it. But you 
couldn't cross it because it was so high. He says that's fine. Don't deviate you know, unless you have to 
and like I got his permission to do it that way. Don't take it on your own to do it because they'll say, no 
you're not allowed to do that. But you can if he gives you permission. Always ask permission. Better to 
do that than to get fussed at and everything else and you know, it doesn't matter if it's because of safety. 
Like I said, most of mine is farming community.

EH: And how has the area changed since you've started, if it's changed? 
 
AM: New houses.  
 
AM: New houses. I don't have, I've only got like 2-3 what you call subdivisions and they're just little 
subdivisions--8 or 10 houses around a curve and stuff. I don't have any of the big subdivisions, but new 
houses are going up all the time. I've just put in 3 new boxes in the last month, I've added to my edit book. 
I don't have any vacant right now that I've put in. I've got people that go south for the winter and they've 
got a come-back date so I don't count them as vacant because I'm forwarding their mail and then it stops. 
But I don't have that many snowbirds on this route--we call them snowbirds. I was trying to think of 
anything else that's changing. I noticed yesterday they're already putting a road in, it's a big field where I 
come back down a road and then turn and go off down another road. They were putting a road in there, I 
said, "Okay, we're gonna have some houses!" (laughs) 
 
EH: (laughs) Yeah. 
 
AM: Which is good! You get paid per house, per box, so much time, so many boxes. Everything that I 
don't guess people know what a mail count is. But everything is counted. Your boxes, your stops on the 
route, and you get so much per that, and then you get a volume count where they count every piece of 
mail. Every piece of mail from the little bitty post card to the big catalogs, everything is counted. Then 
you get that total count and how many miles you got, how many boxes you got and everything. It all 
works out. They had a formula. I saw the formula one day, I couldn't do it. I'm math and science and 
social work, I couldn't do it. It doesn't make any sense to me, but they determined what the route is. But 
the more boxes you have, the higher your route's gonna go. You get so much time for every box but then 
your time doesn't go up until you get 20 boxes, I think it is. It's like 3 minutes a box with the volume and 
the box and then 20 boxes will make an hour, so you have to go like 5 boxes over that. And then your 
route will change and go up an hour.  
 
EH: Mmhm. 
 
AM: And that's good because I'm just at a 44 now. So I'm doing good.  
 
EH: What do you hope for the future of the craft? 
 
AM: I don't see any big changes because we have to deliver the mail and we're not gonna be doing that by 
any other way except personally. Because it just doesn't happen and it won't happen. Because there's too 
many place that we go where nobody else goes. I always told them, one thing I told them when I was 
training is, it's not just a job, it's an adventure. And if you look at it that way, you won't get scared. We've 
had, I've had some that they were, when I was training, they were just so gung ho, "Yeah, I'm gonna do 
this, I'm gonna do this." They get out and they didn't make it a day. Or when she got to the post office, 
this one girl in Monticello--I call her girl. She's younger than me! I'm 67 so everybody's younger than me. 
She was really into it and when she got out there and she saw the actual work, she rode with her carrier 
the 2 days and then you do like half days, you take the first half of the route 2 days, then you go 2 days 
and do the back half of the route, and then you do one day. Make sure you get it all together. And then 
you've got your carrier there. We go in and train, you know, I'm there until I'm sure that my sub can do it 
and that's something I do for them. They're not paying me to do that! But that's part of my job is to make 
sure they're trained. It's not always good. We've had some that just couldn't do it and they don't last. 
Unfortunately. They've got good intentions but the actual work scares them.

EH: Yeah. Is there anything else you'd like to share that we haven't talked about? 
 
AM: I've seen the Post Office change from the time I was a child. Like I said, I thought that was the 
greatest job in the world, and now I'm doing it! It doesn't matter how much I have to do--I'm still doing it. 
I enjoy it. I enjoy the people. I can talk to anything about anything. It doesn't matter if you're a child to a 
senior citizens. The kids are wonderful. They will climb up on your running board and ask you "How can 
you drive from that side?" I say, "Oh this is easy." Or they'll get on the other side and say, "Where's your 
steering wheel?" That was the funniest thing. "Where's your steering wheel?" I said, well it's over here! 
"Well how do you get the gas pedals?" I said, "They're right down there." And they don't believe me and 
so I just open up the door and got my foot on the brake and show them! (gasps) And that's just, you can 
just see their eyes get so big. They never see a right-hand drive. And they're so funny. And older people 
says, "How you doing that?" (laughs) You never get old. You always are curious. If you get old you 
might, and stop being curious about anything, whelp there's your casket!  
 
EH: Yeah, yeah. 
 
AM: That's about everything I can remember being a child and watching the mail and thinking, oh that's 
gotta be a cool job. I'd love to do that. Then when I finally decided to do it, it took me 5 years to get 
hired.  
 
EH: Why is that? 
 
56:07  
 
AM: I was interviewed here in Somerset first and the guy said, well you'll have to deliver out towards 
Shopville and stuff, and says, "These big coal trucks may pass you, what are you gonna do?" And I said, 
"I'm gonna sit still and let 'em pass me." If I'm at a box. Well he didn't think I could do it, and then I had 
to wait a couple more years and they called me from Russell Springs. Went for an interview and got hired 
that day. So, it's just the guy at Somerset had a thing about female carriers. That's the only thing I could 
go by. And 'cause he didn't have any female carriers. I'm the first female sub, RCA, and then I was the 
first female carrier in the whole county, and it was just like, "Can you do this?" I did it.  
 
EH: (laughs) 1990, you would think they would be a little more... 
 
AM: But they weren't. They weren't. 
 
EH: Yeah. Are you gonna be involved in some way still with the union when you retire? 
 
AM: Well, we're supposed to have our meeting in 2 months and I told them that I'm trying to back out of 
it some, let somebody else be the president. I mean I'll go for secretary/treasurer. And the one woman 
that's my secretary now, she wants to get out of it. She wants to go to either vice president or president. I 
said, you go for it. I'll be there to help you, whatever. I said, I am gonna keep my hand in it because I 
enjoy it! I like going to the meetings, I like hearing the national officers talk, see what's going on 
somewhere else, if it might work better here, you just never know. But as long as I'm healthy and able to 
work I said I was gonna work. Well, I've got an artificial knee now and I had a hysterectomy and it's just 
age and wear and tear. I'm getting tired. By next year I'll have everything paid off and then, I'm already 
drawing Social Security. I'll have my pension, my Social Security, and my thrift savings. 
 
EH: Nice!

AM: And I won't have to worry about paying bills. My house is paid off. The insurance covered that part. 
I had a house fire so the insurance paid for the double wide.  
 
EH: Oh wow. 
 
AM: I don't owe nothing for that. But I'll be covered everywhere else! And I'll be able to do what I want 
to do. I said I didn't want to retire before because I get bored. I learned that sitting at home with this knee 
for 9 weeks. I get bored easy. You can only play so many games on a computer and read so many books. I 
read books like crazy. And getting out and seeing people. I miss that about as much as anything. But I 
can't be a sub after I retire, but I can be in the union and help. 
 
EH: You can't be a sub after you retire? They don't allow you? 
 
AM: Well a sub doesn't put anything into their pension or anything like that. You pay Social Security tax 
in, but you're not--you can be in the union as a sub, but you're not paying into your retirement, so I don't 
think I could do that. I wouldn't mind trying it, but you keep out of it. I said I'm gonna sell both of my 
Jeeps and when I retire. 
 
EH: Do you have 2 right-side drive Jeeps? 
 
AM: Yeah, I do. I have a 2010 and a 2015. My son told me the other day, he says, "Mom I have an offer 
to go to South Carolina and work!" And I said, "You ain't taking my car!" I said, "You might take that red 
Jeep and drive it since I finally got it fixed, but you ain't taking my car." Because I just got my car paid 
off. I have a Hyundai Santa Fe and he's driving it. I want the car back! (laughs) But I mean I enjoy being a 
carrier and it's just I like to meet people, I like to talk to people. I'm my parents' child. They both don't 
know a stranger. They could talk to somebody on the phone with a wrong number for an hour. My mom 
is passed away 12 years ago, almost 13 years ago at the end of this month and my dad is still alive. Take 
care of him. When I left home, I went out and fed his cats and also, he doesn't go out in this cold air. He 
told me he was gonna take a walk yesterday afternoon, he said, "I got about 3 steps out the door, turn 
around and come back." And I said, "Good! You didn't need to be out in that wind." I'm just, I'm bossy 
towards him sometimes, and I said "Don't get out. Cover your head." Yeah. He's a farmer! But he's 91 
years old and I don't want him sick. We want him around a few more years anyway. 
 
EH: Yeah! Well thank you so much for your time and sharing all this with me. 
 
AM: You're welcome! I was gonna go talk to you last week after Jason did and he said, "Oh no, she left." 
I said, "I thought I was gonna talk to her!"  
 
EH: Yeah, I went back, came back for the meeting. 
 
AM: Yeah. I was gonna get it done last weekend! 
 
EH: (laughs) Sorry! 
 
AM: That's fine! That's fine.  
 
EH: Well I'll stop this here.
