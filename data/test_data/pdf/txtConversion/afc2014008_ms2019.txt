those under forty-five than those over the median years.  We like to encourage
 
our young people.
 
How d
oes it happen, then, that in the Heritage Fellowships there has been
 
such a concentration on older artists?  To repeat, it was not planned but there does
 
seem to be an especially close relationship between the folk arts and the elderly,
 
so much so that I believe that, even if the Folk Arts panel had tried to come up
 
with a more equitable age distribution, they would have found it an awfully
 
difficult feat to bring off.
 The reasons are many, having to do both with the
 
nature of folk arts and the nature of the general human life cycle.  Let us take
 
up first the nature of the folk arts.
 
As we note in the Folk Arts Program guidelines, "the folk and traditional
 
arts have grown through time within the many groups that make up any nation -
-
groups that share the same ethnic heritage, language, occupation, religion, or
 
geographic area "  They are the "homegrown, traditional artistic activities of
 
such groups
 and they serve both to identify and to symbolize the group that
 
originated them "  A list of examples might include, Samoan story telling, Ozark
 
ballads, Irish step dances, Southeast Asian embroidery.  Almost always, these art
 
forms have been learned informally, by casual or not-so-casual observation, or
 
by being "shown," often a relatively brief experience.
 On the whole, one does not
 
go to Julliard to learn how to play a hammer dulcimer, nor are there many courses
 
available, even in our technical schools, in how to build an Eskimo skin boat.
 
American society does not ordinarily place much stock in informal learning.
 
We l
ike to be professional and efficient; the notion that an artistic activity or
 
s
tyle might be absorbed simply by a process of hanging about and observing sits
 
to he conveyed
 
un easily with our feeling that the  reall
y important t
hings ought
  
a really important (and thus formalized) manner.
 
Just a bit of reflection, though, impresses upon one the universality of
 
those early childhood exp eriences
 when
 one drifted off to sleep to the strains
 o
f  
r
i
thvr'
 practicing waltzes, or the family's
 favorite gospil hear on
 
A
.
  
3
 
the radio, or the matachi e society next door getting ready for the f
iesta toulorruw.
 
In the visual dimension, as the child watches the swift fingers of a basket maker
 
selecting and rejecting grass stems, or sees the seamstress making the vital dcci  ins
 
between contrast or complementaritY in color, or absorbs, just by living  with i
t,
 
the spare dignity of furniture built in the Shaker style, an equal number of elc y  t
 
distinctions are being learned, even though not taught.  Each one of us
 
within an aesthetic environment that helps us identify and express from o
 
come, whether or not we practice or personally participate in the local art for:
 
Thus we come to know early on whether our folks like to worship God witk L
i
 
massed choirs or solo voices, to dance to oompah bands or to blue grass combo ,
 
to sleep under overshot coverlets or Hawaiian appliqued quilts or woven  Indian
 
blankets.
 And depending upon individual temperament, family attitudes, the der
nan1s
 
of the larger society, and a myriad other variables, each of us may dedicate so-:1C
_
 
some part of ourselves to emulating those artistic features and techniques we most
 
admire during our growing up days.  We may begin to try p
laying the fiddle , clogging,
 
whittling, singing harmony.
 
A lot can be learned by observation and trial-and-error, or simply being part
 
of the scene.  But there are techniques, materials, specifics that are harder to
 
come by.  Where is the young learner to turn?  Typically, to the grandparental
 
generation.  Parents are generally pretty busy people, earning the money, raising
 
the babies, putting food on the table and clothes on the backs, running the farm
 
or the household or the store or fulfilling the demands of the job.  Even thinking
 
about teaching a young child can be an added imposition, though most parents will
 
"show" a thing or two on the fly.  But the longer term more serious learning
 
relationships generally skip a generation.
 In a recent exhibit of Older Cleveland
 
Folk Artists sponsored by the Cleveland Department of Aging several of the artists
 
tell typical stories:
 Mrs. Anna Jesenko, a Slovenian bobbin lace maker recalls,
 
I learned to make the lace when I was eight years old .
... I didn't
 
go to school for bobbin lace becaus e I learned
 at home.  when you
 
4
 
I
 
learn, you never forget.
 I
'm eighty-one years old now and what I
 
learned at that time is still in my head.
 The older ladies, like
 
the ones who come from our village, they die, and the young ones
 
they don't know how to do it.  When their mothers die, they throw
 
it away.  Now they would like to learn, and they don't have no
 
pillow, no bobbins.
 They don't realize.
 I don't think my daughters
 
know how to make bobbin lace, because they were small I no think
 
about it, to teach them, because that is the best time to t
each
 
the kids.
 And then later, now,  they are too busy.
 But I try to
 
teach my grandson's wife..
 
Ralph C
. Meincke, a 72 year old Cleveland carver and duck decoy maker says,
 
"I taught my grandson to carve.
 It takes a lot of time to show
 
and explain.
 Many, many weeks he came here, and we both sat down
 
and I gave him a bird to carve.  While I was carving one, he did
 
the same thing to learn.  Then he taught his father to carve, but
 
it was harder for my son to learn..."
 
Mrs. Maggie T. Williams, an Afro-American quilter gives us a final variation:
 
"Mama taught me way back in Arkansas and now I'm enjoying it.  Me
 
and my mother did it together, until she passed.  We didn't piece
 
together.
 She'd piece hers and I
'd piece mine, but we'd quilt
 
together.
 She taught me how to do -different things.
 She taught
 
me how to raise children and I try to carry it on like she taught
 
me.
 I came to Cleveland in 1979.  Now I
'm sisty-three... I just
 
love to piece quilts.
 I don't know how come.
 I just love to piece
 
quilts... My daughter could piece quilts, but she don't have time.
 
And so I reckon when she gets older, she may do it.
 I hope so..."
 
We are changing the focus of our discussion from the learner to the teacher,
 
from  the younger to the older, and a sense of pattern is beginning to emerge
 
from a
ll the variables.
 
A number of years
 
5
 
university in California, an area often settled down in by retirees.  My
 
students were all expected to do some field work, and a regular semester
 
assignment was to seek out and do a structured interview with someone over
 
sisty-five.
 Over and over again my horrified students protested they didn't
 
k
iiow anyone over sixty-five; over and over I brutally replied, "They're all
 
around; go make friends.  Beck, you might even try talking to your grandfather!"
 
Such human treasures t
hey found.
 A Van Nuys clock maker who also made and
 
repaired musical  instruments and finally shyly admitted to being able to play tho
 
five string banjo of his youth that now stood in a corner of his shop.  At first
 
too bashful to sing a note, within months he became the star turn at valley folk
 
festivals, striding up to the microphone and  -
o0itiv
-o
-3y belting out his songs
 
like some seventeen year o
dd, his small repair shop jammed with general sociability
 
and young folks learning instrument repair.
 A grandmother in Anaheim who after
 
her interview went up into her attic and brought down her old guitar, an exquisite
 
turn of the century rosewood "lady's model" wrapped carefully in a long silk scarf.
 
No one of her grown children had ever known that their mother both played and
 
sang; her fascinated grandson was her first audience in over fifty years.  An
 
Irish steelworker from the midwest who brought his old Irish "elbow" pipes into
 
retirement with him and who soon developed a sort of human train of young musicians
 
who followed him like a line of ducklings all around La Jolla discussing tunes and
 
techniques, sol citing his views and his criticisms, all of them piping away, -
-
 he
 
joining in when his emphysema allowed, -
-
 on the windswept beaches and in the
 
eucalyptus groves.
 
My students and I became able almost to graph the career lines of these
 
artists.
 All of them had been exposed to their eventual art form in childhood,
 
normally by "picking it up," watching fine musicians or artisans, absorbii
 the
 
aesthetic criteria, getting the feel of what is good and what is better, becoming
 
excited, trying a skill out, making mistakes, getting corrected.
 Some were
 
6
 
universalists, trying out a bit of many crafts and styles, some fewer became
 
entrapped, one might almost say, in a single art form early and made it their
 
own speciality.
 
Childhood moved into young adulthood with increasing energies shown most
 
frequently by the musicians and dancers (
they're good for courtship, after a
ll).
 
But with marriage and growing family responsibilities, much of the artistic activity
 
slacked off; a kind of general latency period set in and life became real and
 
earnest and the "old ways" began to seem less beautiful and interesting.
 My f
ile
 
contain perhaps a hundred interviews containing one or more of t
he following
 
s
tatements here paraphrased for convenience into one.
 "I don't know,  I just
 
stopped quilting (or fiddle playing or embroidery or any number of things) while
 
the children were growing up.
 I was too tired, and we wanted so many things you
 
had to buy and the old things just got to seem
 old-fashioned and corny.
 And
 
then there wasn't any time."
 
But with the arrival of the fifties and sixties, many resumed their old art
 
form like a second career with all the enthusiasm of teen-agers -
-
 and infinitely
 
more knowledge and subtlety.  We began almost to wonder whether the long middle
 
period of inactivity was not so much a time of abandonment of the art as a time
 
for lying fallow, for gathering together energies, ideas, creativity.
 Perhaps
 
the older musicians and dancers could not jump so high nor move so quickly, but
 
the smaller movements and the less frequent notes so often had the elegance and
 
authority that comes only from mastery and from experience.  And the morale -
-
the enthusiasm of the old-young artists and artisans is death-defying.  Mr. Meincke
 
speaks again:
 
"I am more busy now than when I worked.
 The time passes so fast you
 
don't realize how long you are working, because you are so interested
 
i
f
 
in what you are doing..
 
And Mrs. Williams says:
 
leg will be hurting and I will be sitting up in bed piecing.. .My
 
7
 
children get at me, "Mo m,  you' re  going  to  go blind," but I just like
 
to do it.  People love the way I put my colors together..."
 
And Carmen Maria Roman, who came to Cleveland in 1952 from Puerto Rico, and
 
who has taken up again the art of embroidery she learned as a girl...
 
-
 love it, oh boy!  No more pills, no more nervous, I
'm happy!"
 
Sra. Roman works with her niece to produce traditional ornamental favors
 
for weddings, christenings and baptisms, elegant creations of lace ribbons and
 
embroidered flowers.
 They sometimes make as many as five hundred for a special
 
occasion, and the artist remarks, "If you don't have these at a wedding, it's
 
not really a wedding."  No wonder she is happy -
 she has rccnmed a vital role i
n
 
her own culture aided appropriately by a young relative.
 
Here we begin to see the life cycle of a single artist repeating and overi3p if
lg
 
with the brand new oncoming second generation in a never-ending linked chain.
 
Admittedly this is an idealized picture, but most diagrams or analytic schemes
 
are just exactly that:
 idealizations of the knobbly, awkward and ungovernable
 
reality; and a pattern, even though it may not exactly fit any single individual
 
or situation, can still express an essential truth.  What we see, over and over
 
again, not just in the United States but round the world, is that the three
 
generations that overlap in their individual lifetimes interact in the following
 
pattern:
 the grandparents inspire and instruct the children while the adult
 
parents work to support and protect both the young and the old, until such time
 
as they themselves become the grandparents and their own children take up the
 
middle year tasks and a new generation of young ones come along.
 
The late great anthropologist, Margaret Mead, was once asked at a public forum
 
what was the most vital problem in the United States of the 1970's.  Without
 
pausing a heat, she said, "How to put the grandparents back into contact with the
 
grandchildren."  It is dismally true that within the con
temporary United States,
 
at least, changing patterns of housing, employment, and family structures have
 
driven deep rifts into the vital communicative chain that has transmitted cultural
 
8
 
values skills and morale across the generations for millenia.
 It is a deeply
 
troubling situation.
 I myself, with grandchildren on both coasts and a career
 
that keeps me running fast into my middle sixties, find myself dropping in via
 
jet plane, like a modern-day Mary Poppins, on my beloved grandchildren, and
 
dropping right back out in no more than a week.  We barely get to say hello.
 
What can be done about all this?  Well, I
'm just a folklorist, and I don't
 
have any particular solution to recommend, but I have observed a few factors
 
that I think we could work with to our great benefit.
 For instance, in connecLi'f
l
 
with my job as a grants officer for an arts agency, I have often asked folk arti;tS
 
t
hat I meet what they would really most like to be doing.
 A poignantly large
 
number of the older ones say that what they would really l
ike to do is teach young
 
people.
 Over and over they say that they want to get into the schools, to work
 
with the children, to be allowed to be in touch with the generation that has a
lways
 
been their special historical responsibility.
 Can this not ever be arranged?
 
Not everywhere, of course, nor with every senior citizen, many of whom announce
 
forthrightly that they have done their bit for future generations and want to
 
relax for a while.
 But so very many artists -
-
 especially, it seems, the artists -
-
really long for a genuine contact with the young.
 
The city of Ann Arbor tried to follow through on Dr. Mead's suggestion by
 
circularizing their senior citizens with an invitation to come help out in the
 
schools if they wanted.  The last I heard the idea had worked out very well
 
without special funding or supervisory bureaucracy -
-
 just the seniors who wanted
 
to coming into the schools and helping the children out in crafts programs or
 
cooking or whittling or American history or Poetry.
 Some of them got help with
 
transportation and most of them got a hot lunch but that was all.
 I don't know
 
what the situation is now, but it really doesn't seem important -
-
 if it worked
 
for a while, then that's fine, and every community will have to work out their
 
own particular pattern anyway.
 The basic idea is to use the schools as a meeting
 
ground for seniors and children when their own grandparents and their own
 
9
 
grandchildren are far away.
 
Another observation that is crystal c
lear to any folklorist is that our
 
older citizens are incomparable aesthetic resources. 
So much of the gerontological
 
literature that I glance through basically treats the elderly as a problem, and
 
old age as a time of life when a burdensome series of special conditions have to
 
he met.
 In folk arts, the elderly are, generally speaking, thought of as t
he
 
solution, rather than the problem (or at least as a solution)  and we worry about
 
meeting their needs in order that they may continue to be productive an d counselling
 
and helping us onward with their wisdom and experience and toughness and smarts.
 
1
t'-
; quite a different point of view, and I recommend it to all those who work
 
with the elderly.
 It's a more respectful and considerate stance, and that is
 
a
lways productive of cooperation and achievement.
 
Finally, I would like to suggest that the overall every-other-generational
 
pattern that I refer to as "the chain" is an infinitely subtle and effective
 
communicative pattern that provides both for continuity and for change in proportions
 
that are balanced with extraordinary delicacy.  We will neither remain mired in
 
the past nor careen rudderless into the mysterious future if we can respectfully
 
help maintain this age-old system of order.
 In it, both the old and the young
 
have their appointed responsibilities, their traditional and crucial roles.
 
(
They may, of course, swap positions and often do; I know many radical grandparents
 
and plenty of conservative children, but in general a certain balance tends to
 
maintain.)
 Even in such mundane interactions as learning to make baking powder
 
biscuits or how to tune a fiddle "Sebastopol" style, the leit-motifs of "Well,
 
the way I always heard it" and "But why couldn't it?" intertwine in a never-ending
 
ballet of push and shove, give and take, calm and excitement, stability and
 
tt
-
's P
%"
 
-c e+ y-
 It's a great system, and I hate to see it weakening because half of
 
the participants are in retirement villages and the other half have gone off to
 
day camp.
 
10
 
I have wandered a bit,  it may seem, from my central topic of folk arts and
 
the elderly.  But not really.
 Our traditional arts, the ways of magnifying and
 
decorating our lives through which we express our sense of ourselves and our
 
belongingneSS to our own special people, are the essential preserve of experienced
 
and senior practitioners.
 They often appear simple, but a lifetime may be needed
 
to get them just exactly right.
 And all this experience, all this devotion and
 
skill turns to ashes, if the human cha in is  not  in  workin
g order,  if there is no
 
one to pass the art on to.
 The late black quilter, Pecolia Warner of Yazoo City,
 
ississippi sums it all up,
 
"I worked that to grow up in me, of making quilts.
 That was a gift,
 
that's my talent.
 Making quilts, that's my calling.  And since I
 
learned when I was young I haven't forgotten it.
 I don't necessarily
 
altogether piece them for myself.
 I like to help people with them...
 
just giving them for the "remember me"...

Some twenty years ago  I attended i an  international  meeting
 
of anthropologists and ethnologists  in Chicago.
 I was much younger then
 
and this was my f
irst b
ig international  meeting and  I was overawed  by
 
the i
llustrious names  that surrounded me and powerfully impressed by the
 
r
'
.
 
4 '-i"ana-y of themes  that emerged from the d
iscussions.
 Over and over
 
again  it turned out we were talking about the same b
ig  problems  in
 
Africa, Australia,  the United States,  the Societ
 
I
ndia.
 The world began to draw c
loser and c
loser together but never
 
so much so as late one eyanimN n
ight when we had spent the evening  i
n
 
an  intense d
iscussion conQerning the enormous over-crowding of the great
 
c
ities  from Khartoum to T
imbucktu to  Delhi  to Moscow to New York,  and
 
what could possibly be
 
dowe about it.
 As the weary conferees  straggled out into the cold
 
ear iyxko mrs Chicago streets  in the early hours, my brother suddenly
 
announced there was a c
lassic American song that posed the problem
 
exactly and we a
ll  waltzed a
long with the Chinese and  Indian and R
ussian
 
delegations teaching them the words to  "How're you gonna keep
 
on the  f
arm after they;ve seen Paree? 
C
 
That Phrasing has somehow never left me,  and  I recommend it to
 
youx  f
or serious consideration
 it
cause  I think folklorists  h
ave a
 
few of the  ideas that may possibly help eorreEtxthe m
itigate the huge
 
H
 
imbalance between a€txø,x the action available in country and c
ity.
 To
 
p
ut it in simpi possibly over s

it
 
and the l
ike
 traditionally
 
about,how local  communities and local  ethnicities/have/organized their
 
and gaiety
 
l
ives so as to put some fun and adventure and excitement/into the p
icture.
 
And the pricklings of my thumbs  tell  me that the concerns of
 
em down
 
people outside the major metropolitan areas  are g
oing to become of greater
 
and greater peTit4c3.1 concern.
 It's  not just that the phrase  "rural
 
i
nitiatives"  i
s  becoming the code-word around the Arts  Endowment;  I
 
across  the country are
 
get the general  sense that the rural  areas/is where the next b

I were p

I have been invited by Rick Moody to edit a special
 
issue devoted to folkart and the elderly of The Journal of
 
Human Values and Aging. 
This edition will examine the
 
important role of elders as the repositories and transmitters
 
of cultural knowledge, will look at the topic of reminiscence
 
and life-review,  and will also include case studies of older
 
folk artists as well as educational
'xhibition program
 
suggestions.
 Elaine Eff,  Elena Bradumus,  Kurt Dewhurst and
 
Marsha MacDonald are also working with me on this issue.
 
These scholars were consultants to the Older Cleveland
 
Folk Artists Exhibition, which I curated a few years ago.
 
It is with hopeful anticipation that I am writing to
 
invite you to contribute to this special issue.
 Essays  for
 
publication should not exceed 15 typewritten pages.
 An
 
article by you would greatly enhance this special edition,
 
and would contribute to our goal of making it a valuable
 
handbook for all those interested in folkart,  the elderly,
 
and the intergenerational
, transmission of culture,  and
 
the creative possibilities  of the  later years.
 
I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you
 
will agree to prepare an essay for this  special issue of
 
The Journal of Human Values and Aging. 
Thank you.
 
Sincere
