I should like xw now to discuss some thoughts concerning th
 
preservation and dissemination of the folk arts.
 It is often said,  a
i
x
 
and corrdctly,  that the folk arts are a seed bed from which fine
 
arts traditionally draw inspiration,  and often substance,  as well.
 
We are all familiar with the fact that composers from Beethoven
 
to Bartok have utilized folk melodies in their compositions,  that
 
dramatists from Sophocles -
-
 to use an example that has been very
 
popular in this room the last few days -
-
 to Arthur Miller have based
 
their dramatic work on legends and mythic materials.
 But the well
 
of folk creativity and inspiration is not inexhaustible.
 Something
 
must be returned,  some nourishment must be provided so that the
 
creative juices can continue to flow.
 
We usually think of folklore work as the careful documentation,
 
recording,  arranging,  and analysis of folklore data and its presenta-
tion to the general and s
, olarly public,  either through books and
 
recordings or through choreographed stage performances such as the
 
presentation of the world-famous Moisayev ballet.
 These are all
 
important ways of working with folklore materials that must be
 
continued.
 However,  they all have a similar impact on the folk
 
traditions themselves:  to a greater or lesser extent,  they take
 
the materials and, most especially,  the action -
-
 the artistic
 
event itselfAaway
 from and sometimes out of reach of the originators
 
of the culture.
 
In the United States we have been worrying about this,  and
 
have been trying to develop ways to reverse the flow of energy
 
and provide stimulation and take the -power back,  in a sense,  to
 
,
 
the people -
-
 to the folk artists themselves.,1 If any of you are
 
interested in some of the techniques we have tried and found successful
 
or wanting,  I should be happy to discuss them wk with you but do not
 
wish to take up the time of this assembly in such detail.
 
Instead I should like to relate this to a wider phenomenon -
-
-
I L
 
the worldwide
 towards centralization,  demonstrated most vividly
 
by the rush of peoples all over the world,  from the countrysid to
 
the cities.
 As sociologists produce study after study deploring the
 
bad effects of urban over-crowding,  people K
ki everywhere 
A continue
 
to move iinto thee cities where they believe
 
depopulated,

is,  leaving

INSER PARAGRAPH

I was greatly moved to hear Dr.  Likbachev of the USSR discussing
 
the efforts being made in the Soviet Union to protect their
 
indigenous peoples,  their small linguistic groups.
 In the United
 
States, we share a similar concern for the futures of our native
 
American tribal peoples as well as our small ethnic groups,  and we
 
have been experimenting with the thoughtthat perhaps such peoples
 
can move into the modern world not totally bereft of their communicatiuB
 
culture
 
system , that they might be able at least to bring with them kkm at
 
least some part of their symbolic systems -
-
 their living art forms -
-
music,  dance,  craft...  In this vein we have developed a project that
 
is sometimes called "The Return"  in which we are trying to get back to
 
the people whose culture the larger world has recorded copies of the
 
recordings,  tapes, books,  films a
xs xf xtk produced hbout their art.
 
For example we have been copying the recordings of American Indian
 
music recorded by early anthropologists on the old-fashion cyllinder
 
recording machines and getting these musical treasures back to t
 ke
 
present day p tribal descendants.
 We have been working with other
 
techniques as well,  somazofxwhiokxk which I would be glad to share
 
with anyone interested.
 
More importantly,  communication then begins to take place in one
 
direction primarily,  from the populous highly charged,  better
 
financed urban centers out into the less powerful,  less peopled rural
 
zones..  As our esteemed Finnish colleacre pointed out,  the same thing
 
happens internationally -
-
 communication and distribution is primarily
 
from the big national centers outward to and sometimes smack on top
 
of the smaller nations.
 Perhaps our colleagues from the media will tackle
 
it next week.
 The electronic switch,  after all, works equally well
 
and efficiently both directions.
 One can flip a switch,  and the
 
signal can go from the center to the perimeter or from ke the perimeter
 
to the center.
 It is a powerful tool for human progress and understanding.
 
Which brings me to mention that I have been somewhat disheartened
 
to hear so many speakers refer to kau televiosion in terms thar suggest
 
it is impossible to control or even influence.
 It is a human invention.
 
It is not magical.
 We must learn kø how to put it to the service of
 
humanity and of art.
 We will probably disagree on just how to do this
 
but disagreements are not catastrophic;  sometimes the energy generated
 
from disagreements propels us forward.
 It will be a noble effort at
 
all events.
 
There seem to be two general strategies for coping with the television
 
medium,  one positive and one negative.
 The most dramatic of the negative
 
strategies is jamming,  an ugly process that developed,  I believe,  during
 
World War II and is,  I am told still in use in certain places.
 As an
 
individual citizen of the United States and of the world,  I must tell
 
you that this grieves me very much.
 Jamming is not an appropriate process
 
for peace.
 I profoundly believe that each individual must retain control
 
over his own reception of information and stimulation,  turning his own
 
personal switch off and on by the power of his own magnificent thumb,
 
a
 
at his own command,  accepting or rejecting according to his own
 
judgment.  (And I should add parenthetically that,  in my capacity
 
as a parent I have exercised the authority of the parental thumb,
 
quite a different process than the one we are discussing here.)
 
I must add immediately
 that this power must be exercised l
oy
 
within a situation where each individual has the full range of
 
information and artistic experience and summatiun to select
 
must be time on the aixxføxxaIix domestic and international
 
all:  fine arts and folk arts and popular arts;  experimental
 
from.
 There
 
air for
 
art and
 
classic art;  news from Canada and news from Cyprus,  the particular
 
exciting and different visit
hns of Iceland,  Turkey and Bulgaria.
 In
 
the United States,  there is a rule that equal time on the air must be
 
provided for all political parties during an election.
 It is a difficult
 
rule;  it causes much argument and there is usually a lawsuita about
 
it going on somewhere or other.
 But it is a rule that all Americans
 
support and approve of in principle,  however untidy and difficult its
 
ramifications.
 I tell my colleagues in the United States that we should
 
extend that principle to guarantee some measure of domestic prime
 
time for all the smaller art forms,  for the auieter or the less popular
 
or in any event the different artistic folk traditions,  else our
 
nation will turn into a homogenized lump of tøa totally chewed up but
 
undigested cultures.
 Or,  as my brother once put it,  if the rush
 
toward standardization goes on unchecked there will soon be no place
 
on ea the surface of the earth worth visiting -
-
 and no particular
 
reason to stay home either.
 
If all the musical languages of the world oouid -
-
 just to take
 
this idea a bit further -
-
 could receive equal cultural time on the air
 
waves,  our European friends'  concerned about being overwhelmed by
 
American punk rock might be alleviated.
 I believe there are some
 
musical styles around the world that could give punk rock a run for its
 
money,  some serious conpetition.
 
Ladies and gentlemen,  Professor Voight pf Hungary and I were fan-
tasizing a bit during lunch just now and we dreamed a most beautiful
 
dream -
-
 that som the 35 governments represented here might rent or
 
buy or shoot up into the sky by some means or another,  a European
 
cultural satellite that would whirl around the earth over our heads
 
forever more broadcasting the arts of all the nations represented here
 
each nation mikk the same -
-
 all the musics,  all the drama,  all the
 
narratives,  all the poetry,  all the languages.
 It is probably only
 
a dream,  but it seems there should be a little time ø x
x wt within
 
our deliberations when the dreams may be advanced and lie there on
 
the table for all to consider.
 Perhaps that way they can one day become
 
real.
 Human beings have much power.
 Thank you
