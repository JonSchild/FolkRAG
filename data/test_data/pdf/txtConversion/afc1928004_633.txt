Wait ' till the roses are blooming, ' 
Spring will bring blossoms and flowers; 
Bees seeking sweets in the clover, 
Birds making love in the bowers. 
Nights when the soft summer breezes, 
Whisper love over the sea; 
Then I 
will linger at evening, 
In the soft moonlight with thee. 
Wait till the roses are blooming, 
Spring will bring blossoms and flowers; 
Breath of the morning perfuming, 
Decking our dear trysting bowers. 
Wait ' till the roses are blooming, 
Red in the rich ruddy light; 
Breath of the morning perfuming, 
Decked by the dew-drops of night. 
Red as the roses I 
greet thee, 
Down on the shell covered shore; 
In the dusk twilight Ill meet thee, 
We'll part again never more. 
Wait 'till the roses are blooming, 
And grasses gleam in the sun; 
With hues of emerald splendor, 
Then shall my darling be won. 
Roses will pale ' fore her blushes, 
When I 
tell love in the vale; 
It may be sung by the thrushes, 
put they will ne'er tell the tale.

Young people all, both great and small, come listen to my 
news, 
It is a 
song I'm going to sing of the murder in Cohoes: 
When Catherine Dunsbach, the victim, was slain in licr 
house, you all know, 
And Latrimouille he murdered her, and soon to the gal 
lows he'll go. 
Next day the people they all knew, when the Coroner 
spread the news, 
That Latrimouille had murdered her and gone out o-C 
Cohoes; 
No one saw him murder her, it was all between them both, 
But the Doctor soon examined her, and said he'd cut her 
throat. 
He walked along the street so wild, and was in the best of 
cheer; 
He walked down into Shep's saloon and called for a 
2-lass 
of beer. 
They viewed his hat, his shirt, his pants, his coat, his vest, 
his shoes— 
And he was at the mercy of the policeman in Cohoes. 
And soon the detectives followed him all around the coun-
try and back, 
They arrived at Port Henry, and found him in a 
black-
smith shop, 
They brought him back to Cohoes Jail, where he was 
guarded well, 
They shut the door and locked him up in a 
murderer's 
dark cell.

THE MURDER IN COHOES.—CoNTnwED. 
For three long months he laid in Jail, and no one could he 
see, 
Except his father and his mother, and a 
Priest from Al-
bany. 
He chewed and smoked the whole day long, and at night 
fell on his knees, 
And begged the Lord to pardon him for all his wicked 
deeds. 
The morning of his trial, he grieved till his heart was sore, 
To hear the witnesses of Cohoes how hard, on him they 
swore; 
Some did their duty nobly, before our blessed Lord, 
While others shouted, hang him, or well lose a 
big reward. 
The morning after his trial, as you can plainly sec, 
The Jury went into a 
back room, and soon they did agree; 
The Jury found him guilty, and the Judge made this reply: 
On the twenty-ninth of August you are condemned to die. 
For seven long weeks he laid in Jail, and all this time he 
hoped 
That he might gain his liberty before he saw the rope; 
But now my days are ended, I 
bid you all farewell, 
It's many a 
dark and dreary night I've laid in a 
murderer's 
cell. 
say farewell to my father, likewise my mother dear, 
I 
say farewell to my loving wife—my child 
ne'er see; 
I 
am dying on the gallows—my children never tell, 
And when I 
am dead and in my grave I 
bid you all fare-
well. 
And now I 
ascend the scaffold steps, I 
bid you all adieu, 
The hangman is a 
waiting, ' tis a 
quarter after two; 
The black cap now is on my face, no longer can I 
see, 
And when I 
am dead and in my grave the Lord remember 
me.

WHO WILL BUY MY TOYS. 
Written and sung by Miss Ames DAILY. 
0 
To please you, friends, I 
am going to try, 
If I 
succeed I 
think you will buy 
My nice little toys of which I 
show. 
Buy them, for they will please you I 
know. 
I 
have large and small as you can see, 
From an elephant down to a 
little monkey; 
So buy this one, a 
nickel the price, 
For babies play with them so nice. 
CHORUS. 
Who will buy my toys, come step this way, 
Buy them, be quick, for I 
am not going to stay; 
Thy will please your dear little children so nice, 
You may pick the best for they are all one price. 
I 
have a 
nice little lamb that cries mahah, 
And a 
talking doll that shouts da da, 
A cradle to rock little babies to sleep, 
And a 
nice little bird that sings very sweet. 
I 
have a 
jack in the box, that causes much fun, 
Is there any one here that wishes one; 
I 
have a 
lion and a 
duck and a 
donkey and goose, 
But I 
think there is too many running loose.

You Can't Have It All Your Own Way. 
Comic motto song by DAN LEWIS. 
As sung by MISS Amcn DAILY: 
with great success. 
Copyrighted 1881, and all rights reserved 
by B. W. 1-IrreacocK, Music publisher, 166 Nassau St., N.Y, 
When I 
was a 
boy about eight years of age, 
My father sent me to a 
school; 
Although he was thinking me such a 
good boy, 
I 
never would go as a 
rule. 
My father soon tumbled, and quickly he 
Was watching me day after day; 
At last, when he questioned me, says he: you young 
dog, 
You can't have it all your own way. 
CHORUS. 
No, you can't have it all your own way, sir, 
You can't have it all your own way; 
I 
am telling you straight, before it's too late, 
You can't have it all your own way. 
At last I 
got married, but murdered I 
mean, 
I 
took a 
nice girl for my wife; 
Although I 
was thinking her such a 
good girl, 
She gave me but trouble and strife. 
The night came upon us, danger was near, 
She'd throw rocking chairs at my head, 
If I 
said but my prayers, she'd throw me down 
stairs, 
In fact, kick me right out of bed.

Oh, here I 
am, an Irish girl, 
Was born in Londonderry; 
A

The other side of Kerry. 
My mother she had a 
little pig, 
She had me for to mind it.. 
Like every other little pig, 
It carried its tail behind it. 
Ctiont7s: 
For I 
love to roam, and I 
left my home. 
And traveled to a 
far off laml; 
Although I'm across the ocean, 
I 
can't forget devotion to poor old Ireland, 
Oh, to America I 
made my way, 
And friends I 
found warm-hearted, 
I 
can't forget old Ireland yet, 
From them I 
dearly parted. 
I 
like the boys, I 
like the girls, 
I 
like the American manners, 
And if you want an Irish girl, 
will fight beneath the banners.

OUR BOARDING HOUSE. 
Written by HARRY CLARK, for Miss ALICE DAILY, and sung by her 
with great success. 
I 
am going to try and tell you, 
If you listen unto me; 
Its about a 
spicy boarding house, 
In Frog street No. three. 
Kent by a 
man named Dougherty, 
An Irishman of course; 
It's a 
regular European, 
:North American boarding house. 
Cuonus. 
There is Cornelius Slattery, just from the Battery, 
Jimmy Began and Mike McGlue; 
Big foot Hennessy, Patsy Lary, 
In a 
bed in number two. 
Jerry Hawley, a 
man from Galway, 
Jim Maloon and a 
fellow called Mouse; 
Coopers, Sailors, Cobblers, Tailors, 
Down at Dougherty's boarding house. 
On week days we have liver, 
On Sundays we have mush; 
And when the bell for dinner rinp, 
You ought to .-Ite them rush. 
And how they make the landlord simm, 
As each one makes a 
grab; 
And demolish everything they see, 
Would make your heart feel sad. 
And when at night you go to bed, 
And try and get some sleep; 
Then in walks big O'Donnell, 
With number fifteen feet. 
And bed bugs, too, they stick like Om, 
And promenade in gangs; 
Bio• hor,e flies sting your eyes 
And mosquitocs on your hand.

Oh, Sue, you saucy darling, 
You've charmed my heart away; 
I 
love you in the morning, 
And I 
love you all the day. 
You're sometimes kind and gentle, 
And my heart is lifted high; 
But when you're cross and wayward, 
Then I 
think I'll surely die. 
CHontrs. 
Say so Susie, saucy Susie, 
Never, never leave me for to sigh so, Sue, 
If you love me, saucy Sue, 
Why wouldn't it be better for to say so, Sue. 
Now Sue, you know I 
love you, 
I'm sure you love me, too; 
But when I 
thought I 
bad you, 
Like a 
flea, away you flew. 
But flea, or flitch of bacon, 
Like a 
mag-pie or a 
fly; 
Oh, Susie, if you'll have me, 
There'll be none so gay as I.

BOARDING HOUSE BUTTER. 
Written, composed and sung by PAUL Danssna. 
I 
like to see things as they're represented, 
But they're not always just as they seem; 
Go into a 
four dollar hash house, 
There you see the bright side of life's dream. 
But the subject that I'm going to sing abot uow 
Is something that will make your heart flutter, 
If you want to enjoy yourself, 
Tackle some ancient boarding house butter. 
CHORUS.—Butter with wrinkles on it, 
Butter that oft takes a 
fit, 
Bald-headed butter too utterly utter, 
Butter that has seen better days; 
Butter that's almost worn out, 
Butter that will give you the gout, 
Oleomargarine made out of benzine, 
Strong butter, well, I 
should shout. 
SECOND CHORUS. 
flash that's been on many drunks, 
Hash made from the hinges of trunks; 
flash made of onions, 
Hash frescoed with bunions, 
Hash that they sleep on for bunks. 
Hash that would make a 
lamp flicker, 
Hash that is worse than had liquor; 
Hash neuter gender, made out of suspenders, 
Good hash, well, I 
should snicker. 
THIRD CHORUS. 
Cheese that could walk every mile 
In 24, well, I 
should smile; 
Cheese for your breakfast, 
Cheese 'way from Texas, 
Cheese as strong as a 
big William goat. 
Cheese that's been thrown in the gutter, 
Cheese that's worse than the butter; 
Cheese that's got speckles 
And red-headed freckles, 
Cheese it, well, I 
should stutter.

rbough seas now divide, and the mountains so wide, 
I'll never once forget you far away; 
But I 
treasure still the flower that you gave me one 
sweet hour, 
When we watched the lads and lasses dancing gay, 
You've longed for my coming, and I've wept bitter 
tears, 
Your Scotch lassie still is your own; 
She never will be false, for her heart she left with you 
No! your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, laddie, my laddie far away, 
Still would your darling die for you; 
She never will be false, ah, no! no matter what they 
say, 
No, your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
Then, love, don't forget that I 
think of you yet, 
Mid Scotland's bonnie hills across the sea; 
And though far away I 
roam, alt! I 
know there is a 
It ome 
That is waiting there, my own, for you and me; 
HI come to you laddie, like the bird to its nest, 
For still I 
am praying for you; 
HI this world so fair I 
am loving you the best, 
your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true.

I've been thinking to-day of the happy years ago, 
r' 
And the tears quickly gathered in my eyes; 
As I 
held within my hand a 
portrait and a 
flower, 
Tokens bound to me by many sacred ties. 
The picture is my mothers, and she sent it cross the 
sea, 
And a 
blessing to her wandering son she gave; 
And this little faded flower blossomed on the grassy 
mound, 
For they sent me a 
rose from mother's grave. 
• 
Cuoitus: 
• 
When you kneel down in prayer near the spot where 
she's laid, 
Remember this favor that I 
crave; 
Oh! take from the holy ground a 
blossom from the 
mound, 
And send me a 
rose frcrn mothers grave. 
I 
would give all this world if it were mine to give, 
If my mother Could return to me again; 
I 
would strive then to repay her many acts of love, 
For my heart is calling, and it calls in vain. 
Never more to feel her kisses and her words of bright-
est cheer; 
When she bid me hope, be patient, true and brave, 
And I 
keep my little flower ever near where e'er I 
go, 
For it blossomed on my angel mother's grave.

Published by permission. 
Now listen to me, one and all, 
You boys of Erin's Isle; 
The tyrant's hand is laid once more 
Upon your native soil. 
The time has come, go to the front, 
And save your native land; 
She cries for help, so all unite 
And lend a 
helping hand. 
CHORUS. 
You'll all be wanted, 
You'll all be wanted, 
Be in time, fall in line; 
Lose not a 
day, for you'll be wanted, 
Yes, you'll all be wanted. 
Ireland's up in arms! 
Away! away! 
You'll way! 
The Irish race is living yet, 
Young, vigorous and strong; 
Irish hearts are true as when 
O'Donnell battled wrong. 
Oh! pause not in your onward march, 
And, oh! remember this: 
'Twas weakness in the past that left 
Your country as it is. 
England's rules are as cruel yet, 
As 
in the days ago; 
Now is the time, declare yourselves, 
And give her blow for blow. 
Remember, men, that words are weak, 
As foam of angry sea; 
The bayonet, sword, and musket ball 
Make pathways for the free.

GAUGER PILL- GARLIC.

Banjo March Player in the world.

:0:----
Oh! freckled face Gauger Pill-garlic, 
The bummers and loafers all cry; 
They say use your head for a 
bucket, 
.k nd smother yourself in mince pie; 
They say you're the worst in creation, 
A 
free lunch you'd tackle without fear; 
A 
station house is a 
great recreation, 
And this is the slang you will hear. 
CHORUS: 
A 
sixer for the Gauger Pill-garlic, 
For working a 
servant girl's pocket; 
lie thought he'd go off on a 
racket, 
And drink with the money quite free. 
A copper nabbed him by the collar 
And said " give that girl every dollar; 
In Sing Sing I'll give you a 
parlor, 
And you can't crack a 
crib any mere.' 
The tramp and the political bummer 
has a 
nose that from rum brightly shines; 
And never does hard work ever bother them, 
And they're always complaining of the times. 
With a 
tomato can and a 
stick in their pocket, 
On the watch for new kegs of stale beer; 
Oh! a 
bar-room with a 
fire in the Winter 
Gives a 
gauger a 
jolly old steer. 
GAUGER PILL-GARLIC—CONTINUED. 
CHORUS: 
Then where is the Gauger Pill-garlic, 
His face it would give you the colic; 
I 
think he's gone off on a 
frolic 
With a 
man by the name of Rooney. 
lies drinking champagne in the poor house, 
And feeding on feather weight hash; 
They say he's gone off with Brother Talmage, 
And with Beecher and Elizabeth to mash. 
Oh! jailers and coppers all know him, 
A 
staff once he was on the press; 
Ten cents for a 
ball he does owe me, 
And he gives me a. puff of his breath 
lie says be is tired of mashing, 
The girl that he had acted queer, 
lie searched for her all over Blackwell's Island. 
And he found her with a 
ball and chain on her ear. 
Cuonus: 
Then cheer up old Gauger Pill-garlic, 
Brace up and get full of stale beer, 
Join a 
circus, hire out as a 
toothpick, 
And sit on the sharp edge of a 
spear. 
Dennis Kearney is looking for labor, 
Parnell he's the ladies' fond dear; 
Old Ireland we'll never forget you, 
The country that we love most dear.

There's a 
pretty little maiden, 
That I 
ever shall adore, 
In Italy that bright and sunny land; 
My life would be a 
pleasure, 
I 
would wish for nothing more, 
If she would only share my heart and hand; 
Her father is a 
brigand, 
On a 
lonely mountain pass, 
And with him on the mountain she does dwell; 
There is no titled lady, 
In all Europe can surpass, 
That dear Italian girl I 
love so well. 
CHORUS: 
Though her father is a 
brigand on the mountain, 
She's as gentle as the daughter of an Earl; 
And although she set me free, 
My heart will ever be, 
A captive to that dear Italian girl. 
While roaming lovely valleys, 
'Neath the blue and sunny skies, 
A 
band of sturdy brigands bold and strong, 
Did capture me, and helpless, 
With a 
bandage o'er my eyes, 
A 
victim, I 
was quickly led along,

THE ITALIAN GIRL. —CONTINUE13. 
Pive thousand pounds as ransom, 
They demanded I 
should pay, 
Hilt that I 
was not rich enough to give, 
And only for the pleadings 
Of that little mountain maid, 
They would not hate permitted me to live. 
(Chorus) 
They put me in a dungeon 
Where I 
thought that I 
should die, 
And while flit brigand thief with all his band, 
Were plundering poor travelers, 
This lovely girl came nigh, 
In gloomy night and by my side did stand; 
She tore my bands asunder, 
Bade me rise and quickly fly, 
And from her fathers coffers gave me gold; 
And while the tears of love and pity, 
Glistened in her eye, 
The secrets of our hearts were plainly told. 
(Chorus). 
bid her then to fly with me, 
And be my darling bride, 
Although her love for me was plainly shown, 
Her duty she declared, 
Was by her outlawed father's side, 
And so to America I 
returned alone; 
But I 
cannot live forever 
In this free and happy land, 
To Italy I'm going to return, 
To seek with love, and try to win,

SOMETHING TO TICKLE THE GIRLS. 
Written by A. 
W . 
FRENCH. 
Snug by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Coinique. 
Music by T. B. 
KELLEY. 
The pet of the girls ev'ry where, 
Society calls me a 
wit; 
For nothing gets on unless there, 
I 
drop in to please them a 
bit ; 
I've stories not few, and jokes that are new, 
As brilliant they tell me as pearls; 
NoLsense now and then is ijed by all men, 
Of course it will tickle the 'girls. 
CHORUS' 
Someth.ng to tickle the girls, 
Laughing and shaking their curls; 
You'll not go amiss, I 
promise you this, 
With something to tickle the girls. 
Some chaps they are terrible bores, 
Some spoony and dull as a 
hoe; 
No kind that a 
gay girl adores, 
She favors no one who is slow; 
Some fellows are shy, and others they try, 
To please when as crabbid as churls; 
I'm not either one, I 
can revel in fun, 
And can always tickle the girls. 
(Chorus). 
Then take my advice ev'ry one, 
And put it at once to the test; 
Go in with the girls and have fun, 
For that is just what suits them best; 
They like a 
gay heart, who does well his part, 
To cheer them as life swiftly whirls; 
You're always their friend, to love and commend, 
With something to tickle the girls. 
(Chorus),

On Scotland's fair hills, or the mountains and rills. 
I've wandered there many a 
happy day; 
In looking at the lads and the lasses on the green, 
'Neath the fine old hills of Scotland far away. 
I've looked for her corning, but she's not come as yet, 
The truth seems to dawn on me plain; 
They say she is false but I'll still believe her mine, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
0 Jean, my dearest Jean 
Come to your laddie once again; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine, 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said she soon would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain, 
In lands far away she doth roam; 
Her promise she will keep, 0 ! break it not, my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Then let me not long wait, let me meet you soon, my Jean. 
And Heav'n will then smile on our love; 
And when life is ended, we'll leave this earthly scene, 
When our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above. 
0 
Jean, my dearest . Jean! 
Come to your laddie once again ; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you min. 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean.

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you cart see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
CHORUS: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
pager came out-with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a 
con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants. 
awrus 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock. 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geoghan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-keeper shot me a 
glance; 
" 
Howld your tongues " then said he to the loafers 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

Good Bye Polly. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique. 
I 
loved a 
girl named Polly, and thought that she loved me, 
So joined a 
ship to take a 
trip across the briny sea, 
And when the morning had arrived for me to sail away, 
1 gave the lass a 
parting kiss, and then to her did say: 
CHORUS. 
Good bye Polly, I 
must leave you, 
Let us hope the parting will not grieve you, 
The ship it sails to-day, some thousand miles away, 
So think of me when I 
am on the sea. 
She vowed that she'd be true to me while I 
was away, 
And thinking what she said was right, I 
left her my half j-ny 
Then with a 
sigh bid her good-bye, and as they heaved the lead. 
I 
left her standing on the shore, then jumped aboard and sa 
Good bye, Polly, & c. 
I 
saw her in my dreams at night, I 
thought of her all day, 
But did not think that she was false to me, when far away; 
For I 
must own when I 
alone, was lying, on my bed, 
I 
often woke up in a 
fright, and these words have said: 
Good bye, Polly, & c. 
Some years had passed when I 
returned, with lots of gold 
in store, 
And just you fancy my surprise, when I 
knocked at, the doo.& 
They told me Poll was married, she had been false to me, 
So now no more I'll st 
chore, I'm off again to sea. 
Good bye, Polly, & c.

And Augustine Delia Clancey that's the bell-t.

And all those lovely songs she sings to me.

And go to sleep my Baby Mine. 
She sings, she sings such pretty tunes, 
The girl I 
love I'll marry soon.

The Misses Scott and Doyle, 
Sitting in the parlor all so fine. 
Sure Smithy has comical talk, 
And such a 
funny walk, 
Which causes all the party for to smile. 
When Miss Clancey does appear 
Such curious things you'll hear, 
" 
Miss Clancey, dear, you're looking all serene," 
She smiles and bows her head, 
To the piano she lightly treads, 
And all those loyely songs she sings to me. 
She sings, she sings, &c.

Come to Casey's tin pan wedding, 
All the Irish will be there; 
Oh, such howling and such growling, 
And such cutting up so quare;

That resides in New York Town; 
Wearing high hats like a

All the gang will sure be down.

All the Irish will be there, 
Bring along your Bridget fair; 
Make her wear her Sunday hair, 
When in the set she's dancing;

When the gang gets in a 
row; 
None but buffaloes will be there, 
At Casey's Tin Pan Wedding. 
There will be ale, stale beer and whisky, 
Goose chowder and cat pie; 
And when Casey he gets tipsy, 
He will slug Riley in the eye; 
Old Pat Shay and Tim Maloney, 
From the town of Donnegal; 
Danced a 
reel for stale bologna, 
Qn the top of Casey's wall.

THE EMBLEMS OF IRELAND. 
As sung by Wm. IT. M ORTON, America's Comique, at the Academy of 
Music, Chicago, III. 
I 
wear two lovely emblems, 
I 
wear them on my breast, 
The harp entwined with shamrock 
Is the emblem I 
love best, 
They're symbols of old Erin, 
Thc place that gave me birth, 
The sacred spot of Erin 
Is the dearest spot on earth. 
Crtonus. 
The harp and the shamrock of Erin, 
The harp and the shamrock for me, 
When ' ere my voice I 
raise I'll always sing in praise 
Of the harp and shamrock of Erin. 
When I 
see a 
bunch of shamrocks 
I 
think of St. Patrick's day, 
And if I 
hear its tune struck up, 
It makes my heart feel gay, 
My spirit overcomes me, 
And on Erin sweet I 
call, 
Just touch the harp of Erin, 
And I'll sing Tara's Hall. 
(Chorus). 
The old stone cross of Ireland, 
Is an emblem great and grand, 
With the wolf dog resting calmly 
Near the round towers of our laud, 
Their relics dear to Irishmen, 
No matter where I 
roam, 
Good men are always firm and true 
To emblems of their own. 
(Chorus).

How the pleasures were ecstatic for 
The best of

asked to see her home 
She said " I 
can't refuse."

Oh, when I 
hear, etc. 
Just the other day I 
popped the question, 
She said " I 
can't decline,"

Will be her home and mine. 
We invite you all to call and see us, 
And hope you won't refuse; 
And if kindness fails to greet you there, 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
Oh, when I

I'll Tell Nobody. 
/Ns sung by EmmA ROGPRS in the original sketch written by HARRY MC 
Avov, entitled " Going to the Raffle." 
Oh, I 
am in love, but I'll not tell with whom, 
For I 
know very well what some folks would do— 
They'd chatter and flatter and make themselves fine, 
And poor little somebody have a 
sad time. 
CHORUS. 
So I'll tell nobody, I'll tell nobody, 
I'll tell nobody, nobody, no. 
So I'll tell nobody, I'll tell nobody, 
I'll tell nobody, nobody, no. 
If I'd tell it to one she would tell it to two. 
The next cup of tea they'd plot what they'd do. 
And as men have no constancy in. 
their own minds, 
He'd seek a 
new face and leave some one behind. 
So I'll tell nobody, &c. 
But when I 
am sure that his heart's all my own, 
That he loves me sincerely and never will roam, 
Oh, then I'll defy all their jeers and their taunts, 
For it shows very plain what it is each of them wants 
CHORUS. 
They all want somebody, they're dying for somebody, 
Somebody, somebody, I 
know who. 
So I'll tell nobody, I'll tell nobody; 
tell nobody, nobody, no.

On a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Such a 
pretty letter, with its perfume sweet, 
Cupid's with their arrows loving hearts to meet, 
Lots of blots for kisses, and a 
seal of blue, 
Meaning that my love is true to you. 
CHORUS. 
For on a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he frills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Conimencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Now who the letter came from I 
of course must tell, 
A 
charming little maiden, and her name is Belle, 
She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea. 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand 
The feelings of my heart, when loving letters reach your hand, 
How 
you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart she has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
For on a 
bright summer, &c. 
Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a 
ship that's sailing o'er the dark blue sea, 
Will bring me such a 
letter, from my sweetheart it will be. 
Then when we are married, I 
will write you all the new, 
Tell you how we get along, and never have the blues, 
What a 
little treasure wife I 
got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L-O- V- E. 
For on a 
bright summer, &c.

KEEP IT MUM. 
Sang by FRANK LEWIS at Colisseum Theatre, Detroit, with great 
itglecess, and at Theatre Comique, and at harry Miner's Theatre, N. Y. 
About twelve o'clock upon one Winter's night, 
Keep it mum; 
When this individual came to light, 
Keep it mum; 
When I 
was a 
lad, I 
was very headstrong, 
With my teacher at school I 
could not get along; 
But I 
hope what I'll tell you to-night in my song, 
You'll keep it mum. 
The husband comes home from his club late at night 
Keep it mum; 
When the sun it is shining at break of daylight, 
Keep it ilium; 
He tells his dear wife he's been out with a 
friend, 
And, of course, it was business he had to attend; 
She believes all he says, ' till in nine months they send 
Well, keep it mum. 
Some wives get religion when parsons do call, 
Keep it mum; 
On a 
glass of old toddy, they glory do bawl, 
Keep it mum; 
The husband goes to labor up town, 
The parson stops at me, do hot frown, 
Alone, when together, they glory rake down, 
But keep it mum. 
Now, there is Bob Ingersoll says there no hell, 
Keep it mum, 
That is the doctrine Robert dots tell, 
Keep it mum; 
Now Bobby may walk, he may preach, he may pray 
And talk about Hyll in his own funny way; 
But, perhaps. he will find it out some future day, 
I 
he'll keep it mum.

I'll Bet You a 
Dollar You Don't, 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
Does any one know what I'm going to say ? 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
If I 
lose the wager, will any one pay, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Gay bachelors say they shall never take wives, 
For as each in his way to be happy contrives, 
They mean to keep single the rest of their lives. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
Find an Irish election without any row, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't, 
Or a 
sirl who-objects to a 
mistletoe bough, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some years of experience teaches me this— 
That from seven to ninety both Mrs. and Miss 
May refuse you this ancient excuse for a 
kiss. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
You may see vaccination a 
thing of the past, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
And heavy taxation abolished at last, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
You may see old John Bull dwindle down to a 
calf, 
And his provender nothing but foreigners' chaff. 
You may see all the ladies too quiet by half, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some ignorant croakers wear visages long, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't? 
And say that to visit amusement is wrong, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
Though to succor distress they can never afford, 
Above human vices they always have soared, 
Still somehow they know every move on the board, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't? 
A 
married man often tries to prove cock-o'- the-walk, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar he don't. 
If he tries to sleep when his wife wants to talk, 
I 
shall bet him two dollars he don't. 
So all you young girls, please attend to this verse, 
And go and get married for better or worse, 
And two little armfuls you may have to nurse, 
Won't bet a 
dollar you don't.

Why, shiver my timbers, just tell 'em from me,

Cnonus: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
Why, shiver my timbers, just tell 'em says he, 
That it's all on account of Eliza. 
I've courted the ladies all through my life, 
All on account of Eliza; 
But never could steer to the proper wife, 
All on account of Eliza; 
I've kissed and I've hugged them in ev'ry port, 
The fat and the lean, the tall and the short; 
But somehow or other, they weren't my sort, 
All on account of Eliza. 
Cnonts: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
But somehow or other, they weren't my sort,

LEFT IRELAND AND MY MOTHER BE-
CAUSE WE WERE POOR. 
Written for and Sung by Andy and Annie Hughes. 
(Copyright, by ANDY HUGHES.) 
There's a 
sweet spot in Ireland, that I 
long to see, 
It's my own native birth-place, and its heaven to me, 
Where my blessed old mother lived there all alone; 
With my brothers and sisters ' twas a 
bright happy home, 
We had'nt much money, but my old mother dear, 
Left a 
kiss on my brow and bade me heart have good cheer, 
And the shadows of poverty crossed on our door, 
I 
left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor. 
I 
will never forget on that bright rosy morn, 
When old Ireland I 
left, how my poor heart did mourn, 
And my aged old mother said, be a 
good cheer, 
Farewell, farewell, Danny darling, good-bye. 
Mother and my brothers and sisters, took me by the hand, 
And bade me do right, when I 
left Ireland, 
And I 
bade them farewell, at our own cottage door: 
And left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor 
New, since leaving old Ireland, my poor mother is dead. 
God bless my dear son, were the last words she aim? 
And the ring that me father gave, she sent to me, 
It's a 
far dearer gem, than bright gold ere could be, 
But my brothers and sisters, sure I 
wish they were here, 
For I'm longing to see them, but they'll come never fear, 
We'll make a 
fine home on America's shore, 
Where happy we'll live, yes, although we be poor.

This sweet little plum, 
This slick and entirely bewilderin' young girl, 
They call little Maggie Ann. 
This rosy Maggie Ann, 
A Vaynus is she, 
Whatever that may be,

She used to be a 
working-man 
Down in a 
laundry fine, 
And wrestle wid discouraged shirts, 
Till wid new life they'd shine. 
But she bekern high-tony, as 
Would any other man, 
And now a

Is little Mary Ann. 
This little, & c.

Then- to the Park wid all the babes 
Glides little Maggie Ann.

When I'm dead and gone from you darling, 
When- I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above; 
To him who my soul will save. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
'See that my grave's kept green.

Oh, the days will come to you darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen, 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me, 
See that my grave's k'ept green. 
Will you keep me, love, in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
While other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word.

The Tramp. 
As recited by DAN COMM. 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Don't you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we ain't no good 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think we 
should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, Cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wile and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? 'Why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from near and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers—none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger—young, handsome, and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
TTe ,vas the man for Nellie—she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried b 
stop it, but you know a 
young gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll say, 
He was a 
soft- tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month or after we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic -with shame and trouble, her mother began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
rn tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, it it takes till the judr 
ment Day.

And so bewitching, too;

LION BREWERY BEER. 
A 
comic effusion sang by FRANK LEWIt, at Harry Miner-a 
Theatre, New York. 
The other night while feeling blue, 
I 
thought I'd stroll around; 
And see some of the famous sights 
With which this town abounds; 
A 
strange sensation thrilled me, 
And my throat felt dry and queer; 
So I 
stepped into a 
beer saloon, 
To get a 
glass of beer. 
I 
found it so refreshing, 
I 
thought I'd try one more; 
And liking the experiment, 
I 
repeated o'er and o'er; 
Some very funny fancies 
To my mind did soon appear, 
I'll tell you some of the sights I 
saw, 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
I 
saw the waiters in this house, 
When schooners they did bring; 
Peep slyly through the door to see 
If the Cap was on the wing; 
I 
saw spy khnball on the train 
Where Whitney round did tear; 
Because he'd not appear in Court, 
And bring the gamblers there. 
Captain Williams in a 
garbage box, 
Was sentenced there to dwell; 
And stay until the Judgment day, 
And live upon the smell; 
The Salvation Army the other night 
Were off upon a 
tear, 
They were found up at Harry Hill's, 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
ION BREWERY BEER—CoNuNuEn. 
We had no railroad accidents, 
And stocks were above par; 
Beecher kept a 
beer saloon, 
John B. Gough tended bar; 
I 
saw Conkling commit suicide, 
When Jim Blaine won the race; 
When they both ran like Garfield's mui 
In his Cabinet for a 
place. 
Steve Taylor and George Rooke I 
saw, 
Fight the other day; 
That is, I 
would have seen them fight, 
But Taylor ran away; 
I 
saw the exhibition start, 
Which Grant is trying to stew; 
I 
saw our dirty streets kept clean 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
And now, kind friends, I'll leave you, 
But there's one thing I 
will say; 
I 
hope I 
have amused you with 
My quiet little lay; 
I 
book it for a 
topic, 
To pass the time along;. 
And try and sing you something new, 
In the way of a 
comic song. 
There's many times that I've appeared 
Before you one and all, 
A warm and loving welcome 
I've received from great and small; 
So to my New York friends 
I 
now return my thanks again, 
I'll drink your health in a 
social glass 
Of Lion Brewery Beer.

Pray let me ask yer pardon,

Just over from the old Country, 
Just over, just over, but I'll soon go back again. 
But now I'm going to leave ye, 
I'm going far away, 
I'm going to leave the land I 
love, 
That's dear America, 
I 
am going back to my birth-plaoe, 
In that little Isle so green, 
The home of all true Irish, 
And the best place that I've se,

Hebrew Politicians. 
5S 
Written b) DAVE HOWARD, and sung with great success by HOWARD 
and THOMPSON at the Windsor Theatre. 
He 
we are two Hebrew politicians, 
When we run for office we got terrible opposition 
From every creed that is known in existence, 
We are the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
When election time does come, lots of promises we do 
make; 
You should see them Hebrew voters how our money 
they do take, 
To go and cast their ballots, ' cause they know we take 
the cake, 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
CHORUS. 
When we go out we dress up nice and neat, 
We eat a 
piece of garlic, to make our breath smell 
sweet ; 
And the gang upon the corner holler, " Sheeneys, float 
your feet," 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
We are going to run for Alderman upon the next elec-
tion; 
Cast your eyes upon us—do you think we'll pass in-
spection? 
And if you want to vote for us, we won't have no 
objection, 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
And when we are elected we will do the best we can, 
We'll give a 
good day's wages to every working man; 
And the people all will say, " For them Sheeneys hij 
hurrah, 
They're the Hebrew politicians of the day." 
When we go out, &c.

The Lads Who Live in Ireland. 
OR, WHERE THE APPLE PRATIES GROW. 
As Sung by DAN NASH, the Great Character Artist. 
My name is Ned O'Manney, I 
was born in sweet Kilarney, 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plow, reap or mow; 
And if I 
meet a 
pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know-, 
I'm none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other shabby 
But can unto my pedigrce a 
pretty title show; 
Oh I 
I'm of the O's and Macs, and likewise the sturdy Whacks. 
CHORUS. 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow, 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree : 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've nin ety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry, 
And each unto their name haea— Mac or an 0 ; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan; 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show, 
L'iu a 
rant in' rovin , 
blade, and I 
never was afraid, 
For I 
was born in Ireland, Sze, 
May Hem en still protect our hospitable Country, 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, and heard its cocks to crova, 
Adieu to its gr een hills and its lovely Bay of Bantry I 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and r 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to Slow, 
Oh I 
those scenes I 
did enjoy like a 
gay unthinking boy, 
With the lads who 'live in Ireland, Sze. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man, in truth was he: 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in out Country, 
And unto other regions it' k 
they were forced to go; 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be; 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show: 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found, 
Illaullag lad ,: 
who live in Ireland, 8:43.

THE LANDLORD'S DAUGHTER. 
(A Parody.) 
Sung with great success by EMERSON & CLARK K. 
H. 
K's. 
—:0: 
In Paris, green Kentucky, 
They keep a 
tramps' hotel, 
And fifty million bedbugs 
In each bed-room used to dwell; 
In each bed-room used to dwell; 
They fed us on valises 
And the crowns of old plug hats, 
And the cook made chicken pot- pie 
From the whiskers of Tom cats. 
Cuonus: 
Each day, each day, each day 
They fed us on salt hay; 
The dogs would bark in the sausage, 
And the cheese would walk away. 
This landlord had a 
daughter, 
Her shoes were very large; 
She hired them out in summer 
To canalers for a 
barge— 
To canalers for a 
barge; 
The hand of the landlord's daughter 
All the bums and tramps would fight 
She boiled her stockings in the coffee 
And poisoned them every night. 
CHORUS: 
Each night, each night, each night. 
It was a 
terrible sight; 
The bugs would fight with the mosquitos 
To hang out in her room at night.

Dedicated to H ARRY M INER, New York. 
The red, red rose that lovely grows, 
And blushes like a 
maiden, 
Keeps nodding to the gentle breeze, 
With rosy perfume laden ; 
To greet a 
little tiny elf, 
For her my heart is yearning; 
And lately I 
am scarce myself, 
My heart with love is blooming. 
CHORUS. 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you love me? 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me? 
While the stars are twinkling in the silent 
Such a 
tale of love I'll tell thee ! 
dell 
(Repeat.) 
The lily all proclaim so fair, 
She is the queen of flowers; 
The rose, they say, conveys true love, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bowers ; 
The Pansie says, " forget me not !" 
The Laurel crowns with glory, 
The one that's fairer than the lot, 
The subject of my story. 
Little Cherry Blossom, & c. 
The dew upon the rose is like 
The tears that she is shedding, 
Impatient for a 
day to come, 
For soon there'll be a 
wedding; 
And from life's garden I 
shall cull 
A 
fair and fragrant flower, 
And keep it blooming all my life, 
Within love's happy bower. 
Little Cherry Blossom, Sze.

" Pretty as a 
Picture." 
Words by TiENNErr and Fuson, and sung by them amid roars of applause 
Filson—Oh, my lung is gone since I 
took that horn, 
Such a 
darling girl waited on me; 
. She looked like a 
star when behind the bar, 
And her hair was the color of clay. 
Such a 
lovely nose, ' twas like a 
rubber hose, 
And her mouth was as wide as the Hudson. 
Such a 
delicious breath, it was certain death 
To the man that buzzed her long. 
She's as handsome (Sym.) 
As a 
funeral, ( Sym.) 
And her voice was like a 
whistle in a 
tug- boat. (Spa.) 
She's my only girl, (Sym.) 
With such a 
lovely curl, (Sym.) 
She's as handsome as the cobwebs on the wall. (Biz.1

For my darling's sake I

Such a

That I 
met down by the brook. 
Bennett—Oh my feet are sore and my clothes an= to,‘, 
Since a 
cross-eyed girl has shook me; 
Such a 
freckled face, teeth out of place, 
That I 
met down by the bay. 
Oh her liver lip, how it used to flip, 
When she tried to talk Italian, 
And her Spanish shoes, number thirty-twos; 
Would cover up the whole sidewalk. 
She's so lazy, (Sym.) 
And she's so crazy, (Sym.) 
And her voice was like a 
fish-horn on a 
She's presumptive, (Sym.) 
And she's consumptive; (Sym.)

for Knave, and numbers 1, 3. to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary tinder 
standing. Many professional Furtune-Telters use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the IT. S.

Courting Cards. — This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse to venture upo n 
aski ng 
the 
momentous 
question. 
The lady i
s restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to he an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoy ed 
by 
evening 
parties   .... Price 25 Cents.

And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah I 
the cruel spoiler came—"

to misery and shame."

A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, No. 24 
Vesey Street, called the " Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would 
only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Untortunatly, there is 
enough of it done without any further necessity of explaining "iani7, 
when and where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book, bound in Morrocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt." Published by A. J. FISHER. No. 24 Vesey Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might 
afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

don edition ( originally published at the price of -9,00), which professes

abided by, or been ruled by the answers of this Oracle. No further lib-
erties have been taken in the translation, than merely to adapt it to the 
usages of this country. 
The questions being more numerous, and the
