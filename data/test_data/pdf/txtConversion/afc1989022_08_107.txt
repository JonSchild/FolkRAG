communicate for her to come along and help. 
And as she learns she 
goes back and teaches her parents. 
Now this is something really 
touching. 
And then you have another thing about this which is really typical 
of the Ita;>.i.ans who immigrated to this country. And it's just one 
line that says that: 'We asked for nothing other than a chance to 
make this country our home, and received so much more in return." 
This is an acknowledgment that a lot of immigrants don't have, a 
lot of Italian immigrants do. 
They come to this country and fall 
in love with it, and work hard to make this country better. Yet, 
they never forget wheie they came from. 
Mrs. Perniciaro. 
Article is dated, Sunday, ,May 15, 1983, Long Beach Press-Telegram. 
GP has also written for the "paper. 
There's a whole wall of 
editorials that GP has written for the Press-Telegram, 
but he 
writes about subjects that are not about immigration. He writes 
about how people should be proud of what they have in this country. 
It should not take an Italian to go public and write that people 
should love America, it should take an American. GP is very proud 
of being an Italian-America. 
It makes sense. 
What GP has today 
is what his country gave him, his education, trying to improve 
himself, wanting to come to this country. 
Once he came here, this 
is the country that has given him a living, put the roof over his 
head, this is the country that is making his children what they 
are. 
GP has to be grateful for that. 
He can never forget what he 
comes from, he will never forget what has come to him. 
GP is proud of all phases of his life. 
If you look at his 
motorcycles, each motorcycle has a plaque on it, 
in bronze, and 
this plaque says, 
"I'm Proud to be an Italian-American." 
There 
are the flags of the United States and Italy, right next to each 
other. 
And that's the way it should be.
