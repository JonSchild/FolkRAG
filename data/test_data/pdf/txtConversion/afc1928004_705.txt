Geo, W. Rice, the Versatile Comedian and author was 
born in Huntington Co, Pa, on the 13th of Sept, 1858, came 
to Pitts, Pa, at the age of 10 with his family, and being a 
great lover of amusements became a 
frequent visitor of the 
then popular variety theatres, and taking a great fancy for 
the stage, began to cultivate what talents be then thought 
he possessed as a 
clog dancer, and song and dance artist by 
going on at dramatic and variety :mature entertainments at 
all of which he became an immediate favorite, as he poss-
essed a 
clear and pleasing delivery, and a 
fine conception of - 
acting. 
After receiving an ordinary education, he began 
life as a 
clerk in his father's store. 
After a 
short period of 
keeping books and selling goods, he began to dislike his vo-
cation, and conceived the idea of adopting a 
professional 
career, and aftcr trying three or four partners, he at last 
formed it. co-partnership with Mr. Chas, Barton, who was 
1116o an anxiotis aspirant for public favor, being very witty • 
and original, and possessing a 
clear and pleasing voice and 
manner. 
ir. Barton was also born in the interior of Pa, at, 
cottville, Huntington Co. Aug. 9th 1857, 
he also came to 
Pi ts. about 1SC9, and- after receiving an education begen

RICE & BARTON. 
CONTINUED. 
Their partnership commenced in the summer of 1875, , 
under the joint cognomens of Rice and Barton, names which 
have since become familiar in every household— made their 
first appearance at Trimbles Varieties on Penn St, near St. 
Clair, the then most popular theatre in Pittsburgh, f 
om 
there they went to Chicago in the spring of 1876, opened at 
the Paris Theatre, opposite the Gault House. 
From there 
they organ'zed a 
small party under their own name, and 
played all the small towns through southern Ill. central 
Powa, but owing to thcir inexperience as managers their en-
terprise met the usual fate, a 
bust up, and no funds in the 
treasury. 
They then made their way to Burlington, Iowa, 
as there was a 
small Variety Theatre in that place. 
They 
became such favorites there that they were engaged for the 
season to do their specialty and put on acts, at which they 
were very clever, after staying thtre twenty six weeks they 
concluded to go West. 
They arrived at Council Bluffs, 
Iowa, without a 
penny, but being as they always have since 
proved, alive to busineSs, they soon procured a 
hall and 
opened a 
Variety Theatre, which turned out very profitable 
during the winter. 
In the spring they joined a 
traveling 
party which played all through Alinneaota, Nebratka, I6tta, 
MissOuria, Illionois and Wis. The party met its death in the 
F'all:of '77 at LaCrosse, Wis. 1 -They Were again without

of saving the show. 
Then they made their way to Milwau-
kee, where they played about five months at the different 
theatres then running in the town. 
About this time the 
fatuous Puck Theatre opened under the manageme t 
of Mr. 
Rice. 
Mr. Barton in the stock company succeeded in Le-
coming one of the most popular comedians ever in Mil-
waukee. 
Mr. Rice through his ever genial manner and 
strict business principles, was not long in achieving great 
success as u 
manager, by making it a 
popular and first c'ass 
place of amusement.— At the expiration of fifteen months of 
tlatteri...g success, Messrs Rice and Barton severed their 
connection with the Puck Theatre, and went to Chicago 
where they were received with much favor, becoming in-
stantaneous and established favorites. 
Since then they 
have been playing at all the strictly first class theatres all 
ft 
all over the entire Eastren and Westren country, and are to-
day known as the lead ng lights of their profession. 
On e 
great feature f 
their performance is that their style is purely 
or:ginal end meritorious, it being their object ever to edify 
as well as entert.in, never indulging in coarse or vulgar wit, 
neither in song or action, either on or off the stage. 
Their 
strict adherence to honor and integrity, both as gentlemen 
and performers, have made them universally popular both

Sung by Rice and Barton. 
Oh ! I'm saddened at heart, I'm sore in the bead, 
The mosquitos have torn all the clothes off my bed, 
1 
ay wake at nights, and kick roar and yell, 
Beeause I've been shook by a 
Bleecker St belle, 
She'd one ear for music and two teeth to chew. 
She'd hair on her 1

like a 
Chatham Street Jew, 
She'd hide her feet when she'd eat, 
Tough storys she'd tell, 
She was long lean and lanky, 
This Bleeker Street belle.

She used to go cruising up and down the main streets, 
Sue had a 
nose on her face that looked like a 
split beat, 
One night she got full and fell in a 
kettle, 
And now she. goes,round vaccinating woits upon pickles 
Her bead it was large and her waist was the same, 
Het oair hung down her back like a 
big horses mane, 
When she'd get left out at night, 
And didn't have any room, 
You could find her in a 
cellar 
Sleeping in a 
spittoon. 
She had a 
fight one night 
With a 
great big bed bug, 
She bad the nightmare the bed post did hug, 
She was smashed on Oscar Wild 
And his big sun flower. 
And she tried to entice him to Cupid's fair bower, 
Bin Oscar he kicked and said he must git, 
And es he gazed in her face. 
He fell down in a 
fit, 
They bron lit him to with a 
club, 
And an elephant's trunk, 
And now he's left town 
And gone to 8quedunk,

Tramp. 
RECUSTION. 
Written expressly for Miss Nettie Weston. 
By her trio d 
Geo. R. Ma guard. 
While taking a 
stroll one fine evening, 
I 
was stopped by a 
tramp on the way. 
Who said, won't you help me, I'm starving, 
I 
haven't a'e nothing to-day. 
l've been begging so hard since this morning, 
For a 
crust of the Lord's daily bread. 
With a 
curse or a 
kick they refuse me, 
And it's now that I 
wished I 
was dead, 
bt lieved the poor man was in earnest, 
I 
gave him some money for food, 
He smiled as be took it and thanked me, 
He said I 
had done his heart good, 
I 
asked him to tell me his story, 
You would not believe it, he said, 
I 
was born and brought up of good parents, 
But alas, I'm alone; they are dead. 
I 
was quite young when mother departed, 
I 
stood at her bed when she died. 
And just two years the following winter, 
My father was laid by her side, 
That w s

bitter blow stranger, 
A

father or mother to guide him

A LEAF FRO3I THE HISTORY OF A TRAMP. 
CONTINUED. 
I 
asked some good ue ghbors to help me, 
The called me a 
rogue and a 
scamp, 
They told mc I'd never be nothing, 
I've shown them I 
could be a 
tramp. 
I 
have been in the worst hied of company, 
And have traveled with thieves in my day. 
But you s 
e 
U he honest and upright, 
Its best to keep out of their way. 
Quite often I've wished that I'd stolen, 
I'd at least have a 
home in some jail, 
Then again I 
would hear something whisper, 
Be honest, John. and you won't fail, 
It's hard when I 
think of it stranger, 
I 
might have been something to- day, 
if I'd had a 
good mother to watch me, 
Or a 
friend that would teach me the way, 
If they'd only a 
kind word have spoken, 
Or shown me what I 
ought to do, 
If they'd tuId me I 
ought to have s
.choolng, 
I 
could thank them as I 
h ye thanked you. 
But no it eenied too much trouble, 
Perhaps I 
was reckless end wild, 
But you know I 
was young and knew nothing, 
A pone orphan and nobody's child, 
Now stranger I 
guess I'll be leaving, 
You've given a 
poor tramp a 
bite, 
May the good Lord in heaven be with y

For the kindness you've done me his night,

The Bums,

By Earl Remington. 
Dedicated to RI o Barton. 
Out of a 
lunch route, starvation in vi w, 
Now what are two bums in our place to do ? 
Weary we wander, our bunions are bad 
We're loo ing for graf and there's none to ho had. 
Cheesing,--I mean choosing rittlwr to steal than to di ,. 
Oh ! for the corner of a 
good pumpkin pie 
Weary we wander, cheeky we roam, 
Our story is, we have kid starving ), t, home. 
Now why shall a 
man, be Chinese or Turk, 
Be refused a 
square meal because be won't work, 
We've tac led every house in your rotten old town, 
Till our gall is all gone and nerve broken down. 
Oh ! heaving's, ' twere better by far to be dead— 
Drunk, for the money you get to buy bread, 
No grub, no mon, cig rless we roam, 
Say cull, we'll Lave to get a 
newer gag than 
Kids starving at home.

Parody on a Violet Prom 
Mother's Grave. 
By Geo. W. Rice. 
Performed by Rice and Barton. 
Papa was an old rounder, 
And they called him Mike the lush, 
And when he got a 
nickel, 
For a 
gin mill he would rush. 
He once was fixed in business, 
And from poverty did rise, 
He used tJ ni..ke a 
fortune 
Selling suits of clothe for flies, 
He was a 
Free Mason, a 
Democrat, 
A 
Socialist and a 
king. 
His nan e 
was often registered 
in that place they call Sing Sing. 
But while I 
spit and sweat I 
never will forget 
When I 
stole his watch and chain and diamond ring 
Cumius. 
Only a 
racket, yes I 
mean a 
good drunk, 
And often with a 
swelled head l've arose, 
But while I 
am insane, I'll keep printed on my brain 
! 
that pawn shop wheie I 
hocked my papa's 
He got up one Sunday morning 
Looking for his Sunday suit, 
He found out where I 
put it., 
And he pulled a 
razor for to shoot, 
I 
jumped clean through the window, 
No spare time did I 
lose, 
Then you could hear him two miles kicking, 
For his old high hat and shoes, 
He was a 
sn ozer. a 
cruizer. a 
boozer and a 
beat. 
Drunk twentp-nine days ot the Mouth, 
On the thirtieth he would eat. 
He was born in French Peru 
He was fresh and too bran new, 
And be could float a 
large size steamer on his rt-f-t.

Only a 
policeman's club. 
And it weighed one hundred pounds, 
The moon and stars I

When his boot. just reached for my pants, 
Wher. 's

Parody on the Old Fashioned 
Photograph. 
By Jas. Ilichmond, for Rice & Barton. 
There's an old fashioned house and it stands down 
the lane, 
The roof was in the c 
Aler, and lets in the snow and rain; 
Oh ! it's where I 
was born and . pent twenty dizzy years, 
Stabbing geese and turkeys there, and cutting off 
pig's ears. 
My mother was a 
blacksmith my sister tended bar, 
My father he could drink a 
barrel of booze, 
And he'd sleep down in the gutter till they'd carry 
him on a 
shutter, 
My old drunken papa dear, that used to pawn his shoes. 
CHORUS. 
For it's well I 
remember that dizzy old tin type. 
I 
found it, yes, in one of grand pa's hats, 
And I 
hung it on the wall to remind me of his-gaul, 
That old fashioned photograph that used to scare the rats. 
There was a 
sweet Turkish blonde, and they called 
her Sarah Jones, 
She weighed ninety ounces, eighty five of that was bones, 
When she travels with a 
chcus she went out upon a 
drunk 
And during a 
fit of insanity she got married to the monk. 
Her papa and her mamma they tried to break the match, 
But on the fourth of last July, 
They got froze and not a 
word of lie, 
But I 
often sit and cry about that old fashioned 
Turkish blonde 
With warts upon her nose.

I 
always will remember, that's if I 
don't forget, 
I'd always sneak from school when I 
got a 
chance, 
Then the old man he would tunable, and I 
wouldn't

The one pulls ribbons from his mouth, and the other has

Only to see you, darling, 
Only to hear your voice,

Once more before we part.

Vanished in darkest night.

Theatres in America. 
-: 0 :----
A 
short time ago when in Erin's green isle, 
Where freedom for ages has not dared to smile; 
I 
journeyed o'er mountains, through valley and plain 
And what I 
beheld, may I 
ne'er see again. 
A 
cabin I 
saw, but deserted it seemed, 
The Wintry sun on its roof cheerlessly gleamed; 
No smoke from the chimney curled up to the sky, 
Nor was there a 
trace of life as I 
drew nigh. 
The deadly wolf want, though, in that cot did reign, 
The struggle to keep him out had been in vain; 
Appalled, there I 
stood, touched to the heart's core, 
Now, I'll tell you my thoughts, as I 
stood by the door 
A 
child's voice I 
heard, it was puny and weak, 
In faltering tones the poor creature did speak; 
It begged very hard for a 
small piece of bread, 
Its mother through hunger, lay silent and dead. 
The father looked on, ahl but helpless was he, 
The sight, I 
am sure, it was dreadful to see; 
All in the place had been seized on for rent, 
The landlords with nothing else would be content. 
Assistance I 
gave, but, alas! 'twas too late, 
Child followed mother, a 
terrible fate; 
May I 
never again have such scenes to deplore, 
These were my thoughts, as I 
stood by the door.

THE BANKS OF THE POTOMAC. 
Written by EDWARD HARRIGAN, and sung by him in his beauti-
ful sketch of " The Blue and the Gray." 
On the banks of the Potomac, 
I 
am lonely here to- night, 
Sure I'm waiting for the enemy 
To come out here and fight; 
Arrah, when this war is over, 
Oh, I 
will bless the day, 
Let me be dead or living, 
I'd praise America. 
But sure I 
can't help thinking 
Of the girl I 
left behind, 
A 
rosy Irish lassie, 
So loving and so kind; 
My dear old grey-haired mother, 
I 
left there all alone, 
I'd feel like young Napoleon, 
When I 
go marching home. 
Oh, a 
soldier's life is tedious, 
When he's laying loose in camp, 
We never have excitement 
Unless we're on a 
tramp; 
A 
short life and a 
merry one, 
Is generally our lot, 
Till we get our life-long furlough, 
From the enemy's heavy shot. 
If a 
soldier's never kilt, 
Oh, he's smothered up in luck, 
Should he lose an ear or finger, 
Or be wid a 
bagnet struck; 
He can get a 
pair of crutches, 
From the doctor, it's well known, 
And feel like the King of Persia, 
When he goes marching how..

ANGEL'S CALL. 
i-7ritten by J. 
K. 
JOHNSON. Sung and made popular by DAN COLLYER. 
As the sun is resting gently, 
At the close of this fair day; 
Angels fair from heavenly mansions, 
Gently, gladly float away; 
Through the halls of golden splendor, 
Through the maze of.azure sky; 
Pause they o'er a 
cottage threshold, 
Where a 
bud has bloomed to die; 
Cltorns.—Sweet heavenly music, 
Dear cherubic band; 
I 
will sing with you soon, 
In sweet glory land. 
Hark, and hear the faintest whisper, 
Friends, I'm really going there; 
There's a 
host of angel's truly. 
Floating round me everywhere; 
Cherubs robed in dazzling splendor, 
With immortal crowns of light; 
I 
shall view them all in glory, 
In that land that is so bright. 
Ch.rus.—They are taking me now, 
On their bosoms I 
lie; 
I'm going to glory, 
Dear friends, sweet, good-bye. 
As the sun is setting, gently, 
At the close of this fair day; 
As I 
wander o'er the foliage, 
Thinking of days past away; 
There are heavenly visions round me, 
Heavenly visions everywhere; 
For the mound in yonder church-yard, 
Represents an angel fair. 
Choms.—She's sleeping so sweetly, 
Oh, there let her rest; 
With roses and lillies, 
Ynon her pure breast.

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
CHORUS: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo. 
He played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a 
con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants.

Mrs. McNally had sixteen shirts upon a

And a

'Young Kelly's son he stole them and he pawned them, 
You can bet she chased the young kid from the door. 
Last night her daughter Mary Ann the speeler, 
Was standing with a 
young man she met before, 
dome one dropped out a 
scuttle full of cinders, 
To chase the dizzy lovers from the door,

From Jacob McCarthy's german grocery store, 
When he tr:es to collect his bill they give him warning, 
And chase the po(ir 041 milliman from the door.

America the Land of the Free! 
Written and sung by MR. Tom Emma. 
Respectfully dedicated to the Veterans of the 69th New Tort 
Regiment Volunteers. 
Oh! I've lately come from America, the land of the brave 
and free ! 
Where peace and plenty now does reign; 
And an Irishman, there, is as good as may one, 
Although he may be a 
little green. 
When first I 
crossed the water and landed on their shore, 
They extended then, to me, a 
welcome hand; 
And they said, you're welcome here, your country to us is 
dear, 
And we love you, the Irishman. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for America, the land of the free! 
Sure that's the place, ray boys, where there is no 
slavery. 
Oh! I 
had not been there very long when a 
war broke out, 
And spread its desolation over the land; 
When they called upon the Irishman to help go and fight, 
I 
gave to them, then, a 
helping hand ; 
I 
enlisted in the ranks with many a 
noble man, 
Along with brave Corcoran and his noble crew I 
And they marched us down South to what they call Dixie's 
land, 
To fight for the Red, White and Blue! 
Then hurrah for America, kc. 
There is a 
nation that's been trying to cause America 
trouble, 
Of course, I 
mean the country called Spain! 
But she'd better mind her business or she soon will see, 
What is her loss will be America's gain; 
For with Cuba annexed unto the United States, 
We'll add to their banner another star ; 
And I 
hope that Ireland soon will, like America, be free! 
And you bet, the time is not so very far. 
Then hurrah for America, le.

To marry me, not one of them cams; 
So I'll let them all go to the diva,

the great JOHN REILLY. 
Arrah, give me your attention every one, 
And hear what I've to say ; 
It's all about a

That's bound to have her way.

For the stage sure she's got spooney. 
And now she's got a 
date, and is making out first-rate, 
Imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she walks, shure she catches the gawks, 
By my sowl I

On me she's brought disgrace since she went off her base, 
Imitating a

Sure she sends out letters every day, 
And tells me she's writing for dates, 
And I 
ask her for God's sake to give it up, 
She says go away your feet ain't mates. 
Sure the actors all give her the laugh, 
And say that her act is Juney ; 
The gilliei she does mash, she gets seven dollats cash, 
For imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. 
CHORUS. 
Shure she washed up in Pat Rooney's sponge, 
And stole his dialect; 
She tried to do his funny run off, 
And nearly broke her neck.

"DAN DORKINS.""5 
[Burlesque poernj 
by PAT ROONEY, the 1),I ,les* favorite, with rounds of 
applause. 
The theatre was full, and so was the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going' to appear 
That night in a 
hare- footed slack wire 'log, 
For he was the pompey round here. 
The bar-room was perfectly crowded with beats, 
Who waited a 
pleasant surprise; [ out, 
For they knew they would eat when the lunch was sel 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose and so did the people, 
Who commenced for to shout and hurrah; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
And they gave him the laugh and " Yah, yahl" 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure; 
"He's away off his base," says old Joe Jewell, 
Who never went back on the poor. 
,A. brick! yes, it was! I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark-red for two; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
And continually dropping his cue. 
lie says: ' I'm a 
king!' when a woman jumped up 
And says: " You lie, you are one of the gang!" 
It knocked Dorkins cold, be owed her for washing, 
And his head on his breast lie did hang. 
At length to the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
have not drank enough Bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer: 
When O'Leary and I 
walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish ould ' Sam Sandford' was here. 
You insult me to-night, and say I 
am sober, 
Let Tony Pastor play Hamlet alone; 
I'll tell you the reason, I

Words by BENNETT and FILSON, and sung by them amid roars of applaw,1 
Filson—Oh, ray lung is gone since I 
took that horn, 
Such a 
darling girl waited on me; 
She looked like a 
star when behind the bar, 
And her hair was the color of clay. 
Such a 
lovely nose, ' twas like a 
rubber hose, 
And her mouth was as wide as the Hudson. 
Such a 
delicious breath, it was certain death 
To the man that buzzed her long. 
She's as handsome (Sym.) 
As a 
funeral, ( Sym.) 
And her voice was like a 
whistle in a 
tug-boat. (Sym.) 
She's my only girl, (Sym.) 
With such a 
lovely curl, (Sym.) 
She's as handsome as the cobwebs on the wall. ( Biz.1

my life would take 
Just as freely as I 
would a

Such a 
lovely maid with teeth just like a

That I 
met down by the brook. 
Bennett—Oh my feet are sore and my clothes aro tore 
Since a 
cross-eyed girl has shook me; 
Such a 
freckled face, teeth out of place, 
That I 
met down by the bay. 
Oh her liver lip, how it used to flip, 
When she tried to talk Italian, 
And her Spanish shoes, number thirty- twos. 
Would cover up the whole sidewalk. 
She's so lazy, (Sym.) 
And she's so crazy, (Sym.) 
And her voice was like a 
fish-horn on a 
Friday. 
She's presumptive, (Sym.) 
And she's consumptive; (Sym.) 
And her mouth would cover up a

great success at the Theatre Comique, ti. Y. 
Motto songs of every kind, 
Have through the world been sung; 
But I 
have one, the truest one, 
You'll say so when I'm done; 
A 
tale of woe I 
will unfurl, 
A 
sad one you will own; 
You'll curse the day you saw the world, 
If you don't leave drink alone. 
CHORUS: 
Boys, leave drink alone, 
If happy you would live; 
Boys, leave drink alone, 
To you this good advice I

Once I 
was a 
happy man, 
And had a 
loving wife; 
She said I'll do what I 
e'er can, 
If you quit the drunkard's life; 
The kind words that she gave to me, 
I 
hurl back in her face; 
Now those once happy lives we lived, 
We now must live apace. 
This is a 
tale I 
know that's true, 
As in the world you live; 
And in these lines I'll prove to you, 
The story that I 
give; 
You seem in doubt, you won't be long, 
When I 
tell you, you will start; 
The tale that I 
told in this song, 
Is from this broken heart,

Oh, ain't von naughty, to talk to me so, 
• No, I 
won't let you, now please let me go, 
I'll lie 
mad" and to you I'll never speak, 
You're " horrid," you're " awful," ain't you got 
a 
cheek 
It's awful, when for a 
caress you're inclined, 
A maiden should act so unjust and unkind, 
This motive alone she can have I 
am sure, 
The Dower received will be valued the more, 
And thus they're so artful and cunning the elves, 
When we know they would '' like to" as well as 
ourselves, 
And so I'm perplexed and the point I 
can't see, 
'When covered with blushes she cries out to me— 
CITORts. — Oh, ain't you naughty, to talk to me so, etc. 
Some day we'll be married, Oh, thrice happy day 
Then all affectation will be cast away, 
Then I 
shall enfold her in these loving arms, 
And shield her forever from earth's wild alarms, 
Joy, joy then shall reign in this bosom supreme, 
Life then will be real, not a 
delusive dream, 
I'll kiss her, caress her, do just as I 
please, 
And will not be amazed by such words as these— 
CiloRts.—Oh, ain't you naughty, to talk to meso, ete.

SOMETHING TO TICKLE THE GIRLS. 
Written by A. W . 
FRENCH. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique. 
Music by T. B. KELLEY. 
The pet of the girls ey'ry where, 
Society calls me a 
wit; 
For nothing gets on unless there, 
I 
drop in to please them a 
bit ;-
I've stories not few, and jokes that are new, 
As brilliant they tell me as pearls: 
Nonsense now and then is liked by all men, 
Of course it will tickle the girls. 
CitoRus• 
Someth_ng to tickle the girls, 
Laughing and shaking their curls; 
You'll not go amiss, I 
promise you this, 
With something to tickle the girls. 
Some chaps they are terrible bores, 
Some spoony and dull as a 
hoe; 
No kind that a 
gay girl adores, 
She favors no one who is slow; 
Some fellows are shy, and others they try, 
To please when as crabbid as churls; 
I'm not either one, I 
can revel in fun, 
And can always tickle the girls. 
(Chorus). 
Then take my advice ev'ry one, 
And put it at once to the test; 
Go in with the girls and have fun, 
For that is just what suits them best; 
They like a 
gay heart, who does well his part, 
To cheer them as life swiftly whirls; 
You're always their friend, to love and commend, 
With something to tickle the girls. 
(Chorus). 
AWE.

ant a 
quiet, sober man, 
My mune is_ Johnnie McGee, 
I 
work all day and pay my way, 
But one thing troubles me: 
I'm getting thin for want of sleep, 
My head with pain is sore, 
And the cause of all my trouble 
Is the family next door. 
Giro ttus: 
They'll drink and smoke, and laugh and joke, 
Like Cannibals they do roar; 
ina kept awake the whole night long 
Bv the family next door. 
They beat their children every day, 
They have them blacl; and blue; 
And when the landlord comes for rent, 
Lord knows they beat him, too. 
They'll turn his pockets inside out 
As he lays upon the floor, 
There the toughest nuts in all the town, 
Is the family next door, 
What is it?

very ,trange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
many queer remarks 1 
hear about me every day;

And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what LI

SPOKEN—As 
soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here ic

approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it ? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare. 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green! 
SPOKEN—Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
Look out for it, 
it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum— 
What is it, &T. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when wcc 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
Pipe , 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !"

One day while walking down the street., 
A damsel I 
by chance did meet, 
With airs so blythe and free. 
Her eyes were of the deepest blue, 
Her hair a 
chestnut brown; 
She look'd and sliiled and winked her eye, 
And then to her I 
said ;—Ah! 
Oh! you little darling, I 
love you! 
Caonrs. 
Oh! you little darling, are you true? 
If you really love me as you ought to do, 
There's nothing in this wor d 
Can cut our love in two. 
I 
asked her if along with me, 
She'd like to lake a 
stroll ? 
And if agreeable to her 
We'd do Delmonico's. 
She sail she'd go along with me, 
And tossed her pretty head, 
And then, as if by impulse 
She turned to me and said:—Ah I 
Oh you little darling, 1 
love you.

want of means ot

way as to be non-committal. 
alawyoung ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too (hill

too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
qtrtIon. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety. 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover eN cry 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation im 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players,
